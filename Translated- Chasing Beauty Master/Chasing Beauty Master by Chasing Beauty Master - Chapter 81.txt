Chapter 196: Another Windfall

Though he’d made a profit, Guan Yu hesitated. Among the six remaining stones in his rented car was a washbasin-sized black rock purchased for four hundred thousand yuan. Within it lay an incomparably rare jadeite, worth ten thousand times its weight in gold. Revealing it here would instantly achieve his goal of impressing Du Xiaojuan’s family. Yet doing so would also unleash unimaginable dangers!

To cut or abandon it? Guan Yu couldn’t decide!

Though gifted with supernatural abilities and trained in the Bone-Shattering Fist, Guan Yu doubted he could survive thirty seconds against multiple armed pursuers. The risks were astronomical!

When devising this money-making scheme, he’d vaguely anticipated dangers and envy. Yet he never imagined threats could emerge so brazenly in such a crowded public space. Ka~

But judging by the hostile glares and whispered conspiracies around him, Guan Yu realized the situation had spiraled beyond control!

This gamble was far riskier than winning eight million earlier. Back then, he could call Feng Xin for help. Now, stranded at Yunnan’s remote border with no connections, he stood alone.

"Young man, will you continue cutting?" The stone-cutting master wiped his brow, smiling breathlessly. Though exhausting, sculpting glacial jadeite with his own hands filled him with lifelong pride.

Guan Yu gritted his teeth. "Cut!"

Since danger already loomed over his six million, why fear making bigger waves?

Noting the late hour, Guan Yu stood and retrieved a raw stone from the rented car. "Master, rest awhile. Let me try my hand!"

"Sure!" The Master Wang readily agreed, as many customers enjoyed the thrill of cutting stones themselves. He toweled his neck and sipped tea nearby.

Using his Detection Art, Guan Yu confirmed this stone held no jade. He secured it and sliced ruthlessly.

Within minutes, the small stone lay in fragments—empty.

Onlookers shook their heads bitterly. Fate truly favored fools! This clueless youth possessed heaven-defying luck to find glass-grade jadeite. His crude cutting technique proved him a reckless amateur.

"Nothing!" Guan Yu scratched his head and grabbed another stone.

Several cuts later—still nothing.

"Again! Damn it!" He seized a third stone containing faint green traces—a four-thousand-yuan purchase that might break even.

Guided by Detection Art, Guan Yu aligned the blade precisely.

"Green! Haha!" His excited jumps drew crowds surging forward, only to deflate at the mediocre jade revealed.

Still numb from witnessing glacial jadeite earlier, the crowd showed little enthusiasm for this mid-grade green.

"Young man, sell it? Forty thousand!"

"Forty thousand?" Guan Yu glanced around.

"Fifty thousand!" another bidder shouted.

After cross-cutting to reveal more green and frosty undertones, the stone sold for one hundred ten thousand.

"This kid’s luck defies heaven! A whole carload of winning stones!"

News spread, drawing shopkeepers and jade merchants until the store overflowed.

Only the cutting area remained spacious.

Licking his lips, Guan Yu eyed the final stone. Its emerald-green core, denser than gemstones and flawlessly transparent, promised staggering value. Though unclear of its exact classification, online comparisons had convinced him to gamble.

The earlier glacial jadeite, while valuable, wasn’t premium "old pit" quality—the middle-aged expert had explained this, much to Guan Yu’s chagrin. Sold as old pit roughs, these stones had swindled him.

But this last piece… Two bowl-sized green cores glowed within the black rock. Their combined worth might rival the previous find.

After adjusting the stone’s position twice, Guan Yu pushed the blade.

As the saw whined, water flushed away stone dust, unveiling a bowl-sized green glow.

"Green! It’s green!" Sharp-eyed spectators shrieked, straining for a better look.

Grinning, Guan Yu wiped the cut surface and asked Master Wang, "Master, is this valuable?"

Hearing "another win," Master Wang rose leisurely—then froze, spraying tea in shock. His eyes bulged as if seeing a ghost.

Chapter 197: One-Punch Knockout

Bystanders sharing the view gaped in disbelief. Ka~

"This…" Master Wang stammered, beckoning the refined Mr. Li. "Old Li—am I hallucinating? Is this old pit glacial jadeite?"

The master’s trembling jaw and twitching cheeks betrayed overwhelming excitement.

After two stunned seconds, Mr. Li stepped forward. "Indeed, old pit glacial—wait!" Leaning closer, he inhaled sharply. "Emerald-green glacial jade? Can’t be…"

Emerald-green—the supreme color among jadeites. If confirmed, this stone would be priceless perfection.

"Emerald-green?" Master Wang rushed to inspect it, then begged Guan Yu, "Young sir, let me carefully grind the edges!"

"Stop grinding! Four million—I’ll take it!" A bald giant shoved through the crowd.

Recognizing him, Master Wang shrank back fearfully.

"Boy, sell it! Test my luck?" The brute’s tone mocked negotiation, his face threatening violence.

Guan Yu shrugged. "I’ll keep cutting."

"Three million—leave the stone and go!"

"Not about money. I want to see if it’s better!" Guan Yu met the man’s glare unflinchingly.

"Two million!"

"Not selling!"

"Want to die on this street?" The giant openly threatened—a display of power only possible for local gang royalty.

"Stop grandstanding!" Guan Yu sneered. Since appeasement wouldn’t work, he saw no need for courtesy.

"You’re dead!" The giant roared, launching a thunderous kick at Guan Yu’s spine.

As the boot neared, Guan Yu pivoted, hurling the stone aside. His right fist whipped around like a spinning top—CRACK!

The punch smashed the giant’s cheekbone, spraying blood and teeth. Before the body hit ground, Guan Yu leaped, knees crushing the man’s chest, finishing with a skull-crushing hammer fist—restrained at the last moment to avoid murder.

Even without his Gravity Art’s full power, the strike left the giant convulsing, nose gushing blood.

A one-punch knockout. The crowd stood petrified—this youth had felled a titan!

Chapter 198: The Prodigy

Guan Yu dusted his hands dismissively, retrieved the jade, and approached Master Wang.

"Oh, why fight? Trouble!" The master fretted, slapping his thigh.

"Broad daylight—who dares act lawlessly?" Guan Yu scanned the crowd coldly.

As Master Wang resumed grinding, the groaning giant staggered up, pointed vengefully at Guan Yu, and limped away.

"Young sir, flee! He’s from the Yellow Earth Gang—connected to foreign syndicates!" A whisper warned.

Guan Yu smiled gratefully but stayed. With countless eyes coveting his jade, escape seemed impossible. Better secure his treasures first. If needed, he’d provoke police intervention for sanctuary.

Ten minutes later, Master Wang gasped. "Mr. Li—emerald-green glacial jade!"

Silence gripped the crowd as all stared at the youth.

After glacial jadeite’s earlier marvel, this supreme emerald-green defied belief. The revealed jade radiated serene majesty, transfixing viewers into awed stillness.

"Emerald-green… A lifetime’s privilege! Young man, your name?" Mr. Li asked warmly.

"Guan Yu."
