“Since I’ve taken you as my own, I won’t abandon you—rest assured of that. But let me be blunt: as my woman, obedience is non-negotiable,” Guanyu warned.

“Does that mean I must obey you in everything? Can’t I have opinions of my own?” Wang Xiaorong replied, her tone laced with feigned sweetness. Complete submission to Guanyu was unthinkable. What if he someday demanded she kill her own father under Yunqing Sect’s banner? Such treachery was unacceptable. She resolved to draw a line.

“Don’t worry. I’ll never ask you to act against your conscience,” Guanyu conceded. “But our relationship must remain secret for now. If exposed, my standing in Yunqing Sect would crumble.”

“Fine. I’ll comply and keep us hidden.”

“Not even the Demon Lord can know. This stays between us,” Guanyu emphasized.

“I understand. I won’t oppose your ambitions in Yunqing Sect.” Xiaorong respected his choices. Her affection for him was simple, untainted by ulterior motives. “I’m with you because I like you—purely, genuinely. I don’t scheme to drag you into the Demon Soul Sect. You needn’t fear coercion from me.”

Aware their conflicting allegacies barred open companionship, she added, “But I ask one promise.”

“What?”

“If the day comes when you face my father under Yunqing’s banner… should he fall, spare his life.”

Guanyu arched a brow. His presence in Yunqing wasn’t for righteous crusades. Perhaps truths needed sharing. “You doubt the Demon Lord’s strength? Do you truly believe I could defeat him? That’s decades away, if ever.”

“Time flies. You’re a freak of dual cultivation—martial and magical. In years, even Father won’t rival you.” Xiaorong shuddered at the ominous aura clinging to Guanyu. Whether through combat or escape, she sensed he’d survive any confrontation, despite his current modest cultivation.

With the Eight-Sided Drum technique and dual prowess, his ascent to dominance seemed inevitable. Yunqing Sect might eclipse the Demon Soul Sect entirely if he remained.

“I’ll never oppose the Demon Lord,” Guanyu stated flatly. “Helping Yunqing with occasional tasks passes time, but I won’t bleed for them.”

“But if war erupts between our sects, you and Father would be mortal enemies!”

“Don’t lump me with brainwashed disciples,” Guanyu scoffed. “I cultivate here for personal goals, not sect loyalty. Your father’s safe from my blade.”

Xiaorong tilted her head. “Why? Yunqing disciples revere their sect.”

“Fame and power mean nothing. I seek neither supremacy nor heroism—just the life I desire.”

“What life?”

“To heal my body through cultivation and return home.” Guanyu met her gaze. “There’s something you should know. In my homeland… I already have wives.”

He braced for explosion. Xiaorong’s eyes widened with betrayal. “Wives? Plural?”

“Truthfully, several women share my home. We’re unwed and childless, but committed.”

“Why?” Her voice quivered. “How can you call them wives without marriage?”

“In my land, we say ‘girlfriends’—your equivalent of fiancées.”

“So you’re a philanderer with multiple fiancées?”

“All chose freely to live with me. No man resists beauty’s lure, but I’ve never forced affection.”

**Chapter 3577: Dissatisfaction**

“Though unblessed by ceremony, we’ve consummated bonds,” Guanyu pressed. “If you stay with me, you must accept them when we return.”

Xiaorong’s heart fractured. After finally loving a man, she must share him? Unthinkable! Suitors once lined for her favor, yet she chose this—this harem keeper? The injustice scalded.

“Where is this homeland? When do you leave?”

“Uncertain. I’ll cultivate here until breaking my mental seal. My home lies beyond distant horizons you’ve never tread.”

“Could you… never return?” The words choked her. Sharing repelled her—spoiled daughter of the Demon Lord, accustomed to claiming desires unchallenged.

Guanyu shrugged. “Unlikely, but who knows?”

“I hate this!” She pinched his arm viciously. “I want you whole!”

“Too late, isn’t it?” He chuckled through pain.

“You tricked me! Never mentioned those women!”

“You never asked. This… unfolded unexpectedly.”

Would she have loved him knowing? Perhaps. Now, resignation tempered her anger. “Swear this: the Yunqing girl Siqi—you’ll never touch her. If you do, I’ll kill her.”

Guanyu shivered at her venom. The demand seemed fair—Siqi remained just a sect sister. “Agreed. She’ll stay merely that.”

“Good. If you crave women, come to me. Stray, and I’ll slaughter every temptress.” Her glare promised blood.

Guanyu nodded solemnly, though her possessiveness unnerved him. This mirrored Yang Conghan’s initial pride—how she’d reluctantly accepted his polygamy. Xiaorong too would adapt… or languish in stubborn isolation.

She sighed. The blame wasn’t his—she’d drugged him first, claiming what she thought was an unclaimed prize. Discovering rivals stung, but his distant homeland offered reprieve. For now, he was hers alone.

“This mental seal—is it dangerous?” she asked abruptly. “Father could help break it.”

Guanyu shook his head. Even the Demon Lord couldn’t unravel this curse. “The seal locks most qi and memories. It’s… demonic.”

“Demonic? How?”

“Before this, I was a Boundary Sovereign.”

Xiaorong gaped. “Sovereign? You jest!”

“Would I boast idly? The seal prevents proof.”

**Chapter 3578: Long Hair**

“Tell me everything!” Xiaorong leaned close, enthralled. “Demonic seals—fascinating!”

“My past is fragmented. What I know: a demonic entity sealed me during an Arctic battle. Though I slew it, the curse remains.”

“You fought demons?” She shuddered. “They’re invincible!”

Guanyu smirked. “Nonsense. As a Sovereign, I feared none. The seal’s my only defeat.”

Adoration lit her face. A Sovereign! Such power—if restored, he’d eclipse all. Suddenly, sharing him seemed… prudent. Who could monopolize a legend?

“Can the seal break?”

“Possibly with a Sovereign’s relic. But acquiring one…” He trailed off. The quest itself could unravel worlds.
