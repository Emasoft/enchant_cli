Anyone with some cultivation could see that the silver needles Locke launched were no ordinary projectiles. Each was coated with a lethal poison called "Jiu Yu Qian Ye (Nightshade Plume)." A mere touch would induce unbearable itching, swiftly spreading through the body and internal organs, subjecting victims to living torment worse than death.

“Elder Kyle, dodge now!”

Despite Guanyu’s swift warning, Locke’s madness had driven him to target even the spectators. Guanyu unleashed his full power, releasing a powerful qi barrier that repelled the venomous needles.

Though Guanyu shielded dozens of nearby elves, his relief shattered as Elder Kyle collapsed, vomiting blackened blood. The elder’s purpled face betrayed advanced poisoning.

“Locke, you vile beast!” Guanyu roared. “These are your own kin! Today, I’ll take your wretched life to avenge the fallen!”

Locke sneered, “Kin? Where were they when I needed aid? They’re worthless leeches! As for that obstinate old fool Kyle—he deserved his fate!”

Cold despair gripped Guanyu’s heart. This explained Locke’s atrocities—the man recognized no moral bounds, viewing others as mere tools.

“Hypocrite!” Locke spat. “You stole my rightful place as chief! Those deaths are on your hands. Since you pity them, join their ghosts!”

Another barrage of Silver Rain Needles flew—not at Guanyu, but toward bystanders. The tactic forced Guanyu into desperate defense, unable to counterattack. His missing companion, Bikacat, compounded his frustration.

“That traitorous furball! I’ll roast him post-battle!”

As Guanyu cursed, Locke vanished. A girl’s scream pierced the air: “Dragonkin brother, save me!”

Guanyu’s blood ran cold—Locke had seized Amy. The madman pressed a corrupted Profound Black Sword to her throat, its edge gleaming wickedly.

“Release her, and we’ll negotiate!” Guanyu demanded.

Locke laughed wildly. “Fool! You linger here solely to exploit the chief’s daughter! Claim her, and half the Elvenwoods falls to you!”

“Lies!” Amy cried, defiance burning through her terror. “Brother Guanyu would never!”

Her unwavering trust struck Guanyu deeply. In two lifetimes, none had believed in him so completely. His feelings for her—protective or romantic?—remained unresolved, but survival came first.

“You once loved her, Locke!” Guanyu shouted. “How can you harm her?”

“Love?” Locke’s voice cracked. “You ruined everything—my chiefdom, my bride! Die now, and I’ll spare her!”

The blade kissed Amy’s neck. Chief Allen’s roar echoed: “Harm her, and I’ll rend you limb from limb!”

Guanyu’s mind raced. Charging risked Amy’s life. “Locke, what do you want?”

“Your corpse as my exit ticket! Your death buys her life!”

As the standoff continued, Elder Kyle wheezed warnings: “Don’t... believe... his lies...”

Locke smirked. “Ask Kyle about Amy’s mother’s death. His hands aren’t clean!”

Chaos erupted. Chief Allen trembled with rage, while Guanyu struggled to maintain order. Amid the uproar, Locke flung a powder that felled Amy, then fled with her.

Bikacat’s timely pounce sank fangs into Locke’s thigh, forcing him to drop his hostage. Guanyu caught Amy—now disfigured by swelling and necrotic hues.

“She’s poisoned,” confirmed Priestess Shaosiming.

“Locke carries the antidote,” Guanyu reasoned, restraining the enraged chief. “Let me hunt him. You stay with Amy.”

Pursuing the wounded Locke beyond Elvenwoods, Guanyu cornered him. The fugitive brandished a spatial ring: “Treasures for my freedom! Rare tomes! Pills!”

Guanyu feigned disinterest before snatching the ring. Suspending Locke midair with qi, he inspected the loot—a king’s ransom in cultivation resources.

“You thieving maggot!” Locke writhed. “I’ll kill you!”

Guanyu smirked. “Your execution begins now. Pray the antidote’s among your trinkets.”
