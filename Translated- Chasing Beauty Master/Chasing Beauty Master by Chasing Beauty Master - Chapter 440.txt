“Such words undoubtedly delivered a stinging slap to those present. Her friend sighed beside her, clearly realizing the once-renowned campus belle had truly fallen head over heels.

Liu Shilei’s close friend genuinely couldn’t fathom what made Guan Yu worthy of her affection.

At that moment, a woman’s shrill scream pierced the air. A bespectacled man rushed in frantically, shouting, “Brothers, come quick! A drunkard is harassing my girlfriend!”

Hearing this, the men at Guan Yu’s table immediately stood and strode out, casting pointed glances his way as they left.

Guan Yu, however, continued eating leisurely as if nothing had happened.

Someone snapped, “Guan Yu, are you even a man? Too scared to step up when there’s a fight?”

Guan Yu retorted coolly, “Why should I care about a stranger’s girlfriend? What’s that got to do with me?”

The woman choked on her words, muttering curses under her breath before storming out with her companions.

Liu Shilei’s friend hesitated. “Aren’t you going out, Shilei?”

Liu Shilei shook her head. “I’ll wait for Guan Yu.”

“Fine. I’m leaving.” Disappointed, her friend rose and departed.

Once Guan Yu finished eating, he wiped his mouth. “Let’s go, dear.”

“Look at you—food all over your face.” Liu Shilei chuckled, gently brushing a grain of rice from his lips.

Grinning, Guan Yu suddenly turned solemn. “Do you blame me?”

Understanding he meant his refusal to help earlier, she replied, “Why would I? You’re no charity worker. Helping or not is your choice.”

“Hah! You’re truly the best wife!”

He planted a loud kiss on her cheek and guided her outside. There, they found the man who’d cried for help sprawled on the ground, while Liu Shilei’s classmates surrounded a young man and a middle-aged man.

The youth, though handsome, bore a pallid complexion and roguish eyes that screamed “playboy.” He clutched a struggling woman, sneering, “What? Planning to gang up on me?”

A middle-aged man from Guan Yu’s table barked, “Listen here—I’m the general manager of Dachang Company. That’s my classmate you’re holding. Let her go, or face the consequences!” He glanced conspicuously toward the entrance where Liu Shilei stood watching, puffing his chest with pride.

Other men chimed in, boasting their titles and firms—less about rescuing the woman, more about flaunting status.

“Dachang Company? Never heard of it. Piss off, or I’ll make you regret it!” The drunk youth waved a bottle menacingly.

The hotel manager scurried over, bowing obsequiously. “Young Master Zhou! Forgive the oversight—had I known you’d arrived—”

“You! Perfect timing. Clear these rats out and book me a suite. This little beauty and I need… privacy.”

The manager whispered urgently to the group, “This is Young Master Zhou of the capital! His grandfather is Zhou Xiaochuan—you’ve seen him on TV. Walk away now if you value your careers.”

The name struck like thunder. Liu Shilei’s classmates recoiled, paling—anyone in business or politics knew Zhou Xiaochuan’s influence.

“Hahaha!” The Zhou heir kissed his captive’s cheek triumphantly. But spotting Liu Shilei in Guan Yu’s arms, he shoved the woman aside and swaggered over. “How about you keep me company tonight, gorgeous?”

The classmates exchanged looks—some worried, others gleeful—but none intervened. Grandstanding was easy; confronting the Zhou heir? Fool’s errand.

**Chapter 10100: A Slap in the Face**

“Apologize to my wife. Now.” Guan Yu’s voice dripped menace, his glare feral enough to startle Zhou.

Recovering, the youth spat, “Who the hell are you to threaten me? Don’t you know I’m—”

*SLAP!* Guan Yu’s palm cracked across his face. “You dare hit me?!”

*SLAP!* Another blow.

“You bas—”

*SLAP!*

“I’ll f—”

*SLAP!*

Each curse died under relentless strikes. The once-smug Zhou heir now sported a swollen, bleeding face, rendered nearly speechless.

A middle-aged man behind Zhou stepped forward. “Young man, do you realize whose grandson you’ve struck? Zhou Xiaochuan’s! The repercussions—”

“And you are?” Guan Yu’s gaze dropped to the man’s wrist, noting a half-hidden inverted cross tattoo.

“Who I am matters less than the grave mistake you’ve made!”

“Mistake? If Zhou Xiaochuan were here, he’d say I went too easy.”

At the Zhou estate earlier, Guan Yu had wondered how Zhou Xiaoyou was poisoned. Now, seeing Zhou Xiaofeng’s tie to this man, it clicked—likely, her own brother had drugged her. As for why? The fool probably didn’t realize he’d been played.

“Arrogant pup,” the man hissed, his aura unnervingly corpse-like.

Guan Yu smirked. “Arrogance requires capital. Leave now, or you won’t escape later.”

The man faltered under Guan Yu’s calm. “Why would I flee?”

Zhou Xiaofeng, phoning family, slurred, “Stay put if you’ve got guts!”

“Wouldn’t dream of leaving,” Guan Yu replied.

Liu Shilei’s classmates squirmed. They’d dismissed Guan Yu as a freeloader—yet here he was, defying the Zhou heir. Regret gnawed at those who’d snubbed him; others still doubted, certain he’d soon grovel before the Zhous.

Minutes later, Zhou Xiaochuan stormed in. Spotting Guan Yu, he startled before comprehension dawned. The onlookers braced for Guan Yu’s downfall—only to gape as Zhou greeted warmly, “Xiao Yu! What brings you here?”

*Xiao Yu? Since when does Zhou Xiaochuan know him?!*

“Your grandson demanded my girlfriend’s ‘company,’” Guan Yu said icily.

Zhou Xiaochuan trembled with rage. “You disgrace!” He whirled and *slapped* his grandson.

Zhou Xiaofeng staggered, clutching his bleeding mouth. “Grandpa, why?!”

“Apologize! Now!”

“He’s just that Guan Yu who took down the Songs! Why bow to him?!”

“APOLOGIZE!”

Threatened with military confinement, Zhou Xiaofeng growled, “Sorry. I was wrong.”

“Louder.” Guan Yu picked his ear.

“SORRY! I WAS WRONG!”

Guan Yu stood. “Remember—cleverness blinds. You’re being used as a pawn, endangering your family.”

“Screw your advice!”

Zhou Xiaochuan interjected, “Xiao Yu, should we have him examined?”

“He’s already poisoned.” Guan Yu turned to the middle-aged man. “Right?”

The man paled. “Nonsense!”

“Seize him!” Guan Yu ordered Zhou’s guards.

The man erupted, leaping unnaturally high to punch a guard across the room. As he fled, Guan Yu blurred into his path, activating gravity manipulation to slam him into a wall.

“H-How?!” the man gasped, horrified.

**Chapter 10101: The Mysterious Man**

Post-ruckus, Guan Yu interrogated the man at the Zhou estate.

“Name. And how’d you get that strength?”

The guards had suffered broken ribs from strikes no normal human could deliver. Even the man’s vertical leap defied physics.

“You’ll be punished,” the man sneered.

A Zhou family criminologist pressed, “Did you drug Miss Zhou?”

“Miss Zhou? She’s merely a cultivation vessel!”

Guan Yu stiffened. *Cultivation vessel?*

“Explain,” he demanded.

The man clamped up until Guan Yu forced a Heart-Devouring Worm down his throat. Agony contorted him as the creature writhed within, shackles biting flesh.

“What’s a cultivation vessel?!” Zhou Xiaochuan demanded.

Guan Yu’s face darkened. In ancient texts, “furnace cauldrons” were humans used to refine elixirs—or worse. But this…
