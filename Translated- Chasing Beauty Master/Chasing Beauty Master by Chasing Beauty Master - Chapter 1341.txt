Xi Liu sighed helplessly, “Young Mistress Rong’er, you wouldn’t understand. Our Strange Demon Cave differs from your Demonic Soul Sect. You can flaunt your beauty and power without fear, for your sect has wealth and influence. But we cannot afford such luxury. We must still develop here, and this young master…we dare not offend him. Please grant me this face and spare him.”

Wang Xiaorong nodded breezily. Having suffered no real loss, she saw no issue in compliance. Yet after momentary reflection, she added, “Sister Liu, I’ll absolutely honor your request. But mark this – you now owe me a favor.”

Xi Liu gave a bitter chuckle and shook her head. She’d known today’s matters wouldn’t conclude simply.

“I’ll let him go unpunished today,” Wang continued, “but you must return with me to meet Father. His joy at seeing you would be immeasurable.”

Guan Yu vaguely grasped their circumstances. Xi Liu clearly wished to avoid Demonic Soul Sect’s attention after prolonged concealment. Her presence being discovered by Wang Xiaorong now jeopardized Echo Pavilion’s secrecy – an unfavorable development for Strange Demon Cave before establishing foothold in Treasure Mountain region.

If Wang spared Young Master Qin today, the debt would inevitably draw Demon Lord’s summons. Cooperation with Demonic Soul Sect would prevent their annexation but force Strange Demon Cave’s relocation. Conversely, allowing harm to Qin – whose family commanded immense prestige and wealth in Qujiang City, even intimidating the magistrate – would doom Echo Pavilion’s operations.

Trapped between dilemmas, Xi Liu stood paralyzed.

“Why torment yourself, Sister Liu?” Wang pressed. “Father’s decades-long search aims only for demonic unity. Align with Demonic Soul Sect and abandon these hardships! Your people could thrive within our ranks, free from daily struggles.”

Though reasonable and tempting, Xi Liu knew the Demoness Sisters harbored ambitions mirroring other Four Lords – aspirations to unify the demonic path under their rule. True glory lay in sovereignty, not subjugation.

Chapter 3,465: Conversation Upstairs

Yet achieving this proved monumental. Their cultivation arts required immense mental discipline ill-suited to most women, hampering disciples’ progress. Worse, the techniques couldn’t be adapted for male practitioners, forcing exclusive recruitment of female disciples – their eternal predicament.

After lengthy contemplation, Xi Liu instructed Xiaobao: “Take the young master home. This matter no longer concerns you.”

“But Sister Liu, I didn’t know—”

“Enough. No blame falls on you.” Xi Liu waved off further explanation. “Escort him away.”

Post-departure, Xi Liu proposed: “Young Master Guan, Mistress Rong’er, let us converse upstairs.”

In an elegant chamber, Cui Hua served tea and wine until Wang, noticing the maid’s lovestruck glances at Guan Yu, snapped: “Little Cui Hua, you may leave. We require no service here.”

The maid hesitated, looking to Xi Liu for confirmation. At her nod, Cui Hua departed reluctantly. Wang rounded on Guan Yu: “You claim one visit earned such devotion? Preposterous!”

“Believe what you will,” Guan Yu retorted. “If irrelevant here, I’ll take my leave.”

“Scampering after that wench already?” Wang blocked his path. “How impatient!”

“This concerns demonic affairs – what use is my presence?”

“Young Master Guan speaks true,” Xi Liu interjected. “He only assisted with Young Master Men’s issue previously. For that, I remain grateful.”

“Hear that? Your suspicions shame a gentleman!” Guan Yu made to exit.

“Very well, I apologize!” Wang relented. “Stay, please.”

Though curious about demonic strategies, Guan Yu demurred: “As Yunqing Sect disciple, how can I consort with demons? Surely Madam Xi prefers orthodox absence.”

“What?!” Xi Liu sprang up. “Yunqing Sect?!”

“Precisely – sworn enemies. Should I remain?”

Conventional wisdom demanded eliminating orthodox spies, yet Guan Yu’s displayed prowess gave pause. Though Strange Demon Cave avoided wicked deeds, orthodox sects still deemed them heretics deserving death.

Baffled, Xi Liu turned to Wang: “Why accompany Yunqing disciple? Does Demon Lord condone this?”

“I snuck out!” Wang admitted. “Father wants Guan Yu as guest, but I intercept to spare his life.”

Xi Liu’s curiosity deepened. “Inviting a junior disciple? Unusual for Demon Lord’s methods.”

“You’re unaware?” Wang revealed. “Guan Yu masters both demonic and orthodox arts! Father offers any terms for his allegiance, yet he refuses.”

“Dual cultivation?!” Xi Liu paled, finally comprehending Guan Yu’s supernatural speed earlier. “A millennial prodigy! Forgive my earlier ignorance, Young Master. Your future greatness is assured.”

Guan Yu acknowledged the praise. Despite sect rivalries, he respected Xi Liu’s maternal care for disciples. “Your dedication to followers is admirable, Madam. Though our paths differ, your compassion transcends boundaries.”

“We share sisterhood, not hierarchy,” Xi Liu replied. “War-weariness drives our search for peaceful haven. Yet fate conspires against tranquility.”

Wang renewed efforts: “Why resist unity, Sister? As Four Blood Demon Monarchs, your alliance could—”

“Even if I yielded,” Xi Liu interrupted, “my disciples would reject subservience. Moreover, we’d become sacrificial pawns in your father’s games. Should he obtain Eight-Sided Drum Art, would he share it? We’d gain nothing.”

Admitting defeat, Wang sighed: “I’ll keep your secret. But Echo Pavilion’s days are numbered. Others will detect anomalies as I did.”

“We endure day by day,” Xi Liu said resignedly. “Destiny guides us.”

Guan Yu interjected: “If Wang keeps silence, what threat remains?”

“Underestimate Demonic Soul Sect at your peril,” Wang countered. “The Left Envoy frequents Qujiang City. How long before he discovers you?”

Xi Liu concurred grimly. Changing tack, she offered: “Stay for supper, both of you. Let me host properly.”

As Guan Yu declined, Wang threatened: “Dare leave and I’ll haunt you like shadow – even to Yunqing’s gates!”

Chapter 3,467: Persuasion (Conclusion)

Guan Yu paled at the粘人specter, reluctantly resuming his seat.

“Knew you’d stay,” Wang trilled victoriously.

Xi Liu smiled faintly at the familiar dynamic. Guan Yu fumed silently, weighing risks of association against this human barnacle’s persistence. Orthodox factions’ potential backlash loomed large, yet curiosity anchored him.

The trio’s fateful dialogue continued, their intertwined destinies echoing through the chamber’s ornate walls as night deepened over Qujiang City.
