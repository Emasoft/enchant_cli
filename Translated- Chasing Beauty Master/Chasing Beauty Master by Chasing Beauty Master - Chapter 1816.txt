Chapter 4752: Going Back on One's Word

With sufficient motivation driving participation, we wouldn’t need the sect masters to assign tasks through tedious deliberations—disciples would actively volunteer themselves.

Tasks would be approached earnestly for promised rewards. Though dangerous missions require voluntary acceptance, this system would alleviate collective tension.

The difficulty of tasks would correspond to their rewards, ensuring enthusiastic competition among disciples. Gone would be the days of struggling to find participants.

Previously, completing missions only granted experience and minor cultivation progress without tangible rewards, while failures incurred punishments. Naturally, no one wanted to undertake them.

Implementing a reward system would not only ease task assignments but also invigorate Yunqing Sect’s atmosphere.

Xuan Ming acknowledged the plan’s merits but voiced concerns: “While this sounds reasonable, our sect has countless tasks requiring disciples’ efforts. Where would we find enough resources to reward them all?”

“Master,” Guan Yu retorted, “why feign poverty with me? Who’d believe a millennia-old sect like Yunqing lacks foundational treasures?”

Chastened, Xuan Ming flushed. He realized being overly frugal with disciples was misguided—each peak’s master could contribute rewards to motivate disciples.

An idea struck him. “Guan Yu, retrieve the Eight-Drum Technique from the capital this time. I’ll combine your rewards for this and the crossbow project afterward.”

“Master, that’s hardly fair!” Guan Yu protested. “Each deed deserves its own reward. By your logic, could I postpone punishment for breaking rules until my next offense?”

Immediate rewards were crucial for maintaining disciples’ trust and motivation. Deferring compensation would breed disillusionment.

Moreover, a reward system would highlight individual strengths, allowing outstanding disciples to distinguish themselves through achievements. Over time, distinctions would emerge—frequent contributors might earn magical artifacts beyond standard Yunqing swords.

This system would strengthen the sect by investing resources in loyal disciples rather than outsiders.

Cornered by Guan Yu’s relentless logic, Xuan Ming offered: “What if I grant you some White Mystic Steel?”

“That was already promised!” Guan Yu countered. “My crossbow innovation benefited the entire sect—even Grandmaster Jiu praised it as groundbreaking. Will you dismiss my contribution with mere words?”

Xuan Ming deflected: “I’ve long regretted failing to obtain the Eight-Drum Technique in Miao City...”

“That mission wasn’t my failure!” Guan Yu interjected. “No one found it because the technique never existed there. How can I be blamed for false intelligence?”

“As for the capital mission,” he pressed, “if you’ll punish me for failing to retrieve the technique despite uncertain authenticity, I refuse to go.”

Xuan Ming conceded reluctantly: “The Miao City incident was unforeseen. This capital lead seems credible...”

“Since becoming your disciple,” Guan Yu declared, “I’ve prioritized Yunqing’s interests above all. While I can’t guarantee retrieving the technique, I’ll ensure no rival sect claims it.”

Truthfully, Guan Yu doubted the capital rumor’s validity. Public emergence of the technique would complicate covert retrieval. Matters required on-site assessment—speculation was premature.

Though aware the lead might be false, neither Yunqing nor rival sects would ignore it. Even false clues might reveal subsequent leads. As Xuan Ming insisted—they must prevent others from obtaining the technique.

Having extracted a concession, Xuan Ming strode forward grimly. “Choose one additional treasure as reward. Let none say I’m stingy.”

Guan Yu’s triumph faded upon inspecting the displayed items. “Master, your longevity is impressive, but no one would dispute your frugality! These are worthless trinkets—the best is a mid-grade artifact!”

Xuan Ming reddened, chuckling awkwardly. “How did you notice? Are you a mind-reading parasite?”

Guan Yu recalled a coveted item missing from the selection—proof of Xuan Ming’s deception. “Your standing in my esteem has fallen. This lacks integrity.”

Only Guan Yu dared such bluntness—others would’ve been expelled.

“Did you snoop through my treasures?” Xuan Ming demanded suspiciously.

“Display all your valuables!” Guan Yu challenged. “I won’t covet supreme relics like Dragon’s Eye Amber—just show basic fairness!”

Cornered, Xuan Ming waved again. A new tier of treasures materialized—high-grade artifacts gleaming brilliantly. Guan Yu immediately seized a white soft armor.

Xuan Ming’s expression soured. “The Icy Silk Counter-Injury Armor? Bandit! This is my most precious artifact!”

Guan Yu inspected the flexible armor. “At best, a superior high-grade artifact—hardly comparable to immortal-tier treasures like that bell-shaped relic.”

“Your discernment astounds me,” Xuan Ming sighed, defeated. The armor automatically adjusted to its wearer’s size and offered dual protection—absorbing attacks while reflecting partial damage back.

Forged by immortal hands through alchemical fusion of ten-thousand-year ice lotus and supreme gemstone, its cold silk threads neutralized attacks while amplifying the wearer’s strength.

Though deemed a failure by its creator for not reaching immortal-grade, it remained Yunqing’s treasure—Xuan Ming’s constant companion through decades of battles until peace rendered it obsolete.

“Why keep such ‘failed’ marvels hidden?” Guan Yu marveled, claiming his prize. To cultivators, this was a dream artifact—to immortals, mere discarded trial.

As Guan Yu stored his reward, Xuan Ming hurriedly recalled other treasures, mourning the loss of his mentor’s gifted heirloom. The cycle of mutual exploitation between master and disciple continued—a dance as ancient as cultivation itself.
