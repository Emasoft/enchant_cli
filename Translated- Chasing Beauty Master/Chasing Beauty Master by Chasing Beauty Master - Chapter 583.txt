After speaking, Guan Xiao didn’t wait for Guan Yu to protest before thrusting the Mysterious Iron Sword into his arms. The moment the weapon landed in Guan Yu’s embrace, its immense weight forced him to buckle forward, nearly crashing into Guan Xiao’s chest. Guan Xiao watched with an amused smile, causing Guan Yu’s face to flush crimson. Though he’d boasted daily about venturing out for trials, here he was, nearly flattened by a single sword—a blow to his pride! With only one thought screaming in his mind—escape—Guan Yu offered an awkward grin before darting out of the room like a gust of wind.

Outside, Guan Yu exhaled heavily. “That was beyond humiliating! I must never act so recklessly again. Lesson learned—next time, I’ll be cautious, or I’ll pay the price alone!” He shuddered, recalling how he’d been entranced by the Frostblade Sword’s appearance, only to be frozen solid.

“With this sword, surely I can split the Body-Refining Serpentflower’s roots? It’s forged from legendary Mysterious Iron, after all.” Anticipation bloomed across his face at the thought of uncovering the secrets within the plant’s roots. Clutching the heavy blade, he sprinted to his room. Inside, he eagerly retrieved the serpentflower, placed it on the floor, and unsheathed the sword.

*Clang!* The blade slid free, its radiance momentarily blinding Guan Yu and flooding the room with light. “Incredible!” he marveled. “Even the sword’s gleam is breathtaking! Father must truly approve of me now, ha!”

He raised the sword and struck the serpentflower. *Thud!* The floor beneath him cracked, yet the plant remained unscathed. Stunned, Guan Yu gaped. “How? The Mysterious Iron Sword couldn’t even scratch it? What could lie within these roots?” His curiosity ignited like wildfire. “I refuse to believe this!” he growled. “I’ll split you open today if it’s the last thing I do!”

Summoning all his strength, he roared, “BREAK!” and swung again. A shrill *shriek* pierced the air the moment his cry faded.

**Chapter 1476: Desiccated Corpse**

The peerlessly sharp Mysterious Iron Sword shattered in Guan Yu’s hands, its upper half vanishing. Before he could process this, a whistling sound made him whirl—only to see the missing blade fragment hurtling toward his face!

Instinctively, Guan Yu chanted a Body-Tempering mantra. His skin petrified, turning slate-gray as he crossed his arms defensively. *Boom!* The impact sent him flying backward, crashing into the wall before rebounding to the serpentflower’s side.

The gray sheen faded as Guan Yu collapsed motionless, his body wracked with agony. Had he not reacted swiftly, that strike would have killed him—a testament to the reflexes honed through recent trials. Minutes passed before he stirred, attempting to rise, but searing pain from his palms nearly knocked him unconscious again.

Gritting his teeth, he examined his hands: the sword fragment had pierced clean through both palms, blood dripping along the embedded metal. “Cursed luck!” he spat. “No treasure, nearly lost my life!” The memory of the blade nearly skewering his skull chilled him. “What horrors lurk in these roots to repel Mysterious Iron and shatter it? Whatever’s inside must be extraordinary!”

Despite his brush with death, curiosity overpowered fear. Guan Yu wrenched the blade free without a sound, his gaze burning toward the unmarked serpentflower. “I’ll find a way. I *will* see what’s inside.” Clutching the plant, he hissed through gritted teeth, “Time to visit Father again.”

As he pondered, his blood dripped onto the serpentflower’s roots—unnoticed, the dried stains and fresh droplets began seeping into the plant.

Over the following days, tribesmen under Guan Yu’s guidance mastered archery, their hunting yields soon surpassing rival groups. The tribe’s newfound respect for him drew the witch’s ire. She conspired with traitors to threaten his maidens, poisoning one to steal a strand of his hair while investigating his origins.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu’s growing influence fueled his passion for livestock breeding—a skill from his rural roots. Yet as he prepared to seek his father’s aid, the serpentflower’s roots glowed faintly, unnoticed. At the threshold, his blood transformed into crimson threads swirling into the plant, its radiance intensifying.

Panicked, Guan Yu tried flinging the flower away, but it clung like a leech. Dizziness overwhelmed him; his vision blurred as vitality drained away. Rage and despair flooded his mind—*So many unfinished dreams…to die like this?* Collapsing, his last thought echoed: *This…is the end.*

*Thud.* Guan Yu’s body hit the floor, skin graying, flesh withering. Within moments, a fresh desiccation lay where he fell.

**Chapter 1477: Deterrence**

As Jamseth collapsed, Elder Soro, the adjudicator, intoned, “Challenge failed. Jamseth loses.” His approving nod toward Guan Yu spoke volumes.

The defeated youth stared bitterly at the crowd’s new favorite. *What monster is he? A laughingstock fortnight ago, now the sect’s brightest star? Why must I witness this?* Limping over, Jamseth muttered, “You’ve won, Brother Guan.”

Guan Yu smiled faintly, scanning the once-defiant disciples now cowed into silence. “Where are the challengers now?”

The bullies shrank back, their bravado evaporated. Guan Yu dismissed them—their nature wouldn’t change.

“Brother Guan!” A melodic voice chimed. Huo Lingling gazed at him adoringly. “I always knew you’d shine beyond this place.”

He chuckled. “You foresaw me leaving?”

“Yes!” Her earnestness startled him. *Could she sense my latent power?*

Her whisper cut through: “Look how the girls stare.”

As Guan Yu’s last drop of essence vanished into the serpentflower, its roots blazed like daylight. The plant tore free, hovering above him before—*crack!*—exploding to reveal a jade-sized black orb veiled in ghostly cyan light.

A vortex of elemental energy swirled above Guan Yu, funneling into the orb until saturation. The maelstrom faded, replaced by a beam striking his brow. Milky light enveloped him, reviving desiccated flesh until he glowed anew.

The orb’s cyan aura dimmed, unveiling a heart-shaped crimson stone veined with pulsing threads. In a flash, it shot into Guan Yu’s chest. Fresh blood surged through his vessels, restoring his form.

Within his heart, the stone’s tendrils merged, etching crimson patterns. Lifeless muscles twitched—a thumb, then fingers—before Guan Yu bolted upright.

“The underworld…looks like my room?” He blinked. “Wait—I’m alive?” Examining robust hands, he gasped. “No blood loss? Even my skin hums with energy!”

**Chapter 1478: Ghostly Luminescence**

The cyan aura now engulfed Guan Yu’s heart, its glow clashing with the stone’s crimson veins until darkness prevailed. Beneath the shroud, twin hearts pulsed—one human, one miniature.

Guan Yu’s eyelids fluttered open.
