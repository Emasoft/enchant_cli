“Did you call me here today just to discuss this matter?”

The girl spread her hands in a gesture of helplessness. “I’ve even offered to throw myself at you and beg you to take me as your wife, yet you still refuse! At this rate, the favor I wanted to ask is clearly impossible!”

“Of course it’s impossible. As I’ve already said, sparing the Song family is out of the question. Unless…”

“Unless what?!”

“Unless Song Shaoqin comes to see me personally!”

The girl’s purpose today was indeed to plead for mercy on behalf of the Song family. Though her relationship with them was cordial, she wouldn’t normally intercede on their behalf. This time, she’d been persuaded by Song Jiadi.

Knowing their patriarch had resolved to leave, Song Shaoqin had uncharacteristically felt a pang of guilt and secretly sought the girl’s help in persuading Guan Yu. This was his indirect way of yielding.

But asking him to personally bow his head to Guan Yu? Impossible! He loathed Guan Yu to the marrow, wishing he could tear the man apart with his teeth. How could he ever humble himself before his nemesis?

“You know that’s impossible,” the girl said bitterly. “Guan Yu, can’t you truly spare them?”

Though she didn’t return Song Shaoqin’s romantic feelings, their childhood bond remained. He’d always treated her like a protective older brother. Watching the Song family’s ruin stirred reluctant pity in her heart.

“If our positions were reversed, do you think the Songs would spare me?” Guan Yu countered.

The girl paused. “No.”

The Song family’s ruthless reputation was well-earned—those who crossed them faced annihilation. Had Guan Yu lost this struggle, neither he nor anyone connected to him would have survived their vengeance.

“Then why should I show mercy? I’ve already been lenient by offering them this chance. If Song Shaoqin personally begs for forgiveness, perhaps I might soften.”

“Fine. I’ll relay your terms.”

Suddenly, the girl’s demeanor brightened mischievously. “Now, let’s discuss our own affairs!”

“What affairs?” Guan Yu glared.

“I want to be your wife!”

“I don’t need one.”

“But I’m carrying your child!”

Guan Yu nearly stumbled. “What nonsense! We’ve never even—”

Fluttering her lashes, she teased, “If I announce my pregnancy and name you the father, who do you think the public will believe? The notorious playboy… or me?”

The outcome was obvious. Guan Yu’s multiple marriages were common knowledge in the capital. Even his wives like Wen Qing would likely believe the rumor—they knew his lustful nature all too well.

“Don’t you dare ruin me!” Guan Yu paled. If Wen Qing’s circle heard this, they’d skin him alive—especially since none of them had yet conceived.

“Keep me quiet by dating me,” the girl declared triumphantly.

“Mu Xiyan, are you insane?!” Guan Yu exploded. “However charming I may be, who begs others to court them?!”

He still seethed over how she’d provoked Wen Qing’s jealousy at the Imperial Academy, nearly wrecking his domestic peace. Now she threatened worse turmoil.

“I’m a great beauty!” Mu Xiyan retorted. “Shouldn’t you feel honored?”

“Honored? No. Find another fool—I’ve no time for games.” He stood to leave.

“Walk away, and I’ll scream that you abandoned your pregnant lover!” She grinned, inhaling dramatically. Guan Yu clamped a hand over her mouth.

“Shout, and I’ll teach you a lesson!”

Prying his hand away, she simpered, “What kind of lesson?”

Seeing her impish smirk, Guan Yu snapped. Seizing her head, he crushed his lips against hers.

Mu Xiyan froze, shocked by the public assault. She pushed weakly, but Guan Yu only deepened the kiss—a crude retaliation against her antics. Gradually, her resistance melted. Arms snaking around his neck, she matched his fervor as cafe patrons tittered around them.

When they finally parted, Guan Yu smirked at her flushed face and swollen lips. “Slander me again about pregnancies, and I’ll repeat this ‘lesson’!”

Eyes downcast, she whispered, “Does this mean we’re courting?”

“Hardly.” He shrugged. “I took advantage—nothing more.”

Mu Xiyan’s temper flared. “Then why kiss me?!”

“Why not? If you’re bearing my child, a kiss seems fitting.” His smug tone stoked her fury.

“That was a lie! You had no right!”

“You didn’t resist.”

“I don’t care! You must take responsibility!”

“Or what?” Guan Yu sneered.

She brandished her phone. “Refuse, and I’ll post these kissing photos online. All Beijing will see your ‘innocence’ then!”

The minx had secretly photographed their embrace.

“Damn you!”

“Your choice, ‘husband.’” Her triumphant grin reminded Guan Yu of a tyrannical matriarch bullying a hapless scholar—except here, the roles were cruelly reversed.

“Fine! I agree!” He surrendered, consoling himself that her beauty and status made this no loss.

Satisfied, Mu Xiyan pecked his cheek. “I’ll relay your message to Song Shaoqin. Visit me soon!”

As she left, Guan Yu touched the lingering warmth, chuckling at her audacity.

“Young Master, your call.” Tang Xiao approached with a phone. Cao Xiping’s update prompted Guan Yu’s order: “Keep it quiet until my signal.”

After hanging up, Tang Xiao asked, “Our next move?”

“Wait.”

...

In the Song manor’s rear chamber, Song Shaoqin roared upon hearing Mu Xiyan’s report. “Beg him?! That upstart dares demand this?!”

As predicted, his pride revolted against submission.

“My task is done.” Mu Xiyan sighed inwardly. The once-proud scion’s fall epitomized life’s fickleness.

After a strained silence, Song Shaoqin pleaded, “Advise me, Xiyan. How can I save my family?”

“Shaoqin,” she said gently, “complete survival is impossible. Swallowing your pride is the only way to keep the Songs on the mainland.”

“But to grovel before that wretch…”

“The authorities don’t intend to destroy you entirely.” Her meaningful pause referenced her uncle’s high connections. “The decision is yours.”

Her departure left Song Shaoqin grappling with hope. If the government showed leniency… Could he endure this humiliation?

...

Nightfall found Guan Yu’s coalition—the Dongs, Jiang Ziji, Wang Dahu—finalizing strategies.

“Three more days should end this,” Wang Dahu grinned. His family’s heavy investment was nearing payoff, silencing critics of his leadership.

“What’s your thought, Xiaoyu?” Elder Dong asked the silent strategist.

“When will Song Shaoqin arrive?” Guan Yu checked his watch. Four hours since Mu Xiyan left—the prey should be nearing the trap.

As others exchanged puzzled looks, a guard announced Song Shaoqin’s arrival.

“Let him wait through our dinner,” Guan Yu ordered, savoring the power shift.

Thirty minutes later, the defeated heir was ushered in.

“You’ve outdone yourself,” Song Shaoqin spat.

Ignoring the venom, Guan Yu lounged. “If you’re here to praise me, save it. I’m overstocked on flattery.”

Wang Dahu stifled a laugh at the brazen arrogance.

“Spare my family,” Song Shaoqin ground out.

“A plea? Or demand?”

“I’m… asking.” The honorific ‘Young Master Guan’ choked him.

“Why should I comply?”

“Show mercy while you can!” Song Shaoqin’s eyes blazed. “Given any respite, we’ll return stronger!”

Guan Yu laughed. “Still deluded? I know about your asset transfers and stock dumps. Should I inform the regulators… or the State Council?”

Song Shaoqin staggered. “How?!”

“Irrelevant. Prepare for shareholder lawsuits and government seizures.”

The threat of exposed financial crimes—enough to freeze all Song assets and attract state intervention—left the heir trembling. Guan Yu’s cyberhound Cao Xiping had unearthed every clandestine move.

...

**Chapter 1094: Song Shaoqin’s Submission**

The coalition finally grasped Guan Yu’s earlier confidence—every contingency had been anticipated.

As midnight approached, Guan Yu’s prediction materialized. Pride and legacy warred within Song Shaoqin, but survival demanded surrender. The predator awaited his prey’s final grovel—a reckoning years in the making.
