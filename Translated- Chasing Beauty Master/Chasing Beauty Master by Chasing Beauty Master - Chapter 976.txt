Guan Yu watched the scene before him, powerless to intervene. He had no desire to provoke a giant serpent, let alone risk angering its master. The person swallowed by the snake was beyond saving.

Across the street, a plump woman emerged from a small cargo truck. Despite her hefty frame, she darted forward with surprising agility, closing the distance to the serpent in a series of swift movements. Just as Gu A’nu was about to shout a warning, the woman affectionately stroked the snake’s raised head, her smile unflinching.

Guan Yu suddenly recalled Old Master Yang’s accounts of Ying Shangu (Camp Mountain Aunt). This woman must be her—the one who had unleashed the serpent.

To release a man-eating snake in broad daylight was brazen lawlessness. Though Guan Yu wished to act, he knew his limits. Xue Jing, trailing behind him, had gone rigid with terror at the sight of the creature, rendering her useless in a fight.

Nearby, a Tibetan Mastiff barked furiously at the serpent, but the snake seemed satiated, its midsection bulging grotesquely from its recent meal. The crowd of onlookers had long since scattered, fleeing the threat of becoming the next victim.

Ying Shangu frowned at the mastiff’s noise. With a flick of her wrist, a sliver of white light shot into the animal’s open mouth. The mastiff choked as if gagged by a stone, then began spinning wildly, emitting guttural whimpers before collapsing dead within moments.

Guan Yu shuddered at her ruthlessness. As police sirens wailed in the distance, Ying Shangu twirled her wrist in a cryptic gesture. The serpent obediently retreated into the cargo truck.

Though tempted to let the authorities handle the aftermath, Guan Yu knew better than to meddle. Ying Shangu was not one to cross lightly. As he turned to leave, she materialized before him with unnerving speed. *She could’ve killed me already,* he realized, cold sweat prickling his neck.

“You’re Guan Yu, yes?” Ying Shangu appraised him, her rolls of flesh quivering with each exaggerated sway.

He stiffened. They’d never met—how did she know his name?

“Don’t fret,” she purred. “I’ve heard you possess a fragment of a treasure map. I merely wish to… *borrow* it.” Her eyes raked over him. “Such a handsome young man. No wonder you keep so many women around.”

Guan Yu’s pulse quickened. *She’s been investigating me.* Outwardly, he smirked. “Normally I’d oblige, but your reputation precedes you. What assurance do I have you’ll return it?”

“Ignore the rumors,” she simpered, batting her lashes. “I’m quite reasonable.”

“True,” Guan Yu drawled. “You don’t seem the ‘murderous toilet maggot’ they describe.”

Her smile froze momentarily before reforging into sweetness. “Jealous tongues wag. Now, the map?”

“It’s hidden in the northern woods. Too dark to retrieve tonight. Tomorrow, perhaps?”

“Now.” Her voice turned flinty.

Feigning resignation, Guan Yu agreed. As they prepared to leave, she pressed a hairy black spider into his palm. “No tricks,” she warned.

He shuddered convincingly. “Wouldn’t dare.”

At the crime scene, police found only the mastiff’s desiccated corpse—flesh devoured by parasites, leaving a hollowed husk crawling with maggots. Guan Yu watched in grim fascination as officers surrounded Ying Shangu’s truck.

The serpent erupted in a frenzy when provoked, but tranquilizer darts soon subdued it. Guan Yu noted Ying Shangu’s calculating gaze from beyond the police cordon. *She’s sacrificing the snake,* he realized.

Returning to his car, Guan Yu briefed Xue Jing. “Ying Shangu follows. We’ll lead her to the woods. Stay here—I’ll handle this.”

As they drove north, a black van tailed them discreetly. The remote forest path revealed no witnesses beyond rustling poplars. At a gnarled willow, Guan Yu pointed to a hollow four meters up.

Ying Shangu hoisted him effortlessly to the opening. Reaching inside, Guan Yu yelped and recoiled.

The confrontation hung suspended—a spider’s thread between survival and calamity.
