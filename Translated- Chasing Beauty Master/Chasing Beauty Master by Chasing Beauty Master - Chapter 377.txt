“Holy shit, I bet ten grand on that bastard! All his posturing just cost me my money!”

“Ten grand? I’m out a hundred thousand!”

“Damn it, if he’s not first, I’ll smash his car myself!”

“Relax—you’re not the only one who wants to wreck his ride.”

...

Amid the curses, Guan Yu’s car finally surged forward, like a gust of wind or a bolt of lightning, racing past.

The sheer speed sent skirts fluttering along the route, revealing a kaleidoscope of colorful and not-so-sexy underwear. Yet no one paid attention—all were stunned by the rocket-like velocity.

A flashy car for a flashy man!

The vehicle vanished into the night, but the crowd remained, waiting for the final champion’s return. Amid the debates over Guan Yu’s controversial reputation, Chang Qing’s bookmaking operation buzzed with renewed activity.

As Guan Yu sped to catch up, Wu Haojian and his two companions had already left him far behind. The trio communicated via a specialized radio system.

Zhao Xing, trailing at the rear, scoffed as he drove, “Arrogance has its price. Master Yu told us to keep an eye on him, but it’s pointless now—he’s lost!”

“Another victory for Brother Hao. How dull,” Wu Zijun chimed in, boredom lacing his voice.

“Let’s finish this and go home to our women!”

“Isn’t there another rich brat? Should we toy with him?” Wu Zijun’s voice crackled through Zhao Xing’s earpiece.

Yawning, Zhao Xing replied, “That guy’s driving a car way better than Brother Hao’s but slower than a snail. Why waste effort on trash?”

“True. Life’s so boring!”

Zhao Xing sighed dramatically, then froze as his rearview mirror flashed with blinding light. A speeding vehicle—Guan Yu’s multimillion-dollar supercar—blazed past him in an instant.

“Zijun! He’s caught up! Damn, he’s driving a freaking jet!”

“Good. Let’s give him a proper welcome,” Wu Zijun replied coolly.

Ahead, Wu Haojian led the trio, dominating the mountain pass.

“With cliffs all over this road, speeding like that’s suicide,” Zhao Xing sneered, flooring the accelerator. His car shot forward, pushing to its controllable limit—still far beyond the trailing rich kid, Wu Rui, who cursed, “Sons of bitches! Racing to your graves? I hope you all plunge off a cliff!”

Reluctantly, Wu Rui continued at a safer pace, leaving the contest to Guan Yu and the trio.

**Chapter 947: Life Hangs by a Thread**

“Zijun, see him yet?” Zhao Xing radioed, puzzled by Guan Yu’s absence.

“No. I slowed down to wait, but he’s nowhere. Maybe he crashed!”

“Ha! Thought he had guts, but he’s just a coward!”

“Or a corpse,” Wu Zijun chuckled darkly.

Hanging up, Zhao Xing focused on the treacherous road ahead. A sharp bend loomed—left a rock face, right a cliff. Confident, he maintained speed.

Suddenly, headlights blinded him. Another car materialized mid-turn. Swerving instinctively, Zhao Xing’s car skidded uncontrollably toward the cliff edge.

*Boom!* An explosion lit the night as his car plummeted, erupting in flames.

Guan Yu peered over the cliff, murmuring, “One down. Two to go.” A cold smile curled his lips. “Let’s see how much this hurts you.”

He drove off, targeting Wu Zijun next.

**Chapter 948: Ambush**

Wu Zijun, unaware of Zhao Xing’s fate, slowed to taunt Guan Yu. When radio silence greeted him, he tossed his headset aside. “Useless fool.”

Engine roars shattered the night. Wu Zijun’s eyes widened as Guan Yu’s car closed in rapidly. He accelerated, blocking the path.

Guan Yu rammed him. “You lunatic! Wrecking a million-dollar car?!” Wu Zijun spat, heart aching for the mangled machine.

Side by side, they clashed again, sparks flying. Ahead lay a deadly hairpin bend—Wu Zijun braked, expecting Guan Yu to yield. Instead, Guan Yu accelerated, executing a near-impossible drift, half his car hanging over the cliff.

“Madman!” Wu Zijun gaped as Guan Yu vanished ahead. “How?!”

Life had dangled by a thread—yet Guan Yu survived.
