“Father, I’m truly fine. Besides, it wasn’t dangerous at all—just a few pathetic soldiers. They didn’t even touch a hair on my head. It’s nowhere near as serious as you think.” Wang Xiaorong grew anxious upon hearing her father’s reproach and cursed inwardly, “This is all the Left Envoy’s fault, blabbering nonsense about everything!”

“That’s no excuse,” the Demon Lord of the Demonic Soul Sect retorted, his anger mounting. “You know well that we of the jianghu have always avoided entanglement with the imperial court. For years, we’ve lived by the principle that well water does not intrude on river water. Yet you? Within days of venturing out, you’ve stirred a feud with the authorities. And that Guan Yu—he actually killed a Minister Zhou! This is nothing but self-inflicted trouble!”

He paced, his voice sharpening. “It’s not that our Demonic Soul Sect fears those courtly weaklings, but why invite unnecessary strife? The so-called ‘righteous sects’ of the jianghu already plague us enough. I’ve no time to waste on Guan Yu’s recklessness. Do you understand?”

“It’s all lies!” Wang Xiaorong protested fervently. “Guan Yu never killed Minister Zhou! He’s never had direct dealings or grudges with the court. Someone framed him!”

“I care not whether he’s framed or wronged,” the Demon Lord snapped. “He’s now a wanted criminal—a fate he brought upon himself by provoking others. If he’s so innocent, why target him and not me?”

“In any case,” he continued coldly, “you are forbidden from seeing that Guan Yu again. What does he even possess? There are countless men superior to him. Why must you—”

“Father!” Wang Xiaorong interrupted, her voice trembling with defiance. “Do you truly distrust your daughter’s judgment? Guan Yu is unparalleled—not merely because he’s a Dual Cultivator of Demonic and Martial Arts, but as a person. His capabilities far exceed your imagination. Even with the imperial warrant, I believe he’ll resolve this effortlessly.”

The Demon Lord sighed, recognizing the futility of reasoning with her. His daughter was bewitched, trapped in Guan Yu’s shadow. After a weighted pause, he resolved: to spare her prolonged grief, Guan Yu must die. Though painful now, time would heal her wounds.

Noticing the telltale twitch of her father’s left eyebrow—a sign of murderous intent—Wang Xiaorong pleaded urgently, “Father, you cannot harm Guan Yu! He’s done you no wrong, nor has he harmed me. Why persecute him?”

“No wrong?” The Demon Lord’s eyes flashed. “As a disciple of the Yunqing Sect, he is my enemy. As a Dual Cultivator within their ranks, he is my greatest foe. I have ten thousand reasons to end him!”

“I forbid it!” Wang Xiaorong shouted. “You must not touch him!”

“Rong’er, why must you defy me?” The Demon Lord’s tone softened with feigned patience. “Eliminating Guan Yu benefits not only you but our entire sect. He is a latent threat. Should he mature into his power and turn against us, disaster will follow.”

“He would never attack the Demonic Soul Sect!”

“He serves the Yunqing Sect. If that old ghost Xuanming orders him, will he refuse?”

“I trust Guan Yu completely!” she insisted. “If he ever threatens us, I’ll die before his eyes to stop him! Have I not told you? Guan Yu doesn’t belong here. He’ll return to his homeland someday—perhaps soon. How could he become our enemy?”

“What if the unexpected occurs? If he grows powerful before we act, regret will come too late.”

“Impossible!” Wang Xiaorong countered. “His current skills are mediocre—he might not even defeat me. Why trouble yourself with such a fool?”

“A fool who’s a Dual Cultivator?” The Demon Lord scoffed. “Even a fool must be eradicated before he ceases to be one. We’ll sever this root of calamity.”

“Father…” Desperation crept into her voice before she shifted tactics, her tone icy. “Forgive my bluntness, but killing Guan Yu won’t be as simple as you think.”

“Preposterous!” The Demon Lord laughed derisively. “The Demonic Soul Sect dominates the jianghu. Crushing a mere Yunqing disciple is child’s play!”

Seizing an opportunity, Wang Xiaorong pressed, “Our sect’s might is undeniable, but sending hordes after one disciple would invite ridicule and provoke Yunqing’s retaliation. Surely you wouldn’t risk such disgrace?”

“True,” the Demon Lord conceded. “We’d never stoop to such embarrassment. Dispatching Guan Yu requires no grand force—it’s laughable to suggest otherwise.”

Smugly, he added, “Two envoys would suffice. If needed, the Left Envoy alone could handle it.”

“That won’t work,” Wang Xiaorong argued. “I don’t mean to slight our own, but Guan Yu… there’s an indescribable potency about him. Despite his unrefined skills, the Left Envoy might already be outmatched.”

After a contemplative silence, the Demon Lord nodded. “You’re right. Guan Yu has grown beyond his fledgling days. With the first layer of the Eight-Drum Technique now in his grasp, the Left Envoy alone may indeed fail.”

Meeting her gaze, he continued, “In direct combat, the Left Envoy holds the advantage. But if Guan Yu flees, interception becomes uncertain.”

**Chapter 3740: Nowhere to Go**

“However,” the Demon Lord smirked, “should both Left and Right Envoys strike together, Guan Yu’s survival is impossible. After decades of building the Demonic Soul Sect, allowing a Yunqing whelp to mock us would be unconscionable.”

“Father, have you no shame?” Wang Xiaorong feigned reproach. “The mighty Demon Lord, deploying two top envoys to kill a single disciple—is this a triumph to boast of?”

“Outcome supersedes method. By not acting personally, I’ve already spared Yunqing’s dignity.”

“I care not! Guan Yu is harmless—why obsess over him?”

“He dared entangle with my daughter. For that alone, he dies—regardless of other merits.”

Seeing his resolve, Wang Xiaorong pivoted. “Father, consider this: Guan Yu is a once-in-a-millennium genius, a Dual Cultivator. Imagine if I could sway him to our cause. Wouldn’t such power elevate the Demonic Soul Sect?”

Her words were a stalling tactic, banking on Guan Yu’s eventual departure. The Demon Lord, though skeptical, felt the lure of possibility. A Dual Cultivator’s allegiance could transform their sect’s fortunes.

“Can you truly persuade him?” he asked, tempering hope with wariness.

“Summon him here. As your daughter’s… companion, I deserve to interrogate him. Should he refuse…” The Demon Lord let the threat hang.

“He won’t come,” Wang Xiaorong sighed. “Guan Yu may seem simple, but he’s no fool. Why walk into certain death?”

“Enough!” The Demon Lord cut her off. “You’re confined here until the imperial matter settles. If you sneak out, I’ll hunt Guan Yu myself. Let’s test his famed evasion skills then.”

As Wang Xiaorong opened her mouth to protest, he raised a hand. “No more arguments. You’ll stay. And if Guan Yu refuses my summons, his fate is sealed.”

**Chapter 3741: Rescue**

At dawn, Xiao Zhi—who had scarcely slept—urged the Physician, “Let’s go. My friend’s injury can’t wait.”

Nodding, the Physician gathered his supplies. “The farmhouse beyond the bamboo grove? I know it. Lead the way.”

They hurried through the quiet morning. Entering the farmyard, Xiao Zhi froze. The old farmer lay dead in a pool of blood, his throat ravaged by three claw marks and a savage bite. The Physician examined the wounds. “No human did this. A beast, perhaps—yet no predators roam here.”

“Your wolf demon?” Xiao Zhi accused.

“Impossible,” the Physician said firmly. “Not all demons are malevolent. Accuse without proof again, and I’ll leave you to your suspicions.”

Rushing inside, they found the farmer’s wife similarly slain. No other bodies—or signs of struggle. “Your senior brother is skilled?” the Physician asked.

“Highly,” Xiao Zhi replied.

“Then likely he pursued the attacker or fled with your friend. Let’s search.”

Hours later, a white eagle answered the Physician’s whistle, soaring skyward to scout. Meanwhile, Xiao Qi—guided by multicolored butterflies—stumbled into a cavern. A humanoid beast lurked within, poised over an unconscious figure: Guan Yu.

As the creature turned on Xiao Qi, the butterflies swarmed to distract it. She fled, colliding with Xiao Zhi and the Physician at the entrance. The beast retreated into shadows upon their arrival.

They found Guan Yu alive but unconscious by the cavern wall. By nightfall, back at the bamboo house, the Physician tended to him. Xiao Zhi murmured gratitude, his earlier hostility thawed.

“Thank the butterflies,” Xiao Qi said modestly. “They led me.”

As Guan Yu stirred, Xiao Zhi leaned close. “You’re safe now. Rest.”
