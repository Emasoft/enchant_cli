Women have a particular sensitivity towards food—out of ten women, nine love to eat, and some desire to indulge but hold back. Yet, delicious food remains an irresistible temptation for them.

“Wonderful! So, Handsome Brother, you’ll treat me to lots of delicious things then, right?” Shuangshuang exclaimed excitedly.

“Of course. What I’ll treat you to, you’ve never tasted before, and I guarantee you’ll love it,” Guan Yu replied.

Women have a particular sensitivity towards food—out of ten women, nine love to eat, and some desire to indulge but hold back. Yet, delicious food remains an irresistible temptation for them.

“Wonderful! So, Handsome Brother, you’ll treat me to lots of delicious things then, right?” Shuangshuang exclaimed excitedly.

“Of course. What I’ll treat you to, you’ve never tasted before, and I guarantee you’ll love it,” Guan Yu replied.

Shuangshuang daydreamed blissfully about her future life in the city. With Handsome Brother there, she imagined savoring the finest delicacies and living in the most beautiful house.

As Guan Yu and Shuangshuang chatted in the courtyard, the girls inside the house emerged. The village head’s daughter stumbled out, her speech slurred. “Guan Yu, why are you standing outside? Everyone’s waiting for you.”

Guan Yu smiled helplessly. “I’m already full, and you’ve all had enough to drink. Let’s stop here—too much alcohol harms the body.”

The village head’s daughter swayed and collapsed into Guan Yu’s arms. He couldn’t let her fall, so he steadied her.

Shuangshuang, visibly annoyed, snapped, “Ugh, why did you drink so much? Get up! I’ll find someone to take you home.”

“I won’t go home! I want to stay with Guan Yu,” the village head’s daughter mumbled drunkenly. Guan Yu sighed. “She’s in this state—what do we do?”

Baijiu’s potency usually hits later, and by the time one realizes it, it’s too late. Shuangshuang said, “I’ll have someone escort her back. Handsome Brother, hold on a little longer.”

Guan Yu nodded. The village head’s daughter had downed at least half a kilogram of baijiu. When the full force struck, it would be overwhelming.

He also worried about his only set of clothes—tomorrow, he needed to drive Meimei for her wedding. If the village head’s daughter vomited on him, he’d be left with nothing to wear.

As the alcohol’s effects intensified, the village head’s daughter could barely keep her eyes open. Guan Yu gripped her shoulders to keep her upright.

The angle offered an unintended view, but with other girls nearby, Guan Yu restrained himself. Being caught would ruin his dignified image. Yet, he noticed her flushed face and neck, a rosy hue spreading downward.

How endearing, he thought, discreetly averting his gaze. Shuangshuang returned with her uncle. “Handsome Brother, let Third Uncle take her home.”

Guan Yu agreed. Third Uncle carried the village head’s daughter away. Watching them leave, Guan Yu felt an odd pang—like surrendering a succulent piece of meat to another man.

What thoughts might Third Uncle have, carrying a drunk girl? Would he take advantage en route? The notion flashed through Guan Yu’s mind but seemed too cynical to entertain.

After the village head’s daughter departed, the girls insisted on playing mahjong. But the Qu family’s busy schedule and limited sets left no room for Guan Yu’s group.

Once guests left, the Qu family finally sat down to eat. They urged Ling’er and Guan Yu to join. Aunt Qing, who hadn’t eaten yet, also joined.

Guan Yu declined. “I’ve already eaten.”

Shuangshuang tugged his arm. “Handsome Brother, you haven’t touched a bite! Come eat!”

“Guan Yu, don’t stand on ceremony here. Sit!” Auntie urged warmly.

Aunt Qing added, “We’re all family. Ling’er, sit with Guan Yu.”

Reluctantly, Guan Yu joined them. Aunt Qing praised, “Guan Yu has helped us so much. Meeting such a kind soul is a blessing.”

Uncle chimed in, “Guan Yu, let’s drink! You’ve done so much for us, even driving Meimei tomorrow. To your health!”

Shuangshuang, sitting happily beside Guan Yu, protested, “Dad, he’s already drunk enough!”

“Nonsense! He can handle more,” Uncle said, filling Guan Yu’s cup.

Meimei added, “We should thank Ling’er too! Guan Yu is her find. Ling’er, let me toast you with juice!”

Ling’er raised her drink. “No need. Guan Yu is naturally helpful.”

Auntie tearfully said, “Guan Yu’s medical skills cured my leg. I thought I’d never walk properly again.”

Uncle gratefully said, “Guan Yu, your generosity overwhelms us. To you!”

**Chapter Two Thousand Two Hundred Thirty-Five: A Flower Already Claimed**

Uncle, ever jovial, clinked glasses with Guan Yu. Everyone drank deeply.

Shuangshuang, blissful beside Guan Yu, whispered, “Thank you for my gift, Handsome Brother. Don’t forget our promise!”

“I won’t,” Guan Yu assured.

Shuangshuang giggled, blushing. Her parents exchanged puzzled glances—their daughter’s uncharacteristic meekness hinted at something.

Aunt Qing, aware of Guan Yu’s city life, wondered if Shuangshuang could fit into his world. Ling’er’s relationship with Guan Yu also intrigued them.

Auntie asked Ling’er, “How did you meet Guan Yu? Is he your boss?”

Ling’er explained, “We met at the hospital. Guan Yu defended me from unethical superiors. He later found me a job at a club, managing accounts. He even taught me computers.”

She glanced at Guan Yu. “I owe him so much. Thank you, Guan Yu.”

“Enough with the thanks,” Guan Yu said, half-teasing. Ling’er’s sweet tone made gratitude feel overwhelming.

Meimei asked pointedly, “Ling’er, who’s this ‘Madam’ you mentioned earlier?”

Shuangshuang’s chopsticks clattered to the floor. Aunt Qing fretted, “Shuangshuang, are you alright?”

Shuangshuang’s face fell. Her fairytale prince already had a girlfriend—Yang Conghan, heiress to the Yang family, foremost of the city’s Four Great Clans. Compared to such nobility, she was just a village girl.

“I’m full. I need air,” Shuangshuang muttered, leaving abruptly.

Guan Yu understood her heartache. Ling’er urged, “Go comfort her.”

Outside, Shuangshuang wept silently by the wall. Guan Yu approached softly. “Want to talk, Shuangshuang?”

She turned, burying her face in his chest. After soothing her, Guan Yu suggested, “Let’s chat in the car—privacy.”

Inside the car, soft music playing, Guan Yu said, “You’re young, Shuangshuang. Don’t trap yourself now.”

“But I’d give myself to you!” she declared, suddenly kissing him.

**Chapter Two Thousand Two Hundred Thirty-Six: Storytime**

Shuangshuang’s lips met his—a bold, heartfelt gesture. Guan Yu, surprised, reciprocated gently until her innocence melted into passion.

As their kiss deepened, a voice called outside: “Shuangshuang? Guan Yu? Where are you?”

Startled, Shuangshuang broke away, hastily adjusting her disheveled clothes. She lowered the window. “We’re here, Sister. Just talking.”

“Alright. Don’t stay out too late,” Meimei replied, unaware of their flushed states.

Guan Yu smoothed Shuangshuang’s hair, resisting the urge to devour her sweetness. She, meanwhile, savored the lingering thrill of her first kiss.

“Let me tell you a story,” Guan Yu said, reclining his seat. The night held more tales yet to unfold.
