This remark caused Jinhua and Qing Linger to widen their eyes simultaneously, staring at Guanyu with astonishment. Clearly, the two beauties had misunderstood his intentions.

Jinhua’s adorable little face puckered into a pout as she thought, *That stinky Guanyu! Isn’t having me alone enough? Do you really need three people to satisfy you…*

Linger’s thoughts were far more complicated. She wrestled with whether to stay or leave, her heart conflicted. The idea of a "three-person arrangement" for their first time made her profoundly uncomfortable. Her mind spiraled into chaos, and for some reason, she began imagining scenes from the night ahead. Instantly, her fair cheeks flushed crimson down to her neck.

Noticing their expressions, Guanyu realized his explanation had been lacking. “Don’t misunderstand!” he hurriedly clarified. “I didn’t mean what you’re thinking! There are plenty of rooms here—Linger can stay in any of them. Tomorrow morning, when I go out to buy breakfast for Jinhua, I’ll drop Linger off at work. Otherwise, if I take her home now, she’d just have to come back later. Wouldn’t that be troublesome?”

Despite his explanation, the women’s shocked expressions barely faded, replaced instead by faint disappointment. *Ah, a woman’s heart is as unfathomable as the ocean floor,* Guanyu sighed inwardly.

Jinhua pursed her lips petulantly. “No! All the other rooms haven’t been cleaned in ages. How could we let Linger stay there?”

Guanyu conceded the point. It seemed he’d have to send Linger home first before returning to play with Jinhua.

Meanwhile, Jinhua grew more resolute in her decision: she couldn’t easily acquiesce to Guanyu’s desires. She needed to keep him yearning.

“Linger will sleep in my room tonight,” Jinhua declared. Guanyu and Linger exchanged bewildered looks, utterly confused.

Guanyu’s heart leapt—could she actually be suggesting a threesome? His excitement quickly shattered when Jinhua added, “You’ll sleep on the sofa. If you dare sneak in while we’re asleep…” She brandished a tiny fist toward his crotch. “I’ll smash your balls to bits!”

Linger stifled giggles behind her hand while Guanyu protested indignantly, “What about the reward you promised me earlier? Are you backing out already?”

“I never said that,” Jinhua chirped. “Just not tonight. The reward wasn’t specified for this evening, was it?”

“Then when?” Guanyu pressed.

“That depends on my mood.” Dismissing him, Jinhua stood and tugged Linger toward her bedroom.

Left sulking on the sofa, Guanyu lamented his ruined night of anticipated bliss. As the women reached the bedroom door, Linger glanced back sympathetically. “Brother Guanyu, Jinhua’s condition has improved, but strenuous activity could worsen her injuries. For her health… you’ll have to endure it a while longer.”

Though her words offered little comfort, Guanyu clung to them. Jinhua added over her shoulder, “Don’t forget to take out the trash later,” before shutting the door.

Dejected, Guanyu noted how his four ghostly housemates remained engrossed in online games, ignoring him completely. Even his human companions had united against him. The world felt unbearably stifling.

Elsewhere, Yang Conghan felt a pang of resentment after Guanyu’s departure. Their rare meeting hadn’t even lasted the night. Yet she swallowed her pride—as someone “gifted” to Guanyu in exchange for favors, she had no right to complain.

Returning to the Yang family estate, she found her grandfather in his study. “You met Guanyu?” the old patriarch asked, chess piece hovering uncertainly.

“He searched my room,” Conghan replied, eyes fixed on the board. “I noticed something amiss after he left.” Her sharp mind had quickly deduced his purpose. A thorough inspection revealed an empty box beneath her bed—the very item Guanyu sought.

“He’s discovered Hanhan’s secret,” the grandfather mused. “And saved Jinhua after your father injured her.” The chess piece finally clicked onto the board. After prolonged silence, Conghan smiled. “Grandfather, you’ve lost.”

“Your skills improve daily,” the old man grudgingly admitted, though his competitive spirit made him triple-check the hopeless position. When Conghan inquired about handling Guanyu going forward, he sighed. “The Yangs rule this city, but we can’t oppose Huayu Group. If Guanyu exposes Zhang Han’s secret... the other three families will pounce. She’s our financial keystone.”

Conghan argued Guanyu would protect his beloved from danger. Relenting slightly, the patriarch agreed to clarify Guanyu’s stance later.

Meanwhile, the thwarted Guanyu sought solace at the Flower Night Club. Manager Hou Jinshun found him brooding in a corner. “Rare to see you here at night,” Hou remarked, setting down a bottle.

“Help me deal with Feng Jiawei,” Guanyu demanded bluntly. As they drank, the conversation turned to Linger’s recent promotion—Yang Conghan’s subtle bid for Guanyu’s favor through kindness to his women.

Their talk was interrupted by Feng Xihu’s dramatic entrance. Spotting Guanyu, she shouted, “Stop right there!” A chaotic chase ensued, ending with Guanyu tricking her into tailing a decoy car all night. When the exhausted Feng finally cornered the innocent driver at dawn, realization struck. Her enraged kick left the bewildered youth writhing in pain as she swore vengeance on the long-gone Guanyu.
