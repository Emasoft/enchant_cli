“Moreover, if things are as the other party said, this young man ordered such a lavish spread, which must have cost a considerable sum. Given his modest means, it’s only natural he’d be distressed about wasting it all.”

Guan Yu felt the young woman ought to show some understanding. After all, she knew the man’s circumstances were strained. To have gone to such lengths to impress her parents was already commendable.

“Why must you fuss so?” the woman retorted impatiently. “It’s just a table of food. If it’s wasted, so be it! You’re anxious? I’m even more so! Besides, this place was your choice—what does it have to do with me?”

“My choice?” the man shot back. “I only picked it to make a good impression on your parents! Who could possibly eat this much otherwise? Every tael of my silver was earned through hard work, not plucked from the streets! I went to all this trouble, yet your parents still haven’t shown up. What does that mean? Do they look down on me?”

Guan Yu sipped his wine, amused. Had he been their mutual friend, he might have tried mediating—but this quarrel was thorny. Neither side was wholly right nor wrong. The man’s frustration was justified: he’d invested heavily in this meeting to demonstrate his sincerity, only to face a no-show. The woman, equally vexed by her parents’ absence, masked her guilt with irritation.

If her parents arrived now, all would be resolved. But if not, the feast—and the man’s savings—would be squandered. The woman knew this too, aware of his devotion despite his poverty. Even she was growing restless. “I confirmed the time and reservation with them beforehand. Why aren’t they here?”

Her words, though muttered to herself, were meant for the man. Guan Yu, having drained his first jug of wine, signaled the inn attendant. “When do you close?”

“We remain open until midnight, sir,” the attendant replied with a bow. “Guests often return late. Please take your time.”

“Splendid. Bring another warmed jug,” Guan Yu said, settling in to observe the couple.

Hearing the inn would stay open until midnight, the pair hesitated. The man proposed, “Why not go fetch them yourself?”

“Alone in the dark?” The woman shuddered. “I’d rather wait.”

As tensions rose, the woman softened. “Once we’re married, it’s my choice, not theirs. Even if they disapprove, I’ll persuade them.” Her reassurance steadied the man, who embraced her, vowing, “I’ll prove myself worthy of you.”

Guan Yu noted their dynamic: the woman’s fiery spirit tempered by empathy, the man’s pride soothed by her resolve. Yet the uneaten feast gnawed at them. Estimating midnight approached, Guan Yu intervened. “Why let this go to waste? Sell it to me.”

The man balked at the generous payment, but the woman eagerly accepted. “Keep the silver,” Guan Yu insisted. “Attend to your affairs.”

As the couple hurried off, the woman thanked him—aware of his kindness. Guan Yu, left with cooled dishes and warmed wine, hoped his gesture might ease their path. The attendant muttered, “Such waste… enough to feed the poor for days.”
