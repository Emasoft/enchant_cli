“A pass?” Guan Yu inquired. “Very well, let me ask you this—when we moved His Highness from the inn earlier, only a few of us knew about it. Not even the two captains were informed. Yet the Embroidered Uniform Guard arrived and headed straight to the second inn. Clearly, someone leaked His Highness’s whereabouts.”

“As you said,” the other retorted, “I wasn’t the only one who knew about the relocation. How does that prove *I* betrayed us?”

“How cunning,” Guan Yu pressed. “But during that time, you were the only one who left. No one else stepped out. That means only *you* had the chance to inform them.”

“Slander!” Zou Wuxiao (No Resemblance) glared. “You accuse me without proof! You yourself knew of the relocation—it was your idea! I merely went to the privy. Does that make me a traitor?”

“Still stubborn to the end,” Guan Yu countered. “You’re right—perhaps *I* could be the traitor. The Eldest Lad, Second Maid, or even Zou Wuhui (No Regret) might also be suspects. But there’s one thing you didn’t know.” He leaned closer. “As a precaution, I secretly moved His Highness again—to here. You weren’t aware, were you? Only four knew: me, Xiao Rong, the Eldest Lad, and Second Maid. Not even Wuhui or you.

“Thus, the Embroidered Uniform Guard remained ignorant. The leak before could only have come from you or Wuhui. The traitor must be one of you.”

Zou Wuxiao paled. He hadn’t anticipated this twist. Now, even a hundred excuses wouldn’t save him. Returning had been a fatal miscalculation.

“Second Brother,” Zou Wuhui’s voice trembled, “you must explain. The evidence points only to you.”

**Chapter 4182: Incurable**

Though unwilling to believe it, Zou Wuhui knew logic left no escape. Zou Wuxiao hung his head in silence. With Wuhui’s loyalty unquestioned, the verdict was clear.

The others exchanged confused glances. They’d assumed His Highness was still at the prior inn. Even the captains guarding the empty rooms had been deceived.

“Wuxiao,” Lord Zou’s voice turned icy, “I never imagined such treachery from you. Since childhood, I’ve treated you as my own. Yet you commit this atrocity—you ungrateful wretch!”

“I thought you’d flee,” Guan Yu remarked. “Yet here you are, walking into your own trap. I saw through you the moment the Guard arrived.”

“Since you’ve uncovered everything,” Zou Wuxiao spat, “do as you will. I’ve nothing to say.”

“Why, Second Brother?” Zou Wuhui wept. “His Highness cherished us. Why betray him? Give me a reason!”

“I had no choice.” His voice hollowed. “His Highness forbade me drink, but you know I cannot live without it. One night, while sneaking out, I met a man. We bonded over wine… only to learn later he’d ensnared me. He infected me with Blood Toxin. Each month, I need his antidose—or I transform into a monster and die. He blackmailed me into betrayal. I never wanted this…”

Tears streamed down his face, softening the outrage. His plight—a pawn under coercion—muted the room’s fury.

“Blood Toxin?” Wang Xiaorong and Guan Yu exchanged glances. Guan Yu surmised the culprit: Yan Zhao, the sole Demon Soul Sect member nearby. Having suffered prior defeats, Yan Zhao must’ve exploited Wuxiao’s weakness.

“Second Brother,” Wuhui pleaded, “you should’ve sought help! Together, we’d have found a cure!”

“No cure exists,” Wuxiao whispered. “I did this… to survive.”

A bystander interjected, “Blood Toxin is unique to the Demon Soul Sect. Why target *you*?”

Guan Yu noted the man’s insight but stayed silent. The damage was done—betrayal demanded consequences.

Lord Zou turned to the wall, cold. “Wuhui. Execute him.”

“Mercy, Your Highness!” Wuhui begged. “He was coerced! Spare him!”

No others spoke. This was the lord’s kin; outsiders held no sway.

“Execute him!” Lord Zou repeated.

Weeping, Wuhui dropped her sword. “I cannot… I beg your leniency!”

When none moved, Lord Zou seized the blade himself. With a thrust, he pierced Wuxiao’s heart. The body crumpled silently.

Gaspes filled the room. Even in grief, Wuhui dared not protest. Blood pooled as Lord Zou murmured, “Third Captain… bury him honorably.”

His face shadowed with grief, the lord turned. “Wuhui, return to No-Sword Inn. Recruit reinforcements. The rest—disperse and rest.”

As the crowd retreated, Xiao Zhi muttered, “I’d never have believed Lord Zou could kill his own…”

“Traitors deserve no mercy,” Wang Jun stated. “Wuxiao always defied orders. Better dead than a lingering threat.”

Guan Yu nodded. “Were I Lord Zou, I’d have done the same. Blood ties matter not when betrayal strikes.”

“Yan Zhao must’ve planted the toxin,” Wang Xiaorong deduced.

“Likely,” Guan Yu agreed. “His presence in the Guard proves the Demon Soul Sect still hunts Lord Zou. This tarnishes your sect’s name.”

Xiaorong frowned. “Left Emissary assured me Yan Zhao was recalled. Why is he still here?”

“Perhaps your Left Emissary lied,” Guan Yu suggested. “Your sect took bribes—abandoning the contract lacks honor.”

Xiao Zhi sneered, “Honor? Demonic sects know none. They’d sell their mothers for profit!”

“Watch your tongue!” Xiaorong flared. “Your Cloud Azure Sect’s no better—hiding filth behind virtue!”

“Enough!” Guan Yu snapped. “Arguing solves nothing. Xiaorong, contact your Left Emissary. If Yan Zhao acts rogue, he risks making the Demon Soul Sect the realm’s enemy.”

She nodded. “I’ll demand Yan Zhao’s recall. His presence endangers us all.”

**Chapter 4183: Unbelievable**

Yan Zhao’s knowledge of their identities—and recognition of Xiao Zhi and Wang Jun—posed dire risks. Removing him was urgent.

Yet as tensions simmered, Lord Zou’s harsh lesson lingered: in a world of schemes and poison, mercy rarely survived the first betrayal.
