“When you were by my side, they couldn’t touch me. Now that I’ll be alone with the clever Ah Cai, they’ll be powerless against me. Even if I can’t defeat them outright, escaping won’t be an issue. You needn’t worry for my safety,” said Jinciyulang (Second Only to Wolf).

“That’s a relief…”

Guanyu responded absentmindedly. Yingzi lowered her head in silence. She had long known herself to be a burden to her brother, which drove her relentless cultivation—hoping to prove useful if enemies came, rather than remaining a perpetual source of worry for Jinciyulang.

Not long after, Yang Conghan called Guanyu to inform him of a flight back to Huaxia that very night. Upon hearing this, Yingzi suddenly felt the pang of parting from her brother.

“Yingzi, your happiness is mine. Rest assured—life in Huaxia will be no different from home. I’ll visit whenever time allows. Didn’t Guanyu say the gates of Qiaoyuan District will always welcome me?” Jinciyulang said softly, embracing his sister’s shoulders.

**Chapter 2419: A Troubled Heart**

Checking the time, Guanyu rose. “No time for dinner. We must head to the airport now. If you’re hungry, eat on the plane. Let’s go.”

After a brief nap, Lanyu awoke visibly calmer. Relieved, Guanyu noted that yesterday’s events hadn’t traumatized her—a critical reprieve for her future well-being.

Jinciyulang arranged a car to the airport. Yingzi wept in her brother’s arms, torn between reluctance to part and exhilaration at joining Guanyu’s life.

“This isn’t a farewell of life and death,” Guanyu chided gently. “Your brother can visit Huaxia whenever he wishes. No need for such sorrow.”

Yingzi’s conflicting emotions of joy and reluctance eased under Guanyu’s reassurance. “Indeed,” Jinciyulang added. “You should rejoice. After waiting so long, Guanyu has finally come for you.”

Wiping her tears, Yingzi smiled. “I know. I am happy… I just don’t know why parting hurts. But I trust you’ll defeat all those villains. You’re the legendary super-assassin of the Chuan Shuo—no one can best you!”

“Exactly. Now go with Guanyu. It’s time.”

With lingering glances, Yingzi followed Guanyu into the airport. The uneventful flight landed safely at 7 a.m. the next morning.

As Guanyu disembarked, Yang Conghan called. “Did you send a car?” he asked.

“I’ve waited over an hour. Delays are eternal. I’m at Exit 3,” she replied wearily. Guanyu sensed she’d likely waited all night.

Touched, he said, “We’re coming. Thank you.” Hanging up, he mused on Yang Conghan’s sincerity—yet wondered how she’d balance loyalty to her family against their bond.

Minutes later, Guanyu exited with Lanyu and Yingzi. From afar, Yang Conghan’s white luxury car gleamed.

Inside, Yang Conghan observed curiously: Lanyu clung to Guanyu’s arm—a familiar sight—but the unfamiliar girl on his right surveyed her surroundings with wide-eyed wonder.

A knot formed in Yang Conghan’s chest. *Did he really bring back another girl in one day?* Though she understood his unique circumstances, the sting of sharing his affection remained.

As they approached, Lanyu dashed ahead. “Sister Conghan! You’re so kind to fetch us!”

Guanyu gestured to Yingzi. “Get in.” The quiet girl nodded, sliding into the backseat while Guanyu took the front.

“Lanyu, why are you with them?” Yang Conghan asked.

“Pure coincidence! I meant to tour Woguo alone but met Guanyu at the airport. Fate, right?” Lanyu chirped, her cheer restored upon returning home.

“Quite.” Yang Conghan’s gaze lingered on the silent Yingzi. Unable to resist, she pressed, “Guanyu, who’s this? Did you charm a beauty in a day—right under Lanyu’s nose?”

Guanyu sighed. “Let me introduce: Yang Conghan, my girlfriend. Yingzi, my girlfriend.”

The awkward phrasing hung heavy. To deflect, he added, “We’re hungry. Let’s eat.” He produced the bank card she’d given him earlier.

“Fine. Explain on the way,” Yang Conghan said tersely, merging into traffic flanked by three black SUVs of bodyguards.

Guanyu steadied her. “I haven’t regained memories. Yingzi’s brother found me, aided me, and told me she’d waited all this time. I owed it to her. Destiny’s hand, Conghan.”

“But caution—”

“Unnecessary. Her brother had countless chances to harm me. Trust this.”

Yang Conghan relented. “I must prioritize your safety. Yingzi, no offense meant.”

“None taken. ‘Time reveals hearts,’ as your proverb says.”

Nodding, Yang Conghan warned Guanyu, “The others will chastise us both for acting rashly. You should’ve consulted us first.”

“With Xue Jing shadowing me daily? Yingzi waited years. I couldn’t delay.”

Yang Conghan’s lips thinned. *Lecherous excuses,* she thought, parking at a restaurant. After the meal, she drove them to Qiaoyuan District.

Xue Jing greeted them with stifled fury—held back by the crowd. “Sister Jing! I missed you!” Lanyu sang, hugging her.

As introductions circled, Amei brought fruit. “And this is…?”

Guanyu explained Yingzi’s ties to Ganbili (Dare to Compare) and Jinciyulang’s lifesaving aid. “She’ll stay here. Amei, prepare her room.”

Yingzi bowed repeatedly. “Please teach me cooking, Amei-jie. I’m dreadful at it.”

“Of course!” Amei flushed at the excessive politeness.

Meanwhile, Xue Jing and Yang Conghan conspired. “We must verify her background,” Yang Conghan urged.

“I’ll contact Jiejie (Elder Sister). Ganbili’s vouching helps, but caution stays.” Xue Jing headed upstairs, mind racing. *Another rival…*
