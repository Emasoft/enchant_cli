“You smell really nice…” Guan Yu grinned and teased in a low voice.

“You… hopeless jerk!” Mo Ling was once again defeated. Snorting through wrinkled nostrils, she stomped her foot fiercely before quickly chasing after Liu Shilei, her cheeks flushed crimson.

Mo Ling was nearly driven mad by Guan Yu! What kind of freshman was this? In this school, she was a teacher, and her students always feared her, especially when she lost her temper. Yet this scoundrel had the audacity to take liberties with her!

Watching the retreating figures of the two women ahead, Guan Yu felt somewhat dazed. Whoever married such beauties in the future would surely lead an endlessly joyful life. A stunning woman like Liu Shilei—any man who won her heart would likely cherish her like a precious treasure day and night.

Wait… she was his cousin’s wife. Raising an eyebrow and smirking, Guan Yu wasn’t sure how to feel—part of him envied his older cousin.

As for Mo Ling, this quirky little woman, only three or four years older than him, was already a university teacher, likely retained after graduation. Hmm, a bit domineering in temper, but an amusing young lady!

Following the two women out of the school gate, the street vendors outside were sparse, perhaps because classes wouldn’t start for another week. Only a few seniors who had returned early lingered near the entrance.

Not far ahead, at the end of the shopping district, Liu Shilei led Guan Yu into a clinic.

“Dr. Wu, busy?” Liu Shilei greeted an elderly man wearing reading glasses at the reception desk.

“Professor Liu! What brings you here? Did a student get into a fight?” The old man stood up cheerfully, guiding Guan Yu to sit beside him.

“Oh… glass shards?” The old man asked incessantly while cleaning Guan Yu’s wounds with alcohol-soaked cotton balls.

The chatterbox doctor hadn’t stopped talking since they entered. As he tended to the wounds, he rambled, “Such thick calluses on your palms—you’ve done hard labor, eh? Wait, aren’t you a student?”

“This lad’s impressive! Even with wounds like these, he doesn’t flinch at the sting of alcohol. Ah! There’s still glass inside. Don’t worry, I’ll tweeze it out. Brace yourself!”

Guan Yu rolled his eyes discreetly, turning away to avoid the talkative doctor by focusing on Liu Shilei and Mo Ling.

After multiple painful tugs with the tweezers in the deepest wound, the old man kept adjusting his glasses, seemingly struggling to see clearly.

“Sir… yanking my flesh out like that really hurts! Let me do it.” Finally exasperated, Guan Yu turned back with a bitter smile.

“Ahem… the lighting’s poor. Almost done—got it!”

“I’ll handle it.” Guan Yu swiftly took the tweezers, spread his right palm, and decisively pried open the wound. Blood immediately welled up.

Grabbing an alcohol swab to clean the blood, he directly inserted the tweezers into the wound and extracted the glass shard.

Even the old doctor gasped in astonishment at Guan Yu’s calm precision, as if the injured hand belonged to someone else.

“Young man, do you know medicine?” The chatterbox asked half-jokingly.

“A little here and there…” Guan Yu quipped casually.

“Really? What about traditional Chinese medicine? It’s our national treasure—profound knowledge! Do you understand pulse diagnosis? Mastering TCM lets you diagnose illnesses just by observing the five senses…” The old man launched into a lecture on his medical philosophies.

Beside them, Liu Shilei stifled a laugh, well-acquainted with the doctor’s endless monologues.

As Guan Yu listened, a thought struck him: if only he knew medicine himself, he could shut this chatterbox up with a few challenging questions! How peaceful that would be!

Moreover, knowing medicine would let him handle minor ailments or fight injuries himself. Not bad! If only his grades had been better—maybe he could’ve studied TCM and become a doctor, or even a gynecologist. What bliss that’d be!

Suddenly, Guan Yu’s eyes widened in delighted shock!

**Chapter 11: Misunderstanding and Conflict**

Guan Yu never imagined receiving such heavenly prompts under these circumstances. Ka—

Just as the thought formed, a yellow flash erupted in his mind, followed by dense golden characters flooding his consciousness.

Five seconds later, a notification appeared: *Healing System activated. Beginner level. Treatment efficacy: 20%.*

A golden coin reappeared in his mind’s eye, with “Healing System” stamped below its square hole.

Stunned, Guan Yu glanced at his bandaged hand, hesitating to test the ability. But with Liu Shilei, Mo Ling, and the doctor nearby, miraculous healing might expose his secret.

Suppressing the urge, he waited until the old man finished bandaging him before standing. “Thank you, doctor. How much?”

“Five yuan!” The old man smiled.

Fumbling awkwardly with his bandaged right hand, Guan Yu struggled to retrieve his wallet from his right pocket.

“I’ve got it.” Liu Shilei handed over the money casually.

“Thanks, sis! I’ll…” Guan Yu started to offer repayment but stopped, realizing quibbling over five yuan would seem overly formal.

“Let’s go.” Liu Shilei saw through his hesitation and beckoned with a smile.

“Look at you—a grown man with pants like this!” Mo Ling taunted, eyeing the hawthorn juice stains on his trousers.

Blushing, Guan Yu ignored her jabs. On their way back, he secretly activated the coin’s power. A golden flash lit his mind as warmth surged through his right arm to his palm.

Through the bandage, he felt the wound closing rapidly—heat and numbness replacing the sting. Flexing his hand, all pain vanished. If not for the audience, he’d have ripped off the bandage to check. At beginner level, this speed was unbelievable! If upgraded, he could become a miracle doctor or an undefeated fighter!

The thought set his blood boiling.

The glaring red stains drew stares all the way back. Entering Liu Shilei’s dorm, Guan Yu fetched clean pants from his suitcase but hesitated—changing in front of the women was improper.

“Use my room!” Mo Ling rolled her eyes.

“Thanks!” Guan Yu grabbed the pants and hurried out.

As feminine laughter drifted from Liu Shilei’s room, Guan Yu closed Mo Ling’s door and tossed his pants on her bed, unbuckling his belt—

A heavy knock interrupted. The unlocked door swung open halfway as Guan Yu yanked up his pants in panic.

“Lingling… you’re back?” A handsome man peered in, freezing at the sight of Guan Yu clutching his trousers.

Spotting the red stains, Feng Lei’s face twisted as if struck by lightning.

“Fuck! Who the hell are you?” Roaring, Feng Lei kicked the door wide and charged in.

Guan Yu frowned at the intruder. “What’s your problem? Who are you?”

Noticing the roses in Feng Lei’s hand, Guan Yu guessed this was Mo Ling’s suitor—now mistaking the stained pants for evidence of intimacy.

Before Guan Yu could explain, Feng Lei grabbed his collar. “Why are you in Mo Ling’s room? What did you do?”

“Let go!” Guan Yu warned, temper rising.

Spotting the bandaged hand, Feng Lei sneered and punched Guan Yu’s shoulder. “You’re dead, punk!”

Guan Yu trembled with suppressed rage. For Liu Shilei’s sake, he held back—until Feng Lei slapped his face.

Blocking the strike, Guan Yu growled, “Last warning!”

“Fuck your warnings!” Feng Lei swung again just as Mo Ling and Liu Shilei rushed in.

“Feng Lei! Stop this madness!” Mo Ling shouted.

Instantly docile, Feng Lei released Guan Yu. “Ling, I thought he was a thief! He was rummaging through your bed!”

“Liar!” Guan Yu snapped.

“Enough!” Liu Shilei coldly interjected. “Guan Yu is my younger brother. Are you accusing me too?”

Undeterred, Feng Lei smirked. “Why would I pick a fight? It’s like randomly sleeping with strangers—absurd!”

“You vile—” Liu Shilei trembled with rage.

Patting Feng Lei’s shoulder, Guan Yu sighed. “Hey…”

As Feng Lei turned, Guan Yu’s fist exploded across his face.
