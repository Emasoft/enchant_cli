“Xiao Hei (Little Black), don’t you even trust your big brother anymore?” Guan Yu proclaimed loudly. “We were truly invited by Chieftain Miao. He summoned us to discuss our objectives and propose a collaboration.”

“But since Chieftain Miao isn’t here now, you can’t just detain us because we’re outsiders, can you?” Guan Yu added with a frustrated expression, hoping to sway Xiao Hei.

“Without Elder Miao present, I cannot permit you to leave,” Xiao Hei replied. “He should return soon and escort you himself.”

“We’re pressed for time!” Guan Yu argued. “Look—the sun is setting. We must return before nightfall, yet Chieftain Miao has vanished. We cannot idly wait here.”

By now, more demon practitioners had gathered around the iron bars enclosing Guan Yu’s group, gawking at them as if they were zoo animals. Guan Yu’s heart sank. With the growing crowd and no sign of Chieftain Miao, escaping safely seemed increasingly unlikely.

Siqi approached and whispered into Guan Yu’s ear, “Time is short. If all else fails, we should retreat through the tunnel back to the waterfall. The time wasted here could have already seen us out.”

Though logical, Guan Yu loathed the idea of traversing that lengthy, damp passage again. As he deliberated, Erxiao—the youth sent to search for Chieftain Miao—returned. “Uncle Yan, Chieftain Miao is nowhere to be found. Not at his residence, the city gates, or his usual meditation spot.”

“Did you check elsewhere?” Uncle Yan asked, perplexed. “Today is the Ghost Festival. He shouldn’t have wandered far.”

“He rarely strays beyond those three places,” Erxiao said. “Aunt Miao confirmed he hasn’t returned home.”

“Are you planning to imprison us indefinitely?” Guan Yu interjected. “We have urgent matters! Why won’t you believe us? Chieftain Miao invited us to discuss affairs, shared wine, then vanished. Must we wait like fools?”

Uncle Yan remained silent, overwhelmed by the swelling crowd. Guan Yu pressed, “If you doubt us, send more men to find him! The sooner he returns, the sooner this resolves.”

Reluctantly, Uncle Yan dispatched additional searchers. Guan Yu, desperate, turned to Wang Jun and murmured, “Search Chieftain Miao’s body in the cellar. Look for anything useful—a token, perhaps.”

Wang Jun nodded and slipped away. In the cellar, he rifled through the chieftain’s robes, finding only a small pouch containing a drawn animal hide. “Pathetic,” he muttered. “Not even a coin purse.”

Outside, tension mounted until a familiar voice cut through the noise. Xiao Mei stood beyond the bars, blending seamlessly among the demon folk. Guan Yu’s hopes surged. “Xiao Mei! Help us get out! We’re trapped here for no reason!”

“This is Miao City’s forbidden zone,” Xiao Mei scoffed. “Only the chieftain may enter. Did you seek the Eight-Sided Drum Technique? Any luck?”

“None,” Guan Yu groaned. “We’re stuck without even a glimpse of it.”

Xiao Mei shrugged. “I’ve found nothing either. Time runs short—we’ll all be trapped here past nightfall.”

“Then help us find an exit! There must be a portal!”

“I know no more than you,” she replied coldly. “Wait for the chieftain.”

As hope dwindled, Wang Jun returned with the animal hide. Guan Yu presented it to Uncle Yan. “This map belongs to Chieftain Miao. Proof he was here!”

Uncle Yan scrutinized it. “This is Miao City’s terrain. How came you by it?”

“He left it behind! We’re strangers here—how else?” Guan Yu insisted. “Release us!”

“Without the chieftain’s word, you stay,” Uncle Yan declared. “You violated our sanctum. Our laws demand it.”

Defeated, Guan Yu led his group back underground. “We’ll retrace our steps through the tunnel,” he resolved. “Gather torches—we move swiftly.”

With candles wrapped in cloth and makeshift torches, they plunged into the damp passage. Navigating faster with light, they finally emerged near the waterfall, rejoining anxious allies.

“Search for a portal!” Guan Yu ordered. “Every moment counts!”

As twilight deepened, they scattered, desperation fueling their hunt—knowing failure meant a year’s entrapment in that accursed realm.
