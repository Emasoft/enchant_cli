“Where is the woman you kidnapped?” Guan Yu's face darkened with murderous intent. Time was pressing – he couldn't afford to waste another moment here with these men.

The employer had paid a hefty sum to hire them for kidnapping a woman. Their responsibility ended with protecting the employer's safety. But these two intruders clearly posed a threat, forcing them to intervene.

When the bodyguards remained silent, Guan Yu roared, “This young master has come to settle accounts with Zhang Taiping! If you value your lives, get the hell out of my way!”

He charged forward. Hou Jinshun had already holstered his pistol – dealing with these lackeys didn't require firearms that might draw unwanted attention. Guan Yu's lightning kick shattered one man's jaw. Hou Jinshun followed like a shadow, disabling six or seven bodyguards within moments. With brutal efficiency, Hou Jinshun seized a guard's wrist and snapped the arm like dry kindling, drawing agonized screams.

Inside the room, Zhang Taiping resembled a rabid beast. Pan Xiaoxia's white blouse hung in tatters, revealing expanses of alabaster skin. Overdosed on potency pills, the principal's bloodshot eyes bulged as he slobbered over his prey. The commotion outside momentarily distracted him from his carnal assault.

Pan Xiaoxia's tear-streaked face suddenly flashed hope. Mustering courage through sobs, she screamed, “Guan Yu! I'm here! Save me!” She didn't know why she called his name, but some instinct insisted only he could arrive in time.

Zhang Taiping backhanded her viciously. “Slut! After all I've done for you, still pining for that brat? My guards outside are supernatural elites! Even if he comes, they'll...” His tirade cut short as the door exploded inward. Guan Yu stormed in like an avenging deity, Hou Jinshun at his heels.

Seeing Pan Xiaoxia bound to the bed – clothes torn, face ravaged by tears – Guan Yu's heart clenched. “Don't fear. I'm here.” His gaze shifted to Zhang Taiping. “You vile beast! Today, justice will be served!” Guan Yu blurred into motion, materializing with Hou Jinshun's pistol now pressed against Zhang Taiping's temple.

Hou Jinshun patted his empty holster ruefully. Guan Yu's unpredictable prowess never ceased to amaze him. Zhang Taiping's knees buckled as icy gunmetal kissed his skin. The aphrodisiac's heat fled his veins, replaced by bladder-loosening terror. “M-mercy! She's untouched! I swear!”

A dark stain spread across Zhang Taiping's trousers. Pan Xiaoxia urgently intervened, “Guan Yu! Don't! He... he didn't...” Though rage simmered, her plea cooled Guan Yu's fury. He holstered the weapon and freed her bonds.

Zhang Taiping groveled, “Spare me! I'll pay anything!” Guan Yu's smile turned arctic. “Spare you? Never.” His kick launched the principal across the room. Snatching a wooden side table, he brought it crashing down on Zhang Taiping's ribs. The crack of splintering wood mingled with the principal's shrieks as multiple bones shattered.

After ensuring Pan Xiaoxia's safety, Guan Yu draped his jacket over her exposed form. Hou Jinshun warned, “Police will come.” They departed past cowering hotel staff, escaping as distant sirens wailed.

In the car, Guan Yu returned the pistol. “Where'd you get this?” Hou Jinshun shrugged. “Perks of managing the Flower Night Club. Many patrons are ex-military.”

At Pan Xiaoxia's apartment, tension melted into unspoken intimacy. While she bathed, Guan Yu's gaze wandered to lingerie fluttering on the balcony – scarlet lace whispering secrets. A creaking door betrayed his voyeurism as Pan Xiaxia emerged, her new sundress highlighting curves previously hidden by teacher's attire.

“See something interesting?” She gestured to a security camera. Guan Yu froze mid-excuse. Laughing, she served homemade dumplings, their savory aroma diffusing the awkwardness. Between bites, neither acknowledged the electric tension – hero and damsel no longer, but something more complicated.

Meanwhile, rumors spread like wildfire. Wei Hongwei's pamphlets exposed Zhang Taiping's depravity, transforming Guan Yu into a campus legend. As students cheered their rebel hero, the principal's wife received anonymous photos – her husband's crimes laid bare.
