“Indeed, there’s still over half a boar left. We can’t possibly finish it all. Let’s not bother with more,” Aze agreed, eyeing the surplus of wild boar meat.

Jiciyu Lang waved the exquisite wine sent by Chief Dai and teased, “Such fine liquor delivered specially, yet you’re too lazy to even taste it? Everyone’s drinking except you lounging about. If you won’t go fetch more, who will?”

“I already said this meat’s enough,” Guan Yu drawled lazily from his sprawled position on the ground. “Next time, bring ropes to rig a hammock between these trees. Would be far comfier than this damp earth.”

“Always the pampered one!” Jiciyu Lang snorted. “Hurry and catch a pheasant. Can’t you hear it clucking nearby? The boar still needs time to roast. Off you go!”

As Aze rotated the sizzling meat, its rich aroma wafted through the air. Guan Yu, initially content in his sprawl, grudgingly rose at Jiciyu Lang’s pestering.

The group feasted and drank deep into the night before staggering back. Aze and Xiao Zhi swayed drunkenly, prompting Guan Yu to suggest, “Stay here tonight. No use stumbling home.”

“Fine by me,” Aze slurred, collapsing onto Guan Yu’s bed alongside Xiao Zhi without ceremony.

Left with no choice, Guan Yu and Jiciyu Lang retreated to her quarters rather than endure the cramped chaos.

The following day’s tournament proceeded uneventfully, concluding as Guan Yu predicted—the quarterfinalists emerged: two from Xuanzhong Peak (Aze and Xiao Zhi), Siqi and Xiaolian from Juhe Peak (the latter advancing through sheer luck against feeble opponents), Ling Su and Lin Chen from Hushou Peak, and Jiang Chao from Zhulin Peak. Zuokong Peak’s numerous entrants suffered complete defeat, their numbers useless in single combat.

That evening, Guan Yu’s room buzzed with activity. Aze and Xiao Zhi lounged while Jiciyu Lang meditated silently. Wang Jun joined the gathering, unfamiliarity melting under Guan Yu’s introductions.

“Aze, what’s tomorrow’s match list?” Guan Yu pressed.

Aze grimaced. “You’re paired against Xiaolian. Always women, eh? What’s with that?”

“Watch your tongue!” Wang Jun feigned offense. “I’m a proper man, aren’t I? Why single out women?”

“You haven’t fought Guan Yu!” Aze retorted before Guan Yu cut in: “Enough. List all matchups.”

“You versus Xiaolian—easy victory. Must have judges favoring you,” Aze grumbled. Xiao Zhi patted his shoulder: “Comparing ourselves to him? Best not.”

“Xiao Zhi faces Jiang Chao. I get Ling Su. Siqi battles Lin Chen.”

“Jiang Chao? Perfect!” Xiao Zhi grinned.

Aze groaned. “I’m doomed against Ling Su.”

Guan Yu analyzed: “Your challenge is toughest. Ling Su’s wrist injury might hinder spellcasting—use that.”

Wang Jun interjected: “Semifinals will be Guan Yu, Siqi, plus two from you. Focus on advancement.”

“Any tricks to beat Ling Su?” Aze pleaded.

“No shortcuts under judges’ watch,” Guan Yu shrugged. “Ling Su’s arrogance is his weakness. Feign weakness early.”

“Useless advice!” Aze complained as Wang Jun recalled Ling Su’s flashy style.

“Act intimidated,” Guan Yu urged. “Lure him into complacency.”

The night wore on with strategizing until Wang Jun departed for lack of sleeping space.

At dawn, Xiao Zhi shook Guan Yu awake. “First match approaches! Come support me!”

“Not my fight,” Guan Yu mumbled, burying his head.

“Siqi’s waiting!” Xiao Zhi lied.

Guan Yu bolted upright. “Siqi’s here?”

Bundled outside, he found no trace of her. “Deceived again!” he growled, though the ruse succeeded.

At Hushou Peak’s crowded arena, factions clustered by peak. Guan Yu scanned Juhe Peak’s contingent—Chief Dai stood prominently, but Siqi remained elusive.

“Check Juhe’s side,” Guan Yu ordered Aze. “If Siqi didn’t summon me, you’ll pay.”

Xiao Zhi chuckled nervously. “She must be here somewhere...”

Thus began the day of quarterfinals, where pride, strategy, and hidden weaknesses would determine who’d claim the coveted semifinal spots—and the sect’s prized guidance.
