Zhou Yingjie weakly waved his hand. Just as Li Yiyang reached the door, he suddenly added, “Yiyang, if possible... put in a good word for me in front of those two!”

Li Yiyang paused, then nodded.

In Zhou Yingjie’s office, Guan Yu sat leisurely on the office chair, legs casually crossed, while Dongfang Huowu (Fire Dance) paced around like an ant on a hot skillet.

Unable to bear it any longer, Guan Yu remarked, “Could you stop pacing? You’re making me dizzy.”

“How can you sit there so carelessly, drinking tea like nothing’s wrong?” Dongfang Huowu snapped, her face flushed with anger.

“What else should I do?” Guan Yu retorted, rolling his eyes. He wanted to leave immediately, but Wang Dahu had called to say he’d arrive soon, forcing him to wait.

“You should go home and disappear!” she declared.

“Why?”

“The longer we stay together, the more my parents will misunderstand!” She plopped onto the sofa, pouting adorably.

“Misunderstand what?” Guan Yu frowned, confused how this involved her parents.

“That I’m interested in you! Don’t you realize my parents sent you here to ‘cultivate feelings’ between us? They want you to... to become my husband!”

Even the bold Dongfang Huowu stammered over “husband,” her cheeks burning crimson.

Guan Yu nearly stumbled. “What?! Your parents want to set us up?!”

“Obviously!” She glared.

Damn it! Guan Yu finally understood why Dongfang Mu had kept asking his opinion of Huowu, and why Jiang Ziqi had looked so peculiar earlier. So this was an ambush blind date!

He’d never been on a formal date before. Now, despite already having multiple partners, he’d been tricked into one? How absurd!

**Chapter 1036: Giving You a Chance to Pursue Me**

“Hey! What’s that expression? Am I not good enough for you?” Huowu demanded, irked by his dazed look.

“No, no! How could the esteemed Miss Dongfang possibly be unworthy of me? It’s me who’s unworthy of you, Your Highness!” Guan Yu wiped imaginary sweat. While Huowu’s looks and status made her a catch for anyone, he wasn’t a womanizer who chased every skirt. There needed to be genuine connection!

Plus, he already had Feng Xin, a underworld queen, at home. Adding this fiery princess would create endless clashes. He’d spend all his time playing referee!

Missing his sarcasm, Huowu lifted her chin haughtily. “Hmph, glad you know your place! You’re decent-looking, especially when fighting. But you’re still not quite worthy. Still, I’ll grant you the honor of pursuing me!”

“Pursue you?!” Guan Yu gaped. Was she this delusional?

“What if I... decline the offer?”

“No!” she snapped. “Being chosen by me is an honor! Don’t push your luck!”

Guan Yu wanted to slap himself. Why had he self-deprecated? Now this tyrant was ordering him to chase her like some pauper! He should’ve bluntly said she wasn’t good enough!

The office door burst open as Wang Dahu barged in, roaring, “Brother Guan! You alright? Did these bastards mess with you? Point ’em out—I’ll twist their heads off!”

The deputy bureau chief trailing him broke into cold sweat, fearing the hotheaded man’s threats.

Guan Yu chuckled. “Relax, Tiger. Do I look like someone who takes insults lying down?”

Wang Dahu grinned. “True! You’ve beaten Song Shaoqin and Hu Zongze—why fear petty cops?”

Thud! Zhou Yingjie, who’d just entered, collapsed upon hearing those names. Song and Hu were top-tier young masters of the capital! As a mere deputy commissioner, he couldn’t even dream of meeting them. Yet this youth had struck them and sat here unscathed? No wonder the bureau chief rushed back!

Chief Li Yanming shot Zhou a withering glare, wishing to punch the idiot who’d provoked this calamity. If things went south, Li would sacrifice Zhou to save himself.

“You’re the worm who tried locking up my brother?!” Wang Dahu lunged at Zhou, but Guan Yu intervened.

“Let it go, Tiger. He’s beneath us.”

Though Guan could crush Zhou effortlessly, it’d be beneath him to squabble with such small fry.

Wang Dahu relented, snarling at Zhou, “Scram! If I see your face again, I’ll toss you out!”

“Yes! Yes!” Zhou scrambled away gratefully, shutting the door behind him.

Li Yanming sighed at Zhou’s luck, then approached Guan Yu. “Mr. Guan, I’m Bureau Chief Li Yanming. Just call me Xiao Li.”

“Xiao Li?!” Huowu burst out laughing. “Chief Li, you’re over forty! He’s twenty-five! How’s that appropriate?”

Li flushed awkwardly. Guan Yu smiled. “I’ll stick to ‘Chief Li.’ Tell me, Chief... how close are you to the Song family?”

Li stiffened. “What do you mean?”

“You know.” Guan Yu drummed his fingers rhythmically on the chair.

Li’s throat dried. “Please speak plainly.”

“Simple. I want the entire bureau leadership purged.”

“A full purge? That’s... impossible!” Li paled. Did this madman grasp the implications?

“Impossible for others—not for you.” Guan’s tapping accelerated, each click amplifying Li’s anxiety.

After an agonized silence, Guan changed tack. “Your sister-in-law works as a Song family consultant, yes? And your son graduates soon—why not recruit him here?”

“What do you want?!” Li panicked at the mention of his son.

“I’ve stated my terms. Your move.” Guan’s gaze turned viperous, honed through clashes with the Songs—a veteran politician’s aura.

**Chapter 1037: My Ankle’s Sprained**

After a tortured pause, Li relented. “Fine. But the replacements...”

Guan turned to Wang Dahu. “Tiger, any Wang family members interested in the bureau?”

Wang’s eyes lit. “Plenty! We’ve talents to spare!”

The bureau’s jurisdiction covered Kyoto’s economic hub—a third of the city’s GDP. Soon to be a free-trade zone, its status would rival municipal headquarters. The Songs had courted Li for this golden goose, but Guan’s threats left him no choice.

“Rest assured, Chief Li,” Guan said. “The Wangs offer more than the Songs in policing circles.”

Wang Dahu clapped Li’s shoulder. “Three years—I’ll get you promoted!”

Resigned, Li accepted. With Guan’s backing, the Wangs now dominated Kyoto’s policing power.

As they left the bureau, Li Yiyang watched enviously. Director Li later commended him: “Work hard, Yiyang. Your future’s bright.”

Yiyang nodded, knowing his fate had shifted because of Guan Yu.

Outside, Wang Dahu offered a ride, but Huowu refused. “We’ll walk!”

“Walk?!” Guan Yu groaned. Their car was two miles away, midday with no taxis.

“Then walk!” She shrugged.

After several steps, Guan realized she wasn’t following. “Coming?”

“Guan Yu...” she whimpered. “My ankle’s sprained.”

He inspected the swollen joint. “When did this happen?!”

“During the fight.” She’d hidden the pain until now. Her endurance impressed him.

“Take off your shoe. I’ll massage it.”

“So you can grope me? No way!”

“Fine! Suffer!” He turned to leave.

“Wait!” she cried. “Carry me!”

**Chapter 1038: Carrying You**

“Call your brother! Say I bullied you!” Guan Yu retorted.

“Please...” She pouted. “My ankle really hurts!”

Sighing, he approached. “Up you go.”

“Not piggyback! Carry me properly!”

Rolling his eyes, he scooped her up bridal-style. She looped arms around his neck, hiding a smirk. This wasn’t so bad...

As they walked, her earlier bravado melted into shy contentment. Guan Yu, meanwhile, marveled at life’s absurdity—corrupt officials, fiery maidens, and now this. What next?
