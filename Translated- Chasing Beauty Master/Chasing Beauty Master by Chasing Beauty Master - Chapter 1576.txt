“People above,” Guan Yu declared, “I must first warn you—our group is not as simple as we appear. Even now, shadows may already stalk your backs. Should you dare attack us, your deaths will come swiftly and mysteriously.”

As Guan Yu spoke, Wang Xiaorong slipped into a shadowed corner, silently took aim with her crossbow, and loosed a bolt without hesitation.

This being only her second time using the weapon, her aim faltered. The shot veered slightly but struck true, embedding itself in the target’s arm.

The central figure—caught utterly unaware—jerked back with a pained grunt as his right arm was pierced. He staggered several steps in retreat, face pale.

“Who’s there?” Yan Zhao barked in alarm, clutching her bleeding arm. Though uncertain of the threat’s veracity, the searing agony left no room for doubt. “Search the rear! Find them!”

Only then did she realize the bolt had come from the front, not behind. Her heart hammered in her throat. Had it struck her head or chest, she’d be dead already.

“I warned you not to underestimate us,” Guan Yu called out, voice ringing. “Withdraw now, or none of you will leave alive. This wound is but a mercy from His Highness. Had he willed it, you’d already be a corpse.”

“Retreat!” Yan Zhao snarled through gritted teeth. The inexplicably burning wound—as if salted—and the oppressive sense of danger left no choice. Better to regroup than risk annihilation by unseen forces. Her plan, days in the making—felling trees under torrential rains to block roads, arranging boulders as traps—had crumbled before even being sprung. The ambush on Prince Zou’s party had backfired spectacularly.

Most of Yan Zhao’s forces were mercenaries, with only a few Demon Soul Sect operatives lurking in reserve. Now, even that contingency proved unnecessary. The mission dissolved into retreat.

What had seemed a dire crisis dissolved under Wang Xiaorong’s single bolt. Guan Yu approached the royal carriage. “Your Highness, the path is clear. We should make haste.”

“Agreed,” Prince Zou replied. “Have the column turn back. We continue our original route.” The swift resolution surprised even him.

**Chapter 4087: The Only Way**

Among Prince Zou’s hired guards, whispers spread. Why had their lord spent fortunes recruiting them when hidden masters like this existed? What power could strike from such distances? Their minds reeled at the implications.

Having repelled this threat, Prince Zou felt emboldened. Even Imperial Guards might now be met head-on. He resolved to further expand his retinue in Mingwen City—numbers meant safety, regardless of the recruits’ origins.

The trade road buzzed with mounted travelers overtaking their procession. Tensions eased as the group advanced, the looming forest ahead their final trial. Guan Yu, however, remained wary—too convenient, this calm.

Catching up to a massive merchant caravan blocking the path, frustration mounted. Fifty strong with heavily laden wagons, they choked the narrow road. While riders might squeeze past, the royal carriages stood trapped.

“This pace is untenable,” Prince Zou fretted. “If we crawl thus through the woods, we’ll be sitting ducks. Wu Hui—negotiate passage. Offer silver if needed.”

The compromise came: merchants would edge aside, allowing single-file passage. Guan Yu approved—keeping the civilians distant might spare them when (not if) ambush came.

“They’ve accepted,” reported Zou Wuhui. “But the path remains narrow. We’ll need extended formation.”

“Make it so,” the prince ordered.

As reorganization commenced, Guan Yu’s sharp eyes noted discrepancies. These “merchants” lacked weather-beaten faces; their wagons showed no travel wear. Young, able-bodied “traders” stood five per cart—no elders or children. Fresh suspicion ignited.

“To arms!” Guan Yu roared—a heartbeat before enemy shouts erupted.

“Kill them all! Leave none!”

The facade shattered. “Merchants” drew blades from wagon bellies, surging forward. Trapped mid-column, the royal carriage became a death trap. Guan Yu leapt into the fray, seizing a sword as chaos erupted.

“Xiaorong—guard the prince!” he shouted, cutting down attackers. “Strike any who approach!”

Though outnumbered, the prince’s hired blades held firm—for now. Zou Wuhui and Zou Wuxiao fought like demons, but losses mounted. Desertions thinned their ranks further.

Spotting the enemy commander observing from horseback, Guan Yu charged. “Er Yatou! Cover me!”

Wang Jun’s crossbow sang as Guan Yu carved a crimson path. Reaching the frontlines, he faced a dozen defenders. Beyond them, the enemy leader barked new orders.

“Douse them in fire oil!”

Barrels tumbled from wagons, acrid liquid flooding the road. A single spark would create an inferno.

“Surrender the prince,” the commander taunted, “and the rest may live.”

“Fool’s bargain!” Guan Yu shot back. “Elite Troops under Eunuch Yu Kong dare not leave witnesses. You’ll slaughter everyone—yours included—to hide this treason.”

The commander blanched. “How...?”

“Only the palace breeds such disciplined killers. The Imperial Guard’s reputation is ash, leaving your master’s pet butchers. But your flames will consume your own men too.”

Murmurs rippled through enemy ranks. Guan Yu pressed the advantage: “Hear that, hired blades? Your paymasters will silence you next! Fight now, or die later!”

**Chapter 4088: Desperate Defense**

“We chose this peril guarding His Highness,” Guan Yu roared, blade flashing. “Our lives are forfeit—what more can you take?”

Wang Jun amplified: “Their fire oil traps you too! Will you die for masters who’ll kill you after?”

The Elite Troop commander sneered. “Clever words change nothing. Burn them!”

As archers nocked flaming arrows, Guan Yu’s mind raced. The semi-circle of royal defenders tightened around the carriage—a shrinking island in an oil sea.

“Wu Hui! Wu Xiao! Behead their leader!” Guan Yu ordered. The twins tore through enemy lines toward the commander.

Guan Yu abandoned defense for offense, internal energy surging as he battered through guards. Wang Jun’s bolts picked off flanking attackers. Xiaorong stood sentinel at the carriage, blade ready.

When an enemy lunged at Prince Zou’s window, Xiao Zhi barely parried—until Second Squad Leader reinforced them. “Focus!” the veteran barked. “No slips!”

Above the din, the twins reached the commander’s guard. Steel clashed as the oil stench thickened. A flaming arrow arced skyward—
