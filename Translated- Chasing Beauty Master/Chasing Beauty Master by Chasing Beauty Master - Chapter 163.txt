Old Master Feng continued to jest, deliberately bringing up the awkward subject: "What was Guan Yu saying earlier about someone insulting his woman? Haha! It seems this old man overstepped unnecessarily."

The implication was that Guan Yu himself should have been the one to overturn those five bodyguards, not the elderly gentleman.

The crowd joined in laughter.

Feng Xin’s ears turned red. She stamped her foot lightly and shot Old Master Feng a fierce glare.

Guan Yu’s face flushed with embarrassment as he changed the subject: "Old Master Feng, I could never match your martial prowess. Today’s demonstration makes me realize how lax I’ve been in my training recently. I must practice more diligently."

Delighted, Old Master Feng chuckled: "Easily said! I’d be most pleased if you visited more often. I’ll teach you everything I know."

Old Master Xu slapped his thigh regretfully: "Curse my hesitation! Let this old coot steal the spotlight. Guan Yu, mark my words – my martial skills rival Old Feng’s. Frequent my halls, and I’ll impart all my secrets too!"

Not to be outdone, Old Master Lin also offered to teach Guan Yu his unique techniques.

Old Master Feng raised no objections. It would be Guan Yu’s good fortune to learn these veterans’ signature skills. He harbored no fear of rivals stealing his prospective grandson-in-law – none of them had granddaughters to offer anyway.

Xu Dalong stood silently in the corner, struggling to process events. Guan Yu’s favor with the three elders, his masterful handling of Park Xu’s punishment, and now this competition to mentor him – each revelation strained comprehension. Even as Old Master Xu’s blood grandson, he’d only received superficial teachings. Yet here was Guan Yu, being courted without asking! The injustice of comparison burned.

Despite earlier unpleasantness, the banquet concluded merrily. After seeing the elders off, only Xiao Xiong and Guan Yu remained at the table.

Guan Yu offered a Red River cigarette. As smoke curled between them, Xiao Xiong regarded him meaningfully: "I’ve reconsidered. Installing you as Dragon-Tiger Hall’s leader now might not bring the chaos you predicted. I underestimated you – and suddenly regret my prior decision."

Guan Yu started panicking: "Brother, spare me this! You’re far more suited to leadership. I couldn’t possibly—"

"Couldn’t? Then why do all N City’s underworld bosses seek your favor? How do four women coexist peacefully in your villa? Why didn’t you blink while crossing Sanxie Group’s heir – a true business titan?" Xiao Xiong’s rapid-fire questions left Guan Yu speechless. The truths were undeniable.

Guan Yu sighed inwardly. Since acquiring that mysterious copper coin six months prior, he’d risen to prominence in N City with startling speed. Life’s unpredictability made it thrilling.

"Worry not," Xiao Xiong continued. "With great power comes corresponding burdens. I’ll manage L City as your deputy. What’s yours remains yours. Now I must return – who knows what changes await there?"

Grateful, Guan Yu escorted Xiao Xiong out. The hotel manager approached respectfully: "Brother Yu, Sister Xin arranged a vehicle for your guest."

As Xiao Xiong roared with laughter at the thoughtful gesture, Guan Yu’s phone vibrated. The caller ID puzzled him.

"Director Li! To what do I owe this honor?" Guan Yu answered cheerfully.

Chapter 401: Journey to the Capital

Li Yuanshan’s booming voice carried genuine warmth: "Younger brother! I called immediately upon hearing your release. First, my apologies – despite efforts, I proved ineffective in your predicament."

Though miles apart, Guan Yu felt the sincerity. Fang Zhe had already informed him of Li’s exhaustive efforts – including a billion-yuan investment in J Province to secure his freedom. This debt would not be forgotten.

"Younger brother’s too kind. Should you ever need me, I’ll answer without hesitation."

Li’s satisfaction was audible: "Your discernment serves you well. Beyond apologies, I contact you regarding Beijing’s charity gala next week – a gathering of China’s business elite. Any interest?"

Guan Yu frowned. What use had he, neither wealthy nor influential, for such events?

"Surface philanthropy masks deeper currents," Li explained. "It’s a nexus for connecting with powerful figures. Given your current expansion needs, this could prove invaluable."

Understanding dawned. With Sanxie Group thoroughly antagonized, growth became imperative. "I’ll attend," Guan Yu decided.

"Come tomorrow," Li urged. "Let me show you the capital. I’ve yet to properly thank you for past benefits."

Guan Yu agreed, thinking of Zhao Jing’er. An early arrival meant more time with her grandfather.

In a Beijing villa, Li concluded the call with barely contained excitement. Beside him stood a celestial beauty – porcelain skin, cherry lips, eyes like painted willows – yet her expression held glacial detachment.

"Rare to see you so invested," the woman remarked. "Ten billion for questionable ventures? Hardly profitable."

Li smiled paternally: "Worth every fen. As merchant-prince, I seek value. Ten billion bought his trust – cheap at twice the price. Xi’er, understanding follows acquaintance."

Li Xi gazed distantly: "Now I’m... intrigued."

Privately, Li mused: *Would that he might wed my daughter! Can this youth tame my ice phoenix? The prospect tantalizes.*

Chapter 402: Death Warrant

Traveling with beauties sounds idyllic – only veterans know its tribulations.

After school pickup, Guan Yu announced: "Jing’er, pack tonight. We leave for Beijing tomorrow."

Her eyes sparkled at visiting Grandpa. Wen Qing pouted: "Husband, take me too!"

"Charity affairs aren’t for students," Guan Yu deflected. "Attend classes."

As the women departed, Guan Yu headed campus-ward. Wen Qing teased: "Bidding farewell to Teacher Mo Ling?"

He rolled eyes. The real farewell concerned Liu Shilei.

At Shilei’s apartment, Mo Ling answered coldly. Through dinner’s awkwardness, Guan Yu requested leave. Shilei’s reproach melted at Jing’er’s circumstances.

Later, in a presidential suite, passionate cries echoed. Meanwhile, Park Xu stared at his frostbitten manhood in a hospital bed, physicians pronouncing recovery unlikely. Rage consumed him.
