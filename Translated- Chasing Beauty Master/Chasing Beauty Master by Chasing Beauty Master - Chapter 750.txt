The audience erupted into another round of applause. When Guan Yu returned to Kaihuang Academy's spectator area, Chen Tianxiao gazed at him with newfound reverence, as if beholding an idol. Though Guan Yu possessed true martial prowess rather than mere celebrity charm—a distinction worth noting.

Century Garden Academy staff carried Cao Jin off the arena for hospitalization. Guan Yu watched silently, knowing conventional medical treatment would prove futile. What Cao Jin truly needed was a master capable of channeling inner energy to heal his wounds.

After composing himself, Chen Tianxiao remarked solemnly, “Guan Yu, you’ve far exceeded my expectations. You don’t strike me as an ordinary student. Your appearance... it doesn’t match the age your features suggest.”

Guan Yu first waved triumphantly at Xue Jing and the others above, signaling his victory. The women cheered and waved back, while Yang Conghan flashed him a thumbs-up.

Avoiding Chen Tianxiao’s probing question about his ageless appearance, Guan Yu deflected, “What’s wrong with eternally looking twenty? Wouldn’t most consider that a blessing?”

Chen Tianxiao chuckled. “Who could’ve imagined Cao Jin was a Berserker? I’d never even heard of such beings before today. Yet you defeated him. Had it been me, I’d have surrendered immediately.”

“That’s you,” Guan Yu retorted pointedly. “The word ‘surrender’ doesn’t exist in my vocabulary.”

“Naturally! With your strength, mine wouldn’t either,” Chen Tianxiao conceded, sparking laughter from the crowd.

The subsequent match between Wang Hu and Fang Su proved anticlimactic. As Wang Hu deployed his defensive shield, spectators yawned—Guan Yu’s earlier dazzling energy dome had raised expectations too high. The arena filled with impatient jeers, audiences craving swift resolution to this tedious stalemate.

Zhang Han, after nibbling snacks beside Guan Yu, suddenly curled onto his lap. Nestling her head against his shoulder, she murmured, “Uncle, I’m sleepy. Hold me.” Guan Yu sighed but obliged, cradling the dozing girl.

Earlier, Zhang Han had watched Guan Yu’s match intently, unconcerned about his safety. She knew even if defeated, survival mattered most. But this current bout bored her to drowsiness—Wang Hu stood motionless behind his shield while Fang Su’s futile attacks resembled a kitten swatting at armor.

The deadlock stretched ten excruciating minutes. Guan Yu had advised Wang Hu pre-match: “Stay calm, maintain the shield regardless of provocation.” Wang Hu obeyed religiously, becoming a statue of defense.

As spectators grew restless, Fang Su’s composure crumbled. Sweat dripped from his brow as he fruitlessly hammered the impenetrable barrier. Guan Yu observed Fang Su’s mounting desperation—any competent fighter would’ve exploited these openings. Yet Wang Hu persisted in his defensive trance.

“Is he an idiot?” Guan Yu wondered internally. Meanwhile, Zhang Han slept soundly in his arms, her floral breath tickling his nostrils.

The farce escalated until Fang Su resorted to literal biting and scratching. Wang Hu remained impassive as a mountain. After twenty more minutes, Fang Su collapsed, gasping, “I yield! I yield!”

Boos erupted. “What garbage match!” “Embarrassing clowns!” The referee reluctantly announced Wang Hu’s victory, concluding Kaihuang’s 3-1 triumph over Century Garden.

Post-match, Principal Hong beamed. “Outstanding performance! To celebrate, the school treats everyone to a feast—except Guan Yu, who’ll dine separately with his... entourage.”

Chen Tianxiao mentioned the upcoming individual championship—a national cultivator’s honor. Guan Yu dismissed it: “Titles mean nothing. True masters seek self-improvement, not trophies.”

As the group departed, Zhang Han’s antics resumed. At the Japanese restaurant, her bare feet—adorably painted with panda motifs—drew unwanted attention. When lecherous students from rival LanZhe Academy approached, she silenced one with a well-aimed kick to the groin.

“Bring water! My heel’s contaminated,” she demanded, ignoring the howling offender. LanZhe members threatened retaliation, but Guan Yu’s crew remained unperturbed, their collective aura warning against further foolishness.

The scene crystallized their dynamic—Guan Yu’s nonchalant strength, his companions’ vibrant personalities, and the brewing storm of rivalries yet to unfold.
