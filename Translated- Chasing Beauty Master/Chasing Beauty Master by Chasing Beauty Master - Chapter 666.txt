The reason Bu Shiren didn’t seek help from the police or powerful mutants to deal with Guan Yu was his desire to personally redeem his dignity before Sun Xiaoya. Though aware of Guan Yu’s strength, Bu Shiren dismissed it as mere mastery of ancient martial arts. He persuaded his father, Vice Governor Bu Zhaodiao, to enlist a mysterious figure who exponentially boosted his own power within days.

When Guan Yu had humiliated him previously, he’d only displayed marginally superior skill. Now, brimming with newfound confidence, Bu Shiren returned to school, intent on crushing Guan Yu. Spotting Sun Xiaoya’s car parked below, he headed to her office—only to stumble upon Guan Yu moments away from kissing her. A startled gasp from Sun Xiaoya alerted Bu Shiren, who barged in.

*Damn it, you’re like a lingering ghost!* Guan Yu cursed inwardly. *Every time I try to flirt with this beauty, you materialize. Are you some spectral pest?*

Bu Shiren’s rage boiled over. Last time, he’d dismissed Sun Xiaoya’s teasing of Guan Yu as a “little rogue,” but now he witnessed her blushing in Guan Yu’s embrace, offering only token resistance. The truth was undeniable: their relationship transcended teacher and student.

Consumed by jealousy and emboldened by his enhanced abilities, Bu Shiren forewent words. His hand morphed into a metallic eagle’s claw, slashing toward Guan Yu’s skull with a whistling strike.

Guan Yu instantly sensed the disparity. Previously, Bu Shiren’s strength as a Pseudo-ESPer had barely rivaled 20% of a Third-Class Mutant. Now, his speed and power neared 80%—a shocking leap. *How?* Guan Yu wondered. Pseudo-ESPers gained powers through irreversible injections, not training. Had Bu Shiren sought the Wang Manqing family’s forbidden methods?

Sun Xiaoya, though ordinary, recognized the lethal intent. “Guan Yu, be careful!” she cried.

“Adulterous couple!” Bu Shiren spat, incensed by her concern.

Guan Yu’s palm shimmered with golden aura, intercepting the claw effortlessly. Though capable of killing Bu Shiren instantly, he held back—this fool deserved humiliation, not death.

**Chapter 1692: Uncle Guan**

While Guan Yu remained unfazed, Bu Shiren gaped in disbelief. During their last clash, Guan Yu had seemed only slightly stronger—perhaps a scion of a martial arts lineage or another Pseudo-ESPer. Yet the mysterious enhancer had claimed *no one* except true mutants could withstand his attacks. *How is this possible?*

Bu Shiren’s bravado, a fragile veneer built on paternal privilege, crumbled. Though his current strength nearly matched Mu Yun’s, he lacked her battle-hardened resolve. Accustomed to bullying the weak, he faltered before true power.

His claw strike, capable of gouging concrete, met Guan Yu’s immovable palm. Sweat drenched Bu Shiren as overwhelming force pressed down. “H-how… did *you* grow stronger too?!”

Witnessing Bu Shiren’s rapid shift from aggressor to coward, Sun Xiaoya’s disdain deepened. Guan Yu smirked. “Teacher Bu, spent already? A ‘one-second man,’ are we?”

The barb struck true. Bu Shiren, notorious for his bedroom inadequacies despite womanizing, roared: “*You’re* the one-second man! Your whole family!”

Guan Yu laughed uproariously. “Brother, why chase beauties when you can’t ‘utilize’ them? Wasteful, no?”

Sun Xiaoya blinked innocently. “What’s a ‘one-second man’? Is he faster than sprinters?”

Deeming this mockery, Bu Shiren screeched: “You think my father—the Vice Governor—won’t have you arrested? Begging won’t save you!”

A voice interrupted from the doorway: “Oh? Which Vice Governor dares arrest people whimsically?”

Liu Shilei and Du Xiaojuan had arrived, the latter curious about Sun Xiaoya’s famed beauty. Hearing Bu Shiren’s threats, Du Xiaojuan coldly remarked: “Young Master Bu, such grandeur!”

Recognizing her, Bu Shiren paled. “A-Aunt Du! Why are you here?”

“Apologize to your *Uncle Guan* first,” Du Xiaojuan snapped. “Kowtow, and perhaps he’ll forgive you.”

**Chapter 1693: Horizon Group**

“Uncle Guan?!” Bu Shiren spluttered, staring at the teen. “He’s younger than me!”

Du Xiaojuan’s glare silenced him. “Did your father never mention Horizon Group’s true chairman?”

Horizon Group—the conglomerate behind his father’s political ascent. A name echoed since childhood: *Guan Yu*. But that Guan Yu had vanished into the “Divine Realm” two decades prior.

Yet here stood a youth with the same name and face from old photos. Bu Shiren staggered back. “Y-you… Uncle Guan?!”

Guan Yu nodded. “Be a good boy. Stop harassing ‘Aunt Xiaoya.’ Send regards to your father—I’ll visit soon.”

The humiliation of deferring to a younger “uncle” choked Bu Shiren, but Horizon’s influence dwarfed even a Vice Governor’s. With three of China’s twenty-four mutants under its banner, defiance was futile.

After Bu Shiren slunk away, Sun Xiaoya bowed to Du Xiaojuan. “Thank you, Sister.”

Du Xiaojuan clasped her hand. “A peerless beauty indeed—no wonder Guan Yu lingers here. We’ll be sisters now Horizon is his again.”

Blushing, Sun Xiaoya acquiesced silently.

**Chapter 1694: Forever Together**

That night, Guan Yu prepared to depart for the capital. At the Sun residence, a trailing black SUV initially alarmed him until Du Xiaojuan identified it as her escort—a Second-Class Mutant and Pseudo-ESPers.

“Even governors lack such security,” Guan Yu remarked, impressed.

Liu Shilei smiled. “Horizon’s three mutants deter rivals.”

Sun Xiaoya, awed by the women’s poise, flinched when Guan Yu grasped her hand. At dinner, Sun’s mother—improving but still delusional—hailed Guan Yu as her son-in-law.

Later, Du Xiaojuan and Liu Shilei tactfully departed, leaving Guan Yu with Sun Xiaoya. “I’m homeless tonight,” he whispered. “Lend me half your bed?”

Her cheeks burned. “Behave… or else.”

After treating her mother, Guan Yu hesitated outside Sun Xiaoya’s room. Inside, she clutched her blanket, heart racing. The inevitable loomed—a threshold between innocence and surrender.

Guan Yu lingered in the dark, torn between desire and retreat.
