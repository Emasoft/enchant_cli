“Of course not,” the Artifact Spirit replied. “My physical form has already been shattered. What’s sealed here now is merely the remnants of my divine consciousness—and only within this space can I continue to exist. If I were to leave, I would vanish into ashes.”

Guan Yu nodded. “Ah, I see. Truly, there will always be someone greater beyond oneself. I thought I’d become quite formidable, but hearing this... whoever defeated you back then must have been unimaginably powerful?”

Truthfully, even if releasing the Artifact Spirit were possible, Guan Yu wouldn’t do it. The risk of this creature running amok unchecked was far too grave.

The Artifact Spirit snorted. “Correct. When I was defeated, I yielded wholeheartedly. I willingly allowed myself to be sealed here, for I recognized my sins—slaughtering so many innocents. Thus, I chose eternal imprisonment to atone.

“Otherwise, had I resisted, even in defeat, no force could have bound me here. I would have simply detonated my Primordial Spirit rather than endure this.”

“So that’s how it is,” Guan Yu mused. “It seems you were once a noble Beastkin Prince, albeit overly fond of mischief. Still, guarding the Imperial Seal all these years as penance... I’d say you’ve more than redeemed yourself. If a way exists to free you, I’ll gladly assist.

“After all,” he added, “this Imperial Seal means little to me. Destroying it matters not—you’ve seen how rarely I wield it.”

“I’ve never considered such possibilities,” the Artifact Spirit said. “As your bound guardian, I dare not entertain rebellious thoughts. My sole duty is to serve my master.”

“You needn’t cling to formalities,” Guan Yu insisted earnestly. “We could interact as true friends. I genuinely wish to help you—please believe that.”

*What value does the Imperial Seal hold?* Guan Yu pondered. *Its greatest function is storing four spells—and to recharge those, I must beg Jiu Shiyé or Xuan Ming, being incapable myself. Should relations with Yunqing Sect sour someday, this artifact becomes worthless without experts to replenish its power.*

Chapter 4208: That’s Exactly What It Means

By the time Guan Yu could store advanced spells independently, years might pass. Freeing this Beastkin Prince might grant him a formidable, obedient ally—a living weapon far surpassing the Seal’s utility. With such a creature at his side, dominating the martial world would become reality.

The Artifact Spirit hesitated. “At minimum, I’d require a vessel—a body robust enough to contain my soul. But this is impossible in the Mortal Realm, where Beastkin forms don’t exist.”

Guan Yu’s hopes deflated. Indeed, procuring such a vessel here was unthinkable. “This... I truly cannot accomplish, at least not presently,” he admitted, meeting the spirit’s gaze. “But should opportunity arise, I’ll strive to aid you.”

“I appreciate your consideration,” the spirit replied warmly. “Yet I’ve grown accustomed here. Though bodiless, my soul suffers no torment. In this eternal tranquility, I’ve found a form of peace—a peculiar blessing.”

*To each their own,* Guan Yu reflected. *Even beasts have their aspirations.* Though self-interest colored his thoughts, freeing the spirit remained beyond current means.

Changing subjects, he asked, “What else have you gleaned from studying the Eight-Sided Drum technique besides its formidable nature?”

“Its most sinister quality,” the spirit warned, “is its capacity to devour the practitioner’s will. This art likely harbors its own consciousness. When all four volumes unite, completing its spiritual matrix, the risk of possession becomes dire unless one’s mental fortitude surpasses Meng Hua the Ancestor’s.”

“How treacherous!” Guan Yu exclaimed. Now he understood—even collecting the complete technique didn’t guarantee safe usage. The backlash could prove catastrophic.

“Can’t we extract this consciousness?” he pressed. “Such a powerful art left unused is wasteful. Moreover, I’ve located the second volume—it’ll appear in Miao City’s desert on the fifteenth of July.”

“The consciousness was deliberately embedded by the technique’s creator,” the spirit explained. “Extraction might be possible... but only after collecting all four volumes, and even then, the process would be perilous.”

Their conversation proved enlightening. Guan Yu resolved to consult this ancient spirit more often. Suddenly, the space trembled as external shouts pierced through: “Ambush ahead! Maximum alert!”

The Artifact Spirit frowned. “Normally, this realm blocks all external stimuli. The disturbance originates from your physical surroundings—you must return immediately!”

Reality snapped back into focus. Guan Yu found himself astride his horse, the caravan halted in a narrow gorge. Torchlight flickered above as armed figures lined the cliffs. Wang Xiaorong stirred in his arms.

“What’s happening?” she mumbled sleepily.

“Imperial Guards, most likely,” Guan Yu murmured, surveying the trap. Over a hundred enemies flanked the heights while fifty more blocked the path ahead.

Prince Zou’s caravan stood paralyzed. If attackers rained firebrands or boulders, annihilation was certain. Guan Yu’s mind raced—neutralizing their commander offered the only hope, but no familiar officers were visible.

Chapter 4209: Never Retreat

“You dare threaten Imperial kin?” Guan Yu shouted upward, buying time. “We’re mere merchants! What prince do you speak of?”

“Spare your lies!” came the retort. “Surrender Zou within half an incense time, or perish!”

As panic threatened to spread, Red Blade—former bandit leader turned ally—roared defiance: “My six hundred brothers surround you! Attack, and none shall leave alive!”

The bluff steadied nervous allies. Guan Yu swiftly coordinated countermeasures—extinguishing torches to shroud their movements, dispersing the prince among guards while feigning retreat.

Boulders crashed down as they withdrew, but darkness limited casualties. Reaching safer ground, Guan Yu split forces: “Protect the prince! Red Blade—flank left! We’ll crush these curs!”

Dawn’s first light revealed Guan Yu staggering back hours later, armor bloodied but triumphant. The ambush lay shattered, though losses remained uncounted.

“They’ll think twice before challenging us again,” Guan Yu rasped, surveying the aftermath. Though exhaustion weighted his limbs, satisfaction burned bright—their enemies had learned the price of crossing Guan Yu’s resolve.
