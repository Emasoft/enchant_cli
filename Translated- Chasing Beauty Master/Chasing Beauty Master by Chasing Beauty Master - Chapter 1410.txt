“Judging by the man’s attire, he clearly wasn’t ordinary. Given this was his turf, it was best not to stir trouble,” Guan Yu thought as he turned to return to his room. Suddenly, a door creaked open nearby, and a disheveled figure stumbled out, eyes still squinted shut from sleep.

“Who’s looking for me at this ungodly hour?” grumbled the man—the same one Wang Xiaorong had seen earlier, his head wrapped in a black cloth resembling a towel.

The middle-aged woman beamed. “You must be Mr. Yue Gao, correct?”

“Yes, that’s me. And who are you? Who seeks someone out so late? Can’t this wait till morning?” Mr. Yue Gao replied irritably.

Guan Yu recalled Wang Xiaorong mentioning this peculiar man who had carried a large cloth sack up the mountain. Even now, the black towel remained tied around his head. *Does he sleep with it on?* he wondered. The man’s swarthy skin, tuft of beard, and scholarly air added to his eccentricity.

“Mr. Yue Gao,” the woman said apologetically, “we were supposed to meet tomorrow, but I need you to investigate something urgently. I feared discovery by morning, hence this intrusion. My deepest apologies.”

Guan Yu raised an eyebrow. This wealthy matron spoke with unexpected courtesy, contrary to her haughty reputation.

Yue Gao suppressed a sigh. “Very well. What’s so urgent?”

The woman produced a bundle and handed him several papers. “As the renowned detective here, I ask you to investigate this woman.”

*Ah,* Guan Yu mused, *she’s likely discovered her young husband’s affair and rushes to hire a detective under cover of night.* Such dramas were common in modern cities, but here? Intriguing.

Yue Gao took the documents, finally prying his narrow eyes open—slits so thin Wang Xiaorong had likened them to cracks. Guan Yu now realized the man hadn’t been squinting earlier; his eyes were simply that small. As Yue Gao scrutinized the papers, his lids lifted marginally, though still disproportionate to his sharp features.

*An avant-garde look for a detective,* Guan Yu observed. Short stature, tiny eyes, yet an air of shrewdness. *No wonder he’s in this trade.* But would a true professional take petty cases like exposing mistresses? Unless the pay justified it—a lesson in the pragmatism of commerce.

“Profit drives all,” Guan Yu mused, recalling the counterfeit goods flooding markets. Perhaps this detective’s reputation was inflated. Regardless, it was none of his concern. He turned to leave.

“You wish to investigate your son’s girlfriend?” Yue Gao’s question halted him. *So the matron targets her future daughter-in-law, not a spouse’s lover.*

Yue Gao read aloud: “Your son plans to marry Yu Qingtian (Rain Clear Sky), eighteen, youngest daughter of the Yu household in Westpeak City. Studied medicine under family tutelage, aspires to serve as a physician. An impeccable match. What objections could you have, Madam Wan?”

Guan Yu peered at the accompanying portrait—a striking beauty. *A cultured woman in the martial world? Rare indeed.*

Madam Wan hesitated. “I... have no specific objections, but...”

“But her perfection unsettles you?” Guan Yu interjected. “Humans itch to fault the flawless. Correct, Madam?”

“Who are you?” she snapped.

“A concerned observer. Your haste suggests deep aversion to this match.”

Yue Gao intervened smoothly, “Madam, your husband Wan Tianyi (Heavenly One)—the Emperor’s appointed Royal Steward—would disapprove of harassing his son’s betrothed.”

“She schemes against my son!”

Guan Yu stepped forward. “Or her virtue threatens you? A would-be healer can’t be wholly wicked. Your envy of excellence speaks louder.”

Madam Wan bristled. “This is between Mr. Yue Gao and me!”

“Ah, but Guan Yu often assists me,” Yue Gao lied tactfully. “A trusted associate.”

Relenting, Madam Wan explained, “Visit our estate. My husband understands the situation.”

“Your husband knows?” Guan Yu pressed.

“The Royal Steward’s reputation mustn’t be tarnished,” she said. “Hence my nocturnal visit.”

Guan Yu grinned. “Then let us accompany Yue Gao. Intrigue awaits!”

As Wang Xiaorong emerged, questioning the delay, Guan Yu whispered, “Adventure calls.”

At the Wan estate, they encountered Yu Qingtian herself—radiant, composed, and unwelcome. Madam Wan sneered, “Who invited you here?”

“I did,” declared a handsome youth adorned with priceless jade—Wan Guocai (Talent of Ten Thousand Nations), the heir. His defiance of his stepmother crackled in the air.

“Father refuses to meet her,” he said, “but I’ll persist.”

“We’ll never approve!” Madam Wan spat.

Yu Qingtian bowed, composure unbroken. “Forgive my intrusion, Madam.”

“You’ve no right to call me that!”

Wang Xiaorong gripped Guan Yu’s arm, appalled by the cruelty. Guan Yu noted Wan Guocai’s muttered “second wife”—explaining the stepmother’s venom.

As tensions mounted, Guan Yu studied the players: the icy matron, the resolute heir, the graceful physician-to-be. *A drama worthy of the finest playwrights,* he thought, *and we’ve front-row seats.*
