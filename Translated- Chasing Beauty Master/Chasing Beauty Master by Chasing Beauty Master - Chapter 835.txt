The crowd realized she had willingly chosen this path, making any forceful intervention impossible. Feng Xihu (West Lake Feng) kept pushing people away, determined to drive them off.

After repeated back-and-forth, the onlookers gradually dispersed, finding little entertainment left in the spectacle. Soon, the scene emptied entirely.

Only Guan Yu, Feng Xihu, and Lan Yu (Blue Jade) remained. Lan Yu happily looped her arm through Guan Yu’s and asked, “Did you really sneak a peek at me last night? What did you see?”

Her tone brimmed with excitement, as though she secretly hoped he’d glimpsed something private. Guan Yu forced a wry smile. “Be good, Yuer. Let’s discuss this later. We have matters to settle here first.”

Lan Yu nodded obediently but met Feng Xihu’s murderous glare. She tilted her head. “Guan Yu, who is she? I’ve never seen her among your women.”

The question stumped Guan Yu. After a pause, he explained, “She’s here over a misunderstanding.” Turning to Feng Xihu, he added, “As you see, I already have a wife. That incident was a mistake. Please respect boundaries.”

Using Lan Yu as a shield, Guan Yu startled her by publicly calling her “wife” for the first time. Her cheeks flushed pink with delight.

Feng Xihu remained unmoved. “I know you have many women,” she said flatly. “If you already keep so many, why reject adding me?”

Exasperated, Guan Yu hardened his tone. “You’re from the Feng family. I’m destined to oppose your clan. There’s no possibility between us.” He hoped this ultimatum would sever her attachment.

Feng Xihu grew eerily calm, silently studying him. If he drew this line, she’d have to choose between her family and him.

**Chapter 2138: Forgotten by Her Man**

“Are you Feng Xihu?” Lan Yu whispered. Her own family held renown in City A’s upper circles, where the Feng heiress’s reputation preceded her.

Feng Xihu ignored her, maintaining her piercing gaze on Guan Yu. After a long silence, she sighed. “I don’t know what grudges you hold against my brother or father, but you’re right. I must choose sides. Give me time, and I’ll give you an answer.”

Her voice turned icy, as if she’d transformed into someone else. Without waiting for a response, she turned and left.

Watching her retreat, Guan Yu mused that Feng Xihu defied rumors—neither an idle socialite nor a hotheaded brat. Her composure in crisis surpassed ordinary people’s. A foreboding struck him: if he ever confronted the Feng family, she’d become a formidable obstacle.

Shaking off the premonition, he focused on the immediate problem—two badly damaged cars. He called Jia Bo, an expert in vehicle repairs. When Jia arrived, Guan Yu handed him a card. “There’s about 200,000 here. Restore both cars perfectly. Contact me if more funds are needed.”

He then phoned Pan Taisheng to arrange returning Feng Xihu’s car to the Feng estate. Surprisingly, Pan showed no anger upon learning his beloved vehicle was damaged, even comforting Guan Yu.

With affairs settled, Lan Yu drove Guan Yu back to Qiaoyuan District in her massive SUV.

At home, the women had improved their habits since Guan Yu’s earlier reprimand. The house now stayed clean, with meals prepared on time. Even the formerly game-obsessed Amei and Xue Jing had become diligent.

Lan Yu, familiar with everyone, joined them in Zhang Han’s bedroom. Zhang enthusiastically tried recruiting her into their gaming squad, but Lan Yu found the pixelated sword-swinging dull. “It’s just a little figure hacking away. What’s the fun?”

Zhang huffed. “Like playing lute for a cow!”

During dinner, Lan Yu coyly revealed her father teased her as a “leftover woman,” hinting she wanted to stay. Guan Yu tactfully deflected—at seventeen, she seemed too young despite her allure.

That night, Lan Yu wheedled her way into sharing his room. Reluctantly, Guan Yu relented, knowing her presence tested his restraint.

Meanwhile, Feng Xihu locked herself in her room, refusing meals or baths. Her brother Feng Shaoye abandoned his dalliances to check on her. “Tell me what’s wrong. I’ll fix it.”

“You can’t,” she snapped.

Undeterred, he boasted, “Nothing in this city is beyond me.”

She finally emerged. Sitting on the circular bed in the hall, she demanded, “What’s between you and Guan Yu?”

**Chapter 2139: A Greater Backer**

“Our feud runs deep,” Feng Shaoye admitted. “Even if I stopped opposing him, he’d still come for me. Huayu Group already wars with our family’s enterprises. Without our powerful backers, Feng Holdings would’ve collapsed.”

Realizing reconciliation was impossible, Feng Xihu retreated to her room, silent and brooding.

The next day, Guan Yu visited Jin Hua with Lan Yu. Mid-conversation, Hou Jinshun called urgently: “Guan Yu! Ling’er’s missing—she didn’t show for work, and her phone’s off!”

Rushing to Pan Taisheng’s apartment, they found her gone. Guan Yu mobilized allies to search, suspecting his martial arts sister Shimei had kidnapped Ling’er to lure out her parents.

Driving frantically to the Qing family’s hideout, Guan Yu arrived to find Mr. Qing panicking. Shimei had called using Ling’er’s phone, demanding their location.

As dusk fell, a black van approached. Shimei emerged, gripping the dazed Ling’er. “Old fool,” she sneered. “Thanks to your daughter, I found you.”

“What did you do to her?” Mr. Qing cried.

Guan Yu’s voice turned lethal. “If she’s harmed, you’ll pay with your life.”

**Chapter 2140: Severe Injuries**

Shimei scoffed. “Why side with them? For this girl?”

“Wake her now,” Guan Yu ordered. “Or you die here.”

Ling’er stood eerily still, eyes open but unresponsive—likely drugged. Guan Yu’s restraint frayed; though not officially his woman, Ling’er fell under his protection. The standoff crackled with tension as night descended.
