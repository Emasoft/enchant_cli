“Danger?” Dongfang Mu was taken aback, having originally assumed Guan Yu's trip to Taiwan involved mere business affairs. But now it seemed otherwise?

Guan Yu nodded without reservation. “That man is currently my subordinate, but he’s recently shown rebellious inclinations. His influence in Taiwan rivals mine here in N City. This trip aims to eliminate him.” His tone carried grave resolve.

Understanding dawned on Dongfang Mu. “In that case, we’ll drop the matter! By the way, should I send some men to accompany you?”

“Unnecessary.” Guan Yu shook his head. Though Wan Qianshan possessed considerable capability, he remained firmly within Guan Yu’s control. His true concern lay with Li Xi, who had departed earlier—he feared for her safety.

At that moment, a radiant young woman pushed through the door.

Clad in a pale pink floral dress with cascading raven locks and devoid of makeup, her delicate features exuded pristine elegance.

Who would have imagined the Dongfang family harbored such a refined maiden? Rare indeed!

Having only encountered Dongfang Huowu’s nonconformist style before, Guan Yu had presumed all Dongfang women shared her eccentricity. This vision of purity now captivated him like a rare artifact.

Yet the longer he gazed, the stronger his déjà vu grew. After prolonged scrutiny, he gasped: “You’re… Dongfang Huowu? Heavens! I…”

**Chapter 1031: Your Feet Have… Character**

Presently, Dongfang Huowu appeared charming and graceful. Though not classically beautiful, her refined demeanor starkly contrasted her former punkish image. Rumors branded the Dongfang heiress a perpetual spinster—witnesses to this transformation would surely gape in disbelief!

Both Guan Yu and Jiang Ziqi stood dumbfounded by the metamorphosis.

Noting their astonishment, Dongfang Huowu preened inwardly. *Serves these foul men right for belittling me as some rebel!*

“Well, Guan Yu, isn’t my sister lovely?” Dongfang Mu teased.

“Lovely indeed!” Guan Yu’s dazed response stemmed not from infatuation, but the jarring contrast between her former and current selves—like Tang Bohu selecting Qiuxiang amidst foliage, where a single blossom appears doubly enchanting.

“Brother, Mother wants him to accompany me grocery shopping!” Huowu announced shyly from the doorway.

*Grocery shopping?* Guan Yu blinked. Since when did the illustrious Dongfang clan require market visits? Sending their heiress? Preposterous!

Dongfang Mu chuckled knowingly. “Perfect timing. Guan Yu can purchase accompaniments for our drinking session.”

Unable to refuse, Guan Yu turned to Jiang Ziqi: “Join me.”

“I’ll stay and keep Brother Dongfang company over tea.” Jiang Ziqi declined hastily—playing third wheel to Dongfang Mu’s matchmaking? Unthinkable!

Though sensing something amiss, Guan Yu couldn’t pinpoint the issue.

“Drive or walk?” Guan Yu queried in the courtyard. Local village shops offered fresh produce, but Dongfang Hai interjected: “Visit the city for better quality.”

The family steward produced a discreet Audi Q7. Settling into the passenger seat, Guan Yu bid farewell to Dongfang Mu as they sped away.

“Finally departed,” Dongfang Mu exhaled in relief.

Dongfang Hai wiped his brow, solemnity melting. “May Guan Yu take a liking to our formidable lady.”

“What nonsense!” Sun Hairong yanked her husband’s ear. “Eager to discard our daughter?”

“No! Never!” The patriarch winced. “Company’s present—spare my dignity!”

Jiang Ziqi tactfully averted his gaze, reassessing the Dongfang clan. Unlike patriarchal elites enforcing male dominance, here stood equals—a stark contrast to the Song family’s notorious marriage-alliance strategies.

“Must you prop your feet up? The odor!” Guan Yu groaned in the SUV, realizing attire couldn’t mask true nature. Huowu’s boots-on-dashboard posture confirmed this.

*Leopards never change their spots!*

“Odor?” Huowu glared. “I’m fragrant head-to-toe!”

Guan Yu smirked. “Is that so? All I detect is…”

“You dare call me smelly?!”

“Sniff yourself.”

“Think me fool enough to smell my own toes?” Despite retorting, she retracted her legs, grumbling about torturous high heels.

“Never worn heels before?” Realization struck—her punk phase likely excluded skirts, let alone pumps. The dress? Probably her mother’s vintage.

“So what?” she snapped under his scrutiny.

“Nothing unusual,” he placated, though mentally cataloging her as sartorial anomaly.

“What’s that look for?!” she demanded as his expression grew peculiar.

When Guan Yu ignored her to hum with the radio, Huowu erupted: “How dare you disregard me!” Sinking teeth into his forearm, she bit viciously.

“Madwoman! I’m driving! Damn, that hurts!” Though tempted to shake her off, road safety prevailed. Fortunately, deserted highways and skilled handling averted disaster.

**Chapter 1032: The Fierce Woman**

After serpentining onto the highway, Huowu released her jaw grip. Guan Yu’s stony face masked pain-numbed agony—a fifteen-minute mauling left his arm purpled.

“That’ll teach you!” Huowu brandished a triumphant fist.

Guan Yu maintained stoic silence. Previously avoiding her from distaste, now sheer self-preservation dictated distance. Shopping and departure dominated his thoughts.

Parking at a supermarket, Guan Yu swiftly gathered vegetables while Huowu bolted to snack aisles. Completing purchases, he waited until her frantic exit, chasing a thief who brandished a stolen purse.

Bystanders ignored her cries. The thief vanished into an alley, Huowu giving chase despite heels and skirt.

Guan Yu observed amusedly from the car before strolling to the alley’s mouth.

“Bold bitch, following me here!” The thief produced a knife as two accomplices emerged. “Tonight’s bedwarmer secured!”

Terror whitened Huowu’s face. *Where’s Guan Yu?!*

Leaning casually against the wall, Guan Yu cleared his throat. The thugs sneered: “Interfering, brat?”

“Merely passing through.” He raised placating hands.

“Guan Yu! You disappoint me!” Huowu seethed.

As the knife-wielder lunged, a shadow flashed. Two agonized screams later, all assailants curled fetal, groin regions bloodied.

“What did you do?!” Huowu gaped.

“Permanently neutered them,” Guan Yu shrugged.

Sirens approached. Recognizing his brother-in-law among victims, Officer Wang produced handcuffs. “Assaulting my relative? Arrest them!”

“They’re thieves!” Huowu protested.

“Save it for the station!” the officer barked. A junior cop apologized while cuffing Guan Yu, who placated Huowu’s struggles.

“Why submit?!” she raged in the cruiser.

“Consider it cultural immersion,” he deadpanned.

**Chapter 1033: Jailhouse Blues**

At the station, Wang’s cronies fabricated charges until Guan Yu revealed his NSA credentials. Panicked superiors released them with profuse apologies.

“You… work for the government?!” Huowu gaped during the ride back.

“National Security Advisor. Disappointed?”

Her subsequent silence lasted until home, where she suddenly declared: “Teach me fighting!”

“Why?”

“Next time I’ll handle scum myself!”

Guan Yu sighed—this tempestuous woman’s whims proved as unpredictable as typhoons.
