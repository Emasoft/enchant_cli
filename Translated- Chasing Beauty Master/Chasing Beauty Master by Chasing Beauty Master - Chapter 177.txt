The voice was calm and casual, yet exploded through the crowd like thunder from clear skies.

Lin Lin was especially startled, for the speaker was none other than Guan Yu, whom she had just met that day. Her peripheral glance caught Yang Yang’s livid expression as he stared at Guan Yu, making her heart sink.

She hurried to Guan Yu’s side, tugging his sleeve. “Guan Yu, why are you here? You can’t afford to offend these two,” she whispered urgently.

Guan Yu smiled faintly without responding.

Seeing his nonchalance, Lin Lin fumed inwardly. She turned to Li Xi, murmuring, “He’s drunk, but you’re sober! How could you let him act recklessly? Get him away before Young Master Yang loses his temper. I’ll handle the rest.”

Li Xi remained silent, her eyes gleaming with unreadable light as she watched Guan Yu.

Frustrated by their composure, Lin Lin grew increasingly anxious.

Yang Yi himself froze momentarily before erupting in rage. Whirling around, he sought the audacious fool who dared disrespect him. Already in foul humor, he wouldn’t mind sending another person to the hospital for months.

But when he saw Guan Yu, his face twisted as if he’d swallowed a fly, fury flooding out like breached damwater. He never expected to encounter Guan Yu here, let alone have him deliberately provoke trouble. To Yang Yi’s mind, this was clearly intentional harassment.

Veins bulging on his forehead, Yang Yi glared murderously. “You?!” he spat through clenched teeth.

Guan Yu belched lightly, his lips quirking. “Surprised to see me? Don’t think knowing me excuses ignoring my words. Will you apologize, or shall I kick it out of you?”

“Screw your damn eggs!” Yang Yi roared, fist clenching as he swung at Guan Yu’s face.

He’d endured enough of this upstart who thought connections to Zhao Zilong made him invincible. Today, he’d teach this arrogant fool a lesson.

But before the punch landed, Yang Yang grabbed his arm, shaking his head in warning.

Though crimson-eyed with rage, Yang Yi checked himself. He never defied his elder brother, knowing Yang Yang’s superior cunning and ruthlessness.

“You know each other?” Lin Lin asked incredulously.

Guan Yu shrugged lazily. “Hardly. Second meeting. The circumstances remain equally unpleasant.” His mocking gaze swept over both Yang brothers.

Lin Lin’s expression turned odd, detecting clear malice beneath Guan Yu’s amusement. Had they clashed before? Yet she dismissed the thought—had there been prior conflict, Yang Yang’s influence would’ve crushed Guan Yu already.

As she puzzled, Guan Yu lit a cigarette. “Hurry up and apologize,” he complained. “I’ve dinner plans. You always pick such inconvenient times.”

Yang Yang’s eyelid twitched violently. “Do you truly think us so easily bullied?” he said coldly. “Must you meddle in every affair?”

“Who says this doesn’t concern me?” Guan Yu narrowed his eyes. “His petty grudges mean nothing. But attacking an innocent waitress so brutally? That I won’t tolerate. I despise men who strike women. He will apologize.”

Having followed Li Xi out after Lin Lin left, Guan Yu had witnessed Yang Yi’s cruelty toward the staff. With existing enmity and Zhao Zilong’s warnings about Yang Yang’s schemes, he saw no reason to hold back. Moreover, this was Lin Lin’s establishment—though new acquaintances, he felt compelled to defend her people.

“You’re insane! Countless men hit women—why care?!” Yang Yi retorted.

“Others I ignore. But you? That I’ll rectify.” Guan Yu waved impatiently. “Apologize. Now.”

“Apologize my ass!” Yang Yi snarled, fist trembling.

His answer came as a blur—an Armani loafer filling his vision before agony exploded in his gut. The impact launched him like cannonball across the floor. As he struggled up, another kick sent him sprawling, pain nearly knocking him unconscious.

Guan Yu raised his foot again when Yang Yang’s enraged shout froze the air: “Guan Yu! How dare you?!”

The suspended foot paused briefly before stomping down ruthlessly. Yang Yi’s eyes rolled back as darkness claimed him.

“Quit pretending,” Guan Yu scoffed. “Get up. I want that apology.” He drew back for another kick, halted by Lin Lin.

Her eyes wide with disbelief at his direct brutality, she interposed. “Stop! No more!” she pleaded urgently.

Guan Yu relented, turning to Yang Yang with a grin. “Your brother grew up in military compounds? What a weakling.”

Even Yang Yang’s composure shattered. “The Yangs fear no provocateurs!” he spat, eyes bloodshot. “When this reaches Patriarch Zhao, you’ll regret—”

“Regret what?” Guan Yu cut him off, addressing Lin Lin. “Sis, seems that waitress won’t get her apology. Let’s collect in kicks then.” Another brutal stomp landed on Yang Yi.

Chapter 437: The Consequences of Overestimating One’s Cleverness

The suddenness and force of Guan Yu’s kick left even nearby Lin Lin helpless to intervene. Yang Yi awoke screaming from unconsciousness, fresh agony overwhelming him.

Yang Yang’s eyelid spasmed violently. “Excellent,” he said through gritted teeth. “No one can save you now.”

Guan Yu shrugged, awaiting developments. Lin Lin clapped a hand over her mouth, aghast yet secretly satisfied. Though cathartic, she knew this spelled disaster.

Meeting Guan Yu’s unconcerned gaze, she sighed. The fool remained oblivious, casually remarking to Lin Lin: “Guess we’ll compensate that waitress with extra benefits.”

Lin Lin nearly groaned. Did he truly not grasp the severity? Leaning close, she whispered urgently: “Leave now. I’ll handle this. Worst case, they shut down my club. I’ll rebuild.”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Relax. His trifling power can’t touch us.”

“Trifling?!” Lin Lin rolled her eyes. “Newborn calves fear no tigers—until devoured.”

Yang Yang sneered, already envisioning Guan Yu’s downfall. Observing his moaning brother, he dialed for reinforcements. Let Zhao Zilong try protecting this troublemaker now!

But before completing the call, Tian Xun materialized before him.

Both Yangs startled. Guan Yu blinked—how had the Zhongnanhai special forces bodyguard entered this members-only area? Then again, elite operatives had their methods.

“You again?” Yang Yang glowered. “What now?”

Tian Xun stated tonelessly: “Don’t waste effort. While I’m here, you won’t take him.”

“You saw him assault my brother!” Yang Yang snapped. “I’ll find superiors to override your orders!”

“Unless the General revokes my mission, I stand firm.” The bodyguard remained impassive.

Smirking, Yang Yang stepped aside to call reinforcements and inform Zhao Zilong about Guan Yu’s “reckless womanizing brawl.” Let witnesses corroborate. This time, Guan Yu would fall.

Guan Yu, however, remained unperturbed. Zhao Zilong needed him to cure Zhao Jing’er—protection was guaranteed. Nodding gratefully to Tian Xun, he said: “Thanks, though unnecessary.”

“Merely a reminder.” With that, Tian Xun vanished as mysteriously as he’d appeared.

Lin Lin whispered: “Who was that? Not a member.”

“A friend,” Guan Yu evaded. He couldn’t reveal the bodyguard.

Her sharp eyes narrowed. Yang Yang’s wariness toward Guan Yu intrigued her—what inspired such caution? The mysterious “friend” seemed more like hired protection. Women’s intuition proved uncanny.

Meanwhile, Yang Yang’s renewed confidence puzzled her. Moving to Li Xi, she pressed: “What’s Guan Yu’s real background?”

“A rural college student,” Li Xi answered flatly, though her eyes betrayed fascination.

“What?!” Lin Lin gaped. Before she could process this, Yang Yang returned, sneering at Guan Yu: “Your end comes. No salvation this time.”

Guan Yu exhaled smoke lazily. “Know the price of false cleverness?”

Yang Yang scoffed at what he deemed last bravado. Guan Yu simply turned to the women: “Sis, our drinking mood was ruined. More wine?”

Lin Lin rolled her eyes. “Drink with Xi Xi. I’ve lost all taste.”

To everyone’s surprise, Li Xi wordlessly returned to their private lounge. Chuckling, Guan Yu followed.

Yang Yang finally noticed Li Xi’s ethereal beauty, jealousy flaring. Why did stunning women flock to this nobody? Even now, Guan Yu wined with beauties while his brother writhed in pain!

As Guan Yu departed, he called over his shoulder: “About that price for false cleverness? Let me enlighten you before you leave—the consequence is being a damned fool.”

Lin Lin barely stifled laughter. Onlookers’ expressions twitched. Yang Yang’s face turned granite.

Chapter 438: Where’s Your Hand?!

Back at the lounge, Guan Yu downed wine heedless of impending storm. Li Xi studied him curiously. “This is your military connection?” she finally asked.

Lin Lin facepalmed. Did nothing faze them? At least pretend concern! But the pair drank on, oblivious.

Yang Yang burned with resentment. His brother groaned on the floor while his rival enjoyed fine wine with celestial beauty. The injustice galled him—a decorated scion outshone by some rural student!

Guan Yu suddenly turned, grinning. “Oh, about that cleverness consequence? For your departure contemplation—it’s called reaping what idiots sow.” With that, he left Yang Yang trembling in rage.
