“If he goes in there to borrow money without being a resident, would they even lend to him? Pure delusion,” Ling Su thought to himself.

At that moment, the door opened. Ling Su quickly hid among the nearby crowd as Lin Chen emerged with a beaming smile, carrying a large bag.

Ling Su’s eyes widened. If that bag held silver, there had to be at least fifty or sixty taels inside. Could this fool have actually succeeded in borrowing money?

When the beautiful woman handed the silver to Lin Chen earlier, he had grinned so widely his face nearly split. “Thank you, fair lady! Since you’ve helped me so generously, may I boldly ask for your name?”

“Young Master Lin, your question is indeed rather bold. Forgive me, but I cannot disclose that. Is there anything else I can assist you with?” Though refusing, her tone remained gentle.

Lin Chen hadn’t expected borrowing silver to be so effortless—and from a beauty, no less! This place was marvelous. Jubilant, he strode out with a hundred taels of silver.

Ling Su watched in bewilderment. Lin Chen wasn’t a local—why would they lend him so much? It defied belief.

Lin Chen returned to the dice tables, standing again beside the woman. He slammed his bag onto the table with a clang, thinking, *Damn it! With this silver, I’ll gamble big tonight and win back every last tael I lost!*

“Back so soon? And with quite the haul,” the woman remarked coldly.

“Of course. The fair lady recognized my noble bearing at a glance—her discernment is unmatched,” Lin Chen declared haughtily. “I meant to take less, but she insisted on giving more. How could I refuse such hospitality?”

Upon hearing this, Zhang Degui exclaimed, “You borrowed that much? That’s excessive! A little gambling is enough—don’t go overboard.”

“No matter. It’s petty coin.”

“Truly, wealth breeds arrogance. The rich are different,” the old man muttered.

The woman glanced at Lin Chen and boasted, “While you were gone, see how much I’ve won? Impressed?”

Lin Chen saw her silver pile had indeed grown. Chuckling, he said, “You’re remarkable! Come—this round, I’ll bet big first. Anyone care to follow?”

He tossed twenty taels onto “Large,” reckless in his newfound wealth. *I’m leaving tomorrow anyway. By the time they track me down, I’ll be long gone. This silver’s as good as free!*

*Free money means reckless fun!* Besides, to recoup his losses, he needed high stakes.

The woman curled her lip and whispered, “Brainless fool. This round’s clearly ‘Small,’ yet you bet ‘Large.’”

“No more bets!” the dealer shouted. The dice revealed “Small”—another win for the woman.

**Chapter 4367: Unlucky Streak**

In mere moments, Lin Chen’s twenty taels vanished. At this rate, his hundred taels would last only five rounds.

“You’re too skilled. I’ll follow your bets from now on,” Lin Chen said nervously, his confidence shaken.

“Smart choice. My prowess is beyond your comprehension,” the woman replied, her arrogance surpassing his.

Ling Su crept behind Lin Chen. Round after round, twenty taels disappeared each time until Lin Chen’s bag neared emptiness. Panic set in.

“Cursed luck! Even following her bets, I lose! What’s happening?” Lin Chen cursed. Though the silver felt like stolen goods, such waste was intolerable.

“Lin Chen! The others wait at the city gates! Stop gambling and notify them!” Ling Su tapped his shoulder.

“Get off! Can’t you see I’m busy?” Lin Chen snapped without turning.

“Night approaches. Delay further, and it’ll be too late,” Ling Su pressed. “Lose all that silver, and how will you explain yourself?”

The words jolted Lin Chen awake. *He’s right—I must stop. But my silver’s gone…*

Turning to Ling Su, he ordered, “Mind your business! Go tell the group we’re staying here. I’ve secured rooms.”

“I’ll gamble too if I please!” Ling Su retorted, though he’d already lost his last coin at a guessing game. He eyed the loan room, wondering if he could borrow more.

“Fine! I’ll go myself!” Lin Chen stormed off—not to the gates, but back to borrow again. *I need more silver, or we’ll starve tonight!*

Reentering the room, he found the beauty packing. “Fair lady, what are you doing?”

“My shift’s ended. I’m preparing to rest. Have you come to borrow again, Young Master Lin?”

“Yes… My luck turned sour. Lost all I borrowed.” Lin Chen’s earlier arrogance crumbled into desperation.

The woman studied him. After his first loan, she’d sent someone to verify his address—still awaiting confirmation. By protocol, she couldn’t refuse yet. “How much?”

“Another hundred taels. Less won’t suffice,” Lin Chen said, suppressing a grin. *Perfect—borrow freely and vanish at dawn!*

He almost laughed aloud. *I used a fake name! Two hundred free taels! What a delightfully lax establishment!*

“Will this counter close tonight? Where to borrow after hours?”

“We reopen tomorrow. The gambling hall closes at midnight—tenants upstairs need quiet. Now, sign here.”

After signing, Lin Chen headed out. At the door, he turned. “Need an escort to your quarters?”

“No need. My brother will fetch me.”

*Suit yourself.* Lin Chen hurried off, preoccupied.

Outside town, Guan Yu and Siqi wandered aimlessly. “Could Lin Chen still be lost?” Guan Yu wondered.

“He must’ve found the place. Perhaps the message hasn’t reached us,” Siqi said.

Meanwhile, Wang Jun and Aze haggled with horse traders. “Just sell them already!” Wang Jun grumbled.

“Patience! Compare prices first!” Aze insisted.

**Chapter 4368: Empty Stomachs**

Approaching the city gates, Lin Chen fretted over his losses. *If many scammers like me exist, how does this place stay afloat?*

*Maybe I should flee tonight with the silver—find another inn.*

He arrived as Aze sold horses. “Where’s Guan Yu? Hand over the proceeds.”

“Stop!” Aze blocked him. “Guan Yu entrusted this to me. The silver goes through him.”

Lin Chen scoffed. “Fine! If the deputy captain’s authority means nothing here, I’ll take it up with Guan Yu!”

At the inn, the group marveled. “Lin Chen outdid himself! Gambling and lodging in one spot—brilliant!”

When Guan Yu and Siqi arrived, she frowned. “How can anyone rest in this racket?”

At dinner, Lin Chen approached Guan Yu. “Aze sold the horses but told me to collect from you!”

“Here—fifty taels.” Guan Yu tossed a pouch.

Lin Chen retreated to eat, avoiding Siqi. Guan Yu noted the odd distance between them.

When Ling Su saw the meal—pickles and steamed buns—he smashed his bowl. “Lin Chen! Master gave us gold for proper meals! Who can fill their belly with this slop?!”

Others shared his resentment but stayed silent. Lin Chen had squandered their funds, including gold worth over two hundred taels. With camels to buy tomorrow, he’d rationed harshly.

“Eat it or buy your own food!” Lin Chen snapped.

Guan Yu smirked, chewing his bun. *Finally—the consequences of Lin Chen’s greed approach.*

“You gambled away everything, even borrowed silver! How dare you feed us scraps?!” Ling Su shouted. “I’ll report this to Master!”

Lin Chen brandished his chopsticks. “I’m in charge here! Complain again, and you’ll sleep outside!”

“You think your fake name protects you? I’ll expose your loans! Let’s see you repay then!”

**Chapter 4369: Direct Threats**

Lin Chen paled. *He’d really do it! Two hundred taels of debt—I’m ruined!*

“Brother Ling Su, don’t be hasty…” Lin Chen forced a placating tone. *I must stop him—at any cost.*
