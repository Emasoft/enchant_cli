Qi Zhi saw a piece of skin inside the glass case and nodded, "This should be the real thing. At least it looks convincing." He took out his phone to take pictures but was stopped by Old Wu.

"Brother, don't blame me for being difficult," Old Wu said. "I can't let you take photos. This item is reproducible. If leaked photos reveal sensitive details, its value will plummet."

Hou Jinshun chimed in, "He's right. At the Yang Family Auction House, they search everyone before entry. No recording devices are allowed. No photos either. Don't complain, Qi Zhi."

Qi Zhi grimaced in frustration. "But my friend needs to see this before lending me the money. Otherwise, I can't afford it."

Old Wu shook his head helplessly. "Then forget it. If all else fails, bring your friend here to inspect it. That's the only way." As he spoke, he warily eyed Hou Jinshun and relocked the safe.

"Now that you've seen it," Old Wu continued, "I'll keep my word. If you're serious about buying, I'll lower the price by another million. Not a penny less."

Qi Zhi’s heart itched with greed. He pursed his lips, finding it laughable that the old man only budged a mere million despite the grand fuss.

The urge to kill the old man and seize the treasure map surged within him. With the map, he could effortlessly sell it for tens of millions and become wealthy overnight. Yet he restrained himself—Hou Jinshun’s presence made it impossible. Such an act would ruin his reputation and future prospects.

Suppressing his thoughts, Qi Zhi said, "I'll contact my friend again. If necessary, I'll have him come personally."

As he walked out, Hou Jinshun watched his retreating figure with unease. Though their acquaintance was brief, Qi Zhi’s secretive behavior—taking calls in private—struck him as odd. Was he afraid of being overheard?

But people had their quirks. Hou Jinshun dismissed the thought after brief consideration. He’d come today at Guan Yu’s request to verify Qi Zhi’s sincerity about purchasing the map. It seemed genuine, though Qi Zhi appeared to lack funds and sought loans.

Earlier, Guan Yu had urged Hou Jinshun to investigate Qi Zhi’s background. Checks revealed Qi Zhi was a jianghu wanderer with numerous eclectic connections. Hou Jinshun saw no need for deeper probing—everyone had a past. He befriended others based on instinct, distancing himself if their character proved lacking over time.

This approach had earned Hou Jinshun wide social connections, amplified by his position as manager of Huaye Club. Over the years, he’d even formed a small gang with admiring youths. Today’s oddities aside, he resolved to stay cautious around Qi Zhi.

“The skin looks exactly as described—probably genuine,” Qi Zhi reported over the phone. “But the old man refuses photos, citing reproducibility.”

“If it looks right, it’s likely authentic,” the voice replied. “What’s the price?”

“He’ll only drop another million. Nineteen million total.”

“Damn! Just a million? That’s worthless!”

“What’s your plan?” Qi Zhi pressed, indifferent to the decision.

After a pause, the voice said, “Leave it. Now that we know the old man has it, I’ll inspect it myself later.”

Qi Zhi detected distrust—unsurprising, given the sum involved. The fear of him absconding with the money or map was reasonable. Better to risk personal inspection than be swindled.

Returning, Qi Zhi faced Old Wu’s questioning gaze. Hou Jinshun teased, “Must you take calls in the bathroom? Fond of the stench?”

Qi Zhi chuckled. “My friend values privacy. Wealthy types are like that.”

Hou Jinshun found the explanation plausible. “Will he buy it?”

“Yes, but not yet,” Qi Zhi told Old Wu. “He needs to see it firsthand. Such sums demand caution. He’ll visit later and requests your contact details.”

Old Wu declined. “I’m here daily before 10 AM and after 4 PM. But if another buyer meets my price first, the item goes to them.”

Qi Zhi nodded—without deposits or finalized deals, the seller retained full rights.

After leaving Jinxin Pawnshop, Qi Zhi invited Hou Jinshun to dine, but the latter declined, citing fatigue. They parted ways.

Driving off, Hou Jinshun called Guan Yu. “Saw the skin at Jinxin. It matches the Yang auction’s description. Interested?”

“Price?”

“Twenty million. Qi Zhi claims his friend will buy it.”

“Twenty million’s manageable, but I can’t afford it. Plus, it’d invite trouble. Keep watch—have people monitor Jinxin. Note everyone entering. Let’s identify this mysterious friend.”

“Agreed. I’ll station men there immediately.”

After hanging up, Guan Yu summoned Second Brother Lang, only to find him gambling at Ma Tong’s casino. With Xue Jing, Guan Yu headed there.

Upon arrival, staff recoiled at Guan Yu’s presence.

“Do I look that terrifying?” Guan Yu muttered.

Xue Jing giggled. “They remember your gunfight. Everyone knows you carry weapons. They’d rather avoid trouble.”

Guan Yu sighed. His previous shootout had cemented his fearsome reputation. Ordinary folk now regarded him with wary respect, deeming it safest to keep their distance.

Upstairs, Second Brother Lang’s booming voice echoed. Flanked by beauties, he shouted at a slot machine, “Max bet! Max!”

Guan Yu calculated each spin cost over 20,000 yuan. Yet Second Brother Lang whooped as credits surged, winning over 100,000 yuan in one go.

Annoyed, Guan Yu tapped his shoulder. Ignored, he barked, “Stop playing! We need to talk!”

“Later! I’m busy!” Second Brother Lang retorted, eyes glued to the machine.

Xue Jing whispered, “Let’s tell Yoshiko about his... companions.”

Hearing this, Second Brother Lang spun around, panicked. “Don’t! Fine, let’s talk!” Reluctantly, he peeled himself from the girls.

As Guan Yu turned to leave, Second Brother Lang glared at his back, itching to bite him. Instead, he hurried after them, grumbling about ruined fun.

Outside, Guan Yu laid out his plans while Second Brother Lang sulked, already missing his game.
