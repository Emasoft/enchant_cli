“I’ve already said he’s inferior to Guanyu in every way. Do you want our daughter to abandon a gem and choose trash? Guanyu is taller, handsomer, more skilled in martial arts, and possesses a stronger sense of justice than him…”

“Enough! Must you elevate Guanyu to the status of God or Buddha in your mind? Must he surpass all others in every conceivable trait?”

Wang Xiaorong giggled, “Precisely! Isn’t that how you feel too, Father? Though ‘God’ sounds too ancient, and ‘Buddha’ too plump. Guanyu surpasses them both, hehehe.”

“You’re utterly lost, completely consumed by Guanyu’s shadow. Even if you dislike Young Master Jiang, what about the Luo family’s heir? He’s dashingly handsome, towering in stature, and his father rules a commercial empire. Where else could you find such a match?”

The Demon Lord pressed on, “Moreover, I refuse to let you be entangled in Jianghu’s endless strife. Marrying into wealth would grant you lifelong security and leisure. Isn’t that preferable?”

“Father, how could Luo compare to Guanyu? While wealth matters, Guanyu already possesses vast riches. Most crucially, he can protect me when danger arises.”

Xiaorong continued, “Guanyu’s capabilities dwarf ordinary men’s. I crave Jianghu’s excitement, not placid comfort. Only a formidable man like him can safeguard me when you’re no longer able.”

“What do you mean ‘unable’? I could protect you indefinitely!” the Demon Lord retorted irritably, realizing his daughter’s devotion left no room for others—even himself.

“Because Guanyu will eventually surpass you,” Xiaorong countered with a smile. “His dual cultivation of demonic and martial arts will make him peerless. Have you not heard how he crippled Elder Xiang of Yunqing Sect with a single strike? Even Left Envoy couldn’t achieve that—nor could you!”

The Demon Lord fell silent, unable to refute. Guanyu’s recent feats—defeating a sect elder without using the Imperial Seal—proved his terrifying growth. Rumors of his mysterious combat methods only heightened the concern.

“Speaking of which,” the Demon Lord growled, “I should settle accounts with Guanyu! Attacking our ally Elder Xiang, his senior no less—such audacity!”

Xiaorong chuckled, “That’s Guanyu’s charm—he follows no rules but his heart. But Father, sending men against him would be futile. He shows no mercy to threats. Dispatch a hundred assassins, and a hundred corpses will return.”

“Moreover,” she added pointedly, “Elder Xiang provoked him first at Yunqing Sect. This reflects your poor discipline of subordinates. I should be demanding justice from that meddlesome elder!”

“Justice?” The Demon Lord sneered. “When has Demon Soul Sect ever needed ‘justice’? Let Guanyu overreach, and I’ll personally end him.”

“Why must you antagonize him?” Xiaorong cried. “He’s Yunqing’s rising star—our natural enemy!” the Demon Lord shouted. “His allegiance makes him dangerous. This is precisely why I forbid your union!”

“You don’t understand!” Xiaorong stamped her foot. “Guanyu bows to no one—not even Yunqing! He’ll eventually return to his homeland. I’ll never abandon him!”

The Demon Lord’s temper flared. “That wretched boy exposed two high-level spies upon returning! Were it not for your attachment, I’d have eliminated him long ago!”

As their argument peaked, Left Envoy entered cautiously. “What troubles my lord today? Has the young mistress caused distress again?”

“Who else?” The Demon Lord grumbled. Spotting an escape, Xiaorong brightened. “Brother Zuo! Have you come to watch our family drama?”

“Merely bearing news,” Left Envoy bowed. “A former Black Blood Ridge operative—Yanzao of Yunqing—seeks asylum. He claims prolonged service under the late Blood Lord.”

“Yunqing’s rat dares come here?” Xiaorong scowled. “He nearly got Guanyu killed last time!”

After dismissing his daughter, the Demon Lord examined the limping defector. “Why shouldn’t I execute a useless暴露 spy?”

Yanzao kowtowed desperately. “My lord! Though my cover was blown, I escaped Yunqing’s purge! I beg sanctuary!”

Noticing the swollen ankle, the Demon Lord frowned. “Why hasn’t spiritual healing mended this?”

“Guanyu’s strike carries strange poison,” Yanzao whimpered. “All healing attempts failed. The wound worsens daily.”

Curiosity overcoming disgust, the Demon Lord approached—then recoiled. “By the Nine Hells! Wash that putrid foot before I consider treatment!”

Blushing crimson, Yanzao scrambled to obey. As Left Envoy led him away, the Demon Lord pondered this new variable. Perhaps the crippled traitor still held value...
