Guan Yu naturally harbored no fear toward them. Seeing the other party poised to strike, he remained utterly unperturbed. With a chuckle, he rose to his feet, casting a glance their way. “So your jade pendant is missing? How delightful for you. But even if we had taken it, we wouldn’t return it. What will you do about it?”

“I knew it was you thieves!” The man snarled, “Daring to steal from me? Today, I’ll teach you a lesson!” As he stood closest to Guan Yu, he immediately drew his sword, aiming a strike at him.

Yue Jing had never regarded Guan Yu as a threat, dismissing him as an ordinary fool who needed a harsh lesson to understand his place.

When the blade thrust toward him, Guan Yu casually deflected it with a flick of his hand, sending the sword clattering aside. The assailant froze, stunned that Guan Yu possessed such skill.

“You brat! Didn’t expect you to have some tricks up your sleeve,” Yue Jing spat.

Guan Yu smirked coldly. “Tricks? Even if I were a three-year-old child, dealing with scum like you from the Red Lotus Sect would be child’s play.”

“Senior Brother! They dare insult our Red Lotus Sect!” Lai Lixia hissed, gesticulating wildly. “If we don’t teach them respect today, our sect’s honor will be trampled!”

“For a sect that claims righteousness, your Red Lotus Sect should be ashamed to harbor trash like you,” Guan Yu retorted. “You’re not even worth my effort. To avoid accusations of ganging up, Xiao Zhi and A Ze will handle you. Consider it mercy.”

With that, Guan Yu leisurely resumed his seat, ready to enjoy the spectacle. Having parried Yue Jing’s strike, he sensed the latter’s mediocre cultivation level—Xiao Zhi and A Ze were more than sufficient.

From the sidelines, Guan Yu could also analyze their techniques.

Xiao Zhi and A Ze stood in unison, summoning their magical artifacts. “Today, we’ll see if the Red Lotus Sect’s magic matches their arrogance,” Xiao Zhi declared.

The clash erupted instantly. Xiao Zhi first conjured a defensive barrier around himself using his bronze lock artifact before launching offensive spells—a cautious approach.

“Brazen fools! Today, you’ll learn your place!” Yue Jing barked, momentarily stunned by their artifacts. He hadn’t anticipated these “ordinary” opponents to wield such tools.

Though Xiao Zhi and A Ze’s artifacts weren’t extraordinary, their practicality made them coveted among cultivators. In contrast, Yue Jing and Lai Lixia, despite decent cultivation, only bore standard sect-issued swords—inferior even to the Cloud Azure Sect’s blades, which at least housed spirit-storing gems.

Clearly, the Cloud Azure Sect reigned not only as the martial world’s foremost sect but also its wealthiest. Even their disciples wielded artifacts that smaller sects could scarcely imagine, let alone entrust to juniors. To cultivators, artifacts were treasures to be hoarded and studied in secret.

A quality artifact was indispensable to any cultivator. To forge one, one needed inspiration from existing masterpieces—a luxury these two arrogant Red Lotus disciples, accustomed to bullying within their sect, sorely lacked. Now, their hubris would cost them.

In the skirmish, after several exchanges, A Ze engaged Yue Jing while Xiao Zhi flanked. Though Yue Jing’s swordsmanship outmatched A Ze’s, the latter’s brush artifact provided crucial support.

When Yue Jing and Lai Lixia coordinated their assault, A Ze faltered under their relentless strikes. Only then did Guan Yu realize the purpose of their blades: after casting defensive shields, they closed in with practiced sword forms, more akin to martial artists than cultivators.

Guan Yu laughed. “So the Red Lotus Sect isn’t a proper cultivation sect after all—just a half-breed! Instead of magic, you hack away with swords like common mercenaries!”

Though outmatched, A Ze’s shield absorbed their blows harmlessly. Guan Yu suddenly missed his own legendary “Eggshell Shield”—a peerless defense that even Second only to Wolf had admired. Not only did it block attacks, but it also reflected damage, thwarting all but the mightiest strikes. It had even deflected bullets, astounding everyone.

*If only I could regain that shield…* Guan Yu mused. His thoughts then turned to Second only to Wolf. The Red Lotus duo’s desperation suggested their lost pendant held real importance. Since Xiao Zhi had seen Yue Jing wearing it earlier, its disappearance pointed to one culprit…

Scanning the area subtly, Guan Yu found no trace—Second only to Wolf’s stealth was unmatched.

Meanwhile, A Ze neared his limit under the Red Lotus pair’s onslaught—until Xiao Zhi’s long-prepared spell erupted. Dark clouds gathered, and twin bolts of lightning as thick as bowls struck Yue Jing and Lai Lixia.

Screaming, they collapsed, twitching like beheaded chickens. Their shields had mitigated the damage, sparing them severe injury. Xiao Zhi and A Ze held back, unwilling to kill fellow cultivators.

Recovering moments later, Yue Jing glared venomously. “Cloud Azure Sect dogs! This isn’t over!” He and Lai Lixia scrambled away as Xiao Zhi mockingly raised his artifact.

“Fools,” Xiao Zhi snorted, rejoining A Ze.

“Well fought,” Guan Yu praised. “Though A Ze bore the brunt.”

“A necessary strategy,” A Ze replied. “Holding them off let Xiao Zhi unleash his spell. Teamwork ensured victory.”

Guan Yu nodded. The Red Lotus duo’s sword skills would have overwhelmed them individually. By tanking their attacks, A Ze created an opening—a lesson in coordination.

“A Ze,” Guan Yu mused, “if you learned blade techniques, you could protect Xiao Zhi while he casts, like a guardian.”

A Ze chuckled dryly. “Unlike you, I’m no prodigy. I poured every ounce of spiritual energy into that shield. Without it, I’d be mincemeat.”

As a pure cultivator, A Ze lacked martial training—a limitation Guan Yu noted. Yet hybrid cultivation, as the Red Lotus pair demonstrated, held merit. Though building physical prowess took time, their sect’s approach revealed a solution to cultivators’ close-combat weakness.

“Their desperation over that pendant suggests its importance,” Guan Yu remarked.

Xiao Zhi nodded. “The Red Lotus Sect’s treasure—the Jade Bagua—is said to be a mystical artifact. Its exact powers are unknown, but its loss explains their panic.”

“Perhaps it’s key to locating Patriarch Meng Hua’s ruins,” A Ze added. “Why else would they entrust it to these two?”

Guan Yu agreed. “Yet those fools lost it. Amusing—but now the Red Lotus Sect will blame us.”

“Let them come,” A Ze declared staunchly. “Innocence fears no accusation.”

Guan Yu silently resolved to confront Second only to Wolf. If he’d stolen the Jade Bagua, returning it preemptively would avert greater strife.

Siqi, silent throughout, lingered like a phantom. After tea, the group rode to Duobao Mountain, tethering their horses at the base before ascending the lone trail—well-trodden, as evidenced by trampled foliage.

“This path sees regular use,” Guan Yu observed, noting the packed earth.

“It’s a shortcut to Jiangze,” Xiao Zhi explained. “Merchants without heavy cargo prefer it over the main road.”

At the mountainside, Xiao Zhi described two notorious “Demon Caves”—said to imprison fallen celestial beasts. The tale unsettled Siqi, stirring childhood memories of unjust confinement.

“What crime condemns them here?” she whispered. “Why two caves? Do immortals carve prisons so easily?” Her voice trembled with unspoken anguish, the story’s echoes too personal to dismiss.
