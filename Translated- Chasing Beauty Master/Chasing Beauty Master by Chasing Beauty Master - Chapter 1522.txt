The Demon Lord sighed helplessly as he looked at his beloved daughter. Her thoughts were entirely consumed by Guan Yu these days – ever since meeting him, she'd become completely smitten.

"Very well, I'll permit you to go," he conceded, "but I must assign guards to watch over you discreetly. Should danger arise, they can intervene immediately. If you refuse this condition, the matter ends here. You're aware Sun Lianzi of the Red Lotus Sect remains furious about recent events. Their forces have already destroyed several of our Demon Soul Sect outposts. Should their agents target you..."

Wang Xiaorong nodded, recognizing her father's concern. "As you wish, Father."

Three days later, Guan Yu examined the compact crossbow in his hands with satisfaction. Wang Jun remarked beside him, "Our efforts weren't in vain. This first prototype exceeds expectations."

"Indeed," Guan Yu chuckled, testing the weapon's weight. "Its power rivals my pistol. The test shot earlier penetrated thirty meters through solid oak. These specially weighted bolts maintain deadly accuracy within fifty paces – perfect for Xiaorong's protection."

Wang Jun's eyes gleamed as he handled the weapon. "This compact marvel matches your Desert Eagle's firepower. Remarkable craftsmanship."

"Patience," Guan Yu smiled, noticing his friend's covetous glance. "I'll gather materials during our next expedition to forge one for you."

"See that you do," Wang Jun jested. "I'll be pestering you daily until–"

Their banter halted as Elder Wang burst into the workshop, eyes immediately locking onto the crossbow. "Guan Yu! Might I examine this marvel?"

"By all means," Guan Yu handed over the weapon. "The folding mechanism allows compact storage, while the jade-inlaid grip ensures steady aim."

Elder Wang marveled at the dark metal frame gleaming with bronze accents. "This white cordage – what material is this?"

"An exceptional beast tendon I acquired," Guan Yu explained. "Should we find superior sinew later, replacement is simple."

Eager to demonstrate, the group relocated outdoors. Guan Yu indicated a distant tree. "That borehole marks my thirty-meter test. Let's attempt fifty paces now."

Chapter 3947: Envy

Elder Wang's hands trembled with excitement as he aimed. The released bolt became a blurred streak, punching through distant bark with a resounding crack. Dead leaves rained down as the old cultivator stared in awe. "Incredible! This could challenge even Nascent Soul experts!"

Wang Jun grinned. "Guan Yu's inventions often defy expectations. With this, fifty-meter precision becomes child's play."

"Seventy meters remains feasible," Guan Yu calculated, retrieving the deeply embedded bolt. "Human targets would fare worse than timber."

Elder Wang reluctantly returned the weapon. "If Cloud Azure Sect equipped all disciples with these... our martial prowess would become legendary."

Guan Yu shrugged. "This prototype uses rare materials. Standard versions will still surpass conventional bows." His thoughts drifted to Sect Leader Xuan Ming's hidden agenda – the meteorite iron stores and potential magical artifacts.

Chapter 3948: Direct Approach

Meanwhile, Sect Leader Xuan Ming arrived at Left Peak Hall, accepting Elder Xiang's tea invitation. After savoring the bitter brew, he produced a metallic fragment. "Meteorite iron – the holy grail of artifact forging. Yours to keep, provided..."

Elder Xiang's eyes narrowed. "Provided what?"

"That you honor your wager with Guan Yu. The blood toxin purification for Xiao Zhi."

The hall's atmosphere chilled. "That was mere jest!" Elder Xiang protested. "Sacrificing fifty years' cultivation for some tainted disciple?"

Xuan Ming's voice turned steely. "The entire sect witnessed your defeat. Would you have us both become laughingstocks?" He placed the iron shard decisively on the table. "Reputation matters, Junior Brother. For Cloud Azure's honor..."

Chapter 3949: No Recourse

"Consider this," Xuan Ming pressed as Elder Xiang seethed. "Master Zheng has served faithfully for decades. Elder Ruo guarantees Xiao Zhi's innocence. Must we question our own?"

Elder Xiang's fist clenched around the meteorite iron. "And if I refuse?"

"You won't." The sect leader's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Not when artifact-forging glory awaits. Complete the purification, and greater prizes may follow..."

The unspoken threat hung heavy as teacups cooled. Somewhere beyond the peaks, Guan Yu's crossbow bolt quivered in its target – a silent promise of revolutions to come.
