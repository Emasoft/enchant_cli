Everyone believed the treasure map was genuine because they were convinced of the treasure's existence. The Yang family's auction had exploded in popularity, becoming a sensational event. As one of the top auction houses in all of China, it was truly overwhelmed this time—so many attendees arrived that the venue couldn't accommodate them all.

The Yang family was scrambling to devise solutions. Many people resorted to every possible means to establish connections, hoping to secure a spot through the Yangs' influence. Old Master Yang received over a hundred calls daily, all pleading for seats. The Yang household was thrown into chaos until they finally conceived a plan: each participant, whether an individual or group, could only send one representative into the auction hall.

This freed up seats for others. The three-story auction house had around three hundred spots in total, all filled to capacity. Even then, countless others continued lobbying for entry.

Old Master Yang was inundated with calls at home. Some callers were prominent figures whose面子 (face) couldn’t be ignored, while others arrived in person with gifts, turning the household into a frenzy.

Guan Yu informed Jin Hua (Golden Flower) that an unknown treasure map had surfaced at the Yangs' auction. Jin Hua worriedly asked, “Is that treasure map real?”

Guan Yu shook his head. “It’s likely a forgery. Preliminary analysis confirms it’s fake.” Noticing her anxiety, he reassured her, “Don’t fret. Even if the treasure exists, I doubt anyone could find it. Why would someone who hid a treasure create a map for others to follow? Doesn’t that defeat the purpose?”

Jin Hua sighed uneasily. “I hope it’s fake. I’ve been counting on Zhang Han recovering her memories so we can locate the treasure and exact our revenge. If someone else finds it first… that would be unbearable.”

Guan Yu understood Jin Hua’s desperation. Her only hope for vengeance lay in that legendary treasure. With its wealth, she could build power to oppose the Yang family. Otherwise, a lone girl like her challenging the Yangs would be like throwing an egg against a rock.

“Don’t worry. Even if the treasure emerges, only I can obtain it,” Guan Yu declared firmly. Jin Hua gazed at him with unwavering trust. To her, his words carried the weight of prophecy.

Guan Yu added, “But I suspect these so-called treasure maps are mere rumors meant to stir greed. Luring influential figures to A City under this pretext must serve another agenda. What’s the real goal here?”

Jin Hua hesitated. “The rumor-monger might be desperate to find the treasure themselves. By mobilizing others, they could let others do the legwork and then swoop in to claim it. A classic ploy.”

“If Zhang Han’s mother truly sealed the treasure’s location in her mind,” Guan Yu reasoned, “she’d have left no clues for others. Thus, the map must be fake.”

“Exactly,” Jin Hua agreed. “The rumor’s originator might even be targeting you. From the start, they claimed a crucial fragment of the map was in your possession. What does that tell you?”

Guan Yu pondered. “You’re right. But who would orchestrate this?”

“Could it be the Yangs?” Jin Hua blurted. “If so, it all makes sense. First, they know you intimately. Zhang Han lives with you, and they fear you’ll uncover the seal in her mind. This chaos could be pressure tactics.”

“Possible, but I doubt it’s that straightforward,” Guan Yu countered. “If I found the treasure, shouldn’t the Yangs rejoice? As their sole heir and future son-in-law, opposing me gains them nothing.”

Jin Hua rolled her eyes. “You think too highly of yourself! Since when did the Yangs fully trust anyone? They’re cunning—they’d rather secure the treasure themselves than risk anyone else getting it. Take me: ‘missing, presumed dead.’ You think they don’t suspect you hid me?”

“You think they know I rescued you?” Guan Yu exclaimed.

“Very likely. If they suspect you, their cordiality is just a facade. They’d undermine you indirectly to avoid open conflict. If I were them, I’d do the same. By aiding me, you’ve aligned with their sworn enemy. Your loyalty is now questionable. Controlling the treasure’s legend is key to my vengeance—so they pressure you there.”

Guan Yu realized she might be right. At Houyuan Temple, Feitian Lang had accosted him, demanding the map as if certain Guan Yu possessed it. The Feng family had also learned his whereabouts suspiciously fast. If the Yangs leaked that information, it fit perfectly.

Nodding, Guan Yu said coldly, “If the Yangs are behind this, they’ll regret it.” Though his cultivation was gone, an intimidating aura emanated from him.

Jin Hua advised, “Don’t confront them yet. Their probes mean they still fear alienating you. Focus on the Fengs first—you can’t afford multiple enemies.”

“Agreed. Once I settle the Fengs… their cruelty leaves me no choice.”

Toppling the Fengs was Guan Yu’s priority, but their alliance with the Biller family complicated matters. He needed strategies, likely requiring discussions with his sisters at Huayu Group. Rash moves could incur heavy losses.

“Also, the Yangs’ auction won’t be peaceful. If you attend, stay vigilant,” Jin Hua warned.

Guan Yu pulled her close, smiling. “Don’t worry. I’ll observe from backstage. Only one representative per bidder is allowed, so I won’t risk entering alone. I’ll watch the bidding safely.”

Jin Hua nestled against him, pouting. “I’m starving. My appetite’s been poor lately, but now you’re here… I could eat a feast!”

“What do you crave? I’ll order delivery. Going out’s too risky,” Guan Yu said.

Reluctantly, Jin Hua sighed. “Fine. I want hotpot…”

“Hotpot? In this heat?” Guan Yu gaped.

“So what? The AC’s on! I’m craving it—don’t you want any?”

“Anything you want.” Guan Yu called Second-to-Wolf, his bodyguard-turned-errand-boy. “Buy hotpot for three and bring it up.”

“Damn it! Can’t you hire a courier? I’m your free bodyguard and now a deliveryman?” Second-to-Wolf grumbled.

“Hungry? Or should I fetch it myself?” Guan Yu retorted.

Grudgingly, Second-to-Wolf agreed. Guan Yu watched from the window as the black BMW drove off.

“So Second-to-Wolf’s been guarding you? Did he come with Yingzi?” Jin Hua teased.

Surprised she knew of Yingzi, Guan Yu explained, “No. My sisters insist Xue Jing accompanies me outdoors, but I didn’t want her knowing about you. This time, I asked Second-to-Wolf privately.”

“Ah, your brother-in-law’s been invaluable,” Jin Hua laughed.

“True,” Guan Yu admitted. “But he’s insufferably cocky. If I don’t keep him humble, he’ll float away.”

“You two bicker like brothers. Deep down, you’d die for each other.”

Guan Yu stroked her hair. “He saved my life. I’d trust him with it again.” He reminisced about their first meeting—when Second-to-Wolf, hired to kill him, switched sides and helped eliminate another assassin.

Later, when Guan Yu battled human traffickers abroad, Second-to-Wolf rushed to aid him without hesitation. Despite his complaints, he never faltered.

Soon, Second-to-Wolf called, panting. “I’m downstairs with two liquor cases! Help me carry this up!”

Guan Yu fetched him, grumbling about the excessive supplies. “Three people can’t eat this much!”

Second-to-Wolf grinned. “Jin Hua’s been cooped up—let her feast!”

Jin Hua giggled. “Even a pig couldn’t finish this!”

Guan Yu invited Pan Taisheng, a wine-loving friend, to join. The trio drank late into the night, with Second-to-Wolf passing out first. Pan left at midnight, while Guan Yu stayed over.

At dawn, pounding on the door and a ringing phone startled Guan Yu and Jin Hua awake. Second-to-Wolf’s voice barked through the line: “You piss the bed drunk or what?”
