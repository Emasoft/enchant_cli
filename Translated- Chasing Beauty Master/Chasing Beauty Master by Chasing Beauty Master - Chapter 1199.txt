Xiao Zhu gently rubbed her eyes and said, “What’s there to fear? If we just go out and let them see us, everything will be fine. No need to make such a fuss.”

Children’s minds are so simple. If escaping were that easy, Guan Yu would have long since gone out to inform everyone of their whereabouts.

Guan Yu said, “The main issue now is how you’ll explain yourselves if others see you leaving. Without a proper plan, even if we had a hundred mouths, we couldn’t clear this up.”

Lin Qiaoqiao had naturally considered this crucial point. If they carelessly emerged and were spotted by servants, rumors would spread like wildfire, tarnishing her reputation irreparably.

Though Lin Qiaoqiao was already betrothed as an unmarried bride, the conservative mindset here meant that an unwed woman sharing quarters with a man—let alone being discovered—would damage not only her standing but the entire Lin family’s honor.

**Chapter 3077: I Have a Brilliant Idea**

“Guan Yu, think of something! What do we do now? We can’t just stay here forever!” Lin Qiaoqiao pointed at him impatiently.

Guan Yu shot her a disdainful look. “*You* were the ones who insisted on staying here last night. I tried to send you away, but you refused. Now that this mess has happened, how is it my responsibility? I’ve got no solutions.”

“Aren’t you a man? Shouldn’t *you* handle this? Ugh, you’re insufferable!” Lin Qiaoqiao huffed angrily.

Xiao Zhu, however, remained unfazed. “Look how scared you both are! This is trivial to me. Stay here—I’ll go out, chase everyone away, and then you can leave.” She began marching toward the door.

Guan Yu swiftly grabbed her waist and pulled her back, exasperated. “Little ancestor, must you cause more trouble? Look at what you’re wearing! The courtyard’s swarming with people. Do you plan to parade outside half-dressed?”

The realization struck them—Xiao Zhu wore scarcely any clothing. With no spare garments here, the predicament deepened.

This was precisely why Xiao Yi (Auntie) grew increasingly frantic. Knowing Xiao Zhu had vanished without proper attire, she assumed the girl had been kidnapped and now paced anxiously, drenched in sweat.

Lin Qiaoqiao pulled out her phone, only to find it dead. Seeing this, Guan Yu suddenly brightened.

“I have an idea,” he announced.

“Out with it! No time for games!” Lin Qiaoqiao urged.

“I’ll go out alone first, find your father and Auntie, explain last night’s events, and have them dismiss the servants. Once the coast is clear, you two can slip out unnoticed. This way, gossip’s avoided.”

“Brilliant! Go now—Mom and Dad must be worried sick!” Lin Qiaoqiao pushed him.

Guan Yu added, “Wait here. Don’t move until I return.”

As he turned to leave, Xiao Zhu called out, “Brother-in-law! Don’t forget to bring me clothes!”

**Chapter 3078: Riding a Horse is Truly Exhausting**

Emerging, Guan Yu headed straight to the main hall where Lin Zhonggeng and Xiao Yi anxiously awaited.

Spotting him, Lin Zhonggeng rushed over. “Guan Yu! You may not know—Xiao Zhu and Qiaoqiao are missing! We’ve searched everywhere. Could they have been kidnapped?”

Xiao Yi joined in, distraught. “Please help us! Xiao Zhu was taken without even proper clothes!”

Guan Yu winced, unprepared for the commotion. Seeing Xiao Yi’s desperation, he resolved to confess.

Gesturing them closer, he whispered, “I must tell you something. Stay calm.”

Pausing, he continued, “Qiaoqiao and Xiao Zhu are in my quarters. We played cards until dawn and slept through the chaos. Please recall your staff discreetly—their reputation depends on secrecy.”

Lin Zhonggeng, trusting Guan Yu, nodded. “Those mischievous girls! A simple note would’ve spared this panic.” He promptly dismissed the servants.

To Xiao Yi, Guan Yu added, “Fetch Xiao Zhu’s clothes—she can’t emerge undressed.”

Xiao Yi hurried off, relieved her niece was safe.

Returning, Guan Yu tossed the clothes to Xiao Zhu. “Stay hidden until everyone’s gone. Avoid being seen.”

The girls nodded meekly. Xiao Zhu asked, “Was Mom terribly worried?”

“Worried? She’s drenched in sweat,” Guan Yu replied.

“I’ve troubled her again… I meant to sneak back earlier, but overslept,” Xiao Zhu sighed.

*Plans are flawless until reality strikes*, Guan Yu mused.

Once the coast was clear, the girls hurried to the main hall. Lin Zhonggeng chided, “Qiaoqiao! A heads-up would’ve saved us turning the estate upside down!”

Lin Qiaoqiao apologized, “I didn’t expect this… My phone died.”

“Enough,” Xiao Yi interjected. “Let this rest before rumors spread.”

Guan Yu admired her pragmatism—no probing questions, just swift resolution.

After breakfast, they prepared to depart. Guan Yu traveled light—a backpack and clothes in Lin Qiaoqiao’s trunk.

**Chapter 3079: Uncle**

Lin Qiaoqiao insisted horses could handle extra luggage. They’d ride to Xiao Yi’s village, faster than cumbersome carriages.

Only Guan Yu, Lin Qiaoqiao, and Xiao Yi set out initially. Lin Zhonggeng, detained by affairs, would follow tomorrow.

At 8 a.m., they mounted—Guan Yu with Lin Qiaoqiao, Xiao Yi with Xiao Zhu, luggage strapped to saddles. They aimed to reach the village by dusk.

The journey proved grueling. Galloping through a small desert against fierce winds slowed progress.

“Stay on this path,” Xiao Yi directed. “Past these woods lies our village.”

Sore from hours in the saddle, Guan Yu’s legs felt numb. Lin Qiaoqiao urged haste as twilight fell.

Unbeknownst to them, Second-to-Wolfollowed at a distance.

Finally, under pitch-black skies, they emerged from the woods. Faint lights glimmered ahead—a cluster of thatched huts.

Xiao Yi warned, “The northern edge is where the beast prowls. Hurry!”

The village appeared eerily quiet, few lights visible. Guan Yu noted its isolation—a hamlet nestled in mountainous basin, surrounded by fields.

Crossing a stream via ancient tree roots forming a natural bridge, they paid respects to the Sacred Tree before entering.

Xiao Yi’s home stood at the village edge—a modest hut with woven branches for walls. A stocky, kind-faced man emerged—her husband.

“You’re back!” he exclaimed, helping unload. “Traveling so late was risky!”

After settling in, Xiao Yi lit lamps. “Rest while I fetch hot water. You must be exhausted.”

Thus ended their harrowing journey—but unknown to them, greater trials lurked in the shadows of the whispering woods.
