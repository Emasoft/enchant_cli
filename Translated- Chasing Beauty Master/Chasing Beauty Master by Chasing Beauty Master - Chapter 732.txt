Guan Yu noticed beads of sweat forming on Zhao Xin’s nose tip. Yet stopping midway through the treatment was impossible. He extended his left hand, channeling his inner energy into his palm as he gently placed it on Zhao Xin’s lower abdomen, kneading with care.

Daboluo observed the scene and remarked, “Young Donkey’s technique is unprofessional. The rubbing should cover a wider area with faster strokes.”

“This is just random groping. He needs to move lower to reach the proper spot.”

“Ugh, this is agonizing to watch. Maybe Zhao Xin’s clothes are getting in the way.”

With that, Daboluo stepped forward, yanked up Zhao Xin’s blouse, and unzipped her skirt completely. “There! Now Young Donkey can properly treat your ‘soldiers.’ He’s a doctor—this is medical treatment. [800]”

Zhao Xin gasped indignantly. “Daboluo! What are you doing? You’re utterly shameless!”

Guan Yu remained focused. With Xue Jing present and medical ethics to uphold, Daboluo’s intervention did allow broader access to treat Zhao Xin’s pain.

The women continued teasing. “You have to motivate Young Donkey somehow. Who’d work for free?” As Guan Yu glanced down, a glimpse of white underwear made his blood surge, flushing his face crimson.

“Focus on the treatment,” Xue Jing warned sternly.

*She’s the one tempting me!* Guan Yu thought helplessly. After two full energy cycles, he withdrew his power once Zhao Xin’s warmth subsided.

“Wow! I feel amazing—no more pain sitting upright,” Zhao Xin sighed in relief.

Daboluo chuckled. “A few rubs made you this ecstatic? Young Donkey’s skills are impressive. Speaking of, I have hemorrhoids. Treat me next time!”

“Stop joking! He was genuinely healing me—unlike your dirty imaginations!” Zhao Xin retorted.

“Oh please! You’ve been sitting half-undressed for ages—clearly wanting more. Quit pretending.”

Blushing, Zhao Xin realized her state and hurriedly dressed. A lesbian bystander ogled her ample bosom, swallowing hard.

Daboluo turned to Xue Jing. “Jingjing, lend me Young Donkey for a few days? I’m parched—but promise not to break him.”

Xue Jing shook her head. “No loans. Hands off my man!”

“Stingy! Young Donkey, my back aches—could you examine me?” Daboluo switched tactics.

Another woman interjected, “After exhausting five male escorts nightly, you complain of back pain? You just want to devour him!”

Amidst laughter, an elegant beauty named Liu Hongshuang (Red Frost Willow) spoke seriously. “Jingjing, my father insists I marry Ran Qiang—a scoundrel from the Ran family. Could Guan Yu pose as my boyfriend during the arranged meeting?”

“Clever Hongshuang! Snatching Young Donkey through schemes!” Daboluo teased.

“If it’s respectable, Guan Yu will help,” Xue Jing consented. Guan Yu nodded.

The lively gathering ended at nine. Multiple women took Guan Yu’s number for “future ailments,” though Xue Jing reluctantly obliged.

Guan Yu saw value in connecting with these influential socialites. Later, he asked Xue Jing, “How’d you meet such unrestrained friends?”

“They vent pressures through words. Underneath, they’re proper—like Zhao Xin, who couldn’t open her eyes from shyness during treatment.”

High society bore unique strains. Their boldness stemmed from Guan Yu being the sole male present—an outlet for pent-up frustrations.

Returning home, Ah Mei had prepared dinner. Though full, Guan Yu ate sparingly to spare her feelings. He signaled Xue Jing: *Notify Ah Mei when we dine out.*

After school, Wei Hongwei warned, “Brother Guan, Ran Qiang might retaliate for humiliating his lackey.”

“He’s busy courting Hongshuang now,” Guan Yu replied. Liu Hongshuang soon called: “Don’t forget our act. I’ll pick you up.”

At the school gate, Wei Hongwei gave a thumbs-up before leaving. Guan Yu informed Ah Mei he’d dine out.

Hongshuang arrived in a black Mercedes S-Class. She took Guan Yu to luxury boutiques, transforming him into a dashing heir—his radiance overshadowing her deliberately modest attire.

Two months prior, Ran Qiang had become infatuated with Hongshuang. His father offered half their steel company’s shares as dowry. Though her father agreed, Hongshuang resisted Ran’s relentless pursuit.

At Huaiyang Restaurant’s private room, Ran Qiang emerged with roses. “Hongshuang, you’ve grown more beautiful.”

Clutching Guan Yu’s arm against her chest, Hongshuang purred, “Do you mind me accepting these, dear?”

“Keep them for tomorrow’s replacement. I bought you fresher ones today,” Guan Yu played along.

Onlookers murmured as Ran Qiang’s face twitched. “Impossible! Hongshuang with this… this boy?!”

Ran—a squat, rotund heir—glared at Guan Yu’s taller frame. Hongshuang pressed closer, her waist sinuous against him. Guan Yu reciprocated, savoring the charade’s perks.

“Bitch! You reject me for this pretty boy?!” Ran roared, throwing the roses. “You’ll regret this!”

Security arrived but refused Ran’s order to arrest Guan Yu. Humiliated, Ran swung a feeble punch at Guan Yu’s chest—ignored by the unfazed youth.

Hongshuang shielded Guan Yu, chastising Ran’s thuggish behavior. Incensed, Ran offered cash for insults against her, revealing his true colors.

Bystanders sneered at Ran’s crudeness. Guan Yu taunted, “A noble heir resorting to violence? How uncouth.”

Ran lunged again. Guan Yu—holding Hongshuang—let the punch land, unflinching. Hongshuang doubted Xue Jing’s praise of his prowess.

“Slut! Move or I’ll hit you too!” Ran brandished a tiger tattoo on his shoulder. “Earn cash by insulting her!”

The crowd recoiled at his depravity. Guan Yu’s eyes hardened. *Time to teach this pest a lesson.*
