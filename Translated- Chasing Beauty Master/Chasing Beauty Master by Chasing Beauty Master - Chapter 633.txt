“Ah!” The homeless man screamed, releasing his grip as his body was sent flying backward as if struck by a giant hammer, crashing onto the grass two or three meters away. He convulsed violently, resembling someone electrocuted.

The thick wooden club in his hand had disintegrated into splinters and powder, scattered across the ground like insect-chewed debris.

“What? What’s happening? Third Brother, what’s wrong?” The leader of the homeless men stammered, his tongue stiff with terror. He stumbled backward, releasing the ankle of the girl he had been restraining.

“Th-this… he’s a mutant!” The filthiest of the vagrants retreated in panic, staring fearfully at Guan Yu.

Though mutations and superhumans remained distant from ordinary life, the existence of genetically altered humans was no longer a secret. Most civilians had heard rumors. Yet witnessing such power firsthand was utterly shocking. Society already associated mutants and superhumans with Hollywood monsters and fantastical beings. Seeing one in reality was terrifying.

Freed from her captors, the young girl scrambled to her feet and darted behind Guan Yu, clutching his arm like a frightened animal. “Big Brother, save me! Chase these villains away!” she pleaded, her voice trembling.

Guan Yu tilted his head slightly, glancing at the delicate-featured girl before smirking at the two remaining men. “Still planning to kill me?”

Mutants. Who would dare fight such beings? Killing him? They’d be lucky to escape alive! Only fools courted death.

When the men stayed silent, Guan Yu shrugged. “No objections? Then I’ll take her.”

“Go! Just go!” The vagrants trembled like sieves, urgently waving them away.

Grabbing the girl’s arm, Guan Yu turned and strode away.

“Big Brother, are we really leaving? They bullied me! Shouldn’t you teach them a lesson?” The girl pouted, lifting her charming face indignantly.

“You want them punished?”

“Yes!” She nodded emphatically.

“Fine. Go back then. They’re still there.” Guan Yu pointed behind them.

The girl blinked in confusion. Return alone? Without his help? After nearly being abducted by three strong men? How could she, a vulnerable girl, confront them?

“If you can’t fight them, forget revenge,” Guan Yu said mockingly.

“But you can defeat them! Letting them go is wrong! They must be punished! Let’s call the police!” she insisted.

Guan Yu shot her an exasperated look but kept walking.

“Wait for me!” Afraid of being recaptured, the girl hurried after him. “You need to testify for me!”

“Testify? Spare me,” Guan Yu groaned, his face falling. He needed to contact Du Xiaojuan and Liu Shilei, return to Y City—not waste time playing witness. Worse, if authorities discovered his mutant abilities, chaos would follow. His years lost to Dragon Group still haunted him. Why repeat that nightmare?

The girl stomped angrily as Guan Yu outpaced her. Returning to his park bench, Guan Yu sat and said flatly, “You’re safe now. Leave.”

“No! I’m exhausted! I haven’t slept all night and nearly got assaulted! I’m resting here!” She plopped down beside him.

Guan Yu sighed. “Suit yourself.”

The girl fumed at his indifference. Most men would chat up an eighteen-year-old beauty, but he ignored her! Didn’t he wonder why she was here at dawn? Why she’d fled home?

Huffing, she grabbed his arm, hugging it to her chest before resting her head on his shoulder.

Guan Yu felt something soft and warm against his arm. He glanced sideways—she was actually trying to sleep against him!

“Miss, stop clinging. Go home,” he urged.

In his illusory world, beauties constantly pursued him. This was trivial.

“I won’t! I ran away and won’t face that wicked stepmother’s smug face!” she snapped, eyes flashing open. Clearly waiting for him to ask.

“Ran away?” Guan Yu asked dryly.

“Yes! I refuse to endure that hypocritical fox’s nonsense!”

Shaking his head, Guan Yu warned, “A delicate girl alone is dangerous. Remember what almost happened?”

“I’m safe with you! Uncle, let’s wander the world together!” she chirped brightly.

Chapter 1610: A Mouse Meeting a Cat

Wander the world? With her? Guan Yu’s face darkened. Was this girl serious? A rebellious runaway wanting adventure? After five minutes? Hero-rescues-maiden tropes belonged in stories!

“Tempting, right?” she pressed.

“Enough! I’m not interested,” Guan Yu refused.

“You’re so boring! I’ll stick with you! Where you go, I go! We’ll wander together!” she declared triumphantly.

“Who said I’m homeless?”

“Ha! Sitting on park benches at dawn? Admit it!”

“Fine, you win.” Guan Yu wiped his brow theatrically.

The girl beamed. “Don’t worry! With your powers, you’ll succeed! How much electricity can you store?”

“Store electricity?”

“Like charging!”

Guan Yu glared. Did she think he was a battery? Ignoring her, he focused ahead.

“I’m Xue Jing! Your name?” she prodded. When he stayed silent, she pinched his arm. “Answer!”

“Stop!” Guan Yu snapped, resisting the urge to fling her away. Only concern for her safety kept him patient.

Suddenly, tires screeched outside the park. Eight black-clad men vaulted the fence, spreading out to search.

“Owl, the cameras showed Miss entered here.”

“Find her fast! If anything happens, the boss will skin us!” their leader growled.

Spotting a white-clad figure on a bench, Owl radioed his team and approached.

Xue Jing jerked awake. “They found us! Run!” She yanked Guan Yu’s arm.

“Why should I run?”

“They’ll blame you for kidnapping me! Hurry!”

Owl studied Guan Yu, unease prickling his spine. This man radiated danger—a primal fear reminiscent of facing mythical beasts. Sweating, he managed, “Sir, we mean no harm. We’re here for our young miss.”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Take this silly girl home. Keep her from escaping again. She’d likely get sold while counting cash for her captors.”

Owl gaped at the casual authority. “Y-yes, sir!”

As his team arrived, Xue Jing struggled furiously. “Let go! I’m staying with him!”

Ten minutes later, Guan Yu sighed in relief as they dragged her away. Owl had discreetly passed him a phone and cash—mundane necessities even for a grandmaster.

Dialing Liu Shilei’s number, Guan Yu froze when a man answered. “Who’s this?”

“Guan Yu. Where’s Liu Shilei?”

“Guan Yu?! Wait—you sound like… Dong Bin here! Brother, is it really you?!”
