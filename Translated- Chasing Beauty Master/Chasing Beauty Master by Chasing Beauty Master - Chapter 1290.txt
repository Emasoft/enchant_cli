“Of course, besides imparting his cultivation to you, he will also fully charge your magical instrument with spiritual energy. Naturally, he must examine your instrument first. Only after assessing it will he bestow the cultivation most suited to you. Magical instruments are crucial, which is why I persuaded Xiao Zhi to acknowledge the bronze lock as its master. Only that lock truly complements him, ensuring optimal results from the impartation.”

Guan Yu asked again, “Hearing this, I find it truly astonishing. I never imagined something like the Meritorious Deeds Cauldron existed. Cultivation requires steady, grounded effort—haste leads to regression. Could this cauldron’s impartation bring adverse effects? Are there no hidden drawbacks?”

Elder Zheng shook his head. “That I cannot say. However, none of us elders have observed any ill effects. Recipients continue cultivating normally afterward. Even after receiving the impartation, future progress still depends on one’s own diligence to advance further.”

Xiao Zhi asked curiously, “Father, if the cauldron’s impartation has no drawbacks, why don’t you elders use it whenever you’re idle? Wouldn’t that accelerate your cultivation?”

Elder Zheng shot him a reproachful glance. “Always scheming shortcuts! The Meritorious Deeds Cauldron is our Yunqing Sect’s treasure—not some trinket to be used on whim! Access is strictly regulated. To date, only our sect leader has activated it twice. The second time followed the great battle against the Demon Sect. He suffered grave injuries, and a mishap during recovery caused qi deviation. Only the cauldron’s power stabilized him. Otherwise…” His voice trailed off meaningfully.

Guan Yu’s interest sharpened. He hadn’t known the cauldron possessed healing properties. The more he heard, the more he yearned to behold this marvel. What manner of artifact could it be? If only one could possess it… He dismissed the thought as idle fancy.

“Xiao Zhi raises a valid point,” Guan Yu pressed. “If the cauldron is so potent, why don’t you senior pillars of the sect use it during leisure to accumulate years of cultivation? With repeated use, you’d become invincible! Who would dare oppose Yunqing then?”

“Exactly!” Xiao Zhi chimed in. “Why leave such a treasure dormant? What holds you back?”

Elder Zheng sighed. “You oversimplify. Though mighty, the cauldron cannot be activated at will. Its seven-colored radiance must fully manifest before each use. After activation, the glow fades and requires prolonged recovery before reappearing. Moreover, as our sect’s sacred relic, none know its usage limits. We fear damaging it through overuse, thus employ it sparingly.”

Through this explanation, Guan Yu realized the cauldron’s utility was constrained—single activations followed by lengthy dormancy. Its vaunted power seemed underutilized. Yet he acknowledged its brilliance: during recovery phases, it presumably accumulated spiritual energy and arcane techniques, ready for harvest when reactivated. A formidable treasure indeed.

After Xiao Zhi and Aze bonded with their instruments, the pair rejoiced. Aze grinned, “This feels utterly different from the Yunqing Sword! The spiritual storage capacity is vastly greater.”

“Naturally,” Elder Zheng chuckled. “These qualify as mid-grade magical instruments. The Yunqing Sword barely qualifies as a magical tool—merely common steel with a spirit-storing gem in its hilt. These new acquisitions outclass it entirely.”

Guan Yu inquired, “Uncle Zheng, are magical instruments vital for cultivators?”

“Undoubtedly!” came the emphatic reply. “A superior instrument can thwart ten thousand soldiers or match a grandmaster cultivator. Their importance cannot be overstated.”

“If Yunqing Swords are so inferior, why doesn’t the sect issue better instruments? Our overall strength would surge.”

Elder Zheng regarded him with patient exasperation. “You presume Yunqing manufactures magical tools? Issuing high-grade instruments to all disciples? Where would we source them? These aren’t grains to be cooked in a pot!”

Chapter 3,320: Denials

As Elder Zheng good-naturedly mocked Guan Yu’s naivety, Xiao Zhi and Aze exchanged amused glances, relishing this rare chance to witness their peer’s comeuppance.

Guan Yu nodded, acknowledging his oversight. Elder Zheng continued, “Merely equipping all disciples with Yunqing Swords strains our resources. The hilt gems require painstaking refinement by elders during spare moments. Though humble, their creation is no simple task.”

“Our sect’s ability to provide even these basic swords to so many disciples is remarkable,” he added. “Larger sects possess greater resources—lesser schools cannot furnish proper instruments, leaving disciples with mundane weapons.”

Guan Yu grasped the implication. “This era values magical instruments above all. Regardless of cultivation level, one needs quality tools.”

By this measure, Guan Yu’s Soulfall Blade and Imperial Seal were priceless treasures. Elder Zheng cautioned, “When abroad, conceal your instruments. Until you can fully suppress their spiritual fluctuations, their aura may attract dangerous attention. Exercise utmost caution.”

Guan Yu assented. “Thank you for the reminder, Uncle Zheng. I’ll seek to mask their signatures after tomorrow’s impartation.”

Though skeptical—normally requiring years to synchronize with foreign instruments—Elder Zheng withheld doubt. Guan Yu had repeatedly defied expectations. Perhaps the cauldron’s blessing might achieve the impossible.

Chapter 3,321: Mountain Summit

At dawn’s first light, insistent pounding roused Guan Yu from sleep. “Wake up! We’re due at the grand hall!” Xiao Zhi’s voice boomed through the door.

Grumbling, Guan Yu dressed hastily. As Sect Leader Xuanming had specified, the impartation required sunrise’s potent yang energy to activate the cauldron. Without Xiao Zhi’s intervention, he might have overslept this pivotal moment.

The group arrived to find all peak elders assembled—including the reclusive Elder Jiu. The venerable master’s presence underscored the ceremony’s significance. After formal greetings, Xuanming instructed, “Follow Elder Jiu to the rear mountain summit. The ritual will commence there.”

Observing the gathered elders, Guan Yu noted Left Peak’s Elder Xiang glowering darkly, though none engaged his sour demeanor. Elder Lu and Elder Dai conversed quietly, occasionally glancing his way.

Following final instructions, Elder Jiu declared, “We depart.” The procession ascended—elders leading, disciples trailing.

Guan Yu whispered, “I didn’t realize Elder Jiu would escort us.”

Xiao Zhi explained sotto voce, “The summit is forbidden without his permission—even to the sect leader. Violators face severe punishment.”

“What secrets warrant such precautions? Hidden treasures?”

“Our sect safeguards two supreme relics,” Xiao Zhi murmured. “The Meritorious Deeds Cauldron and our foundation’s treasure—the Hidden Dragon Sword. Both reside atop the rear mountain.”

Aze hissed warningly, “Lower your voice! This knowledge is restricted to elders. We only know through Elder Zheng’s disclosures.”

Guan Yu pondered this. Why hoard such power unused? “If even Sect Leader Xuanming cannot wield the Hidden Dragon Sword, what purpose does it serve?”

“Our founder forged it,” Xiao Zhi revealed. “A peerless weapon blending martial and mystical arts. After the century-old Demon Sect war, it’s remained sealed. None possess sufficient cultivation to command it—not even our leader.”

As Guan Yu digested this, the terrain steepened. Dawn’s light revealed their destination—a cliffside plateau overgrown with waist-high weeds, evidently untrodden for years. Two ramshackle huts marked the entrance to cavernous chambers carved into the mountain’s heart.

Within the larger chamber, ancient furnishings stood pristine despite their age. A massive relief adorned the far wall—a battle scene frozen in stone. Sect Leader Xuanming directed, “Rest while we await the auspicious hour.”

Xiao Zhi slumped onto a bench. “I’m parched! Is there water here?”

“This isn’t a pleasure excursion,” Aze chided. “Prepare your spirit for the ritual.”

Guan Yu interceded, “Even immortals require sustenance.” Addressing Xuanming, he asked, “Master, may we fetch water?”

The sect leader gestured assent. “Check the inner chambers. The morning’s climb has left us all thirsty.”

As two disciples departed, Guan Yu studied their surroundings. The hidden complex’s sterile cleanliness contrasted with the derelict exterior. His gaze lingered on the enigmatic carving—what ancient conflict did it commemorate? The answers, like the summit’s secrets, remained veiled in morning mist.
