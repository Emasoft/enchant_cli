“Let me make this clear—your only hope now is to be sold to a decent owner. That’s your fate. But today’s buyer isn’t one to be trifled with. You’ll soon experience his methods firsthand. I’ll pick the two most disobedient ones today.”

Young Master Li’s words were meant to intimidate, and the women trapped inside the iron cages knew it. If they couldn’t escape, their futures were bleak. He wasn’t wrong—if they weren’t sold to a merciful owner, their lives would be cut short, likely ending in a beating within days.

“Don’t take me! Stay away!” Xiao Meihua (Little Plum Blossom) trembled as she stared at Magistrate Pang, whose leering expression left no doubt about his cruelty.

**Chapter 3905: Regret Sets In**

Xiao Meihua’s heart pounded with terror. Being sold to such a man would doom her forever.

The women in the cages understood Young Master Li’s daily visits were meant to break their spirits, conditioning them to accept their fate as slaves.

If sold to a lenient owner, they might cling to hope. But a ruthless master spelled disaster—a life cut short by violence. Slaves like them died daily, their faces forgotten.

Seeing Xiao Meihua’s fear, Young Master Li smirked. This was the effect he wanted: terror to crush resistance.

“You’ve lost the right to refuse. Your defiance sealed your fate. I’ll sell you today to rid myself of trouble.”

He strode into the cage, grabbing her like a stray kitten. Xiao Meihua scrambled backward, but there was no escape.

“Please, spare me! I’ll obey, I swear!” she begged, desperate to avoid Magistrate Pang’s clutches.

“Too late for regrets. You brought this on yourself. Had you behaved, I might’ve kept you longer. But now, disobedient ones go first.” He lunged, claws outstretched.

The other women shrieked. Magistrate Pang watched, aroused by their fear. “Excellent! The more they resist, the sweeter the conquest. Hurry—I grow impatient!”

The cramped cage left no room to hide. Cornered, Xiao Meihua was yanked out by her shoulders, thrashing uselessly against Young Master Li’s grip.

“Esteemed sir, this one’s the fiercest. Perfect for your tastes, no?” Li taunted, presenting her to Pang.

“Splendid. Hand her over.” Pang grabbed her chin, but she jerked away, defiance intact.

“Marvelous! Struggle all you want—it only fuels my delight!” His laughter echoed through the dungeon.

Xiao Meihua’s spirit withered. “Please, let me go! I don’t want to be a slave! You’re wealthy—why need one more?”

Her pleas fell on deaf ears. This charade—Li and Pang’s coordinated terror—was meant to crush rebellion.

“Poor thing. Don’t worry—I’ll keep you alive… until I tire of you.” Pang’s greasy smile twisted in the gloom.

The women recoiled. Xiao Meihua’s face paled as she wept. Li dropped her at Pang’s feet. “Satisfied? Shall you choose another?”

**Chapter 3906: A Major Crisis**

After the spectacle, Pang and Li emerged. Guan Yu, hidden outside, noted their location. He’d stayed to monitor the compound, ensuring no prisoners were moved.

Li chuckled. “Brilliant tactics, Magistrate. Those tricks shattered their resolve. We should’ve summoned you sooner.”

“Timing was key. They needed to teeter on despair for my intervention to break them.”

As they departed, Guan Yu rendezvoused with Wang Jun. “I’ll guard here until Prefectural Magistrate’s men arrive. Inform them to meet us directly.”

Wang Jun agreed. “I’ll wait at Liu Yun’s home, then guide them here.”

Dawn found Guan Yu concealed in the yamen’s courtyard. Magistrate Pang slept lazily, his soldiers slacking as usual.

Wang Jun waited anxiously on the street. By midday, a troop arrived—thirty soldiers led by Captain Yu.

“Captain, Guan Yu awaits inside. We’ve located the prisoners. Proceed to the yamen at once.”

At the yamen gates, guards scrambled to alert Pang, who lounged in his garden. “Soldiers? Here? Warn Li!”

Panicked, Pang donned his robes and confronted the newcomers. Wang Jun smirked. “Remember me, Magistrate? I’m Jiang Gongzi’s aide.”

Captain Yu stepped forward. “We’ve reports of slave trading. Step aside.”

Pang blanched but feigned ignorance. “Absurd! Where’s your proof?”

Wang Jun interjected. “We’ve a witness inside. Jiang Gongzi himself has monitored you all night.”

Desperate, Pang whispered to Wang Jun, pressing a wad of banknotes into his hand. “Name your price. Make this disappear.”

Wang Jun scoffed. “Jiang Gongzi isn’t swayed by coin. But if you send Captain Yu away, more rewards await.”

**Chapter 3907: Bribes and Betrayal**

Pang’s mind raced. If the hidden cages were discovered, ruin followed. He ushered the soldiers inside, stalling.

“Captain Yu, rest first. Refreshments await.”

Wang Jun trailed behind, taunting. “Your games end today. Guan Yu’s already inside.”

Pang’s facade cracked. “Must we escalate? Accusations harm us all.” He slid more silver notes into Wang Jun’s sleeve. “End this, and wealth follows.”

Wang Jun feigned temptation. “Generous, but Jiang Gongzi demands justice.”

Pang’s jowls quivered. “Justice? Let’s discuss terms—”

“Enough!” Captain Yu barked. “Search the premises. Now.”

As soldiers fanned out, Pang’s fate hung by a thread. All hinges on Guan Yu’s evidence—and whether greed or duty would triumph.
