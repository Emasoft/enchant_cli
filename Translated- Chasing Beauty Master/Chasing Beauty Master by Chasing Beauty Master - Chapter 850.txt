The bodyguards continued to chatter incessantly, with some of the original Feng family guards growing increasingly restless and contemplating escape. They all knew Guan Yu had even slain a First-Class Honor warrior. Without sniper coverage, none dared confront him directly. The grisly news reports about Sha Aman's horrific death still haunted their memories.

Billin's men fared better, most armed and maintaining composure.

As the searchlights died, snipers in the corners lost visibility. The abrupt shift from blinding light to utter darkness required human eyes time to adjust.

A second-floor window on the south building's side silently opened. A figure emerged and instantly melted into the crowd.

"Who's there?" guards shouted in the pitch-black night, flashlight beams crisscrossing wildly.

One guard aimed his light at the open window and roared, "Guan Yu's escaping! Catch him! He's getting away!"

Chaos erupted among the south building guards. Clad in identical Feng family uniforms, Guan Yu became indistinguishable in the darkness.

Billin's men blocking the rear courtyard gates hesitated to fire, their weapons useless against this sea of lookalike uniforms.

Gan Bili smashed a chair against a wall-mounted camera before barking into his phone, "Young Master Feng, show filial piety! Your father's dying - come see him now!"

Before Feng could respond, the line went dead. Limping madly toward his father's quarters, the young master screamed, "Fetch the doctors! Now!"

This commotion further unsettled the guards.

"What's happening?"

"Why call doctors? Who's hurt?"

As confusion spread, attention shifted to the east building where the limping heir disappeared inside.

Young Master Feng burst into his father's chamber to find the patriarch unconscious. Medical staff rushed in, noting the crude bandage on his wrist and severe blood loss.

Unnoticed in the turmoil, Gan Bili slipped from behind the door. Having knocked out the patriarch earlier, he'd been trapped in the sealed room until this moment.

"Though weak, your father's stable," a doctor finally announced. The heir collapsed in relief... until a crash echoed from below.

Gan Bili, finding exits blocked, had leapt through a window. Insulated gloves and boots allowed him to scale the electrified perimeter wall effortlessly.

"Find him! Goddammit, find him NOW!" the reinvigorated heir shrieked.

Billin's tactical error reignited the searchlights too soon - blinding everyone again. Amidst the confusion, Guan Yu realized the electrified walls trapped him.

As guards mobbed the south building entrance, Billin's amplified voice restored order: "Quiet! Snipers ready. Ang, organize five search teams."

"Remove all caps!" Billin commanded, remembering Guan Yu's stolen uniform. Hundreds of Russian-style naval caps hit the ground as snipers scanned faces.

Chapter 2195: Utter Exhaustion

For hours they searched. Dawn found weary guards still combing grounds under Young Master Feng's frenzied commands. "Tear this place apart! He's here somewhere!"

Only the west building remained. A guard captain hesitated: "Young Master... shouldn't we inform First Miss?"

"Where is she?"

"Tending the patriarch."

"Search anyway."

Meanwhile in the west building's forbidden chambers, Guan Yu lay sprawled on Feng Xihu's enormous floor-bed, breathing in her distinctive floral scent. Exhaustion overwhelmed him as distant shouts echoed.

Chapter 2196: Critical Moment

Feng Xihu emerged from her father's sickroom, dark-circled eyes blazing at the intrusion. "WHO authorized this?!"

Billin stepped forward smoothly: "A necessary precaution, Miss Feng. Weâ€”"

"I asked my brother!" she snapped, cutting him off. The cowed guards froze mid-search.

From his hiding spot, Guan Yu gripped a stolen pistol, ready to burst through the door. Outside, the standoff continued - Feng Xihu's wrath against her brother's obsession, while dawn's light crept across the compound...
