“But… isn’t this an incomplete cultivation technique? Even if purchased, it can’t be practiced. Do you have a way to complete it?”

Huang Wensheng shook his head. “I don’t have a solution now, but the wise choice is to buy it first regardless. We’ll figure things out later.”

Guan Yu couldn’t help rolling his eyes inwardly. Rich people are so capricious! Buying things whether useful or not—how domineering! If I had that money, I’d spend it on practical things instead of investing in this dubious item!

As Guan Yu fantasized about wealth, Huang Wensheng suddenly patted his shoulder. “By the way, Brother Guan Yu, I forgot to mention earlier—this item is for you, not me!”

Guan Yu froze, overwhelmed by conflicting emotions. They’d only met two hours ago, yet Huang was willing to spend tens of thousands of gold coins on a Heavenly Tier technique for him. This friendship was truly worth cherishing!

At that moment, Huang declared, “But I didn’t bring any money!”

The moved expression vanished from Guan Yu’s face. He stared blankly at Huang. “Young Master Huang, are you joking? What’s the point of all this talk if you have no money?”

Chapter 1301: One Hundred Thousand Gold Coins

Seeing Guan Yu’s anger, Huang chuckled awkwardly. “Don’t be upset. Use your money to buy this Heavenly Tier technique first. When we return to Jianguang City, if you dislike it, I’ll reimburse you!”

Though Huang’s logic seemed sound, Guan Yu had no rebuttal—because he possessed not fifty gold coins, let alone fifty thousand! After three seconds of silence, he confessed, “Young Master Huang, I lied earlier. Truth is… I’m penniless.”

Huang initially looked stunned, then burst into laughter. Guan Yu grew irritated, regretting his honesty. However, Huang soon clapped his shoulder. “Brother Guan Yu, that’s unfair! My reputation in Jianguang City may not be spotless, but I’ve never defaulted on debts! If I don’t repay you, come collect from me—or even my father—in Jianguang City!”

Guan Yu gaped in confusion. Did Huang think he was refusing to lend money? Had his explanation been misunderstood?

As Guan Yu tried to clarify, Huang grabbed his arm, pointing at a purple ring on his finger. “How can someone wearing a Purple Na Ring claim poverty?”

“Purple Na Ring?” Guan Yu blinked at the unfamiliar term. Examining the violet band on his index finger, he realized—when had this appeared? Could it be from Lion Camel, given secretly while he slept?

“Even if this is worth twenty thousand gold coins, it’s still insufficient for the Heavenly Tier technique!”

Huang sighed at Guan Yu’s bewildered expression. “The Na Ring stores items—I’m not asking you to sell it. Close your eyes and sense what’s inside.”

Following instructions, Guan Yu soon trembled. “There’s… one hundred thousand gold coins here!”

“See? Stop pretending! The honor of purchasing this technique falls to you. Don’t refuse! If unsatisfied, resell it to me—I’ll pay full price!”

Guan Yu’s mind reeled, ignoring Huang’s words. Who gave this Na Ring and fortune? For auction purposes? He glanced at Amy, who shook her head innocently. “Don’t look at me—I don’t know either.”

The crowd grew restless. “Why the silence? They bid fifty-five thousand! Where’s the fifty-thousand-and-one bidder?”

“Probably a troublemaker with empty promises!”

Huang stood abruptly. “We bid eighty thousand!”

“Eighty thousand! Are you mad? The Golden Auction House forbids credit!”

Before counterbids emerged, Guan Yu rose. “Correction—not eighty thousand, but one hundred thousand!”

The crowd collectively thought: These two embodied “Fools with too much money!”

Guan Yu’s extreme bid aimed to fully utilize Lion Camel’s funds—determined to obtain the technique while repaying debts, disliking owed favors.

Hearing the astronomical sum, Summerian Peak abandoned bidding. The technique wasn’t worth one hundred thousand—even complete ones rarely exceeded sixty thousand unless exceptionally rare. Moreover, he’d already humiliated Murong Yu, achieving his goal.

Yet Summerian grew intrigued by this mysterious bidder who overshadowed both him and Murong Yu. “Strange—I should recognize such wealth. Is he an outsider or nouveau riche?”

Meanwhile, Murong Yu seethed. He recognized Guan Yu—their three encounters always ended badly. Believing Guan Yu dead after the cliff fall, here he stood unharmed, flaunting inexplicable riches!

Having lost to both rivals, Murong rose furiously. “Why aren’t you dead yet?”

Chapter 1302: Alliance

“Why aren’t you dead yet?”

All eyes turned to Guan Yu as Murong Yu snarled. Huang whispered, “You know him?” Guan Yu nodded curtly, sneering, “Why should I die?”

“Falling from a ten-thousand-foot cliff yet surviving—impressive!” Murong’s lips trembled with rage.

Huang marveled inwardly—Guan Yu had hidden depths! Surviving such a fall defied belief.

Murong pressed on. “I don’t care how you obtained this wealth or your true identity—today, you’re finished!”

“Save your boasts! Last time at Tigerhead Mountain ended too soon. I’ve been waiting for this rematch!”

At “Tigerhead Mountain,” the crowd stirred. Though some hadn’t been present, all knew the legend—the Crystal Toad stolen by an unknown youth who fell to his death… until now.

Murong seized the moment. “You’re correct! This wretch stole the Crystal Toad! It’s likely still on him! United, we can reclaim it!”

The crowd stirred greedily—the Crystal Toad’s value exceeded three hundred thousand gold coins! As tensions mounted, laughter erupted.

“How laughable!”

All turned to Summerian Peak, who scoffed, “Fools! Can’t you see you’re being manipulated? Even if he possessed it, would he carry such treasure openly? More likely, it’s hidden—or consumed!”

The crowd paled at the latter possibility. Summerian continued, “If the story’s fabricated, this debate is meaningless. Suppose he has it—could any of you keep it? With so many claimants, bloodshed would ensue!”

His words cooled passions. Murong roared, “I’ll settle with this wretch personally! Interfere, and face consequences!”

“Threatening me?” Summerian glanced at Guan Yu. “Shared enemies make allies. Helping a friend isn’t meddling. Tell your royal masters—the Black Dragon Mercenary Corps fears no one!”

“Black Dragon Mercenaries?” Guan Yu started—he’d killed a Blackwater Mercenary captain before, but this was their superior counterpart.

Huang whispered, “Brother Guan Yu! Having the Black Dragon heir’s support—remarkable! I may need your favors!”

“He’s their young master? Then Xia Yue’er…” Realization dawned—her rebelliousness made sense as a mercenary princess, despite their humble lodgings together.

Murong spat, “Threaten you? The Black Dragon Corps leads the Dark Mercenary Alliance—war would bring chaos! But your bandit horde pillages and plunders! Justice will destroy you!”

Chapter 1303: The Enemy of My Enemy

Summerian’s speech had quelled the mob. Murong laughed mockingly. “How admirable—a mercenary turned orator! But this is between me and the wretch. Interfere, and bear the consequences!”

“The enemy of my enemy becomes my friend.” Summerian smiled coldly. “Inform your royal puppeteers—the Black Dragon Corps doesn’t fear war!”

Murong’s face twisted. “You’ll regret this!” He stormed out, followers in tow. The auctioneer declared Guan Yu the winner, though celebratory mood had evaporated.

Huang sighed. “Trouble follows you like shadows, Brother Guan Yu.”

Summerian approached, eyeing Guan Yu curiously. “You’ve caused quite the stir. My sister speaks highly of you.”

“Xia Yue’er? She’s safe?”

“Safer than you,” Summerian smirked. “Come—we’ve much to discuss.”

As they exited, Guan Yu glanced at the Na Ring—its mysterious origin and Summerian’s interest foretold storms ahead. Yet with enemies multiplying, allies became priceless...
