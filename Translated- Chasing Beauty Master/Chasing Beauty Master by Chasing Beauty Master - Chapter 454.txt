The next morning, Guan Yu boarded a flight to Tibet with Wang Xiaojun and Yun Xuanwu. To his disappointment, there was no legendary sword-riding flight he'd hoped for. However, Master Yehe gifted him a cultivation artifact before departure - a Jade Slip. Though merely an information-storage device, this novel trinket fascinated Guan Yu. As he toyed with it, spiritual messages from Master Yehe about Core Formation cultivation surfaced within.

"Behold the mountain gate of Xiao Yao Sect. Please wait, Brother Guan." Upon landing, Yun Xuanwu parted ways. The Cold Mountain Sect's abode stood atop perpetual snow-capped peaks, distinct from Heavy Sword Palace and Xiao Yao Sect's territories.

Before Guan Yu stretched an emerald grassland dotted with grazing livestock under azure skies. "Where's this supposed 'mountain gate'?" he wondered aloud, seeing only pastoral peace.

Wang Xiaojun withdrew a talisman from his robe. With a finger flick, it spontaneously combusted. Reality warped instantly - they now stood halfway up a colossal mountain.

"Who seeks audience?" Boomed a voice as golden radiance pierced dispersing mist. A massive gate materialized, inscribed with glowing protective arrays. Unwary trespassers might escape annihilation but certainly humiliation.

"Heavy Sword Palace's Wang Xiaojun requests audience with Daoist Yan Qing!" Wang declared, clearly familiar with protocol.

"Brother Wang! Please await in the guest pavilion while I inform our senior brother." The golden light dimmed as two junior acolytes emerged, bowing respectfully before serving tea.

"Rest assured," Wang chuckled, "I vowed to your master I'd resolve this."

"Your aid shall be remembered," Guan Yu stated firmly, unaware of venomous eyes glaring from afar.

"Senior Brother! That's Guan Yu who humiliated me!" Liu Rushu's face twisted with malice. "Avenge my disgrace!"

Yan Qing shook his head. "I know the full story. With Wang Xiaojun involved, I won't jeopardize our friendship for personal vendettas."

Chapter 1133: Xiao Yao's Yan Qing

Liu pressed a jade vial into Yan's palm. "This Core-Enhancing Pill cost me all my merit points. Help me settle this, or my cultivation will stagnate!"

Cultivators most dread unresolved grievances - such spiritual blockages risk qi deviation, hence the adage "Enlightenment at dawn, transcendence by dusk." Smooth comprehension enables rapid progress.

Yan Qing inhaled sharply at recognizing the Green Origin Pill. After visible internal struggle, his fist closed around the vial.

"Brother Wang! Forgive my tardy welcome." Yan Qing's greeting froze upon noticing Guan Yu. "And this...?"

"Guan Yu of White Cloud Temple." Guan frowned under Yan's piercing gaze that inexplicably sapped his breath.

Wang explained their purpose. Before finishing, Yan Qing's roar thundered: "KNEEL! You dare seek help after insulting our sect?"

The command exploded in Guan's skull like bestial fury. Blood trickled from his orifices as he resisted the compulsion through sheer willpower, teeth sinking into his tongue.

"Stay your hand!" Wang roared, too late to intervene.

Yan Qing raised an eyebrow. Infused with half his spiritual power, that shout should've shattered weaker cultivators. "Interesting..."

"Let's leave!" Guan swayed, crimson-masked. "This poison isn't worth it!"

"Xiao Yao Sect isn't some tavern!" Yan sneered.

Wang interjected coldly: "Know that Dragon Group backs him. Proceed if you dare court their wrath!"

Yan Qing's smirk faltered. "Very well. Three conditions: First, resolve the Dragon Group conflict from my brother's blunder. Second, Liu Zizai joins Cold Mountain Sect. Third..." His eyes glinted. "Survive my Spirit Severing-level strike at the Dharma Assembly."

"Madness!" Wang protested. "He's newly formed his Golden Core!"

"Or kneel in apology!" Yan Qing's palm glowed ominously.

"STRIKE THEN!" Guan roared.

The ensuing punch manifested as a sky-filling fist. Before impact, its gale already shredded Guan's robes. Yet amidst the maelstrom, Guan's eyes mirrored the incoming attack's spiritual pathways. His counter-palm erupted in identical brilliance.

BOOM!

Blood-misted shockwaves scattered both combatants. Guan collapsed coughing black blood as Yan Qing staggered back, murder gleaming in widened eyes.

"Fascinating... Mimicking cultivation techniques? Your talent dies today!"

"Mark my words," Guan spat through crimson teeth, "This insult will be repaid."

Chapter 1134: Nascent Core Ascension

Post-trial, Guan underwent month-long detoxification in the Marrow-Cleansing Pool. Emerging renewed, he accepted Wang's "visit" to Heavy Sword Palace - veiled cultivation retreat.

Fifteen days later, draconic roars shook training grounds as swirling qi announced his breakthrough - the true cultivator's milestone: Golden Core formation.

"Congratulations! Spar with me?" Wang grinned, starved for worthy opponents.

"Prepare for humiliation before your juniors," Guan smirked, flexing revitalized limbs.

Their duel platform confrontation drew jeers: "Who dares challenge our chief disciple?!"

"All of you. Now." Guan's dismissive gesture ignited fury.

Zhang Xiaoran's seven-sword flourish met Guan's sky-smothering counterpunch - an exact replica of Yan Qing's technique. The youth flew off-platform unconscious.

"Thief! How dare you use Xiao Yao's secret arts?!"

"Blame your inadequacy, not my capability," Guan retorted. "Six together! I'll abstain from their techniques this time."

The ensuing melee saw six disciples battered by their own signature formations, mirroring Zhang's earlier defeat. Wang watched grim-faced as Guan dismissed them like autumn leaves.

"Your sect's weakness isn't my doing," Guan stated coldly. "The strong prevail - heavenly dao's decree."

Wang nodded tersely, pride warring with pragmatism. Not all could accept defeat gracefully - some scores demanded settling.
