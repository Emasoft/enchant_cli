Guan Yu nodded faintly, looking at Old Man Zhao with some puzzlement, unsure of the meaning behind his question.

Old Man Zhao furrowed his brows deeply, sighed, and muttered quietly, "Your schooling... What about Jing'er's treatments? If it's twice a week... The process would take too long."

Guan Yu immediately grew vigilant, scrutinizing Old Man Zhao up and down. Damn, what's this old codger getting at? Could he be trying to rope me into being a full-time caretaker? Absolutely not. He might agree to three or five days, even ten or half a month. But... This girl's condition would undoubtedly require much longer to treat and recuperate.

Noticing Guan Yu's guarded expression, Old Man Zhao forced an awkward smile. "I know... This request is truly excessive! Guan Yu, consider this old man's plight—I have no one else but this granddaughter. Could you grant me this favor?"

"Impossible. Absolutely impossible!" Guan Yu shook his head like a rattle-drum. Taking care of her for a year, even three to five years? He had too many matters to attend to—how could he waste so much time here?

Seeing Guan Yu reject him without hesitation, Old Man Zhao flushed crimson with urgency. "Jing'er won't cause you any trouble! Truly, she's been obedient since childhood! Just treat her after school or during breaks—keep her condition from worsening. We'll accommodate any of your needs. Please?"

Guan Yu scratched his head, mind racing. Treat her daily after school? Then...

"Wait, Old Master, what exactly are you suggesting?" Guan Yu leaned forward hesitantly.

Old Man Zhao glanced at his granddaughter and declared solemnly without consulting her: "When you return to N City, take Jing'er with you. I'll assign bodyguards and nurses. You need only treat her in your spare time. That's all I ask!"

"I know this is unreasonable! Name any condition—I'll fulfill it without question!" Old Man Zhao thumped his chest resolutely.

To Guan Yu, these words held no particular weight. Yet had others—merchants or officials—heard such a promise from the revered founding father of the nation, they'd have been overjoyed. Old Man Zhao commanded respect even from the nation's leader, with all dignitaries paying homage during his birthdays.

Oblivious to these implications, Guan Yu waved casually. "You flatter me, Old Master. I agree—I thought you meant to imprison me here!" He chuckled lightly.

"Never! Of course not..." Old Man Zhao shook his hands rapidly, nodding obsequiously.

As they finalized arrangements, Zhao Jing'er on the sickbed frowned. "Grandpa, where are you sending me?"

"N City! Guan Yu studies there. He'll treat you after classes and on weekends!" Old Man Zhao beamed.

"Are you hungry? I'll have food prepared. What would you like?" He leaned close with grandfatherly affection.

Jing'er pouted. "I'm not hungry, Grandpa."

"Even so, you must eat! Old Master, *I'm* starving!" Guan Yu patted his stomach with a grin.

At Guan Yu's remark, Old Man Zhao hurriedly nodded. "I'll arrange it immediately!"

The old man hobbled out cheerfully with his cane, likely instructing bodyguards about the meal.

Left alone with Jing'er, Guan Yu cleared his throat awkwardly. "This... My qigong treatment requires direct contact over the affected area. Your heart condition leaves no choice..."

"Mm..." Blushing, Jing'er nodded, her earlier resentment easing at his explanation.

Silence fell until Jing'er suddenly flushed deeper, hesitating as if holding back words.

"What's wrong?" Guan Yu tilted his head gently.

"Must... must it truly be skin contact?" Her gaze darted away nervously.

"Of course!" Guan Yu replied offhandedly before pausing. Wait—was she... a stone maiden?

The realization struck: her menstrual blockage explained her embarrassment. The solution—piercing the obstruction—was simple in theory, but the method...

Coughing into his fist, Guan Yu averted his eyes. "We'll address that later. Your heart takes priority now."

"Big Brother Guan... Are you really a university student?"

"Yes!" He answered without shame—his enrollment might be through connections, but technically, he was one.

Jing'er's eyes shone wistfully. "You must study well. I... never attended school." Loneliness tinged her voice.

"School isn't everything! Self-study works too—"

"Exactly! I've taught myself through books!" She brightened, cutting him off excitedly.

As Guan Yu searched for praise, Jing'er produced a chemistry workbook from under her pillow. "Can you explain this problem? The answer key confuses me."

Guan Yu glanced at the advanced exercises and chuckled nervously. "This... is simple! I'll find you a tutor later."

"But—"

"Studies can wait!" He hurriedly deflected—even middle school material might stump him.

Jing'er sighed, setting the book aside. "If I recover... can I attend university with you?"

"Your grandfather can arrange that," Guan Yu mused.

Her face lit up. "When I'm better, I'll go! I've always dreamed of it."

Guan Yu stifled a smile—she seemed too young for college, but kept the thought to himself.

**Chapter Two Hundred and Seventy-Four: I'll Cook For You**

When Old Man Zhao returned with staff, Guan Yu urgently stopped them—Jing'er's hospital gown bore a burnt handprint from his treatment, risking exposure if she rose.

Blushing fiercely, Jing'er clutched her blankets. "I'm not hungry..."

After persistent coaxing, Guan Yu intervened. "Gentlemen, please step out."

Catching on, Old Man Zhao ushered everyone out.

Alone with two nurses, Guan Yu scratched his head. "Could she have fresh gown?"

"Wait—" Jing'er protested tearfully before whispering, "Big Brother... you should leave too."

Realizing his blunder, Guan Yu fled red-faced.

Later, as staff marveled at the charred gown contrasting Jing'er improved vitality, Old Man Zhao glowed with pride. Despite lacking medical support, she now appeared sturdier.

Jing'er nibbled sparingly while Guan Yu devoured his meal. "Eat more for strength!" he urged through mouthfuls.

"I... get nauseous," she confessed weakly.

Using his diagnostic skill, Guan Yu identified her severe nutrient deficiencies. "Wait here—I'll cook something proper!"

Ignoring skeptical glances, he stormed the hospital kitchen. Cross-referencing ingredients with his mental data, he whipped up peculiar dishes tailored to her needs.

"Done!" He grinned at stunned chefs. "Deliver these to the fourth floor!"

The bizarre meals—precisely calibrated through his enhanced perception—would tackle Jing'er's deficiencies. Whether they pleased her palate remained to be seen, but Guan Yu's confidence never wavered.
