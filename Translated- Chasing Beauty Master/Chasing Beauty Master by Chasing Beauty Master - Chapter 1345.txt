“Young Master, what business do you have with our proprietress?” the waiter inquired politely. It was rare to see someone demanding to see the proprietress outright.

Moreover, the proprietress seldom showed herself to guests. The waiter eyed the lavishly dressed young man before him—his refined features and noble bearing made him wonder if this visitor meant trouble.

“Enough chatter. I have urgent matters to discuss with your proprietress.” Qin Taijin paused, then added, “Never mind. I’ll find her myself.”

He strode directly toward the stairs, intent on heading upstairs to seek Xi Liu. As he ascended, Wang Xiaorong, positioned on the second floor, immediately recognized him.

**Chapter 3,477: The Scoundrel**

Wasn’t this the same scoundrel who harassed her last night? Back again so soon? A regular patron, it seemed—proof that the courtesans of Huiyin Lou truly excelled at their craft.

Last night, with Guan Yu present, Wang Xiaorong had stifled her fury to maintain her composure. The sacrifice to preserve her image had been immense.

Now that Guan Yu was absent, the audacity of this man’s return! “This young lady is going to teach you a lesson today,” Wang Xiaorong declared, marching toward the staircase.

She intercepted Qin Taijin, positioning herself before him with deliberate allure. A flirtatious glance from her nearly sent him tumbling backward.

Qin Taijin’s legs turned to jelly. Though his heart still yearned for Siqi, the mischievous beauty before him possessed a charm unlike any other—a playful radiance absent in countless others.

“What a delightful surprise today,” Qin Taijin licked his lips, grinning. “Young lady, might I ask why you’ve blocked my path?”

“Must one have a reason to seek your company, Young Master?” Wang Xiaorong feigned desperation for affection, exaggerating her gestures.

Qin Taijin’s mouth watered. “Of course not! I’d gladly serve a beauty like you day and night. Shall we find a quiet spot to… converse?”

“Splendid. Follow me.” Wang Xiaorong turned, beckoning him with a crook of her finger—a motion that nearly stole his soul.

Qin Taijin marveled. Who knew Huiyin Lou hid such peerless beauties? A gem like her wasted as a mere courtesan! If she pleased him today, he resolved to buy her freedom.

Wang Xiaorong led him toward an empty room, planning to thrash him discreetly. Pleased by his docile compliance, she quickened her steps.

“Young Master Qin, you’ve returned.” A voice interrupted. Xiao Bao, noticing Qin Taijin’s drooling gaze fixed on Wang Xiaorong, called out curiously as he shuffled behind her like a mindless puppet.

“What’s this?” Qin Taijin blinked, bewildered. “Do I have acquaintances here?”

Xiao Bao rushed over, determined to prevent him from following Wang Xiaorong—especially knowing her true identity as the Demon Soul Sect’s young mistress. “Young Master Qin, where are you headed?”

“Who are you?” Qin Taijin scowled at the inferior-looking girl blocking his view. “Move aside. Don’t obstruct me—or my view of beauty.”

“Young Master, don’t you remember me? We drank together joyfully yesterday.” Xiao Bao stood firm, refusing to yield.

She couldn’t reveal Wang Xiaorong’s identity without risking trouble for the Strange Demon Cave.

“Yesterday?” Qin Taijin’s anger flared at the blocked path. Realization struck—this girl had escorted him home. “Was it you who took me back yesterday?”

Xiao Bao beamed, thrilled he remembered. “Yes! You were too intoxicated, so I ensured your safe return.”

“You meddlesome wretch!” Qin Taijin roared. “Who asked for your help? Countless women beg to serve me—what gives a lowly courtesan like you the right? Do you know how this tarnishes my reputation?”

His furious glare petrified Xiao Bao. Her foolish fantasies—of becoming his lawful wife—shattered. He felt nothing for her.

Qin Taijin abruptly softened, mindful of maintaining his image. “Ah, forgive my temper. I didn’t mean to offend. You’re not angry, are you?”

Xiao Bao forced a smile. “Of course not. Your happiness is all that matters.”

“Splendid. I’ll return shortly.” Qin Taijin turned, adding, “And… thank you for yesterday.”

As the Qin family’s prodigal heir, his standards were impossibly high. Girls like Xiao Bao—plain and lowborn—beneath his notice. Their brief entanglement was a stain he wished erased.

“Young Master, why linger? I await you.” Wang Xiaorong’s siren call revived his spirits.

Xiao Bao warned, “Don’t go! She means you harm!”

Qin Taijin shoved her aside. “Filthy whore! What right have you to hinder me?”

Xiao Bao pleaded through tears, “She seeks revenge for last night! Please, believe me!”

“Lies!” Qin Taijin sneered. “She’s innocence itself. Your jealousy reeks!”

“It’s not like that!” Xiao Bao sobbed, heartbroken by his cruelty.

“Disappear! I never want to see you again!”

Wang Xiaorong watched coldly. Such devotion wasted on a scoundrel!

“Cease this disturbance!” Xi Liu materialized, soothing Xiao Bao. “Retire to your room. I’ll handle this.”

As Xiao Bao departed, Xi Liu addressed Qin Taijin. “Your commotion disturbs my guests. Are you here to make trouble?”

“Proprietress, your courtesan overstepped.” Qin Taijin gestured to Wang Xiaorong. “I merely wished to converse privately with this beauty.”

“Xiao Bao is under my care,” Xi Liu countered. “State your business.”

Qin Taijin tossed her a pouch of silver scraps. “For discretion. Yesterday never happened.”

Xi Liu weighed the meager sum, stifling laughter. “The mighty Qin heir’s reputation is worth so little?”

“How dare you mock me!” Qin Taijin bristled. “I could buy this hovel tenfold!”

“Try,” Xi Liu dismissed. “But remember—any misfortune here is of your own making.”

Wang Xiaorong interjected, “I’m no courtesan. Follow me outside.”

As they exited, Qin Taijin scrabbled for his discarded coins. Wang Xiaorong rolled her eyes—wealth had only magnified his stinginess.

**Chapter 3,479: A Bitter Lesson (Part 2)**

Beyond Huiyin Lou’s gates, Wang Xiaorong declared, “Know this—I’ve no ties to this place.” Her fingers crackled with latent fury. The lesson would be unforgettable.
