“Hello, it’s a pleasure to meet you,” Qi Zhi said, deliberately extending his hand for a handshake with Qing Linger. He thought to himself that even if nothing else came of this encounter, he should at least take the chance to touch her seemingly silken-smooth skin through this polite gesture. Otherwise, today’s brief meeting would be wasted.

Qi Zhi’s hand hung in the air, but Linger made no move to accept it, her unfriendly gaze making her reluctance clear. She knew all too well that a handshake would inevitably lead to him taking liberties. This hand, she decided, must not be shaken.

Yet not wanting to appear rude, she turned to Guan Yu and said, “Brother Guan, it seems Manager Hou’s friend is quite enthusiastic. Hehe, it’s getting late—let’s hurry off. We can take our time getting acquainted another day.”

Hearing this, Qi Zhi hastily interjected, “Oh, Brother Guan Yu! Where are you all off to? It’s still early! Why not sit and chat awhile? None of us have pressing matters, surely.”

Qi Zhi’s bold insistence on keeping Linger around to talk was audacious, especially in Guan Yu’s presence. Had anyone else dared speak so recklessly, Guan Yu would have already lost his temper. But Qi Zhi, ignorant of the underlying dynamics, mistook Linger for Guan Yu’s younger sister. In reality, everyone close to Guan Yu regarded Linger as his woman. No one with sense would dare harbor improper thoughts about her—not even Second Only to Wolf, a man notorious for his voracious appetites.

Guan Yu, well aware of Linger’s aversion to the handshake, said coolly, “There’s an issue at Linger’s home I need to help resolve. We’ll catch up another time.”

Most would have taken this as a dismissal, but Qi Zhi pressed on, “Oh? Where does Miss Linger live? Someone of her elegance must reside in a high-end neighborhood, no?”

Guan Yu’s displeasure flared. Asking a young woman her address so bluntly was outrageous. In City A, no one dared pursue Linger without Guan Yu’s approval—or her own initiative. Yet here was Qi Zhi, shamelessly overstepping. Second Only to Wolf watched with amusement, curious how Guan Yu would handle this.

Though Linger maintained a smile, it no longer held warmth. Qi Zhi’s behavior amounted to harassment. She looked to Guan Yu, silently urging him to respond.

Guan Yu’s smile remained, but his tone turned icy. “Brother Qi Zhi, don’t you think it’s time to leave? You’re overstepping.”

“What? I merely admire your sister,” Qi Zhi retorted, emphasizing the word “sister” as if to imply she was fair game. “She’s perfection incarnate. Does she have a boyfriend?”

“She already has someone in her heart,” Guan Yu snapped. “Abandon your delusions.”

Undeterred, Qi Zhi turned directly to Linger. “Miss Linger, don’t you think our meeting today is fate? I don’t care if you’re spoken for—give me a chance!”

Linger’s gaze never wavered from Guan Yu, her eyes reflecting not sisterly affection but something far deeper. Qi Zhi’s frustration grew as he recognized the unspoken bond between them.

Guan Yu’s patience shattered. “I called you ‘brother’ out of courtesy. Don’t mistake my tolerance. My sister wishes you gone. Leave now, and consider it a favor to Hou Jinshun.”

Stunned by Guan Yu’s bluntness but aware of Second Only to Wolf’s intimidating presence, Qi Zhi grudgingly retreated. “Miss Linger, if you ever reconsider, I’m at the Pang Taisheng Apartments nearby. Goodbye.”

“Wait,” Guan Yu commanded as Qi Zhi turned to leave.

Qi Zhi froze, eyeing Guan Yu warily. “Yes?”

“You live at Pang Taisheng Apartments?” Guan Yu asked slowly.

“What’s strange about that? It’s a decent complex—good environment, reasonable prices. Why?”

Guan Yu’s gaze sharpened. “How long have you been there?”

“Not long. Why does it matter?”

After a tense pause, Guan Yu dismissed him. “Nothing. Go.”

As Qi Zhi left, Guan Yu’s mind raced. Having Qi Zhi near Linger’s residence was dangerous. He resolved to have Pang Taisheng evict the man immediately.

**Chapter 2883: Resolution**

Second Only to Wolf dropped Guan Yu and Linger at Pang Taisheng Apartments. Noticing a flower shop nearby, Guan Yu decided to placate Jin Hua with a bouquet.

“What flowers do you like?” he asked Linger.

Blushing, she murmured, “It depends... Flowers from someone special are always lovely.”

As Guan Yu smiled, a firecracker’s bang startled them. A uniformed man nearby slapped a crying boy who’d set it off.

“Even if the child was wrong, he shouldn’t be beaten!” Linger protested, pulling Guan Yu toward the scene. The boy’s tear-streaked face hardened Guan Yu’s resolve to intervene, his protective instincts flaring anew.
