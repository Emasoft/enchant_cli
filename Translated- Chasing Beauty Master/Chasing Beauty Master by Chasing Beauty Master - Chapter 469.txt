“Hahaha… Interesting. Responsibility? Can you bear it? Do you know how many died this time? Can you shoulder these burdens, Ye Qingfeng? Let me tell you—I never wanted to save you. Why should I?” Guan Yu stared at Ye Qingfeng like a teacher catching a cheating student, his gaze frigid and merciless.

“I never asked you to save me…” Ye Qingfeng’s icy face twitched. Guan Yu’s words pierced like swords, each strike targeting his heart, leaving him powerless to retort.

“Heh. You think I saved you out of kindness? Since you prefer bluntness, I’ll be direct. First, you’re the son of Kunlun’s sect leader—valuable leverage. Second, you’re Qingling’s elder brother… you understand. Third, this operation was my initiative. If you ever want to die again, don’t choose such timing or location. Clear?” Guan Yu’s voice chilled the air. With each point, Ye Qingfeng’s face contorted further, his humiliation so visceral he wished for death.

“I don’t care who you are. You speak of bearing responsibility? Do your junior brothers have families? What of the slain Dragon-Tiger Mountain disciples? Face their kin yourself, then you’ll understand true duty. Now hide somewhere—don’t become my burden.” Guan Yu scoffed, turning away from the livid Ye Qingfeng.

Approaching the base, Guan Yu inhaled sharply at the sight before him.

“One, two… twelve Golden Core cultivators. Impressive. The Demon Sect’s strength exceeds expectations. Duan Fei, Situ Lang, Situ Tianjiao… All old acquaintances present.” Guan Yu’s eyes glinted coldly as he observed the crumbling golden barrier and the besieging cultivators. “How amusing. Is Qiankun Sect betting everything on this assault?”

“How much longer must this damned formation trap us? Duan Fei, any ideas?” The Golden Core cultivators grew frantic. Despite relentless attacks, the golden barrier held firm. The twelve gathered around Duan Fei, their de facto leader.

“This formation has a limit. If all twelve strike the same point five times, it’ll shatter. Follow my lead—unite your strength.” After repeated probes, Duan Fei concluded brute force was their only recourse against this demonic energy-absorbing barrier.

**BOOM!**

The violent impact shook the base. Liu Shilei, maintaining the formation, paled as one of the two lower-grade spirit stones at the core shattered.

“They’ve found the weakness! Miss Liu, what now?” The Five Elements Formation required minimal upkeep but constant elemental energy infusion.

“Prepare to retreat… Wait! Guan Yu’s back. Positions! Fetch Zhang Ziran. Has Miss Zuo returned?” Liu Shilei’s composure wavered like a rollercoaster.

This was her first time commanding a formation. Though only at Foundation Establishment, she’d sustained the Four Symbols Demon-Subduing Golden Light Formation using spirit stones. Yet her weak cultivation had created an unforeseen flaw—the barrier’s upper limit.

In a flash, Guan Yu teleported to the formation’s core via a preset spatial array.

“I’m sorry, Guan Yu. The formation…” Liu Shilei’s face betrayed panic, though remaining coherent amidst chaos was commendable for a novice.

**CRACK!**

The second strike echoed through the base as golden light dimmed further.

“Enough talk. Know why I chose the Four Symbols Formation? Because we have all four elements present. Is Zhang Ziran here?” Guan Yu’s fingers flicked, replacing spent spirit stones as he assumed control. Zhang Ziran, Zuo Qingyi, Dongfang Huowu, and Mo Ling materialized at the four cardinal nodes.

“Supreme Shield—Black Tortoise Manifestation, CONGEAL!”

**ROAR!**

A colossal Black Tortoise phantom materialized above the formation as Duan Fei’s group gathered for their final assault.

**Chapter 1187: The Grand Formation’s Demon-Slaying**

“Combine strength! Shatter this accursed formation!” Demon Sect techniques allowed pooling energies. Duan Fei, a swordsman, lacked such methods, but Blood Coagulation Sect’s Situ Lang stepped forward.

Though temporary empowerment brought prolonged weakness, the pseudo-Nascent Soul strength intoxicated Situ Lang. A bloody palm imprint coalesced midair as he savored his illusory omnipotence.

His euphoria shattered when a black-blue monstrosity devoured his attack. The serpentine phantom’s soul-crushing pressure left him dazed for three fatal seconds.

“The formation’s controller changed! Duan Fei, what now?” Situ Lang paled as fellow Golden Cores panicked.

“That strike reached early Nascent Soul level… What formation is this?” Duan Fei stared numbly at the radiant barrier, heart freezing like deep winter.

**SCREECH!**

The Black Tortoise dissipated. Vermilion Bird of the South emerged—rooster head, swallow wings, fish tail. Temperatures spiked unbearably even for cultivators before it dove, engulfing the arena in flames.

“Scatter! Use your trump cards now!” Duan Fei’s black sword drank the inferno as he chanted: “Nether Sword Art, Third Form!”

A terrifying blade aura erupted. Duan Fei transformed into black light, piercing the Vermilion Bird phantom.

**THUD!**

The phantom dissolved. “Not bad, Duan Fei. Let’s end this.” Guan Yu’s patience wore thin as spirit stones dwindled.

“Senior Zuo, it’s your turn.” Guan Yu hurled his last spirit stone. The formation blazed white.

“Friends, taste my final strike—White Tiger of the West, Frenzied Slaughter!”

**HOWL!**

A white-maned tiger disintegrated into countless sword beams, transforming the arena into a meat grinder.

“Gather!” Situ Tianjiao crushed a blood talisman, summoning a crimson cocoon. The protective shell eroded rapidly until a bell artifact bought three breaths before shattering.

“Flee separately!” Duan Fei’s pale face reflected dwindling numbers—twelve reduced to seven, then fewer.

“Guan Yu, I can’t sustain this!” Dongfang Huowu gasped. Golden Core energy couldn’t maintain hundred-meter suppression.

“Let the remnants go.” Guan Yu’s pallor matched hers. Ancient formations’ voracious energy demands explained their extinction—without spirit stones, such power required suicidal sacrifice.

**Chapter 1188: Aftermath**

Supporting the drained Dongfang Huowu and traumatized Mo Ling, Guan Yu noted their contrasting reactions. While Mo Ling trembled at her first kill, Dongfang Huowu burned with exhilaration.

“So this is cultivator combat? Brutal… I love it!” Her grin belied inner turmoil.

“We… we killed people!” Mo Ling stammered.

“They were evil! They’d have harmed countless others!” Dongfang Huowu insisted, seeking Guan Yu’s reassurance alongside Liu Shilei’s conflicted gaze.

“Perhaps harsh, but necessary.” Guan Yu sighed. “Senior Zuo, explain their crimes.”

Zuo Qingyi listed atrocities: infant stews, mass rapes, countless murders. The women’s guilt transformed into rage.

“These scum deserved death tenfold!” Liu Shilei hissed, staring at corpse fragments.

After sending the shaken trio to rest, Guan Yu confided in Zuo Qingyi and Zhang Ziran: “Was I wrong to drag them into this darkness?”

Zuo Qingyi’s icy eyes softened. “True love transcends worlds. They’ll understand.”

Zhang Ziran added, “Shared hardship forges unbreakable bonds. They’d grieve more if left behind.”

Changing subject, Guan Yu ordered: “Send distress signals. Demon Sect deployed twelve Golden Cores unchallenged—our intelligence failed spectacularly.”
