“If this matter becomes known in the martial world, it might affect the reputation of our Demon Soul Sect. Demon Lord, are you certain you wish to proceed?” asked the Left Envoy.

The Demon Lord stood and paced the room twice before replying, “Though I care little for reputation, the gifts from the other party are indeed tempting. I propose we send covert assassins without revealing our identities.”

“Go arrange this discreetly. Dispatch two branch hall leaders with subordinates to investigate Prince Zou's entourage first. We'll decide further actions afterward.”

The Left Envoy considered this plan feasible. As long as their identities remained concealed and no clues pointed to the Demon Soul Sect, there would be no issues. The target wouldn't know his assailants' origins anyway.

The Demon Lord added, “When the time comes, all blame shall fall upon the First and Second Princes. Regardless of outcome, we remain untainted. This plan is viable.”

As the Left Envoy bowed and turned to leave, the Demon Lord halted him. “Wait. Also deploy more agents to investigate Guan Yu's whereabouts. His recent silence troubles me. Prioritize this over Prince Zou's matter—they remain distant from the capital.”

“Understood. But regarding the Young Master's affairs during your seclusion...” The Left Envoy hesitated before posing the crucial question.

“For the assassination, I have an ideal candidate,” the Left Envoy continued. “Even if exposed, we need not fear repercussions.”

“Yan Zhao?” The Demon Lord pondered before nodding. “Excellent choice. Formerly of Yunqing Sect, his betrayal remains unknown to many. If discovered, we'll deny involvement and let Yunqing Sect bear the blame. Instruct him to gather intelligence first—eliminate Prince Zou decisively when ready.”

The Left Envoy agreed, “Yan Zhao will succeed. Prince Zou's guards should pose little threat—mere personal attendants and mediocre officials at best.”

“Do not underestimate him,” warned the Demon Lord. “Though expelled from Yunqing Sect years ago, he likely retains capable aides. Remember—he was once their disciple.”

Chapter 4035: Disguise

“What? Prince Zou was a Yunqing disciple?” The Left Envoy stared in shock. “This humble servant begs enlightenment.”

The Demon Lord chuckled, resuming his seat. “Long ago, Prince Zou saved the Emperor's life during an incognito excursion. For this deed, he received a princely title and fiefdom—supreme honor few refuse.”

“Yunqing Sect disapproved of his courtly ties, being the foremost orthodox sect. They expelled him, forbidding further use of their arts. Thus he became Prince of Liaozhou.”

“Though the Emperor's gratitude may have waned, this sudden summons suggests political turmoil. Hence Prince Zou's current peril.”

The Left Envoy sneered, “Yunqing should have crippled his cultivation before expulsion.”

“You misunderstand,” the Demon Lord countered. “This maintains covert ties—a princely ally proves useful. Consider this: Guan Yu, Xiao Zhi, and Wang Jun's disappearance coincides with Prince Zou's journey. Could Yunqing have sent them as covert guards?”

“Likely true!” The Demon Lord's eyes gleamed. “If Yan Zhao discovers them protecting the prince, we'll expose Yunqing's hypocrisy! Their reputation shall crumble before the entire martial world!”

After dismissing the Left Envoy, the Demon Lord's agent found Yan Zhao—recently promoted to branch leader—tasking him with scouting Prince Zou's retinue for Yunqing operatives.

Chapter 4036: Rather Amusing

Meanwhile, Guan Yu's group followed Prince Zou's procession. At dusk, after brief respite, the horses flagged. Zou Wuhui called halt near wooded foothills. “We'll rest here before entering the forest,” she advised the prince.

Guan Yu remarked uneasily, “This calm feels ominous. We should disguise ourselves—our conspicuous presence risks exposure.”

Xiao Zhi grimaced. “Disguises chafe, but necessity rules.”

After obtaining permission, the trio entered the prince's lavish carriage. Wang Jun marveled at fur-lined furnishings while Guan Yu distributed costumes. “I'll play patriarch—you two as my children.”

“You rooster!” Xiao Zhi protested before relenting. An hour's transformation yielded an elderly merchant, his “son” Cang Ge, and “daughter” Cang Mei.

Prince Zou chuckled at their personas. “Excellent! I shall address you as Old Cang.”

As twilight deepened, Zou Wuhui reported scouts finding no threats ahead. “We'll reach Ao Tian Manor by midnight.”

The procession advanced toward darkening woods. Guan Yu suggested dispersing soldiers as scouts. “Better some die scouting than all perish in ambush.”

Twenty men fanned out as shadows lengthened. The forest loomed—its depths hiding unknown perils. Prince Zou steeled himself, knowing retreat meant treason. Survival demanded pressing forward.

Chapter 4037: Power Distribution

Guan Yu explained his strategy: “Enemies know our numbers. By scattering forces, we might disrupt their plans. Any scout surviving could reveal their positions.”

The prince approved, dispatching explorers. As they entered the tree line, moonlight dappled the path. Guan Yu's disguised trio maintained vigilance, aware this tranquility foreshadowed storm.
