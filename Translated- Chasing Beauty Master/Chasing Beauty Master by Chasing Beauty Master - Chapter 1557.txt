When the assassins arrived, Guan Yu and his companions naturally prioritized protecting the prince, leaving no chance to attend to others. To counter the imminent ambush, Guan Yu rode on the left flank of the carriage, Wang Jun guarded the right, and Xiao Zhi trailed behind. The remaining soldiers formed ranks at the front and rear, while Zou Wuhui and Zou Wuxiao perched atop the carriage. The entire entourage had shifted into defensive formation, their pace deliberately slowed as they strained to listen for movements within the forest.

Nightfall draped the woods in profound silence, broken only by the rhythmic clop of hooves. Guan Yu issued instructions: “Zou Wuhui, if enemies strike, your first duty is to help His Highness mount the prepared steed. We’ll cover the rear and carve an escape path. Understood?” His meaning was clear—priority lay in the prince’s swift flight, with tactical considerations deferred until assessing enemy numbers. A swift horse already stood tethered beside the royal carriage, ready to outpace any pursuit.

“Once His Highness is mounted,” Guan Yu continued, “you’ll lead his escape. Zou Wuxiao, divert attention by driving the carriage in the opposite direction. This moonless night should aid our ruse.” The strategy met unanimous approval. Prince Zou nodded gravely: “Execute as Guan Yu commands. No hesitation when the moment comes.”

Though confident in Wang Jun and Xiao Zhi’s combat prowess, Guan Yu worried for the soldiers’ survival. Of Magistrate Mao’s original thirty guards, half now scouted ahead while the remainder trailed the procession. Approaching a squad leader, Guan Yu advised: “If engaged, scatter immediately. Regroup at Sky Proud Manor—preserve your lives above all.”

“But abandoning His Highness—” the soldier protested.
“His safety is our charge,” Guan Yu cut in. “Fleeing preserves future strength.” He knew common soldiers stood no chance against hired martial artists. Their best hope lay in the coordinated retreat of three commanders, the Zou brothers, and himself protecting the prince.

“Old Cang,” Prince Zou called, still adjusting to Guan Yu’s pseudonym. As the strategist approached, the prince requested: “When attackers reveal themselves, note any identifying marks. Tell me—what forces might the princes deploy against us?”

Guan Yu posed his own question: “Your Highness, clarify the royal factions. The Eldest Prince’s incompetence is common knowledge—does his mother Guifen truly command his faction?”

“Indeed,” the prince confirmed. “Guifen colludes with Eunuch Yu Kong, commander of the elite palace guard. The Second Prince openly controls the Imperial Guards through Minister Qi, and recently allied with Chancellor Li, who commands the royal garrison.”

Nodding, Guan Yu concluded: “Present attackers likely belong to the Second Prince’s faction—probably Imperial Guards. Exposing their treason could force royal intervention.” Though dubious of this approach, the prince deferred to his protector’s judgment.

As midnight deepened, scouts began disappearing. Zou Wuhui reported dwindling patrol returns. “Expected,” Guan Yu acknowledged. “They stalk us from shadows. Our hilltop position offers temporary safety—assassins won’t strike here.”

Wang Jun proposed camping until dawn, but Guan Yu countered: “Night favors both predator and prey. Darkness masks our flight when needed.” He adjusted tactics, sending paired scouts compass-wise to pinpoint enemy positions through their absence.

The prince marveled at Guan Yu’s strategic mind—this mysterious protector had become his indispensable pillar. As the caravan descended the wooded slope, Xiao Zhi’s drowsy complaints drew Wang Jun’s mockery: “Sleep here and you’ll wake dead or diseased!”

“Then chat with me,” Xiao Zhi grumbled.
“Five coins’ worth of chatter,” Wang jested, palm outstretched.
“Bandit!” Xiao retorted, though secretly grateful for the wakeful banter.

Scouts confirmed the eastern flank’s danger as missing pairs revealed enemy positioning. Guan Yu pushed the group onward, eyes fixed on Sky Proud Manor’s promise of sanctuary. Through calculated risks and unspoken trust, the embattled procession pressed through the conspiratorial night.
