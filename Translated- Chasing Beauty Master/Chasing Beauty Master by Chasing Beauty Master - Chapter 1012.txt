Chapter 2587: The Great Iron Rod

The three experts sent by Bill Lin were long-time elite bodyguards of the Bill family, usually serving as Bill Lin’s personal guards.

The one who had spoken with Young Master Feng earlier was the strongest among them—a Second-Class Upper Rank expert named Ha Da. Having lost his left eye while protecting Bill Lin, Ha Da always wore sunglasses.

Another was a dark-skinned muscular man who appeared somewhat Western, towering with explosive muscles that made him look immensely imposing. Named Ha Er, he also possessed Second-Class Rank strength.

The third was a middle-aged woman named Ha San. Short and plump, barely reaching 1.5 meters in height, with a round face and cropped yellow hair, her unremarkable appearance belied her formidable cultivation nearing Second-Class Middle Rank.

These three had served as Bill Lin’s loyal bodyguards for years, known among insiders as the three guardian siblings of the Bill family.

After giving instructions, Young Master Feng stepped out of the car and followed behind the trio, feeling assured. Though he had never seen them fight, their reputation preceded them.

Young Master Feng thought, “Even if these three are strong, they might not match Guan Yu. But if they can breach the courtyard and open the gates, our numbers will overwhelm him. Today, we’ll seize Guan Yu and claim the treasure map!”

Approaching the temple gates, he ordered, “Once inside, prioritize opening the main gate. Once my men flood in, the rest will be easy. Understood?”

“Young Master Feng, could you brief us on the situation inside? How many opponents are there?” Ha San asked.

“You’d better ask my head guard,” Young Master Feng replied, summoning his captain.

The captain explained, “There are six or seven inside. They’ve piled bricks by the walls—any attempt to scale them gets met with projectiles. Even if we break through, a strongman hurls us back out.”

Ha Er’s eyes lit up with excitement. Flexing his chest muscles, he grinned, “A strongman? Leave him to me. I love a good clash of brute force!”

“Rest assured, Young Master Feng. We’ll handle this. Please wait at the rear,” Ha Da said courteously.

Young Master Feng marveled at their polished demeanor, resolving to acquire such refined bodyguards himself someday.

As he retreated, Ha Da instructed, “We’ll enter together. Ha Er and I will engage the enemies. Ha San, remove the gate bolt immediately. Our mission is to open those doors. Clear?”

“Clear!” Ha Er and Ha San chorused.

Inside the courtyard, Guan Yu overheard the final exchange. Frowning, he warned, “They’re sending experts to breach the gate. Once it’s open, their forces will swarm in.”

“Too late—they’re already here,” Xue Jing interjected, suddenly standing with two bricks in hand. With a flick of her wrists, the projectiles whistled through the air toward three figures leaping onto the wall—the Ha siblings.

Ha Da casually swung his great iron rod, smashing the incoming bricks to dust.

Guan Yu rose swiftly. “Xue Jing, guard the gate! Brothers, hold your ground two against one!”

The three invaders landed in the courtyard. Ha San lunged for the gate but found Xue Jing’s foot already aimed at her kidney. Forced to abandon her advance, Ha San twisted aside, engaging Xue Jing in unarmed combat.

Meanwhile, Ha Er charged toward Big Beard, who brandished a fifty-jin iron rod—a source of personal pride as the heaviest weapon he knew. Yet Ha Er’s matching rod sparked competitive fury. “Damn! Let’s see whose rod prevails!” Big Beard roared, swinging downward.

“Bring it on!” Ha Er roared back, blocking the strike.

CLANG! The collision sent sparks flying and ears ringing. Both men staggered back, arms numb.

“Not bad!” Ha Er gasped, exhilarated. “Finally, a worthy match!”

Though Big Beard’s cultivation was inferior, his raw strength matched Ha Er’s. The two titans clashed repeatedly, rods clanging like war drums.

Xue Jing pressed Ha San relentlessly. Within moments, Ha San was forced into defense. A sharp jab to the jaw dislocated it, sending teeth flying. As Ha San collapsed, Xue Jing moved to finish her—only for the wounded woman to spring up, spitting blood and charging madly.

CRACK! Xue Jing seized Ha San’s arm, twisting it until bone snapped. The scream chilled even the guards outside.

Outside, Young Master Feng panicked at the commotion. His captain suggested, “While they’re distracted, storm the walls! They can’t throw bricks and fight at once.”

Nodding, Feng ordered his men forward while hiding in a car.

As Ha San crumpled, fresh waves of guards scaled the walls. Xue Jing and Wei Hongwei resumed their brick barrage, but numbers overwhelmed them. Several invaders dropped into the courtyard.

Inside, three battlefronts raged: Ha Da fended off Shen Sheng and allies with ease until reinforcements arrived; Ha Er and Big Beard’s earth-shaking duel; and Xue Jing’s systematic dismantling of Ha San.

Big Beard’s arms trembled from exertion, Ha Er equally spent. “Your strength…impressive,” the former panted. “I’ve never met my equal—until today.”

Ha Er grinned through heaving breaths. “Likewise. This…is a fight worth remembering.”

Nearby, Wei Hongwei crouched by bricks, bemused by their mutual admiration.

Xue Jing’s fight had shifted to the courtyard center. A vicious hook sent Ha San sprawling again. As Xue Jing moved to incapacitate her, the injured woman erupted in a final, desperate charge—only to meet a bone-snapping counter.

The Ha siblings’ plight worsened as Feng’s guards renewed their assault. Though bricks felled many, the tide kept coming.

Chapter 2588: A Proper Showdown

“Come! Let’s settle this!” Big Beard challenged, hefting his rod despite exhaustion.

Ha Er leaped skyward, rod descending like a meteor. Big Beard braced—

CRASH! The impact numbed his arms, nearly disarming him. Xiao Bai caught his stumble.

Seizing the moment, Ha Er pressed forward—only to face two opponents. Xiao Bai’s darting attacks forced him to split attention.

Guan Yu barked orders: “Xiao Bai, aid Shen Sheng! Big Beard, hold on!”

The trio against Ha Da coordinated flawlessly, driving the expert back temporarily. Yet the courtyard trembled under Ha Er and Big Beard’s ongoing duel, each clash echoing like thunder.

Xue Jing finally crippled Ha San with an arm break, but fresh invaders streamed over walls. The defenders’ brick barrage resumed, bloodying faces yet failing to stem the flood.

Chapter 2589: Bitter Hatred

Ha San’s agonized wail galvanized the attackers. Young Master Feng’s captain rallied guards: “Now’s our chance! They’re distracted!”

As Feng cowered, his men scaled walls—only to meet Guan Yu and Xue Jing’s renewed projectile onslaught. Yet sheer numbers prevailed; several guards breached the courtyard.

Amidst the chaos, Ha Er and Big Beard’s contest reached its peak—two bulls locking horns, rods bent, muscles screaming. Neither would yield, their rivalry transcending enmity.

Xue Jing’s victory over Ha San came at a cost—precious moments lost as invaders multiplied. Guan Yu’s gaze swept the battlefield, strategizing their dwindling options.

The temple’s fate hung on a razor’s edge, steel clashing, bricks flying, and the bitter tang of blood thick in the air.
