He still couldn’t comprehend how Guan Yu’s strength had surged so dramatically in such a short time. Yet, unwilling to accept defeat at the hands of someone he’d once considered beneath him, Hu Xiaohai scrambled to his feet and roared, “Barbaric Charge!” before lunging at Guan Yu. He aimed to exploit his own hardened physique—honed during his Qi Refining Stage, where he’d condensed silvery streaks amidst the dominant black patterns—to crush his opponent. Even if his metallic hues were faint, they still far surpassed ordinary cultivators!

Seeing Hu Xiaohai rise again to attack, Guan Yu’s patience snapped. A ruthless glint flashed in his eyes as he shouted, “Hu Xiaohai! You brought this upon yourself with your relentless provocation. Since you crave battle, I’ll oblige! You think your body is unbreakable? Let me show you true resilience!”

“Boom!” As Guan Yu’s voice faded, he unleashed the full might of his Qi Refining Stage physique. Spiritual energy erupted from his body, transforming his skin from golden to radiant silver, shimmering with an ethereal glow.

Hu Xiaohai froze mid-charge, stunned by the disparity between their strengths. Panicking, he tried to halt his assault—but Guan Yu, now enraged, gave him no quarter. In a single stride, he closed the distance.

“No—!” Hu Xiaohai’s terrified scream echoed too late. A thunderous “Crash!” reverberated as Guan Yu’s collision sent him hurtling a hundred meters before he crumpled to the ground. Hu Xiaohai’s lackeys stared in horror, shaken by Guan Yu’s overwhelming power.

Only when their leader lay motionless did they snap into action, rushing to his side. The once-arrogant Hu Xiaohai now lay broken, his body fissured and bleeding. Seizing the moment, the two sisters grabbed Guan Yu and fled downhill.

By the time the entourage recovered, Guan Yu had vanished. Opting not to pursue, they hastily carried Hu Xiaohai away—knowing the Zhang Clan would hold them accountable if he perished from untreated injuries.

Panting from their sprint, Guan Yu and the sisters reached their doorstep. “Phew… We’re alive!” gasped the elder sister. “Thank you, Brother Guan Yu. Without you, we’d never have obtained the Crimson Sun Grass. But injuring Hu Xiaohai… The Zhangs won’t let this go. You must stay vigilant.”

“Fear not,” Guan Yu reassured her. “Hu Xiaohai’s tyranny earned him this lesson. Had I stood idle today, I’d never forgive myself—even if it meant defeat. How could I abandon my sisters?” His gaze softened as he recalled Aunt Xue’s lifelong hardships and kindness. He vowed to one day uplift her family with his strength.

“Hehe, Brother Guan Yu always protects us!” the sisters chimed, playfully clinging to him.

“Enough,” he chuckled. “Take the herb to your mother. Aunt Xue’s condition should improve.”

Nodding, they scampered off. Watching them leave, Guan Yu frowned. Provoking the Zhang Clan meant trouble. He’d need caution in future outings. Heading inside, he found his father, Guan Xiao, waiting. The man beamed at his son’s meteoric rise from Body Tempering Fifth Layer to Qi Refining First Layer in mere days.

“Qi Refining First Layer. Impressive. You’ve worked hard—no disgrace to our name,” Guan Xiao praised.

Guan Yu blinked, surprised his father discerned his cultivation level so swiftly. But given Guan Xiao’s prowess, such perception was natural. “Of course. How could I surpass you if I lagged behind your youth?” he teased.

Guan Xiao feigned offense. “Brat! Mocking your old man? Need a lesson in respect?” He raised a mock-threatening palm.

“Wait! Just a joke!” Guan Yu backpedaled. “Who could rival your genius, Father?”

Snorting at the flattery, Guan Xiao demanded, “Enough. Demonstrate your Turtle Breathing Technique and Fist Force.”

Sobering, Guan Yu cycled spiritual energy through his dantian with practiced ease. Guan Xiao nodded approvingly—the boy had mastered the technique far quicker than expected.

Next, Guan Yu channeled energy into his arms, unleashing a flurry of punches. Spiritual ripples cascaded from his fists, each strike whistling through air. Guan Xiao’s eyes widened. The seamless fusion of energy and brute force surpassed even his own past mastery.

Lost in the rhythm, Guan Yu pivoted and slammed a straight punch into a towering tree. With a deafening “Crash!”, the trunk snapped midair. Both father and son gaped as the colossal tree toppled toward their home.

In a blur, Guan Xiao shot skyward. Catching the falling trunk, his fist—wreathed in primordial energy—shattered it to splinters. Guan Yu stared, awestruck. The enhanced Fist Force with primordial energy dwarfed spiritual power alone. It ignited his resolve to reach Martial Master realm.

Descending, Guan Xiao noted his son’s fiery determination. His display had served its purpose: to remind Guan Yu that true strength lay in relentless innovation. The boy’s epiphany pleased him—his son’s comprehension surpassed even his own youth.

Their silent pride was interrupted by a melodic voice: “Uncle Xiao! Long time no see! Xueyan missed you!”

Turning, Guan Xiao grinned at his niece. “Still the sweet-talker. How do I know you’re sincere?”

Guan Xueyan—daughter of Guan Xiao’s cousin Guan Lei—bounced over. Though Guan Xiao had split from the main family, bonds with kin like Lei endured. Their childhood camaraderie had weathered even Guan Xiao’s exile, with Lei secretly aiding him during lean years.

“Xueyan! Did you sneak out again?” Guan Yu teased.

“N-No! I just…” Her stammer betrayed her.

“Ah, Uncle Lei’s angry again?” Guan Yu prodded.

“Stupid Guan Yu!” She stomped his foot and ducked behind Guan Xiao. “Uncle! He bullies me!”

Guan Yu glared, but Guan Xiao’s mock-stern look deterred retaliation. Their childhood dynamic hadn’t changed—Xueyan remained the pampered troublemaker.

“Enough,” Guan Xiao sighed. “Xueyan, why are you here? Truth.”

Her playfulness dissolved. Tears welled as she choked, “The Clan Head… wants me to marry Li Chuang of the Li Clan. To strengthen family ties. But I… I don’t love him!”

Rage erupted from Guan Xiao. Primordial energy exploded outward, scattering debris. “They dare?!” he thundered.

Xueyan sobbed into his chest. “Father tried to refuse, but… The Lis blackmailed us! They’re connected to the imperial court. If we don’t comply, our clan faces annihilation!”

Guan Lei’s voice trembled as he joined them. “The Li heir became obsessed after seeing Xueyan. They exploited our recent loss of the Qilin Pills meant for the Emperor. Without Li support, our Guan Clan… will be erased from Qingyang Ancient Town.”

Xueyan’s whimpers pierced the air. “Why must it be me? I’d rather die than wed that monster!”

Guan Yu clenched his fists. This injustice wouldn’t stand. Not while he breathed.
