“Ah? She went to Qianhui Peak for the match?” Xiao Zhi exclaimed in surprise. “Aiya, how could I not know? Had I known earlier, I should’ve gone to cheer her on.”

Aze had already stepped onto the platform, awaiting his turn. Xiao Zhi suddenly rushed over, about to speak, but Aze waved his hand first. “No need to explain. Couldn’t find Siqi, could you? Any idea where she went?”

“Siqi went to Qianhui Peak for her match,” Xiao Zhi replied honestly.

“Go if you want. Even without your cheers here, I’ll still win. Typical of you—abandoning friendship for a girl. Had you known Siqi wasn’t here, you’d never have come,” Aze said disdainfully.

At the same time, Aze shook his head helplessly. Xiao Zhi’s infatuation with Siqi had been evident for over a decade. Though his feelings were sincere, fate seemed to conspire against them. Every potential meeting was thwarted by unexpected circumstances.

Over the years, Xiao Zhi’s visits to Convergence Peak to see Siqi rarely succeeded—either she was away on missions, in seclusion, or Dai Shouzhu’s foul mood barred visitors. Thus, Xiao Zhi’s unrequited love persisted, likely unnoticed by Siqi herself.

Aze had long believed Xiao Zhi’s chances were slim even before Guan Yu arrived. Siqi, revered as the goddess of Cloud Azure Sect’s male disciples, drew admiration from countless suitors. Among them, Xiao Zhi was but a face in the crowd, unremarkable save for his unique doppelgänger technique. Now, with Guan Yu’s arrival, even that faint hope had vanished.

Before Guan Yu, Aze thought Siqi’s eventual choice remained uncertain and had tried to help Xiao Zhi court her. But Guan Yu’s presence eclipsed all rivals. Not only had he erased Xiao Zhi’s chances, but he’d also overshadowed every male disciple in the sect. Notably, Siqi—never one to accept gifts—had made an exception for Guan Yu’s offerings, hinting at her favor.

Guan Yu’s privileged status, even lodging overnight at Convergence Peak under Dai Shouzhu’s rare hospitality, cemented his advantage. Aze now worried Xiao Zhi’s hopeless devotion would only deepen his anguish, potentially twisting into something darker.

“Aze, you know me best. I *do* want to go, but Siqi’s match has likely started. With the Liu Feng Grand Assembly permitting sword flight, I’d arrive too late. So I’ll stay and cheer for you,” Xiao Zhi declared, clapping Aze’s shoulder with forced cheer.

Aze sighed inwardly. Time and again, improbable misfortunes kept Xiao Zhi and Siqi apart. “Brotherly advice,” Aze said, returning the shoulder pat. “Why cling to a single tree? You know Siqi will end up with Guan Yu. What’s the point?”

“I understand,” Xiao Zhi replied solemnly. “I’ll keep myself in check. Don’t worry.”

As dejected Zuokong Peak disciples filed out from a lost match, an announcer boomed: “Next bout—Aze of Suspended Central Peak versus Xiaochun of Convergence Peak! Combatants, approach!”

“Aze, you’ve got this!” Xiao Zhi shouted. Nodding, Aze stepped forward as Xiaochun mirrored him from the opposite side.

“Don’t lose to a woman!” Xiao Zhi added, provoking glares from Convergence Peak’s female disciples.

Xiaochun retorted, “What’s wrong with losing to a woman? Your pompous attitude can’t mask your weakness! You couldn’t beat Siqi either!”

Cowed by the collective hostility, Xiao Zhi bowed apologetically. Reasoning with angered women was folly—better to appease them preemptively.

Aze flashed a confident thumbs-up. Internally, Xiao Zhi fretted. Xiaochun, Dai Shouzhu’s top disciple, was formidable. Though Aze was Suspended Central’s pride, this match carried their peak’s reputation.

The crowd’s roar swelled as combat commenced. Convergence’s female disciples drowned out Suspended Central’s cheers with piercing cries. On the platform, Aze and Xiaochun exchanged formal bows.

Courteously, Aze gestured for Xiaochun to strike first. She acknowledged with a slight bow, then raised her Cloud Azure Sword skyward. Dark clouds churned overhead, lightning crackling within.

Aze responded defensively, his blade conjuring a golden barrier. Xiaochun’s Skyburst Art gathered power—a deceptively thrifty spell requiring time to harness storm energy. Unaware, Aze’s caution played into her strategy.

“Take this!” Xiaochun cried, unleashing a lightning strike. Aze’s barrier absorbed the bolt silently, drawing cheers from his faction.

Yet Aze had expended double her spiritual energy—a tactical loss masked as victory. Undeterred, Suspended Central’s disciples chanted: “Blocked well, blocked smart, blocked till the thunder stops!”

Xiao Zhi egged him on: “Show no mercy! Crush that woman!”—earning fresh glares.

“Must you bellow like buffoons?” a Convergence disciple snapped.

“We’ve as much right to cheer!” a Suspended Central junior retorted.

Chaos erupted when he addressed them as “elder sisters”—a fatal faux pas. The women descended, outraged at being called aged. Xiao Zhi winced as verbal barrages rained, knowing logic couldn’t stem this storm.
