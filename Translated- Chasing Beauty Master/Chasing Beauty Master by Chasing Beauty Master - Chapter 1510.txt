“Young Master Li shouted, ‘Who do you think you are? How dare you speak to my father like that! Let me tell you, even if the Prefect himself were here, he’d have to show my father respect. Let alone a petty captain like you! I’ll remember you, and I swear you’ll pay for this!’”



As for Young Master Li’s naked threats, Captain Yu paid them no mind. For now, he still didn’t fully understand the extent of Elder Li’s influence—whether the man truly held the power his son boasted of.



Captain Yu glanced at Guanyu and continued sternly, “I don’t care if you’re Elder Li or some ‘Lord Li.’ This is the magistrate’s hall! How dare you cause a scene here!”



“This Captain Yu speaks boldly indeed! How many years have you served in the Prefect’s office? Don’t you recognize me?” Elder Li growled, his voice low and dangerous.



“Who you are is none of my concern,” Captain Yu retorted coldly. “Young Master Li and Magistrate Pang are implicated in crimes. Do you intend to interfere? If not, leave at once. This is no place for your insolence.”



Captain Yu met Elder Li’s gaze without flinching. Though not usually so assertive, the hostages’ earlier encouragement had steeled him. Today, he’d done righteous work—arresting villains. On this path of justice, he feared no one.



Truth be told, Captain Yu was accustomed to taking bribes. Anyone seeking his favor had to grease his palm first. But Elder Li, ignorant of such customs, had stormed in shouting demands. Naturally, Captain Yu showed him no courtesy.



Guanyu stayed silent, content to watch the spectacle unfold. This drama seemed unrelated to him—for now.



“Father! They’re about to take me away!” Young Master Li cried desperately. “You must save me! Don’t let them torture a false confession out of me!”



Elder Li looked at his son with bitter resignation. The boy’s recklessness had brought this upon himself. Despite countless warnings, the willful heir had refused to listen. Now, caught in disaster, he begged for rescue. Served him right.



Yet Elder Li saw the genuine fear in his son’s eyes. Perhaps this harsh lesson would reform him. For now, salvaging family honor took priority. Though furious, Elder Li patted his son’s shoulder. “As your father, I won’t let you suffer unjustly.”



Noticing Guanyu, Elder Li pointed. “Aren’t you the Luo heir from Qujiang City? If I recall correctly?”



Guanyu met his gaze evenly. “Your memory serves, Elder Li. You remember my masquerade as ‘Young Master Luo’? But I apologize—that was merely a guise. My true purpose lay elsewhere.”



“To investigate my son, no doubt?” Elder Li’s eyes narrowed. “Did you orchestrate this?”



“You’re half-right,” Guanyu replied. “I came to investigate the disappearances. My visit to your estate was but a step toward uncovering the rot in this magistrate’s office. Through luck, I discovered your son and Magistrate Pang’s atrocities and reported them to the Prefect.”



“Admirable,” Elder Li sneered. “What do you gain from this crusade? Justice? Or personal profit?”



“Justice needs no reward,” Guanyu said coldly. “Scum like your son and Magistrate Pang deserve death. No excuses needed.”



Elder Li turned to Captain Yu. “What exactly has my son done to warrant such a spectacle?”



Captain Yu gestured at Xiaomei and the others. “These women were rescued from an underground dungeon in the magistrate’s compound. They’ve testified against your son and Magistrate Pang. Human trafficking is no small crime, Elder Li.”



Elder Li fell silent. This was dire. While wealth could smooth over minor offenses, trafficking—now exposed to the Prefect—was beyond bribery. The scandal threatened his entire family.



“My son would never commit such atrocities!” Elder Li protested. “This must be a misunderstanding!”



Guanyu pointed at the rescued women. “They were imprisoned here and directly identified your son. Will you still deny it? Speak now, Young Master Li—your last chance.”



“You’ve brought strangers to frame me!” Young Master Li shouted. “These women mean nothing!”



Guanyu ignored him, addressing Magistrate Pang. “They were found in your dungeon. Explain.”



Magistrate Pang, desperate, turned to Elder Li. “You know of our dealings! Help us!”



“Do not drag my son into your sins!” Elder Li snapped. “Your crimes are yours alone!”



The room erupted into chaos—accusations flew like daggers. Guanyu watched, amused, as the conspirators turned on each other. Their lies unraveled with every word.



Captain Yu silenced the uproar. “Enough! Let the witnesses speak!”



The rescued women trembled forward. Captain Yu glared at them. “Speak truthfully. Any lies will be met with thirty lashes!”



Under pressure, their testimonies exposed the grim truth: Young Master Li and Magistrate Pang had trafficked women as slaves for profit. The evidence was irrefutable.



As the damning words flowed, even Elder Li’s bluster crumbled. His son’s guilt was laid bare—a web of greed and cruelty that entangled them all.
