“This day is one of the Ghost Festivals in the year. Originally, the entire imperial palace retinue would visit the royal mausoleum for worship. However, several decades ago during these very days, the current Son of Heaven was born.”

Though much was said, Guan Yu knew well that the first day of the tenth lunar month wasn’t considered auspicious. Back in Huaxia, people would burn paper offerings and money on this day. He hadn’t expected the same custom here.

“This Meng Hua Patriarch truly stirs trouble,” Guan Yu mused. “Could he have made a mistake when leaving clues? Snowfall on the tenth day of the tenth month is impossible – even in northern regions, for the weather isn’t cold enough yet.”

Suddenly struck by inspiration, Guan Yu hastily proposed, “Master, esteemed uncles, have you considered these words were left by Patriarch Meng Hua over a millennium ago? The reigning emperor’s birthday at that time might differ completely. Perhaps the Patriarch referred to the emperor of his era. What do you think?”

“Brilliant point, Guan Yu!” Chief Lu exclaimed. “Though formidable, even Patriarch Meng Hua couldn’t have foreseen the current emperor’s birthday a millennium later. These verses must refer to the emperor of his time. By verifying historical records of imperial birthdays from that period, we could pinpoint the divine technique’s manifestation date.”

Chapter 4685: Severe Punishment

“Reasoned indeed. Yet how shall we determine which emperor the Patriarch referenced?” Xuan Ming frowned. “With such vast temporal distance, not only are historical records scarce, but we lack even the year when Patriarch Meng Hua created the Eight-Sided Drum Technique. This leaves us without starting point.”

The complexity became apparent. Millennia-old imperial courts had faded from memory, their rulers forgotten. None knew when exactly the Patriarch visited the capital, making this investigative path fruitless.

Guan Yu offered, “Master, I believe the verses’ essence remains valid – the divine technique manifests during snowfall. Let us dispatch observers to the capital immediately while gradually investigating the Patriarch’s history. This dual approach seems our only recourse.”

His proposal served dual purposes: escaping idle days at Yunqing Sect and avoiding Xuan Ming’s assignments. Securing the Eight-Sided Drum Technique in the capital became urgent – with two techniques already obtained, two more might break the seal in his mind. Moreover, arranging Xiao Mei’s affairs and slowly building his Jianghu influence required this assignment.

“So be it,” Xuan Ming acquiesced. “Rest for several days. We’ll consult elders about the Patriarch’s affairs.”

Bowing, Guan Yu pressed, “Master, I volunteer to investigate in the capital. The imperial archives might record significant events from the Patriarch’s visit.”

After consideration, Xuan Ming nodded. “Depart after recuperating. Your acquaintance there – Prince Zou – might assist if needed.”

As the group prepared to leave, Ling Su entered – Guan Yu’s least welcome sight. The disheveled disciple resembled a ragpicker, wrapped in burlap with grime-covered face and matted hair. Suppressed snickers filled the hall.

Having trekked penniless from deserts, Ling Su knelt before the fuming Xuan Ming. “You dare return? Your conduct shames my trust!”

“Master, what fault?” Ling Su implored. “My plight stems from disagreements with Guan Yu, who nearly killed me! This ingrate now slanders me?”

“Guan Yu spoke no ill,” Xuan Ming retorted coldly. “Facts condemn you. What contributions did you make? What service to our sect?”

Ling Su paled, having achieved nothing post-separation from Guan Yu’s group. Before he could act in Miao City, nightfall triggered their expulsion.

“Worse, you squandered sect funds gambling!” Xuan Ming’s wrath intensified. “You merit bamboo forest punishment!”

Unbeknownst to Ling Su, Lin Chen had preemptively blamed him for gambling losses and brothel visits. Tearfully, Ling Su protested, “I gambled personal silver! Lin Chen managed funds, losing hundreds plus borrowed sums!”

Xuan Ming’s confusion deepened as disciples accused each other. Turning to Guan Yu, he demanded truth.

Guan Yu observed Ling Su’s pleading expression impassantly. “Brother Ling repeatedly obstructed our mission. His desert interference nearly doomed us all. As for Lin Chen – he lost eight hundred taels gambling, deceitfully requested more funds, then attempted assault on a maiden.”

Xuan Ming’s face darkened. “Disgraceful! Chief Mu, detain both per sect rules. No leniency without my order!”

With the offenders confined to Bamboo Forest Peak, Guan Yu inspected crossbow improvements at Tiger Head Peak’s rear woods. Stable prototypes now existed, with disciples training for mass production – promising enhanced sect strength.

Days later, Wang Jun’s boisterous entrance interrupted Guan Yu’s sleep. “Rise! See who’s come!”

Through groggy eyes, Guan Yu recognized Du Bingyan and Xiao Zhi. “You brought your lady here! Congratulations indeed!”

Xiao Zhi scratched his head. “I hope Father accepts Bingyan into the sect. She’s kinless now.”

“Delighted to reunite,” Du Bingyan murmured shyly, her refined appearance contrasting past street urchin days. Guan Yu recalled chasing her across rooftops – skills born from survival, not formal training.

“You cost us dearly before,” Guan Yu chuckled. “But fate smiles. Let’s visit Chief Zheng after I dress.”

En route to Suspended Peak, Guan Yu pondered complications. Du Bingyan’s existing internal energy might preclude orthodox cultivation. While marriage to Xiao Zhi seemed assured, sect membership remained uncertain. Precedent allowed spouses joining respective masters’ peaks, but exceptions challenged traditions.

As they departed, Wang Jun updated detainees’ status: “Endlessly copying sect rules in Bamboo Forest. Typical punishment – worst being expulsion.”

“Better than torture chambers,” Guan Yu remarked. “Maimed disciples help none.”

The group proceeded, Guan Yu aware that Du Bingyan’s acceptance hinged on Chief Zheng’s influence and Xuan Ming’s flexibility. Her presence would test Yunqing’s regulations, but love’s path often carved through stone.
