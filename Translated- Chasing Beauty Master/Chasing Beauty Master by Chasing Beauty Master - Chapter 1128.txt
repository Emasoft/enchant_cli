“Tsk, you really know how to act all high and mighty, don’t you? Fine, I’ll see what the hell you’re capable of today!”

Wang Erzi brandished the weapon in his hand and charged at Guanyu, abandoning any pretense of dignity. Sometimes, impressing a beauty required brute force.

He thought to himself that once he beat this wretched kid to the ground, the lovely girl would surely submit. Some women were just despicable—they only wanted to cling to powerful men.

In the blink of an eye, Wang’s weapon swung toward Guanyu. Guanyu pivoted, narrowly dodging the attack. Wang’s movements were sluggish, his pudgy body betraying a life of indolence. After evading the strike, Guanyu swiftly lifted his leg and kicked Wang squarely in the groin.

“Agh! You bastard…you kicked my damn jewels!” Wang howled. His excitement upon seeing Ling’er’s beauty had already stirred his “treasure,” but Guanyu’s merciless strike nearly severed the pathetic appendage.

Guanyu hadn’t held back. If that thing had been over five centimeters, it would’ve snapped clean off. But judging by the barely noticeable bulge in Wang’s pants, the “jewel” was laughably minuscule.

Wang crumpled to his knees, tears streaming from the pain. Ling’er stifled a gleeful laugh behind Guanyu. Unfazed, Guanyu ignored Wang’s agony. Old Sun, however, grew anxious. These uniformed thugs always bullied others with impunity.

Guanyu had crossed a line by injuring one so severely. Old Sun, despite his own leg wound, urged, “Guanyu, let me handle this. Pretend you weren’t here—leave quickly!”

Guanyu understood Old Sun’s desire to protect him but shook his head firmly. He wasn’t afraid of trivial consequences.

Ling’er, who had lived in Pan Taisheng’s apartment complex for years, often crossed paths with Old Sun at the guardhouse. Though they rarely spoke, she respected the old man deeply.

“Old Sun, let Guanyu handle this,” Ling’er declared resolutely. “That brute can’t touch him. Look at the boy’s face—they can’t get away with this!”

Old Sun relented. He longed for justice, even if it risked implicating Guanyu.

Wang, red-faced and sobbing, spat through gritted teeth, “You…you’ll pay for this, bastard!”

Guanyu smirked. “Oh? Do your worst.”

Wang lay immobilized, sweat drenching his brow. If not for the crowd, Guanyu would’ve pummeled him senseless. But with onlookers likely recording, restraint was wiser. He’d wait for the police.

As expected, the officers delayed their arrival—typical when dealing with brawls involving influential figures.

Pan Taisheng’s booming voice cut through the chaos as he pushed through the crowd. The scene at his apartment gate—Old Sun and his son battered, Wang groveling—left him livid.

“Old Sun! Who did this?!” Pan roared, startling Wang. The coward shrank under his glare.

The swollen-faced boy mumbled, “Big Brother…help my dad…”

Pan gently cradled the child’s face, fury mounting. “Who the hell did this?!”

Guanyu explained the assault. Pan’s rage exploded. “You dare attack people at *my* doorstep? I’ll break your damn leg!”

Guanyu restrained him. “Not now. Trust me to handle it properly.”

Pan hesitated but yielded. Sirens wailed as an ambulance arrived. Guanyu pressed money into Old Sun’s hand for medical bills, insisting Pan accompany them.

The crowd dispersed, boredom replacing morbid curiosity. Ling’er frowned. “Shouldn’t we teach him a lesson?”

“Patience,” Guanyu said. “The police will come.”

Relieved, Wang schemed. Once officers arrived—his “allies”—he’d spin lies to jail Guanyu and claim Ling’er. But Guanyu anticipated this.

Wang sneered. “Beg me, and I’ll let your pretty friend go. Otherwise, enjoy prison!”

Guanyu laughed. “You’ll be the one jailed. Assaulting a child and elder? That’s five years.”

Wang scoffed. “My uncle bought this job! You’re nothing!”

“We’ll see.” Guanyu’s voice turned icy. “I’ll strip your position and send you to rot. As for Ling’er?” He stepped closer. “Touch her, and your ‘jewels’ won’t survive.”

Wang paled. The officers arrived—time to test whose influence ran deeper.
