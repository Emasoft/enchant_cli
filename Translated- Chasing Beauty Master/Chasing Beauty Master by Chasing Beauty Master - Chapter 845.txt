Pan Taisheng scratched his head perplexedly and asked again, “Ling’er, aren’t you feeling unwell?” This time, Qing Ling’er heard him clearly. She smiled and replied, “Ah, no, I’m perfectly fine. Thank you for your concern, Brother Pan. If there’s nothing else, I’ll head back first.”

With that, she turned and left. Qing Ling’er had no desire to chat further, eager only to return home and shut herself away. She walked briskly, almost breaking into a jog. Upon reaching her house, she slammed the door shut, grabbed the large stuffed dog beside her, hugged it to her chest, and sat on the sofa. Her gaze fixed blankly ahead, lost in thought.

Guan Yu and Yang Conghan had finally finished their passionate encounter. Yang Conghan lay sprawled over the office desk, panting heavily as if she’d labored physically all day, her body drenched in sweat and utterly drained. Guan Yu leaned nearby, equally breathless. After a long while, Yang Conghan regained some strength. She stood, straightened her clothes, and helped Guan Yu adjust his attire before asking softly, “Do you like a woman like me?”

“I do. I like you exactly as you are,” Guan Yu answered tenderly. Their bond deepened instantly. After freshening up, Yang Conghan nestled against Guan Yu’s arm like a kitten. The two left the office, heading downstairs for a drink.

As they descended, Hou Jinshun greeted them first. Patrons in the lobby stared hungrily at Yang Conghan, their scorching gazes fixated on her sky-blue miniskirt as if trying to pierce through the fabric and glimpse what lay beneath.

The intense attention directed at Yang Conghan made Guan Yu seem almost invisible by comparison. Hou Jinshun asked, “Miss Yang, what would you and Guan Yu like to drink?”

Ever thoughtful, Guan Yu cheerfully replied, “Bring us a couple’s coffee.” The signature “Lovers’ Coffee” at Huaye Club was wildly popular—two heart-shaped cups filled with differently hued brews that revealed varying heart patterns as one drank. Delicious and visually enchanting, it was the quintessential choice for couples.

Hou Jinshun’s eyes sparkled with mischief as he noted their radiant faces. Even a fool could guess what they’d been up to. Recalling Qing Ling’er’s distraught departure earlier, he suppressed a chuckle and deliberately remarked, “Ah, such refined taste! Please wait a moment.”

Guan Yu and Yang Conghan chose a secluded table. Soon, Hou Jinshun arrived with a tray, personally serving their coffee. After setting down the cups, he casually asked Guan Yu, “Have you visited Ling’er recently?”

The question puzzled Guan Yu. “No? Has something happened to Ling’er?” he asked, worried the Qing family might be in trouble again.

Hou Jinshun feigned innocence. “Oh, no. She just seemed unwell when she left work earlier.”

Yang Conghan, who had just lifted her cup to sip, nearly choked upon hearing this.

“Cough! Cough!” She hacked violently. Guan Yu handed her a tissue. “Conghan, are you alright?” She shook her head between coughs, steadied herself, then turned to Hou Jinshun. “When did Ling’er leave?”

“Just half an hour ago. She bid me farewell and went home.” Hou Jinshun maintained a neutral expression, relishing Guan Yu’s discomfort.

Yang Conghan pressed, “But it’s so late! Why did she leave work now?”

“Miss Yang, you may have forgotten—today’s month-end. She stayed late to finalize accounts. Oddly, she finished unusually early this time. When she left, she seemed flustered, her face flushed and speech disjointed.”

Guan Yu merely sighed and took a sip of coffee, but Yang Conghan’s cheeks burned crimson—a shade Guan Yu had never witnessed before, akin to molten iron.

Mortified, Yang Conghan wished to vanish. She hung her head in silence as Hou Jinshun prodded further, “Miss Yang, you look rather flushed yourself, similar to Ling’er earlier. Are you unwell?”

When she remained mute, Guan Yu realized Hou Jinshun’s ploy. He chuckled wryly and gestured dismissively. “Enough. Get back to work.”

“As you wish. I’ll leave you two be.” Hou Jinshun retreated, grinning. Guan Yu sighed, then teased, “Seems our earlier… enthusiasm was quite audible. The offices only have a glass wall between them. Ling’er must’ve…”

He trailed off as Yang Conghan shot him a murderous glare, her face scarlet. She pointed a delicate finger at him. “You… you’re insufferable!”

**Chapter 2164: Quirky and Witty**

Guan Yu laughed. “No need for shame. The entire A City knows you’re my woman. What’s there to hide?”

“Quiet! You’re awful!” Yang Conghan’s embarrassment peaked. This was the most humiliating moment of her life. She even contemplated firing Qing Ling’er and Hou Jinshun to bury the secret.

“Alright, I’ll stop,” Guan Yu surrendered, clasping her slender hand—still savoring its recent ministrations.

Regaining composure, Yang Conghan declared, “I’m moving to Qiaoyuan District.” Guan Yu understood—his recent neglect had driven her to this. Whether due to her own longing or the Yang family’s scheming, he couldn’t refuse. As his woman, she deserved welcome, though integrating with the others might prove challenging.

“Of course. You can come with me tonight,” he agreed.

“No. I need to pack my belongings tomorrow. I prefer my own things,” she insisted.

“Naturally.” Guan Yu knew of her fastidiousness.

Her blush fading, Yang Conghan inquired, “Does Qiaoyuan District have private bathrooms?”

“Yes.”

“Rooms with fresh air?”

“Yes.”

“Reserve those for me. I won’t share spaces.”

“Done.”

Returning to Qiaoyuan District past midnight, Guan Yu checked Zhang Han’s room. Though the computer glowed, all women lay asleep on her custom-made oversized bed.

After showering, Guan Yu entered his dark room. A floral fragrance alerted him—reminiscent of Jin Hua’s sedative perfumes. But upon switching the light on, he found Lan Yu asleep in his spotlessly clean room, all items replaced. Her handiwork evident, he opted not to wake her, resigning to share the space.

**Chapter 2165: In Your Dreams**

The next morning, Yang Conghan arrived early with two trucks of belongings. The women gaped as Guan Yu explained, “I told you she’d move in. Luckily, there’s ample space.”

“Shameless! We built this mansion for your harem?” Xue Jing pouted.

Guan Yu stayed silent, knowing反驳 would unleash a storm. Yang Conghan’s aloofness contrasted with the others’ camaraderie, but as his woman, they tolerated her.

Yang’s staff unloaded her possessions, including her impeccably maintained car parked in the courtyard. Inside, Yang Conghan greeted everyone politely. Though distant, the women welcomed her warmly for Guan Yu’s sake.

Zhang Han, plump and bubbly, clung to Yang Conghan like a child reuniting with a mother. After Yang’s entourage left, Guan Yu faced the mountain of boxes. Knowing her aversion to others handling her things, he volunteered, “Pick your room. I’ll help arrange everything.”

“I’ll assist too!” Zhang Han chimed.

“Perfect,” Yang Conghan replied, beginning her selection. She’d long desired to live here, urged by her grandfather to strengthen ties with Guan Yu and monitor Zhang Han.

Lan Yu bounded over. “Sister Yang, take my room! It’s spacious. Then I can stay in Guan Yu’s room when I visit!”

The women groaned, rolling their eyes at her audacity.

Lü Mei retorted, “Even if we take turns, you’re youngest—last in line!”

Zhang Han added, “If Brother Guan flipped a roster, your name might never come up!”

“Ugh,” Guan Yu muttered inwardly.

Lan Yu jutted her chin. “Why shouldn’t I go first? Youngest gets priority!”

“Elders come first! Since when do juniors lead?” Lü Mei snapped.

As their squabble escalated, Guan Yu interjected, “Enough! We have a guest. Have some shame!”

Yang Conghan finally grasped Guan Yu’s daily trials—a chaotic yet enviable domesticity. She wondered if her reserved nature could adapt to such boldness.

“Enough arguing,” Yang Conghan declared. “Given my… standards, none of these rooms suffice. To maintain harmony, I’ll simply share Guan Yu’s room.”

Stunned silence fell.

Lü Mei exploded, “In your dreams! Guan Yu isn’t yours alone!”

Unfazed, Yang Conghan countered, “We’re all equals here. As the newcomer, you should accommodate me.”

The room erupted anew, leaving Guan Yu to lament his fate—surrounded by women whose rivalry knew no bounds.
