Guan Yu initially believed that the restriction on swordflight techniques at Tiger Head Peak was either a man-made rule or merely a gesture of respect, given that Tiger Head Peak served as Cloud Azure Sect's primary summit.

However, he later discovered it wasn't a prohibition against swordflight techniques alone. From the moment one stepped onto the Beamless Bridge onward, such techniques became utterly unusable—as if suppressed by some invisible force.

As for what exactly imposed this restriction, even Xuan Ming remained unclear, let alone junior disciples.

Shaking her head, Siqi said, "I don't know either. Once crossing the Beamless Bridge, swordflight becomes impossible. Even Master doesn't understand the source of this constraint. Long ago, I heard Master mention an ancient ferocious beast sealed beneath Tiger Head Peak. Its presence supposedly disrupts spiritual energy there, rendering swordflight ineffective. But whether this tale holds truth remains unverified after all these years."

Since even Elder Jiu couldn't confirm the legend's veracity, further speculation proved futile. Though Tiger Head Peak restricted swordflight, it didn't hinder cultivators' qinggong techniques.

Perhaps only spiritual energy was suppressed, not internal qi. Currently in recovery, Guan Yu would regain his status as a First-Class Honorary expert once healed. Combined with his spiritual energy, he would undoubtedly stand among Cloud Azure Sect's elite—likely surpassing even Chief Lu in combat prowess.

Clutching tightly to Siqi's embrace as if fearing a fall, Guan Yu breathed in her delicate fragrance. Too embarrassed to push him away, Siqi redirected her attention to avoid wandering thoughts.

"Guan Yu," she asked, "why does Master show such concern for your friend? Could she have taken a liking to him?"

Nodding, Guan Yu replied, "Your master has indeed developed fondness for my friend—a rather intense affection at that."

"Truly?" Siqi widened her beautiful eyes. "Is your friend married? I think they'd make a splendid match!"

"He has no spouse nor prior marriages," Guan Yu chuckled. "But his temperament proves... challenging. In this world, he heeds only two people. I fear your master might struggle to manage him."

"One being you? Who's the other?"

"His younger sister. She remains his sole family. To protect her from hardship, he's avoided marriage entirely."

"How noble!" Siqi gazed at Guan Yu running below, suddenly wishing for such a protective elder brother herself.

"Even if temperamental," she mused, "perhaps he'd change for Master if reciprocating her feelings."

"That pairing remains impossible. Besides, what man would fancy someone like your master?"

"Don't speak of Master that way!" Siqi protested. "How can you gossip behind her back?"

"I state facts. Chief Dai's intentions toward my friend are common knowledge throughout Cloud Azure Sect—only you remain oblivious."

Siqi stared in dawning comprehension. "I see... Does Master intend to recruit your friend as her guardian? Am I correct?"

"Congratulations on solving the puzzle," Guan Yu sighed. Usually sharp-witted, Siqi became remarkably dense regarding matters of the heart.

Upon reaching Convergence Peak, Chief Dai personally greeted them. "Ah, Brother Jici! I've awaited your arrival. Come! Fine wine awaits within."

**Chapter 3,339: Heart-to-Heart**

"Gratitude for your hospitality, Chief Dai." Jici Lang swaggered inside. "The wine shall be mine. Guan Yu here lacks the fortune to drink in his condition."

After dining, Guan Yu declared, "Thank you for the feast, Chief Dai. I must retire to rest."

"Since you oversee Guan Yu's care, Siqi," Chief Dai instructed, "escort him to his quarters. Little Lian will show the way. I'll keep Jici Lang company here."

Mouth glistening with grease, Jici Lang remarked, "What waste—this lavish spread barely touched! These dishes suit my palate perfectly." The centerpiece roasted lamb particularly delighted him—a perfect companion for heavy drinking.

Between bites, Jici Lang praised, "Whose hand prepared this lamb? Exquisite craftsmanship."

"Enjoy it?" Chief Dai smiled. "Should you favor this dish, I'll have it prepared regularly." In truth, she'd commissioned the lamb from Qian Hui Peak's master chefs—her own kitchen incapable of such delicacies.

Returned to his chambers, Guan Yu bid Siqi goodnight. As he prepared to sleep, knocking interrupted. Little Lian entered with a smile.

"Little Lian? What brings you here?" Guan Yu wondered if she came seeking artifacts. Though possessing the unused Furnace of Heaven, he hesitated to part with such treasure.

Physical attraction proved fickle—he'd gifted Siqi a jade ruyi without hesitation, yet balked at offering Little Lian comparable treasures. While pleasant-looking, Little Lian paled beside Siqi's fair complexion and charm.

"Knowing you'd arrived," Little Lian said, "I came to check your needs. Unwelcome? I'll depart."

Reading Guan Yu's impatience, she made to leave. "Stay," he quickly amended, mindful of hospitality. "Surely you seek more than courtesy?"

"Must you complicate matters? I don't crave artifacts yet. This room stood vacant long—I came to check bedding. Need extra quilts?" Leaning closer, she whispered, "If cold, I could warm your bed... should you wish."

"Sweating already, I require no additional heat," Guan Yu deflected. Her proximity raised temperatures despite his strong willpower—prolonged abstinence and intimate quarters testing his resolve.

"Scoundrel!" Little Lian laughed, retreating. "Merely concerned for your comfort! I'll take my leave."

Relieved, Guan Yu added, "Fear not—I'll honor my artifact promise. But as neither Siqi nor I received gifts from the Sect Master, you must wait."

"No hurry," she smiled. "My room lies nearby—summon me for any need."

"How fares Shi Zhen? Recovered?"

"Awoke three days past. Master reprimanded her severely and swore us to secrecy."

Guan Yu nodded—a female disciple sneaking into men's quarters using bewitching incense would spark scandal. "Glad she mends. I regretted striking so harshly."

"Fault lies not with you," Little Lian said. "Though your blow carried... considerable force. Sister Shi still suffers aftereffects—unable to lie down, sleeping seated to avoid headaches."

"Persistent symptoms?" Guan Yu mused. "Likely cranial blood clots pressing nerves when reclining. Has no one treated this?"

Little Lian shook her head. "Even Master lacks solutions. Recovery depends on time."

"Urban physicians might resolve this," Guan Yu noted, "but without proper tools here..."

"Guan Yu understands medicine?" Little Lian marveled. "Can you advise treatment?"

"Chief Dai could purge the clots through energy manipulation—if willing to expend spiritual power. Else, natural recovery remains the path."

"Why discuss Sister Shi?" Little Lian pouted. "I came to see you!"

"What else merits discussion?" Guan Yu feigned exhaustion. "This journey wearies me..."

"Fear not—I shan't devour you!" Laughing, she departed. Gratefully, Guan Yu settled to rest—until fresh knocking interrupted.

"Who's there?"

A delicate voice answered: "Me." Recognizing Xiao Tong, Guan Yu groaned inwardly—these Convergence Peak disciples seemed starved for male company.

"Unlocked. Enter."

Xiao Tong sat bedside as Guan Yu remained recumbent. "Heard you sustained grave injuries during back mountain training. Recovering well?"

"Sturdy constitution hastens healing. Thank you."

"Your spirit seems strong, but pallor concerns me. Still bedridden?"

"Three days' coma weakened my limbs. Mobility returns slowly."

After awkward silence, Guan Yu pretended fatigue: "The journey from Tiger Head Peak exhausts me..."

"I... have a request," Xiao Tong blurted. "You owe me a favor—remember?"

"Lifetime indebted," Guan Yu acknowledged warily. "Name your need."

"I wish to accompany your four elite disciples on their upcoming mission."

Guan Yu stared. "We investigate demonic cults—not sightseeing! Perilous work!"

"I crave adventure! Could you petition for my inclusion?"

"This proves complicated," Guan Yu hedged. "Requiring both Chief Dai and Sect Master Xuan Ming's approval..."

"So no guarantee?"
