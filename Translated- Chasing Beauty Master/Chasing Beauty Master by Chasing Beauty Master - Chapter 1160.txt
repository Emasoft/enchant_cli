When Hou Jinshun saw Yang Conghan (Jade Cold), he hurried forward and said, "Miss Yang, I should explain today's incident."

"Spare your words. I already know the gist. This isn't your fault—Guanyu caused this trouble." Yang Conghan spoke coldly, her tone perpetually frosty as ever.

As Yang Conghan approached Guanyu, Xue Jing greeted first, "Sister Conghan! This truly wasn't Guanyu's doing. Bierlin sent people to sabotage everything. They're responsible for this mess."

The Feng family's bodyguards had reduced the club's interior to ruins during their sweep, leaving no corner intact.

Yang Conghan countered, "Don't defend him, Xue Jing. Had he not brought his enemies here today, none of this would have happened. Am I wrong?" Her final question pierced Guanyu like an icicle.

Guanyu nodded. "You're right. I didn't anticipate Bierlin mobilizing so many men. I'll compensate for all damages."

"Compensate? With money? How laughable. Do I look destitute to you?" Her derisive chuckle chilled the air.

"Then what do you propose?" Guanyu sighed, knowing the Yang family's wealth dwarfed his own. Yet this club was Yang Conghan's personal venture—her grandfather never interfered, its profits and losses solely hers.

"It's not about my demands, but your solution. How will you make amends?" Her voice wavered imperceptibly, carrying an ache that tightened chests.

Second-to-Wolf glanced at Yang Conghan before whispering to Guanyu, "Brother, that ice queen's seething at you. What did you do? How could you neglect such a peerless beauty? Are you brain-damaged?"

"Says the walking neurological disaster!" Guanyu retorted. "I've been tied up dealing with your Sakurako. When would I have time—"

"Damn you! Blaming Sakurako now? Mangy dog!" Second-to-Wolf hissed. Their hushed argument continued, Yang Conghan too distant to hear but close enough to see Second-to-Wolf's lewd smirks.

Abandoning the quarrel, Guanyu descended the staircase. "I just took twenty million from Bierlin. Your club needs complete renovation and will lose revenue during closure. Will ten million suffice?"

"No." Yang Conghan's glacial stare intensified. "Ten million's inadequate. I want all twenty."

Second-to-Wolf's eyes bulged. The Yang heiress' greed astonished him—Guanyu offering ten was already generous, considering he'd haggled endlessly over two thousand earlier.

**Chapter 29972: Great Minds Think Alike**

Guanyu met her gaze helplessly. "My funds can't rival yours. Can't you be lenient? My men need provisions—hundreds depend on me."

"Not a penny less. Pay now, then leave." Her words crystallized the air. "And since you're so wealthy, I'll charge interest for future neglect. Avoid me, and I'll hound you daily."

Her frigid demeanor contrasted sharply with past interactions. Previously, only her grandfather and Guanyu received warmer tones.

Guanyu puzzled over what offense he'd committed—perhaps neglecting her since the Pan Taisheng apartment incident. He'd promised to meet at her villa but never appeared. No wonder resentment festered.

Relenting, Guanyu offered the check. "My fault entirely. Take this as recompense."

Xue Jing tugged his sleeve urgently. Before he could react, Yang Conghan's frostbite glare deepened. "Are you truly this obtuse, Guanyu? Do you honestly believe I want your money?"

As Guanyu began responding, Xue Jing interrupted, "Must you provoke her further?" She seized Yang Conghan's hand. "Sister, ignore him. He's emotionally stunted."

The truth glared obvious—Yang Conghan's monetary demands were mere pretext. Her true grievance lay in Guanyu's prolonged absence. Publicly acknowledged as his girlfriend yet perpetually overlooked, the media-scrutinized heiress craved attention any woman would.

Guanyu's transactional approach wounded deeply. For a woman of her stature, his "compensation" insulted more than financial neglect. That she didn't storm out immediately testified to remarkable restraint.

**Chapter 29973: Better Off With a Dog**

Xue Jing glared at Guanyu. "Apologize. Now."

Baffled but compliant, Guanyu muttered, "My apologies. Keep the twenty million. If insufficient—"

Xue Jing slapped the check from his hand. "Idiot! Does she need your charity?"

"But she demanded—"

"Get out!" Xue Jing shoved him aside before comforting Yang Conghan. "He's clueless. You know he's hopeless with romance. Every woman at Qiaoyuan District pursued him—he didn't court a single one. Emotional imbecile."

Yang Conghan's anger thawed slightly. She understood—yet understanding couldn't quell the ache. What began as joyful longing had curdled into resentful obligation. Their relationship, once society's golden couple, now hung by threadbare pride.

As Yang's sole heir, she couldn't abandon family duties to chase domesticity. Yet each business triumph rang hollow without Guanyu's presence. Potential suitors? "Better a loyal hound than such snakes," she often mused.

Guanyu watched from the balcony as Second-to-Wolf and Hou Jinshun departed for Ma Tong's casino. The ruined club echoed with unspoken tensions—a queen of ice, a mediator of fire, and a king oblivious to his crumbling realm.

Xue Jing's voice softened. "He's worth it, Sister. However exasperating...there's no other Guanyu."

Yang Conghan's fingers tightened around the discarded check. Slowly, deliberately, she tore the paper to glittering shreds. Let accounts be settled in currencies beyond bankers' comprehension.
