“Of course, Guan Yu did not recognize these blades, but Prince Zou certainly did. Prince Zou said, ‘It seems you have long awaited my walking into this trap. To dispatch so many Imperial Guards at once—the Second Prince truly holds me in high regard.’”

“‘Imperial Guards?’ Guan Yu emphasized the words. This Second Prince had indeed gone to great lengths. After the Imperial Secret Service suffered heavy losses, he now deployed the Imperial Guards.”

“Moreover, they had lain in ambush within the City Lord’s residence without Guan Yu detecting them. This was perilous indeed.”

“However, Guan Yu now grew concerned. The men outside were no ordinary incompetent soldiers of the City Lord’s forces. These were elites rigorously trained and selected. With just him and Wang Xiaorong present, protecting Prince Zou’s safety seemed unlikely. A plan was urgently needed.”

“In the main hall stood six individuals: Guan Yu, Wang Xiaorong, Prince Zou, Minister Zhang, and two maidservants standing nearby.”

“Wang Xiaorong suggested, ‘What should we do now? I think we should capture that scoundrel Minister Zhang first, then force them to clear a path for our escape.’”

“‘Useless,’ Guan Yu replied. ‘Minister Zhang is but a disposable pawn before the Second Prince. Even if we kill him, these men won’t yield. He lacks the value to serve as a hostage.’”

“A figure emerged from the Imperial Guards, his face concealed by black cloth—perhaps out of shame. Pointing at Prince Zou, the man declared, ‘Surrender yourself, and the others may live.’”

“‘Ridiculous! Utterly laughable!’ Guan Yu sneered. ‘You think a few squad leaders and these dog-like Imperial Guards can challenge the heavens? Have you no decency? Is this how you address a prince?’”

“‘To rebel against your superiors—do not let me discover your identity, lest I petition the Emperor to exterminate your nine clans! For Imperial Guards to act as another’s lackeys—preposterous!’ Prince Zou added coldly.”

“Meanwhile, Zou Wuhui located Xiao Zhi and Wang Jun upon hearing the commotion, arriving with all their forces. Wang Jun exclaimed in astonishment, ‘Heavens! When did so many infiltrate the City Lord’s residence? Who are these people?’”

“‘Imperial Guards—all the Second Prince’s men,’ Zou Wuhui stated calmly. ‘The Prince must be inside. We don’t know the situation yet.’”

“Xiao Zhi reasoned, ‘They should be safe for now. Guan Yu is likely with them. These guards are merely blocking the entrance—the interior remains secure for the moment.’”

“‘Why wait? Let’s charge in!’ Hong Ren urged impatiently.”

“‘We cannot act rashly yet,’ Zou Wuhui cautioned. ‘Without knowing the situation inside, reckless action might increase the danger for them.’”

“With only thirty men against over a hundred Imperial Guards, engagement would be unwise. As they deliberated, an Imperial Guard shouted, ‘We’ve brought explosives! Make any move, and we’ll blast those inside to pieces!’”

“The hall was surrounded three layers deep. Suddenly, men poured barrels of pine oil across the floor, drenching the chamber. A squad leader raised a torch, threatening, ‘Surrender or be burned alive!’”

“‘Wait! I’m here too! You can’t do this!’ Minister Zhang scrambled toward the exit but slipped on the oily floor, breaking his nose. Guan Yu shattered a plate against Zhang’s arm, snapping the bone.”

“‘Trying to flee? You’ll die with us,’ Guan Yu coldly declared as Zhang writhed in pain amidst the oil—prime kindling should flames erupt.”

“‘I only followed the Second Prince’s orders!’ Zhang pleaded. ‘We have no quarrel! Spare me!’”

“‘You served him faithfully, yet see how he repays you,’ Guan Yu retorted. ‘They intend to burn you alongside us.’”

“As Zhang futilely threatened the guards outside, an arrow suddenly pierced his skull, silencing him permanently. The maidservants screamed until Guan Yu urged them to flee—they stumbled out terrified but unharmed.”

“Guan Yu maneuvered toward a window with Prince Zou and Wang Xiaorong, prepared to escape the impending inferno. Outside, Zou Wuhui’s group disguised themselves as Imperial Guards, creating a diversion about royal envoys arriving.”

“Seizing the momentary confusion, Guan Yu smashed through the window with Prince Zou as flames engulfed the hall. ‘You’ll regret crossing Prince Zou!’ he roared while Imperial Guards panicked, realizing their scheme might reach the Emperor’s ears.”

“As the blaze erupted, the squad leader hurled his torch, igniting the oil. Guan Yu’s group barely escaped the exploding flames, fighting through the chaotic siege toward potential freedom.”
