Ling Su lay in his room, utterly unable to sleep. Though acutely aware of an alluring presence awaiting him outside, he dared not approach – that damned yellow python coiled around Xiao Mei's bedchamber made any attempt suicidal. The memory of those gleaming serpentine eyes still chilled his blood.

Beneath the wooden watchtower, the ancient well's roaring currents echoed through the night. Ling Su recalled Ma Zhagen's explanation from earlier – this centuries-old well had determined the Ha Clan's settlement. By day, clansmen drew water until the level dropped to a marked stone. Miraculously, every dawn revealed the waters restored to their original height, as if some underground spirit replenished the depths.

Most wells followed predictable rhythms, their levels rising and falling with subterranean streams. But this sentient-seeming well defied nature – no daytime seepage, only nocturnal resurgence. Ling Su peered into the ink-black abyss, the splash of unseen waters taunting him. The well rope's excessive length hinted at unimaginable depths.

Dawn found him haggard, jolted awake by nightmares of serpentine coils crushing his bones. The python's spectral presence seemed to linger in his pores. Bitter resentment festered – that Xiao Mei and her scaled guardian would pay for this humiliation. Yet prudence stayed his tongue; exposing her secret might jeopardize his own mission to uncover the clan's legendary martial arts manual.

As preparations for the expedition against the Heterodox Sect commenced, Ling Su noted Xiao Mei's conspicuous absence. Old Clan Chief's explanation – "She left to clear her mind" – rang hollow. Likely fleeing before her secret could be exposed. Let the snake-witch run, he decided. Greater prey awaited.

The war party numbered twenty-one, including Ling Su astride a groaning camel. Ha Dahei's tactical briefing echoed in the morning chill: "Bruce Tribe's been ravaged by Heterodox scum. We crush them by nightfall." Their hulking frames moved with unexpected grace across dunes, specially-widened sand-shoes distributing their massive weight.

Two days' journey southwest brought them to Bruce Tribe's ravaged outskirts. Charred yurts and wailing women testified to recent atrocities. Before formal greetings could be exchanged, battle cries erupted – black-robed sectarians with crimson sashes came swarming like locusts.

Ha Dahei's warhammer sent the first attacker flying, ribcage shattered. "Protect Ling Su!" he roared as two mountainous clansmen flanked the cultivator. Through the melee, Ling Su spotted the real prize – a gaunt sect mage weaving dark incantations. His fingers twitched, yearning to seize those forbidden scrolls...

Meanwhile, miles east, Guan Yu's group faced hostile reception at Bruce Tribe's gates. Mistaken for Heterodox raiders, they retreated as dusk fell. "We'll observe from afar," Guan Yu decided, unaware that Ling Su's war party now stormed through the tribe's heart.

Back at the well, moonlit waters began their nightly ascent. Deep below, scales rasped against stone as something ancient stirred.
