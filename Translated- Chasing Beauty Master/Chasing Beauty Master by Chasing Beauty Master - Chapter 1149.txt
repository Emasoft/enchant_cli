“Poison Widow heard Wen Lanqi’s words, swiftly stepped forward to snatch the phone, and declared, ‘Boss Ma, I’m here to help you find a solution. Don’t overthink this. Young Master Bill has already decided to use money to rescue your men.’

Upon hearing they were willing to pay a ransom, Ma Tong’s anger instantly dissipated. He chuckled, ‘Ah, Young Master Bill is truly generous! I thought tonight’s trivial matter would go smoothly, but who could’ve imagined those bastards had guns? That’s how they captured my useless subordinates. They’re demanding five million as ransom. What do you think…’

‘You’re right,’ Poison Widow cut in coldly. ‘Your men are utterly incompetent, failing even this simple task. Though Young Master Bill is furious, since this failure affects our partnership, he can’t abandon you entirely. But he won’t shoulder full responsibility either—after all, weren’t you negligent too, Boss Ma?’

Ma Tong grew confused by her shifting stance. ‘Enough circling! What’s your solution?’

‘To avoid escalation, we pay the ransom.’

‘Five million isn’t small change! It’ll take me two days to gather that sum. We’ll need Young Master Bill’s help.’ Ma Tong feigned poverty.

Poison Widow knew better—just two days prior, Bill Lin had gifted Ma Tong twenty million as collaboration funds. ‘Young Master Bill authorized me to deliver one million. You handle the remaining four. When you accepted twenty million earlier, you didn’t complain about excess. Stop this charade. One million is his final offer. Take it or leave it.’

In truth, Bill Lin had provided two million, but Poison Widow pocketed half. Having served him long, she understood the necessity of skimming funds. If discarded like Sun Xugeying, her stolen reserves would be her lifeline.

Ma Tong protested, ‘Our agreement was clear—I’d provide manpower while avoiding direct conflict with Guan Yu. Now you abandon me when trouble arises? A mere one million out of five? You think me a fool?’

Unfazed, Poison Widow countered, ‘Petty cash means nothing compared to our grand plans. Young Master Bill promises you’ll recoup losses through future collaborations. But delay risks your men cracking under interrogation. If they expose you, we’re done.’

Realizing his vulnerability, Ma Tong relented. ‘Fine. Give the million to Manager Wen. I’ll handle the rest.’

Poison Widow smirked. ‘You misunderstand. Hand me four million instead. My team will retrieve your men—your people might blunder again.’

Grudgingly, Ma Tong agreed. After confirming the transfer, Manager Wen opened her briefcase to verify the cash.

**Chapter 2,940: Five Minutes**

In the bar, Ah Xiao endured brutal beatings from Jia Bo, whose fury over tonight’s botched operation found outlet in violence. When headlights flooded the entrance, Jia Bo holstered his gun—Yu Gang reinforcements had arrived.

Fifty men swarmed in, filling the dance floor. A promoted Xiangzhu asked, ‘Brother Jia, who dared do this?’

‘Poison Widow’s lackeys under Bill Lin,’ Jia Bo spat. ‘Thought they could bully the new manager? They trashed the club and my spa! That bastard over there’s their leader.’ He pointed to the bloodied Ah Xiao.

The Xiangzhu eyed the carnage. ‘You took them all down alone?’

‘The cowards froze at my gun. But others escaped after wrecking the spa.’

Knowing firearms were taboo, the Xiangzhu whispered, ‘We should inform the boss.’

‘No need. I demanded five million ransom. Once paid, we’ll present it to Guan Yu. He’ll forgive us then.’

As Ah Xiao’s phone rang, Jia Bo snatched it. ‘Five minutes to bring the money, or I start chopping fingers!’

‘Remain calm. I’ll arrive shortly,’ Poison Widow replied, receiving the transfer confirmation. To Wen Lanqi, she asked, ‘Where should I send your men after retrieval?’

‘To the hospital, obviously. We’ll cover medical fees.’

Nodding, Poison Widow crossed the street to the bar, flanked by six Dark Sun cultivators.

Surrounded by Yu Gang members, she entered. Jia Bo lounged at the bar. ‘I remember you—always trailing Bill Lin. Why keep provoking us when you always lose?’

**Chapter 2,941: Not a Cent Less**

Seeing Ah Xiao’s mangled form, even the battle-hardened Poison Widow flinched. ‘I’ve brought five million. Let my men go.’

‘Plans changed,’ Jia Bo sneered. ‘Your thugs wrecked my spa. Six million now—not a cent less.’

‘Bill Lin only gave five!’

‘Then get more! Guan Yu’s en route. Delay, and it becomes ten million.’

Poison Widow’s composure cracked. ‘You think your rabble can stop me?’

Jia Bo bluffed, ‘Try us. Our cultivators will crush you.’

Though Yu Gang had none present today, the threat worked. Poison Widow hesitated—Guan Yu’s approach loomed like a stormcloud. Her stolen million teetered on this gamble.
