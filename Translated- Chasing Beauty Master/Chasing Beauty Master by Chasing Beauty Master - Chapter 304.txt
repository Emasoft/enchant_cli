“I refuse!” Wen Ya said indifferently, walking past Guan Yu as she prepared to leave.

Chapter 769: The Hooligans of the Slums

Guan Yu once again blocked Wen Ya's path.

“I told you, I won’t participate in the dance rehearsal. Please move aside,” Wen Ya said angrily.

“Just because you won’t participate doesn’t mean you don’t want to, right?” Guan Yu smiled.

“Who do you think you are? I neither will nor want to. Move!” Wen Ya finally lost her temper and stormed off, only to have her wrist grabbed by Guan Yu.

“Heh, your intense reaction proves my guess right. Now we can continue our discussion,” Guan Yu said.

Wen Ya shook off his hand and said coldly, “Whatever you do is pointless!”

“Would curing your mother’s illness count as pointless?” Guan Yu murmured.

Wen Ya stiffened, her almond-shaped eyes widening in anger. “You investigated me too? I thought you were different from Zhan Shouwang, but it seems you’re both cut from the same cloth!”

With that, Wen Ya left furiously without looking back.

Guan Yu stood frozen, then chuckled wryly. “Seems I’ve been misunderstood as having ulterior motives too!”

He chased after her. Having finally found a breakthrough from Wen Ya and Zhan Shouwang’s earlier conversation to persuade her to join the rehearsal, he couldn’t let her escape now.

Through their conversation and his system’s assistance, Guan Yu finally understood why Wen Ya prioritized work over the centennial celebration rehearsals—her family’s burden. Her mother’s critical illness demanded urgent funds, forcing Wen Ya to sacrifice time for multiple jobs.

Having identified the crux, Guan Yu’s solution became clear. Healing was his specialty. Unless it was terminal, he could cure it.

Chasing after her, he found Wen Ya clutching her phone anxiously, rushing out of the building into the crowd. Frowning, Guan Yu called Lin Dong: “Xiao Lin, find someone’s address for me. I’ll text the details. Need it now.”

Half an hour later, Guan Yu arrived at Wen Ya’s home in a dilapidated slum—crumbling brick houses, reeking garbage piles, and thuggish youths loitering. One bald, tattooed hooligan blocked Guan Yu’s path with a steel pipe.

“First time here?” the thug sneered.

Guan Yu nodded.

“This area’s dangerous for rich folks like you. But I, Bald Qiang, can protect you—for a fee.”

“How much?” Guan Yu asked, flashing a wallet full of cash.

“Five thousand!” Bald Qiang demanded.

“Lead me to Wen Ya’s home first.”

At Wen Ya’s name, Bald Qiang’s demeanor shifted. “Get lost!”

A scuffle ensued. Guan Yu disarmed Bald Qiang, forcing him to lead the way.

Bald Qiang, realizing Guan Yu’s identity as the underworld legend, groveled: “Big Brother Guan! I didn’t know she was your woman! Forgive me!”

“Ensure her safety here,” Guan Yu ordered.

Arriving at a decrepit brick house, Bald Qiang knocked aggressively until Wen Ya’s father, Wen Songbai, answered. Wen Ya appeared, furious: “Bald Qiang! I have a boyfriend who’ll cripple you!”

Bald Qiang cowered, pointing at Guan Yu. “Miss Wen, I brought your boyfriend!”

Wen Songbai stared in confusion. Wen Ya flushed, denying: “He’s not my boyfriend!”

Guan宇 grinned. “Let’s reintroduce myself. I’m Guan Yu, here to cure your mother.”

Ignoring them, Wen雅 dragged her father inside. “Mom still refuses the hospital.”

“I’m here to treat her,” Guan宇 insisted.
