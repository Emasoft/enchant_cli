“It was only then that the other man finally reacted. Guan Yu had moved too swiftly; no one expected him to strike without warning.

When he turned to look at his companion, he found the young man’s face drenched in blood—streaming from his nostrils, mouth, and even ears.

Earlier, the two had conspired, believing the heavens had blessed them with these stunning girls. Emboldened, they’d sought to provoke Guan Yu, never imagining he’d knock one unconscious in an instant.

Trembling at the sight of his bloodied friend, the remaining man stammered, “This has nothing to do with me! I didn’t say anything!”

Qu Shuangshuang stared wide-eyed, both awed and unnerved by Guan Yu’s brutality. The crash of shattered items and piercing screams soon drew staff and patrons rushing over.

A middle-aged woman resembling a manager clacked forward on towering heels, demanding, “What happened?” Her shrill shriek followed as she spotted the motionless figure: “Call the police! Now!”

Panic gripped Qu Shuangshuang as the manager dialed emergency services. *What if they arrest Guan Yu?* she thought, clutching Xue Jing for comfort.

Guan Yu coolly addressed the manager: “Direct any complaints to me. I’ll be leaving now.” He flung a wad of cash—over five hundred yuan—onto the floor. “Check, please!” With that, he motioned Xue Jing and Qu Shuangshuang toward the exit, sensing the manager’s bias toward the troublemakers.

The manager blocked their path. “You think you can flee after assaulting someone? The police will handle this!”

Guan Yu smirked. “Why take their side? Are you his mistress?”

“How dare you!” she sputtered.

“If not, why defend them blindly?” Guan Yu’s smile chilled the air. “Ever consider *I* might be the victim?”

Qu Shuangshuang tugged his sleeve. “Let’s just pay them off and go! The police—”

“Stay with Xue Jing,” Guan Yu interrupted gently. “These fools need lessons in humility.”

Before anyone blinked, he vanished—reappearing to kick the remaining assailant airborne. The youth slammed into a marble table, flipping it with a crash.

Gasps filled the room. A spectator filming the scene cheered: “Epic!”

Xue Jing whispered assurances to the trembling Qu Shuangshuang, well aware Guan Yu’s restraint was mercy compared to his past self. The manager, now cowed, muttered about police incompetence while medics rushed in.

As paramedics stretchered the unconscious youth away, the manager snapped at gawking staff: “Back to work!” Her tirade dissolved when Guan Yu fixed her with a glacial stare.

The beaten man writhed on the floor, clutching his stomach. “Our boss will destroy you!” he croaked. “Hand over the girls or pay up—or die!”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Still itching for more?”

“Cease this!” The manager brandished imaginary authority. “Our cameras captured everything! You’ll rot in jail!”

“Ah, so you’re his woman after all?” Guan Yu taunted.

Scarlet-faced, she spat: “You’re the criminal here!”

“Am I?” He gestured at recording phones. “Let the footage decide.”

Sirens wailed outside—ambulances outpacing sluggish police. Medics shouldered past the manager, one snapping: “We save lives, not judge them!”

As they loaded the second casualty, Guan Yu flexed his fingers. “Pity the cops are late. I’ve still got an itch to scratch.”

The crowd parted instinctively. Xue Jing smirked. Qu Shuangshuang, though shaken, began to understand: this storm would break however Guan Yu willed it.
