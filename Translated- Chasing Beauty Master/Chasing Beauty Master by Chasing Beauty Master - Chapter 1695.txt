The bandit leader then continued, “And the rest of you, don’t think you’re off the hook! Hand over all your silver, quick and clean. Those who give more can leave now. Otherwise, stay here and wait for death!”

One man, truly fearing for his life, immediately emptied all his belongings—not just silver but also jewelry—and obediently handed them over.

Pleased by this first act of compliance, the bandit leader waved his hand and said, “Good lad. Since you’re so obedient, I’ll let you go. Take your goods and leave.”

Encouraged by this, several others followed suit, reluctantly surrendering their silver to save their lives.

A middle-aged man in his forties approached with a small pouch containing only a few scraps of silver.

“Go to hell!” roared the bandit leader, hurling the pouch at the man’s head. “You think I’m a beggar? Drag him out and chop off his limbs!”

Terrified by this display, the rest hastily handed over their most valuable possessions.

Members of the merchant convoy who offered silver were gradually released, while those who gave too little—including the old captain and his two daughters—were detained.

Wang Jun observed the two girls closely. Only now did he realize they were twins, and quite comely at that—no wonder the bandit leader had taken a liking to them.

“You lot—got a death wish?” the bandit leader snarled at those who had offered scant silver.

No one dared speak, heads bowed in silence. The bandit leader, unconvinced they’d surrendered everything, growled, “Want to end up like him?” He pointed to a man lying on the ground, missing a hand for offering too little.

Still met with silence, the bandit leader glanced at the sky. Deciding he’d wasted enough time, he brandished his broadsword and barked, “Strip! Now! Every last thread! Let’s see if you’re hiding silver!”

Those with nothing to hide began undressing despite the cold. “Sir, we’ve got nothing! I’ll show you!” one said, swiftly removing his clothes.

The twin girls turned away, cheeks burning with shame. Some stripped willingly; others hesitated.

“You! Why aren’t you moving?” the bandit leader snapped, slashing a man’s belt with his blade. A hidden pouch clattered to the ground.

“What’s this? Rocks?” The bandit leader scooped up the pouch, sneering. “Lying to me, eh?” He kicked the man to the ground.

After that, no one dared hide anything. All silver was surrendered, and the stripped men shivered in the cold.

Wang Jun mused that this bandit leader either suffered from obsession or desperation—leaving nothing of value behind, no matter how trivial. It was almost impressive.

He’d encountered bandits before, but none so thorough. The leader bundled the loot—hundreds of taels—into a cloth sack, grinning. “Alright, scram! Vanish before I change my mind!”

The remaining men grabbed their clothes and fled. Only the old captain and the abandoned cargo remained.

“Heh! Today’s haul isn’t bad,” the bandit leader chuckled, handing the sack to a subordinate. He then approached the twins, who still refused to look.

“Aww, still shy?” he mocked. “Once I take you home, I’ll let you see *everything*!” His men roared with laughter.

A lackey chimed in, “Boss, you’ve gotta make these beauties your bandit queens! What about the old man?”

“Leave him. Grab the goods and the girls—let’s move!”

“Please! They’re just children! Let them go!” the old captain begged before a bandit kicked him into a wagon. Weak but defiant, he whispered, “Release my daughters…”

“Release them? Since when do I take orders from you?” The bandit leader hoisted one girl into his arms as she screamed and struggled.

“Smells sweet, this one!” he jeered. “Men, retreat!”

Wang Jun seethed. Stealing silver was one thing, but abducting girls crossed the line. Yet confronting fifty bandits alone was suicide.

“Let them go!”

Just as Wang Jun hesitated, Guan Yu’s voice rang out. Relief washed over him. “Perfect timing!” he called, standing.

Guan Yu emerged from the shadows. “You took too long. Couldn’t ignore this filth kidnapping girls.”

Wang Jun hurried over. “Their leader took all the silver and those twins—the old man’s daughters.”

“I saw. Meant to stay out of it, but…” Guan Yu stepped forward, addressing the bandit leader. “A true bandit knows limits: steal silver, leave lives. Who taught you to raid *daughters*?”

The bandit leader gaped, then blustered, “You lecturing *me*? Get lost before I break your legs!”

Guan Yu smiled. “You’d need more than threats.”

Uneasy, the bandit leader glanced around. Only two foes, yet they stood unflinching. “Last chance—move!”

“Release the girls and leave,” Guan Yu countered, “or *I* won’t be gentle.”

“You mocking me?” The bandit leader drew his blade. “Men, chop this fool!”

As the bandits charged, Guan Yu’s soul-reaping saber flashed. A crescent of Qi sliced through the night, hurling the leader into a horse. He crumpled, chest caved, sword clattering.

Silence fell. The bandits stared, stunned. Their invincible boss lay twitching.

“Check the girls and the old man,” Guan Yu ordered. Wang Jun approached unchallenged—the bandits retreating like scolded dogs.

The lackey helping the leader recoiled as the man coughed blood. “B-Boss…?”

“Help me up…” the leader groaned, bones shattered. Guan Yu’s casual strike had nearly killed him.

Wang Jun assisted the twins and the old captain, who wept, “Thank you… Thank you for saving my girls.”

The twins, no older than fifteen, huddled together. Wang Jun noted the captain’s advanced age—how were they his daughters? A late blessing, perhaps.
