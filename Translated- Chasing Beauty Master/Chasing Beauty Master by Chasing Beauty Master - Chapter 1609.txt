“Even if we employ forces from the martial world, we haven't seen favorable results. Charging directly in like this would likely be unsafe.”

The Centurion pondered for a moment before waving his hand in command: "Archers ready! Loose arrows..."

Twenty bowmen unleashed another volley. The whistling sound of arrows filled the air, yet when the shafts pierced into the building, they sank like stones into the sea without eliciting any reaction.

The Centurion frowned suspiciously. Could their enemies have hidden themselves completely? Were they shooting at empty air? He gestured for the archers to cease fire.

After all, they shouldn't exhaust all their arrows. Reserves were needed for emergencies. At this moment, Guan Yu led his men out to collect the fallen arrows for reuse. Under his direction, each man took position with pre-set traps and bows at the ready, awaiting the enemy's advance.

"Archers withdraw! Send two squads to charge in—leave no survivors!" the Centurion commanded, impatient to waste no more time on a mere doorway. Better to storm in directly—their target was Prince Zou. Eliminating him would solve everything. Though this might cost many soldiers, hesitation was no longer an option.

Two squad leaders assembled nearly forty men at the entrance, poised to charge on command. Other Imperial Guards surrounded all exits of the inn under orders to kill anyone emerging. Yan Zhao, having suffered injuries from previous ambushes, dismounted warily and retreated to a safer distance.

"Charge!" The Centurion's blade flashed as he roared. The vanguard kicked open the door and rushed in—only to find emptiness. Then from the second floor came men holding ropes tied to roof beams with heavy stones. As the guards flooded in, the defenders released their ropes.

Chaos erupted as plummeting stones smashed skulls, shattered shoulders, and crushed feet. Though the first wave suffered heavily, the remaining guards pressed forward under their leaders' orders. Suddenly, third-floor defenders appeared with improvised bows, raining arrows that pinned the attackers down. A squad leader took an arrow to the left arm.

"Retreat! Retreat!" The Imperial Guards scrambled out in disarray, their numbers halved. The Centurion cursed through gritted teeth: "Damn it! They were better prepared than expected—even had archers!"

The wounded squad leader recognized the arrows as their own. "Sir, we fell into their trap. They'd prepared all along," he reported. From a third-floor window, a voice called: "Centurion! At this point, wise men would retreat. This terrain favors us—every man you send in will die here."

The battle-hardened Centurion sneered at the warning. "You think this is enough?" He raised his blade high. "All forces charge! They've only twenty men at most—leave none alive!"

Trained to obey without question, the guards stormed in through windows and doors until the inn overflowed with combatants. Outside, only the cautious Yan Zhao remained. Inside, Guan Yu's forces engaged in desperate melee.

"See their commander?" Guan Yu told Wang Xiaorong. "Aim for him. Waste no bolts on others."

Wang shook her head. "I can't identify him." Her crossbow trembled in uncertain hands.

"Retreat! We're outnumbered." Though inflicting heavier losses, Guan Yu knew their position untenable. His group slid down rear ropes to escape—yet many fell to pursuing blades.

"They're escaping through the back!" shouts echoed. Guards poured out in pursuit as their commander inspected twenty fresh corpses before the inn. None were Prince Zou or his retinue.

"Still he escaped!" The Centurion's knuckles cracked with fury. Thirty dead, forty wounded—a disastrous outcome. When a squad leader reported losing the trail south of town, the commander backhanded him to the ground. "Useless trash! Keep searching!"

With only thirty combat-ready men left, the Centurion knew his mission had failed. Meanwhile, Guan Yu's remnant eighteen hid in a border-town inn. "We must regroup," he advised Prince Zou. "The Imperial Guards will ambush our route. We need more elite recruits."

Prince Zou agreed but lamented the rural area's lack of mercenaries. When Zou Wuxiao limped in with tales of escape, the Prince coldly ordered him bound. "You betrayed us!"

"Never!" Wuxiao protested. "I fought ten guards after being caught in the privy!"

Zou Wuqing pressed her blade to his throat. "Explain your absence during the attack!"

"My life was given by the Prince! Why would I betray him?" As debates continued, Guan Yu observed coldly—the truth hung palpable in the air, awaiting final revelation.
