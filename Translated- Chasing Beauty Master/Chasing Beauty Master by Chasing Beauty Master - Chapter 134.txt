The young man curled his lips in a smirk and chuckled, jerking his chin at the two underlings behind him. As he swaggered outward, he quipped, “See that? Boss Luo isn’t the same Luo Cheng who used to drink with us on street corners! He’s a big shot now. Let’s show some respect, yeah?”

Watching the thugs leave, Guanyu furrowed his brow and tilted his head at Luo Cheng. “Old friends of yours?”

“Mhm… yes,” Luo Cheng admitted awkwardly, nodding.

Guanyu rubbed his temples but said nothing more. Yet he seemed to realize that despite Luo Cheng’s rising reputation in the underworld, some still saw him as the small-time gangster leading a dozen lackeys. The attitude of those men had betrayed that truth.

For now, Guanyu’s mind was elsewhere. Once they found Du Xiaojuan, Luo Cheng would need to make a grand move in N City’s underworld. Otherwise, no one would take him seriously.

As Guanyu pondered, his phone rang.

He glanced at the screen and bolted upright, answering swiftly. “Xiaojuan, where are you?”

The line was open, but only faint sobs answered him.

“Where are you? Do you know how worried I’ve been? Tell me—I’ll come get you. Didn’t you say you wanted me to take you home?”

Du Xiaojuan covered her mouth, tears cascading down her cheeks.

“I’m… at our little nest. Come home. I’ll… wait,” she choked out between sobs.

*Little nest?* Not the villa, but the rented storefront apartment where they’d first lived together. Guanyu’s heart leaped. He waved at Niu Le and Luo Cheng, striding urgently toward the exit.

During the drive, Guanyu kept talking, though Xiaojuan remained silent, listening quietly.

Only hours apart, yet her longing for him already felt like a knife twisting in her chest. She recalled his teasing grin, his protective intensity, the way he’d burrow into her embrace like a child. She’d intended to sit in their old haunt one last time before leaving N City forever. But here, every memory—from their first meeting to their life together—flooded back.

*I can’t leave him.* After hours of inner turmoil, she’d finally called through her tears.

Guanyu flung the car door open and rushed into the rented space. The second-floor light glowed. Seeing that warm window, his heart steadied at last.

He pushed the door open slowly. Luo Cheng and Niu Le stayed tactfully in the car, eyes closed, music playing.

Upstairs, Guanyu hurried to the bedroom. When he opened the door, his heart shattered.

There she sat—his poor, foolish girl—curled in the corner, knees hugged to her chest. Her tear-streaked face lifted palely, cheeks pressed to her knees. Swollen eyes, red as walnuts, gazed up at him with desolate confusion.

“It’s okay now… Come here.” At a loss for better comfort, Guanyu sat beside her, gently pulling her into his arms. “Let me hold you.”

**Chapter 328: The Storm Approaches**

Holding Du Xiaojuan’s delicate frame, Guanyu felt utterly helpless. For a moment, he resolved to distance himself from other women.

Yet thoughts of Liu Shilei’s unwavering devotion and Feng Xin’s fierce dependency tangled his heart into knots.

“Guanyu… will you abandon me?” Xiaojuan whispered against his shoulder.

He shook his head. “Never. If you stay by my side, I’ll keep you with me forever. My little shadow.”

“But… you and Wenqing…”

Guanyu swallowed. How to explain? A one-night stand? Then why invite her into their home? Trapped by his own contradictions, he stayed silent.

Seeing him clam up again at Wenqing’s mention, Xiaojuan’s tears resurged. “You’re horrible! You don’t care about my feelings. I gave you everything, and you… you betrayed me!”

“I did. So I’ll spend the rest of my days making it up—spoiling you, protecting you. Deal?” He murmured sweet nothings, willing to say anything to mend this.

“Empty words! How can I be happy when you’re with others?”

Guanyu’s silence returned.

Even Xiaojuan noticed the pattern now—he dodged every mention of Wenqing.

Through tears, she turned to him. “If I left, would you hurt? Would you miss me? Regret everything?”

Guanyu stiffened, locking eyes with her. “Don’t think about leaving. I won’t allow it.”

She covered her mouth, fists pounding his shoulders. “You brute! You’ve stopped caring… stopped loving me!”

“Who says?” He endured her blows. “When have I ever stopped?”

“Then why be with her? Why let her into our home? Do you… want us both?”

“…Yes.” The admission slipped out.

Xiaojuan froze mid-sob. “You…”

Guanyu shrugged. “I won’t wrong either of you. What’s done is done. Should I become a heartless villain? I can’t.” He fished out a cigarette.

“I know it’s absurd. But I don’t know how to fix this. I only know losing you would destroy me. I’ve grown used to having you here—every day, every moment. Promise you won’t leave.” His calm tone belied deep desperation that pierced Xiaojuan’s heart.

In her eyes, Guanyu had always been unshakable—a man no challenge could daunt. Yet this vulnerable confession shook her. She felt his love… so why Wenqing?

“This can’t work. Would Wenqing even agree?” She traced his jawline, maternal instincts surfacing at his fragility.

Guanyu sighed. “Can’t force it. She knew I had someone. If she can’t bear it, she’ll leave. Let those who can’t accept it walk away. For now… I just don’t want to lose you.”

“I won’t leave.” Her whisper sealed the truce.

Guanyu exhaled inwardly. *Crisis averted.*

After more coaxing, he led her downstairs, her small hand in his.

In the car, Xiaojuan leaned silently against him. Niu Le glanced back. “Senior, don’t be sad. Boss was frantic—hasn’t eaten since…”

“Drive,” Guanyu cut him off.

Back at the villa, tension crackled the air.

Feng Xin sat icy-faced on the couch beside bored Zhao Jinger and beaming Wenqing.

“Hubby! You’re back! I made dinner,” Wenqing chirped, rushing over.

Guanyu coughed, signaling Niu Le and Luo Cheng.

Sensing danger, Niu Le yanked Luo Cheng’s arm. “Let’s hit your clubs! Been ages!”

They fled.

**Chapter 329: I Won’t Leave You**

In the car, Niu Le patted his chest. “Boss is doomed! Sister Xin’s temper…”

Luo Cheng forced a grin. “May heaven help him. But… aren’t we deserting him?”

Niu Le shrugged. “Want to rescue him? You go.”

“No way!” Luo Cheng shook his head violently. “Sister Xin looks ready to eat people!”

…

Inside, Feng Xin stood, glaring. “Guanyu! Who is she?”

“I’m his woman,” Wenqing shot back. “What’s it to you? This isn’t your villa.”

“Shut your mouth before I rip it off!”

“Hubby! She’s threatening me!”

Ignoring them, Guanyu led Xiaojuan upstairs. “Jinger, get ready. I’ll treat you soon.”

In the bedroom, he dragged Wenqing’s luggage out.

“Hubby! What—”

“Pick another room. If you want chaos, I’ll move out myself.” His cold tone brooked no argument.

Xiaojuan sat listlessly on the bed.

“It’s alright,” he murmured, cupping her face.

Later, treating Zhao Jinger, Feng Xin stormed in.

“Explain yourself!”

Guanyu pulled her into her room and embraced her.

She stiffened, then slowly melted.

“Why bring her here?” she mumbled against his chest.

“I have to take responsibility… We slept together drunk. Please, Xin. I can’t lose you or Xiaojuan.”

Blushing, she peeked up. “I’m… not like Xiaojuan. She’s your girlfriend. What am I?”

He held her gaze.

Flustered, she relented. “Fine… I won’t leave.”
