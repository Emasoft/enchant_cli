“Pretty boy, you can leave, but this chick stays. I like to keep things clean and efficient, and my patience is wearing thin. Get lost fast if you know what’s good for you. The quicker you scram, the happier I’ll be.” The bald man blocked Guan Yu’s path with his arm.

Guan Yu froze. These two were clearly determined to cause trouble here. But if a fight broke out, his identity would be exposed. Ma Tong would then have the perfect excuse to accuse Guan Yu of personally causing trouble at his establishment.

**Chapter 2733: Can’t Wait Any Longer**

If things escalated, Ma Tong might ally with Bill Lin—a scenario Guan Yu desperately wanted to avoid.

“Gentlemen, this is a place for fun. Let’s take our issues outside. Don’t ruin everyone’s mood. A good dog doesn’t block the path—mind moving aside?” Guan Yu said coldly.

The man in the black tank top stared at Xue Jing with fiery eyes, his self-control crumbling. “Fuck you! I’m taking this chick right here, right now! My soul’s about to fly away—I can’t wait any longer!”

He reached out to shove Guan Yu, intending to push the seemingly frail “pretty boy” aside and grab the girl. But as his hand moved, Xue Jing threw a swift punch aimed at the same spot where her earlier kick had landed.

Assuming the man was all brawn and no skill, she expected her fist to connect with his face again. To her shock, he anticipated her move. His hand, originally meant to push Guan Yu, twisted mid-air and caught her delicate fist.

“Hahaha! Still want to hit me, little lady? Don’t worry—I’ll let you hit me all you want later. Let’s go!” The bald man laughed, yanking her wrist to pull her into his arms.

But he’d underestimated Xue Jing. The moment his grimy hand touched her, she seethed with humiliation. At close range, she drove her knee—clad in tight jeans—into his groin.

“Agh…!”

The man howled, releasing her wrist as he doubled over in pain. Xue Jing didn’t stop. Pivoting on her right foot, she launched another vicious kick at the same tender spot.

Two precise blows to the groin left him writhing on the floor, face ashen, clutching himself soundlessly.

The black tank top guy rushed to his friend’s side. “You okay? Damn, getting your jewels wrecked by a chick? Embarrassing!”

The scuffle drew a crowd of onlookers. The black tank top stood, jabbing a finger at Guan Yu. “Pretty boy, you know who we are? You’ll regret messing with us today!”

Though Xue Jing had done the fighting, their fury fixated on Guan Yu—an innocent target caught in the crossfire.

Secretly, the black tank top relished his friend’s downfall—one less rival for the girl. A spoiled star child with a famous actor father, he’d come to the new casino with four friends. Spotting Xue Jing by the staircase fishing game, they’d been instantly smitten.

Three more companions arrived. Feigning concern, the black tank top urged, “Get Baldie to the hospital—I’ll handle this.”

A pink-haired lackey bristled. “Who did this? Need backup?”

“No. Just go. I’ll make them pay.”

Once alone, the black tank top smirked at Xue Jing. “Hurt my friend? That’s assault. Come quietly, or I’ll have cops haul you to jail. I’ve got connections.”

Xue Jing ignored him. Guan Yu warned, “Back off, or you’ll end up like your friend.”

“You’re dead, pretty boy!” The man pulled out his phone. “Cops’ll be here soon!”

Ju Niu, Ma Tong’s enforcer, pushed through the crowd. “Who’s causing—?” He froze upon recognizing Guan Yu.

Guan Yu quipped, “Came to play games, but these flies bothered us. Squashed one; here’s the other.”

“They attacked first!” the black tank top shouted. “Cops’ll sort this!”

**Chapter 2734: Give Me Some Face**

A server whispered the truth to Ju Niu: the men had provoked the fight. Xue Jing grew uneasy under the gawking crowd’s gaze.

Ju Niu advised the black tank top, “Check on your friend.”

“I’m waiting for the cops!”

“Let me handle this. Go.” Ju Niu insisted, wanting to minimize casino disruption.

The star child leaned close. “Help me keep them here. I’ll make it worth your while.”

Ju Niu grimaced—antagonizing Guan Yu meant crossing Ma Tong. “Take it outside. Give me some face, yeah?”

“What if they run?”

“I know where they live. Your problem after that.”

Relenting, the black tank top sneered at Guan Yu, “Let’s settle this outside.”

Guan Yu smirked. “Why leave? I’ll wait for the cops here. Mosquitoes are bad tonight.” He resumed playing the fishing game, ignoring stares.

Xue Jing sighed but stayed silent. Ju Niu threatened, “Troublemakers aren’t welcome. Resolve this elsewhere.”

Guan Yu kept firing virtual harpoons. “My business stays here. Let Ma Tong come himself.”

**Chapter 2735: Proper Handling**

Ju Niu called Ma Tong, explaining the situation.

“So Guan Yu wasn’t targeting us?” Ma Tong mused. “Keep the peace. Don’t provoke him.”

Ju Niu approached Guan Yu. “Please—take this outside.”

The star child gloated inwardly, imagining Xue Jing alone after Guan Yu’s arrest. But Guan Yu kept playing, unfazed.

Two of Bill Lin’s men watched gleefully—the chaos served their purpose.

As Ju Niu pleaded, Guan Yu finally stood. “Tell Ma Tong his ‘proper handling’ needs work.” He strode out, Xue Jing following. The crowd dispersed, the casino’s neon lights flickering over the unresolved tension.
