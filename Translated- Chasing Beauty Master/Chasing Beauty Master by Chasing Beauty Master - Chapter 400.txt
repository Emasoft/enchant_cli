“This statement may seem exaggerated, but it isn’t. Take infrastructure projects—the profits in every nation are unimaginable to ordinary people. Once you secure such deals, wealth pours in like a flood. Combined with the sensitivity of resource control, the Song Family’s domestic influence could be described as reaching its zenith.

Now that he’s beaten a collateral member of the Song Family and humiliated their future heir, how could the Songs let this slide without retaliation?”

“Seems I’ve really stirred up a hornet’s nest!” Guan Yu muttered to himself.

Wen Baoguo snapped, “Took you long enough to realize?” If not for his daughter’s feelings, he’d have kicked Guan Yu out long ago! Such impulsiveness, acting without forethought—how could his daughter find happiness with someone like this?

“Enough shouting!” Old Master Wen barked irritably. “Didn’t you hear Xiaoyu explain? That Song Dawei tried to disgrace our Xiaoqing! Xiaoyu acted to defend her! I say, you brat—have you grown timid after years serving superiors? If someone insulted Yunshu like that, would you just smile and nod?”

Wen Baoguo froze, silenced. He’d been so preoccupied with fearing the Songs’ retaliation that he’d forgotten the incident originated from their provocation. Truthfully, if Yunshu faced such humiliation, he’d have reacted no differently than Guan Yu.

“What’s done is done,” interjected Old Master Liu. “Rather than assigning blame, we must focus on solutions. Baoguo, your years as a minister weren’t for nothing! Though retired, your father and I still hold some sway. Old connections will grant us face. However mighty the Songs are, they can’t monopolize the heavens! This crisis presents an opportunity—we’ll remind the capital our families haven’t faded!”

Moved, Guan Yu said, “Grandfathers, this trouble began with me. I’ll find a way to resolve it!”

Old Master Wen waved dismissively. “No need for words, Xiaoyu. We’re family—we won’t let anyone bully you!”

“Xiaoyu, I know your spine’s strong,” said Old Master Liu. “But you’re facing no ordinary clan. Even we must tread carefully against them. Still, if you’ve strength to show, do so! Let this old man witness your capabilities!” The challenge to prove himself was clear.

“Understood, Grandfather. Don’t worry.”

Guan Yu nodded. Though his influence in the capital paled against the Songs’, he’d ensure their “ferocious hound” learned this bone wouldn’t break easily—they’d lose two teeth with every bite!

...

To the public, Guan Yu’s clash with Song Dawei appeared mere street brawling. Yet among the capital’s elite, shockwaves spread. Observant families watched closely. Enemies like Li Bing of the Li Clan grinned ear-to-ear, swirling red wine in glee.

Noticing his glee, Liu Wenwen cooed, “Brother Bing, what pleases you so?”

“Haha, little minx, don’t you know? Guan Yu’s finished! That fool picked a fight with the Songs—his doom’s sealed!”

“The Song Family? Can they truly defeat him?” Unfamiliar with their might, Liu couldn’t share his excitement.

“Heh, their power dwarfs your imagination! No more questions. Did you wear that lingerie I bought?”

“Yes!” Slipping off her dress, she revealed a bodystocking accentuating voluptuous hips.

With a lewd chuckle, Li Bing pounced. Moans and growls soon filled the room.

...

Near the Forbidden City, Li Yu stood deferentially behind Young Master Li, barely containing joy. “You mean Guan Yu’s truly doomed?”

Initially skeptical of rumors about Guan Yu striking a Song, Li Yu now reveled in the news. Only decorum prevented him from celebrating openly.

Yet Young Master Li cautioned, “Uncertain. While Guan Yu seems to have kicked an iron plate, whether it shatters under his foot remains unseen. That foot now represents not just him...”

Li Yu paled, comprehending. Though Guan Yu’s personal power couldn’t rival the Songs, the Wen and Liu Families backed him. If the Songs pressed relentlessly, both clans would fight to mutual ruin. Moreover, the ambiguous stances of the Jiangs and another Li branch complicated matters.

*If only the Songs’ fury would burn fiercer!*

...

At the Jiang Estate:

“Father, should we aid Guan Yu?”

Jiang Ziqi had heard of the conflict. Though previously advised to befriend Guan Yu, such a decision risked the entire clan. Victory would elevate them above the Songs; defeat might spell their downfall.

“That boy certainly stirs trouble!” Unlike his son, Jiang Shang smiled, though restless finger-tapping betrayed inner turmoil.

Initially, he’d recognized Guan Yu’s exceptional aura—a dragon among men. Like discerning urbanites from rural folk, Guan Yu’s latent greatness was obvious to trained eyes. Yet Jiang never anticipated his first stepping stone would be the colossal Songs...

As Jiang Shang’s fingers drummed faster, Ziqi wrestled with conflicted motives—partly driven by the parasite Guan Yu implanted, partly by his father’s counsel. Without allies, his path promised thorns.

Finally, the drumming ceased...

...

All awaited the Songs’ wrath. Even Guan Yu anticipated their lethal strike, yet none came—at least, not before the gala.

“Darling, let’s go!” Oblivious to tensions, Wenqing shimmered in her gown, an ethereal vision that stole Guan Yu’s breath.

“Wife, I’m having regrets.”

Puzzled by his gloom, she asked, “Why?”

“You’re too radiant—others will leer! I hate sharing your beauty.”

Giggling at his childishness, she pecked his cheek. “Let them look! Their envy honors you.”

Still grudging, Guan Yu yielded as she tugged him out.

Outside, Lin Dong awaited. “I’ll join the ball.”

Knowing his protective intent, Guan Yu teased, “Need a date for that.”

Suddenly, Lin Lin skipped in. “Hi, Guan Yu!”

“Sister Linlin!” Surprised post-kidnapping reunion, Guan Yu gaped at her clutching Lin Dong’s arm. “You two?!”

“Shocked?” She grinned.

“Impressed! Only you could thaw this icicle.” Guan Yu laughed. “Lin Dong, you sly dog!”

Lin Dong deadpanned, “You should call me brother-in-law.”

Guan Yu choked before flipping him off. “Screw you!”

En route, Guan Yu whispered, “Protect Wenqing if I’m compromised.”

Fearless in combat, he dreaded official reprisals endangering her.

“Stay safe. Or I’ll unleash chaos.” A killer’s pledge to slaughter threats.

Moved, Guan Yu clasped his shoulder. “Brother.”

“Piss off!” Lin Dong recoiled, feigning disgust.

“Hey! Bros stick together!”

Ahead, Lin Lin warned, “Don’t steal my man, Guan Yu!”

...

**Chapter 1002: Attending the Ball**

The Guozijian Clubhouse near Anding Gate appeared modest—weathered red walls masking opulence known only to elites. Membership required no fees, only competitive contributions proving wealth and influence.

As Lin Lin explained, Guan Yu marveled. “Fools fight to donate millions just for a rotating presidency?”

“Exactly! Annual top contributor becomes chairman—powerful enough to expel members or invite new ones. Though none’s ever been expelled.”

“This year’s chairman?”

“Hu Family’s heir, Hu Zongze.” Unaware of Guan Yu’s feud with Hu, Lin Lin continued, “It’s all about networking. Membership here opens doors to power.”

**Chapter 1003: Guozijian Clubhouse**

Parked luxury cars flanked the entrance—Ferraris, Rolls-Royces, even humble Audis with elite plates.

“Well, if it isn’t Guan Yu! Brave of you to show.” Li Bing sneered, arm around Liu Wenwen.

Compared to Guan Yu’s regal poise and Lin Dong’s lethal elegance, Li’s gaudy attire screamed vulgarity. Wenqing’s beauty left him drooling.

Guan Yu’s eyes turned icy as he nearly lunged to cripple the lecher, but Lin Lin stopped him. “Brawl here, and you’re barred. Deal with trash later.”

“Lucky today,” Guan Yu growled. “Next time you eye my wife, I’ll neuter you!”

“Next time?” Li Bing jeered. “You’ll be lucky to leave intact—AHHH!”

Clutching his crotch, he shrieked like a speared boar.

“Brother Bing! What’s wrong?” Liu Wenwen fretted.

“My dick! It’s broken!”

Wenqing winced in sympathy. “What happened to him?”

Guan Yu smirked, leading her inside as chaos reigned.
