“Should we split up? That way, we’ll cover more ground,” Wang Jun suggested after a moment’s thought.

“No need,” Guan Yu replied. “Didn’t the teahouse folk say the earlier group headed west? Let’s follow that direction. We’ll leave markers along the way—it’ll make backtracking easier.”

Wang Jun shook his head silently. In ordinary terrain, leaving markers would be simple. But here, in this endless desert, even that basic task felt impossible. The shifting sands devoured all traces, rendering any attempt futile.

“It’s not that straightforward,” Wang Jun finally said. “How can we leave lasting markers here? Surviving without getting lost is challenge enough.”

Guan Yu gestured to the bundled fodder on their camels. “Even if traditional markers fail, we’ll improvise. Pluck a stalk and plant it in the sand. Unless a sandstorm hits, these should guide us.”

Each camel carried sparse provisions, including meager grass reserves. By anchoring a single blade upright, they might create temporary signposts—fragile but better than nothing.

The party trudged westward through the dunes until deep desert enveloped them. Barren expanses stretched endlessly, reducing human figures to insignificance against the golden vastness. Only tenacious weeds clung to life in scattered hollows.

“We’ve marched swiftly, yet there’s no trace of the Demon Soul Sect,” Wang Jin frowned. “Could we have misread the path?”

“Unlikely.” Guan Yu pointed to faint tracks. “See these sporadic camel prints? A sizable group passed this way recently.”

A’ze wiped sweat from his brow. “True, but the winds grow fiercer. This environment worsens by the hour.”

As daylight waned, water supplies dwindled and exhaustion set in. Guan Yu prepared to order camp when Wang Jun suddenly stiffened. “Look! What’s that ahead?”

Miles distant, a dark pillar loomed—a blurred silhouette against amber skies.

“Ruins, perhaps?” Guan Yu squinted. “Though why would structures exist here? Unless others camp there...”

Siqi approached, her scarf fluttering. “Deserts often conceal ancient relics. This might be remnants from greener eras.”

“Let’s investigate,” Guan Yu decided. “If enemies await, we fight. If allies, we join forces. Either way, shelter beats open dunes.”

The pillar defied approach. Despite hours’ march, the distance never shortened—a mocking illusion.

“It recedes as we advance!” Wang Jun exclaimed.

“Or it’s a mirage,” Siqi countered. “Deserts toy with perception. That ‘pillar’ could be leagues distant—or nonexistent.”

“A Fata Morgana?” Wang Jun muttered.

Guan Yu scanned darkening skies. “We camp here. Secure the camels and tents with ropes—sandstorms strike without warning.”

Following Siqi’s advice, they lashed everything together. As temperatures dropped, the group huddled in clustered tents, conserving warmth.

“Ration water strictly,” Guan Yu ordered. “Today’s consumption was reckless. From tomorrow, sip only when necessary.”

Ling Su smirked in the shadows, plotting unknown schemes as others nodded solemnly.

Beneath star-strewn heavens, Guan Yu lay awake, desert heat radiating through his bedroll. Siqi nestled close, her earlier boldness softened by fatigue.

“The North Star,” Guan Yu murmured, tracing constellations. “That brightest one—our compass. Follow it, and we’ll never lose north.”

Siqi’s finger joined his celestial map. “Like the Big Dipper back home?”

“Exactly. Though here...” His voice trailed into worry. Without progress, their supplies would vanish within days.

Midnight approached. Guan Yu abandoned sleep for meditative vigilance, senses stretching beyond flesh. A peculiar clarity emerged—his consciousness drifting like sand on wind, observing camp peripheries with preternatural acuity.

Chapter 4482: No Progress

Within the Emperor’s Seal artifact, Guan Yu’s projected spirit confronted its ethereal guardian—a smoke-formed entity.

“Master!” the wraith greeted. “Have you found the next Eight Drums technique?”

“Not yet,” Guan Yu admitted. “What of your studies on the first fragment?”

“No breakthroughs. The scroll’s secrets resist unraveling. More fragments are needed.”

Frustration simmered. Time dwindled, yet answers remained as elusive as desert mirages.

Chapter 4483: Unclear Circumstances

Reality snapped back as Siqi stirred. “Can’t sleep?”

Guan Yu’s senses prickled—not from romance, but looming peril. “Stay alert. Danger nears.”

Beyond their tent, the desert held its breath. Somewhere in the whispering dark, unseen threats coalesced.
