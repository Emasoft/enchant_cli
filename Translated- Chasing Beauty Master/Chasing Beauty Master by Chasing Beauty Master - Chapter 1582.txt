“Swordless Immortal has become a legend in the martial world,” Wang Xiaorong continued. “Over decades, countless challengers have faced him, yet none prevailed. They say he’s reached the realm where ‘absence surpasses presence’—no longer needing physical blades. With inner energy alone, he materializes swords in battle. For decades, no rival has matched him.”

“That formidable? Dominating the martial world for decades? Is he a dual cultivator of demonic and martial arts?” Guan Yu asked curiously.

“No. He reportedly uses no sorcery—only inner energy mastery. His cultivation has reached unparalleled heights none have ever touched.”

Guan Yu felt his blood stir. Such a figure! He yearned to meet this legend.

*If Swordless Immortal isn’t a dual cultivator, his sole weakness must be mortality. After decades atop the martial world, he’s surely an elderly man now—perhaps nearing death. How does he remain so powerful?*

Guan Yu pondered: *Could he be a peak Realm Sovereign here? If true, maybe he could help break the seal in my mind.*

Yet the ambient energy here felt ill-suited for inner energy cultivation. Reaching Realm Sovereign under these conditions would indeed be mythical.

“If Swordless Immortal isn’t a dual cultivator and relies solely on inner energy, he must be nearing his end,” Guan Yu remarked. “The title of ‘Number One’ will soon change hands.”

“Uncertain. His age remains unknown,” Wang Xiaorong replied. “Most challengers at Swordless Manor can’t even defeat the household guards. Many never glimpse Swordless Immortal himself—the attendants are already formidable.”

“Outrageous! Even the guards?” Guan Yu pressed. “With so many challengers, surely some have seen him. Is he truly a decrepit old man?”

“Why insist he’s elderly?”

“Obviously! Reaching such cultivation takes decades. Combined with his reign, he’d be over a century old—practically ancient. Probably half-dead already.”

Guan Yu grinned mischievously. Wang Xiaorong shot him a look. “Logical, yet speculative. The martial world knows neither his age nor appearance.”

“Impossible! With so many challengers, someone must’ve seen him. Exaggeration!”

“Not at all. First, few challengers return alive—Swordless Immortal shows no mercy. Most perish by his blade. Second, survivors never saw his face. He wears a mask unless defeated—and none have bested him in decades. Even his servants don’t know his true visage.”

“Eerie…” Guan Yu murmured, now intensely curious. *Even befriending such a figure would be extraordinary.* Yet Wang Xiaorong’s warning lingered—most challengers died. *A ruthless killer who finds pleasure in slaughter.*

True masters needn’t kill during sparring. Formal duels decided victories—excessive bloodshed hinted at derangement. *Swordless Immortal must be unhinged. Still… I must meet him.*

Prince Zou’s caravan pressed onward toward mountainous terrain. At noon, they paused to rest before ascending. Beyond these peaks lay the Swordless Inn.

“Xiaorong, drink.” Guan Yu handed her a waterskin. After she sipped, he asked, “What’s Swordless Inn’s relation to Swordless Manor?”

“Unrelated. Years ago, challengers gathered at the mountain’s base to prepare. Entrepreneurs built the inn to accommodate them. Some martial obsessives reside there for years, honing skills to defeat Swordless Immortal. The inn expanded repeatedly—now a thriving hub for aspirants seeking fame by toppling the legend.”

Guan Yu marveled. “The ‘Number One’ title’s influence is staggering. Even an inn becomes legendary!”

“Indeed. Swordless Inn enforces peace—no private brawls. Disputes are settled in designated arenas to avoid disturbing cultivators. That’s why Prince Zou chooses it—safety from assassins.”

Guan Yu nodded. Established rules deterred even Imperial Guards from causing trouble. With countless martial experts present, rule-breakers faced collective wrath.

“An ingenious sanctuary,” Guan Yu mused. “I’m eager to see it.”

“The inn houses reclusive masters—a den of dragons and tigers. None dare cause chaos,” Wang Xiaorong added. “Prince Zou likely plans to recruit more guards there with wealth.”

“His gold, his choice,” Guan Yu chuckled.

After resuming travel, Guan Yu grew vigilant. *Assassins might strike before we reach the inn.*

His caution proved warranted. Ahead, a ragged band blocked the path—Yan Zhao’s group. Still nursing an infected shoulder wound from Wang Xiaorong’s crossbow bolt, Yan Zhao lurked behind forty subordinates.

Yesterday’s treatment by the Left Envoy had barely stabilized him. Now, positioned on higher ground, he hoped terrain advantage and traps would compensate for his weakened state.

“Halt!” Guan Yu called, spotting disturbed earth ahead. *Trap.* “Are you bandits or assassins? If seeking riches, let’s negotiate.”

Yan Zhao cursed inwardly. *Don’t step forward!* His carefully dug pit—three meters wide, over a meter deep—lay just beyond Guan Yu’s horse.

“State your purpose!” Guan Yu demanded, eyeing the suspicious foliage.

From the rear, Yan Zhao trembled. Another bolt might finish him. *Let them advance into the trap!* But Guan Yu’s sharp eyes had detected the ambush.

Chapter 4104: Mountain Bandits

Prince Zou’s entourage numbered fifty—double the reported twenty. Yan Zhao’s forty ill-trained thugs seemed inadequate. Yet the slope favored them, and the trap awaited.

“We’re… mountain bandits!” a subordinate lied. “Leave your valuables!”

Guan Yu smirked. *Bandits? Unlikely.* But diplomacy first. “We carry royal tributes. Attack us, and the emperor’s wrath will scorch these mountains.”

The bluff gave pause. Guan Yu pressed, “Stand aside, and we’ll spare your lives.”

Yan Zhao hesitated. Failure meant disgrace in the Demon Soul Sect. Yet fighting might doom them all. As tensions mounted, a crow’s cry echoed—ominous and shrill.
