Not knowing how to explain his abrupt departure without even greeting them upon returning, Guan Yu recognized his impropriety yet chose silence.

“Alright, we’re teasing you,” Roxy said with a playful smile. “We know you’re on a mission. Once you’re done, you’ll make it up to us properly! Though really—what missions have you been running these days? Your clothes are practically rags!”

Startled by her remark, Guan Yu glanced down at his tattered attire and chuckled awkwardly. His gaze inadvertently met Shao Siming’s, and both quickly looked away, tension thickening the air.

Roxy gently tugged Shao Siming’s sleeve. “Hey, gorgeous, stop staring. Time to go.”

A blush crept across Shao Siming’s cheeks. Her lingering gaze hadn’t been admiration but astonishment—Guan Yu’s magical aura had intensified exponentially in mere days. *What could have caused such a drastic change?* she wondered.

“No problem,” Guan Yu replied, breaking the silence. “Once I finish urgent matters, I’ll take you all traveling. Show you the wider world.”

The declaration stunned not only Shao Siming and Roxy but even Amy beside him. Was this a promise?

Seeing their speechlessness, Guan Yu hastily added, “Of course, priorities first. Give me a week at most!”

“Then go finish your tasks,” Roxy said, pulling Shao Siming away. “Stay safe!”

As their figures receded, Guan Yu sighed. In under a month, he’d befriended so many remarkable women here. *What would my wives back home think of this?*

“Let’s count—one, two, three, four, five…”

“Dragon Clan brother, what are you counting?” Amy tilted her head.

Patting her hair, Guan Yu deflected, “Calculating how many hours till we arrive.” They exited the Elven Forest.

According to Elder Allen, traveling 300 kilometers east would lead them to their destination by nightfall.

“We’ll need to hurry, little one,” Guan Yu warned. “Or we’ll camp outdoors.”

Amy squared her shoulders. “Don’t worry! However fast you run, I’ll keep up!”

Her confidence reminded him—as an elf, she likely knew these woods better than he did.

“Then let’s run!” Guan Yu surged forward at full speed.

**Chapter 1289: Yongzhou City**

Enhanced by the Crystal Toad’s essence, Guan Yu’s physical capabilities had skyrocketed. He raced through terrain like a gale, Amy matching his pace effortlessly. After four hours’ sprint, a walled city emerged—Yongzhou, its imposing gates and watchtowers starkly contrasting Jinzhou’s lax security.

Halting 100 meters from the checkpoint, Guan Yu realized Amy’s elven ears posed a risk. Ripping cloth from his sleeve, he handed it to her.

“What’s this for?”

Before he could explain, a guard approached. Guan Yu swiftly wrapped the fabric around Amy’s head, concealing her pointed ears.

“Hey! What’re you—”

“Hush!” he whispered. “Elves are hunted here. Stay still.”

The guard brandished a gold-inlaid blade. “State your business!”

“We seek family in Yongzhou,” Guan Yu lied smoothly. “Would you grant passage?”

The guard rubbed thumb and forefinger together. “Convenience requires… motivation.”

Reaching into his torn pocket, Guan Yu paled—only one coin remained. The guard sneered at the offering. “Insulting! Even beggars here need more!”

With a flick of Metal Manipulation magic, Guan Yu recalled the coin. “Surely you’re worth more than beggars.”

The guard tensed at the display of magic but pressed on. “No coin? Leave the girl. I’ll pay *you* 100 gold.”

Guan Yu blocked his lecherous gaze. “Test my patience further, and I’ll find… alternative entry.”

Amy growled, “Humans are vile! Let’s fight through!”

“D-Dragon Clan?!” the guard stammered at her slip.

Seizing the advantage, Guan Yu nodded. “Indeed. Now, may we enter?”

Trembling, the guard bowed. “F-forgive my blindness, milord!”

**Chapter 1290: Golden Token Auction House**

The bustling streets surpassed Jinzhou’s vitality. Amy fidgeted with her headscarf. “Can I remove this now? It’s hideous.”

“Not until I say,” Guan Yu chided. “Endure it. You’ll be princess again in the Elven Forest.”

Following directions, they reached a colosseum-like structure by dusk—the Golden Token Auction House. A silver-armored guard blocked the entrance. “Invitation?”

“We don’t have one.”

“Then leave,” another guard sneered. “This isn’t for peasants.”

Guan Yu’s temper flared. “You deny patrons based on status?”

“Exactly. Our prestige thrives on exclusivity.”

As guards jeered, Guan Yu materialized behind one, hand at his throat. “Let us in, and no one gets hurt. We seek someone named Shituo.”

“Shituo?” The guards exchanged blank looks.

A sultry voice interrupted. “Who disturbs our threshold?”

The guards stiffened. “Madame Bai!”

The voluptuous Madame Bai assessed Guan Yu. “Explain this commotion.”

“This… gentleman demands entry without invitation, seeking Shituo.”

Her painted lips curved. “Shituo, you say? How… intriguing.”

**Chapter 1291: Bai Xuelan**

Madame Bai’s eyes glinted with calculation. “Why would a Dragon Clan member seek our elusive guest?”

Guan Yu met her gaze unflinching. “That’s between him and me.”

Her laughter tinkled like wind chimes. “Such fire! Very well—prove your worth in the arena tonight. Victory grants an audience.”

As she vanished in a perfume cloud, Amy tugged Guan Yu’s sleeve. “It’s a trap!”

“Maybe.” He grinned. “But what’s life without risks?”
