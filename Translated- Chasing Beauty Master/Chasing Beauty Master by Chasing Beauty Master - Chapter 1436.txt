“So, does that mean you agree to treat my friend?” Xiao Zhi asked cheerfully.

"Not so fast," the other replied. "I have no problem helping your friend, but you must do something for me first."

"No problem," Xiao Zhi agreed without hesitation. "As long as it doesn't violate my conscience and is within our capabilities, I'll do anything."

"Don't overthink it. I just need your help dealing with a beast."

Xiao Zhi laughed. "That's even better! Eliminating evil creatures is part of my duty as a disciple of the Cloud Azure Sect."

"Good." The man sipped his tea again. "This beast is no ordinary creature—it's being guarded by someone. To deal with the beast, we must first subdue its keeper."

As Xiao Zhi opened his mouth to inquire, another figure emerged from the house—a boy of about fourteen or fifteen.

"Boss," the boy said, "are you really going to heal people from the Cloud Azure Sect? Don't you remember how they—"

"Xiao Qi! Return to your room. This doesn't concern you," the man interrupted sharply. The boy hung his head and retreated. Watching this exchange, Xiao Zhi sensed underlying tensions between this man and his sect, though the reasons remained unclear.

When the white-robed man stood, Xiao Zhi finally noticed his striking youth—he appeared no older than twenty. This contradicted Xiao Zhi's expectations of venerable physicians being elderly sages. The man's delicate, almost feminine features and his leadership of a subordinate further fueled Xiao Zhi's suspicions about his credibility.

"Your magic artifact is impressive," the man remarked, eyeing Xiao Zhi's weapon. "Your cultivation level suggests you hold considerable status in the Cloud Azure Sect. They wouldn't equip a junior disciple with such treasures."

Realizing the man was also a cultivator, Xiao Zhi asked, "Since your skills rival mine, why do you need help with mere beast handlers?"

"The beast itself is manageable," came the reply. "But its guardian is formidable. Together, we should prevail."

Nodding, Xiao Zhi agreed for Guan Yu's sake. "I'm Xiao Zhi. Where's this desert beast?"

"In a cave behind us. Follow me." The physician led through winding paths before stopping. "We strike without negotiation. Just disable the guardian."

Though the physician never offered his name, Xiao Zhi focused on their mission. Descending a slope, they reached a dilapidated hut near a modest cave entrance.

"Who dares trespass?!" boomed a voice from within.

"Don't engage—just attack!" the physician warned. Three figures clashed instantly. Mid-fight, Xiao Zhi recognized familiar techniques in their opponent's movements.

"Hold him here while I handle the beast!" the physician shouted, darting toward the cave. Their adversary roared, "Fool! That demon wolf will bring calamity!" but Xiao Zhi intercepted him.

Despite fierce exchanges, their opponent showed restraint. When wolf howls erupted from the cave, the guardian paled. "You've unleashed disaster! That wolf demon—"

The physician emerged empty-handed and fled without acknowledgment. Realization struck Xiao Zhi—they'd been tricked into releasing a sealed evil. Their opponent's True Sun Sect insignia confirmed his upright status.

Retreating from the overpowering guardian, Xiao Zhi returned to confront the physician. "You used me to bypass a True Sun elder! If my sect hears of this—"

"Enough!" the physician snapped. "Your friend's treatment depends on your cooperation."

When the physician's young attendant complained of hunger, they postponed departure until morning. Under moonlight, Xiao Zhi's anxiety grew—unaware that back at the farmhouse, the blood-poisoned Yan Zhao was attempting to steal Guan Yu's Eight-Sided Drum Technique.

As midnight passed, Yan Zhao's beast transformation unexpectedly triggered despite recent antidotes. His claws elongated, fur sprouted, and rationality vanished—he lunged for Guan Yu's throat. The awakened farmer screamed warnings before being pounced upon.

Meanwhile, Xiao Zhi's restless night pondered Guan Yu's fate. At Demon Soul Sect, Wang Xiaorong awoke from nightmares of Guan Yu maimed. Defying her father's orders, she packed to escape—only to be intercepted by the Demon Lord.

"Return inside," he commanded. "That weakling couldn't protect you from imperial guards last time. I forbid you to see him again!"

As dawn approached, the True Sun guardian inspected the empty cave. Wolf tracks led northeast—toward villages unprepared for the unleashed demon. Gripping his sword, he began pursuit, knowing the coming days would test both his skills and Xiao Zhi's naiveté.
