“Even with countless treasures lying around, merely gazing at them is futile. They must be utilized. If nothing else, one should at least use them to construct magnificent dwellings.”

Guanyu pondered this, deciding he truly ought to return soon to retrieve gold and silver for renovating the mountain estate. Though it might not rival the Cloud Azure Sect’s grandeur, it shouldn’t appear shabby either. Such wealth demanded purposeful use.

Having fortuitously acquired the estate and assumed its lordship, with the ceaseless income from the Swordless Inn below the mountain, Guanyu believed his strategy of seclusion—refusing all challengers—would gradually diminish the inn’s patronage over time.

At dawn the next day, as Guanyu prepared to visit Elder Wang, a knock announced Wang Jun’s arrival.

“I’ve noticed something remarkable about you,” Guanyu remarked. “You never sleep in. Always up at this ungodly hour?”

“Can’t help it,” Wang Jun shrugged. “Since childhood, I’ve needed barely two or three hours’ sleep—less than most elders. Weren’t you heading to Elder Wang? I’ll join you to craft more crossbow bolts.”

“You’ve obtained gold?” Guanyu inquired, knowing Wang Jun’s bolts required gold weighting.

“Naturally. Why else would I come? I need ample bolts before our desert journey—can’t risk shortages there.”

Guanyu studied him. “You’re joining the desert expedition? That’s no pleasure trip. Harsh conditions aside, the dangers are extreme. I advise against it.”

“Adventure is my purpose. Better to brave perils than stagnate in Cloud Azure,” Wang Jun countered.

“This is no jest. Death waits in those sands. I’d rather you stay safe. If boredom plagues you, assist Elder Wang with hand crossbows at Nine Bend River.”

“Do you resent my company?” Wang Jun pressed. “Or fear I’ll disrupt your solitary time with Siqi? Though I’ve no wish to intrude, I know the desert’s dangers. My presence could aid you in crises.”

“I appreciate your intent, but this isn’t child’s play. Lives hang by threads. Are you certain?”

Wang Jun had already secured Wood Hall Master’s conditional approval pending the Sect Leader’s consent—hence his early visit.

“Guanyu,” Wang Jun ventured, “will your ‘Second Brother’ return? His company would ensure safer travels.”

“Xiao Zhi won’t join us—Zheng Hall Master forbids it. Others lack the capability to protect you. Let me accompany you as reinforcement.”

“Very well,” Guanyu conceded, touched. “If Sect Leader Xuanming permits, I’ll accept your aid. My thanks.”

He recognized Wang Jun’s pure protective intent. “I long for Second Brother’s return too. By all logic, he should’ve reported back long ago.”

“Could Feng少爺 have moved against Qiaoyuan District, forcing him to remain?” Wang Jun speculated.

“Unlikely. The Yu Gang and Jones faction wouldn’t permit Qiaoyuan’s compromise. Besides, I’ve avoided escalating conflicts—though dismantling Feng’s entire lineage would be trivial if provoked.”

“Perhaps he’s delayed by other matters. Regardless, I trust Qiaoyuan’s security.”

Suddenly, Guanyu recalled the Yang Clan’s potential threat. Old Master Yang’s notorious ingratitude—having accepted the precious World Honored One’s relic to save his son yet persisting in treachery—posed risks. If Yang sought to eliminate Zhang Han, Qiaoyuan might become collateral damage.

“Your words stir new concerns,” Guanyu admitted. “The Yangs’ current maneuvers worry me.”

“Speculation avails nothing,” Wang Jun dismissed. “Perhaps Second Brother searches for Yezi—Master Jiu’s savior. Should he succeed, Master Jiu’s gratitude will be boundless.”

“True. Overthinking serves no purpose.” Guanyu steeled himself, aware of pressing responsibilities. With Du Xiaojuan and Liu Shilei guarding Qiaoyuan, Yang likely dared not act rashly.

Contemplating Yang’s nearing World Honored realm, Guanyu’s thoughts drifted to unresolved Hua Xia matters—his mental seal compelling his current quest. Memories surfaced: Xue Jing’s whereabouts, A Mei’s beauty studies, Wei Hongwei and Qian Yao’s romance, the Yu Gang’s fate.

His A City exploits—founding the sensational Yu Gang, resolving myriad crises—culminated in this surreal reality after impersonating Qiaoqiao’s suitor.

“Fate decreed this path,” Wang Jun interjected. “Why pine for Hua Xia’s women? Beauties abound here. Contentment brings joy—embrace present fortunes.”

Guanyu acknowledged the wisdom. Companionship here sufficed.

At Elder Wang’s workshop, testing flawed crossbows, the elder greeted them urgently: “Guanyu! These defect rates escalate—trouble brews!”

“Following my instructions, failures shouldn’t occur. Such simple mechanisms...”

“Arrows veer erratically!” Elder Wang demonstrated. “This model appears sound, yet won’t nock properly!”

Inspection revealed asymmetrical bow arms causing imbalance, and insufficient draw strength from shortened beast sinews. After Guanyu’s explanations, the chastened elder grasped the technical nuances.

Guanyu marveled privately—these “master craftsmen” struggling with basic principles. Aloud, he encouraged: “Master components and production accelerates. Persist, Elder Wang.”

Wang Jun requisitioned the forge for gold-weighted bolts, while Guanyu departed to strategize with Sect Leader Xuanming about desert personnel.

“Twenty members suffice,” Guanyu insisted against Xuanming’s fifty-strong proposal. “More bodies mean more casualties.”

Securing approval to select companions—including unsuspecting rivals Ling Shu and Lin Chen for deserved tribulations—Guanyu visited Xiao Zhi at Suspended Peak to examine the enigmatic Beast Taming Manual.

Amidst yellowed, wordless diagrams, Xiao Zhi confessed: “I decipher slowly. Perhaps you’ll find insight?”

Guanyu accepted the ancient text, curiosity piqued—another mystery to unravel.
