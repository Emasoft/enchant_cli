The originally composed Uncle Deng stared dumbfounded at the scene before him. As he watched Young Liu being beaten until his eyes rolled back, that already unpleasant face now appeared even more battered and bruised from the punches and kicks.

Regaining his senses, Uncle Deng rushed forward in two strides. With a whistling side-swing kick, he viciously swept towards Luo Cheng who was straddling Young Liu.

Just as Uncle Deng shifted his weight for the kick, Guan Yu—who had been standing before him—exploded into motion like a bolt from a crossbow! Channeling his Gravity Art to its limits, he dashed forward with a sweeping leg maneuver. His right fist flashed like lightning, smashing directly into Uncle Deng's nose.

Thud! Thud! Thud! Three consecutive punches—a minor combo—sent stars flashing before Uncle Deng's vision as blood gushed from his nostrils. His bulbous onion-shaped nose collapsed under the blows.

Before Uncle Deng could comprehend what happened, the flurry of strikes destroyed his balance, sending him reeling backward. As Guan Yu withdrew like an archer drawing bowstring, gathering all his strength for a final knockout punch, Du Xiaojuan (Little Oriole) screamed from the building entrance: "Stop!"

The already unleashed punch veered sideways at Xiaojuan's cry. Guan Yu twisted his torso mid-strike, the fist grazing past Uncle Deng's cheek and ear with a thunderous BOOM that rattled every window in the building. The concussive force left Uncle Deng's eyes bloodshot before he collapsed unconscious.

The tremendous momentum carried Guan Yu stumbling forward. At the critical moment, he activated his Gravity Art's weight reduction. With a whoosh, he transformed the uncontrolled charge into a soaring somersault. His feet slammed against the building's steel security door with two resounding BANGS before he gracefully landed upright.

The entire sequence lasted mere seconds. When Guan Yu finally stood composed, two massive dents marred the reinforced steel door where his feet had struck.

Luo Cheng gaped from atop Young Liu, while even Niu Le (Happy Ox) stared dumbstruck. "Big Bro," Niu Le finally croaked, "Are we filming a movie here?" The spectacle of someone flying four to five meters through the air defied belief.

Brushing off his hands, Guan Yu glanced at the fallen duo. "Wait in the car," he instructed casually before turning to the building. "I need to have words with whoever sent these two to intercept me."

Rage simmered beneath his controlled tone. Without his Gravity Art and Old Feng's Bone-Shattering Fist techniques, he'd be at these thugs' mercy—dragged to some outskirts to have his legs broken. An ordinary person would've stood no chance against such orchestrated violence.

What truly infuriated him wasn't just protecting Du Xiaojuan from forced transfer, but the sheer disrespect shown despite his courteous approach. That her father would blame him entirely for this consensual elopement...

"Let's go meet your family properly," Guan Yu said coldly to Xiaojuan, gesturing toward the stairwell. "Their welcoming committee speaks volumes."

Xiaojuan worriedly pointed at the unconscious men. "What about—"

"They'll live." Cutting her off, Guan Yu guided her upstairs.

**Chapter 233: Brother or Uncle?**

Du Xueheng sat impassively on the living room sofa, his sister Du Wen (Literary Grace) attempting mediation: "Brother, perhaps let them come up? The boy seems decent—my checks revealed no major issues."

"Meet? After kidnapping my daughter for days?" Du Xueheng snarled. "He thinks parading her here will make me capitulate? Dream on!"

Du Wen persisted: "Xiaojuan says he's been kind. They haven't even—"

"Haven't what? You're a police officer—can't you see through this gold-digging farce?" He glared at his sister. "Some pauper thinks he'll marry into our fortune? Never!"

The doorbell interrupted them. Du Wen answered to find Xiaojuan flanked by a polite young man. "How did you...?" She stared at Guan Yu. The ambush downstairs had failed?

Du Xueheng stormed over—then froze. "Ah! Brother Guan! What brings—" Recognition transformed his fury into effusive hospitality. "Please, come in!"

Guan Yu bowed slightly. "Uncle."

The honorific hung awkwardly as realization struck. "You...you're Xiaojuan's...?"

"The very same." Guan Yu's smile didn't reach his eyes.

Sudden understanding made Du Xueheng slap his thigh heartily. "Family! We're all family here!" He dragged Guan Yu inside, leaving the women bewildered by this sudden camaraderie.

**Chapter 234: Escorts? What Escorts?**

Alone with Guan Yu, Du Xueheng's laughter rang forced. "Had I known it was you, we'd have avoided this...misunderstanding." He winced recalling the hired escorts sent to Guan Yu's hotel—now praying his wife never learned of that night.

Guan Yu sipped tea, allowing the awkwardness to linger. "Your men downstairs might need ambulances."

"Water under the bridge!" Du Xueheng waved dismissively. "Wen! Stop gawking and serve tea properly!"

As Xiaojuan's mother tried coaxing her daughter aside, the girl clung to Guan Yu's sleeve like a lifeline. "I'll stay," she whispered.

"Go," Guan Yu reassured. "I'll be here."

Only when he nodded did Xiaojuan reluctantly follow the women out.

Du Xueheng immediately punched Guan Yu's shoulder in mock reproach. "You rogue! Snatching my daughter then playing humble? You owe me three penalty drinks!"

The restaurant procession revealed more surprises. Niu Le's boisterous presence clashed with Luo Cheng's polite refusal to intrude on family matters. "We've business to—"

"Business later!" Niu Le interrupted. "Prime rib awaits!"

As vehicles departed, Du Xueheng lectured his stunned wife and sister: "That boy's the new Jade King—single-handedly securing three imperial jades in Yunnan! Our company's salvation lies with him!"

Xiaojuan's mother sniffed. "My approval still matters."

"Approval?" Du Xueheng hissed. "That boy's worth ten of me! You'll smile and nod unless you want our daughter mourning lost jade mines!"

In the trailing Land Rover, Xiaojuan finally breathed freely. Guan Yu's hand found hers—a silent promise amidst the chaos they'd weathered...and the greater storms ahead.
