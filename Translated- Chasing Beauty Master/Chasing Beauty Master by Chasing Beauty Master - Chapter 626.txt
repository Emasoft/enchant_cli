Lu Yidie (Butterfly) didn't notice her expression and continued her sister's words, "Exactly, Consort Li! Some even say she'll replace the Queen!" As soon as she finished speaking, she noticed something was wrong. Before she could inquire, Guan Yu crushed the teacup in her hand to splinters, blood trickling down Griffin's arm.

"Hmph! The Murong Family! Murong Qian (Graceful)! You think you can replace Mother? Wishful thinking!" The Lu sisters looked at each other in confusion. Why was their master so furious? Could this be related to the Queen?

"Ugh~ What annoying noise!" Guan Yu stood by the window, looking down at Murong Siqi (Contemplative Jade) with disdain.

Murong Siqi, seeing her opponent was merely a twelve-year-old, grew even more arrogant. "Hey, you little wretch! Don't even think about coveting the Iceflute!" Her inherent dislike for the Murong Family intensified at these words.

"The auction house follows the rule of highest bidder!" Guan Yu coldly declared, her domineering aura palpable. Murong Siqi staggered back in fear before shamefully shouting, "Dare offend the Murong Family, and you'll face retribution!" She stormed out in a huff.

Watching the retreating figure, a ruthless glint flashed in Guan Yu's eyes. Lu Caidie (Colorful Butterfly) gazed at her bleeding hand and softly said, "Master, why provoke the Murongs?" Guan Yu replied frostily, "Those who harm my protected ones must prepare for death!" She sat silently in contemplation.

The Lu sisters exchanged glances. The Murongs were doomed. Thus, the Iceflute fell unquestionably into Guan Yu's possession, while the demon crystals she brought caused a sensation, finally selling for ninety billion – setting Blue Universe Auction House's historical record!

Soon, the Iceflute was delivered. "Honored guest, your acquired treasure."

The attendant respectfully presented the flute. Guan Yu stored it away, noticing the man lingering. "Anything else?" Lu Yidie asked. Trembling, the man stammered, "N-nothing!" before fleeing. He'd hoped to see the flute's owner, never expecting a child whose mere glance radiated killing intent. Curiosity nearly killed this cat!

Watching his panicked escape, Lu Yidie wondered – did they look like ghosts? Guan Yu, oblivious, left with them, underestimating Murong Siqi's resolve. Strolling through streets, Guan Yu darted between shops with childlike delight, momentarily forgetting vendettas.

The sisters exchanged smiles – their master was still a child after all! Suddenly, Guan Yu stopped before a building. Lu Caidie followed her gaze and gasped – a brothel!

As Lu Caidie froze, Lu Yidie tried pulling Guan Yu away, but the girl stood firm. Guan Yu's mischievous stare made Lu Caidie uneasy. "Master, just tell me what you want!"

With a wicked smile, Guan Yu whispered instructions. Lu Caidie's face lit up. "Understood!" She turned to her sister, "Listen well to Master in my absence." Lu Yidie tearfully watched her leave. Guan Yu, seeing her distress, whispered new orders. Lu Yidie nodded and vanished.

Alone again, Guan Yu clenched her healing fist. Murong Family!

Suddenly sensing movement, she smirked. Still persistent? What's mine stays mine! Leading pursuers on a tedious chase, she nearly yawned aloud – attack already!

Earthly Sovereign-level Black Crows surrounded her. Guan Yu sighed – Murong Siqi sent these weaklings? They fell instantly. Meanwhile, Murong Siqi awaited good news, unaware her crows were extinct.

In the Underworld Palace, the Underworld King embraced a seductress while addressing Tian Huanyun (Illusory Cloud): "Prepare for tomorrow's banquet." His tone brooked no refusal.

The woman purred, "Sister must dress properly – don't embarrass His Majesty!" Murong Qian's eyes flashed disgust at Tian Huanyun's faint cheek marks. Without glancing back, Tian Huanyun left, missing the King's conflicted gaze.

Murong Qian noticed his lingering stare and jealousy flared. "She's just a hostage princess," the King murmured – to her or himself?

Returning to her chambers, Tian Huanyun found her maid flustered. "Zhuer, what's wrong?" The maid bowed, "Just worried for you, Queen."

Guan Yu crouched on the palace roof, fists clenched. Hostage princess? Just wait, Akali Li! Tomorrow's banquet will be memorable!

A figure approached. "Since when does the top genius stalk people?" Guan Yu sneered.

Night Wuchen (Endless Trace) smiled, "And why does Lady Xiuluo visit the Underworld Palace?" His eyes glinted with calculation.

"Last I checked, this isn't Demon Realm," she retorted, vanishing into night. Night Wuchen stared after her – who was she? The mystery deepened.

Meanwhile, Murong Siqi paced anxiously. How could a twelve-year-old defeat her assassins? Little did she know they played mahjong in hell.

Back at the inn, Guan Yu recalled Akali Li's betrayal. Unforgivable! Tomorrow's surprise would be priceless. Examining the Iceflute, she found it ordinary except for familiar magic circles – her Soul-Devouring Whip remained unique.

Suddenly, the flute glowed blue. A voice urged, "Blood pact!" Complying, the flute transformed into crystalline purity as music scores flooded her mind. Channeling energy, icy air froze the room – a worthy treasure indeed!

At dawn, Guan Yu's crimson hair darkened to ebony, eyes becoming night itself – regressing to six years past, though bloodstained hands proved it no dream.

In the palace garden, Ming Hanfeng (Cold Breeze) clutched a tiny bell until interrupted by Murong Yuhan (Rain Chill). "Your Highness, the banquet begins."

The prince pocketed his treasure coldly. Meanwhile, Murong Qian preened before her mirror – today she'd usurp Tian Huanyun's place!

Night Wuchen stood brooding until reminded of the event. As he descended, a scream pierced the air – Murong Siqi gaped at his beauty. Repulsed by her perfume, he changed clothes, inexplicably recalling another's subtle fragrance.

The banquet commenced with Akali Li toasting guests. Murong Siqi approached Night Wuchen, batting eyelashes at his indifference.

When music started, a voice froze the hall: "Did my dear adoptive father start without me?"

All turned as a white-clad girl appeared – ebony hair flowing, veil removed to reveal devastating beauty. "Father, I'm home."

Akali Li staggered. "Impossible!" Murong Qian shouted for guards as gasps erupted.

Bingsu and others stared in shock. "Long time no see, Sister Bingsu, Lion King." Guan Yu's gaze pierced Akali Li. "You shouldn't have survived the Abyss!"

The crowd marveled – this peerless beauty had emerged from certain death! Night Wuchen's chest tightened, disliking others admiring her. Ming Hanfeng trembled – was this reality?

Murong Qian clung to Akali Li, simpering, "I prepared a surprise!" Dozens of dancers entered as music swelled – interrupted by Guan Yu's icy declaration: "How dare you begin without me?"

Chaos erupted. Night Wuchen's eyes widened. Ming Hanfeng and Akali Li paled. Tian Huanyun searched desperately for the voice's owner.

The veiled girl appeared, removing her covering to stun the crowd. Akali Li murmured denial as Murong Qian screeched for arrests.

"Bingsu, Lion King – missed me?" Guan Yu's smile chilled. "Adoptive Father, your prodigal daughter returns!"

The hall erupted. She'd survived the inescapable! Her ethereal beauty captivated all. Night Wuchen's possessiveness surged while Ming Hanfeng feared this mirage might vanish.

Murong Qian's "surprise" dancers stood forgotten as history's gears shifted – the true storm had arrived.
