Gao Wei gave a bitter smile, furrowing her brows as she glanced at Du Xiaojuan before waving Guan Yu aside with a gesture.

"Must be her family again... Xiaojuan was pampered growing up. They’re overly protective and never let her go out at night!" Seeing Guan Yu’s confusion, Gao Wei casually explained, adjusting the sunglasses on her nose.

Having known Du Xiaojuan for so long, Gao Wei was intimately familiar with her temperament and family dynamics. Such scenes were commonplace to her.

"Treat Xiaojuan well. She’s a simple, good girl. It’s clear she likes you," Gao Wei said calmly, turning to study Guan Yu.

"It’s not... I... it’s not what you think!" Guan Yu sniffed awkwardly, stumbling over his words.

"Enough. I know Xiaojuan’s personality better than anyone. If you dare hurt or deceive her, I’ll be the first to make you pay! How could you bear to harm such an innocent, trusting girl?"

"I..." Guan Yu pursed his lips helplessly, rendered speechless.

**Chapter Ninety-Two: Provocation by Delinquent Youths**

Guan Yu didn’t bother explaining further. *Whatever she thinks, let her. My relationship with Xiaojuan is... complicated anyway,* he mused inwardly.

Du Xiaojuan answered her phone with a hushed voice. "Dad, I’m really in the dorm! Huh? They didn’t see me—I just went to do laundry! What? Since when can’t I wash clothes?"

"Fine, I’ll come now." Hanging up with a resigned sigh, she looked pleadingly at Guan Yu and Gao Wei.

"Disaster! My dad’s coming. My aunt told him about the incident. Now I have to go to her place. There goes our fun!" Her shoulders slumped in defeat.

Gao Wei waved reassuringly. "Don’t worry. We’ll hang out another time. Hurry back—your dad’s waiting."

"Okay... I’ll go then. Guan Yu, take care of Sister Weiwei. Make sure she gets back to the hotel safely," Du Xiaojuan urged, pouting apologetically.

Guan Yu smiled and nodded. "Relax. I’ll walk you to the taxi."

After seeing Du Xiaojuan off, Guan Yu breathed easier. Gao Wei stood nearby, arms crossed, watching him impassively.

"Now that Xiaojuan’s gone, I should head back too."

"Let me escort you," Guan Yu offered quickly.

"No need. I’ll take a cab. Thanks for the gift," she replied softly, lifting the plush teddy bear before turning to hail a taxi.

Guan Yu shoved his hands into his pockets, studying her retreating figure. *A superstar—always out of reach. Even after talking, she feels miles away. But we’ve only known each other a day,* he reasoned with a shrug.

As he turned to leave, engines roared. Seven or eight youths on racing motorcycles revved toward Gao Wei, brandishing bats and wooden clubs.

The lead rider aimed straight for her.

"Ah!" Gao Wei leaped aside with a scream. The rider braked sharply, rear wheel lifting before slamming down inches from her.

Panicked, Gao Wei spun to seek Guan Yu. Another youth yanked her white cap off, circling mockingly before speeding back toward her.

"Hey!" A slap cracked through the air as Guan Yu hauled a rider off his bike.

"Fuck! Run him over!" the gang shouted, charging.

Guan Yu lunged, pulling Gao Wei clear of the first bike. With no escape from the second, he shoved her toward a tree and kicked the oncoming motorcycle.

*Boom!* The bike flipped. Guan Yu skidded back, saved by his Gravity Control Technique.

Bystanders gaped as he flipped another bike mid-charge, rider skidding across asphalt.

"Try me," Guan Yu taunted, blood dripping from his knuckles. The remaining thug fled, hurling empty threats.

"All right now?" Guan Yu handed Gao Wei her dust-strewn cap.

She stared, dazed. "This... feels like a movie. You flipped motorcycles! Took on seven alone!"

"Let me take you back," he urged, eyeing the groaning riders.

Before she could reply, twenty more bikes rounded the corner.

"Shit!" Guan Yu grabbed her hand. "Run!"

**Chapter Ninety-Three: The Great Escape**

Sprinting to a parked bike, Guan Yu ignited the engine. "Get on!"

Gao Wei clung to him as they shot forward, gang in pursuit. Wind roared as they hit suburban roads, bikes gaining.

"Hold tight!" Guan Yu activated Gravity Control, the bike rocketing forward like a bullet.

**Chapter Ninety-Four: Rocket or Jetplane?**

The motorcycle became a blur, scenery whipping past. Gao Wei shut her eyes, heart pounding.

The pursuing gang faltered, stunned. *What kind of speed is this—a fucking rocket?!*

Guan Yu squinted against the gale, tears streaking back. The world narrowed to speed and survival.
