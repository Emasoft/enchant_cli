Guan Yu completely ignored his words, chuckling, “How do you know my luck can’t defeat your cards? Don’t speak too confidently before the cards are revealed, lest you embarrass yourself.”

With that, Guan Yu flipped over his hole card.

Chapter 594: Elimination (Part 1)

“All thunder and no rain, just putting on airs.” This was the collective judgment of the four others at the gambling table regarding Guan Yu.

Yet when they clearly saw the card revealed, their prepared taunts died on their lips. The reason was simple—Guan Yu’s hole card was a two, making three-of-a-kind with twos in his hand, beating Boss Sun’s two pairs.

“Hmph!”

Boss Sun braced both hands on the table, staring wide-eyed at the revealed card. His face cycled through a kaleidoscope of expressions as he muttered, “Impossible... How could it be three twos?”

“What’s impossible?” Guan Yu sneered. “I told you not to speak too boldly. Embarrassing yourself serves no purpose.”

“You—” Boss Sun pointed furiously at Guan Yu, rendered speechless.

Moments earlier he’d mocked Guan Yu’s so-called luck, only to be slapped silent by those three twos. Though the truth lay plainly before him, he could only emit a heavy snort before collapsing back into his seat.

“Boss, your luck’s insane! Even three twos? Tsk tsk.” Niu Le laughed boisterously, heedless of Boss Sun’s feelings, greedily sweeping the chips into his arms as if he’d personally won the pot. This display further darkened Boss Sun’s expression.

“Boss, we just won 25 million this round!” Niu Le counted the chips with malicious glee. “At this rate, their 50 million won’t last long.”

Ignoring the increasingly sour expressions around them, Guan Yu joined the laughter. “Today’s luck favors me. Their 50 million can’t compare, ha!”

“Arrogant fool!” Fatty Ma finally snapped, unable to contain himself.

“When luck becomes your capital, why not flaunt it?” Guan Yu retorted without backing down. “Feel free to swagger too—if you’ve got the means.”

Fatty Ma choked on his anger. Though desperate to refute Guan Yu, the evidence of superior fortune left him red-faced and sputtering. Turning impatiently to the dealer, he barked, “Start the next round!”

“Since someone’s eager to donate money, we’d best hurry.” Guan Yu sat down smiling, his sarcasm unmistakable.

The dealer, long accustomed to reading atmospheres, swiftly broke open a fresh deck and began shuffling with practiced flair. Fatty Ma and Boss Sun watched like generals surveying a battlefield, their competitive fury stoked by Guan Yu’s provocations.

Chu Hong observed differently. While the men focused on personal grudges, the casino hostess memorized cards through trained expertise—a master gambler tracking the top few cards to deduce opponents’ hands. Zhou Jin employed psychology instead, studying micro-expressions to assess hidden strengths.

Yet Guan Yu remained an enigma. Chatting casually with Niu Le without even checking his hole card, he appeared the picture of nonchalance—even as the casino manager winced at their crude tea-drinking antics with premium Pu’er leaves.

“Looks like Lady Luck favors me first again.” Guan Yu grinned at his newly dealt Ace of Hearts. “Five million to start.” He casually tossed in chips worth a fortune.

The betting escalated dramatically. When Guan Yu revealed a second Ace, Fatty Ma sneered about “dumb luck” despite his own three Kings. Zhou Jin calmly matched raises while Boss Sun hesitated before succumbing to peer pressure.

By the fifth card, over 240 million hung in the balance. Guan Yu sipped tea serenely as tension thickened the air. His final ten completed two pairs—Aces and tens. Yet his smile never wavered, the trap already sprung.

“Two pairs—Aces and tens. Mr. Guan’s turn to speak,” the dealer announced.

Guan Yu’s fingers drummed the table, the calm before unleashing his gambit. The real game had only just begun.
