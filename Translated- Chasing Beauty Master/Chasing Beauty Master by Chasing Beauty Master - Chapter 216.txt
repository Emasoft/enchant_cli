“However, I must remind you—the bomb will detonate in half an hour. Don’t think of calling reinforcements. You have neither the time nor the opportunity. Otherwise, I’ll send your woman to meet God ahead of schedule.” The young man gave Guan Yu no chance to respond before hanging up.

Guan Yu’s eyes turned icy as he clenched his phone. Were it not military-grade, the device would have shattered to pieces.

He inhaled deeply and dialed Luo Cheng’s number. “You have five minutes to deliver what you took from Director Nie to the school. And bring me a gun.”

……

Within a cramped workshop of the abandoned Tongda Factory, the stench of mold mingled with cigarette smoke. Five youths stood inside, chain-smoking one cigarette after another.

Li Xi sat bound to a chair, brows tightly furrowed—whether in disdain for these youths’ actions or anxiety over Guan Yu charging into this death trap remained unclear.

The young man had used speakerphone during his call. Hearing every word exchanged, Li Xi knew Guan Yu would come despite the certain doom. Yet as she watched the ever-changing numbers on the explosive device strapped to her chest, her calm facade barely contained the turmoil beneath.

Before her stood a pale, unsteady man whose debauched lifestyle radiated from his hollow frame. His fiery red hair earned him the nickname Huomao (Flaming Hair). His gaze lingered shamelessly on Li Xi’s prominent curves, saliva nearly dripping, yet he restrained his beastly urges. Greater priorities demanded focus.

“Brother Huomao,” a green-haired youth crushed his cigarette butt, “you think that bastard Guan Yu will show?”

“Hmph.” Huomao sneered. “If he’s not here within thirty minutes, we send this bitch to meet God.” A lecherous grin followed. “Of course, we’ll enjoy her thoroughly first. That bastard’s luck defies reason—how’d he land a beauty like this?”

“But even flying here from downtown would take an hour minimum,” Green-Hair protested.

Huomao smirked, offering no explanation. Green-Hair suddenly understood—this excuse merely masked Huomao’s lust. Eyeing Li Xi hungrily, he growled, “This slut nearly ruined our plans. Let’s teach her a lesson now while we wait!”

As Green-Hair reached for Li Xi’s chest, Huomao seized his collar and slapped him twice before kicking his thigh. Green-Hair stumbled onto the damp floor, clutching his swollen face. “What’s the difference between now and later?” he whined.

“Difference?” Huomao roared. “Who said anything about fucking her later? You think with drained balls you’ll complete the boss’s mission? Cock-brained imbecile!”

“But you said—”

“I said that to pressure Guan Yu into rushing here!” Huomao snapped. “We’ll enjoy her after eliminating him. Blow this mission, and the boss will skin us alive. Use your fucking brain!”

Green-Hair paled at the mention of their leader’s ruthlessness. “I...I won’t mess up again.”

……

“Who’s your boss?” Li Xi’s cold gaze pierced the two delinquents.

Huomao studied her with interest. “Smart women die faster when they ask questions.”

“Did Wan Qianshan send you?” she pressed.

“Wan Qianshan?” Huomao snorted. “I’d savor my last moments if I were you. Dead men keep secrets—dying women? Not so much.”

Li Xi fell silent, having gleaned her answer. Huomao’s confusion revealed his ignorance of Wan Qianshan. Yet if not the Taiwanese mogul, who else would target Guan Yu through her? The puzzle deepened—how had Wan’s influence reached mainland China? His sudden invitation to N City now reeked of conspiracy.

……

Outside the factory, two snipers and three gunmen lay in ambush. Inside the workshop, Huomao puffed his cigarette smugly. Everything was set—whether Guan Yu breached their defenses or not, death awaited.

Fifteen minutes later, Huomao’s phone vibrated. The cigarette fell from his lips as he stared at the message. “He’s here.”

“Impossible!” Green-Hair choked. “He’d need a fucking jet!”

“No reinforcements.” Huomao bared yellowed teeth. “Let’s grant his death wish.”

……

Li Xi’s eyes snapped open at the sudden gunshot. Silence returned. Huomao grinned. “One shot—done.”

But the snipers knew better. Their bullet had somehow missed as Guan Yu vanished like a ghost. Three gunmen advanced with night vision goggles, closing their net.

Guan Yu crouched behind crates, breath ragged. Two near-death encounters today, yet he’d raced here, driven by the bomb’s countdown. His探查系统 (Detection System) had warned him milliseconds before the sniper fired—just enough to dodge.

Activating his重力减轻系统 (Gravity Reduction System), he became a blur. A gunshot echoed as he drew fire, his沙漠之鹰 (Desert Eagle) flashing. Though inexperienced, his探查系统 mapped every enemy position. From his waist pouch, venomous snakes and scorpions crept forth—his secret weapons cultivated through the宠物系统 (Pet System).

The ambush reversed. As Guan Yu drew fire, his creatures struck—vipers coiling around snipers’ necks, toxins paralyzing screams. Three gunmen found poisonous insects crawling under their collars. Muffled gurgles replaced gunfire.

By the time Guan Yu slowed his enhanced movements, five enemies lay dead. He reloaded, eyes burning with lethal intent. Somewhere ahead, Li Xi waited—and he’d carve through hell itself to reach her.
