Before getting into the car, Guan Yu paused and turned to look at Xiao Xiong, saying, “Brother Xiao, I’ll trouble you to take care of Niu Le. After everything is resolved, let him stay here to gain more experience. When the time is right, let him return to N City.”

“Don’t worry. With me here, Niu Le won’t die,” Xiao Xiong promised.

Guan Yu said nothing more. He entered the vehicle and pushed the Hummer’s performance to its limits, disregarding speeding violations entirely. Gripping the steering wheel tightly, he murmured, “Sis, you must hold on until I return.”

The patriarchs of the Feng, Xu, and Lin families had all been attacked. Among the current heads of the three families, only Feng Xin had been critically targeted—the very reason for Guan Yu’s fury.

As thoughts of Feng Xin’s precarious condition flooded his mind, the Hummer accelerated further. Guan Yu had activated the gravity reduction system.

By the time he reached N City in the afternoon, he drove straight to Feng Xin’s residence. Approaching the villa, he spotted over a dozen men stationed nearby—the situation was worse than anticipated.

Exiting the car, Guan Yu watched as the guards immediately reached into their jackets. Their tension eased upon recognizing him.

With a grave expression, Guan Yu demanded, “Take me to see the Old Master.”

He was swiftly led to the living room where Luo Cheng awaited. It was Luo Cheng who had informed him of N City’s turmoil.

Seeing Guan Yu enter, Luo Cheng stood urgently. “Brother Yu! You’re back! Hurry to see the Old Master—he… he might not…” His voice trailed off.

Guan Yu’s heart sank. Taking the stairs two at a time, he found Old Master Feng lying pale on a hospital bed, his body riddled with tubes. Activating his diagnostic system, Guan Yu examined the patriarch’s condition and clenched his fists.

Five bullet wounds marred the old man’s body, including a sniper shot to the leg. The devastating impact had nearly destroyed the limb, leaving him clinging to life by a thread.

Luo Cheng entered quietly. Noticing Guan Yu’s whitened knuckles, he said mournfully, “The doctors say his survival is a miracle, but… they don’t know how long he’ll last.” His voice then hardened with rage. “Those bastards! Attacking a man in his twilight years—I’ll skin them alive!”

Guan Yu remained silent. Placing his hand over the bullet wound, he closed his eyes. The ancient coin in his mind—encircled by blue flames—hummed to life. A surge of vital energy flowed through his arm into the patriarch’s leg.

The enhanced healing effects from his recent power upgrade became evident. Though only Guan Yu understood the terrifying potency of this 60% amplification, he watched as shattered bone and tissue regenerated visibly. Given time, he could fully restore the Old Master.

But such miraculous healing drained energy exponentially. After mere seconds, Guan Yu’s face paled. Shifting his hand to the patriarch’s heart, he channeled another wave of blue energy before withdrawing.

Relief washed over him. The Old Master was now out of critical danger. With continued treatment over two months, even the doctors’ prognosis of permanent wheelchair confinement would be proven wrong—such was the might of his enhanced healing system.

Guan Yu marveled inwardly. If 60% power achieved this, full mastery would be godlike. Yet upgrades came unpredictably—this recent breakthrough had followed a desperate crisis. Previous attempts to force progress by exhausting his energy had failed.

Turning to Luo Cheng, he asked softly, “Where’s Feng Xin?”

Luo Cheng’s expression darkened. “Sister Xin… is in the adjacent room.”

Rushing to the next chamber, Guan Yu froze at the sight before him. His lips trembled as he approached the bed. Feng Xin’s condition rivaled the patriarch’s—her entire body swathed in bandages, face included. His scan revealed horrific burns covering most of her body.

“Sister Xin was closest to the explosion,” Luo Cheng rasped. “They planted bombs in your villa. When she entered… everything blew apart.” He glanced at her shrouded form and fell silent.

Guan Yu inhaled deeply, struggling to contain his murderous rage. Placing a shaking hand over Feng Xin’s chest, he poured wave after wave of healing energy into her until nearing depletion. Staring at her pain-twisted features, he fought through exhaustion to return to the living room.

Luo Cheng mistook his pallor for grief. “Brother Yu, you must take care of yourself.”

“Tell me,” Guan Yu growled, eyes blazing with madness, “which reincarnation-hungry bastards did this?”

This was a lion provoked beyond reason—primed for bloody vengeance.

Luo Cheng scarcely recognized the man before him—this aura of violent wrath chilled him to the core.

“There was a traitor among Sister Xin’s inner circle,” Luo Cheng hurriedly explained. “They leaked her and the Old Master’s movements.”

“Zhou Jin,” Guan Yu spat, eyes bloodshot. Chu Hong hadn’t lied—Zhou Jin’s mole had penetrated deep, succeeding despite prior warnings.

“Was the traitor identified?”

Luo Cheng nodded. “Yuan Sheng—a trusted aide. He vanished after the attack. We’re still hunting him.”

“Yuan Sheng,” Guan Yu repeated, adding the name to his death list. Zhou Jin would die, but so would every betrayer. The image of his beloved lying broken erased all mercy.

“The other patriarchs?”

“Their stewards poisoned them. Though saved in time, both remain comatose.”

“What of Lin Qiang and Xu Bin?”

“Both were away on business—they escaped. Otherwise…”

“Any attacks on you?”

Luo Cheng’s eyes glinted. “They tried. Lost men instead.”

Surprised by Luo Cheng’s competence, Guan Yu pressed, “What did you learn from the corpses?”

“Zhou Jin orchestrated everything. Without concrete evidence, even Commissioner Nie can’t touch him.”

Guan Yu raised an eyebrow—extracting Zhou Jin’s name from dead men spoke volumes.

“The current situation?”

“Chaos. With the patriarchs fallen, vultures vie for power. Zhou Jin snatches territories while fools squabble over titles. Our forces… suffered heavy losses.” Luo Cheng’s voice broke. “Brother Yu… I failed to protect what we built.”

“No,” Guan Yu corrected coldly. “Those who harmed my brothers and stole my lands will repay tenfold. First, interest comes due.”

“What will you do?”

“Secure our house, then purge the outsiders. Yuan Sheng dies tonight. Gather Lin Qiang, Xu Bin, and the troublemakers at Xu’s place by nine. Let’s see if that Taiwan trash still dares strut in N City.”

As Luo Cheng moved to mobilize men, Guan Yu stopped him. “No troops. I go alone.”

“But Zhou Jin’s prepared! He might—”

“I’ve stormed armories alone. Nine o’clock.” Guan Yu left before Luo Cheng could protest.

Outside, Guan Yu’s expression darkened further. Memories of Feng Xin’s broken form and Mo Ling’s recent near-death—both victims of Wan Qianshan’s schemes—ignited his fury. The upgraded coin’s power thrummed in his veins. Tonight, blood would flow.

At nine sharp, the faction leaders gathered at Xu Bin’s estate. The door burst open as Guan Yu tossed in a corpse—Yuan Sheng’s lifeless body. “Apologies,” he said, scanning the room. “Housekeeping delayed me.”

The assembly froze.

Guan Yu knew everything about Huang Ming—Wan Qianshan’s top enforcer and strategist.

**Chapter 661: Critical Strike**

Chu Hong bit her lip, staring at Zhou Jin’s gun pressed to her temple. Summoned by Wan Qianshan days earlier, she’d been imprisoned—now realizing this was a loyalty test.

Could Guan Yu save her? Given the ambush awaiting him here, he likely suspected her betrayal. Resigned, she closed her eyes.

“Guan Yu! Never thought you’d show!” Zhou Jin sneered.

Her eyes flew open—there he stood. Tears blurred her vision.

“Only good at using women as shields, I see,” Guan Yu taunted.

*Bang!*

A bullet tore through Guan Yu’s thigh. He staggered but remained standing.

“No more talk.” Zhou Jin cocked the hammer. “Drop your gun. Every five seconds you hold it, she takes a bullet.”

“Run!” Chu Hong screamed.

*Bang!* Zhou Jin shot her leg without hesitation. “Another word, another round.”

Guan Yu immediately dropped his weapon.

“Why?” Chu Hong whispered, face ashen. “Why stay?”

“You’re mine,” he answered, forcing a smile. Inside, he calculated frantically—buying time was their only hope.

Chu Hong’s breath hitched.
