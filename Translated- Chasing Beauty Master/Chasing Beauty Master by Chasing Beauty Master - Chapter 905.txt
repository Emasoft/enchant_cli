“Second-to-Wolf found some sense in Guan Yu’s words and sat back down, his mood easing considerably. His sole concern was ensuring Sakurako’s happiness after her marriage to Guan Yu.

Guan Yu knew Second-to-Wolf was a pure martial artist—well-versed in martial arts but utterly clueless in matters of the heart.

‘How about this,’ Guan Yu suggested. ‘After I return this time, I’ll bring Sakurako here first. Let her stay with us for a while so everyone can get acquainted. We can discuss further plans afterward. What do you think?’

Unexpectedly, even this proposal was rejected. Second-to-Wolf tilted his head, deep in thought. Guan Yu pressed on, ‘This is for Sakurako’s happiness. She needs time to adapt to life in Qiaoyuan District and build good relationships there. These things take time, don’t you agree?’

‘No! Why must Sakurako go to Qiaoyuan District? You’ve already got so many women there. What’s the point?’ Second-to-Wolf retorted angrily.

‘Qiaoyuan is my home. Where else would she stay?’ Guan Yu replied helplessly, frustrated by his friend’s stubbornness.

‘Enough nonsense! What does your home matter? Isn’t Jinhua kept outside anyway?’ Second-to-Wolf, usually composed, shocked Guan Yu with this blunt remark.

‘No! Why must Sakurako go to Qiaoyuan District? You’ve already got so many women there. What’s the point?’ Second-to-Wolf repeated heatedly.

‘Qiaoyuan is my home. Where else would she stay?’ Guan Yu sighed, exasperated.

‘Enough! What does your home matter? Isn’t Jinhua kept outside anyway?’

Guan Yu’s face darkened at the implication that Jinhua was his mistress. While technically true—her secrecy stemmed from conflicts with the Yang family, not fear of his other women—the accusation stung.

‘Calm down. This isn’t simple,’ Guan Yu insisted. ‘If Sakurako agrees, I can arrange a separate residence. But marriage requires careful planning. Shouldn’t our wedding be grand? If it’s public, her residence won’t matter. And consider my situation—how will the others react if I suddenly marry her?’

‘So you’re unwilling? Afraid she’ll burden you?’ Second-to-Wolf’s expression turned dangerous.

‘I never said that! I want her here. Even if my memories don’t return, time together will rekindle our bond. Be patient.’

Second-to-Wolf relented slightly. ‘What’s your plan? Sakurako deserves proper treatment.’

Guan Yu exhaled. ‘Bring her here first. Let us reconnect. To me now, she’s a stranger. We need time.’

Second-to-Wolf nodded. ‘I don’t demand immediate marriage, but she’s suffered enough. Her only joy comes from news of you.’

Touched, Guan Yu resolved to consult Xu Jinglei about Sakurako after finding Jinhua’s master. He’d honor her devotion but remained cautious—trusting only his women in Qiaoyuan and Hua Yu Group’s leaders.

‘I’ll settle this after my current mission. Give me time,’ Guan Yu promised.

‘What mission? Must she wait years more?’

‘This mission is perilous. Would you risk her safety here?’

Second-to-Wolf conceded. ‘Fine. But once back in Huaxia, fetch her immediately. She’s waited too long.’

Relieved, Guan Yu added, ‘You know my character. My women lack nothing. Qiaoyuan’s safety proves it.’

Second-to-Wolf agreed, recalling Guan Yu’s meticulous protection. ‘Just give her status before your other women. Not too much to ask?’

**Chapter Two Thousand Three Hundred and Sixteen: Unable to Approach**

‘Of course. All my women receive equal care,’ Guan Yu vowed, valuing Second-to-Wolf’s past aid against assassins.

Pleased, Second-to-Wolf mused, ‘She’ll rejoice at joining you in Huaxia.’

Their bond evident, Guan Yu recognized securing Sakurako meant retaining a First-Class Honor Mid-Rank ally—a priceless asset even wealth couldn’t buy.

Conversation turned to Guan Yu’s stagnant cultivation. ‘How is your strength frozen?’ Second-to-Wolf frowned.

‘Post-injury, my energy never grows despite training.’

Second-to-Wolf probed Guan Yu’s meridians, gasping as a vortex in his brain repelled the intrusion. ‘A sealing vortex! Unapproachable!’

Guan Yu paled—this mirrored Zhang Han’s condition. Had he too been memory-sealed?

‘Explain!’ he urged.

‘Your brain harbors a vortex that nearly drained me. I dare not probe again.’

Stunned, Guan Yu connected this to Zhang Han’s identical seal. Were both their memories and powers suppressed?

**Chapter Two Thousand Three Hundred and Seventeen: Severity Revealed**

The parallels chilled Guan Yu. Like Zhang Han, his amnesia and stagnant cultivation suggested external manipulation.

‘What did you see?’ he pressed.

‘A violent whirlpool defying approach. My energy was nearly devoured,’ Second-to-Wolf shuddered.

Realization dawned: Guan Yu’s cultivation surpassed even a First-Class Honor Mid-Rank expert. But who could impose such a seal?

As questions multiplied, Guan Yu’s resolve hardened—to unravel this mystery, recover his past, and protect those he cherished.
