At that moment, a grand procession emerged from within. From afar, Prince Zou recognized them as palace eunuchs.

Behind the entourage rolled an opulent carriage drawn by four snow-white steeds. The prince knew this delegation had been sent by the Emperor himself to receive him.

The extravagant welcoming party somewhat soothed Prince Zou's wounded pride. Having endured countless trials along his journey, these experiences had irrevocably altered both his temperament and worldview.

"Your Highness," an elderly eunuch greeted with a deep bow, "His Majesty dispatched this humble servant to escort you. The Emperor has been awaiting your arrival with great anticipation."

Heartened by the imperial display, Prince Zou replied, "We shall trouble Your Excellency to lead the way." With a subtle glance at Zou Wuhen, his attendant discreetly pressed a silver ingot into the eunuch's palm – necessary courtesies the prince well understood in this world of favors.

The eunuch's smile broadened at the metallic weight. "The journey must have wearied Your Highness. His Majesty decrees you may attend court immediately without observing formal protocols."

Normally, a prince in travel-stained garments would need days of purification before imperial audience. This unprecedented exception left Zou momentarily overwhelmed by royal favor.

"Would it not be disrespectful to appear before the Son of Heaven in this disheveled state?" the prince demurred. "Allow me to cleanse the road's dust from my person first."

"The Emperor's command brooks no delay," the eunuch insisted, though his tone remained honeyed. "Shall we keep His Celestial Majesty waiting?"

"Since you insist," Zou acquiesced after brief hesitation. "Pray grant me a moment to instruct my retinue."

Meanwhile, Yu Shu's contingent had departed to report to the Crown Prince, while the scarred warrior called Scarlet secured carts to honor his fallen comrades with proper burial. Only Guan Yu's band of mercenaries and Jianghu fighters remained – men the prince desperately wished to retain.

Drawing Guan Yu aside, Prince Zou murmured, "My gratitude remains inadequate. You've..."

"Court formalities are unnecessary," Guan Yu interrupted with a knowing smile. "Our duty from Cloud Azure Sect is complete now that you're safe. Master Xuanming sends his regards."

The prince's eyes widened in realization. "I should have guessed! No ordinary guards would brave such perils. Convey my deepest thanks to your sect leader. Cloud Azure Mountain shall receive this prince's personal visit when circumstances permit."

As Guan Yu made to depart, Prince Zou entreated, "One final request – honor me with a farewell banquet tomorrow. Let proper ceremony mark our parting."

After securing Guan Yu's assent, the prince turned to logistics. Sixteen of the twenty mercenaries chose permanent service – bolstering a retinue reduced to Zou Wuhen alone. The rest were persuaded to linger for ceremonial send-offs.

Seated in the imperial carriage, Prince Zou gazed at the sprawling capital unfolding before him. The palace complex dominated the city's heart, its golden roofs gleaming like a gilded lotus amidst urban sprawl.

At the Crown Prince's estate, an unprecedented scene unfolded. The heir apparent himself waited at the vermilion gates to personally welcome Jianghu vagabonds. Through arched courtyards and peony-lined corridors, Guan Yu's group marveled at estates where rockeries mimicked mountain ranges and koi ponds mirrored cloudscapes.

During the lavish feast, whispers circulated about Guan Yu's true identity. When directly questioned, Zou Wuhen deftly deflected: "Many brave souls fell defending His Highness. Perhaps your admired hero lies among them."

As night descended, Guan Yu found himself dragged from sleep by Wang Xiaorong's insistent demands for moonlit shopping. Reluctantly shouldering a coin purse, he escorted the two women through lantern-lit streets toward Lovers' Peak – a hilltop thrumming with night markets, where legend spoke of hermits sustained by miraculous fruits.

Through it all, the prince's carriage rolled inexorably toward destiny, wheels crushing fallen magnolia blossoms as it ascended to the Seat of Heaven.
