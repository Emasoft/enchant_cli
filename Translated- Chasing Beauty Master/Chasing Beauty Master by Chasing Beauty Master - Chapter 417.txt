“Here,” Dongfang Mu produced a business card bearing only a simple surname “Jiang” and a phone number.

“Jiang?” Guan Yu’s heart leapt. Could it be...

“Heh, close to what you’re thinking!” Dongfang Mu affirmed without denial. “With him present, nothing in Taiwan will be beyond your resolution.”

If it truly was that family, then indeed no obstacle remained. Guan Yu ceased refusal. “In that case, thank you, Elder Brother. Once matters there settle smoothly, I’ll hasten back for the Patriarch’s birthday celebration.”

Now resolved, he felt liberated—what was there to fear from Dongfang Huowu? She wasn’t some ogre.

“Excellent,” Dongfang Mu nodded. “I originally considered sending Xiaowu with you...”

His unrelenting matchmaking intentions evident, Guan Yu hastily interjected, “Elder Brother Dongfang, night deepens. I shall take my leave.”

With that, he hurriedly departed with Jiang Ziqi, resembling a fugitive fleeing disgrace.

On the road, Jiang Ziqi teased, “Most would ascend to heaven’s joy becoming Dongfang’s son-in-law. Yet you bolt as if escaping plague?”

Guan Yu rolled his eyes. “If you fancy it, why not volunteer?”

“They’d never consider me!” Jiang Ziqi shuddered at the memory of Dongfang Huowu’s willfulness.

Returning in Dongfang’s ostentatious Bentley, Jiang Ziqi drove it home after dropping Guan Yu off.

Seeing the vehicle, Jiang Shang inquired, “Ziqi, where’s your car?”

After explanations, Jiang Ziqi added, “Father, you’ve heard of the Capital Bureau upheaval?”

Jiang Shang smiled broadly. “Indeed! Many shall lose sleep tonight. Ha!”

“Though direct beneficiaries aren’t us, opportunities abound,” Jiang Ziqi observed. While Wang Dahu’s clan reaped greatest profit from the Bureau’s restructuring, their success stemmed from Guan Yu—now Jiang Ziqi’s sworn brother, binding their fates. Thus, the Jiangs stood to gain immensely.

“Well done!” Jiang Shang praised. “Deepening ties with Guan Yu itself benefits our house tremendously, let alone securing Dongfang’s connection.” His gamble on Guan Yu had proven wise—even if Dongfang’s star waned, this alliance provided invaluable insurance.

Returning home, Guan Yu found not only Patriarchs Wen and Liu present, but also Liu Yunjie waiting purposefully. As Municipal Political-Legal Committee Secretary, the Capital Bureau’s overhaul significantly impacted Liu’s position—now rendered precarious with Wang family dominance over both police and higher political echelons.

Rising upon Guan Yu’s entrance, Liu Yunjie received a curt nod—courtesy extended solely for Liu Yunshu and Wen Qing’s sake.

“Xiao Yu, sit,” Patriarch Wen beckoned. Both elders regarded their granddaughter’s choice with increasing approval. Today’s bold humiliation of the Song clan, following earlier confrontations with Hu and Song heirs, only amplified their admiration for Guan Yu’s fearless capability.

“How fared your Dongfang visit?” Patriarch Wen inquired.

Guan Yu glanced guiltily at Wen Qing. “Well. Elder Brother Dongfang and I became sworn brothers. I met Patriarch Dongfang Jiadi.”

“You met Dongfang Jiadi?!” Wen Baoguo exclaimed.

“Is that remarkable?” Guan Yu puzzled. Though venerable, why such astonishment?

“Remarkable?” Patriarch Liu interjected. “Elder Dongfang surpasses us by a generation. His survival through turbulent eras preserved the clan’s legacy. Wealth rivaling nations, disciples spanning the realm—even provincial governors struggle to gain audience. Yet he received you personally!”

Patriarch Wen beamed. “With Dongfang’s backing, henceforth you may act unimpeded!”

Nodding, Guan Yu resolved to carve his destiny in the capital regardless of external support.

Suddenly, Liu Yunjie blurted, “Guan Yu! I need your help!”

Having exhausted alternatives, the desperate official pleaded: “Introduce me to Vice Minister of Public Security Dongfang Li!”

“Why should I?” Guan Yu reclined, unmoved by familial pretense. “Invoke Qing’s relation? We’re strangers. Aid requires reciprocation.”

Liu Yunjie paled. He’d anticipated compliance through family面子, not this blunt rejection.

“I granted you opportunity before,” Guan Yu reminded. During the Imperial Club affair, Liu’s incompetence had squandered chances with Dongfang Li.

Defeated, Liu Yunjie departed silently, bitterness concealed beneath stern composure.

Patriarch Liu sighed but approved—his son’s shortsightedness required chastening.

Capital matters temporarily settled, Guan Yu prepared for Taiwan. Three days without word from Li Xi kindled worry. Boarding a mainland airline flight alone, he noted the unremarkable attendants before dozing off.

A commotion erupted as a girl tumbled onto him, pursued by a roaring fat man: “Ugly bitch! Dare refuse me? I’ll make you disappear in Taiwan!”

Recognizing the familiar-faced girl pleading “Save me!”, Guan Yu intercepted the assailant’s wrist.

“Release her.”

“Who the hell—” The man’s curse died as agony contorted his features. “Brother! Joke! Mere joke!”

Air police arrived as Guan Yu explained the ‘misunderstanding’, passengers corroborating under his gaze.

After warnings, the cowed bully retreated. The grateful girl stared—her rescuer’s face stirring recognition...

“Sir... thank you.” Her voice trembled with dawning realization.

As Guan Yu studied her features, memories surfaced—where had they met before?
