“To prevent Piao Xu from noticing anything amiss, Guan Yu cooperated by dramatically rolling his eyes while struggling vigorously against the iron restraints. However, he only exerted half his usual strength – who would refuse such a perfect opportunity to recharge energy?

Piao Xu would likely regret this scheme to his core. Guan Yu chuckled inwardly.

Yet when fully charged, Guan Yu would truly have to endure the 22,000-volt current. He maximized his healing system to balance energy consumption and absorption.

The sensation rivaled carnal pleasure, drawing an involuntary moan from Guan Yu.

To Piao Xu, this groan signaled unbearable suffering under icy electrocution. “Haha, Guan Yu! How does it feel?” Piao Xu cackled madly.

“I never imagined...your cruelty...ah!” Guan Yu roared with feigned rage, thrashing chaotically.

“This is mercy compared to what you’ve made me endure,” Piao Xu sneered before ordering, “Increase voltage gradually. Don’t let him die too quickly.”

Technicians doubled the current.

“AARGH!” Guan Yu’s scream pierced the air as overwhelming energy surged through him. Beyond relying on his healing system, he activated gravity enhancement – forty percent weight increase pressed him downward while he mentally rehearsed Bone-Shattering Fist techniques.

Initially manageable, Guan Yu soon flushed crimson with labored breathing. Yet he maintained the strain, testing his limits for potential breakthroughs.

“What the hell?!” Piao Xu exploded, seeing Guan Yu ruddy-faced in -30°C conditions after twenty minutes. “Is this monster immune? Did you screw up the settings?!”

He wheeled on the technician with murderous eyes.

“S-sir, readings show correct parameters!”

“Then why isn’t he dead?!”

“B-bare skin should freeze solid in ten minutes here...plus 400 volts...perhaps death throes? He might collapse any second...”

“Final rally before death? I don’t believe your Chinese superstitions!” Piao Xu snapped. “Open the chamber – I’ll see for myself.”

“But sir, cornered beasts are dangerous—”

“You fear a shackled rat?!” Piao Xu stormed forward with five armed guards.

Bitter cold assaulted them upon entering. “How is he still flushed?!” Piao Xu marveled. All stared at Guan Yu like a freak of nature.

Approaching the chained figure crackling with electricity, Piao Xu gloated, “If I weren’t returning to Korea, I’d prolong this. Remember in your next life – stay beneath your betters.”

As a guard aimed at Guan Yu’s head, the prisoner suddenly roared, releasing gravity suppression while panting heavily.

Piao Xu stayed the execution, sneering, “I thought you’d die stoically. Begging for mercy now?”

Guan Yu strained genuinely against restraints, hearing his death sentence. When Piao Xu leaned close, Guan Yu launched a boot to his chest – conducting live current through the kick.

Piao Xu flew back, clothes smoldering, flesh seared. “KILL HIM!” he shrieked through convulsions.

Five guns leveled as Guan Yu desperately activated gravity manipulation. Gunfire erupted—

Chapter 470: Infinite Tenderness

Guan Yu braced for bullets...yet heard only thuds. Opening his eyes, he saw soldiers subduing the guards.

A haggard face appeared – Wen Qing, eyes red-rimmed. “Husband!” She embraced him, trembling.

“Almost didn’t make it,” Guan Yu smiled weakly as restraints disengaged.

Leading her from the freezer, he donned fresh clothes before confronting the captives. Military officer Tian Xun stated, “Handle them first, then we’ll take over. The old general’s orders.”

“Their sentence?”

“Illegal firearms and attempted murder – ten years.”

Guan Yu crouched by Piao Xu. “Satisfied? Too lenient for scum like you.”

“You...military connections...” Piao Xu spat blood. “I’ll kill you yet!”

A kick doubled him over. “Still capable?” Guan Yu mocked before signaling Tian Xun.

As soldiers removed the prisoners, Wen Qing pouted, “Just one kick?”

Guan Yu obliged with another, knocking Piao Xu unconscious.

Post-adrenaline, Guan Yu noticed enhanced strength – perhaps from extreme training. He almost thanked his tormentor.

Chapter 471: Return to City

Dawn found Guan Yu and Wen Qing entwined in presidential suite sheets, having christened every surface. When afternoon light roused them, Wen Qing traced circles on his chest.

“Time to return. The others in N City must be worried.”

After another passionate delay, they collected a Mercedes from waiting officer Li Xi. En route to retrieve Zhao Jing’er from Zhongnanhai, Wen Qing pinched Guan Yu’s waist.

“That car was her personal gift, wasn’t it?”

“Women’s intuition?”

“Precisely.”

As Guan Yu entered the compound alone, Wen Qing watched Li Xi’s retreating figure, certain of unspoken rivalries kindling. The real drama, she knew, was just beginning.
