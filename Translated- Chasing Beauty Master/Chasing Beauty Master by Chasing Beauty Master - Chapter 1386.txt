“It was Elder Jiu who sent someone to inform me of this news, and I believe the matter cannot be mistaken,” Xuan Ming said. “Elder Jiu has shown great concern regarding this affair and has even discussed it with two other elders. The Eight-Sided Drum Technique involves too many complications, so he instructed us to obtain it before the Demon Sect does.”

Elder Dai stood up and asked, “Sect Leader, I only wish to inquire—how is Elder Xiang now? Are his injuries truly so severe? Previously, he expressed dislike for Guan Yu, but perhaps he might have other suitable candidates in mind.”

Xuan Ming waved his hand dismissively. “Let us set that matter aside for now. Elder Jiu has given me explicit orders, and I must act according to his venerable will. Therefore, I intend to dispatch Lin Chen and Ling Su from Tiger Summit Peak to venture into the desert first. Subsequently, we shall send additional disciples to assist them. What does everyone think of this arrangement?”

The assembly nodded in unison. This time, Elder Zheng remained silent. After Xiao Zhi’s return and hearing of the perils faced during their last expedition to Elder Meng Hua’s underground palace, Elder Zheng had begun to regret his earlier decision. He now wished he had forbidden Xiao Zhi from participating. Had it not been for Guan Yu’s assistance, Xiao Zhi might have lost his life. Without Guan Yu, they likely wouldn’t have even entered Duobao Mountain.

Moreover, this mission involved searching for the elusive Mirage City within the vast desert—a place of extraordinary danger. Though the desert might appear monotonous, its weather was notoriously treacherous, with frequent sandstorms. Without proper protection, one could easily perish.

The deadliest threats were the quicksand traps—natural formations that spelled certain death for any man or beast unfortunate enough to fall into them. Countless other hidden dangers lurked, where a single misstep or moment of carelessness could lead to a swift and silent demise beneath the sands.

Chapter 3593: The Ones Who Will Regret Are Them

Thus, Elder Zheng had no desire to send Xiao Zhi on this mission. Furthermore, he agreed with Elder Dai’s stance—since Elder Xiang had provoked Guan Yu and excluded him from the task, let Elder Xiang’s Left Void Peak disciples attempt it. Let them see if their disciples were truly capable of such a feat.

Even if one could adapt to the desert’s harsh environment and locate Mirage City, the undertaking remained perilous, for Mirage City was notoriously unwelcoming to outsiders.

Xuan Ming continued, “Since the provisions and fresh water a person can carry are limited, survival in the desert cannot be prolonged. Therefore, I propose sending two disciples every two days to search for Mirage City’s location. Following Elder Dai’s suggestion, we shall first dispatch disciples from Left Void Peak. Any objections?”

All shook their heads in agreement. Xuan Ming concluded, “Then the matter is settled.”

Guan Yu had spent the entire day in the back mountains. That evening, as he dined with Elder Jiu and Xiao Dong, the elder remarked, “This morning, I informed Xuan Ming of the news. He has already selected those who will search for Mirage City.”

“Oh? Who has been granted this honor to bring glory to the Cloud Azure Sect?” Guan Yu asked curiously. He marveled at the sect’s urgency, though doubted their chances of success.

The task would prove arduous. If Mirage City proved difficult to locate, prolonged exposure to the desert’s dangers could prove fatal.

Elder Jiu glanced at him. “Lin Chen and Ling Su will lead the vanguard. Every two days, two more disciples will follow, creating a continuous search effort across the desert.”

Guan Yu nodded. “A sound strategy. This ensures constant presence in the desert until the city is found—though I suspect it won’t be easy.” He hesitated before adding, “Who does Master plan to send afterward?”

“During the meeting, Elder Dai suggested seeking Elder Xiang’s input. Ultimately, Xuan Ming decided to deploy Left Void Peak disciples first. This should please you, no?” Elder Jiu remarked.

“Tolerable. It shows Master’s wisdom. Let Left Void Peak’s disciples experience this firsthand. They’ll be the ones regretting it later,” Guan Yu replied.

“You overthink matters. Why concern yourself with others’ opinions? Follow your convictions—I trust you won’t err,” Elder Jiu advised.

Guan Yu found the elder’s unexpected praise puzzling. After being confined for injuring Elder Xiang—a clear warning against overstepping in the Cloud Azure Sect—this sudden approval seemed incongruous.

“I merely wish to cultivate in peace here,” Guan Yu stated. “Other affairs hold little interest. Elder Jiu, may we proceed with charging my Imperial Seal tonight?”

The elder nodded. “After dinner.”

That night, wandering restlessly through the secluded back mountains, Guan Yu felt the isolation keenly. Though not physically confined, the silence weighed heavily—Xiao Dong being mute and Elder Jiu taciturn by nature. Deciding to visit Xiao Zhi at Hanging Central Peak, he slipped through the forest bordering Left Void Peak, careful to avoid detection.

As he neared Left Void Peak’s compounds, he overheard two disciples arguing:

“We can’t defy the Sect Leader’s orders, however dangerous.”

“Why must it always be us? Good assignments never come our way—only life-threatening ones! This is deliberate targeting!”

“During the assembly, the Sect Leader initially wanted Guan Yu for this mission. But after Master fought Guan Yu and got injured—resulting in Guan Yu’s confinement—of course they’d choose our disciples. It’s logical.”

“I refuse! Let them expel me! Better than dying in the desert!”

Guan Yu sneered at their disrespect toward Xuan Ming. Circling around, he inadvertently arrived at the clearing where he’d once met Wang Xiaorong. Memories of their roasted chicken and intimate moments flooded back, when suddenly—

“Who’s there?” He spun to find Wang Jun emerging from the shadows.

Chapter 3594: Coincidence

“Why are you here?” Guan Yu asked, recalling their previous encounter at this spot with Wang Xiaorong.

“Shouldn’t I be?” Wang Jun countered. “I’m here on orders to monitor Demon Sect movements. Or are you meeting our Young Mistress again? Must you always use the same location?”

“This isn’t planned,” Guan Yu protested. “Pure coincidence.”

“Coincidence?” Wang Jun smirked skeptically. “If you’re not waiting for her, perhaps we could talk?”

As they conversed, Wang Jun revealed his background: originally from Blackblood Ridge, forced into service under the Demon Sect after its destruction. Their discussion turned to Guan Yu’s romantic entanglements, particularly with Sect disciple Siqi—a topic interrupted by Wang Xiaorong’s sudden arrival.

“Speaking of devils,” Wang Jun chuckled. “Another ‘coincidence’?”

“We didn’t plan this!” Guan Yu insisted, though Wang Xiaorong gleefully claimed otherwise. After Wang Jun departed, Guan Yu admonished her: “This is dangerous territory for you!”

“I was bored!” she pouted. “No way to contact you in the back mountains. Thought I’d try my luck here. See? We’re fated!”

“Fate had nothing to do with it. I was heading to Hanging Central Peak when I stumbled upon Wang Jun, then you. Multiple coincidences.”

“I don’t care—it’s fate! Stay with me instead!”

As they bantered, Guan Yu grew serious. “You shouldn’t come here. If the elders find you—”

“They won’t! Besides, you’d protect me.”

“What if I hadn’t come? You’re reckless!”

Wang Xiaorong grinned impishly. “But you did come. That’s what matters.”

Guan Yu sighed, caught between concern and affection. The moonlit clearing—once a secret haven—now felt exposed, its tranquility masking the ever-present danger of their forbidden connection.
