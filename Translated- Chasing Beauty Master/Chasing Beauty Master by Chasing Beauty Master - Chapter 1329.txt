Wang Xiaorong leaped up with a beaming smile. "Splendid! Since you have urgent matters these days, I'll wait for you in Qujiang City. Once you finish your business, I'll take you to the Demon Soul Sect myself. So Brother Left Envoy, I can't return with you now. In a few days, I'll come back with Guan Yu. You may report to Father first."

The Left Envoy nodded thoughtfully. This arrangement suited him well. Since the Young Mistress remained unwilling to return, her eventual arrival at the Demon Soul Sect with Guan Yu could prove advantageous. Though the Demon Sovereign had ordered her immediate recall, the Left Envoy would now face no repercussions for delayed compliance. The Young Mistress' promise provided sufficient justification for his report.

"Very well, Young Mistress. Please exercise utmost caution in all matters. I take my leave." With a bow, the Left Envoy departed.

Xiao Zhi remained perplexed. Why would Guan Yu agree to visit the Demon Soul Sect—a veritable dragon's den? Could this indicate genuine defection? Exchanging glances with A'ze, he decided to withhold questions while Wang Xiaorong remained present.

"Hey, our roast ducks are getting cold," A'ze interjected. "Shall we return to eat?"

"Absolutely!" Wang Xiaorong chirped, freed from formal restraints after the envoy's departure. Clinging to Guan Yu's arm, she continued, "Opposite the Soy Sauce Roast Duck shop stands an inn where I'll reside. Once your affairs are settled, come find me here. I'll introduce you to Father."

Guan Yu nodded absently, feeling this arrangement bore uncomfortable resemblance to meeting a prospective father-in-law. The thought conjured memories of women back in Qiaoyuan District—how fared they now? Had the Feng Family overstepped boundaries? What schemes might the Yang Family be brewing?

Unease gnawed at him. When time permitted, he resolved to dispatch Second Only to Wolf for reconnaissance.

Reentering the bustling roast duck establishment, Wang Xiaorong commanded imperiously: "Waiter! Prepare your finest private chamber! Four plump roast ducks with all accompaniments—and make haste!"

Her exuberance temporarily silenced Xiao Zhi and A'ze's misgivings. The aromatic ducks arrived crisped to perfection, their succulent meat thinly sliced and complemented by refreshing side dishes.

"Divine!" Xiao Zhi mumbled through greasy lips, patting his distended belly. "Our thanks for this feast, Miss Wang."

Postprandial, Guan Yu sought departure. Wang Xiaorong pouted: "After gorging yourselves, shouldn't we stroll for digestion?"

"Night approaches," Guan Yu declined. "We must return."

"How cold! No gratitude for the feast, nor willingness to accompany me?" Her cheeks flushed with indignation.

Guan Yu chuckled. "Have you forgotten? Urgent matters demand attention. Would you hinder their completion—and our journey to the Demon Soul Sect?"

Recollection dawned. "True enough. Our stroll must await leisure days."

Post-separation, Guan Yu's trio en route to his uncle's residence finally heard Xiao Zhi's pent-up concern: "Why agree to that viper's nest? You jest about visiting the Demon Soul Sect, surely?"

"Truthfully, I intend to go." Guan Yu's calm declaration stunned them. "As righteous cultivators, we'll inevitably clash with demonic forces. Scouting their stronghold now grants tactical advantage."

"But the peril!" Xiao Zhi protested. "That den permits no allies. You'd be helpless against the Demon Sovereign's whims!"

A'ze concurred: "Demonic cruelty knows no bounds. Alone in their territory, you'd be lamb to slaughter."

Guan Yu had weighed these risks. The Demon Sovereign's true intentions remained obscure—did he still covet the allegedly confiscated magical artifact? Regardless, imprisonment seemed likelier than execution. Wang Xiaorong's protective fervor offered additional safeguard.

"Consider this," Guan Yu reasoned. "The demonic forces already monitor our movements. Had they sought my life, simpler methods sufficed. This invitation implies other designs."

Though unconvinced, Xiao Zhi relented. "May fortune favor you in that accursed place."

**Chapter 3434: Habitual Disobedience**

Meanwhile, City Lord Men perused troubling reports in his study. "Increase patrols," he instructed retainer Zhang. "Recent infiltrators threaten city peace. Detain all suspects."

"Summon my second son," he added irritably. "Rumors of his mischief abound again."

In his chambers, Young Lord Men examined a jade Bagua pendant—unaware of its significance to Red Lotus Sect disciples. The emerald artifact bore intricate crimson veins forming occult patterns.

"Father summons you," a servant announced.

The young lord grumbled, anticipating reprimand. Entering the study, he feigned deference: "You wished to see me, Father?"

City Lord Men glared. "Explain your battered servants! More brawling?"

"Misunderstanding!" the youth protested. "Made friends with an illustrious visitor—Guan Yu from the capital! He gifted this priceless jade." He proffered the Bagua pendant.

The lord inspected the treasure. "Such generosity implies noble lineage. Why refuse his visit?"

"Caution, Father! His background remains unverified—could be assassin."

Pleased by this uncharacteristic prudence, the lord warned: "Stay confined during these troubled times. Infiltrators lurk everywhere."

"Of course, Father." The youth bowed, already planning covert outings. His thoughts drifted to Guan Yu's lavish spending at Echoing Moon Pavilion—and the courtesan Cuihua now beyond his reach.

**Chapter 3436: No Fool's Game**

Meanwhile at his uncle's residence, Guan Yu confronted Second Only to Wolf: "Return to Qiaoyuan. I fear for their safety—especially Zhang Han. The Yangs won't tolerate her treasure-sealed mind indefinitely."

The warrior lounged impassively. "Weeks of travel! Besides, Lady Sakurako's cultivation has soared. They can defend themselves."

"Yang may collaborate with Feng," Guan Yu countered. "Without us, Yu Brotherhood lacks spine against Billen's schemes. Zhang Han's knowledge makes her prime target."

Second Only to Wolf sat up. "Hou Jinshun guards Yang internally. Gamberi's forces patrol externally. Unless..."

"Precisely. If Billen allies with Yang, conventional defenses crumble. Zhang Han's survival hangs on broken memories they covet." His voice hardened. "Yang would rather destroy than share."

The warrior sighed. "Even if I departed now..."

"Better late than never. I must know their status."

As they debated, miles away in Qiaoyuan District, moonlit shadows crept toward unsuspecting households.
