Everyone shared Lao Lang (Old Wolf)’s shock. None had anticipated this young woman could move so swiftly—like a fleeting gust of wind.

Fang Ding harbored the same thought. Had the woman chosen to strike when passing by earlier, Fang Ding would already be dead, utterly defenseless against such speed.

Lao Lang’s face turned ashen. Slowly lowering his spiked club, he forced a smile. “Hahaha! I was just joking around with them. No need to take it so seriously.”

Jones found no humor in his words, especially with the stench of alcohol on his breath. Disgusted, she coldly retorted, “Stay in line, or I won’t hold back!”

Never in his life had Lao Lang been so humiliated by a woman. With dozens of onlookers, his reputation in the martial world would crumble if word spread.

Mocking gazes fueled his rage. Swallowing his fear, he snarled, “You bitch! Think I’m scared? Go ahead—shoot me!” Sweat drenched him despite his bravado.

Though accustomed to dominance, Jones’s boldness gave him pause. Uncertain if her gun was real, he glanced at Guan Yu for cues.

Guan Yu shook his head. “No need to stoop to his level.” Reluctantly, Jones lowered her weapon and retreated to his side.

“You’re Lao Lang, correct?” Guan Yu’s voice remained icy. “You see the situation. Letting you leave would disgrace me before my men.”

Emboldened by Jones’s retreat, Lao Lang sneered, “Screw you! I’m taking Fang with me. What’ll you do about it?” His chest swelled with false triumph.

He’d assumed intimidation would work—until reality struck.

A blur of movement. Agony exploded in Lao Lang’s gut, hurling him backward. His club clattered as he crashed into bystanders.

Jones now stood where he’d been. Lao Lang vomited blood, organs screaming. Only his abundant internal energy kept him conscious.

“I spoke civilly,” Guan Yu remarked coolly. “Your insults earned this lesson.”

Lao Lang tried to retort but coughed more blood. He sat cross-legged, channeling energy to stabilize his raging qi.

Fang Ding watched numbly. Exhaustion and regret weighed on her. She longed to flee, never to face Guan Yu again.

She finally understood: opposing him had been a catastrophic mistake.

Guan Yu’s voice cut through the silence. “Those wishing to leave may go. Except Miss Fang—our business remains unfinished.”

The crowd parted at the entrance. Hesitation hung thick until a bearded man stepped forward. “I’ll take my leave.” Others followed, dispersing into the night.

Twenty minutes later, the warehouse emptied. Only twenty of Lao Lang’s loyalists and Chen Yaofei’s men remained alongside Guan Yu’s faction.

Fang Ding seethed. “You’ve won tonight. Why keep me here? Planning to kidnap me?”

Guan Yu smiled. “Miss Fang, our discussion isn’t over. You initiated this—now it’s my turn.”

“What could we possibly discuss?”

“Considering the commotion you caused,” Guan Yu said, “compensation is due. Five million in cash, perhaps?”

Wei Hongwei and Jia Bo brightened. Their gang’s coffers would swell magnificently.

“This is extortion!” Fang Ding spat.

“Merely a fee for tonight’s…entertainment.” Guan Yu toyed with a recorder. “A theme park charges admission, no?”

Fang Ding’s plan to trade cash for evidence had backfired spectacularly. Trapped, she weighed her options.

“Call the police then! Your gang’s presence here implicates you too!”

Guan Yu smirked. “You’re not leaving without paying.”

Swallowing pride, Fang Ding softened her tone. “Must you detain a helpless woman?”

“Helpless?” Guan Yu laughed. “Helpless women don’t rally hundreds against me. Your ‘helplessness’ cost you dearly.”

**Chapter 2,530: Compensation for Emotional Distress**

“Your family’s reputation hinges on silencing witnesses—a far costlier endeavor,” Guan Yu pressed. “Five million is merciful.”

Defeated, Fang Ding gestured to her car. Two bulging duffel bags of cash soon lay at Guan Yu’s feet.

As Fang Ding sped off, Lao Lang rose unsteadily. “Esteemed Second-Class Expert,” Guan Yu mocked, “will you linger after losing your lady?”

Lao Lang motioned to leave.

“Halt!” Guan Yu’s voice froze them. “You storm in, disrupt my peace, and think to walk free?”

Lao Lang tensed. “What now?”

“Your earlier insults demand recompense.” Guan Yu’s smile chilled. “This isn’t a market—you don’t come and go as you please.”

Clutching his chest, Lao Lang glared, vowing future vengeance—but tonight, he was beaten.
