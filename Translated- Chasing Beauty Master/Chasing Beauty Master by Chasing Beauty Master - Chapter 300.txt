“Haha, that’s right! With you and Guan Yu by my side, I’ll never have to suffer again.” Mo Ling declared matter-of-factly.

Liu Shilei forced a strained smile. Now that Mo Ling knew about her relationship with Guan Yu, she worried Mo Ling might hold a grudge against her.

Though Mo Ling usually seemed carefree, that didn’t mean she lacked attention to detail.

“Shilei-jie, what I said to Jiang Ziqi earlier wasn’t just to provoke him—it was the truth! Now we’re really sisters. I was worried about having no allies to deal with Guan Yu’s other women, but with you here, we can stand strong together. We mustn’t show weakness!”

*Pfft—*

Guan Yu spat out the tea he’d just sipped.

This Mo Ling... full of mischief!

“Is what I said untrue?” Mo Ling rolled her eyes.

Guan Yu could only laugh awkwardly. “Well... actually, it might not be necessary...”

“Why?” Mo Ling puffed her cheeks, hands on hips.

“Among the women we saw at your villa last time, none were connected to you?” Mo Ling retorted sarcastically.

“Uh... How should I put this? Shilei probably wouldn’t face such situations.” Guan Yu struggled to explain.

After all, Liu Shilei had been formally introduced to his parents as his acknowledged partner. Who would dare challenge her position?

“If you only had me and Shilei-jie, sure. But is that possible?” Mo Ling pressed.

Guan Yu realized Mo Ling was subtly hinting at his numerous romantic entanglements. But when fate intervened, what could he do?

He glanced pleadingly at Liu Shilei, who averted her gaze, leaving him to handle this himself.

*Sigh.* After explaining Liu Shilei’s status as his first woman and her move into the villa, Guan Yu nervously awaited Mo Ling’s reaction.

After a tense silence, Mo Ling suddenly laughed uproariously, hugging Liu Shilei: “Yes! Shilei-jie is the rightful first wife. I’ll be her chief ally—we’ll keep the others in line!”

“I want to move into your villa too!” Mo Ling declared.

Guan Yu’s hand trembled—the harem conflict was escalating!

**Chapter 760: New Residence**

As Guan Yu nursed his drink, Lin Dong smoked quietly.

“Xiao Lin, have you considered my proposal?” Guan Yu asked hopefully.

“No way!” Lin Dong refused.

With renovations nearly complete, Guan Yu’s domestic troubles multiplied. Desperate, he tried convincing Lin Dong to move in—hoping male company might curb the women’s antics.

After failed negotiations, Guan宇 resorted to bribes: “I’ll gift you a villa next door!”

Lin Dong saw through the ploy: “No chance of becoming collateral damage in your harem wars!”

Defeated, Guan宇 awaited his fate as manager Wu called—the villa was ready.

**Chapter 761: Strange Harmony**

The SUV arrived at the villa amidst stares. Manager Wu greeted them obsequiously, marveling at Guan Yu’s “harem.”

Dinner passed tensely until Liu Shilei and Mo凌 arrived. Surprisingly, the atmosphere remained peaceful as women conversed amicably.

Later, Du Xiaojuan visited Guan Yu’s room in seductive lingerie, her blushing form illuminated by dim light:

“I... heard men find this appealing...” she whispered shyly.

As Xiaojuan’s silk robe slipped, revealing tantalizing lingerie, the room’s temperature soared—a storm of passion brewing.
