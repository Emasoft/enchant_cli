“Oh? Finally noticed?” Guan Yu’s lips curled into a faintly mocking smile as he faced the incoming black fist. *Cannot engage in close combat? Truth is, I merely wished to avoid staining myself with too much human blood.*

“Second Brother, watch out! Kid, you’re cheating—”

The Golden Core expert who had closed in on Guan Yu had initially worn a savage grin, but his pupils abruptly contracted. He recoiled frantically, as if electrocuted.

“Trying to flee? Too late…”

“Roar—!”

Guan Yu pushed off with his feet, channeling the *Cloud Body Wind Movement* technique. A flash of purple light erupted as his true essence coalesced into the form of a White Tiger, lunging ferociously. Though his body surged forward, the subduing force in his hands clawed backward. The retreating Golden Core expert suddenly felt a terrifying gravitational pull, as though sinking into quicksand.

“Boom—!”

Forced to switch tactics, the man’s fist flared with violet-black light. Their blows collided, but the Golden Core expert staggered backward—only to be yanked forward again after two steps.

“This brat is a monster! Fourth Brother, pin down that sword! I’ll aid Second Brother!”

“Understood!”

The other two Golden Core experts from the Yin Kui Sect sensed the dire turn. Though Second Brother still struggled, anyone could see he was at his limit.

The one called Fourth Brother produced a black talisman. With a flick, it dissolved into smoke, morphing into chains that ensnared Guan Yu’s spiritual sword. Seizing the moment, Fifth Brother erupted from the sword’s range and charged toward Guan Yu and Second Brother.

“Heh. Been waiting for you.” Guan Yu smirked. *If they’d united forces, I might’ve struggled. But arriving piecemeal? This is child’s play.* “A mere Sword-Binding Talisman to shackle my blade? Now that you’re here, your purpose ends. Die.”

He yanked the already battered Second Brother closer, golden light coalescing around his fist—

“Thud—!”

Second Brother vomited a mouthful of blood skyward before collapsing into a boneless heap.

“Second Brother! Brat, you’re dead—”

“Enough prattle. If you’ve the skill, come rend me limb from limb.” Guan Yu scoffed. With a mental command, the chains binding his sword snapped. The blade streaked back into his hand like lightning. He stood sword in hand, sneering at the enraged Demonic Sect expert.

“By my blood, I offer this feast to the Demon God. Gather…!” Just as Guan Yu shattered the second Golden Core expert, the five-man squad’s leader completed his formation. Black mist swirled around his feet, forming concentric crimson patterns. The two slain Golden Core corpses instantly withered into husks.

“Oh? A Blood Sacrifice Ritual. Curious what you’ll summon.” Guan Yu narrowed his eyes, demeanor turning grave yet unshaken. *Demonic summoning is fickle—success hinges on luck, and the summoned abomination often devours its master. Only fools seeking mutual destruction employ this.*

“Ugh—”

Guan Yu shook his hand, inhaling deeply before hurling aside a corpse. When Demonic Sect experts sought mutual annihilation, their explosive power became terrifying. Despite his caution, three strikes had landed. Though he’d seemingly crushed two Golden Core experts, minor injuries lingered.

“Apocalyptic Descent! Demon Sovereign, I offer my soul…” The Golden Core leader’s ritual succeeded. Crimson runes solidified midair as the four corpses below crumbled to dust, scattering on the wind. The blood talisman swelled, the sacrificer himself desiccating into ash. The talisman quivered, burst, and unleashed a scarlet halo. Instantly, a black hole-like void tore open, unleashing a pressure far beyond Golden Core realms.

Under this oppressive might, even Guan Yu’s face paled. Meanwhile, within his consciousness, a bald child spirit bounded excitedly as if celebrating New Year’s.

“Hey, Jin Gang. You’re certain you can handle this summoned thing? I only allowed its summoning because you swore you could.” Guan Yu eyed the demonic aura, regret flickering. *If this bald imp fails, countless will die. The karmic backlash alone…*

**Chapter 1174: Jin Gang’s Terror**

“Hmm… The Spirit-Forsaken Land? Trash. Yet the blood here is plentiful. Half a day’s feast shall suffice…” After moments of churning, a colossal skeleton emerged from the void. Its golden bones crawled with crimson runes sizzling against the world’s suppressive forces.

“This is why I was summoned? A mere Golden Core ant dares summon me, Ming Yuan? Wasteful. Boy, come die.” The skeleton’s joints crackled as it turned toward Guan Yu. Soulfire flickered in its eye sockets, instantly marking him as the target. Crushing spiritual pressure avalanched forth.

*Boom—!*

Guan Yu’s vision darkened, blood seeping from seven orifices. His feet sank inches into the ground as his consciousness teetered on collapse.

“Jin Gang! Hurry! I can’t hold!” Guan Yu’s spirit neared shattering. The skeleton’s mere aura suppressed him utterly—an insurmountable gulf.

“Haha! Done! This one’s trapped, Master! Toss my true form out!” The bald spirit ignored Guan Yu’s plight, fixated on the skeleton’s soulfire like a starved man eyeing a banquet.

*Whoosh—!*

Guan Yu hurled the Demon Subduing Staff. The black rod spun through air, howling. The golden skeleton glanced up dismissively—until radiant light erupted from the staff.

“Oh? You recognize me? A remnant of the Demon Subduing War, no doubt. Perfect.” The light coalesced into a bald figure gripping the staff.

*Hummm—!*

In a blur, the golden skeleton vanished—fleeing at incomprehensible speed.

“Master, watch closely. *This* is how the Demon Subduing Staff is wielded. Hah—!”

The staff blazed gold, expanding to fill heaven and earth in Jin Gang’s grasp.

*Whoosh—!*

The rod’s sweep churned sky and land, golden light enveloping all.

“Ah! Mercy! Gah—!”

The skeleton materialized as if dragged from another dimension. A single strike reduced it to dust. Guan Yu watched Jin Gang devour the lingering soulfire below.

“Damn… *That’s* power?” Guan Yu gaped as the unassuming black staff returned. *A Nascent Soul-level entity obliterated in one strike? Unfathomable.*

“Heh. Special circumstances. The summoning residue masked my presence—otherwise, this world’s restrictions would’ve stifled me. But this harvest? Glorious!” Jin Gang dismissed the feat, his contempt for the skeleton palpable.

“Jin Gang… You’re no mere Immortal Artifact, are you?” Guan Yu’s mind raced. *What if others like him exist?*

“Immortal Artifact? Pah. Those couldn’t endure millennia. I’ve regained some memory fragments, but much remains lost.” The spirit reappeared in Guan Yu’s mind, belly comically bloated.

The sight would’ve amused Guan Yu earlier, but not now—not before such terrifying power.

“Relax. That skeleton was a weakened, two-layered projection from the Netherworld—perfectly countered by me. Now hurry. Your comrades need aid.” Jin Gang deflected, sensing Guan Yu’s unease.

“Whatever you were, you’re Jin Gang—my ally. Since you’ve chosen me, I’ll grow worthy of you.” Guan Yu exhaled, resolve hardening. *One day, even ancient powers will respect me.*

After steadying himself, Guan Yu sped toward the ruins using his *Heavenly Thunder Step* technique, purple light crackling underfoot. Within minutes, he spotted Bao.

**Chapter 1175: Demonic Sect’s Reaction**

The former military king leaned against rubble, seven Demonic Sect Foundation Establishment corpses around him. Blood-drenched yet radiating awe, he relaxed upon seeing Guan Yu.

“Mission done. Hope the others fared well.” Bao grinned, tension dissolving.

“Take these pills. Rest here.” Guan Yu handed him elixirs before checking his GPS—two red dots marked Liao Yun Tian and Lin Dong’s locations.

Elsewhere, a Demonic Sect Foundation Establishment cultivator hissed, “Damned assassin! When I catch you—”

“Hmph. Huddling back-to-back? Amateur.” Perched on a branch, Lin Dong wiped blood from his lips, eyes gleaming predatorily. Six corpses lay strewn under moonlight.

“Lin Dong! On three, finish them. Bao’s injured.” Guan Yu’s voice echoed via transmission.

“One…”

Lin Dong’s dagger twirled like a dancer.

“Two…”

“Three—kill!”

A cultivator lurched forward uncontrollably. “The Golden Core’s back! Agh—!” His neck snapped under Guan Yu’s grip.

“Roar—!” A White Tiger phantom felled two more. The last tried fleeing but froze mid-step—Lin Dong’s blade slit his throat.

“To Liao Yun Tian!”

Meanwhile, Liao Yun Tian faced five encircling foes, missing an arm and bleeding deeply.

“Yun Tian! Strike east! Leave the rest to me!” Guan Yu’s voice cut through his desperation.

The Demonic Sect leader barked, “He’s desperate! Tighten formation!”

But as Liao Yun Tian gathered strength for a final stand, hope arrived.
