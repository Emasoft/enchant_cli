The Demon Sovereign said with a hint of frustration, "But our Demon Soul Sect isn't that powerful. Besides myself, only the Vermilion Bird and the Azure Dragon Left Envoy possess the highest cultivation levels. Compared to the Cloud Azure Sect, our strength falls far short."

The Left Envoy countered, "Sovereign, this isn't absolute truth. Our sect's disciples collectively surpass Cloud Azure's in strength. With numerous allies supporting us, even in direct confrontation, the outcome would remain uncertain."

Indeed, Demon Soul disciples generally attained higher cultivation levels than their Cloud Azure counterparts. The sect imposed no restrictive rules - any disciple progressing swiftly could advance without hindrance, cultivation having no thresholds.

Cloud Azure operated differently. Disciples must first master elementary spells before receiving permission from their masters to learn higher-tier techniques. Each advancement required tedious step-by-step authorization, adhering to their doctrine of "steady foundation over rushed progress." This inevitably slowed their disciples' cultivation pace.

The Demon Sovereign cared not that common spells spread widely through his sect. He considered universal mastery of demonic arts beneficial, knowing none could surpass him while he retained the supreme techniques. Even if exceptional disciples reached advanced stages, they'd naturally seek him for further instruction, thus remaining under his control.

This very philosophy allowed the Demon Soul Sect to expand more effortlessly than Cloud Azure. "Truly," mused the Sovereign, "Cloud Azure guards their techniques like precious jewels. Had they shared knowledge as we do, they'd outstrip us completely. Fortunately, those old fools remain obstinate."

His sect's techniques were incomplete remnants from previous demonic traditions, supplemented by his own creations. Had he obtained Ancestor Menghua's supreme cultivation methods, Cloud Azure wouldn't merit his attention. Heretical methods often surpassed orthodox ones precisely because they defied conventional constraints.

Wang Xiaorong interjected, "Father, isn't now inopportune to seek Miao City? The 'flowering season' should mean summer's peak bloom. Months remain until then. Moreover, Miao City disdains prolonged human stays. Even if found, could we remain?"

"Uncertainty prevails," the Sovereign replied. "Miao City's current existence remains unconfirmed. We must search proactively - discovering it might take months. Should we miss summer's flowering window, we'd wait another year. Rest assured, Cloud Azure won't idle either."

As the Sovereign finished, Sun Zhanglai and White Fox exchanged uneasy glances, hesitating to speak. The Left Envoy suggested, "Sovereign, doesn't Cloud Azure remain ignorant of the 'beneath Golden City' clue? We deduced this from Ancestor Menghua's journals. They likely still puzzle over Miao City's existence."

A cold smile played on the Sovereign's lips. "Underestimate them at your peril. Their ancient elders, centuries-old monsters all, know most secrets. Centuries back, Cloud Azure pursued two wolf demons into Miao City itself. Though suffering casualties there, they certainly remember its existence. Given the Eight-Sided Drum's clues, those fossils will recall Miao City."

"How detestable!" Wang Xiaorong complained. "Must Cloud Azure always know everything before us?"

The Sovereign calmly explained, "The balance holds - we monitor each other's movements equally. I simply avoid direct confrontation while our strength remains inferior. Pointless conflicts would only weaken us."

"Shouldn't we purge Cloud Azure spies from our ranks?" proposed the Left Envoy. "This could safeguard our plans, buying time to locate Miao City first."

"Futile effort," sighed the Sovereign. "Spying between sects persists eternally. Eliminate current informants, new ones emerge. Cloud Azure plants spies in all orthodox sects - Crimson Lotus, True Yang - as do we. Critical secrets' protection depends solely on keeping them from infiltrated higher echelons."

Chapter 3591: Futile Efforts

Steward Sun continued, "Consider this - if the Demon Realm exists in separate plane, so does Miao City. While demons inhabit their realm, Miao City essentially constitutes the Demon Realm."

"So Miao City's unreachable?" asked the Left Envoy. "Is that your meaning?"

Steward Sun shook his head. "Its entrance lies hidden in deserts. Specific methods can locate it, though humans find this extraordinarily difficult."

"The Demon Realm?!" The Sovereign started. "You imply Miao City isn't a city but an entire world? Preposterous!"

"In essence, yes," Steward Sun conceded. "Though its area compares modestly to several Qujiang Cities. Forgive my uncertainty - decades have passed since my last visit."

The Left Envoy pressed, "Old Sun, what method finds Miao City's entrance?"

The Sovereign turned. "Crucially, Miao City's situation proves more complex than imagined?"

Wang Xiaorong interrupted, "Wait! If Miao City isn't in deserts, why associate it with the Golden City?"

Steward Sun explained, "Miao City serves as the Demon Realm's capital. While its desert entrance shifts unpredictably, all portals lead there. During summer's floral zenith, the city materializes in deserts for one day. Humans occasionally witness this, dubbing it 'Golden City' - sunlight by day makes desert sands glitter like gold, while moonlight reveals residual heat patterns resembling golden architecture."

The assembly murmured understanding. The Sovereign marveled, "Without Steward Sun's wisdom, we might have wasted decades searching deserts in vain."

The Left Envoy eyed Steward Sun keenly. "You possess means to reach Miao City, don't you? Having hailed from there with White Fox, you'd best conceal nothing."

Steward Sun sighed. "Our kind forbids bringing humans to the Demon Realm under penalty of familial extermination."

"Extermination?" Wang Xiaorong scoffed. "You've no relatives left. What fear remains?"

"This old bones matters not," Steward Sun gestured to White Fox, "but he's still young. I do know entrance-seeking methods, though their efficacy after decades... uncertain."

The Left Envoy insisted, "No evasions, Old Sun! Share your knowledge!"

White Fox interjected, "Grandfather agonized over this. When you first mentioned seeking Miao City, we knew your efforts futile yet feared consequences. Guiding you constitutes betrayal, making us targets for all demonkind."

Steward Sun concluded, "But keeping silent became unbearable. Having confessed, we'll risk our lives to assist."

The Demon Sovereign patted Steward Sun's shoulder. "Your loyalty is noted. None shall harm you under my protection."

"Then speak!" urged the Left Envoy.

"The method requires no words," Steward Sun revealed. "In deserts, we demons emit aura to attract gatekeepers. However, the Eight-Sided Drum technique can only be obtained when Miao City manifests physically - precisely one day annually. Other attempts prove useless."

Chapter 3592: No Problem

The Sovereign contemplated, "The fifteenth of seventh month - year's peak yin energy. Fitting for the Drum's second volume. But why then?"

White Fox explained, "That day strengthens demonic energies. Many cross between realms, requiring Miao City's physical manifestation for easier transit."

The Left Envoy proposed, "Could we test the entrance-seeking method beforehand? Locate without entering?"

"Feasible," Steward Sun agreed. "But remember - months remain until the fated day. No immediate urgency."

The Sovereign grinned. "Today proves fruitful. Cloud Azure likely remains ignorant - let them exhaust themselves scouring deserts!"

"Old Sun," he commanded, "take White Fox and Left Envoy tomorrow to test your method. Locate but don't enter."

After their departure, Wang Xiaorong whispered, "Father, can we trust these demons?"

"Why doubt?"

"Their tale seems fantastical - a demon realm?"

The Sovereign shrugged. "If demonic planes exist, why not others?" Wang Xiaorong mused silently, already imagining adventures in this strange realm.

At dawn, the trio departed for deserts with ample provisions. "Will your method work, Old Sun?" fretted the Left Envoy. "Desert storms could hinder us."

"It should," Steward Sun replied. "Unless... the gates have shifted these years."

Meanwhile, Cloud Azure's leaders convened at Tiger Head Peak. Sect Leader Xuanming announced, "We've deciphered the Eight-Sided Drum's location - Miao City, appearing in deserts centuries past. Any knowledge?"

Elder Lu nodded. "A demon stronghold. Dangerous for humans."

"Nevertheless," Xuanming insisted, "we must beat the demons there. Any suggestions for the expedition?"

Silence greeted his query - no elder wished to sacrifice disciples. Finally, Xuanming sighed. "Tiger Head Peak disciples will go."

Elder Lu questioned, "How credible is this intelligence?"

Xuanming's answer hung heavily as plans solidified for the perilous desert journey.
