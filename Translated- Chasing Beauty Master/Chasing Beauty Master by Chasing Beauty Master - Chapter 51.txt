“This…” The few underlings following behind Feng Xin were equally perplexed. What matter could be so urgent? They knew this project had long been under Big Sister's watchful eye, eagerly awaiting the other party's negotiations. How could she abandon it at this critical juncture?

Without explanation, Feng Xin went directly downstairs to the finance office. Waving at the accountant, she ordered: “Withdraw 250,000 yuan in cash immediately. Hurry…”

The boss’s command demanded swift action. The finance staff efficiently opened the safe, retrieved operational funds, and packed them in a red canvas tote bag handed to Feng Xin.

About half an hour later, Guan Yu kept checking his phone anxiously when Feng Xin’s car pulled up across the street.

Huff… Watching Feng Xin step out and scan the area for him, Guan Yu’s suspended heart finally settled. Good—he hoped the vendor kept his word about reserving the Bodhisattva statue and censer. Please don’t let them be sold!

Dashing across the street, Guan Yu waved: “Sister Xin, over here…”

Feng Xin turned, spotted Guan Yu, pursed her lips, and slid back into the car.

“Sister Xin… I’m so sorry to trouble you! I’m unfamiliar here and pressed for time, otherwise I’d have come to you. It’s really—”

“Enough nonsense,” Feng Xin cut him off with a sidelong glare.

“Uh…” Guan Yu chuckled awkwardly and fell silent.

“Here’s your money. Explain yourself—why the antique market? Trying to strike rich here?”

“Heh…” Guan Yu smiled noncommittally, then froze upon receiving the bag. “This… it’s too much. 35,000 would suffice. I’ll return the extra 25,000…”

“Keep it. Skipping school to chase money? Take what’s offered!” Feng Xin shot him a withering look.

Cough… Guan Yu stayed mute. Borrowing from the young mistress meant risking extended servitude. With his supernatural abilities, mere thousands meant nothing!

“Use this to repay Liu Jun! Stop wandering where scammers lurk. Think antiques make easy fortune?” Feng Xin snapped, starting the engine.

“Wait! I really must make this purchase!” Guan Yu urgently waved, opening the door.

“Return! You’re forbidden!” Feng Xin pouted, stamping the steering wheel.

Damn… Forbidden? Impossible! After hours searching, this golden chance couldn’t be missed—his ticket to翻身!

“Sister Xin, I know what I’m doing.” Guan Yu exited decisively.

“Get back here! Are you deaf?” Feng Xin smacked the wheel angrily.

Guan Yu inhaled deeply. “I must buy it.”

“Then surrender the money!” Feng Xin countered coldly. This notorious money pit left countless buyers bankrupt with fakes.

Nodding, Guan Yu placed the bag on the passenger seat and left.

“Hey—” Feng Xin called futilely as he crossed toward an ATM.

“Hmph… Such nerve!” She grumbled, following slowly. Only this infuriating man dared treat her thus.

Inside the bank, Guan Yu withdrew his remaining 20,000 savings plus 3,000 lottery winnings—barely 23,000 total.

So be it! 30,000 might secure the censer. If undetected, half-price would suffice.

Seeing Guan Yu exit the ATM, Feng Xin sighed and approached.

“Angry?” She asked softly.

“No…” Guan Yu’s strained smile betrayed him.

“Alright, I worried you’d be cheated. If you insist, consider it tuition.” Feng Xin tugged his sleeve girlishly—uncharacteristic for the gang leader.

Guan Yu jutted his chin. “I’ll repay your 30,000 tomorrow!” With time, lottery earnings could easily cover this.

Feng Xin rolled her eyes. “Get in. What’s this urgent purchase?”

Guan Yu shrugged excitedly. “You’ll see! Hurry!”

Parking at the antique market’s entrance, Feng Xin walked beside Guan Yu instead of linking arms.

“There!” Guan Yu pointed at the vendor’s stall.

The waiting vendor brightened. “Back so soon? Kept them reserved!”

Relieved seeing both items intact, Guan Yu produced cash bundles.

“Count them. If correct, I’ll take them.”

“One moment!” The vendor fetched a counterfeit detector.

After verifying 60,000 yuan, the beaming vendor packaged the goods.

“No need.” Guan Yu cradled the censer like treasure.

Feng Xin examined the Bodhisattva statue. “Six万? Auction records peak at 110,000 pre-tax. Profit doubtful.”

“Sister Xin, you’re expert!”

“Grandfather collects. You’ve bought for收藏, not resale.” She appraised the statue.

Guan Yu grinned at his censer. “Done! Let’s go.”

As they approached the car, an elderly man rushed over. “Young ones! Wait!”

“Us?” Guan Yu pointed at himself.

The breathless man asked: “Did you buy Xu Lao-ba’s Bodhisattva?”

“Yes.” Guan Yu guessed—this must be the 58,000 haggler.

“Marvelous! I’ve coveted it for days. Would you permit inspection? If satisfactory, I’ll double your price!”

Feng Xin gaped. Six万 refused, then twelve万 offered? Madness!

Guan Yu smirked. “Inspect away!” Handing over the statue.

After scrutiny, the old man nodded. “Splendid! I seek such male Bodhisattva for worship. Will you part with it?”

“Ah, the matching censer too?” He added casually.

Guan Yu smiled slyly. “This?”

The man glanced dismissively. “Yes, that freebie. Let me see…”

“Sir, take the statue for 50,000 now. The censer stays.” Guan Yu raised an eyebrow.

The old man started, then chuckled sheepishly. Both shared knowing smiles.

Rubbing his forehead, the elder sighed: “Foiled! Let me examine it properly.”

Guan Yu handed over the censer. The man studied its base intently, wiping grime to reveal purple-red patina.

“Marvelous eye, young man! This Xuande censer—I hesitated days, fearing the vendor might notice. The statue’s worth 40-50k, but this… a treasure!”

Guan Yu remained silent, impressed.

“Xu Lao-ba’s loss! Unpolished, its true worth hid. This Xuande censer—easily a million!”

Feng欣’s eyes widened. A million?!

“Authentic Xuande censer?” She gasped.

“Undoubtedly! I own one. Young man, will you sell?”

Guan Yu’s eyes lit up. “Name your price.”

“Current auction trends—1.1 million?”

Guan Yu nearly choked—double his estimated 500k!

“Deal!” He accepted instantly.

At the bank, 1.1 million transferred, Guan Yu beamed. “Pleasure doing business!”

Emerging millionaire, Guan Yu offered the elder a ride home.

“Guan Yu, was it? Remarkable discernment. Veteran collector?”

“Beginner’s luck,” Guan Yu demurred.
