Pan Xiaoxia gasped heavily, her entire body heaving with each labored breath. Wheezing, she said, “I’m fine… just exhausted… Hurry… fetch water for Guan Yu… Go quickly…”

“Alright, rest for now.” Pan Taisheng jogged to the living room coffee table, picked up a thermos of cooled boiled water prepared for Jin Hua, grabbed a cup, and returned to the south bedroom.

Propping Guan Yu’s upper body against his own, he carefully spooned water into the young man’s mouth. Pan Xiaoxia appeared on the verge of collapse, but as a cultivator of considerable skill, she had regained some strength through forced recovery.

Pan Taisheng asked curiously, “Why do they both need so much water? They’re drinking like they’ve crossed a desert.”

“Because they… were scorched by fire.” The words emerged between Pan Xiaoxia’s panting breaths.

“Fire? Impossible!” Pan Taisheng stared at the unblemished skin of the two patients. “There’s not a single burn mark!”

Pan Xiaoxia fell silent. Explaining cultivation matters to this mortal would be like talking to a brick wall. Guan Yu drank voraciously, draining the entire thermos. Pan Taisheng eyed the empty container. “Xiaoxia, should I boil more?”

After checking Guan Yu’s pulse and channeling a thread of internal energy through his meridians, Pan Xiaoxia nodded in relief. “No need. He’s stable now. His recovery speed is… remarkable.” She paused. “Did you call my workplace?”

Pan Taisheng froze. “Ah! It slipped my mind amidst the chaos—”

“Forget it.” She waved weakly. “Boil more water instead. I’ll handle the call.”

The healing session had drained her vital energy, requiring days of rest. What troubled her more was Guan Yu’s internal landscape—tissue resembling charred meat, yet somehow sustaining life. Stranger still was the impenetrable barrier near his skull, defying her probing energy. Without her intervention, the young man would have surely met Yama.

A cough interrupted their conversation. Guan Yu’s eyelids fluttered open, mirroring Jin Hua’s feeble awakening from days prior. Thanks to Pan Taisheng’s foresight in preparing broth and congee, the patient managed sustenance.

By evening, Guan Yu could shuffle about supported—his recovery outpacing Jin Hua’s by twofold despite severe qi depletion. Pan Xiaoxia cautioned, “Your cultivation…”

Guan Yu raised a trembling hand. “I know. The dantian’s shattered. But the foundation remains. It’ll return.”

The lie tasted bitter. His energy sea lay desolate, whether drained by the cranial seal or consumed by phantom flames mattered not. Saving Jin Hua had been worth the cost. “Thank you both,” he said with uncharacteristic solemnity.

Pan Taisheng chuckled awkwardly. “Brothers don’t keep score. Just buy me drinks when you’re healed.”

“The King of Hell must’ve feared for Qiaoyuan’s widows,” Pan Taisheng joked later as he helped Guan Yu visit Jin Hua. The girl lay wan but alive, her hand trembling in Guan Yu’s grip. A futile attempt to channel qi reminded him of his loss.

“This is my fault,” Jin Hua wept. “The incantation—”

“Hush.” Guan Yu smoothed her hair. “All’s well now.”

But behind the calm facade raged turmoil. Where had his cultivation vanished? The mystery gnawed as Pan siblings discreetly exited.

Outside, Pan Xiaoxia confirmed her brother’s suspicion. “No qi sea remains. Yet his mind… protected by something even my energy cannot breach.”

“Leave the riddles,” Pan Taisheng grumbled. “He’s alive—that’s enough.”

Days later, Guan Yu returned to Qiaoyuan District, bracing for fury. Two hundred missed calls glared from his phone. Wisely, he’d phoned every woman except Xue Jing—the fiery-tempered one now greeted him with frosty silence.

“You’ve lost weight!” Ah Mei fretted, while others noted his gaunt pallor. Only keen observers sensed the deeper change—the void where formidable energy once thrummed.

In the gaming den-turned-computer lab, Lan Yu had joined Zhang Han’s clique. The real storm arrived with Lin Qiaoqiao that evening. “The new deputy commissioner wants me replaced!” the police captain fumed. “Says women lack grit for investigations.”

Yang Conghan’s intelligence identified the appointee—Tian Niu, a political transplant aiming to purge departments. Guan Yu’s counterstrike unfolded through midnight raids—gambling dens, counterfeit drug rings, illicit nightclubs—orchestrated via informant tips.

By dawn, twenty arrests later, Commissioner Tian’s bluster evaporated under Lin Qiaoqiao’s medal-winning spree. Yet the victory bred new enemies—none more dangerous than Shen Fangcheng, whose underground empire had suffered greatly.

As Shen ranted in his marble factory office, Guan Yu faced domestic tensions. Xue Jing’s silent treatment and Ah Mei’s tender care formed the calm before storms yet brewing—both in Qiaoyuan’s winding streets and the cultivator’s hollowed core.
