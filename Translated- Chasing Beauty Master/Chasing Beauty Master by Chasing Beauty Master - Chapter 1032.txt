“Oh, I blacked out drinking last night. I just wanted to make sure you were okay.” Second Only to Wolf hung up and stumbled back to his room, resuming his thunderous snoring.

Guan Yu felt thoroughly exasperated. Thank goodness this wasn't a real bodyguard assignment—if things kept up like this, he’d develop chronic frustration. After waking, neither Guan Yu nor Golden Flower felt drowsy anymore.

Guan Yu picked up his phone to set up timed messages again. He still needed to send promised updates to Xue Jing, though hourly notifications proved cumbersome. Using a scheduling app, he automated the texts.

This way, Xue Jing would know he was safe without constant worry, allowing Guan Yu to extend his stay at Golden Flower’s place.

Better to avoid forgetting messages and triggering Xue Jing’s temper.

Originally planning to linger until the Yang Family auction, Guan Yu’s phone rang—Jones’ caller ID flashing. He knew trouble brewed.

“Guan Yu, we’re nearly assembled. I heard Bill Lin’s returning to the Bill Family today. This might be our window,” Jones said over the line.

Earlier, Guan Yu had instructed Jones to prepare maximum forces for striking the Feng Family decisively when the moment came.

Jones complied. Intel from Lou Lu, their mole in Feng’s security detail, confirmed Bill Lin’s imminent departure.

“Is the intel solid? Any word on why Bill Lin’s leaving?” Guan Yu asked warily, suspecting a trap.

“Rumors say it’s his birthday celebration. He’s likely heading home for festivities.” Jones paused. “My sources report Bill Lin recently allied with several parties planning moves against you soon. Feng’s keeping specifics airtight.”

“Even ironclad secrets leak. Dig deeper into Feng’s circle—bribe Bill Lin’s men if necessary,” Guan Yu ordered.

“Tried that. During Feng’s council meetings, even janitors get expelled. Attendees wear masks and hats under heavy guard. Gathering intel’s nearly impossible,” Jones explained.

“Find alternative methods. Monitor Fang Su and Ge Yinglai’s recent movements,” Guan Yu strategized. If Bill Lin sought allies against him, these longtime rivals topped the list—though the Yang Family seemed unlikely collaborators despite tensions.

“With Bill Lin absent, Feng’s defenses are weakest. Should we strike now?” Jones pressed.

“Hold position. Wait for my signal.” Guan Yu hung up, unwilling to charge blindly into potential ambushes.

Yet the opportunity to cripple Feng proved irresistible. Contacting Wei Hongwei yielded no response. Guan Yu dialed Jia Bo instead: “Where’s Hongwei? His phone’s dead.”

Jia Bo stammered, “No clue. Probably glued to Yao Yao?”

“I warned everyone to stay alert! That fool can’t even keep his phone on,” Guan Yu snapped coldly.

“I’ll track down that bastard immediately!” Jia Bo vowed.

“Forget it. How many Yu Gang members can mobilize for combat? Those ready to wield weapons,” Guan Yu redirected.

“Reporting, Boss: 394 total members. 360 combat-ready. Over 300 available on call,” Jia Bo answered.

Satisfied given recent internal reforms without recruitment, Guan Yu praised, “Not bad. What about vehicles?”

“Bought thirty. Even with full deployment, ten remain spare. Never repeating the Temple of Posterior Edge shortage,” Jia Bo confirmed.

When Guan Yu approved Jia Bo’s proposal to purchase their current headquarters from municipal authorities for permanent base development, he cautioned, “Good idea, but proceed slowly. I’ll contact connections first.”

After arranging standby orders, Guan Yu reflected on Wei Hongwei and Jia Bo’s transformation—once timid students turned gang lieutenants, now swaggering through A City with heads held high. Their BMW 5 Series sedans, though modest by underworld standards, symbolized unimaginable status leaps.

Meanwhile, Wei Hongwei surfaced at the Temple of Posterior Edge delivering three new Audis to the monk allies Shengsheng, Dahuzi, and Xiaobai. “Uncles, how’s the ride?” he asked proudly.

Shengsheng chuckled, “Brother Guan’s too generous. But we’ll gladly accept to aid his future endeavors.”

When Guan Yu called to berate Wei Hongwei’s dead phone, the chastened lieutenant rushed back, charging his device and mobilizing forces.

Returning to Qiaoyuan District, Guan Yu found Second Only to Wolf blocked by Yoko at their doorstep. “No entry until you wash! You’ll ruin the new couch!” she scolded.

Laughing, Second Only to Wolf declined, “No offense taken, sis. I’ll return filthier next time to torment your castle properly!”

As his muddy jeep departed, Yoko fretted until Guan Yu reassured her. Preparations complete, all awaited nightfall’s strike—a gamble where vigilance against Bill Lin’s schemes meant survival.
