Master Jiushi glanced at Guanyu with a faint smile. “You rascal, don’t presume to guess my thoughts. Those are your own speculations, not mine. Even if I still hold Miss Yezi in my heart, it concerns her life-saving grace. I am a man who repays kindness. Is it not natural to remember one who saved my life?”

“I never implied anything else!” Guanyu hurriedly clarified. “I know you cherish Miss Yezi’s memory, and of course I understand it stems from gratitude. There’s no contradiction here. I never suggested otherwise.”

Observing Master Jiushi’s calm expression, Guanyu pressed on. “But Master, have you truly never wished to find Miss Yezi and express your thanks? Were I in your place, I certainly would.”

“What difference would it make?” Master Jiushi sighed. “We inhabit separate worlds. Meeting again would be immensely difficult. I dwell here while she resides elsewhere. Even if I wished to seek her, the path is treacherous.”

Guanyu discerned the unspoken longing beneath his mentor’s words. Two decades had passed since Yezi vanished into the desert’s shifting sands. Her features would have weathered time’s passage, rendering recognition uncertain even if fate allowed reunion.

“Master, my homeland lies in that realm. With modern technology and networks, locating someone isn’t impossible. Given basic information, we could—“

“Your world differs entirely,” Master Jiushi interjected. “Here, we rely on word-of-mouth and posted notices. Endless wandering might yield nothing in a lifetime. But your realm...” He trailed off, unfamiliar with the concept of digital searches.

Seizing the opening, Guanyu proposed, “Let me help. Describe Miss Yezi’s features or her dwelling place. Even fragments could aid the search.”

The old cultivator’s resolve wavered. From his robes emerged a worn satchel. Within lay a faded color photograph – a technological marvel incomprehensible in this world. “She called this a ‘photo’,” he murmured, handing over the image. “The artist captured her likeness perfectly.”

Guanyu chuckled. “This isn’t painted – it’s produced by machinery.” The photo revealed a young woman perched on a park bench, her smile etching dimples in cheeks. Though styled in outdated fashion, her beauty transcended eras. “No wonder she lingers in your memory,” Guanyu remarked. “A rare beauty even by today’s standards.”

“Mock your elder?” Master Jiushi feigned offense.

“Never!” Guanyu raised placating hands. “I marvel at your fortune – even life-saving angels manifest as lovelies. But seriously, with this photo and a full name—“

“Only ‘Yezi’ remains. She hailed from Lianzhou City.” Master Jiushi’s fingers traced the photograph’s edges. “Twenty winters have passed. She may be grandmother now, face lined with years.”

Guanyu’s enthusiasm dimmed. “Master... perhaps this quest is unwise. Finding her current self might bring disappointment.”

The old cultivator’s eyes hardened. “You think me shallow? My gratitude transcends appearances. Moreover—“ He hesitated. “When convalescing at her home, I... taught her basic cultivation techniques. If she pursued the path, time’s mark would be light.”

Guanyu brightened. “This changes everything! Cultivators age slowly. With this clue and the photo—“

“You’d truly undertake this?” Suspicion edged Master Jiushi’s voice. “What favor seeks repayment?”

“Merely access to your restricted library,” Guanyu grinned.

“Never!” The rebuke came swift. “My study remains forbidden. Attempt intrusion and I’ll have Sect Leader Xuanming discipline you personally!”

As their debate continued, Guanyu’s mind raced. The library’s secrets called him, but darker thoughts surfaced – perhaps fire might breach its barriers. Yet Master Jiushi watched keenly, attuned to his disciple’s scheming. The old cultivator’s study would yield its mysteries only through guile, not force.
