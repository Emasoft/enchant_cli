Gao Wei grew anxious, her voice rising slightly. "Guan Yu."

Guan Yu opened his eyes. "I'm here."

Hearing his response, Gao Wei's heart settled. "Are you cold?"

"Freezing," Guan Yu answered truthfully.

After a long silence, Gao Wei spoke again. "You should come up here."

"Alright." Guan Yu didn't refuse. Who'd choose a chair over a bed with quilts in this bitter cold without heating? Though the healing system could help, that required energy. Following his frugal principles, he wrapped himself in the quilt and groped his way to the bed in the dark, lying down carefully.

Now they shared a single bed beneath two separate quilts.

"Goodnight," Gao Wei whispered as Guan Yu settled in, clutching her quilt tightly before closing her eyes.

"Goodnight," Guan Yu murmured back.

The next morning, elderly parkgoers' chatter during morning exercises roused Guan Yu and Gao Wei simultaneously.

Guan Yu saw Gao Wei's haggard face, while she took in his refreshed appearance.

"You slept well," Gao Wei remarked, her delicate nose wrinkling slightly.

After last night's events, tangled thoughts had kept her awake until dawn. Seeing Guan Yu's energetic demeanor now filled her with both embarrassment and irritation—embarrassment over their earlier intimate entanglement, and annoyance that he'd apparently slept soundly because of it.

"Not bad," Guan Yu feigned ignorance of her displeasure.

"Why did you have an extra quilt?" Gao Wei asked, eyeing their separate covers with mixed emotions.

"The landlady brought it yesterday. Didn't you know?"

"Then why didn't you use it when first getting in bed?" Gao Wei's voice edged toward explosion. "Pervert! Lecher!"

Guan Yu froze, realizing her implication—had he used the second quilt immediately, they wouldn't have ended up in that compromising position with her on top. She clearly thought he'd planned this.

"But you told me to come up," Guan Yu protested weakly.

"I meant for you to sleep properly! Why hide the extra quilt?" Gao Wei remained unconvinced.

"I was standing there in just shorts. When you said to come up, I didn't think about anything else." Guan Yu scratched his head sheepishly. "Besides... I thought you wanted to share warmth under one quilt."

"Share warmth? What nonsense!" Gao Wei's temper flared, though she restrained herself from yesterday's impulsiveness. "You're all lust and no courage, pushing responsibility onto me! Are you even a real man?"

Her accusations escalated. "You took all the advantages then act innocent! Scoundrel! Lecher! Pervert!"

Guan Yu rubbed his neck awkwardly. Having seen and touched more than proper—though stopping short of actual intimacy—he let her vent.

The tense atmosphere shattered when door noises announced the landlady's arrival. A middle-aged woman called through the door: "Young man, are you awake?"

"We're up," Guan Yu answered.

"I bought clothes. Someone come get them."

"Should I go or..." Guan Yu began, then mentally kicked himself. Wrapping himself in the quilt, he cracked the door open to accept two shopping bags. "Thank you, ma'am."

"Don't mention it." The woman waved. "I should thank you."

Guan Yu shook his head meaningfully. "No, thank you truly." He didn't explain that her shabby, unheated room had facilitated this unexpected intimacy.

"Stop grinning and get dressed," the woman chided. "Leaving your girl naked in bed? Young folks should still mind their health after... exertions last night." She handed over breakfast before leaving.

Guan Yu choked back explanations. Returning inside, he tossed Gao Wei's clothes onto the bed—plain, unbranded garments, though including serviceable underthings. "Try these."

Blushing furiously after overhearing the conversation, Gao Wei nodded. When Guan Yu lingered, she glared. "Planning to watch me change?"

"Uh... I'll check the breakfast." Guan Yu beat a hasty retreat.

When Gao Wei finally emerged, Guan Yu's breath caught. The yellow fitted jacket, black slacks, and sneakers transformed the glamorous star into a fresh-faced college girl. Her natural beauty shone through regardless of attire.

They soon departed, Gao Wei exhaling in relief once safely distant. "Feels good not being recognized."

"I get it." Guan Yu understood a celebrity's need for privacy. But their parting carried melancholy—after last night's closeness, their farewell felt abruptly casual.

Drifting aimlessly, Guan Yu suddenly decided to visit his long-neglected university. Approaching his classroom, he heard a man's booming shouts:

"Who put this water bucket over the door? Step forward now! Silent? Think the new Dean of Education is easy prey? I'll show you what discipline means!"

"New dean?" Guan Yu wondered, entering to see a drenched, fish-adorned man raging before snickering students. A goldfish miraculously balanced on his gelled combover, leaping rhythmically like an aquatic gymnast.

"Enough!" The dean crushed the fish underfoot, silencing the class with his brutality.

"This is our new dean?" someone muttered. "No compassion even for a fish."

"He's got violent tendencies! We demand a different teacher!"

The dean slammed a chalkboard eraser, roaring: "Silence! How did riffraff like you enter university?"

"Same way a toad like you became dean?" came a familiar retort—Wang Zhen, Guan Yu's friend, leaning casually by the door.

As chaos erupted, Guan Yu watched the goldfish's final, tragic act—a symbol of resistance against heavy-handed authority.
