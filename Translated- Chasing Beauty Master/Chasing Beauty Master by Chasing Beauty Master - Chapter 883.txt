Aunt Qing suffered from numerous ailments—diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and a herniated disc. She required daily medication to manage her conditions, particularly the spinal issue that demanded careful rest. Excessive movement could severely worsen her state, which was why Ling’er remained adamant about returning home to care for her parents.

Aunt Qing believed Ling’er would live a blessed life if she stayed with Guan Yu. “Mom, I won’t listen to anything you say today. I must go back,” insisted Ling’er, her filial nature clashing with her resolve.

“Ling’er, listen to me. This is for your own good. Even if you return, will your father’s condition improve? Your parents will only worry more about your future,” Aunt Qing pleaded.

Guan Yu understood Ling’er’s intentions—whether cooking three meals daily or分担家务, she wanted to ease her parents’ burdens. But how long would this sacrifice last? If Uncle Qing’s health lingered in limbo for years, Ling’er’s youth would slip away. At twenty, delaying marriage concerned Aunt Qing deeply.

Guan Yu recognized the unspoken fear: Aunt Qing didn’t distrust Ling’er’s capabilities but feared stalling her daughter’s prospects.

“Ling’er, stay with us. Everyone here will treat you kindly, and we’ll arrange care for your parents,” Xue Jing interjected calmly, her support comforting Guan Yu.

Xue Jing had always stood steadfastly by Guan Yu, asking nothing in return. He reflected on owing her greater kindness. When he had lost his memory, only Xue Jing remained, accompanying him through his darkest days. Once a temperamental heiress, she had transformed into a devoted caretaker—cooking, cleaning, and nurturing without complaint.

She sought no guarantees of his affection, content simply to hold a place in his heart. Over time, she had mothered him through every recklessness, smoothing each fallout.

“Enough,” Guan Yu sighed. “Ling’er has her wishes. Let’s all act according to our hearts.” He turned to Ling’er. “You’ll always be my sister. Qiaoyuan District’s doors remain open whenever you wish to return.”

“Thank you, Brother Guan. I… I do want to stay, but could you give me time? I need to see Father,” Ling’er replied.

“Of course. Come and go as you please. As Xue Jing said, we’ll send help for your parents,” Guan Yu assured.

Aunt Qing reluctantly relented. Just then, A Mei arrived, cheerfully inquiring, “Where did Hanhan and Lü Mei go? Lunch is ready!”

“They might dine out today,” Guan Yu answered.

“What a pity! I made all Hanhan’s favorites. Well, Auntie and Ling’er must join us!” A Mei insisted.

“Yes, let’s eat together,” Xue Jing urged.

Aunt Qing demurred, embarrassed by their hospitality, but Guan Yu pressed, “Stay. After the meal, Xue Jing will drive you home.”

As dishes filled the table in Guan Yu’s room, the group gathered. These days, meals were often served here, with Zhang Han playfully insisting on feeding Guan Yu like a “good baby,” much to his exasperation.

Over lunch, Guan Yu inquired about Uncle Qing’s worsening condition. Aunt Qing explained, “The snake venom relapsed terribly. Two gallbladders did nothing. He’s been unconscious for days.”

Guan Yu deduced the crisis stemmed from Uncle Qing overexerting his internal energy during a fight with his martial sister—the true culprit. That night, the sister and her accomplice, First-Class Master Ma He, had ambushed him. Only Guan Yu and Qiong Si’s timely intervention saved his life.

“Why did you suspect the attack?” Aunt Qing asked.

“After the sister fled injured, I had Qiong Si monitor your home,” Guan Yu revealed.

Gratefully, Aunt Qing sighed, “We’ve burdened you too much.”

“Fate brought us together. Helping is natural,” Guan Yu replied, squeezing her weathered hand.

Post-meal, Xue Jing drove the母女 home. Guan Yu later visited Jin Hua, who had anxiously awaited news during his recovery.

“You’ve lost weight,” he remarked, noting her pallor.

“Worry dried my lips,” she admitted, applying gloss.

Their conversation turned to the Feng family’s trap. Guan Yu recounted narrowly escaping Feng Xi Hu’s cunning plot with her help, disguised as a guard.

As dusk fell, Jin Hua nestled into his arms, content despite the looming shadows over Uncle Qing’s survival and the unresolved threats ahead.
