However, Li Xi (Dawn) excelled in her erect and perky posture, and her bust was flawlessly proportioned, embodying the golden ratio!

In this aspect, both women possessed their own distinct charms.

“Guan Yu (Cosmos) would never fancy someone like me!” Lin Lin (Forest Jade) pursed her lips. “But Xi Xi, I’ve noticed your… assets have grown quite a bit lately. Tell me, is it because of Guan Yu?”

As she spoke, Lin Lin playfully grabbed Li Xi’s proud curves.

“My, so soft! Xi Xi, are you not wearing a bra?”

Caught off guard by this boldness, Li Xi flushed with a mix of embarrassment and indignation. She retaliated, “You’re the one going braless! Let me check!”

Lin Lin fought back with equal vigor.

Instantly, the room brimmed with amorous energy.

In the office of The Magnate Club’s automotive division, Li Yu (Bright Flame)—who should have been seated behind his desk—stood deferentially before the young military-uniformed man.

“Young Master Deng, we implore your assistance to help The Magnate survive this crisis!”

“Boss Li…” The young man sighed. “The troubles facing your organization surpass even my capacity to resolve completely.”

Li Yu’s heart chilled. “Is Guan Yu’s background truly formidable?”

“His personal influence is negligible, but the women behind him…” Young Master Deng’s tone sharpened. “Li Xi alone could bury you ten times over. Kidnapping her was idiocy. Countless elites among her suitors rival my own stature. I’ve no idea how Guan Yu tamed this famously aloof ice queen of the capital.”

His words dripped with undisguised envy. To him, Guan Yu embodied the ultimate gigolo—surrounded by stunning, influential women whose combined power shook the city.

“Moreover,” the young man continued, “Guan Yu has somehow persuaded Jiang Ziqí (Son Chess) to move against you. Tread carefully.”

Li Yu stiffened. “Jiang Ziqí demands The Magnate’s dissolution and my exile from the capital. What counsel do you offer?”

“Comply.” Young Master Deng waved dismissively. “Your organization has plateaued. Use this as an opportunity to rebuild anew. With your talents, you’ll resurrect an empire surpassing this.”

Li Yu remained silent, recognizing the veiled ambition beneath these honeyed words—this “rebirth” would make him a puppet ruler under Deng’s control. Yet refusal meant facing annihilation by Guan Yu, Jiang Ziqí, and Deng himself.

Noticing Li Yu’s hesitation, Deng added smoothly, “Rest assured—any new enterprise will remain wholly yours. My position forbids overt associations.”

“My gratitude, Young Master.” Li Yu clenched his teeth.

Deng smiled, knowing his objective was secured.

……

Guan Yu never anticipated walking into such an erotic tableau upon entering Li Xi’s room.

The two women tussled amidst tangled sheets, their intimate red and pink lingerie glaringly visible. His eyes locked onto the flash of white peeking beneath Li Xi’s rumpled skirt—

“Guan Yu! Who said you could enter?!”

Li Xi hastily yanked the blanket over herself while Lin Lin casually straightened her clothes. “I’ll leave you lovebirds alone!” she giggled.

“I’ll escort you out!” Li Xi glared at Guan Yu, unwilling to be left alone with him yet unable to rise modestly. “Why are you still here?!”

“Where else would I go?” Guan Yu lounged on the sofa. “I live here now. Besides…” He grinned roguishly. “We’re practically cohabitants already!”

As Lin Lin tactfully exited, Guan Yu approved, “Now that’s wisdom!”

Left alone, tension crackled between them. Li Xi’s usual composure shattered into furious glares, while Guan Yu’s imagination ran wild beneath the concealing blanket—

If only his superpower included X-ray vision!

“Get out! I need to change!”

“Change away. I won’t peek.”

Enraged, Li Xi lunged from bed—only to trip and crash into him. Their lips met mid-fall.

Time froze for Li Xi as Guan Yu seized the opportunity, deepening the kiss with skilled urgency. His hands wandered—

So full. So exquisite.

He marveled at conquering the capital’s most coveted ice princess. But triumph morphed into agony when her knee slammed his crotch.

“You—!” He doubled over, wheezing. “Trying to castrate your future husband?!”

“Who’d marry you?!” Crimson-faced, Li Xi changed subjects. “When are we leaving for Taiwan?”

Guan Yu grimaced. “Day after tomorrow. Wan Qianshan (Thousand Mountains) thinks he can test me? I’ll show him true control.”

News of The Magnate’s dissolution soon reached Li Xi, leaving her awestruck. Countless powerhouses had failed to topple that empire—yet Guan Yu erased it with a word. Each layer she peeled from him revealed deeper mysteries, both thrilling and terrifying.

Meanwhile, the capital’s elite erupted into frenzy. Underworld vultures circled The Magnate’s carcass while political clans recalculated balances.

At the Jiang residence, Jiang Ziqí faced his father Jiang Shang (Esteemed)—a decorated general.

“Explain your actions against The Magnate.”

“Father, eliminating a future rival preemptively is strategic. The underworld remains a necessary evil—better controlled by our own proxies.”

Jiang Shang nodded slowly. “And Guan Yu?”

“…An associate.”

“Associate?” The general’s gaze pierced through him. “True strength lies not in inherited power, but self-made ascent. That boy climbed from nothing—a force you’d do well to befriend, not antagonize.”

……

Back at Li Xi’s villa, Guan Yu’s phone rang—Wen Qing (Warm Affection)’s name flashing.

“Darling! How could I forget you?” He oozed false charm.

“Liar. You’re with her, aren’t you?” Wen Qing’s voice chilled. “Don’t bother coming. I’m at a blind date!”

The dial tone ignited his fury. “Who dares poach my woman?!”

As Guan Yu stormed out, Li Xi unexpectedly called, “Take me shopping. Now.”

“Now? It’s nearly dark!”

“Now.”

Her uncharacteristic demand gave him pause—and the first glimpse of vulnerability beneath her icy veneer.
