After much contemplation, Guan Yu proposed a solution, “Sister Siqi, here’s an idea. I’ll keep the Jade Ruyi safe for now. When you return, inform Headmistress Dai that I intend to gift this artifact to you. Have her personally accompany you here to retrieve it. That would ensure greater security.”

If Headmistress Dai learned Guan Yu wished to bestow the Jade Ruyi upon Siqi, she would rush over immediately. For her beloved disciple to obtain such a magical artifact would be an immense blessing. Though Headmistress Dai herself coveted the treasure, seeing her favorite pupil acquire it would still bring her profound joy.

“Agreed,” Siqi nodded. “I’ll inform my master first thing tomorrow morning. She’ll surely be delighted.” Yet Guan Yu grew uneasy again. For Headmistress Dai to visit, she would need permission from Sect Leader Xuanming—a cumbersome process. Still, no better alternative existed. He trusted the headmistress would prioritize this matter once informed.

Retrieving the jade artifact, Guan Yu said, “Very well. Night deepens—we should part here. I’ll await you tomorrow.” As Siqi nodded with trembling anticipation, Guan Yu turned toward the Ancestral Hall.

Walking back, Siqi’s heart fluttered like caged birds. Sleep would elude her tonight. A high-grade magical artifact! Such treasures existed beyond her wildest dreams—she’d considered herself fortunate to someday own common talismans. That Guan Yu would gift her the Jade Ruyi felt unreal.

The standard Cloud Azure Swords issued to disciples barely qualified as magical tools. Their sole distinction lay in the faintly glowing gemstones embedded in their hilts—crude vessels holding minuscule spiritual energy, marginally useful during spellcasting.

These were inferior even to low-grade artifacts. Ordinary disciples could only obtain proper tools through rare opportunities or by crafting their own from precious materials. High-grade artifacts remained jealously guarded by sect elders, cherished more than life itself.

When Guan Yu arrived at the Ancestral Hall, Elder Jiu remained awake, paying respects to past immortals. Bowing respectfully, Guan Yu inquired, “Elder Jiu, you’re still up so late?”

“I awaited your return. Join me for tea if you’re not weary,” the elder gestured to the adjacent tatami. Curiosity gleamed in his eyes as he studied the young man.

“I’ve always been a night owl,” Guan Yu smiled, settling beside the elder.

Elder Jiu lifted the teapot and sighed. “Alas, the tea’s gone cold, and Xiao Dong has retired. Would you mind preparing fresh tea?”

“Gladly, but where might I find the utensils and hot water?”

“Come, I’ll show you.” The elder rose, teapot in hand, with Guan Yu following silently.

The rear courtyard astonished Guan Yu—its meticulous upkeep surpassed even the front compound. Vegetable plots dominated the left side, brimming with produce that sustained the elder and his attendant.

**Chapter 3,1166: Tacit Understanding**

“That’s the kitchen,” Elder Jiu pointed. “We’ll need to boil water first.” Noticing an earthen stove with a cauldron, Guan Yu volunteered, “Allow me,” and began kindling fire with prepared firewood.

As flames danced, the elder chuckled, “Soon we’ll have tea!” His cheerful demeanor prompted Guan Yu to ask, “What teas do you favor, Elder?”

Though no connoisseur, Guan Yu knew expensive varieties signaled quality. “I require tea daily—two pots at least,” the elder replied. “Good leaves please me most, but ordinary ones suffice when needed.”

“Had I known earlier, I could’ve brought hundreds of varieties from my former residence.”

“Hundreds? Fetch them when next you return! My stores dwindle perilously.”

“Certainly. But forgive my curiosity—how do you replenish supplies while confined here?”

The elder’s eyes twinkled. “When you arrived with Elder Lu, didn’t you notice? Let’s maintain our tacit understanding.” Guan Yu recalled their approach through southwestern foothills—the hidden path through woods explained everything. The elder clearly slipped out periodically to procure tea.

As water boiled, Guan Yu filled the pot. “Best let it cool slightly.” They settled at a stone table where Elder Jiu posed, “Tell me, how came you to Cloud Azure Mountain?”

Guan Yu sighed. “I was captured by Qianhui Peak disciples. A village sought help against beasts devouring livestock and people. The ‘monster’ proved to be their chief’s son—a family cursed by demonic poison generations ago...”

He recounted discovering the Demon Clan’s Life Tree, his near-fatal mistake prevented by timely intervention. Elder Jiu nodded gravely. “That tree must remain—destroying it would unleash deadly miasma and attract demon hordes.”

Sipping tea, the elder probed, “You’re no ordinary youth. Your bearing suggests experience beyond your years. What life did you lead before?”

**Chapter 3,1167: Righteous and Demonic Never Mix**

“City life differs utterly,” Guan Yu explained. “While you cultivate amidst spiritual energy, we’ve advanced technologically. Firearms dominate warfare now—projectiles faster than any cultivator’s movement, lethal to vital points.”

Elder Jiu chuckled. “I visited cities decades apart. The transformation astounds—from war-torn ruins to glittering metropolises.”

When Guan Yu questioned preserving tea for decades, the elder revealed, “Special storage methods. I once grew my own, but found it tedious.”

Their conversation turned profound when the elder confessed, “I guard our sect’s sacred relic here—punishment for sparing the Demon Lord’s daughter long ago.”

Guan Yu ventured, “You must have loved her deeply.”

“To this day, no regret,” the elder’s voice softened. “She committed no evil, yet was hunted for her bloodline. Our factions’ enmity doomed us—I returned to aid my sect, accepting exile here.”

“But why must righteous and demonic never reconcile?” Guan Yu challenged.

“Tradition deems demons inherently evil,” the elder sighed. “Yet I agree—morality isn’t born of faction. Many ‘righteous’ commit atrocities while some demons show virtue. But voice such thoughts publicly, and you’ll be branded a traitor.”

As night deepened, their dialogue peeled back layers of sect politics and personal sacrifice—the elder’s poignant memories of lost love juxtaposed against Guan Yu’s modern perspectives, forging unexpected understanding between generations.
