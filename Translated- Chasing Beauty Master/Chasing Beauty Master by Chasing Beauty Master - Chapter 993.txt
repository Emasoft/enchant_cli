“Otherwise, why would you ask me to wait until evening to inform the sisters? You’re reserving this afternoon for yourself, aren’t you? If Guan Yu’s whereabouts are confirmed by tonight, I’ll know you’re hiding something from me. Don’t blame me then for disowning you as my sworn sister!”

Xue Jing’s tone grew increasingly grave. Ling’er’s small mouth fell open in astonishment. She hadn’t anticipated Xue Jing’s sharpness in deducing her secret thoughts so accurately. Every word Xue Jing spoke mirrored Ling’er’s internal calculations.

Currently, Ling’er couldn’t reveal Golden Flower’s location to Xue Jing. Her only recourse was to persuade Xue Jing to delay informing their sisters until evening, thereby buying herself the afternoon to investigate Golden Flower’s whereabouts. If Guan Yu were found there, she could urge him to contact the Qiaoyuan District immediately. If not, genuine danger might be imminent, warranting alerting the sisters.

Yet Ling’er never imagined her carefully constructed plan would be dismantled so swiftly. Stunned into silence, she struggled to formulate a response.

“What’s with that expression? Cat got your tongue? Did I hit the mark?” Xue Jing pressed. “Ling’er, you’ve always been an honest child. Are you really willing to jeopardize Guan Yu’s safety by keeping secrets today?”

Ling’er bit her lip until it whitened, the truth burning her tongue unspoken. She had sworn to Guan Yu never to disclose Golden Flower’s existence to anyone. Revealing it now would betray his trust and potentially endanger him further.

Memories resurfaced of treating Golden Flower’s sword wound months prior—an injury suggesting hidden perils. From that moment, Ling’er understood Golden Flower was no ordinary person but someone whose identity demanded absolute secrecy. Not even her own mother knew of this.

“Sister Jingjing,” Ling’er implored, desperation tinging her voice, “even if you distrust me, shouldn’t you trust Brother Guan? Rather than exchanging accusations here, shouldn’t we devote this time to searching for him?”

“I might trust you,” Xue Jing retorted, “but never that Guan Yu. He’s never given us a moment’s peace—disappearing for days without warning, making everyone worry sick.” Her words carried relentless suspicion.

The office door suddenly burst open. Guan Yu entered with an easy grin. “Enough tormenting Ling’er. I’m right here.”

“Brother Guan!” Ling’er gasped. “Why are you here? Sister Jingjing came specifically to find you!”

Xue Jing’s theatrical gasp mirrored mock outrage. “Guan Yu! Where have you been all this time? Do you have any idea how worried we’ve been?” Her sharp eyes darted between them before narrowing in sudden comprehension.

Pointing accusingly, she declared, “Now I understand! If I’m not mistaken, Guan Yu’s been hiding here since his disappearance! Caught red-handed—what excuses remain?”

“It’s not what you think!” Ling’er protested frantically. “I swear by heaven—by my father’s honor—I truly didn’t know Brother Guan was here!”

Guan Yu sighed. Ling’er had guarded his secret admirably until that fatal slip. Xue Jing’s keen perception detected the shift in Ling’er’s demeanor—the transition from composed evasion to panicked sincerity.

**Chapter 2539: The Prank (Part 2)**

“Enough,” Guan Yu interjected warmly. “Continue this charade and Ling’er will burst into tears.” True to his words, Ling’er’s quivering lips and brimming eyes betrayed her fragile composure.

Xue Jing’s laughter tinkled like wind chimes. “Remarkable—Ling’er’s resolve held firm under interrogation. Truly reliable.” Noticing Ling’er’s bewildered expression, she softened. “Don’t take it to heart, dear. This was all a jest. Guan Yu and I planned this visit together—a spontaneous prank. My intense questioning was mere acting.”

“You... came together?” Ling’er blinked at them alternately.

Guan Yu stepped forward with an apologetic smile. “Indeed. Xue Jing meant no harm—it was all in good fun.”

“Oh!” Ling’er clutched her chest, exhaling shakily. “You frightened me half to death! I nearly broke down under Sister Jingjing’s questioning. How could you play such a cruel joke?”

Xue Jing’s eyes sparkled with mischief. “This little test revealed much. Clearly, Guan Yu still keeps secrets.”

As Guan Yu shook his head ruefully, Ling’er puzzled, “Brother Guan, I revealed nothing. Why that look?”

The moment the words escaped, she paled. Xue Jing’s razor-sharp mind would inevitably dissect the implication.

“Forgive me...” Ling’er whispered. Though relieved Xue Jing remained ignorant of Golden Flower, she vowed eternal silence on the matter.

“The fault isn’t yours,” Guan Yu conceded. “Xue Jing’s cunning unraveled us. Your oath, while preserving the secret’s letter, betrayed its spirit through artless sincerity.”

Regret gnawed at Guan Yu. This ill-advised prank—Xue Jing’s brainchild—had manipulated them both. Her strategic brilliance shone in extracting truths through calculated misdirection.

Earlier, eavesdropping outside, Guan Yu had admired Ling’er’s steadfastness under Xue Jing’s barrage. He’d entered intending to conclude the charade, only for Xue Jing to escalate with her feigned misunderstanding—a masterstroke exposing Ling’er’s telltale desperation.

“But how did my oath betray me?” Ling’er implored.

Xue Jing explained gently, “Your immediate invocation of your revered father’s honor to dispel suspicion contrasted starkly with earlier evasions. Why hesitate to swear then? The discrepancy confirmed concealed knowledge.”

Guan Yu nodded. “Thus, without uttering specifics, you confirmed my secrets.”

Ling’er’s shoulders slumped. “My careless words... I’m so sorry.”

“No harm done,” Guan Yu reassured. “The core secret remains intact. Besides, Xue Jing’s no outsider. This simply proves your guileless nature.”

Xue Jing chuckled. “I’ve long sensed his hidden affairs. Today’s farce merely amused me.”

Relieved, Ling’er changed subjects. “Why visit today?”

“Guan Yu arranged to meet someone here,” Xue Jing replied. “We arrived early and thought to surprise you.”

“Please never surprise me thus again!” Ling’er pleaded, hand still pressed to her racing heart.

Checking his watch, Guan Yu noted, “Our contact should arrive soon. Isn’t your shift ending, Ling’er?”

Nodding, she served them water. “No hurry. I’ve no pressing matters.”

Xue Jing sipped casually. “Did you hear? Qu Meimei divorced.”

Ling’er’s cup clattered. “Impossible!”

“I accompanied her myself this morning,” Guan Yu confirmed.

“But... why?” Ling’er stammered. “They married so recently!”

Xue Jing’s expression darkened. “That beast of a husband... a drug addict who beat her.”

As the sordid tale unfolded—narcotics, violence, escape—Ling’er’s fists clenched. “How dare he! Divorce was imperative! Those drugs... it’s criminal!”

“What’s done is done,” Xue Jing sighed. “Now free, I’ll find her a proper city match.”

**Chapter 2540: The Club (Part 1)**

Concerned, Ling’er called Qu Meimei. “Are you alright? I just heard...”

Surprised, Qu Meimei admitted shamefacedly, “I’m managing. No need to worry.”

“Stay with me awhile,” Ling’er urged. “While nursing your aunt at the hospital, we’ll keep each other company.”

Before Qu Meimei could respond, a bloodcurdling scream erupted downstairs. Guan Yu and Xue Jing bolted toward the commotion.

The nearly empty club’s staff clustered around the men’s restroom. Manager Hou Jinshun arrived panting. “What’s happened?”

“A... a corpse!” stammered a pale waitress.

Inside, a young woman’s lifeless body slumped on a toilet—neck bruised, clothes torn. Guan Yu checked for vital signs. “Still warm. Murdered recently.”

Hou confirmed her identity: “Xiao Qi, our cashier. Worked here six months. Gentle soul—who’d harm her?”

As staff panicked about calling police, Guan Yu intervened. “No. The killer’s among us.” He ordered lockdown and assembly of all personnel.

The cleaning lady recounted discovering the body during final checks. Xue Jing analyzed the scene—public restrooms accessible to all, female victim in male facilities suggesting foul play.

“Any known conflicts?” Guan Yu pressed.

Staff shook their heads. Xue Jing scrutinized the three male servers. “Who heard anything?”

Silence. Hou hesitated. “Reporting this... the club’s reputation...”

Guan Yu nodded. “First, contain this. Then we investigate.”
