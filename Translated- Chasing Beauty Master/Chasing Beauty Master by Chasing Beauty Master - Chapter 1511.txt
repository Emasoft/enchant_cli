"Master Li, if you have more to say, let's save it for later. We're in a government office, after all. Even as the wealthiest family here, we can't act recklessly." Old Master Li raised his hand to stop Young Master Li, recognizing that Captain Yu wouldn't tolerate their usual tactics here.

If this escalated further, complications would multiply. Guan Yu observed that Old Master Li still maintained reason, knowing when to withdraw.

"Captain Yu's majesty and righteous spirit have touched all present. We're deeply impressed," Guan Yu flattered, recognizing the captain's upright nature and fondness for praise.

Captain Yu smiled. "Let's return to business. If you don't want punishment, tell me truthfully—what did Councilman Pang and Young Master Li discuss in their pavilion?"

A trembling woman answered, "They...they usually joked about women and how to make them obey orders."

"Will you free me if I speak?" another woman asked pragmatically. Captain Yu promised freedom and rewards for useful information.

"Excellent! Young Master Li is the main culprit behind slave trafficking. He captures people, 'educates' them into obedience, then sells them abroad. Councilman Pang merely assisted for profit," a woman exposed.

"Councilman Pang claimed coercion by Young Master Li, but how explain keeping slaves in government offices?" Captain Yu questioned.

Councilman Pang confessed, "Li threatened me with profits to use his office facilities. The government building provided ideal cover."

Old Master Li interjected angrily, "You take an unknown woman's word as truth? Surely you're not so naive!"

Captain Yu calmly shifted responsibility to the Prefect. After gathering evidence, the group prepared for the journey to the prefectural capital.

Guan Yu volunteered escort duty, suspecting Old Master Li might hire mercenaries to ambush them.

During interrogations, Councilman Pang revealed Li's murder of Liu Yun's husband after he discovered their crimes. Li's atrocities included killing disobedient slaves as examples.

With confessions secured, the convoy departed for the prefecture. Despite Li's threats, the party arrived safely by midnight.

Upon returning to the inn, Guan宇 informed Liu Yun of progress. Wang Xiaorong welcomed him warmly, arranging a feast despite his protests.

Liu Yun and daughter Xiao Yuan knelt tearfully in gratitude. "We can never repay your kindness in avenging our family," Liu Yun said.

Wang Xiaorong insisted on accompanying Guan Yu partway back to Qingyun Sect despite reluctance. After final arrangements for the mother-daughter pair, Guan宇 prepared to depart at dawn.

The next morning, Wang Xiaorong reluctantly bid farewell as Guan Yu began his journey home, mission accomplished.
