Ge Yinglai felt his anger rising at Guan Yu's tone—the man's arrogance was utterly infuriating. Yet he dared not truly lose his temper, knowing full well Guan Yu's capabilities. If it came to open conflict, Ge Yinglai would undoubtedly be the one to suffer.

“Not a big deal? How casually you say that, Boss Guan! If you saw your woman being ridden by another man, would you still call it trivial?” Ge Yinglai retorted.

Guan Yu's brows snapped together. Those words had struck a nerve. His women were forbidden territory—even metaphors or jokes about them were intolerable in his presence.

**Chapter 2,424: Lack of Courtesy**

“Choose your words carefully,” Guan Yu said coldly. “Lest you harm yourself. If Jia Bo appears unharmed within half an hour, I’ll consider sparing you face. Otherwise, this matter won’t end peacefully.”

“Of course I must respect Boss Guan’s reputation,” Ge Yinglai replied, though his smile was thin. “But you ought to rein in your subordinates. Actions have consequences. Let this incident pass, but mark my words: if it happens again, I won’t be so lenient.”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Since you mention it, I’ll inform you now: Kaihuang Academy’s cafeteria will no longer be open to outsiders. I’ve no interest in meddling in external affairs. How does that sound?”

Internally, Ge Yinglai cursed Guan Yu’s ancestors eighteen generations back. Yet he swallowed his rage—he still desperately needed access to Hua Xia’s cafeteria for its tender young girls, unmatched elsewhere.

Moreover, Ge Yinglai knew enough of Guan Yu’s resolve. If Guan Yu declared the cafeteria closed to outsiders, he meant it. Reluctantly, Ge Yinglai softened his tone. *Just wait,* he seethed silently. *Once I’ve prepared, we’ll see who truly rules A City’s academies.*

“Haha, Boss Guan exaggerates,” Ge Yinglai said aloud. “You can’t sever our… interests so abruptly. Last night’s affair was merely an opportunity to acquaint ourselves. I’ll release your brother shortly—unharmed. How’s that for courtesy?”

Though his words were honeyed, Ge Yinglai’s heart burned with the desire to slice Guan Yu into a thousand pieces.

“Splendid. I’ll remember this ‘courtesy,’” Guan Yu replied. “Since matters are settled, I’ll take my leave.” He hung up without ceremony, indifferent to Ge Yinglai’s fury.

The cafeteria remained under Sister Ji’s control. Shutting it down entirely would be difficult, and leaving it open risked future incidents. For now, Guan Yu could only order his men to avoid the place.

Wei Hongwei trembled as he asked, “Boss… is Jia Bo alright?”

“He’s fine. Our real problem is convincing Qian Yaoyao. Unless you want to die a bachelor.”

Wei Hongwei grimaced. With Qian Yaoyao’s father blocking contact, only Guan Yu’s intervention could salvage the relationship. “Let’s go see her,” Guan Yu decided.

“But… is it wise?” Wei Hongwei hesitated.

“Lü Mei’s already trying to calm her. We’ll gauge her mood.” As Guan Yu spoke, Xue Jing emerged, now changed.

“Greetings, Madam,” Wei Hongwei said politely.

“Where are we going?” Xue Jing asked, adjusting her mask.

“To Century Garden Academy to retrieve Jia Bo.” Guan Yu drove ahead in his Da Hang, Wei Hongwei trailing nervously. The consequences of losing Qian Yaoyao—and the potential humiliation—weighed heavily on him.

At Century Garden, Guan Yu headed straight for the Taekwondo Hall. True to rumors, Ge Yinglai was sparring inside. When Guan Yu entered, a pimpled youth blocked his path.

“Who let you in? Get lost!”

Ordinarily, Guan Yu would have kicked the fool aside. But today, with Jia Bo’s safety at stake, he ignored the provocation. “Is this how you greet guests, Boss Ge?” he called out.

Ge Yinglai turned with exaggerated surprise. “Ah, Boss Guan! Forgive these ill-mannered brats. Let him through!”

Once inside, Guan Yu cut to the chase. “I’m here for my man. Release him.”

“Of course.” Ge Yinglai barked an order. Moments later, Jia Bo appeared—hooded but unharmed.

“I’ll remember this favor,” Guan Yu said. “We’ll take our leave.”

“Wait!” Ge Yinglai’s men encircled Wei Hongwei. “Did I mention letting *him* go? This vermin defiled my woman last night. You promised nothing about *him*.”

**Chapter 2,425: No Need for Your Concern**

“They conspired to humiliate me!” Ge Yinglai spat. “If I let this slide, my men will revolt. He *must* be punished.”

Guan Yu’s eyes narrowed. This trap had been set from the start. “Very well. Do as you please with them. But remember—” His aura turned glacial, chilling nearby onlookers. “—whatever harm you inflict, I’ll return tenfold. Dispose of them, then we’ll discuss… consequences.”

As Guan Yu turned to leave, Ge Yinglai stalled him. “A duel, then! If you win, take both. Lose, and face my terms.”

Guan Yu smirked. Ge Yinglai, now a Second-Class Zun Mid-Level cultivator after secret training, clearly sought to test his limits. “As you wish.”

“Be careful,” Xue Jing whispered. “He might cheat.”

“A mere Second-Class Zun?” Guan Yu scoffed. “Not even a First-Class worries me.”

The crowd cleared a ring. Ge Yinglai lunged first, strikes swift and precise. Guan Yu parried lazily, unimpressed.

“Bold words!” Ge Yinglai taunted. “Hope you don’t mind bruises!”

“Try landing one first,” Guan Yu replied, smile intact.

**Chapter 2,426: Underhanded Tricks**

Even as they clashed, Guan Yu analyzed Ge Yinglai’s motives. This confrontation wasn’t just personal—someone powerful pulled Ge Yinglai’s strings. Tonight’s duel would expose much.

Ge Yinglai pressed harder, techniques refined under his mysterious mentor. Yet Guan Yu’s defenses remained effortless, each movement economical. The onlookers murmured as realization dawned: their boss was outclassed.

“Enough games,” Guan Yu said suddenly. With a twist of his wrist, he disarmed Ge Yinglai, palm halting a hair’s breadth from the man’s throat. “Your backer’s next.”

The hall fell silent. Ge Yinglai’s face purpled with rage and shame. Guan Yu turned to his men. “We’re leaving.”

As they exited, Xue Jing glanced back. “He’ll retaliate.”

“Let him.” Guan Yu’s smile held winter. “The angrier he grows, the sooner his patron emerges.”

Behind them, Ge Yinglai’s roar of frustration echoed through the hall. The game had just begun.
