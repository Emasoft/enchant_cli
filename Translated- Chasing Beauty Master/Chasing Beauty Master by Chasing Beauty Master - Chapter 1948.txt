“Why are there suddenly so many snakes appearing?” Jiang Yuan asked curiously, then continued, “I think such a massive swarm of snakes gathering simultaneously must be driven by something or someone. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be swarming all over the mountains and fields toward us.”

Guanyu found Jiang Yuan’s reasoning plausible. Perhaps someone was secretly targeting them, using some method to summon these snakes.

“That means we’ve been followed all along, and they’re now making their move here. It seems our adversary is cunning. We must remain vigilant,” Duan Ruxue said.

“The enemy lurks in the shadows while we’re exposed. Everyone must stay cautious,” Jiang Yuan added. “Fortunately, Brother Wan and Miss Xiaorong are cultivators, which helped us repel this snake assault. Otherwise, dealing with such a massive horde would’ve been far more difficult.”

Standing at their original vantage point, they saw thick smoke rising from the mountain peak—flames had clearly taken hold, though separated by another mountain, the fire posed no immediate threat.

After resting briefly, Guanyu remarked, “We’re now at the foot of Pagoda Mountain. The East Sea should be nearby, right?”

His question was directed at Duan Ruxue, who nodded. “Yes. My father said once we reach Pagoda Mountain, we’re very close to the East Sea. It lies to the east of this mountain.”

“My father once told me that when he and my grandfather lived here, they farmed on a hill near Pagoda Mountain. They fled after noticing the East Sea’s upheaval. So the sea must indeed be nearby.”

The group pressed onward, circling halfway around Pagoda Mountain. The steep, rugged terrain offered little in the way of paths, forcing them to advance cautiously.

Beyond the mountain, to their left stretched a vast basin-like plain. Guanyu spotted a massive square boulder perched on a nearby hill.

It became apparent that a section of Pagoda Mountain had broken off—this boulder must have fallen from its peak.

Guanyu recalled Old Master Duan’s account: during the East Sea’s upheaval, his grandfather and father had survived by hiding behind a giant boulder.

“If I’m not mistaken,” Guanyu pointed, “that boulder over there must be the one the Duan family sheltered behind. The terraced fields where they farmed should be nearby.”

“How can you be so sure? Where did you get that from?” Qiqi asked.

Instead of answering, Guanyu gestured to the basin on their left. “If I’m correct, this was once East Sea Town—the location of the East Sea itself.”

Duan Ruxue nodded, agreeing the area matched her father’s descriptions. The old East Sea Town had been nestled in a basin surrounded by mountains on three sides and the sea on the fourth. Yet now, no traces of the village remained—no East Sea, not even a puddle.

“This can’t be it,” Wang Xiaorong said. “Aren’t we here for the East Sea? Where’s the sea? There’s not even a town here.”

Jiang Yuan gazed ahead. “Old Master Duan mentioned the land changed after the sea’s upheaval. After all these years, it’s no surprise it looks like this.”

“Let’s inspect that boulder first. The view from there might clarify things,” Guanyu suggested. To their right lay undulating mountains; to the left, the dense basin forest. Despite the cold, the trees thrived, their tangled growth making passage difficult.

Crossing a ravine, the group reached the square boulder. Guanyu stood beside it, surveying the landscape.

“This must be where the Duan family farmed,” he concluded. “No other boulders exist on nearby hills. The area below us was undoubtedly East Sea Town.”

“Brother Jiang,” Guanyu said, “since we’re here, let’s investigate. Treasure won’t come to us. No matter how the land changed, the East Sea’s location remains fixed.”

**Chapter 5119: Signal Guidance**

The five descended the slope, the forest thickening with every step.

At the mountain’s base, the low-lying ground lay buried under soggy leaves, the muddy terrain slowing their progress. Dim light filtered through the canopy, revealing decaying branches and animal remains that fouled the air.

“This basin’s perpetual dampness worries me,” Guanyu warned. “There might be swamps. Walk single-file behind me. I’ll lead.”

As they inched forward, Qiqi complained, “The stench here is unbearable! We’ve walked forever but barely covered any ground.”

Guanyu glanced back at the distant boulder. Their pace was indeed sluggish, but caution was necessary. He periodically probed the path with his Soulfall Blade, hearing only distant animal cries.

“This feels like ordinary woods,” Wang Xiaorong said. “Where’s the East Sea? Did we take a wrong turn?”

Even Duan Ruxue seemed uncertain now. Guanyu shared her doubt—where were the ruins of a town? Not even a foundation remained beneath the layers of mulch.

The ground quivered suddenly. “An earthquake?” Guanyu wondered aloud.

As he stepped forward, the earth gave way. Wang Xiaorong tumbled after him into the pit. Reacting swiftly, Guanyu slammed his blade into solid ground, anchoring them.

Duan Ruxue screamed while Jiang Yuan and Qiqi froze in terror. The ground trembled violently, leaves cascading into a widening chasm.

“Don’t move!” Guanyu shouted, clinging to his blade with one hand and Wang Xiaorong with the other.

After a minute-long tremor, stillness returned. Guanyu hoisted Wang Xiaorong to safety before pulling himself up.

Before them yawned a fifteen-meter-wide fissure snaking into the mountains—their path cleaved in two.

Though the gap was crossable, the near-disaster left them shaken. Peering into the abyss’s impenetrable darkness, Guanyu murmured, “That was too close. Had we been a step further...”

“Why did this happen?” Jiang Yuan wondered. “A goat crossed here earlier without incident.”

Qiqi pointed at his waist. “Something’s glowing!”

The East Sea Dragon Pearl at Jiang Yuan’s belt pulsed with light. “We’re on the right path,” he realized. “The pearl senses the East Sea’s proximity.”

“Exactly,” Guanyu agreed. “It’s signaling. We must be near.”

Duan Ruxue nodded. “This has to be East Sea Town’s remains. The pearl confirms it—the East Sea can’t be far.”

**Chapter 5120: Wrong Direction**

“Could the sea have dried up over time?” Duan Ruxue pondered. “All we see are trees.”

“Possibly,” Jiang Yuan said. “Where we stand might have been underwater. But the pearl will lead us to the treasure, sea or not.”

Guanyu turned to Wang Xiaorong. “Are you alright? Need rest?”

“I’m fine,” she replied quietly. “Just shaken. Let’s keep moving.”

Using their cultivation skills, the group leaped across the chasm. Guanyu led more cautiously now, testing the ground with his blade.

“Wait,” Jiang Yuan halted them later, showing the dimming pearl. “Its light fades. Either we’re moving away from the source, or its energy wanes.”

“Then we backtrack,” Guanyu decided. “We’ll monitor the pearl’s glow.”

Retracing their steps, the pearl brightened as dusk fell. Exhausted and hungry, they sought refuge in a massive tree.

“We’ll rest here tonight,” Guanyu said. “The branches are safer than damp ground.”

After settling everyone, Guanyu hunted two pheasants. “Xiaorong, clear the leaves with wind magic. I’ll gather firewood.”

The group prepared for a cold, uncomfortable night—but alive, and closer to their goal.
