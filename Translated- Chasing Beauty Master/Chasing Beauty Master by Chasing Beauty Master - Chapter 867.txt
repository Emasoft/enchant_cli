“Hehe, you’re such an amateur here,” Second to Wolf declared haughtily. Being a prideful man by nature, he finally felt he had bested his junior sister and reclaimed his dignity.

The junior sister nodded silently to herself. Indeed, if the attack traveled underground, it would remain invisible—only the faint glow atop the eastern mountain and the falling trees could be seen.

Now it made sense why the earlier sounds had been accompanied by rumbling echoes. She had initially attributed it to the sheer destructive power of Second to Wolf’s skill, but now realized it was due to the technique tunneling beneath the earth.

“Any last questions before you die? I’ll gladly enlighten you,” he drawled leisurely.

**Chapter 2252: A Fatal Blow**

The junior sister nodded again, confirming her earlier deduction. Underground movement explained the lack of visible traces—only the aftermath of light and toppled trees on the eastern slope.

Recalling the thunderous echoes, she finally understood. What she had mistaken for the raw force of his attack was actually the skill’s subterranean passage.

“Any final curiosities? Consider it a parting gift,” he repeated, his tone languid.

“Hmph!” The junior sister suddenly sneered, her voice dripping with mockery. “Do you truly believe you can still kill me?”

“Damn it!” A crimson flash erupted as Second to Wolf slashed his blade furiously, dispelling a dozen illusions. He stood coldly amidst the remnants.

Unbeknownst to him, the junior sister had already begun retreating during their exchange. His initial strike had wounded her true form, which had concealed itself among the decoys. The illusions were mere distractions to buy time for her escape.

Humiliation burned through Second to Wolf. In a rage, he obliterated the remaining clones and expanded his senses to track her fleeing presence.

Wounded and slow, the junior sister fled desperately, pursued by a First-Class Supreme expert. After a brief search, Second to Wolf smirked. “You can’t hide. My blade’s mark betrays you.”

His voice seemed to pierce her ears mid-flight. Cornered, she resolved to make a final stand.

Her true weapon—a leather belt coiled at her waist—whipped out to block his incoming strike. Though supple, it clanged metallically against his blade, sparks flying as it deflected each lethal swing.

The belt moved with uncanny sentience, intercepting every attack. She dared not summon more illusions, knowing even a hundred would crumble before a Supreme expert’s gaze.

Exposed and weapon fraying, she channeled all her energy into a desperate hand seal. “**Break!**” she shouted. The belt erupted in dark light, lunging toward him.

Though the counterstrike forced Second to Wolf into momentary disarray, admiration flickered within him—her skill was undeniable. Yet sentiment held no place in his heart. As a top assassin of a global syndicate, mercy was foreign.

His blade flushed crimson once more. A cold gust swept past—the junior sister felt her throat chill before collapsing lifelessly, a bloodless gash across her neck.

Second to Wolf sheathed his weapon coldly and departed without a glance.

By noon the next day, Guanyu learned of her death. Surprisingly, Elder Qing showed little grief—betrayal had hardened him. The junior sister’s alliance with a Supreme expert to ambush Guanyu was unforgivable.

Upon hearing of Guanyu’s injuries, Madam Qing visited with her daughter Ling’er.

Qiaoyuan District’s gates now loomed like prison walls—thick steel plates replacing the former European-style entrance. When the doorbell chimed, Amei checked the monitor to find a middle-aged woman and a beautiful girl outside.

Unfamiliar with the visitors, she fetched Xuejing. The latter recognized Ling’er but not her mother. After verifying their identities via intercom, the gates parted.

Madam Qing gaped at the sprawling estate—luxury cars, a four-story villa with floor-to-ceiling glass walls exuding modern elegance. Xuejing greeted them warmly at the courtyard’s midpoint.

**Chapter 2253: The Visit**

Ling’er clasped her mother’s hand as they approached. “Auntie, hello!” she greeted politely.

“What a lovely girl!” Madam Qing beamed at Xuejing’s radiant smile.

“Ling’er, how kind of you to visit,” Xuejing replied.

“Mother insisted after hearing of Brother Guanyu’s sacrifice for Father,” Ling’er explained as they reached the entrance.

Madam Qing’s weathered hands and sun-worn face contrasted starkly with Ling’er’s porcelain beauty. Xuejing’s heart ached—such selfless dedication to one’s child explained Guanyu’s unwavering support.

Amei emerged, recognizing Ling’er from a prior birthday celebration. “You’ve grown even prettier!”

Madam Qing marveled at both girls’ ethereal grace. Inside, the immaculate white interiors—gleaming crystal chandeliers, spotless furniture—left her hesitant to tread further.

“Please, treat this as your home,” Xuejing urged, offering slippers.

“Might you have darker ones?” Madam Qing fretted, eyeing the pristine white footwear.

“Don’t worry, Auntie,” Amei reassured. “We clean constantly.”

As Madam Qing gingerly settled on the snow-white sofa, Xuejing fetched others downstairs. Zhang Han and Lü Mei, initially absorbed in gaming, hurried down upon learning guests had arrived.

**Chapter 2254: Envy and Admiration**

Upstairs, Yang Conghan kept Guanyu company. “They’re here? I’ll greet them properly,” she said, exemplifying her upbringing.

The contrast between generations played out in every detail—Madam Qing’s calloused hands against Ling’er’s delicate features, the humble visitor awed by opulence yet welcomed with genuine warmth. Through it all, the unspoken bonds of respect and sacrifice wove their quiet tapestry.
