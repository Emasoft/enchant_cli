“It’s not that easy,” Minister Li replied with a troubled expression. “The imperial prison is heavily guarded by the First Prince’s men. Getting inside is extremely difficult. Even delivering a message to Minister Qi required a hefty bribe. Without silver, entering would be impossible.”

“If silver can solve it, it’s no true obstacle,” the Second Prince said dismissively. “I’ll give you ten thousand taels. Will that suffice? Use it to bribe every layer of the prison. Once that’s done, gather detailed information.”

“I can attempt it, but I cannot guarantee success,” Minister Li replied cautiously.

Though the Second Prince funded the bribe, Minister Li knew ten thousand taels was excessive—yet he harbored no complaints. Excess silver would line his own pockets.

To his surprise, this task proved profitable. With the Second Prince’s silver in hand, Minister Li worked swiftly. His men first secured unrestricted access to the prison, paving the way for further schemes.

Unbeknownst to them, the “imprisoned guards” were decoys. The real prisoners, hidden elsewhere by the First Prince, meant Minister Li’s messages never reached their intended targets. Instead, they fell into the First Prince’s hands.

Upon learning the captives were ready to talk, the First Prince raced to the prison. The prisoners, having discovered Minister Qi’s plot to silence them, had conspired to reveal their secrets. A squad leader even produced a token identifying their group as trained assassins.

Armed with evidence, the First Prince stormed Minister Qi’s residence. As Minister Qi returned from meeting the Second Prince, he was seized without ceremony.

“Your Highness, this treatment is unjust!” Minister Qi protested, struggling as his household panicked.

“Explain this!” The First Prince coldly tossed the token before him. “Your men have confessed. Before His Majesty, you’ll answer for this treason.”

Minister Qi paled but retorted, “I acted under orders! You know who pulls my strings. Arresting me risks angering powers beyond your reach!”

“A barefoot man fears no one in shoes,” the First Prince snapped, enraged by the threat. “This ends now. Let’s see how far the Second Prince’s arrogance stretches. Take him away!”

News of Minister Qi’s arrest spread like wildfire. With confessions and evidence, his network of assassins crumbled. The enraged Emperor stripped Minister Qi of his Imperial Guard command and ordered the First Prince to seize his estate and the Cao family’s properties.

Yet Minister Qi shielded the Second Prince, claiming sole responsibility for plotting against Cao—a personal vendetta. The First Prince’s hope of crippling his rival faltered, though all understood Minister Qi’s silence aimed to protect his family through the Second Prince’s favor.

Minister Qi was sentenced to death; the Cao family faced extermination. Though the First Prince gained wealth and influence from the confiscations, the Emperor retained control of the Imperial Guard, distrusting both sons.

The Emperor’s wariness grew as the once-dull First Prince displayed sudden cunning. Meanwhile, the Cao family’s fall entangled the Qin family, though lacking evidence, the Emperor merely warned Qin without punishment.

**Chapter 4978: Delivering the Message**

At Hongyan Theater, progress continued smoothly, nearing completion without disruptions.

Upon returning, Prince Zou learned of the First Prince’s achievements. Though the Emperor rewarded him lavishly, no political power followed.

“Your handling of this affair has impressed His Majesty,” Prince Zou remarked.

“Princess Chang and Wan Hong deserve credit,” the First Prince admitted.

“Have you thanked them?” Prince Zou pressed.

“An oversight I’ll rectify,” the First Prince said, rising.

“Visit them now. Princess Chang and Jiangxin have returned to the驸马’s estate. With their support, even the Second Prince couldn’t rival you.”

As the First Prince prepared gifts, a summons from the Emperor interrupted.

**In the Imperial Study**

“Your diligence pleases me,” the Emperor said, reviewing reports. “Yet Minister Qi’s wealth surpassing the Cao family’s shocks me.”

“The Cao clan relied on daughters and corrupt deals,” the First Prince replied. “Minister Qi exploited his position under the Second Prince.”

“Your recent brilliance puzzles me. What changed?”

“A mentor—Wan Hong—guided me,” the First Prince revealed.

“Wan Hong?” The Emperor turned to Eunuch Yu. “The one who gifted Jiangxin the Eastern Sea Pearl?”

“Yes, Sire. Princess Chang and Jiangxin often speak of him.”

“Summon him. I wish to meet this man.”

**Chapter 4979: Refusing Gifts**

Wan Hong (关宇), seizing the invitation, prepared to enter the palace—a chance to locate the elusive “Eight-Drum Technique” he believed hidden there.

Declining the First Prince’s lavish gifts, he insisted they aid northern famine victims.

At the驸马’s estate, Jiangxin conveyed her parents’ refusal to meet: “Helping you repaid saving me. Further ties are unwise.”

Gifts met the same rejection. “Send them north,” she echoed Wan Hong’s words.

Guided by the First Prince, Wan Hong entered the palace, eyes immediately drawn to a white jade stone beside the throne—inscribed “Longevity Rivaling Heaven.”
