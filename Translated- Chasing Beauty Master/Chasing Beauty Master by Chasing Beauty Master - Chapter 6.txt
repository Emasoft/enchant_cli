“Which eye saw me rummaging through the blankets?” Guan Yu asked calmly, his expression impassive.

“What’s wrong? You’re admitting it! I saw it the moment I entered!” Feng Lei blurted, momentarily stunned.

Before Feng Lei could close his mouth, Guan Yu abruptly pivoted, his entire body twisting as he swung a full-powered fist directly into Feng Lei’s eye socket!

He might have tolerated mere posturing to avoid troubling Liu Shilei, but this baseless accusation was beyond endurance. Slandering him like this? Fine—he’d abandon this university and return home to live freely!

With that resolve, Guan Yu struck.

Having decided to quit studying here, Guan Yu unleashed himself like an enraged lion. His heavy punch smashed into Feng Lei’s right eye, sending the man staggering backward.

Before Feng Lei could comprehend the blow through his cupped hands, Guan Yu charged forward, swinging a fist like a sandbag toward the side of Feng Lei’s head behind the ear!

**Chapter Thirteen: This Could Kill Someone**

The wind-whistling punch struck Feng Lei’s temple, dropping him to the ground with ringing ears. Dizziness overwhelmed him, stars dancing before his eyes.

Guan Yu gave no chance for retaliation. After a running start, he delivered a brutal kick to Feng Lei’s face—a soccer-style penalty shot that exploded blood across the floor. Feng Lei’s body spun like a top around his waist, rotating four or five times before halting.

Straddling Feng Lei, Guan Yu licked his lips and growled, “Say it again. When did I steal anything?”

Dazed, Feng Lei squinted upward with his left eye—only to receive a crushing knee strike as Guan Yu dropped down, pinning his shoulders.

Within moments, the storm of blows left Feng Lei crumpled on the floor. Both Liu Shilei and Mo Ling gaped, stunned.

The enraged Guan Yu resembled an avenging deity, his fury terrifying yet compelling.

Snatching a wooden stool from Mo Ling’s dorm, Guan Yu pressed a foot against Feng Lei’s head. “Repeat why you barged in here.”

Curled into a ball, Feng Lei feigned unconsciousness, humiliated. His swollen right eye sealed shut. Struggling would be futile now.

He desperately hoped the women would intervene, but both stood paralyzed, jaws slack at the violent reversal.

What followed turned gruesome. Guan Yu heaved the stool overhead like a sledgehammer and brought it crashing down on Feng Lei’s skull.

**Crack!** The chair shattered. Feng Lei howled as blood geysered from his head.

Screaming, Liu Shilei and Mo Ling retreated to the hallway, hands clamped over mouths.

Discarding the broken stool leg, Guan Yu dragged Feng Lei out by the ankles, leaving a smeared crimson trail across the tiles. The whimpering man clutched his bleeding skull.

“Lying bastard! Think you can frame me?!”

“Where’s your arrogance now? I’ll end you, you piece of shit!”

After hurling Feng Lei against the wall, Guan Yu leapt, delivering kick after savage kick.

Feng Lei’s agonized wails became pleas: “I’m sorry! Stop! I yield!”

“Fuck your ‘sorry’!” Guan Yu stomped on Feng Lei’s shin, drawing another scream.

The brutal scene left the women aghast. How had the composed Guan Yu transformed into this fury?

“Enough!” Liu Shilei finally rushed forward, blocking Guan Yu. After two final kicks to Feng Lei’s head, Guan Yu spat, “Moron. Should’ve known better.”

Mo Ling timidly tugged his sleeve. “Stop… calm down.”

“Wait—I still need to change pants.” Guan Yu reentered the dorm, emerged wearing jeans, and found Feng Lei gone—bloody handprints smearing the stairwell wall.

“Still walking? Not dead yet,” Guan Yu remarked coolly.

Liu Shilei pulled him inside. “Are you insane? You could’ve killed him! He’s staff!”

Guan Yu shrugged. “Sorry, sis. Couldn’t take his lies anymore.”

“Murder has consequences!”

“Wasn’t trying to kill him,” he muttered. Years of street brawls had honed his violence, but death? Never considered it—until now.

“I’ll go home,” Guan Yu announced, reaching for his luggage.

“Abandon college over this?”

Guan Yu froze. Attacking a teacher as an incoming freshman…

Liu Shilei sighed. “No punishment. We witnessed him attack first.” She nodded at Mo Ling.

“Right! He tried assaulting Teacher Liu!” Mo Ling added.

“Assault you!” Liu Shilei retorted, rolling her eyes.

“Last time,” Liu Shilei warned sternly. “No more fighting.”

**Chapter Fourteen: Wonders of Gravity Manipulation**

Guan Yu marveled—the incident was dismissed? His concern shifted to repercussions for Liu Shilei.

After her scolding, Mo Ling escorted him to campus lodgings. Alone, Guan Yu examined his healing palm—fully recovered without scar. The 20% healing boost worked miracles. At full power? Instant recovery!

Testing gravity manipulation, he leapt effortlessly to the ceiling. Lightness granted spider-like agility, though coordination lagged. Heavy gravity mode proved excruciating—every cell compressed.

Experimenting, he tossed an ashtray. Applying mid-air weight increase, it plummeted abruptly. Deflecting projectiles? Possible.

**Chapter Fifteen: Miraculous Power**

Guan Yu chuckled—others would revel in one ability, yet he lamented gravity’s offensive limits. Still, reduced weight granted superhuman mobility. Mastery required practice.

As he pondered, the treatment system’s cooldown reset. Both powers now available. Grinning, he shadowboxed silently, mind racing with possibilities.
