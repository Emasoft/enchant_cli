Guan Yu showed no trace of nervousness, smiling as he said, "What if I refuse both options? What then? Would your grand manor truly stoop to ganging up on fewer opponents?"

"Exactly! Aren't you afraid of tarnishing No-Sword Manor's reputation when this spreads?" Du Teng chimed in. "The Number One Manor in the Realm resorting to mob tactics and silencing witnesses? If word gets out, your manor's peace will be shattered—this goes beyond mere face-saving!"

"Ha! How considerate of you to worry for us," the opponent chuckled, raising his sword skyward. A metallic whisper swept through the courtyard as blades gleamed. "But your concerns are needless—you'll be dead before dawn!"

As the man gestured his command, Wang Xiaorong's crossbow—aimed at the speaker since his first threat—thrummed. The bolt pierced his throat before his sword arm completed its arc. Gurgling blood, the man collapsed backward like felled timber, crimson blooming across his collar.

The courtyard froze. Swords hung mid-air as men stared at their fallen comrade. Even Du Teng and Zhenxiang gaped at Wang Xiaorong, though they'd witnessed her weapon's lethal efficiency earlier. At this closer range—barely ten paces—the ambush had been mercilessly precise.

The attacker's lieutenant retrieved the bloodied bolt embedded ten centimeters deep in a peach tree. "Cowardly tricks!" he spat, brandishing the projectile. "Using hidden weapons like gutter assassins!"

"Chapter 4154: Rogues of the Martial World"

Guan Yu spread his hands innocently. "Your ultimatum left no choice. When threatened, even rabbits bite."

"Enough talk!" Du Teng's eyes glittered with grim satisfaction. Each twang of Wang Xiaorong's crossbow spelled doom for their attackers. "They came for blood—we're merely returning the favor."

"Vermin like you deserve no mercy," Wang Xiaorong said coldly, though her fingers trembled slightly. These were her first kills, but survival justified any means.

Another bolt sang. A skull shattered like porcelain, spraying bone fragments. The remaining swordsmen recoiled as their comrade's body thudded to the ground. Du Teng smirked at their terror. "Look at them scuttle! Who's the predator now?"

"Chapter 4155: A Cup of Tea"

"Enough!" A voice like tempered steel cut through the chaos. Upon a stone platform stood a masked figure in white robes, his presence silencing the courtyard. "Retreat. These are beyond your match."

The disciples bowed as one. "Manor Lord!"

Guan Yu clasped his fists. "The peerless No-Sword Immortal honors us."

The masked lord gestured toward a pavilion. "Though you breached my wards, guests merit hospitality. Tea?"

Within a sparse chamber smelling of sandalwood incense, the immortal studied Wang Xiaorong's weapon. "That device intrigues me. Not spiritual energy nor martial force drives it—yet its fury surpasses both."

Guan Yu's smile didn't reach his eyes. "A humble tool for desperate times. Surely the Number One Manor needs no such trinkets?"

"Quality over quantity defines true strength." The immortal's masked face tilted. "A hundred disciples matter less than one perfected technique."

Du Teng leaned forward eagerly. "Your reputation—"

"Is built on understanding power's essence." The immortal's sleeve whispered as he poured tea. "Tell me, wanderers—what brings vipers to my mountain nest?"

Guan Yu sipped, tasting bitter herbs beneath the jasmine. Every nerve screamed danger, yet this was their only path forward. Somewhere beneath the immortal's courtesy lurked the serpent-charmer's malice—and answers they desperately needed.
