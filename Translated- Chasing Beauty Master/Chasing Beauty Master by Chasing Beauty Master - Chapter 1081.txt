“The best solution now is to follow Guan Yu’s suggestion to permanently eliminate future troubles. Let Xu Jinglei handle this matter—perhaps a single phone call will resolve it, sparing us further complications later.”

Guan Yu stood up, chewing on a large apple as he headed upstairs. Moments later, he emerged from his room holding a golden Desert Eagle pistol, its imposing aura evident at first glance.

Lin Qiaoqiao, with her tomboyish personality, adored such objects. The moment she saw the weapon in Guan Yu’s hand, she was instantly captivated.

“This thing is absolutely stunning,” she murmured, her entire focus consumed by the gun. Its only flaw, she thought, was its considerable weight—though that likely reduced recoil, which she supposed was an advantage.

Guan Yu approached and handed her the firearm. “Take it. I believe once you bring this gun back, you might even earn some credit. It’ll boost your reputation too. As for the rest, don’t trouble yourself.”

Lin Qiaoqiao eagerly accepted the pistol, turning it over in her hands. “Guan Yu, I’ve underestimated you,” she muttered. “Who’d have thought a layabout like you would own such a fine piece? And you’re so stingy—why didn’t you show it sooner? If I’d known earlier, I’d have borrowed it ages ago!”

**Chapter 2764: Lawyer Liu**

Guan Yu nearly choked on a bite of his apple. “Miss Lin,” he sputtered, “thank heavens you didn’t know! You’re a police captain! Borrowing this? Do you want me jailed eating moldy bread?”

Lin Qiaoqiao chuckled. “True, these are strictly prohibited. But it’s just so beautiful! Way more impressive than the junk our department issues.”

“Of course it is,” Guan Yu retorted. “Do you know how much it’d cost to equip every officer in China with these? A single bullet from this costs more than a full magazine from your standard issue. We’d go bankrupt!”

“Whatever,” Lin Qiaoqiao shrugged, still admiring the weapon. “I got what I wanted, and since you have your own solutions, I’ll stop worrying. I’m leaving now.”

“Go to work then. As long as that Officer Yu doesn’t fixate on me, we’re fine. Also, those two suspects belong to an underground group—dig into their backgrounds thoroughly.”

“Understood. Officer Yu won’t talk—he’s too embarrassed. He’s been cowering since the shooting started. If word got out, he’d lose face.” Lin Qiaoqiao finally looked up from the gun. “I’m off.”

As she turned to leave, Ah Mei hurried from the kitchen. “Wait! Breakfast is ready. Eat before you go.”

“No need—I ate at home. Share it with those lazybones here. They made me late!” Lin Qiaoqiao retorted, storming out.

Guan Yu shook his head. His rare chance to sleep in had vanished, replaced by Lin Qiaoqiao’s teasing—a poor trade indeed.

Outside Qiaoyuan District’s gates, Lin Qiaoqiao glared at the guards. “Would it kill you to let me drive in? This compound’s absurdly long—you enjoy making people hike?” Though she’d visited before, today’s unannounced arrival in uniform had forced her to park outside.

The guards remained stone-faced, merely nodding as she passed. In her car, Lin Qiaoqiao donned white gloves, meticulously wiping fingerprints from the Desert Eagle—even disassembling the magazine to clean each bullet. A single trace of Guan Yu’s print could end both their careers.

**Chapter 2765: Prime Treatment**

After breakfast, Guan Yu and Xue Jing secured a lawyer before heading to the Fang residence. The Fang father-son duo, held by Wei Hongwei’s men, awaited in the trashed living room—bloodstains and debris littering the space.

The middle-aged Lawyer Liu, recommended by Lü Mei’s mother Yao Yu, adjusted his gray suit nervously. “The Fang family owes me substantial debts,” Guan Yu explained. “We’ve agreed they’ll transfer all assets to settle this. Handle the paperwork.”

“May I review the loan agreements?” Liu asked.

“Agreements? For sums this large?” Guan Yu scoffed. “Draft a legally binding document. The rest isn’t your concern.”

“This requires the Fang family’s official seal and signatures,” Liu hedged.

Guan Yu’s patience thinned. “Prepare the documents. I’ll handle the rest.” He handed over folders detailing Fang properties and investments. “How long?”

“Two hours to review.”

“Do it. We’re on a schedule.” Guan Yu had booked the Fangs’ deportation flight for 3 PM—delays were unacceptable.

Upstairs, Fang Su and his father sat haggard. “Feed them,” Guan Yu ordered Wei Hongwei, who returned with burgers and soda. Guan Yu dangled the food before Patriarch Fang. “Cooperate, and your son lives. Resist…” He trailed off meaningfully.

Fang Su, lips cracked from thirst, devoured the meal while his father watched hungrily. “Dad,” Fang Su mumbled between bites, “we’re already dead men. Why starve? Give him the keys.”

Patriarch Fang finally broke. “Under… under the study’s doormat,” he whispered, tears falling. His life’s work—gone.

**Chapter 2766: The Mysterious Safe**

Beneath the rug’s corner lay two keys—one for the door, another smaller one. The study revealed leather chairs and crowded bookshelves, but no seals. After fruitless searching, Guan Yu’s temper flared. “Check again!”

Behind a calligraphy set on the shelves, Xue Jing found a concealed safe. The tiny key fit perfectly. Inside rested the Fang family seal and documents—their final surrender complete.
