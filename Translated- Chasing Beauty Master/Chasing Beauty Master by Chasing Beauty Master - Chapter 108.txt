The Jin Family was poised for a major upheaval this time, launching an earth-shaking operation! As the vanguard of this campaign, dealing with some brat like this should have been effortless. Crushing such an insignificant whelp carried no pressure whatsoever! Those who dared oppose the Jin Family deserved every misfortune that came their way!

Guan Yu’s fury erupted like lava when the rifle butt struck him. His expression turned murderous as he prepared to activate his gravity manipulation in retaliation. Director Nie swiftly stepped forward, gripping Guan Yu’s arm.

“Don’t be impulsive!” Heaven’s sake, was this lunatic mad? This wasn’t some playground scuffle! With dozens of gun barrels aimed at his head, he still wanted to fight back? The moment he lifted a finger, those triggers would surely be pulled!

Guan Yu glared at Director Li with bloodshot eyes that gleamed demonically under the searchlights, resembling a hellspawn baring its fangs.

“You’re dead.” Guan Yu’s tongue flicked out to taste the blood trickling from his temple to his lips—metallic, salty...

“I’ll keep you company through this long night,” Director Li sneered, utterly dismissive of Guan Yu’s silent threats.

Handcuffed and hooded, Guan Yu was shoved into the police van by two officers. Helpless under another’s roof, he had to bow his head. When rage had surged moments earlier, he’d nearly lunged to pummel that tyrannical, unreasonable Director Li into pulp. But with countless guns trained on him and Director Nie’s restraining grip, cold rationality had prevailed.

Acting now meant suicide—giving them the perfect excuse to end him!

Sitting motionless in the vehicle’s darkness, the hood rendered him blind. Yet when the engine started, the officers flanking him—following Director Li’s unspoken order—suddenly pivoted, hammering fists into his solar plexus and stomach.

Guh...! Guan Yu gritted his teeth, inhaling sharply as he endured. The beating was merely the overture—blow after blow concentrated on his abdomen. These veterans knew precisely where to strike for maximum agony without leaving marks, inflicting only internal damage.

Clenching his jaw, Guan Yu leaned back against the seat, fists balled, motionless and silent through the onslaught. Minutes later, the panting officers wiped sweat from their brows, staring in shock at their unflinching target.

“Fuck, did we kill him?” Their faces paled as they yanked off Guan Yu’s hood.

The youth’s pallid face twisted into a ghastly smile, crimson eyes boring into them with death’s promise. In the van’s gloom, Guan Yu memorized their features with unnatural clarity. Unless this arrest ended in his execution... retribution would come.

“Oho! What a tough nut! Didn’t make a peep through all that!” A officer adjusted his collar, leaning close to whisper, “We’ll tenderize you properly back at the station.”

Ptui! Guan Yu spat in his face.

“You fucking找死!” Enraged, the cop gripped Guan Yu’s jaw, elbow slamming repeatedly into his gut. “Keep enduring! How dare you mess with the Jin heirs? Got a death wish?!”

Ah... So they were Jin Family lackeys! Now it made sense—Director Li and these special “hospitality” officers were all here because of Jin Cheng and Jin Xing!

Trouble indeed. Director Nie’s intervention had been ignored. These officers answered to Director Li. Tonight would be... challenging.

Chapter 263: Rebirth and Transformation

As Guan Yu was hauled away, Fang Zhe drove into the villa district with subordinates.

“What’s with all the police cars? Major operation?” He eyed the passing convoy curiously.

Minutes later, he called his superior in shock.

“What? The young man was arrested? Why?”

“Not sure... It just happened. We passed the convoy entering.”

“Understood. Return now.” The old man’s voice turned grave.

Hooded and handcuffed, Guan Yu was led into a dim interrogation room. Removing the hood revealed sparse furnishings—a table, chairs, iron stool. The sole window cast feeble light from two meters up.

Director Li glared across the table while Director Nie watched with resigned concern.

“Guan Yu. Explain tonight’s gang gathering.” Director Li’s interrogation lacked finesse, leaving the stenographer confused.

“Gathering? Don’t follow.” Guan Yu leaned back casually.

“Cooperate! Even iron jaws break here! Name the gangs, reason for assembly, firearms source!”

Guan Yu smirked. “No idea what you’re on about.”

“Stop playing dumb! Two minutes to reconsider!” Li slammed the table, looming threateningly.

“Threatening a suspect? How illegal.”

“Think you’re tough?!” Li signaled subordinates brandishing electric batons.

Crackling blue arcs danced as the officers pressed electrodes to Guan Yu’s sides.

One second... two... ten...

Instead of convulsing, Guan Yu’s eyes widened in shock—then exhilaration. The copper coin in his mind hummed joyfully, voraciously absorbing the current. Muscles and bones reforged under surging energy.

“Comfortable... damn!” Guan Yu gasped euphorically.

“Insolent punk!” Li roared as batons died. “Bring more!”

Four fresh batons discharged into Guan Yu. The coin spun faster, blue tendrils coursing through him. Power exploded—muscles swelled, strength quintupling. He could’ve shattered the iron stool with a punch!

Li’s face purpled with rage. Testing a baton himself, he got electrocuted. “Fucking bastard!”

“Trying suicide?” Guan Yu mocked.

“I’ll skin you alive!” Li reached for his gun.

“Director Li, calm!” Nie intervened.

“Out of my way! I’ll—”

“Fight me then!” Guan Yu taunted, raising cuffed hands. “I’ll handicap myself!”

“Who brawls here?!” Li spat.

As stalemate ensued, Nie whispered a plan—sleep deprivation torture.

“Your men watch him!” Li ordered, distrusting Nie.

Alone with guards, Guan Yu savored his metamorphosis. The copper coin’s energy had reshaped him—a phoenix reborn from electric ashes.

Chapter 264: Who Fights Fair?

Director Li never imagined Guan Yu’s secret—the coin’s ravenous hunger for electricity. Each jolt enhanced him further, muscles thrumming with leonine power.

Four more batons depleted. Guan Yu remained unshaken.

“Is this... possible?!” Li checked functional batons on himself—and got shocked again.

“Fucking lunatic!” Guan Yu laughed at Li’s self-electrocution.

“I’ll execute you!” Li drew his pistol.

“Director Li!” Nie restrained him.

Guan Yu smirked. “Too scared for a fair fight?”

“This isn’t a damn martial arts novel!” Li stormed out, leaving guards to begin the sleepless vigil.

But Guan Yu’s transformation was complete. The coin’s energy pulsed through him—a sleeping dragon awakened, ready to unleash storm and fury.
