“What a joke!” The man surnamed Gao bellowed. Though he had not wished for matters to come to this, there was no choice now but to force their hand. “Listen well!” he roared, unwilling to waste further time. “The man who brings me Prince Zou’s head shall have gold and beauties beyond measure—this I swear by my rank as centurion! Archers, nock your arrows—”

To Guan Yu’s dismay, violence seemed inevitable. “Even if you defeat a thousand enemies, you’ll lose eight hundred of your own!” he urgently countered. “What use is silver, be it a hundred or ten thousand taels, if you’re dead to spend it?”

Unbeknownst to the crowd, Wang Jun had already maneuvered to the right flank during the chaos. Now concealed beside the enemy archers, his carefully chosen position offered lethal advantage. The neatly arrayed bowmen stood in two disciplined rows—a formation Wang’s crossbow bolt could pierce through multiple targets simultaneously, creating bloody havoc to clear an escape route for the prince.

As Guan Yu scanned the scene, he noted Commander Gao’s men drawing blades behind their leader. “Loose!” came the thunderous order.

Though shaken, the trained soldiers and Imperial Guards responded instantly. A deadly hail of arrows descended. Guan Yu threw himself back to shield the carriage where Prince Zou huddled—fortunately, the narrow windows offered protection as shafts clattered harmlessly against the vehicle.

The assault came from left and rear flanks. While several city guard soldiers fell wounded behind the carriage, the prince remained unscathed. On the right flank, Wang Jun’s first bolt tore through four skulls in a grisly fountain of blood and bone, leaving survivors paralyzed with terror.

“Third Captain, attack the rear!” Zou Wuhui commanded as chaos erupted. Wang Jun’s second bolt, though only claiming two victims this time, shattered enemy formation completely. Seizing the moment, he charged forward to kick down several foes while Xiao Zhi and Zou Wuhui hauled the prince from the carriage onto a waiting horse.

As the trio galloped rightward, Zou Wuxiao drove the empty carriage leftward to draw enemy fire. “Slaughter them all!” Commander Gao’s saber flashed high—a weapon Guan Yu recognized from the noodle shop assassins, confirming Imperial Guard involvement.

Facing twenty charging foes with only two captains at his back, Guan Yu shouted, “To the prince! Guard his escape!” The trio raced after Zou Wuxiao’s decoy carriage now careening wildly toward enemy lines. When archers abandoned bows for blades, Guan Yu glanced back to see Third Captain’s men falling rapidly to Imperial Guards.

Ahead, the prince’s group had gained distance. Guan Yu focused on protecting Zou Wuxiao, who recklessly charged the enemy ranks until his carriage lodged against a tree. As Zou tumbled into combat, Guan Yu and the captains arrived. “No lingering!” Guan Yu barked. First Captain yanked Zou Wuxiao onto his saddle as they fled.

Their pursuers halted, leaderless after Guan Yu’s crossbow bolt sent Commander Gao tumbling from his mount. Third Captain’s fate remained uncertain as the survivors pressed onward.

“We’ll reunite at Proud Heaven Manor,” Guan Yu panted as their exhausted horses slowed. Zou Wuxiao pressed about the mysterious intervention during the fight, but Guan Yu remained cryptic. “Even His Highness shan’t know this secret.”

When they finally sighted the manor, its tranquil gardens belied coming storms. The unprepared steward gaped at Prince Zou’s arrival. “Why no warning, Your Highness?”

“My messengers never reached you,” the prince replied grimly. As they entered the modest hall, Guan Yu noted the manor’s defenses—wealthy but vulnerable. Steward Hao’s effusive welcome couldn’t mask the peril: Imperial Guards would surely track them here.

“My life is yours to command,” the steward vowed, oblivious to the danger his hospitality invited. Guan Yu hid a grimace—this peaceful estate was now marked for destruction, its fate tied to a prince fleeing shadows.
