“Madam, last night’s intruder clearly had motives beyond merely killing a few guards. I believe there must be a deeper scheme at play. We must swiftly recruit replacements to bolster the manor’s defenses. If the culprit returns while our numbers are diminished, we may be overwhelmed,” Steward Sun advised, observing Madam Qin’s reaction.

“You’re absolutely right. Handle this matter immediately. With sixteen guards lost, recruit twice that number to reinforce our security,” Madam Qin commanded.

A faint smile flickered across Steward Sun’s face. “As you wish, Madam. I shall begin at dawn.”

Guan Yu couldn’t shake the suspicion that Steward Sun’s composure masked ulterior motives. Yet without concrete evidence, he resolved to remain vigilant and counter whatever schemes might arise.

After Steward Sun departed, Guan Yu approached Madam Qin. “Auntie, I discovered something peculiar on the guards’ bodies earlier.” He handed her a tuft of crimson fur. “Several bore this same substance. Do you recognize it?”

Madam Qin examined the unusual fur. “Fox fur,” Guan Yu stated plainly. “No mortal could have slain so many guards undetected. This suggests supernatural involvement.”

“You mean…” Madam Qin’s voice trembled with dawning comprehension.

“Thank you for trusting my judgment,” Guan Yu replied.

“Nonsense! You’re Xiao Zhi’s sworn brothers and trusted friends. Having witnessed your character these past weeks, I’ve no doubt of your integrity. With this crisis unfolding, you’re the only ones I can rely upon.” Fear laced Madam Qin’s words. She knew Guan Yu and his companions possessed extraordinary abilities—their aid might prove crucial in weathering this storm.

“I believe a fox demon infiltrated the manor,” Guan Yu declared. “Though its purpose remains unclear, extreme caution is warranted.”

“A fox demon?” Madam Qin gasped.

Xiao Zhi nodded eagerly. “Last night near the rock garden, we saw it transform into human form! Its eyes glowed crimson in the dark, and it bore a long fox tail when its disguise slipped.”

“You witnessed this and said nothing?” Madam Qin demanded.

Guan Yu shot Xiao Zhi an exasperated look. The man’s loose tongue had complicated matters. “We feared alerting the creature,” he explained. “Never imagined it would strike so viciously.”

“Can you devise a way to expose this demon?”

Guan Yu hesitated. “Only when it next attacks can we identify it. Until then, vigilance is our sole defense.”

“Then we must have Steward Sun recruit more guards immediately!” Madam Qin insisted.

Though Guan Yu distrusted the steward, openly opposing him risked alienating Madam Qin. “We’ll intervene when the demon strikes again,” he conceded.

“My daughter Yu’er has been sent to safety, but Jin’er remains bedridden. I entrust our protection to you,” Madam Qin pleaded.

“Rest assured, Auntie! We’ll guard you with our lives!” Xiao Zhi vowed.

In the Demonic Soul Sect’s stronghold, the Demon Lord pondered a chessboard’s incomplete strategy when the Green Dragon Left Envoy approached. “My Lord, scouts have located Duobao Mountain’s entrance within the Qin Manor’s rock garden. Our agents will infiltrate disguised as guards tonight.”

“So soon? Ensure no missteps. What of Guan Yu’s group?”

“They remain at the manor. We’ll devise a distraction to draw them away.”

At the City Lord’s residence, the Left Envoy presented himself as a merchant. After bribing a guard with silver, he gained audience with Lord Men.

“Your recent crackdown on outsiders greatly benefited my struggling business,” the envoy feigned gratitude. “I humbly request its continuation.”

Lord Men frowned. “I apprehended troublemakers, not to aid merchants. Arbitrary arrests would breed panic.”

Leaning closer, the envoy whispered, “Rebel factions still lurk in disguise, plotting against you.” He produced a gold bar. “Merely maintain patrols under the pretense of search operations...”

Lord Men’s resolve wavered as the gold glittered. “Very well. Patrols resume tomorrow.”

Tasked with retrieving Wang Xiaorong, the Left Envoy wandered Qujiang City’s bustling streets. His search led him to Echo Pavilion, where courtesan-musicians caught his attention—particularly their subtle cultivation auras.

As he ascended to private chambers, courtesan Xi Liu spotted him and urgently warned colleague Cui Hua: “The Demon Lord’s Left Envoy approaches! Entertain him without revealing our true identities!”

“Welcome, young master,” Cui Hua purred, guiding the envoy to a secluded room. “Shall we enhance your evening with wine and... diversions?”

Unaware of the honey trap, the Left Envoy smiled. “A splendid proposal.”

Elsewhere, West Willow sighed in her hidden chamber. “This sanctuary is compromised. We must relocate after this encounter.” The game of shadows deepened, all players unaware of the intricate web entangling them.
