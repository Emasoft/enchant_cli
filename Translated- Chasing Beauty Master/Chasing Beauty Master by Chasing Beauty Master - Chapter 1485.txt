“Magistrate Pang, I’ve been contemplating your intentions,” Guan Yu said, his tone measured. “I fail to grasp the meaning behind your efforts. Let me be clear: I have no desire to partake in these lavish preparations. There’s no need to ‘improve’ things simply because I’m here. Do you truly believe the fare in Qujiang City’s City Lord Manor pales in comparison to what you’ve laid out?”

Magistrate Pang, who had meticulously arranged this feast to impress Young Master Jiang, felt as though he’d been slapped. His carefully curated spread now seemed absurdly excessive.

“Young Master Jiang,” he replied, forcing a deferential smile, “how could I possibly serve humble fare to someone of your stature? That would be far too casual.”

At that moment, Wang Jun entered from outside. Guan Yu waved him over. “Join us. Magistrate Pang has prepared a mountain of delicacies. It’d be a shame to let them go to waste.”

As Wang Jun approached, he reported, “Young Master, everything outside is ready. The carriage awaits at the gate. We may depart whenever you wish.”

Guan Yu nodded. “No rush. Let’s eat first. I slept poorly last night—perhaps the unfamiliar surroundings unsettled me. After filling our stomachs, I’ll rest properly in the carriage.”

Magistrate Pang exhaled inwardly. He’d feared Guan Yu might prolong his stay, but it seemed the young lord was resolved to leave promptly.

Meanwhile, Young Master Li, having idly wandered the streets, returned to the yamen. If Guan Yu departed today, he’d need to hasten his “education” of the slaves. The guards, recognizing him, offered no resistance. Yet Li halted abruptly at the sight of a familiar carriage parked at the yamen’s entrance.

Circling the vehicle, he muttered, “This is my carriage! Why is it here? Has Father come?”

The thought chilled him. If Old Master Li had business with Magistrate Pang, a confrontation loomed. Li had no desire to face his father’s reproach over the recent incident—the maidservant he’d forced himself upon, only to accidentally kill during one of his brutal episodes. The ensuing quarrel had driven him from home for over ten days.

Now, torn between avoiding his father and seizing the chance to befriend Guan Yu, Li hesitated at the threshold. “Has Old Master Li arrived?” he demanded of the guards.

The newly posted soldiers exchanged glances. “We haven’t seen him,” one admitted.

“None of you noticed?” Li scoffed. “I’ll see for myself.” Swaggering inside, he expected to find his father in the reception hall. Instead, the room stood empty.

Upon learning Magistrate Pang was breakfasting in the rear chambers, Li’s curiosity deepened. Could his father be dining with the magistrate?

When Li barged into the private dining room, Wang Jun immediately bristled. “Who are you? By what right do you intrude?”

Guan Yu’s mind raced. This was the same Li whose carriage he’d appropriated while posing as a Luo family scion. Had the ruse been uncovered?

“Magistrate Pang,” Li began, ignoring Wang Jun, “is my father here?” His casual address and lack of courtesy raised Wang Jun’s suspicions—was this the magistrate’s son?

Magistrate Pang, flustered by the intrusion, hurried to mediate. “Allow me to introduce you! Young Master Jiang, this is Second Young Master Li of the Li family—the wealthiest household in our town. His father, Old Master Li, is a renowned merchant.”

Li turned oily charm toward Guan Yu. “Ah, the illustrious son of City Lord Jiang! I’ve visited Qujiang City—such prosperity under your father’s governance!”

“You flatter erroneously,” Guan Yu deflected. “Qujiang thrived long before my father’s tenure. We claim no undue credit.”

Undeterred, Li pressed on with hollow praises until Guan Yu excused himself to depart. As they reached the carriage, Li’s eyes narrowed.

“Magistrate Pang,” he murmured, “do you not find it odd that Young Master Jiang rides in my carriage?”

“Your father gifted it to him,” the magistrate explained. “Young Master Jiang’s original transport broke down en route. When he learned of your family’s standing, he paid a visit. Old Master Li deemed the carriage fitting for his status.”

Li’s jaw tightened. Though unsettled, he shrugged. “A mere carriage. Let the瘟神 depart. But I should return home—Father likely knows I’ve been here all along.”

“He’s known for weeks,” Magistrate Pang admitted. “That’s why he never searched for you.”

“You both deceived me?!” Li exploded.

“You never asked!” the magistrate protested. “And rest assured—your... activities here remain secret.”

As Guan Yu’s carriage rolled away, tensions simmered beneath the morning calm.
