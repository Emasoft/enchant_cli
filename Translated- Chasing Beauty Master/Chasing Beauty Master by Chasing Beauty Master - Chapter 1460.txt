“I’m worried about Xiao Zhi’s safety. Could you do me a favor?” Guan Yu said.

“Just tell me. I’ll agree to anything you ask,” Wang Xiaorong replied firmly. To her, Guan Yu’s concerns were her own—she’d go through fire and water for him.

“Use your informants within the Yunqing Sect to investigate Xiao Zhi’s situation. After all, he’s my closest friend here.”

Wang Xiaorong chuckled. “Is that all? Don’t worry—leave it to me. I’ll get every detail about Xiao Zhi for you. But there’s something else you should know: the Yunqing Sect is currently conducting an internal audit. No one knows why.”

“Oh? An audit? How?”

“Each peak’s leader is tallying their disciples—not just juniors, but everyone. They’re submitting name lists to Xuanming. So far, they’ve done two headcounts. Xuanming declared that only those on the lists are recognized as Yunqing Sect members. Anyone omitted will be expelled on sight.”

Guan Yu fell silent, pondering Xuanming’s motives. What was he plotting?

Wang Xiaorong added, “Don’t overthink it. I suspect he wants to lure you back, expose the Eight-Sided Drum Technique within you, and brand you a traitor for colluding with demonic sects—a grave crime.”

“Returning now would only confirm my ‘treason.’ It’s infuriating,” Guan Yu muttered. “All because of that scum Yan Zhao. His scheming ruined everything.”

Wang Xiaorong brightened. “I have an idea! What if Father extracts the Eight-Sided Drum Technique from you? Once it’s gone, you could return to the Yunqing Sect without fear. They’d find nothing during inspections. What do you think?”

Guan Yu hesitated. Though her plan sounded reasonable, dangers lurked. If the Demon Lord obtained the technique, the consequences could be catastrophic. Moreover, the technique was currently clashing with the seal in his mind—any disturbance might kill him. Brain matters were perilous to meddle with.

Misreading his silence as refusal, Wang Xiaorong pressed, “I know you fear Father gaining the technique, but this is our only option. Otherwise, you’ll remain a fugitive.”

Her motives were pure: she longed for Guan Yu to stay by her side forever.

**Chapter 3805: A Difficult Dilemma**

Though part of her wished Guan Yu would defect to the Demon Soul Sect, Wang Xiaorong knew forced loyalty would bring neither of them happiness. “Guan Yu, I understand your reservations. But keeping the technique only harms you. Why protect it when the Yunqing Sect already sees you as a traitor?”

“It’s not about loyalty. The technique itself isn’t valuable to me. My concern is survival—whether the extraction can be done safely, especially with the seal in my mind. The two forces are locked in stalemate. Any imbalance could trigger a fatal clash. Remember when I nearly went berserk? San Tou saved me then.”

Wang Xiaorong paled. “I’d forgotten! This complicates things… What if we consult Father? If he’s confident, we proceed. If not, we find another way. Your safety comes first.”

“I trust you completely,” Guan Yu said. “But I can’t entrust my life to the Demon Lord. There’s no security in his hands.”

“Not even with my guarantee?”

“I believe *you*, but not him. His intentions are unpredictable.”

“Without removing the technique, you’ll never clear your name. The righteous sects won’t show mercy,” she warned.

“I know it’s a thorny path—for you, the Demon Lord, and me. But reality is rarely simple.”

**Chapter 3806: A Flash of Inspiration**

Wang Xiaorong persisted, “Father admires you! He’s desperate to recruit a rare dual cultivator of martial and demonic arts. He once said you’d be killed if unwilling to serve the Demon Soul Sect. But I stopped him—no, wait. *He* chose to spare you, valuing your talent too much to waste. You needn’t distrust him so.”

Despite her earnestness, Guan Yu remained wary. The Demon Lord’s mercurial nature made him unreliable. If only Zhijianyu Lang were here—his cunning could devise an escape plan.

“I’ll think on it. There might be another solution,” Guan Yu said.

Wang Xiaorong sighed, resting her chin on her hands. “If only we could mask the technique’s energy…”

Guan Yu’s eyes lit up. “Wait! The Emperor’s Seal’s artifact spirit—a powerful soul entity. What if we store the technique there? The Yunqing Sect would never detect it.”

“Is that possible?” Wang Xiaorong frowned. “Artifact spirits are common in high-grade treasures, but they’re sealed within. How could it absorb your energy?”

“When the seal recognized me, I met its spirit—a arrogant being subdued only by the Supreme Realm mark in me. Later, I realized it had been siphoning my cultivation energy. If it can drain my灵力, perhaps it can take the Eight-Sided Drum Technique too!”

**Chapter 3807: Trial and Error**

“Incredible! Try it now—I’ll guard you,” Wang Xiaorong urged.

Though uncertain, Guan Yu preferred risking the artifact spirit’s whims over the Demon Lord’s treachery. The latter’s hunger for the technique was no secret; only Wang Xiaorong’s influence stayed his hand.

In the Demon Soul Sect, Guan Yu slept with one eye open, distrusting the Demon Lord’s shadowy schemes. Success here meant safety—the technique hidden, undetectable.

Settling cross-legged on his bed, Guan Yu gripped the Emperor’s Seal. His consciousness plunged into its mist-shrouded realm, calling, “Show yourself! I have a task.”

A lion-headed fog figure materialized. “Master, your command? Have you come to chastise me for absorbing your灵力?”

“No. I offer a potent energy—the Eight-Sided Drum Technique. Can you extract it without disturbing the opposing seal in my mind?”

“Easily! With the two forces at war, the seal will aid my extraction to claim dominance. Proceed?”

Guan Yu nodded. “Gently. Halt at any sign of danger.”

Cold tendrils seeped into his skull as sweat drenched his body. Wang Xiaorong fretted, dabbing his brow with her sleeve.

Internally, Guan Yu observed the artifact spirit negotiating with the technique. The clashing energies stabilized, the seal tacitly assisting the spirit’s advance.

“Master, success is near,” the spirit murmured.

But as Wang Xiaorong nearly fled for help, Guan Yu exhaled sharply—his robes soaked, yet unharmed.

“Guan Yu? Are you alright?”

He opened his eyes, grinning weakly. “It… worked.”
