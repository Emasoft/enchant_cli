Guanyu and Siqi sat on the somewhat damp wooden pallet. Though moist, it remained tolerable. Having recently relocated to this higher position long untouched by rain, the wooden platform felt far less soggy than their previous spot.

"Perhaps this is how we'll spend the entire night. We're fortunate," Guanyu remarked. "Experiencing such weather shifts here counts as valuable training."

Aze approached, saying, "If not for you, we wouldn't be this comfortable even now. The only regret is our clothes remaining damp—otherwise, it'd be perfect."

Many shared Aze's sentiment. Indeed, clinging wet garments brought profound discomfort.

Wang Jun patted Aze's shoulder. "Be grateful. Remember how terrified we were earlier? Had Guanyu not reached our tent in time, we'd all be dead now—no chance to even complain here."

**Chapter 4559: Protection**

"Heh, you're right," Aze chuckled. "Without Guanyu's alertness, we might've met our Ancestral Master by now."

Their exchange stirred silent gratitude among many sect brothers, though some retained biases against Guanyu. Those close to Lin Chen—now abandoned—nursed resentment, while others loyal to Ling Su resented his expulsion. Yet many acknowledged Guanyu as their savior: without him, they'd have perished in the tornado or endured the storm unprotected.

Conflicting emotions swirled—gratitude from some, envy and blame from others. Some muttered that as leader, Guanyu should've acted sooner to spare their suffering.

Guanyu knew of these undercurrents. He tolerated unvoiced dissent, but any open defiance—especially from Lin Chen or Ling Su's factions—would meet immediate expulsion. He brooked no disloyalty, no lenience for troublemakers.

His thoughts drifted to Ling Su, who'd vanished after the Ha Clan's turmoil. Had the storm claimed him? Guanyu cared little for the man's fate but remained wary—Ling Su's cunning mind could plot unseen mischief.

The night stretched long. Though they'd nibbled rations, hunger gnawed at most. Survival now depended on enduring until dawn's reprieve.

Guanyu sat cross-legged, one arm around Siqi, the other gripping his Soulfall Blade. Vigilant against weather shifts, he remained ready to summon protective barriers instantly.

Siqi whispered, "If the weather clears tomorrow, what's our plan?"

Guanyu had pondered this. Though supplies and camels were lost, their acquaintance with Xiaomei—greedy serpent and Jiayi Sect leader—offered hope. Silver could buy tents, provisions, even camels.

"The hundreds of taels from Master will prove useful now," he replied. "We'll restock through Xiaomei's sect. Despite being desert dwellers, they'll trade for silver."

"But won't she extort us?" Siqi worried. "She'll demand exorbitant prices knowing our desperation."

Guanyu lacked infinite funds but remained unfazed. If Xiaomei overcharged, he'd seek alternatives—returning to the Ha Clan or other tribes. "Worst case, we march on wooden sandals. No one starves or thirsts under my watch."

Siqi nodded, relying wholly on his leadership.

Huddled together for warmth, the group weathered the drizzle without barriers now. Some dozed back-to-back; Wang Jun sprawled comfortably despite the damp planks.

"Why sleep when dawn's two watches away?" Aze prodded. "Study your iron fan instead—might discover something."

**Chapter 4560: Negotiations**

"Exhausted," Wang Jun yawned, cushioning himself with spare cloth. "Rest fuels tomorrow's work. You meditate—I'll dream."

Aze shook his head. "I'll cultivate. Restores energy faster than sleep."

Most chose cultivation—practical in this humidity. But Wang Jun, ever lax in training, prioritized comfort over discipline. Had natural talent not buoyed him, he'd rank lowest in Yunqing Sect.

Dawn finally broke, sunlight banishing the storm's remnants. Though three companions remained missing—fate uncertain—relief prevailed.

Guanyu rose stiffly. "Walk with me, Siqi. Dry in the morning sun."

They climbed a wind-sculpted dune where Xiaomei materialized. "Your makeshift tent served well," she remarked, eyeing their triangular windbreak. "But destroying clothes? How will you proceed?"

Guanyu shrugged. "Your sect can provide replacements. Let's discuss necessities." He gestured uphill. "We'll talk under sunrise."

At the summit, warmth bathed them as Guanyu broached the critical issue. "The storm took our camels. Your sect has spares?"

Xiaomei feigned hesitation. "Camels are precious here. I can lend you one—for yourself alone."

"Unacceptable," Guanyu countered. "My sect brothers won't walk while I ride. Lend us enough, and I'll return double later."

"Impossible!" she protested. "Jiayi Sect lacks so many!"

Guanyu called her bluff. "Then we'll buy from the Ha Clan. What's a camel's price here? Fifty taels? Sixty?"

Xiaomei's eyes narrowed at the bait.

**Chapter 4561: Exorbitant Prices**

Guanyu pressed, "Partners should aid each other. Without camels, we hinder the search for Miao City."

"One camel's my limit," Xiaomei insisted, smirking at Siqi. "For old friendship's sake."

Guanyu scoffed. "Then we'll procure elsewhere. Silver opens desert paths."

Xiaomei's gaze darted, calculating losses versus gains. Jiayi Sect's camel reserves were ample, but revealing this weakened her bargaining power.

"Perhaps... two hundred taels each," she tested.

"Preposterous!" Siqi exclaimed. Common prices ranged twenty-thirty taels.

Guanyu smiled coldly. "Greed blinds. We'll seek fair dealers." Turning, he added, "The Ha Clan remembers favors."

As they descended, Xiaomei's voice chased them. "Wait! Let's... reconsider."

The game continued—a dance of need versus avarice under the desert sun.
