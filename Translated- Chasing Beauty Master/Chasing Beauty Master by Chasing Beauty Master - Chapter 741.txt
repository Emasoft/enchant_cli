Wei Hongwei stared blankly at Guan Yu. “Of course, my feelings for you are like those for an elder brother. Could it be you still don’t trust me?”

Guan Yu currently found it hard to trust anyone. With so many chaotic events unfolding, he wasn’t sure who to rely on anymore—trustworthy allies were far too scarce. “If I didn’t trust you, I wouldn’t have called you here. There’s something critical I need you to investigate for me, and it must remain absolutely confidential.”

“No problem. Whatever Brother Guan asks, I, Wei Hongwei, will give it my all.”

Guan Yu nodded. “First, send people to tail Liu Shuowei. Find out what he’s been up to lately. Choose reliable subordinates—don’t embarrass me with sloppy work.”

“Easy enough,” Wei Hongwei replied promptly.

“Also, do you know any organizations related to supernatural beings or assassins?”

Wei Hongwei shook his head. “Brother Guan, as you know, non-cultivators can’t easily enter cultivator circles. Without any cultivation base, we’d just be looked down upon. So I’m not familiar with those circles. But I’ve heard of many such groups—not just supernatural ones. Nowadays, both lawful and underworld organizations abound. If you have money, they’ll work for you. Why do you ask?”

His words made sense. Normally, cultivators and ordinary people inhabited different worlds, even while sharing the same planet.

Guan Yu suddenly remembered someone else he could consult—Hou Jinshun. “Hongwei, help me gather information on the most prominent and powerful organizations. Find their contact details and report back. And today’s matters must stay secret—even from Lü Mei.”

He emphasized this because Lü Mei often pried information about him from Wei Hongwei, who crumbled under her slightest smile.

Wei Hongwei nodded. Guan Yu added sternly, “Show some backbone! How can a grown man be defeated by a smile? If Lü Mei asks about me again, dodge her questions. If you can’t evade, invent plausible lies. Understood?”

“Got it. But why hide things from Lü Mei? She’s your woman! Besides, surrounded by beauties like you are, your resistance is strong. But I’m still single! I was hoping she’d introduce me to someone—that’s why I’ve been honest. I’m just currying favor.”

Wei Hongwei grumbled that promised matchmaking attempts had yet to materialize.

“Regardless, never tell her the truth about my affairs from now on. I trust no one these days.”

As they walked back to the classroom, Guan Yu asked, “By the way, what’s the background of Wang Bo, who founded the Brotherhood?”

“Wang Bo’s a senior at Kaihuang High. Over a decade ago, the Wang family should’ve been among A City’s Five Great Families. Back then, during the clan wars, most Wangs mysteriously died overnight. Their assets were seized by shareholders, leaving only Wang Bo and his mother. She now runs a small restaurant with decent income.”

“Over a decade ago? The Wang massacre coincided with the clan conflicts. What about Zhang Han’s origins?”

Wei Hongwei’s account deepened Guan Yu’s curiosity. Yang Kunlun once mentioned Zhang Han’s family being slaughtered by assassins fifteen years ago, leaving only the infant Zhang Han, whom Yang raised.

Both Wang Bo and Zhang Han’s families were exterminated—could there be a connection? Was the perpetrator the same? Likely one of today’s Four Great Families, having risen by crushing others.

Wei Hongwei added, “When Zhang Han first came to Kaihuang, her striking looks made me investigate. All I learned was her relation to the Yangs—nothing else.”

These remained conjectures without evidence. Only survivors could explain the Wang and Zhang family tragedies.

Returning to class, Lü Mei unexpectedly summoned Wei Hongwei. “Hongwei, come with me after school. I’ll introduce you to a beauty.”

“Yes!” Wei Hongwei jumped for joy, thanking both Lü Mei and Guan Yu.

Guan Yu wondered what girl Lü Mei had in mind. Wei Hongwei’s affluent family—prominent in A City’s logistics sector—deserved a worthy match.

Wei Hongwei fidgeted all afternoon before skipping class to shop for new相亲 attire.

After school, Guan Yu drove his Da Hang home to change. As Wei Hongwei’s friend, he needed presentable clothes—no school uniforms for相亲.

At home, Ah Mei prepared an elegant white casual suit after hearing of the dinner plans.

En route to the相亲 venue, Guan Yu detoured to Huaye Club to meet Hou Jinshun, arriving early.

Hou Jinshun personally supervised renovations. “Guan Yu! What brings you here?”

“Needing your help and checking progress.” Guan Yu admired the club’s majestic exterior, its design subtly forming the character “生” (life). Impressive craftsmanship.

“Progress is smooth with round-the-clock work. Exteriors are done; interiors near completion. A month’s project will finish in twenty days.”

Hou Jinshun’s loyalty stemmed not just from Guan Yu’s ties to Yang Conghan, but from life-changing mentorship. Though somewhat crude, Hou valued loyalty above all.

At a nearby restaurant, Guan Yu asked abruptly, “What do you know about the Yangs?”

Hou blinked. “Only what’s common knowledge—they lead A City’s Four Great Families. Yang Conghan’s the city’s top beauty. Why?”

Useless. “At Huaye, you meet elites. Do you know organizations of experts-for-hire?”

“Plenty exist—varying in scale and price. Remember Han Qiao? He joined one. Drunk once, he mentioned their strict hierarchy—he’d never seen the leader.”

Guan Yu pressed, “How contact powerful groups? I need help with something棘手.”

“Each has external liaisons. Contact them for deals—but leaders stay hidden. Oh! That guy you beat at Mike’s Bar? He’s a liaison.”

New intel. Mike’s warranted another visit.

At the相亲 venue—a western restaurant near Lü Mei’s home—Wei Hongwei waited anxiously. Dressed in a tailored beige outfit, he looked sharp despite his round face.

Spotting Guan Yu’s dapper appearance, Wei groaned, “Brother Guan! This is my相亲! You’re upstaging me!”

Guan Yu chuckled. “I’m enhancing your prestige. Would校服suit this occasion?”

Entering the luxe private room with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the street, Guan Yu froze—the view clearly showed Lü Mei’s mansion. Two black vans identical to those stalking Zhang Han were parked inside.

His mind raced. Were the Lü family involved? The vans—uncommon modified imports—were typically used by wealthy households for保镖transport. Wei Hongwei confirmed many clans owned such vehicles.

As Guan Yu pondered whether this was clue or coincidence, Lü Mei arrived with her friend Qian Yaoyao—a sporty, bright-eyed beauty who instantly charmed Wei Hongwei.

Chapter 1881: Suspicions

“Meet my闺蜜Qian Yaoyao. This is Wei Hongwei, today’s bachelor, and Guan Yu, my boyfriend.” Lü Mei introduced.

Qian’s lively demeanor and polite greeting pleased Wei Hongwei immensely. Yet Guan Yu’s attention lingered on those black vans across the street—and the unsettling possibility that Lü Mei’s choice of venue wasn’t accidental.
