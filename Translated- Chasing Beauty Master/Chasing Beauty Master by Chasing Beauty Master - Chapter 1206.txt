“Every cultivator’s practiced spells carry an elemental attribute, primarily determined by the cultivation mantras they follow and influenced by their personal constitution. Only after learning foundational spellcraft does one discern which elemental path suits them best.

The world hosts myriad attributes. Common ones include metal, wood, water, fire, earth, wind, lightning, poison, light, and darkness—though the first five dominate. Yet the vastness of existence ensures endless peculiarities.

**Chapter 3095: Give Me a Reason**

These five elements represent but a fraction for most cultivators. Each branches into countless sub-attributes. For instance, while one water-aligned cultivator may conjure tinted water, another’s might flow transparent—a distinction born of differing cultivation methods.

Rarer attributes hinge on both technique and constitution. A body ill-suited to water spells will stagnate even with supreme mantras, never achieving mastery.

Typically, a cultivator channels only one element. Exceptions—those wielding multiple—are rare prodigies, veritable defy-the-heavens geniuses.

As the lightning-wreathed circle in the sky descended, the crowd anticipated the great tree below being charred to cinders.

Suddenly, a tempest erupted, whipping sand and stones into a blinding haze. Second to Wolf, suspecting the village chief’s trickery, nearly slit the man’s throat—until he noticed the chief’s own spell dissolving as the gale buffeted him.

Abandoning the chief, Second to Wolf rushed to guard Guan Yu.

The storm vanished as swiftly as it came. When the dust settled, a figure stood beneath the sacred tree—a cultivator in celestial blue robes, poised like an ancient hero.

None saw his arrival. Guan Yu whispered, “Brother Second—did he emerge from the tree?”

Overhearing, the uncle-in-law dropped to his knees, kowtowing. “A celestial descends! Bless this humble one!” The crowd followed suit—save the chief and white-haired elder, who stood unmoved.

Second to Wolf scrutinized the intact tree. “He didn’t emerge from it. A wind cultivator, surely. That storm was his doing—to halt the chief’s spell.”

Ignoring the prostrating villagers, the newcomer addressed the tree: “Though this ancient one bears guilt, it now threatens none. Why destroy it?”

“Who are you?” the white-haired elder demanded.

“My identity matters not. A millennium this tree has stood here, harmless. What justifies its eradication?”

Guan Yu retorted, “Harmless? Its venom transforms victims into monsters, with inheritable taint. See that man? Cursed by ancestry. Still claim it’s benign?”

“Avoid contact, keep distance, and no harm befalls you,” the stranger countered.

“Why tolerate a removable threat?” Guan Yu pressed. “It leeches this land’s spiritual energy, draining water, soil nutrients, and air’s essence. Once rich in qi, our ancestors settled here. Now, depletions stunted even trees. The chief’s lineage nears extinction because cultivation falters without ambient energy. Give me one reason to spare this parasite!”

The chief interjected, “Esteemed immortal—might you hail from Cloud Azure Mountain’s western peaks?”

“Indeed. This village elder has discernment. I am Tian of Cloud Azure Mountain.”

“Immortal Tian,” the chief continued, “though ancient, this toxic tree endangers us. Removing it may restore our prosperity.”

Guan Yu’s earlier argument had swayed him: the tree’s insatiable consumption crippled their spiritual heritage. Revival required its destruction.

Villagers gaped—their chief supporting an outsider over a celestial?

Unfamiliar with Cloud Azure Mountain, Guan Yu glanced west where cloud-piercing peaks loomed. Second to Wolf asked, “What is this Cloud Azure place?”

The uncle-in-law exclaimed, “You don’t know? The Cloud Pure Sect—foremost orthodox faction—resides there! Their adepts often soar above our village. True immortals!”

Guan Yu mused, “Orthodox sects imply demonic ones exist. Uncle, what of them?”

“Demonic cults are vile, murderous fiends! All deserve death!”

Guan Yu sighed—such indoctrination reeked of sect propaganda.

Tian declared, “Our elders have monitored this tree for ties to demonkind. Its removal would sever clues to their realm’s location.”

“Hypocrites!” Guan Yu spat. “If your sect covets it, transplant the accursed thing! Let it poison your own peaks instead of siphoning our land’s vitality while your kind idly watches!”

The chief, silently approving, let Guan Yu confront Tian.

“The tree is a demonic entity,” Tian insisted. “Uprooting risks killing it, destroying evidence.”

“A millennium of observation yielded nothing?” the chief challenged.

Tian hesitated. “Long ago, a demon beast infiltrated here, devouring an infant before vanishing. This tree emerged afterward—a likely demonic plant. We preserve it to trace their domain.”

“How noble,” Guan Yu sneered. “Sacrificing villagers to protect your pet project? You left them to rot—generations plagued by its toxins—just to chase legends!”

“Our elders aided during plagues—”

“Only to maintain your specimen’s guardians!” Guan Yu shouted for all to hear. “Why not relocate these people? You treat them as hounds guarding your trap!”

Tian stiffened. “Without your interference, they’d have lived peacefully—”

“Peace?” Guan Yu pointed at the chief’s monstrous son’s corpse. “Today, this abomination would’ve slaughtered everyone! Where were your vaunted immortals then? Don’t claim ignorance—your high-perched sect surely spied through arcane means!”

“Enough! To destroy the tree, you must defeat me,” Tian declared.

Second to Wolf brandished his blade. “A minor cultivator playing god? Let’s test your mettle!”

Wind gathered around Tian as a protective barrier formed. Second to Wolf’s crescent-shaped energy slash tore through the first defense, forcing Tian to erect another shield.

Closing in, Second to Wolf pressed the attack. As Tian fumbled for a talisman, the duel escalated—cultivator against warrior, doctrine against defiance beneath the poisoned tree’s shadow.

**Chapter 3096: The Orthodox Sect**

Guan Yu and Second to Wolf exchanged puzzled glances. The uncle-in-law elaborated, “The Cloud Pure Sect leads all righteous factions. Their disciples wield magic artifacts, flying sword-skies like legends!”

“Orthodox versus demonic…” Guan Yu muttered. “Typical dichotomy.”

**Chapter 3097: Pursuit**

Tian barely parried the onslaught. Second to Wolf’s relentless strikes forced the cultivator back, each clash echoing the conflict between mortal resolve and immortal arrogance.
