Amy and Guan Yu exchanged a glance, having reached mutual understanding. Though Guan Yu hadn't stayed long with the elf clan, deep friendships had blossomed with many members. This departure's duration remained uncertain, and Amy's emotional ties to the elf tribe dwarfed his own by magnitudes. Guan Yu mused that were it not for her attachment to him, no persuasion could have convinced Amy to leave the Elven Forest with outsiders!

"Lord Guan Yu, Princess Amy, can't you stay longer? We're all reluctant to part with you both!"

"Indeed, Princess Amy! Do you remember who carried you daily during your childhood? It was me!"

"Lord Guan Yu, when you return to the Dragon Clan, you must truthfully explain our elf clan's situation to your Patriarch. Our two great races mustn't harbor conflicts!"

......

Amidst the chorus of farewells, Guan Yu felt profound warmth. Nodding while tactfully declining, he responded, "Dear friends, I've noted all your words. Within my capabilities, nothing shall be neglected. Yet we truly cannot delay further. Certain confidential matters prevent full disclosure now, but upon our return, all shall be revealed!"

"Lord Guan Yu, feel no discomfort. Those undertaking great endeavors bear heavy responsibilities and constant peril. We shan't impede you. Depart with peace - we await your triumphant return!"

"Your understanding moves me deeply. With enlightened clansmen like yourselves, I'm certain the elf clan shall soon become a formidable force in Blue Beauty Continent!"

As enthusiasm mounted, two distant figures materialized on the horizon, their presence illuminating the scene.

"They came after all..."

Seeing the approaching forms, ripples of emotion stirred Guan Yu's heart. Though countless words remained unspoken, time permitted no delay. Amy tugged his sleeve, whispering, "Dragon Clan Brother, bid farewell to those two sisters. They truly cherish you."

Guan Yu smiled understandingly. "Indeed, little imp grows ever more perceptive."

Chapter 1372: The Enigmatic Town

Approaching Roxie and Shao Siming through the crowd, Guan Yu found both women squinting at him. In unison they declared: "Congratulations, Lord Guan Yu! You've finally achieved your wish to depart!"

"Ahem, what nonsense! If others misunderstand my intentions, surely you two know better?"

"How could mere women comprehend Lord Guan Yu's grand designs?"

This retort left Guan Yu speechless. Even now, their resentment over his choice surprised him. "Ah, women's hearts remain eternally inscrutable," he sighed inwardly.

Suddenly both women's eyes crinkled with suppressed laughter. "Enough teasing! See how troubled you become? We've but one request - safeguard yourself and protect Sister Amy!"

"This I swear! Fear not, dear wives!"

Nami immediately glared, unfamiliar with "husband" but understanding "wife" perfectly. "Who's your wife? Dream on! Expecting multiple women to serve while you gallivant freely? Moreover, should you court others abroad..." She brandished a fist. "...retribution awaits!"

Guan Yu sighed at their preemptive warning. Future romantic pursuits would require careful consideration.

After final exchanges, noon approached. Having bid farewell to the elves, Amy rejoined Guan Yu.

"Return now! Elder, your entrusted task shall be fulfilled impeccably!"

With this declaration, Guan Yu and Amy embarked for Jinzhou City.

Chapter 1373: The Bloodsucking Demon

Nestled in Amy's arms slept Bika Cat. Despite Patriarch Allen's advice against pursuing Locke directly, Guan Yu deemed locating the Blackwater Mercenary leader through his associate Wei Buqun the swiftest solution. However, Wei's death and Locke's disappearance suggested the latter might have fled to Blackwater Mercenary Corps.

After six hours' travel, they reached a peripheral Jinzhou town - economically stagnant and socially chaotic despite its metropolitan affiliation.

Exploring the desolate streets, Guan Yu noted eerie silence punctuated by sporadic weeping. Rare passersby scurried head-down, avoiding contact. As dusk fell, weary and hungry, they located an inn.

The fifty-something innkeeper scrutinized them warily before inquiring, "Lodging or meals?"

"Both. Pray tell, why does this town feel so... peculiar?"

"Peculiar? No idea!" The keeper's evasive eyes betrayed fear.

"Truly ignorant? Or concealing something?"

"Enough! Stay or leave!"

Switching tactics, Guan Yu flashed gold coins. The keeper's pupils dilated with greed. "Describe the town's situation truthfully, and this hundred gold coins becomes yours. More for exceptional cooperation."

After agonizing hesitation, avarice triumphed. "For this gold... I'll risk my neck!"

"Excellent. Now explain your earlier terror."

Bolting doors and windows, the keeper whispered: "Yesterday noon... a monster came. Human-like yet not - green animal-scale armor covered its body!"

"Monster's deeds?"

The keeper trembled. "It slaughtered every living thing! Merciless! Even now..."

Guan Yu pondered - neither beast nor conventional demon. Suddenly recalling Locke's demonized form, he shuddered. Could this be their target?

Interrupted by Amy's tug, he refocused as Bika Cat interjected: "The creature killed six people and a bull at market yesterday! Worse... it drank their blood!"

"Blood-drinking?" Guan Yu's mind flooded with vampiric imagery. "Then?"

Before the answer, the keeper fainted at seeing the talking cat.

Chapter 1374: Feline Rodent Phobia?

Awaiting the keeper's revival, they dined while night deepened. Amy drowsily retired as Guan Yu maintained vigil.

Hours later, the awakened keeper gaped terrified at Bika Cat.

"Good sir, understand we mean no harm..." Guan Yu began soothingly.
