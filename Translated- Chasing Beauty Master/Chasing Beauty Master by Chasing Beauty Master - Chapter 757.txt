With a whoosh, Guan Yu's metal rod smashed onto the opponent's skull. The man immediately clutched his head and rolled on the ground, writhing in silent agony.

The scarlet blood oozing from between Guan Yu's fingernails revealed the man's cracked skull.

The remaining attackers froze. Guan Yu's brutality had cowed them all—not a soul dared advance now, instead retreating step by step. This was precisely the outcome Guan Yu desired.

Several who retreated too slowly received vicious blows from the iron rod. Their howls of pain echoed as they fled, convinced their bones were shattered, any bravado utterly extinguished.

**Chapter 1920: Never Again**

Guan Yu didn't pursue the escapees. Though some had fled, dozens still remained—some standing, others collapsed—leaving sixty or seventy in total.

Strolling to where Chen Maosheng lay, Guan Yu gazed down imperiously. Recent hardships had embittered Chen, his legs now useless, his body crippled. “Fuck your mother!” Chen spat, voice trembling with rage. “Worthless dogs! I feed you for nothing! Attack him! Now!”

“You want them to attack?” Guan Yu snarled, already moving.

Regret and terror flooded Chen Maosheng. He’d underestimated this Tae Kwon Do champion, foolishly believing mere minions could subdue him. Clutching his thighs to numb the pain, his mind went blank as Guan Yu’s rod crashed onto his skull.

The blow nearly knocked Chen unconscious. Slumping onto the grass, he gasped as another strike hammered his body. “You wanted Lü Mei?” *Thud.* “Wanted me dead?” *Thud.* “What now?” *Thud.*

The brutality horrified onlookers. Female students shrieked at the periphery.

Each blow fractured Chen’s vertebrae. Drenched in blood, he whimpered, “Spare me, sir... please... no more...”

Guan Yu’s mercilessness chilled every witness. This was a man who killed without blinking.

Even Lü Mei covered her eyes, trembling.

The remaining gang members wavered. With their leader broken, why stay? Better flee before Guan Yu memorized their faces—staying meant exile from Kaihuang Academy.

As minds raced, stealthy exits began.

**Chapter 1921: Shattered Legs**

“Now you beg?” Guan Yu raised the rod high. Behind him, Lü Mei cried, “Stop! He’s learned his lesson!”

Relenting, Guan Yu growled, “I fear he’ll forget...”

“Never!” Chen choked. “I’ll remember your mercy!”

Turning, Guan Yu glared at the cowering crowd. “Hear this! The Qunhao Society is dissolved. Cross me again—” He hurled the rod at Chen’s limp form. “—and share his fate!”

Wei Hongwei and Jia Bo arrived, having rushed from class upon hearing of the ambush. Seeing Guan Yu unscathed and Chen mangled, Wei nodded. “Chen Maosheng, even double your numbers couldn’t beat him. Accept your defeat.”

An ambulance was called—Chen would bleed out otherwise.

Apologizing for their tardiness, the duo was waved off. “Not your fault,” Guan Yu said, surveying the carnage. Chen had indeed staked everything.

Whispers rippled through the crowd:

“Incredible...”

“A hundred men couldn’t take him!”

“So ruthless... yet so dashing!”

Amid the gawkers, Wang Jun watched thoughtfully. *No wonder women adore him. Protecting Lü Mei like that... any lover would feel cherished.*

Wei barked at the stunned gang members: “Scram, you morons!” The mob dispersed—Qunhao Society’s dissolution marked the rise of the Xiongyi Brotherhood.

This outcome pleased Guan Yu. Gangs should unite strength for justice, not tyranny. Rumor said Wang Hu now led Xiongyi—a capable man worth recruiting.

Wang Hu’s potential had shone during competitions. Pre-amnesia Guan Yu would’ve nurtured such talent, but now...

As the crowd thinned, Guan Yu glanced at Chen’s broken form. Hospital would claim him for months.

Only Lü Mei’s intervention had stayed Guan Yu’s killing hand. Death would’ve brought needless complications.

**Chapter 1922: Ruthless Strikes**

News rocketed through Kaihuang Academy, reaching the principal’s ears. “Guan Yu’s no ordinary fish,” he muttered, smoking by the window. “Why provoke him? Chen’s father will pester me again.”

Wei reported: “Centipede leaked your movements to Chen.”

“Centipede?” Guan Yu’s voice hardened.

“A Qunhao elder in Class 4,” Wei explained.

“Trash,” Guan Yu spat. “Let’s visit him.”

Escorting Lü Mei back, Guan Yu drew stares and flinches—his infamy now palpable.

“Do I frighten people?” he asked Wei.

“A bit,” Wei grinned.

“Bastard,” Guan Yu chuckled.

Spectators trailed them, buzzing: “He’ll rule Kaihuang!”

In Class 4, Centipede groped a moaning girl when the door crashed open. The girl yelped, nearly castrating him as she fled.

“Who dares—?!” Centipede froze seeing Guan Yu. “You... should be hospitalized!”

“Chen’s finished,” Wei said. “Your turn.”

Centipede grabbed a machete. “Come closer, I’ll break your legs!”

Guan Yu laughed, disarming him with ease. The blade slapped Centipede’s face repeatedly before a kick sent him skidding.

“Still bold?” Guan Yu loomed.

“Kill me or I’ll haunt you!” Centipede spat blood.

“You wanted my legs?” Guan Yu raised the machete. The girl’s scream pierced walls as steel flashed down.
