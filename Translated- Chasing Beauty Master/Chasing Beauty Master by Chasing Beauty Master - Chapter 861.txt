“If you like it, hurry up and turn it on to try it out.” Guan Yu said cheerfully, clearly fond of Qu Shuangshuang. He thought to himself that knowing how endearing she was, he should have bought her an Apple laptop too - after all, students need computers.

“I love it! Thank you, handsome brother!” Qu Shuangshuang jumped up excitedly. She'd seen this phone before - a classmate owned one. Though most phone users at school were teachers, she knew this model was expensive.

When Shuangshuang jumped up, her aunt noticed the Apple logo on the phone's back, recalling it matched Ling'er's laptop that cost "several cows worth." Realizing this phone's value, she hurriedly said: “Shuangshuang, stop this! Return it immediately. We can't accept such expensive gifts.”

Shuangshuang instantly deflated. Her coveted prize was being snatched away just as she got it. Pouting stubbornly, she pleaded: “Mom, but I really like this phone!”

“Absolutely not. Give it back now.” The aunt insisted firmly.

Guan Yu found this baffling. Everything he brought was legitimately purchased, not stolen. In the city, you had to give gifts or money to get things done, yet here his generosity was rejected. He'd wanted to build goodwill through these presents, but this family's reaction confused him.

Chapter 2237: One More Makes No Difference

“Once during heavy rain, she stood in the downpour for over two hours. I thought she'd left, but when I went out, she'd collapsed in the rain. After carrying her to hospital, our ambiguous relationship began.”

“What? Another one? We haven't even gotten to Ling'er's boss lady yet! How many are there?” Shuangshuang exclaimed, eyes wide.

Guan Yu smiled wryly. Lan Yu wasn't truly his girlfriend - their relationship held gratitude more than romance. When her family business nearly collapsed, Guan Yu's assistance saved them. “Her father was a tycoon who failed in business. After my help, their family recovered. Lan Yu stays with me mainly from gratitude.”

He emphasized this to imply their relationship wasn't physical.

“Oh, don't explain! One more Lan Yu makes no difference to you, right? You're just keeping her around.” Shuangshuang saw through him instantly.

Truthfully, Guan Yu couldn't bear to abandon Lan Yu. Like choosing between fingers, each held sentimental value.

“Later, I met a pop star named Ah Mei.” Guan Yu said casually.

Shuangshuang lit up: “Ah Mei? My idol! Two years ago she was mega-famous! I love her songs! You know her?!”

Guan Yu had nearly forgotten Ah Mei's stardom. “Know her? She's my woman.”

“After a concert, Ah Mei vanished. Rumors said rivals killed her out of jealousy. People believed it since she disappeared completely.”

Guan Yu chuckled: “Rumors lie. Ah Mei's alive and well - living in my home.”

“What?! Don't tell me you're also...” Shuangshuang gasped, incredulous. “How many women are you juggling?!”

“Yes, Ah Mei's my girlfriend too. She enjoys the peaceful life away from fame.”

“Tell me your story! I must hear!” Shuangshuang begged.

“Well...I don't remember meeting her initially due to amnesia. She said I saved her life long ago. She became famous hoping I'd see her search. Even when she found me, I didn't recognize her.”

Shuangshuang's eyes moistened. “Ah Mei-jie is so devoted! I ache for her struggles...”

Guan Yu nodded. The entertainment industry was brutal - most female stars rose through wealth or compromising deals. Ah Mei's talent-driven success amidst such pressures amazed him.

“How did you reunite?” Shuangshuang pressed.

“She spotted me at her A-city concert. My friend dragged me there. When she saw me in the crowd, she nearly lost composure. Later, she quit stardom to live with me.”

“Memories don't matter! Reunion is everything! Ah Mei-jie finally got her happy ending!” Shuangshuang clasped her hands prayerfully.

Surprisingly, instead of jealousy, Shuangshuang radiated fangirl joy. “Handsome brother, please let me meet Ah Mei-jie!”

“Of course! Anytime.” Guan Yu patted her head.

“Yay! I'll tell sis - she's a fan too!” Shuangshuang bounced. “Now tell me about Yang Conghan! The top heiress must be stunning!”

Chapter 2238: Pride

“I met Yang Conghan at Flower Night Club where Ling'er works. She deliberately lured me there. Her father, the Yang patriarch, became vegetative after Qi deviation during cultivation. They'd heard I possessed the Jiezun Sacred Relic.”

“This relic can resurrect the dead. Yang Conghan offered herself if I used it to save her father.”

“Wow! Miss Yang must be gorgeous to warrant such a priceless trade!” Shuangshuang marveled. “What's this relic?”

Guan Yu hesitated. “Something I obtained pre-amnesia...from slaying a demonic cultivator in an Arctic ice cave. It manifested from his corpse.”

“Demonic cultivators? Are we in a sci-fi movie?” Shuangshuang giggled.

Guan Yu sighed - ordinary folks couldn't comprehend cultivators' world. “Truthfully, my memories are unclear.”

Opting to omit Jin Hua and Zhang Han's complicated stories, Guan Yu changed tack.

“With so many women at home, don't they fight over you?” Shuangshuang probed.

Though recent additions might disrupt harmony, Guan Yu boasted: “They get along wonderfully. No conflicts.”

Shuangshuang pouted skeptically: “I don't buy it! Multiple women sharing one man? Only puppies would believe that!”

Secretly, she wondered how she'd fit in if joining this harem.

“Come see for yourself when we visit Ah Mei.” Guan Yu stood. “Time for bed.”

Returning inside, Ling'er shot Guan Yu a peculiar glance he couldn't decipher. Unbeknownst to him, the family had been discussing why Ling'er hadn't become his woman yet.

Meimei teased: “Brother Guan, you've quite the entourage at home!”

“How'd you know?” Shuangshuang blurted, having just learned this herself.

“Ling'er told us!” Meimei laughed.

Guan Yu shot Ling'er an exasperated look as the aunt bluntly asked: “You two are so close. Why not take it further?”

Ling'er blushed, tugging her mother's sleeve.

“Ling'er seeks stability I can't provide.” Guan Yu answered diplomatically. “She deserves someone safer, less wealthy and dangerous.”

His words mirrored Ling'er's unspoken thoughts about his risky lifestyle and media-worthy conflicts.

Chapter 2239: Approval

The room fell silent, then erupted in laughter. Ling'er's parents exchanged approving looks - they viewed Guan Yu as a son already.

“Enough talk!” Ling'er protested, cheeks flaming.

Guan Yu concluded: “We want each other's happiness, whatever form that takes.”

Shuangshuang gazed at him starry-eyed, mentally claiming him as her ideal man.

As the night deepened, the family's warmth enveloped them all - acceptance and unspoken understandings weaving through their bonds.
