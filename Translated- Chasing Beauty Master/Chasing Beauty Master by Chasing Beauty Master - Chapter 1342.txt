When Guan Yu obediently took his seat, Wang Xiaorong’s mood settled. She said, “Sister Liu, I truly understand your predicament. If you continue living in hiding year after year, improving your circumstances will be exceedingly difficult. Yet if you choose to collaborate with the Demonic Soul Sect, everything you desire could be granted. This is the goal you strive for—why not pursue what is reasonable?”

“Young Mistress Rong, I’ll speak plainly. You cannot comprehend the suffocating weight of living under another’s roof. Our current freedom, however precarious, is far preferable to that oppression.” Xi Liu remained resolute against aligning with the Demonic Soul Sect. She continued, “Since news of the Eight-Sided Drum cultivation method spread, the entire martial world has been thrown into chaos. While we deeply desire it, we will not resort to force. If fate denies us this opportunity, we shall accept it.”

“Your chances are indeed slim,” Wang Xiaorong said bluntly. “The righteous factions are circling like tigers. With the meager strength of your Monster Demon Cave, you cannot hope to compete. Moreover, if you refuse to join the Demonic Soul Sect, my father will surely hunt you down.”

“I am well aware. Thus, I implore you, Young Mistress Rong, not to reveal our whereabouts to the Demon Lord. At least this way, we may remain hidden a little longer.” Xi Liu approached to refill Guan Yu’s tea. “We both know the Monster Demon Cave holds no real value to the Demon Lord. At best, we would be conscripted as cannon fodder. I am weary—weary of bloodshed, of endless hiding. My sisters deserve normal lives. We will not join the Demonic Soul Sect, nor shall we cling to our identity as part of the Demonic Sect’s Monster Demon Cave.”

It seemed Xi Liu and her sister Xi Taohua sought redemption—a quiet life far from the jianghu. Such a path required only retreat to a place unknown to their enemies.

Guan Yu interjected, “Xiaorong, I hope you’ll conceal Sister Liu’s whereabouts from the Demon Lord. You’ll help them, won’t you?”

“The issue isn’t me, but their inability to remain hidden. Even if I stay silent, the Demonic Soul Sect will soon discover them here. How can paper ever hope to contain fire?”

“Nonsense! If neither of us speaks, who else would know? They’ve managed well under the cover of the Echo Pavilion. That shield should suffice.”

“You usually seem clever—why act like a fool now?” Wang Xiaorong snapped, jabbing a finger at him. “I’ve visited twice and already noticed irregularities. Do you think the sect’s spies are as dim-witted as you? The only escape is to relocate.”

“Young Mistress Rong is right,” Xi Liu sighed. “Your noble status guarantees others will soon learn of us. Recent slips are our own fault.”

“Rest assured, Sister Liu. I swear to keep your secret. But how long you evade notice… that depends on fortune.” Wang Xiaorong added, “Since you refuse allegiance, I won’t press further. But know this: the Demonic Soul Sect and the Blood Hunt Sect are locked in conflict. Should you spurn us, do not side with them either.”

“Naturally. We bow to neither force—be it your sect or the Blood Hunt. You have my word.”

“Very well. If you’re so opposed to alliance, so be it.” Wang Xiaorong’s persuasion had drained her, yet she would not compel them.

Guan Yu stood. “Are your discussions concluded? May I leave now? My friends will worry if I delay further.”

Xi Liu inquired, “Young Mistress Rong, I’m curious—aren’t you afraid, traveling alone among Cloud Azure Sect disciples? Surely the Demon Lord disapproves.”

Wang Xiaorong nodded. “Father forbids me from approaching Guan Yu. But I adore him! I sneaked out to be near him.”

“Guan Yu is a rare prodigy—the first dual cultivator of demonic and martial arts in countless years. His potential is limitless.” Xi Liu mused inwardly: With such a talent in Cloud Azure Sect, the demonic factions’ future grew bleak.

“He’s just a brash boy—don’t flatter him into arrogance,” Wang Xiaorong chided, as if scolding a child.

As Guan Yu moved to depart, Xi Liu urged, “Stay for supper. Regardless of your identity, our meeting is fate. I’ve already ordered preparations.”

“Exactly! Are my company so unpleasant?” Wang Xiaorong clung to his arm. “I won’t let you go!”

**Chapter 3468: A Good Girl**

Resigned, Guan Yu accepted the inevitable meal. If Wang Xiaorong followed him to his uncle’s home, chaos would ensue. Perhaps this dinner would deter her.

Servants soon presented an array of exquisite dishes. The aromas tempted Guan Yu’s appetite—such delicacies shouldn’t be wasted.

Meanwhile, Xiao Bao escorted the heavily intoxicated Qin Taijin home via carriage. The journey’s jostling induced violent retching. By arrival, Qin could barely stand, having purged the day’s indulgences.

“Young Master has returned!” A servant shouted at the Qin estate gates. “Inform Madam!”

The household bustled into action. A matronly woman adorned in silks and jewels hurried out—clearly Qin’s mother. “Jin’er! Why so late? And so drunk!”

Xiao Bao explained politely, “He celebrated with friends at my establishment. My apologies for the hour.”

Madam Qin appraised the courteous girl. “You’ve been most kind. Please, rest inside.”

Xiao Bao demurred but seized the chance to enter the lavish estate, memorizing its opulent layout. When Qin Taijin recoiled from an elderly maid—cursing and flailing—Xiao Bao soothed him, leveraging his trust to remain close.

“Perhaps I should assist him inside,” she suggested, earning Madam Qin’s gratitude.

As Xiao Bao departed, two men—Xiao Zhi and A’Ze—noticed her Echo Pavilion attire but prioritized attending Qin. They carried the incoherent youth to his chambers.

Back at Echo Pavilion, Guan Yu struggled to disentangle himself. Wang Xiaorong’s persistence forced Xi Liu to intervene: “Young Mistress, consider the danger. Cloud Azure disciples would kill you on sight. Stay here—I guarantee your safety.”

“I’m not afraid! None of those weaklings could touch me!”

“Should I sell you to a brothel?” Guan Yu threatened.

“You wouldn’t dare!” She glared. “I’d castrate you first! Besides…you’d never do that.”

Xi Liu reasoned, “Think of Guan Yu’s position. Forcing him to protect you against his sect would brand him a traitor. Is that the legacy you want for him?”

Wang Xiaorong relented. “Fine. I’ll stay tonight.”

**Chapter 3469: A Dilemma**

At dawn, Guan Yu rose, relieved to have evaded Wang Xiaorong’s pursuit. Testing his qi, he found it responsive—no trace of the erratic behavior during yesterday’s skirmish. Perhaps his inner energy only faltered in true mortal peril…as if it feared death itself.

Seeking solitude, he headed to the garden’s stone platform for meditation. The crisp air and tranquil scenery promised fruitful cultivation.
