“And I can sense the power behind Guan Yu’s punch – not the slightest bit diminished despite his injuries.”

...

“Of course, Xiao Dao merely felt surprised, nothing more.”

...

Their first exchange ended in a draw, with neither gaining the upper hand.

“Not bad,” Xiao Dao rasped in a grating, unpleasant voice.

“Tch! The real surprises are yet to come!” Guan Yu sneered, charging at Xiao Dao again.

His ability to withstand Xiao Dao’s strikes stemmed from the time he’d bought through stalling Jiang Ziqi earlier, allowing his healing powers to restore most of his strength.

This was the terrifying advantage of his instant regeneration. As long as Guan Yu had sufficient energy reserves, he could become an indefatigable fighting machine – an opponent no one could hope to match.

Xiao Dao’s interest grew. Facing such an intriguing adversary, he began taking the battle seriously.

...

Guan Yu’s powerful roundhouse kick swept toward Xiao Dao’s flank, only to be blocked effortlessly by the latter’s right arm.

Undeterred, Guan Yu twisted at the waist with impossible flexibility, delivering a crushing blow aimed at Xiao Dao’s neck.

Xiao Dao shifted his stance subtly, catching Guan Yu’s fist while simultaneously kneeing him viciously in the abdomen.

Guan Yu went flying, crashing into chairs that splintered beneath him.

The gap between them became painfully clear – this wasn’t a battle between equals. Guan Yu had only felt such disparity when facing Lin Dong, who routinely pummeled him into submission.

Yet where gaps existed, Guan Yu bridged them through his unique healing system.

...

Their brutal exchange continued – Guan Yu’s wild haymaker met Xiao Dao’s precise counter, each trading damaging blows. Though seemingly even, Guan Yu sustained far worse injuries.

“Bastard!” Xiao Dao roared, finally provoked by Guan Yu’s reckless tactics. His whip-fast kick caught Guan Yu’s chest, drawing blood.

Seizing the opening, Guan Yu lunged past Xiao Dao toward Jiang Ziqi.

“I said you’d regret this!” Guan Yu grinned savagely, grabbing Jiang Ziqi’s collar and kneeing him viciously.

Xiao Dao’s furious counterpunch sent Guan Yu sprawling, but not before Jiang Ziqi’s face became a swollen mess.

“Tch! I’d say I came out ahead!” Guan Yu spat blood, grinning madly. “Jiang Ziqi – a narrow-minded turtle like you deserves nothing but a beating!”

...

As Xiao Dao advanced menacingly, Guan Yu suddenly bolted for the door. “Lin Dong! Get your ass out here or I quit being your punching bag!”

...

Chapter 880: Fists and Fury, Guan Yu Profits

...

The battle turned brutally comical as Guan Yu exploited Xiao Dao’s distraction to pummel Jiang Ziqi. “I warned you we’d see who beats whom!”

...

Xu Yuan watched bitterly as Guan宇 leveraged his connections. “You could try threatening me,” Guan宇 mocked, “but we both know who holds the cards here.”

...

Jiang Ziqi glared hatefully. “No one can save you now, Guan宇!”

...

“Jiang the Turtle,” Guan宇 sneered, “still sulking after getting your shell kicked?”

The confrontation escalated until Lin Dong’s abrupt appearance shifted the balance. “Touching my punching bag comes at a price,” Lin Dong warned before overwhelming Xiao Dao with blistering speed.

...

Chapter 881: Failed Ambitions

...

As Lin Dong dominated Xiao Dao, Guan宇 turned his attention to Xu Yuan. “Choose: watch these twins entertain you, or crawl out to wash your face?”

...

The situation crystallized – despite being on home turf, Xu Yuan recognized the futility of confrontation. Meanwhile, Jiang Ziqi’s threats rang hollow against Guan宇’s growing web of alliances.

“Believe me,” Xu Yuan threatened weakly, “no one guarantees your safe exit.”

Guan宇 merely shrugged. “Save your breath, Jiang the Turtle. Your hollow posturing changes nothing.”
