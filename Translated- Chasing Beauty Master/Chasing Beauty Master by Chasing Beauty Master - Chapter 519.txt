The fat man pointed toward Guan Yu and the skinny man, only to find Guan Yu's hand clamped around the latter's throat, poised to end his life at any moment.

"Ah...save...me...I can't...breathe...please...spare me..." The black-clad man struggled as he pleaded, yet Guan Yu remained unmoved. Having roamed the martial world for years, he knew its ruthlessness all too well. Had their positions been reversed, this wretch would have slain him without hesitation.

"You want me to release you? Heh, no problem—but not yet. You still have...uses. Do endure some discomfort for now."

Guan Yu tightened his grip, the skinny man's windpipe creaking under pressure, as he strode toward the other black-clad figures.

The remaining henchmen had just debated intervening when, to their shock, their leader fell so easily to Guan Yu. "Brat! We underestimated you," one spat. "Our elder brother ranks as a Great Sword Master—a renowned expert across the continent! Yet you pressed him relentlessly..."

"Flattery ill becomes you," Guan Yu chuckled. "Truthfully, I'm not so formidable. It's simply..."

"Simply what?!"

"Ha! Don't take offense—you lot are just...trash."

The insult ignited the fat man's fury. His blade hissed halfway from its scabbard before a mustachioed comrade stayed his hand. "Why stop me?! I'll teach this whelp—"

His rant died as Guan Yu increased pressure. The skeletal man now gasped like a beached fish, eyes rolling back. "G-g-gentlemen...cease..." he croaked.

Guan Yu maintained his vise-like hold.

"Elder Brother!" the others cried helplessly. Had glares could kill, Guan Yu would've perished ten thousandfold.

"Release him, cur! Let us parley!"

"Amusing!" Guan Yu laughed. "You insult me while begging negotiation? How transparent!"

The mustachioed man forced a conciliatory smile. "We...never learned your esteemed name."

"My name?" Guan Yu pondered mockingly. "You may address me as...Grandfather."

"You court death!" Enraged, the group lunged. Guan Yu sensed invisible forces converging from all directions.

Seeing this, he knew the skinny man's usefulness had expired. A sharp twist snapped the frail neck like dry kindling. He tossed the corpse toward the others. "Vile brigand!" they howled. "First our sixth brother, now our leader! We'll carve you to ribbons!"

As the black-clad men advanced, Guan Yu noted their diminutive leader's eerie calm. The squat, rat-faced man observed impassively, as if this slaughter concerned him not.

"A chief unmoved by subordinates' deaths? Most novel!" Guan Yu taunted, though unease prickled his spine. Such indifference hinted at unparalleled ruthlessness—if the Blackwater Mercenary Corps leader valued his own men no more than weeds, what mercy could foes expect? Moreover, his silence suggested these attackers were mere whetstones to test Guan Yu's skill. So long as the leader refrained, he still controlled the board.

A scream shattered Guan Yu's analysis. "No!" Amy's voice rang out. He turned to see her unleash a magical burst, vaporizing a mercenary grasping at her. Nearby, Shi Tuo's gaping maw loomed. Before Guan Yu could react, the lion-man's thunderous roar sent a dozen assailants flying.

"Lion’s Roar Technique?!" Guan Yu gaped. "So childhood tales hold truth!"

"Behold my might, young Guan!" Shi Tuo boomed. "While their chief dawdles, dispatch those remaining Great Sword Masters! Why that look? You handled the last easily!"

Guan Yu nearly cursed aloud. The cunning old beast chose to mop up minions with his sonic arts, leaving four elite adversaries to him! Though he'd bested the skinny man through surprise and recklessness, facing four cautious masters promised different stakes—especially with their enigmatic leader looming.

"Fool! Move!" Shi Tuo's shout jolted him. Guan Yu barely leapt aside as blades scored the earth where he'd stood. The four swordsmen enclosed him—the fat man glowering foremost.

"Nowhere left to flee, whelp. We'll mince your flesh to appease our brothers' spirits!"

"Cough...fatso, all bark no bite. Dare face me alone?"

"Tricks won't work twice!" the obese swordsman sneered. "You hid your strength, luring my brother to complacency. Now witness true—"

His tirade ended as Guan Yu blurred behind him. Violet light flashed—an enhanced Qi Blade, modified with arcane knowledge to pierce both flesh and soul. The fat man crumpled, eyes wide with shock and hatred.

Three remained. The mustachioed "Third Brother" rallied them: "Stay calm! Together we—"

"Cease prattling!" Guan Yu interrupted. "Come at once! I've no time for play."

Enraged yet wary, the trio attacked with venomous precision. Guan Yu danced through their onslaught, but fatigue gnawed at him—two consecutive duels now a third.

"End this swiftly!" He disengaged, materializing behind Third Brother with a blade of pure darkness—an experimental fusion of martial qi and shadow magic.

"Die, and all ends!" The ebon edge flew true.

"Behind you!" comrades warned. Third Brother parried, but dark mothes erupted across his palm. "Wh-what sorcery?!"

The spots spread painlessly until his entire body blackened. Then agony struck—a thousand scorpion stings beneath the skin. "AAAAH!" His flesh withered like rotten fruit, dissolving to nothingness.

"Demon!" survivors shrieked. "What hellish craft—"

"Silence!" The shrill command froze all. The diminutive leader finally approached, beady eyes locked on Guan Yu. "To wield shadow magic so young...a death sentence."

"Save your hypocrisy!" Guan Yu shot back. "How many have your Blackwater filth slaughtered? I but cleanse the world!"

The chief's lips peeled in a jackal's grin. "You mistake felling pups for matching wolves. I observed every move. If that's your limit..."

"Need I remind you?" Guan Yu nodded toward Shi Tuo and Amy, now approaching. "My allies stand ready."

"Allies?" The chief chuckled mirthlessly. "Let us see what valor corpse-worms muster."
