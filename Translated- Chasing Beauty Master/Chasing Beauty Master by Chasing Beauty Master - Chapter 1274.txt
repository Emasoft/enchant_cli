“If more people discover we’ve been roasting meat in the woods and the Sect Master finds out, carefree days like these will be over.”

“What should we do? We can’t just stand here waiting forever. Look around—people are coming and going nonstop. If we wait for this place to empty out, we’ll be stuck here till nightfall,” Xiao Zhi muttered, pursing his lips.

**Chapter 3277: A Blessing or a Curse**

Guan Yu pondered for a moment before asking, “Didn’t you two enter the woods from Xuanshang Peak before? That area should be deserted now. Why don’t we go through there?”

“No,” Xiao Zhi and Liang Mang rejected in unison. “It’s too far. Xuanshang Peak isn’t exactly close, and we can’t use sword flight techniques on Tigerhead Peak. If we walk back out, fly to Xuanshang Peak, then enter the woods, it’ll take too long. A Ze doesn’t have that kind of time—he has an afternoon match.”

Guan Yu nodded. “You’re right. It’s too distant. Then it seems we’re left with one final option.”

“What option? Do you have another plan, Guan Yu?” A Ze asked eagerly.

“This plan… is more of a last resort,” Guan Yu said mysteriously. “I can ask Master to grant us permission to enter.”

“What?!” Xiao Zhi gaped. “You’re going to tell the Sect Master we want to sneak into the woods? That’s just asking for a scolding!”

Guan Yu smirked. “Trust me. Follow my lead. This is the safest way.”

Unsure what trick Guan Yu had up his sleeve, Xiao Zhi and A Ze trailed behind him curiously. To save time, Guan Yu quickened his pace, heading straight to his quarters.

Knowing Second to Wolf was napping inside, Guan Yu roused him. “Wake up, lazybones! How can you sleep this late?”

“Why’d you wake me? Something wrong?” Second to Wolf yawned, blinking groggily at Xiao Zhi and A Ze.

“Greetings, Brother Second! You were sleeping soundly,” the two said in unison.

“Oh, it’s you two. Heh. I stayed up all night, so I’m catching up on sleep. Come, sit! Standing tickets are hard to come by,” Second to Wolf joked.

Xiao Zhi and A Ze exchanged puzzled glances, unfamiliar with the concept of “buying tickets,” and chuckled awkwardly.

Second to Wolf squinted at Guan Yu. “Why’d you drag me out of bed?” His expression turned wary—experience taught him Guan Yu’s visits rarely boded well.

“Of course there’s a reason. I wouldn’t disturb your beauty sleep otherwise,” Guan Yu replied cheerfully. Second to Wolf narrowed his eyes. “What is it? Good news or bad?”

“Good news, naturally. I’ve got a treat for you.” Guan Yu grinned. “The three of us are inviting you to feast on something delicious.”

“A treat? What kind? This isn’t another scam, is it?” Second to Wolf eyed him skeptically.

Guan Yu straightened, feigning solemnity. “You know the woods out there? The ones filled with pheasants and such?”

“Obviously. I’m not deaf,” Second to Wolf grumbled. “Those woods are teeming with game. Bet a roasted pheasant would taste amazing.”

Xiao Zhi laughed. “Brother Second, that’s exactly why we’re here!”

Second to Wolf’s eyes lit up—he was a sucker for good food and drink. Guan Yu opened a small pouch, revealing spices. “Look. Everything we need for roasting. Well? Convinced?”

“Damn! Why didn’t you mention this sooner? Let’s go!” Second to Wolf leapt from bed, then paused. “Wait—those woods are forbidden to disciples. I knew you were lying!”

He flopped back down, but Guan Yu pressed, “Get up! If you won’t come, we’ll go without you. Would I lie when I’ve brought the spices?”

Second to Wolf sprang up again, grinning. “Fine, fine! Let’s hurry.”

Guan Yu rolled his eyes and strode out, leaving Xiao Zhi and A Ze amused by the eccentric super-warrior.

Outside, Guan Yu addressed Second to Wolf. “Since the woods are off-limits, here’s the plan—”

“What plan?” Second to Wolf eyed him suspiciously. “You want me to catch a pheasant for you? Forget it. I’m going back to sleep.”

As he turned to leave, Guan Yu called out, “No chores—just follow me. I promise freshly roasted pheasant, rabbit, maybe even boar.”

Second to Wolf’s resolve crumbled. “Alright, I’m in. Lead the way.”

**Chapter 3279: The Decision**

Guan Yu then instructed, “Xiao Zhi, A Ze—come with me to see Master.” The group proceeded to Tigerhead Peak’s main hall, where Sect Master Xuan Ming and Elder Lu were seated.

Upon their entry, Elder Lu frowned. “Guan Yu, Xiao Zhi—what brings you here?”

Guan Yu bowed respectfully. “Master, Elder Lu.”

Xiao Zhi and A Ze followed suit, while Second to Wolf stood defiantly, his blade slung over a shoulder.

Elder Lu, admiring Second to Wolf’s boldness, asked, “Brother Second, what business brings you?”

**Chapter 3280: Hurry and Help!**

Second to Wolf grew impatient, having spotted numerous rabbits and pheasants. “Guan Yu, you came here before—why didn’t you invite me? Some friend you are!”

Guan Yu sighed. “Last time, I came alone for a change from cafeteria food. You were at Qianhui Peak—how could I fetch you?”

“You could’ve taken me afterward!”

“There was never a chance. I’m bringing you now, aren’t I?”

Second to Wolf huffed. “You’re just using me as bait so Sect Master Xuan Ming lets you in. Clever.”

Guan Yu blinked, surprised by his sudden astuteness. “Regardless, we’re inside now.”

As they reached a babbling stream, Xiao Zhi pointed. “Here! What do you think, Brother Second?”

Second to Wolf surveyed the secluded clearing. “Good spot. Hidden by thickets, with a stream nearby. Practical.”

A Ze praised, “Brother Second speaks like a seasoned wanderer!”

Guan Yu smirked. “More like a seasoned sluggard.”

“Enough chatter—I’m starving!” Second to Wolf declared. “You two gather firewood. Guan Yu and I will hunt.”

Xiao Zhi protested, “Let us hunt. You rest—”

“With your speed? I’ll handle it. Just get the fire ready.” Second to Wolf vanished into the woods.

Soon, a crackling fire roared. A Ze joked, “My Yunqing Sword’s real talent is chopping wood!” as he split logs.

Guan Yu returned with two rabbits. “Luck was with me—found them in a burrow.”

A Ze skinned them deftly. “This sword’s better at prep than combat!”

As the rabbits sizzled, Guan Yu tensed. Rustling foliage revealed Second to Wolf staggering under a massive boar carcass. “Damn thing led me on a chase! Help!”

Guan Yu gaped at the hundred-pound beast. “No wonder you’re winded!”

Xiao Zhi and A Ze rushed over, awestruck. “Brother Second goes big or goes home!”

“Quit gawking—get this on the fire!” Second to Wolf panted, pride mingling with exhaustion.
