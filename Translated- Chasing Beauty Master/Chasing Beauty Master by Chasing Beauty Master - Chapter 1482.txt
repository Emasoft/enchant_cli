When Magistrate Pang heard Young Master Li say this, he also felt it reasonable. Young Master Jiang outranked him by several levels—there was no need for such a high-ranking figure to show courtesy in this wretched place.

Yet Magistrate Pang remained uneasy. “We must proceed with caution,” he said. “Think about it—if Young Master Jiang hadn’t received some intelligence, even a hundred years of leisure wouldn’t bring him to this backwater. Don’t you agree?”

“This forsaken place has indeed never seen such distinguished visitors,” Young Master Li remarked. “For years, no one of importance has come here.”

Magistrate Pang’s words had even stirred unease in Young Master Li. If Young Master Jiang truly came to investigate, disaster loomed. Not only would their operations halt, but all traces must be erased immediately.

After a moment’s thought, Young Master Li suggested, “Why don’t we sell the current batch of women and lay low for a while? What do you think, Magistrate?”

“Young Master Li, have you lost your mind chasing coins?” Magistrate Pang glared at him. “If Young Master Jiang exposes us, our heads will roll! Yet you still fixate on this deal? Do you truly value silver over your life?”

Young Master Li’s face hardened. “I care not for consequences! If we fall, we fall together. I *will* complete this transaction before withdrawing. Not even Young Master Jiang’s arrival—nor his father’s—will stop me. Otherwise, weeks of effort go to waste!”

Magistrate Pang’s temper flared. Pointing at Li, he snapped, “This isn’t your decision to make! When I say stop, we stop. Remember your place! You’d do well to watch your tongue before me!”

“What standing do *you* have?” Young Master Li roared. “A petty eighth-rank official putting on airs? Without my silver lining your pockets, would you live this luxuriously? Without the women I’ve provided, would you know such comfort? You ungrateful cur! Ready to sever ties? Fine! I’ll confess everything to Young Master Jiang—let’s see who trembles then!”

Li turned as if to storm out, though his bare feet betrayed the bluff—he hadn’t even worn shoes.

Chastened, Magistrate Pang forced a conciliatory smile. “Young Master Li, let’s not be hasty—”

**Chapter 3863: Absolutely Not**

Young Master Li halted, anticipating this. “Magistrate Pang, I’ve no wish for discord either. Our partnership has prospered. Must we let Young Master Jiang block our path to wealth?”

“You’re right,” Pang conceded. “This... enterprise thrives in shadows. I’m not suggesting permanent cessation—only pausing during Jiang’s visit. The risk is too great. Once he departs, we resume. Isn’t that wiser?”

Li clutched his hips, cursing. “Damn that Jiang! Arriving at the worst moment! These women are prime stock—precisely conditioned. The major buyer expects them docile within the month. No resistance, absolute obedience. We’re on the fourth day of starvation—the critical juncture to break their will. Cease now, and four days’ effort vanishes!”

He continued urgently, “If we pause to feed them, we lose leverage. Prolonged starvation risks deaths, which I won’t allow. But stopping wastes progress. If they remain unruly by month’s end, I’ll face colossal losses!”

“Then relocate them,” Li proposed. “Transfer the slaves elsewhere. I’ll continue conditioning. Let Jiang linger here—it matters not.”

Magistrate Pang nodded. “An apt plan. Let’s move them while Jiang’s absent from the yamen.”

“Not so hastily!” Li objected. “I’ve yet to secure a location. Where would we hide them?”

“Your family estate is vast. Confine them there.”

“Absolutely not!” Li recoiled. “If my father discovers this, household discipline would be severe. I’ll find another site—you prepare the slaves. We’ll depart upon my return.”

Unbeknownst to them, Guanyu had overheard every word. Now understanding their vile trade—abducting women under guise of mountain demons, “conditioning” them through starvation and torture for sale as slaves—he retreated silently to rendezvous with Wang Jun.

“Well?” Wang Jun asked as Guanyu returned.

“Much discovered,” Guanyu murmured. “Let’s withdraw first.”

Approaching Liu Yun’s home, Guanyu blew Xiao Yuan’s bamboo whistle, imbuing the shrill note with inner energy. Soon, Liu Yun emerged with a bucket, allowing them to slip inside undetected.

“Any progress?” Liu Yun asked anxiously after they changed clothes.

Guanyu sat heavily. “Liu Yun... your husband was likely murdered by Magistrate Pang.”

“What?!” She paled. “Impossible! My husband inherited his father’s post—served the yamen faithfully for years! Everyone praised his integrity!”

“The ‘mountain demons’ abducting women,” Guanyu revealed, “are Pang and Li’s henchmen. No supernatural threat exists—only human greed.”

Liu Yun staggered, disbelief warring with dawning horror. Wang Jun confirmed, “We infiltrated the yamen. Heard their plans firsthand.”

Guanyu explained the scheme—women starved into submission, sold to wealthy buyers despite abolished slavery laws. “Forbidden trades thrive in shadows,” he noted. “Where demand exists, supply follows—especially with officials like Pang enabling it.”

Liu Yun whispered, “But you’re outsiders—why involve yourselves? Clashing with officials is dangerous!”

Wang Jun grinned. “Knowing Guanyu? He’ll see this through.”

Guanyu nodded grimly. “For your husband’s justice. For those enslaved women. We’ll expose this rot—but carefully.”

**Chapter 3864: Of Course We’ll Intervene**

They debated strategies—direct confrontation risked official retaliation, while anonymous tips moved too slowly. “We’ll feign departure,” Guanyu decided. “Make them complacent. Monitor their movements—catch them red-handed during transfer.”

Liu Yun pleaded, “Please, just leave! Don’t risk yourselves!”

“We’re already involved,” Wang Jun said. “Can’t abandon you now.”

Guanyu’s mind raced. As “Young Master Jiang,” his fabricated identity complicated matters. Assassinating Pang risked blame falling on the real Jiang family. Yet allowing more women to suffer was unthinkable.

“We’ll plant seeds of doubt,” he concluded. “Leak rumors to honest officials. Meanwhile, track the slave transfer—document evidence for exposure.”

Liu Yun, torn between hope and fear, whispered, “Thank you. But take care—the yamen’s roots run deep here.”

Guanyu smiled bleakly. “Evil persists everywhere. But so do those who oppose it.” As night deepened, plans solidified—a delicate dance between justice and survival, where every step risked catastrophe.
