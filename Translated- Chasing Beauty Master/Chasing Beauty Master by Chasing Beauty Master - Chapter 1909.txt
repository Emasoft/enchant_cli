The attitude of Chu Fan left Guan Yu feeling somewhat unsettled, prompting him to conclude their interaction. Since Duan Ruxue (Snow-like Duan) had invited him to the Duan Estate, he saw no reason to linger here any longer.

Upon arriving at the grand gates of the Duan Estate, Guan Yu was taken aback to find Duan Ruxue personally waiting to greet him. Such hospitality seemed excessive for someone of his status—he was no distinguished guest worthy of such ceremony.

“Younger Sister Ruxue, you look even more radiant today,” Guan Yu began with the timeless compliment all women adore.

Duan Ruxue appeared unusually casual today. In their previous encounters at the Wanyang Restaurant, she had always been impeccably dressed, exuding an air of nobility. Now, she wore a simple white dress with minimal adornments, her hair and face free of elaborate styling. Though understated, this simplicity lent her a fresh, approachable charm that Guan Yu found even more captivating.

“You flatter me, Brother Wan. Please, come inside!” Duan Ruxue replied with a smile, her eyes betraying the pleasure his praise had given her.

For Duan Ruxue to personally welcome someone at the estate gates was unprecedented in the capital. Her gesture not only honored Guan Yu but subtly elevated his standing in the eyes of onlookers.

As they walked side by side through the estate, Duan Ruxue asked, “Since this is your first visit, Brother Wan, what do you think of our home?”

Guan Yu surveyed the surroundings. “I’ve seen many grand mansions, each competing in opulence and scale. Yet the Duan Estate stands apart. While it may lack ostentation, its cleanliness and order leave a striking impression. Take that flowerbed, for instance.” He gestured toward a large arrangement along the corridor. “The blooms themselves are common, but their pruning and arrangement are exquisite—not a single withered leaf in sight. The gardener must cherish them deeply.”

His observations delighted Duan Ruxue, confirming her belief in his discerning eye. The flowers, she explained, were tended by her father, Master Duan, whose lifelong passion for horticulture manifested in unique species and meticulous designs that transformed ordinary plants into living art.

They arrived at the estate’s council hall, where a refreshing aroma—a blend of subtle florals and crisp mint—greeted them. Guan Yu noted potted plants by the windows, though the source of the fragrance remained intriguingly elusive.

“Father, this is the Wan Hong (Vast Magnificence) young master I’ve often mentioned,” Duan Ruxue introduced.

“Greetings, Master Duan.” Guan Yu bowed respectfully to the elder.

Rising from his seat, Master Duan warmly urged, “Please, Young Master Wan, be seated!” His eager hospitality suggested he had awaited this meeting with keen interest.

Chapter 5017: Impatient Reunion

As they settled into arranged chairs with tea served, Master Duan inquired, “Given our generational difference, I hope you’ll pardon my directness—does your homeland happen to be a place called Huaxia (Magnificent Xia)?”

The question startled Guan Yu. Few in this realm knew of Huaxia. “Indeed it is,” he confirmed.

“A different world entirely, I hear—one I’ve long wished to visit,” Master Duan mused. “Curiously, you’re not the only Huaxia native here. Our master tailor also hails from there.”

“The tailor Young Lady Ruxue mentioned?” Guan Yu’s interest sharpened.

“Precisely. His insights into your homeland’s innovations have been enlightening. When Ruxue wore those Huaxia-style garments you recognized, we suspected you might share origins.”

“I’ve yearned to meet him,” Guan Yu admitted. “To encounter a fellow countryman here would be...”

A knock interrupted them. The door opened to reveal a woman in a crisp white linen shirt and navy trousers—a stark contrast to local attire yet intimately familiar to Guan Yu. Their eyes locked in mutual shock.

“Feng Xihu (West Lake Feng)?” Guan Yu breathed, memories resurfacing: clandestine nights in the Feng manor, complicated tensions with her brother, her unrequited affections, and her eventual disappearance.

“Guan Yu? It’s been years.” She extended her hand, Western-style, before catching herself. “Apologies—Young Master Wan, correct? I’ve heard much about you.”

“A pleasure,” Guan Yu replied, clasping her hand. “Though our shared history might require... a more private setting to discuss.”

Chapter 5018: Reunion of Old Acquaintances

Feng Xihu’s composed demeanor barely concealed her turmoil. Once the pride of her family and Guan Yu’s thwarted admirer, she had vanished after failed attempts to reconcile him with her brother. Now here she stood—the Duan family’s celebrated tailor, her designs favored even by imperial consorts.

“When fellow countrymen meet, a day’s talk feels brief,” Guan Yu said tactfully to Master Duan. “With your permission, we might continue this reunion elsewhere.”

“By all means,” Master Duan agreed. “Madam Feng comes and goes freely here.”

As Feng Xihu withdrew, her lingering glance betrayed years of unresolved sentiment. Guan Yu mentally reviewed his cover—his Wan Hong alias remained secure unless her slip of his true name had aroused suspicion.

Unknown to him, Feng Xihu had followed his exploits as a rising Cloud Azure Sect disciple, dismissing them as coincidental until this moment. Her heart now raced with the implications—and the peril—of his true identity in this realm.
