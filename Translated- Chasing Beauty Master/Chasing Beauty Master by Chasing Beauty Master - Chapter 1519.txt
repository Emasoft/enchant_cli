Every cultivator dreams of obtaining Ironstone to forge magic tools, yet this material remains priceless and exceedingly rare.

The reason for Ironstone’s immense value lies in its unique properties. When refined into a magic tool, Ironstone surpasses materials of the same grade in potency, particularly in its unparalleled capacity to store spiritual energy.

Legend holds that a grand immortal once refined Ironstone into a celestial artifact—a feat requiring materials of the most exacting standards. That Ironstone could achieve this speaks volumes of its worth. While rarer materials might exist, their acquisition depends on sheer serendipity, whereas Ironstone’s supremacy in conventional use remains unchallenged.

However, Elder Wang currently knows Ironstone’s suitability only for crafting magic tools. Whether it can be used for crossbows remains uncertain, as he has only grasped the basic principles of crossbow construction. With no successful prototype yet, he dare not confirm its viability.

Nevertheless, the sheer quantity of Ironstone before him left Elder Wang restless, his eyes gleaming. Unfamiliar with the crossbow’s potential and lacking experimental data, he privately deemed it wasteful to use such precious material for crossbows—ordinary iron would suffice.

Eagerly, Elder Wang sought Guanyu to request a portion, hoping to justify his visit. Yet he was met with cold refusal. Guanyu’s retort implied that since Xuanming had invited them, any demands should be directed to the sect leader, not him.

Chuckling awkwardly, Elder Wang departed, assuming Guanyu—a junior disciple—lacked authority to distribute such treasures within the Cloud Azure Sect. Surely, Xuanming held sole discretion.

Undeterred, Elder Wang abandoned his tasks and hurried to Tiger Head Peak’s main hall. He resolved to petition Xuanming directly, determined to secure even the smallest fragment.

A mere sliver could be embedded in weapons as spiritual energy reservoirs—an invaluable enhancement.

Upon arrival, Xuanming received him courteously, rising to greet: *“Elder Wang, what matter brings you here? Speak freely.”*

Without preamble, Elder Wang declared: *“After examining the armor, I confirmed the shoulder and chest plates are Ironstone!”*

*“Ironstone? The entire shoulders?”* Xuanming sprang up, electrified. Elder Xiang, present for discussions about curing Xiao Zhi’s blood poison, also stood—both aware of Ironstone’s significance.

Xuanming had summoned Elder Xiang precisely to address this urgent matter, fearing Guanyu’s wrath if delays continued. The youth’s capabilities left no room for doubt—provoking him risked Elder Xiang’s life.

*“Fourteen pieces total,”* Elder Wang specified.

*“So many? Where are they? Show me!”* Elder Xiang interjected before Xuanming could respond. Despite decades in the sect, Elder Xiang lacked a satisfactory magic tool. His iron ruler, inadequate for his cultivated power, desperately needed upgrading—Ironstone presented a golden opportunity.

Xuanming watched Elder Xiang’s avaricious gleam with resignation. Fourteen pieces or fourteen hundred, Guanyu—bearing grudges—would never share with his adversary.

*“Inform Guanyu,”* Xuanming redirected. *“The armor is his.”*

*“I come humbly seeking a fragment,”* Elder Wang pressed. *“However precious, given the quantity... Consider it compensation for my efforts here.”*

Xuanming hesitated. While gifting a fragment to an allied sect seemed proper, the Ironstone belonged solely to Guanyu—the one person beyond Xuanming’s commands. Alienating him now, when his inventions promised revolutionary advancements, was unthinkable.

*“You must ask Guanyu,”* Xuanming deflected.

*“Nonsense!”* Elder Xiang erupted. *“Such treasures shouldn’t belong to that brat! Claim them for the sect!”*

Xuanming glared. *“Do you truly believe Guanyu would surrender them? Even if he did, you’d gain nothing. Your feud ensures that.”*

Elder Wang, dignity bruised by this evasion, flushed with humiliation. Relenting, Xuanming offered: *“I’ll approach Guanyu, but cannot guarantee success.”*

With forced gratitude, Elder Wang departed, seething at feeling manipulated.

**Chapter 3940: A Major Incident**

*“Why delay?”* Elder Xiang urged post-departure. *“Reclaim the Ironstone! It belongs to the sect!”*

*“Cease your scheming,”* Xuanming rebuked. *“Guanyu won’t comply. Even if he did, you’d gain nothing. Now—your wager with him. When will you cure Xiao Zhi?”*

Elder Xiang scoffed. *“A jest! He injured me with trickery. I’ll never aid his lackey!”*

Xuanming frowned at this dishonor. *“The entire sect witnessed your bet. Defy it, and face Guanyu’s retaliation.”*

*“Let him try!”* Elder Xiang sneered. *“I fear no junior!”*

Shaking his head at such shamelessness, Xuanming changed tack as Elder Xiang reported: *“The Demon Soul Sect grows bolder. Our desert disciples suffer heavy losses. We must act!”*

*“Indeed,”* Xuanming agreed. *“But withdrawing from the Eight-Sided Drum pursuit is impossible. We need veterans there, not novices.”*

*“Worse—the Demon Lord stole the Myriad Phenomena Disk from Red Lotus Sect using a Millennium Fire Gu!”*

Xuanming started. *“A Fire Gu? Those require volcanic caverns in the demon realm! Capturing one awake is impossible!”*

*“It must be dormant,”* Elder Xiang deduced. *“Once awakened, only its subduer can command it.”*

*“We must ally with Red Lotus Sect against them,”* Xuanming concluded. *“But whom to send? Our veterans are occupied.”*

Seizing the chance, Elder Xiang proposed: *“Send Guanyu. Let him prove his worth in the desert.”*

Xuanming saw through this ploy—banishing his rival into danger. *“Guanyu’s current project is vital. His inventions could revolutionize our strength.”*

**Chapter 3941: Winning Hearts**

*“Abandon our disciples then?”* Elder Xiang challenged. *“Surrender the Eight-Sided Drum?”*

Torn, Xuanming wavered. The desert crisis demanded action, yet Guanyu’s breakthroughs promised greater rewards. Elder Xiang’s ulterior motive—to remove Guanyu—hung unspoken but clear.

Meanwhile, Guanyu’s shadow loomed over all calculations—his grudges, inventions, and unpredictable nature rendering every decision precarious. The sect’s future pivoted on balancing these volatile elements, where treasures and treachery intertwined like the gears of fate.
