At that time, not only would the defensive capabilities be extraordinary, but even the damage reflection would compete. After the previous battle, Guan Yu had become more meticulous in his research of shields. He found the damage reflection function of the shield particularly promising and planned to delve deeper into this ability.

The shield would eventually become transparent, meaning an invisible protective barrier would surround him. Through testing, Guan Yu discovered that the shield’s damage reflection operated by rebounding a percentage of incoming attacks.

The beige-colored shield currently reflected approximately 35% of incoming damage. Guan Yu wondered how much the reflection percentage would increase once the shield turned transparent—a question that deeply intrigued him.

If the damage reflection percentage rose significantly, Guan Yu could defeat opponents without lifting a finger during battles, relying solely on the shield’s反弹 as long as it remained intact.

In terms of cultivation, however, Guan Yu had made no progress. The seal within his body proved difficult to break, and under its influence, his cultivation level remained stagnant. No matter how diligently he trained, only the shield continued to evolve slowly.

The assassin Guan Yu had encountered earlier was indeed not sent by the Feng family. As he suspected, it was Ma He—the older brother of Ma Hai.

Enraged upon learning of his younger brother’s death, Ma He initially believed Guan Yu to be no match for him. He resolved to avenge his brother but was unexpectedly injured by Guan Yu’s shield detonation.

News of the assassination attempt soon reached the Feng family. Seizing the opportunity, Young Master Feng sought out Ma He, meeting him in a VIP room of an upscale club.

The room’s lavish decor featured exclusively branded furniture in a European-American style. Seated gracefully beside an exorbitantly priced jade table, Young Master Feng had a scantily clad woman bouncing rhythmically on his lap.

Soon, a servant announced, “Young Master, Ma He has arrived.”

“Bring him in at once,” Young Master Feng commanded, shoving the woman away and muttering irritably, “Damn it, interrupting me at the crucial moment.”

After straightening his clothes, Young Master Feng rose just as a burly man strode through the door. The man cast a disdainful glance at him and rasped in broken Mandarin, “You. Why. Call me?”

Knowing the man’s prowess, Young Master Feng plastered on an ingratiating smile, his jowls nearly reaching his ears. “Ah, Brother Ma He! Forgive my lack of hospitality. Please, take a seat!”

Ma He understood the Feng family’s formidable influence in City A. He had agreed to meet after being told of their shared enemy—Guan Yu. With a common foe, alliances formed easily. Moreover, his recent skirmish with Guan Yu had revealed the latter’s unexpected resilience. After recovering from his injuries, partnering with the Fengs seemed advantageous.

Nodding curtly, Ma He sat by the jade table. Once tea was served, Young Master Feng remarked, “Ma He, elder brother of Ma Hai. Failed to avenge your brother, suffered grave injuries.”

Ma He’s face darkened. “You. Mocking me?”

“Of course not!” Young Master Feng chuckled. “We share a mutual enemy. Guan Yu and I have an irreconcilable vendetta. By joining forces, we can end him. You’ll avenge your brother, and I’ll rest easy.”

“Why collaborate?” Ma He sneered. “I can handle him alone.” Unfazed, Young Master Feng replied, “True, but with difficulty. If he were easy to kill, I’d have done it myself. You might have an 80% chance alone—I’ll add the remaining 20%.”

Chapter 2146: The Exquisite Dagger

Ma He knew cooperation with the Fengs offered only benefits. His sole concern was vengeance. “Why help me?” he demanded.

Pouring tea, Young Master Feng answered, “A small request. The Feng family admires your skills. Serve us, and our power grows. Become my personal guard—with you, I’d fear nothing.”

Ma He, however, was a lone wolf—an internationally renowned assassin who despised constraints. “Impossible,” he retorted.

“No restraints,” Young Master Feng pressed. “Pursue your interests freely. Just assist when needed.”

The Fengs had long plotted against Guan Yu, even considering hiring pricey international assassins. A recent encounter with a Japanese woman skilled in seductive arts had briefly tempted Young Master Feng to use her against Guan Yu, but the plan was abandoned due to Guan Yu’s entourage of women.

Another scheme involved planting a spy as Guan Yu’s housemaid, but the idea was thwarted when Guan Yu’s female companions vetoed hiring help.

After Guan Yu’s café assassination attempt, Young Master Feng tracked down Ma He, who made no effort to hide. Confident in his abilities, Ma He saw no need for stealth.

“I take no orders. If nothing else, I leave,” Ma He declared, rising.

“Wait!” Young Master Feng countered. “You’re drowning in gambling debts. Serve me, and I’ll clear them. Your future earnings will surpass assassination pay.”

The offer gave Ma He pause. Financial freedom and autonomy were tempting. Noticing his hesitation, Young Master Feng added, “Aligning with the Fengs brings prestige without compromising your freedom.”

Ma He drained his scalding tea in one gulp, startling Young Master Feng. “I’ll consider it after Guan Yu’s death,” he finally said.

Suppressing fury at the conditional acceptance, Young Master Feng shifted tactics. “How will you assist me against Guan Yu?”

“I’ll lure him to a secluded spot,” Young Master Feng explained, producing an ornate dagger from a box. “And gift you this.”

The dagger’s hilt concealed a micro-pistol trigger—a hybrid weapon. Ma He, a dagger specialist, examined it disdainfully. “I won’t use this trash,” he scoffed, returning it. To him, true warriors relied on skill, not gadgets.

Masking his contempt, Young Master Feng laughed. “Of course! Your prowess needs no tricks.” Privately, he cursed Ma He’s hypocrisy—hadn’t the man ambushed Guan Yu before?

Chapter 2147: Agreement Reached

“Very well,” Young Master Feng conceded. “I’ll isolate Guan Yu for you. Succeed, and I’ll clear your debts. Afterwards, you’ll work for me—generous pay, no strings.”

The deal appealed to Ma He. “Agreed,” he nodded. Post-discussion, Young Master Feng spoiled him with women and luxury accommodations.

While Ma He indulged, Young Master Feng monitored Guan Yu’s movements. Reports indicated Guan Yu frequented the Hua Ye Club and was close to its manager.

“Any other patterns?” Young Master Feng pressed.

“He spends days at Hua Ye, returns to Qiaoyuan District otherwise. Their security’s tight—we can’t approach,” the subordinate replied.

Pondering in his European-style study, Young Master Feng struggled to devise a lure. Targeting Guan Yu’s women was too risky. Then inspiration struck—Wei Hongwei.

At Kaihuang High, Wei Hongwei slept soundly in class. Teacher Pan Xiaoxia ignored him—ever since he’d discovered her intimate moment with Guan Yu and blackmailed her into leniency.

During lunch, Wei Hongwei and friend Jia Bo headed off-campus when a stranger called out. “Elder Brother Wei, wait!”

Turning, Wei Hongwei eyed the unfamiliar student. “What?” he asked, assuming a recruitment pitch for the Yu Gang.
