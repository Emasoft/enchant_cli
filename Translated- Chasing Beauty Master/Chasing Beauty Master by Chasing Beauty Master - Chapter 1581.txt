Wang Xiaorong cheerfully finished ordering food and asked, "Did you find anything tasty outside earlier? If so, let's eat less here and save room for later."

For women, food constitutes half their life's joy. Generally speaking, women relish eating more than men, savoring diverse flavors. Once they find something delectable, they'll never tire of it.

Like Xue Jing and Lü Mei, Wang Xiaorong belonged to that enviable category of women who could indulge endlessly without gaining weight. She ate freely, unburdened by concerns over her figure.

Xue Jing, for her part, could afford such liberty because if she ever gained weight, she'd simply regulate her intake or circulate her internal energy to rapidly metabolize fat, thus maintaining her slender form.

Lü Mei, however, was the true marvel—renowned for her bottomless appetite and peerless physique. No matter how much she ate, her figure remained impeccable, the subject of widespread envy.

Zhang Han also enjoyed nonstop eating, her plump yet perfectly proportioned frame defying conventional logic. Though rounded, she carried no excess flab—ample where it mattered, trim elsewhere—a genetic blessing many coveted.

To Zhang Han, eating was life itself. Despite her soft curves, she never grew heavier, remaining perpetually unchanged—a phenomenon that left other women green with envy.

Within Qiaoyuan District, the most envious of Lü Mei and Zhang Han were Amei and Yingzi. These two dared not overindulge, knowing any excess would immediately show on their figures.

They could only sigh resignedly as Lü Mei and Zhang Han nibbled snacks idly, powerless to emulate their carefree habits.

Wang Xiaorong shared this gastronomic passion. Despite her ravenous appetite, she maintained a willowy, girlish silhouette—every woman's dream—devouring mountains of food while retaining flawless proportions.

This time, Wang Xiaorong ordered enough for three, likely more than they could finish. Guan Yu glanced at the straw-hatted figure behind them. Though uncertain of the stalker's identity, he'd sensed surveillance since leaving the inn.

Having trailed them this far without revealing intentions, the shadow clearly meant to observe. Guan Yu pretended unawareness, biding his time to assess the situation.

When their table finally became available, Guan Yu steered Wang Xiaorong toward the second floor instead of seating themselves.

"What are you doing? Our food's ready!" Wang Xiaorong protested curiously as he led her upstairs.

"You'll see," Guan Yu replied, guiding her along the corridor before ducking into a corner to watch their pursuer ascend.

Stepping out abruptly, Guan Yu demanded, "Who are you? State your purpose!"

Caught off-guard, the figure turned to flee. Guan Yu drew his pistol, barking, "Move another inch, and I shoot!"

**Chapter 4100: Too Obvious**

Few understood the lethality of Guan Yu's firearm. Having been tailed so persistently, Guan Yu suspected someone familiar—likely sent by Prince Zou.

An ignorant pursuer might disregard the pistol's threat, but this one froze in palpable fear. Seeing concealment futile, the figure removed its hat.

"Brother Left Envoy?" Wang Xiaorong gaped, astonished to find their shadow was none other than the Demon Soul Sect's Left Envoy.

Guan Yu shook his head wryly. "I sensed a familiar presence, hence held my fire. But Left Envoy—why let yourself be discovered?"

The Left Envoy smirked. "Nothing escapes you, Guan Yu. Your disguises are impeccable."

Wang Xiaorong frowned. "Did Father order this surveillance?"

"None but my own concern," the Left Envoy admitted. "When the Demon Lord proposed covert guards for you, you both refused. I took it upon myself to ensure your safety."

"If protection was your aim," Guan Yu countered, "why make your presence so obvious?"

"Merely keeping pace," the Left Envoy deflected. "Your plain attire risks losing you in crowds. Closer tracking seemed prudent—yet you detected me regardless."

"Your dedication is noted," Guan Yu stated firmly. "But withdraw now. I've sworn to protect Xiaorong with my life. Your services are unnecessary."

Wang Xiaorong added, "This sneaking about is unseemly, Brother. If truly worried, join us openly in guarding Prince Zou."

"Unnecessary," the Left Envoy declined. "Having witnessed Guan Yu's capabilities, I'll report your safety to the Demon Lord."

As he departed, the Left Envoy wrestled with conflicting loyalties. Yan Zhao's forces prepared to ambush Prince Zou—a mission accepted before knowing Guan Yu's involvement. Now, with the young mistress embedded in the prince's retinue, complications multiplied.

Exposing Guan Yu's identity would endanger Wang Xiaorong further. The Left Envoy could only pray Yan Zhao's group would abandon the mission, feigning incapacity against Prince Zou's defenses.

Afterward, Wang Xiaorong asked, "How did you notice him? I detected nothing!"

"Too obvious," Guan Yu chuckled, leading her downstairs to dine.

**Chapter 4101: Scram**

After a day's tedious exploration of Mingwen City—notable only for its proliferation of brothels and inns—the pair returned exhausted to Prince Zou's lodgings. Guan Yu noted fifty-odd recruits gathered outside, some genuine martial artists, others mere opportunists.

Captain screened candidates through sparring matches, weeding out incompetents while offering tiered payments. A few pretenders slunk away after witnessing his prowess, though some lingered hoping for undeserved rewards.

Deeming the selection process adequate, Guan Yu retired without intervention.

Dawn found Wang Xiaorong rousing Guan Yu with washwater. "Rise! The prince's caravan assembles. Eat quickly—we depart soon."

Bleary-eyed, Guan Yu complied. Over breakfast, Wang Xiaorong examined her crossbow gift.

"I have a question," she began. "Must I load bolts each time? Can't I keep them preloaded?"

"Absolutely not," Guan Yu explained. "Without a safety lock, carrying loaded risks accidental discharge. Moreover, keeping the bowstring tensioned damages the sinews. Most crucially, those mercury-coated bolts are toxic—prolonged contact endangers you."

"Understood," Wang Xiaorong conceded. "I'll not risk damaging my treasure."

Outside, the expanded caravan impressed—sixty strong, including forty new hires supposedly surpassing regular soldiers in skill. Prince Zou's relief was palpable.

Wang Jun approached teasingly. "Sightseeing yesterday, eh?"

"Boring beyond belief!" Wang Xiaorong pouted.

"Nonsense!" Wang Jun countered. "Mingwen boasts numerous attractions—didn't Guan Yu show you?"

As Wang Xiaorong turned accusatory eyes, Guan Yu snapped, "Scram, troublemaker! I'm new here myself!"

Chuckling, Wang Jun withdrew as the caravan commenced its journey toward Fugu Town—a mountainous region ripe for ambush, yet unavoidable on the shortest route to the capital.

Prince Zou urged haste. "Quick march! Reach Wujian Mountain's base by nightfall."

**Chapter 4102: No Exaggeration**

Curious, Guan Yu asked about their destination.

"Wujian Mountain houses the Wujian Inn," Wang Xiaorong explained. "A gathering place for martial artists—risky for royalty. The mountain's fame stems from Wujian Manor, home to the undefeated Swordless Immortal—revered as the realm's supreme martial artist for decades."

"So formidable?" Guan Yu marveled.

"Without exaggeration," Wang Xiaorong affirmed. "His reputation shakes the entire Jianghu. The Swordless Immortal's might is legend."

"Elaborate," Guan Yu pressed, intrigued.

"In the Wujian Manor resides a man who abandoned steel yet reigns unchallenged. For forty years, none have bested him in combat. His mere name commands fear across the martial world."
