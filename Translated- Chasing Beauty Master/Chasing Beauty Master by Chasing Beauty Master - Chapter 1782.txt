“But none of us are fools,” Elder Zhao interjected at this moment. “While I did propose this competition, I never set any specific rules. You can’t just spout nonsense. If I picked up a branch from the ground and claimed it was a treasure that could potentially become a high-grade magical artifact after refinement, would you accept such a claim?”

Guan Yu couldn’t help but admire Elder Zhao’s eloquence, though it was clear he was resorting to sophistry. Feeling a sense of injustice, Guan Yu spoke up.

“Elder Zhao, that’s hardly a fair comparison,” Guan Yu said. “Let me make this clear—I’m not siding with either party here. But I must speak truthfully: everyone present must acknowledge that the True Sun Sect elder truly possesses a precious jade. Even the Red Lotus Sect disciples should admit this.

“Even before refinement, this jade should be considered a treasure, much like the Blood Stone. We all know both will become extraordinary artifacts after refinement.

“But Elder Zhao’s analogy with a branch is utterly forced. If the Blood Stone or this jade were dropped on the ground, anyone who saw them would eagerly pick them up, ecstatic at finding such treasures. Would anyone bother with a discarded branch? That’s the difference.”

Guan Yu’s lengthy rebuttal served two purposes: first, to subtly aid the True Sun Sect, whose members he found more agreeable. While he couldn’t vouch for their moral character, their conduct so far seemed respectable.

Second, he aimed to stall for time. The sun had already set, and according to the True Sun elder, darkness would trigger their immediate expulsion from this realm. If that happened now, Guan Yu could claim the Blood Stone for himself—a priceless opportunity.

Yet a question nagged him: Why did the True Sun elder alone know about this expulsion mechanism? Neither the Red Lotus Sect nor the Demon Soul Sect’s Right Envoy seemed aware, hence their frantic search for exits.

Perhaps it wasn’t surprising, Guan Yu reasoned. The True Sun Sect boasted many seasoned elders who specialized in obscure research. Their knowledge of Miao City’s secrets might stem from generations of study.

Elder Zhao seethed with resentment toward Guan Yu. Despite claiming neutrality, Guan Yu clearly favored the True Sun Sect.

“If this is deliberate collusion,” Elder Zhao sneered, “there’s no point continuing this farce. I’ll never accept that trinket as a valid entry!”

With neither side willing to yield, the True Sun elder retorted, “Very well. Since you insist, Elder Zhao, let us settle this by force. The Demon Soul Sect members must be distant by now.”

Tensions escalated as both factions prepared to clash again—a development Guan Yu welcomed, as conflict increased his chances of securing the Blood Stone.

The Red Lotus elder snorted coldly. Having regained some spiritual energy, he barked, “Do you think the Red Lotus Sect fears you? Enough talk—let’s fight!”

He raised his hand, shouting, “Disciples! Deploy the Second Formation!”

Guan Yu started. The Red Lotus Sect’s aggression surprised him—they transitioned to combat within moments. The True Sun Sect readied their defenses, recalling their previous encounter where wind shields had neutralized the Red Lotus’s ice barrage.

Xiao Mei whispered nervously, “Guan Yu, can the True Sun Sect withstand this? That formation looks terrifying.”

“Unclear,” Guan Yu replied, glancing at the darkening sky. Time was critical—if the Red Lotus’s attack took too long to charge, expulsion might occur mid-battle.

The True Sun elder sensed the impending danger. As his disciples reinforced their shields, Guan Yu noted the plummeting temperature—frost already crusted nearby trees.

A transparent ice wall encased the Red Lotus fighters, likely protecting them during their spellcasting. Above them, a dark crystalline mass grew—a massive obsidian ice block gleaming lethally in the fading light.

“This spell is formidable,” Guan Yu muttered. “That ice could devastate the True Sun ranks.”

Panicked, the True Sun elder shattered a mysterious object, summoning an energy-absorbing orb. Disciples channeled their power into it, preparing an unknown countermeasure.

Guan Yu hoped for mutual annihilation—their clash might grant him the Blood Stone. But then a new voice cut through the tension:

“What’s happening here?”

The Demon Soul Sect’s Right Envoy had returned, drawn by the gathering energy. Her arrival complicated everything—both sects were vulnerable mid-casting.

Spotting Guan Yu, she demanded, “Are they fighting over the Eight-Sided Drum technique?”

Guan Yu revealed the Blood Stone. “They’re squabbling over this trinket. Care to watch the spectacle, Auntie Right Envoy?”

Her eyes glinted with desire, though she scoffed, “Pathetic—such greed over a mere stone.”

“Exactly,” Guan Yu pressed. “Surely the mighty Demon Soul Sect wouldn’t stoop to claiming this?”

“You underestimate its value,” she countered coldly. “Acquiring it now would be... convenient.”

Guan Yu tensed. The situation grew more volatile by the second.

The True Sun Sect focused purely on defense, prioritizing survival over counterattacks. Guan Yu respected their restraint, contrasting it with the Red Lotus’s reckless avarice.

As the icy assault intensified, Guan Yu shepherded his companions to safety. “Stay behind me,” he assured, confident in his ability to shield them.

His true concern remained the Blood Stone. Open theft would invite retaliation, but chaos might provide cover. If the timed expulsion occurred during battle, he could blame the realm’s mechanisms.

The Right Envoy’s covetous gaze didn’t escape Guan Yu. He needed to dissuade her without provoking conflict. “This pebble isn’t worth your attention,” he insisted, downplaying its significance.

Yet everyone knew the truth—the Blood Stone’s power made it worth any risk. As the two sects’ spells neared completion, Guan Yu braced for the storm, his mind racing through scenarios to claim his prize amidst the coming chaos.
