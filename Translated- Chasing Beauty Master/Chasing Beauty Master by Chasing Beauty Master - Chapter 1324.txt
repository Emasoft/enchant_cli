“I think this is the way to go,” Guan Yu said. “When you return, find time to ask your uncle about how this Steward Sun came to be. Make sure no one’s around when you ask, to avoid raising suspicions.”

Xiao Zhi glanced at Guan Yu with mild boredom. “Very well. I understand your suggestion and trust your judgment. To ensure my uncle’s safety, I’ll definitely get to the bottom of this.”

The matter of the steward would have to wait until after proper inquiries. For now, Guan Yu’s main concern was deciding where to discard the jade octagram pendant he carried.

If carelessly tossed aside, it might truly vanish. For the Red Lotus Sect to find it would be like fishing a needle from the ocean—an act that felt somewhat unscrupulous.

Xiao Zhi suddenly suggested, “Guan Yu, A’Ze, why don’t I take you somewhere interesting?”

Seeing Xiao Zhi’s mischievous grin, A’Ze smiled and pointed at him. “I knew it. You’ve clearly familiarized yourself with this place.”

“It’s not about familiarity—I only heard of this spot yesterday evening. Come, since we’ve time to spare, let’s unwind.” Xiao Zhi tugged Guan Yu and A’Ze forward with renewed vigor.

Before Guan Yu could ask their destination, they arrived at an imposing multi-story pavilion. A grand plaque above the entrance declared: *Huiyin Lou*.

“Huiyin Lou? What kind of place is this?” Guan Yu studied the ornate structure.

Xiao Zhi chuckled. “A newly opened paradise offering exactly what men like us desire. Let’s hurry inside—heh heh heh!”

Upon entering, Guan Yu immediately grasped the establishment’s nature. Unless mistaken, this was a brothel—though presented with more refinement than most.

“You’re bringing me here? Do I look like some vulgar degenerate?” Guan Yu feigned indignation. Despite moral reservations, he couldn’t deny the allure of such surroundings.

“Stop pretending!” Xiao Zhi retorted. “You’re misunderstanding! This is Qujiang City’s famed Huiyin Lou—home to master musicians and breathtaking beauties. Men come here to unwind, enjoy wine, and listen to melodies. What’s improper about that?”

Guan Yu shook his head ruefully. Perhaps he’d misjudged. Though the lavish decor suggested darker transactions beneath the surface, the immediate atmosphere was one of cultured entertainment.

“Fine. If it’s music we’re here for, let’s enjoy it.” Guan Yu relented with a smile.

The trio entered a spacious hall reminiscent of modern theaters—a central atrium surrounded by tiered balconies. Guan Yu counted four levels in total.

A comely young hostess approached with a curtsy. “Honored guests, have you reserved seating?”

“No reservation. Secure us the finest available,” Xiao Zhi declared, unconcerned about costs. With Siqi absent, he intended to indulge fully.

As they followed the hostess, commotion erupted from the second floor.

“Cheap whore! I pay good money and you dare play chaste?” A richly dressed nobleman brandished a jade hairpin and white fan toward a chamber. “You’re just another harlot pretending to virtue!”

Guan Yu instantly understood—a courtesan refusing carnal service, provoking her drunken patron.

Madam Xi Liu hurried over, her practiced smile masking tension. “Young Master Men, please calm yourself! Why trouble over trifles?”

“Trifles?!” The nobleman thrust out his bleeding forearm. “Look! The bitch bit me! I demand recompense!”

From below, Guan Yu observed distinct tooth marks. The girl’s resistance had been fierce—nearly tearing flesh.

Madam Xi Liu maintained her composure. “Allow me to arrange more accommodating company. Cuihua is young and inexperienced—”

“Five times I’ve paid!” Men bellowed. “Enough to buy a harem! Yet she dares reject me?!”

The hostess whispered, “Gentlemen, shall we proceed to your seats?”

“We’ll watch this drama first,” Guan Yu replied, eyes fixed on the confrontation.

Xiao Zhi murmured, “That’s Men Ershao—City Governor’s second son. No wonder he struts unchecked.”

Above, Men Ershao staggered toward Madam Xi Liu. “Your rules? I’ll break them today! That girl leaves with me!”

“Men Ershao,” the madam countered coldly, “though your father governs Qujiang, our establishment answers to higher authorities. Guards—prepare a carriage for our guest’s departure!”

When attendants moved to escort him, Men Ershao kicked a lackey. “Fool! Fetch reinforcements!”

The henchman bolted downstairs—only to trip over Guan Yu’s outstretched foot.

“Clumsy oaf!” Guan Yu seized the thug’s collar. “Apologize for your clumsiness!”

Men Ershao stormed down, face purple with rage. “Who dares block my man?!”

“Your cur collided with me,” Guan Yu stated coolly. “Shall we discuss manners?”

“Manners?!” The nobleman spat. “I’ll have you arrested!”

Guan Yu’s slap sent the lackey sprawling, teeth scattering. “Dogs reflect their masters. How poorly your house trains its hounds.”

Men Ershao recoiled, calculating odds. “Mark my words! My father’s guards will—”

“Stay,” Guan Yu blocked his exit. “First, your apology.”

From above, a pale-faced Cuihua emerged—her delicate features explaining Men Ershao’s obsession. At fifteen or sixteen, her beauty outshone the establishment’s finery.

“You’ll regret this!” Men Ershao threatened, though fear tempered his bluster.

Guan Yu smiled icily. “A city governor’s brat lacks standing to threaten me. Leave now—if you value intact bones.”
