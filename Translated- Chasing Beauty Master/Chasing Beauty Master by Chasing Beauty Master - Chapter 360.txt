“Uncle Wu, you’ve arrived just in time! There are two troublemakers here causing a nuisance. I hope you can give me a proper explanation!”

Sun Mande glared resentfully at Guan Yu and Jiang Ziqi, his eyes filled with deep apprehension, not daring to act rashly!

He called him “Uncle Wu” because of the connection between Sun Mande’s grandfather, Sun Chenglin, and Wu Bao. Wu Bao held Sun Chenglin in high esteem; otherwise, with Sun Mande’s status, how could he swagger around in a private room named after the renowned “Pinming Tea House”?

It was precisely this that inflated Sun Mande’s arrogance to an extreme degree, making him look down on everyone!

“Mande, let this matter rest. Say no more, and do not act impulsively again. I’ll take responsibility for all your losses. Listen to me and go to the hospital immediately for treatment!” Wu Bao said indifferently.

Sun Mande froze, his face filled with disbelief. Pointing at himself, he shrilled, “Uncle Wu, look! I’m the one who was beaten and injured. How can we just drop this? No! I absolutely refuse!”

“I’ll make them pay double for the humiliation I’ve suffered!”

Sun Mande glared furiously at Guan Yu and the other, his eyes blazing with rage.

His rationality was completely buried under anger; he failed to grasp the deeper implications of Wu Bao’s words.

Wu Bao’s expression turned impatient. He waved his hand, cutting off Sun Mande’s rant, and coldly said, “Sun Mande, I’m telling you this out of respect for your grandfather’s past kindness. If you persist in this foolishness, don’t blame me for banishing you from the club and blacklisting you!”

“Go ahead! I don’t care!” Sun Mande roared.

He was too enraged to heed Wu Bao’s threat. But after speaking, seeing Wu Bao’s darkening face, he sensed something amiss.

Wu Bao was not someone to provoke lightly.

Sun Mande hastily backtracked, “Uncle Wu, I didn’t mean that. I—”

Wu Bao cut him off with a wave. “From today, you’re blacklisted from Pinming. Leave now while I still remember your grandfather’s kindness, or I’ll have you thrown out!”

Sun Mande was stunned. Only now did he realize he’d kicked an iron plate—a very hard one.

Cold sweat poured down his back as panic surged within him.

“Xiao Luo, throw him out!” Wu Bao ordered.

“Wait!” Guan Yu suddenly interjected.

The guards halted. Sun Mande, now terrified, couldn’t meet Guan Yu’s gaze.

Guan Yu turned to Wu Bao, annoyed. “You stole my lines! Now I’ve got nothing left to say!”

Wu Bao awkwardly smiled, remaining silent.

“But I’ll admit, you’re more tactful than Jiang Ziqi here!” Guan宇 added, leaving Wu宝 nervously smiling.

Sun Mande, witnessing this, felt a chill. Who had he provoked?

“You threatened to ruin Xixi?” Guan宇 asked.

Sun Mande forced a smile. “I... I was joking.”

Guan宇 stared intently. “No, you were serious.”

Sun Mande’s heart pounded. Finally, he knelt, begging, “Please spare me!”

Guan宇 smiled. “I’m generous—but not that generous.”

Sun Mande collapsed, defeated.

Guan宇’s goal was to protect Li Xi. Now, seeing Sun Mande’s terror, he knew the message was clear.

“Will you still target Li Xi’s company?” Guan宇 pressed.

Sun Mande shook his head frantically. “Never! I’ll convince my grandfather to support her company!”

Guan宇 finally smiled. “Good. Now get lost.”

Sun Mande, carried out by friends, left in disgrace.

Jiang Ziqi watched, conflicted. He’d underestimated Guan宇’s cunning.

Guan宇 patted Jiang Ziqi’s shoulder. “Well done. Keep it up.”

Jiang Ziqi suppressed his rage, departing silently.

Later, Li Xi asked, “Who was that man?”

“Jiang Ziqi, a rising star of the Jiang family,” Guan宇 replied.

Li Xi’s eyes widened. The Jiang family—a true powerhouse. Jiang Ziqi, a potential heir, now under Guan宇’s thumb?

Guan宇’s power grew ever more enigmatic.
