“Actually, this problem is quite solvable. Your... your family just thinks it's dangerous for you to follow me and that you'll pick up bad habits. As long as we can change their prejudice against me, you won’t need to transfer schools or return to the capital, and your family won’t force you anymore, right?” Guan Yu sniffed and said vaguely.

“Mhm, mhm...” Du Xiaojuan nodded her little head like a woodpecker.

“So... I need to prove to your family that I, Guan Yu, am not some scoundrel who seduces young girls. I want to make money! I want everyone to see me in a new light.” Guan Yu declared solemnly. The first half referred to Du Xiaojuan’s family, while the latter half—about everyone re-evaluating him—was directed at neighbors, relatives, and all who knew him.

“Mhm... I believe you can! You’re the best!” Du Xiaojuan grinned, flattering him like a little sycophant, her carefree demeanor utterly guileless.

“Of course! Your bro here has to be the best!” Guan Yu lifted his chin and chuckled.

The jade business... He wanted to start there, but... he knew nothing about jade! Not a single clue! How could he dive into this industry? Besides, with just a few million, even opening a small jade shop would strain their operating funds, let alone scaling it up.

“Huh?” Guan Yu suddenly turned to Du Xiaojuan. “Your dad deals in jade, right? Including jadeite and agate?”

“Jadeite... that’s super expensive! I’ve heard you need tens of millions in operating funds. My dad relies on bank loans. I don’t really know how it works!” Du Xiaojuan shrugged helplessly. She’d never cared about her family’s business operations before. If only she’d paid attention earlier, now that Guan Yu wanted to enter this field! She inwardly cursed her past self.

“As long as he’s involved, that’s good enough!” Guan Yu slapped his thigh excitedly.

Stone gambling—no longer mysterious thanks to TV and novels—had become fiercely competitive in the jadeite raw stone trade. This high-risk, high-reward business might deter others, but Guan Yu brimmed with confidence.

This was the fast track to wealth! Far more reliable than gambling. After all, gambling meant taking money from others. Winning occasionally was fine, but making it a livelihood would only breed resentment and invite trouble.

Why hadn’t he thought of this sooner? Guan Yu rubbed his hands eagerly. Two or three million should suffice... With his detection skill to see inside the raw stones, identifying jadeite quality and size... he’d strike it rich!

Once he procured several high-end jadeites worth millions or tens of millions, he’d make a name for himself in the jade circle. Her family would have to take notice!

That’s it! The more Guan Yu pondered, the more feasible it seemed. He excitedly explained the plan to Du Xiaojuan.

However, the silly girl had never heard of stone gambling. After Guan Yu’s lengthy explanation, her eyes sparkled as she grabbed his right hand. “Ooh, this sounds fun!”

“But... since it’s gambling, there’s winning and losing. You... you’re not as skilled as you are at cards. What if we lose everything? What then?” Du Xiaojuan asked pitifully, her voice small.

“That... probably won’t happen!” Guan Yu scratched his head and laughed casually. How could he explain? Tell her he could see inside the stones? With her loose lips, she’d blab immediately! This wasn’t child’s play.

Chapter 184: Sleeping Together

When Guan Yu fell silent, Du Xiaojuan tilted her head thoughtfully. “How about... we first secure our living arrangements, then use the remaining money to gamble?”

“How?”

“Staying in hotels isn’t sustainable! Let’s rent an apartment, settle down, keep some living expenses. Luo Cheng’s businesses will open soon anyway—we won’t starve. The rest can go to stone gambling! If we lose it all, we’ll just return to card games!” Du Xiaojuan laid out her logic finger by finger.

Guan Yu stared at her in astonishment. Since when did this airhead become so money-savvy? Was it innate?

“Why are you looking at me like that?” Du Xiaojuan pouted.

“Senior, why don’t you manage our future expenses?”

“Really? Can I?” Her eyes lit up as she tentatively asked.

“Of course!” Guan Yu replied casually.

Delighted, Du Xiaojuan nodded vigorously. “I can do this! Not a single cent will go to waste! I’ve saved over a hundred thousand from my college allowance these past years! My little treasury... well, until...” Her face fell, and she trailed off.

Guan Yu chuckled, pulling her close. “Relax... it’s just a few hundred thousand. Soon you’ll handle millions, tens of millions, even billions. How’s that?”

“Really? You... trust me that much? Not afraid I’ll run off with your money?” She blinked her glittering eyes.

“You? Have the cunning for that?”

“Hmph... mocking me again?” She pouted angrily, though her eyes danced with mirth. Being trusted—especially by Guan Yu—filled her with joy. She’d suggested renting to create a homey nest. Living together like a married couple, nestled in their little den... even staying in forever sounded blissful!

Of course, Guan Yu misunderstood, thinking her frugal nature recoiled at hotel expenses. His opinion of her as a penny-pincher deepened.

Though reluctant, Guan Yu acquiesced. Du Xiaojuan, ever impulsive, immediately summoned Niu Le to hunt for apartments.

Two days later... Guan Yu and Niu Le became her shopping lackeys, hauling household goods—bedding, furniture, dishes—as if embracing a new life.

Near campus, they chose a two-story commercial space totaling over 400 square meters. Though pricey, Guan Yu didn’t blink. These costs were trivial compared to his impending stone gambling windfall.

Satisfied with their new home, Du Xiaojuan posed like a landlady. “Well? Feels homey, right? Our little nest!”

“Our nest?” Guan Yu raised an eyebrow. Was this a game of house to her?

“Yes! Our shared nest. Come, see our room!” She tugged him upstairs.

“Wait... our room?” Guan Yu gaped.

Holy hell... This silly girl planned for them to share a room in their two-story rental? After days of hotel bed-sharing nearly broke him—holding her fragrant, doll-like form each night, any man would struggle!

He’d resorted to sleeping head-to-toe, avoiding her chest but tormented by her jade-like feet. Repeatedly resisting impulse, her innocent smile always stayed his hand.

He couldn’t hurt her. Until they officially became lovers, he wouldn’t risk her future regrets—especially with Liu Shilei already complicating his life.

Now this arrangement threatened eternal temptation. How long could any man endure?

“What’s wrong?”

“How many beds in the room?” Guan Yu blinked, recalling her purchases: a huge double bed, silk comforter... even mandarin duck pillows!

God help me... He facepalmed.

“What’s the matter?” She puffed her cheeks, eyeing him worriedly.

“Nothing... Senior, aren’t you afraid I’ll... lose control someday?” He peered at her meaningfully.

Chapter 185: Sworn Brothers

Du Xiaojuan bit her lip, glaring. “Afraid? Would I let you hold me every night if I were?”

Guan Yu’s heart skipped. Dangerous territory. Stay calm—she’s just naive. Probably doesn’t even understand what men and women do.

But cohabitation loomed—same bed, shared pillows. A dream scenario for others, his personal purgatory.

Du Xiaojuan’s cozy decor received Guan Yu’s nods during the tour.

“Niu Le, how’s your room?” She asked proudly.

“Uh... great, thanks Senior!” Niu Le shot Guan Yu a pained grin.

Inspecting Niu Le’s pink-themed room—rose bedding, cartoon-themed clock—Guan Yu shuddered. A hulk like Niu Le in this girly den? Bizarre.

Thankfully, their room avoided such extremes. A feminine touch, but tolerable.

At their housewarming, Luo Cheng’s crew arrived. Youthful laughter filled the first-floor hall as takeout feasted.

Luo Cheng updated on upcoming venue openings, though Guan Yu showed little interest. All properties were registered under Guan Yu’s name—the gang’s gesture to avoid profiting unfairly.

Post-dinner, Guan Yu pulled Luo Cheng aside. “Your old crew’s yours, but future recruits need vetting. Character matters.”

“Understood. But with our recent moves, smaller gangs want in. Your thoughts?” Luo Cheng asked respectfully.

“Your call. Stay away from shady deals and bullying civilians. Expand based on earnings—your domain now.”

“But income distribution—”

“Handle it,” Guan Yu cut in. “I’m hands-off. Trust matters.”

He soothed Luo Cheng’s worries—loyalty over money. Millions meant little if his detection skill paid off.

Pulling Luo Cheng close, Guan Yu vowed: “We’re brothers. Our crew will rise—respected by all who once scorned us. But only take those who’ll stand with us through life and death.”

“I understand, Brother Yu.” Luo Cheng’s eyes glistened as he nodded solemnly.
