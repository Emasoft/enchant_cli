“Oh my god, that hurt! The big bad guy almost killed me!” Zhang Han screamed, hastily casting a shield spell on herself and gulping down health potions to survive.

The harrowing scene repeated three times. Gradually, the colossal spider at the center neared its demise. All players seemed drenched in sweat, their eyes glued to the screen as victory loomed.

Suddenly, the screen erupted in a kaleidoscope of light. Lu Mei watched as the spider’s death unleashed a treasure trove. Her gaze locked onto a glowing orange item at the center—the Elven Robe (Female).

“Ah! Level 80 gear! Hahaha! A legendary robe perfect for me!” Zhang Han’s mouth fell open in glee.

But her joy shattered when the robe, after a dice roll, went to a male teammate. “No fair! Why did he get it? I want it!” She spammed crying emojis, whining, “Give me the robe! Give it to me!”

A teammate chimed in, “Dawu, give the robe to Mengmeng.” The loot holder retorted, “No way! This is orange-tier legendary gear with top-tier stats. It’s worth a fortune!”

“You money-grubbing jerk! Mengmeng’s a girl in real life. How can you bully her?” another teammate snapped.

Pouting, Zhang Han pleaded, “Big brother, please give it to me! I’ll look so pretty in this Elven Robe. I’ll trade anything!” Her voice dripped with desperation.

“No. It’s mine,” Dawu stated coldly.

“You’re the worst! Ugh, I hate you!” Zhang Han’s avatar crumpled into a sobbing mess.

“Dawu, name your price. I’ll buy it for Mengmeng,” offered another teammate.

Zhang Han perked up, awaiting Dawu’s reply.

After a minute, Dawu typed, “No market price yet. It’s the server’s first epic-grade item. 5,000 RMB isn’t unreasonable.”

“Screw you! Why not rob a bank? If PvP were allowed here, I’d slaughter you!” a teammate roared.

Another added, “Dawu, is 5,000 RMB worth alienating Mengmeng?”

**Chapter 2052: All Types Exist**

Zhang Han had no patience. Money meant nothing to her—5,000 RMB was pocket change. But she craved that robe. “It’s just 5,000! You’re all so stingy! Can’t you let a girl have what she wants—”

Before she finished, the furious teammate cut in: “Send me your bank details. I’ll buy it and gift it to Mengmeng!”

The three women behind Zhang Han gasped. Someone actually splurged 5,000 RMB to simp for her? Was this guy insane?

After tense negotiations, Dawu traded the Elven Robe to Super Little Mengmeng. Zhang Han exploded with joy, flooding the chat with kissing, hugging, and laughing emojis, overwhelming the generous teammate.

Her friends cheered as she donned the robe. Her avatar transformed from crimson battle gear into an ethereal silver-gowned fairy, glowing with celestial radiance.

“Wow, Hanhan! You’re stunning!” A’mei gushed behind her.

Only then did Zhang Han notice Lu Mei. “Meimei! When did you arrive?”

Lu Mei flushed. “Oh, just now!”

“Quick, log in! We’re raiding dungeons today!” Zhang Han urged A’mei and Xue Jing, who scrambled to join her.

**#**

In the game’s capital, Zhang Han’s Elven Robe drew swarms of friend requests. She founded a guild: *Beauty Clan*.

“We’ll lure rich, handsome simps to protect us. Hehe…”

“Hanhan! The game has voice and video chat!” A’mei discovered.

“Perfect! Now we’re unstoppable!” Zhang Han crowed.

Soon, Lu Mei joined the fray. Their avatars—Super Little Mengmeng, Super Little Meimei, Super Little Jingjing, and Super Little Meimei—led the server’s largest guild, hailed as the *Four Beauties*.

**Feng Residence**
Feng Xihu woke at 4 PM, groggy and headache-ridden. At dinner, her brother remarked, “Sleeping all day? Up to no good last night?”

“I don’t know why I’m so exhausted,” she muttered, massaging her temples.

“See a doctor,” he said, devouring oysters—his staple for “vigor.” Feng Xihu knew his scandalous habits but ignored them.

As she ate, last night’s dream haunted her. “Brother… I dreamed a man broke into my room.”

Feng少爷 smirked. “Turning 19 and craving men? Want me to fetch you some? What type—daddies, twinks, hunks?”

She rolled her eyes. “It’s not like that!”

“Then what?” He grinned.

“Forget it!” But her mind replayed the dream—the stranger’s face vivid, his hands under her nightgown. Blushing, she sketched him.

Feng少爷 froze at the drawing. “Guan Yu!” he spat.

“Guan Yu? The family enemy?”

“The bastard who crippled me!” He shredded the sketch. “Never mention him again!”

Feng Xihu recalled Guan Yu was their nemesis but shrugged. “Why would I dream of him?”

“Was it even a dream?” Feng少爺 paled. “Did he sneak in?”

Her cheeks burned as memories flooded back—the bathroom, his touch. “Pervert…” she mumbled, fleeing.

Feng少爺 alerted their father. “Guan Yu invaded our home! He might’ve… defiled Xihu!”

“Double the guards! Secure the South Wing!” Feng家主 ordered.

Feng少爺 realized Guan Yu’s true target: the family’s secret relic, *Ten Thousand Year Demonic Realm*.

**#**

Meanwhile, Feng Xihu, flushed and restless, resolved to find Guan Yu—family feud be damned.

**Evening**
After the rain ceased, Guan Yu fetched Qing Ling’er to treat Jin Hua, then headed to buy computers for Xue Jing’s group.

“Four desktops now—Lu Mei’s joining,” Xue Jing said before hanging up.

At the mall, he sought help from his frosty-yet-alluring ally, Qiong Si.

“Long time no see,” she said, thawing into a smile reserved only for him.

“I need info—ever heard of Feng’s *Ten Thousand Year Demonic Realm*?”

She shook her head. “Sounds ominous. What is it?”
