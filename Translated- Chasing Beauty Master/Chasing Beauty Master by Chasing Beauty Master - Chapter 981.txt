However, with the starting bid now announced, the crowd gathered here for this treasure map knew the final price would skyrocket. Even if buyers later regretted their purchase, they couldn't blame the Yang Family.

**Chapter 2508: Auction (Part 2)**

"One million..."

The bidding began with a white-robed middle-aged man in the corner directly shouting a high price. This move had been anticipated by everyone, so it caused little surprise.

"Five million..."

"Five and a half million..."

The crowd scrambled to raise bids, pushing the price to nearly six million within minutes—and still climbing. Guanyu watched the spectacle with amusement, convinced these people were beyond redemption.

Even if the treasure map were genuine, who could guarantee the value of the hoard? A single fragment already commanded such sums. How much would assembling all twelve pieces cost? The final treasure might pale in comparison to the expense of acquiring the map. By then, regret would be futile.

Moreover, this was a counterfeit. The coordinates Guanyu had plotted on these fabricated maps led directly to the Feng Family's estate. Divided into twelve fragments, selling each at these prices meant he could abandon all other work and retire as a tycoon simply by forging maps. Let the fools chase their illusions.

Within minutes, bids approached ten million before stabilizing—a miracle considering the repeated warnings about the map's dubious authenticity. Without those cautions, the frenzy would have soared higher.

Qu Guandao's latest bid of 9.5 million left him looking relaxed. Securing the map at this price would be a steal. His mind raced with possibilities. Despite years in the jianghu, Qu had amassed little wealth. Only recent backing from a powerful patron enabled his participation.

His cheerful demeanor stemmed from the unexpectedly low bids. He chatted casually with Aunt Yingshan beside him, careful not to provoke her. Though superior in combat, Qu feared her venomous insects and traps—lessons learned through painful experience.

"Fifteen million!"

A monk seated upfront raised his placard. Qu shot a venomous glare while Guanyu observed the shaven-headed bidder, no older than forty. Monks frequenting auctions for treasure maps? The once-ascetic title now reeked of worldly greed.

As bidding resumed, Guanyu noticed Western attendees, their translator whispering urgently. Xuejing murmured, "Winning this map won't be easy. I expect prices to double."

Guanyu nodded. Several silent observers—whom he'd mistaken for disinterested—were clearly waiting to strike at the final moment.

Twenty million. Thirty million. The increments slowed, the latest bidder a stranger huddled in discussion. Nearby Daoist elders shook their heads, priced out of contention.

Guanyu recognized the lurking danger: many "bidders" were mere spectators—martial artists and ruffians awaiting the winner to ambush.

Qu Guandao gritted his teeth, raising his placard again. "Twenty-five million!" He hoped this would end it. The sum stretched his resources to the limit—he might as well sell blood.

"Twenty-five million!"

The same bidder countered, nearly choking Qu with rage. Were this elsewhere, violence would have erupted. But in the Yang Family's auction hall? Even Qu dared not cause a scene.

Aunt Yingshan remained silent, plotting theft post-auction. Combat wasn't her forte, but poisons and stealth? Child's play.

"Thirty million." Another bidder—unfamiliar, likely representing wealthy clans—joined the fray. These magnates could outspend any jianghu faction, bidding tens of millions without blinking.

Guanyu observed three remaining groups: one from City A by their accent, others unidentified. The treasure's rumored location in City A had stirred local elites, though foreign bidders—previously active—now withdrew, perhaps skeptical.

**Chapter 2509: Auction (Conclusion)**

Guanyu suddenly recalled something and dialed Yao Yu, Lü Mei's mother.

"Aunt Yao, are you bidding for the map at Yang's auction? Withdraw immediately!"

Yao Yu chuckled. "Planning to claim it yourself, son-in-law? We could collaborate..."

Guanyu lowered his voice. "I haven't bid once. You're clever—understand?"

Realization dawned. "You don't want me pursuing this."

"Correct."

After Yao Yu recalled her agents, only two bidders remained—likely the Feng Family and an unknown party. Guanyu smirked. Let the Fengs waste millions on a map leading to their own estate! When they pieced together all twelve fragments...

"Forty-five million!"

The final bid silenced the hall. The auctioneer's gavel fell. As winners hurried out, trailed by opportunistic martial artists, Xuejing linked arms with Guanyu. Aunt Yingshan had vanished—already stalking her prey.

Guanyu inquired about the winners through the Yangs' steward Xu, who demurred: "Young Master Guan, visit the Patriarch."

At the Yang Estate, Patriarch Yang played chess with his granddaughter Yang Conghan.

"Enjoying your profits, Old Yang?" Guanyu teased.

The Patriarch snorted. "You sketch on pigskin and reap millions. I bear the risks!"

Yang Conghan interjected, "Grandfather, give Guanyu a larger share!"

"See how she favors him?" The Patriarch feigned heartbreak. "My own flesh betraying me!"

Guanyu laughed. "Three-tenths suffices. Without your auction house, my forgeries were worthless."

**Chapter 2510: Bargain**

The 45 million sale, minus fees, left 40 million. Guanyu's 30% share—12 million—seemed fair. Easy wealth, indeed.

As they bantered, Guanyu marveled at his luck. Twelve forged fragments, each auctioned thus? He'd rival kings. But better to let the Fengs unravel their purchased paradox—a treasure map pointing home. Let martial artists hound them while Bill Clan's enforcers stood guard.

The game was just beginning.
