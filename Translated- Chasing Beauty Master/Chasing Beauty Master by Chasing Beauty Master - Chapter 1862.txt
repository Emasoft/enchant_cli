“Chapter 4894: Illogical”

“Master speaks wisely,” Steward Ma said, bowing his head. “This old horse acted foolishly in agreeing to Madam’s approach. The fault lies entirely with me.”

Master Qin waved a hand. “Do not blame yourself. Madam’s maternal instincts for Qu Hua clouded her judgment. Such short-sightedness should never have been heeded.”

Steward Ma nodded, relieved the reprimand had passed. “Master, I request funds to compensate the wounded guards. Though the mistake was mine, the men deserve solace for their injuries.”

“A reasonable demand,” Master Qin acknowledged. “Your recklessness warrants punishment. I shall deduct two months’ wages to comfort the guards. Consider this matter settled.”

Both men knew this “punishment” was mere formality. After decades of service, Steward Ma cared little for meager monthly silver—Master Qin’s occasional lavish rewards far outweighed such trifles.

“As you command.” Steward Ma turned to leave but halted at his master’s call.

“Wait. I have another task.” Master Qin’s voice turned grave. “Investigate the fishing village affair thoroughly. Something feels amiss. Afterwards, summon Qin Huan to me.”

“I shall depart at once.”

Though pained by the loss of loyal retainers—hardened experts cultivated over years—Master Qin swallowed his grievances. Practicality prevailed: the Qin household still relied heavily on Steward Ma’s competence.

**Nightfall – Qin Huan’s Chambers**

Summoned despite the late hour, Qin Huan entered his father’s study. “Father, what urgent matter requires your son’s presence?”

Master Qin tapped a ledger. “Explain these discrepancies. Have you neglected reviewing the accounts?”

“Recent affairs consumed my attention. Subordinates handled the ledgers before submitting them to you.” Qin Huan approached, scanning the pages. His brow furrowed. “Why has the fishery yield halved these past two months? This defies reason!”

“Compare it to last year’s records,” Master Qin said coldly. “Summer catches were leaner, yet yields remained higher despite fewer vessels. These numbers reek of falsification.”

Qin Huan paled. “Since taking charge last winter, I entrusted Qu Hua with managing the village. I…didn’t scrutinize the details.”

“Fool!” Master Qin slammed the desk. “Our family’s vital enterprise handed to an outsider! Harboring that Qu brat here already strains courtesy. How dare you delegate core operations to him?”

“Mother dotes on her nephew,” Qin Huan protested weakly. “Qu Hua never competed for influence. I thought assigning him duties would prove useful. Never imagined such incompetence…”

“He bears the Qu name!” Master Qin’s voice crackled with fury. “Overburdened? You should have consulted me! Entrusting strategic assets to outsiders—this is beyond negligence!”

The rebuke stung, yet Qin Huan recognized his father’s concealed intent: beneath the anger lay investigative caution. Errors existed, but their origins remained unclear.

“Let me rectify this,” Qin Huan pleaded. “I’ll uncover the truth behind these discrepancies.”

“Do so discreetly,” Master Qin warned. “If Qu Hua’s guilt emerges, inform me before your mother learns.”

**Days Later – Capital Gossip**

Rumors swirled about the Qin family’s humiliation. Tales of Wan Hong single-handedly defeating Qin guards electrified teahouses. Citizens anticipated violent retaliation, yet days passed without Qin reprisals. The mysterious Wan Hong flourished while the Qins nursed their pride—an uncharacteristic submission.

**Fishing Village Investigation**

Qin Huan arrived incognito, probing summer’s poor yields. Fishermen blamed unusual heatwaves reducing hauls. Yet discrepancies multiplied: ledgers listed fifty vessels, but villagers reported barely forty operational.

Confronting the village chief, Qin Huan brandished the ledger. “Explain these inflated numbers.”

“Young Master, our shipments never waver!” The chief trembled. “Every crate sent to the capital leaves intact. What happens en route isn’t our doing!”

Qin Huan’s suspicion shifted. If departures were accurate but arrivals diminished, the merchant convoys must be pilfering goods.

**Shadowing the Convoy**

Disguised among laborers, Qin Huan trailed a shipment. The convoy detoured before reaching Qin warehouses, unloading crates at an unmarked compound.

“Follow that cart!” he ordered retainers.

Tracking the diverted goods led to a shocking revelation: the Qin’s own transporters orchestrated the thefts. For months, they’d siphoned resources, exploiting accounting loopholes.

**Confrontation**

Returning home, Qin Huan confronted his father and Steward Ma. “The corruption runs deeper than Qu Hua. Our merchant teams are complicit.”

Master Qin’s eyes narrowed. “Certainty?”

“I witnessed the diversions myself. They’ve likely bribed officials to conceal the fraud.”

Steward Ma interjected, “Shall we involve the magistrates?”

“Not yet.” Master Qin stroked his beard. “We’ll dismantle this scheme from within. Qin Huan—assemble loyal men. Let the thieves grow bold before we strike.”

As night deepened, the Qin household simmered with silent calculations. Shadows stretched across ledgers and loyalty, where silver threads of greed threatened to unravel a dynasty’s fabric.
