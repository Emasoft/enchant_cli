Guan Yu quickly scanned the contents, finding everything largely consistent with Locke's claims, with an additional 200,000 gold coins—more than enough to lay the foundation for his future integration into human society.

Suddenly recalling the need for Amy's antidote, he rummaged through the items but found nothing. Raising his head, he demanded, “Where did you hide the antidote, you little bastard?”

Locke burst into laughter upon hearing this. “So you finally need something from me! But since you’re determined to kill me, what difference does it make whether I give you the antidote?”

Guan Yu recognized Locke’s attempt to use the antidote as leverage. Smirking, he countered, “Keep your silence then. Once you’re dead, I’ll search every inch of your corpse for it. Bickamau—no more mercy!”

At his command, Bickamau leaped forward with a flash, tail crackling with lightning. The sight terrified Locke, who had already suffered from the cat’s electric strikes. If not for Bickamau’s intervention earlier, the duel’s outcome might have been different.

“Stop! I’ll talk!” Locke wheezed, pulling a red vial from his waist. “Three pills inside—one dose neutralizes the poison!”

Before Locke finished, Bickamau snatched the vial and sniffed it cautiously. Guan Yu eyed Locke coldly. “How do I know this isn’t a trick?”

“Good heavens! Why would I lie when my life’s at stake? If you doubt me, I’ll take one myself!”

Guan Yu promptly retrieved a pill and lowered Locke to the ground. “Do it then.” He forced the pill into Locke’s mouth.

As Locke swallowed, Guan Yu observed him closely. Though no physical changes occurred, the shift in Locke’s shifty gaze betrayed his deceit. Suddenly, a surge of dark energy erupted from Locke, forcing Guan Yu to stagger back.

“Bickamau! Watch out—he’s transformed!” Guan Yu shouted.

The cat positioned itself opposite Guan Yu, flanking the demonized Locke, whose eyes now glowed crimson and skin turned obsidian. “Ha! You think yourself clever?” Locke sneered. “This pill truly cures, but it also amplifies power! Now in my demonized state, let’s see you defeat me!”

Guan Yu feigned calm. “Two days ago, I slew Wei Buqun after his demonization. His strength rivaled yours. Was that luck too?”

Locke faltered, then spat, “He was a fool! I won’t make his mistakes!”

“Luck?” Guan Yu taunted. “I’ve mastered countering demonized foes. Strike now, and I’ll end you within a minute!”

The threat worked. Locke hesitated, recalling Guan Yu’s prior victory. “Fine! You’ll regret this!” He hurled a barrage of poisoned needles before fleeing.

“Damn! The clan leader wanted him alive,” Guan Yu muttered as an elven warrior approached.

“Lord Guan Yu, why let him escape?”

“Even wounded, a demonized Magister is beyond your strength. Take the antidote to Amy—one pill suffices.”

“Will you return with us?”

“I’ll track him. His demonization lasts only an hour. Once it fades, I’ll strike.”

“Need assistance?”

“No. More people would only hinder me. Inform the clan leader not to send aid.”

After the elves departed, Bickamau asked, “Boss, are we truly chasing that runt?”

“No. He won’t return soon. I sensed something ahead—treasure.”

The cat perked up. “Treasure? Your instincts sharpen! Lead on!”

They soon reached a vast swamp fringed with bones. “A swamp in a forest?” Bickamau mused. “Treasure here must be extraordinary—and fiercely guarded.”

“Guardians? Why sense none?”

“Because you’re still weak,” Bickamau bluntly replied.

Guan Yu grimaced but pressed on. After scouting, they discovered a crimson orb—a Crimson Demon Fruit—and a Body-Forging Serpent Flower. “This flower enhances physical cultivation!” Bickamau exclaimed.

As Guanyu harvested it, a cadaverous voice hissed, “Leave. This place isn’t for you.” A skeletal elder materialized, his gaze plunging Guan Yu into void-like darkness.

“Forgive my intrusion,” Guan Yu stammered, retreating as Bickamau bolted in terror.

Once clear, the cat panted, “That elder…a peak Sword Emperor at least!”

“A Sword Emperor? The treasure’s guardian?”

“Likely. He wanted me dead. We barely escaped!”

Guan Yu collapsed, exhausted. “Why flee so wildly?”

“Because that man…he’s unimaginably powerful!”
