“Guan Yu, a mere junior disciple, dares show such insolence towards me! Today, I shall properly discipline you! Let me teach you what it means to respect your elders!” Elder Xiang stood there, manifesting his magical artifact. Without another word, he channeled spiritual energy and began silently reciting incantations.

Elder Xiang could no longer restrain himself. Today, he absolutely must teach Guan Yu a lesson. Seeing A’Cai grievously injured and unable to participate in tomorrow’s competition had already weighed heavily on his heart. Yet Guan Yu repeatedly crossed his bottom line. When patience is exhausted, restraint becomes unnecessary.

All disciples wore expressions of shock upon witnessing Elder Xiang’s actions. None expected the elder to attack so abruptly. If Guan Yu were truly crippled, none could predict how this situation would resolve.

Elder Xiang’s mastery of spells was no trivial matter. Ordinarily, disciples rarely saw him take action.

In his hands, Elder Xiang now held a magical artifact resembling an iron rod—though shaped more like a ruler, its extraordinary nature was evident.

Azure spiritual energy surged around Elder Xiang’s body, forming a cerulean barrier that encased him like a protective shield.

**Chapter 3258: Impulse (Part 1)**

This shield-like formation possessed no actual defensive capabilities, serving merely as an ostentatious display. As Elder Xiang’s spiritual energy intensified, its domineering aura became increasingly palpable.

Most disciples instinctively retreated, fearing collateral damage from the elder’s impending strike.

The most delighted observer was Ling Su. He cheered inwardly—if Guan Yu endured this attack, half his life would surely be forfeited. Ling Su doubted Guan Yu possessed any meaningful defensive measures.

Guan Yu remained calm, his face betraying no concern. Xiao Zhi and A’Ze grew anxious. None anticipated Elder Xiang actually attacking a disciple. How could Guan Yu possibly withstand an elder’s formidable cultivation?

Though worried, Xiao Zhi and A’Ze could devise no countermeasures. With Elder Xiang’s spell already nocked like an arrow on the bowstring, Siqi became most distraught. She never imagined the elder would act so impulsively against a disciple.

Siqi intended to shield Guan Yu, using her abilities to mitigate the spell’s impact. Though aware her limited power offered scant protection, she saw no alternative.

Stepping forward, Siqi positioned herself before Guan Yu. Producing a Jade Ruyi, she activated a golden defensive formation that enveloped them both.

The golden barrier resembled a steamed bun’s shape, encasing the pair within.

Elder Xiang’s spell was no ordinary technique. Determined to leave Guan Yu no chance of retaliation—since A’Cai’s injuries prevented tomorrow’s participation—the elder resolved to repay cruelty in kind. Even if the sect master later rebuked him, it would be worth avenging his disciple.

But Elder Xiang never anticipated Siqi’s intervention. His eyes widened at her artifact. “Jade Ruyi?” he exclaimed.

With decades of cultivation, Elder Xiang recognized this treasure. He’d last seen it years ago in Elder Lu’s possession. How it came to Siqi—a disciple of Convergence Peak—remained a mystery. After their previous dispute at Tiger’s Head Peak Hall, where neither he nor Elder Dai gained advantage, this meddlesome girl now presented herself for punishment alongside Guan Yu.

The luminous artifact in Siqi’s hands clearly surpassed ordinary implements. Xiao Zhi clutched A’Ze’s sleeve, exclaiming, “See that exquisite artifact? Guan Yu gifted her that Jade Ruyi! Such beauty—undoubtedly a high-grade treasure!”

Indeed, the Jade Ruyi’s craftsmanship and appearance marked it as superior. Its elegance complemented Siqi’s peerless beauty, rendering her appearance positively celestial.

Nearby eavesdropping disciples noted this revelation about the artifact’s origin.

Ling Su gnashed his teeth, edging away while cursing inwardly: “That bastard Guan Yu gave her such a treasure! No wonder she defends him. Damn it—the finest cabbage ruined by a swine!”

Elder Xiang snorted derisively. Though the Jade Ruyi impressed, Siqi’s cultivation remained inadequate. Even enhanced by the artifact’s power, her defenses meant little against his might.

Resolved, the elder decided to punish both offenders. Let the sect master rebuke him afterward—at least these two would miss the Six Peaks Assembly, greatly improving Wen Ming’s chances.

Touched by Siqi’s concern, Guan Yu observed her straining to maintain the protective barrier. Yet he recognized its insufficiency against Elder Xiang’s assault. Not only did the elder refuse to relent upon seeing the shield—he accelerated his incantations, augmenting his spell.

Coldly addressing the elder, Guan Yu warned: “Elder Xiang, if you insist on attacking, don’t blame me for discarding courtesy!”

This served as final warning. Alone, Guan Yu might evade or mitigate the spell’s damage through speed. But with Siqi shielding him, both would suffer.

Trapped maintaining her barrier, Siqi couldn’t move. Guan Yu realized even attempting to charge Elder Xiang now would prove futile—the spell would release before he closed the distance. Though Siqi’s assistance backfired, he appreciated her intent.

Left no choice, Guan Yu summoned the Emperor’s Seal to protect them both. Infusing it with spiritual awareness, he communicated with its artifact spirit, preparing a defensive spell.

Elder Xiang’s technique reached critical mass. “Release!” he roared. The azure energy surrounding him coalesced into countless spiritual swords midair, all aimed at Guan Yu.

Withholding nothing, Guan Yu waved his hand. Golden radiance erupted from his body, illuminating the night like human-shaped sunlight. Onlookers winced at the glare.

To Guan Yu’s chagrin, Ancestor Jiu’s high-grade defensive spell proved single-target. Had he known earlier, he’d have cast it on Siqi. Now, he could only position himself before her.

Through the golden haze, Siqi vaguely discerned Guan Yu’s protective stance.

The spiritual swords descended like a deadly rain.

**Chapter 3260: Impulse (Part 2)**

As Elder Xiang began chanting a second spell, Guan Yu lunged forward. Though capable of unleashing the Emperor’s Seal’s stored magic, he hesitated—each stored spell represented significant effort from Ancestor Jiu, to be used only in direst need.

Clutching a dagger in his right hand and the Emperor’s Seal in his left, Guan Yu closed the distance at top speed. His plan: close-quarters combat to prevent spellcasting. Without protective entourage, Elder Xiang would struggle in melee.

Guan Yu kept the Seal ready, wary of sudden attacks. The fifty-meter gap posed challenges—in his prime, he’d have crossed it instantly. Now, limited by depleted energy, his speed, while impressive to others, felt sluggish.

Leftspire Peak disciples repeatedly obstructed his path, buying time for their elder. Knowing Guan Yu’s approach, Elder Xiang dared not prepare complex spells.

The elder’s original plan—forcing Guan Yu to expend the Seal’s limited spells—shifted upon realizing his opponent practiced both martial and mystical arts. This dual cultivation marked Guan Yu as exceptionally rare and dangerous. Historical precedent warned that such individuals became peerless experts—making today’s enmity potentially catastrophic.

Elder Xiang faced two choices: swallow pride and reconcile, or cripple Guan Yu permanently. Opting for the latter, he resolved to bear any punishment rather than risk future retribution.

As Guan Yu pressed through the disciple blockade, Elder Xiang raised his iron ruler skyward, channeling its full power into a high-grade spell. The disciple human shields proved unexpectedly useful—without them, Guan Yu would have already closed in.
