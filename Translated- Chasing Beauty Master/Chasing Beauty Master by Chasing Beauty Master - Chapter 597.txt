“Since the vendor has said so, I’ll stop being coy. I’ll offer two hundred and seventy gold coins. My initial price was two hundred and forty, but since you’ve shown such sincerity, I’m not one to be stingy. Consider the extra thirty coins as compensation for your brothers’ hard work. How does that sound?”

Upon hearing Guan Yu’s words, the vendor was delighted. He had expected Guan Yu to drive a hard bargain, offering at most two hundred coins. Never had he imagined such generosity. Typically, an expert would never quote so high, but Guan Yu’s elevated offer clearly demonstrated his earnestness.

Without hesitation, the vendor replied, “Young brother, your generosity is admirable! Since you’re so sincere, I’ll spare further pleasantries. I am Mo Lifei, a free hunter. If you ever need anything, tell me, and I’ll sell it to you at a fair price—no deceit like this time.”

Hearing the vendor introduce himself as Mo Lifei with equal sincerity, Guan Yu responded, “Brother Mo Lifei, I am Guan Yu. I hope for your guidance in the future. If I have needs, I’ll surely seek you out again!”

Mo Lifei, pleased by Guan Yu’s courtesy, asked if he wished to purchase anything else. Guan Yu, no longer concealing his interest, picked up a tattered sheepskin parchment from the ground. “Brother Mo Lifei, do you know what this is? It looks so worn, as if it’d crumble at a touch.”

Noticing Guan Yu’s curiosity, Mo Lifei explained, “My companions and I found this near a swamp while hunting Wood Wolves. At first, we thought it part of a map, but it proved otherwise. It’s impervious to fire and water, and even I, a Martial Master, couldn’t tear it. We studied it extensively but found nothing. So, we decided to sell it here.”

Guan Yu was stunned. Mo Lifei was a Martial Master? And this ragged parchment, resistant to elements and even a Martial Master’s strength, must indeed be a treasure as Elder Zhan claimed. Hiding his awe, Guan Yu smiled. “Aren’t you afraid someone else might uncover its secrets after buying it?”

Mo Lifei laughed. “If others discover its value, it simply means fate denied us. We free hunters don’t cling to greed like mercenaries. We live simply, without lofty ambitions. Are you interested?”

“Your philosophy is admirable, Brother Mo Lifei,” Guan Yu admitted. “Truthfully, I am curious. What’s your price?”

Though puzzled, Mo Lifei saw no harm in obliging. “Since Brother Guan Yu desires it, I won’t refuse. But this parchment belongs to my team, so the price isn’t mine alone. I hope you won’t think I’m inflating it.”

“I trust your integrity. Name the price.”

“Three thousand gold coins.”

Guan Yu’s heart sank. He’d spent all his coins on Heavenly Spirit Grass and Demonic Spirit Herbs. He had nothing left—let alone three thousand!

As he hesitated, Elder Zhan’s voice whispered, “Boy, your father just gave you three thousand coins. Use them! I guarantee this parchment won’t disappoint. Skip it, and you’ll regret it.”

After a brief internal struggle, Guan Yu pulled out the money pouch and tossed it to Mo Lifei. “Three thousand coins. Count them if you wish.”

“No need. I trust you.” Mo Lifei handed over the parchment. The moment Guan Yu touched it, a faint chill seeped into his palm. Startled, he quickly tucked it away. “Thank you, Brother Mo Lifei!”

“No need for thanks. It was meant to be sold anyway. Better you than a stranger.”

Guan Yu smiled, pleased. By raising his earlier offer, he’d not only secured the parchment but also befriended a Martial Master. A double victory!

Elder Zhan chuckled in his mind. “Clever lad! I admire shrewdness. But beware—this Mo Lifei is cunning. A Martial Master could easily handle second-tier Wood Wolves. Your father, a fellow Martial Master, subdued a second-tier Thunder Devourer. Your move was wise.”

After storing the parchment, Guan Yu clasped his hands. “Thank you again, Brother Mo Lifei. I must attend to other matters. Farewell!”

As Guan Yu turned to leave, Mo Lifei called out, “Wait! May I ask… is your father Guan Xiao?”

Guan Yu froze. “How do you know that? Don’t tell me he saved your life!”

Mo Lifei’s face lit with excitement. He gripped Guan Yu’s arm. “You’re truly Guan Xiao’s son?!”

Guan Yu winced but didn’t cry out. His arm, tempered by Elder Zhan’s training, withstood the force. Mo Lifei quickly released him, apologizing. “Forgive my roughness! Are you hurt?”

“It’s nothing,” Guan Yu assured, though red marks lingered.

Mo Lifei marveled. A Qi Refinement Stage Two cultivator should have shattered under such pressure. “May I see your right arm?”

Puzzled, Guan Yu obliged. Mo Lifei pushed up his sleeve, revealing two pristine silver streaks. “Pure silver veins! I’ve never seen such purity. Truly, a tiger father sires no dog of a son!”

Guan Yu chuckled modestly.

“Is Elder Guan Xiao home? I haven’t seen him in two years. I’ve longed to thank him. Could you take me to him?”

Before Guan Yu could answer, a cold laugh interrupted. “So the mighty Guan Yu cowers behind women? What a hero!”

Wu Yuying, her brother’s defeat fresh in her mind, glared daggers. Guan Yu bristled but hesitated. After battling Hu Xiaohai, a Great Mage like Wu Yuying would overwhelm him.

A lilting voice cut through the tension. “Sister Yuying, Brother Guan Yu needs rest. If you crave a fight, I’ll oblige!”

Huolingling, the purple-clad genius of Hundun Sect, leapt onto the stage. Though her intervention irked Guan Yu, she ignored him, addressing Wu Yuying. “Vent your anger on me instead.”

Wu Yuying’s face darkened. “Guan Yu! Hiding behind a girl? How pathetic!”

“You’re courting death!” Guan Yu stepped forward, fists clenched, but Elder Griffin’s roar halted him.

“Enough! Have you forgotten your place? Any private vendettas will face my wrath!”

The trio fell silent. Huolingling knew their rivalry was irreparable, but her loyalty to Guan Yu remained unshaken.

Elder Griffin glared. “Today’s matches are over. Disperse!”
