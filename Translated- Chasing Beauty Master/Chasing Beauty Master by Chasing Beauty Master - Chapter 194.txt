He had been dormant for too long; it was time for a proper outburst.

At the same time, he witnessed the terrifying stamina of women shopping. Nearly every major mall and boutique became a battlefield for Liu Shilei and Mo Ling, while Guan Yu’s role was reduced to trying on clothes and carrying bags.

In less than two hours, Guan Yu’s hands were crammed with packages—some for all three of them, but most were items Liu Shilei had bought for him.

“Shilei-jie, didn’t you always want a necklace? We’re finally out—let’s go in,” Mo Ling suggested, tugging Liu Shilei’s arm as they passed a jewelry store.

Liu Shilei glanced up at the opulently decorated shop, her eyes flickering with longing but hesitation. She shook her head. “No. The things here aren’t something my monthly salary can afford. Let’s look for clothes that suit Guan Yu instead.”

Ah, this was the essence of a devoted homemaker—reluctant to spend on herself, yet eager to shower Guan Yu with gifts.

Though fleeting, Guan Yu caught the faint glimmer of desire in Liu Shilei’s eyes. He smiled. “Jie, I’ve never bought you a gift before. Let’s go in. If something fits, we’ll get it.”

**Chapter 480: Mocked**

“*You* buying it?” Liu Shilei paused. “You’re still a student. Even if you have money, you should save it.”

She chided him with a look, but sweetness swelled in her heart. She might not need the necklace, but she cherished his thoughtfulness.

Mo Ling pursed her lips, dragging Liu Shilei into the store. “Shilei-jie, you’re underestimating this philandering playboy. He didn’t blink spending eighty million on a ring—why would he care about petty cash? Let’s pick everything that suits you and make him bleed dry!”

“Eighty million for a ring?” Liu Shilei gasped, covering her mouth.

Guan Yu awkwardly chuckled, shooting Mo Ling a glare. “Jie, it wasn’t like that. I was just messing with someone.”

Liu Shilei gave him a skeptical glance but stayed silent.

Mo Ling wrinkled her nose and yanked Liu Shilei inside.

Guan Yu sniffed, thinking Mo Ling wasn’t so bad aside from her loose tongue. Though her goal was to drain his wallet, he didn’t mind. With millions in his account, over three hundred million pending from Li Yuanshan, and Luo Cheng’s thriving entertainment venues generating ample monthly income, he could afford it.

Mo Ling’s antics aligned perfectly with his intentions. Liu Shilei had silently sacrificed for him; now that she finally desired something, he wouldn’t let her down.

Located on a bustling commercial street at night, the store was packed. Seven salespeople hustled but still couldn’t keep up.

“Shilei-jie, look at this one—it’d complement your fair skin,” Mo Ling said, pointing to a necklace in the display case.

Liu Shilei leaned forward, her gaze drifting to the price tag: 14,000—nearly three months of her salary. “The design’s too flashy. It doesn’t suit me.”

Mo Ling fixated on the necklace, oblivious to Liu Shilei’s reaction, but Guan Yu noticed. “How will you know unless you try it?” he interjected.

“Exactly—try it!” Mo Ling agreed.

“Salesperson, show us this necklace,” Guan Yu said, tapping the glass counter.

The saleswoman assisting another customer glanced sideways at Guan Yu, her smile dimming as she noted the unbranded bags in his hands—Meters/bonwe, Semir, and the like. “Can’t you see I’m busy? Wait your turn.”

Convinced they couldn’t afford the necklace, she dismissed them as window-shoppers wasting her time.

“What’s with your attitude?” Mo Ling snapped.

“What about it? Are they not customers too?” The saleswoman scowled.

“Can’t we just look? We didn’t ask for your help!”

“You think you can demand service? The store’s crowded—who knows if you’ll pocket something!”

Mo Ling, never one for patience, retorted, “How dare you accuse us? What kind of service is this?”

The saleswoman sneered, ignoring them to fawn over a gold-laden tycoon—a walking bonus for her.

Liu Shilei tugged Mo Ling’s arm. “Let’s look elsewhere.”

“No! She’s insulting us. I’m trying this necklace even if it kills me!” Mo Ling crossed her arms, fuming.

Knowing Mo Ling’s temper, Liu Shilei sighed and relented.

Guan Yu frowned, setting down the bags to confront the saleswoman, but Liu Shilei stopped him. “Don’t cause trouble.”

She feared Guan Yu’s impulsiveness might escalate.

“Jie, in N City, no one dares mess with me,” he grinned.

It was true—both underworld and elite respected him now. But Liu Shilei, a simple university teacher, saw only reckless bravado. “I know you’re capable, but you promised not to stir trouble. Remember?”

He’d vowed this after leaving detention. Guan Yu exhaled, suppressing his irritation. “Fine, we’ll wait. But Ling-jie won’t back down.”

Liu Shilei sighed. “Let’s browse meanwhile.”

For fifteen minutes, Mo Ling stood defiantly until the saleswoman finished with the tycoon.

“Now, get the necklace,” Mo Ling demanded.

**Chapter 481: I’ll Take Them All**

The saleswoman glared. “Can’t you see I’m busy?”

“Liar! You just finished. Get it now, or I’ll report you!”

As a well-dressed matron approached, the saleswoman smirked. “I’ll be busy with *her*.”

“I was here first!” Mo Ling shouted.

“Students like you can’t afford this. Try the night market.”

Mo Ling’s face darkened.

“Who’s ‘pretending’?” Guan Yu’s icy voice cut in.

The saleswoman froze under his predatory glare.

“Do your job instead of acting superior. You’re no heiress—just a petty clerk.”

“Who are you to lecture me?” she spat.

“I don’t care what you do—unless you offend me.”

“I quit before serving you!”

“You think you’ll keep this job?” Guan Yu scoffed.

A manager hurried over. “Sir, apologies. Let me assist you.”

Guan Yu ignored his insincere smile. “No need.”

He circled the store, pointing at fifteen items—necklaces, earrings, rings. “I’ll take these, plus the necklace. Total it.”

The manager gaped. After recalculating, he stammered, “That’s… 320,000. Card or cash?”

“Card.” Guan Yu handed over Luo Cheng’s black card.

The manager’s demeanor flipped. “Of course! And here’s a gold membership card—15% off all future purchases.”

The crowd gasped.

**Chapter 482: Five More**

320,000 was a staggering sum, yet Guan Yu spent it effortlessly. Onlookers watched enviously as he handed the jewels to Liu Shilei.

Tears welled in her eyes. She’d never imagined Guan Yu noticed every piece she’d lingered on.

He wiped her tears. “Did I miss any? We can add more.”

“Silly,” she laughed.

Guan Yu turned to Mo Ling. “Pick something.”

She blushed. “I don’t want your—”

“Changed my mind! That ring—buy it for me!”

Grinning, Guan Yu nodded at the manager. “Ring’s price?”
