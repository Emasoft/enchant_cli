“You were the one who offered yourself up. If I didn’t play along, wouldn’t that make me seem heartless?” Guanyu said with a laugh. “Yesterday, you told me to come alone. Was it just to invite me for tea? Or did you have other ideas?”

“Of course I favored you, which is why I asked you here. I delivered myself to your door, yet you still ask such questions on purpose. How annoying.” Xiaomei lightly punched Guanyu’s shoulder.

Xiaomei hadn’t intended to harm Guanyu. She believed she had the ability to subdue him directly, then use this wave of cultivators to bolster the Jia Yi Sect’s combat strength. As for the Ha Clan—their enmity was already entrenched, so they had to be eradicated completely.

“You do possess a unique charm,” Guanyu said, “but I know you’re not a chaste woman. You’ve been given to multiple men already. I’ve no interest in being someone else’s leftovers. Let’s just forget it.” With that, he pushed her away. A few casual gropes were enough—such worn-out goods held no appeal for him.

Xiaomei’s expression shifted instantly. Like a serpent, she coiled around Guanyu again. “Today, whether you want it or not, you cannot escape my grasp. Once I’ve set my sights on you, you’re mine.”

At that moment, Guanyu suddenly felt his head grow heavy. After shaking it forcefully, a wave of dizziness washed over him.

“What’s happening? You poisoned the tea!” Guanyu slurred, swaying unsteadily.

“Hehehe, only realizing it now? Too late. The tea’s already drunk, and the poison has taken effect. A bit slow, aren’t you?” Xiaomei giggled coyly. “Feeling lightheaded? Don’t worry—it’s just a mild knockout drug. Rest awhile, and you’ll be fine.”

Guanyu staggered and collapsed into a chair. After a few more wobbles, he lost consciousness. Xiaomei approached with trembling laughter, patting his cheek lightly. There was no response.

“Oh dear,” she muttered to herself, “did I overdose? No reaction at all… Don’t sleep too long—I can’t wait forever.”

As Xiaomei lifted Guanyu onto the recliner and began binding his limbs, his eyes snapped open. He shoved her away.

“You! You’re not poisoned?!” Xiaomei stared in shock.

She had planned to administer the antidote before restraining him, but his sudden awakening caught her completely off guard.

Guanyu sat up. “I told you—I don’t take others’ leftovers. You’re used goods. As for your little knockout drug? Child’s play. Trying to poison me is like brandishing an axe before Lu Ban’s door.”

“If you weren’t poisoned, why pretend? Was this amusing?” Xiaomei pouted, her youthful features twisting in frustration—an expression Guanyu found oddly entertaining.

Straightening his nearly disheveled clothes, Guanyu stood. “I wanted to see what this snake demon was truly after.”

“You knew? If you saw through everything, why play along instead of attacking immediately?” Xiaomei’s voice turned icy, surprised her true identity had been exposed.

“It’s poor hospitality to attack upon arrival. I merely humored you,” Guanyu replied. “But as I said—I’ve no interest in coupling with a snake.”

“You used your serpentine charms to bewitch the Ha Clan, but such tricks won’t work on me. Moreover, your knowledge of Miao City’s precise location proves you’re a demonic cultivator.”

“No need for alarm,” Xiaomei countered. “Though demonic, I don’t devour humans. I merely grew bored and sought a different type of man. Since you refuse, forget it.”

“Enough. Shall we duel here or outside?” Guanyu said flatly. “Regardless, I’m taking all Ha Clan hostages back today—living and dead.”

Guanyu found Xiaomei’s abstinence from human flesh somewhat redeeming. For a snake to cultivate to her half-demon state was no small feat. By semi-demon standards, her youthful, slightly immature face suggested she was still a girl.

Drawing his Soul-Severing Blade, Guanyu prepared for combat. Xiaomei—who’d only become a half-demon a year ago after assassinating the Jia Yi Sect’s leader—didn’t recognize the legendary weapon but sensed his power.

“The Ha Clan enmity can’t be undone,” Xiaomei declared. “To secure my future, they must be eradicated. The hostages stay.”

“So yesterday’s duel agreement meant nothing?” Guanyu frowned. “Then I’ll simply rescue them. Though you’ve cultivated for years, you’re still no match.”

Xiaomei knew Guanyu’s strength might surpass hers. With a roar, her petite form transformed into a seven-meter serpent undulating before him.

**Chapter 4531: Another Condition**

“Trying to intimidate me?” Guanyu scoffed. “Bigger doesn’t mean better. I’ve never feared snakes—your true form changes nothing.”

As he spoke, Guanyu drew Siqi’s crossbow and fired point-blank. Confined by the tent’s space, Xiaomei barely twitched before the bolt pierced her tail.

(The crossbow had been given by Siqi the prior night as backup to his pistol.)

Reverting to human form, Xiaomei clutched her bleeding ankle, weeping piteously. Guanyu remained wary—this cunning serpent’s tears might precede a strike.

Suddenly, a yellow python lunged from behind. Guanyu spun, blade arcing downward. The snake barely retracted its head in time.

“Xiao Huang, retreat! You can’t win!” Xiaomei cried. The python slithered beneath the recliner—another nascent semi-demon companion.

“Consider this my victory,” Guanyu stated. “Have your subordinates stand down. I’m taking the Ha Clan.”

“Wait!” Xiaomei halted him. Meeting her resentful gaze, Guanyu risked approaching to remove the bolt. “Channel your spiritual energy—it’ll heal quickly.”

“Let’s negotiate mutually beneficial terms.” Limping upright, Xiaomei proposed, “I’ll lead you to Miao City… if you ensure the Ha Clan never seek revenge.”

Guanyu agreed reluctantly, recalling Ma Zhagen’s tribal horn—a token guaranteeing the Ha Clan’s compliance. After pledging his honor, Xiaomei requested healing for her “cruel wound.”

As Guanyu mended her injury using spiritual energy, Xiaomei mused: “Curious about the Ha Clan’s secret? Their men’s vigor, the elder’s longevity—all from an ancient well beneath their wooden tower.”

Guanyu dismissed claims of mystical waters but agreed to investigate later. Eager to leave before further entanglements, he departed after reaffirming their deal.

**Chapter 4532: Straight Talk**

That evening, Ha Clan celebrations erupted as Guanyu returned their people. During the feast, Guanyu presented the tribal horn. “Your promise—one request.”

“Speak freely!” Ma Zhagen boomed.

Guanyu explained the truce terms. Though uneasy about forgiving Xiaomei’s atrocities, the Ha Clan honored their pledge through the horn’s authority.

As revelry continued, Xiaomei’s parting words echoed in Guanyu’s mind: “The harder you resist, the more I want you. This isn’t over.”

But for now, peace held—and the path to Miao City lay open.
