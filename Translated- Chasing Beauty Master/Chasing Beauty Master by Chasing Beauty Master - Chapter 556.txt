Bika Cat grinned, then suddenly seemed to remember something. "By the way," it said, "you should tell her about Locke and the Battle Wolf Mercenary Corps joining forces against the elves! Once she knows, she'll definitely stop helping Locke!"

"You make it sound simple," came the reply. "Knowing Amy, she'll desperately try to return and inform Patriarch Allen upon hearing this news. That commotion alone would waste at least a month. Her poison only allows three months total – with the first two being crucial for detoxification. If we miss that window, Amy will die!"

"Now I understand. Should anything happen to Amy, Patriarch Allen would be devastated. Even if we save the elves, he wouldn't want to keep living."

"Exactly! That's why I'm not telling him yet – and neither should you."

"But what if he hears it from someone else?"

"Someone else? Who else knows besides you and me?"

"Liu Yishou!"

"Don't worry about him. Liu doesn't even know who Locke is – he won't talk."

"There's another person!" Bika Cat pressed.

Guanyu followed this train of thought and suddenly slapped his thigh. "You mean Wolfbane Flower?"

"Exactly. I think she's highly likely to spread it!"

**Chapter 1408: Friend or Foe?**

Guanyu's expression changed. "Damn it! We need to stop her immediately!"

Meanwhile, Amy remained convinced that Guanyu was a coward, completely different from the heroic figure she'd once known. This misunderstanding weighed heavily on her heart.

Across from her, Wolfbane Flower observed everything with clarity. As a werewolf with simple emotional understanding, she couldn't comprehend why humans complicated relationships so much – two people who cared for each other growing distant over petty misunderstandings.

"Amy, why didn't you speak your mind when you saw Guanyu earlier?"

"What are talking about?" Amy protested.

"You know exactly what I mean!"

"I don't!"

"Really? Then let me explain what kind of person your 'Dragon Brother' truly is! You call him cowardly, but do you know why he keeps me here? It's all because of you!"

"Because of me?" Amy's eyes narrowed suspiciously, wondering if this was some scheme between Guanyu and the werewolf.

"Yes! Have you forgotten the elf who fled your Sacred Forest a month ago?"

"You mean Locke?"

"That's right! After Guanyu defeated that elf Locke, he encountered our Battle Wolf Mercenaries during his escape. Whatever he told them earned him an audience with our branch leader."

"What happened next?" Amy's heart sank with growing dread, realizing how much had been hidden from her.

"Knowing Locke, what do you think he'd do?"

"He'd seek revenge – though I don't know how."

Amy's answer made Wolfbane Flower nod approvingly. "You and Guanyu share similar views. Locke's no good, but you fail to see what Guanyu does – not only does he anticipate Locke's revenge, but also his alliance with our mercenaries!"

"Alliance? With you?"

"Precisely. Alone, Locke might target Guanyu or your Patriarch. But with our forces? His ambitions grow exponentially. That petty grudge-holder won't stop until he drags your entire Sacred Forest into war!"

Even naive Amy understood the implications. "So...I've wronged Dragon Brother?"

"Wronged? You've utterly misjudged him! This human devotes himself to your elven affairs – nearly died fighting Ding Hu Fa, loses sleep over your safety, endures your contempt...while you?"

"What have I been doing?" Amy murmured woodenly. "He sacrifices so much, yet I called him cowardly and unreasonable. Those words must have cut deep. How useless I am!"

"Enough, Wolfbane!" Guanyu reappeared in the doorway, glaring. "Do you think this helps Amy? Don't presume to interfere. I'll release you, but if we meet again..." His unspoken threat hung heavy.

"For Amy's sake, I'll keep silent. Satisfied?"

Strangely, Amy's influence had made Guanyu trust the werewolf. Her presence taught him unexpected lessons about faith between individuals.

True to his word, Guanyu approached Wolfbane Flower and waved his hand. Her bonds dissolved instantly.

Footsteps echoed as the innkeeper and Liu Yishou appeared, shock written on their faces.

"You released her? What madness is this?"

"She's a werewolf! What if she kills again?"

Guanyu sighed. "What would you have me do?"

"Execute her! Or hand her to the magistrate!"

"Magistrate Bard? I met him hours ago – he'd piss himself facing a werewolf."

The innkeeper spluttered, "But Magistrate Bard's a powerful mage! Our town's greatest warrior!"

"Your 'great warrior' would soil himself before her. Should I deliver this wolf to that coward?"

When they fell silent, Guanyu pressed, "Killing her won't protect this town. Do you think werewolves would stop at one casualty?"

Old Liu suddenly interjected, "The truth is...there are more werewolves around Wasteland Town. Stronger ones."

**Chapter 1409: Guanyu's Strategy**

"More? Stronger?" The innkeeper paled.

"At the mass grave, we encountered Lang Tianhua – a werewolf matching Guanyu's strength. He's merely one of Ten Guardians in the Battle Wolf Mercenary Corps. Nine others equal him!"

The innkeeper gulped. "What about her rank?"

Bika Cat sneered at Wolfbane Flower. "She doesn't even make the list!"

The werewolf turned away angrily. "Ugly mutt pretending to be human," the cat taunted. "Makes me sick!"

"And you're a talking cat!" Wolfbane shot back. "Equally disgusting!"

"Ahem!" Amy scooped up Bika Cat. "Behave, or I'll stop liking you!"

The threat worked instantly. "Little kitten listens to you!" Liu's granddaughter Spring giggled.

"Who you calling kitten?" Bika Cat grumbled, though silenced by Amy's embrace.

"Enough!" Guanyu's command cut through the chatter. "We need strategy before war arrives!"

Surprisingly, Wolfbane Flower stood. "After seeing your integrity, I'll stay and help."

All eyes turned to Guanyu. After studying her sincerity, he declined. "Return instead. Tell your leader this – if he allies with scum like Locke for petty gains, I'll become his eternal enemy. But if he surrenders Locke, I'll remember the favor."

Wolfbane Flower trembled under Guanyu's gaze. Though young, his conviction dwarfed even her battle-hardened captain's.

After contemplation, she vowed, "I'll deliver your message and prevent this bloodshed."

**Chapter 1410: Peace Through Understanding**

Guanyu bowed slightly. "My thanks."

Wolfbane Flower chuckled. "Had you shown this courtesy earlier..." She shook her head. "No matter. I must hurry to stop Locke."

"Go now, before these old men change their minds."

The innkeeper flushed. "We support your decision! Handing her to Bard would bring worse retaliation. This way preserves peace!"

"Exactly," Guanyu nodded. "By showing goodwill, we turn enemies to allies. The wise path avoids unnecessary conflict."
