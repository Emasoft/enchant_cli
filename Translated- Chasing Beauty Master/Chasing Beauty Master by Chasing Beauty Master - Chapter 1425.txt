Yan Zhao said with an innocent expression, "Didn't Guan Yu say that fifty taels were allocated for renting me a room tonight? Has the money already been spent?"

"Exactly. It's been spent."

"Then those fifty taels are already gone, right?" Yan Zhao persisted with sophistry. "Since the money's already been spent and the room was meant for me, if I choose not to stay now, shouldn't the refund belong to me? Since Guan Yu already spent the fifty taels, that means the money isn't his anymore, correct?"

Yan Zhao continued, "Put yourself in my position. If I were to occupy this room after Guan Yu spent fifty taels, and then decide not to stay, wouldn't those fifty taels naturally belong to me? Since it's my money now, why shouldn't I claim it?"

Though aware Yan Zhao was exploiting loopholes, Wang Xiaorong found herself unable to refute. She ignored him anyway – fifty taels meant little in her eyes. It depended on Guan Yu's decision.

Guan Yu countered, "Your reasoning is flawed. While I did spend fifty taels to rent your room, that silver was specifically for lodging purposes. If you choose not to stay, of course I should reclaim it. The room was yours, but the silver never belonged to you."

"Come now, Guan Yu. Don't be so stingy," Yan Zhao said discontentedly. "Taking back money you've already given – that's not how a man of means should behave."

Guan Yu considered this. Arguing over fifty taels indeed seemed trivial. Just as he decided to drop the matter, a receptionist interjected, "Sir, you've already received the room key and signed the agreement. Regardless of occupancy, we cannot issue refunds."

"What kind of absurd policy is this?" Yan Zhao exclaimed angrily. "I just paid minutes ago! The room hasn't even been used! Are you saying it's too late for a refund? Is this daylight robbery? I demand my money back immediately! This is sheer tyranny!"

Guan Yu watched Yan Zhao's shameless antics with a cold smile, the man resembling nothing so much as a street hooligan.

"Xiaorong, let's inspect our rooms first. If unsatisfactory, we can request changes later. We should store our luggage anyway," Guan Yu suggested. Nodding obediently, Wang Xiaorong followed him to their suite.

Upon entering, they gasped. The first-class suite lived up to its name – an expansive sitting area with complete furnishings, leading to a bedroom through the left-hand door.

"Wow! Spacious despite the cost! This is truly impressive," Wang Xiaorong marveled.

Surveying the decor, Guan Yu noted the absence of traditional Chinese elements – likely due to cost considerations. A Western-style rectangular wooden sofa by the window caught his attention, uncommon in this region.

Wang Xiaorong plopped onto the sofa laughing, "Look how wide this seat is! You could practically sleep here!"

"That's called a sofa," Guan Yu explained with a wry smile. "Unique to my homeland. This confirms my suspicion – the inn's designer must be from my world."

"Are you certain?" Wang Xiaorong questioned. "Perhaps the owner simply has innovative vision. Maybe he visited your world and brought back these novelties."

Dropping his heavy bag, Guan Yu settled on the sofa. "Plausible. But if he's traveled to my homeland, he's no ordinary man. I'd very much like to meet him."

"What's so special? At best he's a skilled mortal. As Demon Soul Sect's Young Mistress, I know all notable Jianghu figures. His name escapes me."

"Truly? I underestimated you," Guan Yu chuckled. "Care to accompany me in seeking this mystery man?"

"Certainly. But shouldn't we dine first?" Wang Xiaorong patted her stomach. "I've gone half a day without food."

"Agreed. Let's leave our things here." Guan Yu checked the bedroom – surprisingly large with an unconventional wide bed frame, contrasting local heated kang platforms.

"This sleeping area? Everything else is splendid, but this bed seems hastily made," Wang Xiaorong criticized, eyeing the thickly padded plank.

Guan Yu laughed. "This resembles my homeland's style – spacious comfort. Your people's conservative thinking can't appreciate modern design."

Chapter 3706: The Great Benefactor

"Let's head north on Five-Star Street to meet this Wang," Guan Yu proposed, exiting.

Downstairs, they found Yan Zhao still arguing furiously with receptionists. Spotting Guan Yu, he cried, "Perfect timing! Tell them to refund my room!"

Guan Yu merely nodded at the staff and walked out, ignoring him. Wang Xiaorong followed gleefully as Yan Zhao raved like a rabid dog snapping at anyone in sight.

On the bustling main thoroughfare, Wang Xiaorong remarked, "Surprisingly crowded for a small town."

"Indeed. Everywhere seems populated here," Guan Yu observed, contrasting modern urban sprawl with this concentrated settlement.

"Yan Zhao's pettiness amused me greatly. Your Cloud Azure Sect truly lacks decent folk."

"Careful," Guan Yu teased. "I'm Cloud Azure too."

"Fine, you're their sole virtuous member," she conceded. "Must you split hairs? He's technically under Demon Soul control now anyway."

"Since when do Demon Soul affiliates equal virtue? My father and Left Envoy are good people! Am I evil in your eyes?" she retorted.

Regretting logical debate with women, Guan Yu smiled. "All factions have good souls. You're my greatest benefactor."

"Better."

As they bantered northward, Guan Yu paused at a vegetable stall. The vendor's enthusiasm vanished upon realizing he wasn't buying.

Undeterred, they entered Du Niang's Textiles – walls lined with fabrics emitting pungent dye odors. A portly shopkeeper greeted them: "Finest selection in town!"

"Can we have clothes tailored here?" Guan Yu inquired.

"Apologies, we only sell fabric. The tailor's next door," came the reply.

After feigning interest in materials, Guan Yu casually asked, "Might you know a Mr. Wang who runs the Handsome Inn southward?"

The shopkeeper shook his head. "New establishment – owner's unknown. Heard it's uniquely designed though."

Disappointed, Guan Yu left silver for their time despite purchasing nothing. The shopkeeper marveled at his generosity.

Exiting, Wang Xiaorong teased, "Why the charade? Should've just paid for information."

Guan Yu smiled cryptically as they continued their quest through the literary town's labyrinthine streets.
