“Guan Yu didn’t have cash on hand, but the money in his bank card was indeed enough to buy a car. First, there were six people in his group. A regular sedan wouldn’t fit them all, so a business van would be more practical.

However, most vehicles here were ordinary compact sedans and agricultural trucks—no business vans in sight, and all cars were low-grade.

Guan Yu found it strange. This developing suburban area shouldn’t lack sophistication. Many luxury cars roamed the roads, indicating no shortage of wealthy residents. Why were all vehicles here so outdated?

Spotting a Jinbei minivan nearby—a nine-seater—he approached, only to recoil at its dilapidated exterior. The label revealed it was eleven years old. “This clunker shouldn’t even be sold. It’d break down mid-journey,” he muttered.

Second to Wolf remarked, “Seems this is a poor area. This is the only van available. Let’s just buy it—it’s cheap.”

Guan Yu shook his head. “Too old. I’d rather get two sedans. At least pick something newer.”

The used car market resembled a vast plaza, vehicles parked like a courtyard army. Peddlers hovered, ready to pitch.

A middle-aged woman approached, her face shielded by a sun hat and floral scarf. Second to Wolf noted her already-tanned skin. *Why fear the sun now?*

“Looking to buy? What’s your budget or preferred brand?” she rapid-fired in a thick accent, deliberately slowing for comprehension.

Guan Yu seized the guide. “A spacious business van. Haven’t seen anything suitable here.”

She eyed his muddy tracksuit—no watch, no designer bag. *Young, dirty, likely broke.* Yet she pressed, “Sir, your budget?”

“Money isn’t an issue. Show us quality,” Second to Wolf interjected, catching her disdain.

Swallowing skepticism, she led them past the yard’s junk to a gleaming exhibition hall. “Low-grade cars outside. Premium ones here—five floors, ascending by price.”

Guan Yu clarified, “Large business van. Budget under five hundred thousand.”

Her eyes glinted—this sale promised fat commissions. “Right this way, gentlemen!”

On the second floor, a white Toyota van caught Guan Yu’s eye. “Three years old. Three ninety thousand,” a lethargic dealer offered.

The woman whispered, “Overpriced. Let’s see others.”

They moved to a black Volkswagen. The dealer and woman exchanged glances—a kickback scheme. “Four years, fifty thousand kilometers. Top condition!” he pitched.

“Price?” Guan Yu demanded.

“Four seventy-five thousand,” the dealer stated. The woman chimed, “A steal!”

Guan Yu scoffed. “I’ll take the Toyota.”

“That’s a wreck!” the dealer blustered. “Mine’s guaranteed three years!” He popped the hood, showing untouched engine parts. “All original!”

Unswayed, Guan Yu walked off. The dealer yelled, “Four seventy!” then cursed their retreat.

The woman scurried after. “He’ll lower it!”

At the Toyota, she pleaded, “Negotiate more!” as its dealer emerged—honest-faced, no pushy sales. Guan Yu smiled. “Let’s verify his claims.”

Second to Wolf smirked. The game was on.
