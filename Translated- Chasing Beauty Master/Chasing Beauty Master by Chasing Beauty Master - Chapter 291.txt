“Wait for me?” Xia Chengfeng pointed at himself, surprised.

Guan Yu nodded, suddenly smiling as he leaned in close to Xia Chengfeng, whispering slyly, “Teacher Xia, do you like my sister Shilei?”

“Huh? Well, a beautiful woman like your sister, no one could dislike her.” Xia Chengfeng praised without hesitation.

Suddenly, a mischievous smile curled at Guan Yu’s lips. He sighed deeply and said, “Teacher Xia, I think you should give up. Shilei already has someone she likes. I’ve met him—not only is he incredibly handsome, but he’s also got an extraordinary aura. Compared to him, you don’t stand a chance.”

Without a hint of shame, it had to be said that Guan Yu’s face was remarkably thick-skinned.

“Teacher Liu has a boyfriend?” Xia Chengfeng exclaimed, stunned. He hadn’t expected Liu Shilei to have a boyfriend so discreetly. The news was so shocking that he didn’t even notice Guan Yu’s intimate address of Liu Shilei as “Shilei,” standing there dazed.

No wonder she had been cold toward him—she already had a boyfriend. From Guan Yu’s tone, it seemed the rival was formidable. But Xia Chengfeng wasn’t lacking either.

“Know your limits. Don’t end up with a face full of dust.” Guan Yu patted Xia Chengfeng’s shoulder and walked past him toward the office he had just exited.

A great man once said, “We must despise all enemies strategically.” Another great man said, “If you wield the hoe well, no wall can’t be toppled.” Xia Chengfeng’s desire for Liu Shilei burned even fiercer.

His expression shifted momentarily before he called out to Guan Yu, who was about to enter the office. “Guan Yu, if you run into trouble again, come to me. After all, men handle certain matters better than women.”

As the saying goes, “Revolutionary fortresses are breached from within.” Since Xia Chengfeng’s fighting spirit was ignited, he needed to build a good relationship with Guan Yu.

Guan Yu didn’t pause, acting as if he hadn’t heard Xia Chengfeng’s overture, walking straight in. This angered Xia Chengfeng.

Liu Shilei was hunched over her desk, focused on work, unaware that Guan Yu had returned.

Suddenly, she felt a pair of hands wrap around her waist from behind. She stiffened, about to scream, when a familiar, gentle voice whispered in her ear, “Darling, don’t overwork yourself. You need to rest.”

Hearing the unmistakable voice, Liu Shilei relaxed, turning to glare at Guan Yu. She swatted away his wandering hands and chided, “Why are you back? This is the office! Let go—someone might see!”

“It’s lunchtime. No one will come in now.” Guan Yu’s hands, undeterred, grew bolder, slipping under her collar. He buried his face in her hair, inhaling deeply, and whispered, “Darling, they say people love reminiscing. Should we relive the past?”

**Chapter 736: Mo Ling’s Absence?**

To reminisce about the past—bitterness, sweetness, laughter, tears.

But the term took on a wholly different meaning from Guan Yu’s lips, laced with暧昧 and flirtation.

Liu Shilei knew exactly what Guan Yu meant by “reminiscing”—it was here that they had first consummated their relationship.

Though it had been under duress, that moment marked Liu Shilei’s transition into womanhood and Guan Yu’s into manhood.

Remembering that day, Liu Shilei’s ears burned red, her gaze turning hazy.

“Mm…”

A moan escaped her lips as she snapped back to reality, struggling free. “Guan Yu, stop messing around!”

But her words were cut off as Guan Yu’s lips met hers, his熟练的技巧 soon drawing her into passion.

Liu Shilei’s professional attire—a white blouse under a black blazer, pencil skirt hugging her hips—now lay in disarray. Two buttons had become four, revealing a glimpse of black lace; her skirt was hiked to her waist, Guan Yu’s hand roaming lower.

“Guan Yu, don’t!” Liu Shilei pleaded weakly, but passion overrode reason.

Guan Yu stood abruptly, pulling down his zipper. “Shilei, help me.”

Liu Shilei smiled coyly, complying as the office’s temperature soared.

Xia Chengfeng, returning for his wallet, overheard muffled sounds. Pressing his ear to the door, he lost balance when it suddenly opened, tumbling inside.

“Teacher Xia? I thought you left.” Guan Yu sneered. “Eavesdropping?”

Xia Chengfeng scrambled, claiming he’d returned for his wallet. After a tense exchange, he fled, casting a meaningful glance at Liu Shilei, who avoided his gaze.

Once alone, Liu Shilei glared at Guan Yu. “This is your fault!”

Guan宇 grinned, adjusting his pants. “Lucky he didn’t see anything.”

After tidying themselves, they left for lunch, encountering Xia Chengfeng again. Tensions simmered as Xia Chengfeng’s advances grew more persistent.

Later, discussing Xia Chengfeng, Guan宇 remarked, “He’s wasting his time. You’re mine.”

Liu Shilei agreed, resolving to reject Xia Chengfeng firmly. Yet, their conversation turned somber as they worried over their friend Mo Ling’s unexplained absence.

**Chapter 737: The Principal’s Summons**

The principal’s call interrupted their meal. “Guan宇, the principal wants to see you at two.”

“Why?” Guan宇 wondered.

“Perhaps Qian Younian’s parents pressured him,” Liu Shilei worried. “They’re influential.”

Money often brought power. The meeting loomed, its purpose unclear but ominous.
