“Of course there’s no problem, but your current authority level is insufficient. You must strive harder in your cultivation. The profundity of the Demon Subduing Sect far exceeds your imagination. By the way, since you’ve already obtained lower-grade spirit stones from the sect, why aren’t you using them for cultivation?” Jin Gang now exuded a new aura. Though his speech and demeanor had previously resembled an ordinary person, Guan Yu could distinctly sense his weakness. Now, however, he radiated a natural fullness and harmony.

“This thing? How do I use it?” Guan Yu blinked in surprise, retrieving an egg-sized crystal from his spatial ring with a flick of his hand. Though labeled as a lower-grade spirit stone, its translucent surface pulsed visibly with spiritual energy.

“Ah, I’d forgotten. Given what you’ve said about this world’s spirit stones vanishing long ago, you naturally lack the method to refine their energy. Remember this well.” Though Jin Gang affirmed that adults could cultivate, Guan Yu knew the reality couldn’t be so simple—otherwise, age wouldn’t remain a key requirement for sect disciples.

“This technique seems usable by ordinary people too?” Closing his eyes in concentration, Guan Yu instantly grasped that the spirit stone represented a path—one Jin Gang subtly hinted at.

“Naturally. Heh, you’re quick. This is the simplest yet most arduous method. Humans grow by absorbing postnatal qi and consuming mundane food. Their bodies accumulate impurities while innate qi dissipates, making cultivation difficult. Thus, one must cleanse flesh, meridians, and marrow to return the body to its primordial state. This ‘Foundation Establishment’ forms humanity’s most crucial cultivation stage. The process itself isn’t inherently difficult, but…” Jin Gang paused, weighing his words.

“Hoho, you have the means but can’t share them? Jin Gang, since we’re bound together, speak plainly.” Guan Yu’s smile revealed his understanding—rules and reality were conflicting.

“Correct. You’re clever. Given current constraints, I can adjust certain rules—but I require something.” Golden light flashed in Jin Gang’s eyes as terrifying pressure erupted from him.

“No need for obscurity between us. Speak your mind.” Though Guan Yu’s eyes glinted sharply, he remained silent. Jin Gang, it seemed, harbored his own ambitions.

“Good. I want you to elevate the Demon Subduing Sect. Though you belong to White Cloud Temple, this isn’t contradictory. However, should you bring your women into cultivation, they must join my sect.” Unconcerned with Guan Yu’s expression, Jin Gang made no attempt to veil his terms.

“Agreed. But Jin Gang—you’re no mere artifact spirit, are you?” Guan Yu’s playful smile belied his awareness. Though the Demon Subduing Staff felt fused with his being, he sensed deeper mysteries within Jin Gang.

“Truthfully, I don’t know. Though devouring that entity restored some memories, it matters little. While I live, I’ll live fully. In time, I’ll discover who I truly am.” Resuming his jovial demeanor, Jin Gang waved away the concerns like smoke.

(CQS!)

**Chapter 1179: Each Walks Their Own Path**

The next day, Guan Yu returned to White Cloud Temple with Jin Gang and their spoils. Simultaneously, Li Xi reported victory—the Song Clan’s defeat in the cultivation battlefield left their mortal affairs easily dismantled.

“What? We can cultivate too?” The women stared incredulously except Zhou Xiaoyou. Never had they imagined becoming cultivators.

“Certainly. Though tests and minor cooperation are needed. Relax your minds, close your eyes, and…” This wasn’t teleportation but partial activation of the Demon Subduing Sect’s mountain gate. With a flash, they vanished into its contracted form.

“Where…is this? The spiritual energy! Merely living here could extend lifespans!” Though Zhou Xiaoyou understood cultivation basics, this realm left her awestruck.

“My greatest gain from the inheritance grounds. Jin Gang, take over.” Guan Yu smiled. Today promised marvels.

“Ladies, greetings! I’m Jin Gang—your temporary instructor. Enter the gate one by one. Retreat if resistance overwhelms.” The golden-haired child appeared, charm radiating from his beaming face.

“Guan Yu, this…” Liu Shilei, the group’s steady elder-sister figure, voiced their shared uncertainty.

“The artifact spirit from my staff. Explanations come later—obey him now.” Guan Yu nodded. This initiation tested their aptitudes.

“Me first! Cultivation sounds fun!” Ever-curious Dongfang Huowu dashed forward.

The gate flared crimson—pale red deepening to blinding vermilion flames.

“Phoenix bloodline! Fire spirit body! Boy, you’ve good taste.” Jin Gang’s surprise flashed as Dongfang passed effortlessly through, emerging unscathed.

“Done? I’m a cultivator now?” The girl bounced excitedly.

“My turn.” Inspired, Liu Shilei approached. Pure white light illuminated her seven steps through the gate.

“Light spirit body—no cultivation hurdles.” Jin Gang shrugged, his planned favor inverted.

“Guan Yu…are we closer now?” Liu Shilei took his hand, eyes hopeful.

“We’ve always been together—and always will. Mo Ling, your turn.” Thrilled, Guan Yu envisioned their shared eternity.

Mo Ling succeeded too. Jin Gang reluctantly admitted the test’s difficulty—all three women possessed exceptional talent. Foundation Establishment? The formation would handle it.

“These four stay. Zhou—metal affinity, perfect for sword cultivation. Dongfang masters fire arts—ideal for alchemy and artifact forging. Liu—light affinity excels at formations. Mo Ling’s wood talent breeds spiritual flora. Boy, your luck astounds.” Jin Gang marveled.

Modern humans shouldn’t possess such gifts, yet Guan Yu gathered them all. For these four slots, Guan Yu must kill—harvesting demonic cultivators’ golden cores to feed the mountain gate. The thought chilled him.

Returning to reality, Guan Yu informed Wild Crane Daoist of the women’s whereabouts before rushing to Ninghai. Zhang Ziran lay gravely injured, Ye Qingfeng captured by Qingtian. Demonic sects counterattacked fiercely, though Yin Gui Sect gained ground with Yin Qianji’s defection and Long Group’s aid.

The situation churned chaotic. Fearing for Li Xi’s safety after her recent blows against the demons, Guan Yu raced against time.

**Chapter 1180: Direct Confrontation with Qingtian**

Resolving his women’s futures eased Guan Yu’s restlessness. Now reality demanded attention—Qingtian’s resurgence, Zhang Ziran’s injury, Ye Qingfeng’s capture.

“Life’s dull without friends and foes.” Aboard the Ninghai-bound flight, Guan Yu’s eyes glinted.

Though preferring straightforward solutions, Guan Yu acknowledged his current limitations in the cultivation world. Surviving Yin Qianji’s schemes taught him the necessity of cunning.

Power remained constant—to grow stronger required sharper wits. His bottom line: never be outmaneuvered again.

At the airport, Zuo Qingyi’s icy presence cut through crowds like a frostblade.

“Sister Qingyi, why you?” Though youngest, Guan Yu’s achievements awed peers who’d trained decades to reach Golden Core stage.

“Elder Zhang’s condition—they say only you can help.” Her stiffness softened—urgency overrode formality.

“I’ll assess him. How was he wounded? At his cultivation level…”

“It concerns Ye Qingfeng. Details await.” Violet energy swirled in Zuo’s eyes—suppressed fury.

En route, Guan Yu sensed Qingtian’s provocative aura. “Our ‘friend’ wishes a meeting.”

“Let’s hear the demon’s words.” Zuo’s chill deepened.

Tracking the fluctuating energy through bustling streets, they found Qingtian lounging in a shadowed bar.

“Qingtian, state your purpose.”

“A drink invitation. Interested?” The demon patriarch’s modern attire hid his nature behind youthful nonchalance.

“Speak plainly, demon.”

“Enemies then. I’ll trade Ye Qingfeng for Yin Qianji.”

“I’ll consider it. Fancy a duel now?” Battlelust burned in Guan Yu—their last clash via artifact left him unsatisfied.

“Killing you now tempts, but the timing’s poor. Three years—a fair duel then. My brother’s debt demands it.” Qingtian’s laugh held deadly grace.

“Three years hence, I’ll end you. Terms set.” Guan Yu acknowledged the truth—Golden Core stages differed vastly in comprehension and skill.

As they turned, a disheveled figure collided with Guan Yu.

*Thud!*

Numbing energy surged through Guan Yu’s meridians. The assailant recoiled, staring shocked at Guan Yu’s swift recovery.

**Chapter 1181: Healing Zhang Ziran**

“And you are?” The gaunt, unkempt man reeked of alcohol—invisible until movement betrayed him.

“Heard of the righteous rising star who crushed our three sacred sects. I’m Yin Qianjun—Yin Qianji’s brother.” The drunkard’s breath made Zuo frown. Guan Yu studied this Yin clansman keenly.
