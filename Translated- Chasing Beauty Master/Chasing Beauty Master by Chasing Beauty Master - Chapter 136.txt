“Who’d be jealous of a little brat like you? What relationship do we even have? Why would I need to feel jealous?” Liu Shilei retorted with an eye roll at Guan Yu.

Before she could finish speaking, Guan Yu abruptly pulled her toward him. Caught off guard, Liu Shilei let out a startled cry as her leg lifted, causing her body to collide with his face.

Her knee-length skirt rode up slightly from the sudden movement. Sitting at eye level with her thighs, Guan Yu found his face pressed directly against her inner legs as she stumbled forward.

“Mmm…” Liu Shilei whimpered, her face flushing crimson as she clumsily grabbed Guan Yu’s head. Yet momentum carried her forward, forcing her to cling to him as they tumbled backward.

Under normal circumstances, Guan Yu could’ve easily steadied them. But the heady feminine scent enveloping him, combined with her forward momentum, left him dizzy. They fell onto the bed with a thud—Liu Shilei kneeling over him, straddling his face, both frozen in shock.

The intoxicating aroma made Guan Yu swallow hard. Liu Shilei’s skirt had ridden up to her thighs, revealing the sheer lace of her ivory undergarments mere inches from his eyes…

“Shilei-jie, could you…get up? I can’t breathe…” Guan Yu’s lips brushed against her delicate flesh as he spoke, his warm breath and movement eliciting a shiver.

With a gasp, Liu Shilei rolled aside, burying her scarlet face in a pillow. “This is mortifying…”

Worse still—when Guan Yu’s lips had touched her most intimate place, she’d nearly moaned aloud from the unexpected pleasure.

Guan Yu turned to see Liu Shilei lying supine, skirt still bunched at her waist, her lush legs on full display. He swallowed thickly before sitting up and removing her pointed black heels.

“What are you—” She lifted the pillow to protest, but Guan Yu swiftly hooked his fingers into the waistband of her stockings, sliding them down her smooth thighs.

“Why…you…” Her breathing grew labored as she lay pliant, offering no resistance.

The room’s temperature seemed to rise as their breaths quickened in tandem.

Soft whimpers escaped Liu Shilei as Guan Yu kissed her silken tongue. Truly, as the saying went—couples quarrel at the bed’s head but reconcile at its foot. After their passionate reconciliation, they lay entwined, faces glowing with satisfaction.

No longer sulking, Liu Shilei nestled against Guan Yu’s shoulder, tracing circles on his chest. “You’ve utterly conquered me. Even knowing you flirt with others…I still crave being with you. I must’ve owed you in a past life, you tormentor.”

“When have I ever deceived you?” Guan Yu protested.

“You claim I’m your favorite—so why entangle with others? Am I not enough?” She gazed up at him.

Cupping her face solemnly, Guan Yu vowed, “Every word’s true. Being with you feels incredible—so warm and wet down there, and—”

“You rogue! Don’t say it!” She pinched him hard, cheeks burning.

*So he only loves my body?* The melancholy thought flickered through her mind.

Guan Yu immediately noticed her shift in mood. Activating his investigative skill, he quickly discerned her insecurity and showered her with sweet nothings.

Within minutes, Liu Shilei basked in renewed happiness, choosing to focus on his affection rather than rivals. *As long as he treasures me most…*

After lingering an hour, they dressed and left. With his romantic entanglements temporarily settled, Guan Yu felt lighter. Perhaps maintaining multiple relationships wasn’t impossible after all.

His improved mood evident, Guan Yu collected his friend Niu Le from class. They headed to a film set where Guan Yu had secured intern positions—though their real aim was adventure, not education.

After struggling to hail a cab, Niu Le complained about wealthy students’ flashy cars. Guan Yu decided: “Let’s buy luxury vehicles ourselves.” Their bus seatmates eyed them incredulously as they debated million-dollar purchases.

Arriving at the mountainous filming location, they navigated past security to meet the crew. The production assistant assigned them menial tasks—holding lights, running errands—until the irritable lead actor, Korean-Chinese star Park Xu, demanded they fetch drinks.

When Niu Le hesitated, Guan Yu snapped: “Get it yourself!” The confrontation escalated until crew members intervened. Though Park Xu threatened their dismissal, the production assistant smoothed tensions, reminding them these were privileged interns.

As the duo settled into their lighting duties, Niu Le gaped at makeup artists creating realistic injuries. Guan Yu observed the chaotic filming process—retakes, director’s instructions, the unglamorous reality behind the camera.

When Park Xu noticed them slacking, he berated the crew: “Fire those useless interns!” But Guan Yu stood his ground, unimpressed by celebrity airs. The resulting clash highlighted the stark divide between entitled stars and pragmatic newcomers.
