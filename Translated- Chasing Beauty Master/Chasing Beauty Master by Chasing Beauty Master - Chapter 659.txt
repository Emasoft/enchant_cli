Xue Yingfeng was considered a Second-Class Mutant, a figure of considerable prowess within China's superhuman hierarchy. Had their opponents not deployed two Second-Class Mutants simultaneously today, the battle's outcome might have remained uncertain. Yet what unfolded before him defied comprehension – a man casually clenched his fist, and ten figures several meters away shattered like clay dolls, their remains scattering across the ground. Was this reality?

"Ten members of the Tempest Society were crushed by Guanyu's grasp, their bones and blood transforming the narrow alley into a crimson river. Even battle-hardened warriors like Cat Eyes paled at the metallic stench, clutching their stomachs in dry heaves.

Xue Yingfeng frowned inwardly. "Brother Guanyu's power is unquestionable, but must his methods be so... visceral?"

Though ten pseudo-espers had fallen to a single strike, Miko and two other mutants closed in. The woman's sword darted serpent-like towards Guanyu's flank while her companions attacked in concert – one aiming for his temple, the other employing Dragon Claw Hands to strike shamefully low.

Guanyu mentally cursed. Typical perverts partnering with Eastern Island actresses, resorting to groin strikes.

Even facing two Second-Class and one Third-Class Mutant, Guanyu remained unperturbed. A faint smile played on his lips as spiritual energy rippled from his form. His legs scissored shut, trapping the groin attacker's wrist, while his hands simultaneously seized Miko's blade and the other Second-Class Mutant's fist.

The Third-Class Mutant smirked maliciously, twisting his captured wrist to shred Guanyu's thigh. Before the strike connected, Guanyu's legs snapped sideways with a sickening crack, severing the wrist that had once withstood tank impacts. A follow-up kick exploded the attacker's skull like overripe melon, painting nearby walls with gory fragments.

One Third-Class Mutant – annihilated by a single kick. The captured Second-Class Mutant's courage shattered as Guanyu's gaze shifted. With a wrist twist, crackling pops transformed the arm into twisted wreckage before Guanyu's thrust impaled the mutant's chest with his own mangled limb.

Miko froze in horror. Twelve combatants – two Seconds, one Third, ten pseudos – eliminated with casual efficiency. Only she remained, her blade now in Guanyu's grip.

"Spare me!" The Eastern Island agent's voice trembled. "I'll surrender! Serve you! Reveal all our secrets!" Her hips swayed suggestively. "I possess... certain skills to please men. Our island's plans for China—"

Snake Eyes and others exchanged lecherous glances, recognizing Miko from certain "instructional videos." Yet Guanyu simply shattered her blade. "Your charms and secrets hold no interest."

As Xue Yingfeng nodded approval and Snake Eyes lamented wasted potential, dark-gold light erupted from Miko's skull into Guanyu's palm. Her body petrified mid-plea, becoming lifeless statue. "Memories contain all required intel," Guanyu explained.

Xue Yingfeng finally understood the chasm between them – where mutants measured strength, Guanyu operated on divine scale.

Later at Xue's suburban residence, daughter Xue Jing badgered Guanyu for training after hearing of his exploits. Implanting cultivation methods into her consciousness, Guanyu departed at dawn for Mingyang Elite Academy.

At school gates, Sun Xiaoya awaited with breakfast from her mother – still believing Guanyu was faculty. Xu Ying passed by with jealous snort, later confronting him in class: "So you prefer older women? What does Sun have that I don't?"

Guanyu's gaze swept her figure. "At least she's developed properly."

Xu Ying thrust out her chest indignantly. "Who says I'm not? Compare properly!"

The banter ceased when Liu Shilei's assistant delivered a cutting-edge smartphone – sparking Xu Ying's suspicion: "Are you really Principal Liu's secret lovechild? I've begged for this model forever!"

"Want it?" Guanyu teased. "Become my girlfriend."

Xu Ying's cheeks flushed scarlet. "M-maybe if you ask properly!"

Their playful tussle attracted stares until lunch brought another surprise – former bartender Hou Jinshun, now radiating subtle spiritual energy. In mere days, this unremarkable man had birthed a wisp of qi through Guanyu's teachings.

Over meals at a nearby restaurant, Hou's newfound confidence shone. "My treat, Elder Brother!" The invitation coincided with Liu Shilei's airport errand, leaving Guanyu free.

The venue buzzed with affluent students. Among them, Yang Lin – once Guanyu's opponent – celebrated his girlfriend's birthday under Guanyu's discreet nod. Xu Ying's sudden appearance disrupted the meal: "Mooching again? I'm joining!"

Hou Jinshun's mistaken assumption "So this is sister-in-law?" earned Xu Ying's bashful glare and Guanyu's correction. Their banter shattered by a sneering voice:

"Yingying, whose girlfriend are you now?" A towering student loomed behind them, sparking familiar tension. Guanyu sighed internally – another tedious conflict brewing.
