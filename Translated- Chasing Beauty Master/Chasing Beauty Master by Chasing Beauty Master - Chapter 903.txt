“Second to Wolf” suddenly remembered that Guan Yu was still outside battling Karas. At this thought, he immediately rushed out, determined to help Guan Yu kill Karas before the police arrived.

Karas was the highest-ranking leader of this den. Eliminating her would leave the remaining cleanup to the authorities.

After Second to Wolf left, the remaining members inside began stirring, as if preparing for a desperate fight. Jin Hua swiftly countered, declaring, “Let me make this clear: the police have already surrounded this place. If any of you believe you can escape their bullets, feel free to leave now. I won’t stop you.”

Jin Hua’s bluff about the police was a gamble. In truth, no officers were outside yet—if they had arrived, Guan Yu would have already withdrawn. Tonight’s operation needed to avoid police entanglement, as killings, regardless of justification, would complicate matters. Their priority was to eliminate Karas and depart before the authorities intervened, leaving the aftermath to them.

Her words momentarily quelled the unrest. Some astute individuals began piecing together the situation. This den had long operated under the radar due to collusion between its leaders and certain police factions. Now, it seemed the authorities had outsourced the dirty work—letting outsiders thin their ranks before swooping in to mop up the remnants.

The police would later claim credit for the raid without antagonizing higher-ups, a win-win strategy. Realizing this, the crowd grew agitated again. Sensing the shift, Ganbili ordered his men to encircle them.

Outside, Second to Wolf found Guan Yu and Karas facing off beneath a railway bridge, ten meters apart. Their prolonged duel had reached a stalemate—Karas’s escape attempts repeatedly thwarted by Guan Yu’s superior speed.

Seizing the moment, Second to Wolf lunged at Karas with a lethal blade strike, its murderous aura palpable even from a distance.

Karas knew she was doomed. Struggling against Guan Yu alone had been arduous; with Second to Wolf joining, flight was her only hope. She dodged the sword qi but found her retreat cut off as Second to Wolf closed in.

Relentless, Second to Wolf unleashed another strike while Guan Yu attacked from behind. Overwhelmed, Karas faltered under their combined assault.

In a climactic blow, Guan Yu’s fist erupted with golden light, a tangible surge of energy illuminating the night. The punch struck Karas with devastating force, hurling her bloodied body against a bridge pillar before she crumpled to the ground.

Approaching the mortally wounded Karas, Guan Yu coldly stated, “This is your reckoning. You reaped what you sowed.”

“I’ll give you all my wealth—just spare me!” Karas pleaded desperately.

Guan Yu sneered. “I’ve no use for money. Your time is up.” He glanced at Second to Wolf, whose hatred burned fiercest. Men like Karas had cost him his child, his marriage, and forced him into this life of bloodshed.

Decapitating Karas with a single swipe, Second to Wolf found closure—a tribute to his lost child.

As police sirens wailed in the distance, Guan Yu’s group retreated without a trace. “Let the authorities handle the rest,” he said. The night’s objectives were met: Karas dead, her forces decimated, and the rescued left for the police to repatriate.

Back home, Second to Wolf and Ganbili departed immediately, leaving only Guan Yu, Jin Hua, and Ah Cai. The latter two grumbled about their exhausting efforts to break locks—unaware Guan Yu had intended the police to handle releases.

“You never told us the plan!” Jin Hua retorted. “Ah Cai nearly wrecked himself smashing cages!”

Guan Yu conceded the oversight with a chuckle. “You both did well. Rest now.”

Jin Hua huffed, preparing medicinal herbs for Ah Cai’s wounds. “Three days of this poultice, or his scars won’t fade. If he weren’t your brother, I’d let him rot.”

Guan Yu bit back a retort—experience had taught him not to provoke volatile women. Memories of Xue Jing’s tantrums, including midnight TV-smashing and blaring music, reminded him to tread carefully.

As Ah Cai endured the agonizing itch of healing, Guan Yu advised, “Cultivators need patience. Focus your mind through the discomfort.” Ah Cai obeyed, entering deep meditation within minutes—a testament to his exceptional discipline.

Recognizing Ah Cai’s potential, Guan Yu arranged for him to train under Second to Wolf. The latter, awaiting departure at the airport, agreed, seeing in Ah Cai a chance to mentor a protégé and add purpose to his solitary existence.

The next day, as Ah Cai underwent final treatment, Guan Yu reflected on his own stagnant cultivation. Despite his formidable combat prowess, his inner energy remained fixed at Second-Class尊者—a mystery he’d long accepted.

For now, guiding Ah Cai’s growth took precedence. Somewhere,候金顺 (Hou Jinshun) neared a breakthrough to First-Class尊者, proof that mentorship could elevate talent.

But Guan Yu’s own path? That remained an enigma.

The police’s dual victory—claiming credit while avoiding political fallout—left the den’s remnants desperate. “Better to fight than wait for death!” surged through the crowd, reigniting chaos.

Ganbili’s men tightened their encirclement as tensions flared.

Ah Cai’s rapid entry into profound meditation astounded Guan Yu. Most cultivators required hours to purge distractions, yet Ah Cai achieved it in minutes—a mark of extraordinary will.

“He’s a once-in-a-generation talent,” Guan Yu mused, resolved to nurture him. Proper guidance could accelerate Ah Cai’s ascent, much as Hou Jinshun had risen under Guan Yu’s tutelage.

Even in deep cultivation, experts retain environmental awareness. Yet Guan Yu had neglected his own practice, his strength frozen inexplicably at Second-Class尊者.

He dismissed the concern—his combat efficacy defied conventional tiers. For now, ensuring Ah Cai’s training with Second to Wolf mattered most.

When Second to Wolf arrived the next morning, Ah Cai’s final treatment delayed their departure. Guan Yu watched, confident his protégé’s future shone bright—a blade waiting to be honed.
