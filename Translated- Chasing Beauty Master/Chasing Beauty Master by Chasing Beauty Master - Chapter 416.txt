Dongfang Huowu (Dancing Flame) froze. Right—what did Guan Yu have to do with her? Why was she so desperate to explain herself?

“Enough, I won’t tease you anymore. Hurry home before your uncle and aunt start worrying!”

Only then did Guan Yu and Dongfang Huowu manage to extricate themselves.

“Hey, are you feeling smug?” Dongfang Huowu suddenly asked on their way home.

“Smug about what?” Guan Yu replied.

“About my family misunderstanding us!” she declared matter-of-factly.

Guan Yu nearly choked. Smug? What was there to be smug about? If she hadn’t stubbornly clung to him, demanding to be carried, he would’ve gladly dumped her on the Dongfang family and washed his hands of the whole affair. Ignoring the narcissistic girl, he discreetly activated his supernatural ability and slipped through the Dongfang estate’s gates.

Dongfang Mu had already learned of Dongfang Huowu’s injuries over the phone. Without fuss, he arranged for an elderly family member versed in healing arts to bandage and massage her injuries, then summoned Guan Yu to his chamber. “Guan Yu,” he began gravely, “you dismantled the Kyoto Branch?”

“Yes,” Guan Yu nodded, unsurprised.

Over an hour had passed since their departure from the police station—more than enough time for the Wang family’s influence to convene an emergency meeting, announce disciplinary actions against the Kyoto Branch’s corrupt leadership, and install their own replacements. News of this upheaval hadn’t just reached the Dongfang family; the entire upper echelon of Kyoto was in an uproar. Every major clan understood the Kyoto Branch’s strategic importance. Though many had previously schemed to infiltrate it, Li Yanming had proven an immovable force, deftly countering both coercion and bribes from even the most powerful families.

Thus, his sudden defection caught numerous clans off guard. The Song family suffered the greatest shock—having nurtured grand ambitions for the Kyoto Branch, they’d already prepared to insert their own personnel through prior negotiations with Li Yanming. This abrupt reversal left them scrambling.

“Father, this Guan Yu goes too far! This is a direct slap to our family’s face! And that Li Yanming—he must have a death wish, daring to renege on his promise to our Song family!”

Though Song Shaoqin had temporarily suppressed his hatred for Guan Yu, fresh fury now surged through him. Securing Li Yanming’s allegiance had been his personal achievement. This betrayal wasn’t just an insult to the Song family—it was a personal humiliation. How could he not rage?

Song Ziming, Shaoqin’s father, wore an equally stormy expression. Their family had planned to deal with Guan Yu after Song Daming’s sister returned to the capital. Clearly, they could wait no longer.

“Shaoqin, leak hints to Song Daming. Have him pressure his sister to rush to the capital immediately. Ensure she brings several associates from Hong Kong—tell them the Song family seeks collaboration.”

Shaoqin nodded eagerly. “And you, Father?”

“I’ll consult the Patriarch. He won’t stand idle while his grandson is humiliated.”

Chapter 1041: Sworn Brotherhood

In truth, the Song family wasn’t alone in plotting retaliation. Numerous Kyoto clans eyeing the Kyoto Branch now regarded Guan Yu with newfound wariness. Previously, their interest stemmed from the Liu and Wen families’ patriarchs endorsing him. Now, their perceptions had fundamentally shifted. After all, while few families surpassed the Liu and Wen in stature, even those elite clans had failed to sway Li Yanming. That Guan Yu—merely detained by Li Yanming’s subordinates through happenstance—had devoured the Kyoto Branch whole? No one believed the Liu and Wen families’ backing alone explained this feat.

Of course, they remained unaware Guan Yu had come prepared.

Following the Imperial College Club incident, the Liu and Wen families redoubled efforts to groom Guan Yu, not only granting him full access to their resources but divulging secret histories unknown to most, along with intricate clan relationships and Kyoto’s current political landscape. Their insights revealed the Kyoto Branch’s critical importance.

Having fallen into its grasp, Guan Yu would’ve been a fool not to seize it. As for handing control to Wang Dahu rather than keeping it himself? Officialdom held little appeal. At best, one might rise high—at worst, face future purges. He feared not for himself, but his family’s safety. Moreover, his involvement with N City’s underworld had forever barred that path.

No matter. All roads led to Rome. Excelling in any field could summit the peak. As a mere merchant, he now commanded fear from Kyoto’s young masters—proof his chosen path worked.

“Guan Yu,” Dongfang Mu said suddenly, “tell me your plans for the future.”

Male friendships formed strangely—sometimes bonding brothers in moments. Dongfang Mu had deemed Guan Yu worth nurturing after their single meeting at the Imperial College Club. Why else offer his sister’s introduction? As the saying went: if a friend offers his sister, he’s a brother worth keeping.

“Plans? Take each step as it comes. If unprovoked, I provoke none. If provoked… annihilation follows.”

Though spoken mildly, Jiang Ziqi and Dongfang Mu detected the steel beneath. Dongfang Mu marveled silently—some were born with imperial aura, an inborn majesty no amount of cultivation could replicate. Like counterfeit treasures, however skilled the forgery, they paled beside the genuine article.

“Guan Yu,” Dongfang Mu declared, “I’m decided—you’re a brother I’ll stand by through fortune and calamity!” While phrased personally, as the Dongfang family’s eldest son, his words carried familial weight.

Touched, Guan Yu proposed, “Then let’s swear brotherhood.”

“Splendid!” Dongfang Mu agreed readily.

“Jiang Ziqi, join us,” Guan Yu added, having observed the man’s reliable conduct.

Truthfully, befriending Guan Yu proved simple—he reciprocated kindness with kindness. Whether one was outlaw or commoner, sincerity earned his fellowship. Conversely, schemers found eternal exclusion.

Jiang Ziqi never dreamed of swearing brotherhood with Dongfang Mu—their statuses differed too drastically, let alone considering Guan Yu as his superior. Yet here Guan Yu extended the invitation, leaving him humbled.

Their ceremony proved simple yet solemn. Without Guan Yu’s likeness to bow before, they performed three kneelings and nine prostrations—a mix of gravity and absurdity. This day’s oath would later birth triumvirate rulers dominating commerce, politics, and military across China...

With brotherhood sworn, titles shifted: Dongfang Mu as eldest, Jiang Ziqi second, Guan Yu youngest. Thus “Xiao Yu” and “Second Brother” entered their lexicon.

“Xiao Yu, Ziqi—elder brother’s in fine spirits today! To drinks!” Rare exuberance colored Dongfang Mu’s words as he ushered them out, shocking his father Dongfang Hai into near disbelief at his son’s uncharacteristic behavior.

Dongfang Huowu, now healed, bounced about her room chattering of her “bandit battle”—conveniently omitting Guan Yu’s one-strike decimation of the foes.

Dongfang Hai chose this moment to ask, “Daughter, what think you of Guan Yu?”

Huowu immediately fidgeted. “Father, why mention him suddenly?”

Exchanging meaningful glances with his wife, Dongfang Hai inwardly cheered—previous matchmaking attempts had met blunt rejections. This bashful reaction? Clear interest. Their daughter might finally be settling down!

Naturally, they’d push this union. Slapping his thigh, Dongfang Hai declared, “How rude to linger here while guests drink! Join them!”

Though reluctant, Huowu found herself dragged to the feast by her mother. Guan Yu glanced her way but continued drinking with the men. Irked, she kicked his shin under the table. “Hey! Where are your manners? This is my home—couldn’t greet my mother?”

In truth, Guan Yu had risen when they entered, merely delayed by mouthfuls of food. Unfazed, he swallowed leisurely. “Mind your own manners. Fetch me water—I’m parched.”

“Why should I?” she glared.

“Recall your earlier promise,” he reminded, miming steering.

Blushing, Huowu remembered pledging obedience as his racing apprentice. Though humiliating before her family, the racing carrot outweighed pride. After hesitation, she complied.

The room froze. The willful Dongfang Huowu—fetching water? Not even her parents or brother received such service! What sorcery had Guan Yu wrought?

Jiang Ziqi gulped, tugging Guan Yu’s sleeve. “Xiao Yu, isn’t this… improper?”

Guan Yu waved dismissively—honoring her as apprentice justified this. Soon Huowu returned, sloshing water into Guan Yu’s cup before plopping down.

“Am I the only one here?” Guan Yu arched a brow.

Glaring match ensued—Huowu yielded, filling every cup. Dongfang Mu sipped his inaugural sister-served water with relish, drawing a paternal swat for his noisy appreciation. Jiang Ziqi trembled as he drank—this honor would fuel boasts for years.

The Dongfang family reevaluated Guan Yu anew—taming their wild phoenix spoke volumes.

As merriment peaked, the family patriarch—Dongfang Jiadi, survivor from pre-liberation eras—entered leaning on attendants. His iron health anchored the Dongfang clan’s flourishing.

Spotting him, Huowu fluttered over chirping, “Great-grandfather! Have you eaten?”

“Indeed, indeed!” The patriarch beamed. “I hear our Little Wu has a beau? Which is he?”

Before she could protest, he nodded at Guan Yu. “Young man—you’re Little Wu’s match? Good, very good!”

Guan Yu’s protest died as Dongfang Mu interjected, “Great-grandfather, their courtship is new, but mutual fondness blooms. Formal ties await!”

Guan Yu’s eye twitched—this “fondness” fabrication deepened misunderstandings!

“Splendid! Soon we’ll host grand nuptials!” The patriarch’s pronouncement drew familial cheers.

Dongfang Hai’s residence erupted in celebration. Aunts, uncles, cousins descended, scrutinizing the “son-in-law” with relentless curiosity. Matrons teased, juniors chorused “brother-in-law”—Guan Yu endured crimson-faced. Jiang Ziqi reveled in his discomfort, stoking flames.

By dusk, Guan Yu desperately sought departure.

“Xiao Yu,” Dongfang Mu reminded, “Great-grandfather’s 105th birthday approaches in half a month—attend without fail.”

“Elder Brother, I’ve Taiwan business—may conflict.”

Guan Yu secretly hoped to avoid further familial fervor.

“Whatever your Taiwan purpose—business, I presume—seek him if troubles arise.”
