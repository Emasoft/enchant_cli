Chapter 1976: The Son-in-Law Has Solutions

Xue Jing, a supernatural being, proved difficult to handle. Lü Mei remained under constant protection from Uncle Wang, making success unlikely. Yang Conghan needed no mention—not only was she a master herself, but rumors claimed she belonged to an organization best not provoked. Ah Mei stayed home all day, offering rare opportunities.

Only Lan Yu, who wandered outside aimlessly and constantly courted trouble, presented the easiest target. Thus Sun Xu ultimately decided to act against her first, planning to capture Lan Yu and use her to blackmail Guan Yu.

Sun Xu hired members from a supernatural organization to guard the hotel entrance—otherwise, his cowardly self wouldn't dare indulge in pleasures here. After dressing, he summoned a bodyguard: "I want someone kidnapped. Contact your organization's liaison—how much for this person?" Having decided on abduction, earlier action proved better than delay.

Sun Xu handed over his phone displaying Lan Yu's photo. "I'll connect you with our liaison. Maintain contact afterward."

After transmitting Lan Yu's information, Sun Xu dismissed the bodyguard and tumbled back into bed with Bai Jiao.

Meanwhile, Lan Yu shopped with friends, blissfully unaware of impending danger despite her father's discreetly arranged bodyguards.

The supernatural organization's liaison immediately mobilized members upon receiving the assignment. A tall, strikingly beautiful woman hung up the phone and murmured: "Kidnap Guan Yu's woman? Bold indeed. Amusing. Proceed as requested."

This woman was none other than Jones. She instructed subordinates: "Exercise utmost caution during capture. No harm must come to her."

"Yes!" The group chorused before departing.

After extensive shopping and farewells, Lan Yu drove her imported SUV home. Near a traffic checkpoint, the vehicle stalled inexplicably. Frustrated, she kicked the tire with her dainty foot.

The malfunction resulted from sabotage. Two black sedans suddenly flanked her vehicle—unfamiliar cars trapping her in between. Distant bodyguards rushed forward upon seeing the crisis.

Chapter 1977: Misunderstandings

Lan Yu's entitled upbringing left her fearless even in peril. She pointed accusingly: "You wretches tampered with my car!"

The supernatural kidnappers ignored her protests, confronting approaching bodyguards instead. Outnumbered and outmatched—only two bodyguards possessed supernatural abilities—the defenders stood little chance.

Lead bodyguard Zhou Laoliu, a hulking forty-year-old with fierce features, attempted negotiation: "Name your price. We'll double it if you release Miss Lan."

"You insult our integrity? Organizational rules forbid such dealings. Leave now if wise," countered the kidnappers.

Having already alerted Mr. Lan for reinforcements, Zhou resorted to stalling: "Five times the payment if you contact your superiors!"

The kidnappers conferred. "Fivefold payment? Their target's wealthy," the leader mused. A subordinate cautioned: "This violates protocol. Capture her first—let the boss decide later."

Changing tactics, the leader barked: "Fight or flee, weaklings!"

When negotiations failed, Zhou charged despite hopeless odds. His team fell swiftly, leaving Lan Yu captured.

Delivered to Jones per instructions, Lan Yu wasn't surrendered to Sun Xu. Arriving late, Mr. Lan berated his men: "Useless! How could you lose her?"

Zhou, nursing a broken arm, explained: "All supernatural operatives. Professional organization."

"Supernaturals? Who hired them?" Mr. Lan exploded.

"Contact the son-in-law. He might have solutions," Zhou suggested.

Enlightened, Mr. Lan called Guan Yu, who immediately suspected Sun Xu. Rushing to investigate, Guan Yu roared: "Sun Xu! Harm one hair on her head and I'll obliterate you!"

An unknown number called. Guan Yu snapped: "Sun Xu! You've crossed the line—"

"Oh, such fire!" A familiar female voice interrupted. "Your beauty's safe with me."

"Who are you?" Guan Yu demanded coldly.

"Come where we last met." The line went dead.

Remembering the location where Qian Yaoyao was previously held, Guan Yu sped to an unfinished skyscraper. There, Lan Yu unexpectedly ran into his arms, unharmed.

Lights illuminated Jones on her throne-like chair, surrounded by supernatural operatives. "Must you resort to kidnapping to see me?" Guan Yu challenged.

"Must you think so poorly of me?" Jones stood, hurt evident. "Had I truly kidnapped her, would retrieval be this easy?"

Lan Yu interjected: "She's good! Told me much about you. The kidnappers worked for a client, but she protected me."

"Client's name?" Guan Yu pressed.

Jones shook her head. "We don't ask names—payment suffices."

"Your organization?"

"Indeed. I reiterate my offer—join us, and I'll yield leadership."

Guan Yu contemplated. "What do you want? If within my power and principles..."

"My offer stands: join us, take my position." Jones declared resolutely.

"Boss!" Her subordinates exclaimed, shocked by her unprecedented offer.
