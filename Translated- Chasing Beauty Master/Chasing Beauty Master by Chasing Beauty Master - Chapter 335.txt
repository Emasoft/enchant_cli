“Due to tonight’s event, I went to the hospital to visit Mei Fanglan again. By the time Wen Ya returned, it was already past 11 PM, coinciding with this pitch-black situation where one couldn’t see their own hand.

Taking a deep breath to summon courage, Wen Ya strode inside.

The air reeked of foul garbage stench. Despite the midsummer season, the night carried an eerie chill.

Wen Ya involuntarily quickened her pace.

“Ouch!”

She collided with a solid figure, lost her balance, and fell to the ground.

“Hey, watch where you’re going!” Wen Ya rubbed her sore buttocks, fuming.

“Hehe, you little bitch, your ass is still so round and tender. Tonight, I’ll have my fill!” A sinister laugh echoed from the darkness.

“You... you’re Li Zhi? Ah! Help...!”

Hearing the familiar yet icy voice, Wen Ya paled in terror, retreating two steps. Before she could scream, someone grabbed her from behind, covering her mouth with a cloth laced with anesthetic.

Then, she lost consciousness entirely.

Wen Ya awoke to chaotic curses. She tried to stand but felt weak, dizzy, and in severe pain.

In her blurred vision, a flickering incandescent bulb swung overhead, casting erratic shadows. The damp, rotting stench filled the air.

“Damn it, Li Zhi! If you’ve taken Guan Yu’s woman, he’ll never let you go!”

That was... Bald Qiang’s voice!

Wen Ya’s mind snapped awake. She tried to scream but found her mouth taped and body bound to a chair.

Now, she understood her predicament: kidnapped by Li Zhi. Bald Qiang was also captured.

Turning her head, she saw Bald Qiang curled on the floor, bloodied and glaring venomously at Li Zhi.

“Guan Yu? Mentioning him only makes me want to kill you harder!” Li Zhi snarled, face twisted with rage.

Li Zhi’s hatred for Guan Yu ran deep. After Guan Yu’s retribution left him emasculated, Li Zhi’s resentment festered into vengeance. He kidnapped Bald Qiang and Wen Ya, subjecting Bald Qiang to brutal torture.

“You think you can laugh now? You’re the idiot Guan Yu used as a pawn!” Li Zhi sneered.

“Your mangled balls are bleeding—I crushed them myself! Hahaha...” Bald Qiang laughed maniacally.

Li Zhi’s face darkened. He lifted his foot and stomped on Bald Qiang’s groin, mimicking his own torment.

Screams and crazed laughter mingled in the fetid air. Both men’s lower bodies bled profusely as the torture escalated.

**Chapter 843: Rapid Rescue**

Guan Yu’s phone buzzed incessantly. Groggily, he answered to Mei Fanglan’s frantic voice: “Wenya’s missing! She never came home!”

Guan Yu’s sleepiness vanished. “Check a thug named Li Zhi’s whereabouts. Bring all his men to you—I’m coming!”

He dressed swiftly, kissed a worried Liu Shilei, and sped to Luo Cheng’s base. Interrogating Li Zhi’s lackeys, he learned Li Zhi fled to Chenggang Wharf.

“Find that van!” Guan Yu roared. “We move now!”

**Chapter 844: Drugged**

At Chenggang Wharf’s derelict warehouse, Li Zhi reveled in brutality. Bald Qiang’s mutilated body twitched as Li Zhi stomped his groin.

“Stop!” Wenya screamed, breaking free of her gag. “Torture me instead!”

Li Zhi backhanded her, bloodying her lip. “You’ll watch him die, then I’ll break you!”

Wenya spat blood, defiant. “You’re a coward. Face Guan Yu!”

Li Zhi’s eyes blazed. “After I rape you, he’ll know true pain!”

As Li Zhi advanced, distant engines roared. Guan Yu’s rescue had arrived.
