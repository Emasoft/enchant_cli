“I’ve never liked dealing with officials, but there’s no choice now. If the Left Envoy refuses to handle this, Wang Xiaorong will likely storm the magistrate’s office herself for Guanyu’s sake.”

To prevent Wang Xiaorong from stirring more trouble, the Left Envoy reluctantly swallowed his pride and visited the magistrate. Now that the magistrate has agreed to send investigators, the Left Envoy considers the matter settled.

Regret gnaws at him. He should never have spoken so freely in front of Wang Xiaorong. Had he not mentioned Guanyu’s refusal to leave, she wouldn’t have flown into such a rage. The whole ordeal has left him thoroughly vexed.

Upon returning to the inn, Guanyu wasn’t truly angry—he’d merely been putting on airs for the Left Envoy. He’d always known Wang Xiaorong would aid him. Had he not encountered Liu Yun, he might have ignored this affair. But meeting her ignited his stubborn sense of justice. Such matters, once touched, demanded resolution.

Magistrate Pang and Young Master Li’s atrocities were inhuman. Such scum deserved the harshest punishment.

Though Guanyu could easily infiltrate the town and assassinate them in secret, doing so would bury their crimes forever. The victims’ suffering would never see daylight. Moreover, any misstep might frame Guanyu with false charges. Their sins must be exposed publicly, justice served for the victims—only then would this matter hold meaning.

“Guanyu, I apologize. Elder Brother Zuo Shi meant no harm. Please don’t be angry?” Wang Xiaorong trailed after him into the inn, pleading.

“Your Left Envoy certainly wields authority boldly, doesn’t he? So righteous in his speech. But he’s right—you’re Demonic Sect members, not saviors. These matters shouldn’t concern you.”

Guanyu deliberately provoked her. He knew Wang Xiaorong’s heart was kind, far from wicked. Even if the Left Envoy refused involvement, she’d find her own way to help.

Pouting, Wang Xiaorong seethed inwardly at the Left Envoy. This rare chance to meet Guanyu—if ruined by the envoy’s arrogance, she’d be devastated.

“Guanyu, you’re not petty. You can’t truly be upset over such a small matter?”

She rushed to his chair, shaking his arm anxiously. Guanyu relented—there was no gain in prolonging her distress. Yet to him, this was no trifle.

“Lives hang in the balance—how is this small? The complexity lies in my involvement. With Yunqing Sect newly stabilized, I can’t afford clashes with the magistrate. Otherwise, why would I seek your help?”

Meeting her gaze, he added, “Need I remind you? In this entire jianghu, you’re my only friend. Without your aid, I’d face this alone.”

**Chapter 3,902: Differing Statuses**

“Of course I’ll help!” Wang Xiaorong insisted. “Why else would I travel so far? The Left Envoy’s always been curt—it’s his habit from the Demonic Soul Sect. I’ll reprimand him later. This won’t recur.”

“Good. I understand your position. The Left Envoy’s high status—second only to the Demonic Sovereign—grants him airs. I’ll deal through you henceforth to avoid friction.”

Wang Xiaorong brightened. “I knew you’d be reasonable! But how are you certain Magistrate Pang’s involved in that town’s slave trade? We can’t falsely accuse officials.”

Wang Jun entered恰巧hearing this. “Because Guanyu’s a trouble magnet,” he chuckled. “Anyone entering that town senses the rot. Only fools wouldn’t notice.”

Smiling, Wang Jun added, “Young Mistress, might we speak as friends before Guanyu? Formality creates distance.”

Guanyu smirked—the man sought higher standing through this association. Understandable. To Wang Xiaorong, Wang Jun was expendable—a minor pawn in Yunqing Sect, barely useful beyond sporadic intelligence. His survival of the sect’s purge was sheer luck.

“For Wang Jun’s sake,” Guanyu interceded, “he’s my dear friend and fellow townsman from our homeland. Could you grant him higher standing in the Demonic Soul Sect?”

Wang Xiaorong’s eyes widened. “Truly? You came from the same place?”

“Not together,” Guanyu clarified. “I arrived six months ago by chance. He’s been here over a year. We reunited unexpectedly at Yunqing Sect.”

“What fortune!” Delighted, Wang Xiaorong’s demeanor softened. “Of course! Anyone close to you deserves honor. Wang Jun shall answer directly to me now—no more enduring the Left Envoy’s scorn.”

**Chapter 3,903: Added Troubles**

“Rest assured about the Blood Toxin,” Wang Xiaorong added quickly. “The Left Envoy administers antidotes punctually. His poisoning wasn’t my doing!”

She watched Guanyu nervously, relieved when he showed no anger. Eagerly, she pressed Wang Jun: “You must know countless stories about Guanyu! I want to hear them all!”

Wang Jun froze—most tales involved Guanyu’s harem at Qiaoyuan District. How would the jealous young mistress react?

Guanyu interjected: “My past isn’t worth hearing. Ask me directly.”

“Nonsense!” Wang Xiaorong’s eyes sparkled. “I want every detail! Wang Jun will be my storyteller.”

**Chapter 3,904: Under This Young Lady’s Protection**

A knock interrupted. The teahouse waiter entered with news: “The Left Envoy secured the magistrate’s investigation tomorrow. They may require Guanyu’s testimony.”

“Splendid!” Wang Xiaorong beamed. “Inform the Left Envoy that Wang Jun now serves me directly.”

After the messenger left, she turned to Guanyu: “See? The Left Envoy isn’t heartless. All’s settled.”

Guanyu nodded—whether from fear of Wang Xiaorong’s temper or genuine effort, the result sufficed.

“We must return before they hide evidence,” Wang Jun urged. “But Liu Yun and her mother—if they accompany us...”

“They’ll stay at our teahouse safehouse,” Wang Xiaorong declared. “I guarantee their safety.”

Guanyu approved. “We’ll depart at dusk—darkness favors our movements.”

Magistrate Pang’s complicity remained uncertain. If officials colluded, direct action might be necessary.

When Wang Xiaorong suggested Wang Jun abandon Yunqing Sect for the Demonic Soul Sect, he hesitated. The sect’s brutal reputation daunted him.

“Why the reluctance?” she pressed. “As Guanyu’s confidant, you’ll want for nothing. Besides...” Her eyes gleamed. “You’ll regale me with his exploits daily.”

Wang Jun glanced helplessly at Guanyu, imagining the storm when tales of Qiaoyuan District’s beauties surfaced. Yet under the young mistress’ expectant gaze, escape seemed impossible.

“Well?” she demanded. “Under my protection, you’ll thrive! What say you?”

The walls were closing in.
