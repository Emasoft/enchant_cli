“Guan Yu, can you stop belittling the two of us? We’re perfectly content,” Xiao Zhi quipped. “You exist on an entirely different plane—we common folk can’t compare.”

His words struck a chord. Guan Yu realized how inconsiderate his earlier remarks had been. Perspective shapes perception—one’s station determines how they view matters. To truly connect with Xiao Zhi and the others, he needed to stand on equal footing.

Xuan Ming stored the remaining two magical artifacts. “The Meritorious Cauldron’s empowerment ritual will commence tomorrow noon. Tonight, have your masters bond these artifacts to you. This step proves crucial for tomorrow’s ceremony—the artifacts themselves will gain considerable benefits.”

Guan Yu felt no loss at missing out. Even had he received an artifact, he’d only gift it away. Still, he owed Little Lotus one from their earlier wager—though no deadline constrained that promise.

Siqi radiated contentment, cradling her jade ruyi scepter. The inferior quality of Xiao Zhi and Aze’s artifacts made them unworthy of envy anyway.

The two young men marveled at their prizes. Xiao Zhi’s former bone club paled against this new brush—while superior to ordinary blades, its true value lay in vastly greater spiritual storage capacity.

That evening found Guan Yu and Second Only to Wolf visiting Xuangzhong Peak. They discovered Zheng Shouzhu assisting with the artifact bonding ritual amidst the excited pair.

“Guan Yu!” Xiao Zhi beamed. “You’ve come to witness my happiest day, haven’t you?”

“Indeed,” Guan Yu chuckled. “My congratulations. Such fine artifacts merit celebration.”

After greeting Elder Zheng, Guan Yu noted Second Only to Wolf’s silence—typical for the man who spoke only when moved.

“Guan Yu,” Elder Zheng mused, “I advised Xiao Zhi that the bronze lock suits him better, while Aze should wield the brush. Yet Xiao Zhi insists on keeping the calligraphy tool. What counsel would you offer?”

“The brush makes me look scholarly!” Xiao Zhi protested. “That ugly lock holds no appeal.”

“Function over form!” Elder Zheng countered. “This brush channels water-aligned energy—perfect for Aze’s cultivation. The metal-aligned lock complements your path. Would I steer you wrong?”

Despite the elder’s reasoning, Xiao Zhi remained obstinate. Aze proved more amenable to guidance.

“Guan Yu, help me!” Xiao Zhi pleaded. “I truly cherish this brush.”

“Elder Zheng,” Guan Yu interjected, “how does one truly assess an artifact’s quality? And what determines these elemental affinities you mention?”

The elder smiled indulgently. “For neophytes, spiritual resonance offers the clearest gauge—stronger fluctuations indicate superior artifacts. Yet masters can conceal these emanations. In such cases, craftsmanship reveals truths—though none permit strangers to scrutinize their treasures.”

“Then how evaluate today’s acquisitions?” Guan Yu pressed.

Elder Zheng lifted both artifacts. “These rank as mid-tier—remarkable finds for juniors. Their unique traits elevate them from lower-middle grade. Artifact grading proves complex—three broad tiers, each subdivided, yet classifications remain fluid.”

“Compared to my Soulfall Blade?” Guan Yu inquired.

“No contest!” The elder chuckled. “Your blade nears immortal-grade—utterly beyond these. The difference spans realms.”

As explanations continued, Guan Yu grasped fundamental truths: artifact quality depended on spiritual capacity and spell storage. Those housing four or more spells earned the coveted “immortal-grade” designation—rarities beyond mortal reach.

“Your paired blades surpass ordinary immortal artifacts,” Elder Zheng acknowledged. “You’ve become Cloudgreen Sect’s foremost disciple.”

“Merely fortunate,” Guan Yu demurred. “But these elemental affinities?”

“Lower artifacts retain previous owners’ energy imprints. Higher ones develop spirit guardians that adapt to new wielders. Lady Siqi’s ruyi still bears traces of dark magic—time will purify it.”

Seizing the opening, Guan Yu advocated: “If Xiao Zhi loves the brush, let him keep it. Given time, won’t it adapt?”

“Adaptation requires years!” Elder Zheng countered. “With imminent missions, they need battle-ready tools. The lock offers immediate compatibility.”

Seeing Xiao Zhi’s conflict, Guan Yu offered wisdom: “These mid-grade tools won’t be your lifelong companions. Greater artifacts await as you progress. Trust Elder Zheng’s guidance.”

Aze nodded agreement. With reluctant grace, Xiao Zhi accepted the bronze lock.

During the bonding ritual, Xiao Zhi’s eager activation attempt met Elder Zheng’s intervention: “Conserve your energy! Tomorrow’s Meritorious Cauldron empowerment will fill both artifact and wielder.”

“The Cauldron charges artifacts too?!” Xiao Zhi gaped.

“Our sect’s treasure exceeds imagination!” Pride colored the elder’s voice. “Even Guan Yu’s blade will overflow with energy post-ritual.”

Guan Yu marveled—his blade’s bottomless reservoir finally filled? This changed everything.

Elder Zheng elaborated: “The Cauldron’s sentient stone assesses cultivation paths, granting five years’ advancement minimum. Combined with artifact synergy, effects compound magnificently.”

Xiao Zhi’s eyes shone. “Could I surpass Guan Yu then?”

“Dream on!” Aze chuckled. “He receives the same blessing. That blade makes him untouchable.”

As discussions turned to the Cauldron’s origins, Guan Yu inquired: “This treasure—crafted by some ancient master?”

“It predates our sect’s founding,” Elder Zheng revealed. “All current elders underwent its empowerment—including our Sect Master whose rapid ascension defies normal cultivation.”

Anticipation hummed in the air. Tomorrow’s ritual promised transformation—for artifacts, for cultivators, and perhaps for Cloudgreen Sect’s future.
