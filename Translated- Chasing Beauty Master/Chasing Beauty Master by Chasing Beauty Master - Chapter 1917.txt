Guan Yu continued, “Her behavior today was entirely meant to provoke you both, deliberately angering you and making others laugh at us. Jiang Yuan has been watching my embarrassment all along. Yet this isn’t Duan Ruxue’s true aim. She knows we can’t proceed without her, so she feels secure we won’t drive her away. In the end, only you two would be the ones driven to leave.

So I say, there’s no need for you to be angry with her. It’s utterly pointless. What does she gain besides some petty verbal victories? Expecting me to chat with her? Pure delusion. Did I go? No—I stayed here with you both. That alone proves she’s already lost to you.”

Hearing this, Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi felt somewhat comforted, agreeing Guan Yu’s reasoning made sense. Their anger had been futile, wasted on a stranger unworthy of such emotion.

Noticing their eased tempers, Guan Yu added, “Don’t dwell on it. Whatever Duan Ruxue says, treat it as noise. Whatever she does, pretend you don’t see it. As long as she poses no harm, why worry? I’m here with you—what else matters?

“I brought you both because I feared you’d grow restless returning to the Demon Soul Sect. Moreover, we might genuinely need your help. From start to finish, Duan Ruxue’s role is limited to guiding us. You two are different. If danger arises, you’re fully capable of aiding me. That’s your greatest advantage.

“Also, there’s simply no room in my heart for her. She’s merely seizing moments to boast—why let it bother you?”

After his words finally calmed the two women, Guan Yu inwardly sighed in relief. Had he not untangled their resentment, their simmering anger from Duan Ruxue’s provocations would’ve plagued him all night. Thankfully, the tension had eased.

Earlier, with Duan Ruxue nearby, Guan Yu hadn’t found a chance to explain. These words couldn’t be spoken in her presence without wounding her pride. Now, they served well to soothe the pair.

Seeing their improved moods, Qiqi obediently approached Guan Yu, standing behind him to massage his shoulders. “Let’s go explore later,” she suggested. “It’s too early to rest anyway.”

Though reluctant, Guan Yu acquiesced, not wanting to spoil their recovered spirits. Since neither had eaten dinner due to their anger, a stroll for food seemed fitting.

Walking the streets with Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi, Guan Yu noted how this place paled compared to the capital. There, entire districts buzzed with markets, shops peddling endless wares, bustling crowds, and lively vendors. Here, despite similar setups, the energy fell short. One street’s market ended abruptly, the next lying eerily quiet.

“Let me treat you to a meal,” Guan Yu offered. “We traveled all afternoon without supper.”

“Not hungry. No appetite,” Wang Xiaorong replied, pointing ahead. “Look—what’s that commotion? Drums and gongs… seems lively.”

“Ah! Street performers?” Qiqi exclaimed, leaping excitedly. “Must be! Let’s watch!” Having once traveled with her grandfather performing acrobatics to earn silver for her grandmother’s medicine, Qiqi felt a pang of nostalgia. Uncertain of her grandparents’ current fate, she eagerly dragged Wang Xiaorong and Guan Yu toward the crowd.

**Chapter 5038: A Bitter Childhood**

The gathering crowd confirmed Qiqi’s guess—a family troupe spanning generations. The youngest, a boy under ten, a girl around twelve, a thirty-something man, and an elderly couple in their sixties comprised the act.

Watching them, Qiqi reminisced about her past with her grandfather. Wang Xiaorong teased, “Qiqi, itching to join them?”

“A bit,” Qiqi admitted, hands on hips. “If I performed with Grandpa now, I’d be even better!”

Once agile in demanding routines, Qiqi had honed her skills through relentless practice, even cultivating inner energy. With Guan Yu’s guidance, her martial prowess now surpassed her acrobatic past.

She wondered if her restless grandfather still performed, struggling without her assistance. Though Guan Yu had provided ample silver for her grandparents to live comfortably, her grandfather’s lifelong passion likely kept him active. From a grubby performer to a refined beauty, Qiqi owed her transformed life to Guan Yu.

Leaning against him, she murmured, “I miss Grandpa and Grandma… and I’m so grateful to you.”

Before Guan Yu could respond, Wang Xiaorong interjected, “We’re here to enjoy ourselves, not dwell on sorrows!”

“But it’s true,” Qiqi persisted. “Without him, Grandma’s medicine… My childhood was harsh, unlike yours as the Demon Soul Sect’s young mistress, pampered since birth.”

“Are you mocking me?” Wang Xiaorong retorted. “Our lives changed after meeting Guan Yu. He’s treated you fairly—why mope?”

Their frequent squabbles amused Guan Yu, though now wasn’t the time. “Enough,” he warned. “Mind your surroundings—we can’t risk exposure.”

“What image?” Wang Xiaorong scoffed. “Dressed like peasants, who’d notice?”

“Exactly!” Qiqi agreed. “These clothes shame me before Grandma!”

Realizing his mistake in intervening, Guan Yu fell silent as their irritation turned toward him.

Exchanging glances, the pair burst into laughter. “We’re bullying him,” Qiqi giggled.

“A little,” Wang Xiaorong conceded. “But he’s thick-skinned.”

Lowering his voice, Guan Yu reminded, “Remember our aliases. Never use real names publicly.”

“Understood… Brother Wan,” Qiqi quipped, using his pseudonym. Wang Xiaorong nodded earnestly.

**Chapter 5039: A Dazzling Performance**

Applause erupted as the boy scaled a five-meter bench held aloft by the burly man, executing nimble flips at the peak. Meanwhile, the girl serpentined up another bench upheld by the elder, her ascent riskier but equally enthralling.

The elderly woman circulated with a copper tray during the climax. “Generous patrons,” she announced, “the best is yet to come!”

When she reached Guan Yu, he frowned. “I’ve no small coins. Either of you?”
