“Lü Mei immediately wilted upon reading the contents of the paper. Knowing little about Guan Yu, she feared he might truly act on his threats. She scribbled, ‘Let’s stop this nonsense, okay? This isn’t a game. I know you’re a kind person who’d never do such things, right? Could you bear to see such a beautiful girl driven to despair? Please delete that photo, will you?’

Guan Yu chuckled softly upon reading this. ‘Such an innocent and adorable girl,’ he mused inwardly, though his written retort remained defiant: ‘Hmph, depends on my mood.’ As he passed the paper back, it slipped from his fingers and fluttered to the floor. Lü Mei bent to retrieve it.

While crouching, she noticed fragmented pieces scattered nearby. Picking one up, she gasped. ‘Ah! These are fragments from the homeroom teacher’s phone! So his phone is broken... which means... that photo no longer exists? That damned rascal! I’ll kill him!’

Slamming a phone fragment onto Guan Yu’s desk, Lü Mei stood seething—her rosebud lips pursed angrily and her ample chest heaving in a rhythm that sent every male classmate into a daze.

Clearly, the girl had deduced the photo’s destruction. She furiously scrawled: ‘I’ll tear you apart, you cursed pervert! Scoundrel! I’ll never coexist with you under this sky!’

‘Damn, she’s seriously pissed,’ Guan Yu thought, shaking his head with an amused smile.

**Chapter 1781: A Battle for Pride**

After school, Guan Yu accompanied Xue Jing to the basketball arena. Everything at Kaihuang High exuded luxury, and the stadium’s facilities rivaled those of international competition venues.

From afar, Guan Yu spotted Lü Mei seated inside, flanked by the middle-aged ‘Uncle Wang’ who’d delivered her lunch. The girl now wore an immaculate white mini-dress that accentuated her pure, sacred aura. The plunging neckline revealed generous swathes of milky skin, drawing every eye.

Xue Jing tugged Guan Yu’s sleeve. ‘Husband, look! That stunning beauty over there must be here to cheer for you.’

‘Oh, that’s my deskmate,’ Guan Yu replied casually.

Xue Jing’s eyes narrowed suspiciously. ‘Another lamb to the slaughter. Pretty women attract trouble. Though I’m attractive too—why doesn’t anyone bother me?’

‘Who’d dare provoke a tigress like you?’ Guan Yu teased.

Xue Jing giggled. ‘Hehe, but I never lose my temper with you!’ Guan Yu flicked her forehead playfully.

Soon, the stadium swarmed with spectators. Wei Hongwei rushed over. ‘Brother Guan, Han Qiao’s crew is here.’

Han Qiao entered grandly with his entourage, though the bandages swathing his face undermined his gravitas.

‘Is this Sister-in-law? Damn, Brother Guan’s taste is impeccable! Greetings, sister! I’m Wei Hongwei, Brother Guan’s right-hand man.’

Xue Jing smiled sweetly. ‘Well met. You’ve found yourself a formidable big brother—his capabilities exceed your imagination. You’ll see.’ Her praise held purpose, recognizing Wei’s loyalty.

As Han Qiao’s supporters cheered his weightlifting antics, Guan Yu snorted. ‘Showoff.’ Summoning Wei, he ordered, ‘Ask when this farce starts. I’ve got dinner plans.’

Returning, Wei reported, ‘They’re ready, but Han Qiao wants terms. Says a plain duel’s boring.’

‘Let’s hear it,’ Guan Yu declared, striding center court. An oppressive aura emanated from him, silencing the crowd.

Han Qiao, now clad in skintight athletic wear resembling a superhero costume, thundered forward. ‘The loser leaves Kaihuang High forever. Agreed?’

Guan Yu shrugged. ‘Fine. But if you lose, just stay away from Lü Mei wherever she goes. Because—she dislikes you.’

The crowd erupted in cheers. From her seat, Lü Mei studied Guan Yu’s profile—this enigmatic transfer student who’d unexpectedly become her protector.

‘You’re already caught in the tiger’s jaws,’ Xue Jing whispered cryptically to Lü Mei.

Han Qiao hesitated, glancing at his beloved. His infatuation had driven this reckless challenge after hearing rumors about Guan Yu and Lü Mei’s proximity.

‘Deal,’ Han Qiao gritted out, knowing his odds were slim but bound by pride.

**Chapter 1782: She Dislikes You**

The duel commenced with Han Qiao’s furious charge. Guan Yu sidestepped effortlessly, but fell victim to a handful of flung lime. Seizing the moment, Han Qiao lunged with a concealed dagger—only for Guan Yu to vanish and reappear behind him, sending the brute crashing down.

Using internal energy to flush his eyes clean, Guan Yu stood unscathed. ‘Honor your pledge. Stay away from Lü Mei. She. Doesn’t. Like. You.’

Defeated and humiliated, Han Qiao slunk away. The crowd buzzed with mixed reactions—some sympathizing with his unrequited love, others scorning his underhanded tactics.

‘Why show mercy?’ Xue Jing later whispered as they exited. ‘Old you would’ve crippled him.’

Spotting a white-clad figure nearby, Guan Yu pulled Xue Jing close and kissed her cheek. ‘That was the past. Get used to the new me.’ His performance aimed to provoke Lü Mei, whose flustered anger he’d grown fond of eliciting.

**Chapter 1783: Seventh-Floor Office**

The scandalous duel dominated school gossip, particularly Han Qiao’s dishonorable dagger strike. The boy himself vanished without trace.

Next day, the lecherous homeroom teacher Liu Shuowei resumed ogling Lü Mei. ‘Come to my office after class,’ he simpered.

‘Discuss academics here, or not at all,’ Lü Mei coldly deflected.

Guan Yu interjected loudly: ‘Teacher Liu, why’s your time only available for beauties? Quite unprofessional.’

The classroom tensed as Guan Yu publicly shamed the teacher’s hypocrisy, his words hanging like a guillotine over Liu’s crumbling authority.
