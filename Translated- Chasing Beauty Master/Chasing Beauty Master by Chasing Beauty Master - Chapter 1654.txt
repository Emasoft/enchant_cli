“Lin Chen naturally had no objections. He believed himself to be the ideal candidate for captain, though he had to admit Guan Yu showed good judgment in appointing him deputy captain. And the most coveted position? Undoubtedly the treasurer.

Managing finances—a role eternally in high demand, as it had been since ancient times. Handling money was a responsibility Lin Chen embraced wholeheartedly.

**Chapter 4325: Feel Free to Come to Me**

With the gold now in his hands, he could do as he pleased. “Very well,” he said magnanimously, “I’ll reluctantly assist you. Knowing your limitations in managing so many people, Guan Yu, I’ll help handle the trivialities.”

Lin Chen cheerfully took the money pouch, opened it, and exclaimed, “Wow! The master is so generous—he gave us this much gold!” He chuckled, feeling suddenly wealthy and in excellent spirits.

Ling Su, watching nearby, snorted dismissively. “Lin Chen, do you really think you can handle this alone? If not, I’ll step in.”

“Unnecessary. I’ve got this,” Lin Chen retorted.

Guan Yu added, “I too believe Senior Brother Lin Chen is the most capable among the new disciples—a view widely shared. With his help, I’m at ease. I must take my leave now to attend to other matters.”

With that, Guan Yu turned and departed, leaving a beaming Lin Chen to call after him, “You’ve got good taste, kid!”

Ling Su’s expression darkened. From this moment, Guan Yu’s goal was to sow discord between the two.

Inseparable as shadows, the pair had always collaborated in mischief. Now, Guan Yu resolved to gradually drive a wedge between them—currying favor with one while alienating the other. Over time, resentment would fester.

This was Guan Yu’s first stratagem against them, likely effective given their petty natures.

Lin Chen, rumored to be a consummate pretender, would surely squander the gold on brothels and gambling dens. Once the funds were exhausted, Guan Yu would hold him accountable.

When the group faced shortages, Lin Chen would bear the blame. That moment, Guan Yu mused, would mark his reckoning.

At dinner, Guan Yu addressed the team: “From now on, conceal your identities as Cloud Azure Sect disciples. This ensures our safety. Let me formally introduce Senior Brother Lin Chen as our deputy captain.

His meticulous planning makes him ideal to manage the funds provided by the sect leader. All lodging and meals will be under his oversight. Any objections?”

“None at all!” Lin Chen chimed in gleefully. “Rest assured, Guan Yu. As your deputy captain, come to me for any needs. I’ll resolve them without fail.”

After settling the group, Guan Yu sought out Si Qi. “Care to join me for an outing?”

“Why not? I’ve nothing else to do,” she agreed promptly.

The streets bustled post-dinner, a testament to Qujiang City’s vibrancy. Guan Yu recalled his last visit to Echo Pavilion, where he’d met the Yaowang (Demon King) sisters of the Demon Sect’s Strange Demon Cave—clever women who’d long evaded their master’s notice.

Had it not been for the Eight-Sided Drum technique, their ruse might have endured. Whether they remained there now was uncertain.

**Chapter 4326: Invisible**

Approaching Echo Pavilion’s former location, Guan Yu found it replaced by Jiangpu Pharmacy. The once-lively den of revelry had vanished.

“Echo Pavilion is gone. Do you miss it?” Si Qi asked.

“Not at all,” Guan Yu shrugged. “Only the city’s wealthy libertines would mourn it.”

With Echo Pavilion erased, Guan Yu turned back. “I must visit the Demon Soul Sect tonight. Inform Wang Jun and Aze if I’m delayed—but keep the truth from others.”

Si Qi nodded silently, masking her unease. She knew Guan Yu sought Wang Xiaorong (Little Orchid), yet chose not to protest.

Though troubled, she trusted his return by dawn. Sensing her mood, Guan Yu changed the subject: “Qujiang’s nightlife is lively!”

As they wandered, a commotion drew their attention—a street performer with monkeys and a concealed cage. Removing the cover revealed a massive serpent, startling the crowd.

“Let’s leave,” Si Qi urged, paling.

**Chapter 4327: Losing Temper**

Escorting Si Qi back, Guan Yu departed for the Demon Soul Sect. At its gates, guards scrambled to notify Wang Xiaorong.

“Why make him wait?!” she roared, overturning a chessboard. “Idiots! Let him in immediately!”

“Calm, Master!” Qi Qi interjected. “Master Guan wouldn’t leave without seeing you.”

Rubbing her sore foot, Wang Xiaorong huffed, “Fools! They know him by now!”

“Shīniáng (Master’s Wife),” Qi Qi soothed, using the title Wang Xiaorong adored, “your temper’s flaring!”

Indeed, the title pleased her—a recognition of her bond with Guan Yu, however unorthodox. Wincing at her throbbing toes, she awaited her guest, irritation mingling with anticipation.
