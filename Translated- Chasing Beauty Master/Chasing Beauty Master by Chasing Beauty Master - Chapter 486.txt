The two beauties nearly gasped in alarm, quickly covering their mouths. Guan Yu approached them, inhaling their delicate fragrance, and impulsively lowered his head to kiss Luo Xi's pointed ear. With a startled cry, Luo Xi's crystal-clear earlobe flushed crimson. "You perverted dragon! Don't you know elves' ears are most sensitive?"

Guan Yu's weathered face reddened. "I... couldn't help myself. Truly couldn't resist..." Luo Xi rolled her eyes. "The intruders are here. Let's see how you handle this..." Before she finished speaking, the vine-woven door shattered like paper as ferocious beasts—three times larger than earthly wolves—burst through with savage energy.

The creature's azure fur rippled like liquid moonlight, a crescent-shaped golden mark adorning its forehead. Its eyes glowed with unearthly light, powerful limbs radiating majestic vigor.

Luo Xi's palms grew clammy as she urgently whispered, "Beware! A Silvermoon Demon Wolf—fourth-tier magical beast skilled in wind magic, equivalent to an intermediate mage. They rarely appear in Corxin Forest's outskirts. Did those adventuring parties provoke them again?"

Guan Yu shielded the dazed Ai Mi behind him. "Little loli—er, little Ai Mi—stay here. I'll handle this pup. Luo Xi, step back too." Pulling Luo Xi closer while suppressing the beast with spiritual pressure, Guan Yu faced the snarling wolf in tense standoff.

Sensing Luo Xi's tension through her trembling hand, Guan Yu gave a reassuring squeeze. Blushing faintly—now accustomed to his casual touches—she nodded and retreated.

With a confident laugh, Guan Yu advanced despite his damaged meridians. Though unable to channel full spiritual power, his Nascent Soul-level consciousness combined with Beast Control Art's hand seals could dominate any beast below his cultivation. The demon wolf instinctively retreated, growling low in primal fear.

"Disturbing our rest, pup? You're not escaping!" Guan Yu's consciousness invaded the wolf's mind as he formed seals. "Beast Control Art—SUBDUE!" The beast's ferocity waned, replaced by pitiful whimpers.

Watching the pacified wolf, Guan Yu sighed in relief. He patted its head like training a puppy. The "majestic" beast actually nuzzled into his touch, eyes closed in bliss. "Truly deserves kicking," Guan Yu mused.

"Dragon Brother! Are you a Beast Tamer? So impressive!" Ai Mi clung to his arm, youthful curves pressing against him. "Why call me 'loli'?" Guan Yu secretly savored the contact.

Kicking the groveling wolf aside, Guan Yu chuckled. "Go play with yourself..." The aggrieved beast slunk away.

"'Loli' means... charming young lady in my homeland. Beast Tamer? Essentially." Guan Yu deftly dodged cultural explanations. "We cultivators harness existence's fundamental forces."

Luo Xi stared in awe, forgetting her hand still clasped in his. When she finally noticed, blushing fiercely yet reluctant to withdraw, a strange emptiness followed separation.

"Wolf! Come!" The obedient beast wagged its tail like a domesticated hound. Guan Yu facepalmed. "Are you wolf or dog? Go away! No wonder people love football..." The kicked wolf whimpered reproachfully.

Chapter 1231: Departure, Destination—Elven Forest

Dawn found the group sleepless. Luo Xi stretched languidly, her silhouette breathtaking in morning light. "Daybreak. Guan Yu, Ai Mi—we must return."

Dazzled by her beauty, Guan Yu stammered, "W-what?"

"Big Pervert Brother..." Ai Mi giggled behind her hand.

Blushing crimson, Luo Xi studied her toes. "Since we're friends... you may call me 'hubby'. 'Guan Yu' feels distant."

"'Hubby' sounds odd. I'll stick with Dragon Brother!" Ai Mi innocently thwarted his scheme.

"I'll... try 'hubby'," Luo Xi whispered.

"Good girl!" Guan Yu grinned wolfishly.

Exiting their tree hollow, fragrant forest air filled their lungs. "Damn, no wonder elves breed such beauties!" Guan Yu inhaled deeply.

Spotting the hulking wolf, inspiration struck. "This brute could carry three! Crowded, but healthy proximity!" Visions of sandwiched beauties danced in his mind.

"Master's drooling! He'll eat me! I'm still a virgin!" The wolf quaked as Guan Yu approached.

Clearing his throat, Guan Yu proposed: "Ladies, care to ride this pup? Spares our feet."

Ai Mi's eyes sparkled. "Brilliant! I forgot demon wolves can be mounts!"

"Our stolen stag-horses forced this trek," Ai Mi pouted. "Evil mercenaries!"

"Evil Mercenary Alliance?" Guan Yu's brow furrowed. "Who dares harass elves?"

"Evilest people ever!" Ai Mi shook tiny fists.

Luo Xi took over: "Two major mercenary groups exist—the honorable Alliance and the dark Syndicate. The latter commits any atrocity for profit—including elf trafficking." She shuddered. "Captured elf women become nobles' playthings."

"I'll raze their headquarters!" Guan Yu vowed, heart aching for the shaken beauties.

Mounting the wolf, Guan Yu arranged Ai Mi upfront navigating, Luo Xi in the middle, himself behind—conveniently embracing Luo Xi's supple waist. Her body stiffened then melted against him, cheeks burning.

As Ai Mi reminisced about home—Elven Forest's beauty, parents' cooking, childhood friends—both elves grew misty-eyed.

"Then onward! To Elven Forest!" Guan Yu declared, chest swelling with the soft elf in his arms.

Chapter 1232: Blackwater Mercenaries

The trio's laughter echoed through sun-dappled woods, Luo Xi gradually relaxing in Guan Yu's embrace.

Halting abruptly in a glade, Guan Yu silenced them. The wolf's ears pricked—distant clashing echoed. The elves wove hand signs, green nature energy extending their perception.

Guan Yu observed their elemental manipulation—external focus contrasting his cultivation's internal refinement. Experimenting, he activated Nine Revolutions Mystic Art, accidentally triggering elemental tsunami.

Meridians screamed as multicolored energies flooded him. Luo Xi pressed closer instinctively, her warmth easing his torment. Ai Mi watched anxiously.

Gradually mastering the flow, Guan Yu's Nascent Soul regained luster—now rainbow-hued. "My majestic Soul! Now it's... cute?" He sighed. "But power matters most!"

Approaching footsteps interrupted. A blue-clad leader hailed: "Friends! We're of the Mercenary Alliance. Identify yourselves!"

A bound prisoner suddenly struggled: "Ai Mi! Luo Xi! Flee! These are Blackwater Mercenaries—"
