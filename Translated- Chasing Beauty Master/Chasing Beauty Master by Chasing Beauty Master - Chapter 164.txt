If Xu Dalong hadn’t kindly reminded Park Xu not to seek revenge, Park Xu would still be unaware of the immense influence the old man who beat him wielded in N City. Even if he desired retribution, he would have to carefully weigh the consequences.

Yet regarding *that person*, he would never let it slide.

Five bodyguards stood beside him, scarcely daring to breathe. Park Xu glared at them with bloodshot eyes and roared, “I don’t care what methods you use—I want Guan Yu dead by tomorrow!”

One bodyguard cautiously spoke up, “I know a highly skilled assassin. If he takes the job, success is guaranteed. But his fee is exorbitant.”

“I want him dead!” Park Xu snarled.

The bodyguard nodded and left to make arrangements.

A vicious grin twisted Park Xu’s lips.

**Chapter 403: Pursuit**

After a night of intense work, even Guan Yu had to admire his own stamina—though exhaustion eventually caught up. He slept until noon the next day.%&*";

When he awoke in the lavish presidential suite, he found himself alone. Stretching lazily, he noticed a note on the side table.

Smiling, he opened it: “Stay safe in Kyoto.”

Though brief, the words warmed his heart.

After a quick wash, he headed straight for the villa.

The moment he turned on his Nokia, the cheap phone vibrated incessantly until his hand went numb. Scanning the thirty-odd messages from Du Xiaojuan and Wen Qing, all inquiring about his whereabouts the previous night, he stuffed the phone into his pocket, opting for silence.

On the way back, Director Nie called: his driver’s license had been delivered to the villa and entrusted to Zhao Jing’er.

Guan Yu marveled at the convenience of connections—a stark reminder of the importance of power and influence.

This only solidified his resolve to attend the charity gala, unaware it would be both an opportunity and a trap.

Upon opening the villa door, he froze. Instead of only Zhao Jing’er, all three women sat on the sofa, arms crossed, glaring at him.

“I thought you’d be at school,” he said awkwardly.

Wen Qing smiled, though her eyes held no warmth. “Darling, did your reunion with an old flame make you forget it’s the weekend?”

Guan Yu coughed. “Ah, right—I’ve been swamped.”

“Out all night with Mo Ling?” Feng Xin cut in, her tone accusatory.

Guan Yu remained composed. “Wang Zhen invited me for drinks to farewell my Kyoto trip.”

Wen Qing tutted. “Naughty hubby—ignoring four beauties at home to gallivant. And you still owe me that *favor*...” She batted her dewy eyes coquettishly.

Guan Yu ignored the provocation, though impressed they’d even called Wang Zhen for verification.

Du Xiaojuan’s silent protest radiated from her wounded gaze.

Unable to bear it, Guan Yu turned to Zhao Jing’er. “Ready to go?”

Seizing the lifeline, she nodded. They swiftly exited the charged atmosphere.

Baffled, Guan Yu wondered why adding one more woman caused such strife when the others coexisted peacefully.

As they left, Wen Qing called out, “What’s this Kyoto gala about?”

Shrugging, he replied, “Some charity event at Kyoto International Hotel. Details are vague.”

He drove off without noticing Wen Qing’s thoughtful smirk after a moment of surprise.

Shortly after their Hummer departed, an ordinary black Volkswagen tailed them from a nearby corner.

Elsewhere, a man in black sunglasses phoned in: “Target mobile. New development—a black Volkswagen following, license plate...”

Unaware of approaching danger, Guan Yu chatted cheerfully with Zhao Jing’er, who chirped like a freed songbird:

“Big Brother, they say Kyoto has the Great Wall and Forbidden City! I’ve never visited despite living there. Take me?”

Guan Yu smiled. “Consider this our first world tour stop. Whatever you want to see or eat, we’ll do it. Let’s treat this as a vacation.”

Zhao Jing’er beamed, touched he remembered his hospital promise. This sweetness must be what her grandfather called happiness.

Her return to Kyoto now felt wholly different—once driven by survival, now by joy kindled through Guan Yu’s care.

Yet as they conversed, Guan Yu monitored the trailing Volkswagen. Accelerating subtly, he tested its pursuit.

The Volkswagen matched every move with professional precision. Grinning, Guan Yu engaged his gravity reduction system. The Hummer surged ahead, leaving the inferior sedan behind.

“Could you slow down?” Zhao Jing’er paled.

**Chapter 404: Ambush**

Noticing her pallor, Guan Yu eased off—her health outweighed potential threats. The Volkswagen soon reappeared.

A call from Fang Zhe revealed the tail as Zhao Jing’er’s security detail. Guan Yu chuckled at his paranoia and resumed leisurely driving.

The standoff lasted until two black Mercedes inserted themselves on the highway.

The Zhongnanhai bodyguards sensed trouble, receiving orders to protect the Hummer at all costs. Despite skilled maneuvers, the Mercedes boxed them in.

Alerted by Fang Zhe, Guan Yu tightened his grip on the wheel. The Mercedes maintained perfect attack distance.

One Mercedes sideswiped the Volkswagen while the other rammed the Hummer’s rear.

“Hold on!” Guan Yu floored the accelerator as Zhao Jing’er gasped.

Though the Hummer outpaced the Mercedes through raw power, Zhao Jing’er’s worsening complexion worried him. Her frail heart couldn’t sustain prolonged stress.

A gunman leaned from the Mercedes, pistol aimed.

“Get down!” Guan Yu yanked Zhao Jing’er onto his lap as bullets shattered the windshield.

Crouched awkwardly with her face near his groin, she blushed furiously but stayed still amid gunfire.

Wind whipped through bullet-riddled windows. Zhao Jing’er shivered violently.

Guan Yu’s enhanced perception showed her heartbeat dangerously slowing—back to pre-treatment fragility without medical support.

**Chapter 405: Jing’er’s Injury**

Clenching the wheel, Guan Yu spotted the Mercedes gaining. A muzzle flashed—

“DOWN!” He shoved her head low as a bullet pierced her former seat.

More shots spiderwebbed the glass. Zhao Jing’er trembled, lips blue with cold and fear.

Guan Yu’s heart clenched. Her pulse weakened alarmingly. How long could she last?
