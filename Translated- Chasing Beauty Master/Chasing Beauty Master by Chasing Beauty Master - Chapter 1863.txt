“No, because in the end, I finally discovered the issue,” Qin Huan continued. “After entering the capital, the merchant convoy didn’t head directly to our fishpond. Instead, they first went to a western district and unloaded some goods at what appeared to be a civilian residence. Only afterward did they proceed to our fishpond. That’s why the goods were short upon arrival.”

“Why? Who ordered this?” Master Qin roared, rising to his feet in fury.

“It’s still unclear, but I’ve sent men to investigate,” Qin Huan replied. “Moreover, shortly after the goods were unloaded, a carriage arrived to transport them away. Their current whereabouts remain unknown, but I’ve dispatched trackers to follow the trail.”

“How dare they pull such brazen tricks under my nose! Once caught, I’ll show no mercy!” Master Qin thundered, his face flushed with rage.

Steward Ma stood silently nearby, pondering. This matter clearly involved Qu Hua. Regardless of the goods, the accounts had been managed by Qu Hua himself. If Qu Hua had been embezzling the Qin family’s silver, this was no trivial matter. Should blame ultimately fall on Qu Hua, not only would he face ruin, but even Madam Qin might suffer collateral damage.

Yet Steward Ma felt a grim satisfaction. Given Madam Qin’s previous disdain toward him, her impending comeuppance seemed poetic. He resolved to merely observe the spectacle and follow Master Qin’s orders, avoiding further entanglement. His decades of uneventful service in the Qin household stemmed precisely from this philosophy—minding his duties scrupulously while turning blind eyes to affairs beyond his purview.

Soon, a panting man rushed into the hall. “Master, Young Master—I lost track of the cargo carriage.”

“Useless fool!” Qin Huan rebuked. “You’re trained in martial arts yet failed to tail a mere carriage?”

The man knelt, head bowed. “Young Master, they must have detected me. The carriage wove through crowded streets until nightfall, then entered an alley and stopped. When I investigated, both goods and drivers had vanished without trace.”

“Vanished? Did the cargo evaporate into thin air?” Master Qin bellowed, eyes bulging.

Qin Huan, sensing his father’s boiling temper, quickly ordered, “Return immediately and comb the area around that residence for clues. Find out what happened!”

“At once!” The man scurried away.

Master Qin’s rage simmered. Qu Hua—raised by Madam Qin since childhood—had become a viper nurtured at their bosom. This betrayal of their fisheries business was intolerable. Though restraining himself to avoid alerting their prey, the master resolved to uncover the goods’ destination. With Qu Hua bedridden from injuries, escape was impossible. “Huan, continue investigating. Summon the convoy members and trace those diverted goods.”

The night promised no rest until this matter—a grave threat to Qin interests—was resolved. By midnight, all fishery overseers stood assembled in the Qin manor’s hall under Master Qin’s glacial scrutiny.

“Who oversees transportation for the fishing village operations?” The patriarch’s voice cut through the tense air.

A grizzled, muscular man in his fifties stepped forward. “Master, I primarily manage those affairs. Though personnel rotate over time, may I inquire about your concerns?”

“Concerns? I have nothing but concerns!” Master Qin snapped. “Are these the men who transported today’s goods?”

The indicated group—veterans responsible for routine deliveries between village and capital—shifted uneasily. Their route had always been secure and uneventful until this ominous summons.

“Indeed,” the bearded man confirmed. “These are trusted hands assigned to our most crucial trade.”

“Splendid,” Master Qin said coldly. “Let them recount today’s transport procedures—every step, without omission.”

One transporter stepped forward and bowed. “Master, after joint inspections with the village chief, we load fifty percent of catches into sealed crates. Upon the chief’s signed approval, we depart via the safest route—slightly longer but better preserving freshness. Upon reaching the capital, we first deliver a quarter of goods to the Black Gate Residence west district before proceeding to our fishpond. I’ve only managed this route for a month. Is there some irregularity?”

Master Qin and his son exchanged glances. The mention of Black Gate Residence—unknown to them—confirmed Qu Hua’s orchestration. Qin Huan pressed calmly, “Why visit this Black Gate Residence? I know nothing of such place.”

“Young Master, we merely followed Master Qu Hua’s orders. The reasons weren’t ours to question,” came the reply.

Father and son shared another meaningful look—the evidence now irrefutable. Qu Hua had systematically siphoned goods through this mysterious location. But where did the diverted shipments ultimately go?

Chapter 4898: Warning

Alone later, Qin Huan urged, “Father, shouldn’t we confront Qu Hua directly?”

“Of course,” Master Qin growled. “I’ll hear what excuses that viper offers.” Were it not for Madam Qin’s involvement, Qu Hua would already be dragged before them.

“But if we push too harshly and he refuses to name collaborators, our investigation hits dead ends,” Master Qin reasoned. To his mind, the timid Qu Hua lacked ambition for such schemes alone—someone powerful must be pulling strings. The true enemies were those shadowy recipients of diverted goods, likely rival families coveting Qin’s lucrative fisheries.

“Let’s capture Qu Hua and torture the truth from him!” Qin Huan suggested.

“No—we risk alarming his backers. This mastermind specifically targets our family. I’ll unearth them personally!” Master Qin declared. “Summon Qu Hua immediately—let him lose sleep as we have!”

Soon, armed guards stormed Qu Hua’s chambers, kicking down his door. The injured man nearly tumbled from bed in panic. “Wha—what’s this?”

“Master demands your presence,” a guard stated flatly. Ignoring Qu Hua’s protests about his injuries, they hauled him away, his agonized wails echoing through courtyards. Though physical pain racked him, greater terror gripped his heart—the day of reckoning had come too soon.

A quick-witted maid witnessed the commotion and dashed to alert Madam Qin. As the household stirred, curious servants gathered outside the main hall where Qu Hua now lay crumpled before the Qin patriarch.

“Aiya! You’re killing me!” Qu Hua howled theatrically until realizing no sympathy came. Struggling upright, he addressed his uncle with feigned innocence: “Uncle, Cousin—why this midnight summons?”

Master Qin’s voice dripped frost. “Raised in this household, shown every kindness by your aunt—is this how you repay us? What is Black Gate Residence?”

Qu Hua blanched but maintained pretense: “Black Gate Residence? Some delicacy?”

Qin Huan interjected coldly, “Speak truth, Qu Hua. Lies won’t save you now.”

The patriarch slammed account books before the trembling man. “These past months’ fishery records—do you take us for fools?!”

“I...I see no errors here,” Qu Hua stammered, desperately buying time until Madam Qin’s intervention.

Chapter 4899: Interrogation

As onlookers crowded the doorway, Master Qin’s anger crystallized into cold resolve. The family’s dirty laundry would air publicly tonight. “You grew up under our roof. Though I seldom disciplined you, your aunt doted on you endlessly. Is this your gratitude—stealing from your own kin?”

Qu Hua kowtowed, oily words flowing: “I’ve always been grateful! The Qin family is my second—”

“Enough!” Master Qin’s roar silenced the hall. “Who receives the goods at Black Gate Residence? Who guides your thievery?”

Sweat soaked Qu Hua’s robes. “I...I don’t know what you—”

The crack of a teacup shattering against stone punctuated the patriarch’s eruption: “Liar! Those accounts show systematic theft! Who else is involved? Name them!”

Qin Huan stepped closer, voice deadly quiet. “Cooperate, cousin. Or must we inquire with your associates at the docks? The ones smuggling goods after midnight?”

Qu Hua’s remaining color drained. They knew everything. As guards advanced, the broken man crumpled, words tumbling out in desperate torrent: “I’ll talk! It was the Chen family! They threatened my gambling debts! Forced me to divert shipments! The Black Gate Residence is their receiving point!”

A stunned murmur swept through the crowd. Master Qin’s knuckles whitened around his armrest. The Chen family—their oldest rivals—had struck at Qin’s lifeline. This war would escalate far beyond stolen fish.
