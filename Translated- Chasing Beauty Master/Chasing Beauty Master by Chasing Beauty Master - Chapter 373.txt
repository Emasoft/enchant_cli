“It seems I was correct. Well, then—unfortunately, it’s time for you to bid farewell to this world!”

Guan Yu’s gaze sharpened like blades, murderous intent flashing in his eyes.

Long Tian felt his body turn ice-cold from head to toe, as lifeless as a corpse.

After a flicker of hesitation, Long Tian’s expression suddenly hardened with resolve, tinged with tragic determination.

But at that moment, the killing intent in Guan Yu’s eyes vanished. A radiant, harmless smile reappeared on his face.

Guan Yu chuckled, “Of course, killing you isn’t strictly necessary.”

Long Tian froze, wondering if Guan Yu was deranged—his moods as unpredictable as a storm. One moment demanding death, the next offering life. Long Tian couldn’t fathom Guan Yu’s true intentions.

Yet Guan Yu gave him the impression of a wily old fox, poised to strike at any moment.

Wary, Long Tian steeled himself against potential treachery.

He stared at Guan Yu, waiting.

Guan Yu obliged, offering a condition for survival: “If you’re willing to become my mole, infiltrate the Haomen’s stronghold, uproot Li Yu (Master Yu), and replace him by erasing him from this world… what say you?”

Long Tian’s face cycled through shock, disbelief, and finally the look one gives a madman. He stammered, “Insane! You’re utterly mad! Impossible! I’d never agree! Wanting Master Yu dead? He’d make even your wish for death seem a luxury!”

To Long Tian, this scheme was beyond reckless—it was suicidal.

Using him as a mole to assassinate Li Yu from within?

A task more impossible than scaling heaven itself!

Moreover, Long Tian saw through Guan Yu’s true aim: to throw the Haomen into chaos by decapitating its leadership.

With the clan leaderless, they’d lack the capacity to pursue Guan Yu. A convenient escape route.

But was Long Tian a fool? Hardly!

Agreeing would brand him a traitor—a fate worse than death under Haomen’s brutal justice.

Hence his vehement refusal.

Guan Yu observed him calmly, that benign smile unwavering. “I know your fear—that I’ll discard you like a spent pawn.”

Long Tian sneered, “Isn’t that exactly your plan?”

Guan Yu shook his head gently. “Not at all. The capital is a delicious cake. I merely wish to claim my slice. How does that sound?”

If Long Tian had been shocked before, he was now thunderstruck.

He finally understood: Guan Yu didn’t just want Li Yu dead—he aimed to usurp his position.

A ambition far more audacious than mere assassination.

Sheer wolfish ambition!

Long Tian laughed coldly, “Aren’t you afraid of choking on your greed?”

“That’s none of your concern,” Guan Yu replied.

“Now answer—will you comply?”

“If you seek death, I won’t join your suicide!” Long Tian refused outright.

“Then die now,” Guan Yu stated impassively.

“If I die, you die with me!” Long Tian roared, face contorted.

***Chapter 937: Misfire?***

Madness glittered in Long Tian’s eyes as he raised a hand clutching a remote—no ordinary key fob, but one modified with a red detonator button.

All suspicious vehicles in the Haomen were retrofitted with such devices—emergency tools for destroying evidence and escaping amid chaos.

His thumb pressed hard on the button.

He’d resolved to die with Guan Yu—his final, meaningful service to the Haomen by eliminating this growing threat.

Long Tian laughed—a tragic, triumphant sound—then guffawed wildly.

Three enemies as death companions! A worthy trade!

Abruptly, his laughter died.

No explosion.

A dud?

Impossible! He’d pressed the button!

Frantic, he mashed the button repeatedly. Nothing. His car lay silent on its side.

Instead, Guan Yu’s Mercedes began blaring its alarm, annoying Li Xi into emerging.

“You wanted this,” Guan Yu held up a key fob. “The one you’re clutching is mine.”

Battle-hardened Guan Yu had long since evolved. During their confrontation, his detection system had read Long Tian’s every thought—including the car bomb.

Amid their struggle, Guan Yu had swapped their keys under cover of darkness and tension.

The button Long Tian desperately pressed merely triggered Guan Yu’s car alarm.

Staring at the key in Guan Yu’s hand, Long Tian’s face cycled through hues before settling on ashen gray. “Impossible! How?!”

He lunged madly for the detonator.

Guan Yu calmly kicked him down, leaving him coughing blood and convulsing.

“By refusing life, you forfeit usefulness. And the useless… get eliminated.”

Guan Yu hauled him up by the collar and tossed him toward his own car like trash before walking away.

Lin Dong wordlessly lit a cigarette and entered Guan Yu’s vehicle.

“Let’s go.”

As Guan Yu passed Li Xi, he moved to embrace her shoulders—only to be halted by her icy glare.

“What are you doing?”

His hand hovered awkwardly. “Night wind’s cold. Didn’t want you chilled.”

“Unnecessary.”

Li Xi entered the car, granting no opening.

Guan Yu glared at his own hand, muttering, “Should’ve just done it. Why chicken out now?”

He took the driver’s seat—Lin Dong having claimed the back—suspecting the man of ulterior motives.

Soon after their departure, an explosion lit the night, flames clawing at the darkness.

***

In the car, Guan Yu obsessively monitored Lin Dong via the rearview mirror—paranoid he might harass Li Xi.

His concern proved unwarranted. Lin Dong simply smoked by the window, gazing pensively into the night.

Relieved, Guan Yu turned away—

“Satisfied? Done peeking?” Lin Dong deadpanned.

The car swerved violently.

Damn, caught red-handed!

Li Xi’s piercing stare demanded explanation.

Flustered, Guan Yu shot Lin Dong a venomous look, met only with mocking disdain—a silent challenge.

Biting back rage (and knowing he couldn’t win a fight), Guan Yu changed tactics:

“Xiao Lin—the tape. Giving it to me or keeping it?”

***Chapter 938: Not Serious… But Deadly***

Guan Yu had to pivot—Lin Dong’s bluntness cornered him. Couldn’t let Li Xi think him jealous, especially with rumors reaching Mo Ling!

He shuddered at the domestic fallout.

“Xiao Lin! The tape! Want to keep it for… personal viewing?” Guan Yu leered, referencing the incriminating footage of Chen Lin and Li Jing’s indiscretions—key leverage against Chen Lin.

“Tape?” Lin Dong drawled. “Don’t have it.”

Guan Yu’s eye twitched. “What?! It was with you!”

“You told me to give it to him. It’s in his hands now.”

Guan Yu nearly choked. “You didn’t make a copy?! Were you too busy… ‘relieving yourself’ to it?!”

Lin Dong’s fist clenched, veins bulging.

Unheeding, Guan Yu ranted, “Xiao Lin! Needs must, but timing! Overusing your ‘five-fingered maiden’ harms your kidneys! Your future wife’s happi—”

CRASH!

The Mercedes screeched to a halt. Moments later, a certain someone tumbled onto the roadside.

Under the moonlit highway, Li Xi watched wide-eyed as Lin Dong administered a brutal beating.

When it ended, Lin Dong wordlessly resumed driving, leaving a battered Guan Yu to slink back into the car, grinding his teeth.

Just wait until my system upgrades…

Turning to Li Xi with puppy-dog eyes: “Xi’er, comfort me? Maybe a massage?”

Her verdict: “You reap what you sow.”

Defeated, Guan Yu flopped dramatically: “Lin Dong! My head… spinning… passing out!”

He “fainted” perfectly onto Li Xi’s lap—blissfully soft.

Smiling, he feigned sleep despite her attempts to shove him off.

Lin Dong watched, mentally noting: *Bold move… for a coward.*

Whether Guan Yu would retaliate if hearing this remained uncertain—the price of another beating might be too steep.
