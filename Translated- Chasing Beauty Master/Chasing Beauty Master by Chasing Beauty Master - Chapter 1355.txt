Guan Yu shook his head. "That's not the case. This matter involves creatures from the demon realm harming the village chief's family. Many years ago, the village chief's ancestor saved someone. Though well-intentioned, that person turned out to be a demonic entity. During the final battle against this creature, it released a virulent poison that took root in their bodies and multiplied."

"Originally, the village chief's lineage flourished with many male descendants. The inherited toxin remained dormant until affected children began being secretly eliminated. Over generations, the family declined. When the current village chief's only son became infected and transformed into a monster, the fifty-year-old patriarch couldn't bear to kill his sole heir. That's how this tragedy unfolded."

"When I slew the village chief's son, my heart ached. But the monster would have claimed more lives. Afterward, I realized the ancient tree was also tainted and resolved to destroy it. Though the villagers protested, they couldn't stop me. Just as we prepared to act, Ma Xiao from Front Return Peak arrived with Cloud Azure Sect members, soaring menacingly through the skies."

"Were they deliberately hunting you?" Siqi asked curiously. "That seems improbable."

"They were indeed sent by Uncle Lu," Guan Yu confirmed with a bitter smile. "When those villagers saw figures flying—something they considered divine—they prostrated themselves in worship. At the time, I knew nothing of cultivators and mistook them for immortals. With mere gestures, they captured me and my companions, taking us to Front Return Peak."

"Later, Uncle Lu explained the demonic tree was actually the Demon Realm's Tree of Life. The Cloud Azure Sect had erected barriers around the village to conceal it. Destroying it would unleash demonic energy and provoke war. Now I understand their intentions—protecting mortals by safeguarding this crucial artifact."

Chapter 3503: Memories of Homeland

Siqi nodded comprehension. "So you were mistaken as saboteurs? That's why Front Return Peak captured you?"

"Exactly," Guan Yu admitted. "My enrollment in Cloud Azure Sect became fate's whim. Who'd imagine I'd become one of them?"

"Did you only discover your dual cultivation talent after joining?"

"Correct. After Uncle Lu noticed my unusual constitution and Master Xuanming confirmed it, both took me under their wing."

Siqi gazed at him admiringly. "Rightfully so! A dual cultivator emerges perhaps once a millennium. Even my master envies you."

"Thus I stumbled into learning mystic arts. Quite serendipitous, no?" Guan Yu chuckled, recalling their first meeting when Siqi had detained him as a suspect. Now they collaborated on sect missions—life's unpredictability.

"You're fortunate Uncle Lu found you. Such talent shouldn't be wasted," Siqi praised sincerely.

"Enough flattery—it'll inflate my ego." Guan Yu covered his face in mock embarrassment.

"Tell me of your homeland," Siqi pressed. "What's it like?"

"Vastly different and distant," Guan Yu began. "A technologically advanced realm with vehicles called cars and aircraft. Though mostly ordinary people, some practitioners exist—nothing like our cultivators."

"Fascinating! Could you take me there someday?"

"Certainly." Guan Yu smiled, noting her uncharacteristic enthusiasm. The usually aloof maiden now brimmed with curiosity—perhaps genuine interest in him. "When I return, you'll accompany me."

Chapter 3504: Outmatched

As dusk approached, Guan Yu explained their predicament: "Tonight, Steward Sun leads demonic cultivators through the rockery entrance. With thirty-two adversaries including Fox Demon and Left Envoy, we're hopelessly outnumbered."

Xiao Zhi barged in with Aze. "Aren't we gathering? Why linger here?"

Guan Yu reiterated the dangers. Xiao Zhi paled. "If battle erupts here, my uncle's household—"

"Multiple entrances exist," Guan Yu reassured. "The true conflict will occur within Duobao Mountain. Our best course: let them trigger traps first."

"Shouldn't we inform Madam Qin?" Aze worried.

Guan Yu shook his head. "Only demonic factions know this entrance. The main assault will occur elsewhere."

Contacting Elder Zheng via communication treasure, they received stern orders: "Seize the Eight-Sided Drum technique before demons!"

"How?" Xiao Zhi protested. "Against Left Envoy and Fox Demon?"

Elder Zheng remained adamant. "The sect's reputation depends on this!"

Chapter 3505: No Solutions

Guan Yu argued pragmatically: "Other sects sent dozens. We're four against armies! Our masters never intended success—this is mere posturing."

Siqi wavered between duty and survival. "But failure brings punishment..."

"Let fools court death," Guan Yu scoffed. "I won't throw away my life."

As they debated, sudden realization struck—Guan Yu's cultivation stagnation might stem from his mental seal. Though功德鼎's energy transfer had boosted his reserves, progress remained elusive. While others gained skills, he'd nearly died from backlash.

Noticing his distraction, Siqi asked, "What troubles you?"

"Anticipating tonight's events." Guan Yu gestured westward. "Darkness falls. Steward Sun's group will emerge soon."

Xiao Zhi proposed alerting authorities, but Guan Yu vetoed: "The rockery entrance remains secret. Exposure risks collateral damage."

Resigned, the group prepared to observe covertly. With enemies vastly superior, direct confrontation promised annihilation. Their only hope lay in the mountain's deadly mechanisms thinning demonic ranks first—a precarious gamble with the sect's prestige at stake.
