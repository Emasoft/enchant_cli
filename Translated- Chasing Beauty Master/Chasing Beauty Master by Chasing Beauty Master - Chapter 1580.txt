Guan Yu shook his head and said, “No, it’s not like that. There’s something you might not know. I lost both parents long ago. My two elder sisters have been taking care of me ever since. They’ve been like mothers to me, always putting my needs first. That’s why only they would fuss over my marital affairs.”

“So that’s how it is,” Wang Xiaorong exclaimed with exaggerated sympathy. “You’re an orphan without parents, Guan Yu? Oh, my poor dear!” Her face brimmed with theatrical pity, though her eyes sparkled with mischief.

**Chapter 4097: The Joy of Helping Others**

“It doesn’t matter anymore. I’ve grown accustomed to it,” Guan Yu replied cheerfully. “You should know my sisters are extraordinary women—wealthy beyond measure, what locals would call pillars of prosperity. When you meet them, they’ll adore you.”

“Wonderful! I can’t wait to meet them!” Wang Xiaorong clapped her hands, then sobered. “But let’s focus on breaking your seal first.”

Guan Yu nodded, pleased by her pragmatism. Yet his mind wandered to future complications—the chasm between their worlds, his dual obligations to the Cloud Azure Sect and this spirited princess. How would they bridge such divides?

He also dreaded explaining the women of Qiaoyuan District to Wang Xiaorong. While polygamy was customary here, her fiery temper promised storms. Worse, if his other lovers discovered his... extracurricular gallantry, retribution would be swift and merciless.

“Guan Yu, look—what’s that crowd up ahead?” Wang Xiaorong pointed toward a bustling intersection. Dozens clustered near a corner, murmuring and gesturing at something unseen.

“Let’s investigate, but stay alert,” he cautioned. Though disguised, vigilance remained vital. Guan Yu’s instincts prickled—someone was tailing them. He’d bide his time before shaking the shadow loose.

Pushing through the throng, they found a pregnant woman collapsed in a pool of blood, her face ashen. “Heavens! Lao Cang, do something!” Wang Xiaorong gripped his arm. “She’s dying!”

(“Lao Cang” was Guan Yu’s alias for their outing.) The crowd buzzed with helpless anxiety. No midwives stepped forward, and Guan Yu—a man—could hardly assist directly.

“Does anyone here have children?” he barked at a wary matron clutching a vegetable basket. When she recoiled, he pressed, “Help her! I’ll guide you.”

The woman relented, and Guan Yu orchestrated the emergency delivery like a battlefield commander. “Hot water! Deep breaths—push now!” Minutes later, a squalling, blood-smeared boy emerged. Cheers erupted as mother and child stabilized.

Wang Xiaorong wept joyful tears, gazing at Guan Yu with starry-eyed adoration. Her heart swelled—here was a man who conquered every challenge, worthy of her devotion.

Guan Yu draped his coat over the exhausted mother. “Rest. The physician’s coming.” He tossed a silver ingot to onlookers. “Who’ll escort them to the clinic?” Volunteers materialized instantly, greed outpacing compassion.

As the cart rattled away, the woman whispered thanks. Guan Yu waved it off. “Fate brought us here. We’ll meet again if destiny wills it.”

“Your name, benefactor?” she implored.

Wang Xiaorong interjected, “Call him Lao Cang.” Guan Yu shot her an amused glance—their disguises made identities irrelevant.

**Chapter 4098: Questionable Character**

“That woman fancied you,” Wang Xiaorong teased as they walked.

“Nonsense. Gratitude, not affection.”

“Hmph. Had you ignored her, I’d reconsider your worth.” She grinned, looping her arm through his. “But you’re perfect—my hero.”

“Still auditioning for your approval, am I?” he mock-groused.

Their banter carried them through vibrant streets until Wang Xiaorong sniffed disdainfully at their lodgings. “Prince Zou’s chosen a wretched inn—cheapskate.”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Quiet locations deter assassins. Though yes, his frugality with horses was... notable.”

They paused before a bustling eatery—Braised Meat Pancake. The aroma triggered Guan Yu’s nostalgia; this dish had thrived in his homeland for millennia.

“Let’s feast!” Wang Xiaorong declared.

**Chapter 4099: Shadowed**

Inside, steam and chatter thickened the air. As they queued, Guan Yu stiffened. “Wait here.”

He slipped into an alley, then doubled back—just in time to spot a shadowy figure in a bamboo hat retreating. The stalker melted into the lunch crowd as Guan Yu rejoined Wang Xiaorong.

“Our turn soon,” she said, oblivious. “I’ll order extra pancakes.”

Guan Yu nodded, eyes scanning the room. The watcher lingered near the door—but for now, hot food took priority.
