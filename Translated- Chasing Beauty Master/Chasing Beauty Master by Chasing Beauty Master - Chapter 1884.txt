“You ask a good question. In truth, I obtained it atop Swordless Mountain,” Guan Yu said. “At the time, I sought to challenge the Swordless Immortal at Swordless Manor but failed. Later, I discovered a cave on the mountain where I found this.”

“When I first found it, I merely thought it a beautiful treasure pearl. I didn’t know it was the East Sea Dragon Pearl, nor had I ever heard of such a thing. It wasn’t until I gifted it to Princess Jiang Xin during the Classical Sect rankings that I learned its true nature. I hope the Left Envoy understands my explanation.”

“Knowing it was such a priceless treasure, you still insisted on giving it away?” the Left Envoy remarked. “Guan Yu, in my memory, you’ve never been a fool.”

“Though I am no man of noble status, I keep my word,” Guan Yu replied. “The Left Envoy has never regretted his choices. If you wish to learn more about the East Sea Dragon Pearl from me, you’ll have to inquire slowly through the jianghu. Even if you seek out Jiang Yuan Kai, it’ll be useless—he knows little and is already dispatching more men to investigate.”

The Left Envoy found himself at an impasse. Wang Xiaorong, the Young Mistress he dared not offend, directly hindered his plans. Were this anyone but Guan Yu, the Left Envoy would have long seized them and dragged them back to the Demon Soul Sect for interrogation. Yet under these circumstances, such actions were clearly impossible.

Since Guan Yu claimed ignorance, the Left Envoy relented. After all, the East Sea Dragon Pearl had only recently emerged, and many matters still required gradual investigation.

“It’s not that our Demon Soul Sect holds particular interest in the East Sea’s treasures,” the Left Envoy said. “The news has already spread to all major sects. None of the immortal cultivation factions—including the Cloud Azure Sect—will let this slip by easily. You’ll receive word of it soon enough.”

He then turned to Wang Xiaorong. “Young Mistress, if there’s nothing else, I shall take my leave.” With that, he departed as swiftly and silently as ever.

After great effort and exhaustive persuasion, Guan Yu finally managed to placate Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi. He then made his way alone to the Prince Consort’s residence.

Jiang Yuan Kai had long been waiting. A soldier escorted Guan Yu inside, where Jiang Yuan Kai greeted him warmly. “Welcome, Brother Wan Hong!”

“Brother Jiang sent word of a prepared feast. How could I delay?” Guan Yu replied with a smile.

“Please, come in.” Inside, a lavish table laden with delicacies awaited—far more sumptuous than the previous banquet at the Wanyang Tavern. Guan Yu mused that this explained Qiqi’s insistence on accompanying him.

As Guan Yu surveyed the spread, Jiang Yuan Kai asked, “Brother Wan Hong, why didn’t you bring your two beloved companions? I’ve prepared many delicacies for them.”

Guan Yu answered plainly, “They intended to come, but I assumed Brother Jiang wished to discuss matters best suited for men. Affairs between gentlemen need not involve women.”

“Hah! Brother Wan Hong has admirable resolve,” Jiang Yuan Kai laughed. “Next time, you must bring them. Consider this place your home—no need for formality.”

“I’ve also heard Brother Wan Hong particularly favors the aged Daughter Red wine from Wanyang Tavern.” Jiang Yuan Kai produced a jar—indeed, the renowned vintage.

“Brother Jiang’s thoughtfulness touches me,” Guan Yu said. “With such a feast, I’ll indulge without restraint.”

“I admire your forthright character! Let us share a toast first.”

As they drank and conversed, Guan Yu inquired, “Brother Jiang, are Her Highness and Lady Jiang still at the palace? How fares Lady Jiang’s recovery?”

“Ah, it’s all due to the East Sea Dragon Pearl affair,” Jiang Yuan Kai sighed. “Her Highness insists the palace is safer, refusing to return. Xin’er has fully recovered—no lingering effects. Initially, Her Highness worried the ordeal might leave psychological scars, but Xin’er remains lively as ever.”

“That’s excellent news,” Guan Yu said. “Surviving such calamity surely heralds future blessings. In truth, their stay at the palace seems prudent—the East Sea Dragon Pearl brings too much trouble.”

“I regret ever retrieving that accursed object and gifting it to Lady Jiang. Without it, none of this would have happened.”

“Don’t blame yourself,” Jiang Yuan Kai countered. “This follows the logic of ‘men die for wealth.’ Troubles indeed multiply—this morning alone, while I was absent, jianghu figures came seeking me, undoubtedly about the Dragon Pearl.”

“The news has spread throughout the jianghu,” Guan Yu noted. “Even cultivation sects know. None would pass up the East Sea’s nation-rivaling treasures. My sources confirm the Demon Soul Sect has already begun meddling.”

“A true nuisance. With this pearl, peace remains elusive.” Jiang Yuan Kai drank deeply. “Despite dispatching numerous agents, we’ve found no clues. The events span too many years—we can’t even locate what was once called the East Sea.”

**Chapter 4952: Wrong Direction**

Success would never come easily. With current troubles mounting, Her Highness’s decision proved wise—the palace offered far greater security.

“I’ve settled the matter you requested,” Jiang Yuan Kai said. “Her Highness confirmed the Cao family’s duty belongs solely to the Crown Prince. She intends to petition His Majesty and remains convinced the Crown Prince saved Xin’er, holding him in deepest gratitude.”

“My thanks, Brother Jiang.” Guan Yu clasped his hands.

Though a simple favor for Jiang Yuan Kai, both knew mishandling could draw Her Highness into court intrigues—an outcome neither desired.

“With all your dispatched agents, has nothing been uncovered about the Dragon Pearl?” Guan Yu pressed.

Jiang Yuan Kai shook his head. “Nothing. I even sought information about the legendary Qiao Beauty—still nothing.”

Guan Yu frowned. Though the Dragon Pearl’s history spanned decades, complete absence of clues seemed improbable. “Brother Jiang, could your methods or direction be mistaken? If the Qiao Beauty possessed it thirty years ago, surely traces remain.”

“You oversimplify,” Jiang Yuan Kai replied. “Thirty years prior, the East Sea’s treasures were rumors spread by demonic creatures. Before that, none knew of them. Tracking this now proves too difficult.”

Legends claimed Qiao Beauty, lover of former martial alliance leader Dai Xiaotian, was actually a princess of the East Sea. After her realm violated taboos and dried through warfare, she wandered the human world. Yet none could verify these tales. Before becoming Dai Xiaotian’s consort, none knew her origins—only that she was an extraordinary cultivator of indeterminate age.

“True,” Guan Yu conceded. “A cultivator’s age defies appearance—she might be centuries old. But if even Dai Xiaotian left no records, perhaps we should focus on locating the East Sea itself. The treasure lies there—finding its approximate location would clarify everything.”

Jiang Yuan Kai nodded. “You’re right. I’ve been obsessing over the pearl’s secrets, complicating matters. We must first pinpoint the East Sea’s location—only then can we seek the treasure.”

Guan Yu theorized the Dragon Pearl served as a key or guide to the treasure. But without knowing the East Sea’s whereabouts, such speculations remained premature.

“Once you redirect efforts to locate the East Sea, progress will follow,” Guan Yu advised.

“Agreed. Your insight saves me from continued errors.” Jiang Yuan Kai raised his cup. “To our partnership!”

As they dined, Jiang Yuan Kai proposed, “Brother, with recent troubles multiplying, I’ve a request. Join me in searching for the East Sea’s treasures. With your help, we’ll find them swiftly, avoiding prolonged dangers.”

Guan Yu had anticipated this. “Truthfully, I’ve little interest. Yet this morning, my sect ordered me to investigate the treasure. This aligns perfectly—let us collaborate. The Cloud Azure Sect’s involvement pleases me.”

Though reluctant, Guan Yu recognized his debt to Jiang Yuan Kai. Refusal would be discourteous. Moreover, with the Demon Soul Sect involved, his sect would likely command participation regardless.

“Very well,” Guan Yu agreed. “Having declined your invitations before, I can’t refuse again.”

“Splendid!” Jiang Yuan Kai beamed. “With your abilities, success is assured. Our priority remains locating the East Sea. Once found, we plan accordingly.”

Guan Yu nodded. Given the widespread rumors, he expected Cloud Azure envoys soon.

**Chapter 4953: Following Orders**

Prince Zou departed the capital with disaster relief funds. In court, the Emperor declared, “The Cao family’s collusion in Lady Jiang’s kidnapping merits severe punishment.”

The Crown Prince stepped forward. “Imperial Father, I’ve thorough knowledge of this case. Grant me authority to adjudicate Cao Patriarch and Cao Di.”

“Since when does the Crown Prince dabble in jurisprudence?” the Second Prince interjected. “This matter belongs with the Imperial Guards. Why trouble yourself?”

The Emperor observed silently, noting the Crown Prince’s retort: “Are you suggesting only Imperial Guards may handle cases? They’ve been uninvolved from the start—even the Elite Guard would be preferable.”

Eyeing the longevity-bestowing white gemstone from the Second Prince, the Emperor compromised: “The Cao case involves far-reaching implications. Both princes shall submit investigative plans. I’ll appoint the most competent.”

At the Second Prince’s estate, Minister Qi faced reproach. “Why haven’t you silenced Cao Patriarch? The Emperor seeks to uncover all conspirators—we’re at risk!”

“The prison is heavily guarded,” Minister Qi explained. “Hasty action would alert them. We await the proper moment.”

“Find that moment swiftly,” the Second Prince snapped. “Before interrogation begins, Cao must die—or the Qin family falls.”
