With strength exceeding ten thousand pounds, even if he couldn’t win, surely he could escape? Yet the surrounding space seemed frozen. Mu Yun felt as if he had been cast in concrete, forced to maintain his current posture, helplessly watching Guan Yu slowly approach. A golden-glowing fist descended toward his head.

“You’re not human! No ordinary person could possess such power…” Mu Yun shouted, but a gust of fist wind silenced the latter half of his words.

***Boom!***
A deafening crash—three times louder than Mu Yun’s earlier strike against Guan Yu—erupted, shaking the stadium stands. Mu Yun’s legs buckled as Guan Yu’s punch drove him knee-deep into the ground.

“Impressive resilience! My strike didn’t break your legs. Remarkable! Let’s test three more punches.” Like a child playfully hammering a stake, Guan Yu grinned and delivered three consecutive blows.

Though Mu Yun’s body showed no external injuries, bright red blood now trickled from his lips, leaving him no chance to cry out.

***Thud! Thud! Thud!***
Three more earth-shaking strikes landed precisely on Mu Yun’s head, burying his entire body in the soil, leaving only his head exposed.

Mu Yun’s features contorted from the force. Three mouthfuls of blood sprayed onto the track, and a three-inch lump swelled atop his skull—all four punches had struck the same spot.

Guan Yu crouched lightly, patting Mu Yun’s head. “Truly tough. Not even a scratch. Worthy of a mutant.”

Since his mutation, Mu Yun had never suffered such humiliation. Yet facing Guan Yu, he felt only profound terror, devoid of resentment.

Human nature scorns the inferior, envies peers, and cowers before the insurmountable. If Mu Yun had arrived confident in subduing Guan Yu, he now understood: Guan Yu could kill him with a finger.

Suddenly, police sirens wailed outside the stadium. The explosive clash had drawn attention.

Though modern police posed no threat to Guan Yu, he preferred anonymity. Unlike power-hungry villains, he sought to protect his loved ones and homeland. This was why he spared Mu Yun—to recruit mutants like him as guardians of Huaxia.

Mu Yun, a former convict, had evaded reincarceration post-mutation. Yet to his shock, Guan Yu—whose power dwarfed his own—flinched at the sirens, seized him, and soared skyward.

As wind roared past and the stadium shrank hundreds of meters below, even as a mutant, Mu Yun gasped, “Are you… Superman?”

“Superman?” Guan Yu chuckled. “No. I’m no Superman.”

**Chapter 1656: Subjugation**

Streaking through the air, Guan Yu flew a dozen miles to a hilltop under the moon’s silvery glow. He dropped Mu Yun, who collapsed, internally ravaged by four punches.

Under moonlight, Guan Yu loomed like a deity in Mu Yun’s eyes—not in form, but in shattered perception. Once arrogantly unassailable, Mu Yun now saw himself as a mere punching bag against this seemingly harmless youth.

Flight—a power beyond human or mutant ken—terrified him. Moreover, Guan Yu lacked the telltale aura of mutation. Mutants channeled borrowed divine energy; Guan Yu’s strength was innate.

“If not Superman… you must be an immortal from Huaxia’s myths!” Mu Yun struggled to kneel. “Immortal! Punish this unworthy one!”

Guan Yu nearly laughed. This educated criminal now groveled to a “deity”? Unbeknownst to him, two decades of global “miracles” had eroded atheism. Mutants were deemed divinely chosen, above mortal law.

Seizing the moment, Guan Yu waved a hand. Clouds veiled the moon, and drizzle fell.

Mu Yun kowtowed frantically. “Forgive my blindness, Immortal!”

“If I wished you dead, you’d be gone.” Guan Yu’s voice brooked no dissent. “Call me Guan Yu. You know that name.”

Mu Yun recoiled. “The Guan Yu who entered the Divine Relic twenty years ago?!”

Few civilians knew the name, but relic survivors revered it. Mu Yun cursed his ignorance—had he known, he’d never have attacked.

“No one escapes the relics! How?!”

Guan Yu smirked. “Drop the schemes. I read your thoughts like glass. Serve me faithfully, or die.”

Infusing his words with psychic authority, Guan Yu radiated divine might. Mu Yun prostrated, trembling. “I… I am your hound! No disobedience!”

Wasting no time, Guan Yu implanted a mental command and flew them back, dumping Mu Yun in an alley before returning to Liu Shilei’s residence.

**Chapter 1657: Bu Shiren**

The next morning, Sun Xiaoya avoided eye contact throughout her class. Despite Guan Yu’s teasing glances, she refused engagement.

Though his prior treatment had only mildly improved her mother’s condition, Sun Xiaoya neither invited him back nor requested further help. Guan Yu admired her filial piety—a virtue he prized—and her dedication to students.

After class, Guan Yu intercepted her at the door. “Teacher Sun, I didn’t understand a problem.”

Laughter erupted. In this school of privileged slackers, academic questions were unheard of. Whistles and chants of “Get together!” followed them.

In the office, Sun Xiaoya slammed her textbooks. “Oh mighty one, what does a mortal do for you?”

Her angry posture accentuated her curves. Guan Yu’s gaze lingered until she snapped, “Little pervert! How dare you leer!”

Before he could reply, the door burst open. A hulking figure stormed in, hand raised to strike. “Xiaoya! Is this brat harassing you?!”

Guan Yu sensed it—a pseudo-mutant aura.

“Bu Shiren!” Sun Xiaoya barked. “This is my student. I’ll handle it!”
