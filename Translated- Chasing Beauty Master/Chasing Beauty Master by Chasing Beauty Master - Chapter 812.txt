“Doing this, are you worthy of your parents?” Guan Yu’s icy words froze everyone in their tracks.

Yaoji, witnessing this, traced circles on Guan Yu’s chest with her delicate fingers and cooed, “Boss Guan, you live like an emperor with a harem of beauties at home. But have pity on these lonely bachelor classmates and the girls who’ve repressed their needs for so long. Shouldn’t we all honor our youth to truly live?”

Guan Yu had to admit Yaoji’s silver tongue wielded logic. Many male students remained single, while female classmates harbored repressed desires, too shy to express themselves except in such settings.

“Your arguments hold merit,” Guan Yu countered, “but this shouldn’t occur on campus. It’s illegal.”

“As adults, why is it illegal here? We’re all willing participants. We don’t force tips—our service is free. Can’t I be intimate with my boyfriend? If every client becomes my boyfriend temporarily, is that unlawful?” Yaoji’s glib rationale explained why so many girls had been persuaded into this trade.

“Free? Such altruism?” Guan Yu scoffed.

“Of course. Though if men wish to tip for good service, we’ll graciously accept.”

Unbeknownst to Guan Yu, the pricing structure divided rooms: even-numbered rooms cost 500 yuan hourly with companions, while odd-numbered rooms charged 100 yuan without. Yaoji’s “free service” simply masked inflated room fees.

Resigned, Guan Yu recognized this as their livelihood strategy. Opposing it would alienate the entire male student body—a public enemy role he refused.

Though tempted by the fresh-faced girls, Guan Yu’s principles held firm. Disinterested in emotionless encounters, he stood abruptly. “We’re leaving.”

The declaration nearly made Wei Hongwei in the corner wet himself, interrupting his heated prelude.

Surveying the flushed pair, Guan Yu shook his head helplessly—no man could resist such temptations.

Departing alone, Yaoji’s earlier words resonated: while he enjoyed multiple lovers, lonely students craved connection. As he turned to leave, Yaoji lunged, grasping his arm.

Intrigued by his immunity to her girls’ charms, Yaoji doubled her efforts. “Boss Guan, stay! If these sisters don’t suit you, I’ll fetch others!” She pushed him onto a couch, signaling more girls to swarm.

‘I refuse to believe you’re heartless,’ Yaoji thought, determined to compromise Guan Yu. His surrender would ridicule both him and the Yu Gang faction.

With two girls straddling his legs, Guan Yu roared, “Enough! Cease this farce!” His disappointment scattered the group. Wei Hongwei, startled into premature climax, gaped as Guan Yu disentangled himself and stormed out.

“Boss Guan, are you a eunuch?” Yaoji’s taunt burned his pride. “Ridiculous! Could a eunuch sustain so many beauties? Save your provocations—they’re wasted on me.”

Exiting campus, Guan Yu grappled with whether to intervene. Wei Hongwei’s actions warranted discretion—he’d advise the boy privately to cherish Yaoyao.

The “eunuch” insult festered as Guan Yu sped home. Bathing failed to cleanse Yaoji’s words: “Boss Guan, are you a eunuch?” The barb haunted him.

“Damn witch, I’ll make you pay,” he muttered, finding the house empty—the girls doubtless gaming in Zhang Han’s room.

Bursting in, he saw four figures engrossed in screens. Only Amei acknowledged him: “You’re back, Guan Yu,” before resuming play.

Recalling Yaoji’s jeers, Guan Yu slammed the door. In furious retaliation, he hurled all four onto Zhang Han’s bed…

**Chapter 2060: No Compensation**

Qian Yunqing’s vandalized internet café was clearly Feng Jiawei’s doing. Impatient by nature, Qian refused to acknowledge Ma Hai’s supposed protection over Feng at Century Garden Academy.

Confronting Feng in the cafeteria, Qian demanded, “Let’s settle accounts. The damages are substantial.”

Dismissing police involvement due to Feng’s connections, Qian opted for direct action—compensation or punishment.

“It was just some old computers,” Feng shrugged between bites. “I got angry gaming and smashed a few.”

Wu Chumei seethed at his nonchalance. The entire café had been trashed.

“Each computer costs 5,000 yuan. Forty-nine damaged. Ten days’ lost revenue at 1,000 daily. I’ll waive that—just pay 50,000 yuan.” Qian’s tone brooked no argument.

Feng gaped. “You’re nickel-and-diming me? After years as classmates?”

“You leech off your family. I need this money. Pay or suffer consequences.”

Cornered, Feng realized Ma Hai and Li Yuan’s scheme backfired. Lacking funds but fearing Qian’s martial prowess, he stalled: “Give me three days.”

“Three days, or hospitalize yourself with that money,” Qian growled, dragging Wu Chumei away—her heart fluttering at their first handhold.

**Chapter 2061: Changing Tastes**

Wu Chumei’s unwavering devotion to Qian Yunqing was legendary. While other girls courted his sister Yaoyao for access, she alone earned the sister’s approval as future sister-in-law.

Feng Jiawei, nursing frustrated lust for Wu, vowed: “I’ll have you before Qian does—by force if necessary.”

Meanwhile, Li Yuan dismissed Feng’s panic over the 50,000 yuan debt. “Meet me tomorrow for the money. Pathetic—letting Qian intimidate you.”

At a restaurant, Wang Ting berated Cao Jin: “I warned against confronting Guan Yu directly. Now half your men are hospitalized with massive compensation!”

“I’ll destroy him, even if we perish together!” Cao Jin crushed his cigarette.

“Fool. Use strategy, not brute force.” As Wang Ting left, she hinted: “Try the Imperial Café’s new attractions…”

The next night at Mac’s Bar, Li Yuan mocked Feng: “Broke despite your connections?” Promising funds, he lured Feng to the Imperial Café’s fourth-floor den.

Yaoji greeted them with swaying hips. “Brother Li, craving new flavors tonight?”

“Sister Yaoji,” Li Yuan grinned, “what if I want you?”
