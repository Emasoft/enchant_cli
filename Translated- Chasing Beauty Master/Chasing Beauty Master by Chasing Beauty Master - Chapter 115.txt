Now he had gained a little tagalong. Guan Yu mused quietly to himself. Du Xiaojuan's clinginess only manifested during leisure times, but this Zhao Jing'er would likely stick to him constantly – attending classes together and even living under the same roof after school.

Yet Guan Yu found no reason to dislike this arrangement. After all, Zhao Jing'er's sickly delicate appearance and exquisite features made simply gazing at her a pleasure. Her pale, lovely face seemed bathed in holy light under the moonlight filtering through the hospital window, creating an ethereal yet palpably real vision that calmed his turbulent thoughts.

After administering her nightly treatment, Guan Yu lay on the adjacent caretaker's bed. He watched her breathing gradually steady into sleep before stealthily rising. Retrieving a prepared pin from beneath his pillow, he crouched before the wall socket.

His experiment began – would his mutated ability absorb standard 220V household current as it had the stun gun's charge? As the pin slid into the socket, his entire body stiffened. Electricity surged through his right arm as the ancient coin in his mind spontaneously activated, spinning furiously while blue currents swirled around it like silken cocoons.

Though spared from electrocution pain, Guan Yu felt disturbing numbness spreading through his limb. When the discomfort intensified, he yanked the pin free. The coin continued circulating arcs of energy through his system, reshaping him along an unknown path. Flexing his fist, he marveled at the explosive power now coursing through his muscles – a force threatening to burst forth uncontrollably.

"Don't turn into some monster now," he muttered wryly before surrendering to sleep beneath the coin's ceaseless modifications.

Dawn revealed Zhao Jing'er propped on one elbow, studying him intently. "Brother, you're awake?" she chimed sweetly.

"Why not sleep more? It's only 5:30."

"Lying here all day leaves me restless," she demurred, though truthfully, her first night away from home's sheltered confines had been fraught with excitement and anxiety about the outside world.

As Guan Yu performed his Bone-Breaking Fist drills by the window, Zhao Jing'er watched curiously. "What's that exercise?"

"Just calisthenics," he deflected.

She nodded like a pecking chick. "I thought it looked too clumsy for martial arts!"

Guan Yu chuckled inwardly. Modern televised "martial arts" prioritized flashy aesthetics over combat efficacy. True fighting required simplicity – a lesson reinforced by military combat systems' brutal efficiency. Each compact three-strike combination he practiced aimed for maximum impact without theatrical flourishes.

After breakfast preparations, Patriarch Zhao arrived, bittersweetly overseeing his granddaughter's discharge. "Take good care of my jewel," the old man entreated, his tone suggesting a deeper entrustment as the car departed for N City.

Zhao Jing'er's childlike wonder at passing scenery forced a slow journey until Guan Yu persuaded her to close the window. By noon, they arrived at his villa where Feng Xin and Du Xiaojuan awaited.

"Where have you been?" Du Xiaojuan tearfully embraced him while Feng Xin shot icy glances. Introducing Zhao Jing'er as his "adopted sister and patient" did little to dispel the tense atmosphere until the frail girl explained Guan Yu's life-saving intervention.

"...Brother risked everything to cure me," she concluded softly, melting the women's hostility.

Feng Xin's demeanor shifted upon learning Zhao Jing'er's influential background had resolved their recent crisis. "Welcome, little sister. Let us know if this rascal bothers you," she said, suddenly maternal.

As Du Xiaojuan led Zhao Jing'er upstairs, Guan Yu cornered Feng Xin. "How exactly will you 'punish' me, Sister Xin?" he teased, relishing her uncharacteristic fluster.

Her cheeks flushed crimson beneath his proximity. "I... I was just speaking idly!"

"Your blushing face is quite charming," he whispered, reveling in reducing the gang leader to a bashful maiden before releasing her to compose herself.

Thus began Zhao Jing'er's integration into their unconventional household – a delicate blossom sheltered by Guan Yu's growing circle, her presence adding new complexities to their tangled dynamics.
