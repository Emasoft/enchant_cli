Duan Ruxue no longer wished to remain amidst these affairs. Her feelings toward Wan Hong remained complex and ineffable, making this oppressive atmosphere all the more intolerable.

“It grows late, and I’ve matters to attend to,” Duan Ruxue declared. “Since Young Master Wan Hong requires no assistance here, I shall take my leave.”

The subsequent events were predictable enough, and she saw no reason to linger.

“Farewell, Eldest Miss Duan. Let us gather again when time permits,” Guan Yu remarked impassively.

Jiang Xin added, “Ruxue, visit me sometime. Don’t sequester yourself at home forever.”

Nodding, Duan Ruxue departed with her two maids in tow. Chu Fan’s anxiety mounted. Ever since Guan Yu struck Cao Di and provoked the Cao family, the Red Charm Theater had suffered greatly. Now, with Guan Yu’s woman assaulting Qu Hua and incurring the Qin family’s wrath, the repercussions remained uncertain. Chu Fan prayed this new conflict wouldn’t again engulf the theater. The Cao family’s previous machinations had left many injured—including Chu Fan himself, who still bore foot injuries. Since encountering Wan Hong, tranquility had become a distant memory. What fresh turmoil awaited?

“Heavens! Young Master Qu Hua is Madam Qin’s most doted-upon son! Will this prove fatal?” a bystander exclaimed.

Qiqi’s vicious kick had left Qu Hua writhing on the ground, trembling uncontrollably. When Mei Jie—the enigmatic manager of Wanyang Tavern—emerged, Guan Yu studied her with narrowed eyes. He still couldn’t discern whether this figure who refused allegiance to any faction was friend or foe, though her neutrality commanded reluctant admiration.

In this city where cultivating powerful connections proved essential, Guan Yu had recently discovered Mei Jie’s secret during a close encounter: beneath the cosmetics and feminine attire lay a biological man. Such gender transformations weren’t uncommon in the Central Plains—Wang Jun, among others, exemplified this.

“Who dares cause trouble here?” Mei Jie demanded, having been briefed about Qu Hua accosting a young lady accompanied by Wan Hong and Miss Jiang. The scene confirmed expectations: Cao Di and Qu Hua, perennial troublemakers who usually escaped consequences due to their statuses.

But since Wan Hong’s arrival, the balance had shifted. After Cao Di’s beating and now Qu Hua’s humiliation, Madam Qin’s retaliation seemed inevitable.

“Explain this! What transpired with Young Master Qu Hua?” Mei Jie circled the moaning figure.

**Chapter 4871: Different Temperaments**

The Imperial Consort’s estate overshadowed even the Four Great Families in influence, making Mei Jie’s partiality toward them understandable. Would Jiang Yuan Kai intervene for Wan Hong against the Qins? The crowd awaited the answer.

Guan Yu harbored no doubts. His martial prowess could repel any Qin enforcers. If pressed, he’d simply assume new identities while remaining in the capital—or teach the Qins a brutal lesson if provoked beyond endurance.

“Young Master Wan Hong’s mettle impresses, but I’ve affairs to manage indoors.” With that curt dismissal, Mei Jie withdrew.

Servants helped Qu Hua to a chair. “We’ve notified your family, Young Master. Rest here momentarily,” one said before hastily retreating.

Qu Hua’s tear-blurred vision fixed on Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi. The sight reignited his agony, reducing him to humiliating sobs—a grown man weeping like an infant. The searing pain below suggested severe swelling.

Through slit eyes, he glared at the man embraced by beauties. Though unfamiliar, the presence of Jiang Xin and Chu Fan confirmed this was Wan Hong—the recent capital sensation. That these women belonged to him! That they dared strike first!

“After my family arrives,” Qu Hua vowed through gritted teeth, “I’ll trample Wan Hong to death. Then those bitches will scream beneath me until their last breath!”

Guan Yu averted his gaze, restraining his temper for Jiang Xin’s sake.

“We’ve eaten our fill. Let’s depart,” Jiang Xin urged, dreading the Qin family’s arrival.

But Guan Yu shook his head. “Why flee? When they come, I’ll demand explanation for accosting my women.”

Gasps rippled through the crowd. Even Wang Xiaorong stared incredulously. Did this fool believe the Qins would apologize?

As Chu Fan leaned on Jiang Xin for support, his crutch thumped against floorboards. “Wan Hong,” he sighed, “even the Emperor treads carefully around the Qins. Why court disaster? With your backing, Red Charm Theater could flourish anew—but these provocations jeopardize everything!”

“Weakness invites oppression,” Guan Yu countered. “Only by crushing challengers can we secure peace. I act for the theater’s future.”

**Chapter 4872: Comrades**

Their philosophies clashed—Chu Fan’s timidity versus Guan Yu’s audacity. Where the theater master saw recklessness, the warrior saw necessity.

Jiang Xin interceded, “Chu Fan, trust him. Partners must stand united.”

Yet Chu Fan wavered. “If the theater falls...”

“Then take my silver and rebuild elsewhere,” Guan Yu snapped, wounded by this distrust. “Our association ends here.”

Chu Fan flushed. Jiang Xin’s disappointment grew as she compared Guan Yu’s protectiveness to her lover’s hesitance.

Qiqi patted Chu Fan’s arm. “Fear not. My man’s capabilities surpass imagination.”

**Chapter 4873: The Family Approaches**

“Miss Jiang,” Guan Yu said coldly, “leave before the Qins arrive. This doesn’t concern you.”

Torn, Jiang Xin awaited Chu Fan’s decision. The theater master’s silence spoke volumes.

“Choose,” Guan Yu pressed. “Sever ties with me tonight, or stand firm.”

Chu Fan’s gaze dropped. In his heart, he already knew—but courage failed him. Beyond the tavern windows, torchlights flickered. The Qin retinue approached.
