Guan Yu turned and walked to Qu Meimei’s side, gently patting her shoulder as he comforted, “I don’t think there’s anything to grieve over. You should feel liberated. A man like him isn’t worth your tears.”

**Chapter Two Thousand Five Hundred and Thirty-Six: An Urgent Matter**

“He’s right, Meimei,” Xue Jing chimed in. “I promise to find you a man a hundred times better. Trust me.”

The onlookers began urging divorce, their voices rising in a clamor. A plump woman in her forties, her cheeks quivering as she spoke, declared, “I say such scum should’ve been divorced long ago! Living with a drug addict only leads to ruin. There’s no other end. Cut ties now and free yourself!”

Finally, under Guan Yu and Xue Jing’s earnest persuasion and her aunt’s reassurances, Qu Meimei agreed to proceed with the divorce.

“No time to waste,” Guan Yu said. “I’ll take you to handle the paperwork now.”

Qu Meimei’s husband never imagined things would escalate to this. Regret was futile now. That Meimei would nod to divorce him—after he’d counted on her softening to his pleas—was unthinkable. *All because of that meddling bastard Guan Yu!*

Desperate, the husband seized on an excuse. “We can’t divorce today. The marriage certificates and IDs are at home. Let’s reschedule.”

*Brilliant,* he thought. *Once home, I’ll sweet-talk her into changing her mind. Then even Guan Yu’s nagging won’t matter.*

His smugness shattered as Guan Yu retorted, “No problem. One call will settle it.” Pulling out his phone, Guan Yu dialed Yang Conghan—the Yang family’s influence would smooth this.

“Conghan, I need your help urgently.”

“I’m applying a face mask!” Yang Conghan grumbled, sprawled on her Qiaoyuan District sofa testing a new skincare product.

Guan Yu blinked. “A friend needs to divorce but lost their certificates. Can it be done?”

“Since when do you rush into others’ divorces? You meddle in everything from state affairs to lost pets!” she teased.

“I’m serious—”

Her tone shifted. “Lost certificates? Easy. A call and it’s handled without them present.”

But Guan Yu insisted on formal proceedings for Meimei’s closure. After arrangements, he herded the group to the service center.

**Chapter Two Thousand Five Hundred and Thirty-Seven: Uncrossable Lines**

The fourth floor split into opposites: left adorned with red lanterns for joyous unions; right stark and joyless for severed ties. Following Yang Conghan’s contact, they met Ms. Li—a middle-aged clerk caked in thick makeup.

After paperwork and signatures, two green booklets sealed the divorce.

“Done. You’re no longer married,” Ms. Li stated.

Xue Jing embraced the weeping Meimei as Guan Yu thanked the clerk. Returning to the hospital, Guan Yu warned the ex-husband, “Stay away from the Qu family. If you trouble them again, you’ll regret it.”

The man slunk off, leaving Meimei tearfully conflicted. Xue Jing consoled her, “Time heals. I’ll introduce you to a dozen handsome men!”

At the hospital, Guan Yu assured Meimei’s aunt, “Notify me if he causes more trouble.”

“Had I known how he’d treat her…” the aunt sighed. Meimei whispered, “He changed after marriage. I don’t know why.”

“The past is gone. Let time mend this,” Xue Jing soothed before leaving with Guan Yu for Huaye Club.

**Chapter Two Thousand Five Hundred and Thirty-Eight: Prank (Part 1)**

At the club, Guan Yu and Xue Jing decided to tease Ling’er. Xue Jing barged into her locked office, pretending panic. “Ling’er! Guan Yu’s missing! Do you know where he is?”

Ling’er, diligent at her desk, frowned. “Maybe he’s taking a break? He’s invincible—nothing could happen.”

“But his enemies are hunting him!” Xue Jing pressed. “If you’re hiding his other women, tell me!”

“I don’t know anything!” Ling’er lied poorly, thoughts racing to Jin Hua—Guan Yu’s secret lover.

“Help me find him before tonight, or I’ll alert the others!”

Ling’er hesitated, torn between loyalty and worry. Xue Jing narrowed her eyes. “You’re covering for him. Admit it!”

“I…I’ll search everywhere!” Ling’er stammered, guilt staining her cheeks.

Xue Jing coldly concluded, “You’re no sister to me. If he surfaces tonight, I’ll know you lied.”
