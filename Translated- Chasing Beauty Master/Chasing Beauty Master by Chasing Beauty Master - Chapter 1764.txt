“That’s not necessarily true,” the elder of the True Sun Sect remarked. “The Eight-Sided Drum Technique originated from Patriarch Meng Hua (Transforming Dream) of the Demon Sect. Since the Demon Soul Sect descends from the Demon Sect, it’s no surprise they might have clues to the technique within their ranks. This time, the Right Envoy of the Demon Soul Sect is leading the expedition personally. Perhaps the线索 lies in his hands.”

Azhe frowned gloomily. “So you’re saying we’re still searching aimlessly while the Demon Soul Sect’s Right Envoy might have already found it?”

“It shouldn’t be that easy,” Guan Yu countered. “If the Demon Soul Sect could locate it immediately upon entering, why would they bring so many people? Wouldn’t it be smoother for the Right Envoy to come alone?”

“Look ahead! There seems to be a mountain!” shouted a True Sun Sect disciple.

The sight of a mountain reignited their hopes. Everyone turned to see a distant silhouette of peaks. Whether or not the Divine Stone Mountain’s clues pointed there, they had to investigate. Pressed for time, Guan Yu’s group resorted to flight spells to hasten their journey, while the True Sun Sect employed their own secret levitation techniques.

Upon reaching the mountain’s foothills, the group halted, gazing upward. Before them stretched not a single peak but an entire mountain range—towering, undulating ridges that dwarfed their ambitions. “This is absurd,” Guan Yu muttered in frustration. “Even with a year, we’d never find the Eight-Sided Drum Technique here.”

Though others didn’t fully grasp his words, the gist was clear. Time here mirrored the outside world inversely—night outside meant daylight within. They had until sunset here to exit before being trapped for a year. “We can’t stand idle,” Guan Yu urged. “We must search every inch.”

**BOOM!** A thunderous roar erupted as he spoke. The mountains trembled, distant flashes of spell-light suggesting a battle. “Someone’s up there,” the elder said. “Let’s investigate.” Guan Yu nodded, hoping to find Wang Jun of the Cloud Azure Sect amidst the chaos.

Approaching the commotion, they discovered not a human skirmish but a clash between beasts: a colossal white tiger and... a pheasant. The tiger, larger than the giant grizzly they’d encountered earlier, faced a seemingly ordinary pheasant no longer than thirty centimeters. Yet the bird held its ground, dodging the tiger’s spiritual projections with uncanny agility.

“That pheasant’s incredible!” a True Sun disciple marveled as the bird conjured a glass-like barrier, deflecting the tiger’s attack before ensnaring its head in a glowing net. The elder observed, “The tiger’s retreating. It’ll flee soon.”

True to his words, the tiger unleashed a final energy blast and bolted, the pheasant in furious pursuit. “These mutated beasts...” Guan Yu murmured, awed. “That pheasant could overpower even me.”

As they pressed onward, strange snoring led them to a mountainous boar—a fleshy behemoth with legs like tree trunks. When a lilting voice startled the beast awake, chaos ensued. The boar attacked, its energy beam barely deflected by Guan Yu’s hastily erected shield.

Suddenly, a girl appeared, leaping onto the boar’s back like a child at play. Despite its thrashing, she clung effortlessly until the exhausted beast surrendered. “Naughty pig!” she scolded. “Attack others again, and I’ll teach you worse!” The cowed boar lumbered away as the girl turned to the group, her cheerful demeanor belying terrifying strength.

**Chapter 4615: The White Tiger**
The tiger’s sheer size—surpassing even the giant grizzly—and its unequal battle against the tiny pheasant defied logic. Yet the pheasant’s barrier magic and tactical prowess proved superior, driving the predator to retreat.

**Chapter 4616: Bad Temper**
The mountain’s dangers multiplied as they encountered the gargantuan boar. Its ill-tempered assault was only quelled by the mysterious girl’s intervention, revealing her true nature as a shape-shifted bear spirit. Her playful dominance over the beast underscored the surreal hierarchy of this realm.

**Chapter 4617: Mistaking Humans for Ghosts**
The girl’s casual mastery left the group speechless. “Can all beasts here understand human speech?” Guan Yu wondered aloud. Her effortless victory—and the boar’s obedience—hinted at deeper truths about this city of spirits. As they pressed deeper into the treacherous peaks, every shadow seemed alive with perils and possibilities.
