“Guan Yu nodded and said, “I’ve heard a little. It’s said this organization is extremely mysterious and considered the most elite group in China. Rumor has it the higher echelons of the military are behind it, and only exceptionally formidable individuals can join.”

“Exactly! Guan Yu truly is well-informed.” Lin Qiaoqiao’s eyes sparkled. “After receiving my First-Class Merit, I coincidentally encountered the Celestial Dragon Organization’s once-every-five-years recruitment drive. Their requirements are exceedingly strict, and slots are nearly impossible to secure. I leveraged the prestige from my recent achievement to obtain a nomination for you.”

She leaned forward earnestly. “This nomination is extraordinarily rare—each major city only gets three. Joining the Celestial Dragon Organization would guarantee an immeasurably bright future!”

Xue Jing chimed in, “Guan Yu should genuinely consider this. It’s better than idling at home all day. With your capabilities, passing their screening should be effortless. Imagine becoming a super agent—how spectacular would that be?”

Guan Yu knew little about the Celestial Dragon Organization beyond rumors of brainwashed members fanatically loyal to the nation, with even their lowest-ranked operatives being Second-Class Grandmasters. He’d initially dismissed such claims as fantasy—how could any group amass so many peerless experts? Yet here was proof of its existence. Still, he felt no stirrings of interest.

With a wry smile, Guan Yu replied, “First, let me express gratitude for your kindness, Qiaoqiao. But I truly have no desire to join this organization.”

“What? Why?” Lin Qiaoqiao gaped in disbelief. “I forfeited my own First-Class Merit opportunity for this! People would kill for such a chance! This could pave your way to wealth and high status!”

Xue Jing suppressed a smile. She understood Guan Yu far better—this man valued freedom above all else. Wealth meant nothing to him, and bureaucratic ambitions held even less appeal.

**Chapter 2,437: Treating to a Grand Feast**

“I appreciate your gesture,” Guan Yu said apologetically, “but I’m genuinely uninterested. Since the nomination is so precious, perhaps offer it to someone else—or sell it for a fortune.”

Lin Qiaoqiao shot Xue Jing a pleading look, hoping she’d persuade him. Xue Jing chuckled, “Dear Qiaoqiao, we’re truly grateful, but Guan Yu won’t budge. Consider his situation—with so many beauties at home, joining some organization might make them all flee!”

“This nomination was wasted on me,” Guan Yu conceded. “I detest constraints. Different ambitions, perhaps.”

Though disappointed, Lin Qiaoqiao relented. If Guan Yu preferred the unfettered life of a businessman to navigating bureaucratic minefields, so be it. His evident wealth—this sprawling villa alone spoke volumes—confirmed his independence. She returned the documents to her purse.

Rising gracefully, Guan Yu smiled. “My refusal stands, but don’t think you’re escaping dinner!” After negotiations, they settled on Forest Grand Hotel downtown.

Initially planning to invite all the women from Qiaoyuan District, only Yingzi agreed to join—Zhang Han, Lü Mei, and others were too engrossed in gaming. Guan Yu sighed; their gaming obsession had long been entrenched, especially Zhang Han’s nocturnal marathons. He’d resorted to installing a camera and cutting her room’s power past midnight to prevent her becoming a haggard crone.

Before departing, Guan Yu urged Amei, “Come with us. Staying cooped up here is dreary.”

“But I need to cook for Hanhan and the others,” Amei protested.

“They’ll get takeout. Hurry and change.”

Amei’s face lit up. Eager for her first outing with Guan Yu in ages, she dashed upstairs.

**Forest Grand Hotel**, located in southern downtown A City’s affluent district, epitomized luxury. Lin Qiaoqiao, familiar with the area through her work at police headquarters, led them to a lavish private dining room.

Amidst sumptuous dishes and lively banter, Guan Yu enjoyed the vibrant atmosphere. Xue Jing and Lin Qiaoqiao reminisced while Yingzi bonded with Amei, who shared stories of meeting Guan Yu. Though Yingzi’s Mandarin remained halting, they communicated comfortably. Guan Yu’s gaze occasionally drifted to Lin Qiaoqiao as he toasted her repeatedly.

Midway through the feast, Amei excused herself. True to its name, the hotel boasted eco-chic decor—emerald carpets beneath gilded ceilings. Her white chiffon dress accentuated every curve, the hem teasingly modest. Male servers stole longing glances, fantasizing about breezes or dropped items offering forbidden glimpses. Female staff regarded her with envy and awe.

Emerging from the restroom, Amei crossed paths with Zhao Zhenwang—a 30-something tycoon in a tailored suit. His breath caught at her ethereal beauty. A self-made millionaire turned billionaire through tech ventures, Zhao had sampled every feminine archetype: starlets, students, socialites. Yet none compared to this vision. Mesmerized, he trailed her to Room #2 before reluctantly returning to his own banquet.

**Chapter 2,438: Play Freely**

In Room #9, Deputy Director Wan Badan of the Municipal Bureau—a brawny 50-year-old—fondled Xiao Wei, a third-tier starlet Zhao had provided. Zhao’s strategy was clear: butter up officials through carnal diplomacy.

Catching them mid-tryst, Zhao feigned outrage. “Already at it?”

Wan Badan flushed but kept Xiao Wei close. “Your girl’s irresistible!”

Zhao waved magnanimously. “What’s mine is yours. Enjoy!” His mind, however, fixated on the white-clad goddess. Casually, he mentioned, “While at the restroom, I saw this stunning woman in Room #2. Know her?”

Eager to reciprocate, Wan Badan barked at a waiter: “Fetch the white-dressed lady from Room #2! Say Deputy Director Wan Badan summons her!”

When the trembling server delivered this demand in Room #2, silence fell. Guan Yu’s smile froze, aura chilling—nothing enraged him more than threats to his women.

Lin Qiaoqiao, recognizing her superior’s name, burned with humiliation. “Tell Wan Badan to get lost!” she roared.

As the server fled, Lin Qiaoqiao fumed, “Scum! Absolute trash!”

Guan Yu squeezed Amei’s hand. “No one will touch you.”

**Chapter 2,439: The Cunning Fox**

Back in Room #9, Zhao stoked Wan Badan’s ego. “Such authority! Who’d dare refuse you?”

Drunk on power and liquor, Wan Badan bragged, “In this city, my word is law! That woman should feel honored by my invitation!”

Zhao’s mind raced—how to possess the angelic Amei? Meanwhile, Guan Yu’s group resumed their feast, tensions lingering beneath forced merriment.

Elsewhere, Wan Badan’s hands wandered over Xiao Wei as Zhao plotted. Some games required patience; others, audacity. Tonight’s stakes had just escalated.
