Turning his head, Guan Yu confirmed his suspicion — a stunning policewoman in a blue uniform walked through the door, her figure perfectly filling out the taut lines of the outfit. Carrying a dark blue briefcase, she exuded martial grace in every movement. His eyes lit up at her oval face glowing with translucent radiance, her delicate features untouched by cosmetics.

What brought this beauty here so late? As Guan Yu observed her, his thoughts drifted to uniformed temptations. How delightful if nothing lay beneath that regulation attire...

"Not too late at all. Please come in," Xue Jing warmly ushered the visitor.

As the two entered, Xue Jing introduced, "Guan Yu, this is my good friend Huang Shan. Huang Shan, this is my man, Guan Yu."

"Hello."
"Hello."

After exchanging pleasantries, Guan Yu's gaze lingered on Huang Shan. Though appearing barely twenty, her mature allure proved irresistibly enticing.

Having seen the news footage, Huang Shan inquired, "Jingjing, are you unharmed after today's incident? Why didn't anyone report such a major event?" Knowing the instigators were troublemakers, she added, "Had you filed a report, I'd have ensured justice as your friend."

"Just schoolyard bullies needing discipline," Guan Yu interjected. "Street matters settle on the streets. Involving police brings shame."

"Enough of your bravado," Xue Jing chided. "Huang Shan came seeking your help."

"My help? With what?" Guan Yu's curiosity piqued.

Huang Shan explained her mission to apprehend Li Baitian, whose smuggling operations grew increasingly brazen with supernatural accomplices deterring police involvement. Transferred to Coastal City A for this investigation, she sought aid from Xue Jing and Guan Yu as proven capable fighters.

"Assistance I can provide," Guan Yu conceded, "but do you possess concrete evidence?"

"Not yet. His coastal operations involve numerous complicit parties. Conventional police methods risk leaks given his extensive network. Hence our need for... alternative approaches."

Guan Yu deduced Li must have official connections enabling his immunity. "I'll have Jones plant moles around him. Meanwhile, have your colleagues ease surveillance to embolden his activities. Gathering irrefutable proof requires infiltration."

After Huang Shan departed, Guan Yu questioned Xue Jing, "You know I avoid such affairs. Why involve your friend?"

**Chapter 2004: New Information**

Smiling, Xue Jing revealed, "Huang Shan's no ordinary friend — she's my maternal uncle's daughter. Could I refuse family?"

Understanding dawned. Eliminating Li's supernatural gang amounted to public service anyway.

The next day, Guan Yu skipped school to study the mystical seal within Zhang Han's body — a daily ritual since discovering this curse mirroring his own. Could the Drifter's handiwork explain both? Stranger still, if Zhang Han's mother employed similar techniques... was she part of the Drifter's consciousness?

With Xue Jing and Amei shopping, home held only Guan Yu and Zhang Han in her peach-blossom patterned sleep dress. As Guan Yu pressed thumbs to her temples attempting to breach the seal, his gaze dropped to her loose neckline — and all pretense of focus vanished.

Sitting to conceal his stirrings, he found Zhang Han squirming onto his lap. Her movements revealed the dress's emptiness beneath. When her hand brushed against his arousal, Guan Yu's resolve crumbled. "Since all assume she's already mine..."

Regret followed passion. Bloodstains on the couch demanded explanation. Stuffing tissues up his nostrils, he prepared to blame nosebleeds. After carrying the exhausted girl to bed, he contacted Jones about Li Baitian — her existing informant simplified matters.

Bored by mid-afternoon, Guan Yu drove to Night Blossom Club.

"Guan Yu! News of Golden Flower!" Hou Jinshun greeted urgently. "She booked a noon flight to Capital City today but never boarded. I meant to—"

"Reliable intel?" Guan Yu interrupted. Golden Flower wouldn't use identifiable travel methods — this reeked of misdirection.

"Uncertain," Hou admitted. "But falseness within truth..."

Nodding at the paradox, Guan Yu pressed, "Other updates?"

"Li Zhiming resigned from Mack Corp, sold shares to Ma Hai — Western refugee turned powerhouse nearing Realm Lord peak. New Mack majority shareholder."

Guan Yu's brow furrowed. "A Realm Lord fleeing West? What force could expel such strength?"

Dismissing irrelevant corporate shifts, he acknowledged Hou's growing influence: "Your men prove useful. Keep mobilizing them if needed."

**Chapter 2005: The Mugger**

Upstairs, Guan Yu found Qing Linger organizing documents in black office attire, her white blouse accentuating curves.

"Big Brother Guan! You finally visit!" She beamed, serving tea.

"Neglect you? Perish the thought." His smile acknowledged her blossoming beauty.

"Treat me to dinner tonight?" she proposed.

At a roadside stall that evening, Qing Linger frowned. "Why here again?"

"Economical choice," Guan Yu grinned, noting her pre-paycheck constraints.

Post-meal strolls through Volcano Park turned reflective. "Your father served a great family as steward, yes? Their surname?"

"Zhang, I believe," Qing Linger mused. Guan Yu's pulse quickened — Zhang Han's annihilated clan?

A scream interrupted. A pockmarked mugger grabbed Qing Linger, blade at her throat.

"Steady!" Guan Yu surrendered wallet and phone, but the thief demanded more.

As the assailant retreated with Qing Linger, Guan Yu vanished — reappearing behind to dislocate the man's arm.

Police arrived promptly. "Thanks, Guan Yu," Huang Shan nodded. "My night shift."

**Chapter 2006: Transparent**

Post-arrest formalities concluded, Qing Linger blushed at Guan Yu's teasing: "Night outings require less... distracting attire."

Their laughter echoed through the park's dormant volcanic trails, shadows lengthening over secrets yet unsealed.
