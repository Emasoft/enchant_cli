“After returning home, they plan to marry her off to an old man. So Lan Yu ran away to escape this arranged marriage. The Lan family seems influential, and Lan Yu is clearly the apple of her father’s eye, his most treasured jewel. How could he bear to sacrifice his beloved daughter to some old man? Could their business be in trouble?”

Guanyu’s thoughts were abruptly severed by a searing pain erupting in his skull—as if molten mercury had been poured into his brain. He hissed through clenched teeth, circulating his internal energy until the agony gradually subsided.

The pure Yin energy he’d absorbed earlier proved invaluable, refining his spiritual force multiple times over. Yet whenever he tried recalling anything about Lan Yu, that same blinding pain returned with vengeance.

“Guanyu, are you alright?” Lan Yu abandoned her playful demeanor upon seeing him clutching his head, face drained of color.

“Have we… met long ago?” he rasped.

She blinked in confusion. “Only a few days, really.” Her answer crystallized his realization—some external force was suppressing his memories. Fragments surfaced when triggered, only to be violently quashed. No wonder Liu Shilei and the others kept isolating him from his past—they feared this exact torment.

But who orchestrated this memory prison? The invisible energy defied detection, only flaring when challenged. Since everyone around him conspired to bury his history, perhaps surrendering to the flow was wiser. Time would erode even this mystery.

**Chapter 1821: I’m Hungry**

Lan Yu watched anxiously as color slowly returned to Guanyu’s face. Oblivious to the grass-stained cut on her thigh, she stood in her crimson sundress, the short pleated skirt offering scant modesty.

“It’s nothing—just a sudden headache,” Guanyu deflected, omitting the memory suppression. Behind them, her bodyguards reported to Patriarch Lan via phone:

“Boss, the young mistress claims she’s pregnant. The man’s with her now. What should we do?”

“PREGNANT?!” The roar nearly shattered the receiver. “My Yu’er would never! You incompetent maggots!”

Lan Yunxiang, the family patriarch, was legendary for his temper. When Lan Yu snatched the phone, her declaration stunned both ends: “Old Lan, I’m carrying your grandchild. Care to reconsider your tone?”

The tycoon’s voice instantly softened. “Darling, you know I’d never willingly marry you off! But our company’s lifeline is in their hands. If I refuse, it’s prison—leaving you and your mother destitute! How could my delicate flower survive hardship?”

Guanyu approached as Lan Yu’s resolve hardened. “I’d rather laugh on the streets than cry in a limousine. I’m keeping this child.”

The declaration surprised everyone—including Guanyu. This wasn’t some pampered heiress, but a woman steeled by conviction.

Defeated, Lan Yunxiang relented: “Bring him tomorrow. Let’s meet this… suitor.”

**Chapter 1822: I’m Not Pure Anymore**

Dawn found them in an upscale restaurant’s VIP suite. Lan Yu sprawled across Guanyu’s lap, her “sleeping” smile betraying secret triumph. When morning light revealed his hand cupping her breast beneath disheveled silk, her shriek could’ve shattered crystal.

“PIG! HOW DARE YOU DEFILE ME?!” She clutched her chest dramatically. “I’m RUINED! You MUST take responsibility!”

Guanyu sniffed his suspiciously fragrant palm. “You invaded my personal space first, little actress.”

Her pout transformed into a grin. “Breakfast first. Then you’re meeting my parents. Try escaping, and I’ll haunt your dreams!”

At the Lan estate, Guanyu assessed the paradox before him—a patriarch who appeared no older than thirty, standing beside his matronly wife.

“Father’s cultivation preserves his youth,” Lan Yu stage-whispered. “Mother’s been jealous since forever!”

The couple exchanged appraising looks. “This one’s aura… extraordinary,” Madam Lan murmured. “Our daughter chose well.”

“Indeed,” Lan Yunxiang stroked his ageless chin. “Let’s see if he’s worthy.”

**Chapter 1823: The Weak**

As they settled in the opulent parlor, Guanyu peeled an orange with fluid grace, offering the first slice to Lan Yu. The gesture didn’t go unnoticed.

“So,” the patriarch leaned forward, eyes glinting. “You’d challenge our family’s crisis? A nobody against generations of power?”

Guanyu met his gaze unflinching. “The truly strong don’t sacrifice daughters. Show me this ‘unstoppable force’—I’ll demonstrate what weakness looks like.”

Outside, songbirds trilled unaware. Inside, storms gathered.
