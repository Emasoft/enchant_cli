“I’ll find a way to make that stinking monk pay later,” he thought bitterly, vowing to teach the monk a lesson and show him the consequences of crossing the Feng family.

“Guan Yu, stop talking tough from inside! If you’re a real man, come out and let me teach you a lesson today!” Young Master Feng’s taunts were transparent—he wanted Guan Yu to step outside so his gang could beat him mercilessly.

But Guan Yu had no intention of playing along. “Young Master Feng, if I *do* come out, will you flee in terror? Well, here I go…”

The moment Guan Yu finished speaking, panicked shouts erupted outside: “Quick! Surround the gates! Don’t let him out—hurry!”

**Chapter 2582: No Guts**

In truth, Guan Yu hadn’t moved an inch. Everyone in the courtyard laughed at Young Master Feng’s cowardice. Though the wall hid his face, his fading voice betrayed how he’d scurried to hide behind his men.

Shen Sheng shook his head, amused. “Who’d have thought Young Master Feng would be so terrified of Brother Guan Yu? Pathetic.”

“This is nothing,” Wei Hongwei chimed in. “If our boss actually stepped out, he’d piss himself on the spot.”

Young Master Feng, realizing Guan Yu had bluffed him, crept forward cautiously. A bodyguard whispered, “Sir, there’s no movement inside. What’s happening?”

Relief washed over Feng. He’d spent fortunes hiring world-class assassins to kill Guan Yu, only to watch even a First-Class expert fall to him. Since then, fear of Guan Yu had seeped into his bones.

But today, surrounded by bodyguards, Feng mustered false bravado. “Guan Yu’s a cowardly turtle! Too scared to face me! I thought he feared nothing, but he’s just a spineless worm!”

Guan Yu ignored the provocation. Xiao Bai, however, shouted back: “You dare mock us? Your mob outnumbers us ten to one, yet you demand a fair fight? Shame on you!”

Though Guan Yu winced at Xiao Bai’s bluntness, the words rang true. Feng’s hypocrisy was staggering—flaunting his numbers while cowering at a single taunt.

“Guan Yu!” Feng jeered. “If you lack the guts to come out, stop pretending to be tough!”

“Careful, Feng,” Guan Yu replied coolly. “Remember what I did to Young Master Ran? Reduced him to a babbling fool who soils himself. Would you like to join him?”

Feng paled, recalling Ran’s fate—a broken man, still bedridden. He staggered back but clung to his bodyguards’ presence. “Enough! Hand over the treasure map, and we’ll leave peacefully. No trouble for you or this temple.”

“Treasure map?” Guan Yu feigned surprise. “Too late. The Sky-Soaring Wolf stole it before you arrived.”

“Sky-Soaring Wolf?” Feng frowned. A bodyguard explained: “One of the Jianghu’s Ten Great Villains. Ruthless, massacred a village overnight. Extremely skilled.”

Feng scoffed. “Some villain? You expect me to believe you’d lose to him? Stop lying!”

Guan Yu shrugged. “He poisoned our water. Everyone here can attest to it.”

Shen Sheng nodded. “True. We’ve all been poisoned. The map is gone.”

“Lies!” Feng spat. “You’re all in cahoots! Last chance—surrender the map, or this temple burns!”

“Try it,” Guan Yu retorted. “But keep your head tucked between your legs—it might roll otherwise.”

A bodyguard urged Feng: “Let’s charge! We outnumber them!”

“Fool!” Feng smacked the man’s head. “You don’t know Guan Yu’s power! Charging in blindly is suicide!”

Guan Yu relaxed slightly—his bluff had bought time. “Seek the Sky-Soaring Wolf for your map. Even with 2,000 men, you couldn’t stop me.”

Feng’s anxiety deepened. He ordered a spy to scale the wall. Guan Yu, anticipating this, hid everyone inside.

**Chapter 2583: Not a Soul in Sight**

The clumsy bodyguard finally peered over the three-meter wall—only to be met with a brick to the skull. He tumbled down, bloodied and unconscious.

“Useless!” Feng kicked the man. “Another! Scout properly this time!”

The next climber suffered the same fate. “Sir… the courtyard’s empty. No one’s there!”

“Impossible!” Feng hissed. “We heard them! Are they ghosts?!”

Another advisor urged attack, but Feng wavered. “What if it’s a trap?”

**Chapter 2584: Scaling the Wall**

Feng sent three men simultaneously. From the hall, Guan Yu’s ally Xue Jing hurled bricks, striking two. Guan Yu lobbed a full brick with surprising force, knocking the third down.

“They’re lying!” Feng roared upon hearing repeated reports of an empty courtyard. “Charge! Everyone over the walls now!”

As the mob scrambled, Guan Yu’s group emerged, ready. Xue Jing gripped bricks in both hands, while Guan Yu stood calm—a storm awaiting its moment.
