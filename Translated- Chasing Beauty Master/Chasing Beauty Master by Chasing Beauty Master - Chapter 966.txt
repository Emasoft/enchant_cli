The two vehicles sped swiftly, one leading and one trailing, escorting Guan Yu to a marble factory in the southern district. Only then did Guan Yu realize who had summoned him.

Shen Fangcheng—a man of considerable renown and influence. Guan Yu had long heard of him and already surmised the purpose behind this meeting.

Following the entourage into a warehouse-like space, Guan Yu found Shen Fangcheng playing mahjong with three others. A sizable crowd loomed around them.

The sheer number of guards signaled this was no simple affair. Shen Fangcheng, indulging with three beauties at the mahjong table, seemed in high spirits. Guan Yu and Xue Jing halted five meters away, blocked from approaching further.

Guan Yu smirked. “My time is precious. I’m surprised the son of Boss Chen has been arrested, yet you still find leisure to play cards with *no one*. Such admirable composure.”

Shen Fangcheng, affable in demeanor, offered, “Care to join us for a round, Boss Guan?”

“Not interested,” Guan Yu replied bluntly. “Did you summon me today merely for games?”

“Heh, of course not.” Shen Fangcheng discarded a tile as he spoke. “I invited you to discuss serious matters. Your Yu Gang dominates the city—the first gang to emerge from university circles. Truly impressive.”

“Ah, I win!” one of the women exclaimed.

“Credit goes to everyone’s support,” Guan Yu deflected. “Reputation is bestowed, not claimed. Don’t you agree, Boss Shen?”

Guan Yu knew tension was inevitable. With Jia Bo’s reinforcements still en route, caution was paramount. He refused to let Xue Jing risk injury, even with her cultivation.

Shen Fangcheng rose, facing Guan Yu. The middle-aged man stood slight and lean, his polished smile baring white teeth. “Let’s address business. Your woman arrested my son. Release him, and I’ll owe you a favor.”

“You’ve mistaken me,” Guan Yu feigned ignorance. “*My* woman? Do you mean the one beside me?”

“Spare the act!” Shen snapped. “Captain Lin Qiaoqiao of the Municipal Bureau’s Criminal Investigation Division—your *close* associate. You orchestrated my son’s arrest. Deny it again!”

Guan Yu shrugged. “You overestimate my influence. Lin and I are mere acquaintances. Even if I asked her to release him, she’d refuse.”

The refusal hung clear. Shen’s gaze turned venomous. “Stop fucking around! I’m negotiating civilly, yet you spout nonsense. Think I fear you? ‘Acquaintances’? Bullshit! You schemed to make her captain, helped her arrest dozens overnight, solved cases to secure her position—did you think I’d ignore this?

“You’ve made enemies aiding her, yet dare claim neutrality? Call her now! Order my son’s release, or face consequences!”

Shen’s outburst revealed exhaustive intelligence—and a temper laced with vulgarities that grated on Guan Yu.

Guan Yu’s expression darkened. “Consider the cost of your tone. Do you believe I’d walk into your den unprepared? I’ve survived countless traps. ‘How can one obtain tiger cubs without entering the tiger’s den?’ Today, I’ll send both you and your son to prison.”

“You think I won’t strike?” Shen roared. A staunch traditionalist, he prized his son above all—even his own life. To him, legacy meant nothing without a male heir. The thought of his son imprisoned for years ignited fury. “Kill them! Beat them to death!”

A thug with a dragon tattoo lunged, fist swinging.

Though devoid of cultivation, Guan Yu retained combat reflexes and superior strength. He sidestepped, seizing the attacker’s wrist. Xue Jing pivoted, her heel smashing the man’s face with a sickening *crunch*. Blood sprayed as he flew three meters, nose shattered.

Shen gaped at Xue Jing’s prowess. “Don’t let them escape! Kill them!”

Forty henchmen swarmed like rabid wolves. Xue Jing danced around Guan Yu, striking ruthlessly, but numbers overwhelmed. Guan Yu, still recuperating, hesitated to engage—until he drew his Desert Eagle and fired.

***Bang!***

The ceiling fan shuddered, halting the mob. Terror replaced bloodlust as all recoiled. Shen paled, regretting leaving his own pistol in the mahjong table’s drawer.

“Advance, and I’ll scatter brains!” Guan Yu barked, aiming at Shen. “A true leader sends men to die while cowering?”

Shen inched backward until the gun pressed his temple. “Move closer. Let’s... *discuss*.”

A hulking brute lunged from behind. Xue Jing’s backward kick shattered his jaw, teeth flying. Shen scrambled for his drawer—but Guan Yu’s second shot pierced the mahjong table.

***Bang!***

Screams erupted as the three women cowered. “Hands up!” Guan Yu ordered.

Shen froze, sweat-drenched, as Guan Yu pressed the barrel to his head. “Try me again, and your skull splatters.”

Trembling, Shen pleaded, “N-No grudges here! Please—lower the gun!”

Guan Yu scoffed. “Your hospitality disappoints. Your son’s fate? Karma. Yet you dare challenge me?”

The pistol’s nudge sent Shen collapsing. “Spare me! I beg you!”

Guan Yu surveyed the lingering henchmen. “Your men still eye me hungrily. Unwise.”

“Scram, you worthless rats!” Shen bellowed. The crowd vanished instantly, leaving only a urine-soaked secretary trembling by the table.

Guan Yu retrieved Shen’s unused Norinco pistol from the drawer. “New firearms lack reliability. Seasoned weapons serve better.” He tossed it to Xue Jing.

Defeated, Shen groveled. “Name your price! I’ll pay any ransom!”

“Open your safe,” Guan Yu demanded, kicking Shen toward his secretary. “Empty it.”

As Xue Jing escorted the woman, Jia Bo’s men stormed in.

Jia Bo panted, “Boss! We broke through—their men fled like ghosts!”

Guan Yu nodded. “Recently, Yu Gang members were ambushed nightly. Last night, two had legs shattered. Explain.”

Jia Bo confirmed, “True. One may never walk again.”

Rage flared. Guan Yu kicked Shen sprawling, gun grinding into his skull. “Your doing?”

Shen wailed, “I’m innocent! I swear!”

“Liar?” Guan Yu snarled. “I’ll paint the walls with your brains!”

Shen wept, “Mercy! I’d never harm your men!”

Guan Yu’s grip tightened. Outside, chaos hinted at Jia Bo’s reinforcements. The true reckoning had just begun.
