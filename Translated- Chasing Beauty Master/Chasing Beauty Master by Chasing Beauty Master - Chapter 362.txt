Originally, because of Guan Yu, Jiang Ziqin was seething with anger inside. Guan Yu's final phone call completely ignited his rage.

At this moment, Jiang Ziqin had even considered using all his resources to make Guan Yu completely disappear from the earth.

His fingernails continued digging into his flesh, blood still dripping down. The bone-chilling pain cleared Jiang Ziqin's mind as his murderous intent gradually faded, his complexion returning to calmness.

Ultimately, reason triumphed over impulse - he had restrained himself once again!

"Xiao Dao, I'm entrusting this matter to you!" Jiang Ziqin ordered indifferently.

Xiao Dao glanced at Jiang Ziqin through the rearview mirror, nodding slightly. The heavy Hummer disappeared into the darkness with a roar of its engine.

In the teahouse's private room...

Guan Yu sat comfortably on the sofa. After hearing sharp static from the phone, he immediately held it away from his ear. When he brought it back, only dial tone remained.

A faint smile touched Guan Yu's lips, profound and meaningful.

He looked up at Li Xi, finding her gaze fixed on him with intense questioning in her eyes.

Guan Yu shrugged, waving his phone: "Probably broke his phone - what a spendthrift!"

"He agreed?" Li Xi countered.

Guan Yu shook his head, smiling: "We only spoke halfway before his phone became scrap metal!"

Li Xi slightly narrowed her eyes: "What will you do now?"

"What to do?" Guan Yu stretched lazily, yawning: "Wait here for news. Can't wander around Beijing - finding it would take ages!"

"You're certain he'll help search?"

Though Li Xi didn't know the source of Guan Yu's confidence, all his actions indicated Jiang Ziqin would unconditionally help recover the car.

"Not certainty - he has no choice!" Guan Yu smiled.

He shifted on the sofa, patting the space beside him with childish innocence: "Looks like we won't sleep tonight. Come, let's squeeze in together!"

The Italian leather sofa could barely fit two. For a man and woman, it might be interesting - depending on the woman.

Li Xi simply ignored him, finding a comfortable position in her chair, closing her eyes in feigned sleep.

Guan Yu found this dull. Resting his head on clasped hands, he stared at the ceiling, eyes gleaming with unspoken thoughts.

Deep night at Jiang Ziqin's residence...

Xiao Dao delivered documents about Li Xi's stolen luxury car - information gathered remarkably fast through special forces connections.

Jiang Ziqin's smile grew dangerous as he reviewed them. Texting rapidly, he finally pressed send.

"Guan Yu, I've given your information. I wonder if you'll live to retrieve your car!" he murmured, staring at his phone.

Guan Yu's phone vibrated, waking both him and Li Xi.

"Seems our wait paid off!" Guan Yu waved his phone.

"Where's the car?" Li Xi demanded.

"Shunfeng Auto Shop."

"And your plan?"

"Wait longer!" Guan Yu lay back smiling.

"Wait?" Li Xi looked perplexed.

"Because I don't trust Jiang Ziqhi!" came the reply.

Just then, Guan Yu's phone vibrated again with two words: "The Aristocracy".

Chapter 911: Taking the Risk

As engine roars shattered the night, three luxury cars pulled up at Shunfeng Auto Shop. The red Ferrari's door opened, revealing a young man with incongruously trendy clothes.

"Xiao Liu, start work!" Zhao Yan tossed keys to an assistant.

While workers swarmed the cars with tools, Zhao Yan studied documents found in the Ferrari. Suddenly, a booming laugh interrupted:

"Bro Yan, good haul tonight!"

Shop owner Chen Gang approached. "These cars can't compare to your collection here!"

"Without you, this shop wouldn't exist," Chen Gang modestly waved.

As they bantered, Chen noticed the documents. "What's that?"

"Found in the Ferrari. Probably junk." Zhao Yan shrugged.

"Toss it. Paper's worthless compared to this beauty!" Chen Gang gestured at the Ferrari.
