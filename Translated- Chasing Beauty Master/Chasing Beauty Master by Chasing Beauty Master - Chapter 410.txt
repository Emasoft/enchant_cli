“Do you know you’re torturing me to death?” Guan Yu felt utterly helpless. Why did his wife seem more like a little devil the longer he looked at her? How could she play such a joke?

“Oh? I didn’t know!” Wen Qing replied innocently, though her delicate, lily-white fingers trailed teasingly over his body, sending a shiver down his spine.

“Sweetheart, could you… use your mouth?” Guan Yu pleaded pitifully.

“No!”

“Why not?!”

“My teeth hurt!”

“……”

After begging in vain, Guan Yu failed to persuade her. But perhaps out of pity, Wen Qing eventually used her hands to relieve him.

Watching her large, blinking eyes, hearing her soft moans, and feeling her tender hands work vigorously, Guan Yu found immense satisfaction. He wrapped his arms around her fragrant body and drifted into sleep.

The next morning, a refreshed Guan Yu encountered Wen Baoguo, his father-in-law, who sported dark circles under his eyes. Staring at his haggard appearance, Guan Yu exclaimed in shock, “Father-in-law! What happened? Did Mother-in-law beat you up?”

**Chapter 1026: Journey to the Dongfang Family**

The question ignited Wen Baoguo’s temper. He lunged to throttle Guan Yu, only to be harshly scolded by the two elderly patriarchs returning from their morning exercise.

Wen Baoguo’s frustration stemmed from the previous night’s failed attempt to rekindle his marital vigor with acupuncture help from Guan Yu. Left to embrace his still-youthful wife without success, he had tossed and turned all night, startling Liu Yunshu upon waking.

“Baoguo, you’re a dignified minister! Must you act so frivolously, bickering like a child?” Wen Shuquan chided. Liu Jingguo echoed the sentiment, questioning his professionalism.

“I think Dad’s quite endearing, like an old imp!” Wen Qing interjected. Wen Baoguo coughed awkwardly—her words sounded complimentary yet carried a hint of mockery.

After a tense breakfast, Guan Yu retreated with Liu Yunshu to resume her acupuncture sessions. The patriarchs eagerly awaited news of a grandchild, and delaying further would risk Wen Baoguo’s wrath.

Thanks to her healthy lifestyle, the treatment progressed smoothly. “Xiao Yu, if you succeed, you’ll be the savior of both our families!” Wen Shuquan exclaimed joyfully. Liu Jingguo added, “Could you… increase the chances of a boy?”

Liu Yunshu sighed. “Fathers, boys or girls are equally precious. Don’t pressure Xiao Yu!”

Wen Qing pouted. “Grandpa, Grandfather, do you dislike me?”

“Of course not!” Wen Baoguo flushed. “A grandson would be nice, but another granddaughter like you would be just as welcome!”

**Chapter 1027: The Reckless Dongfang Huowu**

That afternoon, Guan Yu sought Dongfang Mu but realized he had no contact details. He called Jiang Ziqi, who eagerly agreed to accompany him.

“Dongfang Mu’s aid yesterday was personal, not the family’s stance,” Jiang Ziqi’s father, Jiang Shang, mused. “But this meeting could be an opportunity for alliance—or even succession.”

After a lengthy drive through traffic-clogged streets, they arrived at the Dongfang estate—a centuries-old village nestled against mountains, its rustic charm belying the luxury cars parked nearby.

“A developer once eyed this land,” Jiang Ziqi explained. “His company went bankrupt overnight. Only Dongfang’s core lineage resides here.”

A sudden collision interrupted them. A fiery-haired woman stormed from a bright red Ferrari, her revealing outfit and stiletto heels clashing with the serene setting.

“You think crashing into me is a clever pickup tactic?” Dongfang Huowu (Fire Dance) sneered, her confidence bordering on delusion.

Guan Yu rolled his eyes. “Spare the drama. I’ve no interest in someone dressed like a traffic light.”

“How dare you!” She lunged, but he caught her wrist. Screaming “Molesty!”, she bit his arm. Enraged, Guan Yu spanked her firmly, the sharp slaps echoing until her defiance melted into tears.

“Stop crying!” he groaned, shirt soaked. “I didn’t hit *that* hard!”

**Chapter 1028: Provocation**

Jiang Ziqi watched, torn between amusement and dread. *If Dongfang Mu’s goal was matchmaking, Guan Yu just lit a powder keg.*

Huowu’s reputation preceded her—a wild, star-obsessed heiress shunned by suitors. Her tantrum now threatened to upend the delicate visit.

“Let’s go,” Jiang Ziqi urged. “Before the whole clan descends.”

But Huowu clung to Guan Yu, her earlier fury replaced by hiccuping sobs. As curious onlookers gathered, Guan Yu realized: surviving the Dongfang family might prove harder than defeating the Song clan.
