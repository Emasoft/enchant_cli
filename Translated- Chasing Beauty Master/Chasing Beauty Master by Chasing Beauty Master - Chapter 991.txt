“Thank you all the same. Meeting you has truly been our Qu family's greatest fortune,” Auntie said with a beaming smile. Every time Guanyu visited, she would shower him with gratitude no matter how he tried to dissuade her.

Seeing Auntie in stable condition, Guanyu decided not to linger. “If there's nothing else needing attention, I'll take my leave now. Please contact me immediately should anything arise – I'll come at once.”

“Of course, go attend to your affairs. I'm perfectly fine here – no need to check on me so often.”

After Xue Jing bid farewell to Auntie, she followed Guanyu out of the hospital room.

“Guanyu, wait...”

As Guanyu turned, he found Qu Meimei hurrying after him. “Meimei? What is it?”

The young woman lowered her head, discomfort written across her features. The weight of her family's debts to Guanyu made her request feel like another imposition.

Guanyu smiled gently. “Speak plainly, Meimei. I noticed your troubled expression earlier – does this concern your husband?”

She nodded. “I...I need to ask a favor.”

“Consider it done. Treat me as your elder brother – there's no need for hesitation.” Guanyu understood the Qu family's upright nature – their self-reliance made requests for help painfully difficult. Even offered assistance felt like charity they scarcely deserved.

“It's...it's complicated. I shouldn't trouble you...” Her voice dwindled to a whisper.

Guanyu leaned closer. “I noticed your husband has grown alarmingly thin. Is he ill? If medical treatment is needed, I'll cover the expenses – no repayment required.”

He assumed financial strain prevented treatment for some chronic condition. Xue Jing, sensing the younger woman's distress, took Meimei's hand. “We're family. Whatever it is, we'll help.”

Guanyu's mind raced – perhaps a sensitive male health issue? He began reaching for his wallet when Meimei blurted:

“He...he's using drugs!”

“What?!” Xue Jing gasped. Guanyu stiffened – this changed everything. Drug addiction meant legal consequences.

“The addiction worsens daily,” Meimei continued through tears. “When denied money...he beats me.”

Xue Jing gripped her shoulders. “Why endure this? Divorce him!”

Meimei recoiled as if struck. In her rural upbringing, divorce was unthinkable – a failed marriage meant lifelong stigma. “My parents spent everything on our wedding...I can't...”

“Nonsense!” Guanyu interjected. “We'll have him detox first, then you divorce. That's non-negotiable.”

“But...must we divorce?” Meimei pleaded.

Xue Jing glared in frustration. “He's a monster! After detox, I'll find you a proper city husband –”

“Perhaps Guanyu himself could–”

“Xue Jing!” Guanyu cut her off sharply. The suggestion hung awkwardly until he redirected: “Consent to divorce now, and I'll ensure his compliance.”

As Meimei wavered, the hospital door burst open. A gaunt man – eyes wild – lunged at his wife: “You whore! Divorce? Over my dead body!”

He yanked Meimei's hair, flinging her across the corridor. Xue Jing slapped him hard while Guanyu seized the addict's collar, delivering two stinging blows.

“Striking women? You disgrace manhood!” Guanyu snarled.

The man spat blood. “Since when do outsiders meddle in family affairs? I'll beat my wife as I please!”

Xue Jing helped the sobbing Meimei up. “Call the police! Let them handle this trash!”

At the threat, the addict paled. “Domestic discipline isn't illegal!”

“Assault is!” Xue Jing retorted as onlookers gathered.

Guanyu tightened his grip. “Stay away from Meimei, or prison awaits. Detox and divorce – now.”

“Never!”

Another slap echoed. Guanyu dialed authorities as Auntie limped out, aghast. Xue Jing explained the drug abuse and abuse.

The crowd murmured condemnation: “Such vermin deserve execution!”

Auntie embraced her daughter, weeping. “My poor child...we'll face this together.”

Guanyu pressed his phone to the addict's ear. “Last chance.”

Terrified of imprisonment, the man broke: “I agree! Just don't call!”

Guanyu ended the call. “Remember this choice.” Releasing him, he turned to the shattered family. Justice, though messy, had begun.
