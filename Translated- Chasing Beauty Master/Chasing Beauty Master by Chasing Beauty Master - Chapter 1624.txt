The prince was willing to provide free accommodation and medical treatment for the injured, clearly demonstrating his sincerity. Those willing to stay could wait here, while those unwilling were free to leave at any time. The mercenaries employed by the prince received daily payments without a single copper coin owed to anyone.

Before Zou Wuhui arrived earlier, he had withdrawn over three hundred carts of silver from the bank. Upon arriving, he distributed all outstanding payments to everyone.

Zou Wuhui announced, “His Highness also has a message for you all: if anyone finds his arrangements unsatisfactory, they may leave immediately without obligation. Those who approve of His Highness’s conduct and wish to follow him may rest here to recover while awaiting his envoy to retrieve you.”

Hong Ren immediately declared, “We all willingly obey His Highness’s arrangements. Every member of my group remains here, ready to serve.”

Zou Wuhui felt gratified by their response. Whether injured or unharmed, not a single person had left, indicating unanimous approval of the prince’s decisions.

When physicians arrived to treat severe wounds requiring disinfection, Wang Xiaorong grew bored and dragged Guan Yu out to accompany her shopping.

Once outside, Wang Xiaorong asked, “Guan Yu, where should we find a suitable girl for Hong Ren?”

“Are you serious? This matchmaking idea is ill-advised. The environment here is unsuitable, and we have urgent matters to attend to. We might depart tomorrow – how can such important decisions be made impulsively? Please be reasonable.”

“Nonsense! When Xiao Zhi met Du Bingyan, wasn’t it the same situation? If Xiao Zhi succeeded, why can’t Hong Ren? Frankly, Hong Ren seems far more desirable than that pudgy Xiao Zhi anyway.”

Guan Yu sighed. “Xiao Zhi and Du Bingyan had fate’s blessing, encountering each other multiple times in one night. But we’re strangers here – where would we find a suitable match for Hong Ren?”

Wang Xiaorong insisted earnestly, “We must try! Poor Hong Ren loved that girl since childhood only to see her marry another. If I were him, I’d be devastated. Finding him a good match here is essential for my peace of mind.”

Guan Yu realized this was the first time he’d seen Wang Xiaorong so invested in others’ affairs. Resigned to her stubbornness, he knew arguing was futile – once this young mistress set her mind on something, not even ten oxen could pull her back.

“Finding a suitable girl will be challenging,” Guan Yu remarked as they wandered the streets. “We can’t simply accost every pretty maiden we see – that would be outrageous.”

“Of course not! We need to facilitate a destined encounter. As you said, true connections require fate’s intervention.” Wang Xiaorong adopted the manner of a flower-picking rogue, scrutinizing every young woman they passed until the targets grew flustered.

Their behavior attracted strange looks, with many assuming Wang Xiaorong was deranged. Had she been male, they’d have been driven off long ago. Though Guan Yu worried about potential rejection from Hong Ren, he humored his companion’s whims.

Bajia City’s bustling streets overflowed with shops and stalls. Legend held that eight refugee families surnamed Ba settled here generations ago, surviving on toxic wild peaches whose pits they learned to avoid. Through imperial patronage and cultivation, these “honey peaches” became regional treasures, transforming the settlement into today’s prosperous city.

As Guan Yu purchased two large peaches from a vendor, Wang Xiaorong reminisced, “Father had these delivered to me at the Mohist Sect. They taste even better fresh!”

“They’re ordinary compared to my homeland’s twenty-plus varieties,” Guan Yu replied blandly. Their stroll led them to a crowd watching street performers – an elderly swordsman and a nimble girl juggling flower vases with her feet.

When Wang Xiaorong insisted on staying, Guan Yu noticed her intense focus on the young acrobat – a petite beauty with a single dimple who executed perfect splits and precision kicks. As the act concluded, a well-dressed nobleman accosted them: “Take your squabbling elsewhere! You’re blocking my view of the performance.”

Wang Xiaorong tried to defuse the situation, but the aristocrat demanded an apology. His attendants threatened violence until Guan Yu noticed a child stealing coins meant for the performers. Seizing the thief’s wrist, Guan Yu confronted the petty crime as tensions escalated...
