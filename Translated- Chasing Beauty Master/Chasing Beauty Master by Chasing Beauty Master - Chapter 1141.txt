“No need for introductions. We’ve all heard of your identity,” Lai Huangsi said jovially. “As the eldest young master of the mighty Bill family—a name anyone in business circles recognizes after all these years—the Feng family is truly blessed to have such an esteemed patron like yourself offering assistance.”

Bill Lin swelled with pride at the praise, laughing heartily. “Brother Lai flatters me. I’m merely following my father’s orders to aid the Feng family. Their greatest challenge now is dealing with this Guan Yu character—the main reason we’ve invited your help.”

“Guan Yu? What sort of man is he? Does he have three heads and six arms?” Lai Huangsi scoffed. “With the combined might of the Feng and Bill families, how could he possibly withstand you?”

Lai Huangsi knew the Bill family’s influence well, and the Fengs ranked among the four great clans. Yet these two powerhouses needed outsiders to handle one man? Being newcomers unfamiliar with Guan Yu, he and Qiu Wanzhang naturally found this puzzling.

Bill Lin wasn’t surprised by their reaction. Rather than explain Guan Yu’s capabilities, he said smoothly, “We prioritize stability. I dislike acting without full confidence—surely you share this approach, Brother Lai?”

“Haha, of course! Everyone prefers assured outcomes. Young Master Feng briefed me thoroughly—you want me to pose as a black-market merchant? That’s child’s play for me,” Lai Huangsi replied, beaming.

Bill Lin’s spirits lifted. If Young Master Feng had found such eager collaborators, this scheme would unfold perfectly.

As Bill Lin basked in satisfaction, Qiu Wanzhang interjected, “I’ve squeezed time from my hectic schedule out of respect for Young Master Feng. Since we’re all informed, let’s discuss compensation.”

**Chapter 2919: Not Ideal**

Bill Lin hadn’t expected price negotiations to precede the actual planning, but acknowledged, “Fair enough. No one works for free. Brother Qiu, what figure do you have in mind?”

“While the task isn’t arduous,” Qiu Wanzhang said, “we’ll bear significant liability. My schedule’s packed—insufficient payment might leave me... unavailable. What’s your perspective, Elder Lai?”

He deftly passed the ball. Lai Huangsi laughed loudly, “Now, now! Since we’re here out of respect for Young Master Feng, let’s not be greedy. My long partnership with the Fengs has always been harmonious. Discussing money so bluntly feels... uncouth.”

Bill Lin watched the duo with disdain—clearly performing a good-cop-bad-cop routine to maximize their cut.

“For our first collaboration,” Bill Lin said briskly, “I’ll be direct. Though the Bill family’s coffers are deep, we don’t toss money carelessly. Considering your statuses, five million should be respectable ‘appearance fees.’ How you split it is your affair. Satisfied?”

He studied their reactions, inwardly amused. While five million seemed generous, splitting it two ways implied 2.5 million each—a clever insult masked as largesse.

Lai Huangsi rubbed his broad jaw thoughtfully. The sum pleased him—typical of the world’s wealthiest clan’s extravagance. Yet he and Young Master Feng had prearranged equal division. However, splitting five million three ways (including Feng) would diminish returns.

Catching Young Master Feng’s subtle headshake, Lai Huangsi understood the offer fell short.

“Bill Young Master,” he sighed, “I’m not being greedy. Five million is substantial, but forging secure false identities requires greasing numerous bureaucratic palms. Insufficient funds would delay progress...”

Noticing Bill Lin’s darkening expression, Lai Huangsi trailed off.

“Gentlemen,” Bill Lin countered coolly, “I offered five million precisely for swift, efficient cooperation. You find this inadequate? How...”

Qiu Wanzhang cut in, “After identity fabrication and institutional bribes, we’d each net under a million—paltry considering the legal risks we’re absorbing. Rest assured, if things sour, we’ll never implicate you.”

This last point intrigued Bill Lin. Paid mercenaries bearing full responsibility? An excellent safeguard.

“Very well,” Bill Lin nodded. “I appreciate your discretion. But name your price outright.”

He’d test their demands. Excessive quotes would prompt him to hire cheaper alternatives elsewhere.

Lai Huangsi excused himself to “use the restroom”—actually seeking Feng’s counsel. As he left, Bill Lin pressed Qiu Wanzhang: “What fee would satisfy you?”

Flustered, Qiu deferred to Lai Huangsi. Moments later, Feng “coincidentally” joined Lai Huangsi in the restroom.

“We agreed to split fifty-fifty,” Lai Huangsi whispered, “but overshooting might scare him off. What’s safe?”

Feng reasoned, “Ten million maximum. Insignificant to the Bills. If he refuses, he’ll find others anyway—better we secure some profit.”

**Chapter 2920: Suitable**

“Understood.” Lai Huangsi washed up and returned, Bill Lin noting the synchronized bathroom trip but dismissing suspicions.

“Apologies for the wait!” Lai Huangsi chuckled, patting his belly. “Troublesome stomach—acted up until I reached the toilet, then miraculously healed!”

Bill Lin raised an eyebrow. “Oh? Young Master Feng’s stomach troubled him too? Unusual—he’s never had such issues before.”

“Who knows?” Lai Huangsi waved dismissively. “Let’s resume. Five million won’t suffice—bribes alone cost over two million. What remains barely compensates our risks.”

His message was clear: Pay more or we walk.

Bill Lin glared. These grifters deemed five million insufficient for simple subterfuge? Were they not ideal candidates, he’d have ejected them already.
