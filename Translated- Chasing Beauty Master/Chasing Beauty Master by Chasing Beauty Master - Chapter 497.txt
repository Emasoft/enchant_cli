“But…” At the thought of taking action, Guan Yu felt another headache—what technique should he use to counterattack? If he employed moves from his otherworldly knowledge, he might pummel the opponent thoroughly, but would that be appropriate? It might even expose his human identity!

What about using magic? That presented an even thornier problem. So far, Guan Yu could only conjure sparks, splash water, and burst rocks—hardly impressive spells. Presenting such pitiful skills would surely invite ridicule.

“Ah!” Inspiration suddenly struck. “I saw every detail of Bandley’s Thunderous Fist from its wind-up to impact on my arm. Why not use this chance to practice that technique?”

Had others known Guan Yu’s thoughts, their jaws would’ve dropped. While facing a raging beast of an opponent, this youth calmly attempted to mimic a basic Yellow-tier technique mid-battle—such composure in mortal danger could only belong to Guan Yu.

Though grandly named, the Thunderous Fist served merely as fundamental training for novice mages. Bandley’s initial use of this technique reflected his contempt. Now upgrading to a Mystic-tier skill revealed he regarded Guan Yu as a genuine threat.

As Guan Yu pondered, Bandley completed his preparations. Bitten by prior humiliation, the aggressor no longer rushed blindly. His piercing gaze tracked Guan Yu’s every motion, anticipating countermeasures.

With calm breaths, Guan Yu positioned his hands before his chest, mentally reconstructing Bandley’s fist technique. His clenched fists lacked any elemental infusion—unsurprising for a self-taught novice unaware of elemental channeling methods.

Spectators exchanged baffled glances as Guan Yu awkwardly mimicked punches. The instructor frowned. “Is this fool playacting to lower Bandley’s guard? Waiting to exploit an opening when attacked…”

“Is he performing street theater?”

“Looks like he’s trying Thunderous Fist… but executed horribly.”

For two minutes, Guan Yu endured this humiliating scrutiny. Bandley’s patience finally snapped. “Enough tricks, boy! Taste this—Gale Slash!”

A crimson arc blazed from Bandley’s palm, sword-like radiance lancing toward Guan Yu’s skull. At the fatal moment—shriiink!—the energy blade split around a azure-glowing fist emerging from its core.

**Chapter 1259: Amy the Angel**

Resolved, Guan Yu smiled at the boy. “Younger brother, could you point me to the Advanced Magic Training Grounds?”

To his dismay, the child shook his head. “We’re forbidden there until becoming senior mages.”

“No matter. I’ll ask elsewhere.” As Guan Yu turned, familiar cries interrupted.

“Dragonkin brother! Dragonkin brother!”

He sighed. “That persistent girl…”

Amy materialized before him, pouting. “Who’s ‘persistent’? Abandoning me at the amusement park while you adventure? How rude!”

Guan Yu shrugged. “This isn’t playtime for me, unlike someone.”

Arguing proved futile—Amy’s logic bent reality itself. After brief silence, she declared: “I don’t care! Wherever you go, I’m following!”

Seeking higher magic training, Guan Yu devised an escape. “Answer one question, and I’ll comply.”

“Ask! Lie and you’re a puppy!”

“Where’s the Advanced Training Grounds?”

Amy clapped excitedly. “That’s all? I know! I used to visit often! Why? Learning magic?”

Guan Yu arched an eyebrow. Despite Amy’s middling skills, she accessed restricted areas—privilege of being the chief’s daughter. “Special treatment exists in every world,” he mused.

“What was that?”

“Nothing. Lead the way.”

Their departure attracted young trainees. As admirers swarmed Amy, Kaiser arrived brandishing a switch. “Lazing again? Three extra hours for loafers!”

“Bullying children now?” Amy’s voice froze Kaiser’s wrath.

“L-Lady Amy! What honor! You haven’t visited…”

“To watch you torment children?” Amy retorted.

Kaiser stammered excuses until trainees revealed lash marks and bruises. A boy lifted his shirt—crisscrossed welts. Another exposed bruised buttocks, drawing nervous laughter.

Amy’s eyes moistened. These youths endured harsh training while she lived carefree. “Kaiser,” her voice turned steel, “I’ll overlook past deeds. But future abuses will bring reckoning.”

Cheers erupted. Some trainees wept. Kaiser hung his head as Amy proclaimed: “Remember—report any mistreatment to me!”

“Thank you, Lady Amy!”

“Our guardian angel!”

Departing amidst cheers, Guan Yu studied Amy anew. “Is this really the same girl?” he wondered.

**Chapter 1260: Prodigy**

Watching them leave, Kaiser seethed inwardly. “Little witch… When Lord Locke moves, you’ll regret this.”

En route, Guan Yu reflected on his duel. That crimson slash nearing his forehead had triggered an epiphany—without elemental infusion, even superior techniques remained hollow.

Magic’s essence lay in environmental manipulation. Each technique filtered specific elements, their alchemical fusion multiplying power. Guan Yu’s blockage stemmed from chaotic internal elements—metal, wood, water, fire, earth, light, darkness—all clashing unordered.

“Dragonkin brother! We’re here!”

Before them loomed an extraordinary forest—towering ancient trees veiling secrets. “This camouflage?” Guan Yu muttered. “Must elves hide everything?”

Beyond the arboreal curtain sprawled a colossal clearing dwarfing the basic training grounds, sparsely populated by elite mages.

“These few hundred are our finest,” Amy whispered. “All temperamental seniors. Tread carefully—I can’t protect you here. But I’ll try!”

“Their levels?”

“Mostly Archmages. The worst is that odious Locke.”

Guan Yu started. “Locke? A Magus?” Such prowess explained the elf’s ambition. In Guan Yu’s world, this equated to Soul Projection realm—surpassing his Nascent Soul stage.

“Damn. Facing such a rival fresh in this world…” Yet challenge ignited his competitive spirit.

A cold voice interrupted. “Sneaking in, are we?”

Turning, Guan Yu faced a lanky, aloof elf. Amy forced cheer. “Hello, Mulin! We’re visiting properly!”

Mulin ignored Guan Yu’s introduction. As they proceeded, Guan Yu noted with unease—he’d failed to sense Mulin’s approach.

“Master,” resonated a mental voice—Kingston awoke. “These elites could accelerate your magical growth.”

Anticipation surged. Here lay the crucible to forge new power.
