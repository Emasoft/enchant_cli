Zhang Chao glared at Guan Yu and Wen Qing with gnashed teeth, his eyes burning with fury. “Looking to die? You’re really asking for death! Get them! Kill these little bastards!” he spat coldly, pulling a cigarette from his pocket and lowering his head to light it.

Just as Zhang Chao’s men behind him began to move, Tian Hao—standing behind Guan Yu—clapped his hands and swung his arm.

With a sudden rustle, over twenty uniformed freshmen surged from the crowd, each wielding chair legs or iron pipes, encircling Zhang Chao and his group.

“Pathetic fools… A bunch of stinking students think they can fight us?” sneered the tall man behind Zhang Chao, stepping forward to strike.

Zhang Chao hastily grabbed his arm, eyeing the hostile crowd warily. “What’s this? Trying to outnumber us? Listen up, you bastards! Let me make this clear: If any of you dare lay a finger on my brothers today, you and your families will end up crippled! No one escapes!”

The freshmen, who had been eager moments ago, now hesitated. After all, threats against their families struck a nerve.

Seeing his intimidation work, Zhang Chao lit his cigarette and smirked at Guan Yu. “And you… punk. Cross me? Challenge me? Just wait for the bad news about your parents and siblings!” With a violent flick, he hurled the lit cigarette at Guan Yu.

“Attack!” Zhang Chao roared.

The threats had indeed rattled the encircling freshmen. They exchanged uneasy glances, their initial courage wavering under the weight of fear for their families.

These were, after all, first-year students unaccustomed to such violence—mere teenagers thrust into a standoff against men in their twenties. The bravado of numbers had emboldened them, but threats to their loved ones cast a shadow of doubt.

Niu Le, however, grinned and crooked a finger. “Come at me! My whole family’s sharpening knives at home waiting for you! Think you’re tough? Grandpa’s here to play!” He lunged forward, but Guan Yu yanked him back with a shake of his head.

“Leave them out of this. Aim your grudges at me,” Guan Yu said calmly.

As Guan Yu rolled up his sleeves to engage, Du Xiaojuan rushed over, her cheeks flushed and breath ragged.

“Guan Yu… Are you okay? What’s happening?” she asked, clutching his arm anxiously.

The crowd stared curiously at Du Xiaojuan. Zhang Chao’s eyes glinted hungrily at her delicate beauty. “What a pretty little thing…”

“Why are you here? Step aside—it’s not safe,” Guan Yu ordered gently, worried she might get hurt.

Wen Qing frowned, eyeing Du Xiaojuan suspiciously. “Du Xiaojuan… Are you close with him?”

Du Xiaojuan shot her a disdainful glance, snorted, and turned away—clearly aware of the rumors about Guan Yu and Wen Qing circulating on campus.

As tension simmered between the two beauties, Liu Shilei appeared behind Guan Yu.

“Guan Yu… What’s all this? Another fight?” she chided sternly.

“Shilei-jie, why are you here?” Guan Yu sighed inwardly. Was this a gathering? The fight hadn’t even started, yet women kept flocking over.

Liu Shilei glanced at Wen Qing and Du Xiaojuan with displeasure. “Return to class! Didn’t you learn from the Jin Cheng incident?” she whispered urgently.

Guan Yu sighed. “Stay back and watch,” he said to the women before locking eyes with Zhang Chao.

Zhang Chao leered at the three stunning women around Guan Yu. “Who knew you were such a ladies’ man? Take your romance elsewhere—I’d hate to ruin such pretty faces. Call off your ‘brave’ friends too. Who here dares strike? Step forward, boys!” he taunted, hands on hips.

Before the echoes of his mockery faded, Niu Le erupted. He yanked a gleaming machete from his bag and charged.

*Thwack!* A crimson mist sprayed from Zhang Chao’s scalp as the blade struck.

“Afraid to hit you? I’ll send you to hell today, you bastard!” Niu Le roared, dropping his bag and seizing Zhang Chao’s collar for another strike.

But a bald man behind Zhang Chao—moving like a kangaroo—sprang forward and kicked Niu Le’s hip, sending him staggering.

“Brother Chao, you okay?” The man glared furiously at Niu Le, his bushy eyebrows bristling.

No one had expected Niu Le’s lightning attack. Even the seasoned bodyguards reacted too late.

Niu Le straightened, eyes bloodshot. He pointed his blade at the bald man. “You’re next!” He lunged again.

In a flash, their bodies collided. Two heavy punches smashed Niu Le’s face, blood gushing from his nose and mouth.

As Guan Yu moved to intervene, Niu Le—seemingly numb to pain—locked his left arm around the man’s neck and plunged his machete into the man’s gut.

*Schlick!* The blade tore free, splattering blood. Niu Le glared down at the man pinned against his chest, his own blood dripping onto the man’s forehead.

**Chapter 321: Kneeling in a Row**

The blade had sunk deep. Though the man twisted to avoid vital organs, the machete’s razor edge sliced through his autumn clothes effortlessly.

Gritting through pain, the man drove an elbow into Niu Le’s chest. Instead of loosening his grip, Niu Le tightened his chokehold, nearly suffocating him.

As the elbow struck, Niu Le wrenched the blade free and swung it back in a wide arc, burying it into the man’s abdomen again. Blood soaked through clothes and pooled beneath them.

This wasn’t a narrow dagger—the machete’s seven-centimeter-wide blade ripped gaping wounds. Two strikes turned the man into a blood fountain.

Trapped in Niu Le’s grip, the man’s eyes widened with primal fear. Death loomed—one more strike would finish him. Though a veteran of countless brawls, he’d never felt death’s breath so sharply.

He tried to beg for mercy, but Niu Le’s chokehold stifled all sound. His body went limp, surrender written in every muscle.

Most would’ve relented. Not Niu Le. He stabbed again.

“Just die already!” Niu Le snarled, blood spraying from his nostrils like a grotesque fountain. The metallic tang of blood thickened the air.

The man’s eyes rolled back as he collapsed, awaiting the end.

The entire clash lasted mere seconds. Both sides stood frozen—Zhang Chao’s men smug until Niu Le’s first strike, then stunned into inaction.

Guan Yu reacted first, lunging to seize Niu Le’s wrist mid-swing.

“Brother, let go! Let me finish this scum!” Niu Le growled through bloodied teeth.

“Enough!” Guan Yu barked, healing energy flickering in his left hand as he wiped blood from Niu Le’s face.

“Release him.”

Niu Le spat crimson. “Weakling.” He shoved the limp body aside and brandished his blade at Zhang Chao’s group. “Who’s next?!”

Silence. Guan Yu accepted tissues from Wen Qing, wiping his hands clean before tossing the bloodied wad aside.

“Line up. Kneel in a row,” he said flatly, pointing at Zhang Chao.

“Kneel? Kneel to your mother!” Zhang Chao roared, face purpling.

Before the words faded, Guan Yu blurred forward. A bone-crunching uppercut snapped Zhang Chao’s head back, dropping him unconscious.

The remaining black-clad men exchanged panicked glances. None dared resist.

“Kneel!” Guan Yu commanded.

“Kneel, damn you!” Tian Hao smashed a pipe across a thug’s face, igniting a frenzy. Freshmen swarmed, weapons raining down until the men crumpled into a kneeling line.

**Chapter 322: “Husband, You’re Amazing”**

“I said a straight line! Deaf?!” Niu Le bellowed. Another volley of blows forced the disheveled row into alignment.

Guan Yu watched coldly as the freshmen disciplined their captives—striking shoulders and backs, avoiding lethal blows. Unlike Niu Le’s unrestrained fury, their strikes held restraint.

“Brother… You fought again?”

Guan Yu turned to find Zhao Jing’er watching timidly.

“Why are *you* here?” He groaned inwardly, catching Liu Shilei’s disapproving glare.

“Grandpa’s guards called. They asked if you need help. Should I let them handle this?” Jing’er murmured softly.

Realization dawned—Zhao’s grandfather had assigned covert protectors.

“Would that trouble them?”

“Not at all. They’re eager to assist.”

“Perfect. Take these thugs away. Get the wounded to hospitals.” Guan Yu nodded toward the gut-stabbed man, whose injuries—while severe—weren’t fatal.

Jing’er made a call. Within a minute, a military van arrived.

A sharp-featured young man in black tactical gear approached. “Guan Yu? I’m Yang Zhensheng. At your service.”

Guan Yu gestured to the captives. “Trouble with these troublemakers. Will the police complicate things?”

“Leave it to us. Just call anytime.” Yang handed a card to Jing’er before signaling his team to load the bloodied men.

As the van departed, Guan Yu exhaled, the scent of iron still clinging to the air.
