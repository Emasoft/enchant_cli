“Unlikely. The old fogies of Yunqing Sect have no dealings with the Demon Clan. How would they comprehend the demonic script? I think it’s impossible.”

“One cannot be certain. Moreover, we must thoroughly study the meaning of what’s written there. We must find the second volume of the Eight-Sided Drum Art before anyone else. We absolutely cannot let others seize this opportunity first.” The Demon Lord declared, “It seems Patriarch Menghua indeed had connections with the Demon Clan a millennium ago. His journals record interpretations of the demonic script. Otherwise, we wouldn’t understand the clues either.”

Wang Xiaorong remarked, “Father, the lines ‘Beneath the Golden City, upon Divine Stone Mountain; When blossoms bloom, fragrant winds carry afar; Divine Art shall manifest’—the third and fourth lines seem clear. ‘When blossoms bloom’ surely refers to summer, when flowers flourish most vigorously. We must wait until summer to find it.”

“Though plausible, the first two lines remain most cryptic. Spring has just begun, and many flowers bloom in this season too. We cannot confirm it exclusively refers to summer.”

The Demon Lord continued, “Only by deciphering the first two lines to locate the described place can we find the Eight-Sided Drum Art. If we wait until blossoms appear to search, it’ll be too late.”

“True, but ‘Beneath the Golden City, upon Divine Stone Mountain’ remains vague. We cannot unravel their meaning quickly.” Wang Xiaorong sighed.

“This matter requires patient study. I shall revisit Patriarch Menghua’s journals. Left Envoy—from now on, intensify surveillance on Yunqing Sect. Report every movement immediately. Understood?”

“As you command, Demon Lord.”

The Demon Lord stood, sighing heavily. “That Guan Yu obtained the Eight-Sided Drum... Fate works mysteriously. A dual cultivator of martial and demonic arts, now wielding this peerless technique—soon he’ll become a legend. Yunqing Sect will reign unchallenged in the martial world.”

“Unacceptable. We cannot let Guan Yu develop unimpeded. He’ll become our greatest threat. Once his wings harden, it’ll be too late to act.” The Demon Lord pondered.

**Chapter 3559: A Brilliant Idea**

“Left Envoy, leak word to our agents. Spread rumors across the martial world that Guan Yu, a Yunqing disciple, secretly studies demonic arts. Let this scandal grow as large as possible.”

Wang Xiaorong asked, “Father, what purpose does this serve? How does it harm Guan Yu?”

“Perhaps nothing, perhaps everything.” The Demon Lord explained, “Yunqing’s elders prize reputation above all—they’ve lived for prestige. Moreover, they’re selfish. The Eight-Sided Drum Art belongs to demonic orthodoxy. How could they permit their disciple to practice it? This scandal will force them to punish Guan Yu.

“A Yunqing disciple cultivating demonic arts shames their sect. To eliminate future gossip, they might strip his cultivation and expel him.”

Wang Xiaorong’s eyes sparkled. “Truly? How wonderful! Then we could recruit Guan Yu into our Demon Soul Sect, gaining a dual-cultivation expert!”

“Wishful thinking. If expelled, Guan Yu would be a cripple. What use is a wasted man to us?”

“Ah! Would they... kill him?” she gasped.

“Uncertain. Yunqing’s actions depend on Guan Yu’s defense.”

**Chapter 3560: The Journey**

At dawn, Guan Yu’s group assembled. He hadn’t slept, instead meditating on the surging energy within—likely the Eight-Sided Drum Art breaching his seals. Though his internal energy thickened, its reliability remained questionable. Spiritual power felt purer but unchanged.

Inspecting deeper, Guan Yu discovered a colossal force clashing against his mental seals. The Eight-Sided Drum’s energy loathed the seals, which reciprocated the animosity. This deadlock threatened explosive conflict—and his life.

“Cursed seals!” Guan Yu seethed. Each breakthrough opportunity ruined—first by the Merit Cauldron’s inheritance, now this. Yet with enhanced internal energy, he rode towards Yunqing Mountain.

At a roadside teahouse, disguised travelers rested. Four cloaked figures—Guan Yu, Xiao Zhi, Siqi, and Aze—drank quietly until hoofbeats announced a band of rough men.

“Hey! You lot!” A mountainous man bellowed. “Seen any Yunqing disciples?”

Xiao Zhi feigned ignorance. “None but yourselves, sir.”

As they departed, a lackey whispered, “Second Master—four travelers, four in their group...”

“Blast! After them!”

**Chapter 3561: Homecoming**

Galloping ahead on superior steeds, Guan Yu’s group outran pursuers. Rumors of his demonic arts and treasures now plagued every road.

“No more stops. Straight to Yunqing,” Guan Yu urged.

Xiao Zhi worried, “How will you explain this at the sect?”

“Explain what? I’ve practiced no demonic arts. The truth will prevail.”

Siqi defended, “These are demonic slanders to trouble us!”

Reaching Yunqing’s foothills, Guan Yu summoned the Falling Soul Blade—now enlarged for flight.

Xiao Zhi gaped. “Since when can you sword-ride?”

“Oh, I always could.” Guan Yu smirked, soaring upwards as his companions grumbled. The blade’s majestic form bore him aloft, a hero returning to storms awaiting.
