“Then let’s begin. I’ll go first.” The White Tiger spoke for the first time. Compared to the silence of the other two magical beasts, it appeared more proactive, its blazing eyes revealing an unfathomable depth and anticipation.

“Please…”

Guan Yu said nothing more. Man and beast stood facing each other, their auras solidifying.

“Old Wolf, this sect leader has some skill. Though he seems inexperienced, his aura doesn’t falter against the tiger. That alone makes him noteworthy.” The Earthfiend Bear, though gruff and straightforward, was no fool. He admired strength above all else.

“In the world of beastkind, everything is decided by might. To avoid becoming slaves, our greatest priority is to shed our beastly identities. I will never relinquish this chance for bloodline evolution. What say you, Old Bear?” The Howling Sun Sky Wolf’s tone was soft, but the resolve within was clear to his long-time companion.

“If he can withstand—or even defeat—the White Tiger, following him wouldn’t be unacceptable.” The Earthfiend Bear had always revered the White Tiger’s strength, having been defeated by it himself.

On the open ground ahead, Guan Yu and the White Tiger had already exchanged several blows. Two sword marks now marred the tiger’s right forepaw, while Guan Yu had been sent flying by a vicious swipe of its tail. Though unharmed, the momentary stumble gave the White Tiger an opening.

“Roar—!”

The tiger’s roar shook the mountains. A tempest surged as a terrifying energy coalesced in Guan Yu’s vision—the prelude to the White Tiger’s innate divine ability.

Geng Metal energy gathered in the sky. The White Tiger, aligned with metal and slaughter, might not be pure-blooded, but its techniques were no less formidable.

The innate spirit of Geng Metal condensed into a colossal golden tiger that roared and lunged at Guan Yu. Whirling blades of metallic energy shredded trees, grass, and even stones as they spun through the air. Guan Yu’s expression turned grave; he had never underestimated these beasts.

“Impressive display, but hollow. Break!” A flash of violet-blue light erupted from Guan Yu’s hand, spreading a blazing net that ensnared the golden tiger. The sizzling of melting metal filled the air as Guan Yu’s sword flickered again.

A vermilion phoenix cried out, diving toward the trapped beast.

“Fire-based divine ability? Not good—” The Howling Sun Sky Wolf stiffened, while the Earthfiend Bear charged forward. A yellow glow enveloped the White Tiger, shielding it with earthen energy.

Yet both beasts froze mid-step, staring in dread at the figure hovering above. Only when they drew near did they feel the crushing pressure radiating from Guan Yu—a force that weighed on their bones, blood, and organs, immobilizing them as if trapped in quicksand.

*Clang—!*

A violet sword pierced the yellow shield, halting at the White Tiger’s forehead. In an instant, the battle was decisively lost.

Though elemental advantage played a role, Guan Yu’s overwhelming prowess was undeniable. The Howling Sun Sky Wolf and Earthfiend Bear knew their own outcomes would have been no different.

“I yield. White Tiger pays respects to the Sect Leader…” The tiger’s surrender carried both resignation and relief.

“Enough. Howling Sun pays respects to the Sect Leader…”

“Earth Bear pays respects to the Sect Leader…”

The three beasts knelt in unison—a scene even Qin Wuliang hadn’t anticipated concluding so swiftly.

“Tiger, did you hold back?” The Howling Sun Sky Wolf eyed its companion skeptically, knowing the White Tiger possessed more innate abilities than displayed.

“Yes… and no.” The White Tiger paused, offering no further explanation.

“I see…” The wolf’s gaze turned contemplative before it withdrew.

“Sect Leader, this is the entrance to the herb garden. None of us understand formation arrays, so we’ve never breached it.” The Earthfiend Bear led them to a site within its territory.

“Elder Qin, what do you think?” Guan Yu’s tension was palpable. Their quest for the Crimson Flame Blood Mushroom to save Wild Crane True Person’s life hinged on this garden.

“The formation has been active for centuries. The original master of this ruin was a formation grandmaster. Even with damaged earth veins, it self-sustained until now. Placing spirit stones here should suffice.” Qin Wuliang tossed seven low-grade stones into the array with precise arcs.

A violet flash revealed a five-meter-wide teleportation circle.

“Step aboard. It can carry ten.” Qin Wuliang entered first.

Upon reappearing, Guan Yu gaped at the sight: a ten-mile valley shimmered with crimson light, filled with rare herbs, fluttering butterflies, and bees. A ginseng root resembling a purple infant peeked from the soil.

“Is that… a *ten-thousand-year ginseng*?” Guan Yu’s voice trembled.

“A mere trifle here.” Qin Wuliang chuckled. “The Crimson Flame Blood Mushrooms lie yonder. After centuries sealed, all herbs here are ripe for harvest.”

Guarded by formations easily dismantled by Qin Wuliang, they collected samples, leaving younger plants and seeds for future cultivation.

Six months later, Guan Yu returned to the mortal world. Breathing the sparse spiritual air, he felt an odd comfort before vanishing toward White Cloud Temple to deliver the True Condensation Pill.

Yet trouble awaited.

“Come out. Still itching for a fight?” Guan Yu’s icy gaze pierced the shadows, revealing two black-clad figures.

“Our young master invites you to a banquet in Ninghai. Will you honor us?” The envoys trembled under his glare.

Three hours later, Guan Yu stood before a villa, greeted by Yin Qianji.

“Brother Yin. To what do I owe this… *hospitality*?” Guan Yu’s smile was frosty.

“The earlier conflict… was my sect’s order. I apologize.” Yin Qianji bowed.

“Skip the platitudes. State your purpose.”

“Your gains from the ruins… might our prior trade proposal still stand?”

“I’ll auction the spoils. Host the event, and I’ll forget past grievances.” Guan Yu tossed him a list and departed.

On the flight home, Guan Yu pondered the future. At White Cloud Temple, he collapsed into Liu Shilei’s embrace, exhaustion overwhelming him.

“Rest, my love. We’ll walk this path together,” she whispered, lulling him to sleep with gentle light.

Fifteen blissful days later, Guan Yu stood atop White Cloud Temple’s Sunrise Platform with Master Wild Crane.

“Congratulations, Master, on mending your dao foundation. The heavenly tribulation will surely be conquered.”

“Five days hence, I’ll face the tribulation here. Send the invitations.”

Guan Yu bowed. After the ordeal, he would gift his master a final surprise—one that would alter the sect’s destiny.
