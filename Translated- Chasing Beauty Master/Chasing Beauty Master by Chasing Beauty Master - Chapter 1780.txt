“Staying here for a year is out of the question,” declared the Right Envoy. There were still many matters awaiting her attention outside. Moreover, among these disciples of the Demon Soul Sect, though all were individuals of status, some remained under the control of Blood Toxin. They required monthly antidotes.

The Right Envoy did not carry such a large quantity of antidotes. If they were truly trapped here for a year, the Demon Soul Sect members present would likely descend into chaos—the outbreak of Blood Toxin was no trivial matter.

She had no intention of remaining here with these people. Besides, the opposing side was numerous and powerful. Staying would only invite trouble.

“You’re right. Time is short—we shouldn’t waste it here.” The Right Envoy turned abruptly, waving her hand as she commanded, “Everyone, search for the exit at full speed until it’s found! Even if it takes a year, locate that exit!”

Guanyu chuckled softly. *This Right Envoy truly has character*, he mused. Earlier, he had mentioned potentially spending a year searching for clues to the Eight-Sided Drum Technique, and now she had ordered her subordinates to devote a year to finding the exit. *She’s certainly an inventive one.*

With the Demon Soul Sect departed, Guanyu turned and announced, “Now that I’ve cleverly diverted the Demon Soul Sect, you two factions may resume your contest. The Bloodstone in my possession shall belong to the final victor. As for how you choose to fight—I’ll merely observe.”

Tension crackled between the Crimson Lotus Sect and the True Sun Sect. Elder Zhao of the Crimson Lotus Sect was the most unwilling to relent. If this Bloodstone could be brought back and refined into a high-grade magic artifact, it would significantly enhance the sect’s overall strength.

High-grade artifacts were not easily obtained, and such a large Bloodstone held immense potential. For the Crimson Lotus Sect’s sake, securing it would serve as compensation for failing to locate the Eight-Sided Drum Technique.

At least, it seemed no one had found the technique—a small consolation. *If we couldn’t obtain it, neither could others.* Elder Zhao fixed a piercing gaze on the True Sun Sect, his stance unyielding.

At that moment, the True Sun Sect’s elder raised a hand and spoke first: “In truth, we should thank Guanyu. Had his smooth-talking not driven the Demon Soul Sect away, we’d still be locked in bitter combat. However, I’ve no objection to continuing our struggle now.

“Yet the Demon Soul Sect may not have gone far. If they detect ongoing conflict here, they’ll surely return. Guanyu also mentioned our ‘unity.’ For everyone’s safety, it’s best to wait.”

Elder Zhao conceded the logic, but nightfall approached swiftly. Once darkness descended, opportunities for action would vanish.

“The True Sun Sect’s strength is indeed formidable,” Elder Zhao began, offering measured praise. “I know prolonged fighting over this Bloodstone would leave both sides crippled. Victory would hinge on who endures longest—but the cost would be dire. Perhaps we might... settle this through an alternative contest?”

“Oh? Propose your method, Elder Zhao,” replied the True Sun elder.

Elder Zhao understood the True Sun Sect would never relinquish the Bloodstone. Discovered jointly, it belonged to neither party—hence the prolonged struggle.

Initially, the Crimson Lotus and True Sun elders had agreed to collaborate in searching for the Eight-Sided Drum Technique—a suggestion from Elder Zhao, who well understood the power of unity.

Moreover, the Crimson Lotus Sect had been ravaged by the Demon Soul Sect. Elder Zhao’s spiritual energy was depleted; another encounter would not end as luckily as before.

Thus, under the guise of cooperation, he had persuaded the True Sun Sect to join forces. United, they could better withstand Demon Soul ambushes. Yet upon discovering the Bloodstone here, disputes erupted, battles ensued.

Elder Zhao proposed: “Let us compare our wealth—not in gold, but in treasures. As cultivation elders, we surely carry rare artifacts. Whoever possesses superior treasures claims the Bloodstone. This avoids further bloodshed and keeps the Demon Soul Sect at bay.”

His motives were hardly pure. The True Sun Sect’s reclusive existence stemmed from meager resources—forced to skulk in shadows, engaging in shady dealings for survival. Their elders likely owned few valuables. During earlier clashes, none had produced notable artifacts. Confident in his sect’s superiority, Elder Zhao aimed to humiliate them publicly.

Guanyu saw through this immediately. *If I were the True Sun elder, lacking treasures, I’d refuse outright rather than face ridicule and lose face for my sect.*

**Chapter 4657: I Agree**

The True Sun elder recognized the trap. The Crimson Lotus assumed poverty forced their seclusion, leaving them treasureless. Among major sects, the Cloud Azure Sect stood richest, boasting legendary artifacts like the Hidden Dragon Sword and Merit Cauldron. The Crimson Lotus hoarded treasures like the Myriad Symbol Disc and Jade Eight Trigrams, while the True Sun’s vaults remained shrouded in mystery—feeding assumptions of destitution.

All awaited the True Sun elder’s response. Guanyu watched curiously, unwilling to intervene in external sect affairs.

“Though I carry little this time... I accept,” the elder declared. “This spares our disciples harm. The proposal has merit.”

Elder Zhao’s eyes lit with triumph. *The fool agreed! The Bloodstone is ours!*

“Splendid! Let us reveal our treasures.” Elder Zhao produced a scroll—his primary artifact, a thin parchment resembling aged hide veined with crimson patterns. “This ‘Scroll’ stores vast spiritual energy. A mid-grade artifact approaching high-grade. What say you?”

Guanyu snorted. “Mid-grade at best. Calling it high-grade insults intelligence. This ‘treasure’ lacks even a flicker of spiritual energy now—scarcely better than toilet paper.”

“You understand nothing!” Elder Zhao retorted. “Its energy was expended activating the ‘Escape Gate’—a lifesaving spell that teleports allies. The cost? Draining all stored energy. After battling the Right Envoy, I had no choice!”

“So it’s now a worthless husk,” Guanyu taunted. “Until recharged, it’s trash—by your own admission.”

The True Sun elder remained silent, tacitly agreeing.

Fuming, Elder Zhao retrieved another item—a bamboo flute embedded with six pale gems. “This ‘Flute of Six Harmonies’ channels elemental forces through its gems. A true high-grade artifact!”

Guanyu inspected it skeptically. “Ordinary bamboo with cheap stones. Hardly impressive.”

**Chapter 4658: Fleeing**

Elder Zhao’s face purpled with rage. Meanwhile, Guanyu noted the descending sun. *Soon, we’ll be transported out. Once gone, I’ll seize the Bloodstone and vanish. Let the sects battle the waiting Demon Soul hordes—they’ll be too occupied to chase me.*

The True Sun elder finally spoke: “Your artifacts pale against mine.” From his sleeve, he withdrew a small, unassuming bronze mirror. Its surface rippled like water. “The ‘Void Reflection Mirror’—a high-grade artifact capable of trapping souls and reversing attacks. Do you dare test it?”

Elder Zhao paled. The mirror’s reputation preceded it—a relic thought lost centuries ago. Before he could respond, the world shimmered.

“Transportation’s beginning!” Guanyu shouted, clutching the Bloodstone. “Farewell, elders!”

As the scenery blurred, he glimpsed their furious faces. Laughing, Guanyu vanished—the Bloodstone secure, chaos erupting behind him.
