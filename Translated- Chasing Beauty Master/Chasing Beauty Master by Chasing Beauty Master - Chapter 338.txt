“Life’s many experiences taught Wenya to love herself, but she loved herself too much. She lived in her own emotional world, refusing to let any other man enter.

But now, Guanyu’s sudden appearance had thrown her emotional world into chaos. Especially after Guanyu shifted the blame to the aphrodisiac, Wenya’s heart felt as if gripped by an invisible hand, suffocating her.

She hated men who lacked responsibility and played with women’s feelings.

At this moment, her heart died—or rather, her heart died to men. She resolved to lock away her emotions forever, never allowing another man to trespass.

Provoked by Wenya’s unreasonable scolding, Guanyu’s temper flared. But when Wenya’s tears streamed down her pale cheeks and dripped onto his chest, his anger vanished.

He lowered his eyelids, falling into brief silence.

Was Wenya wrong? No. Life had molded her into this. Her beauty made it hard to discern true intentions from false ones.

Last night’s absurdity shattered her last shred of hope for love.

Guanyu sighed, releasing her wrists and gently wiping her tears. ‘How about becoming my woman?’

Wenya answered with action.

The moment he let go, she bit his shoulder, blood mingling with tears flowing down his collarbone.

She refused to release him, as if determined to bite him to death.

Guanyu grimaced in pain but allowed her to vent—he deserved it.

After all, he’d taken her precious first time.

Wenya hated him for it.

Guanyu tolerated her tantrum but hadn’t anticipated her stubbornness.

Minutes passed, her teeth sinking deeper into his flesh.

Annoyed, Guanyu slapped her bare buttocks. ‘Choose: keep biting or let me admire your春光?’

Wenya panicked, stood abruptly, hitting her head on the roof.

Guanyu smirked, his gaze roaming her naked form—her flawless skin, curves like art, breasts swaying,刺激his eyes.

Her beauty was angelic.

Guanyu’s arousal strained his boxers.

Wenya, flustered, scrambled to cover herself, searching for clothes.

She wished for a hole to vanish into.

That morning, she’d hoped it was a dream—but reality left her exposed to Guanyu’s gaze.

‘Get up!’ she hissed, covering herself.

‘What?’

‘Leave! You’ve seen enough!’

Guanyu handed her panties. ‘Yours. I used them as a pillow.’

Wenya snatched them, furious. ‘Get out!’

Guanyu left, half-dressed and embarrassed.

‘Damn it!’ he muttered outside.

After clearing debris, he returned to find Wenya dressing.

Her torn shirt revealed glimpses of flesh.

‘I’ll buy you clothes,’ he offered.

‘No,’ she spat.

At the hospital, Guanyu urged, ‘See your mother. She’s worried.’

Wenya left, ignoring him.

Later, he returned with designer clothes.

‘Choose one. No one’ll see you change.’

Reluctantly, she dressed in the car, unaware Guanyu watched.

At her mother’s ward, tensions flared.

‘He’s not human!’ Wenya cried.

But a nurse arrived, announcing an upgrade to a VIP suite and delivering luxury clothes.

Stunned, her mother praised Guanyu.

‘He’s your perfect match!’

Wenya, conflicted, left in tears.

Guanyu followed, determined to claim her.

Thus unfolded the tragedy of their tangled fates.
