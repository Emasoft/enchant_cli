“They’re upstairs, locked in the room! Otherwise, those guys would’ve fought us to the death! Out of respect for Boss Guan and Boss Luo, we couldn’t throw punches. But we couldn’t just stand there taking hits either. So we locked all three inside and ran out first!” Old Han said with a bitter smile, rubbing his forehead with frustration.

The situation was indeed humiliating. Imagine fleeing their own base with over a dozen men, chased out by just three opponents, leaving the entire place to them!

“Upstairs?” Guan Yu stepped forward, glancing upward with a tilt of his head.

“I’ll go check. Don’t worry, Old Han—I’ll make sure you get proper compensation for this,” Guan Yu declared solemnly, striding upstairs with Luo Cheng and others.

Old Han hurried after them, forcing an awkward smile. “Boss Luo and I go way back—no need for formal apologies! Let’s just avoid misunderstandings over this trifle. After all, we’re all just trying to make a living here. Though it’s not exactly respectable work, everything’s voluntary—no forced prostitution or—”

Guan Yu chuckled, patting Old Han’s shoulder. “I understand. My friend here drank too much and acted foolishly. I’ll take him away now. Tomorrow, when he’s sober, I’ll drag him back to apologize personally. We’ll cover all damages.”

“No need, really!” Old Han waved his hands humbly. In their world, mutual respect ruled—Guan Yu’s graciousness made Old Han feel honored. The earlier resentment caused by Niu Le’s rampage had already vanished.

“This door here!” Old Han pulled Guan Yu’s arm toward a reinforced security door.

Even through the door, Guan Yu clearly heard the cacophony of objects being smashed inside.

“They can’t open it from inside?” Guan Yu asked curiously.

“I locked the inner bolt,” Old Han shrugged helplessly.

Unlocking the door, light spilled out to reveal the wreckage—overturned sofas, shattered TV and aquarium. The living room stood empty.

“Probably exhausted themselves smashing things and went to rest inside,” Old Han muttered gloomily.

Surveying the devastation, Guan Yu shook his head guiltily. He tested the fortified inner door’s lock—a fist-sized padlock secured the secondary metal gate. Such precautions in this temporary den allowed occupants time to dress during police raids.

After Old Han unlocked it, he dismissed his underlings and the working girls: “Head downstairs and check the main shop.”

“But Boss Han…” A bald youth hesitated, clearly concerned about leaving him alone.

“Go on—it’s fine,” Old Han waved dismissively. Guan Yu’s small entourage showed peaceful intentions, and with Niu Le’s group contained, he felt safe enough.

“Wait,” Guan Yu suddenly called, eyeing the fashionable women. “Which one’s Yuanyuan? Stay here.”

Old Han blinked in confusion until Guan Yu smirked: “What? Think I’ll—”

“No!” Old Han cut him off, pointing to a petite girl with apple-round cheeks. “Yuanyuan, remain.”

Guan Yu silently gestured the group inside. “Niu Le!” he barked, hands on hips.

From an inner bedroom came heavy panting, then scrambling noises. Reeking of alcohol, Niu Le stumbled out: “B-brother Yu? How’d you…?” Sobering instantly, he dreaded the impending scolding.

“Out!” Guan Yu ordered again.

Emerging shamefaced, Niu Le mumbled: “Brother Yu, why’re you here?”

“How much did you drink?” Guan Yu demanded. Niu Le glared resentfully at Old Han but stayed silent.

“Trying to demolish the place? Why stop at smashing—why not burn it down?” Guan Yu thrust a lighter forward. “Go ahead! Torch it!”

Niu Le grimaced: “Brother Yu, I—”

“You idiot!” Guan Yu jabbed the lighter against his forehead. “Smashing this den won’t stop prostitution! She could work elsewhere—streets, online! Burn every brothel? You’d need to eliminate all men first!”

When Niu Le glanced defiantly at Old Han, Guan Yu snorted: “Think closing this place saves her?” He dragged forward the trembling Yuanyuan. “Is this your beloved? Ask if she wants saving!”

“I…I didn’t think…” Niu Le stammered.

“Exactly! You want her? Then support her fully!” Guan Yu challenged. “Marry her! Manage her finances so she quits!”

Yuanyuan flushed with humiliation. “Who’d want him? He actually believed our bar fling meant something!”

Niu Le reddened: “I didn’t know she was a working girl!”

“Oh please!” Yuanyuan sneered. “I earn 50k monthly lying down—could you afford me?”

“You bitch!” Niu Le roared. “How dare disrespect Brother Yu!”

“You weren’t so brave when licking my—”

“Enough!” Guan Yu interrupted, torn between laughter and exasperation. “Leaving with your ‘darling’ or coming quietly?”

“With you…” Niu Le mumbled, then blurted: “Damn woman! Should’ve worn a gas mask dealing with your stench!”

The room erupted in suppressed laughter. Guan Yu sighed: “Let’s go.”

Turning to Old Han, Guan Yu vowed compensation and next-day apologies. Driving back, he prodded Niu Le: “Explain yourself.”

“Didn’t know she’s a prostitute!”

“Bar girls aren’t wife material!” Guan Yu lectured. “Never take them seriously!”

Niu Le smirked: “Says the guy who took that knockout from Yunnan home?”

Guan Yu choked on his words—hypocrisy exposed.
