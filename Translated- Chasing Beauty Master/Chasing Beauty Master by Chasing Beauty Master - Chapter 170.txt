His expression darkened instantly. He had not expected to encounter Guan Yu here. Yesterday's humiliation had been the greatest he'd ever suffered in his life. How could he swallow this insult? He vowed to make Guan Yu remember him forever.

"A gentleman’s revenge is never too late, even after ten years." But not now.

After yesterday's disgrace, he had calmed considerably. Upon returning, he immediately conducted a thorough investigation into Guan Yu and Zhao Jing'er.

The investigation revealed Guan Yu was merely an art student from the countryside—not even qualified to be his opponent.

However, Zhao Jing'er's identity shocked Yang Yang profoundly. She turned out to be the granddaughter of Zhao Zilong, a founding hero of the nation. This status alone made her someone to be deeply wary of.

Though the Yang family's influence was formidable, confronting Zhao Zilong would result in mutually destructive consequences, which contradicted their interests.

Thus, they resolved to endure the humiliation—for now.

But Yang Yang would never let Guan Yu off the hook. A mere college student?

He couldn’t fathom how Guan Yu had become entangled with Zhao Jing'er. Without her protection, crushing Guan Yu would be child’s play.

Yang Yang had carefully calculated his move. He doubted Zhao Zilong would risk open conflict with the Yangs over an insignificant student—there was no benefit for the old hero.

He now waited for the moment Guan Yu would be expelled from Zhongnanhai. Then everything would fall into place. He could already envision stomping Guan Yu beneath his feet.

A sinister smile crept across Yang Yang’s lips.

The elderly man practicing Tai Chi nearby observed Yang Yang’s shifting expressions with a faint frown but continued his fluid movements undisturbed.

**Chapter 419: Sudden Illness**

Yang Yang quickly composed himself, turning to the old man with an apologetic smile. “Grandpa Wen, I was distracted by an acquaintance. Forgive this young man’s impulsiveness.”

Wen Shuquan remained silent, his Tai Chi unbroken.

Yang Yang forced a smile and changed the subject. “Grandpa Wen, I’ve brought you premium Longjing tea harvested before the rains. I’ll fetch it for you later.”

“Hmm. Thank Yang Lao for me,” Wen replied tersely.

Yang Yang knew to stop there. He aimed to impress Wen Shuquan through indirect means—especially since Wen’s granddaughter was returning to the capital soon. Regaining his poise, he resumed practicing Tai Chi.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu recalled Zhao Zilong’s warning about Yang’s underhanded tactics. His counterstrategy was simple: match cruelty with cruelty.

As Guan Yu jogged around the lake, his gaze drifted to the lively nurses attending the elderly statesmen. He smirked, musing how these old men enjoyed their twilight years.

Suddenly, two nurses rushed toward Yang Yang’s location. Wen Shuquan had collapsed mid-Tai Chi, Yang kneeling anxiously beside him.

The incident drew the crowd’s attention. Seasoned by decades of crises, the onlookers calmly dispatched nurses to fetch doctors while others tended to Wen.

Guan Yu approached, curious if he could assist.

“Nurse, what’s wrong with Old Wen?” someone asked urgently.

The flustered nurse shook her head. “There are no visible symptoms. We don’t know.”

An elder turned to Yang Yang. “Xiao Yang, carry him to his residence. The cold worsens his condition.”

Yang’s heart leapt at this opportunity to play savior, but as he moved to lift Wen, a voice thundered:

“Don’t touch him! You’ll endanger him further!” Guan Yu pushed through the crowd.

Yang glared. “Who are you to command us? The cold will kill him if we delay!”

Guan Yu countered coolly, “His heart rhythm is critically unstable. Moving him now could trigger cardiac arrest.”

Yang froze, torn between risk and opportunity. He dismissed Guan Yu’s warning—what could an art student know? The crowd shared his skepticism.

Yet the elder who’d spoken earlier studied Guan Yu. “Young man, if you recognize the symptoms, can you treat him?”

“I can stabilize him,” Guan Yu affirmed.

**Chapter 420: Awakening**

Murmurs rippled through the crowd. Without medical equipment, how?

Yang scoffed. “Every second counts. What if you’re wrong?”

Ignoring him, Guan Yu knelt beside Wen. When Yang blocked his path, Guan Yu snapped, “Move!”

Masking fury, Yang stepped aside with feigned courtesy. “Of course. We’re all concerned for Grandpa Wen.”

Guan Yu placed his hand over Wen’s heart, eyes closed. The crowd gasped as fabric sizzled beneath his palm, yet Wen’s skin remained unscathed.

Sweat beaded on Guan Yu’s pale face as vital energy surged through his touch. After an agonizing minute, he withdrew with a weary smile.

Wen Shuquan’s eyelids fluttered open.

“He’s awake! By heaven, he did it!” The elders stared at Guan Yu as if witnessing a miracle.

Yang’s triumphant grin stiffened into horrified disbelief.

**Chapter 421: Medical Prodigy?**

Wen sat up, bewildered. “Lao Jiang? What happened?”

Jiang Chao chuckled. “You nearly crossed over, old friend. Thank this young man.”

As the crowd buzzed with awe, Yang stood paralyzed, his scheme unraveling. Guan Yu’s ragged breathing and ashen complexion testified to the ordeal—but his steady gaze never wavered.

The elders exchanged meaningful glances. This unassuming youth had just rewritten their understanding of medicine.
