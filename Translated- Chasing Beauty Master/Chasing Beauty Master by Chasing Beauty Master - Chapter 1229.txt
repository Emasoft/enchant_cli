“This is how we ensure disciples take root and flourish within the sect, treating it as their true home. Only then can they serve wholeheartedly, for protecting the sect becomes akin to safeguarding their own family. Such bonds fortify their loyalty through generations.”

“The Yunqing Sect permits male disciples to bring women from outside, not restricting them to choosing wives solely from Convergence Peak. However, all outsiders must undergo rigorous scrutiny by the elders and Sect Leader to verify their backgrounds before any union is allowed.”

“Otherwise, should a disciple unwittingly bring in a demonic cultivator, it would be inviting wolves into the fold. No disciple from any peak may descend the mountain without explicit orders from their elders or the Sect Leader. Only designated individuals may leave for missions.”

“Thus, many who ascend the mountain never descend again. When rare opportunities arise for下山 missions, disciples compete fiercely for the chance to glimpse the mortal world’s temptations.”

“For male disciples confined to the peaks, Convergence Peak becomes their sole distraction—the only place with female disciples. Yet Elder Dai (Dark Brow), that stern matriarch, keeps them under watchful eyes.”

“Though Elder Dai’s gates remain perpetually sealed, male disciples still linger near Convergence Peak. Despite her severity, clandestine trysts between female disciples and youths from other peaks persist under moonlit shadows.”

“Elder Dai often turns a blind eye to minor transgressions. ‘Each follows their own path,’ she reasons. ‘No amount of discipline can force enlightenment upon them.’ Though a widow for centuries, she refuses to let her disciples share her fate. Yet their restless curiosity about the outside world leaves Convergence Peak bereft of promising talents—easily lured away by wandering youths from other peaks.”

**Chapter 3158: The Hundred-Meter Sprinter**

“A disciple as devoted as Siqi (Thoughtful Jade) is rare. Despite countless suitors vying for her attention, she remains impervious—eyes fixed on cultivation alone.”

“Those who overstep face her blade. With none among her peers matching her skill, Siqi has risen as Convergence Peak’s most gifted disciple, earning Elder Dai’s highest favor.”

“Elder Dai believes Siqi will restore Convergence Peak’s former glory and nurtures her progress with meticulous care.”

Guanyu walked flanked by three beauties, one being the Yunqing Mountains’ famed “Mountain Blossom”—a title Siqi had long held undisputed. None in the sect could rival her ethereal grace, making her the undisputed paragon of beauty.

Within Yunqing Sect, Siqi’s renown rivaled even the elders. Sect Leader Xuanming himself held her in exceptional regard.

As they traversed Tiger’s Crown Peak’s path, skirting the grand hall’s flank, they passed numerous disciples training late into the night—sparring, meditating, their dedication unyielding. Guanyu marveled, “These cultivators truly grind ceaselessly. Night and day, yet never wearied by monotony.”

Wherever Guanyu walked, his female entourage drew stares. Practicing disciples halted mid-motion; even meditators cracked open eyes to gawk.

Of course, their gazes lingered not on Guanyu but his companions. While Xiaochun (Little Spring) and Xiaolian (Little Lotus) were plain-faced, their mediocrity only accentuated Siqi’s transcendent allure—a vision that left male disciples breathless, eyes near bulging from sockets.

A distant figure suddenly sprinted toward them, waving frantically. “Siqi! Siqi! What brings you here?”

Guanyu focused—a Yunqing disciple in cyan robes closed the distance with startling speed, a veritable “hundred-meter sprinter” appearing before them in a blink.

The newcomer was young, slightly pudgy, with forgettable features—at least more presentable than Ling Su’s weaselly visage. Standing barely over five feet, his stubby legs defied logic with their swiftness.

“Siqi, what brings you here? Whatever you need, I’m your man!” he panted.

Siqi remained silent, icy indifference radiating. Xiaochun interjected, “Senior Brother Lin, we’re passing through to the back mountains under Sect Leader’s permission. If you’re free, join us!”

Her peach-shaped eyes betrayed infatuation with this “short gourd.” Guanyu wondered how such an unremarkable specimen dared pursue Siqi.

*A toad lusting after swan meat*, he mused. *Why not piss in a puddle and see your reflection?*

Lin Cheng grinned at Xiaochun. “Gladly! Anything for Siqi.”

Xiaochun pouted. “You only have eyes for her, though she cares naught. Why chase iron while tender meat awaits?” She rolled her eyes.

Xiaolian added, “Senior Brother Linchen, it’s been ages! I’ve missed your visits to Convergence Peak.”

“Ah, with the Six Peaks Tournament nearing, Master’s kept me training. But no matter how I grind, I’ll never surpass Siqi!” His jowly face quivered with laughter. “Since you’re heading back, I’ll escort you.”

“Splendid!” Xiaolian clapped.

Throughout this, Guanyu was treated as air. Evidently, both junior sisters fancied this runt—puzzling, given the many comelier disciples nearby.

“Unnecessary, Senior Brother Lin,” Siqi cut in coldly. “We’re bound for the Ancestral Shrine. Without the Sect Leader’s leave, you cannot follow. Farewell.”

Guanyu smirked. “How tiresome—buzzing flies at every turn.” Turning to Siqi, he urged, “Let’s hasten, lest Grandmaster Jiu bar the shrine gates. Wouldn’t want you keeping me company outdoors all night.”

The jab struck home. Lin Cheng flushed crimson, glaring up at Guanyu. “Who the hell are you? Know your place, worm! Siqi accompanying YOU? I’ll skin you alive!”

“You’d have me roll? Very well—but regret awaits.” Guanyu strode off, ignoring the threat.

Lin Cheng shook with rage. “Mark my words, brat! You’ll pay dearly for this insolence!”

**Chapter 3159: Settling Scores**

The women panicked—they’d sworn to escort Guanyu safely. Xiaolian cried, “Guanyu, wait! Must you rush?”

Lin Cheng sneered. “Let the coward flee! Who is he to command Siqi’s company?”

“Senior Brother,” Xiaolian warned, “Guanyu is the Sect Leader’s newly adopted disciple—so favored that our own master was confined for a year! Cross him at your peril.”

Lin Cheng swelled with false bravado. “A greenhorn? I’ll break him like twig!”

Xiaochun added, “He addresses Sect Leader and Elder Lu as ‘Grandfather.’ Their bond is... unique.”

Lin Cheng’s eyes narrowed. “So he’s the one who maimed Ling Su? I vowed vengeance!”

“Aye,” Xiaolian confirmed. “He confessed before Elder Dai herself. Yet Sect Leader punished Ling Su instead.”

As they spoke, Siqi had already followed Guanyu into the distance. Lin Cheng’s fury crested—no man shared Siqi’s proximity unchallenged.

Guanyu walked silently, Siqi studying his profile. To her, he seemed neither aggressor nor pushover—one who tolerated no disrespect. Puzzled by his earlier retreat, she asked, “Why yield? Fear of implicating me?”

Guanyu arched a brow. “You read me well. That pustule disgusts me. Best avoided.” His true motive: luring Lin Cheng into overreach. By leaving, he forced Siqi to follow, provoking confrontation.

True to plan, Lin Cheng came charging. “Siqi! Let me escort you! Night travels with strangers are perilous.”

Guanyu sighed. “Must this vermin dog our steps?”

“You little bastard!” Lin Cheng brandished his sword. “I’ll claim Ling Su’s debt now! Sever a hand, or die here!”

Siqi stepped between them. “Harm him, and you answer to me.”

Guanyu gently pulled her wrist. “Waste not breath on filth.”

Lin Cheng exploded. “You dare touch her?! Die!”

**Chapter 3160: Indelible Impressions**

Guanyu turned, eyes glinting. “Test me, and you’ll regret it. I left not from fear, but contempt. Strike a sect brother, and face execution.”

“Arrogant maggot!” Lin Cheng chanted spellwork, sword ablaze. For all his prowess, casting before Guanyu was folly—a novice’s blunder.

Yet Guanyu held back—better to feign victimhood. Let Lin Cheng attack first; self-defense would justify retaliation.

Xiaochun and Xiaolian watched, unwilling to mediate between Sect Leader’s favorite and Elder Dai’s prodigy.

Siqi drew her blade. “Touch him, and cross blades with me.”

Maddened, Lin Cheng roared, “I’ll butcher this upstart! Master’s scolding be damned!”

Guanyu whispered to Siqi, “Stand down. Let him hang himself.”

As Lin Cheng lunged, Guanyu sidestepped, allowing the blade to graze his arm—blood welled.

“Witnessed by all!” Guanyu shouted. “Senior Brother Lin assaults a junior under Sect Leader’s protection!”

Lin Cheng paled. The trap snapped shut.
