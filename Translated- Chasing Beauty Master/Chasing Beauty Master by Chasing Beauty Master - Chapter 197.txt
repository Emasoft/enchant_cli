Guan Yu nodded lightly, picked up the phone the thug had thrown aside, dialed 911, and activated his scanning system to check if any bite victims had life-threatening injuries needing stabilization. The situation appeared far better than anticipated – perhaps due to his timely intervention.

"Why did the venomous insects only attack them?" Liu Shilei glanced at the seven corpses, unable to suppress her confusion.

Guan Yu smiled faintly. "The heavens claim the despicable."

Liu Shilei snorted laughter, rolling her eyes. "You’re full of nonsense."

Involuntarily, her hand tightened around Guan Yu’s. The joy of surviving a life-threatening ordeal clarified his significance in her heart – this man had quietly claimed her entire being. Witnessing his bare-handed combat against armed assailants for her sake had terrified yet elated her. She vowed to cherish this hard-won happiness.

Noticing the sudden tenderness in Liu Shilei’s gaze, Guan Yu responded with a knowing smile.

Police soon breached the premises. As the only uninjured witnesses, Guan Yu’s trio were escorted for statements.

After formalities concluded, Guan Yu accompanied Liu Shilei and Mo Ling to faculty housing. Mo Ling remained visibly shaken.

Puzzled, Guan Yu wondered how this usually fearless girl could crumble under pressure.

Turning to Liu Shilei, he suggested, "Sister, rest after today’s ordeal. I’ll take my leave."

Liu Shilei nodded gently. "Travel safely."

With a wave, Guan Yu began departing when Mo Ling’s voice halted him – her first words since the jewelry store.

As he turned, delicate fragrance enveloped him. Mo Ling’s soft embrace caught him off-guard.

Her porcelain cheek brushed his ear as she whispered, "Thank you."

Releasing him, she offered a faint smile before linking arms with Liu Shilei. "I can’t sleep alone tonight, Sister Shilei. Stay with me."

Laughing, they entered the building. Liu Shilei shot Guan Yu an amused glance over her shoulder, leaving him bewildered by Mo Ling’s sudden affection before he shrugged and departed.

Returning to the villa, Guan Yu slipped into Du Xiaojuan’s room. Finding her laptop-browsing on bed, he embraced her from behind. "Still awake?"

Du Xiaojuan turned with pouting reproach. "Never seeing you anymore! Wenqing-jie says you’ve many women outside – replacing old loves with new."

Guan Yu’s brow furrowed. Besides Liu Shilei, only Li Xi counted – Wenqing’s meddling complicated things.

With placating charm, he produced a ring. "Who said I was carousing? Shopping for your gift!"

Du Xiaojuan’s eyes sparkled, dimples appearing as she kissed his cheek. "I knew hubby’s the best!"

Thrilled by his first gift, she beamed as he slid the ring onto her finger.

"By the way," she added, "Gao Wei-jie arrives tomorrow. Let’s meet her flight?"

"Gao Wei?" Guan Yu paused. "Why’s she coming?"

"Being a celebrity, she’s here for events and commercials," Du Xiaojuan explained.

"Flight time?"

"8 AM."

"Early indeed. Let’s retire." Guan Yu smirked suggestively.

Chapter 488: Do Me a Favor

At Taiping International Airport, a discreet figure emerged – face half-hidden behind oversized sunglasses. Spotting familiar waves, her lips curved beneath the mask.

"Gao Wei-jie! Welcome back!" Du Xiaojuan identified her instantly despite the disguise.

Embracing, Gao Wei smiled. "Missed you too."

While they reunited, Guan Yu appraised Gao Wei’s enhanced figure – more statuesque than remembered, with willowy waist, ample curves, and striking beauty.

Sensing his gaze, Gao Wei turned. "Long overdue thanks."

Guan Yu gestured dismissal. "Let’s breakfast elsewhere. Public recognition risks hassle."

"Hubby’s been complaining of hunger," Du Xiaojuan added.

"Hubby?" Gao Wei arched a brow, recalling Guan Yu with another woman. Suspicion kindled quiet ire.

Blushing, Du Xiaojuan explained, "Adopted Wenqing-jie’s habit."

"Wenqing-jie?" Gao Wei’s confusion deepened.

Guan Yu deflected, "Move along before fans swarm."

Noticing Gao Wei’s cooled demeanor, he sighed inwardly – female moods shifted faster than spring weather.

At a quiet breakfast nook, Gao Wei removed sunglasses. Between fried dough sticks and soybean milk, she addressed Guan Yu: "Though philandering, thank you for the police station incident. Let me toast with豆浆."

Guan Yu choked on his cruller. "Thanks needn’t include insults."

Clinking cups, he asked, "Why vanish post-detention?"

Gao Wei sighed. "Company pressured by Park Xu’s family over that recording. Nearly got shelved for two years."

"Resolved how?" Du Xiaojuan inquired.

Gao Wei smiled cryptically. "Second reason to thank Guan Yu. Your charity gala humiliation left Sanxie Group crumbling. My company reinstated me for profit."

Comprehension dawned. Guan Yu’s vendetta had unintentionally aided her.

Du Xiaojuan marveled, "Hubby’s that influential?"

"Toppling military scions and conglomerates?" Gao Wei grinned. "Quite."

Guan Yu shrugged. "Park Xu deserved it for art fraud."

Leaning closer, Gao Wei observed, "Despite lechery, you achieve the impossible. Hence..."

"Help me." Her crescent-moon eyes sparkled.

Chapter 489: Car Crash

Guan Yu groaned – praise always preceded traps. "What could a star need?"

"Be my shield against pursuer Bai Jie – mega-celebrity turned nuisance."

"Perfect celebrity couple?" Guan Yu teased.

"Worse womanizer than you."

Regretting his query, Guan Yu deduced: "Fake boyfriend act?"

Blushing, Gao Wei nodded. "Xiaojuan approves."

Du Xiaojuan chimed, "Help her, hubby!"

"What’s my incentive?" Guan Yu demanded.

"Being my beau isn’t enough?" Gao Wei retorted.

"Fake title merits real reward." Guan Yu grinned roguishly. "A kiss."

"You... with Xiaojuan present!" Gao Wei fumed.

Du Xiaojuan mediated, "He jests. He’ll help."

"If he insists..."

"Then kiss! More sisters join me!" Du Xiaojuan’s innocent suggestion made both adults spit豆浆.

Changing subject, Gao Wei stood. "Finished. What’s next?"
