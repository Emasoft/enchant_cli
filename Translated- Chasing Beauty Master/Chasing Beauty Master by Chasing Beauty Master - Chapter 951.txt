“If we let you police intervene, this matter would surely cause a public uproar. That’s why we can’t handle it too openly. Our boss is investigating discreetly. Once we uncover the truth, we’ll ensure justice for the victim and reassure the sisters in the cafeteria. Then the matter can be quietly resolved. Does Director Song have a better solution?”

Jiang Fenju’s words flew like spittle, his true aim to buy time. Director Song wavered, unsure whether to believe him, torn between two dilemmas.

On one side was Sister Ji, whose long-term patronage and generous benefits Director Song relied upon. On the other was Guan Yu—a man Director Song knew all too well was not to be trifled with.

Skeptical of Jiang Fenju’s claims, Director Song stepped back to call Sister Ji. “Sister Ji, the situation at the school gate is too complicated. Guan Yu’s men refuse to budge, and I can’t force them. You know how it is—a small-time director like me can’t afford to cross Guan Yu.”

Sister Ji hung up without a word. Humiliated, Director Song muttered, “Ungrateful bitch,” then ordered his men, “Withdraw…”

Ge Yinglai watched in confusion as the police left, leaving the stage to Guan Yu.

Though Ge’s side had over a hundred men, within twenty minutes, both ends of the street were flooded with Guan Yu’s forces—a sheer numbers game. Without warning, Guan Yu’s men surged forward, smashing both people and vehicles. As Ge prepared to join the fray, a masked figure intercepted him, their clash instantaneous.

Ge’s hundred-strong group, once confident, now seemed pitifully outnumbered. Opponents swarmed like ants—three or four against one—scattering Ge’s men in moments. Within a minute, his forces fled or fell injured, their vehicles reduced to scrap.

As Ge struggled to break free, the masked fighter—matched in skill—held him trapped.

By midnight, chaos engulfed A City’s streets, cries and clashes echoing from Kaihuang Academy’s gates across half the metropolis.

**Chapter 2,432: No Entry**

Whether due to Guan Yu’s relentless subordinates or Ge’s fleeing men, by 1 a.m., two frantic figures sprinted westward, pursued by a dozen assailants—all the way to Jones’ headquarters in the west.

The pursuers didn’t aim to kill. Once a target was subdued with minor injuries, they moved on. Guan Yu’s goal: crush Ge’s arrogance, proving A City remained under his dominion.

The masked man harrying Ge was Hou Jinshun, manager of Huaye Club. Disguised to avoid implicating his employer, Hou engaged Ge in guerilla tactics—dodging attacks but blocking retreats until Ge seethed helplessly.

After an hour, the street teemed with Guan Yu’s forces: left side manned by Wei Hongwei and Jia Bo leading Yu Faction members and Hou’s allies; right side occupied by the Free Organization’s cultivators, their strength formidable even as others chased Ge’s remnants.

Now isolated, Ge trembled amidst 500 encircling enemies—his first taste of true fear. “You think you dare touch me?” he roared. “Do you know who backs me? My patron would terrify you worms!”

Guan Yu awaited this moment—to unveil Ge’s hidden benefactor. As Hou prepared to strike again, engine roars interrupted. From the school emerged Sister Ji.

Vehicles couldn’t penetrate the crowd. Jiang Fenju barred Sister Ji’s path. “My boss’s orders: no entry or exit tonight. Retreat, madam, lest violence erupt.”

From the periphery emerged a bald, middle-aged man—thick gold chain, dragon tattoo on his left shoulder—bellowing, “Lower your filthy arm! Little shits daring to cause trouble at this hour?”

Sister Ji’s reinforcements had arrived—unexpected to Guan Yu. Mistaking his target, she’d summoned outsiders, delayed as they hailed from beyond A City.

Hou lunged at the bald man, who dodged surprisingly swiftly. Assessing him, Hou realized he couldn’t gauge the man’s cultivation level. “Leave now,” Hou warned, “or face consequences.”

“You think I’ll obey?” the bald man sneered, only halted by Sister Ji’s shout. She sought to avoid irrevocable conflict with Guan Yu.

Jiang Fenju remained unmoved. “Director Song was informed: a rape occurred on campus. As Kaihuang’s largest faction, Yu Gang must enforce justice. Tonight’s lockdown is for investigation. Yet you escalate? Our boss gives you ten minutes to withdraw.”

“You threaten us?” Sister Ji retorted. “Numbers don’t guarantee victory.”

“Enough talk!” the bald man yelled. “Attack!”

“Halt!” Hou’s qi-infused roar froze the crowd. The bald man smirked. “Beg on your knees, and I might spare you.”

As tensions peaked, more engines growled—Patriarch Yang arrived with elite Free Organization members, including Second-Class Supreme cultivators. Sister Ji paled, recognizing the杨家 (Yang Family) leader’s presence sealed her defeat.

“Tonight’s operation is my son-in-law Guan Yu’s decree,” Patriarch Yang declared. “Forced entry costs a leg.”

The bald man, finally grasping the imbalance, cursed Sister Ji inwardly for leading him into disaster. Even his bravado faltered upon seeing Yang’s might.

Sister Ji, desperate, pleaded, “A misunderstanding, Patriarch Yang! My friend here is an outsider, unaware—”

“Too late for excuses,” Yang interrupted. “Your cafeteria drug trade—did you think it hidden? Guan Yu acts for the school’s sake. Exposed, you’d face ruin.”

Ge Yinglai’s scheme—luring Sister Ji into narcotics profits—now unraveled. Though initially resistant, she’d succumbed to greed, her coffers swelling from the trade.

“Lies!” Sister Ji blustered. “Don’t be fooled by slander!”

Patriarch Yang turned to Ge. “She shifts blame to you. Your response?”

**Chapter 2,433: The Power Play**

Ge Yinglai, cornered, spat, “This is bullshit! I’ve got nothing to do with her deals!”

Patriarch Yang’s gaze hardened. “Denials won’t save you. The evidence is clear. Guan Yu’s cleansing this filth from Kaihuang.”

Sister Ji, trembling, realized resistance was futile. Guan Yu’s web—spanning underworld and elite—had ensnared her completely. The bald man’s men, outnumbered threefold, dropped their weapons, fear overriding loyalty.

“Withdraw,” Yang commanded. “Or join them in ruin.”

As Sister Ji’s allies dispersed, Guan Yu emerged, his presence silencing the street. “A City,” he said, “belongs to order. Poison it, and I’ll purge you root and stem.”

The message rang clear: no force, hidden or brazen, could challenge Guan Yu’s reign.
