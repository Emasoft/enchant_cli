Yet he still proceeded, for disregarding the Emperor's summons would constitute defiance of imperial decree - a capital offense. However, the Emperor's edict contained only the summons itself without any explanation, fueling rampant speculation.

Many believed the Emperor's failing health and dissatisfaction with both princes' inadequacies had delayed the designation of an heir. This sudden summons for Prince Zou from distant Liaozhou clearly indicated extraordinary circumstances.

Naturally, the princes' factions wouldn't permit Prince Zou's smooth entry into the capital. Assassination attempts were inevitable. Even if the Emperor hadn't intended to name Prince Zou as successor, eliminating this potential threat became imperative for the princes' security.

The elder prince, though diligent in studies, suffered from dull intellect. Despite strenuous efforts, his slow comprehension frustrated all tutors. The younger prince possessed sharp wit but squandered it in debauchery. His notoriety began at age ten when he assaulted a palace maid - an incident shielded from punishment by his mother's influence.

Instead of reforming, the younger prince escalated his depravity. During lunar new year festivities, he spied on and drugged a bathing concubine before violating her. Though the Emperor punished him severely, his royal status and youth ultimately spared him lasting consequences.

Subsequent transgressions occurred with calculated stealth under his mother's protection. Disgusted by both heirs, the ailing Emperor summoned Prince Zou - a lifesaver from his youth - as death approached.

Unaware his summons would endanger Prince Zou, the Emperor's belated proclamation of "merely meeting an old friend" proved futile. Prince Zou's caravan already traveled the perilous road, suspicion having taken root.

Ah Gang reported: "Your Highness, the elderly farmers ahead welcome us. I've distributed silver coins. Night approaches - we should hasten."

**Chapter 3960: Breaking Out Together**

The procession advanced into thickening bamboo forest mists until darkness rendered visibility nil. Ah Gang's vanguard struggled to navigate, barely half a mile from the farmhouse where shelter awaited.

"Chain hands! Mounted men grip the weapon of ahead rider!" Prince Zou Wuya's command echoed through fog.

Whistling arrows erupted instantly. Unprepared guards fell wounded as panicked horses reared. A second volley struck with greater force, attackers concealed by impenetrable mist.

"Shield formation! Protect His Highness!" Ah Gang roared.

Battered yet persistent, the group finally reached the farmhouse. Knowing assassins lurked outside, Prince Zou sighed at his wounded men: "You six - inside. We must confer."

His three adopted children and three captains gathered beneath the farm's awning. Before humble fare, the prince lamented: "Pity there's no wine for this damp night. Let tea serve as farewell drink. After this cup, disperse - remaining together means certain death."

Zou Wuhui, the lone woman among them, protested first: "We've been Your Highness' people since childhood! Death cannot part us!"

"Nor us!" Ah Gang vowed. "Your noble spirit guides us. We'll see you safely to the capital!"

Touched yet pragmatic, the prince reasoned: "We're visible targets in this trap. Staying ensures mutual destruction."

"Then destruction we'll share!" Zou Wuhui declared.

"Wine, milords?" A straw-hatted farmer hobbled over with a jar, his wrinkled hands belying smooth wrists. "Partings need proper libations."

As the farmer retreated after exchanging pleasantries, Zou Wuhui's blade flashed. Her kick dropped the "old man" whose fallen hat revealed youthful features. "Spy! Your hands betray you!"

**Chapter 3961: Special Identity**

The exposed youth - Guan Yu - grinned ruefully: "Had I wished harm, I'd have joined the ambush. I offer escape."

Prince Zou waved restraint. "Explain your masquerade."

"Solitude seeker," Guan Yu shrugged. "Elderly guise prevents trouble... until your arrival."

Zou Wuhui pressed her blade: "Your solution, impostor?"

"Coordinate before dawn," Guan Yu advised. "The fog hinders them too. Their numbers grow hourly."

Skepticism filled the room until Guan Yu added: "They've one true expert among many foot soldiers. Breakthrough isn't impossible."

**Chapter 3962: No Great Difficulty**

Guan Yu continued: "Your enemies assume fog favors them. Reverse this - use blindness equally. I'll guide two groups: decoys northeast, main force southwest during third watch."

Prince Zou's eyes narrowed. "You know military tactics. Who truly are you?"

"Merely Guan Yu, wandering problem-solver. The real question - do you prefer survival or suspicion?"

As debate raged, distant shouts confirmed encircling reinforcements. Guan Yu produced a bamboo map. "Secret paths exist. Your choice - trust or perish."

Zou Wuhui sheathed her sword reluctantly. The prince nodded. "We proceed at third watch. Let history judge this gamble."
