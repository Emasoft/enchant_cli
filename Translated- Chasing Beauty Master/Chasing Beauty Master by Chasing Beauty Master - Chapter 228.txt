He entered the ward, first nodding to Guan Yu as a greeting, then turned his gaze to Liu Gang lying on the hospital bed. "Director Liu, what did the doctor say?"

"Principal, you mustn't shield this student any longer. He's gone too far this time," Liu Gang complained bitterly upon seeing the principal's arrival.

The principal's brows furrowed slightly with displeasure. He'd come here out of genuine concern for Liu's condition, yet this fool immediately accused him of partiality toward Guan Yu in front of others? This implied he'd abused his authority for personal favors.

His tone turned frostily official. "I never show favoritism to anyone. Every matter must follow reason. Whichever side is at fault will face strict punishment."

Liu Gang's heart leaped with secret triumph—this was exactly the response he'd wanted. To ensure Guan Yu received the harshest penalty, he'd even revealed his humiliating fear of becoming a "quick shot" (premature ejaculator) in future relationships.

Such a grave accusation would force the principal's hand. If Guan Yu remained enrolled now, it would be a slap to the administration's face.

After hearing Liu's account, the principal's frown deepened. He turned to Guan Yu. "Is everything Director Liu said true?"

Guan Yu smiled lazily, adjusting his posture comfortably. "Principal, I did kick him—but not for the reasons he claims. His story about me cheating and attacking him in shameful anger is pure fabrication."

Throughout Liu's theatrical lament, Guan Yu had remained silent, coldly observing this solo performance with inner scorn. Had he not been the accused, even he might have believed Liu's vivid lies crafted to expel him.

"Are you saying Director Liu is lying?" The principal's trust naturally inclined toward Guan Yu.

"I'm not lying!" Liu's bluster weakened slightly. "Though I didn't witness the cheating directly, I'm certain he cheated. I stood by him for thirty minutes—he kept looking around, completely distracted. Yet he finished the entire exam in ten minutes afterward! Principal, doesn't this prove dishonesty?"

Guan Yu snorted. "Who decreed exams must take ninety minutes? Is completing work efficiently now a crime?"

"I..." Liu struggled to counter. The world held many prodigies, but knowing Guan Yu had never attended math classes, Liu refused to believe this capability. "You didn't even glance at the paper during those thirty minutes! How could you possibly finish?"

Guan Yu leaned forward mockingly. "Don't you find your reasoning flimsy? Shall I interpret this as malicious slander?"

Chapter 568: Conflict

"Just as the willows conceal the flowers, another village emerges"—this proverb perfectly captured Liu Gang's renewed hope.

"Officers, I'm the one who filed the report," Liu reiterated to the police.

"Then please describe the incident," said Zheng Tian, Liu's brother-in-law, approaching the hospital bed.

Liu nodded, pointing at Guan Yu. "As an educator fulfilling my duties during exam supervision, this person assaulted me."

Wisely avoiding mention of cheating allegations that could constitute false testimony, Liu simply stated his role as invigilator. Let the officers infer the rest—a tactic learned from Guan Yu's earlier lesson.

Zheng Tian frowned, turning to Guan Yu. "You're accused of intentional assault. Come with us."

Guan Yu laughed derisively. "You'd detain me based on his word alone? How dutiful of a brother-in-law."

Zheng Tian's face darkened, shooting Liu an irritated glance. This public exposure of their familial relationship implied corruption before his colleagues—an indelible stain on his professionalism.

Both men paled. Having only recently joined N University, Liu had kept this relation secret. How had Guan Yu discovered it? This revelation likely solidified the principal's suspicion of framing, plunging Liu into fresh humiliation.

Suddenly, Liu seized upon a crucial detail. "Call it my word? Surveillance footage captured your entire assault! Let's review the recording!"

"All that lard hasn't clogged your brain after all," Guan Yu sneered. "True, I struck him—in self-defense."

"Self-defense?" Liu nearly cursed aloud. What defense? This was outright aggression!

"Are the cameras operational?" Zheng Tian interjected, regaining composure. Evidence would legitimize his actions despite familial ties.

Liu nodded smugly. "Anti-cheating protocols required active surveillance." His triumphant gaze challenged Guan Yu.

"Retrieve the footage," Zheng Tian ordered sternly before addressing Guan Yu. "Any objections now? You're coming with us."

Guan Yu stood firm. "I maintain it was self-defense. With video proof, why should I go?"

"Determination comes after evidence review. Comply now," Zheng Tian demanded, patience thinning.

"Ha! I trust police—just not you."

"Enough! Officer Wang, detain him." Zheng Tian's civility evaporated. Were Liu not family, he'd have ignored this petty campus squabble.

The rookie Officer Wang approached with handcuffs. Guan Yu sidestepped smoothly.

"Resisting arrest?" Wang sneered, attempting a police academy hold. His sluggish movements looked comical to Guan Yu, who effortlessly reversed the grip on Wang's wrist.

"Release me!" Wang roared, kicking at Guan Yu's ribs. Their legs collided—

*Thud!*

Wang staggered back five steps, back hitting the wall as he crumpled, clutching his shin. "Damn! His leg's made of steel?!"

"You dare assault an officer?!" Zheng Tian thundered, though inwardly wary of Guan Yu's combat skills surpassing his own.

"Self-defense... again. How conveniently my protectors become aggressors," Guan Yu mocked, predator-like poise unnerving the room.

Chapter 569: The End of the Line

All present understood Guan Yu's sarcasm—and its truth.

Every action had been reactive. Guan Yu's defense appeared legally airtight.

"You provoked the arrest!" Zheng Tian countered swiftly.

"Evidence?"

"The cameras recorded everything!"

"Then review it first. I'm busy with exams." Guan Yu's nonchalance infuriated Zheng Tian—since when did suspects dictate police schedules?

"Moreover," Guan Yu added, "I've determined your incompetence. Send someone credible."

Zheng Tian's eye twitched. "This isn't a hotel! Move!"

"Since you refuse, I'll summon proper authorities myself." Guan Yu emphasized "proper" mockingly.

"Try! Who'd dare interfere?" Zheng Tian retorted, secretly signaling reinforcements.

"The police department belongs to you?" boomed an authoritative voice from the doorway.

"Obviously," Zheng Tian snapped automatically before freezing—the voice wasn't Guan Yu's.

Director Nie stood imposingly in the threshold. "Officer Zheng, such grand ambitions."

"Dir-Director Nie!" Zheng Tian stammered, realization dawning. Guan Yu's "brother" was the police commissioner!

"Your brother-in-law?" Nie's glance at Liu confirmed the relationship.

"Y-yes, but I've been impartial!" Zheng Tian sweated.

Nie nodded coldly. "Public service demands integrity. Handle this appropriately."

As Zheng Tian groveled assurances, Nie turned to Guan Yu. "Troubled, brother?"

"Minor inconveniences," Guan Yu shrugged.

"Traffic management needs dedicated officers," Nie mused. "You'd suit that role, Zheng Tian."

Zheng Tian's career as captain ended with that sentence.
