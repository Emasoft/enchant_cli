“I’m fine. Where is this place?” Guan Yu glanced around curiously. His last memory was of being in the forest, feeling as if his body were about to explode from unbearable agony. Everything after that remained a blank.

“You lost consciousness, and strange events unfolded. Don’t fret—I’ll explain everything slowly.” Xiao Zhi smiled warmly. He felt immense relief at Guan Yu’s awakening and couldn’t stop thanking the Medicine Immortal. “Truly worthy of the title Medicine Immortal! Guan Yu, your revival owes entirely to his aid. Without him, I’d have been at a loss.”

Supported by Xiao Zhi, Guan Yu bowed slightly to the Medicine Immortal. “My deepest gratitude for your intervention, esteemed Medicine Immortal. I never imagined the legendary healer would be such a youthful and striking figure. You’ve broadened my horizons.”

“You flatter me.” The Medicine Immortal waved a hand. “Your body harbors two distinct spiritual energies and two internal forces—a perilous combination. Cultivators must avoid greed, lest they end like you: with incompatible energies creating barriers between them. These forces vie for dominance within you. Most would suffer severed meridians or outright bodily explosion.

“Had you not encountered me, these warring energies would have trapped you in eternal slumber. Yet one mystery remains.” He leaned forward intently. “I detected an immense, unfamiliar power in your mind—like a black hole. What is it?”

Guan Yu nodded, impressed by the healer’s insight. “You’re correct. My energies are chaotic beyond comprehension. These forces were imposed upon me—I never sought this turmoil.”

“For now, you’re stable. But avoid channeling spiritual energy recklessly, lest it provoke rebellion from the other forces.” The Medicine Immortal studied Guan Yu thoughtfully. “As a Cloud Azure Sect disciple, your sect’s energy is surprisingly faint within you. How peculiar your cultivation path must appear. Yet being both demonic and martial, I’d wager your sect treasures you dearly.”

“Indeed!” Xiao Zhi interjected excitedly. “Not only our Sect Master, but all Cloud Azure elders hold Guan Yu in highest regard! Your discernment amazes, Medicine Immortal—to instantly recognize his dual cultivation!”

**Chapter 3742: Three-Headed Wolf**

The Medicine Immortal smiled faintly. “You’ve recently consumed a mind-stabilizing elixir that enhances cultivation. Cease its use immediately. While beneficial under normal circumstances, it now destabilizes your conflicting energies.”

Xiao Zhi realized—this referred to Senior Brother Yan Zhao’s “gift.” “Guan Yu, discard those sect pills. Henceforth, heed only the Medicine Immortal’s counsel.”

“Speaking of—where is Yan Zhao?” Guan Yu glanced around. The man’s absence unsettled him. Unaware of Yan Zhao’s murderous intent, he still believed the senior brother meant well—nearly a fatal misconception.

Xiao Zhi frowned. “After securing lodgings at a farmstead, I sought the Medicine Immortal for your treatment. Upon returning... the elderly farmers lay murdered. Yan Zhao vanished, while some beast dragged you to a cave. Had Brother Xiao Qi not found you...” He shuddered.

“Murdered farmers? By imperial troops?” Guan Yu’s eyes widened.

“Soldiers aren’t saints, but they don’t slaughter innocents.” The Medicine Immortal shook his head. “A monster committed the deed.”

“Monster? I recall nothing!”

Xiao Qi, a youthful voice, piped up: “I saw it! Enormous head, towering frame, black fur matted with blood—”

“Hush!” The Medicine Immortal silenced him. “Speculation helps nothing.”

“Black fur...” Guan Yu’s thoughts raced to Black Blood Ridge’s infamous blood poison. Victims erupted in dark pelts during transformation. Could demonic cultivators be targeting him? Yet the Demonic Soul Sect had recalled Wang Xiaorong. The puzzle deepened.

Xiao Zhi turned to the Medicine Immortal. “Are you wolf demons?”

“Call me Three-Heads.” The admission came calmly. Earlier clues—communication with white eagles, preternatural healing skills—had revealed their nature to Xiao Zhi.

“We’re wolf demons, but not evil!” Xiao Qi blurted. “Big Brother Three-Heads heals villagers here, asking only chickens as payment. We harm none!”

Three-Heads sighed at the boy’s candor. Guan Yu raised a hand. “Peace. We judge by deeds, not species.”

Xiao Qi chattered on: “We’ve been here ages, but that True Sun Sect priest started competing! Stole our patients! When Elder confronted him...” His stomach growled loudly. “Any food?”

Three-Heads departed to prepare rice. As Xiao Zhi conversed with Xiao Qi, tragic history emerged—the young wolf’s family slaughtered for fur, rescued by Three-Heads.

**Chapter 3743: Schemes Unveiled**

“If your Five-Headed Elder was so powerful,” Xiao Zhi mused, “how was he captured?”

Xiao Qi’s expression darkened. “Half-year past, that True Sun elder arrived. Sabotaged our work—starved us. When Elder went to reason... poisoned wine! Imprisoned since!”

Guan Yu listened silently. His distrust of “righteous” sects deepened—their hypocrisy often surpassed demonic cruelty. Meanwhile, suspicion turned toward Yan Zhao: Could he be the blood-poisoned monster?

Xiao Zhi defended True Sun’s reputation, recalling his merciful duel with their elder. Yet contradictions lingered. As rice arrived, Xiao Qi devoured it hungrily, muffled “delicious!” sounds escaping.

Elsewhere, Yan Zhao writhed in agony—clawing at his head, crashing against trees. A figure materialized: Left Envoy of Demonic Soul Sect.

“Blood poison erupting off-cycle?” Cold amusement laced his voice. A glowing bracelet subdued Yan Zhao’s transformation.

Gasping on the ground, Yan Zhao rasped thanks. Left Envoy sneered: “My antidote should’ve lasted through moon cycle. What foolishness caused this?”

“Merely... cultivation mishap,” Yan Zhao lied, hiding his attempt on Guan Yu.

“Fortune smiles—my timely arrival saved you.” Left Envoy’s eyes narrowed. “But ask no questions. Tend to your survival.”

**Chapter 3744: Fate’s Mercy**

Yan Zhao’s mind reeled. Fragmented memories—the farmhouse, approaching Guan Yu, then blacking out. Why had Left Envoy appeared here?

The envoy vanished, leaving Yan Zhao to ponder his deteriorating control. Blood poison’s hold strengthened daily—soon, no cure might suffice. Yet ambition burned: steal Eight-Sided Drum cultivation, claim power... if the poison didn’t claim him first.
