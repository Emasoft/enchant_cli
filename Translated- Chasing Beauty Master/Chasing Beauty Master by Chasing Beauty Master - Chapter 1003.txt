“Boss, I didn’t mean to disturb you so early,” Wei Hongwei said apologetically. “But today, some guests came to my house—old friends of my dad. They’ve long heard of your reputation and wanted to meet you. After arriving in City A, they were even more impressed by your fame and insisted on getting acquainted.”

Few knew Guan Yu’s true identity—only top-tier elites. To most, he was merely the son-in-law of the Yang family or the leader of the Yu Gang, two roles that already granted him unchallenged authority in City A. Yet Guan Yu preferred a low profile, avoiding unnecessary conflicts. Outside elite circles, few ever crossed paths with him.

Guan Yu frowned. What kind of people, connected to Wei Hongwei’s father, would seek him out? He could easily refuse, but out of respect for Wei Hongwei, he decided to humor the request. In these chaotic times, making allies outweighed creating enemies. “What sort of people does your father associate with?” he asked. “Why are they so eager to meet me?”

Suspicion lingered—perhaps they sought fragments of the treasure map rumored to be in his possession.

Wei Hongwei shrugged. “Not sure. This morning, a few monks showed up. After they left, Dad asked me to arrange this meeting. Oh, and he doubled my allowance if I pull this off. Boss, you’ve gotta help me secure that cash!”

Guan Yu nearly scoffed. Using connections to milk pocket money? Ridiculous. But before he could refuse, Wei Hongwei added, “Those monks seemed… unusual. Skilled, maybe. Could be useful allies down the line.”

After a moment’s thought, Guan Yu nodded. “Fine. Set a time and place.”

Wei Hongwei laughed gleefully. “Thanks, Boss! Once I get that allowance, dinner’s on me!”

“Save the dinner. Just stay out of trouble,” Guan Yu warned before hanging up.

In the living room, he flipped through TV channels absently. The sound of clattering pans drew him to the kitchen, where Amei bustled over breakfast. “Up so early, Guan Yu?” she teased, cheeks flushing as he hugged her. “Off somewhere? Should I wake Sister Jing?”

“No rush. Let her sleep—she’s exhausted lately.”

Amei swatted him playfully. “Go check on Hanhan. Her door’s ajar again.”

Upstairs, Guan Yu peeked into Zhang Han’s room. Chaos reigned: snack wrappers, fruit peels, three girls tangled across the bed. Zhang Han’s foot nearly grazed Lü Mei’s mouth, while Lanyu—when had she arrived?—lay pinned under Han’s head. They slept like the dead, likely up gaming till dawn.

Back downstairs, Guan Yu cornered Amei. “How late have they been playing?”

Amei hesitated. “I… I go to bed early. Not sure.”

He sighed. “Never mind. I’ll handle it.”

Outside, morning light silhouetted Sakurako practicing Tai Chi. Guan Yu smirked. “Still on your ‘Women’s Fist’ kick?”

She shot him a mock glare. “It’s Tai Chi. And I’m improving!”

Their banter shifted to martial philosophy. “Any style’s effectiveness depends on the practitioner,” Guan Yu mused. “Talent and fit matter more than the form itself.”

Sakurako nodded thoughtfully. “I want to master something—anything—to stand beside my brother.”

“You will,” Guan Yu assured. “Tai Chi’s a good path.”

At breakfast, Xue Jing groaned over her bowl. “Amei, your cooking’s too good! I’ll balloon like a whale!”

“Nonsense,” Amei laughed. “You’re perfect as is.”

Guan Yu eyed the empty seats. “Let the gaming zombies sleep. But starting today—” his voice hardened, “—anyone caught playing past midnight loses meals and snacks. Snitches get rewarded.”

Xue Jing snorted. “Good luck enforcing that.”

As Sakurako resumed her drills, Guan Yu surveyed his unconventional household—a mix of chaos and quiet determination. For now, peace held. But in City A, tranquility never lasted long.
