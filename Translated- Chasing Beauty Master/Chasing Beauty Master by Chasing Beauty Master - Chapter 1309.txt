“These large pits must have existed long ago, even before the poplar grove took root. As the forest gradually developed, the dense foliage and abundant leaves accumulated over the years, layer upon layer, until they concealed these pits beneath—transforming them into natural traps.”

After hearing Wang Xiaorong’s explanation, Guan Yu nodded. This theory made perfect sense.

“So what do we do now?” Second to Wolf interjected. “After your little lecture, I’m almost too scared to walk. Who knows if there are more pits ahead? If I slip and fall, I might not be lucky enough to grab you again.”

Wang Xiaorong ignored his sarcasm, knowing he was merely joking—and considering he had just saved her.

With a smile, she suggested, “The poplars here are sparser, and there are small clearings where moonlight shines through. We can simply use flight techniques to cross this area.”

“Brilliant idea!” Xiao Zhi clapped enthusiastically. “If we travel aboveground, even a field of pits won’t trouble us!”

Though practical, this plan vexed Second to Wolf. Cultivators like them could soar freely with flight or sword techniques, but as a martial artist, his qinggong leaps required footholds for propulsion—a far cry from effortless flight. Yet pride kept him silent, especially after mocking the cultivators’ physical weakness earlier.

Noticing his discomfort, Guan Yu offered, “Since Second to Wolf and I can’t fly, Xiao Zhi and A Ze can carry us.”

“No problem,” both replied in unison.

As the group readied their magical artifacts to activate the Cloud Azure Sect’s sword flight techniques, Wang Xiaorong remarked, “Your sect truly spares no expense, equipping disciples with such fine artifacts. I’m envious! When you return, ask if Cloud Azure is recruiting. I’ll join if they gift me one!”

Xiao Zhi chuckled. “Unlikely! These artifacts are rewards for merit. If you joined, you’d probably only receive a standard Cloud Azure Sword.” The group laughed, tension easing.

Wang Xiaorong’s gaze lingered on Si Qi’s jade ruyi scepter—a coveted treasure among female cultivators. The young disciple’s fortune in obtaining such a renowned artifact was undeniable.

Once prepared, Wang Xiaorong levitated effortlessly without any visible artifact, her feet lightly brushing the ground before rising.

After flying a considerable distance, the group finally emerged from the forest. Guan Yu pointed excitedly at a massive downward-sloping cave ahead. “We’ve made it! Is that the entrance to Black Blood Ridge?”

Wang Xiaorong, whose navigation had proven impeccable, placed a finger to her lips. “From now on, not a word. Follow my lead.”

They entered the cave unchallenged, the Black Blood Sect’s confidence in their outer defenses evident. Yet the labyrinthine tunnels soon bewildered them with identical branching paths.

“We must find where Xiaotong is held,” Wang Xiaorong whispered. “Split up, but stay silent.”

Dividing into teams—Xiao Zhi with A Ze, Second to Wolf alone, Guan Yu with Si Qi, and Wang Xiaorong solo—they ventured into the maze.

Guan Yu, noting worn paths and footprints, guided Si Qi toward a bustling cavern where Black Blood disciples gambled loudly. A man lounged on a stone bed nearby. Avoiding detection, they pressed deeper until two guards halted them.

“Who are you? What’s your business here?”

“We lost all our silver gambling,” Guan Yu lied, bowing. “Just looking for ways to recoup losses.”

One guard smirked. “Typical. But this area’s restricted. Move along.”

Guan Yu pressed, “Any tips to earn quick coin?”

The guard leaned in conspiratorially. “The Blood Lord seeks a man named Guan Yu. Capture him, and rewards await.”

Feigning enthusiasm, Guan Yu replied, “But isn’t the Blood Lord already holding Guan Yu’s friend as bait? Why not parade the hostage in Qujiang City to lure him out?”

“Risky. Lose the hostage, and it’s our heads.”

“Then take an item from the hostage as proof,” Guan Yu countered. “Show it in the city, and Guan Yu will come.”

“Clever! I’ll inform the Blood Lord. Stay here.”

Guan Yu intercepted him. “We’re new recruits—may we glimpse the Blood Lord? Just a glance!”

After hesitation, the guard—called “Brother Wolf”—relented. “Follow me. Stay silent.”

Traversing the tunnels, they encountered a towering figure who challenged them until recognizing Si Qi. Disguised as Black Blood disciples, Guan Yu and Si Qi realized this was Qi Shixiong—a Cloud Azure spy.

Brother Wolf, revealed as one of the Blood Lord’s lieutenants, led them onward. Unbeknownst to him, his subordinates’ lives depended on a lethal toxin—the Blood Lord’s failsafe to ensure loyalty. Those who ingested it gained enhanced abilities but required regular antidotes to avoid transforming into rabid bats.

As Guan Yu memorized the route, tensions simmered. With allies hidden among enemies and time ticking, the rescue mission hung in a delicate balance—where every whispered word could mean life or death.
