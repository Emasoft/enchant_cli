“Fuck, he said that no matter how many people I bring, he’ll beat me in front of them all! Come on! Let’s see how you’ll kneel and beg for mercy later! Severing your tendons would be too merciful! Damn it!” Jin Xing (Golden Star) growled through gritted teeth, clenching his fist with smug confidence.



Chapter 255: Who Dares Touch My Younger Brother

While Jin Cheng (Golden Success) was plotting how to viciously deal with Guan Yu, he casually turned his head and froze.

“Brother? Why are there so many people here?” Jin Cheng stared in bewilderment at the endless convoy behind them. People kept pouring out of the vehicles, flooding the entire street like a human tide.

“Huh? That shouldn’t be… Did you contact local gangs?”

“No! Maybe Dad arranged this? Haha… This is way too flashy, too over-the-top!” Jin Cheng watched as more thugs gathered, his blood boiling with excitement.

*There must be hundreds of them! With this many, even their spit could drown you! Let’s see you act tough now!* Jin Cheng thought excitedly, grinding his teeth.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu was walking toward the school gate while answering a call.

The moment he appeared at the entrance, both Jin brothers in their roadside car lit up with anticipation.

“Brother, that bastard’s out!”

“Get him! Fucking now!” Jin Xing’s pent-up rage flared hotter. Gnashing his teeth, he yanked the car door open. Leaning on crutches and supported by underlings, he hobbled toward Guan Yu.

As the Jin brothers stepped out, dozens of men behind them coldly followed suit, closing in on Guan Yu.

Across the street, leaders of major factions huddled with their subordinates. Noticing the commotion at the school gate, their eyes sharpened.

“Hold back. Tell the brothers to keep weapons ready. Wait for my order!” Xu Kai calmly instructed his men, preferring to observe the chaos before acting.

Luo Cheng’s face flushed with excitement. *Big Bro’s making another grand move—even bigger than last time during the grand opening!*

Spotting Guan Yu from afar, Luo Cheng waved his hand, leading his motorcycle gang to rush over.

Feng Xin and other faction leaders noticed Guan Yu and Niu Le’s arrival. With a signal, they strode toward them with trusted followers.

However, the Jin brothers’ men on the roadside had already encircled Guan Yu’s group.

“Fuck, you’ve got guts showing up with just three others! Ready to die?” Jin Cheng snarled, pointing accusingly.

Guan Yu coldly scanned the Jin brothers before remarking, “Shouldn’t you two be hospitalized? Here for another beating? What’s with the entourage?” His gaze swept over the surrounding crowd brandishing machetes and steel pipes openly.

“Kneel and beg now, and I’ll spare your legs. Otherwise… I’ll beat you to death today!” Jin Xing hissed through pain, his face twitching as sweat dripped from his wounds.

Smirking arrogantly, he awaited Guan Yu’s surrender—but found only defiance.

“Beg? Even if you licked my boots, I wouldn’t spare you. I said I’d thrash you publicly again—and I will!” Guan Yu strode forward.

“Fuck your mother! Kill him! Chop that bastard!” Jin Xing roared hoarsely.

The surrounding men raised their weapons—

“EVERYONE FUCKING KNEEL!” Luo Cheng bellowed, charging across the street with his gang.

The Jin brothers whirled around to see Luo Cheng’s blade-wielding gang storming toward them.

*Huh? Aren’t these Dad’s people?*

Their confusion deepened as faction leaders from across the road marched over with hundreds more. The school’s front square turned surreal, engulfed by converging crowds.

“On your knees! Hands on heads!” Xu Kai barked. His men surrounded the Jin faction, pressing shotgun barrels to skulls.

“Who dares touch my younger brother? You? Or you?” Feng Xin stepped forward in a black suit, icy gaze pinning the Jin brothers.

“Line up against the wall! NOW!” Liu LaoDa (Boss Liu) roared. His men shoved gun muzzles against foreheads and spines.

A bald thug hesitated—

*Crack!* A rifle butt split his head open.

Veteran gangsters paled. Never had they faced such overwhelming force—dozens of blades and guns ensuring compliance. *One misstep, and we’re mincemeat…*

Chapter 256: You’re Next

Even the toughest men falter with guns to their heads—especially when hundreds surround them. The thugs obediently crouched against the school wall.

“You alright, brother?” Liu LaoDa asked Guan Yu gruffly.

The overwhelming support stunned Guan Yu. Students gawked at him and Niu Le, having heard rumors of tonight’s showdown.

The Jin brothers gaped in despair. *How? How does this nobody command hundreds? Is he some mafia prince?*

“Brother Lin! What are you doing here?” A pinned thug leader called out to Lin Xu.

Lin Xu—reserved compared to his cunning father—nodded silently at Guan Yu from the sidelines. Recognizing the thug, he frowned. “Di Lei (Landmine)? Why’re you here?”

“The Jins hired me! Had I known they were against N City’s factions…” Di Lei grimaced, trying to rise—

*Thud!* A boot crushed his knee.

“Stay down!”

Liu LaoDa raised a hand. “Let him up—since they’re acquainted.”

After brief talk, Lin Xu brought Di Lei forward. “This is Di Lei from L City—a misunderstanding. Your call, Brother Guan.”

Guan Yu shook Di Lei’s hand. “Since you’re Brother Lin’s friend, consider this settled. Take your men and go. But these two—” He gestured at the Jins.

“Naturally! Our mistake!” Di Lei hastily agreed, handing Guan Yu a card. “Any trouble in L City, find me!”

As Di Lei’s group retreated, only the Jin brothers’ original dozen remained.

Trembling on crutches, the Jins realized their doom.

“Thanks for the support, everyone. Let’s disperse now,” Guan Yu announced. The crowd gradually withdrew under wary public scrutiny.

Guan Yu turned to the brothers. “I said I’d crush you regardless of numbers. Let’s settle this.”



Chapter 257: Replacement [1]

As Guan Yu reached for Jin Xing’s throat, Feng Xin stopped him. “Not here. Too many witnesses. Let me handle them.”

“Trouble? They brought it. Best end it thoroughly.” Guan Yu seized Jin Xing, snapping his crutch. The gangster collapsed, screaming as his fractured leg hit ground.

*Thwack! Thwack!* Guan Yu battered the injured limb with a broken pole.

“STOP! PLEASE!” Jin Cheng wept. “He’ll die!”

“Begging now? Where were my demands? An apology by tonight? Instead, you came to break *my* legs?” Guan Yu sneered.

“I—I was hospitalized!”

“Yet here you are.” Guan Yu nodded coldly. “Let’s finish this.”
