“I, Wang Yanjun, have been with the Hu family for so many years and still retain some dignity. Naturally, I wouldn’t lie to you!”

Guan Yu would eventually need to be dealt with—sooner or later made little difference. Moreover, whether he could even survive the Song family’s retaliation remained uncertain. Thus, Wang Yanjun saw no harm in temporarily letting Guan Yu off. Having served as Old Master Hu’s guard for decades, his status was nearly equal to the patriarch’s, and he had the authority to make such decisions.

However, Guan Yu placed little faith in his assurances!

“Hah! You still have face? How shameless must you be, an elder of your age, to ambush me?”

“You—” Old Wang nearly erupted, but Guan Yu swiftly shifted tone. “But I’m magnanimous. Let’s consider that matter settled. Remember what I said—stay out of the Song family’s affairs. Otherwise, if I captured this fool once, I can do it again.”

With that, Guan Yu released Hu Zongze.

“Guan Yu…”

Hu Zongze’s face flushed crimson from the prolonged chokehold. The physical pain paled against his psychological humiliation. As the Hu family’s heir apparent and current president of the Imperial Academy Society, being manhandled like an insect before the crowd was unbearable. Trembling with rage, he glared venomously, yearning to tear Guan Yu apart, but Old Wang halted him.

“Zongze, return home.”

“Grandfather Wang!” Hu Zongze’s eyes burned red, his usual refined demeanor shattered.

Observing his state, Wang Yanjun sighed. A true leader required unshakable composure—Zongze’s current instability meant he had to withdraw, lest his future crumble.

“Zongze, come with me. Now!”

Old Wang departed first. After lingering resentfully, Hu Zongze shot Guan Yu a final hateful glance and stormed out.

His exit caused unease among the crowd. Seizing the moment, Li Bang proclaimed, “Even without Young Master Zong, we remain! Young Master Song, rest assured—I stand firmly with you!”

Song Shaoqian glanced at Li Bang in mild surprise, impressed by his apparent boldness. Unbeknownst to him, Li Bang merely postured—confronting Guan Yu directly terrified him. His goal was simply to gain Song Shaoqian’s notice, which he’d achieved.

“Guan Yu, delaying changes nothing. You brought this upon yourself by crossing my Song family!” Having gone this far, Song Shaoqian abandoned pretense, speaking bluntly.

“If Young Master Song wishes to invite Guan Yu as a guest, might I join?” Jiang Ziqi stepped forward.

“Jiang Ziqi! Do you truly oppose my Song family?” Song Shaoqian frowned, having assumed Jiang’s earlier stance was mere lip service.

“Heh! The mighty Song clan dwarfs my Jiang family—we’d never recklessly challenge you. But I value loyalty. Since you seek to take my friend, you’ll have to go through me first!” Jiang Ziqi met his gaze unflinchingly.

Song Shaoqian hesitated. Abducting Guan Yu already defied his great-grandfather’s orders. Involving the Jiangs would invite severe reprimand. He stood at an impasse.

At that moment, Li Xi’s cool voice echoed through the hall.

“Young Master Song, grant me face—let this matter rest here.”

“Li Xi, you—”

The greatest shock came not from the Songs but Guan Yu himself. Rubbing his eyes, he confirmed—it was indeed her. Shouldn’t she side with Song Qifeng?

**Chapter 1019: The Crown Prince’s Arrival**

Meeting Guan Yu’s intense stare, Li Xi stated impassively, “Don’t misunderstand. I merely wish to retain a competent business partner.”

“Whatever the reason, your support means you care. That’s enough for me.”

Though Li Xi always maintained shrewd detachment, her appearance now transcended mere partnership. Guan Yu recognized this, seizing the chance to tease her.

Li Xi merely lifted her exquisite eyelids dismissively.

“Xixi! Don’t you know who Young Master Song is? How dare you side with Guan Yu?” Song Qifeng exclaimed, feeling betrayed.

“Knowing changes nothing. Should I cower? Brother Qifeng—if you were in Guan Yu’s place, would you want me to abandon you as you suggest?”

Her retort silenced Song Qifeng, who snorted and turned away.

“Hmph! What’s one more Li family? Today, none shall stop me from taking Guan Yu!” Growing manic, Song Shaoqian’s frustration mounted with each ally defending his enemy.

“Is that so?”

A young man emerged, addressing Guan Yu: “My family’s patriarch says—so long as you stay within the law, he’ll support you unconditionally.”

Baffled, Guan Yu turned to Lin Lin, who whispered, “Zhou family. Their patriarch once commanded the Capital Military District. Though retired, their influence remains formidable across military and political spheres.”

Before Guan Yu could respond, more youths declared allegiance. Though strangers, their motives were clear—legacies of the Wen and Liu families’ accumulated connections.

Heartened, Guan Yu proclaimed, “I know you honor my grandfathers’ names today. Regardless, I thank you. This debt, I’ll remember.”

Some reluctantly complied, prioritizing local power over an outsider. Guan Yu’s acknowledgment eased their resentment, eliciting polite murmurs.

“You all dare oppose my Song family?”

Song Shaoqian’s face darkened. Earlier assured of victory, this coalition now threatened his plans. Though individually insignificant, their collective force gave even the Songs pause—proof of the Wen-Liu faction’s deep roots.

Trapped, Song Shaoqian couldn’t retreat without losing face, yet advancing risked catastrophic repercussions.

“Young Master Song, while I’ve no personal quarrel, familial obligations bind me. Withdraw your claim, and I’ll interfere no further,” one aristocrat declared, stepping back. Others followed suit, leaving few stalwarts—families owing profound debts to Guan Yu’s lineage.

“Song Shaoqian! I’ve always despised your pompous scowling—like the world owes you gold! Strutting like a peacock—pathetic!” A brawny man named Wang Dahu guffawed, thrusting a thumb at Guan Yu. “Now here’s a real man! Defying the Songs takes guts—unlike these cowards!”

Guan Yu smiled wryly at the backhanded praise. “My thanks.”

Wang’s outburst shamed many, yet none rebutted.

“Seems your reputation falters, Young Master Song,” Guan Yu taunted.

“Guan Yu! Don’t push your luck!”

Song Shaoqian inhaled deeply, addressing the shadows: “Crown Prince—what say you?”

Lin Lin whispered explanations: “The Crown Prince leads the clandestine Stellar Society—members span all classes but share elite lineage. Their influence rivals the Imperial Academy’s.”

Emerging from the shadows, the Crown Prince revealed himself—Li Shao, the noble who’d once poached Li Yu from Guan Yu!

“Brother Guan, long time no see,” Li Shao greeted amiably, ignoring Song Shaoqian. Beside him, Li Yu glared hatred—Guan Yu’s ruination of his previous gang still festered.

**Chapter 1020: Madman Song Shaoqian**

“Does the illustrious Crown Prince side with this outsider, bowing to the Wens and Lius?” Song Shaoqian pressed, anxiety rising.

“Shaoqian, I, Li Mufeng, act solely by my will.” Just as Song relaxed, Li pivoted: “Yet here, I’ll join you. Brother Guan—no offense, I hope?”

“Why would I care? You overestimate your importance,” Guan Yu scoffed.

“Arrogant fool!” Song Shaoqian crowed. “Even with these pawns, you can’t withstand the combined might of Song and Li! Your protectors’ families wouldn’t dare oppose us!”

As predicted, several defected: “The Zhus withdraw... The Caos too...” Soon, only Wang Dahu and minor loyalists remained.

“Hah! See your ‘friends’ scatter? This is the capital—without true power, you’re nothing! Did you think martial prowess let you dominate here? Naive!”

Mid-sneer, Song Shaoqian choked as Guan Yu seized his throat.

“True, I can’t rule this city. But did you think the Song name shields you? To me, you’re but an ant—crushable with one hand!”

Guan Yu’s grip tightened. “I won’t kill you—I’ll let you watch as I trample your clan beneath my feet!”

He hurled Song Shaoqian across the room, the heir crashing down gasping. The crowd gaped—flinging a grown man like a ragdoll defied human strength!

“Brother Guan, you’ve made a mortal enemy today,” Li Mufeng remarked, recovering first.

“You think I fear them?”

Li Mufeng smiled thinly. Guan Yu’s audacity—assaulting Song members openly—proved his recklessness... or confidence.

“But I never imagined you’re the Crown Prince. No wonder even proud Li Yu serves you.”

“A mere title,” Li Mufeng demurred, though pride flickered.

“Indeed. Maybe I’ll style myself ‘Emperor.’ How’s that, Lin Dong?”

“Suits you,” Lin Dong deadpanned.

Li Mufeng’s eye twitched, but he retained composure. “Jest while you can. Your levity may soon fade.”

“I’ll make sure he never smiles again!” Scrambling up disheveled, Song Shaoqian spat blood. “Long! Seize him!”

A silent youth stepped forward—Song’s personal enforcer.

“Resist, and I can’t guarantee your ladies’ safety,” Song Shaoqian hissed.
