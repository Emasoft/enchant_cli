“Hmph, you little slut, where’d all your earlier sass go now? If you don’t want me to hit you, you can spend tonight making sure I’m satisfied, and I’ll agree to your request. How’s that sound?” Yellow-Haired Monkey chuckled lewdly.

Chen Si’s eyes were filled with unconcealed terror as she shook her head repeatedly.

“If you want trouble, come at me! Don’t bully Sisi!” Wenya hugged Sisi protectively, her pearly teeth clenched.

“Hmm, having you pleasure me does sound like a fine suggestion!” Yellow-Haired Monkey stroked his chin thoughtfully.

“Keep dreaming! I’d rather die than let you have your way!” Wenya declared with unwavering resolve.

Yellow-Haired Monkey’s expression darkened, impatience creeping across his face. He spat and snarled, “Fine! Let’s see if your friends will just sit back and watch!”

“Brothers! Put some elbow grease into it! Beat them till their own mothers can’t recognize ’em!”

“Ahh!”
“Owwww...!”

The cries of pain from Tian Bo and his two companions grew increasingly agonizing.

“Wenwen, what do we do? They’re going to beat Tian Bo to death!” Chen Si cried urgently.

“Sisi, don’t panic. There’s always a way!” Wenya patted Chen Si’s head reassuringly, though her gaze involuntarily drifted toward Guanyu’s direction, accidentally meeting his eyes across the room.

Wenya’s heart skipped a beat—a tumult of emotions flooded her: panic, helplessness, and against her will, a sliver of hope.

Would he help her again?

But when she saw the expression on Guanyu’s face, her heart sank like a stone.

His face was cold and detached, showing neither sympathy nor any intention to intervene. He looked like a mere bystander, keeping his distance to avoid trouble.

**Chapter 875: The Cake is Ruined**

That icy demeanor was a bucket of cold water, snapping Wenya back to reality.

At this moment, she finally understood: Guanyu and she belonged to different worlds.

Logically, she should feel relieved. Yet an inexplicable sorrow lingered.

The last fragile thread of hope she’d clung to dissolved the instant Guanyu looked away.

Guanyu turned back to Zhao Jing’er with a smile. “Jing’er, make a wish and blow out the candles!”

The cake had been brought out earlier, but the commotion with Wenya had distracted everyone. Now, the cake lay in ruins after Tian Bo crashed into their table.

“But Brother, you...” Zhao Jing’er hesitated, her pure heart sensing tension between Guanyu and Wenya.

“Brother, won’t you help her?”

Guanyu shook his head. “I won’t humiliate myself again.”

Every time he’d tried to help Wenya—from their first meeting to clearing her of theft—he’d received nothing but ingratitude. The current situation proved it best.

Guanyu forced a smile. “Let’s focus on your birthday, Jing’er. Don’t let this ruin your day.”

“Exactly! Jing’er, tend to your own affairs. Others’ troubles are their own making!” Niu Le chimed in.

“Jing’er, make a wish! We’re all waiting for cake!” Wenqing added gently.

Zhao Jing’er nodded, her face blossoming into a radiant smile. She closed her eyes, made a wish, and blew out the candles to cheers.

“Jing’er, happy birthday!”

“May you grow ever more beautiful!”

“May you and Brother Guanyu grow old together!” Niu Le blurted, making Jing’er blush furiously.

“Jing’er, what did you wish for? Something about Guanyu?” Mo Lin teased.

“N-no! It wasn’t!” Jing’er stammered, cheeks burning.

Guanyu rolled his eyes. “Mo Lin, must you stir trouble?”

The group erupted in laughter, their joy contrasting sharply with Wenya’s plight.

**Chapter 876: Fury for a Sister**

The ruined cake shattered Jing’er’s happiness. Tears streamed down her face. “My cake... it’s ruined!”

Guanyu’s rage ignited. He comforted Jing’er, then stormed toward Tian Bo, who’d thrown the man destroying their celebration.

“You did this?” Guanyu’s voice was icy.

“So what?” Tian Bo sneered.

Without warning, Guanyu’s fist connected with Tian Bo’s gut, sending him flying. The fight ended swiftly—Guanyu’s fury left Tian Bo and his thugs battered on the floor.

“You’ll regret crossing Bear Lord!” Yellow-Haired Monkey spat blood.

Guanyu smirked. “Let him try.”

As the dust settled, Wenya approached, voice trembling. “Thank you.”

“Don’t thank me. This wasn’t for you.” Guanyu’s tone remained cold.

Wenya’s eyes dimmed with regret. “I’ll take my friends to the hospital. Be careful.”

Guanyu ignored her, focusing on the groaning Tian Bo. “Your boss abandoned you to please scum like Jiang Ziqi. What a loyal dog you are.”

Tian Bo’s eyes widened in realization—this man knew too much. The game had changed.
