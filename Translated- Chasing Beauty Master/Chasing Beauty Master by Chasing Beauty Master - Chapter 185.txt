Guan Yu suddenly felt a heaviness in his chest. Wen Qing had come to the capital just to see him, seeking nothing more than an embrace.

She had cast aside all feminine reserve, yet he still worried about others' gazes, hesitating like a coward. He truly didn't deserve to be called a man.

Abruptly lifting his head, Guan Yu gazed tenderly at Wen Qing and murmured, "What if I suddenly want to hold you again?"

Then, beneath the crowd's collective glare of indignation and envy, Guan Yu pulled Wen Qing into a tight embrace. Breathing in the fragrance of her hair, he whispered, "I'm sorry."

Wen Qing's eyes widened momentarily before reddening slightly at the corners. With a radiant smile, she said, "My husband truly treats me well."

"Enough!" Yang Yang roared, his face contorted as he glared at the affectionate pair.

Wen Qing frowned, releasing Guan Yu to glare coldly at Yang Yang. "My husband and I are catching up. What concern is that of yours?"

Yang Yang pointed accusingly at Guan Yu. "Do you even know him well enough to call him your husband? From what I've heard, he's entangled with multiple women. How can such a man deserve you?"

"Are *you* more qualified to judge him?" Wen Qing retorted, wrinkling her delicate nose. "My feelings are my own affair. It matters not how many women he has—so long as he acknowledges me as his woman."

"Wen Qing!" Yang Yang's veins bulged as he snarled, "Have you no dignity as a woman? How can you debase yourself like this?"

"Believe what you will," Wen Qing shrugged dismissively.

"Wen Qing, how can you treat me this way?" Yang Yang's eyes burned crimson.

"I never claimed to reciprocate your feelings. Your obsession was one-sided," she replied scornfully.

"You'd rather be his mistress than be with me?" Yang Yang's breathing grew ragged.

"Gladly," Wen Qing declared without hesitation.

"Whore!" Yang Yang lunged wildly, his palm arcing toward her face.

But Guan Yu would never allow his woman to be struck. He seized Yang Yang's wrist mid-swing, his voice icy. "You shall neither insult nor touch my woman."

"That slut deserves—" Even the usually composed Yang Yang lost control, but his curse died as Guan Yu's brutal kick lifted him off his feet. Yang Yang crumpled, retching bile, before crashing to the floor.

Before he could rise, Guan Yu was upon him again, boots thudding mercilessly. "I warned you not to insult her."

Yang Yang could only curl into a ball, his feeble resistance useless against Guan Yu's assault.

"Cease this!" A commanding voice cut through the chaos. The crowd parted respectfully as Gu Yuansheng emerged.

Guan Yu paused, recognizing the newcomer, and stepped back.

"Mr. Guan," Gu Yuansheng said evenly, "I hadn't expected our reunion to occur under such circumstances. As host of this banquet, I request you end this dispute."

Guan Yu's demeanor shifted instantly to amiability. "The fault lies with him. Out of respect for your event, I'll refrain from further...entertainment."

"Gratitude," Gu Yuansheng nodded before addressing the crowd with diplomatic platitudes.

Humiliated beyond recovery, Yang Yang fled after shooting Guan Yu a murderous glare. The spectators buzzed with astonishment—this young man had upended their expectations.

First appearing as their goddess's escort, then being claimed as "husband" by another beauty equal in allure. While others would thank heaven for one such companion, this youth flaunted multiple.

Most shocking was his brutal humiliation of Yang Yang, scion of a prominent family, now reduced to fleeing like a whipped dog. Gu Yuansheng's deferential treatment added further mystery—what manner of prodigy was this Guan Yu?

Now the center of attention, Guan Yu approached Wen Qing. "Apologies for trampling your childhood friend."

Wen Qing blinked coquettishly. "Husband, could you be...jealous?"

"Merely dispensing overdue lessons," Guan Yu grinned, rubbing his nose. "Some require repeated instruction."

"This marks your third public acknowledgment of me," Wen Qing tilted her head sweetly. "Your woman I remain."

"Always," Guan Yu declared without pretense. Her unconditional acceptance—regardless of his other entanglements—had dissolved his last reservations.

As Wen Qing nestled against him, she glanced pointedly at Li Xi. "Husband, won't you introduce your evening's companion?"

"Ah...Li Xi, meet Wen Qing." Guan Yu chuckled awkwardly.

Li Xi nodded politely. "I shan't intrude further," she said before gliding away.

Wen Qing pinched Guan Yu's waist. "No wonder you've neglected us in the capital—distracted by beauties. Poor Xiaojuan waits daily for your call."

"Why doesn't she call me?" Guan Yu scratched his head.

"You understand nothing of women," Wen Qing sighed.

Changing tack, Guan Yu asked, "How did you gain entry?"

"Where there's will..." she evaded.

"Did you come solely for me?"

Wen Qing's eyes glinted mischievously. "Perhaps to introduce you to my parents?"

Guan Yu stiffened.

"Teasing!" She laughed. "You needn't fear—I require no formal status. Your recognition suffices."

Guan Yu clasped her hand. "Name the date. I'll meet them."

Confident his wealth and abilities would impress, he remained oblivious to looming complexities. Before Wen Qing could respond, the microphone hummed to life.

On the raised platform, the host announced: "Honored guests, our benefactor Mr. Gu Yuansheng will now address us."

Applause erupted as Gu took the stage. "We gather to foster collaboration among exceptional entrepreneurs. This year's theme is philanthropy—true success lies in societal contribution."

He detailed transparent donation processes bypassing charitable organizations, pledging 100 million personally, with 1 billion over five years. "Upon retirement, half my estate shall fund charity."

Guan Yu marveled at such largesse, joining the thunderous applause.

As the host continued outlining donation displays and upcoming auctions, Guan Yu whispered to Wen Qing: "Gu traps these vampires splendidly. Their purses shall hemorrhage tonight."

"See anything desirable at auction?" Guan Yu offered. "Name your price."

Wen Qing's eyes sparkled. "Truly?"

"Your husband may not be Croesus, but millions lie within reach."

"What of your other ladies' jealousy?"

Guan Yu faltered before asserting: "Promises made shall be kept."

Wen Qing's gaze softened with contentment.

Circling the venue, Guan Yu noted either hostile or avoidant glances—his earlier spectacle bred resentment. Soon, digestive urgency struck.

In the restroom stall, Guan Yu overheard conspirators:

"Everything's prepared, Manager Piao."

"Excellent. We'll reap fame and profit from these barbarians," replied a familiar voice—Piao Xu!

Guan Yu froze. What scheme brewed? Emerging later, he spotted Piao harassing Wen Qing.

"Seeking dance partners elsewhere, *sister*," Wen Qing rebuffed coldly.

Undeterred, Piao leered until Guan Yu materialized.

"Frostbite lessons proved insufficient?" Guan Yu's voice dripped menace.

Piao's face twisted. "How do vermin like you infiltrate elite gatherings?"

Guan Yu smiled icily. "Let's demonstrate proper...hospitality."
