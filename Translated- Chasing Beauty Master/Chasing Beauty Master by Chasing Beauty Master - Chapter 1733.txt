When no one spoke, Guan Yu continued, “In truth, Xiaomei allied with the Jia Yi Sect to attack the Ha Clan for the sake of a supposedly mystical manual that doesn’t actually exist. That’s why she slaughtered so many of your people. Later, upon realizing the manual was a myth, she deeply regretted her actions.

“But by then, she was trapped in a dilemma, unsure how to proceed. Thus, she asked me to act as mediator. She’s willing to unconditionally release all hostages on the condition that the feud between the Jia Yi Sect and the Ha Clan be permanently settled. Henceforth, neither side shall provoke the other, and all past grievances shall be buried.”

“Impossible!” Ma Zhagen sprang to his feet, roaring, “That damned bitch killed so many of our kin! She murdered Hadabei with her own hands! How can we let such hatred vanish like smoke? She’s delusional if she thinks this can be forgiven!”

The chieftain pulled Ma Zhagen back, signaling Guan Yu to continue.

Guan Yu pressed on, “Brother Ma Zhagen, please calm yourself and hear me out. This is merely a proposal, not a final decision.

“After my stalemate with Xiaomei, I lacked the strength to rescue all hostages by force. When she offered this truce and agreed to release the captives, I accepted immediately. Personally, I support her suggestion. Endless cycles of vengeance only perpetuate suffering—today’s victor becomes tomorrow’s victim. Even if you retaliate against the Jia Yi Sect later, victory is far from guaranteed. I understand your rage, which is why I’m offering this Beast Horn. I implore you to sheath your swords and let this conflict end here.”

**Chapter 4533: Resentment**

After Guan Yu’s words, silence fell. Ma Zhagen remained vehemently opposed, and even the old chieftain—who had witnessed Xiaomei slaughtering his clansmen firsthand—seemed reluctant.

Yet the crux lay in Guan Yu’s possession of the Beast Horn, the Ha Clan’s sacred totem. By saving their tribe, Guan Yu had earned the right to wield this symbol of ultimate authority. Though it granted him one unrefusable demand from the Ha people, this request tested their limits.

Ma Zhagen stood again, demanding, “Guan Yu, are you speaking for the Jia Yi Sect now? How can you trust that witch? Suppose we agree to peace, only for her to betray us later? We’d be nurturing a viper in our bosom!”

“I swear such betrayal won’t occur,” Guan Yu replied. “Our truce includes her guiding me to Miao City. She’ll be absent for some time. Moreover, you should know—Xiaomei isn’t human. She’s a snake demon who cultivated human form. Her future is unpredictable, making reconciliation the wisest path.”

Ma Zhagen paled upon learning he’d loved a serpent for so long—a revelation both absurd and revolting.

As tensions simmered, the old chieftain rose. “Ordinarily, I’d never consent. But Guan Yu saved us all. For that, we owe him our gratitude.”

Gesturing to the whole roasted bull—their highest honor for guests—he added, “Though reluctant, Guan Yu holds the Beast Horn, binding us to fulfill one demand. If resentment lingers, direct it at me. I decree this feud ends now. Let peace replace bloodshed.”

“Moreover,” the chieftain continued, “this ordeal has weakened us. We must rebuild unity. In time, the Ha Clan shall rise again!”

Cheers erupted, signaling the matter’s resolution. Though many still harbored bitterness, time would heal wounds. Guan Yu hesitated to return the Beast Horn, sensing future utility, but current necessity demanded its use.

By midnight, only bones remained of the feast. Siqi lingered beside Guan Yu while the chieftain and Ma Zhagen stayed, others having retired.

Drunk and slurring, Ma Zhagen declared, “Guan Yu... I respect you most. If nothing else, your drinking prowess is unmatched!”

“You flatter me,” Guan Yu chuckled privately. Unaccustomed to the fermented mare’s milk liquor, he’d discreetly expelled the alcohol using inner energy, remaining sober.

Pointing to the ancient well behind the chieftain, Guan Yu asked, “This well must be ancient?”

Nodding, the old leader reminisced, “When I led our remnants here during exile, we found this well and a human-shaped fruit tree. The potable water decided our settlement. Through great effort, we built this wooden tower, gradually rebuilding our clan.”

Mellowed by drink, he sighed, “I remember when Jianghu enemies hunted us. We arrived with fewer than twenty survivors—from a once-thousand-strong clan. Young and inexperienced, I could only flee with my people. Those days... unforgettable.”

Uninterested in further Ha history, Guan Yu inquired, “Why do rumors persist about your clan’s secret manuals? Such tales invited the Jia Yi Sect’s attack.”

“Envy,” the chieftain answered. “Other tribes noticed our warriors grow stronger yearly, our lifespans exceeding norms. Lies spread from jealousy.”

Ma Zhagen spat, “So those Jia Yi bastards attacked, burning and killing! Hateful vermin!”

Guan Yu probed, “But without manuals, how did your people grow so robust? Is it the well... or that tree?”

The chieftain stiffened.

**Chapter 4534: Impropriety**

As their savior, Guan Yu warranted trust. The chieftain admitted, “Initially, we noticed nothing. Only later did I realize—the well’s waters must cause these changes.”

“More dangerous than any manual,” Guan Yu observed.

“Precisely,” the chieftain agreed. “I knew rumors would bring disaster. How could I announce our secret? If word spread, we’d face endless raids.”

His voice heavy, he added, “Desert life offers little peace.”

Guan Yu consoled, “With the Jia Yi Sect neutralized, smaller groups won’t challenge you. Rebuild in safety.”

Indeed, the miraculous well posed a double-edged sword—its waters enhancing strength and longevity. Exposure risked catastrophe.

“The secret won’t keep,” the chieftain fretted. “We must grow powerful enough to protect it.”

Guan Yu nodded. In this lawless land, might ruled. Treasures belonged to the strong.

Late that night, Siqi questioned Guan Yu in their tent: “How did you convince that sect leader? A true stalemate? Improbable.”

“Astute as ever,” Guan Yu grinned. “That minor demon was no match. She proposed the truce—I accepted to avoid prolonged fighting. Rescuing hostages came first. Had the Ha Clan refused peace, their feud would’ve continued independently.”

“Why not capture her?” Siqi pressed. “Forcing her to guide us risks betrayal in the desert.”

“Exactly,” Guan Yu agreed. “Voluntary cooperation is safer. With her knowledge, finding Miao City becomes feasible.”

**Chapter 4535: Feigned Illness**

At dawn, the Ha Clan bid farewell with gifts of human-shaped fruits—precious desert luxuries. Guan Yu resolved to later study the enigmatic well.

Arriving at the Jia Yi Sect’s camp, they found Xiaomei waiting. “You kept your word,” Guan Yu noted.

“As did you,” the snake demon smiled, eyeing Siqi. “I’ll guide you to Miao City.”

Secretly, Xiaomei plotted to claim the legendary Eight-Drum Technique for herself during the journey. She also aimed to seduce Guan Yu, confident in her charms despite his companion.

Noticing dismantled tents, Guan Yu asked, “Relocating?”

“Returning to our riverside settlement,” Xiaomei replied, mounting a camel. “Let’s depart.”

Suddenly, she gasped, clutching her side dramatically.
