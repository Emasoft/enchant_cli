“That girl Xiao Mei isn’t just shrewd; she also strikes me as quite cunning. She may look young and inexperienced in major matters, but her vigilance is remarkably high,” Wang Jun remarked.

Guan Yu flicked his sleeve dismissively. “Who cares about distinguishing between good and bad? When the time comes, we’ll just take what we need. As for Xiao Mei, if she wants to make such a fuss, let her. You can’t rein her in anyway. But I think my ideas still hold great promise.”

The group set off toward the Jia Yi Sect. The distance didn’t seem far, but without camels, they had to trek on foot.

Some had kept their wooden sandals, which proved useful in the desert. Others, however, had left theirs on the camels—now lost—forcing them to walk barefoot.

“Xiao Mei, how far is the Jia Yi Sect from here?” Guan Yu asked.

“About two hours’ journey,” Xiao Mei replied, her expression tinged with worry.

“That long? It didn’t seem so distant before,” Guan Yu pressed, suspecting deceit.

“You wouldn’t understand. Though the distance is short, navigating the shifting sands slows us. The terrain has changed, and I must constantly adjust our course. Do you think this is easy? Stop making thoughtless remarks.”

Though flight techniques could have been used, exhaustion from the storm had drained their spiritual energy, leaving them no choice but to walk.

Noticing Xiao Mei’s unease, Guan Yu inquired, “What’s troubling you?”

She glanced at him, her tension easing slightly. “I’m concerned about the sect. After that storm, I don’t know the extent of the damage. If losses are severe, repairs will take time.”

Guan Yu nodded. His group had lost everything but their lives. If the sect’s camels had perished, their journey would grow even more arduous.

After nearly two hours, the Jia Yi Sect came into view. From a distance, it appeared intact, spared the storm’s worst fury.

Relieved, Xiao Mei smiled. “This is my territory. The sect lies ahead. Let’s hurry—food and drink await.”

Her words reminded them of their thirst. The humid air had helped earlier, but the midday sun now sapped their strength.

Upon arrival, they found the sect unharmed. The previous night’s tempest had barely touched it.

Sect members spotted their approach and rushed to greet Xiao Mei. “Welcome back, Sect Leader,” they bowed.

Xiao Mei nodded, her worries fading. “Last night’s storm was fierce. Was there much damage?”

“None, Sect Leader. The storm wasn’t severe here. Only a tent tore, but we repaired it at dawn,” a disciple answered.

Guan Yu frowned. “Not severe? That storm nearly destroyed us!”

The disciple glanced at Xiao Mei. “Sect Leader, who are these…?”

“They’re my guests. But explain—why do you claim the storm wasn’t dire?”

“The northern skies bore the worst, with tornadoes. We were far from the center, so the winds and rain here were milder.”

The group realized they’d endured the storm’s epicenter. The sect’s reinforced tents had withstood the peripheral fury.

Guan Yu grimaced. Misfortune seemed to follow Xiao Mei. Had they stayed with the Ha Tribe, they might have avoided this calamity. Now, camels and supplies were gone, forcing them to restock here—at fifty taels per camel.

**Chapter 4565: Straightforward**

Resigned, Guan Yu accepted the cost. Xiao Mei’s lack of hospitality irked him. “Shouldn’t you offer us water and rest?” he prodded.

“Ah, forgive me,” Xiao Mei chuckled, mindful of the eight hundred taels he owed. She ordered disciples to lodge and feast the group.

After eating, Siqi suggested resting. As they settled, a voice called from outside: “The Sect Leader requests your presence.”

In Xiao Mei’s tent, they found her discussing with her sister. “We have forty camels. You need sixteen?” she cut to the chase.

“Yes, and ensure they’re sturdy. At fifty taels each, I won’t pay for feeble ones.”

“Our camels are the desert’s finest,” Xiao Mei vowed.

“Then prepare them. I’ll inspect before payment.”

“Deal. Eight hundred taels—cash on delivery.”

Guan Yu produced silver notes. Xiao Mei’s eyes gleamed, but he withdrew them. “Payment comes when the camels are ready.”

Suppressing irritation, she agreed. Guan Yu knew she’d now tend the camels meticulously.

Back in their tent, Siqi worried: “Provoking her here—is it wise?”

“She’ll wait for the silver. Stay vigilant, but I trust her greed over rashness.”

**Chapter 4566: Sincere Intentions**

The next morning, Xiao Mei summoned Guan Yu to breakfast. “Your camels are being pampered,” she assured.

“We need supplies—clothes, tents,” Guan Yu pressed.

Xiao Mei hesitated, then relented: “As a gesture of goodwill, I’ll provide them freely.”

Guan Yu accepted, selecting sturdy tents and sect robes for disguise. With their new gear, the group blended in, ready for the challenges ahead.
