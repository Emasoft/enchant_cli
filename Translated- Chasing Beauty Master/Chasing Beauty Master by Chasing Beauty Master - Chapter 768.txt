“Rest assured, rest assured, I won’t go anywhere…” Director Qiu, thoroughly intimidated by Guan Yu, replied with fearful caution.

Guan Yu donned the white coat, now indistinguishable from hospital staff, and led Qing Ling’er out of Director Qiu’s office.

“Benefactor, are you looking for Du Zhao?” Qing Ling’er tilted her head and asked.

“Yes. I’ll need your help to get to him later,” Guan Yu replied.

“I know which ward he’s in. I’ll take you there.” Qing Ling’er’s voice still trembled slightly from lingering fear.

Guan Yu nodded. Dressed as a doctor with a nurse accompanying him, bypassing the police would be easier.

Du Zhao was in Room 525. As they approached under Qing Ling’er’s guidance, a lone policeman slouched on a wooden stool near the door. Guan Yu frowned—only one guard? Had he known earlier, he wouldn’t have gone through such elaborate measures. Still, at least he’d played the hero rescuing a beauty.

The drowsy policeman snapped to attention as they approached. “What’s your business here?”

“Oh, the patient in this ward has severe injuries requiring immediate examination,” Qing Ling’er answered nervously.

The officer scrutinized them—a young, pretty nurse who’d tended the ward all day. “Go in.”

They slipped past. Qing Ling’er opened the door to a private suite equipped with top-tier medical facilities, befitting Du Zhao’s privileged status.

Guan Yu removed his cap, approaching the soundly sleeping Du Zhao. Moonlight glinted off the silver dagger—Yang Conghan’s blade—as he pressed it to the man’s neck.

A cold edge jolted Du Zhao awake. His eyes widened in terror at the sight above him. “Want to live? Stay quiet,” Guan Yu murmured, lifting the blade.

“Calling the cops on me? Ambitious.” Du Zhao trembled, baffled how Guan Yu had breached police security. Those useless officers outside!

Qing Ling’er stood frozen, barely breathing. One slip of the razor-sharp dagger would end everything.

“Guan Yu! This is a lawful society! You wouldn’t murder me!” Du Zhao forced courage through clenched teeth, the blade grazing his throat.

“Exactly. With nowhere left to hide, I’ve come to settle accounts.” Guan Yu’s glacial tone sent shivers through Du Zhao, who now saw death in those eyes.

“W-we’ve no mortal feud! Let’s drop this! I’ll retract everything!” Du Zhao blubbered, crocodile tears glistening.

“Good. I’d hate mutual destruction.” Guan Yu withdrew the blade. “But betray this, and I’ll send your corpse home in pieces.”

“I swear! I’ll tell the police someone else attacked me!” Du Zhao babbled promises. As Guan Yu and Qing Ling’er exited, Du Zhao’s face twisted in silent rage: Just you wait, Guan Yu. I’ll have you quartered!

Back at the nurses’ station, Guan Yu removed his coat. “Let’s go.”

“Go? Where?” Qing Ling’er blinked.

“Leave this den of wolves. Will you stay after tonight?” His gaze softened.

Qing Ling’er’s expression dimmed. Director Qiu’s depravity had shattered her illusions. Yet resigning meant abandoning her dream of becoming a certified nurse. Still, roads open before travelers. Resolved, she changed into civilian clothes—a black miniskirt accentuating porcelain legs—and followed Guan Yu into the night.

At nearly 2 AM, Guan Yu drove his Da Hang, glancing at his passenger. “Hungry? My treat.”

“Benefactor, I should be hosting you—”

“Enough ‘Benefactor.’ Call me Guan Yu. Or Guan-ge.”

“I’m Qing Ling’er,” she whispered, cheeks blooming crimson.

“Why blush? The name suits you—ethereal as a spirit, radiant as sunshine.” Her face burned hotter.

Sensing her wariness, Guan Yu offered: “If uncomfortable, I’ll take you home. Where do you live?”

“N-no! Forgive my doubts—Director Qiu… Let me treat you as thanks!”

At a 24-hour barbecue joint, Qing Ling’er relaxed over skewers. Between bites, Guan Yu learned her harsh reality: a single mother’s struggle, a father lost in clan wars, nursing school sacrifices.

“Order more! Don’t hold back,” she urged.

“Enough. Waste is shameful,” Guan Yu said, savoring the spread.

“Ever considered other work? Accounting perhaps?”

She shook her head. “No qualifications.”

“Leave it to me.” He took her number, promising stable employment within days.

Post-meal dilemmas arose: her dorm was inaccessible at 3 AM. Neither Yang Conghan’s nor Xue Jing’s place would work. Solution? Pan Taisheng’s female-dominant apartment complex.

“Brother Pan, a friend needs lodging.”

“Female, I presume?” Pan Taisheng chuckled through mahjong clatter. “High-end suite available.”

At the apartment, Pan Taisheng grinned: “Qing Ling’er? A sunny sprite indeed! Only beauties trouble our Guan Yu!”

Pan Taisheng halted his mahjong game. “No trouble! This way.”

The secure women’s building housed Qing Ling’er in twelfth-floor luxury. “Rest easy here,” Pan assured.

As Guan宇 prepared to leave, Pan grinned: “Late-night rescue mission calls for drinks! My treat!”
