Since Guan Yu joined the class, the two had exchanged only a few words, most of which stemmed from Xu Ying’s delusional belief that he, like other boys, sought to pursue her. Beyond this, Xu Ying had shown no interest in anything unrelated to academics. Yet now, speaking of Guan Yu himself, she seemed to have endless words to share.

When Xu Ying heard Guan Yu inquire about Liu Shilei’s spouse, her eyes lit up with excitement. “My family deals in automotive trade,” she declared loudly. “The enterprise of Principal Liu’s spouse has grown into one of Huaxia’s top ten conglomerates, spanning nearly every industry. Our Xu Group serves as their regional automotive distributor in Y City. Last time Madam Du visited Y City, my father hosted her for dinner—I even met her! Can you imagine? Though her beloved vanished twenty years ago, Madam Du remains CEO of Huanyu Group. The chairman’s title still bears her spouse’s name. Twenty years of unwavering devotion... How I envy them!”

As she spoke, stars seemed to dance in Xu Ying’s eyes. Class 1-6 students crowded around, their familiarity with Huanyu Group evident. Guan Yu marveled inwardly—in two decades, Du Xiaojuan had transformed her enterprise into a national titan.

Yang Lin, seemingly unfamiliar with the conglomerate, noted Xu Ying’s uncharacteristic volubility. “What’s the chairman’s name?” he asked. “Tell us more.”

Xu Ying turned abruptly to Guan Yu beside her, batting her lashes dramatically. “I heard his name is Guan Yu. What a coincidence! Though of course it can’t be you—twenty years ago, he was already a Dragon Group member exploring Divine Ruins. If he were here now, he’d be over forty. You’re capable, but compared to that Guan Yu...” She trailed off meaningfully.

Guan Yu suppressed a bitter smile. To be measured against his former self, only to be found wanting... He rubbed his nose. “Go on then, Xu Ying. Enlighten us about this paragon.”

The self-study period—typically reserved for academics—morphed into storytelling hour. Xu Ying wove tales of Guan Yu’s past like a seasoned raconteur, embellishing his exploits into legends of a peerless genius traversing heaven and earth, combining wisdom with valor.

**Chapter 1661: Mutation Grades**

Over lunch with Liu Shilei, Guan Yu recounted the classroom episode. The principal laughed until tears sparkled. “After your disappearance in the Divine Ruins,” she said, “various departments assumed the worst. Stories spread through unofficial channels—Dragon Group used them to bolster their image and recruit adventurers. Who’d expect a schoolgirl to know every detail? She’s practically in love with the legend. That eternal youth of yours... Don’t tell me you’re tempted? Feel free to court her—Xiaojuan and I won’t mind.”

Guan Yu waved dismissively. “Xu Ying’s a child. Now, Sun Xiaoya... She bears consideration.”

Liu Shilei pinched his arm sharply. “I knew something happened during your stay with the Suns! Xiaoya’s our school’s prized blossom—it’d be a shame not to pluck her. Since Madam Sun insists you share a bed, why not visit tonight and...” She winked. “I’ve been lonely since returning to academia. When will you visit Xiaojuan in the capital? I’m coming along.”

Though Guan Yu could reach Beijing in half an hour, he’d delayed reunions, daunted by two decades’ changes. Yet Xu Ying’s account of Du Xiaojuan’s steadfastness moved him profoundly.

A familiar voice interrupted: “Big Brother! Dad said you’d be here!” Little Xue Jing appeared, accompanied by a middle-aged man.

The café lunch spot now hosted unexpected guests. Xue Jing’s father radiated power surpassing even Mu Yun’s—a high-level variant. He bowed respectfully. “You’ve saved my daughter twice. This overdue thanks finds you at last.”

Guan Yu rose courteously. The Xues’ “chance” meeting was clearly orchestrated—no surprise given their intelligence network.

As they settled, Guan Yu cut to the chase: “Brother Xue, you variants have hierarchies. You far outclass Mu Yun.”

Xue Jing pouted. “You call him ‘brother’? He’s your uncle!”

Her father apologized for her informality before explaining: “Globally, we recognize three mutation grades. Third-graders like Mu Yun wield ten thousand jin force. Second-graders triple that. First-graders...” He paused meaningfully. “A hundred thousand jin.”

Guan Yu’s brow furrowed slightly—first-graders posed genuine threats.

**Chapter 1662: Storm Assembly**

Xue Yingfeng had investigated thoroughly. This “student” bearing a legend’s name displayed preternatural calm and power. “Was it you who fought Mu Yun?” he pressed.

Guan Yu sipped coffee. “School bullies called in their variant enforcer. I obliged with a lesson.”

The older man leaned forward. “Forgive my curiosity—you’re no variant, yet you defeated Mu Yun effortlessly. Who are you truly?”

“Does the name matter?” Guan Yu countered. “I hear many variants are pardoned criminals. Does might truly make right?”

Xue Yingfeng nodded grimly. “A necessary evil. Their abilities are too valuable to lose to other nations.”

“Evil remains evil,” Guan Yu retorted. “Subjugate or eliminate—no third option.”

Xue Yingfeng’s eyes shone. “Then join me in Beijing. The authorities seek help against a variant syndicate—Storm Assembly.”

**Chapter 1663: Kitchen Incident**

The Storm Assembly, Xue Yingfeng revealed, comprised rogue variants and pseudo-supers. Their recent Beijing activities demanded intervention. Guan Yu agreed—building his own forces required intelligence.

Three days later, before departing, Guan Yu visited the Suns for Madam Sun’s treatment. Xiaoya’s chilly demeanor thawed slightly—her mother’s improvement spoke louder than words.

That evening, as Guan Yu prepared herbal remedies in the Sun kitchen, a resounding crash echoed from the courtyard—the Storm Assembly’s shadow stretched closer than anyone imagined.
