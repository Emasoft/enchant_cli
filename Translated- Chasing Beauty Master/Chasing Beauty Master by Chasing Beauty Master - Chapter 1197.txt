“I wasn’t playing around! I wanted to learn how to protect myself from Brother-in-Law. How can you call that playing? I don’t care—you have to lend him to me, or I’ll stick to him all day!” Xiao Zhu declared shamelessly.

Even Lin Zhonggeng, who usually adored the clever and endearing girl, chuckled and stepped forward. “Xiao Zhu, your mother and I really need to discuss something important with Guanyu. Could you lend him to us for a little while?”

It was unexpected to see Lin Zhonggeng coaxing her like this, but perhaps that’s how one had to handle children.

Xiao Zhu pouted. “Fine, for Mom’s sake, I’ll lend him to you. But when will you return him? Don’t take too long!”

Guanyu sighed inwardly. Since when had he become Xiao Zhu’s possession, something to be borrowed and returned? He wondered what this family even thought of him.

“I promise to send him back soon. Deal?” Lin Zhonggeng coaxed.

Xiao Zhu reluctantly released Guanyu’s arm. “Alright, I’ll wait here. Brother-in-Law, go with them for now. I’ll practice my throwing knives alone, but you *must* come back later to teach me!”

Guanyu followed Lin Zhonggeng to the parlor. “Take a seat, Guanyu. We have matters to discuss.” Nodding, Guanyu settled into a chair.

Lin Zhonggeng occupied the host’s seat, with Lin Qiaoqiao standing beside him. The aunt sat to his left, Guanyu to his right. Lin Zhonggeng and the aunt exchanged glances.

**Chapter 3072: The Thief**

The aunt spoke first. “Guanyu, I’ve come today to ask for your help. Would you consider it?”

Guanyu glanced curiously at Lin Qiaoqiao. He hadn’t been in town long—his fame stemmed mostly from the recent martial arts tournament for marriage. How had even the aunt, living far away, heard of him? Choosing caution, he replied, “Aunt, what could you possibly need from me? Please explain, and I’ll assist if I can.”

After a silent exchange with Lin Zhonggeng, the aunt continued, “My village lies over a hundred miles west of here. It’s small, peaceful—or it *was*, until a monster appeared months ago. At first, it stole livestock. Now…it eats people. We’re helpless against it. That’s why I’ve come to seek Brother-in-Law’s aid.”

Guanyu frowned. A man-eating monster in this day and age? Unheard of. Yet her grave tone suggested truth. “What does it look like? Has anyone seen it?”

“Yes. After devouring all poultry and dogs, it turned on humans. Recently, a group of men returning late from trade encountered it near the village. It was huge, covered in black fur, with fangs…almost human-shaped. It moved swiftly, snatched a man, and vanished into the woods. No one could chase it.”

Guanyu’s skepticism wavered. A beast resembling a human? “You want me to kill this creature?”

“Yes. Brother-in-Law mentioned your friend is exceptionally skilled. We beg you both to rid us of this terror. We long for peace again.”

Her plea, tinged with desperation, softened Guanyu’s resolve. Though reluctant to play hero, he couldn’t refuse her haunted eyes.

Lin Zhonggeng added, “This isn’t ordinary. My men might sustain heavy losses. With you and your friend, our chances improve.”

After a pause, Guanyu nodded. “Very well. I’ll see this monster for myself.”

“Thank you!” the aunt exclaimed, relieved.

Lin Qiaoqiao, certain of his kindness, declared, “I’m going too! I won’t let Guanyu face danger alone.”

Though uneasy about her safety, Lin Zhonggeng acquiesced, valuing her time with Guanyu.

“When did the attacks begin?” Guanyu asked. Monsters in remote areas weren’t uncommon, but cities seldom faced such threats. This creature’s boldness—escalating from livestock to humans—demanded justice.

“We should leave at dawn,” Guanyu proposed. “Every delay risks lives.” Privately, he hoped to resolve this quickly, though another call to Xue Jing was inevitable—she’d chide him for extending his absence.

The aunt agreed fervently. “The sooner, the better!”

Their discussion was interrupted by Xiao Zhu’s voice. “Brother-in-Law! You’ve been gone forever! I can’t throw knives without you!” She burst in, tugging his sleeve.

Her mother scolded, “Xiao Zhu! We’re discussing serious matters. Go play!”

“But Brother-in-Law’s teaching me knives! Once I master them, I’ll fight the monster!” Her earnest declaration struck Guanyu. So her persistence wasn’t mere play—she aimed to protect her village.

**Chapter 3073: Delayed Return**

Touched, Guanyu patted her silky hair. “No need to wait. I’ll go with you tomorrow to defeat the monster.”

“Really? You promise?” Xiao Zhu’s eyes lit up.

“Your cousin and I will both go,” Lin Qiaoqiao confirmed.

Xiao Zhu leapt joyfully. “With Brother-in-Law, that monster doesn’t stand a chance!”

That night, as Guanyu prepared for bed, Second Only to Wolf emerged. “Did you call Xue Jing? Don’t forget, or she’ll scold you.”

Grudgingly, Guanyu dialed. “Jing, I’m staying longer. There’s a monster to handle…”

To his surprise, she worried instead of complaining. “Be careful! Is it dangerous?”

“With Second here, we’ll manage. If it’s too fierce, we’ll retreat.”

After reassuring her about home security, he hung up and pondered. “What do you think the monster is?”

“Likely a man,” Second mused. “A human twisted by forbidden cultivation. I’ve seen it before—a vampire sustained by blood, cursed by his own power.”

Guanyu shuddered. Forbidden arts often exacted terrible prices. “We’ll see tomorrow. Don’t take risks.”

A knock interrupted them. Xiao Zhu’s voice whispered, “Brother-in-Law! Let me in—it’s cold!”

Guanyu groaned. “I’m asleep! Come back tomorrow.”

“I sneaked out! Please!”

He turned off the light. “You’ll catch a chill. Go back.”

Undeterred, she jiggled the locked door. “Men shouldn’t lock doors! I’m freezing!”

**Chapter 3074: Unwelcome Guest**

Guanyu stood firm. Letting her in would spark rumors. “Go home, Xiao Zhu. Now.”

She huffed, defeated. “Mean Brother-in-Law!” With a stomp, she retreated, leaving Guanyu to sigh. This family tested his wits as much as any monster.
