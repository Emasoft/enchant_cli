“The person capable of assisting Guan Yu must share an extraordinary relationship with him. Find an opportunity when Guan Yu’s absent and eliminate that individual!”

Li Yu interjected as a reminder.

This realization had suddenly dawned on him.

According to Chang Qing’s report, among all bets placed favoring Guan Yu, several sizable wagers originated from the same person—executed with such concealed methods and masterful skill that even Chang Qing, a man in his seventies, marveled at their sophistication.

This implied Guan Yu undoubtedly had a strategic mastermind by his side.

Li Yu’s objective was to destroy Guan Yu’s intellectual pillar.

By doing so, it would be akin to severing one of Guan Yu’s arms!

Dealing with a one-armed opponent would prove far simpler than confronting one with both hands intact.

Yet complexities abounded.

If this strategist were Guan Yu’s confidant, right-hand supporter, or even an intimate partner, the most likely candidate would be his woman—assuming the mastermind was female.

Consequently, Guan Yu would undoubtedly prioritize her safety.

Meanwhile, Li Yu wished to avoid direct confrontation with Guan Yu for the time being, preventing further losses to the Hao Clan.

This precisely explained his warning to Huang Zhongxing: strike only when Guan Yu was absent.

“Understood!”

Huang Zhongxing nodded solemnly. To reassure Li Yu, he vowed, “Brother Yu, entrust this matter to me. I stake my life on its success—I won’t fail you!”

“If you fail, your life ends here,” Li Yu stated impassively, his tone frigid.

Huang Zhongxing’s expression tightened. Gritting his teeth, he declared fiercely, “Brother Yu, should I fail, I’ll deliver my own head to you!”

This was Huang Zhongxing’s all-or-nothing pledge.

He knew full well his past transgressions warranted execution.

Since death loomed regardless, he might as well gamble his life for a chance at a brighter future.

“You have two days,” Li Yu pressed, intensifying the pressure.

With a dismissive wave, Li Yu sent Huang Zhongxing away.

Huang Zhongxing departed with resolute determination, his bearing reminiscent of a martyr.

Watching Huang Zhongxing’s retreating figure, Li Yu’s lips curled into an eerie smirk.

Strike first with a slap, then offer a sweet date.

This dual tactic was essential for those in power.

Li Yu’s display of lethal intent toward Huang Zhongxing aimed to fortify the latter’s loyalty and resolve toward the Hao Clan.

Only through such means could Huang Zhongxing’s potential be maximized, heightening the plan’s success rate.

History proved this method’s efficacy.

Presently, Huang Zhongxing’s sole focus was dismantling Guan Yu’s support network.

Abruptly, Li Yu’s smile twisted into something sinister.

“Severing one of your limbs ought to make you ache,” he murmured to himself.

The first morning sunbeam pierced the room, playfully illuminating Guan Yu’s face.

Sensing the sunlight’s warmth, Guan Yu’s eyelids fluttered before opening slowly.

A charming smile graced his lips as he stretched luxuriously, emitting a contented groan reminiscent of post-coital satisfaction. In one fluid motion, he sprang from the plush bed.

Observing his morning arousal, Guan Yu chuckled wryly.

Two days had passed since the underground racing incident. Having promised Li Xi to accompany her to Taiwan, Guan Yu shamelessly entrenched himself in her villa, refusing to leave.

Though the villa was spacious and the bed comfortable, the absence of a bedmate unsettled him.

For Guan Yu—accustomed to nightly revelries and amorous escapades—this proved an unwelcome adjustment.

With Wen Qing already returned to N City and the Taiwan trip imminent, his prospects for carnal delights dwindled, prompting vocal protests from below.

Smacking his “little brother,” Guan Yu quipped, “One day, our dear Xixi will understand your loneliness!”

Generously put, Guan Yu indulged in hopeful fantasies.

Candidly stated: he lusted after Li Xi but lacked the audacity to act, fantasizing about an illicit relationship.

Human nature—wealth doesn’t necessarily corrupt, but an abundance of women certainly does.

Midway through his solitary “playtime,” the door abruptly swung open, revealing Li Xi’s sudden entrance.

Awkwardness ensued.

Guan Yu stood frozen on the bed, hand retreating from his upright “little brother.”

Li Xi maintained her composure at the threshold, though a keen observer would note her crimson-tipped ears.

“Uh…” Guan Yu blinked, reflexively asking, “Need something?”

“I’ll return after you’ve… finished,” she retorted.

*Slam!*

The door shut with lightning speed.

Guan Yu’s face cycled through red, green, then black.

Red from embarrassment at being caught in compromising self-entertainment.

Green and black from indignation: since when did Li Xi barge into a man’s room unannounced?

Worse still—her parting remark implied he resorted to manual relief!

The insinuation enraged him.

As if he needed handiwork to alleviate loneliness!

Preposterous!

His harem might not number three thousand, but it certainly sufficed to satisfy any man.

With multiple beauties vying for attention, why would he bother with self-service?

This was outright disrespect!

Gnashing his teeth, Guan Yu stormed to the bathroom, violently brushing his teeth to vent frustration.

Suddenly pausing, he stroked his chin, a lecherous grin spreading. “I wonder if she heard my last comment. She must have… Heh heh!”

**Chapter 963: Targeted**

Post-grooming, Guan Yu descended stairs radiating renewed cheer, his smirk blending smugness and mischief. His swagger exuded cocky triumph.

This transformation stemmed not from self-relief but epiphany: why dwell on Li Xi’s misinterpretation?

Moreover, retrospection revealed Li Xi’s controlled demeanor had betrayed subtle embarrassment—a telling sign.

The implications required no elaboration.

Guan Yu’s delusions snowballed: mutual affection hindered only by pride.

“Heh, next time she mocks me, I’ll spank that pert bottom!” he mused, buoyed by imagined immunity.

Blinded by self-deception, he constructed an entire romantic narrative from wishful thinking.

He’d outwitted even himself—a master of delusion.

“Ahem! Xixi, what did you need earlier?” Guan Yu cooed, seating himself opposite Li Xi at the breakfast table.

Li Xi’s brow twitched imperceptibly. “Father left early on business. I have errands. Your plans?”

“I’ll accompany you, naturally. Why stay here alone?” Guan Yu declared, seizing the chance to test his theory.

Romance required nurturing, especially during his limited time in Beijing.

While his探查系统 (detection system) could unveil her true feelings, he preferred organic courtship—embracing love’s bittersweet journey.

(Of course, clandestine cheats remained an option when truly stumped.)

Li Xi fixed him with a stare. “I meant you’ll stay here. Understood?”

Guan Yu feigned ignorance. Had her earlier intrusion merely been a polite inquiry?

His cheek twitched, phantom testicular pain flaring.

Surrendering to house arrest? Never!

“Leaving me unsupervised here… isn’t that dangerous?” he purred, oozing innuendo.

Even a child would grasp his meaning.

Few could match Guan Yu’s seamless integration of words and salacious gestures.

Though cultivated and elegant, Li Xi battled the urge to slap him.

Inhaling deeply, she stated flatly, “My room has an electronic lock.”

“Windows suffice,” he leered.

“I’m shopping with Lin Lin. Joining us?”

The killer counterstrike.

Guan Yu froze.

“Shopping?”

Accompanying two stunning women? Superficially enviable,但实际上 (in reality) a nightmare.

The imagined glares of envy paled against the marathon torture of female retail prowess.

“Uh… heh. I’ll rest here. Enjoy yourselves!” Guan Yu backpedaled, waving goodbye.

Without a word, Li Xi exited—only to pause abruptly, whirl around, and march upstairs.

Baffled, Guan Yu wondered: Had she reconsidered to keep him company?

Unlikely.

Footsteps descended. Passing Guan Yu, Li Xi shot him a glare.

“I’ve deadlocked my windows. You’re locked out,” she announced before striding out.

Guan Yu gaped, then erupted into knee-slapping laughter.

Could she be any more adorable?

Outside, Li Xi’s ears burned crimson as she sped away in her car.

Unbeknownst to her, a tailing vehicle followed.

She’d been marked.

**Chapter 964: Ambush**

Downtown Beijing’s bustling commercial hub thrived with shoppers.

After meeting Lin Lin, Li Xi embarked on a retail spree, amassing considerable loot.

Unaware, she remained oblivious to her surveillance since departure—spearheaded by Huang Zhongxing, who’d staked out her villa for days awaiting this solo outing.

Watching Li Xi enter a café, Huang Zhongxing bared teeth in a predator’s grin.

“Boss,” a lackey urged, “we’ve tailed her all morning—no bodyguards. Her friend’s a looker too. My ‘little general’ could take her down. Let’s storm in and cap the bitch!”

“Cap your mother!” Huang Zhongxing slapped the man.

“Use your brain! This is the CBD’s 18th floor! Blast her here and we’re trapped. Jump now and save the cops bullets!”

“We’re here for profit, not suicide! Clear?!”

Huang Zhongxing’s life hung on this mission’s success—no room for error.

“Clear!”

The underling cowered.
