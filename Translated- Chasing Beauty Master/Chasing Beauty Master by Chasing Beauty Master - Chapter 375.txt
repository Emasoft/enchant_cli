As Li Xi spoke, all the information related to "the Haomen" gradually surfaced in her mind.

From the data she had previously reviewed about this underground dynasty, illegal street racing occupied a substantial portion of their operations. This shadowy racing world held pivotal importance for the Haomen, serving as their primary cash cow through gambling revenues. The rules appeared deceptively simple: anyone willing could join the track to compete. Yet only five slots were available per race – coveted positions auctioned at astronomical prices.

Of course, the entry fee wasn't charity. Champions stood to multiply their investment tenfold through prize money. This promise lured wealthy thrill-seekers to bid fortunes for a chance at glory. The Haomen maintained control by fielding three of their top drivers in every race – all equally skilled professionals who consistently swept the podium. Between track winnings and off-track gambling operations, the syndicate amassed staggering profits.

Guan Yu's plan to disrupt this cash flow required more than mere betting. To truly cripple the Haomen, he needed to personally defeat their three aces in a spectacular upset. If he simultaneously placed massive bets on his underdog victory through their own gambling channels...

"That wouldn't just block their income stream," Li Xi realized with widening eyes. "It could fracture their entire financial skeleton."

Guan Yu chuckled, tapping his nose. "Conversations with clever people save so much breath."

Though Li Xi's willow-leaf brows arched in confirmation, doubt soon clouded her features. "The Haomen's drivers are no amateurs. Their home turf advantage—"

"Didn't you call me the fastest driver you've ever seen?" Guan Yu interrupted with a wolfish grin.

"Speed alone won't conquer familiar terrain," she countered.

"Ah, but familiarity breeds complacency." His smile turned glacial. "When predators grow too accustomed to their hunting grounds, they forget to watch for traps."

Understanding dawned on Li Xi like winter sunrise. "You mean to recreate last night's... accident."

"Tiger's teeth?" Guan Yu's laughter held no mirth. "Why pluck one when you can take three? Let them nurse their wounds instead of plotting against me."

"Or provoke greater fury," Li Xi warned.

Guan Yu shrugged. "Either way, it buys time before my Taiwan trip. Speaking of which..." His eyes glinted. "How's our friend Wan Qianshan?"

"Predictable." Li Xi's lips thinned. "He'll dance to whatever tune protects his interests."

Their strategy session continued through dawn's first light, oblivious to the storm brewing across town. In a high-rise boardroom veiled in Cuban cigar smoke, Haomen patriarch Li Yu stared at newspaper headlines screaming about consecutive luxury car explosions. The charred remnants of eight vehicles and one top enforcer weighed heavy in the air.

"We proceed with the endgame," Li Yu growled through nicotine haze. "Double the prize pool. Take all bets. Let the sheep line up for slaughter."

An elder advisor cautioned, "The police—"

"—will remember who truly rules this city." Li Yu crushed his cigar into a crystal tray. "By month's end, we reclaim our throne on the mountain pass."

Morning light revealed two more burning headlines about stolen supercars. To discerning eyes, the pattern screamed war declaration. In a teahouse across town, Guan Yu inspected his weapon – a candy-apple Ferrari FXX K worth 15 million yuan.

"Showy," snorted his associate Lin Dong. "Useless for mountain runs."

"Perception shapes reality," Guan Yu purred, running fingers along the hypercar's aerodynamics. "Let the gambling masses see a thoroughbred. They'll bet accordingly... right before the underdog bites."

As the Ferrari's engine roared to life, its primal scream echoed through Beijing's concrete canyons – a predator's challenge to the Haomen's crumbling empire.
