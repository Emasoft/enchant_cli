Guan Yu finally felt reassured and continued fighting. He had initially thought it was an enemy’s stray bullet, but it turned out to be Jin Hua’s doing. She had no choice—after such a prolonged battle, neither she nor A’cai could land a hit on their opponents, while A’cai had already taken a blow.

Jin Hua reasoned that against overwhelming numbers, ending the fight swiftly was paramount. Seizing a moment of distraction, she fired a shot. Though her aim was off, striking the opponent’s leg, the impact was devastating.

A’cai seized the moment perfectly. As the enemy clutched their wounded leg in pain, he slammed a fierce punch into their face, sending them flying backward. The body collided with a wall two meters away before crumpling to the ground, unconscious.

This was Jin Hua’s first real gunshot, and she realized how difficult it was to control. The recoil of such a small pistol was unexpectedly powerful.

The gunshot stunned everyone. The men围攻仅次于狼 (Second-to-Wolf) froze in alarm. In that critical instant, Second-to-Wolf seized his chance. His long blade gleamed coldly as he swung upward, severing Gao Shen’s left arm in a single stroke.

“Ah—!” Gao Shen howled, his mouth gaping in agony. For a First-Class Adept like him, even a momentary lapse could drastically shift the battle.

Carathys sensed the tide turning. The remaining fighters groaned, desperate to retreat. With Jin Hua haphazardly waving her pistol, no one wanted to risk a bullet in the back.

Even Second-to-Wolf grew uneasy. He had zero faith in Jin Hua’s marksmanship—a stray shot could spell disaster.

Fortunately, Jin Hua refrained from reckless firing. Carathys ordered her men to pin down Second-to-Wolf while she moved to confront Jin Hua.

Knowing their lives hung in the balance, the men unleashed their deadliest skills in a frenzied assault on Second-to-Wolf.

Meanwhile, Carathys slipped toward the door unnoticed. Jin Hua aimed and pulled the trigger. The bang echoed, but even Jin Hua couldn’t tell where the bullet had landed—it seemed to miss Carathys entirely.

In a flash, Carathys vanished outside. Jin Hua shouted, “Guan Yu! Carathys escaped!”

Only then did Jin Hua notice a bullet wound bleeding from Gao Shen’s back. Her stray shot had struck him instead.

Jin Hua stood bewildered, glancing between the door and Gao Shen’s position—a gap of three to four meters. She finally grasped just how “precise” her shooting was.

Gao Shen’s misfortune peaked: freshly disarmed and now shot in the back, he collapsed, drained and dizzy.

**Chapter 2300: Sitting Down to Talk**

This was Guan Yu’s last resort. He knew their opponents weren’t just skilled cultivators—many carried firearms. When they’d risen earlier, Guan Yu had spotted the guns. While he and Second-to-Wolf could handle themselves, stray bullets might harm Jin Hua or A’cai. Thus, Guan Yu demanded all weapons be surrendered to level the field.

Weapons meant survival. Though Guan Yu ordered their surrender, none complied—his authority held no weight here.

Guan Yu smiled calmly. “I’m unarmed. This grenade? I took it from Chen Xiaona. Aim those guns at me, and we’ll see if it explodes.” His tone was light, almost amused.

Carathys stood farthest, but Guan Yu scanned each face. Fear radiated most strongly from her. To disarm them, her command was essential.

Carathys wasn’t the strongest here, but the privileged clung tighter to life—and superstition. Though distant, a grenade’s reach was lethal. She had no desire to be shredded to pulp.

“No weapons, no talk. Let’s skip to the fun part.” Guan Yu moved to pull the grenade’s pin.

“Wait!” Carathys barked. She couldn’t escape the blast radius in time. Nor did she doubt Guan Yu’s resolve—his steely gaze promised detonation.

Exhaling slowly, Carathys ordered, “Throw down your weapons.” Her subordinates hesitated, eyeing one another.

“Are you deaf?!” she roared, trembling with fury. “Throw them NOW!”

Gao Shen, ever loyal, acted first. His dagger clattered at Guan Yu’s feet.

“Good.” Guan Yu released the pin. Others followed, disarming reluctantly.

Guan Yu suspected hidden pistols remained but deemed them negligible.

“Lady Carathys,” he pressed, “surrender your weapon, and I’ll toss this grenade outside. Safety first, yes?”

He knew she carried one—Western nations lax on gun laws. Even Chen Xiaona had grenades. Here, illegality bred arsenals.

Carathys’ rage simmered. Gao Shen snapped, “You think a grenade makes you invincible, brat?!”

Guan Yu arched a brow. “Who’s this weed? I’m speaking to your superior. Or do you outrank Lady Carathys?”

The insinuation panicked Gao Shen. “I—I’d never disrespect her! Don’t listen to his lies!”

“Of course not,” Carathys said coolly. “I don’t heed petty provocations.”

Guan Yu smirked. “Such magnanimity! Yet your lapdog’s eagerness betrays him.”

Carathys seethed but yielded. From her leather pants, she produced an ornate white revolver, sliding it across the table.

Guan Yu pocketed it. “Thank you. A deal’s a deal.” He lobbed the grenade outside. Collective breaths hitched—but no explosion followed.

With the threat gone, Carathys steadied herself. Escape remained possible if negotiations failed.

“Speak,” she demanded, seated.

Guan Yu pulled a chair. “First, A’cai’s under my protection now. Harm him, and Chen Xiaona’s fate awaits.”

Carathys waved dismissively. “A’cai’s clever. Let him thrive.”

“Second,” Guan Yu continued, “release all trafficked captives.”

Carathys stiffened. “Absurd. Our livelihood depends on them.”

Guan Yu spun the revolver. “Then we fight. Winners dictate terms.”

Carathys laughed coldly. “By what right? You think barging here grants authority?”

“How about this right?” Second-to-Wolf’s blade hissed from its sheath, saturating the room with killing intent—the aura of a First-Class Adept. Any movement would meet instant death.

Fear gripped the men. Gao Shen, prideful in his skill, now dared not breathe.

Second-to-Wolf struck first—at Gao Shen. The latter dodged desperately, but the blade still gashed his chest.

**Chapter 2301: A Blade’s Feast**

Gao Shen staggered back, bewildered why he’d been targeted. Second-to-Wolf cared not—today, all were prey.

The room tensed further. Carathys masked her fear, plotting escape.

Second-to-Wolf’s blade danced again, but Gao Shen’s极限 speed narrowly saved him.

**Chapter 2302: Marksmanship Mirage**

Jin Hua’s earlier “lucky” shot haunted Gao Shen—now maimed and bleeding, his arrogance shattered. Second-to-Wolf pressed the assault, each strike a lethal whisper.

Amidst the chaos, Guan Yu’s voice cut through: “Last chance, Carathys. Release them, or this ends in carnage.”

But carnage had already begun. Second-to-Wolf’s blade thirsted, and the room reeked of impending bloodshed. The traffickers’ fate hinged on surrender—or becoming another tale of the wolf’s insatiable edge.
