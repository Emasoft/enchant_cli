“As the person in charge of peripheral bookmaking operations, Chang Qing understood better than anyone the direct financial losses this unexpected championship victory had inflicted on their Hao Men organization.

“Xiao Yu, the total bets placed on Guan Yu for this race amounted to 95 million. As per your earlier instructions, I raised the odds to 1:5. This means we lost 475 million on that alone. Combined with the 50 million we owe Guan Yu for winning the championship, our total losses reach 525 million.”

Heaven knew how much Chang Qing’s heart ached as he uttered that figure—it felt worse than death itself.

*Hiss.*

The moment Chang Qing revealed the number, all the higher-ups in the room collectively drew sharp breaths. The astronomical sum was utterly horrifying, leaving everyone stunned. Shock soon gave way to endless resentment and fury.

The fury was directed at Guan Yu. As for the resentment in their hearts—who it truly targeted—they dared only keep it buried within, unspoken.

Observing the reactions around him, Chang Qing inwardly sighed. He understood all too well that these 525 million represented only the direct losses. The indirect losses were incalculable; if tallied, they’d likely exceed 600 million.

What did this mean? It equated to a year and a half of Hao Men’s total revenue!

Losing so much in one blow—how could Chang Qing’s heart not bleed? A few more such incidents, and he’d likely cough up blood and perish on the spot.

If even *his* heart was dripping blood, heaven alone knew what Li Yu must be feeling now.

At this thought, murderous intent surged in Chang Qing’s eyes. He turned to Li Yu and said coldly, “Xiao Yu, if we don’t eliminate this brat, endless calamity will follow.”

In this moment, Chang Qing fully grasped the magnitude of Guan Yu’s threat to Hao Men. Not only had Guan Yu infiltrated their races unnoticed, sabotaging their core economic lifeline, but he’d also repeatedly eliminated Hao Men’s most capable agents—losses the organization could no longer endure.

Guan Yu *had* to die. Otherwise, who knew what devastating blows he might deal to Hao Men’s interests next?

Suddenly, Li Yu grinned—a smile brimming with indescribable danger and menace.

Chang Qing was baffled. He’d anticipated various reactions from Li Yu, even murderous rage, but never this eerie, sinister smile.

Li Yu spoke, his voice sharp yet gratingly hoarse: “Those who are greedy will never come to a good end!”

Chang Qing froze, clearly struggling to grasp Li Yu’s meaning. Was Li Yu expressing remorse over the catastrophic losses through self-reproach? But knowing Li Yu’s character, Chang Qing immediately dismissed this notion: Li Yu wasn’t one to wallow in guilt. If wronged, he’d exhaust every means to recover losses, not sink into despair.

“Xiao Yu, you’re…”

After a hesitant pause, Chang Qing couldn’t resist voicing his confusion.

“Uncle Qing, you’ll handle the payouts. Ensure *all* debts are settled in the shortest time possible!”

Instead of addressing Chang Qing’s question, Li Yu abruptly changed topics with a command.

Chang Qing paled. “Xiao Yu, that’s over 500 million in cash! If we pay it all out, most of Hao Men’s operations will collapse from capital shortages!”

Truthfully, Chang Qing loathed admitting this reality but had no choice. After a pause, he cautiously suggested, “Xiao Yu, what if we…default? This is underground racing—no legal protections. No one can hold us accountable!”

This proposal, though dishonorable, was the only way to spare Hao Men from ruin. It would also let them seize all betted funds, gaining a massive windfall.

If Chang Qing could conceive this, so could Li Yu.

Li Yu merely glanced at him.

But that single look made Chang Qing shudder, cold sweat drenching his back. He knew Li Yu was furious at the suggestion.

“Uncle Qing!”

As the oppressive atmosphere grew unbearable, Li Yu finally spoke slowly: “The reason Hao Men has thrived in Kyoto’s complex power landscape to become a major force—while not known for integrity—is that we *never* default. Doing so would make us the laughingstock of every Kyoto faction. They might even unite against us, driving Hao Men out of the capital for good.”

“One failure is bearable. I, Li Yu, can withstand it. Moreover, our racing operations’ profit potential outstrips all other ventures. We can’t let greed destroy Hao Men over a single misstep. Understood?”

Here, Li Yu’s gaze turned piercing.

Chang Qing’s face shifted repeatedly—he genuinely sensed killing intent from Li Yu.

“I understand!”

Ashamed, Chang Qing bowed his head, palms slick with sweat. Suddenly, he recalled Li Yu’s earlier words: *Those who are greedy will never come to a good end.*

Would his own greed one day give Li Yu reason to eliminate him?

Chang Qing’s burly frame trembled. He dared not dwell on it. Though senior in Hao Men’s hierarchy and privileged enough to call Li Yu “Xiao Yu,” this granted him no real leverage.

He smiled self-deprecatingly. *Serving a ruler is like serving a tiger.* Wasn’t Li Yu warning him not to overstep his bounds as an elder?

“I’ll handle matters immediately!”

Chang Qing rose and obediently followed orders.

**Chapter 956: Setting the Trap**

*Serving a ruler is like serving a tiger.*

Great leaders share one trait: keeping others perpetually guessing their true intentions. Li Yu was no exception. Whether through prestige or capability, he’d earned Chang Qing’s utter respect. From this moment, Chang Qing would shed his elder’s airs, replacing them with awe for Li Yu.

Just as he prepared to exit and arrange payments, Li Yu stopped him.

“Uncle Qing, wait!”

Chang Qing halted and turned. “Yes, Xiao Yu?”

“You miscalculated,” Li Yu stated bluntly.

Confusion flooded Chang Qing’s face. *Miscalculated?* How? He’d overseen racing bookkeeping for years, never making errors. Did Li Yu suspect embezzlement?

His expression darkened. “Xiao Yu, I’ve always served Hao Men faithfully. Do you distrust me?” His tone held reproach—he could accept a leader’s reminders, but not false accusations.

Li Yu raised an eyebrow. “Your loyalty is unquestioned. But you *did* err. We only owe 470 million.”

“As for the final 50 million—that’s the champion’s prize. Heh, since Hao Men began hosting races, champions have always received awards *here*. Traditions must hold. Uncle Qing, inform the champion: if he wants his prize, he must collect it in person!”

Li Yu’s “here” meant Hao Men’s headquarters. Past champions had all been Hao Men members, making this an unspoken rule.

Finally understanding, Chang Qing’s eyes lit up. “Xiao Yu…you mean to lure Guan Yu here?”

“If he dares come, I’ll pay. Whether he lives to spend it is another matter.” Li Yu’s voice dripped hatred.

A sly smile crept onto Chang Qing’s face. Now he grasped Li Yu’s plan: using 50 million as bait to draw Guan Yu into Hao Men’s stronghold—a place few entered or left alive. Eliminating Guan Yu would remove a major threat.

Chang Qing had to admire Li Yu’s cunning. But another concern arose. “Xiao Yu, since Guan Yu knows of us, might he refuse to come?”

“Never underestimate 50 million’s allure.”

Li Yu’s ambiguous reply discouraged further questions. Regardless of Guan Yu’s choice, Hao Men won: his death would secure their future, while his refusal would let them keep his 10 million bet.

Weighing this, Chang Qing left with renewed confidence.

**Chapter 957: Refusing to Enter the Trap**

At the Tea Appreciation Clubhouse, Guan Yu headed straight to a reserved private room post-race. Upon entering, he was greeted by a stunning, peerlessly beautiful face.

Li Xi leaned against the sofa in a red body-hugging dress that accentuated her devilish figure, her ample bust creating mesmerizing curves. Guan Yu’s hands involuntarily twitched, recalling when they’d ventured where no man had before—a memory that made him grin lewdly.

Unaware of his vulgar thoughts, Li Xi spoke languidly: “Hao Men transferred the 1:5 payout. Your 60 million bet netted 300 million, all deposited into the research fund as requested.”

To maximize Hao Men’s losses, Guan Yu had meticulously orchestrated this—racing himself while having Li Xi place massive external bets.

Guan Yu lounged, smirking. “Gotta admit, Hao Men’s efficiency impresses.”

“Any group reaching their stature in Kyoto has foundations. They’re not entirely worthless,” Li Xi remarked.

“Pfft!” Guan Yu scoffed. “Foundations mean nothing against pure profit. You think they’ve never considered shameless tactics?”

“Like what?”

“Defaulting! I bet 60 million, you 20 million—that’s 80 million total. They owed us 400 million! You think they’d part with that willingly? No way they’re that generous.”

Li Xi’s 20 million had been her own investment upon hearing Guan Yu’s plan—easy profit for a businesswoman.

“They’re not generous at all,” she unexpectedly agreed.

Guan Yu blinked. “Meaning?”

“They’re withholding your 50 million championship prize. You must collect it personally.”

Guan Yu leapt up, furious. “F***! What did I say? Those shameless bastards! A ‘major faction’ my ass—no integrity at all! Disgrace to our profession!”

Li Xi watched his tantrum impassively. Guan Yu’s selective outrage was impressive—Hao Men hadn’t refused payment, merely required him to collect it at their headquarters. But she knew: this was a Hongmen Banquet trap.

“What will you do?” she asked.

“Get my money! It’s mine—I’ll claim it!”

“How?”

“Loud and proud! Let’s see how they welch then!”

“Loud?” Li Xi frowned. She understood the risks; surely Guan Yu did too. Why take the bait?

“You’ve already taken 300 million from them. Why risk 50 million? Greed kills.” Her tone held admonishment.

Guan Yu smirked slyly. “Who said *I’m* going?”

“You’re not?”

“Since when do loan sharks’ bosses collect debts? That’s grunt work for underlings. Why keep lackeys otherwise—just for show?”

Realization dawned. “You’ll send Jiang Ziqi.”

“Smart!” Guan Yu grinned. “It’s his name on the race entry—only fitting he collects the prize.”
