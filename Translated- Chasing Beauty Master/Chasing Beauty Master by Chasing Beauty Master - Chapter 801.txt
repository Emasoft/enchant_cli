Madam Shen still felt the need to learn more about this young man, as it concerned her daughter's future. Since Guan Yu had already arrived, he naturally came prepared with appropriate responses.

“We haven’t thought too much about it yet. For privileged youngsters like us who want for nothing, there’s no need to worry about such things at this stage.” Guan Yu’s words subtly hinted at his affluent family background.

Nowadays, ninety-nine percent of parents marrying off their daughters prioritize the groom’s family circumstances. To these parents, this is the foundation determining their daughter’s future happiness.

“You’re right. You’re still young, and the most important thing is to focus on your studies. As long as Xiaojun’s safety is ensured, nothing else matters too much.” Madam Shen could tell Guan Yu’s family conditions were favorable.

“Mom, Guan Yu is amazing! He’s today’s citywide taekwondo champion representative. Without him, Kaihuang High wouldn’t have won the championship,” Wang Jun interjected.

“Oh? That impressive? Our Xiaojun’s cultivation isn’t low either,” Madam Shen remarked pointedly.

Wang Jun added, “Mom, Guan Yu’s cultivation is far higher. I’m no match for him even if there were two of me.”

“Is that so?” Madam Shen’s heart stirred. She knew her daughter’s cultivation level well—defeating several ordinary men posed no problem. If this young man surpassed that, his skills must be exceptional.

Madam Shen herself was an ability cultivator with unique insights. To verify her daughter’s claims, she decided to test Guan Yu during dinner.

“It’s getting late. The meal is ready—let’s continue chatting over food.” The group moved to the dining room.

The table overflowed with dishes—a Chinese tradition of honoring guests with abundance, regardless of appetite.

During the meal, Madam Shen prepared to assess Guan Yu’s cultivation. Noticing a dish of catfish stewed with tofu—a northeastern Chinese specialty—Guan Yu reached for a tofu piece. Simultaneously, Madam Shen’s chopsticks clashed with his over the same morsel.

Channeling her cultivation, Madam Shen wrestled with Guan Yu over the delicate tofu. Each time she nearly claimed it, Guan Yu deftly countered. A solemn expression crossed her face as she realized his prowess. Ultimately yielding, she watched him lift the intact tofu.

“Eating more tofu benefits the skin,” Guan Yu said, placing it in Wang Jun’s bowl. The moment it landed, the tofu crumbled into fragments.

Observing this, Madam Shen persisted, “Xiao Yu, don’t just eat—have some drink.” She flicked her beverage toward him.

“Mom, what are you doing?!” Wang Jun exclaimed.

Guan Yu swiftly cupped his empty glass, freezing the liquid midair before capturing every drop flawlessly. “Thank you, Auntie,” he smiled.

Madam Shen’s eyes gleamed—this display required lightning reflexes and precision. The young man’s skills were truly commendable, worthy of her daughter.

Noticing her approval, Guan Yu leisurely sipped his drink.

“Xiao Yu, your cultivation astounds me. How did you achieve such speed at your age? Any secrets?”

Madam Shen had anticipated spilled drinks regardless of his evasion, never expecting this immaculate interception.

“No secrets—just diligent training,” Guan Yu replied.

Overall, Madam Shen found him impressive—cultivation suitable for a son-in-law, coupled with handsome features. “With Xiao Yu’s looks and our Xiaojun’s beauty, your children would undoubtedly be stunning.”

Wang Jun blushed crimson. “Mom, what are you saying?!”

“Why be shy? We’re all family.” As mother and daughter bickered, Guan Yu awkwardly observed.

A tall woman entered—sharp-featured with crystalline eyes, clad in imposing black attire. Guan Yu recognized her—Wang Jun’s elder sister.

Spotting Guan Yu, she froze. “Little bro, you *tranny*, bringing a man home already? Changed your ways?”

“Who’re calling a tranny?!” Wang Jun retorted. “Where’ve you been ghosting these days? And why return now—embarrassed to be seen?”

Wang Jun feared her sister’s loose tongue—today’s boyfriend charade would crumble if Guan Yu’s other relationships were exposed.

“Guan Yu, why choose this manly *tranny*?” the sister taunted. “Crass-talking tomboy—no future there.”

Guan Yu marveled at their familial discord—far surpassing mother-daughter squabbles.

“Shameless *tranny*! Bring your own man if you can!” Wang Jun snapped.

Seating herself, the sister retorted, “Men? Useless. Not as brainless as you.”

“Enough!” Madam Shen thundered. “Fighting before guests—have you no shame?”

Housekeeper Lin entered. “Madam, Mrs. Zhou is here.”

Mrs. Zhou, Madam Shen’s close friend and mahjong partner, joined unceremoniously. “Rare to see both sisters dining together!” she remarked, eyeing Guan Yu. “Whose scion is this?”

“Aunt Zhou, my boyfriend. What do you think?” Wang Jun clung to Guan Yu’s arm.

Guan Yu gaped—Mrs. Zhou defied wealthy matron stereotypes. Weighing over 100kg with黝黑 skin and muscular bulk, she resembled a sumo wrestler.

Scrutinizing Guan Yu, Mrs. Zhou declared, “Meh. Pale twig—a breeze’d knock him over. No manliness.” Her ideal was burly, bearded giants.

Wang Jun’s sister chimed, “Aunt Zhou’s right. One fart’d blow him away—typical of Xiaojun’s taste.”

Bristling, Wang Jun defended, “Don’t judge by looks! Guan Yu’s incredibly capable.”

“Still see nothing special,” Mrs. Zhou sneered. “Looks reveal 80%—can he transform?”

Noting her daughter’s irritation, Madam Shen interjected, “Sister Zhou, Guan Yu might surpass even you.”

Mrs. Zhou flexed her wrestler-like muscles. “Prove it then—let’s see this pony trot!”

Guan Yu hesitated—besting her brought no glory, losing meant humiliation. Yet refusing worsened matters.

“Aunt Zhou’s clearly professional. My skills are superficial—no match,” Guan Yu demurred.

“Smart boy,” she gloated. “Else I’d knock your teeth out.”

**Chapter 2033: Testing Strength**

Madam Shen pressed, “Xiao Yu, as our Wang family’s groom, show some spine!”

Wang Jun protested, “Mom! Encouraging fights? What mother-in-law does this?!”

Ignored, Guan Yu sighed. “Very well—let’s compete.”

The group moved outdoors. Two ornamental stone pillars flanked the gate—30cm thick, 3m long, weighing hundreds of *jin*. The challenge: uproot and carry one to the villa entrance.

Madam Shen worried—Mrs. Zhou’s brawn versus Guan Yu’s slenderness.

“Don’t strain yourself,” she cautioned.

“I’ll manage,” Guan Yu assured.

Mrs. Zhou roared, heaving her pillar like a battering ram. Guan Yu lifted his calmly, hoisting it onto his shoulder.

Spectators gaped as both competitors lumbered forward. Though Mrs. Zhou charged fiercely, Guan Yu kept pace effortlessly.

Wang Jun’s sister watched mockingly, while Wang Jun fretted. Thirty meters later, Guan Yu’s steady stride matched Mrs. Zhou’s labored pace. The contest hung in balance—a clash of brute force against cultivated precision.
