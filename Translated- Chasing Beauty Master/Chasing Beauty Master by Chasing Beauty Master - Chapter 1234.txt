Guan Yu nodded, bowed respectfully to Master Jiu, then followed Xiao Dong. Xiao Dong led Guan Yu to a room in the rear courtyard. Though not particularly spacious, the room was immaculately clean and exceptionally tranquil.

“What an extraordinary place! No wonder all disciples yearn to visit the Ancestral Hall at the back mountain. The density of spiritual energy here is at least several times greater than outside,” Guan Yu exclaimed excitedly.

In the coming days, Guan Yu would begin his journey of immortal cultivation here, taking his first steps on the path of transcendence.

Though the room’s furnishings were simple, this posed no issue for Guan Yu. A bed and a table sufficed. After settling in, he prepared to rest.

Lin Qiaoqiao could no longer bear staying at Front Return Peak. Pointing at Second to Wolf’s nose, she demanded, “Tell me immediately where Guan Yu has gone! Why hasn’t he returned after so many days? There’s been no news at all—has something happened? Are you hiding the truth from me?”

Second to Wolf helplessly covered his ears. Lin Qiaoqiao asked these questions over a dozen times daily, driving him to the brink of madness. No matter how he explained, she refused to believe him, weeping and insisting on seeing Guan Yu.

“Brother Second, if you don’t let me see Guan Yu today, I’ll leave immediately with Auntie and her family!” Lin Qiaoqiao threatened.

Second to Wolf sighed. “Auntie would never indulge your tantrums.” No sooner had he spoken than Xiao Zhu rushed over, jabbing a finger at his nose. “Big guy, I strongly suspect you’ve colluded with people here to trap us! Guan Yu might already be dead by your hands—isn’t that right?”

Xiao Zhu’s wild imagination only heightened Lin Qiaoqiao’s anxiety. She clutched Second to Wolf’s sleeve urgently. “Take me to Guan Yu now! If I don’t see him today, I swear you’ll regret it!”

Second to Wolf felt truly cornered, nearly driven to death by the two women’s pestering. His ears rang with their ceaseless noise.

“Haven’t I told you a hundred times? Guan Yu is occupied with important matters—he’s learning mystic arts from someone and will return in a few days. Can’t you just wait here peacefully without causing trouble?”

“I don’t believe you!” Lin Qiaoqiao shouted furiously. “How could Guan Yu disappear for days without sending word? You’re lying! I don’t care—I must see him today!”

Xiao Zhu added, “Exactly! If you’re not lying, why not take us to him? Once we see Guan Yu, we’ll stop bothering you.”

Second to Wolf nearly fantasized about gagging the girls with his stinking socks after tying them up. “Fine! Follow me. I’ll take you to ask. If he agrees, you can see him. If not, blame yourselves for the consequences.”

In his heart, Second to Wolf cursed Guan Yu for leisurely cultivating while leaving him to manage these troublemakers.

Upon reaching the main hall, they found Chief Lu absent. Ma Xiao entered and inquired, “What brings you here?”

“We need to speak with Chief Lu. Where is he?” Second to Wolf asked.

“Master is having lunch. You may wait here—he should return soon.” Ma Xiao departed after speaking.

“Shall we wait?” Second to Wolf cautiously asked the women.

Lin Qiaoqiao and Xiao Zhu rolled their eyes in unison before seating themselves on wooden chairs. Relieved they’d stay quiet, Second to Wolf waited with them.

Soon, Chief Lu waddled in, belching and rubbing his ample belly. “Hm? What brings you here? Tired of your quarters?”

Before Second to Wolf could respond, Lin Qiaoqiao leapt up. “Fat Uncle! Where have you taken Guan Yu? Why hasn’t he appeared for days? Have you kidnapped him?”

Chief Lu started, taken aback by her fierce expression. “What nonsense! Brother Wolf, didn’t you explain things to them?”

Second to Wolf looked exasperated. “I’ve repeated it dozens of times daily, but they refuse to listen. I had no choice but to bring them to you.”

“Why come to me? Guan Yu isn’t here!”

Xiao Zhu approached. “We came so you’ll take us to him. We’re extremely worried—we must see him in person!”

“I’ve told you—he’s handling matters and will return soon!”

“Liar!” Lin Qiaoqiao retorted, hands on hips. “If Guan Yu were busy, he’d tell me himself!”

Second to Wolf glanced pleadingly at Chief Lu, who sighed. “I truly can’t help. Guan Yu is at the Ancestral Hall. Even I need the Sect Leader’s permission to enter. Your only option is to wait.”

“No! We must confirm his safety now, or we’ll search ourselves!” Lin Qiaoqiao declared.

Understanding Second to Wolf’s plight, Chief Lu proposed, “I’ll contact Guan Yu to return briefly. Meet him, then he can leave again. That’s the only way.”

“How soon?”

“Within two days. I guarantee it.”

After exchanging looks, the girls agreed. “Two days. If he doesn’t return, we’ll turn this place upside down!”

Chief Lu nodded grimly, lamenting being threatened by a girl. Only for Guan Yu’s sake did he tolerate this.

**Chapter 3172: Casually**

News spread like wildfire through Yunqing Sect that Guan Yu, the Sect Leader’s new disciple, had gifted the high-grade magical artifact Jade Ruyi to Siqi. Chief Lu nearly exploded upon hearing this.

“That ungrateful brat! I gave him my treasures, and he casually gifts them to some girl? Utterly wasteful!”

When Chief Lu and Sect Leader Xuanming arrived at Convergence Peak to investigate, Dai Chief explained, “Guan Yu gifted the Jade Ruyi to Siqi this morning. It’s already recognized her as master.”

“What? So quickly?” Chief Lu’s heart ached for his lost treasure.

Xuanming remarked, “They must share a close bond.”

Dai Chief emphasized, “Guan Yu requested Siqi escort him yesterday. This gift was gratitude.”

Chief Lu complained, “Since Guan Yu arrived, this sect hasn’t known peace! Sect Leader, his friends demand to see him within two days. Should we bring him back?”

Xuanming agreed. “Have him return briefly. Outsiders cannot enter the Ancestral Hall.”

**Chapter 3173: Unbecoming**

Dai Chief reconsidered matchmaking Siqi with Guan Yu upon learning he traveled with other girls. She resolved to protect Siqi from potential heartbreak.

Meanwhile, Yunqing disciples seethed over Guan Yu’s closeness to Siqi. Rumors painted him as a winged prodigy who’d confronted Lin Chen—a rare feat.

As tempers flared, Guan Yu’s return promised further upheaval. Chief Lu arranged for his retrieval, dreading the coming storm.

When Dai Chief heard Guan Yu’s friends included two girls, she abandoned thoughts of pairing him with Siqi. To her, Siqi’s happiness mattered more than any alliance.

“Let Guan Yu return to settle his affairs,” Xuanming decided.

Thus, Guan Yu’s brief homecoming was set—a spark destined to ignite fresh chaos in Yunqing Sect.
