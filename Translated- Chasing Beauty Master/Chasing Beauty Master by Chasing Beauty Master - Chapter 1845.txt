“After introducing myself, to receive such a response truly leaves me rather vexed,” Tang Muchen (Wood Dust) thought gloomily. The Tang family’s reputation was renowned not only in the capital but across many regions, their vast business networks and connections ensuring their name carried weight. Yet here he was, dismissed outright by this young woman.

Still, Tang Muchen wasn’t angered. Instead, it confirmed his suspicion: these two beauties weren’t locals of the capital. Hence, they hadn’t heard of the Tang family.

“No wonder,” he mused. “If they were from the capital, how could such stunning ladies have escaped my notice until now? They must have arrived recently, unaware of our family’s standing.”

“These pastries come in many varieties,” Tang Muchen said confidently, gesturing to the display. “The ‘best’ depends on personal taste. For me? None appeal—I’ve grown tired of them. But for you,” he added with a charming smile, “I’d recommend this one.”

He strode to a tray of delicate square cakes adorned with floral patterns. “These are quite famous, infused with the subtle fragrance of lilies. Most ladies adore them. Care to try, young miss?”

Qiqi, intrigued, reached for a piece, but Tang Muchen playfully withdrew the tray. “Why pull it away?” she pouted. “I can’t reach! Are they not meant to be eaten?”

“Of course they are,” he replied. “Everything here is complimentary. But eating alone is dull. How about a game first?”

“I don’t like games. Just give me the pastry!” Qiqi retorted, hands on her hips.

Tang Muchen, intent on prolonging the interaction, turned to Wang Xiaorong (Little Lotus). “And you, miss? What pastry do you favor?”

Wang Xiaorong eyed him coldly. “Your smirking face reeks of ill intent. It disgusts me. I’ve no desire to speak with you.”

Tang Muchen blinked, stunned. Never before had a woman rebuffed him so harshly. Even Qiqi stifled a laugh. “Sister Xiaorong, he’s quite handsome! Must you be so harsh?”

“Appearances deceive,” Wang Xiaorong chided. “Men like him hide darkness beneath pretty faces. Father warned us against strangers who overstep.”

Tang Muchen, undeterred by the mixed reactions, offered the tray back. “A mere jest, miss. Please, enjoy.”

Qiqi snatched a piece and nibbled. “Mmm! It’s delicious, just as you said—the lily scent is lovely!”

“See? I’ve no reason to deceive you,” Tang Muchen said, relieved at her approval.

The pastry’s delicate flavor was new to Qiqi. In the Demon Soul Sect, where rough warriors outnumbered cooks, such refinements were rare. The lily’s subtlety gave way to a rich inner aroma, delighting her palate.

Wang Xiaorong, however, remained aloof. To her, Tang Muchen’s smiles—unlike Guan Yu (Pass Universe)’s genuine warmth—felt calculating, even sinister. Since meeting Guan Yu, other men paled in comparison.

Undeterred, Tang Muchen pressed on. “It seems we share similar tastes, miss. A fortunate coincidence.”

“Not at all,” Qiqi countered. “Though this is tasty, I prefer the mung bean cakes over there. You’ve misjudged our tastes.”

Tang Muchen stiffened. He loathed mung bean cakes—they triggered allergies—yet here was Qiqi praising them. “Ah, many ladies favor mung bean cakes. Nutritious, sweet, and beautifying. You must eat them often.”

“Rarely,” Qiqi admitted. “At Sister’s home, no one prepares them. You’re wrong again, ‘Handsome Brother.’”

In truth, Qiqi’s childhood poverty had made even cheap mung bean cakes a rare treat. But her time in the Demon Soul Sect had introduced her to finer delicacies, shifting her preferences. Now, under the Demon Lord’s indulgence, she’d shed her rustic airs for elegance.

Tang Muchen, unaccustomed to such rejection, masked his frustration. A waiter approached, bowing. “Young Master Tang, a noble guest upstairs requests your company.”

“Can’t you see I’m occupied?” Tang Muchen snapped. “Tell them to return another day.”

As the waiter retreated, Qiqi giggled. “How imperious! Refusing an invitation so rudely.”

“When two such beauties grace my presence, all else fades,” Tang Muchen declared. “As a scion of the Tang family, I’d be remiss not to attend you.”

“We neither need nor want your attendance,” Wang Xiaorong said icily. “Leave.”

Nearby, Guan Yu and Chu Fan (Common Chu) observed the exchange. “Your ladies have caught Tang Muchen’s eye,” Chu Fan remarked. “He’s one of the capital’s infamous ‘Flower Princes’—the other being Cao Di (Deliver Cao), whom you humbled. Tang Muchen’s a silver-tongued charmer, notorious for seducing beauties. Aren’t you concerned?”

Guan Yu shrugged. “If they’re swayed by mere words or looks, they weren’t worth keeping. I trust their judgment.”

“Such confidence,” Chu Fan mused. “I once believed Jiang Xin (Heart Jiang) and I were unshakable… until reality intervened.”

“Hold fast to her heart,” Guan Yu advised. “That’s what matters.”

Guan Yu’s unshakable faith in his companions contrasted starkly with Tang Muchen’s calculated charms, underscoring a truth: genuine bonds outlast fleeting allure.
