“At first glance, this creature appeared to be an ant—a gigantic ant. Guan Yu realized the soldier from daytime had underestimated its size. Though reported as ten meters long, the monstrosity before them now stretched over twenty meters.

Its segmented body bore an extra section at the waist, giving it an almost centipede-like appearance if more were added. The triangular head resembled a mantis's, crowned with two bulbous eyes glowing like lanterns. Yet Guan Yu noted curiously that despite its massive head, no mouth was visible—only those enormous eyes.

Six legs extended beneath it, each ending in clawed appendages. The soldier had described eagle-like talons, but up close, Guan Yu saw they more closely resembled chicken feet. Two long antennae rose from its head, their needle-sharp tips glinting coldly under moonlight—clear weapons of attack.

Beyond its hulking obsidian form, nothing else struck Guan Yu as particularly remarkable—until the creature reared its front segments, claws slashing the air in a menacing display. Only then did he spot the gaping maw on its underbelly, previously hidden.

The beast lunged with shocking speed, closing the distance in moments. A claw swept toward them, slicing through the space they’d just vacated as Guan Yu yanked Wang Xiaorong backward. Tents behind them shredded like paper under those razor-edged talons.

“Its claws are its main weapons—both blade and shield,” Guan Yu muttered, drawing his Soulfall Blade. Jiang Yuankai unsheathed a broadsword, its craftsmanship gleaming. Wang Xiaorong, though pale, summoned defensive spells from her Butterfly Pouch, encasing the fighters in protective barriers.

Metal clashed as Jiang’s sword struck the creature’s claw, sparks flying. The rebound numbed his arms. Guan Yu’s follow-up strike met identical resistance—the claws rang like forged steel. Enraged, the monster roared, pivoting to swipe at Jiang Yuankai with whiplash speed.

“Its size belies its agility!” Guan Yu hissed, darting around the beast while unleashing energy blades. Each strike sparked harmlessly against the armored claws. Jiang Yuankai channeled golden light into his blade, leaping behind the creature to carve a bloody gash across its back.

The wounded monster recoiled, eyes darting warily. Seizing the moment, Guan Yu flooded his blade with energy, aiming for the belly-maw. Wang Xiaorong’s thundercloud spell erupted ahead, lightning bolts hammering the beast as it tried fleeing.

Black protective smoke enveloped the creature, weakening under each thunder strike. Yet its wound already healed visibly—flesh knitting at unnatural speed. “We need lethal force, fast!” Guan Yu barked.

As the monster charged him, Guan Yu stood firm, bracing Soulfall Blade horizontally. The impact slid him meters back, but he retaliated with a searing energy beam. Distracted, the beast didn’t notice Wang Xiaorong’s crossbow bolt until it pierced its maw.

Howling, the creature bolted for the void-like portal. Guan Yu activated barrier runes, blue light sealing the entrance. The monster rebounded off the shield, vulnerable as Jiang’s sword bit deep again.

From afar, Guan Yu summoned a vortex—a spinning arrow of pure force that slammed the beast down. Though no external wound showed, its labored breaths betrayed internal damage.

“Don’t let it escape!” Guan Yu shouted. But the wounded creature, desperation fueling it, scrabbled past their assaults and vanished into the void. The barrier held—yet the hunters knew this retreat spelled future peril.
