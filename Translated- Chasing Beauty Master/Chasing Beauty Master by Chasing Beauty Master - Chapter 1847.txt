Tang Muchen's heart blossomed with joy. Though he didn't know what matter Duan Ruxue (Snow-like Duan) sought him for, his mind immediately leapt to romantic possibilities between man and woman. Moreover, Duan Ruxue had personally invited him upstairs—an honor never bestowed upon any young master in the entire capital.

At this moment, Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi were completely forgotten. Duan Ruxue's influence over him eclipsed all else. Having visited the Duan residence multiple times without glimpsing her, encountering her here today felt like divine favor.

"Handsome, are you just leaving like that?" Qiqi called from behind. "Didn't you promise to treat us earlier?"

"This young master is in a good mood today. All your expenses today are on me. Enjoy yourselves to the fullest, hahaha!" Tang Muchen strode toward the second floor without turning back.

Guanyu smiled wryly. "This Tang Muchen... Meeting beauties truly is his fatal flaw. He'd forget his own father in such moments."

Miss Jiang, who happened to approach, overheard and chuckled. "Don't you know? He's been pining after Duan Ruxue for ages. Though her sudden appearance here today is rather peculiar."

Guanyu, unfamiliar with capital affairs, inquired curiously: "Since you and Miss Duan are hailed as the Twin Jewels of the Capital, I must say you're evenly matched. But why is her presence at Wanyang Restaurant remarkable? Isn't this establishment meant for the wealthy?"

**Chapter 4854: The Rules Here**

Miss Jiang twirled, pointing to a pink floral embroidery on her right sleeve. "See this? Crafted by the Duan family."

Nodding comprehension, Guanyu remarked, "I'd like to consult Miss Duan someday. I'm astonished my homeland's customs have reached these parts."

"What strange land do you hail from? It sounds exceedingly distant."

"Not merely distant—immeasurably so." Guanyu sighed. "Returning proves difficult. Compared to your world, my home teems with vitality and marvels unseen here. This martial realm resembles my people's history from millennia past."

He immediately regretted the disclosure. Though none here could comprehend his origins, caution prevailed. Perhaps Duan Ruxue's gown had stirred nostalgia for distant Qiaoyuan District.

"Let's join Chufan for refreshments. Remember, today's my treat—order whatever pleases you, Lady Jiang."

"Why bother when Tang Muchen's paying?" She laughed, carrying a pastry plate toward Chufan.

Guanyu followed, content to converse while letting Qiqi and Wang Xiaorong amuse themselves—unlikely to face trouble here.

Chufan initiated: "I heard personal attendants are forbidden here. Why does that maiden have two maids?"

Equally puzzled, Guanyu sipped aged Nü'erhong wine while awaiting Miss Jiang's explanation.

Seating herself beside Chufan, she mused: "The rules indeed prohibit it. Yet the Duan family wields exceptional influence. Rumors claim deep connections with Wanyang Restaurant—unverified, but likely founded in truth."

"So that was Duan Ruxue? Having dwelled here long, this marks my first sighting. Your reasoning holds—the Duan clan's status rivals the Qins among the Four Great Families, yet differs fundamentally."

"How so?" Guanyu pressed. "Aren't they all merchant elites?"

"You misunderstand, Brother Wanhong," Chufan countered. "Having resided here a year, I've gleaned more. The capital's tranquility masks undercurrents—especially since Prince Zou joined the Crown Prince's faction, accelerating political shifts."

"Consider the Four Families: The Duans rose through sheer merit, unlike others. The Qins have imperial kinship through the Second Prince's consort. The Caos married daughters to officials for influence. The Tangs leverage the Emperor's childhood companionship with Patriarch Tang. Only the Duans built their empire through genuine prowess—a foundation unshakable."

Guanyu nodded, noting Chufan's hushed tones. Discussing powerful clans required discretion—careless words risked grave offense.

"The Duans' self-made success commands true respect," Guanyu agreed. "Brother Chufan, your grasp of capital intrigues—even regarding Prince Zou—surprises me for a year's residence."

Chufan glanced at Miss Jiang. "Credit our formidable Commandery Princess here. Without her insights, how could I know such details?"

Guanyu chuckled. "True enough. Lady Jiang herself remains the capital's most extraordinary figure—beloved by the Emperor, daughter of a renowned martial hero and the Grand Princess. If not for Chufan, her spirited nature might have suited me well."

"You flatter me, Wanhong. I'll gladly accept such praise." Miss Jiang's smile radiated warmth.

Guanyu admired her gracious sociability—this noblewoman's unpretentious charm bridged all social divides. The capital well knew her romance with Chufan, their steadfast devotion inspiring admiration.

"Still, Duan Ruxue's appearance perplexes me," Miss Jiang mused. "Summoning Tang Muchen especially—most uncharacteristic."

**Chapter 4855: The Puzzle**

"Expected amidst growing tensions," Chufan reasoned. "The Caos recently suffered multiple business disasters—cloth shops burned, establishments wrecked within hours. Such events demand clan discussions."

Miss Jiang frowned. "Chufan! Rumors claim accidents befell Cao gambling dens and taverns. The cloth shop fire had no witnesses—how deem it deliberate?"

"Accidents?" Chufan snorted, glancing subtly at Guanyu. "Mere Cao propaganda. Three simultaneous 'misfortunes'? Only fools swallow that tale."

"Stinky Chufan! Calling me brainless?" She lunged for his ear.

Dodging, he begged mercy: "A slip of tongue, milady! Never implying..."

Having endured her pinches before, Chufan knew better than to resist.

"Hmph! Sparing you only for your injured leg's sake," she relented, their playful dynamic resurfacing.

"Perhaps divine retribution for Cao misdeeds," Guanyu suggested casually.

Miss Jiang nodded. "Exactly! Their gambling dens I believe targeted, but the deserted cloth shop? Heavenly punishment!"

"True masters leave no traces," Chufan countered. "The Caos' sudden ruin suggests formidable enemies—not common ruffians."

"Still, who bears such hatred?" Miss Jiang pondered.

"Why ponder?" Guanyu shrugged. "Cao affairs don't concern us. Their downfall would make fine theater."

Though suspecting Guanyu's involvement, Chufan kept silent. The Cao's recent sabotage of Hongyan Theater made retaliation predictable. Without evidence, accusations proved futile—yet understanding hung unspoken between them.

"The Caos won't take this lightly," Miss Jiang warned. "Near the Emperor's seat, repercussions will follow."

Guanyu remained indifferent. The Cao clan's wrath concerned him little—no evidence linked him to their ruin. Let them chase shadows.

Meanwhile, Tang Muchen bounded upstairs to a private chamber guarded by Duan Ruxue's maids.

"Young Master Tang, please enter. The mistress awaits."

The lavish room's sandalwood fragrance quickened his pulse. There she sat—an ethereal vision surpassing mortal beauty, her porcelain features radiating otherworldly grace.

Tang Muchen's throat dried, words evaporating as he gaped.

"Why stand there dazed? Sit—we've matters to discuss." Her calm tone held faint irritation at his stare, though accustomed to such gazes.

"Y-yes... Thank you, Lady Duan..." He gulped, approaching as if treading clouds. Wild fantasies surged—could this be the longed-for romantic liaison? The prospect thrilled him beyond measure.

**Chapter 4856: Illusions of Security**

Silence amplified his hammering heart. Seated at last, Duan Ruxue began coolly: "You presume greatly, Young Master Tang. My summons ignored until I descended personally?"

"A thousand pardons, Lady Duan!" He waved frantic hands. "Had I known it was you! That incompetent servant failed to clarify—I'd never slight your invitation!"

No sacrifice seemed too great to appease this goddess who'd captivated him for years. Previously pursuing Miss Jiang for political advantage, her family's rejection had redirected his obsession here.

The chamber's opulence spoke volumes—hourly rates here beggared most nobles. Yet Tang Muchen registered only her rosepetal lips and jade complexion.

"Enough." Her voice crystallized the air. "I require your... assistance."

His breath hitched. Assistance? What service could warrant this audience? The possibilities dizzying, Tang Muchen leaned forward—every fiber anticipating paradise.
