“Your Majesty, Eldest Princess,” Prince Zou Wangye (Prince of Zou) said, “My men discovered traces outside the city walls that may indicate where Princess Jiang Xin (Heart of Jiang) is being held. However, we dare not act recklessly yet. A single misstep could endanger her life.”

“If there’s a lead, why hesitate? We must storm the place immediately!” the Emperor exclaimed urgently.

“Please calm Your Majesty’s wrath,” Prince Zou soothed. “These are merely preliminary traces – we cannot confirm the kidnappers’ presence there. Without full intelligence, hasty action might provoke them to harm the Princess. Regret would follow too late.”

“Indeed, Imperial Uncle speaks wisely. This clue itself is progress,” the Eldest Princess interjected. “Where was this found?”

“At a ruined temple mountain ten li beyond the northern gates.”

“That desolate place?” The Princess frowned. “It’s been abandoned for years since that mysterious death at the temple. Changed roads left it isolated.”

The Emperor nodded. “I recall its former prosperity as pilgrimage site. The roads shifted, visitors dwindled...” All night, messengers brought fruitless updates, fraying the Princess’ nerves until Prince Zou’s report revived hope with fresh anxiety.

“Imperial Uncle,” the Princess questioned, “Captain Yu Kong’s elite troops searched there earlier and found nothing. Is your information reliable?”

“My sources are certain,” Prince Zou asserted. “I’ve toiled all night verifying clues. I’m ninety percent sure Princess Jiang Xin is held there. The elites’ noisy search alerted the kidnappers, so I sent discreet agents. Their meticulous efforts bore fruit – though we’ve not struck yet due to... complicating factors.”

Exchanging glances, the Emperor urged, “Speak plainly. What complications?”

Prince Zou sighed. “The kidnappers collaborate with城内 (city) allies. I believe local conspirators hired outsiders to abduct the Princess during the transfer between palace and驸马府 (Imperial Son-in-Law’s Residence). By the time troops searched the city, she’d already been smuggled out. These城外 (outskirts) bandits await城内 orders to demand the East Sea Dragon Pearl from驸马爷 (Imperial Son-in-Law), believing it’s in his possession rather than Your Majesty’s.”

“Outrageous!” The Emperor’s face darkened. “Name this traitor!”

“Though suspicions exist, evidence is lacking. Hence my men delay rescuing – we aim to capture both城外 kidnappers and城内 conspirators when they meet. I predict their rendezvous today.”

“Then what’s our course?” the Emperor pressed. “We must save Xin’er!”

“Patience,” Prince Zou advised. “My son Wu Hui (Unrepentant) has been surveilling the temple since last night. At dawn, Guan Yu and the Crown Prince joined them. They’re positioned to strike when the conspirators arrive.”

Hidden beneath autumn foliage outside the temple walls, Guan Yu fought boredom. The Crown Prince snored beside him, exhausted from yesterday’s efforts. A distant clop of hooves stirred Guan Yu – someone ascended the mountain path.

Through trees, he recognized the cloaked figure: Cao Di (Succession), nose still bandaged from their last encounter. The young master dismounted at the temple’s blackened gate, muttering “My dear little Princess, here I come” before scaling the wall.

Guan Yu signaled Zou Wu Hui’s team. As Cao Di entered the main hall and tapped a rhythmic code (three-two-three knocks) on the stone altar, Guan Yu replicated the pattern after Cao disappeared through the revealed passage.

When the hidden door reopened, Guan Yu seized the guard’s throat. “Patriarch Cao sent me,” he hissed before snapping the man’s neck. The party descended torchlit tunnels into the mountain’s heart.

In a cramped cell, Princess Jiang Xin trembled as a green snake slithered toward her bound form. When Cao Di appeared, hope flashed – until his lecherous grin chilled her blood.

“What a pretty sweat,” Cao sneered, ripping the gag from her mouth. His fingers traced her jaw. “Let me cool you down.”

“Touch me and your clan perishes!” Jiang Xin spat.

Laughing, Cao dangled the snake near her face. “Scared? How delightful!” Her screams crescendoed until fainting. As Cao tore her collar, Guan Yu’s fist smashed his skull like a warhammer.
