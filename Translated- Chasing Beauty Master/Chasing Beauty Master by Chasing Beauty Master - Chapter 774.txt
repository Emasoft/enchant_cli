“Come, come, Guan Yu, let me introduce you. This is my younger sister, Bai Jiao (White Charm).” Turning back, he added, “Jiao’er, this is the Guan Yu I’ve often mentioned—now the most celebrated figure in Kaihuang Academy, a true hero.”

Bai Jiao rose gracefully, her stiletto heels accentuating her svelte, alluring figure. In a honeyed voice dripping with charm, she purred, “I’ve long heard of Kaihuang’s extraordinary rising star who exposed the principal’s scandals. I’ve been eagerly awaiting this meeting. Delighted to finally make your acquaintance.”

Her lilting, coquettish tone stirred an intoxicating excitement as she extended a jade-like hand. Guan Yu grasped it—soft as silk, bonelessly smooth. Her entire being exuded an irresistible allure, every inch radiating seduction. Were Guan Yu not accustomed to gatherings of beauties, he might have lost composure then and there.

**Chapter 1963: The Final Hour**

“I’ve long heard of Kaihuang’s extraordinary rising star who exposed the principal’s scandals,” she repeated, her voice a velvet caress. “Delighted to finally make your acquaintance.”

The cadence of her speech enchanted as she pressed closer, her perfume enveloping him. Guan Yu managed a polite smile. “The pleasure is mine,” he replied, gesturing for her to sit.

After exchanging pleasantries, Guan Yu cut to the chase: “Sun Xu, have you considered my demand to disband the Gentlemen’s Society?”

“Must there be no room for negotiation?” Sun Xu implored.

“I’m granting you your final grace period,” Guan Yu stated coldly.

The temperature plummeted as Sun Xu and his cronies stiffened. Sun Zhi sneered, “Since when do you monopolize power? Each faction minds its own affairs—yet you demand others dissolve while building your own empire? Aspiring to rule the entire academy?”

Guan Yu’s laugh held no mirth. “First, I’ve no such ambition—though dominating this school would be trivial. Second, this isn’t about territories. Sun Xu provoked me by assaulting my subordinate—an insult demanding recompense.”

Li Yuan bristled. “Sun already apologized! Must you hound him to death?”

Bai Jiao tittered, “Observe these men squabbling over trifles! Guan Yu’s integrity shines unlike your scheming lot. Li Yuan—must you ogle my chest so brazenly? Shameless!”

Caught red-handed, Li Yuan scratched his head sheepishly. Bai Jiao then declared, “I wish to speak with Guan Yu privately. Leave us.”

After exchanging loaded glances, Sun Xu ushered his companions out. Guan Yu protested, but the door shut firmly behind them.

“Brother Guan Yu…” Her whisper sent shivers down his spine. He instinctively recoiled as she pouted, “Why retreat? I don’t bite.” Her voice liquefied resolve, the intimate setting amplifying discomfort.

“No need for nerves,” she murmured, edging her chair closer. “We’ve ample time…” Her natural sensuality transcended artifice. When she arched her back suggestively, Guan Yu’s gaze betrayed involuntary fascination.

This Bai Jiao—no ordinary girl, likely not a Kaihuang student—reveled in his attention. Rising sinuously, she draped herself across his lap. “Am I not beautiful, Brother Guan Yu?”

Her body undulated like liquid silk, strategic neckline positioned for maximum effect. “Exquisite,” Guan Yu admitted, steadying his breath as her warm exhalation fogged his senses with floral intoxication.

“Then why not spare Sun Xu?” she whispered, hiking her skirt to reveal dangerous curves. “In exchange… I’m yours.”

Guan Yu studied her with feigned rapture before deadpanning, “Lower your skirt before you catch cold.”

Her smile faltered momentarily. “Must you refuse me?” she persisted, straddling him fully. The proximity of perfumed skin tested even his seasoned restraint.

“Yes.” His refusal rang steel-clad.

Fury flashed behind her coquetry. *All this effort wasted!* she seethed internally. Sun Xu’s contingency plan activated—if seduction failed, assassination would follow. Outside, ambushers awaited her signal.

**Chapter 1964: Not So Simple**

As Bai Jiao’s dagger materialized, Guan Yu twisted sideways. The serrated blade sank into his bicep. He flung her off with a kick, but she retaliated mid-air, narrowly missing his abdomen thanks to his energy shield.

The commotion summoned Sun Xu’s crew bursting through the door. “You’ve crossed the wrong man!” Sun Xu brandished a pistol while henchmen swarmed with machetes.

Blood streamed from Guan Yu’s arm as he parried attacks. Outnumbered and injured, he detonated his protective aura in a concussive blast, creating an opening to leap through the third-floor window.

Landing in a roll, he sprinted toward his car. Pursuers followed, but Guan Yu’s combat prowess held them at bay until Sun Xu’s gun muzzle halted his escape.

“Move and I paint the pavement!” Sun Xu gloated through cigarette smoke. Backed against the wall, Guan Yu feinted toward the window—then shattered through it.

Three stories down, he hit the ground running. “AFTER HIM!” Sun Xu bellowed as accomplices gave chase. Guan Yu’s luxury car outran their van through serpentine alleys, but the hunt had only begun.

**Chapter 1965: Pursuit**

Tires screeched as Guan Yu fishtailed around corners, rearview mirror tracking the persistent gold van. One-handed driving complicated his blood-slicked grip, yet the sports car’s horsepower gradually widened the gap. For now, survival—but vengeance would come.
