“Left Envoy, you truly put me in a difficult position,” Wang Xiaorong retorted. “If I can’t bring the Young Master back this time, the Demon Lord will surely hold me accountable. His Lordship explicitly ordered that the Young Master must not be allowed to venture into the desert’s dangers. I have no choice but to escort him back.”

“Young Master,” the Left Envoy said apologetically, “please do not make this harder. The Demon Lord has entrusted me with the Demonic Decree. You understand what this signifies. If you return with me, my mission will be fulfilled. I beg you not to resist.”

Wang Xiaorong’s defiance flared. “Not make it harder for you? So you’d rather make it impossible for me?” Though countless arguments rose within her, they lodged in her throat unspoken. Resistance seemed futile—the Left Envoy wielded the Demonic Decree, granting him authority to forcibly retrieve her if necessary.

Guan Yu interjected, “I fail to comprehend this sudden reversal. The Demon Lord previously permitted Xiaorong to accompany me. We haven’t even reached the desert yet. Does he fear its perils so acutely? Surely he anticipated these risks when granting approval?”

The Left Envoy, mindful of Guan Yu’s status as Wang Xiaorong’s beloved, tempered his response. “Consider your recent actions. Why have you entangled yourselves with imperial officials? Rumors now circulate linking you to Magistrate Zhou’s poisoning—a grave concern for His Lordship. Young Master, you know our jianghu principles: no interaction with government lackeys. The Demonic Soul Sect has maintained clear boundaries with them for decades. Why provoke conflict now? Those bureaucrats employ ruthless methods. Combined with reports of Old Sun’s disappearance in quicksand, the Demon Lord insists on your immediate return.”

“Magistrate Zhou was killed by prolonged poisoning—how does that involve us?” Wang Xiaorong countered. “We only met him twice! Guan Yu already explained the poison required sustained administration. What possible motive would we have?”

“Reason matters little when accusations solidify,” the Left Envoy sighed. “The authorities have already branded you culprits. Do you imagine they’ll entertain your defenses? They’ll simply fasten the crime upon convenient targets.”

Chapter 3723: Waiting to Depart Together

“Even if the world knows your innocence, what then?” the envoy continued. “The bureaucracy thrives on chaos. They care only for presenting scapegoats to the executioner’s block. Once ensnared in their machinations, escape becomes impossible. The accusation stands—you two allegedly poisoned the magistrate. Where’s your counterproof? Even with evidence, legal entanglements would consume you. Clearly, you’ve offended powerful enemies. This matter reached the Demon Lord’s ears, hence my presence.”

Wang Xiaorong recalled the unreasonable carriage merchant’s wife. “That fat shrew must have spread these lies after our quarrel! But how did Father learn of this from the sect’s distant stronghold?”

“The Demon Lord’s intelligence network defies mortal comprehension,” the Left Envoy stated gravely. “The situation demands your return. Plead your case before him—perhaps he’ll grant you renewed freedom. My hands are tied otherwise.”

Guan Yu, pondering recent events, conceded the envoy’s point. Their journey had inexplicably intersected multiple government-related incidents—two murders, now this poisoning. This ominous pattern couldn’t be ignored.

“Father bullies me so!” Wang Xiaorong pouted, eyes glistening. “Wielding the Demonic Decree to intimidate—I detest him!” Though rebellion simmered within her, the decree’s authority bound her compliance. Her pleading gaze sought Guan Yu.

Understanding sect politics, Guan Yu advised gently, “Perhaps you should return temporarily. The Demon Lord may simply have instructions. Rejoin me after a few days—we’ll continue together.”

“Truly?” Hope softened Wang Xiaorong’s frustration. “You’ll wait here? I’ll find a way back swiftly—I swear!”

“Without doubt,” Guan Yu affirmed. “I’ll remain until your return. Should the Demon Lord forbid your desert journey, send word. We’ll devise alternatives.”

“Agreed then,” she sighed, resentment lingering. “How I loathe Father’s methods!”

Their farewells halted as a familiar figure approached. Guan Yu rose in surprise. “Xiao Zhi? What brings you here?”

“Guan Yu!” The newcomer beamed. “Rumors placed you in Booktown—finding you so quickly proves fortunate!” His smile faded upon noticing the Left Envoy. “Why consort with these two? Where’s Senior Brother Yanzao?”

“Circumstances compelled this meeting,” Guan Yu explained hastily. “The Demon Lord recalls Xiaorong. We were negotiating her departure.” Relief tinged his voice—had other sect members witnessed this, disastrous rumors might spread.

Xiao Zhi eyed the Left Envoy warily. Knowing the envoy’s status as the Demon Lord’s right hand, he cautioned, “Fraternizing with demonic cultivators risks severe punishment if discovered. The sect won’t tolerate—”

“Our connection is purely personal,” Guan Yu interrupted. “Xiaorong’s safety concerns prompted this. You know our history.”

Seeking to defuse tension, Wang Xiaorong bid farewell. “I’ll send word soon. Take care, Guan Yu.” Her lingering gaze conveyed volumes before she departed with the envoy.

Chapter 3724: Fresh Tidings

Alone with Xiao Zhi, Guan Yu questioned, “Does Elder Zheng know you’re here? This desert venture grows perilous.”

“The Sect Master himself dispatched me,” Xiao Zhi revealed. “News reached us—a Demonic Soul Sect fox-spirit perished in quicksand, plus your conflicts with officials. Elder Lu and Father grew concerned. I volunteered to assist.”

Guan Yu marveled at the sect’s intelligence network—though slower than the demonic faction’s, their awareness of Old Sun’s fate proved impressive. “Our official troubles are exaggerated—minor clashes blown out of proportion.”

Xiao Zhi frowned. “Government snakes strike from shadows. Stay vigilant.” Changing subjects, he asked, “Where’s Yanzao? Does he know about you and the demon girl?”

“He remains unaware,” Guan Yu admitted. “Keep this secret. Yanzao’s clever but... traditional.”

“Your secret’s safe,” Xiao Zhi pledged. “I know your character.”

Meanwhile, Yanzao’s frustrations mounted at a local inn. After futile haggling over silver, he abandoned the dispute. Funds dwindling, he sought diversion—tonight’s pleasures might offset tomorrow’s desert hardships.

Twilight revealed painted women beckoning from brothel doors. Discerning better establishments, Yanzao entered the “Blossom Pavilion,” instantly surrounded by perfumed courtesans. A sneezing fit overcame him.

“Poor dear,” a powdered matron mocked. “If our charms overwhelm you, perhaps visit a physician instead?”

Yanzao straightened, feigning composure. “Merely adjusting to your... enthusiasm. Shall we test my endurance?”

Their banter ceased when a figure beckoned from the stairs—the Left Envoy. Dread coiled in Yanzao’s gut. The lunar cycle neared—without the envoy’s antidote, his blood curse would transform him into a hair-covered monstrosity, burning life-force until death.

Chapter 3725: Curb Your Ambitions

Escaping the courtesans’ clutches, Yanzao followed to a private chamber. The envoy tossed him a pill. “Consume this. The Demon Lord commands—prevent Guan Yu from obtaining the second volume of the Eight-Sided Drum Technique. Harm him not.”

“Spare that dual-cultivating menace?” Yanzao protested. “He’s Yunqing’s rising star—a future scourge!”

“The Demon Lord’s orders stand,” the envoy coldly reiterated. “Perhaps Guan Yu may yet join our ranks. Execute this command, or face the blood curse’s full wrath.”

Shock gripped Yanzao—Guan Yu already possessed the first technique! “Yunqing must hear of this treachery! He’ll be disgraced!”

“Reveal this,” the envoy warned, “and you’ll perish before seeing trial. The Demon Lord desires Guan Yu’s recruitment, not elimination. Thwart his desert quest through subterfuge, not force.”

Yanzao seethed silently. This upstart had stolen his sect standing, now enjoyed demonic protection? Forced obedience chafed, but the antidote’s relief decided matters. “As His Lordship commands.”

“Remember,” the envoy concluded, “should Guan Yu acquire the second technique, neither desert sands nor sect walls will shield you from consequence.”
