Guan Yu knew that after his appearance in City Y, the military couldn't immediately confirm his capabilities. They first sent Zheng Rongguang to assess him. After subduing Yu Zhengchun (Righteous Spring) and Meng Feilong (Soaring Dragon) in the eastern suburbs, he'd instructed them to relay a message requesting extended leniency for the Ouyang family. These past days, the military had undoubtedly been investigating him thoroughly – hence Commander He's presence at today's banquet.

Guan Yu returned Commander He's smile with resolute conviction. "Long travels intensify homesickness and longing for family. Having weathered countless storms abroad, I've realized that no matter how far one roams, the heart's true compass always points home. A man's shoulders should bear duty and responsibility – to protect his homeland and kin. My return aims to purge this land of vipers and opportunists. For this noble cause, I'll require your support, Commander."

Guan Yu's power now posed a national security concern. Commander He's presence signaled the military's cautious probe into his intentions. Any entity capable of effortlessly defeating two Class One Mutants rendered conventional forces obsolete. While nuclear weapons might theoretically eliminate such a threat, the catastrophic collateral damage made this option untenable.

Chapter 1702: The War God Ito

Fifty kilometers away, Guan Yu's face filled a surveillance screen fed by grain-sized cameras undoubtedly planted on Commander He. Eight hundred.

As Guan Yu spoke, uniformed officers in the monitoring room nodded approvingly. Any observer would recognize these figures frequenting national broadcasts. Three plainclothes elders beside them – household names across China – studied the feed intently. This high-powered assembly sought to gauge Guan Yu's post-return stance through his banquet conversation.

Since reemerging into reality, Guan Yu hadn't reported to his former Dragon Group superiors. The covert agency split into factions: one advocating forced recall, another preferring cautious engagement to discern his motives.

Though Guan Yu hadn't lingered after exiting the Divine Realm, surveillance captured his aerial departure – footage restricted to top echelons, unknown even to deputy military commanders.

Initial analysis suggested terrifying capabilities: thirty-kilometer per second mobility (hundreds-fold faster than any vehicle) and strike potency rivaling nuclear warheads. A single full-powered attack in a metropolitan center could unleash unimaginable devastation.

Despite Guan Yu's proven patriotism during his pre-Divine Realm service two decades prior, China – like other nations scarred by mutant upheavals – maintained wary observation. Tonight's carefully orchestrated banquet with Du Xiaojuan served dual purposes: asserting goodwill while demonstrating unassailable strength.

The Ouyang family's weapons development for East Island constituted unambiguous treason. No individual or department dared defend collaborating with that ambitious nation's world-shifting armament projects. By merging the Ouyang conglomerate with his Universal Group, Guan Yu simultaneously rescued the family and signaled his capacity to counterbalance East Island.

Through his dialogue with Deputy Commander He Wu, Guan Yu reassured hidden watchers: unlike destructive mutants, he'd safeguard national stability and confront expansionist threats like East Island.

The central elder among three plainclothes statesmen nodded gravely. "Well said. Guan Yu hasn't forgotten his roots. His return couldn't be timelier. Intelligence confirms East Island's 'War God Ito' and suspected American returnees from the Divine Realm. We must pray Guan Yu surpasses them all."

A general inquired, "Should we brief Guan Yu on Ito and the American situation?"

"Necessary," the elder affirmed. "When he confronts East Island, forewarning prevents disastrous ambushes. We must fully commit – establish Dragon Group's new Guan Yu-led division to purge malignant mutants. Tolerance has bred vipers in our midst."

The assembly brightened at this decisive shift. Years of tolerating powerful but vicious mutants to avoid social chaos had festered into crisis. Guan Yu's ability to subdue Class One Mutants promised long-awaited resolution.

Historically, China monitored emerging factions until threats demanded eradication. Wise organizations eventually legitimized through lawful enterprise. Now, Universal Group's merger exemplified this transition.

Receiving his cue, Commander He raised a toast. "I salute your integrity, Guan Yu. Lesser men would grow tyrannical with such power. Our leaders wish you informed: East Island's 'War God Ito' and an unidentified American have returned. No other nations report returnees yet."

Guan Yu's smile turned glacial. "Ito... Excellent. I'd planned sightseeing at East Island's Corpse Mountain. Now I'll test this 'War God's' mettle."

Chapter 1703: Tempest Society Dossier

Guan Yu's worst fears materialized – others had breached the barrier between Abyssal Realm and reality. If denizens of that dark dimension invaded... The implications froze his blood.

Suppressing this dread, Guan Yu toasted Ouyang Zhengdong. The family patriarch, aware of his daughter's relationship with Guan Yu, approached with deferential humility – their clan's fate now inextricably tied to this demigod.

As Commander He and Ouyang exchanged pleasantries, unspoken understandings replaced former ultimatums. No documents recorded these pivotal agreements – merely gentlemen's accords between Earth's mightiest warrior and its most powerful nation.

Before departing, Commander He produced a thumb drive. "Dragon Group's current leader Ning Zhan sends this."

Post-banquet, Guan Yu reviewed the encrypted files – comprehensive intelligence on the Tempest Society. Topping the list: Hong Wudi (Invincible Hong), China's missing Class One Mutant, shockingly not the organization's leader. That distinction belonged to an enigma – genderless, ageless, perpetually shrouded in black.

Dossier estimates: 1 Class One, 3 Class Two, 10 Class Three, and 86 pseudo-mutants – combat potential rivaling small nations. Most alarmingly, these numbers excluded the mysterious leader, likely surpassing Hong's might.

Headquartered in southwest China's 6,100-meter Mount Wutu'er – a former abandoned weapons testing ground – the Tempest Society's remote base facilitated covert pseudo-mutant production. Their true strength remained unknown even to Dragon Group.

Du Xiaojuan gasped over Guan Yu's shoulder. "No wonder Commander He came personally. Without you, how could we oppose this hydra?"

Guan Yu pondered: "Though I could assault their stronghold, scattered survivors might wreak havoc. This requires coordinated strikes, not solo heroics."

Chapter 1704: Calm Before Storm

Currently, Guan Yu commanded three mutants – Class One duo Yu Zhengchun and Meng Feilong, plus Class Three Mu Yun. Previously formidable, this force now seemed inadequate against Tempest Society's revealed might.

Next morning, Xue Yingfeng called – Dragon Group postponed their Tempest operation upon learning of Ito. Though inviting Guan Yu to lead a new anti-mutant division, he declined, citing Universal Group commitments.

An uneasy quiet descended. Rumors spread of returnees beyond Ito – Americans, Russians, others. Nations traded veiled probes, truth obscured in shadowplay.

Guan Yu reunited with old comrades through Dong Bin. Despite two decades and familial obligations, brothers-in-arms yearned to ride again. Moved, Guan Yu planned gradual corporate mergers to reunite them, secretly contemplating empowering his loyalists beyond pseudo-mutant capabilities – an untested concept requiring trial.

As geopolitical tensions simmered beneath false calm, Guan Yu understood: this lull merely presaged the coming storm.
