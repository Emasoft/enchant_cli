The lobby manager had shouted, but no one dared move. Everyone trembled as they stared at Guan Yu, knowing full well this ten thousand yuan wasn't easily earned. Before they could approach, they'd be slaughtered.

Guan Yu glared at the manager by the entrance. Releasing his internal energy, he vanished instantly—a move he'd used before. The panicked manager spun around to flee.

But how could his speed match Guan Yu's? In the blink of an eye, Guan Yu crossed nearly ten meters. The next moment, he materialized before the balding manager, whose sparse hair gleamed with excessive gel.

With a roar, Guan Yu smashed his fist downward. A bloodcurdling scream erupted as the manager's stout frame flew backward, crashing into the private room's doorframe. Guan Yu grabbed his remaining hair and yanked—a clump tore free, making the manager wail for mercy.

Choking the man's throat, Guan Yu snarled, "Order someone to fetch clean water immediately!"

"Y-yes! Quick, go fetch a basin of clean water, you useless dogs! Are you waiting here to watch me die?" the manager screeched.

Several subordinates scrambled out, returning moments later with water. Guan Yu carried the basin to Xue Jing. "Rinse your eyes." After washing, her pain subsided and vision gradually cleared.

Guan Yu turned his fury back to the manager. "You'll die today. Choose your method."

The manager, ribs likely shattered from Guan Yu's punch, wheezed through unbearable chest pain. Death seemed imminent even without further blows.

Wei Hongwei trembled inwardly. He knew Mike's establishment housed extraordinary talents—rumored members of the Beishan Gang, infamous in City A. Though unclear on their origins, he understood their terrifying rise: from street thugs a decade ago to absorbing mutants and psychics, rapidly amassing wealth and power.

The Beishan Gang now resembled a voracious serpent, swallowing dozens of companies through immense resources. With over ten psychics among their ranks—precious assets in a nation with fewer than a hundred ESPers—none dared challenge them.

Wei knew they'd crossed the gang today. Though terrified, his loyalty held. Guan Yu had protected them while risking himself—such brotherhood deserved shared fate. Yet despair gnawed at him; as his family's sole heir, extinction loomed if he perished.

Jia Bo nearly wet himself in fear. This celebratory night at Mike's had turned lethal—a tragedy surpassing Dou E's unjust fate!

Wang Xiaoqian remained impassive, her thoughts inscrutable. Guan Yu noted their fear but focused on ensuring safe passage.

Wei approached, voice shaking. "Brother Guan, is Sister-in-law's vision...?"

Guan Yu nodded approvingly. "She's fine. Trust me—we'll leave safely."

"Always have, Brother!" Wei declared.

Relieved after Xue Jing's recovery, Guan Yu resolved to eliminate the manager. Time pressed—they needed medical checks.

He flicked a bloodied machete with his foot. It shot toward the manager like an arrow. Resigned, the man closed his eyes...

*Clang!* A metallic screech diverted the blade, sparking against the wall.

A gaunt, towering figure entered—over six feet tall yet skeletal, face obscured by lank hair. Xue Jing identified him instantly: "A Second-class Pseudo-ESP. Who knew Mike's hid such power?"

The newcomer addressed the manager: "Leave. Get medical care."

The manager, expecting death, blinked in disbelief. "Th-thank you, Second-in-Command..."

As underlings carried him out, Guan Yu stayed wary. This opponent radiated danger.

Wei's hopes crumbled—even Third-class Pseudo-ESPs could defeat a dozen men. A Second-class meant instant death.

The gaunt man swept hair from his face, revealing astonishment upon seeing Guan Yu. "Guan Yu? You don't remember me?" His Japanese-accented Chinese drew notice.

Guan Yu frowned. "I lost memories. Do we know each other?"

Xue Jing stepped forward. "He truly doesn't recall. Explain your connection."

The Second-in-Command nodded. "Months ago in Japan, I witnessed your battle against our War God. You fought evenly while protecting a woman—holding back, I believe. I abandoned science to seek your realm in China, but heard you'd vanished after北极's mission..."

Wei gaped—his idol was legendary! Guan Yu, amnesiac savior, once a god-like界尊!

Xue Jing requested privacy. The Second-in-Command dismissed subordinates, leading them to his office.

After others left, Xue Jing revealed Guan Yu's北极 ordeal: ambushed by魔族 in ice caves, amnesia shielding him from past burdens.

The Japanese man paled. "魔族 breaching契约? If true, chaos looms. Why was Guan Yu there?"

"To awaken polar forces," Xue Jing admitted. "Perhaps manipulated by the Drifter—a being using him against魔族. His memory loss... maybe subconscious rejection of being a pawn."

Outside, Guan Yu overheard fragments. His past self could swat foes like flies? Current struggles against thugs felt pathetic. Yet intrigue burned—what grander destiny awaited?

**Chapter 1,797: Your Doom**

The crowd relaxed upon the Second-in-Command's arrival—surely Guan Yu's end. Yet shockingly, he froze upon facing Guan Yu.

Two minutes passed before he rasped, "Guan Yu?"

All eyes turned. Murmurs spread: connections? History?

Guan Yu shrugged at Xue Jing and Wei—no recognition.

The Japanese pressed: "How could you lose memories? What force could cripple you?"

Xue Jing intervened: "Let's discuss privately."

**Chapter 1,798: Awakening Potential**

After dismissing others, Xue Jing recounted the ice cave's truths—the Drifter,魔族's attack, Guan Yu's sacrifice. The Second-in-Command marveled at higher cosmic conflicts.

"Races coexist under ancient compacts," he muttered. "魔族 invading breaks all accords. Yet Guan Yu confronted this..."

Xue Jing nodded. "We protect his ignorance. Perhaps destiny reshapes him."

Unseen, Guan Yu pondered revelations. Once a deity among men? The thought thrilled and terrified—what dormant power lay within?
