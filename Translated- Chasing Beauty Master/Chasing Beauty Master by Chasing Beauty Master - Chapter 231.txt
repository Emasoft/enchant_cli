“I was worried Guan Yu might not pass and secretly anxious, but who’d have thought he not only finished the entire exam paper but kept passing notes nonstop?

Even more absurd, notes flew everywhere, yet Liu Gang acted blind to it all. Is this really the academic director? Is this even an exam anymore?

Liu Shilei’s mind spun with confusion.

Still, things seemed to be moving in a favorable direction, and the weight in her heart finally eased.

As for cheating? Who cared.

**Chapter 576: Tip-off**

Love is a thing—a wondrous thing.

Love is a phenomenon—a magical phenomenon.

Anyone, at any time, upon encountering it, becomes utterly ensnared.

This is why people throw caution to the wind for love, sacrificing everything.

Unbeknownst to herself, Liu Shilei had already plunged into love’s river, though she hadn’t yet realized it.

For Guan Yu’s sake, so he could remain at school, what did cheating matter? Moments ago, she’d racked her brains to help him through this ordeal. Now, it seemed unnecessary.

She exhaled deeply, rolled her stiff neck, and suddenly noticed the surveillance cameras in the classroom corners. Her relief vanished, replaced by panic.

Without hesitation, she hurried to Guan Yu’s desk, gently poked his arm, and whispered, “Guan Yu, keep it low-key. There are cameras above. Don’t let them catch you.”

Guan Yu froze. He’d expected her to scold him for helping others cheat, but instead, she warned him about the cameras. Though her voice trembled with urgency, he sensed deep care—even affection—warming his heart.

He glanced up, grinning confidently. “Don’t worry, sis. It’s fine.”

As Liu Shilei opened her mouth to reply, a low, accusatory voice cut in.

“Professor Liu, Guan Yu’s your younger brother, isn’t he? No wonder you’re so… *concerned*.” Liu Gang’s words, though quiet, carried clearly across the room.

*Concerned?* The insinuation hung thick. To anyone listening, his tone twisted the word into something lurid.

There Liu Shilei stood, whispering intimately with Guan Yu, their proximity blatantly suspicious. By highlighting this, Liu Gang planted seeds of doubt, heedless of her reputation as a teacher. His malice was plain: while Guan Yu might shrug off rumors, Liu Shilei’s career could crumble.

Her face paled; Guan Yu’s darkened stormily. The stakes had shifted—this was no longer just about him.

“Hmph. If anyone’s ‘caring’ for me, Liu Gang, it’s certainly not Professor Liu,” Guan Yu retorted coldly, fury undisguised.

His words struck like a stone rippling water.

Wang Zhen, ever loyal, leapt to his defense. “Deputy Director Liu,” he emphasized the title mockingly, “we appreciate your ‘care’ for our class. As students, we believe in reciprocity—unlike some ingrates who bite the hand that feeds.”

The jab was masterful: “care” thanked Liu Gang for ignoring the cheating earlier while hinting at retaliation for his harassment. The “ingrate” clearly targeted the snitch who’d betrayed them. Wang Zhen’s words skewered two birds with one arrow.

With Wang Zhen leading, loyal underlings erupted in chaos. The quiet exam hall exploded into uproar.

Liu Gang blanched, unprepared for Guan Yu’s influence. Fearing loss of control, he bellowed, “Silence! Want to fail? Anyone disrupting the exam gets expelled!”

Yet the threat fell flat. Without Guan Yu’s signal, the rebellion continued.

Satisfied by the diversion, Guan Yu nodded at Wang Zhen, who stood and declared, “Classmates, focus! Don’t let petty opportunists exploit us.”

Each word stabbed Liu Gang’s pride. When *he* invoked the school’s authority, they’d ignored him. Yet Wang Zhen’s mere gesture restored order. The humiliation burned.

But Liu Gang swallowed his rage. He’d wait—just minutes left.

According to his intel, Guan Yu would distribute the real answers ten minutes before the exam ended. The earlier notes were decoys. If that failed, the true answers would circulate now.

Glancing at his watch—five minutes remaining—Liu Gang envisioned triumph: catching them red-handed, expelling Guan Yu, reclaiming dignity.

Guan Yu had tossed out thirty-odd “answers.” With over twenty students still empty-handed, he began lobbing notes like artillery shells. One even sailed past Liu Gang’s nose to a distant desk. The recipient glanced nervously, but Liu Gang feigned blindness.

*Is he an idiot?* The student wondered. This confusion spread.

Guan Yu watched Liu Gang, a sly grin forming. The man was clueless: all forty notes contained real answers. Liu Gang’s stupidity defied description.

Two minutes left.

Liu Gang habitually glanced toward his informant—only to freeze. Lip-reading their silent warning, his face drained of color.

Whirling around, he spotted a paper ball arcing through the air.

Without thinking, his bulky frame lunged.

**Chapter 577: Bumblebee Joins Forces with the Hulk (Part 1)**

No one expected the beer-bellied, 200-pound man to move like a gymnast.

Mid-air, a faint *crack* sounded from his waist. Liu Gang grimaced—he’d thrown out his back. But the paper ball loomed close. Gritting teeth, he stretched…

His fingertips brushed the note—then searing pain struck. The ball slipped past as he crashed face-first, shaking the floor.

The class erupted in laughter. Eyewitnesses reenacted the pratfall, forgetting the exam entirely.

Seizing the chaos, Wang Zhen orchestrated answer-sharing. “Distract them,” he urged. “Buy time for the rest!”

Liu Gang, facedown, burned with humiliation. Every laugh stabbed his pride. He yearned to scream expulsions, but his body refused. Back agony pinned him. Worse, his nose—crushed against tiles—glowed crimson.

Yet victory felt close. One captured note would seal Guan Yu’s fate. Groaning, he pushed up, face a grotesque mask: swollen nose, dirt-streaked cheeks—a circus clown.

Fresh laughter exploded.

Ignoring it, he staggered toward a student hastily copying answers. But a buzz filled his ears—the same from earlier.

A bee materialized at his nose. Enraged, Liu Gang swatted—only to get stung. The class howled as he slapped his own face.

Three more bees attacked. Retreating, he covered his face—futilely, as stings peppered his hands. When five bees emerged, he fled backward.

Six minutes remained. Desperate, Liu Gang charged again…

**Chapter 578: Bumblebee Joins Forces with the Hulk (Part 2)**

Three emerald-winged flies materialized, blocking his path. Their gaze held unnerving hostility.

Liu Gang scoffed internally—*Since when fear insects?*—but momentum carried him forward.

The flies struck with military precision: two dive-bombed his eyes, forcing them shut. The third hovered at his lips.

Blinded, Liu Gang never saw the outstretched foot.

He tripped spectacularly, belly-flopping. This time, his face stayed upward—sparing his nose but showcasing three flies perched smugly on his lips and cheeks.

The class gaped. Even answer-copiers paused.

In their collective memory, nothing this bizarre had ever occurred.
