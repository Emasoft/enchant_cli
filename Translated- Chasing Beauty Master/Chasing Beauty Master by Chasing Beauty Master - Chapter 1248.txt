“Opening the door, it was indeed Jinciyu Lang holding two large bags of food. Unexpectedly, he'd brought so much breakfast.”

“Hurry in and eat together!” Lin Qiaoqiao said cheerfully. She'd been waiting for this breakfast for a long time, already smelling the fragrance of millet porridge.

Without ceremony, Jinciyu Lang strode in carrying the breakfast. After placing it on the coffee table, he asked, “Where’s Guanyu? Call him out quickly to eat. We need to continue our journey after this.”

Qiaoqiao bounced into the bedroom to wake Guanyu. Sensing something amiss, Jinciyu Lang stood up and followed her into the room.

Seeing Guanyu sleeping like a dead hog on the bed, Jinciyu Lang exploded in anger. “Qiaoqiao! Didn’t you say Guanyu told me to bring breakfast upstairs?”

“Yes, that’s right. What’s wrong?”

Jinciyu Lang pointed at the snoring figure. “He’s been asleep this whole time! When did he tell you anything?”

Realizing her lie was exposed, Qiaoqiao blurted, “Ah... Of course Guanyu told me! He fell back asleep because you took too long!”

Though unconvinced, Jinciyu Lang decided to let it pass. After all, he couldn’t do anything to Qiaoqiao even if he wanted to.

“Guanyu! Get up and eat!” Qiaoqiao yanked the blankets off the sleeping man, who remained dead to the world.

Returning to the living room, Jinciyu Lang started eating alone. After two bites, he noticed someone missing. “Where’s Siqi?”

Chapter 3,208: Just Abandon It

Deciding not to wait, he focused on his meal. He’d bought four portions – one for each person. If Guanyu didn’t wake soon, Jinciyu Lang resolved to eat his portion too.

As he ate heartily, Siqi emerged from her room, drawn by the aroma. Jinciyu Lang waved her over. “Siqi, come eat. We’ll depart after.”

“Where’s Guanyu? Still asleep?” Siqi asked curiously, having heard voices earlier.

“Forget that lazybones. Let’s eat first,” Jinciyu Lang advised.

It was clear from the sleeping arrangements that Guanyu had shared a room with Qiaoqiao while Siqi slept alone. Jinciyu Lang thought it wasteful – if he were Guanyu, he’d have kept both beauties company. Though he knew Qiaoqiao would never agree, let alone Siqi.

“Wake up! Time to eat!”

As Qiaoqiao’s calls continued, Jinciyu Lang found his meal tasting even better. Finishing his portion, he claimed Guanyu’s share too. By the time Guanyu finally rose, he and Qiaoqiao had to share one meal between them.

Though Jinciyu Lang caused this situation, Qiaoqiao seemed happiest about it, quietly thanking him.

After breakfast, the group resumed their journey. Well-rested, Guanyu drove swiftly. By noon, they approached the town where their van could go no further.

Northwest of town lay only narrow horse trails through dense vegetation. Leaving their expensive van at the Lin residence, the group acquired horses from Lin Zhonggeng. The bumpy ride left Jinciyu Lang and Guanyu dizzy, while Qiaoqiao remained unbothered.

Siqi complained bitterly about the jostling, choosing instead to fly discreetly above. The terrible road conditions had likely destroyed the vehicle’s undercarriage, but abandoning such an expensive car wasn’t an option.

After entrusting the van to Lin Zhonggeng and securing horses, the group pressed on toward Yunqing Sect. Guanyu needed to complete storing spells in the Emperor’s Seal for protection, especially after encountering mysterious黑衣men near Tiger Head Peak. He sensed impending trouble at Yunqing Sect – trouble that might not concern him directly, but definitely involved Siqi.

Chapter 3,209: No Relation Whatsoever

At lunch in the Lin household, only Jinciyu Lang ate heartily while others picked at their food. Lin Zhonggeng and his wife wanted Qiaoqiao to return to her important job in City A, but she resisted, unwilling to leave Guanyu – especially with Siqi around.

“Dad, my job can wait! Let me take one more month off,” Qiaoqiao pleaded, eyeing Siqi warily. She couldn’t risk leaving this rival unchallenged.

Lin Zhonggeng insisted, “You’ve been gone over a month already. Such a good position shouldn’t be neglected.”

Though knowing her father’s efforts to secure the job, Qiaoqiao cared more about staying with Guanyu. “Guanyu, let’s return to City A together! Why bother with Yunqing Sect? Must you really learn these spells?”

Guanyu shook his head. “I can’t disappoint Jiushiye. Cultivation isn’t optional for me.” His sealed inner energy left him no choice but to pursue magical studies.

After much persuasion, Qiaoqiao reluctantly agreed to return, realizing she couldn’t control Guanyu’s choices. “Fine. But Guanyu, tell those women at Qiaoyuan District I’m not responsible if anything happens to you now!”

She emphasized this for Siqi’s benefit, listing all the women in Guanyu’s life – Xue Jing, Lü Mei, Zhang Han, Sakurako, Yang Conghan, Lan Yu. The Lin parents exchanged surprised glances but remained tactfully silent.

Siqi maintained her composure, seemingly unfazed. Jinciyu Lang smirked at Guanyu’s predicament.

“I’ll stay at Qiaoyuan District,” Qiaoqiao declared. “I’ll need the modified Dahang motorcycle. You’ll pay for my room decorations there too!”

Guanyu sighed, knowing his modified motorcycle’s 60mph acceleration was too powerful for most. Even skilled driver Lan Yu had nearly crashed it. “Do as you wish,” he conceded.

Chapter 3,210: Hope and Disappointment

As they parted, Qiaoqiao watched Guanyu ride away with complex emotions. Her father comforted her, “Don’t set expectations too high, daughter. That way, you avoid both excessive hope and crushing disappointment.”

Mounting their horses, Guanyu, Jinciyu Lang and Siqi headed for Yunqing Sect. Qiaoqiao stood at the gate, understanding that true feelings couldn’t be forced. If Guanyu cared, distance wouldn’t matter. If not, constant proximity meant nothing.

She only hoped for a small place in his heart, like his other connections. Watching them disappear, she swallowed her longing – this bold, modern woman had done all she could. The rest depended on fate.
