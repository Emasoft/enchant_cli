“Jinhua was about to say more, but Guan Yu raised his hand to stop her. Guan Yu said to Manager Yue Wei, “Thank you anyway for showing us the surveillance footage. We’ve troubled you today, but we’re done here. Goodbye.”

“Oh, alright. Take care,” Yue Wei stood up with a genial smile. “If you need any help, feel free to come find me again.”

“Thank you in advance, though I doubt we’ll need to bother you further. I initially planned to just ask the server a few questions after finding him, but now it seems I’ll have to report this to the police. I’m sure they’ll get to the bottom of it. Goodbye.” With that, Guan Yu pulled Jinhua out.

Da Ke grew visibly anxious upon hearing Guan Yu mention the police, his face tightening with panic. After Guan Yu left, Yue Wei shot Da Ke a glance and shook his head, long accustomed to Da Ke’s erratic behavior.

As they stepped outside, Jinhua asked, “Are we really going to the police? Will it help?”

“Of course. I’ll explain everything to them and have them help track down that male server.”

Jinhua nodded. “Seems like our only option now. That Da Ke is infuriating. I’d love to throw a handful of itching powder in his face.”

“No need to waste energy on someone like him. I suspect Da Ke is deeply involved—he’s probably closely connected to that server.” Guan Yu started the car and headed toward the police station.

Jinhua, recalling Da Ke’s lecherous demeanor and the server’s gaze toward Feng Xihu, ventured, “Do you think the server might be Da Ke’s subordinate, or that they’re working together?”

“Very likely,” Guan Yu replied. “Da Ke clearly shielded him. Normally, getting an employee’s contact info wouldn’t be an issue, but his refusal speaks volumes. Since he won’t cooperate, we’ll let the police extract it.”

As they spoke, Da Ke was upstairs in the restaurant office chastising Yue Wei. “How could you just show the surveillance footage to anyone? That violates restaurant protocols!”

“What’s there to hide? We’re a legitimate business, not some shady operation. I’d even post the footage online. Besides, I reviewed it—that server was clearly at fault. Once the police arrive, you’ll have no choice but to comply.”

Had it been Yue Wei’s decision, he would’ve handed over the server’s contacts. Guan Yu seemed trustworthy, while the server appeared suspicious.

Da Ke, hearing the police were imminent, stood abruptly. “I just remembered an urgent matter. I need to go.” He hurried out, leaving Yue Wei baffled but indifferent.

After rounding a corner, Guan Yu U-turned and parked where the restaurant entrance was visible in the rearview mirror.

“Are we waiting for Da Ke to come out?” Jinhua asked.

“Smart.” No sooner had Guan Yu spoken than Da Ke emerged, flustered, and sped off in an aged white sedan with a long hood and trunk.

Guan Yu tailed the car at a distance, careful not to be noticed. The white sedan wound through streets until abruptly turning left at an intersection Guan Yu recognized from the surveillance footage—the same route the server had fled the previous night.

Navigating heavier traffic, Guan Yu closed the gap. “Where is he going?” Jinhua wondered.

“No idea. If Feng Xihu were here, she could at least serve as a human GPS,” Guan Yu grumbled.

“Look! He’s turning into that alley! He must be meeting last night’s server!” Jinhua exclaimed.

“Just focus on not losing him,” Guan Yu said. The sedan maintained a moderate pace, Da Ke oblivious to pursuit as he raced to meet the server.

**Chapter 2341: The Situation Escalates**

Da Ke’s mind raced—if the police investigated, more than last night’s incident would surface. The server, You Dun Shaqi Ma, was his cousin. The two had colluded for years: Da Ke, a lecherous Northerner with a history of assault, exploited his managerial role to recruit You Dun, who used poison to incapacitate female patrons for their twisted schemes.

Last night, targeting Feng Xihu had backfired when Guan Yu intervened, leaving You Dun injured. Da Ke had advised laying low, but Guan Yu’s visit and threat to involve the police forced drastic action. Now, Da Ke urgently needed to relocate You Dun before authorities closed in.

After fifteen minutes of winding through desolate streets, the white sedan stopped before a warehouse. Guan Yu parked discreetly around the corner. The rusted iron gate creaked as they slipped inside, alerting Da Ke, who bolted toward an inner door.

Guan Yu swiftly tackled him. “Run now!” Guan Yu taunted. Beyond the door stood You Dun, frozen under the aim of Guan Yu’s golden pistol.

**Chapter 2342: I Don’t Need Money**

Da Ke pleaded, “Let’s talk this out! No need for violence! If it’s about last night, I’ll compensate you—name your price!”

Guan Yu smirked. “Do I look like I need money?”

“What do you want? You weren’t even harmed! Just lower the gun!”

“You seemed so bold earlier. Where’s that arrogance now?”

Da Ke’s voice trembled. “I-I was just bluffing! Please, take whatever you want!”

Guan Yu’s smile turned icy. “You’ll answer for every crime—starting with the women you’ve tormented here.”

As Da Ke and You Dun exchanged terrified glances, Guan Yu motioned to Jinhua. “Call the police. This ends now.”
