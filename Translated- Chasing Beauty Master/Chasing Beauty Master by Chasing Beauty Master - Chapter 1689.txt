“I slept very well, better than I have in many days,” Guan Yu said, holding Siqi in his embrace. Siqi felt incomparably warm. She added, “Guan Yu, I think it’s time for me to go out now. If others see us sleeping together like this, it might cause trouble. Also, could you go wake Wang Jun? Tell him to return.”

Guan Yu considered her words. If it were anyone else, he wouldn’t worry, but he feared Lin Chen and Ling Su. If those two discovered Siqi had slept beside him, their resentment would surely grow.

“Alright, I’ll go wake Wang Jun now,” Guan Yu replied. He left the tent and entered Siqi’s tent, where Wang Jun lay sound asleep. Guan Yu hesitated to disturb him, but time pressed. He had no choice.

Outside, the campfire had died. The morning air carried a chill. Guan Yu reached into Siqi’s tent to fetch her a coat, intending to drape it over her later to ward off the cold.

Wang Jun yawned lazily. “You two should leave. I want to sleep a little longer.” Siqi smiled apologetically, acknowledging the inconvenience, and hurried away.

**Chapter 4416: Assigning Tasks**

The hour remained early, and the others still slept. Siqi returned to her tent. Dawn had broken, so she no longer felt afraid.

With nothing pressing to do, Guan Yu lay down to rest briefly, conserving energy for the day’s journey ahead.

Yet after a moment’s thought, he rose and stepped out to count the camels. Fortunately, none were missing—a testament to the tranquility of the area.

Before departing the Cloud Azure Sect, Elder Xuanming had given Guan Yu a rudimentary map marking the optimal route through the desert. After studying it, Guan Yu calculated they would reach Ox Town by noon. Pushing onward would risk being stranded in the open at nightfall.

He decided it wiser to rest in Ox Town, retire early, and depart at dawn the next day. This way, they could reach Camel Town by midnight, avoiding another night under the stars.

Assuming the group agreed, Guan Yu resolved to propose this plan once everyone awoke.

Breakfast consisted of dry rations. After a hasty meal, the caravan set out. Siqi drifted closer to Guan Yu, her thoughts lingering on the warmth of sharing his bed the previous night. Her heart fluttered like a thief’s first caper—nervous yet exhilarated. Though they’d slept only four hours, it felt deeply fulfilling.

Siqi sensed their bond had deepened, filling her with quiet joy. She gravitated toward him unconsciously.

Lin Chen, meanwhile, had dismissed the previous night’s incident as a fleeting dream—an inconsequential accident.

“Siqi, are you tired? Should we rest?” Lin Chen rode his camel alongside her.

“Not at all. Riding a camel is far more comfortable than a horse,” Siqi replied. “But we’re nearing Ox Town, aren’t we? Let me ask Guan Yu about our plans.”

Seizing the excuse, she approached Guan Yu. “Will we rest in Ox Town ahead?”

“Of course. We’ll replenish supplies there for emergencies. We must conserve our strength before entering the desert,” Guan Yu said. “I propose staying overnight, then departing early tomorrow. By tomorrow’s midnight, we’ll reach Camel Town. That way, we avoid camping outdoors again.”

“I agree. The others likely will too,” Siqi affirmed.

The group approved Guan Yu’s plan upon hearing it. They soon arrived at Ox Town.

Elder Xuanming’s map had marked Ox Town with only a small circle, leading Guan Yu to expect a humble settlement. Yet upon arrival, they found a bustling town sprawling at the desert’s edge, unwalled but peaceful.

“Quite lively here,” Wang Jun remarked cheerfully.

Guan Yu tasked Lin Chen with finding an inn, trusting his financial stewardship. He saw no need to micromanage.

“I never imagined Ox Town would be this large. The market seems prosperous,” Guan Yu observed.

Most townsfolk led camels rather than horses—practical beasts for the arid climate. Lin Chen soon returned, having secured rooms at the town’s most reputable inn.

Though Ox Town’s architecture remained modest—mostly single or double-story structures to withstand desert winds—the inn met their needs. As usual, Siqi received her own room, the sole woman in their party treated like precious jade.

Lin Chen assigned room keys, declaring, “Aze and I will share a room tonight,” brooking no argument. This left Wang Jun and Ling Su as reluctant roommates.

Guan Yu found himself stationed outside Siqi’s door again—a familiar sentry duty. Recalling their previous nighttime conversation, he didn’t mind.

After a simple meal, Guan Yu announced, “Rest here today. Anyone needing supplies may shop, but don’t get lost—I won’t fund rescue missions. Those needing silver may borrow from me.”

**Chapter 4417: Roasted Sweet Potatoes**

Guan Yu’s generosity stemmed from necessity—all knew Elder Xuanming had provided ample funds. Stinginess would invite criticism.

Wang Jun scowled, approaching Guan Yu. “Lend me silver for a separate room. I refuse to stay with Ling Su.”

Aze mirrored the request, complaining about Lin Chen’s nocturnal noises. Guan Yu relented, handing each two silver ingots.

“You’re wealthy enough,” Wang Jun shrugged when Guan Yu teased him about frugality. “Why quibble over trifles?”

“Just get rooms,” Guan Yu laughed, tossing more silver. “And book an extra luxury suite for me.”

That afternoon, while others napped, Guan Yu wandered the town seeking a gift for Siqi—something small, given their journey’s constraints.

Ox Town’s dwellings displayed sun-dried meats and pickled vegetables in windows—staples in this arid climate where fresh produce grew scarce. Vendors peddled imported fruits to inns rather than households.

As stalls began closing early against the coming chill, Guan Yu caught a familiar aroma—roasted sweet potatoes. Following the scent, he found an elderly woman tending a cylindrical oven.

“How much for these?” Guan Yu asked, eyeing the golden tubers.

“Three coppers for large, two for small,” the woman replied. “Best hurry home before sunset.”

“I’ll take all.” Guan Yu overpaid with silver, moved by her makeshift bed beside the oven.

The woman explained the town’s early closures: “Night frost bites hard here.” She herself lived by the oven, her husband’s legacy after decades alone.

Guan Yu accepted the bundled sweet potatoes, sympathy stirring though he couldn’t alter her fate. As twilight deepened, he hurried back, treats in hand.

**Chapter 4418: Save One for Me**

“Save one for me!” Wang Jun called as Guan Yu distributed the fragrant tubers. The group gathered, savoring the rare warmth, their breath visible in the cooling air.

Ling Su eyed the smallest potato but remained silent. Guan Yu tossed it to him anyway. “Eat. Tomorrow’s march won’t be gentle.”

As the sweet aroma mingled with woodsmoke, Siqi leaned against Guan Yu’s shoulder. The desert waited, but for now, contentment reigned—a fleeting moment of camaraderie under the vast, star-strewn sky.
