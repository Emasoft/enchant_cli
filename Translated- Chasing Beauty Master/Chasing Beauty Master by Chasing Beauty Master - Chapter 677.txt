Suddenly, a voice as faint as a mosquito’s hum whispered by Guan Yu’s ear: “How many lovers do you have now?”

After a moment’s contemplation, Guan Yu replied, “Four, if we don’t count that little imp of a girl.”

“Oh, four already,” Sakurako murmured casually, as if merely making small talk. Guan Yu thought nothing of it.

A short while later, Sakurako spoke again: “Then… would you mind having one more lover?”

Guan Yu chuckled softly, turning to gaze at her profile. “Well, if it’s you… I wouldn’t mind at all.” Though they had known each other barely a day, Sakurako had clearly fallen for this man from Huaxia. And Guan Yu? He too felt an undeniable pull toward her.

Sakurako twisted her body, nestling into Guan Yu’s embrace. She nuzzled her head contentedly against his chest and declared, “Then it’s settled,” before drifting off to sleep. Her abrupt slumber left Guan Yu, who had anticipated further affection, thoroughly disappointed.

**Chapter 1720: Ruinous Interruption**

Mid-cultivation, Guan Yu suddenly felt a tightness below his waist. Opening his eyes, he found Sakurako still drowsy, yet her right hand had slipped beneath his arm to firmly grasp “Little Guan Yu.”

By then, Sakurako had fully awakened. Realizing what she held, she gasped, releasing her grip as her cheeks flushed crimson. Clutching Guan Yu’s waist, she buried her face in his chest, too mortified to meet his gaze. Squirming slightly, she explained, “I… I dreamt someone pressed a gun against my back. It was so uncomfortable… I didn’t mean to grab you there!”

Like sleep, cultivation allowed the body to rest and recover. Despite being confined in Watanabe Corporation’s detention cell, neither Guan Yu nor Sakurako felt fear. After hours of cultivation, Guan Yu had regained peak condition—and with it, the natural physical reactions of a virile man.

Hearing Sakurako’s flustered words, Guan Yu’s heart stirred. He nearly gave in to the urge to claim her then and there. Eastern Island women, he mused, possessed a uniquely alluring charm compared to their Huaxia counterparts—a legacy of their culture’s male-dominant ethos. Raised watching mothers serve fathers like devoted handmaidens, they learned early to worship their men as sovereigns, mastering every art of pleasing them.

Most Eastern Island surnames derived from locations—Matsushita (Under-the-Pine), Inoue (Above-the-Well), Tanaka (Middle-Field), Murakami (Village-Upper), Watanabe (Crossing-Edge), Takahashi (High-Bridge). This tradition originated in ancient wartime population crises, when women were mandated to carry quilts during travels, ready for impromptu couplings with any man who fancied them. Children knew only their mothers and birthplace surnames, not their fathers.

Men worldwide coveted Eastern Island wives for their devotion. Guan Yu never imagined his current visit would bring him someone like Sakurako.

“Aren’t you already my lover? Why so shy?” Guan Yu lifted Sakurako’ chin, amused by her tightly shut eyes.

“From the moment I saw you,” Sakurako admitted, “I knew we’d be together. It was… a certainty. But… this is Watanabe Corporation. It’s not proper here.” Though no cultivator herself, Sakurako’s feminine intuition detected the desire simmering within Guan Yu.

Guan Yu captured her lips in a deep kiss. Sakurako melted against him with a soft moan, pliant as silk. Had he chosen to undress her now, she’d offer no resistance.

His hand drifted to her chest, fingers brushing the top button. Sakurako’s trembling hand closed over his, palm feverish—a half-hearted protest that instead pressed his touch deeper.

Just as the first button yielded, a metallic clang shattered the moment. Harsh light flooded the basement as the door crashed open. A voice snarled, “Damn! This Huaxia punk’s got balls—flirting even in captivity!”

Guan Yu’s fury spiked at the interruption. Glaring at the first-class mutant Inoue, he spat, “Screw your mother! Ever heard ‘those who ruin trysts birth assless sons’? Keep barking, and I’ll seal your asshole shut—see how long before shit bursts your guts!”

Inoue, among Eastern Island’s elite mutants, gaped at such vulgarity. “Bastard!” he roared, lunging forward.

A second-class mutant halted him. “Sir Inoue! Remember our mission. Let the fool rant—he’ll soon go mad like the other test subjects.”

Inoue wheeled, slashing at the wall. His palm-blade left a meter-long gash in the half-meter-thick iron plating. Sakurako paled—such power!

“Guan Yu… will you be safe?” she whispered.

Deliberately loud, Guan Yu scoffed, “This fly? I could crush him with two fingers.”

Inoue, enhanced by Eastern Island tech, deemed himself the world’s strongest mutant. Watanabe’s warnings about Guan Yu’s potential meant nothing—he’d kill the Huaxian with a flick.

“Huaxia swine,” Inoue sneered, jabbing a finger. “After testing, if you survive, I’ll snap every bone, slice flesh daily, leave you a beating heart watching your own decay! You’ll beg for death’s mercy!”

Sakurako trembled, but Guan Yu yawned. “Ants get swift squashes. You’d get no such luxury.”

The taunt worked. Enraged, Inoue unleashed more wall-slashing before netting Guan Yu in special alloy mesh. Dragged from the cell, Guan Yu noted Inoue’s palm-blade technique—useful intel.

**Chapter 1721: Testing Grounds**

Watching Guan Yu go, Sakurako felt her heart tear away. Earlier, curled against him, she’d pondered why no past suitor stirred her like this Huaxian. The answer: fate.

Fate—elusive yet indelible. Sometimes, a single glance ignites lifelong resonance. Huaxia and Eastern Island, divergent cultures and histories—why this profound connection? Sakurako didn’t care. She’d give her life for this man.

“Release him! Take me instead!” She gripped the bars, screaming.

Inoue and the second-class mutant froze. They’d assumed Guan Yu forced himself on Watanabe’s heiress. This devotion was inconceivable. Eastern Island’s bachelors had wooed Sakurako in vain—yet she’d surrender to a foreigner overnight?

“Slut!” Inoue spat. “Fancying this Huaxia pig? You’ll never see him again!”

Mindful of the Takahashi conglomerate’s might—especially after last night’s encounter with Takahashi Ichiro’s formidable mutant—Inoue restrained himself. But rage fueled cruelty. They dragged Guan Yu across gravel, the net scraping bloody wounds. Guan Yu feigned vulnerability, saving power for later vengeance—he’d turn these mutants against their masters.

He pieced together Watanabe’s scheme: international abduction for cross-ethnic mutant trials. Small Eastern Island couldn’t mass-produce homegrown variants without backlash. Most citizens opposed war, but warmongers clung to power, tarnishing national image.

As Sakurako wept, her mind flashed—Guan Yu’s divine consciousness projected images: the second courtyard from last night. Though wordless, the message soothed—he was safe, infiltrating by design.

**Chapter 1722: Counter-Invasion**

The testing room held modified equipment—outer instruments resembling transmitters, inner chamber with a metal chair. Inoue clamped Guan Yu down, snarling, “Enjoy our technology, swine!” before fitting a multicolored-wired helmet.

Guan Yu recognized electromagnetic brainwave manipulation tech. Though confident in his defenses, he shielded his mind while probing surroundings. An elderly scientist in white lab coat waited outside—electronics expert. Watanabe entered, threatening: “This Huaxia martial artist’s brain can handle full-strength waves. Fail again, and face His Majesty’s wrath!”

The scientist quivered. Guan Yu noted the Emperor’s involvement—the royal family’s perennial power grab. Despite Japan’s democracy, many still revered the divine monarch. Recent events—like “War God Ito’s” return from demonic realms—had emboldened imperial ambitions.

Watanabe ordered activation. Faint EM waves penetrated Guan Yu’s skull, targeting cerebral folds. Normally, more folds meant higher intellect, but these waves sought deeper conquest. Guan Yu permitted partial access, nearly overwhelmed as the waves ignited neural magma.

His spiritual sense mapped the brain’s staggering complexity—a labyrinth dwarfing supercomputers. The experiment revealed more than Watanabe intended: Guan Yu now understood the true scope of their brainwashing tech.

Feigning distress, he gathered intel. The Emperor’s plan involved mass-producing loyal mutants through EM control. But Guan Yu’s consciousness, honed through cultivation, began reverse-engineering the waves—turning the weapon against its creators.
