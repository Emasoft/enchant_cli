Li Yuanshan’s eyes darted around, then a sudden flash of inspiration struck him. He thought of a perfect excuse to extricate himself from this awkward predicament. Stretching lazily and yawning, he feigned exhaustion. “Why do I suddenly feel so tired? Seems I didn’t sleep well. I’ll go upstairs to catch up on rest. You two carry on—pretend I was never here. Heh!”



If he hadn’t said anything, it might have been better. But his words only deepened Guan Yu’s shame, who had been on the verge of mischief.



How could he have imagined that Li Yuanshan would live in the same villa as Li Xi? Or that Li Yuanshan would stumble upon this scene at such an inopportune moment?



Perhaps out of the shame of being caught in the act, Guan Yu panicked.



He hastily withdrew his hand from between Li Xi’s breasts. In his fluster, he didn’t notice the position of his hand as he pulled it back, accidentally snagging the edge of her lingerie.



If not for the tug, things might have been fine. But with excessive force, Guan Yu ended up yanking off Li Xi’s black lace bra.



As for Li Xi herself, freed from the bra’s constraint, her body leaned toward Guan Yu, collapsing into his arms.



It looked as though the two were intimately entwined. The only glaring detail was the exposed black lace lingerie, which Li Yuanshan happened to catch in full view.



Fortunately, Li Yuanshan only saw that much. The freed, voluptuous breasts pressed against Guan Yu’s firm chest, their softness endlessly stimulating his nerves, leaving him both secretly thrilled and painfully aroused.



This…



Guan Yu and Li Yuanshan were both stunned—though for different reasons. Guan Yu pretended ignorance, while Li Yuanshan was genuinely dumbfounded.



As for why Guan Yu feigned cluelessness, well, it’s obvious!



Li Yuanshan, however, was truly bewildered.



“I’m right here, and not only do you two not restrain yourselves, you escalate things? With an old man still present?”



Li Yuanshan was speechless, though inwardly thrilled.



Li Xi’s high standards had once made him question her romantic inclinations. But witnessing this, his long-held wish for grandchildren seemed within reach.



“Ahem… Youth today are something else. An old fogey like me can’t keep up. Haha! Carry on—don’t mind me. I’ll leave you to it.”



Li Yuanshan tactfully excused himself, not wanting to hinder the “bonding” he so eagerly anticipated.



His exit wasn’t to his room but straight out the villa door—giving Guan Yu and Li Xi ample privacy.



Guan Yu was left speechless.



Li Xi, meanwhile, burned with humiliation.



“He’s gone. Do you still want to continue?” Her icy voice cut through the air.



“Yes!” Guan Yu blurted, then immediately regretted it.



Li Xi’s face darkened. She shoved him away, tearing her lingerie in the process.



The sound of fabric ripping echoed. Guan Yu found himself holding her black lace bra, stunned.



“You… want this back?” he asked awkwardly.



Li曦 snatched it, glaring. “Pervert!”



After a tense exchange, Li Xi stormed upstairs to change.



Later, she reappeared in a stunning white blouse and black skirt, her cold elegance contrasting sharply with earlier disarray.



“Let’s go,” she said curtly, ignoring Guan Yu’s lingering gaze.



As they left, Guan宇 couldn’t resist one last tease: “Maybe wear something less… distracting next time.”



Li曦’s icy glare spoke volumes.



Outside, Guan宇 chuckled to himself, reveling in the rare glimpse of her flustered demeanor.



**Chapter 918: That Alluring Black**



The torn lingerie incident left both reeling. Guan宇’s accidental exposure of Li Xi’s breasts burned in his memory, fueling both regret and mischievous satisfaction.



**Chapter 919: Unreasonable Demand**



Their charged banter continued, Guan宇’s cheeky misinterpretations clashing with Li Xi’s mounting frustration. As they departed for their errand, the unresolved tension hung thick—a blend of mutual attraction and exasperation that neither could fully escape.
