“Hmph, we should be asking you! What are you doing here skulking around?” Liu Yishou retorted.

The young man pointed behind himself with a hint of grievance. “Can’t you see this?”

Guan Yu glanced at the bamboo basket strapped to the youth’s back, filled with medicinal herbs. “You came here to gather herbs?”

Nodding, the youth replied, “Why else would I carry this?”

Liu Yishou snorted skeptically. “You might fool him, but not me! As a lifelong resident of Barren Town, I’ve never heard of rare herbs in this mass grave. Nor have I ever seen you before. Speak truthfully—who are you?”

The youth stammered incoherently under interrogation. Guan Yu signaled Liu with a look. “Old Liu, ease your pressure. Let’s hear his explanation.”

Relaxing slightly, Liu growled, “Fine. Explain yourself properly, or face the consequences!”

Guan Yu smiled wryly at the intimidation tactic. Trembling, the herbalist removed his basket and produced plants. “How unreasonable! I’m just an herb gatherer. Don’t believe me? Examine these yourself!”

Uncertain, Guan Yu turned to Liu. “Are these genuine herbs?”

Watching Liu harass the herbalist, Guan Yu intervened. “Old Liu, since he’s not our target, let him go. We have urgent matters.”

Though Guan Yu spoke thus, suspicion lingered. Something felt amiss, though he couldn’t pinpoint what.

The herbalist bowed gratefully. “Thank you for your mercy!” Suddenly he inquired, “Might I ask what you gentlemen seek here?”

“Leave now before misfortune finds you!” Liu snapped.

Guan Yu studied the youth anew, seeking clues. “Aren’t you afraid to gather herbs here, boy?”

“Afraid? Why should herb-collecting be dangerous?”

“Need you ask?” Guan Yu scoffed. “As a local, haven’t you heard the mass grave legends?”

The herbalist paled momentarily before recovering. “Legends remain legends. Why take them seriously?”

Guan Yu’s suspicion deepened as the youth edged toward Liu. “What are you doing?!” he barked.

Startled, Liu whirled to find the herbalist behind him. The old man leapt back defensively. “Treacherous whelp! Dare you ambush me?!”

“Wronged! I’m but a powerless herbalist!” The youth raised his open palm, revealing a pea-sized white grub. Liu recoiled in recognition. “Pale Corpse Worm!”

Though unfamiliar with the creature, Guan Yu tensed at Liu’s alarm. The youth crushed the larva, releasing foul-smelling fluid. “Fear not. Though repulsive, these worms can’t harm cultivators like you.”

Guan Yu narrowed his eyes. “How does a ‘powerless herbalist’ perceive our cultivation levels? And why show no fear of this dreaded insect?”

The youth smiled cryptically. “Apothecaries grow immune to such creatures.”

“Apothecary?” Guan Yu echoed curiously.

Liu explained, “True apothecaries are rare—less than ten thousand in Blue Beauty Continent. They craft high-grade elixirs.”

“This boy makes those?” Guan Yu eyed the youth skeptically.

The herbalist huffed, “Doubt my craft? Your ignorance astounds!”

“But you lack magical aura! Neither elf nor dragon—how concoct enchanted pills?”

The youth applauded. “As my master warned—you’re sharper than you look!”

“Master? Reveal yourself!” Guan Yu assumed combat stance.

**Chapter 1383: Lang Tianhua**

“Courteous words should be mine!” The herbalist’s form twisted grotesquely—features warping into bestial ferocity.

Liu gasped. “Young Master Guan! This is the monster we seek!”

“So it’s you!” Liu snarled, recalling yesterday’s ambush. “I’ll flay your hide!”

The creature tsked. “Foolish elder! Spared yesterday, you return to die?”

Guan Yu laughed mirthlessly. “Monsters with human wit? How novel!”

“Mock while you can, Magus-level brat!” the beast sneered. “You’ll learn my power!”

“You know my name?” Guan Yu stiffened.

“Guan Yu, seeking elf named Locke.” The creature smirked. “My traps failed earlier, but no matter. For posterity—I am Lang Tianhua!”

“Wolf Heavenly Splendor?” Guan Yu muttered, noting lupine features.

“Human, actually,” Lang sneered. “Trapped here after the Elf Wars. My family...” Rage contorted his face. “My mother died grieving! Wife fled with child! Such ‘honorable guardianship’ deserves blood repayment!”

Liu whispered urgently, “The stories—after war’s end, General Lin Zhenmi trapped soldiers here as gravekeepers. Later, Lin died... bitten.”

Lang’s eyes blazed. “You remember well! That tyrant’s ‘honor’ destroyed lives! My vengeance transcends elf hatred!”

Liu continued tremulously, “The garrison vanished. Search parties died... necks pierced... like Lin.”

“Poisoned!” Guan Yu realized.

“Clever,” Lang purred. “My family’s suffering demands more than Lin’s blood! This town’s life-force shall fuel my ascension!”

Guan Yu’s hands glowed combat-ready. “Your madness ends here!”

Lang’s claws extended. “Foolish hero! Let’s see your Magus arts withstand Corpse Emperor’s might!”
