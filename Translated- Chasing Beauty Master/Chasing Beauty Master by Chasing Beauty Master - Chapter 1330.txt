The grand artificial mountain in the flower bed appeared quite imposing. Guanyu mused that given the local manpower and resources, transporting such massive rocks without modern vehicles must have been tremendously difficult. These wealthy individuals spare no effort for aesthetics, he thought coldly as he circled the structure. "This isn't relocated from elsewhere," he muttered to himself. "They carved this from an existing natural boulder through extensive craftsmanship."

The engineering feat impressed him - countless artisans must have labored to sculpt this monolith into such elegant form. His contemplation was interrupted by Siqi's sudden approach, making him start. How had he failed to notice her arrival? This lapse in awareness troubled him deeply. Were this an ambush, he'd already be dead. His defensive instincts were clearly weakening without Jinciyu Lang's protection.

"Brother Jinci is in my room," Guanyu explained. "I needed to request another chamber."

Siqi nodded. "Guanyu, Xiao Zhi mentioned your plan to visit the Demon Soul Sect. That's too dangerous! The Demon Lord..."

Guanyu cursed Xiao Zhi's loose tongue. "The Demon Lord considers me insignificant," he countered. "With my artifacts confiscated, I pose no threat."

"But why would he invite you then?" Siqi pressed. "You destroyed Black Blood Ridge, a demonic branch sect. This could be retaliation!"

"Were I truly marked for death, the Left Envoy could have slain me weeks ago," Guanyu reasoned. "The Demon Lord wants something. Perhaps negotiation."

When Siqi insisted on accompanying him, Guanyu gently refused. "The sect's stronghold permits no outsiders. Trust me - I'll return unharmed." He patted her shoulder, privately reassured by his hidden artifacts - the Imperial Seal and fully-charged Soulfall Blade.

Their conversation was interrupted by Steward Sun announcing new quarters. As Guanyu departed, Siqi's parting words carried veiled jealousy: "At least Wang Xiaorong will protect you there."

Meanwhile at Demon Soul Sect headquarters, the Demon Lord sipped tea while receiving reports. "Red Lotus Sect dared attack Xiaorong?" His calm voice belied danger. "Zhang Siwu sent his elite disciple covertly to Qujiang? And the Freakish Cavern sect remains elusive?"

The Left Envoy bowed. "Our informants confirm Freakish Cavern's women vanished completely. Regarding Guanyu... he accepted your invitation."

"Interesting." The Demon Lord's eyes narrowed. "Either recruit that dual-cultivator talent... or eliminate future trouble." His subordinate voiced concerns about Wang Xiaorong's affections, but the ruler dismissed them. "Sentiment cannot hinder our plans."

Elsewhere in Cloud Azure Sect, Chief Zheng communicated via black ingot with Xiao Zhi. "Guanyu mustn't go! The Demon Lord's schemes..." Static interrupted as the magical device drained Xiao Zhi's energy.

At dawn, Guanyu discovered Steward Sun "pruning" undisturbed foliage near the artificial mountain. Their polite exchange masked mutual suspicion. As sunlight illuminated the sculpted rocks, both men smiled without reaching their eyes - two players in a game where decorative facades often concealed deadly truths.
