When Zhou Jin stepped out the door, Chu Hong was already waiting outside. However, a sinister smile crept across her face.

As the two conversed, Guan Yu wore a bitter smile while speaking on the phone.

“Are you sure you’re telling the truth?” Guan Yu’s voice carried helpless amusement.

On the other end, Wang Zhen sounded near tears: “Guan Yu, you’ve got to figure something out! We can’t handle this alone!”

“Alright, I get it. I’ll think of something. I’m on my way now. If I see that bastard again, I’ll make him regret being born!”

Guan Yu angrily hung up, though his lips still twitched with a rueful grin. He hadn’t expected Wang Zhen’s news to be so absurd.

Wang Zhen had claimed—against all logic—that their art school was suddenly instituting a *cultural exam*. Guan Yu’s school had never required such tests. The mere thought of academic subjects like math made his head spin. According to Wang Zhen, failing two subjects meant immediate expulsion. No exceptions.

By the time Guan Yu drove to campus, Wang Zhen was pacing like an ant on a hot skillet. He lunged at Guan Yu’s car, wailing, “They’re trying to destroy us! Liu Gang’s behind this!”

“Calm down. Explain properly,” Guan Yu replied coolly. Unlike Wang Zhen, he didn’t fear expulsion—this school meant little to him. But Wang Zhen came from a traditional family; failing would spell disaster.

The new “quality education policy” mandated holistic development—moral, intellectual, physical, artistic, and labor education. For art students, this meant dreaded cultural exams. Worse, the tests—including advanced math—were scheduled in three days. Failure meant expulsion.

“This is bullshit!” Guan Yu snarled, lighting a cigarette. “Since when do artists need math?”

Wang Zhen, pale and trembling, accepted a smoke. “What do we do?”

Guan Yu exhaled slowly. The rushed timeline reeked of sabotage. Liu Gang, the scheming academic director, likely orchestrated this.

Back in the dorm, panicked classmates mobbed Guan Yu: “We haven’t studied math in years! Help us!”

Guan Yu raised a hand, silencing the room. “Don’t worry. No one’s failing.”

His confidence froze the chaos. But then Liu Gang’s sneering voice cut through: “Exam’s moved up to *tomorrow*. Good luck!”

**Chapter 557: The Exam**

Liu Gang personified the proverb “small men reveling in petty triumphs.” Though Guan Yu had underworld connections, Liu Gang wielded institutional power. His latest move—sudden exams—targeted Guan Yu’s allies.

“Why the change?” Guan Yu demanded, ignoring formalities.

“Academic affairs decided,” Liu Gang smirked. “Complain to the administration.”

“Or was this *your* decision?” Guan Yu’s gaze sharpened.

Liu Gang bristled. “My duty. And remember—*I’ll* proctor and grade your math exam.”

Gasps erupted. Students who’d skipped classes paled—their fate now hinged on Liu Gang’s whims.

Guan Yu studied the room. Despair hung thick. To these kids, expulsion meant shattered futures. Even Tian Hao, usually carefree, looked stricken.

“Liu Gang,” Guan Yu said softly, “get out. We need to *study*.”

The director stormed off, vowing, “Let’s see you cheat your way out!”

Once alone, Guan Yu turned to Wang Zhen. “Gather everyone. We’re strategizing.”

Wang Zhen blinked. “Cheat? Under Liu Gang’s nose?”

Guan Yu grinned. “Watch me.”

**Chapter 558: Battle Plan**

The dorm became war headquarters. Dozens crowded in, hope rekindled by Guan Yu’s audacity.

“Why’s cheating impossible?” Guan Yu challenged.

Wang Zhen listed obstacles: strict proctoring, unfamiliar content, Liu Gang’s vendetta.

Guan Yu leaned back. “Ever heard of distraction tactics? Misdirection? We’ll need lookouts, decoys, encrypted signals…”

Murmurs rippled. Someone suggested bribing teachers, but Guan Yu shook his head. “Liu Gang’s cut off those paths. We innovate.”

He outlined roles: tech-savvy students hacking the exam schedule, others creating covert communication channels. For math, they’d smuggle in formula sheets disguised as art sketches.

“But Liu Gang’s no fool,” Tian Hao worried.

Guan Yu’s eyes glinted. “Leave him to me.”

**Chapter 559: The Question of Willingness**

As plans solidified, Wang Zhen hesitated. “What if we’re caught?”

Guan Yu laughed. “Worse than expulsion? We’re artists—creativity’s our weapon.”

He met each anxious gaze. “Those willing to fight, stay. Others can leave.”

No one moved.

“Good,” Guan Yu said. “Now, let’s show Liu Gang what happens when he messes with us.”

The room buzzed with frenetic energy. Calculators were modified, shirts printed with micro-notes, shoe soles hollowed for cheat sheets. Guan Yu supervised, a general marshaling troops.

By dawn, they were ready.

Liu Gang, smug in his office, never noticed the silent rebellion brewing.
