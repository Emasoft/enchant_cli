**Chapter 1733: Complete Return**

Hayakawa Fuyuki had somehow uncovered Guan Yu’s identity. Among those present, only Hayakawa Shigeru had just realized his opponent was none other than Guan Yu, China’s foremost figure. His previously jubilant expression twisted into astonishment. Staggering backward, he gasped, “You… you’re Guan Yu? Heavens… How could I duel my own idol?!”

With his identity exposed, Guan Yu reverted to his true appearance. Hayakawa Shigeru confirmed it was indeed him and shook his head. “Though I lost, battling you was worth it.”

Eastern Island revered strength above all. Even as a foreigner, Guan Yu commanded admiration here. Hayakawa Shigeru had idolized him since childhood, and now, face-to-face, he wore the starstruck expression of a devoted fan.

Hayakawa Shigeru promptly invited Guan Yu to his home, forgetting their recent clash. However, Hayakawa Fuyuki interjected, “Mr. Guan Yu, we’d be honored to host you, but the Divine Imperial Palace has requested your presence. Please visit them first. Should you wish afterward, our humble home awaits.”

Guan Yu had intended to infiltrate the Divine Imperial Palace covertly. This invitation spared him the trouble. Bidding farewell to the Hayakawa family, he departed with Sakurako driving toward the palace.

The woman and boy who had kept their distance during the fight now approached. The boy anxiously tugged Shigeru’s hand. “Brother, did Guan Yu hurt you when he knocked you down?”

Hayakawa Fuyuki, though equally concerned, had restrained himself. Observing Shigeru’s vigor post-defeat, he wondered what Guan Yu had done.

Instead of answering, Shigeru urgently addressed his father. “Father, may I apprentice myself to Guan Yu?”

His family stared in bewilderment. Mere moments ago, they’d been rivals for Sakurako’s affection. Why this sudden reverence?

Smiling, Shigeru unleashed a surge of energy that sent leaves swirling, forcing his stepmother and brother backward.

Fuyuki’s eyes widened. “Your aura… You’ve reached first-class mutant status without enhancers? How?”

“Guan Yu channeled energy into me,” Shigeru exclaimed. “At first I feared death, but it remade my body! My strength tripled!”

Though situated in H City, the Divine Imperial Palace stood apart—a sacred oasis of tranquility. Sakurako parked half a kilometer away, and they walked toward Green Island.

Hand in hand, Sakurako maintained solemn silence, respecting the palace’s sanctity. Guan Yu noted that despite altering his appearance twice, Eastern Island’s intelligence had identified him. The televised duel likely exposed his overwhelming power over Shigeru.

Approaching the stone bridge to Green Island, an unmarked white shuttle arrived. A plain-dressed woman alighted and bowed. “Mr. Guan Yu? Miss Sakurako?”

Guan Yu nodded, sensing the unremarkable-looking pair concealed formidable strength. The man remained seated, irritation flickering at Guan Yu’s silence.

They were driven to a green-tiled building. In the foyer, Guan Yu froze—displayed were twelve weapons from the Ouyang family, the very artifacts that nearly doomed their clan.

As the attendants withdrew, a voice resonated from behind a screen: “Forgive our abrupt invitation, Mr. Guan.”

A middle-aged man in traditional robes emerged—the Divine Emperor himself. Sakurako bowed deeply; Guan Yu clasped fists in respect.

“China’s dragon among men,” the Emperor greeted. “You and Sakurako make a radiant pair.”

Gesturing to the weapons, he continued, “We commissioned these from the Ouyangs to neutralize mutants—initially targeting China. Though three were successfully tested, we return them all.”

Guan Yu’s eyes narrowed. “Your purpose?”

“Unity.” The Emperor met his gaze. “The Divine Realms appearing worldwide—we now recognize them not as blessings, but threats. Our nations must stand together against what emerges from those portals.”

Sakurako, awestruck, finally dared ask: “What’s the Divine Realm truly like?”

Guan Yu described the demonic towers, the pursuit of personal power over technology. The Emperor nodded. “Parallel worlds with differing laws. Our attacks might breach their containment—accelerating invasion.”

**Chapter 1734: Common Enemy**

As Guan Yu concluded, the Emperor proposed alliance. Sakurako wondered aloud: “Why not destroy the Realms preemptively?”

“That’s exactly what they’d want,” Guan Yu explained. “Our assaults might shatter the barriers keeping them contained.”

**Chapter 1735: Night Flight**

Later, soaring through Eastern Island’s skies, Sakurako marveled at Guan Yu’s tales of flight without machines, of warriors leveling hills with a gesture. Below, the Divine Imperial Palace’s lights dwindled—a beacon of fragile hope in gathering darkness.
