Liu Shilei froze, staring intently into Guan Yu's eyes before enunciating each word through gritted teeth: “Get lost… Stop infuriating me here!”

“Who's infuriating you! Didn't you promise me? You said yourself that no matter when, as long as I…”

“You dare continue?” When Guan Yu brought up that embarrassing matter again, Liu Shilei's face flushed crimson once more.

With a roguish grin, Guan Yu waved his hand. “Then it's settled! I'll come find you in the office after school tonight!”

“Don't you dare come! Even if you do, I won't go with you!” Liu Shilei hastily retorted. However, Guan Yu seemed not to hear as he cheerfully turned and strode out of the office.

Around two in the afternoon, Guan Yu called Feng Xin and Du Xiaojuan separately, fabricating excuses to explain he wouldn't be returning with them that evening.

Yet when explaining to Zhao Jinger, the young girl anxiously clutched his sleeve. “Brother, where are you going? Take me with you!”

Guan Yu inwardly grimaced. How could he bring her along for his romantic rendezvous with Liu Shilei? This wasn't something requiring spectators.

“It's impossible, I truly have matters to attend. Ahem… The school appointed me student council president, so… there's work to do! Don't worry, I'll return soon. You go home first.” He soothed her like a child.

Zhao Jinger nodded dejectedly, her face still etched with helplessness like an abandoned child. Watching her, Guan Yu felt a pang of guilt. But for tonight's happiness, he hardened his resolve.

After school, seeing Zhao Jinger leave campus with Du Xiaojuan, Guan Yu finally relaxed. His heart racing with anticipation, he hurried toward Liu Shilei's office.

“Professor Liu, finished work? Are you free? I need to discuss something.” Noticing other teachers present, Guan Yu adopted the manner of a model student, addressing her respectfully.

Gnashing her teeth, Liu Shilei longed to throttle this scoundrel. The audacity! She'd refused repeatedly, yet here he came chasing after her!

Restrained by colleagues, she could only glare fiercely before nodding and following him out.

The moment they exited, Liu Shilei viciously pinched Guan Yu's arm.

“Hiss…” Guan Yu theatrically jumped aside, rubbing his arm with pitiful eyes.

Despite knowing his act, Liu Shilei inexplicably felt her heart constrict. Shooting him a glare, she clicked her high heels down the stairs. “What? I said I wouldn't go. Shouldn't you be accompanying Du Xiaojuan instead of pestering me?”

Guan Yu rubbed his nose sheepishly. “Didn't we agree? To get a room together tonight.”

“Who agreed to that? Who wants to share a room with you!” Flushing crimson, Liu Shilei spun to kick him. But as she lifted her leg, Guan Yu dodged with vulgar pretense of peeking under her skirt.

“You…” Trembling with rage, she pointed at his nose. “Don't make me hit you.”

Her fierce act only amused Guan Yu. He'd learned her tells – true indifference showed icy detachment, while this mock anger signaled affectionate banter.

“Scram. Stop vexing me. I need to cook dinner.” She strode beside him, head lowered.

“Let me treat you out. Candlelit dinner followed by a wonderful night – doesn't that sound perfect? I've missed you.” He leaned closer, grinning.

“No.” Her cheeks burned.

“Truly no?” Guan Yu adopted a wounded puppy expression.

Liu Shilei felt utterly defeated. How could a grown man weaponize vulnerability so effectively? Was this rascal her natural nemesis?

“No… Go home.” She averted her eyes.

Silently, Guan Yu accompanied her toward faculty housing.

“Why still follow me?” His silence unnerved her. Why this sudden concern for his mood? Since when had she prioritized this rogue's feelings?

As turmoil clouded her thoughts, Guan Yu grasped her arm solemnly. “Shilei-jie, I must speak my heart. I love you. My conscience torments me – even sharing Du Xiaojuan's bed, I've refrained from crossing the line, fearing to lose you. If mere physical desire drove me, things would be simpler.”

He smiled bitterly. “You deserve a man wholly devoted to you. Binding you through past mistakes is unfair. Our age gap and status differences make you doubt my sincerity…” Sighing, he met her gaze mournfully. “I need space. Goodbye, Shilei-jie.”

As he turned decisively, Liu Shilei stood frozen. Was he abandoning her? Icy dread flooded her veins. Agonizing loss pierced her heart like a blade.

Tears blurred her vision as his figure receded. “Guan Yu… you scoundrel, come back!” Her trembling voice echoed across the courtyard.

Guan Yu spun back, bewildered. Nearby students gaped at the weeping professor.

Rushing to her side, he murmured, “I'm here. Don't cry.”

“Go then! Leave me to die of heartache! You have your young, beautiful Du Xiaojuan, why…”

“Nonsense!” He cut off her ramblings.

Sniffling, Liu Shilei pinched his arm. “You spout your piece then leave? Must I proclaim feelings publicly? Force me to confess first?” Her tearful glare accused him.

Chastened, Guan Yu realized his miscalculation – her refusals stemmed from shyness, not rejection. Her scolding held undertones of affection.

“Shilei-jie, shall we dine together now?” he tentatively asked.

“No!” She glared.

Stumped, Guan Yu hesitated until her laughter tinkled. “What? Storm off again? Think that'll manipulate me?”

“Never!” He grinned sheepishly.

“Silly boy…” Blushing, she conceded. “One dinner. But you must escort me back afterward. No funny business!”

As they dined, Guan Yu regaled her with humorous anecdotes, their easy banter restoring warmth.

When desserts arrived, he leaned close. “Stay with me tonight. Just talking – I swear. I crave holding you, your scent, that warmth…”

“Should I trust you?” She arched an eyebrow.

“Absolutely! I'd never force you. You're my highest priority.” His earnest vow softened her defenses.

Later, outside a boutique hotel, Liu Shilei's cheeks burned under imagined stares. A grotesque spectacle at reception halted them – a middle-aged woman, her corpulent frame squeezed into ill-fitting office wear, clinging to a mortified young man.

“Big sister, I really should go…” The youth pleaded.

“Nonsense! Room's ready.” She simpered, dragging him toward elevators.

Guan Yu approached the counter, suppressing laughter. As they completed formalities, the youth cast them desperate glances – a sacrificial lamb led to slaughter.

Chapter 300: Shattered Pelvis!

The elevator doors closed on the mismatched pair's awkward struggle. Guan Yu's room key jingled as he led Liu Shilei upstairs, both suppressing giggles at the surreal encounter.

Their mirth died upon hearing thunderous crashes from above. Rushing upstairs, they discovered the obese woman sprawled in hallway wreckage – the bed having collapsed beneath her amorous advances.

The petrified youth gaped from a corner, pants half-buttoned. Security arrived to chaos – broken furniture, howling complaints, and the woman's shrieks about "pelvic fractures."

Amidst the bedlam, Guan Yu and Liu Shilei retreated to their room, laughter erupting uncontrollably. The absurdity dissolved lingering tension, their hands naturally intertwining as the door clicked shut behind them.
