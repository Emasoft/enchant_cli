“If possible, I believe Zhenxiang (Precious Fragrance) already has the answer now,” Zhenxiang said. “From here on, we must follow my directions, whether there’s a path or not. Trust that we will find our way out.”

No one voiced any objections. Zhenxiang drew a Bagua diagram on the ground and pointed, explaining, “Calculating by orientation, I’m currently facing south. The center point is where I stand. As long as we continue in this direction, we’ll make progress.”

Wang Xiaorong (Little Lotus) frowned skeptically. “Is there any basis for this? Will it actually work? Don’t tell me this will trap us in a dead end instead. That’d be disastrous.”

“Of course there’s a basis, though explaining it now might not be easy. Even if I tried, you wouldn’t grasp it quickly. You’re clever—you’ll understand soon enough.” Zhenxiang gestured ahead. “For now, let’s focus on getting out. We can discuss the rest later.”

**Chapter 4151: Trouble Ahead**

Guan Yu pondered that regardless of who their adversary was—whether the Swordless Immortal or another—they likely wouldn’t be allowed to leave alive. Such clandestine deeds could never see the light of day.

The fact that their enemies had resorted to such underhanded tactics meant they had no intention of letting them escape.

Wang Xiaorong clung to Guan Yu’s back, eyes shut in fear. Guan Yu supported her with one arm while brandishing his Soulfall Blade with the other, slashing at the onslaught of venomous snakes.

“No wonder they say the Swordless Manor is a place from which none return,” Guan Yu muttered. “We haven’t even faced the Swordless Immortal yet. Just these endless traps, illusions, and hordes of snakes. An ordinary person would either lose their way or die from a single bite.”

“I never imagined it’d be like this. Had I known, I’d have stayed far away!” Du Teng (Soaring Eagle) grumbled, swinging his greatsword. “I thought coming here would be a turning point—a chance to elevate my cultivation. Instead, it’s this wretched, shadowy den. Pathetic, how I once idolized the Swordless Immortal.”

“We need a plan. This can’t go on. We must silence that flute,” Guan Yu urged. “Only then will the snakes stop attacking.”

Guan Yu sensed the flute’s melody was amplified by inner energy, allowing it to carry over great distances. The player was undoubtedly far from their location.

Disrupting the sound would be difficult. The stagnant air and lack of wind trapped the notes, making dissipation nearly impossible.

“Let me try!” Du Teng channeled his inner energy into his blade. With a roar, he cleaved through two peach trees, sending snakes, branches, and blossoms flying.

He hacked wildly at everything in sight—trees, snakes, whatever—but this reckless expenditure of energy played into their foes’ hands. Exhaustion would leave them vulnerable. Soon, Du Teng had cleared a patch of ground, littered with debris.

“Brother Du, stop!” Guan Yu shouted. “You’re wasting strength. We need to conserve it.” Yet the snakes kept coming, undeterred.

“If only we could use magic here,” Wang Xiaorong fumed. “I’d burn this entire forest to ash!” She stayed vigilant on Guan Yu’s back, watching for threats.

Guan Yu halted Du Teng. “This isn’t working. We must preserve our energy. To stop the snakes, we need to silence the flute’s source.”

“But how?” Du Teng panted. “The flutist is too far. Without an instrument of our own, disrupting them is impossible.”

Zhenxiang agreed. “Their inner energy mastery is extraordinary. This is no ordinary opponent.”

Suddenly, Guan Yu remembered his pistol. Its loud report might overwhelm the flute’s melody.

Without hesitation, he drew the weapon. Du Teng and Zhenxiang stared curiously as Guan宇 aimed and fired—**BANG!**

The deafening shot echoed through the trees. Three more rounds followed, startling everyone. Wang Xiaorong covered her ears.

“The flute stopped!” she cried. Indeed, the music had ceased. The remaining snakes writhed in confusion before retreating.

Guan Yu holstered the pistol. “The noise disrupted the flutist’s focus. A single misnote would undo their control—perhaps even backfire.”

Du Teng gaped. “What *was* that thing?”

“A life-saving tool. I’d rather not explain further,” Guan Yu replied politely.

Zhenxiang nodded. “We understand. Some secrets are best kept.”

**Chapter 4152: Stewed and Eaten**

With the snakes gone, the group pressed on. Du Teng’s frustration mounted with every step. The endless peach trees grated on his nerves, and he occasionally vented by chopping them down despite protests.

“We’ve walked so long, yet the scenery feels different now,” Zhenxiang observed. “My sense of direction holds.”

Guan Yu pointed at the ground. “Look—fewer petals here. The trees are sparser. We’re making progress.”

“Does that mean we’re near the edge?” Du Teng asked.

“Possibly. Or another trap. Stay alert.”

Wang Xiaorong huffed, “If those snakes return, we’ll chop them up and stew them! That’ll teach them!”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Agreed. They’d make a fine meal.”

As they walked, the trees grew taller, blossoms larger. Ahead, the forest thinned, revealing a pavilion through dissipating mist.

“We’re out!” Wang Xiaorong cheered.

Du Teng grinned. “Miraculous. We stumbled our way free.”

Their relief shattered as ten white-clad swordsmen emerged from the trees. Guan Yu glared. “Swordless Manor lackeys here to finish us?”

“You chose this path,” one retorted. “None forced you here. Those who trespass… die.”

The squad surrounded them. Outnumbered and with Wang Xiaorong and Zhenxiang unable to wield magic, Guan Yu and Du Teng stood alone.

“We came only to pay respects to the Swordless Immortal and retrieve friends,” Guan Yu said evenly. “Must you be so ruthless?”

“The Manor welcomes no guests. Trespassers meet one fate.”

**Chapter 4153: A Matter of Pride**

Zhenxiang pleaded, “Must you be so merciless? Is there no honor here?”

Guan Yu subtly signaled Wang Xiaorong. She readied her crossbow as he addressed the leader: “A renowned manor like yours wouldn’t stoop to ganging up on fewer foes, would you?”

“You have two choices: surrender or die.”

Guan Yu smirked. “Let’s play a game instead.”

Before the swordsmen reacted, Wang Xiaorong loosed a bolt. It struck a tree, the *thunk* freezing the enemies momentarily.

“You dare mock us?” the leader snarled.

“Merely testing your reflexes,” Guan Yu said. “Now, shall we negotiate?”

“There’s nothing to discuss. You—”

A second bolt whizzed past his ear. As he flinched, Guan Yu lunged, blade flashing. The dance of steel began.
