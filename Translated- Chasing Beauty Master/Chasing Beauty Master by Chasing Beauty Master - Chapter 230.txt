Guan Yu ceased his rapid-fire remarks and nodded with a smile.

Wang Zhen gave him a thumbs-up, praising, “Brilliant.”

Their cryptic exchange piqued the curiosity of two burly classmates, who craned their necks and asked, “Brother Yu, what are you two discussing?”

Still annoyed by their earlier barrage of questions, Wang Zhen cut in before Guan Yu could respond. Waving a hand with the air of a conspirator, he declared, “This is not for outsiders’ ears.”

His evasive answer only invited another round of playful ribbing.

The English exam loomed two days later. Guan Yu spent the intervening time not in classrooms but accompanying Du Xiaojuan and Zhao Jinger on shopping trips, composing passionate nocturnal symphonies with Wenqing, and occasionally pondering how to deal with the three remaining factions of Wan Qianshan in N City. Recent exam preparations for the entire class had temporarily pushed these matters aside.

Though Guan Yu paid no heed to the trio, they monitored his every move. A scheme targeting him quietly unfurled.

Two days vanished swiftly, bringing the fateful exam.

As the nation’s second language, English commanded obsessive attention from kindergarten through university. Yet despite decades of study, most students remained stranded at “How are you?” and “Nice weather,” their competence dissolving into helpless confusion beyond basic phrases.

This stark reality defined countless undergraduates. For many, English posed an insurmountable chasm.

During exams, students burned midnight oil cramming vocabulary, hoping to guess a few correct answers.

Yet Class One’s drama students remained unperturbed. Emboldened by their perfect math scores, Guan Yu and Wang Zhen now occupied near-mythic status in their peers’ eyes—masters capable of conquering any challenge.

The English exam would follow the same script: a prearranged cheating strategy awaited execution.

Students entered the exam hall with uncommon ease.

Invigilator Liu Gang observed their relaxed demeanor, confirming the tip he’d received at the café. Outwardly calm, he seethed inwardly. *Cheat? Not on my watch.*

Guan Yu expected Liu Gang’s presence but stiffened upon seeing the second invigilator—Liu Shilei.

A dilemma gripped him: cheat under his lover’s nose? If caught, her reaction was uncertain. If he abstained, what of those relying on him?

Their eyes met across the room.

Guan Yu grinned roguishly. Liu Shilei’s cheeks flushed pink—she’d lip-read his silent proposition: *After the exam, let’s book a room.*

Though their liaisons were frequent, his public flirtations still flustered her.

As one of the university’s celebrated beauties, Liu Shilei commanded every male gaze. A throat-clearing cough from Liu Gang shattered the spell.

“Prepare to begin,” he barked.

Liu Gang now embodied stoic vigilance. While lesser men might gawk at the stunning teacher, he glared at students like a wolf eying lambs. Not that he lacked desire—resentment overshadowed lust. Knowing Liu Shilei was Guan Yu’s nominal sister, he extended his hatred to her through association.

“Quit dawdling! Start the exam!” Liu Gang brandished a phone, eager to catch Guan Yu cheating and expel him.

As deputy dean, his authority cowed dissenters. All attention funneled toward Guan Yu.

Liu Gang’s hawk-like scrutiny left Liu Shilei to distribute papers. When exams commenced, the classroom’s tension thickened.

As their homeroom teacher, Liu Shilei fretted over her class’s performance. Scanning the room, she noted only Zhao Jinger and a few girls working earnestly. Others feigned concentration, slept, or glanced about—common exam behaviors, yet Guan Yu’s presence amplified her concern.

Academic failures could cost students their enrollment, tarnishing her reputation. She paced anxiously, stealing glances at Guan Yu’s blank paper.

*Why isn’t he writing anything?* She gnashed her teeth, powerless under Liu Gang’s surveillance. The deputy dean watched her as intently as the examinees, suspecting collusion.

After several circuits, she retreated to the podium.

Time crawled for both invigilators. Liu Shilei agonized over Guan Yu’s inaction; Liu Gang fidgeted, frequently checking his phone.

Half an hour in, Liu Gang’s eyes lit up—his informant’s prediction unfolded.

Guan Yu shifted posture, scribbling rapidly as in the math exam. Liu Gang’s jaw tightened. Last time, this tactic had left him nursing bruised genitals and a disciplinary mark.

Circulating the room, Liu Gang inspected papers with feigned concern. His inner glee swelled seeing mostly blank sheets—students awaited Guan Yu’s answers.

*The higher their trust, the greater their fall,* he gloated, flashing Guan Yu a挑衅 look.

With forty minutes remaining, tension peaked. Liu Gang patrolled like a specter, materializing instantly at any suspicious movement.

“You! And you!” His sudden roar startled pencils from grips. “Stop fidgeting!”

A cowed student retracted his neck, abandoning attempts to peek at a neighbor’s answers. Others reconsidered similar plans—Liu Gang’s hawk eyes missed nothing.

Yet during this commotion, Guan Yu flicked folded notes to nearby peers. Grins spread as recipients covertly copied answers.

Liu Gang spotted the paper trails but hesitated. His informant had warned this was bait—confronting cheaters risked another groin-kicking ambience, especially with female students involved.

Clenching his jaw, Liu Gang played oblivious.

**Chapter Five Hundred and Seventy-Five: Baiting the Trap**

Liu Gang now embodied ethereal vigilance, materializing wherever whispers stirred. Students sweated as the clock ticked and Guan Yu remained inert.

When bold souls risked cheating, Liu Gang’s threats crumbled before a wealthy student’s counter-threats. This emboldened others briefly, until Liu Gang’s omniscient gaze reasserted control.

All hopes now rested on Guan Yu.

True to his reputation, Guan Yu unleashed a flurry of notes in Liu Gang’s distracted moment. Recipients muffled excited gasps, scribbling answers like thieves counting loot.

Liu Gang glimpsed the white projectiles but stayed rooted. His informant’s warning echoed: *Blank papers. A trap to make you assault students.*

Smirking inwardly, he avoided eye contact with his mole—a betrayer in Guan Yu’s ranks.

The notes’ temptation raged against his restraint. Like a monk resisting succubi, Liu Gang maintained his facade.

On the podium, Liu Shilei’s eyelid twitched as paper birds soared from Guan Yu’s desk. Her heartbeat thundered, torn between professional duty and personal stakes.

The exam’s final act had begun.
