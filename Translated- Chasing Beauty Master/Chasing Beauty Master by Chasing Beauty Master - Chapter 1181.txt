A searing pain erupted from his nose, and the agony of the two kicks he’d suffered earlier surged through his body. Old Man Li lay sprawled on the ground, his face ashen, hands clutching his bloodied nose as he wailed pitifully.

**Chapter 3027: Beware**

The onlookers stared in stunned disbelief. None could believe what they were witnessing—the venerable patriarch of the Li family, reduced to such a wretched state by an outsider! It defied all reason.

The Li family’s prestige crumbled in the eyes of the crowd, their reputation severely tarnished. Only now did everyone realize that the Li family’s vaunted power had been mostly a facade, a hollow display of bluster.

Guanyu flexed his fist, grimacing. Old Man Li’s nasal bone had been surprisingly tough, leaving his hand numb. “Old Li,” Guanyu said coldly, “out of respect for Qiaoqiao, I’ll let you off today. Take your wretched self and scram. I can’t stand the sight of you.”

The Lin family had initially intended to stay neutral, but Guanyu’s mention of “respect for Lin Qiaoqiao” had dragged them into the fray. Though battered and humiliated, Old Man Li seethed with rage. Not only had his dignity been shattered, but the Lin family’s standing in the town would suffer as well. The thought of being bested by a brash youth was intolerable.

Worse yet, both father and son had been humiliated in succession. How could he swallow such an insult? Clenching his teeth, Old Man Li watched Guanyu’s every move, plotting revenge.

Guanyu loomed over him, voice icy. “I’ve already sent men to investigate. Within two days, every disgraceful deed you and your son have committed will be exposed. Go home and wait for the news. We’ll see how long you can keep up your act.” With that, he turned toward Lin Qiaoqiao.

As Guanyu walked away, Old Man Li’s fingers twitched, revealing three poisoned needles. Ignoring his injuries, he flung them at Guanyu’s retreating back.

Lin Zhonggeng and others caught the treacherous act. “Guanyu! Behind you!” Lin Zhonggeng shouted.

Guanyu reacted instantly. Though exhausted from the fight, he twisted sideways, drawing a small dagger from his belt. But the distance was too close—barely five meters. Depleted as he was, he couldn’t evade the needles in time.

“Guanyu! Look out!” Lin Qiaoqiao screamed. The crowd held their breath, certain he was doomed. Lin Qiaoqiao shut her eyes, unable to watch.

Just as the needles neared Guanyu’s back—less than two centimeters away—a crimson light flared before him.

*Whoosh!* The needles ricocheted back toward Old Man Li. No one understood what had happened.

“Ugh—!” Old Man Li grunted as his own poisoned needles pierced his flesh. His pallid face turned ghastly green—the toxins were potent.

While bystanders assumed Guanyu had some protective artifact, only he knew the red light had come from Zuiyuxiaolang.

Old Man Li frantically tore at his clothes, searching for the antidote. Without it, he’d be dead within minutes. His underhanded attack had destroyed the Li family’s last shred of dignity, their reputation now in ruins.

“Only cowards and scum attack from behind with poisoned weapons,” Guanyu spat. “You’re truly despicable.”

Old Man Li, too weakened to retort, swallowed the antidote and began channeling his energy to heal.

Lin Qiaoqiao rushed to Guanyu’s side. “Are you hurt?!”

“I’m fine,” Guanyu assured her, though his drenched clothes betrayed his exhaustion. Lin Qiaoqiao glared at Old Man Li’s pitiful form—any sympathy erased by his treachery.

“Uncle Li,” she chided, “losing a fight is one thing, but resorting to poison? If anything had happened to Guanyu, your entire family would’ve paid!” Her threat wasn’t empty—Yang Congshan alone could erase the Li family from existence.

As Old Man Li focused on purging the toxins, Lin Qiaoqiao noticed Guanyu’s trembling, sweat-soaked hands. “Let’s get you somewhere to rest,” she insisted, leading him toward the rear courtyard.

Tomorrow’s martial arts tournament for marriage demanded Guanyu’s full strength—Lin Qiaoqiao’s future depended on it.

**Chapter 3028: Reluctance**

The Lakeside Garden, usually reserved for Lin women, bloomed with vibrant flowers. Guanyu recognized some medicinal herbs, sparking a playful debate with Lin Qiaoqiao about flora.

“Qiaoqiao,” Lin Zhonggeng’s voice interrupted, “this is no place for a man. What will people say?”

“Dad!” she protested. “These outdated rules need to die! Let him rest here—he’s exhausted.”

Lin Zhonggeng sighed. The Li family’s disgrace had spread, but protocol mattered. “Our guests have proper quarters. Why bring him here?”

“He’ll move to the east wing later,” Lin Qiaoqiao insisted. “Just let him recover first.”

As her father left reluctantly, Lin Qiaoqiao’s unspoken feelings for Guanyu hung in the air. The Li family’s reputation might’ve collapsed, but tomorrow’s challenges loomed larger.

**Chapter 3029: Tomorrow’s Concerns**

Lin Zhonggeng returned with pressing questions. “Why didn’t you use inner qi tonight? You’re exhausting yourself!”

Guanyu fabricated an excuse about cultivation refinement. Though skeptical, Lin Zhonggeng dropped the matter—for now.

“What about tomorrow?” Lin Qiaoqiao pressed. “You have to win!”

“I’ll manage,” Guanyu hedged. Without inner qi, continuous battles would drain him. The Wang family’s prodigy—a nineteen-year-old Second-Class Adept—posed the greatest threat.

Lin Qiaoqiao proposed spacing out the matches, but tradition demanded non-stop challenges. Guanyu’s plan: wait until the final opponent emerged before striking.

As dawn approached, the Lin residence buzzed with activity. Firecrackers lined the tournament grounds, copper basins of red-dyed water arranged ceremoniously below the stage.

“What are those for?” Guanyu asked, pointing.

Lin Qiaoqiao shrugged, her mind elsewhere. Tomorrow would test more than martial skill—it would decide her fate.
