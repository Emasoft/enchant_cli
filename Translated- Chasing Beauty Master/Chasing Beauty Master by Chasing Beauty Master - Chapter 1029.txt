Guan Yu reacted the fastest, quickly stepping forward to help up Jin Ci Yu Lang (Second Only to Wolf), feigning concern as he said, “Ah, Brother Jin Ci, how could you be so careless? Hurry and get up—did you hurt yourself? I still need your help later. If you’re injured, what will I do?”

Jin Ci Yu Lang stood up, brushed off the dust from his clothes, and replied calmly, “It’s nothing. Just slipped a little. No big deal. What was that last thing you said? I didn’t quite catch it.”

Guan Yu’s heart sank. *Damn it. I didn’t expect him to hold a grudge. He’s obviously probing about me asking for his help.*

But Guan Yu didn’t elaborate. Even if he did, Jin Ci Yu Lang would surely mock him. After a brief pause, Guan Yu said, “Hmm? Which part?”

“The last sentence. What did you say?” Jin Ci Yu Lang pressed again, his expression oddly intense as he stared at Guan Yu.

“Oh, I said, ‘If you’re injured, what will I do?’”

“Not that. The one before.” Jin Ci Yu Lang persisted.

“Oh? The one before?” Guan Yu pretended to think hard. “What was it again? I’ve honestly forgotten. Anyway, it wasn’t important. Let it go.”

Guan Yu shrugged dismissively, but Jin Ci Yu Lang wasn’t about to let him off. With a sly grin, he said, “Heh. Fine. Since I’ve already seen Sakurako today, I’ll take my leave if there’s nothing else. Don’t want to bother you two. Bye.”

He waved and turned to leave. Sakurako stood nearby, unsure how to intervene.

To Guan Yu’s surprise, Jin Ci Yu Lang had played this card. Reluctantly, Guan Yu conceded defeat. “Alright, come inside and sit. I’ll need your help soon. Quit being so petty. I swear, you and Sakurako can’t possibly be siblings—she’s so much more generous!”

At this, Jin Ci Yu Lang turned back, visibly irritated. “Nonsense! When Sakurako came here, she took all my money to give to you! You ask me for favors but won’t spare a single penny! Do you think food, drink, and living expenses grow on trees? You’re stingy enough, but you won’t even let me win an argument? Hmph!”

Guan Yu scratched his ear, looking exasperated. “Whether Sakurako took your money or not, that’s between you two. She’s the one who took it, not me. Right, Sakurako?”

He tossed the question to Sakurako, who naturally sided with Guan Yu. She glared at Jin Ci Yu Lang. “You’re making such a fuss over a tiny favor! Asking Guan Yu for money is the same as asking me! Besides, do you even need money? *Do you?* ***Do you?***”

Guan Yu stifled a laugh. *She really said the important thing three times.*

Sakurako continued, “If you claim you’re broke, you’re lying. You’d just gamble it all away. I’m saving it for your future wife—since you still haven’t found one!”

When Sakurako erupted, Jin Ci Yu Lang didn’t dare utter a peep. To him, she might as well be a goddess.

“Alright, alright! I was just joking! No need to take it so seriously…” Jin Ci Yu Lang chuckled nervously, heading into the house to change the subject.

Upon entering the grand hall, Jin Ci Yu Lang was struck by its immaculate cleanliness—far surpassing even the most luxurious hotel suites he’d visited.

The spacious hall gleamed under pristine white tiles, casting a radiant brightness. The unwritten rule here was clear: shoes had to be removed.

But Jin Ci Yu Lang, having gone days without proper sleep during his search for Yingshangu, knew removing his shoes would unleash a foot odor of apocalyptic proportions.

With a mischievous grin, he yanked off his shoes, revealing thick black socks, and marched toward the sofa, leaving a trail of footprints.

Guan Yu noticed but bit his tongue, removing his own shoes and carefully avoiding the polluted path. Sakurako hesitated at the door, deciding to clean up later rather than embarrass her brother.

Jin Ci Yu Lang plopped onto the snow-white sofa, grabbed a pear from the table, and took a juicy bite. “Mmm, sweet! Good stuff!”

Guan Yu forced a smile. “Glad you like it. Help yourself to more. We’ve plenty.” As he sat nearby, a pungent stench assaulted his nostrils.

*God, that’s lethal!* Guan Yu inwardly cursed. Noticing his discomfort, Jin Ci Yu Lang smugly propped his feet on the table, wiggling his socked toes.

The hall soon filled with a nauseating reek. Jin Ci Yu Lang munched his pear contentedly while Guan Yu, barely breathing, stood abruptly.

“You two relax. I’ve… something to check upstairs.” He bolted to his room, gasping for fresh air.

Left alone with her brother, Sakurako pinched her nose. “Wash your feet! The bathroom’s right there! I’m suffocating!”

Jin Ci Yu Lang roared with laughter. “Smell? I thought it was a lingering fart!”

**Chapter 2632: Stubborn Minds**

As Sakurako shoved him toward the bathroom, Lv Mei emerged from a bedroom upstairs. “A-Mei, I’m hungr—*what is that stench?!*”

The sleep-deprived woman froze, horrified by the filthy footprints and stench. Her scream summoned the entire household—Zhang Han, Lan Yu, A-Mei, and Xue Jing—all recoiling at the odor.

“THIEF!” Zhang Han shrieked upon spotting Jin Ci Yu Lang, nearly fainting from the stench. Xue Jing quickly clarified, “It’s Brother Jin Ci! Guan Yu’s friend!”

The women fled to their rooms, leaving Xue Jing to endure the smell politely. Sakurako apologized profusely while her brother finally scrubbed his feet.

When Guan Yu returned downstairs, he found Xue Jing insisting on joining his mission. “You’re staying,” he said firmly. “I need you to replace the sofa cushions he ruined. And buy snacks for Zhang Han.”

Though reluctant, Xue Jing relented after Guan Yu promised hourly updates. As Jin Ci Yu Lang emerged with bleached feet, Guan Yu nodded toward the door. “Let’s go. Yingshangu won’t find herself.”

The hall’s windows stood wide open, a lingering reminder of the chaos—and the price of unwashed feet.
