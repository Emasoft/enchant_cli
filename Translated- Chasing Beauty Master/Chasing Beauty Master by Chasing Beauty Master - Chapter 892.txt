“You’re despicable!” Chen Xiaona spat angrily. As a woman, how could she allow a man to grope her freely? Guan Yu’s demand was clearly a ploy to avoid untying her, prompting her furious retort.

Guan Yu chuckled, having anticipated her refusal. “Do you truly believe I harbor ulterior motives? If you’re unwilling, we’ll simply continue our discussion as we are.”

Time was ticking. Jin Hua, who had been lurking behind Guan Yu with a sly smile, awaited the onset of Chen Xiaona’s poisoning—the water she’d earlier offered had been laced with toxins.

**Chapter 2286: The Mysterious Master**

Chen Xiaona seethed in silence, regretting her decision to confront Ah Cai alone. She’d underestimated Guan Yu, assuming him to be nothing more than a tourist entangled with a rebellious youth. Human trafficking rings often targeted such couples, viewing them as easy prey without connections or competence. She’d envisioned this mission as a straightforward path to promotion and rewards within her organization.

Yet Guan Yu had proven infuriatingly cunning, toying with her hopes and despair until her resolve crumbled. “Do as you please,” she declared coldly. “I won’t speak another word. Kill me if you wish.”

Guan Yu shrugged. “Since you refuse to cooperate, I’ll untie you anyway. Let’s hope you behave.” Just as Chen Xiaona closed her eyes, resigned to death, his words reignited a flicker of hope.

But the moment his fingers brushed the ropes, he paused and turned to Ah Cai. “Feeling better? Let me help you up.” He guided the weakened youth to the sofa, examining his self-inflicted wounds. “These’ll need Jin Hua’s salves to heal properly. We can’t have you scarring like a monster.”

Abandoned once more, Chen Xiaona writhed against her restraints. Numbness crept through her limbs—prolonged bondage was stifling her circulation. If paralysis set in, escape would be impossible. She needed to act.

“Fine!” she blurted. “Search me, then untie me!”

Guan Yu arched a brow. “Patience. Let me settle Ah Cai first.”

Panic surged. “Ask your questions!” she snapped, willing to lie if necessary.

“Where’s your organization’s hideout here?”

“Ka Street, opposite the McDonald’s,” she lied swiftly.

Lai Li snorted. “That’s a police station. Try harder.”

Chen Xiaona cursed inwardly—she’d forgotten Lai Li’s local knowledge. “A slip of the tongue! I’ll tell the truth now!”

Guan Yu’s smile sharpened. “Lying again? Perhaps you enjoy the floor.”

**Chapter 2287: Sister-in-Law**

Jin Hua preened as Ah Cai addressed her as “Sister-in-Law,” a title she’d long coveted. “Such a thoughtful boy! I’ll prepare the finest ointments. No need to suffer.”

Ah Cai paled, distrusting her sudden kindness. “I-I’ll manage…”

Guan Yu intervened. “Enough teasing. You’re scaring him.”

Chen Xiaona, ignored and desperate, strained against her bonds. Her body grew heavier—the poison’s grip was tightening. She had one goal left: destroy the police station to avenge her late lover. Two years of planning, now jeopardized by Guan Yu’s meddling.

“Untie me!” she pleaded, her voice fraying. “I’ll answer anything!”

Guan Yu crouched before her. “Your hideout’s real location?”

“I… It’s…” She faltered, torn between survival and betrayal.

He leaned closer, voice velvet menace. “Tick-tock. The toxin won’t wait forever.”

**Chapter 2288: Numbed Mind**

Chen Xiaona’s vision blurred. The room swayed—thoughts dissolving into fog. Guan Yu’s face loomed, merciless and amused. “Last chance.”

“East… East Riverside Warehouse,” she slurred, consciousness slipping.

As darkness claimed her, Jin Hua giggled. “Took her long enough.”

Guan Yu stood, brushing dust from his sleeves. “Prep the van. We’ll raid them at dawn.”

The game was far from over.
