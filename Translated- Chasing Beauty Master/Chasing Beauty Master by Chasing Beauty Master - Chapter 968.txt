“Just as the car turned the corner ahead, it suddenly screeched to a halt. Jia Bo, who had been bent over calculating accounts, slammed his head against the windshield. He immediately cursed, ‘Damn it! Can’t you drive for shit? Trying to kill me?!’

The driver, aggrieved by the scolding, pointed ahead. ‘Brother Jia, it’s not my fault. The road’s blocked.’

Jia Bo finally looked up. Four vehicles were parked horizontally across the road, completely sealing it off. Over twenty burly men stood in front of the cars, the front few holding shotguns while others behind carried rifles.

‘What the hell is this?’ Jia Bo’s mind went blank. With so many guns in their hands, things looked dire.

Guan Yu steered his car to the front of the convoy and surveyed the scene. ‘Jingjing,’ he said calmly, ‘seems our troubles aren’t over today. These guys were probably sent by Shen Fangcheng. That bastard just won’t give up.’

**Chapter 2,475: Reckless**

Xue Jing nodded, though worry gnawed at her. With Guan Yu’s cultivation gone and so many guns pointed their way, the danger was extreme. ‘Let me go check. Stay in the car,’ she urged.

‘No way,’ Guan Yu retorted, stepping out. ‘How can we rely on a woman to handle this?’ Xue Jing hurriedly followed.

Seeing Guan Yu exit, the brothers from other cars rushed out too, crowding behind him and Xue Jing.

Bolstered by Guan Yu’s presence, Jia Bo roared at the opposition, ‘Did your mother never teach you that a good dog doesn’t block the road?!’

His men jeered and hurled insults, their hundred-strong crowd creating an imposing spectacle.

**BANG!** A deafening gunshot rang out as Ah Xiong, the opposition’s leader, fired his shotgun skyward, silencing the Yu Gang members.

‘Shut your fucking mouths!’ Ah Xiong barked. ‘I’m only here for Guan Yu today. Cowards, scram!’

Guan Yu coldly assessed the scene. These weren’t ordinary thugs—if provoked further, they might actually shoot. He couldn’t risk his brothers’ lives.

Stepping forward, Guan Yu declared, ‘I’m Guan Yu. What do you want?’

Ah Xiong sneered, surprised his target was a student. ‘Our boss wants to see you. Come quietly, or my gun might... slip.’

Jia Bo, eager to prove himself, shoved in front of Guan Yu. ‘Your boss can eat shit! Think guns scare us? Go ahead—shoot me!’

Ah Xiong’s face twisted. These brats, unfazed by firearms, were even cockier than him. Reckless outlaws.

He aimed his gun at Jia Bo as his men followed suit. ‘Last warning! I only want Guan Yu. The rest of you maggots—disappear!’

Contrary to expectations, not a single Yu Gang member fled. Guan Yu stood like an unshakable mountain, his calm radiating through the ranks. Though confident in their leader, Guan Yu himself felt uneasy. Pulling Jia Bo back, he advanced alone.

Xue Jing rushed forward. ‘Guan Yu, don’t!’

Ah Xiong’s eyes lit up at her voice. Even masked, her figure and eyes betrayed striking beauty. ‘Guan Yu!’ he barked. ‘Come now, or blood spills today!’

Ignoring Xue Jing’s plea, Guan Yu smirked. ‘Am I that popular? Another boss wants me? Let me guess—Shen Fangcheng’s friend? Care to name your leader?’

‘Enough talk!’ Ah Xiong snapped. ‘Come quietly unless you want corpses here.’

‘Screw you!’ someone shouted from the crowd. The Yu Gang erupted in chaos.

Guan Yu turned, moved by their loyalty. But reason prevailed—too many guns to fight head-on. Raising his hands, he quieted the crowd. ‘Their boss wants a chat. I’ll go. Wait for my return.’

As Guan Yu strode forward, Xue Jing called, ‘Husband! Wait for me! I want to see this spectacle too!’

Guan Yu glanced at Ah Xiong. ‘Mind if I bring my darling?’

Ah Xiong leered. ‘Fine.’ This way, he’d kill Guan Yu en route and keep the beauty.

Handcuffs appeared. As a thug grabbed Guan Yu’s wrist, he twisted the man’s arm, drew a Desert Eagle, and shot his leg. **BANG!**

Chaos erupted. Ah Xiong raised his gun—but Xue Jing kicked him viciously in the groin. Two more shots rang out as Guan Yu disabled others.

Xue Jing dragged the writhing Ah Xiong up, pressing a Black Star pistol to his temple. ‘Drop your guns, or I paint the road with his brains!’

Terrified, Ah Xiong screamed, ‘Do it! Drop them!’

Disarmed, the thugs were overwhelmed as Yu Gang members seized weapons and beat them down. Begging for mercy, the attackers were stripped naked per Jia Bo’s suggestion—‘Let them shame-walk home!’

Xue Jing hid her face against Guan Yu. ‘What a vulgar idea!’

Amid laughter, Jia Bo scolded a brother for complimenting Xue Jing’s fighting grace. ‘Respect our madam!’

Clearing the road, Guan Yu ordered the blockade cars smashed. ‘Now,’ he said, ‘let’s visit this Boss Kong.’

Xue Jing protested, but the men roared approval. Using captured thugs as guides, the convoy rolled out.

**Chapter 2,476: Feed Them to the Fish**

Meanwhile, Boss Kong lounged in his garden, two beauties massaging his legs. A bank alert chimed—1 million yuan from Shen Fangcheng.

‘Punctual old fool,’ Kong chuckled.

‘Congratulations, sir!’ a woman cooed.

‘Rewards for all!’ Kong promised, envisioning Guan Yu’s demise. Unaware his men had fallen, he basked in false security—soon shattered by approaching engines...
