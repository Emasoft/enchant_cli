The Eight-Sided Drum Technique was something Guan Yu had personally experienced; it was undoubtedly real, not mere fabrication. Moreover, those emblematic phrases had been discovered by Guan Yu and Wang Xiaorong in the underground palace of Patriarch Menghua. This couldn't be wrong—it definitely wasn't a lie concocted by the Demon Soul Sect.

Lord Zhuang Lu, however, stubbornly insisted this was false information spread by the Demon Soul Sect with ulterior motives. He even claimed the Eight-Sided Drum Technique either didn't exist or wasn't as formidable as legends suggested. Such views from Lord Lu were perplexing.

Xiao Zhi added, “Lord Lu, they say the Demon Lord has sent five to six hundred troops as vanguard. Shouldn't Tiger Mouth Fortress be secure?”

Yan Zhao grew visibly displeased at Xiao Zhi's remark. He hadn't expected Xiao Zhi to speak so carelessly. Not only was this potentially leaking military intelligence, but if the information proved false, they might fall into the enemy's trap. Moreover, Yan Zhao remained under the Demon Soul Sect's control—such words shouldn't be uttered recklessly.

The Demon Soul Sect had already set up camp five li outside Tiger Mouth Fortress. From the western battlements, one could clearly see rows of tents stretching into the distance. Within days, the sect would likely launch its assault.

Lord Lu stood silently on the ramparts, gazing into the distance. Only he knew the thoughts churning in his mind. Even his most trusted subordinates couldn't fathom what preoccupied him daily.

For this campaign, both the Left and Right Envoys of the Demon Soul Sect had mobilized. The Demon Lord had invested heavily in destroying Tiger Mouth Fortress, determined to raze Lu Manor to the ground to quell his burning hatred.

In the Demon Soul Sect's camp, Wang Xiaorong sat bored on the ground. After some contemplation, she resolved to enter the city and check on Guan Yu's injuries. She couldn't rest until she confirmed his condition.

“Halt, Young Mistress! Where are you going?” The Right Envoy's voice rang out behind her, freezing Wang Xiaorong in her tracks.

“Young Mistress, I know you intend to find that boy Guan Yu in the city,” the Right Envoy approached, her voice calm yet firm.

The Right Envoy appeared to be a woman in her thirties, though her true age remained unknown after decades of cultivation. She perpetually wore a veil, never revealing her face.

Rumors within the Demon Soul Sect suggested an intimate relationship between the Right Envoy and the Demon Lord, possibly longstanding lovers. Those who dared voice such speculations had been executed by the Right Envoy's palm strikes. Now only the boldest whispered about it in secret.

As one of the Demon Lord's earliest followers, the Right Envoy had stood by him through the sect's internal schisms. Both Envoys held positions equivalent to vice-leaders, only deployed for critical missions.

Wang Xiaorong pleaded, “Sister Right Envoy, please let me go. I'm suffocating here!”

“No. You promised obedience as condition for joining this campaign. Disobey, and I'll have you escorted back immediately.” The Right Envoy's tone brooked no argument. “Moreover, Tiger Mouth Fortress gates remain sealed under heavy guard. If your identity is discovered, you'll endanger yourself and jeopardize our plans.”

Defeated, Wang Xiaorong asked, “When can I see Guan Yu? We've camped here days without action!”

“We await the opportune moment,” the Right Envoy explained. “The Left Envoy has infiltrated Lu Manor. When he signals, and my fifty-man Thunderflame Phoenix formation completes preparation, this insignificant fortress will be reduced to ashes.”

“But Guan Yu's still inside! Your Thunderflame Phoenix is lethal—what if his injuries prevent escape?” Wang Xiaorong cried in alarm.

She knew the Right Envoy's prowess with formation-enhanced spells. The hundred-strong unit personally trained by the envoy could amplify spell potency manifold through coordinated arrays—a force even the Demon Lord couldn't command.

“Fear not. The phoenix's flames will mainly destroy buildings and commoners. Any cultivator with sense can evade them unless they stand idle in the fire.” The Right Envoy turned away. “You stay here. Not one step beyond camp.”

Wang Xiaorong stuck her tongue out at the retreating figure. While she dared act coy with the Demon Lord and Left Envoy, some innate dread prevented such behavior toward the stern Right Envoy, despite never witnessing her rage.

Chapter 3764: All for Your Own Good

Descending the western ramparts, Guan Yu's group walked through streets as Yan Zhao berated Xiao Zhi: “Why mention the Demon Soul Sect's troop numbers this morning? Since when do we share enemy intelligence?”

“I thought Lord Lu should know!” Xiao Zhi protested.

“Fool! Consider the consequences! If it's disinformation causing defeat, you'll bear responsibility!” Guan Yu nodded agreement—speculation without proof was reckless.

Head bowed, Xiao Zhi muttered, “My mistake. I'll be more careful.”

“Remember—this isn't Cloud Azure Sect where Elder Zheng protects you. Heed my advice for your own good.” Yan Zhao's scolding carried paternal sternness.

That evening's reception occurred not in the banquet hall but a smaller parlor. Lord Lu presided over three low tables bearing local delicacies.

“Honored heroes, try these desert specialties. Though humble, they fortify the body.” Servants poured wine as Yan Zhao sampled a crispy petal dish. “Exquisite! What's this?”

Lord Lu smiled. “Sand Sweat Blossoms—they thrive in arid conditions, exuding toxic dewdrops when sun-baked. We detoxify them through frying. Harmless and nutritious when prepared properly.”

Yan Zhao's chewing slowed imperceptibly. Though reassured, he avoided further helpings.

Chapter 3765: Ambush

When Lord Lu called for his medicinal wine, a servant entered carrying a jar. Yan Zhao stiffened—the man's bracelet identified him as the Left Envoy!

Xiao Zhi shouted warning as the impostor hurled the jar. Lord Lu dodged but took two palm strikes to the chest, crashing through a screen. As Guan Yu and Xiao Zhi joined the fray, Yan Zhao deliberately took a feigned blow, allowing the Left Envoy's escape.

Later in the study, Lord Lu—pale but alive—thanked Xiao Zhi: “Your vigilance saved me. The Left Envoy's appearance signals imminent attack.”

As they spoke, a guard burst in: “My lord! The Demon Soul Sect advances on western gates!”
