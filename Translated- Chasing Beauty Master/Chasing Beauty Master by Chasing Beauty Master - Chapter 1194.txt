At this moment, they could not send Second Only to Wolf to snatch them back. If there were only one person, it might be possible, but now over twenty armed men held more than a dozen hostages. Eliminating them all in an instant was utterly impossible.

If Second Only to Wolf acted recklessly, the enemy might slit the throats of the Lin family’s women in desperation.

Under these circumstances, Guan Yu had no choice but to yield. He said, “Li Gui, tell your men not to act rashly. Let’s discuss this calmly. There’s no need for such theatrics.”

“Guan Yu!” Li Gui roared furiously. “The Li family’s downfall is entirely your doing! When I raided the Lin residence, I couldn’t find Lin Qiaoqiao. Otherwise, I’d have dragged her here and ruined her before your eyes—just to watch you choke on your rage!”

“Anger harms the body. Why torment yourself so?” Guan Yu replied. “You’ve returned today to save your family. I’ll give you that chance. Release the Lin family’s women. They’re innocent and have no part in this feud.”

Despite Guan Yu’s earnest persuasion, Li Gui’s hatred burned too fiercely. Refusing to engage further, he turned to Lin Zhonggeng. “Lin Zhonggeng! You have five minutes to free my family. Once they’re safe, I’ll release your kin. Otherwise, we all perish here today!”

With no alternatives, Guan Yu nodded at Lin Zhonggeng. They had to comply. Li Gui had returned with suicidal resolve, and provoking him risked catastrophe.

Even capturing Li Gui now would prove futile. The man clearly expected to die, but dragging the Lin family’s women to the grave alongside his own kin would satisfy his vengeance. Killing him would only harden his men’s resolve to slaughter the hostages.

Lin Zhonggeng turned helplessly to the old physician, who grimaced. “We cannot let the Lin family perish as collateral.”

“Very well,” the old physician declared. “Release the Li family first.” With a wave, Lin’s subordinates untied the Li captives in the execution grounds.

Old Master Li, weakened by days of starvation and lingering poison, could barely walk. His once-formidable inner energy had evaporated.

“Son… you’ve done well,” he wheezed. “Let us leave at once.”

Li Gui surveyed his father’s haggard state. “Father, we’ll depart shortly. Not a single Li shall remain here. If this town rejects us, another sanctuary awaits. Our family will thrive elsewhere.”

Guan Yu observed silently. Whatever Li Gui’s flaws, his daring to risk death for his kin commanded grudging respect. A coward would have fled, yet here he stood.

At least the man had spine. Old Master Li’s eyes glistened with pride—his son had proven worthy.

“Let us hurry!” the old man urged, desperate to flee the pyre’s shadow.

“Wait,” Li Gui interjected. Raising his voice, he called to Guan Yu: “They say you’re a man of honor. Release my family, and I’ll free the Lin women. But you’ll take their place as hostage. Fear not—once we’re beyond the town, you go free.”

“Gladly,” Guan Yu agreed, having anticipated this. With only himself as hostage, Second Only to Wolf could intervene.

The bodyguard objected fiercely: “This is too dangerous! They’re all cultivators. One misstep—”

“Trust me,” Guan Yu insisted. “Li Gui needs me alive until his family escapes. Your moment will come.”

Reluctantly, Second Only to Wolf acquiesced.

Lin Zhonggeng approached, gratitude etched on his face. “You risk much for my family. Take care.”

As Li’s men bound Guan Yu with thick ropes, he remained placid. “Release them now,” he demanded once trussed.

Li Gui nodded. His men freed the Lin women, who flocked to Lin Zhonggeng like frightened chicks.

“Move out!” Li Gui barked. His entourage shuffled forward, Guan Yu hoisted on two men’s shoulders with a blade at his throat.

Old Master Li whispered, “What of Guan Yu?”

“He dies once we reach Uncle Zhang San’s territory,” Li Gui hissed. “Our insurance policy.”

The group hurried toward the town’s eastern edge where horses awaited. But as they rounded a corner, a scream erupted behind them.

Second Only to Wolf struck like lightning, severing the rope around Guan Yu and dispatching the guards. Chaos erupted as Lin’s forces ambushed from the front.

“Charge!” Li Gui rallied, but hope died as Lin Qiaoqiao appeared with reinforcements. The escape route collapsed.

In the fray, Second Only to Wolf carved through Li’s cultivators with surgical precision, disabling without killing. Guan Yu guarded the rear, intercepting fugitives.

Cornered, Li Gui’s defiance crumbled. His borrowed army faltered against Lin’s resolve. The Li clan’s desperate bid for freedom dissolved into clashing steel and fading shouts—their dreams of vengeance trampled beneath the town’s unyielding justice.
