Staring incredulously at his hands, Guan Yu felt dazed. Had it all been a dream? Yet the experience felt unbearably vivid. As his mind swam, he suddenly recalled the Body Sculpting Serpent Flower – that accursed plant must have caused the recent events! Immediately, he began scouring every corner of the room, but found no trace of the mystical herb.

"Could all of this be a dream? This... this defies reason. Some mutation must have occurred when I died, allowing this miraculous resurrection." Clearly disbelieving the dream theory, Guan Yu muttered to himself.

"Enough. Though the mutation's nature eludes me, it seems beneficial. Now I must focus on rapid cultivation. Only through strength can I escape this cycle of humiliation!" Renewed determination flooded his veins. Sitting cross-legged on his bed, he began circulating the Body Tempering Mantra.

The moment his cultivation energy stirred, Guan Yu's eyes flew open in shock. His Body Forging realm – previously at the Fifth Layer – now pulsed with Seventh Layer power! The familiar meridian lines on his arm had increased from five to seven. As he channeled energy, milky-white essence seeped through his pores.

"Am I still dreaming?" he cried hoarsely. "How could Fifth Layer physique leap to Seventh overnight? Moreover, the condensed body essence isn't black, but silvery-white! Does surviving calamity truly bring fortune? That substance within the Serpent Flower's roots must be extraordinary!"

Though unaware of events following his death, Guan Yu instinctively knew the root's mysterious contents had triggered this transformation.

"Such luck demands exploitation. I must break through to Qi Refining Stage immediately! Only then can I learn proper techniques for self-preservation. Seventh Layer Body Forging still leaves me vulnerable!" Despite his astonishment, clarity pierced through – momentary advantages meant nothing without consolidated power.

Dawn's mist clung thickly to the secluded mountain forest, reducing visibility to hazy outlines. From a clearing atop the peak came labored grunts. There, a slender figure stood in peculiar stance, palms pressed together. With each muscle tremor, his face contorted painfully. Beads of sweat rolled down skin gleaming with increasingly dense, silvery radiance.

This was Guan Yu. Yesterday's miracle hadn't bred complacency – childhood hardships had forged unrelenting discipline. Unlike pampered peers, his youth held no joy. A stern father, clan disdain, and constant bullying cultivated iron resilience. Sweat dripped steadily, drenching grass beneath him. Stinging saline rivers blurred his vision, twisting features into grotesque mask. Where others might take fifteen days progressing from Seventh Layer to Qi Refining, Guan Yu compressed the agony into mere days. Every moment brought excruciating muscle compression, torment screeching through his nerves.

He welcomed the burning fatigue – breakthroughs often emerged from such extremes. But as dizziness threatened consciousness, a brilliant light erupted from his heart, shooting to his crown point. The illumination jolted him awake. "What sorcery is this?" Guan Yu gasped, noticing reduced pain and mental clarity. Unbeknownst to him, the stone heart fused with his own pulsed faintly before quieting.

Seizing this reprieve, Guan Yu resumed cultivation. Whenever vertigo returned, the mysterious organ emitted restorative light. This symbiotic cycle continued until dusk of the third day. With sudden roar, the seven black stripes on his right arm fused into single radiant silver band!

Typically, advancing from Seventh Layer Body Forging to First Layer Qi Refining produced silvery streaks flecked with black. Yet Guan Yu's stripe shone pure argent, flawless as quicksilver. "Heaven's luck!" he exulted. "How many in our town achieve such purity? Even Father's breakthrough paled in comparison!" Clenching fists, he reveled in newfound power – unimaginable progress without medicinal aids, achieved through stone heart's mystery and relentless effort.

As Guan Yu basked in triumph, a gruff voice interrupted: "So here you are. Thought you'd wandered into Demon Night Forest again." Turning, he saw his linen-clad father Guan Xiao beneath a pine. The stern man's reproach died on lips – his son's silvery aura and arm marking sparked rare approval.

"Father! Why are you here?"

"First Layer Qi Refining. Impressive. That pure silver stripe... even I failed to achieve such." Guan Xiao's weathered face cracked a smile. "You've surpassed my expectations."

Guan Yu's eyes widened. "Yours wasn't this pure?"

"Mixed with black impurities," Guan Xiao admitted. Pride swelled in Guan Yu's chest – childhood vow to outshine his father now bore fruit.

The elder's eyes misted. Mere days ago, this boy struggled at Fifth Layer. The excruciating leap to Qi Refining spoke of unimaginable grit – progress achieved without paternal assistance stung Guan Xiao's heart.

"Now you've reached Qi Refining," Guan Xiao cleared his throat, "time to learn basic martial arts. I'll impart a qi circulation method and fist technique. Combined, they'll boost combat prowess beyond ordinary First Layer practitioners." With sleeve flick, two manuals landed in Guan Yu's hands before the father descended the mountain.

Guan Yu stared at the texts, then at his father's retreating back. "YES! Martial arts at last!" His whoop echoed through peaks.

"Child..." Guan Xiao murmured halfway down, "the path ahead is yours. Don't fail me."

The manuals' titles gleamed – "Turtle Breath Art" and "Force Fist". Guan Yu devoured the pages. "Turtle Breath: Ten Years Without Air, Vitality Remains". Astonishing! The technique taught gathering ambient qi into dantian, forming energy sea for oxygen-independent survival. Paired with Force Fist's explosive power, even Third Layer opponents might be challenged!

After hurried dinner with relieved mother (and father's corroboration about "training"), Guan Yu locked himself in chambers. Cross-legged on bed, he began cycling qi according to the profound text. The stone heart pulsed rhythmically, its warm radiance accelerating cultivation...

**Chapter 1480: Low-Grade Martial Arts**

"Martial arts divide into nine grades across three tiers," Guan Xiao had explained. "1-3 are Low, 4-6 Middle, 7-9 High. These Low-Tier Grade One techniques – Force Fist and Turtle Breath Art – synergize well. Master them, and you'll rival Third Layer adepts."

Guan Yu harbored no disappointment at "low-grade" classification. His clan's strongest art was Middle-Tier Grade Five, obtained by ancestors through perilous ventures. True masters could elevate simple techniques – his current focus was foundation.

As moon rose, silvery light enveloped the diligent youth. The stone heart's glow intensified, resonating with Turtle Breath's qi channels. Unbeknownst to Guan Yu, his dantian's energy sea expanded at thrice normal rate...
