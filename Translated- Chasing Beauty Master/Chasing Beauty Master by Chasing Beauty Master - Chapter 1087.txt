“Younger brother Guan Yu is deliberately throwing out some flattery. All women are the same – they love being complimented on their youth and beauty. Especially someone like Yao Yu, who's already past forty, she absolutely revels in such praise.”

Yao Yu's face lit up at Guan Yu's words, her fingers brushing her cheek as if confirming her rejuvenated appearance. With a honeyed laugh, she said, “Oh Guan Yu, you silver-tongued charmer! Giggles…”

Lü Mei immediately protested, “You think you're so clever with sweet talk! My mother isn't old at all! What do you mean she's 'become younger'? Can't you even give proper compliments?”

“Mei Mei!” Yao Yu chided, her earlier smile replaced by maternal sternness. “How can you speak to Guan Yu like that? Don't you know basic manners?” Having basked in Guan Yu's praise, she now firmly sided with him.

“It's alright,” Guan Yu shrugged with practiced resignation. “I'm used to it by now.”

Yao Yu's expression hardened as she scrutinized her daughter. This constant bickering cast doubt on their supposedly harmonious life in Qiaoyuan District. “How can you two communicate like this?” she demanded. “After living together so long, I'm beginning to suspect unresolved issues between you!”

Guan Yu chuckled disarmingly. “It's not as dire as you think. Mei Mei has a fiery temperament, and I'm not one to back down. We've settled into this... dynamic. Really, I've grown accustomed to it.”

“My temperament?!” Lü Mei exploded, jabbing a finger at him. “You're always the one provoking me!”

Yao Yu's concern deepened. “Do you two quarrel often?” Her earlier enthusiasm about their cohabitation wavered.

“N-Not really!” Lü Mei backtracked, noticing her mother's disapproval. “Just occasional playful bickering! Actually, Guan Yu treats me wonderfully sometimes.” Her voice dwindled under Yao Yu's skeptical gaze.

Xue Jing facepalmed at the disastrous self-sabotage. “Aunt Yao, let me explain. Their relationship is like those legendary couples – sparring builds affection. Back at Emperor's College, they bickered constantly before falling in love. Even now, their arguments are just flirtatious banter, not marital discord. Please don't misunderstand.”

Recognition dawned on Yao Yu's face. She'd been similarly spirited in her youth, constantly challenging her late husband. That passionate bond had sustained her through widowhood. Observing the blushing Lü Mei now chasing Guan Yu around the sofa with a cushion, she finally understood – this was their love language.

“Stop!” Xue Jing ordered as cushions flew. “We have guests!”

“No!” Lü Mei shouted, emboldened by her mother's presence. “He needs to pay!”

Guan Yu skidded to a halt, raising his hands in surrender. “Alright, spitfire. One free hit if we make peace?”

“Stand still then!” Lü Mei demanded, charging forward. Guan Yu timed his pivot perfectly, catching her mid-lunge. Their lips met in a calculated “accident” that left Lü Mei scarlet-cheeked.

“You... shameless rogue!” She pummeled his chest before fleeing upstairs, leaving Yao Yu chuckling at the youthful theatrics.

As negotiations resumed over Fang family shares, Yao Yu played her opening gambit: “Twenty million.”

Guan Yu's smile tightened. The shares were worth nearly thirty. “Auntie, that's daylight robbery! Have mercy on this poor son-in-law!”

“Poor?” Yao Yu arched an eyebrow. “Shall I subsidize your household then? My daughter deserves proper care.”

The verbal fencing continued, Liu Lawyer watching greedily. This deal meant five million in his pocket – enough to finally pursue the wealthy widow properly. His eyes lingered on Yao Yu's elegant neckline, imagining the empire he could inherit through marriage...

Meanwhile, Guan Yu recalibrated. Hardball wouldn't work against this seasoned businesswoman. Time to deploy his secret weapon. Catching Lü Mei's eye peeking from the staircase, he flashed their private signal – three rapid blinks. On cue, she stormed in brandishing a hairbrush.

“Guan Yu! Where's my jade pendant?”

As chaos reignited, Guan Yu hid his smile. Let Yao Yu see her daughter's “uncontrollable” temper. The share price just went up.
