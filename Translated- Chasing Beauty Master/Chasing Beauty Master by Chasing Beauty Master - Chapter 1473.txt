“After all, this matter was previously unknown to anyone. Now that Xiao Zhi has already absorbed fifty years of Elder Lu’s spiritual power cultivation, all that remains is another fifty years’ worth from someone else to completely eradicate the Blood Poison within him.

Xiao Zhi thought to himself that if Elder Zheng were to assist him, he’d be overjoyed. He wouldn’t fret over Elder Zheng losing fifty years of cultivation either. Cultivators held little attachment to time—another fifty years and Elder Zheng would regain his peak condition. It wasn’t an irreparable loss.

Wang Jun remarked, “Elder Xiang was carried off for treatment after being humiliated before the disciples. Naturally, he’s too embarrassed to show his face now.”

“I truly hope Elder Xiang honors his bet once healed,” Xiao Zhi said with a wry shake of his head. “Let’s see if he forgets about me then.”

“Unlikely. Even if Elder Xiang forgets, Guan Yu won’t,” Wang Jun replied. “Though Guan Yu seems to have urgent business requiring him to descend the mountain temporarily. Master ordered me to accompany him tomorrow. By our return, Elder Xiang should be recovered. Guan Yu will surely press him to fulfill the agreement—rest assured.”

“Hmm, I do trust Guan Yu completely.” Xiao Zhi suddenly recalled something. “Speaking of which, when Guan Yu returned during the disciples’ inspection, did the Sect Master examine him?”

Xiao Zhi knew about the Eight-Sided Drum Art within Guan Yu’s body. Though he’d learned this from Yanzhao, his own prior suspicions had already crystallized. The first chapter of that forbidden technique undoubtedly resided in Guan Yu.

When Guan Yu and Wang Xiaorong had explored Patriarch Menghua’s underground palace years ago, Xiao Zhi suspected Guan Yu had obtained the technique there despite later denials. The mystery of Guan Yu’s motives lingered.

Yet Xiao Zhi found Guan Yu’s character inscrutable. Regardless, after his own fall from grace, he appreciated Guan Yu’s continued loyalty. The man’s fierce brotherhood and inherent goodness were beyond question.

What troubled Xiao Zhi was whether Guan Yu might someday betray Yunqing Sect. This remained uncertain, dependent entirely on Guan Yu’s own choices. Even persuasion would prove futile should that day arrive.

“He was examined by Xuanming himself,” Wang Jun confirmed. “The verdict declared Guan Yu’s spiritual energy pure—only Yunqing Sect’s cultivation traces. His loyalty is unquestionable.”

Xiao Zhi shot Wang Jun an exasperated look at the casual use of the Sect Master’s name. “That’s reassuring. No complications then.”

Though perplexed how Guan Yu had evaded detection, Xiao Zhi welcomed the outcome. Recent days had seen Yunqing disciples scouring the jianghu for Guan Yu without success, as if he’d vanished—only to reappear suddenly, unscathed. The mystery defied understanding, so Xiao Zhi resolved to set it aside.

“Thank you for updating me on these developments,” Xiao Zhi said warmly. “Without you, I’d remain ignorant in confinement. All your news brings hope.”

The crucial revelation—that a century’s spiritual cultivation could cure him—loomed large. A hundred years’ power sounded staggering, yet achievable given current circumstances.

“No need for formalities between friends,” Wang Jun chuckled. Observing Xiao Zhi’s honest, if somewhat simple nature, he noted the contrast with their sharper-witted companion A’Ze.

Concern resurfaced. “Regarding Elder Xiang’s injury—how long until recovery? Guan Yu’s firearm struck his leg...”

**Chapter 3840: Shameless**

“Now you’ve stumped me,” Wang Jun admitted. “I’m unfamiliar with medical treatments here. Normally, extracting the bullet and fortnight’s rest suffices for leg wounds.”

Xiao Zhi stared blankly, comprehending only the mention of half a month.

Recognizing his confusion, Wang Jun clarified: “It depends on whether the bullet remains embedded and if surgeons here can remove it. With the projectile extracted and spiritual healing, recovery might take merely a week.”

“That’s quick! My mind eases then,” Xiao Zhi exhaled in relief.

“Eager for Elder Xiang to purge your Blood Poison?” Wang Jun teased.

“Naturally! Each day here costs me a year’s lifespan. I crave freedom and normalcy.”

“Rest assured—I’ll remind Guan Yu. He’ll ensure Elder Xiang complies. Endure a few more days.”

“It seems I must,” Xiao Zhi conceded. “When you depart with Guan Yu tomorrow, hasten your return. Urge him to press Elder Xiang.”

“The mission’s purpose remains unclear. Master said the Sect Master appointed me as Guan Yu’s aide since you’re... indisposed. Could it involve seeking Miao City in the desert?”

“Unlikely. That quest isn’t urgent. The Sect Master wouldn’t redeploy Guan Yu so soon.”

“Then why require assistance? What challenge demands multiple hands? We’ll learn tomorrow.”

“My concern remains Elder Xiang’s recovery. Severe complications would prove disastrous.”

“Guan Yu exercises restraint. Elder Xiang overestimates his cunning—Guan Yu always retains contingencies.”

Wang Jun continued: “Last time, Elder Xiang accused Guan Yu of偷袭 with the Emperor’s Seal. This ‘fair’ duel under Xuanming’s supervision still saw Elder Xiang fearful of Guan Yu’s artifacts. He demanded Guan Yu keep the Seal distant during combat.”

“Stay longer at Yunqing Sect and you’ll understand Elder Xiang’s true nature.”

Glancing at the darkening sky, Wang Jun rose. “I’ll take my leave. Remember—Xuanming knows you’re framed. Don’t dwell on extraneous matters.”

Xiao Zhi nodded. “Convey my gratitude to Guan Yu.”

“He disdains formalities, but I’ll relay it.” Departing, Wang Jun ignored the absent guard—Xiao Zhi wouldn’t flee even with open doors.

**Chapter 3841: Carry My Things**

At dawn, Wang Jun arrived at Tiger Head Peak. Finding Guan Yu’s door ajar, he slipped inside silently. The room revealed Guan Yu still snoring, heedless of security.

Resisting the urge to startle him—mindful of Huiju Peak’s Shi Zhen incident—Wang Jun opted for a booming shout: “Rise and shine!”

Guan Yu shot up defensively before recognizing his visitor. With a groan, he collapsed back onto bed.

“What nocturnal mischief left you so drained?” Wang Jun prodded, tugging the covers. “We’ve a mission! I’ve awaited this for ages!”

Guan Yu mumbled into his pillow: “Let the dream continue... Later...”

“Later? It’s midday! The Sect Master’s orders!”

Grudgingly, Guan Yu sat up. “Must you channel roosters? I’m a notorious late-riser.”

“You frequent the jianghu at leisure while I moldered here! This outing’s my reprieve—don’t ruin it!”

“Impatient fledgling,” Guan Yu yawned. “Very well. I’ll ready myself. Our task? Simple procurement—you’ll serve as pack mule.”

“Pack mule? With this physique?” Wang Jun gestured at himself. “Malicious intent!”

“Decline then. Plenty volunteers covet this ‘privilege’.”

“...Fine. Lead on.”

“Wise choice. Previous missions risked life and limb—this is holiday by comparison. Don’t feign frailty either. The Blood Poison grants you abnormal strength—every curse bears blessings.”

Wang Jun paled, glancing about. “Are you mad? Shout it louder why don’t you! Seeking my execution?”

Guan Yu winced at his slip. “Apologies—careless tongue. It won’t recur.”

“See that it doesn’t. Now move!”

After hasty preparations, they visited Xuanming’s hall before departure. At the stables of Front Return Peak, Elder Lu presented two gleaming steeds.

“My thanks, Elder Lu,” Guan Yu bowed. “Such fine mounts do us honor.”

“Yunqing’s rising star deserves naught less,” Elder Lu smiled. “Return them unharmed.”

“Worry not—unless I ditch them mid-journey for swifter flight!” Guan Yu quipped, mounting up. As hooves clattered down the mountain path, Wang Jun’s spirits soared—freedom, however brief, tasted sweet.
