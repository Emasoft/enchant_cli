The disciples of Xuanzhong Peak roared with laughter, utterly disregarding the fury of Zuokong Peak's followers. Upon hearing these taunts, Wen Ming nearly coughed blood in rage. During this moment of distraction, Xiao Zhi's spell energy pillar blasted directly into him, sending Wen Ming's entire body flying several meters before crashing at the arena's edge.

Xiao Zhi remained rooted in place, not pursuing for a follow-up attack. Instead, he prepared another spell—should Wen Ming dare rise again, he wouldn't hesitate to strike immediately.

"Yesss! Xiao Zhi wins! You're the best, Xiao Zhi!"

"Brilliant move, Xiao Zhi!"

The Xuanzhong disciples erupted into frenzied celebration as if possessed, heedless of whether Wen Ming could still stand. Their jubilant cheers twisted the faces of Zuokong Peak's members with impotent rage.

Seeing Wen Ming prone on the ground, Xiao Zhi refrained from attacking further. By tournament rules, a fallen opponent was considered defenseless and untouchable—any strike now would result in disqualification.

Xiao Zhi stood waiting while two arbitrators observed from adjacent seats. These adjudicators, one from each faction, ensured fair play. The Zuokong arbitrator now rose to assess Wen Ming's condition, for this was no cozy hearthside where one could lounge indefinitely.

"Wen Ming, can you continue?" the arbitrator bent to inquire.

The fallen cultivator lay facing outward, back turned to the arena. His stillness suggested unconsciousness—until the arbitrator suddenly recoiled in alarm. Guan Yu's warning shout pierced the air: "Xiao Zhi! He's casting!"

This thunderous cry silenced the celebrating Xuanzhong disciples. The revelation struck clear—Wen Ming hadn't been incapacitated, but secretly reciting incantations with his hidden hands. Protected by tournament rules, he'd exploited this shield to prepare a counterstrike. Once his spell completed, a sudden reversal would leave Xiao Zhi no time to react.

Guan Yu's sharp eyes had detected the telltale glow and subtle hand movements. As the arbitrator approached, the ruse became undeniable.

Xiao Zhi instantly shifted tactics. Rather than defense, he aimed his prepped offensive spell at Wen Ming's position. The moment the prone figure moved, destruction would follow.

True to prediction, Wen Ming whirled up with blazing radiance, unleashing a point-blank shockwave without warning.

"Treacherous cur!" Xiao Zhi sneered, his own spell erupting simultaneously. "Even if this succeeds, you'll be disqualified!"

Twin energies collided midair with deafening detonation. The resulting lightflare blinded onlookers. When vision cleared, only Xiao Zhi remained standing within bounds—clothes tattered, sleeves vaporized, but victorious.

Wen Ming sprawled beyond the arena's edge, blood trickling from his lips, ribs fractured. Zuokong disciples rushed to their fallen comrade as Xuanzhong's cheers redoubled.

"Congratulations to Xuanzhong's young master," the Zuokong arbitrator conceded bitterly. "Rest well for tomorrow's match."

This opening victory set a triumphant tone. Though Wen Ming's underhanded tactics had marred the bout, Xuanzhong's Headmaster Zheng saw no need for further reprimand—victory spoke loudest.

Descending the arena, Xiao Zhi clapped Guan Yu's shoulder. "How's that for performance? Told you I'd floor him!"

"Impressive," Guan Yu grinned, deliberately loud. "Though Wen Ming's cheap shot disappoints. I never imagined Yunqing Sect housed such dishonorable practitioners."

The barbed comment struck home. Humiliated Zuokong disciples shuffled away, their earlier bravado extinguished.

Headmaster Zheng observed the trio thoughtfully. Though Guan Yu had only joined three days prior, his bond with Xiao Zhi and A-Ze appeared years-deep. This alliance with Xuanzhong clearly estranged them from Zuokong—a calculated risk Zheng deemed worthwhile. Guan Yu's rising star would surely illuminate Xuanzhong's future.

"Now that I've won," Xiao Zhi whispered conspiratorially, "shouldn't you treat me to drinks?"

Guan Yu chuckled. "By that logic, you owe me for last night's bout against A-Cai." Sect rules forbade alcohol, but resourceful disciples always found ways.

Their discussion turned to procurement. Though Qianhui Peak monopolized brewing through its fertile lowland resources, Xiao Zhi had mastered the art of "borrowing" from his father's private stock—a poorly-kept secret Headmaster Zheng deliberately ignored.

As the trio plotted their celebratory feast, Zheng pretended deafness and withdrew. His finest vintages might suffer depletion, but youthful camaraderie held its own value.

"Let's hunt game in the woods!" Xiao Zhi proposed. "Guan Yu's even brought spices!"

Their plan hit a snag at Tigerhead Peak's bustling entrance. With half the sect congregated here, slipping into the forbidden forest unnoticed proved impossible.

"Walk in boldly?" A-Ze suggested.

"Too risky," Guan Yu cautioned. "After last night's incident, Zuokong watches us like hawks. One misstep..."

The dilemma hung unresolved—a minor cloud on their victorious morning. Yet for three young cultivators, obstacles merely seasoned adventure.
