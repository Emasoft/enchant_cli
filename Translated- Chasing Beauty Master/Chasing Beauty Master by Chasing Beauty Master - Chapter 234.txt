Guan Yu paid no heed to the scornful sneers beside him, his gaze fixed intently on the two cards held by the banker and player. He urged, "Hurry up and reveal the cards already."

The person who had bet on "Tie" was none other than Guan Yu, who had been observing the casino for quite some time.

The man cautiously opening his cards at the gambling table glared fiercely at Guan Yu upon hearing his impatience. He had wagered fifty thousand – nearly half a year's income and his entire savings. Losing would mean complete ruin, another cautionary tale of destitution.

His hands trembled visibly as he prepared to check the card's edge. Guan Yu's sudden prodding made him flinch, humiliation burning his cheeks. Though unwilling to show weakness, he redirected his resentment towards Guan Yu.

The delay in revealing cards drew collective ire from the crowd. The banker had already shown a face card and seven of diamonds – seven points total, a strong advantage. Those who bet on banker grew increasingly agitated.

This tension and pressure embodied the casino's allure.

The player, flushed and breathless, kept wiping the edge of his cards. "No edge! No edge!" shouted those who bet on player.

"Hey, actually no edge!" When the cards were fully revealed, a heart-pounding King of Clubs appeared. The gambler exhaled heavily, his palms slick with sweat.

With one edgeless card revealed, his chances now depended on the other card being eight or nine – slim odds. His momentary relief vanished as anxiety resurged.

"Eight! Eight!" The crowd betting on player stared fixedly at the table, willing their victory.

"Edged." The card handler's sweaty fingers slowly lifted the edge, revealing crimson heart patterns one by one. When three vivid hearts appeared, the gambler's hands shook violently, his face crimson with excitement.

This card had to be seven or eight. A seven meant tie – his fifty thousand lost. An eight meant winning fifty thousand, half a year's wages saved, enough for a decent car. His conviction that this was Eight of Hearts overwhelmed him; the possibility of seven seemed unthinkable despite never witnessing a tie before.

As he prepared for a dramatic movie-style reveal, the card suddenly vanished from his grip.

"Fuck, just flip the damn card already! Making my heart pound like this." A burly, dark-skinned man snatched the card and slammed it onto the table. His forceful move would have been impressive if not for his rough appearance.

The robbed gambler sprang up angrily. "What the hell's wrong with you, asshole?" he shouted, then froze upon seeing the hulking figure towering over him. Casino experience taught him not to challenge stronger opponents, whether wealthier or physically dominant.

Swallowing his rage, he stammered apologies: "S-sorry, big brother, I just..." He trailed off, noticing the man staring past him in confusion.

The crowd gasped collectively. "Fuck! Seven of Hearts? Shitty luck today!" spat the brute, Niu Le.

Hearing this, the ruined gambler whirled around. His face drained of color. "Seven... Seven of Hearts? Impossible!" he muttered numbly.

Only when the dealer collected the player's chips did he snap back to reality. Whirling on Niu Le regardless of the size difference, he grabbed the man's collar, eyes bloodshot. "You! It must've been you!"

"The fuck's your problem? Don't even know you!" Niu Le, having bet on player and lost, shook off the grip angrily.

"You switched my cards! You cheated! Were you the one who bet on Tie?" the man roared.

"Fuck your mother! Get lost before I lose it!" Niu Le slapped the arm away.

"Everyone saw you steal my card! Back me up here!" The man appealed to fellow losers.

Suddenly, Niu Le became public enemy number one.

Desperation strips rationality. The mob latched onto Niu Le's card grab as proof of cheating, refusing to release their lifeline.

Niu Le proved no easy target. Producing a machete from his canvas bag, he roared, "I said it wasn't me! Fuck around and find out!"

Many fell silent. A gleaming blade changes perspectives – money can be regained, lives cannot. Yet some value money over life.

The fifty-thousand loser stood defiant. "We all saw you switch! Pay up!" He puffed his chest, banking on modern society's restraints against public violence.

Niu Le swung at the instigator's shoulder. "Shut your lying mouth!"

The man collapsed, screaming "Help!" as the blade descended. Bystanders averted eyes – none would challenge an armed madman.

When death didn't come, he mentally thanked bodhisattvas... until Niu Le's voice interrupted: "Boss! You're here?"

Only one person could stay Niu Le's hand – Guan Yu, who'd brought him into this life.

"Can't I visit where you play?" Guan Yu chided. The situation had escalated beyond expectation. Knowing Niu Le's history of police encounters, intervention was necessary. Plus, his own 80,000 yuan Tie bet remained unpaid.

"Handle your fun later," Guan Yu said, pressing down the machete. "I'll settle this."

Niu Le complied instantly. Guan Yu loomed over the cowering man. "You accused my brother of cheating?"

"N-no! Misunderstanding!" The man stammered, intimidated by Guan Yu's presence and perceived gang connections.

Guan Yu scanned the crowd. "Shall we clarify for everyone?" Under his gaze, accusers scattered to other tables.

New gamblers quickly filled vacancies. Turning to the dealer, Guan Yu smiled. "My Tie bet?"

The dealer hesitated briefly before producing 80,000 in chips. Guan Yu's smile widened. "Let's play a round."

As he sat down, Niu Le dragged over a chair. "Boss, you ever played before?"

"Second time," Guan Yu replied, drawing groans from onlookers.

The banker seat remained empty – gamblers feared Guan Yu's supposed luck. The dealer assumed banker role.

"Deal," Guan Yu ordered. Fresh deck shuffled, cards distributed.

"Third card, sir?" the dealer asked.

"Why not?" Guan Yu's response drew eye-rolls.

Niu Le facepalmed. "Boss, you rookie?"

"Second-timer," Guan Yu corrected.

As bets were placed, Guan Yu toyed with his chips. The Tie area stayed empty except for his 80,000. Collective headshakes followed – hitting Tie twice seemed impossible.

Niu Le bet 1,000 on banker. "Fifteen banker wins in last twenty rounds," he explained. "If you lose, I'll recover some loss."

Guan Yu nearly choked. His 80,000 potential loss versus Niu Le's 1,000 gain? Keeping Niu Le in school suddenly seemed wise.

When bets closed, Guan Yu's lone stack at Tie stood like a solitary warrior.
