Guan Yu pondered that it wasn’t merely due to the Right Envoy’s intrusion, but perhaps something designed by Ancestor Menghua from nearly a millennium ago.

To think that after such an immense span of time, the objects within that chamber remained perfectly preserved, as pristine as new—this could only be attributed to the power of the Eight-Drum Technique. Yet once Guan Yu stored the technique within the Imperial Seal, the chamber lost its sustaining energy. Without that force, everything crumbled to dust in an instant.

These matters no longer concerned Guan Yu. With the Eight-Drum Technique now secured, their priority was to find an exit.

He glanced at Miao Zhang’s lifeless form on the ground and sighed. Had the man survived, he might have known the way out. Now, they could only rely on themselves.

“Let’s leave,” the Right Envoy suggested, gesturing toward a stairway along the wall leading to a door. “Since the Eight-Drum Technique isn’t here, we must search elsewhere.”

Guan Yu eyed the tunnel they’d entered through—a route too long and tedious to retrace. The door above seemed a better gamble, though its height—three stories up—left him wary. They were still in Miao City, and danger likely lurked beyond.

“Stay close behind me,” Guan Yu ordered as he ascended the stairs. “Stay alert.”

A thick iron door awaited them, its hefty lock unfastened. After listening for movement outside and hearing none, he pushed it open.

The sight stunned him. Instead of deserts, ancient forests, or perilous terrain, they emerged into a cityscape of towering six-story buildings reminiscent of old Huaxia.

“We’re in grave danger here,” Guan Yu urged as the group stepped out. “We mustn’t linger.”

They stood in the heart of Miao City, having surfaced from the underground chamber where Miao Zhang had guarded the Eight-Drum Technique for years.

“Where is this?” the Right Envoy murmured, surveying the unfamiliar surroundings. “Have we left Miao City?”

“This *is* Miao City’s center,” Guan Yu hissed. “The demonic cultivators here are formidable. Keep silent if we encounter anyone. Speed is our only safety.”

The deserted square, encircled by iron railings, seemed a forbidden zone—likely restricted to protect Miao Zhang’s secret. Their trespass demanded swift departure before detection.

“We’ve no time left to search for the technique,” Guan Yu said, pointing at the setting sun. “Once night falls here, dawn breaks in the desert. The portal will vanish by daylight. If we miss it, we’re trapped here for a year.”

The prospect chilled them all.

“Follow me,” Guan Yu commanded, gripping Siqi’s hand. “We leave Miao City first.”

Though the Right Envoy seethed at their failure, urgency overrode frustration. Time trickled away.

As they navigated the railings, a shout froze them: “What are you doing here? This is Elder Miao’s forbidden ground!”

A demonic cultivator glared from beyond the fence. Guan Yu whispered, “Aunt Right Envoy—trouble’s found us.”

“One opponent means nothing,” she scoffed.

“But these towers house hundreds,” Guan Yu countered. “A fight would summon them all.”

**Chapter 4644: The Bluff Begins**

“Identify yourselves!” The cultivator remained outside the railings, wary of crossing the boundary. “None may enter Elder Miao’s sanctum. How did you breach it?”

Exchanging glances, Guan Yu and the Right Envoy settled on deception.

“We’re Elder Miao’s honored guests,” Guan Yu proclaimed, stepping forward. “The restrictions don’t apply to us. He invited us here personally.”

The man frowned. Miao Zhang never entertained guests, especially not in this forbidden zone. The strangers’ attire seemed foreign, and today’s Ghost Festival forbade outdoor gatherings.

“If you’re his guests, where is Elder Miao now?”

“We drank deeply during our reunion,” Guan Yu lied smoothly. “He left while we slept. Do you know his whereabouts?”

The man hesitated. Encountering Elder Miao while violating curfew would bring punishment. “I know nothing. Find him yourselves.”

As he turned to leave, another voice barked, “Erxiao! What’s happening?”

A stern elder approached—Yan Shu. Erxiao explained the situation, prompting Yan Shu’s scrutiny.

“Elder Miao would never host outsiders here,” Yan Shu declared. “Erxiao, fetch him. Let these impostors face his judgment.”

Panic surged—Miao Zhang’s corpse lay below, rendering this bluff perilous.

**Chapter 4645: Forbidden Grounds**

As Erxiao departed, Guan Yu whispered to the Right Envoy, “If this fails, we fight our way out.”

“Wisdom before force,” she cautioned. “A battle here would doom us.”

Meanwhile, Erxiao encountered Xiao Hei near Miao Zhang’s residence. The girl, having gorged on treats, revealed, “Grandpa Miao isn’t home.”

Learning of the intruders, Xiao Hei rushed to the scene, recognizing Guan Yu. “Big Brother, why are you here? This place is forbidden!”

Guan Yu recycled his lie: “Elder Miao invited us. We awoke to find him gone.”

Yan Shu remained skeptical. “Erxiao will return with Elder Miao. None move till then.”

Time dwindled as the sun dipped lower. Guan Yu’s mind raced—they couldn’t afford to wait for a corpse to be fetched.

Xiao Hei, sensing peril, interjected, “Grandpa Yan, if they entered without guidance, wouldn’t alarms have sounded? Maybe Grandpa Miao truly brought them.”

Yan Shu’s resolve wavered. Guan Yu seized the opening: “Let us exit peacefully. When Elder Miao arrives, all will be clear.”

But Yan Shu stood firm. “None move until Erxiao returns.”

Trapped between a dead elder and a closing portal, Guan Yu prepared for desperate measures. The stakes had never been higher.
