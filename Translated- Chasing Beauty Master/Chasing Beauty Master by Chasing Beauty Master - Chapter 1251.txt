Now, it seemed this was the only way to understand the situation. Guan Yu tossed and turned on the bed, unable to sleep. After lying awake for a long time, he felt a sudden urge to urinate and got up to head to the latrine.

Having stayed in bed for so long, the outside air felt chilly. Too lazy to retrieve his clothes, Guan Yu dashed out wearing only shorts, his bare torso exposed as he sprinted toward the latrine.

Back in the metropolis, Guan Yu had enjoyed the luxury of high-end toilets. A single toilet in Qiaoyuan District could cost over a hundred thousand yuan, offering automated features like water sprays and warm air drying—no need for toilet paper. Pure indulgence.

But here? Not even proper toilet paper existed. They used xuan paper meant for calligraphy, which tore easily. The more fastidious resorted to cloth scraps, as no decent paper was available in this place.

Hugging himself against the cold, Guan Yu hurried toward the latrine with his head lowered. Never had he imagined living in such primitive conditions. The latrine lay beyond a fence across the courtyard.

The shortest path required passing several room doors. As he neared one chamber, he faintly heard unusual noises inside. Yet the Juhe Peak's rear courtyard exuded such heavy yin energy that Guan Yu dared not court trouble. He kept his head down and pressed onward.

Fortunately, the late hour meant no one was around. The latrine's "door" was merely a crude fence of woven branches. Upon entering, Guan Yu gaped in disbelief. The facility consisted of two planks straddling a large vat—this was the restroom for Juhe Peak's female disciples. "Holy hell," he muttered. "This is it? One wrong move and you're taking a plunge!"

Peering at the murky contents below, Guan Yu sighed. What began as a simple need to urinate now churned his stomach from the stench. Resigned, he squatted over the planks.

The posture felt oddly nostalgic—a stark contrast to his metropolitan toilet throne. Different comforts, though prolonged squatting strained his legs.

Mid-relief, distant footsteps approached. Through the branch fence, Guan Yu spotted pale ankles rushing toward him. The loose robes and delicate feet indicated a woman. Of course—everyone here except him was female. Panic surged: she was heading straight for the latrine! With only one facility, a collision seemed inevitable.

His mind raced. Should he announce his presence? Maybe she'd wait outside. But startling her risked worse consequences. A cough might serve as discreet warning.

As Guan Yu cleared his throat, the branch door swung open. Looking up, he met the wide-eyed stare of a white-robed woman.

"Ah—!"

Her scream pierced the night, reaching frequencies Guan Yu never knew possible. Her horrified gaze locked onto his exposed lower half.

**Chapter 3216: The Joke**

"Senior sister, please stop screaming!" Guan Yu waved frantically. "Let me explain—!"

His pleas drowned in her ear-splitting shrieks. Lights flickered on across the compound. Guan Yu's heart sank—the entire peak would descend upon them any moment, catching him mid-business.

He needed to stand, but realization struck: he'd brought no paper. Trapped between humiliation and exposure, his face darkened with despair.

"Pervert!" The disciple launched into a second screeching crescendo, illuminating every window.

When her vocal marathon ended twelve seconds later, Guan Yu pleaded hoarsely: "Senior sister, might I beg a favor?"

Collecting herself, the woman nodded cautiously.

Guan Yu forced a smile. "Could you spare some paper? I... didn't bring any."

The disciple—still catching her breath—suddenly burst into giggles. Her eyes darted downward curiously. "So you're stuck here paperless? Perfect!" She danced like a delighted sprite, finding perverse joy in his predicament.

Though plain-faced, her lively demeanor contrasted sharply with her earlier fury. Guan Yu groaned internally—he'd become this girl's entertainment.

"Senior sister, mercy! Others are coming. If they find me like this..." He gestured helplessly. "I'll owe you forever!"

Her eyes gleamed. "I'll give paper... on one condition."

"Anything!" Guan Yu blurted as footsteps approached.

"Promise to fulfill a future request of mine."

"Done! Now the paper!"

Grinning, she produced thick calligraphy paper from her robes—still warm from body heat. Guan Yu snatched it, cleaned up hastily, and stood just as voices arrived.

"Xiaotong! What happened?"

The disciple—Xiaotong—smiled innocently. "Just startled by Junior Brother Guan Yu in the latrine. All's well now."

Elder disciples eyed Guan Yu suspiciously. One matronly woman declared, "Never trust men's lies."

Xiaotong interjected smoothly: "Truly, it was my fault for rushing in. No harm done."

Noticing Guan Yu's pained expression, she asked: "Junior brother, are you unwell?"

Guan Yu grimaced. "Your damned paper's like sandpaper! I'm raw as beef jerky down there!"

**Chapter 3217: Enthusiasm**

Peals of laughter erupted. The coarse xuan paper—embedded with plant fibers—had left its mark. Guan Yu's posterior burned as if scalded.

Xiaotong chirped: "It'll heal. Next time, bring your own!" Her eyes sparkled with mischief.

As the crowd dispersed, Guan Yu hobbled back to his room like a crab, drawing suppressed giggles. The legend of his "battle with xuan paper" would haunt him forever.

Dawn found Guan Yu bleary-eyed from sleepless agony. Though slightly improved, the chafing urged immediate departure. He couldn't face Xiaotong's triumphant smirk or her unspecified favor.

At the main hall, he begged Dai Shouzhuo: "Please send me back to the Ancestral Hall."

The peak mistress feigned concern: "Stay for breakfast! I planned to fetch your friend Jinci—"

"No!" Guan Yu interrupted. "I must return now. Master Jiu might abandon my training!"

Relenting, Dai assigned two junior disciples as escorts. Guan Yu limped through Tiger Head Peak's shortcuts, reaching the Ancestral Hall by midday.

Master Jiu noted his odd gait. "Injured, boy?"

"Just... hemorrhoids." Guan Yu lied through gritted teeth.

As he shuffled toward the kitchen, the old master chuckled quietly. Some lessons, it seemed, couldn't be taught through cultivation manuals alone.
