“Three million one hundred thousand!” At that moment, a voice suddenly rang out from the back. Wang Jun excitedly stood up to look and saw a disheveled man holding up his bidding placard.

Guan Yu chuckled, “Seems there are truly people with deep pockets. Such a high price still finds a buyer.” Earlier, he had assumed no one would bid.

A mere token selling for over three million was almost laughable—only a fool would buy it. Yet Fan Tong on stage not only delivered a smooth pitch but also paraded accompanying beauties to showcase the VIP privileges, enticing the crowd.

Wang Jun sat back down. “It’s not surprising. Many here are regulars who trade for profit margins. Securing VIP status might grant them earlier access to premium goods.”

“True,” Guan Yu agreed. “The greatest perks are unrestricted entry to auctions and front-row seats for the closest view of items.”

Fan Tong continued his animated spiel. The hundred-thousand jump in bid was expected, and he anticipated the token would fetch at least three and a half million.

“Excellent! Bidder Eleven offers three million one hundred ten thousand. Any higher?” Fan Tong gestured grandly. “This token grants lifelong VIP privileges at our Zhongjie Auction House—a status many covet but few attain!”

A server circulated with the token as a woman’s voice called, “Three million two hundred thousand!”

Fan Tong’s smile widened. The higher the token’s price, the greater the auction house’s prestige.

“Bidder Twenty-Seven offers three million two hundred thousand! Who will rise higher? Zhongjie’s reputation is unmatched in the martial world. This rare opportunity won’t return!”

Still unsatisfied, Fan Tong added, “Some may question the token’s value. Let me clarify: Zhongjie guarantees a two-million buyback—permanently. Thus, its selling price naturally exceeds that!”

***Chapter 3895: A Black Blade***

“Three million three hundred thousand!” A bid came from Guan Yu’s neighboring seat. All eyes turned to the bidder—a man already seated in the VIP section.

Murmurs spread. Why would an existing VIP bid? To inflate the price? Was he a plant? The suspicion was palpable.

Fan Tong raised an eyebrow. “Fifth Young Master, you’re already our esteemed VIP. This token holds no use for you. Why bid?”

“I’m often occupied,” the nobleman replied coolly. “An extra token allows my attendants to attend in my stead.”

“How generous! Your retainers need no token for entry. Yet we deeply appreciate your patronage.” Fan Tong bowed with exaggerated gratitude.

Guan Yu observed Fifth Young Master—a man for whom millions were trifling.

“I merely wish to expedite this and proceed to the next item,” the nobleman said dismissively.

“As you wish! Fifth Young Master bids three million three hundred thousand. Going once…”

“Three million five hundred thousand!” The disheveled Bidder Eleven shouted again, determination evident.

Fifth Young Master shrugged, yielding gracefully. The gavel fell, and the scruffy man swaggered to the VIP section, drawing Guan Yu’s disdain.

Wang Jun clapped Guan Yu’s shoulder, elated. “Thanks to you, I’ve just netted three and a half million! I’m rich!”

“Congratulations,” said Wang Xiaorong.

“All credit to Guan Yu,” Wang Jun grinned. Once affluent in China, he’d struggled financially since arriving in this realm. Now, with a windfall and a pouch of gold leaves from Elder Lu, he felt reborn.

***Chapter 3896: Forty-Two Catties***

Fan Tong unveiled a long wooden box. “Our next item: a blade. Not ordinary—this one channels spiritual energy. Its material resembles silver yet surpasses it in hardness. Even our experts remain baffled.”

He drew out a two-foot black blade, its surface rough and锈-encrusted. “Discovered yesterday, it stumped our appraisers. Its anomalous weight defies logic!”

Guan Yu leaned forward. Two servers had carried the box—hinting at extraordinary heft.

“A typical iron blade this size weighs fifteen catties,” a burly man declared.

“Precisely!” Fan Tong nodded. “But this weighs forty-two catties!”

Gasps erupted. Gold itself couldn’t explain such density. The crowd buzzed with theories.

Wang Jun noticed Guan Yu’s keen interest. “You’ll bid for this, won’t you?”

“Patience,” Guan Yu murmured, studying the blade. Its crude craftsmanship belied mysterious origins. The pitted surface suggested unrefined metal, yet its mass hinted at unparalleled density—ideal for reforging into something greater.

***Chapter 3897: An Unexpected Price***

“May I inspect it?” Guan Yu asked.

“Of course!” Fan Tong obliged.

Guan Yu hefted the blade, confirming its astonishing weight. “Ten taels was the seller’s initial ask—for his child’s medicine. After appraisal, we set the floor at one hundred taels, increments of one hundred.”

Wang Jun gaped. “Highway robbery!”

Fan Tong smirked. “The choice is yours, honored guests.”

Guan Yu’s mind raced. Though ugly, the blade’s enigmatic metal called to him. If Master Jiu could decipher its secrets...

He resolved to bid.
