Zhang De’s words earned an approving look from Bill Lin, who now regarded him with increased favor.

“Nine million is too low. At this price, I truly cannot part with it. It doesn’t even reach half of what I anticipated,” Old Wu quavered, as though grievously wronged.

Bill Lin replied, “Master Wu, the price I’ve offered is far from low. You stand to profit over seven million from reselling this hide in just two days. How can you call that meager? Your greed oversteps reason. If this price displeases you, keep it and sell it to another.”

His tone suggested imminent departure, and Old Wu’s composure finally cracked.

Seizing the moment, Zhang De interjected, “Old Wu, a wise man knows when to yield. Let me remind you—Young Master Bill approaches this purchase in earnest. You know full well the risks involved. Circumstances could shift at any moment. It’s best to sell swiftly, lest you lose both the treasure…and your life.”

Panicked, Old Wu began pacing the room. Then he suddenly remembered the man he’d contacted earlier—the one who’d warned that without cooperation, achieving his desired price would prove impossible. The man’s claim of a ninety-ten profit split now seemed less boastful than calculated. Clearly, this had been orchestrated from the start. If he wished to secure a better deal, he had no choice but to seek that person’s aid.

With a strained expression, Old Wu said, “Gentlemen, if you’ll excuse me briefly—I must visit the washroom.” He hurried out.

Once alone, Bill Lin clapped Zhang De’s shoulder jovially. “Your earlier remarks struck true. I’m impressed. If we secure the treasure map for nine million, you’ll be handsomely rewarded.”

“This is merely my duty. Thank you for your trust, Young Master Bill.” Zhang De maintained a humble tone but inwardly rejoiced. He anticipated the situation would soon shift.

If his guess proved correct, Old Wu had stepped out to make a call. Once certain instructions arrived, Zhang De would pivot to advocating for a higher price.

“You don’t truly believe the map is fake, do you?” Bill Lin pressed. “It appears genuine to me.”

“I never said it was counterfeit,” Zhang De chuckled. “This is simply bargaining strategy. Surely you recognize that, Young Master?”

“Of course. Hence my playing along. The act has served us well—Master Wu now scrambles for solutions, likely scheming in the lavatory.” Bill Lin’s excitement brimmed. Acquiring the treasure map at such low cost felt triumphantly thrifty.

Yet one point puzzled him. “Your Elder Yang sent you to buy this map, not aid my purchase. How will you explain losing it to me?”

“There’s nothing to explain,” Zhang De replied smugly. “I haven’t abandoned our bid. Everything I’ve said serves the haggling process.”

Bill Lin stiffened. “So you still intend to compete for it? Was your earlier surrender mere pretense?”

“Don’t misunderstand. My negotiations benefit us both. By feigning withdrawal, I eliminated competition to depress the price. Should we both bid openly, costs would skyrocket. Elder Yang instructed me to minimize expenses—hence this approach.”

Bill Lin shot him a withering glance. His earlier praise now rang hollow—this apparent ally had simply laid groundwork for Yang family interests.

Outside, Old Wu frantically dialed Second Only to Wolf, who sat breakfasting at a diner. Recognizing the caller ID, he answered with a cold laugh. “Not disturbing at all. I’ve been expecting this.”

“Your foresight humbles me,” Old Wu groveled. “My earlier skepticism was foolish. Events unfold exactly as you predicted.”

“Had you heeded me sooner, we’d be celebrating. Your greed blinded you to partnership. Now reality bites.”

“My fault entirely. Had I trusted your wisdom…”

Second Only to Wolf cut through the empty apologies. “New terms: ninety-ten split from a base of fifteen million. Take it or leave Bill Lin to haggle.”

Old Wu’s heart sank—a five million reduction from the original twenty million offer! He cursed inwardly but feigned compliance. “If you guarantee I receive twenty million ultimately…”

“Precisely. Now serve tea to stall them. The real play begins shortly.”

As the line died, Second Only to Wolf texted Zhang De: *Proceed as planned.*

Back inside, Zhang De excused himself “to the washroom,” returning moments later with fabricated news: “Elder Yang confirms the map’s provenance. The corpse found near its discovery site belongs to Poisonous Widow—one of the Jianghu Ten Evils.”

Bill Lin started. Poisonous Widow’s death validated the map’s authenticity—she’d famously stolen a treasure chart from Guan Yu. “How did she die?”

“Unknown,” Zhang De lied smoothly. “But her fatal wounds suggest she buried the map before succumbing. The farmer’s find is genuine.”

When Old Wu reappeared bearing tea, the mood shifted. Bill Lin, now convinced of the map’s worth, braced for escalated bidding—unaware the staged performance aimed to bleed his coffers dry.

As Old Wu poured, Zhang De noted the trembling hands and overbright smile. The trap was set.

“A curious flavor,” Bill Lin remarked after sipping. “Almost…sour?”

Old Wu’s chuckle held nervous triumph. “A touch of honey in the brew—an old trick to enhance fortune during negotiations.”

The game was afoot.
