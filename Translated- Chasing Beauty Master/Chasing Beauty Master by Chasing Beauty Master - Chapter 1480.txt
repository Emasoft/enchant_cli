Wang Jun coldly glanced at Magistrate Pang and said, “Observing your magistrate’s office, its management appears rather lacking. When our young master arrived, you dared put on such airs, taking an eternity to appear. What exactly is your meaning? Our lord is now deeply displeased and prepares to depart immediately.”

Inside the carriage, Guan Yu remained unseen, intent on observing the other party’s reactions. Maintaining an air of authority was crucial—no flaws could be revealed.

Magistrate Pang protested with an aggrieved expression, “Ah, I beg Lord Jiang’s forgiveness! Truly, I had no confirmation it was truly Your Lordship who arrived. Without prior notice or messengers, I feared impersonators might—”

Wang Jun found himself momentarily at a loss. If one came, one came—what need was there for “prior notice”?

From the carriage, Guan Yu interjected, “Magistrate Pang, my visit concerns no official matters. Thus, no advance notice was sent. I merely traveled here while sightseeing. If my sudden arrival displeases you, Xiaojun—let us depart.”

Guan Yu understood well: when officials visited regions, advance notice was customary, allowing underlings time to prepare gifts and proper receptions. Yet his unannounced arrival could hardly be held against them.

Magistrate Pang hastily implored, “Ah, Lord Jiang must not take offense! Your presence places this humble official in great distress. Since you have already come, please grace my humble residence with your presence. Allow me to atone for this discourtesy.”

“Young Master,” Wang Jun deliberately suggested, “Magistrate Pang’s sincerity seems genuine. Having traveled half the day, perhaps we should rest here awhile.”

Though initially displeased by this attendant, Magistrate Pang’s expression brightened. “This young brother speaks wisely! I implore Lord Jiang to grant me this chance at redemption. Having journeyed so far, permit me to fulfill my duties as host.”

Silence lingered within the carriage. Guan Yu deliberately paused, observing the magistrate’s expression through the window cracks. The man appeared earnest thus far, perhaps only half-convinced of Guan Yu’s identity—but that sufficed.

“Very well,” Guan Yu finally declared. “I shall rest here briefly. My apologies for troubling you.”

“No trouble at all!” Magistrate Pang effused. “Your esteemed presence demands the warmest reception.” Yet inwardly, his doubts simmered—he had not even glimpsed the carriage’s occupant.

When Guan Yu emerged, his resplendent robes and noble bearing erased most suspicions. Only true aristocracy carried such poise. Beaming obsequiously, Magistrate Pang ordered, “Why stand gaping? Assist Lord Jiang at once!”

Wang Jun interposed, “Unnecessary. My lord abhors being touched by others. I shall attend him.” Placing the footstool, he helped Guan Yu descend with ceremonial care.

Alighting, Guan Yu straightened his posture, determined to project superior authority. As the son of an official several ranks above Magistrate Pang, imperial bearing was essential.

**Chapter 3858: A Plea for Calm**

“Lord Jiang, please honor my humble hall!” Magistrate Pang urged, ushering them inside.

Guan Yu strode wordlessly ahead, Wang Jun suppressing laughter behind. This Guan Yu embodied roles flawlessly—first deceiving Old Master Li, now beguiling the magistrate.

Escorted to the study—the office’s most refined chamber—Magistrate Pang fawned, “Your Lordship must be wearied and hungry. Allow me to summon a meal.”

Wang Jun interjected, “Unnecessary. My lord’s fastidiousness requires meals prepared solely by me. Direct me to your kitchens.”

Though inwardly vexed by these “fastidious” demands, the magistrate acquiesced. Guan Yu nodded approval—Wang Jun’s improvisation allowed kitchen reconnaissance while securing a meal, timely given their missed lunch.

As the magistrate pressed with unctuous inquiries—“How fares Lord Jiang Senior recently?”—Guan Yu deflected gracefully until steering conversation to purpose: “Magistrate Pang, why does this town appear so desolate? Upon entering, I found streets empty, townsfolk wary and unresponsive. What plagues this place?”

The magistrate sighed dramatically. “Ah, Lord Jiang! Strange men recently appeared, abducting women to the mountains. Whispers speak of mountain demons. The people live in terror.”

Guan Yu’s gaze hardened. “As local guardian, how dare you neglect this? Why no rescue efforts?”

“I tried, my lord!” Pang protested. “But those mountain fiends overpowered my men. Leading troops myself, we retreated after losing a dozen soldiers. What else could be done?”

“Such strength?” Guan Yu feigned skepticism, though Pang’s tale held plausible details. Yet last night’s mountain foray revealed no such threats.

“I’ve petitioned for reinforcements, but none arrived. I cannot waste lives recklessly,” Pang lamented.

Guan Yu nodded gravely. “Had I known, I’d have brought my Qujiang City guards to purge these vermin. But tonight, we rest here—surely your compound remains secure?”

“Absolutely! My men will safeguard Your Lordship with their lives!” Pang vowed, his earnestness unreadable.

After dining, Guan Yu retired to spacious quarters—sparsely furnished but clean. Wang Jun reconnoitered, finding the rear courtyard’s suspicious woodpile—freshly stacked over where nighttime revelries had echoed. Magistrate Pang’s claim of “drying firewood” rang hollow, yet direct challenges proved futile.

**Chapter 3859: Proceeding as Planned**

Guan Yu resolved to investigate after dark. When Wang Jun fretted over missing dinner with Liu Yun, Guan Yu assured their return. Come evening, Wang Jun announced their departure to visit “Madam Liu Yun—a distant relative of Lord Jiang’s household.”

Magistrate Pang startled—he knew Liu Yun’s late husband, a former captain. Protesting safety concerns, he offered entertainers instead. Wang Jun insisted, prompting Pang’s hidden fury: “Arrogant lackey! Riding his master’s coattails!”

Yet arrangements were made. As they departed, Pang silently prayed no mishaps would befall his “esteemed guest”—his career depended on it.
