However, he was not entirely empty-handed.

At the very least, he now understood that Guan Yu knew far more about their affairs than ordinary, and that Guan Yu was more formidable than he had imagined.

He got into the car and ordered the bodyguard driving in front, “No matter what methods you use, I want every dirty secret of Jia Ren and his people by tonight. Station men to watch his wife and children around the clock. At the slightest sign of trouble, kidnap them immediately. Understood?”

“Understood,” the bodyguard replied gravely.

“Hmph. Just a policeman. I refuse to believe you’d prioritize duty over your family,” Cheng Gui said with a sinister smile.

He added, “Also, contact Chu Hong. Tell her Guan Yu has arrived, and she can make her move. Can’t stand the sight of that brat. Serves him right to die early—hahaha!” Cheng Gui laughed maniacally inside the car.

In the teahouse private room, only two remained: Guan Yu and Xiao Xiong.

By the window, they brewed tea and admired the snowscape, appearing utterly carefree, unperturbed by the precarious situation.

“With Director Jia’s assistance, Cheng Gui will have to think twice before pulling any tricks,” Xiao Xiong remarked with a smile.

Guan Yu sipped his tea and nodded. “Though we’ve gained Jia’s support, given Cheng Gui’s methods, a mere police chief won’t pose much threat to him.”

“The threat may be small, but it buys us time,” Xiao Xiong agreed. “I’ll send men to watch Jia’s family to ensure their safety.”

Guan Yu shook his head. “If Cheng Gui dared flaunt his intentions, he’s prepared for Jia’s retaliation. Protecting his family might prove futile—Cheng Gui and Jia would anticipate such moves. I fear he’ll find other ways to control Jia.”

Xiao Xiong frowned slightly. He understood the adage: walk long by the river, and eventually your shoes get wet.

“We still lack sufficient leverage,” Guan Yu sighed.

“At least it’s a good start,” Xiao Xiong said with a smile. “What’s next?”

“Visit the deputy mayor,” Guan Yu replied casually. “Another question—can Mo Kai withstand Hanhai’s offensive?”

“Broadly manageable. With sufficient funds, I can turn the tide and make Hanhai yours,” Xiao Xiong declared confidently.

Guan Yu massaged his temples. “Money again. Where to get it?”

“Where there’s a will, there’s a way. This can’t be rushed,” Xiao Xiong consoled.

Guan Yu sniffed. “Arrange a meeting with the deputy mayor?”

“No need. His birthday banquet is in two days—a dance party. I’m an invited guest,” Xiao Xiong said.

“Puzzles me—how does a gangster mingle with high society?” Guan Yu teased.

Xiao Xiong rolled his eyes. “Gangsters bully the weak and deal drugs. Have I ever done such things? With my status as Mo Kai’s chairman, I go wherever I please.”

“Anywhere?” Guan Yu eyed him with a lecherous grin.

“Still can’t visit certain places as a bachelor,” Xiao Xiong retorted with a laugh before turning serious. “You’re certain Cheng Gui and Zhou Jin conspire?”

“Absolutely,” Guan Yu confirmed.

“Your plan?”

“Watch the tigers fight from the safety of the mountain,” Guan Yu smirked cunningly.

Xiao Xiong looked perplexed.

As Guan Yu leisurely sipped tea, others in the building felt less tranquil.

“Mom, why must you meddle in this?” A stunning beauty with flawless porcelain skin and delicate features glared at the woman opposite her.

The forty-year-old with the complexion of a thirty-year-old possessed an oval face, phoenix eyes, willow-leaf brows, and glossy lips. Dressed in a silver office suit, her curvaceous figure exuded mature charm.

It was hard to believe this woman had a daughter in her twenties. Their presence drew covetous stares from male patrons, who ignored their female companions’ death glares to admire the “sisters.”

The matriarch ignored the gazes. “Had I not come, you wouldn’t either. I know you too well.”

The younger woman pouted. “Mom, I’m naturally beautiful with countless suitors. Must you lower your standards to arrange blind dates?”

“You’re not getting younger. In two years, you’ll be leftover goods. I want grandchildren!” the mother retorted. “Trust my judgment—this man can make Lingling happy.”

“I’ll find my own happiness!” The daughter stood abruptly. “Bathroom break.”

“No escaping this,” the mother warned.

“I know!” The daughter hurried off.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu exited his private room and froze mid-step upon spotting the matriarch.

“Mo Ling? Why’s she here?”

Chapter 629: Mom!

The world works in strange ways—people often collide unexpectedly.

Guan Yu chose avoidance. Mo Ling’s mercurial temperament—princessy, childish, neurotic—made interactions volatile. Their encounters always ended in friction, and currently overwhelmed with tasks, he sought no quarrel.

Yet fate intervened.

As Guan Yu glanced at “Mo Ling,” their eyes met. He awkwardly scratched his head and told Xiao Xiong, “Ran into a friend. I’ll catch up later.”

Xiao Xiong followed his gaze and sighed jokingly, “With your charm, no wonder I’m single. Meet me at Mo Kai afterward.”

Approaching the table, Guan Yu’s smile faded when “Mo Ling” ignored him.

“Teacher Mo, fancy meeting you here,” he said, sitting uninvited.

The woman looked up coolly. “You’ve mistaken me for someone else.”

Guan Yu’s smile stiffened. “How could I forget my teacher and neighbor? We’ve shared meals and even a bed!”

The woman’s cheeks flushed. “How dare you!”

“That night we slept together, wasn’t I a perfect gentleman?” Guan Yu pressed, frustrated by her pretense.

“Scoundrel!” she hissed, chest heaving.

As Guan Yu prepared to leave, a familiar voice called, “Mom! Is he here?”

He turned to see the real Mo Ling—and froze.

“Mom!?”

Chapter 630: He’s My Boyfriend

Life’s ironies unfolded.

Staring at the carbon-copy mother-daughter pair, Guan Yu realized his blunder. Mo Ling’s eyes widened. “Guan Yu? What are you doing here?”

“Apparently mistaking your mother for you,” Guan Yu muttered, noting the older woman’s icy demeanor.

“Sit!” Mo Ling insisted, tugging his sleeve.

“I really should go—”

“Would you abandon your girlfriend and future mother-in-law?” Mo Ling interjected, clinging to his arm.

Guan Yu gaped. The matriarch paled.

“Mom, this is my boyfriend, Guan Yu,” Mo Ling announced sweetly. “Aren’t you staying to chat?”

Before Guan Yu could refute, Mo Ling whispered lethally, “Don’t you dare deny responsibility after what happened in bed!”
