“Leaving you? My heart is filled with helplessness and confusion. Everything feels chaotic,” Guan Yu thought gloomily.

“Who said anything about leaving? This is our little nest—I’m not going anywhere! Besides, sleeping in your arms these past few days has been so comfortable and reassuring. I’d definitely get insomnia without you!” Du Xiaojuan tilted her head sweetly, hugging Guan Yu’s arm as she gazed up at him with an ingratiating smile.

Everything settled into calm. Luo Cheng and his motorcycle gang brothers busied themselves managing the three storefront businesses. After a peaceful Sunday spent with Niu Le, Guan Yu, and Du Xiaojuan, the trio took a taxi back to school early Monday morning.

When they had initially dropped out, they hadn’t even bothered to request leave—they’d simply left. Fortunately, they hadn’t taken their luggage and bedding then, making this return much more convenient.

The campus felt familiar as ever. Groups of students flocked toward the cafeteria at dawn, while others exercised on the sports field, creating a fresh and lively atmosphere.

“Senior, head back to the dorm first. Let’s meet at the school gate after noon classes,” Guan Yu instructed Du Xiaojuan.

“Mhm… I’ll call you if anything happens. Don’t worry!” Du Xiaojuan nodded obediently. She knew how deeply Guan Yu cared for her, and his protectiveness only made her happier—it felt wonderful to be cherished.

As Du Xiaojuan skipped back to her dorm, Guan Yu turned to Niu Le. “Let’s go.” They headed toward their own dorm building. After over half a month away, Guan Yu wondered how their roommates were faring. He chuckled inwardly, imagining their stunned expressions when he and Niu Le reappeared.

Yet when they pushed open their dorm door, both froze.

Four people occupied the room—two strangers sat on the beds, arranging their bedding.

“Guan Yu! Niu Le! You’re back?” Tian Hao looked up, his face lighting up as he hurried to greet them.

“Yeah… Who are these two?” Guan Yu asked, eyeing the boys sitting on his and Niu Le’s beds.

“Ugh, don’t ask! The dorm supervisor assigned them here. After finding out you dropped out, that bastard’s been ‘taking special care’ of us freshmen—practically driving us to despair!” Tian Hao explained bitterly.

Guan Yu nodded. Noting the newcomers’ nervous expressions, he smiled casually. “Don’t worry. This isn’t your fault.” Freshmen shouldn’t bully fellow freshmen. He sat on Tian Hao’s bed while Wang Zhen squeezed next to Niu Le.

“Tian Hao said you struck it rich? A freaking villa? Damn! How’d you become a millionaire overnight?” Wang Zhen grabbed Guan Yu’s arm in amazement.

Guan Yu smiled without elaboration. Tian Hao must have spread exaggerated tales.

“Actually, it’s good they’re here. Niu Le and I were planning to move out anyway. Oh, and we’re resuming classes,” Guan Yu announced casually, slapping his thigh.

Chapter 243: Come to My Dorm?

“What? You’re staying?” Wang Zhen exclaimed.

Guan Yu shrugged. Tian Hao pumped his fist. “Awesome! Now we’ve got our backbone back! That damn supervisor only bullies us because you left. You need to teach him a lesson!”

Even the newcomers nodded eagerly. Clearly, the supervisor had become universally hated.

“What’s he done?” Guan Yu asked.

“Fines for every minor offense! Even checks for skipped classes! That bastard’s chummy with upperclassmen thugs. We’re all too scared to protest,” Tian Hao grumbled.

“He makes us treat him like royalty—greeting him bowing, taking turns buying him meals! We’re broke students!” Wang Zhen added.

Expecting Guan Yu’s outrage, the group was surprised when he simply chuckled. “Ignore him. He won’t dare start a brawl.”

By 8:20 AM, when Guan Yu’s group entered the classroom, their advisor Liu Shilei froze mid-task, staring in shock.

“Teacher, I’m back,” Guan Yu stated calmly, ignoring classmates’ stares.

Liu Shilei composed herself. “You two—come with me.” She led them to a stairwell window. “You’re really staying?”

“Yes.”

“Good. I’ll handle the paperwork. Attend class now.” Hesitating, she added, “Come to my dorm for lunch.”

Niu Le choked on his spit, coughing violently before fleeing. Liu Shilei blushed. “He didn’t know about us?”

“Never told him,” Guan Yu admitted.

“You vanished for weeks—no calls, nothing! I thought you’d forgotten your teacher… and me.” Her voice softened.

“How could I? I dreamt of your scent every night,” Guan Yu teased.

Blushing, she swatted him. “Flatterer. Meet me at the office after class then.”

Returning to the classroom, Guan Yu surveyed his classmates. Art schools never lacked beauties—rows of fresh-faced girls made lectures pass swiftly.

During break, Niu Le suddenly lunged at Guan Yu’s desk. “Master! Teach me your ways with women!”

The entire class turned as Niu Le bellowed: “I want girls to chase me too!”

“I don’t know you!” Guan Yu hissed, ducking.

Nearby, a ponytailed girl sneered to her delicate friend: “Who are these clowns?”

“Probably those dropouts. First time in class—no punishment either.”

“That big oaf looks brainless.”

The delicate girl, a fox-featured beauty, chided her: “Lili, don’t be mean.”

Hearing this, Guan Yu turned. “Talking about us, ladies?”

“Who’s your lady? Look at yourself!” Ponytail—Fu Lili—snapped.

Guan Yu noted her companion’s striking features—a petite frame, sharp chin, and luminous eyes like a storybook vixen. But he simply shrugged and left with his friends.

“Think she’s so great with her rich boyfriend,” Wang Zhen muttered outside. “Treats him like a slave.”

Fu Lili’s voice suddenly rang out behind them: “Move, mutts! Good dogs don’t block paths!”

She stood arms akimbo, deliberately provoking.
