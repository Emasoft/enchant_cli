However, the Duan family had outright rejected this marriage proposal. The reason was Tang Muchen's notorious reputation in the capital. His fame stemmed not from business acumen or clan management, but from his womanizing ways. The Duans had bluntly stated they'd never let their precious daughter marry such an unreliable man.

From that day, Tang Muchen tried every approach but achieved nothing. He couldn't even secure a meeting with Duan Ruxue. After repeated failures, he eventually gave up. Though the Duan family's dismissive tone rankled the Tangs, the two clans had always maintained a policy of non-interference, leaving little room for negotiation.

Today's encounter with Duan Ruxue felt like a dream come true for Tang Muchen. Being invited to this private chamber, alone with her in such an intimate atmosphere, filled him with exhilaration and nervous anticipation.

"Consider your explanation sufficient for now. I'll reluctantly forgive you this time," Duan Ruxue said before steering the conversation. "By the way, have you heard about the major incidents in the capital? Particularly the Cao family affairs?"

Tang Muchen nodded. "Of course. I recently learned the Cao's gambling den, tavern, and fabric store all suffered catastrophic closures. Quite the turmoil."

"Perhaps the heavens frown upon their misdeeds. That fabric store was perfectly fine, yet a sudden blaze consumed not only the entire stock but also spread to neighboring buildings," he continued.

"Do you truly believe it accidental?" Duan Ruxue countered. "Why would three establishments face disasters in quick succession? This reeks of deliberate scheming."

"Catching your implication..." Tang Muchen leaned forward. "...you suspect arson? Impossible! Witnesses reported no intruders. Their high perimeter walls make undetected entry implausible."

He added, "The Caos maintain extreme vigilance given their numerous enemies. Who could possibly possess such capability, Miss Duan?"

"The perpetrator's identity eludes me," she replied, sipping tea delicately. "But consider this—I've heard Patriarch Cao recently visited the Qin residence for secret discussions. What urgent matter would drive him there now?"

Tang Muchen's expression tightened. The four great clans had previously flirted with alliances until imperial intervention halted such machinations. Initially spearheaded by the Caos, their proposed coalition with the Qins could have dominated the capital, challenging even the Second Prince's influence.

Emperor's decree had forbidden territorial disputes or mergers between clans within the imperial city. United, the Cao-Qin alliance could have threatened royal authority itself—a risk the throne couldn't tolerate.

"Though never formally allied, the Cao and Qin families have collaborated on shadow projects for years," Tang Muchen acknowledged. "We ignored them as long as our interests remained untouched."

"Precisely why we must prepare," Duan Ruxue insisted. "If Cao seeks Qin's support in retaliation, our families require covert cooperation. United, we can withstand their assault."

Tang Muchen studied her intently. "A secret alliance? Should this leak, it gives Cao perfect pretext to attack."

"Will you cower while they plot our demise?" Her voice sharpened. "Without preparations, how shall we counter their combined forces?"

After pensive silence, Tang conceded, "The Cao losses, while substantial, seem insufficient for drastic measures. Identifying the culprit should resolve matters."

"You underestimate their vindictiveness," Duan Ruxue warned. "With no perpetrator found, they'll blame us first. United with the Qins, they'll strike when we're most vulnerable."

As their discussion deepened, strategic plans took shape. Unknown to them, distant figures moved through the capital's shadows—a wealthy young master exposing gambling frauds here, incited riots there. These calculated strikes against Cao interests would soon ripple through all four great clans, testing loyalties and ambitions in the emperor's watchful shadow.
