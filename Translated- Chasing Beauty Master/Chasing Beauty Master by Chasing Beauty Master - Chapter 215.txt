After a long silence, Guan Yu spoke. "Thank you."

"That phrase loses sincerity when overused." Li Xi clearly wished to change the subject.

Guan Yu wasn't the sentimental type. Gratitude could be expressed in countless ways - a single verbal acknowledgment sufficed, with actions bearing the true weight of appreciation.

His honest smile creased his weathered face. "From what just happened, Wan Qianshan (Ten Thousand Mountains) clearly values face above all. You've thoroughly humiliated him today. He won't let this rest. You should leave N City immediately."

Li Xi's gaze swept over him like winter moonlight. "Haven't you already planned retaliation? I'll stay to witness whether a powerful dragon can defeat a local snake."

Guan Yu's lips twitched. This dangerously perceptive woman had dissected his intentions completely. "I won't deny it," he nodded. "No mangy dog like Wan Qianshan gets to piss on my territory. Since he failed to break me today, I'll break him instead."

Taking a sip of wine, Li Xi fell silent. She knew Guan Yu's past and present - this was no man to suffer insults lightly. His infamous clash over Feng Xin's honor proved that. Today's humiliation demanded blood repayment.

Guan Yu retrieved his phone and dialed Police Chief Nie openly. The hotel shooting with bullet-marked walls constituted a major incident requiring police attention. Though they'd left quickly, security cameras would capture them. His dual-purpose call served both to avoid interrogation and frame Wan Qianshan for attempted murder with illegal firearms.

Justice's scalpel and the underworld's cleaver - Guan Yu would wield both. After instructing Nie, he called Feng Xin to locate Wan Qianshan's hideout. Ending the calls, his smile mirrored a stalking lion awaiting prey.

"Will the police truly aid you?" Li Xi murmured.

Guan Yu flashed white teeth. "Chief Nie understands pragmatic choices."

Li Xi's appraising glance spoke volumes - here stood a master of calculated schemes, presenting Nie with an ultimatum disguised as a request.

......

In the police chief's office, Nie paced like caged tiger after hanging up. Guan Yu's dilemma forced him to balance career against underworld alliances. Wan Qianshan's "Godfather of Taiwan" status promised bureaucratic tempests if pursued, yet abandoning Guan Yu meant losing N City's shadow ruler.

Chain-smoking against habit, nicotine clarity hardened his resolve. He summoned Captain Wang. "We've received intel about an attempted murder at Haodi Hotel. Suspect is Wan Qianshan. Mobilize immediately."

As Wang departed, Nie lit another cigarette. "May this choice prove wise."

......

At Hi!Bar on Central Avenue, midday silence shattered under Wan Qianshan's rampage. The cowering owner watched his establishment destroyed without protest. Only stone-faced Huang Ming dared approach the storm.

"Your dossier, Mountain Brother."

Wan Qianshan collapsed onto an intact sofa, scanning documents with thunderous expression. "Your assessment, Huang Ming?"

"Guan Yu's formidable. Uninjured, I'd struggle against him. His reputation demands caution."

Wan Qianshan's nod carried death sentence finality. "The boy exceeds expectations - N City's underworld bows to his shadow. He's an unacceptable variable."

"Understood."

"Use the footsoldiers. Keep your hands clean." Wan Qianshan's glance at the trembling bar owner clarified the unspoken - collateral damage meant nothing.

"And the woman dies too."

......

Five thirty-fifth chapter: Li Xi's Capture

Humiliation scalded Wan Qianshan's pride. Five motionless minutes in the crime scene corridor preceded his retreat. Learning about the fake police bluff ignited volcanic fury - outwitted by a woman!

His phone's survival proved fortunate when the call came. Before retaliation, Guan Yu's dual-front assault began - police warrants and underworld hunts converging.

"Fleeting victory!" Wan Qianshan spat, fleeing toward L City in armored vehicles. "My return shall be your extinction!"

......

Guan Yu scowled at his phone. "The old fox slipped our nets."

"Expected," Li Xi shrugged. "His 'Godfather' title wasn't ceremonial."

"He'll pay doubly next time," Guan Yu vowed. "When are you returning to Beijing?"

"Project details require finalization. The research laboratory stays here. Expect a busy week."

Guan Yu blinked. "Beijing offers better resources."

"Land costs triple. Talent follows funding." Li Xi's wine shimmered as she swirled the glass. "Bureaucratic approvals here take days, not months. Your... local influence ensures smooth processing."

Guan Yu's chuckle acknowledged his underworld leverage. "Funding?"

"Xinyu Capital provides 500 million. Lasts three months. Total requirement - 2 billion initially."

"I'll secure the remainder."

"1.5 billion isn't petty cash."

Guan Yu's grin held dangerous promise. "I have methods."

As Li Xi departed his villa, she noted multiple feminine presences without comment. Professional distance mattered more than romantic entanglements.

......

Campus night air carried liquor's warmth as Guan Yu wandered contentedly... until the text:

"Li Xi's ours. Come alone to Tongda Factory or she dies."

Five thirty-sixth chapter: The Bomb

Guan Yu's call met dead air. The second attempt brought leering malice: "Confirming your whore's alive?"

A slap crackled through the receiver before Li Xi's calm warning: "It's a trap. Bomb vest. Don't-"

"Shut your mouth, bitch!" The kidnapper's laughter grated. "Ten men await to entertain her if you chicken out."

"Which hand struck her?" Guan Yu's voice dropped to subzero.

"Both! And these hands will-"

"I'll sever them at the wrists."
