“If one day I meet a good man like you, brother. Someone who cherishes and loves me like this, I would never let him feel heartbroken or troubled…” Zhao Jing’er said solemnly. Only those who had experienced life and death could truly see through worldly matters. To live happily with a man she loved and who cherished her every day – why bother with other trivialities? If both parties remained unhappy and sorrowful over something, what was the point?... Zhao Jing’er thought to herself secretly.

Guan Yu chuckled and poked her forehead. “You? Wait until you grow up first… What does a little girl like you know about love and romance?”

Zhao Jing’er huffed indignantly. “You’re only a few years older than me!”

Guan Yu raised an eyebrow. “Age isn’t necessarily important. But life experience, understanding of the world, discernment of others, distinguishing good from evil – these are marks of maturity. Do you… have any of that?”

Left speechless, Zhao Jing’er stuck out her tongue at him before flopping onto her pillow, turning her back to him.

Glancing at the digital clock, Guan Yu pulled his chair closer. He lifted the hem of her hospital gown and slid his left hand inside.

“Ah! Brother, what are you doing?” Zhao Jing’er exclaimed, her face flushing crimson as she turned from contemplating his stories to this sudden intrusion.

Her skin remained cool as jade, fingertips gliding over her abdomen feeling like brushing against ice.

“Using my cultivation to heal you. What did you think?” Guan Yu retorted gruffly.

Blushing furiously, Zhao Jing’er turned away without another word. The sensation of a man’s hand exploring beneath her clothes, moving upward to cup her soft bosom, made her squirm with embarrassment. She longed to hide under the blankets, yet couldn’t resist this intimate contact.

Oblivious to her turmoil, Guan Yu pressed his palm against her chest and activated his healing technique. Having secretly absorbed a half-sack of sugar from the hospital cafeteria earlier, his energy reserves were replenished.

As warm energy flowed between them, Guan Yu frowned. Hadn’t his abilities upgraded? Why did the healing energy feel different now? The faint blue electric arcs were sparser than before. Could this energy also require replenishment?

Beneath his palm, Zhao Jing’er’s body trembled. The tingling currents stimulated her pink bud until it hardened visibly, pressing against Guan Yu’s middle finger.

In darkness, tactile senses heighten. Though Guan Yu couldn’t see, his fingers mapped every detail. The unexpected firmness beneath his touch made his throat tighten. How he longed to pinch and play with that pert nub!

Yet he restrained himself. After half a minute, as energy waned, he withdrew his hand – then instinctively brought it to his nose. Remembering last time’s lingering milky fragrance, he aborted the motion. Too late – Zhao Jing’er saw everything.

“You…” Her face burned crimson as she turned away.

Guan Yu mentally kicked himself. Lighting a cigarette, he sat awkwardly until Zhao Jing’er’s squirming broke the silence.

“Brother… help me?” she pleaded softly.

“What’s wrong?” His pulse quickened.

“I’m so itchy… Can’t reach. Scratch my back?” She presented her slender shoulders.

The anticlimax nearly made Guan Yu laugh. Suppressing improper thoughts, he slid his hand under her gown.

“Left… higher… lower…” she directed until Guan Yu playfully raked his nails across her entire back.

“All better! Thank you, brother.” She smiled shyly, unaware how her arched posture accentuated her curves.

“Any time,” Guan Yu replied hoarsely, smoke curling from his lips.

When conversation lapsed, Zhao Jing’er asked excitedly, “When do we leave? I’ve never been outside!”

“Whenever your grandfather arranges. You’re healed enough.”

Her eyes sparkled. “Please convince him not to send bodyguards! I want normal life – attend school with you!”

Guan Yu hesitated. “But your safety…”

“You’ll protect me!” She clasped his hand. “Let me live in your villa! I’ll help manage your finances – I’m excellent at investments!”

Though dubious of her claims, Guan Yu eventually yielded. That evening, Old Master Zhao reluctantly agreed after seeing his granddaughter’s determination.

“She’ll enroll in your university,” the patriarch decided. “Staying by your side daily eases my worries.”

Thus preparations began for their journey – Zhao Jing’er’s first step into the wider world, and Guan Yu’s unwitting descent into deeper entanglement with this fragile yet determined girl whose presence awakened both protective instincts and dangerous temptations.
