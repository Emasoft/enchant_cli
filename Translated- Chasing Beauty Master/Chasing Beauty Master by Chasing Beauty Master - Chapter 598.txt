After finishing his words, Elder Griffon glanced at the stage with a smile and said to Huo Lingling, "Miss Lingling, since you lack qualification for the challenge tournament, all three of you must leave. This match will not continue."

After being reprimanded, Wu Yuying's heart swelled with grievance. Pouting her small mouth, she coldly addressed Guan Yu, "You coward. If you're truly a man, I hope next time we meet you won't be hiding behind women." With these words, Wu Yuying vanished from sight, though everyone sensed this matter wouldn't end here. Sooner or later, Guan Yu would face Wu Yuying's vengeance!

However, no one dwelled on this. Seeing the situation finally resolved, Elder Griffon sighed in relief. Glancing at the somewhat helpless Guan Yu, he said, "Boy, there shouldn't be any more disturbances now, right?" He then scanned the audience below as if issuing a warning. "Though the tournament rules are clear to all, every year people deliberately violate them. This time, Hu Xiaohai used forbidden elixirs - I shall deal with this severely. Let future participants take heed!"

The crowd remained silent, knowing the enraged elder shouldn't be provoked. When Guan Yu descended the stage, all stared at him with envy and resentment. Not only did this youth possess extraordinary talent, but he also enjoyed the company of the sect's most beautiful and powerful women. To live such a life, one could die content!

With Guan Yu setting an impossibly high standard, subsequent challenges seemed mundane - until Huo Lingling's appearance caused a stir. Everyone wondered how powerful this genius girl daring enough to challenge Wu Yuying truly was. She didn't disappoint. No ordinary cultivator could withstand three moves from her, sending chills down spines. Was she another monster?

The tournament lasted eight hours from dawn till dusk, with Guan Yu and Huo Lingling emerging as undisputed victors. After their matches, they descended to find Huo Lingling gazing at Guan Yu's calm demeanor. "Brother Guan Yu," she said happily, "I never imagined you'd be so formidable today! You truly startled me!"

Guan Yu rolled his eyes. "How shameless! Don't forget today's true star was you, daring to provoke that she-devil Wu Yuying. If I'm not mistaken, you've reached Advanced Mage level?"

Huo Lingling's silence confirmed his guess, deepening Guan Yu's astonishment. For a teenage girl to attain Advanced Mage status after three years of cultivation - a height many lifelong practitioners never reach!

When discussing magical skills, Huo Lingling mysteriously whispered in his ear, "Brother Guan Yu, I possess several Mysterious Tier skill tomes. Interested?"

Guan Yu looked puzzled. "Where did you obtain these?" He knew magical skills' preciousness - major sects considered themselves fortunate to possess a dozen, mostly Yellow Tier. Mysterious and Earth Tier skills were phoenix feathers and qilin horns. That a girl like Huo Lingling privately owned multiple Mysterious Tier scrolls shocked everyone.

Declining with a smile, Guan Yu said, "I'll wait to learn the sect's internal skills."

Pouting, Huo Lingling retorted, "Hmph! Why treat me this way?" She offered no explanation, merely smiling.

Post-tournament, Guan Yu's life slowed. Discovering his cultivation elixirs from the grand auction were nearly depleted, he decided against repurchasing. Three reasons: his enhanced cultivation rendered low-tier elixirs ineffective; over-reliance hindered future progress; constant strain without rest reduced efficiency. Most crucially - he was broke.

Only now did Guan Yu sigh: "Wealth truly reigns supreme."

Thus, he spent days accompanying Huo Lingling shopping, arousing widespread envy. None dared protest - the former "waste" now shone as Mixed Heaven Sect's brightest star, commanding respect from all.

During solitary cultivation, Guan Yu spotted a familiar figure - Wu Yuying. Since Guan Yu crippled Hu Xiaohai, she'd sought revenge. Predictably, she appeared when Guan Yu ventured alone.

"Well now! If it isn't Miss Wu? Come to watch my training?"

Her face flushed crimson at his mocking tone. "You little bastard! Were it not for your cruelty, my brother wouldn't lie bedridden for half a month! Today I'll avenge him - you'll learn not to trifle with us!"

Guan Yu remained unperturbed, never doubting his actions. Why apologize when faultless?

His attitude further enraged Wu Yuying. "Dare you defy me? Have no fear?"

"Fear? Why? Because you attended some third-rate academy? Think two years' training makes you invincible? Let me tell you - that doesn't work here! Why protect your lackey post-match? Is Hu Xiaohai human while I'm not? Ridiculous!"

Strangely, Guan Yu's usually calm demeanor shattered around Wu Yuying, his agitation evident to all.

"Guan Yu! One more word and you'll regret it forever!" Wu Yuying shouted.

"Ha! I'd like to see what could make me regret!" Guan Yu remained unfazed, amused by her anger.

Finally provoked beyond reason, Wu Yuying leapt from a massive boulder, charging furiously. Knowing direct confrontation favored her, Guan Yu dodged, appearing behind her. Though surprised, Wu Yuying sneered: "Fool! Think yourself my match? This isn't naivety - it's stupidity!"

Ignoring taunts, Guan Yu focused - her contempt presented opportunity. Yet bridging their power gap required perfect timing and luck.

As Wu Yuying launched another kick, Guan Yu suddenly unleashed stored spiritual energy. Caught off-guard, Wu Yuying crashed heavily. Stunned by defeat, she froze - granting Guan Yu his chance. Pouncing like a starving wolf, he pinned her down, surrounding her with an inexplicable aura.

"Where's your arrogance now?" Guan Yu laughed. Finding herself immobilized, Wu Yuying ceased struggling, silent tears falling. Sensing danger, Guan Yu released her and fled as her scream echoed.

Watching him vanish, Wu Yuying's fury peaked. Had he remained, she'd have torn him apart. Not only had she failed to avenge her brother, but been humiliated - intolerable for her proud nature.

Approaching his quarters, Guan Yu spotted a familiar figure. "Lingling? Why here?"

Huo Lingling studied him thoughtfully. "Brother Guan Yu... did you provoke Wu Yuying again?"

"Why ask?"

"I saw her storming from the woods. In Mixed Heaven Sect, only you could enrage her so."

Flushing, Guan Yu chuckled. "Don't tease me. I'm not that wicked. Who'd willingly provoke that she-devil?"

"Truly? Whether honest or not, I'll say this - though temperamental, Wu Yuying has good intentions. Please be magnanimous. Can you?"

Guan Yu nodded. "If she stops troubling me, I'll ignore her."

Watching his obedient act, Huo Lingling giggled, then pouted. "Since when did you become so glib?"

Changing subjects, she added, "The Gathering Qi Hall's annual opening approaches. Qualified disciples may select suitable magic scrolls. Are you prepared?"

Guan Yu grew serious. His cultivation bottleneck required magical skills beyond basic energy training - necessitating scrolls he couldn't afford. Common Yellow Tier scrolls sold for over 10,000 gold - astronomical for his empty purse. Worse, Yellow Tier skills now proved inadequate. He needed higher tiers.

Two days later at Gathering Qi Hall, crowds of elite disciples who passed initial tests gathered. Guan Yu entered to find numerous boxes labeled with elemental affiliations - Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth. His gaze lingered on a Wood element box until a violet-clad figure appeared.

"Lingling? Shouldn't you be at Water element?"

Blushing, Huo Lingling replied, "Though specializing in Water, I've studied Wood's affinities. I hope to find a Mysterious Tier Wood skill tome - broaden my horizons and understand your cultivation better."

Guan Yu marveled - mastering multiple elements under twenty was rare, limited mostly to elders. Among youths, only they achieved this.

A light tap on his head from Huo Lingling broke his reverie. "Stop daydreaming! We've only an hour before scrolls vanish. Hurry!"

Passing Fire element boxes, Guan Yu discovered a deep cavern with entry marks. Turning to Huo Lingling, he warned, "Follow me. The interior's treacherous for the inexperienced."

Nodding, she followed into widening tunnels lined with azure energy waves hiding scrolls. Newcomers immediately attacked the barriers, creating explosions that left the waves intact - to their dismay.

"Want to try?" Huo Lingling whispered.

Guan Yu shook his head. "These guard Yellow Tier skills. I seek higher grades."

"Agreed. Choosing these would forfeit better opportunities."

"How much time? We must find better within half an hour!"
