“I’ve studied lock-picking since childhood,” Guan Yu continued. “No lock is a challenge to me. Without exaggeration, any lock in this world placed before me can be opened.”



**Chapter 4811: A Woman’s Heart**



The lock here was merely a ornate shell—its mechanism laughably simple. Back in China, Guan Yu could crack even high-security door locks, let alone such primitive ones.



By modern Chinese standards, critical installations had long abandoned traditional locks in favor of advanced technology: password systems, fingerprint scans, facial recognition. Such innovations were nonexistent here.



Though such skills might raise suspicions—after all, only thieves typically mastered them—Guan Yu’s talents defied easy categorization.



Jiang Yuan Kai remarked, “Brother Wan’s versatility astounds me. Though I didn’t witness it myself, I heard how you felled those soldiers in an instant. Such prowess is rare. My admiration grows by the minute.”



“You flatter me, Brother Jiang,” Guan Yu replied with a chuckle. “My actions today were rash, spurred by your daughter’s provocations. I beg your forgiveness.”



“It’s my unruly child who should apologize,” Jiang sighed. “When she heard Chu Fan was performing at Hongyan Theater tonight, she became desperate to attend. Restraining her took Herculean effort. That girl lacks all decorum—she’s shamed this family.”



“You should understand youth’s passions,” Guan Yu countered. “I admire Miss Jiang’s boldness in love. Were I in her place, I’d chase romance too.”



“That ability you displayed earlier—flying back with Xin’er—was it magic?”



A woman’s voice rang through the hall before its owner appeared. Guan Yu turned to see Princess Chang entering. Both men rose as Jiang introduced, “Let me present—”



“No need.” The princess cut him off coldly. “All the capital knows of Master Wan’s grand entrance. How impressive to flit through our estate like a shadow.”



Despite being mother to a daughter Jiang Xin’s age—likely over thirty-five—the princess’s ageless beauty stunned. Her flawless face, untouched by time, could belong to a woman in her twenties.



*The wealthy truly master preservation,* Guan Yu mused. *She’s found the fountain of youth.*



Yet the princess’s displeasure was palpable. Her priorities lay in protecting household dignity and her daughter’s wellbeing, not excuses. After ensuring Jiang Xin’s safety, she’d resolved to confront this interloper.



“I apologize for the disturbance, Your Highness,” Guan Yu offered. “I’ll personally apologize to Miss Jiang.”



Explanations were futile—this lioness defended her cub unconditionally. Her domineering presence overshadowed even her husband, validating rumors of Jiang Yuan Kai’s subservience.



As tension thickened, Jiang broke it with forced levity: “Brother Wan, sit. Women’s minds work differently—pay it no heed.”



The princess finally relented. When seated, Jiang added, “My wife simply lacks context about you. Please overlook her harshness.”



At this, the princess shot him a look but held her tongue. The gift of the Eastern Sea Dragon Pearl demanded some courtesy, even if this stranger had breached their walls.



“Master Wan,” she pressed, “that flight technique—you’re a cultivator?”



Guan Yu’s earlier use of Cloud Azure Sect’s flight art had exposed him. “Your insight serves you well, Princess,” he admitted. “Though I’m no pure cultivator—I walk both paths: martial and mystical.”



Jiang Yuan Kai, who’d kept Guan Yu’s secrets until now, tensed. But Guan Yu nodded permission: “Speak freely, Brother Jiang.”



After dismissing servants, Jiang explained: “Dual cultivation—harnessing both inner energy and spiritual power—hasn’t been seen in a millennium. Those who master it become peerless. Brother Wan’s future is limitless.”



“But doesn’t dual training exhaust one?” the princess asked.



“On the contrary,” Jiang clarified. “Their natural affinity accelerates progress beyond ordinary adepts.”



Reassessed, Guan Yu now seemed a valuable ally rather than threat. The princess’s tone softened: “Your origins, Master Wan? No prominent Wan family exists here.”



Guan Yu hesitated. Jiang interjected: “Must we pry? Every man deserves privacy.”



“Privacy?” The princess arched a brow. “When rumors name him our son-in-law? I’ll ask plainly: What are your intentions toward Xin’er?”



Trapped, Guan Yu floundered: “The gossip is baseless! I’ve known Brother Jiang but two days. Miss Jiang is peerless—any man would be fortunate—”



“Then you admit interest?” she pounced.



Jiang rescued him: “Youth follows its own course. Let’s not force confessions.”



Undeterred, the princess circled back: “Your lineage, Master Wan. Your refinement suggests noble birth.”



When Jiang protested, she retorted: “If he’s to be Xin’er’s match, I’ll know his roots!”



Guan Yu’s mind raced. This interrogation outmatched any lock’s complexity. How had a simple visit spiraled into marital negotiations?



**Chapter 4812: The Dilemma**



Jiang Yuan Kai, ever the mediator, tried levity: “Wife, must you interrogate our guest?”



“Would you rather Xin’er wed that consumptive actor Chu Fan?” the princess snapped. “At least this one has strength!”



Caught between familial politics and his secret mission, Guan Yu realized: Some locks couldn’t be picked—only endured.



**Chapter 4813: Misspoken Words**



The princess’s persistence unveiled deeper designs. Rumors had kindled ambitions beyond Guan Yu’s reckoning. Every demurral now risked greater offense.



“Miss Jiang embodies perfection,” he offered carefully. “But my path leaves no room for attachments.”



The princess leaned forward, eyes glinting. “All paths bend to destiny, Master Wan. Even yours.”



In that moment, Guan Yu understood: The most intricate mechanisms weren’t locks, but the human heart. And this particular puzzle had just begun.
