Guan Yu felt that the inn attendant’s words made sense. Indeed, this had been the way of the world since ancient times—the wealthy squandered recklessly while the poor might go days without a full meal. It was an inexorable logic, for who could blame poverty?

**Chapter 4351: A Secret Discovered**

After the two young patrons left, the young man still felt uneasy. Had they truly stumbled upon free silver today? The girl walking beside him, arm linked with his, said, “Are you still brooding over this? We’ve lost nothing—in fact, we gained a silver ingot for nothing. Why dwell on it?”

“I’m wondering… Did that gentleman make a mistake? Or perhaps he misgave it? He didn’t seem foolish, so why hand me silver?” The young man frowned. “That table of dishes was clearly meant to be discarded, yet he deliberately paid to take them. Why?”

“To me, he was simply a kind-hearted wealthy man—one with coin to spare,” the girl replied with a smile.

“Why say that? How do you know he’s kind? Do you know him?”

Giggling, she said, “Of course I don’t. But strangers can still understand each other. Think—he drank nearby for hours, surely overhearing our conversation. He learned of our troubles, saw how much silver you’d wasted on that feast, and offered that ingot under the guise of buying the leftovers. He recognized your distress and chose to help.”

“Impossible! We’ve never met. Why would he give me silver? Though that meal cost me half a year’s savings, he owes me nothing!”

“Hence, he is kind *and* wealthy. First, he lacks no coin. Second, hearing our plight moved him to aid us—acquaintance or not.”

The young man pondered this. The dishes were indeed useless—eaten or discarded. If the man wished to treat friends, he could simply order anew. Why buy theirs?

“If that’s true, shouldn’t we return to thank him?”

“Unnecessary. We’ve no time, and he clearly desired no gratitude. Take this fortune as a blessing and rejoice!”

“The rich truly live differently… Yet such kindness among them is rare. If fate allows, we must repay him someday.” The young man sighed, unsettled by the unearned silver.

Returning to Aze and Wang Jun’s room, Guan Yu found them still awake. “What are you two doing up so late? Insomnia?”

“Guan Yu! Perfect timing—come see this!” Wang Jun exclaimed, voice tinged with curiosity.

The pair sat by a candle, examining the iron fan—a magical artifact gifted to Wang Jun by Xuan Ming. Its frame was metallic (unidentified due to time constraints), while the panels appeared crafted from beast hide etched with cryptic patterns.

“What’s strange about the fan?” Guan Yu asked, seeing nothing amiss.

“I took it out earlier for a casual look and stumbled upon a secret,” Wang Jun explained, lifting the fan. “Hold it to the candlelight. You’ll see.”

Guan Yu obeyed. The candle’s glow should not penetrate the thick hide, yet it did—revealing densely packed symbols resembling Chinese radicals or Japanese script, though unrecognizable.

“Strange… What is this?”

Aze interjected, “Those symbols are definitely a script. I’ve seen similar in the Yunqing Sect, though I can’t recall where.”

“They’re undeniably characters, but untranslatable,” Wang Jun said. “Guan Yu, do you recognize them? They resemble Japanese, no?”

Nodding, Guan Yu replied, “Similar, yet distinct. Some look pictorial—utterly unfamiliar.”

“Why does the hide transmit light? It defies logic,” Guan Yu mused, turning the fan over.

“I wondered the same, yet here we are,” Wang Jun said excitedly. “Lying idle, I chanced upon this by holding it to the flame.”

“Could this be a cultivation manual hidden within the artifact?” Wang Jun’s eyes sparkled. “If deciphered, it might reveal an extraordinary technique, given its secrecy.”

“Likely,” Guan Yu agreed. “If Brother Jinci were here, perhaps he could translate it.”

**Chapter 4352: One Minute Earlier**

“But he isn’t,” Wang Jun said. “Even if he were, these symbols are too obscure—likely not Japanese. He’d struggle too.”

“Let’s transcribe them for study,” Guan Yu suggested. “Inspecting them this way is tedious.”

“Exactly! Aze and I are halfway done, meticulously copying each mark. If these are cultivation mnemonics, accuracy is vital.”

“Admirable dedication,” Guan Yu yawned. “Carry on. I’ll rest.” He sprawled on a lounge chair, leaving Wang Jun exasperated.

Aze remarked, “I’ve definitely seen this script at Yunqing. I’ll ask Master upon return.”

“Let’s finish quickly,” Wang Jun sighed. “Leave Guan Yu—he’s drunk anyway.”

At dawn, the inn’s earliest riser—the attendant—opened doors and cleaned. Tenants stirred slowly, save Siqi, already meditating. Guan Yu’s room lay silent, its occupants dead to the world after a late night.

Siqi, habitually rising early, meditated upon waking—a practice she believed enhanced focus. Today, however, her calm broke upon finding Guan Yu absent. Hearing snores behind a door, she knocked.

“Who’s there?” Guan Yu mumbled.

“It’s Siqi. Forgive me—I didn’t mean to wake you.”

“No matter. What is it?”

“Nothing urgent. Rest more.” Blushing, she retreated.

Though weary, Guan Yu roused himself. The group would soon depart. Consulting a map, he calculated their route: reach Liaozhou City by dusk or stop at Qizhen.

**Chapter 4353: Provocation**

Liaozhou—the fiefdom of Prince Zou, granted by the Emperor for saving his life—was renowned as the North’s wealthiest city under the prince’s governance. Though somewhat self-serving, Prince Zou had proven pragmatic and approachable during their travels.

Next lay Shacheng, the desert’s nearest hub. There, they’d gather intelligence, hire guides, and procure camels—essential for traversing the sands.

At breakfast, Lin Chen approached. “Guan Yu, let’s carry rations to hasten our journey. Skip inns—travel day and night.”

“Unwise,” Guan Yu countered, suspecting Ling Su’s influence. “Exhaustion in the desert risks lives. Proper rest is vital.”

Lin Chen’s proposal masked another agenda—to isolate Siqi until the desert’s dangers ensured her compliance. But Guan Yu saw through it. Safety demanded balance, not recklessness.

The path ahead wound toward adventure and hidden truths, each step revealing secrets as cryptic as the fan’s etched symbols.
