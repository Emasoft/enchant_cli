Glancing at the time—already past 3 AM with less than two hours until dawn—Guan Yu sighed. His plan to transfer the missile wound from his back to Liu Shilei tonight had clearly failed. With a flicker of movement, he vanished once more.

Almost simultaneously, Guan Yu materialized in an alley several blocks away, still cloaked in invisibility. The alley's occupants remained oblivious to his arrival.

Chapter 1671: Dire Straits

Xue Yingfeng leaned against a wall, steel saber in hand, flanked by Snake-Eye and several subordinates. Before them stood over a dozen black-clad figures encircling the group. Guan Yu sensed Xue's party bore serious injuries—evidently they'd fought fiercely before arriving here. Though most assailants also showed wounds, their numerical advantage had forced Xue's band into this desperate position. Without intervention, annihilation seemed inevitable.

"What do you want?" Xue rasped, pressing a hand to his bleeding shoulder. "I'm just a businessman. Gold? Goods? Name your price!" Behind him, Snake-Eye and others swayed unsteadily, blood pooling at their feet. The black-clad contingent leveled an arsenal of blades and firearms at the wounded group.

A feminine voice rang from the enemy ranks as a sword-wielding figure stepped forward. "Spare your lies, Xue Yingfeng. Dragon Group's M Province commander—second-class variant from Ancient Breeze Town beneath South Mountain. Eight years ago underwent experiments at Divine Relic before joining Dragon Group. Parents in hometown, wife thirty-eight, daughter fourteen. Still claim to be ordinary?"

Xue paled as the woman detailed his family—clear threat. "Face me like warriors! Leave kin out of this!"

The swordswoman laughed. "History belongs to victors. Join Fengyun Society, and we toast as brothers. Refuse..." Her blade gleamed. "Your bloodline ends tonight."

Previous attempts to coerce Xue through his daughter Xue Jing had failed due to Guan Yu's interference. Now Fengyun Society deployed overwhelming force—two second-class variants, one third-class, and ten pseudo-psychics against Xue's lone second-class variant and pseudo-psychic subordinates.

Guan Yu observed invisibly. Xue's group survived only because their attackers also sustained heavy damage. The swordswoman—apparently leader—gestured impatiently. A hulking subordinate growled, "Surrender or die, Meiko!"

Chapter 1672: Recruitment

"Meiko?" Guan Yu's brow furrowed. Xue had described Fengyun Society as domestic, yet this hinted at Eastern Island involvement.

The swordswoman—Meiko—shot her subordinate a venomous look before addressing Xue. "Last chance—submit or perish!"

Xue's saber hummed as he addressed his men. "Brothers...forgive me leading you here." His companions straightened despite wounds. Snake-Eye declared hoarsely, "We'd have died gutter rats without you. Today we die proud!"

As Meiko raised her sword, laughter echoed through the alley. "Catching strays at this hour, Brother Xue? Allow me." Guan Yu materialized, temporal energy freezing combatants mid-motion.

"Guan Yu!" Xue sagged in relief while Fengyun Society members blanched. Such power suggested first-class variant—beyond their combined strength.

Meiko recovered first, sheathing aggression for honeyed tones. "Our leader offers you Fengyun Society's helm. Three hundred at your command...and beauties surpassing Liu Shilei." With flourish, she shed her cloak, revealing lithe form.

Snake-Eye choked. "That's Eastern Island's famed 'Milk Bath Meiko'! Took twenty men in her signature film!"

Guan Yu's lip curled. "You compare this rutting bitch to Shilei? Your stench of spent lust nauseates." His hand flicked—Meiko's mask flew off, confirming her adult film notoriety.

Chapter 1673: Annihilation

Enraged, Meiko lunged. Guan Yu's fingers twitched—air itself compressed with thunderous *crack*. Ten pseudo-psychics exploded in gory mist before their screams faded.

The remaining variants froze. Xue's men gaped as Guan Yu strolled through crimson rain. "Brother Xue, shall we finish this?"
