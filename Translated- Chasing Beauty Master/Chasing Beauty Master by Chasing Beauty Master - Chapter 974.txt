Hou Jinshun sipped his coffee, deep in contemplation. "It doesn't add up. The treasure hunt didn't originate from City A. Outsiders obtained the treasure map and learned the treasure's near City A, which drew hordes of fortune seekers here."

"Then how do you know it's related to the buried treasure from the clan wars over a decade ago?" Guan Yu pressed.

"I just heard this recently. Old-timers know about the massive treasure buried during the clan wars. Now that a new map pointing to City A's vicinity has surfaced, people naturally connect it to that wartime hoard."

"So it's mere speculation? I thought there was concrete evidence," Guan Yu remarked.

"Nobody can prove anything until the treasure's found. Think about it – how many treasure sites could exist in a small place like City A?" Hou Jinshun countered.

Guan Yu considered this might relate to the sealed treasure in Zhang Han's mind. But how did this map emerge? The mystery remained. "Have you seen the treasure map?"

Hou shook his head. "Not personally, but someone copied a fragment." He produced his phone showing a satellite-like diagram on parchment. "This is a replica. The original was said to be detailed on pigskin."

"Damn, this shows nothing useful!" Guan Yu complained.

Regardless of the map's authenticity, Guan Yu resolved to protect Zhang Han's legacy and monitor incoming treasure hunters. "Keep me updated. This treasure interests me now," he declared.

Xue Jing snorted nearby. "Since when aren't you interested? Why meddle in others' treasure hunt?"

"It's a map to vast riches! Who wouldn't care?" Guan Yu drawled. "I might not need wealth, but I'll ensure nobody else finds it either."

Hou interjected, "There's another rumor – false, it seems. People claim you possess a crucial map fragment. Many seek you, through negotiation or force."

"Who's spreading this shit?" Guan Yu exploded. "I've never seen any map! This is pure slander!"

Fuming, Guan Yu strategized: "We need to redirect their focus. Any ideas?"

"Crude but effective – forge a map. Claim the Yang Family safeguards it. Their reputation will deter most seekers. Auction the fake through their venue later. The frenzy will fade after it's sold."

Guan Yu approved. "Spread the word. I'll contact the Yangs."

At Qiaoyuan District, Yang Conghan listened as Guan Yu explained the situation. "Whether real or not, this influx spells trouble. Someone wants others to eliminate you," she deduced.

After outlining his plan, Yang agreed: "Feasible. The Yangs can profit through auctions without liability. We'll host multiple sales for maximum gain."

Chapter 2491: Repaying a Favor

Next morning brought news of Shen Fangcheng's suicide. Guan Yu paused, respecting the finality of death erasing past grudges.

As outsiders flooded City A, Yang Patriarch received peculiar guests. Qu Guandao arrived first – a fiftyish man in anachronistic cloak and headscarf. Soon joined by Auntie Yingshan, an obese woman moving with eerie lightness.

"Your treasure map fragment..." Qu began, cut off by Yang's announcement: "It goes to auction tomorrow. The Yangs retain no stake."

Qu's smile froze. Auntie Yingshan entered bluntly: "Name your price for viewing it."

Tensions flared when old rivals recognized each other. "You poisoned my men for jade in Gushi!" Qu accused, whipping out steel prayer beads.

Auntie countered with a venomous black spider on silk thread. As steel beads shattered chairs, the spider lunged at Qu, filling air with poison stench. Yang Patriarch observed calmly – Qu's Second-Class Eminent Mid-Level cultivation overpowered the toxin mistress.

Their battle raged through the hall – Qu's metallic rosary clashing against Yingshan's silver bracers. Though outmatched, the poisoner kept retreating, until Qu's final swing sent her spider pet skittering across marble floors.
