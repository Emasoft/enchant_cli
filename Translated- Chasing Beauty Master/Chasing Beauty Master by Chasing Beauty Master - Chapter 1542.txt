Xiao Zhi was taken aback, never expecting Wang Jun to settle accounts with him at this moment. "Why should I return it? Wasn't it agreed that Du Bingyan would repay you when she's capable of earning money?"

"Bullshit! I gave her gold leaves entirely for your sake! Otherwise, why would I know who she is? Why should I give her anything? Besides, how can such a stingy guy like you court girls? They'd run away the moment they see your miserliness!"

Xiao Zhi felt irritated by the accusations but couldn't relinquish such a large gold ingot. Giving it to Wang Jun felt like a tremendous loss. "Just because I'm stingy with you doesn't mean I'd be the same with girls! Moreover, it's still uncertain what relationship I'll have with Du Bingyan. Stop making excuses!"

Wang Jun pointed at Xiao Zhi's nose. "You're ungrateful and petty! With your father being the Cloud Azure Sect's Chief, you've never lacked money. But I'm different! Do you know how I suffered? Orphaned since childhood, drifting through life until fate brought me to Cloud Azure Sect. Without that, I'd have starved on the streets! You can't comprehend the hardships I've endured!"

Seeing his previous approach ineffective, Wang Jun quickly switched to emotional manipulation, betting on Xiao Zhi's kindness to acquiesce through feigned vulnerability.

"You might have suffered before, but now you carry multiple gold leaves while crying poverty to me? Have you no shame?" Xiao Zhi retorted unwillingly.

Infuriated, Wang Jun jabbed a finger at him. "You refuse to listen to reason, good or bad! Fine! Neither of us gets anything. I'll go wake Guan Yu right now!"

"Wait, wait..." Xiao Zhi hastily grabbed Wang Jun, lowering his voice to avoid disturbing Guan Yu. "Don't be hasty! I never said I'd keep the extra gold ingot. Let's discuss splitting it fairly."

Finally relenting, Wang Jun said, "Alright. How do you propose we divide it? Know this—I won't accept being shortchanged."

After pondering, Xiao Zhi suggested, "I have an idea."

"Let's hear it. If it's another self-serving scheme, I won't agree."

"Remember the silver Father gave me before leaving? It's with Guan Yu now. I'll give you all that silver in exchange for the extra gold ingot." Before Wang Jun could protest, Xiao Zhi added, "Alternatively, you take this ingot and give me all your gold leaves. Choose whichever suits you."

Wang Jun stroked his chin. The prince's gold ingot was substantial—trading his few remaining gold leaves would be profitable. Currently, he only had two left.

"Your words, not mine! No regrets!" Wang Jun swiftly detached a purse and tossed it to Xiao Zhi, pocketing five gold ingots. "My gold leaves for your ingot—done!"

When Xiao Zhi checked the purse, he found only one gold leaf. "Are you joking? Just one? You're even stingier than I thought! I said all of them!"

"Keep your voice down! Want to wake Guan Yu?" Wang Jun hissed. "I only have one left. Yesterday there were two, but I gave one to Du Bingyan."

"Impossible! Your purse was full before. How could only one remain?" Xiao Zhi protested.

What should have been a fair exchange left him shortchanged. Wang Jun confessed, "Truth is, Chief Lu did give me many gold leaves initially, but I've spent them all. See for yourself!"

He produced a crossbow mechanism. "Chief Lu's gold leaves funded these modifications. High-density metal was needed for counterweights—gold was the only option available. Do you think I'm mad to use gold where iron suffices? Search me if you don't believe it—any gold you find is yours!"

"Damn!" Xiao Zhi gaped at the intricate device. "You're not poor—you're extravagant! Using gold for crossbow parts? Who'd believe you're destitute with this?"

Wang Jun explained, "You don't understand engineering. Gold's density was necessary for proper weighting. Did you think I'd waste it frivolously?"

Xiao Zhi frowned, deciding to drop the argument before Guan Yu awoke and ruined everything.

"Fine. Keep Du Bingyan's gold leaf. You take five ingots, I'll take four," Xiao Zhi conceded.

Wang Jun grinned. "My thanks! Hide them quickly before Guan Yu notices."

"Let's say we won them at the casino last night. He won't claim what's rightfully ours." Despite his words, Xiao Zhi hastily concealed the ingots.

"Wishful thinking! You underestimate him," Wang Jun retorted. "Even casino winnings would make him demand a share. Stay quiet and avoid his notice."

Xiao Zhi nodded, admitting Wang Jun's logic. The latter returned to bed but found sleep elusive. After washing up and changing clothes, Xiao Zhi asked, "I'm going out. Join me?"

"To meet your sweetheart? Should I third-wheel?" Wang Jun smirked. "No thanks. Go alone—watch your step."

"Enough nonsense!" Xiao Zhi left, still puzzled by the "third-wheel" comment.

**Chapter 4000: A Stinging Cheek**

"Where are you going? What time is it?" Guan Yu emerged as Xiao Zhi reached the door.

"You're awake?" Wang Jun chimed. "Xiao Zhi met a girl last night—smitten already! Can't wait to see her again."

"Truly?" Guan Yu eyed Xiao Zhi skeptically, accustomed to Wang Jun's jests.

Though embarrassed, Xiao Zhi treated Guan Yu like an elder brother. Scratching his head, he admitted, "I met someone... just friends for now. Don't mind Wang Jun's exaggerations."

"Excellent news! Chief Zheng will rejoice. Who is she?" Guan Yu sniffed the air. "Superb wine—where's that aroma from?"

"Sharp nose!" Wang Ju pointed to an ornate square cask. "A gift from the prince."

"Splendid! This vintage must be over a decade aged." Guan Yu poured a sip, savoring it. "Hungry now. Xiao Zhi, summon the waiter. I'll order hearty dishes to accompany this."

After dispatching Xiao Zhi, Guan Yu inquired, "What kept you two awake all night?" Eyeing Wang Jun, he added, "Why tag along on Xiao Zhi's romantic escapade?"

"Helped resolve some issues," Wang Jun said. "Our friend here's head over heels."

Guan Yu chuckled. "Did you both entertain one girl all night?"

They glared at his implication. "Not my taste," Wang Jun scoffed. "Xiao Zhi's courtship had... complications."

Noticing Xiao Zhi's face, Guan Yu exclaimed, "Damn! Brother—what mauled your cheek? Those clear palm marks! Did a girl thrash you both night-long?"

"Misunderstanding!" Xiao Zhi groaned, cheek throbbing anew.

Wang Jun grinned. "Let me explain. Last night, our friend here tried groping a lass and earned that slap."

Guan Yu nearly spilled his wine laughing. "Since when did you become such a rogue? Where'd you touch her?"

"Emergency rescue!" Xiao Zhi glared at Wang Jun. "He had a blade at his throat! I acted hastily and...accidentally brushed against her."

"Wang Jun bested by a woman?" Guan Yu raised an eyebrow. "Even weakened, he could've escaped."

"Didn't want to hurt her," Wang Jun shrugged. "Meanwhile, this oaf fell from the sky onto me mid-scuffle. Nearly crushed me before copping a feel. She showed mercy not killing him."

Their overlapping accounts baffled Guan Yu. "One at a time! Wang Jun—start from the beginning. If our brother was wronged, we'll reclaim dignity!"

"Reclaim? Think this is A City with your gang here?" Wang Jun snorted. Despite the jest, Guan Yu felt a pang of nostalgia for his absent comrades.

"Even alone, I'll defend my brothers," Guan Yu declared, thumping his chest.

Wang Jun rose, pouring himself wine. "Listen well then. Last night, we encountered street performers using outdated tricks—chest-smashing stones, boiling oil pots. Bored, we left."

"Wait!" Xiao Zhi interjected. Wang Jun cut him off: "Still smarting? Hush!"

Guan Yu demanded clarity. Xiao Zhi blurted, "He omitted the best part! Wang Jun wore women's attire yesterday. In the crowd, someone groped his backside—left a black handprint on his white skirt!"

Wang Jun shot daggers at him. Guan Yu choked on his wine. "Then what?"

"Later, we posed as fortune-tellers to earn silver," Wang Jun continued, ignoring Xiao Zhi. "Successful enough, we headed back until spotting a grand establishment—inn, brothel, casino, bathhouse all-in-one. We entered the casino, chased a thief who turned tables on me. Xiao Zhi's 'rescue' involved groping the culprit—hence the slap."

"Thus began his infatuation?" Guan Yu asked.

"There's more," Wang Jun said. "Post-slap, we encountered an elderly fraud—the thief in disguise! Learned her parents were gravely ill, forcing her into theft. By the time we offered help, her parents were beyond saving."

Guan Yu shook his head. "Eventful night! I'd like to meet this woman."

"You shall," Wang Jun grinned. "Xiao Zhi invited her to Cloud Azure Sect!"
