“I refuse to believe those so-called fans could breach the Feng family's gates. Besides, I'm sending Poison Widow and Luo Bo together precisely to ensure absolute security. We'll act covertly – who would ever know it was us?” Bill Lin declared stubbornly.

Young Master Feng rose, regarding Bill Lin with undisguised contempt. “Let me offer you some advice. If you could defeat Guan Yu, everything would be simple. But as things stand, you'd better stop digging your own grave.”

In recent days, Young Master Feng had gained profound clarity. Logically speaking, given Guan Yu's immense power, he hadn't utilized external forces during his conflicts with Bill Lin, relying solely on his immediate circle. This indicated Guan Yu wasn't seeking total annihilation. If he truly wished to eliminate the Feng family or crush Bill Lin, he could simply mobilize his full strength instead of engaging in these petty skirmishes.

Thus, Guan Yu wasn't taking Bill Lin seriously – merely toying with them. The day Guan Yu tired of this game, he might flatten the Feng family in one stroke. While Guan Yu might have reservations about directly destroying the Feng family (as the Bill clan would inevitably seek revenge, escalating matters to full-scale conflict between Huayu Group and the Bill family), he clearly wanted to avoid immediate escalation, hence his continued cat-and-mouse games with Bill Lin.

“Why do you always side with outsiders? Are you pleased watching Guan Yu's rising dominance?” Bill Lin shouted angrily.

Chapter 2853: Handle With Care

The current Young Master Feng was no longer the impetuous youth of before. Those who suffered major defeats against Guan Yu inevitably matured. “I'm not siding with outsiders – I'm warning you. Moreover, do you think I don't know what's truly in your heart? Do you have any complete strategy against Guan Yu?”

“Of course not! If I did, would I endure his provocations until now?”

“Exactly,” Young Master Feng pressed. “To confront Guan Yu, first make him submit before moving against his allies. Strike his people first, and regardless of success, you'll face devastating retaliation. Prepare yourself psychologically.”

Pausing meaningfully, he continued, “Consider our former Four Young Masters at Kaihuang Academy. Only I remain. Not because I'm stronger, but because I never touched Guan Yu's inner circle.”

As Young Master Feng ascended the stairs, Poison Widow studied Bill Lin's contemplative expression. Softly, she inquired, “Young Master Bill, should we still capture...”

His warning made Poison Widow reconsider. While Guan Yu appeared less fearsome than imagined, this was only true when his reverse scales remained untouched. Were he truly determined, leveling the Feng estate seemed entirely possible.

Bill Lin murmured, “Let's shelve this matter. Our priority remains acquiring the treasure map.”

“What should I do now?”

“Accompany me to Golden Prosperity Pawnshop tomorrow. We'll meet Old Wu. Station extra guards – we'll simply purchase the map.”

“Notify me before departure,” Poison Widow turned to leave, but Bill Lin stopped her. “Wait! I can't abandon Qu Shuangshuang so easily. Have your idle subordinates infiltrate Kaihuang Academy. Monitor her constantly. Capture her when necessary – but ensure absolute secrecy.”

Obsessed day and night with Guan Yu's women, Bill Lin found himself enchanted by each new beauty. Even without confronting Guan Yu directly, these women alone had him utterly spellbound.

“I'll handle it discreetly,” Poison Widow promised. Exiting, she headed toward the north building but spotted Luo Bo training in the courtyard.

Since their shared ordeal, an unexpected bond had formed between them – unknown to Bill Lin, who would certainly oppose it. While Luo Bo represented a crucial Bill family asset, Poison Widow remained expendable. Any romantic entanglement risked compromising Luo Bo's loyalty should circumstances change.

“Training so late? Rest is important too,” she approached solicitously.

Luo Bo paused, sweat dripping. “This body fears rest more than exertion. Years of comfort dulled my edge. Recent events proved even young whelps surpass me now. Shouldn't I feel ashamed? I must train harder to honor my cultivation.”

Theoretically both First-Class Adepts (Lower Rank), Poison Widow paled against Luo Bo's near-Mid Rank prowess forged through decades of cultivation. Her rapid ascension through external means left her inferior in comprehension and combat experience.

Poison Widow's cultivation stagnated since finding solace with Luo Bo, her once-consuming hatred mellowing through feminine affection – though she hadn't yet realized this stagnation.

“While cultivation matters, overexertion harms any body,” she urged gently.

Luo Bo never expected to find companionship. His gaunt frame and facial scar (hidden under a perpetual cap) made him unappealing except for martial prowess. Yet their twenty-year age gap mattered not – Poison Widow's mature charm and recent care with appearance had thoroughly captivated him.

“Understood. I'll clean up,” he conceded.

Her eyes glinted. “Why not use my bathroom?” Luo Bo's eyebrows shot up. “Excellent! My room's too chilly anyway.”

En route, Luo Bo inquired about her earlier discussion.

“Bill Lin wanted to abduct a girl, but Young Master Feng warned against provoking Guan Yu. Instead, we'll investigate covertly. Tomorrow we visit Golden Prosperity Pawnshop to buy the treasure map.”

Chapter 2854: Early Morning

Mentioning the treasure map reignited Poison Widow's greed. Acquiring it could fund her organization independently. But challenging Bill Lin now meant facing both him and Guan Yu – untenable.

“Abducting the girl is unwise. It wouldn't cripple Guan Yu, only provoke his wrath. Without better strategies, we must refrain,” Luo Bo agreed.

Entering her quarters, he cautioned, “Our relationship must stay hidden. Bill Lin's genteel facade masks deep suspicion. He'd never approve.”

Poison Widow understood workplace romance taboos. “Don't worry. I'll be discreet.”

Chapter 2855: Intentional Provocation

Dawn found Poison Widow jolted awake by incessant calls. “Young Master Bill? What's urgent this early?” She groaned, sleep-deprived from last night's activities.

“Weren't we visiting the pawnshop today? It's nearly six!” Bill Lin snapped, having spent the night agonizing over Qu Shuangshuang's photos.

“The pawnshop opens at nine. Old Wu arrives at ten – as you told me yesterday. Has this changed?”

Realizing his error but too agitated to wait, Bill Lin invented errands. Poison Widow complied wearily, assembling guards for their three-car convoy.

Approaching Kaihuang Academy, she warned, “Your conspicuous vehicles will alert Guan Yu instantly. Can't you endure a little longer?”

Noting Bill Lin's dark circles and lethargy, she deduced his sleepless night. Relenting, he slept in the car until nine.

At the pawnshop, a capped figure entered. Though unfamiliar, Poison Widow dismissed him as non-threatening – sensing no cultivator's aura.

Inside, Bill Lin grew suspicious. “Eject that man. He'll complicate matters.”

Feigning accident, Poison Widow attempted to scald the stranger. “Oops!” She tilted the water pot toward him...
