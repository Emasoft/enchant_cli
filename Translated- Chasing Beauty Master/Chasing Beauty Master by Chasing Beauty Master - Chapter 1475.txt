A little girl was playing with a pile of sand on the ground, flattening it one moment and piling it into small mounds the next, thoroughly engrossed in her game.

Wang Jun, fearing to startle the child, said to Guan Yu, “Hold the horse here and wait. I’ll go ask.”

With a warm smile, he approached and crouched down, speaking softly, “Hello, little sister.”

The girl looked up with a dirt-smudged yet endearing face, her hair tied into two messy pigtails. Hearing Wang Jun’s greeting, she paused her play, glanced at him and then at Guan Yu standing in the distance. With childlike innocence, she asked, “Elder Sister, are you bad people here to catch me? My mother forbids me to play outside. I sneaked out. Could you please not take me away? If Mother finds me missing, she’ll worry.”

It seemed she was indeed a disobedient child who had slipped out against her parent’s warnings.

Wang Jun chuckled, “We’re not bad people. Of course we won’t take you. But why won’t your mother let you play outside? It’s daytime—nothing dangerous happens now.”

“Mother says there are big bad men who snatch children. If I come out, they’ll catch me and feed me to wolves.”

Her words echoed the typical fables parents use to keep children from wandering. Wang Jun replied, “You’re right to want to play, but since your mother says it’s unsafe, why not take your sand friends home? You can play indoors.”

Just then, a woman’s voice called from the alley, “Xiao Yuan! Xiao Yuan, where are you? Can you hear me?”

“Oh no! Mother’s noticed I’m gone!” The girl hastily dropped her handful of sand. “I must go back or she’ll scold me! Goodbye, Elder Sister!” She turned and scampered away.

Wang Jun followed, noting the woman’s voice originated deeper in the alley. The girl’s name, Xiao Yuan, struck him as rather plain. He trailed her, hoping to meet her mother and inquire about the area.

As Xiao Yuan dashed inward, a wooden door at the alley’s end creaked open. A woman in her twenties emerged—pale-faced, simply dressed, clearly from an ordinary household. Though youthful, Wang Jun knew early marriages were common here; a mother of twenty with a young child was unsurprising.

**Chapter 3845: Hospitality**

Upon seeing Xiao Yuan safe, the woman’s tense expression eased—until she noticed Wang Jun behind her. Panic flashed across her face as she rushed out, scooped up the girl, and hurried back inside, slamming the door shut.

Wang Jun called, “Hello! May I ask you something?”

Receiving no reply, he repeated louder, “I mean no harm. Could we speak?”

Silence persisted. Wang Jun glanced helplessly at Guan Yu, who gestured to leave the reluctant woman be. But just as Wang Jun turned to leave, the door reopened. The woman whispered, “You’re outsiders, aren’t you? Come in.”

They entered a modest but tidy home. The woman brought water, saying, “You look weary from travel. Drink.”

Xiao Yuan proudly displayed a handmade cloth doll. “Mother made this! It belonged to my elder sister, but now it’s mine!”

Wang Jun admired it warmly. “How lovely! Take good care of it.”

Guan Yu observed the dwelling—evidently a single-parent home. “Thank you for your kindness,” he said. “We sought an inn, but found few, all closed. Does something trouble this town?”

The woman, Liu Yun, served water but remained silent until Guan Yu asked her name. “Just call me Liu Yun,” she murmured.

Wang Jun ventured, “Forgive my asking—where is your husband?”

Liu Yun’s face fell. “He... was a garrison soldier. Killed days ago on duty.”

“My condolences,” Wang Jun said hastily.

“No matter. I must stay strong for Xiao Yuan.”

Guan Yu inquired gently, “Xiao Yuan mentioned an elder sister?”

Liu Yun’s composure shattered. Tears streamed as she choked out, “My eldest daughter... vanished last month. We found her... her corpse. My husband died investigating.”

Xiao Yuan glared at them. “You made Mother cry! I thought you were good!”

Wang Jun soothed, “We’re sorry. We didn’t mean to upset you. This elder brother here”—she gestured to Guan Yu—“is very capable. Perhaps he can help.”

Guan Yu added, “If you need aid, we’ll try.”

Liu Yun wiped her eyes. “The killers... they’re half-demons from the northern mountains. Some look human but have beast heads. They’ve taken countless women—even girls.”

**Chapter 3846: Limited Means**

Guan Yu frowned. “Half-demons? They’re rare this far from the desert’s Miao City. The local authorities should handle this.”

“The garrison tried,” Liu Yun said bitterly. “Sixty soldiers went. Eight died. The rest fled. Now the half-demons grow bolder—snatching women in daylight.”

Wang Jun whispered to Guan Yu, “The sect forbids meddling in official matters. Remember Inspector Zhou’s death?”

Yet Guan Yu’s resolve stirred. “If I can stop them, I must try.”

Liu Yun pleaded, “You’re martial artists, yes? Please help our town!”

Guan Yu hesitated. “Two against many... But tell me more.”

“Some collaborators live here,” Liu Yun revealed. “They spy and break into homes for victims. They want every woman gone.”

“Likely harvesting female yin energy for dark cultivation,” Guan Yu mused. Though wary of delays, his conscience pricked him. “We’ll scout the mountains tonight.”

**Chapter 3847: Reward**

Liu Yun urged, “Rest here. Leave tomorrow. This isn’t your burden.”

But Guan Yu shook his head. “I’m no savior, but I can’t ignore this. If there’s a way, we’ll act.”

Wang Jun nodded. “We’ll assess their strength first.”

As night fell, Guan Yu’s mind churned—half-demons, abductions, a town gripped by fear. Whether heroism or folly, their path was set.
