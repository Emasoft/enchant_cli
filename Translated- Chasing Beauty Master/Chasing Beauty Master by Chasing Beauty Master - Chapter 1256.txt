“Correct,” the other nodded. “Because you cannot capture Qianhui Peak in one fell swoop, and Xuanming still possesses the Hidden Dragon Sword. Without seizing that sword first, dealing with Yunqing Sect will be extremely difficult. I trust you understand this?”

The black-clad man leaning on a cane nodded. “This much I comprehend. However, during the Six Peaks Assembly, Xuanming surely won’t bring the Hidden Dragon Sword to the meeting? If we strike then, catching him unprepared, even if he tries to retrieve the sword last minute, it won’t be convenient.”

“You’re mistaken,” countered the other. “The situation isn’t as ideal as you imagine. Though the Hidden Dragon Sword may reside somewhere in the back mountains, don’t forget – there’s still that old man in the Ancestral Hall. He’s no ordinary figure. Even if you ascend tomorrow, capturing Qianhui Peak alone would already be a remarkable feat.”

He produced an object and handed it over. “This is a map of Yunqing Mountain, painstakingly drafted over time. The markings are accurate. The entire Yunqing Sect is easily defended but hard to attack. The only breach lies at Qianhui Peak. Only by securing that foothold can we gain the capability to confront Yunqing Sect.”

The cane-bearing man accepted the map, pondered, then nodded. “Your words hold truth. Tomorrow’s timing isn’t ideal. As you say, to challenge Yunqing Sect requires decisive victory. Otherwise, we’ll face tidal waves of counterattacks. Best to wait until after the Six Peaks Assembly.”

The other clasped hands respectfully. “Thank you, Left Envoy, for trusting me. If I compete in the Assembly’s tournament and reach the final four, I’ll receive the Merit Cauldron’s transmission. Then I can discern its hiding place, allowing us to strike first.”

“Good. Execute this well. Excel at the Assembly.” The cane-wielder’s tone turned brusque as he handed over a pill-like object before departing.

The black-clad cane-bearer walked ahead, trailed silently by another figure in black. Clearly, this man held significant status. After their departure, the remaining shorter individual turned away with a contemptuous smirk.

Only when all three vanished did Guanyu rise, exhaling deeply. He never expected their clandestine meeting. Originally intending to follow Fatty Di, he reconsidered – the plump rabbit in hand demanded attention, and the old fellows could likely handle their affairs.

Guanyu shadowed the two black-clad figures at a distance, certain of remaining undetected. His goal: uncover their destination and identities. The roasting site would be impossible to find now in the pitch-black night – tonight’s feast was forfeit.

After trailing through woods, they reached the forest edge. Surprisingly familiar with the terrain, the duo paused to check surroundings before shedding their night attire.

“Much better,” one remarked, revealing Yunqing disciple robes beneath. Guanyu couldn’t discern their peak affiliation. The transformed pair appeared unexpectedly youthful – the cane-bearer now looked barely thirty.

Guanyu abandoned pursuit. Without evidence, even reporting to Xuanming would prove futile. These intruders clearly had inside guidance to penetrate Yunqing’s defenses undetected.

Retrieving his rabbit, Guanyu backtracked through the maze-like woods. Directionally disoriented, he finally spotted flickering flames – his prepared campsite now occupied by two Yunqing disciples roasting fowl.

“Timing’s everything, eh brothers?” Guanyu emerged smiling.

The plump one tensed while the lanky disciple grinned. “A fellow nocturnal gourmand! Join us!”

As Guanyu approached, the wary plump man asked, “Never seen you before. First time?”

“Indeed,” Guanyu admitted. “Left my supplies here earlier while chasing this rabbit.”

“Impressive catch!” marveled the lanky one. “These hares are cunning sprinters. I’m Zheng Xiaozhi of Xuanzhong Peak. Call me Xiaozhi.”

“Liu Ze, same peak. Call me A’Ze,” the plump one added, eyeing the rabbit hungrily.

“Guanyu of Tiger Head Peak. Two months new. Your guidance would be appreciated.”

Xiaozhi laughed heartily. “A Xuanming disciple! No wonder the daring! Let’s feast – your spices make this fowl divine!”

As the rabbit joined the spit, camaraderie blossomed under the stars – three rule-breakers united by appetite and adventure.
