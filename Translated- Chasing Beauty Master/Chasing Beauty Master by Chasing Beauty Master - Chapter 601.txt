Guan Yu looked up in confusion.

“It’s a True Qi Ball contest! Brother Guan Yu, don’t you know why we condensed these spheres?”

“...I formed mine after seeing you create yours. I didn’t realize you wanted to play this game!”

The True Qi Ball contest was a duel of energy. Two participants sat facing each other, gradually channeling their qi into a spherical object placed between them. If one failed to sustain the required energy output within the time limit, they would suffer backlash from both parties’ qi, temporarily sealing their ability to wield true qi.

Guan Yu hesitated. His reserves far surpassed those of his peers, while Huo Lingling hadn’t even reached the Warrior level. Competing might injure her!

“Brother Guan Yu, what’s wrong?”

“Huo Lingling! Don’t be reckless! You’ll get hurt!” Though the backlash only temporarily disabled qi usage, physical harm was inevitable—their bodies weren’t yet tempered to withstand such forces.

“I truly want to try,” Huo Lingling pleaded, her eyes glistening. “How can I catch up to you without understanding our差距? Even if it hurts, it’s worth it!”

Guan Yu’s lips twitched in resignation. “Fine.”

Relief washed over Huo Lingling like an imperial pardon. “Let’s begin!”

As they sat cross-legged, beams of light emanated from their respective qi spheres, colliding at the midpoint. Guan Yu restrained his output, aiming only to endure the time limit.

Time trickled by. The stark contrast between his dark beam and her white one widened. Beads of sweat rolled down Huo Lingling’s forehead as her light dimmed. Sensing her struggle, Guan Yu reduced his energy flow.

“Huo Lingling, can’t continue?”

Suddenly, she flashed a sly smile. Her white light flared violently, triggering Guan Yu’s instinctive surge of dark energy. The overpowering black beam lunged toward her—

**Chapter 1524: Recovery**

Panicking, Guan Yu severed his qi supply. The recoiling dark energy struck him instead.

“Brother!” Huo Lingling screamed, retracting her pale qi as she rushed to his side.

Guan Yu’s face contorted in agony. Rampant strands of inky qi rampaged through his meridians, threatening to burst from his flesh. This contest was meant for those with steel-forged bodies—the defeated’s qi would merely clash internally if contained by robust physiques. But Guan Yu’s mortal frame couldn’t withstand this turmoil.

Desperation gripped him. If he could repair the ravaged blood vessels and muscles, perhaps he might slow the destruction—or even temper his body slightly.

Ignoring Huo Lingling’s cries, he meditated, focusing inward.

Inside, his circulatory system lay in ruins. Guiding remnants of untouched qi, Guan Yu began reconstructing shattered pathways. Yet the invading energies—simultaneously scorching and frigid—cycled endlessly, undoing each repair. Destruction and reconstruction became an infinite loop.

Huo Lingling watched quietly before settling nearby to replenish her own qi.

Night fell. The grove sank into silence save for occasional birdcalls. Ominous thunder rumbled as storm clouds gathered.

A sigh shattered the stillness.

“Brother! Are you healed?”

Guan Yu eyed the stormy sky and her anxious face. “Why are you still here in this darkness?”

“How could I leave you?” Her smile softened. “This is my fault.”

Cupping her face, he reassured, “I’m fine now. Go home—I’ll follow after some cultivation.”

“Truly?”

“Yes.”

After seeing off the reluctant girl, Guan Yu pondered. Though the invading qi had dissipated and his reserves restored, an odd sensation lingered—the telltale thrill of impending breakthrough!

Ecstatic, he assumed the meditation posture.

His dantian whirled like a vortex, drawing qi faster until a powerful suction erupted. Trees bent toward him, leaves swirling madly. With a resonant *ding*, the maelstrom ceased. Rain cascaded down as if nothing had occurred.

Morning light filtered through wooden shutters onto a sleeping face.

Lin Su (Guan Yu) stretched, bleary-eyed. After breaking through to Warrior Tier 1 last night and replenishing his qi, exhaustion had claimed him.

“Did the repairs strengthen my body?” He muttered, drawing a dagger across his forearm. A centimeter-deep wound welled blood. “No change? Still cuts easily...”

As he prepared to heal it, the injury sealed itself—vanishing without trace. Stunned, Guan Yu realized: his body now regenerated autonomously! While not impervious to weapons, this self-healing marked tremendous progress.

At the clan dining hall, Guan Yu encountered the expedition party heading to reclaim the Jade Stone Gate from the Wang family. Elder Altai sat astride a stallion, flanked by Lin Hui on white steed and Lin Cai on black. Nodding courteously, Guan Yu moved past.

“Wait,” Lin Hui called.

Turning, Guan Yu arched an eyebrow.

“Will you join us? That gate is your rightful prize from defeating Wang Chao.”

“I only wanted to protect Huo Lingling,” Guan Yu declined. The Lin clan’s mercenary mindset repelled him.

Elder Altai interjected, “We’ll prepare a mount—”

“I’m fatigued from cultivation,” Guan Yu cut him off. “Excuse me.”

**Chapter 1525: Vajra Body**

The group gaped at his defiance—none dared oppose Elder Altai so boldly.

Suppressing fury, the elder led the party out. Lin Hui’s eyes narrowed thoughtfully before resuming casual chatter.

Under summer sunbeams, Guan Yu meditated on a jade platform in the cultivation grounds—the clan’s second-most luxurious facility. Three manuals lay before him.

The first, *Swift Steps*, detailed speed techniques. Maximum tier promised near-invisibility—perfect for evasion.

The second contained fist techniques stronger than his current *Cosmic Palm*, but he set it aside. His existing style grew with power.

The third manual’s black cover bore white characters: *Vajra Body*.

This fourth-tier physique-refinement method required brutal training—repeatedly injuring oneself while circulating qi through specific meridians. Mastery granted imperviousness to mundane weapons.

Excitement surged. This was exactly what he needed! But cultivation required medicinal aids far beyond his meager allowance.

An idea struck—his fire-attribute qi could smelt metals. The clan forge held ample materials...

At the foundry, burly Foreman Wang grinned. “Young Master needs iron?”

“Just some scrap, Uncle Wang.”

The man handed over a Qiankun Bag. “Will this suffice?”

“Plenty. I’ll craft weapons to sell for elixir funds.”

Shocked, Foreman Wang offered a jade card. “Take my savings—100 gold taels.”

“I couldn’t!” Guan Yu fled from the generosity.

Watching him go, the foreman sighed. This stubborn boy who’d once vowed to protect him—a fellow outcast—had grown into someone remarkable.

Torrential rain drummed windows as Guan Yu experimented. Each hammer strike resonated through the courtyard—solid, powerful impacts.

Elsewhere, Wang Shan staggered from a vicious blow.

“Altai!” he spat blood.

“Your son gambled away the Jade Stone Gate,” the elder coldly stated. “Burning the jade stores was... unwise.”

**Chapter 1526: Wrath of Lightning**

Clarity hardened Guan Yu’s resolve. The searing pain became bearable.

Lightning arcs danced across his skin, each zap crisping flesh only for dark-green energy to heal it—an endless cycle of destruction and renewal.

Muscles twitched under electric torture. Charred patches appeared and vanished in macabre rhythm. Jaw clenched, fists bloodied from clenched nails, Guan Yu endured.

The thunderstorm’s fury mirrored his inner tempest—a crucible forging something new, something *more*.
