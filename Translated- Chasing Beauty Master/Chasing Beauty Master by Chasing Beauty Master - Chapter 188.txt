Guan Yu's expression turned slightly peculiar. Li Yuanshan's words sounded remarkably like boasting about his son-in-law.

Gu Yuansheng exclaimed in astonishment, clicking his tongue in amazement. "Master Guan, you've concealed your depths remarkably well."

"Just fortunate circumstances," Guan Yu replied modestly.

"I hope we'll have opportunities for collaboration in the future," Gu Yuansheng extended his right hand.

Guan Yu paused momentarily before smiling and shaking the offered hand. "Without doubt."

...

Bang!

Piao Xu returned to his residence and hurled the glass in his hand violently against the wall. "Bastard! This humiliation goes too far! Guan Yu's been playing me for a fool all along!"

As he calmed slightly, Piao Xu suddenly realized Guan Yu had been laying traps from their very first encounter, gradually luring him into an inescapable abyss. By the time Piao Xu truly acknowledged his opponent, Guan Yu had already kicked him into bottomless darkness with no hope of recovery.

Consumed by rage, Piao Xu kicked the coffee table with such force that it overturned, sending shards of broken glass and porcelain scattering across the floor. Still unsatisfied, he proceeded to smash every object within reach until the meticulously decorated room resembled a warzone.

"Ahhh!" Piao Xu roared, chest heaving. "Guan Yu! I'll make you kneel before me! I'll watch you die!"

"Da Qiang!" he bellowed.

A bodyguard entered and bowed. "Young Master Piao."

"Why isn't Guan Yu dead yet? You claimed that assassin never failed! Explain why he still breathes!" Piao Xu nearly foamed at the mouth.

"I... don't know. We've lost contact with the killer," the guard answered truthfully.

"This is your excuse?" Piao Xu slapped the man viciously. "I want him dead tonight! Deploy every resource—I care only for the result!"

As the guard stood trembling, another servant entered holding a phone. "Young Master, your father's call."

Piao Xu batted the phone away. "I'm taking no calls! Fail me again and you'll all be—" He froze mid-tirade. "Wait. Whose call did you say?"

"The Patriarch's call," the servant repeated meekly.

Slap!

"You imbecile! Why didn't you say so immediately?" Piao Xu snatched the phone, breathing deeply to compose himself. "Father. What is it?"

His blood ran cold as the elder Piao's roar erupted from the receiver: "Major Chinese corporations are terminating all collaborations overnight—even paying违约金 to sever ties! This traces back to you, doesn't it?"

Piao Xu confessed everything, his earlier arrogance evaporated.

"You worthless wretch!" The patriarch's voice shook with fury. "While you played actor, you've nearly destroyed Sanxie Group! The board demands answers!"

"I'll take responsibility," Piao Xu growled.

"Responsibility? Can you produce 10 billion?"

"No."

"Then return home immediately! This mess requires adult handling."

"Not until I see Guan Yu bleed!"

"You'll return tomorrow or lose every cent to your name! Test me and see!" The line went dead.

Piao Xu's eyes darkened like stagnant water. "Understood."

Chapter 465: No One Leaves

Lin Dong grinned at Guan Yu. "Old acquaintances needn't stand on ceremony."

Guan Yu barely restrained profanity. They'd met twice at most! Yet he dared not provoke this unpredictable man—especially noting the gun-shaped bulge at Lin Dong's waist.

"Truly, I've observed you many times," Lin Dong continued through mouthfuls of mutton.

Guan Yu's blood chilled. Had this assassin been surveilling him constantly? His scanning system activation confirmed the horrifying truth—Lin Dong's presence permeated his recent history.

"What do you want?" Guan Yu demanded.

"Shared warmth on a cold night. Your woman chose well." Lin Dong gestured at the steaming hotpot.

As Guan Yu calculated stalling tactics until bodyguard Tian Xun's arrival, Lin Dong called for liquor. "Two bottles of erguotou! Big bowls!"

They drank fiercely, Guan Yu relying on his healing system to counteract intoxication. Yet Lin Dong showed no impairment after a full bottle.

"You delay for reinforcements?" Lin Dong smirked. "Your guard currently... contemplates walls in a storage room."

Guan Yu slammed the table. "What did you do to Brother Tian?"

"Alive. For now." Lin Dong rose lazily. "Enough games."

As Guan Yu tensed, Lin Dong's fist shot toward his abdomen. The impact sent Guan Yu flying backward—directly into the path of an overturned hotpot about to drench the terrified Wen Qing.

Activating gravity manipulation, Guan Yu lunged to shield her, bracing for searing pain...

Clang!

Lin Dong interposed a chair, catching the scalding broth. "Such beauty shouldn't be marred," he remarked casually.

"Thank you," Guan Yu said warily, helping Wen Qing stand.

"Gratitude toward your killer? How novel."

"Let her leave," Guan Yu demanded.

"Gladly. She's not my mark."

"Husband..." Wen Qing paled, understanding dawning.

"Go. I'll find escape after." Guan Yu kissed her forehead. "Survive," she whispered before fleeing.

Lin Dong sighed theatrically. "With such a woman, why would anyone choose assassination?"

Their confrontation reignited until a scar-faced man interrupted with ten armed thugs. "Apologies, but no one leaves now."

Chapter 466: Only I May Kill You

Lin Dong's gaze sharpened. "You disrupt my conversation. Begone in ten seconds."

The scarred leader laughed. "That's my line! Five seconds to—"

Crack!

Lin Dong's elbow shattered three ribs before the man could finish. As the thugs drew weapons, Guan Yu recognized their origin through mental scans—not Piao Xu's, but Yang Yang's underworld connections.

"Yang Yang dishonors his military background employing gangsters!" Guan Yu spat.

The remaining thugs leveled guns. "Move and the woman dies!"

Guan Yu's mind raced. With gravity control, he might escape—but ensuring Wen Qing's safety proved impossible.

"Enough talk!" The leader gestured. "Take them both!"

Lin Dong suddenly smiled, cigarette dangling. "Fools. Only I may kill him."

Before the thugs reacted, Lin Dong moved like lightning—disarming two men before their fingers touched triggers. Guan Yu seized the moment, activating gravity reduction to blur toward the nearest attacker.

Chaos erupted as the remaining gangsters hesitated, caught between two unpredictable forces. Lin Dong's laughter rang through the carnage. "This hunt just became interesting!"
