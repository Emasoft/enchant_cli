“If this matter truly spreads, I fear even if Wang Jun retreats to cultivate in seclusion at the Cloud Azure Sect, outsiders will still infiltrate to steal the treasure. After all, the allure of an immortal artifact is too great—there’s simply no avoiding it.”

“Let’s proceed as you suggested. I’ve run out of options. After all, there’s no stopping this matter now—it’s bound to spread sooner or later,” Wang Jun said.

Since Chief Zheng had learned of this, he would undoubtedly report it to Xuan Ming. Once Xuan Ming knew, more would follow, and gradually, word would seep into the Jianghu.

By then, any decision Wang Jun made would likely be too late. If they were to act, it had to be immediately after their return—Wang Jun must first attempt to claim ownership of the artifact. Otherwise, delaying further would only invite Xuan Ming’s summons.

Guan Yu remarked, “This truly is a remarkable treasure. Even if it weren’t an immortal artifact, its craftsmanship alone is fascinating.” He held the Dragon Eye Amber up to the sunlight, observing the mist-like currents swirling within its depths. “It’s breathtakingly beautiful.”

Under the sun’s rays, the amber emitted a blinding radiance—harsher than a smartphone’s flash—when viewed against the light, making it impossible to gaze at directly.

Wang Jun chuckled wryly. “Guan Yu, when I found this in Miao City, it was nestled in what looked like a bird’s nest on the ground. At first, I thought it was an egg. Only upon picking it up did I realize it was a small jade-like stone, resembling amber but unlike any stone I’d seen. It was so peculiar and intriguing that I kept it. Later, in the desert, I nearly tossed it away.”

“Had I known it’d cause such trouble, I would’ve discarded it back then,” Wang Jun grumbled.

“Discard it? Big Brother, this is an immortal artifact! How could you casually throw it aside?” Guan Yu shook his head urgently. “Even if you can’t claim it, you could trade it for several high-grade magical tools. Such a rare treasure is priceless!”

Upon returning to Tiger’s Head Peak, the pair wasted no time. Following Guan Yu’s advice, they quickly gathered their belongings and headed to the forest behind the mountain.

This secluded area, where Guan Yu crafted hand crossbows, was typically undisturbed save for a few visiting craftsmen.

“This room is mine. Try claiming the artifact here—we can’t delay any longer,” Guan Yu urged.

“Alright, I’ll try. But... I don’t know how,” Wang Jun admitted.

Guan Yu handed him the Dragon Eye Amber. “Channel your spiritual power into it. Let your energy seep through. You should sense something. I’m unsure if it houses an artifact spirit. If it does, you must forge a pact with it. If not, attempt to manipulate it directly.”

Wang Jun followed the instructions, focusing his spiritual power and a wisp of soul consciousness into the amber. At first, his energy met resistance, but soon, it began to flow.

**Chapter 4701: The Strange Space**

Wang Jun probed cautiously until, abruptly, his vision brightened. He found himself in an unfamiliar realm. “Where is this? Guan Yu, are you here?” he called out, but no one answered.

The surroundings were shrouded in thick, silent mist. In the distance, faint outlines of mountains and structures loomed. Uncertain whether they were real or illusions, Wang Jun ventured forward, compelled to investigate.

“Could this be inside the Dragon Eye Amber? The space here is vast—like another world,” he mused aloud as he walked.

After hours of exploration revealed no signs of life or the artifact spirit Guan Yu had mentioned, Wang Jun resolved to exit and seek guidance. But a new problem arose: he had no idea how to leave.

Anxiety gripped him. Trapped in this featureless void, would he be imprisoned forever?

Torn between escaping and satisfying his curiosity about the distant mountains, Wang Jun hesitated. The blurred structures on the peaks beckoned, yet the journey seemed daunting.

As he deliberated, the world lurched. In an instant, he stood at the foot of the towering mountain, the mist now cleared. At its summit loomed a pagoda, its purpose unknown.

Wang Jun gasped. *Teleportation?* But who had moved him? He lacked such abilities.

Finding no path up the sheer cliffs, he wondered how to ascend. The moment the thought formed, his body shifted again, depositing him before the pagoda’s entrance.

Amused, Wang Jun realized his thoughts shaped this realm. *Like a dream—where intention becomes reality.*

The massive stone door creaked open. Inside lay an empty hall, devoid of life or objects.

“Who are you?” a voice boomed. Wang Jian spun, finding no source.

“Stop searching. I’m right here,” the voice chided. A figure materialized—a floating torso, severed at the waist.

Wang Jun screamed, stumbling back. The apparition’s upper half belonged to a man in his thirties, features indistinct. “Are you human or a ghost?!”

“Both. Why are you here? How did you enter?” the being countered.

“Your legs—where are they?” Wang Jun blurted.

“How rude!” The voice shifted to a woman’s, the figure morphing into a female form.

Terrified, Wang Jun fled, only to confront a cliff’s edge. Remembering the realm’s logic, he focused—and reappeared in the misty expanse, the mountain distant.

“Incredible... I’m back,” he breathed, shaken by the shape-shifting entity.

“Leaving so soon?” the voice taunted. The half-bodied figure reappeared, eliciting fresh terror.

“I’ve been trapped here endlessly. Stay and converse,” it implored, mood swinging between playful and wrathful.

**Chapter 4702: An Unfunny Joke**

“You’re not my master. Why are you here?” the being demanded. When Wang Jun stayed silent, it threatened, “You’re mere soul essence here. Speak, or I’ll devour you.”

“I—I found the Dragon Eye Amber by accident! I didn’t mean to intrude,” Wang Jun stammered, desperate to escape.

“Lies!” the spirit roared. “None enter this space unwittingly. You’ve disturbed my solitude—now you’ll stay as company!”

“I can’t! My affairs in the mortal world—”

The entity laughed suddenly. “A jest! You should’ve seen your face.”

“This isn’t amusing,” Wang Jun muttered.

“Humor sustains me here. Now, entertain me with questions.”

“Is this truly the Dragon Eye Amber’s interior?”

“Must you state the obvious?” the spirit snapped. “Ask something worthwhile!”

Wang Jun shifted tactics. “The space here—it’s limitless, yet confined?”

“It bends to my will,” the spirit declared. The environment warped, trapping Wang Jun in a shrinking cube. “A step here spans any distance.”

Understanding dawned. “So you control its expansion or contraction?”

“Precisely. Smarter than you look.”

“Why maintain such vastness alone?”

“For exploration! Unlike you, I’m no fool content with cramped quarters.”

Seizing the moment, Wang Jun asked, “You’re the artifact spirit, aren’t you?”

“Obviously! Now, propose something interesting.”

“I wish to claim ownership of the Dragon Eye Amber.”

The spirit erupted in laughter. “You? My master? Absurd!”

**Chapter 4703: A Clever Rescue**

“Think me a fool? I’d sooner rot here than serve you!” the spirit jeered.

Wang Jun persisted. “I found this artifact. Help me harness it, and I’ll free you.”

“Free me?” The spirit stilled, intrigue piercing its capricious demeanor. “Explain.”

“If I become your master, perhaps we can both leave this prison.”

The spirit’s eyes narrowed. “An intriguing gamble... Very well. Prove your worth.”

Thus began Wang Jun’s trial—a battle of wits against an ancient, mercurial entity. Each exchanged barb and insight, the artifact’s secrets slowly unraveling. Outside, Guan Yu guarded the amber, unaware of the duel within that would determine their fates.
