“If Guanyu were to make the request himself, there's no guarantee the other party would agree. Even if they did, there's no telling whether an ambitious person like Xiaomei would obey Guanyu’s orders.

If the Jiayi Sect were brought into the jianghu to develop, only to have Xiaomei lead her disciples in completely ignoring Guanyu’s commands, all his efforts would be wasted.

‘My Jiayi Sect has operated in the desert for so many years,’ Xiaomei said coolly. ‘With matters in Miaocheng settled, we’ll naturally return to our former ways—plundering when we must, killing when necessary. Only through this can we survive in the desert.’

Guanyu feigned concern. ‘Ah, the desert truly isn’t fit for human life. The environment here is harsh, and sudden weather shifts could obliterate entire tribes. Natural disasters are rampant.

‘The jianghu is different,’ he continued, as if tempting her. ‘No violent storms, fewer calamities, and bustling crowds.’

Truthfully, Xiaomei had already considered leading her sect to the jianghu. As Guanyu said, it would spare them the desert’s hardships. But large-scale migration posed challenges requiring meticulous planning.

First and foremost, substantial financial resources were essential. By Xiaomei’s calculations, the Jiayi Sect’s current coffers fell far short.

Another issue was strength. While dominant in the desert, the sect would struggle in the jianghu’s ruthless world where the strong devour the weak. Without powerful backing, they’d soon perish.

Thus, Xiaomei concluded they needed a capable ally—Guanyu. Though she loathed the desert and yearned to expand her sect’s influence, ambition alone wasn’t enough.

‘For years under my leadership,’ Xiaomei sighed, ‘the Jiayi Sect has weakened rather than grown. If given the chance, I dream of relocating our brothers to the jianghu.’

Guanyu inwardly rejoiced. This was precisely the opening he needed. If Xiaomei proved obedient, he could establish the sect as his hidden power in the jianghu.

Yet Xiaomei hesitated, haunted by memories of Honglian Sect and Zhenyang Sect’s devastating spells in Miaocheng. Such power could obliterate her entire sect.

**Chapter 4667: Not That Easy**

Since then, her resolve had wavered. What if relocation led to annexation rather than growth?

Guanyu stood, smiling. ‘Ambition alone won’t suffice. Migrating an entire sect is no simple feat. Do you truly have the capability?’

‘Of course not,’ Xiaomei pressed. ‘But you do, Guanyu. Help us, and you’ll have my eternal gratitude.’

She knew Guanyu possessed deep coffers—his casual offering of eight hundred taels proved it. Now she sought his wealth.

‘This isn’t about capability, but commitment,’ Guanyu countered. ‘The migration will face countless obstacles, foremost being financial. Silver will grease every wheel.’

‘You mock me,’ Xiaomei shook her head. ‘We subsist on raiding other tribes. Our resources are meager.’

Guanyu pressed his advantage. ‘You’ll also need strategic territory in the jianghu—land unclaimed by others unless you can conquer them. Another monumental challenge.’

‘Can’t you assist?’ Xiaomei smiled. ‘Your wealth could secure us prime territory. I know nothing of the jianghu’s layout.’

‘Are you jesting?’ Guanyu feigned offense. ‘Even friends don’t undertake such burdens without reward. What do I gain?’

‘Must friendship come with price tags?’

‘Enough.’ Guanyu’s tone hardened. ‘You know the difficulties. I’ve given you ample benefits already. Maintaining hundreds of disciples requires continuous funds. Even Yungqing Sect relies on wealth to survive.’

Xiaomei fell silent, recognizing the truth. Established sects had income streams built over decades—her sect lacked such foundations without mountains of gold.

‘You’re right,’ she conceded. ‘This dream seems impossible. Perhaps I should first venture into the jianghu alone to learn its ways.’

‘Wisdom,’ Guanyu nodded. ‘Send scouts to establish footholds. Grow gradually. Though...immediate relocation isn’t impossible. I could assist.’

‘Truly?!’ Xiaomei sprang up, eyes wide.

‘With conditions,’ Guanyu said airily. ‘Such efforts demand reciprocity.’

‘Name them!’ Xiaomei’s voice quickened. ‘Anything for this chance!’

**Chapter 4668: Promise**

Guanyu smiled. Perfect. Once funded by his silver, the sect would answer to him despite Xiaomei’s nominal leadership.

‘Your promise suffices,’ he said. ‘Funds I can provide. As for territory, I know ideal lands far from here—a friend’s domain where your sect could thrive.’

‘Marvelous!’ Xiaomei beamed. ‘I thought this mere fantasy. With your help, the entire Jiayi Sect is in your debt. Whatever you need hereafter, we’ll answer.’

Guanyu nodded, satisfied. He’d ensure the sect remained his puppet. The best location? Near Hongren’s territory—close to the capital for future schemes.

The next fragment of the Eight-Sided Drum manual pointed to the capital’s Wan Shou Sheng Chen festivities. Soon, all sects would converge there. With the Jiayi Sect nearby, Guanyu could wield hidden influence.

‘We depart tomorrow,’ Guanyu declared. ‘Bring capable disciples. I’ll arrange everything en route. Once settled, transfer your people.’

‘Words can’t express my gratitude,’ Xiaomei said earnestly. ‘Actions will prove it.’

Though she’d exploited the sect, years of leadership bred attachment. Its growth mattered deeply. As for Guanyu’s future commands—she’d comply, indebted by his aid.

Guanyu’s mind turned to Du Teng at Wujian Manor—another financial pipeline to fund this venture. Though neglecting his estate troubled him, immediate needs took precedence.

**Chapter 4669: Detour**

‘One curiosity,’ Xiaomei ventured. ‘How does a Yungqing disciple command such wealth?’

Guanyu’s expression darkened. ‘Once we enter the jianghu, you’ll see and hear much. Speak nothing of it—ever. Understood?’

‘Of course,’ she vowed. ‘I’ll guard your secrets.’

Satisfied, Guanyu knew his dual identity as Yungqing disciple and shadow powerbroker remained secure. The light rain continued—a welcome respite from the desert’s blistering heat, where even basic comforts like fans were absent.
