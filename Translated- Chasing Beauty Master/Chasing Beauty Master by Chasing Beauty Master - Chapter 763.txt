After retrieving the three poison needles the female assassin had expelled, Guan Yu remarked, "These are the only evidence she left." Each needle measured about one centimeter in length, finer than sewing needles and seemingly crafted from silver.

Zhang Han reached out to examine one, but Guan Yu lightly swatted her inquisitive hand. "Don't touch them. They're poisoned."

The girl retracted her hand with a sheepish tongue-click. Yang Conghan inquired seriously, "Guan Yu, how could someone of your skill fall for an ambush?"

Chuckling, Guan Yu explained, "The assassin's entire body was venomous. I realized too late during our struggle." He omitted the truth - his injury resulted from groping her chest during the fight, a secret he'd take to his grave.

Though skilled, the assassin couldn't match Guan Yu's prowess. His momentary carelessness had enabled her scheme.

"Venomous entire body..." Zhang Han shuddered, goosebumps rising. Yang Conghan frowned. "Who was she? What's her objective?"

"Unclear," Guan Yu shook his head. "But she understands our situation. Her target is undoubtedly Zhang Han, though the reason escapes me." He privately considered the chest injury he'd inflicted on the assassin, but disclosing this would expose how his hand got poisoned.

Zhang Han curled into a frightened ball at the implication of being hunted. This wasn't simple - a bone-shrinking female assassin and multiple skilled pursuers indicated hidden secrets within the girl.

After dinner, Guan Yu's worsening condition prompted him to stay at Yang's residence. His poisoned arm, its meridians sealed to prevent fatal spread, left him single-handed and dependent on assistance for basic tasks.

Zhang Han volunteered as caretaker, internally viewing it as compensation for "playing with him." The inexperienced girl and Yang Conghan jointly bathed the immobilized man. As they undressed him, his rebellious member sprang to attention, flushing both women crimson. The curious Zhang Han even flicked at it playfully while Guan Yu stood awkwardly in the agate tub, one arm raised - his most memorable yet uncomfortable bath.

Bedtime brought conflict. Zhang Han insisted on sleeping with Guan Yu for care, while Yang Conghan doubted her competence. The stalemate ended when Yang invoked her seniority as "aunt," claiming her pristine, azure-themed bedroom where no one else had ever slept.

The chamber smelled of Yang's natural fragrance. Guan Yu collapsed onto the cloud-like bed like a client awaiting courtesans. Yang, blushing crimson, changed into translucent blue sleepwear and lay trembling beside him. The aroused man showed no mercy after his earlier frustration...

Though separated by floors and soundproofing, Yang's muffled cries still kept Zhang Han awake all night.

At breakfast, the puffy-eyed girl complained, "Auntie's noises were so loud! I couldn't sleep at all!" Guan Yu remained silent, marveling at Yang's unexpected vigor surpassing even Lü Mei's.

During breakfast, Wei Hongwei's panicked call came: "Brother Guan! Jia Bo's been beaten at school!"

Speeding through red lights on his Da Hang motorcycle, Guan Yu ignored a pursuing female traffic officer. At campus gates, security guards led by Du Zhao blocked his path.

"Who gave you permission to park here?" Du Zhao sneered. "Want your junker smashed?"

The guards, emboldened by principal connections, had been extorting students and harassing girls. Remembering their previous humiliation in classrooms, they circled Guan Yu menacingly.

"I am the rules here," Guan Yu coldly declared amidst crowd cheers. The ensuing brawl saw security batons against Guan Yu's police-issue club. With brutal efficiency, he disabled six guards, leaving Du Zhao trembling.

"Y-you'll be expelled!" Du Zhao threatened weakly.

"The principal's nothing to me," Guan Yu scoffed, crushing the man's ribs with a club strike. The sickening crack silenced the crowd.

As Du Zhao writhed, Guan Yu loomed over him. "Think you'll report me?" The club rose again—
