“Aiya, you little stinky bird, I’ll pluck all your feathers right now!” Mo Ling flailed her claws menacingly but couldn’t catch Little Black.

Even Lin Dong had trouble catching Little Black, let alone Mo Ling.

Realizing her efforts were futile, Mo Ling’s eyes darted slyly before she turned to Guanyu, hands on hips. “Guanyu, your wife is being bullied by a bird! Aren’t you afraid of becoming a laughingstock?”

“We’re only married in name, not in deed. I beg your pardon,” Guanyu joked, growing fonder of the clever Little Black.

He noticed Little Black was merely teasing Mo Ling playfully, not attacking seriously. Its claws stayed sheathed, as if sharing a tacit understanding that everyone present was his woman and must not be harmed.

Was this due to its previous resonance with the copper coin?

Guanyu dismissed the thought, feeling he’d stumbled upon a treasure.

The other women smiled understandingly at his jest.

“You…” Mo Ling’s face flushed crimson as she stamped her foot in frustration.

“Alright, Little Black, come down once you’ve had your fun.” Guanyu beckoned the hovering bird.

With a chirp, Little Black swooped down and perched firmly on Guanyu’s right shoulder.

“Husband, it actually understands you! How miraculous!” Mo Ling exclaimed. The others crowded around curiously.

“Where did you get this bird? We’ve never seen anything like it,” Wenqing interjected.

“I rescued it while in danger deep in the mountains. It’s remarkably intelligent,” Guanyu explained simply.

“So we’ll have a pet that understands us? How fun! Give it to me, please?” Mo Ling pleaded, eyes gleaming.

Guanyu eyed her suspiciously—knowing Mo Ling’s temperament, the bird might not survive her care.

“I can’t control it. Its stay depends on its own will,” Guanyu said helplessly.

Having witnessed Little Black’s father’s power, Guanyu had considered taming it but relented due to paternal bonds. Still, he hoped Little Black would stay voluntarily.

The fledgling rubbed against Guanyu’s cheek, its intentions unclear even to him.

“Guanyu, this is a gyrfalcon?” Lin Dong suddenly asked.

“You recognize it?” Guanyu said, surprised.

Lin Dong responded with disdain for Guanyu’s ignorance. “You’ve found a treasure.”

**Chapter 822: A Treasure Found**

“A treasure?” Guanyu looked puzzled.

“Gyrfalcons are called ‘Kings of Eagles.’ Among 100,000 eagles, only one might be a gyrfalcon. Pure black with jade-white claws is the rarest, comparable to extinct dinosaurs,” Lin Dong explained.

Guanyu’s face lit up. “So Little Black is a top-tier gyrfalcon?”

“You’re lucky to survive that fall,” Lin Dong remarked drily.

Though irked by the backhanded compliment, Guanyu marveled at Little Black’s potential. An adult gyrfalcon’s speed and strength could rival top snipers. With it, his safety improved.

Ecstatic, Guanyu realized he’d gained a formidable ally.

“Where will you sleep tonight?” Wenqing asked coyly.

Guanyu scanned the women, all eyeing him expectantly. The villa had no spare rooms—even his was occupied by Gao Wei.

“I’ll sleep in the living room,” he offered weakly.

“No!” the women chorused.

After heated debate, Liu Shilei intervened: “Guanyu, take my room. I’ll stay with Lingling.”

Resigned, Guanyu accepted. Though longing to share a bed, he settled for solitude—a small price for peace among his beloveds.
