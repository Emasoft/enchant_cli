“I need to use the bathroom…” The words squeezed through gritted teeth like a tongue-tied mumble, still trailing off into indistinct murmurs...

“What? Can’t hear you! Speak properly!” Guan Yu sighed, massaging his temples in exasperation.

“I need to pee! Need to piss! Clear enough for you now?” Feng Xin’s fiery temperament resurged as she glared at him, her face flushed crimson like drunken embarrassment. She planted hands on hips, eyes blazing.

“Pissing? Why yell about pissing? Think you’re the only one who pees?” Guan Yu retorted with a wry smirk, shaking his head.

“You can’t walk yet! Back to bed – hold it till I return. Look, isn’t this here?” He triumphantly produced a bedpan from beneath the mattress.

Feng Xin stared daggers at him before exploding: “Just kill me now!”

Damn, this tomboy’s impossible! Swallowing pride, Guan Yu approached the nurses’ station. The值班nurse打量him up and down before snapping: “Know how many patients we have? I’m a nurse, not a caregiver! Should I wipe every ass here?”

Blinking at the snippy girl, Guan Yu stammered: “Couldn’t you... make an exception?”

“What next? Help her tonight? Tomorrow morning? The day after?”

He froze – three to five bathroom trips daily... This was unsustainable. Returning defeated, Guan Yu waved the bedpan: “Xin-jie, let’s use this.”

But Feng Xin remained stubbornly rooted, refusing to let the receptacle near her.

“Then what? Nurses won’t help. Hire a caregiver? You refused that too...” Guan Yu slumped, defeated.

“It’s just piss! I’ll do it for you. Or wet yourself – I’ll wash your pants!” He crossed arms challengingly.

“I’ll go myself!” Feng Xin struggled up, balancing on one leg toward the bathroom.

“Wait...” Guan Yu hesitated before blurting: “Should I... carry you?”

Chapter 174: I... Can’t Wipe

Feng Xin bristled like an angry hen: “What did you say?!”

“N-nothing!” Guan Yu backpedaled rapidly. That temper wasn’t to be trifled with.

At the bathroom door, uncertainty gripped him. “Help me in!” Feng Xin ordered, cheeks still flaming.

Moving like a marionette, Guan Yu supported her inside. The cramped space forced proximity. “Close your eyes! Help me sit!” Her voice quivered faintly.

Obediently blind, Guan Yu felt his throat parch. As Feng Xin lowered herself, she realized – pants still on. Frantically unbuttoning with trembling hands, she barked: “Get out!”

Escaping gratefully, Guan Yu leaned against the door hearing bathroom sounds. “Should’ve used the bedpan,” he muttered.

A sudden yelp inside. “Xin-jie?!” He pressed against the door.

Having bumped her injured leg while rising, Feng Xin struggled to stand and pull up pants. Another stumble brought Guan Yu barging in blind. “Grab my arm!” she ordered.

Peeking as he helped, Guan Yu glimpsed yellow-tinged water. “Eyes shut!” Feng Xin hissed murderously.

Chapter 175: Discharge Time

Two days of this purgatory honed Guan Yu’s willpower. Gradually, he normalized the intimacy – mere patient care, nothing more. Feng Xin’s rapid recovery (thanks to stolen sugar stocks fueling his healing power) allowed her to hobble alone now.

The astounded hospital director nearly worshipped Guan Yu. Meanwhile, Feng Xin milked her recovery – demanding spoon-feeding, childish leg-blowing, constant attention. Compared to gentle Du Xiaojuan, this firebrand felt like night and day.

During apple-peeling, Feng Xin probed: “What’s your plans after dropping out?”

“Earn money.”

“By gambling? How’d you win my brother’s companies?”

“Luck.”

She eyed him skeptically but dropped it. As they packed, the director approached Guan Yu with reverent awe. “Time to go,” Guan Yu murmured. Feng Xin nodded quietly – both aware his miraculous healing couldn’t stay hidden.

Chapter 176: Benefactor

Arranging discharge, Feng Xin surprised Guan Yu by cooperating smoothly. Their unspoken understanding hung heavy – she’d glimpsed his secret, but asked nothing. As underlings handled paperwork, Guan Yu realized: true torture wasn’t seeing beauty unveiled, but witnessing vulnerability without crossing lines. Yet through the ordeal, an unspoken bond had taken root – thorny, complex, but undeniably real.
