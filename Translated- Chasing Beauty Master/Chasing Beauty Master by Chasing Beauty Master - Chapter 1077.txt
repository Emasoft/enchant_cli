“Both of you needn’t mind me. Go capture Fang Su at once!” Guan Yu commanded coldly. Never had he imagined this "Poisonous Widow," knowing full well she was outmatched, would order her subordinates to fight to the death for the sake of rescuing the Fang Family Head. Truly worthy of her title as one of the Ten Great Villains.

But since they had become enemies, there was no need for courtesy. Killing one meant one less foe. After Guan Yu spoke, Xue Jing did not move. Instead, she suggested, “Sister Jones, you go capture Fang Su. I’ll stay here to protect Guan Yu.”

Knowing arguments would not sway Xue Jing, Guan Yu reluctantly ordered, “Brother Shen Sheng, you three go with Jones to capture Fang Su. Be extremely wary of the Poisonous Widow’s schemes.”

Jones had already begun fighting her way toward the Fang residence. Around Guan Yu, members of the Freedom Organization clashed with Shadow Sun operatives.

Guan Yu directed his Yu Gang members to form tight groups of four, targeting isolated Shadow Sun fighters. Though the incense masters’ pistols provided intimidating firepower, Guan Yu forbade their use—brandishing the weapons to intimidate sufficed.

The strategy proved effective. Though all opponents were cultivators, some had low-level cultivation. Cornered by gun muzzles, many surrendered rather than risk death, allowing Guan Yu’s side to take prisoners.

The spectacle of hundreds battling was grand, yet the narrow road limited the Freedom Organization’s numerical advantage. With less than ten meters of width before the Fang estate, only front-line fighters could engage, leaving those behind to merely shout support.

The situation demanded elite intervention. When Jiang Fenju charged into the fray, the tide shifted instantly. Leading his brothers, Jiang carved through enemy ranks, forcing them back toward the Fang gates.

A’Gou, a formidable opponent, intercepted Jiang Fenju’s advance. Their clash scattered surrounding combatants, leaving the two elites dueling at the center while others watched helplessly from afar, unable to intervene without risking injury.

After several exchanges, both were flung back by mutual force. Jiang Fenju staggered but steadied himself, hands trembling visibly—clear signs he was outmatched by A’Gou.

Yet Jiang refused to yield, gritting his teeth and attacking anew. Guan Yu, seeing Jiang’s inevitable defeat, reluctantly ordered Xue Jing to assist. “Go help him. I’ll be safe here with the others. I won’t see Jiang grievously wounded.”

Guarded by Wei Hongwei, Wang Hu, and other pistol-bearing allies, Guan Yu remained protected. Xue Jing nodded, leaping over the crowd to join Jiang’s fight.

Meanwhile, Jones and three monks breached the Fang residence, only to find it guarded. While the monks engaged reinforcements, Jones confronted the Poisonous Widow directly.

“Hide somewhere safe. Do not flee through the back door,” the Poisonous Widow instructed her charges before clashing with Jones. Both women, having reached the First-Class Sovereign realm through harsh trials, fought fiercely.

“Surrender Fang Su, and I’ll spare you,” Jones offered.

“A joke! Handing him over would ruin my reputation. You’ll pass only over my corpse!” The Widow, unafraid of single combat, matched Jones blow for blow.

“Alone, I may struggle. But once my allies finish your men, can you withstand four of us? Don’t waste effort,” Jones warned.

“Take this!”

The Widow struck first, black qi swirling around her fists—a hallmark of First-Class Sovereign power. Jones countered, their collision echoing as both recoiled. Jones fared worse, her opponent’s opening strike carrying greater momentum.

Enraged, Jones conjured a pale qi shield—crude compared to Guan Yu’s techniques, yet impressive for its rarity. The Widow eyed it warily as they resumed combat, demolishing furniture with each strike.

Outside, Xue Jing’s aid eased Jiang Fenju’s burden. Injured hands rendered him ineffective, and Guan Yu ordered his retreat.

Examining Jiang’s trembling arms, Guan Yu advised, “Rest and heal. This injury needs time.”

Jiang nodded, shamed by his failure before Guan Yu. “I’ve failed. I’ll withdraw.”

“You’ve done your utmost. No one blames you. Superior foes exist—this is natural. Clear your mind to recover. I’ll need you again.” Guan Yu’s reassuring pat steadied Jiang’s resolve.

Ambitious and strength-obsessed, Jiang had risen through Freedom Organization ranks by relentless cultivation, driven partly by admiration for Jones. Though loyal now, Guan Yu recognized Jiang’s potential future threat should his power surpass Jones’.

Meanwhile, Shen Sheng’s trio subdued the Widow’s guards. “Move again, and my club smashes your skulls!” the bearded monk roared at fallen foes.

As Shen Sheng left to hunt Fang Su, the bearded monk charged the Widow, iron club whirling. “Eat this!”

The Widow dodged, realizing her disadvantage. Retreating, she nearly collided with Xiao Bai—lying in ambush. A dagger sliced her robe before she twisted away, counterattacking.

Xiao Bai retreated swiftly, reappearing elsewhere as the Widow reassessed. These specialized fighters—the club-wielder’s brute force, Xiao Bai’s speed—made prolonged combat untenable.

As the Widow fled, an unexpected figure blocked her escape—a rescue arrived.
