After everyone had shared another round of wine, Young Master Men inquired curiously, "Zhao the Second, why did you summon the proprietress here?"

Having rushed out, Xiaobao (Little Treasure) hurried to Xiliu's (Western Willow) chamber, where the madam was retouching her makeup. Seeing the flustered girl burst in, Xiliu asked, "What's happened? Why this panic?"

"Sister Liu," Xiaobao fretted, "those young masters insist on seeing you. When I asked their purpose, they berated me harshly. You must go!"

"Oh? Does the fare displease them?"

"Unlikely—they've not touched a bite. Could it be...we served too many dishes? The table's overflowing, yet there are only four of them." Even Xiaobao noticed the excess.

Xiliu's brows arched sharply. "Tch! Aren't they touted as Qujiang City's wealthiest scions? To quibble over petty expenses—how miserly!" She took pride in Echo Pavilion's specialties, confident their flavors held renown within the city walls.

She had hoped this lavish spread would secure the young masters' patronage, ensuring future visits.

Uncertain of the cause yet duty-bound, Xiaobao pressed, "Will you go, Sister Liu?"

Rising, Xiliu declared, "Let us face them together. I'll see what trifles provoke such fuss."

A woman yielding to neither threats nor flattery, Xiliu maintained dignity even when humoring clients. Though Echo Pavilion's survival demanded occasional deference, she refused to cower before unreasonable ruffians—even these so-called elite held no sway over her.

Entering the chamber with practiced grace, Xiliu smiled, "Young Masters, how may I assist you?"

Second Young Master Zhao snapped open his folding fan with a flourish. "Proprietress, count our number."

"Four gentlemen present," she replied, "plus an attendant at the door—five in total."

"Good. Now tally the dishes before us." He gestured at the overloaded table.

Xiliu's heart sank—the complaint was clear. *Rich skinflints! Must they nitpick over extra silver?* Yet observing the mountainous spread, even she winced. She'd instructed the kitchen to showcase their best dishes generously, never imagining this absurd excess. Four men needed a dozen courses at most, not thirty-odd platters!

*Disaster!* Her bid for loyal patronage had backfired. Such waste would repel rather than entice. *Blundering fools in the kitchen!* She seethed, vowing to later berate the staff, though truthfully, Xiaobao bore blame—the girl, eager for commissions, had urged endless dishes while the men admired jade pendants.

Swallowing pride, Xiliu forced composure. "Does our fare displease you? Rest assured—we'll charge only for ten courses. The rest are compliments of the house, honoring your esteemed patronage."

"Sister Liu?" Xiaobao gasped, aghast at this loss, but a glare silenced her.

Young Master Zhao blinked. "Why this generosity?"

Xiliu's cheek twitched. *Today's profits lie in ruins.* "Noble sirs, ten dishes suffice for four. Yet we wished you to sample Echo Pavilion's specialties, hoping you might frequent us and spread word of our fare. Thus, I bear this loss as investment."

Her ploy disarmed Zhao's prepared tirade. With excess declared complimentary, grievance dissolved.

"How extravagant!" Zhao thawed. "We cannot impose thus."

Qin Taijin, today's host, brightened. Though wealthy, he loathed waste. Relieved at reduced costs, he interjected, "Madam's kindness shames us. I'll cover all dishes—none should suffer loss."

*Idiot!* Men cursed inwardly. *Why pay when offered free fare? Drunken posturing!*

Zhao fumed—his confrontation rendered pointless.

Xiliu's eyes glinted. *Brainless moneybags!* Aloud, she demurred, "Noble Qin, I pledged ten courses. Shall we compromise? Accept twenty as gifts, you paying the remainder? This preserves my honor and your generosity."

Clever accounting—selecting priciest dishes for billing—would turn profit while flattering Qin's vanity.

"Your grace humbles me," Qin bowed, the picture of courtesy.

**Chapter 3447: A Loss-Making Venture**

Xiaobao exhaled in relief—her commission from twenty dishes proved substantial.

"Gratitude for Madam's hospitality," Zhao added, relieved Qin's drunkenness hadn't provoked worse.

Bowing, Xiliu withdrew. "By your leave, gentlemen."

**Chapter 3448: Sharing Drinks**

Alone with the men, Xiaobao brightened. "How else may I serve, Young Masters?"

"Any request?" Men leered.

Realizing her blunder, Xiaobao backpedaled, "I...provide arts alone. Should you desire...other companionship, I can summon specialists."

"Useless! Fetch girls prettier than yourself, or submit to me!" Men demanded.

Qin, flushed with wine, intervened, "Cease bullying the child! Drink!"

As cups clinked, Xiaobao plucked a pipa, soothing the revelry. Qin suddenly roared, "Tonight celebrates Men's jade acquisition! Shouldn't such treasure be shared?"

"Never!" Men slurred, clutching his pendant. "Keep your thieving hands off!"

Laughing, Qin changed tack: "Summon dancers! Wine demands spectacle!"

Eager to distract, Men agreed. Qin's gaze fell on Xiaobao. "Approach, girl."

Her heart raced—this was her chance. Though Qin reeked of liquor, his status outweighed Men's lechery. *Perhaps tonight secures my future...*

"Beauty unveiled!" Qin crowed, pawing her shoulder as she perched on his lap.

"Drunkard's eyes find every wench comely," Zhao muttered.

**Chapter 3449: Unreason**

"To private chambers!" Qin groped beneath Xiaobao's robes.

Disgusted, Men rose. "I take leave."

Zhao and his brother followed. "Enjoy your...entertainment."

Alone, Qin's hands wandered freely. Xiaobao, emboldened by wine, ceased resistance—her trembling subsiding into calculated compliance.
