Guan Yu turned to Lin Chen and said, “The two hundred taels I repaid for you won’t be forgotten. You must remember to return it. If I hadn’t stepped in, you’d have lost at least a leg by now! Also, depart immediately for the sect. Inform Master Xuan Ming of this matter and have him issue silver. We’ll await your return to continue our journey.”

Guan Yu unceremoniously delegated the task of retrieving funds to Lin Chen. After all, the mess was of his making. There was no reason for Guan Yu to deplete his own resources for this folly.

Once Lin Chen returned to the Yunqing Sect, how he explained things to Xuan Ming was none of Guan Yu’s concern. As long as the silver was secured, all would be well.

“Guan Yu, is it wise to entrust this to me? There are plenty here to send. Why must I personally make the trip?” Lin Chen grumbled, his tone laced with resentment now that his immediate danger had passed.

“You squandered all our silver and still have the gall to complain?” Guan Yu retorted. “Who else would traverse such a distance to clean up your mess? This is your responsibility alone.”

Ling Su approached and added, “Guan Yu speaks sense. You caused this disaster—why should others shoulder the consequences? Already you’ve delayed us. If this affects our mission’s timeline, how will you answer for it?”

Lin Chen glared at Ling Su with disdain. “What right do you have to judge? Need I remind you I gave you twenty taels to gamble yesterday? Now you turn on me so quickly?”

Ling Su shrugged. “You lost every last tael we had and piled on two hundred in debts. Yet you dare mention those twenty? Your audacity astounds me.”

Stung by the truth, Lin Chen fell silent. Under the collective weight of scornful gazes, he finally relented.

“Fine. I’ll return to the sect and beg Master for silver. Wait here—I’ll be back within a day.” His voice dripped with resignation.

**Chapter 4385: I’ll Listen to You**

“We’ll lodge at an inn west of the city,” Guan Yu instructed. “Upon your return, we’ll purchase camels and depart. Ensure you negotiate thoroughly with the Master. We can’t afford another shortage.”

As the group waited, Guan Yu and Lin Chen stepped outside to prepare a horse. “Senior Brother Lin,” Guan Yu said quietly, “rest assured—I’ll keep Ling Su away from Siqi in your absence.”

“Those are the finest words I’ve heard today.” Lin Chen nodded gratefully. “Watch him closely. That snake employs underhanded tricks.”

“Of course.” Guan Yu adopted a benevolent tone. “And don’t fret over the two hundred taels. Repay it when convenient. Travel safely.”

The words visibly moved Lin Chen. He clasped Guan Yu’s shoulder firmly. “My deepest thanks. Without your aid, I’d still be imprisoned. I swear to repay every tael.”

“One final warning,” Guan Yu added. “When reporting to the Master, avoid blunt truths. With your silver tongue, I trust you’ll manage?”

“But the Master will learn eventually! How else can I request funds without explaining?”

“Invent a tale. Honesty might secure silver but will surely bring disciplinary action. Take the safer path.”

Lin Chen’s eyes gleamed. “You’ve a plan, haven’t you? Share it.”

“Simplicity serves best,” Guan Yu mused. “Claim our funds were stolen en route. Without silver, we’re stranded. The urgency of reaching the desert before the seventh moon’s fifteenth day lends credence. Given the Master’s fondness for you, it should suffice.”

“But he’s shrewd! Such a flimsy story...”

“Play the desperate disciple,” Guan Yu urged. “His affection will override suspicion. Time is our ally here.”

“Very well. I’ll follow your counsel.” Lin Chen mounted his steed. “I’ll take sword flight beyond the city walls for speed.”

**Chapter 4386: Unreliable Affairs**

Guan Yu chose the western district for its abundance of camel merchants. With a day to spare, selections could be made leisurely.

Liaozhou City’s vastness ensured ample lodging. Privately, Guan Yu could easily fund their stay—sending Lin Chen on this errand served as punishment. Let the fool sweat while Siqi enjoyed peace.

The rift between Lin Chen and Ling Su pleased Guan Yu. Once inseparable allies, their rivalry over Siqi had shattered the bond. Capitalizing on this would isolate Ling Su further. Women, it seemed, remained the surest catalyst for male discord.

Before departure, Guan Yu had privately assured Lin Chen: Ling Su would be monitored, the debt could wait. Such “kindnesses” bound Lin Chen in gratitude—a leash of obligation. The fabricated debt (never actually repaid) and crafted alibi ensured Lin Chen’s compliance. Should the fool consider betrayal during his solo journey, these psychological shackles would stay his tongue.

The western gate’s sparse residential areas gave way to livestock markets. Camel pens dominated—essential for deep desert travel. A beast of burden here meant survival; without one, the arid wastes promised doom.

Zhou’s Inn, another establishment under Merchant Zhou’s empire, welcomed them. Upon learning of Guan Yu’s delay, Zhou Xiaoyu had arranged free lodging—a favor Guan Yu resolved to repay discreetly later.

**Chapter 4387: Unusual Rules**

Inquiries about premium camels proved futile—the innkeeper lacked expertise. Guan Yu resorted to personal inspection. Desert wisdom dictated: prioritize broad hooves over height.

Post-lunch, Guan Yu led Siqi, Aze, and Wang Jun to survey merchants. “Why not buy camels nearer the desert?” Siqi wondered as they walked.

“Local camels are renowned,” Guan Yu explained. “I’ve spotted good stock, but securing twenty requires multiple vendors.”

Wang Jun yawned. “Best wait for Lin Chen. That bungler’s never reliable.”

“He’ll deliver,” Guan Yu countered. “With Ling Su as rival, he’ll weigh consequences carefully now.”

Aze frowned. “How did those two turn from brothers to enemies?”

Guan Yu glanced at Siqi. “No permanent alliances exist. Circumstances shift people like desert sands.” Privately, he relished their schism—soon, neither would challenge his ascendance within the sect.

A commotion erupted ahead—gongs, drums, firecrackers. Crowds swarmed around a raised platform adorned with crimson banners. Golden characters proclaimed: “Zhao Family Bridal Contest.”

Wang Jun sneered. “Some homely spinster’s last resort, no doubt.”

“Or a beauty seeking worthy suitors,” Guan Yu countered. “Interested, Wang Jun? Prime chance to wed!”

The jest darkened Wang Jun’s mood—a sore subject since his... transformation. “Spare me. Let Aze play the fool.”

As they pushed through the throng, Guan Yu noted the twin posts anchoring the stage. A crimson scroll fluttered above, its gilded proclamation demanding attention.

“Adapt if it overwhelms you,” Guan Yu murmured to Siqi, knowing her aversion to crowds.

“I’ll manage,” she replied softly, following despite discomfort.

They secured a front view. Wang Jun snorted. “Look at those rules—probably demands the groom defeat ten champions blindfolded!”

Guan Yu studied the scroll. “Unconventional, indeed. Let’s observe before judging.” Around them, the crowd buzzed with speculation—a tempest of curiosity masking calculated designs.
