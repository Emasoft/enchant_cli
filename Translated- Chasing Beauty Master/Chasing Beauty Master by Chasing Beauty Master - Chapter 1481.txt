Magistrate Pang then arranged for over thirty soldiers to wait at the yamen's entrance. When Guan Yu emerged in his carriage, the magistrate noticed Wang Jun aboard and called out, "Young Master Jiang, given recent unrest in town, this humble official has assigned guards for your safety. They shall ensure your security."

This arrangement perfectly suited Guan Yu's intentions—the more guards Magistrate Pang assigned him, the fewer would remain at the yamen, facilitating their subsequent plans.

As the carriage rolled forward, Wang Jun sat idly outside instead of driving. Yamen soldiers took the reins, sparing him the effort. The procession, tightly guarded, wound through streets until reaching Liu Yun's home.

Liu Yun had nearly finished preparing dinner when hurried footsteps startled her. Peering outside, she nearly collapsed at the sight—the street choked with yamen soldiers flanking an opulent carriage. Frozen in shock, she barely registered Guan Yu and Wang Jun approaching until Guan Yu patted her shoulder. "Let's speak inside," he said warmly.

Once indoors, Liu Yun stood trembling by the doorway. Guan Yu chuckled, "What's wrong? Frightened by the guards? Fear not—Magistrate Pang provided escorts after our friendly chat."

Wang Jun eyed the laden table hungrily. "Such a feast! Let's eat while we talk."

Collecting herself, Liu Yun began, "When you left earlier—"

"Wait." Guan Yu silenced her with a gesture toward the door. Understanding, Liu Yun served rice bowls before whispering, "What truly transpires?"

Guan Yu explained succinctly, "We suspect yamen involvement. I posed as Young Master Jiang from official circles to investigate Magistrate Pang. Claimed you're distant kin needing visitation. Hence the guards."

"Keep silent on this," Wang Jun added. "After dining, we'll change clothes and covertly return to the yamen. Ignore any commotion outside."

Liu Yun wrung her hands. "But how will you depart unseen? Our home lacks back exits, and soldiers swarm the street!"

"We've methods," Guan Yu assured. "If they demand entry, feign deafness. We'll return swiftly."

Wang Jun nodded. "As the magistrate's honored guest, none dare intrude. Rest easy."

"Then hurry back safely," Liu Yun conceded. After the meal, as they prepared to leave, Xiaoyuan piped up: "Mama, I want to ride the big carriage!"

"Enough nonsense—off to bed!" Liu Yun scolded. Turning to the men, she warned, "That carriage reeks of danger."

While Wang Jun changed clothes, Guan Yu addressed dozing soldiers outside. "At ease, men. My kinsfolk and I have much to discuss. Rest while you wait."

A squad leader bowed. "As you command, Young Master."

Reentering, Guan Yu found Wang Jun pondering their exit. "Sword-flight from the courtyard risks detection," Wang Jun murmured. "Surrounded by neighboring homes..."

"Liu Yun," Guan Yu proposed, "distract them with water offerings. We'll slip away during the commotion."

"But our return?" Wang Jun countered.

Guan Yu lifted a bamboo whistle from Xiaoyuan's toys. "I'll signal our approach. Offer more water when you hear this."

Liu Yun nodded resolutely. "Many knew my late husband. This ruse should work."

As Liu Yun carried water buckets outside, calling "Drink up, honorable guards!", the men clustered gratefully around. Under night's cloak, two dark-clad figures soared skyward undetected.

Alighting on the yamen's rear rooftop, Guan Yu scanned the illuminated courtyards. "To the lumber pile," he whispered. Finding nothing amiss, Wang Jun frowned. "Have we been exposed? Perhaps operations halted during your 'visit'."

"Precisely. Let's split up—rendezvous here later." Guan Yu crept toward Magistrate Pang's suspected quarters, finally locating a guarded pavilion. Scaling its rear, he eavesdropped through shutters:

"...must pause operations, Young Master Li! If Jiang discovers our trade—" protested the magistrate's wheezy voice.

Within the opulent chamber, the corpulent official lounged on furs between bound women. Opposite sat a refined youth—Li Gongzi—massaged by a naked attendant. "You fret over trifles, Magistrate! Our buyers await these prime specimens. Delay risks silver and reputation!"

Guan Yu's eyes narrowed. Li Gongzi—the missing son from Li Manor! Here lay the conspiracy's heart: collusion between magistrate and gentry to kidnap women, "train" them as slaves, and sell to nobles. Liu Yun's husband had likely died uncovering this.

Li Gongzi sneered, "That Jiang fop merely tours for amusement. You cower like a hare!"

Magistrate Pang struck a captive woman savagely. "His Excellency Jiang's kin here? Too coincidental! Liu Yun's widow might've informed them. Your men killed her husband—did you think vengeance sleeps?"

"You drown in paranoia! Were Jiang truly investigating, he'd storm the yamen openly!"

Guan Yu's jaw tightened. Every cruelty confirmed his suspicions—the lumber pile's stillness meant victims already removed. But evidence lingered in this den of depravity. Tonight's discoveries would uproot this vile trade... if they survived to expose it.
