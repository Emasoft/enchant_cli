Chapter 4985: Abiding by the Rules

No longer caring about consequences, Guan Yu gripped the Imperial Seal in his left hand and summoned the Soulfall Blade with his right. Without hesitation, he unleashed every ounce of spiritual energy stored within the blade, determined to reclaim the floating symbols of the Eight-Drum Divine Art through sheer force. His jaw tightened as he even channeled his inner qi, merging both energies into a tempestuous storm.

At this moment, Guan Yu had unleashed his full power—spiritual energy and inner qi erupted simultaneously from his core. A domineering aura radiated outward, overwhelming everyone nearby. Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi, standing closest to him, felt the pressure most acutely.

To them, Guan Yu now resembled a primordial beast. An instinctive fear gripped their hearts, making each breath labored. The sheer intensity of his presence paralyzed them—Wang Xiaorong managed to steady herself slightly, but Qiqi trembled visibly, sweat beading on her forehead as if facing an executioner.

The expanding aura soon engulfed the entire Golden Hall, pulsating like a living entity on the verge of detonation. Outside, soldiers and onlookers gathered, awestruck by the unnatural radiance illuminating the palace—a dazzling interplay of golden and silver light that inspired both reverence and terror.

The palace guards, disciplined yet unnerved, halted at the periphery of Guan Yu’s energy field. None dared approach what they perceived as celestial intervention—perhaps gods descending to the mortal realm.

Sensing the overwhelming power, the golden symbols of the Eight-Drum Divine Art began drifting into the Imperial Seal. Slowly at first, then in a cascading flow, they surrendered to the artifact’s pull. By the time dawn tinged the eastern sky with pale light, every last symbol had been absorbed.

Drenched in sweat and exhaustion, Guan Yu immediately inspected the Imperial Seal’s interior. After confirming with the artifact’s spirit that the three divine arts had settled properly, he finally relaxed. This feat had drained him completely—both spiritually and physically.

“We can’t stay,” he urged, turning to Wang Xiaorong. “The guards will swarm here soon. Support me as we leave—quickly!”

As the trio soared above the palace rooftops, Qiqi suddenly gasped and pointed downward. From their aerial vantage, they saw the white stone dust scattered across the Golden Hall’s roof had arranged itself into cryptic verses:

*“Boundless azure seas,*
*Valley at world’s edge,*
*Dragon’s pearl awaits,*
*Divine art fulfilled.”*

Guan Yu memorized the lines, suspecting they hinted at the final divine art’s location. Before he could ponder further, familiar figures emerged near the palace gates—the Left Envoy of the Demonic Soul Sect, accompanied by elite warriors.

“Young Mistress,” the Left Envoy greeted Wang Xiaorong with a bow, protocol dictating his deference despite the tension. His companions glared at Guan Yu, hands twitching near their weapons.

“You’re too late,” Qiqi taunted, jerking her thumb toward the now-dim Golden Hall. “The spectacle’s over. All that’s left is rooftop scribbles.”

Ignoring her, the Left Envoy addressed Wang Xiaorong solemnly: “The Eight-Drum Divine Art—did he claim it?”

Before she could reply, Guan Yu interjected: “I did. Through considerable effort.”

A Demonic Soul elder stepped forward, snarling: “You dare take what belongs to our sect?!” His comrades shifted into combat stances, but the Left Envoy raised a restraining hand, awaiting Wang Xiaorong’s confirmation.

“It’s true,” she admitted, meeting his gaze. “But I stand with him. Any move against Guan Yu is a move against me.”

The Demonic Soul cultivators exchanged frustrated glances. “Young Mistress,” one pleaded, “the Sect Master’s orders were absolute. Returning empty-handed means our deaths!”

“Then die!” Wang Xiaorong’s voice turned glacial. “I’ll permit no harm to him.”

As the standoff intensified, new arrivals complicated matters—members of the Crimson Lotus Sect, led by the sneering Yue Jing and Lai Lixia.

“Well, well,” Yue Jing drawled, spotting Guan Yu amidst the Demonic Soul forces. “Consorting with demons now, Cloudgreen disciple? How treasonous.”

Guan Yu smirked. “Better a demon’s company than fools who can’t recognize imminent danger. Tell me—do your masters know they sent two idiots to hunt divine arts?”

“You—!” Lai Lixia sputtered.

“Look around,” Guan Yu cut in. “Demonic Soul elites surround us. Do you truly think they’ll let Crimson Lotus witnesses walk free?”

Yue Jing paled, realizing their predicament. Guan Yu pressed the advantage: “Run and tattle to your sect if you survive. But first—try escaping these wolves.”

The Demonic Soul elders bristled, their killing intent thickening the air. Yet Wang Xiaorong’s unwavering stance created an invisible barrier—a stalemate where neither side dared strike first.

Chapter 4986: Who Dares Move

The Left Envoy sighed inwardly. With the Young Mistress shielding Guan Yu, direct confrontation was impossible. Yet returning to the Sect Master without the divine art spelled doom. His subordinates’ anxious whispers mirrored his turmoil.

“Young Mistress,” an elder implored, “this isn’t mere rivalry! That art could shift the balance of power! How can you prioritize an outsider over your own blood?”

Wang Xiaorong’s voice quivered with suppressed emotion: “I won’t watch him die. Nor will I see my father harmed. There must be another way.”

“There isn’t!” another snapped. “Choose now—stand aside or be branded a traitor!”

Before she could retort, Guan Yu laughed—a sharp, mocking sound. “Traitor? She protects both sides from your stupidity. Attack me, and the Demonic Soul Sect loses its heir. Retreat, and your master’s wrath awaits. Your dilemma amuses me.”

The Crimson Lotus disciples edged backward, sensing the impending storm. Yue Jing hissed: “Let them kill each other. We’ll claim the spoils.”

“Fools,” Guan Yu muttered. “You’re already dead.”

As if on cue, the Left Envoy’s blade flashed—not at Guan Yu, but toward the Crimson Lotus interlopers. “Silence witnesses first!” he barked. Chaos erupted as sect loyalties shattered into free-for-all combat.

Chapter 4987: Two Useless Trash

Amidst clashing steel, Guan Yu pulled Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi into a defensive formation. The Crimson Lotus disciples—utterly outmatched—fell within moments, their blood staining the cobblestones. Yue Jing and Lai Lixia gaped at their slain comrades, finally understanding their folly.

“You... you monsters!” Lai Lixia screeched, backing away.

“Monsters?” Guan Yu parried a Demonic Soul elder’s strike, his blade singing. “You invited this when you coveted what you couldn’t control.”

Yue Jing made a desperate lunge toward Guan Yu, only to be disarmed instantly. “Pathetic,” Guan Yu sneered, kicking him into a wall. “Your sect breeds incompetence. Tell me—did they send you hoping you’d die?”

The Left Envoy, momentarily pausing his assault, growled: “Enough theatrics! Hand over the divine art, and we spare your—”

“No.” Wang Xiaorong’s spiritual energy flared, forming a protective barrier. “Leave. Now. That’s an order.”

The Demonic Soul forces hesitated, torn between obedience and survival instinct. Finally, the Left Envoy sheathed his weapon. “This isn’t over,” he warned Guan Yu. “The Sect Master will hear of this.”

As the Demonic Soul contingent retreated, Guan Yu glanced at the trembling Crimson Lotus duo. “Run,” he said coldly. “And pray we never meet again.”

The two scrambled away, their earlier bravado reduced to whimpering fear. Qiqi giggled. “Worthless indeed.”

“Let’s go,” Wang Xiaorong urged, her face pale. “Before more come.”

Nodding, Guan Yu gazed eastward where the first sunrays pierced the horizon. Somewhere beyond those mountains lay answers—and greater perils. Clutching the Imperial Seal, he soared into the dawn, two loyal shadows following.
