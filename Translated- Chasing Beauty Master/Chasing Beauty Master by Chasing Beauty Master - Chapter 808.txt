“Is this supposed to be a bedroom arranged inside a toilet?” Guan Yu couldn’t comprehend the purpose of such interior design.

This place bore no resemblance to where the Ten Thousand-Year Demonic Realm should be stored. With time pressing, Guan Yu resolved to hasten his departure and search elsewhere.

Just then, the woman sleeping soundly on the floor between them let out a soft moan. She rolled over and sat up, her head bowed, cascades of naturally curled hair spilling messily over her shoulders, obscuring her face.

Guan Yu startled, fearing she’d heard his movements. As he braced to act, he watched her push aside the blanket and stumble drowsily to her feet. Swaying unsteadily, she shuffled toward the toilet in the room.

Clad in an ultrathin, scandalously short purple nightgown, she sauntered toward the toilet with her alluring figure, sitting backward on the seat. The hem of her brief gown rested precisely at the curved edge, revealing nothing despite its brevity.

Guan Yu’s eyes bulged in frustrated disappointment. *Her nightgown’s craftsmanship is truly diabolical—just the right length to avoid adjustments when using the toilet.*

Trapped between action and inaction, Guan Yu agonized. Moving risked alerting her with noise, while staying put meant she’d face his direction upon returning. Thankfully, the room’s darkness offered hope she might not spot him.

“Damn your weak kidneys, waking to piss in the dead of night,” Guan Yu muttered, palms sweating as her prolonged bathroom visit stretched his nerves.

After what felt like an eternity, she fumbled for toilet paper, wiped herself, tossed it into the bin, flushed, and began walking toward him. Guan Yu’s pulse quickened. Holding his breath, he gathered energy in his palms, ready to strike as she passed her bedding and approached directly. Suddenly, a fragrant, serpentine body coiled around his neck.

“How marvelous…the dream continues…so vivid…” she slurred sleepily against his ear.

*Is she sleepwalking?* Guan Yu tensed as the fragrant woman entangled him limb-for-limb. His suspicion flared—*Could this be a ruse to ambush me?*

“Come now…it’s just a dream…don’t be shy…” she murmured, guiding his hand beneath her nightgown.

In this proximity, Guan Yu finally saw her face—porcelain skin framing exquisite features, soul-stealing eyes beneath melancholic brows, long upturned lashes, and a doll-like mouth exhaling sweet breaths.

Whether from his abrupt touch or her own arousal, she jolted awake, eyes widening as her lips parted to scream. Before the sound escaped, Guan Yu crushed his mouth against hers.

Her rigid body instantly melted. Seizing the moment, he released soporific incense into the air and gently laid her back on the bedding.

“This is only a dream…only a dream…” he whispered. Succumbing to the fumes, she sank into deep slumber.

Guan Yu bolted from the room, exhaling sharply. *That vixen’s sheer allure could derail empires.* But carnal temptations would wait—urgent matters demanded attention.

After fruitlessly combing the main hall for hidden compartments likely concealing the Ten Thousand-Year Demonic Realm, he headed south. Earlier, he’d spotted a chained door leading underground in the south building—a promising lead.

But dawn approached. With time exhausted, Guan Yu abandoned the search. To avoid alerting the Feng family, he returned to the surveillance room, donned his stealth suit, and leapt through the window into the forest.

Daybreak neared. Back at the Sun residence, Jin Hua heard his return but remained calm—her computer now displayed all security feeds.

Changing clothes, Guan Yu visited her room. Though curious about his nocturnal activities, Jin Hua refrained from prying. Her life belonged to him—the man who’d saved her, whom she loved beyond reason.

Finding her awake, he asked, “Hungry? Did I wake you?”

“No. I’d slept enough.”

“I went to the Feng estate seeking their Ten Thousand-Year Demonic Realm to cure Ling’er’s father. Failed.” He sat beside her.

“Such treasures aren’t lightly guarded. Without knowing their layout, how could you succeed?”

Guan Yu conceded impatience. “I’ll fetch breakfast soon. Wait here.” Jin Hua nodded gratefully.

Returning to Qiaoyuan District, he showered and changed by 7 AM. Days-old clothes demanded replacement.

“Uncle! My snacks ran out! Where’ve you been? Trying to bore me to death?” Zhang Han launched herself into his arms.

The little imp’s presence magnetized attention. “Your snacks are here,” he gestured to a bulging plastic bag.

“Yay! Best uncle ever!” She planted a loud kiss on his cheek before diving into her loot.

Foreseeing her demands, Guan Yu had shopped while buying Jin Hua’s breakfast—wise precaution against the tyke’s clinginess.

**Chapter 2050: Moving on a Rainy Day**

Watching Zhang Han spill snacks across the floor, Guan Yu mused, *What if this adorable child truly is a demon? Would her memories erase this innocence?*

Her charm transcended looks—an eternal child at heart. Briefly, he wished her past stayed buried. Yet mysteries demanded solving, and Jin Hua’s hopes for reviving her clan through legendary treasures couldn’t be ignored.

Departing, Guan Yu declined Ah Mei’s breakfast offer—he needed to meet Qing Ling’er.

At her residence, knocking yielded no response. Calling, he learned, “Mom and I sent Dad off early. We’re breakfasting out.”

Too late. He’d hoped to secure Qing Guanghui’s contact for future coordination regarding the Demonic Realm.

Joining them, Guan Yu asked, “Why did Mr. Qing leave so early?”

“To avoid detection,” Ling’er explained. “They departed at five. Mom returns to the countryside today.”

“Why not stay here for care?” he urged.

“I’ve begged her!” Ling’er sighed. “But she worries over our rural home. Thieves would regret robbing that hovel!”

“Child, it’s our roots. If you lose work again…” her mother countered.

Respecting their decision, Guan Yu left to collect Jin Hua’s meal.

Her complexion improved despite the brewing storm. “Royal Garden cuisine—does it please Her Majesty?” he teased.

“Anything from you delights me. But such rich food will fatten me!” She fed him a meat slice.

“Plumpness suits women—except bellies. If you swell, I’ll devour you.”

Their flirtation ended as rain lashed windows. A call interrupted Guan Yu’s nap—Lü Mei’s voice crackled:

“Scoundrel! You told me to move to Qiaoyuan! Uncle Wang’s hauling luggage in this downpour! Where’s the welcome party?”

“Rainmoving? I’m out! Call the others!”

Realizing Lü Mei lacked his housemates’ numbers, he phoned Xue Jing: “Why’s no one answering the gate?”

“Oh! Zhang Han’s obsessed with a new game! We’re watching—buy us proper gaming PCs later!”

“Forget games! Lü Mei’s outside!”

Rushing downstairs, Xue Jing found a black Mercedes at the gates. Uncle Wang, drenched but dignified, hauled luggage inside while Lü Mei scampered under an orange umbrella.

“Rotten timing!” she fumed, entering.

Xue Jing chuckled. “Should’ve warned us! Guan’s away.”

“Ugh! Wanted to surprise the jerk!”

Ah Mei appeared, beaming. “Rain during moving’s auspicious! Symbolizes overflowing prosperity!”

Welcoming Lü Mei, she noticed icy hands. “You’re freezing! I’ll make ginger tea!”

As Wang departed, Xue Jing asked, “Which room? Upstairs has space near ours.”

“Any sunny, airy spot.”

“Join our game?” Xue Jing gestured upstairs.

In Zhang Han’s room, “Super Little Cutie”—a red-robed sprite wielding a crystal staff—battled a giant spider alongside warriors. The child’s focus remained unbroken.

Lü Mei observed, intrigued despite never gaming before. The screen’s crimson-clad mage unleashed dazzling spells against the monstrous arachnid, her avatar’s name glowing: *Super Little Cutie*.
