Thus, he secretly ordered his subordinates to attack the Bulu Clan first, anticipating the Ha Clan’s inevitable assistance. By setting a trap within the Bulu Clan’s territory, they aimed to capture members of the Ha Clan.

They believed torturing the Ha Clan captives would reveal information about the legendary manual. However, contrary to Xiaomei’s expectations, the one sent to aid the Bulu Clan was not Ma Zhagen, but Hada Bei. It was likely Hada Bei knew nothing of the manual.

Xiaomei then resorted to bewitching both Ma Zhagen and Hada Bei, thoroughly manipulating them. She even drove Hada Bei—a man bound by familial devotion—to betray his clan.

Earlier, after capturing Hada Bei in Bulu territory, Xiaomei had attempted to seduce him using the same methods she employed on Ma Zhagen, hoping to extract secrets about the Ha Clan’s manual. Yet no clues regarding Guan Yu’s manual emerged.

Knowing the Ha Clan would mobilize to rescue Hada Bei, Xiaomei prepared meticulously. After arranging the Jiayi Sect’s affairs, she returned to the Ha Clan and discovered Ma Zhagen planned to lead over two hundred men to rescue their kin and annihilate the Jiayi Sect. Seizing this opportunity, Xiaomei ordered the Jiayi Sect to abandon their original base and establish a new encampment. By the time Ma Zhagen arrived, only empty tents remained.

Meanwhile, as Ma Zhagen’s forces departed, Xiaomei gathered her troops to launch a surprise assault on the Ha Clan. Everything proceeded smoothly: the Ha Clan was decimated, their chieftain and hostages captured. Xiaomei hoped to either extract the manual’s whereabouts through torture or force Ma Zhagen to trade the manual for the prisoners.

No one anticipated events spiraling beyond control. Ma Zhagen now faced a dire choice: attempt a futile rescue and risk the hostages’ execution, or flee. Hada Bei’s deathbed revelation—that Xiaomei herself led the Jiayi Sect—left Ma Zhagen reeling. The woman he adored, whose absence tormented him, was his greatest enemy, responsible for slaughtering his kin and destroying his home.

Upon returning to the Ha Clan, Ma Zhagen learned their allies had rescued a few captives during his confrontation with the Jiayi Sect—though the chieftain remained imprisoned. Devastated by Xiaomei’s betrayal and his own blindness to her deceit over months, Ma Zhagen grappled with conflicting emotions: love, hatred, and paralyzing indecision.

The next day, Guan Yu and his companions arrived at the Ha Clan’s ravaged settlement, finding it as desolate as the Bulu Clan’s ruins.

“We do not welcome outsiders here. Leave at once,” Ma Zhagen coldly addressed Guan Yu. “Ling Su isn’t present. Seek him elsewhere if you wish to confront him.”

Undeterred, Guan Yu replied, “We came from the Bulu Clan, hearing of your plight. We seek to unite against the Jiayi Sect. Together, we can end their tyranny.”

Ma Zhagen frowned. “You hold a grudge against them?”

“Indeed,” Guan Yu lied. “A senior brother of mine was killed by their hands. I seek vengeance.” His true aim, however, was to extract information about Miaocheng from the Jiayi Sect’s leader.

After consideration, Ma Zhagen relented. “Very well. Follow me inside. Perhaps we can ally ourselves.”

**Chapter 4523: Thus It Was Decided**

Guan Yu marveled at the Ha Clan’s towering wooden pagoda—a testament to their ingenuity in the harsh desert. After introductions, Ma Zhagen asked, “Do you have a strategy against the Jiayi Sect?”

“We are cultivators,” Guan Yu explained. “But we require your cooperation. Your warriors must engage their frontline forces while we support from behind with spells and shields. Together, we amplify each other’s strengths.”

Ma Zhagen’s expression darkened. “You expect us to be cannon fodder?”

“Not at all,” Guan Yu countered. “Without combined efforts, neither side can prevail. Your warriors’ might paired with our magic will turn the tide. We will enhance your resilience and strike from afar.”

Convinced, Ma Zhagen agreed. “Then we attack tomorrow.”

“Agreed. With unity, victory is certain,” Guan Yu affirmed.

Though the Ha Clan had suffered losses, their core forces remained intact. That night, Guan Yu’s group rested in warm felt tents, shielded from the desert winds.

“Do you think the Jiayi Sect’s leader is a demon?” Siqi asked. “If Miaocheng is a demon city, only they could sense its emergence on the Ghost Festival.”

“Likely,” Guan Yu mused. “Once we capture their leader, he’ll lead us to Miaocheng. All signs point to its appearance this year.”

As Siqi questioned the Jiayi Sect’s motives for targeting both clans, Guan Yu recounted rumors of the Ha Clan’s legendary manual—a text granting longevity and peerless strength, explaining their warriors’ prowess.

Too weary for further speculation, Guan Yu resolved to investigate the pagoda’s ancient well. That night, his soul unexpectedly separated from his body—an uncontrolled astral projection.

**Chapter 4524: Whispers of Deception**

The well’s depths revealed a vast underground river, its waters defying the arid surroundings. Yet Guan Yu’s spirit could not penetrate the water—a limitation to ponder later.

Meanwhile, Xiaomei—masked as the Jiayi Sect’s leader—confronted the Ha Clan’s imprisoned chieftain. “Surrender the manual, or watch your people die.”

“It does not exist!” the chieftain pleaded as a child was slain. Desperate pleas from kin followed, but he could not conjure myths into reality.

“Lies!” Xiaomei hissed. “Your clan’s strength and longevity defy nature. The manual *must* exist.”

Unbeknownst to her, the Ha Clan’s vigor stemmed not from ancient secrets, but adaptations forged in desert survival—a truth lost to legend’s distortions. As another child’s fate hung in balance, the chieftain’s anguish deepened, trapped between mercy and a phantom treasure.
