“Just a woman,” Manor Lord Lu mused, finding no issue with offering her to Yanzao. With a jovial chuckle, he called out, “Xiao Hui, come here.”

The maidservant had already noticed Yanzao’s piercing gaze earlier—those sharp eyes that seemed to slice through her like blades. Hearing her lord’s summons, she hurried over.

“What does the Manor Lord command?” Xiao Hui asked softly upon approaching.

“Why are you standing idle? Quickly pour wine for our honored guest,” Manor Lord Lu commanded. “Young Master Yanzao is the chief disciple of the Cloud Azure Sect and our most esteemed visitor. Attend to him properly.”

“As you wish, my lord.”

Xiao Hui approached, lifted the wine jar, and filled the cup before Yanzao. The young master’s predatory gaze never left her figure.

“Please enjoy, Young Master,” she murmured after pouring.

Yanzao’s yellowed teeth gleamed as he ogled her delicate hands. Unable to resist, he reached out to touch her. The sudden contact startled Xiao Hui—her grip on the wine jar faltered, nearly dropping it as her entire body trembled.

“Oh ho! Such smooth skin!” Yanzao leered, raising his cup toward her lips. “Come, little beauty, drink with this young master!”

Xiao Hui shook her head hastily. “Forgive me, Young Master. This servant cannot drink.” She bowed deeply, subtly retreating.

“No need for modesty! This grand manor has plenty of beds should you get tipsy.” Yanzao stood with a sly grin, thrusting the cup closer. “One sip won’t hurt.”

Unbeknownst to her, he had laced the wine with knockout powder. A single sip would render her unconscious within moments.

Manor Lord Lu observed this vulgar display with concealed distaste. Though doubting Yanzao’s claimed status as a sect disciple, he prioritized appeasing his guest. “Xiao Hui,” he coldly interjected, “this honor surpasses ten lifetimes’ fortune. Drink.”

Trembling, the maid knelt. “My lord, I truly cannot—”

“Fool! Will wine kill you? It’s not poison!” The lord’s finger jabbed accusingly.

Xiao Hui’s expression shifted. Rising calmly, she assumed a coy smile. “Since my lord commands... Young Master, allow this humble servant to share your cup. But drinking alone lacks charm. Won’t you join me?”

She procured another cup, filled both, and drained hers in one gulp. Violent coughs wracked her frame as Yanzao roared with laughter.

“Now that’s spirit!” He gulped his own cup, unaware he’d consumed his drugged wine. Xiao Hui refilled both men’s cups repeatedly, her demeanor transforming—seven cups later, she remained steady while Yanzao’s eyelids grew heavy.

“Young Master,” she whispered at his ear, “does your head feel heavy? Sleepy perhaps?”

Yanzao slumped in his chair, limbs leaden. “Impossible... I’ve better tolerance...” His words slurred.

“Did you forget what you added to the first cup?” Her eyes flashed steel briefly. “A tonic for men, perhaps?”

Realization struck too late—he’d drunk his own knockout draught. With a final thud, his face hit the table.

Manor Lord Lu glanced over at the noise. “What befell Young Master Yanzao?”

“He overindulged,” Xiao Hui demurred. “Let others escort him to rest. I’ll attend you, my lord.”

**Chapter 3759: The Failed Assassination**

The lord’s gaze lingered on Xiao Hui’s comely features, particularly the “two rabbits” bouncing beneath her robes. Earlier reluctance vanished—Yanzao’s stupor meant he could keep this prize.

After dismissing others, Xiao Hui massaged his shoulders. “Does this please my lord?”

“Excellently done.” He grasped her hand, marveling at its softness. “Come closer. Let me admire—”

Her other hand flashed steel—a dagger aimed at his back! But Lu anticipated, kicking his chair backward to send her crashing against the wall.

“Whore!” He stood sober and cold. “Your acting faltered when ordering servants about. No maid commands here.”

Xiao Hui clutched her ribs, coughing blood. As a Demon Soul Sect operative trained without martial arts to avoid detection, failure meant death. She bit her poison capsule—but Lu’s slap sent her sprawling, the capsule ripped from her mouth.

“Death comes when I permit it!” He crushed the capsule underfoot. “First, every man in this manor will enjoy you. We have two hundred guards. Anticipate thorough... hospitality.”

As guards dragged her to the dungeons, Guan Yu and Xiao Zhi returned through night patrols.

“Strange,” Guan Yu mused. “With demon sect threats, security seems lax.”

“Let’s rest,” Xiao Zhi urged. Entering Guan Yu’s chamber, he proposed sharing quarters for safety. Reluctantly agreeing, Guan Yu noticed Xiao Zhi contacting his father via black ingot—Senior Zheng’s hologram appeared.

After reporting events, Senior Zheng warned: “The manor lord isn’t to be lightly accused. Though rumors link him to demonic trades years ago, recent deeds earned respect. Tread carefully.”

As the transmission ended, both pondered—what truth lay beneath Tiger Jaw Manor’s gilded surface?
