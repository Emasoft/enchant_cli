When Jia Bo saw Jiang Fenju enter and take control of the situation, he couldn't help but admire the competence of these subordinates. After all, this was a cultivator organization—far more formidable than the campus thugs they usually dealt with.

"Blocked the road?" Guan Yu asked curiously, having just heard about the situation.

"Yeah," Jia Bo explained. "They piled dirt mounds to block the mountain path. Those bastards deliberately cut off our route to stop us from reinforcing you. Seems they were dead set on taking you down today, boss. We can't let them off easy."

Guan Yu glanced at Bill Lin, knowing full well who had orchestrated the roadblock. "Young Master Bill," he said coolly, "went through all this trouble to seal the paths. Planning to settle down here with me?"

Bill Lin offered an apologetic smile, his earlier arrogance gone. "My deepest apologies. This was my mistake. But surely someone of your stature won't dwell on such trivial matters?"

"I’ll overlook other issues since I’ve suffered no losses," Guan Yu replied. "But my brothers here climbed the mountain with great difficulty. Don’t you think you should... compensate them?"

Jia Bo and Wei Hongwei exchanged glances, their eyes gleaming. Here it comes—the boss was starting his extortion routine. They never left empty-handed.

"What do you mean?" Bill Lin feigned confusion. "Don’t tell me Guan Yu of Huayu Group is short on funds? Though I’ve lost today, must you embarrass yourself like this?" Everyone knew the chairman of Huayu Group lacking money was laughable.

**Chapter 2600: Vanished Into Thin Air**

"I may not need cash," Guan Yu said impassively, "but my brothers do. If you refuse, your safe departure today isn’t guaranteed."

Jia Bo chimed in, "We’re desperate for money! Can’t even afford to court girls. Don’t disappoint us, Young Master Bill."

Seeing the hostile gazes around him, Bill Lin knew he had to pay. Money was the easiest solution for someone of his status. "Fine. How much?"

Instead of answering, Guan Yu turned to Jia Bo. "Why so few men?"

"Ah, boss," Jia Bo sighed theatrically, "our gang’s stretched thin. This was all we could mobilize—no official vehicles either. The brothers complain daily."

Guan Yu nodded. "Perfect. Since Young Master Bill is here, I’m sure he’ll provide each brother with a car and a girl. Twenty million should suffice." He smiled at Bill Lin. "Any objections?"

Bill Lin’s cheek twitched. "This is robbery!"

Though he could afford it, the sum stung. Jia Bo muttered, "Some haggle over traffic fines but splurge on women. Priorities..."

"Surely this pittance means nothing to you?" Guan Yu pressed.

"Twenty million isn’t trivial to anyone," Bill Lin countered. "How about a discount?"

Laughter erupted. Guan Yu chuckled. "No negotiations."

Amid the jeers, Bill Lin’s face darkened. Two million vanishing into thin air—who wouldn’t resent that? Swallowing his pride, he gestured to Feng sprawled on the ground. "Shouldn’t Feng cover this?"

"Wait." Guan Yu’s voice cut through. "Your twenty million is separate. Feng and I have another account to settle..."

Both young masters paled. Guan Yu hid a smirk. Today’s windfall would be legendary.

Feng had hoped to evade responsibility but now realized Guan Yu intended to bleed them both dry. Though outrageous, neither could protest—Bill Lin lacked Feng’s submissiveness.

"You think this excessive?" Bill Lin snapped. "What if I refuse?"

"Excessive?" Guan Yu’s expression turned glacial. "You brought an army to kill me. Only my brothers’ strength thwarted you. Who’s excessive here? Think this is a game? No payment? Then leave a leg behind!"

Bill Lin sneered, "You dare touch me?"

"Test me." Guan Yu barked, "Jiang! Take his leg!"

Jiang Fenju seized a machete. As the blade descended, Bill Lin froze—until terror overrode pride. He collapsed to his knees. "Mercy! I’ll pay!"

"Wise choice." Guan Yu smiled. Jia Bo taunted, "Know your place!"

Bill Lin’s bodyguards stared—their arrogant young master, reduced to this. Feng understood too well, recalling his own humiliation by Guan Yu’s hands.

After Jiang withdrew, Guan Yu mockingly chided, "Help Young Master Bill up! We should thank our generous patron. Now—cash or check?"

**Chapter 2601: Don’t Scare Me**

Bill Lin’s thoughts mirrored Feng’s past rage—every witness to his shame must die. Born to privilege, he’d never groveled. Now his pride lay shattered before subordinates.

Trembling with suppressed fury, he rasped, "Cash is impractical. A check?"

Guan Yu ignored him, turning to Feng. "What was it you said earlier? My memory’s hazy."

Feng lifted his head, mustering defiance. "Stop bluffing, Guan Yu! Kill me if you dare!"

"Admirable spine." Guan Yu nodded to Jiang. "Grant his wish—slowly."

A scream rent the air as Jiang snapped Feng’s arm. "You’ll die tomorrow if I perish here!" Feng roared.

Another crack—his other arm broke. Guan Yu coldly ordered, "Continue."

"Wait!" Feng gasped, sweat-drenched. "Name your price!"

"Ten million. Consider it... trauma compensation."

Feng grimaced. "I don’t carry that sum."

"Borrow from your friend." Guan Yu glanced at Bill Lin, who reluctantly agreed. Checks changed hands.

As Feng staggered out, Guan Yu distributed the spoils—ten million to Jones’ organization, the rest to his gang. "Upgrade our vehicles and gear. No excuses next time."

Wei Hongwei clutched the checks, ecstatic. "Consider it done, boss!"

**Chapter 2602: I Have an Idea**

Exhausted from the day’s theatrics, Guan Yu massaged his sore arms. Tonight’s haul would strengthen his faction considerably. But as the courtyard emptied, a new thought struck—one requiring Jones’ expertise.

"Stay a moment," he called. "There’s something we need to discuss..."
