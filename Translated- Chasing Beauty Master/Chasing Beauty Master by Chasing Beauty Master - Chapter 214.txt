He did not activate his healing system. First, he lacked sufficient energy. After the intense, prolonged battle earlier, his energy reserves were nearly depleted. Second, the actions of Wan Qianshan and Huang Ming had completely ignited the fury in his heart.

If not for his strong will to survive and the gravity system, Huang Ming’s two gunshots would have condemned him to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. He never imagined Wan Qianshan would strike so viciously and decisively.

Though injured, he resolved to leave his mark on Huang Ming as well—otherwise, the loss would be too great.

Seeking vengeance, he channeled all remaining energy into the gravity system. Having witnessed Huang Ming’s strength, he dared not waste a single drop of energy, ensuring he could unleash his full combat potential.

He gasped for breath.

Huang Ming, however, seized the initiative. Though slower than Guan Yu, his movements were steady, each step measured and precise.

Within moments, he closed in on Guan Yu.

Guan Yu’s expression hardened. Instinctively, he lashed out with a right-legged kick.

*Hmph.*

A pained grunt escaped Guan Yu’s lips as he staggered back two steps.

*Strike while the iron is hot.* This time, it was Huang Ming who pressed the assault. Fists clenched, he unleashed a barrage of punches and kicks, leaving no opening unpunished.

With each collision, Guan Yu retreated another two steps.

“You bastard!” Guan Yu cursed through gritted teeth.

He had personally experienced Huang Ming’s formidable skills, but this man fought with no honor. While experts supposedly adhered to fair combat—no attacks below the belt, no targeting injuries, no exploiting disparities like firearms—Huang Ming’s tactics defied all such principles.

Huang Ming’s ruthless approach stemmed from his environment. Though society preached peace, his world thrived on bloodshed. Survival justified any means; notions of “honorable combat” were mere dung to him.

Had he clung to such ideals, he’d have died countless times over.

During their clash, Huang Ming assaulted both his upper and lower body, ruthlessly targeting the wounds on his legs.

Guan Yu could only endure, teeth clenched.

Blood gushed from his wounds, flowing faster and fiercer.

As he retreated, a trail of crimson marked his path—a gruesome testament to the battle.

**Chapter 532: A Woman’s Prowess Matches a Man’s**

Guan Yu faltered step by step, while Huang Ming showed no mercy.

Guan Yu’s disadvantage grew absolute, his plight worsening with each passing moment.

Huang Ming fought with rising ferocity, while Guan Yu’s face paled, his body weakening. Energy depletion and blood loss took their toll.

Finally, Guan Yu backed into a wall—nowhere left to retreat.

Cornering him meant the fight’s end.

Huang Ming’s expression remained impassive—no triumph at victory, no shame at underhanded tactics. His sole purpose: obey Wan Qianshan’s order to cripple Guan Yu.

Planting his feet, Huang Ming leapt into the air, right leg extended like an axe, aiming to split Guan Yu’s skull.

A direct hit would doom Guan Yu beyond paralysis—to a vegetative state.

Gritting his teeth, Guan Yu felt profound helplessness for the first time, yet refused to yield. He prepared for one final, desperate strike.

*A gunshot rang out—ill-timed.* The bullet flew toward Guan Yu, but its true target was Huang Ming mid-air.

Huang Ming’s survival instincts flared. Sensing lethal danger, he twisted unnaturally in mid-air, leveraging gravity to alter his trajectory.

*Bang!*

Sparks erupted as the bullet struck the wall.

Huang Ming caught his balance with a palm to the floor, then lunged like a cannonball toward the shooter.

He was fast—but Guan Yu faster.

A kick severed Huang Ming’s path.

Straightening, Huang Ming halted. It was too late: Li Xi now pressed her pistol to Wan Qianshan’s temple.

Guan Yu slumped, gasping heavily, staring in shock at Li Xi’s frosty expression.

He’d expected to die here today. Yet at the final moment, Li Xi had saved him. Her steady grip and calm demeanor—like a seasoned shooter—astounded him.

Long-term shooters developed calloused hands, yet Li Xi’s remained soft and fair. The mystery nagged at him, but there was no time to ponder.

Though Wan Qianshan was hostage, his men still aimed two guns at Li Xi. The situation remained precarious.

Blood continued spurting from Guan Yu’s thigh, yet he still withheld activating his healing system. In this delicate standoff, caution ruled.

“A woman’s prowess matches a man’s. Miss Li proves bolder than I imagined,” Wan Qianshan sneered.

His focus had been wholly absorbed by Guan Yu and Huang Ming’s duel. Initially vigilant, he’d grown engrossed watching Guan Yu dodge bullets and clash evenly with Huang Ming—giving Li Xi her opening.

“We’re leaving,” Li Xi stated flatly.

“He injured my man. You point a gun at me. Why should I let you go?” Wan Qianshan narrowed his eyes.

“Because I’m pointing a gun at your head.” Her arm remained steady, not a tremor in sight.

Wan Qianshan scoffed. “Two guns aim at *your* head.”

“What does it matter? We both die. I’ll trade my life for yours. Would you?” Her tone was breezy, as if discussing routine.

“Would you dare shoot?”

“Didn’t you witness it earlier?”

Wan Qianshan fell silent.

Li Xi’s resolve rang true—no bluff. Her shot at Huang Ming, though inaccurate, had been steady.

At this range, exchanging lives was feasible. Wan Qianshan believed her.

Trade his life? He dared not.

Too much blood and sweat had built his empire. Dying by a woman’s hand? Unthinkable.

Yet being held at gunpoint by one, forced to retreat—this humiliation would tarnish his reputation.

His face twisted with conflict.

“Decide quickly. Police will arrive soon,” Li Xi pressed.

“You think I’d believe such a cheap trick?”

“My phone dialed 110. It’s in my pocket. Disbelieve if you wish—the police will complicate matters further.”

Wan Qianshan glanced at her pocket, weighing her words. Gun charges meant serious trouble. Though his influence might keep him from jail, complications abounded. This wasn’t his turf; even he couldn’t brazenly assault officers.

Defeated—by a woman.

“Go,” he growled, face burning as if slapped.

In youth, he’d sacrificed face and safety to become the underworld kingpin. Now middle-aged, guarding both status and life, his empire plateaued.

“Escort us to the exit.” Even with his compliance, Li Xi trusted no gangster’s honor. She demanded absolute security.

“You doubt me?” Wan Qianshan’s voice chilled.

“I trust results. Remember—we’re wasting *your* time.”

His expression darkened. Today, Li Xi had outmaneuvered him completely.

Reluctantly, he moved to the door, Guan Yu covering their rear against the three bodyguards.

At the doorway, Li Xi ordered, “Face away from the exit. Move only once we’re at a safe distance. Any defiance, and this gun might misfire. My aim’s poor, but his”—she nodded at Guan Yu—“isn’t.”

Wan Qianshan’s rage threatened to burst his lungs.

As Li Xi and Guan Yu exited, Wan Qianshan blocked the doorway, blind to their retreat. His men stood paralyzed, unwilling to risk their boss’s life.

**Chapter 533: The Bluff**

While the four hesitated, Guan Yu—leg still bleeding—fled the hotel with Li Xi.

Though bystanders stared in shock, none intervened, sparing them further trouble.

Inside Li Xi’s car, Guan Yu collapsed into the seat, blood soaking the upholstery. The wound pulsed relentlessly—a severed vessel. His pallor worsened.

Only now, safe, did he activate the healing system, slowly channeling energy to staunch the flow.

“Don’t go to the hospital,” he insisted while treating himself.

“Your leg’s still bleeding,” Li Xi replied, eyes on the road.

“It’s a gunshot wound. Doctors would report it, bring police. Trouble.”

To persuade her, he added, “I can stop it myself. Look.”

Li Xi glanced briefly. The bloodied mess offered no clarity as she drove.

“Since when do you fear police?” she countered, aware of his connections with N City’s police chief.

Growing desperate, Guan Yu said, “It’s truly stopped. I’ll strip if you need proof.”

With current energy levels, halting the bleed was manageable, though exhaustion gripped him.

He feared not police questioning, but hospital procedures—stitches, recovery, then reopening wounds at home to erase scars. With his healing system, full recovery sans marks required only energy, abundantly available at his villa.

“Where to?” Li Xi relented, preferring bloodstained seats to witnessing his gruesome injury.

“My villa.” Relief colored his voice. At this hour, home stood empty—no witnesses to his condition.

“Direct me.”

Arriving, Li Xi waited on the sofa while Guan Yu tended his wound in the bathroom.

An hour later, he emerged—stride confident, no trace of injury.

Two intensive healing sessions, fueled by recharges, had restored him completely.

Observing his vigor, Li Xi arched a brow. The man who’d neared death now moved like nothing happened. Had she not seen his wound, she’d suspect a ploy for sympathy.

“Told you I could handle it,” Guan Yu boasted.

Li Xi nodded slightly.

“Aren’t you curious how I healed so fast?” he prodded.

“You’ll speak if willing.”

Grinning, he tapped his temple. “Supreme medical skills.”

*Idiot.*

Retrieving wine, Guan Yu poured them each a glass—his filled to the brim. Clinking her cup, he toasted, “Thanks.”

He drained his in one gulp. “Feels good to be alive.”

Li Xi sipped politely.

“You’ve handled guns before?” he finally asked, eyeing her flawless hands.

“No. First time.”

“First time?!” He gaped. “How’d you shoot so well?”

“I acted. No reason needed.”

Staring as if she were an alien, Guan Yu muttered, “No tremor, shooting at a person… You’re wasted not being a marksman.” His gaze dropped to her slender fingers. “Though… guns ruin a lady’s image.”

Li Xi noted his glance but stayed silent.

“Will the police catch them red-handed?” he asked, marveling at today’s role reversal—not hero saving beauty, but beauty saving hero.

“I never called them. It was a bluff.”

“A bluff?!” His eyes bulged. “You fooled even me!”

Li Xi redefined his understanding of perfection—wisdom and courage personified.

“Why bluff them then?”

“No reason. I chose to.” She sipped wine.

He doubted this. The urgency in her lie suggested deeper motive—likely concern for his bleeding.

Understanding dawned: she’d rushed Wan Qianshan to save Guan Yu’s life.

Moved, he reflected: he’d dragged her into danger; she’d pulled him out.

**Chapter 534: This One Must Not Live**

Guan Yu’s gaze burned into Li Xi, who sat unperturbed.
