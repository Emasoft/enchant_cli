“Exactly,” Wang Xiaorong chimed in with a laugh. “This kid kept shouting that his three big brothers were coming to slaughter everyone here. Clearly, three beggars showed up.”

Guan Yu shook his head and whispered, “Not beggars. Though dressed in rags, they’re definitely not destitute. They resemble mountain stronghold folk, but such characters aren’t uncommon in the jianghu.”

“Uncommon they may be, but they’re certainly rare.”

The towering man on the left sat with limbs like withered branches—an adult’s arm appeared thicker than his legs. His elongated face bore an uncanny resemblance to the child’s, particularly the abnormally long chin that stretched comically downward. A horizontal scar marred this chin, its placement lending absurdity rather than menace. Vertical or diagonal scars might have conveyed ferocity, but this transverse gash looked positively foolish.

The middle man seemed ordinary in build and stature, save for dull eyes and peculiar features—thick body hair, swarthy skin, and striking unibrow as dark as ink. His counterpart on the right defied proportion: a rotund dwarf barely five feet tall yet weighing over two hundred pounds. This human barrel stood neckless, his jowls spilling onto shoulders, eyes reduced to porcine slits that first appeared closed.

Closer inspection revealed their attire—crudely stitched animal pelts replacing proper clothing. Though giving vagrant impressions from grime-darkened skin, their bulging money pouches and opulent accessories betrayed wealth. The fattest wore a sleek black pelt cloak and sported a fist-sized octagonal jade pendant.

“That’s the Red Lotus Sect’s Jade Bagua!” Guan Yu hissed, pointing at the pendant.

Wang leaned forward. “The color-shifting heirloom? How’d these ruffians obtain it? They can’t be Red Lotus disciples.”

“Impossible,” Guan Yu asserted. “Sect Leader Sun Lianzi would never entrust this treasure to such rabble. More likely stolen or seized through conflict.”

The fatty’s golden broadsword glittered with gemstones, its hilt and scabbard dripping opulence. His gilded belt strained under ostentatious displays—a parvenu flaunting entire fortune. The lanky leftmost man wore a thumb-thick earring stretching his lobe perilously, while the middle brute hefted a wrist-thick iron staff.

Chaos erupted as the trio barged in, the skinny one brandishing a broadsword at the tall patron restraining their urchin protege. “Damn your eyes! Dare strike our brother? I’ll skin you alive!”

The escaped urchin cowered behind them, face smeared with pilfered rice he licked greedily—a sight that made Wang Xiaorong shudder in disgust.

“Big brothers! They all bullied me, especially that giant!” the brat whined, omitting his own spitting provocation.

As the iron staff-wielder charged, Guan Yu pulled Wang aside to avoid bloodsplash. The staff shattered tables like kindling, forcing the giant defender to shield his wife in the corner.

When the crushing blow descended, spectators winced... only to gasp as the giant caught the staff barehanded! Cracks echoed through the silent tavern—not from shattered bone, but the staff itself snapping under the giant’s grip!

“Incredible!” Wang gaped as the disarmed attacker staggered back. Yet Guan Yu noted the giant’s crimson, swollen hand—a pyrrhic victory.

Now the remaining two ruffians circled like jackals, golden blades glinting. “Flank him!” the fatty barked. “Front and back!”

The giant pressed against the wall, injured right hand useless. His wife watched helplessly by the stairs as steel closed in.

“Shouldn’t we help?” Wang whispered urgently.

Before Guan Yu could reply, the tavern owner rushed in bellowing: “Cease this madness! Who’ll pay for my wrecked—”

“Shut your trap, old fool!” the skinny one roared. “Interfere and join him in death!”

In the tense standoff, the giant stood resolute—a wounded lion facing hyenas, his fate hanging by a thread.
