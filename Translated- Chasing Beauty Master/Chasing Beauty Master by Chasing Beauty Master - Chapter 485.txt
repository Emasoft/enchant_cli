“Could it be that I still can’t break through to the Nascent Soul stage today?” Guan Yu muttered dejectedly. Suddenly, the formation’s core lit up, and spiritual energy surged anew within the array. Guan Yu felt invigorated as the surrounding energy condensed. Reinvigorated, he resumed circulating his Nine Revolutions Mystic Art, allowing the spiritual energy to nurture his Golden Core. The core spun at full power, gradually cracking like an egg about to hatch. A naked miniature figure resembling Guan Yu emerged, absorbing the scattered golden energy. An ineffable sensation arose in his heart as he felt like he’d suddenly gained another self.

Guiding his consciousness into the Nascent Soul, Guan Yu watched through its lively eyes, marveling at this strange yet familiar body. He waved the tiny hands excitedly and touched the smooth face. “Not bad – looks just as handsome as me!”

As Guan Yu continued experimenting with his Nascent Soul’s movements, the formation unexpectedly brightened further. Before he realized the danger, a flash of light consumed him. “Careless! My life ends here!” Darkness engulfed his vision as consciousness retreated into the Nascent Soul. Simultaneously, a mysterious light escaped the formation and vanished into his body.

Chapter 1228: The Elven Maiden

Time passed indeterminably before Guan Yu groggily awoke to darkness. Attempting to circulate energy, he shuddered – his meridians were severely damaged from spatial tearing during teleportation. Without spiritual energy, even his Nascent Soul lay listless.

“What fresh hell is this?” He struggled to rise against gravity ten times Earth’s norm. The oppressive atmosphere weighed heavier than the physical force. As his eyes adjusted, monstrous tree silhouettes loomed while distant beast cries echoed.

“Must find shelter before this Nascent Soul expert gets eaten by beasts.” Hobbling weakly, he discovered a massive tree cavity. Inside, he masked the entrance and began meditating to repair meridians.

By dawn, slight recovery allowed basic movement. Sunlight revealed an unexpectedly pristine interior – vibrant vines adorned the ceiling, foot trails suggesting occasional visitors. Guan Yu pondered Earth’s fate when crystalline laughter interrupted.

Two stunning figures entered, their fragrance preceding them – one reminiscent of orchids, the other jasmine. Guan Yu hid, observing through a crevice.

The left beauty wore jade-green robes revealing snow-white calves, azure hair cascading around an ethereal face with crystalline green eyes that sparkled like desert springs. Her delicate features and translucent jade skin seemed carved from milk curd.

The right beauty showcased sculpted arms resting on a wasp waist girdled by a crystal-studded belt. Her breathtaking legs, exposed by ultrashort skirts, gleamed beneath crystal sandals revealing perfect toes.

Enthralled, Guan Yu activated Spirit Communion Art to understand their speech.

“Amy, let’s rest here,” said the shorts-clad beauty.
“Yes, Roxie sister,” the green-robed one replied, pointed ears peeking through hair.
“We’ll reach Coreheart Forest tomorrow. I miss Angel’s heartcakes!”

Guan Yu gaped – elves? Where had that damned portal sent him?

“Greedy girl! My pastries aren’t good enough?” Roxie teased.
“No! Roxie’s treats make me drool...” Amy clung to her, voluptuous curves swaying dangerously. Guan Yu’s breath hitched – the portal must have affected him!

“Who’s there?!” Roxie drew a compact bow. Amy conjured a translucent shield while preparing spells.

Emerging casually after cleansing himself, Guan Yu faced their weapons. His white robes billowed around a tall, handsome frame with bewitching dark eyes.

“Halt! Identify yourself!” Roxie demanded, noting his unfamiliar features.
A fireball suddenly flew from Amy. “Shit! Shouldn’t have wasted energy showing off...” Guan Yu collapsed thinking, “At least I die under peonies...”

Chapter 1229: Dragonkin Guan Yu?

“Oops...” Amy stuck out her tongue. Roxie sighed at the unconscious man. “What if he’s friendly? Now we’re stuck babysitting!”
“But he’s so weak!” Amy pouted.

Guan Yu’s consciousness observed from his Nascent Soul as they carried him. Feigning unconsciousness, he enjoyed Roxie’s soft touch while lamenting his disgrace – a Nascent Soul expert felled by a novice’s spell!

Laid on stone, Roxie studied Guan Yu’s chiseled features until Amy interrupted. “Sister’s blushing!”
“Nonsense! He’s foreign – black hair and eyes...”
“But he smells familiar...” Amy concentrated. “Dragonkin!” they realized simultaneously.

Roxie paled – assaulting allied dragonkin meant tribal punishment. Yet why would dragonkin collapse from minor magic? Her cheeks flushed recalling his muscular frame.

“He’s internally injured!” Amy’s healing magic roused Guan Yu.
“Where am I?” he groaned.
“Coreheart Forest’s outskirts. Which dragon clan are you from?” Amy inquired.
“Dragonkin? I’m Chinese – descendant of dragons!” Guan Yu improvised.

“Hua Xia? No such clan in Bluemoon Continent...”
“I’m from Eurasia.”
“So far! Come heal with our elders,” Roxie urged. Guan Yu agreed, mesmerized by her smile.

Introductions followed. Guan Yu lingered shaking Roxie’s hand until she pulled away, branding him a lecherous dragon.

Come nightfall, Amy wove vines into beds using nature magic. “Our basics rival dragon spells!” she boasted.
“32 praises!” Guan Yu quipped, confusing them.

Chapter 1230: Beast Control Art

Conversation flowed until dark. Amy wove a vine door boasting, “My growth spell detects intruders!”
“Enough showing off,” Roxie chided. “Still, stay alert – even low-tier beasts prowl here.”

Guan Yu meditated until sensing approaching malice. Waking the elves, he whispered, “Trouble nears.”

Outside, glowing eyes pierced the dark. Something vicious approached...
