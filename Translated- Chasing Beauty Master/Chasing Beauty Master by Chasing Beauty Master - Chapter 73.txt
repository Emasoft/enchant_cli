Guan Yu also called Luo Cheng. Although Aunt Luo hadn’t fully recovered yet...there seemed little necessity for her to remain hospitalized. As long as he periodically treated Aunt Luo to maintain her current condition, she could live and study normally without any hindrance.

Upon hearing Guan Yu’s suggestion, Luo Cheng readily agreed. He brought Niu Le and Du Xiaojuan to the hospital to handle discharge procedures.

Poor Director Liu, who had been gleefully brewing premium Longjing tea in his office while awaiting Guan Yu’s arrival. He had been mentally rehearsing how to persuade Guan Yu to treat the granddaughter of an esteemed elder.

After anxiously waiting for over an hour, the restless director rushed to Feng Xin’s ward only to freeze in shock.

“Who authorized this discharge? How dare you handle such an important matter without reporting to me!” The furious Director Liu berated the attending physicians, who stood before him with bowed heads like scolded schoolchildren.

The director’s outburst was utterly unreasonable! Countless patients had been discharged before without requiring his approval—why should this case be different?

His bright path to career advancement now darkened. He had boldly assured the elder that Guan Yu’s therapeutic qigong could significantly improve his granddaughter’s condition. The anxious elder had even authorized unlimited compensation for Guan Yu’s services.

Director Liu understood this granddaughter’s chronic illness had long tormented the elderly leader, whose sole remaining relative she was. Naturally, the elder was desperate.

But now...he had botched everything...

“Find Feng Xin and Luo Sufen’s contact information immediately! Use every resource to locate Guan Yu!” Director Liu resolved fiercely.

While arranging staff to search for Guan Yu’s contacts, he simultaneously called colleagues at Jingdu Military Hospital to explain the situation...

Unaware of Director Liu’s turmoil, Guan Yu saw Feng Xin off before accompanying Luo Cheng’s group to escort Aunt Luo home.

Entering Aunt Luo’s residence felt like stepping into a kindergarten—dozens of small chairs filled the floor as seven or eight shabbily dressed children swarmed around Aunt Luo with affectionate greetings.

Beaming, Aunt Luo greeted each child individually. Witnessing this heartwarming scene filled Guan Yu with tender emotion.

Though life was hard, this loving extended family radiated joy and contentment.

Happiness didn’t require material wealth, Guan Yu realized more profoundly in this moment.

Through meager earnings, Aunt Luo had raised Luo Cheng’s generation. Now she cared for seven more adopted children—supported by Luo Cheng and his brothers’ incomes.

After embracing the children, Aunt Luo apologetically gestured for Guan Yu’s group to sit on the sofa, serving tea with warm hospitality.

Seeing the skinny, dark-skinned children’s longing eyes, Guan Yu felt an unexpected surge of emotion. A sudden idea flooded his mind.

While he couldn’t personally care for these abandoned children, his nearly ten-million-yuan fortune—earned through his abilities—could support them. Beyond securing his own needs, this money currently sat idle in banks. Witnessing their plight crystallized his resolve.

“Aunt Luo...from now on, I’ll cover all these children’s living and educational expenses. As long as I can earn money, I’ll support them. This promise stands forever.” Guan Yu’s calm declaration stunned Aunt Luo.

“Child...what did you say?” she stammered.

“You might not know, but Luo Cheng understands—money isn’t an issue for me. After your years of hardship raising them, I’ll fully shoulder these children’s future.”

“Share your bank account later. I’ll transfer one million yuan immediately for their needs.”

“That’s too much!” Aunt Luo protested anxiously, waving her hands.

Guan Yu understood the shock of sudden wealth for someone lifelong impoverished—he remembered his own elation at first winning two thousand yuan in lottery.

“This is decided. Rest assured, I’ll continue as long as I can earn.”

Too many wealthy people acted cruelly. While he couldn’t personally care for snot-nosed kids, he could fund this cause. This was charity he could trust—Aunt Luo’s integrity ensured the money wouldn’t be misused.

Hearing Guan Yu’s vow, Aunt Luo trembled as she gathered Luo Cheng and his sworn brothers. With tearful eyes, she declared: “I raised these boys from nothing. Though life was hard, meeting you is their great fortune. From now on, I entrust them to you. Luo Cheng, Little Er—follow Guan Yu faithfully and don’t cause trouble.”

PS: Addressing everyone—all issues resolved! Resuming updates with minimum three chapters daily. After New Year, five chapters daily! My deepest apologies for unstable updates recently. I solemnly promise to strive for five chapters daily, minimum three. A formal bow of apology to all brothers!

Chapter 177: Expanding Influence

Though a simple woman, Aunt Luo recognized Guan Yu’s extraordinary nature and limitless potential. Entrusting her boys to such a remarkable person gave her complete peace of mind.

Luo Cheng nodded solemnly. “Brother Yu, we’ll follow you from now on. Please guide us.”

“Don’t say that!” Guan Yu waved awkwardly...

After Aunt Luo privately spoke with Guan Yu, she reiterated instructions for her boys to behave. She knew they’d been drifting through life—without education or connections, they could only perform manual labor. Following Guan Yu might change their destinies.

Riding motorcycles, Guan Yu’s new entourage roared toward a renowned city hotel for celebration.

Twenty-strong, the Flying Wheels Gang comprised Aunt Luo’s six foster sons and other street youths from poor backgrounds. Though rough-mannered, they仅限于街头混混-level mischief.

When all assembled, Luo Cheng stood solemnly with raised glass: “Brother Yu, after this toast, you’re our leader. Whatever you need, we’ll brave fire and flood without hesitation!”

The scene resembled ancient sworn brotherhood rituals, amusing Guan Yu.

Earlier, Luo Cheng had introduced Guan Yu as their new leader. Accepting this role, Guan Yu rose boldly: “We’re brothers united by fate. Let’s create better lives together! Why should we remain at society’s bottom? Others enjoy luxuries—with unity, we can too!”

“This needs gradual effort. Frankly, I never sought leadership. But since you’ve chosen me, I’ll temporarily lead. However, if someone more capable emerges, I’ll gladly step down!”

“Never! We follow you!” they chorused.

Guan Yu smiled, heart surging. He now had loyal brothers—remembering how Liu Lao-da’s gang had rescued him and Feng Xin, he acutely understood the value of reliable forces.

This accidental inheritance of twenty followers was just the beginning.

The immediate issue was their rootless existence—working as hired thugs and collecting protection fees along Qinhuai River’s commercial streets wasn’t sustainable.

“Let’s discuss over drinks!” Guan Yu urged.

As the feast progressed, Niu Le bonded with the gang, his straightforward nature winning their affection.

“We need legitimate business,” Guan Yu proposed. “Being enforcers offers no future.”

“But what can we do? We’ve no capital...”

“I have funds,” Guan Yu stated firmly.

Luo Cheng leaned forward eagerly. “Brother Yu, what’s your plan?”

“I’m unfamiliar with local turf wars, but you control several commercial streets? Let’s start there. I’ll invest millions. Though it could sustain us for years, do you want mere survival? Or real success?”

“I’ll provide capital—development depends on you. This isn’t my expertise.” Guan Yu delegated to Luo Cheng.

He couldn’t manage daily operations—securing their loyalty sufficed. His wealth-generation abilities could expand funds endlessly. But safety required powerful backing—without which, even billions invited danger.

Thus, building influence became imperative...

Chapter 178: Survival Code

Guan Yu had no concrete development plans. Beyond needing loyal allies, his supernatural abilities made earning money effortless. Yet wealth alone couldn’t rival established families’ political and commercial networks.

To survive, expansion was essential—this world’s law of jungle never changed. Complacent people only recognized its cruelty when crisis struck.

Guan Yu remembered neighborhood demolition disputes—families losing homes without compensation after decade-long battles. Petitioners got arrested while neighbors watched indifferently.

Those with connections navigated such issues smoothly. Money, connections, power—these comprised society’s survival code.

Though lacking these currently, Guan Yu’s extraordinary gifts promised eventual ascension. Building from ground up required loyal brothers. Funding them while securing their allegiance sufficed.

Though calculating, these were practical realities. Moreover, Guan Yu genuinely liked these youths.

After the feast, Guan Yu returned to his hotel with Niu Le—sharing a room with Du Xiaojuan as usual.

Another chaste night passed. Come morning, Du Xiaojuan’s blissful gaze upon waking made his restraint worthwhile.

Persuading the sleepy girl to rise, Guan Yu sighed at her curvaceous silhouette in cartoon bear pajamas...
