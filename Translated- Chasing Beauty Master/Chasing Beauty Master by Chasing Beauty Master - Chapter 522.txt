Wei Buqun was no ordinary opponent. As the purple flames were about to engulf him, he suddenly turned and blocked with his Profound Black Sword.

*Clang! Clang!*

After two resounding strikes, Wei Buqun lashed out toward Guan Yu's direction. Instantly, another towering tree was cleaved in half!

Yet Guan Yu was not behind the tree. Having failed his ambush, Guan Yu had anticipated Wei Buqun's counterattack and evaded beforehand.

“Sect Leader, his aura is beginning to wane!”

Just as Guan Yu considered fleeing, Jin Gang’s voice reached him.

“Oh? What do you suggest?”

“If you hold out for ten more minutes, the advantage will shift to you. Then we can finish this madman!”

Guan Yu pondered briefly before nodding. Leaving such a threat alive would only invite future calamity. Better to end it decisively now.

“Very well! This grandfather will indulge you for ten more minutes. Let’s hope you don’t disappoint!”

With that, Guan Yu leaped from behind cover and pointed at Wei Buqun, taunting, “Madman! Your grandfather’s right here! No need to search!”

“Hmph! I knew you hadn’t gone far. Since we’re alone, I’ll grant you a secret before your death.”

“A secret? You mean the collusion between your Blackwater Mercenary Group and Locke’s faction?”

Wei Buqun’s face paled, but he soon sneered again. “Heh, you’re sharper than I thought. In decades of roaming the jianghu, you’re the most troublesome foe I’ve encountered!”

“Is that so? Then your decades were wasted, wallowing in the dregs of the martial world, never encountering true masters. Pathetic!”

“Brat! When I catch you, I’ll stitch your mouth shut! Your prattling gives me a headache!”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Flattery! Who knew my voice had such wondrous effects? If it pains you, I’ll speak more! Suffer, you shriveled old dwarf!”

“Enough! Taste my blade!” Wei Buqun thrust his Demonic Profound Black Sword forward, but halfway through the strike, the crimson glow on the blade faded, reverting it to an ordinary sword.

**Chapter 1321: Slaying Wei Buqun**

“What’s happening?!” Wei Buqun finally sensed the shift in his combat strength.

“Need you ask? Relying on Golden Saint Pills to boost power is unsustainable. It erodes your true strength. Now, you’re no match for me.”

Wei Buqun didn’t argue. His face contorted as he fumbled for his spatial ring, desperate to swallow another pill.

Guan Yu struck immediately. *Boom!* A crater erupted beneath Wei Buqun’s feet, but the man still managed to gulp the pill mid-air.

“Damned bastard! How many do you have?!”

Guan Yu cursed. If Wei Buqun’s power surged again, escape would be his only option.

Yet, contrary to expectations, the second pill weakened Wei Buqun further. Guan Yu sighed in relief. *Seems these pills are worthless. That second dose was wasted—ten thousand gold coins down the drain!*

Had Wei Buqun known Guan Yu’s regret stemmed from monetary loss, he’d have spat blood in fury.

“Brat! Never underestimate a Sword King! Even in death, I’ll drag you with me!”

Wei Buqun lunged recklessly. Without the pill’s enhancement, Guan Yu faced no fear. His current strength rivaled a Sword King’s, let alone an injured one.

“Perish!”

Guan Yu flicked his wrist, unleashing twin purple flames that struck Wei Buqun’s head and chest. *Thud! Thud!* Two new holes tore through the man’s tattered robes.

“Curse you!”

Wei Buqun turned to flee, but Guan Yu anticipated this. Before he cleared twenty meters, another blast shattered his skull.

*Bang!*

Brains splattered as the corpse collapsed. Guan Yu approached, stomach churning with nausea. “Filthy wretch! Even dead, you disgust me!”

After a brief rest, Guan Yu sprinted toward the Forest of Spirits.

Once he departed, a figure emerged by the corpse, weeping. “Leader… I’ll avenge you!”

This was Shan Hu, one of Blackwater’s Six Tigers. He’d feigned death during the clash with Shi Tuo and witnessed Guan Yu’s lethal strike.

“For now, I’ll seek refuge with the Black Dragon Mercenary Group. Guan Yu… you’ll pay!”

**Chapter 1322: Unmasking the Plot**

Upon returning to the Forest of Spirits, Guan Yu found a crowd led by Amy and Shi Tuo at the mountain pass.

“Hurry! Lives are at stake! Move with urgency!”

Amy’s authoritative tone amused Guan Yu. “Little Amy, where are you herding everyone?”

“Big Brother Longzu! It’s really you!”

Though barely half a day had passed, Amy rushed to him as if reunited after centuries.

“Who else would it be? A ghost?”

Shi Tuo approached, impressed by Guan Yu’s unscathed state. “You’ve got skill. What happened?”

“Wei Buqun is dead.” The casual statement left Shi Tuo speechless.

“Too many ears here. We’ll discuss details later.”

Nodding, Shi Tuo led them to the council hall.

Inside, Elder Kael gaped in shock. “Brother Guan Yu! We heard you were pursued. I sent aid, but you returned before they departed!”

“Apologies for the concern, Chief Allen. A minor nuisance, nothing more.”

Allen’s expression tightened. Earlier, Kael had painted the situation as dire, yet Guan Yu dismissed it lightly.

“Minor? Look how worried Elder Kael and Amy were! What exactly happened?”

Guan Yu glanced around. “Is this the place?”

“Speak freely. All here are trusted.”

Noting Locke’s absence, Guan Yu mused, *He’s likely inspecting Wei Buqun’s corpse.*

“Father, let Brother Longzu rest! He’s endured so much today!” Amy interjected.

Shi Tuo chuckled. “The lad himself hasn’t complained. Why fuss, little one?”

“I’m not fussing!”

Allen pressed, “Guan Yu, what transpired?”

Sighing, Guan Yu shot a meaningful look at Kael. “I eliminated my pursuer.”

“You… truly killed him?!” Kael stammered.

Guan Yu shrugged. “Verify it yourself if you doubt.”

“Why… why would I?”

“Shi Tuo, who was this pursuer? Why target you?”

Shi Tuo pondered. “Unclear motives. Perhaps past grudges. But I’m certain—he was at least a Sword King!”

Silence gripped the hall. Slaying a Sword King? Unthinkable!

**Chapter 1323: Neutralizing the Poison**

Allen stared at Guan Yu. “Is this true?”

Guan Yu didn’t deny it. Let them marvel—Wei Buqun on pills had rivaled a Sword Emperor.

“Enough. Guan Yu needs rest. Council adjourned.”

As others dispersed, Allen, Shi Tuo, Amy, and Guan Yu retreated to a private chamber.

“Brother Shi Tuo!” Allen clasped his old friend’s shoulders.

“Allen! Years of estrangement… yet in my heart, you remain my closest brother!”

“As do you! Let the past rest!”

Their tearful reunion moved Guan Yu. *True camaraderie—time and distance meaningless.*

“But to business. You know why I summoned you?”

Shi Tuo nodded. “The World Tree’s sudden ailment. Sabotage?”

Allen sighed. “Guan Yu claims it’s poisoned. Let us verify.”

En route to the Sacred Isle, Allen pressed, “Guan Yu, how did you slay a Sword King?”

“When Amy, Roxi, and I first met, we rescued Kali from Blackwater’s men. I killed their captain—a Blackwater commander.”

“But their leaders are Grandmaster Swordsmen. How did a Sword King emerge?”

“The Six Tigers were all Grandmasters. We eliminated them.”

“Six Grandmasters?!” Allen gaped. “Even I’d struggle against such force!”

Amy added, “But the worst was their leader—a dwarf!”

“Wei Buqun? Their chief? How could you defeat him?!”

Shi Tuo interjected, “Guan Yu’s a prodigy. Sense his aura yourself.”

Allen gripped Guan Yu’s hand, channeling energy. Sparks flew as he gasped, “Archmage-level power! Yet you’ve grown so swiftly!”

“But an Archmage shouldn’t best a Sword King!”

Amy huffed, “Father! He did! Elder Kael watched idly—acting suspicious!”

“Kael was present?!” Allen stiffened. “What secret is he hiding?”

Guan Yu’s gaze hardened. The web of conspiracy was unraveling.
