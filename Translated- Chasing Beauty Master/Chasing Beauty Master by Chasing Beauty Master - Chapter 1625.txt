He smiled and said, “Child, it’s not right for you to do this. These coins belong to this elder. You shouldn’t touch them without permission.”

The child, realizing he’d been caught, immediately resorted to his signature tactic—bursting into loud, dramatic tears. A middle-aged woman with a portly frame waddled over and bellowed, “How dare you bully my Erbao? Everyone, look at this! A grown man picking on a child! Shame on you!”

Guan Yu frowned, pried the child’s hand open, and said, “Be a good boy and return these coins to the elder. Correcting your mistake shows maturity.”

“No!” the child wailed, his crocodile tears unconvincing. “Mom told me to pick up coins from the ground! Said I could buy buns with ’em! What I find is mine!”

“Then you’re not a good boy after all,” Guan Yu said coldly. The child’s wails intensified. The woman shoved Guan Yu, hugged her son, and jabbed a finger at him. “What’s your scheme with my Erbao? Everyone’s watching! A villain like you ought to be dragged to the magistrate!”

The crowd remained silent. All had seen the dirt-smudged coins in the child’s hand, clearly scavenged from the ground. Though aware of the duo’s charade, none dared speak up.

The elderly performer approached and patted Guan Yu’s shoulder. “Sir, I appreciate your kindness. Let the child keep the coins for buns. Don’t trouble yourself further.”

Guan Yu stood, observing the man’s deeply lined face. “Since you’re so generous, I’ll say no more.”

The old man recognized the woman and child’s practiced act of feigned helplessness. Resigned, he turned to leave when he spotted two silver fragments ahead—discarded earlier by Wang Xiaorong. As he crouched to collect them, a boot suddenly stamped on one piece.

Guan Yu’s eyes narrowed. Trouble had arrived. A wealthy young lord stood smugly over the silver. The elder looked up pleadingly, “Young master, please lift your foot. That silver is mine. I apologize for inconveniencing you.”

**Chapter 4222: Resolving the Crisis (Part 2)**

The elder knew better than to provoke nobility, yet the silver’s importance compelled him. The lord smirked down. “Want silver? I’ve plenty. Bring that girl to perform at my estate, and this ingot’s yours.”

The elder paled. “My granddaughter cannot go. My ailing wife needs care. We’ve no time for performances today.”

“I’ll send servants to tend your wife,” the lord countered. “Or stay with her yourself—just send the girl. This silver will cover her treatment.” A lackey added, “Obey, and you’ll never need to street-perform again.”

The crowd murmured. Some saw opportunity for the girl; others foresaw ruin. All recognized the lord—Zhang, the tyrannical son of Bajia City’s governor, whose family backed the Second Prince.

“She’s too young,” the elder insisted. “We’re mere travelers earning passage. Please let us be.”

The lord’s smile vanished. “Old fool! I’m offering fortune! Must your granddaughter toil in sun and wind?”

The granddaughter emerged, belongings packed. “Grandfather, rise.” Helping him up, she addressed the lord coolly, “Your offer is declined. Keep the silver—consider it payment for cleaning your boot.”

As they turned to leave, the lord snarled, “Seize them!” Five lackeys surged forward.

Guan Yu moved like wind—tripping one, striking another. Within moments, all five lay groaning. “Touch them,” he declared, “and not even your governor father will save you.”

Wang Xiaorong watched adoringly, thrilled by Guan Yu’s righteous valor.

The lord brandished a fan. “You dare strike my men? I’ll have you skinned al—”

*CRACK!* Guan Yu’s slap echoed through the square. A knee to the gut sent the lord sprawling. “Filthy tongue. Did your parents teach you only curses?”

“Y-you’ll pay!” the lord whimpered, crawling away. “Bring every guard! Kill this bastard!”

Guan Yu retrieved the trampled silver. “Take this and flee the city. You’re not safe here.”

**Chapter 4223: No Time Left**

The elder accepted the silver gratefully. “Noble sir, you’ve made enemies of Governor Zhang—the Second Prince’s favorite! What will you do?”

Guan Yu stiffened. Governor Zhang’s allegiance explained much. If the governor served the Second Prince, Magistrate Zou’s stay at his estate was perilous.

“You’re certain of the governor’s ties to the Second Prince?”

“All Bajia knows it,” the elder confirmed. “Flee now before they return!”

Guan Yu smiled. “The Second Prince himself couldn’t touch me. I must return to the governor’s mansion.”

The elder gaped. “Are you courting death?”

“I’ve allies there. Warn them.”

As the elder hesitated, Wang Xiaorong approached the blushing granddaughter. “Dear, have you a betrothed? My friend needs a clever, kind wife...”

Guan Yu sighed. “Xiaorong, stop teasing. They must leave.”

The granddaughter presented Guan Yu a intricate red paper flower. “Our humble thanks.”

Wang Xiaorong persisted. “I’m serious! My friend Hongren needs—”

“Are you two jesting?” the girl interrupted, bewildered.

Guan Yu explained awkwardly, “We’re... disguised. My friend seeks a bride after heartbreak. Xiaorong means well.”

**Chapter 4224: Clarifications**

The granddaughter eyed them suspiciously. “One urges flight, the other matchmaking. Which is true?”

Guan Yu grimaced. “My fiancée”—Wang Xiaorong beamed—“promised our friend a worthy bride. Your grace caught her eye.”

“This is no time for matchmaking!” the girl exclaimed.

Wang Xiaorong pouted. “But Hongren’s perfect! Brave, loyal—”

“Enough,” Guan Yu cut in. “Go swiftly. The governor’s men approach.”

As the pair hurried away, Wang Xiaorong huffed. “You ruined my matchmaking!”

Guan Yu gazed toward the governor’s mansion. “Priorities. Magistrate Zou’s in the lion’s den.”

The elder’s final warning echoed: *“Leave before it’s too late.”* But for Guan Yu, the true danger lay where others thought themselves safest.
