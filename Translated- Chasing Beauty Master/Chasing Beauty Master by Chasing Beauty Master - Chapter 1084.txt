“Hmph, so what if I’m driving? At worst, we’ll all die together!” Lü Mei roared, her temper flaring as she shook the steering wheel even more violently.

The car’s path grew increasingly erratic. Guan Yu urgently pleaded, “Xue Jing, hurry and help! Stop her! I’m driving here—this isn’t a joke!”

Finally, with no other choice, Guan Yu slammed on the brakes, bringing the car to a sudden halt. Thankfully, no accident occurred. Once stopped, Lü Mei grew even more unrestrained, vigorously shaking Guan Yu’s head as if he were a ragdoll, his body swaying wildly inside the cramped cabin.

“My ancestors, please stop shaking me!” Guan Yu begged. “If you keep this up, I’ll vomit!”

“Hmph! Serves you right for insulting my mother! I’ll shake you until you puke—shake you to death!” Lü Mei’s inexplicable strength left Guan Yu dizzy and disoriented.

As Guan Yu was jostled, the car itself rocked visibly from the outside. Parked sideways in the middle of the road, the vehicle’s conspicuous position and rhythmic swaying drew countless curious stares.

Many onlookers stifled laughter. “Car rocking in broad daylight, right in the middle of the road? How brazen!”

Drivers pulled over to film the spectacle with their phones, anticipating viral online fame. Soon, a crowd encircled the car. Xue Jing slumped low in her seat, grateful for the car’s heavily tinted windows. If not for the privacy, she’d have buried her face in shame.

Whether due to Guan Yu’s pleading or exhaustion, Lü Mei finally relented. Guan Yu slumped groggily. “Look at this crowd you’ve drawn. We’re the laughingstock of the city now.”

“Hmph! I don’t care! You brought this on yourself with your vile tongue!” Lü Mei retorted, panting as she sat back, hands on her hips.

Guan Yu shot Xue Jing an accusing glare. “Why didn’t you stop her? You know how much influence you have among them!” Had Xue Jing intervened earlier, this public spectacle could’ve been avoided.

Xue Jing glanced at him coolly, thinking, *Serves you right. After what you said, you’re lucky she didn’t shake you to death!* Though aware of the danger, she secretly approved of Lü Mei’s retaliation.

Guan Yu massaged his temples, restarting the engine to escape before traffic police arrived. But the car’s sideways position and surrounding crowd made maneuvering impossible. Honking proved futile—the gawkers only pointed and gossiped louder.

Unable to proceed, Guan Yu weighed the risks: hitting someone would invite lawsuits, yet staying invited fines and tedious police questioning. Gritting his teeth, he inched forward, forcing pedestrians to grudgingly part.

Just as the car straightened, an elderly woman collapsed dramatically against the front bumper.

“Unbelievable,” Guan Yu muttered to Xue Jing. “A professional crash-for-cash scam artist. Right on cue.”

Though tempted to “accidentally” run her over—his insurance could cover it—the filming crowd made that impossible.

Xue Jing sighed. “Let’s check on her. If she’s unharmed, we’ll pay her off.”

The “victim” demanded ¥20,000, threatening a ¥50,000 hospital checkup otherwise. Guan Yu knew the drill: hospitals colluded with such scammers, inflating costs for kickbacks.

Dialing Yang Conghan, Guan Yu explained, “I need traffic police assistance. A minor scare, but the crowd’s getting restless.”

As Yang arranged help, Xue Jing returned from assessing the situation. “They’re now gossiping about our earlier ‘car rocking’ instead of the accident.”

Lü Mei turned crimson. “How humiliating! They didn’t even see anything!”

“You’re only realizing this now?” Guan Yu snapped. “Thanks to you, we’re trending as roadside entertainment!”

Lü Mei yanked his ear. “This is YOUR fault! If you hadn’t provoked me—”

“Enough!” Xue Jing’s sharp tone silenced them. The pair’s constant bickering—a hallmark of their relationship since school days—exhausted everyone.

**Chapter 2774: Higher Risks Abroad**

While awaiting police, they discussed the scam industry’s globalization. “Some take this overseas,” Xue Jing noted. “Targeting narrow streets in dense countries. But foreign drivers are less tolerant—one misjudged fall could get them killed.”

The elderly “victim” groaned theatrically as the crowd swelled. Guan Yu eyed his dashcam footage—the woman’s Oscar-worthy flinch would fool any insurer. Professional scammers, he mused, were becoming an international plague.
