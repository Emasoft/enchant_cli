Standing at the school gate, Guanyu received frequent nods and greetings of "Boss" from passing students. Shuangshuang watched curiously, thinking to herself, *If so many people call Big Brother "Boss," does that mean he's... not a good person?*

In her mind, those called "Boss" usually meant trouble. Yet this fleeting thought vanished as quickly as it came. *If Big Brother weren't good,* she reasoned, *there'd be no good people left in this world. He's the kindest soul I've ever met.*

Pan Xiaoxia, observing Guanyu's conspicuous popularity, suggested, "Let's go inside. I'll show you the dormitories."

"Good," Guanyu agreed. "We should check if Shuangshuang needs anything else." Though he'd already purchased all necessities and daily supplies, he wanted thoroughness.

Another student greeted "Good morning, Boss." Pan Xiaoxia chuckled, "How impressive, Guanyu. Everyone calls you Boss—quite the威风八面 (imposing presence)."

Seizing the moment, Shuangshuang asked, "Big Brother, why do they call you Boss? What kind of leader are you?"

Guanyu hesitated. Though mischievous, Shuangshuang possessed childlike innocence he wished to preserve. "I used to study here," he deflected. "They call me Boss out of respect. My martial arts skills earned their admiration—none could defeat me."

"Oh!" Shuangshuang clapped delightedly. "So you're invincible! No wonder!"

**Chapter 2795: An Unconventional Dormitory**

Changing the subject, Guanyu asked Pan Xiaoxia, "You arranged Shuangshuang's class placement, right?" He'd specifically requested his "sister" be under her supervision.

"I stopped being homeroom teacher ages ago," Pan Xiaoxia replied. "Didn't you know? Oh right—you've been absent. Managing a class exhausted me. Should I resume duties just for your adorable sister?"

Guanyu stopped walking. "You're not overseeing her class? Where's she placed then?"

"Relax," Pan Xiaoxia assured. "I assigned her to Teacher Li's class—the school's top academic cohort. Many vie for those spots."

"Which Teacher Li?" Guanyu pressed, needing details about this educator's reputation.

"My longtime friend—impeccable character. Her class is the crown jewel of Kaihuang High."

Nodding, Guanyu decided to investigate Teacher Li privately later. For now, settling Shuangshuang took priority.

**Dormitory Regulations**

At the girls' dormitory entrance, an auntie guarded access. During term starts, male visitors were strictly forbidden—a rule enforced by fingerprint scanners and sign-in logs. However, new students hadn't registered fingerprints yet, permitting temporary entry with signatures.

The matron, a stout woman in her forties, eyed Guanyu skeptically until Shuangshuang's polite "Good day, Auntie Wu!" melted her reservations. Pan Xiaoxia's presence sealed approval.

**Tiers of Accommodation**

The five-story dormitory revealed stark hierarchies:

1st floor: Eight students per room with metal bunk beds.
2nd floor: Four wooden beds per room.
3rd floor: Spacious doubles with improved amenities.
4th floor: Compact singles at moderate prices.
5th floor: Lavish suites rivaling hotel rooms—complete with king beds and premium decor.

Guanyu had secured a fifth-floor suite. As they ascended, Shuangshuang's eyes widened at each level's escalating luxury. By the carpeted fifth floor with its wallpaper and art pieces, she gasped, "This... this is a dormitory?!"

"Welcome to Kaihuang's elite housing," Pan Xiaoxia smiled, opening Room 505. The opulent space featured a ensuite bathroom and plush furnishings.

Shuangshuang stood thunderstruck. "Big Brother... this must cost..."

"Sixty thousand per term," Pan Xiaoxia blurted, immediately regretting it when Shuangshuang protested, "I'll stay on first floor! This is too extravagant!"

"Absolutely not!" Guanyu countered. "You need proper rest for studies. I won't have you in crowded quarters."

Xue Jing pulled Shuangshuang aside. "This concerns Guanyu's reputation. If his 'sister' stays in common dorms, people will question his care for you."

Pan Xiaoxia added tactfully, "These suites are highly coveted. Your brother secured this through connections—others can't obtain it despite wealth."

When Shuangshuang remained hesitant, Guanyu played his trump card: "Should I inform your mother you're being difficult?"

"You wouldn't!" Shuangshuang exclaimed, then sighed. "Alright, I'll stay. But promise no more splurging!"

Guanyu grinned victoriously. "Good girl. Remember—any misbehavior reaches your mother instantly."

As they finalized arrangements, Shuangshuang murmured, "The pressure... What if I embarrass you?"

Guanyu tousled her hair affectionately. "My face is thick-skinned enough. Just be yourself."
