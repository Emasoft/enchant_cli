Wang Xiaorong glanced at the Demon Lord, then at Guan Yu. Deeming the situation safe, she rose and declared, "Very well. This young lady shall fetch wine and dishes for you two men today."

After Wang Xiaorong's departure, the Demon Lord inquired, "Guan Yu, if I forbade your relationship with Xiaorong, how would you respond? Moreover, I demand to know—does your closeness to her conceal ulterior motives toward my Demon Soul Sect?"

His suspicions lay bare. Though Guan Yu belonged to Cloud Azure Sect, he consorted with the heir of Demon Soul Sect—an impermissible transgression. The Demon Lord's displeasure was evident, and matters would worsen should Patriarch Xuanming learn of this affair. Cloud Azure Sect would never sanction such relations. Guan Yu's current predicament would pale against future repercussions—expulsion or execution. All knew Guan Yu practiced dual cultivation of magic and martial arts.

"Does your entanglement with Rong'er not fear Cloud Azure's discovery?" the Demon Lord pressed.

**Chapter 3642: Not So Shameless**

Guan Yu sighed inwardly. Though their union wasn't wholly voluntary, as a man he couldn't shirk responsibility. "Lord Demon, though circumstances compel me, having consummated this relationship, I swear not to fail Xiaorong. Our sect affiliations remain irrelevant."

"Truly irrelevant?" The Demon Lord's voice sharpened. "Do you comprehend Cloud Azure's retribution? Were you to emerge unscathed, Demon Soul Sect's gates would welcome you. But I know Xuanming's ilk—they'd strip your cultivation before granting mercy. Survival itself would be benevolence."

Nodding gravely, Guan Yu acknowledged considering these risks. "Should matters escalate, I'll resist subjugation. I'm no brainwashed disciple. If attacked, I'll escape—or perish trying."

He added, "Presently, only we three know. So long as you remain silent, Cloud Azure won't discover us soon."

"Rest assured—I favor rather than despise you. Your joining us would please me, but should you refuse, I'll tolerate your bond with Rong'er."

"Thank your trust. Should Cloud Azure learn of this, let the leak stem not from you. Many there wish me ill—discretion is vital."

"Naturally. I'd never harm my daughter through careless speech. Such treachery would disgrace me." The Demon Lord's retort halted as Wang Xiaorong returned.

"Father, who's being shameless now?" she teased.

"Enough! Must you choose a Cloud Azure disciple? You vex me deliberately!" He jabbed a finger at Guan Yu.

"What of Cloud Azure? I love whom I choose! Guan Yu won't stay forever. We'll depart for his homeland, escaping these conflicts."

"Depart? Never!" The Demon Lord thundered. "You're my sole child! When I age, who'll protect me from enemies? Must I die abandoned?"

Guan Yu interceded gently, "Lord Demon, understand this—any homecoming remains distant. We'd visit periodically."

Though displeased, the Demon Lord relented. His daughter's happiness outweighed sect rivalries. Secretly, he approved Guan Yu's caliber—only the youth's allegiance rankled.

"Your words console me," the Demon Lord grudged. "Today reveals my folly—a father outlived by his daughter's affections."

"Father, we'll return! I merely wish to see Guan Yu's wondrous homeland—towering stone buildings called 'skyscrapers,' technologies beyond imagination..." Wang Xiaorong's eyes shone before faltering. "...and...his five...six kept women..."

Silence fell.

**Chapter 3643: Tears Beckon**

Guan Yu's heart plummeted. Wang Xiaorong's careless admission now threatened catastrophe. The Demon Lord surged upright, table rattling.

"Explain! Six women? Now!"

Wang Xiaorong shrank, lip trembling. Guan Yu rose steadily. "Lord, I'll clarify. In my homeland, I've companions—unwed, childless. This doesn't preclude new bonds."

The Demon Lord's glare held reluctant respect for Guan Yu's courage. "So you're unattached? Then sever those ties to deserve Rong'er!"

"Father! Those are years-deep bonds!" Wang Xiaorong protested. "Should he discard them coldly, I'd despise him!"

"Better despise than share him! My daughter shan't be some petty concubine! Either she reigns as chief wife, or you part!"

Guan Yu's jaw tightened. In his heart, precedence mattered. Yet Wang Xiaorong's pleading eyes implored compromise. "Very well. Xiaorong shall hold primacy."

"See, Father? He agrees!" Wang Xiaorong clasped hands. "Perhaps those women will abandon him! Then I'll have him solely!"

"Wishful thinking," the Demon Lord grumbled, though mollified. "You vex me, child! Countless suitable men exist, yet you choose this... this..."

Tears glistened in Wang Xiaorong's eyes. The Demon Lord's wrath dissolved. "Rong'er... I seek only your honor. He must pledge your status."

Guan Yu explained, "My homeland recognizes no hierarchy among partners—all equal."

"I care not! Rong'er leads, or you leave!" The Demon Lord's fist shook. Under Wang Xiaorong's desperate gaze, Guan Yu nodded.

"Good!" She embraced her father. "All will resolve in time!"

**Chapter 3644: Aging Parent**

The Demon Lord sighed. "You've always opposed me. Even in love, you choose forbidden fruit. How shall I face our sect?"

"Secrecy suffices," she offered. "We needn't proclaim it."

Guan Yu objected, "We can't hide forever."

"Better you hide than die and endanger Rong'er!" the Demon Lord snapped. "Your death matters little, but harm her, and—"

"Father! Don't speak so!" Wang Xiaorong massaged his shoulders. "You'll sicken from rage."

"Hmph! At least you care. But mark this—your man either makes you chief wife, or departs!"

Wang Xiaorong kissed his cheek. "He promised! Besides, those women might leave him. Then I'm sole mistress!"

The Demon Lord's sternness wavered. "Willful girl... Must you test me so?"

Guan Yu observed their interplay—a doting father and spoiled daughter, yet beneath lay profound love. Wang Xiaorong's willfulness stemmed from lifelong indulgence, yet in love, she'd found her match.

As tensions eased, Guan Yu recognized the long road ahead—balancing affections, loyalties, and survival in a world where love crossed forbidden boundaries.
