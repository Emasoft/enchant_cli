Guan Yu thought to himself that this seemed like a roundabout way of conducting business, but it was just as well. Since Wang Jun had no use for the token, selling it for silver would be more practical.

Wang Jun glanced at Guan Yu and hurriedly said, “Well, since we’re also heading to the auction, let’s put my token up for sale. Young Master, will you keep yours or sell it?”

**Chapter 3892: Fetching a Good Price**

“That won’t do. Only one of the three of you is permitted to sell a token. Please understand,” Fan Tong immediately interjected. If all three were sold, it would damage the auction house’s reputation.

Wang Xiaorong quickly added, “I’m not short on money, nor do I need any. Besides, this token holds sentimental value. I’ll keep it as a memento—it might prove useful later.”

Though the token seemed insignificant to Wang Xiaorong, it held great sentimental value as something she had obtained alongside Guan Yu. Thus, she decided to keep it.

Wang Jun said, “Very well, I’ll auction mine. Second Master Fan, could you handle this matter for me?”

Fan Tong smiled. “Of course. All honored guests receive priority treatment. Please sign the agreement, stating the item and reserve price. After the sale, we’ll take a two percent commission. Any objections?”

Wang Jun nodded. “None at all. A two percent commission is quite reasonable. As for the reserve price, I’ll set it high. Even if it doesn’t sell, your house guarantees a two-million-silver buyback. Let’s set the reserve at two million.”

“Excellent. Please follow our staff to finalize the agreement. We’ll safeguard your VIP token in the meantime,” Fan Tong replied.

Guan Yu found this arrangement satisfactory. Reputable establishments operated with clear rules, ensuring trustworthy transactions. There was no fear of underhanded tricks here.

Naturally, if the auction house lost a client’s item, they would compensate for it. A two percent fee was modest, and the venue’s prestige and security made it ideal for fetching top prices.

For those with rare treasures, this was the best place to sell. Even buyers from the capital sought out this auction house.

The Zhongjie Auction House enjoyed immense fame across the jianghu, drawing large crowds—critical for maximizing profits.

Of course, only quality items were accepted. Counterfeits were nearly impossible to slip past their expert appraisers, and worthless goods were rejected outright.

Led by a steward, Guan Yu’s group entered the auction hall—a spacious venue starkly different from those in Huaxia. Rows of square tables, each surrounded by wooden chairs, evoked an old-world theater.

The front rows featured lavish armchairs beside long tables, facing a raised stage over ten meters long. This was where items would be displayed.

Guan Yu noted the near-capacity crowd. The event’s popularity exceeded his expectations.

With the auction yet to begin, the hall buzzed with chatter. A steward guided the trio to front-row seats. “Honored guests, your seats await. Refreshments will arrive shortly.”

“We’re sitting here? How splendid!” Wang Xiaorong giggled, delighted by the lively atmosphere.

Guan Yu sat beside her, offering an unobstructed view of the stage. Wang Jun settled on his other side, remarking, “These VIP perks are impressive. That armor of yours wasn’t a waste, Guan Yu. Enjoying such treatment is a rare pleasure.”

“But how can those in the back see anything?” Guan Yu wondered aloud. Without screens or speakers, the distant crowd would struggle to view the stage or hear announcements.

Wang Jun chuckled. “Why fret over others? Focus on ourselves. This daytime crowd is already overwhelming—imagine the evening rush!”

“Most here are serious buyers or sellers,” Guan Yu observed. “The turnout is astonishing.”

Soon, a steward delivered tea and pastries. Guan Yu, slightly hungry, nibbled a cake while surveying the room. “Look—the VIP sections beside us remain empty. Fan Tong claimed few hold such status, and it seems true.”

No sooner had he spoken than a man took a seat in the adjacent VIP area. Wang Jun smirked at Guan Yu, who grimaced at the timing.

Suddenly, Fan Tong emerged onstage, his bald head gleaming under candlelight. “Ladies and gentlemen, please settle down!”

His voice, amplified by spiritual energy, silenced the hall. Guan Yu realized Fan Tong used magic to project his voice—a clever substitute for modern amplifiers.

**Chapter 3893: Prosperity (Part 1)**

Ingenious. Guan Yu mused that the auction house surely had methods to display items clearly, even without technology.

Fan Tong continued, “Welcome! As always, today’s offerings are exceptional. Zhongjie Auction House accepts only the finest goods. Let’s begin with our first item!”

Applause erupted as attendants brought forth a small wooden box.

“This first item is a rarity,” Fan Tong declared. “Our house has prohibited its sale for years—today marks a singular exception.”

Impatient shouts arose: “Open it already!”

Fan Tong obliged, revealing a silver token. “This VIP token grants unrestricted access to all Zhongjie auctions. Its owner, Honored Guest Wang Jun, has opted to sell it. Such tokens are exceedingly rare.”

Murmurs rippled through the crowd. Some dismissed it as a status symbol, but Fan Tong pressed on: “While sellers may find it less useful, buyers and merchants will value its privileges. The reserve is three million silver, with increments of one hundred thousand. Begin!”

Silence followed. Three million seemed exorbitant for a token. Wang Jun remained unperturbed—the house’s two-million buyback ensured no loss.

Guan Yu worried the bid would flop, but attendants then circulated the token among the crowd, letting patrons inspect it closely—a low-tech solution to visibility.

Fan Tong resumed his pitch: “Crafted from purest silver by master engravers, this token is nearly impossible to counterfeit. Its value will only appreciate. To earn one normally requires spending five million gold here—a sum beyond most lifetimes. This may be your only chance to own such a treasure!”

As murmurs shifted from skepticism to interest, a group of tall, stunning women entered—their revealing attire drawing stares. Guan Yu wondered if they were part of the auction.

**Chapter 3894: Prosperity (Part 2)**

They approached the VIP section, flanking other guests with flirtatious chatter. When two moved toward Guan Yu, Wang Xiaorong shot to her feet, eyes blazing. “Touch him, and I’ll skin you alive!”

Under Fan Tong’s signal, the women gracefully presented a fruit platter before withdrawing. The display, Guan Yu realized, was a tactic to stoke desire for VIP privileges—and the token’s value.

Wang Jun whispered, “Guan Yu, did you see Xiaorong’s reaction?”

“Are you two gossiping about me?” Wang Xiaorong snapped, though the hall’s noise muffled her outburst. “And you!” She glared at Guan Yu. “Regretting those hussies left?”

“I didn’t say anything!” Wang Jun protested, wary of her temper.

Guan Yu interceded, “Xiaorong, Wang Jun is my friend. Could you ease up a little?”

“I-I didn’t mean to order him,” she stammered, softening. “I’ll try to change.”

Wang Jun muttered to Guan Yu, “Her jealousy is formidable. How will you handle it?”

Guan Yu grinned. “Don’t worry. I’ll manage.”

As Wang Jun imagined future chaos should Xiaorong discover Guan Yu’s other romantic entanglements, Fan Tong’s voice boomed again, heralding the start of bids—and the token’s fate.
