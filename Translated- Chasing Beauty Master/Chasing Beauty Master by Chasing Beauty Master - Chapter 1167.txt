The club was indeed packed today, so crowded that turning around seemed difficult. Stepping on shoes must have been a common occurrence.

Perhaps because the little old man's brand-new white sneakers had just been purchased, he couldn't bear to let go after having them trampled.

The burly man shot Guan Yu a sidelong glance, then cautiously looked at Yang Conghan. Knowing this wasn’t the place to cause trouble—if they’d been outside, he’d have already beaten the other party senseless—he held back. After all, this was the Yang family’s territory. Anyone who stirred trouble here would face dire consequences, and few dared to cross that line.

The little old man was clearly an out-of-towner who’d stumbled into the grand opening for the free offerings.

“Take your filthy hand off me!” the burly man snapped coldly. “How much could those rags be worth? I’ll pay you.” He knew starting a fight here was unwise and chose to compromise.

He’d already plotted to settle the score once the old man left. For now, he’d pay up, then beat the money back out of him later. Patience was key.

**Chapter 2989: How Dare You Brag About It**

“Let’s all stay calm,” Guan Yu interjected. “There’s no problem we can’t solve, especially something this trivial. Talk it out peacefully.”

The burly man knew Guan Yu’s reputation and the power of the Yu Gang. Not someone to provoke, he softened his tone. “He’s the one making a fuss! So what if I stepped on his foot? With this crowd, I’ve been stepped on plenty today too. Why’s his trashy shoe such a big deal?”

“Trash? You know nothing!” The old man retorted. “All your shoes combined aren’t worth mine! You want to pay? Then pay up now, or you’re not leaving!”

Yang Conghan moved to intervene, needing to resolve the disruption before it affected patrons. She signaled security, but Guan Yu stopped her. “This can be settled without ejecting anyone.”

Eager to stay for the coveted gold membership, the burly man relented. “Fine. How much?”

The old man finally released him. “These shoes cost fifty at the supermarket. Worn less than an hour, and now they’re ruined! My toes are crushed—probably skinned raw!”

With a resigned sigh, the man pulled out his wallet, thrusting a hundred-yuan note forward. “Fifty, right? Take a hundred. Enough?”

The old man snatched the bill, stuffing it into his pocket with a grin. “Should’ve done this sooner! Since you paid, the shoes are yours!” He began removing his sneakers.

“Keep your rags!” The man waved him off. “Not worth the soles of my insoles. How dare you brag about them?”

“A deal’s a deal!” The old man insisted, peeling off the reeking shoes. A stench of rotten fish engulfed the area.

His socks—once white—were now yellowed and filthy, toes poking through holes. Blackened nails and oozing sores completed the grotesque sight. The stench drove Yang Conghan to cover her face and flee, likely to vomit. Patrons recoiled, security moving in to eject the source of the miasma.

“You can have the shoes,” the old man declared, “but not the insoles. They’re family heirlooms!” He extracted the “heirlooms”—two rectangular fragments of what Guan Yu recognized instantly.

“A treasure map!” Guan Yu exclaimed.

The crowd surged forward, ignoring the stench. The old man chuckled. “Sharp eyes, boy! My grandfather left these. Said they lead to legend, but I’ve never cracked it.”

The fragments—clearly part of a square map split lengthwise—had served as insoles. Tossing the shoes to the burly man, the old man vanished into the crowd with his prize. Guan Yu called after him, “Wait! Would you sell those?”

“Depends on your offer!” echoed back before he disappeared.

As servers sprayed air freshener, the burly man whispered, “Was that real?”

“Absolutely,” Guan Yu announced loudly. “I’ve seen enough maps to know. That fragment’s genuine.”

The crowd buzzed. A treasure worth millions? Everyone wanted it. Soon, patrons upstairs joined the chase, but the old man—now barefoot—had vanished.

**Chapter 2990: Using Poison to Counteract Poison**

This spectacle was no accident. Guan Yu had orchestrated it, casting the old man and burly man to unveil a “fourth” map fragment. The ruse aimed to keep Bill Lin lingering—Guan Yu had unfinished business with him.

The crowd became unwitting propagandists. News of the map’s appearance at Hua Ye Club spread swiftly, reaching Bill Lin’s ears and permeating the city.

For safety, Guan Yu directed the old man—Elder Xie, one of the Jianghu’s Ten Great Villains—to consign the map to the Yangs’ auction house. Too many eyes now hunted it.

Elder Xie’s backstory unfolded: A poisoned youth raised by lions, he’d cultivated a gruesome art requiring animal organ consumption, which ironically neutralized his toxins but left him prematurely aged. Listed among the Ten for allegedly eating human viscera, he retained a twisted morality—preying only on the wicked.

Xu Jinglei had recruited him years earlier, saving him during a qi deviation crisis by supplying ox and tiger organs. Grateful, Elder Xie owed her a life debt. Now, that debt brought him to Guan Yu’s scheme.

Though the club act reeked literally and figuratively, its impact was indelible. The stench lingered in Guan Yu’s nostrils as he plotted a long bath back at Qiao Garden.

**Chapter 2991: The Most Pressing Concern**

At the Feng residence, Bill Lin reclined, eyes closed, as Poison Widow and Luo Bo awaited his response. A subordinate reported the map’s reappearance—the very news Bill Lin had awaited.

To Bill Lin, the map was both crucial and trivial. He’d bid exorbitantly not for treasure, but to thwart Guan Yu. Now, with a fourth fragment surfacing, the game escalated.

Elder Xie’s theatrics had set the stage. Guan Yu’s next moves would entwine ambition, deception, and the relentless pursuit of power—all while navigating the Jianghu’s shadowy tides.
