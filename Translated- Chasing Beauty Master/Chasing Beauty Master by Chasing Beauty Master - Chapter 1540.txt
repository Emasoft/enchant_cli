The old man was rather frustrated. He had been certain of winning the silver coins within the red circle, but unexpectedly, someone had placed such a large silver ingot in the blue area. Still, the red side seemed to have more coins overall, so he had no choice but to declare red the winner.

As he counted the silver, he grumbled, “Ah, another loss. This round’s a loss too.”

Xiao Zhi happily bent down to collect his winnings. At that moment, the old man glanced up and studied him, realizing this man’s presence tonight would make profiting difficult. If things didn’t improve, he’d have to relocate soon.

When the old man looked up, Xiao Zhi happened to meet his gaze mid-motion. Xiao Zhi froze—that piercing stare…

The old man shuddered. This was unmistakably the same person who had groped him earlier. He then noticed the two figures still standing nearby.

“You’re…” Xiao Zhi’s words trailed off as recognition flashed in his eyes. The disguised old man was none other than the thief who had slapped him earlier.

Xiao Zhi had initially doubted his eyes, but the clarity in the other’s gaze—along with that hint of sorrowful worry—was unforgettable.

The impostor now appeared tense. Though his hands continued moving steadily, his gestures betrayed urgency.

Wang Jun, meanwhile, remained oblivious, failing to recognize the “old man” as the thief in disguise.

“Xiao Zhi, what’s wrong? Is the silver counterfeit?” Wang Jun asked.

“No.” Xiao Zhi shook his head tersely, his eyes locked on the figure.

Assuming all was well, Wang Jun continued gambling. When others bet on red, he chose blue. Noticing red’s higher stakes, he strategically avoided overloading it to secure steady wins, though occasional losses reminded him of the old man’s manipulations.

The disguised thief grew increasingly vexed. Tonight’s encounter with these two had brought terrible luck. Continuing here would yield nothing, and having already earned enough for his parents’ medical fees, he plotted an exit.

After several more rounds, Wang Jun profited handsomely but grew irritated as others began mirroring his bets. When he stopped, the crowd followed suit, ruining everyone’s chances.

Exasperated, Wang Jun muttered, “These fools don’t understand basic strategy!”

Xiao Zhi, having observed silently, suddenly lunged forward, seized the impostor’s wrist, and dragged him away.

“Hey! Where are you going?” Wang Jun called out, suspecting a robbery. With no alternative, he gave chase.

The remaining gamblers, all losers, shouted protests: “Don’t let him escape with our silver!”

Wang Jun, realizing the thief’s potential wealth, joined the pursuit while theatrically yelling, “Capture this swindler! Deliver him to the magistrate!”

The crowd hesitated at the mention of authorities—illegal gambling rings feared exposure—allowing the trio to escape.

Xiao Zhi pulled the struggling figure through winding alleys until they reached a deserted lane. The impostor wrenched free, demanding, “Release me! What’s your game?”

When the thief reverted to a clear, melodic voice, Xiao Zhi halted, turning sharply. “Why disguise yourself? A proper young lady shouldn’t resort to this.”

“None of your business!” She rubbed her reddened wrist, her demeanor shifting.

Xiao Zhi hesitated, questioning his own motives. “I’ll intervene because…” He grasped for justification. “You struck me. I’m owed repayment.”

Studying his swollen cheek, she almost laughed despite herself. Tossing off her ragged cap, cascading black hair framed her face as she retorted, “You deserved it! Don’t pretend ignorance.”

Xiao Zhi found himself captivated by her defiant beauty. “It was an accident! I’d have apologized without the violence.”

“Apologies mean nothing,” she snapped. “Be grateful I didn’t kill you.”

Undeterred, Xiao Zhi pressed, “Regardless, I saved you tonight. My friend would’ve outplayed you eventually.”

She conceded silently, acknowledging the truth. When Xiao Zhi offered her dagger back, she eyed him warily, suspecting ulterior motives regarding her stolen silver.

Wang Jun’s sudden reappearance startled them. “Planning to split loot?” he joked.

“Enough nonsense,” Xiao Zhi chided.

The thief retreated cautiously as Wang Jun approached. Producing a small vial, she tossed it to Xiao Zhi. “Apply this to reduce swelling.”

Clutching the vial, Xiao Zhi insisted, “We mean no harm. We’re disciples of Yunqing Sect on a mission.”

Wang Jun, observing their dynamic, feigned embarrassment. “I’ll leave you lovebirds alone,” he quipped before departing.

Alone, tension thickened. Xiao Zhi fumbled, “Rest awhile? You must be exhausted…”

“State your purpose,” she demanded. “I’ll cooperate if you don’t touch my silver.”

“We need nothing,” Xiao Zhi assured. “We intervened on principle. I’m Xiao Zhi of Yunqing Sect—Head Zheng is my father.” To prove his claim, he summoned a thunderbolt that shattered a boulder, astonishing her.

“I’m Du Bingyan—call me Xiaoyan,” she finally relented. “I’ve always dreamed of joining Yunqing Sect. With magic, I could heal my parents honestly…”

Her story unfolded—a once-happy family destroyed by corrupt officials, her parents comatose from beatings, her desperate thefts to fund their medical care.

“Take us to them,” Wang Jun interjected, reappearing. “We’ll assess if spiritual healing can help.”

At the clinic’s crowded ward reeking of antiseptics, Xiaoyan led them to her parents’ beds. Wang Jun surveyed the dismal conditions, doubtful yet determined. Though modern medicine struggled with comas, perhaps mystical arts held answers...
