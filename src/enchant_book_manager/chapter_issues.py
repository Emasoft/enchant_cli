# HERE IS THE CHANGELOG FOR THIS VERSION OF THE CODE:
# - Created new module from chapter_detector.py refactoring
# - Contains issue detection logic for chapter sequences
# - Includes detect_issues function

"""
chapter_issues.py - Issue detection for chapter sequences
=========================================================

Contains functions to detect issues in chapter numbering sequences,
including missing numbers, repeats, swaps, and out-of-place chapters.
