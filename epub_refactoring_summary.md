# EPUB Refactoring Summary

## Overview

Successfully refactored the EPUB creation process to work with complete translated text files instead of individual chunk files, following the proper architectural design where chunks are internal to cli_translator.py.

## Changes Made

### 1. **make_epub.py**
- Added new function `create_epub_from_txt_file()` that:
  - Takes a complete translated text file as input
  - Parses chapter headers from the text content (not filenames)
  - Validates chapter sequence if requested
  - Creates EPUB with proper TOC based on detected chapters

### 2. **cli_translator.py** (lines 1214-1235)
- Updated `save_translated_book()` to use the new `create_epub_from_txt_file()` function
- Now passes the complete translated text file instead of collecting chunks
- Removed dependency on chunk filename format for EPUB creation
- Maintains proper separation: chunks for API management, chapters for book structure

### 3. **enchant_cli.py** (lines 244-266)
- Updated Phase 3 (EPUB generation) to:
  - Look for "translated_{title} by {author}.txt" file
  - Pass complete file to `create_epub_from_txt_file()`
  - Let make_epub parse Chapter headers from text content
  - Build TOC based on actual chapter structure in the text

## Key Architectural Improvements

1. **Proper Separation of Concerns**:
   - Chunks: Internal to cli_translator for API limit management (Chunk_NNNNNN.txt)
   - Chapters: Book structure parsed from text content by make_epub ("Chapter N" headers)

2. **Single Source of Truth**:
   - The complete translated text file is the authoritative source
   - Chapter detection happens by parsing text, not by reading filenames

3. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Existing functions remain for legacy support
   - New function adds capability without breaking existing code

## Test Results

- ✅ Chapter detection from text content works correctly
- ✅ EPUB creation from complete text file successful
- ✅ TOC generation based on detected chapters works
- ✅ Validation of chapter sequence functions properly
- ✅ Empty file handling works gracefully
- ✅ Generated EPUBs contain all required files (mimetype, content.opf, toc.ncx)

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Workflow**: No need to collect and sort chunk files for EPUB
2. **Accurate TOC**: Based on actual chapter headers in the text
3. **Flexible**: Works regardless of how the text was chunked for translation
4. **Maintainable**: Clear separation between translation units and book structure
5. **Future-Proof**: Easy to add features like custom chapter detection patterns

## Usage Example

```python
# In cli_translator.py
success, issues = create_epub_from_txt_file(
    txt_file_path=output_filename,  # Complete translated text
    output_path=epub_filename,
    title=book.translated_title,
    author=book.translated_author,  
    cover_path=None,
    generate_toc=True,  # Parse chapters from text
    validate=True,
    strict_mode=False
)
```

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. Add support for cover images in the orchestrator
2. Allow custom chapter detection patterns via config
3. Add more sophisticated chapter title extraction (subtitles, etc.)
4. Support for different output formats beyond EPUB
