Wishing everyone a happy New Year in advance, and talking about the new book

Originally planned to release the book these days, but with the New Year approaching, releasing it now would certainly have few readers. The new book's performance would inevitably be greatly affected. During the Spring Festival, everyone is busy, and annual traffic will drastically decrease. After much consideration, I have to apologize to everyone, the new book is scheduled for February, around the tenth day of the first lunar month. Once again, I apologize and thank everyone for your support. 2020 will definitely not disappoint you.

It's very regrettable, delaying the release of the book for a few days

Originally planned to release the book tomorrow, but the website is not operating. I can't sign a contract. Now the whole country is fighting against the epidemic, and the website's working hours have been postponed to the 10th. So I can only wait for the editor to return before releasing the book. Apologies, deeply sorry! I'm also very anxious, I need to release the book to earn money. Otherwise, there's no milk for my child. Poorly, brothers, wait for me a few more days, remember to support me!

New book release, please collect and recommend!

The new book "The Cataclysm of the Ten Thousand Clans" has been released. Originally planned to wait a few more days, but worried about the holiday delay, I decided to release it directly. Brothers, support me!

Collecting and recommending requires no money. Let the data look good, thank you all!

If you can't find the book title by searching, directly search for "Eagle Eating Chicks" author's name. You can see the books under his name, it's "Eating Chicks" not "Capturing Chicks", don't make a mistake...

A matter to mention, about the physical book

Briefly speaking, both "The Cataclysm of the Ten Thousand Clans" and "Global Martial Arts" simplified Chinese edition physical books have been published, co-published with Zhuimengren Publishing House.

The contract was signed not long ago. I thought publishing would take one or two years, but it turned out to be quite fast, and the printing and publishing have already started.

"The Cataclysm of the Ten Thousand Clans" and "Global Martial Arts" have both published the first five volumes. They are currently on pre-sale, about one million words in total. JD.com, Tmall, and Dangdang are all on pre-sale. Just search directly. Those who want to buy can place an order now. Five volumes are quite expensive, after all, it's a physical book. The official sales will probably be around the 20th. Now placing an order, it should be shipped around the 20th.

Subsequent content is still being published. Brothers and sisters who want to buy, please check by yourself.

Additionally, I mentioned before, some brothers and sisters said they wanted signed copies... Oh my god, don't mention the signature. When I signed the "Global Martial Arts" commemorative album, some shameless people took my signature and posted it online. That's embarrassing! My signature is so beautiful, why do they all envy me and deliberately say it's ugly!

Of course, if you really want a signed edition, we'll see later.

Also, if you really buy it and have any opinions or suggestions, directly tell the manager. Let the manager collect the opinions and pass them on to me. I'll communicate with the publisher.

No more words, single chapters are already open. By the way, I'm asking for monthly votes. Wait until the end of the month for double voting? No need, at the end of the month everyone should vote. I, Eagle, can't be shortchanged by your monthly votes? By the end of the month, writing 700,000 words, anyone has votes. Now we have votes, let's go up!

That's it, good night, sleep early, I'm going to take care of the baby!

The little eagle has been restless recently. I need to tidy it up!

New book "Star Gate" released!

I've already released two chapters, but the review needs time. Not sure when it will appear. It should be before 12 o'clock. The new book is a bit difficult, the original title was "Crimson Moon Overhead," but it's been changed now. No way, after all, fate is full of twists and turns. Fortunately, it's上线 after a ten-day delay, but it's quite troublesome. I hope brothers and sisters can support it more, recommend and collect.

No more words, the new book still hopes for your support, give a little confidence. If you don't like it, you can also collect it, after all, collecting doesn't cost money, right?

Thank you all. "Star Gate" goodbye!

Chapter One: The Script Is Wrong

April 5, 2008.

Saturday.

Yangcheng No.1 High School, Class 4, Grade 12 classroom.

Fang Ping spent half an hour finally confirming one thing: it wasn't a dream, not filming. Filming could make his classmates rejuvenate, this production company could go to the sky!

After confirming the fact of reincarnation, Fang Ping had a small hesitation, then calmly accepted it.

As a new century's five-venom youth, who hasn't had the experience of reincarnation?

Even if he himself didn't reincarnate, there were plenty online. Just by looking, it's the ultimate treasure for a short and ugly person to rise to be a rich and handsome one!

Moreover, he had no money, no girlfriend. Reincarnated, not doing anything could still live longer. No matter how you calculate it, it's a win.

After finally getting the class to end, the familiar yet somewhat strange teacher took a few extra minutes before reluctantly leaving.

As for the last sentence the teacher said when leaving, Fang Ping just thought he had misheard.

"Registration for the Martial Arts Examination starts next week. Students with ideas should prepare."

Fang Ping didn't take it seriously, he thought it was "Liberal Arts" registration. College entrance exams are usually pre-registered, but generally handled by the school, so there's no need to remind again.

The key point is that Class 4, Grade 12 is a science class, unrelated to liberal arts?

But with the reincarnation thing, Fang Ping didn't care about such trivial matters.

At this moment, Fang Ping was thinking about punching Jack Ma and kicking Ma HuaTeng.

Although the time of 2008 was a bit late, if a reincarnated person didn't do something unexpected, could it be called a reincarnated person?

Or not from business, but from politics?

Fang Ping was secretly calculating, didn't have the heart to chat with classmates.

These young people couldn't imagine the grand goals in his mind. From today on, we are not from the same world!

While Fang Ping was planning for his future, the tall and sturdy Yang Jian in front of him suddenly turned around and asked: "Fang Ping, Chen Fan, are you going to register?"

Fang Ping had a deep impression of Yang Jian, not because Yang Jian was extremely handsome.

The key is that after graduation, when Fang Ping and his high school classmates had a reunion, the newly graduated Yang Jian had a full beard, almost making Fang Ping think that Yang Jian's father also came to the class reunion.

From then on, Fang Ping never forgot this bearded classmate, his features were too obvious.

Thinking about things, Fang Ping didn't think to respond at the moment.

Fang Ping's deskmate, one of the members of the "Ordinary Two Group" joked by classmates, Chen Fan, at this time shook his head and said: "I won't register. It's a waste of money.

Registering costs ten thousand, it's sure to fail, with so much money, the university tuition and living expenses for a year would be enough."

Yang Jian sighed: "Yes, but there's still some regret. Not trying is afraid of lifelong regrets."

Yang Jian's deskmate, also a male, whose name Fang Ping had some vague memories of, joined the discussion at this time, his face gloomy: "This is our only chance to leap over the dragon gate. Unfortunately, it's irrelevant to us."

The three sighed and regretted, listening to Fang Ping with a headache, completely confused.

Register?

What the teacher just said was "Liberal Arts" registration?

Registration fee is ten thousand?

This is 2008, if I'm not mistaken, the city's housing prices in Yangcheng were around 4000 per square meter. Why would the exam registration cost so much?

These guys didn't say it wrong, right?

Or were they cheated?

Fang Ping was about to ask, his deskmate Chen Fan adjusted his glasses and said with determination: "Even if we don't take the Martial Arts Examination, taking the Liberal Arts is not necessarily a lifetime of no way out!

There are also martial arts training schools in society. After we graduate, when we earn money, we can also study.

Even if it's not as good as martial arts students, at least there is a chance!"

This statement made Yang Jian's deskmate also excited: "Right, take the entrance exam for a prestigious liberal arts university. After graduation, the salary and benefits won't be low!"

"I still want to try..." Yang Jian hesitated. His family background was relatively good, plus his strong body, he didn't want to miss the chance.

For Yang Jian's desire to try, Chen Fan and others didn't stop him. Although the hope was slim, the opportunity was right in front of them, and there were always people who couldn't bear it.

Although they were still young, they also understood that at this time, if they discouraged Yang Jian, it would definitely create a big grudge.

The three discussed heatedly. At this moment, Fang Ping was completely confused.

What's going on?

Swallowed his saliva, Fang Ping looked at the three for a while, didn't see any joking or teasing intentions. At this point, Fang Ping finally felt something was wrong.

Just about to ask, he was again cut off by someone else's words.

Fang Ping and his classmates' desks had two boys whispering. At this time, they probably thought the number of people was too small for discussion.

After Fang Ping's group became quiet, the boy next to them with a short haircut, full of excitement and joy, said: "Yang Jian, Chen Fan, did you watch the news online last night?"

Yang Jian and the others shook their heads. With the college entrance exam approaching, the family was strict now, there was no time to go online.

Seeing that they were unaware, Fang Ping and the other boy also looked puzzled. The short-haired boy smiled: "That's a pity!

Last night there was a big news!

Do you know? Ma Master broke through to the eighth rank!

Master Ma is under 40 this year, already the top martial arts strength of the younger generation.

Yesterday, Tencent Group formally issued a challenge letter to the Asia-Pacific regional director of Google, an old eighth-rank master named Tem.

"What?"

"Really or not?"

"Master Ma broke through to the eighth rank? He wasn't just promoted to seventh rank a few years ago?"

"Unbelievable!"

"Zhang Hao, tell me, is it an open challenge or a private one?"

"Eighth-rank battle, I really want to watch, but we have no chance to attend..."

Senior high school students, approaching the college entrance exam, few of them go online after class. So the news from last night, although it caused a sensation, few people in the class knew about it.

The short-haired boy, Zhang Hao, spoke loudly just now.

After he finished speaking, Fang Ping's group hadn't had a chance to respond yet, and the classmates nearby became excited.

Zhang Hao, at this time, also enjoyed the joy of being the center of attention, his face full of happiness: "It's true!

Master Ma really broke through! Not only us, who in the world would believe he could break through to the eighth rank so quickly?

So when the challenge letter was issued, the whole world was shocked!

If Master Ma defeats Tem this time, Tencent Group can vigorously expand into Asian countries and become one of the dominant groups in Asia!

In a few years, if Master Ma breaks through to the ninth rank, Tencent Group can become one of the world's dominant groups!"

"Wow, this is too fast, eighth-rank Master!"

"The ranking of the Masters has been updated? Master Ma is about to enter the top thirty!"

"Go away, not top thirty, I think it's top twenty."

"Not that much, Master Ma just broke through, how could he rise to the top twenty so quickly? Unless after defeating Tem, there's still a chance."

"..."

At this time, the classmates started discussing among themselves. Everyone's eyes showed excitement, admiration, excitement, and longing.

Even the girls were no exception at this time.

The only exception in the entire class was Fang Ping.

At this moment, Fang Ping's mind was a mess, his face was bewildered, and he was completely stunned.

What's going on?

He understood every word they said, and if written down, he would definitely recognize each character.

But why, when combined together, he completely didn't understand?

Who is Master Ma?

Tencent Group he certainly knew, in 2008, Tencent Group was already a giant in the IT industry.

Google he also knew, it's impossible not to know.

The meaning of what Zhang Hao said was that Tencent and Google are competing in business?

But why... why is it so awkward!

Fang Ping's throat moved again, feeling his lips were very dry. This script, it seems a bit wrong!

Chapter Two: Must Take the Martial Arts Examination!

In the classroom.

Fang Ping was completely confused, his heart uneasy.

After finally waiting for everyone to discuss enough, Fang Ping poked Chen Fan next to him and whispered: "Ma... Master Ma, is it Ma HuaTeng?"

Chen Fan's face changed instantly, becoming serious and said: "Fang Ping, directly calling the Master's name is the greatest disrespect!"

Fang Ping: ""

At this moment, Fang Ping felt like crying. Wow, even the name can't be mentioned, Xiao Ma's prestige is so intimidating, it's more terrifying than the president.

But Fang Ping also confirmed one thing: the boss of Tencent is indeed Xiao Ma.

The company is correct, the boss is also correct. The only thing that's wrong is the martial arts strength mentioned by everyone.

It feels like something strange, awkwardly mixed in, making Fang Ping feel as if there was a thorn in his throat.

Suppressing the urge to argue, Fang Ping casually said: "I've been busy preparing for the college entrance exam recently and haven't watched any news. Tell me, listen to something interesting?"

Chen Fan didn't take it seriously: "It's still the same old thing, just Master Ma breaking through to the eighth rank is a bit unexpected."

Chen Fan isn't too fond of gossip, but the future bearded Yang Jian in front is quite talkative.

At this time, the class bell hadn't rung yet, Yang Jian also heard Fang Ping's question and turned around to whisper: "There aren't many big news, but a few days ago I saw some gossip news and knew a little bit of inside information. Not sure if it's accurate.

I heard that Master Li from Alibaba might break through to the seventh rank, becoming a master!

Master Li from Baidu is also preparing for seclusion, breaking through to the eighth rank. Master Li's time of breaking through to the seventh rank is almost the same as Tencent's Master Ma, but in recent years, Master Li's martial arts progress is not as fast as Master Ma's, whether he can break through is uncertain.

By the way, there's another piece of news, our province's Governor Zhang may break through to the seventh rank soon.

Once Governor Zhang breaks through to the seventh rank, it will be no small matter. Our province has been weak for many years, now there are only a few old-generation seventh-rank masters stationed in the region. Governor Zhang is not very old, if he breaks through, he has the potential to further advance and eliminate the long-standing weakness of our province's martial arts.

Also, before this year's Martial Arts Examination, our school apparently invited a senior student who was admitted to the South Jiang Martial Arts University last year to give a speech..."

Yang Jian continuously spoke about gossip, but Fang Ping felt like he was listening to a foreign language.

The gossip news Yang Jian spoke about was mostly related to martial artists.

Someone might break through, someone is in seclusion.

Among these, some names Fang Ping had heard before, not limited to the business world, including the entertainment industry and even the political field.

From some of Yang Jian's casual words, Fang Ping could feel that martial artists hold a very respected position in this society. Yang Jian used "Master" as a suffix for martial artists below the seventh rank, and for those above the seventh rank, they were called "Master."

Another point could also be seen: all famous people seem to be martial arts masters.

Or in other words, if you're not a master, you can't become famous.

During this time, Fang Ping casually asked how strong these people were?

Yang Jian was very rude and said: "Any martial artist can beat us into a sieve!"

When the class bell rang, while the teacher hadn't come yet, Yang Jian sighed: "If you can't take the Martial Arts Examination and become a martial artist, your life is over.

Being an official doesn't go beyond the city level, doing business is the same. Ordinary people want to stand out, it's hard!"

This statement made Fang Ping stunned again.

And the previously quiet Chen Fan also felt a bit disappointed, lowly said: "Martial artists are few in number. Even for us, whether from business or politics, we probably can't reach that level, so there's no need to care about these."

Through the two's conversation, Fang Ping vaguely felt something.

Not becoming a martial artist, according to his understanding, officials won't exceed the department level, doing business can't go beyond other cities.

Whether it's a hard rule or an unspoken convention, Fang Ping could feel the strong hostility of this society!

Not becoming a martial artist, not being a strong person, even if he was reincarnated, he would probably be stuck in the underclass forever.

The key is, now Fang Ping seriously doubted whether he was really reincarnated?

Although the classmates' appearances and names didn't change, including those big shots, the company names all matched up.

But suddenly a high-energy profession emerged. Are other things really the same as his memory?

He wanted to ask a few more questions, but at this moment the teacher had already entered the classroom, others returned to their seats, no more chit-chat.

Moreover, these things were common knowledge in others' eyes. Fang Ping didn't want to ask further.

If he asked more, these guys would probably suspect him of amnesia.

Thinking about it, taking advantage of the teacher's back turning, Fang Ping whispered to Chen Fan: "Our school... is there an internet cafe near the school?"

Chen Fan looked at him strangely for a moment, but still replied: "Of course there is. You used to often go to the Blue Sky Internet Cafe, right?"

"Phew!"

Fang Ping exhaled, nodded and didn't say anything more. It seems some things are still the same.

For example, this name-typical internet cafe is still there. Since the internet cafe exists, some things haven't changed. He could go to the internet cafe after school to check for information he wanted to know.

Seeing Fang Ping relieved, Chen Fan still kindly reminded: "Although we can't take the Martial Arts Examination, we shouldn't give up. If you do well in liberal arts, there's still a chance to stand out. Maybe in the future, you can also become a martial artist.

The college entrance exam is approaching, the internet cafe should be less frequent..."

Fang Ping smiled and nodded. As a member of the "Ordinary Two Group," Chen Fan, although not talkative, had similar conditions to him. He was relatively concerned about his deskmate.

...

After enduring the remaining classes in the morning, when the school bell rang, Fang Ping hurriedly went out.

At this time, he had a lot of doubts to resolve.

Seeing Fang Ping rushing out, Chen Fan thought for a while and caught up with him: "Are you going to eat or go to the internet cafe?"

"Internet cafe."

"Come back early, the first class in the afternoon is the head teacher's class."

Fang Ping nodded. At this time, his parents were both working, he had lunch at a fast food restaurant near the school, no need to go home.

Taking advantage of the noon break, his strong desire for knowledge made him want to go to the internet cafe as soon as possible to find out some things he didn't know.

With quick steps, Fang Ping briefly scanned the surrounding environment.

It was the same as in his memory, Yangcheng No.1 High School had no differences, classmates and teachers were all normal, Fang Ping didn't see anyone leaping over walls.

The only difference was that there were some strange promotional slogans and signs in the school.

"Prepare for the college entrance exam, I'm coming to the Martial Arts Examination!"

"Fight hard, strive for the Martial Arts Examination!"

"Take the Martial Arts Examination, come to Qingniao Martial Arts Tutoring Class, your best choice!"

"A drop of blood qi pill, ensure you pass the Martial Arts Examination!"

"..."

If these strange things weren't openly appearing in the school, Fang Ping would have had reason to believe that charlatans and sellers of vitality pills had entered the school.

But at this moment, seeing everyone's usual attitude, Fang Ping understood that this was ultimately not his memory world.

As for how big the difference was, he would have to find out.

...

Ten minutes later, Fang Ping arrived at the Blue Sky Internet Cafe, not too far from the school.

Still familiar smell, still familiar signboard.

The internet cafe that once looked quite high-end now appeared dilapidated, the words "Blue Sky Internet Cafe" were almost unreadable.

Stepping into the internet cafe, the female net manager sitting at the counter was still a familiar yet somewhat unfamiliar young girl.

In those days of hormonal youth, the mature-looking female net manager who dressed more mature than students had once secretly entered Fang Ping's dreams, doing some naughty things.

Now looking at her...

Fang Ping felt his eyes in his youth must have been a bit crooked.

Also, if she were truly beautiful, what would she be doing as a net manager?

Scanning the female net manager, Fang Ping didn't have the heart to flirt. Even if he did, this level of girl wasn't suitable for a high-class reincarnated person.

But thinking about "Master Ma," that innate sense of superiority instantly vanished.

Reincarnated people are indeed high-class, but the key is to reincarnate in the right place!

Muttering a few things in his heart, Fang Ping didn't hesitate and went straight to the point: "Turn on a computer, how much per hour?"

"Three yuan."

The female net manager answered directly and then said: "Are you a member? If not, become a member. Charge 50 and get 10."

Fang Ping looked arrogant, didn't want to bother with her.

Charging 50 for only 10 is too stingy!

Moreover... which eye of yours sees that I have 50 yuan?

After the morning classes, Fang Ping had already figured out his assets. All wealth was 28 yuan.

This money included his lunch money, it would be hard to come up with 50 yuan.

Ignoring the net manager's sales pitch, Fang Ping took out a five-yuan bill from his pocket and proudly slapped it on the counter.

Of course, the female net manager also ignored him, threw over a temporary membership card and didn't bother with him anymore.

Fang Ping wanted to shout "Don't mock the poor youth," but considering the net manager's level was too low, he saved this for the big shots later and didn't argue with the net manager anymore. He took the temporary membership card to the corner of the internet cafe.

...

In the corner of the internet cafe.

As the computer turned on, Fang Ping eagerly searched for the information he wanted to know.

The blue light of the monitor reflected on Fang Ping's face, making it look a bit sinister.

If someone sat next to Fang Ping at this moment, they could feel his abnormality.

Sometimes his face changed, sometimes he was angry, sometimes he gritted his teeth...

Sometimes a few national curses came out of Fang Ping's mouth, not sure whether it was cursing heaven or someone else.

After more than an hour, the machine automatically shut down, and the internet fee was used up.

Fang Ping didn't want to recharge anymore. With some confusion and realization, he stepped out of the internet cafe.

As he stepped out of the internet cafe, his face became determined, gritting his teeth and saying: "Take the Martial Arts Examination!"

As if it wasn't enough to prove his determination, Fang Ping added: "I must take the Martial Arts Examination!"

Chapter Three: Poor Literature, Rich Martial Arts

Outside the internet cafe.

Fang Ping's expression was resolute, his eyes full of determination.

He couldn't be indifferent!

Through more than an hour of browsing and searching, Fang Ping finally figured out some things.

For example, what is a martial artist?

Modern martial artists are not much different from the wuxia novels and movies of the previous era, just the background is modern. The profession of martial artists has openly appeared in modern society.

If it were just the appearance of this high-energy profession, Fang Ping would have been interested in supermen, but it wouldn't necessarily have to become a martial artist.

But in today's society, martial artists are not just a high-energy profession, but also mean power and status!

Survival of the fittest, an eternal truth.

In the past, this difference wasn't too obvious, because everyone was a common person who could be knocked down by a bullet.

But in this society filled with martial arts masters, the difference was obvious and clear.

For example, Fang Ping previously said to Yang Jian that being an official doesn't go beyond the city level and doing business is the same, he didn't understand it deeply. Now he completely understood.

Ordinary people are the mainstream of society, and ordinary people can engage in any industry without restrictions.

But according to law, yes! The law clearly states!

A company that wants to develop across the city must have a martial artist as its legal representative, regardless of rank.

And if you want to develop across provinces, the company's legal representative has a rank requirement, not lower than the fourth rank of martial arts!

According to the information Fang Ping found online, today's martial arts are divided into nine ranks, with the first rank being the lowest and the ninth rank the highest.

Those below the fourth rank are low-level martial artists, while those above the seventh rank including the seventh rank are high-level martial artists, known as Master-ranked strongmen.

To establish a company that can develop across provinces, the first thing is for the legal representative of the company to be a martial artist with a rank above the fourth level.

To become a multinational group, although there is no legal requirement, Fang Ping also briefly checked online and found that without a seventh-rank martial arts level, even if your company's products are good and the audience is large, recklessly entering other countries or regions would be like sending money to die.

Even if the group has a seventh-rank martial artist, you still need to prove your strength.

For example, today's Ma HuaTeng!

Tencent's products are similar to the previous era, mainly instant messaging. QQ has always been the main online communication tool in China.

But it's limited to China!

Tencent can't even enter Asia now because Ma HuaTeng's strength has reached the seventh rank, but as a world-class group, Google also developed an instant messaging software. The strongman stationed in Asia by Google is an eighth-rank martial artist.

Ma HuaTeng can't prove his strength and compete for resources with Google, so he can't expand outside the country.

Because when you send people to expand outside the country, they might disappear overnight.

Only by proving your expansion strength to the outside world and competitors can you expand safely. This is why Ma HuaTeng chose to challenge Tem immediately after breaking through to the eighth rank.

This challenge, the outcome is not important. The key is to prove that Ma HuaTeng has now become an eighth-rank top master, and has the right to share the pie.

This is the rule of the business world, and other fields are similar.

For example, politics, slightly different from before. Within a province, the governor has the most power. The governor of a province is at least a fourth-rank martial artist.
