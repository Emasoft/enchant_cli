When Jiang Cheng returned to Fu Yuan Restaurant, he walked towards Mo Qingyun and the others with a grim expression.

“Boy, your courage is quite impressive. You dared to stay here after injuring me.”

Arriving in front of Mo Qingyun, Jiang Cheng’s expression turned狰狞, his eyes coldly staring at Mo Qingyun.

“Your courage is also impressive. After I beat you up, you still dared to come back.”

Mo Qingyun remained calm and indifferent as he said this.

“Jiang Cheng, was it this boy who injured you?”

An elder beside Jiang Cheng walked out and asked him.

“That’s right, Uncle Jiang Qun, this boy injured me.”

Jiang Cheng said angrily.

Hearing Jiang Cheng’s answer, Uncle Jiang Qun’s face darkened and he coldly said to Mo Qingyun, “Boy, your courage is impressive. You dared to cripple someone from our Jiang family. I wonder if you are tired of living.”

“Are people from the Jiang family really that impressive?”

Mo Qingyun sneered at Uncle Jiang Qun’s words.

“Indeed, arrogant and overbearing. No wonder you dared to injure someone.”

Uncle Jiang Qun’s face darkened again and he said, “Boy, I don’t care who you are. Since you dared to injure someone from our Jiang family, today even if you were a dragon, you would have to submit. If now you voluntarily cripple yourself and sever your hands and legs, I might spare your life out of kindness.”

Actually, this elder dared to say so mainly because he recognized some direct descendants from major families in Lianyun City.

He confirmed that Mo Qingyun was not among them, so when he said this, he had no worries.

“Now I tell you to take them away and break his legs. Then, I won’t bother with you.”

Mo Qingyun looked at the elder disdainfully and pointed to Jiang Cheng, saying.

“Uncle, this boy is too arrogant. Don’t waste words with him; just have someone cripple him.”

Jiang Cheng then said to Uncle Jiang Qun, “Uncle, this boy is too arrogant. Don’t waste words with him; just have someone cripple him.”

He then pointed to Mo Xin and the three girls beside him, saying, “Uncle, you said recently you wanted some new fun. I think these girls are quite suitable to be your concubines.”

“Indeed, they look very fresh. They would make good choices as concubines.”

Uncle Jiang Qun glanced at Mo Xin and the three girls beside him, his eyes sparkling with excitement. He nodded with a lecherous smile.

Then he instructed the two middle-aged men beside him, “Jiang Ping, Jiang Tao, cripple this boy for me. But don’t take his life; I want to torment him slowly and let him know the consequences of offending our Jiang family.”

Under Uncle Jiang Qun’s gaze, Mo Xin and the three girls beside him moved closer to Mo Qingyun.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun’s expression turned cold as he prepared to take out Du Luo’s identity card and intimidate them.

Just then, three terrifying auras pressed into Fu Yuan Restaurant.

Bang bang bang!

Under these powerful auras, some bowls and wine bottles in the restaurant were instantly crushed.

“Who dares to touch my disciple!”

At the same time, a voice filled with anger echoed in everyone’s ears.

Then they saw three figures rush to Mo Qingyun’s side.

Bang bang!

Jiang Ping and Jiang Tao, who were about to attack Mo Qingyun, were sent flying by Du Luo and his companions.

These three figures naturally belonged to Du Luo and his companions.

Upon arriving, the trio looked at Mo Qingyun with concern and asked, “Good disciple, who is bullying you? Did anyone hurt you? Let me teach them a lesson.”

“Had you come a bit later, I would have been injured.”

Mo Qingyun felt somewhat surprised at their arrival and pointed to Uncle Jiang Qun and the others, smiling faintly, “It’s these guys.”

“Is it you who bullied my good disciple?”

Upon hearing this, Du Luo and his companions immediately pressed their aura towards Uncle Jiang Qun and the others.

“He… they are Qingyun’s masters. This aura is even stronger than Grandfather’s!”

Seeing this scene, Mo Xin and the three girls beside her widened their eyes in shock. They swallowed hard.

They looked at Mo Qingyun with a gaze as if he were a monster, feeling incredulous and amazed.

They never imagined that Mo Qingyun had such powerful backing in Lianyun City.

At this moment, they finally understood why Mo Feilin said that as long as they followed Mo Qingyun, they didn’t need to worry about details.

With such powerful backing, those who dared to trouble Mo Qingyun in Lianyun City were indeed few.

Of course, the Jiang family could be considered an exception because of their bad luck. Du Luo and his companions happened to come here.

Otherwise, if Mo Qingyun had taken out Du Luo’s identity card as the Guild Master, their fate would have been better.

“Du… Du Luo Guild Master, Zhao Qi Master, and Xu Yu Master!”

When Mo Xin and the three girls were shocked, Uncle Jiang Qun also looked at the trio with a look of terror.

Thinking about facing Du Luo and his companions’ anger, Uncle Jiang Qun’s face turned ashen and he trembled all over.

The Jiang family was only a second-rate force in Lianyun City, and he had provoked the Alchemy Guild. This was truly reckless.

Using his common sense, Uncle Jiang Qun knew that this time he had really made a big mistake.

After the initial shock, Uncle Jiang Qun quickly guessed Mo Qingyun’s identity. Who else could be a disciple of Du Luo and his companions besides the young alchemist Mo Qingyun, who was rumored to have the best alchemy talent in the Alchemy Guild?

“You… you are Mo Qingyun, the young alchemist?”

Uncle Jiang Qun’s face turned pale as he asked Mo Qingyun with trembling lips.

“Alchemist?”

Mo Qingyun looked at Du Luo and his companions in confusion when he heard this.

Seeing this, Du Luo smiled and said, “Good disciple, you probably didn’t know. In Lianyun City now, your reputation is quite high. They call you Young Alchemist.”

“Haha, so it’s like this!”

Mo Qingyun smiled faintly when he heard this.

He hadn’t expected such a situation to happen.

Hearing the conversation between Mo Qingyun and his companions, Jiang Qing’s heart was filled with bitterness. He regretted it to the extreme.

Before he arrived, why didn’t he investigate Mo Qingyun’s background? He just believed what Jiang Cheng said.

Now, many families in Lianyun City were looking for opportunities to befriend this young man.

He was about to attack him, directly offending Mo Qingyun.

Jiang Qun knew that if he didn’t handle this matter well, he would become a千古罪人 (a person with great sin) in the Jiang family.

Thinking of this, he looked at Jiang Cheng beside him as if with a sharp knife in his eyes. He wished to tear Jiang Cheng apart.

If looks could kill, Jiang Cheng would have been killed countless times by Uncle Jiang Qun’s gaze.

If it weren’t for this fool, Jiang Cheng, who had offended Mo Qingyun with his blind eyes, he wouldn’t be in this predicament.

This time, he was really tricked by Jiang Cheng.

As for Jiang Cheng at this moment, he was completely stunned. His legs were trembling uncontrollably. He had offended the Young Alchemist.

He was doomed now. Thinking of this, a puddle formed in his pants.

Seeing Jiang Cheng’s actions, the surrounding people looked at him with disdain. This guy was too useless; he had been scared to pee.

Seeing Jiang Cheng’s actions, Uncle Jiang Qun glared at him angrily but also knew that the most important thing now was to calm Mo Qingyun’s anger.

“Alchemist, I know I was wrong. Please give me a chance to make amends.”

Uncle Jiang Qun then knelt in front of Mo Qingyun and pleaded, “I didn’t know it was you before. If I had known, even if ten bulls dared me, I wouldn’t have offended you.”

At this moment, Uncle Jiang Qun didn’t care about his face anymore.

In his view, as long as he could calm Mo Qingyun’s anger, it was worth kneeling.

“Oh, is that so?”

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun smiled playfully and said, “Didn’t you say before that I should cripple myself and sever my hands and legs?”

“I… it wasn’t what I meant. It was just that my mouth is too sharp, and I should be hit.”

Uncle Jiang Qun slapped his own face as he spoke.

Soon, his face swelled and blood flowed from the corner of his mouth, making him look somewhat bloody.

Seeing this scene, everyone in Fu Yuan Restaurant was stunned. Uncle Jiang Qun really slapped his own face and did it so fiercely.

But thinking about it, they felt relieved. It was worth slapping a few times to save his life.

Women are soft-hearted animals; seeing Uncle Jiang Qun, an old man, slapping his own face until it was bloody.

Mo Xin and the three girls beside her looked at Mo Qingyun with pity and said, “Qingyun, why don’t you let it go? After all, we are fine.”

Hearing Mo Xin and the three girls’ words, Mo Qingyun sighed involuntarily. “Mo Xin and these girls are still too naive.”

But since they had spoken, Mo Qingyun nodded in agreement and said to Uncle Jiang Qun, “You are lucky. Considering Mo Xin’s request for you, I will forgive you this time. But your actions disturbed our meal; shouldn’t you compensate us with a few hundred thousand gold coins?”

A few hundred thousand gold coins!

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, everyone was stunned and swallowed hard. They looked at Mo Qingyun in amazement.

This young alchemist was too greedy; he asked for a few hundred thousand gold coins as compensation for a meal.

But thinking about Mo Qingyun’s identity, everyone felt it reasonable. He was the Young Alchemist; how could ordinary people compare with him?

Even if he gave a few thousand gold coins, would the Young Alchemist look at it?

Although they thought this way, everyone still looked at Uncle Jiang Qun with sympathy.

He was in trouble!

As for Mo Xin and the three girls beside him, they felt dizzy when they heard this. Their heads were empty.

A few hundred thousand gold coins was too huge for them.

Compared to everyone’s shock, Uncle Jiang Qun felt as if he had heard a heavenly sound when Mo Qingyun said this.

He was afraid that Mo Qingyun wouldn’t ask for compensation, which meant that Mo Qingyun hadn’t truly decided to let it go.

Now that Mo Qingyun had spoken, it meant that he was willing to let it go and wouldn’t pursue them.

Thinking of this, Uncle Jiang Qun eagerly took out his乾坤袋 (a magical bag) and handed it to Mo Qingyun, saying, “There are over thirty thousand gold coins here. I hope the Young Alchemist can accept it.”

After handing out his乾坤袋, Uncle Jiang Qun felt a pang in his heart. This was the savings of half his life.

But compared to his life, Uncle Jiang Qun didn’t think much about it. Money could be earned again; a lost life couldn’t.

Over thirty thousand gold coins!

Hearing Uncle Jiang Qun’s words, everyone was surprised again. This Jiang Qun was generous; he offered over thirty thousand gold coins.

The three girls beside Mo Xin were even more excited. They clenched their fists and looked at Mo Qingyun with surprise.

So fierce, he asked for over thirty thousand gold coins right away!

If Mo Xin and the three girls hadn’t seen it with their own eyes, they wouldn’t have believed it.

At this moment, Mo Xin and the three girls couldn’t help but think that compared to Mo Qingyun, Mo Cang was nothing.

Could Mo Cang have such skills?

“You are reasonable.”

Mo Qingyun nodded in satisfaction and pointed at Jiang Cheng, saying, “But I don’t want to see him appear before me again.”

“Yes, yes, yes…”

Uncle Jiang Qun nodded hurriedly and looked at Jiang Cheng with resentment. “From today on, Jiang Cheng is no longer a member of our Jiang family. Also, break his legs and throw him out of Lianyun City.”

“Yes, Uncle Qun.”

The people behind Uncle Jiang Qun nodded in response.

“Uncle, don’t! Young Alchemist, I was wrong. Please forgive me; treat me like a dog…”

Jiang Cheng’s voice became smaller and smaller as he was dragged out of Fu Yuan Restaurant.

“Young Alchemist, are you satisfied with this result?”

After instructing the people behind him, Uncle Jiang Qun asked Mo Qingyun with a flattering look.

“You can go now!”

Seeing Jiang Cheng’s legs broken and being dragged out, Mo Qingyun waved his hand impatiently.

“Yes, I will go now.”

Then Uncle Jiang Qun and the others hurriedly left Fu Yuan Restaurant.

They seemed to be worried that if they walked slowly, Mo Qingyun would change his mind.

“Your return caused a stir. Let your master clean up the mess for you.”

After Uncle Jiang Qun and the others left, Zhao Qi pretended to be displeased as he glared at Mo Qingyun.

“You are idle. Walking around can also add some fun, right?”

Mo Qingyun smiled and said to Du Luo and the others.

“You are right.”

Zhao Qi shook his head, glared at Mo Qingyun again, and said, “Good disciple, I have a piece of good news for you.”

“A big piece of good news?”

Mo Qingyun was surprised and looked at Du Luo with curiosity.

“That’s right, it’s about your apprenticeship.”

Du Luo added, “After you returned, we three considered from your perspective. We thought it was too difficult for you to choose one of us as your master, since we are all excellent masters.”

“…”

Hearing Du Luo’s words, Mo Qingyun was speechless. How thick-skinned could these three old men be?

Could they boast without limits? Did they think that boasting wouldn’t kill them, so they could keep boasting?

Of course, Mo Qingyun didn’t say this out loud. He continued listening to Du Luo’s explanation.

Ignoring Mo Qingyun’s expression, Du Luo said, “So we three decided to take you as disciples at the same time. How do you feel? Are you happy, surprised, or delighted?”

“Three of you take me as a disciple at the same time?”

Mo Qingyun was speechless and completely convinced by Du Luo and his companions.

These three old men could think of such a thing, which was indeed difficult for them.

Seeing Mo Qingyun stunned on the spot, Du Luo and his companions immediately showed off their smug smiles.

They thought Mo Qingyun was so delighted that he couldn’t speak.

“See, I told you. This kid would be happy when he heard this.”

Xu Yu laughed and exchanged glances with Du Luo, then said, “Look, he is so happy that he can’t speak.”

“I took him as a disciple too,” Zhao Qi said shamelessly.

“Pfft, it was me!” Du Luo also argued without shame.

For a moment, the three old men started arguing again.

Seeing this scene, everyone in Fu Yuan Restaurant looked at Mo Qingyun with envy. What a stroke of luck to be taken as disciples by Du Luo and his companions at the same time.

“Qingyun, are they really your masters?”

Seeing Du Luo and his companions’ actions, Mo Xin and the three girls beside her were shocked and asked Mo Qingyun.

They didn’t expect that these three super experts were actually Mo Qingyun’s masters.

This discovery shocked them greatly.

“Haha, you can say so.”

Mo Qingyun smiled bitterly and nodded helplessly. Originally, he thought that with Du Luo and his companions’ abilities, they were not enough to be his masters.

But now seeing their actions, Mo Qingyun was moved and accepted their behavior.

It wasn’t a bad thing to have them as masters; what was there to be ashamed of?

Reborn in this life, it was rare for someone to care about him so sincerely. This was the most precious thing.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun opened his mind a lot and looked down on those titles more.

For a while, Mo Qingyun seemed to enter a mysterious state. His soul instantly elevated and his soul power rapidly increased.

“Spiritual Form Realm.”

Feeling the increase in his soul power, Mo Qingyun was ecstatic and excited.

In a short moment, his soul power cultivation directly jumped over the first realm of Separation from Mundane Realm and entered Spiritual Form Realm.

Soul power cultivation also had many realms, namely Separation from Mundane Realm, Spiritual Form Realm, Spirit Essence Realm, Divine Spirit Realm, Heavenly Palace Realm, Myriad Phenomena Realm, Creation Realm, and Unification with Dao Realm.

Among them, Separation from Mundane Realm was equivalent to the True Qi Realm of martial artists. The rest followed this pattern.

But Mo Qingyun knew that his soul power cultivation increased so quickly mainly because in his previous life, his soul power was strong and reached the Myriad Phenomena Realm.

Now it was just a recovery, not true improvement.

But even so, for Mo Qingyun, this was still good news. He would gain many more skills and even against low-grade True Essence Realm martial artists, he had a chance to survive. It was an additional self-protection ability.

At this moment of Mo Qingyun’s joy, Du Luo and his companions noticed the three girls beside him.

“Ah! I overlooked these three young ladies just now.”

Hearing Mo Xin speak, Du Luo looked surprised and said to Mo Qingyun, “Good disciple, are these three young ladies your wives?”

“Good disciple, you have good eyes. These three young ladies are all very nice.”

Zhao Qi and Xu Yu nodded in agreement.

“Wives?”

Hearing Du Luo’s words, Mo Xin and the three girls beside her were sweating coldly. They looked at Du Luo with a bitter smile, secretly cursing him as “old and not respected.”

But although they thought this way in their hearts, Mo Xin and the three girls didn’t dare to say it out loud.

Mo Ling looked at them respectfully and explained, “Senior, they are not what you think. We are just his clan sisters and clan nieces.”

“Oh, that’s a pity.”

Zhao Qi said with disappointment after hearing this.

“However, since you are Qingyun’s clan members, I will give you some small gifts.”

Then Zhao Qi took out three bottles of pills and gave them to Mo Xin and the three girls.

“Body Refinement Pills!”

Mo Xin and Mo Xiao were surprised when they saw the pills in the bottles.

These pills looked exactly like the Body Refinement Pills Mo Qingyun had given them before. The only difference was that their medicinal power concentration was slightly lower, indicating a slightly lower grade.

“You recognize these pills?”

Seeing Mo Xin and Mo Xiao recognizing the pills in the bottles, Du Luo and his companions were somewhat surprised.

But after thinking about it, they understood and smiled. “It seems that Qingyun must have told you something about alchemy.”

“No… it’s not like that.”

Seeing Du Luo and his companions misunderstanding them, Mo Xin explained, “Before Qingyun gave me and Xiao Xiao a few Body Refinement Pills each, so we recognized them.”

After Mo Xin replied to Du Luo, she looked at Mo Qingyun with a scolding look and said, “You naughty boy. You told us that you made these Body Refinement Pills yourself; it’s like talking nonsense.”

“…”

Seeing Mo Xin misunderstand him, Mo Qingyun looked helpless and smiled bitterly. “Indeed, I made them myself.”

“You gave Body Refinement Pills to Qingyun?”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s helpless look, Du Luo and his companions looked at each other in confusion. They hadn’t given Mo Qingyun Body Refinement Pills.

Where did his Body Refinement Pills come from then?

Could it be…

Mo Qingyun really made these Body Refinement Pills himself?

This thought made Du Luo and his companions ecstatic. They asked Mo Qingyun eagerly, “Good disciple, have you advanced to a Second-Rank Alchemist?”

“More or less.”

Seeing Du Luo’s understanding, Mo Qingyun didn’t explain further. He couldn’t tell them that he could even refine Third-Rank pills now, which would probably scare them and cause chaos in Lianyun City.

He wouldn’t have a peaceful life then, which was not what Mo Qingyun wanted to see.

Sometimes being too outstanding wasn’t good either. This principle, Mo Qingyun understood well.

“Qingyun is a Second-Rank Alchemist?”

Mo Xin and the three girls beside her were shocked when they heard Du Luo’s words. They widened their eyes in surprise and looked at Mo Qingyun, asking, “Then… the Body Refinement Pills before were really made by you?”

“Of course. Where else would they come from?”

Mo Qingyun looked frustrated.

“You didn’t tell us, making us guess!”

Mo Xiao and Mo Xin glared at Mo Qingyun with displeasure.

“I didn’t tell you?” Mo Qingyun looked innocent and smiled bitterly. It seemed that he had told the two girls, but they didn’t believe him.

“Women’s words are always right. In their eyes, there is no reason.”

Mo Qingyun deeply understood this truth at this moment.

“Originally, we were worried that you would have some difficulty entering the Alchemy Cave.”

Knowing Mo Qingyun had advanced to a Second-Rank Alchemist, Xu Yu smiled with relief and nodded repeatedly. “Now it seems we were overthinking; you have already advanced to a Second-Rank Alchemist.”

“What is the Alchemy Cave?”

Mo Qingyun looked puzzled and asked Du Luo and his companions.

“The Alchemy Cave was originally a place in the Alchemist Alliance where discarded pills were thrown.”

Xu Yu explained to Mo Qingyun, “But over time, the medicinal power from these discarded pills accumulated and formed a cultivation paradise.”

“After this discovery, the seniors in the Alchemist Alliance sealed it with an array and opened it periodically to let outstanding young members of the alliance cultivate there,” Zhao Qi added.

“Oh, so that’s how it is!”

Mo Qingyun looked enlightened. The Alchemy Cave was similar to Mo Family’s Spirit Palace.

“What are the requirements for entering the Alchemy Cave?”

Mo Qingyun asked.

“To enter the Alchemy Cave, you need to win first place in a competition among young members of the Alchemist Alliance.”

Xu Yu explained, “If you want to enter, you need to compete with Yue Taiwen and the others for first place.”

“Recently, I heard that Yue Taiwen had a strange encounter and advanced to a top First-Rank Alchemist. Originally, we were worried that you would have some trouble winning against him then, but now it seems we were overthinking.”

Du Luo chuckled and seemed very satisfied with Mo Qingyun’s advancement to a Second-Rank Alchemist.

“Yue Taiwen advanced to a top First-Rank Alchemist!”

Mo Qingyun was slightly surprised when he heard this and then smiled playfully.

After smiling, Mo Qingyun asked, “When will the competition for Alchemy Cave entry start?”

“Three days later!”

Du Luo said.

“Well, three days later, I will compete with them!” Mo Qingyun said seriously.

He missed the opportunity to enter the Spirit Palace before, so he didn’t want to miss this chance for the Alchemy Cave.

If he could cultivate in the Alchemy Cave, it would be a good choice.

“Good disciple, do you want to come with us to the Alchemist Alliance?”

Zhao Qi invited Mo Qingyun.

“I will accompany Mo Xin and the others to tour the city first, then I will go alone.” Mo Qingyun replied.

“Alright, we’ll leave now.”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s words, Du Luo and his companions didn’t hesitate to return to the Alchemist Alliance.

After Du Luo and his companions left, Mo Qingyun and the others also left Fu Yuan Restaurant without lingering.

After leaving the restaurant, Mo Qingyun smiled at Mo Xin and the others and said, “Mo Xin, Mo Ling, Xiao Xiao, now that we have money, where do you want to go next?”

“You are showing off!”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s actions, Mo Xin and the three girls beside her rolled their eyes at him and said with a smile, “Let’s go to the silk shop. I saw one earlier; their fabrics are very good.”

“Alright!”

Then Mo Qingyun and the others went to a silk shop called Silk Melody.

Silk Melody was very large, filled with various brocades and silk fabrics.

“Wrap up all these fabrics and send them to my residence immediately!”

When Mo Qingyun and the others entered the fabric shop, a handsome young man said to the shopkeeper.

This young man was dressed in fine clothes and exuded an elegant aura, clearly a person of wealth.

When Mo Qingyun entered Silk Melody, this young man looked surprised and walked towards him.

“Are you Young Alchemist Mo Qingyun?”

The young man asked with a surprised tone when he reached Mo Qingyun.

“You know me?”

Seeing the young man recognize him, Mo Qingyun was surprised and asked.

“Nowadays, a prominent figure in Lianyun City and the alchemist with the best talent in the Alchemist Alliance, how could I not know you?”

Wan Yue Xuan chuckled and said.

He clearly remembered that his father had instructed him to befriend Mo Qingyun if he got the chance.

“Haha, I didn’t expect my reputation to be so high.”

Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and asked, “Young Master, do you have something to ask me? I don’t seem to know you.”

“Look at my brain.”

Wan Yue Xuan smiled awkwardly and slapped his head. “I’m Wan Yue Xuan. I don’t have anything important; just want to be friends with you, Young Alchemist.”

“Young Master Wan, are the items ready? Should we send them now?”

At this moment, a shop assistant asked Wan Yue Xuan while he was talking to Mo Qingyun.

“This…”

Hearing the assistant’s words, Wan Yue Xuan looked hesitant and then handed a token to Mo Qingyun. “Young Master Mo, this is my identity card. You can come to my residence anytime with it.”

“Are you from the City Lord’s Mansion?”

Mo Qingyun looked surprised when he took Wan Yue Xuan’s identity card.

He didn’t expect that this young man was from one of the four major forces in Lianyun City, the City Lord’s Mansion.

“Haha, my father is the City Lord of Lianyun City.”

Wan Yue Xuan chuckled and said apologetically, “Young Master Mo, I’m sorry. I have some matters to attend to today; I’ll take my leave now. Welcome to visit me anytime.”

“Let’s go!”

Wan Yue Xuan said and hurriedly left with the assistants.

“Qingyun, who is that guy?”

Mo Xin and the three girls beside her walked over curiously.

“A rather interesting fellow.”

Mo Qingyun smiled at Mo Xin and the others’ question, putting away his token.

Now he had contacted two of the four major forces in Lianyun City. He wondered what the other two would be like.

“Oh, come and see; we picked some nice fabrics.”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s answer, Mo Xin and the three girls didn’t ask further. They pulled Mo Qingyun to look at the fabrics.

Then, Mo Qingyun and Mo Xin and the three girls started selecting fabrics.

About an hour later, they picked several nice fabrics. They had their sizes measured and the fabrics were sewn into clothes.

After finishing this, Mo Qingyun and the others left the silk shop and returned to Greenwood Trading House.

When they arrived at Greenwood Trading House, Mo Qingyun noticed that there were many more workers in the trading house.

“Qingyun, you’re back?”

Seeing Mo Qingyun and the others return, Mo Feilin greeted them. “Tired from shopping? I’ll take you to the resting place.”

Then Mo Feilin led them out of Greenwood Trading House.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun was puzzled and said, “Uncle Si, our resting place is not in Greenwood Trading House?”

“Yes, recently the business of Greenwood Trading House has improved. We hired many new employees, so we moved some guest rooms to dormitories for them.”

Mo Feilin smiled awkwardly and said, “So I arranged your resting place in a city inn.”

“Oh!”

Mo Qingyun and the others looked enlightened after hearing this. They followed Mo Feilin to the inn.

On their way, Mo Qingyun frowned and thought, “I will stay in Lianyun City for a long time. It’s not good without a place to rest. I need to find a residence in Lianyun City.”

This thought rooted in Mo Qingyun’s mind.

Mo Qingyun arranged his accommodation at the inn and then went to the Alchemist Alliance. Half an hour later, he arrived at the Alchemist Alliance.

To his surprise, as soon as he entered the Alchemist Alliance, he met Yue Taiwen and others coming towards him.

Seeing Mo Qingyun, Yue Taiwen immediately showed a look of hatred and said disdainfully to him, “Mo Qingyun, I heard you also participated in the competition for Alchemy Cave entry?”

“Are you afraid?”

Mo Qingyun glanced at Yue Taiwen and said with a playful smile.

“Afraid?”

Yue Taiwen was surprised, then laughed loudly. “Did you hear that? Mo Qingyun said I’m afraid! Do you think it’s funny?”

“Taiwen, the leader, I’ve never heard such a funny joke in my life.”

“I think he dares to say this because he doesn’t know Taiwen’s current alchemy level.”

“If he knew that our Taiwen is already a Second-Rank Alchemist, I bet he would have been scared to pee his pants.”

“Not just peeing his pants; in my opinion, he would have been scared to crap himself.”

…

The young men beside Yue Taiwen immediately mocked Mo Qingyun.

Snap snap snap…

When these young men were laughing loudly, a sound of slapping faces echoed. Soon their faces swelled up.

Mo Qingyun directly slapped them!

Feeling the burning sensation on their faces, these young men were angry and shouted at Mo Qingyun, “Mo Qingyun, you dared to slap our faces? You are too much!”

“Too much?”

Mo Qingyun looked at them disdainfully and said coldly, “Can you spit out filth with your mouths but not let me slap your faces?”

“Mo Qingyun, are you not afraid of our revenge?”

One of the young men said with a threatening tone.

“With your lot?”
