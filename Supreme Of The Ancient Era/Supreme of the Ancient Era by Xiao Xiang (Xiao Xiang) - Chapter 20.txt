He did not expect that dealing with Mo Qingyun would be so easy for the three of them, but now a strange turn of events had occurred.

Immediately after, Da Sha and Er Sha summoned their martial souls.

One was a Level Seven Martial Soul, the Thunderous Giant Python Soul; the other was a Level Six Martial Soul, the One-Eyed Green Wind Eagle Soul.

"Boy, I will tear you to pieces and bury you with my third brother."

Da Sha roared as he attacked Mo Qingyun.

The Thunderous Giant Python Hammer

With a punch, Da Sha unleashed a torrent of true energy from his fist, like tiny currents of electricity, with an astonishing aura.

The Wind Eagle Wings

Following Da Sha, Er Sha also attacked Mo Qingyun with incredible speed, arriving in front of him in an instant.

The Soul Heaven Seal

Seeing them attack, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and immediately used the martial technique, Soul Heaven Seal.

Ah!

Two cries of pain were heard as Da Sha and Er Sha were struck by the Soul Heaven Seal, emitting screams.

After being hit by Mo Qingyun’s Soul Heaven Seal, they both turned pale with fear.

What kind of attack was this? How could it be so strange?

At that moment, they finally understood why San Sha had exhibited such a peculiar behavior earlier.

Crack!

As Da Sha was filled with fear, a crisp sound of bones breaking echoed. Er Sha’s throat was crushed by Mo Qingyun, killing him instantly.

"You…"

Seeing Mo Qingyun's actions, Da Sha, who had just recovered his senses, looked at him with fear.

"Who sent you?" Mo Qingyun asked coldly.

"Even if you kill me, I won’t say anything," Da Sha said stubbornly as he slowly backed away.

"Very well, you can join them now."

Seeing that Da Sha did not speak, Mo Qingyun attacked him directly.

The Soul Heaven Seal

Following this, another strike of the Soul Heaven Seal hit Da Sha.

Then, Mo Qingyun raised his hand and struck him down, following the path of Er Sha and San Sha.

"Boy, Xue Ming’s young master won’t let you off for killing me. He will definitely avenge me."

Before being killed by Mo Qingyun, Da Sha let out a resentful cry.

"Xue Ming?"

Hearing Da Sha’s words, Mo Qingyun was somewhat amused. This guy really was a top-notch character.

When he asked him, he would not speak even if beaten to death. But now, as he was about to die, he confessed on his own.

After slaying Da Sha and the others, Mo Qingyun did not linger. He collected their乾坤bags (Heavenly Spheres) and left.

Chapter 73: Various Reactions

Mo Qingyun was already a prominent figure in Lianyun City, attracting the attention of major forces.

Now that news of him refining a second-grade top-tier medicinal pill had spread, the various major forces were shocked.

How could he have advanced to a second-grade top-tier alchemist so quickly?

In the City Lord’s Mansion, in a secluded courtyard,

"Wan Yue Xuan, someone just reported that Mo Qingyun has advanced to a second-grade top-tier alchemist," Wan Yue Xuan said excitedly to his father, Wan Lianyun.

"What!"

Wan Lianyun’s body trembled as he tightly held his teacup, asking in shock: "What did you just say?"

"Someone reported that Mo Qingyun has become a second-grade top-tier alchemist," Wan Yue Xuan said, taking a deep breath to calm his excitement.

"A second-grade top-tier alchemist!" Wan Lianyun said in amazement, his excitement hard to calm. "It seems we underestimated this young man’s alchemy talent."

"Dad, now that he has advanced to a second-grade top-tier alchemist, should we invite him over and see if he can help with your poison?" Wan Yue Xuan asked hopefully.

"Not yet, wait until he becomes a third-grade alchemist," Wan Lianyun said, waving his hand to interrupt. "But increase the security around the Jade Palace recently; I’m worried that Mount Tai Sect might cause trouble."

"I understand, Dad," Wan Yue Xuan nodded and left the courtyard.

"A second-grade top-tier alchemist, I hope you can bring me some surprises; otherwise, Lianyun City might change," Wan Lianyun sighed inwardly, a deep concern on his face.

In Mount Tai Sect’s main hall,

"Headmaster, it is said that the Alchemy Guild’s Mo Qingyun has become a second-grade top-tier alchemist," an adult said respectfully to the headmaster.

"A second-grade top-tier alchemist? I didn’t expect this young man to grow so quickly," the headmaster said, frowning in thought. "Keep an eye on his movements and report any unusual activity to me; but don’t be too obvious, we don’t want to alert Wan Lianyun."

"Has there been any news from Xue Xiao’s young master recently?" the headmaster asked.

"Not yet," replied the adult.

"Alright, you can go now," the headmaster waved him away.

"Mo Qingyun, I didn’t expect this young man to emerge," the headmaster said with a deep expression. "I hope you don’t disrupt my plans; otherwise, I won’t mind eliminating you."

At the Dragon Heaven Gang,

They were equally shocked by Mo Qingyun’s advancement to a second-grade top-tier alchemist.

This news was too sudden for them.

From a first-grade top-tier alchemist to a second-grade top-tier in just a few months, the speed was too fast.

"Boss, Mo Qingyun has become a second-grade top-tier alchemist. Should we recruit him?" one of the Dragon Heaven Gang’s leaders asked.

"No, let’s just watch quietly," the boss said. "The City Lord’s Mansion and Mount Tai Sect will take action; we don’t want to get involved."

For the Wu family, Mo Qingyun’s advancement was most exciting.

"What? You didn’t hear wrong? Mo Qingyun has become a second-grade top-tier alchemist?" Wu Bing Tian said in shock, almost not believing his ears.

He never imagined Mo Qingyun would advance so quickly to a second-grade top-tier alchemist.

In his view, even if Mo Qingyun had good talent, it would take at least a year to become a second-grade alchemist.

"We guessed right. Such a young second-grade top-tier alchemist, his future is limitless," Wu Bing Tian said excitedly.

In Wu Bing Tian’s view, Mo Qingyun could become a fourth-grade alchemist in the future.

Building a relationship with a fourth-grade alchemist would be a great benefit for the Wu family.

...

...

Meanwhile, as news of Mo Qingyun spread widely,

He returned to Jade Palace and informed Mo Xin and the others about his plan to enter the alchemy chamber for cultivation.

Recalling his recent attack, he also instructed them not to leave during this period.

He was unsure if Xue Ming would make further moves, so it was better to be cautious.

Entering the alchemy chamber for cultivation, if something happened to them, he would not be able to handle it.

After instructing the girls, Mo Qingyun returned to his residence and began cultivating.

At this moment, he deeply felt that his cultivation was still not advancing fast enough.

In Beimozhen Town, this feeling wasn’t strong, but in Lianyun City, it was very intense.

With his current strength, he felt too weak to defend himself in Lianyun City.

If it weren’t for the Alchemy Guild, he might not even be able to stand his ground.

Not only could he not face the forces behind Xue Ming, but even the Jiang family was beyond his reach.

Strength! Strength!

It was all because of insufficient strength.

"I’m still too weak," Mo Qingyun sighed inwardly, taking a medicinal pill and beginning his cultivation.

...

The next day, Mo Qingyun left Jade Palace early for the Alchemy Guild.

"Hmm, there seem to be many more figures outside Jade Palace!"

As Mo Qingyun left Jade Palace, he noticed a strong aura around it.

Releasing his soul force to sense the surroundings, Mo Qingyun was surprised.

Around Jade Palace were dozens of True Energy Realm experts and several True Essence Realm experts.

Most surprisingly, they all came from the City Lord’s Mansion.

"Experts from the City Lord’s Mansion?"

Knowing their origin, Mo Qingyun was puzzled. Why were they guarding Jade Palace?

Releasing his soul force again to observe them, he found that they seemed normal, just guarding Jade Palace.

"The City Lord’s Mansion’s guards are protecting Jade Palace?"

Mo Qingyun was puzzled, his brows furrowed. He couldn’t understand their intentions.

Logically, he and the City Lord’s Mansion weren’t close; they had no reason to do this.

"Why are the City Lord’s Mansion guards protecting Jade Palace?"

Mo Qingyun was puzzled again, recalling Wan Yue Xuan’s actions. "Also, Wan Yue Xuan’s friendly behavior seems excessive."

After some thought, Mo Qingyun decided not to dwell on it. "Alright, I won’t think about it anymore. With the City Lord’s Mansion guards protecting Jade Palace, I can be more at ease when cultivating in the alchemy chamber."

"As for their intentions, I’ll ask Wan Yue Xuan after I come out of the alchemy chamber."

With this thought, Mo Qingyun headed to the Alchemy Guild.

...

On his way to the Alchemy Guild, Mo Qingyun noticed some people watching him.

They were well hidden; he couldn’t identify them yet.

Seeing they didn’t make any other moves, Mo Qingyun ignored them.

For him, the most important thing was to quickly improve his cultivation.

Soon, he arrived at the Alchemy Guild and went directly to Du Luo’s residence.

"Good disciple, you’re here," Du Luo said with a relieved smile as he greeted him.

Du Luo then led Mo Qingyun to the alchemy chamber.

The alchemy chamber was located behind the Alchemy Guild, in a secluded area.

Soon, two ten-meter-high stone pillars appeared before Mo Qingyun.

Above the pillars was a large plaque with ancient characters: "Alchemy Chamber."

Behind the plaque was a grand palace, exuding an imposing aura.

This was the alchemy chamber.

"Currently, the alchemy chamber has been renovated by senior guild members. It now has two floors: ground and underground. You should cultivate on the ground floor; don’t enter the underground level yet, as the medicinal essence there is too concentrated for you to absorb," Du Luo said seriously.

Then he handed Mo Qingyun a jade token. "This is your identity for the alchemy chamber; you can cultivate there for one month with this token."

"Alright," Mo Qingyun nodded.

"You may enter now," Du Luo waved him in.

Mo Qingyun entered the alchemy chamber.

As soon as he entered, a dense medicinal essence enveloped him.

Feeling comfortable like a fish in water, Mo Qingyun began his cultivation.

He summoned the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon and White Light Door martial souls, letting them absorb the medicinal essence.

The two martial souls absorbed the medicinal essence voraciously.

In moments, a vortex formed around them, swallowing the surrounding medicinal essence like a bottomless pit.

Especially the White Light Door martial soul absorbed at an incredible speed, its open door like a black hole.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly.

From their absorption speed, the White Light Door martial soul seemed stronger.

This discovery increased Mo Qingyun’s confidence in the White Light Door martial soul.

He then focused on his cultivation.

Time passed quickly during cultivation.

Five days later, Mo Qingyun’s aura surged as he broke through to the Tenth Level of Body Refinement Realm.

However, Mo Qingyun didn’t stop cultivating; he stabilized his cultivation further.

Continuing to cultivate crazily, Mo Qingyun’s strength rapidly increased:

Tenth Level of Body Refinement Realm Initial Stage,

Tenth Level of Body Refinement Realm Peak Initial Stage,

...

Tenth Level of Body Refinement Realm Late Stage.

Twenty-nine days later, Mo Qingyun’s cultivation reached the peak of Tenth Level Body Refinement Realm, just one step from True Energy Realm.

At this moment, the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul absorbed medicinal essence and became agitated.

Opening his eyes, Mo Qingyun saw the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul rush towards an underground passage.

In moments, it disappeared into the passage and entered the underground level.

"What’s happening? Why did the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul rush into the underground level?"

Mo Qingyun was puzzled, following it.

"Could there be something attracting the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul in the underground level?"

Without further thought, Mo Qingyun followed it into the underground level.

Entering the underground level, a terrifying pressure enveloped him.

Kneeling involuntarily, Mo Qingyun felt the immense weight.

"难怪老师说，让我不要贸然进入地下的一层，这里果然不是淬体境能进的。"

Feeling the heavy pressure, Mo Qingyun was surprised. "So that’s why my teacher said not to enter the underground level; it really isn’t suitable for Body Refinement Realm."

After a brief surprise, Mo Qingyun used his martial soul technique to reduce the pressure.

His cultivation instantly reached True Energy Realm.

With the reduced pressure, Mo Qingyun chased after the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul.

Soon, he saw it chasing a small white figure in an abandoned medicinal pile.

"That’s... the Medicinal Essence Spirit!"

Seeing the small figure, Mo Qingyun was surprised and excited. "There’s a natural spirit in this alchemy chamber; it’s a good thing."

Natural spirits, formed from primordial essence, could enhance one's connection to the universe’s energy.

They made it easier for martial artists to communicate with nature and understand its power.

"It was this little guy that attracted the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul," Mo Qingyun realized.

"Seal Door, seal!"

Mo Qingyun then used his martial soul technique to seal the Medicinal Essence Spirit.

Its cultivation, originally at True Energy Realm, was quickly reduced to Body Refinement Realm under the seal.

Its speed also slowed down.

Using his martial soul technique, Mo Qingyun caught up to the Medicinal Essence Spirit.

"Where do you think you’re going?"

Seeing the porcelain doll-like spirit, Mo Qingyun laughed.

The Medicinal Essence Spirit was just newly formed and lacked consciousness.

Its escape was instinctive; otherwise, Mo Qingyun would have had a hard time catching it.

Natural spirits grew rapidly and could even move mountains and seas, opening the heavens.

For example, a Supreme Realm expert on this continent was a natural fire spirit.

Their mastery of flames was divine, with terrifying power.

After capturing the Medicinal Essence Spirit, Mo Qingyun didn’t immediately refine it. He sealed and stored it in his乾坤bag (Heavenly Sphere).

He planned to refine it when he reached True Energy Realm for better results.

After storing the Medicinal Essence Spirit, Mo Qingyun continued his cultivation.

This alchemy chamber was a good place; he couldn’t waste time.

A day later, the jade token Du Luo gave him vibrated, signaling his time was up.

Mo Qingyun then left the alchemy chamber.

Before leaving, he used his martial soul technique to hide some of his cultivation.

...

Chapter 75: Body Constitution Burst

As soon as Mo Qingyun left the alchemy chamber, he saw Du Luo and the others.

They had been waiting for him.

Seeing Mo Qingyun emerge, they smiled warmly.

"Body Refinement Tenth Level, not bad!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s cultivation breakthrough to Body Refinement Tenth Level, Du Luo and the others smiled approvingly.

"Teacher, here’s my alchemy chamber token," Mo Qingyun said as he handed the jade token to Du Luo.

"Alright!" Du Luo took it and stored it in his乾坤bag (Heavenly Sphere).

"Teacher, when will the alchemy chamber be open next?" Mo Qingyun asked.

"In six months!" Du Luo replied. "But you can only enter once a year."

"Once a year," Mo Qingyun said, slightly disappointed.

If he could enter more often, others wouldn’t be able to use the alchemy chamber with his refining abilities.

After chatting a bit, Mo Qingyun left the Alchemy Guild and returned to Jade Palace.

As he exited the Alchemy Guild, he sensed someone following him.

Ignoring them, Mo Qingyun returned to Jade Palace.

To his surprise, the follower left after a while.

Mo Qingyun arrived at Jade Palace about half an hour later.

As expected, the City Lord’s Mansion guards were still outside.

Ignoring them, Mo Qingyun entered Jade Palace.

Soon, he saw Mo Xin looking worried and anxious.

"Something happened?"

Seeing her, Mo Qingyun felt a jolt. He hurried over to ask.

"Qingyun, you’re back!" Mo Xin said with relief. "You’re like a rock in the storm."

Unconsciously, they had grown dependent on him.

"Mo Ling’s hidden illness has flared up!" Mo Xin said worriedly. "Her body feels like it’s burning, and we don’t know what to do; Xiao Xiao has gone for help."

"Mo Ling’s body constitution flared up?" Mo Qingyun said, rushing to her room.

Quickly, they arrived at Mo Ling’s room.

Mo Ling was pale and sweating profusely on the bed, exuding a scorching heat.

"Thankfully, it’s not fully flared up," Mo Qingyun sighed in relief.

"Qingyun, do you have a way?" Mo Xin asked anxiously.

"Worry not, I can temporarily suppress the flames in her body," Mo Qingyun said reassuringly. "You guard outside and don’t let anyone disturb me."

"Alright!" Mo Xin nodded, guarding the door.

Seeing her leave, Mo Qingyun approached Mo Ling. "Mo Ling, I’ll help you suppress the flames in your body; tell me if anything feels wrong."

"Alright," Mo Ling weakly replied.

Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon, appear!

Summoning the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul, a terrifying flame energy filled the room.

Outside, Mo Xin was startled but stayed put as per Mo Qingyun’s instructions.

Seeing the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul, Mo Ling was stunned. "Qingyun, your martial soul..."

"I have twin martial souls; this is my other one. It can help you suppress the flames in your body," Mo Qingyun explained.

"Let’s talk about it later; I’ll help you first," he said.

"Alright," Mo Ling nodded, still amazed.

She never imagined Mo Qingyun had twin martial souls, one being a powerful Heavenly Dragon soul.

The weakest Heavenly Dragon soul was super-grade; Mo Qingyun’s must be high-grade.

Compared to Mo Cang, Mo Qingyun was a genius.

Now, Mo Ling understood why Mo Qingyun advanced so quickly.

With the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul, he must find it hard to advance slowly.

As the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul absorbed Mo Ling’s flames, Mo Qingyun didn’t let it absorb too much to avoid harming her foundation.

Mo Ling’s condition improved as the flames were suppressed.

After a while, Mo Qingyun stopped the absorption.

"Thank you, Qingyun!" Mo Ling smiled gratefully.

"You’re welcome," Mo Qingyun chuckled. "To fully solve your constitution, we need a suitable cultivation technique; I don’t have one."

"Can I cultivate?" Mo Ling asked excitedly.

She had never heard this before. The doctors usually said to eat and play as much as possible, but Mo Qingyun gave her hope.

"Of course!" Mo Qingyun said. "With a suitable technique, your cultivation would advance rapidly."

"Really?" Mo Ling was excited but then disappointed. "Such techniques are rare."

"I’ll find one for you," Mo Qingyun said determinedly.

"Alright, but if you don’t, I’ll hold you accountable," Mo Ling laughed. "Tell me about your martial souls."

"My martial souls?"

Mo Qingyun thought for a moment. "I have twin martial souls; I just discovered them recently..."

He explained his discovery to Mo Ling.

"Is that so? No wonder your cultivation didn’t advance quickly before," Mo Ling nodded, understanding.

Mo Qingyun asked her to keep it a secret.

"Little rascal, so mysterious!" Mo Ling said with a playful glance. "But since you helped me suppress the flames, I’ll keep it secret."

Outside,

Mo Xiao and Mo Feilin arrived. Seeing Mo Xin, Mo Feilin asked, "How is Ling?"

"Not sure," Mo Xin said. "Qingyun said he can help suppress the flames; I’m guarding outside."

"Qingyun has a way?" Mo Feilin and Mo Xiao were surprised.

"We’ll wait outside," Mo Feilin said, relaxing slightly.

...

Chapter 76: Advancing to True Energy Realm

The door creaked open, and Mo Qingyun and Mo Ling emerged.

"Are you alright?" Mo Feilin asked in surprise.

Mo Ling nodded with a smile.

"Great," they all sighed in relief.

"You’re quite the talent, Qingyun," Mo Xin said with a smile. "Tell us how you suppressed Ling’s flames."

Mo Qingyun briefly explained, attributing it to Du Luo’s guidance.

"Du Luo must have taught you a lot," Mo Feilin said, smiling.

After chatting, Mo Feilin left for Qingmu Trading.

Mo Qingyun returned to his residence and began cultivation.

Some of the flames absorbed by the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul had transferred to him, so he needed to refine them quickly.

As he refined the flames, his cultivation surged.

A few days later, Mo Qingyun broke through to Half-True Energy Realm.

"Half-True Energy Realm!"

He was excited. "Now I can advance to True Energy Realm."

Taking out the Medicinal Essence Spirit, he began refining it.

Two days later, its size halved.

Mo Qingyun’s true energy reached a peak, almost bursting out.

He stopped refining and began condensing his true energy.
