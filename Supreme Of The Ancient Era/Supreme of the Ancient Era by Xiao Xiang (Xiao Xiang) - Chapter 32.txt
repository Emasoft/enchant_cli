In this confrontation, ripples like water waves appeared around Mo Qingyun's body.

"Hmm, that boy seems to have comprehended a very mysterious force."

After noticing Mo Qingyun's movements, the people from Liuming Valley and the three parties all turned pale with worry.

They were concerned that Mo Qingyun, after comprehending this force, would use it against them later.

"What should we do now?"

For a moment, the three parties looked at each other, unsure of what to do.

Should they approach Mo Qingyun and attack him?

But if they got close, would he use the Rain Seal Needle to shoot at them?

If they didn't attack him and let him continue comprehending, what if he succeeded and turned to deal with them?

At this moment, the three parties were in a dilemma, feeling quite troubled.

Just as everyone was worried, an astonishing surge of essence energy emanated from their surroundings.

Someone's cultivation was about to break through!

Upon noticing this, everyone's expressions changed as they looked towards the source of the essence energy.

Lu Yang was about to break through!

"Brother Lu Yang, good job."

Feeling the fluctuation in Lu Yang's aura, everyone from Xinghe Sect was delighted and excited.

If Lu Yang broke through to the True Essence realm, it would make dealing with Mo Qingyun much easier.

Compared to Xinghe Sect's excitement, the people from Liuming Valley and Zhou Family felt somewhat complicated.

Although Xinghe Sect was now allied with them, Lu Yang's breakthrough to the True Essence realm would be a great help in dealing with Mo Qingyun.

But they were also worried that once Lu Yang broke through, he might turn against them.

After all, Xinghe Sect and Zhou Family were rival factions; it was quite normal for Xinghe Sect to turn against Zhou Family.

At this moment, as the three parties were scheming, Lu Yang's aura suddenly surged.

Lu Yang had broken through; his cultivation successfully advanced to the True Essence realm.

After breaking through, Lu Yang's face was filled with joy as he opened his eyes and coldly said to Mo Qingyun, "Boy, now that my cultivation has entered the True Essence realm, you're ready to die."

With these words, Lu Yang took a step forward and approached Mo Qingyun.

Chapter 118: Comprehending the Essence of Earth

Mo Qingyun had noticed Lu Yang's approach but was in a critical moment and couldn't stop.

Seeing that Mo Qingyun didn't notice his approach, Lu Yang's cold smile grew even more sinister.

Not in a hurry to attack Mo Qingyun, he slowly approached him.

"Boy, you have quite the nerve. You dare to cultivate so intensely in front of us."

Lu Yang sneered, looking at Mo Qingyun as if he were a dead man.

In his view, Mo Qingyun's actions at this moment were like seeking death.

However, when Lu Yang was about ten meters away from Mo Qingyun, his smile froze instantly.

He felt a terrifying force descend upon him, pressing down powerfully.

Bang!

Facing this terrifying pressure, Lu Yang was directly pressed to his knees, his face turning pale.

"How... could this happen?"

This sudden change shocked Lu Yang, making him look somewhat panicked.

"What's going on? Why did Brother Lu Yang suddenly fall?"

"Brother Lu Yang, is he alright? Why did he suddenly fall?"

"Could that boy have done something to Brother Lu Yang, but he was always in cultivation."

...

Seeing Lu Yang's actions, the others around him all looked puzzled.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun, who was in cultivation, opened his eyes.

"The essence of earth is complete."

Feeling the sudden easing of gravity around him, Mo Qingyun looked at Lu Yang with a delighted smile.

Seeing Mo Qingyun's faint smile, the others felt an involuntary shiver in their hearts, a sense of unease rising.

"Do you want to move against me?"

Mo Qingyun looked at Lu Yang with a playful expression, his eyes flashing coldly. "After entering the Furnace Heaven Sect's ruins, what you did to me should be settled now."

Lu Yang slowly stood up and snorted disdainfully, "Hmph! Boy, last time you got lucky to escape. This time, I won't give you another chance."

Although he said this, Lu Yang's face was still serious as he summoned his martial soul.

Ice Bear Thunder!

The tenth-level peak martial soul, Ice Bear Thunder, was summoned and immediately emitted a shocking coldness.

Under this coldness, the flames within the Furnace Heaven Tower weakened considerably.

"Boy, now I'll let you see the difference between the True Essence realm and the True Qi realm."

Lu Yang's face turned cold as he moved, raising his hand to strike Mo Qingyun.

Ice Bear Frenzy

Lu Yang clenched both fists tightly, like a mountain pressing down, raising his hand to strike Mo Qingyun.

Under Lu Yang's punch, an astonishing coldness formed a bear shadow around him.

At this moment, Lu Yang was like a frenzied snow bear, hammering down on Mo Qingyun as if he wanted to smash him.

Darting Shadow Step

Facing Lu Yang's attack, Mo Qingyun didn't directly resist but quickly retreated, dodging his strike.

Bang!

After Mo Qingyun evaded, Lu Yang's punch landed on the ground, causing a tremor and loud sound.

Gravity Suppression!

After evading Lu Yang's strike, Mo Qingyun no longer held back and directly unleashed the essence of earth.

With the essence of earth, Lu Yang staggered, feeling a powerful gravity pressing on him.

Seeing this, Lu Yang was alarmed and looked at Mo Qingyun in fear.

This is the essence of earth; Mo Qingyun actually comprehended it!

So, did he suffer that gravity suppression from Mo Qingyun?

"You... you comprehended the essence of earth!"

Lu Yang's face was filled with shock as he stared at Mo Qingyun, like he was looking at a monster.

He couldn't accept that Mo Qingyun, with only True Qi realm cultivation, had comprehended two essences.

Moreover, Mo Qingyun's comprehension of the essence of earth was clearly after entering the fourth floor of the Furnace Heaven Tower.

In just over ten days, Mo Qingyun successfully comprehended it; this was a huge blow to him.

At this moment, the joy of his breakthrough to True Essence realm vanished instantly.

Compared to Mo Qingyun's comprehension of the essence of earth, his breakthrough was insignificant.

"What! That boy comprehended the essence of earth; how is this possible!"

"That boy comprehended the essence of earth, and now his gravity suppression will be reduced; what should we do?"

"Yes, with the reduction in gravity, he can fully utilize his strength. We're in trouble."

"Then what are we waiting for? Let's escape quickly, or he'll deal with us after handling Lu Yang."

"Run, run!"

...

For a moment, the others around him panicked and fled from the fourth floor, no longer caring about Lu Yang's fate.

"You... all of you..."

Seeing their actions, Lu Yang was furious, his face turning extremely grim.

Lu Yang didn't expect them to suddenly flee and leave him behind.

But for Lu Yang's anger, the others fleeing chose to ignore it.

Compared to their lives, Lu Yang's fate was irrelevant; without him holding Mo Qingyun back, how could they escape?

"Now, do you feel the taste of betrayal?" Seeing their actions, Mo Qingyun looked at Lu Yang mockingly.

Hearing this, Lu Yang gritted his teeth and coldly said, "Boy, don't gloat. Even if you comprehended the essence of earth, it's useless against me; the gap in realm is insurmountable."

"Is that so?"

Mo Qingyun smiled indifferently, "Unfortunately, the gap in realm you mentioned is useless against me."

Seal Door, seal him!

Mo Qingyun pointed at Lu Yang and cast his martial soul technique.

A miniature light door, like a meteor, directly struck Lu Yang's body.

After being hit by the Seal Door, the essence energy in Lu Yang's body was suppressed, and his newly broken True Essence realm cultivation was pushed back to the True Qi realm.

"How... could this happen!"

Feeling his cultivation revert to the True Qi realm, Lu Yang was alarmed.

At this moment, he finally felt fear.

Then, with a look of terror, Lu Yang pleaded to Mo Qingyun, "Brother Mo... I was wrong. Everything is my fault. Please spare me for the sake of Elder Wu and give me a chance to redeem myself."

Lu Yang knew clearly that without True Essence realm cultivation, he was no match for Mo Qingyun.

Feeling his cultivation drop to the ninth level of True Qi realm, he felt it difficult even to walk.

How could he face Mo Qingyun standing there as a target?

"Elder Wu?"

Mo Qingyun smiled playfully, "Is Elder Wu very close to me? Why should I spare him. Also, did you know a disciple of Xinghe Sect named Luo Yu whom I killed?"

"Luo... Luo Yu, you... you killed my second brother."

Hearing this, Lu Yang's face changed, his tone becoming unnatural.

"Originally he was your second brother; no wonder you're both shameless."

Hearing this, Mo Qingyun looked at him disdainfully and coldly said, "Since that's the case, you should die."

Gravity Suppression!

After Mo Qingyun spoke, he struck Lu Yang without waiting for him to respond.

Furnace Sun Severing Mountain Blade

Mo Qingyun took out his Fire Silk Saber and slashed at Lu Yang powerfully.

A five-meter-long blade of flames instantly formed on the Fire Silk Saber, slicing towards Lu Yang.

"Boy, when I kill you, Xinghe Sect won't let you off easily. You'll die a miserable death!"

Under Mo Qingyun's gravity suppression, Lu Yang couldn't resist and was slashed by the blade of flames.

"They ran quite fast!"

After killing Lu Yang, Mo Qingyun looked at the empty fourth floor with a faint smile.

However, he didn't pursue Zhou Tao and others; in his view, they were just small fry.

Then Mo Qingyun turned to explore the rooms inside the fourth floor.

Chapter 119: Re-Comprehending the Essence of Fire (Second Update)

The interior space of the fourth floor was smaller than the third, with only four rooms.

Soon, Mo Qingyun entered the first room.

The first room was very simple, with only a stone bed and some gray crystals on it.

Seeing these gray crystals, Mo Qingyun's expression changed to one of surprise.

"Soul... Soul Crystal!"

At this moment, even Mo Qingyun's calm heart raced.

Soul Crystals were precious; after refining them, they could purify the soul and enhance its power.

Such treasures were very valuable even in Mo Qingyun's previous life.

Refining these Soul Crystals, Mo Qingyun was confident his soul cultivation would reach the peak of the Formless realm or even the Spirit Essence realm.

His strength would also greatly increase as a result.

Without hesitation, Mo Qingyun put the Soul Crystals in his乾坤bag (Heavenly Bag).

After putting away the Soul Crystals, Mo Qingyun left the first room and entered the second.

The second room was much larger than the first, with a huge stove and some ore and half-finished weapons beside it.

"This should be a forging room!"

Looking at the layout of the second room, Mo Qingyun frowned and thought.

Then he quickly scanned the room.

Among the books beside the stove were titles like "Introduction to Forging," "Comprehensive Guide to Forging," and "True Insights into Forging."

"From these books, it seems that the Furnace Heaven Sect was once a forging sect."

After briefly scanning through these books, Mo Qingyun thought that some of his family's younger members who weren't suitable for alchemy could try forging.

With this thought, Mo Qingyun put the books in his Heavenly Bag.

Next, he continued searching the room but found nothing valuable and moved to the third room.

The third room was similar in layout to the first, with a small space and only a stone bed.

Unfortunately, there were no Soul Crystals in the third room; it was empty.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun felt a bit disappointed and entered the fourth room.

Upon entering, his face lit up with excitement.

On the shelves in the fourth room were piles of red crystals emitting intense flames.

"Fire Essence Crystals!"

Mo Qingyun's face was filled with joy; refining these essence crystals would help him quickly comprehend the essence of fire.

If he comprehended it, his strength would greatly increase again.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun became even more eager for the fifth floor of the Furnace Heaven Tower.

After quickly collecting the Fire Essence Crystals, he headed for the fifth floor.

Upon reaching the fifth floor, Mo Qingyun felt a powerful gravity suppression and flames burning on his body.

Even with his martial soul activated, the flames still burned him.

"It's not good; the flames on the fifth floor are too strong. I can't withstand them."

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun retreated to the fourth floor.

After retreating, he thought that to enter the fifth floor, he must comprehend the essence of fire.

Otherwise, his current strength couldn't withstand the flames there.

As for the gravity suppression on the fifth floor, he didn't mind it much since he wouldn't be fighting there.

With this thought, Mo Qingyun quickly took out an essence crystal and began refining it.

Mo Qingyun had the deepest understanding of fire essence in his previous life, so with these crystals' help, he comprehended the essence of fire at an unprecedented speed.

After a day, Mo Qingyun refined one Fire Essence Crystal completely.

Refining the essence power from the crystal, his understanding of the essence of fire deepened further.

Seeing this progress, Mo Qingyun continued refining another crystal without stopping.

Five days passed like this.

At this moment, a flame storm surrounded Mo Qingyun's body.

If Zhou Tao and others saw this scene, they would be terrified.

In just six days, Mo Qingyun comprehended another essence power and successfully grasped the essence of fire.

This comprehension speed was terrifying.

"Flame!"

Mo Qingyun closed his eyes and shouted, then the flame storm around him formed a wall of flames.

"First level comprehension of the essence of fire, successfully grasped."

After forming the wall of flames, Mo Qingyun opened his eyes with a look of joy.

"Now that I've comprehended the essence of fire, it's time to go to the fifth floor."

After successfully comprehending the essence of fire, Mo Qingyun headed for the fifth floor.

Soon, he returned to the fifth floor. This time, the flames there were much weaker.

Without the harm from the flames, Mo Qingyun easily entered and explored the fifth floor.

After observing for a while, he found that the fifth floor was the top of the Furnace Heaven Tower.

It had a large hall with several statues inside, each with inscriptions describing their identities.

Furnace Heaven Ancestor, the founder of Furnace Heaven Sect...

Furnace Heaven Elder, the most talented person in Furnace Heaven Sect's history, reaching the Spirit Formation realm at a hundred years old...

Furnace Heaven Ancestor, the most talented forger in Furnace Heaven Sect's history, once creating a low-grade spirit treasure alone...

After reading the inscriptions beside the statues, Mo Qingyun knew their identities.

Below the statues were several cushions; to his surprise, a skeleton sat on the central cushion.

Seeing this skeleton, Mo Qingyun's expression changed as he released his soul power to sense it.

Confirming that the skeleton was dead, Mo Qingyun relaxed and approached it slowly.

He worried that like Chilian, the skeleton might still have a soul.

Upon reaching the skeleton, Mo Qingyun noticed an ancient scroll on its body.

Furnace Sun Severing Mountain Blade: Heaven Rank Middle Stage martial technique, summoning furnace sun energy to slash through mountains and rivers...

Reading the title on the scroll, Mo Qingyun was surprised.

"Who would have thought that a complete version of Furnace Sun Severing Mountain Blade is here on the top floor. It's not easy to obtain."

Looking at the martial technique in his hand, Mo Qingyun sighed.

"Hmm, what's this..."

As he examined the martial technique, a strange aura from within the skeleton caught his attention.

Examining it closely, Mo Qingyun's expression changed to one of joy.

Chapter 120: Refining the Spirit Formation Realm (Third Update)

He saw a miniature palace in the skeleton's dantian.

The aura he sensed earlier was coming from this palace.

"Spirit Formation Palace!"

Seeing the miniature palace, Mo Qingyun's expression was filled with excitement.

He couldn't believe he would find such a treasure here.

A Spirit Formation Palace is the foundation of a Spirit Formation realm powerhouse, containing terrifying power.

"Judging from his aura, this person's cultivation should have reached the fourth level of Spirit Formation realm."

Mo Qingyun took out the Spirit Formation Palace and guessed its former owner's cultivation level.

"If I refine this Spirit Formation Palace, I'll have self-defense power in Lianyun City."

With this thought, Mo Qingyun began refining the Spirit Formation Palace without hesitation.

Refining a Spirit Formation Palace is extremely difficult, but if successful, the rewards are immense.

He could use it to refine his dantian and as a life-saving trump card when needed.

Over the next few days, Mo Qingyun spent his time refining the Spirit Formation Palace.

Three days passed quickly.

After three days of refinement, Mo Qingyun refined one-tenth of the Spirit Formation Palace, making him delighted.

At this rate, he could refine it completely within a month.

As he refined the Spirit Formation Palace, his aura also grew stronger.

Ten days later, Mo Qingyun successfully refined four-tenths of the Spirit Formation Palace, slightly faster than expected.

His cultivation reached the peak of the seventh level True Qi realm and was close to the eighth level.

Twenty days later, his aura suddenly surged, becoming much stronger.

He had broken through to the eighth level True Qi realm.

Twenty-five days later, Mo Qingyun slowly opened his eyes with an excited expression.

After twenty-five days of continuous refinement, he had completely refined the Spirit Formation Palace.

His cultivation was now firmly at the eighth level True Qi realm, reaching its peak.

"It's time to leave."

After refining the Spirit Formation Palace completely, Mo Qingyun stored it in his dantian and used its essence energy to refine his own.

From now on, Mo Qingyun's dantian would be constantly refined by the Spirit Formation Palace's essence energy.

"Hmm? Why is there a fluctuation in Light Door martial soul's aura?"

As he prepared to leave, Mo Qingyun sensed a fluctuation in the Light Door martial soul.

He summoned it and examined it closely.

A light door, like from ancient times, appeared before him.

To his surprise, the Light Door martial soul was gathering aura to form another miniature light door.

"Light Door martial soul, what's this?"

Seeing the change in his Light Door martial soul, Mo Qingyun was puzzled.

After a moment, the aura fluctuation in the Light Door martial soul stopped.

Now it contained another miniature light door.

This new light door emitted swirling光芒, radiating a teleportation force.

Seeing this second miniature light door, Mo Qingyun was excited and exclaimed, "This... is the Light Door martial soul's second martial soul technique? It has two!"

According to Mo Qingyun, he had never heard of a martial soul having two martial soul techniques.

Discovering this, the Light Door martial soul became even more mysterious to him.

"This Light Door martial soul is what level? It has two martial soul techniques!"

Mo Qingyun was shocked, then he activated the second martial soul technique.

A swirling light door appeared before him, similar to a teleportation portal.

"Is the Light Door martial soul's second martial soul technique teleportation?"

Looking at the swirling light door, Mo Qingyun was puzzled and stepped into it.

Whoosh!

Suddenly, his surroundings blurred, and he appeared at the center of the Furnace Heaven Sect ruins.

"It's really teleportation!"

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun was shocked and excited.

Teleportation is more powerful than instant movement, which only Supreme realm powerhouses can do.

So now he had a power surpassing the Supreme realm!

"Earlier, when I stepped into the teleportation portal, I thought of the center of the Furnace Heaven Sect ruins. Then I appeared here."

Recalling this, Mo Qingyun thought, "Could it be that the teleportation portal's destination is determined by my thoughts?"

With this thought, he began testing it.

After some tests, Mo Qingyun confirmed his theory: the teleportation portal's destination is determined by his thoughts.

Additionally, he learned that the farther the distance of teleportation, the more aura the martial soul consumes.

So there is a limit to its range.

Despite this, the second martial soul technique was very helpful for Mo Qingyun.

He thought that if he encountered danger in the future, he could use it to escape.

Thinking this, Mo Qingyun sighed and thought, "If I had this ability in my previous life, I wouldn't have been killed by Li He and others."

"Since the second martial soul technique is teleportation, let's call it Teleportation Door."

Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and named the second martial soul technique.

After calming down, he headed towards the exit of the Furnace Heaven Sect ruins.

"I wonder how Chilian and Moon Shadow are doing?"

On his way to the exit, Mo Qingyun was concerned about Chilian and Moon Shadow's safety.

After all, in the Furnace Heaven Sect ruins, he killed many young members of Xinghe Sect, Zhou Family, and Liuming Valley.

When these young members reported to their elders, the three factions would definitely seek revenge on Chilian and Moon Shadow.

As Mo Qingyun was about to exit the Furnace Heaven Sect ruins, he received a soul transmission from Chilian.

Chilian told Mo Qingyun that he and Moon Shadow were no longer outside the Furnace Heaven Sect ruins.

After the young members of the three factions reported what happened inside, they attacked Chilian and Moon Shadow.

Chilian then led Moon Shadow out of the battle to a secluded place near the Furnace Heaven Sect.

Teleportation Door, appear!

Knowing Chilian's location, Mo Qingyun didn't hesitate and activated the Teleportation Door to teleport there.

Whoosh!

Mo Qingyun's figure flashed, and he appeared in a secluded forest.

"Master... Master!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun appear suddenly, Chilian and Moon Shadow were shocked and froze.

Instant Movement!

To them, Mo Qingyun's sudden appearance was like instant movement.

Mo Qingyun had used instant movement to appear here!

Only Supreme realm powerhouses can use instant movement, and Mo Qingyun was only at the True Qi realm. This was incredible.

If they knew that his Teleportation Door is even more powerful than instant movement, they would be stunned.

"Master, did you... master instant movement?"

Even Chilian's calm mind was shaken by this.

"It's not instant movement, just a similar technique I mastered."

Mo Qingyun explained simply without detailing the Teleportation Door.

After all, knowing about this powerful martial soul technique was better for fewer people.

Chapter 121: Returning to Jade Mansion (Fourth Update)

"Hmm! Master, there seems to be a subtle aura fluctuation in your body."

Feeling the subtle aura fluctuation, Chilian frowned and looked at Mo Qingyun curiously.

"Oh?"

Hearing this, Mo Qingyun was surprised by Chilian's perception.

Thinking about Chilian's previous life as a Divine Realm powerhouse, it was normal for him to sense the aura of Mo Qingyun's Spirit Formation Palace.

"To avoid unnecessary trouble, I need to hide the aura of my Spirit Formation Palace."

Mo Qingyun thought and used his martial soul technique Seal Door to seal the aura of his Spirit Formation Palace.

"Hmm, that subtle aura is gone."

As Mo Qingyun sealed the aura of his Spirit Formation Palace, Chilian's frown deepened and muttered.

Seeing Chilian's expression, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly without explaining further.

After sealing the aura of his Spirit Formation Palace, Mo Qingyun sensed a change in Chilian and Moon Shadow's auras.

"Did you both break through?"

Mo Qingyun was surprised as he looked at them.

Chilian's aura now indicated a third-level Spirit Formation realm, while Moon Shadow's surpassed the half-step Spirit Formation realm and reached the full Spirit Formation realm.

"Yes, during this time, our cultivation has improved."

Chilian smiled and explained. "When those three factions chased us, I killed a third-level Spirit Formation realm powerhouse and several first-level ones. After refining their blood essence, we both broke through."

Chilian's face was filled with joy at this achievement.

Seeing Chilian break through, Mo Qingyun looked serious and asked, "How strong are you now?"

Chilian replied with pride, "I can fight a fifth-level Spirit Formation realm powerhouse!"

"Good, let's head to Lianyun City."

Hearing Chilian's answer, Mo Qingyun nodded and walked forward.

It had been almost two months since he left Lianyun City, so it was time to return.

Moreover, with Chilian's current cultivation, he no longer needed to worry about the Xue Family and could settle accounts with them.

On their way back, Mo Qingyun took out the Soul Crystals and began refining them.

"Chilian, here are some Soul Crystals. Refine them."

While Mo Qingyun refined the Soul Crystals, he gave some to Chilian.

He did this because a stronger soul would allow Chilian to control more and stronger blood slaves.

Compared to these Soul Crystals, giving them to Chilian now would be more beneficial.

"Soul... Soul Crystal!"
