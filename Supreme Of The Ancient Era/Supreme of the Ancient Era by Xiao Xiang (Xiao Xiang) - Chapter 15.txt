The crowd in the arena could not help but exclaim.

"Who would have thought Mo Cang awakened his martial soul technique? It seems the result of this competition is already out."

Seeing this, Mo Hongtian revealed a hint of regret and sighed inwardly.

Earlier, seeing Mo Qingyun's performance had made him subconsciously hope for his victory. But now, that hope vanished after Mo Cang displayed his martial soul technique.

"Being able to force Mo Cang to this extent and use the Shadow Tiger martial soul's technique, Qingyun can be considered a worthy opponent."

Mo Feipeng sighed and clenched his fists, somewhat reluctantly saying.

In his view, this was an unfair competition. Mo Qingyun had done well to reach this point.

At that moment, Mo Ling and Mo Yue Ru also shared the same thoughts as Mo Feipeng.

But then Mo Xiao's eyes lit up, revealing a delighted and cunning smile. He thought to himself: "Right, I forgot Qingyun hasn't summoned his martial soul yet. If he does, Mo Cang surely won’t be his match."

Mo Xiao had a deep impression of Mo Qingyun's powerful martial soul, far surpassing the Shadow Tiger.

"Mo Qingyun, you actually forced my elder brother to use his martial soul technique. This... how is this possible?"

Mo Hai's face turned pale, knowing Mo Cang’s strength well. He couldn’t believe that Mo Qingyun could push him to this point.

In the first arena,

"Martial soul technique!"

Seeing the rapidly approaching gaze, Mo Qingyun's expression tightened, showing a hint of surprise.

"Buzz!"

Then he felt his head buzz and his consciousness became somewhat hazy, as if struck by a hammer.

"Soul damage martial soul technique!"

Discovering this, Mo Qingyun was once again startled. This type of martial soul technique was quite rare.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun couldn’t help but admire Mo Cang's talent. At least among the younger generation in his family, he was quite impressive.

If a common young member were hit by this martial soul technique, they would likely lose their combat ability.

However, for Mo Qingyun, this level of soul attack was not enough. Don’t forget that in his previous life he was a Supreme Realm powerhouse, the youngest Alchemy Master on the Heavenly Soul Continent.

The key to becoming an alchemist was having a powerful soul. Mo Qingyun, as the youngest Alchemy Master on the Heavenly Soul Continent in his previous life, could be imagined how powerful his soul was.

Although he had reincarnated and his soul power weakened, it was still enough to handle Mo Cang's damage.

"Kneel?"

Mo Qingyun curled his lips, disdainfully smiling: "Mo Cang, do you think just by your eyes shining, people will submit?"

Eyes shining!

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, the surrounding people were all taken aback.

Brother, that was a martial soul technique!

What do you mean by eyes shining? You just don’t know what it is.

"You... you’re fine!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun unaffected after his martial soul technique hit him, Mo Cang was somewhat panicked.

He never thought that his strongest move would be ineffective against Mo Qingyun. What could he do next to fight him?

"Why should I have any problems? Just because your eyes shine?"

Mo Qingyun smiled savoringly and continued: "If you don’t have other means, then the battle should end."

Blood energy raging!

With that said, Mo Qingyun no longer held back and unleashed his martial soul technique.

Immediately, his aura surged, emitting terrifying blood energy fluctuations. Mo Qingyun’s blood energy was almost as powerful as some mighty beasts.

At the same time, his cultivation rapidly increased.

Body Refinement Ninth Stage Mid,

Body Refinement Ninth Stage Late,

Body Refinement Tenth Stage,

...

Body Refinement Tenth Stage Late Peak.

In no time, Mo Qingyun’s cultivation reached the peak of Body Refinement Tenth Stage, just half a step away from Mo Cang.

Shadow Step,

Ninth Level Collapse,

Fire Dragon Seal

At the same time, Mo Qingyun unleashed all three martial techniques, his figure moving towards Mo Cang.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun was fully unleashed, almost reaching the peak of his strength.

Soon, nine inner energy fist shadows condensed and accompanied by nine inner energy seals attacked Mo Cang from eighteen directions.

Mo Cang, already stunned, reacted a moment late. Seeing the attacks coming from eighteen directions, he was dumbfounded.

He was shocked by this scene!

How could Mo Qingyun be so powerful?

Bang bang bang...

Mo Cang was hit by the fist shadows and seals, flying away.

Puh!

After landing, Mo Cang spat out blood, looking at Mo Qingyun in a daze.

He lost to someone he had never taken seriously before. And this loss was complete, with no excuses.

Even if Mo Qingyun gave him an hour to recover his strength, the result was still a crushing defeat. From the start of the competition, he had been suppressed by Mo Qingyun and never gained an advantage.

This result was a huge blow to him.

"Winning!"

Seeing Mo Cang blasted away by Mo Qingyun, Mo Hongtian was initially stunned but then stood up with a look of joy and laughed: "Good, good, very good. Not bad for my grandson."

Even Mo Hongtian’s mind could not suppress his joy and excitement, clenching his fists. His body trembled with excitement as he stared at the slightly thin youth in the arena.

In Chapter 55: Next year, on Town Assembly Day, I will enter True Qi Realm

Silence! Utter silence!

In the arena now, everyone was in a daze, staring at the thin youth in the competition area.

They never imagined that the one who would win this family competition first place was this youth. Before, he was so inconspicuous.

But now, he had risen unexpectedly and shone brightly.

Perhaps this is what a dark horse looks like.

"He actually won..."

Mo Feipeng felt his head empty, slightly stunned before standing up excitedly with clenched fists. His body trembled with excitement as he had a thousand words to express.

Mo Qingyun’s performance was too surprising. Originally, he thought Mo Qingyun could get in the top thirty.

But now?

Mo Qingyun won first place! The first place among the younger generation!

Throughout this process, Mo Qingyun challenged his psychological endurance, bringing him surprise after surprise.

"Mother, Qingyun seems to have defeated Mo Cang and won first place!"

Mo Ling was in shock, speaking hurriedly as if she had won herself.

"Good, good child. You didn’t disappoint your third brother."

Mo Yue Ru was so happy she cried, smiling: "If Third Brother knew this, he would be very pleased."

"He really did it. He really did it."

Seeing Mo Qingyun win, Mo Xiao smiled sweetly.

But after a brief smile, she seemed to realize something and said in shock: "When Qingyun defeated Mo Cang, he didn’t summon his martial soul. Without it, he still beat Mo Cang. This..."

Thinking this, she became stunned, feeling her brain wasn’t enough.

"This naughty boy, hiding so deeply. I worried about him for a long time."

Mo Xin complained with a smile, also happy but somewhat frustrated. She had fought Mo Cang to the end and lost.

But now, Mo Qingyun defeated him strongly. So did this mean Mo Qingyun’s strength surpassed her?

This result made her sigh involuntarily, feeling a blow.

Not only Mo Xin was affected. Mo Yi and Mo Xun also looked frustrated and smiled bitterly.

"This guy is so strong, I thought I was only slightly weaker than him when we fought."

Mo Yi and Mo Xun shook their heads, smiling self-deprecatingly.

Compared to the joy of Mo Xin and others, some like Mo Cang were filled with resentment.

"Mo Hongtian has a good grandson."

He Qiansheng sighed, glancing at He Lingyu beside him with complex emotions.

Perhaps he regretted allowing her to break off the engagement. Such an excellent son-in-law was missed by their family.

"This... this isn’t true, how could he be so strong."

He Lingyu was in pain, rubbing her forehead unable to accept this.

The more outstanding Mo Qingyun’s performance, the more she felt regretful and remorseful.

"Even if you’re so strong, my elder brother will still defeat him."

Song Xiuyun was resentful but her tone lacked confidence.

It seemed she no longer had strong faith in Song Zihao defeating Mo Qingyun.

"This boy..."

Song Xu frowned, looking at Mo Qingyun with a deep expression: "Could it be that the Mo family deliberately hid him, allowing him to reveal his strength today? Otherwise, he wouldn’t rise so quickly."

At this moment, Song Xu was deep in thought.

But if one observed carefully, they could see a cold look in his eyes when he looked at Mo Qingyun.

Near the first arena,

Seeing Mo Qingyun defeat Mo Cang, Mo Hai’s face turned pale and he said in fear: "Elder Brother lost to Mo Qingyun..."

After saying this, he ran out of the arena in panic: "I need to tell Father and Grandfather."

Mo Qingyun didn’t pay attention to Mo Hai’s departure, looking at Mo Cang indifferently: "Mo Cang, you lost."

"Lost..."

Hearing this, Mo Cang’s eyes became blank again and he looked at Mo Qingyun.

After a brief daze, he looked at Mo Qingyun coldly: "Mo Qingyun, I admit that this time I miscalculated. Your growth exceeded my expectations. But next time we meet, the winner will be me."

Seeing Mo Cang recover quickly from his loss, Mo Qingyun was somewhat surprised.

But after hearing what he said, he smiled indifferently: "Losers always find excuses. It seems you’re no different. If you couldn’t win me this time, will you have a chance next? The gap between us will only be greater."

Mo Qingyun was confident that with his talent and experience, he would surpass Mo Cang. The gap between them would only widen.

"Greater gaps? Haha! It seems you’re blinded by your current victory."

Mo Cang sneered: "Don’t forget, your martial soul is just a Level One Lighting Soul. With your talent, you’ll stop at the Body Refinement Realm."

Mo Cang sneered again: "I have a Level Ten Shadow Tiger martial soul. Soon, I’ll enter the True Qi Realm and our gap will widen further."

"Are you still confident that you can be my opponent?"

"You’re just temporarily successful. In the end, I’ll be the one who laughs."

"Talent limited?"

Hearing Mo Cang’s words, Mo Qingyun looked at him disdainfully and shook his head: "Mo Cang, in these two months, you haven’t made any progress. Apart from boasting about your Shadow Tiger martial soul, what else do you have to boast?"

"Don’t forget, two months ago I was at Body Refinement Fourth Stage while you were at Ninth Stage. Now? I’m at Ninth Stage, and you’re just half a step to True Qi Realm."

"Is this your talent and cultivation speed?"

"And last month, you said I didn’t even have the qualifications to make you use your martial soul in the family competition. But now, I defeated you."

"I don’t know what qualifications you have to be proud in front of me. Today, I’ll tell you again: apart from your Shadow Tiger martial soul, you’re nothing."

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, everyone in the arena couldn’t help but change their expressions.

Mo Qingyun said that Mo Cang, with a Level Ten Shadow Tiger martial soul, was nothing.

Although everyone was shocked, they couldn’t refute Mo Qingyun’s words. It seemed true.

In front of Mo Qingyun, apart from his innate martial soul, Mo Cang couldn’t compare in other aspects.

Then Mo Qingyun said proudly: "You say I’ll stop at the Body Refinement Realm? Next year, on Town Assembly Day, my cultivation will reach True Qi Realm."

Next year, on Town Assembly Day, my cultivation will reach True Qi!

How confident was this statement!

It echoed in everyone’s minds like thunder.

After hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, everyone looked at him with different expressions. Although somewhat arrogant, there was more expectation.

They all wanted to see if Mo Qingyun could reach True Qi Realm as he said next year at the Town Assembly.

In Chapter 56: The Family Competition Ends (Final Chapter)

In a courtyard of the Mo family, a fifteen or sixteen-year-old youth rushed here in panic.

If Mo Qingyun were there, he would recognize this youth as the one who left the arena earlier, Mo Hai.

After arriving at the courtyard, Mo Hai hurriedly entered it. Inside were a middle-aged man and an elder.

Seeing Mo Hai’s urgent arrival, both showed surprise. The middle-aged man asked: "Xiaohai, what happened? Why are you so panicked?"

This middle-aged man was Mo Hai’s father, Mo Zhirong. The elder beside him was Mo Hai’s grandfather, the first elder of the Mo family, Mo Kuide, a True Essence Realm Eighth Stage powerhouse.

"Dad, Grandfather, Elder Brother..."

Mo Hai was panting from running fast and couldn’t finish his sentence.

Seeing Mo Hai mention Mo Cang, Mo Zhirong smiled faintly: "The family competition has ended? Even if Elder Brother won first place, you shouldn’t be so excited."

"No, it’s not like that."

Mo Hai hurriedly waved his hand: "Elder Brother didn’t win first place."

"What? Elder Brother didn’t win first place?"

Hearing this, Mo Zhirong and Mo Kuide were surprised.

After a brief surprise, Mo Kuide’s expression darkened: "I underestimated this granddaughter of mine. She actually defeated Cang."

"Perhaps Mo Xin’s cultivation has entered True Qi Realm, which is somewhat unexpected."

Mo Zhirong frowned and looked surprised.

In his view, Mo Xin could only defeat Mo Cang if she entered True Qi Realm.

Seeing Mo Zhirong’s misunderstanding, Mo Hai quickly explained: "Grandfather, Dad, it wasn’t Mo Xin who defeated Elder Brother. He was beaten by Mo Qingyun."

"Mo Qingyun?"

Mo Kuide, not familiar with Mo Qingyun, looked at Mo Zhirong in confusion.

"Dad, Mo Qingyun is the son of Mo Feiyu."

Mo Zhirong explained to Mo Kuide, then frowned: "I remember that in the last family competition’s monthly test, Mo Qingyun was only at Body Refinement Seventh Stage. How could he defeat Cang?"

"His son!"

Mo Kuide was surprised, then said seriously: "Xiaohai, tell us the entire process of the family competition."

"Yes, Grandfather!"

Mo Hai nodded and told Mo Kuide and Mo Zhirong the entire process of the competition.

After listening, both Mo Kuide and Mo Zhirong looked solemn and silent.

"Body Refinement Ninth Stage Initial Peak!"

After a moment, Mo Zhirong’s eyes turned cold: "He also knows a secret technique that can instantly increase cultivation. This Mo Qingyun has many secrets."

"If my guess is right, Mo Qingyun should have reached Body Refinement Ninth Stage long ago."

Mo Kuide was silent for a moment, then said: "Otherwise, even with such talent, he couldn’t have broken through two levels in a month."

"Dad, do you mean Mo Qingyun was hiding his cultivation?"

Mo Zhirong’s eyes lit up: "Right, I noticed Mo Qingyun seems to know a secret technique for hiding cultivation."

"At such an age with this mindset, Mo Qingyun is quite remarkable."

Mo Kuide sighed and said enviously: "That old ghost, Mo Hongtian, has a good grandson."

"Dad, should we deal with this Mo Qingyun?"

Mo Zhirong made a gesture of beheading.

"No!"

Mo Kuide interrupted: "This Mo Qingyun deceived all of us. With such patience, he’s now a formidable opponent."

Mo Kuide sighed again.

"What should we do then?" Mo Zhirong asked.

"We need to change our plan. You contact the other elders, I’ll discuss with them."

Mo Kuide looked deep and instructed Mo Zhirong.

...

In the arena,

After Mo Qingyun defeated Mo Cang and won first place, this family competition ended.

Next was the distribution of rewards based on rankings.

The rewards were good. The first place winner received five thousand gold coins and the opportunity to enter the Spirit Palace.

The second and third places also had good rewards, three thousand and two thousand gold coins respectively.

But when announcing the third place winner, everyone sighed. Mo Cang, who had a chance to win first place, ended up third after challenging Mo Qingyun.

Everyone in the arena sighed at this result, feeling that fate is unpredictable.

After distributing rewards to the top ten, elders encouraged and praised the younger generation.

Mo Qingyun, who won first place unexpectedly, was naturally the focus of attention. Elders encouraged and praised him.

After receiving encouragement from many elders, Mo Qingyun left the arena reluctantly. Before leaving, Mo Hongtian specially asked him to visit more often.

Mo Qingyun nodded, as he was the nominal grandson and had to give some face.

After leaving the arena, Mo Qingyun returned home and began meditating. He had gained a lot from this competition and needed to digest it.

A few days passed quickly.

Finally, the New Year’s Eve arrived. Seeing this, Mo Qingyun ended his meditation as there were many occasions he needed to attend.

So it wasn’t suitable for him to continue meditating now. But after a few days of meditation, Mo Qingyun’s cultivation had improved.

From Body Refinement Ninth Stage Initial Peak to Body Refinement Ninth Stage Mid Peak, and his realm was very stable.

When Mo Qingyun stopped meditating, Mo Xin and the others arrived.

"Mo Xin, Mo Ling, Xiaoqiao, you’re here."

Seeing them, Mo Qingyun smiled and greeted.

But to his surprise, the three girls didn’t respond directly. Instead, they threw a pile of letters in front of him.

"What are these?"

Mo Qingyun looked at the letters with confusion and asked.

"Open them yourself," Mo Xiao said slyly.

Hearing this, Mo Ling and the others smiled mischievously at him.

Under their gaze, Mo Qingyun opened the letters carefully.

After reading them, he was stunned. The contents were girls expressing their admiration for him.

In other words, these letters were all love letters.

"This..." Mo Qingyun was speechless. A few hundred-year-old monster in his previous life, now receiving love letters from young girls made him feel overwhelmed.

This world was crazy.

"Ha ha!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s expression, the three girls laughed and looked at him with amusement.

After a moment, Mo Xin broke the silence: "The first among our family’s younger generation, are you afraid of a few love letters?"

Hearing this, Mo Qingyun was speechless again and smiled bitterly: "Mo Xin, stop teasing me."

Seeing his expression, the girls laughed again. Then Mo Ling changed the topic: "Let’s not talk about letters. Uncle asked us to call you, saying he has something to discuss with you. Grandfather is there too."

"Grandfather is there?"

Mo Qingyun was surprised and said in amazement.

Then he didn’t hesitate, going with the three girls to Mo Feipeng’s residence. He felt that since Grandfather was involved, it wouldn’t be simple.

In Chapter 57: Let Mo Cang Enter the Spirit Palace

Soon, Mo Qingyun and the others arrived at Mo Feipeng’s residence. Inside were Mo Yue Ru, Mo Hongtian, and others. Mo Feilin had returned from Lianyun City.

"Grandfather, Uncle, Auntie, Fourth Uncle."

Mo Qingyun greeted Mo Hongtian and others.

"Qingyun is here, come over and sit."

Seeing him, Mo Hongtian smiled with satisfaction and gestured to a stone bench.

"Okay."

Then they sat down beside the others.

"Qingyun, there might be some changes regarding your entry into the Spirit Palace."

Mo Hongtian sighed and said to Mo Qingyun.

Hearing this, Mo Qingyun frowned and his expression changed. But he didn’t speak immediately, waiting for Mo Hongtian to finish.

After a moment, Mo Hongtian continued: "Recently, First Elder Mo Kuide and other elders proposed a suggestion to cancel your entry into the Spirit Palace and let Mo Cang enter for cultivation."

"Let Mo Cang enter the Spirit Palace?"

Hearing this, Mo Qingyun’s expression changed and he was surprised. But after a moment, he calmed down.

Given Mo Cang’s talent, it was understandable for the elders to want him in the Spirit Palace. But Mo Qingyun still felt annoyed.

He won first place, why should someone else get the entry?

Just because Mo Cang’s talent is higher?

If so, why have a competition for the first place to enter the Spirit Palace?

Just name who can enter directly.

After giving hope, then taking it away, what’s the difference from playing with people?

After a moment, Mo Qingyun looked at Mo Hongtian unhappily and asked: "Did you agree?"

"Sigh! As a grandfather, I naturally hope you can enter the Spirit Palace,"

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s change in attitude, Mo Hongtian sighed again and continued: "But as the family head, I often can’t control my decisions. In our family, if three elders oppose the family head’s decision, it needs to be voted on by the elders."

"This time, Mo Kuide and five other elders opposed your entry into the Spirit Palace. I couldn’t do much, hope you can understand. But I negotiated some compensation for you, take this third-grade high-level medicinal pill."

"Third-grade high-level medicinal pill?"

Mo Qingyun smiled sarcastically: "Grandfather, your efforts for me are appreciated. But this third-grade high-level medicinal pill you can keep. I can’t accept a slap and a sweet bun."

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s reaction, everyone was taken aback, not knowing what to say. After all, anyone would feel annoyed in such a situation.

Then Mo Qingyun said: "Grandfather, please convey to Mo Kuide and others that even without entering the Spirit Palace, next year on Town Assembly Day, I will enter True Qi Realm and step on Mo Cang."

Saying this, he looked confident with a heroic aura.

Seeing his performance, everyone was surprised and looked at him in admiration.

"Good, good, not bad for my grandson, with pride and spirit."

After a moment of surprise, Mo Hongtian praised him, looking at him with satisfaction and approval.

"You can be assured that I will convey this to them."

"Since there’s nothing else, Grandfather, Uncle..."

Mo Qingyun looked at everyone and said: "I’ll go back now."

After saying this, he left the courtyard without waiting for a response.

"Qingyun, I’ll go with you."

Seeing this, Mo Xiao stood up and ran after him.

Mo Qingyun looked at her and nodded hesitantly. Then they left the courtyard together, returning to his residence.

Seeing Mo Qingyun leave, everyone looked at each other in surprise, not knowing what to say.

After a moment, Mo Feipeng smiled helplessly: "This naughty boy is just like his father, stubborn and strong-willed."

"I think it’s good. I find Qingyun very likable, much more than those two brats from Mo Zhirong’s family."

Mo Feilin smiled indifferently and gave his opinion.

"Fourth Brother, Qingyun’s and Mo Xin’s temperaments were spoiled by you."

Mo Yue Ru looked at Mo Feilin with a reproachful look, showing helplessness.

Mo Feilin was very fond of his children. Often, he cared for Mo Xin and the others more than Mo Feipeng.

"Children need to be taken care of. Can’t you be like Big Brother, always with a stern face."

Mo Feilin smiled lazily and winked at Mo Feipeng.

"Fourth Brother, you don’t understand. A strict father raises a filial son."

Mo Feipeng raised his head and responded.

"Ha ha!"

Seeing Mo Feipeng’s banter, everyone smiled helplessly.

...

In Mo Qingyun’s residence,

After leaving Mo Feipeng’s courtyard, he returned home with Mo Xiao.

"Why didn’t you tell Grandfather your martial soul is a Super Martial Soul?"

Mo Xiao finally asked: "If everyone knew, you would definitely enter the Spirit Palace for cultivation."

"But then what’s the difference between me and Mo Cang?"

Mo Qingyun asked back: "What would winning this competition mean then?"

"Hmm..."

Hearing this, Mo Xiao couldn’t refute him. If he won just because his martial soul was higher than Mo Cang’s, the meaning would change. There wouldn’t be much difference between them.

"But if you enter the Spirit Palace, your cultivation speed will increase a lot."

Mo Xiao said with regret.

"Not necessarily!"

Mo Qingyun smiled savoringly: "For others, the Spirit Palace might increase cultivation speed a lot. But for me, it’s not much different."

He believed that with enough resources and medicinal pills, his cultivation speed wouldn’t be slower than in the Spirit Palace.

"Really?"

Mo Xiao smiled: "Although it sounds like boasting, I’m still looking forward to it."

Sounds like boasting?

Mo Qingyun was speechless. Mo Xiao was too straightforward.

"Also, are you confident of reaching True Qi Realm next year on Town Assembly Day?"

Mo Xiao asked curiously.

"Did you tell them?" Mo Qingyun smiled savoringly.

"How would I know," Mo Xiao blushed, looking at him closely.

"I don’t know either!" Mo Qingyun shrugged.

Although he was confident his cultivation speed wouldn’t be slower than in the Spirit Palace,

he still felt uncertain about reaching True Qi Realm within such a short time. Rapid cultivation required abundant resources, which he didn’t have yet.

"You were so confident just now."

Mo Xiao rolled her eyes at him.

"Swelling face to look fat, you didn’t notice?"
