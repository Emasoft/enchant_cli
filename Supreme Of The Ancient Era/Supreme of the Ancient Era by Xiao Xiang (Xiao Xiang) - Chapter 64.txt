Seeing Red Powder recognize herself, Mo Qingyun did not intend to hide his identity and nodded in acknowledgment of who he was. Then, he said coolly to Red Powder and the others: "Now I give you a choice—submit to me or die. From now on, you have ten breaths to consider."

For these people, Mo Qingyun rarely wasted words and directly stated his intentions.

Upon hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Red Powder and the others immediately changed their expressions, a strong anger appearing on their faces.

Mo Qingyun’s current display was too arrogant.

However, considering Mo Qingyun's fearsome reputation, Red Powder and the others did not dare to directly attack him for a moment.

Then, Red Powder and the others frowned, pondering hesitantly in their hearts.

Ten breaths passed swiftly.

Seeing that the time was up, Mo Qingyun looked at Red Powder and the others with a cold expression and said indifferently: "Time is up. Have you made your decision?"

At this moment, Red Powder’s companion, a True Essence Realm Fifth Level cultivator, said disdainfully: "Purple-Eyed Demon Lord, although your reputation is fearsome, for us to submit to you and be in the company of a madman like you is absolutely impossible. If you have the ability, then kill me."

With the weight of a mountain!

As soon as Iron Cold Mountain finished speaking, he held his giant hammer and smashed towards Mo Qingyun, seemingly ready to die with him.

"Since you seek death, I will fulfill your wish."

Seeing Iron Cold Mountain attacking him, Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened and he struck back powerfully.

Tong Power Ray!

At this moment, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and directly emitted a Tong Power Ray.

Puchi!

The Tong Power Ray pierced through Iron Cold Mountain’s head instantly, killing him on the spot.

Now, Mo Qingyun’s intention was to kill a chicken to warn the monkeys and intimidate Red Powder and the others.

One move! A True Essence Realm Fifth Level cultivator, dead!

Seeing this scene, the surrounding people all sucked in a breath of cold air. The awe in their eyes towards Mo Qingyun intensified.

"I will submit to you!"

After a brief moment of contemplation, Red Powder bit her lip and made a difficult decision.

From Mo Qingyun’s decisive actions just now, Red Powder knew in her heart that Mo Qingyun would not use any means against her because of her appearance.

If she did not agree, the outcome might be similar to Iron Cold Mountain’s—her life would end.

"Very well. You will understand that your decision is wise."

Seeing Red Powder’s willingness to submit, Mo Qingyun nodded in satisfaction and looked at the others beside her coldly: "What about you?"

Chapter 230: Controlling Red Powder City (Second Update)

"I... We will also submit!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s inquiry, the few people beside him immediately changed their expressions and nodded in response.

The strongest among them, Red Powder, had already submitted under Mo Qingyun’s fearsome aura.

If they continued to resist, it would be like seeking death.

They knew clearly in their hearts that if they expressed unwillingness, they would become the second Iron Cold Mountain.

Of course, at this moment, there were also their own plans in their hearts.

They all thought that they would pretend to submit first, preserving their lives. Then, they could quietly leave and inform the Ten Great Kingdoms of Mo Qingyun’s whereabouts, earning them a bounty.

This was a win-win situation.

Thinking this way, the few people beside him had cunning looks in their eyes and a cold smile appeared on their faces.

Mo Qingyun saw all these expressions and had a faint, amused smile on his face. He knew very clearly what was going through their minds.

Then, Mo Qingyun no longer hesitated and looked at them with a faint smile: "Since you are willing to submit, then open your souls and let me plant the Soul Binding Mark in your souls. This way, I can ensure that you are truly willing to submit to me!"

"What? Plant a Soul Binding Mark in our souls?"

"Are you going to turn us into puppets? What’s the point of living like that."

"It’s too much. I absolutely cannot agree with this, not even if it means death!"

...

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, a few people immediately expressed their dissatisfaction.

Seeing these people’s reactions, Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened and he said coldly: "If you do not agree, then die."

To avoid future rebellions, Mo Qingyun wanted to eliminate this possibility now.

For those who pretended to submit and were always thinking of betrayal, Mo Qingyun would not leave them.

Tong Power Ray!

As soon as Mo Qingyun spoke, he released the Tong Power Ray and attacked them.

Puchi...

Under Mo Qingyun’s attack, these few people had no resistance and were killed powerfully.

In a short while, there were several more corpses on the ground!

"His... How brutal!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s powerful killings, the few people beside him changed their expressions and sucked in a breath of cold air.

Seeing these people’s awe-struck expressions, Mo Qingyun showed a satisfied smile. The effect of killing a chicken to warn the monkeys was achieved.

Then, Mo Qingyun did not say much and looked at Red Powder solemnly: "Red Powder, start with you."

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Red Powder’s pretty face changed and she said in a bitter tone: "Yes!"

At this moment, Red Powder felt a blow.

Her proud appearance had no effect on Mo Qingyun at all.

In a short while, Mo Qingyun planted the Soul Binding Mark in Red Powder’s soul.

Seeing that even Red Powder was not spared, others’侥幸心理was instantly eliminated.

Compared to Red Powder, they had no advantage. If Mo Qingyun was not soft on such a beautiful woman like Red Powder, how could he be soft on them?

Then, the remaining people were each planted with a Soul Binding Mark by Mo Qingyun.

Thus, Red Powder City was thoroughly under Mo Qingyun’s control.

"Subordinate Red Powder... greets the master!"

After being planted with a Soul Binding Mark by Mo Qingyun, Red Powder and the others showed respectful expressions and bowed to him.

"Stand up."

Seeing their actions, Mo Qingyun nodded in satisfaction and indicated that they did not need to be overly polite.

"Thank you, master!"

Red Powder and the others thanked him and slowly stood up, standing respectfully in front of Mo Qingyun.

"What? Red Powder City’s lord has submitted!"

At this moment, Zhang Tianzhi, who was fighting Ling Luo, saw the scene and his face turned pale.

"Run!"

Then, Zhang Tianzhi trembled in fear and ran away without hesitation.

"It’s not that easy to escape."

Seeing Zhang Tianzhi’s actions, Ling Luo’s expression darkened and he swung his sword at him.

Ling Luo’s sword slashed out, instantly creating a sword light that pierced Zhang Tianzhi’s back, leaving a terrifying wound and blood flowing.

However, at this moment, Zhang Tianzhi did not care about it and ran for his life like a madman.

"You can’t escape!"

Seeing Zhang Tianzhi running wildly, Ling Luo’s expression darkened and he planned to continue chasing him.

"Ling Luo, no need to chase."

Seeing Ling Luo’s actions, Mo Qingyun called out to him and said indifferently: "He is just a small villain. No need to pay attention to him, he can’t escape."

"Yes, master!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Ling Luo nodded and walked towards Mo Qingyun, somewhat unwillingly: "Next time I meet him, I will definitely kill him."

For Ling Luo’s words of unwillingness, Mo Qingyun just smiled faintly and did not say much.

"From today on, Red Powder City will be renamed Four Symbols City."

Then, Mo Qingyun turned to look at Red Powder and said solemnly: "They four will be the new lords of Four Symbols City. You will be the deputy lord, and others will still follow your command."

Mo Qingyun continued: "Also, we five will usually be in cultivation. You can manage Red Powder City as usual. If you encounter any problems that cannot be solved, come to us."

"Yes, master!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Red Powder’s expression changed slightly and she nodded in response.

Next, Mo Qingyun instructed Red Powder and the others: "Red Powder, is there a relatively quiet place for cultivation in the lord’s mansion?"

Red Powder replied respectfully: "Master, there are a few secluded cultivation chambers in the lord’s mansion where we usually cultivate."

Hearing Red Powder’s words, Mo Qingyun nodded and said: "Since that is the case, lead us there."

After a moment, Mo Qingyun and the others arrived at the cultivation chambers led by Red Powder.

"You can leave now, I will call you if there is something."

After arriving at the cultivation chambers, Mo Qingyun waved his hand and indicated for Red Powder to leave.

Then, Mo Qingyun entered the cultivation chambers with Lu Fangliang and the others.

Entering a spacious room in the cultivation chamber, Mo Qingyun said: "Brother Lu, now I will set up a five-times time-shift array for you. In the future, you can cultivate in this time-shift array."

"Time-shift array?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Lu Fangliang and the others looked puzzled.

Their understanding of arrays could not compare to Mo Qingyun’s, so they did not know what a time-shift array was.

"A five-times time-shift array means that five days inside the array are equivalent to one day outside."

Seeing Lu Fangliang and the others’ puzzled expressions, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and explained: "So, cultivating five days in the time-shift array is equivalent to one day outside."

Five days inside are equivalent to one day outside?

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Lu Fangliang and the others’ expressions changed, showing shock. They almost did not believe their ears.

Wouldn’t their cultivation speed be five times faster than others’?

Puchi, puchi...

Thinking this way, Lu Fangliang and the others’ hearts raced, unable to calm down for a long time.

Seeing their shock, Mo Qingyun did not say much and started setting up the time-shift array for them.

With Jiugong’s help, who had reached Heaven Spirit Realm, setting up a five-times time-shift array was very simple for Mo Qingyun.

After a moment, with Jiugong’s help, Mo Qingyun completed the five-times time-shift array.

After finishing everything, Mo Qingyun instructed Lu Fangliang and the others and left their cultivation room.

Chapter 231: Blood Pool City’s Attack (Third Update)

After leaving Lu Fangliang and the others’ cultivation room, Mo Qingyun entered a slightly smaller cultivation chamber.

Entering this cultivation chamber, he started setting up an eight-times time-shift array to cultivate and improve his realm.

"Before cultivating, I should count the treasures in those乾坤bags."

Sitting down, Mo Qingyun suddenly brightened up and remembered the thousands of乾坤bags he obtained outside Jiugong’s secret storage.

With this thought, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and started counting his spoils.

After several hours, Mo Qingyun finally finished counting the treasures.

What shocked him was that the number of元灵stones in these thousands of乾坤bags reached over a hundred million.

This amount was much greater than he had expected.

However, thinking about the identities of those people before, Mo Qingyun was relieved.

Many of them were princes from various kingdoms and younger generations from powerful families, so it made sense that they had substantial assets.

Besides the large amount of元灵stones, Mo Qingyun also obtained nearly a million battlefield元crystals. This way, his cultivation resources were no longer an issue.

What truly made Mo Qingyun happy was that he obtained many alchemy materials from these乾坤bags.

As for other items like weapons, armors, martial techniques, and treasures, he did not pay much attention to them.

He planned to find an opportunity to sell those items and convert them into元灵stones, which was more practical.

"It’s no wonder many people are enthusiastic about looting. This is indeed the fastest way to become wealthy, and it’s really efficient."

At this moment, Mo Qingyun could not help but feel a sense of admiration.

Just one slaughter brought such gains. He did not doubt that if he looted a few more times, he would soon be as wealthy as a kingdom.

After a brief admiration, Mo Qingyun frowned and pondered: "Now that I have enough元灵stones, I can issue some bounty notices."

With this thought, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and left the cultivation chamber.

When leaving the cultivation chamber, Mo Qingyun sent a command to Red Powder through soul perception and asked her to come to the lord’s mansion hall immediately.

After a moment, Mo Qingyun arrived at the lord’s mansion hall. At this time, Red Powder and the others were already waiting.

"Master!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun arrive, Red Powder and the others immediately showed respectful expressions and bowed to him.

"Hmm!"

Seeing their expressions, Mo Qingyun nodded in response and threw a乾坤bag to Red Powder: "There is one billion元灵stones inside. Later, you will issue several bounty notices for me."

One billion元灵stones!

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Red Powder and the others were shocked in their hearts. They felt even more awe towards Mo Qingyun.

They did not expect that Mo Qingyun casually threw out one billion元灵stones.

After throwing the乾坤bag to Red Powder and the others, Mo Qingyun continued: "The content of the bounty notices is as follows. First, whoever provides accurate information about Eye Demon’s location will be rewarded with ten million元灵stones. Second, whoever kills someone from the Xia Kingdom’s Du Family will be rewarded with thirty million元灵stones. Third, whoever brings Zhang Tianzhi’s head will be rewarded with fifty million元灵stones..."

Then, Mo Qingyun explained the bounty notices he wanted to issue.

After finishing, Mo Qingyun instructed Red Powder and the others: "If you run out of元灵stones later, let me know immediately. I will give you another billion."

Another billion!

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Red Powder and the others were shocked again. They were amazed by Mo Qingyun’s wealth.

At this moment, when Red Powder and the others were in shock, Mo Qingyun threw several乾坤bags to her: "These contain some weapons, armors, martial techniques, and other items. Find a suitable opportunity to sell them and convert them into元灵stones."

After finishing his instructions, Mo Qingyun did not say much more and waved at Red Powder and the others: "Go ahead then."

"Yes, master. Red Powder takes leave..."

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Red Powder and the others nodded in response and walked out of the hall.

After Red Powder and the others left the hall, they opened the乾坤bags containing martial techniques and weapons. They were instantly stunned.

These乾坤bags were filled with various weapons, armors, and martial techniques.

Roughly calculating, these乾坤bags contained nearly ten thousand weapons and armors.

If each item was worth ten million元灵stones, the value of these乾坤bags would be at least a hundred billion元灵stones.

"Sss!"

Thinking this, everyone sucked in a breath of cold air and their hearts raced.

Mo Qingyun casually threw out several乾坤bags, each worth over a hundred billion元灵stones. This wealth was truly shocking.

"Red Powder City’s lord, do you think these things are...?"

At this moment, a quick-witted person quickly guessed the source of these items and looked at Red Powder in shock.

"These things should be left by those people killed by master outside Jiugong’s secret storage."

Red Powder responded solemnly to the person beside her: "Regarding master’s matters, we should not ask too much. Just do our best to serve him."

"Yes, yes, yes..."

Hearing Red Powder’s words, everyone nodded and started serving Mo Qingyun.

After instructing Red Powder and the others, Mo Qingyun returned to his cultivation chamber room.

Returning to the cultivation chamber, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and started cultivating immediately.

Then, he took out a large number of battlefield元crystals and placed them around his body to absorb and refine.

Under Mo Qingyun’s refinement, a stream of pure battlefield元force was extracted from the battlefield元crystals.

Once extracted, this battlefield元force surrounded Mo Qingyun’s body, forming a storm of元force that he slowly absorbed and refined.

As he absorbed and refined the battlefield元force, Mo Qingyun’s aura rapidly increased.

In a blink of ten days.

Under continuous absorption of battlefield元crystals, Mo Qingyun’s aura finally reached its peak.

Mo Qingyun was about to break through!

Discovering this, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and started compressing the元force within his body to break through the realm barrier.

Boom!

After several hours, Mo Qingyun’s aura suddenly surged, emitting a wave of元force.

His realm finally broke through to True Essence Realm Fourth Level.

"True Essence Realm Fourth Level!"

Feeling the breakthrough, Mo Qingyun’s expression brightened and he continued cultivating to stabilize his realm.

As Mo Qingyun cultivated again, a stream of pure battlefield元force was extracted from the battlefield元crystals around him.

After one day, Mo Qingyun stopped cultivating.

After a day of cultivation, Mo Qingyun’s realm stabilized at True Essence Realm Fourth Level.

Stopping his cultivation, Mo Qingyun frowned and pondered: "I wonder how Red Powder and the others are progressing?"

"Master, Blood Pool City is attacking!"

At this moment, as Mo Qingyun was pondering, Red Powder sent him a message through soul force.

Receiving Red Powder’s message, Mo Qingyun was initially surprised but then smiled faintly: "This is good. I will conquer another city and have it help me find Eye Demon’s location. With an additional city, the efficiency of handling matters will be higher."

With this thought, Mo Qingyun smiled and walked out of the cultivation chamber.

When Mo Qingyun arrived at the entrance of the cultivation chamber, Red Powder was already waiting outside.

"Master!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun come out, Red Powder showed a respectful expression and bowed to him.

Seeing Red Powder, Mo Qingyun’s expression turned cold and he said solemnly: "Where are they now? Take me to see them."

"Yes!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Red Powder nodded and led the way.

After a moment, under Red Powder’s guidance, Mo Qingyun arrived at the lord’s mansion hall.

In the lord’s mansion hall, a group of people with arrogant expressions were lounging around or standing.

Seeing Mo Qingyun arrive, one person among them showed an arrogant expression and glanced at him disdainfully: "Boy, you are that so-called Purple-Eyed Demon Lord? You don’t seem much."

Chapter 231: Black Abyss Valley (Fourth Update)

Ignoring this person’s words, Mo Qingyun swept his cold gaze over the crowd.

After a brief glance, he spotted a familiar figure in the crowd—Zhang Tianzhi who had escaped before.

Seeing Zhang Tianzhi, Mo Qingyun showed a hint of surprise and then smiled coldly: "Zhang Tianzhi, I didn’t expect you to dare return."

"Boy, I came back this time to take revenge on you all," Zhang Tianzhi said arrogantly.

Seeing Mo Qingyun, he no longer hid and sneered: "I want to tell you that the person beside me is Blood Pool City’s lord, Duan Wei. He is a True Essence Realm Seventh Level expert. With him here, you all won’t escape this time."

"Is True Essence Realm Seventh Level very strong?"

Hearing Zhang Tianzhi’s words, Mo Qingyun curled his lips slightly and showed a hint of disdain: "There was someone named Zhu Feng before, also at True Essence Realm Seventh Level. But he ended up being killed by me."

Zhu Feng!

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Duan Wei and the others’ expressions changed, showing shock.

They had heard of Blood Kingdom’s Blood Spear Zhu Feng. It was said that although his realm wasn’t high, his strength was terrifying.

They didn’t expect him to die at Mo Qingyun’s hands. This meant that Mo Qingyun’s strength should be above Zhu Feng.

Thinking this, Duan Wei’s expression changed and he looked at Mo Qingyun in shock: "You... You really killed Zhu Feng?"

"Ask about it in Red Powder City later," Mo Qingyun replied indifferently, his face slightly cold as he looked at Duan Wei and the others: "Before that, I give you a choice—submit to me like Red Powder or die. You have ten breaths to consider."

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, one person beside Duan Wei showed a disdainful expression and said coldly: "Boy, do you think we are scared by your words? I’ll see how you make me die."

Fatal Cut

As soon as Li Qichuan finished speaking, he held his black iron scythe and slashed fiercely at Mo Qingyun.

As the scythe swept past, a wisp of black ripple appeared on its blade, emitting a cold aura.

"Huh! This scythe..."

Seeing Li Qichuan’s scythe, Mo Qingyun’s expression changed and he showed a puzzled look.

He sensed an obscure soul fluctuation on Li Qichuan’s scythe, which surprised him.

However, after a brief surprise, Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened and he said coldly: "Since you seek death, I will fulfill your wish."

As soon as Mo Qingyun spoke, he took out his Fire Silk Blade and slashed at Li Qichuan.

As Mo Qingyun slashed, he released the three layers of Fire’s Essence Power without reservation.

The blade fell and flames surged on the Fire Silk Blade, emitting a terrifying aura that formed an enormous dragon shadow.

Roar!

As the fire dragon blade formed, it emitted a low roar and powerfully struck Li Qichuan.

Bang!

Li Qichuan, only at True Essence Realm Fifth Level, had no resistance against Mo Qingyun’s attack and was powerfully struck away.

As he struck Li Qichuan, Mo Qingyun took his black iron scythe and put it into a乾坤bag.

One move! Li Qichuan was crippled!

Seeing this, Duan Wei and the others’ pupils constricted. Their awe towards Mo Qingyun intensified.

Duan Wei knew clearly that the casual slash from Mo Qingyun could threaten them now.

This discovery made him hesitate for a moment.

From what he saw, Mo Qingyun’s words might be true—he really killed Blood Spear Zhu Feng.

However, if he submitted because of Mo Qingyun’s words, it would be too humiliating for him.

But if he didn’t submit, with Mo Qingyun’s strength to kill Zhu Feng, killing him wouldn’t be difficult.

"Time is up!"

As Duan Wei hesitated, Mo Qingyun’s words entered his ears and made him flinch.

"Choose now. Do you submit or die?"

Looking at Duan Wei and the others, Mo Qingyun said coldly, waiting for their answer.

"Duan... Duan Wei lord, you can’t submit to this boy because of his words!"

Seeing the scene before him, Zhang Tianzhi’s expression twitched and he looked tense as he tried to persuade Duan Wei.

He couldn’t help but be nervous. If Duan Wei and the others submitted, he would be alone and surely die.

Zhang Tianzhi didn’t expect that when he asked for Duan Wei’s help, he ended up bringing Mo Qingyun more subordinates.

This result made him very depressed. He never imagined it would happen like this.

As Zhang Tianzhi spoke to Duan Wei, Mo Qingyun looked at a True Essence Realm Fifth Level cultivator and asked coldly: "What is your choice?"

"I... I won’t submit to you..."

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, this person showed a terrified expression and responded bravely.

Tong Power Ray!

Seeing this person’s response, Mo Qingyun directly emitted a Tong Power Ray and pierced his head.

Puchi!

After being hit by the Tong Power Ray, this person’s eyes widened in terror and he fell to the ground.

Dead!

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s cold actions, Duan Wei and the others’ hearts trembled. Their fear intensified.

As Duan Wei and the others were in shock, Mo Qingyun looked at him and asked about his decision: "Duan Wei, have you made up your mind?"

"I... I will submit to you!"

After a moment of hesitation, Duan Wei gritted his teeth and made the decision to submit.

Although he was unwilling in his heart, he dared not take a risk. This risk was too great for him to bear.

"I... We will also submit!"

Seeing Duan Wei’s submission, his subordinates immediately showed fear and said their decision.

With their leader Duan Wei submitting to Mo Qingyun, they had no choice but to submit. Otherwise, they would be like Zhang Tianzhi.

Seeing everyone’s willingness to submit, Mo Qingyun showed a satisfied smile and said: "Very well. Now kill him."

As he spoke, Mo Qingyun pointed at Zhang Tianzhi beside them.

"Duan... Duan Wei lord, don’t kill me..."

Seeing Duan Wei and the others approaching him, Zhang Tianzhi’s expression twitched and he showed a pleading look.

However, Duan Wei ignored his plea and sneered: "Zhang Tianzhi, you made me submit to this boy. Now you want me to spare your life? Besides, if I don’t kill you, I will die. So, just accept your fate."

In Duan Wei’s view, if Zhang Tianzhi hadn’t urged him to come here, he wouldn’t have been forced to submit to Mo Qingyun.

After Duan Wei spoke, he ruthlessly attacked Zhang Tianzhi. In just a few exchanges, he killed him.

Seeing Duan Wei’s long sword pierce Zhang Tianzhi’s chest, Zhang Tianzhi’s face was filled with resentment and despair.

He never expected that the help he sought would end up killing him.

Seeing Duan Wei kill Zhang Tianzhi, Mo Qingyun nodded in satisfaction and said to Duan Wei and the others: "Open your souls and let me plant a soul mark in them."

"What? Plant a soul mark in our souls!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Duan Wei and the others’ expressions changed, showing a hint of anger.

In their view, Mo Qingyun’s request was too domineering.

For Duan Wei and the others’ reactions, Mo Qingyun did not care. He said coldly: "You can choose to refuse, but your fate will be the same as Zhang Tianzhi’s."

"Hmph! You are too much, boy. We won’t believe that so many of us can’t deal with you!"

"Right, let’s all attack him together and kill this boy!"

"Duan Wei lord, if we work together, maybe we can kill him. They say he has many treasures on him."

...

At this moment, the five or six people behind Duan Wei showed anger and greed. They wanted to kill Mo Qingyun for his treasures.

Soul Heaven Seal

Seeing their actions, Mo Qingyun did not hold back and launched several soul seals at them.

Puchi...

Facing the soul seals, they were struck and spat blood, their expressions blank.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate. He slashed at them with his sword and killed them.

"I... We will open our souls for you to plant the soul mark!"

Seeing this, Duan Wei and the others did not hesitate. They quickly pleaded with Mo Qingyun.

Then, Mo Qingyun planted soul marks in Duan Wei and the others’ souls. He said: "After returning to Blood Pool City, issue several bounty notices for me. First, provide Eye Demon’s location..."

Mo Qingyun told Duan Wei and the others about the bounty notices.

"Master, are you looking for Eye Demon?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Duan Wei’s expression changed and he looked at him in surprise.

Hearing Duan Wei’s words, Mo Qingyun showed a hint of expectation and asked: "Do you know Eye Demon’s location?"

"Hmm!"

Duan Wei nodded, his expression serious: "A month ago, I encountered some Eye Demons in Black Abyss Valley. However, now it is occupied by the Puppet Kingdom, fourth among the Ten Great Kingdoms. Outsiders can no longer enter."

Hearing Duan Wei’s words, Mo Qingyun pondered for a moment and said: "Tell me the location of Black Abyss Valley."

Knowing that there were Eye Demons in Black Abyss Valley, Mo Qingyun would not miss the opportunity. He did not care about Puppet Kingdom’s interference.

Chapter 232: "Black Abyss Transformation" (Fifth Update)

Before leaving, Mo Qingyun went to the cultivation chamber.

Arriving at the cultivation chamber, he set up a defensive array outside Lu Fangliang and the others’ cultivation room.

To prevent the Ten Great Kingdoms from causing trouble when he left, Lu Fangliang and the others would not be harmed.

"Brother Lu, in these days, you should not leave this array."

After setting up the defensive array, Mo Qingyun instructed Lu Fangliang and the others.

"Alright!" After hearing Lu Fangliang’s response, they all nodded in agreement.

Hearing their responses, Mo Qingyun did not say much more and walked towards his cultivation room.

Returning to his own cultivation room, Mo Qingyun started putting the eight-times time-shift array into Jiugong’s Array Disk.

After finishing this, Mo Qingyun could not stay any longer and left towards Black Abyss Valley.

According to Duan Wei’s description, Black Abyss Valley was some distance from Red Powder City. With Mo Qingyun’s speed, it would take about ten days to get there.

Additionally, Duan Wei mentioned that Black Abyss Valley was a famous dangerous place and also a well-known treasure-hunting spot in the Hundred Kingdoms Battlefield.

It was said that Black Abyss Valley was a cultivation place of a powerful figure, containing his legacy.

After hearing this information, Mo Qingyun’s anticipation for Black Abyss Valley increased even more.

"Jiugong, do you know about Black Abyss Valley?"

On the way to Black Abyss Valley, Mo Qingyun talked with Jiugong while traveling.

Mo Qingyun thought that since Jiugong appeared in the Hundred Kingdoms Battlefield, he should have some knowledge about it.
