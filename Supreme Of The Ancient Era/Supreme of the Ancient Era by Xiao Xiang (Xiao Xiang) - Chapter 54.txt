Seeing Long Yutian’s pleading gaze, Mo Qingyun explained to Ling Luo: "Ling Luo, Brother Long has good intentions. You just need to understand; there’s no need to say it directly."

What made Mo Qingyun feel helpless was that as soon as he spoke, Ling Luo’s expression became even more ambiguous.

"Boss, I understand."

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Ling Luo nodded and replied. Then he gave Long Yutian an ambiguous look and grinned wickedly, saying: "Brother Long, you get it!"

"You..."

Hearing Ling Luo’s words, Long Yutian was speechless and extremely frustrated. He pointed at Ling Luo but couldn’t utter a word for a long time.

However, Long Yutian clearly underestimated Ling Luo’s combativeness in this regard.

Seeing that Long Yutian didn’t speak, Ling Luo walked towards him with a mischievous smile and said in slight dissatisfaction: "Brother Long, don’t be petty. As brothers, we should share more..."

Following this, Ling Luo discussed various techniques and experiences with Long Yutian, causing him great torment. Long Yutian was thoroughly convinced of Ling Luo’s abilities and again turned to Mo Qingyun for help.

Seeing Long Yutian’s pleading gaze, Mo Qingyun smiled helplessly and said to Ling Luo: "Ling Luo, good things should be revealed at the end. Don’t ask Brother Long now; isn’t it better to leave some mystery?"

"Mystery!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Ling Luo’s eyes lit up and he said excitedly: "Boss, I understand, I get it!"

Fortunately, after Mo Qingyun’s explanation, Ling Luo stopped pestering Long Yutian.

Seeing this, Long Yutian relaxed and gave Mo Qingyun a grateful look.

Thus, after walking for some time with the three of them, they finally arrived at Long Yutian’s mentioned place.

It was a rather simple quadrangle courtyard, with only about ten simple wooden houses inside.

Outside the wooden houses stood two young men who seemed to be discussing something, and they looked somewhat alike.

"Brother Yutian, you’re back. Are these two the people you found?"

Seeing Long Yutian and his companions arrive, the two men at the door smiled and greeted him.

"Hmm!" Long Yutian nodded in response, asking: "Are everyone here?"

"Everyone is here!" the two men replied.

"You’re really a regular, Brother Long. Even the gatekeepers are familiar with you."

Seeing this scene, Ling Luo couldn’t hold back any longer and laughed excitedly while patting Long Yutian’s shoulder, examining the small courtyard with appreciation: "Hmph, although this place is a bit remote and dilapidated, the atmosphere is quite unique. I like it."

"Brother Ling, you misunderstand..."

Hearing Ling Luo’s words, Long Yutian was speechless and intended to explain.

But before he could finish his sentence, Ling Luo moved quickly and rushed into the courtyard with a stride.

"Wah, such beautiful girls, I’ve never seen them before. No wonder Brother Long often comes here."

Looking at the purple-clad woman in the courtyard, Ling Luo exclaimed with surprise and winked at Long Yutian: "Brother Long, you’re a good friend."

"Brother Ling, you misunderstand..."

Seeing Ling Luo’s actions, Long Yutian’s expression twitched and he became nervous. He waved at Ling Luo urgently, signaling him to come back quickly.

But what made Long Yutian helpless was that Ling Luo became even more excited after seeing his actions and rushed to the purple-clad woman, boasting: "Beauty, I’ll take you today. What’s your price?"

"Finished!"

Seeing Ling Luo’s actions, Long Yutian’s expression twitched and he said: "Trouble!"

Not only did Long Yutian feel this way, but the two young men beside him also twitched their expressions.

One of them looked at Ling Luo sympathetically and said: "This kid is finished. Talking to Ruoshui like this, he’s either dead or skinned."

"Hope he can see tomorrow’s sun," the other added.

"Hmm?"

The purple-clad woman, upon hearing Ling Luo’s words, her expression darkened and she said coldly: "Die!"

Clang!

The purple-clad woman drew her sword and slashed at Ling Luo.

Heavenly Frost Chill

As the woman’s sword slashed out, the surrounding temperature instantly became colder. A blue sword aura swept towards Ling Luo.

"Wah, such a wild beauty, I like her!"

Seeing the purple-clad woman’s actions, Ling Luo’s expression shook and became even more excited.

Exclaiming with excitement, he looked at the purple-clad woman with a playful smile and said: "Beauty, I’m also skilled with swords. Since you like this way, let’s play."

"Lecherous, die!"

Hearing Ling Luo’s words, the purple-clad woman’s expression became even colder and her actions more fierce.

"Finished, thoroughly finished."

Seeing this, Long Yutian raised his hand to pat his forehead and felt a headache.

"Brother Yutian, if you don’t save your friend now, he might really be killed by Ruoshui," one of the young men said to Long Yutian.

"Under these circumstances, even Brother Yutian might not be able to control the situation," another added.

At this moment, Ling Luo shouted for help towards Mo Qingyun: "Boss, save me. This woman is thorny."

Hearing Ling Luo’s words, everyone was speechless.

"Brother Long, you tricked me. I wouldn’t dare take such a woman even if she were given to me, I want to return her!"

After rushing out of the courtyard, Ling Luo looked at Long Yutian with a resentful gaze and said angrily: "Shameless, find your sword!"

Hearing Ling Luo’s words, the purple-clad woman shouted and slashed at him again with a fierce action.

Seeing this, Long Yutian couldn’t sit still anymore and hurriedly said to the purple-clad woman: "Miss Ruoshui, this is a misunderstanding. Please be lenient and let me explain."

"Hmph! Men are all no good!"

Seeing Long Yutian intervene, the purple-clad woman said coldly and glared at him: "Long Yutian, you’re such a person. I’ve mistaken you. Don’t meddle in this."

Hearing Ruoshui’s words, Long Yutian felt embarrassed and chuckled, feeling humiliated.

Helplessly, he looked at Mo Qingyun. In his view, it was better for Mo Qingyun to intervene now.

Because he knew that even if he intervened, he couldn’t handle this purple-clad woman.

"Boss, save me. This woman is too brutal; I’m about to be torn apart by her."

At this moment, as Long Yutian looked at Mo Qingyun, Ling Luo asked for help again.

At this point, Ling Luo was already in a sorry state, his clothes torn by the sword aura.

Dragon Seal

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun no longer hesitated and intervened to block the purple-clad woman’s attack for Ling Luo.

He knew that if it continued, Ling Luo might really be injured by the purple-clad woman’s attacks.

Of course, Mo Qingyun was also clear that Ling Luo’s sorry state mainly came from not using his full strength.

Otherwise, it would have been a different situation, possibly resulting in mutual destruction.

Sizzle...

The blue sword aura hit the Dragon Seal and instantly turned into a mist, dissipating in the air.

Seeing Mo Qingyun block her attack, the purple-clad woman’s expression darkened and she said coldly: "Move aside or don’t blame me for being rude."

"He’s my brother, I can’t let you harm him. Sorry," Mo Qingyun said with a shrug.

"Since you’re all the same, I’ll kill him first!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s answer, the purple-clad woman no longer spoke and slashed at him with a fierce action.

Dragon Seal

Seeing Ruoshui’s sword slash, Mo Qingyun didn’t hesitate and raised the Dragon Seal to block it.

Sizzle...

The ice-blue sword aura hit the flame shield and instantly turned into a mist, dissipating in the air.

"Boss, so cool!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun easily block Ruoshui’s attack, Ling Luo’s expression brightened and he exclaimed with excitement.

He looked as if the one blocking Ruoshui’s attack was himself.

"Brother Mo is really impressive!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s effortless action, Long Yutian also looked admiringly and was deeply impressed.

He believed that he couldn’t block Ruoshui’s attack as easily as Mo Qingyun did.

"Ruoshui’s full power strike was so easily blocked by him. This kid is not simple."

"Only at the True Essence Realm First Level, he can block Ruoshui’s attack so easily. This ability is really surprising."

"He specializes in fire power, which just克制s Ruoshui’s ice power. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been possible."

...

The two young men beside them also looked surprised and exclaimed one after another.

"You..."

Seeing his martial arts just被克制, Ruoshui’s expression turned angry.

Of course, she was more shocked. With her True Essence Realm Fourth Level cultivation, she was suppressed by someone at the First Level.

Even though Mo Qingyun’s fire martial arts just克制ed her ice martial arts, it wasn’t that simple to do so.

After all, no matter what, her cultivation was far higher than Mo Qingyun’s. This difference in cultivation couldn’t be ignored.

If Ruoshui knew that Mo Qingyun released the Fire Essence in his Dragon Seal when he attacked, she wouldn’t have been surprised.

Seeing Ruoshui no longer attack, Mo Qingyun looked apologetic and said to her: "Miss, my younger brother offended you just now. I apologize on his behalf."

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s sincere apology, Ruoshui’s expression softened.

She knew that with her martial arts being suppressed, even if she continued fighting, she wouldn’t gain any advantage.

So Mo Qingyun’s current actions seemed to be genuinely apologizing to her.

Thinking this, Ruoshui’s expression improved and she said coldly: "Doesn’t he have a mouth? Why does someone else need to apologize for him?"

"Didn’t I grow a mouth?"

Hearing Ruoshui’s words, Ling Luo looked dumbfounded and was stunned.

Seeing his expression, Mo Qingyun glared at him and urged: "What are you staring at? Quickly come over and apologize to Miss Ruoshui."

"Oh!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Ling Luo looked reluctant and walked to Ruoshui, apologizing: "I offended you just now. Please forgive me."

"Hmph!"

Seeing Ling Luo’s not-so-sincere apology, Ruoshui huffed and gave him a cold look before ignoring him.

"Phew!"

Seeing the misunderstanding resolved, Long Yutian sighed in relief and gave Mo Qingyun a thumbs up.

He didn’t expect that with Ruoshui’s personality, she would accept Mo Qingyun’s apology so easily.

At this moment, as Mo Qingyun and the others talked, four figures approached.

"Haha, quite lively. Everyone is here."

As those four figures came closer, one of them laughed and greeted everyone.

Seeing the four people arrive, Long Yutian looked puzzled and asked: "Eh, where’s Brother Lu?"

"Brother Lu? He went back inside."

One of the newcomers smiled awkwardly and said: "His personality is clear, he doesn’t like noisy places."

"Indeed!"

Hearing this, Long Yutian chuckled and said: "Everyone, let me introduce you..."

Following this, Long Yutian introduced everyone to Mo Qingyun.

After Long Yutian’s introduction, Mo Qingyun learned that the four people who looked alike were the Left brothers—Left Mu, Left Lin, Left Sen, and Left Cai.

However, when introducing the remaining two people, Long Yutian looked puzzled and asked Left Mu: "Brother Mu, who are these two?"

Seeing Long Yutian’s puzzled expression, Left Mu smiled faintly and introduced: "These two are Ma Jue and Ma Hua."

At this moment, as Left Mu introduced Ma Jue, Ma Jue looked at Ruoshui with a flattering expression and asked: "Miss Ruoshui, is someone making you unhappy? Tell me who it is, and I’ll teach him a lesson."

"No need. I can handle my own affairs," Ruoshui said coldly, looking at him with disdain.

However, when she responded to Ma Jue, her gaze glanced towards Mo Qingyun’s side.

Seeing this, Ma Jue looked arrogantly at Mo Qingyun and said coldly: "Boy, it’s you who made Miss Ruoshui unhappy. I don’t care why you did this; now, immediately apologize to Miss Ruoshui."

"Meddling like a dog catching mice. Does it matter if my boss made her unhappy?"

Hearing Ma Jue’s words, Ling Luo rolled his eyes and looked at him disdainfully.

Seeing Ling Luo’s attitude, Ma Jue’s expression darkened and he said coldly: "Boy, do you know the consequences of your words?"

Seeing Ma Jue’s arrogant expression, Ling Luo looked at him challengingly and said disdainfully: "I don’t know what the consequences of my words are, but I know that trying to please a woman by trampling on others is not your qualification."

Ling Luo continued: "And, someone like you who’s always flattering others is disgusting and annoying. Don’t you see yourself in the mirror? Are you worthy of Miss Ruoshui?"

Hearing Ling Luo’s words, Ruoshui’s expression changed slightly and her gaze towards him became less hostile.

It seemed that Ling Luo’s words hit a nerve with her.

"Brother Long, your friend’s words are rather excessive."

At this moment, as Ling Luo spoke, Left Mu looked displeased and said with dissatisfaction to Long Yutian.

"Excessive?"

Hearing Left Mu’s words, Mo Qingyun narrowed his eyes and looked at him coldly: "Just now, Ma Jue wanted to please Miss Ruoshui by trampling on me. Why didn’t you say his actions were excessive?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Left Mu’s expression darkened again and he said to Long Yutian with displeasure: "Brother Long, are these the friends you brought?"

Hearing Left Mu’s words, Long Yutian took a sip of wine leisurely and said with a faint smile: "Brother Mu, this is Brother Mo’s matter with Ma Jue. I think as bystanders, we shouldn’t interfere."

After saying this, Long Yutian walked to the side with his wine flask and said to Mo Qingyun with a faint smile: "Brother Mo, this situation makes me hard-pressed to solve. You two should handle it yourselves. Hope you understand."

At the same time, Long Yutian gave Mo Qingyun a glance, meaning he didn’t need to hold back.

"Alright!"

Seeing Long Yutian’s gesture, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and nodded in agreement.

Seeing this, the Left brothers didn’t say much either and walked to the side with displeased expressions.

Seeing this, Ruoshui looked at Mo Qingyun complexly and followed him to the side.

At this moment, everyone cleared a space for Mo Qingyun’s group to resolve their conflict.

"A True Essence Realm First Level and Third Level boy, daring to challenge us. I think you’re tired of living!"

Seeing everyone let them resolve their conflict, Ma Jue smiled coldly and said arrogantly: "With our brothers’ True Essence Realm Fourth Level cultivation, it’s too simple to deal with you two."

After Ma Jue spoke, Ma Hua also smiled coldly and looked at Mo Qingyun and Ling Luo: "Boy, we’ll spare you for Brother Mu’s sake. If you now kneel and beg for mercy, then break one arm and leg each, we’ll spare your lives."

"Kneel for mercy?"

Hearing Ma Hua’s words, Ling Luo rolled his eyes and said disdainfully: "Not that I look down on you. With your current state, even if I let you have one hand, I can easily finish you."

"Boy, you’re asking for death!"

Hearing Ling Luo’s words, Ma Hua gritted his teeth and attacked without further ado.

Wild Horse Breaking Loose

Ma Hua’s fists surged with essence energy, like a flood breaking through a dam, forming several horse shadows that trampled towards Ling Luo.

Sword Bursting Like Meteors

Seeing Ma Jue attack, Ling Luo didn’t hesitate and retaliated.

Ling Luo raised his hand, a silver longsword appeared in it, and he swung it continuously, emitting dazzling light.

These lights turned into sword auras that slashed towards the horse shadows like meteors.

Bang, bang, bang...

The sword auras struck the horse shadows and exploded with starburst sounds.

Seeing Ma Hua and Ling Luo’s fierce battle, Ma Jue smiled coldly: "Brother Two is too hasty."

With a cold smile, Ma Jue looked arrogantly at Mo Qingyun and said: "Boy, how do you want to die?"

"How do I want to die?"

Hearing Ma Jue’s words, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and replied: "You think too highly of yourself. To deal with you, I don’t even need to move my hands."

Not moving his hands!

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, everyone except Long Yutian was shocked.

They were amazed by his arrogant words.

Mo Qingyun’s current words were too arrogant.

Defeating someone without moving hands?

"Big talk!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Ma Jue no longer spoke and attacked him directly: "Boy, let me see how you defeat me without moving your hands."

Silver Horse Soaring

As Ma Jue spoke, he leaped up and punched at Mo Qingyun.

After leaping into the air, Ma Jue’s essence energy surged, forming a flying horse shadow.

As he approached Mo Qingyun, his aura became more terrifying, like an untamed wild horse.

"Such a powerful martial art. Ma Jue’s strength is much stronger than we expected."

"To deal with him now, I would need to put in some effort."

"From Ma Jue’s current display of strength, that boy is likely in trouble."

"What? This boy has such abilities?"

...

Seeing Ma Jue attack, Left Mu and the others changed their expressions and expressed their thoughts.

As they exchanged glances, Long Yutian looked at Mo Qingyun with a faint smile and drank leisurely without speaking.

Ruoshui, on the other hand, stood silently with a cold expression, watching Mo Qingyun’s battle.

Seeing Ma Jue rush towards him, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and retaliated.

Golden Jade True Body

As soon as Mo Qingyun moved, he activated the Golden Jade True Body technique. His aura surged and a golden jade glow appeared on his skin.

Gravity Suppression!

After activating the Golden Jade True Body, Mo Qingyun released Earth Essence and his aura surged again.

Then he took a step forward, carrying an astonishing pressure towards the rapidly approaching Ma Jue.

This pressure spread like a wave and carried a terrifying impact force.

Under this impact, the ground around Mo Qingyun sank, dust flying everywhere.

Bang!

At the same time, Ma Jue was pressed down by this terrifying pressure and fell to the ground.

Puh!

Under the heavy gravity, Ma Jue spat blood and his face turned pale as he looked at Mo Qingyun in fear.

Essence Power!

He sensed powerful essence power on Mo Qingyun, which was beyond his expectations.

What frightened him more was that under this essence power’s suppression, he couldn’t even stand up.

How could he fight Mo Qingyun then?

Thinking this, Ma Jue looked bitter and finally understood the meaning of Mo Qingyun’s words.

Under his essence power suppression, he couldn’t even stand up. How could Mo Qingyun need to move his hands to deal with him?

Earth Essence!

Sensing Mo Qingyun’s essence power, Left Mu and the others were shocked and widened their eyes.

Mo Qingyun had领悟ed essence power, which was beyond their expectations.

What shocked them more was that Mo Qingyun’s control over essence power wasn’t just at the initial stage of领悟.

"Earth Essence, this boy has mastered essence power. How is that possible?"

"Has his true cultivation reached the peak of True Essence Realm?"

"Is he deliberately suppressing his cultivation, not breaking through to the Nascent Soul Realm, just to enter the True Essence Battlefield?"

...

For a moment, Left Mu and the others’ expressions changed as they guessed.

They believed that Mo Qingyun’s cultivation might have reached the peak of True Essence Realm, given his essence power.

"Back then when I fought him, he didn’t use full strength!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s essence power, Ruoshui was shocked and couldn’t calm down for a long time.

Recalling their previous battle, she pouted and felt somewhat depressed.

Mo Qingyun had easily suppressed her without using full strength in their previous battle.

This result was somewhat disappointing to her.

From this, it could be seen that the gap between their strengths was quite large.

Compared to Left Mu and the others’ shock, Long Yutian’s reaction was much calmer.

After all, he had seen Mo Qingyun’s essence power when he fought Lei Hong before.

Ignoring everyone’s reactions, Mo Qingyun walked towards Ma Jue slowly.

Bang, bang, bang...

With each step Mo Qingyun took, the pressure on Ma Jue increased.

Puh!

Finally under this pressure, Ma Jue spat blood again and looked at Mo Qingyun in fear.

Seeing Ma Jue’s expression, Mo Qingyun looked at him disdainfully and mocked: "Now do you think I need to move my hands to deal with you?"

"I..."

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Ma Jue was speechless and didn’t know how to respond.

"Get out!"

Seeing the speechless Ma Jue, Mo Qingyun kicked him without further ado.

Puh!

After being kicked by Mo Qingyun, Ma Jue spat blood again and looked even paler, lying on the ground half-dead.

Seeing Ma Jue lying there like a dead dog, Mo Qingyun said disdainfully: "Today, I’ll spare your life for Brother Long’s sake."

After saying this, Mo Qingyun walked towards Long Yutian and watched Ling Luo’s battle.

"Thank you, Brother Mo."

Seeing Mo Qingyun approach, Long Yutian looked grateful and thanked him.

He knew that Mo Qingyun spared Ma Jue considering he was brought by Left Mu and the others.

If Mo Qingyun had killed Ma Jue, it would have been difficult for him to explain to Left Mu and the others.

"Wow, boss is so cool. He finished the battle so quickly."

Seeing Mo Qingyun finish his battle, Ling Luo was shocked and said: "Looks like I need to speed up."

Then he didn’t hesitate and attacked with full strength.

Soul Sword, Manifest!

As Ling Luo spoke, he summoned his soul sword. His aura became more fierce.

At the same time, a silver sword shadow appeared above his body, radiating sharp soul energy.

Soul Sword, Level Twelve Ordinary Soul, Ling Luo actually had a Level Twelve Superb Soul!

Seeing this, everyone’s expressions changed and they were shocked.

"This boy actually has a Level Twelve Soul!"

Seeing Ling Luo’s soul sword, Ruoshui was shocked and wondered: "This boy is so strong. Did he deliberately let me down just now?"

Sword Riding!

After summoning his soul sword, Ling Luo didn’t hesitate and used a soul technique.

With the soul technique activated, eight swords appeared in Ling Luo’s hand and fiercely attacked Ma Hua.

Swoosh...

Nine longswords, controlled by Ling Luo, emitted piercing sounds and slashed towards Ma Hua like lightning.

Under Ling Luo’s fierce attacks, Ma Hua was put in a passive position and faced many dangers.

Puh...

Before long, Ma Hua was caught off guard and slashed by the swords, his body covered in terrifying wounds, blood flowing profusely.

Seeing this, Ling Luo stopped attacking and looked at Ma Hua disdainfully: "You’re too weak. I haven’t even used full strength, and you’ve already given up. Disappointing."

After saying this, Ling Luo walked to Mo Qingyun with a pleased expression and said: "Boss, how was my performance?"

"Haha, not bad!"

Hearing Ling Luo’s words, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and patted his shoulder encouragingly.

"What happened?"

As Ling Luo approached Mo Qingyun, a cold voice came from the small house nearby.

Then Mo Qingyun saw a young man in white with a crescent short sword on his back walking towards them.

"Brother Lu, you’re here!"

Seeing the young man in white approach, Long Yutian smiled faintly and greeted him: "Just now, my two friends had a small conflict with the Ma brothers."

"Oh!"

Hearing Long Yutian’s words, the young man in white nodded and glanced at Mo Qingyun and Ling Luo without saying much.

"Brother Mo, Brother Ling, this is Lu Fangliang."

Long Yutian smiled faintly and introduced them: "Brother Lu, this is Brother Mo..."

Then Mo Qingyun and Ling Luo greeted Lu Fangliang with a nod.

At this moment, Left Mu looked displeased and said impatiently: "Brother Lu, these two are rude. They injured the Ma brothers over a small matter. Please judge this."

"Right!"

Left Sen added: "The Ma brothers were here to replace the remaining two, and now they’re injured. Won’t it delay our journey?"

"Pah! Nonsense, they started the trouble to please Miss Ruoshui."

Hearing Left Mu’s words, Ling Luo was angry and defended himself.

"Young man, you’re asking for it!"

Hearing Ling Luo’s words, Left Mu’s expression darkened and he glared at him.

"Left Mu, hold on!"

Seeing Left Mu’s actions, Lu Fangliang shouted and stopped him: "Brother Long, what happened?"

It seemed that in Lu Fangliang’s heart, he trusted Long Yutian more.

"It was like this..."

Seeing Lu Fangliang look at him, Long Yutian explained the situation.

"Brother Mu, this is their private matter. We shouldn’t interfere."

After Long Yutian explained, Lu Fangliang said coldly: "As for the remaining two spots, how about letting these two take over?"

When Lu Fangliang said this, he pointed at Mo Qingyun and Ling Luo.

Hearing Lu Fangliang’s words, Long Yutian smiled and said: "Brother Lu, I brought Brother Mo here precisely for the remaining two spots."

When Long Yutian said this, everyone’s expressions changed and they were surprised.

"Brother Lu, these two are still questionable. Don’t let them join."

Hearing Lu Fangliang’s decision, Left Sen was surprised and argued.

"I think these two are better than the Ma brothers."

As Left Sen spoke, Ruoshui suddenly said her opinion.

Hearing Ruoshui’s words, everyone was surprised by her decision.

Logically, Ling Luo had angered Ruoshui earlier; she should have strongly opposed it.

Seeing Ruoshui’s actions, Ling Luo’s eyes lit up and he flattered her: "Miss Ruoshui, you’re beautiful and wise."

"Less flattering! I just think we need a powerful ally after entering the Nine Palaces Secret Treasure."

Hearing Ling Luo’s words, Ruoshui looked at him coldly: "And don’t think I’m talking about you."

As she said this, Ruoshui glanced at Mo Qingyun with a different look.

"Hmm!"

Receiving Ruoshui’s cold glance, Ling Luo looked embarrassed and felt awkward.

"I think these two are better than the Ma brothers."

At this moment, Long Yutian smiled and expressed his opinion.

"Since everyone thinks these two are better, let them replace the Ma brothers."

At this moment, a cunning look flashed in Left Mu’s eyes and he said with a cold smile: "Brother, let them replace the Ma brothers."

"Big Brother, why...?"

Hearing Left Mu’s words, Left Sen and the others were surprised and didn’t understand why he did this.

Logically, since Ma Jue and Ma Hua were brought by him, he should have strongly opposed it.

Left Mu’s unusual actions made Left Lin and the others puzzled.

"Brother Two, Brother Three, Brother Four, since Brother Lu is our leader and he has spoken, let’s follow him."

Left Mu smiled faintly at Left Lin and the others.

Then he looked coldly at Mo Qingyun and instructed: "Help Ma Jue and Ma Hua up, let’s go back inside."

"Yes, Big Brother!"
