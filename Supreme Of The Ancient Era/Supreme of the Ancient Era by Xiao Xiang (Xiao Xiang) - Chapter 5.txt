Seeing the situation, Mo Qingyun no longer hesitated and immediately took most of the plate of Fire Cloud Beast.

Mo Feilin did not know Mo Qingyun's true intention for eating the Fire Cloud Beast. Seeing this, he thought that Mo Qingyun really liked the charcoal-grilled Fire Cloud Beast and smiled, saying, "The taste is good, isn’t it? If you like it, we can order another portion."

Hearing Mo Feilin's words, Mo Qingyun immediately changed his expression and hurriedly stopped him, saying, "No need, one portion is enough."

When ordering the dishes earlier, Mo Qingyun had noticed that the Fire Cloud Beast was the most expensive, costing nearly four hundred gold coins for a portion.

This wasn’t something Mo Qingyun could casually afford at the moment. Having one portion was already luxurious.

In Mo Qingyun's view, although the blood and flesh of the Fire Cloud Beast contained flame power, it was still not as effective for him as Foundation Condensation Liquid.

He felt that spending this money on Fire Cloud Beast meat would be better spent purchasing some Foundation Condensation Liquid.

About an hour later, Mo Qingyun and his companion finished all the dishes on the table completely.

After eating the Fire Cloud Beast meat, Mo Qingyun found that his cultivation had advanced a bit and was closer to the Fifth Level of Body Refinement.

Moreover, he noticed that after absorbing the flame power from the Fire Cloud Beast, the soul energy of his Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial spirit had grown significantly.

"Uncle Four, do you know where there are medicinal herbs for sale in Lianyun City?"

After a full meal, Mo Qingyun asked Mo Feilin.

"Where are there medicinal herbs for sale?"

Hearing this, Mo Feilin looked thoughtful and said after a moment, "Go to the Hundred Herbs Pavilion. It is the largest pharmacy in Lianyun City and has all kinds of medicinal herbs, with very reasonable prices."

"Uncle Four, I plan to buy some medicinal herbs to make Foundation Condensation Liquid. Would you accompany me?"

Hearing Mo Feilin's words, Mo Qingyun no longer hesitated and said to him.

"Alright!"

Mo Feilin nodded, leading Mo Qingyun to the Hundred Herbs Pavilion.

After a short while, Mo Qingyun and his companion arrived at the Hundred Herbs Pavilion.

Entering the Hundred Herbs Pavilion, Mo Qingyun no longer hesitated and walked in directly.

The operation mode of the Hundred Herbs Pavilion was similar to that of the Treasured Spirit Shop in Beimozhen Town, where one first writes a prescription, pays, and then collects the medicine.

Whether you need to decoct or refine the medicine depends on your needs.

Mo Qingyun was very clear about the true intention behind this mode of operation. These pharmacies did it to see if they could discover some medicinal formulas.

Some people who didn’t understand the situation would truthfully write down the ingredients needed for the pills.

However, Mo Qingyun didn’t mind this. As a young Pill Master of the Heavenly Soul Continent in his previous life, he could change the formula without these people from Hundred Herbs Pavilion discovering it.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun no longer hesitated and picked up a brush to write the prescription quickly.

Then he paid and went to the counter to collect the medicine.

Soon, the herbs were ready. Mo Qingyun took them from the clerk and walked towards Mo Feilin.

At this moment, two women were standing in front of Mo Feilin. They looked about the same age as him.

The two women were very similar in appearance and should be sisters. They seemed to be familiar with Mo Feilin.

After glancing at the two women, Mo Qingyun noticed that the younger woman looked at Mo Feilin with a hint of tenderness and affection in her eyes.

As for the older one, she looked at Mo Feilin with a touch of disdain and disgust.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun, with his extensive experience from his previous life, quickly understood the situation.

Then he smiled playfully and thought to himself, "Could this woman be his future aunt?"

After that, Mo Qingyun smiled playfully and walked towards Mo Feilin.

"Uncle Four!"

Arriving beside Mo Feilin, Mo Qingyun greeted him and asked, "Who are they?"

"Qingyun, let me introduce you. These two ladies are Miss Wu Ruo and Miss Wu Qing from the Wu Family in Shili Town."

Seeing Mo Qingyun arrive, Mo Feilin smiled faintly and introduced them.

Following that, Mo Feilin also introduced Mo Qingyun to Wu Ruo and Wu Qing, saying, "Ruo, Miss Qing, this is my third brother's son, Mo Qingyun."

Hearing the introduction, Wu Ruo politely nodded and greeted Mo Qingyun.

However, when Wu Qing heard the introduction, she sneered and said disdainfully, "A country bumpkin, what’s there to introduce about him."

Hearing Wu Qing's words, Mo Qingyun frowned and a cold light flashed in his eyes.

But considering Mo Feilin's face, Mo Qingyun didn’t say anything and just glanced at Wu Qing before ignoring her.

Wu Qing, after uttering a disdainful remark, looked at Mo Feilin with contempt and said, "Mo Feilin, remember your place. Ruo is not someone you can call by her name."

When Wu Qing spoke, Mo Feilin felt embarrassed and chuckled, glancing at Wu Ruo.

Seeing Mo Feilin's awkward expression, Wu Ruo became indignant and glared at Wu Qing, saying, "Sister, how can you say that to Feilin?"

"Feilin, my sister is straightforward. Don’t take it to heart."

Wu Ruo looked apologetic and explained to Mo Feilin.

From this, it seemed that she cared about Mo Feilin.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun’s understanding of the relationship between Mo Feilin and Wu Ruo became clearer.

At present, it seemed that Wu Ruo and Mo Feilin had mutual feelings for each other, while the Wu Family did not look favorably upon Mo Feilin.

Hearing Wu Ruo’s apology, Mo Feilin felt moved and smiled faintly, saying, "Ruo, don’t worry. I won’t be angry with Miss Qing."

"Don’t call me Miss Qing, I’m not your sister. Don’t try to be close with me."

Hearing Wu Qing’s words, Mo Qingyun frowned and said sarcastically, "Sister, you’ve already set a condition. If he can’t come up with ten thousand spirit stones as dowry, you won’t allow him to see you."

"Ten thousand spirit stones!"

Hearing Wu Qing’s words, Mo Feilin and Wu Ruo both looked shocked, their faces pale.

Not only did Mo Feilin and Wu Ruo feel powerless at the moment, but even Mo Qingyun was slightly surprised.

Ten thousand spirit stones were a huge sum for Mo Feilin.

Spirit Stones contained the essence of heaven and earth, providing energy for True Essence realm cultivators.

Usually, one spirit stone was worth ten thousand gold coins and were in high demand.

This showed how precious spirit stones were.

Now, Mo Feilin’s condition for dating Wu Ruo was to provide ten thousand spirit stones as dowry.

It was obvious that the Wu Family was making things difficult for Mo Feilin.

Not only Mo Feilin, but even the entire Mo Family would struggle to gather ten thousand spirit stones.

Even a hundred spirit stones were difficult for them.

Probably even the Wu Family couldn’t come up with ten thousand spirit stones.

Seeing Mo Feilin and Wu Ruo’s worried expressions, Mo Qingyun narrowed his eyes and thought to himself.

After a brief moment of contemplation, he looked at Wu Ruo with a playful smile and said calmly, "Aunt Four, don’t worry. Uncle Four will definitely gather the dowry. Just wait for him."

Mo Qingyun’s words were not empty talk; at that moment, he had made up his mind.

Ten thousand spirit stones was a huge sum for Mo Feilin, but to Mo Qingyun, it was just the matter of refining a few batches of second-grade pills and not difficult at all.

If necessary, he could also auction off some martial techniques in the Lianyun City Auction House.

Although this might cause unnecessary trouble, Mo Qingyun was willing to take the risk for Mo Feilin.

"Aunt Four?"

When Mo Qingyun called her "Aunt Four," the three of them were stunned, looking at him in surprise.

After a brief moment of shock, Wu Ruo blushed and glanced shyly at Mo Feilin.

From her expression, it seemed that she didn’t mind this and tacitly accepted Mo Qingyun’s actions.

However, Wu Qing, upon hearing this, frowned and said coldly, "Not old enough to talk big. Ten thousand spirit stones aren’t something you can just say."

Seeing Wu Qing’s haughty expression, Mo Qingyun looked at her disdainfully and smiled at Mo Feilin, saying, "Uncle Four, let’s go. With this harridan around, you and Aunt Four can’t talk comfortably."

"Yellow-faced shrew!"

When Mo Qingyun said this, Wu Qing and the others’ faces changed again, looking at him.

Not only did Wu Qing and her companions look at Mo Qingyun, but even the customers and employees of Hundred Herbs Pavilion were surprised.

Many people knew Wu Ruo’s identity; they came from the Wu Family in Shili Town and had some influence in Lianyun City, considered a secondary power.

Now, a country bumpkin from the countryside was speaking to Wu Qing like this, which was quite surprising.

"Country bumpkin, you’re asking for trouble!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Wu Qing was furious and raised her hand to slap him.

Seeing this, Mo Feilin’s face changed and hurriedly explained, "Miss Qing, don’t be angry. Qingyun didn’t mean it..."

At the same time, he raised his hand to block Wu Qing’s strike.

Although Wu Qing was not old, she was a True Essence realm expert and her palm wasn’t something Mo Qingyun could withstand.

Under Wu Qing’s strike, Mo Feilin barely managed to block it but was pushed back several steps, his face turning red and blood surging.

"Feilin, are you alright?"

Seeing Mo Feilin’s condition, Wu Ruo was concerned and helped him up, glaring at Wu Qing, saying, "Sister, you’re too harsh. How could you hit Feilin so hard?"

"Hmph! It’s not my fault, he chose to block for this boy."

Wu Qing said indifferently about Mo Feilin’s injuries.

Then she looked at Mo Qingyun coldly and said, "Country bumpkin, I’ll give you a chance to apologize. Now, slap yourself one hundred times and kneel down to beg for forgiveness from me."

"Slap himself a hundred times, kneel and beg?"

Hearing Wu Qing’s words, Mo Qingyun’s eyes flashed with cold light as he said arrogantly, "I’ll tell you, now apologize to Uncle Four. I can forgive you once for your sister’s sake. Otherwise, even if you apologize in the future, I won’t give you a chance."

"Make me apologize? It’s laughable. What makes you think I should apologize to a country bumpkin from the countryside?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Wu Qing laughed coldly as if she had heard the funniest joke.

After a moment of laughter, she looked at Wu Ruo and Mo Feilin, saying, "You saw it. It’s not that I didn’t give him a chance; he just didn’t take the opportunity."

"This..."

Hearing Wu Qing’s words, Wu Ruo and Mo Feilin were hesitant, looking troubled.

Wu Qing’s request was too much; to slap himself a hundred times and kneel to beg for forgiveness.

However, Wu Qing’s status was not simple. Mo Feilin worried that she would take revenge on Mo Qingyun.

At this moment, a pill master suddenly spoke up from the side, looking at Mo Qingyun with a mischievous smile and said, "If I were you, I would kneel down now and slap myself a hundred times to beg for forgiveness from Miss Wu Qing."

"I think, with Miss Wu Qing’s magnanimity, she would forgive you," the pill master said slyly to Wu Qing.

Wu Qing seemed to enjoy this flattery and smiled smugly, looking haughtily at Mo Qingyun, waiting for him to kneel and beg.

However, when everyone was waiting for Mo Qingyun’s next move,

Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened and he looked disdainfully at the pill master, saying, "If I were you, I would shut up now and watch this alchemy furnace carefully. Otherwise, when the pill explodes, even with Miss Wu Qing’s magnanimity, she won’t spare you."

With Mo Qingyun’s sharp eyes, he could see that the pill master’s alchemy was in trouble; the fire was too strong and it might explode soon.

Moreover, from his brief observation, Mo Qingyun noticed that Wu Ruo and Wu Qing were also buying medicinal herbs to refine pills.

They chose to refine the pills on the spot, and this pill master was refining their pills for them.

Of course, Wu Qing and Wu Ruo were refining low-grade pills.

The higher the grade of the pill, the more difficult it was to refine and required undisturbed concentration.

The pills being refined in this hall were low-grade ones, usually fine as long as they weren’t disturbed.

Of course, like this pill master who was refining while chatting, it was a different story.

"Will my pills explode?"

The pill master looked surprised and then laughed, saying, "Did you hear what he said? He said my pills will explode. It’s hilarious."

"Kid, do you know that Master Jiangcheng was a high-level apprentice alchemist three years ago and is now a quasi-first-grade pill master?"

At this moment, the lower-level pill master beside Jiangcheng introduced him with flattery.

Pill masters were ranked as Apprentice Alchemists, First-grade Pill Masters... Ninth-grade Pill Masters, Pill Kings, Pill Emperors, and Pill Sages.

Generally, only high-level pill masters were called Masters.

Now, Jiangcheng was just a high-level apprentice alchemist but was called Master, which seemed somewhat exaggerated.

But Jiangcheng enjoyed this and looked proud when he heard the words.

"Kid, I don’t know how you knew I was refining Gathering Essence Pills. But do you think that makes you an alchemist?"

Jiangcheng looked haughty and said to Mo Qingyun, "I can only say you’re naive."

"Huh! Is that so?"

Hearing Jiangcheng’s words and looking at the current situation in the alchemy furnace, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and said, "Originally, I thought your batch of pills still had a chance. But now there’s no hope left; they will explode within ten breaths."

After saying this, Mo Qingyun said to Mo Feilin and Wu Ruo, "Uncle Four, Aunt Four, let’s move to the side. We don’t want to be affected when the pills explode."

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Wu Ruo and Mo Feilin were surprised. After a moment of hesitation, they followed his suggestion and moved to the side.

"Sister!"

Wu Ruo walked away from Wu Qing, perhaps out of concern for her sister and gestured to her to move to the side.

But Wu Qing, seeing Wu Ruo’s gesture, sneered and said coldly, "Hmph! Making a show. I don’t believe that a country bumpkin from the countryside knows alchemy. If these pills explode, I’ll..."

Bang!

Before Wu Qing could finish her words, a loud sound echoed in the hall.

The pills exploded!

Everyone’s hearts jolted at this sound, involuntarily thinking that the pills had indeed exploded.

Then they saw that the source of the sound was where Jiangcheng, the pill master, had been standing.

The pills really did explode!

Seeing the alchemy furnace shattered by the explosion, everyone’s hearts were answered.

Mo Qingyun was right; within ten breaths, these pills would explode.

Then everyone looked at Mo Qingyun with different eyes.

Was Mo Qingyun an alchemist?

Otherwise, how could he predict that Jiangcheng’s batch of pills would explode.

More importantly, Mo Qingyun could foresee what Jiangcheng couldn’t.

This meant that Mo Qingyun’s alchemy skills were above Jiangcheng’s.

Jiangcheng was a quasi-first-grade pill master, and Mo Qingyun being above him meant he was at least a first-grade pill master.

As for what grade above that, no one dared to guess because Mo Qingyun was so young.

Now, Mo Qingyun seemed only fifteen or sixteen years old.

Many people of that age were just apprentice alchemists.

But Mo Qingyun was already likely a first-grade pill master, which was quite impressive.

In Lianyun City, fifteen or sixteen-year-old first-grade pill masters were few and far between.

At this moment, many people thought that if Mo Qingyun didn’t encounter any accidents, his future achievements in alchemy would be high, at least reaching the third or fourth grade.

Thinking this, many people looked at Mo Qingyun with a mix of admiration and interest.

A future third or fourth-grade pill master was definitely worth befriending.

"Qingyun, how did you know?"

Seeing the admiring looks from everyone around him, Mo Feilin was shocked and looked at Mo Qingyun in disbelief.

Mo Qingyun didn’t directly answer Mo Feilin’s question but smiled faintly and said, "Uncle Four, this matter is complicated. I’ll explain it to you later."

"Alright!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun didn’t want to talk about it, Mo Feilin didn’t continue asking. After all, there were outsiders present.

After responding to Mo Feilin, Mo Qingyun looked at the surprised Wu Ruo and smiled, "Aunt Four, wait for Uncle Four. He will definitely gather the dowry."

"..."

Hearing Mo Qingyun call her "Aunt Four," Wu Ruo blushed and nodded, not daring to look at Mo Feilin.

"No... Impossible. How could a country bumpkin from the countryside know alchemy?"

At this moment, Wu Qing, affected by Jiangcheng’s explosion and looking disheveled, said in shock.

As for Jiangcheng, he was knocked unconscious by the explosion and lost consciousness.

Hearing Wu Qing’s words, Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened and a cold light flashed in his eyes. He said, "Hmph! Narrow-minded. The Heavenly Soul Continent is vast; Lianyun City is just a corner of it. In some major powers, Lianyun City is considered the countryside. What right do you have to call others country bumpkins?"

The Heavenly Soul Continent was vast, and Lianyun City was just a corner of it.

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, everyone’s expressions changed, looking at the thin young man in surprise.

They didn’t expect him to say such words.

This showed that his aspirations were great; it seemed Lianyun City couldn’t hold him back.

At this moment, when everyone was shocked by Mo Qingyun’s words, a young man rushed into Hundred Herbs Pavilion excitedly.

"The Alchemy Master Alliance Guild is recruiting apprentices. Moreover, Grandmaster Zhao Qi will select one apprentice as his personal disciple from the recruited alchemy apprentices."

The young man said excitedly when he entered Hundred Herbs Pavilion, "Don’t just stand there. Hurry and try your luck. Such an opportunity doesn’t come often."

"The Alchemy Master Alliance Guild is recruiting apprentices? How can this be possible? Isn’t it only first-grade alchemy masters who have the qualifications to enter?"

"Grandmaster Zhao Qi, is he that high-grade third-level alchemy master, the highest-ranked alchemy master in Lianyun City?"

"If he’s chosen by Grandmaster Zhao Qi, it will be like a carp jumping over the dragon gate. I wonder who’s so lucky."

In an instant, the first floor of Hundred Herbs Pavilion became bustling.

"Alchemy Master Alliance Guild?"

Mo Qingyun was quite familiar with the Alchemy Master Alliance Guild; in his previous life, he was one of the major elders at headquarters.

"Who would have thought there’s a branch in Lianyun City. I can go and take a look."

After a brief surprise, Mo Qingyun frowned slightly and had an idea.

Now that the Mo Family’s foundation in Lianyun City was shallow, he needed a support. The Alchemy Master Alliance Guild seemed like a good choice.

Moreover, he needed an identity, one with weight, to facilitate his future activities in Lianyun City.

Members of the Alchemy Master Alliance Guild fit this requirement perfectly.

With this thought, Mo Qingyun no longer hesitated and said to Mo Feilin, "Uncle Four, I’ll go take a look."

"Alright!" Hearing this, Mo Feilin nodded and went with Mo Qingyun to the Alchemy Master Alliance Guild.

In Mo Feilin’s view, Mo Qingyun going to the Alchemy Master Alliance Guild was probably just trying his luck and seeing if he could become a member.

Seeing Mo Qingyun and Mo Feilin head to the Alchemy Master Alliance Guild, Wu Ruo came beside Wu Qing and asked with concern, "Sister, are you alright? Should we go back?"

"I’m fine!"

Looking at Mo Qingyun and Mo Feilin walking away, Wu Qing said coldly, "That country bumpkin also wants to become a member of the Alchemy Master Alliance Guild. We should go there too and see how he embarrasses himself in front of everyone."

Then Wu Qing and Wu Ruo also headed to the Alchemy Master Alliance Guild.

In Lianyun City, there were four major powers.

The Alchemy Master Alliance Guild was one of them and was on par with the other three major powers, the City Lord’s Mansion, Heavenly Dragon Gang, and Mount Tai Sect.

This showed that the Alchemy Master Alliance Guild had a significant influence in Lianyun City.

A meticulous person could even notice that, if considering influence alone, the Alchemy Master Alliance Guild might be the strongest among the four major powers.

After all, in this martial world, no one could guarantee they wouldn’t need medicinal pills.

The Alchemy Master Alliance Guild was located in the eastern part of Lianyun City, at its center. It covered a thousand acres.

One by one, the buildings rose from the ground, grand and magnificent, showcasing the power of the Alchemy Master Alliance Guild.

Arriving at the Alchemy Master Alliance Guild, seeing its scale, Mo Qingyun couldn’t help but sigh in his heart.

Compared to the Alchemy Master Alliance Guild, the Mo Family was too weak.

When Mo Qingyun and his companion arrived, there were already many people outside the Alchemy Master Alliance Guild.

They all looked expectant and excited, likely here to compete for the positions of alchemy apprentices recruited by the Alchemy Master Alliance Guild.

After a short while, as everyone waited eagerly, several people finally came out from the Alchemy Master Alliance Guild.

Among them was an old man who looked at the people below the steps and slowly said, "This time, our guild is breaking precedent by recruiting a hundred promising alchemy apprentices. However, there are some requirements for these hundred alchemy apprentices: first, their age must be under twenty."

Under twenty!

This requirement made half of the people look dejected; they didn’t meet this condition.

After stating the recruitment requirements, the old man ignored those who left dejectedly and continued, "Those who meet the requirements should come forward to register their names and basic information."

The old man pointed at a platform set up on the right side of the steps, where people could register their information.

About half an hour later, all those who met the requirements had registered their names and basic information.

"Hmph! This country bumpkin is indeed here to take the test for an alchemy apprentice position in the Alchemy Master Alliance Guild."

Wu Qing saw Mo Qingyun registering his information and said with displeasure.

After everyone finished registering their information, the old man took the register book in his hand and glanced at it. He said, "Now everyone stand in line; I will start calling names to test your soul strength."

At this moment, several young men behind the old man carried a white stone to everyone’s front.

The old man pointed at the white stone and said, "This is a soul-testing stone. It will reveal your soul grade; only those with middle-grade soul strength meet the requirements for this recruitment."

Soul strength had six grades: lower, middle, upper, perfect, flawless.

After the old man spoke, those remaining became tense again.

In the next round of tests, many would be eliminated based on their soul strength grade.

"When testing your soul strength grade, just walk up to the soul-testing stone and place your hand on it."

The old man looked at everyone below, who were tense, and said slowly, "Then the soul-testing stone will show different colors based on your soul strength grade. The colors are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. Red means your soul grade is below the lower grade; orange means lower grade, and so on for the six grades."

First up was Chen Zhiwei.

After hearing the old man’s call, this young man named Chen Zhiwei walked up to the soul-testing stone nervously and placed his hand on it.

Then, the color of the soul-testing stone began to change and finally settled at a light red.

Light red meant his soul strength was below the lower grade.

The old man said indifferently, "Soul grade is below the lower grade; not qualified."

Hearing this, Chen Zhiwei’s face turned pale and he left dejectedly.

Next up was Lu Dalin.

Another young man walked up, placed his hand on the soul-testing stone, and the result was red.

"Soul grade is below the lower grade; not qualified."

Hearing this, Lu Dalin’s face turned pale and he left dejectedly.

Next up was Li Cheng.

Another young man was called, walked up nervously, and placed his hand on the soul-testing stone.

Soon, a light flashed from the soul-testing stone, and its color rapidly changed before settling at orange-yellow.

Seeing this, Li Cheng’s face turned tense as he looked at the old man.

"Approaching middle grade; qualified."

Hearing this, Li Cheng’s face lit up with joy. Under the envious glances of others, he slowly walked to one side.

This continued as each young man was called up for the soul strength test.

...

After several hours, most of those who had registered their information had undergone the soul strength test.

However, only about thirty percent met the requirements.

Although only thirty percent qualified, this number was still more than a hundred.

Next up was Yue Taiven.

"Yue Taiven, he’s already a first-grade alchemy master. Who would have thought he’d come."

"Yue Taiven has a remarkable talent for alchemy and is among the top ten in Lianyun City. His soul grade should be quite high."

"Looks like Yue Taiven came for Grandmaster Zhao Qi’s personal disciple position."

...

When the old man called out Yue Taiven, everyone became excited.

Then Mo Qingyun saw a proud young man walk up slowly.

"Hello, Master Guanchuan!"

Yue Taiven walked up and first greeted the old man respectfully before looking haughty as he placed his hand on the soul-testing stone.

Immediately, the soul-testing stone shone brightly and its color rapidly changed before settling at blue-green.

"Woah! Blue-green, Yue Taiven’s talent is outstanding. His soul grade should be upper."

"Upper, the highest so far and only one of its kind."

"It looks like Grandmaster Zhao Qi’s personal disciple will be Yue Taiven."

...

Seeing Yue Taiven’s soul grade, everyone was envious.

"Soul strength upper grade."

The old man, Master Guanchuan, who had been expressionless, smiled with approval.

Then Yue Taiven walked to one side under everyone’s envious glances.

...

After a short while, another batch of people underwent the soul strength test, with only a few passing.

Next up was Mo Qingyun.

After waiting for several hours, it was finally Mo Qingyun’s turn.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun didn’t hesitate and walked towards the soul-testing stone.

When it was Mo Qingyun’s turn, Wu Qing’s face darkened because of him; she had stood there for several hours.

"I’ll see what your soul grade is. If the soul-testing stone doesn’t light up, you’re in for an embarrassment."

Wu Qing said venomously as she watched Mo Qingyun walk up.

Compared to Wu Qing, Wu Ruo was curious and wanted to know Mo Qingyun’s soul grade.

As for Mo Feilin, he clenched his fists and looked tense with anticipation, hoping Mo Qingyun would pass the test.

Under everyone’s expectations, Mo Qingyun walked up to the soul-testing stone and casually placed his hand on it.

"Hmm! This young man seems different from others."

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s casual manner, Master Guanchuan’s expression changed and he looked curious.

Usually, the more concentrated one was during a soul strength test, the better the result would be.

Someone as casual and indifferent as Mo Qingyun usually had results that were quite different from their true soul strength.

However, when Mo Qingyun placed his hand on the soul-testing stone, it shone brightly and instantly became dazzling, rapidly changing colors.

"The color is changing so fast; it’s already yellow. Is his soul strength that high?"

"Look, it changed again to green. Does this mean he’s more talented than Yue Taiven?"

"It changed again, blue; perfect grade. This guy is so gifted."

...

Seeing the rapid changes in color of the soul-testing stone, everyone was surprised.

Finally, the color settled between blue and green.

This meant Mo Qingyun’s soul strength grade was between perfect and flawless.

Seeing this, everyone was stunned as if they were looking at a monster.

Mo Qingyun’s soul strength grade was between perfect and flawless; how extraordinary did he have to be?

"No... Impossible. How could a country bumpkin from the countryside have such talent?"

Seeing this test result, Wu Qing was shocked and looked as if she had seen a ghost.

"Great! Mo Qingyun’s soul strength grade is so high. This means he has a good chance of entering the Alchemy Master Alliance Guild."

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s test result, Mo Feilin was excited and happy.

"Feilin’s nephew has such talent. Perhaps he can help Feilin. What did he say before..."

Thinking about Mo Qingyun’s words to her, Wu Ruo was excited and blushed as she looked at Mo Feilin.

In her view, if Mo Qingyun could enter the Alchemy Master Alliance Guild, he might really help them achieve their wishes.

Seeing the color on the soul-testing stone settle between blue and green,

Master Guanchuan’s expression became excited, looking at Mo Qingyun as if he had found a jade.

He knew that Mo Qingyun hadn’t concentrated his spirit earlier; otherwise, his soul strength would have been even higher.

That meant Mo Qingyun’s true soul strength grade was...

Perfect!

Yes, perfect.

Mo Qingyun’s true soul strength grade was perfect.
