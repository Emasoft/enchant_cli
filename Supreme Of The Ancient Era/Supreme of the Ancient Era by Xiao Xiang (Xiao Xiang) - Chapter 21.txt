One day later, Mo Qingyun had condensed his true energy to its limit within his body.

“Break for me!”

At this moment, the true energy condensed to its extreme in Mo Qingyun's body surged towards the boundary barrier under his control, with a force that could overturn mountains and seas.

*His*

In the violent impact of true energy, the boundary barrier, like thin paper, was instantly shattered.

With the breaking of the boundary barrier, Mo Qingyun's cultivation officially entered the True Energy Realm, and his aura instantly surged.

Upon entering the True Energy Realm, Mo Qingyun immediately felt that his strength had increased several times over.

The originally narrow meridians in his body were widened at this moment, and the dantian was thoroughly opened.

The true energy in his meridians formed a cycle with the dantian, circulating on its own.

Moreover, Mo Qingyun felt that now his true energy storage had increased nearly five times compared to before the breakthrough.

The originally almost bursting true energy in his body now only filled one-fifth of the dantian.

Upon discovering this change, Mo Qingyun no longer hesitated and began to refine the remaining half of the medicinal spirit.

Three days later, Mo Qingyun had completely refined the remaining half of the medicinal spirit.

At this moment, not only was his cultivation thoroughly stabilized, but he also reached the peak of the first level of True Energy Realm.

Seeing that his cultivation was thoroughly stabilized, Mo Qingyun stopped further enhancing his cultivation and prepared to refine martial techniques.

Five days later, in the back mountain of Jade Pavilion Manor.

*Bang bang bang...*

A rock several meters high was directly shattered into powder by Mo Qingyun's single strike.

"Perhaps even a True Energy Realm third level person couldn't withstand this punch."

Seeing the power of his single punch, Mo Qingyun wore a satisfied expression.

Now, his fist had some return to simplicity and truth, with its power increasing several times over.

After these days of cultivation, he finally refined the ninth level martial technique Ninefold Collapse to its essence.

Moreover, with his cultivation entering the True Energy Realm, the true power of Earth-grade martial techniques was truly revealed at this moment.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun felt that if he met the Three Fiends brothers now, even without using the Soul Heaven Seal as his trump card, he could easily kill them.

After refining Ninefold Collapse, Mo Qingyun began to refine the martial technique Swift Shadow Step.

As he refined Swift Shadow Step, Mo Qingyun pondered in his heart: "I have already refined Swift Shadow Step to its essence. To advance further, I must comprehend the power of the Dao."

"But the power of the Dao can only be comprehended by high-level True Energy Realm cultivators. Therefore, advancing Swift Shadow Step further seems impossible."

Thinking this, Mo Qingyun felt a headache.

However, he did not give up and continued to refine Swift Shadow Step.

Once Swift Shadow Step was activated, Mo Qingyun moved swiftly as if the wind was under his feet.

As he continuously practiced Swift Shadow Step, his speed became faster and his comprehension of the technique deeper.

"Swift Shadow Step is primarily about speed, with wind being its essence. To comprehend Swift Shadow Step to the level of power of the Dao, I must understand the power of wind."

Mo Qingyun thought deeply in his heart, and his comprehension of Swift Shadow Step became increasingly profound.

Five days later, Mo Qingyun was still refining Swift Shadow Step.

However, now Swift Shadow Step had completely changed under his cultivation.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun's steps were as leisurely as a walk in the garden, but his speed was extremely fast, almost instantaneous.

Moreover, when Mo Qingyun took a step, wind blade illusions formed around his body.

*Whizz whizz whizz...*

Under the attack of these wind blade illusions, traces of varying depths appeared on the surrounding trees.

Some smaller plants were directly cut in half by these wind blade illusions.

"Swift Shadow Step has finally reached the level of power of the Dao."

Seeing the results of Swift Shadow Step, Mo Qingyun wore an expression of wild joy and was very satisfied with this achievement.

However, he also knew clearly that this wasn't true power of the Dao.

Power of the Dao is something only high-level True Energy Realm cultivators can comprehend. His current level could only be considered pseudo-power of the Dao.

Nevertheless, Swift Shadow Step's power had increased several levels.

"Next is Dragon Fire Seal."

After refining Swift Shadow Step to the level of power of the Dao, Mo Qingyun decided to refine Dragon Fire Seal.

Then, he began refining Dragon Fire Seal and started condensing the dragon war seal of true energy.

Due to his cultivation realm, Mo Qingyun's inner strength war seals were re-condensed into true energy war seals at this moment.

After transforming the inner strength war seal into a true energy war seal, Mo Qingyun began condensing new true energy war seals.

In an instant, seven days later.

At this moment, twenty-seven crimson-colored war seals floated in the air around Mo Qingyun's body.

These twenty-seven true energy war seals were the maximum limit that Dragon Fire Seal could condense in the True Energy Realm.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun finally refined Dragon Fire Seal to its perfection.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun stored the twenty-seven true energy war seals within his body.

After refining Dragon Fire Seal, Mo Qingyun then began refining the soul technique Soul Heaven Seal.

The method of refining Soul Heaven Seal was similar to Dragon Fire Seal, both involving condensing war seals. However, the difficulty of condensing soul war seals was much greater than that of true energy war seals.

But Mo Qingyun did not give up and continued to condense them tirelessly.

After several days, Mo Qingyun stopped refining Soul Heaven Seal.

Because the next day was the Town Assembly Day, and he had to return to Mo Manor today.

However, after these days of condensing, the number of soul war seals in his sea of consciousness had reached nine.

For this achievement, Mo Qingyun was very satisfied. After a month of cultivation, his strength had gained another qualitative improvement.

Mo Qingyun now almost felt that even a mid-level True Energy Realm expert, he had the qualifications to fight with.

Chapter 77: Encounter on the Way Home()

In a small courtyard of Xue Manor in Lianyun City.

"Master Ming, we still haven't found the Three Fiends brothers."

At this moment in the courtyard, a middle-aged man reported to the young master in front of him.

"It's already been nearly a month, and there is still no news about the Three Fiends brothers. They are probably in grave danger."

Xue Ming's face was gloomy, and he said coldly: "So it seems that there might be a powerful expert protecting Mo Qingyun."

Xue Ming felt that with Mo Qingyun's strength, it was impossible for him to kill the Three Fiends brothers. They must have died at the hands of others.

"Master Ming, recently the City Lord Manor has increased the number of people protecting Jade Pavilion Manor. Do you think..."

The middle-aged man asked试探性地问道。

"It's not impossible."

Xue Ming gritted his teeth and muttered angrily: "City Lord Manor! I will definitely settle this account with them."

Thinking that it might be the people from City Lord Manor who killed the Three Fiends brothers, making his assassination of Mo Qingyun fail, Xue Ming's anger flared up.

At this moment, as the two were talking, someone hurriedly approached and reported: "Master Ming, the people who have been following Mo Qingyun just sent a message. They left Jade Pavilion Manor and seem to be preparing to leave Lianyun City."

"Leave Lianyun City?"

Xue Ming's lips curled into a sneer, and he said smugly: "Mo Qingyun, I was just worried about not finding a way to deal with you. Now you've come to me, saving me the trouble."

"Keep following them. As soon as Mo Qingyun leaves the city, report to me immediately."

Xue Ming instructed the person in front of him, and a cold light flashed in his eyes.

...

After Mo Qingyun finished cultivating, he left the courtyard and set off with Mo Xin and a few others to return to Mo Manor.

After these two months, Mo Xin and Mo Xiao's cultivation had made significant progress.

Now Mo Xin's cultivation had successfully advanced to the True Energy Realm, while Mo Xiao's cultivation reached the seventh level of Body Refinement.

After leaving Jade Pavilion Manor, the four of them came to Qingmu Trading House.

Originally Mo Feilin was going to return with them, but Qingmu Trading House had urgent matters and Mo Feilin couldn't leave.

Helplessly, the four of them could only go back by themselves.

Mo Qingyun sat in front and drove the carriage towards the city gate.

Now Mo Qingyun was a well-known figure, and as soon as he drove up, the city guards respectfully let him pass.

Their behavior was completely different from when Mo Qingyun first entered the city.

At this moment, as Mo Qingyun drove out of Lianyun City,

Beside the city gate, a dark golden carriage chased after their carriage.

About half an hour later, this dark golden carriage suddenly accelerated and overtook them.

Then it stopped across the road, blocking their path.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun frowned and his face became serious. He stared coldly at the carriage in front.

Under Mo Qingyun's gaze, five people walked out of the dark golden carriage.

Among them, the leading person was Xue Ming whom Mo Qingyun recognized.

"Xue Ming!"

Seeing Xue Ming in front, Mo Qingyun's face darkened and his expression became solemn.

He didn't expect Xue Ming to chase him all the way out of Lianyun City in order to kill him.

There was one True Energy Realm seventh level, one True Energy Realm fourth level, two True Energy Realm second levels, and Xue Ming who was half a step into the True Energy Realm.

Discovering their strength, Mo Qingyun's expression became somewhat heavy.

The disparity in power was too great. A direct confrontation definitely wouldn't work.

"Mo Qingyun, last time you侥幸escaped. This time I'll see where you run."

Xue Ming said with a cold smile.

In his view, Mo Qingyun and the others were now like fish on a chopping board, at their mercy.

However, thinking about it, the disparity in power was indeed too great.

After a brief moment of thought, Mo Qingyun said to Mo Xin behind him: "Sister Mo Xin, you drive the carriage. I'll find an opportunity to let you leave."

After saying this, Mo Qingyun got off the carriage and handed over the reins to Mo Xin.

"Mo Qingyun, you might as well surrender. Don't make a futile resistance."

Seeing Mo Qingyun get off the carriage, Xue Ming's smile became even more cold: "Don't worry, after you die, I'll take care of the beauties on your carriage. I will make sure they are well taken care of every day, ha ha."

Soul Heaven Seal

At this moment, as Xue Ming was gloating, Mo Qingyun's face darkened and he attacked them directly.

Instantly, five soul war seals streaked through the air and slammed into Xue Ming's group.

*Ah...*

Under the attack of the soul war seals, Xue Ming and his group all cried out in pain, their consciousness becoming hazy.

Swift Shadow Step

At this moment, Mo Qingyun didn't hesitate and raised his hand to grab Xue Ming.

"Protect Master Ming!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun's action, the True Energy Realm seventh level person immediately shouted in panic.

Xue Ming was a direct descendant of Xue Manor, and if something happened to him in their hands, they would definitely be unable to account for it.

"You brat, die!"

As this True Energy Realm seventh level person reminded the others, he also attacked Mo Qingyun.

But now Mo Qingyun had refined Swift Shadow Step to the level of power of the Dao, comprehending a bit of the power of wind. His speed had reached its peak.

Almost before they could react, Mo Qingyun was already beside Xue Ming and grabbed his neck with one hand.

"If you don't want him to die, stop fighting."

Mo Qingyun said coldly with a bit more strength in his grip.

"Stop... stop, you all stop fighting!"

In pain, Xue Ming's face showed panic and he shouted at the others.

Hearing Xue Ming's words, they all stopped fighting and stared coldly at Mo Qingyun.

"Mo... Mo Qingyun, what do you want?"

Under Mo Qingyun's threat, Xue Ming wore a frightened expression and said timidly: "If you dare to hurt me, the Xue Manor won't let you off. Also, if you kill me today, none of you will be able to leave."

"Is that so?"

Hearing Xue Ming's threatening words, Mo Qingyun smiled and increased the strength in his grip, saying coldly: "If I can take Xue Ming Junior with me to the grave, even if I die, it's a win for me."

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, Xue Ming's expression twitched and he said in panic: "Mo Qingyun, if... if you let me go, I promise not to bother you again."

"Really?"

Mo Qingyun smiled with amusement.

"Certainly!" Xue Ming hurriedly answered.

"Then first have them move the carriage." Mo Qingyun pointed to the carriage in front.

Hearing this, Xue Ming didn't hesitate and immediately instructed: "You all move the carriage."

"Master Ming, this..."

The others hesitated a bit.

They knew clearly that once the carriage was moved, Mo Xin and the rest would leave, making them more passive.

"Quickly, did you not hear what I said?"

Xue Ming, in his current state, clearly didn't think much. He urged them immediately.

Hearing Xue Ming's words, the others had no choice but to move the carriage aside.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun said to Mo Xin: "Sister Mo Xin, you all go first."

"Alright!"

Mo Xin responded and drove off directly.

She knew clearly that in the current situation, even if they stayed, it would only hold Mo Qingyun back.

Better to leave first and avoid becoming a burden to him.

After a moment, seeing Mo Xin and the others far away, Mo Qingyun's expression relaxed a bit.

Chapter 78: Killing Xue Ming()

Several hours later.

"Mo Qingyun, they are far away now. Can you let me go?"

At this moment, Xue Ming said with a pleading expression.

However, if observed carefully, one could clearly see that his eyes were filled with hatred when looking at Mo Qingyun.

"Let me go?"

Mo Qingyun's lips curled into a playful smile and said: "Do you think it's possible?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, Xue Ming's expression twitched and he said in panic: "Mo Qingyun, you... don't be impulsive. If you kill me, you won't escape either."

Xue Ming was worried that Mo Qingyun would take him down with him, and he didn't want to die together with Mo Qingyun.

He was a direct descendant of one of the first-rate forces in Lianyun City, with an exalted status. He didn't want to die so miserably.

"Escape?"

Mo Qingyun's playful smile became even more pronounced and said: "You overestimate them. With just a few of them, they can't hold me back."

"Brat, if you dare to harm Master Ming even a bit, we will tear you apart piece by piece."

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, the True Energy Realm seventh level person coldly shouted at him.

"Tear me apart?"

Mo Qingyun's face darkened and said coldly: "Let's see if you have the ability."

*Crack!*

As he spoke, Mo Qingyun increased his strength and crushed Xue Ming's throat bone.

"No..."

At this moment, Xue Ming widened his eyes and died with a look of disbelief.

He never thought he would die in such a way.

"Brat, you're asking for death!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun's action, the True Energy Realm seventh level person immediately leaped up and struck at him with a palm.

*Bang!*

Facing the True Energy Realm seventh level person, Mo Qingyun struck Xue Ming's back with a palm and sent his body flying towards the other.

Swift Shadow Step

Then, Mo Qingyun's feet moved like wind and he escaped.

Mo Qingyun killed Xue Ming because he knew clearly that even if he didn't kill him now, Xue Ming would seek revenge on him in the future.

Since the result was the same, he might as well kill Xue Ming and gain something from it.

"Guardian Jiang, what should we do now? Should we take Master Ming's body back?"

Seeing Xue Ming dead, the others beside him panicked and asked the True Energy Realm seventh level person.

Xue Ming was a direct descendant of Xue Manor. Being killed in front of them, they couldn't escape responsibility.

"Before we catch that brat, we can't take Master Ming's body back!"

Guardian Jiang said with a狰狞expression: "Master Ming is the nephew of the Manor's patriarch. If we can't bring that brat back to atone for his sins, we will all be buried with Master Ming when we return."

"Chase."

After briefly handling Xue Ming's body, Guardian Jiang and the others chased after Mo Qingyun.

In no time, they caught up with Mo Qingyun.

Seeing the four people chasing from behind, Mo Qingyun's expression became solemn and he thought: "This isn't a good way. If I keep using Swift Shadow Step to escape, although it can temporarily shake them off, the true energy in my body will be consumed too much. Once they catch up when I run out of true energy, I'll definitely die."

"I need to weaken their strength!"

Soon, Mo Qingyun had a plan in mind and changed his direction of escape, heading into the forest beside the main road.

Mo Qingyun's idea was that in the complex terrain of the forest, it would be advantageous for him to hide.

Moreover, with trees blocking them, it wouldn't be favorable for the others to work together against him, giving him an opportunity to kill them.

"Brat, you can't escape."

Seeing Mo Qingyun rush into the forest, Guardian Jiang and the others showed a fierce expression and gritted their teeth.

With their cultivation levels, chasing after a True Energy Realm first level brat for so long without catching him made them furious.

Although they were angry, they had to admit that Mo Qingyun's movement skills and speed were too high.

If not for Mo Qingyun's low cultivation level, they even suspected that he had comprehended the power of wind.

As time passed, Guardian Jiang and the others' hatred for Mo Qingyun grew.

Now they wished to peel his skin, draw out his bones, and cut him into pieces to vent their anger.

Since he decided to attack Guardian Jiang and the others, Mo Qingyun slowed down his pace and let them catch up.

"Brat, aren't you good at escaping? Why stop now?"

Seeing Mo Qingyun stop and be caught up by them, Guardian Jiang and the others showed a smug smile.

In their view, Mo Qingyun stopped because he couldn't run anymore.

With his True Energy Realm first level cultivation, in front of them, he was like a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.

"Escape? Why should I escape?"

Mo Qingyun's lips curled and he smiled indifferently.

"Guardian Jiang, do you think this brat has run stupid? Asking such a silly question."

"I think he knows that running is useless and plans to surrender."

"Considering this brat has self-awareness, it saves us some trouble."

The others beside Guardian Jiang showed a disdainful smile.

"Surrender?" Mo Qingyun said coolly: "You're thinking too much. To capture me, you aren't worthy."

"Brat, do you think you can escape in front of us?"

Guardian Jiang said disdainfully: "Now I give you two choices. One is to surrender and go with us to Xue Manor to face death, the other is for us to kill you and take your head back. Choose one."

"Or there's a third, which is to kill all of you and leave by myself."

Mo Qingyun looked at the four people coolly and said indifferently.

"Really laughable, Guardian Jiang, did you hear that? This brat says he will kill all of us."

"Looks like this brat has run so much that he's become stupid, saying such a foolish thing."

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, Guardian Jiang and the others laughed.

"Guardian Jiang, let me take this brat down."

After mocking Mo Qingyun a few times, one of the True Energy Realm second level people stood up and walked towards Mo Qingyun.

Hearing his words, Guardian Jiang and the others nodded in agreement, accepting his action.

In their view, it was a bit of an overkill for the four of them to deal with Mo Qingyun.

In other words, Mo Qingyun wasn't qualified for the four of them to work together against him.

Although they accepted his action, Guardian Jiang and the others still blocked Mo Qingyun's path to prevent him from escaping when he fought with the other person.

For their actions, Mo Qingyun felt a bit surprised but not unpleasantly so.

He didn't expect them to be as arrogant as the Three Fiends brothers.

This gave Mo Qingyun an opportunity to easily kill one person first.

Chapter 79: Killing Two More (Second Update)()

Seeing the True Energy Realm second level person approach, Mo Qingyun didn't hesitate and attacked him directly.

Soul Heaven Seal

A soul war seal appeared instantly, striking the True Energy Realm second level person and slamming into his head in an instant.

*Ah!*

Struck by Mo Qingyun's soul war seal, the person immediately cried out in pain and his consciousness became hazy.

Swift Shadow Step

After a successful strike, Mo Qingyun didn't hesitate and immediately activated Swift Shadow Step, raising his hand to punch the other person.

Ninefold Collapse

Mo Qingyun's fist gathered violent true energy and nine true energy fists condensed, striking the other person's head with a destructive force.

"Not good! This brat is somewhat strange. We need to act quickly."

Seeing Mo Qingyun's combat power, Guardian Jiang's expression changed and he attacked Mo Qingyun.

The other two heard Guardian Jiang's words and were alarmed, quickly attacking Mo Qingyun as well.

Dragon Fire Seal

Seeing Guardian Jiang's three people attack, Mo Qingyun raised his hand and summoned nine dragon war seals, striking the three of them.

Facing the attack of the dragon war seals, Guardian Jiang and the others paused for a moment before raising their hands to strike them.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun's nine punches landed on the head of the True Energy Realm second level person.

*Bang bang bang...*

In an instant, violent true energy fists struck the other person's head with a force that could overturn mountains and seas.

In just an instant, the True Energy Realm second level person was dead.

One strike, one True Energy Realm second level person killed!

Seeing this scene, Guardian Jiang and the others' faces instantly darkened, their eyes filled with fury.

They never expected that with their four people's strength, they would be unable to quickly subdue a True Energy Realm first level brat.

Instead, the brat killed one of them first.

This was a great humiliation for them.

"Don't hold back, let's all strike this brat down."

Seeing the change in events, Guardian Jiang didn't dare to be careless and instructed the two beside him.

"Yes, Guardian Jiang!"

Hearing Guardian Jiang's words, the two quickly responded and attacked Mo Qingyun together.

Swift Shadow Step

Seeing Guardian Jiang's three people attack simultaneously, Mo Qingyun didn't dare to be arrogant and escaped again.

At this moment, it wasn't the time for a direct confrontation. He still needed to continue weakening their strength.

"Chase!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun escape again, Guardian Jiang's expression became fierce and he shouted, chasing after him.

Guardian Jiang and the others were originally slower than Mo Qingyun in speed and movement skills. Now, with terrain interference, the gap between them widened even more.

In no time, Mo Qingyun had pulled away from them and his figure gradually disappeared from their sight.

Seeing this, Guardian Jiang's face darkened and he gritted his teeth: "Search for him. Dig up the earth to find this brat."

As they searched for Mo Qingyun, Guardian Jiang and the others separated a bit.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun returned and slowly approached the remaining True Energy Realm second level person.

But Mo Qingyun didn't act immediately. He waited for the distance between this person and Guardian Jiang's two people to increase.

After a moment, Mo Qingyun had his chance to act.

At this moment, the distance between this person and Guardian Jiang's two people had increased by several dozen meters.

At such a distance, Mo Qingyun could act on this person. Even if Guardian Jiang's two people noticed and came to rescue, it would be too late.

Soul Heaven Seal

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun didn't hesitate and raised his hand to attack the person.

Mo Qingyun struck out with a palm, a soul war seal condensed rapidly and slammed into the person in an instant.

*Puff!*

Facing the sudden attack of the soul war seal, this person hadn't reacted and was struck directly.

*Ah!*

Struck by the powerful soul war seal, this person cried out in pain and his expression became hazy.

This cry attracted Guardian Jiang's two people's attention.

"Brat, you're asking for death!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun not escape but return to hurt someone, Guardian Jiang shouted angrily.

Ninefold Collapse

As Guardian Jiang shouted, Mo Qingyun raised his hand and struck the person's head with a fist.

*Bang bang bang...*

Immediately, nine violent true energy fists struck the person's head one after another.

Under the attack of the nine true energy fists, this person's head was instantly shattered and he followed the previous person into death.

Another strike, another True Energy Realm second level person killed.

"What a cunning brat, he must have hidden his cultivation."

Seeing the True Energy Realm second level person easily killed by Mo Qingyun without much resistance, Guardian Jiang quickly guessed that Mo Qingyun must have hidden his cultivation.

Otherwise, with only True Energy Realm first level cultivation, Mo Qingyun wouldn't have such powerful combat power.

"This brat is forcing me."

Seeing another person killed by Mo Qingyun, Guardian Jiang almost went mad. His eyes were bloodshot as he roared.

At the same time, Guardian Jiang took out a black small box and pressed the button on it.

*Whizz whizz whizz...*

Then, fine needles shot out from the box and flew towards Mo Qingyun with a whistling sound.

"These are the piercing needles of Rainstorm Sealing Acupoints!"

Seeing the fine needles shot out from the box, Mo Qingyun's face changed and he exclaimed in surprise.

He didn't expect that Guardian Jiang had such a thing on him.

Once pierced by the fine needles of Rainstorm Sealing Acupoints, the acupoints in one's body would be sealed.

With the acupoints sealed, it would lead to poor circulation of qi and blood in the body. The strength one could use temporarily would be greatly reduced.

With Guardian Jiang's True Energy Realm seventh level cultivation, using the Rainstorm Sealing Acupoints on Mo Qingyun, a True Energy Realm first level person.

It showed how angry Guardian Jiang was. He wanted to kill Mo Qingyun as soon as possible.

*Puff puff puff...*

The Rainstorm Sealing Acupoints shot out and pierced the trees, making a crisp sound.

Swift Shadow Step

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun didn't dare to be careless and dodged swiftly.

At this moment, although Mo Qingyun escaped quickly, the Rainstorm Sealing Acupoints' attack range was too wide. He accidentally got hit by one needle.

*Ah!*

Struck by the Rainstorm Sealing Acupoints, Mo Qingyun let out a stifled groan and his face changed. He thought: "Bad!"

"We chase, that brat was hit by the Rainstorm Sealing Acupoints. He can't run far."

Hearing Mo Qingyun hit by a needle, Guardian Jiang showed a sneer and said coldly: "Brat, this time see where you run. For making me use the Rainstorm Sealing Acupoints, when I catch you next, I'll tear your bones one by one to vent my anger."

Feeling the power of the Rainstorm Sealing Acupoints sealing his acupoints and weakening his cultivation.

Blood surged wildly!

At this moment, Mo Qingyun no longer held back and activated the martial soul technique Blood Surging Wildly, escaping with all his might.

With the activation of the martial soul technique, his cultivation that had fallen was restored and even slightly increased.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun's expression relaxed a bit. He thought: "I was careless this time. If not for the martial soul technique Blood Surging Wildly, I might have been in trouble."

Taking a deep breath, Mo Qingyun escaped with all his strength and soon left Guardian Jiang's two people behind.

After leaving Guardian Jiang's two people, Mo Qingyun found a quiet place and began to eliminate the power of the Rainstorm Sealing Acupoints.

Chapter 80: Battle with True Energy Realm Fourth Level (Third Update)()

After a few minutes.

Under Mo Qingyun's cultivation, the Rainstorm Sealing Acupoints in his body were forced out and embedded into a tree.

After forcing out the Rainstorm Sealing Acupoints, Mo Qingyun once again cultivated his true energy and eliminated the remaining power of the needles in his body.

Mo Qingyun was only hit by one needle, so the remaining power of the needles in his body wasn't strong.

After half an hour's effort, Mo Qingyun finally eliminated all the power of the needles in his body.

However, after eliminating the power of the needles, Mo Qingyun unexpectedly found that his boundary barrier had become loose.

This meant he was about to break through!

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun's expression first showed surprise and then joy.

He didn't expect to gain a benefit from this misfortune.

Under the effect of the Rainstorm Sealing Acupoints, his originally peak True Energy Realm first level cultivation was about to break through.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun no longer hesitated and condensed his true energy within his body to prepare for the breakthrough.

About an hour later, Mo Qingyun condensed his true energy within his body to its limit.

Then he controlled the true energy in his body and began to冲击the boundary barrier.

Under the impact of the powerful true energy, the boundary barrier was easily penetrated like thin paper.

True Energy Realm second level, successfully broken through!

After breaking through to True Energy Realm second level, Mo Qingyun's strength increased several times over.

Feeling the powerful true energy flowing within his body, Mo Qingyun felt confident that he could kill those two True Energy Realm second level people directly with his hands.

Although his cultivation only increased by one level, Mo Qingyun felt that he was at least three times stronger than before.

This way, he had more chances of winning against Guardian Jiang and the other person.
