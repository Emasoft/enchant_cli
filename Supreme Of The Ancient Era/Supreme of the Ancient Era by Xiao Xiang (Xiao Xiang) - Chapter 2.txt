“After being reinforced by the琉璃石乳, my current physical strength should be comparable to that of a person at the sixth level of Body Tempering.”

Feeling his strength, Mo Qingyun revealed a satisfied expression and jumped into the bathtub to clean himself.

“After reinforcing my body with琉璃石乳, I will gain some additional capital for the upcoming monthly trial.”

Thinking of this, Mo Qingyun felt a bit of anticipation for the monthly trial two days later.

...

The next day, at Mo Family’s residence, in Mo Xin's quarters.

“Fourth Uncle, Father.”

Mo Xin walked out of her small room and greeted Mo Feipeng and Mo Feilin, who were sitting in the courtyard.

Seeing Mo Xin, Mo Feilin asked with a faint smile: “Xin'er, did Qingyun accept the琉璃石乳?”

“I gave it to him yesterday.”

Mo Xin replied and then added: “Also, when I found Qingyun at the Treasure Spirit Shop yesterday, I saw Song Zihao attacking him.”

“Song Zihao? Could he be the first among the younger generation of the Song family?”

Mo Feipeng, hearing his daughter’s words, frowned and asked with concern: “Did Qingyun get injured?”

“No, I arrived just in time.” Mo Xin said with a lingering sense of relief: “If I had been late, it would have been troublesome.”

“Good that he wasn’t injured.” Mo Feilin and Mo Feipeng both sighed with relief.

“Father, Fourth Uncle, when I talked to Qingyun yesterday, he mentioned that he was preparing a Foundation Establishment Elixir. I’m worried that he might try it himself and cause some trouble.”

Thinking of the Foundation Establishment Elixir, Mo Xin said with a worried expression.

“Nonsense! Pure nonsense!”

Hearing Mo Xin’s words, Mo Feipeng’s expression turned serious and he said sternly: “How can one casually try an elixir? We must stop him immediately.”

Then, the three of them got up and rushed towards Mo Qingyun’s residence.

...

A short while later, the three of them arrived hurriedly at Mo Qingyun's place.

“Uncle, Fourth Uncle, Sister Xin, what brings you here?”

Seeing Mo Feipeng and the others, Mo Qingyun was slightly surprised and asked them.

Relieved to see that Mo Qingyun was fine, the three of them let out a sigh of relief.

“Rascal, we had to come over. Otherwise, who knows what trouble you would have caused.”

Mo Feipeng’s expression turned stern as he scolded Mo Qingyun and reached out to him, saying: “Hand over that Foundation Establishment Elixir immediately. Can one casually try an elixir? If something happens to you, how will I explain it to your third uncle?”

“You little monkey, this time you’ve played too much. Even I can’t help you.”

Mo Feilin chuckled and looked at Mo Qingyun with affection, saying helplessly: “Foundation Establishment Elixir?”

Hearing Mo Feipeng’s words, Mo Qingyun was taken aback and understood their intentions.

Then he looked at Mo Xin. Seeing him look her way, she stuck out her tongue and said: “Qingyun, hand that Foundation Establishment Elixir to Father. You can’t casually try it.”

Seeing the three of them in front of him, Mo Qingyun revealed a bitter smile. Although he knew they were concerned about him, he felt somewhat depressed.

Thinking of himself as a Pill Sage, his little Foundation Establishment Elixir was being doubted by others. If those who knew him found out about this, they would probably be frightened to death.

“Uh, I’ve already absorbed the Foundation Establishment Elixir.” Mo Qingyun said with an innocent expression and a bit of unease.

“What! Absorbed it?”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, the three of them were taken aback.

Mo Feilin asked anxiously: “Are you feeling any discomfort?”

“Fourth Uncle, Uncle, Sister Xin, don’t worry. I’m fine.”

Mo Qingyun felt warm from Mo Feilin’s concern and smiled faintly: “In fact, after absorbing the Foundation Establishment Elixir, my cultivation has broken through to the fourth level of Body Tempering.”

Breaking through to the fourth level of Body Tempering!

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, the three of them were stunned and stared at him in disbelief.

Had he really succeeded? Did he really concoct a Foundation Establishment Elixir?

“Punch me with all your might.”

After a brief moment of daze, Mo Feipeng said excitedly.

“Alright!”

Mo Qingyun didn’t hesitate and punched Mo Feipeng with all his might.

Bang!

Feeling the force of Mo Qingyun’s punch, Mo Feipeng was visibly shocked and couldn’t calm down for a long time.

If not for knowing that Mo Feipeng was concerned about him, Mo Qingyun would have suspected that he had a special interest.

After checking over him and seeing no issues, Mo Feipeng’s face lit up with joy and he laughed: “Ha ha... Good boy, you’re truly the son of my third brother. You are indeed extraordinary.”

Seeing Mo Feipeng’s reaction, Mo Feilin asked with a worried expression: “Brother, is Qingyun really fine?”

“He’s fine. This kid has a great physique now.” Mo Feipeng waved his hand and smiled, indicating that there was no need to worry.

“So this little monkey has turned a misfortune into a blessing?” Mo Feilin said with relief.

“Technically, yes.” Mo Feipeng nodded and then his expression turned serious: “This time you were lucky. Next time, don’t casually try elixirs anymore, okay?”

“Okay, Uncle.” Mo Qingyun said with a bitter smile and nodded helplessly.

After seeing that Mo Qingyun was fine, the three of them were relieved. After giving him some instructions, Mo Feipeng and Mo Xin left.

“Little monkey, how about going for a few drinks with me?” Mo Feilin asked as he left.

“Sure.” Mo Qingyun nodded in agreement.

Then, Mo Qingyun followed Mo Feilin to a tavern in the Northern Desert Town and sat down.

After ordering some dishes and two jars of wine, Mo Feilin drank with Mo Qingyun.

“How have you been in the family recently? Has anyone bullied you? Tell me, and I’ll teach him a lesson.”

Mo Feilin said casually after taking a sip.

“I’m eating, drinking, and sleeping well. It’s good.”

Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and replied: “As for those who bullied me, let me handle them myself. It’s too embarrassing to have an adult intervene.”

“Ha ha, it’s best if you think that way.” Mo Feilin laughed.

After chatting with Mo Feilin, Mo Qingyun thought of his parents. He hadn’t seen them since he was reborn a few days ago, and he was very curious about their situation.

“Fourth Uncle, my father and mother...?”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Mo Feilin paused for a moment before saying: “Qingyun, don’t ask about your parents’ matters for now. When the time is right, we will tell you.”

Hearing Mo Feilin’s words, Mo Qingyun fell silent and didn’t ask further.

He felt that his parents’ matters were not simple.

As Mo Qingyun and Mo Feilin chatted, their relationship grew closer.

“Little monkey, the monthly trial is in two days. Do well and get a good ranking. Next time I come back from Lianyun City, I’ll bring you something nice.”

Mo Feilin took another sip of wine and encouraged Mo Qingyun.

“I will, Fourth Uncle.” Mo Qingyun said seriously, promising him.

Mo Feilin chuckled: “Haha, you seem very confident. How about this, if you get in the top ten, I’ll take you to Lianyun City next time.”

“Top ten?”

Mo Qingyun’s expression paused, then he revealed a playful smile.

The top ten wasn’t his goal. However, Mo Qingyun didn’t say much and smiled faintly at Mo Feilin: “Fourth Uncle, are you serious?”

“Of course I am. Do you think you can get into the top ten?” Mo Feilin asked with interest.

“Confidential!” Mo Qingyun chuckled.

“You little monkey, playing it cool with me.” Mo Feilin laughed and patted Mo Qingyun’s head.

Mo Qingyun teased: “Fourth Uncle, when are you going to find a fourth aunt for us?”

“Fourth Aunt?”

Mo Feilin was taken aback, then he revealed a hint of sadness and fell silent for a moment.

After a brief silence, Mo Feilin regained his composure and glared at Mo Qingyun: “You little monkey, mocking your fourth uncle. Do you want me to break your bones?”

“No... No need.” Mo Qingyun laughed nervously and waved his hand.

After chatting for a while, the two of them returned to Mo Family’s residence. After returning, they each went back to their quarters.

Mo Qingyun returned and began his cultivation, preparing for the monthly trial in two days.

...

“With my cultivation unable to advance further, I can practice martial techniques.”

After some thought, Mo Qingyun decided on his next cultivation focus.

Thinking of this, he no longer hesitated and began to choose the martial technique to practice.

“With my current cultivation level, many martial techniques are unattainable. Even if I practice attack techniques, the damage won’t be significant. Therefore, it would be better to start with agility techniques.”

After some thought, Mo Qingyun decided on his direction and planned to practice the agility technique.

According to Mo Qingyun’s thoughts, in the monthly trial sparring matches, there wouldn’t be just one match. It was a battle of endurance, so hard confrontation wasn’t the best approach; thus, agility techniques were more important.

If your opponent can't hit you, you won’t get injured and can maintain peak condition.

Martial techniques are divided into four grades: Heaven, Earth, Mystic, and Yellow.

《Disease Shadow Step》, a high-grade Mystic technique. When mastered to the extreme, it allows one to move like a shadow, making it impossible for others to escape.

“《Disease Shadow Step》, you’re the one.”

After some selection, Mo Qingyun decided to practice 《Disease Shadow Step》.

Compared to other agility techniques, 《Disease Shadow Step》 was easier to grasp and could better showcase its essence.

After deciding on the martial technique, Mo Qingyun began his practice without delay.

Step by step with wind, swift as a whirlwind, chasing the wind and catching the shadow, following like a shadow...

In the courtyard, Mo Qingyun repeatedly practiced 《Disease Shadow Step》 without tiring.

In his previous life, Mo Qingyun had mastered 《Disease Shadow Step》 to the level of essence. This time, he progressed rapidly.

Martial technique cultivation has six stages:入门 (entry), 小成 (minor perfection), 大成 (major perfection), 圆满 (perfection), 真髓 (true essence), and 奥义 (mystical meaning).

In a short while, Mo Qingyun grasped the true essence of 《Disease Shadow Step》 and performed it smoothly.

His movements were like wind and shadow, leaving only a blur in the courtyard.

Time passed quickly. Two days later...

After two days of practice, Mo Qingyun had perfected 《Disease Shadow Step》.

In addition, his cultivation also progressed slightly during these two days. Although he was still far from breaking through to the fifth level of Body Tempering, there had been significant improvement compared to two days ago.

After perfecting 《Disease Shadow Step》, Mo Qingyun also practiced an attack technique called 《Nine-layer Collapse》.

《Nine-layer Collapse》 is a lower-grade Earth technique that requires true qi to assist. Since Mo Qingyun was only at the Body Tempering realm and hadn’t condensed true qi, he had only reached the entry stage of 《Nine-layer Collapse》.

However, even at this level, its power was comparable to a lower-grade Mystic technique.

...

Today was the monthly trial day of Mo Family, testing the progress of their younger generation over a month.

As the sun rose, the training ground was already filled with people, both elders and younger generation members.

“Look over there, that’s Mo Xiao. I heard he killed a fifth-level Body Tempering beast alone a few days ago.”

“Mo Xiao is strong, but Mo Lin isn’t weak either. It’s said that he could break through to the fifth level of Body Tempering long ago but stayed at the fourth level for this monthly trial.”

“I heard Mo Hai obtained a lower-grade Mystic technique and has already reached the minor perfection stage, with extraordinary combat strength.”

...

As the younger generation entered the training ground and chatted among themselves, they discussed who had a chance to enter the top ten.

“This month’s trial has many strong young members. Several of them have the potential to break through to the fifth level of Body Tempering.”

“Compared to previous years, this year’s generation is the strongest ever. There will likely be fierce competition.”

“Mo Hai, Mo Lin, Mo Xiao, Mo Bing, and Mo Ding are all very good. They’re the top ten candidates.”

...

Seeing the younger generation in the center of the training ground, the elders on the judging platform smiled with satisfaction.

At this moment, as the crowd in the training ground was bustling, Mo Qingyun arrived at the training ground.

“Fourth Uncle, Father, all uncles and aunts.”

After arriving at the training ground, Mo Qingyun bowed to the elders on the judging platform.

“Qingyun, this month’s trial has many strong young members. Do you still have confidence in getting into the top ten?”

Seeing Mo Qingyun arrive, Mo Feilin asked with a faint smile.

“Top ten?”

Hearing Mo Feilin mention the top ten, Mo Qingyun was taken aback and paused.

The top ten wasn’t his goal.

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s expression, Mo Feilin thought he lacked confidence in the top ten and said: “Getting into the top ten is a bit difficult for you. How about this, if you get into the top fifteen, our agreement still stands.”

“Top fifteen?”

Hearing Mo Feilin’s words, Mo Qingyun was taken aback again and revealed a faint smile.

Seeing his expression, Mo Feilin thought he still lacked confidence in the top fifteen and said helplessly: “If you can’t get into the top fifteen, getting into the top twenty should be fine. If you make it to the top twenty, our agreement still stands.”

“Uh!”

Seeing Mo Feilin’s retreat, Mo Qingyun was speechless.

It seemed that Mo Feilin didn’t have much confidence in him getting into the top twenty of this month’s trial.

However, Mo Qingyun didn’t say much. He would soon prove it with his actions.

Seeing that Mo Qingyun wasn’t saying anything, Mo Feilin smiled faintly: “Soon it’s time to draw lots. Go line up and do your best.”

“Okay.”

Hearing Mo Feilin’s words, Mo Qingyun nodded and walked towards the center of the training ground.

When Mo Qingyun joined the younger generation, Mo Hai revealed a dark expression and sneered at him: “Mo Qingyun, hope you don’t meet me in the trial. Otherwise, I’ll break your legs.”

“Break my legs?”

Hearing Mo Hai’s words, Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened and he replied coldly: “You’d better not meet me. Otherwise, I’ll break your legs and hands.”

“Humph! You have a big mouth. Hope you’re as strong in battle as you are with your words.”

Mo Hai snorted and said through gritted teeth.

“Brother Hai, don’t be angry. In my opinion, Mo Qingyun won’t even make it to the top fifty.”

“Brother Hai, don’t worry. If I meet Mo Qingyun in the trial, I’ll break his legs for you.”

“Yeah, Brother Hai shouldn’t get upset over a weakling. Your goal is first place in the trial.”

...

Seeing Mo Hai’s expression, his few followers flattered him.

Mo Qingyun looked at them with a meaningful gaze and decided that if he met any of them, he wouldn’t mind teaching them a lesson.

“Everyone is here. Now we’ll draw lots to choose opponents.”

At this moment, an elder from the judging platform walked out and announced.

After hearing the elder’s words, the younger generation went to the judging platform and drew lots for their opponents.

...

After Mo Qingyun’s second trial ended, the remaining young members entered the arena for their third and fourth trials...

In this process, Mo Bing and others who were initially favored performed impressively, defeating their opponents with overwhelming power.

In this month’s trial, there were 134 ordinary young members. After the first round of trials, 67 advanced to the second round.

In this process, nine were barely victorious and couldn’t continue in the trials. Therefore, only 58 advanced to the second round.

“Rest for half an hour and then draw lots again.”

After seeing all the first-round trials end, an elder on the judging platform announced.

Half an hour later, after resting, Mo Qingyun went to the judging platform with everyone else and drew lots for his opponent.

“7!”

This time, Mo Qingyun drew number 7 and was the first to start in the second round.

Then he went to arena 7, waiting for his opponent.

To Mo Qingyun’s surprise, his opponent was another of Mo Hai’s followers, Mo Sheng.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun sighed inwardly. It was truly a narrow encounter with an enemy.

“I surrender!”

To Mo Qingyun’s surprise, this follower of Mo Hai, Mo Sheng, surrendered right at the start.

Thus, Mo Qingyun advanced easily to the third round as the first one.

However, Mo Qingyun wasn’t too surprised by Mo Sheng’s actions. He likely feared Mo Qingyun after seeing what happened to Mo Tao.

The second round had only three matches and ended quickly. In this process, 29 were eliminated.

One was barely victorious and couldn’t continue in the third round. So, only 28 advanced to the third round.

“Win once more and I’ll be in the top fifteen.”

Mo Qingyun smiled faintly, thinking to himself.

According to Mo Feilin’s words, if he won this third round, he would meet his requirements.

“Rest for half an hour and then start the third round.”

After seeing the second round end, an elder on the judging platform announced.

Half an hour later, they drew lots again.

5, in the first group to start.

Seeing his number, Mo Qingyun went straight to arena 5.

As he walked towards arena 5, a cold figure slowly approached him. This was Mo Lin, his opponent in this round.

Mo Lin was one of the top candidates for this month’s trial and could break through to the fifth level of Body Tempering at any moment.

Seeing this, everyone was on edge for Mo Qingyun. He had a tough match ahead of him.

“Mo Qingyun is really unlucky, his opponent this time is Mo Lin. He’s doomed.”

“Yes, although Mo Qingyun surprised everyone with his performance, he definitely can’t be Mo Lin’s match.”

“Originally, based on his current combat strength, he had a chance to enter the top twenty. Unfortunately, he met Mo Lin.”

...

The younger generation discussed.

“Little monkey’s opponent is Mo Lin. I wonder if he can win. It’s a bit difficult for him to defeat Mo Lin.”

Mo Feilin, seeing Mo Qingyun’s opponent was Mo Lin, frowned.

Although he knew that because of the Foundation Establishment Elixir, Mo Qingyun’s cultivation had broken through to the fourth level of Body Tempering, he wasn’t very confident in Mo Qingyun defeating Mo Lin.

“Mo Qingyun, your luck is really bad. Your opponent this time is Mo Lin, who even I don’t have absolute confidence in defeating.”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s opponent was Mo Lin, Mo Hai said with a hint of schadenfreude: “Too bad. This way, I can’t teach you a lesson myself.”

Arena 5.

As everyone was discussing, Mo Lin looked at Mo Qingyun with a cold expression and said: “You’re not my match. Summon your martial soul, otherwise you won’t even get a chance to fight.”

Hearing Mo Lin’s words, Mo Qingyun was taken aback and smiled faintly: “No need. I don’t need to summon my martial soul to deal with you.”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Mo Lin’s expression darkened and he said unhappily: “Since that’s the case, don’t blame me for not giving you a chance.”

Then Mo Qingyun saw Mo Lin move like a dragon and tiger towards him.

Mo Lin punched out, creating a whistling sound as it broke the air.

Everyone was shocked by this punch and looked at Mo Lin with awe.

Mo Lin’s punch already had the aura of a fifth-level Body Tempering expert.

“Little monkey is really overconfident. Facing Mo Lin, he didn’t even summon his martial soul. He’s courting death.”

“He’s too arrogant. I’m sure he can’t withstand Mo Lin’s punch.”

“They’re wrong, Mo Qingyun’s martial soul is a first-grade Light Soul. Summoning it would be useless.”

“That’s true.”

...

As everyone watched Mo Lin move, there was a commotion around the arena.

Bang!

Amidst everyone’s shock, a dull sound came from arena 5.

With this sound, dust rose in arena 5, enveloping Mo Qingyun and his opponent.
