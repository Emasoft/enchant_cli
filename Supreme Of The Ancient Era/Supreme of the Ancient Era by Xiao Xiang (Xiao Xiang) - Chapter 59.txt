With the addition of this pure golden force, the progress in refining his Golden Jade True Body became twice as fast.

"This is the power of the Goldstone Verdant Lotus Moss!"

Upon this discovery, Mo Qingyun's expression changed immediately, revealing a look of surprise and joy.

Immediately thereafter, Mo Qingyun began to train even more vigorously. Under his intense training, the golden jade glow became increasingly rapid.

Thus, after countless jumps of this golden jade glow, a mysterious force appeared on Mo Qingyun's body.

This was the power of the Daoist Principle.

After this round of training, Mo Qingyun actually comprehended the Golden Daoist Principle.

"Junior Master, you have actually comprehended the power of the Golden Daoist Principle."

Feeling the Daoist Principle force emanating from Mo Qingyun, Jiugong's expression changed, revealing a look of surprise.

"A True Essence Realm cultivator comprehending the Daoist Principle force; Junior Master's comprehension ability is truly strong."

Feeling Mo Qingyun’s pure Golden Daoist Principle, Jiugong's face turned solemn as he silently sighed in admiration.

Following this, Mo Qingyun maintained his training state amidst Jiugong's astonishment.

Twenty days later.

Mo Qingyun, who had been in constant training, finally opened his eyes with a look of joy, feeling extremely excited.

He had not only comprehended the Golden Daoist Principle force but also refined his Golden Jade True Body to a Daoist Principle level.

This was an unexpected harvest for him.

The consecutive breakthroughs made Mo Qingyun feel even more motivated, saying with anticipation: "Next is the Flame Sun Mountain-Cleaving Saber."

Chapter 214 - Comprehending Sword Intent (Third Update)

After Mo Qingyun spoke, he did not hesitate and immediately began training the martial technique Flame Sun Mountain-Cleaving Saber.

Then, Mo Qingyun took out his Fire Silk Saber and started practicing, continuously slashing out astonishing sword beams.

With each slash Mo Qingyun made, a powerful Fire Daoist Principle was infused into the sword beams.

"Fire Daoist Principle!"

Sensing Mo Qingyun's Fire Daoist Principle in the sword beams, Jiugong’s expression changed again, his shock intensifying.

At merely True Essence Realm Fourth Level cultivation, Mo Qingyun had comprehended two Daoist Principle forces; this was truly astonishing.

Even in the Barbarian Continent, he could be considered a genius.

Following this, Mo Qingyun continued to practice the sword technique amidst Jiugong's astonishment.

As Mo Qingyun practiced tirelessly, his comprehension of the Flame Sun Mountain-Cleaving Saber became increasingly profound.

The Daoist Principle force in his sword beams became more refined and powerful, becoming even more effortless to control.

With this feeling, Mo Qingyun was intoxicated, subconsciously closing his eyes and wielding the Fire Silk Saber freely.

At this moment, although Mo Qingyun had closed his eyes, the气势 of the sword beams he wielded became even more powerful.

"Fire Daoist Principle Second Level, with a hint of sword intent."

Sensing the change in Mo Qingyun's aura, Jiugong widened his eyes in shock.

Upon this discovery, Jiugong’s gaze towards Mo Qingyun changed again, exclaiming in fear: "What is Junior Master's true identity? Although the Sky Soul Clan is powerful, their comprehension ability does not seem as terrifying as Junior Master's."

At this moment, Jiugong felt a strong curiosity and doubt.

Thus, in the blink of an eye, ten more days passed.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun, who had been in a wondrous state, slowly opened his eyes with an expression of wild joy: "Fire Daoist Principle Third Level, initial insight into sword intent."

Compared to the improvement in Daoist Principle force, Mo Qingyun was most delighted that he had comprehended a hint of sword intent.

Sword Intent is different from Daoist Principle and power force; it is a kind of comprehension, an understanding of the aura.

Based on the depth of one's comprehension of Sword Intent, it is divided into six levels: Initial Insight, Small Achievement, Entering the Hall, Reaching the Peak, Returning to Simplicity, and Unity with Heaven.

Upon reaching the highest level of Unity with Heaven, one can borrow the power of heaven and earth to crush enemies even if standing still.

"Only the Fiercebird Break left."

Mo Qingyun put away his Fire Silk Saber and began training the martial technique Fiercebird Break, walking within the Time Shift Array.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun's steps were sometimes quick and sometimes slow, heavy at times and light at others, the entire movement extremely mysterious.

In addition, as Mo Qingyun walked, a mysterious force emanated from his body; this was the Wind Daoist Principle.

"Wind Daoist Principle!"

Sensing Mo Qingyun's Wind Daoist Principle, Jiugong was almost stunned.

How extraordinary!

At merely True Essence Realm cultivation, he had comprehended three Daoist Principle forces, and one of them was at the Third Level.

Not only that, but besides Daoist Principle force, Mo Qingyun had also comprehended a hint of Sword Intent.

This comprehension ability seemed too beastly.

At this moment, Jiugong was almost driven mad; if Mo Qingyun were not his master, he would have dissected him to study.

However, as Jiugong was in shock, Mo Qingyun's aura suddenly surged, and that mysterious force became even stronger.

Second Level Wind Daoist Principle!

Upon this discovery, Jiugong was instantly stunned, not knowing what to say.

He had been thoroughly convinced by Mo Qingyun's comprehension ability.

Another ten days passed.

Mo Qingyun finally stopped training, and the martial technique Fiercebird Break had also been refined to a Daoist Principle level.

What Mo Qingyun regretted was that although Fiercebird Break had been refined to a Daoist Principle level, the Wind Daoist Principle was still at the Second Level.

However, Mo Qingyun did not overly concern himself with it; Daoist Principle force mainly relied on natural progression, and one could not be too hasty.

"Considering the time, I have been training for about ten days. Wonder how Ling Luo and others are doing."

Mo Qingyun silently calculated, wanting to see the progress of Ling Luo's training.

Thinking this, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and instructed Jiugong: "Jiugong, remove the Time Shift Array."

"Yes, Junior Master!"

Upon hearing Mo Qingyun's instructions, Jiugong did not hesitate and immediately removed the Time Shift Array.

After Jiugong removed the array, Mo Qingyun left the stone room and headed towards Ling Luo's training place.

...

At this moment, as Mo Qingyun was heading to Ling Luo and others' training location,

Outside Jiugong's Cave.

Lei Hao saw that Mo Qingyun and others had not come out after waiting for over ten days, revealing a look of anxiety. He said to Eagle Star beside him: "Brother Eagle Star, these guys have been in there for so long without coming out. Could they really be dead inside?"

"Brother Lei Hao, your worry is possible."

Hearing Lei Hao's words, Eagle Star revealed a mischievous smile and coldly said: "But think about it from their perspective. If they are not dead, wouldn't that mean the treasures in Jiugong's Secret Treasure are so numerous that they are taking longer to come out?"

Hearing Eagle Star’s words, Lei Hao immediately revealed a look of joy and smiled: "Brother Eagle Star is considerate. So, no matter what the result is, Jiugong's Secret Treasure must be extraordinary."

Thinking this, Lei Hao and others became even more covetous of Jiugong's Secret Treasure.

After a brief moment of joy, Lei Hao saw more people arriving and said with concern: "Brother Eagle Star, as the news of Jiugong's Secret Treasure spreads, more and more kingdoms are arriving. It will be troublesome for us to compete for the treasure."

During this period, as Mo Qingyun and others did not come out, news of Jiugong's Secret Treasure spread widely, with more people knowing about it.

Consequently, the number of people arriving at Jiugong's Secret Treasure increased significantly.

Now outside Jiugong's Secret Treasure, nearly a hundred kingdoms had arrived, with thousands of people.

Facing such a large crowd and competition, Lei Hao's concern was understandable.

After all, although his kingdom’s strength was not weak, it would be impossible for him to intimidate nearly a hundred kingdoms with just his kingdom's strength.

Hearing Lei Hao’s words, Eagle Star revealed a calm smile and said indifferently: "Brother Lei Hao, don’t worry. Below just informed me that Eagle Peak Prince is arriving soon. Once he arrives, these small kingdoms around us will be no threat."

"Eagle Peak Prince is also coming?"

Hearing Eagle Star’s words, Lei Hao immediately revealed a look of joy and the worry on his face vanished.

According to him, Eagle Peak was an existence at True Essence Realm Eighth Level peak and had a Tier Eleven first-rate martial soul, the Heaven-Shaking Lion.

With such an existence arriving, those from small kingdoms could indeed be ignored.

"That's right!"

Hearing Lei Hao’s words, Eagle Star revealed a calm smile and said: "Not only that, but also accompanying Eagle Peak Prince is an expert from Sword Kingdom. Even if those guys died in Jiugong's Secret Treasure, we can work together to break the entrance."

"Sword Kingdom!"

Hearing Eagle Star’s words, Lei Hao's expression twitched and he became even more shocked.

Sword Kingdom was one of the top ten powerful kingdoms. He did not expect someone from Sword Kingdom to accompany Eagle Peak.

"You better pray that you died in Jiugong's Secret Treasure."

Upon this discovery, Lei Hao became excited and revealed a cold smile as he looked at Jiugong's Secret Treasure: "Otherwise, if you fall into my hands, I will flay and disembowel you, making your life miserable. You’ll know the consequences of offending our Lei Kingdom."

"Lord Lei Hao, with Eagle Peak Lord and that expert from Sword Kingdom arriving, this time it will be foolproof."

At this moment, after Lei Hao’s cold words, Ma Jue beside him smiled and flattered: "I wish Lord Lei Hao success."

"Good, success!"

Hearing Ma Jue’s words, Lei Hao laughed loudly and said: "With you two horses here, this time it will be foolproof. Ha ha."

"Brother Lei Hao, Eagle Peak Lord is here!"

At this moment, as Lei Hao laughed loudly, Eagle Star beside him reminded him.

Then, Lei Hao saw a young man wearing a crown and golden robe walking over with a cold and proud expression.

This should be the Eagle Peak mentioned by Eagle Star.

Beside him stood a young man in green robes, carrying a long sword on his back.

This youth arrived with an arrogant gaze sweeping around, looking at everything as if nothing mattered.

Seeing this young man, everyone quickly guessed his identity; he should be from Sword Kingdom.

Upon seeing this, Lei Hao and others did not hesitate and immediately greeted Eagle Peak and the others.

Chapter 215 - The Tyrannical Eagle Kingdom (Request for First Subscription)

"Eagle Peak Brother!"

"Eagle Peak Prince!"

As Lei Hao and others approached Eagle Peak, they all revealed a look of awe and greeted him.

"Hmm!"

Seeing everyone's actions, Eagle Peak nodded coldly in response.

Then, he glanced at the people from various kingdoms around and instructed his followers: "Clear out those around."

"Yes, Eagle Peak Prince!"

Hearing Eagle Peak’s words, the few people nodded and went to drive away those from various kingdoms.

After instructing his followers, Eagle Peak looked at the sword-carrying youth beside him and politely said: "Brother White Xiang, let's go."

"Alright!"

Hearing this, White Xiang nodded and continued walking towards Jiugong's Secret Treasure with a haughty expression.

As Eagle Peak and the others walked forward, there was immediate commotion around them as everyone expressed strong dissatisfaction with Eagle Kingdom's actions.

"What does your Eagle Kingdom mean by this? The treasures should go to those who have a connection with them. Your actions are too domineering."

"That's right, Jiugong's Secret Treasure should be shared by all of us. What gives your Eagle Kingdom the right to claim it for themselves? It's too tyrannical."

"Don't be afraid, let's unite and fight against Eagle Kingdom. Even if they are powerful, they can't be a match for nearly a hundred kingdoms."

"That's right, let's unite and fight against Eagle Kingdom. We won't compromise."

...

Facing Eagle Kingdom’s actions, the people from various kingdoms all expressed dissatisfaction.

However, they did not think that Jiugong's Secret Treasure had already been obtained by Mo Qingyun.

The treasures they were talking about were now someone else's. Compared to Eagle Peak and the others, they were just fifty steps laughing at a hundred.

Hearing everyone's dissatisfaction, Eagle Peak’s expression darkened and he pointed at one of the kingdoms: "Kill them all."

"Yes, Eagle Peak Prince!"

Hearing Eagle Peak’s words, the people from Eagle Kingdom immediately responded and attacked the kingdom he pointed at.

"You... what are you doing?"

Seeing Eagle Kingdom’s people attacking, those from the kingdom revealed a look of fear.

As for the other kingdoms nearby, they immediately retreated far away, fearing to be caught in the crossfire.

Seeing everyone retreat, those from the kingdom turned ashen-faced.

They did not expect that the people from other kingdoms would be so shameless.

Just now, they all said they would unite to fight against Eagle Kingdom, but in a blink of an eye, they turned on each other.

Without the help from surrounding kingdoms, those with True Essence Realm Second and Third Level cultivation were easily slaughtered by Eagle Kingdom’s people.

"Which kingdom is still unhappy with our actions?"

Seeing his subordinates kill those from the kingdom, Eagle Peak revealed a proud expression and scanned around.

Seeing Eagle Peak’s gaze, some people from weaker kingdoms immediately retreated in awe, fearing to be targeted.

Seeing everyone's reaction, Eagle Peak revealed a disdainful expression and said: "A bunch of weaklings!"

After saying this, Eagle Peak walked towards Jiugong's Secret Treasure and said to the sword-carrying youth beside him: "Brother White Xiang, let's break open Jiugong's Secret Treasure entrance."

"Eagle Peak Brother, wait a moment."

Hearing Eagle Peak’s words, White Xiang raised his hand to stop him and looked around coldly: "You lowly kingdom scum, get a thousand meters away from here. Otherwise, don't blame me for being ruthless with my sword."

Lowly kingdom scum, get a thousand meters away?

Hearing White Xiang’s words, everyone's expressions changed and they revealed angry looks.

This guy was too arrogant, even more so than Eagle Peak, domineering and excessive.

Then, the people from various kingdoms revealed angry looks and expressed their dissatisfaction.

"What are you, a little punk? Do we have to retreat just because you say so?"

"That's right, some unknown punk thinks he can boss us around."

"Little punk, don't think you can show off just because you're with Eagle Peak. Do you believe I'll kill you now?"

"Little punk, let me tell you the truth. If it weren't for Eagle Peak's face, you would have died a thousand times just from your words."

"Move aside or I'll finish you off. Do you believe me?"

...

For a moment, various disdainful words came from the people of different kingdoms.

Hearing everyone’s words, White Xiang's expression darkened and he said coldly: "Scum, die!"

With his words, White Xiang moved like a flying goose and leaped up, slashing out with his sword.

*Whizz*

White Xiang’s slash created a half-moon-shaped sword beam that swept out rapidly.

Where the sword beam passed, sand and stones flew, grasses were severed, carrying a shocking gust of wind.

So powerful!

Facing White Xiang’s slash, those targeted revealed fearful expressions.

White Xiang's strength far exceeded their expectations.

From his current display of power, White Xiang’s cultivation might have reached True Essence Realm Ninth Level.

Such a person was not to be trifled with.

At this moment, they seemed to have misjudged; the young man beside Eagle Peak was a true powerhouse.

*Pfft*

Facing White Xiang’s slash, some with weaker cultivation were instantly killed without resistance.

In no time, dozens of corpses lay on the ground, blood staining the earth red.

Seeing this scene, everyone’s pupils constricted and they looked at White Xiang with fear, retreating subconsciously.

Soon, the people from various kingdoms retreated to a thousand meters away in awe.

"Haha, Brother White Xiang is truly formidable!"

Seeing White Xiang’s move, Eagle Peak revealed a calm smile and said admiringly.

"Brother Eagle Peak, dealing with these scum doesn’t require too much courtesy. They are naturally lowly."

White Xiang responded indifferently and walked towards Jiugong's Secret Treasure, saying: "Let’s break the entrance."

"Alright!"

Hearing this, Eagle Peak smiled and walked with White Xiang towards Jiugong's Secret Treasure entrance to break it open.

At this moment, as White Xiang and the others approached Jiugong's Secret Treasure entrance, a few people from various kingdoms revealed cold smiles and said: "Mo Qingyun, with this terrifying guy here, you’re doomed. This is the price of offending our Du Family."

Indeed, these people hiding in the crowd were from the Du Family of Xia Kingdom.

"Brother White Xiang and Eagle Peak are truly tyrannical!"

Seeing the front of Eagle Peak and White Xiang, Lei Hao’s expression became uneasy as a hint of worry rose in his heart.

From their current attitude, if they obtained the treasure next, it might not be shared equally with him.

Or perhaps he wouldn’t get anything at all?

Thinking this, Lei Hao’s expression became even more grim as he clenched his fists and gritted his teeth: "Little punk, even if I get nothing, when you fall into my hands next, I’ll tear you to pieces."

From this, one could see how intense Lei Hao’s hatred for Mo Qingyun was.

Mo Qingyun and the others were unaware of what was happening outside.

...

At this moment, inside Jiugong's Secret Treasure.

After Mo Qingyun left the secret room, he arrived at Ling Luo and others’ training place. They had already finished their cultivation and gathered together.

From their looks, they seemed to be discussing something.

"Brother Mo, you’re here!"

"Boss, you’re here!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun arrive, Ling Luo and the others revealed calm smiles and greeted him.

As Ling Luo and the others greeted Mo Qingyun, he released his soul force to sense their cultivation levels.

After sensing them, Mo Qingyun discovered that Ling Luo and the others had all successfully advanced to True Essence Realm Fifth Level.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun revealed a faint smile and was satisfied with their progress.

Then, without hesitation, he said to everyone: "Since you’re all done training, let’s leave Jiugong's Secret Treasure."

With his words, Mo Qingyun stood up first and walked towards the entrance of Jiugong's Secret Treasure.

"Alright!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Ling Luo and the others nodded and followed him out of Jiugong's Secret Treasure.

Chapter 216 - Ling Luo’s Identity (Second Update Requesting Subscription)

Outside Jiugong's Secret Treasure!

*Boom Boom Boom*

Under Eagle Peak’s frenzied attacks, Jiugong's Secret Treasure entrance emitted loud sounds.

However, to Eagle Peak’s frustration, no matter how hard they attacked, the entrance remained unscathed.

Seeing this, Eagle Peak’s expression darkened slightly.

The sturdiness of Jiugong's Secret Treasure entrance exceeded their expectations, unlike ordinary secret treasures in the Hundred Kingdom Battlefield.

"From this, it seems Jiugong's Secret Treasure is extraordinary."

Eagle Peak frowned and said greedily: "There must be many treasures inside such a secret treasure."

Hearing Eagle Peak’s words, Lei Hao frowned and said worriedly: "But this entrance of Jiugong's Secret Treasure is so sturdy. How can we break it open?"

"Brother Lei Hao, don’t worry about this!"

Hearing Lei Hao’s words, Eagle Peak’s expression darkened and he looked around coldly: "There are many laborers here. Let them continuously attack Jiugong's Secret Treasure entrance until the array force is exhausted, and then it will break open naturally."

Hearing Eagle Peak’s idea, Lei Hao’s eyes lit up and he revealed a look of joy: "Brother Eagle Peak, you’re right!"

Hearing Lei Hao’s praise, Eagle Peak’s smile became even more cold as he said to his followers: "Go and capture some people to attack the entrance array."

"Yes, Eagle Peak Prince!"

Hearing Eagle Peak’s command, his guards nodded and prepared to capture people to attack the array.

Just as they were about to move, Jiugong's Secret Treasure entrance suddenly glowed.

The array opened!

Then, everyone saw five figures appear in their sight.

Seeing these five people emerge, the Ma Jue brothers immediately lit up and said to Lei Hao and others with a cold smile: "Your Excellencies, they’re out. That little punk is the one who obtained the ancient treasure."

As Ma Jue spoke, he pointed at Mo Qingyun.

Hearing Ma Jue’s words, Lei Hao and the others revealed cold smiles and looked at Mo Qingyun with mocking eyes.

At this moment, in their eyes, Mo Qingyun and the others were like fish on a chopping board, ready to be slaughtered.

However, thinking about it, Mo Qingyun and the others’ combat strength was indeed too far behind them.

"Mo Qingyun, you’re looking for death. You actually came out of Jiugong's Secret Treasure."

As Ma Jue revealed a cold smile, the Du Family people from various kingdoms also revealed cold smiles.

"Those guys are out. Wonder what treasures they obtained in Jiugong's Secret Treasure."

"The array of Jiugong's Secret Treasure is so sturdy; it must be a cultivation cave of a powerful person. There must be treasures inside."

"Just with Eagle Kingdom’s people here, even if these five obtain the treasure next, it won’t be our turn."

"Shh! Speak softly. Don’t let them hear you. Didn’t you see the fate of Jade Kingdom?"

"Best if they kill each other, then we can gain a windfall."

...

Seeing Mo Qingyun and the others appear, everyone’s expressions changed as they expressed their thoughts.

As people whispered to each other, Mo Qingyun and the others saw the scene before them clearly.

Seeing this array of people, Mo Qingyun and the others were slightly stunned, somewhat surprised by the scene.

They did not expect so many people to be outside Jiugong's Secret Treasure now.

Could it be that news of Jiugong’s Secret Treasure had leaked?

After a brief moment, Mo Qingyun and the others’ minds unconsciously thought this.

In their view, if not for this, how could so many people be outside Jiugong's Secret Treasure?

Who leaked the news of Jiugong’s Secret Treasure?

At this moment, Mo Qingyun and the others’ expressions were solemn as they pondered.

As Mo Qingyun and the others thought, Ma Jue beside them revealed a smug smile and said coldly to Mo Qingyun: "Little punk, didn’t you expect so many people would be waiting for you outside Jiugong's Secret Treasure?"

Ma Jue!

Seeing Ma Jue, Mo Qingyun and the others’ expressions changed, their faces darkening slightly.

At this moment, they finally understood why so many people were outside Jiugong's Secret Treasure.

It was these two guys’ doing!

Seeing this, Ling Luo revealed a look of anger and shouted at Ma Jue: "You two flatterers, Boss was kind enough to spare your lives. No, horse lives. You didn’t take care of yourselves and even plotted against us."

"Ma Jue, you two are too much."

At this moment, not only Ling Luo was furious but even Long Yitian revealed a look of anger.

"Hmph! Big talk, no wonder you dared to provoke our Lei Kingdom."

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Lei Hao’s expression darkened and he said angrily: "Little punk, you killed our people. We should settle the score with you. If you’re smart, kill yourself; otherwise, I can’t guarantee if you’ll have a complete body."

"Ling Luo, stop talking nonsense. How could I let my boss kill himself because of you?"

Hearing Lei Hao’s words, Ling Luo rolled his eyes and said disdainfully: "Last time the beast horde you caused was quite a taste, huh? Didn’t expect your life to be so tenacious and survive the beast horde."

"Little punk, it’s you!"

Hearing Ling Luo’s words, Lei Hao’s expression darkened and he recognized Ling Luo, gritting his teeth: "I’ll kill you first to vent my anger."

Last time because of Ling Luo’s actions, their Lei Kingdom suffered heavy losses.

Thinking about this, Lei Hao was furious.

Now seeing Ling Luo again, his anger exploded like a bomb.

However, to everyone’s surprise, as Lei Hao moved towards Ling Luo, White Xiang suddenly said: "Lei Hao Brother, hold on!"

Then, White Xiang moved and stopped Lei Hao’s action.

"Brother White Xiang, what do you mean?"

Seeing White Xiang’s move, Lei Hao’s expression changed and revealed a hint of displeasure.

However, due to White Xiang’s strength, he did not dare show it and was only slightly angry in his heart.

However, White Xiang did not respond to Lei Hao’s words but looked at Ling Luo in surprise and exclaimed: "Nine Prince, you’re actually here in the Hundred Kingdom Battlefield!"

Nine Prince?

Hearing White Xiang’s words, everyone’s expressions changed and they were surprised by Ling Luo’s identity.

Ling Luo was actually the Ninth Prince of Sword Kingdom, a significant identity indeed.

"Boss, everyone, I’m sorry for not telling you my true identity."

Seeing Mo Qingyun and the others looking at him, Ling Luo revealed a look of apology and said awkwardly: "My true identity is actually the Ninth Prince of Sword Kingdom. I came to the Hundred Kingdom Battlefield secretly a year ago, so Sword Kingdom doesn’t know."

Hearing Ling Luo’s words, Long Yitian and the others revealed a look of苦笑, as if they could relate.

Seeing their expressions, Ling Luo immediately understood and exclaimed: "No... you guys are too!"

"Haha!"

Hearing this, Long Yitian and the others laughed and did not directly answer but said calmly: "Don’t worry, we’re happy to have a prince brother. Ninth Prince, please take care of us in the future!"

"Damn it!"

Seeing Long Fangliang and the others’ expressions, Ling Luo immediately felt that their identities were not inferior to his.

Then, he rolled his eyes and said: "Stop it. If I’m not wrong, your identities are no less than mine."

"Ninth Prince, this matter has nothing to do with you. Please don’t get involved,"

At this moment, as Ling Luo and the others talked, White Xiang beside them said coldly: "Ninth Prince, please step aside. I can’t guarantee that I won’t accidentally injure you when I act."

"Impossible!"

Hearing White Xiang’s words, Ling Luo looked at him disdainfully and said: "I know you’re the Third Prince’s man. Now I order you to help me eliminate this guy."

Ling Luo pointed at Lei Hao beside him. Seeing Ling Luo’s move, Lei Hao’s expression twitched.

He did not expect the situation to develop this way.

Then, he looked at White Xiang seriously and waited for his move, his heart pounding.

He had seen White Xiang’s strength just now; he was definitely not a match for him.

However, to Lei Hao’s relief, White Xiang did not immediately act upon Ling Luo’s words.

Seeing this, Lei Hao’s expression relaxed slightly.

"Ninth Prince, please forgive me for being rude. I can’t agree to your request."

White Xiang said coldly and added: "I came here at the Third Prince’s command to assist Eagle Peak in obtaining Jiugong's Secret Treasure. Since I met you here, please accompany me to see the Third Prince."
