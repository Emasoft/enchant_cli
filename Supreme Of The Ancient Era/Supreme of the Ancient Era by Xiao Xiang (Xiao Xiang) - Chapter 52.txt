When that streak of light appeared, Mo Qingyun sensed it and pulled Ling Luo beside him, quickly dodging to the side.

Boom!

After Mo Qingyun and Ling Luo moved away, that streak of light struck where they had been standing, blasting a large crater in the ground.

"This... This is an Eye Demon of the Battlefield. Run!"

Seeing this, Ling Luo's expression changed dramatically, showing a look of panic.

At that moment, he was completely different from his earlier cheerful demeanor; it seemed he truly feared the Eye Demon of the Battlefield.

"Eye Demon of the Battlefield?"

Hearing Ling Luo's words, Mo Qingyun looked puzzled and curious, raising his head to look ahead.

Upon looking, a giant eyeball with wings entered Mo Qingyun's line of sight.

Below this eyeball were many tentacles that kept wriggling, making one feel nauseous and anxious.

"This is...?"

Seeing this Eye Demon of the Battlefield, Mo Qingyun's expression changed in surprise. Then, a look of joy appeared on his face as he exclaimed excitedly: "Eye Demon! I never thought I would encounter such a thing here."

"This place must have close ties with that other location."

Having this discovery, Mo Qingyun immediately had a definite answer in his heart.

For he had seen the same situation at that other place, though those evil demons were not in eyeball form like this one.

They had wings and upper bodies, called Body Demons by them.

"Brother Mo, run! The Eye Demon of the Battlefield is very terrifying. It can bewitch people's minds; if you don't run, it will be too late."

When Mo Qingyun was filled with joy, Ling Luo's expression turned anxious and urged him.

From the look on Ling Luo’s face, he almost wanted to drag Mo Qingyun away.

However, when Ling Luo was anxiously worried, he was shocked to see that Mo Qingyun was running towards the Eye Demon of the Battlefield.

"Damn, is this guy crazy?"

Seeing Mo Qingyun's actions, Ling Luo was about to go mad and blurted out a curse: "Alright, I'll take my chances today. Hope you don't get too bewitched by the Eye Demon of the Battlefield."

After uttering those words, Ling Luo chased after Mo Qingyun.

In his view, Mo Qingyun's unusual actions might be due to being bewitched by the Eye Demon of the Battlefield.

Chapter 192: Killing the Eye Demon of the Battlefield (Third Update)

Squeak squeak...

As Mo Qingyun approached the Eye Demon of the Battlefield, it rapidly flapped its wings and flew into the air.

After flying up in the air, a beam of light flashed from its pupil and shot out.

This streak of light rapidly approached Mo Qingyun, reaching his eyes in an instant.

"Such a fast speed!"

Seeing this sudden attack, Mo Qingyun's expression changed, his heart filled with shock: "Moreover, this attack contains both soul force and essence power. This kind of attack is so strange."

Soul Heaven Seal

After a brief moment of surprise, Mo Qingyun no longer hesitated and immediately summoned the Soul Battle Seal to block that streak of light.

Sizzle...

After blocking that streak of light with the Soul Battle Seal, a dazzling glow burst from it, flames spreading.

Under the impact of the Soul Battle Seal, the aura of that streak of light weakened considerably.

But to Mo Qingyun's surprise, under the impact of the Soul Battle Seal, the essence power in that streak of light was not affected at all.

Then, the remaining essence power in that streak of light pierced through the Soul Battle Seal and continued to rush towards Mo Qingyun.

"The Soul Battle Seal only blocked the soul force in that streak of light!"

Having this discovery, Mo Qingyun's expression changed and he quickly pondered: "Could it be that the essence power in this streak of light must be countered with essence power attacks?"

Flame Dragon Seal

Thinking this, Mo Qingyun no longer hesitated and immediately summoned a Flame Dragon Battle Seal to verify his thoughts.

Soon, a miniature dragon appeared before Mo Qingyun and transformed into a seal, heading towards the streak of essence power.

Bang!

When that streak of essence power struck the Flame Dragon Battle Seal, a muffled sound echoed, like a steel pipe hitting an iron door.

After that loud sound, the streak of light was finally blocked and dissipated in the world.

"Damn, Mo Qingyun actually managed to counteract the Eye Demon of the Battlefield's attack!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun dispel the Eye Demon of the Battlefield’s strike, Ling Luo behind him widened his eyes in disbelief.

In the Hundred Kingdoms Battlefield, a being that made everyone change color at its name was actually helpless against Mo Qingyun.

This scene was too shocking and unbelievable for Ling Luo.

At that moment, as Ling Luo showed a look of shock, the Eye Demon of the Battlefield began to turn and flee.

For it sensed that Mo Qingyun was not someone it could handle.

Seeing the Eye Demon of the Battlefield turn and run, Ling Luo instantly panicked and exclaimed: "Damn, too impressive! The Eye Demon of the Battlefield was actually driven back by him."

However, before Ling Luo could recover from his shock, he saw Mo Qingyun chasing after the Eye Demon of the Battlefield.

Mo Qingyun was actually pursuing the Eye Demon of the Battlefield?

"Am I seeing things? This guy is chasing after the Eye Demon of the Battlefield?"

Looking at Mo Qingyun pursuing the Eye Demon of the Battlefield, Ling Luo rubbed his eyes hard, thinking he was mistaken.

But soon he realized that he wasn't wrong; Mo Qingyun really was pursuing the Eye Demon of the Battlefield.

Having this discovery, Ling Luo was completely dumbfounded and couldn't accept it.

A being that made everyone change color at its name, actually had someone daring to chase after it; this was too fierce.

Moreover, he was just a newcomer to the Battlefield with only True Essence Realm First Stage cultivation.

Was there anything more absurd than this?

"Is this Eye Demon of the Battlefield a fake? It was actually driven away by someone who just entered the Battlefield."

After being stunned for a moment, Ling Luo muttered in frustration and followed Mo Qingyun.

He wanted to see if Mo Qingyun could handle this Eye Demon of the Battlefield.

Step on Snow Without Trace

As Ling Luo moved, he turned into a blur and chased after Mo Qingyun rapidly.

When Ling Luo caught up, Mo Qingyun had already closed the distance with the Eye Demon of the Battlefield and was right below it.

Seeing Mo Qingyun approach, a beam of light flashed from the Eye Demon's pupil and shot towards him rapidly.

Soul Heaven Seal

Flame Dragon Seal

With the previous experience, Mo Qingyun handled the Eye Demon of the Battlefield's attack much more easily this time, his actions smooth and fluid.

Soon, a Soul Battle Seal and a Flame Dragon Battle Seal appeared before Mo Qingyun, heading towards the streak of light.

Bang bang...

Under the coordination of the Soul Battle Seal and Flame Dragon Battle Seal, Mo Qingyun easily dispelled the Eye Demon's attack.

After dispelling that strike from the Eye Demon of the Battlefield, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and immediately retaliated.

Fierce Bird Break

Then, Mo Qingyun leaped up into the air and came above the Eye Demon of the Battlefield.

Gravity Suppression!

Above the Eye Demon, Mo Qingyun released the Earth's Essence and suppressed it with gravity.

Under this suppression, the Eye Demon stumbled, unable to maintain balance as it fell towards the ground.

Furnace Sun Mountain-Splitting Saber

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun immediately took out his Fire Silk Saber and slashed at the Eye Demon.

As Mo Qingyun slashed, a ten-meter-long blade of light burst from his saber, like a fire dragon.

Chirp!

Seeing the blade of light coming, the Eye Demon let out a terrified cry and rapidly flapped its wings to dodge.

"Want to hide? Your movements are too slow!"

Seeing the Eye Demon's actions, Mo Qingyun flicked his wrist and changed from a slash to a sweep, directly sweeping the blade of light across its body.

Sizzle!

As the blade of light swept past, a bloodstain appeared on the Eye Demon's pupil and its wings were severed.

Plop!

Without its wings, the Eye Demon fell from the sky like a metal ball onto the ground.

After falling to the ground, its body twitched rapidly and blood flowed from its wounds.

Soon, the aura of the Eye Demon dissipated; it was killed by Mo Qingyun.

"This... This guy, he... He actually killed the Eye Demon of the Battlefield!"

Seeing this, Ling Luo was so shocked that his legs went weak and his face twitched as he chattered his teeth.

Now, Mo Qingyun gave him a feeling even more terrifying than the Eye Demon of the Battlefield.

How could someone who killed an Eye Demon of the Battlefield not be more terrifying than it?

As for Ling Luo's reaction, Mo Qingyun just smiled faintly and did not pay much attention.

Now, the most important thing for him was to refine this Eye Demon of the Battlefield first.

For he had seen someone before, who after refining countless Body Demons' bodies and using their bloodline power, had strengthened his physical body to the extreme.

Thinking of that person's terrifying physique, Mo Qingyun felt a bit impatient now.

He wanted to see if after refining this Eye Demon's bloodline power, his eyes would change in any way.

Having this thought, Mo Qingyun no longer hesitated and lifted his hand to grab the Eye Demon's body.

Then, he began refining the Eye Demon of the Battlefield, gradually refining its essence blood.

As he refined the Eye Demon's essence blood, Mo Qingyun clearly sensed that his bloodline power seemed to be getting stronger.

Especially his pupils, after being reinforced by the Eye Demon's bloodline power, became more piercing.

Having this discovery, Mo Qingyun refined the Eye Demon of the Battlefield even harder, like a sponge absorbing water.

Chapter 193: Refining the Eye Demon of the Battlefield

At that moment, as Mo Qingyun was fully refining the Eye Demon of the Battlefield, Ling Luo finally caught up.

"Gulp!"

When Ling Luo saw Mo Qingyun's actions, he was filled with fear and unconsciously swallowed.

Now, he really was frightened by Mo Qingyun's actions.

Refining the Eye Demon of the Battlefield seemed to be too crazy in Ling Luo’s view.

"Is this guy crazy?"

Ling Luo's face showed a look of fear, his expression twitched as he hurriedly urged Mo Qingyun: "Quick... quick, stop. Do you want to die?"

Hearing Ling Luo's anxious words, Mo Qingyun showed a look of puzzlement and asked: "Why so?"

"Didn't you hear that the dead Eye Demon of the Battlefield is even more terrifying than a living one?"

Seeing Mo Qingyun's puzzled look, Ling Luo almost went mad and explained: "Not long ago, the Ten Great Kingdoms' people joined forces to kill an Eye Demon of the Battlefield at the cost of dozens of lives. Among them, one person wanted to refine it and was taken over by the Eye Demon, becoming its puppet."

"Ah, you're talking about this!"

Hearing Ling Luo's words, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and understood his meaning: "Don't worry; I have my ways to deal with it."

The situation Ling Luo described, Mo Qingyun had seen before. Many people wanted to refine Body Demons and were taken over by them.

The strength of the Body Demons was much greater than that of this True Essence Realm First Stage Eye Demon.

So, Mo Qingyun did not take this Eye Demon seriously at all now.

After responding to Ling Luo, he no longer hesitated and continued refining the Eye Demon of the Battlefield.

Seeing Mo Qingyun's actions, Ling Luo immediately went mad and realized that Mo Qingyun did not listen to him at all.

Of course, while going mad, Ling Luo was also a bit worried and looked at Mo Qingyun hesitantly.

"Should I stop this guy? If he continues refining the Eye Demon of the Battlefield, there's a high chance it will take over his body."

"What if he is taken over by the Eye Demon of the Battlefield and doesn't recognize me, attacking me?"

"Should I slip away while he's refining the Eye Demon of the Battlefield?"

"What if he isn't taken over and sees me gone, thinking I'm a failure?"

"Ah, what should I do? What should I do?"

...

At that moment, Ling Luo's emotions were very complex: fear, worry, hesitation...

"Alright, I have principles. Since we met, I'll watch over him."

After some hesitation, Ling Luo decided to stay and guard Mo Qingyun.

Thus, time passed slowly.

Under Mo Qingyun's continuous refinement, the Eye Demon of the Battlefield’s body began to wither.

In an instant, a day passed.

At that moment, as Mo Qingyun was about to completely refine the Eye Demon of the Battlefield, a shocking wave of soul power burst from its body.

Then, Mo Qingyun sensed that his soul was hit by a strong force, as if it were about to be shattered.

Seeing this happen, Mo Qingyun was not surprised; he knew that the Eye Demon of the Battlefield intended to shatter his soul and take over his body.

"Want to take over my body? You're not qualified enough."

Having this discovery, Mo Qingyun smirked with a hint of disdain.

His current soul cultivation had reached the Spirit Essence Realm, where his soul was solidified; it wasn't easily shattered.

Then, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and retaliated against the Eye Demon of the Battlefield.

Seal Door, seal it for me!

With his Soul Technique, a miniature light door appeared in Mo Qingyun's mind and pressed down on the Eye Demon’s soul.

Under the seal of the Seal Door, the strength of the Eye Demon's soul was immediately suppressed.

"Huh, the Seal Door can actually seal soul power."

This discovery made Mo Qingyun's expression change and he felt a hint of joy, an unexpected gain.

Soul Heaven Seal

While feeling joyful, Mo Qingyun did not idle and immediately summoned the Soul Battle Seal to press down on the Eye Demon's soul.

Puff!

Under the pressure of the Soul Battle Seal, the Eye Demon’s soul turned into nothingness and floated in Mo Qingyun's mind.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and refined the floating Eye Demon’s soul in his mind.

With the Eye Demon's soul refined, Mo Qingyun finally completely refined the Eye Demon of the Battlefield.

And his soul power also slightly increased at that moment.

"Who would have thought refining an Eye Demon's soul could increase my soul power; this is a nice discovery."

Mo Qingyun showed an expression of pleasant surprise, stopped his cultivation and stood up excitedly.

At that moment, when Mo Qingyun opened his eyes, a sharp light flashed in them, revealing an imposing aura.

"Eye Demon's Pupil!"

Seeing the glow in Mo Qingyun’s eyes, Ling Luo beside him shivered and exclaimed: "Indeed taken over; this is bad. A puppet Eye Demon that took over a martial artist's body is even more terrifying."

"Better to strike first!"

After a brief panic, Ling Luo did not hesitate and gritted his teeth to overcome his fear, attacking Mo Qingyun: "I'll finish you off for my brother."

Spirit Sword Soul Technique!

As Ling Luo spoke, he summoned his soul technique directly and his aura immediately became imposing.

At the same time, a several-meter-long sword shadow appeared above Ling Luo’s body.

Ling Luo's soul technique was a Level Twelve Ordinary Soul Technique, the Spirit Sword Soul Technique.

This level of soul technique was extremely rare even in the entire Great Yan Dynasty.

Sword Breaks Nine Heavens!

Summoning his soul technique, Ling Luo did not hesitate and immediately used it.

Then, a shocking amount of soul power emerged from the Spirit Sword Soul Technique, forming a huge sword and fiercely slashing at Mo Qingyun.

This soul power-formed sword shadow moved extremely fast, flashing past in an instant and reaching Mo Qingyun's front.

"Hmm?"

Seeing Ling Luo’s actions, Mo Qingyun frowned and looked at him puzzledly: "Ling Luo, what do you mean by this?"

Flame Dragon Seal

Of course, while asking his question, Mo Qingyun did not idle and immediately summoned the Flame Dragon Battle Seal to block Ling Luo's powerful strike.

Bang bang bang...

The soul power sword shadow struck the Flame Dragon Battle Seal, emitting a metallic sound and flames bursting out, creating an astonishing aura.

Under this aura, the sky turned red instantly.

"You... You're fine? The Eye Demon of the Battlefield didn't take over you?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, Ling Luo stopped his actions and looked at him in shock.

He could not believe that Mo Qingyun was fine after refining the Eye Demon of the Battlefield.

"Why should I have any problems? Why would the Eye Demon take over me?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's response, Ling Luo was still puzzled and found it hard to believe.

Mo Qingyun really refined the Eye Demon of the Battlefield.

Seeing Ling Luo's expression, Mo Qingyun felt annoyed and kicked him: "Go to hell, from your tone it seems you hope I have problems."

"No... No, I'm just too surprised. How could I wish for you to have problems?"

Being kicked by Mo Qingyun, Ling Luo smiled awkwardly and quickly defended himself: "Since you've refined the Eye Demon of the Battlefield, let's continue our journey."

"Wait a moment!"

Hearing Ling Luo’s words, Mo Qingyun raised his hand to示意 him to pause.

Just now, after stopping his cultivation, he was attacked by Ling Luo and had not yet sensed the changes in his body after refining the Eye Demon of the Battlefield.

Seeing Ling Luo return beside him, Mo Qingyun began to sense his body and see if there were any changes.

Chapter 194: You, the Youngster, It's You!

"Refining the Eye Demon of the Battlefield, besides my vision getting stronger, there seems to be a strange power in my pupils."

After some verification, Mo Qingyun was slightly shocked and showed an expression of surprise: "This strange power is similar to the light emitted by the Eye Demon, but much weaker."

"If I continue hunting and refining more Eye Demons of the Battlefield, will my eye power get stronger?"

At that moment, a bold idea sprang up in Mo Qingyun’s heart, making him more eager to hunt and refine Eye Demons of the Battlefield.

After understanding the changes in his eyes, Mo Qingyun checked other parts of his body.

To Mo Qingyun's slight disappointment, there were no changes in the rest of his body.

At that moment, as Mo Qingyun felt somewhat disappointed with this result,

He suddenly noticed the pressure on his Dantian’s Palace seemed to have weakened a bit.

"Huh! The pressure on the Dantian Palace has actually lessened."

Feeling this change in his Dantian Palace, Mo Qingyun’s expression changed slightly and he felt a hint of joy.

Using the power of his Dantian Palace was one of his powerful trump cards; if he could use it, it would be a great thing.

After this brief joy, Mo Qingyun frowned slightly and began to ponder: "Could it be that refining the Eye Demon of the Battlefield’s bloodline power can alleviate the pressure on my Dantian Palace?"

Having this thought, Mo Qingyun became even more eager to hunt and refine Eye Demons of the Battlefield, wanting to verify it immediately.

Thus, Mo Qingyun had a clearer understanding of his current state.

After doing all this, Mo Qingyun showed an apologetic smile and said to Ling Luo: "Sorry for keeping you waiting, let's go."

"No... No problem!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Ling Luo was pleasantly surprised and quickly responded: "Brother, you're so impressive; you refined the Eye Demon of the Battlefield. Are you really fine now?"

"How could I not be fine!"

Seeing Ling Luo’s expression, Mo Qingyun shook his head helplessly and smiled faintly: "Let's not talk about this, let’s move on."

"Hehe, alright!"

Ling Luo chuckled and nodded in agreement, leading the way.

After some conversation with Ling Luo, he returned to his previous state and started talking about beauties again.

As soon as he mentioned beauties, Ling Luo became lively and energetic instantly.

Seeing Ling Luo’s performance, Mo Qingyun felt somewhat speechless and shook his head in helplessness.

Thus, for the rest of the time, Mo Qingyun listened to Ling Luo’s heroic tales.

Fortunately, this didn’t last long; after half an hour, Mo Qingyun and Ling Luo finally arrived at the city of Red Powder.

"Stop there!"

As Mo Qingyun and Ling Luo were about to enter the city, a black-faced man at the gate coldly shouted: "If you want to enter, each of you needs to pay ten Essence Crystal."

"Ten Essence Crystals? Are you robbing us?"

Hearing the black-faced man’s words, Ling Luo was shocked and exclaimed: "When we entered Red Powder City before, there were no entrance fees."

"You call it 'before', now things are different," the black-faced man sneered, showing a look of arrogance and looking down at Ling Luo: "I tell you, Red Powder City is now under our Thunder Kingdom. If you want to enter, each of you needs to pay ten Essence Crystals."

"Thunder Kingdom?"

Hearing the black-faced man’s words, Mo Qingyun's expression changed slightly and he felt surprised.

Mo Qingyun clearly remembered that Ling Luo had said before, he led a group of beasts to ambush some people, and those people seemed to be from the Thunder Kingdom.

So it turned out that they met their enemies again.

Seeing Ling Luo not responding, the black-faced man became impatient and his face darkened as he urged: "Youngster, if you can't pay the Essence Crystals, get out of here immediately and don’t stand in our way."

"You...!"

Hearing the black-faced man’s words, Ling Luo was furious and pointed at him but couldn’t speak.

"What's going on?"

At that moment, as Ling Luo and the black-faced man argued,

A cold voice came from within Red Powder City.

Then, Mo Qingyun saw a square-faced man leading several followers walk out of the city.

"Captain Lei Lie, there are two youngsters here causing trouble and not willing to pay the entrance fee."

Seeing this square-faced man approach, the black-faced man showed a look of reverence and reported to him.

"Hmph! Such boldness, daring to defy our Thunder Kingdom’s rules!"

Hearing the black-faced man's report, Lei Lie sneered and looked at Mo Qingyun and Ling Luo: "I'll see who dares to challenge our Thunder Kingdom’s authority."

"Youngster, it's you!"

When Lei Lie saw Ling Luo beside Mo Qingyun, his expression changed and he showed a look of surprise, but more anger.

After looking at Ling Luo with some surprise, Lei Lie showed a sly smile and looked at him mockingly: "Youngster, last time you escaped. This time, I'll see where you run."

Seeing Lei Lie’s expression, Mo Qingyun immediately knew that he was one of the people Ling Luo had tricked.

"Brother, let's retreat!"

Seeing Lei Lie, Ling Luo’s expression changed and he showed a look of panic, urging Mo Qingyun.

"Want to run? Not that easy."

Hearing Ling Luo’s panicked words, Lei Lie's smug smile became even more pronounced and he ordered his followers: "Go catch that youngster, along with his so-called leader. This time, I'll deal with them both."

"Yes! Captain Lei Lie!"

Hearing Lei Lie’s command, the surrounding people nodded and surrounded Mo Qingyun and Ling Luo.

Soon, their path was blocked by them.

Seeing this, Ling Luo’s expression became even more panicked and thought he was doomed.

Thinking of this, Ling Luo showed a look of apology and smiled bitterly at Mo Qingyun: "Brother, sorry for dragging you into this."

Seeing Ling Luo’s apologetic expression, Mo Qingyun waved his hand and smiled reassuringly: "Heh heh, just some small fry. No need to worry."

At that moment, as Mo Qingyun spoke,

Lei Lie and the others looked at him.

"True Essence Realm First Stage?"

When they knew Mo Qingyun’s cultivation, all of them showed a look of surprise.

True Essence Realm First Stage? This was just entering the Hundred Kingdoms Battlefield!

Having this discovery, Lei Lie was stunned for a moment and then showed a mocking smile: "A True Essence Realm First Stage youngster, just entering the Hundred Kingdoms Battlefield, also dares to talk big here. Talking without fear of tripping over your tongue."

"Captain Lei Lie, I've never seen a leader weaker than his follower before."

"He's called the Wasteful Leader with the Wasteful Follower, a Waste Combo."

"I'm sure that True Essence Realm First Stage youngster is scared stiff now."

"Not just scared, probably wetting his pants in fear, with a stench coming from his crotch."

"Hey, I feel like I've seen this youngster before. It seems familiar."

"Yeah, me too. Seen him somewhere?"

"In... In the Yellow List, this youngster is the one who got the treasure!"

...

After Lei Lie spoke,

His followers began to whisper among themselves.

Hearing their words, Lei Lie’s expression changed and he looked at Mo Qingyun closely.

After a moment of observation,

Lei Lie showed an expression of joy and exclaimed: "Youngster, it's you!"

"The treasure?"

Hearing Lei Lie’s words,

Mo Qingyun frowned and felt puzzled, wondering how he could have gotten the treasure.

He had only been in the Hundred Kingdoms Battlefield for a day and met Ling Luo, so how could there be rumors about him getting the treasure?

This was too strange.

Chapter 195: Too Weak, Let's All Attack (Third Update)

"Leader, did you get that ancient treasure?"

Hearing Lei Lie’s words,

Ling Luo also showed a look of surprise and asked Mo Qingyun.

Hearing Ling Luo’s words,

Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and asked: "Do you think it's possible?"

After Mo Qingyun’s question,

Ling Luo turned his eyes and pondered.

"Impossible!"

After some thought, Ling Luo shook his head and replied: "The ancient treasure was unearthed over a year ago. You just entered the Hundred Kingdoms Battlefield; it's impossible for you to get it so quickly."

After saying this,

Ling Luo’s eyes lit up and he exclaimed: "Leader, does that mean you were framed?"

"Probably so!"

Mo Qingyun nodded in agreement with Ling Luo’s guess and pondered who might be framing him.

Now, he had just entered the Hundred Kingdoms Battlefield; not only did he not make enemies, but he had only met Ling Luo.

Logically speaking,

Not only was it unlikely for someone to frame him, but few people knew who he was.

Thus,

This situation was worth pondering over.

"Probably someone from the Xia Kingdom."

Thinking this, Mo Qingyun had a direction in his mind and guessed: "Could it be the Hai Family?"

In Mo Qingyun’s view,

Killing so many people from the Hai Family at the border city, they definitely had a motive to frame him.

At that moment,

As Mo Qingyun pondered,

Lei Lie raised his head and looked at Mo Qingyun arrogantly: "Youngster, I'll give you a chance. If you hand over the ancient treasure and castrate yourself by crawling under my crotch, I might spare your life."

Hearing Lei Lie’s words,

Ling Luo’s expression tightened and he looked at Mo Qingyun anxiously.

"Crawl under his crotch?"

Hearing Lei Lie’s words,

Mo Qingyun sneered and looked at him disdainfully: "Don't say I look down on you; even if you want to crawl under my crotch, you don't have the qualifications."

Even if you wanted to crawl under his crotch, you didn’t have the qualifications!

After Mo Qingyun’s words,

The surrounding people’s expressions changed, shocked by his arrogance.

Mo Qingyun was too arrogant; crawling under someone's crotch and saying he didn't have the qualifications?

"This youngster is so arrogant, even more than Lei Lie. He dares to talk back to Lei Lie."

"He must be looking for trouble; in Red Powder City, offending the Thunder Kingdom is like seeking death."

"He's right. He’s looking for trouble; I’m sure he’ll die a terrible death next."

"And, I heard this youngster got some ancient treasure."

...

Hearing Mo Qingyun and Ling Luo’s conversation,

The surrounding people began to whisper among themselves.

At that moment,

A youth carrying a wine flask slowly walked into the crowd.

The youth looked at Lei Lie and his followers with a faint smile, mocking them: "Hey! The Thunder Kingdom is so powerful; bullying people again."

Hearing the youth’s words,

Lei Lie’s expression twitched and his face darkened as he said coldly: "Long Yitian, this has nothing to do with you. Don't meddle."

"If I want to?"

Long Yitian smiled faintly and replied.

Hearing Long Yitian’s words,

Lei Lie’s face darkened further as he said coldly: "Long Yitian, what do you mean? Do you want to make trouble for our Thunder Kingdom?"

"Nothing special; just can't stand it."

Long Yitian shrugged and replied calmly, then took a sip from his wine flask.

"Long Yitian, you have many connections; but don't meddle in our Thunder Kingdom’s affairs."

Just as Long Yitian spoke,

A domineering voice came from within Red Powder City.

Then, people saw a silver-haired youth slowly walk out of the city.

"That’s Lei Hong, the true ruler of Red Powder City. He was actually stirred by this."

"Lei Hong’s cultivation is said to have reached True Essence Realm Fifth Stage Peak, and he has a Super Soul Technique."

"Not only that,

Lei Hong once killed a True Essence Realm Seventh Stage Battlefield Beast with his own hands."

"So powerful; this youngster is doomed then."
