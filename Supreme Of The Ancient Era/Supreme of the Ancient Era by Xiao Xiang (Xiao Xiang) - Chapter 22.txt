“Boy, did you enjoy the taste of the Torrential Rain Sealing Needle? Now do you feel your blood circulation is blocked and your cultivation has plummeted?”

This person sneered, walking step by step towards Mo Qingyun. His gaze on Mo Qingyun was like that of a fierce beast eyeing its prey.

“Indeed, if not for the Torrential Rain Sealing Needle, my cultivation wouldn’t have broken through so quickly.”

Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and released the aura of a Second Level True Qi Realm cultivator without reservation.

“True Qi Realm, Second Level!”

Feeling the change in Mo Qingyun’s aura, this person’s expression immediately changed. He exclaimed in shock: “You… you broke through your cultivation?”

He never expected Mo Qingyun to break through his cultivation at this moment.

Originally, he thought that after being hit by the Torrential Rain Sealing Needle, Mo Qingyun’s acupoints would be sealed and his strength greatly reduced.

But now, not only did the Torrential Rain Sealing Needle fail to work, Mo Qingyun’s cultivation actually broke through.

This huge difference was hard for him to accept. The disparity between before and now was too great.

He clearly remembered that when Mo Qingyun had only First Level True Qi Realm cultivation, killing a Second Level True Qi Realm cultivator was as simple as cutting vegetables.

Now that Mo Qingyun’s cultivation had broken through to Second Level True Qi Realm, how much stronger his combat strength would be was certainly greater than before.

But just how much stronger, he had no idea at all.

Easily slaying a Third Level True Qi Realm? Fighting against a Fourth Level True Qi Realm?

Thinking of this, his expression became solemn. A hint of wariness appeared in his gaze when he looked at Mo Qingyun.

“Boy, I admit your performance surprised me.”

This person said solemnly: “But even if you broke through, you are still not my match. The difference in cultivation levels is impossible to easily overcome.”

Spit Smoke Ice Maggot, appear!

Although he said that Mo Qingyun was not his match, at this moment, he still summoned his martial soul directly.

Clearly, in his heart, it was not as easy as he said with his mouth.

Spit Smoke Ice Maggot martial soul, Eighth Level martial soul!

Seeing this person’s martial soul, Mo Qingyun frowned slightly. He was somewhat surprised by his martial soul.

The Spit Smoke Ice Maggot’s martial soul, although not of high rank, had a very powerful martial soul technique. The ice maggots it spat out could poison others’ true essence and freeze the blood within their bodies.

“Ice Maggot Poison!”

With a move, this person unleashed his martial soul technique as if he intended to kill Mo Qingyun in one strike.

Under his attack, a black mist spread from his palm and quickly enveloped Mo Qingyun. Some leaves that came into contact with this black mist instantly withered, covered in a layer of frost.

From this, it was evident that the Spit Smoke Ice Maggot’s martial soul technique was indeed extraordinary and had to be carefully dealt with.

Fire Dragon Seal

Seeing the opponent unleash his martial soul technique, Mo Qingyun immediately retaliated and summoned twenty-seven Fire Dragon Battle Seals.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun no longer held back. Facing the Ice Maggot Poison, he did not dare to be too presumptuous.

The twenty-seven Fire Dragon Battle Seals formed an instant flame shield, radiating a terrifying heat wave.

Under the power of the Fire Dragon Battle Seals’ flames, the Ice Maggot Poison quickly dissipated and was burned away.

“How… how could this happen!”

Seeing the scene before him, his face changed dramatically. He couldn’t accept such a result.

The powerful means he had relied on could still have some effect even against Sixth Level True Qi Realm cultivators.

Now, when facing Mo Qingyun, a Second Level True Qi Realm cultivator, it had lost its effect.

This sudden change was hard for him to accept.

“You’re done for, it’s my turn now.”

Ignoring the other person’s shock, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and attacked him.

Ninefold Collapse

Mo Qingyun punched out with a fist, the wild true qi on his fist instantly transforming into nine true qi fists and rushing towards him.

At this moment, the aura emanating from these nine true qi fists was several times stronger than before.

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s attack, this person’s expression changed instantly. This strike made him feel a strong sense of danger.

Azure Lotus Ice Palm

Immediately, this person did not hesitate and raised his hand to retaliate. He punched out towards the nine true qi fists.

After he punched, a cold true qi surged from his palm and condensed into an azure lotus, meeting the nine true qi fists.

Bang bang bang…

When the fist shadows and the lotus collided, they emitted a series of muffled sounds. Wild true qi fluctuations spread out.

Under these wild true qi fluctuations, Mo Qingyun and the other person’s bodies were both shaken back. However, compared to each other, Mo Qingyun retreated a step more.

From this collision, it seemed that the other person had gained some upper hand.

“Boy, although I have to admit your skills are many, the difference in realm cannot be made up for.”

Seeing that he had gained an upper hand this time, this person smiled smugly and said: “Boy, why didn’t you continue using that soul attack technique just now? If I’m not wrong, there should be some limitations to it.”

“Why didn’t you use it? There are some limitations?”

Hearing this, Mo Qingyun’s expression changed slightly. He then smiled with amusement.

It seemed that the other person mistook his actions as him running out of tricks. This result made Mo Qingyun somewhat amused, feeling a bit sorry for the other person.

When he unleashed all his power later on, how would this person feel? His emotions should be quite complex.

Chapter 81: Slaying a Fourth Level True Qi Realm

Sss…

At this moment, the sound of leaves rubbing against each other came from not far away.

Then Mo Qingyun saw a figure approaching rapidly, it was Jiang Guardian.

Seeing Jiang Guardian arrive, this person immediately smiled smugly and said coldly: “Boy, Jiang Guardian has arrived. This time you’re done for.”

“Done for?”

Mo Qingyun smiled indifferently and replied: “Indeed, but not me. It’s you.”

During the battle just now, he had already known his own strength.

Without using any trump cards, his current strength should be enough to deal with a Third Level True Qi Realm cultivator, comparable to a Fourth Level.

Knowing his own depth, Mo Qingyun no longer played around with the other person and immediately unleashed all his power.

Soul Heaven Seal

Following this, a soul battle seal was summoned and rapidly rushed towards him, instantly striking his crown.

“Ah!”

Struck by the soul battle seal, he cried out in pain and fear: “You… you can actually use such a technique.”

“Did I say you couldn’t?”

Mo Qingyun smiled with amusement and continued his attack.

Blood Qi Rampage!

Once the martial soul technique was unleashed, Mo Qingyun’s aura instantly surged, reaching Fifth Level True Qi Realm in an instant.

“True Qi Fifth Level!”

Feeling Mo Qingyun’s aura, this person’s expression twitched. He said in fear: “You… your cultivation is True Qi Fifth Level.”

Just now, Mo Qingyun could fight him head-on with only Second Level True Qi Realm cultivation.

Now that Mo Qingyun had shown Fifth Level True Qi Realm cultivation, to crush him was as easy as playing.

Thinking this way, his face turned pale. Was he really going to die at Mo Qingyun’s hands?

Ninefold Collapse

Ignoring the other person’s panic, he raised his hand and punched him.

With a punch, the surging true qi instantly formed nine fist shadows, like tigers pouncing towards him.

Azure Lotus Ice Palm

Facing Mo Qingyun’s attack, this person also quickly punched out to defend against it.

Sss…

His palm imprint was almost like paper in Mo Qingyun’s fist shadows, instantly shattered.

Dispersing the azure lotus palm imprint, the nine fist shadows sped forward and struck him instantly.

Puh!

Struck by the fist shadows, his body flew out, spitting blood and falling to the ground.

At this moment, his face was filled with unwillingness. He roared: “No… I don’t want to die, you can’t kill me.”

He couldn’t accept that while Jiang Guardian had arrived, he was going to be killed by Mo Qingyun.

For him, it was like stepping from heaven to hell in an instant. Jiang Guardian’s arrival had given him hope, but the result was that he would still be killed by Mo Qingyun. This made him feel despair.

This outcome was indeed cruel for him.

Bang!

As he roared, Mo Qingyun kicked his chest and stepped on him into the ground, killing him thoroughly.

Thus, a Fourth Level True Qi Realm cultivator was killed!

“Boy, you killed Cheng Changyun…”

Seeing the Fourth Level True Qi Realm cultivator Cheng Changyun being killed by Mo Qingyun in an instant, Jiang Guardian’s face showed shock. He couldn’t believe what he saw.

He knew Cheng Changyun’s cultivation was genuine Fourth Level True Qi Realm, yet Mo Qingyun had killed him.

“True Qi Fifth Level!”

After a brief shock, Jiang Guardian felt Mo Qingyun’s aura change and was shocked again.

This was actually Mo Qingyun’s true cultivation. Previously, Mo Qingyun had been hiding his cultivation.

This boy’s scheming was terrifying; they were thoroughly outwitted by Mo Qingyun.

But what frightened Jiang Guardian the most was Mo Qingyun’s age.

Mo Qingyun was only around sixteen or seventeen years old, yet he had Fifth Level True Qi Realm cultivation.

Mo Qingyun’s talent in cultivation was indeed terrifying.

If he offended such a person, it would be very dangerous.

“Boy, I’ve never seen someone with such extraordinary talent as you.”

Jiang Guardian sighed and said coldly: “But because of this, today you must die.”

He was worried that if Mo Qingyun was killed today and grew up in the future, it would be his nightmare.

So he had to kill Mo Qingyun at all costs.

“Worried if you have the ability?”

Mo Qingyun’s expression also became solemn. Jiang Guardian’s Seventh Level True Qi Realm cultivation gave him considerable pressure.

This was a high-level True Qi Realm cultivator, whose strength far surpassed ordinary True Qi Realm cultivators.

“Big talk. High-level True Qi Realm is not as simple as you think.”

Jiang Guardian sneered and said: “If not for your constant evasion, you would already be a corpse. But this time I won’t give you the chance to escape.”

Roaring Lion, appear!

With that said, Jiang Guardian summoned his martial soul. Instantly, a surging heat wave spread in the air.

Above Jiang Guardian appeared a five-meter-long red lion shadow.

“Tenth Level martial soul, Roaring Lion martial soul?”

Seeing Jiang Guardian’s martial soul, Mo Qingyun was slightly surprised. He didn’t expect Jiang Guardian to possess a Tenth Level martial soul.

This was the second Tenth Level martial soul he had seen since his rebirth.

“Scared?”

Jiang Guardian said smugly. Seeing Mo Qingyun’s expression, he thought that Mo Qingyun was frightened by his Roaring Lion martial soul.

“Scared? You think too highly of yourself.”

Mo Qingyun shook his head indifferently.

Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon, appear!

Disdainfully responding to Jiang Guardian, Mo Qingyun no longer hid and summoned his Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul.

The moment the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul appeared, the dim forest was instantly illuminated by a crimson light.

The twenty-meter-long Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul looked like an emperor, surveying the Roaring Lion martial soul below.

Facing the Heavenly Dragon’s aura, the Roaring Lion martial soul trembled slightly at this moment.

“Heavenly Dragon martial soul, super martial soul!”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s martial soul, Jiang Guardian’s expression changed. He exclaimed in shock: “You… you actually possess a super martial soul.”

“Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon, swallow it for me!”

Ignoring Jiang Guardian’s shock, Mo Qingyun controlled the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul to swallow the Roaring Lion martial soul.

Roar!

The Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul roared and twisted its huge body, swallowing the Roaring Lion martial soul in one bite.

Puh!

The martial souls were connected to their cultivators’ minds. When the Roaring Lion martial soul was swallowed, Jiang Guardian’s mind suffered a blow and he spat blood, his face turning pale.

“You… your martial soul actually swallowed my Roaring Lion martial soul.”

Discovering that he lost the connection with his Roaring Lion martial soul, Jiang Guardian’s expression turned fearful.

Looking at Mo Qingyun now, his gaze had changed slightly.

The means Mo Qingyun displayed were too strange, completely beyond his understanding.

“Run!”

Thinking this, Jiang Guardian no longer dared to linger and turned to flee.

At this moment, he was afraid. The means Mo Qingyun displayed made him feel fear from the bottom of his heart.

“Now you know to run. Do you think you can escape?”

Seeing Jiang Guardian’s actions, Mo Qingyun smiled coldly with amusement.

Chapter 82: Fighting a High-Level True Qi Realm (Second Update)

Shadow Step

After speaking, Mo Qingyun’s figure moved and he chased after Jiang Guardian rapidly.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun pushed the Shadow Step to its limit. His movements were like a shadow following.

After several dodges, he caught up with Jiang Guardian and blocked his path in front of him.

Seeing his way blocked, Jiang Guardian’s face darkened. He said with a wary expression: “Boy, don’t overstep your bounds!”

Although Mo Qingyun’s surface cultivation was not as high as his, the feeling he gave him was too strange.

Not only did he possess a secret technique to attack others’ souls, but also powerful martial techniques and astonishing agility.

Moreover, Mo Qingyun’s martial soul was equally formidable. It could even swallow his martial soul.

If he had a choice, he wouldn’t want to fight someone like Mo Qingyun.

Facing such a person, Jiang Guardian felt fear from the bottom of his heart. It was like facing an unknown creature.

He couldn’t know what strange techniques Mo Qingyun would use next.

“Overstepping your bounds?”

Mo Qingyun glanced at Jiang Guardian disdainfully and said coldly: “When you intercepted us earlier, did you think about this?”

“Humph!”

Jiang Guardian snorted and said: “Boy, your skills are many. I have to admit this. But if I want to leave, with your current cultivation, you can’t stop me.”

“Is that so?”

Mo Qingyun narrowed his eyes and smiled faintly: “You overestimate your abilities. My current cultivation is enough to kill you.”

Light Gate Martial Soul, appear!

With that said, Mo Qingyun no longer wasted words with Jiang Guardian and summoned the Sealing Gate martial soul.

Instantly, a light gate filled with ancient aura appeared above Mo Qingyun’s head.

“Another martial soul!”

Seeing the white light gate martial soul appear, Jiang Guardian’s expression twitched. The fear on his face intensified.

What kind of prodigy had he encountered?

Dual martial souls, perhaps not even one would appear in the entire Xia Kingdom within a hundred years.

Such an existence had been encountered by him. He didn’t know if it was his good luck or bad luck.

“Sealing Gate, seal him!”

At this moment when Jiang Guardian was shocked and dazed, Mo Qingyun pointed at him. Instantly, a miniature light gate formed.

The moment the miniature light gate formed, it rushed towards Jiang Guardian at lightning speed.

Facing the Sealing Gate martial soul technique’s attack, Jiang Guardian didn’t react in time and was struck directly.

Puh!

Following this, Jiang Guardian spat out a mouthful of blood. His mind shook and he looked at Mo Qingyun in disbelief.

“Martial soul technique!”

Seeing the miniature light gate was actually Mo Qingyun’s martial soul, Jiang Guardian’s expression twitched again.

Mo Qingyun not only possessed two martial souls but also awakened two martial soul techniques. Was he human?

More importantly, Mo Qingyun’s Sealing Gate martial soul technique was too strange. It could seal his flesh and blood power.

It was like a stronger version of the Torrential Rain Sealing Needle.

Could this martial soul technique’s power be even more bizarre?

At this moment, Jiang Guardian was almost driven mad.

Under the Sealing Gate martial soul’s sealing power, his cultivation quickly dropped to Sixth Level True Qi Realm.

Combined with the earlier damage from his martial soul being swallowed, he could only exert strength comparable to Fifth Level True Qi Realm now.

Discovering this, Jiang Guardian’s face turned ashen.

Now he could only exert strength comparable to Mo Qingyun. With Mo Qingyun’s various means, how could he be his match?

At this moment, Jiang Guardian cursed Schen Ming’s ancestors in his heart.

What kind of monster had Schen Ming provoked!

If not for Schen Ming, he wouldn’t have encountered such a freak like Mo Qingyun.

“Brother, let’s talk. When I attacked you earlier, it was不得已.”

Thinking of Mo Qingyun’s strangeness, Jiang Guardian pleaded: “If you can spare me, I’ll do anything for you.”

“Spare me?”

Mo Qingyun smiled disdainfully and said: “Give me a reason not to kill you. Remember, you only have one chance.”

“What if I owe you a favor?”

Jiang Guardian asked.

“Owe me a favor?”

Mo Qingyun glanced at Jiang Guardian disdainfully and said: “Do you think your favors are valuable? Since your reason can’t move me, go die.”

Soul Heaven Seal

With that said, Mo Qingyun didn’t wait for Jiang Guardian to speak and acted.

This time, he made no reservations. Nine soul battle seals were summoned.

Nine!

Seeing the nine soul battle seals, Jiang Guardian’s face turned pale. His body even trembled slightly.

He already had a nightmare-like fear of the soul battle seals.

A single one striking his soul was hard to bear, let alone nine attacking him simultaneously now.

But Mo Qingyun didn’t pay any attention to his fear.

Following this, the nine soul battle seals struck him in succession under his terror and severely injured his soul.

Puh!

Under the nine battle seals’ strikes, Jiang Guardian spat out a mouthful of blood. Blood trickled from his eyes and nose.

At this moment, he couldn’t be described as just suffering.

“Boy, to kill me, you also have to pay a price.”

Seeing he had no way out, Jiang Guardian decided to fight Mo Qingyun desperately.

Burning Mountain-Splitting Saber

Jiang Guardian’s palms rapidly moved, and a terrifying flame true qi gathered in his hands.

In no time, this flame true qi transformed into a saber and rapidly slashed towards Mo Qingyun.

Puh!

After unleashing this martial technique, Jiang Guardian spat out several mouthfuls of blood.

It seemed he hadn’t fully mastered this martial technique. This was the result of being counterattacked after using it.

“What a powerful martial technique!”

Seeing Jiang Guardian’s attack, Mo Qingyun’s expression changed slightly. He was somewhat surprised by its power.

From the aura of this martial technique, it had at least reached the middle stage of Earth Rank.

Although he was somewhat surprised by Jiang Guardian’s martial technique power, Mo Qingyun didn’t panic.

This level of attack was still far from killing him.

Fire Dragon Seal

Mo Qingyun also punched out with both palms, summoning twenty-seven true qi battle seals to form a huge flame shield.

The moment the flame shield formed, it met the flame saber and collided with it.

Bang! A loud sound echoed as a terrifying flame force spread outwards.

Under this flame force, some plants around were instantly burned to ashes.

Mo Qingyun and Jiang Guardian both retreated under the heat wave’s impact.

Seeing no sign of Mo Qingyun after the flame force dissipated, Jiang Guardian revealed a smug smile and said: “Boy, did you enjoy the taste of my Burning Mountain-Splitting Saber? Even with your many skills, you still died under my martial technique.”

“You’re too happy. This level of attack can’t kill me.”

As Jiang Guardian spoke proudly, Mo Qingyun’s voice came from not far away.

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s voice, Jiang Guardian’s expression turned panicked. “You… you’re not dead!”

“Since you’re not dead, how could I be?”

Mo Qingyun shook his head indifferently.

Chapter 83: Spoiled Young Master (Third Update)

Ninefold Collapse

After speaking, Mo Qingyun punched Jiang Guardian directly. His action was decisive and swift.

With a punch, wild true qi instantly gathered and transformed into nine true qi fists rushing towards Jiang Guardian.

At this moment, Jiang Guardian was already at the end of his strength.

Facing Mo Qingyun’s attack, he could barely make any basic resistance and was struck by the fist shadows.

Bang bang bang…

Following this, Jiang Guardian’s body flew out like a kite with its string cut and landed heavily on the ground.

Puh!

After landing, Jiang Guardian spat out several mouthfuls of blood. His face turned paler and he could barely move.

Seeing Jiang Guardian lying on the ground, Mo Qingyun didn’t wait for him to speak and struck him again.

After killing Jiang Guardian, Mo Qingyun took their storage bags. He wouldn’t let these war spoils go.

These people were True Qi Realm cultivators, and their storage bags had some value.

After doing this, Mo Qingyun headed back to Beimozhen Town.

On the way back, he sealed part of his cultivation and only showed peak Tenth Level Body Refinement Realm strength.

After all, if Mo Family saw his Second Level True Qi Realm cultivation now, they would be stunned.

The next morning, Mo Qingyun returned to Beimozhen Town.

Seeing it was early, he entered a teahouse and planned to eat something before going back.

Piao Xiangju, the teahouse Mo Qingyun entered was selling various pastries and snacks.

Piao Xiangju’s business was good. The downstairs seats were mostly occupied.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun went upstairs and found an empty seat. He ordered some food.

Piao Xiangju’s efficiency was high, and soon the food Mo Qingyun ordered arrived.

At this moment, as he prepared to eat his breakfast, a barking sound came from the teahouse entrance.

Hearing this bark, Mo Qingyun frowned slightly and looked out through the gap in the second-floor railing.

He saw a young man in his early twenties, leading a wolf dog, walking in with an arrogant expression.

Mo Qingyun had some impression of this young man. He was a cousin of He Lingyu, named He Chao.

Behind He Chao were several middle-aged bodyguards with fierce expressions, pushing aside those in front of them.

Soon, He Chao arrived at the second floor with his bodyguards clearing a path for him.

“The second floor is reserved by me today. Make them leave immediately.”

He Chao said arrogantly, scanning the people upstairs and pointing at them.

“Can’t you hear? Didn’t you hear Young Master He Chao’s words? Leave quickly!”

Following He Chao, one of his bodyguards shouted fiercely at the people upstairs.

Hearing this, these people didn’t dare to stay and left in panic.

With their departure, Mo Qingyun sitting there calmly eating his breakfast stood out prominently.

“Hmm?”

Seeing Mo Qingyun still seated, He Chao’s face darkened. He instructed someone behind him: “Break that boy’s legs and throw him downstairs.”

“Yes, Young Master He Chao!”

Hearing He Chao’s instructions, this person approached Mo Qingyun and said coldly: “Boy, can’t you hear? Didn’t Young Master He Chao just speak?”

“Who is He Chao? Is he that dog?”

Mo Qingyun pointed at the dog in front of He Chao and said with amusement: “But to be honest, your Young Master He Chao looks quite heroic.”

Heroic? That dog?

When Mo Qingyun said this, the surrounding expressions turned strange. Was this a compliment?

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, He Chao’s expression twisted in anger. “Chen San, come back! I’ll deal with this boy myself.”

Hearing He Chao’s shout, his bodyguards retreated.

Then He Chao approached Mo Qingyun with a grim expression. “Boy, today I broke through to Seventh Level Body Refinement Realm and couldn’t find a sparring partner. Now I’ll use you to practice my new powerful martial technique.”

After speaking, He Chao punched Mo Qingyun. His posture was somewhat impressive.

“Young Master He Chao, break that boy’s legs.”

Seeing He Chao attack, his bodyguards cheered.

But soon their cheers stopped.

They saw that the person attacking Mo Qingyun was spun around by a slap from Mo Qingyun, spinning in place.

After spinning several times, He Chao finally stopped. But now he felt dizzy.

Taking a few wobbly steps, He Chao stumbled towards his bodyguards.

By coincidence, he fell onto the wolf dog’s rear end.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly. “So this is your new martial technique—dog butt biting. Such profound martial techniques are not something ordinary people can learn.”

“Young man, you’re asking for death!”

Seeing Mo Qingyun mock him again, He Chao was furious. “You guys, attack! Break that boy’s legs and make him lick the dog butt clean.”

“Yes, Young Master He Chao!”

Hearing He Chao’s command, his bodyguards attacked Mo Qingyun without hesitation.

These bodyguards were not strong. The strongest among them was only Ninth Level Body Refinement Realm.

In Mo Qingyun’s eyes, these people were all the same as Ninth Level Body Refinement Realm cultivators.

“Get out of here!”

Seeing these people approach, Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened. He punched them.

Following this, a surging true qi surged from Mo Qingyun’s palm and struck all of them away.

In one move, more than ten Body Refinement Realm Fifth Level or higher cultivators were struck away.

Such a move could only be done by True Qi Realm experts.

So the young man sitting there was actually a True Qi Realm expert.

Seeing this, He Chao’s face changed. His legs felt weak.

At this moment, he realized what kind of existence he had provoked.

Younger than him by a few years but with True Qi Realm cultivation, this was even more terrifying talent than his family’s top genius.

With his status in the He Family, he could only consider himself unlucky for provoking such a person.

Thinking this way, He Chao smiled bitterly and said to Mo Qingyun: “Brother, just now it was a joke. It’s all a misunderstanding. Don’t take it seriously.”

“Oh? Is that so?”

Mo Qingyun smiled with amusement and looked at He Chao. “Didn’t you say to break his legs and make him lick the dog butt clean?”

“No… no, you misunderstood. I meant that my dog butt biting technique wasn’t perfect enough and I’ll show it again. This time, I’ll lick the dog butt clean.”

Following this, He Chao stepped on the wolf dog’s leg and began licking its rear end.

“Is this what you call breaking legs and making him lick the dog butt clean? You’re quite humorous.”

Seeing He Chao’s actions, Mo Qingyun smiled with amusement and no longer bothered to argue.

With his status now, arguing with a spoiled young master like He Chao would be somewhat beneath him.

After being disturbed by He Chao and his group, Mo Qingyun lost his appetite. He got up and left the teahouse.

Seeing Mo Qingyun leave, He Chao finally relaxed. He asked someone beside him: “Who is that boy? When did such a genius appear in Beimozhen Town?”

Chapter 84: Ancestral Tomb (Fourth Update)

“Young Master He Chao, that person… just now was Mo Family’s Young Master Mo Qingyun.”

At this moment, a customer in Piao Xiangju said respectfully to He Chao.

“What? That’s Mo Qingyun!”

He Chao’s expression changed. He was shocked inside.

Although he hadn’t seen Mo Qingyun, the name Mo Qingyun was very familiar to him.

From his understanding, Mo Qingyun seemed like a cultivation waste. A few months ago, he was even rejected by his cousin.

But how did Mo Qingyun become so powerful in an instant, breaking through to True Qi Realm?

“No… it’s impossible. Mo Qingyun is a waste; how could he have True Qi Realm cultivation?”

He Chao shook his head, unable to accept this reality.

In just a few months, a cultivation talent who was only Second Level Body Refinement Realm and considered a waste had become a True Qi Realm expert.

This was too strange for He Chao. No matter how he thought about it, he wouldn’t believe it.

“Young Master He Chao, recently I heard that Mo Family’s Mo Qingyun has really become a cultivation genius.”

Beside He Chao, one of his bodyguards said nervously: “It’s possible that the boy just now is Mo Qingyun.”

Hearing his bodyguard say this, He Chao’s heart started to believe it.

He was a spoiled young master and rarely cared about outside matters. His understanding of Mo Qingyun was still from a few months ago.

Perhaps in these past few months, Mo Qingyun encountered some great fortune, leading to his continuous breakthroughs.

“Sss!”

Thinking this way, He Chao drew in a breath. He was somewhat afraid: “That boy Mo Qingyun was rejected by my cousin Lingyu, he must hate our He Family. Luckily I reacted quickly just now; otherwise, I would have been in trouble.”
