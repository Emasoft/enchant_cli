In Mo Hai’s leg was crippled, Mo Cang outside the arena immediately coldly shouted.

*Snap!*

After Mo Cang spoke, Mo Qingyun once again raised his foot to step on Mo Hai’s arm, breaking it.

Seeing that he still crippled one of Mo Hai’s hands after his words, Mo Cang became furious and stood up to strike at Mo Qingyun.

Mo Cang’s movements were swift, in an instant he was already close to Mo Qingyun. When Mo Qingyun just reacted, the palm had reached him.

*The Ninefold Collapse*

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun did not dare to be careless and struck out with a full force fist towards Mo Cang’s palm.

*Bang bang bang!*

Upon contact, several muffled sounds were heard and a surge of force scattered.

Following Mo Cang’s palm strike, Mo Qingyun was forced to retreat several steps, leaving deep footprints on the ground.

*Puff!*

After stabilizing his stance, a thread of blood trickled from the corner of Mo Qingyun’s mouth.

Mo Cang was indeed a Ninth Level Body Refinement, even without using full force, this strike was not something Mo Qingyun could easily withstand.

“Did you not hear me tell you to stop?”

After injuring Mo Qingyun with a palm strike, Mo Cang looked at him coldly and said in a condescending tone.

Mo Qingyun sneered at Mo Cang’s haughty attitude and said indifferently, “Just because you tell me to stop, should I? What are you?”

What are you?

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, the younger generation was startled. Mo Qingyun actually dared to speak like this to Mo Cang.

Mo Qingyun is so arrogant!

“Humph! Indeed, he looks down on everyone. No wonder he dealt a heavy blow to his kin during the competition.”

After Mo Cang coldly shouted, he once again attacked Mo Qingyun. This time his attack was even more ruthless.

“Harming kin, according to the clan rules should be punished. Today, I will execute you on behalf of the Enforcement Hall!”

At this moment, anyone with a discerning eye could see that Mo Cang intended to cripple Mo Qingyun.

*Swift Shadow Steps*

Seeing Mo Cang attack with full force, Mo Qingyun did not dare to be presumptuous and fully activated *Swift Shadow Steps* to evade Mo Cang’s strike.

“Huh?”

Seeing his attack miss, Mo Cang’s expression changed. Greed appeared in his eyes as he thought, “What a marvelous martial technique, I must get this skill.”

After a brief hesitation, Mo Cang once again attacked Mo Qingyun with a grab and shouted, “Mo Qingyun, don’t you surrender? Accept the clan rules punishment!”

At this moment, Mo Feilin arrived at the arena and blocked Mo Cang’s strike with a palm. He said, “Mo Cang, you are being too bold.”

“Uncle Feilin, Mo Qingyun harmed kin and disrespected clan rules. Are you going to protect him? Or is this your indulgence?”

Seeing Mo Feilin block his strike, Mo Cang placed his hands behind him and looked at Mo Feilin arrogantly.

“Disrespecting clan rules, harming kin, what a big accusation.”

Hearing Mo Cang’s words, Mo Qingyun sneered and said, “Mo Cang, I ask you. During the competition, Mo Hai took a forbidden pill first and did not admit defeat. Could I continue to attack? Now, you are interfering in the competition and want to deal a heavy blow to me. Is this not disrespecting clan rules, harming kin?”

Mo Cang did not expect Mo Qingyun to be so sharp with his words. After hearing several questions from Mo Qingyun, he was speechless.

Seeing the silent Mo Cang, Mo Qingyun coldly said again, “With Mo Hai’s status, he could not obtain such a forbidden pill. Where did this forbidden pill come from? Mo Cang, don’t tell me you didn’t know?”

After saying this, Mo Qingyun’s expression turned cold and he looked at Mo Cang with a glint in his eyes. “Mo Cang, you can protect Mo Hai this time but not forever. In the next competition, I will cripple him!”

Chapter 13: Cunning Mo Cang

You can protect Mo Hai once, but not forever.

In the next competition, I will cripple him!

When these words came out of Mo Qingyun’s mouth, they were like thunder in the younger generation's minds.

Mo Qingyun actually spoke to Mo Cang this way. Is he challenging him?

In the younger generation of the Mo family, Mo Cang is like a king. There are few who dare to confront him.

Now, Mo Qingyun actually spoke this way to Mo Cang. It was beyond everyone’s expectations.

“What a good lad, he has spirit and courage. In the Mo family, not many dare to confront Mo Cang like this.”

“However, with his Fourth Level Body Refinement cultivation challenging a Ninth Level Body Refinement like Mo Cang, it seems somewhat impulsive and reckless.”

“Indeed. In this way, his situation in the future might become troublesome.”

...

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s actions, the elders on the judging platform each expressed their opinions.

In the arena,

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Mo Cang’s expression turned even colder. He said in a deep voice, “In the next competition, you say you will cripple my second brother. You are quite bold. Since so, I challenge you now. Are you willing to fight?”

Mo Cang is challenging Mo Qingyun?

Hearing these words, everyone was shocked and their eyes widened in disbelief.

“You are challenging me?”

Amidst the shock, Mo Qingyun sneered at Mo Cang and said disdainfully, “Is there something wrong with your brain? You, a Ninth Level Body Refinement, challenging me, a Fourth Level Body Refinement. I really admire your thick skin.”

When Mo Qingyun said this, everyone’s expressions changed and became playful.

Yes, with his Ninth Level Body Refinement, Mo Cang challenging a Fourth Level Body Refinement like Mo Qingyun is quite unreasonable.

Mo Cang was not surprised by Mo Qingyun’s refusal to challenge him. If Mo Qingyun accepted his challenge, that would be unusual.

He said this just to provoke Mo Qingyun a bit.

Of course, if Mo Qingyun accepted the challenge, he wouldn’t mind defeating him now.

“Humph! Do you think dodging this battle is enough?”

Mo Cang coldly said, “At the year-end clan competition, I will challenge you again. Then there won’t be any choice for you.”

The clan competition is similar to the monthly trial, a way for the Mo family to test their younger generation’s progress.

However, the clan competition is held only once a year at the end of the year.

During the clan competition, not only ordinary and elite younger generations participate but also some key members of the family. They compete to verify their progress over the year.

Additionally, during the clan competition, one cannot refuse a challenge from others.

This is why Mo Cang said he would challenge Mo Qingyun again at the clan competition.

Of course, it is rare for someone like today’s Mo Cang to challenge Mo Qingyun.

Generally, those with lower cultivation levels challenge someone slightly higher than them.

Mo Qingyun was well aware of Mo Cang’s thoughts. He said calmly, “Rest assured, at the year-end clan competition, even if you don’t challenge me, I will challenge you.”

Mo Qingyun said this because he believed that a battle was inevitable. It would be better to take the initiative.

This way, Mo Cang will have to consider his next move and allow him some peace for cultivation.

With only two months left until the end of the year, he didn’t want to be disturbed during his cultivation.

After Mo Qingyun said this, a commotion arose in the arena.

“What? Did I hear it right? Mo Qingyun will challenge Mo Cang at the year-end clan competition.”

“Is Mo Qingyun crazy? There are only two months left until the end of the year. He can’t possibly surpass Mo Cang.”

“He has no choice, at the clan competition one cannot refuse a challenge. Even if he doesn’t challenge Mo Cang, Mo Cang will still challenge him.”

“Although I know that he will lose badly at the end, I admire his courage.”

...

The younger generation whispered among themselves.

“Qingyun, you can’t do this. There are only two months left until the end of the year. You cannot be Mo Cang’s match.”

After hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Mo Feilin hurriedly tried to stop him, hoping he wouldn’t act on impulse.

Hearing Mo Feilin’s words, Mo Qingyun smiled indifferently and said, “Uncle Four, don’t worry. There are still two months until the end of the year and I have no choice but to face him.”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s words, Mo Feilin didn’t know what else to say.

Mo Qingyun was right. He had no choice but to face Mo Cang.

This battle couldn’t be avoided, so it was better to take the initiative and challenge him. At least this way, Mo Qingyun wouldn’t be at a disadvantage in terms of morale.

“Be confident when the time comes. I hope you make some progress in these two months, otherwise it will be boring if you can’t even withstand half a move of mine.”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s actions, Mo Cang’s expression changed and he said with a cold smile.

“You too. Don’t let me defeat you, otherwise it will be embarrassing for you.”

Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and said playfully.

“You don’t need to worry about it.”

Mo Cang replied indifferently and then revealed a cunning look. He said, “The two martial techniques you used just now don’t seem to be from the family’s martial arts library. As a direct descendant of the Mo family, you should contribute to the family. Shouldn’t you hand over those two martial techniques now?”

“Mo Cang, you…”

Hearing Mo Cang’s words, Mo Feilin’s expression darkened and he pointed at Mo Cang angrily.

Mo Feilin knew that with Mo Cang’s status, once Mo Qingyun handed over the martial techniques to the family, they would soon be in his possession.

These were Mo Qingyun’s trump cards. If Mo Cang also mastered them, Mo Qingyun would be at a disadvantage in the year-end clan competition.

From this perspective, Mo Cang’s intentions were not pure.

“Mo Cang is so cunning. If Mo Qingyun hands over the martial techniques, they will soon be in his possession.”

“Yes, with Mo Cang’s status, he can choose the family's powerful martial techniques first.”

...

Seeing Mo Cang’s actions, everyone around him looked at him disdainfully and felt that Mo Qingyun was being treated unfairly.

While the crowd was indignant, Mo Qingyun smiled calmly and said, “Of course, I will hand them over to the family…”

“Hey, are you stupid? If you hand over the martial techniques to the family now, Mo Cang will master them. What will you use against him in the clan competition?”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Mo Xiao’s expression changed and he whispered anxiously to him.

Mo Qingyun responded with a faint look. He then said to Mo Cang, “But not now, after the clan competition at the end of the year. I will write down the complete techniques and hand them over to the family so that all the younger generations can practice.”

“What? Mo Qingyun really intends to hand over those two martial techniques to the family. Did I hear it right?”

“And he said that all the younger generations can practice them. Does this mean we will have a chance to practice them too?”

“I am looking forward to the results of practicing those two martial techniques.”

...

After Mo Qingyun spoke, there was another commotion.

Hearing these words, Mo Cang’s expression darkened. He knew that his plan was in vain.

His intention was to make Mo Qingyun hand over the two martial techniques now, so that he would lose his trump cards in the clan competition at the end of the year.

This way, dealing with Mo Qingyun would be easier for him and he wouldn’t have to worry about other variables.

But now it seemed impossible.

“We’re leaving!”

Then, Mo Cang decided not to stay any longer. He said a few words to Mo Hai and the others before turning around and leaving.

Chapter 14: First Place?

Hearing Mo Cang’s words, Mo Hai’s followers quickly carried him and followed Mo Cang.

Seeing Mo Cang leave, Mo Qingyun and Mo Feilin also walked towards the outside of the arena.

Then came the third, fourth, and subsequent rankings in the competition.

Soon, the top ten rankings were announced.

Following the announcement of the top ten, rewards for these positions were distributed.

Mo Qingyun won first place in the monthly trial and received a reward of ten thousand gold coins.

Seeing the ten thousand gold coins, Mo Qingyun smiled brightly.

With these ten thousand gold coins, he could buy enough medicinal herbs to refine foundation-building elixirs to aid his cultivation.

He was confident that with these ten thousand gold coins, he could make significant progress in his cultivation.

“Let’s go back.”

Seeing Mo Qingyun receive the ten thousand gold coins, Mo Feilin called out to him with a smile. “You’ve become rich overnight, Fourth Uncle is envious.”

Hearing Mo Feilin’s words, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and said, “Should I treat Fourth Uncle to a drink then? To buy his silence.”

“Uh!”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Mo Feilin was surprised and then smiled. “You’re a cheeky monkey, teasing your Fourth Uncle. But since you offered to treat me, I’ll forgive you this time.”

“Haha!”

Hearing Mo Feilin’s words, Mo Qingyun smiled憨厚地.

“However, it shouldn’t just be you and me. We should also invite your eldest uncle.” Mo Feilin added.

“Let’s go to your eldest uncle’s place.”

Mo Qingyun nodded and followed Mo Feilin.

Soon, they arrived at Mo Feipeng’s residence.

“Qingyun, Feilin, you’re here!”

Seeing Mo Qingyun and Mo Feilin arrive, Mo Feipeng smiled faintly and greeted them. He pointed to the stone benches in the courtyard and said, “Come over here.”

Then Mo Qingyun and Mo Feilin sat down beside Mo Feipeng.

After they were seated, Mo Feipeng looked curiously at them and asked, “Qingyun, with your Fourth Level Body Refinement cultivation, you should have entered the top thirty in this monthly trial.”

“Top thirty?”

Hearing Mo Feipeng’s words, both Mo Qingyun and Mo Feilin were surprised.

They didn’t expect that in Mo Feipeng’s mind, Mo Qingyun could only get into the top thirty.

Seeing their expressions, Mo Feipeng’s expression changed and a hint of disappointment appeared on his face.

He thought that their expressions meant they didn’t enter the top thirty.

Then Mo Feipeng sighed and comforted Mo Qingyun, “Your cultivation has improved too quickly. You might not be able to fully display your strength in a short time, so you didn’t perform well in this monthly trial.”

“Don’t be discouraged. In the next monthly trial, I believe you will achieve a good result.”

Mo Feipeng continued.

“Don’t be discouraged, next monthly trial?”

Hearing Mo Feipeng’s words, both Mo Qingyun and Mo Feilin smiled wryly.

They didn’t expect that Mo Feipeng had no confidence in Mo Qingyun entering the top thirty.

Seeing their expressions, Mo Feipeng felt a strange thought arise in his mind. “Did I guess wrong?”

Thinking this, Mo Feipeng试探性地asked again, “Could it be that you entered the top thirty in this monthly trial?”

Saying this, Mo Feipeng looked expectantly and his face showed a hint of joy.

Then he saw Mo Qingyun nod in confirmation. Seeing this, Mo Feipeng asked excitedly, “Could it be that you entered the top twenty-five?”

Although he knew Mo Qingyun had a better ranking than thirty, Mo Feipeng didn’t dare to guess too high.

“Top twenty-five?”

Mo Qingyun and Mo Feilin were speechless again, showing a look of frustration.

Couldn’t Mo Feipeng increase the ranking by more?

Seeing their expressions, Mo Feipeng felt he might have guessed wrong again.

“Could Qingyun’s ranking be better than twenty-five?”

This thought arose in his mind, and Mo Feipeng couldn’t help but ask again, “Could it be that you entered the top twenty?”

“Top twenty?”

Mo Qingyun and Mo Feilin were speechless again, shaking their heads unconsciously.

It seemed that Mo Feipeng’s perception of Mo Qingyun was still based on his original state.

To change this perception, it would be difficult for Mo Feipeng to guess Mo Qingyun’s actual ranking.

Seeing their headshakes, Mo Feipeng became excited and asked in surprise, “Could it be that Qingyun’s ranking is within the top fifteen?”

Saying this, Mo Feipeng clenched his fists and showed a look of joy.

It was unexpected. He never thought Mo Qingyun would rank in the top fifteen.

He had some understanding of the younger generation’s strength within the family.

Even with Mo Qingyun’s Fourth Level Body Refinement cultivation, it was still difficult to enter the top fifteen.

From this perspective, Mo Qingyun did very well and gave him a pleasant surprise.

However, when Mo Feipeng was pleasantly surprised by Mo Qingyun’s ranking in the top fifteen, Mo Feilin couldn’t bear it anymore.

He didn’t want to let Mo Feipeng guess any longer. In his view, it was too much for Mo Feipeng.

Then Mo Feilin sighed and said, “Brother, do you think Qingyun is so incapable? Can he only get the top fifteen?”

At this moment, Mo Feilin spoke with righteous indignation.

He had completely forgotten that when Mo Qingyun was in the monthly trial, his performance was similar to Mo Feipeng’s now.

Hearing these words, Mo Feipeng couldn’t help but look at Mo Feilin in shock and asked, “Could Qingyun’s ranking be better than fifteen? This…”

Mo Feipeng was a bit dazed, feeling that his brain wasn’t working properly.

The surprise Mo Qingyun gave him was too sudden and stimulating.

“Mm-hmm!”

Hearing these words, Mo Feilin nodded and said, “Qingyun’s ranking in this monthly trial is first place.”

“What! First place? How could that be possible?”

Hearing Mo Feilin’s words, Mo Feipeng stood up and looked at Mo Qingyun as if he saw a monster.

If Mo Feilin hadn’t told him, he wouldn’t have dared to guess first place.

After a brief surprise, Mo Feipeng suddenly laughed and said with a knowing expression, “I know. Fourth Brother, did Qingyun perform well in this monthly trial and you made up a lie to fool me? But even if you lied, it should be more convincing. First place, how could that be possible?”

“I have some understanding of the younger generation’s strength within the family. Even if Qingyun is now quite strong, it would be impossible for him to get first place.”

Mo Feipeng shook his head and said with a faint smile, not believing that Mo Qingyun got first place.

Seeing Mo Feipeng’s actions, Mo Qingyun and Mo Feilin were helpless. They smiled bitterly at each other.

Then Mo Feilin didn’t want to explain further and threw the乾坤袋containing ten thousand gold coins into the stone table. He said, “This is Qingyun’s reward for getting first place in the monthly trial. Ten thousand gold coins, he plans to use them to treat you and me.”

乾坤袋is a storage item in the Sky Soul Continent, using the technique of storing much within little. It creates a small space inside that can hold items far larger than the bag itself.

“Reward, ten thousand gold coins!”

Seeing Mo Feilin’s actions, Mo Feipeng was stunned and looked at Mo Qingyun and Mo Feilin blankly.

After a brief moment, Mo Feipeng suddenly realized that Mo Qingyun probably really got first place.

Then his expression changed and he asked anxiously, “Could it be that Qingyun really got first place in the monthly trial?”

“Mm-hmm!”

Mo Qingyun and Mo Feilin nodded.

Seeing their nods, Mo Feipeng was overjoyed. He patted Mo Qingyun’s shoulder and laughed heartily, “Good, good, good! You didn’t disappoint Third Brother. If he were here, I think he would be very happy.”

“Let’s go drink!”

Then Mo Qingyun and the others left the courtyard, heading to a tavern in North Desert Town for drinks.

Chapter 15: Cloudy City

After several rounds of drinking, Mo Qingyun and the others left the tavern and returned to the Mo family.

After returning home, they each went back to their own residences.

However, when Mo Feilin returned to his residence, he said to Mo Qingyun, “Qingyun, I will go to Cloudy City tomorrow. Prepare yourself and I’ll take you there.”

“Okay.”

Hearing Mo Feilin’s words, Mo Qingyun nodded.

According to Mo Qingyun’s thoughts, the sooner they went to Cloudy City, the better. He could buy cultivation herbs earlier and prepare new foundation-building elixirs to aid his cultivation.

Although there were some herbs for sale in the Precious Ling Shop in North Desert Town, their variety was limited.

There were many herbs Mo Qingyun needed that weren’t available in the Precious Ling Shop, which made him feel somewhat helpless.

Now being able to go to Cloudy City with Mo Feilin was a good thing for Mo Qingyun.

Compared to North Desert Town, Cloudy City was much more prosperous.

The variety of herbs sold in the medicine shops in Cloudy City would naturally be much richer.

After returning to his residence, Mo Qingyun didn’t idle around and started cultivating immediately.

With only two months left until the year-end clan competition, he couldn’t afford to waste time.

The next morning, Mo Qingyun came to Mo Feilin’s residence and waited for him to go to Cloudy City.

“Qingyun, you’re here.”

Seeing Mo Qingyun arrive, Mo Feilin smiled and said. He packed up his belongings and said, “Let’s go.”

Then the two of them left Mo Feilin’s courtyard and went to the main gate of the Mo family.

At the main gate, there was still a convoy waiting. After Mo Feilin arrived, they started moving.

North Desert Town was quite far from Cloudy City. Normally it would take half a day to get there.

During the journey, Mo Feilin kept telling Mo Qingyun about the surrounding forces around Cloudy City.

Several hours later,

“This is Ten Mile Town, one of the hundred towns near Cloudy City and also the strongest.”

Mo Feilin pointed to a prosperous town beside the road and said, “After Ten Mile Town, it’s not far from Cloudy City.”

“Mm-hmm!”

Along the way, Mo Qingyun nodded silently as he listened to Mo Feilin’s introduction.

About an hour later, the convoy arrived at the outskirts of Cloudy City.

“Stop! What are you doing here?”

When Mo Qingyun and the others arrived at the city gate, a guard coldly asked.

“Brother Guard, we are from Qingmu Trading Company. Please let us in.”

As he spoke, Mo Feilin came to the guard and took out several gold coins from his乾坤袋and handed them over.

“Pay the entrance fee and go in.”

After receiving the gold coins from Mo Feilin, the guard smiled contentedly and nodded, waving to let them in.

Seeing this, Mo Feilin took out some more gold coins and paid the entrance fees for everyone.

Unlike North Desert Town, entering a city like Cloudy City required paying an entrance fee.

Seeing Mo Feilin’s actions, Mo Qingyun didn’t say much and just looked at him indifferently.

In his previous life as a Supreme Realm powerhouse, he had seen this many times and wasn’t surprised.

In his own city, Ancient Chariot City, people also had to pay an entrance fee to enter.

The entrance fee in Ancient Chariot City was much higher than that of Cloudy City.

After paying the entrance fee, Mo Qingyun and the others entered Cloudy City in a grand procession.

“Qingyun, things are different here in Cloudy City. Many forces here are not something the Mo family can handle.”

Entering Cloudy City, Mo Feilin said seriously to Mo Qingyun, “Be careful with your words and actions. Don’t provoke some terrifying existences and cause unnecessary trouble.”

“I know, Fourth Uncle.”

Hearing this, Mo Qingyun nodded.

He knew that Mo Feilin said this out of concern for him.

The Mo family’s strength in Cloudy City was at the bottom, and most of them were not something the Mo family could handle.

Mo Feilin didn’t want to see Mo Qingyun provoke some powerful existences, leading to them harming Mo Qingyun and the family being unable to help.

This was what Mo Feilin worried about most. He didn’t want such a thing to happen, so he reminded Mo Qingyun in advance.

Then Mo Feilin told Mo Qingyun more about Cloudy City and some things to pay attention to.

As they talked, they arrived at a shop called Qingmu Trading Company.

“This is the Mo family’s shop in Cloudy City.”

Arriving at Qingmu Trading Company, Mo Feilin smiled and introduced it to Mo Qingyun.

Hearing the introduction, Mo Qingyun saw a pile of wood in the courtyard of the shop.

This was the business the Mo family operated in Qingmu City, one of their main sources of income.

The Mo family’s wood business in Cloudy City was quite successful.

Therefore, other families in North Desert Town were envious of the Mo family’s wood business.

The front part of the courtyard was a shop, and the back part was living quarters.

After passing through the courtyard filled with wood, Mo Qingyun followed Mo Feilin to a small yard.

“You will stay here for now. If you need anything, just tell me.”

Mo Feilin pointed to a room in the yard and smiled faintly at Mo Qingyun.

“Mm-hmm, I know.”

Mo Qingyun nodded.

“I still have some things to take care of. After I finish, I’ll show you around Cloudy City.” Mo Feilin smiled again.

“Fourth Uncle, go ahead and take care of your business. I’ll just walk around by myself.”

Hearing this, Mo Qingyun smiled.

“Walk around by yourself?”

Mo Feilin was surprised and hesitated, clearly not very comfortable with Mo Qingyun going out alone.

Seeing his expression, Mo Qingyun felt warm and smiled faintly. “Fourth Uncle, don’t worry. I won’t cause trouble. I just want to walk around for a bit and will be back soon.”

Seeing this, Mo Feilin didn’t say much more. He nodded and said, “Since that’s the case, you can walk around nearby for a bit. But remember, things are different here in Cloudy City than in North Desert Town. Be more accommodating when you encounter something, or the family won’t be able to help if trouble arises. Understand?”

“Mm-hmm, I understand. I’ll be careful.”

Mo Qingyun nodded and then left the Qingmu Trading Company, wandering around Cloudy City looking for shops that sold herbs.

His main purpose was to buy some herbs and refine new foundation-building elixirs for cultivation.

Therefore, Mo Qingyun didn’t want to waste time and wanted to buy the herbs as soon as possible.

However, Cloudy City was much larger than North Desert Town. After wandering for half an hour, Mo Qingyun still hadn’t found a shop that sold herbs.

Seeing this, he decided not to wander aimlessly like a headless fly in Cloudy City any longer.

“Maybe I should go back and see if Fourth Uncle is done. With his guidance, things will be much easier.”

Thinking this, Mo Qingyun stopped wandering and headed back to the Qingmu Trading Company.

Chapter 16: Hundred Herbs Pavilion

A moment later, Mo Qingyun returned to the Qingmu Trading Company.

“Qingyun, you’re back.”

Seeing Mo Qingyun return, Mo Feilin smiled faintly and walked towards him. He said with a smile, “Are you hungry? Let’s go to a restaurant in the city and taste some of Cloudy City’s delicious food.”

“Mm-hmm!”

Hearing Mo Feilin’s words, Mo Qingyun nodded and followed him out of the Qingmu Trading Company.

Soon, they arrived at a restaurant called Delicious Inn.

Delicious Inn was quite large, covering nearly a thousand square meters. It had carved railings and jade pavilions, looking very upscale.

“This Delicious Inn is one of the famous restaurants in Cloudy City. The dishes here are very authentic. I once came here for a meal.”

After arriving at Delicious Inn, Mo Feilin introduced it to Mo Qingyun and said, “Let’s find a seat inside.”

Mo Feilin had once come here for a meal to entertain an important client.

But he wouldn’t have come himself, as the food was quite expensive.

Then Mo Qingyun and Mo Feilin entered Delicious Inn and found a quiet seat on the first floor.

After sitting down, Mo Feilin called over a waiter and ordered several signature dishes of Delicious Inn.

“Fourth Uncle, just order a few simple dishes.”

Seeing the several signature dishes Mo Feilin ordered, which totaled nearly a thousand gold coins, Mo Qingyun frowned and said.

Mo Qingyun knew that although Mo Feilin was in charge of the Mo family’s business in Cloudy City, his monthly salary was limited.

Previously, he had spent a lot of money buying jade milk for Mo Qingyun.

Now to let Mo Qingyun taste the delicious food in Cloudy City, he was spending even more money. This made Mo Qingyun feel deeply moved.

Fourth Uncle’s love for them was truly impeccable.

“Not bad, you still have a bit of conscience. But if you don’t order some signature dishes in Delicious Inn, it’s like coming here for nothing.”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Mo Feilin was slightly touched and laughed heartily.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun didn’t say much more and went along with Mo Feilin’s decision.

However, after agreeing to Mo Feilin’s choice, Mo Qingyun made a silent resolution in his heart. “I will repay Fourth Uncle’s kindness many times over.”

Mo Qingyun could see that Mo Feilin was currently stuck at the Ninth Level True Qi and couldn’t advance to the True Essence realm.

He thought that when he had the opportunity, he would refine some medicinal pills to help Mo Feilin advance.

The service at Delicious Inn was efficient, and soon several dishes were served.

“Come, try this iced cloud snow fish and roasted fire cloud beast…”

Seeing the dishes served, Mo Feilin raised his hand to signal Mo Qingyun to start eating.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun no longer hesitated and started eating. He picked up a piece of cloud snow fish meat and put it in his mouth.

The cloud snow fish was tender, melting in the mouth like ice. It had a fresh taste with a hint of coolness.

Compared to cloud snow fish, the roasted fire cloud beast was quite different in taste.

The fire cloud beast was a fire attribute monster, so its meat had a hint of flame and was chewy.

In addition, the fire cloud beast was quite powerful. A strong one could rival a peak True Essence realm powerhouse.

Therefore, the fire cloud beast’s meat was rich in blood and qi.

Every bite of fire cloud beast meat made Mo Qingyun feel a surge of flame power absorbed by his Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul.
