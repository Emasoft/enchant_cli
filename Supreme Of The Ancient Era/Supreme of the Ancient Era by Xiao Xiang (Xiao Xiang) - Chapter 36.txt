Several guards, merely at the Body Tempering Realm, were instantly sent flying into He Mansion by Mo Qingyun’s attack without even putting up a fight.

As the guards were blasted into the mansion, He Family's people immediately noticed the commotion at the entrance and rushed over.

“Daring ruffians, daring to cause trouble in He Mansion.”

With an angry shout, several figures soon appeared before Mo Qingyun.

These people were none other than He Qiansheng, the patriarch of He Family, and several elders.

Of course, standing in front of them was a cold and aloof old man, who Mo Qingyun quickly guessed to be an elder from the Xue Family.

“Mo Family brat, it’s you!”

Seeing Mo Qingyun, He Qiansheng and the others were visibly surprised.

They did not expect Mo Qingyun to dare come to He Family for revenge, and even less so that he would do it so soon.

“Patriarch, elders, master, save me!”

At that moment, as He Qiansheng and the others were in shock, He Shengchao, held by Chilin, weakly pleaded for help.

“Shengchao!”

Upon hearing He Shengchao’s voice, He Qiansheng and the others noticed him.

“Mo Family brat, you’ve gone too far!”

Seeing He Shengchao’s miserable state, He Qiansheng and the others became enraged, glaring at Mo Qingyun with bared teeth.

He Shengchao was their family’s prodigy, favored by a Xue Family elder at the Nascent Soul Realm. He was their hope for rising to prominence.

Now, Mo Qingyun had crippled him, severing their hopes of rising.

After a brief moment of fury, He Qiansheng’s face darkened as he coldly said to Mo Qingyun, “Mo Family brat, I admire your courage for coming to our He Family seeking revenge. But today, we will make you return with nothing but your life as compensation for Shengchao’s injuries.”

“With just the two of you, you don’t have that kind of ability.”

Hearing He Qiansheng’s words, Mo Qingyun smiled indifferently.

“We know that the strength you rely on is this half-step Nascent Soul Realm powerhouse beside you.”

He Qiansheng sneered and slowly said, “If it were in the past, we would have been at a loss against his attack. But now things are different; Xue Family’s elder, Xue Wang, is here in our He Family.”

He Qiansheng sneered again and added, “You may not know this, but Xue Wang is a true Nascent Soul Realm powerhouse. Today, I will make you and the red-haired old man beside you stay here.”

“What of it if he is at the Nascent Soul Realm?”

Looking at He Qiansheng’s smug face, Mo Qingyun curled his lips and said disdainfully, “I remember that Xue Family’s elder, Xue Zhuang, was also a Nascent Soul Realm powerhouse. In the end, I crippled him with one punch.”

“Young man, just because you managed to cripple Xue Zhuang, do you think it’s okay to boast?”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Xue Wang’s face darkened and he glanced at him disdainfully.

“Xue Wang elder, this young man is cunning. Don’t waste time with him.”

He Qiansheng said to Xue Wang, “Xue Wang elder, please deal with the red-haired old man. This young man we will take care of.”

“Alright!”

Xue Wang nodded after hearing He Qiansheng’s words and moved towards Chilin.

Purple Thunder Saint Hand

Xue Wang attacked with all his might, directly unleashing a martial technique and sending a palm towards Chilin.

As Xue Wang’s palm struck, a surge of energy with lightning streaks formed into a palm shadow and slammed towards Chilin.

Seeing Xue Wang’s attack, Chilin curled his lips and said disdainfully, “Compared to Xue Zhenyang, your strength is far inferior. Let me send you on your way.”

Boom!

As Chilin spoke, a powerful aura burst forth from him, causing the dust around to fly.

Nascent Soul Realm Third Stage!

The red-haired old man beside Mo Qingyun was actually a Nascent Soul Realm Third Stage powerhouse.

Everyone was momentarily stunned by this result, which exceeded their expectations.

“How is it possible? The old man beside Mo Qingyun was not at the half-step Nascent Soul Realm?”

He Qiansheng and several elders of He Family looked incredulous.

“Nascent Soul Realm Third Stage, how formidable! No wonder Mo Qingyun was not afraid of Song Wenyun and his companion.”

At this moment, those who had followed from the hotel finally understood why Mo Qingyun was not afraid of Song Wenyun and his companion.

As everyone was in awe of Chilin’s cultivation, he raised a hand and sent a palm towards Xue Wang.

Bloodthirsty Demon Palm

Then, everyone saw a huge blood-colored palm shadow descend from the sky and strike Xue Wang.

“You He Family, you dared to deceive me! After this, I will definitely destroy your He Family.”

Seeing Chilin’s powerful attack, Xue Wang was filled with anger and felt deceived by He Qiansheng and the others.

Xue Wang’s misunderstanding was understandable, as Chilin's cultivation was far beyond what He Qiansheng had described.

Bang!

Xue Wang, without any resistance, was blasted into the ground with a loud sound.

Following this, everyone saw a large crater where Xue Wang had been struck.

Xue Wang was now in tattered clothes, motionless on the ground, no longer displaying his former might.

“Master… he was not even a match for this red-haired old man’s one strike!”

Seeing Chilin casually send his master to the brink of death, He Shengchao was stunned and pale.

He could not accept that his master, whom he regarded as a deity, had been defeated by Chilin in one strike.

This result was a huge blow to He Shengchao.

Seeing Xue Wang, the Nascent Soul Realm powerhouse, defeated by Chilin, He Family’s people turned pale.

At this moment, their faces were filled with despair.

They knew that Xue Wang’s defeat meant the end for He Family.

“Kill them all!”

Mo Qingyun, without pity, ordered Chilin to kill everyone.

“Yes, Young Master!”

Chilin did not hesitate and raised his hand towards He Qiansheng and the others.

“Stop!”

Just as Chilin was about to attack, a graceful figure ran out from He Family.

This graceful figure was none other than He Lingyu, the granddaughter of He Qiansheng.

“Qingyun, I know I was wrong. Please spare He Family for our past relationship.”

After coming out, He Lingyu pleaded with Mo Qingyun, her face filled with sorrow.

“Spare He Family? Start anew?”

Hearing He Lingyu’s words, Mo Qingyun glanced at her disdainfully and said coldly, “He Lingyu, you think too highly of yourself. In my heart, you are nothing. Moreover, once things pass, they cannot be returned to their original state.”

“Out of our past relationship, I will end your life with my own hands.” Mo Qingyun looked at He Lingyu calmly and said softly.

Hearing this, He Lingyu’s face turned pale with a hint of despair in her eyes.

Then she smiled sadly, tears streaming down her face. “It’s fine to die by your hand. Go ahead.”

As He Lingyu spoke, Mo Qingyun raised his right hand and pointed at her.

Then several soul battle seals were released and struck into He Lingyu’s mind, scattering her soul.

As her soul was scattered, the light in He Lingyu’s eyes slowly faded.

Subsequently, she collapsed to the ground.

After killing He Lingyu, a strange emotion arose in Mo Qingyun’s heart, making him feel restless.

Then he said impatiently to Chilin, “Quickly finish them all.”

“Yes, Young Master!”

Chilin no longer held back and attacked He Family’s people with full force.

The highest cultivation among them was only True Essence Realm Eighth and Ninth Stage, facing Chilin at the Nascent Soul Realm Third Stage, they were like lambs being slaughtered by a tiger.

In no time, the entire He Family was filled with blood, everyone dead.

“Who would have thought that you still had a lingering attachment in your heart.”

After Chilin killed everyone, Mo Qingyun knew the source of that strange emotion and sighed inwardly. “Song Zihao and He Lingyu, I have avenged you. You should let go of your attachment.”

With Mo Qingyun’s words, that strange emotion gradually dissipated.

As the previous self's attachment faded, Mo Qingyun felt his mind suddenly clear up.

In addition, he discovered that his soul cultivation had reached a new level, reaching the peak of the Formless Realm and just one step away from Spirit Essence Realm.

This discovery made Mo Qingyun pleased, as he said solemnly, “From today on, I am a complete Mo Qingyun.”

“Everyone in He Family is dead!”

Seeing the empty He Mansion, He Shengchao was stunned and looked at the blood-stained mansion blankly.

“Since He Mansion is destroyed, you will follow them.”

With that said, Mo Qingyun raised his hand and sent a palm towards He Shengchao.

Then a five-meter-long red blade of light struck He Shengchao, killing him instantly.

“Let’s go!”

Seeing He Mansion destroyed, Mo Qingyun left without delay and headed towards Song Family.

The distance between Song Family and He Family was not far, and half an hour later, Mo Qingyun arrived at Song Family.

Upon arriving, Mo Qingyun did not waste words with the people of Song Family and directly entered their mansion.

Bang bang bang…

Under Mo Qingyun and Chilin’s powerful attacks, the guards were blasted into the mansion, their fate unknown.

“Who dares to cause trouble in our Song Mansion? Do you have a death wish?”

Seeing the guards blasted into the mansion, the people of Song Family were filled with rage.

Soon, Song Xu and others appeared before Mo Qingyun, glaring at him and Chilin.

“Mo Qingyun, it’s you!”

Seeing the troublemaker was Mo Qingyun, Song Family’s people were momentarily stunned.

But after a brief moment of surprise, they sneered and said, “Mo Qingyun, we were just looking for you. You came to us on your own.”

Song Xu sneered and added, “You probably don’t know that Xue Family’s elder, Xue You, was specially left in our Song Family to deal with you.”

In Song Xu’s view, Mo Qingyun coming now was like walking into a trap.

But when he heard Mo Qingyun’s words, he looked indifferent and said calmly, “The people of He Family also said the same thing. But in the end, Xue Wang elder was killed by us.”

“Xue Wang elder was killed by you?”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Song Xu and others burst into laughter as if they heard the funniest joke. “Young man, you must have a limit to your boasting. Do you know what level Xue Wang elder is? He’s at the Nascent Soul Realm, how could you be his match…”

As they laughed, a powerful aura pressed towards them.

Feeling this aura, their faces turned red as if they were being choked by a duck’s neck and could not utter a sound.

Nascent Soul Realm Third Stage!

The red-haired old man beside Mo Qingyun was actually a Nascent Soul Realm powerhouse.

So, what Mo Qingyun said earlier must be true; Xue Wang elder was indeed killed by them.

“You… you really killed Xue Wang elder?”

This thought made Song Xu and others look terrified, fearfully at Mo Qingyun.

“Once you’re down there, you’ll know.”

Mo Qingyun answered Song Xu’s question and then said to Chilin, “Kill them all.”

“Yes, Young Master!”

Chilin nodded and attacked Xue You and the people of Song Family.

Bang bang bang…

Facing Chilin’s overwhelming aura, everyone from Song Family was blasted away and fell heavily.

Puff!

Soon, Xue You, the elder from Xue Family, was also blasted away and fell heavily, spitting blood.

At this moment, as Chilin was about to kill Xue You, Mo Qingyun’s eyes lit up and he had a plan for dealing with the Xue Family.

“Chilin, spare Xue You’s life. I have a use for him.”

With this thought, Mo Qingyun instructed Chilin.

“Alright!”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s instructions, Chilin nodded and continued attacking the others from Song Family.

In a few minutes, everyone in Song Family met the same fate as He Family, all killed.

Mo Qingyun did not spare his enemies.

After Chilin killed everyone in Song Family, Mo Qingyun instructed him to turn Xue You into a blood slave.

“Xue You, I pay my respects to the master and Young Master Qingyun.”

After being turned into a blood slave, Xue You showed reverence and bowed to Mo Qingyun.

Seeing Xue You’s current state, Mo Qingyun’s smile widened.

Chilin quickly understood Mo Qingyun’s plan and试探地问道：“主人，你是打算架空薛家？”
“恩！”
对于赤炼猜到自己的想法，莫青云也没有隐瞒，毕竟事情的具体实施还需要赤炼出力。
“走吧，我们回连云城！”
见将宋家和何家灭掉，莫青云也难得逗留，对着赤炼交代了一句后便起身朝着宋府外走去，返回连云城。
在莫青云三人离开北漠镇后，整个北漠镇的人心中感叹不已。
想不到短短一日之间，北漠镇上最强大的两个家族被莫青云一个小辈给灭掉。
这样的事情真是让人唏嘘不已，有种兔死狐悲的心情出现。

半日后，莫青云和赤炼一起回到了碧玉府。
至于那薛佑长老，在快到连云城的时候，莫青云让他下车回到薛家养伤去了。
如今的薛佑长老是莫青云埋在薛家的一个棋子，打算通过他一步步架空薛家。
莫青云和赤炼回到碧玉府后便开始闭关修炼。
这几日的战斗中，赤炼收取了不少精血，他要将之全部炼化提升修为。
而莫青云在消除前身执念后，灵魂之力暴涨需要稳固一下。
如今莫家有薛家、天龙帮和泰山宗三方敌人，他不敢懈怠必须尽快提升修为。
莫宏天等人从莫青云手中拿到奥义之晶后也全部闭关修炼。
有了奥义之晶，他们的修为可以快速进入元丹境岂会浪费时间。
还有莫家的小辈们或许是担心被莫青云甩得太远也一个个刻苦修炼。
就算莫欣几女也苦练起来，算算时间莫青云发现已经几个月没见到她们了。
对于众人的刻苦修炼，莫青云是非常愿意看到的。
他心中很清楚早晚有一天终归是要离开莫家的。
毕竟在遥远的地方还有着很多事情等着他去解决。
如果在他离开时莫家能够强大起来有着自保之力，他走得也会放心一些。

屋中，莫青云抛开杂念沉寂到修炼之中。
首先选择稳固一下灵魂修为。
接着便对灵魂之力进行凝炼，在他的不断凝炼下，灵魂之力慢慢凝实起来。
若是别人能看到莫青云的灵魂之力一定会震惊不已的。
此刻莫青云的灵魂之力居然从气雾状态慢慢转化为液体状态化着一条条灰色的水线。
伴随着一股股灵魂之力被凝炼，莫青云身上的气势也是渐渐变得强大起来形成一种无形的威压。
五日后，一直处于修炼中的莫青云睁开了眼睛。
“灵魂修为终于稳固在虚形境巅峰了！”
修为得到稳固莫青云心中一喜脸上露出淡淡的笑容。
“如今我面对的敌人越来越强大，得修炼几门更强大的武技才行。”
莫青云眉头微皱对自己的实力提升思忖起来：“疾影步虽然修炼到奥义水准但它只是玄品武技，品阶还是太低了得替换一下，另外九重崩虽然是地品武技但在攻击方面还是弱了一些也需要替换掉。”
“如今我领悟了风、土、火三种奥义，选择武技可以从这个方面着手。”
莫青云心中思忖着：“火之奥义配对的武技有焚阳断山刀和火龙印两种目前是足够了，风之奥义方面必然选择一门身法武技至于土之奥义选择攻击类型的武技似乎威势并不强悍需要好好考虑一下。”
一番思忖之后莫青云忽然眼睛一亮心中有了方向：“对了，我想要借用丹府中的力量必须拥有强悍的才行，在对于土之奥义这块修炼一门炼体武技似乎不错。”
这么一想之后莫青云便有了决定心中选择武技起来。

一番筛选后莫青云要修炼的武技得到了确定。
猛禽破：天品初阶武技，行动如风、快如闪电奔走之下爆发出风暴之势……
金玉真身：天品中阶武技，修炼到极致强硬无比刀枪不入就连体内经脉也是如同金玉一般坚韧。
将要修炼的武技确定后莫青云便不再迟疑立刻着手修炼起来。
首先修炼的是身法武技猛禽破毕竟之前有了疾影步的基础相对而言更容易上手一些。
大鹏展翅、鹰击长空、雁过长空……
将武技猛禽破的法决回忆一遍莫青云便开始修炼起来身子轻盈在院内闪动。
轰……
伴随着莫青云一次次修炼他身上散发出来的风雷之声越来越响威势也越来越强。
十日后莫青云小院中。
这一刻莫青云后背之上形成了一个真气羽翼虚影让他如同真正的猛禽一般短暂凌空而立。
跟着莫青云便是身一动如同箭矢一般极速轰向下方的一个石凳。
砰！
莫青云一击之下石凳直接四分五裂起来被轰出扉粉。
“好强！仅仅达到入门地步便有这般威势天品武技果然不一般。”
见自己仅凭借气势没有动用奥义之力便有这样的威势莫青云立刻心中一喜。
旋即莫青云便是再次进入修炼之中一遍遍不厌其烦地修炼着。
随着莫青云不断修炼他修炼的动静越来越大起来啪啪啪啪……
此刻在莫青云的修炼下院墙上的一些瓦块在他的气势下直接被震爆啪啪直响。
这般情况出现后很快就吸引了碧玉府内的人的注意让众人朝着他的小院赶来。
不一会此刻没有修炼的莫宏天等人先后来到了莫青云小院内。
“这个小子在修炼什么武技竟然有这般恐怖的气势。”
看着莫青云的修炼架势到来的莫宏天等人都是面色震惊之色出来。
随着莫宏天等人都来莫青云则是表情一变有些意外地看向众人问道：“你们怎么都来了？”
“我们怎么来了？”
被莫青云这么无辜一问莫宏天等人都是一阵无语不知道该说些什么好。
他们之所以回来还不是因为你小子的修炼动静太大了！
这时在众人无语的时候赤炼呵呵一笑道：“少主你修炼的应该是天品武技吧？”
“恩！”莫青云点了点头倒也没有去否认。
天品武技！一旁的莫家等人闻言后立刻心中一颤起来面露震惊之色。
要知道曾经的莫家之中可是连地品武技都没有。前不久莫青云给莫宏天等人地品武技时就把他们震惊得不轻。
此刻居然莫青云说自己在修炼天品武技这个结果实在把他们惊得不轻。
而且看莫青云现在的架势似乎已经修炼成功了。连天品武技都轻松修炼成功了莫青云的修炼天赋可真是够恐怖的。
莫宏天等人很清楚武技的品阶越高修炼难度越大并不是谁都可以修炼成功的。
“你这小猴子居然连天品武技都修炼了恐怕现在我已经不是你的对手了。”
看着莫青云的成就莫飞林面露欣慰哈哈一笑敲了莫青云肩膀一下。
他说得不错虽然他在莫青云的帮助下修为已经达到了真元境但真交手起来他的实力和莫青云的差距那还是非常大的。
“之前在焚天宗遗迹中有所奇遇凑巧得到了几门天品武技。”
莫青云找了个借口掩饰了武技的来源接着又道：“等我修炼成功后我会将修炼心得以及武技原本交给爷爷让家族的其他人进行修炼。”
让莫青云意外的是莫宏天在听到他的话语却是欣慰地笑道：“你有这个心就可以了不过天品武技不用交给我们这等武技不是普通人可以修炼得了为了避免家族这些小子们好高骛远这武技还是你自己保管得好。”
“这样也好！”听到莫宏天这么说莫青云也不再多说点了点头同意了莫宏天的决定。
随后莫宏天等人又和莫青云交谈了一番便是各自离开了。不过在众人离开后赤炼却留了下来站在莫青云的身旁。

十日后黑金山中。
一个十六七岁的少年一拳将一头牛头蛇身的妖兽强势轰入地底。
“金玉真身终于小成了！”看到自己的一拳之威少年面露狂喜之色对于自己的这一拳非常满意。
这个少年自然不是别人正是在黑金山中历练的莫青云。
如今他领悟了火、土、水三种奥义而修炼的武技也是这三种属性的。
