Watching the current crowd's posture, they seemed to be planning to break through the array formation with brute force.

Under the attack of the crowd, the light curtain of the array formation kept shaking as if it might shatter at any moment.

Glancing at the crowd's actions, Mo Qingyun did not pay attention and released his soul force to perceive this array formation.

"Shengyang Qingguang Array!"

After sensing the array formation, Mo Qingyun recognized its origin and revealed a teasing smile.

Now that he knew the origin of the array formation, he had a way to enter it.

Immediately, Mo Qingyun moved his body and walked towards the front of the crowd, coming to a corner outside the array formation.

Mo Qingyun's appearance quickly caught everyone’s attention, puzzled as to why he ran up front.

"That kid! What does that boy want?"

While the crowd was examining Mo Qingyun, people from Xinghe Sect, Zhou Family, and Liuming Valley also noticed him, somewhat puzzled by his actions.

At this moment, when everyone was in doubt, Mo Qingyun took a step forward and directly passed through the array formation, entering its interior.

"That kid went in. Could it be that the entrance to the array is there? We should go through from that side too."

Seeing Mo Qingyun's actions, the crowd’s expressions immediately changed, showing shock and disbelief.

They had been pounding on it for a while without any reaction from the array formation, yet Mo Qingyun managed to enter so easily.

After this discovery, everyone rushed towards where Mo Qingyun entered the array formation, intending to enter as he did.

Bang bang bang...

However, when they approached the interior of the array formation, a counter-shock force threw them all out.

"How could this be? Why can that kid go in but we can't?"

"Everyone, use all your strength to break the array formation. We absolutely cannot let that kid monopolize the treasures inside."

"Yes, we must use all our strength to break through this array formation. We can't let that kid have the advantage."

...

For a moment, these people united in their anger and attacked the array formation fiercely once more.

As for what was happening outside, Mo Qingyun did not know. Entering the array formation, he quickly headed towards the peak of the mountain.

Soon, a chain bridge stretching nearly a thousand meters appeared before him. This was the path to the tower at the peak of the mountain.

Perhaps because this chain bridge had been abandoned for too long, most of the wooden planks on it had fallen off, leaving only a few bare iron chains.

After a brief hesitation, Mo Qingyun leaped onto the chain bridge and walked swiftly along it.

Boom!

At this moment, as Mo Qingyun was walking quickly, a loud sound came from outside the mountain peak.

Following this, a violent force wave swept over from outside, caused by the array formation being broken.

"The array formation has been broken!"

Upon hearing this, Mo Qingyun quickened his pace and rushed towards the other side of the chain bridge.

Soon, when Mo Qingyun was halfway across the chain bridge, the crowd outside caught up with him.

"Quickly look! That kid is on the chain bridge. We must catch up to him."

Seeing Mo Qingyun on the chain bridge, one person immediately shouted and rushed towards it.

Hearing this person's words, others quickly changed their expressions and hurriedly ran to the chain bridge.

Seeing everyone’s actions, Mo Qingyun narrowed his eyes and raised his hand to take out the Fire Silk Blade, slashing towards those behind him.

Snap snap snap...

With Mo Qingyun's one slash, the few wooden planks left on the chain bridge were instantly shattered into powder.

"You brat! You're looking for death!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun shatter the remaining wooden planks, everyone became furious.

Following this, while walking, Mo Qingyun continuously slashed the wooden planks behind him to slow down those following.

A few minutes later, Mo Qingyun reached the other side of the bridge and looked back at everyone with a teasing smile.

"Cut it off!"

Holding the Fire Silk Blade, Mo Qingyun slashed at one of the iron chains on the chain bridge.

Clang!

To his surprise, this slash did not sever the chain. More accurately, it left no trace on the iron chains.

"These chains are made of thousand-year-old mysterious iron. I was mistaken."

After this discovery, Mo Qingyun no longer hesitated and quickly headed towards the tower.

However, although he did not sever the chains, his slash caused them to vibrate violently.

This vibration made everyone on the bridge lose their footing, nearly falling into the abyss below.

This unexpected turn of events frightened everyone on the bridge. They looked at Mo Qingyun with extremely dark expressions, seething with anger.

They almost got wiped out by his one slash.

"Furnace Heaven Tower!"

Arriving in front of the tower, three ancient characters above the door caught Mo Qingyun's eye.

Those characters shimmered like flames, emitting a scorching heat wave.

Briefly scanning the tower's exterior, Mo Qingyun stepped into the Furnace Heaven Tower. Instantly, a powerful force wave pressed upon him.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun felt as if he were under the weight of several hundred pounds.

In addition to this, his body felt as if it were being cut by fiery blades.

When he noticed the pain on his skin, Mo Qingyun found that his body had been scorched by several wounds.

"There is both the Earth Essence and Fire Essence within this Furnace Heaven Tower."

Feeling the pressure of force and the scorching flames, Mo Qingyun frowned slightly, feeling surprised.

After a brief moment of surprise, he continued into the tower towards the stairs leading to the second floor.

Once inside the second floor, the pressure and scorching flames intensified slightly.

At the same time, Mo Qingyun felt that his actions were somewhat affected by these forces.

Although there was some impact on his mobility, he could still withstand this level of pressure.

The second floor of the Furnace Heaven Tower was much smaller than the first. However, it contained some bookshelves and scrolls.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate but stuffed all the books into his乾坤bag (Qian Kun Bag).

Moments later, he had collected all the books from the second floor into his乾坤bag.

After finishing this, Mo Qingyun stood up and headed towards the third floor of the Furnace Heaven Tower.

At this moment, some people caught up with him as he was about to enter the third floor.

"That kid is here. Don't let him escape."

Seeing Mo Qingyun sweep all the books from the second floor, these people shouted angrily.

Without hesitation, Mo Qingyun entered the third floor of the Furnace Heaven Tower.

"You can't escape, kid."

Seeing Mo Qingyun enter the third floor, these people were secretly furious and shouted from behind.

Chapter 115: Small Windfall()

Entering the third floor, the pressure and scorching flames intensified significantly.

Under this flame force, everything in the third floor appeared blurry and wobbly to Mo Qingyun.

Briefly observing the third floor, he noticed that its layout differed from the first and second floors.

The third floor was divided into several small rooms rather than being a single large hall.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun stepped inside and began searching for treasures.

Sizzle sizzle...

With each step he took, fiery blades sliced through his body, leaving wounds.

Blood surged wildly!

Realizing this, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and unleashed his martial soul神通 (Divine Skill).

With the release of his神通, his aura rose sharply, emitting a wave of fiery heat.

Under this flame force, the scorching flames inside the third floor caused him less harm.

Soon, Mo Qingyun entered the first room and saw a dazzling array of元灵石 (Nascent Soul Stones).

Millions upon millions of Nascent Soul Stones!

"Now I'm rich!"

Seeing the room filled with Nascent Soul Stones, Mo Qingyun was ecstatic.

Immediately, he began stuffing them into his乾坤bag (Qian Kun Bag).

A few minutes later, the Nascent Soul Stones in the first room were all collected.

Next, he headed towards the second room where hundreds of weapons were placed.

"Divine Armaments! There are even a few Treasure Armaments!"

Seeing the nearly thousand weapons, Mo Qingyun was delighted and his heart raced.

This was a big catch.

Thankfully he had been the first to arrive; otherwise, if someone else got here first, he might not have gotten any.

Taking these weapons back would greatly enhance Mo Family's overall strength.

With excitement, he quickly stuffed the weapons into his乾坤bag (Qian Kun Bag).

At this moment, as Mo Qingyun was rapidly collecting the weapons, a few people entered the room.

These individuals were somewhat familiar to Mo Qingyun; they were from Zhou Family.

"That kid!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun, these people looked surprised and then sternly said, "You escaped us a few times before. See if you can escape now."

Blocking the exit of the room, they prevented Mo Qingyun from escaping.

"Escape?"

Hearing their words, Mo Qingyun smiled teasingly. "Why should I escape? With just you few, what can you do to me?"

He had sensed their cultivation levels when they arrived; the leader was at True Qi Ninth Level, while others were at Eighth Level.

However, in this tower's third floor, their abilities would be greatly reduced.

Thus, they could only match True Qi Seventh or Eighth Level.

This level of strength posed little threat to Mo Qingyun currently.

"Hmph, you're quite arrogant. Do you think with your True Qi Fifth Level cultivation, you can still resist us?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, the True Qi Ninth Level person from Zhou Family responded with disdain.

"Brother Yan, why are you wasting words with this kid? Just strike him down."

"Yes, let's strike him down and take these weapons. Otherwise, others will snatch them away."

...

At this moment, the people behind Zhou Yan spoke up.

"Fiery Demon Bee!"

Hearing their words, Zhou Yan summoned his martial soul.

Then a several-meter-long green and red giant bee appeared above him, flapping its spotted wings.

"Swarming Demon Bees!"

After summoning his martial soul, Zhou Yan raised his hand and struck Mo Qingyun with a palm full of True Qi.

This burst of True Qi transformed into numerous fist-sized bee images, rapidly approaching Mo Qingyun.

At this moment, these fist-sized True Qi bees swarmed towards Mo Qingyun like a storm of demon bees.

"Fire Dragon Seal!"

Seeing the rapidly approaching swarm, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and summoned twenty-seven True Qi Seals, powerfully striking forward.

The twenty-seven seals instantly transformed into a massive fiery shield and struck ahead.

Whizz whizz...

Under the impact of the fiery shield, the bee images collided like moths to a flame, producing sounds akin to darts hitting a shield.

"Mountain-Cleaving Fire Blade!"

After unleashing the Fire Dragon Seal, Mo Qingyun did not pause and slashed at Zhou Yan with his Fire Silk Blade.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun's aura radiated without reservation.

He appeared like a war god, wielding a two-meter-long blade and charging towards Zhou Yan with overwhelming force.

True Qi Ninth Level!

Feeling Mo Qingyun's aura, Zhou Yan and his companions were shocked, their eyes wide in disbelief.

Over ten days ago when they first entered here, Mo Qingyun was only at True Qi Fifth Level.

But in just a short time, his cultivation had reached True Qi Ninth Level.

This rapid advancement was terrifying to them.

"No... Impossible, your cultivation can't have reached True Qi Ninth Level."

Zhou Yan was agitated and shook his head, unable to accept this reality.

However, while shocked, he raised a palm towards Mo Qingyun and roared, "Kid, even if your cultivation is at True Qi Ninth Level, you'll still die now."

"Demon Bee Nest!"

Zhou Yan then unleashed his martial soul神通 (Divine Skill), and a massive black bee nest appeared in front of Mo Qingyun.

Buzz!

As soon as the bee nest appeared, nearly a hundred fist-sized images of bees flew out.

These images were much more powerful than the ones from his martial technique.

Sensing them briefly, Mo Qingyun found that each of these hundred images had the power of a True Qi High Level person's full strike.

"Cut them down!"

Seeing the rapidly approaching hundreds of images, Mo Qingyun slashed without hesitation.

At this moment, he could not hesitate any longer.

Some of the images near his blade were shattered in mid-air, and the bee nest was also split.

After splitting the nest, Mo Qingyun continued his attack towards Zhou Yan.

Of course, he was stung by a few images during this process and felt a swelling pain.

"You... You're crazy!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun resist his martial soul神通 (Divine Skill) and slash towards him without retreating, Zhou Yan was terrified.

Splat!

Just as he was in terror, Mo Qingyun's Fire Silk Blade fell and cleaved him in two.

"You... You killed Brother Yan!"

Seeing Zhou Yan cut down by Mo Qingyun, the other Zhou Family members were terrified.

"Cut them down!"

Ignoring their reactions, Mo Qingyun slashed towards them with his Fire Silk Blade.

"Quickly run! Let's find Brother Tao!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun charging towards them, they turned and fled.

What could they do? Even Zhou Yan was no match for Mo Qingyun, let alone them.

Fighting him would be like seeking death.

Splat!

As they fled, two of them were cut down by Mo Qingyun's blade and fell with a look of despair.

After killing these two, Mo Qingyun left the room and continued chasing after the remaining Zhou Family members.

As he chased them, Mo Qingyun saw many people had already arrived on the third floor.

These individuals rushed into various rooms, frenziedly collecting treasures.

Ignoring them, Mo Qingyun continued chasing the two ahead while heading towards the fourth floor.

At this moment, as he was about to catch up with them, Zhou Tao and others arrived.

"Brother Tao! Quickly save us. He... he killed Brother Yan."

Seeing Zhou Tao, the remaining members looked relieved and pleaded for help.

Chapter 116: Freely Slaying()

"Brother Yan is dead!"

Hearing their words, Zhou Tao and others were shocked.

They knew Brother Yan's strength; they couldn't believe he was killed by Mo Qingyun.

"You're looking for death, daring to harm our Zhou Family."

Zhou Tao's face darkened, his fists clenched tightly. Veins on his neck bulged as he glared at Mo Qingyun.

"Are Zhou Family people so impressive?"

Mo Qingyun glanced disdainfully at them. "Moreover, I've killed Zhou Family people before; what can you do to me?"

Hearing this, Zhou Tao's eyes bulged with fury. "You think you can get away with killing my younger brother by sneaking up on him? You're naive."

"Sneak attack?"

Mo Qingyun narrowed his eyes and looked at them teasingly. "You overestimate yourselves; killing you doesn't require such tactics."

"Fiery Heaven Dragon, appear!"

With that, Mo Qingyun summoned his martial soul.

Roar!

A loud dragon roar echoed from the twenty-meter-long Fiery Heaven Dragon martial soul.

As this roar rang out, everyone on the third floor was shocked and their hearts trembled.

"Heaven... Heaven Dragon Martial Soul!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun's martial soul, everyone was stunned with shock.

They didn't expect him to possess a Heaven Dragon Martial Soul.

Even the weakest type of Heaven Dragon is a Super Martial Soul, so Mo Qingyun must have one.

With the Fiery Heaven Dragon's soul force enhancement, the fire essence in the third floor had minimal impact on Mo Qingyun.

"Swift Shadow Step!"

Mo Qingyun moved swiftly like the wind, wielding his Fire Silk Blade and charging towards Zhou Tao and others.

Seeing Mo Qingyun charge at them, Zhou Tao gritted his teeth and snarled. "Kid, even with your Super Martial Soul, you must die today."

To him, Mo Qingyun's actions were a sign of disdain and contempt.

"Mountain-Cleaving Fire Blade!"

Ignoring Zhou Tao's anger, Mo Qingyun leaped ten meters away and slashed at them from above.

The Fire Silk Blade surged with True Qi, forming a five-meter-long blade of light that struck towards Zhou Family members.

"Fiery Giant Lizard!"

"Ice Freezing Blue Ape!"

...

Seeing Mo Qingyun attack them, Zhou Tao and others summoned their martial souls.

"Jade Claw!"

"Heavenly Axe!"

"Ghost Hand of Light..."

...

After summoning their martial souls, they quickly retaliated.

Boom boom boom...

As the blade of light clashed with ice claws and axes, the sky darkened and a powerful True Qi wave swept out.

Facing this wave, Mo Qingyun and others rapidly retreated.

"You can't be a match for us with just one person."

Seeing they easily blocked Mo Qingyun's attack, Zhou Tao and others looked smug.

"Is that so?"

Mo Qingyun smirked. "You think you can handle me with just one person? Let's see."

He then produced a small black box.

"Bursting Rain Seal Needles, shoot!"

This box contained the Bursting Rain Seal Needles he obtained from Jiang Guardian.

Sizzle sizzle...

Pressing a mechanism, numerous tiny needles shot out with a whizzing sound.

Sizzle sizzle...

Close to Zhou Family members, the needles struck them unexpectedly.

"Ouch..."

Struck by the needles, Zhou Family members cried out in pain.

"What's happening? Why is my blood flow suddenly obstructed?"

"These are Bursting Rain Seal Needles. They seal the acupuncture points, causing blood flow to be blocked."

"My cultivation is weakening; what can I do?"

...

Feeling the changes in their bodies, Zhou Family members panicked.

Seeing them struck by Mo Qingyun's Bursting Rain Seal Needles, Zhou Tao looked furious. "You're a sneak! Using hidden weapons!"

"Sneak?"

Mo Qingyun smiled disdainfully. "What's wrong with using hidden weapons? This isn't a friendly match; it's life and death. Haven't you heard of 'all is fair in love and war'? You're a fool!"

"You..."

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, Zhou Tao was furious.

Seeing his expression, Mo Qingyun said. "Moreover, you're so many against one; isn't that unfair?"

"Soul Heaven Seal!"

Mo Qingyun then summoned eighteen soul seals and struck towards them.

The grayish seals shot out like meteors, striking Zhou Family members.

"Ouch..."

Struck by the soul seals, Zhou Family members cried out and trembled.

"You're a coward! Facing me head-on is better than using hidden tactics."

Suppressing the pain in his mind, Zhou Tao glared at Mo Qingyun with a fierce look.

"Coward?"

Mo Qingyun ignored him. "What's so great about being a brave man? I'll slaughter all of you with just one person, much better than being a brave man."

"Mountain-Cleaving Fire Blade!"

Mo Qingyun then slashed at Zhou Family members with his Fire Silk Blade.

His movements were swift, almost like lightning.

These weakened Zhou Family members first struck by Bursting Rain Seal Needles and then soul seals.

Before they could react, Mo Qingyun's blade was already near them.

Splat...

Without any reaction, he slashed and killed several people.

"Kid, stop!"

Seeing his family members being slain, Zhou Tao roared and charged at Mo Qingyun.

Mo Qingyun moved aside and slashed at other people.

Now, Zhou Family members' cultivation was reduced to eighty percent due to Bursting Rain Seal Needles.

Facing Mo Qingyun's fierce attacks, they were almost wiped out without any resistance.

In a moment, several more Zhou Family members were slain by Mo Qingyun's powerful strikes.

Thud thud...

As Mo Qingyun was freely slaying, footsteps rapidly approached.

He saw several groups of people quickly approaching.

It was the people from Liuming Valley and Xinghe Sect. Seeing them, Zhou Tao said, "Lu Yang, Yu Chuan, come help me and strike this kid down."

"This kid..."

Seeing Zhou Family's惨状 (cruel fate), people from Xinghe Sect and Liuming Valley were stunned, unable to believe their eyes.

Zhou Family's strength was so great yet they were being slaughtered by Mo Qingyun, nearly ten family members slain.

"Alright!"

After a brief moment of shock, people from Xinghe Sect and Liuming Valley joined Zhou Family to fight Mo Qingyun.

"Again, outnumbering him?"

Seeing them join, Mo Qingyun smiled teasingly. "This battle is over for now; I'll come back to take your lives."

With that, he dashed into the stairs leading to the fourth floor and rushed up.

Confident in his strength but not arrogant, he didn't want to risk facing three groups alone.

"Kid, you can't escape!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun flee, the three groups chased after him towards the fourth floor stairs.

Chapter 117: Deception? (Third Update)()

Entering the fourth floor, Mo Qingyun felt a terrifying gravitational force pressing down on him.

Boom!

Under this pressure, he stumbled and his foot landed heavily with a loud sound.

Then his body leaned forward, half-kneeling on the ground.

"Such strong Earth Essence can generate such pressure; it must be at least Fifth Level."

Feeling the gravitational force, Mo Qingyun's face darkened and he sighed inwardly.

After adapting to the environment, he gritted his teeth and slowly moved forward.

With each step, he felt the gravitational force increasing.

"Not good; if this continues, I'll be crushed by the Earth Essence."

After moving a distance, he realized he needed to find a solution.

At this moment, Zhou Tao and others caught up and arrived at the fourth floor entrance.

Seeing Mo Qingyun still in the fourth floor, they looked smug and sneered.

"You can't escape. This time we'll definitely kill you."

Entering the fourth floor, they were immediately hit by a terrifying gravitational force.

Bang bang bang...

Caught off guard, Zhou Tao and others were pressed to the ground.

Plop...

Some weaker people coughed blood, their faces pale.

Such terrifying gravitational force!

Feeling the weight like a mountain on them, Zhou Tao and others were shocked.

Now they understood why Mo Qingyun remained in the fourth floor instead of going to the fifth.

Under such pressure, it was hard to even stand, let alone walk.

"True Qi Eighth Level and below, retreat to the third floor."

Seeing this, Lu Yang and others instructed some people to go back.

Those with weaker cultivation retreated to the third floor.

With them gone, Zhou Tao and others struggled forward towards Mo Qingyun.

"You can run? See if you can run in this gravitational force."

Seeing the distance closing, they felt smug.

"Run? Why should I run?"

Mo Qingyun shrugged and took out the Bursting Rain Seal Needles, smiling teasingly. "I'm standing here; come and see."

"Bursting Rain Seal Needles, retreat!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun's small black box, Zhou Tao and others retreated.

They didn't want to be hit by the Bursting Rain Seal Needles.

With their current cultivation, they could barely move in the fourth floor.

If hit by Bursting Rain Seal Needles, their strength would be affected and they might crawl.

Moreover, Mo Qingyun would take advantage of them.

How could they resist his attacks if they couldn't even stand?

"Useless bunch, a box scares you like this."

Seeing their reaction, Mo Qingyun looked at them disdainfully.

He hadn't lied; he had used up the Bursting Rain Seal Needles earlier.

But Zhou Tao and others sneered, "Kid, don't think you can fool us with Bursting Rain Seal Needles. Deception won't work."

"Deception won't work?"

Mo Qingyun smiled teasingly, "How can you be sure I don't have Bursting Rain Seal Needles? If I do, wouldn't it be unfair for you to get scared?"

Lu Yang and others sneered, "Better safe than sorry."

"These guys are really afraid of being bitten by a snake for ten years after one bite."

Mo Qingyun sighed inwardly and sat down to感悟 (comprehend) the Earth Essence in the fourth floor.

He knew he needed to comprehend the Earth Essence to enter the fifth floor.

Otherwise, the pressure would increase and he might not even crawl.

Seeing Mo Qingyun sitting down, Zhou Tao and others also sat down, glaring at him with resentment.

They were now in a stalemate.

Mo Qingyun closed his eyes to comprehend the Earth Essence while sensing the surroundings with a thread of soul force.

Though Zhou Tao and others didn't attack, he couldn't be sure they wouldn't when he was in meditation.

"Hmph! Kid, do you think pretending to meditate can fool us? Dream on!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun in meditation, Zhou Tao and others sneered.

"We won't fall for your tricks. You're far from matching us in strategy."

"Let's meditate too!"

They took out pills and entered meditation.

Everyone knew that whoever broke through first would gain the upper hand.

The next days passed in meditation.

Ten days later, Mo Qingyun and Zhou Tao were still in a stalemate.

Suddenly, a mysterious force appeared around Mo Qingyun, opposing the Earth Essence in the fourth floor.
