“Sir, let’s talk reasonably. We don’t want this place anymore.”

Upon hearing Chih Lian's words, Elder Hua immediately showed a bitter expression and submitted to Chih Lian.

“Just now when you were fighting us for this place, it wasn’t like this. You acted霸道when you could win and begged when you couldn’t. How nice it is.”

Moz Qingyun sneered at Elder Hua’s words.

Bang!

Facing Chih Lian's full strength, Elder Hua was almost powerless and was sent flying by a palm strike from Chih Lian, spewing blood.

“Elder Hua!”

Seeing Elder Hua being sent flying by Chih Lian, the people from Liuming Valley all showed expressions of shock and fearfully looked at Chih Lian.

As for the other people around, they also showed expressions of awe. Those who had thoughts of bullying Moz Qingyun and his companions instantly dispelled those ideas.

A Second Stage Core Formation realm expert, unless in a dire situation, it’s better not to make enemies with them.

At this moment, when everyone was in awe of Chih Lian's formidable strength, a cold snort came from the front of the crowd: "So it was you who killed my Zhou family’s people. You dared to come here after killing them, quite bold."

"These fellows are really brave; they even dare to kill Zhou family’s people!"

Hearing the words of the Zhou family, those around them changed their expressions and were shocked.

As for the people from Liuming Valley who wanted to occupy Moz Qingyun’s place earlier, their faces turned pale and they were still in a state of shock.

Moz Qingyun’s group dared to kill Zhou family’s people, let alone them. They could only consider themselves lucky to still be alive now.

When the Zhou family showed signs of anger, an elder in their group exclaimed: "Eh, that’s Yue Ying!"

After the exclamation, the elder walked towards Yue Ying and smiled: "Yue Ying, who are these two?"

"Reporting to Elder Wu, these two are my friends."

Yue Ying showed a respectful expression and responded with a bow, introducing Moz Qingyun and Chih Lian.

"Oh, it’s Brother Chih Lian and Younger Brother Qingyun."

Elder Wu smiled and greeted Moz Qingyun and Chih Lian, then said: "Since these two are Yue Ying’s friends, they’re also our Star River Sect’s friends. If you don’t mind, come with us."

After seeing Chih Lian's skills earlier, Elder Wu had already harbored an intention to recruit him.

Moreover, Moz Qingyun’s group killing Zhou family’s people also made them allies.

If they could recruit Chih Lian and Moz Qingyun into Star River Sect, it would be a good thing.

A Second Stage Core Formation realm expert is a great help to a force like Star River Sect.

"These two fellows are really lucky, they’ve gained the favor of Star River Sect."

"But, they dared to kill Zhou family’s people; their future won’t be easy."

"From what we see, these two will probably join Star River Sect. But it’s not bad to enter Star River Sect."

...

The people around started whispering again.

"Wu Shexin, what do you mean? You’re protecting the people we Zhou family wants to kill. Are you going to break with us?"

Seeing Wu Shexin’s actions, the Zhou family elder immediately showed a stern expression and said with gritted teeth.

"Wu Gengqing, are you scaring me? So what if we break with each other? Are we Zhou family afraid of Star River Sect?"

Wu Shexin sneered and looked at Wu Gengqing with disdain.

Seeing this, Moz Qingyun and Chih Lian both smiled faintly without saying much.

At this moment, with Star River Sect stepping in, it was the best. Firstly, they could keep some of their trump cards, and secondly, they could avoid unnecessary trouble.

Thump thump...

Just as the Zhou family and Star River Sect were on the verge of conflict, the ground suddenly shook.

Then everyone saw that the gate of Fentian Sect slowly emerged from underground.

The ruins of Fentian Sect were about to be unearthed.

Seeing this, everyone’s expressions changed and they showed excited looks.

Once the gate was unearthed and opened, they could enter to seek their fortune.

Fentian Sect is an ancient sect with Heavenly Rank martial arts and cultivation techniques. Moreover, Fentian Sect has many treasures, medicinal pills, and weapons.

After a moment, a gate over ninety meters high appeared before everyone’s eyes.

Above the gate were three ancient characters: Fentian Sect.

Clank clank...

As the sect was unearthed, a chain pulling sound came from underground.

At the same time, that ninety-meter-high and dozens-of-meters-wide gate slowly opened, releasing an ancient and沧桑气息.

"We’re going in!"

As soon as the Fentian Sect gate opened, someone rushed towards it.

At the same time, some True Qi realm martial artists who were not giving up also followed behind to mix in.

Ah...

Just as these True Qi realm martial artists approached the gate, they were directly cut by a flame blade and instantly turned to ashes.

"Ts!"

Seeing this, everyone’s expressions twitched and their hearts shook.

Those True Qi realm martial artists who were trying to mix in also turned pale, feeling fearful and regretful.

Fortunately, it wasn’t them who rushed in just now; otherwise, they would have been dead for sure.

"Let’s go in too!"

As most people entered, the person leading Star River Sect’s younger generation said indifferently: "Let's go in."

Then they successively entered Fentian Sect.

Seeing this, Elder Wu Shexin smiled at Moz Qingyun and said: "Young friend, you can go with Luo Yang’s group. This way, you’ll have someone to look out for you."

"Thanks for Elder Wu’s kindness."

Hearing Wu Shexin’s words, Moz Qingyun didn’t say much and followed the group into Fentian Sect.

...

Upon entering Fentian Sect, Moz Qingyun felt a wave of heat hit him.

At this moment, he had the feeling that Fentian Sect was built on a huge furnace.

Feeling the surrounding flame power, Moz Qingyun’s expression changed and he sighed inwardly: "Such rich flame power. Fentian Sect chose a good place."

From the attributes of Fentian Sect’s cultivation techniques and martial arts, establishing their sect here would make cultivation twice as effective.

"Humph! Kid, now that the Second Stage Core Formation realm person is no longer protecting you, see how you’ll escape."

As Moz Qingyun was observing his surroundings, a mocking voice came from the side.

Then he saw the younger generation of Zhou family approaching with amused smiles on their faces.

"Kid, if I were you, I would have left the Fentian Sect ruins earlier. You shouldn’t have come in foolishly."

After Zhou family’s younger generation spoke, Liuming Valley’s younger generation also approached with mocking smiles.

At this moment, Moz Qingyun and Star River Sect’s younger generation were surrounded by these two groups.

Seeing this, the younger generation of Star River Sect looked at each other in confusion, not knowing what to do.

They didn’t know whether they should protect Moz Qingyun or let him go.

If they let him go, it would seem to contradict Elder Wu’s instructions. But if they protected Moz Qingyun, with their strength, it seemed that they couldn’t be the match of Zhou family and Liuming Valley.

This dilemma made them feel a bit headache for a moment.

Seeing the situation, one of Zhou family’s younger generation showed a mocking expression and said to Luo Yang with a hint of threat: "Luo Yang, you should be clear about the current situation. Don’t let this outsider’s kid put your Star River Sect people in a precarious position."

"Star River Sect, if you hand over this kid to us, we’ll be grateful."

At the same time, one of Liuming Valley’s people also spoke to Star River Sect.

Hearing Zhou family and Liuming Valley’s words, Luo Yang from Star River Sect frowned slightly and thought silently.

Seeing Luo Yang silent, the people of Star River Sect were tense, waiting for Luo Yang’s decision.

As for Zhou family and Liuming Valley people on the side, they looked at Luo Yang with mocking expressions as if they had him in their grasp.

After a moment, Luo Yang’s expression darkened and he seemed to have made up his mind. He looked at Moz Qingyun and said: "Kid, originally your life or death has nothing to do with me. But I promised Elder Wu to protect you. Now, if you self-destruct your cultivation, I’ll ask Zhou family and Liuming Valley to spare your life."

"Self-destruct my cultivation, ask for mercy, and spare my life?"

Hearing Luo Yang’s words, Moz Qingyun looked at him disdainfully, extremely contemptuous of him.

In this world where martial power is supreme, once a person loses their cultivation, it’s better to die.

"Zhou Tao, Liuming Valley people, what do you think of my suggestion?" Luo Yang asked coldly.

Hearing Luo Yang’s words, Zhou family and Liuming Valley people exchanged glances and replied with a faint smile: "Haha, since Luo Yang said so, we’ll give some face. As long as this kid self-destructs his cultivation, we’ll spare him."

"Alright!"

Hearing Zhou family and Liuming Valley people agree with his suggestion, Luo Yang looked at Moz Qingyun coldly and said: "Kid, you must have heard what everyone just said. Self-destruct your cultivation."

"Self-destruct my cultivation?"

Hearing Luo Yang’s commanding tone, Moz Qingyun sneered and said: "Should I thank you for asking for mercy on my behalf?"

"Huh?"

Hearing Moz Qingyun’s slightly sarcastic words, Luo Yang’s expression darkened and he said: "No need to thank me. I promised Elder Wu to protect you, it’s my duty."

"Protect me?"

Hearing Luo Yang’s words, Moz Qingyun looked at him with even more contempt and said: "This kind of protection, I think we can do without. If being protected means self-destructing my cultivation, I’d rather not have this protection."

Is this kid crazy?

Seeing Moz Qingyun’s actions, everyone was stunned and couldn’t believe what they saw.

Originally, Star River Sect was the only side that could protect him. Now he even offended them; is he looking for death?

"Luo Yang, it seems this kid doesn’t buy your account."

Hearing Moz Qingyun’s words, Zhou Tao from the side stirred up trouble.

Seeing everyone’s mocking looks and hearing Zhou Tao’s words, Luo Yang said with a狰狞 expression: "Kid, think clearly. Without my protection, you’ll die without a whole body next time."

"About that, I don’t need to worry about it."

Moz Qingyun responded indifferently: "If you self-destruct your cultivation now, I can protect you."

"Kid, you’re looking for death!"

Hearing Moz Qingyun’s mocking words, Luo Yang’s expression darkened and he said with gritted teeth: "Kid, you’re looking for death!"

Then Luo Yang raised his hand and fiercely struck at Moz Qingyun.

"Interesting!"

Seeing this, Zhou family and Liuming Valley people showed amused smiles and watched silently.

Soul Heaven Seal

Facing Luo Yang’s attack, Moz Qingyun didn’t hold back and directly summoned eighteen soul battle seals to strike at Luo Yang.

As the eighteen soul battle seals appeared, they turned into a streak of light and directly struck Luo Yang’s head, severely injuring his soul.

Puh!

After being hit by the eighteen soul battle seals, Luo Yang cried out in pain, his face turned pale and he spewed blood.

Seeing this scene, everyone was stunned, unable to believe it was real.

Luo Yang with Perfect True Qi realm cultivation was severely injured and spewed blood in a battle against Moz Qingyun, who is at Fifth Stage True Qi realm.

This result was beyond everyone’s expectations.

Shadow Swift Step

Without hesitation, Moz Qingyun used Shadow Swift Step and fled far away, saying coldly: "Zhou family, Liuming Valley, Star River Sect, the grudge of today will be returned to you double tomorrow."

Moz Qingyun knew clearly that in this situation, even if he had many skills, it was unrealistic to fight against so many people with just one person.

As the saying goes, a gentleman’s revenge is not in haste. As long as there are mountains to rely on, one doesn’t fear no firewood. He would slowly settle the account later.

"Quickly chase, don’t let that kid escape."

Seeing Moz Qingyun flee, Zhou Tao and others immediately shouted in alarm and chased after him.

But when they chased, they found that Moz Qingyun’s speed was too fast for them to catch up.

"That... That kid has comprehended the essence of wind."

"How is this possible? A Fifth Stage True Qi realm person comprehending the essence of power, how did this kid do it?"

"There must be a big secret on that kid’s body. We can’t let him escape!"

...

Discovering that Moz Qingyun had comprehended the essence of power, everyone was shocked.

Then they chased after him at full speed, wanting to catch him.

...

After about an hour, Moz Qingyun completely shook off the people from Star River Sect, Zhou family, and Liuming Valley.

After getting rid of these three forces’ people, Moz Qingyun started searching for treasures and released his soul power to search.

Now, Moz Qingyun’s soul cultivation had entered the peak of Middle Stage Soul Shape realm. Fully releasing his soul power, he could sense everything within a hundred meters.

Under Moz Qingyun’s full perception with his soul power, he soon discovered some good things.

Two hundred-year-old Fourth Rank Spirit Medicine Fire Comb Grass,

Two hundred-year-old Fourth Rank Spirit Medicine Crimson Enriching Firm Fruit,

Three hundred-year-old Fourth Rank Spirit Medicine Whirlwind Rock Heart Grass,

...

At this moment, dozens of precious spirit medicines appeared in Moz Qingyun’s perception.

After such a discovery, Moz Qingyun didn’t hesitate and immediately went there.

In no time, he arrived at the place with a pleased expression, lifted his hand and put these spirit medicines into his bag.

"Kid, you can’t take these spirit medicines."

At the moment when Moz Qingyun was collecting the spirit medicines, a low voice came from not far away.

Then he saw a man and a woman slowly approaching him.

These two people weren’t very strong, the man was at Sixth Stage True Qi realm and the woman was at Fifth Stage True Qi realm.

"Why can’t I?"

Moz Qingyun asked playfully, but his actions didn’t slow down at all.

The two people sized up Moz Qingyun. The man hesitated for a moment and said: "As the saying goes, those who see it should share. We two also saw these spirit medicines, so they should be divided into three parts. You take one part and we two take the other two."

"Those who see it should share?"

Hearing their words, Moz Qingyun’s gaze swept over the woman and said with a playful smile: "So you also saw this girl next to you. Shouldn’t she be shared too?"

"Kid, don’t overstep your bounds. How can these two things be mixed up?"

Hearing this, the man’s expression darkened and he clenched his fists, glaring at Moz Qingyun.

But perhaps considering that Moz Qingyun wasn’t weak, he didn’t dare to act immediately.

"Let me share a woman and you don’t want it, what right do you have to let me share these spirit medicines with you?"

Moz Qingyun responded disdainfully, somewhat impatiently: "I’m in a good mood now and don’t want to kill. If you don’t want to die, leave immediately."

"Brother, this kid is too arrogant. Let’s not waste words with him and just kill him."

The woman looked at Moz Qingyun disdainfully and said to the man.

Hearing his companion’s words, the man immediately got angry and said: "Kid, I’ve given you a chance. If you don’t cherish it, don’t blame me for being ruthless."

Azure Heaven Flying Scorpion, appear!

The man spoke and summoned his martial soul.

Then a huge black scorpion with wings appeared above his body.

Moon Slash Electric Sparrow, appear!

Following the man, the woman also summoned her martial soul.

Then a blue bird with electric arcs appeared above her body.

These two people’s martial souls weren’t very powerful, just Seventh Rank martial souls. It seemed that the forces behind them were ordinary.

Seeing their actions, Moz Qingyun smiled disdainfully and said: "Since you want to die, I’ll make it happen for you."

Furnace Sun Mountain-Splitting Saber

Moz Qingyun spoke and directly attacked them, flipping his hand into a palm saber and slashing at the two.

Then a five-meter-long red true qi blade slashed towards them with lightning speed.

"Good... Good terrifying martial arts!"

Seeing Moz Qingyun’s attack, the two people immediately changed their expressions and looked terrified.

"Brother... Brother, be merciful. I agree with what you said about sharing. My woman can let you..."

Seeing that powerful saber falling, the man immediately pushed his woman in front of him and begged.

"Sister, you..."

Seeing the man’s actions, the woman was also panic-stricken and looked at the rapidly approaching saber blade in despair.

The sudden change made her unprepared, and she was hit by the saber blade.

Puh!

When the saber blade fell, both of them were not spared and were cut in half by it.

Moz Qingyun looked at the dead two people indifferently, with no emotion on his face.

He had seen too many such backstabbing and untrustworthy acts.

After collecting the remaining spirit medicines, Moz Qingyun teleported away to continue searching for treasures.

During his search, he also encountered some people with ulterior motives and killed them all.

After a day of frenzied searching, Moz Qingyun’s harvest was quite rich.

But under the continuous release of his soul power, his soul power consumption was also huge, making him somewhat uncomfortable.

Therefore, Moz Qingyun temporarily stopped searching for spirit medicines and found a quiet place to recover his soul power.

At the same time, he took out some spirit medicines and started refining pills.

After searching for a while, his resources were quite rich now. He even had the materials to refine Fifth Rank pills.

After this discovery, Moz Qingyun didn’t hesitate and took out the spirit medicines one by one to start refining pills.

This time, he planned to refine Fifth Rank pills, the Void Essence True Qi Pill.

After taking out the spirit medicines one by one, Moz Qingyun took out the Crimson Flame Cauldron and infused it with a soul flame.

Then he threw all the spirit medicines into the cauldron and started refining pills.

Under the refinement of the soul flame, the spirit medicines in the cauldron were quickly purified and refined.

After several hours, all the spirit medicines were refined into green medicinal liquids.

Then Moz Qingyun didn’t hesitate and started forming pills.

After about a quarter of an hour, the aroma of the pill came from the cauldron. The pills were successfully refined.

Opening the cauldron, nineteen pills quietly lay inside.

"Fifth Rank Middle Stage, nineteen pills. Not bad."

Seeing the pills in the cauldron, Moz Qingyun smiled contentedly and lifted his hand to put the pills into his bag.

After refining the pills, Moz Qingyun didn’t rush to continue searching for treasures. Instead, he took out a pill and started refining it.

In his view, his current cultivation was still somewhat weak.

If he encountered Seventh Stage or Eighth Stage True Qi realm people, he could handle them easily. Even a Ninth Stage True Qi realm person with all his cards on the table, he could barely handle.

But if he encountered several Ninth Stage True Qi realm or above people, his situation would be somewhat unfavorable and he could only escape with his tail between his legs.

Moz Qingyun knew clearly that as they continued to explore the ruins, the chances of encountering Zhou family, Star River Sect, and Liuming Valley people would increase greatly.

To prevent the incident at Fentian Sect from happening again, he planned to advance his cultivation further.

After the Void Essence True Qi Pill entered his mouth, it immediately turned into pure medicinal power and flowed into Moz Qingyun’s meridians, being slowly refined by him.

After a day, Moz Qingyun completely refined and absorbed one Void Essence True Qi Pill.

After refining the Void Essence True Qi Pill, Moz Qingyun’s cultivation successfully advanced from Fifth Stage Initial True Qi realm to Fifth Stage Late True Qi realm.

Seeing this, Moz Qingyun didn’t hesitate and continued refining Void Essence True Qi Pills to advance his cultivation.

This way, eight days passed.

At this moment, with a pleased expression, Moz Qingyun opened his eyes while in cultivation.

"True Qi Seventh Stage!"

Feeling the surging true qi within him, Moz Qingyun was delighted. He finally entered the high stage of True Qi realm.

After entering the high stage of True Qi realm, he felt that his strength had improved qualitatively.

Now he was confident that if he encountered Luo Yang again, even without using any skills, he could fight him.

"Since my cultivation has advanced, it’s time to continue searching for treasures."

Moz Qingyun stood up with an expectant expression and headed towards the deeper parts of Fentian Sect.

...

As he went along, Moz Qingyun fully released his soul power to sense the surroundings.

After some effort, he finally made a major discovery.

"Middle Rank Treasure Weapon!"

Under the perception of his soul power, Moz Qingyun discovered a hidden secret room with several decent weapons stored inside.

After this discovery, he didn’t hesitate and hurried towards the secret room.

"There’s an array!"

A moment later, Moz Qingyun arrived at the entrance of the secret room and looked at the array patterns in front of him, his brows furrowed.

It seemed that to obtain these treasure weapons, he would need to put in some effort.

Then Moz Qingyun started studying the array and looking for ways to break it.

Although he wasn’t good at arrays, he had some knowledge. He was confident in breaking this array.

After a while of studying, Moz Qingyun recognized the origin of the array.

"Thunder Sun Holy Light Array!"

A faint smile appeared on Moz Qingyun’s lips as he knew the method to break it and raised his hand to break the array.

After a moment, after Moz Qingyun’s efforts, the array was finally broken.

Swoosh!

A dazzling light flashed rapidly, moving along each array pattern quickly.

After the streak of light moved through all the patterns, the entire array suddenly shone and disappeared into thin air.

Clang clang clang...

Without the suppression of the array, the treasure weapon inside the secret room started trembling and emitting metallic sounds like a wild horse.

This treasure weapon was a long saber, about two meters in length with one meter of blade and one meter of handle. It emitted阵阵热浪, impressive.

"Such a powerful treasure weapon! With this weapon, the power of my Furnace Sun Mountain-Splitting Saber will be greatly increased."

Seeing this red long saber, Moz Qingyun showed a look of wild joy. The power of the treasure weapon exceeded his expectations.

Then Moz Qingyun entered the secret room and took the red long saber in hand.

"Fire Silk Saber!"

Looking at the handle, he saw several ancient characters carved on it.

Slash!

Moz Qingyun slashed the Fire Silk Saber at a nearby wall, instantly collapsing it.

"Not bad!"

Seeing this, Moz Qingyun took the saber and walked out of the secret room, planning to continue searching for treasures.

"Right there! That dazzling light came from here."

"There must be a treasure appearing. Otherwise, such an anomaly wouldn’t happen."

"From what I see, it’s likely a powerful weapon unearthed. We’re lucky this time."

...

As Moz Qingyun was about to leave, excited voices came from the distance.

Then he saw a group of people rushing towards him quickly.

"Don’t let that kid escape, the treasure was taken by him."

Seeing Moz Qingyun, one of them reminded everyone.

Hearing this person’s words, the others changed their expressions and looked at Moz Qingyun with greedy eyes.

"Huh? Kid, it’s you!"

At this moment, a surprised voice came from the crowd. It seemed he recognized Moz Qingyun.

This person was none other than someone from Liuming Valley.

"Liuming Valley people!"

Seeing the others, Moz Qingyun’s lips curled into a playful smile.

He was just worried about not finding them to take revenge, and now they had come to him.

Only, what surprised Moz Qingyun was that the Liuming Valley people in front of him were only a small part of them.

It seemed everyone had separated after entering the ruins, searching for treasures separately.

But this was also good for Moz Qingyun. He could eliminate them one by one.

"Kid, last time you escaped侥幸ly, this time we’ll see where you run."

The Liuming Valley people all showed smug expressions and looked at Moz Qingyun with sneers, as if he was a lamb to be slaughtered.

Another Liuming Valley person said: "Kid, if I were you, I would find a place to hide and not come out randomly. But now it’s too late for you to regret."

"Haha, is that so?"

Moz Qingyun smiled indifferently at Liuming Valley’s words: "If I were you, I would escape immediately and not stay to be sacrificed by me."

"Didn’t you hear him? This kid said he would sacrifice us."

Hearing Moz Qingyun’s words, some of the Liuming Valley people laughed disdainfully.

"Haha, what a foolish kid. I think he’s scared out of his wits."

After their words, the rest of Liuming Valley people also laughed.

At this moment, as Moz Qingyun and Liuming Valley people were facing off, some other passersby were attracted.

"Look, those are Liuming Valley people. They seem to be dealing with a kid."

"I know that kid. Before he came in, he had conflicts with Liuming Valley people. It’s really a case of冤家路窄."

"From the current situation, that kid is doomed. But the saber in his hand looks pretty good."

"That’s a treasure weapon. It’s surprising that this kid has such an item, but it will be a pity for Liuming Valley people to get it later."

...

After the others arrived, they couldn’t help but sigh.

At this moment, one of Liuming Valley people coldly said to Moz Qingyun: "Kid, don’t say I didn’t give you a chance. If you kill yourself now, you can save some pain."

Hearing Liuming Valley’s words, Moz Qingyun didn’t pay attention and raised his hand to slash at them.

Furnace Sun Mountain-Splitting Saber

With Moz Qingyun’s attack, true qi surged like roaring waves.

The wave of true qi turned into a five-meter-long true qi blade and slashed towards Liuming Valley people.

Puh puh puh...

Under Moz Qingyun’s attack, some weaker people were sent flying and spewed blood.

Taptap tap...

As for the stronger ones, their expressions changed in shock at Moz Qingyun’s strength.

"How... How is it possible? His cultivation could have reached Seventh Stage True Qi realm..."

Moz Qingyun suddenly showing Seventh Stage True Qi realm cultivation made Liuming Valley people’s expressions change and their hearts shook.

Just a few days ago, Moz Qingyun was only at Fifth Stage True Qi realm. Now he had reached Seventh Stage.

This cultivation speed was a bit shocking, wasn’t it?

Soul Dragon Seal

Ignoring Liuming Valley people’s shock, Moz Qingyun summoned twenty-seven battle seals to form a suit of armor around his body.

Shadow Swift Step

Then Moz Qingyun moved and directly charged into Liuming Valley people, continuously swinging his Fire Silk Saber.

Puh puh puh...

Under Moz Qingyun’s attack, some people were instantly killed and blood spewed out.

At this moment, Moz Qingyun’s body was enveloped in red true qi, emitting a shocking heat wave. His aura was astonishing, like a war god.

As for Liuming Valley people facing Moz Qingyun’s attack, they were as panicked as lambs being attacked by a tiger.

In no time, Liuming Valley people were slaughtered one after another, their eyes wide with unwillingness.

They came to snatch treasures, not to be slaughtered.

"Devil! Run for your life..."

Someone shouted in panic and fled crazily.

Hearing this person’s shout, others responded and started fleeing too.

"Can you escape?"

Seeing the remaining Liuming Valley people trying to flee, Moz Qingyun said with a cold smile and chased after them.

"Kid, don’t be too much. Leave some room for the future."

Facing Moz Qingyun’s imposing aura, one of Liuming Valley people said with a panicked expression.

"Too much?"

Moz Qingyun looked at him disdainfully and said: "When you wanted to snatch our place outside Fentian Sect ruins, when you wanted to snatch my treasure weapon just now, did you ever think about being too much? If you take action, you should be prepared to bear the consequences."

After Moz Qingyun’s words, he held the Fire Silk Saber and slashed at the remaining Liuming Valley people. His actions were decisive, without any hesitation.

Under Moz Qingyun’s continuous attacks, the remaining Liuming Valley people were also killed one after another. No one was spared.

After killing Liuming Valley people, Moz Qingyun collected their乾坤bags and continued towards the deeper parts of Fentian Sect.

Seeing Moz Qingyun’s powerful slaughter of Liuming Valley people, everyone around showed expressions of awe and kept their distance from him.
