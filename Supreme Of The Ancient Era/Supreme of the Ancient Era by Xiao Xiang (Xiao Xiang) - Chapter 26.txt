Mo Hongtian and others instantly turned pale, wanting to intervene but it was too late.

Boom!

Facing He Xiao's attack, Mo Xin had almost no resistance and was struck on the shoulder.

Puh!

Under the terrifying impact, her body was directly sent flying out and she spat out a mouthful of blood.

Seeing Mo Xin's body fly backward, Mo Qingyun moved and caught her to prevent her from falling.

But He Xiao's attack was too strong, Mo Xin fainted in his arms after he caught her.

Looking at the unconscious Mo Xin with blood trickling from the corner of her mouth and pale face in Mo Qingyun's arms, everyone felt a pang of sympathy.

Such a beautiful woman as Mo Xin, He Xiao dealt such a heavy blow to her. This guy is too ruthless.

With his True Qi Realm Third Level cultivation, it was very easy for He Xiao to defeat Mo Xin.

But now he summoned his martial soul and used its abilities, clearly doing it on purpose.

His actions were undoubtedly a retaliation against the Mo family, aiming to cripple or kill Mo Xin in revenge for Mo Qingyun's earlier actions.

"Xin'er!"

Seeing Mo Xin faint, Mo Hongtian and others instantly showed anxious expressions, filled with anger.

Mo Qingyun took out a pill and gave it to Mo Xin before having Mo Xiao help her rest.

After doing this, Mo Qingyun's face turned cold as he looked at He Xiao and said in a cold voice: "From now on, for the He family and those related to them, I will not hold back."

Mo Qingyun's tone was chilling like the soul-snatching sound from the Netherworld, making people shiver.

Everyone could hear that Mo Qingyun was very angry now.

After finishing his words, Mo Qingyun sat back down with a cold expression, waiting for the next battle.

Next up was Song Zihao's match against another person,

Perhaps seeing Mo Xin's miserable state, the other person immediately surrendered upon seeing Song Zihao as his opponent.

The last match was won by a second-level True Qi Realm person from the Song family named Song Shiyun.

Thus, the top five were born: Mo Qingyun, Mo Cang, Song Shiyun, Song Zihao, and He Xiao.

After the top five were born, they rested briefly before proceeding with a ranking match among them.

Moments later, the opponents were drawn again.

Among five people drawing lots, one would naturally be idle.

After Mo Qingyun and others drew their lots, the results were as follows:

Song Zihao was idle, Mo Qingyun would next fight against Mo Cang, and He Xiao would face Song Shiyun.

Mo Qingyun fighting Mo Cang?

Seeing this result, everyone's expressions changed with a hint of anticipation.

Previously, Elder Mo Kuide said that Mo Cang was the true first among the younger generation of the Mo family, while Mo Qingyun was just nominally the first.

Now, this nominal first among the younger generation of the Mo family would fight against the true first.

This match was indeed anticipated.

Who is truly outstanding and who has a hollow reputation seemed about to be revealed soon.

In the arena,

Mo Cang looked at Mo Qingyun with a cold expression and said, "Mo Qingyun, I will let everyone know that I am the true first among the younger generation of the Mo family. I will return to you a hundredfold the humiliation you brought me in this clan competition."

"One move!"

In response to Mo Cang's words, Mo Qingyun said with a cold expression.

"One move?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, Mo Cang was initially stunned before laughing and saying, "It seems you have some self-awareness. Since you said it yourself, I will defeat you in one move."

"Defeat me in one move?"

Mo Qingyun's eyes narrowed slightly, knowing that Mo Cang misunderstood his words. But at this moment, Mo Qingyun also spared no words with Mo Cang.

Chapter 96: Wasting He Xiao

幽冥虎, appear!

Summoning the幽冥虎 martial soul, Mo Cang's aura instantly changed, becoming even more powerful and dark.

幽冥鬼瞳

With the martial soul ability activated, Mo Cang's eyes instantly shone with ghostly light, full of evil.

Then, a dazzling blue light emanated from Mo Cang's eyes and directly attacked Mo Qingyun.

疾影步

Facing Mo Cang's martial soul ability, Mo Qingyun took a light step and easily dodged the attack.

"Roll away!"

Then, Mo Qingyun raised his hand and struck Mo Cang in the chest with a palm, sending him flying.

Puh!

After being hit by Mo Qingyun's palm, Mo Cang spat out a mouthful of blood and his face turned pale as he fell outside the arena.

In one move, Mo Cang was defeated!

Seeing this result, everyone instantly froze with wide eyes.

At that moment, they realized what Mo Qingyun meant by one move.

He was saying he could defeat Mo Cang in just one move.

"First among the younger generation of the Mo family?"

Mo Qingyun glanced at Mo Cang with disdain and said a contemptuous word before walking towards the arena.

After Mo Qingyun's words, everyone looked at Mo Cang with mocking expressions.

Mo Cang was the true first among the younger generation of the Mo family?

But why did he seem so weak in front of Mo Qingyun, who was nominally the first?

At this moment, a strong sense of irony弥漫in the air.

Of course, while mocking Mo Cang, everyone was more shocked by Mo Qingyun's strength.

Under the ridicule of others, Mo Cang's face turned red with a sense of defeat rising in his heart.

The gap between him and Mo Qingyun seemed not only to have narrowed but widened even more.

With a hint of melancholy, Mo Cang slowly approached Mo Kuide.

Seeing Mo Cang defeated by Mo Qingyun in one move, Mo Kuide felt a myriad of emotions, his mood extremely complex.

But if observed carefully, one could see that Mo Kuide's eyes were colder now, with a hint of killing intent.

Yes, it was killing intent. Mo Kuide's gaze towards Mo Qingyun contained a strong sense of killing intent.

However, Mo Kuide concealed it well and others did not notice.

In the arena,

After Mo Qingyun's match with Mo Cang ended, it was Song Shiyun and He Xiao's turn to fight.

Due to the relationship between the Song family and the He family, He Xiao was more restrained when fighting Song Shiyun compared to how he treated Mo Xin.

But the difference in cultivation between Song Shiyun and He Xiao was too great. After a short battle, Song Shiyun admitted defeat.

With Song Shiyun's admission of defeat, the top three were born: Mo Qingyun, Song Zihao, and He Xiao.

"Rest for a moment before the top three battle."

A judge said to Mo Qingyun and others.

"No need, let's start right away,"

At this moment, as the judge finished speaking, He Xiao suddenly said.

Seeing He Xiao speak up, the judge looked at Mo Qingyun and Song Zihao and asked, "What do you think?"

In the judge's view, since He Xiao did not mind after his previous battle, Mo Qingyun and Song Zihao should be even less bothered.

"Start right away?"

Mo Qingyun and Song Zihao nodded in agreement with He Xiao's suggestion.

Then, Mo Qingyun stepped forward and walked to the center of the arena.

Seeing Mo Qingyun step forward first, everyone's expressions changed. Was Mo Qingyun about to start the battle?

"He Xiao, come up!"

Under everyone's shocked gaze, Mo Qingyun looked at He Xiao with a cold expression and said.

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, He Xiao smiled coldly and slowly walked into the arena, saying, "I didn't expect you to come up so eagerly to die. This is good; I will deal with you first, then I can have a proper battle with Brother Zihao."

"Haha, so let Brother He Xiao deal with this troublesome kid first,"

Hearing He Xiao's words, Song Zihao smiled and replied.

"Youngster, I thought you would hide and avoid the battle. Didn't expect you to come up here to die,"

He Xiao glanced at Mo Qingyun coldly and said, "Do you think with your first-level True Qi Realm cultivation, you can be my opponent?"

"Is that so?"

Under He Xiao's words, Mo Qingyun's aura instantly rose.

Soon, Mo Qingyun's cultivation reached the second level of True Qi Realm.

"Second-level True Qi Realm!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun's cultivation, Mo Hongtian and others were shocked.

"His cultivation has reached the second level of True Qi Realm!"

Discovering Mo Qingyun's cultivation, Mo Cang felt a wave of frustration. He didn't expect Mo Qingyun to reach the second level of True Qi Realm.

"Second-level True Qi Realm?"

Feeling Mo Qingyun's aura change, He Xiao's expression changed slightly and then said disdainfully, "Do you think with your second-level True Qi Realm cultivation, you can pose a threat to me?"

In He Xiao's view, whether Mo Qingyun was at the first or second level of True Qi Realm made no difference.

"Waste you enough!"

Mo Qingyun said with a cold expression.

"Hmph! You have quite the big mouth. Now I will let you know how foolish your thoughts are,"

He Xiao said with a cold expression.

疾影步

At this moment, Mo Qingyun also spared no words with He Xiao and directly moved towards him.

九重崩

Mo Qingyun punched out, instantly causing his True Qi to surge and form several True Qi fist shadows towards He Xiao.

Facing Mo Qingyun's attack, He Xiao did not hesitate and immediately retaliated.

破山斧，现！

Then a huge golden axe appeared above He Xiao, exuding terrifying soul power.

斧破山河！斩！

After summoning his martial soul, He Xiao directly used its ability, seemingly wanting to end the battle quickly.

Boom!

The fist shadows and axe shadows collided, emitting muffled sounds as True Qi raged and the atmosphere was intense.

At the same time, He Xiao's martial soul ability was instantly shattered by Mo Qingyun's attack.

He Xiao's martial soul ability was shattered!

Seeing this, everyone turned pale with shock.

火龙印

Meanwhile, Mo Qingyun moved and attacked He Xiao again.

In an instant, twenty-seven True Qi battle seals formed a huge shield and pressed down on He Xiao.

The scene was like Mount Tai pressing down, wanting to suppress and crush everything below.

What a terrifying martial technique!

Seeing Mo Qingyun's move, everyone turned pale again. They didn't expect Mo Qingyun to possess such a terrifying martial technique.

金斧裂石

Facing the twenty-seven battle seals, He Xiao finally turned pale and hurriedly defended.

He Xiao's palm burst with powerful True Qi, forming an axe beam that rapidly struck the flame shield.

But when the axe beam touched the flame shield, it was instantly crushed and dissipated.

Boom!

Crushing the axe beam, the flame shield continued its descent, pressing down on He Xiao.

Puh!

Under the pressure of the flame shield, He Xiao was pressed to the ground and spat out a mouthful of blood.

"Stop! We admit defeat!"

Seeing this, He Qiansheng's face turned panicked and he shouted.

But Mo Qingyun paid no heed to his words, moving again and kicking He Xiao.

Crack...

Four crisp bone-breaking sounds rang out as He Xiao's hands and feet were instantly crippled, lying on the ground like a dead dog.

Boom!

Mo Qingyun kicked again, targeting He Xiao's dantian and sending him flying out of the arena.

He Xiao was crippled!

"Youngster, you..."

Seeing Mo Qingyun's actions, the He family members were instantly enraged, gritting their teeth.

He Xiao was the first genius of the He family. Now he had been crippled by Mo Qingyun; how could they not be angry?

But at this moment, they couldn't say much. After all, He Xiao's actions towards Mo Xin were too excessive.

At this moment, the result of He Xiao was self-inflicted.

Chapter 97: Revealing Sharpness (Second Update)

"This youngster..."

Seeing Mo Qingyun's actions, Mo Hongtian and others smiled helplessly.

This kid really holds grudges!

Moreover, Mo Qingyun's style of doing things was still so decisive.

Revenge doesn't wait until tomorrow, perhaps this is what it means.

"This youngster is so ruthless!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun's sharp methods, Mo Cang's expression involuntarily twitched with a chill rising in his heart.

At this moment, he couldn't help but feel relieved. He was glad that he hadn't provoked Mo Qingyun's anger.

Previously, when Mo Qingyun wanted to cripple Mo Hai, he didn't feel much. After all, at that time, Mo Qingyun hadn't posed a great threat to him.

At this moment, he truly felt afraid. Because now Mo Qingyun's strength had far surpassed his.

"I underestimated this youngster,"

Mo Kuide's expression turned uncertain, as if he had made up his mind: "With such sharpness and talent, I can't let him grow unchecked."

While the Mo family members were shocked, others around them were also deeply surprised.

They never expected that Mo Qingyun would publicly cripple He Xiao.

At this moment, as everyone was shocked by Mo Qingyun's performance,

"Master, your old servant has come out."

A respectful voice suddenly appeared in Mo Qingyun's mind. This was Chu Lian transmitting a message to him.

"Chu Lian!"

Hearing this voice, Mo Qingyun's expression changed with a hint of joy.

Soon, he saw Chu Lian in the crowd wearing a cloak.

Seeing Chu Lian appear, Mo Qingyun's lips curled into a cold smile as he looked at Song Zihao with a chilling gaze.

Since Chu Lian had arrived, he no longer needed to hold back. Today was the time to eliminate Song Zihao.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun's gaze towards Song Zihao was like a tiger hunting its prey, full of majesty.

"Song Zihao, let's settle this."

Mo Qingyun said indifferently as he looked at Song Zihao.

Settle this?

When Mo Qingyun said these words, everyone's expressions changed with some confusion about his meaning.

But after a brief moment of daze, they understood.

Because of He Lingyu. Originally, she was Mo Qingyun's fiancée but now she is with Song Zihao.

Mo Qingyun saying this to Song Zihao made sense.

Then, everyone showed curious expressions, wondering who would prevail in this battle between Mo Qingyun and Song Zihao.

"Settle?"

Song Zihao smiled disdainfully as he walked into the arena, "Mo Qingyun, although your performance surprised me, you are not my match."

"They all said the same thing about those who fought with me before,"

Mo Qingyun replied indifferently, "A few months ago, what you did to me, I will reclaim today."

"You'll never have that chance,"

Song Zihao smiled disdainfully again, "Mo Qingyun, you are destined to be trampled by me. Accept your fate; let me show you how great the gap is between us."

After Song Zihao's words, he exuded a terrifying True Qi aura.

Fourth-level True Qi Realm!

Song Zihao's true cultivation had reached the fourth level of True Qi Realm.

The difference between third and fourth-level True Qi Realm was significant, a qualitative leap from the initial to intermediate stage.

"Mm, Zihao is good; his cultivation has broken through to the fourth level of True Qi Realm,"

Seeing Song Zihao's performance, Song Xu smiled with satisfaction.

"Zihao, can you win?"

Looking at the two confronting Mo Qingyun and Song Zihao, He Lingyu's expression was complex with a hint of confusion.

She never expected the person she once looked down upon as a waste would grow to such an extent.

"Fourth-level True Qi Realm!"

Seeing Song Zihao's current performance, Mo Hongtian and others' expressions changed with a hint of worry.

Song Zihao at the fourth level of True Qi Realm was not comparable to He Xiao. It would be extremely difficult for Mo Qingyun to defeat him.

In the arena,

Under everyone's shocked gaze, Song Zihao looked smug as he summoned his martial soul.

Sss...

The tenth-level Red Thunder Toad martial soul was instantly exuding intense lightning power when summoned by Song Zihao.

"Mo Qingyun, summon your martial soul,"

Song Zihao looked at Mo Qingyun with a mocking expression and then said in feigned surprise, "I almost forgot; your martial soul is only a first-level Lighting Soul. Summoning it seems useless."

"Is that so?"

But Mo Qingyun paid no heed to his words, smiling playfully and saying, "Since you all want to know my martial soul, I will let you see it today."

Roar!

Then a dragon's roar echoed as a twenty-meter-long red dragon shadow appeared above Mo Qingyun.

This...

Seeing this, everyone was stunned.

Is this Mo Qingyun's martial soul?

Is this the so-called first-level trash martial soul that Mo Qingyun possesses?

At this moment, everyone's hearts were filled with confusion and bewilderment.

After a brief daze, everyone was shocked, almost unable to believe their eyes.

Heavenly Dragon, Heavenly Dragon martial soul!

Mo Qingyun's martial soul was actually a Heavenly Dragon martial soul!

The weakest of the Heavenly Dragons is still beyond tenth-level, reaching the level of a Super martial soul.

In other words, Mo Qingyun's martial soul is at the Super level!

Super martial souls, perhaps there have never been any in the history of Beimozhen Town.

Who would have thought that Mo Qingyun's martial soul was such an existence.

"He actually has a Heavenly Dragon martial soul,"

A bitter taste rose in Mo Cang's heart.

At this moment, he felt like a fool. With his tenth-level martial soul, he had boasted in front of Mo Qingyun who possessed a Super martial soul.

"Not... possible. His martial soul can't be Heavenly Dragon!"

Seeing the red dragon shadow above Mo Qingyun's body, He Lingyu was almost mad with disbelief.

She had given up a genius with a Super martial soul for someone with a tenth-level martial soul.

"The Mo family's youngster is hiding deep,"

At this moment, the patriarchs of various families were complex in their hearts and couldn't help but sigh.

At this moment, a red-haired old man wearing a cloak among the crowd of various families showed an expression of surprise and said, "I didn't expect Master's martial soul to be the top-tier thirteenth-level Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul. Master is truly extraordinary."

Plop!

After a brief daze, Mo Hongtian was so excited that he dropped the teacup in his hand onto the ground with a crisp sound.

"Heavenly Dragon martial soul!"

Mo Hongtian trembled all over with excitement, his old eyes filled with tears as he laughed excitedly, "Heaven has opened its eyes; heaven blesses our Mo family..."

"It's like this, it's like this..."

Mo Feipeng was excited with clenched fists as if he understood something and laughed, "This youngster has a Super martial soul; no wonder his cultivation speed is so fast..."

"He finally revealed his true talent,"

Mo Xiao and Mo Ling both showed bright smiles, sweetly smiling.

At this moment, the low-key young man in their eyes finally revealed his true talent without reservation.

He wanted everyone to know that he was the real genius.

In Beimozhen Town, those family geniuses were not worth mentioning in front of him.

At this moment, everyone was complex in their hearts, marveling at the scene.

They never expected that the so-called waste of Beimozhen Town would be its most outstanding genius.

After ten years of hiding his sword, this young man finally drew it out to reveal his sharpness.

Chapter 98: Dominantly Slashing Song Zihao

"Did you all know that Qingyun has a Super martial soul?"

Hearing Mo Xiao and Mo Xin's words, Mo Yueyu's expression changed as she asked in surprise.

"Mm!"

The two girls smiled sweetly and nodded.

Mo Ling added, "Last time in Lianyun City, when my body's power erupted, Qingyun used his martial soul to absorb the fire energy in my body and relieved it for me."

"He... helped you relieve the fire energy in your body?"

Hearing Mo Ling's words, Mo Yueyu's expression changed dramatically with shock. Her chest heaved up and down for a long time, unable to calm down.

Mo Ling's condition she was very clear about. For many years, she had sought out famous doctors for Mo Ling but to no avail.

Every time Mo Ling's body erupted, she had to use a lot of effort and energy to barely suppress the fire energy in her body.

But she was at the sixth level of True Essence Realm, while Mo Qingyun was just at the initial stage of True Qi Realm. It couldn't be compared.

...

In the arena,

"Super martial soul, I didn't expect you to have such talent,"

Song Zihao looked at Mo Qingyun with a shocked expression and said, "But even so, the difference in our realms is too great. You are still not my match."

Heavenly Toad Thunder Light

Song Zihao crouched on the ground like a big toad, lightning flashing from his body and True Qi surging.

Then he opened his mouth and spat out a huge ball of lightning, rapidly heading towards Mo Qingyun.

Fire Dragon Seal

Facing Song Zihao's attack, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and formed twenty-seven True Qi seals with his hands.

The twenty-seven True Qi seals instantly formed a shield and blocked the huge ball of lightning.

Sss...

When the ball of lightning touched the fire shield, sparks flew and crackling sounds echoed.

Shadow Step

Mo Qingyun moved his body, leaving a trail of afterimages and instantly appeared in front of Song Zihao.

Ninefold Collapse

Mo Qingyun punched out, a series of True Qi fist shadows carrying an overwhelming momentum heading towards Song Zihao.

Facing Mo Qingyun's attack, Song Zihao did not dare to be careless and hurriedly defended.

Thunder Toad Wave Palm

Song Zihao rapidly punched out with both hands, like waves in the sea, one wave after another hitting the fist shadows.

Boom boom boom...

For a moment, fists and palms collided, True Qi resonating with continuous sounds as the sky changed color.

Heavenly Toad Thunder Voice!

Blocking Mo Qingyun's attack, Song Zihao did not hold back and immediately used his martial soul ability.

A huge image of a thunder toad instantly enveloped him, exuding the solemn aura of a Buddha.

At the same time, an awe-inspiring chant sounded from the thunder toad's mouth, forming a strange symbol and pressing towards Mo Qingyun's head.

"Soul-damaging sound wave martial soul ability!"

Seeing Song Zihao use his martial soul ability, Mo Qingyun's expression changed with a hint of surprise.

Soul Heaven Seal

Facing the rapidly approaching sound wave symbol, Mo Qingyun immediately used Soul Heaven Seal to protect his soul from damage.

Swallow it for me!

After doing this, Mo Qingyun pointed and controlled the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul to directly swallow the Red Thunder Toad.

Roar!

With a roar, the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul twisted its body and dove down to swallow the Red Thunder Toad.

In an instant, the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul arrived in front of the Red Thunder Toad and opened its mouth to swallow it.

Puh!

With his martial soul swallowed, Song Zihao's mind was injured and he spat out a mouthful of blood with a pale face, showing fear.

His martial soul was swallowed by Mo Qingyun's Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul.

At this moment, the others around the arena were also shocked and amazed.

"How... possible? Mo Qingyun's martial soul actually swallowed Song Zihao's martial soul."

"What kind of technique is this, can martial souls be used like this?"

"This youngster is so mysterious; we underestimated him. The outcome of this battle has already been decided."

...

For a moment, there was chaos around.

"This youngster..."

At this moment, except for Mo Xiao, everyone else's expressions were blank, completely stunned.

The strength Mo Qingyun displayed now was beyond their expectations.

This technique they had never heard of or seen before.

Blood Qi Rampage!

Ignoring everyone's shock, Mo Qingyun also used his martial soul ability.

With the martial soul ability activated, Mo Qingyun's aura instantly surged to a level comparable to fifth-level True Qi Realm.

Fifth-level True Qi Realm!

Feeling the change in his aura, everyone was shocked again with their expressions twitching.

Mo Qingyun still had such a technique hidden. He is only sixteen or seventeen years old, isn't he?

"Such terrifying talent; such people are destined to be extraordinary. Once they rise, it will be like a storm."

"This Town Meeting's true protagonist is him; everyone else is just his foil, stepping stones for him."

"The Mo family's good fortune to have such a prodigy among the younger generation."

...

At this moment, everyone was marveling.

Ninefold Collapse

After using his martial soul ability, Mo Qingyun directly punched Song Zihao. True Qi raged and fist shadows flew.

"Admit defeat, we admit defeat in this battle."

Seeing Mo Qingyun display fifth-level True Qi Realm cultivation, the Song family members could no longer remain calm and shouted loudly.

But Mo Qingyun paid no heed to their words, punching down without hesitation.

With his martial soul swallowed and mind injured, Song Zihao barely had time to defend before being hit.

Boom!

Under the violent True Qi impact, Song Zihao was sent flying and spat out a mouthful of blood with a listless expression.

Shadow Step

At this moment, Mo Qingyun moved again and followed Song Zihao, grabbing him.

"Youngster, you're looking for death!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun's actions, a second-level True Essence Realm elder from the Song family could no longer remain calm and punched towards Mo Qingyun.

With his punch, a thick True Essence hand formed like a grabbing hand and headed towards Mo Qingyun.

Soul Heaven Seal

Facing this person's attack, Mo Qingyun's expression turned cold and he immediately summoned nine Soul Heaven Seals towards the person's head.

Puh!

The Soul Heaven Seal instantly struck the person's head, heavily injuring his soul.

"Ah!"

With his soul injured, the person groaned in pain with blood trickling from the corner of his mouth.

At the same time, the True Essence hand he punched out weakened and slowly dissipated in mid-air.

After defeating this Song family member, Mo Qingyun's speed did not decrease as he grabbed Song Zihao's throat.

Crack!

With Mo Qingyun's force, a crisp bone-breaking sound rang out as Song Zihao's throat was crushed by Mo Qingyun.

Song family's first genius, Song Zihao died!

After killing Song Zihao, Mo Qingyun threw him to the ground as if he were trash.

So ruthless!

Seeing this, everyone's hearts jolted with a hint of fear in their eyes.

But what shocked them even more was that Mo Qingyun killed Song Zihao under the hands of a second-level True Essence Realm powerhouse.

And with one strike, he heavily injured that second-level True Essence Realm powerhouse!

This ability and technique completely shattered everyone's perception, making them hard to believe.

A True Qi Realm person heavily injuring a True Essence Realm person; such things seemed never happened before.

At this moment, the strength this young man displayed had completely surpassed everyone's perception.

"Youngster, you're too much!"

Seeing Song Zihao killed, the Song family members were enraged and rushed towards Mo Qingyun: "Youngster, I will kill you."

"Protect Qingyun!"

Seeing the Song family members' actions, Mo Hongtian and others no longer hesitated and rushed towards Mo Qingyun.

Chapter 99: Adding Insult to Injury

When the two groups of family members joined, they immediately started a fierce battle.

Mo Hongtian fought Song Xu while others found opponents of similar cultivation and engaged in combat.

Everyone was caught off guard by this scene, coming too suddenly.

At the same time, some weaker families quickly retreated to avoid getting involved.

This scale of battle was not something they could participate in; it was better for them to stay away.

With these families retreating, the battlefield became much more spacious.

Now in the arena, only two groups remained.

One was from the He family and the other was Mo Kuide's faction of the Mo family.

Seeing Mo Kuide and others watching from the side without joining forces with Mo Hongtian's group to fight against the Song family,

the surrounding people showed complex expressions, seemingly sensing something and unconsciously worrying for Mo Hongtian's group.

The overall strength of the Mo family was already slightly weaker than that of the Song family. Now with Mo Kuide's group choosing to watch from the side,

the gap between Mo Hongtian's group and the Song family widened even more.

Soon, Mo Hongtian's group was at a disadvantage with some getting injured.

"Grand Elder, what are you doing? Hurry and help us,"

Seeing Mo Kuide's group watching from the side without joining in, Mo Hongtian angrily said.

"Help?"

Mo Kuide smiled disdainfully and said, "Family Head, Mo Qingyun disrespects clan rules, looks down on elders, is unruly and violent. Now he has killed a talented young member of the Song family, showing his cruel nature. In my view, it's better to let him be dealt with by the Song family."

"Mo Hongtian, in my view, Elder Kuide is more reasonable."
