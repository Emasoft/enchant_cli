After selecting the individuals to control the array, Mo Qingyun began guiding them on how to master the Seven Star Killing Array.

Five days later.

Under Mo Qingyun's meticulous guidance, everyone finally fully grasped how to control the Seven Star Killing Array.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun wore a satisfied expression and had everyone continue to practice the array while he went into seclusion for cultivation.

In these few days, Mo Qingyun discovered signs of breakthrough in his soul cultivation while guiding everyone to familiarize themselves with the array.

Upon this discovery, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and immediately began to break through his soul cultivation.

If his soul cultivation advanced further, his strength would greatly increase in a short period of time.

In the courtyard, Mo Qingyun focused his mind and immersed himself entirely in cultivation.

Under continuous cultivation by Mo Qingyun, his soul gradually transformed from its mist-like state to a liquid one.

Upon this discovery, Mo Qingyun no longer hesitated and worked even harder to transform his soul into a liquid state.

A day later, Mo Qingyun opened his eyes with an expression of surprise and joy.

His soul cultivation had finally broken through to the Spirit Origin realm.

After a brief moment of surprise, Mo Qingyun calmed his emotions and continued to cultivate, stabilizing his current soul realm.

About half a day later, Mo Qingyun stopped cultivating. At this point, his soul realm was finally stabilized.

Seeing that his soul cultivation had been stabilized, Mo Qingyun pondered and thought to himself, "With my soul cultivation stabilized, I should practice the Soul Heaven Seal."

Upon this thought, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and began to refine the soul battle seal.

Under Mo Qingyun's refinement, the soul battle seal started to transform from its gaseous state into a liquid one.

With this transformation, the soul battle seal became more stable and its power increased significantly.

Three days later, Mo Qingyun stopped his cultivation.

After three days of refinement, all eighteen soul battle seals were completely transformed. Moreover, Mo Qingyun re-refined nine more soul battle seals.

Thus, the number of soul battle seals refined by Mo Qingyun reached twenty-seven in total.

"Doesn't know if the Du family has arrived?"

Thinking of this, Mo Qingyun stopped his cultivation and walked out of the courtyard.

Bang!

At that moment, as soon as Mo Qingyun stepped outside the courtyard, a terrifying aura of essence energy erupted within Jade Crystal Manor.

A half-step Pill Mansion realm aura!

"Chu Lian's cultivation has broken through."

Upon this discovery, Mo Qingyun's expression changed with surprise and then joy.

Immediately after, Mo Qingyun moved his body swiftly towards Chu Lian's residence.

Moments later, Mo Qingyun arrived at Chu Lian's place.

At this time, Wan Liyun and others had already arrived first.

"Chu Sir's cultivation speed is truly shocking. His cultivation might surpass mine soon."

Seeing Chu Lian reach the half-step Pill Mansion realm, Wan Liyun couldn't help but exclaim.

He saw Chu Lian's cultivation level rise from the first stage of Essence Core realm to a half-step Pill Mansion realm in just a few months. This cultivation speed was terrifying.

Hearing Wan Liyun's words, Du Luo and others changed their expressions and looked at Mo Qingyun, asking, "Qingyun, what is Chu Sir's identity?"

Hearing Du Luo and others' questions, Mo Qingyun was silent for a moment before saying solemnly, "Regarding Chu Lian's identity, you'd better not ask. It won't be good for you."

Mo Qingyun was right; Chu Lian's enemy was the Supreme powerhouse Li He. If his identity were exposed, it could cause unnecessary trouble.

"Huh?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, Wan Liyun and others were surprised by his answer.

Subsequently, they did not ask further. They knew Mo Qingyun had a reason for saying so.

Moreover, they were not the type to pry into details.

Seeing that everyone did not ask further, Mo Qingyun pondered and asked, "Three teachers, Wan City Lord, have the Du family people arrived?"

"Not yet!"

Hearing this, Wan Liyun's expression immediately turned solemn and said, "But I heard that the news of Yuan Sheng being killed has reached the Du family. It's likely they will arrive soon."

"Hmm!"

Hearing Wan Liyun's words, Mo Qingyun's expression became more serious and said, "Whether they come early or late, we have to face them. Now that Chu Lian's cultivation has broken through to the half-step Pill Mansion realm, if they dare come and break the array, I will make them return in defeat."

Thus, half an hour after Mo Qingyun and others arrived, Chu Lian stopped his cultivation.

"Master, Wan City Lord, Du President... you're all here!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun and others present, Chu Lian smiled faintly and greeted them.

Seeing Chu Lian approach, Wan Liyun chuckled awkwardly and joked to Chu Lian, "Chu Sir, I'm probably not your match now."

Wan Liyun's words were true. Facing Chu Lian who had comprehended the power of might, even if he entered the half-step Pill Mansion realm earlier, he was still not Chu Lian's match.

This was an understanding of a realm that could not be made up for by just a little difference in cultivation.

After Wan Liyun's words, Du Luo smiled faintly and said, "Haha, we're all family. The stronger Chu Sir is, the better it is for us."

"Indeed!"

Hearing Du Luo's words, Mo Qingyun and others nodded in agreement.

Subsequently, Mo Qingyun and others conversed while heading towards the Jade Crystal Manor's assembly hall.

...

...

Whoosh!

As Mo Qingyun and others talked, two breaking-the-air sounds echoed in the sky above Northern Desert Town.

Following these sounds, two figures stopped in midair over Northern Desert Town, emanating powerful auras.

Standing in the air!

These were Pill Mansion realm powerhouses!

Seeing the two figures standing midair, the people of Northern Desert Town were all shocked.

For a town without even an Essence Core powerhouse, two Pill Mansion realm powerhouses arriving at once was quite unusual.

At this moment, as everyone was shocked,

The man among the two figures in midair asked below solemnly, "Is there a Mo family here?"

"Mo family!"

"They're looking for the Mo family!"

"The Mo family can recognize Pill Mansion realm powerhouses, no wonder they could eliminate the Song and He families."

...

Hearing the man's question, those below were all shocked and exclaimed in surprise.

At this moment, they seemed to understand something, knowing the root cause of why the Mo family could eliminate the Song and He families.

"Pre... predecessor, the people from the Mo family have already gone to Linked Cloud City."

One of the men below responded fearfully under the gaze from above.

"Linked Cloud City!"

Hearing this man's answer, the man in midair frowned and said to his female companion, "Sister, let's go."

Then, the two moved their bodies and flew towards Linked Cloud City.

...

Whoosh, whoosh!

Moments later, two figures sped over the sky of Linked Cloud City, emanating terrifying auras.

"Where is the Mo family?" These two figures asked someone in the city below when they arrived above Linked Cloud City.

Under their auras, the person being asked was immediately terrified and stuttered in response, "Re... predecessor, there is no Mo family in Linked Cloud City!"

Hearing this person's answer, the woman among the two figures above frowned and said, "Humph, you're asking for death!"

Then, this woman snorted coldly and raised her hand to strike the person below.

Bang!

Under this woman's palm, the person being asked was instantly blasted into dust and vanished in the天地间。

Seeing his companion's actions, the man showed a look of reluctance and slightly reproached her, "Luoyuan Sister, we're just looking for someone this time. Don't cause unnecessary slaughter."

"Only a mere insect, what's the harm in killing it?"

Hearing his companion's words, Luoyuan showed a haughty expression and said indifferently, "Besides, I think he was deliberately hiding something to waste our time. Why be soft on such a person?"

"You..."

Hearing Luoyuan's argument, the man snorted coldly and left with a flick of his sleeve.

"Sister, Thousand Yi Brother, don't be angry."

Seeing the man's displeasure, Luoyuan showed a pout and said to him, "Thousand Yi Brother, I know I was wrong. Can you listen to me from now on?"

Hearing Luoyuan's words, Thousand Yi's expression improved somewhat and asked another person, "May I ask if there is a Mo family in Linked Cloud City?"

"A Mo family?"

The person being asked showed a thoughtful expression and replied after some thought, "Re... predecessor, in Linked Cloud City, I only know that the Pill Prince of Jade Crystal Manor surnames Mo."

"Jade Crystal Manor?"

Thousand Yi frowned slightly and asked again, "How do we get to Jade Crystal Manor?"

The person replied, "Jade Crystal Manor is easy to find. Just go straight down this street and turn right."

Hearing the person's answer, Thousand Yi nodded in response and followed his directions towards Jade Crystal Manor.

Soon after, the two arrived at Jade Crystal Manor's entrance.

"There is an array!"

Seeing the Seven Star Killing Array outside Jade Crystal Manor, Thousand Yi showed a surprised expression.

He did not expect to find someone who knew arrays in this remote place.

"Is it not here?"

After a brief surprise, Thousand Yi showed a puzzled expression and pondered.

In his impression, the Mo family should be very weak and definitely could not know how to set up arrays or have the ability to hire array masters.

"Humph!"

As Thousand Yi pondered, Luoyuan disdainfully pursed her lips and said coldly, "Just a countryside place. I'll see what kind of array they can set up."

Luoyuan finished speaking and summoned a azure longsword, striking the Seven Star Killing Array powerfully.

When Luoyuan slashed out with her sword, a dazzling azure light burst from the blade, forming an azure rainbow that struck the Seven Star Killing Array powerfully.

Bang!

Instantly, a loud sound echoed as the colorful light curtain of the Seven Star Killing Array was shaken violently, seeming to be about to shatter.

At the same time, a terrifying backlash force erupted from the Seven Star Killing Array and spread around.

Boom boom boom...

Under this backlash force, surrounding buildings were instantly crushed into ruins.

"Cough!"

As for Luoyuan, she was also shaken back by the backlash force and coughed with a slightly red face.

It seemed that she was not feeling well under this backlash force.

"Damn insects, once I break through this array, I'll wash you all away."

Seeing that she was at a disadvantage against the Seven Star Killing Array, Luoyuan showed a dark expression and struck the array again.

"Little Sister, stop!"

Seeing the woman's actions, Thousand Yi's expression darkened and said unhappily, "Princess Ling, she might be inside Jade Crystal Manor. If you injure her because of your actions, we won't be able to explain it back."

"Humph!"

Hearing Thousand Yi's words, Luoyuan showed a resentful expression and said coldly, "They'd better pray that Princess Ling is inside. Otherwise, don't blame me for being ruthless."

Inside Jade Crystal Manor,

"Someone is breaking the array. Could it be that the Du family has arrived?"

Feeling the fluctuations from the Seven Star Killing Array, Mo Qingyun's expression darkened and became more solemn.

From the fluctuations of the Seven Star Killing Array, he could tell that the strength of the person breaking it was extremely powerful, almost at a high stage of Pill Mansion realm.

Upon this discovery, Mo Qingyun released his soul power and sensed the outside world.

At this moment, Chu Lian beside him also showed a tense expression and said solemnly, "The people outside are very strong. At least they're at the middle stage of Pill Mansion realm."

"Hmm!"

After sensing outside, Mo Qingyun's expression darkened and said solemnly, "The two people outside are extremely powerful. One is at the sixth stage of Pill Mansion realm and the other is at the eighth stage."

Pill Mansion sixth stage, Pill Mansion eighth stage!

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, everyone turned pale as if they were in an ice cellar.

One of the two was at the eighth stage of Pill Mansion realm. With such strength, could the Seven Star Killing Array stop them?

If they lost the Seven Star Killing Array, everyone inside Jade Crystal Manor would be at their mercy.

"Phew! Let's go out and see first!"

Mo Qingyun took a deep breath, said this, and walked towards the assembly hall.

As Mo Qingyun left the assembly hall, he formed a hand seal and struck it towards the sky.

Then, the Seven Star Killing Array was opened, and its colorful light curtain dissipated.

In Mo Qingyun's view, since the Seven Star Killing Array could not stop them, it was better to open it.

Seeing Mo Qingyun's actions, everyone remained silent. They could understand why he did this.

"Humph! You're smart to open the array!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun open the array, Luoyuan snorted coldly and walked into Jade Crystal Manor with a cold expression.

At the same time, Thousand Yi also entered Jade Crystal Manor.

"Xuan Yue Palace people!"

When these two entered Jade Crystal Manor and appeared before everyone, Mo Qingyun and Chu Lian's expressions changed.

They did not expect these two to be from Xuan Yue Palace rather than the Du family.

After a brief surprise, Mo Qingyun looked at them calmly and asked, "Are you from Xuan Yue Palace?"

"You actually know Xuan Yue Palace?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, Thousand Yi and Luoyuan both changed their expressions in surprise.

"Then it should be right. It must be here."

After a brief surprise, the man showed a faint smile and looked at Mo Qingyun with interest, saying, "Little fellow, you must have heard about Xuan Yue Palace from Yue Ru."

"Yue Ru?"

Hearing Thousand Yi's words, everyone changed their expressions in surprise.

However, they soon understood the purpose of these two coming here was because of Mo Yue Ru.

They were looking for Mo Yue Ru!

A high-stage Pill Mansion powerhouse came all the way from afar to find Mo Yue Ru. Everyone felt a sense of curiosity.

Knowing that these two were not from the Du family, Mo Qingyun and others felt relieved. This was also good news.

If the Du family had a high-stage Pill Mansion powerhouse, it would be troublesome.

Mo Qingyun looked at Thousand Yi with a calm expression and asked, "Who are you? What do you want from my aunt?"

"I am Yu Qianyi. I'm an old friend of Yue Ru's and have something important to see her."

Thousand Yi showed a humble expression, looked at Mo Qingyun and others with a smile, and said, "I hope you can let me see Yue Ru."

"Qianyi, is that you?"

At this moment, as Thousand Yi's words fell, an excited voice came from behind Mo Qingyun and others.

Hearing this voice, everyone knew that it was Mo Yue Ru coming.

From this, it seemed that the man was indeed looking for Mo Yue Ru. There would be no mistake.

"Me!"

Seeing Mo Yue Ru appear, Yu Qianyi's expression showed some excitement and said apologetically, "Yue Ru, I've made you suffer these years."

"No! As long as you're here, I'm not suffering at all!"

Mo Yue Ru's expression showed excitement. She walked towards Yu Qianyi with quick steps and looked at him affectionately.

Looking at the Mo Yue Ru in front of him, Yu Qianyi's expression showed a complex mix of admiration, self-reproach, apology, and helplessness...

"Humph!"

Seeing Yu Qianyi's actions with Mo Yue Ru, Luoyuan showed a look of jealousy and snorted coldly. She said disdainfully, "So you're the woman who has made Thousand Yi Brother miss for so many years. She doesn't seem that great, just a poor appearance."

Hearing Luoyuan's words, everyone changed their expressions and looked at her angrily.

Seeing everyone looking at her with anger, Luoyuan's expression darkened and said coldly, "A bunch of insects looking at me like that. You're asking for death!"

Luoyuan finished speaking and raised her hand to strike Mo Feipeng and others.

Instantly, a terrifying aura of essence energy erupted from Luoyuan's palm and enveloped Mo Feipeng and others.

Seeing Luoyuan's actions, Chu Lian's expression changed. He shouted, "Everyone be careful!"

Seven Fiend Bloodstained Dragon, appear!

Soul Transformation!

Bloodthirsty Demon Palm

While warning everyone, Chu Lian moved his body and stood in front of them. With his huge figure, he protected everyone behind him.

"Twelve-stage top-grade martial soul, Seven Fiend Bloodstained Dragon. Second-level blood power!"

Seeing Chu Lian's martial soul and feeling his power, Luoyuan's expression changed. She looked at Chu Lian in surprise.

Then, she showed a look of disdain and said, "At the half-step Pill Mansion realm with a twelve-stage top-grade martial soul and second-level power, you still want to block my palm? You're looking for death."

Puh!

Under Luoyuan's attack, Chu Lian was directly blasted away and transformed back into human form. He spat blood continuously.

"Mr. Chu, are you okay?"

Seeing Chu Lian's condition, Du Luo and others showed a look of concern. They helped him up and sent him back to his residence for rest.

Soul Heaven Seal

Seeing Luoyuan attacking the Mo family, Mo Qingyun's expression darkened. He unhesitatingly summoned his soul battle seals.

Twenty-seven soul battle seals, under Mo Qingyun's control, rushed towards Luoyuan like meteors.

Soon after, the twenty-seven soul battle seals entered Luoyuan's mind.

"Explode!"

After the soul battle seals entered Luoyuan's mind, Mo Qingyun gritted his teeth and exploded all twenty-seven soul battle seals.

Puh puh puh...

Under the continuous explosions of the soul battle seals, terrifying soul shockwaves continuously battered Luoyuan's mind.

Puchi!

Under continuous attacks to her mind, Luoyuan spat blood and turned pale. Her expression showed some listlessness.

Seal Door, Unseal!

Under Luoyuan's dazed state from the attacks to her mind, Mo Qingyun unhesitatingly released the seal on his Pill Mansion realm and relied on its power.

Then, Mo Qingyun's cultivation instantly reached the half-step Pill Mansion realm.

At the same time, a trace of blood seeped out from his skin surface.

This indicated that his body had reached its limit in terms of power it could withstand.

"Such powerful soul power. Moreover, there's a strong force sealed in his body."

Seeing Mo Qingyun's performance, Thousand Yi beside him changed his expression and showed a look of surprise.

Furnace Sun Mountain-Splitting Saber

Relying on the power of his Pill Mansion realm, Mo Qingyun directly took out Fire Silk Saber and slashed towards the dazed Luoyuan.

Instantly, a twenty-meter-long flame saber rushed towards Luoyuan's head.

"Hold on! Please be gentle!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun slashing at Luoyuan, Thousand Yi immediately spoke to stop him. At the same time, he raised his hand and blocked Mo Qingyun's saber light.

Shi!

Under Thousand Yi's actions, Mo Qingyun's attack was easily resolved.

Seeing his powerful strike being easily resolved by Thousand Yi, Mo Qingyun's expression turned cold. He asked Thousand Yi sternly, "You're protecting her?"

Under Mo Qingyun's cold gaze, Thousand Yi felt a chill down his back. He looked at Mo Qingyun and others with a changed expression and said, "Everyone, I don't want to make enemies with you. Let me speak first."

Seeing Thousand Yi's attitude, everyone's expressions eased somewhat. With his eighth-stage Pill Mansion realm strength speaking like this, it was quite sincere.

However, as soon as Thousand Yi's words fell, Luoyuan beside him showed a resentful expression and gritted her teeth. She said, "You insects dared to hurt me? I'll kill you all."

Luoyuan could not accept that she, a high-stage Pill Mansion powerhouse and daughter of an Xuan Yue Palace elder, was hurt by a bunch of insects.

This was a great humiliation for her.

At this moment, as Luoyuan's words fell, she raised her hand to strike Mo Qingyun and others again.

"Little Sister, don't!"

Seeing Luoyuan's actions, Thousand Yi changed his expression and raised his hand to strike out. He blocked Luoyuan's attack.

Under Thousand Yi's actions, Luoyuan's strike was also easily blocked. At the same time, she was shaken back continuously.

Seeing her attack being blocked by Thousand Yi, Luoyuan showed a look of grievance, anger, and jealousy. She looked at Thousand Yi and said, "Thousand Yi Brother, I'm injured, but you didn't help me. You even attacked me?"

Thousand Yi avoided Luoyuan's gaze and showed a look of apology. However, his tone remained firm as he said, "Little Sister Luoyuan, they are Princess Ling's family. You can't hurt them."

"Family? These country bumpkins, do they deserve to be called family?"

Hearing Thousand Yi's words, Luoyuan looked at Mo Qingyun and others with disdain. She looked at Mo Yue Ru with jealousy and said, "You're clearly favoring them because of this woman. You've been bewitched by her."

"Little Sister Luoyuan, don't be unreasonable," Thousand Yi said with a look of reluctance.

"Unreasonable?"

Hearing Thousand Yi's words, Luoyuan's expression became crazier. She said, "Thousand Yi Brother, I've been with you since we were ten years old. We've trained together for forty years. Don't you know my feelings towards you?"

Luoyuan continued, "But with this woman, you've been infatuated for just three months. She's clearly a fox spirit who bewitched your soul. I'll kill her."

With that, Luoyuan raised her hand again and struck towards Mo Yue Ru.

"Little Sister, don't!"

Seeing Luoyuan's actions, Thousand Yi changed his expression and raised his hand to block.

Perhaps because of concern, this time Thousand Yi's strike was a bit heavy. His palm erupted with terrifying essence energy and power.

Puh!

Under Thousand Yi's strike, Luoyuan was blasted away continuously. She spat blood and turned pale.

Seeing that he had accidentally injured Luoyuan, Thousand Yi felt some guilt. He asked her with concern, "Little Sister Luoyuan, are you okay?"

"Thousand Yi, you hurt me. I hate you!"

Luoyuan looked at Thousand Yi with a pained expression and flew away, leaving a resentful word behind: "Mo family, I won't let you off."

"Little Sister Luoyuan!"

Seeing Luoyuan leave, Thousand Yi called out to her. Then he shook his head and walked back without pursuing.

"Thousand Yi, this Luoyuan seems to have feelings for you," Mo Yue Ru said gently.

Seeing the scene just now, everyone could tell that Luoyuan's actions were due to love turning into hate.

"Ai!" Thousand Yi sighed and said, "In my heart, I've always regarded her as a younger sister."

Hearing Thousand Yi's words, everyone fell silent and sighed.

Love was the most unpredictable thing. Just because you put in effort didn't mean you would get a return.

Often, it was like fallen flowers and flowing water. Sometimes, when you tried to plant a flower, it wouldn't bloom, but an osmanthus planted without care would flourish.

In fact, Luoyuan was just a pitiful person.

After sighing, Thousand Yi bowed to everyone and said apologetically, "Everyone, Little Sister Luoyuan is a bit capricious. Please forgive the trouble she caused."

"Mr. Yu, you're being polite," Mo Hongtian and others said with a smile.

Hearing Thousand Yi's apology, everyone responded with smiles. They knew that Thousand Yi and Mo Yue Ru had feelings for each other, but their background was too great.

Thus, Mo Hongtian and others felt a bit reserved, not daring to act like elders.

Thinking that everyone was Mo Yue Ru's relatives and some were even her seniors, Thousand Yi showed a humble expression and said, "Everyone is Yue Ru's elders, brothers, and relatives. Just call me Qianyi."

"Then we're being old," Mo Hongtian said with a smile and followed Thousand Yi's words, saying, "Qianyi, you're our guest. Don't stand here. Come in."

"Alright," Thousand Yi nodded and followed Mo Hongtian to the assembly hall.

Open!

As everyone headed towards the assembly hall, Mo Qingyun formed a hand seal and activated the array again.

Instantly, a colorful light curtain formed, enveloping the entire Jade Crystal Manor.

After doing this, Mo Qingyun did not follow everyone to the assembly hall but went towards Chu Lian's residence.

Chu Lian had been injured by Luoyuan and was not in good condition. Mo Qingyun wanted to see him.

In Chu Lian's residence,

"Qingyun, you're here!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun arrive, Du Luo and others showed a solemn expression and greeted him.

"How is Chu Lian's condition?" Mo Qingyun asked directly.

"Not optimistic!"

Du Luo sighed and said solemnly, "Mr. Chu's meridians were all shattered by the shockwave. Even if his injuries recover, his cultivation might drop significantly and he may become a cripple."

"Hmm, I know," Mo Qingyun said with relief. He nodded and entered Chu Lian's room.

Compared to Du Luo and others, Mo Qingyun knew more about Chu Lian.

He was very clear about the cultivation method Chu Lian practiced. As long as he still had a breath, given enough time, he could recover fully.

Compared to the injuries Chu Lian suffered back then from Li He, these current injuries were just a drop in the ocean.

"Master, you're here," Chu Lian greeted Mo Qingyun when he saw him.

"Hmm!" Mo Qingyun nodded and took out a crimson-blue medicinal pill, offering it to Chu Lian. "Take this Two Poles Breakthrough Pill. It should help your injuries recover faster."

"Two Poles Breakthrough Pill!"

Seeing the medicinal pill Mo Qingyun offered, Chu Lian's expression changed. He said in surprise, "Master, this medicinal pill can increase the chance of breaking through to the Pill Mansion realm by thirty percent. Using it for healing is a waste."

"Don't say more, just one medicinal pill and not much compared to your injuries," Mo Qingyun waved his hand, interrupting Chu Lian.

"Thank you, Master!" Chu Lian said with a look of gratitude. Then he stopped being fussy and took the medicinal pill, starting to recover his injuries.

Seeing Chu Lian take the medicinal pill and start recovering, Mo Qingyun stood up and walked out of the room.

After leaving Chu Lian's residence, Mo Qingyun headed towards the assembly hall.

Soon after, Mo Qingyun arrived at the assembly hall.

At this moment, the atmosphere in the assembly hall was somewhat oppressive. Everyone was immersed in silence without anyone speaking.

"Youngster, why are you just now coming!" Mo Xin said with a reproachful expression as she saw Mo Qingyun arrive. She pointed at Thousand Yi and said, "This guy wants to take Little Ling away."

Hearing Mo Xin's words, Mo Qingyun narrowed his eyes and asked Thousand Yi coldly, "You want to take Sister Ling away?"

"Yes!"

Under Mo Qingyun's gaze, Thousand Yi changed his expression and replied solemnly, "Taking Princess Ling back to Xuan Yue Palace is the order of the palace lord. Moreover, with her unique Phoenix Body constitution, she can only cultivate in Xuan Yue Palace's Nirvana Valley."

"Nirvana Valley!"

Hearing Thousand Yi's words, Mo Qingyun fell silent for a moment and pondered.

Thousand Yi was right. With her unique constitution, Mo Ling could only cultivate in a suitable environment and with the appropriate cultivation method.

Since this was the order of the Xuan Yue Palace lord, they should have a way to let Mo Ling cultivate.

Seeing that Mo Qingyun was silent, everyone looked at him. At this moment, they had already unconsciously regarded him as the main pillar.

After a brief silence, Mo Qingyun looked at Mo Ling and asked, "Sister Ling, what's your decision? If you don't want to go, no one can force you, not even Xuan Yue Palace."

In Mo Qingyun's view, it was better for Mo Ling to make her own decision. No matter what she decided, he would support her fully.

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, Thousand Yi changed his expression again and looked at Mo Qingyun with a different gaze.

With only the True Essence realm cultivation, Mo Qingyun dared to say such words. It was quite arrogant and presumptuous.

If not for Mo Qingyun having some backing, he would be a fool. Clearly, Mo Qingyun was not a fool.

Thus, Thousand Yi thought that Mo Qingyun must have some backing to say such words.

Moreover, he felt a sense of unease under Mo Qingyun's gaze. This puzzled him since Mo Qingyun was only at the True Essence realm.

Seeing that Mo Qingyun asked her to make a decision, Mo Ling fell silent and thought about it.

After some internal struggle, tears welled up in the corners of Mo Ling's eyes. She looked at Mo Yue Ru and everyone with reluctance and said, "I agree to go to Xuan Yue Palace."

Mo Ling paused and looked at Mo Yue Ru again. "Mother, you've suffered for twenty years because of my body. I don't want to see you suffer anymore. After solving the issue with my constitution in Xuan Yue Palace, I'll come back to you."

"Silly girl!"

Hearing Mo Ling's words, Mo Yue Ru showed a look of satisfaction and hugged Mo Ling tightly. Her face was filled with reluctance.

Seeing Mo Ling's decision, everyone did not say anything. They could understand the reason behind her decision.

Mo Ling's actions seemed heartless, but they were driven by filial piety.

Seeing Mo Ling make a decision, Mo Qingyun showed a solemn expression and asked Thousand Yi, "What is Luoyuan's status in Xuan Yue Palace? Will she pose a threat to Sister Ling after she goes to Xuan Yue Palace?"

Seeing Mo Qingyun ask about Luoyuan's status, Thousand Yi said solemnly, "Luoyuan's father is a guardian in the sect. You don't need to worry about Princess Ling's safety. No one dares harm her in Xuan Yue Palace. Moreover, after Princess Ling goes to Xuan Yue Palace, Luoyuan Sister will consider her status and probably won't pose a threat to the Mo family."

"That's best," Mo Qingyun nodded. He said coldly, "Also, tell Luoyuan that she better not have any ideas about the Mo family. Otherwise, even Xuan Yue Palace won't be able to protect her."
