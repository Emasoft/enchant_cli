Seeing the strength displayed by Chì Liàn, Zhōu Bóqīng’s face turned pale and he looked at Chì Liàn with a terrified expression.

He never imagined that several months ago, when Chì Liàn fought against them, he was only at the First Stage of Nascent Soul Realm.

In just a few short months, Chì Liàn’s cultivation had risen from the First Stage of Nascent Soul Realm to the High Stage.

This rate of cultivation was too terrifying, wasn’t it?

High Stage Nascent Soul Realm!

As soon as Zhōu Bóqīng spoke, everyone’s expressions twitched and they were once again stunned on the spot.

The red-haired old man beside Mò Qīngyún was actually a powerhouse of this level, comparable to their Zhōu Family’s ancestors.

Compared to the shock of others, Zhou Honghui was the most panicked at this moment.

Thinking about how several Nascent Soul Realm Elders had become cripples because of him, Zhou Honghui instantly thought about dying.

“Sss! High Stage Nascent Soul Realm, that red-haired old man is actually at the High Stage.”

Upon hearing this result, Zhou Honghui drew in a sharp breath and felt a surge of urine coming from his lower body, panicking: “Damn it, damn it, damn it, this is over for me. I brought these two fierce people to the family; I thought I was going to turn from a salted fish into a fresh one, but now it seems like I’m turning into a dried fish.”

At this moment, Zhou Honghui was panicked.

“Humph! You all are too arrogant.”

A cold and deep voice came from beneath the Zhōu Family.

It seemed that the person who spoke was an old-timer of the Zhōu Family, hidden in a secret room underground and cultivating.

Soon after, an old figure with a hunched back appeared before everyone’s eyes.

“Ancestor!”

Seeing this figure, the members of the Zhōu Family all showed joy on their faces and respectfully bowed.

At this moment, as the members of the Zhōu Family were bowing to this old man, several other elderly figures appeared one after another behind the Zhōu Family’s ancestor.

The aura of these people was extremely powerful, each approaching the High Stage of Nascent Soul Realm.

It seemed that they were all old-timers hidden in secret, focusing on their cultivation within the Zhōu Family.

Seeing that the situation of the Zhōu Family was not looking good, one by one they could no longer hold back and came out to deal with Mò Qīngyún and his companion.

Actually, before these people came out, Mò Qīngyún had already released his soul force to sense their presence.

“Arrogance?”

Seeing the old-timers of the Zhōu Family all come out, Mò Qīngyún’s lips curled into a faint smile as he looked at the old-timers of the Zhōu Family and said with a smile: “You old turtles finally decided to come out? Well, it’s better this way; I don’t have to go looking for each of you one by one.”

“Arrogant brat, find death!”

Upon hearing Mò Qīngyún’s words, an old man with Fifth Stage Nascent Soul Realm cultivation beside the Zhōu Family’s ancestor could no longer hold back his anger, his face darkened and he struck out at Mò Qīngyún with a palm.

Holy Light Ghost Palm

As this old man struck out, terrifying energy burst from his palm and a ghostly face formed in the palm shadow that pressed towards Mò Qīngyún.

However, facing this palm from him, Mò Qīngyún had a calm expression as if he didn’t care at all.

At this moment, Chì Liàn beside Mò Qīngyún snorted coldly and said: “Humph! I think the one looking for death is you.”

As Chì Liàn spoke, he raised his hand and struck out at this person, emitting a terrifying aura.

Under Chì Liàn’s attack, an enormous palm shadow condensed rapidly and struck towards this person.

Bang!

Facing Chì Liàn’s palm, this person could hardly resist and was directly struck flying, falling heavily to the ground.

Puh!

After being hit by Chì Liàn’s powerful palm, this person spat out blood when he landed and his face turned extremely pale.

Seeing this scene, the Zhōu Family’s ancestor immediately darkened and said coldly: “Sir, you are too domineering. Do you really think that with your High Stage Nascent Soul Realm cultivation, you can bully around in our Zhōu Family?”

“If you are not satisfied, just strike me.”

Facing the cold words of the Zhōu Family’s ancestor, Chì Liàn glanced at him disdainfully and replied indifferently.

“Humph! Since that’s the case, let me see what you are made of.”

As the Zhōu Family’s ancestor spoke, he moved and struck out at Chì Liàn with a palm.

At the same time, he said to the old men behind him: “Don’t just stand there; first strike that boy and kill him.”

“Yes, Uncle, Ancestor…”

Hearing the Zhōu Family’s ancestor’s words, those behind him nodded and responded.

“Do you take me for a soft touch?”

Seeing the actions of the Zhōu Family’s members, Mò Qīngyún curled his lips and showed a playful smile: “Since that’s the case, I’ll play along with you.”

The members of the Zhōu Family did not know Mò Qīngyún’s thoughts.

Seeing Mò Qīngyún’s smile, everyone showed a cold smile and said: “Boy, at this moment you still have the mood to laugh; are you scared silly?”

“Scared silly?”

Mò Qīngyún curled his lips and replied disdainfully: “With just you guys?”

Seal Door, Unseal!

As Mò Qīngyún spoke, he directly unsealed the seal on his Dānfǔ and no longer continued to talk nonsense with the members of the Zhōu Family.

Then, Mò Qīngyún’s aura immediately surged and in the blink of an eye reached the peak stage of Nascent Soul Realm.

Under Mò Qīngyún’s powerful aura, the Zhōu Family Elders who attacked him were immediately pushed back in shock.

Peak Nascent Soul Realm cultivation.

This seventeen or eighteen-year-old youth was actually a powerhouse at the peak stage of Nascent Soul Realm.

Such a thing, if not seen with one’s own eyes, even if they were beaten to death, they would not be able to accept it.

“Peak Nascent Soul Realm cultivation, how… is this possible?”

“How can a boy of his age have peak Nascent Soul Realm cultivation?”

“D… definitely an illusion!”

…

At this moment, the hearts of the Zhōu Family’s Elders were stirred with waves of shock and could not accept this fact.

As the Zhōu Family’s Elders were shocked, Zhou Tao felt Mò Qīngyún’s powerful aura and immediately widened his eyes in disbelief.

Several months ago, Mò Qīngyún’s cultivation was lower than his. In just a few months later, Mò Qīngyún had reached the peak stage of Nascent Soul Realm.

This was too strange and terrifying for him.

If this were true, what kind of cultivation speed did Mò Qīngyún have?

“How… how can this be, his cultivation could improve so quickly!”

Seeing Mò Qīngyún’s cultivation speed and comparing it to his own, Zhou Tao was instantly struck.

His cultivation speed compared to Mò Qīngyún’s was like a snail.

Bang!

Before the members of the Zhōu Family could recover from their shock at Mò Qīngyún’s display of cultivation, a more terrifying aura erupted beside them.

Bang!

Under this pressure, the Zhōu Family’s ancestor almost could not resist and was struck flying.

Puh!

The Zhōu Family’s ancestor spat blood when he landed, his expression twitching in fear as he looked at Chì Liàn: “Dānfǔ, you are a Dānfǔ Realm powerhouse!”

Dānfǔ!

This red-haired old man before them was actually a Dānfǔ Realm powerhouse, not the High Stage Nascent Soul Realm he thought.

Their Zhōu Family had actually offended a Dānfǔ Realm powerhouse.

More importantly, he was boasting in front of this person just now and said that he would meet him.

This was like looking for death.

Thinking of this, the Zhōu Family’s ancestor felt bitter in his heart, as if he had eaten a thousand flies.

At this moment, Zhou Bóqīng and others felt as bitter as the Zhōu Family’s ancestor, almost unable to describe their feelings.

Just now, just now, they were actually threatening a Dānfǔ Realm powerhouse and said that he would not be able to escape today.

With their strength, could they really hold a Dānfǔ Realm powerhouse?

This was like a joke.

At this moment, the members of the Zhōu Family realized that Mò Qīngyún and his companion coming to their family was not self-inflicted, but rather came prepared.

…

“Dānfǔ!”

Upon learning Chì Liàn’s cultivation, Zhou Honghui was instantly frightened and his legs trembled, a warm flow coming from his crotch.

He had actually been scared to pee himself.

However, at this moment Zhou Honghui did not feel the dampness below and said in fear: “This… this is completely over for me. I brought these two fierce people to the family, causing Elders and Ancestors to be injured by them. I’m not turning from a salted fish into a fresh one, but rather turning into dried fish oil.”

Thinking of this, Zhou Honghui collapsed on the ground with a blank mind.

At this moment, he almost imagined his next fate.

At this time, as the members of the Zhōu Family were frightened and panicked, Mò Qīngyún showed a faint smile and looked at the demented Zhou Tao, asking: “Now do you still say that we will not be able to escape today?”

“I…”

Upon being asked by Mò Qīngyún, Zhou Tao was speechless and did not know how to answer.

However, after a brief moment of daze, Zhou Tao showed an angry expression and turned to look at Zhou Honghui, roaring: “Zhou Honghui, it’s all your doing.”

Hearing Zhou Tao’s angry words, Zhou Honghui immediately twitched and recovered his senses, saying in fear: “Zhou… Zhou Tao Cousin, this… this is not my fault. I didn’t know their identities; besides, just now Elder Boshan praised me for doing a good job.”

Hearing Zhou Honghui’s words, the members of the Zhōu Family all showed ugly expressions and glared at Zhou Honghui.

Seeing everyone’s angry looks, Zhou Honghui immediately closed his mouth and dared not speak randomly again.

At this moment, as the members of the Zhōu Family were glaring at Zhou Honghui, the Zhōu Family’s ancestor showed a pleading expression and pleaded with Mò Qīngyún: “Sir, our Zhōu Family did not recognize your greatness. Please be magnanimous and give us a chance to make amends.”

“A chance to make amends?”

Hearing the Zhōu Family’s ancestor’s words, Mò Qīngyún glanced at him disdainfully and said: “Just now weren’t you all very domineering? Besides, if you can’t defeat someone and beg for mercy, there’s no such thing in this world.”

Mò Qīngyún knew clearly that if he and Chì Liàn were defeated at this moment, with the personalities of the members of the Zhōu Family, they would not let them go.

Therefore, after mocking the Zhōu Family’s ancestor with a glance, Mò Qīngyún showed an impatient expression and instructed Chì Liàn: “Quickly deal with them; I’ll wait for you outside.”

After Mò Qīngyún spoke, he moved and walked towards the outside of the Zhōu Family.

After receiving Mò Qīngyún’s instructions, Chì Liàn showed a cruel smile and looked at the members of the Zhōu Family, saying: “Hahahaha, since Young Master has ordered it, let me send you all on your way.”

As Chì Liàn spoke, he raised his hand and struck towards everyone without hesitation, acting decisively and ruthlessly.

Facing Chì Liàn’s attack as a Second Stage Dānfǔ Realm powerhouse, these people with the highest cultivation of Nascent Soul Realm in the Zhōu Family had almost no resistance and were slaughtered by Chì Liàn.

About an hour later.

“Young Master, everything has been taken care of.”

Chì Liàn came to Mò Qīngyún’s side and reported.

“Good, let’s go to the Star River Sect.”

Hearing Chì Liàn’s report, Mò Qīngyún nodded in satisfaction and stood up to head towards the Star River Sect.

Seeing Mò Qīngyún move forward, Chì Liàn did not say much and followed behind Mò Qīngyún.

Soon, the two of them arrived at the entrance to the Star River Sect.

Upon arriving at the Star River Sect, Mò Qīngyún did not waste words with them and directly instructed Chì Liàn to strike out, wiping them all out.

Under Chì Liàn’s attack, the Star River Sect had no luck and immediately fell into slaughter.

About two hours later, everyone in the Star River Sect followed the fate of those in the Zhōu Family.

Thus, the Star River Sect was wiped out.

“Let’s go, continue on our journey!”

After wiping out the Star River Sect, Mò Qīngyún instructed Chì Liàn and stood up to continue on their journey towards the Hundred Nations Battlefield.

One day after Mò Qīngyún and Chì Liàn left, the news of the Zhōu Family and Star River Sect being wiped out spread throughout Spring City.

The Zhōu Family and the Star River Sect were among the three major forces in Spring City, yet they were wiped out by someone in just one day.

When this news came out, the entire Spring City was stirred up.

“Do you think that the Zhōu Family and Star River Sect offended some terrifying force?”

“This is of course. Otherwise, with the strength of the Zhōu Family and Star River Sect, who could secretly wipe them out?”

“A force that can so strongly wipe out the Zhōu Family and Star River Sect must be extraordinary. Could it be one of the three major families in Xia Kingdom?”

“It’s not impossible, but from the fate of the Zhōu Family and Star River Sect, it’s better to be more humble in the future.”

“Right, there are always people beyond us and things beyond our reach. Being too arrogant is not good.”

…

For a moment, everyone in Spring City was sighing over the destruction of the Zhōu Family and Star River Sect.

In a simple little house in Spring City, an old man and a girl were shocked to hear the news of the Zhōu Family being wiped out.

“Grandpa, do you think that this has something to do with Young Master Mò Qīngyún?”

The girl showed an excited expression and asked the old man.

“It should not be Young Master Mò’s doing.” The old man thought for a moment and said: “Although the two of Young Master Mò are not weak, I don’t think they have the strength to wipe out the Zhōu Family. Moreover, among those wiped out this time is also the Star River Sect, which is not weaker than the Zhōu Family.”

“Oh!”

Hearing the old man’s words, the girl pursed her lips and showed an expectant expression, thinking: “Could it be you?”

…

In Spring City, as everyone was guessing the true reason for the destruction of the Zhōu Family and Star River Sect, Mò Qīngyún and Chì Liàn, the perpetrators, were unaware of the commotion they caused.

Time flew by, and ten days passed in a blink.

In a forest, an old man with red hair showed a solemn expression and guarded beside a youth of seventeen or eighteen.

At this moment, the youth’s aura was rapidly rising.

In an instant, his aura reached its peak.

Feeling the changes in the youth’s aura, the red-haired old man showed a surprised expression and said happily: “Young Master is about to break through.”

As the old man muttered, the youth beside him suddenly raised his aura again.

The youth had broken through.

“True Essence Realm Second Stage!”

After breaking through, the youth who had been meditating with his eyes closed showed a happy expression and opened his eyes.

This youth was naturally Mò Qīngyún, who had left Spring City.

After this period of cultivation, his cultivation finally advanced again and broke through from True Essence Realm First Stage to Second Stage.

This way, he would have added some assurance when entering the Hundred Nations Battlefield.

After breaking through, Mò Qīngyún continued to cultivate for a while and stabilized his cultivation.

Half an hour later, Mò Qīngyún stopped cultivating and stood up to say to Chì Liàn beside him: “Let’s continue on our journey!”

After Mò Qīngyún spoke, he moved and walked towards the front.

Seeing Mò Qīngyún move forward, Chì Liàn did not hesitate and followed.

Thus, Mò Qīngyún and Chì Liàn began their mad rush again.

Five days later.

A huge city vaguely appeared in the vision of Mò Qīngyún and Chì Liàn.

In front of this city, a huge city gate was erected with three characters written on it: “Border City.”

“Border City!”

Seeing the three characters on the city gate, Mò Qīngyún showed a faint smile. After nearly twenty days of rushing, they finally arrived at the entrance to the Hundred Nations Battlefield, Border City.

Seeing this, Mò Qīngyún and Chì Liàn did not hesitate again and rushed towards Border City.

“Help! Help!”

At this moment, as Mò Qīngyún and Chì Liàn rushed towards Border City, a woman’s cry for help reached their ears.

Behind this woman, several burly men were chasing her with sneering expressions.

Hearing the words behind them, the woman’s expression immediately became more panicked.

When this woman saw Mò Qīngyún and Chì Liàn, she immediately showed a surprised expression and rushed towards them quickly.

“Save me! Please save me!”

When the woman came to Mò Qīngyún and Chì Liàn, she showed a pleading expression and begged for help.

Seeing this scene, Mò Qīngyún’s expression changed slightly and thought: “The Hundred Nations Battlefield is indeed chaotic. Just arriving near Border City, before entering the battlefield, I encountered such a robbery.”

However, Mò Qīngyún did not feel repulsed by this.

On the contrary, seeing this scene, he felt more anticipation for the Hundred Nations Battlefield.

…

The several burly men behind the woman showed sneering expressions when they saw Mò Qīngyún and Chì Liàn.

“Young man, if you want to be a hero and save a beauty, you need to show some sincerity.”

After sizing up Mò Qīngyún and Chì Liàn, one of the burly men raised his head and spoke to Mò Qīngyún.

“Please… please save me!”

After that burly man spoke, the woman immediately changed her expression and pleaded with Mò Qīngyún.

As she spoke, she moved behind Mò Qīngyún and Chì Liàn as if using their bodies to shield herself.

At this moment, the several burly men in front of them showed subtle smug smiles.

Looking at their expressions, it seemed that they had some trick up their sleeves.

Seeing this, Mò Qīngyún’s expression changed slightly and a hint of suspicion rose in his heart, sensing something amiss.

Then, Mò Qīngyún became more cautious and released his soul force to observe their excitement secretly.

However, Mò Qīngyún did not pay too much attention to this. At present, the cultivation of these people was not high, only at the Middle Stage True Essence Realm.

With this level of cultivation, even if they tried to be tricky, they could not stir up much trouble.

Seeing the woman hide behind Mò Qīngyún, one of the burly men in front said coldly to him: “Young man, this woman is a great price we paid to get. If you want to take her away, give us ten million spirit stones and we will let her go.”

“Ten million spirit stones?”

Hearing their demand, Mò Qīngyún’s expression changed slightly and he smiled indifferently: “Did I say that I want to save her? Besides, you guys don’t have the qualifications to take my ten million spirit stones.”

“This…”

Hearing Mò Qīngyún’s words, the several burly men were all surprised. They did not expect Mò Qīngyún to answer like this.

According to their expectations, Mò Qīngyún should have stood up and saved the beauty.

At this moment, as these burly men were dazed, the woman’s expression quickly changed and she pleaded again: “Young Master, please save me. If I fall into their hands, they will definitely kill me. As long as you are willing to save me, I can give everything to you.”

As she spoke, the woman made a pitiful expression and moved her body slightly. The gaps in her tattered clothes revealed some pale skin, making people imagine.

Seeing the woman’s appearance, Mò Qīngyún seemed to understand something and showed a playful smile.

Then, he smiled faintly at the woman and said: “Don’t worry. Since you said that, I will definitely save you.”

Hearing Mò Qīngyún’s words, the woman and those burly men all showed delighted expressions and exchanged glances secretly.

The woman and the several burly men’s actions were very subtle. If not observed carefully, one would not notice.

But Mò Qīngyún had a Soul Essence Realm soul cultivation, his perception was powerful and incomparable to ordinary people.

Moreover, Mò Qīngyún was sensing carefully at this moment. Therefore, as soon as the woman and those burly men made their moves, he discovered them.

Seeing this, Mò Qīngyún’s guesses quickly had some answers.

It seemed that the woman and those burly men were in cahoots, deliberately staging a ruse to deceive passersby.

Mò Qīngyún had encountered such a scam before, so he was not surprised at all.

As the saying goes, there are wonders in this vast world. As long as one can think of it, anything is possible.

“Young man, since you want to save this little lady, then give us ten million spirit stones.”

At this moment, one of the burly men showed an impatient expression and urged Mò Qīngyún.

“Give spirit stones?”

Hearing the burly man’s words, Mò Qīngyún showed a faint smile and shook his head: “It’s not necessary to be so troublesome.”

“Young man, what do you mean by that?”

Hearing Mò Qīngyún’s words, the several burly men all changed their expressions and asked Mò Qīngyún with displeasure.

“Just kill you all, then everything is over.”

Mò Qīngyún smiled faintly and no longer paid attention to the several burly men, instructing Chì Liàn: “Deal with them.”

“Yes, Young Master!”

Hearing Mò Qīngyún’s instructions, Chì Liàn’s eyes flashed with blood and he sneered at the several burly men: “Young man, next time be more careful. Some people are not something you can extort.”

As Chì Liàn spoke, he raised his hand and struck towards them.

Then, a huge palm condensed rapidly from the sky and pressed down powerfully.

Bang!

Under Chì Liàn’s strike, several burly men were instantly turned into meat pies and fell to the ground without any aura.

Seeing Chì Liàn’s actions, Mò Qīngyún showed a faint smile and looked at the woman: “Alright, they are all dead. You can go now.”

However, this woman’s expression twitched when she saw this and showed a terrified look: “You… you killed them?”

“A few bad guys, killing them is nothing.” Mò Qīngyún smiled playfully and asked the woman: “Do you think they shouldn’t have died?”

“No… no, I didn’t mean that. They should die.”

Seeing Mò Qīngyún staring at her, the woman trembled and kept responding.

Seeing this reaction from the woman, Mò Qīngyún did not pay much attention to her and nodded at Chì Liàn before standing up and rushing towards Border City.

After Mò Qīngyún and Chì Liàn left, the woman was stunned on the spot for a while before regaining her senses.

After recovering, she looked at the several burly men buried in the ground and said bitterly: “Tie Tou, Er Gou… I told you that blocking the road to rob was not a good idea, but you didn’t listen. Today you finally tasted the bitter fruit of your actions.”

The woman sighed and moved the bodies of the several burly men, buried them, and left silently.

Mò Qīngyún and Chì Liàn did not know about the woman’s actions, but they also did not care much.

After a moment, Mò Qīngyún and Chì Liàn arrived at Border City.

However, when Mò Qīngyún and Chì Liàn reached the entrance of Border City, a powerful aura burst from the city gate.

Bang!

Then, Mò Qīngyún and Chì Liàn saw a thin figure being struck out from the entrance of Border City.

Puh!

When this person landed, he spat blood and had a wound half a foot long on his body, bleeding profusely with a wretched expression.

From the look of it, he probably did not have much time left to live.

At this moment, as Mò Qīngyún and Chì Liàn were surprised by the scene before them, a one-eyed man rushed over and came to this injured person’s side. He stepped on the other with his foot and said coldly: “Humph! Daring to compete for the battlefield key with me, you are looking for death!”

After the one-eyed man spoke, he raised his sword and slashed at this injured person, killing him.

After the one-eyed man killed the other, he took out a red triangular token from his pocket and left with a satisfied smile.

“Sigh! Another person died in the competition for the battlefield key. Who knows how many more will die in this competition.”

“Do you know that this Hundred Nations Battlefield is different from before? It’s said that there are a large number of treasures unearthed inside, causing everyone to rush in and making the competition for the battlefield key extremely fierce.”

“I also heard that among these treasures, there is an ancient treasure unearthed. Everyone is coming for this treasure.”

…

As the one-eyed man left, those around him whispered.

“Treasures unearthed?”

Hearing their words, Mò Qīngyún raised his eyebrows and showed a surprised expression. He did not expect to encounter unearthed treasures upon arriving.

After this brief surprise, Mò Qīngyún felt more anticipation for the Hundred Nations Battlefield and thought: “However, to enter the Hundred Nations Battlefield, it seems that I need to obtain a battlefield key.”

After some thought, Mò Qīngyún stood up and walked into Border City.

…

Entering the interior of Border City, Mò Qīngyún found that it was divided into inner and outer cities.

The outer city was extremely chaotic, with frequent fights and battles. Under the impact of these fights, the houses there were all in ruins.

After a simple glance at the outer city, Mò Qīngyún and Chì Liàn entered the inner city.

As soon as they entered the inner city, Mò Qīngyún felt that the security was much better. Patrol personnel would occasionally pass by.

These patrol personnel were not weak, all at the Nascent Soul Realm cultivation. Especially that patrol captain’s strength reached Seventh Stage Nascent Soul Realm.

Such a person, if placed in a small city like Spring City, would already be at the level of an ancestor.

Under such supervision, it was no wonder that the security in the inner city was much better.

Because of fewer fights, the mansions in the inner city were magnificent and grand. Every pavilion was decorated with jade carvings, splendid and resplendent.

In addition to this, there were many small vendors on both sides of the streets in the inner city, setting up stalls to sell various items.

Each item was strange and unique, with a special texture different from those on the Heavenly Soul Continent.

“These items…”

Seeing these items, Mò Qīngyún and Chì Liàn’s expressions changed immediately and they exclaimed: “They seem similar to that place, how is this possible?”

After this discovery, Mò Qīngyún and Chì Liàn showed solemn expressions. It seemed that they had made a significant discovery.

Then, without hesitation, the two of them began to examine each stall.

After examining for a while, a golden ring on one stall caught Mò Qīngyún’s attention.

“What is this…?”

Looking at the golden ring before him, Mò Qīngyún’s expression changed and his heart raced.

He never expected to encounter such a thing here.

At this moment, as Mò Qīngyún was excited, the stall owner forced a stiff smile and said to him: “This is a spirit beast ring. Once you use it to capture a demon beast, no matter what kind of demon beast it is, it will become obedient and become your spirit beast.”

From the stall owner’s stiff smile and awkward words, it seemed that he was a newcomer here.

“A spirit beast ring?”

Hearing the stall owner’s words, Mò Qīngyún was surprised and felt somewhat helpless.

This powerful item was described by the stall owner as an ordinary spirit beast ring. Mò Qīngyún did not know what to say, only sighing inwardly that the stall owner was really ignorant.

This golden ring before him, Mò Qīngyún had seen once before. Its power was earth-shattering; even when he was at the Supreme Realm, he suffered some losses under this golden ring.

Moreover, according to Mò Qīngyún’s understanding, this golden ring seemed to exist in only one place.

Now suddenly seeing this golden ring, Mò Qīngyún immediately showed a curious expression and asked: “Where did you get this golden ring?”

Hearing Mò Qīngyún’s words, the stall owner showed a look of contempt and replied: “Of course from the Hundred Nations Battlefield. Don’t you know that all items on these stalls are obtained by everyone from the Hundred Nations Battlefield?”

“Hundred Nations Battlefield!”

Upon hearing the stall owner’s words, Mò Qīngyún was instantly shocked and very surprised by this answer.

Then, he frowned slightly and thought: “Is this Hundred Nations Battlefield related to that place?”

After this discovery, Mò Qīngyún’s anticipation and curiosity for the Hundred Nations Battlefield increased.

“Hey, do you want this spirit beast ring or not?”

Seeing Mò Qīngyún holding the golden ring and not speaking for a long time, the stall owner became impatient and urged him.

“How much?”

Seeing the stall owner urging him, Mò Qīngyún no longer wasted words and asked about the price.

“One million spirit stones!” The stall owner replied without hesitation.

“One million spirit stones?”

Hearing the price, Mò Qīngyún was surprised and felt helpless again. He smiled bitterly: “This Soul-Binding Ring is only one million spirit stones, if the old guys knew this, they would probably be shocked to death.”

This was something that could threaten a Supreme Realm powerhouse. Mò Qīngyún never expected such a terrifying item to be sold for only one million spirit stones by the stall owner.

Could it be cheaper?

However, at this moment when Mò Qīngyún was surprised, the stall owner saw him not speaking for a long time and thought he found it expensive.

Then, the stall owner showed a thoughtful expression and said after a brief silence: “If you really want to buy it, but the spirit stones on your body are not enough, I can give you a discount.”

“A discount?”

Hearing the stall owner’s words, Mò Qīngyún was surprised and showed a bitter smile.

He never expected that such an incredibly cheap price of one million spirit stones could still be discounted.

Even if he was reborn as a Supreme Realm powerhouse, Mò Qīngyún found this somewhat unbelievable.

However, the next words of the stall owner made him even more speechless.

“Six hundred thousand spirit stones, this is the lowest price.”

The stall owner gritted his teeth and said a psychological bottom line price to Mò Qīngyún: “If you can accept this price, take it.”

From this, it seemed that this was really the stall owner’s psychological bottom line.

Hearing six hundred thousand spirit stones, Mò Qīngyún shook his head and did not know what to say.

Seeing Mò Qīngyún shaking his head, the stall owner became anxious and said: “Sir, you are silent and nodding, do you want to buy it or not?”

Seeing the stall owner’s expression at this moment, he seemed about to cry. It looked like he was really anxious.

There was no way; in Border City, the most abundant things were these treasures brought out from the Hundred Nations Battlefield.

Everyone did not know the true use of these treasures and were taking chances to sell them, catching one if they could.

Now that he had encountered a customer with an intention, the stall owner naturally did not want to give up. However, he never expected that the other party was so poor.
