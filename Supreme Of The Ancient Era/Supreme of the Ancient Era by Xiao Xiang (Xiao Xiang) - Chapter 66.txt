Blood surged wildly!

As soon as Mo Qingyun summoned the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul, he unhesitantly unleashed its divine ability to enhance his cultivation.

At this moment, facing Yan Qiuyang, Mo Qingyun dared not hold back. The threat that Yan Qiuyang posed to him was significant, and a moment of carelessness could lead to his downfall.

Such an outcome Mo Qingyun did not wish to see, so he decided that giving it his all was the safest option. With the divine ability of his martial soul unleashed, Mo Qingyun's aura immediately surged, and in no time he reached the Seventh Level of True Essence Realm.

Upon reaching the Seventh Level of True Essence Realm, Mo Qingyun felt a significant reduction in pressure. At this moment, the gap between him and Yan Qiuyang was finally narrowed.

"Twinsoul martial soul! A divine ability that enhances cultivation!"

Seeing the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul and the white light gate martial soul, Yan Qiuyang's expression changed dramatically, exclaiming in shock.

The talent Mo Qingyun displayed at this moment far exceeded his expectations, making him feel somewhat apprehensive. He never imagined that the seemingly insignificant boy would have the qualifications to compete with him.

"Twinsoul martial soul! This young man actually possesses a twinsoul martial soul!"

"This young man's talent is so strong, which kingdom's prodigy is he?"

"Moreover, this young man's martial soul divine ability is so powerful; it can enhance his cultivation and suppress others' cultivation. This is truly prodigious."

"His talent seems to be even higher than the Eighth Prince's; I never thought there would be such an existence in this Hundred Kingdoms Battlefield."

"This young man has never been heard of among the Ten Great Kingdoms; could he be from some small kingdom?"

...

At this moment, everyone around from the Puppet Kingdom showed expressions of shock.

The powerful talent and strength Mo Qingyun suddenly displayed made it hard for them to accept in the short term.

Furnace Sun Mountain-Splitting Blade

Amidst everyone's shock, Mo Qingyun wielded the Fire Silk Sword and raised his hand to slash at Yan Qiuyang with a powerful strike.

As Mo Qingyun slashed, an awe-inspiring aura burst forth from his body. Under this aura's influence, everyone felt as if Mo Qingyun was the heavens and earth.

Blade Aura!

This illusion made the Puppet Kingdom's people tremble, feeling astonished.

"Blade Aura! This young man has actually comprehended the aura of heaven and earth; his talent is truly prodigious."

"How many hidden cards does this young man have? Does he still have more powerful ones?"

"With his talent, we absolutely cannot let him escape; otherwise, it will be a great隐患."

"However, with his current strength, the Eighth Prince would find it difficult to keep him; unless he uses some powerful hidden cards."

...

Seeing Mo Qingyun's hidden cards, the Puppet Kingdom's people changed their expressions again, unconsciously showing a hint of worry.

At this moment, Yan Qiuyang looked at Mo Qingyun with a grim expression and coldly said, "Boy, your talent is so high that it's unparalleled in my life; I really can't bear to kill you like this."

Yan Qiuyang paused and then said, "Boy, I'll give you one last chance. If you submit to me now, I will spare your life."

"Then just show me what you've got; don't talk so much."

Mo Qingyun responded indifferently to Yan Qiuyang's words, his movements not slowing as he swung the Fire Silk Sword at him.

Soon after, a shocking dragon aura of fire burst from the Fire Silk Sword and fiercely slashed at Yan Qiuyang.

"Boy, since you are obstinate, I'll have to destroy you."

Seeing Mo Qingyun attack him, Yan Qiuyang's expression immediately turned grim.

Then a ball of light appeared in his hand, emitting an awe-inspiring aura.

As soon as this ball of light appeared, the sky and earth changed color, and the ground began to shake.

"Master, be careful!"

Seeing Yan Qiuyang's ball of light, Jiu Gong's expression changed and he exclaimed in alarm.

While reminding Mo Qingyun, Jiu Gong quickly activated the Nine Palaces Array Disk to release an array for defense.

"Dan Mansion Heavenly Gears!"

As Jiu Gong acted, Mo Qingyun's expression changed and a sense of shock rose in his heart.

Dan Mansion Heavenly Gears, the terrifying ball of light in Yan Qiuyang's hand was actually Dan Mansion Heavenly Gears. Only a high-stage Dan Mansion realm expert could凝聚such things.

Moreover, for a high-stage Dan Mansion expert to凝聚Dan Mansion Heavenly Gears would come at a great cost, causing their cultivation to stagnate for a short time.

It was unimaginable that someone would make such sacrifices for Yan Qiuyang,凝聚Dan Mansion Heavenly Gears as a hidden card.

Chapter 236: Black Xuan Hall Opens

Teleportation!

After a brief moment of shock, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and summoned his martial soul divine ability to call forth the teleportation gate.

Then a vortex appeared before Mo Qingyun.

Without hesitation, he rushed into the teleportation gate and vanished from his original spot.

Before leaving, Mo Qingyun did not forget to summon some Eye Demon corpses with a wave of his hand.

These were good things and could not be wasted.

When Mo Qingyun left, Jiu Gong's array was just completed, and a light curtain appeared where they had been.

This array light curtain blocked Mo Qingyun's teleportation gate, preventing the Puppet Kingdom people from seeing it.

After the array light curtain formed completely, Yan Qiuyang's Dan Mansion Heavenly Gear struck forcefully against it.

Bang!

A thunderous sound echoed, and a terrifying heavenly lightning aura burst from the array light curtain.

This heavenly lightning aura spread like a flood, causing layers of mud to surge around.

Soon, the area within one li of the Black Xuan Hall entrance became a huge pit filled with flames and heavenly lightning.

Outside the Black Xuan Hall, it had become barren land.

Seeing this scene, everyone from the Puppet Kingdom showed expressions of fear and unease.

If they had not run fast enough, they would have been roasted to ashes by the residual lightning aura.

"Good... Good terrifying Dan Mansion Heavenly Gear, high-stage Dan Mansion realm experts are truly formidable!"

Seeing the destruction caused by just one Dan Mansion Heavenly Gear, everyone from the Puppet Kingdom was shocked.

At this moment, their awe for high-stage Dan Mansion realm experts increased greatly.

"Is... that young man dead?"

"He seemed to set up an array just now, trying to resist the Dan Mansion Heavenly Gear!"

"Relying on one array to block this terrifying Dan Mansion Heavenly Gear, that young man was too naive."

"Now there's no array light curtain in this pit; the array must have been shattered by the Dan Mansion Heavenly Gear."

"Without the protection of the array, that young man must be dead for sure!"

...

At this moment, everyone from the Puppet Kingdom looked at the flames and lightning aura with sighs.

As they sighed, Yan Qiuyang's expression changed slightly as he muttered to himself, "Although I wasted one Dan Mansion Heavenly Gear, it's worth it to eliminate this prodigious young man."

From Yan Qiuyang's words, one could tell that he was very wary of Mo Qingyun's talent.

Boom...

At this moment, as everyone from the Puppet Kingdom showed expressions of shock, a loud sound came from within the flames and lightning aura.

Then there was an earthquake as the ground shook.

The tightly closed Black Xuan Hall door slowly opened at this moment.

Seeing the Black Xuan Hall door open, a young man beside Yan Qiuyang asked with an inquiring expression, "Eighth Prince, the entrance of the Black Xuan Hall is filled with flames and lightning aura; we can't pass through. What should we do next?"

Hearing this, Yan Qiuyang's brows furrowed slightly as he pondered and said, "Don't rush into the Black Xuan Hall; wait until the flames and lightning aura weaken before we enter."

After responding, Yan Qiuyang instructed, "Yan Er, have everyone rest and heal their injuries; once the flames and lightning aura weaken, we will enter the Black Xuan Hall."

"Yes, Eighth Prince!"

Hearing Yan Qiuyang's words, Yan Da responded immediately.

...

...

While Yan Qiuyang and the others were resting to recover their injuries,

a vortex of light appeared outside the Black Xuan Valley, and a young man around eighteen years old emerged.

This young man was Mo Qingyun, who had escaped through the teleportation gate using his martial soul divine ability.

"Phew! What a close call, I almost got stuck there."

Emerging from the teleportation gate, Mo Qingyun took a deep breath and showed an expression of relief.

Then he said with a serious look, "I didn't expect Yan Qiuyang to possess Dan Mansion Heavenly Gears; next time I meet him, I need to be more cautious."

If he hadn't had the martial soul divine ability of teleportation, he would have been in trouble.

"Where is this...?"

As Mo Qingyun expressed relief, Jiu Gong showed an expression of surprise and some confusion.

He remembered that he was setting up the array just now, so how did he end up here after completing it?

After a brief moment of confusion, Jiu Gong's expression changed as if he had an idea and exclaimed, "Teleportation! Young Master can actually teleport!"

This discovery shocked Jiu Gong greatly; his mind was a bit hazy.

Teleportation, this is something only experts at the Supreme realm can do. Mo Qingyun, who was merely at the True Essence realm, could actually do it.

This ability had shattered Jiu Gong's perception and was truly terrifying.

After a brief moment of shock, Jiu Gong carefully asked Mo Qingyun, "Young Master, what was that just now...?"

"Just a type of teleportation technique!"

Hearing Jiu Gong's question, Mo Qingyun did not hide and replied directly.

Given their relationship, there was no need to conceal it.

"Is there such a technique?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, Jiu Gong was surprised again and said with some bitterness, "If I had known Young Master could do this, I wouldn't have set up the array just now."

Hearing Jiu Gong's words, Mo Qingyun showed a puzzled expression and asked, "Why say that?"

"Reporting to Young Master, in order to resist Yan Qiuyang's Dan Mansion Heavenly Gear just now, I have already consumed eight-tenths of the array power in the Nine Palaces Array Disk."

Jiu Gong's tone was somewhat depressed and continued, "If we don't replenish the array power soon, the Nine Palaces Array Disk will not be able to set up arrays in the future, even simple teleportation arrays."

Hearing Jiu Gong's words, Mo Qingyun's expression changed and he asked solemnly, "What do we need to replenish the Nine Palaces Array Disk?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's question, Jiu Gong replied, "We just need to find Star Pattern Array Stones. There should be some in this Hundred Kingdoms Battlefield; I've seen them before."

"Star Pattern Array Stones? I'll have someone keep an eye out for them in the future."

Hearing this, Mo Qingyun nodded and said solemnly.

"Now that the entrance of the Black Xuan Hall is blocked by flames and lightning aura, we can't enter it for a short time. I'll take this opportunity to refine the Eye Demons."

With that, Mo Qingyun no longer hesitated and started refining the Eye Demons.

As he refined them, their bloodline power was extracted by Mo Qingyun.

Once the Eye Demon's bloodline power was extracted, Mo Qingyun refined it rapidly to strengthen his own eye bloodline.

Thus, time passed as Mo Qingyun continued refining the Eye Demons.

"A soul imprint connection has been severed!"

At this moment, as Mo Qingyun refined the Eye Demon's bloodline power, he felt a shock in his heart and an unease rose.

He sensed that the connection with one of the soul imprints he had planted was severed, indicating that someone who bore his soul imprint had died.

After this discovery, Mo Qingyun's heart sank and he guessed, "Could the Ten Great Kingdoms have attacked Red Powder City? I wonder how Brother Lu and the others are doing?"

After a moment of worry, Mo Qingyun's brows furrowed slightly and he thought, "Brother Lu and the others are in a room with my Small Zhou Tian Star Array outside. As long as they don't come out, there shouldn't be any danger."

With this thought, Mo Qingyun felt somewhat relieved and continued refining the Eye Demons while waiting for the flames and lightning aura outside the Black Xuan Hall to weaken.

Thus, five days passed.

Mo Qingyun had finally refined all the Eye Demons in his hands.

After these days of cultivation, Mo Qingyun's Heavenly Soul Demon Eye bloodline power had been greatly strengthened.

Now Mo Qingyun was confident that if he encountered Yan Qiuyang's puppet eye power ray again, he could forcefully defeat it.

"Ah! The flames and lightning aura outside the Black Xuan Hall have weakened; we can enter the Black Xuan Hall now!"

Discovering that the flames and lightning aura outside the Black Xuan Hall had weakened, Mo Qingyun felt delighted in his heart and showed an eager expression.

Then he no longer hesitated and headed towards the Black Xuan Hall.

Chapter 237: Hard to Cross the Dry River

"The flames and lightning aura outside the Black Xuan Hall have weakened; we can enter now!"

Seeing that the flames and lightning aura outside had weakened, Yan Qiuyang's expression changed as he said to everyone with a cold tone.

Then Yan Qiuyang led the way and rushed towards the Black Xuan Hall.

Whoosh!

As Yan Qiuyang and others headed for the Black Xuan Hall, a streak of light flashed through the air.

Soon after, that streak of light rushed into the Black Xuan Hall.

Someone had entered the Black Xuan Hall first.

"Someone has entered the Black Xuan Hall first?"

Seeing this, Yan Qiuyang and others' expressions changed as they said with urgency, "We need to speed up; we can't let that person get the advantage."

Then Yan Qiuyang and others sped up, chasing after the person ahead.

As they chased, Yan Qiuyang's expression turned狰狞and he gritted his teeth and said, "No matter who you are, if you want to snatch what belongs to me Yan Qiuyang, you will surely die."

Yan Qiuyang was very angry now.

He didn't expect to encounter so many troubles in this Black Xuan Hall journey. Just after dealing with a troublesome young man, another one appeared to disrupt his plans.

This had touched the limits of his patience.

As Yan Qiuyang and others sped forward, they soon entered the Black Xuan Hall.

Upon entering, they saw numerous passages before them.

These passages were like dragon boat race venues, with a black iron small boat in each river channel.

From the current situation, it seemed that to reach the other side, they had to use these small boats.

However, what puzzled everyone was that beside each boat in the river channels were red furnaces emitting terrifying heat waves.

After scanning the scene, Yan Qiuyang and others suddenly saw a young figure standing in one of the passages.

This person must be the one who entered the Black Xuan Hall first.

It's him!

Seeing this person's appearance, Yan Qiuyang and others' expressions changed as they showed shocked looks.

This person was Mo Qingyun!

Mo Qingyun hadn't died; he had escaped from Yan Qiuyang's Dan Mansion Heavenly Gear attack and even entered the Black Xuan Hall ahead of them.

Upon this discovery, Yan Qiuyang and others felt somewhat aggrieved and depressed.

In the previous confrontation, Mo Qingyun not only obliterated their puppet soul imprints, causing them mental trauma.

He also sealed Yan Qiuyang's soul and bloodline power in the battle with Yan Qiuyang, forcing Yan Qiuyang to expend a Dan Mansion Heavenly Gear.

But even so, Mo Qingyun had escaped unscathed, seemingly without any injuries.

Thus, in the previous confrontation outside the Black Xuan Hall, they seemed to have been thoroughly defeated.

Thinking this way, Yan Qiuyang and others couldn't help but feel a sense of defeat.

"Young man, you're still not dead!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun in the distance, Yan Qiuyang's expression turned grim as he said with gritted teeth.

He hadn't killed Mo Qingyun even after using the Dan Mansion Heavenly Gear, which made him feel great shame.

"I'm not dead; why should you be?"

Hearing Yan Qiuyang's words, Mo Qingyun shrugged indifferently and replied.

"Eight Prince, let's join forces to kill this young man now. In the Black Xuan Hall, he won't be able to escape!"

After this person spoke, he looked at Mo Qingyun with hatred and attacked him.

"Stop!"

Seeing the attack, Yan Qiuyang's expression changed as he tried to stop him.

But his words were a bit late; the person had already leaped and struck out with a palm.

Bang!

However, as this person attacked, a black gas rushed towards him and instantly turned him into dust.

"Ah!"

Seeing this, everyone's expressions changed as they gasped in shock and showed fear.

This person was at the Eighth Level of True Essence Realm, yet a mere black gas had instantly turned him into dust.

This black gas was terrifying.

"Don't be hasty; there's Black Xuan Gas in the Black Xuan Hall. If we fight here, we'll immediately be attacked by this gas."

After the person was turned into dust by the black gas, Yan Qiuyang's expression darkened as he reminded everyone, "There are three tests in the Black Xuan Hall. After we pass these three tests, we can deal with that young man."

"Yes, Eight Prince!" Hearing Yan Qiuyang's words, the Puppet Kingdom people nodded and looked at Mo Qingyun with hatred.

"The first test is called Hard to Cross the Dry River!"

Then Yan Qiuyang explained to everyone, "To reach the other side, we must use these small boats. But to make the boat float, we need to continuously melt materials in the furnace beside it and create a solution that can lift the boat. In essence, this first test is about财力."

"That's how it is!"

Hearing Yan Qiuyang's explanation, the Puppet Kingdom people showed understanding expressions and understood how to pass this first test.

At this moment, one person looked at Yan Qiuyang with a puzzled expression and asked, "Eight Prince, can any materials be used?"

"Yes!"

Yan Qiuyang nodded and said solemnly, "But compared to others, metal refining materials work best."

Hearing Yan Qiuyang's words, the Puppet Kingdom people showed delighted expressions and said excitedly, "Eight Prince, each of us in the Puppet Kingdom has a large amount of puppet refining materials in our spatial bags. This test is no challenge for us."

Then the Puppet Kingdom people started throwing puppet refining materials into the furnace to melt them and create a solution that could lift the boat.

As they threw the materials, they showed smug expressions and boasted to Mo Qingyun.

"Young man, are you poor and don't have materials to throw into the furnace to create a solution that can lift the boat?"

"Our spatial bags are full of puppet refining materials. Do you want us to give some to you?"

"Young man, just stay aside and watch us cross the river."

"I think this young man is very frustrated now, like a fly that has eaten excrement."

"That's right! This young man entered the Black Xuan Hall first but can only watch us cross. He must be very frustrated."

...

At this moment, the Puppet Kingdom people showed smug expressions and mocked Mo Qingyun.

They seemed to see themselves crossing the river while Mo Qingyun looked on with envy.

But as the Puppet Kingdom people showed smug expressions, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and thanked them, "I see how to pass this test now. Thank you for telling me the method."

After Mo Qingyun spoke, he no longer hesitated and started throwing various refining materials into the furnace.

Seeing Mo Qingyun's actions, the Puppet Kingdom people's expressions turned somewhat difficult.

Their current actions seemed to be kicking themselves; they had solved Mo Qingyun's problem for him.

Seeing this, Yan Qiuyang's expression turned dark and he scolded the people beside him, "You fools; if you ruin my plans because of this, I won't spare you."

"Eight Prince, we know our mistake," the Puppet Kingdom people said as their expressions twitched and they showed fearful looks.

Seeing their expressions, Yan Qiuyang's expression changed slightly as he looked at Mo Qingyun and said coldly, "Young man, even if you know the method to pass this test, the materials needed are not something you can afford."

"Is that so?"

Hearing Yan Qiuyang's words, Mo Qingyun smirked and said indifferently, "If that's the case, then watch this. See if my refining materials are enough."

After saying this, Mo Qingyun's actions sped up as he crazily threw refining materials into the furnace.

In terms of the quantity of refining materials, Mo Qingyun was not inferior to Yan Qiuyang and others; he had the inventory of thousands of people on him.

As Mo Qingyun crazily threw materials, the amount of solution in his river channel rapidly increased.

Soon after, the amount of solution in Mo Qingyun's river channel far exceeded that of the Puppet Kingdom people.

Seeing this, Yan Qiuyang's expression turned grim; he seemed to have miscalculated again.

As for the other Puppet Kingdom people, their faces turned pale with cold sweat on their foreheads.

From the current situation, it seemed that Mo Qingyun could easily pass this test because of their actions.

"How... how can this be? How can this young man have so many refining materials!"

"This must be fake; how could this young man's refining materials be more than ours!"

"I know, he must have collected these from the thousands of people he killed outside Jiu Gong's secret storage."

"We're in trouble now; we really messed up."

"Now this young man can easily pass the test, and it seems that we're ruining Eight Prince's plans."

...

At this moment, the Puppet Kingdom people showed grim expressions and felt a sense of panic.

They had wanted to mock Mo Qingyun with this, but ended up helping him; the result made them very frustrated.

Their actions were truly like kicking themselves.

However, this couldn't be blamed on them.

How could they have imagined that Mo Qingyun would collect the spatial bags of those thousands of people he killed outside Jiu Gong's secret storage and bring them along.

Seeing the Puppet Kingdom people's expressions, Mo Qingyun showed a faint smile and said, "In terms of refining materials, I'm not inferior to you; this time you miscalculated."

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, the Puppet Kingdom people felt their teeth itch but couldn't do anything to him.

This result made them feel like they were about to spit blood, feeling very aggrieved.

Chapter 238: I Won't Accompany You (Second Update)

Regarding Yan Qiuyang and others' performance, Mo Qingyun paid no attention and focused on throwing refining materials into the furnace.

As Mo Qingyun crazily threw, the amount of solution in his river channel rapidly increased; at the same time, the boat slowly floated up.

With the boat floating in the solution, Mo Qingyun could now cross the river with it.

However, he did not start crossing immediately but continued throwing refining materials into the furnace.

His idea was to create more solution, which would provide greater buoyancy; this way, he could cross the river more easily later.

Moreover, with so many refining materials on him, a little more wouldn't matter.

Compared to Mo Qingyun, the Puppet Kingdom people's situation was somewhat bleak.

As time passed, their speed of throwing puppet refining materials slowed down.

Each time they threw a material, they would consider it as if comparing which one was less valuable.

Seeing the Puppet Kingdom people's actions, Mo Qingyun showed a faint smile and mocked them, "You said you had plenty of puppet refining materials; why are you throwing so slowly? Are your materials running out?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, the Puppet Kingdom people's expressions stiffened and showed embarrassed redness.

Just now they were mocking Mo Qingyun for not having refining materials to throw into the furnace.

But in a blink, this situation fell on them; it was truly like reaping what they sowed.

However, the time for this retribution seemed a bit short.

The Puppet Kingdom people did not expect that so many refining materials would be needed to float the boat.

From the current situation, it seemed that the amount of solution required to float the boat had exceeded their limit.

At this moment, as the Puppet Kingdom people felt depressed, Mo Qingyun showed a faint smile and said to them, "If you don't have enough materials, would you like me to lend some?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, the Puppet Kingdom people felt even more depressed.

But before they could get angry, Mo Qingyun's expression changed and he said, "I almost forgot; the various river channels in the Black Xuan Hall cannot be accessed from each other, so I can't help you."

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, even if the Puppet Kingdom people were not very smart, they knew that Mo Qingyun was playing with them.

"Young man, don't be too proud."

At this moment, the Puppet Kingdom people showed grim expressions; one of them arrogantly said, "It's just some puppet refining materials; this won't be difficult for us."

After saying this, he took out several kinds of puppet refining materials; each was a relatively rare material.

After taking these materials, he showed a pained expression and gritted his teeth before throwing them into the furnace.

From his current look, he was very reluctant and did not seem as casual as he said.

"Black Iron Mother, Ice Soul Cold Stone, Smoldering Flame Copper..."

Seeing this person's actions, Mo Qingyun's expression first changed in surprise and then he clicked his tongue, saying, "Tsk tsk tsk... These materials are very precious; each is worth hundreds of thousands of spirit stones. Now they're being wasted like this; you're truly wasteful. If your family elders knew about this, they would surely be furious."

"Young man, my affairs don't need your concern!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, this person's expression twitched as if he was hit by the truth.

As this person gritted his teeth in anger, Yan Qiuyang showed a disdainful expression and added, "It's just some puppet refining materials; once we get the treasures in this Black Xuan Hall, it will all be worth it."

"Oh, is that so?"

Hearing Yan Qiuyang's words, Mo Qingyun's smile grew even more.

"I'm just worried that after you expend these materials and don't get anything, it will be a huge loss."

"Young man, shut up!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, the Puppet Kingdom people felt like they were about to go mad.

Mo Qingyun was clearly poking at their sore spots, revealing their weaknesses and hitting them where it hurt.

At this moment, as the Puppet Kingdom people's anger had not subsided, a scene that made them spit blood occurred.

After they threw the precious puppet refining materials into the furnace, not only did their boat not float up but it sank further.

Seeing this, the Puppet Kingdom people were dumbfounded and could not figure out what was happening.

How could this be?

At this moment, the Puppet Kingdom people were filled with confusion.

"How pitiful!"

Seeing the Puppet Kingdom people's puzzled expressions, Mo Qingyun looked at them sympathetically and said, "Don't you know about the density of objects? The density of the refined silver crystals you just threw is greater than that of the boat's material, refined gold and iron. If your boat could float up now, it would be truly strange."

As Mo Qingyun spoke, Yan Qiuyang and others beside him could no longer hold back and shouted at the Puppet Kingdom people, "You fools, after using up your puppet refining materials, switch to other items!"

At this moment, Yan Qiuyang was also very angry; he did not expect that so many materials would be needed to float the boat.

Now his spatial bag's puppet refining materials were almost used up; if it didn't work, he would have to switch to other materials.

At this moment, as the Puppet Kingdom people felt depressed, Mo Qingyun stopped his actions.

The amount of solution in his river channel was sufficient; he no longer needed to continue melting things.

"Haha, you all continue; I won't accompany you!"

Then Mo Qingyun showed a faint smile and walked to the boat, waving at Yan Qiuyang with a smile as he crossed towards the other side.

Seeing Mo Qingyun's actions, one of the Puppet Kingdom people showed a cold expression and said, "Hmph! I don't believe it; without the solution, I can't cross."

"Idiot, come back!"

Seeing this person's actions, Yan Qiuyang's expression changed and he shouted at him.

But as Yan Qiuyang spoke, this person had already pushed the boat forward.

At this moment, under his boat, there were continuous hissing sounds and wisps of fire appeared.

Plop!

Soon after, a hole appeared at the bottom of his boat; it was punctured.

Sizzle!

As this person's boat was punctured, a black gas burst from the river bottom and instantly struck him, turning him into dust in an instant.

Seeing this, the Puppet Kingdom people's expressions twitched and they no longer dared to have侥幸psychology; they honestly continued throwing items.

After a moment, with the Puppet Kingdom people paying an exorbitant price, their boat finally floated up and could勉强cross.

However, their speed was no faster than a snail; compared to Mo Qingyun's, it was far behind.

Thus, with Yan Qiuyang and others showing expressions of resentment, Mo Qingyun easily reached the other side.

"Everyone, I'll go ahead!"

After reaching the other side, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and waved at Yan Qiuyang and others.

Seeing Mo Qingyun reach the other side, the Puppet Kingdom people's expressions turned difficult; they showed envy, jealousy, and resentment.
