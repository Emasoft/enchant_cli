Exiting the cave, Long Yutian and others took a deep breath, feeling somewhat relieved.

“Thanks to Brother Mo again this time; otherwise, we would have been in grave danger.”

After calming their fears, Long Yutian smiled faintly and thanked Mo Qingyun again.

“Thank you!”

Following Long Yutian, Lu Fangliang and Ruoshui also thanked Mo Qingyun.

However, when Long Yutian was thanking him, Zuo Mu’s expression darkened and he snorted coldly: “Humph! Mo Qingyun, you’d better give us an explanation as to why we can’t summon our martial souls while you can.”

Upon hearing Zuo Mu’s words, Long Yutian and the others changed their expressions, showing a thoughtful look.

After Zuo Mu’s words, everyone suddenly realized that it was indeed as he said.

Just now, the eight of them could not summon their martial souls, while Mo Qingyun alone could.

This was rather unusual and made everyone ponder deeply.

“What do you mean by this? Do you think it was my senior brother who harmed you?”

Hearing Zuo Mu’s words, Ling Luo immediately showed an angry expression and responded: “Moreover, if my senior brother wanted to harm you, he could have just ignored you and let the Blood Marked Soul-Eating Bats attack you.”

“We were just talking casually, why are you so nervous? Could it be that you feel guilty?”

After hearing Ling Luo’s defense, Zuo Mu showed a cold smile and said disdainfully: “Humph! How do we know if his actions were to lure you into a false sense of security, making us let our guard down so he could strike us fatally?”

Seeing Zuo Mu’s actions, Mo Qingyun thought of the phrase “the thief crying ‘thief’.”

Then, a faint smile appeared on his lips as he looked at Ling Luo and asked: “Do you think the same?”

Although he knew Zuo Mu’s intentions, Mo Qingyun did not intend to expose him immediately but wanted to test Lu Fangliang and the others.

“Senior brother, I believe you wouldn’t do such a thing!”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s question, Ling Luo spoke without hesitation, showing his trust in Mo Qingyun.

“Haha, I also don’t believe Brother Mo would do such a thing!”

Following Ling Luo, Long Yutian smiled faintly and expressed his belief in Mo Qingyun.

He had seen the life-and-death bond between Mo Qingyun and Ling Luo, such people would not do despicable things.

Seeing Ling Luo and Long Yutian’s expressions, Lu Fangliang and Ruoshui hesitated slightly before saying: “We also believe Brother Mo wouldn’t do such a thing.”

In their view, with Mo Qingyun’s strength, if he wanted to deal with them, it wouldn’t be so complicated.

Moreover, if Mo Qingyun really wanted to deal with them, he didn’t need to save them in the Demon Bamboo Forest and cave.

Seeing everyone’s attitude, Mo Qingyun’s face showed a bright smile, satisfied: “You won’t regret your decision at this moment.”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Long Yutian and the others were stunned, somewhat puzzled by his meaning.

“What do you mean by this?”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Long Yutian asked with a slight coldness: “What do you mean?”

Ling Luo and the others, hearing Long Yutian’s words, looked at Mo Qingyun with puzzled expressions, waiting for his response.

“Haha, Brother Long, don’t be in a hurry; you’ll know soon!”

Regarding Long Yutian’s question, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and did not answer directly but looked at Zuo Mu and the others, saying solemnly: “Are you still pretending?”

“Y-you mean what by this?”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Zuo Mu and the others changed their expressions, showing some nervousness.

Seeing that Zuo Mu and the others were still pretending to be confused after hearing his words, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly again and said: “Have you heard of the Poison Shadow Incense?”

“What… What is this Poison Shadow Incense? I don’t understand what you’re saying.”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Zuo Mu became even more nervous and his tone became somewhat tense.

“Poison Shadow Incense?”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Long Yutian and the others showed puzzled expressions, looking at him with confusion.

Seeing Zuo Mu’s expression, Mo Qingyun’s smile grew even more. He continued: “It is said that if a person with an extraordinary martial soul inhales this Poison Shadow Incense, their martial soul will fall into a deep sleep and they won’t be able to summon it for a short time. Do you think I’m right?”

Long Yutian and the others were perceptive people; after Mo Qingyun’s hint, they immediately understood.

So it was the four brothers from the Zuo family who were up to no good.

In this case, they had been crying thief when they were thieves themselves, trying to turn the tables on Mo Qingyun.

Then, Long Yutian and the others looked at Zuo Mu and his brothers with intense hostility.

Seeing Long Yutian’s expression, Zuo Mu and the others showed some nervousness.

However, after a brief panic, Zuo Mu suddenly brightened up and said: “Mo Qingyun, you mentioned the Poison Shadow Incense; if a person with an extraordinary martial soul inhales it and their martial soul falls into a deep sleep, why are you fine? How do you explain this?”

Zuo Mu continued: “Brother Lu, now you should understand; this kid is stirring up trouble and trying to sow discord among us. You mustn’t be fooled by him.”

“Haha, I knew you’d say this!”

Seeing Zuo Mu still arguing, Mo Qingyun showed a faint smile and looked at him coldly: “If my guess is correct, the sachet should still be in your乾坤袋 (Qian Kun Bag), don’t you dare to take it out and let us verify?”

Sachet?

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Long Yutian and the others showed a look of realization.

They felt uncomfortable after smelling that scent, but didn’t think much about it because they couldn’t summon their martial souls at the time.

Now, after Mo Qingyun’s explanation, everything became clear.

“So it was really you who were up to no good?”

After figuring out everything, Lu Fangliang and the others showed dark expressions, glaring at Zuo Mu and his brothers with bared teeth.

Seeing that everything was exposed, Zuo Mu and the others no longer argued but showed sinister smiles.

“Young man, your performance surprised me; I didn’t expect you to know about the Poison Shadow Incense.”

Zuo Mu showed a sinister expression, looking at Mo Qingyun with a cold smile and said proudly: “But even if you expose us now, what can you do? Do you think with your current strength, you can fight against us?”

“Zuo Mu, you despicable little man!”

Hearing Zuo Mu’s words, Ruoshui showed a cold expression and glared at him angrily.

“Despicable and shameless?”

Hearing Ruoshui’s words, Zuo Mu showed a proud cold smile and continued: “In this world, it’s the victor who is king; as long as you win in the end, the process doesn’t matter.”

“Miss Ruoshui, to be honest, I’ve admired you for a long time; later on, I’ll show you how much I love you.” Zuo Mu showed a lecherous expression and kept looking at Ruoshui.

“Shameless, indecent!”

Seeing Zuo Mu’s lecherous gaze, Ruoshui showed a cold expression and spat at him.

“Shameless? Indecent?”

Seeing Ruoshui’s angry expression, Zuo Mu looked at her more boldly and said proudly: “You won’t think that way later; you’ll find me very manly.”

After responding to Ruoshui, Zuo Mu showed a proud smile and looked at Mo Qingyun again: “Young man, if my guess is correct, the ancient treasure should be on you.”

“Ancient treasure?”

Hearing Zuo Mu’s words, Mo Qingyun changed his expression slightly and was somewhat surprised by Zuo Mu’s words.

He didn’t expect that Zuo Mu, like Lei Hong, had heard the rumor about him obtaining an ancient treasure from somewhere.

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s serious expression, Zuo Mu smiled proudly and continued: “I’ll tell you the truth; I let you enter the Nine Palaces Secret Treasure together with me because of the ancient treasure on you. Now, don’t you regret it? It’s too late.”

Hearing Zuo Mu’s words, Ling Luo showed an angry expression and glared at him loudly: “Zuo Mu, you despicable little man! I tell you, my senior brother doesn’t have any ancient treasure.”

“Ling Luo, no need to explain,”

Seeing Ling Luo’s actions, Mo Qingyun showed a calm expression and waved his hand to indicate that he didn’t mind. He smiled faintly: “It seems I underestimated the person who wanted to frame me; he spread rumors so widely.”

“Ancient treasure?”

Hearing Zuo Mu’s words, Lu Fangliang and Ruoshui changed their expressions slightly and looked at Mo Qingyun with confusion.

Seeing Lu Fangliang and Ruoshui’s expressions, Long Yutian explained to them the reason.

After hearing Long Yutian’s explanation, Lu Fangliang and Ruoshui showed a look of realization.

“Young man, after talking so much nonsense with you, it’s about time,”

While Long Yutian was explaining to Lu Fangliang and Ruoshui, Zuo Mu showed an impatient expression and said coldly to Mo Qingyun: “Now I’ll give you a chance; hand over the ancient treasure immediately, then cripple your cultivation and kneel to beg for mercy. We might consider sparing you.”

“Kneeling to beg for mercy?”

Hearing Zuo Mu’s words, Mo Qingyun showed a bright smile and responded: “Zuo Mu, you seem to be too happy too early.”

“Young man, since I gave you a chance, if you don’t seize it, don’t blame us.”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Zuo Mu showed a dark expression and said coldly: “Your strength is indeed good, but with your own power, you’re not our opponents.”

“Who said I’m alone?” Mo Qingyun smiled playfully and responded to Zuo Mu.

“Do you still expect those four useless people to help?”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Zuo Sen showed a disdainful expression and pointed at Long Yutian and the others: “Young man, not to boast, even if I fight them four alone, it’s an easy task.”

Hearing Zuo Sen’s words, Long Yutian and the others frowned; they couldn’t deny that what Zuo Sen said was true.

Now, unable to summon their martial souls and having suffered injuries earlier, their strength had been affected; perhaps they were not Zuo Sen’s match.

“Is that so?”

When Zuo Sen finished speaking, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and handed four pills to Ling Luo and the others: “Each of you take one pill.”

“Brother Mo, what are these pills?”

Looking at the pills Mo Qingyun handed over, Long Yutian showed a puzzled expression and looked at him with confusion.

They clearly remembered that these pills were the ones Mo Qingyun made in the demon beast carriage.

Hearing this, Mo Qingyun nodded and responded to Long Yutian: “You’ll know after you take them.”

“Alright!”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Long Yutian and the others did not hesitate but took the pills one by one.

As soon as the pills entered their bodies, Long Yutian and the others immediately sensed a pure medicinal power circulating in their bodies.

Under this medicinal power, they felt that the martial souls which were asleep slowly awakened and connected with them.

Seeing this, Long Yutian and the others showed shocked expressions, feeling incredulous.

The pills Mo Qingyun gave them were actually antidotes for the Poison Shadow Incense; this result was beyond their expectations.

Mo Qingyun knew how to make antidotes for the Poison Shadow Incense!

At this moment, they finally understood why Mo Qingyun could summon his martial soul while they couldn’t.

Previously in the demon beast carriage, Mo Qingyun made five pills; now he gave them four and probably took one himself to neutralize the Poison Shadow Incense.

Thinking this way, all their doubts were resolved.

It turned out that Mo Qingyun had seen through Zuo Mu and the others’ plot and prepared a countermeasure.

Seeing this, Long Yutian and the others looked at Mo Qingyun with admiration and gratitude.

They knew clearly that if it weren’t for Mo Qingyun, they would have been in trouble.

“Brother Mo, we’ll remember this favor.”

At this moment, Lu Fangliang and the others showed serious expressions and looked at Mo Qingyun with gratitude.

Although their words were few, Mo Qingyun could sense the sincerity in their hearts.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun showed a satisfied smile and said: “Haha, let’s deal with these few stinky bugs first.”

“Alright!”

After hearing Mo Qingyun, Long Yutian and the others moved towards Zuo Mu and the others to settle accounts with them.

Seeing Long Yutian’s actions, Zuo Sen showed a cold smile and looked at Ling Luo and the others: “Humph! After swallowing a pill like a rat, do you think you can regain your strength? Do you think it’s some kind of vitality pill?”

Saying this, Zuo Sen showed a proud expression and continued: “Let me see how I can defeat you four alone; what if there are four extraordinary martial souls? Today, I’ll trample your four extraordinary martial souls underfoot…”

However, before Zuo Sen could finish his words, he started to stutter and couldn’t say the rest.

Blue Dream Butterfly Spirit, appear!

Sword Spirit, appear!

Devouring Soul Demon Wolf, appear!

Withered Bone Dragon, appear!

Because he saw Ling Luo and the others summoning their martial souls.

In no time, four powerful figures appeared above Ling Luo and the others, releasing strong soul power.

Ling Luo and the others could summon their martial souls again!

For Zuo Sen, this was like a thunderbolt from a clear sky.

It seemed that he had overestimated himself.

With Ling Luo and the others able to summon their martial souls, even if there were four of them, Zuo Sen couldn’t handle it.

“How… How could this be!”

Seeing Ling Luo and the others summon their martial souls, Zuo Sen was like a madman, shaking his head repeatedly and feeling extremely frightened.

Seeing Zuo Sen’s expression, Ling Luo showed a cold smile and asked: “What’s wrong? Didn’t you say you wanted to fight four of us alone? We’re all waiting for you.”

“Me… Me…”

Hearing Ling Luo’s words, Zuo Sen’s expression twitched and showed a look of fear.

Jokingly, with him saying he wanted to fight four alone, even if he took a vitality pill, he couldn’t become so brave.

“Brother Liang, this guy doesn’t dare to move; let’s take the initiative and attack.”

Seeing Zuo Sen showing fear and not daring to move, Ling Luo showed a cunning smile and said to Lu Fangliang and the others.

“Shouldn’t we help Brother Mo?”

Hearing Ling Luo’s words, Lu Fangliang frowned and looked at Mo Qingyun.

From his expression, he seemed a bit worried about Mo Qingyun fighting Zuo Mu and the others alone.

“Brother Liang, don’t worry about this; with my senior brother’s strength, he can defeat Zuo Mu and the others alone.”

Hearing Lu Fangliang’s words, Ling Luo responded casually: “Brother Liang, if you don’t move now, you won’t have a chance to later.”

“Ling Luo is right; we don’t need to worry about Brother Mo’s side!”

Hearing this, Long Yutian smiled faintly and agreed with Ling Luo; he had seen Mo Qingyun’s strength personally.

Hearing Long Yutian say this, Lu Fangliang no longer hesitated and Ling Luo and the others attacked Zuo Sen one after another.

Seeing Ling Luo and the others attacking him at once, Zuo Sen was frightened to the point of wetting his pants and said fearfully: “You… You four are attacking me alone; do you still have any face?”

“Have no face?”

Hearing Zuo Sen’s words, Ling Luo and the others laughed; wasn’t it Zuo Sen who said he wanted to fight them four alone earlier?

Hearing Zuo Sen’s words, Long Yutian and the others showed mocking expressions; Zuo Sen was too inconsistent.

“Young man, it was you who said earlier that you wanted to fight us four alone.”

Looking at Zuo Sen with disdain, Ling Luo showed a proud smile and continued: “What’s wrong? Now that we’re fulfilling your wish, are you so excited that you can’t speak clearly?”

“Me… Me…”

Hearing Ling Luo’s words, Zuo Sen stuttered and didn’t know how to respond.

“No need to thank us; we’re just considerate; later, we’ll definitely attack you with all our strength.”

Before Zuo Sen could finish his words, Ling Luo interrupted him and responded.

Considerate? Full strength attack?

Hearing Ling Luo’s words, Long Yutian and the others showed complex expressions, looking at him for a while without saying anything.

Zuo Sen, hearing Ling Luo’s words, was frightened pale and trembling all over.

However, Lu Fangliang and the others did not show mercy because of his fear but attacked him fiercely.

In no time, Zuo Sen was beaten to the ground like a dead dog by Ling Luo and the others.

While Ling Luo and the others were attacking Zuo Sen, Mo Qingyun was also fighting fiercely with Zuo Mu and the others.

“Young man, you’re too arrogant to fight three of us alone.”

During the battle with Mo Qingyun, Zuo Mu showed a dark expression and said coldly: “Now I’ll let you know the consequences of being too arrogant.”

“You won’t have that chance,”

Hearing Zuo Mu’s words, Mo Qingyun showed a disdainful smile and attacked them with full strength.

Gravity Suppression!

Golden Jade True Body

As soon as Mo Qingyun spoke, he displayed the Earth’s Essence and Golden Jade True Body; his aura immediately became powerful.

At the same time, Zuo Mu and the others felt a shocking pressure on them, making their actions somewhat difficult.

“This… This is Essence Power!”

Feeling the pressure on them, Zuo Mu and the others changed their expressions and showed fearful looks.

Furnace Sun Mountain-Splitting Saber

Before they could recover, Mo Qingyun took out the Fire Silk Saber and slashed at them powerfully.

As soon as it fell, a dazzling light appeared on the Fire Silk Saber, turning into a fire dragon saber beam and slashing at them powerfully.

As the fire dragon saber beam appeared, it released Essence Power; this was Fire’s Essence Power.

“Fire’s Essence Power, another kind of Essence Power!”

Feeling the Fire’s Essence Power in the fire dragon saber beam, Zuo Mu and the others twitched their expressions and felt extremely frightened.

They didn’t expect that Mo Qingyun had comprehended two kinds of Essence Powers; this was too shocking for them.

While Zuo Mu and the others were shocked, the twenty-meter-long fire dragon saber beam was already approaching them.

“Second Brother, Fourth Brother, use all your strength to defend!”

Seeing the fire dragon saber beam approaching rapidly, Zuo Mu’s expression twitched and he hurriedly said to his brothers.

Then, Zuo Mu and the others did not hesitate but defended with all their strength.

Bang!

As soon as the fire dragon saber beam hit Zuo Lin and the others, a loud sound was heard; an astonishing aura of power spread out.

At the same time, Zuo Mu and the others were blasted away; their faces turned pale and they spat blood.

“Pervert, I’ll kill you!”

Seeing Zuo Mu being blasted away, Ruoshui’s expression darkened and she slashed at him with a sword, releasing an ice-blue sword beam.

Puchi!

As the sword beam passed by, it brought a splash of blood; a small piece of flesh fell to the ground.

Whether by accident or on purpose, Ruoshui’s sword cut off Zuo Mu’s manhood!

Seeing this, Long Yutian and the others felt a chill in their lower bodies; cold sweat appeared on their backs.

This woman is really vengeful! Better not offend her.

At this moment, Long Yutian and the others couldn’t help but think this way; they looked at Ruoshui with strange expressions.

However, Ling Luo, who was not bothered by the complex emotions of others, said: “You really boast a lot; I thought you were so big down there, but there’s not even half an ounce of meat in your pants; you still dare to boast like that. What’s so manly about it? The stinger on a bee’s butt is bigger than yours by a circle.”

Not even half an ounce of meat? The stinger on a bee’s butt is bigger than yours by a circle?

Hearing Ling Luo’s words, Long Yutian and the others couldn’t help but laugh and cry at the same time; they were completely convinced of Ling Luo.

This kid is really domineering in this aspect, professional!

“Spit! Indecent!”

Hearing Ling Luo’s words, Ruoshui spat at him and glared at him fiercely before attacking Zuo Mu again.

Under Ruoshui’s attacks, in no time, Zuo Mu was killed by a series of sword strikes; his appearance was extremely tragic.

Seeing the state of Zuo Mu and the others, Ling Luo and the others were sweating coldly; they sighed at Ruoshui’s violent nature.

“Run!”

Seeing Zuo Mu and Zuo Sen, Zuo Lin and the others did not hesitate but ran away.

“Want to run?”

Seeing Zuo Lin and Zuo Cai’s actions, Mo Qingyun showed a faint smile and said coldly; he moved towards them.

Fierce Bird Breakthrough

Mo Qingyun took a step and his body turned into a streak of light, releasing powerful Essence Power.

Under the addition of this Essence Power, Mo Qingyun’s speed reached its peak; in an instant, he arrived behind Zuo Cai.

Then, Mo Qingyun slashed at Zuo Cai’s back with a sword.

Puchi!

With the sword falling, the weakest Zuo Cai was killed without any resistance.

“So fast! Senior Brother just now used Earth’s Essence, Fire’s Essence, and Wind’s Essence!”

“Then, Brother Mo comprehended three kinds of Essence Powers.”

“Three Essences? This… How is this possible!”

…

Knowing that Mo Qingyun comprehended three kinds of Essence Powers, Ling Luo and the others were shocked; they couldn’t believe it.

A True Essence Realm person comprehending three kinds of Essence Powers was really too fierce.

At this moment, Lu Fangliang and Ruoshui finally understood why Ling Luo and Long Yutian were not worried about Mo Qingyun earlier.

With Mo Qingyun’s current strength, even if the eight of them attacked him together, they might not be able to defeat him.

Seeing Mo Qingyun catch up with Zuo Lin, he slashed at him with a sword.

Zuo Lin and the others couldn’t withstand Mo Qingyun’s one move; Zuo Lin, facing Mo Qingyun’s sword, was also killed without resistance.

Thus, the four brothers from the Zuo family were wiped out; all of them were killed.

“Brother Mo, since the four brothers from the Zuo family have been killed, shall we continue to explore deeper into the cave?”

Seeing Mo Qingyun approach, Long Yutian showed a seeking expression and asked him.

At this moment, everyone subconsciously regarded Mo Qingyun as the main pillar of their group.

“Not in a hurry!”

Hearing Long Yutian’s words, Mo Qingyun waved his hand and said solemnly: “Let’s first recover our injuries; then, I’ll teach you a formation. After you master the formation, we can enter the cave.”

“Formation?”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Lu Fangliang and the others showed surprised expressions and looked at him curiously.

Clearly, Mo Qingyun’s words were somewhat unexpected; they didn’t expect that he knew combined formations.

“Right!”

Mo Qingyun nodded and said solemnly: “Once you master this formation, our exploration of the cave will become much easier; moreover, after mastering it, even if you encounter people with higher cultivation than you, you can still fight them.”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Ling Luo was eager and said expectantly: “Senior Brother, teach us quickly.”

While Ling Luo spoke, Lu Fangliang and the others showed expectant expressions; they wanted to see the power of this formation.

“Not in a hurry, let’s rest and recover our injuries first.”

Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and said to everyone: “Mastering a formation is not something that can be done in an instant; after you recover, I’ll teach you.”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, everyone nodded in agreement.

Then, Lu Fangliang and the others did not hesitate but started to recover their injuries.

Seeing them start to recover, Mo Qingyun also did not idle; he took some battlefield essence crystals and started to refine them.

Under Mo Qingyun’s refinement, pure essence power was extracted from the battlefield essence crystals and surrounded his body, forming an aura storm.

When this aura storm formed, the four people who were cultivating nearby were immediately startled.

Seeing the aura storm around Mo Qingyun, Long Yutian and the others changed their expressions; they were extremely shocked.

From the current situation, Mo Qingyun’s refinement speed was about three times faster than theirs.

“What a terrifying refining speed; what level is Brother Mo’s martial soul?”

“I think at least top-grade thirteenth-level, maybe even fourteenth-level; otherwise, his refining speed wouldn’t be so fast.”

“Senior Brother is really amazing; I’ve decided to follow Senior Brother from now on.”

“Haha, I have the same idea; following Brother Mo should be a good thing.”

“I wonder if Brother Mo will participate in the Great Imperial Examination; if he does, it would be great for us to enter the Grand Yan Martial Academy together.”

“Right; if Brother Mo participates in the Great Imperial Examination, it will be very interesting then.”

…

Seeing this, Long Yutian and the others changed their expressions; each of them expressed their thoughts.

After a brief conversation, Long Yutian and the others did not hesitate but continued to cultivate, recovering their injuries.

Regarding Long Yutian and the others’ performance, Mo Qingyun was unaware; at this moment, he was fully immersed in cultivation.

Under his frenzied refinement, the battlefield essence crystals were drained of their power and turned into ordinary stones that shattered.

Essence power from the battlefield was absorbed by Mo Qingyun, strengthening his body bit by bit.

In a blink of an eye, after one day.

Mo Qingyun’s aura reached its peak; he had advanced to the late-stage of True Essence Realm Second Level.

“About to break through?”

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun’s expression changed; he showed a look of surprise.

Then, without hesitation, he compressed his essence power and started to break through the realm barrier, advancing in cultivation.

Under Mo Qingyun’s powerful attack, the realm barrier was easily broken; his cultivation advanced successfully.

True Essence Realm Third Level!

After advancing in cultivation, Mo Qingyun’s aura rose again; his refinement speed of battlefield essence crystals also became faster.

As Mo Qingyun’s refining speed increased, the aura storm around him grew even stronger.

Seeing this change, Long Yutian and the others were once again startled.

“Brother Mo’s refining speed seems to have become even stronger; this refining speed is really terrifying.”

“Not right, Senior Brother’s cultivation seems to have entered True Essence Realm Third Level; he has advanced again!”

“Advanced again? His cultivation broke through when we entered the Nine Palaces Secret Treasure.”

“A few days ago, when I met Brother Mo, he was at True Essence Realm First Level; now he’s at Third Level. It won’t be long before my cultivation is surpassed by him.”

“Just wonder what realm Brother Mo’s own cultivation is at.”

“I think his own cultivation should be at the half-step True Essence realm; otherwise, he wouldn’t have comprehended three kinds of Essences!”

…

Seeing this, Ling Luo and the others were once again amazed.

“We should hurry up with our cultivation; otherwise, we’ll be left behind by Brother Mo soon.”

After a brief exclamation, Lu Fangliang showed a cold expression and said solemnly.

Hearing Lu Fangliang’s words, Long Yutian and the others did not hesitate but started to cultivate again.

Half a day later,

Mo Qingyun, who had been cultivating continuously, stopped and opened his eyes with a pleased expression; he slowly stood up.

When Mo Qingyun stood up, it immediately caught the attention of Lu Fangliang and the others; they stopped cultivating as well.

“Congratulations on Brother Mo’s cultivation breakthrough!”

Seeing Mo Qingyun stop cultivating, the four of them showed faint smiles and congratulated him.

“Haha, I made you wait for a long time!”

Hearing their congratulations, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and said: “Since everyone has recovered from injuries, I’ll teach you the Four Symbols Formation’s cultivation techniques.”

“The Four Symbols Formation has four parts: attack, defense, illusion, and assassination. I observed each of your characteristics earlier; they fit the Four Symbols Formation’s requirements.”

Mo Qingyun paused and continued: “Miss Ruoshui, your attacks are fierce; you can focus on the attack part. Brother Long’s魔龙骨甲 (Dragon Bone Armor) is better at defense; you’re suitable for the defensive part. Brother Lu has an advantage in soul power, so the illusion part suits you best. Ling Luo’s灵剑武魂 (Spirit Sword Martial Soul) is unpredictable; the assassination part suits you best.”

“Wow, Senior Brother, you’re amazing; you analyzed our characteristics so thoroughly.”

After Mo Qingyun’s explanation, Ling Luo showed a look of admiration and exclaimed.

Like Ling Luo, Lu Fangliang and the others were also shocked; they showed a look of admiration.

In just a few days, Mo Qingyun understood their combat characteristics so well; it was indeed not an easy feat.

Then, Mo Qingyun started to guide them in cultivating the Four Symbols Formation.

Lu Fangliang and the others were intelligent; after Mo Qingyun’s guidance, they grasped the essence of the formation and could cultivate it on their own.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun stopped guiding them; he walked to the side and took out battlefield essence crystals to continue refining.

This way, three more days passed.

After three days of cultivation, Mo Qingyun’s aura rose again; he reached the mid-stage of True Essence Realm Third Level.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun stopped and did not continue cultivating.

He wanted to see how well Long Yutian and the others had mastered the Four Symbols Formation after three days of practice.

Looking at them, Mo Qingyun showed a satisfied smile.

After three days of practice and coordination, Long Yutian and the others had initially mastered the Four Symbols Formation; they could barely unleash its power.

However, Mo Qingyun did not immediately lead them deeper into the cave; instead, he guided Long Yutian and the others again, pointing out some techniques for mastering the formation.

“Brother Lu, you focus too much on killing in your use of soul power; pay attention to its confusing effect as well.”

“Brother Long, your martial soul gives you a strong physique; in the future, focus on strength training and learn martial techniques from this aspect to enhance your advantage.”
