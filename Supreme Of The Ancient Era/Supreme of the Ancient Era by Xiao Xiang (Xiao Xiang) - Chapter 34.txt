The old man responded and followed Xue Zhenjiang into the Xue residence.

...

At this moment, when all factions were shocked by Mo Qingyun killing Xue Yunjie, Mo Qingyun returned to the Jadeite Mansion.

After returning to the Jadeite Mansion, Mo Qingyun found Mo Feipeng and asked, "Uncle, is the plaque ready?"

"It's already done!" Mo Feipeng laughed heartily and handed the plaque to Mo Qingyun.

Seeing the words on the plaque, Mo Qingyun smiled contentedly and said to Chil炼 (Red Refiner), "Old Red, let's go to the Xue residence."

...

"Go and report to the city lord immediately. Tell him that Young Master Dan is heading towards the Xue residence."

Seeing Mo Qingyun and Chil炼 leave the Jadeite Mansion for the Xue residence, Captain Li instructed a city guard.

"Yes, sir!"

...

Upon hearing Captain Li's instructions, the city guard responded and rushed towards the City Lord’s Mansion.

About a quarter of an hour after Mo Qingyun left the Jadeite Mansion, Du Luo and two elders arrived at the Jadeite Mansion.

"President Du Luo, two venerables."

Seeing Du Luo and his companions arrive, Mo Hongtian greeted them.

"President Mo, where is Qingyun?"

Seeing that Mo Qingyun was not there, Du Luo and his companions showed concern and asked Mo Hongtian.

Seeing them inquire about Mo Qingyun, Mo Hongtian replied solemnly, "Qingyun and Old Red are heading to the Xue residence."

"What? He went to the Xue residence!"

Hearing Mo Hongtian's words, Du Luo and his companions were shocked and worriedly said, "He’s causing trouble. He killed Xue Zhenyang's son; now going to the Xue residence is like walking into a trap and seeking death."

"Old Du, Old Xu, let's hurry over. If we’re late, it might be troublesome."

Zhao Qi urged Du Luo and Xu Yu anxiously.

"Alright!"

Then, the three of them did not hesitate any longer and set off towards the Xue residence.

...

At this moment, when Du Luo and his companions were heading to the Xue residence, the guard responsible for conveying messages finally arrived at the City Lord’s Mansion.

"City Lord, Captain Li asked me to inform you that Young Master Dan is heading towards the Xue residence."

...

Not long after, this guard arrived before Wan Lianyun and reported.

"What?"

Hearing the guard's message, Wan Lianyun’s expression changed, becoming tense and exclaimed, "You said that Young Master Mo is heading towards the Xue residence?"

"Yes, City Lord!" The guard nodded in confirmation.

"Yue Xuan, let's go to the Xue residence immediately!"

From the guard’s confirmation, Wan Lianyun did not hesitate and instructed Wan Yue Xuan.

Then, he led some guests from the City Lord’s Mansion and set off towards the Xue residence.

...

About half an hour later, in the main hall of the Xue residence.

"Yunjie, rest assured. Father will avenge you."

Xue Zhenyang held Yunjie’s corpse and said with grief, "Mo Family, I will exterminate your entire clan."

At this moment, as Xue Zhenyang was filled with grief, sounds of fighting came from outside.

Bang, bang...

Then, some Xue residence servants were forcefully driven into the mansion from outside.

"What’s going on?"

Feeling the commotion outside, Xue Zhenyang’s expression darkened and he grabbed a servant rushing towards the hall to ask.

"Master, it... it’s not good."

Hearing Xue Zhenyang’s question, the servant looked panicked and said, "The Mo Family people have come to our door."

"Mo Family!"

Hearing the servant’s answer, Xue Zhenyang clenched his fists tightly, veins on his neck bulging as he walked towards the entrance with a fierce expression.

Tap!

At this moment, when Xue Zhenyang and others arrived at the entrance, a sound of breaking wood was heard.

Clang!

Then Xue Zhenyang saw a broken plaque fall from the entrance of the Xue residence, making a crisp sound.

Seeing that the Xue residence’s plaque was torn down by Mo Qingyun and Chil炼, Xue Zhenyang’s expression darkened and he gritted his teeth.

Then when he saw the new plaque hung on the entrance, he trembled with rage.

Waste Xue Family, these four words were so glaring to Xue Zhenyang at this moment.

"Mo Family brat, you’ve gone too far!"

At this moment, Xue Zhenyang could no longer remain calm and roared at Mo Qingyun.

"Gone too far?"

Hearing Xue Zhenyang’s words, Mo Qingyun smiled disdainfully and said, "Old dog of the Xue Family, wasn’t it also going too far when your people sent a plaque to our Mo Family? If you want to be a courtesan, don’t set up a reputation for yourself and avoid being despised by others."

"Mo Family scoundrel, you’re looking for death!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Xue Zhenyang could no longer remain calm and raised his palm to strike Mo Qingyun.

"Wanting to move against my young master, you must first get past me."

Seeing Xue Zhenyang’s actions, Chil炼 moved and stood in front of Mo Qingyun, striking Xue Zhenyang with a palm.

Bang!

Under Chil炼’s attack, Xue Zhenyang’s palm was blocked and a loud sound echoed from their clash.

Then an astonishing force wave spread out, stirring up dust around them.

"Core Formation Realm Third Stage!"

Seeing Chil炼 easily block his palm, Xue Zhenyang’s expression changed and he looked at Chil炼 solemnly, coldly saying, "Sir, it’s not easy to reach Core Formation Realm Third Stage. Don’t make a mistake for yourself because of a small Mo Family and bring upon you an unendurable calamity. If you leave now, I won’t hold your earlier offense against you."

Hearing Xue Zhenyang’s words, Chil炼 smiled disdainfully and said, "You think too highly of yourself. With your Core Formation Realm Fourth Stage cultivation, you don’t have the qualifications to instruct me."

"Master, what happened? We sensed another Core Formation Realm cultivator’s aura just now."

At this moment, as Chil炼 spoke, several elders walked out from the Xue residence with puzzled expressions.

"That aura is from a Mo Family Core Formation Realm cultivator."

Hearing the elders behind him, Xue Zhenyang’s expression darkened and he replied coldly.

"Mo Family!"

Hearing Xue Zhenyang’s words, the elders’ expressions darkened and their eyes flashed with killing intent.

Seeing the elders arrive behind him, Xue Zhenyang sneered and said, "Boy, you’ll soon know that coming to the Xue residence was a foolish decision."

"Elders, I will hold this person off while you kill that boy."

Xue Zhenyang instructed the elders behind him and then rushed towards Chil炼 at high speed.

Soon, Xue Zhenyang was fighting with Chil炼 fiercely, their power surging wildly.

"Yes, Master!"

The elders beside saw Xue Zhenyang’s instructions and rushed towards Mo Qingyun.

Shadow Step

Seeing the elders of the Xue Family attack, Mo Qingyun retreated and said disdainfully, "The old dogs of the Xue Family are indeed shameless. Bullying a junior is bad enough, but they even gang up on him. The people of the Xue Family are truly shameless."

"Boy, you’re looking for death!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, the elders of the Xue Family turned dark and attacked him crazily.

Seeing the elders attack him, Mo Qingyun’s expression turned cold, preparing to use the power of his Dan Mansion.

"Who dares hurt my disciple!"

At this moment, as Mo Qingyun was about to unleash the power of his Dan Mansion, a domineering voice came from behind.

...

Then Mo Qingyun saw three figures appear in front of him, blocking the attacks of the Xue Family elders.

"Dan Alchemists Alliance Guild!"

Seeing Du Luo and his companions appear, the Xue Family elders’ expressions changed, looking somewhat displeased.

They could not accept that such a good opportunity to kill Mo Qingyun was ruined by the Dan Alchemists Alliance Guild.

Ignoring the elders’ anger, Du Luo and his companions smiled at Mo Qingyun and said, "Good disciple, are you injured?"

"If you had come a bit later, it would have been difficult to say."

Mo Qingyun smiled helplessly at Du Luo and his companions’ arrival.

Briefly scanning Mo Qingyun, finding him unharmed, Zhao Qi sighed in relief and said angrily to the Xue Family elders, "Rascals, daring to hurt my disciple. It seems I have to give you a taste of hardship."

After Zhao Qi’s words, he raised his palm and attacked the Xue Family elders with a Core Formation Realm Eighth Stage aura.

Facing Zhao Qi’s attack, the Xue Family elders’ expressions changed and they were filled with fear.

"Old Zhao Ghost, are you meddling too much?"

At this moment, as Zhao Qi attacked the Xue Family elders, a dissatisfied voice came from the side.

Then Mo Qingyun saw a middle-aged man and an elder arrive beside the Xue Family group.

The middle-aged man arrived and raised his palm to block Zhao Qi’s attack, intercepting it.

"Tai Zhenhai! This matter has nothing to do with your Tai Mountain Sect, right?"

Seeing his attack blocked by the other side, Zhao Qi said discontentedly.

"Just can’t stand your behavior!" The middle-aged man of the Tai Mountain Sect shrugged and replied disdainfully.

"Hmph! Let’s see how you can stop me today."

After Zhao Qi spoke, he raised his palm and attacked Tai Zhenhai.

"Wanting to fight with our sect master, you must first get past me."

Seeing Zhao Qi attack Tai Zhenhai, the elder beside Tai Zhenhai snorted and attacked him.

"Old ghost, let me play with you."

Seeing Tai Zhenhai and the elder plan to attack Zhao Qi together, Xu Yu sneered and attacked the elder beside Tai Zhenhai.

"Hey, those old fellows of the Dan Alchemists Alliance Guild are meddling again."

At this moment, as Zhao Qi and his companions were fighting fiercely, a mocking voice came from the distance.

Hearing this mocking voice, Tai Zhenhai asked for help from that person beside him, "Brother Long, lend me a hand and kill these old fellows."

"Alright!"

Hearing Tai Zhenhai’s request, the two from the Dragon Gang nodded and attacked Zhao Qi and Xu Yu.

"Hmph! Wanting to bully a junior, you should ask me first."

Seeing the Dragon Gang’s actions, Du Luo snorted and joined the battle, attacking them.

At this moment, the situation was chaotic to an extreme degree.

Seeing the current scene, the elders of the Xue Family sneered and approached Mo Qingyun, "Boy, let’s see who can save you now."

In their view, Du Luo and his companions were restrained by the Dragon Gang and Tai Mountain Sect, so no one could save Mo Qingyun now.

...

"Is that so?"

Facing the elders of the Xue Family’s encirclement, Mo Qingyun curled his lips and sneered.

Shadow Step

Then he moved swiftly, leaving a trail of afterimages as he retreated.

At this moment, when Mo Qingyun’s figure moved, a mysterious power emanated from his body.

Orbital Power!

At this moment, the power Mo Qingyun displayed was Orbital Power.

"This... This boy actually comprehended Wind Orbital Power!"

Seeing this, the elders of the Xue Family were shocked and could not believe it.

If they hadn’t seen it with their own eyes, even if you beat them to death, they wouldn’t believe it. After all, this was too incredible.

Mo Qingyun, with True Qi Realm cultivation, actually comprehended Orbital Power. Was there anything more incredible than this?

"What? That boy with True Qi Realm cultivation actually comprehended Orbital Power."

"How... How is this possible? Can someone with True Qi Realm cultivation comprehend Orbital Power?"

"We must eliminate this boy. This kind of talent is a disaster!"

...

At this moment, the people from the Dragon Gang and Tai Mountain Sect who were fighting saw the elders of the Xue Family’s words and were shocked.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun’s performance had completely exceeded their expectations.

"Good, good, good!"

Knowing that Mo Qingyun comprehended Orbital Power, Du Luo and his companions were also excited and cheered.

Du Luo smiled faintly and said, "It seems this boy has cultivation talent not inferior to his alchemy talent."

"Hmm, indeed. This boy is making us more and more surprised," Zhao Qi and Xu Yu responded.

"Hmph! No matter how good his talent is, today he will fall here."

The people from the Dragon Gang and Tai Mountain Sect all snorted coldly, their expressions dark.

Today they must eliminate this boy!

At this moment, the people from Tai Mountain Sect, Dragon Gang, and Xue Family all had such thoughts.

In their hearts, if they couldn’t eliminate Mo Qingyun with his talent early on, he would be a big trouble in the future.

Hearing the words of the Dragon Gang and Tai Mountain Sect people, Du Luo and his companions’ expressions darkened, feeling worried for Mo Qingyun.

After all, the words of the Dragon Gang and Tai Mountain Sect people were not false. With Mo Qingyun’s cultivation, facing the encirclement of the Xue Family elders, it was indeed somewhat dangerous.

Soul Heaven Seal

At this moment, Mo Qingyun unhesitatingly summoned eighteen Soul Battle Seals and attacked the Xue Family elders.

Puff, puff...

The Soul Battle Seals were attacks on souls. Even the Core Formation Realm elders of the Xue Family were directly hit and severely injured their souls under the attack of eighteen Soul Battle Seals.

"Ahhh... Mo Family scoundrel, you’re looking for death!"

The Xue Family elders all cried out in pain when hit by Mo Qingyun’s Soul Battle Seals, their expressions turning fierce.

With their Core Formation Realm cultivation, they were actually tricked by a junior in the situation of jointly dealing with him.

Unhesitatingly, this was an enormous disgrace that they could never erase in their lives.

"This boy... actually injured the elders of the Xue Family?"

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s situation, Du Luo and his companions were all stunned, unable to believe what they saw.

Mo Qingyun’s performance at this moment completely exceeded their expectations.

Du Luo and his companions sighed again, "Indeed surprising. This boy is becoming more and more unpredictable."

At this moment, as Du Luo and his companions were sighing, the Xue Family elders had already approached Mo Qingyun.

Gravity Suppression!

Seeing the Xue Family elders approach, Mo Qingyun unhesitatingly displayed Earth Orbital Power.

Under the Gravity Suppression, the Xue Family elders immediately felt a heavy force on their bodies, making them sink and almost fall.

Orbital Power again, Orbital Power!

Seeing this, the Xue Family elders’ expressions changed and their minds went blank.

This True Qi Realm boy actually comprehended two Orbital Powers. What kind of prodigious talent was this?

Two Orbital Powers, even they these Core Formation Realm experts could not achieve such a level.

"This... This boy actually comprehended Earth Orbital Power!"

At this moment, the Xue Family elders were all shocked and looked at Mo Qingyun in disbelief.

As soon as their words fell, the surroundings became quiet. Everyone was stunned.

Originally, Mo Qingyun comprehending one Orbital Power had already shocked them greatly.

Now they did not expect that Mo Qingyun comprehended two Orbital Powers instead of one.

A True Qi Realm boy comprehending two Orbital Powers, how prodigious was this?

Of course, if they knew that Mo Qingyun also comprehended Fire Orbital Power, it would probably scare them to death.

"This boy..."

At this moment, Du Luo and his companions were complex in their hearts, not knowing what to say for a while and could only smile bitterly.

At this moment, they truly discovered how terrifying Mo Qingyun’s cultivation talent was.

In the face of Mo Qingyun’s prodigious talent, they all felt a bit defeated unconsciously.

Seal Door, Unseal!

At this moment, as everyone was shocked by Mo Qingyun’s displayed talent, he unsealed some seals on his Dan Mansion.

Then the aura around him rose rapidly and reached Core Formation Realm in an instant.

Core Formation Realm!

Mo Qingyun’s aura actually reached the level of Core Formation Realm.

Seeing this, everyone was shocked again and looked at Mo Qingyun with wide eyes.

How many trump cards did this boy, Mo Qingyun, have hidden?

Under everyone’s dazed gaze, Mo Qingyun moved and punched one of the Xue Family elders.

Ninefold Collapse

Mo Qingyun’s fist struck out, and terrifying power formed nine fist shadows that enveloped the Xue Family elder.

"Xue Zhuang Elder, be careful!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s attack, Xue Zhenyang’s expression changed and warned the Xue Family elder.

However, although Xue Zhenyang immediately opened his mouth to warn, he was still a step too slow.

Bang!

As Xue Zhenyang spoke, the fist shadows Mo Qingyun struck out landed on Xue Zhuang’s body and directly sent him flying.

Puff!

Caught off guard, Xue Zhuang was severely injured by Mo Qingyun’s full-power attack. He spat blood and his complexion turned pale, his aura weakening, likely being crippled.

Seeing Xue Zhuang severely injured by Mo Qingyun’s powerful attack, everyone beside him were stunned.

They probably wouldn’t have thought of such an outcome even if they broke their heads.

The Xue Family’s several Core Formation Realm elders surrounded a True Qi Realm boy, not only failing to kill him but also having one of them severely injured by Mo Qingyun.

If you told this outcome to others, they probably wouldn’t believe it.

But there was no denying that this result was indeed ironic and would be the greatest shame for the Xue Family in the future.

"Pfft!"

As everyone was shocked by this outcome, a trace of blood appeared at Mo Qingyun’s corner of his mouth and his face turned red.

"Huh!"

Feeling the surging power fluctuations in his body, Mo Qingyun took a deep breath and said thankfully, "Fortunately, I only unsealed to Core Formation Realm First Stage. If higher, my body would probably burst."

"This boy’s means just now were not his own strength but borrowed from an external force."

"With his current cultivation, he can’t control that power. Now, he’s suffering from the backlash of that force."

...

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s current performance, everyone’s expressions eased a bit and guessed something.

But even so, they could not deny that Mo Qingyun’s means were indeed extraordinary.

"Hmph! Boy, you’re probably not doing well now. Let me see how many times you can borrow such power."

Knowing the subtlety, one of the Xue Family elders’ expression darkened and attacked Mo Qingyun again.

Dada...

At this moment, as the Xue Family elder was about to attack Mo Qingyun, a carriage rushed over.

At this moment, as the carriage approached, someone jumped out and quickly arrived in front of Mo Qingyun.

Then this person raised his palm to block the Xue Family elder’s attack.

"Haha, let’s talk nicely. Why get rough?"

Blocking the Xue Family elder’s attack, this person smiled and looked at everyone.

...

"City Lord Wan!"

"Wan Lianyun!"

Seeing the person who blocked the Xue Family elder’s attack, everyone’s expressions changed. Some looked displeased while others smiled.

The person who blocked the Xue Family elder’s attack was none other than Wan Lianyun, the City Lord of Liunancheng.

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s bloodstain at the corner of his mouth, Wan Lianyun looked concerned and asked, "Young Master Mo, are you alright?"

Mo Qingyun waved his hand and smiled faintly, saying, "Thank you for your concern, City Lord Wan. I’m fine."

After responding to Wan Lianyun, Mo Qingyun frowned slightly and thought, "The situation is getting more complicated. Even the four major forces of Liunancheng were stirred up today, so it’s impossible to eliminate the Xue Family."

Seeing Wan Lianyun appear, Tai Zhenhai’s expression darkened and said unhappily, "Wan Lianyun, this has nothing to do with you. I hope you don’t meddle."

"Haha, your matters are not mine to manage, but if anyone wants to harm Young Master Mo, I won’t agree."

Facing Tai Zhenhai’s threatening words, Wan Lianyun replied indifferently.

Because of Wan Lianyun’s appearance, both sides stopped fighting and were in a standoff state.

The Tai Mountain Sect, Dragon Gang, and Xue Family people were all agitated after hearing Wan Lianyun’s words.

From his words, they could clearly hear that Wan Lianyun was ready to confront them.

However, considering Wan Lianyun’s strength, the three forces of Tai Mountain Sect were also extremely wary of him.

Unless it was unavoidable, they did not want to clash with Wan Lianyun for the time being.

Especially now that the City Lord’s Mansion and Du Luo were on the same side, they were even more cautious.

After a brief silence, Tai Zhenhai’s expression darkened and looked at Wan Lianyun, saying, "Wan Lianyun, if you want to protect this boy, just have him self-inflict injuries and kneel down to apologize to the Xue Family Master. Then we’ll let you take him away."

After Tai Zhenhai spoke, he asked Xue Zhenyang for his opinion, "Xue Family Master, what do you think of my suggestion?"

"Tai Sect Master, since you’ve spoken up, then follow your words."

Xue Zhenyang nodded and tacitly agreed to Tai Zhenhai’s suggestion, looking at Mo Qingyun with a dark expression and saying, "If this boy self-inflicts injuries and kneels down to apologize to me now, I’ll spare him a dog’s life."

"Kneel and apologize? Spare his dog’s life?"

Seeing Tai Zhenhai and Xue Zhenyang acting in concert, Mo Qingyun sneered and said disdainfully, "Old dog of the Xue Family, Grandpa I clearly tell you that even if you kneel and apologize to me now, I won’t spare your Xue Family’s dog lives. Moreover, Grandpa I gave you the Xue Family plaque and haven’t even received your thanks."

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Du Luo and his companions’ expressions changed and sighed inwardly. This boy was indeed arrogant.

Plaque?

After a brief hesitation, everyone’s gaze fell on the Xue Family entrance.

Then the plaque with the words "Waste Xue Family" fell into everyone’s eyes.

Seeing this plaque, Du Luo and his companions looked at Mo Qingyun with strange expressions.

At this moment, they finally understood Xue Zhenyang’s anger. Mo Qingyun was challenging his psychological limit.

After glancing at Mo Qingyun, Zhao Qi smiled faintly at Xue Zhenyang and said, "Xue Family Master, this is your fault. My disciple kindly gave you a plaque; not thanking him was already bad enough, how could you repay kindness with resentment?"

"Xue Family Master, your actions are not very decent."

Xu Yu added, "This new plaque is so majestic and matches your Xue Family residence so well."

Majestic, matching?

Hearing Xu Yu’s words, the people from the City Lord’s Mansion beside looked at him with strange expressions.

At this moment, they could not help but marvel. Indeed, people gather by their kind and things by their nature.

Perhaps Mo Qingyun’s personality was related to Du Luo, Xu Yu, and Zhao Qi’s personalities.

The personalities of these three old men were indeed similar to Mo Qingyun’s.

"You... you’ve gone too far!"

Hearing Xu Yu and Zhao Qi’s words, Xue Zhenyang’s expression twitched and he trembled with rage.

After Xue Zhenyang spoke, Tai Zhenhai said with a hint of threat, "Zhao Qi, Xu Yu, it’s better for you to stay out of this matter. Don’t bring upon yourselves an incalculable calamity because of a momentary carelessness."

After warning Du Luo and his companions, Tai Zhenhai turned to Mo Qingyun and said coldly, "Boy, if you don’t want your relatives and friends to suffer calamities, now is the best time for you to self-inflict injuries and kneel down to apologize to Xue Family Master."

"What are you? A dog’s thing? Do you have a say here?"

Hearing Tai Zhenhai’s words, Mo Qingyun looked at him disdainfully and said, "I also warn you. If you don’t want your Tai Mountain Sect to be exterminated because of your words now, kneel down and apologize to me, slapping yourself a hundred times."

Mo Qingyun actually asked Tai Zhenhai to kneel and apologize, slapping himself a hundred times?

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, everyone around him changed expressions and were shocked by his actions.

"This boy is indeed arrogant!"

Du Luo and his companions, as well as Wan Lianyun and others beside him, could not help but sigh inwardly.

"A fool who thinks he can survive with Wan Lianyun’s protection."

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, the Dragon Gang leader Long Zhenjiang looked at him disdainfully.

"What are you? When did it become your turn to speak?"

Hearing Long Zhenjiang’s words, Mo Qingyun looked at him disdainfully and said coldly, "Don’t think that being a dog of the Xue Family will protect you. After I exterminate the Xue Family, I’ll go and exterminate your Dragon Gang."

A dog of the Xue Family? Exterminating the Dragon Gang?

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Du Luo and his companions were stunned again, not knowing what to say.

"Boy, you’re looking for death!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Long Zhenjiang’s expression darkened and he released a Core Formation Realm Seventh Stage aura towards Mo Qingyun.

"Long Zhenjiang, you’re also a famous figure in Liunancheng. What’s the point of bullying a junior?"

Seeing Long Zhenjiang release his aura towards Mo Qingyun, Zhao Qi looked at him disdainfully and released his aura to block Long Zhenjiang’s.

"You..."

Seeing Zhao Qi intervene, Long Zhenjiang’s expression darkened and glared at him.

"Everyone, give me a favor. Let this matter end here."

At this moment, as Du Luo and his companions were on the verge of conflict with Tai Zhenhai and Long Zhenjiang, Wan Lianyun smiled faintly and walked out.

Seeing Wan Lianyun intervene, Tai Zhenhai’s expression darkened and said to him with a hint of threat, "Wan Lianyun, don’t meddle in this matter. Don’t bring calamities to the City Lord’s Mansion."

"If I must intervene?"

Wan Lianyun said proudly, unafraid.

"Think you can with your current frail body?"

Tai Zhenhai said coldly.

"Frail body?"

Hearing Tai Zhenhai’s words, Wan Lianyun smiled and released his aura.

Core Formation Realm Ninth Stage!

Wan Lianyun’s cultivation was indeed Core Formation Realm Ninth Stage, living up to his reputation as the number one expert in Liunancheng.

"You... your poison is gone?"

Feeling Wan Lianyun’s aura, Tai Zhenhai and Long Zhenjiang were shocked.

This was indeed unexpected for them.

"Haha, this is all thanks to Young Master Mo. Otherwise, I would still be suffering from the toxins."

Wan Lianyun smiled and looked at Mo Qingyun with gratitude.

The poison on Wan Lianyun’s body was removed by Mo Qingyun!

After Wan Lianyun spoke, everyone was shocked and found it hard to believe.

Many people in Liunancheng knew about the poison on Wan Lianyun’s body, basically considered it incurable.

Even Du Luo and his companions from the Dan Alchemists Alliance Guild were at a loss, not expecting it to be removed by Mo Qingyun.

"This boy again!"

Knowing that Wan Lianyun’s poison was removed because of Mo Qingyun, Tai Zhenhai and his companions were furious.

"This boy is indeed surprising. He actually removed the poison from City Lord Wan’s body."

Du Luo and his companions smiled and looked at Mo Qingyun with satisfaction, marveling, "His alchemy ability is probably not inferior to ours now."

Thinking of this, Du Luo and his companions’ expressions changed with shock.

This meant that Mo Qingyun was already a Third Rank Alchemist, such a young Third Rank Alchemist was indeed prodigious.

After releasing his aura, Wan Lianyun smiled faintly and asked,

"Can I take Young Master Mo away now?"

"Hmph! We underestimated this time. Let’s see later."

Seeing the situation, Tai Zhenhai and his companions snorted coldly and left.

Seeing them leave, Mo Qingyun and the others did not hesitate and left as well.

...

After leaving the Xue residence, Mo Qingyun and others got into Wan Lianyun’s carriage and returned to the Jadeite Mansion.

"From today’s events, it can be confirmed that the relationship between Tai Mountain Sect, Dragon Gang, and Xue Family is extraordinary."

In the carriage, Wan Lianyun said solemnly.

"Tai Mountain Sect and Dragon Gang have always been ambitious. If they unite, Liunancheng won’t be peaceful in the future."

Hearing Wan Lianyun’s words, Du Luo and his companions sighed.

"In a month, the Cloud Sea Heavenly Realm will open."

At this moment, Wan Yue Xuan said worriedly, "If we clash with Dragon Gang and Tai Mountain Sect now, they will likely unite against us in the competition for Cloud Sea Heavenly Realm."

"This is unavoidable. Even if we don’t clash, they will secretly unite against us."

Wan Lianyun said solemnly, "Now it’s better to break the ice. Avoid being caught off guard by them later."

"Cloud Sea Heavenly Realm? What is this place?"

Hearing Wan Lianyun’s conversation, Mo Qingyun frowned and looked at him curiously.

"Cloud Sea Heavenly Realm is a cultivation realm of a powerful cultivator. It opens every three years, and in a month it will open again."

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s puzzled expression, Wan Yue Xuan explained, "Originally, this Heavenly Realm belonged to the City Lord’s Mansion alone. But for some reason, Dragon Gang and Tai Mountain Sect knew about it during the last opening."

"Later, after a fierce competition, we were outnumbered and had to compromise with them. We agreed that each side would send three True Qi Realm juniors for a competition, and the winner would gain access to Cloud Sea Heavenly Realm."

Wan Yue Xuan paused and continued, "The competition will be among three juniors from each side. The winner’s faction gets the right to enter Cloud Sea Heavenly Realm."

"Is that so?"

Mo Qingyun nodded in understanding.

"But this time, the competition is very disadvantageous for our City Lord’s Mansion."

After explaining to Mo Qingyun, Wan Yue Xuan said worriedly, "Originally, the participants were me and two guardians’ sons. But recently my cultivation reached True Essence Realm, so I can’t participate in the Heavenly Realm competition anymore. Therefore, we are short one participant, and it’s difficult to find a suitable substitute in the short term."
