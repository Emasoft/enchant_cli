However, he quickly arrived beside Mo Qingyun and began to protect him from any disturbances.

Seeing Mo Feipeng's actions, Mo Yueyu and the others also moved swiftly to stand beside Mo Qingyun.

"Actually breaking through in front of so many people, how reckless! I'll see if you can succeed."

Mo Cang's gaze turned cold as he thought to himself.

However, he did not interfere; after all, with so many people watching, he had some concerns.

Time passed slowly.

After about an incense stick's time, Mo Qingyun’s aura finally reached its peak.

Body Refinement Seventh Stage!

He had succeeded; Mo Qingyun’s cultivation had broken through and he entered the Body Refinement Seventh Stage.

Feeling Mo Qingyun’s aura change, those around him all changed expressions and showed surprise.

Mo Qingyun actually did it.

In front of everyone, he successfully broke through to the Body Refinement Seventh Stage.

"He succeeded! Mo Qingyun succeeded, it’s really unexpected."

"Such a breakthrough, his foundation must be very solid; otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to do it."

"Has anyone in the Mo family broken through like this before?"

...

Everyone had complex expressions, marveling at it in their hearts.

"This brat is really troublesome."

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s success, Mo Feipeng showed a look of surprise and joy as he laughed heartily.

"How many surprises has this kid given me in these past few months?"

Mo Yueyu looked at Mo Qingyun with a gentle gaze, her face filled with satisfaction.

"This brat, always showing off; doesn’t he care about others?"

Mo Xin glared at Mo Qingyun and smiled.

The two girls, Mo Ling and Mo Xiao, were the same.

"He actually succeeded!"

Compared to Mo Feipeng’s joy, Mo Cang was displeased. His face turned extremely ugly.

At this moment, when Mo Cang was secretly furious, Mo Qingyun opened his eyes and looked at Mo Cang with a fierce gaze. "Mo Cang, do you still think my cultivation will be insufficient for the clan competition?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Mo Cang’s expression changed slightly and then he said with disdain. "Just breaking through to the Body Refinement Seventh Stage, what’s there to be proud of?"

"Is that so?"

Mo Qingyun narrowed his eyes and said with a playful smile. "Don’t forget, in the last Moon Trial, my cultivation was only Body Refinement Fourth Stage. Now it’s Body Refinement Seventh Stage. With a month left until the clan competition, do you think my cultivation will still be Body Refinement Seventh Stage?"

When Mo Qingyun said this, those around him were shocked.

They realized they had overlooked something important: Mo Qingyun’s cultivation in the last Moon Trial.

If calculated, Mo Qingyun had broken through three stages within a month!

Breaking through three stages in a month, what kind of cultivation speed is this?

Everyone felt their minds were not enough to handle it.

This kind of cultivation speed was unheard of, terrifying.

"Breaking through three stages in a month, is this kid’s martial soul really just a first-grade martial soul?"

"Even if it were a tenth-grade martial soul, wouldn’t such cultivation speed be impossible? How did he do it?"

"This kid is very interesting, I’m getting more and more curious about him."

...

In a moment, everyone’s gaze converged on Mo Qingyun, making him the focus.

Hearing this, Mo Cang’s face turned extremely ugly and he glared at Mo Qingyun. "It’s laughable, the further you advance in cultivation, the slower your advancement becomes. Do you think you can maintain such a cultivation speed?"

"Laughable?"

Mo Qingyun smiled indifferently and replied. "What’s laughable about you? Your pride is your cultivation speed, isn’t it? In my view, you’re just a few years older than me."

A few years older!

Mo Qingyun’s words made everyone change expressions, pondering his meaning.

Mo Cang was eighteen years old now and Mo Qingyun was only sixteen. If they were the same age, their cultivation levels might be hard to compare.

Thinking this way, Mo Qingyun’s image in everyone’s hearts rose significantly.

"My martial soul is the tenth-grade Dark Demon Tiger Martial Soul, while yours is just a first-grade Lighting Martial Soul. What qualifications do you have to compare with me?" Mo Cang said arrogantly.

"A tenth-grade Dark Demon Tiger Martial Soul? With your cultivation speed, you still have the nerve to show it off?"

Mo Qingyun glanced at Mo Cang with disdain and said coldly. "In my view, anyone in the family with your martial soul would have a cultivation speed far better than yours. In my eyes, you Mo Cang without the Dark Demon Tiger Martial Soul are utterly useless."

Utterly useless? Mo Cang?

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s evaluation of Mo Cang, everyone changed expressions again and were shocked in their hearts.

However, thinking about Mo Qingyun’s words carefully, there was some truth to them.

Then, everyone looked at Mo Cang with a change in their gaze, less reverence and more disdain.

Seeing this, Mo Cang’s face turned extremely ugly as he glared at Mo Qingyun. "Humph! Sharp-tongued, in the clan competition I’ll see if you’re as powerful as you say. Hope you don’t embarrass yourself."

"I also tell you, clean your face and wait for me to hit it."

Mo Qingyun responded without backing down.

"Humph!"

Mo Cang snorted and left directly.

Seeing Mo Qingyun leave, Mo Qingyun also did not linger and followed him out of the training ground.

Chapter 40: Martial Soul Divine Skill (Second Update)

A few days later, in Mo Qingyun’s residence.

"My cultivation is now firmly at the Body Refinement Seventh Stage."

Mo Qingyun, in a state of cultivation, opened his eyes and left the cultivation with a pleased expression.

After returning from the training ground, Mo Qingyun entered into cultivation to stabilize his cultivation.

"Hmm? Why is my martial soul suddenly agitated?"

The fluctuations of the soul force from his martial soul made Mo Qingyun’s expression change, a hint of doubt rising in his heart.

Then, Mo Qingyun summoned the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon Martial Soul and the White Light Gate Martial Soul.

The Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon Martial Soul and the White Light Gate Martial Soul both emitted intense fluctuations of soul force.

Soon, Mo Qingyun realized that the soul force from the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon Martial Soul was gathering intensely.

Under the intense gathering of soul force, a miniature dragon shadow slowly formed.

This miniature dragon shadow instantly entered Mo Qingyun’s Heavenly Spirit and rooted in his sea of consciousness.

At this moment, a stream of information emerged from the miniature dragon shadow and entered Mo Qingyun’s mind.

"This is… martial soul divine skill!"

After digesting the information in his mind, Mo Qingyun’s expression changed to surprise.

On the Heavenly Soul Continent, generally when cultivators reached the True Qi Realm, they would awaken their martial soul and obtain its innate divine skill.

Mo Qingyun did not expect that now he was only at the Body Refinement Seventh Stage, his martial soul had awakened and granted him a divine skill.

Blood Qi Frenzy: Stimulate the body’s blood qi, the greater the intensity of the muscles and blood qi, the stronger the enhancement to strength.

This was the martial soul divine skill Mo Qingyun obtained from the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon Martial Soul.

"Blood Qi Frenzy, so powerful!"

From the surface meaning of these words, this martial soul divine skill seemed to be a growth-type divine skill.

It would enhance the strength加持 after being used as his own strength increased.

Blood Qi Frenzy

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and activated the martial soul divine skill Blood Qi Frenzy.

Soon, Mo Qingyun felt a latent force being stimulated and added to his body.

Under this latent force, Mo Qingyun clearly felt his strength surge instantly.

"Now I should have the qualifications to fight a Body Refinement Ninth Stage."

Feeling the power in his body, Mo Qingyun had confidence that although he could not defeat a Body Refinement Ninth Stage now, he should be able to maintain an undefeated record.

"Hmm, the White Light Gate Martial Soul seems to have awakened as well and is凝聚ing the seed of its innate divine skill."

At this moment, the changes in the White Light Gate Martial Soul caught Mo Qingyun’s attention and he showed a hint of anticipation.

The origin of the White Light Gate Martial Soul, Mo Qingyun had never fully understood, giving him a mysterious feeling.

Mo Qingyun always felt that the White Light Gate Martial Soul was not just a first-grade martial soul, possibly even more mysterious and powerful than the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon Martial Soul.

Thinking of this, Mo Qingyun became even more curious and anticipated the innate divine skill of the White Light Gate Martial Soul.

Soon, the fluctuations in the soul force from the White Light Gate Martial Soul stopped.

At this moment, the light gate of the White Light Gate Martial Soul finally opened, releasing a primordial aura.

"This aura is so powerful!"

Mo Qingyun’s expression changed, somewhat incredulous that the White Light Gate Martial Soul could release such a powerful aura.

"There’s actually a miniature light gate inside the White Light Gate Martial Soul!"

Looking at the opened White Light Gate Martial Soul, Mo Qingyun’s expression changed again in surprise.

"It’s not, this is the seed of the White Light Gate Martial Soul’s divine skill!"

After a brief moment of confusion, Mo Qingyun’s expression changed to surprise.

As Mo Qingyun was surprised, the seed of the White Light Gate Martial Soul’s divine skill also entered his Heavenly Spirit and rooted there.

Seal Door: The stronger the soul force of the caster, the more domineering the sealing power. Can seal flesh and blood, can seal divine souls, can seal all things in heaven and earth.

"This… this martial soul divine skill is too terrifying!"

Mo Qingyun’s expression was shocked, somewhat unable to believe that there were such terrifying martial soul divine skills in the world.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun could be sure that the origin of the White Light Gate Martial Soul was more mysterious and powerful than the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon Martial Soul.

Because only a stronger martial soul would give birth to a more powerful martial soul divine skill.

How could a low-grade martial soul give birth to such a powerful martial soul divine skill?

"Only wonder how powerful the Seal Door martial soul divine skill is."

Thinking this, Mo Qingyun became somewhat impatient and wanted to see the power of the Seal Door martial soul divine skill.

Then, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and got up to head towards Purple Bamboo Mountain.

In the Purple Bamboo Mountain, one could constantly find spiritual herbs and there were many beasts as well.

In Mo Qingyun’s eyes, these beasts were the best sparring partners for him next.

Because this Seal Door martial soul divine skill was too extraordinary and powerful, Mo Qingyun did not want others to know about it. So, finding beasts as sparring partners was the best choice.

Mo Qingyun knew clearly that with the power of the Seal Door martial soul divine skill, once others found out about it, it would be a bad thing.

It was like carrying jade in one’s bosom and inviting disaster, when your ability is not enough to protect the treasure you have.

This was also a kind of hidden disaster.

...

A few days later, in the depths of Purple Bamboo Mountain, a dense forest.

"Seal Door, seal!"

A thin youth of fifteen or sixteen pointed at a Green Azure Dragon Snake.

Then, a light gate condensed intensely on his finger and instantly entered the body of the Green Azure Dragon Snake.

When the light gate entered the body of the Green Azure Dragon Snake, its cultivation weakened intensely.

From the initial Body Refinement Tenth Stage, it instantly fell to the middle Body Refinement Ninth Stage, a whole half realm.

Blood Qi Frenzy

The youth shouted and instantly his aura rose.

From the initial Body Refinement Seventh Stage, it soared to the peak of Body Refinement Eighth Stage, approaching the Body Refinement Ninth Stage.

This youth was naturally Mo Qingyun who had left the Mo family and come to Purple Bamboo Mountain for training.

Ninefold Collapse

After activating these two martial soul divine skills, Mo Qingyun also activated the martial technique Ninefold Collapse and struck out at the Green Azure Dragon Snake with a palm.

With this strike, a powerful force surged from his palm and entered the body of the Green Azure Dragon Snake.

Bang bang bang bang bang!

When this force entered the body of the Green Azure Dragon Snake, it produced a series of muffled sounds, impacting its body.

Crack...

Under the impact of this frenzied force, a series of bone cracking sounds emerged from its body.

Then, the aura of the Green Azure Dragon Snake gradually weakened until it disappeared.

One strike! A Body Refinement Ninth Stage Green Azure Dragon Snake died.

At this moment, if there were people from the Mo family here and saw this scene, they would be stunned.

Mo Qingyun had grown to such a level already.

"It seems that the Seal Door martial soul divine skill has weaker effects on stronger opponents."

After these days of constant attempts, Mo Qingyun had a clear understanding of the power of Seal Door.

The stronger the opponent, the weaker its effect.

Against a Body Refinement Tenth Stage person, it could only weaken their cultivation by half a realm, but even so, it was still very powerful.

As for True Qi Realm beasts, Mo Qingyun did not provoke them; he was not yet at the point of thinking his life was too long.

In these days of battling beasts, Mo Qingyun had a rough understanding of his strength.

Without any trump cards, relying solely on the intensity of his muscles and qi, his strength was comparable to a Body Refinement Eighth Stage.

After activating the martial technique Ninefold Collapse, he could fight against a Body Refinement Eighth Stage peak but would not be able to defeat it.

With Blood Qi Frenzy and martial techniques, he could fight a Body Refinement Ninth Stage ordinary beast but would not be able to defeat it at the peak.

With all trump cards activated, he could barely fight a Body Refinement Tenth Stage middle beast but would struggle at the late stage.

If he encountered a Body Refinement Tenth Stage peak beast, Mo Qingyun would wisely choose to escape.

Because not long ago, he encountered a Body Refinement Tenth Stage Red Sun Fire Ox; even with all his trump cards activated, he was still severely beaten.

If not for the Red Sun Fire Ox’s lack of length, Mo Qingyun might have been left there.

Apart from this, recently Mo Qingyun also discovered another use of the Seal Door martial soul divine skill.

It could be used on himself to conceal his true cultivation level.

After discovering this use, Mo Qingyun instantly had some plans.

In the future, he could use it to conceal his true cultivation level, allowing him more trump cards.

Chapter 41: Body Refinement Ninth Stage

"I’m now familiar with the martial soul divine skills, it’s time to improve my cultivation."

Mo Qingyun knew clearly that cultivation was the foundation of a martial artist.

Without powerful cultivation as a base, even the most powerful martial soul divine skills and techniques were in vain, unable to fully display their power.

Thinking this, Mo Qingyun prepared to return to the Mo family and enter seclusion for cultivation.

"The cave where I went with Mo Xiao last time seems more suitable for entering seclusion."

When preparing to leave Purple Bamboo Mountain, Mo Qingyun’s eyes lit up and he thought of a better place for seclusion.

"The underground lava force there not only helps in alchemy but also allows the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon Martial Soul to absorb flame force and strengthen itself."

Thinking this, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and set off for that cave.

About half an hour later, Mo Qingyun arrived at the cave.

Due to his improved cultivation level, when he came here again, the heat from inside the cave gave him less pressure.

Entering the cave, Mo Qingyun went straight to its deepest part.

At the bottom of the cave, he took out the Crimson Flame Cauldron and medicinal herbs to start refining pills.

Half a day later, an aroma of the pill emerged from the cauldron.

The pills were done; red-colored pills quietly appeared in the cauldron.

"Third-grade primary! Nine Nourishing Qi Pills."

Seeing the grade of the pills, Mo Qingyun showed a hint of joy and said. "The underground lava’s flame force really helps in refining pills, improving the quality of the pills."

"With these nine third-grade primary Nourishing Qi Pills, my cultivation should reach Body Refinement Eighth Stage."

After taking the pills from the cauldron, Mo Qingyun showed a hint of anticipation.

Then, he did not hesitate and took one Nourishing Qi Pill, sat cross-legged, and began cultivation.

The pill entered his body and instantly turned into medicinal power, permeating his blood qi and muscles.

Under the influence of the Nourishing Qi Pill’s medicinal power, fine streams of inner qi quickly formed in his blood and muscles.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun was delighted and absorbed the medicinal power of the Nourishing Qi Pill.

Three days later, Mo Qingyun absorbed and refined three Nourishing Qi Pills.

Under the influence of these three pills, his cultivation reached Body Refinement Seventh Stage middle peak, just a step away from the late stage.

Seven days later, Mo Qingyun refined and absorbed seven Nourishing Qi Pills.

After absorbing these seven pills, his aura reached its peak at Body Refinement Seventh Stage late.

"Break through for me!"

Mo Qingyun shouted and gathered all his inner qi, striking towards the barrier of Body Refinement Eighth Stage.

Bang!

At this moment, Mo Qingyun seemed to hear a rumbling sound from his body.

Body Refinement Eighth Stage!

He succeeded; with this burst of effort, he broke through the barrier to Body Refinement Eighth Stage.

Although his cultivation had broken through, Mo Qingyun did not stop cultivating.

He took the last Nourishing Qi Pill and continued to cultivate, stabilizing his Body Refinement Eighth Stage cultivation.

Three days later, Mo Qingyun emerged from cultivation with a look of joy on his face.

Body Refinement Eighth Stage initial peak.

After these three days of cultivation, with the help of the Nourishing Qi Pills, not only did his cultivation stabilize but he also advanced further.

"Eighteen days have passed since the last Moon Trial."

Mo Qingyun calculated the time and considered his next steps. "Twelve days remain until the clan competition; perhaps I can reach Body Refinement Ninth Stage before the clan competition."

"Then don’t hesitate, refine another batch of Nourishing Qi Pills and fully break through to Body Refinement Ninth Stage."

Mo Qingyun took out the Crimson Flame Cauldron and medicinal herbs without hesitation, starting to refine pills.

Half a day later, the Crimson Flame Cauldron emitted an aroma of the pill; the Nourishing Qi Pills were done.

"Ten, one more than last time, still third-grade primary."

Seeing this harvest, Mo Qingyun showed satisfaction and put the Nourishing Qi Pills in a jade bottle.

Then, he took one Nourishing Qi Pill and began cultivation to improve his cultivation level.

A few days later, Mo Qingyun opened his eyes from cultivation.

Body Refinement Ninth Stage!

Feeling the frenzied force in his body, Mo Qingyun showed a look of joy; after ten days of intense cultivation, he finally reached Body Refinement Ninth Stage.

Then, Mo Qingyun entered cultivation again to stabilize his Body Refinement Ninth Stage cultivation.

One day later, Mo Qingyun opened his eyes again; his Body Refinement Ninth Stage cultivation was now stable.

"Now that my cultivation has broken through to Body Refinement Ninth Stage, tomorrow is the clan competition day; it’s time to return."

Mo Qingyun calculated the time in his heart. Before leaving, he thought, "If I return like this, it will be too shocking; better to conceal my cultivation level a bit."

Seal Door, seal!

Under the influence of Seal Door’s soul force, Mo Qingyun’s cultivation gradually weakened until it stopped at Body Refinement Seventh Stage peak.

After handling this, Mo Qingyun did not linger and left the cave after a simple cleanup.

A few hours later, Mo Qingyun returned to his residence.

To his surprise, Mo Xiao and Mo Ling were there in his residence.

"Xiao Xiao, Ling Sister, why are you here?"

Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and greeted the two girls.

"Qing Yun, where have you been these days? Uncle Feipeng and the others haven’t seen you for a while, they’re all worried."

Seeing Mo Qingyun return, the two girls relaxed and said with concern.

"Hmm!"

Mo Qingyun was somewhat surprised, chuckled, and replied. "I went to Purple Bamboo Mountain for training; I just returned today."

"Oh, that’s it."

The two girls showed understanding and believed Mo Qingyun. Then they said, "We’ll go tell Uncle Feipeng first so he won’t worry too much."

"Okay!" Mo Qingyun nodded.

Then, the three of them went to Uncle Feipeng’s residence to report their safety.

"I heard Mo Cang has reached Body Refinement Tenth Stage peak."

"Body Refinement Tenth Stage peak! Mo Cang is too strong; in the Mo family’s clan competition, no one has reached this level before."

"There’s nothing to do; Mo Cang is a tenth-grade Dark Demon Tiger Martial Soul, with outstanding talent and fast cultivation speed."

"Then Qing Yun is in trouble; a Body Refinement Tenth Stage peak Mo Cang isn’t ordinary."

...

On the way to Uncle Feipeng’s residence, some young people’s words reached Mo Qingyun’s ears.

"Body Refinement Tenth Stage peak!"

Knowing Mo Cang’s cultivation level, a faint smile appeared on Mo Qingyun’s lips and he felt some anticipation for tomorrow’s clan competition.

Chapter 42: Spirit Hall (Second Update)

Soon, the three of them arrived at Uncle Feipeng’s residence.

Coincidentally, Mo Feilin and Mo Yueyu were there as well; seeing Mo Qingyun return, the three of them relaxed.

"You little monkey, where have you been these days? We’ve all been worried about you."

Mo Feilin smiled faintly, ruffled Mo Qingyun’s head, and asked with concern.

Feeling their care, Mo Qingyun was moved and replied, "These days I went to Purple Bamboo Mountain for training; just returned today."

To Purple Bamboo Mountain for training!

The three of them changed expressions, looking at Mo Qingyun with a relieved and affectionate gaze.

Now everyone in the Mo family was saying that Mo Qingyun had extraordinary talent and a great fortune, making his cultivation advance rapidly.

Little did they know that Mo Qingyun’s achievements were due to his hard work.

A month of solitary and arduous training in Purple Bamboo Mountain, who could understand the loneliness and hardship?

Behind every success is ten or a hundred times more hardship and bitterness.

Mo Qingyun was like this now.

Behind his cultivation advancement were the hardships and sweat others did not know about.

"Little fool, you must have suffered a lot these past months; come sit down and tell us how you spent the month."

Knowing Mo Qingyun’s whereabouts, Uncle Feipeng and the others’ gazes softened with concern.

Then, Mo Qingyun sat beside Uncle Feipeng and briefly recounted his month’s experiences.

Of course, he did not mention his martial soul divine skills or fighting a Body Refinement Tenth Stage beast.

After all, these were too shocking to reveal.

Moreover, these things related to his trump cards; if revealed, he would have fewer advantages.

"Single-handedly fought a Body Refinement Eighth Stage beast!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Uncle Feipeng and the others were alarmed and heartened.

Body Refinement Eighth Stage beasts had astonishing combat power; some gifted beasts could even fight Body Refinement Ninth Stage martial artists.

The danger of Mo Qingyun fighting them was unimaginable; a misstep could be fatal.

Of course, besides being alarmed, Uncle Feipeng and the others were more amazed by Mo Qingyun’s strength.

Unconsciously, Mo Qingyun had grown to such a level that he could fight Body Refinement Eighth Stage beasts.

If not for Mo Qingyun’s own words, they could hardly imagine how fast he had progressed.

"Good kid, it seems you can stand on your own now."

Uncle Feilin laughed heartily and patted Mo Qingyun’s shoulder with satisfaction.

Then, Uncle Feilin stood up and said to Mo Qingyun, "Come, show me your strength."

"Okay!"

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and stood up to face Uncle Feilin.

Since rebirth, he had never fought a True Qi Realm person; with this opportunity, he did not want to miss it.

"Fourth Uncle, I’m here!"

Mo Qingyun smiled and struck out with a fist, the force on his fist frenzied.

Bang!

Then came a muffled sound as Mo Qingyun’s fist struck Uncle Feilin’s palm.

Following was a counterforce, causing Mo Qingyun to step back a few steps.

"Body Refinement Seventh Stage peak!"

After testing, Uncle Feilin quickly knew Mo Qingyun’s cultivation level and showed surprise.

Mo Qingyun’s cultivation had reached Body Refinement Seventh Stage peak, just a step away from the Eighth Stage.

After the last Moon Trial ended, Mo Qingyun’s cultivation was just at Body Refinement Seventh Stage.

In a month, his cultivation was about to break through again; this cultivation speed was astonishing.

To Uncle Feipeng and the others, Mo Qingyun’s martial soul was just a first-grade one.

A first-grade martial soul had cultivation speed comparable to ninth or tenth-grade ones, which was remarkable.

Moreover, Mo Qingyun’s progress in a month seemed less than the previous months.

But you must understand, Body Refinement Seventh Stage is a high stage of the Body Refinement Realm; after reaching this realm, inner qi凝聚s in the body, a qualitative improvement.

Therefore, after Body Refinement Seventh Stage, cultivation speed slows down; advancing one stage in a month is very terrifying.

"Good, good, good!"

Knowing Mo Qingyun’s cultivation level, Uncle Feipeng showed surprise and satisfaction.

He could imagine the hardships Mo Qingyun endured in these past months, the sweat he shed; otherwise, his cultivation would not have advanced so much.

"By the way! Uncle Feipeng, where’s Mo Xin?"

After chatting with Uncle Feipeng and the others, seeing Mo Xin not there, he asked.

"Since the last Moon Trial ended, she’s in seclusion."

Speaking of Mo Xin, Uncle Feipeng showed a look of satisfaction and said with a smile. "This girl wants to break through to the half-step True Qi Realm before the clan competition; she’s as strong-willed as her mother."

"Looks like Mo Xin isn’t giving up either, not wanting to be caught up by Mo Cang."

Knowing Mo Xin’s situation, Mo Qingyun chuckled.

"It can’t be helped; this is related to the opportunity to enter the Spirit Hall, so she’s working hard."

Uncle Feilin chuckled and said with a serious expression.

"Spirit Hall?" Mo Qingyun showed confusion.

"The Spirit Hall is a secret place in the family; only the clan leader and his successor can enter. Additionally, every year, the first-place winner of the clan competition can also enter for one month."

Uncle Feilin explained to Mo Qingyun, "The Spirit Hall is rich in essence energy; breaking through the True Qi Realm there has a double effect. Moreover, it’s said that one day of cultivation in the Spirit Hall is equivalent to five days outside."

"Such effects!"

Mo Qingyun showed surprise, then felt a yearning for the Spirit Hall.

If he could enter, his cultivation should advance faster.

"I must get first place in the clan competition!"

Mo Qingyun clenched his fist and made a silent decision.

"Are you eager to enter for cultivation?"

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s expression, Mo Yueyu and the others smiled at each other. Uncle Feilin said, "But don’t be too anxious; you can get first place this year. After all, your foundation is still shallow."

"Uncle Feilin’s right; Body Refinement Seventh Stage peak cultivation is only top thirty in the clan competition, far from first."

Uncle Feipeng added, "But don’t lose heart; with your current cultivation speed, you have a good chance of getting first place next year."

"Next year’s clan competition?"

Mo Qingyun pursed his lips and a faint smile appeared. "It seems Uncle Feipeng, Aunt Feiyu, and Fourth Uncle don’t have much confidence in me."

But Mo Qingyun did not argue; after all, what they said was true.

Body Refinement Seventh Stage competing for first place in the clan competition was impossible.

But he would not give up; his true cultivation level was more than just Body Refinement Seventh Stage peak.

Chapter 43: Do You Want to Do It Yourself or Shall I? (Third Update)

"Qing Yun, do you want to go with Xiao Xiao and me to the town? Will you come along?"

After leaving Uncle Feipeng’s residence, Mo Ling asked Mo Qingyun.

"Sure!"

Mo Qingyun chuckled and left the Mo family with the two girls, heading to North Desert Town.

About a quarter of an hour later, the three arrived in North Desert Town.

"Qing Yun, Xiao Xiao and I will go to the cosmetic shop in front; you can do your business first. When you’re done, come find us at the cosmetic shop."

Arriving in North Desert Town, Mo Ling pointed to a cosmetics shop and smiled.

"Okay!"

Looking at the cosmetics shop, Mo Qingyun nodded and turned to leave, heading towards Treasured Spirit Shop.

After these days of refining pills, the spiritual herbs and medicinal materials he had were not many.

He planned to go to Treasured Spirit Shop to see if he could find what he needed.

Arriving at Treasured Spirit Shop again, Mo Qingyun went straight to the second floor.

With his current cultivation level, the ordinary medicinal materials on the first floor were not much use to him.

The second floor of Treasured Spirit Shop was smaller than the first, with fewer people.

After reaching the second floor, various spiritual herbs caught Mo Qingyun’s eye.

But their prices made him feel a bit headache.

First-grade spiritual herbs were around five hundred gold coins per plant, second-grade ones fluctuated between two thousand.

As for third-grade spiritual herbs, each was in the range of eight to ten thousand gold coins.

Seeing these prices, Mo Qingyun couldn’t help but sigh and muttered, "These spiritual herbs are really expensive; I’m so poor."
