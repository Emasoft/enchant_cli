Black Xuan gave Mo Qingyun a brief instruction, then said, “But if you encounter a life-or-death situation, send me a telepathic message; I can intervene once for you.”

“Thank you!”

Hearing Black Xuan’s words, Mo Qingyun showed a look of gratitude and thanked him.

After hearing Mo Qingyun’s thanks, Black Xuan responded briefly before falling into a deep sleep and no longer spoke.

Then, his huge body emitted no more aura.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun hesitated no longer and used the help of the small palace to leave Black Xuan’s Hall.

Soon, Mo Qingyun arrived outside Black Xuan’s Hall.

Outside the hall, Mo Qingyun controlled the small palace to prepare to take Black Xuan’s Hall away.

Under Mo Qingyun’s control, the hall immediately began to shrink until it was only as big as a fingernail and entered Mo Qingyun’s body.

“Prince Eighth, quick…quick, look! Black Xuan Hall is gone!”

At this moment, when Mo Qingyun was taking away the Black Xuan Hall, Yan Er of Puppet Kingdom showed a look of shock and said to Yan Qiyang beside him.

“Damn Black Xuan, he really gave the Black Xuan Hall to that kid!”

Seeing this scene, Yan Qiyang showed a look of ferocity and gritted his teeth, saying, “Black Xuan, since you insist on opposing me, after I obtain that thing and refine it, I will definitely kill you.”

After uttering a cold word, Yan Qiyang, with a face full of gloominess, rushed towards the direction of Black Xuan Hall and said coldly, “Boy, my things are not so easy to take. This time I will make you die without a whole body.”

Soon, Yan Qiyang and others appeared in front of Mo Qingyun, each with a fierce look glaring at him as if they wanted to tear him apart.

“Yan Qiyang!”

Seeing Yan Qiyang and others in front of him, Mo Qingyun’s expression changed slightly, somewhat surprised by their appearance.

Chapter 242: Auction (Second Update)()

“Boy, last time you relied on some means to侥幸保住 your life.”

Looking at Mo Qingyun in front of him, Yan Qiyang said with a gloomy look and coldly, “But this time I won’t give you another chance. If you know what’s good for you, hand over the things you got from Black Xuan to me. Perhaps I might spare your life.”

“What are you babbling about, showing off your own incompetence?”

Hearing Yan Qiyang’s words, Mo Qingyun showed a hint of disdain and replied, “If you have the ability, just come over and fight. No need to talk so much nonsense.”

“Boy, you’re looking for death!”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Yan Qiyang immediately gritted his teeth and said a cold word, attacking Mo Qingyun.

At the same time, when Yan Qiyang attacked Mo Qingyun, his Puppet Kingdom companions also attacked him.

Seeing their actions, Mo Qingyun said a mocking word, “Worthless people rely on numbers.”

Soul Heaven Seal

After Mo Qingyun’s words, he summoned it.

This seal emitted a brilliant light and enveloped Mo Qingyun and his Dan Mansion realm avatar.

Pfft!

At the same time, after Yan Qiyang formed this seal, he immediately spat blood and his aura weakened to the extreme.

But he did not hesitate either; he turned around and continued to flee.

“Young Master, run!”

At this moment, after Yan Qiyang made a move, Jiu Gong’s tone changed and he reminded Mo Qingyun anxiously.

Teleportation Gate!

As Jiu Gong reminded, Mo Qingyun had already activated his martial soul technique and teleported into the teleportation gate.

The action was decisive, without any hesitation or dragging.

Whoosh!

Soon, Mo Qingyun left the area covered by that strange seal and arrived at a nearby place.

As Mo Qingyun left the strange seal area,

Ah… Awo…

Below the ground covered by that seal, black hands immediately appeared and grabbed the Dan Mansion realm avatar, tearing it apart.

Pfft!

Under these black hands’ tearing, soon the Dan Mansion realm avatar was torn into pieces and dragged underground.

With the Dan Mansion being torn apart, that strange seal gradually faded until it disappeared.

After the strange seal dissipated, those black hands under the ground also vanished in an instant.

Seeing this scene, Mo Qingyun felt a chill and showed a look of lingering fear.

He really did not expect that Yan Qiyang, besides the Dan Mansion Heaven Girdle, had such a means.

If he was dragged in just now, he would probably have the same fate as the Dan Mansion realm avatar.

This person is too dangerous.

“Yan Qiyang, next time when I meet you again, I will definitely kill you!”

Looking at Yan Qiyang’s direction of escape, Mo Qingyun said with a cold look and uttered an icy word.

After uttering a fierce word, Mo Qingyun showed a look of regret and looked at the Dan Mansion realm avatar torn into pieces, saying, “A pity, a Dan Mansion realm avatar was wasted like this.”

After sighing, Mo Qingyun did not think more and walked to Yan Er’s group of Puppet Kingdom, taking their乾坤bags and puppets away.

In this clash, he lost a Dan Mansion realm avatar; he had to take some interest back.

After doing all this, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and set off towards Four Symbols City.

Five days later.

Under Mo Qingyun’s frenzied journey, he arrived at a city called Star Workshop City and prepared to rest inside.

At this moment when Mo Qingyun arrived at Star Workshop City, he found many people rushing towards the city.

Seeing their hurried look, it seemed as if they were waiting for some treasure to be unearthed.

Seeing this scene, Mo Qingyun’s expression changed and a doubt rose in his heart. He thought to himself, “Could it be that some treasure appeared inside Star Workshop City?”

After this discovery, Mo Qingyun approached a person with curiosity and asked, “Friend, why are so many people coming to Star Workshop City?”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, the person showed a look of disdain and said to him, “You don’t even know this? Your information is too outdated.”

Hearing the person’s words, Mo Qingyun felt a bit embarrassed and continued to ask, “Please enlighten me!”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s continuous inquiries, the person no longer kept him in suspense and said excitedly, “I’ll tell you. In one day, there will be a huge auction in Star Workshop City. It’s said that this auction will have hundreds of treasures.”

“Auction?”

Hearing the person’s words, Mo Qingyun showed a look of surprise and was somewhat surprised by this answer.

“Of course, these people are just coming for the fun of it to see those treasures and don’t have the ability to compete for them.”

As Mo Qingyun was surprised, this person continued, “Also, I heard that the main item of this auction is a peculiar stone with symbols. It’s said that this stone contains terrifying power, and if used for refining weapons, it might create divine weapons.”

“A stone with symbols?”

Hearing this young man’s words, Mo Qingyun’s eyes lit up and he thought of something.

Then, Mo Qingyun asked Jiu Gong, “Jiu Gong, do you think this stone is the Star Pattern Array Stone?”

“Not sure!”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Jiu Gong said excitedly, “But there is a seventy percent chance that the stone is the Star Pattern Array Stone. Therefore, Young Master, you must participate in this auction.”

“Mm-hmm!”

Hearing Jiu Gong’s words, Mo Qingyun nodded and made a decision in his heart.

At this moment, while Mo Qingyun was talking with Jiu Gong, the young man showed a smile and said to Mo Qingyun, “Boy, your luck is really good. You stumbled into such a big event.”

“Haha!”

Hearing the young man’s words, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and threw a乾坤bag to him with a smile, saying, “Thank you for your enlightenment. This is my gratitude.”

After throwing the乾坤bag to him, Mo Qingyun turned around and walked into Star Workshop City.

“Hey! Boy, what do you think of me? I’m not doing this for your gratitude!”

Seeing the乾坤bag Mo Qingyun threw to him, Ma Liang’s expression changed and he shouted at Mo Qingyun with a serious look.

But seeing that Mo Qingyun did not respond, Ma Liang curiously opened the乾坤bag and muttered to himself, “A silly boy like you, what could he give me…”

But when Ma Liang saw the contents of the乾坤bag, his expression froze and he almost couldn’t believe his eyes.

The乾坤bag contained hundreds of thousands of元Spirit Stones.

This was comparable to all his wealth!

“Just a few words and you gave me hundreds of thousands of元Spirit Stones. Is there such a good thing?”

At this moment, Ma Liang’s heart raced and he said excitedly to Mo Qingyun’s back, “Brother, I was just talking casually. Your gratitude is accepted.”

After responding to Mo Qingyun, Ma Liang’s expression changed and he said, “By the way, did that boy take the wrong乾坤bag? Did he give me his own wealth and leave his gratitude bag on him…”

This thought appeared, Ma Liang’s expression changed and he said to himself, “It must be like this. While that boy still knows, I’ll slip away first and earn hundreds of thousands of元Spirit Stones for free. It’s really great.”

Then, Ma Liang quickly fled the scene, afraid that Mo Qingyun would come back for him.

But if he knew that Mo Qingyun now had over a hundred billion元Spirit Stones, what would his expression be like?

Perhaps it would be even more interesting.

Chapter 243: No Money, Go to the Side (Second Update)()

After entering Star Workshop City, Mo Qingyun found a hotel and booked an upper-class room to stay in.

Entering the room, Mo Qingyun began his cultivation, waiting for tomorrow’s auction to start.

However, while he was cultivating, he released a thread of soul force to sense the conversations in the hotel.

“Did you hear? It’s said that many people from the Ten Great Kingdoms will come to this auction.”

“I heard it early. They are passing through Four Symbols City and coming here for fun.”

“Four Symbols City? Is that the city where Purple Pupil Demon Lord appeared? Are the Ten Great Kingdoms going to deal with Purple Pupil Demon Lord?”

“You’re out of date. The Ten Great Kingdoms have already issued a hundred-nation wanted order, chasing Purple Pupil Demon Lord and his companions.”

“I know that the people from the Ten Great Kingdoms are going to Four Symbols City to deal with Purple Pupil Demon Lord’s four friends.”

“You guys’ information is wrong. Purple Pupil Demon Lord’s subordinates have all been captured, and the Ten Great Kingdoms are killing one of his subordinates every day to force him out.”

“Now I understand. The Ten Great Kingdoms’ move is ruthless. If Purple Pupil Demon Lord doesn’t appear, he will be considered unrighteous.”

…

At this moment, everyone’s conversation reached Mo Qingyun’s ears word by word.

“Now I understand!”

Hearing the conversations, Mo Qingyun’s expression changed and showed a look of understanding.

Now he finally understood why every day, one Soul Capture Mark lost contact recently.

After this discovery, Mo Qingyun frowned and thought to himself, “Since the people from the Ten Great Kingdoms are dealing with Brother Lu’s group, they should be safe for now as long as the people from the Ten Great Kingdoms are still in Star Workshop City.”

Thinking this, Mo Qingyun’s expression relaxed slightly. But soon his face showed a look of doubt.

“There is an array I set up outside Brother Ling Luo’s cultivation room. They should be safe.”

Mo Qingyun showed a puzzled look and guessed, “Could it be that someone from the Ten Great Kingdoms is skilled in arrays? It must be like this…”

One day passed quickly.

Seeing the auction time, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and left his room to head for the auction house.

The auction house was not far from Mo Qingyun’s hotel, and soon he arrived at the auction.

Seeing Mo Qingyun enter the auction house, a receptionist came to him and asked, “Sir, are you here for auction items or bidding?”

“Bidding!” Mo Qingyun replied calmly.

“Sir, do you need a regular seat or a VIP room?” the receptionist asked again.

Hearing this, Mo Qingyun showed a look of confusion and asked, “What’s the difference?”

“A regular seat costs one hundred thousand元Spirit Stones. A VIP room costs one million yuan spirit stones,” the receptionist explained.

Hearing the explanation, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and threw a乾坤bag to her, saying, “Arrange me a VIP room.”

Then, Mo Qingyun was led by the receptionist to a VIP Room No. 8.

VIP Room No. 8 was in a good position, located on the third floor of the auction venue, from where he could see the entire scene clearly.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun showed a faint smile and said, “Money is good. This million yuan spirit stones are worth it.”

“Young Master, one million yuan spirit stones is a considerable wealth for ordinary True Essence Realm martial artists. They wouldn’t spend this money.”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Jiu Gong smiled faintly and replied to him.

After hearing Jiu Gong’s words, Mo Qingyun nodded with a smile, agreeing with Jiu Gong’s viewpoint.

Back in North Desert Town, as one of the three major families in Mo Family, they didn’t even have ten thousand yuan spirit stones.

Therefore, one million yuan spirit stones was indeed a considerable amount of money.

At this moment while Mo Qingyun and Jiu Gong were talking, the auction had already started.

Soon, various items were taken out by the auctioneer for bidding.

“This item is a treasure armor. It’s said that even divine weapons can’t pierce it. Starting price: one million yuan spirit stones!”

At this moment, the auctioneer took out a soft armor and introduced it to everyone.

After the auctioneer’s words, someone immediately bid.

“I’ll offer one million ten thousand!”

“Adding one hundred thousand is worth it. I’ll offer one million eleven thousand!”

“I’ll offer one million thirty thousand!”

…

Bidding voices rose and fell.

In the end, this treasure armor was sold for three million two hundred thousand yuan spirit stones.

The sale of the treasure armor immediately pushed the auction atmosphere to a higher level.

Next, the auctioneer took out several items for bidding one after another.

These items were all sold for hundreds of thousands of yuan spirit stones, and the auction atmosphere reached its peak after these items were sold.

After one item was auctioned off, the auctioneer took out three more items.

These three items were each several meters long and as thick as fingers, completely black, looking somewhat like three whips.

“The items we are auctioning this time are similar to dragon tendons.”

The auctioneer took the three black whip-like items and introduced them on the auction stage, saying, “Regarding their origin, we are not sure. But one thing is certain: these items are extraordinary. We tried to cut them with divine weapons, but they remained intact…”

At this moment, the auctioneer introduced them tirelessly as if these three black whips were priceless treasures.

“Stop talking and just give the price!”

Hearing the auctioneer’s continuous introduction, everyone became impatient and urged him.

“Haha, if that’s the case, I won’t say much.”

Seeing everyone was impatient, the auctioneer tactfully stopped talking and said with a smile, “Since these three items are being auctioned together, the starting price might be high. The starting price is one million yuan spirit stones, and each bid must not be less than ten thousand yuan spirit stones.”

“Damn! Not knowing what they are, you start at one million yuan spirit stones. Are you going to rob us?”

“Yes, you’re too greedy. I won’t spend this money.”

“If it were one million yuan spirit stones, maybe I would bid. One million is too expensive.”

…

After the auctioneer’s words, there were immediate complaints.

But the auctioneer paid no attention to this as if it was a common occurrence.

Thump thump!

At this moment, when the auctioneer introduced these three black whip-like items, Mo Qingyun’s eyes lit up rapidly.

“These are…”

Feeling the movement of his eyes, Mo Qingyun showed a look of surprise and exclaimed excitedly, “These are the mysterious eyelashes. I didn’t expect to encounter them again.”

Mo Qingyun was very clear about the effect of these mysterious eyelashes; they could strengthen his bloodline.

“These three eyelashes must be mine!”

At this moment, Mo Qingyun clenched his fists and made a decision in his heart. He immediately said, “One million one hundred thousand yuan spirit stones.”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s bid, the auctioneer’s eyes lit up and he said excitedly, “Room No. 8 VIP has offered one million one hundred thousand yuan spirit stones. Is there a higher bid?”

A one-hundred-thousand-yuan-spirit-stones increase, this was a big customer. Now it seemed that these three black whips would fetch a good price.

“I’ll offer one million one hundred twenty thousand yuan spirit stones!” The auctioneer’s words had barely fallen when someone bid.

“I’ll offer one million two hundred thousand yuan spirit stones.”

“I’ll offer one million two hundred fifty thousand yuan spirit stones!”

…

Various bidding voices rang out.

“Haha, just over one million yuan spirit stones. Buying three collectibles is not bad.”

At this moment when everyone was bidding, in Room No. 3 VIP, someone said with a faint smile and bid, “I’ll offer one million five hundred thousand yuan spirit stones!”

After this person’s bid, he looked at the crowd and said, “Everyone, I’m Fan Xian from Knife Kingdom. I plan to buy a few collectibles. Please give me some face.”

With his words, the auction venue immediately stirred up, everyone whispering.

“Fan Xian? He’s actually from Knife Kingdom. I didn’t expect him to come to the Hundred Nations Battlefield.”

“I heard that Fan Xian is one of the three geniuses in Knife Kingdom. He can directly participate in the Great Dynasty Exam.”

“Knife Kingdom ranks third among the Ten Great Kingdoms. Fan Xian is ranked in the top three in talent in Knife Kingdom. His future achievements are boundless.”

“We can’t afford to offend Fan Xian, so let’s not compete with him and avoid provoking a terrifying enemy.”

“Alright, it’s not worth offending Fan Xian for an unknown item.”

…

After knowing Fan Xian’s identity, everyone in the auction venue gave up competing and prepared to let him have these items.

Seeing this scene, the auctioneer’s expression changed slightly and showed a look of anxiety.

He had hoped that this item would liven up the atmosphere, but Fan Xian’s appearance caused a cold scene in the auction process.

But although he was anxious, he did not dare to show his dissatisfaction.

There was nothing he could do; Fan Xian’s identity was something he couldn’t offend. No matter how much dissatisfaction he had, now he could only endure it.

After a brief moment of anxiety, the auctioneer said, “Room No. 3 VIP has offered one million five hundred thousand yuan spirit stones. Is there a higher bid? If not, these three treasures will belong to him.”

After the auctioneer’s words, he showed an expectant look, hoping someone would save the scene.

“I’ll offer two million yuan spirit stones!”

At this moment when the auctioneer was eagerly waiting, a voice came from Room No. 8 VIP.

Hearing Room No. 8’s bid, the auctioneer immediately showed a look of surprise, meaning that he was very close to him.

When Mo Qingyun bid, the surrounding people’s expressions changed slightly and were somewhat shocked by his actions.

They did not expect that after Fan Xian introduced himself, someone would dare to bid again.

This was challenging Fan Xian!

“Who is this in Room No. 8? Knowing Fan Xian’s identity, he still dares to bid again. Is this challenging Fan Xian?”

“Should be someone from the Ten Great Kingdoms, otherwise who would dare to compete with Fan Xian in this Hundred Nations Battlefield?”

“No matter what, he can afford a million yuan spirit stones for a VIP room. We can’t compare with him.”

“It’s true, but I still think that he offended Fan Xian and it seems a bit unwise.”

…

Everyone had their own opinions, arguing with each other.

“What boldness! Daring to compete for something with me!”

Seeing Mo Qingyun bid again, Fan Xian’s expression darkened and he looked at Room No. 8 coldly, saying, “Sir, are you challenging me? Have you considered the consequences of your actions?”

“Threatening me?”

Hearing Fan Xian’s words, Mo Qingyun replied disdainfully and said contemptuously, “If you don’t have money, go to the side. Don’t embarrass yourself here.”

After Mo Qingyun’s words, everyone in the auction venue was shocked.

The person in Room No. 8 is challenging Fan Xian!

Chapter 244: Not Coming Is Being a Coward (Second Update)()

“Wow, so domineering. Even someone from the Ten Great Kingdoms wouldn’t dare to talk to Fan Xian like this.”

“Who is this guy? Daring to challenge Fan Xian like this. Doesn’t he fear death?”

“Looks like there’s a show to watch. I hope that when this guy meets Fan Xian, he can still be so domineering.”

…

After hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, the auction venue was stirred up and everyone showed a look of excitement.

Challenging a genius from the Ten Great Kingdoms, such an event is not easy to see.

“Brother Fan Xian, it seems your face isn’t big enough!”

At this moment, someone from Room No. 2 VIP said with a soft tone.

“Brother Fan Xian, if you don’t have enough money, I can lend you some.”

Someone from Room No. 9 VIP said with a faint smile.

Then, the people in other VIP rooms also teased Fan Xian one after another.

As geniuses from the Ten Great Kingdoms, they were very happy to see others being challenged and ignored.

Hearing everyone’s words, Fan Xian’s expression darkened to the extreme.

He knew very well that if he didn’t deal with the person in Room No. 8, this time he would lose face.

Then, Fan Xian looked at Room No. 8 with a dark expression and said coldly, “Boy, if you don’t want to die, come in front of me now and kneel down to admit your mistake. Bark three times like a dog.”

Hearing Fan Xian’s words, Mo Qingyun showed a look of disdain and replied, “If you don’t have money, go away immediately. Don’t hinder me from bidding.”

“Boy, you’re looking for death!”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Fan Xian was so angry that his expression twitched and he said a fierce word, “Boy, if you have guts, stay after the auction ends. I’ll slowly deal with you.”

“I’m waiting for you. Not coming is being a coward!”

Facing Fan Xian’s threat, Mo Qingyun was not bothered and replied with defiance, “Not coming is being a coward!”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, everyone in the auction venue changed their expressions again and were somewhat shocked by his words.

Just now Mo Qingyun was provoking, now it’s a challenge!

Challenging Fan Xian, this is too domineering!

Thinking of this, everyone’s hearts were excited. There was really a show to watch.

“Hmph!”

After hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Fan Xian did not say more and said coldly before bidding, “Two million one hundred thousand yuan spirit stones!”

Fan Xian knew that if he argued verbally, he was no match for Mo Qingyun. Continuing to talk would only make him lose face.

“Room No. 3 VIP has offered two million one hundred thousand yuan spirit stones. Is there a higher bid?”

Seeing Mo Qingyun and Fan Xian bidding, the auctioneer showed an excited look. They loved such situations.

“Only one hundred thousand yuan spirit stones more, so poor!”

Hearing Fan Xian’s bid, Mo Qingyun said with a mocking tone and bid, “If you’re a man, come in for ten million. I’ll offer three million yuan spirit stones!”

If you’re a man, come in for ten million!

After Mo Qingyun’s words, Fan Xian’s expression darkened and he hesitated a bit.

Originally, he just planned to spend over one million yuan spirit stones on some collectibles. Now it seemed that several millions might not be enough.

More importantly, his target was the main item. He didn’t want to spend too much here.

Thinking this, Fan Xian decided not to continue bidding and said coldly, “Boy, spending three million yuan spirit stones on unknown items is wasteful.”

Hearing Fan Xian’s words, everyone nodded in agreement.

Three million yuan spirit stones is not three thousand yuan spirit stones. If he bought something useless, it would be a huge loss.

But when everyone nodded in agreement with Fan Xian’s words, Mo Qingyun showed a look of disdain and replied, “My money is plenty. What’s it to you? If you’re a man, throw in four million yuan spirit stones.”

“Boy, don’t be too proud!”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Fan Xian was so angry that he spat blood. If he didn’t bid again, he wouldn’t be a man.

At this moment, he absolutely couldn’t back down.

“Four million!” Fan Xian gritted his teeth and said.

“Five million!”

As soon as Fan Xian’s words fell, Mo Qingyun bid again without hesitation and added another million yuan spirit stones.

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s action, Fan Xian’s expression changed and he considered whether to bid again.

If he bid again, it would be six million yuan spirit stones. This was not a small amount.

If he didn’t bid, then he would lose face in front of Mo Qingyun.

After a moment’s consideration, Fan Xian decided to give up. It wasn’t the time for pride; he couldn’t lose the bigger picture.

“My target is the main item. I can’t let this ruin my plans.”

Fan Xian comforted himself and his expression eased a bit. He said coldly, “Hmph! Wait until I bid again and then you’ll retreat. Don’t fall into my trap.”

“Afraid? Give yourself an excuse, that’s the action of a weakling.”

Hearing Fan Xian’s words, Mo Qingyun replied without yielding and said with a strong sense of ridicule.

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Fan Xian stood up from his chair and looked at Room No. 8 with a glare, saying, “Boy, if you have guts, compete for the main item!”

“Hey! Scaring me?”

Mo Qingyun smiled disdainfully and replied, “I hope you can fight like a man when we compete for the main item. Don’t be soft like now, if one million yuan spirit stones is a centimeter, your thing only has three centimeters. Too short!”

Three centimeters! Too short!

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, everyone in the auction venue showed strange expressions and held back their laughter.

“This person in Room No. 8 is so annoying, saying such embarrassing words!”

“But I like it. If he can say this, he must be very domineering.”

“Hehe, if he’s handsome, I’ll let him have free rein just for this sentence.”

…

Some women in the auction venue blushed and said various things.

“Haha, this brother is so genuine. He’s to my taste. I’m Huo from Beast Kingdom, would you like to be friends?”

At this moment, someone from Room No. 9 VIP said with a friendly tone.

“I’m Fan Fang from Giant Kingdom, I also want to be friends!”

Someone from Room No. 10 VIP said with a loud voice.

Hearing the words of those in Rooms No. 9 and No. 10 VIP, everyone’s expressions changed again and showed looks of shock and envy.

“This boy can get the favor of people from the Ten Great Kingdoms. He’s really lucky.”

“Yes, with Beast Valley and Giant Kingdom’s help, he should be able to survive.”

“This boy’s actions were probably to attract the attention of people from the Ten Great Kingdoms. This move is quite clever.”

…

Everyone in the auction venue talked about their thoughts.

But was Mo Qingyun really thinking this way?

“Want to be friends?”

Hearing their words, Mo Qingyun showed a playful smile but did not immediately respond to them.

In Mo Qingyun’s view, if they knew his identity, would they still say this?

“Huo and Fan Fang, are you afraid of offending Fan Xian by being friends with him?”

After a moment’s silence, seeing Mo Qingyun did not respond to them, someone from Room No. 2 VIP said with a cold tone and added, “Also, it seems he’s not willing to be friends with you!”

Hearing the words of those in Room No. 2 VIP, Mo Qingyun showed a look of coldness and replied, “Don’t worry. Whether I befriend someone or not, I won’t be friends with you this odd person. Your voice is neither male nor female; maybe your lower body hasn’t developed well.”

Lower body not developed?

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, everyone changed their expressions again and held back a laugh.

But they couldn’t help it.

Those in Room No. 2 VIP were even more terrifying than those in Room No. 3, they were from the second-ranked Corpse Kingdom among the Ten Great Kingdoms.

These people of Corpse Kingdom were always with corpses, each and every one was gloomy and ruthless. They couldn’t be easily offended.

After responding to those in Room No. 2 VIP, Mo Qingyun urged the auctioneer, “Don’t stand there, if no one bids again, announce the result quickly.”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, the auctioneer did not hesitate and asked around.

Seeing no one bid again, the auctioneer announced the result. The three mysterious eyelashes were won by Mo Qingyun.

In the end, Mo Qingyun won these three mysterious eyelashes for five million yuan spirit stones.

Seeing this result, Mo Qingyun showed a faint smile. Five million yuan spirit stones for these three eyelashes was really profitable.

After Mo Qingyun won the three mysterious eyelashes, the auctioneer took out another item for auction.

This was a long sword, a sub-grade divine weapon.

Mo Qingyun had no interest in it and did not participate in the bidding.

For some time, Mo Qingyun did not bid on any items. The people from the Ten Great Kingdoms bid on some items during this time.

Seeing Mo Qingyun did not bid for a while, Fan Xian said disdainfully, “I thought he was so domineering. He’s just big in talk. After bidding one item, he became timid. Weak!”

Hearing Fan Xian’s words, Mo Qingyun was surprised for a moment and then replied disdainfully, “Just some scrap. I don’t even look at them. You treat them as treasures and still dare to compete with me for the main item?”

At this moment, while Mo Qingyun and Fan Xian were mocking each other,
