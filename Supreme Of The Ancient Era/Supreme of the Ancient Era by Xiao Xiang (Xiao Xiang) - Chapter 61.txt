Upon hearing the reminders from everyone, Long Yutian's expression turned serious, and without any hesitation, he immediately summoned the Crystal Thousand钧Shield.

The moment Long Yutian summoned the Crystal Thousand钧Shield, it emitted a dazzling light, forming a radiant barrier that blocked Bai Xiang's sword光芒.

Bang!

The sword光芒 struck the light barrier, immediately producing a muffled sound and intensifying the radiance, making it impossible for others to look directly at it.

Step by step...

At the same time, after blocking Bai Xiang's sword, Long Yutian was pushed back continuously.

It wasn't until he retreated ten meters that Long Yutian slowly stopped, his face slightly flushed and his blood surging.

From this, it could be seen that Long Yutian wasn't very comfortable in blocking Bai Xiang's sword.

However, with his True Essence Realm Fifth Level cultivation, Long Yutian was still proud of being able to withstand Bai Xiang's full-power attack at True Essence Realm Ninth Level.

That kid blocked Bai Xiang’s sword!

Seeing this, the surrounding people's expressions changed, showing surprise and looking at Long Yutian with new respect.

Although Long Yutian looked somewhat disheveled now, no one looked down on him. Instead, everyone admired his achievement.

To be able to withstand a full-power attack from someone four realms higher and remain unscathed was not something many could do.

Seeing Long Yutian's flushed face, Lü Fangliang and the others showed concern and walked over to ask, "Brother Long, are you alright?"

"Dead can't die!"

Long Yutian took a deep breath and smiled brightly, reassuring everyone that they didn’t need to worry.

Seeing Long Yutian's expression, Lü Fangliang and the others relaxed slightly.

After responding to Lü Fangliang and the others, Long Yutian looked haughty and confronted Bai Xiang, disdainfully saying, "True Essence Realm Ninth Level? So what!"

True Essence Realm Ninth Level? So what!

As soon as Long Yutian spoke, the surrounding people's expressions changed again, somewhat surprised by his actions.

He was directly challenging Bai Xiang!

Hearing Long Yutian's words, Bai Xiang’s expression darkened, a sense of humiliation rising in his heart.

With his True Essence Realm Ninth Level cultivation, he had fully attacked a person at the True Essence Realm level, and not only did the other party remain unscathed but also challenged him verbally.

This was a great humiliation for him.

Thinking this way, Bai Xiang’s eyes turned cold as he looked at Long Yutian and said coldly, "I didn’t kill you with one sword just now; it was your luck. Since you’re looking for death, I’ll fulfill your wish."

As soon as Bai Xiang spoke, he moved and attacked Long Yutian again, his actions more fierce than before.

"You’re too arrogant. In front of me, you don’t have the right to be so haughty."

At this moment, Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened slightly as he issued a cold remark and charged at Bai Xiang like an eagle.

Fierce Bird Piercing the Sky

As Mo Qingyun moved, he turned into a streak of light, his body surrounded by raging wind blades. In just a few flashes, he arrived beside Bai Xiang.

As Mo Qingyun charged at Bai Xiang, he didn’t forget to instruct Lü Fangliang and the others, "Brother Lu, take Brother Long aside for a moment to let him recover his internal energy."

Mo Qingyun knew clearly that although Long Yutian had withstood Bai Xiang’s sword strike without being injured, his internal energy was still shocked and needed to be recovered.

"Alright!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Lü Fangliang nodded immediately and understood his intentions.

Then, without hesitation, Lü Fangliang supported Long Yutian to one side for recovery while also reminding Mo Qingyun, "Brother Mo, you should be careful too."

Seeing Mo Qingyun charging at him, Bai Xiang’s expression darkened, looking somewhat fierce.

At this moment, his anger reached its peak, like a volcano erupting.

He couldn’t accept that a Fifth Level True Essence Realm youth had challenged him just now.

In an instant, another Third Level True Essence Realm youth was attacking him. This was a great humiliation for him.

He, Bai Xiang, a Ninth Level True Essence Realm expert from the Sword Kingdom among the Ten Great Kingdoms, was being looked down upon one after another.

He couldn’t accept this.

"You ignorant fool!"

Bai Xiang’s expression turned cold, his eyes flashing with a fierce light as he said, "Boy, since you’re eager to die, I’ll kill you first and then them."

Meteor Slash

As soon as Bai Xiang spoke, he slashed at Mo Qingyun with a sword, the action swift like a meteor.

Following this, a sword光芒 like a mad snake bursting from its den surged towards Mo Qingyun with unstoppable force.

Dragon Seal

Seeing the rapidly approaching sword光芒, Mo Qingyun didn’t hesitate and raised his hand to summon the Dragon Seal.

In no time, forty-nine Dragon Seals appeared in front of Mo Qingyun, forming a flame shield to resist the meteor sword光芒.

Bang!

The sword光芒 struck the flame shield, producing a shocking sound as energy raged wildly.

At the same time, cracks began to appear on the flame shield, as if it was about to be shattered.

Seeing this, Bai Xiang sneered and said coldly, "Boy, with your current abilities, you can’t withstand my sword."

"Is that so?"

Hearing Bai Xiang’s words, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and raised his hand to summon another thirty-four Dragon Seals.

As these thirty-four Dragon Seals were summoned, they quickly merged into the flame shield, reinforcing it.

With these thirty-four Dragon Seals added, the originally cracked flame shield slowly healed and its aura became stronger.

"Suppress it for me!"

After blocking Bai Xiang’s sword, Mo Qingyun didn’t hesitate and controlled the flame shield to suppress the sword光芒.

At this moment, under Mo Qingyun’s control, the flame shield shone brightly, bursting with fierce flames as if to burn everything.

Divine Power!

The flame shield now emitted a divine power, not just one level but three levels.

"Three… Three Levels of Divine Power!"

Feeling the powerful divine power in the flame shield, Bai Xiang’s expression twitched, a sense of fear rising as he exclaimed, "How… How is this possible? This boy could comprehend three levels of fire divine power…"

Bai Xiang knew clearly that with Mo Qingyun’s three-level divine power assistance, the gap in their cultivation levels had been narrowed significantly.

Moreover, Mo Qingyun’s martial soul level was much higher than his. Therefore, killing Mo Qingyun would be difficult.

Meteor Slash

Seeing this, Bai Xiang didn’t hesitate and swung his sword fiercely at the flame shield.

Following this, dazzling sword光芒 burst from Bai Xiang’s sword and struck the flame shield fiercely.

Bang bang bang…

Facing Bai Xiang’s fierce attacks, the flame shield emitted dazzling light like fireworks, radiating brightly.

After a moment, under Bai Xiang’s fierce attacks, the flame shield finally couldn’t withstand it and was shattered by his strikes.

Boom!

As soon as the flame shield was shattered, a mushroom-shaped cloud of fire appeared, releasing a storm of energy that swept fiercely in all directions.

Under this energy storm, the entire sky turned red. Those nearby could clearly feel their skin burning from the heat.

After breaking through the flame shield, Bai Xiang’s expression darkened and he said coldly to Mo Qingyun, "Boy, even if you have high comprehension of divine power, in the face of a significant cultivation gap, you will still die."

"Is that so?"

Hearing Bai Xiang’s words, Mo Qingyun smirked and said disdainfully, "You’re too early to be happy. Don’t forget that I haven’t even started my attack yet."

Sunfire Mountain-Splitting Saber

As soon as Mo Qingyun spoke, he no longer wasted words and slashed at Bai Xiang with his Fire Silk Saber.

As Mo Qingyun’s saber fell, the Fire Silk Saber emitted a bright light, bursting with dragon-like saber光芒 that devoured Bai Xiang.

At this moment, under the divine power’s enhancement, this saber光芒 was almost like a real dragon, exuding powerful aura that made people involuntarily change their expressions.

"Good… Good strong attack!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s saber approaching, Bai Xiang’s expression changed, feeling an inability to resist.

"Not good. This boy’s attack, enhanced by divine power, has increased several times in strength. His saber can now threaten Brother Bai Xiang."

Seeing this, Eagle Peak’s expression changed and he charged at Mo Qingyun without hesitation.

Eagle Peak said to Bai Xiang, "Brother Bai Xiang, I’ll assist you. Let’s join forces to kill this boy."

"Alright!"

Seeing Eagle Peak attack, Bai Xiang’s expression brightened slightly and he slashed his sword to block Mo Qingyun’s attack.

Eagle Piercing the Sky

As Bai Xiang attacked, Eagle Peak didn’t hesitate and also launched his attack.

Eagle Peak charged down from the sky like a fierce eagle, swooping towards Mo Qingyun on the ground.

"Finally can’t hold back and attack?"

Seeing Eagle Peak attacking him, Mo Qingyun showed a look of disdain and said sarcastically.

Chapter 221: Even If You Attack, It Won’t Work (Second Update)

Dragon Seal

As soon as Mo Qingyun spoke, he raised his hand to summon the Dragon Seal and formed a flame shield to confront Eagle Peak.

After blocking Eagle Peak’s attack, Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened and he said arrogantly to Eagle Peak, "I’ll kill him. Even if you attack, it won’t work!"

"Slash for me!"

As Mo Qingyun spoke, he slashed at Bai Xiang again, releasing a saber光芒 even stronger than before.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun seemed to merge with the sky and earth, making people involuntarily look up in awe.

Saber Aura!

Mo Qingyun’s saber contained a saber aura, making it seem to merge with the sky and earth.

"Saber… Saber Aura!"

Seeing the saber光芒 approaching rapidly, as if it could cut through the sky, Bai Xiang’s expression twitched.

At this moment, he regretted not listening to Ling Luo and killing Lei Hao forcefully. If he had done so, he would have stood on Mo Qingyun’s side and wouldn’t be in this predicament.

However, Bai Xiang knew clearly that he had no chance to regret now.

Silver Horn Golden Flame Beast, appear!

Immediately, Bai Xiang summoned his martial soul without hesitation.

Under Bai Xiang’s summoning, a shadow of a beast with a silver horn and golden scales appeared above his head.

Three Absolute Annihilation!

After summoning his martial soul, Bai Xiang didn’t hesitate and directly used his martial soul technique to attack Mo Qingyun.

At this moment, Bai Xiang slashed three times in succession.

To Mo Qingyun’s surprise, after Bai Xiang used his martial soul technique, there was a hint of divine power in his three sword strikes.

However, it was just a hint and not true divine power.

Soon, the three sword光芒 collided with Mo Qingyun’s saber光芒.

Puchi!

In an instant, the three sword光芒 were shattered by Mo Qingyun’s saber光芒 and dissipated into the sky.

Not only that, but after shattering the sword光芒, Mo Qingyun’s saber光芒 continued to slash fiercely at Bai Xiang.

Bang!

Then everyone saw Bai Xiang struck by the saber光芒 and was sent flying.

Puchi!

After landing, Bai Xiang spat blood, his face pale, and his clothes torn. He looked extremely disheveled.

Seeing Bai Xiang’s miserable state, Eagle Peak’s expression twitched and he showed a look of fear.

His strength was similar to Bai Xiang’s, but under Mo Qingyun’s attack, he had been seriously injured.

This meant that if it were him earlier, he would have suffered the same fate as Bai Xiang.

Thinking this way, Eagle Peak didn’t hesitate and summoned his martial soul.

Thunder Lion, appear!

Under Eagle Peak’s summoning, a huge golden lion shadow appeared above his body.

Holy Elephant Treading the Sky!

After summoning his martial soul, Eagle Peak didn’t pause and directly used his martial soul technique.

As soon as Eagle Peak’s martial soul technique was activated, the sky darkened and a huge shadow covered it.

Roar!

The moment this huge shadow appeared, it exuded fierce aura and roared, shaking the earth.

Then everyone saw this huge shadow descend like a mountain pressing down on Mo Qingyun.

This huge shadow moved swiftly, and in an instant, Mo Qingyun was under its foot.

Bang!

As the huge shadow stepped on Mo Qingyun, it produced a loud sound, shaking the earth and causing the ground to tremble violently.

At the same time, a powerful energy wave spread rapidly in all directions from this huge shadow’s step.

Soon after the energy wave dissipated, everyone saw a large crater where Mo Qingyun had stood. Inside the crater, there was no sign of Mo Qingyun; he seemed to have been crushed into ashes.

"Brother Mo, is… he…"

Seeing this, Long Yutian and the others’ expressions tightened with concern.

Could Mo Qingyun have been crushed to death by Eagle Peak’s attack?

As Long Yutian and the others worried, people from various kingdoms began to whisper.

"Do you think this boy can still be alive?"

"I don’t think so. Didn’t you see that there’s nothing left in the crater?"

"How could he still be alive? Just a moment ago, that terrifying step would have crushed even iron."

...

People from various kingdoms shook their heads, believing Mo Qingyun was dead.

Seeing Mo Qingyun crushed into ashes by his martial soul technique, Eagle Peak’s expression relaxed slightly and he thought Mo Qingyun was dead.

In his view, although Mo Qingyun had a high comprehension and powerful aura, with limited cultivation, he couldn’t withstand this attack.

Thinking this way, Eagle Peak’s expression darkened and he instructed his companions, "Eagle Star, go and deal with those people. Kill all of them except Ling Luo."

Knowing Ling Luo’s identity, Eagle Peak didn’t dare to kill him. With nearly a hundred kingdoms present, if he killed the Sword Kingdom’s genius, it would soon be known in the Sword Kingdom.

Then, if the Sword Kingdom retaliated, even as a prince of the Eagle Kingdom, he couldn’t bear such consequences.

"Yes!"

Hearing Eagle Peak’s instructions, Eagle Star and the others nodded with a cold smile and slowly approached Long Yutian and the others.

"Lu Fangliang, didn’t you expect this? In the end, you can’t escape death!"

Ma Jue showed a cold smile and looked at Long Yutian, saying coldly, "Long Yutian, it’s all your fault for finding Mo Qingyun. Now I’ll settle the score with you."

Bang!

As Ma Jue and others were about to attack, a loud sound suddenly erupted from the crater.

Then everyone saw a figure fly out of the crater. It was Mo Qingyun!

Mo Qingyun, who had been hit by Eagle Peak’s martial soul technique, was unscathed.

Seeing this, everyone’s expressions changed with disbelief.

"Am I seeing things? That boy isn’t dead?"

"He doesn’t seem to have been injured. How did he withstand Eagle Peak’s martial soul technique?"

"What kind of monster is this boy? He can’t be killed even like this. It’s too incredible."

"I think he might still be alive, but after withstanding Eagle Peak’s martial soul technique, he must be at the end."

...

Everyone’s expressions changed with exclamations.

"Brother Mo… He’s still alive!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun fly out of the crater, Lu Fangliang and the others’ expressions changed with surprise.

Compared to their joy, Eagle Peak’s expression darkened.

Seeing Mo Qingyun unscathed, Eagle Peak’s expression twitched with disbelief and he said in shock, "You… You’re not dead?"

"Dead?"

Hearing Eagle Peak’s words, Mo Qingyun smirked and said indifferently, "You overestimate yourself. With your elephant foot, you couldn’t kill me."

"Since you’re out of tricks, I’ll send you to join Bai Xiang."

After responding to Eagle Peak, Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened and he attacked him.

Then Mo Qingyun slashed at Eagle Peak, exuding a powerful saber aura that maximized the power of his attack.

Eagle Piercing the Sky

Seeing Mo Qingyun charging at him, Eagle Peak didn’t hesitate and leaped up to dodge swiftly.

Seeing Bai Xiang seriously injured by Mo Qingyun’s saber, Eagle Peak didn’t dare to meet it head-on.

He didn’t think his strength was much greater than Bai Xiang’s.

Seeing Mo Qingyun attacking Eagle Peak, Ma Jue and the others’ expressions twitched with intense panic.

They knew that what they did to Mo Qingyun would mean their deaths if Eagle Peak was killed.

"What should we do? We need to come up with a plan before Eagle Peak is defeated. Otherwise, once he’s defeated, we’re doomed."

Ma Jue and the others’ eyes flickered as they thought of a plan. Then, seeing Long Yutian and the others, their eyes lit up.

They had a plan!

Immediately, Ma Jue’s eyes turned and he said coldly to Eagle Star, "Eagle Star, these boys are Mo Qingyun’s companions. If we capture them, we can use them to force Mo Qingyun into submission."

Hearing Ma Jue’s words, Eagle Star’s eyes lit up and he said approvingly, "Your suggestion is good. After we deal with this matter, I’ll have my brother the prince reward you."

"Thank you, Eagle Star!"

Hearing Eagle Star’s words, Ma Jue and the others showed a pleased expression and responded respectfully.

"We’ll move now and capture these people!"

After praising Ma Jue, Eagle Star and the others charged at Long Yutian and the others with ruthless actions.

Under their fierce attacks, although Long Yutian and the others formed a battle array, they soon fell into a passive state.

After all, Eagle Star and the others’ cultivation levels were at True Essence Realm Seventh Level, and their numbers far exceeded Long Yutian’s.

With Long Yutian and the others’ cultivation levels, not being completely crushed was already a good achievement.

Seeing Long Yutian and the others fall into a passive state under Eagle Star’s attacks, Ma Jue and the others showed smug smiles.

Then Ma Jue looked at Mo Qingyun with a smug smile and said, "Mo Qingyun, aren’t you powerful? Now we’ll capture Long Yutian and the others in front of you. Then, we’ll torture them in front of you, including that girl Ruo Shui whom I’ve admired for a long time."

Hearing Ma Jue’s words, Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened and his eyes flashed with purple light as he said coldly, "You’re asking for death!"

Chapter 222: Reckless Killing (Third Update)

Eye Power Ray!

As soon as Mo Qingyun spoke, he didn’t hesitate and attacked Ma Jue.

Then a purple ray of light shot out from Mo Qingyun’s eyes, rapidly heading towards Ma Jue.

Eye Demon Ray!

Seeing this purple ray of light, everyone’s expressions changed with fear.

They knew it was the Eye Demon’s technique. Mo Qingyun had mastered the Eye Demon’s techniques.

This meant only one possibility: Mo Qingyun was possessed by an Eye Demon.

As this thought appeared in everyone’s minds, they were shocked and showed expressions of amazement.

"That… That boy is possessed by an Eye Demon. Run, a possessed Eye Demon is even more terrifying."

"It’s said that in the Ten Great Kingdoms, someone was possessed by an Eye Demon and their strength instantly increased several times."

"That person in the Ten Great Kingdoms isn’t that powerful. A man named Cui Wei, when possessed by an Eye Demon, killed over a thousand people with his own strength before being killed by everyone together."

"So terrifying. Why are you still hesitating? Run for your life!"

"Run? Don’t forget that in the Hundred Kingdom Battlefield, all kingdoms have agreed to work together and kill anyone possessed by an Eye Demon."

"If someone breaks this agreement, they’ll be hunted down by all kingdoms."

"Be hunted? I don’t care. With my strength, it’s just a death. I want to live for a few more days."

...

At this moment, people from various kingdoms formed two camps: one advocating killing Mo Qingyun and the other fleeing.

In addition, a small group decided to observe before making a decision based on the situation.

Whiz!

As everyone was shocked, Mo Qingyun’s Eye Power Ray carried a whistling sound and struck Ma Jue.

Puchi!

Facing Mo Qingyun’s Eye Power Ray, Ma Jue was pierced through the head and instantly killed.

"You…"

With his head pierced by Eye Power Ray, Ma Jue’s eyes widened in disbelief as he pointed at Mo Qingyun.

"Big Brother!"

Seeing Ma Jue killed by Mo Qingyun, Ma Hua’s expression twitched with fear.

Then without hesitation, he turned and fled, not daring to stay any longer.

"Go join your big brother!"

Seeing Ma Hua’s actions, Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened and he said coldly before shooting an Eye Power Ray at him.

Puchi!

The Eye Power Ray struck Ma Hua’s head, killing him instantly like his brother.

"Wow! Could this be the technique he mentioned in the Nine Palaces Secret Treasure, that he mastered?"

At this moment, Ling Luo swallowed and showed a look of amazement, feeling somewhat incredulous.

If this was true, Mo Qingyun’s technique was too powerful.

"Maybe…"

"He… He keeps surprising us. Since we first met him, he’s shown various astonishing techniques."

"Brother Long, you… really have a keen eye for talent."

"Heh, I thought so too."

At this moment, Lu Fangliang and the others showed expressions of amazement, feeling somewhat complex.

They were happy that Mo Qingyun was such a powerful person and their companion. But they felt somewhat depressed about the growing gap between them.

"Eye… Eye Demon’s Eyes!"

As everyone was shocked, Eagle Peak’s expression changed and he said in amazement.

After a brief shock, a cold smile appeared on Eagle Peak’s face as he said to Mo Qingyun, "Boy, I was worried about how to deal with you. Now you’ve dug your own grave."

"Boy, do you know?"

Eagle Peak’s face showed a cold smile as he said smugly, "In the Hundred Kingdom Battlefield, once you’re possessed by an Eye Demon, all kingdoms will work together to kill you. You’ll die in our combined attack."

After saying this, Eagle Peak said coldly to the people from various kingdoms, "What are you waiting for? Don’t forget the agreement among all kingdoms."

In his mind, Eagle Peak planned to use the power of surrounding kingdoms to kill Mo Qingyun first and then take his treasures.

Hearing Eagle Peak’s words, people from various kingdoms showed hesitant expressions, considering whether to attack.

"Wait for what? Eagle Kingdom has invited us to act. This is a great opportunity to get treasures."

Seeing the hesitation in people from various kingdoms, someone from the Du family said, "Eagle Kingdom has invited us to act. After we kill Mo Qingyun and get his treasures, Eagle Kingdom won’t have any words to say."

Hearing the Du family’s words, people from various kingdoms showed eager expressions.

"Right. This is a rare opportunity. Once this chance passes, there won’t be another."

"We’ll act now and not let other kingdoms get the first move!"

"Haha, ancient treasures from Nine Palaces Secret Treasure are ours."

"Want to compete with us for the treasure? You’re asking for death!"

...

At this moment, people from various kingdoms charged at Mo Qingyun with greedy expressions.

"Hmm?"

As people from various kingdoms rushed towards Mo Qingyun, Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened and he looked at the person who had provoked them.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened. The one who had provoked them was from the Xia Kingdom Du family.

Realizing this, Mo Qingyun’s mind raced and he understood everything.

The rumor that he had obtained ancient treasures was spread by the Du family.

"Du Family, it’s you who played tricks. I’ll remember this favor."

Mo Qingyun said coldly to the Du family, "From today on, in the Hundred Kingdom Battlefield, you Du Family will have no place to stand. I’ll make the Du Family extinct in the Hundred Kingdom Battlefield."

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, the Du family showed smug smiles. One of them said disdainfully, "Mo Qingyun, talking big won’t make your tongue fall off. Do you think you have a chance to survive facing over a hundred kingdoms?"

"Whether I can survive or not, I’ll kill you first!"

Hearing the Du family’s words, Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened and his eyes flashed with purple light as he shot at one of the Du family members.

Puchi!

The purple light flashed and one of the Du family members was killed instantly by Mo Qingyun’s attack.

Seeing this, other Du family members’ expressions twitched and they quickly hid in the crowd without making any more arrogant remarks.

Seeing people from various kingdoms restraining Mo Qingyun, Eagle Peak showed a cold smile and thought, "Boy, since you’re so sentimental, I’ll first capture your friends. With them in my hands, you’ll have to give up the treasures."

With this thought, Eagle Peak moved swiftly and charged at Long Yutian and the others to capture them.

Seeing Eagle Peak’s actions, Mo Qingyun’s expression changed and understood his intentions.

Eagle Peak planned to use the same tactic, first capturing Long Yutian and the others and then using them to force Mo Qingyun.

Fierce Bird Piercing the Sky

Knowing Eagle Peak’s intentions, Mo Qingyun didn’t hesitate and moved towards Long Yutian and the others, saying to Lu Fangliang, "Brother Lu, come over here."

"Alright!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Long Yutian and the others moved swiftly towards him without hesitation.

Soon, they arrived beside Mo Qingyun, thwarting Eagle Peak’s plan.

Seeing Long Yutian and the others arrive beside him, Mo Qingyun showed a cold smile and said to Eagle Peak, "Eagle Peak, your plan failed."

"Hmph! Boy, don’t be too proud. No matter what, you’ll die today!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Eagle Peak’s expression darkened and he replied with gritted teeth.

"Not your concern!"

After replying to Eagle Peak, Mo Qingyun turned and said coldly to people from various kingdoms, "Everyone, I’m not a bloodthirsty person. Now I give you an opportunity. If you leave immediately, I won’t pursue your actions just now. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being ruthless."

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, people from various kingdoms’ expressions changed with surprise at his actions.

In this situation, Mo Qingyun still dared to say such words. Were they joking?

After a brief silence, the surroundings became noisy with disdainful looks towards Mo Qingyun.

"Boy, do you think we’re scared by your words? Saying a few words and making us leave, you dream!"

"Boy, if you’re smart, hand over the ancient treasures and Nine Palaces Secret Treasure. We’ll give you a chance to die."

"Boy, don’t worry. After you’re dead, we’ll take care of the beauty behind you."

...

At this moment, people from various kingdoms showed disdainful expressions and said arrogant words.

Seeing the reactions of people from various kingdoms, Eagle Peak showed a smug smile and said coldly to Mo Qingyun, "Boy, you’d better kill yourself. Today, you can’t survive."

Facing everyone’s words, Mo Qingyun didn’t respond but showed a bright smile and said, "Alright, very well. It seems I was too kind. Today, I’ll start killing recklessly!"

Chapter 223: Forming an Array and Killing (Fourth Update)

Reckless killing?

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, people from various kingdoms’ expressions changed with surprise as they looked at him.

In their minds, they had thought of many possibilities but never imagined this one.

Mo Qingyun said such words at this moment.

At this moment, the surroundings fell silent as everyone looked at Mo Qingyun with expressions of disbelief.

In their eyes, Mo Qingyun’s actions were like those of a fool, at most a powerful fool.

"Haha, I’m dying laughing."

After a brief silence, laughter broke the quietness. "Boy, your expression when you’re joking is quite amusing."

...
