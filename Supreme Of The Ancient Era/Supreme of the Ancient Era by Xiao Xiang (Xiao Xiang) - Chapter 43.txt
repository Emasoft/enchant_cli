Under the full display of his trump cards, Mo Qingyun's cultivation instantly reached the peak of the Ninth Level Nascent Soul Realm, just a step away from the Half-step Pill Mansion Realm.

Furnace Sun Mountain-Splitting Saber

As his cultivation improved, Mo Qingyun wielded the Fire Silk Saber and slashed at that black giant palm.

Roar!

With Mo Qingyun's slash, the Fire Silk Saber immediately shone brightly. The flaming saber rays were like fire dragons, emitting a low growl as they charged towards the black giant palm.

Bang bang bang...

Then, the True Essence Fire Dragon and the black giant palm collided fiercely, producing a series of loud sounds that made heaven and earth seem to darken.

Under the collision between the Fire Dragon Saber Rays and the giant palm, the fluctuations of True Essence energy spread out like a fleeting flower.

Under this wave of True Essence energy, Mo Qingyun and the others rapidly retreated to avoid being affected by the battle.

Moments later, the giant palm cracked and the fire dragon dispersed; heaven and earth returned to calmness.

But at this moment, everyone was stunned on the spot, unable to believe what they saw with their own eyes.

He caught it!

Mo Qingyun managed to catch the full-strength strike of a Nascent Soul Realm powerhouse, Yuan Sheng.

Not only that, the crowd also noticed that Mo Qingyun's body was covered with a layer of crimson scales.

Soul Transformation!

This is the legendary technique that Nascent Soul Realm powerhouses with super martial souls can possess. Unbelievably, Mo Qingyun achieved it.

"Junior Mister Dan... he actually managed to catch the full-strength strike of a Nascent Soul Realm powerhouse. What terrifying combat strength!"

"Moreover, he can perform soul transformation; this is truly surprising."

"It seems that we all underestimated him. Now, he has the qualifications to fight a Half-step Pill Mansion."

...

Seeing this, everyone around couldn't help but sigh in admiration.

"This is soul transformation! The unique technique of a super martial soul!"

Looking at Mo Qingyun, covered in scales, Wan Lianyun revealed a hint of envy.

This is true talent, innate talent that cannot be changed through hard work later in life.

"Soul transformation! It's soul transformation!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun's current appearance, Chi Lian revealed a look of shock and exclaimed, "Master achieved soul transformation even with the aid of external forces to reach Nascent Soul Realm. This technique is something I can't do; it seems Master's true identity is quite extraordinary, could he be a reincarnated Supreme?"

Compared to others, Chi Lian's experience made him understand how difficult it was for Mo Qingyun to achieve soul transformation.

Even with Chi Lian's peak Profound Realm strength in his previous life, he couldn't achieve this. Only Supreme Realm powerhouses could do it.

Thinking of this, Chi Lian's heart was filled with shock and he looked at Mo Qingyun with a bit of reverence.

"You... you actually possess a super martial soul!"

Seeing that Mo Qingyun successfully blocked his strike under soul transformation, Yuan Sheng's face changed dramatically.

At this moment, he couldn't help but regard Mo Qingyun as an equal opponent.

Seeing Yuan Sheng's shocked expression, Mo Qingyun sneered and said to Chi Lian, "Chi Lian, don't hold back. Let's work together and kill this old dog."

"Yes, Master!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, Chi Lian no longer held back and performed soul transformation.

Roar...

Then, Chi Lian let out a loud roar. His body rapidly inflated and transformed into the form of a seven-headed blood-stained demonic dragon.

Seven Evil Bloodstained Demonic Dragon, this was Chi Lian's current form.

His soul transformation was more thorough than Mo Qingyun's, a perfect form of soul transformation.

"Perfect form of soul transformation! The red-haired old man beside Junior Mister Dan actually possesses a super martial soul."

"This old servant's martial soul seems to be a top-tier Twelfth Level martial soul, the Seven Evil Bloodstained Demonic Dragon martial soul."

"A top-tier Twelfth Level martial soul, the old servant beside Junior Mister Dan actually possesses such a powerful martial soul."

"How many hidden tricks does Junior Mister Dan have? Not only does he possess countless trump cards, but the people around him do as well."

"It seems that Mount Tai Sect and Heavenly Dragon Gang are in trouble this time."

...

Seeing Chi Lian perform soul transformation, the surrounding people were once again shocked and their faces changed.

"Good! Good!"

Seeing this situation, Wan Lianyun, Du Luo and others couldn't help but smile with joy.

Now it seemed that the scales were tipping in their favor, and they might be able to defeat Xue Haotian's group.

"Kill!"

Seeing Chi Lian complete his soul transformation, Mo Qingyun coldly shouted and moved towards Yuan Sheng.

Furnace Sun Mountain-Splitting Saber

Mo Qingyun struck without holding back, unleashing his strongest attack towards Yuan Sheng.

Instantly, a twenty-meter-long flaming saber ray transformed into a fire dragon and charged towards Yuan Sheng with lightning speed.

Bloodthirsty Demon Palm

At the same time, Chi Lian also struck without hesitation and attacked Yuan Sheng together with Mo Qingyun.

With Chi Lian's palm, a blood-colored True Essence force formed into a huge blood palm and descended from above Yuan Sheng's head.

Around the blood palm, there were numerous blood-colored heads floating in the mist, looking extremely eerie.

"Humph, brat, you're too early to be proud."

Seeing Mo Qingyun and Chi Lian attacking him together, Yuan Sheng sneered and summoned his martial soul.

Soul Spider, appear!

Yuan Sheng's martial soul was a top-tier Tenth Level martial soul, the Soul Spider martial soul.

As soon as his martial soul was summoned, Yuan Sheng's aura became even darker.

Soul Locking Heavenly Net!

Facing Mo Qingyun and Chi Lian's powerful attacks, Yuan Sheng didn't hold back either. He immediately unleashed his martial soul technique.

Instantly, a huge black soul force net covered the fire dragon saber rays and blood palm, enveloping them.

Sss...

Enveloped by the Soul Locking Heavenly Net, the fire dragon saber rays and blood palm struggled to break free, producing sharp collision sounds.

After unleashing his martial soul technique and blocking Mo Qingyun's attack, Yuan Sheng revealed a ferocious expression.

"Brat, you can make me reach this point. You can die with honor."

Mo Qingyun didn't take Yuan Sheng's words to heart and replied disdainfully, "Old dog, you're too early to be proud. No matter what means you have, I'll kill you today!"

...

Mo Qingyun no longer hesitated and summoned his Light Gate martial soul.

As soon as the Light Gate martial soul appeared, it emitted an ancient aura and stood in the air above Mo Qingyun as if it were one with heaven and earth.

The light flashing on the Light Gate martial soul was like a stream of time, giving people an endless sense of vicissitude.

This... this is a martial soul!

Mo Qingyun has another martial soul!

At this moment, everyone looked at the Light Gate above Mo Qingyun and were stunned. Their hearts raced.

Too unexpected, too shocking!

Dual martial souls! Mo Qingyun is a rare dual martial soul genius.

What kind of talent is this!

"Dual martial souls, this Mo Young Master..."

Wan Lianyun was shocked and his heart raced. For a moment, he couldn't express his feelings with words.

"Dual martial souls! It's dual martial souls!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun's Light Gate martial soul, Du Luo and the others were all excited and shocked.

Of course, besides being surprised, they also felt joy in their hearts.

"Haha, we've found a treasure!"

Zhao Qi revealed an ecstatic smile and said excitedly, "I never thought I would have such a prodigy disciple."

"Having such a disciple in my life, I haven't lived in vain," Xu Yu said with an excited expression as well.

"Damn it, my eyes are sharp. I saw from the beginning that this kid is not an ordinary person and chose him as the successor of the Pill Master Alliance Guild," Du Luo said with shameless pride.

...

However, at this moment, everyone didn't pay attention to Du Luo's shamelessness but looked at him with envy and sighed.

These three old fellows are truly lucky to have such a disciple, they've found a treasure indeed.

"That's it! That's it!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun's Light Gate martial soul, Mo Hongtian and the others had tears in their eyes.

At this moment, they finally understood.

They were wrong all along and extremely off the mark.

A genius with dual martial souls was treated as a talentless waste by their Mo family, truly ironic.

Even more laughable is that after Mo Qingyun revealed his Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul, they still didn't think he might have dual martial souls.

Instead, they believed that there was an error in their previous test and mistook Mo Qingyun's Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul for the Light Gate martial soul.

Only at this moment did they truly understand.

It wasn't their test that was wrong, but Mo Qingyun possessed dual martial souls they couldn't even imagine.

"Mo family's waste! Truly laughable!"

"We were wrong all along, from the beginning."

"Qingyun is our Mo family's true prodigy. From the start, only we didn't discover him."

"A genius with dual martial souls was treated as a waste by us, our eyes must be blind!"

...

At this moment, Mo Hongtian and the others shed tears and sighed with regret.

Now that everyone was shocked by Mo Qingyun's dual martial souls,

Seal the Gate, seal it for me!

Mo Qingyun's expression turned solemn and he unleashed his martial soul technique towards Yuan Sheng.

As soon as the martial soul technique was released, a miniature Light Gate凝聚在莫青云的手指上，迅速向元盛体内轰去。

嗖！

迷你版光门速度极快，眨眼间便轰入了元盛体内，封印起他的血脉之力。

噗！

受到莫青云的武魂神通攻击，元盛立刻口吐鲜血，面色有些苍白起来。

与此同时，他身上的气势极速减弱，瞬间跌落到了元丹境巅峰的地步。

“封……封印血脉之力！”

感受到体内血脉不畅，元盛立刻色变起来，神情震惊地看向莫青云。

他实在没有想到，莫青云竟然还拥有这样的手段，可以封印别人的血脉之力。

“老狗，你引以为傲的修为没有了，现在我看你还如何嚣张。”

莫青云面露不屑地看了元盛一眼，再次出手向他斩去。

焚阳断山刀

莫青云果断地挥出一刀，直接向元盛的脑袋斩去。

手起刀落，火绫刀再次光芒大盛，迅速凝出一道长达二十米的火焰刀芒。

噬血魔掌

在莫青云出手时，赤炼也没有丝毫迟疑，抬手对着元盛一掌轰出。

一掌轰出，一个巨大的血色手掌迅速凝成，从元盛头顶上空向他镇压而下。

锁魂天网！

面对莫青云二人的出手，元盛不敢迟疑，立刻出手回应。

元盛一掌轰出后，一个黑色的元力大网迅速形成，向刀芒和巨掌包裹而去。

嗤！

然而这一刻，那黑色大网碰到火焰刀芒和血色巨掌后，瞬间被击溃了。

击溃黑色大网后，火焰刀芒和血色巨掌速度不减，继续向元盛轰击而去。

砰！砰！

接着，火焰刀芒和血色巨掌先后轰在了元盛身上，将他轰飞出去。

噗！

接连受到两次重击，元盛立刻口吐鲜血，脸色苍白起来，气息也微弱了许多。

“丹公子和那赤发老者好强，竟然连半步丹府强者都在他们二人出手下重伤。”

“这才是丹公子的真正实力吗？若非亲眼看到，实在无法相信他的实力会强大到这种地步。”

“现在看来，泰山宗和天龙帮危险了，这次他们怕是要阴沟里翻船了。”

...

眼下的结果大大出乎众人的预料，让他们感叹不已。

在众人感叹时，莫青云没有丝毫迟疑，继续向元盛追杀而去。

靠近元盛身旁后，莫青云再次对他斩出一刀，动作干脆、凌厉。

在莫青云出手之际，赤炼同样再次轰出一掌，动作比莫青云更狠辣、凌厉。

原本巅峰实力的元盛都不是莫青云二人对手，更何况现在了。

此刻，面对莫青云二人的出手，元盛立刻被轰飞出去，身上的伤势更重了几分。

身上伤势加重使得元盛的修为再次跌落，此刻他能发挥出来的战力勉强相当于元丹境五重。

见状后，莫青云没有手软，面色一沉道：“老狗，受死吧！”

话落，莫青云向元盛斩出一刀，在他未反应过来前直接穿透了他的胸膛。

“不……小子，你不能杀我。你杀了我，杜家不会放过你们的。”

看到自己胸膛被莫青云洞穿，元盛面露疯狂之色大吼道：“不……我不想死。我是杜家长老，不会死在这个小地方！”

元盛从未想过他会死在连云城这样一个小地方。

原本在他看来，他护送薛枭来到连云城应该是享福、受人奉承。

结果却死在了他从未正眼看待的莫青云手中，这个结果实在让他无法接受。

刺啦！

在元盛大声吼叫下，莫青云拔出了火绫刀，带出一道血雨。

火绫刀被莫青云拔出，元盛瞪大双眼带着不甘之色倒在地上。

一个半步丹府境强者就此身死。

看着这一幕，周围的人立刻沉默了，神情复杂地看向莫青云。
