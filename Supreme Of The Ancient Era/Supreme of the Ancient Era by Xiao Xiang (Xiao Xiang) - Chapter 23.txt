Quick in adapting?

When He Chao said this, the expressions of those around him turned somewhat strange.

He Chao really had thick skin; his act of licking the dog's butt was actually described by him as being quick in adapting.

…

After leaving Piao Xiang Ju, Mo Qingyun returned directly to the Mo family.

Half an hour later, Mo Qingyun arrived back at the Mo family.

As soon as he returned to the Mo family, Mo Qingyun went straight to Mo Feipeng’s residence, intending to report his safety.

After all, on their way back, they encountered an ambush by Xue Ming and others.

When Mo Xin and the other girls returned, they would definitely tell Mo Feipeng about this. Given Mo Feipeng’s personality, he would surely be worried once he knew.

Sure enough, when Mo Qingyun arrived at Mo Feipeng’s residence, Mo Feipeng was frowning with anxiety and pacing back and forth in the courtyard.

“Uncle!”

Seeing Mo Feipeng, Mo Qingyun greeted him.

“Qingyun!”

When he saw Mo Qingyun return, Mo Feipeng’s expression immediately relaxed, and with a look of surprise, he patted Mo Qingyun on the shoulder and said, “It’s good that you’re back. It’s good that you’re back!”

At this moment, Mo Feipeng’s eyes were almost wet with emotion, indicating how excited he was.

Moreover, Mo Qingyun noticed that Mo Feipeng’s eyes were bloodshot, likely the result of not sleeping all night.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun was deeply moved, a sense of indescribable kinship growing in his heart.

“After rushing back, you must be exhausted.”

Mo Feipeng said with a loving expression, smiling gently at Mo Qingyun and saying, “Go rest for a while. I’ll go tell your grandfather and Aunt Er about you returning.”

After saying this, Mo Feipeng walked out of the courtyard.

Seeing Mo Feipeng’s actions, Mo Qingyun was once again moved in his heart; this must be what kinship feels like.

Soon, Mo Hongtian, Mo Yue Ru, and others arrived, their expressions filled with excitement.

As for the girls like Mo Xiao, seeing Mo Qingyun return safely, they clung to his clothes and wept with joy.

In no time, Mo Qingyun’s body was wet in several places from their tears, leaving him somewhat helpless.

At this moment, Mo Xin pretended to be displeased and glared at Mo Qingyun, saying, “You brat, always showing off. Do you know how worried we were after your return?”

“Haha, it won’t happen next time.”

Mo Qingyun smiled faintly, feeling deeply moved.

“Do you want it to happen again!”

Mo Xin glared at Mo Qingyun once more and then said somewhat guiltily, “It’s all because my strength is too weak. Otherwise, I would have been able to help you and not be a burden.”

“Indeed, we are all too weak.”

Mo Xiao and Mo Ling both looked dejected and said guiltily.

Seeing the girls’ guilty expressions, Mo Qingyun was deeply moved; he smiled faintly and said, “Don’t think too much. I’m fine now.”

“Stop standing there; let’s sit down and talk,” Mo Hongtian beckoned, indicating for everyone to take a seat.

After everyone sat down, Mo Hongtian asked, “Qingyun, tell us how you escaped from those people.”

When Mo Hongtian asked this, Mo Feipeng and others also looked curious.

According to Mo Xin’s account, the strongest person among them was a Seventh Level True Qi Realm cultivator.

Mo Qingyun managed to escape unscathed from them, which made everyone very curious indeed.

“It was like this: After Mo Xin and the others left, I took Xue Ming hostage onto their carriage and drove away. Then halfway through, I threw him off the carriage. They should have been hesitant to attack me for fear of a fish dying with the net, right?”

Mo Qingyun slightly altered the true events.

After all, killing Jiang Guardian and others was quite shocking.

If it were known by outsiders, his situation would be very dangerous, even affecting the entire Mo family.

Therefore, before he had enough strength, he wouldn’t tell anyone about it.

Mo Qingyun had some plans; unless in a truly critical situation, he would rather not show his martial soul’s abilities.

After all, his martial soul’s abilities were too extraordinary.

As Mo Qingyun narrated, Mo Hongtian nodded in approval with a look of admiration.

At such an age, to remain calm when encountering such matters was quite remarkable.

Mo Hongtian and others didn’t doubt the truthfulness of Mo Qingyun’s words; only this could explain it.

Otherwise, would he have defeated them and retreated?

A Tenth Level Body Refinement Realm peak defeating a Seventh Level True Qi Realm, was that possible?

After Mo Qingyun’s narration, Mo Hongtian glanced at the time and smiled faintly, saying, “Prepare yourselves; we are heading to our ancestral tomb.”

After giving this instruction, Mo Hongtian left Mo Feipeng’s residence.

“Ancestral tomb?”

When he heard Mo Hongtian’s words, Mo Qingyun asked with a puzzled look.

“Ancestral tomb is an ancient sect’s ruins, also the origin of Beimozhen Town. In fact, we people from Beimozhen Town are descendants of this ancient sect. Therefore, every year the major families in Beimozhen Town send their younger generations to pay respects at the ancestral tomb.”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s confusion, Mo Feipeng explained.

“After paying respects to the ancestors, each family sends their younger generations into the ancestral tomb for training. They hope to encounter some good fortune and obtain treasures left by their ancestors, which is what people call the Town Meeting.”

“So this is the Town Meeting!”

After hearing Mo Feipeng’s explanation, Mo Qingyun understood.

Originally, he thought the Town Meeting was just a competition among the younger generations of several major families in Beimozhen Town.

He didn’t expect that behind the Town Meeting, there were such hidden meanings; he had misunderstood it.

About half an hour later, a senior from the family arrived at Mo Feipeng’s residence and notified Mo Qingyun and others to prepare for departure.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun and the others did not hesitate but got up and left the courtyard.

Soon, they saw Mo Hongtian and others lined up in front of their home.

“Let’s go!”

Seeing Mo Qingyun and others arrive, Mo Hongtian smiled with satisfaction and waved his hand.

Then, Mo Qingyun and others set off towards the ancestral tomb to participate in this year’s Town Meeting.

Chapter 85: Mo Cang, You Are Too Weak! (Fifth Update)

Seeing the procession move forward, Mo Qingyun and others did not hesitate but entered the crowd one after another.

Seeing Mo Qingyun enter the procession, Mo Cang’s expression darkened slightly and unconsciously sensed Mo Qingyun’s cultivation.

“Tenth Level Body Refinement Realm peak!”

Knowing Mo Qingyun’s cultivation, Mo Cang was initially surprised and somewhat amazed by his progress.

He didn’t expect that without entering the Spirit Palace to cultivate, Mo Qingyun’s cultivation could progress so quickly.

But after a brief surprise, Mo Cang sneered and said coldly, “Mo Qingyun, do you remember saying that by the time of the Town Meeting, your cultivation would definitely enter True Qi Realm?”

“Does it have anything to do with you?”

Mo Qingyun glanced at Mo Cang disdainfully and asked indifferently.

“It doesn’t have much to do with me, but I just don’t like people who talk big.”

Mo Cang said mockingly. “Your current cultivation should be Tenth Level Body Refinement Realm peak, and the difference with True Qi Realm is quite significant. With such cultivation, don’t embarrass Mo Family at the Town Meeting and hold everyone back.”

“Talking big? Holding others back?”

Seeing Mo Cang think he only had Tenth Level Body Refinement Realm peak cultivation, Mo Qingyun smiled sardonically and said, “Who knows if they will hold others back. True strength isn’t seen on the surface; some people, even after breaking through to First Level True Qi Realm peak, are still as useless as before.”

The person Mo Qingyun referred to was naturally Mo Cang.

Mo Cang’s cultivation was originally at the half-step True Qi Realm, and after cultivating in the Spirit Palace, his cultivation advanced rapidly.

In just two months, he not only broke through to True Qi Realm but reached First Level True Qi Realm peak.

Thus, Mo Cang felt somewhat proud at this moment, as if he was a crane among chickens.

“Sharp-tongued!”

When Mo Cang heard this, his expression darkened and he raised his hand to strike at Mo Qingyun coldly. “It seems I have to teach you a lesson; now let me show you the difference between True Qi Realm and Body Refinement Realm.”

*冥虎鬼手*

Mo Qingyun struck out without holding back, aiming a claw at Mo Cang.

From the look on Mo Cang’s face, he intended to disable Mo Qingyun in one blow.

This showed how much hatred Mo Cang harbored for Mo Qingyun.

Feeling the commotion from behind, Mo Hongtian and others in front turned around to look.

“Mo Cang, stop!”

When they saw Mo Cang attacking Mo Qingyun, they all became angry.

The Town Meeting was about to start; now Mo Cang was fighting with Mo Qingyun, engaging in a family feud.

This behavior was quite foolish.

If one of them got injured, it would weaken the overall strength of Mo Family’s younger generation.

Knowing that he and Mo Qingyun were both key figures among the younger generation, if they fought to a standstill, how would Mo Family compete with other families in the Town Meeting?

At this moment, Mo Cang had decided to show Mo Qingyun a lesson.

So when the seniors spoke, he continued his actions and struck at Mo Qingyun again.

Seeing Mo Cang’s continuous action, some seniors did not hesitate and moved to stop him.

“Get out of here!”

Facing the sudden attack from Mo Cang, Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened and he raised his hand to meet it.

Bang!

Then everyone saw Mo Cang, who had been so imposing earlier, being sent flying by Mo Qingyun’s punch like a dead dog.

Puh!

Under Mo Qingyun’s attack, Mo Cang spat out a mouthful of blood and his face turned pale.

One move! A First Level True Qi Realm peak cultivator like Mo Cang was seriously injured by Mo Qingyun.

Everyone was stunned; this result far exceeded their expectations.

Wasn’t Mo Qingyun only at Tenth Level Body Refinement Realm peak cultivation?

When did Body Refinement Realm cultivators become so powerful that they could easily trample True Qi Realm experts?

According to their imagination, the result should have been the opposite; it shouldn’t be like this.

“Useless is useless, even after breaking through to True Qi Realm.”

Mo Qingyun glanced at the fallen Mo Cang and said disdainfully, “Mo Cang, you are too weak!”

Too weak!

When Mo Qingyun said this, the expressions of those around him changed again, showing a bitter smile.

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Mo Cang’s face turned red with anger and he looked at Mo Qingyun angrily. “You… you concealed your cultivation; it’s not Tenth Level Body Refinement Realm peak.”

Mo Qingyun had concealed his cultivation?

When Mo Cang said this, everyone’s expressions changed again and they looked at Mo Qingyun with a bitter smile.

This guy could still hide; he always pretended to be weak and then showed his strength.

What was even harder for them to accept was that Mo Cang, like a fool, always ran into him.

“Did I say I was Tenth Level Body Refinement Realm peak?”

Mo Qingyun glanced at Mo Cang mockingly and said disdainfully, “Do you think everyone is like you, boasting without substance? You are a half-full bucket that makes noise.”

After saying this, Mo Qingyun revealed some of his cultivation in front of everyone.

Soon, the aura around Mo Qingyun rapidly increased and reached True Qi Realm level in an instant.

True Qi Realm!

Mo Qingyun’s cultivation had truly entered True Qi Realm!

Feeling Mo Qingyun’s aura, everyone was shocked.

Of course, besides the shock, they were also delighted.

Mo Qingyun having True Qi Realm cultivation meant that Mo Family’s younger generation’s overall strength had risen to a new level, giving them an advantage in the Town Meeting.

“Good, good, very good!”

Seeing Mo Qingyun display True Qi Realm cultivation, Mo Hongtian’s face was filled with joy and he praised him repeatedly.

To have such a grandson, what more could one ask for!

“This kid is hiding his strength again; it’s always like this, making us worry and then pleasantly surprised.”

Mo Xin glared at Mo Qingyun but her face was also filled with joy.

“I said so, how could he not have broken through to True Qi Realm? I guessed right again.”

Mo Xiao smiled and winked at Mo Ling, who also smiled.

“This kid…”

Mo Feipeng and Mo Yue Ru exchanged glances, both nodding with joy.

At this moment, under everyone’s gaze, Mo Qingyun said to Mo Cang again, “With the help of the Spirit Palace, you are only at First Level True Qi Realm peak; what’s there to be proud of?”

“With your current strength, don’t hold everyone back at the Town Meeting!”

After saying this disdainful sentence to Mo Cang, Mo Qingyun turned and walked towards the front, no longer paying attention to the stunned Mo Cang.

Don’t hold everyone back?

Wasn’t this what he just said to Mo Qingyun?

But now, in a short moment, Mo Qingyun returned the original words to him, and he couldn’t refute it.

At this moment, Mo Cang’s heart was filled with bitterness; a strong sense of defeat grew in his heart.

“Alright, let’s continue on our journey.”

Seeing the time, Mo Hongtian waved his hand and indicated for everyone to continue.

When Mo Hongtian spoke, everyone did not hesitate but continued their journey.

However, the way they looked at Mo Qingyun changed slightly.

This young man once again brought them a surprise.

They were very curious about how Mo Qingyun would perform in the Town Meeting and what surprises he would bring.

Chapter 86: The Town Meeting Begins

The location of the ancestral tomb was in a hidden mountain range several miles outside Beimozhen Town.

About an hour later, Mo Qingyun and others arrived at the ancestral tomb.

When the Mo Family arrived, some other families had already come ahead of time.

“Brother Hongtian, your Mo Family is late this time!”

Some people from other families greeted Mo Hongtian when they saw him arrive.

Mo Hongtian smiled faintly and responded politely to their greetings.

Soon, people from the Song Family and He Family approached Mo Family’s group.

When the Song family members got closer, Song Zihao walked out from among them and came to Mo Qingyun.

“Mo Qingyun, I heard you are now the top of your generation in Mo Family?”

When he said this, Song Zihao had a mocking expression and shook his head in disappointment. “As one of the three major families in Beimozhen Town, Mo Family’s top this year is only a Tenth Level Body Refinement Realm peak cultivator; it’s truly disappointing.”

“Enough to deal with you,” Mo Qingyun said calmly.

“Humph! Talking big without fear of being ridiculed!”

Right after Mo Qingyun spoke, Song Xiu Yun beside him said disdainfully. “Mo Qingyun, let me tell you that my elder brother is now at Third Level True Qi Realm cultivation.”

Third Level True Qi Realm!

When Song Xiu Yun said this, everyone’s expressions changed; they were somewhat shocked by Song Zihao’s cultivation.

Usually, in the annual Town Meeting, having one or two young cultivators at True Qi Realm was already considered good.

Who would have thought that Song Zihao’s cultivation had reached Third Level True Qi Realm, which was quite impressive.

Thus, the expressions of some seniors from surrounding families were filled with envy when they looked at Song Family.

Song Family having such a young talent was truly fortunate.

Many people thought that if there were no unexpected events, the first place in this year’s Town Meeting would definitely be Song Family.

Under everyone’s shocked gaze, Song Zihao proudly raised his head and said smugly, “Mo Qingyun, do you still think you can deal with me now?”

Song Zihao continued, “Your progress is indeed surprising to me, but even so, you are still insignificant in front of me. After entering the ancestral tomb, it’s best to pray not to meet me; otherwise, I won’t mind giving you another lesson.”

When he said this, Song Zihao emphasized the word “lesson” heavily.

Clearly, his meaning was not just a lesson but something more serious.

After Song Zihao spoke, Song Xiu Yun beside him said smugly, “Mo Qingyun, are you now regretting saying such ignorant words just now?”

“Regretful?”

Mo Qingyun narrowed his eyes, glanced at Song Zihao and then looked at Song Xiu Yun with a playful smile. “Just Third Level True Qi Realm cultivation; often, one’s true strength isn’t seen on the surface.”

When Mo Qingyun said this, the expressions of Mo Family’s younger generation changed involuntarily.

Especially Mo Cang; his face turned slightly red, feeling a sense of humiliation.

“Haha… Mo Qingyun, you really know how to joke.”

When he heard this from Mo Qingyun, Song Zihao laughed loudly and said, “Do you think with your Tenth Level Body Refinement Realm peak cultivation, you can still fight back in front of me?”

“Whether or not I can fight back will be known then.”

Mo Qingyun replied indifferently to Song Zihao and said with a playful smile, “Also, I’ll tell you that I’m quite vengeful. Whatever you brought to me in the past, I’ll return it to you during this Town Meeting; don’t let me meet you in the ancestral tomb.”

When he said this, a cold light flashed in Mo Qingyun’s eyes.

Since his rebirth, he had sworn to avenge the previous life; thus, Song Zihao must die.

If Mo Qingyun met Song Zihao in the ancestral tomb, he would definitely kill him.

“Alright, I’ll see how you take revenge on me.”

Song Zihao also smiled coldly and confronted Mo Qingyun.

For a moment, a strong sense of confrontation spread between Mo Qingyun and Song Zihao.

At this moment, as Mo Qingyun and Song Zihao were talking, all the families had gathered.

Seeing everyone arrive, Mo Hongtian, He Qiansheng, and Song Xu walked out and said, “Since everyone is here, let’s start the ancestor worship ceremony.”

Soon, various items for worshipping ancestors were laid out one after another.

About an hour later, the ancestor worship ceremony ended.

After the ancestor worship ceremony was over, it was time for the Town Meeting to begin.

Seeing this, Mo Hongtian and others did not hesitate but began explaining the rules of the Town Meeting.

“Each of you will be given an identity card shortly; with this, you can enter any mansion in the ancestral tomb.”

“After entering the ancestral tomb, you can also seize others’ identity cards; the number of identity cards you hold will determine your performance in the first round.”

“To have a harvest and perform well in the Town Meeting, you must protect the identity card given to each of you.”

…

Mo Hongtian and others explained the rules for the first round of the Town Meeting to everyone one after another.

After hearing Mo Hongtian’s explanation, Mo Qingyun’s expression changed slightly and he showed a playful smile.

With this, the competition would likely become much more intense and cruel.

It seemed that the Town Meeting was not just an exchange and competition among young generations of various families.

More like a contest between the families, trying to weaken other families’ foundations through this method.

After all, when young generations entered the ancestral tomb to compete for identity cards, some would inevitably fall.

And a family’s hope lies in its young generation; if the young generation dies out, the family won’t last long.

After a moment, Mo Qingyun and others received their identity cards; one hundred eighty people entered the ancestral tomb.

“Let’s start.”

Seeing everyone receive their identity cards, Mo Hongtian and others nodded to the leaders of other families.

Then, each family leader took out a key and inserted it into the keyhole of the ancestral tomb’s stone door.

After inserting the keys, the stone doors began to shake and slowly opened.

Bam bam bam…

As the door was opened, the ground shook with a rumbling sound.

After the stone doors were opened, an ancient aura spread out from within; the ruins of this ancient sect appeared before everyone.

“The stone door can only remain open for half an hour; everyone, hurry into the ancestral tomb.”

Seeing the stone door opened, He Qiansheng urged the young generation to enter.

After hearing his words, Mo Qingyun and others entered the ancestral tomb one after another.

Chapter 87: Who Is That Guy? (Second Update)

As soon as Mo Qingyun entered the ancestral tomb, he felt a dark and corrosive aura hit him.

The light in the ancestral tomb was poor, barely allowing them to see a range of ten meters around.

After scanning the surroundings, Mo Qingyun saw some grayish-white shadows floating around them.

These grayish-white figures exuded a cold, bloodthirsty, and resentful aura.

“These are ghosts and vengeful spirits…”

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun’s expression changed slightly; he didn’t expect to see such things in the ancestral tomb.

At this moment, before Mo Qingyun could think further, these vengeful spirits and ghosts attacked them crazily.

The ghosts and vengeful spirits had no physical form, so they couldn’t cause physical harm but could inflict spiritual damage.

Therefore, compared to some beasts’ danger, they were even more dangerous.

“It’s ghosts and vengeful spirits; everyone run!”

When attacked by the ghosts and vengeful spirits, someone shouted in fear.

Soon, those at the entrance began to flee desperately.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun frowned and released his spiritual power to sense the surroundings.

He intended to find Mo Xin’s whereabouts, seeing if she was nearby.

After sensing for a while, Mo Qingyun found that Mo Xin wasn’t here; she must have left earlier.

Seeing Mo Xin had already left, Mo Qingyun didn’t deliberately look for her and thought to himself, “With Mo Xin’s True Qi Realm cultivation, she should be able to protect herself; fortunately, Xiao Xiao didn’t come in.”

In Mo Qingyun’s view, if the ancestral tomb was dangerous even for True Qi Realm cultivators, Beimozhen Town’s families wouldn’t let these Seventh and Eighth Level Body Refinement Realm young cultivators enter.

Young generations are the future of a family; they wouldn’t let these young ones come in to die.

*魂天印*

Facing the vengeful spirits attacking him, Mo Qingyun pointed his hand and summoned a soul battle seal to strike at the vengeful spirit.

Ah!

Under the attack of the soul battle seal, the vengeful spirit let out a scream and dissipated into nothingness.

“Eh!”

When Mo Qingyun defeated the vengeful spirits and ghosts around him, he was surprised to find that those who were attacked by the vengeful spirits and ghosts acted strangely.

At this moment, their expressions were blank as if they had lost their souls.

“These people seem to have been controlled by the vengeful spirits and ghosts; is it possession, but not quite…”

Mo Qingyun frowned deeply, filled with doubts and thought to himself, “It seems there are many secrets in this ancestral tomb; quite a few unknown dangers. It’s not as simple as everyone says, I need to be more careful.”

With this thought, Mo Qingyun became cautious and ventured deeper into the ancestral tomb.

To his surprise, inside the ancestral tomb, vengeful spirits and ghosts became much rarer.

Although Mo Qingyun was somewhat surprised by this, he didn’t pay too much attention to it.

As they ventured deeper into the ancestral tomb, some dilapidated mansions and palaces gradually appeared before Mo Qingyun’s eyes.

Although these palaces were in ruins, from their scale and grandeur, one could still see that this ancient sect was once quite powerful.

At least to Mo Qingyun, the Alchemy Alliance in Liancheng City was not as powerful as this ancient sect.

After a moment, a relatively well-preserved mansion appeared before Mo Qingyun’s eyes.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun entered and wanted to see if he could find any treasures inside.

To his surprise, when he entered the mansion, there were already several people inside.

Seeing Mo Qingyun appear, they first looked surprised and then sneered.

“Boy, hand over your identity card, kneel down and beg for mercy, then leave; we won’t kill you.”

One of them raised his head and ordered Mo Qingyun.

“Hand over your identity card, you won’t kill me?”

Hearing this, Mo Qingyun smiled and said, “Alright then; now you all hand over your identity cards to me, kneel down and admit your mistake, I won’t kill you.”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, these people were surprised and didn’t expect him to answer like this.

Then they all laughed, as if hearing a good joke.

They were all Eighth and Ninth Level Body Refinement Realm cultivators; Mo Qingyun talking to them like this was truly reckless.

Did he think that with just one person, he could defeat all of them?

“Haha, did you hear that? This boy is making us hand over our identity cards and kneel to beg for mercy.”

“Who does he think he is? Song Zihao of the Song Family, a Third Level True Qi Realm expert?”

“Alright then, just a boy with some mental issues; let’s get rid of him.”

“He must be from one of the families to fill numbers, so let’s send him in to die and save our elite young generation from being killed.”

…

These people mocked Mo Qingyun.

“Boy, have you seen martial techniques before? Now I’ll show you what a martial technique is.”

*冰蚕内劲*

After saying this, he struck out with his palm and unleashed a martial technique.

Mo Qingyun felt a faint cold aura emanating from the man’s palm.

But this cold aura was too weak to cause harm, so Mo Qingyun didn’t bother dodging.

Bang!

Then his palm struck solidly on Mo Qingyun’s body.

“Boy, with your strength, you dare make us hand over our identity cards and kneel to beg for mercy?”

Seeing his palm hit Mo Qingyun, the man sneered and said coldly.

But soon he realized something was wrong and his expression changed.

Because Mo Qingyun stood there unharmed after being hit, it meant that his attack didn’t cause any harm to Mo Qingyun.

His cultivation was Ninth Level Body Refinement Realm, and Mo Qingyun stood unscathed after his full-strength attack; what was Mo Qingyun’s cultivation?

At this moment, these people were stunned; they seemed to have hit a hard spot.

Was Mo Qingyun at True Qi Realm?

“What is this martial technique?”

Mo Qingyun smiled sardonically and shook his head, saying, “It doesn’t seem very impressive.”

Then, amidst everyone’s shock, Mo Qingyun slowly took a step forward.

As he stepped out, wind blades appeared around him and swept wildly.

Sss…

Under the sweeping of these wind blades, soon these people were injured with wounds all over their bodies.

Seeing this, these people were terrified and looked at Mo Qingyun in shock.

Just one step forward and he injured all of them; what kind of power was this?

What kind of freak did they provoke!

At this moment, they lost their ability to think and their legs turned weak.

“Brother, we were blind; we didn’t recognize a great man. Hand over our identity cards to you and beg for mercy.”

Then, these people didn’t hesitate and knelt down to beg.

Seeing their pants wet with urine, Mo Qingyun glanced at them disdainfully and took their identity cards, saying coldly, “Get out!”

“Thank you for sparing our lives.”

Hearing Mo Qingyun tell them to get out, these people felt relieved and ran away.

After leaving the mansion, they were still in a state of shock, saying fearfully, “Who was that guy? How could there be such a terrifying person in the ancestral tomb; isn’t it true that those over twenty years old can’t enter?”

One of them said palely, “Do you think that guy is Song Zihao?”

“Song Zihao I’ve seen; he’s definitely not him, but I feel that this guy is even more terrifying than Song Zihao.”

Another one said.

“Stop talking nonsense, let’s run; if that guy changes his mind, we won’t be able to escape.”

At this moment, another Ninth Level Body Refinement Realm cultivator said.

Hearing his words, the others changed their expressions and ran away without hesitation.

Chapter 88: Mo Xin in Danger (Third Update)

Seeing the few people run away quickly, Mo Qingyun didn’t pay them any attention and looked at the five identity cards in his hand.

“Not bad!”

Getting five identity cards at once, Mo Qingyun was quite satisfied with this harvest.

After putting away the identity cards, Mo Qingyun entered a room in the mansion.

As soon as he entered the room, Mo Qingyun saw several skeletons lying on the ground or leaning against the walls.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun’s expression changed and he was deeply shocked.

With his eyesight, he immediately realized that everyone in this room had been killed by a single strike.

A single strike, killing over ten martial artists without damaging their bones; this was quite a terrifying ability.

“Soul technique, these people should have died from soul techniques!”

Seeing the cause of their deaths, Mo Qingyun was shocked and somewhat surprised by this result.

Only a soul technique could kill without damaging the bones; that was what happened here.

Mo Qingyun was curious about how this ancient sect had provoked such an existence, leading to them being dealt with so harshly.

In Mo Qingyun’s view, the ancient sect’s former strength was not enough to attract such attention.

After calming down a bit, Mo Qingyun continued into the room to see if there were any valuable items.

Perhaps due to the long time or because others had already taken what was valuable, there were no valuable items left in the room except for these skeletons.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun exited the room.

Then he entered other rooms one after another but found nothing valuable in any of them.
