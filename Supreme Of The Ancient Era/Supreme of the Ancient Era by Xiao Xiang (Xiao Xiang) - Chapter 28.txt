Chapter 103: Extracting Poison (Third Update)

In Mo Feilin's residence.

Not long after, Mo Qingyun and another person arrived here.

Arriving at Mo Feilin's residence, Mo Qingyun pushed the crowd aside and walked to the bedside.

At this moment, Mo Feilin's face was pale, lying weakly on the bed with deep wounds visible.

At this time, Chih Lian was sitting beside Mo Feilin, using his essence force to heal the wounds.

Seeing Chih Lian treating Mo Feilin's injuries, Mo Qingyun's expression improved considerably.

With Chih Lian's intervention, Mo Feilin’s injuries should not be a problem anymore.

After Chih Lian finishes healing Mo Feilin's wounds, he will then brew a medicinal pill for Mo Qingyun to take and recover.

"Grandfather, who was it that attacked him?"

Mo Qingyun looked at Mo Hongtian beside him and asked with a cold expression.

"We don't know yet. The person who brought Feilin back said that if you want to know the attacker, you can go and talk at the City Lord's Mansion."

Mo Hongtian said solemnly.

"Could it be the Xue family?"

At this moment, Mo Qingyun's brows furrowed as he guessed.

While Mo Qingyun was guessing, Mo Hongtian continued: "Also, the people from the City Lord's Mansion said that the elders' lineage in Beimozhen Town has been exterminated, and the person who injured Feilin was part of that group."

"The elders' lineage in Beimozhen Town has been exterminated?"

Hearing this, Mo Qingyun's expression changed in surprise.

After a brief moment of shock, Mo Qingyun felt more certain about his guess and thought: "It seems that the matter of me killing Xue Ming has been exposed. Otherwise, the Xue family wouldn't have taken such actions against our Mo family."

At this moment, Mo Qingyun felt a bit relieved that he had brought Mo Hongtian and others to Lianyun City.

Otherwise, if Mo Hongtian and the rest stayed in Beimozhen Town, they would likely face retaliation from the Xue family and suffer misfortune.

Thinking of this, Mo Qingyun's expression turned frosty as he clenched his fists and silently resolved: "Xue family, I will remember this. One day, I will exterminate your entire clan."

"I should thank the City Lord's Mansion this time. If they hadn't intervened, Uncle Four would have been in grave danger."

Mo Qingyun's expression was solemn as he thought: "It seems that I need to find time to go and thank them."

Regardless of the City Lord's Mansion’s motives, Mo Qingyun would remember their kindness.

At this moment, Mo Hongtian said with some difficulty: "Qingyun, Grandfather asks you for a favor."

Mo Qingyun replied: "Grandfather, just tell me what you want directly."

"Grandfather hopes that in the future, you will find out who the murderer is and kill them all. Although Mo Kuide and others committed great treachery, they are still descendants of the Mo family..."

Mo Hongtian said angrily with red eyes.

Hearing this, Mo Qingyun nodded and replied: "Grandfather, you can rest assured. They won't escape."

Mo Qingyun could understand Mo Hongtian's thoughts.

Although Mo Kuide and others committed great treachery, as the head of the Mo family, Mo Hongtian could not watch his clan members be killed without doing anything.

After a moment, Chih Lian stopped his actions and came to Mo Qingyun's side: "Young Master, Fourth Young Lord Mo Feilin’s injuries have stabilized."

"Thank you,"

Mo Qingyun looked at Chih Lian gratefully and said: "Come with me to the City Lord's Mansion."

"It is what an old servant should do," Chih Lian waved his hand.

Then, Mo Qingyun instructed Mo Hongtian and left the Jade Mansion for the City Lord's Mansion.

When he walked out of the Jade Mansion, Mo Qingyun saw many city guards guarding outside.

These guards were no longer hiding in the shadows but openly protecting.

Seeing these guards, Mo Qingyun felt a sense of gratitude.

He and the City Lord's Mansion had no prior connection, yet they helped him so much.

Especially at this moment when the Mo family was in its most difficult time, the City Lord's Mansion’s help was like a ray of sunshine.

The Jade Mansion was not far from the City Lord's Mansion, and soon Mo Qingyun arrived at the City Lord’s Mansion.

"Mo Qingyun comes to pay respects to City Lord Wan!"

Upon arriving at the City Lord's Mansion, Mo Qingyun announced his identity.

"Mr. Dan, please!"

The guards immediately showed respect and led the way: "Before you arrived, City Lord instructed me to bring Mr. Dan to the back garden to meet him."

Soon, Mo Qingyun and Chih Lian were led by the guards to the back garden.

In the back garden, a middle-aged man with pale complexion and slightly purple lips was sitting there.

Beside him sat a handsome young man, Wan Yuexuan.

Seeing the two people, Mo Qingyun quickly guessed that the middle-aged man was Wan Lianyun, the City Lord of Lianyun City.

"Junior Mo Qingyun greets City Lord Wan."

Walking to the middle-aged man, he bowed.

"Mr. Dan, no need for formalities,"

Wan Lianyun smiled and pointed to a stone bench: "Please, take a seat!"

Then, Mo Qingyun and Chih Lian sat down.

"For the Xue family's attack on our Mo family, thank you for your assistance, City Lord Wan."

After sitting down, Mo Qingyun thanked him directly.

"It's a small matter. Mr. Dan, don't worry about it," Wan Lianyun waved his hand and smiled.

"For you, City Lord, it might be a small matter. But for me, it is an extremely important affair."

Mo Qingyun said seriously: "If the City Lord's Mansion hadn't intervened, an important relative of mine would have been killed by the Xue family."

"You already knew it was the Xue family," Wan Lianyun said in surprise.

"The Xue family did this because they knew I killed Xue Ming."

Mo Qingyun replied calmly: "City Lord Wan, if my guess is correct, you helped me because of the poison on your body."

"Haha, Mr. Dan is very clever; nothing can hide from you,"

Wan Lianyun said, his expression changing.

"Seems I underestimated this Mr. Dan; he is quite intelligent. The Xue family will have a headache from now on."

"I think, besides the poison on your body, there is nothing else you need my help with,"

Mo Qingyun smiled.

"Hmm!"

Wan Lianyun was slightly surprised and then said: "Since you figured it out, I will be honest. I helped you to make a good connection."

"I hope that when you advance to the third level of alchemy, you can help me see if my poison can be cured."

Seeing Wan Lianyun's honest words, Mo Qingyun felt a bit of goodwill towards him.

Then, Mo Qingyun calmly said: "Your poison can be cured."

"Really?"

Hearing this, Wan Yuexuan and Wan Lianyun were both excited.

"Yes,"

Mo Qingyun nodded: "The poison you have is the Shadow Silk Essence Scattering Poison, an invisible and intangible poison that slowly consumes essence force until one becomes a cripple. It only affects those below the Essence Mansion realm."

"You know so much about my poison..."

Seeing Mo Qingyun describe his poison in detail, Wan Lianyun was shocked.

"If it is convenient for you now, I can extract the poison,"

Mo Qingyun asked.

"Convenient! Very convenient!"

Wan Lianyun said excitedly, his body trembling slightly.

Then, Mo Qingyun began to extract the poison from Wan Lianyun using silver needles.

Soon, drops of black blood dripped onto the ground.

As the black blood flowed out, Wan Lianyun's aura gradually recovered.

After a moment, Mo Qingyun pulled the silver needle and said to Wan Lianyun: "City Lord, your poison has accumulated for a long time. You need to undergo this process several times. I will come again in two months."

"Thank you, Mr. Dan! Yuexuan, escort Mr. Dan,"

Wan Lianyun thanked him and instructed Wan Yuexuan.

Then, Mo Qingyun left the City Lord's Mansion with Wan Yuexuan and returned to the Jade Mansion.

Chapter 104: Slaying the Nascent Soul

Returning to the Jade Mansion, Mo Qingyun began to refine medicinal pills in seclusion for treating Mo Feilin's injuries.

After a day, the medicinal pills were completed.

Mo Qingyun took the pills to Mo Feilin's residence. At this time, Mo Feilin had already awakened.

Seeing Mo Qingyun arrive, Mo Feilin smiled with relief: "You this little monkey, having a super martial soul and not telling us for so long."

Hearing this, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and handed the refined medicinal pills to Mo Feilin: "Uncle Four, these are the medicinal pills I made for you. Take them and your injuries should be healed."

Mo Qingyun can refine medicinal pills?

Seeing Mo Qingyun take out the medicinal pills, Mo Hongtian and others were surprised.

Hearing this, Mo Feilin smiled helplessly: "Father, you don't know. Qingyun is now the disciple of the City Lord's Mansion and two elders in the Alchemy Alliance, and he is Lianyun City’s first alchemy genius."

"What?"

Hearing this, Mo Hongtian and others were shocked.

"God bless our Mo family," they laughed.

"That's why when we entered the city, those people called Qingyun 'Mr. Dan.'"

Mo Yueyu and others were enlightened.

After a brief conversation, Mo Hongtian asked: "Qingyun, do you know who killed Mo Kuide and injured Uncle Four?"

Mo Qingyun said solemnly: "I already know. It was the Xue family!"

"The Xue family?"

Hearing this, Mo Feilin's expression changed with worry.

"Is the Xue family powerful?"

Hearing this, Mo Hongtian and others were tense.

"Yes,"

Mo Feilin nodded: "In Lianyun City, the Xue family's strength ranks among the top twenty."

"This..."

Hearing this, Mo Hongtian and others were shocked.

Lianyun City was not like Beimozhen Town; even the weakest there were much stronger than the Mo family.

How powerful would a clan ranked in the top twenty be?

"Grandfather, don't worry. I have my ways to deal with the Xue family."

Mo Qingyun smiled and comforted them.

Then, Mo Qingyun talked with Mo Hongtian for a while before leaving Mo Feilin's room.

Afterwards, he left the Jade Mansion with Chih Lian and headed towards the Fentian Sect ruins.

"Master, we are being followed,"

After leaving Lianyun City, Chih Lian said with a change in expression.

"A Nascent Soul realm. The Xue family really values me,"

Mo Qingyun said with a cold smile: "Don't mind it, let's continue."

Then, Mo Qingyun and Chih Lian walked straight ahead as if they hadn't noticed the person behind them.

"Here, we are far from Lianyun City. We can act without worrying about the City Lord's Mansion,"

After a few minutes, seeing they were far from Lianyun City, the person said coldly: "Youngsters, you can't escape anymore."

Hearing this, Mo Qingyun and Chih Lian stopped and turned to look at him.

"The Xue family really values me, sending a Nascent Soul realm expert to assassinate me,"

Mo Qingyun smiled disdainfully.

"Lianyun City's first alchemy genius with a super martial soul, naturally needs to be treated carefully,"

The person said coldly: "I, Xue Lve, have been in Lianyun City for decades and never killed a genius like you."

"You seem to be very confident. Do you think you can definitely kill us?"

Mo Qingyun smiled: "Haha, indeed arrogant and ignorant."

Xue Lve laughed: "Do you think with your True Qi realm Fourth Level and a half-step Nascent Soul, you have any chance of survival in front of me?"

"If you were a Nascent Soul Second Level, perhaps you could say that. But with your Nascent Soul First Level, you don't have the qualifications."

Mo Qingyun looked at him disdainfully and said to Chih Lian: "Chih Lian, attack."

The Light Gate martial soul appeared!

As he spoke, Mo Qingyun summoned his Light Gate martial soul.

Then, an ancient aura emanated from the Light Gate martial soul.

What kind of martial soul is this?

Seeing Mo Qingyun's white Light Gate martial soul, Xue Lve and Chih Lian were shocked.

"Master, you have a twin martial soul!"

Chih Lian was amazed. Even with his past experiences, he rarely saw a twin martial soul.

"Youngster, I didn't expect you to have a twin martial soul!"

After the shock, Xue Lve said coldly: "But this makes me want to eliminate you more. Few people have the chance to kill a twin martial soul genius."

Seal Gate, seal!

At this moment, Mo Qingyun directly used his martial soul technique.

Then, a miniature Light Gate entered Xue Lve's body.

Nascent Soul First Level Late... Nascent Soul First Level Early, half-step Nascent Soul.

As the miniature Light Gate entered Xue Lve's body, his cultivation rapidly weakened.

"How... how is it possible? Your martial soul technique can seal the bloodline force."

Feeling his bloodline force being greatly suppressed and sealed, Xue Lve was shocked.

"Such powerful martial soul technique!"

Seeing this, Chih Lian's expression changed in shock.

After a moment of shock, he said with a cold smile: "Nascent Soul First Level. After refining you, my cultivation will recover to Nascent Soul realm. It's been a long time since I had such a good supplement."

Blood Mist弥漫!

Chih Lian moved, and a crimson blood mist surrounded him.

As Chih Lian approached, Xue Lve was enveloped in the blood mist.

Under the blood mist's influence, Xue Lve felt his blood being slowly drawn out and dissolved into it.

Seeing this, Xue Lve was shocked with fear in his eyes.

Blood Thirsty Demon Slash

Chih Lian struck, and a crimson essence force formed into a demon face, devouring Xue Lve.

Seeing the rapidly approaching essence force demon face, Xue Lve's complexion paled with fear.

He never expected that with his Nascent Soul realm cultivation, he would end up in such a situation.

Although panicked, Xue Lve, as a Nascent Soul realm expert, quickly suppressed his fear and retaliated.

Sun Shadow Lightning Shield

Xue Lve struck out with both palms, a dazzling light like the sun appeared.

Outside this radiant light were arcs of lightning forming into a shield, facing the essence force demon face.

Sizzling...

The Sun Shadow Lightning Shield and the essence force demon face collided, sparks flying as essence force surged.

Soul Heaven Seal

Mo Qingyun attacked again, summoning eighteen soul seals and striking Xue Lve.

Then, the eighteen soul seals struck into Xue Lve's mind like meteors.

Ah!

Struck by the eighteen soul seals, Xue Lve's spirit was injured and he cried out in pain.

In a battle between experts, victory or defeat can be decided by half a move. Seeing Xue Lve distracted, Chih Lian seized the opportunity and struck.

Blood Thirsty Demon Palm

Chih Lian's palm hit Xue Lve's head, crushing it.

At the same time, Chih Lian extracted Xue Lve’s essence blood and formed it into a ball.

"Let's go!"

Seeing Xue Lve killed, Mo Qingyun didn't hesitate and said to Chih Lian.

Mo Qingyun was worried that the Xue family had other plans and sent more people out. To avoid unnecessary trouble, they should leave early.

Seeing Mo Qingyun's actions, Chih Lian followed without hesitation.

After a while, they stopped in a quiet forest.

"Go and refine the essence blood,"

Mo Qingyun said to Chih Lian, knowing his cultivation method well.

Chih Lian's cultivation method allowed him to quickly enhance his cultivation by absorbing others' essence blood.

"Thank you, Master!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun allow him to absorb Xue Lve's essence blood, Chih Lian was delighted.

Mo Qingyun took out some medicinal pills and began refining them while Chih Lian refined the essence blood.

Chapter 105: Repaying Kindness with Enmity (Second Update)

A day later.

"Hmm!"

Mo Qingyun, in meditation, suddenly opened his eyes and looked at Chih Lian beside him.

Around Chih Lian's body, the essence force was gathering wildly.

Moreover, a mysterious power was slowly condensing around him.

Soon, the essence force and the mysterious power began to merge and condense.

"Chih Lian is about to break through to the Nascent Soul realm,"

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly.

If Chih Lian broke through to the Nascent Soul realm, his strength would greatly increase and be more helpful.

After about an hour, the fluctuations in Chih Lian's aura gradually subsided and became internalized.

At this moment, Chih Lian opened his eyes, an invisible pressure emanating from him.

"Fourth Level Blood Essence!"

Feeling the pressure from Chih Lian, Mo Qingyun's eyes lit up with joy.

Ordinary people could only reach two levels of essence when breaking through to the Nascent Soul realm.

But Chih Lian, just after breaking through, had reached four levels of essence.

This was truly unbelievable.

Thinking about Chih Lian being a reincarnated expert, Mo Qingyun felt relieved.

"Let's go,"

Nodding to Chih Lian, Mo Qingyun walked ahead.

Chih Lian followed without delay.

As they continued their journey, they entered the forest's depths.

After several hours, Mo Qingyun frowned as he felt lost in the endless forest.

At this moment, a sound of battle reached his ears.

"There are people over there!"

Mo Qingyun moved towards the source of the sound.

"Junior Sister, be careful!"

Soon, Mo Qingyun heard several voices and saw figures moving in the forest.

Through the gaps between trees, he saw a few young men in their twenties fighting a black giant tiger.

"A Tiger Illusion with strength comparable to True Qi Seventh Level!"

Mo Qingyun's expression changed as he recognized the tiger.

Although this Tiger Illusion was only at True Qi Seventh Level, with its exceptional agility and robust physique, it had completely suppressed the young men.

In fact, these young men were not weak; they all had True Qi Sixth and Seventh Level strength.

But when fighting the Tiger Illusion, they held back and were cautious of each other, reducing their effectiveness.

Soon, one of them was injured.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun hesitated for a moment before deciding to help.

He knew that if he didn't intervene, these young men would soon be killed by the Tiger Illusion.

Lost in this forest, encountering a few living people was an opportunity to get directions. He couldn't let them die.

Then, Mo Qingyun struck the Tiger Illusion without hesitation.

Ninefold Collapse

Mo Qingyun punched out, nine True Qi fist shadows rapidly landing on the Tiger Illusion.

Bang bang bang...

Under Mo Qingyun's punch, the Tiger Illusion was knocked back and fell heavily.

Furnace Sun Mountain-Splitting Saber

Before the Tiger Illusion could get up, Mo Qingyun slashed with his palm.

A three-meter-long True Qi saber formed and fiercely struck the Tiger Illusion.

Puchi!

As the True Qi saber fell, the Tiger Illusion's head was severed, instantly dead.

Two moves! The True Qi Seventh Level Tiger Illusion is dead!

"Such powerful martial techniques!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun's actions, the young men were shocked.

In addition to shock, there was envy and jealousy. If they had such powerful martial techniques, they wouldn't have been so passive.

"Thank you for your help,"

After a brief moment of shock, they thanked Mo Qingyun.

"No need to mention it!"

Mo Qingyun waved his hand and asked: "Where is Springyang City?"

"Do you want to go to Springyang City?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, the young men were slightly surprised.

"Yes," Mo Qingyun nodded.

"We are also heading to Springyang City. Our senior brother is nearby and will be here soon, so we can go together. If you don't mind, come with us,"

One of the young men invited Mo Qingyun.

"There are many beasts in this forest. I suggest you join us,"

"Alright then."

Seeing their invitation, Mo Qingyun agreed without hesitation.

With them leading the way, it would be easier for him.

Then, Mo Qingyun and Chih Lian waited with the young men for their senior brother to arrive.

"Brother, I'm Luo Yu. These are my junior brothers and sisters,"

After a moment, the eldest among them asked Mo Qingyun: "What are your names?"

"Mo Qingyun," Mo Qingyun said calmly.

As for Chih Lian, he was hidden in a cloak and didn't speak.

Seeing Chih Lian silent, the young men felt slightly awkward but didn't ask further.

Swoosh...

As Mo Qingyun and the young men talked, a rustling sound came from nearby.

Then, several figures quickly appeared in front of them through the swaying branches.

These were Luo Yu's senior brothers.

Seeing their seniors arrive, Luo Yu and the others were delighted: "Senior Brother Yueyin, you're here."

"Ah! We came as soon as we saw your distress signal,"

Yueyin said coldly, then looked at Mo Qingyun and Chih Lian: "Who are they?"

These seniors were not weak, all at True Essence Eighth and Ninth Level. Yueyin was even at half-step Nascent Soul.

"This is Mo Qingyun, and the other one is his butler,"

Luo Yu introduced: "Mo Qingyun saved us from the Tiger Illusion."

"Oh?"

Hearing Luo Yu's words, Yueyin's expression changed with surprise: "A True Qi Fourth Level person could save you from the Tiger Illusion. Mo Qingyun must be quite extraordinary."

"Senior Brother Yueyin, you don't know that Mo Qingyun has a very powerful martial technique,"

Luo Yu said with a cunning smile: "Coincidentally, the martial technique Mo Qingyun used is very similar to what our sect lost. Isn't that a coincidence?"

"Hmm?"

Hearing Luo Yu's words, Mo Qingyun and Yueyin were slightly surprised.

Mo Qingyun could tell that Luo Yu had ulterior motives.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun looked at Luo Yu disdainfully: "Such ingratitude and greed."

"Brother, is this true?"

Yueyin asked coldly.

"Do you believe me if I say it's not?" Mo Qingyun said with a playful smile.

"I hope it is a misunderstanding,"

Yueyin said coldly: "Let's go to the sect. If it is a misunderstanding, we will let you leave."

"What if I don't go?"

Mo Qingyun said with a playful smile.

"Then we will have to force you,"

Seeing Mo Qingyun's refusal, Yueyin and the others' expressions darkened.

Chapter 106: You Should Die!

"Planning to fight?"

Seeing Yueyin's group, Mo Qingyun smiled: "Do you treat your saviors like this?"

"Brother, you saved our lives. We are grateful, but you have something you shouldn't,"

Luo Yu said with a cold smile: "If you give me the martial technique, I will ask Senior Brother Yueyin to spare your life."

"Brother?"

Mo Qingyun looked at Luo Yu with disdain: "You are not worthy to be my brother. Don't insult the word 'brother.'"

"Youngster, don't give face,"

Luo Yu said angrily: "Tell you the truth, Senior Brother Yueyin is a half-step Nascent Soul with one level of Water Essence. He can crush you like an ant."

"Is that so?"

Mo Qingyun narrowed his eyes and looked at Luo Yu with a mocking smile.

"I advise you to give up the martial technique,"

Luo Yu said smugly: "It's not worth losing your life for a martial technique."

"You are right. It is not worth losing one's life for a martial technique,"

Mo Qingyun said coldly.

Hearing this, Luo Yu was delighted: "So you will give up the martial technique?"

"No,"

Mo Qingyun said coldly: "I mean, you are not worth losing your lives for a martial technique."

"You will lose your lives?"

Luo Yu said smugly.

"Junior, although you are strong, do you think you can resist Senior Brother Yueyin and the others?"

Mo Qingyun didn't pay attention to Luo Yu's words, turning to Chih Lian: "One of you can lead the way. The rest should be dealt with."

"Yes, Master!"

Chih Lian nodded.

"I will handle these people,"

Mo Qingyun pointed at Luo Yu and the others, instructing Chih Lian.

"Alright,"

Chih Lian nodded and charged at Yueyin and the others.

As Chih Lian spoke, his aura surged.

"Youngster, you are really reckless to dare to fight..."

Luo Yu said with a mocking smile.

But his words were cut short as he felt Chih Lian's terrifying aura.

Nascent Soul!

Chih Lian's aura was that of a Nascent Soul realm expert.

So the person in the cloak beside Mo Qingyun is a Nascent Soul expert.

Seeing this, Yueyin and the others were shocked, their faces pale.

They were threatening a Nascent Soul expert.

Before they could think further, Chih Lian was already in front of them and attacked.

"Senior, please be kind!"

Yueyin and the others pleaded with a bitter expression.

But Chih Lian ignored their pleas, attacking mercilessly.

Soon, one of the True Essence Seventh Level experts was killed by Chih Lian's palm.

Fourth Level Essence!

Seeing Chih Lian's powerful strike, Yueyin was terrified and his face turned ashen.

He cursed Luo Yu in his heart. If not for him, they wouldn't have provoked Chih Lian.

To understand four levels of essence at Nascent Soul First Level is extremely rare, even for some Nascent Soul Third Level experts.

But Chih Lian, at Nascent Soul First Level, had understood four levels of essence.

What a terrifying talent!

They provoked such a person!

At this moment, Yueyin and the others were stunned.

"You... you have a Nascent Soul expert beside you!"

Seeing one of them severely injured by Chih Lian, Luo Yu was alarmed.

"Wait until you are down there and you will know,"

Mo Qingyun said coldly, then attacked Luo Yu and the others.

Blood Fury!

Facing Luo Yu's group, Mo Qingyun didn't hesitate to use his martial soul technique.

Then, his cultivation rapidly increased, reaching True Qi Seventh Level in an instant.

True Qi Seventh Level!

Seeing Mo Qingyun's aura, Luo Yu and the others turned ashen.
