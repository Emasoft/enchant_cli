Upon hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Yu Qianyi’s expression changed again. He looked at Mo Qingyun carefully, trying to find something extraordinary about him.

After a thorough observation, he failed. Mo Qingyun was only slightly more arrogant in his tone of voice and had nothing else particularly remarkable about him. Then, Yu Qianyi replied, “I will convey your words.”

At that moment, as Mo Qingyun was speaking, a sound of galloping hooves came from outside Lianyun City.

Following this sound, an overwhelming aura rapidly pressed towards the Jade Mansion.

Upon noticing this, everyone’s expressions changed. They felt a bit uneasy.

"Our Du family has arrived; Mo family members, come out to face death!"

At this moment, when everyone felt uneasy, a domineering voice came from outside the Seven Stars Killing Array.

The Du family had arrived!

The real Du family had arrived!

Upon this discovery, everyone’s expressions became solemn. This moment finally came.

Seeing the Du family members outside the Seven Stars Killing Array, Yu Qianyi’s expression turned cold. He asked Mo Qingyun, “Do you need me to take action?”

"No, just some insignificant pests!"

Hearing Yu Qianyi’s words, Mo Qingyun waved his hand and declined. He then said, "If you take action against the Du family, it would violate the regulations of the State Domain. Even the Xuan Yue Palace cannot protect you."

"You actually know about the State Domain?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Yu Qianyi’s expression changed. A wave of shock surged in his heart as he exclaimed, "Who… who are you? With your Mo family’s third-generation status, it is impossible for you to know about the State Domain."

The State Domain was where true powerhouses resided. Even the Xuan Yue Palace seemed insignificant there.

"I am who I am; currently, you do not have the qualifications to know."

Mo Qingyun replied to Yu Qianyi with a faint smile, glancing at him. He then said, "When the time is right, you will naturally know."

Upon hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Yu Qianyi fell silent. However, he did not continue to inquire.

With his experience, he could tell that Mo Qingyun’s words contained a hint of taboo, something beyond his reach.

Thus, he became even more curious and cautious about Mo Qingyun’s identity.

Chapter 166: Array Slaying Half-Step Pill Mansion ()

Bang!

A loud sound came from the Seven Stars Killing Array. The Du family members outside began to break through the array.

Compared to Luo Yuan’s attack earlier, the Du family members caused much less commotion.

"One Pill Mansion Realm Second Level, three Pill Mansion Realm First Level, four half-step Pill Mansion Realms, and dozens of Nascent Soul realms."

When the Du family attacked the Seven Stars Killing Array, Mo Qingyun sensed their strength and smiled sardonically. "To deal with us, the Du family dispatched such a lineup; they truly hold us in high regard."

After smiling faintly, Mo Qingyun looked at Wan Lianyun and the others. He instructed, "City Lord Wan, enter the array. I will lure them in and close the door to fight dogs!"

"Alright!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Wan Lianyun and the others responded. They entered the array to control it.

As Wan Lianyun and the others entered, the aura of the Seven Stars Killing Array surged significantly. It emitted a sharp aura.

Open!

Seeing Wan Lianyun and the others in position, Mo Qingyun raised his hand to form a seal and struck it into the void.

Following this, the Seven Stars Killing Array opened up a gap.

Near the array’s opening, a half-step Pill Mansion Realm elder from the Du family sneered. "They opened up the array; they are courting death!"

With that, this half-step Pill Mansion Realm Du family elder moved and charged into the Seven Stars Killing Array.

Close!

Seeing this Du family elder enter the Seven Stars Killing Array, Mo Qingyun quickly formed another seal and struck it into the void.

Instantly, the gap that had been opened closed up again.

"City Lord Wan, control the array to slay enemies!"

As he healed the array, Mo Qingyun instructed Wan Lianyun and the others to take action.

"Alright!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s instructions, Wan Lianyun and the others responded. They no longer hesitated and began to channel Nascent Soul energy into the Seven Stars Killing Array, controlling its sword qi to strike at the Du family’s half-step Pill Mansion Realm elder.

Whoosh whoosh whoosh…

Under their control, the sword qi streaked out with a whistling sound towards the Du family elder.

"Good… such powerful sword qi! There is such strong sword qi in this array!"

Seeing dozens of sword qi streaks comparable to a half-step Pill Mansion Realm’s full-power strike, the Du family elder’s expression changed. A wave of panic rose in his heart.

It seemed he had been overconfident this time.

"Retreat!"

Upon realizing this, the Du family elder’s mind was filled with thoughts of escape.

He knew that such a multitude of sword qi streaks comparable to a half-step Pill Mansion Realm’s full-power strike was not something he could handle.

Then, this Du family elder fled from the Seven Stars Killing Array. He raised his hand and struck at it, attempting to break through the array.

"From outside, we cannot break it; from inside, it should be simpler."

At this moment, the Du family elder thought to himself and snorted. "Open for me!"

Pang!

However, unexpectedly, under his palm strike, the Seven Stars Killing Array barely moved.

Upon noticing this, the Du family elder’s expression changed. A look of panic appeared on his face as he exclaimed, "Bad! The stability inside the array is even stronger than outside. With my cultivation level, I cannot break it."

Before he knew it, the sword qi from the Seven Stars Killing Array was already approaching him.

Seeing this, the Du family elder raised his hand and struck at the sword qi.

Golden Wheel Mountain Splitting Palm

Seeing the approaching sword qi, the Du family elder wildly swung his palms, unleashing a series of golden wheel-like palm shadows.

Clang clang clang…

As the golden wheel palm shadows collided with the sword qi, it sounded like a clash of thousands of soldiers.

At this moment, outside the Seven Stars Killing Array.

"Not good! Elder Zimin is in danger!"

Seeing this, a Pill Mansion Realm Second Level Du family member’s expression changed. He angrily said, "This deceitful fellow used the lure tactic to trick Elder Zimin into the array and intends to use the array against him."

A Pill Mansion Realm First Level Du family elder was also anxious. He asked, "What should we do now? This array is too solid; in a short time, we cannot break it."

Although the Du family was powerful, losing a half-step Pill Mansion Realm powerhouse was a painful thing for them.

"Exert all our strength and break the array as quickly as possible to rescue Elder Zimin!"

After saying this, he wildly attacked the Seven Stars Killing Array.

Bang bang bang…

Outside the Seven Stars Killing Array, under the Du family’s frenzied attacks, a series of loud sounds echoed.

At the same time, powerful counterforces surged outwards in all directions.

Puff puff puff…

Under this counterforce, some weaker cultivators were directly blown away and spat out blood.

For a moment, the scene became chaotic.

Seeing the Du family’s actions outside the Seven Stars Killing Array, Mo Qingyun smiled sardonically. He looked at Elder Zimin inside the array and coldly said, "They cannot save you; just stay put."

Soul Heaven Seal

After saying this, Mo Qingyun summoned twenty-seven Soul Heaven Seals and struck them at Elder Zimin.

Since the previous Soul Heaven Seals had been used against Luo Yuan, these were temporarily condensed and slightly weaker.

But even so, they were sufficient to deal with Elder Zimin. After all, his cultivation level was not as high as Luo Yuan’s.

Puff puff puff…

Facing the Soul Heaven Seals, Elder Zimin immediately suffered a severe soul injury and his consciousness became hazy.

While Elder Zimin’s consciousness was hazy, Wan Lianyun controlled the array sword qi and struck him.

Psh psh psh…

Facing the sword qi, Elder Zimin was instantly blown apart. Wounds appeared on his body.

"You… you…"

Under the barrage of sword qi comparable to a half-step Pill Mansion Realm’s full-power strike, Elder Zimin was instantly killed. With a look of resentment, he looked at Mo Qingyun and the others but could no longer speak.

Then, Elder Zimin’s body fell to the ground, dying with resentment.

"Elder Zimin…"

Seeing Elder Zimin killed, outside the Du family members went wild. They roared loudly.

Unfortunately, inside the Seven Stars Killing Array, Elder Zimin could no longer hear them.

"Mo family scoundrels, you will not have a good death. If you dare, come out and fight me!"

"You bunch of turtles hiding in the array; what skill is that?"

"Once we break this array, we will definitely tear your Mo family apart and scatter their remains in the wilderness!"

…

At this moment, the Du family members roared at the Jade Mansion.

They could not accept that they came with great strength, intending to wipe out the Mo family.

But in the end, not only did they fail to kill anyone from the Mo family, but they were also killed by a half-step Pill Mansion Realm elder.

This was too humiliating for them.

Regarding the Du family’s frenzied actions outside, Mo Qingyun paid no heed. He walked towards Elder Zimin’s body and thought to himself, "With the blood from this half-step Pill Mansion Realm elder’s body, Quan Lian’s cultivation should recover faster."

With this thought in mind, Mo Qingyun put Elder Zimin’s body into his spatial bag and headed towards Quan Lian’s residence.

Before leaving, Mo Qingyun instructed Wan Lianyun and the others. "City Lord Wan, continue guarding here; I will leave for a while."

"Alright!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s instructions, Wan Lianyun and the others nodded.

Chapter 167: Perfecting the Array (Second Update)

After a short while, Mo Qingyun arrived at Quan Lian’s residence.

Upon arriving, he greeted Du Luo and the others before entering Quan Lian’s room.

With the help of the Two Instruments Breaking Realm Pill, Quan Lian’s injuries had recovered somewhat. His aura was now comparable to a Nascent Soul Realm.

"Young Master, you’re here."

Seeing Mo Qingyun arrive, Quan Lian stopped refining the Two Instruments Breaking Realm Pill and greeted him.

"Hmm!"

Mo Qingyun nodded in response. He took out Elder Zimin’s body and placed it before Quan Lian, saying, "With this person’s blood, your cultivation should recover faster."

"Half-step Pill Mansion Realm powerhouse corpse…"

Seeing Elder Zimin’s body, Quan Lian’s expression changed. He revealed a look of surprise and said, "With this person’s blood and the Two Instruments Breaking Realm Pill’s help, my injuries will definitely be healed within five days."

"Good!"

Hearing Quan Lian’s response, Mo Qingyun nodded in satisfaction.

Then, he gave a few instructions and left Quan Lian’s room.

After leaving the room, Mo Qingyun briefly conversed with Du Luo and the others before returning to the council hall.

When he arrived, the Du family members were still attacking the Seven Stars Killing Array with little effect.

"Let them keep bombarding the array like flies; this cannot continue. We need to come up with a plan."

Seeing the Du family members continuously attacking the array, Mo Qingyun frowned and pondered over a strategy.

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Yu Qianyi also frowned and said solemnly, "Although this array has formidable defense, its offensive power is somewhat weaker. If it had more attack capabilities, that would be even better."

"Due to the lack of array materials, the current Seven Stars Killing Array’s materials are substitutes. Thus, it cannot fully unleash its power."

Mo Qingyun responded solemnly to Yu Qianyi. "Moreover, City Lord Wan’s cultivation level is only half-step Pill Mansion Realm, which further weakens the array’s power."

"So that's how it is!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Yu Qianyi nodded in understanding. He paused and said, "So the stronger the cultivator who sets up the array, the more powerful it will be?"

"That’s right!"

Hearing Yu Qianyi’s words, Mo Qingyun suddenly brightened and looked at him. "You made me remember that there’s a Pill Mansion Realm Eighth Level powerhouse standing beside you. If you help perfect the array, it should increase its power by several levels."

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Yu Qianyi looked curious and asked, "Can an already set array be perfected?"

"Of course!" Mo Qingyun nodded.

"So let’s not waste time and start perfecting the array."

Seeing Mo Qingyun speak, Yu Qianyi’s eyes lit up. He smiled faintly and said, "Increasing the array’s power will allow me to feel at ease taking Princess Ling with me to Xuan Yue Palace."

"Alright!" Mo Qingyun nodded.

Then, Mo Qingyun and Yu Qianyi began to perfect the Seven Stars Killing Array together.

During this process, Mo Qingyun learned from Yu Qianyi that he had two materials to complete the Seven Stars Killing Array. He took them and refined them into the array.

With these materials added, the Seven Stars Killing Array’s power instantly increased, possessing some of a complete array’s aura.

Several hours later, Mo Qingyun and Yu Qianyi looked satisfied as they stopped their work.

"Now the Seven Stars Killing Array’s power is about one-tenth of a complete array."

Looking at the perfected Seven Stars Killing Array, Mo Qingyun smiled contentedly.

"One-tenth?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Yu Qianyi’s expression changed. A wave of shock surged in his heart.

He could clearly feel that the Seven Stars Killing Array’s power now threatened a Pill Mansion Realm Second Level powerhouse.

Even so, this was only one-tenth of the complete array’s power. One could imagine how powerful a complete Seven Stars Killing Array would be.

As Yu Qianyi was shocked, Mo Qingyun narrowed his eyes and looked at the Du family members outside the array. He smiled faintly and said, "Since the array has been perfected, it’s time to drive away these flies."

Sword Qi Condense!

Mo Qingyun spoke and quickly formed a seal, striking it into the Seven Stars Killing Array.

After this seal was struck, dazzling light burst from the array. Then, sword qi began to condense.

Slash!

Seeing the sword qi condensing, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate. He controlled the sword qi and struck it at the Du family members outside.

Psh psh psh…

Facing this sudden sword qi attack, some lower-level Du family elders were instantly cut in half before they could react.

Seeing this change, the Du family’s Pill Mansion Realm Second Level elder’s expression changed. He shouted at everyone, "Retreat! Quickly retreat!"

Soon, the Du family members retreated from the Seven Stars Killing Array and dared not approach near the Jade Mansion.

"Good job, you ran fast!"

Seeing the Du family members retreat and avoid being struck by the array’s sword qi, Mo Qingyun sneered. He raised his hand and struck another seal into the array.

Under this seal, those sword qi gradually dissipated and returned to the array.

Outside the Seven Stars Killing Array.

Seeing over ten Nascent Soul Realm guest experts killed in an instant, several Du family elders’ eyes bulged.

So hateful, so hateful!

Due to a momentary lapse in judgment, they lost over ten Nascent Soul Realm guest experts without even breaking the Jade Mansion’s array.

This was a great failure and humiliation for them.

Thinking this, the Du family’s Pill Mansion Realm Second Level elder’s expression darkened. He roared at the Jade Mansion, "Mo family turtles, don’t be proud. If you have the guts, stay hidden forever. We will guard this Jade Mansion for three to five years, cutting off your food supply and starving you."

"Qingyun, this…"

Hearing the elder’s words, Mo Hongtian and the others’ expressions changed. A look of concern appeared.

Although they were Nascent Soul Realm, they could go without food and water for months. But three to five years was too long.

Moreover, inside the Jade Mansion were some True Essence Realm and True Qi Realm cultivators, as well as some younger ones.

If they were starved for a year or two, those young ones would likely die of starvation first.

Regarding Mo Hongtian and the others’ thoughts, Mo Qingyun was well aware. He smiled faintly at them and said, "Don’t worry; I have a plan to deal with the Du family’s actions."

Seeing Mo Qingyun speak like this, the Mo family members did not say more. They believed that he had a plan.

After many previous events, they unconsciously developed an inexplicable trust in Mo Qingyun.

"Let’s go inside; the Du family just suffered a loss and won’t dare attack the array for some time."

Mo Qingyun waved at everyone, signaling them to return to the council hall.

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, they nodded and headed towards the council hall.

Chapter 168: You Are Mo Family’s Rescue Force (Third Update)

Three days later.

Perhaps because the array displayed its offensive power, the Du family members were wary and kept a distance from the Jade Mansion.

Thus, a stalemate formed between them. It was about who would give up first.

Mo Qingyun and the others were content with this, enjoying a bit of peace.

At that moment, outside the Jade Mansion’s council hall, everyone wore expressions of reluctance.

Because at this time, Mo Ling was leaving with Yu Qianyi.

"Mother, Ling is leaving."

Mo Ling embraced her mother Mo Yue Ru tightly. Tears welled up in her eyes as she said, "Mother, once I solve my body’s problem, I will come back to see you."

"Alright, alright!"

Hearing this, Mo Yue Ru nodded with a smile. She comforted her daughter, "Take care of yourself when you’re away from me."

As Mo Yue Ru and Mo Ling talked, Mo Qingyun looked at Yu Qianyi seriously. He asked, "When will you return from Xuan Yue Palace? Don’t leave Auntie for another twenty years."

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Mo Yue Ru looked at him gratefully. He had expressed her thoughts.

Then she looked expectantly at Yu Qianyi.

Seeing everyone looking at him, Yu Qianyi replied seriously. "After I escort Princess Ling back to Xuan Yue Palace, I will return immediately. It might take half a year or a year."

"Alright!" Mo Qingyun nodded in satisfaction.

After that, they talked for a while. Then Yu Qianyi took Mo Ling and flew out of the Jade Mansion.

Outside the Jade Mansion.

Seeing Yu Qianyi and Mo Ling emerge, a Du family member’s expression changed. He said to the Pill Mansion Realm Second Level elder, "Elder Wanguan, someone is leaving from the Jade Mansion."

"Hmph! Finally decided to come out."

Hearing his companion’s words, Du Wanguan’s expression darkened. He moved towards Yu Qianyi and Mo Ling.

Soon, Du Wanguan and the others blocked their path. They sneered, "We thought you would hide in the Jade Mansion forever like turtles."

"The Du family has blocked Ling’s path!"

Seeing the Du family members’ actions, everyone inside the Jade Mansion’s expressions changed. They looked somewhat complex.

With Yu Qianyi’s cultivation level, they were not worried about Mo Ling and her safety. They felt a bit sympathetic for the Du family.

If they knew that they had blocked a Pill Mansion Realm Eighth Level powerhouse’s path, what would their thoughts be?

As Mo Qingyun and the others pondered this, Du Wanguan sneered at Yu Qianyi. "Sir, you are Mo family’s hired help?"

"Mo family’s hired help?"

Hearing Du Wanguan’s words, Yu Qianyi was taken aback. He looked at him and the others curiously.

These Du family members considered him Mo family’s hired help, a result that made him somewhat amused and exasperated.

If he were Mo family’s hired help, with the Du family’s strength, they would have been wiped out long ago.

"Sir, your cultivation to the Pill Mansion Realm is not easy. Don’t make a mistake."

Du Wanguan looked haughty and said with a hint of threat, "Our Du family values talent. If you switch sides now and swear to serve our Du family for a hundred years, we can give you an elder position with generous benefits."

"Elder position, generous benefits?"

Hearing Du Wanguan’s words, even Mo Ling looked puzzled. She stared at him with a look of amusement.

Was he trying to recruit Yu Qianyi?

She didn’t know whether to call them fools or foolish.

Seeing Mo Ling’s expression, the Du family members’ expressions darkened. They glared at her.

"Little brat, what kind of look is that? Do you believe we won’t gouge out your eyes?"

"Grand Elder Gu Yu, you’re too brutal. How can you be so heartless to such a pretty girl?"

"Haha, I was just thinking of finding someone new for myself. This little brat seems suitable."

…

For a moment, the Du family elders’ eyes gleamed as they leered at Mo Ling.

Hearing their words, Yu Qianyi’s expression darkened. He said coldly, "Get out! Otherwise, die!"

As Yu Qianyi spoke, he released his Pill Mansion Realm Eighth Level aura towards the Du family members.

Under Yu Qianyi’s aura, the Du family members’ expressions changed. They looked at him with fear.

Puff puff puff…

At the same time, they were all struck by his powerful aura and spat blood.

Pill Mansion High Level!

At this moment, the Du family members’ minds went blank. They lost their ability to think.

This person was actually a Pill Mansion High Level powerhouse! They had threatened him; they were courting death!

"Mercy, mercy, we’ll leave!"

After a brief moment of daze, they all looked at Yu Qianyi with fear and begged for mercy.

Yu Qianyi’s expression was cold. He said, "Get out! Don’t let me see you again."

"Yes, yes!"

Then the Du family members fled like dogs with their tails between their legs.

Seeing them leave, Yu Qianyi’s eyes gleamed coldly. He hesitated for a moment before taking Mo Ling away.

"It’s a pity; if Qianyi had killed the Du family members, it would have been better."

Seeing Yu Qianyi let them go, everyone inside the Jade Mansion felt a bit regretful.

As Mo Qingyun saw Yu Qianyi leave, his brows furrowed. His expression changed slightly as he thought, "I hope Yu Qianyi is fine when he returns from Xuan Yue Palace."

At that moment, a terrifying aura suddenly erupted inside the Jade Mansion as Yu Qianyi left.

Pill Mansion Realm aura!

Someone’s cultivation had broken through to the Pill Mansion Realm inside the Jade Mansion!

Upon noticing this, everyone’s expressions changed. A wave of shock surged in their hearts.

While shocked, they also wondered who had broken through to the Pill Mansion Realm?

Currently in the Jade Mansion, only Quan Lian and Wan Lianyun were at half-step Pill Mansion Realm. They had the potential to break through.

But Quan Lian was severely injured, and Wan Lianyun was in everyone’s sight.

So who had broken through to the Pill Mansion Realm?

"Could it be that Grand Elder Du Luo broke through?"

"Or could it be Old Senior Zhao Qiyuan?"

…

Everyone speculated.

As everyone pondered, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly. He said in surprise, "Unexpectedly, Quan Lian broke through to the Pill Mansion Realm due to his misfortune."

What?

Quan Lian had broken through to the Pill Mansion Realm!

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, everyone was surprised. They were taken aback by this result.

They never imagined that the one who broke through to the Pill Mansion Realm would be severely injured Quan Lian.

Knowing that Quan Lian had broken through, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate. He headed towards Quan Lian’s residence.

Seeing his actions, the others followed him without hesitation.

After a short while, they arrived at Quan Lian’s courtyard.

At this moment, everyone could clearly sense the terrifying Nascent Soul energy fluctuations from Quan Lian’s room.

"Grandmaster Quan not only recovered but also broke through to the Pill Mansion Realm. That’s great!"

"From now on, we will have more confidence in fighting the Du family."

"Yes, with Grandmaster Quan’s realm, once he breaks through to the Pill Mansion Realm, even a second-level Pill Mansion Realm has a chance."

…

Everyone was excited and exclaimed.

As everyone was excited, Mo Qingyun looked thoughtful. He planned silently.

Chapter 169: Returning to Lianyun City (Fourth Update, Extra Chapter)

Half an hour later, Quan Lian stopped his cultivation and opened his eyes with a look of joy.

He did not expect that by refining Du Zimin’s blood and with the help of the Two Instruments Breaking Realm Pill, his cultivation broke through to the Pill Mansion Realm.

Although there was only a step between half-step Pill Mansion and full Pill Mansion, the difference was vast.

Now his strength had increased by several times compared to before.

Quan Lian walked out of the room and saw Mo Qingyun outside. He immediately bowed in gratitude, "Thank you Young Master for the Two Instruments Breaking Realm Pill!"

Feeling Quan Lian’s Pill Mansion aura, Wan Lianyun looked at him with a hint of envy.

He was also at half-step Pill Mansion Realm. If he had the Two Instruments Breaking Realm Pill, perhaps his cultivation would have broken through.

After looking at Quan Lian with envy, Wan Lianyun frowned and said to Mo Qingyun, "Young Master Mo, now that the Du family has left, should we take this opportunity to gather some food?"

Wan Lianyun continued, "We can gather enough food so that even if the Du family returns, we won’t worry about running out of food and starving to death."

"You’re right. Now that the Du family has left, it’s a good opportunity for us to gather food."

Hearing this, Du Luo and the others nodded in agreement.

"I had that plan too."

Mo Qingyun nodded. "Later, I will leave the Jade Mansion with Quan Lian to gather food around. Everyone stay inside and don’t leave."

"Alright!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, everyone nodded. They also expressed concern for him and Quan Lian.

Then Mo Qingyun instructed Mo Hongtian and the others before leaving with Quan Lian from the Jade Mansion.

After leaving, Mo Qingyun and Quan Lian began to gather food crazily. Anything edible was put into their spatial bags.

One day later.

After Mo Qingyun and Quan Lian’s frenzied gathering, nearly half of the food from over a thousand towns around Lianyun City was collected.

"These foods should be enough for everyone in the Jade Mansion to eat for three to five years."

Seeing his spatial bags full, Mo Qingyun smiled contentedly.

"Now that we have gathered the food, it’s time to return to the Jade Mansion."

Then Mo Qingyun and Quan Lian returned to the Jade Mansion.

"Qingyun, you’re back."

Seeing Mo Qingyun and Quan Lian return, Mo Hongtian and the others smiled. They surrounded them.

"Hmm."

Mo Qingyun nodded in response. He handed all the spatial bags to Mo Hongtian, "Grandfather, these spatial bags are full of food. They should be enough for everyone to eat for three to five years."

"That’s great!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun, everyone smiled. They were excited.

They did not expect that in just one day, Mo Qingyun and Quan Lian had gathered so much food.

After a brief moment of excitement, Du Luo frowned slightly. He said with some worry, "Good disciple, although there’s a lot of food and it should last for three to five years, they won’t stay fresh after that."

"Don’t worry about this. I’ve already thought of it."

Mo Qingyun seemed to have anticipated their question and smiled faintly. "Later, I will set up an ice cellar array and put the food inside to preserve it. Even if stored for ten or eight years, they will still be fresh."

Hearing this, everyone’s faces lit up. Their worries vanished.

Then Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and started setting up the ice cellar array to preserve the food.
