Certainly, here is the translation:

In the current situation, he was not only defending himself but also aiming to defeat Song Chen.

This way, he could take Mo Xiao with him and leave together.

If it were merely for escaping, even facing a Ninth Level Body Refinement cultivator like Mo Qingyun, he would not worry at all.

But to defeat the other party head-on, although Song Chen was only a Seventh Level Body Refinement cultivator, there was still considerable pressure.

Bang!

When Mo Qingyun and Song Chen clashed, a loud sound immediately erupted.

Following this, the bodies of Mo Qingyun and Song Chen began to retreat rapidly.

"Quite some skill!"

Seeing that his full-strength attack did not subdue Mo Qingyun, Song Chen's expression turned even colder as he coldly said, "You could push me to this point; you should feel honored even in death."

"Tiger Soul of Sword麟, come forth!"

With Song Chen's loud shout, a huge green tiger shadow appeared above him, exuding powerful aura.

This was an Eighth Level Soul Beast, the Tiger Soul of Sword麟. It was unexpected that Song Chen's soul beast was so powerful.

Once the Tiger Soul of Sword麟 appeared, it immediately released a surge of soul energy that affected Song Chen.

Under this influence, the aura around Song Chen rose several notches, reaching a level comparable to an Eighth Level Body Refinement cultivator.

Feeling the power brought by his soul beast, Song Chen's face revealed a cruel smile as he coldly said to Mo Qingyun, "Boy, prepare for your death."

On the side, when Mo Xiao sensed Song Chen's powerful aura, her face turned pale and she showed a hint of panic. She shouted at Mo Qingyun, "Qingyun, you must leave quickly; don't worry about me."

"Is the Tiger Soul of Sword麟 very powerful?"

At this moment, when Mo Xiao was worried, Mo Qingyun looked at Song Chen's Tiger Soul of Sword麟 and replied disdainfully.

Then, Mo Qingyun revealed a proud expression and summoned his own soul beast.

"Fiery Azure Dragon, come forth!"

As Mo Qingyun spoke, a huge red figure appeared above him, a dragon shadow several meters long.

The red dragon shadow immediately attacked the Tiger Soul of Sword麟 and swallowed it in an instant.

Swallowed!

Song Chen's Tiger Soul of Sword麟 was swallowed by the red figure.

How could this be possible?

Seeing this scene, Mo Xiao and her companions were stunned.

The current scene had exceeded their understanding of soul beasts.

Soul beasts could actually be swallowed!

"Am I not mistaken? Song Chen's soul beast was swallowed!"

Looking at the awe-inspiring red dragon shadow, Mo Xiao had a look of shock on her face as she kept nodding in disbelief.

"Also, is that red dragon shadow Mo Qingyun's soul beast?"

At this moment, Mo Xiao found it hard to believe that the so-called waste of the Mo family with only a First Level soul beast, Mo Qingyun.

His soul beast was so powerful and domineering after being released!

If this scene were known by the elders of Mo family, it would surely shock many people.

"Mo Qingyun's soul beast is so powerful!"

Recalling the performance of the Fiery Azure Dragon Soul Beast, Mo Xiao was excited and clenched her fists.

"Dragon Clan soul beast! This boy's soul beast is a Dragon Clan soul beast!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun's soul beast, not only did Mo Xiao look incredulous but so did Song Chen and Song Hui.

Dragon Clan soul beasts were among the most powerful on the Heavenly Soul Continent.

Even the weakest sub-dragon clan soul beast was at least a Ninth Level soul beast. Mo Qingyun's Fiery Azure Dragon Soul Beast clearly wasn't a sub-dragon clan soul beast.

Thus, Mo Qingyun's soul beast was at least a Tenth Level or even higher than that.

"Puh!"

Soul beasts were the essence of martial artists. After being swallowed, Song Chen spat out a mouthful of blood and his complexion turned pale.

Mo Qingyun glanced at Song Chen with a cold tone, "Now, can you still crush my crotch?"

"Boy, don't be too much. I am a direct descendant of the Song family; my elder brother is the first genius of the Song family, Song Zihao."

Seeing Mo Qingyun approaching, Song Chen looked at him with awe and said in a panic, "If you dare to touch me, the Song family and my elder brother won't let you off."

"Direct descendant of the Song family? Brother of Song Zihao?"

Hearing this, Mo Qingyun's expression changed slightly. He was somewhat surprised by Song Chen's identity.

However, this made him more determined to kill Song Chen and his companions. He said with a playful smile, "Are you threatening me?"

After Mo Qingyun summoned his soul beast, he did not plan to leave Song Chen and his companions alive.

Currently, he didn't want others to know about his Fiery Azure Dragon Soul Beast. Therefore, these people could not be left alive.

Now that he knew Song Chen was actually Song Zihao's brother, Mo Qingyun naturally couldn't leave him alive.

Song Chen was unaware of Mo Qingyun's thoughts. He thought that Mo Qingyun was intimidated by his identity.

"Now, do you know to be afraid?"

Then, Song Chen said smugly, "Boy, I see your potential is good. If you now bow and apologize to me, give that woman to me for enjoyment, swear to become my Song family's slave from now on, I can recommend you to my elder brother..."

At this moment, while Song Chen was speaking smugly, Mo Qingyun showed a look of impatience.

He let the Fiery Azure Dragon Soul Beast exhale a fiery dragon breath, sweeping towards Song Chen.

"Boy, you..."

Seeing Mo Qingyun's action, Song Chen's expression changed instantly. He was shocked by Mo Qingyun's move.

He did not expect that after knowing his identity, Mo Qingyun would still dare to attack him like this.

Under the Fiery Azure Dragon Soul Beast's dragon breath, Song Chen was almost unresponsive and turned to ashes instantly.

"You... You killed Brother Song Chen!"

Seeing Song Chen turn into ashes under the dragon breath, Song Hui said in fear.

But before he finished speaking, Mo Qingyun let the Fiery Azure Dragon exhale a dragon breath towards him.

Then, Song Hui followed in his brother's footsteps and turned to ashes under the dragon breath.

Subsequently, Mo Qingyun let the Fiery Azure Dragon exhale a dragon breath and burned Song Lei and Song Zheng to ashes.

After doing all this, Mo Qingyun recalled the Fiery Azure Dragon Soul Beast and walked towards Mo Xiao who was already stunned.

"Xiao Xiao, let's go!"

Reaching Mo Xiao's side, Mo Qingyun said with a faint smile.

"Ah!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, Mo Xiao shivered and looked at him with awe before nodding in agreement.

At this moment, the feeling Mo Qingyun gave her seemed to have become unfamiliar.

The current Mo Qingyun was vastly different from the one she remembered.

In her impression, Mo Qingyun's soul beast should have been negligible.

But now, his soul beast had reached a bizarrely powerful level.

Swallowing others' soul beasts and exhaling dragon breath to turn them into ashes, was this still a soul beast?

Could soul beasts be used like this?

Even a powerful dragon demon seemed no different.

Mo Qingyun's current performance had completely shattered her understanding of soul beasts.

Seeing Mo Xiao's expression, Mo Qingyun quickly guessed that she was shocked by his Fiery Azure Dragon Soul Beast.

He then said with a smile, "Xiao Xiao, I hope you can keep my soul beast secret."

"Okay! I won't tell others." Mo Xiao nodded in agreement.

When Mo Qingyun mentioned his soul beast, Mo Xiao felt some doubts and asked, "Qingyun, isn't your soul beast a First Level Lighting Soul Beast?"

Mo Qingyun did not directly answer Mo Xiao's doubts but summoned both soul beasts.

Then, two images appeared on his hands: a red dragon shadow and a white light door.

Seeing these two images, Mo Xiao's expression changed instantly. She exclaimed in shock, "Dual soul beasts!"

Mo Qingyun had dual soul beasts, and one of them was a powerful Dragon Clan soul beast.

This revelation made her heart surge with excitement. She stared at Mo Qingyun in disbelief.

Unconsciously, she thought that perhaps no one in the Mo family would have imagined that Mo Qingyun had dual soul beasts.

"Huh!"

After a moment, Mo Xiao took a deep breath to calm her excited heart.

She never imagined that the so-called waste of the Mo family was actually their true first genius.

She could be sure that Mo Qingyun's Fiery Azure Dragon Soul Beast was even more powerful than Mo Cang's Tenth Level Shadow Tiger Soul Beast.

So, wasn't his Dragon Clan soul beast at least a Twelfth Level?

Mo Qingyun had a Twelfth Level soul beast!

This revelation made Mo Xiao dizzy again.

The result was too unexpected and sudden for her.

"But with such talent, why did Mo Qingyun progress so slowly?"

Mo Xiao was puzzled and wondered.

However, she brightened up with an idea.

This must be Mo Qingyun's deliberate act; he was biding his time, waiting for a day to astonish everyone.

It seemed that Mo Qingyun had achieved this goal.

In the previous month's competition, Mo Qingyun's outstanding talent had already caught the attention of family elders.

Mo Xiao was sure that in the next month's competition, Mo Qingyun would surprise everyone and shock them.

"Qingyun, what is your current cultivation level?"

Then, Mo Xiao asked curiously.

"Just broke through to Sixth Level Body Refinement!"

Mo Qingyun replied honestly without hiding anything.

"Sixth Level Body Refinement!"

Although she had guessed Mo Qingyun's cultivation level before, hearing him confirm it made her heart skip a beat.

Mo Qingyun's progress was different from hers.

In the previous month's competition, her cultivation level had already reached peak Fifth Level Body Refinement and she only needed a trigger to break through to Sixth Level.

But Mo Qingyun had just broken through to Fourth Level Body Refinement at that time.

In the past ten days, Mo Qingyun's cultivation level had advanced two levels to Sixth Level Body Refinement.

This rate of progress was quite shocking.

"Whew!"

Thinking this, Mo Xiao involuntarily sucked in a breath. Her gaze towards Mo Qingyun became somewhat strange.

Seeing her reaction, Mo Qingyun was a bit helpless but did not explain much. He said with a faint smile, "Let's go back."

"Okay!"

Mo Xiao nodded and followed Mo Qingyun back to the Mo family.

After returning, Mo Qingyun told Mo Xiao about the situation in his cave.

He planned to share some of the core crystals of earth fire with Mo Xiao.

However, Mo Xiao refused his offer on the grounds that Mo Qingyun's Fiery Azure Dragon Soul Beast absorbed earth fire core crystals better.

Seeing her refusal, Mo Qingyun did not insist. He thought to himself, "Sharing earth fire core crystals with Mo Xiao is indeed less useful; I'll refine some medicinal pills for her another day."

With this thought, he gave Mo Xiao the remaining Body Refinement Pills on him.

Seeing Mo Qingyun give her the Body Refinement Pills, Mo Xiao accepted them happily without refusing.

Then, Mo Qingyun and Mo Xiao returned to their respective homes and focused on cultivation, preparing for the competition in ten days.

In a small courtyard, Mo Qingyun sat cross-legged with his mind focused, fully immersed in cultivation.

At this moment, he summoned the Fiery Azure Dragon Soul Beast.

It absorbed the earth fire core crystals in his hand like a baby suckling milk, crazily absorbing them.

Under the Fiery Azure Dragon Soul Beast's crazy absorption, the earth fire core crystals visibly shrank.

After half a day, one earth fire core crystal was completely absorbed by the Fiery Azure Dragon Soul Beast.

After absorbing an earth fire core crystal, the color of the Fiery Azure Dragon Soul Beast's body became noticeably deeper.

In addition to this, its size slightly increased and its aura also grew stronger.

Of course, Mo Qingyun benefited greatly during the Fiery Azure Dragon Soul Beast's absorption of earth fire core crystals.

After one earth fire core crystal was absorbed by the Fiery Azure Dragon Soul Beast, his cultivation level clearly improved and his physical strength also increased.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun no longer hesitated. He immediately took out another earth fire core crystal for the Fiery Azure Dragon Soul Beast to absorb.

After three days, five earth fire core crystals were absorbed by the Fiery Azure Dragon Soul Beast.

At this moment, the color of the Fiery Azure Dragon Soul Beast's body became even deeper and its size increased from around five meters to seven meters.

Mo Qingyun's cultivation level reached peak Sixth Level Body Refinement at this moment.

After seven days, twelve earth fire core crystals were absorbed by the Fiery Azure Dragon Soul Beast.

The size of the Fiery Azure Dragon increased from seven meters to nine meters.

Mo Qingyun's cultivation level reached peak Sixth Level Body Refinement and advanced to mid-stage Sixth Level Body Refinement.

After thirteen days, all twenty-three earth fire core crystals on Mo Qingyun's body were completely absorbed by the Fiery Azure Dragon Soul Beast.

At this moment, the length of the Fiery Azure Dragon's body reached around twelve meters and its aura was comparable to a True Qi Realm expert.

Mo Qingyun's current cultivation level reached peak Sixth Level Body Refinement, half a step away from Seventh Level Body Refinement.

Moreover, his physical strength had reached an astonishing level. Even compared to a Seventh Level Body Refinement cultivator, he was not inferior.

Now, Mo Qingyun's body had condensed a stream of internal energy. It was just a matter of time before he broke through to Seventh Level Body Refinement.

"Peak Sixth Level Body Refinement!"

After feeling his cultivation level, Mo Qingyun revealed a satisfied smile.

Although he had not immediately broken through to Seventh Level Body Refinement, his current strength was sufficient for the competition tomorrow.

Seeing that it would be the competition tomorrow, Mo Qingyun decided not to continue cultivating.

He wanted to practice his martial techniques 'Swift Shadow Steps' and 'Nine-layer Collapse' during this time, so he could quickly adapt to his current cultivation level.

In the following days, Mo Qingyun repeatedly practiced these martial techniques without tiring of it.

The next day, as the sun rose.

Mo Qingyun heard laughter outside his courtyard. It was several girls talking; Mo Xiao and Mo Xin had arrived.

Then, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate to get up and open the door for them.

"Qingyun, guess who we brought?"

Seeing Mo Qingyun come to open the door, Mo Xiao and Mo Xin smiled mysteriously and asked.

Mo Qingyun was surprised at first but then looked puzzled, "Can't guess!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's answer, Mo Xin and Mo Xiao felt disappointed. They glared at him and said, "No sense of cooperation; you should have guessed."

"Look, who's here."

Mo Xin and Mo Xiao moved aside to reveal the figure behind them.

Then, Mo Qingyun saw a familiar face. It was a girl whose beauty did not lose to Mo Xin.

This girl was also Mo Qingyun's cousin, the daughter of his second aunt, Mo Ling.

At this moment, Mo Ling's face was flushed and she had a slight sweat on her forehead. Her breath seemed somewhat weak.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun's brows furrowed involuntarily. He looked at Mo Ling several times.

Just then, he was startled: "Fiery Phoenix Body. It's the Fiery Phoenix Body ranked eleventh among the three thousand special physiques."

He never expected that Mo Ling's physique was actually the Fiery Phoenix Body. No wonder she looked like this.

The three thousand special physiques were extremely powerful unique physiques, sharing a common characteristic.

They needed to awaken the power of their bloodline before they could show their strength.

Otherwise, not only would they fail to display the power of this physique but also be tormented by it.

Clearly, Mo Ling was suffering from the Fiery Phoenix Body's torment at this moment.

"Cousin Mo Ling, it's you."

Mo Qingyun was surprised first and then smiled faintly. He greeted her, "Come in and sit."

"Smelly boy, why are you so polite to Mo Ling? Is it because she's prettier than us?"

Seeing Mo Qingyun's actions, Mo Xin glared at him playfully and said.

Hearing this, Mo Qingyun's forehead twitched. He smiled bitterly and said, "Cousin Mo Xin, you're wronging me."

"Ha ha, Mo Xin, don't tease Qingyun. He's letting her sit inside because he sees that she has a weak physique."

Mo Ling smiled and explained for Mo Qingyun.

Seeing this, Mo Xin was helpless. She said, "Mo Ling, you're still protecting him."

"Isn't that the same for you?" Mo Ling replied unconsciously.

"Huh!"

Hearing this, Mo Xin was speechless. She said hesitantly, "I... I just couldn't bear to see him beaten up so badly. It's not that I'm protecting this boy."

"Ha ha, is it?"

Mo Ling smiled playfully and asked.

Under Mo Ling's gaze, Mo Xin felt somewhat uncomfortable. She changed the topic and said, "Smelly boy, this is what Second Aunt asked us to bring you. They're all so partial; the first thing they thought of was you."

Then, Mo Xin handed a brocade box to Mo Qingyun. After opening it, he found a set of new clothes inside.

"Quickly change and show us."

Seeing the clothes in the box, Mo Xin and her companions were curious. They urged him to change.

Then, under their gazes, Mo Qingyun went back inside and changed into the new clothes.

"Not bad, not bad. You look much better in these!"

After a moment, seeing Mo Qingyun come out, the girls nodded approvingly.

"Xin sister, Ling sister, the competition is about to start. Let's go to the arena."

Mo Xiao looked at the time and reminded them.

Then, Mo Qingyun and his companions headed towards the arena.

Looking at Mo Ling ahead, Mo Qingyun thought about whether to help her alleviate her pain.

Although he could not awaken the power of her bloodline now, he could still help her alleviate some pain.

After a moment's thought, Mo Qingyun decided to wait until after the competition.

"Have you heard? Mo Hai came out of Wind Returning Valley and his cultivation level broke through to Sixth Level Body Refinement."

"A month ago, he was Fifth Level Body Refinement. He broke through one level in a month; Mo Hai is really strong."

"Mo Hai got some good fortune. Not only did his cultivation level break through, but his martial techniques also improved greatly."

...

On the way to the arena, some young people's conversations reached Mo Qingyun and his companions.

"Smelly boy, Mo Hai is very popular recently. If you meet him in the competition, be careful."

Hearing others' words, Mo Xin reminded Mo Qingyun.

After Mo Xin's words, Mo Xiao looked a bit strange. She glanced at Mo Qingyun playfully.

Mo Xiao knew his true strength very well.

A Sixth Level Body Refinement Mo Hai was not a match for him at all.

But Mo Xiao did not say anything. She just winked at Mo Qingyun and said to him, "Qingyun, don't worry. I have confidence in dealing with Mo Hai."

"Oh! Is that so? You seem very confident."

Hearing this, Mo Xin and Mo Ling's eyes lit up. They said in surprise.

Just as Mo Qingyun was about to speak, several annoying figures approached them.

These were none other than Mo Hai and his few followers.

"Mo Qingyun, you're quite confident. You think you can deal with me? Are you joking?"

After coming to Mo Qingyun, Mo Hai said disdainfully.

Clearly, he had heard what Mo Qingyun just said.

Seeing Mo Hai's arrogant posture, Mo Xin frowned and rolled up her sleeves. "Mo Hai, are you looking for a fight?"

Seeing Mo Xin's posture, Mo Hai's expression twitched. He said in fear, "Mo... Mo Xin, don't be too much. My elder brother is nearby."

In the past, because of bullying Mo Qingyun, Mo Hai had been beaten up by Mo Xin many times. He had a shadow of fear towards her.

He knew that under Mo Xin's gentle appearance, there was a fierce personality.

"Mo Xin, bullying my younger brother is no big deal. If you're brave enough, challenge me in the family competition at year-end."

At this moment, a cold voice came from behind Mo Hai.

The speaker was none other than Mo Hai's elder brother, Mo Cang.

Seeing Mo Cang arrive, Mo Hai smiled and said, "Elder brother, you're here!"

Mo Cang's arrival made Mo Hai feel more confident. He smiled at Mo Xin and said, "Mo Xin, tell you the truth, my elder brother's cultivation level has broken through to Tenth Level Body Refinement. In the family competition at year-end, you'll be defeated by my elder brother."

Tenth Level Body Refinement. Mo Cang's cultivation level had broken through to Tenth Level Body Refinement.

Hearing this, the surrounding people's expressions changed. They looked at Mo Cang with awe.

"Originally broke through to Tenth Level Body Refinement, no wonder you're so arrogant."

Mo Cang's breakthrough made Mo Xin surprised. She looked at him with more caution.

Since Mo Cang's soul beast was stronger than hers, in the same cultivation level, she would be at a disadvantage.

Therefore, it was very difficult for her to defeat Mo Cang in the year-end family competition.

"Not arrogant, just capable of teaching a few arrogant people a lesson."

Mo Cang said coldly and then looked at Mo Qingyun. He smiled, "Soon the competition will start. I'll see how you defeat my younger brother."

Mo Cang's words showed his confidence in Mo Hai.

Of course, it was understandable for him to think this way. After all, last month's competition Mo Qingyun was only Fourth Level Body Refinement.

Moreover, Mo Hai broke through to Sixth Level Body Refinement because he had a great fortune in this month.

Mo Cang did not believe that Mo Qingyun would have such good luck as well.

Therefore, in his view, after this month, Mo Qingyun's cultivation level might have improved but not much. It would not pose a threat to Mo Hai.

"Since you want to see Mo Hai defeated, I'll make your wish come true!"

Mo Qingyun smiled playfully and said.

"Hmph! You're quite confident. But boasting won't help."

Mo Cang replied indifferently.

He did not believe that with Mo Hai's Sixth Level Body Refinement cultivation level, he would be no match for Mo Qingyun.

"Brother Cang, this boy is just stubborn. He'll be beaten by Brother Hai."

"He might not even have Fifth Level Body Refinement cultivation level. That way, he won't participate in the competition for young elites."

"That means he won't meet Brother Hai and won't be beaten by him in the competition."

"He must think this way. That's why he acts so arrogantly. He doesn't even have Fifth Level Body Refinement cultivation level."

...

At this moment, Mo Hai's followers flattered him.

Hearing his follower's words, Mo Hai looked at Mo Qingyun disdainfully and said coldly, "Mo Qingyun, you don't even have Fifth Level Body Refinement cultivation level. I overestimated you; you're not worthy to be my opponent."

"Don't have Fifth Level Body Refinement cultivation level?"

Hearing Mo Hai's words, Mo Qingyun and Mo Xiao smiled playfully.

They were quite impressed by the thoughts of Mo Hai and his followers. It was really hard for them.

But Mo Qingyun did not reveal it, just looked at Mo Hai and said calmly, "You're right. You really don't deserve to be my opponent."

"Sister Xin, Qingyun, let's not argue with them. Let's go to the arena first."

Seeing Mo Qingyun and his opponents facing off, Mo Ling looked at them unhappily. She advised him.

"Okay!"

Seeing Mo Ling speak, Mo Qingyun did not argue with them and walked towards the arena.

Soon, they arrived at the arena.

After arriving, Mo Qingyun saw Mo Feipeng and Mo Yue Ru on the judges' seats.

Seeing them, he greeted them, "Uncle Feipeng, Aunt Yue Ru."

"Months have passed; Qingyun has grown so tall. Does this new set of clothes fit you?"

Seeing Mo Qingyun, Mo Yue Ru smiled affectionately and said.

Then she saw Mo Xiao beside him. She looked at her with fondness, "This is Xiao Xiao, right? The little girl has grown up so gracefully."

"Aunt Yue Ru! You're flattering me,"

Hearing Mo Yue Ru's words, Mo Xiao blushed and called her Aunt Yue Ru.

"Haha!"

Seeing Mo Xiao's reaction, Mo Qingyun and his companions smiled.

Then Mo Feipeng saw Mo Ling beside them. He said to Mo Xin, "Xin'er, get a chair for Ling'er and let her sit down."

"Okay, Father!" Mo Xin nodded and got a chair for Mo Ling.

Seeing her sit down, Mo Feipeng said to Mo Qingyun and Mo Xiao, "Qingyun, Xiao Xiao, don't be overconfident in the competition for young elites. If you can't win, just admit defeat. This month's competition is just a formality for you."

Hearing this, Mo Qingyun and Mo Xiao smiled bitterly. They did not know what to say.

Of course, the reasons for their smiles were different.

Mo Qingyun smiled because Mo Feipeng had no confidence in him.

Mo Xiao smiled because Mo Feipeng did not know his true strength.

Seeing their smiles, Mo Feipeng said again, "Especially you, Qingyun. I heard that you have a grudge with Mo Hai. They say he has broken through to Sixth Level Body Refinement. If you meet him, just admit defeat and don't fight with him out of anger."

Hearing this, Mo Qingyun's smile deepened. He said gloomily, "Uncle Feipeng, you have no confidence in me at all!"

"Right, Brother Feipeng. The competition hasn't started yet; why are you dampening Qingyun's fighting spirit?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun, Mo Yue Ru glared at Mo Feipeng and said to him, "But what you said is also right. Don't be reckless when fighting; if you meet a Sixth Level Body Refinement cultivator, just admit defeat to avoid getting injured."

"..."

Hearing Mo Yue Ru's words, the four of them raised their eyebrows in exasperation. They were speechless.

Was there any difference between what Mo Yue Ru said and what Mo Feipeng said?

"Uncle Feipeng, why didn't you see Uncle Feilin?"

Mo Qingyun observed the judges' seats and saw that Mo Feilin was not there. He asked Mo Feipeng.

"Old Four said that Qingmu Trading House has some business and he went back to Lianyun City a few days ago." Mo Feipeng chuckled.

Hearing this, Mo Qingyun smiled playfully. He thought to himself, "Uncle Feilin's return to Lianyun City is not just because of Qingmu Trading House."

In Mo Qingyun's view, Uncle Feilin rushed back probably because of Wu Rou.

Of course, he would not say this out loud.

After chatting with Mo Feipeng and the others for a while, it was time to draw lots to decide opponents.

"Now we will start drawing lots to decide the opponents for the competition."

At this moment, an elder from the judges' seats walked out and said solemnly.

Hearing his words, Mo Qingyun and the others went forward one by one to draw lots and match opponents.

"Number One!"

Seeing the number he drew, Mo Qingyun was slightly surprised. He felt unexpected.

He had drawn Number One and would be the first to compete.

Then, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate. He walked towards the Number One competition area.

But what surprised him even more was that his opponent was Mo Hai. Truly, enemies met again!

"Bad luck! Qingyun's opponent is Mo Hai!"

Seeing that Mo Qingyun's opponent was Mo Hai, the expressions of Mo Feipeng and the others changed. They looked worried.

They were most concerned about this scene happening.

In their view, with Mo Hai's current Sixth Level Body Refinement cultivation level, Mo Qingyun could not be his match.

Mo Qingyun and Mo Hai had a grudge. When they fought, Mo Hai would not be gentle with him.

Thinking this, Mo Feipeng looked anxious and shouted at Mo Qingyun, "Qingyun, Mo Hai is now Sixth Level Body Refinement. You can't match him; just admit defeat and don't fight with him."

Hearing this, Mo Hai's expression turned smug. He said coldly to Mo Qingyun, "Qingyun, it seems no one believes you can defeat me."

"No one believing doesn't mean I can't defeat you."

Mo Qingyun replied calmly and looked at Mo Feipeng and the others with a faint smile, indicating that they need not worry.

But when Mo Feipeng and the others saw his expression, their worries deepened even more.

"Qingyun is so stubborn. He didn't listen when I told him not to fight with Mo Hai."

Mo Feipeng looked anxious and worried.

Hearing this, the expressions of Mo Yue Ru and the others became even more concerned.

Compared to them, the surrounding people were curious.

Last month's competition, Mo Hai was beaten by Mo Qingyun like a dead dog with his limbs broken.

Now that a month had passed, Mo Hai's cultivation level improved greatly due to some good fortune. They wondered if he could avenge his defeat this time.

With these thoughts, the surrounding people looked forward to Mo Qingyun and Mo Hai's competition.

In the Number One competition area,

"I really don't know where your confidence comes from."
