With the identity tokens placed, Zhao Qi and the other three elders hurriedly came to Mo Qingyun's side.

They coaxed him into entering the Alchemy Guild headquarters, deeply discussing and guiding Mo Qingyun about拜师 (becoming an apprentice).

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun was somewhat无奈 (helpless). He greeted Mo Feilin and followed the three elders into the Alchemy Guild headquarters.

Mo Qingyun entering the Alchemy Guild headquarters with the three elders was not to become an apprentice.

In his previous life, he was the youngest Dan Zun on the Heavenly Soul Continent; did he need to apprentice under a Third-Rank Alchemist now?

His idea was that, with his current clean slate, if he could捞 (profit) from these three elders' wealth, it would be quite a good thing.

This way, in the coming period of time, his cultivation would definitely see significant improvement.

Chapter 24: The Gifts Received? (Second Update)

After entering the Alchemy Guild headquarters with the three elders, Mo Qingyun found a place to cultivate and rest under the pretense of being too tired from alchemy practice.

Additionally, before entering seclusion, Mo Qingyun informed the three elders to handle those who would come looking for him.

With his experience from his previous life, Mo Qingyun naturally guessed that the various forces in Lianyun City would extend their hands to recruit him or make friendly gestures after learning of his performance today.

The reason Mo Qingyun agreed to come to the Alchemy Guild headquarters was also to avoid those people.

In Mo Qingyun's view, if he were at the Greenwood Trading House, it would be somewhat troublesome to avoid them.

If they became displeased with the Greenwood Trading House because of this, it would not be good for its future development in Lianyun City.

Now that he was at the Alchemy Guild headquarters, there would be no need to worry about this; everything would be covered by the Alchemy Guild headquarters.

When Du Luo and the others heard Mo Qingyun's request, they quickly understood his intentions and nodded in agreement.

"Good disciple, you can rest here peacefully. Your master guarantees that no one will disturb you."

Du Luo and the others patted their chests, assuring Mo Qingyun with confidence.

When agreeing to Mo Qingyun's request, the three elders looked at him with a hint of joy and relief.

Initially, they were worried that Mo Qingyun would become proud after winning first place today.

But seeing his actions now, the elders realized their worries were unnecessary.

After settling matters with the three elders, Mo Qingyun no longer hesitated and entered seclusion directly.

In the Alchemy Guild headquarters, Mo Qingyun's residence.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun sat cross-legged on the ground and took out a green jade bottle from his bosom, pouring out a crimson-colored medicinal pill.

If Guan Chuan were here, he would certainly recognize this as the First-Rank Top-grade medicinal pill, Blood Qi Pill, that Mo Qingyun had refined before.

Originally, these Blood Qi Pills were to be handed over to the Alchemy Guild headquarters.

But because of Du Luo's request, Guan Chuan returned these nine Blood Qi Pills to Mo Qingyun.

Mo Qingyun naturally did not object; he was most in need of cultivation resources now.

With these few Blood Qi Pills, his cultivation could quickly advance by a significant step in the short term.

As soon as he took the Blood Qi Pill into his mouth, Mo Qingyun felt a powerful and pure medicinal power seep into his blood vessels.

Under this medicinal power, Mo Qingyun could clearly feel his flesh and bones gradually strengthening.

After seeing this, Mo Qingyun no longer hesitated and immediately began to refine and absorb it.

Five days passed in the blink of an eye.

After five days of frenzied refinement, all nine Blood Qi Pills Mo Qingyun refined during the assessment were completely absorbed.

After refining these nine pills, Mo Qingyun's gains were considerable; his cultivation directly advanced from the fourth level of Body Refinement to the peak of the fourth level.

Now, he only needed a trigger for his cultivation to break through to the fifth level of Body Refinement.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun did not continue cultivating and waited for the moment when everything would fall into place.

After stopping cultivation, Mo Qingyun walked towards the door with a faint smile. "I've been cultivating for five days straight; Uncle Four must be worried. Let's go back to Greenwood Trading House first."

What Mo Qingyun did not expect was that when he opened the door, he saw familiar faces.

The owners of these faces were naturally Du Luo and the other three elders.

"You..."

Seeing Du Luo and the others guarding outside his room, Mo Qingyun felt a wave of emotion.

"Good disciple, have you finished cultivating?"

Seeing Mo Qingyun come out, Zhao Qi smiled first and then tossed a乾坤袋 (spatial bag) to Mo Qingyun. "Inside are the gifts we collected for you these few days."

"Gifts?"

Hearing Zhao Qi's words, Mo Qingyun was somewhat startled and asked in puzzlement.

Seeing Mo Qingyun's puzzled expression, Zhao Qi and the others grinned slyly and explained. "These few days, many people came to visit you, so we took the opportunity to捞 (profit) a bit for you. Don't worry; after we took their benefits, we beat them up."

"..."

Hearing the three elders' words, Mo Qingyun felt a chill run down his spine and was speechless to the extreme.

At the same time, he felt sorry for those who wanted to befriend him; encountering these three elders was truly their misfortune.

While sighing in his heart, Mo Qingyun opened the spatial bag and was immediately shocked. "This is a hundred-year-old Second-Rank Spirit Herb Snow Orchid Grass, a hundred-year-old Second-Rank Spirit Herb Purple Aster Flower, and a forty-year-old Third-Rank Spirit Herb Fire Lotus Golden Branch..."

Seeing the various spirit herbs in the spatial bag, Mo Qingyun was excited and secretly thought. "These guys are quite generous."

With these spirit herbs, the speed of his cultivation would definitely improve by a notch.

In the short term, he no longer needed to worry about lacking cultivation resources.

Then, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and directly put the spatial bag away.

As for taking these people's benefits without doing them favors, Mo Qingyun did not care about the consequences.

After all, these spirit herbs were not collected by Du Luo and the others; he could pretend to be in the dark later.

"President, two elders, I plan to go back first."

Looking at Du Luo and the others in front of him, Mo Qingyun said calmly.

"Go back?"

Hearing that Mo Qingyun wanted to go back, Du Luo's eyes lit up and he said. "You've been here for a few days; you should go back. Otherwise, your family will worry. But after going back, make sure to tell them about becoming my disciple."

"Pfft, Old Du, do you still have a face? It's clearly me becoming your disciple."

Hearing Du Luo's words, Zhao Qi and the other two did not back down.

Seeing their actions, Mo Qingyun was speechless, not knowing what to say.

Seeing Mo Qingyun's expression, Xu Yu gestured and said. "Good disciple, go back first; you don't need to worry about these matters."

"Alright!"

Mo Qingyun nodded and left the scene, heading towards the exit of the Alchemy Guild headquarters.

He was not worried about Du Luo and the others arguing; their actions were due to their personalities, and they would not hurt each other's feelings.

Moreover, he felt that staying there would only make the scene more chaotic.

After leaving the Alchemy Guild headquarters, Mo Qingyun returned to Greenwood Trading House directly.

However, when he returned to Greenwood Trading House, he was somewhat surprised to see Wu Rou and her sister there.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and greeted Wu Rou. "Aunt Four, you're here too."

"Uh-huh!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun call her Aunt Four, Wu Rou blushed slightly.

"Stinky kid, you finally came back. If you didn't come back soon, I was going to go to the Alchemy Guild headquarters for you."

Seeing Mo Qingyun return, Mo Feilin patted his shoulder and laughed.

It was clear that Mo Feilin felt good today.

"You're boasting. I think you would have been scared stiff before even reaching the Alchemy Guild headquarters."

Hearing Mo Feilin's boast, Wu Rou rolled her eyes and smiled.

"Heh heh!"

Seeing his boast being debunked by Wu Rou, Mo Feilin laughed awkwardly.

Then, Wu Rou chatted with Mo Qingyun and the others for a while. However, Wu Qing was rather quiet.

Perhaps sensing Wu Qing's embarrassment, Wu Rou said to Mo Feilin. "Feilin, we won't disturb you and Qingyun today. My sister and I will go back first; I'll come see you tomorrow."

"Alright!"

Hearing Wu Rou's words, Mo Feilin nodded and hurriedly stood up. "I'll see you out."

After a moment, Mo Qingyun saw the smiling Mo Feilin return and smiled. "Uncle Four, did the Mo family not stop you from being with Aunt Four?"

"The Mo family knows that you won first place in the Alchemy Guild headquarters assessment; they turned a blind eye to your relationship with Wu Rou," Mo Feilin said, glancing at Mo Qingyun with a complex expression. "I think they want to show you goodwill through this; Uncle Four and Wu Rou are benefiting from your reputation."

"Uncle Four, don't say that. What does it matter if we benefit from each other?"

Mo Qingyun waved his hand to interrupt Mo Feilin and continued. "As long as they don't obstruct you and Aunt Four."

Wu family's actions did not surprise Mo Qingyun; unless they were fools, they would not miss the opportunity to befriend him.

Once Wu Rou became his aunt, they would become in-laws; the benefits would be close at hand.

The Wu family had this foresight.

"By the way, what are your plans? Will you stay at the Alchemy Guild headquarters?" Mo Feilin asked seriously, thinking of Du Luo and the others. "Also, those three masters in the Alchemy Guild headquarters value you greatly; who do you plan to become an apprentice under?"

"No, I plan to return to Beimozhen in a few days. As for becoming an apprentice, we'll talk about it next time."

After thinking for a moment, Mo Qingyun slowly said.

"Alright then. I'll return to the tribe in three days; you can come with me," Mo Feilin nodded.

"Alright, then we'll return together in three days."

Mo Qingyun nodded and added,

"Uncle Four, after returning to the tribe, I hope you can keep the matters in Lianyun City confidential; I don't want others to know yet."

"Alright!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, Mo Feilin nodded in agreement.

Chapter 25: Body Refinement Fifth Level (Third Update)

In Mo Qingyun's residence at Greenwood Trading House.

After discussing his return to the tribe with Mo Feilin, Mo Qingyun entered cultivation again.

At this moment, he took out the Third-Rank medicinal pill Solidifying Pill given by Zhao Qi and swallowed it to refine it.

As soon as the Solidifying Pill entered his stomach, Mo Qingyun felt a more refined and abundant medicinal power seep out from the pill, permeating his blood and muscles.

Under the influence of the Solidifying Pill's medicinal power, Mo Qingyun felt warm all over; his blood and muscles seemed to be pulsating.

This feeling made him feel comfortable.

At the same time, he clearly felt his body's strength gradually increasing.

"The Solidifying Pill is quite effective."

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun smiled and immediately began to refine the medicinal power of the Solidifying Pill.

One day later.

Mo Qingyun, who had been in cultivation, opened his eyes with a look of surprise on his face.

"Body Refinement Fifth Level!"

After one day of cultivation, with the help of the Solidifying Pill, his cultivation finally broke through smoothly and he successfully entered Body Refinement Fifth Level.

Although he had reached the fifth level of Body Refinement, Mo Qingyun did not stop but continued cultivating.

Because there was still some medicinal power from the Solidifying Pill remaining in his body, not completely dissipated.

Another day later.

As Mo Qingyun continued to absorb it, the remaining medicinal power from the Solidifying Pill was finally absorbed completely.

After this, Mo Qingyun stopped cultivating and his face showed a look of joy.

Mo Qingyun did not expect that after completely absorbing the Solidifying Pill's medicinal power, his cultivation not only broke through to Body Refinement Fifth Level but also stabilized it and came close to the sixth level.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun was pleasantly surprised.

He felt that if everything went well, his cultivation would enter Body Refinement Sixth Level within ten days.

Apart from the breakthrough in cultivation, after absorbing the Solidifying Pill, the increase in his body's strength also made Mo Qingyun extremely delighted.

"Currently, my body's strength is probably not inferior to that of a Body Refinement Seventh Level person."

Feeling his body's strength, Mo Qingyun looked proud and felt a surge of confidence.

He was confident that even if he faced a Body Refinement Seventh Level person, he could hold his own.

Then, Mo Qingyun practiced the martial techniques "Ninefold Collapse" and "Swift Shadow Steps," familiarizing himself with his current state.

Perhaps due to the breakthrough in cultivation, after practicing for a while, Mo Qingyun found that he had refined "Ninefold Collapse" to the perfection level.

As for "Swift Shadow Steps," although it was still at the True Essence stage, he could now perform it more freely.

After practicing the martial techniques and familiarizing himself with his current strength, Mo Qingyun frowned slightly and thought. "There's still a day before returning to Beimozhen; I can take this time to refine some medicinal pills."

With this thought, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and started refining medicinal pills.

"Now that I have many Second-Rank Spirit Herbs, and with the cauldron Xu Yu gave me, I can start refining some Second-Rank medicinal pills."

Thinking this, Mo Qingyun took out the Crimson Flame Cauldron Xu Yu gave him and then retrieved the herbs and spirit herbs needed for refining.

After everything was prepared, Mo Qingyun began to work.

He planned to refine the Second-Rank medicinal pill Body Refinement Pill, an effect between Blood Qi Pill and Solidifying Pill.

Bang!

Mo Qingyun lightly tapped his right hand, sending a ball of soul fire into the cauldron.

After sending the soul fire into the cauldron, Mo Qingyun lightly tapped his hands like a dragonfly skimming water, orderly placing the herbs and spirit herbs into the cauldron to slowly refine them.

After being placed in the cauldron, the herbs and spirit herbs were gradually melted under the refining of the soul fire, impurities being removed.

After several hours, all impurities from the herbs and spirit herbs in the cauldron were refined away.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun's expression became serious as he began to fuse and condense the herbs and spirit herbs into pills.

Forming a pill was a crucial process in alchemy; even Mo Qingyun did not dare to be careless.

Then, under his control, the herbs and spirit herbs in the cauldron slowly began to fuse together.

About a quarter of an hour later, a rich medicinal aroma spread from the cauldron.

Following this, eleven green pills were condensed in the cauldron.

From their luster, each pill was of high quality. Moreover, from their medicinal power fluctuations, they were definitely not Second-Rank Initial-grade pills.

"Eleven, high-quality Body Refinement Pills; not bad!"

Looking at the medicinal pills in his hand, Mo Qingyun showed a satisfied smile.

Refining eleven high-quality Second-Rank Body Refinement Pills in one batch was the limit for Mo Qingyun's current cultivation level.

Mo Qingyun felt quite satisfied with this.

If Du Luo and the others were here, they would be frightened to death.

Mo Qingyun's true alchemy level was not a First-Rank Top-grade Alchemist but a Second-Rank Top-grade Alchemist.

A sixteen-year-old Second-Rank Top-grade Alchemist would shock many people if mentioned.

"With these eleven Body Refinement Pills, I should be able to cultivate up to the sixth level of Body Refinement."

Carefully putting the eleven Body Refinement Pills into a jade bottle, Mo Qingyun thought to himself.

After storing the Body Refinement Pills, Mo Qingyun prepared to cultivate again. However, at this moment, Mo Feilin knocked on the door looking for him.

Then, from Mo Feilin's mouth, Mo Qingyun learned that the head of Wu family had arrived and wanted to see him.

"Wu Family Head?"

Hearing Mo Feilin's words, Mo Qingyun frowned and showed a playful smile. "It seems that the Wu family can't sit still; it's good to see him, as it will help Uncle Four settle his mind."

After a moment, Mo Qingyun accompanied Mo Feilin to the living room of Greenwood Trading House.

There were three people in the living room, a middle-aged man and two young women.

The two young women were naturally Wu Rou and her sister; the middle-aged man should be Wu Bintian, the head of Wu family.

"Should this be Mo Qingyun young brother? Indeed a fine-looking youth, a hero emerging in his youth!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun arrive, Wu Bintian warmly greeted him with a cheerful smile.

Hearing Wu Bintian call him young brother, Mo Qingyun was speechless and beads of sweat appeared on his forehead.

Young brother?

Wu Bintian should be Mo Feilin's father-in-law; according to the generational order, Wu Bintian should be two generations older than him.

Now, Wu Bintian called him young brother; the generational order seemed a bit mixed up.

"Wu Family Head, please be seated!"

Seeing Wu Bintian's greeting, Mo Qingyun smiled politely and gestured for him to sit.

Seeing Mo Qingyun's calm expression, Wu Bintian was slightly surprised and his gaze towards Mo Qingyun changed.

At this moment, Wu Bintian's evaluation of the young man in front of him increased several notches.

This little fellow seemed more outstanding than he imagined, with maturity and sophistication beyond his years.

If not for Mo Qingyun's slightly youthful face, Wu Bintian would have thought he was facing an old man over a hundred years old.

"Wu Family Head, I heard that Uncle Four needs to prepare ten thousand yuan spirit stones for taking Aunt Four as his wife, is that correct?"

After sitting down, Mo Qingyun directly asked Wu Bintian.

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, not only was Wu Bintian stunned but so were Mo Feilin and the others.

Mo Qingyun was too direct, wasn't he?

Chapter 26: You Refined It?

"Eh!"

Under Mo Qingyun's words, Wu Bintian was momentarily speechless and then said. "Haha, these are just jokes; it was a test for Feilin back then. Ten thousand yuan spirit stones, even the Mo family can't afford that."

Hearing Wu Bintian's words, Mo Feilin and Wu Rou were surprised and their eyes lit up with excitement. They looked at Mo Qingyun with gratitude.

"What does Wu Family Head mean?"

Seeing Wu Bintian's attitude, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and continued to ask.

"Haha, as long as Feilin and Rou Rou are sincere, the betrothal gifts are just a formality. What do you think, Qingyun?"

Wu Bintian chuckled and winked at Mo Qingyun.

Seeing Wu Bintian's expression, Mo Qingyun was speechless and smiled awkwardly. "Haha, of course."

Seeing Mo Qingyun's embarrassed expression, Wu Bintian's lips curled into a faint smile. "He's still just a young lad; it's easy to fool him."

After settling Mo Feilin's matter, Mo Qingyun felt relieved and settled a worry.

Then he talked with Wu Bintian about other matters, such as when he would help the Wu family refine some medicinal pills.

Of course, refining the pills was not now but after he advanced to a Second-Rank Alchemist.

In Wu family's eyes, First-Rank medicinal pills were not very useful; if there was enough money, they could get many channels to obtain First-Rank medicinal pills.

So in their view, it was more suitable for Mo Qingyun to refine the pills after advancing to a Second-Rank Alchemist.

They believed that with Mo Qingyun's talent, it wouldn't take long to advance to a Second-Rank Alchemist.

This time, Wu family could wait.

After about an hour, seeing some matters settled, Wu Bintian smiled contentedly. "Well then, Qingyun, I won't disturb you anymore. Today, I'll take my leave; let's meet again another day."

Hearing Wu Bintian's words, Mo Qingyun felt beads of sweat on his forehead again and sighed inwardly. "It seems the generational order is thoroughly mixed up."

However, Mo Qingyun replied calmly. "Wu Family Head, take your time; I'll see you off."

After seeing Wu Bintian off, Mo Qingyun talked with Mo Feilin and the others for a while before returning to his residence to continue cultivating.

Mo Qingyun knew that now Wu Bintian had tacitly approved Mo Feilin's affection for his daughter, and they probably had much to talk about.

Returning to his residence, Mo Qingyun took out a Body Refinement Pill and began refining it.

As soon as the Body Refinement Pill entered his stomach, it turned into a pure medicinal power and slowly refined Mo Qingyun's body strength.

Under the influence of the Body Refinement Pill, Mo Qingyun felt his body like an iron ingot being hammered and gradually strengthening.

After several hours, when Mo Qingyun refined the third Body Refinement Pill, he heard Mo Feilin's voice outside.

Mo Feilin was notifying him that they would set off to return to the Mo family soon.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun stopped cultivating and tidied up before leaving with Mo Feilin to return to the Mo family.

Half a day later, they returned to the Mo family.

Returning home, Mo Qingyun separated from Mo Feilin and went back to his residence.

After a moment, Mo Qingyun returned to his residence but was surprised to see two graceful figures laughing there.

Seeing these two figures, Mo Qingyun asked in surprise. "Xin Jie, Mo Xiao, what are you doing here?"

"Not welcome?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, the two girls puffed up their chests and said in mock displeasure, giving him a glance.

Seeing the two girls' chests, Mo Qingyun felt embarrassed and smiled awkwardly. "No, not that; just a bit surprised."

"Good for you!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun's answer, the two girls showed satisfaction and exchanged a knowing glance.

Then, Mo Xin smiled mischievously at Mo Qingyun. "Qingyun, I heard you and Uncle Four went to Lianyun City; was it fun? Did you bring us any gifts?"

"Gifts?"

Hearing Mo Xin's words, Mo Qingyun felt a headache and became embarrassed again.

What was he supposed to do? He was a supreme powerhouse in his previous life, the youngest Dan Zun on Heavenly Soul Continent, an old monster who lived for hundreds of years. How could he choose gifts for two girls?

Although he thought this, Mo Qingyun did not dare to say it directly.

After a moment of stammering, he suddenly brightened and said loudly. "Of course I prepared gifts; you didn't say it, so I almost forgot."

Then he took out a jade bottle from his bosom and poured four Body Refinement Pills, giving two to each of the girls.

"Medicinal pills?"

Seeing the green medicinal pills in their hands, both girls were surprised and felt sweet.

Medicinal pills were very rare to them; even First-Rank Low-grade medicinal pills were precious.

This showed that Mo Qingyun was thoughtful.

Beimozhen was not like Lianyun City, where the Alchemy Guild headquarters existed and occasionally sold some medicinal pills.

Most of the medicinal pills in Beimozhen were from Lianyun City, extremely rare and precious.

This was why the two girls showed surprise when they saw Mo Qingyun's medicinal pills.

Seeing their satisfied expressions, Mo Qingyun sighed in relief and smiled. "This time I went to Lianyun City, I bought many herbs and spirit herbs; these four Body Refinement Pills were refined from those materials as gifts for you."

Seeing the panic was over, Mo Qingyun continued to exaggerate. "You refined them?"

Hearing that the medicinal pills were refined by Mo Qingyun himself, both girls were surprised and felt unexpected.

However, if observed carefully, one could see that their surprise was different.

Mo Xiao was surprised at Mo Qingyun's unexpected ability.

While Mo Xin was surprised that Mo Qingyun had come up with something new, from the foundation liquid to medicinal pills.

Although this progress seemed great and the medicinal pills looked good, Mo Xin was hesitant to eat them.

Who knew what materials he used in refining and if there would be side effects?

If something went wrong, it wouldn't be good; could she blame Mo Qingyun for the side effects?

After all, Mo Qingyun's intention was good.

Then Mo Xin quickly thought and said to Mo Xiao. "Xiao Xiao, Qingyun's intentions are good; we should return the medicinal pills to him. After all, these medicinal pills are too precious."

Mo Xin said this because she was worried that Mo Xiao might have some side effects after taking the medicinal pills.

Mo Xiao did not think as much and agreed with Mo Xin. "Xin Jie is right; we should return the medicinal pills to him. Next time, remember to bring us something else as a gift."

Seeing their actions, Mo Qingyun was surprised and somewhat unexpected at the girls' behavior.

But after a moment of surprise, he said to Mo Xiao. "Mo Xiao, Xin Jie's cultivation is already at the tenth level of Body Refinement; the Body Refinement Pills won't have much effect on her. But you are close to breaking through to the fifth level of Body Refinement; if you take one, your cultivation will immediately enter the fifth level."

"Really?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, Mo Xiao's eyes lit up and she asked excitedly.

Seeing Mo Xiao's expression, Mo Xin was anxious but did not dare to stop her.

"Yes," Mo Qingyun nodded.

"Alright, then I'll take one now!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun nod, Mo Xiao took a Body Refinement Pill without hesitation.

Seeing this, Mo Xin showed an exasperated expression and thought. "Xiao Xiao, you're the one who wanted to take it; don't blame me if something goes wrong."

Chapter 27: Breakthrough!

As soon as the Body Refinement Pill entered Mo Xiao's mouth, it turned into a pure medicinal power and seeped into her body to refine her physical strength.

Seeing this, Mo Xiao's face showed a delighted smile and she quickly refined the medicinal power.

As the Body Refinement Pill's medicinal power was slowly refined, Mo Xiao's aura gradually strengthened.

About a quarter of an hour later, Mo Xiao's aura reached its peak.

Body Refinement Fifth Level!

With the help of the Body Refinement Pill, Mo Xiao's cultivation finally broke through to the fifth level.

"Breakthrough!"

Feeling the change in Mo Xiao's aura, Mo Xin widened her eyes and felt incredulous.

After Mo Xiao took the Body Refinement Pill, she had thought of countless possibilities.

But she never imagined that Mo Xiao's cultivation would directly break through after taking the Body Refinement Pill.

"Has he succeeded in refining it again? How is this possible..."

This thought made Mo Xin dizzy and she still felt incredulous.

When did refining medicinal pills become so easy?

Then, Mo Xin widened her eyes and looked at Mo Qingyun as if he were a monster.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun felt uneasy.

When Mo Xin was incredulous, Mo Xiao stopped cultivating and smiled at Mo Qingyun. "Thank you, Qingyun!"

"You're welcome!" Mo Qingyun replied calmly.

But when he saw the fullness of Mo Xiao's chest, he felt embarrassed and thought. "This is my reward for touching your white rabbit during the monthly test."

Of course, he did not dare to say this.

While Mo Qingyun was thinking in his heart, Mo Xiao gratefully handed the remaining Body Refinement Pill to Mo Qingyun. "Qingyun, these Body Refinement Pills are too precious; I've taken one to break through my cultivation. Let me return the remaining one."

Seeing Mo Xiao's actions, Mo Qingyun felt a bit more affection for her and said. "Keep it; I have Body Refinement Pills. Since you've just broken through, taking another one will help stabilize your cultivation."

"Alright!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, Mo Xiao nodded obediently and looked at him with a hint of other colors in her eyes, as if she had made up her mind.

Mo Xiao's expression change did not escape Mo Qingyun, and he replied to her before turning to look at Mo Xin. "Xin Jie, although Body Refinement Pills won't have much effect on your current cultivation, they can refine your physical strength. Take these two Body Refinement Pills."

Seeing the effect of the Body Refinement Pills, Mo Xin no longer doubted their effectiveness and said somewhat embarrassedly. "Heh heh, then I won't be rude."

After putting the Body Refinement Pills away, Mo Xin showed a curious expression and asked Mo Qingyun. "Tell me honestly, are these Body Refinement Pills really refined by you?"

Hearing Mo Xin's question, Mo Qingyun was speechless and replied. "Yes, they are refined by me; is there anything wrong with that?"

Seemingly worried Mo Xin would not believe him, he added. "Also, I'm already a Second-Rank Alchemist now; besides Body Refinement Pills, I can refine many other types of medicinal pills."

"Second-Rank Alchemist?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, both girls were surprised.

"Pfft!"

After a moment of surprise, Mo Xin and Mo Xiao covered their mouths and laughed, clearly doubting Mo Qingyun's words.

"Stinky kid, stop boasting; being a Second-Rank Alchemist is not like reaching the second level of Body Refinement, which anyone can achieve. There are probably no more than five Second-Rank Alchemists in the entire Beimozhen."

Mo Xin rolled her eyes, clearly not believing Mo Qingyun's words.

Hearing Mo Xin's words, Mo Qingyun looked aggrieved and felt a bit depressed.

Seeing his expression, Mo Xin laughed again. "But your lying looks quite convincing."

"I'm really a Second-Rank Alchemist; not only that, I also won first place in the disciple assessment of the Alchemy Guild headquarters in Lianyun City," Mo Qingyun added.

"What is the Alchemy Guild headquarters?"

Mo Xin and Mo Xiao were surprised for a moment, then laughed even more.

"Alright, you don't need to explain anymore. Whether these medicinal pills are refined by you or bought, we appreciate your thoughtfulness," Mo Xin said.

"Alright!"

Mo Xiao nodded. "Qingyun, don't be discouraged; I believe one day you will become a Second-Rank Alchemist. Haha!"
