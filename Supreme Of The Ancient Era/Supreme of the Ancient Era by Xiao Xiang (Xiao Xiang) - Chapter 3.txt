Moments later, the dust settled and Mo Qingyun’s figure emerged.

Mo Qingyun held Mo Lin's fist with one hand, blocking his attack.

He had caught it!

Mo Qingyun actually managed to catch Mo Lin's full-force strike, and so effortlessly.

Seeing this, everyone was momentarily stunned, rubbing their eyes in disbelief.

"How... how is it possible? Mo Qingyun, this good-for-nothing, actually managed to catch Mo Lin's full-force strike."

Mo Hai was shocked at the scene in arena 5, unable to believe his eyes.

Even Mo Hai couldn’t fully withstand Mo Lin's full-force strike.

"That he caught it, this little monkey is truly surprising."

Seeing Mo Qingyun catch the blow, Mo Feilin was pleasantly surprised and stood up involuntarily, exclaiming, "Good lad, I underestimated you. It seems there's a chance for you to enter the top fifteen."

"Back off!"

Amidst everyone’s shock, a low voice came from Mo Qingyun.

Following this, he shook the hand holding Mo Lin's fist slightly. A hidden force surged from his hand into Mo Lin’s fist.

Step, step, step...

Under Mo Qingyun's force, Mo Lin was pushed back continuously, retreating ten steps before stopping.

After coming to a halt, Mo Lin looked at Mo Qingyun in disbelief and exclaimed, "Hidden force? You actually mastered hidden force!"

Chapter 9

"Whoosh!"

As soon as Mo Lin spoke, a wave of shock rippled through the arena.

Hidden force is something only those with Body Refinement Seventh Level can master.

What cultivation level was Mo Qingyun at? Just Body Refinement Fourth Level!

How could someone at Body Refinement Fourth Level master hidden force?

Everyone widened their eyes in disbelief, staring at Mo Qingyun.

This was truly unbelievable, breaking everyone’s perception of reality.

"Hidden force? How is it possible? This good-for-nothing, Mo Qingyun, could master hidden force. It must be a mistake by Mo Lin."

Hearing Mo Lin’s words, Mo Hai was almost driven mad with jealousy, staring at Mo Qingyun enviously.

"This little monkey is truly surprising. Who would have thought he could master hidden force."

Knowing Mo Qingyun had mastered hidden force, Mo Feilin was deeply relieved and his hands were sweating with excitement.

If someone didn’t know, they might think he had mastered hidden force.

"Body Refinement Fourth Level mastering hidden force. Mo Qingyun is truly surprising."

"Not quite, it seems to be a clever use of force rather than true hidden force."

"Is that so? But even if it’s not true hidden force, his ability to master this is still remarkable."

"It seems heaven closed one door for him but opened another, giving him exceptional insight."

...

At this moment, the elders on the judging platform were all surprised and marveling.

In arena 5,

Mo Lin, holding his injured right hand with his left, still looked at Mo Qingyun in shock and asked again, "Did you really master hidden force?"

"No, just a clever use of force."

Mo Qingyun said calmly, not wanting to hide this.

Hidden force is a standard for Body Refinement Seventh Level. Even if he was a Supreme Realm expert reincarnated, he couldn’t master it prematurely.

"A clever use of force?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s answer, Mo Lin’s expression softened a bit. However, even so, there was still admiration and excitement in his gaze.

Though it wasn’t true hidden force, Mo Qingyun’s ability to use force so skillfully was impressive.

If he could master it, his strength would increase significantly.

Mo Qingyun didn’t have a bad impression of Mo Lin. Seeing the excited look on his face, he smiled faintly and said, "If you want to learn it, come find me after the monthly trial. I can teach you."

"Really?" Seeing Mo Qingyun willing to teach him this method of using force, Mo Lin was pleasantly surprised.

Then, without hesitation, he turned to the elders judging and said, "I concede."

Seeing Mo Lin’s concession, one of the elders looked at Mo Qingyun and seemed to want to see through him before saying, "Mo Qingyun wins!"

"Mo Qingyun won? I didn’t hear wrong."

"Mo Lin conceded, I didn’t see wrong."

...

Hearing the result, there was another commotion around.

"Winning! This little monkey is truly surprising."

For Mo Lin’s concession, Mo Feilin was also very surprised.

"Hmph, didn’t expect Mo Lin to concede. This is good, I can settle with you personally." Seeing Mo Lin’s concession, Mo Hai’s expression darkened and he clenched his fists in determination.

At this moment, a young man who looked somewhat like him walked up beside Mo Hai.

Seeing the young man, Mo Hai’s expression changed and he said respectfully, "Big brother, why are you here?"

Big brother!

Hearing Mo Hai’s words, the younger generation around him tensed and looked at him with respect.

This young man was Mo Hai’s big brother, the first among the younger generation of the Mo family, Mo Cang.

"Just came to see."

Mo Cang said indifferently and handed a porcelain bottle to Mo Hai, saying, "Take this. When you need it, take one and it will instantly increase your strength by a thousand catties."

"A thousand catty increase in strength!"

Hearing this, Mo Hai’s expression changed and he exclaimed, "What is this...?"

"Strength Increasing Pill!" Mo Cang said indifferently.

"First-grade high-level medicinal pill." Mo Hai’s pupils constricted and his expression changed in surprise.

Medicinal pills are ranked from one to nine, each grade divided into four levels: initial, middle, high, and perfect.

In the Northern Desert Town, a first-grade high-level medicinal pill was already quite precious.

"Win this monthly trial and I’ll secure your place to train in the Wind Returning Valley for you." Mo Cang looked at the arena and said to Mo Hai.

The Wind Returning Valley was a training ground of the Mo family. Training there would achieve twice the result with half the effort.

Usually, only the younger generation nurtured by the family had the privilege to train there.

"I’ll definitely win first place in this monthly trial." Mo Hai promised nervously, then glared at Mo Qingyun with a sinister look.

Hearing Mo Hai’s promise, Mo Cang nodded approvingly and looked at the arena without speaking.

At this moment, while Mo Cang was talking to Mo Hai, the first round of competition ended and it was time for Mo Hai’s second match.

Not long after, the second round of competition for Mo Hai and his group ended as well.

Then came the competition for the top seven. After a fierce battle, the top seven were decided:

Mo Qingyun, Mo Hai, Mo Xiao, Mo Bing, Mo Hong, Mo Cheng, and Mo Ming.

"Take a one-hour break. Then directly proceed to the top ten ranking match."

One of the elders on the judging platform instructed them after the top seven were decided.

An hour later,

The break was over, and it was time to draw lots for opponents.

Seven people drawing lots meant one would be idle. Mo Qingyun was lucky and drew the idle lot.

Thus, he easily entered the top four.

"Mo Qingyun actually drew the idle lot. His luck is too good."

"But with Mo Qingyun’s strength after defeating Mo Lin, entering the top four was reasonable."

...

Seeing Mo Qingyun draw the idle lot and enter the top four, everyone in the arena was amazed.

"This little monkey actually made it to the top four. Truly surprising."

Seeing Mo Qingyun draw the idle lot and enter the top four, Mo Feilin was also surprised.

Among the other six, Mo Hai drew against Mo Cheng, Mo Xiao against Mo Ming, and Mo Bing against Mo Hong.

Some of the younger generation favored by the elders finally met in this round.

After a fierce competition, Mo Hai, Mo Xiao, and Mo Bing advanced while Mo Cheng, Mo Ming, and Mo Hong were eliminated to compete for the fifth to seventh places.

Thus, the top four spots emerged: Mo Qingyun, Mo Hai, Mo Xiao, and Mo Bing.

"Take a one-hour break before the final match."

Seeing the top four decided, an elder on the judging platform said.

"No need to rest. Let’s go straight into the final match."

At this moment, Mo Hai suddenly said after the elder spoke.

"No need to rest?"

The elder looked surprised and asked the others, "You don’t need to rest either?"

"No need to rest. Let’s start the match."

Seeing this, Mo Xiao and others nodded in agreement.

"Alright, now draw lots for the final match."

Seeing no objections, the elder announced the start of the final round.

Chapter 10

"Mo Xiao!"

Looking at his opponent, Mo Qingyun was slightly surprised.

Mo Xiao was the only girl among the top four. She had a plump figure and an exquisite face, quite beautiful.

"What kind of look is that? Do you look down on women?"

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s odd expression, Mo Xiao frowned and said unhappily.

"No, just a bit surprised."

Seeing Mo Xiao’s fiery personality, he chuckled and said.

Seems this little girl is a spicy one.

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Mo Xiao’s eyes twinkled and she said slyly, "Is that so? Then be gentle with me. I’m a girl."

Seeing Mo Xiao’s playful expression, Mo Qingyun was taken aback. This little girl changes so quickly.

While Mo Qingyun was at a loss, the younger generation around him widened their eyes in envy.

"Didn’t I see it wrong? Mo Xiao is being cute with Mo Qingyun. She looks so charming."

"If Mo Xiao was like this with me, even if she asked me to concede, I would do it."

"You wish. With your Body Refinement Second Level strength, you think Mo Xiao will be cute with you? Dream on."

...

Outside the arena, there was another commotion.

In the arena,

Mo Qingyun sized up Mo Xiao and shook his head, saying, "Concede. I don’t want to fight you."

"Since you don’t want to fight me, then concede. Let me win."

Mo Xiao blinked and said pitifully.

Seeing Mo Xiao’s action, Mo Qingyun was helpless again and shook his head, saying solemnly, "Sorry! I must win first place."

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s words, Mo Xiao’s expression changed and she glared at him, saying, "Hmph, no manners. I’m a girl."

"Since that’s the case, let’s fight."

Following this, Mo Xiao’s expression darkened and she summoned her spirit beast.

Soon after, a white figure appeared above Mo Xiao’s head—a white crane with red feathers on its head.

The Spirit Crane, a seventh-level spirit beast. This was Mo Xiao’s spirit beast.

A seventh-level spirit beast was considered top-tier among the younger generation of the Mo family.

If not for her low cultivation level, she would have been recognized as a key talent of the family.

With Mo Xiao’s seventh-level spirit beast, if everything went well, she had a good chance of breaking through to the True Essence Realm.

"Take this palm!"

With her spirit beast’s assistance, Mo Xiao became much more agile, nearly twice as fast.

In an instant, her palm was near Mo Qingyun’s forehead.

"Fast!"

Seeing this, everyone around widened their eyes in shock.

In that moment, they all thought Mo Qingyun was in trouble.

However, while everyone worried for him, Mo Qingyun dodged her strike at an even faster speed.

Dancing Shadow Steps

With the Dancing Shadow Steps, Mo Qingyun’s speed reached its peak. He was almost a blur.

"So fast! What kind of movement technique is this? I’ve never seen it before."

"Definitely a divine-grade level. Didn’t expect Mo Qingyun to have such a movement technique."

"This little guy is hiding well, having cultivated this movement technique to such an extent. It’s not something achieved overnight."

"If I’m right, Mo Qingyun must have cultivated this movement technique to its essence."

"Cultivated to its essence? How is that possible? It’s not just about cultivation, but also a bit of insight."

...

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s movement technique, the elders on the judging platform were all shocked and couldn’t calm down.

This little monkey has so many secrets, thought the elders collectively.

"What else does this little monkey have hidden?"

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s movement technique, Mo Feilin was also shocked and tightly held his teacup.

"Such a fine movement technique. Didn’t expect such a person to appear in this ordinary monthly trial." Mo Cang’s eyes flickered, and he looked at Mo Qingyun with a hint of greed.

He must get this movement technique. With it, he would surely win the family competition at year-end.

"Impossible! This good-for-nothing Mo Qingyun could master such a fine movement technique?" Mo Hai’s face paled, shocked and incredulous.

In the arena,

"Ah! How could he be so fast? Too fast."

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s figure, Mo Xiao was shocked and said in disbelief.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun raised his right hand and struck at Mo Xiao.

Perhaps because Mo Qingyun’s performance shocked Mo Xiao, she didn’t react to his strike.

Soon after, Mo Xiao was hit squarely by Mo Qingyun’s palm and retreated several steps.

Soft, bouncy, big.

When Mo Qingyun hit Mo Xiao with his palm, he felt a soft and bouncy sensation in his hand.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun realized something was wrong. He saw Mo Xiao glaring at him with a murderous look.

"Bad, hit the wrong spot."

Under Mo Xiao’s gaze, Mo Qingyun felt embarrassed and his face turned red.

He, a Supreme Realm expert, had just groped a little girl.

Although he felt embarrassed, Mo Qingyun couldn’t help but marvel at the sensation. It was really nice.

At the same time, Mo Qingyun’s eyes glanced towards Mo Xiao’s plump figure.

Seeing this, Mo Xiao was furious and glared at him, saying, "Pervert."

Following this, Mo Xiao fled the arena like a ghost.

"What...?"

Seeing this, everyone was stunned and widened their eyes in shock.

What’s going on?

Did Mo Xiao concede?

After a brief moment of surprise, the elder judging said with amusement, "Mo Qingyun wins."

Seeing his expression, Mo Qingyun knew what he meant.

He then gave a wry smile and nodded at him.

As the elder spoke, the arena erupted in noise.

"Mo Qingyun won? How is that possible? Mo Xiao didn’t lose."

"He must have used some sneaky way to win. He looked at Mo Xiao’s sensitive spots with a lecherous gaze."

"Sure, he used an underhanded way to win. He’s a pervert."

"Oh, using his gaze to win without fighting, Mo Qingyun is so cool. I admire you."

"You guys are shameless and perverted. Men aren’t good for anything."

"But, his movement technique was really impressive."

...

For a moment, the ordinary younger generation of Mo family split into two factions and debated.

Hearing everyone’s words, Mo Qingyun felt embarrassed. He was speechless.

These guys are fearless and don’t care about propriety.

Fortunately, they didn’t see him hit Mo Xiao’s chest. Otherwise, it would have been a bigger deal.

Chapter 11

Not long after Mo Qingyun and Mo Xiao’s match ended, Mo Hai and Mo Bing’s match also concluded.

Mo Hai won by a narrow margin. But everyone knew it was because Mo Hai held back.

It was said that Mo Hai had mastered a technique, but he didn’t use it against Mo Bing.

If he had used the technique, the result would have been different.

After these matches ended, it was time for the final match to determine first place.

After a brief rest, Mo Qingyun and Mo Hai entered the arena and faced each other.

"Mo Qingyun, your progress is surprising. But this way, I can settle with you personally."

Mo Hai said coldly and looked at Mo Qingyun.

"Settle with me?"

Mo Qingyun narrowed his eyes and said playfully, "You think too highly of yourself."

"Hmph! Do you think defeating Mo Lin makes you my match? You’re naive."

Mo Hai snorted and said arrogantly, "Since that’s the case, let me show you my true strength."

After his words, Mo Hai’s aura surged.

Body Refinement Fifth Level!

Everyone was surprised to see this. They were shocked.

"Now you must feel desperate. But it’s too late now. I’ll break your limbs and destroy your dantian, making you a complete cripple."

After showing his true strength, Mo Hai looked haughty and said to Mo Qingyun.

But Mo Qingyun just looked indifferent. "Body Refinement Fifth Level, is that strong?"

Hearing this, everyone was stunned and looked at Mo Qingyun in surprise.

Is Body Refinement Fifth Level really strong? Mo Qingyun’s words were right.

But thinking about it, Body Refinement Fifth Level isn’t strong, but Mo Hai’s strength is enough to defeat Mo Qingyun.

"Qingyun, Mo Hai has broken through to Body Refinement Fifth Level and mastered the divine-grade lower-level technique ‘Mountain-Breaking Palm’. You’re not his match. When the match starts, concede to him and get second place. I’m already surprised you made it this far."

Knowing Mo Hai’s cultivation level, Mo Feilin reminded Mo Qingyun worriedly.

"Fourth Uncle, don’t worry. I have my own plan."

Hearing Mo Feilin’s words, Mo Qingyun smiled and said he was fine.

"Hey! Are you really going to fight Mo Hai?"

At this moment, Mo Xiao returned and asked Mo Qingyun.

"Huh!"

Mo Qingyun was surprised to hear her words. "Are you worried about me?"

"Pfft, don’t be self-centered. Who cares about you."

Mo Xiao blushed and glared at Mo Qingyun, "I’m just worried that if you’re crippled by Mo Hai, I won’t be able to take revenge on you."

"Be crippled and can’t take revenge?"

Mo Qingyun said with a smile, "If I’m crippled, won’t it be easier for you to take revenge?"

Mo Xiao felt embarrassed and glared at Mo Qingyun, "You big fool, you’d be better off dead. It would save me the trouble of taking revenge."

Hearing Mo Xiao’s words, Mo Qingyun shivered and said with a smile, "No need to be so harsh. I just touched your..."

"Still talking!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s gaze on her chest again, Mo Xiao glared at him angrily.

Looking at Mo Xiao’s cute angry face, Mo Qingyun smiled inwardly. "Does this little girl like me? Just a touch and she’s so angry."

"Qingyun, are you done talking?"

Seeing Mo Qingyun chatting with Mo Xiao, Mo Hai was jealous and urged him.

Mo Xiao’s cultivation level is low but her talent is top-tier among the younger generation. Many considered her a goddess.

Seeing Mo Xiao flirting with Mo Qingyun, Mo Hai was furious.

Seeing Mo Hai’s impatience, Mo Qingyun shrugged at Mo Xiao and said, "Someone is getting impatient. I’ll deal with him first then chat."

Following this, Mo Qingyun walked back to the arena and faced Mo Hai.

Seeing his figure, Mo Xiao muttered and glared at him, "Spit! Shameless. Who wants to chat with this pervert."

"Let Mo Hai beat you up and turn you into a pig head. Haha!"

Thinking of Mo Qingyun getting beaten by Mo Hai, Mo Xiao giggled.

"Go first."

Mo Qingyun walked to the center of the arena and said casually, "You go first."

At this moment, he seemed to not care about Mo Hai’s strength.

"Mo Qingyun is too arrogant. Does he think his Body Refinement Fourth Level can defeat Mo Hai?"

"He wants to show off in front of Mo Xiao."

"True, better to be beaten up with some face than just get beaten up."

...

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, everyone scoffed.

Seeing Mo Hai go first, he smiled cruelly and said, "Mo Qingyun, I don’t know if you’re ignorant or foolish. You let me go first and I’ll finish you in one move."

Mountain-Breaking Palm

Mo Hai roared, his steps swift as he charged at Mo Qingyun and struck with a palm.

Boom...

Mo Hai’s strike carried a rumbling sound, like falling rocks.

This was the small success stage of Mountain-Breaking Palm. A single strike could split stones and clouds, opening mountains.

"Strong! Mo Hai’s palm is so strong that even a Body Refinement Fifth Level person wouldn’t dare to block it."

"Mo Qingyun is done for. After this strike, he’ll be crippled."

...

Seeing Mo Hai’s powerful attack, everyone looked at Mo Qingyun sympathetically.

Boom!

Amidst their concern, a dull sound came from the arena. A violent force spread out.

Following this, they saw cracks like spider webs on the ground in the arena. This was from Mo Qingyun and Mo Hai’s clash.

Ninefold Collapse

As everyone marveled at the sound of their clash, they saw Mo Qingyun strike back.

Bang!

They saw Mo Hai fly backward and land heavily on the ground, leaving a mark.

Everyone was stunned. This scene seemed surreal.

Mo Hai lost!

A Body Refinement Fifth Level person with a technique, and he was defeated in one move.

"Qingyun, you beat Mo Hai with just one move?" Mo Feilin was stunned and couldn’t believe his eyes.

"Mo Hai lost! This pervert beat Mo Hai!"

Mo Xiao widened her eyes and covered her mouth, looking at Mo Qingyun in the arena with a heart pounding.

Chapter 12

Silence...

In this moment, the arena was silent. One could hear everyone’s breathing.

"Mo Hai lost and even used a technique, this is truly unbelievable."

"Mo Qingyun seemed to use another technique. He’s hiding so well, mastering two techniques."

"Truly surprising! Mo Qingyun mastered another technique to the small success stage."

"We underestimated this little guy. Though his spirit beast isn’t strong, his insight is remarkable."

...

After a moment, everyone sighed in amazement.

As Mo Hai stood up with a fierce look at Mo Qingyun, he said, "Mo Qingyun, you forced me. Get ready to die."

Speaking, Mo Hai took a jade bottle and swallowed a pill before charging at Mo Qingyun.

"That’s... Strength Increasing Pill!"

Seeing the pill, Mo Feilin’s expression changed and he shouted angrily at Mo Hai, "Bold Mo Hai! Pills are forbidden in the monthly trial. Stop!"

But Mo Hai ignored him and charged at Mo Qingyun.

Seeing this, Mo Feilin was worried and urged Mo Qingyun, "Qingyun, back off. With the Strength Increasing Pill, Mo Hai’s strength is like Body Refinement Seventh Level."

"Mo Hai took the Strength Increasing Pill!"

Hearing this, Mo Xiao was shocked and shouted at Mo Qingyun, "Stupid, dodge! You want to die?"

"Strength Increasing Pill? Mo Hai took it. So shameless, cheating."

"Mo Qingyun is done for. With the Strength Increasing Pill, Mo Hai’s strength rivals Body Refinement Seventh Level."

"Ah! I can’t watch. Mo Qingyun is done for."

...

Hearing Mo Feilin’s words, everyone was shocked and worried about Mo Qingyun.

At this moment, an elder beside the arena rushed in to stop Mo Hai but was a step late.

When he reached the center, Mo Qingyun had already raised his hand to meet Mo Hai’s strike.

Ninefold Collapse

Mo Qingyun roared and struck, a force spreading in the air.

Bang bang bang...

Three dull sounds echoed as the force surged to its peak and struck Mo Hai.

Boom!

Following this, someone flew out of the arena. It was Mo Hai.

Even with the Strength Increasing Pill, Mo Hai was struck and flew out by Mo Qingyun.

Everyone was stunned. Their minds couldn’t process this scene.

"Struck back?"

Seeing Mo Hai struck again, Mo Feilin was stunned and couldn’t believe his eyes.

This scene was the opposite of what he imagined.

"Good, good, good. Not bad for a descendant of my brother."

Seeing Mo Qingyun catch and strike back Mo Hai, Mo Xiao widened her eyes in shock. "He actually caught and struck back Mo Hai with the Strength Increasing Pill. How is this possible..."

"Mo... Mo Qingyun, so strong! Even with the Strength Increasing Pill, Mo Hai isn’t his match."

"Is this guy really that good-for-nothing? When did he become so strong?"

...

Everyone looked at Mo Qingyun with awe.

"Enduring humiliation, biding his time. Bearing the name of a good-for-nothing, was this for today’s moment?"

"He succeeded. From now on, Mo Qingyun will no longer be called a good-for-nothing."

"Seeing his performance today, I’m looking forward to his future growth."

...

The elders on the judging platform couldn’t help but marvel at Mo Qingyun’s performance.

As everyone marveled, Mo Qingyun slowly approached Mo Hai with a cold expression.

Only he knew that if not for his Supreme Realm reincarnation and rich combat experience, as well as mastering Ninefold Collapse to the small success stage, he would have been injured by Mo Hai’s strike.

Then the result would be clear. He would be seriously injured and crippled, becoming a true good-for-nothing.

Thinking this, Mo Qingyun felt a surge of killing intent.

Since Mo Hai disregarded the rules and wanted to cripple him, he had no more reservations.

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s cold expression approaching, Mo Hai was scared and said nervously, "What... what are you going to do?"

"What am I going to do?"

Mo Qingyun narrowed his eyes and said coldly, "What am I going to do? Of course, cripple you."

Snap!

He then kicked Mo Hai’s leg, breaking it instantly.

"Ah!"

The pain made Mo Hai scream and sweat pour down his forehead as he convulsed.

"Stop!"
