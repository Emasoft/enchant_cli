Ling Luo, you have always focused on cultivating speed but neglected your soul's advantage. In the future, strengthen your use of martial spirit and delve deeper into sword manipulation techniques.

Ruo Shui, although your attacks are fierce, your martial spirit is primarily illusory. In the future, diversify your attacks; a mix of real and illusory strikes will greatly enhance your power.

...

Listening to Mo Qingyun's explanation, Lu Fangliang and the others' eyes lit up as they immediately gained insight.

At the same time, their admiration for Mo Qingyun reached its peak.

In just a few days of interaction, Mo Qingyun could pinpoint their weaknesses and offer them the most reasonable advice. This was truly remarkable.

After Mo Qingyun finished speaking, Ling Luo's face showed excitement and he couldn't help but praise: "Boss, you're amazing. After your guidance, I feel enlightened."

"Indeed, Mo Brother's advice is more profound than that of the elders in my clan. It simplifies complex concepts and every word carries deep wisdom."

Following Ling Luo's words, Long Yutian couldn't help but exclaim.

As for Lu Fangliang and Ruo Shui, although they didn't speak, their expressions revealed that they thought the same as Long Yutian.

"Haha, it's good if it helps you!"

Regarding his companions' surprise, Mo Qingyun didn't explain much but smiled faintly.

Did he need to tell them that his profound insights were due to being a reborn supreme realm powerhouse?

Thus, under Mo Qingyun's guidance, the strength of Long Yutian and his companions improved significantly. Their mastery over the Four Symbols Formation also became more proficient, enhancing its power.

Upon this discovery, Mo Qingyun no longer hesitated and said to everyone: "Since you have mastered the Four Symbols Formation, let's proceed deeper into the cave."

"Alright!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun speak, Long Yutian and his companions nodded in agreement, following him into the cave.

...

With previous experience, Mo Qingyun and his companions entered the cave with ease.

Puff puff puff...

As they delved deeper, a fluttering sound soon emerged from within the cave. These were Blood Pattern Soul-Devouring Bats.

Upon this discovery, Mo Qingyun's face changed and he reminded Ling Luo and the others: "Form the Four Symbols Formation!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's reminder, Ling Luo and his companions didn't hesitate and summoned their martial spirits to form the Four Symbols Formation.

Once formed, it displayed a formidable aura, like four ancient beasts guarding all directions.

Boom!

As Ling Luo and his companions formed the Four Symbols Formation, Mo Qingyun took out the silver drum and struck it, producing a thunderous sound.

The drum's sound dispersed the Blood Pattern Soul-Devouring Bats' sonic waves, preventing them from affecting Ling Luo and his companions.

After dispelling the sonic attack, Mo Qingyun's face darkened as he said to Ling Luo and his companions: "Charge forward!"

Following this, Mo Qingyun led the way, charging ahead.

Gravity Suppression!

With each step, Mo Qingyun released the essence of earth to suppress the Blood Pattern Soul-Devouring Bats, affecting their mobility.

Furnace Sun Mountain-Splitting Blade!

After suppressing the Blood Pattern Soul-Devouring Bats, Mo Qingyun didn't hesitate and took out his Fire Silk Blade to slash at the Blood Pattern Soul-Devouring Bats.

As the blade fell, a fiery dragon-like aura erupted from it, roaring towards the Blood Pattern Soul-Devouring Bats.

Wherever the blade's aura passed, it incinerated large numbers of Blood Pattern Soul-Devouring Bats, dropping them to the ground with a thud.

As Mo Qingyun attacked, Lu Fangliang and his companions joined in, sweeping through the Blood Pattern Soul-Devouring Bats.

Under the Four Symbols Formation, their combat power reached its peak. The Blood Pattern Soul-Devouring Bats were swiftly dispatched, even faster than Mo Qingyun.

At this moment, Lu Fangliang and his companions were like death reapers, wherever they went, the Blood Pattern Soul-Devouring Bats fell.

Whizz!

However, as Mo Qingyun and his companions were in the heat of battle, a beam of light suddenly shot towards them.

Crack!

Under this ray, Long Yutian's bone armor shattered.

Pfft!

Simultaneously, Long Yutian spat out blood and his complexion turned pale, his consciousness becoming hazy.

Seeing this, everyone's expressions changed as they looked towards the source of the light beam.

Upon inspection, they discovered a Blood Pattern Soul-Devouring Bat with four pairs of wings and two large eyes in the middle. This was an Eye Demon possessing a Blood Pattern Soul-Devouring Bat's body.

"This... this is an Eye Demon, possessing a Blood Pattern Soul-Devouring Bat's body!"

"Four pairs of wings, this is an Eye Demon comparable to the Fourth Level True Essence Realm. Mo Brother, we should retreat."

"How did this thing get here? This is troublesome; Eye Demons are the most difficult to deal with."

...

Upon seeing the Eye Demon among the Blood Pattern Soul-Devouring Bats, Long Yutian and his companions' expressions changed, their faces becoming solemn.

Only Ling Luo remained calm: "Don't worry; with Boss here, he'll handle the Eye Demon."

Long Yutian and his companions glared at Ling Luo, thinking he was blindly trusting Mo Qingyun.

"Eye Demon!"

Seeing the Eye Demon among the Blood Pattern Soul-Devouring Bats, Mo Qingyun's eyes lit up with joy.

Whizz!

As everyone discovered the Eye Demon, a beam of light shot from its eyes towards Long Yutian and his companions.

Soul Heaven Seal

Dragon Fire Seal

Seeing the Eye Demon's attack, Mo Qingyun didn't hesitate and countered it.

With previous experience, he handled the Eye Demon with ease, his movements fluid and proficient.

Boom!

The beam of light struck the Soul Heaven Seal and Dragon Fire Seal, producing a muffled sound before being deflected.

Mo Qingyun had blocked the Eye Demon's attack?

Seeing this, Long Yutian and his companions were shocked, their eyes wide with disbelief.

Could the Eye Demon's attack be blocked?

As Long Yutian and his companions were in shock, Mo Qingyun said excitedly: "Brother Lu, cover me while I deal with the Eye Demon."

Fierce Bird Break

With his words, Mo Qingyun moved towards the Eye Demon.

"Mo Brother, don't..."

Seeing Mo Qingyun's actions, Long Yutian and his companions tried to stop him.

But before they could speak, Mo Qingyun had already reached the Eye Demon and attacked it.

Seeing this, Long Yutian and his companions no longer spoke but said: "Let's go over there."

Following this, Long Yutian and his companions moved to Mo Qingyun's side, covering him while dealing with the Blood Pattern Soul-Devouring Bats.

Whizz!

As Long Yutian and his companions arrived, the Eye Demon shot another beam of light towards Mo Qingyun.

Seeing the Eye Demon's attack again, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and said: "One trick to rule them all; this won't work on me."

Soul Heaven Seal

Dragon Fire Seal

As he spoke, Mo Qingyun summoned the Soul Heaven Seal and Dragon Fire Seal to counter the Eye Demon's beam of light.

Azure Flame Heavenly Dragon, manifest!

Blood Energy Rampage!

After blocking the Eye Demon's attack again, Mo Qingyun didn't hesitate and summoned his martial spirit to unleash its abilities.

Immediately, a huge crimson shadow appeared above him, enhancing his aura with soul energy.

Under this enhancement, Mo Qingyun's power surged to the Fourth Level True Essence Realm in an instant.

Furnace Sun Mountain-Splitting Blade!

With the soul energy enhancement, Mo Qingyun raised his hand and slashed at the Eye Demon.

As he did so, a powerful fiery dragon aura erupted from his blade, striking the Eye Demon with force.

Chirp!

Seeing the fiery dragon aura approaching, the Eye Demon cried out in fear and fled into the cave.

"Want to escape? No way!"

Seeing the Eye Demon flee, Mo Qingyun's face darkened and he pursued it swiftly.

Fierce Bird Break

With the essence of wind enhancing his speed, Mo Qingyun moved like a blur.

Soon, he caught up with the Eye Demon and slashed at it again.

Pfft!

With one slash, he severed all four pairs of wings from the Eye Demon. It then fell to the ground.

Chirp!

Seizing the moment, Mo Qingyun slashed again, cutting the Eye Demon in half.

The Eye Demon fell to the ground and twitched before lying still. It was killed by Mo Qingyun!

Gulp!

Seeing this, Long Yutian and his companions swallowed hard, looking at Mo Qingyun in shock.

He had killed the Eye Demon!

"Mo... Brother Mo, you're so fierce; even an Eye Demon was killed by you."

"I wonder what else he can do?"

"Is this guy even human? He killed an Eye Demon alone."

"Not surprised, Boss killed an Eye Demon in his first battle."

"What? He killed an Eye Demon in his first battle, can he get any more impressive?"

...

Long Yutian and his companions' faces twitched as they looked at Mo Qingyun like he was a monster.

They were shocked that the Eye Demon, which they feared so much, had been killed by Mo Qingyun.

This was a huge shock for them.

Puff puff puff...

Perhaps because the leader had been killed, the remaining Blood Pattern Soul-Devouring Bats fled.

Soon, all of them were gone.

Seeing this, Long Yutian and his companions relaxed, smiling with relief.

After the Blood Pattern Soul-Devouring Bats retreated, Mo Qingyun said to Lu Fangliang and the others: "Brother Lu, now that the Blood Pattern Soul-Devouring Bats have retreated, quickly collect the battlefield essence crystals. I need to refine this Eye Demon."

Refine an Eye Demon?

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, Long Yutian and his companions were stunned.

Could he be any more crazy?

He killed the Eye Demon, now he wants to refine it; how beastly!

At this moment, Long Yutian and his companions thought the same.

"Not surprised, Boss has refined Eye Demons before."

Seeing their expressions, Ling Luo smiled indifferently and said: "With your current temperaments, you need to learn more from me if you want to follow Boss."

Ling Luo said this without considering that the first time he saw Mo Qingyun refine an Eye Demon, he almost went mad.

"Tsk! Shameless."

Hearing Ling Luo's words, Ruo Shui rolled her eyes and said: "The first time you saw Qingyun refine an Eye Demon, maybe you were even worse."

"Right!"

Hearing this, Long Yutian nodded in agreement and said: "I bet you were scared to death."

"Pfft, not me. I'm not that timid."

Ling Luo said with a guilty expression and then looked at Ruo Shui, asking: "Ruo Shui, what did you call Boss just now?"

Hearing Ling Luo's question, Ruo Shui looked puzzled and asked: "I called him Qingyun. What's wrong with that?"

"Qingyun! Oh..."

Hearing Ruo Shui, Ling Luo and his companions' expressions changed, their eyes becoming somewhat ambiguous.

Seeing this, Ruo Shui blushed and said angrily: "Shameless! I'll go collect the battlefield essence crystals."

Seeing Ruo Shui's flushed face, Long Yutian and his companions didn't tease her further but followed to collect the battlefield essence crystals.

Meanwhile, Mo Qingyun began refining the Eye Demon, gradually enhancing his eyes with its bloodline.

...

As he continued to refine the Eye Demon's bloodline, Mo Qingyun's eyes emitted a more powerful and fierce aura.

If observed closely, one could see flashes of purple light in his tightly closed eyes. These purple lights were like lightning in the clouds, giving a mesmerizing feeling.

Several hours later, Mo Qingyun finally refined the Eye Demon's bloodline, further enhancing his eyes and increasing their power.

What truly surprised him was that he now mastered the Eye Demon's ability, the beam of light. This outcome exceeded his expectations.

Additionally, Mo Qingyun discovered that the suppression on his Dantian had lessened. Now he could utilize more powerful Dantian energy, reaching the True Essence Realm level.

Mo Qingyun believed that with continued refinement of Eye Demons, he would soon be able to utilize the power of a Nascent Soul Realm Dantian.

"It seems we need to accelerate our Eye Demon hunting."

In Mo Qingyun's heart, his eagerness to hunt Eye Demons grew stronger.

With that thought, he opened his eyes with a pleased expression. As he did so, a powerful purple light flashed in his eyes.

Seeing this, Long Yutian and his companions were shocked.

"Devil's Eyes! These are the Eye Demon's eyes!"

"Why did Mo Brother's eyes turn into Devil's Eyes? Did he get possessed by an Eye Demon?"

"Boss's Devil's Eyes seem even more terrifying now."

...

Long Yutian and his companions were shocked, exclaiming in amazement.

"Sorry for keeping you waiting!"

Seeing Ling Luo and his companions, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and greeted them.

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, Long Yutian and his companions' expressions softened but still showed concern.

"Mo... Brother Mo, are you alright?"

"I'm fine," Mo Qingyun replied with a faint smile.

"But your eyes?"

Hearing this, Lu Fangliang asked worriedly.

"Haha, don't worry. The change in my eyes is just from mastering a new technique."

Seeing their concern, Mo Qingyun explained simply.

Mastered a new technique?

Hearing this, Long Yutian and his companions were surprised, showing curiosity.

However, seeing Mo Qingyun didn't want to elaborate further, they stopped asking.

"Let's continue deeper."

Mo Qingyun glanced at them and said as he walked into the cave.

Seeing Mo Qingyun move forward, Long Yutian and his companions followed without hesitation.

Soon, they passed through the cave and entered the Nine Palaces Secret Treasure. It was a place like an earthly paradise.

Birds singing, flowers blooming, pavilions and terraces, artificial mountains and green trees, bridges over flowing streams. The scenery was breathtaking.

"How beautiful!"

Seeing this, Ruo Shui's face lit up with joy. She ran towards the flowers and danced gracefully.

Seeing Ruo Shui dancing among the flowers, Mo Qingyun and his companions were momentarily stunned. She looked like a butterfly in a flower garden or a fairy in a painting, exquisitely beautiful.

"How beautiful!"

They all couldn't help but admire her.

"Let's go take a look."

After a brief moment, Mo Qingyun smiled and walked towards a cave.

Entering the cave, they saw several stone rooms. Most were empty.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun and his companions continued deeper into the cave.

Soon, they arrived at a room resembling a study filled with scrolls. Mo Qingyun took one scroll and opened it.

Upon reading, he discovered the scrolls contained various arrays and insights from the Nine Palaces Elder on arrays.

It seemed these scrolls were the Nine Palaces Elder's life work.

Ling Luo and his companions glanced at the scrolls but lost interest, putting them back in their original places.

"Who knew after all this effort, we'd only find these scrolls," Ling Luo said with disappointment.

Hearing him, Ruo Shui and the others showed similar expressions. Clearly, they had no interest in arrays.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun looked puzzled and asked: "Didn't you come to the Nine Palaces Secret Treasure for the Nine Palaces Elder's array insights and the Nine Palaces Array Disk?"

"I admit, I'm lazy. I don't have the patience to study arrays," Long Yutian said with a sheepish smile.

"Arrays are too mentally taxing. I came here just to find some cultivation materials," he added.

Find cultivation materials?

Hearing this, Mo Qingyun smiled wryly. Coming to an array master's cave for cultivation materials? Could there be a more unlikely reason?

Then, he looked at Lu Fangliang and Ruo Shui. "Are you the same?"

Hearing him, they showed indifferent expressions.

Next, he looked at Ling Luo. Seeing Mo Qingyun's gaze, Ling Luo waved his hand and said: "Boss, don't look at me. If I had time, I'd be flirting with girls instead of looking at these boring scrolls."

Seeing their reactions, Mo Qingyun was speechless. The Nine Palaces Elder's life work, a vast treasure, lay before them, and they showed no interest.

If the Nine Palaces Elder knew his life work was being ignored, he might crawl out of the ground.

Since Ling Luo and his companions didn't want them, Mo Qingyun collected all the array scrolls. He was interested in arrays and wanted to study them.

"Mo Brother, you're interested in arrays?" Long Yutian asked curiously.

"It's a good way to pass the time," Mo Qingyun chuckled.

Hearing this, they showed skeptical expressions.

Seeing Mo Qingyun collect all the scrolls, Ling Luo said: "Boss, there's nothing else here. Let's leave."

"Hmm! There's a fluctuation in soul energy!"

As Ling Luo spoke, he frowned and looked at the bookshelf.

Mo Qingyun walked closer to the bookshelf and moved it aside. Behind it, a simple invisibility array appeared.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and said: "There's an invisibility array here. The Nine Palaces Elder's treasures should be behind it."

Then, he began breaking the array.

Seeing this, Ling Luo and his companions were surprised by Mo Qingyun's actions. Was he breaking the array?

"Break it for me!"

After a moment, Mo Qingyun formed a hand seal and struck the invisibility array.

As his hand seal entered the array, it dispersed, revealing a stone door. Mo Qingyun pushed it open to reveal a room filled with items.

Seeing the items, Ling Luo and his companions were shocked.

"This is a mid-grade treasure, Soul Devouring Blade, Ten Extremes Sword, Crystal Shield of Thousand Pounds, Butterfly Dress..."

"Also Ice Fire Xuanliu, White Feather Fiery Phoenix, Red Dragon's Heart, Flying Snake's Heart..."

"Look, there's the Nine Palaces Array Disk!"

...

Seeing these treasures, Ling Luo and his companions were ecstatic.

"Boss, can I have this Ten Extremes Sword?"

Looking at the mid-grade treasure, Ling Luo's eyes sparkled with anticipation.

Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and said: "Take whatever you like, no need to ask me."

Hearing this, Long Yutian and his companions hesitated briefly before picking their items. Each took one item.

Lu Fangliang chose the Soul Devouring Blade, Long Yutian picked the Crystal Shield of Thousand Pounds, and Ruo Shui selected the Butterfly Dress.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun didn't say much. He collected the remaining items and took out some medicinal pills to give Long Yutian and his companions.

"Mo Brother, what are you doing?"

Seeing Mo Qingyun's actions, Long Yutian asked curiously.

"These pills will speed up your cultivation," Mo Qingyun said seriously as Long Yutian tried to refuse.

"Good!"

Hearing this, they accepted the pills. They remembered Mo Qingyun's kindness deeply.

...

Outside the Nine Palaces Secret Treasure, many forces had arrived. Leading them were Lei Hao and Ying Xing.

"Indeed, there's a secret treasure!"

Seeing the Nine Palaces Secret Treasure, Lei Hao said coldly: "Let them enjoy it for a while. When they come out, I'll give them an unexpected surprise."

"Lord Lei Hao, when those youngsters come out, their expressions will be priceless," a young man beside him said with a cold smile.

"Ma Hua, you did well this time," Lei Hao said with a smug laugh. "Once we get the Nine Palaces Secret Treasure and ancient treasures, you'll have your rewards."

"Thank you, Lord Lei Hao!"

Hearing this, Ma Hua and his companion smiled.

Ma Jue said coldly: "Youngster, without that Red Flame by your side, with so many against you, I'll make sure you die a miserable death."

Around them, several people smiled coldly: "Mo Qingyun, without that Red Flame by your side, with so many against you, how will you survive?"
