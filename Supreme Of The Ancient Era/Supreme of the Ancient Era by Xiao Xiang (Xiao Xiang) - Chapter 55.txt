Upon hearing Zuo Mu's words, Zuo Lin and the others showed a look of unwillingness as they supported Ma Jue and Ma Hua back into the house.

Seeing Zuo Mu suddenly compromise, Mo Qingyun frowned slightly and pondered silently in his heart.

He thought that Zuo Mu's current behavior was too unusual, but he did not pay much attention to it. In front of him, Zuo Mu and the others could not play any tricks.

"Brother Dragon, please arrange accommodations for Brother Mo and Brother Ling."

Seeing Zuo Mu's four leave, Lu Fangliang instructed Long Yutian and then returned to his own room alone.

Seeing Lu Fangliang leave, Ruoshui glanced at Mo Qingyun and followed him out without speaking.

"Brother Mo, Brother Ling, Lu Brother and Miss Ruoshui are both cold on the outside but warm at heart. You need not worry, you will get used to it over time."

Long Yutian chuckled and gestured them with a hand, saying, "Come, I will take you to your accommodations."

"Alright!"

Upon hearing this, Mo Qingyun nodded and followed Long Yutian to their accommodations.

In Zuo Mu's room,

"Brothers Ma Jue and Ma Hua, I am truly sorry for the trouble you have had to endure this time."

Returning to his room, Zuo Mu showed an apologetic expression and apologized to Ma Jue and Ma Hua. He then took out a乾坤 bag (Qian Kun Bag) and said, "There are ten thousand yuan spirit stones inside as compensation for you two. I hope you will accept them."

"Brother Zuo Mu, you are being too polite," Ma Jue said politely and then took the乾坤 bag (Qian Kun Bag) from Zuo Mu.

Seeing Ma Jue take the乾坤 bag (Qian Kun Bag), Zuo Mu smiled faintly and said, "Since you two are injured, it would be best if you return to rest."

"Alright then,"

Hearing Zuo Mu's words, Ma Jue and Ma Hua nodded successively and left the room.

Seeing them leave, Zuo Lin and the others showed displeased expressions with cold gazes following their backs.

"Big Brother, these two fellows did not put in any effort and received ten thousand yuan spirit stones. Isn't that too generous?"

"From my perspective, we could take advantage of their current injuries and eliminate them to gain some benefits."

"Big Brother, why did you agree to let those two youngsters join us?"

"They are clearly on the same side as Long Yutian, having them in will make our future actions more troublesome."

...

After Ma Jue and Ma Hua left the room, Zuo Lin and others expressed their dissatisfaction.

Hearing everyone's thoughts, Zuo Mu smiled faintly and waved his hands to示意 (indicate) Zuo Lin and the others to stop.

Seeing that Zuo Lin and the others stopped talking, Zuo Mu said, "Do not mind Ma Jue and Ma Hua. They are just minor characters; we cannot let them ruin our big plans."

Hearing Zuo Mu's words, Zuo Lin and the others nodded successively.

At this moment, Zuo Mu revealed a mysterious smile and looked at Zuo Lin with a question, "Brother Two, do you find Mo Qingyun familiar?"

"Familiar?"

Hearing Zuo Mu's words, Zuo Lin pondered and recalled Mo Qingyun's appearance.

Not long after, Zuo Lin's eyes lit up in surprise and exclaimed, "Big Brother, do you mean that Mo Qingyun is the person on the notice in Jiufang City?"

"Exactly!"

Seeing Zuo Lin recall, a cold smile appeared at the corner of Zuo Mu's mouth as he said, "If my guess is correct, this young man should be the one."

"What are you two talking about? We can't understand a word," Zuo Sen and the others beside them asked with puzzled expressions.

Hearing Zuo Sen's question, Zuo Lin sneered and said excitedly, "Old Three, Old Four, not long ago when Big Brother and I went to Jiufang City for help from Ma Jue brothers, we saw a notice in the city saying that someone had obtained an ancient treasure. This person is Mo Qingyun."

"What? It's this young man!"

Hearing Zuo Lin's words, Zuo Sen and the others were startled.

Following this, they showed ecstatic expressions and said excitedly, "Could it be that Big Brother intends to use these two young men as bait and capture them all, obtaining both the Jiugong Secret Treasure and the ancient treasure?"

"Exactly!"

Seeing Zuo Sen and others understand his plan, Zuo Mu sneered triumphantly and said solemnly, "Once we obtain the Jiugong Secret Treasure and Mo Qingyun's ancient treasure, our four brothers will focus on cultivation. When we emerge from seclusion, it will be the time for us to dominate the Great Yan Dynasty."

"Big Brother is wise!"

Hearing Zuo Mu's words, Zuo Lin and the others were excited with憧憬 (yearning) expressions.

Looking at them now, it seemed as if they had already obtained the Jiugong Secret Treasure and ancient treasure.

In a small room,

"Previously, Lei Hong's silver drum is quite good. It can be refined for future use."

Mo Qingyun sat cross-legged, took out Lei Hong's乾坤 bag (Qian Kun Bag), and prepared to take out the silver drum.

Thump thump thump...

After Mo Qingyun took out and opened Lei Hong's乾坤 bag (Qian Kun Bag), he suddenly sensed his eyes twitching rapidly.

Inside the乾坤 bag (Qian Kun Bag), there seemed to be something that had a slight connection with his eyes.

"What's going on?"

Feeling the twitching of his eyes, Mo Qingyun changed expressions and was shocked.

Then he sensed Lei Hong's乾坤 bag (Qian Kun Bag) to find the object that caused his eyes to twitch.

After a moment, a black thing resembling a whip caught his attention.

"Is this the object that has a connection with my eyes?"

Taking out the whip-like thing, Mo Qingyun frowned and examined it closely.

"This... seems to be an eyelash!"

After a thorough examination, Mo Qingyun recognized the origin of this thing and was shocked, exclaiming, "I have assimilated the bloodline of Eye Demon, causing my eyes to change. This thing can cause a reaction in my eyes; could it be related to the Eye Demon?"

Discovering this, Mo Qingyun examined the black eyelash again, trying to find some secrets.

"There seems to be a very powerful force within this black eyelash."

After sensing it with his soul power, Mo Qingyun was shocked again.

Boom!

At this moment, a terrifying soul force surged into his mind as Mo Qingyun was shocked.

Soul Heaven Seal

Discovering this, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and immediately summoned twenty-seven Soul Battle Seals to form a soul wall, resisting the invading soul force.

Boom boom boom...

As soon as the soul wall formed, that terrifying external soul force fiercely collided with it.

It felt like waves crashing against the shore.

Seal Door, Seal!

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and immediately used his martial soul technique to seal the invading soul force.

Under the sealing of Seal Door, the external soul force finally calmed down and was no longer chaotic.

"Phew!"

Seeing the invading soul force sealed, Mo Qingyun exhaled deeply and felt relieved, thinking to himself, "What a close call! Such terrifying soul impact. The soul force contained in just one eyelash is so powerful, what kind of existence is this person? Could he be a Sovereign?"

At this moment, Mo Qingyun was filled with doubts. He believed that even at his peak, he could not achieve this level.

Therefore, only a more powerful existence like a Sovereign could reach such a degree.

After the brief shock, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and began to refine the soul force that had invaded his mind.

In the following time, Mo Qingyun spent it refining the soul.

Several hours later, Mo Qingyun slowly opened his eyes with a look of joy on his face.

"Early Spirit Origin Realm!"

After refining the external soul force, Mo Qingyun's soul cultivation had made such great progress.

Discovering this, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and began to refine the black eyelash.

As he refined the black eyelash, Mo Qingyun sensed a powerful force entering his body.

With this powerful force entering his body, he immediately felt the power of his eyes rapidly increasing.

"This black eyelash is indeed related to Eye Demon!"

Discovering this, Mo Qingyun was moved and found answers to his previous guesses.

Then he refined the black eyelash even more vigorously.

After a while, Mo Qingyun successfully refined the black eyelash and strengthened his eye power.

At this moment, when Mo Qingyun opened his eyes, a purple light flashed in his pupils and his gaze became more piercing.

Moreover, after refining the black eyelash,

Mo Qingyun clearly sensed that the suppression of his Dan Palace by the battlefield force had significantly weakened.

"The battlefield force's suppression on my Dan Palace has weakened."

Discovering this, Mo Qingyun changed expressions and tried to mobilize the power of his Dan Palace.

After a few attempts, Mo Qingyun was slightly disappointed and said, "Although I can mobilize some of it, it's only at the True Qi Realm level. It seems that I need to accelerate the hunt for Eye Demons and refine their bloodline."

"However, relying on my own strength to find Eye Demons for hunting might be inefficient."

Thinking about searching for Eye Demons in the vast battlefield of a hundred countries, Mo Qingyun felt somewhat unrealistic.

Then he began to ponder strategies.

After a while, Mo Qingyun's eyes lit up and thought, "Perhaps I can establish a force to help me find the traces of Eye Demons."

This idea rooted in his mind, he felt it was a feasible solution.

Then Mo Qingyun continued to examine Lei Hong's乾坤 bag (Qian Kun Bag), looking for valuable items.

"This is... Battlefield Essence Crystals!"

After examining, some purple-black crystals in the乾坤 bag (Qian Kun Bag) caught his attention.

Battlefield Essence Crystals, formed by the condensation of battlefield essence force in a hundred countries' battlefield, can be absorbed by martial artists to enhance their battlefield cultivation.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and immediately began refining the Battlefield Essence Crystals.

Then, one by one, Mo Qingyun extracted the battlefield essence force from the Battlefield Essence Crystals and refined it to enhance his own battlefield cultivation.

In the following time, Mo Qingyun spent refining.

After a while, Mo Qingyun's aura suddenly surged and reached the second level of True Essence Realm.

"My battlefield cultivation has broken through to the second level of True Qi Realm."

Discovering this, Mo Qingyun showed a look of joy and continued to cultivate to stabilize his cultivation.

"Boss, Brother Long asked me to find you. He said there are matters to discuss."

After Mo Qingyun cultivated for a while, Ling Luo's voice came from outside the room.

"Alright!"

Hearing Ling Luo's words, Mo Qingyun stopped cultivating and got up to go outside.

After a moment, Mo Qingyun came before Lu Fangliang and the others and found a place to sit.

Seeing Mo Qingyun arrive, Lu Fangliang began to narrate.

Hearing Lu Fangliang's narration, Mo Qingyun finally understood the reason why Long Yutian wanted to find them.

It turned out that Lu Fangliang and the others had discovered a secret treasure, but this treasure was special and required nine people to open it.

Therefore, Long Yutian and the others wanted to find two more people to make up nine.

After an hour, after discussing some precautions for the next steps, everyone set off towards the Jiugong Secret Treasure.

After Mo Qingyun and the others left, Ma Jue and Ma Hua saw their injuries almost healed and returned to Jiufang City.

"Big Brother, are we just going to let it be like this?"

On the way back to Jiufang City, Ma Hua showed a look of dissatisfaction and asked Ma Jue.

"Of course not,"

Hearing Ma Hua's words, Ma Jue showed a grim expression and said, "They want to leave us two brothers behind? No way. I will spread the news about this Jiugong Secret Treasure and make them suffer."

"But we don't know where the Jiugong Secret Treasure is," Ma Hua said with some difficulty, "Moreover, we received ten thousand yuan spirit stones from that Zuo Mu. Isn't it a bit unfair to do this?"

"What's the matter with not knowing?"

Ma Jue shrugged and said, "There is no wall without cracks. As long as we spread the news, someone will find the location of this Jiugong Secret Treasure through subtle clues. Then under everyone's watchful eyes, they will all die."

Hearing Ma Jue's words, Ma Hua showed a sneer and expressed admiration.

In Jiufang City,

"Lei Hong and the others were killed?"

In the city lord's mansion, a young man wearing a golden crown heard the report and his expression darkened. He gritted his teeth and said, "Find out immediately who dared to kill my people from the Lei Kingdom. I will make them pay a heavy price."

"Brother Leihao, don't be angry,"

Seeing the young man in a blue robe beside him show an expression of anger, he smiled faintly and said, "Later, I will have the Eagle Kingdom's people help you find this murderer. But for now, the most important thing is to find that person who obtained the ancient treasure."

"Haha, Brother Eaglexing has a point,"

Hearing the young man in blue's words, Leihao's expression improved and he smiled faintly at Eaglexing, "With Brother Eaglexing and the Eagle Kingdom's help, this murderer won't escape."

"City Lord, two people came to report that they know the secret of a treasure and want to present it to you."

At this moment, as Leihao and Eaglexing were talking, a guard walked up to report.

"Oh!"

Hearing the guard's words, Leihao was surprised and said excitedly, "Quickly bring them up."

Soon, the two people were brought in.

If Mo Qingyun and the others were here, they would recognize them. They were precisely Ma Jue and his brother.

After arriving, Ma Jue and his brother began to narrate about the Jiugong Secret Treasure to Leihao.

On their way to the Jiugong Secret Treasure, in a demon beast carriage,

"Brother Fangliang, what treasures are there in the Jiugong Secret Treasure?"

Ling Luo asked curiously.

"The Jiugong Secret Treasure is the cultivation cave of the Jiugong Elder. It contains his lifetime collection and his famous array treasure, the Jiugong Array Disk..."

Lu Fangliang's expression was cold as he slowly introduced it to Ling Luo.

"Jiugong Array Disk!"

Hearing Lu Fangliang's words, Ling Luo and Mo Qingyun changed expressions slightly and guessed that the Jiugong Elder should be a master of array formations.

The collection of an array formation master would definitely be astonishing.

Then Ling Luo continued to ask about some details regarding the Jiugong Secret Treasure.

As Ling Luo and Mo Qingyun were talking, a pungent fragrance suddenly entered Mo Qingyun's nose.

"Hmm?"

Smelling this fragrance, Mo Qingyun frowned and thought to himself, "This fragrance... it's the Shadow Poison Fragrance, a bane for Super Martial Soul cultivators. How could someone carry it and release its fragrance on purpose?"

Discovering this, Mo Qingyun immediately felt his Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul becoming drowsy as if it was about to fall asleep.

At this moment, when the Shadow Poison Fragrance approached Mo Qingyun's Light Gate martial soul, it released a surge of soul force.

Under this soul force, the Shadow Poison Fragrance near the Light Gate martial soul dissipated without a trace.

Moreover, under this soul force's effect, even the Shadow Poison Fragrance that was eroding the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul was dispersed.

Then, the Light Gate martial soul released another surge of soul force to resist the Shadow Poison Fragrance's erosion on Mo Qingyun.

"Ah! The Light Gate martial soul can resist the poison of Shadow Poison Fragrance!"

Discovering this, Mo Qingyun was slightly surprised and felt a sense of joy.

Seeing the Light Gate martial soul dispel the Shadow Poison Fragrance, Mo Qingyun turned to look at Lu Fangliang and the others.

Looking over, Mo Qingyun found that Ruoshui, Lu Fangliang, Long Yutian, and Ling Luo all had frowns on their faces, looking somewhat uncomfortable.

It seemed that their martial souls were affected by the Shadow Poison Fragrance's erosion.

On the contrary, Zuo Mu and his brothers looked calm, seemingly unaffected at all.

Moreover, if observed carefully, one could see a sly smile on the corners of Zuo Mu and his brothers' mouths.

After taking in everyone's expressions, Mo Qingyun quickly understood and thought to himself, "It must be these four who played a trick. I didn't expect them to bring out the Shadow Poison Fragrance, so they must have been plotting for a long time."

Although he knew Zuo Family's four had ulterior motives, Mo Qingyun did not immediately expose them.

He thought that they would still need Zuo Mu and his brothers to enter the Jiugong Secret Treasure, so it was not yet time to deal with them.

But Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and immediately took out the Crimson Flame Cauldron to refine medicinal pills for Ling Luo and others to detoxify.

Seeing Mo Qingyun take out the Crimson Flame Cauldron, Long Yutian showed a curious expression and asked, "Brother Mo, what are you doing?"

Hearing Long Yutian's question, Mo Qingyun chuckled and replied, "I am idly refining some medicinal pills to pass the time."

"Who knew Brother Mo had such a hobby!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's answer, Long Yutian smiled faintly and replied.

But from his expression, it was clear that he did not think Mo Qingyun's alchemy skills were very high.

Not only Long Yutian, but Ling Luo and the others beside him also had similar expressions.

Ignoring everyone's reactions, Mo Qingyun took out various medicinal herbs and began refining them.

As Mo Qingyun started refining the medicinal pills, a faint fragrance of medicine spread from the cauldron.

Smelling this fragrance, Ling Luo and the others' expressions changed slightly, their spirits refreshed a bit.

Seeing Lu Fangliang's group's reactions, Zuo Mu and his brothers' expressions changed slightly, their faces showing some displeasure.

Then, Zousen showed a dissatisfied expression and said, "Boy, what kind of medicinal pills are you refining? The smell is so unpleasant. Are you trying to熏死大家 (fumigate everyone)?"

Hearing Zousen's words, Ling Luo immediately felt displeased and replied, "Pfft! My boss's medicinal pills may smell bad, but they are still better than your stinky sachets. A bunch of men carrying sachets, so feminine."

"Alright, stop arguing,"

Seeing Ling Luo and Zousen quarrel, Lu Fangliang's expression was cold as he stopped them and said, "Prepare yourselves. We are about to reach the Jiugong Secret Treasure."

Hearing Lu Fangliang's words, Ling Luo and Zousen stopped arguing.

"Done!"

At this moment, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly as he opened the cauldron and took out five green medicinal pills, putting them into a jade bottle. He smiled faintly and said, "The timing is just right."

Then Mo Qingyun put the Crimson Flame Cauldron back into his乾坤 bag (Qian Kun Bag).

At this moment, the demon beast carriage arrived at a mountain range. This was the location of the Jiugong Secret Treasure.

Seeing their destination, Lu Fangliang got off the carriage first and led the way.

Following Lu Fangliang's actions, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate to follow closely behind.

Soon, Mo Qingyun and the others arrived outside a cave.

Outside the cave were nine stone pillars. Each pillar had strange runes carved on it, with a recess in the middle that seemed to be for keys.

"Brother Mo, Ling Luo, this is the key to the secret treasure."

As Mo Qingyun examined the stone pillars, Lu Fangliang took out a star-shaped key and handed it to him. "Insert the key into the recess, then infuse it with essence force, and you can open the Jiugong Secret Treasure."

After hearing Lu Fangliang's explanation, everyone stood in their positions and began to open the Jiugong Secret Treasure.

Boom thump...

As Mo Qingyun and others inserted the key into the recess and infused it with essence force, the cave's stone door slowly opened.

"Let's go in!"

Seeing this, Lu Fangliang said calmly and walked into the cave.

Then Mo Qingyun and others followed closely behind, entering the cave one after another.

Boom!

After Mo Qingyun and others entered the cave, the stone door automatically closed again.

At the same time, Mo Qingyun felt a flash before his eyes and entered a black bamboo forest.

Swoosh swoosh...

As soon as they arrived in the black bamboo forest, Mo Qingyun found that the surrounding black bamboos moved rapidly, leaving trails of afterimages.

As these bamboos moved, they wildly swung their branches and struck Mo Qingyun.

What shocked Lu Fangliang and the others was that each strike from these branches was comparable to a full-power attack by a True Essence Realm middle-stage martial artist.

Seeing this, everyone's expressions changed and became serious.

"Be careful, these bamboos are very strong. Let's charge through!"

Seeing this, Lu Fangliang said seriously and reminded everyone.

Then he took out a crescent blade and slashed at the approaching bamboo branches.

Clang!

To Lu Fangliang's surprise, his blade did not damage the bamboo branches at all; no marks appeared.

"How is this possible!"

Seeing this result, Lu Fangliang and the others were shocked.

The hardness of these bamboos far exceeded their expectations.

Pfft!

At this moment, Ling Luo was struck by a bamboo branch and received a狰狞的伤口 (horrible wound), blood flowing.

Seeing Ling Luo injured, Mo Qingyun frowned and examined the black bamboos.

"These are Mystic Golden Demon Bamboos, no wonder they are so tough."

After examining them, Mo Qingyun recognized their origin and showed a look of joy.

Mystic Golden Demon Bamboos, although troublesome, are extremely rare materials for array formation.

At the same time, Mo Qingyun knew how to deal with these bamboos.

Although Mystic Golden Demon Bamboos are extremely hard, their souls are very fragile. As long as you defeat their souls, you can kill them.

Soul Heaven Seal

Then Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and raised his hand to summon a Soul Battle Seal, striking the Mystic Golden Demon Bamboo's root.

Squeak!

Struck by Mo Qingyun's Soul Battle Seal, the bamboo immediately let out a cry and fell to the ground, no longer moving.

"Brother Mo, you..."

Seeing this scene, everyone's expressions changed and were shocked by Mo Qingyun's actions.

The black bamboos that they feared could be easily killed with one strike from Mo Qingyun.

"Follow me, I will lead you out of the bamboo forest!"

Mo Qingyun said solemnly and raised his hand to summon a Soul Battle Seal, striking the approaching Mystic Golden Demon Bamboos.

Under Mo Qingyun's continuous attacks, many Mystic Golden Demon Bamboos were killed. Later on, these bamboos even retreated and dared not approach.

Swoosh swoosh...

Soon, the surrounding Mystic Golden Demon Bamboos all disappeared without a trace.

"What a close call. Thanks to Brother Mo, we would have been in trouble otherwise,"

Seeing the Mystic Golden Demon Bamboos rapidly retreat, Long Yutian's expression relaxed and he smiled brightly, expressing gratitude to Mo Qingyun.

As Long Yutian expressed his thanks, Lu Fangliang and the others beside him did so as well, casting grateful glances at Mo Qingyun.

Of course, Zuo Family's four brothers were not in this group. At this moment, their expressions flickered as if they were pondering something.

Regarding Zuo Family's four brothers' behavior, Mo Qingyun took it all in but did not say much. He said to everyone, "Let's continue deeper."

After Mo Qingyun spoke, he walked forward and put the Mystic Golden Demon Bamboos into his乾坤 bag (Qian Kun Bag).

Seeing Mo Qingyun walk forward, everyone did not hesitate and followed closely behind.

Soon, they passed through the bamboo forest and arrived in a dark cave.

As they delved deeper into the cave, they found purple-black crystals on the walls.

These were all Battlefield Essence Crystals.

"Battlefield Essence Crystals!"

Seeing thousands of Battlefield Essence Crystals, everyone's expressions changed and showed looks of joy.

With these Battlefield Essence Crystals, their cultivation would definitely increase significantly if they refined them all.

Then Zouchai showed a greedy expression and walked forward excitedly, putting the Battlefield Essence Crystals into his乾坤 bag (Qian Kun Bag).

As Zouchai collected the Battlefield Essence Crystals, Zuo Mu and his brothers hurriedly walked forward to collect them as well.

"Let's do it too!"

Seeing Zuo Family's four brothers' actions, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and said to Ling Luo and the others before walking forward.

Puff puff puff...

At this moment, as Mo Qingyun collected the Battlefield Essence Crystals, a series of wing flapping sounds came from inside the cave.

Soon, huge bats with blood-red eyes and black bodies rushed towards them.

Buzz...

As the bats approached, a dizzying sound wave surged into everyone's minds.

"These are Blood Pattern Soul Capturing Bats!"

Seeing these bats appear, Mo Qingyun's expression changed and said to everyone, "Be careful of the Blood Pattern Soul Capturing Bats. Don't let them get close to you!"

As Mo Qingyun reminded everyone, he took out Lei Hong's silver drum without hesitation and struck it.

Dong dong...

The sound of the silver drum immediately dispersed the Blood Pattern Soul Capturing Bats' sound waves.

Without the influence of the sound waves, Lu Fangliang and others became clear-minded again.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun moved his body and rushed in front of Lu Fangliang and the others, saying, "Don't confront these Blood Pattern Soul Capturing Bats head-on. Retreat to the outside of the cave."

Fire Dragon Seal

After reminding everyone, Mo Qingyun immediately summoned forty-nine Fire Dragon Battle Seals.

With the increase in his cultivation, the power of the Fire Dragon Battle Seals increased significantly.

As soon as the Fire Dragon Battle Seals appeared, they formed a huge flame shield to resist the frenzied attacks of the Blood Pattern Soul Capturing Bats.

At this moment, under the resistance of the flame shield, the attacks of the Blood Pattern Soul Capturing Bats weakened again, giving Mo Qingyun and others an opportunity to retreat.

"Quickly exit the cave!"

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun immediately reminded everyone and led them to quickly retreat from the cave.

Squeak squeak...

Seeing Mo Qingyun and others retreating, the Blood Pattern Soul Capturing Bats fiercely pursued them, wildly colliding with the flame shield as if trying to tear it apart.

Heavy Pressure Suppression!

Golden Jade True Body

Seeing the Blood Pattern Soul Capturing Bats rapidly approaching, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and released his Artistic Power and used the martial technique Golden Jade True Body.

Under the heavy pressure suppression, the speed of the Blood Pattern Soul Capturing Bats immediately slowed down. Mo Qingyun and others took this opportunity to quickly retreat from the cave.

Soon, Mo Qingyun and others safely retreated outside the cave.

"Phew! What a close call!"
