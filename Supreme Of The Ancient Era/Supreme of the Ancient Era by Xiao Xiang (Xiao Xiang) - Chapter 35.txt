When Wan Yuexuan said this, Mo Qingyun and the others nodded in understanding.

However, at that moment, when everyone was silent, Chilan suddenly spoke up: “Young Master Wan, I am a good candidate to recommend you.”

Hearing Chilan’s words, Wan Yuexuan smiled and said eagerly: “Please enlighten me, Senior!”

“I believe that our young master is the most suitable candidate!” Chilan said as he looked at Mo Qingyun.

“Mo Young Master?”

Hearing Chilan’s recommendation, Wan Yuexuan and Wan Lianyun were both surprised.

After a brief moment of surprise, Wan Yuexuan said: “Mo Young Master, although he has an unparalleled talent for alchemy, the competition in the Heavenly Realm is about combat strength. Such a contest… Mo Young Master seems unsuitable, doesn’t he?”

“Yuexuan is right. This kind of contest indeed isn’t suitable for Mo Young Master to participate in.”

Wan Lianyun nodded in agreement with Wan Yuexuan’s viewpoint and added: “Moreover, Mo Young Master is currently only at the Eighth Level of True Qi Realm. He will be at a disadvantage in battle, and during the contest, if Mo Young Master gets injured, we will feel guilty.”

Mo Qingyun is not good at fighting?

Hearing Wan Lianyun and Wan Yuexuan’s words, Du Luo and the others’ expressions immediately became strange.

This Mo Qingyun has comprehended two principles, his combat strength is astonishing; how can he not be good at fighting?

Furthermore, during the battle with Xue Family’s elders, Mo Qingyun even crippled a True Qi Realm powerhouse.

How can he not be good at fighting?

Stop joking!

Now, Wan Lianyun and Wan Yuexuan think that Mo Qingyun is not good at fighting; they are wrong.

“Haha, City Lord Wan and Young Master Wan, you have made a mistake this time.”

After a brief moment of surprise, Du Luo chuckled and said: “You underestimate Qingyun. To put it bluntly, even if your cultivation reaches True Essence Realm, you still can’t be his match.”

“How is that possible? With my True Essence Realm cultivation, how could I not be Mo Young Master’s match?”

Hearing Du Luo’s words, Wan Yuexuan was surprised and couldn’t believe what he heard.

Zhao Qi also smiled slyly at Wan Yuexuan and said: “Haha, if we talk about cultivation, you are higher. But when it comes to realm comprehension, Qingyun is far superior.”

“Huh?”

Seeing Du Luo and Zhao Qi both say this, Wan Lianyun looked curious and asked: “Does Mo Young Master have some unknown trump cards or methods?”

“Haha, if I say that Qingyun has comprehended the Wind and Earth principles, would you believe it, City Lord Wan?” Du Luo looked at Wan Lianyun and his son with a sly smile.

“What?”

“Mo Young Master… he comprehended the Wind and Earth principles?”

“This… how is that possible? How can one comprehend the principle at True Qi Realm?”

…

For a moment, Wan Lianyun and his son were shocked, unable to believe it.

“Good disciple, show them your Wind and Earth principles,” seeing Wan Lianyun’s disbelief, Zhao Qi smiled at Mo Qingyun.

“Alright!”

Seeing Zhao Qi speak up, Mo Qingyun nodded and successively displayed the Wind and Earth principles.

As Mo Qingyun displayed the two principles, Wan Lianyun and his son were stunned on the spot.

“Sss!”

Then, both of them sucked in a breath and looked at Mo Qingyun with eyes full of awe.

Too terrifying!

At True Qi Realm, he comprehended two principles; is this even human?

“You are too intimidating, Mo Young Master.”

Wan Yuexuan immediately looked depressed and said with a smile: “You have such an extraordinary alchemy talent, now you also have such an extraordinary cultivation talent. How can we live with this?”

“Uh!”

Seeing Wan Yuexuan’s expression, Mo Qingyun was taken aback and speechless.

“Haha…”

Seeing Wan Yuexuan’s expression, everyone burst into laughter.

Wan Lianyun patted Wan Yuexuan on the head and laughed: “Brat, now you know what it means to have people outside your realm. From now on, you will train diligently.”

Hearing Wan Lianyun’s words, Wan Yuexuan became even more depressed.

“Since that is the case, for the Cloud Sea Heavenly Realm competition, we will rely on Mo Young Master.”

After learning that Mo Qingyun comprehended two principles, Wan Lianyun no longer doubted.

He was very clear about the power of principle comprehension. With two principles, Mo Qingyun could deal with opponents at the same realm as easily as eating and drinking.

At this moment, to increase Wan Lianyun’s confidence, Xu Yu said: “City Lord Wan, with Qingyun participating, you can rest assured. The Heavenly Realm competition will definitely belong to the City Lord’s Mansion.”

Zhao Qi added: “City Lord Wan, you may not know that before coming to the Xue Family, Qingyun crippled Xue Zhuang, one of the elders in the Xue Family.”

“Mo… Mo Young Master crippled Xue Zhuang?”

Hearing Zhao Qi’s words, Wan Lianyun was stunned and almost couldn’t believe his ears.

Xue Zhuang from the Xue Family, he had some impression of him; a True Qi Realm First Level powerhouse.

A True Qi Realm First Level powerhouse was crippled by Mo Qingyun.

“This…”

At this moment, Wan Lianyun didn’t know what to say anymore.

Then, hearing Zhao Qi’s words, Wan Yuexuan couldn’t hold it in any longer and pointed at Mo Qingyun excitedly: “You… you are a freak!”

When he said this, Wan Yuexuan was almost crazy. Why is the difference so great between them?

Seeing Wan Yuexuan’s depressed expression, Wan Lianyun and the others laughed again and looked at him with sympathy.

Chapter 129: Revenge (Second Update)

About half an hour later, Mo Qingyun and Chilan returned to the Jade Mansion.

“Qingyun is back!”

Seeing Mo Qingyun return, everyone in the Mo Family relaxed. After hearing Du Luo’s words earlier, they were all on edge.

Now that Mo Qingyun returned safely, they could finally relax.

“Mm!”

Mo Qingyun nodded and then said to Mo Hongtian: “Grandfather, I have something for you.”

Mo Qingyun finished speaking and took out several books on alchemy, handing them to Mo Hongtian.

Alchemy入门, Alchemy大全, Alchemy真解, Alchemy心得…

Seeing the books in his hands, Mo Hongtian and the others were stunned with joy.

Alchemy is a skill that only some ancient families or sects can learn.

At this moment, before Mo Hongtian and the others could recover from their shock, Mo Qingyun handed them a乾坤袋.

Taking the乾坤bag from Mo Qingyun’s hand, Mo Hongtian asked curiously: “What is inside?”

“Some元stones!” Mo Qingyun smiled faintly.

“元stones!”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Mo Hongtian and the others were shocked.

Opening the乾坤bag to check, Mo Hongtian was stunned; he almost couldn’t believe his eyes.

A pile of white stones, at least hundreds of thousands.

Hundreds of thousands of元stones; how many gold coins would that be? At this moment, Mo Hongtian felt his head spinning.

He could say without exaggeration that he had been the head of Mo Family for many years and had never seen so much money.

Mo Hongtian was excited and asked Mo Qingyun: “There are at least hundreds of thousands of元stones in there, right?”

Mo Qingyun nodded.

“Mm, there are thirty thousand元stones.”

Thirty thousand元stones!

After getting the exact number from Mo Qingyun, Mo Hongtian and the others were shocked; their hearts raced.

However, before Mo Hongtian and the others could recover from their shock, Mo Qingyun took out some red crystals.

Principle Crystals!

The red crystals Mo Qingyun took out were Fire Principle Crystals.

Seeing the Principle Crystals, Mo Hongtian and others with high-level True Essence Realm cultivation were extremely excited.

With these Principle Crystals, their chances of breaking through to the元丹Realm would increase many times over.

After handing some Principle Crystals to Mo Hongtian, Mo Qingyun then handed him some medicinal pills and weapons.

After taking these items from Mo Qingyun, Mo Hongtian’s old face was filled with excitement and he sighed: “I suddenly feel that the decades I spent as head of Mo Family were in vain.”

“If those Mo Kuide and others hadn’t died, they would have been frightened by these things.”

Mo Kuixin also sighed.

“Thinking about it now, Mo Kuide and others were shortsighted; they thought Qingyun couldn’t match Mo Cang.”

At this moment, some second-generation members of the Mo Family looked down on the deceased Mo Kuide and others.

Seeing everyone’s reaction, Mo Qingyun didn’t say much; he said to Mo Hongtian: “Grandfather, I have some matters to attend to and may leave the Jade Mansion for a few days.”

“To leave the Jade Mansion for a few days?”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Mo Hongtian immediately showed concern and asked: “Is it far? Is it dangerous?”

For Mo Hongtian’s worry, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and said to them: “Grandfather, don’t worry. This time I’m going out to collect some debts.”

“To collect debts?”

Mo Hongtian and the others looked puzzled.

Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened, and he said coldly: “The debts that the Song Family and He Family owe us Mo Family should be settled.”

Hearing this, Mo Hongtian and the others’ expressions darkened; they said in unison: “That’s right, we should settle the debts with Song Family and He Family. We will go with you.”

“Yes! We’ll accompany you!”

Others responded in agreement.

Seeing everyone’s reaction, Mo Qingyun waved his hand and said: “Now that Mount Tai Sect, Heavenly Dragon Gang, and Xue Family are extremely resentful towards us Mo Family, if we all go together, I’m worried they will ambush us on the way. It’s better for you to stay in Jade Mansion.”

Mo Qingyun said solemnly: “As for collecting debts from Song Family and He Family, Chilan and I will go. Recently, if you have nothing to do, it’s best not to leave Jade Mansion. With the guards sent by City Lord Wan guarding Jade Mansion, it will be safer here.”

“Alright, you should also be careful on the way to North Desert Town.”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, everyone in the Mo Family no longer insisted; they knew that following him would only add trouble.

Then, Mo Qingyun talked with everyone for a while and left the Jade Mansion with Chilan to head towards North Desert Town.

This time, after leaving Lianyun City, Mo Qingyun was somewhat surprised that Mount Tai Sect, Heavenly Dragon Gang, and Xue Family didn’t follow him.

However, Mo Qingyun didn’t pay much attention to it; this way they would be more relaxed on the journey.

About several hours later, Mo Qingyun and Chilan arrived at North Desert Town.

After arriving in North Desert Town, Mo Qingyun didn’t immediately go to the Song and He families; instead, he entered a hotel with Chilan for some rest.

In Mo Qingyun’s view, the Song and He families were always there; they wouldn’t run away in a short time. Going later wouldn’t matter.

After entering the hotel, Mo Qingyun and Chilan went straight to the second floor of the hotel and sat in an inconspicuous spot.

“Have you heard? Song Wenyun from the Song Family was taken as a disciple by an元丹Realm powerhouse in Lianyun City’s Xue Family.”

“I heard it early. I also heard that He Shengchao from the He Family was taken as a disciple by an元丹Realm powerhouse in Xue Family.”

“Wow, they are so lucky to be favored by an元丹Realm powerhouse and taken as disciples.”

“Then, they will soar high in the future; their prospects are limitless.”

“That’s natural. Being taken as a disciple by an元丹Realm powerhouse is like winning the lottery for eight lifetimes.”

“In my opinion, even if Mo Qingyun returns now, he can’t be a match for Song Wenyun and He Shengchao.”

“Now, both Song Wenyun and He Shengchao are at the Seventh Level of True Qi Realm. I think they can kill Mo Qingyun with a finger.”

“Moreover, does Mo Qingyun dare to return? Now several元丹Realm powerhouses in Xue Family are waiting for him; he will go with no return.”

…

For a moment, various conversations reached Mo Qingyun’s ears.

“Song Wenyun and He Shengchao were taken as disciples by an元丹Realm powerhouse in Xue Family?”

Hearing the conversation below, Mo Qingyun’s lips curled up with a playful smile.

“Move aside, don’t block the way!”

At this moment, as everyone was talking, a harsh voice came from outside the hotel.

Then, Mo Qingyun saw two arrogant young men enter the hotel with a group of lackeys.

Seeing these two arrive, everyone immediately showed respectful expressions and moved aside voluntarily.

“Look, that’s Song Wenyun and He Shengchao!”

“So impressive! Being taken as a disciple by an元丹Realm powerhouse is really different.”

…

Seeing Song Wenyun and He Shengchao surrounded by lackeys, everyone looked envious.

Seeing the respectful and admiring looks from others, Song Wenyun and He Shengchao raised their heads arrogantly with a proud expression as they walked towards the second floor of the hotel.

After reaching the second floor, Song Wenyun raised his head arrogantly and pointed at everyone on the second floor of the hotel, saying: “In ten breaths, make them leave. If they don’t leave, break their legs and throw them down.”

Soon, everyone on the second floor of the hotel was frightened away by these lackeys.

In no time, apart from Song Wenyun and his group, only Chilan and Mo Qingyun were left on the second floor of the hotel.

Chapter 130: Third Level True Qi Realm?

Seeing everyone on the second floor of the hotel being driven away by Song Wenyun and his group, the hotel owner immediately panicked.

“Master Wenyun, Master Shengchao, how can you do this? How can I run my business?”

Soon, the hotel owner came with a bitter expression and said to Song Wenyun and He Shengchao: “This is my small business; I can’t afford your折腾. Please spare me.”

“Shut up! Do you believe that if you talk more, we will tear down your shop?”

Hearing the hotel owner’s words, one of Song Wenyun and He Shengchao’s lackeys said with a dark expression.

“This…”

Hearing this, the hotel owner almost cried; his face was filled with grievance.

Being treated like this by Song Wenyun and He Shengchao, he would lose a lot of money; today’s business was probably for nothing.

“Ai! Don’t be rude!”

Seeing his lackey’s actions, He Shengchao raised his hand to stop him.

Then, He Shengchao took out a乾坤bag and poured about several thousand gold coins on the table, saying to the hotel owner: “Boss, are these enough to rent out your entire second floor? Now make those two leave.”

At this moment, everyone on the second floor of the hotel had left except Mo Qingyun and Chilan; they were very noticeable.

Hearing He Shengchao’s words, the hotel owner said hesitantly: “Two gentlemen, I’m sorry. Master Shengchao has rented out the entire second floor; please leave now so I’m not in a difficult position. As compensation, today’s expenses will be free.”

“Boy, did you hear? The boss told you to leave the second floor; hurry up and go.”

Hearing the hotel owner’s words, He Shengchao immediately looked smug and mocked Mo Qingyun.

“Renting out the second floor can make others leave?”

Seeing He Shengchao’s actions, Mo Qingyun’s lips curled up with a playful smile; he took out a乾坤bag from his pocket.

Rattle…

Then, everyone saw gold coins falling out of the乾坤bag.

Soon, a mountain of money appeared beside Mo Qingyun; it was probably hundreds of thousands.

“Is this enough to rent out your entire hotel?”

Mo Qingyun said with a faint smile.

“Yes… yes!”

Seeing the mountain of gold coins, the hotel owner was shocked; he swallowed and said: “These gold coins can not only rent out your entire hotel but also buy the whole inn.”

After replying to Mo Qingyun, the hotel owner started collecting gold coins and said: “Young Master, now this River Inn is yours; you can do whatever you want.”

“Haha, so it is!”

After hearing the hotel owner’s words, Mo Qingyun’s playful smile grew; he looked at Song Wenyun and his group and said playfully: “My inn doesn’t welcome you; leave.”

Not welcoming them, leave!

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, everyone’s expressions changed; they looked at him in shock.

From the current situation, Mo Qingyun was challenging Song Wenyun and He Shengchao.

“This boy is so arrogant; he dares to make Master Shengchao leave.”

“But this boy has too much money; he casually threw out hundreds of thousands of gold coins and bought the entire hotel.”

“Yes, he is domineering, too arrogant, and has a lot of style. If only he liked me.”

“Just you; it’s better for you to be more realistic. I like such domineering, rich, and foolish men.”

…

For a moment, everyone sighed.

“Hmm?”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s actions, Song Wenyun and his group’s expressions darkened; they said to the hotel owner: “Boss, did you not hear what we just said?”

Hearing Song Wenyun’s words, the hotel owner looked apologetic and a little afraid: “Young Masters, I’m just a small businessman; please don’t make it difficult for me. Now this hotel has been bought by this young master at a high price; if you want to eat, please talk to him.”

After saying this, the hotel owner walked aside and prepared to leave.

Song Wenyun and He Shengchao’s expressions darkened when they heard the hotel owner’s words.

Although the hotel owner said this without intention, just expressing his thoughts,

it sounded different to Song Wenyun and He Shengchao; they felt the hotel owner was mocking them.

“You are asking for death!”

This thought appeared in Song Wenyun’s mind; he said to his lackeys: “Drag this guy out and kill him!”

“Yes, Master Wenyun!”

Hearing Song Wenyun’s words, his lackeys immediately responded and surrounded the hotel owner.

Seeing Song Wenyun and his group’s actions, Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened; he said coldly: “In my territory, it’s not your turn to be unruly.”

After saying this, Mo Qingyun moved and struck Song Wenyun’s lackeys with a palm; he sent them flying.

“You can go now.”

After sending Song Wenyun’s lackeys flying, Mo Qingyun waved his hand and told the hotel owner to leave.

He was very satisfied with the hotel owner’s words that squeezed Song Wenyun.

“You are asking for death!”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s actions, Song Wenyun and He Shengchao looked狰狞; they said to Mo Qingyun with gritted teeth: “No matter who you are, today I will break your legs and cripple your cultivation; then make you kneel before me to serve tea.”

“Break my legs, cripple my cultivation, and make me serve you?”

Hearing Song Wenyun’s words, Mo Qingyun smiled playfully and said: “I’ll see how you break my legs and cripple my cultivation to make me serve you.”

“You should thank Master Wenyun’s kindness; if it were me, I would tear you apart and feed the dogs…”

At this moment, one of Song Wenyun’s lackeys said arrogantly.

Puh!

Before he finished speaking, blood spewed from his mouth; he fell to the ground with wide eyes.

Seeing this, everyone’s expressions changed; they looked terrified.

Seeing one of his lackeys killed, Song Wenyun was stunned for a moment; then he said disdainfully to Mo Qingyun: “Boy, I see you dare to be arrogant because there are hidden helpers.”

In his view, the death of this lackey was due to a hidden helper attacking him.

“Hidden helpers?”

Mo Qingyun’s lips curled up with disdain; he said: “You think too highly of yourselves. Dealing with you, it’s not necessary to be so troublesome.”

“Humph! You are quite arrogant.”

Song Wenyun said disdainfully and coldly to his lackeys: “Go break this boy’s legs; I want to see how long those hidden helpers can hide.”

Song Wenyun thought that after dealing with Mo Qingyun, the hidden helpers would be forced out.

“Yes, Master Wenyun!”

Hearing Song Wenyun’s words, his lackeys nodded and surrounded Mo Qingyun.

Bang bang bang…

But to Song Wenyun’s surprise, his lackeys were sent flying by Mo Qingyun as soon as they approached him.

One punch sent four or five people at the First Level of True Qi Realm flying; Mo Qingyun’s cultivation was at least Third Level True Qi Realm.

Seeing this, Song Wenyun’s expression changed; he said in surprise: “Boy, I underestimated you. You have Third Level True Qi Realm cultivation; however, your abilities are still not enough in front of me.”

“Third Level True Qi Realm?”

Hearing Song Wenyun’s words, Mo Qingyun’s lips curled up again with a playful smile; he didn’t argue.

Chapter 131: Then You Die!

“I know who he is!”

At this moment, when Mo Qingyun was facing Song Wenyun and He Shengchao, someone in the hotel shouted loudly.

“Who is he?”

“Who?”

“Hurry… tell us!”

Hearing this person’s words, everyone in the hotel urged him.

After learning Mo Qingyun’s identity, he looked excited and said to everyone: “He… He is Mo Qingyun!”

Mo Qingyun!

It’s him, Mo Qingyun!

Hearing this person’s words, everyone in the hotel was shocked.

Everyone knew that people from He Family and Song Family were trying to capture Mo Qingyun in North Desert Town.

Who would have thought that Mo Qingyun dared to return to North Desert Town; his courage was too great.

“Mo Qingyun?”

Hearing everyone’s words, Song Wenyun and He Shengchao were surprised; then they looked disdainful.

Song Wenyun said with a sneer: “Boy, I didn’t expect you to be Mo Qingyun. Your courage is great; we were worried about not finding you, and you dared to return to North Desert Town.”

“Boy, if I were you, I would have run away with my tail between my legs after seeing us.”

He Shengchao said coldly, “But you dared to provoke us; I think you are tired of living. However, if you want to run away now, it’s too late; we won’t let you escape.”

“Run?”

Hearing Song Wenyun and He Shengchao’s words, Mo Qingyun said disdainfully: “Why should I run? With your strength, you don’t have the qualifications to make me run.”

He Shengchao looked at Mo Qingyun disdainfully and said: “Just talking is useless. It’s only a few months since the Ancestral Worship, and your cultivation was at Second Level True Qi Realm back then. Even if you have extraordinary talent in cultivation, I think your current cultivation should not exceed Fourth Level True Qi Realm.”

“Not exceeding Fourth Level True Qi Realm?”

Hearing He Shengchao’s guess, Mo Qingyun narrowed his eyes; his playful smile grew.

“Just Fourth Level True Qi Realm and dare to be arrogant in front of us; you really don’t know when to stop.”

After saying this, Song Wenyun urged He Shengchao: “Alright, don’t talk to this boy anymore; let’s deal with him and take him back for our master to handle.”

“Alright!”

He Shengchao nodded.

Then, Song Wenyun and He Shengchao attacked Mo Qingyun; they said coldly: “Mo Qingyun, not running away after seeing us is the biggest mistake of your life.”

At this moment, when Song Wenyun and He Shengchao attacked Mo Qingyun, they didn’t summon their martial souls or even use any martial techniques.

This showed how little they thought of Mo Qingyun’s strength.

“You think too highly of yourselves.”

Seeing Song Wenyun and He Shengchao’s actions, Mo Qingyun said disdainfully: “Kneel!”

As he said this, he released the Earth Principle and suppressed Song Wenyun and He Shengchao.

Bang bang!

Facing this sudden heavy pressure, Song Wenyun and He Shengchao lost their balance and fell in front of Mo Qingyun.

“How… how can this be? How did your strength become so strong?”

This unexpected turn made Song Wenyun and He Shengchao change their expressions; they looked panicked.

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s method, they felt a bit of fear towards him.

Nine-layer Collapse

At this moment, when He Shengchao and Song Wenyun were shocked, Mo Qingyun punched them.

Bang bang…

Facing this punch, Song Wenyun and He Shengchao were sent flying; they fell heavily on the ground.

Puh!

After falling, blood spewed from their mouths; their faces turned pale; their breaths weakened rapidly.

“No… no! My dantian, my cultivation…”

Lying on the ground, Song Wenyun and He Shengchao were crazy; they shouted.

Mo Qingyun’s punch had burst their dantians, making them cripples.

Crack!

Before Song Wenyun and He Shengchao could recover from the shock of losing their cultivation, they felt intense pain in their legs.

Their legs were broken by Mo Qingyun at this moment.

“My… my legs!”

Seeing their legs broken, Song Wenyun and He Shengchao went crazy again; their eyes turned bloodshot.

Song Wenyun said crazily to Mo Qingyun: “Mo Qingyun, how you treated us, our master won’t let you off.”

But Mo Qingyun didn’t take his words seriously; he said indifferently: “Don’t worry, after I finish eating, I will take you to see your master.”

After saying this, Mo Qingyun shouted at the waiter downstairs: “Waiter, bring food!”

“Yes, boss!”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, the waiter downstairs looked respectful and responded.

Now that Mo Qingyun had bought the entire inn, these waiters changed their address to him.

Soon, the waiter brought food upstairs.

Seeing the food arrive, Mo Qingyun smiled playfully and said to Song Wenyun and He Shengchao: “You just said you would break my legs, cripple my dantian, and make me serve tea. Now I give you a chance; if you want to live longer, start serving me now.”

“Boy, don’t think so. Even if I die, I won’t serve you tea!”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Song Wenyun raised his head arrogantly and said.

“Then you die.”

Seeing Song Wenyun’s expression, Mo Qingyun’s face darkened; he raised his hand and slashed at him.

Then, a five-meter-long red flame blade condensed in Mo Qingyun’s palm and slashed Song Wenyun, killing him instantly.

Sss!

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s decisive action, everyone in the hotel sucked in a breath; they looked at him with awe.

Mo Qingyun really killed Song Wenyun, and so decisively!

His actions were beyond everyone’s expectations.

Beside him, He Shengchao was frightened; his face turned pale and he trembled; he looked at Mo Qingyun with fear.

Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and asked He Shengchao: “Do you think the same?”

“No… no, I’ll serve you now!”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, He Shengchao endured the pain and came to serve him.

Seeing He Shengchao’s actions, everyone felt a sense of irony; in such a short time, Mo Qingyun and He Shengchao’s statuses were completely reversed.

About half an hour later, Mo Qingyun and Chilan finished eating and drinking.

“Take him; let’s go to the Song and He families.”

Then, Mo Qingyun stood up and told Chilan; he walked downstairs first.

“Yes, Young Master!”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Chilan picked up He Shengchao like a chicken and followed him.

After walking downstairs, Mo Qingyun stopped in front of someone and said playfully: “You just said that Song Wenyun and He Shengchao could easily kill me with a finger?”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, this person turned pale; cold sweat dripped from his forehead; he waved his hand and said: “No… I didn’t mean that. My meaning was that you could kill Song Wenyun and He Shengchao with a finger.”

Hearing this person’s answer, Mo Qingyun looked at him and walked out of the hotel without paying attention to him.

“Too… too terrifying!”

After Mo Qingyun left, this person sat on the ground; his face was pale and he was terrified.

Chapter 132: First, Destroy the He Family (Second Update)

After leaving the hotel, Mo Qingyun went straight to the Song and He families.

Seeing Mo Qingyun leave, some brave people in the hotel secretly followed him.

They wanted to see how Mo Qingyun would act when he reached the Song and He families.

Although Mo Qingyun noticed those following him, he didn’t say much; he let them follow.

Since the He Family was closer to the hotel, Mo Qingyun first arrived at the He Family.

About a quarter of an hour later, Mo Qingyun and his group reached the He Mansion’s gate.

“Who are you?”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s arrival, the guards of the He Family said coldly: “This is the He Family; if you don’t have any business, leave immediately. Otherwise…”

Since He Shengchao was severely beaten by Mo Qingyun, the guards didn’t recognize him.

Before this guard finished speaking, Mo Qingyun struck them with a palm.
