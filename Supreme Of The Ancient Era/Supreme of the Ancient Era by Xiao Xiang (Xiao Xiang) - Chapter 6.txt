This time, when recruiting apprentices for alchemy, a disciple with perfect-grade soul strength appeared.

It was truly astonishing and unexpected.

This is like finding a treasure!

People with perfect-grade soul strength, if no accidents happen, are extremely likely to become high-ranking alchemists.

High-ranking alchemists, in Yun City since ancient times, have never appeared before.

Although he guessed Mo Qingyun's true soul grade, Guan Chuan did not intend to say it directly.

In his view, Mo Qingyun's actions just now were probably because he did not want others to know his true soul strength grade.

Thinking of this, Guan Chuan pressed down the excitement in his heart and looked at Mo Qingyun, saying, "Mo Qingyun, your soul grade is perfect!"

"Perfect! That kid's soul strength is perfect."

"A terrifying talent, even more terrifying than Yue Taowen."

"From this point of view, it is highly possible that this kid will become Master Zhao Qi's direct disciple."

...

After Guan Chuan announced Mo Qingyun’s soul grade, the people around him were filled with envy.

However, when everyone was envious, that old man Guan Chuan showed a flirtatious smile and looked at Mo Qingyun, saying, "Little guy, do you want to be my disciple?"

When Guan Chuan said this, the surroundings suddenly fell silent. Everyone widened their eyes in disbelief.

That old man Guan Chuan actually wanted to take Mo Qingyun as his disciple. He seemed worried that Mo Qingyun would not agree.

Who was Guan Chuan?

Many people here knew him. He was a big figure in the Alchemy Guild, a top-grade second-rank alchemist.

Just one step further and he would become a third-rank alchemist, becoming one of the giants in the Alchemy Guild.

Now, such a person wanted to take Mo Qingyun as his disciple. It was truly astonishing.

People couldn't help but envy Mo Qingyun, this guy had such good luck.

In this way, even if Mo Qingyun couldn't become Master Zhao Qi's direct disciple, becoming Guan Chuan's direct disciple was also a matter worth excitement and joy.

However, at this moment when everyone was shocked by Guan Chuan wanting to take Mo Qingyun as his disciple, several figures suddenly flew down from a high building in the Alchemy Guild and landed beside Mo Qingyun.

When these figures appeared, people quickly recognized their identities.

"That... That's Master Zhao Qi from the Alchemy Guild. Why is he here?"

"Not only Master Zhao Qi, but also President Du Luo and Master Xu Yu. They are all third-rank advanced alchemists."

"The person beside Masters Zhao Qi and Du Luo seems to be Master Xu Yu, a third-rank intermediate alchemist. He's here too."

...

Soon, everyone recognized the identities of the three people beside Mo Qingyun.

After recognizing these three people, everyone was shocked. These big figures they rarely saw were all here now.

"Who would have thought these three old fellows had been hiding and watching from the side all along. It seems this kid is mine no more."

Seeing the three people beside Mo Qingyun, Guan Chuan showed a hint of depression and muttered to himself with a bitter smile.

Of course, he knew the true reason why these three old fellows appeared. It was because they were all coveting Mo Qingyun's talent.

However, it wasn't surprising that they couldn't sit still. A jade with perfect-grade soul strength would make even the Alchemy King and Alchemy Emperor envious.

The three of them didn't pay attention to everyone's gazes.

As soon as they arrived beside Mo Qingyun, they looked at him with greedy eyes, examining him thoroughly.

"Hehe, little guy, you may not know me. Let me introduce myself first. I'm President Du Luo of the Alchemy Guild."

Du Luo rubbed his hands, looking at Mo Qingyun nervously and smilingly said, "Now I want to take you as my direct disciple. Do you agree?"

"What? President Du Luo wants to take Mo Qingyun as his direct disciple?"

Hearing Du Luo's words, everyone was shocked and looked at Mo Qingyun with envy.

President Du Luo. Not only is he a third-rank advanced alchemist like Zhao Qi, but also the president of the Alchemy Guild.

If he becomes his disciple, it would be a meteoric rise.

But before everyone could recover from their shock, they saw Zhao Qi beside Du Luo giving him a glare and saying, "Old fellow, this time it's me recruiting direct disciples. You all don't dare to compete with me."

After scolding Du Luo, Zhao Qi showed a mischievous uncle's smile and looked at Mo Qingyun smilingly saying, "Hehe, little guy, I'm Zhao Qi. This time it's me recruiting direct disciples. Now I want to take you as my direct disciple. Do you agree?"

"Being my disciple has many benefits." Zhao Qi was afraid Mo Qingyun wouldn't agree and promised him again.

Seeing Zhao Qi's actions, the last third-rank intermediate alchemist Xu Yu was a bit nervous and hurriedly squeezed over.

Then, Master Xu Yu took out a red small tripod and said, "Little guy, I'm third-rank intermediate alchemist Xu Yu. This Red Flame Tripod is a middle-grade mystic tripod furnace, which I used when I was a second-rank alchemist. Now I'm giving it to you. If you become my disciple, there will be even more rewards."

The tripod furnaces of alchemists were also divided into grades, just like the weapons of martial artists: ordinary artifacts, mystic artifacts, treasure artifacts, magical artifacts, spirit artifacts, king artifacts, and divine artifacts.

Moreover, each grade was divided into four levels: upper, middle, lower, and top-grade.

After Xu Yu finished speaking, he was afraid Mo Qingyun would refuse and directly stuffed the middle-grade mystic small tripod into Mo Qingyun's hand.

Seeing this scene, everyone was stunned.

Was a middle-grade mystic artifact given away so easily?

When did middle-grade mystic artifacts become so worthless?

However, before everyone could recover from their shock, Zhao Qi beside them glared and took out a pill from his pocket, handing it to Mo Qingyun and saying, "Qingyun, this is a third-rank middle-grade solid pill. For your current cultivation level, it will be of great help. Consider this as my gift for拜师礼 (becoming a disciple)."

"Gift? Is Master Zhao Qi forcing Mo Qingyun to become his disciple?"

Seeing Zhao Qi's actions, everyone around him was dumbfounded and sighed inwardly: "What happened to these big figures today?"

"Old Ghost Zhao, Qingyun hasn't agreed yet and you're shamelessly claiming yourself as his teacher."

After giving Zhao Qi a disdainful look, Du Luo showed a lecherous smile and looked at Mo Qingyun smilingly saying, "Hehe, Qingyun, right? I don't have much to give you. This is my identity token. You can hold it. As long as your requests are not too excessive, the Alchemy Guild will support and satisfy you."

Seeing Du Luo take out his identity token, not only were the people around him stunned but also Zhao Qi, Xu Yu, and Guan Chuan beside him.

Then, Zhao Qi and Xu Yu showed a disdainful look and cursed loudly, "Old Ghost Du Luo, you're too shameless. You're using the Alchemy Guild president's token to deceive Qingyun into becoming your disciple. You're shameless and despicable."

However, Du Luo didn't care about Zhao Qi's curses. He was slightly proud.

Alchemy Guild president's token?

The token Du Luo gave Mo Qingyun just now was the Alchemy Guild president's token.

After hearing Zhao Qi and Xu Yu's words, everyone around him pounded their chests in frustration. They were speechless to the extreme.

Was Du Luo indirectly acknowledging that Mo Qingyun would be the next Alchemy Guild president?

These old fellows had all gone mad. They were so不顾身份 (unmindful of their status) for a disciple.

Everyone had such thoughts unconsciously at this moment.

But the three old fellows didn't care about everyone's thoughts. They still looked at Mo Qingyun nervously, waiting for his answer.

In their view, being able to receive such a disciple in a lifetime was worth it.

Perfect-grade soul strength. Not only in Yun City but even in Qingmu Prefecture, such existence was as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns.

...

Seeing the actions of Du Luo and the three others, everyone around looked at Mo Qingyun with envy.

At this moment, all eyes were on Mo Qingyun.

Everyone held their breath to see how the young man would choose in the end.

Seeing this scene, Mo Qingyun felt a bit helpless. He didn't expect things to turn out like this.

Originally, he just wanted to enter the Alchemy Guild and become a regular member of the Alchemy Guild.

Now it seemed his plan would be in vain.

But Mo Qingyun didn't resist this. After all, it was also a good thing for him.

In this way, his life in Yun City would be much more convenient.

And when the Wu family knew of this identity, they should reposition Mo Feilin.

As for Mo Feilin and Wu Rou's matter, they should not obstruct too much.

Mo Qingyun guessed correctly. When Wu Qing saw this scene,

She looked at Mo Qingyun with no more mockery and disdain, a hint of fear in her eyes.

Although Mo Qingyun's strength wasn't strong and his background wasn't big, that was in the past.

Now, if Mo Qingyun chose one of these three old fellows, his background and identity would change dramatically.

Moreover, with Mo Qingyun's alchemy talent, it was hard for him not to achieve something in the future.

Often times, when a person's talent is strong enough, it can also make people feel fear.

At this moment, when everyone was eagerly waiting, Mo Qingyun spoke up and replied to the three elders, "Elders, this matter is significant. I need to go back and ask my family elders."

Go back and ask his family elders?

Hearing Mo Qingyun's answer, everyone was stunned.

They didn't expect him to give such an answer. This result surprised them greatly.

If it were a common person, they would probably eagerly reply without hesitation.

Hearing Mo Qingyun's answer, Du Luo and the three others were also surprised but looked at him with more interest.

Anyone could see that the affection these elders had for Mo Qingyun was even greater now.

In Du Luo's view, if it were a common youth in such circumstances, they would probably lose their composure.

But now Mo Qingyun's answer showed that he was calm and emotionless, like a mirror reflecting clearly.

This indicated that Mo Qingyun had more maturity and resilience than his peers.

"Very good, very good. This matter is indeed significant. You should go back and have a thorough talk with your elders."

Then, Du Luo and the three others nodded repeatedly, looking at Mo Qingyun with admiration.

"You can not only talk to your elders but also invite them here. As a teacher, I should have a face-to-face talk with them." Du Luo added.

Hearing Du Luo's words, Zhao Qi and Xu Yu beside him were furious. They shouted at Du Luo, "Old fellow, what right do you have to talk with Qingyun's elders? He is my disciple. I should be the one talking."

"Right, it should be me talking with them. After all, I'm his teacher." Xu Yu also said without yielding.

Then, the three old fellows started blowing their beards and glaring at each other.

Seeing this, everyone was stunned.

Were these the grand masters in their hearts?

Looking at the three elders' actions, Guan Chuan showed a bitter smile and walked up saying, "President, two elders, there are still some young ones to test their soul strength. Can you postpone the matter of taking Qingyun as a disciple?"

"Hmph!"

Hearing Guan Chuan's words, Du Luo and the three others looked at each other and walked away with a cold snort.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun and Guan Chuan both smiled bitterly and walked to the side.

Perhaps because of what Mo Qingyun had just experienced, the subsequent soul strength tests became rather dull.

Of course, mainly because most of them had weak talents. Occasionally, there were a few with middle-grade soul strength.

In this way, about an hour later, everyone finished the tests.

After testing all personnel, there were a total of two hundred and thirty-seven people who met the requirements, far exceeding the Alchemy Guild's one hundred quota.

Seeing this, Guan Chuan was not surprised and said, "Congratulations on entering the third round of tests. Next, we will prepare some materials for you and rank you based on the quality of the pills you make. The top one hundred will be admitted."

Alchemy!

Hearing Guan Chuan's words, everyone's expressions changed. Some looked worried and nervous.

Others showed pride and satisfaction. For example, Yue Taowen looked arrogant after hearing this.

In his view, in terms of alchemy, he was sure to win first place.

While feeling proud, Yue Taowen looked at Mo Qingyun arrogantly and said, "Kid, although your soul talent is outstanding, alchemy requires accumulated experience. During the alchemy process, I will definitely defeat you and win first place."

Hearing Yue Taowen's words, everyone's expressions changed. They looked at Mo Qingyun with a mix of envy and malice.

Yue Taowen was the genius of the Yue family, one of Yun City's top families.

Mo Qingyun had offended Yue Taowen. Even with the Alchemy Guild supporting him, his future would not be easy.

Moreover, if Mo Qingyun's alchemy skills were poor in the next round, his status among the three elders would drop significantly.

"Who do you think has better alchemy skills, that kid or Yue Taowen?"

"Do we need to ask? Of course it's Yue Taowen. He is a first-rank alchemist."

"In my opinion, even if we compare him with anyone here, he is weaker."

"Maybe he will make a lump of dung next. Will the three masters still take him as their disciple then?"

"If he doesn't become a disciple of the three masters because of this, he will regret not agreeing directly."

"He has to pay a price for showing off."

...

Seeing Yue Taowen and Mo Qingyun facing each other, those who were eliminated looked at them with sour grapes.

At this moment, not only did the people around look curious and expectant but also Du Luo and the three others.

"Can this little guy make a first-rank pill?" Du Luo said with anticipation.

"It might be difficult. He is still young, around fifteen or sixteen years old. Many people of this age are just familiarizing themselves with medicinal materials." Zhao Qi said seriously.

"I'm also a bit worried. He hasn't even touched alchemy before." Xu Yu said with concern, "This makes the third round of selection unfair for him."

Hearing Xu Yu's words, Du Luo and the three others fell silent, each with their own thoughts.

After a moment of silence, Zhao Qi spoke up first, "No matter what, I've already decided on this kid. His alchemy skills can be cultivated, but his soul talent is unchangeable."

Hearing Zhao Qi's words, Du Luo panicked and said, "Old fellow, if this kid doesn't pass the next round, it means he's not qualified. Then you won't have the right to recruit him."

Then Xu Yu also said with a playful smile, "In that case, I hope this kid performs worse in the third round."

Hearing the three elders' words, Guan Chuan's forehead was covered with cold sweat. These old fellows were completely at a loss.

Moreover, if Mo Qingyun heard the three elders' words, he would probably be speechless too.

Those two wanted him to become their disciple and hoped he performed worse. Was this really good?

...

Soon, the materials and tripod furnaces for alchemy were sent up by the Alchemy Guild.

"These are the materials to make a first-rank Blood Vitality Pill. The time limit is three hours."

Seeing the materials and tripod furnaces prepared, Guan Chuan's expression turned serious. He said to everyone below, "Three hours later, we will rank you based on the quality of your pills."

Hearing Guan Chuan's words, many people no longer hesitated and started making the pills.

While everyone was busy, Yue Taowen also began to make his pill. However, when he started, he looked at Mo Qingyun arrogantly and said, "Kid, watch carefully. Let me show you what alchemy is."

As Yue Taowen's words fell, Mo Qingyun saw a red stone appear in his hand.

When Yue Taowen took out this red stone, it immediately emitted scorching air and slowly condensed into a ball of red flame.

"Earth Flame Stone!"

Seeing the stone in Yue Taowen's hand, Mo Qingyun's expression changed slightly and said in surprise, "I didn't expect Yue Taowen to have such a thing. No wonder he has the confidence to take first place."

Earth Flame Stone was a very rare stone, coming from underground lava and condensed from pure flames.

After refining it, alchemists could use it to more easily control the size of the flame and improve the quality of the pill.

Seeing that Mo Qingyun recognized the Earth Flame Stone, Yue Taowen's expression changed and said in surprise, "You actually recognize the Earth Flame Stone. You have some knowledge. Now you should know how big the gap is between us."

"Big gap?"

Mo Qingyun nodded and looked at Yue Taowen disdainfully, "With the help of the Earth Flame Stone, you can only make a first-rank pill. In my view, without this stone, any one here has stronger alchemy skills than you."

"Any one is better than me? You mean your alchemy skills are also better than mine?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, Yue Taowen's face darkened and said through gritted teeth, "Kid, let me see how your alchemy skills are better than mine."

"Then you watch carefully."

Hearing Yue Taowen's words, Mo Qingyun didn't say much and started making the pill.

Bang!

Then everyone saw a dragon-shaped flame appear in Mo Qingyun's palm.

This was the method Mo Qingyun mastered after becoming a Pill King in his previous life, converting the power of the Red Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul to assist with alchemy.

"That's...妖火 (demon fire)?"

Seeing the dragon-shaped flame in Mo Qingyun's hand, Du Luo and the three others were shocked. They stood up excitedly from their chairs.

Du Luo and the three others were only low-rank alchemists. They couldn't tell that Mo Qingyun's dragon-shaped flame was converted from martial soul power.

In their view, this should be a kind of demon fire in the body of some powerful fire-type beast that Mo Qingyun obtained by chance.

Demon fire was a kind of flame condensed in the body of some powerful fire-type beasts. After refining it, one could use it to assist with alchemy.

Although both demon fire and Earth Flame Stone could help with alchemy, there was a fundamental difference between them.

That is to say, after refining demon fire, it would become part of one's instinct and wouldn't be like the Earth Flame Stone which was just a treasure.

Therefore, many alchemists were eager to obtain demon fire.

But obtaining demon fire wasn't easy. It was something that could only be obtained by chance.

That's why Du Luo and the three others were so shocked when they saw Mo Qingyun's flame.

They really didn't expect him to have demon fire.

"This should be the demon fire from a sub-dragon beast. I didn't expect this little guy to have such good luck."

Zhao Qi said in amazement, "Sub-dragon beasts are the weakest but comparable to the realm of Nascent Soul. I really don't know how this little guy got this demon fire. He truly has great fortune."

"With the help of this demon fire, there's a 90% chance that this little guy will become a high-rank alchemist. He might even become a Pill King." Xu Yu said excitedly, "This little guy really surprises us. He brings too many surprises."

Pill King!

Thinking of this, Du Luo and the three others were excited.

If they could cultivate a Pill King, it would be their pride for life and make them feel no regrets.

"Huh! It seems Mo Qingyun has mastered a kind of flame. That flame looks pretty strong."

"It does look good, but can it really help with alchemy?"

"If it doesn't help with alchemy, it's just showing off."

...

Compared to Du Luo and the three others' knowledge, those around were a bit lacking. They only looked at Mo Qingyun curiously.

"Qingyun, is he really the wastrel that Mo Family talks about?"

Looking at Mo Qingyun who had summoned his martial soul flame, Mo Feilin was excited. He clenched his fists tightly.

These days, Mo Qingyun had brought him too many surprises.

Firstly, he concocted the Foundation Establishment Liquid and broke through his cultivation level to win first place in the monthly competition for ordinary young ones, making a name for himself.

Now, he was surprising everyone again in the Alchemy Guild's recruitment competition with his outstanding talent.

If Mo Feilin hadn't seen it himself, he wouldn't have believed it.

Because everything was too surprising and happened so suddenly.

"Flylin's nephew is really a surprise."

Seeing Mo Qingyun's performance, Wu Rou's eyes sparkled with light. She looked at Mo Feilin with a gentle gaze.

"This wild kid, is he really Flylin's nephew? How could such a prodigy come from that countryside?"

Seeing Mo Qingyun show surprising abilities again and again, Wu Qing was terrified to the extreme.

If she hadn't known beforehand that Mo Qingyun was Flylin's nephew, she wouldn't have believed he came from the remote Beimozhen.

At this moment, when everyone was shocked by Mo Qingyun's actions,

His hands seemed to have magic as he skillfully put the materials into the tripod furnace.

When Mo Qingyun put the materials into the tripod furnace, they seemed to come alive.

They danced like dragonflies on water in the tripod furnace.

Seeing this, Du Luo and the three others widened their eyes in disbelief. They couldn't believe what they saw.

Others might not recognize the technique Mo Qingyun was using, but they could see it clearly.

Dragonfly on Water Technique!

The technique Mo Qingyun was using now was a very advanced alchemy technique, the Dragonfly on Water Technique.

Although ordinary second-rank alchemists could master this technique, they didn't use it as skillfully as Mo Qingyun.

Now, the proficiency of Mo Qingyun's technique was on par with these old fellows.

"Is this kid really fifteen or sixteen years old?"

Seeing Mo Qingyun's performance, Du Luo and the three others felt defeated. They felt they had lived in vain.

But after a brief defeat, their gazes towards Mo Qingyun became excited and passionate again.

Originally, they thought Mo Qingyun's alchemy talent was already very high. But now they realized that they had underestimated his talent.

"Look, Yue Taowen has successfully made the Blood Vitality Pill. It's so fast, only half an hour."

"It seems that first place will definitely be Yue Taowen's this time."

Seeing Yue Taowen successfully make the Blood Vitality Pill, everyone looked at him with awe.

Under everyone's admiring and worshipful gazes,

Yue Taowen walked to Guan Chuan with the successfully made Blood Vitality Pill and said, "Elder Guan Chuan, this is the Blood Vitality Pill I made. Please check it."

Then Guan Chuan checked Yue Taowen's Blood Vitality Pill and nodded with a faint smile, saying, "Not bad. It's first-rank middle-grade."

First-rank middle-grade!

Hearing Guan Chuan's words, everyone was shocked. They looked at Yue Taowen with awe.

Yue Taowen could make a first-rank middle-grade pill at only twenty years old. It was truly amazing.

Under everyone's gazes, Yue Taowen looked at Mo Qingyun who was still making the pill arrogantly and said, "Now do you still think your alchemy skills are better than mine?"

"Is first-rank middle-grade impressive?"

Hearing Yue Taowen's words, Mo Qingyun replied indifferently and said lightly, "Don't be in a hurry. Wait until I finish making the pill."

...

"Hmph! Let's see what kind of pills you can make."

Yue Taowen's expression darkened and he said with a cold snort before walking to the side.

Mo Qingyun didn't pay attention to Yue Taowen's performance and focused entirely on alchemy.

In this way, time passed bit by bit.

Gradually, other people started successfully making their pills too.

However, the quality of their Blood Vitality Pills was inferior to Yue Taowen's first-rank middle-grade.

Some people's pills were even not up to the standard of a first-rank pill, only quasi-first-grade.

Seeing that their pills were inferior to his, Yue Taowen looked smug.

Looking at Mo Qingyun who was still making the pill, the smugness on Yue Taowen's face deepened. He looked at Mo Qingyun coldly and said, "Kid, do you think you can make a pill by dragging time?"

"Dragging time?"

Hearing Yue Taowen's words, Mo Qingyun curled his lips and said with a playful smile, "Since you're so eager to be embarrassed, I'll make it happen for you."

As Mo Qingyun's words fell, a rich aroma of pills spread from his tripod furnace.

This was the sign that the pill had been successfully made.

Soon, Mo Qingyun raised his hand and scooped up nine pills from the tripod furnace.

Nine!

Mo Qingyun made nine Blood Vitality Pills in one batch.

Seeing this, everyone's expressions changed. They looked shocked.

They were exhausted to make just one pill in a batch and still worried about failure.

But Mo Qingyun made nine in one batch. It was truly extraordinary.

"Nine!"

Seeing that Mo Qingyun made nine pills in a batch, Yue Taowen's face turned red. He said in shock like he had eaten something bad, "N... Not possible. How can he make nine pills in a batch? He must be cheating."

"Kid, you must be cheating. You can't make nine Blood Vitality Pills in a batch."

Hearing Yue Taowen's words, Mo Qingyun said disdainfully, "Just because you can't do it doesn't mean others can't. I thought you were just a mediocre alchemist, but now I see your temperament is even worse."

"Others being better than you means cheating. But you being better than others isn't cheating?"

Mo Qingyun looked at Yue Taowen disdainfully and said, "Since you're so eager to be embarrassed, I'll make it happen for you."

After a few words with Yue Taowen, Mo Qingyun took the Blood Vitality Pills to Guan Chuan and said solemnly, "Please check them, Elder Guan Chuan."

"Hmm!"

Guan Chuan nodded and took the Blood Vitality Pills from Mo Qingyun's hand, examining them carefully.

Just a glance and Guan Chuan was shocked. He said in surprise, "First-rank top-grade! All nine are first-rank top-grade Blood Vitality Pills."

After a brief shock, Elder Guan Chuan sorted out his emotions and looked at Mo Qingyun with a complex expression, "All nine Blood Vitality Pills are first-rank top-grade quality."

As Elder Guan Chuan's words fell, the surroundings became noisy.

"First-rank top-grade! Mo Qingyun made first-rank top-grade Blood Vitality Pills."

"This guy is really extraordinary. Not only making nine pills in a batch but all first-rank top-grade."

"Is this guy really sixteen years old? His alchemy skills are comparable to a second-rank alchemist."

...

Those competing for the Alchemy Guild's apprentice positions were all depressed.

"Haha, good disciple. You did well and didn't disappoint me."

Seeing Mo Qingyun's performance, Zhao Qi said excitedly. It seemed like he was proud of Mo Qingyun.

But was it really his doing?

"Old Ghost Zhao, can you be any more shameless?"

Seeing Zhao Qi's expression, Du Luo looked at him disdainfully and said, "My disciple can do this. What does it have to do with you? It's clearly my achievement."

"You guys don't argue, this is clearly my achievement!"

Xu Yu also said without yielding.

Then the three old fellows started blowing their beards and glaring at each other again, not giving in.

Seeing Zhao Qi's three others' actions, Guan Chuan was speechless. He sighed inwardly: "It seems it has nothing to do with you three."

Of course, Guan Chuan didn't dare say this out loud. He could only sigh in his heart.

"First-rank top-grade! Qingyun actually made first-rank top-grade pills."

After knowing the quality of Mo Qingyun's Blood Vitality Pills, Mo Feilin felt like he was about to faint from happiness.

He never expected that Mo Qingyun could make first-rank top-grade pills. He originally thought that if Mo Qingyun made quasi-first-grade Blood Vitality Pills, it would be great.

"Does this mean that Qingyun is now a first-rank top-grade alchemist?"

Thinking about it, Mo Feilin's eyes lit up. He said in admiration, "This little monkey has made us suffer so much. How many secrets does this kid have?"

"First-rank top-grade! Flylin's nephew is really extraordinary. If he really helps us..."

Wu Rou thought that if Mo Qingyun helped, she and Mo Feilin might break through their family's obstruction.

"This kid is actually a first-rank top-grade alchemist. I talked to him like that before..."

After seeing Mo Qingyun's true abilities, Wu Qing felt a chill. She couldn't help but take a deep breath: "Sss... What if he takes revenge on me next?"

The difference between a first-rank top-grade alchemist and a first-rank initial-grade alchemist was very big.

A first-rank initial-grade alchemist, Wu Qing's family didn't need to take seriously. But if it was a first-rank top-grade, they had to be cautious.

Moreover, Mo Qingyun was such a young first-rank top-grade alchemist.

Thinking that she had offended such a young first-rank top-grade alchemist, Wu Qing regretted it to the point of turning green.

"Find Mo Feilin. Yes, ask him for help..."

After a brief panic, Wu Qing looked at Mo Feilin hopefully.

As Mo Qingyun made first-rank top-grade Blood Vitality Pills, everyone's gazes towards him changed again.

In this way, time passed bit by bit. Soon three hours were up.

The third round of alchemy test ended, and the ranking began.

With Mo Qingyun's perfect-grade soul strength and first-rank top-grade Blood Vitality Pills, he naturally ranked first.

As for second place, it was naturally Yue Taowen's.

But everyone knew that after seeing Mo Qingyun's extraordinary performance, the second place and one hundredth place were not much different.
