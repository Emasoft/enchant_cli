“Your array formation was actually broken by you!”

Seeing this, the Nine Palaces Elder’s expression immediately changed, feeling shocked beyond belief.

However, when he saw Mo Qingyun's purple pupils, his expression became even more shocked, exclaiming in astonishment: “Heaven… Heaven Soul Demon Pupil!”

“Are you… a member of the Heaven Soul Clan?”

The Nine Palaces Elder’s face was filled with fear, and in his eyes, Mo Qingyun seemed like a terrifying existence.

“Heaven Soul Clan?”

Hearing the Nine Palaces Elder’s words, Mo Qingyun became even more puzzled, as these words left him feeling bewildered.

“No soul star凝聚!”

As Mo Qingyun was puzzled, the Nine Palaces Elder’s expression suddenly changed, revealing a hint of joy. He no longer looked at Mo Qingyun with fear.

Instead, the Nine Palaces Elder’s smile now seemed even more pronounced. He looked at Mo Qingyun coldly and said, “So your Heaven Soul Demon Pupil hasn’t awakened yet. With such a state, you’re not my match. Boy, just let me possess your body.”

After the Nine Palaces Elder spoke, he attacked Mo Qingyun again, drawing an array formation in empty space and sending it towards him.

Tong Power Ray!

Seeing the Nine Palaces Elder attack, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and emitted another Tong Power Ray to stop him from drawing the array formation.

“You haven’t awakened your Heaven Soul Demon Pupil yet, so your eyes have limited power. Let’s see how many times you can stop me.”

Seeing Mo Qingyun continuously use the Tong Power Ray, the Nine Palaces Elder’s smile became even more sinister.

“Old man, you’re too happy too soon.”

Hearing the Nine Palaces Elder’s boastful words, Mo Qingyun sneered and said disdainfully.

Light Gate Spirit Soul, manifest!

Sealed Door!

As Mo Qingyun spoke, he summoned his Light Gate Spirit Soul and used its spirit soul technique.

The spirit soul technique transformed into a miniature light gate, rapidly rushing towards the Nine Palaces Elder.

What kind of attack is this?

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s move, the Nine Palaces Elder’s expression changed, somewhat surprised by his methods.

Pfft!

Just as the Nine Palaces Elder showed surprise, the Sealed Door directly struck his body and sealed his soul.

Sealing the soul is an advanced ability of the Sealed Door spirit soul technique.

With his soul sealed, the Nine Palaces Elder’s aura rapidly weakened.

In no time, the Nine Palaces Elder’s aura had declined to the peak of the Virtual Form Realm.

“How… could this happen!”

Seeing this, the Nine Palaces Elder’s expression changed, feeling terrified.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun’s methods were something he had never heard of or seen before; they were truly bizarre.

“Old man, now I want to see what other tricks you have!”

After sealing the Nine Palaces Elder’s spirit soul, Mo Qingyun no longer hesitated and attacked him again.

Soul Heaven Seal

As Mo Qingyun spoke, he summoned twenty-seven soul battle seals and sent them towards the Nine Palaces Elder.

Since the Nine Palaces Elder was a soul body, attacking him with soul attacks would be more effective.

“Brother… please spare me!”

Seeing the soul battle seals approaching, the Nine Palaces Elder immediately submitted and pleaded with Mo Qingyun.

He had no choice but to submit; he felt that if those Soul Heaven Seals hit him, even if he didn’t die, he would lose a layer of skin.

Hearing the Nine Palaces Elder’s words, Mo Qingyun stopped his actions and said coldly: “Give me a reason not to kill you.”

“… I can become your Star General!”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, the Nine Palaces Elder gritted his teeth and made a difficult decision.

After all, once he became Mo Qingyun’s Star General, it would mean putting his life in Mo Qingyun’s hands.

Making such a decision was very difficult for anyone.

However, at this moment, the Nine Palaces Elder could not care less about his dignity and face.

For a creature like him, who had lived for countless years, what kind of scenes hadn’t he seen? His face wasn’t that important to him.

“Star General?”

Hearing the Nine Palaces Elder’s words, Mo Qingyun’s expression changed slightly and asked curiously: “What is a Star General?”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, the Nine Palaces Elder immediately looked at him in surprise and exclaimed: “You… don’t know what a Star General is?”

Mo Qingyun’s words truly shocked the Nine Palaces Elder, making him feel that it was unbelievable.

Capturing Star Generals is a天赋ability of the Heaven Soul Clan, and Mo Qingyun didn’t even know about it.

Was he a qualified member of the Heaven Soul Clan?

If the Nine Palaces Elder knew that Mo Qingyun’s Heaven Soul Demon Pupil was obtained through refining an Eye Demon, he wouldn’t have such an expression.

“Mm.”

In response to the Nine Palaces Elder’s question, Mo Qingyun nodded and said curiously: “Tell me about the Heaven Soul Clan and what a Star General is. If your answer satisfies me, I’ll spare you.”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, the Nine Palaces Elder’s expression changed slightly and he involuntarily revealed a bitter smile.

He never thought that one day, he would be threatened by a young man at the True Essence Realm.

But now, circumstances were against him and he had no choice but to endure it.

After all, preserving his life was the key.

Slightly adjusting his emotions, the Nine Palaces Elder said: “The Heaven Soul Clan is one of the top hundred powerful races on the Barbarian Continent. Once their Heaven Soul Demon Pupil awakens, they can凝聚soul stars and open soul palaces. The stronger the bloodline of a Heaven Soul Clan member, the more soul palaces they can open. The most pure-blooded royal members of the Heaven Soul Clan can reach nine stars and eighteen palaces. My previous master was a member who reached this level.”

“As for Star Generals…”

The Nine Palaces Elder paused and revealed a bitter expression, then continued: “Star Generals are servants who are enslaved and imprisoned in the eighteen soul palaces by members of the Heaven Soul Clan.”

From his expression, it was clear that he felt some inferiority and helplessness about the Star General status.

“Soul stars, nine stars eighteen palaces…”

After hearing the Nine Palaces Elder’s words, Mo Qingyun felt a wave of shock. All this information was beyond his understanding.

“What is the Heaven Soul Clan? And what is the Barbarian Continent?”

At this moment, Mo Qingyun’s heart was filled with curiosity and anticipation for everything the Nine Palaces Elder mentioned.

After a brief moment of excitement, Mo Qingyun began to ponder. He thought: “My Heaven Soul Demon Pupil was refined from an Eye Demon, so the Eye Demons should have some connection with the Heaven Soul Clan. The mysterious eyelashes must also be related to the members of the Heaven Soul Clan, which means that the Hundred Kingdoms Battlefield might have some connection with the Heaven Soul Clan and the Barbarian Continent.”

With this thought, Mo Qingyun’s heart was filled with surprise, his heartbeat quickening.

At the same time, his curiosity reached an unprecedented level.

“Someday, I must go to the Barbarian Continent and see for myself what the Heaven Soul Clan is like.”

At this moment, Mo Qingyun’s face showed determination as he clenched his fist and made a decision in his heart.

After a brief silence, Mo Qingyun looked at the Nine Palaces Elder again and said coldly: “You want to become my Star General, but according to what you said, I need to open a soul palace first in order to capture a Star General. Since I haven’t opened one yet, it seems that I can’t make you my Star General.”

Mo Qingyun’s face showed a cold expression and continued: “If that’s the case, keeping you by my side would be a potential threat. This isn’t something good for me.”

“Brother… please wait, listen to me!”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words and sensing his killing intent, the Nine Palaces Elder hurriedly said: “If I become your Star General, all my skills can be used by you. That means that if you capture me as your Star General, it’s like having an extra person to help you research array formations.”

“Is that so!”

Hearing the Nine Palaces Elder’s words, Mo Qingyun’s eyes lit up and he felt a bit excited.

If it was as the Nine Palaces Elder said, capturing him would be like having an extra person to help him research array formations.

Such a good thing was hard to find.

“The Heaven Soul Clan is so powerful!”

Mo Qingyun’s heart filled with excitement as he thought: “Moreover, if I can reach the level of nine stars and eighteen palaces, it means that I could capture eighteen Star Generals and have eighteen abilities. It’s like having eighteen people cultivating for me.”

His heart began to race as he thought about this.

Wow, one person is equivalent to eighteen people cultivating and mastering eighteen skills. It’s hard not to be impressive.

Mo Qingyun thought that if he could control the Nine Palaces Elder, he wouldn’t want to kill him.

After all, having a person who can draw array formations in empty space by his side was something rare.

Now that the Nine Palaces Elder had said this, Mo Qingyun felt even more excited and didn’t want to kill him.

Furthermore, according to the Nine Palaces Elder’s words, if he made him his Star General, it would mean that he could also draw array formations in empty space.

Thinking about this made Mo Qingyun even more excited and full of anticipation.

However, Mo Qingyun didn’t immediately agree to spare the Nine Palaces Elder’s life.

After all, although what the Nine Palaces Elder said was tempting, if he couldn’t completely control him, Mo Qingyun didn’t want to have a potential threat by his side.

“What you said is indeed tempting, I must admit that it made me a bit excited.”

Mo Qingyun looked at the Nine Palaces Elder calmly and said coldly: “But all this is based on me opening a soul palace and making you my Star General. Since I haven’t awakened my eye pupil and opened a soul palace, it’s too dangerous to keep you by my side. I don’t want to take that risk.”

After saying this, Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened and he released his killing intent again.

“Brother… please wait, listen to me!”

Seeing Mo Qingyun about to attack again, the Nine Palaces Elder’s expression changed and he said: “I have a technique called Soul Capture Seal. By planting my soul seal in someone’s soul, I can control their life and death without worrying about them rebelling.”

“Oh? There is such a technique!”

Hearing the Nine Palaces Elder’s words, Mo Qingyun was surprised and revealed an expression of surprise. He thought: “So the Soul Capture Seal is similar to the Blood Slave technique used by Quan Lian.”

After muttering this, Mo Qingyun said coldly to the Nine Palaces Elder: “Give me the Soul Capture Seal technique. If what you say is true, I’ll spare your life.”

After that, the Nine Palaces Elder transmitted the Soul Capture Seal technique into Mo Qingyun’s mind for him to verify.

After verifying it, Mo Qingyun confirmed its authenticity and followed the instructions in the technique to plant his Soul Capture Seal into the Nine Palaces Elder’s soul.

After planting the Soul Capture Seal, Mo Qingyun and the Nine Palaces Elder formed a connection.

This connection was even stronger than his with Quan Lian, making communication between them more convenient.

From this, it seemed that the Soul Capture Seal was even more advanced than Quan Lian’s Blood Slave technique.

“Old servant, I pay my respects to the master.”

After Mo Qingyun planted the Soul Capture Seal in him, the Nine Palaces Elder showed a respectful expression and bowed to Mo Qingyun.

“Stand up first.”

Seeing the Nine Palaces Elder’s bow, Mo Qingyun waved his hand and said: “My name is Mo Qingyun. From now on, you can call me Young Master or Qingyun Young Master…”

Mo Qingyun told the Nine Palaces Elder some of his identity.

“Yes, Young Master!”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, the Nine Palaces Elder nodded and stood respectfully in front of him, waiting for his orders.

Sealed Door, release!

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun pointed at the Nine Palaces Elder and released his seal.

After that, the Nine Palaces Elder’s cultivation recovered quickly, reaching the half-step Heaven Spirit Realm in no time.

Seeing this, the Nine Palaces Elder’s expression changed and he looked at Mo Qingyun in shock.

After releasing the seal on the Nine Palaces Elder, Mo Qingyun talked to him about some things related to the Barbarian Continent and the Heaven Soul Clan.

However, Mo Qingyun was disappointed that the Nine Palaces Elder had forgotten many memories due to living in a soul state for too long.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun stopped asking and continued refining the Nine Palaces Array Disk.

When he saw that Mo Qingyun was going to refine the Nine Palaces Array Disk, the Nine Palaces Elder turned into a white light and returned to the Nine Palaces Array Disk, helping Mo Qingyun refine it.

The Nine Palaces Array Disk had nine positions, each with an array base. To refine the Nine Palaces Array Disk, one needed to first refine the nine array bases.

With the help of the Nine Palaces Elder, Mo Qingyun didn’t find it too difficult to refine the array bases.

Mo Qingyun infused his essence energy into the Nine Palaces Array Disk and began to control it, refining one of the array bases.

As Mo Qingyun started refining the array base, the symbols on it emitted dazzling light and kept flickering.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun controlled his essence energy to penetrate into the flashing symbols.

As the essence energy seeped into the array base’s symbols, Mo Qingyun and the Nine Palaces Array Disk formed a connection.

After this discovery, Mo Qingyun no longer hesitated and fully controlled his essence energy to penetrate the array base’s symbols, refining all nine positions.

Five days later.

The symbols on the Nine Palaces Array Disk’s array bases were all refined by Mo Qingyun.

He finally refined the Nine Palaces Array Disk.

After refining it, Mo Qingyun found that many array formations were inscribed within the Nine Palaces Array Disk.

These array formations in the disk were like twinkling stars in a vast starry sky, shining within the Nine Palaces Array Disk.

Looking at these array formation light points, Mo Qingyun released a bit of his soul energy and sensed one of the array formations.

Clang!

Under Mo Qingyun’s soul energy, this array formation light point suddenly shone brightly and flashed with array patterns.

Soon, a miniature version of the array formation appeared in Mo Qingyun’s vision.

“This is the Thousand Dreams Illusion Array!”

Seeing this miniature array formation, Mo Qingyun’s expression changed and he felt a wave of shock.

He had seen this array formation in his previous life, and it was very terrifying.

Once trapped within it, one would forever be in a dream-like state, unable to distinguish between dreams and reality until they died within the array.

“Young Master, you actually recognize this Thousand Dreams Illusion Array!”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, the Nine Palaces Elder’s expression changed and he was somewhat surprised by his recognition.

“Young Master, what are these array formations in the Nine Palaces Array Disk?”

Hearing the Nine Palaces Elder’s words, Mo Qingyun showed a puzzled expression and asked him.

“Revered Young Master, these array formations in the Nine Palaces Array Disk were inscribed by me.” The Nine Palaces Elder responded solemnly.

After responding, the Nine Palaces Elder sighed and said somewhat helplessly: “But my cultivation has declined too much. With my current cultivation, I can no longer activate many of the array formations in the Nine Palaces Array Disk.”

Hearing the Nine Palaces Elder’s words, Mo Qingyun’s expression changed and he understood his meaning.

He thought that if the Nine Palaces Elder’s cultivation hadn’t declined so much, he might have been in trouble now.

After a moment of thought, Mo Qingyun said: “Now that I have refined the Nine Palaces Array Disk, can I activate these array formations?”

“Revered Young Master, theoretically it’s not possible.”

The Nine Palaces Elder responded and then said: “But since your soul cultivation is insufficient, just like mine, you can’t activate many of the array formations in the Nine Palaces Array Disk either.”

“So it’s like that!”

Hearing the Nine Palaces Elder’s words, Mo Qingyun frowned and understood his meaning.

Then he asked the Nine Palaces Elder with a slightly furrowed brow: “Nine Palaces, is there a Time Shift Array in the Nine Palaces Array Disk?”

“Time Shift Array?”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, the Nine Palaces Elder frowned slightly and thought for a moment before saying: “There is a Time Shift Array, but with my current cultivation, I can only activate the three-times speed version for you.”

“Three-times speed Time Shift Array!”

Hearing the Nine Palaces Elder’s words, Mo Qingyun’s eyes lit up and he revealed a hint of surprise. He thought: “That means three days in the array is equivalent to one day outside, although it’s not a great acceleration, it’s better than nothing.”

After feeling slightly pleased in his heart, Mo Qingyun thought for a moment and said: “Nine Palaces, if we perform soul fusion, how many times speed can you activate the Time Shift Array?”

The Nine Palaces Elder showed a thoughtful expression and responded to Mo Qingyun: “Young Master, your soul cultivation is at the middle True Essence Realm. If we work together, we should be able to activate a five-times speed Time Shift Array.”

“Five-times speed Time Shift Array?”

Hearing the Nine Palaces Elder’s answer, Mo Qingyun’s expression brightened and he immediately said: “Let’s start soul fusion now. Help me activate the five-times speed Time Shift Array.”

“Alright!”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, the Nine Palaces Elder nodded and began soul fusion with him.

After that, Mo Qingyun activated the five-times speed Time Shift Array.

Soon, a silver light emerged from the Nine Palaces Array Disk and enveloped Mo Qingyun.

This was the Time Shift Array.

On the silver curtain of the Time Shift Array, there were occasional streaks of light, as if time was flowing. It was incredibly mysterious.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun showed a pleased expression and thought: “With the Time Shift Array, my cultivation speed will increase fivefold. This way, I can recover to my previous life’s level much faster.”

Thinking this, Mo Qingyun pondered again and thought: “If I can increase Nine Palaces’ cultivation a bit, could he activate an even stronger Time Shift Array? With his current half-step Heaven Spirit Realm cultivation, reaching the Heaven Spirit Realm shouldn’t be too difficult.”

With this thought in mind, Mo Qingyun no longer hesitated and asked the Nine Palaces Elder: “Nine Palaces, if your cultivation reaches Heaven Spirit Realm, how many times speed can you activate the Time Shift Array?”

The Nine Palaces Elder thought for a moment and said: “Revered Young Master, if my cultivation reaches Heaven Spirit Realm, I should be able to activate an eight-times speed Time Shift Array.”

After responding, the Nine Palaces Elder looked at Mo Qingyun with a puzzled expression and asked: “Young Master, why do you ask this? Do you have a way to restore my cultivation?”

“That’s right!”

Hearing the Nine Palaces Elder’s words, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and didn’t explain further.

Then he took out the Crimson Flame Cauldron to refine a soul cultivation recovery pill, allowing the Nine Palaces Elder to recover his cultivation first.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun’s idea was that it would be better to have the Nine Palaces Elder recover his cultivation first and then activate a higher-level Time Shift Array.

This way, he could obtain faster cultivation speed in a shorter time.

Of course, Mo Qingyun had this idea because the Nine Palaces Elder’s current cultivation was at a critical point for breakthrough.

With his half-step Heaven Spirit Realm cultivation, he just needed a trigger to enter the Heaven Spirit Realm.

Otherwise, if his cultivation was only at the True Essence Realm, he wouldn’t do this.

It would be too wasteful of time.

“Young Master, what are you doing?”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s actions, the Nine Palaces Elder showed a surprised expression. Was he refining pills?

“Refining a batch of medicinal pills.”

Hearing the Nine Palaces Elder’s question, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and responded.

Then he started refining the medicinal pills. He pointed at the herbs in front of him, and a few stars appeared on his fingers.

Under Mo Qingyun’s point, the herbs leaped into the cauldron like little fish.

Fish Leap Dragon Gate Hand!

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s technique, the Nine Palaces Elder was shocked and looked at him in amazement.

But before the Nine Palaces Elder could recover from his shock, Mo Qingyun’s gesture changed again. He pointed at the cauldron.

Then, the flames in the cauldron transformed into a beast form and swallowed all the herbs, leaping rapidly.

With each leap of the cauldron’s beast flames, the purity of the herbs in its body increased by a level.

Divine Beast Cauldron Hand!

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s technique, the Nine Palaces Elder was stunned.

This scene greatly exceeded his expectations. At Mo Qingyun’s age, he could master refining techniques so proficiently.

Moreover, earlier, Mo Qingyun had shown his exceptional understanding of array formations.

“Could Young Master be a Heaven Soul Clan’s powerful cultivator who has reincarnated, but hasn’t awakened his memories yet?”

At this moment, the Nine Palaces Elder’s gaze towards Mo Qingyun changed significantly, with a hint of reverence.

The resentment in his heart seemed to have faded somewhat at this moment.

If Mo Qingyun was indeed a powerful cultivator of the Heaven Soul Clan who had reincarnated, becoming his Star General wouldn’t be a disgraceful thing.

After that, the Nine Palaces Elder waited quietly by Mo Qingyun’s side and watched him refine pills.

But during the following time, he saw Mo Qingyun display over ten refining techniques one after another.

Each technique was performed with great proficiency, each movement reaching perfection as if it had been refined through countless repetitions.

Seeing this, the Nine Palaces Elder became more certain of his guess.

“Young Master is a powerful cultivator of the Heaven Soul Clan who has reincarnated!”

The Nine Palaces Elder’s expression was solemn as he thought, confirming his previous guess.

About a day later, the aroma of medicinal pills emerged from the cauldron.

The pills were refined successfully.

“It’s done!”

Smelling the aroma of the pills, Mo Qingyun showed a pleased expression and opened the cauldron.

After opening it, he waved his hand to take out the pills from the cauldron.

Then three silver-gray medicinal pills quietly lay in Mo Qingyun’s hand.

“What a rich medicinal power!”

Feeling the medicinal power of the pills, the Nine Palaces Elder’s expression changed and he showed a surprised look.

He was sure that the medicinal pills Mo Qingyun refined were at least Seventh Rank in grade.

However, what shocked him even more was that after inhaling a bit of the medicinal power, his cultivation seemed to have improved slightly.

This meant that Mo Qingyun’s refined pills could enhance his soul power.

Seeing this, the Nine Palaces Elder was shocked in his heart.

He finally understood what Mo Qingyun’s words meant earlier.

Now he realized that when Mo Qingyun asked him how many times speed the Time Shift Array could be activated after reaching Heaven Spirit Realm, he had this plan in mind.

Thinking of this, the Nine Palaces Elder asked: “Young Master, what are these pills?”

“Simplified Reversal Soul Nourishing Pill.”

Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and handed the pills to the Nine Palaces Elder, saying: “Although these pills’ effects are not as good as true Reversal Soul Nourishing Pills, they can still nourish the soul and enhance soul power for those in a residual soul state.”

“Simplified Reversal… Soul Nourishing Pill!”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, the Nine Palaces Elder was shocked and almost couldn’t believe his ears.

Reversal Soul Nourishing Pill is a King Rank medicinal pill, only a Medicine King can refine it.

Although these pills were simplified, their grade was at least Eighth Rank.

Thinking this, the Nine Palaces Elder’s expression became excited and his heart was filled with excitement for a long time.

Regarding the Nine Palaces Elder’s thoughts, Mo Qingyun didn’t pay much attention. He instructed him: “Go and take these pills to recover your soul power, I hope you don’t disappoint me.”

“Yes, Old Servant will not let Young Master down!”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, the Nine Palaces Elder took the pills with an excited expression and went to one side to refine them.

Seeing the Nine Palaces Elder go to recover his soul power, Mo Qingyun no longer hesitated and started cultivating.

Recently, he had made continuous breakthroughs in his cultivation. He needed to re-practice his martial techniques and soul skills.

The Nine Palaces Elder was cultivating nearby, so he couldn’t choose to practice martial techniques with too much movement.

After some consideration, Mo Qingyun decided to first cultivate the Soul Heaven Seal.

In his view, cultivating soul battle seals was relatively quiet.

This way, he wouldn’t disturb the Nine Palaces Elder. After his cultivation breakthrough, he could practice other martial techniques.

Deciding to cultivate the Soul Heaven Seal first, Mo Qingyun no longer hesitated and started cultivating.

Then a bit of his soul power was controlled to condense, slowly forming a battle seal.

After a moment, a soul battle seal was successfully condensed.

Seeing the successful condensation of the Soul Heaven Seal, Mo Qingyun didn’t hesitate and continued to condense more soul battle seals.

Thus, time passed as Mo Qingyun cultivated.

Five days later.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun finally completed the cultivation of the Soul Heaven Seal and reached its peak at his current realm.

After five days of cultivation, the number of soul battle seals he condensed increased from twenty-seven to forty-nine.

Mo Qingyun was quite satisfied with this improvement and smiled faintly: “Since the Nine Palaces Elder is still cultivating, I’ll practice the Fire Dragon Seal next. After he finishes his cultivation, I can continue practicing other martial techniques.”

With this thought in mind, Mo Qingyun started cultivating again and began condensing the Fire Dragon Seal.

A pure essence energy slowly condensed under his control, forming a miniature fire dragon.

“Fire’s Essence, Merge!”

Seeing the Fire Dragon Seal condense successfully, Mo Qingyun tried to merge a bit of fire essence into it.

As the fire essence merged with the Fire Dragon Seal, the miniature dragon’s eyes lit up and its aura became more formidable.

At this moment, the Fire Dragon Seal seemed to have gained intelligence, like a true little fire dragon flying and dancing in mid-air.

“It’s done!”

Seeing the changes in the Fire Dragon Seal, Mo Qingyun showed a pleased expression and felt somewhat excited.

From this scene, he realized that his understanding of the martial technique Fire Dragon Seal had not only reached the essence level but seemed to have surpassed it.

He entered a more profound realm.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun no longer hesitated and continued to condense the Fire Dragon Seal.

This way, another five days passed.

Mo Qingyun’s expression suddenly relaxed as he took a deep breath and said: “Finally, it’s completed.”

In these five days of effort, he not only refined the forty-nine Fire Dragon Seals again and merged fire essence into them but also increased their number to eighty-one.

“Next, I’ll practice Golden Jade True Body, Sun Burning Mountain Splitting Saber, and Fierce Bird Break. But which one should I practice first?”

Mo Qingyun frowned slightly, feeling a bit difficult in choosing.

At this moment, as Mo Qingyun was hesitating, an astonishing aura fluctuation came from the Nine Palaces Elder.

The Nine Palaces Elder’s cultivation was about to break through!

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun’s expression changed and he showed a pleased look as he looked at the Nine Palaces Elder.

“After ten days of accumulation, the Nine Palaces Elder’s cultivation is about to break through.”

Seeing the Nine Palaces Elder’s cultivation breakthrough, Mo Qingyun showed a pleased expression and thought: “This way, I don’t have to hurry to choose which martial technique to practice. We can wait until the Nine Palaces Elder’s cultivation breakthrough.”

Then, Mo Qingyun waited quietly by his side.

Several hours later.

The Nine Palaces Elder’s aura finally reached its peak and then suddenly surged, entering a higher realm.

This indicated that the Nine Palaces Elder had broken through to the Heaven Spirit Realm.

After breaking through, the Nine Palaces Elder didn’t stop immediately but stabilized his cultivation before stopping.

After stopping, the Nine Palaces Elder showed a pleased expression and came to Mo Qingyun, excitedly saying: “Old Servant did not disappoint Young Master’s expectations and successfully recovered to the Heaven Spirit Realm.”

“Mm, good!”

Seeing the Nine Palaces Elder’s cultivation breakthrough, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and said with satisfaction: “Since that’s the case, let’s set up an eight-times speed Time Shift Array.”

“Yes!”

The Nine Palaces Elder responded and started setting up the eight-times speed Time Shift Array. Soon, it was successfully set up.

Seeing the successful setup of the eight-times speed Time Shift Array, Mo Qingyun noticed that the difference between it and the five-times speed one was in the speed of the light streaks on the array curtain.

After a brief glance at the Time Shift Array, Mo Qingyun no longer hesitated and started cultivating.

This time, he chose to practice the Golden Jade True Body martial technique first.

Deciding to cultivate the Golden Jade True Body, Mo Qingyun circulated his essence energy and started tempering his body.

As his physical body was continuously tempered, a golden jade glow slowly appeared on his skin surface.

This golden jade glow emerged and moved with each breath Mo Qingyun took, growing stronger with every movement.

Not only that, but in these movements, Mo Qingyun sensed a latent power within his body being drawn out.

This power seemed to be the pure golden force contained in the Golden Stone Lotus Leaf he had refined earlier. He hadn’t expected it to be drawn out now.
