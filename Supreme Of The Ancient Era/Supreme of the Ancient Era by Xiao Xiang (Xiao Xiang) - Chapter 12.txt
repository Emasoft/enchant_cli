Finally, Mo Qingyun picked out nine second-grade spirit medicines after some selection, spending a total of over 19,000 gold coins.

“Back to square one again.”

Looking at the remaining few hundred gold coins in his乾坤bag, Mo Qingyun sighed once more.

After purchasing the spirit medicines, Mo Qingyun left the Precious Spirit Shop and headed towards the cosmetics shop as mentioned by Mo Ling.

Upon arriving at the cosmetics shop, however, he saw that it was crowded with people, as if they were watching some sort of spectacle.

“Have you two wretched maids made up your minds yet? My patience is limited.”

At this moment, a haughty and cold voice emerged from the crowd: “You think not speaking will do? I’ll give you three breaths to hand it over. If you don’t, we will take it ourselves. Should anything happen to your faces in the process, that would be unfortunate.”

“Song Xiuyun, don’t overstep. This cosmetic was chosen by us first; why should we give it to you?”

Following the previous voice, a furious young girl’s voice echoed from within the crowd.

“It’s Xiaoxiao’s voice!”

Hearing the latter voice, Mo Qingyun frowned and quickly pushed through the crowd towards the interior of the cosmetics shop.

Upon entering, Mo Qingyun’s expression instantly turned cold, his eyes flashing with a fierce light. He saw that Mo Xiao and Mo Ling’s cheeks were each marked by a fresh red handprint.

Mo Xiao and Mo Ling had been struck.

“Sister Mo Ling, Xiaoxiao, what happened?”

Mo Qingyun asked with a cold expression and an angry tone.

“Qingyun, you’re here.”

Seeing Mo Qingyun arrive, both Mo Xiao and Mo Ling displayed a look of grievance, their eyes slightly red.

Then, the two girls recounted what had happened. After listening to them, Mo Qingyun’s expression grew even colder.

“People from the Song family!”

Mo Qingyun’s eyes flashed with a cold light as he stared at Song Xiuyun and the others, saying coldly: “Who was it who struck first? Stand up.”

“Hey! So there’s backup!”

Seeing Mo Qingyun appear, Song Xiuyun said disdainfully: “Boy, they were hit by my people. What are you going to do about it?”

“Mo Qingyun, it’s you!”

Following Song Xiuyun’s words, a girl beside her revealed an expression of surprise and said with some disdain: “Lingyu姐, is this the Mo family’s waste who was bothering you?”

“Mm-hmm!” He Lingyu nodded in agreement.

Hearing Song Xiuyun’s words, Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened as he looked at her and said: “I don’t want to fight women. Since you admit it, slap yourself ten times and kneel down to apologize; I won’t hold this against you.”

After speaking to Song Xiuyun, Mo Qingyun looked at the young man who had struck Mo Xiao and Mo Ling and said: “As for you, break your arms.”

“Make me kneel down to apologize and slap myself ten times?”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Song Xiuyun laughed as if she had heard the funniest joke: “Did I hear that right? You, a waste, dare to threaten me?”

“Mo Qingyun, now I realize how wise my decision was in rejecting your pursuit.”

Following Song Xiuyun’s words, He Lingyu said with disdain: “I don’t know whether to call you a fool or ignorant. Do you know who she is? She’s Zihao’s sister. Your actions are even more foolish.”

“Who are you? Do I know you? Are we close?”

Hearing He Lingyu’s words, Mo Qingyun said with disdain: “Don’t think that because you have two big buns on your head, you can speak freely. I’ll give you a friendly reminder: it’s cold outside; wear more clothes so as not to freeze your buns.”

Mo Qingyun’s words made everyone around him dumbfounded, standing there in shock.

After a brief moment of stupor, the men around him looked at Mo Qingyun with admiration and gave him a thumbs up.

Brother, you’re too strong; to think of such words!

As for the women, they blushed and glared at Mo Qingyun.

“You…!”

Under Mo Qingyun’s words, He Lingyu was filled with rage and anger, unable to speak.

“Song Zhichun, go hit this boy’s mouth until it bleeds.”

Seeing He Lingyu’s anger, Song Xiuyun immediately said to a young man beside her: “Go hit this boy’s mouth until it bleeds.”

“Alright, Xiuyun sister!”

The young man named Song Zhichun responded and walked towards Mo Qingyun with a sneer: “Boy, I hit them. Now let’s see how you’ll break my arms.”

“Mo Qingyun, Song Zhichun is at the seventh level of Body Refinement. I advise you to kneel down and apologize, make Mo Xiao and Mo Ling hand over the cosmetics, then leave.”

He Lingyu said with a cold expression.

“Is Body Refinement seventh level that impressive?”

Mo Qingyun responded indifferently to her words.

“Golden Cloud Wolf Claws”

At the moment Mo Qingyun responded to He Lingyu, Song Zhichun suddenly attacked with a grab towards Mo Qingyun.

With his palm, he unleashed powerful force waves aimed at Mo Qingyun’s chest.

“Sneak attack, despicable!”

Seeing Song Zhichun take advantage of Mo Qingyun’s inattention to launch a sneak attack, someone said disdainfully.

“Hmph! As long as I hit him, who cares about the method.”

Song Zhichun looked at Mo Qingyun and said coldly: “Boy, prepare to die.”

Then, everyone saw Song Zhichun’s claws approach Mo Qingyun’s chest in an instant.

Some of the girls around closed their eyes, unable to bear watching any longer.

However, when everyone was worried about Mo Qingyun, they saw Song Zhichun’s hands stop an inch away from Mo Qingyun’s chest.

Crack, crack!

Then they heard two crisp sounds of bones breaking as Song Zhichun’s arms dropped.

In one move, the seventh-level Body Refinement Song Zhichun had his arms broken!

“No… It’s impossible, how could he become so powerful.”

Seeing this, He Lingyu turned pale with fear.

She never imagined that Mo Qingyun’s strength would suddenly become so formidable.

Ignoring He Lingyu’s fear, Mo Qingyun looked at Song Xiuyun and said coldly: “Are you going to do it yourself or shall I?”

Mo Qingyun took a step towards Song Xiuyun, his aura no longer concealed, revealing the peak seventh-level Body Refinement power.

“Peak seventh-level Body Refinement!”

Feeling Mo Qingyun’s aura, Song Xiuyun and the others were shocked.

Mo Qingyun had reached peak seventh-level Body Refinement, no wonder Song Zhichun was defeated in one move.

“He has grown to this extent.”

Looking at the imposing Mo Qingyun, He Lingyu felt a bit dazed.

Was this still the waste she had always looked down upon?

At his age, Mo Qingyun’s cultivation was already considered that of a genius.

In this moment, He Lingyu felt a hint of regret; perhaps her decision to break off the engagement was wrong.

“No! I didn’t make a mistake. Even if Mo Qingyun is more outstanding now, he still can’t compare to Zihao.”

He Lingyu’s face turned pale as she comforted herself.

“What… What do you want?”

Seeing Mo Qingyun approaching, Song Xiuyun’s face turned pale and her voice trembled: “Don’t come over. My brother has entered the True Qi realm; if you dare to touch me, he won’t let it go.”

“True Qi realm?”

Hearing Song Xiuyun’s words, Mo Qingyun’s expression changed slightly, somewhat surprised.

He hadn’t expected that Song Zihao had entered the True Qi realm after a few months.

But this didn’t change his decision.

Song Xiuyun must pay for her actions.

Following, Mo Qingyun took another step towards Song Xiuyun and said arrogantly: “A mere True Qi realm doesn’t scare me. Since you don’t want to do it yourself, I’ll have to do it for you.”

Song Xiuyun was only at the sixth level of Body Refinement; facing Mo Qingyun’s attack, she could hardly resist.

Crack!

Mo Qingyun slapped Song Xiuyun, leaving a handprint on her face.

“You… You dared to hit me!”

Struck by Mo Qingyun, Song Xiuyun looked aggrieved with tears streaming down her face, unable to believe it was real.

She had never been hit before in her life.

And she didn’t expect Mo Qingyun to dare hit her in front of everyone.

“Those who insult others will be insulted.”

Ignoring Song Xiuyun’s reaction, Mo Qingyun said coldly: “Since you can hit others, you should have thought about being hit yourself.”

Crack, crack, crack…

Following, Mo Qingyun slapped Song Xiuyun nine more times.

This made it ten in total.

Under these ten slaps, Song Xiuyun was completely dazed and almost forgot to resist.

Kneel!

Mo Qingyun ignored Song Xiuyun’s reaction, pressing her shoulder lightly.

Then, under Mo Qingyun’s force, Song Xiuyun knelt in front of Mo Xiao and Mo Ling.

Seeing this, everyone was stunned on the spot.

Mo Qingyun really made Song Xiuyun kneel in front of Mo Xiao and Mo Ling after hitting her.

“Qingyun, he…”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s actions, both Mo Xiao and Mo Ling were filled with emotion, their fists clenched tightly.

At this moment, as Mo Xiao and Mo Ling were filled with emotion, Mo Qingyun came to their side and said: “Sister Ling, Xiaoxiao, let’s go.”

“Alright!”

The two girls nodded and followed Mo Qingyun out of the cosmetics shop.

“Mo Qingyun, you will regret this. Today you hit Xiuyun; next year at the Town Assembly, Zihao will not let it go.”

Seeing Mo Qingyun walking away, He Lingyu said with resentment.

“Don’t worry; at the Town Assembly, even if Zihao doesn’t find me, I will find him and return to him double what he gave me.”

Mo Qingyun responded with determination, his tone cold.

Since rebirth, Mo Qingyun had decided to make He Lingyu and Song Zihao pay for their actions.

After saying this, Mo Qingyun no longer paid attention to He Lingyu and left with Mo Xiao and Mo Ling.

Due to the incident with Song Xiuyun, Mo Xiao and Mo Ling no longer had any interest in continuing their shopping.

Then, the three of them returned to the Mo family.

Upon returning home, they separated; Mo Qingyun went back to his residence alone.

As soon as he returned, Mo Qingyun began practicing cultivation again.

However, instead of continuing to improve his cultivation, he decided to familiarize himself with the martial techniques again.

In recent days, he had been focused on improving his cultivation and had relaxed a bit in the practice of martial techniques.

Then, Mo Qingyun immersed himself in practicing his martial techniques again, repeatedly performing them.

With each practice, his understanding of the martial techniques “Swift Shadow Steps” and “Ninefold Collapse” deepened.

Although the martial technique “Swift Shadow Steps” had not yet reached the realm of essence, it still made significant progress.

As for “Ninefold Collapse,” under Mo Qingyun’s continuous practice, it finally reached perfection.

“Now that ‘Swift Shadow Steps’ and ‘Ninefold Collapse’ have both reached a level above perfection, I can try to practice another martial technique.”

Mo Qingyun thought solemnly, considering which martial technique he should practice next.

After some consideration, Mo Qingyun decided to practice a martial technique called “Fire Dragon Seal.”

“Fire Dragon Seal”: It can condense the internal energy, true qi, and true essence within one’s body into a battle seal, unleashing formidable power. It can also be used for both offense and defense, making it a versatile martial technique.

“Fire Dragon Seal” is also an initial-grade Earth-level martial technique, but it differs from “Ninefold Collapse.”

“Fire Dragon Seal” has three levels: the first level is Body Refinement, the second level is True Qi realm, and the third level is True Essence realm.

At the first level, it mainly involves condensing internal energy into a battle seal. Upon reaching perfection, one can condense nine seals.

At the second level, it requires True Qi realm to practice and involves condensing true qi into a battle seal. Upon reaching perfection, one can condense twenty-seven seals.

As for the third level, it requires True Essence realm to practice and involves condensing true essence into a battle seal. Upon reaching perfection, one can condense eighty-one seals.

Then, Mo Qingyun began practicing without hesitation.

Since he had practiced this “Fire Dragon Seal” before, Mo Qingyun quickly got into it.

The next day passed without incident.

After a day of practice, Mo Qingyun reached the beginner level in “Fire Dragon Seal,” condensing five internal energy seals.

He was very satisfied with this, as his strength had risen to a new level.

However, the time for the clan competition finally arrived.

“Clan Competition, it’s here!”

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun showed a look of eagerness and left his residence towards the training ground.

A short while later, when Mo Qingyun arrived at the training ground, it was already packed with people.

Among them were not only Mo family members but also representatives from other families in the Northern Desert Town, who had come to observe the Mo family’s young generation.

They wanted to understand the strength of the Mo family’s younger members through the clan competition, so that their own young generation could have a better understanding in next year’s Town Assembly.

The elders of the Mo family didn’t mind these other families’ representatives coming to watch.

After all, at this time, some Mo family elders had gone to other families to observe their clan competitions.

Everyone was courteous and no one felt disadvantaged.

The most important thing in the elders’ minds was another thought: when other families’ representatives came to watch their young generation’s clan competition, they could also show off a bit.

Perhaps because of the family’s emphasis on the clan competition, some changes were made to the judging platform.

The current scale of the judging platform was much larger than during the monthly exams.

In the center of the judging platform sat an elderly man in his fifties, with traces of age on his face and deep eyes. He sat there exuding an imposing aura without even speaking.

This elderly man was Mo Hongtian, the head of the Mo family. He had late-stage True Essence realm cultivation and was one of the five top experts in Northern Desert Town.

“Could this be my adoptive grandfather?”

Looking at the elderly man sitting in the center of the judging platform, Mo Qingyun smiled wryly.

“Who would have thought that so many important figures would come to this year’s clan competition, quite unexpected.”

As Mo Qingyun observed the judging platform, a sigh came from beside him.

The speaker was a refined young man in his early twenties with peak ninth-level Body Refinement cultivation.

Seeing Mo Qingyun looking at him, the young man smiled and said: “You’re my cousin Qingyun, right?”

“Huh? You know me?”

Mo Qingyun asked in surprise.

“Hehe, you’re the most prominent person in our Mo family now; how could I not know you?”

The young man smiled at Mo Qingyun’s surprise and continued: “I’m Mo Yi. I hope we can have a chance to spar in the clan competition.”

“I look forward to your guidance, Cousin Mo Yi!” Mo Qingyun said politely.

Mo Yi waved his hand and smiled: “Guidance is too much to say, just a friendly exchange.”

After some polite conversation, Mo Qingyun curiously asked: “You said that many important figures came to the clan competition this time, what’s going on?”

“Didn’t you notice the eagle-eyed old man sitting to the right of our head? He’s Song Xù, the patriarch of the Song family. And to the left is He Qiusheng, the patriarch of the He family…”

Mo Yi introduced them one by one to Mo Qingyun.

After hearing Mo Yi’s introduction, Mo Qingyun’s expression changed slightly, somewhat surprised.

He didn’t expect that the patriarchs of both Song and He families would come to this clan competition.

However, what surprised Mo Qingyun even more was that both He Lingyu and Song Xiuyun were walking towards the judging platform.

Perhaps because of Mo Qingyun’s gaze, He Lingyu and Song Xiuyun soon saw him in the crowd and glared at him.

Seeing their expressions, Song Xù and He Qiusheng also looked towards Mo Qingyun.

“Grandfather, he’s Mo Qingyun!”

Seeing the two elders looking at Mo Qingyun, He Lingyu and Song Xiuyun said unhappily.

“Oh!”

Hearing the girls’ words, Song Xù and He Qiusheng’s eyebrows involuntarily furrowed as they looked thoughtful.

After a moment, He Qiusheng broke the silence and smiled: “Brother Hongtian, is that your grandson Mo Qingyun? Indeed a fine young man.”

“Brother Qiusheng, you flatter me!” Mo Hongtian smiled and responded. He then looked at Mo Qingyun.

If one observed closely, they could see a hint of satisfaction in his eyes.

It seemed that Mo Qingyun’s recent performances had reached him as well.

“Grandfather, you don’t know how strong Mo Qingyun is. He hit Xiuyun because of his high cultivation.”

At this moment, Song Xiuyun beside Song Xù said with a pout.

“Is that so?”

Song Xù and the others’ expressions changed slightly.

Seeing their reactions, Song Xiuyun’s eyes flashed with satisfaction and then recounted the events to them.

After hearing Song Xiuyun’s words, Song Xù’s face darkened and he scolded her: “Xiuyun, don’t exaggerate. If you weren’t so stubborn, Qingyun wouldn’t have hit you.”

Hearing Song Xù’s words, Song Xiuyun looked displeased. Before she could speak, Song Xù turned to Mo Hongtian and said unhappily: “Brother Hongtian, your grandson is quite formidable. He hit someone over a disagreement.”

“Brother Xù, don’t be angry. My grandson is mischievous; I’ll discipline him later.” Mo Hongtian said seriously.

“Haha, Brother Xù and Brother Hongtian, let the young generation handle their own affairs. We should focus on watching the clan competition.”

Seeing the awkward atmosphere, He Qiusheng broke it and said.

Then, Mo Hongtian and the others looked towards the competition area without saying more.

In the competition area,

Seeing that all the young generation had arrived, an elder from Mo family walked out and said: “Now I’ll announce the rules of the clan competition.”

In the first round, there will be ten battlefields for mixed combat. Each battlefield has fifty people, and the top five from each will advance.

In the second round, there will be a draw to match opponents. The winners will advance, and the losers will compete for rankings.

“Now I’ll call out names. Those called should enter the first battlefield.”

The elder in the center of the competition area announced, then began calling out names.

Soon, all participants were called and evenly distributed among the ten battlefields.

Perhaps due to special arrangements, several young people with ninth-level Body Refinement cultivation or higher were distributed in different battlefields.

This was likely to prevent them from facing each other too early and possibly eliminating promising young talents in the first round.

Quickly scanning around, Mo Qingyun noticed that Mo Cang was assigned to the first battlefield and Mo Xin, with higher cultivation, was in the second.

“Mo Cang is assigned to the first battlefield; are they setting him up?”

Seeing Mo Cang’s assignment, Mo Qingyun smiled slyly.

Then he observed further and found that the young man who had talked to him, Mo Yi, was assigned to the seventh battlefield.

Moreover, each battlefield seemed to have around thirty participants.

With five advancing from thirty, the elimination rate was quite high. Advancing to the next round seemed not so easy.

“In my group, there doesn’t seem to be anyone with ninth-level Body Refinement cultivation.”

After a quick glance at his opponents, Mo Qingyun noticed that his group seemed to be the weakest among all ten groups.

He was quite pleased with this situation, as it would make his advancement easier without needing to reveal too many cards.

The competition began. The young people in the battlefields quickly formed several groups.

Four with eighth-level Body Refinement cultivation each formed a group, and the rest of those with seventh-level or lower formed another.

Mo Qingyun didn’t find this surprising. After all, forming groups reduced the chances of being eliminated.

Soon, nine groups were formed in the competition area. They eyed each other warily without anyone taking the initiative to attack.

However, they soon noticed that Mo Qingyun’s group was the weakest in appearance. Although he had peak seventh-level Body Refinement cultivation, being alone made him seem weaker.

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s group as the weakest, others started eyeing him as a target. After all, with only one person and not the highest cultivation, he was easier to deal with.

But no one took action immediately. After all, eliminating him would still consume some energy.

So everyone waited for someone to act first.

After a few minutes, one person grew impatient. It was an eighth-level Body Refinement cultivator.

He looked around and said arrogantly to those with seventh-level or lower cultivation: “You have ten breaths to fight among yourselves and decide who advances. If you don’t, we four will clear the field.”

He glanced at the other three eighth-level Body Refinement cultivators, signaling them.

The others agreed and responded accordingly.

Seeing the four eighth-level Body Refinement cultivators reach an agreement, the others looked tense and unsure.

If they fought among themselves, only one would advance. But if they didn’t fight, facing the four eighth-level Body Refinement cultivators would be hopeless.

With this thought in mind, the atmosphere grew tense. But no one acted.

Ten breaths passed without anyone moving.

Seeing this, the eighth-level Body Refinement cultivator said coldly: “Since you don’t want to fight, we’ll clear the field.”

Then everyone saw four eighth-level Body Refinement cultivators stand up and prepare to attack.

The other groups quickly formed a united front, thinking that this would give them some chance against the four eighth-level Body Refinement cultivators.

Mo Qingyun remained alone, making his group seem even weaker.

Seeing this, the eighth-level Body Refinement cultivator said coldly to Mo Qingyun: “Boy, you’re first. Leave the battlefield now and I won’t make it hard for you.”

“Leave the battlefield?”

Hearing this, Mo Qingyun’s expression changed slightly. He looked at him with a playful gaze.

It seemed that this guy saw him as an easy target and wanted to start with him.

“Do you have any objections? Or do I need to make a move?”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s questioning look, the eighth-level Body Refinement cultivator named Mo Chuan said unhappily. He stretched his arms and walked towards Mo Qingyun.

“Try it then?”

Mo Qingyun responded indifferently to his threat.

“Mo Chuan, this boy doesn’t take you seriously.”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s reaction, another eighth-level Body Refinement cultivator beside him said with a smile.

Hearing this, Mo Chuan’s face darkened and he looked at Mo Qingyun again: “Boy, I’m warning you. Be sensible and don’t force me to act; otherwise, I can’t guarantee that you’ll walk away.”

“I warn you too. Leave now or I can’t guarantee that you’ll walk away.”

Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened and he said coldly.

“Wow, this boy is so arrogant; he dares to talk back to Mo Chuan.”

“Hehe, Mo Chuan, this boy doesn’t take you seriously at all.”

“Not only does he not take you seriously; he treats you like nothing.”

“Mo Chuan, if you don’t act now, you’re just a coward.”

…

The other eighth-level Body Refinement cultivators mocked Mo Chuan.

Seeing this, Mo Chuan’s face darkened and he said with a twisted expression: “Boy, you’re forcing me.”

“Star Flying Hand”

Mo Chuan said and reached out to grab Mo Qingyun’s throat, intending to throw him out of the battlefield.

Seeing this, everyone around looked at Mo Qingyun with a mix of envy and anticipation. If Mo Qingyun was thrown out, they would have one less competitor.

After all, despite being a peak seventh-level Body Refinement cultivator, Mo Qingyun was formidable in one-on-one combat. It would be quite troublesome for them to deal with him without Mo Chuan’s intervention.

But now, Mo Qingyun was about to be eliminated by Mo Chuan. That would be the best outcome for them.

However, as everyone waited to see Mo Qingyun thrown out of the battlefield,

Boom!

A muffled sound echoed, and everyone saw Mo Chuan fly out of the battlefield.

Mo Chuan was hit!

Seeing this, everyone in the battlefield was stunned.

This outcome was quite different from what they had imagined. They couldn’t believe how powerful Mo Qingyun was.

An eighth-level Body Refinement cultivator like Mo Chuan was thrown out of the battlefield in one move by Mo Qingyun.

“You…!”

Seeing himself thrown out of the battlefield by Mo Qingyun in one move, Mo Chuan felt disgusted.

He never expected that he would be the first to be eliminated despite his eighth-level Body Refinement cultivation.

“I used a bit too much force; I didn’t want to eliminate you.”

Mo Qingyun said with a smile as he looked at the eliminated Mo Chuan.

Mo Chuan felt even more depressed. What did “a bit too much force” mean? He thought Mo Qingyun was deliberately doing it.

Otherwise, how could he have been thrown to the edge of the battlefield and eliminated so conveniently?

Ignoring Mo Chuan’s resentful gaze, Mo Qingyun turned his attention back to the battlefield and said calmly: “Who else wants me to leave?”

Hearing this, everyone involuntarily took a step back and looked at Mo Qingyun with awe.

How could they challenge Mo Qingyun after seeing him throw an eighth-level Body Refinement cultivator out of the battlefield with one punch?

Seeing no one willing to step forward, Mo Qingyun sat down leisurely and looked at everyone with a smile: “You have five minutes to decide four advancing spots. Otherwise, I’ll throw all of you out.”

“Ahhh!”

Hearing this, everyone looked at Mo Qingyun with awe and drew a breath. They thought: “This guy is too ruthless; he wants to eliminate all of us.”

But despite their dissatisfaction, no one dared to argue with Mo Qingyun.

Then everyone in the battlefield acted without hesitation.

But as they fought, they felt bitter. Was this karma?

They had treated Mo Qingyun like that just moments ago; now the situation was reversed.

“Father! Patriarch Song, Patriarch He, Elders!”
