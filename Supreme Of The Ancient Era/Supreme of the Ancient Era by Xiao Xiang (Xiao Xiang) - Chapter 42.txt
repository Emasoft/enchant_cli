Mo Qingyun’s elixirs were successfully refined!

And at this moment, the concentration of the medicinal aroma was even stronger and purer than that of Xue Xiao’s earlier.

Amidst everyone's shock, a crimson-blue colored medicinal pill fell into Mo Qingyun’s hands.

"Two-Pole Breakthrough Pill, after consuming it, one can increase the chances of breaking through to the Dan Mansion Realm by thirty percent."

Mo Qingyun held the crimson-blue medicinal pill in his hand and introduced it to everyone, handing it over to one of the judges beside him: "Please check the grade of this medicinal pill."

"Good... good!"

Upon hearing Mo Qingyun’s introduction, the judge trembled in his heart and nervously accepted the medicinal pill.

The way that judge handled it carefully, as if he were holding a delicate tofu rather than a medicinal pill, was evident in his every move.

"Such powerful medicinal power, just by absorbing a little bit to enhance it, I feel my essence energy has increased slightly."

"This kind of medicinal pill, I can no longer determine its exact grade, but I can be sure it is at least a Sixth Rank."

"This medicinal pill contains the power of ice and fire, with a trace of water and fire energy fluctuations; it should be the Two-Pole Breakthrough Pill."

"If this is true, then the grade of this medicinal pill should be at least a Sixth Rank middle."

...

The judges examined the medicinal pill in their hands and expressed various opinions.

In the end, Mo Qingyun’s Two-Pole Breakthrough Pill was rated as Sixth Rank middle.

Even so, Mo Qingyun had already secured a victory over Xue Xiao.

Sixth Rank middle!

As soon as the grade of the medicinal pill was announced, everyone froze, their eyes wide with astonishment as they looked at Mo Qingyun.

Mo Qingyun had actually refined a Sixth Rank middle medicinal pill, which meant he was already a Sixth Rank middle alchemist.

A Sixth Rank alchemist! Even among all the alchemists in Xia Kingdom, he was considered a top-tier existence.

Everyone had never imagined that Mo Qingyun’s alchemy skills would reach such heights in a short period of time.

"Six... Sixth Rank middle, this kid’s alchemy skills have reached such a level."

Du Luo and the others were all stunned, their eyes wide with disbelief at Mo Qingyun’s medicinal pill grade.

They never would have thought that Mo Qingyun’s alchemy skills had reached such a degree.

"Good, good, good!"

At this moment, Mo Hongtian was almost shedding tears of joy, his face filled with relief. Apart from praising him, he didn’t know how to express his feelings.

"This kid always surprises us."

Mo Feipeng, standing beside him, smiled broadly and said with a laugh: "But hearing this news really makes one feel exhilarated. A Sixth Rank alchemist, so domineering."

"Whew!"

Wan Lianyun also sucked in a breath of air, looking at Mo Qingyun with shock and thinking: "How many secrets does this young master have hidden within him."

At this moment, Mo Qingyun felt increasingly enigmatic.

As everyone was shocked by the grade of the Two-Pole Breakthrough Pill, Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened as he looked at Xue Xiao and coldly said: "Xue Xiao, prepare to die!"

...

"Impossible!"

Upon hearing Mo Qingyun’s medicinal pill grade, Xue Xiao immediately showed a demented look and couldn’t accept the result. He raved: "You... you can't refine a Sixth Rank medicinal pill, you can’t win me!"

"It must be that you bribed them to help you cheat."

Xue Xiao pointed at the judges with a cold look and said: "Yes, it must be that you bribed these guys to cheat together."

"Cheat?"

Hearing Xue Xiao’s words, Mo Qingyun glanced at him with disdain and said: "You think too highly of yourself. To win you, it doesn’t need to be so complicated."

After uttering a disdainful remark, Mo Qingyun rarely engaged in idle talk with Xue Xiao and directly instructed Chilin: "Chilin, send him on his way!"

"Yes, Young Master!"

Upon hearing Mo Qingyun’s instructions, Chilin smiled coldly and said to Xue Xiao: "Boy, it's no use talking more. Let this old man send you on your way."

Chilin spoke and raised his hand to strike Xue Xiao.

At this moment, a figure appeared in front of Xue Xiao and blocked Chilin’s palm.

"Too arrogant, you can’t just move against our Xue family."

Seeing the person in front of him, Xue Xiao grabbed at this straw for survival and immediately said with a panicked look: "Ancestor, Ancestor save me!"

Ancestor!

Hearing Xue Xiao’s words at this moment, everyone was surprised by the identity of the person in front.

Indeed, the one who blocked Chilin’s attack was Xue Haotian.

After blocking Chilin’s strike, Xue Haotian looked at Xue Xiao with a look of disappointment.

Xue Xiao’s performance was truly disappointing, fully revealing his unstable state of mind.

Although he felt disappointed with Xue Xiao’s performance, Xue Haotian wouldn’t watch helplessly as Xue Xiao was easily killed by others.

"Xue Haotian, it’s you!"

Amidst everyone’s shock at Xue Haotian’s identity, Wan Lianyun said with surprise and a cold tone: "You’re still alive?"

"Alive?"

Xue Haotian replied with a mocking smile: "Wan Lianyun, you’re still alive, so how could I be dead?"

"Such an old ghost!"

Seeing Xue Haotian in front of him, Du Luo was also surprised and said with a deep voice: "Xue Haotian, Xue Xiao’s bet with Qingyun was witnessed by everyone. Are you going to break the agreement in front of everyone?"

"Break the agreement?"

Hearing Du Luo’s words, Xue Haotian said with a cold smile: "Du Luo, you’re getting dumber as you age. Bets are always used to control the weak; now that we have an absolute advantage, even if we break our word, what can you do to us?"

"You..."

Hearing Xue Haotian’s words, Du Luo was speechless with anger.

Seeing Du Luo’s agitation, Xue Haotian smiled coldly and looked at Wan Lianyun: "Wan Lianyun, it’s time to settle some old scores. From now on, the owner of Lianyun City will be changed."

...

After Xue Haotian’s words, he turned to Du Luo and the others: "Originally, we planned to move against you after Xiao’s son became the president of the Alchemist Alliance Guild and completely controlled it, but unexpectedly this kid ruined our plan. However, now these things don’t matter anymore; even if Xiao’s son hasn’t controlled the Alchemist Alliance Guild, it’s enough to get rid of you."

Hearing Xue Haotian’s words, Du Luo and the others were filled with a sense of fear.

They knew clearly that if Xue Xiao controlled the Alchemist Alliance Guild, the consequences would be unimaginable.

Imagine three of the four major forces in Lianyun City being controlled by them; it would be hard for the city’s sky not to change.

At this moment, as Du Luo and the others were shocked, Xue Haotian released his half-step Dan Mansion Realm aura without reservation.

Half-step Dan Mansion Realm!

As soon as Xue Haotian’s aura was released, everyone’s expressions changed and a sense of shock arose in their hearts.

Xue Haotian’s cultivation had reached the half-step Dan Mansion Realm.

A half-step Dan Mansion Realm powerhouse was considered a king-like existence in Lianyun City.

Thinking of this, some people around them unconsciously showed a look of sympathy and looked at Mo Qingyun and the others.

It was a bad thing for them to offend such an existence.

However, before everyone could recover from their shock, Yuan Sheng beside Xue Haotian also released his aura, showcasing the power of a half-step Dan Mansion Realm powerhouse.

Another half-step Dan Mansion Realm powerhouse!

"Whew!"

Seeing this, everyone around sucked in a breath of air and the awe on their faces deepened.

There were two half-step Dan Mansion Realm powerhouses hidden in Taishan Sect and Tianlong Gang, which was truly terrifying.

"It seems that Lianyun City is really going to change. Who would have thought that Taishan Sect and Tianlong Gang were hiding so deeply."

"Sigh! That young master Dan is really unfortunate. With his talent, if he hadn’t died today, he would have achieved extraordinary accomplishments in the future."

"Yes! At his age being a Sixth Rank alchemist, if there are no unexpected events, he will become a Dan King level figure in the future."

"Envious of talent, how many geniuses have fallen like this throughout history."

...

At this moment, everyone looked at Mo Qingyun with regret.

"Two half-step Dan Mansion!"

Feeling the aura of Xue Haotian and Yuan Sheng, even Wan Lianyun’s expression became solemn.

The presence of a Dan Mansion Realm powerhouse was enough to instantly change the situation, putting Mo Qingyun and the others in a desperate situation.

Originally, both sides were evenly matched, but now that the other side had an additional half-step Dan Mansion Realm powerhouse, this balance was broken.

Seeing this, Xue Xiao immediately showed a smug smile and said to Mo Qingyun with a cold laugh: "Boy, even if your alchemy skills are higher than mine, today you will still die here."

"Is that so?"

Looking at Xue Xiao’s smug look, Mo Qingyun curled his lips and said with a playful smile: "Xue Xiao, you’re too early to be happy. Just two half-step Dan Mansion Realm powerhouses; even if a true Dan Mansion Realm powerhouse comes today, you will still die. Today no one can protect you."

"Young man, your words are quite big."

...

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Yuan Sheng’s expression darkened and he said coldly to him: "Since you’re so arrogant, this old man will kill you first."

Seeing Yuan Sheng speak up, Mo Qingyun narrowed his eyes and looked at him coldly: "Old dog, the first to be shot is the one who sticks his head out. Since you want to stick your head out, I’ll kill you first."

"Chilin, deal with this old dog!"

After instructing Chilin, Mo Qingyun turned to look at the people from Taishan Sect and Tianlong Gang and said calmly: "You all can join in too!"

...

Under Mo Qingyun’s words, the elders who had been turned into blood slaves by Taishan Sect and Tianlong Gang immediately attacked those beside them.

Facing the sudden attack of these blood slaves, the remaining elders were caught off guard.

Bang bang bang...

In a short moment, under these blood slaves’ attacks, nearly half of the remaining elders were disabled.

What’s going on?

Seeing this, everyone was dumbfounded and filled with confusion.

Why were the elders of Taishan Sect and Tianlong Gang attacking their own people?

"You... you..."

Seeing the blood slaves turn against them, Xue Haotian and the others were furious, their expressions twitching as they asked: "What are you doing? Are you crazy?"

They also didn’t understand why these elders suddenly attacked their own people like madmen.

But the blood slaves paid no heed to their questions and quickly rushed towards Mo Qingyun.

"Reporting to Young Master!"

These blood slaves came before Mo Qingyun and knelt half-way, bowing to him.

Young Master!

The elders of Tianlong Gang and Taishan Sect called Mo Qingyun their master!

Seeing this, everyone was shocked again, unable to believe what they saw.

Mo Qingyun had quietly subdued these elders of Taishan Sect and Tianlong Gang.

It was too crazy, this was really too crazy.

If they hadn’t seen it with their own eyes, even if you beat them to death, they wouldn’t have believed it.

What kind of means were these?

At this moment, everyone didn’t know what to say. Was this something a True Essence Realm cultivator should possess?

"Dan... Young Master Dan has subdued more than half of the elders from Tianlong Gang and Taishan Sect, what a powerful means."

"We all underestimated Young Master Dan. This kind of thing isn’t something ordinary people can do."

"From now on, the situation seems hard to predict. It might be difficult for Taishan Sect and Tianlong Gang to eliminate Young Master Dan and the others."

...

Seeing this, everyone around couldn’t help but sigh.

"Good, good, good boy!"

Seeing this, Mo Hongtian and the others laughed with joy, their hearts filled with excitement. Their expressions relaxed a bit.

Mo Qingyun’s performance was truly beyond everyone’s expectations.

The originally certain defeat had been turned around by Mo Qingyun, regaining some chances of victory at least with the ability to resist.

"How many things has this boy kept from us, quietly gathering such a group of subordinates."

Mo Feipeng was excited and clenched his fists tightly, exclaiming: "Such ability seems to surpass even my Flying Yu from back then."

"I underestimated Young Master Mo,"

Seeing more than half of the elders of Taishan Sect and Tianlong Gang subdued by Mo Qingyun, Wan Lianyun smiled bitterly and shook his head: "It turns out that the few people I saw in Xue family were just a small part of Young Master Mo’s subordinates. This Young Master Mo is really making me more and more enigmatic."

Of course, while being shocked, Wan Lianyun was also pleasantly surprised.

In his view, with the help of these blood slaves, they would have some resistance power from now on.

"Haha!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s move, Du Luo and the others laughed loudly: "Good, good boy, well done."

"Xue Haotian, you wanted to sideline us through Xue Xiao,"

Zhao Qi smiled broadly and said: "But you probably didn’t think that your Tianlong Gang and Taishan Sect would be sidelined by my disciple."

Seeing Mo Qingyun retaliate with the same means, Du Luo and the others felt extremely satisfied.

Compared to Du Luo’s satisfaction, Xue Haotian and the others were filled with anger.

"Another you, this stinky kid!"

Xue Haotian’s expression twitched and he looked at Mo Qingyun with a fierce look.

He couldn’t bear the fact that this True Essence Realm young man kept disrupting his plans again and again.

"Stinky kid, you’ve disrupted my plan three times. I’ll kill you."

Xue Haotian’s expression darkened and he moved, raising his hand to attack Mo Qingyun.

"Xue Haotian, your opponent is me."

Seeing Xue Haotian move, Wan Lianyun smiled coldly and moved towards him: "What you said is right. It’s time to settle some old scores."

After Wan Lianyun spoke, he immediately fought with Xue Haotian. Instantly, essence energy raged and principles spread.

Under their battle’s aftermath, some buildings of the Alchemist Alliance Guild were instantly affected and destroyed into dust.

As for those watching around, seeing this, they quickly retreated.

The peak battle of the four major forces in Lianyun City wasn’t something these minor forces could participate in. To avoid being affected, it was better to retreat.

After Wan Lianyun and Xue Haotian started fighting, others also entered the battle, each finding opponents of similar strength and engaging in combat.

Du Luo and the others fought with Tai Zhenhai, Long Zhenjiang, and the rest. For a while, both sides were evenly matched.

But everyone knew clearly that this balance was mainly because Yuan Sheng, the half-step Dan Mansion Realm powerhouse, hadn’t moved yet.

If Yuan Sheng moved, this balance would be broken soon.

"Your group will definitely lose in this battle!"

Xue Haotian smiled coldly and said to Wan Lianyun after surveying the situation: "Wan Lianyun, some old scores need to be settled. Yuan Sheng, please deal with that boy from Mo family."

"Rest assured, Mr. Xue,"

Yuan Sheng smiled coldly and looked at Mo Qingyun: "Boy, no one can save you now. Prepare to die."

Yuan Sheng’s aura was like a dark wind and killing energy.

As soon as Yuan Sheng moved, his palm burst with powerful essence energy, forming a dark aura that swept towards Mo Qingyun.

Under this killing aura, the air seemed to become illusory as if corroded by it.

Blood mist spread

Seeing Yuan Sheng move, Chilin didn’t hesitate and moved towards him.

Under Chilin’s action, a blood mist instantly emerged around his body, clashing with the dark wind Yuan Sheng had unleashed.

However, unexpectedly, when the dark wind met Chilin’s blood mist, it showed a weaker state.

Seeing this, Yuan Sheng’s expression changed and he exclaimed: "Blood power, you can actually invoke blood power."

When Yuan Sheng said this, his tone was filled with envy.

Power force, this is the prerequisite for breaking through to Dan Mansion Realm.

The reason his cultivation was still at half-step Dan Mansion Realm was that he couldn’t invoke the power force in the principles.

"Power force!"

Hearing Yuan Sheng’s words, Wan Lianyun and Xue Haotian also changed their expressions.

They didn’t expect that the old man with red hair beside Mo Qingyun, who was only at Essence Core Realm Ninth Stage, could actually invoke power force.

Apart from surprise, some people who knew Chilin were filled with confusion and shock.

They clearly remembered that when they first met Chilin, his cultivation seemed to be only at Essence Core Realm First Stage.

However, in just a few months, Chilin’s cultivation had reached Essence Core Realm Ninth Stage and he had even comprehended power force.

If Chilin hadn’t deliberately concealed his cultivation before, then Chilin’s cultivation speed was too terrifying.

In just a few months, from Essence Core Realm First Stage to Ninth Stage.

What kind of cultivation speed was this, no one could achieve it anymore.

Who is this red-haired old man?

Why has his cultivation improved so quickly?

...

At this moment, countless questions and confusions appeared in Wan Lianyun’s mind.

Thinking of this, they suddenly realized that Mo Qingyun and Chilin had many similarities.

Not only did their cultivation speeds exceed expectations, but also their comprehension of realms was outstanding.

After this discovery, Mo Qingyun and Chilin’s impressions in everyone’s minds became even more mysterious.

Mighty Sky Dragon Slash

At this moment, as everyone was shocked by Chilin’s means, Mo Qingyun moved and quickly retreated from the battle between Chilin and Yuan Sheng.

Without using Dan Mansion Realm power, Chilin’s battle wasn’t something he could approach.

After retreating from the battle between Chilin and Yuan Sheng, Mo Qingyun surveyed the entire battlefield. Seeing that his side was in an advantageous position, he relaxed a bit.

"Xue Xiao!"

At this moment, as Mo Qingyun surveyed the entire battlefield, a familiar figure entered his eyes.

Mighty Sky Dragon Slash

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun showed a playful smile and approached Xue Xiao.

"Mo Qingyun!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun approach quickly, Xue Xiao’s expression twitched and a look of panic appeared.

Seeing Xue Xiao’s panicked look, Mo Qingyun narrowed his eyes and said with a cold light: "I told you that even if two half-step Dan Mansion Realm powerhouses are here, today you will still die."

...

Furnace Sun Mountain-Splitting Saber

Mo Qingyun spoke and took out the Fire Silk Saber, slashing towards Xue Xiao powerfully.

As his hand moved and the saber fell, a red glow burst from the Fire Silk Saber, forming a True Essence energy blade over twenty meters long.

"Young man, dare you!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s actions, a Taishan Sect Essence Core Realm First Stage elder beside him immediately darkened his expression and shouted at Mo Qingyun.

After saying this, he crazily attacked, forcing the opponent back and rushing towards Mo Qingyun.

Thousand Mountain Tyrant Leg

Under this Taishan Sect elder’s action, he leaped up and kicked towards Mo Qingyun.

After his leg moved, a shocking essence energy fluctuation burst from it, forming an enormous leg shadow that descended like a mountain pressing down on Mo Qingyun.

"Humph! Since you’re looking for death, I’ll kill you first!"

Seeing this Taishan Sect elder’s actions, Mo Qingyun darkened his expression and turned the Fire Silk Saber towards him.

Seal Door, Unseal!

Under Mo Qingyun’s move, he unsealed the seal on his Dan Mansion Realm power and enhanced his cultivation.

Then, Mo Qingyun’s aura rapidly increased, reaching the level of Essence Core Realm Second Stage in an instant.

Now that his Golden Jade True Body was perfected, he could use the power from his Dan Mansion Realm to become even stronger.

Essence Core Realm Second Stage aura!

...

Feeling Mo Qingyun’s aura, Xue Xiao’s expression changed dramatically and his face turned pale.

Not only that, the Taishan Sect elder who attacked Mo Qingyun also changed his expression after seeing this.

This time he seemed to have been overconfident.

Slash!

Under the elder’s change of expression, a terrifying blade light burst from the Fire Silk Saber and slashed into the essence energy leg shadow.

Puchi!

Under the fire blade light’s attack, the essence energy leg shadow was instantly incinerated and dissipated in mid-air.

However, after destroying the leg shadow, the Fire Silk Saber’s attack didn’t diminish; it continued to slash towards the elder and instantly hit him.

"No..."

Being slashed by the Fire Silk Saber, this Taishan Sect elder’s expression was filled with fear and he uttered a word of despair.

Shi!

The saber fell, blood splattered; this Taishan Sect Essence Core Realm First Stage elder died.

"No... impossible!"

Seeing this, Xue Xiao’s expression was filled with fear and he said in panic: "This... this must be an illusion, you... you can’t kill Elder Xue Wan."

He couldn’t believe that a Taishan Sect elder at Essence Core Realm, after just one confrontation with Mo Qingyun, was powerfully killed.

"It’s your turn now."

Facing Xue Xiao’s panic, Mo Qingyun didn’t show any mercy and slashed towards him with the saber.

Puchi!

With his current Essence Core Realm Second Stage cultivation, Xue Xiao couldn’t even react to Mo Qingyun’s saber and was directly slashed.

"No, don’t kill me..."

Seeing the rapidly approaching Fire Silk Saber, Xue Xiao’s eyes widened in panic and he said with a look of fear and despair: "I don’t want to die, I’m the genius of Xue family, a genial alchemist, I..."

Shi!

Before Xue Xiao could finish his words, he was forever silent, incinerated into ashes by the flames.

"Xiao!"

Seeing Xue Xiao die, Xue Haotian and the others beside him were filled with rage and roared madly.

Xue Xiao was the best-talented young generation member of Xue family, the successor and hope for Xue family’s rise.

With Mo Qingyun killing him now, it was like cutting off the hope of Xue family. How could they not go mad?

"Young man, I’ll kill you!"

At this moment, the elders of Taishan Sect and Tianlong Gang all had bloodshot eyes and crazily rushed towards Mo Qingyun.

Seeing their actions, Mo Qingyun’s expression turned solemn and he no longer held back. He unsealed the seal on his Dan Mansion Realm power again.

Seal Door, Unseal!

As Mo Qingyun unsealed the seal on his Dan Mansion Realm power again, a shocking force was mobilized.

Then, Mo Qingyun’s aura rapidly increased once more.

After a moment, until blood dripped from his pores, he stopped mobilizing the power.

This indicated that Mo Qingyun’s body had reached its limit in bearing Dan Mansion Realm power.

Essence Core Realm Ninth Stage!

At this moment, Mo Qingyun’s aura had reached the level of Essence Core Realm Ninth Stage.

Feeling Mo Qingyun’s aura, everyone was shocked and their hearts trembled.

They never expected that Mo Qingyun had sealed such a powerful force within his body.

"Whew! Young Master Dan’s cultivation has reached Essence Core Realm Ninth Stage."

"How is this possible, at his age how could he have such powerful cultivation?"

"That’s not his own cultivation but an external force sealed within him."

"Even so, this is too terrifying. An external force at Essence Core Realm Ninth Stage, it’s really crazy."

"Yes, just borrowing the power of Essence Core Realm Ninth Stage with his own True Essence Realm cultivation, is this still a normal person?"

"What surprises me even more is how he can bear such power."

...

At this moment, everyone around felt a chill in their hearts and looked at Mo Qingyun with awe.

The means Mo Qingyun displayed now had exceeded everyone’s understanding.

"Such terrifying power, how can there be such a powerful force within this young man."

Feeling Mo Qingyun’s aura, the people from Taishan Sect and Tianlong Gang had extremely difficult expressions.

They stopped their attacks on Mo Qingyun and looked at him with awe.

From the current situation, only Yuan Sheng and Xue Haotian could suppress Mo Qingyun.

"Indeed, I overlooked some things."

Feeling Mo Qingyun’s aura, Wan Lianyun smiled bitterly. Mo Qingyun’s performance once again exceeded his expectations.

Essence Core Realm Ninth Stage!

How did this young man, Qingyun, achieve it?

Compared to others’ shock, the Mo family’s people had the strongest feelings.

Because they were most familiar with everything about Mo Qingyun.

But precisely because of this, when they saw Mo Qingyun display Essence Core Realm Ninth Stage cultivation, they were even more shocked.

"Blessing upon our Mo family!"

Mo Hongtian and Mo Kuixin were shedding tears of joy, their hearts filled with excitement, unable to calm down for a long time.

"This young man seems to have far surpassed us."

Mo Feipeng and Mo Yueyu showed a look of satisfaction, their hearts filled with joy. They sighed: "Little Monkey has finally grown up."

As everyone was shocked, Mo Qingyun looked at the people from Taishan Sect and Tianlong Gang with a proud look, his spirit soaring: "If you want to kill me, you’re not qualified!"

After saying this, Mo Qingyun no longer held back and released all three principles towards the people from Taishan Sect and Tianlong Gang.

Furnace Sun Mountain-Splitting Saber

Mo Qingyun held the Fire Silk Saber and directly slashed at a Taishan Sect Essence Core Realm Third Stage elder.

Puchi!

Under the huge cultivation difference, this Essence Core Realm Third Stage elder was instantly killed by Mo Qingyun like a dog.

"The next is you!"

After killing this elder, Mo Qingyun didn’t slow down and slashed at another Essence Core Realm Fourth Stage elder.

The result was the same; facing Mo Qingyun’s attack, this Essence Core Realm Fourth Stage elder also had no resistance and followed the previous one into death.

Seeing Mo Qingyun continuously killing their elders, Xue Haotian showed a fierce look and rushed towards Mo Qingyun: "Young man, I’ll tear you to pieces!"

"Xue Haotian, your opponent is me."

Seeing Xue Haotian’s crazy look, Wan Lianyun smiled coldly and moved again to intercept Xue Haotian.

"Xue Haotian, you’re overstepping!"

Seeing himself intercepted again by Wan Lianyun, Xue Haotian gritted his teeth and was filled with anger.

"Xue Sir, deal with that person. That young man I’ll take care of."

Seeing Xue Haotian’s actions intercepted by Wan Lianyun, Yuan Sheng said with a dark expression and pushed Chilin back with one palm. He then rushed towards Mo Qingyun: "Young man, you’re too proud. Let this old man send you to hell."

After Yuan Sheng spoke, his aura instantly increased, much stronger than when he fought with Chilin.

Yuan Sheng had hidden his strength just now!

Seeing this, everyone’s expressions changed and their faces became tense.

If that was the case, with Yuan Sheng’s cultivation to deal with Mo Qingyun, Mo Qingyun might be in danger.

Chilin sensed the change in Yuan Sheng’s aura and his expression changed, reminding Mo Qingyun: "Young Master, be careful. His cultivation has reached the realm of True Dan Mansion."

However, amidst Chilin and others’ worries, Mo Qingyun remained calm and looked at Yuan Sheng: "Old dog, since you want to die, I’ll fulfill your wish and kill you first!"
