The ten or so elders of Mount Tai Sect and Heavenly Dragon Gang, all at the Nascent Soul realm, were forcefully killed by Wan Lianyun.

Seeing this scene, even Wan Lianyun’s heart could not help but tremble.

How crazy!

In just a day, the backbone strength of Mount Tai Sect and Heavenly Dragon Gang was completely dismantled by Mo Qingyun.

At this moment, Wan Lianyun truly understood what Mo Qingyun meant when he said to drain the pond under Mount Tai Sect and Heavenly Dragon Gang.

“Looks like I underestimated Mo Young Master!”

At this moment, Wan Lianyun could not help but sigh in his heart. The look he gave Mo Qingyun changed slightly, with a hint of awe.

In his view, if Mo Qingyun and his companion wanted to treat the City Lord’s Mansion like this, he would probably be unable to guard against it.

What made Wan Lianyun feel fortunate was that his relationship with Mo Qingyun was not like the one between Mount Tai Sect, Heavenly Dragon Gang, and Mo Qingyun.

At this moment, in Wan Lianyun’s eyes, Mo Qingyun and Chi Lian were becoming increasingly mysterious.

At this moment, when Mo Qingyun was about to order Chi Lian to command the blood slaves to come over again, Chi Lian frowned and came in front of him. He said solemnly, “Young Master, our plan has been exposed; we can’t continue.”

“Hm!”

When Chi Lian said this, Mo Qingyun frowned and got up without hesitation. “Let’s go.”

“Alright!”

When Mo Qingyun said this, Chi Lian and Wan Lianyun nodded in agreement. They left the Xue family together.

After leaving the Xue family, Mo Qingyun separated from Wan Lianyun and returned to Jade Pavilion with Chi Lian.

“Young Master, I want to refine the essence blood of those people just now.” After returning to Jade Pavilion, Chi Lian said to Mo Qingyun.

“Mm-hmm, go ahead!” Mo Qingyun nodded in agreement after hearing Chi Lian’s request.

Subsequently, Mo Qingyun returned to his residence and entered into cultivation, waiting for the three-day alchemy competition with Xue Xiao.

Chapter 151 Prelude to a Storm

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.

At this moment, within Mount Tai Sect.

A powerful aura emanated from a secret room and instantly covered the entire Mount Tai Sect.

Half-step Alchemy Mansion, the person emitting this powerful aura was a half-step alchemy mansion realm powerhouse.

If others knew that Mount Tai Sect harbored such a powerful figure, they would be shocked beyond belief.

“Haha, I finally broke through to the half-step alchemy mansion realm.”

Following this powerful aura was a domineering laugh that instantly spread throughout Mount Tai Sect. “Wan Lianyun, for the grudge of old, we should settle it properly.”

After this person spoke, he walked into a secret room and stood in the air above Mount Tai Sect.

Half-step alchemy mansion, already possessing some of the abilities of an alchemy mansion realm powerhouse, standing in mid-air was something that could be勉强accomplished.

As this person stood above Mount Tai Sect, the people within were immediately stirred and approached him one after another.

When Tai Zhenhai saw this person in mid-air, his face immediately showed joy. He said excitedly to him, “Great-uncle, your cultivation has broken through to the half-step alchemy mansion realm?”

Hearing Tai Zhenhai’s words, Xue Haotian revealed a look of satisfaction and said, “Zhenhai, you’ve done well. Under your management, Mount Tai Sect is in perfect order.”

“Thank Great-uncle for the praise. These are things I should do,” Tai Zhenhai said humbly after hearing Xue Haotian’s words.

“Eh! There is an alchemy mansion realm powerhouse aura!”

As Tai Zhenhai spoke, Xue Haotian suddenly frowned and moved his body to the side at high speed.

Seeing Xue Haotian’s actions, Tai Zhenhai immediately changed his expression and hurriedly followed, explaining, “Great-uncle, don’t be alarmed. Mister Yuan Sheng is on our side.”

“Hm?”

Hearing Tai Zhenhai’s words, Xue Haotian stopped his body and looked at the half-step alchemy mansion realm powerhouse Yuan Sheng with surprise. He said calmly, “Mister Yuan Sheng, your visit to our Mount Tai Sect is an honor.”

“Haha, Mister Xue is being too polite,” Yuan Sheng said with a smile after hearing Xue Haotian’s courteous words.

“Xiao, greet the old ancestor!” At this moment, as Xue Haotian and Yuan Sheng exchanged pleasantries, the Xue Xiao beside Yuan Sheng greeted Xue Haotian respectfully.

“Xiao, no need to be so formal,” Xue Haotian said with a smile after looking at Xue Xiao. “I’ve heard about your matters, becoming a fourth-rank alchemy master at such a young age. Not bad, not bad.”

Hearing Xue Haotian’s praise, Xue Xiao responded humbly, “Thank the old ancestor for the compliment. My achievements today are due to my master and elders’ guidance.”

“Not arrogant, very good!” Seeing Xue Xiao’s expression, Xue Haotian nodded in satisfaction again.

“Mister Xue, Tai Sect Master, Xiao Young Master still has to compete in alchemy with Mo Family’s young man. We should go early,” Yuan Sheng reminded them as they talked.

“Alchemy competition?”

Hearing this, Xue Haotian looked puzzled.

“It’s like this…” As Tai Zhenhai and the others explained to Xue Haotian, they got up and headed towards Alchemy Master Alliance Guild.

...

In Jade Pavilion, Mo Qingyun’s residence.

“Nascent Soul realm ninth level aura!”

At this moment, Mo Qingyun, who was in cultivation, suddenly opened his eyes with a look of surprise. He thought to himself, “Chi Lian’s cultivation has broken through to Nascent Soul realm ninth level. Currently, this is a good thing.”

After making this discovery, Mo Qingyun moved his body and headed towards Chi Lian’s residence.

“Young Master!”

Seeing Mo Qingyun arrive, Chi Lian smiled faintly and got up to greet him.

“The time for the alchemy competition is almost here. Let’s go,” Mo Qingyun said to Chi Lian and got up, heading towards the Jade Pavilion’s assembly hall.

“Yes!”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Chi Lian nodded and followed him out of the courtyard.

Moments later, Mo Qingyun and Chi Lian arrived at the assembly hall. Mo Hongtian and others were already waiting there.

Seeing everyone, Mo Qingyun was somewhat surprised. The few girls he hadn’t seen for months—Mo Ling and others—were actually in the crowd.

After several months of cultivation, Mo Xin’s cultivation had reached True Qi realm fourth level, and Mo Xiao’s was at second level.

As for Mo Ling, due to her constitution, she hadn’t started cultivation yet. But following the Qi guiding method Mo Qingyun taught her, the flames within her body were stabilized.

Seeing Mo Qingyun arrive, Mo Hongtian smiled faintly and said to him, “Qingyun, let’s go.”

“Grandfather, wait a moment!” Hearing Mo Hongtian’s words, Mo Qingyun frowned slightly and said after a brief pause, “This time, Xiao Young Master and I are in a life-or-death competition. After I win Xiao Young Master, I will definitely kill him. But the half-step alchemy mansion realm powerhouse beside him won’t just let it go.”

Mo Qingyun paused and said, “Therefore, this alchemy competition will be extremely dangerous. So I think that the clan members below Nascent Soul realm should not go this time.”

“Stinky kid, are you嫌弃we have low cultivation and will hold you back?”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Mo Xin glared at him and said unhappily.

“Uh!”

Being called out by Mo Xin, Mo Qingyun felt a bit annoyed. This girl really knows how to make things difficult for him.

“Pfft!”

As Mo Qingyun smiled bitterly, Mo Xin laughed sweetly and said with a reproachful look, “Alright, alright. I was just joking. A sneeze from a half-step alchemy mansion realm powerhouse can injure me, so I won’t go to that commotion. But you should be careful.”

A sneeze can injure her?

Hearing Mo Xin’s words, the Mo Family members were all dumbfounded. This girl really knows how to make comparisons.

But this is also a fact, after all, the difference between True Qi realm and half-step alchemy mansion realm is too great.

“Mm-hmm!”

Seeing Mo Xin’s words, Mo Qingyun sighed in relief and nodded.

At this moment, Mo Hongtian said, “Since that’s the case, for safety reasons, clan members below Nascent Soul realm should not go this time.”

Knowing Mo Qingyun’s thoughts, the Mo Family members did not show any dissatisfaction with his arrangement.

They knew that Mo Qingyun was doing this for their safety.

Subsequently, Mo Qingyun and the others left Jade Pavilion and headed towards Alchemy Master Alliance Guild.

In the end, only Mo Hongtian, Mo Kuixin, and Mo Yuruo accompanied Mo Qingyun to Alchemy Master Alliance Guild.

With the help of the fire attribute essence crystal provided by Mo Qingyun, their cultivation had successfully broken through to Nascent Soul realm.

Half an hour later, Mo Qingyun and the others arrived at Alchemy Master Alliance Guild.

After arriving at Alchemy Master Alliance Guild, Mo Qingyun and the others directly went to the alchemy square within the guild.

At this moment, the alchemy square was packed with people. Most of the influential figures in Lianyun City were there.

“That’s Young Master Dan, they say he will compete with Xiao Young Master in alchemy and it’s a life-or-death competition.”

“Xiao Young Master is actually a fourth-rank alchemy master, can Young Master Dan win?”

“I think it’s uncertain. But I’m looking forward to it.”

...

Seeing Mo Qingyun arrive, everyone started whispering.

Mo Qingyun didn’t pay attention to their reactions and walked towards Du Luo and the others on the high platform.

Du Luo and the others from City Lord’s Mansion greeted him with a smile when they saw Mo Qingyun arrive.

As for the people from Heavenly Dragon Gang and Mount Tai Sect, they were sitting on a high platform opposite Du Luo’s group, forming a confrontational scene.

At this moment, everyone felt that there was a strong sense of tension in the air at the alchemy square.

Chapter 152 What is Alchemy? (Second Update)

“Teacher, City Lord Wan, Elders…” Mo Qingyun greeted everyone after approaching.

“Young Master Dan, just do your best. The rest is up to us,” Wan Lianyun said with a smile after seeing Mo Qingyun approach.

“Exactly, just focus on alchemy. The rest we old guys will handle,” Zhao Qi said solemnly after Wan Lianyun’s words.

“Mm-hmm!”

Hearing everyone’s encouragement, Mo Qingyun nodded and walked towards the center of the alchemy square.

When Mo Qingyun arrived at the center of the alchemy square, Xiao Young Master also came here with a cold smile on his face.

Seeing Mo Qingyun arrive, the judge beside him said seriously, “Since both of you are here, let’s start the alchemy competition.”

“Kid, your courage is not small. You really dare to come,” Xiao Young Master said after sizing up Mo Qingyun with a cold smile. “I’ll give you one last chance, now hand over the City Lord’s token and kneel down to beg for mercy. Self-destruct your cultivation, I’ll spare you a dog’s life.”

Mo Qingyun looked at Xiao Young Master disdainfully and said, “Even if you beg for mercy now and self-destruct your cultivation, I won’t spare your dog’s life.”

“Humph! Not seeing the coffin won’t shed tears. I’ll see how your alchemy skills are.”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Xiao Young Master snorted and took out his alchemy cauldron.

Seeing Xiao Young Master take out the alchemy cauldron, Mo Qingyun didn’t hesitate and took out the Chiyan Cauldron given to him by Xu Yu.

Clang, clang!

The two alchemy cauldrons fell on the ground and made a metallic sound, stirring up dust.

“Mystic-grade alchemy cauldron!”

Seeing the Chiyan Cauldron Mo Qingyun took out, Xiao Young Master sneered and said with a curled lip, “You have the nerve to bring this street vendor-grade alchemy cauldron.”

The grade of Xiao Young Master’s alchemy cauldron was lower-grade treasure, indeed higher in rank than Mo Qingyun’s Chiyan Cauldron.

The quality of the alchemy cauldron is very important for an alchemist. It can greatly assist in controlling flames and increasing the success rate of refining pills.

“Relying on an alchemy cauldron?”

Hearing Xiao Young Master’s words, Mo Qingyun looked at him disdainfully and said with a mocking smile, “After you say that, I suddenly realize that using a Mystic-grade alchemy cauldron to compete with you in alchemy seems a bit wasteful. An ordinary alchemy cauldron would suffice.”

After saying this, Mo Qingyun put away the Chiyan Cauldron and said to the judge beside him, “Get me an ordinary alchemy cauldron.”

“An ordinary alchemy cauldron?”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s request, the judge beside him was stunned. What is he going to do?

He and a fourth-rank alchemy master are competing in alchemy, yet he plans to use the most inferior ordinary alchemy cauldron?

Is he crazy?

Or is he courting death?

“You… are sure you want an ordinary alchemy cauldron?”

The judge beside him asked Mo Qingyun in surprise.

“Yes!”

Mo Qingyun nodded seriously.

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s determination, the judge didn’t say anything more and instructed someone to get an ordinary alchemy cauldron for Mo Qingyun.

Compared to the shock of others, Xiao Young Master felt more that Mo Qingyun was humiliating him.

Mo Qingyun’s actions clearly showed his disdain for Xiao Young Master, thinking that he could easily win with an ordinary alchemy cauldron.

“Youngster, since you are looking for death, I’ll fulfill your wish.”

Thinking this way, Xiao Young Master said coldly, “I hope you don’t use the poor quality of your alchemy cauldron as an excuse to cheat after losing.”

“I don’t need you to worry about that,” Mo Qingyun said calmly. “I also hope you don’t use the high quality of your alchemy cauldron as an excuse to cheat after losing.”

“Humph!”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Xiao Young Master snorted and started refining pills without further ado.

Clang!

When Xiao Young Master began refining pills, the ordinary alchemy cauldron Mo Qingyun requested was brought over.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun said with a faint smile to Xiao Young Master, “Do you want to check it?”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Xiao Young Master’s face darkened. Mo Qingyun was clearly annoying him.

The alchemy cauldron in front of Mo Qingyun, anyone who wasn’t blind could see its quality.

The rough craftsmanship made it look like a clay pot, almost indistinguishable from scrap iron. But the more inferior Mo Qingyun’s alchemy cauldron was, the more uncomfortable Xiao Young Master felt. The feeling of being ridiculed grew stronger.

If he lost in the end, it would be a huge embarrassment for him.

However, at this moment when Xiao Young Master was feeling depressed, Mo Qingyun made a sound of disapproval and said calmly, “Hmmph, using such an advanced alchemy cauldron to compete is a bit of a waste.”

An advanced alchemy cauldron?

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, everyone around him looked at each other in confusion. They didn’t know what to say.

Brother, although the weather is good and there’s no thunderbolt for boasting, are you really okay with this?

Everyone thought the same thing at that moment.

“Qingyun, what is this young man doing? Using such a low-grade alchemy cauldron to compete in refining pills will be at a disadvantage.”

“Never mind, there’s no point saying more now. Let’s just wait and see what happens.”

“A few of you don’t need to worry too much. From my perspective, Mo Young Master must have his reasons for doing this.”

...

At this moment, Du Luo and the others beside him expressed their thoughts.

When Du Luo and the others showed concern, Tai Zhenhai and the others from Mount Tai Sect and Heavenly Dragon Gang all wore sneering smiles.

“This Mo Family brat is looking for death, using such a low-grade alchemy cauldron to compete with Xiao Young Master in refining pills.”

“No matter what tricks he plays, the result will be the same.”

“After this competition ends, I’ll personally kill him and let him know the consequences of offending our Xue Family.”

“We not only have to deal with this young man, but also Mo Family, City Lord’s Mansion, and the few old ghosts from Du Family. We’ll settle them all this time.”

“Exactly, with Mister Yuan Sheng and Great-uncle’s two half-step alchemy mansion realm experts here, we can easily deal with them.”

...

At this moment, everyone from Mount Tai Sect and Heavenly Dragon Gang wore cold smiles.

In the center of the alchemy square.

When everyone was in their own thoughts, Mo Qingyun finally started working and took out the refining materials one by one.

In no time, Ice Soul Spirit Grass, Fire Sun Fruit, Bamboo Cloud Flower, and Dark Illusion Wave Day Branch appeared in front of him.

Start

After taking out the refining materials, Mo Qingyun raised his hand and infused a soul flame into the alchemy cauldron.

Demon Flame! Who would have thought that Young Master Dan actually controls such a flame, truly living up to his reputation.

When Mo Qingyun infused the soul flame into the alchemy cauldron, a shocking heat wave instantly arose, making everyone around him change color.

At the same time, when everyone saw Xiao Young Master’s actions, they were once again shocked.

“Look quickly, Xiao Young Master has such a superb alchemy technique. His movements are light and nimble, like a dragon skimming the water.”

“That’s called Dragon Skimming Water technique. It’s a very powerful alchemy technique, and Xiao Young Master actually mastered it.”

“Not only Dragon Skimming Water but also Wild Goose Breaking Wave, an even more powerful alchemy technique.”

“This Xiao Young Master is so skilled. No wonder he’s a fourth-rank alchemy master!”

...

Seeing Xiao Young Master’s hand movements, everyone was amazed.

Hearing the words around him, Xiao Young Master smiled smugly and said to Mo Qingyun, “Youngster, you haven’t seen such advanced alchemy techniques before. Today I’ll let you see what refining pills is.”

“Let me see what refining pills is?”

Hearing Xiao Young Master’s words, Mo Qingyun curled his lips and said with a playful smile.

Chapter 153 I Haven’t Finished Refining Yet (Third Update)

After Mo Qingyun said this, he raised his hand and pointed at the refining materials beside him.

With Mo Qingyun’s point, these refining materials leaped into the cauldron like little fish.

This is Dragon Leaping Over the Dragon Gate technique!

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s alchemy technique, some people who understood alchemy were instantly shocked.

This alchemy technique is much more advanced than Xiao Young Master’s Dragon Skimming Water and Wild Goose Breaking Wave techniques.

Even many fourth-rank alchemy masters couldn’t master this technique, yet Mo Qingyun had mastered it.

This scene was truly beyond everyone’s expectations.

Roar!

At this moment, when everyone was shocked, the soul flame in the alchemy cauldron transformed into a beast form and swallowed all the refining materials.

After swallowing the refining materials, the soul flame beast started jumping rapidly.

With each jump, the purity of the refining materials in its belly increased by a fraction.

“This… This is Divine Beast Cauldron technique. Young Master Dan actually mastered this alchemy technique.”

“Dragon Leaping Over the Dragon Gate, Divine Beast Cauldron. I’m fortunate to see such alchemy techniques in my lifetime.”

“Talent, an alchemy prodigy! In just a few months, Young Master Dan’s refining ability has grown to this level.”

...

At this moment, some people who knew Mo Qingyun couldn’t help but exclaim.

They clearly remembered that a few months ago, Mo Qingyun just entered Alchemy Master Alliance Guild and was taken as a disciple by Du Luo’s trio.

At that time, Mo Qingyun’s refining level was only top-grade first rank.

But just a few months later, his refining ability had grown to this level.

This growth speed was truly shocking and unbelievable.

“No… Impossible, how could this young man know such advanced alchemy techniques.”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s technique, Xiao Young Master’s face darkened with disbelief.

At this moment, he felt a hint of unease. He seemed to have underestimated Mo Qingyun.

After a brief panic, Xiao Young Master’s face turned grim and he consoled himself, “Humph! What does having advanced alchemy techniques mean? Refining pills isn’t just about having advanced techniques.”

After consoling himself, Xiao Young Master put aside his disdain and fully focused on refining pills.

Mo Qingyun didn’t pay attention to Xiao Young Master’s performance but also fully immersed himself in refining pills.

When Xiao Young Master was fully focused on refining, he began controlling the flames to refine the materials in the alchemy cauldron.

Under Xiao Young Master’s control, the flames in the alchemy cauldron were like a wild dragon, rapidly moving within it.

With this rapid movement of the flames, the refining materials in the alchemy cauldron were rapidly purified.

Soon, Xiao Young Master’s refining materials were completely purified and turned into a green medicinal liquid.

Seeing the purification complete, Xiao Young Master sneered and compressed the medicinal liquid into a pill.

Roar roar roar...

While Xiao Young Master was fully focused on purifying the refining materials, Mo Qingyun also controlled the soul flame beast to rapidly purify the refining materials.

At this moment, the soul flame beast jumped faster and its body became more transparent, indicating that the purity of the refining materials was increasing.

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s performance, everyone from Mount Tai Sect and Heavenly Dragon Gang looked grim.

At this moment, they realized that they had underestimated Mo Qingyun’s refining ability.

This realization made their confidence in Xiao Young Master’s victory waver slightly.

“We seem to have underestimated this young man. He actually has some skills.”

“Although he’s skilled, he’s too arrogant. Using the most ordinary alchemy cauldron to refine pills is a sign of overconfidence.”

“I’m very curious. If he loses because of the alchemy cauldron, I wonder if this young man will go mad.”

...

Thinking about Mo Qingyun’s defeat, everyone from Heavenly Dragon Gang and Mount Tai Sect wore sneering smiles.

The time passed slowly during Mo Qingyun’s and Xiao Young Master’s refining process.

Half an hour later.

The flames in Xiao Young Master’s alchemy cauldron suddenly surged, transforming into a flame lotus that enveloped the medicinal liquid.

Next, everyone saw the flame lotus slowly bloom, forming a lotus pod in the center.

Inside the lotus pod was a green lotus seed, which was the pill Xiao Young Master refined.

This is Lotus Bloom technique!

Seeing Xiao Young Master’s performance, everyone around him changed their expressions and were shocked.

Lotus Bloom technique is a refining technique that only fifth-rank alchemy masters can master.

Who would have thought that Xiao Young Master, a fourth-rank alchemy master, actually mastered it.

Xiao Young Master’s refining ability is indeed extraordinary.

At this moment, after the lotus seed formed, a rich medicinal aroma instantly spread throughout the alchemy square.

Xiao Young Master’s pill was successfully refined!

“What a rich medicinal aroma. The grade of Xiao Young Master’s pill is at least mid-grade fourth rank!”

“Successfully refining a fourth-rank pill in less than an hour, no wonder he’s a fourth-rank alchemy master.”

“What kind of pill did Xiao Young Master refine? What effects will it have when taken?”

...

Seeing Xiao Young Master’s success, everyone around him changed color and showed curiosity.

“Fourth-rank high-grade pill, Yang Nourishing Essence Refining Pill. When taken, it can strengthen the Nascent Soul.”

Xiao Young Master took the pill in his hand and introduced it to everyone before handing it over to the judge, “Please check the grade of the pill!”

Hearing Xiao Young Master’s words, the judge took the pill and handed it to others for inspection.

“It is indeed a high-grade fourth-rank pill. The concentration of medicinal essence can be felt just from the quality.”

“Considering its color, it’s an excellent high-grade fourth-rank pill among them.”

“If we were to evaluate it, this pill’s grade can be considered as near-fifth rank.”

...

After receiving the pill, everyone around him gave their opinions.

In the end, Xiao Young Master’s pill was determined to be near-fifth rank.

Near-fifth-rank pill, Xiao Young Master’s refined pill reached near-fifth rank.

Hearing this result, everyone changed color and worried about Mo Qingyun.

Xiao Young Master refined a near-fifth-rank pill, can Mo Qingyun win?

“Near-fifth rank pill, this is troublesome. I didn’t expect Xiao Young Master’s refining ability to be so high.”

Du Luo frowned and said with a worried tone, “Xiao Young Master’s refining ability is so high.”

Hearing Du Luo’s words, the others beside him were also worried. A near-fifth-rank pill was truly shocking.

Compared to Du Luo’s worry, everyone from Mount Tai Sect and Heavenly Dragon Gang wore smug smiles.

“Xiao Young Master did well, refining a near-fifth-rank pill. This young man is surely defeated.”

“With Xiao Young Master’s talent, it won’t be long before he becomes a fifth-rank alchemy master and one of the top alchemy masters in Xia Kingdom.”

“Haha, congratulations Mister Xue. Your family has such an outstanding young man in Xiao Young Master.”

“Mister Yuan Sheng is being too polite. Xiao Young Master’s success is due to Du Family’s cultivation.”

...

Everyone from Mount Tai Sect and Heavenly Dragon Gang expressed their smugness.

In the center of the alchemy square.

Seeing his pill’s grade determined, Xiao Young Master sneered and said to Mo Qingyun, “Youngster, did you hear that? The grade of my pill is near-fifth rank. You haven’t seen such a high-grade pill before, right? Before you die, seeing this grade of pill will make your death worth it.”

After saying this, Xiao Young Master raised his hand and struck at Mo Qingyun, sneering, “Youngster, give up. The grade of your pill can’t surpass mine. Let me send you on your way.”

“Get lost!”

Seeing Xiao Young Master’s agitation, Mo Qingyun’s face darkened and he snorted coldly before retaliating.

Fire Dragon Seal

At this moment, Mo Qingyun’s face was grim. He raised a hand and unleashed a palm strike.

With Mo Qingyun’s palm, forty-nine Fire Dragon Battle Seals rapidly condensed and transformed into a Fire Dragon Battle Shield, heading towards Xiao Young Master.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun didn’t hold back and unleashed the Fire Essence Principle directly.

Bang!

Facing the Fire Dragon Battle Shield, Xiao Young Master’s face changed and he struck it with a palm, producing a muffled sound.

At the same time, Xiao Young Master’s attack was blocked by the Fire Dragon Battle Shield.

Not only that, but Xiao Young Master also looked rather disheveled from the unexpected attack of the Fire Dragon Battle Shield.

Seeing his strike blocked by Mo Qingyun, Xiao Young Master’s face darkened and he asked Mo Qingyun angrily.

“Youngster, are you going to break the bet?”

“Hurry what? My pill isn’t finished refining yet.”

Hearing Xiao Young Master’s words, Mo Qingyun curled his lips and said with a playful smile, narrowing his eyes at Xiao Young Master.

Chapter 154 Xiao Young Master, Die!

Seeing Xiao Young Master attack Mo Qingyun, Chi Lian moved and came beside him to protect him.

After coming beside Mo Qingyun, Chi Lian released a powerful aura that pressed towards Xiao Young Master.

Thud thud thud!

Under Chi Lian’s pressure, Xiao Young Master retreated several steps and was half-kneeling on the ground with a flushed face.

“Xiao Young Master!”

Seeing Xiao Young Master under Chi Lian’s pressure, everyone from Mount Tai Sect and Heavenly Dragon Gang changed their expressions and rushed to Xiao Young Master’s side.

After arriving at Xiao Young Master’s side, Tai Zhenhai and the others looked grim and said coldly to Chi Lian.

“Sir, you’ve been too bold.”

“Bold?”

Hearing Tai Zhenhai’s words, Chi Lian’s eyes flashed with a blood light and he said coldly, “The competition hasn’t ended. This young man interfering with Young Master is also being bold?”

As Chi Lian spoke, Wan Lianyun and the others came beside Mo Qingyun and said, “Qingyun’s refining isn’t finished. Xiao Young Master interfering now, are you worried about losing?”

“Interfering with the opponent during a competition is indeed shameful.”

“Yes, although Young Master Dan’s chances of winning aren’t high, he shouldn’t be interfered with during his refining.”

“Could it be that Xiao Young Master is interfering because he’s nervous and afraid?”

“Yes, considering the refining techniques, it seems that Young Master Dan is better.”

...

Everyone around them expressed their opinions.

“Humph!”

Hearing Chi Lian and the others’ words, Tai Zhenhai snorted and said, “Xiao Young Master refined a near-fifth-rank pill. Isn’t that enough? Do you think this young man can refine a fifth-rank pill?”

Hearing Tai Zhenhai’s words, Du Luo and the others fell silent, not knowing how to respond.

To be honest, they didn’t have much hope that Mo Qingyun could refine a fifth-rank pill.

Fifth-rank pills, the difficulty to successfully refine them is too great.

“Can he refine a fifth-rank pill? We’ll know after I finish refining.”

At this moment, when Du Luo and the others were speechless, Mo Qingyun smiled playfully at Tai Zhenhai and the others.

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Tai Zhenhai’s face darkened again and he said coldly, “Youngster, if you keep refining like this, do we have to wait forever?”

“Since you’re so eager for Xiao Young Master’s death, I’ll fulfill your wish.”

Mo Qingyun curled his lips and looked at Xiao Young Master with a playful smile, saying calmly, “Although it’s still lacking some refinement, it’s enough to win you.”

“Big talk!”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Xiao Young Master’s expression changed and he responded coldly.

But if one listened carefully, they could hear that Xiao Young Master’s confidence was already lacking.

At this moment, the unease in Xiao Young Master’s heart intensified slightly.

Just then,

“Concentrate!”

Under everyone’s gaze, Mo Qingyun controlled the soul flame to compress the medicinal liquid and form a pill.

Roar roar!

Under Mo Qingyun’s control, the soul flame transformed into two small fire dragons that surrounded the medicinal liquid and played with it.

Two Dragons Playing with a Pearl!

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s technique, everyone’s expressions changed dramatically and they almost couldn’t believe their eyes.

Two Dragons Playing with a Pearl, this profound refining technique has always been in legend within Xia Kingdom.

It was said that only some alchemy families in the Great Yan Dynasty knew this refining technique.

Who would have thought that Mo Qingyun actually mastered it, which was truly shocking and unexpected.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun’s image in everyone’s hearts became mysterious.

Could it be that Young Master Dan and those powerful forces have some connection?

Whoosh!

Moments later, the two small fire dragons circled around the pill for a while and then directly entered into it.

Subsequently, a medicinal aroma instantly spread throughout the alchemy square.
