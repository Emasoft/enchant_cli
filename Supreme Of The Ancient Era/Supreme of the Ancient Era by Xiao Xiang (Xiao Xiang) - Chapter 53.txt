“That is certainly the case, the Thunder Kingdom ranks among the top hundred kingdoms in the Great Yan Dynasty.”

…

Seeing that silver-haired man, Lei Hong appear, everyone around him showed expressions of awe and whispered among themselves.

At this moment, Long Yutian beside saw Lei Hong and his expression tightened up as well. It seemed that he felt considerable pressure facing Lei Hong.

Mo Qingyun had a relatively good impression of Long Yutian’s appearance. Seeing this, he smiled faintly and said to Long Yutian, “Friend, I appreciate your kindness. Let me handle this myself.”

“Handle it yourself?”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Long Yutian was taken aback and somewhat surprised by Mo Qingyun's decision.

In his view, with Mo Qingyun’s True Essence Realm First Stage cultivation, not only could he not contend against Lei Hong, but even one of Lei Hong’s subordinates would likely be able to finish him off in a minute.

However, since Mo Qingyun had said so, Long Yutian did not say much and nodded in response, “If that’s the case, be careful.”

“Trouble you to take care of my brothers for me.”

As Long Yutian stepped back, Mo Qingyun pointed at Ling Luo beside and asked Long Yutian for a favor.

“No problem!” Upon hearing this, Long Yutian immediately nodded in agreement.

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s arrangement, Ling Luo showed a proud expression and patted his chest with great spirit, saying, “Boss, I’ll fight them alongside you. At worst, we die together.”

Seeing Ling Luo’s actions at this moment, Mo Qingyun felt a thread of emotion rise in his heart and smiled faintly, “Just some minor henchmen. No need to make a fuss; I can handle it alone.”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s insistence, Ling Luo hesitated slightly and followed Long Yutian to the side with a tense expression.

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s actions at this moment, everyone around immediately changed their expressions and were somewhat shocked by his actions.

“What’s wrong with this kid? Not only did he reject Long Yutian's help, but also asked his brothers to step aside.”

“He probably thinks that even if Long Yutian and his brother join hands, they have no chance of winning.”

“Although this kid gives the impression of being arrogant, he is indeed very loyal and worth befriending.”

“Too bad, such a loyal person will soon die.”

…

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s actions, everyone around sighed with regret.

Perhaps in their view, the result of Mo Qingyun facing Lei Hong and others was certain death.

“Foolish kid, wanting to contend with us alone.”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s actions, Lei Hong's disdainful expression deepened.

At this moment, when Lei Hong spoke with disdain, Lei Lie behind him sneered and walked forward, saying, “Brother Lei Hong, go rest aside. Let me deal with this kid.”

“Alright, quick battle!”

Seeing Lei Lie volunteering to fight, Lei Hong nodded in agreement.

Then, with a disdainful look on his face, he looked at Mo Qingyun and said, “Kid, you’re not worthy of my hand. Let Thunder Strike play with you; it’s an honor for you.”

“Is that so?”

Hearing Lei Hong's words, Mo Qingyun smiled with deep meaning and replied to him. Then he looked at Lei Lie coldly, saying, “Since you’re eager to come and die, I’ll make it happen for you.”

“Kid, talking big won’t hurt your tongue. Let’s see what skills you have.”

After Lei Lie spoke, he attacked Mo Qingyun without reservation, releasing his True Essence Realm Fourth Stage aura.

Fierce Thunder Lion Mane

Lei Lie punched out, and terrifying lightning surged on his fist, forming a huge lion-shaped lightning shadow.

Roar!

As soon as this lion-shaped lightning shadow formed, it let out a roar and lunged at Mo Qingyun with imposing momentum.

“This… This is the Earth Rank Middle Stage martial technique Fierce Thunder Lion Mane. I didn’t expect Lei Lie Captain to have cultivated it successfully.”

“Lei Lie Captain has refined the martial technique Fierce Thunder Lion Mane to a high level, truly amazing.”

“With Lei Lie Captain’s current cultivation, he can probably fight against True Essence Fifth Stage. This kid is doomed.”

…

Seeing Lei Lie’s move, the people from the Thunder Kingdom beside him showed smug smiles.

Gravity Suppression!

Seeing Lei Lie’s approach, a faint smile appeared on Mo Qingyun's lips as he released the essence of earth.

Under the gravity suppression from the essence of earth, Lei Lie’s body sank and almost fell over with a stagger.

“O… Essence Power!”

Feeling the gravity suppression on his body, Lei Lie’s expression twitched and showed a look of shock.

This kid in front actually comprehended essence power; it was truly unbelievable.

Ninefold Collapse

At this moment, when Lei Lie was shocked, Mo Qingyun raised his fist and punched straight at Lei Lie’s dantian.

Bang bang bang…

Then, a surge of astonishing essence energy gushed out from Mo Qingyun’s fist and surged into Lei Lie’s body like a tidal wave.

Under this overwhelming attack, Lei Lie was directly blown away and his aura rapidly weakened.

Puh!

After falling to the ground, Lei Lie immediately spat out blood and his complexion turned pale with a faint breath.

In one move, Lei Lie was incapacitated!

Seeing this scene in front of them, everyone around immediately went dumbfounded and could not believe their eyes.

True Essence Realm Fourth Stage Lei Lie, after displaying an Earth Rank martial technique, was actually incapacitated by this True Essence Realm First Stage kid in one move.

This situation was too abnormal for them to accept.

In their view, the current result should be more reasonable.

“You… You actually incapacitated my cultivation!”

Amidst everyone’s shock, Lei Lie showed a resentful expression and pointed at Mo Qingyun with his teeth clenched.

Ignoring Lei Lie’s agitation, Mo Qingyun turned to look at Lei Hong and others and said, “Too weak. All of you come on!”

Chapter 196 You Are Too Naive()

“I didn’t hear wrong, that kid intends to challenge the Thunder Kingdom alone.”

“Too arrogant. But one must admit his strength is indeed formidable.”

“No matter what, challenging a kingdom alone with just one person is too reckless.”

…

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, everyone around stirred and whispered among themselves.

“Boss incapacitated Lei Lie in one move. Too cool.”

Seeing Lei Lie being incapacitated by Mo Qingyun, Ling Luo beside immediately showed an excited expression and clenched his fists.

He looked as if he had incapacitated Lei Lie himself.

“Seems I underestimated this time.”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s performance, Long Yutian’s expression changed and showed a hint of surprise.

At the same time, his somewhat lazy demeanor became serious, muttering to himself, “With these two’s strength, they indeed meet the requirements. Their character is also very good; seems worth considering.”

Long Yutian showed a thoughtful expression as if making some decision.

Amidst everyone’s shock at Mo Qingyun’s actions, Lei Hong heard Mo Qingyun’s words and immediately showed a grim expression.

Just now he said that Mo Qingyun was not worthy of his hand, but now Mo Qingyun turned around and asked them to join hands. This was undoubtedly a provocation.

Indirectly saying that he alone is not Mo Qingyun’s match.

Thinking this, Lei Hong's expression darkened and looked at Mo Qingyun with slight anger, “Kid, not too self-assured. Don’t think defeating Lei Lie makes you invincible; I alone can deal with you.”

After speaking, Lei Hong stood up and walked forward to confront Mo Qingyun.

“You?”

Seeing the approaching Lei Hong, Mo Qingyun sized him up and said with a sneer, “Not yet!”

“Humph! Big talk!”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s dismissive words, Lei Hong snorted and said with gritted teeth, “Kid, I’ll let you know the consequences of offending my Thunder Kingdom. You’ll regret your actions.”

Thunder Dragon Chasing Sun

After speaking, Lei Hong moved and rushed towards Mo Qingyun with a terrifying aura.

As this aura erupted, a terrifying essence energy wave surged out from Lei Hong’s surroundings like an erupting volcano.

This surging essence energy formed a silver-colored thunder dragon, carrying a ferocious aura and charged towards Mo Qingyun with overwhelming power.

Roar!

As the thunder dragon flew, it twisted its body and emitted dazzling light that was hard to look at.

Seeing this scene, everyone’s expressions changed with awe towards Lei Hong's attack.

“Lei Hong is indeed someone who can kill high-stage True Essence Realm demonic beasts. This move is truly terrifying.”

“With this attack, even a high-stage True Essence Realm person would dare not confront it head-on.”

“That kid is in trouble. This attack is beyond what a True Essence Realm First Stage can withstand.”

…

For a moment, everyone around changed their expressions and could not help but sigh.

At this moment, as everyone was marveling in their hearts,

Fire Dragon Seal

Mo Qingyun watched the rapidly approaching thunder dragon and quickly formed hand seals.

After forming these hand seals, forty-nine miniature fire dragons appeared in front of Mo Qingyun, transforming into Fire Dragon Battle Seals.

As the Fire Dragon Battle Seals formed, they converged together to form a huge flame shield.

“Suppress it for me!”

Seeing the Fire Dragon Battle Seals formed, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and controlled the fire dragon battle shield to suppress the thunder dragon.

Then, the flame shield and the thunder dragon fiercely collided like two frenzied bulls fighting with their horns, trying to knock each other down.

Boom boom boom…

For a moment, the scene was intense with every collision causing lightning to swirl and flames to burst forth, releasing a surging essence energy wave.

Under this essence energy’s rampage, the earth shook and the sky changed color as if the end was near.

Seeing this scene, everyone’s hearts trembled involuntarily and showed a look of awe.

Fierce Bird Break

After using the Fire Dragon Battle Seals to block Lei Hong’s attack, Mo Qingyun did not hold back and rushed towards Lei Hong.

As he moved, Mo Qingyun turned into a streak of light and instantly reached Lei Hong’s front.

At the same time, sharp wind blades appeared around Mo Qingyun’s body.

“Wind… Wind Essence Power!”

Feeling the aura from Mo Qingyun’s body, Lei Hong’s expression changed and a sense of fear rose in his heart.

Mo Qingyun’s current move greatly exceeded his understanding.

True Essence Realm First Stage cultivation, actually comprehending essence power; this method was too terrifying.

Burning Sun Mountain-Cleaving Saber

Ignoring Lei Hong’s shock, Mo Qingyun took out the Fire Silk Saber and slashed at Lei Hong.

As he slashed, a brilliant light burst from the Fire Silk Saber, releasing terrifying flames.

These flames spread out like a fire dragon and fiercely swallowed Lei Hong.

“Fire… Fire Essence Power!”

Seeing the approaching fire dragon saber light, Lei Hong’s heart trembled again and his expression showed fear.

Two essences; this True Essence Realm First Stage kid actually comprehended two essence powers.

“What is the background of this kid? How did he comprehend two essences with just True Essence Realm First Stage cultivation?”

At this moment, countless doubts rose in Lei Hong’s heart and he could no longer remain calm.

At this moment, Lei Hong realized that he had underestimated Mo Qingyun.

Although somewhat shocked by Mo Qingyun’s combat strength, Lei Hong did not lose his composure.

Quickly calming himself, he took out a silver drum and struck it.

Heaven Thunder Magic Wave

As Lei Hong struck the silver drum, brilliant light surged out and formed sound waves that turned into sword shadows.

Clang clang clang…

Then, these lightning sword shadows collided with the fire dragon saber light like a thousand horses charging, emitting metallic clashing sounds.

However, soon these lightning sword shadows were gradually shattered and dispersed under the fire dragon saber light’s attack.

“Such powerful attacks!”

Seeing this scene, Lei Hong’s expression changed and he felt a hint of wariness towards Mo Qingyun.

Then, his face darkened as if making some decision.

“Kid, your strength surprised me but it’s time to end this.”

After speaking coldly, Lei Hong no longer hesitated and summoned his soul beast.

Heaven Thunder Leopard, appear!

Under Lei Hong’s summoning, a huge leopard shadow covered in lightning appeared above his body.

Eleventh-level ordinary soul beast, Heaven Thunder Leopard soul beast; Lei Hong’s soul beast was a super soul beast.

“Kid, prepare to die.”

After summoning the soul beast, Lei Hong showed a cold smile and attacked Mo Qingyun.

Tiger Leopard Thunder Sound!

As Lei Hong attacked, he did not hold back and directly used his soul beast’s ability.

Moreover, under the silver drum in his hand, his soul beast’s ability became even more powerful.

Roar roar roar…

As Lei Hong’s soul beast’s ability erupted, a heart-stopping and earth-shaking beast roar sounded from the silver drum.

Under this sound wave’s impact, everyone around was pushed back连连后退，一个个连忙捂起耳朵。连续后退，一个个连忙捂住耳朵。

一些修为较弱的人，在这股音波冲击下，直接被震得口吐鲜血起来。一些修为较弱的人，在这股音波冲击下，直接被震得口吐鲜血。

“Such terrifying soul beast ability, even the residual waves make it hard for us to bear.”

“The silver drum in Lei Hong’s hand seems like the Thunder Kingdom’s sacred beast, a lower-grade divine artifact.”

“Lower-grade divine artifact; no wonder it’s so powerful. Under this sound wave attack, that kid is probably in grave danger.”

“Lei Hong is so strong; even a True Essence Ninth Stage person would find it hard to deal with this attack.”

…

Feeling Lei Hong’s attack, everyone around changed their expressions and were filled with fear.

Seeing Mo Qingyun being strongly hit by his attack, standing still without moving a muscle,

Lei Hong showed a smug smile and laughed loudly, “Kid, even if you comprehend essence power, what can you do? In the end, you still die in my hands. Two essences, I spit on it; easily defeated!”

“Two essences; that kid actually comprehended two essences. Too terrifying.”

“True Essence First Stage cultivation, comprehending two essences; how did that kid do it?”

“A prodigy like this dying at Lei Hong’s hands is truly a pity.”

“Yeah, if given the chance to raise his cultivation, he would be an extremely terrifying existence.”

…

Hearing Lei Hong’s words, everyone around was shocked again and changed their expressions.

Unable to believe that a True Essence First Stage person could comprehend two essences.

At this moment, as everyone was marveling in their hearts,

Mo Qingyun showed a faint smile and replied to Lei Hong, “You seem too happy too early.”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s expression, it seemed like nothing happened to him.

“You… You’re fine?”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s relaxed expression, Lei Hong’s face twitched and he was filled with fear.

He could not believe that his strongest attack, a move that made countless people suffer, had no effect on Mo Qingyun.

“Why should I be fine?”

Hearing Lei Hong’s words, Mo Qingyun smiled indifferently and said with a sneer, “Your lullaby to put kids to sleep; you think it can defeat me? You’re too naive.”

Lullaby to put kids to sleep?

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, everyone around felt like spitting blood and looked at him with resentful eyes.

Brother, can you stop showing off? Just now, we almost died from that Tiger Leopard Thunder Sound.

At this moment, everyone was filled with depression and felt a blow to their morale.

“Damn, Boss is truly the boss; too cool!”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s actions, Ling Luo beside showed an excited expression and ran towards Mo Qingyun with admiration in his eyes.

“Seems I underestimated him again.”

Long Yutian smiled helplessly, took a sip from his wine pot and thought to himself, “Seems no need to think much; the other two candidates are them.”

At this moment, as everyone was shocked by Mo Qingyun’s words,

Mo Qingyun coldly glanced at Lei Hong and said calmly, “Since you’re out of tricks, it’s my turn to act.”

Chapter 197 I Hate It When Others Threaten Me (Second Update)

Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon, appear!

As Mo Qingyun acted, he did so with all his might and summoned his soul beast.

Roar!

As the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon soul beast appeared, a terrifying dragon aura surged from above Mo Qingyun.

A powerful soul energy released from the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon soul beast added to Mo Qingyun’s body.

Under this soul energy’s addition, Mo Qingyun’s aura instantly became much stronger.

In addition to that, his body emitted a terrifying flame power and a faint dragon aura.

Heavenly Dragon Soul Beast!

This kid’s soul beast is actually an ancient heavenly dragon soul beast!

Seeing the crimson figure above Mo Qingyun’s body, everyone around changed their expressions and were filled with shock.

Ancient Heavenly Dragon Soul Beast; the lowest is a twelfth-level existence. Mo Qingyun’s Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon soul beast clearly is a higher-grade ancient heavenly dragon.

That means Mo Qingyun’s soul beast might not just be twelfth-level but reached a higher grade.

Thirteenth level!

When this number appeared in everyone’s hearts, they felt dazed and were shocked.

“This kid’s talent is truly terrifying. With his talent, why did his family let him enter the Hundred Kingdom Battlefield?”

“Yes! If he perishes in the Hundred Kingdom Battlefield, his family would be heartbroken.”

“Ancient Heavenly Dragon Soul Beast; this soul beast is probably a rare sight in the Great Yan Dynasty.”

…

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s soul beast, everyone around changed their expressions and were filled with shock.

According to their understanding, usually people with super soul beasts rarely appear in the Hundred Kingdom Battlefield.

Even some who entered the Hundred Kingdom Battlefield had only ordinary super soul beasts, like Lei Hong.

After all, it’s too chaotic in the Hundred Kingdom Battlefield and mainly, entering would suppress their cultivation, making soul beast advantages less obvious.

This way, some with higher-grade soul beasts might encounter various mishaps in the Hundred Kingdom Battlefield, not what their families want to see.

Especially someone like Mo Qingyun with a soul beast grade reaching twelfth-level or higher, they are treasures of their families and cannot be harmed.

Unless the day comes when their wings have grown, or better cultivation environments appear, they would leave their families.

Otherwise, such talented young ones in various great families are confined and nurtured.

“Ancient Heavenly Dragon Soul Beast!”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s soul beast, Ling Luo was taken aback and filled with shock.

After a brief moment of daze, Ling Luo showed an excited expression and said excitedly, “Boss is truly the boss; his soul beast is indeed impressive.”

“Such a powerful soul beast, his soul beast grade should be above mine.”

As Ling Luo showed excitement,

Long Yutian put down his wine pot and showed a look of shock, thinking to himself, “With such a soul beast, he should not come from small kingdoms; could it be like me?”

This thought arose,

Long Yutian showed a faint smile, took another sip from his wine pot and said calmly, “Seems there’s not just me who can’t stay still; I’ll have company in the future, heh.”

“Ancient Heavenly Dragon Soul Beast! This kid actually has such a prodigious soul beast!”

Feeling the dragon aura from the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon soul beast,

Lei Hong’s face twitched and his eyes towards Mo Qingyun showed more wariness.

At this moment, as everyone was marveling in their hearts,

Mo Qingyun attacked Lei Hong again.

Blood Power Frenzy!

As Mo Qingyun acted, he immediately used his soul beast’s ability to enhance his blood power.

With the enhancement of blood power, Mo Qingyun’s aura instantly became stronger and soon reached True Essence Third Stage peak.

True Essence Third Stage Peak!

Feeling the change in Mo Qingyun’s aura, everyone around changed their expressions and were surprised by his cultivation changes.

“Is that a soul beast ability? An ability to enhance cultivation; this is too terrifying!”

“With True Essence First Stage cultivation, he can strongly suppress Lei Hong. Now with True Essence Third Stage Peak cultivation, Lei Hong is in danger.”

“Long time since we saw a top hundred kingdom humiliated. This Thunder Kingdom hit an iron plate.”

…

For a moment, everyone sighed again with some feeling of sympathy for the rabbit.

Ignoring everyone’s shock,

Mo Qingyun used his soul beast ability and immediately attacked Lei Hong again.

Burning Sun Mountain-Cleaving Saber

Holding the Fire Silk Saber, Mo Qingyun slashed at Lei Hong with overwhelming power, acting decisively without any hesitation.

As he slashed,

essence energy surged from the Fire Silk Saber, flames roiled like a fire dragon breaking free and lunged at Lei Hong.

Wherever this saber light passed, the air was scorched and twisted as if about to be burned.

Thunder Dragon Chasing Sun

Seeing the fire dragon saber light approaching,

Lei Hong did not hesitate and immediately retaliated.

He struck his silver drum, instantly forming a silver-colored thunder dragon that met the fire dragon saber light.

Puh puh puh…

As these two dragons collided, they fiercely fought with each other, tearing at each other with dragon claws.

Under their frenzied battle,

lightning and flames surged, bursting out like fireworks.

In this dazzling fight,

a terrifying essence energy burst forth, sweeping towards the surroundings.

Under this battle’s aftermath,

the ground was scorched black and pitted by scattered flames.

Puh!

After a moment of frenzied battle,

the silver-colored thunder dragon was defeated and shattered into pieces in mid-air.

Tread tread tread…

With the silver-colored dragon shadow being defeated,

Lei Hong’s body was pushed back, his complexion turning pale.

“Too strong!”

Seeing this,

Lei Hong’s heart trembled and a sense of fear rose.

At this moment, he vaguely felt that he was not Mo Qingyun’s match and continuing the battle would be disadvantageous to him.

“Run!”

Thinking this,

Lei Hong’s face darkened and did not intend to continue fighting with Mo Qingyun, preparing to turn around and flee.

In his view,

keeping the mountain green would not worry about firewood. He could gather people and seek revenge another time.

Thinking this,

Lei Hong did not hesitate, turned around and fled without caring about the other people from the Thunder Kingdom.

Seeing Lei Hong’s actions,

Mo Qingyun showed a sneer and understood his intentions.

“This guy actually wants to escape from Boss’s hands; truly foolish.”

Seeing Lei Hong’s actions,

Ling Luo showed a mocking expression, knowing Mo Qingyun’s speed and agility very well.

Fierce Bird Break

Mo Qingyun moved, turning into a streak of light and chasing after Lei Hong.

In Mo Qingyun’s several flashes,

he instantly blocked Lei Hong’s path, blocking his way forward.

Blocking Lei Hong,

Mo Qingyun showed a mocking smile and said calmly, “In front of me, you can’t escape.”

“You… Don’t bully me too much!”

Seeing his path blocked,

Lei Hong’s face twitched and said with fear, “Kid, I warn you. I’m from the Thunder Kingdom; if you dare to harm me, the Thunder Kingdom won’t let you off. Also, your family.”

Hearing Lei Hong’s words,

Mo Qingyun’s face darkened and said coldly, “What I hate most is when others threaten me with my family; so, you die.”

Soul Heaven Seal

After speaking,

Mo Qingyun did not waste words with Lei Hong and summoned several soul battle seals, attacking him.

“Soul… Soul Attack!”

Seeing the soul battle seals approaching,

Lei Hong’s face changed and showed a look of shock, “Y… You’re…”

At this moment,

Lei Hong finally understood why his strongest abilities were ineffective against Mo Qingyun.

With the terrifying soul power Mo Qingyun displayed,

his soul beast abilities could hardly harm him.

Boom!

As Lei Hong was shocked,

several soul battle seals successively struck his mind.

Under these soul battle seals’ strikes,

Lei Hong was instantly dazed and showed a blank expression.

“Cut!”

Seeing Lei Hong’s current state,

Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and raised the Fire Silk Saber, slashing at him.

Puh!

With a slash,

the Fire Silk Saber pierced through Lei Hong’s body, leaving a terrifying wound.

After a moment,

Lei Hong regained his senses and saw the huge wound on his body, immediately widened his eyes in disbelief.

“No…”

Before Lei Hong could finish a word,

he widened his eyes and died from suffocation.

He did not expect Mo Qingyun to be so fearless towards the Thunder Kingdom and even dare to kill him.

Seeing Lei Hong die,

Mo Qingyun no longer paid attention to him and turned to look at the remaining people from the Thunder Kingdom, approaching them coldly, “Since Lei Hong is dead, you all go with him.”

“You… Don’t come over!”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words and seeing him approach,

the remaining people from the Thunder Kingdom showed fear.

Ignoring their pleas for mercy,

Mo Qingyun acted decisively.

His thought was that since they were already enemies, killing them all made no difference and it would be better to eliminate the threat.

“Haha, Thunder Kingdom, you have your day today.”

Seeing Lei Hong killed,

the remaining people from the Thunder Kingdom looked like sheep awaiting slaughter. Ling Luo showed a smug expression and ran towards Mo Qingyun, excitedly saying, “Boss, I’ll help you. These people are too many for you to handle alone.”

“This guy…”

Seeing Ling Luo’s smug expression,

Long Yutian shook his head helplessly and drank leisurely, not intending to act.

After a moment,

under Mo Qingyun’s and Ling Luo’s actions,

the remaining people from the Thunder Kingdom also met their end.

“Great, so great!”

After eliminating the Thunder Kingdom people,

Ling Luo showed a satisfied expression and said excitedly, “Too bad Lei Hao isn’t here; it would be even greater.”

Seeing Ling Luo’s actions,

Mo Qingyun and Long Yutian exchanged glances, both showing a helpless smile and shrugged.

Ling Luo’s actions were somewhat unorthodox but he was loyal enough to be worth befriending.

“Brothers, I heard that the true leader of the Thunder Kingdom, Lei Hao, is in Jiufang City not far away.”

Beside,

Long Yutian showed a faint smile and walked to Mo Qingyun and Ling Luo, suggesting, “You killed the Thunder Kingdom people; we should leave early.”

“Lei Hao coming is even better, I’ll finish them all off.”

Hearing Long Yutian mention Lei Hao,

Ling Luo showed a resentful expression and said with a raised head, “Boss, I’m just boasting; don’t take it seriously, heh.”

Hearing Ling Luo’s words,

Mo Qingyun and Long Yutian were speechless for a moment, then talked briefly before leaving Hongfen City.

Chapter 198 Long Yutian’s Frustration
