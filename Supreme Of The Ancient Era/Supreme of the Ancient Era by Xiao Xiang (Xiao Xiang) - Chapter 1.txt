In the Northern Mo Town, in a small courtyard of the Mo Family residence.

"I didn’t die; I, Gu Chi, am still alive, ha ha..."

In a slightly dilapidated little house, on the bed lay a young man, bursting into ecstatic laughter.

"Li He, Yang Yunfeng, Ye Feiyang, you all wait for me. The harm you brought to me, Gu Chi, I will return it a hundredfold."

Gu Chi was one of the nine supreme beings on the Heavenly Soul Continent, and also the youngest Dan Master in the land.

"Where is this...?"

After a brief moment of joy, Gu Chi looked around with some confusion.

He remembered that after obtaining the Nine-Dan Heaven Transformation Art in the Heavenly Spirit Tomb, he was ambushed by three supreme experts and fell into a death abyss.

As Gu Chi marveled at the scene before him, memories flooded his mind.

"Great Yan Dynasty, Xia Kingdom, Lianyun City, Northern Mo Town, Mo Family."

"The wastrel son of the Mo Family, a first-level illumination martial soul, a waste soul, fifteen years old, second-stage Body Refinement Realm."

"Insulting his fiancée and getting severely injured..."

...

These memories slowly sank into Gu Chi’s mind.

"Insulting his fiancée and getting severely injured?"

After a while, as he digested the memories in his mind, Gu Chi frowned and pondered.

According to the memories in his head, Mo Qingyun’s fiancée He Lingyu was the daughter of the patriarch of one of Northern Mo Town's three major families, the He Family. She possessed a seventh-level White Phoenix Soul and was at the sixth-stage Body Refinement Realm.

With her cultivation level and talent, could Mo Qingyun possibly have dared to insult her?

Thus, the hidden circumstances made one think deeply.

"Young man, it seems you died rather unjustly."

Gu Chi sighed inwardly and said solemnly, "Considering that I was reborn in your body, Gu Chi will owe you a favor. As repayment, I’ll take revenge for your grievances and make Mo Qingyun’s name resound across the Heavenly Soul Continent!"

"However, this first-level martial soul is indeed a trouble. Let’s see what kind of martial soul it is."

Mo Qingyun was somewhat troubled by the talent of this body.

A martial soul reflected a martial artist’s innate talent, and its level largely determined the martial artist's future achievements.

With a first-level martial soul, unless something unexpected happened, he would stop at the Body Refinement Realm for life.

Then, Mo Qingyun summoned his martial soul. Above his head appeared a red dragon shadow and a white light gate.

Dual-soul!

Mo Qingyun did not expect to possess two martial souls in this body.

Instantly, his heart was filled with joy.

On the Heavenly Soul Continent, there were countless martial artists, but those possessing dual souls were few and far between.

If no unexpected events occurred, those with dual souls would be rare gems.

This red dragon shadow soul was his previous life’s martial soul, the Thirteenth-Level Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon Blood Soul.

"Who would have thought that the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon soul would be reborn with me. Thus, my cultivation talent is no longer an issue."

Mo Qingyun glanced at the red dragon shadow soul before him and looked curiously at the white light gate soul, saying, "But what is this white light gate soul..."

After examining the white light gate soul for a while, even with his previous life’s experience, Mo Qingyun could not discern its origin.

"Well, the origins of this white light gate soul can be researched later. The urgent task is to improve my cultivation."

Mo Qingyun felt somewhat uncomfortable with his current Body Refinement Second Stage level and was eager to improve.

There were nine major cultivation realms in the martial path: Body Refinement Realm, True Qi Realm, True Essence Realm, Nascent Soul Realm, Dan Mansion Realm, Heaven Firmament Realm, Divine Skill Realm, Supreme Being Realm, and Dominator Realm.

"Having the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon soul, even without this white light gate soul, I can return to my previous life’s Supreme Being Realm. Moreover, after cultivating the Nine-Dan Heaven Transformation Art, my strength can advance further."

Mo Qingyun thought to himself.

"This body has missed the best time for cultivation. To quickly improve my cultivation, I need to rely on external forces." Mo Qingyun sensed his condition and smiled inwardly, thinking, "This won’t be difficult for me. I just need to prepare some Foundation Establishment Liquids and adjust my body."

In his previous life, Mo Qingyun was the youngest Dan Master on the Heavenly Soul Continent. Preparing some basic Foundation Establishment Liquids was quite simple for him.

...

In the Treasured Spirit Shop, the largest medicinal herb trading shop in Northern Mo Town. Not only were the prices reasonable, but the items were also complete.

After arriving in Northern Mo Town, Mo Qingyun headed straight for this place.

The Treasured Spirit Shop had three floors. The first floor sold ordinary herbs, the second floor sold spirit herbs, and the third floor sold spirit pills.

Spirit herbs and spirit pills were not needed by Mo Qingyun at present.

Of course, with his current financial situation, he could not afford them either.

Therefore, Mo Qingyun mainly selected items from the first floor.

The first floor of the Treasured Spirit Shop was spacious, about several hundred square feet, divided into four areas.

These were: Prescription and Charging Area, Display Area, Medicine Collection Area, and Decoction Area.

In the Prescription and Charging Area, they would write prescriptions for arriving guests or provide writing materials for them to write their own prescriptions and charge accordingly.

In the Display Area, all the herbs in the Treasured Spirit Shop were displayed for guests to see.

In the Medicine Collection Area, they would collect and hand over medicines based on prescriptions for guests.

Finally, in the Decoction Area, they would decoct the collected herbs into medicinal soup for guests who did not want to do it themselves.

After scanning through the first floor of the Treasured Spirit Shop, Mo Qingyun went to the Prescription Area and wrote down the herbs he needed.

Then, after paying for them, Mo Qingyun took his prescription to the Medicine Collection Area.

"This kid is too poor. He only bought enough herbs for one Foundation Establishment Liquid and ran out of money. Looks like he needs to find a way to earn some more."

Seeing that after buying the herbs for one Foundation Establishment Liquid, he only had a few gold coins left in his pocket, Mo Qingyun felt annoyed.

The Treasured Spirit Shop was efficient. Soon, the herbs were packed for Mo Qingyun.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun picked up his herbs and prepared to leave, heading back to the Mo Family.

"Hey, isn’t this our Mo Family’s genius, Young Master Qingyun?"

Just as Mo Qingyun was about to leave the Treasured Spirit Shop, a mocking voice came from outside.

Following this, Mo Qingyun saw several young men enter with disdainful looks, blocking his path.

Among them was a youth named Mo Hai, also a third-generation member of the Mo Family.

His talent was slightly better than Mo Qingyun’s, with a fourth-level Wind Wolf martial soul and Body Refinement Fourth Stage cultivation.

However, Mo Hai’s luck was better. He had a genius elder brother.

Mo Hai’s elder brother, Mo Cang, was the first genius of the Mo Family. He possessed a Tenth-Level Dark Tiger martial soul and had reached Body Refinement Ninth Stage at eighteen years old.

Mo Hai often bullied some of the other younger members of the Mo Family, including Mo Qingyun, relying on his elder brother’s influence.

According to the memories in his mind, Mo Qingyun knew that this Mo Hai had bullied him quite a bit.

Seeing Mo Hai blocking his path, Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened and said, "A good dog doesn’t block the way. Don’t you know that?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Mo Hai was taken aback and somewhat surprised by his behavior today.

Usually, when he saw him, Mo Qingyun would tremble in fear and submit to his bullying.

Today’s Mo Qingyun was somewhat unusual.

"Several days have passed, and your courage has grown. Dare you speak to me like this?"

After a brief moment of surprise, Mo Hai coldly looked at Mo Qingyun and sneered, "Do you think that because we can’t fight privately in the Treasured Spirit Shop, I can’t teach you a lesson?"

"Try it and see."

Regarding Mo Hai’s threat, Mo Qingyun was unconcerned and said indifferently, "You can try."

Although he no longer had the Supreme Being Realm cultivation, with his previous life’s experience and expertise, there were many ways to deal with a Body Refinement Fourth Stage Mo Hai.

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s current demeanor, Mo Hai did not rush to attack but smiled faintly and said, "No need to hurry. In three days, there will be the monthly trial in our clan. Then I’ll teach you a lesson."

Hearing Mo Hai’s words, Mo Qingyun did not respond and looked at him with a hint of amusement before leaving the Treasured Spirit Shop.

...

In Mo Qingyun’s residence.

Mo Qingyun took out the herbs he bought from the Treasured Spirit Shop one by one and neatly arranged them beside him.

Then, after searching around his residence, he found a porcelain jar.

"Currently, the conditions are limited. I can only make do with this porcelain jar."

Looking at the porcelain jar before him, Mo Qingyun sighed and said, "This kid is really poor. There’s not even a decent thing in his home. Is this kid truly a direct descendant of the Mo Family?"

"It seems I have to rely on myself for everything."

Mo Qingyun sighed again.

After a sigh, Mo Qingyun placed the porcelain jar on the stove and began to brew the Foundation Establishment Liquid.

As time passed, Mo Qingyun sequentially placed the herbs he bought from the Treasured Spirit Shop into the porcelain jar.

After several hours, a medicinal aroma came from the jar, indicating that the herbs were ready.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun took the porcelain jar off the stove and poured the brewed Foundation Establishment Liquid into a bucket filled with water.

As soon as the Foundation Establishment Liquid was poured in, the originally clear water turned green.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun hesitated no longer and jumped into the bucket to begin his cultivation.

At the Body Refinement Realm, one mainly strengthened their body. Therefore, Mo Qingyun chose to cultivate through a medicinal bath.

This way, the absorption was better and faster.

As soon as he entered the bucket, Mo Qingyun felt a warm current circling around his body, massaging him.

After several hours,

Under Mo Qingyun’s cultivation, the water in the bucket returned to its clear state.

"Body Refinement Third Stage."

At this moment, Mo Qingyun opened his eyes and showed a hint of joy.

"Unfortunately, the Foundation Establishment Liquid is gone. Otherwise, in three days, my cultivation should reach Body Refinement Fourth Stage."

Thinking of this, Mo Qingyun felt somewhat helpless and sighed inwardly, "I need to find a way to earn money to buy herbs and spirit herbs for cultivation. Without them, the progress of my cultivation will be much slower."

"Right, this month’s monthly allowance of a thousand gold coins hasn’t been collected yet."

Mo Qingyun thought and headed towards the Mo Family’s accounting office.

The Mo Family provided a monthly allowance to their younger members for cultivation needs.

Ordinary family members could receive one hundred gold coins per month, while direct descendants received a thousand gold coins.

As a direct descendant of the Mo Family, Mo Qingyun had a monthly allowance of a thousand gold coins.

For him now, this was quite a sum of money.

With the help of these thousand gold coins, Mo Qingyun had confidence to reach Body Refinement Fourth Stage within three days.

The accounting office was not far from Mo Qingyun’s residence, located between the inner and outer clans of the Mo Family.

A few minutes later, Mo Qingyun arrived at the accounting office.

"Quickly look, it’s that wastrel Mo Qingyun. Guess how much monthly allowance he can get this time."

"He’ll probably get nothing and be beaten up again."

"The possibility of being beaten is not high, but his monthly allowance will definitely be deducted. Hu Manager is famous for deducting allowances."

"Shh! Speak softly, Hu Manager is the elder brother of Seventh Elder’s concubine. We can’t comment on him."

...

Seeing Mo Qingyun approach, the younger members of the Mo Family in the accounting office whispered and gloated.

Unaware of others’ thoughts, Mo Qingyun walked into the accounting office directly.

"Manager, I’m here to collect my monthly allowance."

Mo Qingyun walked up to Hu Manager and said calmly.

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Hu Manager glanced at him disdainfully and took out ten gold coins, tossing them in front of Mo Qingyun.

"Ten gold coins?"

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun frowned and looked surprised.

As a direct descendant of the Mo Family, he should receive one thousand gold coins monthly.

Now Hu Manager was only giving him ten gold coins, which was quite excessive.

Mo Qingyun’s tone turned cold and said, "Manager Hu, isn’t my monthly allowance amount incorrect?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Hu Manager raised an eyebrow and glanced at him disdainfully, saying, "Think it’s too little?"

Then he picked up the ten gold coins from in front of Mo Qingyun and said unhappily, "You’ve used up your allowance this month. Now you can leave."

"Used up?"

Seeing Hu Manager’s actions, Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened and he shouted, "Manager Hu, how dare you privately deduct the monthly allowance of a family member. Do you know what punishment awaits you?"

"Did I hear him right? This wastrel actually scolded Manager Hu?"

"The last person who offended Manager Hu had both legs broken. This wastrel is in trouble."

...

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s actions, the surrounding people were shocked and almost couldn’t believe their ears.

Mo Qingyun actually scolded Manager Hu. Was he crazy?

"Scolding me? Looks like I’ve been too kind, allowing this wastrel to speak to me like this."

Hu Manager glanced at Mo Qingyun disdainfully and said with a cold smile, "Now kneel down and apologize to me by hitting your own face one hundred times. Then leave the accounting office, never to appear in my sight again."

"Kneel and apologize? Hit your own face?"

Hearing Hu Manager’s words, Mo Qingyun narrowed his eyes and looked at him coldly, saying, "I’ll give you a chance. Kneel down and apologize to me by hitting your own face one thousand times, then go to the Law Enforcement Hall to admit your mistake. I’ll spare you."

"You’re looking for death."

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Hu Manager became furious and raised his hand to strike him.

Although Hu Manager was the manager of the accounting office, his strength wasn’t strong. He was only at Body Refinement Fourth Stage.

Moreover, his martial soul was ordinary, a third-level Mountain Gazelle Soul.

However, this was enough to deal with the previous Mo Qingyun.

Mo Qingyun was doomed.

Seeing Hu Manager attack, the surrounding younger members looked at Mo Qingyun with sympathy.

With his Body Refinement Second Stage cultivation and a first-level waste martial soul, Mo Qingyun was no match for Hu Manager.

If he got hit by Hu Manager’s palm, he might be bedridden for months.

Bang!

When everyone thought Mo Qingyun would be struck and severely injured by Hu Manager’s palm,

They saw Hu Manager’s large body being kicked away by Mo Qingyun.

With his previous life’s Supreme Being Realm experience, it was very simple for Mo Qingyun to counter Hu Manager’s attack.

After kicking Hu Manager away, Mo Qingyun did not stop but attacked him again with a series of kicks.

"Ahhh..."

Under Mo Qingyun’s relentless kicks, Hu Manager let out pig-like screams and his face swelled up like a pig’s head.

Seeing this, the surrounding people were dumbfounded.

"Am I seeing things? Mo Qingyun is beating Manager Hu."

"Manager Hu has Body Refinement Fourth Stage strength and a third-level Mountain Gazelle Soul. How can Mo Qingyun beat him?"

...

This scene was unbelievable to them, with Hu Manager being beaten.

Was Manager Hu really at Body Refinement Fourth Stage?

When did Body Refinement Fourth Stage become so weak, being beaten by a first-level waste at Body Refinement Second Stage?

Moreover, Hu Manager’s entire defeat happened in one move.

In just one move, Body Refinement Fourth Stage Manager Hu was defeated. When did Mo Qingyun become so powerful?

Everyone’s minds were in chaos at this moment.

...

"Little brat, you dared to attack a family manager. You’ll be punished by the clan rules."

After being kicked by Mo Qingyun, Hu Manager’s expression turned狰狞 and he shouted angrily.

"Manager? Clan punishment?"

Hearing Hu Manager’s words, Mo Qingyun smiled and said, "You think too highly of yourself. You’re just a slave, a dog in the Mo Family. The master hitting his dog won’t be punished."

As he spoke, the actions of his feet intensified.

By chance or design, Mo Qingyun’s kick landed on Hu Manager’s crotch.

"Oh..."

Under Mo Qingyun’s kick, Hu Manager curled up like a shrimp and pleaded, "Young Master Qingyun, no, Young Ancestor Qingyun, I was wrong. I’ll give you all your monthly allowance without deduction. Please stop hitting me."

"Will I still be punished by the clan rules?" Mo Qingyun asked with a playful smile.

"No... No, I won’t mention this. I’m just a slave and a dog in the Mo Family. The master hitting his dog is normal." Hu Manager said with a series of apologetic smiles.

"You’re smart."

Seeing Hu Manager’s submission, Mo Qingyun kicked him a couple more times and smiled contentedly before stopping.

Then Hu Manager handed all of Mo Qingyun’s monthly allowance without deduction to him.

Looking at Mo Qingyun, Hu Manager now had a hint of awe in his eyes.

But if observed closely, one could still see a trace of resentment.

However, Mo Qingyun did not pay much attention to this.

With these monthly allowances, his strength could advance further. At that time, Hu Manager would be no threat.

"Having these monthly allowances, reaching Body Refinement Fourth Stage should be possible."

Looking at the amount of his monthly allowance in his hand, Mo Qingyun smiled contentedly and left the accounting office.

"Little brat, I won’t let this go. Next time, I’ll make sure you don’t get the upper hand."

Seeing Mo Qingyun gradually walk away, Hu Manager mustered his courage and shouted at his back.

"Get the upper hand?"

Hearing Hu Manager’s words, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and did not pay attention to him.

Was he really taking the upper hand?

Perhaps only Hu Manager knew best in his heart.

A moment later, as Mo Qingyun walked away, the accounting office suddenly became agitated.

"Am I seeing things? Mo Qingyun just beat Manager Hu and got all his monthly allowance."

"How did Mo Qingyun become so powerful? He’s not even Manager Hu’s match."

"Is this still the wastrel Mo Qingyun?"

...

After Mo Qingyun walked away, the younger members in the accounting office were still agitated.

Leaving the accounting office, Mo Qingyun did not return to his residence but went straight to the Treasured Spirit Shop.

"Only three days until the clan monthly trial. Are you all prepared?"

"We’re ready. I heard that this month’s trial has been reformed, and the top ten will receive rewards from the clan."

"I heard that ordinary members and elites are separated in the trial, and the first place gets ten thousand gold coins."

...

As Mo Qingyun walked out of the Mo Family, some younger members’ conversations reached his ears.

"Rewards? Ten thousand gold coins?"

Hearing the words of those around him, Mo Qingyun’s eyes lit up and he felt a bit of anticipation for the monthly trial.

Previously, Mo Hai said that he would teach him a lesson in the monthly trial. He did not pay much attention to it.

Now, winning first place in the monthly trial would give him ten thousand gold coins as a reward.

He couldn’t miss this opportunity.

"I must win first place in the monthly trial."

Mo Qingyun clenched his fists and made a decision inwardly.

Now, he was most in need of money. If he could win first place and get ten thousand gold coins as a reward,

He could buy herbs and spirit herbs to assist his cultivation, perhaps advancing his strength all the way to Body Refinement Sixth Stage.

"Manager Hu is only at Body Refinement Fourth Stage. During the fight, he neither summoned his martial soul nor used any martial techniques. His strength wasn’t strong. The opponents in the monthly trial should be stronger."

Mo Qingyun thought inwardly about the strength of his opponents in the monthly trial: "Moreover, Mo Hai’s elder brother is the first genius of the Mo Family. He should give some trump cards to Mo Hai, which I need to pay attention to."

Although Mo Qingyun was confident in his strength, he would not be careless.

This monthly trial was very important to him now. He did not want any mishaps.

A moment later, Mo Qingyun arrived at the Treasured Spirit Shop.

Entering the Treasured Spirit Shop, he wrote down his prescription as usual and paid for it before collecting the herbs.

After getting three Foundation Establishment Liquids, his pocket was empty again. Mo Qingyun sighed inwardly, "I’m poor again. Money doesn’t last long."

"I must win first place in the monthly trial."

Mo Qingyun made up his mind again, determined to get first place.

After a while, seeing the three Foundation Establishment Liquids ready, Mo Qingyun left without delay.

Taking the herbs from the clerk, he walked towards the exit of the Treasured Spirit Shop.

However, as Mo Qingyun was about to leave the Treasured Spirit Shop, a commotion outside caught his attention.

A young man and a girl were walking towards the Treasured Spirit Shop, surrounded by several boys like stars around the moon.

Seeing these two people, a violent rage rose in Mo Qingyun’s heart without reason.

The girl was none other than his fiancée He Lingyu, now standing closely with someone else.

As for the young man beside her, he was the one who accused Mo Qingyun of insulting He Lingyu and severely injured him.

Now that these two stood together, their affair was evident.

However, the young man’s identity was not ordinary. He was Song Zihao, the first genius of one of Northern Mo Town’s three major families, the Song Family.

Song Zihao possessed a Tenth-Level Red Thunder Frog martial soul and had reached Body Refinement Ninth Stage, far surpassing Mo Qingyun’s current state.

"You wastrel, you dared to do such despicable things to Miss Lingyu. How dare you show your face in public."

Song Zihao glanced at Mo Qingyun with a cold gaze and said, "Now kneel down and apologize to Miss Lingyu by hitting your own face. Then sever one of your arms, and I won’t trouble you further."

"Hit my own face? Sever an arm?"

Hearing Song Zihao’s words, Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened and he looked at him coldly with a hint of killing intent.

Song Zihao not only killed his previous self but also wanted to humiliate him in front of He Lingyu. This was something Mo Qingyun could not accept.

"From now on, stay away from He Lingyu. Otherwise, I’ll exterminate your Song Family one day." Mo Qingyun said arrogantly.

"Looking for death!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Song Zihao became furious and raised his hand to strike him.

Mo Qingyun did not expect that Song Zihao would attack so decisively.

With his Body Refinement Ninth Stage cultivation, even if he was a reborn Supreme Being, it would be somewhat troublesome to deal with him.

However, since Song Zihao was not at the True Qi Realm, although it would be troublesome to deal with him, he could still handle him.

Seeing Song Zihao’s palm coming towards him, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate and quickly dodged to the side.

At that moment, a blue figure appeared in front of him as he dodged Song Zihao’s attack.

Bang!

A muffled sound was heard, and both Song Zihao and the blue figure staggered back.

"Song Zihao, we Mo Family people are not for you to bully."

The blue figure blocked Song Zihao’s attack and looked at him coldly, lifting his chin.

"Mo Xin, don’t meddle in others’ affairs. You’re causing trouble for yourself because of a wastrel."

Recognizing the blue figure, Song Zihao’s expression darkened and said coldly.

Mo Xin was also a genius among the younger members of the Mo Family, possessing a Ninth-Level Flame Sparrow martial soul and reaching Body Refinement Tenth Stage.

"If I choose to meddle?"

Mo Xin said indifferently.

"Everyone, no private fights are allowed in the Treasured Spirit Shop. Please cooperate."

At this moment, an old man walked out from inside the Treasured Spirit Shop.

"Yes, Manager You!"

Hearing the old man’s words, Song Zihao and his group nodded.

They were somewhat wary of this Manager You. He was one of the few experts in Northern Mo Town, a High-Rank True Essence Realm powerhouse.

Seeing their response, Manager You nodded satisfactorily and walked back into the Treasured Spirit Shop.

"Mo Xin, I’ll remember this. Next year at the Town Meeting Day, I’ll get my revenge."

After Manager You left, Song Zihao threw a threat and then led He Lingyu and the others away.

...

"Thank you, Mo Xin."

After Song Zihao and his group left, Mo Qingyun bowed slightly to thank Mo Xin.

In the Mo Family, not many people truly cared about Mo Qingyun. Mo Xin was one of them.

"Stinky kid, why are you being polite to me?"

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s gesture, Mo Xin puffed out her chest and scolded him playfully before saying, "But you really have some guts to talk to Song Zihao like that. This guy is someone even I need to be wary of."

"You’ve made him angry, so you’ll have to be careful in the future." Mo Xin said with concern.

"Mm-hmm, I’ll be more careful."

Mo Qingyun smiled faintly in response to Mo Xin’s concern and asked, "Sister Mo Xin, did you come here for spirit herbs?"

...

Mo Xin replied with a wave of her hand, "I came specially to find you. I went to your residence earlier but didn’t see you there, so I heard that you were here at the Treasured Spirit Shop and came over."

Mo Qingyun asked, "Sister Mo Xin, did you come for something?"

"Can’t I just come to see you?"

Mo Xin rolled her eyes at Mo Qingyun and handed him a jade bottle, saying, "Here, this is from Uncle Si."

"From Uncle Si?"

Mo Qingyun’s expression changed as he took the jade bottle from Mo Xin and opened it.

Inside was a milky white liquid, crystal clear.

Seeing the milky white liquid in the jade bottle, Mo Qingyun’s expression changed and a hint of joy rose in his heart.

This was Lapis Lazuli Stone Milk, which had the effect of washing away impurities and strengthening the body at the Body Refinement Realm.

"Uncle Si, so partial. He even gave you Lapis Lazuli Stone Milk."

Seeing the milky white liquid in the jade bottle, Mo Xin pursed her lips and blinked, saying enviously.

"Sister Mo Xin, this Lapis Lazuli Stone Milk is also useful to you. Do you want half of it?"

Seeing Mo Xin’s expression, Mo Qingyun paused and said.

But when she heard his words, Mo Xin smiled sweetly and said, "No need. I’m already at Body Refinement Tenth Stage now, so the effect of this Lapis Lazuli Stone Milk is minimal. Besides, Uncle Si gave me this."

Saying that, Mo Xin took out another jade bottle and opened it to show Mo Qingyun.

"Qi Gathering Pill!"

Seeing the pill in Mo Xin’s jade bottle, Mo Qingyun’s expression changed and he sighed inwardly, "Uncle Si, you’re really generous."

Qi Gathering Pill could increase a Body Refinement Realm martial artist’s chances of breaking through to the True Qi Realm by fifty percent, without any side effects.

Compared to Lapis Lazuli Stone Milk, the value of Qi Gathering Pill was not inferior at all.

"Let’s go back, Sister Mo Xin."

Seeing that there were no more matters to attend to, Mo Qingyun said to Mo Xin.

"Okay."

Mo Xin nodded and curiously looked at the herbs in Mo Qingyun’s hand, asking, "Qingyun, what medicine is this?"

"Foundation Establishment Liquid. It can strengthen the body and speed up Body Refinement Realm cultivation progress." Mo Qingyun replied honestly.

"Foundation Establishment Liquid?"

Mo Xin’s expression changed, and a look of confusion appeared in her eyes as she asked, "I’ve never heard of it. Where did you learn about it?"

Seeing Mo Xin’s expression, Mo Qingyun chuckled and said, "It’s normal that you haven’t heard of it. Because I made it myself."

"You made it yourself?"

Mo Xin was surprised, examining Mo Qingyun as if she had discovered a new world.

She never imagined that the Foundation Establishment Liquid in Mo Qingyun’s hand was something he made himself.

"Sister Mo Xin, do you want a portion?"

Ignoring Mo Xin’s surprise, Mo Qingyun pointed at the herbs in his hand and asked.

"No... No need. I want to live a few more years."

Mo Xin shook her head and waved her hand, saying, "I advise you to be careful with this Foundation Establishment Liquid. Uncle San only has one son, and he’s you. Don’t risk anything."

"I’ll be careful."

Seeing Mo Xin misunderstand his intention and not want to accept the Foundation Establishment Liquid, Mo Qingyun did not explain further.

Could he tell her that he was a reborn Supreme Being and the youngest Dan Master on the Heavenly Soul Continent in his previous life?

After that, Mo Qingyun returned to the Mo Family with Mo Xin.

...

Returning to his residence, Mo Qingyun took out the herbs he bought from the Treasured Spirit Shop and began to brew Foundation Establishment Liquid.

About an hour later, the Foundation Establishment Liquid was ready.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun poured it into a bucket and jumped in to absorb the Foundation Establishment Liquid for cultivation.

The next day, as the sun rose slowly,

Mo Qingyun absorbed all the Foundation Establishment Liquid in the bucket.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun opened his eyes and showed a look of joy.

After absorbing the third batch of Foundation Establishment Liquid from the Treasured Spirit Shop, Mo Qingyun’s cultivation finally reached Body Refinement Fourth Stage.

"Body Refinement Fourth Stage!"

Seeing his cultivation breakthrough, Mo Qingyun smiled and said, "Now I’ll have more confidence in the monthly trial."

"The Foundation Establishment Liquid is all used up. Further improvement of cultivation is impossible, but I can refine the Lapis Lazuli Stone Milk."

Thinking this, Mo Qingyun took out the Lapis Lazuli Stone Milk and swallowed it, beginning to refine it.

As soon as the Lapis Lazuli Stone Milk entered his stomach, it turned into a stream of clear water flowing through Mo Qingyun’s meridians, giving off a cool sensation.

As the Lapis Lazuli Stone Milk was refined, Mo Qingyun felt his body constantly experiencing a tingling sensation.

He knew this was the effect of the Lapis Lazuli Stone Milk.

While feeling this tingling sensation, Mo Qingyun could also sense his body gradually strengthening.

Several hours later,

The tingling sensation finally subsided, and Mo Qingyun stopped refining. He knew the Lapis Lazuli Stone Milk had been completely refined.

At the same time, Mo Qingyun saw black impurities flowing out from his pores and skin surface.

These were the impurities expelled after strengthening his body with Lapis Lazuli Stone Milk.
