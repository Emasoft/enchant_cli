Seeing Mo Qingyun pass the soul crystal jade, Chi Lian immediately showed an excited expression and joyfully reached out to receive it.

The soul crystal jade, this is a good thing. With these soul crystal jades, his soul power will immediately increase significantly.

After receiving the soul crystal jade, Chi Lian did not act pretentiously and began to refine it directly.

With his intelligence, he naturally understood Mo Qingyun's intentions.

Mo Qingyun had him refine the soul crystal jade to enhance his soul power, so he could better exert his ability to subdue blood slaves.

Thus, during the journey ahead, Mo Qingyun and the others divided their tasks clearly.

Yue Ying was responsible for driving the carriage, while Chi Lian and Mo Qingyun refined the soul crystal jade to enhance their own soul power.

Five days later, Mo Qingyun and his companions finally returned to Lian Yun City.

At this moment, both Mo Qingyun's and Chi Lian's soul cultivation had significantly improved.

Mo Qingyun’s current soul cultivation had successfully broken through to the late-stage Soul Form Realm, while Chi Lian's soul cultivation had also entered the early-stage Soul Form Realm.

Upon seeing Mo Qingyun arrive, the guards at the city gates immediately showed a reverent expression and gave him and his companions a salute before letting them pass.

Entering Lian Yun City, Mo Qingyun directly headed back to Jadeite Mansion with a sense of urgency.

It had been two months since he left Jadeite Mansion, and he wondered how things were going there.

"Master Qingyun, you're back."

Moments later, the guards at Jadeite Mansion's entrance saw Mo Qingyun return and reported with great joy to those inside.

Then, Mo Hongtian and the others all showed a delighted expression as they came out to welcome him.

Seeing Mo Hongtian and the others come out, knowing everyone was well, Mo Qingyun put his mind at ease and walked towards them with a faint smile.

As he approached, Mo Qingyun noticed that the strength of the Mo family and others had made considerable progress during this period.

He was very pleased with such results, his smile growing even more.

After walking up to Mo Hongtian and the others, Mo Qingyun asked them: "Grandfather, is everything well at the mansion? Have the Xue family come to cause trouble?"

"Everything is fine. Now, Jadeite Mansion has everything running smoothly."

Thinking about the current situation of the Mo family, Mo Hongtian smiled with satisfaction and said: "Although the Xue family often causes trouble, due to the City Lord Mansion and Alchemy Guild's intervention, they haven't dared to cause too much trouble."

"Xue family!"

Hearing Mo Hongtian's words, Mo Qingyun’s expression turned slightly cold and he thought to himself: "I hope you can behave properly. Otherwise, I don't mind wiping you out."

"Oh, right. A few days ago, Young Lord Yue Xuan from the City Lord Mansion came and asked when you would return."

Mo Hongtian's expression changed, showing a serious look: "From the way Yue Xuan Young Lord looked, it seems he has something urgent to find you. He instructed us that as soon as you return, please go to the City Lord Mansion."

"Oh!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, his expression changed slightly, somewhat surprised by Yue Xuan’s arrival. However, he soon understood the reason.

It had been about two months since he helped Wan Lianyun extract poison, and Yue Xuan’s arrival was likely for this matter.

"Since that's the case, I'll go to the City Lord Mansion first."

Thinking about Wan Lianyun’s poison, Mo Qingyun decided not to hesitate and said to Mo Hongtian and the others: "Grandfather, I'll go to the City Lord Mansion first and then return."

"Alright!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Mo Hongtian nodded. At the same time, he curiously looked at Yue Ying beside him and asked: "Qingyun, who is this?"

"This is Yue Ying, a disciple Chi Lian just took on."

On the way, Mo Qingyun had learned that Chi Lian saw Yue Ying’s talent and took him as a nominal disciple.

Mo Qingyun didn’t mind Chi Lian's decision, it wasn't bad for him to do so.

Yue Ying’s talent was quite good; with proper cultivation, he would have a place to shine in the future.

As for Yue Ying’s reaction to Chi Lian taking him as a nominal disciple, he was excited for quite some time. In his eyes, Chi Lian was a formidable person with extraordinary abilities.

"Yue Ying young friend, it's an honor to meet you."

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s introduction, Mo Hongtian greeted Yue Ying politely.

When Yue Ying entered, he sensed that his aura was astonishing. Therefore, he didn’t dare to be casual.

Hearing Mo Hongtian’s attitude, Yue Ying was immediately flattered and waved his hands repeatedly: "Old Master, you are too courteous. I can’t bear this honor."

There was no way he could accept Mo Hongtian’s courtesy, as he had originally been Chi Lian's blood slave and Chi Lian was Mo Qingyun’s servant.

"Yue Ying, stay at Jadeite Mansion for now. Chi Lian and I will go out."

Mo Qingyun instructed Yue Ying, then accompanied Chi Lian to the City Lord Mansion.

At this moment, as Mo Qingyun just left Jadeite Mansion,

A group of people arrived outside Jadeite Mansion, each with a haughty and arrogant expression.

These were none other than the Xue family people.

"Xue family?"

Seeing these people arrive, Mo Qingyun’s lips curled up with a playful smile.

"Hey! Mo family people, you are quite self-aware to come out and welcome us."

Seeing Mo Qingyun and the others leave Jadeite Mansion, the young man at the forefront of the Xue family looked disdainfully at Mo Qingyun and the others.

"How is it? Have you thought about it?"

This young man swept his gaze over Mo family and the others, then said: "I give you one last chance. If you don’t hand over Mo Qingyun that brat, even with the Alchemy Guild and City Lord Mansion’s protection, our Xue family will definitely wipe out your Mo family."

"Wipe out the Mo family?"

Hearing this young man’s words, Mo Qingyun's expression darkened and he narrowed his eyes to look at him.

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s expression, the nearby Mo Hongtian was immediately alarmed and hurriedly said to him: "Qingyun, don’t act impulsively. He is Xue Yunjie, the son of the Xue family’s patriarch."

"Youngster, so you are Mo Qingyun!"

As Mo Hongtian consoled him, Xue Yunjie learned Mo Qingyun’s identity and coldly said with some surprise: "You finally dared to come out. I thought you would be a turtle in a shell for life. Since you came out, it’s best if you kneel and apologize to me now, then commit suicide in front of me. I might consider sparing your Mo family."

"Be a turtle in a shell? Spare our Mo family?"

Hearing Xue Yunjie’s words, Mo Qingyun narrowed his eyes even more and his mocking smile grew.

"I also tell you that even if you kneel and apologize to me now, I won’t spare your Xue family."

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Xue Yunjie’s expression immediately darkened and he coldly said: "Foolish brat, since you want to take the entire Mo family with you as your tomb, I will fulfill your wish. Order my men to kill these country bumpkins and hang their bodies on the city walls."

"Yes, Young Master Yunjie."

Hearing Xue Yunjie’s words, his guards immediately charged towards Mo Qingyun and the others.

"Halt!"

Seeing Xue family’s guards’ actions, the City Lord Mansion’s guards who had been standing by immediately stepped forward to block their movements.

Seeing the City Lord Mansion’s guards appear, Xue family’s attacking guards had to无奈ly stop.

Xue Yunjie seemed to have anticipated the City Lord Mansion’s guards’ appearance and showed no surprise.

Taking out a plaque, he threw it in front of Mo family and the others and coldly said: "Worthless cowards who rely on others for protection, I think your Mo family should change this plaque."

Clang!

The plaque landed with a crisp sound, inscribed with four large characters: "Turtle Mo Family."

Seeing the plaque on the ground, Mo Qingyun’s mocking smile grew even more and he replied: "Good, your Xue family did well. You gave me many ways to deal with you."

"Deal with our Xue family? Youngster, are you a fool? With your Mo family, do you think you can deal with our Xue family?"

Xue Yunjie looked at Mo Qingyun disdainfully and replied: "If it weren’t for the City Lord Mansion’s people here, I would have wiped out your Mo family and hung their bodies on the city walls."

"Wipe out our Mo family, hang their bodies on the city walls?"

Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened and he coldly glanced at Xue family and the others, then said to the City Lord Mansion’s guards: "You don’t need to intervene in what follows, let us handle it ourselves."

"Dan Young Master, the City Lord instructed that..."

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, these guards were somewhat at a loss.

"Don’t worry, I will explain to City Lord Wan later."

Seeing the guard’s expression, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and waved his hand to reassure him.

"However..."

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, this guard wanted to persuade him further but seeing his determined expression, he chose to watch from the side.

He thought of letting Mo Qingyun handle it first and if not, he would intervene later.

Seeing Mo Qingyun ask the City Lord Mansion’s people to stay out of it, Xue Yunjie immediately showed a smug smile and said: "Youngster, I admire your courage to throw off the City Lord Mansion’s protection. But soon you will know how foolish this decision is."

"Is that so?" Mo Qingyun smiled playfully and coldly swept his gaze over Xue family and the others, as if looking at dead people.

"Attack, wipe out the Mo family."

Xue Yunjie waved his hand behind him and ordered them to attack.

"Yes, Young Master Yunjie."

Hearing Xue Yunjie’s command, the guards immediately responded and charged towards Mo family and the others.

As these guards rushed towards Mo family and the others, an old man who had not spoken before slowly walked forward with a disdainful look.

"I know your Mo family has someone at the Nascent Soul Realm. Let him come out."

As this old man spoke, a terrifying aura emanated from his body.

Nascent Soul Realm Second Stage!

This old man’s cultivation was at the Nascent Soul Realm Second Stage.

Feeling this old man’s aura, Mo Hongtian and the others immediately paled with shock.

A Nascent Soul Realm Second Stage powerhouse! Such a person could easily wipe out the Mo family with a flip of his hand.

At this moment, while the Mo family was worried in their hearts, Chi Lian snorted and walked out with disdain.

"Humph! A Nascent Soul Realm Second Stage dare to be so arrogant. Let this old man refine you."

As Chi Lian spoke, he released his aura without reservation.

With Chi Lian’s aura out, everyone’s expressions changed. His aura was even stronger than the Xue family old man.

This meant Chi Lian’s cultivation might have reached Nascent Soul Realm Third Stage.

"Mo family’s red-haired old man is actually a Nascent Soul Realm Third Stage powerhouse!"

Everyone was shocked, suddenly realizing they had underestimated the Mo family.

As Chi Lian released his aura, Yue Ying also attacked Xue family’s guards with unrestrained Nascent Soul Realm power.

Nascent Soul Realm! Another Nascent Soul Realm powerhouse!

The Mo family had another Nascent Soul Realm powerhouse, and the once insignificant Mo family now had two.

At this moment, everyone took the Mo family seriously. With their current strength displayed, the Mo family could rank among the top hundred in Lian Yun City.

"Good, good, good!"

Knowing Chi Lian and Yue Ying’s true cultivation, Mo Hongtian and the others were overjoyed and cheered repeatedly.

They never imagined that Mo Qingyun had brought back two Nascent Soul Realm powerhouses at once.

With Chi Lian and Yue Ying, the Xue family would have to think twice before moving against the Mo family.

From now on, anyone who wanted to move against the Mo family would have to think carefully.

"Two Nascent Soul Realm powerhouses!"

Seeing Chi Lian and Yue Ying, Xue Yunjie’s expression turned pale with some panic.

He never imagined this situation in his dreams.

At this moment, as Xue Yunjie was worried, Mo Qingyun moved and rushed towards the guards.

Gravity Suppression!

After arriving at the guards’ side, Mo Qingyun directly unleashed Earth’s Essence to suppress the Xue family guards’ actions and assist Yue Ying in killing them.

Although Mo Qingyun’s cultivation was still low, his Gravity Suppression greatly affected the Xue family guards’ actions.

"What’s going on? Why do I feel like there is a few hundred pounds of weight pressing down on me."

Feeling the Gravity Suppression, Xue family’s guards showed panic.

"Earth’s Essence!"

At this moment, as these guards were panicked, Chi Lian and the others’ expressions changed with shock.

Mo Qingyun had actually comprehended Earth’s Essence. This meant he had comprehended two Essences.

Mo Qingyun, at the True Qi Realm, comprehending two Essences. This comprehension ability was too extraordinary.

"Good, good, good young man!"

Knowing Mo Qingyun had comprehended two Essences, Mo Hongtian’s old face was excited with tears in his eyes.

Having such a son, what more could the Mo family ask for!

It was laughable that Mo Kuide and others thought Mo Qingyun’s talent was inferior to Mo Cang. They were shortsighted.

"This young man’s future achievements are limitless!"

Second Elder Mo Kuixin was also excited and sighed with admiration.

At this moment, as everyone was shocked by Mo Qingyun’s comprehension of two Essences, Chi Lian struck the Xue family old man he was fighting and sent him flying.

Puh!

After landing, the Xue family old man spat blood and his aura weakened. He seemed to be seriously injured.

Crack!

But Chi Lian did not soften his blow, reaching out and snapping the Xue family old man’s neck.

The Xue family’s Nascent Soul Realm Second Stage powerhouse died!

Sss!

Seeing Chi Lian’s decisive actions, everyone involuntarily paled and drew in a breath.

Mo family’s red-haired old man was so ruthless!

At this moment, Chi Lian left a terrifying impression in everyone’s hearts.

Ignoring the reactions around him, after killing the Xue family old man, Chi Lian rushed towards the Xue family guards.

Bang bang bang...

Facing Chi Lian’s attack, these True Qi Realm guards were like chickens and dogs, being crushed to death.

In an instant, the Xue family’s guards were all killed by Chi Lian.

Seeing his clan elder and guards, who came with him, being slaughtered in a few breaths of time,

Xue Yunjie’s face turned pale and his body trembled, looking ashen.

He was scared!

He never imagined that the Mo family, whom he saw as ants, had such terrifying existence.

With fear rising in his heart, Xue Yunjie did not dare to linger and turned to flee.

Seeing Xue Yunjie wanting to escape, Mo Qingyun showed a mocking smile and said disdainfully: "Now you know to run. Do you think you can escape?"

Darting Steps

As Mo Qingyun spoke, he moved and appeared in front of Xue Yunjie, blocking his path.

"You... what do you want?"

Seeing his path blocked by Mo Qingyun, Xue Yunjie showed fear and said nervously.

"What do you want?"

Looking at the nervous Xue Yunjie, Mo Qingyun glanced at him disdainfully and kicked towards him.

Xue Yunjie was only at the True Qi Realm Third Stage. Facing Mo Qingyun’s attack, he had no resistance and was kicked flying by Mo Qingyun.

Bang!

With Mo Qingyun’s kick, Xue Yunjie was kicked flying and fell heavily to the ground, raising a cloud of dust.

Cough!

After falling, Xue Yunjie spat blood and looked at Mo Qingyun with a terrified expression.

"You... don’t come over."

Seeing Mo Qingyun approaching, Xue Yunjie nervously said, moving backward.

"Are you afraid?"

Mo Qingyun smiled playfully and looked at Xue Yunjie with a cold light in his eyes.

"I..."

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s cold gaze, Xue Yunjie shivered and said fearfully: "You... you can’t touch me. I am the Xue family’s young master, if you dare to touch me, the Xue family won’t let your Mo family off."

"Xue family’s young master?"

Hearing Xue Yunjie’s words, Mo Qingyun smiled disdainfully and said coldly: "Whether you are the Xue family’s young master or patriarch, today you will die."

"Die!"

As Mo Qingyun spoke, his expression darkened and he stepped on Xue Yunjie’s chest, causing it to cave in with a series of cracking sounds.

"You..."

Feeling Mo Qingyun’s step, Xue Yunjie widened his eyes in disbelief that Mo Qingyun would dare to kill him.

Then, with a look of resentment, he fell to the ground without any breath left.

Silence!

At this moment, time seemed to freeze. Everyone held their breath and stared at Mo Qingyun.

Mo Qingyun actually killed Xue Yunjie, so decisively without hesitation.

Xue Yunjie was the son of the Xue family’s patriarch. Killing him would definitely drive the Xue family’s patriarch mad.

"Dan Young Master, you... you have caused a big trouble. Killing Xue Yunjie will make the Xue family go mad."

The guard captain looked worried and said to Mo Qingyun with a sense of frustration: "If you do this, the Xue family will retaliate against your Mo family. It won’t be easy for our City Lord Mansion and Alchemy Guild to intervene."

"Yes, Qingyun!"

Mo Hongtian sighed and said worriedly: "If the Xue family goes all out against us, it will be troublesome."

"Don’t worry everyone. I have a plan for this."

Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and comforted them, then said: "Besides, if the Xue family attacks us, will they let us off just by not resisting?"

"This..."

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, everyone fell silent. They couldn’t deny that what he said was true.

Even if Mo Qingyun didn’t kill Xue Yunjie and the others, the Xue family wouldn’t let the Mo family off.

"Since that’s the case, does it matter whether I kill Xue Yunjie or not?"

Seeing everyone silent, Mo Qingyun continued: "Yue Ying, strip these guys’ clothes and hang them on the city walls. I want everyone to know what happens when you offend my Mo family."

What?

Strip Xue Yunjie and the others’ clothes and hang them on the city walls!

Mo Qingyun was really going to thoroughly enrage the Xue family.

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, everyone was shocked again.

At this moment, the way they looked at Mo Qingyun had unconsciously changed.

Reckless, domineering, and powerful. This was the feeling Mo Qingyun gave everyone.

"Qingyun, doing this..."

After a brief moment of daze, Mo Hongtian said worriedly and wanted to advise him.

But before he could finish his words, Second Elder Mo Kuixin interrupted: "Master, in today’s world, it is the young people’s era. Let Qingyun do as he pleases. I believe he will bring us surprises."

"This..."

Hearing Mo Kuixin’s words, Mo Hongtian fell silent and nodded: "Since that’s the case, I will go mad with this young man. If our Mo family survives this time, it will be the beginning of our rise."

"Grandfather, don’t worry. Our Mo family will rise."

Seeing Mo Hongtian and the others agree with him, Mo Qingyun was slightly moved and said to Mo Feipeng: "Uncle, make a plaque for me. Write ‘Worthless Xue Family’ on it. The plaque at the Xue family’s mansion should be changed."

"Good young man, I was waiting for you to say this."

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Mo Feipeng laughed and turned to prepare.

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s instructions, the City Lord Mansion guard captain and some others involuntarily twitched.

This Dan Young Master was really vengeful.

And he was bold, such actions would make the Xue family go mad.

At this moment, everyone’s eyes involuntarily added a bit of awe when looking at Mo Qingyun.

They silently warned themselves not to offend Mo Qingyun, he was too vengeful.

After giving all the instructions, Mo Qingyun said to Chi Lian: "Old Chi, stay at the Mo family. I will go to the City Lord Mansion alone."

"Alright!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s words, Chi Lian nodded in agreement.

He knew the reason for Mo Qingyun’s arrangement was to worry that if he left, the Xue family might retaliate and there would be no one at the Mo family to defend.

"Qingyun, you going alone might not be safe. Let Old Chi go with you."

Mo Hongtian said worriedly.

"City Lord Master, I will accompany Dan Young Master," the guard captain beside Mo Hongtian said.

"Then thank you, Captain."

Hearing the guard’s words, Mo Qingyun thanked him.

After that, Mo Qingyun and the City Lord Mansion guard captain went to the City Lord Mansion.
