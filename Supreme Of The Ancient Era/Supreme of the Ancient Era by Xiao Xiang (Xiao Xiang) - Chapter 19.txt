When Du Luo and the others arrived, everyone in the Alchemy Hall showed a look of awe and bowed.

"Since everyone is here, let’s start the competition for the Alchemy Chamber now."

Du Luo swept his gaze over everyone and said, "The first round is a test of alchemy proficiency. We will see who can complete the task in the shortest time."

After Du Luo finished speaking, he instructed that alchemy materials be prepared for Mo Qingyun and the others.

"Begin the competition now. The ten fastest will advance to the next round."

Seeing that the alchemy materials were placed in front of Mo Qingyun and the others, Du Luo said solemnly.

The competition officially began.

Yue Taowen and the others immediately started working, placing each herb in order into the alchemy cauldron.

They naturally did not waste any time with this round of competition.

After placing the herbs in the cauldron and igniting the furnace, Yue Taowen took out a Flame Stone to control the alchemy flames.

With the help of the Flame Stone, he could stabilize the flame more and increase his alchemy efficiency.

As for Xue Ming, he quickly placed each herb in the cauldron and started refining them.

Seeing everyone’s actions, Mo Qingyun did not hesitate. He manipulated his martial soul fire into the alchemy cauldron.

With his martial soul becoming stronger, the power of the martial soul fire he injected into the cauldron was also a bit more powerful than before.

"Such domineering demon fire!"

Feeling the violent flame power from Mo Qingyun’s martial soul fire, Du Luo and the others were startled.

"Qingyun's demon fire seems to have become more powerful."

Zhao Qi frowned and said in surprise.

Clearly, they were quite surprised by this discovery.

"Could it be that his demon fire can grow and become more powerful over time?"

Xu Yu also said with a puzzled expression.

Evolution?

Hearing Xu Yu’s guess, Zhao Qi and Du Luo immediately changed expressions with shock.

If it were true as Xu Yu said, Mo Qingyun’s demon fire would be too powerful.

Under the gaze of Du Luo and the others, Mo Qingyun sequentially placed each herb into the alchemy cauldron.

He began refining the medicine.

Time passed bit by bit.

After about half an hour, Mo Qingyun finally purified all the herbs in his alchemy cauldron.

Seeing this, he raised his hand and lightly tapped on the cauldron like a dragonfly skimming water.

Dragonfly Skimming Water!

At this moment, Mo Qingyun was using precisely this alchemy technique.

"Not bad, not bad!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun skillfully use Dragonfly Skimming Water, Du Luo and the others showed satisfied expressions and nodded. "For a young man like Qingyun to be able to master Dragonfly Skimming Water to this extent is quite rare."

"Hmm, indeed. This little guy’s talent surpasses ours by a lot."

Du Luo chuckled and continued.

Seeing Mo Qingyun praised by Du Luo and the others, Xue Ming immediately showed jealousy.

Then, Xue Ming’s expression darkened. He said disdainfully, "Humph! Just Dragonfly Skimming Water, what’s so great about it? I can do that too."

Following this, Xue Ming lightly tapped his hands, using the same technique as Mo Qingyun.

Clearly, he knew Dragonfly Skimming Water but was not as proficient as Mo Qingyun.

After displaying Dragonfly Skimming Water, Xue Ming shot a challenging look at Mo Qingyun and said, "Kid, Dragonfly Skimming Water isn’t just something you can do."

Mo Qingyun ignored Xue Ming’s words and focused entirely on refining the medicine.

Now, the herbs in his alchemy cauldron were completely purified and had entered the fusion stage.

At this point, one couldn’t be careless.

However, with Mo Qingyun’s current Soul Perception at the Virtual Form Realm, he could clearly see the process of forming pills.

After a few minutes, Mo Qingyun’s alchemy cauldron emitted the scent of medicine.

This indicated that the pills were successfully refined.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun opened his alchemy cauldron and took out the pills with a wave of his hand.

Fifteen Grade One High-Rank Vitality Pills.

Seeing this result, Mo Qingyun showed a satisfied expression.

With the ordinary herbs prepared by the Alchemy Guild, this was already quite impressive.

Then, Mo Qingyun handed the pills to Du Luo and the others for inspection.

"Not bad, not bad!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s refined pills, Du Luo and the others nodded repeatedly. They were quite satisfied with his performance.

In such a short time, using ordinary alchemy materials to refine fifteen Grade One High-Rank Vitality Pills.

It seemed that Mo Qingyun had the ability of a Second Rank Alchemist, otherwise he wouldn’t have been able to do this.

After handing the pills to Du Luo and the others, Mo Qingyun showed a playful smile and said to Xue Ming, "Dragonfly Skimming Water isn’t just something you can do. But the first place in this round is only mine, your speed was too slow."

"You…"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Xue Ming immediately became angry.

In his anger, he inadvertently scattered his mind a bit, weakening his control over the flames in the alchemy cauldron.

Under this negligence of Xue Ming’s, the aura inside his alchemy cauldron immediately became agitated.

This was a trend of exploding pills!

Seeing this, Xue Ming’s expression changed dramatically. Sweat dripped from his forehead as he quickly stabilized the flames in his alchemy cauldron.

Fortunately, his actions were quick enough to stabilize the flames and save this batch of pills.

After a moment, Xue Ming successfully refined his pills.

Possibly due to the unstable flames earlier, the grade of the pills he refined was only Grade One Low-Rank.

Seeing this result, Xue Ming felt ashamed and looked at Mo Qingyun with a resentful expression.

If it weren’t for Mo Qingyun, his pills wouldn’t have been Grade One Low-Rank.

Not long after Xue Ming’s pills were refined, Yue Taowen also successfully refined his batch.

Moreover, the grade of Yue Taowen’s pills was not low; it was also Grade One High-Rank.

However, he had a few less pills than Mo Qingyun, only nine.

But even so, his performance was much better than Xue Ming’s.

Upon hearing this result, Xue Ming’s expression darkened even more. Yue Taowen refined pills of a higher grade than him.

In his view, all this was due to Mo Qingyun’s influence.

Then, Xue Ming looked at Mo Qingyun with even darker eyes.

Not long after, the others also successively refined their pills.

Their pill grades were mostly Grade One Middle-Rank and Low-Rank.

But in this round of the competition, even though their pill grades were better than Xue Ming’s, they still ranked behind him in terms of speed.

Seeing everyone finish refining their pills, Du Luo announced the results.

First Place: Mo Qingyun

Second Place: Xue Ming

Third Place: Yue Taowen

...

Tenth Place: Zhou Rui.

Du Luo announced the top ten names and declared them to advance to the next round.

"Humph! What’s the use of having a high-grade pill? The first round wasn’t about comparing pill grades."

Hearing he was second, Xue Ming’s expression improved a bit. He comforted himself.

Hearing Xue Ming’s self-deception, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and ignored him.

Then, Du Luo announced the results and said, "Next, we will start the second round. Time is unlimited; ranking will be based on the grade of the pills refined."

As Du Luo’s words fell, alchemy materials for refining Grade Two Body Refining Pills were placed in front of Mo Qingyun and the others.

"These are materials for refining Body Refining Pills. You can start now."

Seeing that the herbs were prepared, Du Luo gestured to Mo Qingyun and said they could begin.

Hearing this, Mo Qingyun and the others no longer hesitated and started refining their pills directly.

...

Seeing Du Luo announce the start, Mo Qingyun pointed at the void and summoned a martial soul fire.

This martial soul fire quickly transformed into an illusory beast, exuding a powerful aura.

"Such strong soul power!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s control over the martial soul fire, Du Luo and the others were shocked.

Du Luo asked Zhao Qi beside him with a look of shock, "Old Ghost Zhao Qi, your soul power cultivation is the highest among us. Can you tell what level Qingyun’s soul power has reached?"

"At least Seventh Level of the Extraordinary Realm!"

Zhao Qi said solemnly.

"Hmm!"

Hearing Zhao Qi’s words, Du Luo and Xu Yu both sucked in cold air.

Such soul power at such a young age; this talent was terrifying!

"We underestimated this little guy’s talent."

Du Luo showed a bitter smile, feeling a sense of defeat. Compared to Mo Qingyun’s talent, he was just mediocre.

"This kid has an unlimited future ahead. I never thought that I, Xu Yu, could have such a prodigy as my disciple."

Xu Yu also sighed with joy and satisfaction.

Hearing Xu Yu’s words, Du Luo and Zhao Qi nodded in agreement.

At this moment, while Du Luo and the others were shocked,

Roar!

Mo Qingyun’s illusory beast suddenly let out a loud roar.

Then, everyone saw the illusory beast open its mouth and suck in the alchemy materials.

After sucking in the alchemy materials, the illusory beast started jumping, purifying the herbs.

With each jump, the purity of the alchemy materials increased by a level.

Seeing this scene, Du Luo and the others were momentarily stunned.

They couldn’t believe what they saw was real.

"This… This is Divine Beast Cauldron Technique!"

Du Luo’s heart raced. Surprise, joy, and shock appeared on his face.

Divine Beast Cauldron Technique was a long-lost alchemy technique, and its cultivation difficulty was extremely high.

Who would have thought that Mo Qingyun had mastered this technique, and seemed quite proficient at it?

"Good, good, good…"

At that moment, Xu Yu and the others showed ecstatic expressions, clapping excitedly.

Du Luo and the others were like old children at that moment, completely forgetting about their image.

"Old Ghost Du, with Qingyun’s talent, he might fulfill your wish."

Zhao Qi said to Du Luo.

Du Luo’s wish was clear to Zhao Qi and Xu Yu. It had always been a regret for Du Luo.

But at this moment, they seemed to see that hope in Mo Qingyun.

Hearing Zhao Qi’s words, Du Luo’s body trembled involuntarily. The excitement on his face deepened.

Looking at Mo Qingyun, he was filled with pride and anticipation.

If Mo Qingyun continued to grow, perhaps he could fulfill Du Luo’s wish as Zhao Qi said.

Roar roar roar…

With the beast roars, the alchemy materials were rapidly purified and refined in Mo Qingyun’s illusory beast.

Under Mo Qingyun’s illusory beast’s aura, the flames of others became somewhat chaotic.

Seeing this, everyone looked at Mo Qingyun with a mix of solemnity and awe.

They couldn’t believe that Mo Qingyun’s control over flames had reached such a level.

Time passed bit by bit.

As time went on, Yue Taowen and the others gradually completed their refinement of herbs.

Mo Qingyun continued to purify the alchemy materials, with his illusory beast jumping continuously.

With each jump of the illusory beast, the purity of the alchemy materials increased a bit.

After another hour, someone successfully refined their pills.

This was Zhou Rui. He refined seven Body Refining Pills, but the grade of his pills was only Grade Two Low-Rank.

After Zhou Rui, Yue Taowen also successfully refined his pills. He refined nine pills, all Grade Two Low-Rank.

Overall, his performance was better than Zhou Rui’s.

Then, a few others finished refining their pills. However, their performance was not ideal.

Some failed to refine the pills, while others refined them but did not reach Grade Two.

After a while, more people finished refining their pills. The results were the same; their performance was not ideal.

At this moment, only Mo Qingyun and Xue Ming were still refining their pills.

Suddenly, a fragrant scent came from Xue Ming’s alchemy cauldron.

This indicated that his pills were successfully refined.

Seeing this, Xue Ming’s expression brightened. He opened the alchemy cauldron and took out the pills.

Nine Body Refining Pills!

Although he also refined nine pills, the grade of Xue Ming’s pills was clearly higher than Yue Taowen and Zhou Rui’s.

Grade Two Middle-Rank, Xue Ming refined his pills to Grade Two Middle-Rank.

Hearing this result, Zhou Rui and Yue Taowen’s expressions darkened a bit.

This meant they had no chance to enter the Alchemy Chamber. The qualification was taken by Xue Ming.

At this moment, only Mo Qingyun, who had not yet finished refining his pills, could compete with Xue Ming for the qualification.

Thinking of this, Yue Taowen’s heart was not pleased. He looked at Mo Qingyun with a cold gaze and said, "Mo Qingyun, are you playing around? Do you think that transforming your demon fire into a beast form and jumping can refine pills? If so, refining pills would be too simple."

"Mo Qingyun, if you can’t refine the pills, stop wasting time. Everyone is waiting for you."

After Yue Taowen’s words, Xue Ming also spoke to Mo Qingyun. "Mo Qingyun, refining pills isn’t about showing off; it’s not the more dazzling actions that matter. You can’t refine pills like this, so give up."

Their intention was simple: to distract Mo Qingyun with words and make him lose focus, leading to failure.

"Is he showing off? Could he be from a circus?"

"He might actually succeed."

"It looks like he’ll refine a pile of dung. It’s probably what the beast excretes."

"Ha ha, you’re right! Beast dung is quite apt!"

...

After Yue Taowen’s words, the others also mocked Mo Qingyun.

If observed closely, one could see envy and jealousy in their eyes when they looked at Mo Qingyun.

They envied that he still had a chance to compete with Xue Ming for the qualification, and they were jealous of his alchemy abilities.

Mo Qingyun ignored their words and continued refining the pills with full concentration.

After a moment, the purification of the alchemy materials was complete. Mo Qingyun then started fusing them into pills without delay.

Soon, a fragrant scent came from his alchemy cauldron.

This indicated that Mo Qingyun’s pills were successfully refined.

Seeing this, the surrounding people’s expressions changed a bit. Especially Xue Ming and Yue Taowen.

"Can Mo Qingyun’s pills reach what grade?"

"It’s hard to say. From the feeling, it should be Grade Two."

"If so, Mo Qingyun has a chance to compete with Xue Ming. I wonder who will win in the end."

...

The surroundings were agitated again, with people whispering.

As everyone whispered, Mo Qingyun opened his alchemy cauldron and took out the pills.

Eleven in total, each pill exuding abundant medicinal power.

"Grade Two Top-Rank!"

Seeing the pills Mo Qingyun handed over, Du Luo and the others were stunned. They showed expressions of disbelief.

The pills Mo Qingyun refined reached Grade Two Top-Rank.

"Hmm!"

Hearing Du Luo and the others’ words, everyone sucked in cold air. They looked at Mo Qingyun as if he were a monster.

How old was Mo Qingyun? At most sixteen or seventeen.

Sixteen or seventeen years old, a Grade Two Top-Rank Alchemist. What kind of talent was this?

At that moment, everyone lost their ability to think.

This result exceeded their understanding.

...

Hearing from Du Luo that Mo Qingyun’s pills reached Grade Two Top-Rank, Xue Ming’s smile froze.

Mo Qingyun refined his pills to Grade Two Top-Rank. This meant that the qualification for entering the Alchemy Chamber would be taken by Mo Qingyun.

Thinking of this, Xue Ming shook his head madly. "No… It can’t be Grade Two Top-Rank pills."

After saying this, Xue Ming showed a look of anger and pointed at Mo Qingyun. "You… You cheated, how can you be a Grade Two Top-Rank Alchemist at your age."

"President Du, Mo Qingyun cheated. Cancel his qualification."

At this moment, Xue Ming was mentally disoriented and completely lost composure.

However, from his perspective, it could be understood. He thought he would enter the Alchemy Chamber but was replaced by Mo Qingyun, making it hard for him to accept.

Moreover, Xue Ming and Mo Qingyun had some grudges before. Now that the qualification was taken by Mo Qingyun, he couldn’t feel good about it.

This result was like a slap in the face for him.

"Cheated?"

Mo Qingyun’s expression changed slightly. He looked at Xue Ming disdainfully and said, "Is it your eyes that are blind or do you think everyone else is blind? Everyone saw clearly how I refined the pills just now."

After responding to Xue Ming, Mo Qingyun looked at him disdainfully and said, "Have you heard the phrase ‘a man of ambition is not judged by his age’? To measure a person’s achievement with their age, I can only say you are shallow."

I can only say you are shallow!

When Mo Qingyun said this, everyone in the Alchemy Hall changed expressions. They looked at Xue Ming with a hint of disdain.

Mo Qingyun was right; one’s achievement cannot be measured by age alone. Otherwise, what would talent matter? It would just be about who lives longer.

At the same time, everyone’s gaze towards Mo Qingyun changed completely.

Being able to say ‘a man of ambition is not judged by his age’, Mo Qingyun’s uniqueness was evident.

"Good, good! A man of ambition is not judged by his age!"

Du Luo and the others showed approving expressions, praising Mo Qingyun.

Then, ignoring Xue Ming’s dissatisfaction, Du Luo announced the results. "The competition is over; Mo Qingyun won first place and obtained the qualification to enter the Alchemy Chamber."

Hearing Du Luo’s announcement, everyone looked at Mo Qingyun with envy.

"If there are no other matters, you can leave now," Du Luo said to everyone.

Hearing Du Luo’s words, everyone left one by one.

Among them, some were resentful, envious, disappointed, and hateful…

"His alchemy ability reached Grade Two Top-Rank. A few months ago, he was only at the top of Grade One. This progress speed is…"

Thinking about Mo Qingyun’s alchemy ability, Yue Taowen involuntarily sucked in cold air. A hint of fear appeared in his eyes when he looked at Mo Qingyun.

In a few months, refining one level higher. This speed was terrifying.

When someone’s talent reaches a certain level, it can make many people respect him.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun gave Yue Taowen such a feeling.

"Good kid, you’ve kept us in suspense. I didn’t know you had already advanced to a Grade Two Top-Rank Alchemist."

After everyone left, Du Luo laughed and came in front of Mo Qingyun. He patted his shoulder and said with a laugh.

"From my perspective, it won’t be long before we old guys are surpassed."

Zhao Qi showed a bitter smile and sighed.

Mo Qingyun only took two months to advance from Grade One Top-Rank to Grade Two Top-Rank. He was only a step away from Grade Three Alchemist. This progress speed was quite extraordinary.

"Right now, I feel like there’s nothing left for me to teach you."

Xu Yu also said with a frown.

"Nothing left for you to teach me?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Du Luo and the others were moved. Their eyes became a bit moist.

Mo Qingyun’s words, though not grandiose, touched their hearts the most.

The meaning was clear: no matter what happens in the future, Du Luo and the others would always be his teachers.

"Good kid, we knew we didn’t make a mistake in choosing you."

Du Luo and the others showed satisfaction and praised Mo Qingyun again.

Then, after talking with Du Luo and the others for a while, Mo Qingyun asked, "Teacher, when can I enter the Alchemy Chamber?"

"Tomorrow!" Du Luo replied.

"That’s good. Tomorrow, I’ll come to the Alchemy Guild. Now, I’ll go back and settle some matters."

Mo Qingyun nodded and said goodbye to Du Luo and the others.

"You go," Du Luo and the others nodded.

Then, Mo Qingyun walked towards the Alchemy Guild’s exit, returning to Jade Pavilion Manor.

...

At this moment, as Mo Qingyun left the Alchemy Guild, a few figures followed him.

One of them asked, "Young Master Xue Ming, are you really going to take action against this kid? What if the three old guys find out later and investigate?"

"Find out?"

Xue Ming smiled disdainfully. "How many geniuses fall these days? No one cares about a dead genius."

"Besides, even if they know, what can they do? My brother is now a guest elder of the Du Family in the capital city. Even if they know, they won’t dare to do anything to me."

Xue Ming said with pride and a smile.

"Young Master Xue Ming, you’re wise."

Hearing this, the others said with flattering expressions. "When Young Master Xue Xiao returns, our Mount Tai Sect will dominate the entire Lianyun City."

"Humph! A country bumpkin also wants to compete with me."

Xue Ming said coldly, his expression darkening. "He thinks that getting the approval of those old guys in the Alchemy Guild means he can look down on others. He’s too naive; Lianyun City is deep."

"Young Master Xue Ming, should we take action now or wait until he returns to Jade Pavilion Manor?"

One of the others asked.

"Jade Pavilion Manor is within the City Lord’s territory. The City Lord guards us heavily now, so we don’t need to wait until he returns there."

Xue Ming instructed the others.

"We understand," they nodded. "Young Master Xue Ming, don’t worry; a kid with less than True Qi Realm will be easy prey for us."

"Alright, you go," Xue Ming waved his hand.

Then, the others followed Mo Qingyun, preparing to take action against him.
