Seeing the stall owner's expression at this moment, Mo Qingyun felt a bit of pity and took out a乾坤 bag (Qian Kun Bag) to throw at him, saying, "I’ll take this Spirit Beast Ring."

Subsequently, Mo Qingyun stood up with a faint smile and put the Quan Shen Ring into his乾坤 bag (Qian Kun Bag).

"Two... two million yuan spirit stones!"

When Mo Qingyun took the Spirit Beast Ring, the stall owner opened his乾坤 bag (Qian Kun Bag) and then became completely dazed.

A sea of yuan spirit stones came into view, numbering around two million.

Two million yuan spirit stones!

Upon learning this result, the stall owner's heart rate accelerated, feeling an unreal sensation.

He had always thought that this customer was broke, but he turned out to be a wealthy patron who directly gave double the price.

It was laughable that he had been lowering his prices, hoping the other party would accept it. This scene was quite dramatic.

However, when the stall owner raised his head to look at Mo Qingyun and his companion, he couldn't find their figures.

Upon this discovery, the stall owner couldn’t help but curse, saying, "Damn it, being rich is so任性 (capricious), casually throwing out two million spirit stones as if drinking water."

Chapter 181: Your Battlefield Key I Bought()

A moment later.

Chilin, with a curious expression, asked Mo Qingyun, "Young Master, was that golden ring just now the Quan Shen Ring?"

Hearing Chilin's question, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and replied, "You guessed right; it is indeed the Quan Shen Ring!"

"Really, the Quan Shen Ring!"

Upon receiving confirmation from Mo Qingyun, Chilin's expression twitched in shock, his face showing amazement that lasted for a long time.

The Quan Shen Ring appearing in the Border City was truly unexpected and shocking to him.

After a short while, Chilin calmed his excited emotions and said, "Young Master, the appearance of the Quan Shen Ring here, does it mean that the Hundred Nations Battlefield and that place are connected?"

Hearing this, Mo Qingyun's brows slightly furrowed as he said after a moment of contemplation, "This is temporarily uncertain, but one thing can be confirmed: the Hundred Nations Battlefield is definitely not simple."

Regarding that place mentioned by Chilin, Mo Qingyun was very clear in his heart; it was a place that made people change color upon hearing its name.

Upon hearing Mo Qingyun's words, Chilin fell silent.

That place was a taboo for them; although it was filled with opportunities, it also brimmed with danger.

Even when he had reached the peak of his Divine Sense realm, it was still perilous inside. A slight mistake could cost him his life.

From this, one could see how dangerous that place was.

Thus, it was called the paradise of the strong and also their graveyard.

"Take this Quan Shen Ring."

At that moment, as Chilin was recalling in his mind, Mo Qingyun handed the Quan Shen Ring to him.

"Young Master, this..."

Seeing Mo Qingyun handing the Quan Shen Ring over to him, Chilin's face showed excitement, somewhat unable to believe Mo Qingyun’s actions.

He never thought that such a precious item as the Quan Shen Ring would be given to him by Mo Qingyun.

The Quan Shen Ring, as its name implied, could even imprison a deity, indicating how powerful it was.

Seeing Chilin's expression, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and said, "You are going to the Pill Mansion realm battlefield; it is even more perilous there. With this Quan Shen Ring in your hand, you will have a bit more security. I am counting on you to bring back an army of Pill Mansion realm experts when you come out."

"Old servant will definitely not let Young Master down."

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, Chilin nodded and took the Quan Shen Ring, his face firm with assurance.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun felt that Chilin had more emotions towards him besides reverence.

Subsequently, while conversing with Chilin, they continued walking and discussed some details to pay attention to when entering the Hundred Nations Battlefield.

"Battlefield key, price is for the taker; don't miss this opportunity."

At that moment, as Mo Qingyun and Chilin were walking, a call selling voice reached their ears.

"Battlefield key?"

Hearing this call, Mo Qingyun's expression slightly changed, showing some surprise.

He did not expect that in the inner city’s stalls, there would be someone selling such items.

"Let's go and take a look!"

After a moment of hesitation, Mo Qingyun told Chilin to follow him as he walked towards the stall selling battlefield keys.

A moment later, Mo Qingyun arrived at the stall selling battlefield keys. At this moment, there were many people surrounding it.

All of them had a look of longing as they stared at the battlefield key in the stall owner's hand.

Seeing everyone’s expressions, the stall owner showed a cunning look and shouted again, "Hey! Don't miss out on this; the last battlefield key is here. Come and take a look!"

With the stall owner's shout, more people crowded over. Upon seeing the battlefield key in his hand, they all showed a look of longing.

Among the crowd at that moment was a plump middle-aged man who impatiently urged, "Less talk and more action; tell us how much this battlefield key is."

"Right, you brat, quickly say the price; otherwise, we will all leave."

"Youngster, sell it fast or else I'll give you a hard time."

"Everyone is waiting; if we get impatient, you won't be able to stay in this Border City."

...

After the plump middle-aged man's urging, others followed suit with threats in their tone.

Upon hearing everyone’s urging, the stall owner immediately showed a mocking smile and replied, "Heh heh, since that's the case, I'll give a price. Starting at one million yuan spirit stones, each bid must be no less than five thousand yuan spirit stones."

"Damn it, you brat, are you robbing us? A True Essence realm battlefield key for one million yuan spirit stones."

"The usual price of a True Essence realm battlefield key is only ten thousand yuan spirit stones; you're asking for ten times the price, too greedy."

"You brat, are you playing with us? Do you know what consequences this will bring?"

...

Hearing the stall owner's words, everyone showed dissatisfaction.

However, this stall owner seemed to have anticipated their reactions and smiled apologetically, saying, "Listen everyone, ancient treasures appeared in the battlefield recently. This battlefield key is a token to compete for these ancient treasures; with this battlefield key, you have the chance to compete for the ancient treasures."

"Imagine using one million yuan spirit stones to buy a battlefield key and having the chance to compete for ancient treasures. If you get an ancient treasure, wouldn't that be a huge gain?"

Upon hearing the stall owner's words, everyone’s eyes lit up with greed.

Clearly, his words had stirred their desires and they were gradually losing their rationality.

At the same time, everyone's gaze towards the battlefield key changed as if it were an ancient treasure.

Seeing everyone’s expressions, Mo Qingyun couldn't help but shake his head in admiration of the stall owner's eloquence.

At the same time, he couldn't help but compare this stall owner with the previous one; there was a world of difference between them.

If that previous stall owner had half this stall owner's eloquence, his business would have been much better.

Seeing the atmosphere was right, the stall owner didn't hesitate and immediately said, "Since that's the case, let’s not waste time; start bidding now."

"One hundred and five thousand yuan spirit stones."

As the stall owner's words fell, someone immediately bid.

"One hundred and five thousand yuan spirit stones? You call that a bid; I'll give one hundred and twenty thousand."

"One hundred and thirty thousand!"

...

At this moment, everyone was bidding crazily as if they were mad.

"Three hundred thousand yuan spirit stones."

A moment later, the price of the battlefield key reached three hundred thousand yuan spirit stones. However, at this point, the bidding speed slowed down.

It seemed that three hundred thousand yuan spirit stones was the limit everyone could bear.

At this moment, while everyone around the stall was bidding crazily,

a group of people stood not far from the stall, all with sneering looks as they watched everyone around the stall.

At that moment, one of them said disdainfully, "A bunch of fools; they are competing fiercely only to end up benefiting our Sea Teng少爷 (young master)."

"Haha, without these fools, how could Sea Teng young master easily get this battlefield key?"

While this group of people were talking arrogantly,

Mo Qingyun, standing beside the stall, finally started bidding.

"Five million gold coins."

Seeing no one continue to bid, Mo Qingyun said calmly and announced his price.

After looting the treasures from the Dragon Heaven Gang, Mount Tai Sect, Zhou Family, and Star River Sect, Mo Qingyun's yuan spirit stones had reached an astonishing amount.

So for him, several hundred thousand yuan spirit stones were like a light drizzle.

Mo Qingyun felt that spending several hundred thousand yuan spirit stones to secure the battlefield key was very worthwhile.

"Five million! That brat actually bid five million yuan spirit stones!"

"That kid is so rich; he increased the price by two hundred thousand yuan spirit stones at once, too crazy."

"Is that kid mad? Five million yuan spirit stones for a True Essence realm battlefield key, what kind of wastrel is he from that family."

"Haha, this kid is a fat fish; we can't let him get away later."

...

After Mo Qingyun's bid, everyone’s gaze focused on him with various thoughts.

Ignoring the gazes of others, Mo Qingyun waited for the stall owner's response.

After Mo Qingyun bid, everyone around him fell silent; no one continued to compete.

For them, spending five million yuan spirit stones on a battlefield key was too extravagant.

Seeing no one bid further, Mo Qingyun asked the stall owner, "Can you announce the result now?"

"Ah!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, the stall owner was startled and his face showed an unreal sensation.

It seemed that for him, a True Essence realm battlefield key selling for five million yuan spirit stones was quite unexpected.

After a brief moment of daze, the stall owner showed an excited smile and said to Mo Qingyun, "Congratulations, Young Master. You successfully bid this battlefield key for five million yuan spirit stones; now it belongs to you."

Ignoring the stall owner's flattery, Mo Qingyun threw a乾坤 bag (Qian Kun Bag) at him and said, "This乾坤 bag (Qian Kun Bag) contains five million yuan spirit stones; count them."

After handing over the yuan spirit stones, Mo Qingyun took the True Essence realm battlefield key from him.

After confirming the amount was correct, he left without delay and turned to leave.

"Wait a moment."

However, as Mo Qingyun and Chilin were about to leave,

several figures blocked their path.

Then, a young man stepped out from among them and said coldly to Mo Qingyun, "Kid, I bought your battlefield key."

Chapter 182: Do You Know Who I Am?()

At that moment, with Mo Qingyun's path blocked,

everyone’s attention was drawn to them.

Then, the people nearby quickly surrounded them.

"That young man seems to be Sea Family's Sea Teng; this kid has been targeted by him, really unlucky."

"The Sea Family is one of the top ten powerful families in Xia Kingdom; this kid being targeted by them is indeed unlucky."

"It seems that the battlefield key this kid bought for five million yuan spirit stones will be wasted."

...

Seeing this scene, everyone sighed with sympathy towards Mo Qingyun.

Upon seeing their path blocked,

Mo Qingyun narrowed his eyes and looked up at the other party.

Seeing Mo Qingyun look at him, the young man showed a proud expression and said to him, "Kid, give me your battlefield key for ten thousand yuan spirit stones."

"Ten thousand yuan spirit stones?"

Hearing the young man's words, Mo Qingyun narrowed his eyes again and looked at him with a faint smile, saying, "I'll give you ten yuan spirit stones to buy your mother."

Seeing the young man's actions, Mo Qingyun knew he was trying to force a sale.

To forcibly buy his things, one had to see if the other party was capable of it.

While Mo Qingyun spoke, he released his soul force to sense the other party's cultivation level.

Knowing their cultivation levels,

Mo Qingyun’s smile became even more pronounced.

"You’re looking for death!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, Sea Teng’s face darkened and he said coldly to him, "I’ll give you three breaths of time; hand over the battlefield key immediately or else don’t blame me for being impolite."

Under Mo Qingyun's provocation,

Sea Teng, who had just bid ten thousand yuan spirit stones, was truly angry.

He issued an order to Mo Qingyun and then said with displeasure, "Kid, better think it over; if I take action, it won’t just be about the battlefield key."

However, to Sea Teng's surprise,

Mo Qingyun showed a disdainful smile and said, "I’ll tell you too; get your people to leave soon or else you won’t be able to leave later."

"You actually dare speak to me like this."

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, Sea Teng was slightly surprised by his boldness.

Then he showed a condescending smile and said, "Kid, do you know who I am?"

"Who are you to me?"

Hearing Sea Teng's words, Mo Qingyun smiled disdainfully and replied.

For a moment,

Mo Qingyun and Sea Teng were in a confrontational stance.

Seeing this, everyone’s expressions changed; they were shocked by Mo Qingyun's boldness in confronting Sea Teng.

"That kid is really fearless, daring to speak to Sea Teng like this."

"In my opinion, this kid will soon be in trouble; the Sea Family has a Pill Mansion realm expert accompanying them."

"Not only that, I heard that there is someone from the Sea Family serving as a patrol captain in the patrol team."

"Indeed, the patrol captain is his uncle; he dares to be so arrogant in Border City because of this."

...

At that moment, everyone whispered again with sympathy towards Mo Qingyun.

In their view,

Mo Qingyun confronting Sea Teng was like seeking death.

As everyone looked at Mo Qingyun with sympathy,

Sea Teng’s face darkened and he said coldly to him, "Kid, since you don’t accept my offer of wine, I’ll make you taste some punishment."

"Want to fight?"

Hearing Sea Teng's words, Mo Qingyun’s expression changed slightly and he asked in surprise, "Is fighting allowed in the inner city of Border City?"

Seeing good security earlier,

Mo Qingyun thought that it was forbidden to fight here.

Hearing Sea Teng’s words, he realized the rules were not absolute for the strong.

Upon hearing Mo Qingyun's words,

everyone’s expressions changed again, looking at him with even more sympathy.

In their view,

Mo Qingyun dared to confront Sea Teng because he thought fighting was forbidden in the inner city of Border City.

But who was Sea Teng?

He was a talented young member of the top ten families in Xia Kingdom, nephew of the patrol captain.

For him,

the rules that constrained ordinary people had no effect in Border City.

"Hahaha..."

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, Sea Teng showed a mocking smile and said with a sneer, "Kid, it seems you dared to speak to me like this because you thought fighting was forbidden in the inner city of Border City. This time, you’ll be disappointed."

"Oh, really?"

Mo Qingyun showed a curious expression and looked at Sea Teng with narrowed eyes, waiting for his words.

"Hmph, considering you’re about to hand over the battlefield key, I’ll let you die clearly today."

Sea Teng glanced coldly at Mo Qingyun and said with a sneer, "Ordinary people can’t fight in Border City, but my uncle is the patrol captain here. I’m different from you; now you should die with no regrets."

Hearing Sea Teng’s words, Mo Qingyun showed a knowing expression and said disdainfully, "So you’re using your uncle’s position to favoritism?"

"Favoritism and using power for personal gain?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Sea Teng showed a disdainful smile and said with a sneer, "Kid, the rules and laws are only to constrain ordinary people; they exist for the strong."

"It’s time to send you on your way after talking so much."

Sea Teng smiled coldly and said no more, instructing his people behind him, "Don’t just stand there; move to send this kid on his way."

"Yes, Young Master Sea Teng!"

Hearing Sea Teng’s instructions,

several people behind him immediately moved towards Mo Qingyun and Chilin.

The cultivation levels of Sea Teng’s people were not weak, all reaching the fourth level or above in True Essence realm,

with one of them even at the sixth level.

After responding to Sea Teng, they looked at Mo Qingyun with sympathy and said coldly, "Kid, next time you do things, be more careful; there are some people you can’t offend."

Hearing their words,

Mo Qingyun smiled with a hint of amusement and said, "You’re the same; next time you reincarnate, be more careful. When serving as a lackey for someone, don’t choose the wrong master."

"You’re looking for death!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words,

they all became angry and raised their palms to strike at him.

Without showing any expression towards their attacks,

Mo Qingyun calmly said to Chilin, "Deal with them all."

"Yes, Young Master!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words,

Chilin responded and raised his palm to strike at them.

Instantly, Chilin’s aura became fierce,

and a powerful True Essence force formed into a huge blood-colored palm shadow, pressing down on them.

Bang!

Under Chilin’s strike,

they were all crushed into the ground without any resistance, unable to move for a long time.

Seeing this,

everyone was stunned and couldn’t believe their eyes.

They never expected that the Sea Family’s guards, who were so formidable just now,

would be instantly disabled by this red-haired old man.

This red-haired old man was a True Essence realm high-level expert!

After a brief moment of daze,

everyone’s minds were filled with this thought, looking at Mo Qingyun with a hint of awe.

True Essence realm high-level experts were top-tier existences in Border City.

Seeing Chilin disable the Sea Family’s people,

Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and walked towards a panicked-looking Sea Teng, asking, "Now, do you still want to buy my battlefield key?"

"I..."

Seeing Mo Qingyun approach,

Sea Teng’s expression twitched in fear and he said, "Don’t come over; my uncle is the patrol captain of Border City. If you hurt me, you won’t be able to leave Border City."

"Is that so?"

Hearing Sea Teng’s words,

Mo Qingyun showed a playful smile but didn’t take his words to heart.

"What happened?"

At that moment,

as everyone waited for Mo Qingyun’s next move, a cold voice came from afar.

Then they felt powerful auras approaching them.

They knew that the patrol team had arrived.

Chapter 183: Patrol Team()

Seeing the patrol team arrive,

everyone’s expressions changed, looking at Mo Qingyun and Chilin with sympathy.

They noticed that the middle-aged man in front of the patrol team was Sea Teng’s uncle, Sea Xun.

"Third Uncle save me."

Seeing Sea Xun arrive,

Sea Teng showed a look of surprise and ran towards him.

Hearing Sea Teng’s plea,

seeing the dead Sea Family guards beside him,

Sea Xun’s face darkened.

"Don’t be afraid; no one can harm you with me here."

Seeing Sea Teng in front of him,

Sea Xun comforted him and asked, "Tell me what happened."

"Yes!"

Hearing Sea Xun’s words,

Sea Teng showed a sneer and told him, "It was like this: I just bought a True Essence realm battlefield key from a stall."

"But when we were about to leave, this kid and that red-haired old man suddenly blocked our path and attacked us. Later, they not only killed the guards but also took the battlefield key I bought."

Hearing Sea Teng’s words,

everyone showed a look of disdain; he was clearly distorting the facts.

"How can they do this, don’t they have any rules?"

Hearing Sea Teng’s account,

Sea Xun’s face darkened and he said to Mo Qingyun and Chilin, "You two have great audacity; in the inner city, you dared to commit murder and robbery. Now immediately self-disable your cultivation and come with me for punishment."

At that moment,

Sea Xun’s tone was commanding, as if he were a king whose words could not be defied.

"Self-disable your cultivation and accept punishment?"

Hearing Sea Xun’s command,

Mo Qingyun looked at him disdainfully and asked, "As the patrol captain of Border City, you should enforce the law impartially. But after hearing only his side of the story, you made a hasty judgment to punish us; isn’t that too hasty?"

"Hmph! Do I need your teachings when handling matters?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s question,

Sea Xun’s face darkened even more and he said coldly, "Now you two submit to arrest and come with me to the city’s law enforcement hall for investigation. If it turns out you were wronged, I’ll let you go."

"Submit to arrest?"

Hearing Sea Xun’s words,

Mo Qingyun’s mocking expression became even more pronounced and he said disdainfully, "If we go to the city’s law enforcement hall, it’s likely that we won’t come out alive."

"You two are not cooperating?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words,

Sea Xun’s face darkened even more and he said coldly, "If that’s the case, don’t blame us for being impolite. If we move to arrest you, there’s no guarantee of the outcome."

At that moment,

Sea Xun’s words were filled with threats, clearly warning Mo Qingyun that if they moved to arrest him,

they might execute them on the spot.

"Want to fight, just come and do it; no need for so many words."

Hearing Sea Xun’s hypocritical words,

Mo Qingyun looked at him disdainfully and said mockingly, "Also, since you’re playing the role of a lady’s man, don’t set up a high moral standard for yourself; everyone will laugh at you. Everyone knows the truth, so why need to investigate in the law enforcement hall?"

"Hmph! Bold ruffians daring to resist the law and insult patrol members."

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words,

Sea Xun’s face darkened and he ordered his ten or so guards, "Move now; capture these two ruffians. If they resist, execute them on the spot."

"Yes, Captain!"

Hearing Sea Xun’s order,

the patrol members immediately responded and surrounded Mo Qingyun and Chilin.

At that moment, Sea Teng walked towards one of the patrol members and instructed him, "You, go notify our family’s elders immediately that someone attacked our Sea Family members."

After seeing Chilin's strength just now,

Sea Teng was somewhat worried; these patrol members were not Chilin’s match.

Soon, the patrol members surrounded Mo Qingyun and Chilin,

blocking their path.

Seeing this,

Sea Teng showed a smug smile and looked at Mo Qingyun with a cruel expression, saying coldly, "Kid, this time you’re doomed."

Seeing the scene in front of him,

everyone’s expressions changed and they worried about Mo Qingyun and Chilin.

In their view,

facing so many patrol members attacking them,

their fate seemed bleak.

"This kid is really done for; no one has ever survived under the patrol members’ attacks."

"Yes, their luck is really bad; if the patrol team had come a bit later, they might have escaped."

"Sigh, in Border City, it’s better to stay away from Sea Teng; he is too dangerous."

...

At that moment,

everyone couldn’t help but sigh.

While everyone was sighing in their hearts,

the patrol members started attacking Mo Qingyun and Chilin.

Two-Heaven Separating Wave Palm

Emperor Silent Devil Fist

Moon Piercing Sword Technique

...

At that moment,

various sword lights, fist rays, and palm shadows rained down on Mo Qingyun and Chilin.

"Hmph! Looking for death!"

Seeing the patrol members’ attacks,

Chilin’s face darkened and he said coldly, raising his palm to strike.

Bloodthirsty Devil Palm

Chilin’s palm struck out,

instantly releasing a powerful aura.

True Essence force surged wildly from his palm.

At that moment,

the True Essence force on Chilin’s palm gushed out like a flood, domineering.

As soon as this force appeared,

it formed into a huge blood-colored palm shadow, pressing down on the patrol members.

Bang!

The huge blood-colored palm fell,

causing a tremor in the earth and mountains. All the attacking patrol members were crushed into the ground.

In one move,

more than ten True Essence realm experts were all killed!

Among them, there were even fourth and fifth level experts.

But they were still forcefully crushed under this palm strike.

From this, one could see how terrifying and domineering Chilin’s palm was.

Silence!

At that moment,

the surroundings fell silent; everyone opened their mouths in shock.

Strong! So strong!

This red-haired old man is so strong!

At that moment,

everyone’s minds were filled with this thought.

"How... how can it be like this? How strong is that red-haired old man!"

Seeing Chilin’s terrifying strength,

Sea Teng trembled in his heart, his expression twitching.

Chilin’s power far exceeded his expectations,

and at this moment, he couldn’t help but feel a bit regretful.

For the sake of a True Essence realm battlefield key,

he offended such a terrifying existence; it was really not worth it.

"True Essence realm eighth level!"

Seeing Chilin’s displayed strength,

Sea Xun’s expression changed slightly, his face becoming somewhat solemn.

The power Chilin displayed now made him feel a bit difficult to handle.

But it was just difficult; in Border City, as long as the Pill Mansion realm experts didn’t appear,

he could handle anyone.

Thinking this,

Sea Xun’s expression turned cold, stepping forward slowly and saying coldly, "So you have some strength; that’s why you’re so arrogant. But soon I’ll show you how foolish your actions are."

Hearing Sea Xun’s words,

Chilin looked at him disdainfully and said, "A True Essence realm ninth level peak youngster also dares to talk big in front of an old man like me; let me teach you how to behave."

After Chilin’s words,

he didn’t waste any time and raised his palm towards Sea Xun.

Chapter 184: Pill Mansion Gathered (Second Update)()

Bloodthirsty Devil Palm

As Chilin moved,

a terrifying True Essence force wave burst out from his body.

Then, a huge blood-colored palm shadow condensed as he struck.

Like the Five Finger Mountain,

it descended from the sky towards Sea Xun.

At this moment, this blood-colored giant palm was even more powerful than before,

with a stronger True Essence force wave.

Moreover, there was also a mysterious power emanating from the blood-colored giant palm,

which was the power of might.

"Might... Power of Might!"

Sensing the power of might emanating from the blood-colored palm,

Sea Xun’s expression twitched, his face turning pale as he said in shock, "Pill Mansion... you’re a Pill Mansion realm expert?"

He never expected that the red-haired old man in front of him was actually a Pill Mansion realm expert.

He, at True Essence realm ninth level peak,

was challenging a Pill Mansion realm expert; this was like seeking death.

Thinking of this,

Sea Xun trembled in his heart, looking at Sea Teng with anger.

This fool dared to provoke a Pill Mansion realm expert;

was this something he could casually do?

More importantly,

he dragged him into it; wasn’t this like digging a hole for his uncle to fall in?

While cursing Sea Teng inwardly,

Sea Xun didn’t hesitate and showed a pleading look, saying to Chilin, "Elder... I was wrong; please spare me a dog’s life and I won’t do it again."

"Want to have another chance?"

Hearing Sea Xun’s plea,

Chilin sneered and continued his strike without hesitation.

Bang!

The blood-colored giant palm fell,

causing a terrifying True Essence force wave to spread out.

Under this force wave,

everyone around was pushed back, showing fearful expressions.

Knowing Chilin’s cultivation level now,

everyone’s gaze towards Mo Qingyun and Chilin had completely changed.

Now, there was no sympathy in their eyes,

only intense awe.

A Pill Mansion realm expert;

even throughout the entire Xia Kingdom, this was an absolute powerhouse.

Any family with a Pill Mansion realm expert would be listed among the top families,

regardless of their strength.

From this, one could see how significant a Pill Mansion realm expert was.

Seeing Sea Xun killed by Chilin,

Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and walked towards a panicked-looking Sea Teng, saying, "Now it seems no one can save you."

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words,

Sea Teng’s expression twitched, showing a look of fear as he retreated continuously.

At this moment,

he truly understood how terrifying the person he had provoked was.

Although their Sea Family was strong,

they wouldn’t want to provoke a Pill Mansion realm expert unless absolutely necessary.

With his status in the Sea Family,

they wouldn’t provoke a Pill Mansion realm expert for him.

Thinking this,

Sea Teng’s face turned ashen and he pleaded with Mo Qingyun, "Elder... please spare me; treat me like a dog."

"Spare you?"

Hearing Sea Teng’s words,

Mo Qingyun looked at him disdainfully and said, "Comparing you to a dog is an insult to dogs; so, go die."

After Mo Qingyun’s words,

he raised his palm and struck Sea Teng in the head.

"No... don’t!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun strike,

Sea Teng showed a look of despair and shouted loudly.

Although he was extremely frightened in his heart,

under Chilin’s pressure, his body couldn’t move.

"Stop!"

At that moment,

as Mo Qingyun struck out with his palm, a cold shout came from the sky.

Then, Mo Qingyun saw a figure flying towards them at high speed.
