Upon hearing Bai Xiang’s words, Ling Luo immediately refused and stood in front of Mo Qingyun and the others with a proud expression. "If you want to move my brothers, first get past me."

Seeing Ling Luo’s actions, Mo Qingyun and the others all changed their expressions, feeling a bit touched.

Given Ling Luo’s unreliable personality, it was quite surprising and touching that he could say such words at this moment.

"Since you’ve acknowledged me as your leader, how can I let you fight alone against so many?"

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and stepped forward to block Ling Luo behind him. "Ling Luo, you first retreat with Long Yutian and the others; I’ll handle the rest."

"Leader!"

"Brother Mo!"

"Qingyun!"

Upon hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Lu Fangliang and the others immediately showed expressions of surprise, shocked by Mo Qingyun’s words.

"Haha, don’t worry; they’re just a few small fry!"

Seeing Lu Fangliang and the others’ expressions, Mo Qingyun smiled indifferently. "After cultivating in the cave for so long, it’s time to stretch our limbs; let’s use them as a warm-up."

"But..."

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Lu Fangliang and the others again showed expressions of concern, wanting to persuade Mo Qingyun.

Before they could finish their words, Mo Qingyun raised his hand and interrupted them.

With a comforting smile on his face after interrupting Lu Fangliang’s words, Mo Qingyun continued. "You can stand by and support me; if I really can’t hold up, you can step in."

"Of course, if someone tries to sneak attack, you can help deal with them." Mo Qingyun added.

"Alright, if that’s the case, we’ll stand by and support you."

Hearing Mo Qingyun say this, Long Yutian and the others no longer spoke much. They replied with a faint smile. "Brother Mo, go ahead and fight without any worries; if anyone dares to sneak attack, we’ll deal with them."

"Very well then!" Hearing Long Yutian’s words, Mo Qingyun laughed and nodded in response.

Then, with a proud look on his face, Mo Qingyun looked at the people from Eagle Peak and said coolly. "Who’s first?"

Who’s first?

As soon as Mo Qingyun spoke, the surrounding people all changed their expressions and showed looks of surprise at his performance.

A person with a True Essence Realm Third Level cultivation, facing the people from Eagle Peak, dared to be so arrogant.

This scene was indeed quite unexpected for everyone.

"This kid is very arrogant, daring to speak like this to the Eagle Kingdom."

"I think he’s just not aware of his own situation; if he saw how the people from Jade Kingdom died, he wouldn’t dare to speak like this."

"In my opinion, this kid must have obtained some treasures in the Nine Palaces Secret Treasure; that’s why he’s so confident."

"Haha, it would be best if they fight to the death; we can then reap the benefits."

...

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s performance, people from various kingdoms immediately expressed their thoughts.

"Mo Qingyun, you’re still so arrogant."

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s performance, the Du family people all showed sneering expressions. "You’ll know soon enough that being overly confident comes with a price."

"Trying to take on the entire Eagle Kingdom by yourself is too foolish."

Another Du family person sneered. "Mo Qingyun, even if you defeat the Eagle Kingdom, I’ll still prepare a bigger gift for you."

At this moment, as everyone was thinking their own thoughts, Bai Xiang showed a sneer. "This is good; it prevents the Ninth Prince from getting involved and being hurt in the chaos."

"Boy, I admire your courage; however, you’re not qualified enough for me to take action."

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s performance, Eagle Peak showed a disdainful expression and said to Lei Hao. "Brother Lei, since this kid has grudges against your kingdom, let him be dealt with by the Thunder Kingdom."

Hearing Eagle Peak’s words, Lei Hao’s expression slightly changed, showing a hint of dissatisfaction.

At this moment, Eagle Peak seemed to be giving him the chance for revenge but was actually using him as a pawn to test Mo Qingyun’s depth.

Mo Qingyun’s current performance was quite unusual; it might be that he obtained some powerful trump cards in the Nine Palaces Secret Treasure.

If so, the people from Eagle Kingdom might fall into his trap when they attack Mo Qingyun.

Eagle Peak was worried about this situation, so he let Lei Hao take the lead and test Mo Qingyun’s depth first to consume some of his trump cards.

One could say that Eagle Peak’s actions were quite cunning at this moment.

Moreover, with Lei Hao as a ready pawn to use, why would Eagle Peak not take advantage of him?

"Thank you for your kindness, Brother Eagle!"

Although knowing Eagle Peak’s intentions, Lei Hao could not refuse at this moment. He thanked him with a raised hand.

Then, Lei Hao looked at Mo Qingyun with a grim expression and coldly said. "Boy, if you surrender now, I can leave your body intact."

Hearing Lei Hao’s words again, Mo Qingyun glanced at him disdainfully and said impatiently. "If you want to fight, come on; don’t waste words. I’m not very patient with some lackeys."

Lackey!

As soon as Mo Qingyun said this, it was like a sharp needle piercing Lei Hao’s heart.

From his conversation with Eagle Peak just now, his current actions were indeed like a lackey of Eagle Peak.

Receiving instructions from the master, he immediately understood and barked at others recklessly.

Seeing people’s expressions change because of Mo Qingyun’s words, Lei Hao became furious.

"Boy, since you’re looking for death, I’ll fulfill your wish!"

As Lei Hao’s words fell, he struck Mo Qingyun with a palm, the power of True Essence Realm Seventh Level instantly bursting forth.

Thunder Moves the Four Seas

As Lei Hao struck out with his palm, terrifying lightning power erupted from his palms, exuding a destructive aura.

That lightning power was like the electric light connecting heaven and earth in a stormy sea, as if it could split the heavens and earth.

"Lightning power, not bad!"

Seeing Lei Hao’s attack, Mo Qingyun’s eyes lit up and a faint smile appeared on his lips. He had an idea in mind.

At this moment, Lei Hao’s attack was extremely fast; in the blink of an eye, his powerful strike hit Mo Qingyun.

Seeing this scene, everyone’s expressions changed with some surprise at the result.

Mo Qingyun was hit by Lei Hao without any resistance!

This didn’t match with Mo Qingyun’s boastful demeanor just now at all!

The combat power Mo Qingyun displayed was a bit too weak, wasn’t it?

Seeing this scene, everyone briefly fell silent before they erupted with exclamations.

"Phew, I thought this kid obtained some treasures in the Nine Palaces Secret Treasure and had powerful trump cards to be so arrogant."

"So did I; damn it, after all this fuss, this kid turned out to be so weak, with no trump cards at all."

"This kid is a silver spear wax candle; I’ve been waiting in vain. It seems the Nine Palaces Secret Treasure isn’t much."

"Really boring; killed by a strike from Thunder Kingdom. Hope the remaining ones have some show to watch."

...

At this moment, everyone’s expressions showed disappointment and mockery.

"Something is off!"

As people mocked him, the Du family people all frowned, feeling that this scene was unusual.

According to their understanding of Mo Qingyun, he shouldn’t be so weak.

This scene was too unusual; the Du family people all had this thought in their minds.

"Boy, aren’t you very powerful? How come now you’re so foolish and can’t even withstand Lei Hao’s strike?"

Seeing Mo Qingyun hit by Lei Hao, Ma Jue and the others immediately showed sneering expressions with smug words.

Seeing their smug looks, it seemed as if they themselves had struck Mo Qingyun.

Seeing Mo Qingyun hit by his strike and swallowed up by lightning, Lei Hao showed a disdainful look and looked at Mo Qingyun with contempt. "Weakling!"

"Brother Mo..."

Seeing Mo Qingyun hit by Lei Hao and swallowed up by lightning, Long Yutian and the others immediately showed concern.

Then, they ran towards Mo Qingyun to see his condition.

"Wow!"

What surprised Long Yutian and the others was that when they approached Mo Qingyun, he said a word of enjoyment.

Everyone’s expressions immediately changed; almost unable to believe their ears.

Mo Qingyun was hit by Lei Hao and swallowed up by violent lightning power, yet he said it felt good?

This meant Mo Qingyun not only wasn’t hurt but also enjoyed the state.

Wasn’t this too powerful and bizarre?

At this moment, everyone’s minds were in chaos; Mo Qingyun’s performance completely exceeded their understanding.

Bang!

As everyone was shocked, Mo Qingyun dispersed the lightning power around him and revealed his body without any harm.

After dispersing the lightning power, Mo Qingyun showed a look of satisfaction and said to Lei Hao. "The strength was slightly less; if you added more, it would have been even better."

Chapter 218: Do You Want to Know?

If you added more, it would have been even better?

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, everyone was speechless; they didn’t know how to express their thoughts.

Being hit by a True Essence Realm Seventh Level expert’s palm and still finding the strength insufficient, was this what normal people said?

Then, everyone looked at Mo Qingyun with strange expressions as if he was a monster.

Withstanding the full power strike of a True Essence Realm Seventh Level expert without any harm, how strong must his body be?

They didn’t know that Mo Qingyun had cultivated the Golden Jade True Body to an Art level, and when he exerted it, his body’s strength was comparable to gold and jade.

Even if Lei Hao’s essence power struck him, even a common sword wouldn’t leave any marks on his body.

After a brief silence, the surroundings became agitated with exclamations of amazement.

"You guys have no eyes; such a powerful person, and you call him a silver spear wax candle!"

"Phew, didn’t you just say that? You’re blaming others for your own words; do you still have any face?"

"Hmph! Even if he’s powerful, what can he do? You should know that Lei Hao is much stronger than Bai Xiang."

"That’s true; the truly powerful people from Eagle Kingdom haven’t acted yet."

...

At this moment, everyone expressed their thoughts.

"Leader, you’re amazing; you didn’t get hurt by Lei Hao’s strike!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun unharmed, Ling Luo showed a look of surprise and kept looking at him.

As for Long Yutian and the others, they showed similar expressions as Ling Luo, looking at Mo Qingyun.

They all found it hard to believe that Mo Qingyun wasn’t hurt by Lei Hao’s strike.

Seeing everyone’s expressions, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly. "Lei Hao didn’t suckle when he struck; that’s why his hands weren’t strong. Nothing strange about it."

Didn’t suckle when he struck; that’s why his hands weren’t strong?

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Ling Luo and the others were dumbfounded, almost unable to believe their ears.

They wanted to ask if sucking with all one’s might was understood like this.

"Spit, lewd!"

After a brief moment of daze, Luo Fangliang blushed and glared at Mo Qingyun with a beautiful look.

As for the others, they all held back their laughter; they wanted to laugh but dared not do so.

They were worried that if they laughed, Lei Hao would take it out on them; how uncomfortable that would be.

"Boy, you’re looking for death!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Lei Hao’s expression immediately darkened and he struck Mo Qingyun again.

Thunder Splits Mountains and Rivers

As Lei Hao struck out with his palm, the lightning power in his palms surged forth, pressing towards Mo Qingyun.

At this moment, Lei Hao’s palm strike was much more powerful than his previous one.

Boom...

As Lei Hao struck, the terrifying essence power emitted a low rumbling sound.

After striking, Lei Hao showed a ferocious look and said coldly to Mo Qingyun. "Boy, have the guts to take another strike from me."

"Another strike? So what!"

Hearing Lei Hao’s words, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and replied indifferently.

Then, he again withstood Lei Hao’s strike, allowing the violent essence power to swallow him up.

Sizzle...

After this terrifying lightning power swallowed Mo Qingyun, it emitted a series of thunder sounds, sparks flying and light flashing.

Seeing this scene, everyone’s expressions twitched; they felt a bit scared.

They couldn’t help but think about what would happen if they were hit by this lightning power.

With this thought, everyone stared at Mo Qingyun intently, wanting to see if he could withstand the strike.

Gulp...

After a while, someone couldn’t help but swallow; they stared intently at Mo Qingyun surrounded by lightning.

After this swallowing sound, the surrounding calm was gradually broken.

"Tell me, is that kid still alive?"

"Don’t know; Lei Hao’s strike just now, even a True Essence Realm Ninth Level expert wouldn’t dare to withstand it."

"In my opinion, that kid must have overestimated himself and was struck dead by Lei Hao’s strike."

"Most likely; otherwise, he wouldn’t have been silent for so long."

...

Seeing Mo Qingyun silent for a while, everyone’s expressions changed as they whispered.

At this moment, Luo Fangliang and the others asked Mo Qingyun with serious expressions. "Brother Mo, are you alright?"

Hearing Luo Fangliang’s words, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and replied. "Brother Lu, don’t worry; I’m fine."

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Long Yutian and the others immediately relaxed; they gradually calmed down.

From Mo Qingyun’s voice, it seemed he was fine.

However, while they relaxed, they were also shocked.

The terrifying power of Lei Hao’s strike was the clearest to them because they were closest; even a True Essence Realm Ninth Level expert wouldn’t fare well against it.

Now, Mo Qingyun withstood Lei Hao’s strike without any harm; his body must be much stronger than a True Essence Realm Ninth Level expert.

Thinking this, Long Yutian and the others looked at Mo Qingyun with different expressions.

"Boastful!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s conversation with Luo Fangliang, Lei Hao sneered and said coldly. "Boy, don’t you fear your tongue will be stunned by boasting; even a True Essence Realm Ninth Level expert can’t withstand my strike, yet you say it’s fine."

Hearing Lei Hao’s words, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and replied indifferently. "They can’t; it doesn’t mean I can’t!"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Lei Hao’s expression twisted; he gritted his teeth. "If so, why haven’t you broken through the essence power lightning aura after such a long time?"

"Breaking through this essence power lightning aura is not difficult!"

Hearing Lei Hao’s words, Mo Qingyun smiled indifferently and replied. "I didn’t immediately disperse the essence power lightning aura because your strike was powerful, making me feel comfortable; I wanted to enjoy it a bit longer."

"Break for me!"

As Mo Qingyun spoke, he raised his hand and struck out; instantly, the essence power lightning aura around him was dispersed.

Then, Mo Qingyun’s body slowly appeared in everyone’s sight.

"You... you’re actually fine?"

Seeing the unharmed Mo Qingyun, Lei Hao’s expression involuntarily twitched; he looked at Mo Qingyun with a bit of fear.

Seeing Lei Hao’s expression, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and replied. "The strike you just gave was like sucking with all your might, but it’s from a stepmother; if it were from a mother, I might not have been able to withstand it."

From a stepmother?

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, everyone’s expressions changed again; they looked somewhat strange.

There was such a distinction?

Then, people looked at Lei Hao with some ridicule in their eyes.

Conversely, they looked at Mo Qingyun with more admiration.

Damaging others to this extent was also a kind of realm, wasn’t it?

At this moment, as everyone was shocked by Mo Qingyun’s words, Long Yutian and the others suddenly noticed that there were some lightning arcs flashing on Mo Qingyun’s body.

After these lightning arcs flashed, they were absorbed into his body and directly refined.

As these lightning arcs were refined, the luster on Mo Qingyun’s face seemed to have become even stronger.

Seeing this, Long Yutian and the others immediately thought of something.

Mo Qingyun was absorbing lightning power!

This meant that Mo Qingyun’s actions just now were actually using Lei Hao’s essence power lightning aura to refine his body.

That is, all of Lei Hao’s attacks just now were like a grindstone for Mo Qingyun.

Seeing this, Long Yutian and the others immediately showed shocked expressions; a wave of shock rose in their hearts.

Even a True Essence Realm Ninth Level expert dared not withstand the essence power lightning aura, yet Mo Qingyun used it to refine his body; how powerful was that?

At this moment, as Long Yutian and the others were shocked, everyone else also noticed something unusual about Mo Qingyun.

"This... this guy just used Lei Hao’s essence power lightning aura to refine his body!"

"How is that possible? Such terrifying lightning aura, if we touched it a bit, our bodies would be shattered; how could it be used to refine the body."

"How did he do that? Is this his powerful trump card obtained in the Nine Palaces Secret Treasure?"

"This guy is a monster from somewhere; Lei Hao must be unlucky to meet him."

...

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s intentions, everyone was shocked and exclaimed.

Compared to the others’ shock, Long Yutian and the others showed delighted expressions as they walked towards Mo Qingyun.

"Wow, Leader you’re amazing; how did you do that?"

Long Yutian showed an excited expression and kept waving his fists as if he were Mo Qingyun.

Seeing Long Yutian’s reaction, the others also showed shocked expressions and curiously looked at Mo Qingyun.

"Just a body-refining martial technique."

Seeing Long Yutian’s curious expressions, Mo Qingyun replied faintly. "If you want to learn it, I can teach you later."

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Lei Hao immediately changed his expression and asked excitedly. "Boy, the body-refining martial technique you just used was obtained in the Nine Palaces Secret Treasure?"

Hearing Lei Hao’s words, Mo Qingyun showed a teasing expression and looked at Lei Hong. "Do you want to know?"

"Will you tell me?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Lei Hao changed his expression and looked at him with anticipation.

"Did you say?"

Seeing Lei Hao’s expectant look, Mo Qingyun glanced at him coldly and said. "After I send you to meet Lei Hong, then I’ll tell you."

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Lei Hao immediately knew he was being teased; his expression darkened. "Boy, you’re looking for death!"

At this moment, Lei Hao struck without any reservation and summoned his martial soul.

Cloud Lightning Demon Wolf, appear!

Under Lei Hao’s summoning, a huge silver figure appeared above his body.

This was Lei Hao’s martial soul, a top-tier tenth-level martial soul, Cloud Lightning Demon Wolf.

After summoning his martial soul, Lei Hao didn’t hesitate and immediately used its divine ability.

Thunder Wolf Howls at the Moon!

As Lei Hao’s martial soul divine ability appeared, everyone saw silver wolf shadows in the sky.

These silver wolf shadows formed and howled towards the sky, emitting soul-shaking howls.

As these howls came from the silver wolf shadows, they turned into sound waves like sea waves and rapidly spread out.

Under these sound waves’ impact, wherever they passed, sand and stones flew, leaving traces of lightning.

This martial soul divine ability contained thunder attacks within the sound waves.

Pfft...

Under Lei Hao’s martial soul divine ability, a person with weaker cultivation who couldn’t dodge was directly struck and spat blood.

"Sound wave martial soul divine ability?"

Seeing Lei Hao’s martial soul divine ability, Mo Qingyun curled his lips and said with a faint smile. "Didn’t you hear that sound waves are ineffective against me? When I killed Lei Hong, he also used a sound wave martial soul divine ability on me; he died."

As Mo Qingyun spoke, he took out a silver drum and struck it with his palm.

Storm Thunder Sound

As Mo Qingyun’s palm hit the silver drum, its membrane vibrated and emitted a loud sound, turning into a wave of sound.

Bang! Bang! Bang...

As this wave of sound formed, Mo Qingyun continuously struck the silver drum.

Then, one after another, waves of sound emerged from the silver drum and attacked the silver wolf shadows like sea waves.

Boom! Boom! Boom...

Then, these sound waves collided with the silver wolf shadows and emitted low rumbling sounds, like two clouds rubbing against each other.

Soon, a powerful force wave rapidly spread out from their collision and swept around.

After a moment, as this terrifying force wave gradually dissipated, Lei Hao’s martial soul divine ability was also resolved by Mo Qingyun.

"You... you actually broke my martial soul divine ability!"

Seeing his strongest attack easily resolved by Mo Qingyun, Lei Hao’s expression turned fearful.

He found it hard to believe that this was real.

A person with True Essence Realm Third Level cultivation, without summoning a martial soul, easily resolved his martial soul divine ability.

This was the first time he had encountered such a thing; it was hard for him to accept.

Ignoring Lei Hao’s shock, Mo Qingyun resolved his attack and immediately struck back at him.

At this moment, when Mo Qingyun attacked again, he didn’t hold back.

Azure Flame Heavenly Dragon, appear!

Then, Mo Qingyun summoned his martial soul; a huge red figure appeared above him.

As the Azure Flame Heavenly Dragon appeared, it released its soul power and enhanced Mo Qingyun’s body.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun didn’t hesitate; he immediately used his martial soul divine ability.

Blood Energy Frenzy!

As Mo Qingyun’s martial soul divine ability appeared, his aura rapidly increased.

Soon, his aura reached the True Essence Realm Sixth Level.

"What... what martial soul divine ability is this?"

Feeling Mo Qingyun’s aura, Lei Hao’s expression twitched; his fear intensified.

When he looked at Mo Qingyun again, intense fear appeared in his eyes.

Mo Qingyun’s current display was beyond his acceptance range.

At this moment, not only did Lei Hao show a fearful expression; Eagle Peak and the others also showed shocked expressions.

"Heavenly Dragon Martial Soul, this kid actually has such talent!"

Seeing the Azure Flame Heavenly Dragon above Mo Qingyun’s body, Eagle Peak showed a fluctuating expression and felt intense shock. "Who is this kid? With such talent, he shouldn’t be an unknown person; why haven’t I heard of him in the Ten Great Kingdoms?"

"Martial soul divine ability that can increase three minor realms, this kid’s martial soul divine ability is so strong!"

As Eagle Peak showed shock, Bai Xiang also changed his expression and looked at Mo Qingyun with a cold look; jealousy flashed in his eyes.

He found it hard to accept that an unknown kid could have such talent.

If he had this talent, his status in Sword Kingdom would immediately rise; he might even be promoted to prince like the Third Prince.

At this moment, as Eagle Peak and the others showed shock, people from other kingdoms saw Mo Qingyun’s martial soul and were stunned; they rubbed their eyes.

"Am I... not seeing things? This kid’s martial soul is actually Heavenly Dragon Martial Soul?"

"And his martial soul divine ability is so strong, increasing three minor realms; this is too bizarre."

"Who is this kid? With such talent, he’s probably one of the Ten Great Kingdoms’ super geniuses."

"If this kid survives today, he’ll be a terrifying existence in the future."

...

At this moment, people from various kingdoms all had different thoughts seeing Mo Qingyun’s martial soul.

As everyone showed shock, Mo Qingyun looked at Lei Hao with a cold expression and said. "After letting you show off for so long, it’s my turn now."

Fierce Beasts Break

Golden Jade True Body

As Mo Qingyun spoke, he moved and turned into a streak of light, powerfully charging towards Lei Hao.

At this moment, as Mo Qingyun moved, a mysterious force emerged from his body; it was the Art power.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun displayed the Wind Art without reservation, increasing his speed to its peak.

"Art... Art power!"

Feeling Mo Qingyun’s Art power, Lei Hao’s expression twitched; fear appeared on his face.

He didn’t expect Mo Qingyun to have领悟ed Art power; this made his situation worse.

The difference in strength between a person with and without Art power was huge.

Before Lei Hao could recover, Mo Qingyun had already approached; he directly used his body to collide with him.

"Run!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s body charging towards him, Lei Hao’s expression twitched; the thought of running for his life rose in his heart.

He wasn’t as tough as Mo Qingyun; if he was hit directly, his small body would be shattered.

Then, Lei Hao didn’t hesitate and turned to run away.

"Want to escape?"

Seeing Lei Hao’s actions, Mo Qingyun curled his lips and showed a teasing smile. "You can’t escape!"

Gravity Suppression!

As he mocked, Mo Qingyun released the Earth Art to affect Lei Hao’s movement.

Under the influence of the Earth Art, Lei Hao’s speed rapidly decreased; soon, he was caught up by Mo Qingyun.

Bang!

Then, Lei Hao was powerfully hit by Mo Qingyun; his body flew out like a billiard ball.

Crack...

As Lei Hao was hit and flew, his body made sounds like popping beans; half of his bones were broken by Mo Qingyun’s powerful hit.

Pfft!

After landing, Lei Hao spat blood and his face turned pale; without the support of bones, he lay on the ground like a pile of mud and couldn’t move.

"Lei Hao was crippled by that kid; this kid is too domineering!"

"Woah, I’ve never seen such a brutal attack method; is this kid a caveman?"

"Too bizarre, too bizarre; this kid’s body is like a human weapon!"

"Woah, what a strong man; he must be very impressive in bed!"

...

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s heroic performance, people from various kingdoms all showed shocked expressions.

"Wind Art and Earth Art; this kid actually领悟ed two Arts!"

At this moment, as people from various kingdoms were shocked, Eagle Peak and Bai Xiang showed changed expressions; a wave of shock rose in their hearts.

From Mo Qingyun’s current display, he brought them great threat.

Mo Qingyun was only True Essence Realm Third Level but had领悟ed two Arts; his talent was terrifying.

Moreover, Mo Qingyun also had Heavenly Dragon Martial Soul; this made his talent even more frightening.

"This kid can’t be left alive!"

At this moment, Eagle Peak and Bai Xiang’s eyes flickered; they all had the thought of not leaving Mo Qingyun alive.

They knew that with such talent, if they offended him, it was better to destroy him directly; otherwise, it would be like letting a tiger back into the mountains with endless troubles.

"Boy, die!"

As this thought appeared, Bai Xiang’s expression turned cold and he slashed at Mo Qingyun with his sword.

"Sneak attack?"

Seeing Bai Xiang’s actions, Long Yutian and the others changed their expressions; they showed disdainful looks. "We knew you’d be sneaky, Brother Mo; ask us first."

"Form an array and kill!"

As Long Yutian’s words fell, they immediately formed an array and charged at Bai Xiang.
