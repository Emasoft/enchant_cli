“Thus, we shouldn’t give up and should return to guard outside the Jadeite Mansion?”

Du Wangchuan asked, revealing a hint of worry. He continued, “But if that person is related to the Jadeite Mansion, and I cause trouble for them again, wouldn’t it be defying his will? If he gets angry, our Du family might not bear the consequences.”

“Senior Wangchuan, do you think that person came from those places?”

Du Wangyang’s gaze was sharp and cold. He said, “I heard that outside the Dynasty there are many powerful forces with certain rules; they don’t interfere in the affairs inside the Dynasty, or else they will face severe penalties. Perhaps that person didn’t attack us because of this.”

“Very possible!”

The elders nodded in agreement. “If that’s the case, we don’t need to worry about him.”

“Moreover, if we return and guard outside the Jadeite Mansion, trapping them inside, he might not even discover us if we don’t act.”

“Senior Wangyang’s words make sense!”

After Du Wangyang spoke, Du Wangchuan revealed a cold expression and said sternly, “Humph! We’ll return to Lianyun City.”

Then Du Wangchuan moved and returned towards Lianyun City.

...

...

At this moment, as the Du family returned to Lianyun City.

In a dense forest, a woman revealed a cold smile and said coldly, “Yu Qianyi, since you brought Princess Ling back to the Xuan Yue Palace, now I’ll see who can stop me from killing those ants in the Jadeite Mansion.”

This woman was Luo Yuan, who had been injured by Yu Qianyi in the Jadeite Mansion.

After being injured and leaving the Jadeite Mansion, she did not immediately return to Xuan Yue Palace.

Instead, she stayed on a path leading from Lianyun City to Xuan Yue Palace, planning to recover her injuries while waiting for Yu Qianyi to leave the Jadeite Mansion before returning to take revenge.

After a few days, she finally saw Yu Qianyi leave with Mo Ling. Now, she could seek revenge on the Mo family.

“Mo Yue Ru, you wretched woman, I’ll make your clan suffer.”

Luo Yuan spoke coldly and rushed towards the Jadeite Mansion.

...

...

After setting up the ice cellar array to solve food preservation issues, Mo Qingyun began his seclusion.

This time, he did not cultivate but instead focused on refining pills. He planned to refine all his medicinal materials into pills for the Mo family to enhance their cultivation.

This idea had been in Mo Qingyun’s mind for a long time but was delayed until now. While Mo Qingyun refined the pills, the Alchemy Alliance Guild members were also working hard to refine their own.

Now, it was better for everyone’s cultivation if the medicinal materials were turned into pills rather than kept as raw materials.

Others focused on cultivating, striving to enhance their cultivation levels. Thus, a wave of intense cultivation swept through the Jadeite Mansion.

Time passed as everyone cultivated.

Suddenly, after a day,

Bang!

A loud sound came from the Seven Star Killing Array. A terrifying aura of essence energy spread out.

Someone was breaking the array!

Upon this discovery, everyone in the Jadeite Mansion changed their expressions and headed outside.

Outside, they saw a graceful figure wielding a long sword, fiercely attacking the array.

Seeing this figure, everyone’s expressions changed and became solemn. Luo Yuan!

The person breaking the array was Luo Yuan who had come with Yu Qianyi, and she had returned.

Everyone knew her strength was at the Sixth Level of Pill Mansion Realm. If she fiercely attacked, no one could be sure if she would break the array.

After all, her cultivation was just a step away from high-level Pill Mansion Realm. Of course, they did not know that Mo Qingyun and Yu Qianyi had improved the array, enhancing both its attack and defense.

“Didn’t she leave?”

Wan Lianyun looked solemn, worriedly watching Luo Yuan outside the array.

“Who would have thought she returned.”

Du Luo and others looked solemn, saying, “If the Du family returns and joins her to break the array, it will be very troublesome.”

“What should we do?”

Mo Hongtian looked worried and asked Wan Lianyun and others for their opinions.

Everyone suddenly realized Mo Qingyun was not here, making them feel a bit aimless.

At this moment, Qi Lian looked calm and comforted everyone, “Don’t worry. The Seven Star Killing Array has been improved by the Young Master and Yu Qianyi, enhancing its power. With her strength, she can’t break it.”

Qi Lian continued, “We should observe the situation and wait for the Young Master to finish refining pills. Then we can discuss a plan.”

“Alright!”

After hearing Qi Lian’s words, everyone’s worries eased.

They believed Qi Lian, now a Pill Mansion Realm powerhouse with sharper insight, was right.

Following this, everyone watched Luo Yuan’s actions while waiting for Mo Qingyun.

About an hour later,

Mo Qingyun finished refining pills, left the courtyard and came towards everyone.

“Luo Yuan! This woman has returned!”

Mo Qingyun greeted everyone, looking at Luo Yuan outside the array with surprise.

After a glance, Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened and he said coldly to Luo Yuan, “Luo Yuan, do you fear the punishment from the State Region for attacking people in a lower Dynasty?”

“Punishment from the State Region?”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Luo Yuan paused her actions and sneered coldly. “Boy, do you think anyone will report this to the State Region after I kill all of you?”

Luo Yuan sneered again, “Moreover, do you think the powerful forces in the State Region will care about your deaths?”

Everyone’s expressions changed, their faces turning grim. Luo Yuan was right; the powerful forces in the State Region wouldn’t care about some minor figures.

With her background, even if she killed Mo Qingyun and others, it wouldn’t be a big deal. Her father was an elder of the Xuan Yue Palace and a powerhouse at Heaven Girdle Realm. If she got into trouble, her father would protect her.

Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened after hearing Luo Yuan. He looked at her coldly and said, “Humph! Since you don’t know when to back down, I’ll give you a taste of hardship.”

“Haha, boy, your tone is quite big.”

Luo Yuan sneered and said, “Boy, last time I was careless and got hit by your soul attack. Do you think you can sneak attack me again? Once I break this array, I’ll tear all of you apart.”

With that, Luo Yuan attacked the array again, causing it to sway.

Mo Qingyun’s expression darkened and he ordered Wan Lianyun and others, “Wan City Lord, enter the array!”

“Alright!”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Wan Lianyun and others immediately entered the array, pouring essence energy into it.

With their essence energy, the Seven Star Killing Array’s power surged several times. Mo Qingyun formed a hand seal and sent it into the array.

Instantly, sword qi comparable to that of a Second Level Pill Mansion Realm powerhouse formed and attacked Luo Yuan.

“Array power has increased!”

Feeling the sword qi’s power, Luo Yuan’s expression changed and became cold. “Yu Qianyi, it’s you again. You helped them improve the array; I hate you…”

Luo Yuan sneered, “Even if the array’s power increased, it can’t stop me.”

“Break!”

Luo Yuan raised her sword and slashed the sword qi, instantly destroying it.

Mo Qingyun continuously controlled the sword qi to attack Luo Yuan. However, as a Sixth Level Pill Mansion Realm powerhouse, she was still unharmed.

Mo Qingyun frowned and thought, “This isn’t working. I need a plan.”

Suddenly, hoofbeats sounded rapidly.

Everyone’s expressions changed, knowing the Du family had arrived. If they joined Luo Yuan to break the array, what should they do?

“Du family has arrived!”

Mo Qingyun’s eyes lit up with a playful smile. “Mo Family, we’re back.”

Du Wangchuan revealed a cold expression and said arrogantly, “This time…”

But before he finished, Mo Qingyun interrupted him. “Senior Wangchuan, we’ve been waiting for you.”

Mo Qingyun said excitedly, “Let’s join forces to kill this woman. Afterward, we’ll thank the Jadeite Mansion.”

...

...

“Senior Wangchuan, do you think this boy is foolish? He says he’s been waiting for us.”

“Also, did he say he wants to join forces with us against that woman? Did he take the wrong medicine?”

“From what we see, this boy has many enemies. Besides us, he has others.”

“He’s sowing discord to make us hate that woman and use her against us. What a cunning boy.”

...

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, the Du family sneered but soon realized something was amiss. A terrifying aura pressed towards them from Luo Yuan.

Luo Yuan, a Sixth Level Pill Mansion Realm powerhouse. Such power was rare even in the Xia Kingdom.

They hadn’t expected Luo Yuan to be attacking their array. Moreover, Mo Qingyun’s words made them feel hostility.

Feeling Luo Yuan’s hateful gaze, the Du family felt uneasy. They were being tricked by Mo Qingyun?

“This despicable boy!”

Du Wangchuan was furious, gritting his teeth and saying, “This boy isn’t sowing discord; he’s using us as a tool.”

“Using us as a tool!”

Hearing Du Wangchuan, the others felt uneasy. Luo Yuan was a Sixth Level Pill Mansion Realm powerhouse; if she attacked them, their fate would be grim.

They realized the severity of the situation. They were in danger!

Luo Yuan looked coldly at the Du family, asking, “Are you this boy’s allies?”

The Du family looked coldly at Luo Yuan. She was filled with killing intent.

To her, the Du family members were already dead. After attacking the array for so long without breaking it, she was angry.

Now that the Du family had arrived, she could vent her anger by killing them.

“Senior, please listen to our explanation!”

Feeling Luo Yuan’s coldness, Du Wangchuan said fearfully, “We have a grudge with that boy. Please don’t fall for his trick; he’s using us as tools.”

“Senior, if you spare our lives, we’ll follow your orders and help you against the Jadeite Mansion.”

...

Following Du Wangchuan, other elders of the Du family pleaded with Luo Yuan. They were almost crying; if killed by Luo Yuan, they would die unjustly.

“Senior Wangchuan, you did well. As long as you keep her busy, help will arrive soon. We’ll deal with her together.”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, the Du family twitched and said angrily, “Boy, don’t slander us. We’re not on the same side as you; we don’t know you.”

After responding to Mo Qingyun, they pleaded with Luo Yuan again, their expressions pained.

But Luo Yuan ignored them. “Humph! A bunch of ants want to join me.”

Luo Yuan sneered, looking at the Du family with disdain. “Whether you’re his allies or not doesn’t matter to me; once you come here, you must die.”

For Luo Yuan, killing the Du family members to vent her anger was important. Also, she needed to kill them to keep her plan secret.

So, she decided to vent and silence them. Luo Yuan released killing intent and attacked the Du family.

“Senior, let’s talk!”

The Du family pleaded fearfully. “Just don’t kill us; we’ll do anything…”

But Luo Yuan responded with a cold sword and sharp blade.

Splat!

The Du family members were instantly killed without resistance. Seeing their kin slaughtered, the Du family felt sick.

They hadn’t expected to be killed by a madwoman after returning with such arrogance. The killer wasn’t Yu Qianyi or the Jadeite Mansion members but a mysterious madwoman.

The Du family felt regret. Why did they return?

After Luo Yuan’s frenzied attack, the Du family was wiped out except for Du Wangchuan at Second Level Pill Mansion Realm.

Seeing his kin slaughtered, Du Wangchuan roared in pain. “Mo Family scoundrels, you’ll die; we won’t let you off…”

Splat!

Before he finished speaking, Du Wangchuan was pierced through the chest and fell from mid-air.

“A madwoman!”

“Talking to a crazy woman who’s eaten vinegar for twenty years, the Du family is foolish.”

“A dog-eat-dog scene; it’s refreshing and satisfying.”

...

Seeing Luo Yuan slaughter the Du family, everyone in the Jadeite Mansion was relieved.

They looked at Mo Qingyun with admiration. With a few words, he made the Du family and Luo Yuan fight each other, wiping out the Du family.

Mo Qingyun’s move was ruthless. “Now it’s your turn.”

After killing the Du family, Luo Yuan returned to attack the Seven Star Killing Array.

Seeing her actions, Mo Qingyun said coldly, “Luo Yuan, do you think I can’t stop you?”

“Boy, if you have the ability, show it. Let’s see what you can do.”

Luo Yuan looked coldly at Mo Qingyun and attacked the array again.

“Once I break this array, I’ll tear you apart.”

Mo Qingyun sneered and said coldly, “Since you don’t accept my offer, I won’t be polite.”

Light Gate Soul, manifest!

Mo Qingyun summoned the Light Gate Soul without hesitation.

Seal Door, seal her!

With the Light Gate Soul, Mo Qingyun used his soul technique and attacked Luo Yuan.

Instantly, a miniature Light Gate rushed towards her.

“Break!”

Facing Mo Qingyun’s soul technique, Luo Yuan looked coldly and slashed at the miniature Light Gate.

But her sword didn’t damage it; it entered her body unimpeded.

Splat!

Struck by the Seal Door, Luo Yuan spat blood and looked pale. She also felt panic as her cultivation weakened.

Her cultivation dropped to Fifth Level Pill Mansion Realm in no time. “My cultivation is weakening, and my blood flow seems sealed.”

Luo Yuan felt alarmed and wary of Mo Qingyun. “How does this boy know such techniques?”

Mo Qingyun’s technique was unexpected.

Luo Yuan hesitated, wondering if she should continue breaking the array and killing Mo Family members. If Mo Qingyun had other tricks, it would be troublesome.

After some thought, Luo Yuan looked resentful and said to Mo Qingyun, “Boy, I won’t forget this. Next time I come, I’ll destroy you.”

With that, she left.

...

...

“Has she gone?”

“She should have.”

Seeing Luo Yuan leave, everyone in the Jadeite Mansion felt a sense of relief. Any force similar to the Jadeite Mansion would be terrified if attacked by a madwoman at Sixth Level Pill Mansion Realm.

“Luo Yuan will need about a year to return from Xuan Yue Palace.”

Mo Qingyun frowned and said, “So we need to develop a powerful force within a year.”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Wan Lianyun and others fell silent, looking solemn.

They knew Luo Yuan would bring many powerful experts. With the Seven Star Killing Array’s power, it might be hard to stop them.

Everyone knew Luo Yuan could invite Seventh and Eighth Level Pill Mansion Realm experts, possibly even Ninth Level ones.

Thus, developing a force to counter them within a year was challenging.

“A year is too short.”

Du Luo sighed and said, “Even with sufficient cultivation resources, it’s impossible to reach Luo Yuan’s level in a year.”

“Indeed!”

Hearing Du Luo, Wan Lianyun and others frowned.

Mo Qingyun knew their thoughts. He said, “Teachers, Wan City Lord, is there a place in the Xia Kingdom that’s always chaotic and filled with life-and-death battles?”

“Chaos?”

“Life-and-death battles?”

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, Wan Lianyun and others frowned, thinking.

“Ah, there is a place just like that.”

After some thought, Wan Lianyun and others brightened. Mo Qingyun asked, “Where?”

“Hundred Kingdom Battlefield!”

Wan Lianyun and others answered seriously.

“What is this Hundred Kingdom Battlefield?”

Mo Qingyun looked puzzled. Wan Lianyun said solemnly, “Young Master Mo, the Hundred Kingdom Battlefield is a place in the Daxian Dynasty where countries compete. Each country sends armies to fight.”

Wan Lianyun continued, “In the Hundred Kingdom Battlefield, each country’s army earns battle points by killing others’ armies, improving their ranking in the Dynasty.”

“Moreover, it’s an ancient relic with many powerful legacies.”

Du Luo paused and said, “So the Hundred Kingdom Battlefield is the most chaotic place in Xia Kingdom and Daxian Dynasty.”

“Hundred Kingdom Battlefield has three zones: True Essence Realm, Pill Core Realm, and Pill Mansion Realm. People of different cultivation levels enter different zones.”

U Qi added.

“Is it like that?”

Hearing Wan Lianyun’s words, Mo Qingyun brightened and had a plan. Qi Lian looked excited; the Hundred Kingdom Battlefield was perfect for cultivation.

Mo Qingyun said to Wan Lianyun and others, “Wan City Lord, stay in the Jadeite Mansion. Qi Lian and I will handle some matters.”

“Alright!”

Hearing Mo Qingyun, Wan Lianyun and others nodded.

Mo Qingyun and Qi Lian left the Jadeite Mansion. Qi Lian brightened, knowing Mo Qingyun’s plan.

Mo Qingyun was collecting the Du family members’ corpses killed by Luo Yuan. These corpses were valuable for cultivation.

With Mo Qingyun’s powerful soul perception, they quickly found the Du family members’ corpses. Sadly, Luo Yuan had crushed some weaker bodies into powder.

They found only Du Wangchuan and a few First Level Pill Mansion Realm elders’ corpses. But Mo Qingyun was satisfied.

After collecting the corpses, they returned to the Jadeite Mansion.

Qi Lian began seclusion and refined the Du family members’ essence blood. Mo Qingyun continued refining pills.

Time passed.

Ten days later,

Mo Qingyun finished refining all his medicinal materials into pills. He refined over twenty Sixth Level pills, four hundred Fifth Level pills, and thousands of Fourth and Third Level pills.

He didn’t refine First and Second Level pills. In his view, the Alchemy Alliance Guild could handle those.

Seeing the pill-filled jade bottles, Mo Qingyun smiled. He believed these pills would help the Mo family and Jadeite Mansion members enhance their cultivation.

He also refined five Two-Pole Breaking Realm pills for Du Luo and Wan Lianyun. After collecting the pills, he went to the assembly hall.

There, Mo Hongtian and others were discussing something. Seeing him, they smiled and said, “You’re here; we’re discussing how to deal with the Du family.”

“Deal with the Du family?”

Mo Qingyun looked surprised. Wan Lianyun said excitedly, “Three days ago, the Du family sent more people to attack the Seven Star Killing Array. We killed two Half-Pill Mansion Realm elders, and we’re discussing how to deal with them if they attack again.”

“Oh, the Du family came again?”

Mo Qingyun looked surprised and smiled. “I think they’ll be more cautious for a while.”

He handed the pill-filled乾坤bags to Mo Hongtian, Du Luo, and Wan Lianyun.

“What’s in these?”

They looked puzzled. Mo Qingyun said, “These are pills; distribute them to enhance everyone’s cultivation.”

Hearing him, they opened the bags. “Wow!”

They were shocked by the number and quality of pills.

“Did you refine these, Qingyun?”

Mo Qingyun nodded. He handed a jade bottle to Du Luo and Wan Lianyun.

“Two-Pole Breaking Realm pills!”

They looked excited, taking the bottle without hesitation.
