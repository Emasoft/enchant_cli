Seeing this scene, Mo Qingyun wore a look of helplessness and shook his head with a bitter smile, not knowing what to say.

It seemed that rumors were becoming increasingly absurd; no one knew how they had been distorted.

"Humph! What a dog-piss Purple Pupil Demon Lord!"

At this moment, when the storyteller's words had just fallen silent, a young man showed disdain and snorted coldly: "I hope I don't meet him; otherwise, I would like to add another soul to the list of my Crimson Blood Spear."

Upon hearing these words, Ling Luo's face darkened with anger as he glared at the man and said coldly: "A wild dog's fart, not afraid of being loud. If you meet the Purple Pupil Demon Lord, perhaps you won't even be able to let out a single fart."

"Hmm?"

Upon hearing Ling Luo's words, the young man's face darkened and he looked at Ling Luo with a cold gaze: "Boy, if you come over now to bow and apologize, then kneel and slap your face a thousand times, saying that the Purple Pupil Demon Lord is dog-piss, I might spare you a dog's life."

"Phew!"

Upon hearing the young man's words, Ling Luo's face showed even more disdain as he mocked him: "You, this stinky dog, are fit to give orders to a young master like me."

"Seeking death? Since you're tired of living, I'll fulfill your wish."

Seeing Ling Luo's disdainful words again, the young man's face twisted with rage as he gripped his red spear and charged at Ling Luo, saying coldly: "Boy, before I kill the Purple Pupil Demon Lord, I'll first use your blood to awaken my Crimson Blood Spear."

Chapter 226: It Was Really You (Third Update)

Blood Dragon Emerges from the Cave

As soon as the young man's spear appeared, a terrifying aura of essence energy burst forth from it, spreading a bloody scent and dragon might.

With the appearance of this bloody aura and dragon might, a fierce essence energy surged from the spear, forming an enormous blood-colored dragon shadow.

Roar...

As soon as the dragon shadow formed, it emitted a low dragon roar and twisted its massive body, charging at Ling Luo with extreme speed.

Bang bang bang...

Under the dragon shadow's movement, some tables and chairs around them were shattered into pieces, producing dull sounds.

Seeing this scene, the surrounding people's faces changed and they looked at the young man with awe.

At the same time, some people recognized this young man's identity.

"This... This young man is Zhu Feng. He ranks tenth among the Ten Great Kingdoms, and he's known as Blood Spear Zhu Feng of the Spear Kingdom!"

"What? He is Zhu Feng, said to have single-handedly killed three True Essence Ninth Level demonic beasts with his Seventh Level True Essence cultivation. His power is extremely bizarre."

"Not only that, it's said that the spear in his hand is a high-grade treasure weapon containing a drop of ancient dragon blood."

"With Zhu Feng being so powerful, it seems that the boy who offended him is doomed."

"Not just that boy; his companions will all be finished off as well."

...

Recognizing Zhu Feng's identity, the surrounding people began to whisper and looked at Mo Qingyun and his companions with sympathy.

Seeing Zhu Feng act on impulse, Ling Luo's face changed and he became tense.

From the combat power displayed by Zhu Feng at this moment, there was still a considerable gap between them.

This Zhu Feng wasn't someone he could contend with.

Fire Dragon Seal

Seeing Zhu Feng charging at Ling Luo, Mo Qingyun's face darkened and he raised his hand to summon the Fire Dragon War Seal, condensing it into a flame shield and smashing at the blood dragon shadow.

As soon as the flame shield formed, it emitted a shocking force of flames with an overwhelming power, pressing down on the blood dragon.

Bang!

Not long after, the blood dragon shadow collided with the flame shield and emitted a loud sound, bursting into dazzling light like a small sun.

At the same time, this blinding light burst forth with an astonishing wave of essence energy, sweeping fiercely towards the surroundings.

Bang...

Under this wave of essence energy, the entire roof of the inn was lifted off, leaving it in a mess.

Seeing this scene, the inn's owner immediately wore an expression of bitterness but dared not show any dissatisfaction.

There was no choice; the Mo Qingyun and Zhu Feng before them were not something he, a minor figure, could provoke.

"This... This young man is also very powerful. He actually easily withstood Zhu Feng's spear!"

Seeing Mo Qingyun take action, the surrounding people were immediately surprised and somewhat amazed by his combat power.

"Hmm! This young man seems familiar, as if I've seen him somewhere before!"

As soon as the person's words fell, someone immediately exclaimed in puzzlement: "I... I know who he is!"

Upon hearing this person's words, the surrounding people immediately wore curious expressions and inquired from him.

"Quickly say it; who is this young man? With his combat power, he definitely isn't an unknown figure."

"He's the Purple Pupil Demon Lord Mo Qingyun. I recognize his signature martial technique, Fire Dragon Seal, which he just used."

"What? He's that Purple Pupil Demon Lord who single-handedly wiped out thousands of True Essence martial artists outside the Nine Palaces Secret Treasure with his bare hands?"

"It's really him, the Purple Pupil Demon Lord. Zhu Feng might be in trouble this time; the Purple Pupil Demon Lord isn't someone to trifle with."

...

As Mo Qingyun's identity was recognized, the expressions of the surrounding people immediately became lively, their faces showing intense anticipation.

Two tigers fighting; such a scene was not easy to see. They were eager to see who would be the last one standing between Mo Qingyun and Zhu Feng.

Hearing the surrounding people's words, Zhu Feng's expression shook with a strong surprise.

He didn't expect that the young man before him was actually the Purple Pupil Demon Lord he had been looking for.

However, after a brief surprise, Zhu Feng looked at Mo Qingyun with a cold smile and said: "So you're the Purple Pupil Demon Lord. I was just worried about finding you, and now you've come to me; let's finish all of you off at once. Your bounty is quite substantial."

"Fear your abilities!"

Hearing Zhu Feng's words, Mo Qingyun looked at him calmly and replied indifferently: "Many people have wanted to kill me before, but they all died at my hands. You won't be an exception."

Upon hearing Mo Qingyun's words, Zhu Feng's face darkened and he said coldly: "You actually compare me to those useless people. Today, you're destined for tragedy."

"In my eyes, there's no difference between you and those people."

Mo Qingyun replied indifferently with a cold expression: "As for that bounty, you don't have the qualifications to claim it."

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, Zhu Feng's face darkened and he said with a sinister expression: "It's meaningless to argue. Since you're so confident, let's see who is stronger in a real fight."

Crimson Blood Dragon!

Zhu Feng summoned his martial soul without delay, intending to battle Mo Qingyun in his strongest state.

From this, it was evident that he was very wary of Mo Qingyun's strength and didn't take him lightly as he claimed.

Blood Dragon Extinguishing the Dragon!

After summoning his martial soul, Zhu Feng didn't hesitate and unleashed his martial soul technique.

Then, Zhu Feng charged out with a momentum like breaking through bamboo, rushing towards Mo Qingyun at extreme speed.

As soon as Zhu Feng's spear thrust out, a dense aura of blood burst forth from his body, making him seem like a dragon.

"Zhu Feng is so powerful. Under the aura of his martial soul technique, I feel my blood flow slowing down and breathing becoming difficult."

"Unsurprising that Zhu Feng can kill True Essence Ninth Level demonic beasts. With the combat power he's displaying now, even a half-step True Essence demonic beast can be challenged."

"From this perspective, the Purple Pupil Demon Lord's situation is somewhat dangerous. After all, those who went to ambush him aren't as powerful as Zhu Feng."

...

Seeing Zhu Feng take action, the surrounding people's faces changed and they unconsciously worried about Mo Qingyun.

However, while everyone was showing concern, Mo Qingyun remained calm and slowly drew out his Fire Silk Saber.

As he took out the Fire Silk Saber, a mysterious aura emerged from his body as if he were connected to heaven and earth.

This was the saber's momentum, a force of heaven and earth.

Moreover, as Mo Qingyun took out his Fire Silk Saber, a huge crimson dragon shadow appeared above him.

This was the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul!

As soon as the Crimson Flame Heavenly Dragon martial soul appeared, Mo Qingyun's aura rapidly increased.

In an instant, his aura reached the level of a True Essence Sixth Level cultivator.

At this moment, as Mo Qingyun's aura rose, a powerful force of flames emerged around him.

As soon as this force of flames appeared, it formed a flame storm within several meters around Mo Qingyun.

At this moment, Mo Qingyun released the three layers of fire's essence without reservation.

As the three layers of fire's essence were unleashed, some tables and chairs around him spontaneously combusted, stirring up agitated flames.

Seeing this scene, the surrounding people's expressions changed and they showed fearful looks.

"So... so powerful. The Purple Pupil Demon Lord's aura is even more formidable, wild, and domineering than Zhu Feng's!"

"It seems the news we heard wasn't accurate. The Purple Pupil Demon Lord's strength is powerful not just because of his demon eyes."

"Good thing we didn't provoke him earlier; otherwise, we would have been in trouble."

"Don't forget that the Purple Pupil Demon Lord's strongest point is his array formations. He hasn't used them yet."

"Without showing his array formation power, he's already this powerful. How formidable would he be if he showed it?"

"Sss..."

...

At this moment, after witnessing Mo Qingyun's strength, everyone wore expressions of awe and their hearts trembled.

At this moment, as everyone was in shock, Mo Qingyun finally took action.

Furnace Sun Mountain-Cleaving Saber

As soon as Mo Qingyun's saber fell, a terrifying force of flames burst forth from his Fire Silk Saber, enveloping it entirely.

Roar!

Then, a twenty-meter-long fire dragon saber aura burst forth from the Fire Silk Saber, wielding its claws and charging at the dragon spear shadow.

Bang bang bang...

As soon as the fire dragon saber aura appeared, a fierce force of flames surged around, igniting everything and turning it into an ocean of flames.

Bang!

Under everyone's gaze, the fire dragon saber aura collided with the dragon spear shadow and emitted a loud sound, releasing dragon might.

Sss...

In just this moment of collision between the two dragons, the dragon spear shadow turned into steam and dissipated in the sky.

And as the fire dragon saber aura dispersed the dragon spear shadow, it continued to strike Zhu Feng powerfully.

Bang!

Another dull sound.

As this sound rang out, everyone saw Zhu Feng's body being forcefully struck and sent flying by the fire dragon saber aura.

"No..."

Feeling the impact of the fire dragon saber aura, Zhu Feng's face showed pain and he exclaimed in fear.

Puh!

Then, Zhu Feng fell heavily to the ground, spitting blood and covered in burns, his aura weakening.

Fierce Bird Break

Seeing Zhu Feng injured, Mo Qingyun didn't hesitate and charged at him again, raising his saber to slash down.

After being struck by the fire dragon saber aura, Zhu Feng was already at his wits' end. Facing Mo Qingyun's slash, he had no strength to resist.

"No... don't kill me..."

Seeing the rapidly approaching saber aura, Zhu Feng's eyes bulged and his expression twitched in extreme fear.

Before he could finish speaking, Mo Qingyun's Fire Silk Saber sliced through his body and killed him.

After killing Zhu Feng, Mo Qingyun grabbed the Crimson Blood Spear he held in his hand and threw it to Long Yutian, smiling faintly: "Brother Long, catch."

"This spear is good; it suits me!"

Receiving the Crimson Blood Spear Mo Qingyun threw, Long Yutian wore a faint smile and showed satisfaction as he put it into his spatial bag.

At this moment, when Long Yutian put away the Crimson Blood Spear, a group of armored people rushed over.

When these people arrived, their leader walked out and coldly asked: "What's going on?"

"Reporting to the commander, there was a conflict among some people in my inn!"

Hearing these words, the inn's owner wore an expression of bitterness and reported to him.

"Oh?"

Hearing the old man's report, this commander scanned everyone with his eyes and then fixed on Mo Qingyun and his companions, coldly asking: "Is it them?"

"Hmm!"

Just as this commander's words fell, he frowned and showed a look of surprise. He took out an arrest warrant and compared it with Mo Qingyun's appearance.

After comparing, this commander was immediately surprised and then looked at Mo Qingyun with a cold smile: "Purple Pupil Demon Lord, it was really you. If you're sensible, surrender now."

Chapter 227: Zhang Tianming's True Strength (Fourth Update)

"Surrender?"

Hearing this commander's words, Mo Qingyun glanced at him disdainfully and said indifferently: "With just you?"

This time coming to Red Powder City, Mo Qingyun didn't plan on being low-key.

In his view, he wanted to establish a force of his own in the Hundred Kingdoms Battlefield. Red Powder City was just right for him to start his plan.

So, he decided to appear in Red Powder City with the most domineering attitude and establish his authority in a short time.

"Since you don't accept the wine, don't blame us for being ruthless."

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, this commander's face darkened and he said coldly: "Purple Pupil Demon Lord, everyone says how powerful you are. I Zhang Tianming don't believe it; today I'll let everyone know that in front of me, you Purple Pupil Demon Lord are just an ant."

"Get ready to move now and capture them."

Zhang Tianming's words fell, and he ordered his twenty or so guards to take down Long Yutian and the others.

After giving orders to his subordinates, Zhang Tianming wore a look of arrogance and said coldly to Mo Qingyun: "Purple Pupil Demon Lord, now I'll let you see my true strength. In Red Powder City, no one has seen me use my true strength; I hope you don't disappoint me."

At this moment, when Zhang Tianming's words fell, the surrounding people looked at him with a look of contempt.

"What true strength of Zhang Tianming's? A True Essence Fifth Level person daringly provoking the Purple Pupil Demon Lord."

"Idiot, even Zhu Feng couldn't withstand a slash from the Purple Pupil Demon Lord; he's making the Purple Pupil Demon Lord see his true strength."

"He's so arrogant mainly because he didn't see the scene where the Purple Pupil Demon Lord killed Zhu Feng."

"Ha, I'm eager to see what expression he'll have after seeing the Purple Pupil Demon Lord's strength."

"How could it be said, he'll probably wet his pants and have weak legs immediately."

...

At this moment, the surrounding people all wore expressions of disdain and mocked Zhang Tianming.

"Zhu Feng!"

When these words reached Zhang Tianming's ears, his expression twitched and he felt fear in his heart: "Zhu Feng? Could it be Blood Spear Zhu Feng of the Spear Kingdom?"

At this moment, as Zhang Tianming felt fear, his guards were already fighting with Long Yutian and the others.

"You came just in time; it's perfect for me to get familiar with my new weapon."

Seeing the guards charging towards them, Long Yutian wore a faint smile and took out the Crimson Blood Spear, saying coldly: "Now, let me use your blood to open my new weapon, the Crimson Blood Spear."

Dragon Elephant Heaven-Shaking Spear

Holding the Crimson Blood Spear, Long Yutian raised his hand and swept out a windfire wheel-like spear shadow towards the surrounding guards.

As this windfire wheel-like spear shadow thrust out, it carried a force of dragon and elephant, smashing towards the guards with wild and fierce momentum.

Bang bang bang...

Under Long Yutian's attack, several guards were forcefully sent flying, their armor instantly cracking and blood flowing.

One by one, they lay on the ground, breathing heavily with little air coming in; it seemed they wouldn't last long.

Thousand Illusions Cold Sword

Soul-Eating Demon Wheel

Ten Directions Spirit Sword Dance

As Long Yutian took action, Lu Fangliang and the others didn't hesitate either; they successively unleashed their powerful combat power.

Under Lu Fangliang and the others' attacks, these guards were like chickens and dogs; half of them were eliminated in an instant.

Seeing this scene, Zhang Tianming's face turned pale and a strong fear rose in his heart.

Too powerful; these people before him are too powerful.

More importantly, he saw the long spear in Long Yutian's hand; it seemed to be Zhu Feng's Crimson Blood Spear.

"That... that is the Crimson Blood Spear?"

Upon this discovery, Zhang Tianming's expression twitched and he looked at Mo Qingyun with fear: "Crimson... Crimson Blood Spear, how... how did it end up in his hands?"

"Zhu Feng? You mean that person just now?"

Hearing Zhang Tianming's words, Mo Qingyun's expression slightly changed and he said with a faint smile: "That guy attacked us just now, so I killed him. This Crimson Blood Spear naturally became my trophy."

Trophy!

Zhu Feng died!

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, Zhang Tianming's face turned even paler and his legs weakened.

Zhu Feng was killed by Mo Qingyun; how could he be Mo Qingyun's match!

From this, it seemed that Mo Qingyun's strength wasn't just rumors but truly bizarre.

Thinking of this, Zhang Tianming wore a look of panic and smiled at Mo Qingyun: "This... brother, just now was all a misunderstanding. I was just joking with you; hope you don't take it too seriously."

Joking?

Hearing Zhang Tianming's words, the surrounding people's expressions changed and they looked at him with disdain.

This guy was a typical big noise, small rain. Just now, his arrogant demeanor was truly domineering.

But in an instant, this guy turned into a coward.

"Brother?"

Hearing Zhang Tianming's words, Mo Qingyun glanced at him disdainfully and said with a look of contempt: "You're not fit to be my brother."

Disdainfully responding to Zhang Tianming, Mo Qingyun's face turned cold and he said to him: "Just now you said that for a long time, Zhang Tianming hasn't fought seriously. You wanted me to see your true strength and hope I don't disappoint you."

"This..."

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, Zhang Tianming was speechless and his expression showed extreme panic; he didn't know how to respond to Mo Qingyun.

How could he have known that Mo Qingyun's strength would be so terrifying, even killing Zhu Feng such a powerful person.

You see, Zhu Feng's strength was enough to destroy the entire Red Powder City; such a powerful person wasn't something Zhang Tianming could compare with.

Even if Zhang Tianming was powerful, he was only arrogant in a small city like Red Powder City.

If he had known it would be this way, even if given a thousand dares, he wouldn't dare to be arrogant in front of Mo Qingyun.

"Since you have nothing to say, let me send you on your way!"

Seeing Zhang Tianming silent for a long time, Mo Qingyun didn't have patience to argue with him and took out his Fire Silk Saber, slashing at Zhang Tianming powerfully.

As Mo Qingyun slashed, he released the three layers of fire's essence and a mysterious aura from his body.

"Don't... don't kill me!"

Feeling Mo Qingyun's terrifying aura, Zhang Tianming's expression twitched and he said with fear: "You... you can't kill me. My elder brother is the Deputy City Lord Zhang Tianzhi; he won't let you off if I die."

"Deputy City Lord, so what?"

Hearing Zhang Tianming's words, Mo Qingyun glanced at him disdainfully and said coldly: "Don't say your elder brother is just a Deputy City Lord; even if he's the true City Lord, today he can't save you."

As Mo Qingyun spoke, he slashed his Fire Silk Saber without hesitation.

The saber aura burst forth like a flood and pressed towards Zhang Tianming powerfully.

Clear Heart Sword Technique

Facing Mo Qingyun's slash, Zhang Tianming didn't hesitate and slashed back.

Then, he slashed out with his saber, a weak sword aura appearing on it.

The weakness of this sword aura was even less than the full power strike of a True Essence Third Level person.

This scene made Mo Qingyun somewhat surprised.

With such strength, Zhang Tianming dared to be so arrogant.

Sss!

When the sword aura and saber aura collided, the sword aura was instantly swallowed up by the saber aura and vanished in an instant.

Bang!

Then, the fire dragon saber aura powerfully struck Zhang Tianming and sent him flying.

Puh!

After landing, Zhang Tianming spat blood and his face turned extremely pale.

"How... how could this happen?"

Seeing himself defeated lightly, Zhang Tianming wore an expression of disbelief and exclaimed: "When the guards fought me just now, they said my sword energy was powerful enough to fight a True Essence Eighth Level person. Why did I lose in just one clash?"

True Essence Eighth Level could fight?

Hearing Zhang Tianming's words, Mo Qingyun shook his head helplessly and looked at him with sympathy, understanding the reason for Zhang Tianming's arrogance.

It was likely that due to Zhang Tianming's elder brother's status, some guards usually let him off during their spars.

And after losing intentionally, they would boast about Zhang Tianming's strength, making his confidence skyrocket.

It was laughable that Zhang Tianming believed it and took pride in it; truly pitiful.

Sympathetically looking at Zhang Tianming, Mo Qingyun didn't hesitate and slashed his saber to end his life.

"Boss, we're done!"

As Mo Qingyun killed Zhang Tianming, Ling Luo and the others also finished off those guards and came to Mo Qingyun's side.

"Let's go to the City Lord's Mansion!"

Seeing Ling Luo and the others arrive, Mo Qingyun told them and walked forward.

"To the City Lord's Mansion?"

Hearing Mo Qingyun's words, Ling Luo and the others wore expressions of surprise and looked at him with confusion.

Seeing their confused expressions, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and said: "It's time for Red Powder City to have a new master."
