“Mo Cang, don’t act so smug.”

Seeing Mo Cang boasting about others’ misfortune, Mo Xin’s expression changed and she said unhappily: “Those ghosts and spirits pose no threat to Qingyun.”

Mo Cang shrugged, smirking arrogantly: “Is that so? Then why hasn’t he come out?”

“Because…”

When Mo Cang asked this, Mo Xin was at a loss for words and didn’t know how to answer.

No matter what she said, Mo Qingyun not coming out was a fact.

After hearing Mo Cang’s words, Mo Feipeng and others, who were already tense, looked even more solemn.

Though his words were harsh, Mo Cang was not entirely wrong. If Mo Qingyun hadn’t encountered danger, he should have come out by now.

At this moment, He Qiansheng walked out from the crowd.

“Everyone, the entrance to our ancestral tomb has been sealed. Now I will announce the rankings of the first round.”

He Qiansheng chuckled and said: “After a moment’s tally, I have the rankings of the first round in my hand. Now I will begin to announce them…”

First place: Song Zihao, with 27 identity tokens.

Second place: He Xiao, with 19 identity tokens.

Third place: He Yuyang, with 17 identity tokens.

Fourth place: Mo Xin, with 14 identity tokens.

Fifth place: Mo Cang, with 10 identity tokens.

...

Tenth place: Lu Yong, with 6 identity tokens.

...

He Qiansheng announced the rankings of the first round one by one.

After announcing the rankings, He Qiansheng said to everyone: “Those who entered the top ten in the first round, rest for a moment and then enter the second round.”

At this moment, when He Qiansheng’s words had just fallen, Song Zihao came in front of the Mo family and said coldly: “I heard that the first among the younger generation in the Mo family, Mo Qingyun, has formidable strength. Why don’t I see his figure now? Has he not come out of the ancestral tomb?”

After hearing Song Zihao’s words, the Mo family members’ expressions changed and they looked somewhat unnatural.

Song Zihao’s actions were clearly stirring up trouble where there was none.

“Eh! Is it because they haven’t seen Mo Qingyun of the Mo family? Could he have perished in the ancestral tomb?”

“It’s possible. The dangers within the ancestral tomb are not small, and each family loses some of their younger generation every time it is opened.”

“The Mo family lost their first among the young, so they must be feeling quite upset about it.”

...

When Song Zihao mentioned this, the surrounding people all looked towards the Mo family.

Seeing those envious looks, Mo Hongtian and others’ expressions turned somewhat ugly.

However, Mo Kuide and others smiled faintly and said to the crowd: “Haha, I think you all are mistaken. The first among our Mo family’s younger generation is actually not Mo Qingyun, but my grandson Mo Cang.”

After hearing Mo Kuide’s words, everyone’s expressions changed and they looked somewhat dazed.

Mo Cang is the first among the young in the Mo family?

When was this decided?

Facing everyone’s surprise, Mo Kuide ignored it and said: “My grandson Mo Cang likes to be low-key and doesn’t care about these empty titles, so he didn’t compete for the title of first among the young. Coincidentally, Mo Qingyun is the eldest grandson of the clan leader and took on this title.”

“Clan Leader, did I say it right?”

After Mo Kuide finished speaking, he smiled slyly at Mo Hongtian, as if certain that Mo Hongtian would agree.

In his view, Mo Hongtian would definitely nod in agreement at this moment because it related to the reputation of the Mo family.

If the first among the young in the Mo family perished in the ancestral tomb, it would be quite a disgrace for the Mo family.

“This…”

Mo Hongtian looked hesitant and uncertain, not knowing how to answer.

“Eh! There’s a fluctuation at the exit of the ancestral tomb, could someone else be coming out?”

At this moment, when Mo Hongtian didn’t know how to answer, someone suddenly exclaimed in surprise.

Then everyone turned their gaze towards the exit of the ancestral tomb, looking curious.

Is there really someone else coming out from the ancestral tomb? Who could it be?

Under everyone’s curious and expectant gazes, a somewhat thin figure appeared before their eyes.

Mo Qingyun!

The person coming out of the ancestral tomb was Mo Qingyun.

Seeing this scene, everyone’s expressions changed and they were somewhat surprised at the result.

Just now, everyone was discussing that Mo Qingyun might have died in the ancestral tomb; they didn’t expect him to come out so soon.

This dramatic turn of events made everyone hard to accept all at once.

According to normal circumstances, once the exit of the ancestral tomb was closed, no one inside could come out.

“How is this possible? With the exit of the ancestral tomb closed, no one inside could come out. How did you get out?”

Seeing Mo Qingyun appear, Mo Cang said in disbelief.

Under Mo Cang’s words, others also looked curious and waited for Mo Qingyun’s answer.

“Is that so? I just walked to the exit and then came out.”

Mo Qingyun responded in a puzzled manner.

As for why he was able to come out, only he knew.

The traps and formations in the ancestral tomb were set by Blood Demon King Chilian, who could easily make Mo Qingyun come out.

The time for entering the ancestral tomb was set by Blood Demon King Chilian as well.

Therefore, when to open the exit depended on his mood.

When Mo Qingyun left the ancestral tomb, he was worried that Chilian would come out with him and cause others to be puzzled.

So, he let Chilian leave the ancestral tomb alone from another place and then they would meet up in Beimozhen Town.

After all, the people entering the ancestral tomb were young members of various families; if a Chilian suddenly appeared, it would be too obvious.

“Qingyun, you’re out! That’s great!”

Seeing Mo Qingyun come out, Mo Feipeng and others’ expressions turned joyful and they looked somewhat excited.

“Brother Hongtian, since your grandson has come out of the ancestral tomb, let him show his identity tokens.”

At this moment, He Qiansheng walked over and said to Mo Hongtian.

Then, Mo Qingyun took out the identity tokens he had obtained and handed them to He Qiansheng.

Sixty-seven!

Mo Qingyun’s identity tokens reached sixty-seven!

Seeing this result, everyone was shocked and somewhat amazed at Mo Qingyun’s performance.

So, the first place in the first round of competition would become Mo Qingyun?

“Brother Hongtian, congratulations! Your grandson is truly the first among the young in the Mo family.”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s performance, the heads of other families immediately congratulated Mo Hongtian.

The first among the young in the Mo family?

When everyone said this, they subconsciously looked at Mo Kuide and others with ridicule in their eyes.

Mo Cang is the first among the young in the Mo family?

Mo Cang is low-key?

Mo Cang doesn’t like to show off?

If this were true, why would Mo Qingyun’s performance in the first round be so much better than Mo Cang’s.

Under everyone’s mocking gaze, Mo Kuide and others’ faces turned red with embarrassment, as if they had eaten something bad.

Just now he said that Mo Cang was the true first among the young in the Mo family.

But now, Mo Qingyun proved with facts that he was the true first among the young in the Mo family.

This was a naked slap to his face.

Such a result, seen by everyone, seemed so ironic.

“Grand Elder, did you say just now that Mo Cang is the first among the young in the Mo family?”

At this moment, Mo Xin smiled slyly at Mo Kuide.

When Mo Xin asked this, Mo Kuide’s old face turned red again and he looked extremely embarrassed.

This time, his old face was completely lost.

Seeing Mo Kuide not speaking, Mo Xin didn’t say anything more and turned to look at Mo Qingyun.

“Qingyun, why did you come out so late?”

Mo Xin and others asked curiously.

“I encountered a problem in the ancestral tomb, which delayed me for some time.”

Mo Qingyun chuckled and fabricated an excuse: “Because of this, I also encountered a few good things.”

“Good luck? Good luck isn’t so easy to encounter. Don’t say you picked up a few wild grasses and call them good things.”

Mo Qingyun sneered, looking at Mo Cang disdainfully.

Hearing Mo Cang’s words, Mo Qingyun smiled slyly and took out the乾坤袋 (Qian Kun Bag) given to him by Chilian.

Then, Mo Qingyun took out the items in the乾坤袋 (Qian Kun Bag) one by one, including medicinal pills, spirit herbs, and weapons.

Seeing the items Mo Qingyun took out, everyone’s eyes lit up with envy.

“This… This is a high-grade third-tier medicinal pill, the Treasure Essence Pill. When True Essence Realm martial artists take it, they can enhance their essence energy cultivation.”

“There’s also the Refine Essence Pill. After taking it, it can refine the purity of essence energy in one’s body. This is a top-grade third-tier medicinal pill.”

“That’s a hundred-year-old fourth-tier spirit herb. The rich medicinal essence energy fluctuations are refreshing just to smell.”

“High-grade Mystic weapons, there are seven or eight of them. If True Qi Realm powerhouses hold such weapons, their strength will increase by at least thirty percent.”

“What kind of luck does this kid have to get so many treasures all at once?”

...

Seeing the items Mo Qingyun took out, everyone was envious.

As Mo Qingyun took out one item after another, Mo Cang’s expression became increasingly difficult to bear, as if he had eaten something bad.

Compared with Mo Qingyun, the good luck he encountered was nothing.

“Good kid, did you empty the entire ancestral tomb?”

Looking at one of Mo Qingyun’s treasures, Mo Hongtian almost couldn’t close his mouth and laughed at him.

Mo Qingyun’s good luck made his grandfather very happy.

“This… This is a lot of luck.”

Mo Hongtian asked, and Mo Qingyun smiled nervously.

Indeed, what he said was not far from the truth.

The乾坤袋 (Qian Kun Bag) given to him by Chilian did contain all the treasures in the ancestral tomb.

After a simple display, Mo Qingyun put everything back.

Soon, it was time to rest.

At this moment, He Qiansheng walked out and said: “The young people who ranked in the top ten of the first round, come over here.”

After hearing He Qiansheng’s words, Mo Qingyun and others walked towards the place he pointed to.

“The importance of the second round competition, I don’t need to say much. Because it relates to your family’s strength ranking in Beimozhen Town and the distribution of resources, I hope you can give it your all.”

Seeing Mo Qingyun and others walk out, He Qiansheng said solemnly.

“What does resource distribution mean?”

After hearing this, Mo Qingyun asked Mo Xin beside him in puzzlement.

“There are many plots of land in Beimozhen Town. Some produce various veins, and some are suitable for growing spirit herbs,” Mo Xin explained to Mo Qingyun. “But the distribution of these plots is based on each family’s ranking, with higher rankings getting better land.”

Mo Xin added: “The ranking of the families is decided by the points obtained in the competition among young people at the Town Meeting.”

“Is that so!” Mo Qingyun nodded.

“The rules are still the same. The family who gets first place among young people gets 100 points, second place gets 90 points, and so on.”

At this moment, He Qiansheng continued to explain the rules: “Also, if a family has multiple young people in the top ten, their points can be added together as the total points for the family.”

“Alright, now we will draw lots to match up opponents for the competition.”

After explaining the rules, He Qiansheng pointed at a box of lots beside him.

Then Mo Qingyun and others walked over to draw the lots.

“Number one!”

Looking at the number on his hand, Mo Qingyun’s expression changed slightly, indicating that he would be competing first.

Without hesitation, Mo Qingyun walked to the center of the stone platform.

Following him, a short and sturdy young man came in front of him.

This short and sturdy youth had decent strength, reaching the second level of True Qi Realm, with a more formidable aura than Mo Cang.

“He Family, He Yuyang!”

“Mo Family, Mo Qingyun!”

After exchanging greetings and introducing themselves, the competition began.

“Not good! He Yuyang has strong strength and a chance to get in the top three of this Town Meeting. Qingyun might have some trouble.”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s opponent was He Yuyang, Mo Hongtian and others’ expressions turned solemn.

He Yuyang’s strength was the second level of True Qi Realm, and not like Mo Cang who just broke through. He was very powerful.

For Mo Qingyun to defeat He Yuyang, it would be quite difficult.

In the center of the stone platform, in the competition area.

“Mo Qingyun, right? I’ve heard some things about you.”

He Yuyang looked at Mo Qingyun disdainfully and said: “I’m quite surprised that you could break through to the True Qi Realm so quickly, but with your first-level True Qi Realm strength, you’re not my match. Perhaps Mo Cang of the Mo Family could last ten moves against me.”

Mo Cang can last ten moves against you?

Hearing He Yuyang’s words, everyone’s expressions changed. This He Yuyang was quite arrogant.

Being the same level of True Qi Realm, he said that Mo Cang could only last ten moves against him.

Moreover, He Yuyang’s words had another layer of meaning: Mo Qingyun couldn’t even last ten moves against him.

“Is that so?”

Mo Qingyun smiled indifferently at He Yuyang’s words and said: “Maybe you don’t know, Mo Cang can’t even last ten moves against me.”

Mo Cang can’t even last ten moves against you?

Hearing Mo Qingyun’s words, everyone beside him changed expressions and looked somewhat shocked.

Mo Qingyun was even more arrogant than He Yuyang!

He said that Mo Cang couldn’t last ten moves against him.

Was he trying to show that his strength was stronger than He Yuyang’s?

While everyone was shocked by Mo Qingyun’s words, some people looked at Mo Cang with amusement.

Seeing everyone’s gaze, Mo Cang’s expression turned extremely ugly. These two guys were humiliating and belittling him.

“Mo Qingyun, He Yuyang, if I meet you two later, I will definitely humiliate you.”

Mo Qingyun gritted his teeth and clenched his fists, muttering darkly.

Neither Mo Cang nor He Yuyang paid attention to Mo Qingyun’s thoughts.

“Humph! Big talkers can all say big words, but true strength isn’t just about talking.”

Seeing Mo Qingyun even more arrogant than himself, He Yuyang’s expression turned solemn and he said coldly: “To let you know how big the gap is between us, when we fight next, I’ll only use one hand. If I use both hands, it’s a loss for me.”

He Yuyang will only use one hand?

Hearing He Yuyang’s words, everyone’s expressions changed and they were shocked.

He Yuyang was too arrogant!

“Use one hand?”

Mo Qingyun looked at He Yuyang in front of him and said arrogantly: “Since that’s the case, when we fight next, I’ll use one hand and one foot. If I use both hands and feet, it’s a loss for me.”

What?

Mo Qingyun will use one hand and one foot against He Yuyang?

Was Mo Qingyun too arrogant?

At this moment, everyone was stunned, frozen in place by Mo Qingyun’s actions.

“Did I hear that right? Mo Qingyun said he would use one hand and one foot against He Yuyang. Is he planning to commit suicide?”

“He’s not committing suicide, but he is too impulsive. It’s like giving the victory to He Yuyang.”

“Not necessarily, I’m quite curious about Mo Qingyun’s performance next. There might be some unexpected discoveries.”

...

At this moment, everyone was agitated and talking to each other.

“Use one hand and one foot? Hope you don’t regret it next.”

He Yuyang curled his lips, smirking coldly.

Mo Qingyun will use one hand and one foot against him? Can he win?

In He Yuyang’s view, Mo Qingyun’s actions were like giving him the victory.

“Qingyun, you’re being careless!”

Beside the competition area, Mo Hongtian’s expression changed and he sighed: “He Yuyang’s words were probably setting a trap for Qingyun.”

In Mo Hongtian’s view, in this competition that determined the status of a family in Beimozhen Town, He Yuyang wouldn’t be so reckless.

Therefore, when He Yuyang said he would only use one hand against Mo Qingyun earlier, it was actually setting a trap for him.

Originally, Mo Qingyun’s strength was lower than He Yuyang’s. Now he would only use one hand and one foot against him.

Mo Hongtian felt that Mo Qingyun might lose this battle.

“Humph! Overestimating himself, using one hand and one foot against someone else. I wonder how you’ll fight He Yuyang.”

Mo Cang sneered and said disdainfully.

“Using one hand and one foot against He Yuyang, even I wouldn’t dare. Mo Qingyun is really reckless.”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s arrogant actions, Song Zihao sneered and said disdainfully.

“Is he really Mo Qingyun?”

He Lingyu looked shocked, unable to believe that the arrogant youth in the competition area was the Mo Qingyun she knew.

This was too different from the weak-willed Mo Qingyun in her impression.

In the center of the competition area.

Seeing that Mo Qingyun was even more arrogant than himself and would use one hand and one foot against him, He Yuyang revealed a cruel smile.

“Mo Qingyun, since you’re looking for death, don’t blame me.”

He Yuyang said coldly and summoned his spirit beast.

Silkworm Wing Shadow Leopard, appear!

Under He Yuyang’s summoning, a shadow of a black leopard with silkworm wings on its back appeared above him.

Silkworm Wing Shadow Leopard spirit beast, a top-grade ninth-level spirit beast that could enhance the speed and strength of martial artists.

Silent Shadow!

At this moment, He Yuyang didn’t hold back at all and directly used a martial technique. His figure moved, rushing towards Mo Qingyun.

When He Yuyang took one step, his figure turned into a blur, moving at an extremely fast speed.

Moreover, when he moved this time, there was no aura fluctuation at all.

If he were to assassinate someone, it would be a terrifying thing.

“Mo Qingyun, die!”

In everyone’s daze, He Yuyang’s figure had already arrived behind Mo Qingyun.

Shadow Leopard Heart Grab!

He Yuyang stretched out his hand, and the terrifying essence energy on his palm rapidly formed a black leopard claw, attacking Mo Qingyun’s back.

Seeing this scene, everyone changed expressions and looked with不忍 (unbearable) eyes.

If hit by this attack, Mo Qingyun would probably be dead for sure.

“Qingyun is done for! He Yuyang’s attack is too fierce, if he resists it head-on, he will definitely be seriously injured.”

“He Yuyang is too strong. Even in a direct confrontation, Mo Qingyun has no chance of winning.”

“He Yuyang is one of the top three in this Town Meeting. Mo Qingyun dared to be so arrogant when facing him, he deserves his fate.”

...

There was a commotion beside.

“Not good! He Yuyang’s attack, Qingyun might not be able to withstand it.”

Mo Hongtian and others were worried, their expressions anxious as they clenched their fists tightly.

“Ahh!”

Mo Xin and the others even covered their eyes in worry, exclaiming anxiously.

Compared to Mo Hongtian’s group being worried, the people from He Family looked calm and said: “Haha, Yuyang is quite good. Even when facing someone weaker, he doesn’t hold back at all. If he can cripple this young man from the Mo Family, that would be great.”

For other families’ outstanding young people, He Family naturally didn’t want to see them grow up and become a threat to their family’s interests in the future.

“Originally, he wasn’t arrogant but self-important.”

Seeing that Mo Qingyun didn’t react at all to He Yuyang’s attack, He Lingyu’s expression improved a lot.

At this moment, when everyone thought that Mo Qingyun couldn’t withstand He Yuyang’s attack,

Mo Qingyun closed his eyes and put his hands behind him, taking a small step forward.

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s actions, He Yuyang sneered: “Want to dodge? Too late…”

However, before He Yuyang could finish his words, his expression froze and he wasn’t happy anymore.

Wind Blades!

At this moment, wind blades appeared around Mo Qingyun’s body. Each of these wind blades emitted a powerful aura comparable to the full power attack of True Qi Realm martial artists.

“What… What kind of technique is this?”

Seeing Mo Qingyun’s move, He Yuyang was shocked and quickly retreated.

But even so, in a short moment, he was hit by several wind blades, leaving wounds and bleeding.

At this moment, He Yuyang no longer had the previous confident look but was in a sorry state.

He Yuyang was hit back by Mo Qingyun and seriously injured?

Seeing this scene, everyone was stunned, feeling it so unreal.

Mo Qingyun really didn’t use both hands and feet to hit He Yuyang back seriously injured.

“Is that… an Art?”

Compared to some young people’s shock, Mo Hongtian and others’ shock was even stronger.

Art, this is the key to breaking through to Nascent Soul Realm, something they had always been unable to comprehend.

Now Mo Qingyun, just entering True Qi Realm, successfully comprehended an Art. This was too shocking.

“Art! Good kid, just entering True Qi Realm and comprehending an Art that even True Qi Realm martial artists can’t comprehend. Good, good, good, ha ha…”

At this moment, Mo Hongtian stood up excitedly. The joy was beyond words.

Mo Qingyun’s performance exceeded his expectations too much.

“Good kid, you’re becoming more and more mysterious.”

Mo Feipeng was also excited, his body trembling slightly involuntarily.

“Art? How is that possible? A young man in True Qi Realm comprehending an Art.”

Not only Mo Hongtian, but the heads of other families beside him were also shocked and stood up.

This kid has a terrifying talent. Although his spirit beast cultivation isn’t high, this kind of talent is too terrifying.

At this moment, some people who knew Mo Qingyun’s spirit beast couldn’t help but sigh in their hearts.

“Art…”

Hearing the reactions of those beside him, He Yuyang was stunned and couldn’t help but take a deep breath.

At this moment, He Yuyang subconsciously wanted to shout: Is Mo Qingyun still human?

True Essence Realm martial artists couldn’t comprehend, but Mo Qingyun comprehended it. Is there any justice in the world?

“Humph! Even if you comprehend an Art, without using both hands and feet, you’ll still lose.”

He Yuyang gritted his teeth and said with a grim expression: “The power of your Art is only comparable to the strength of True Qi Realm first level. Such an attack can’t defeat me.”

He Yuyang moved and directly rushed towards Mo Qingyun.

Shadow Leopard Phantom Kill!

At this moment, He Yuyang didn’t hold back at all and used his spirit beast’s divine technique.

He Yuyang rushed forward like a hunting black leopard, moving as fast as lightning.

Moreover, when he approached Mo Qingyun, his figure split into three, turning into three blurs.

These three blurs were indistinguishable from each other, reaching the point of being able to deceive people.

“Mo Qingyun, you can make me reach this step. You’re honorable even in defeat.”

The three blurs all smiled coldly and reached out to grab Mo Qingyun, leaving a blur.

Soul Heaven Seal!

Facing He Yuyang’s attack, Mo Qingyun looked at him calmly and opened his eyes.

Then three soul battle seals rapidly condensed and rushed towards He Yuyang like meteors.

Facing this terrifyingly fast, sudden soul battle seals, He Yuyang didn’t have time to react and was directly hit.

Ah!

Hit by the soul battle seal, He Yuyang let out a cry of pain and his body stopped.

Then the other two blurs also dissipated, revealing his true form.

When He Yuyang’s true form appeared, everyone could see that blood was oozing from the corner of his mouth and he looked pale.

“Get out!”

Mo Qingyun took a step forward, wind blades rising around his body and fiercely attacking He Yuyang.

Sssss…

Under the fierce attack of wind blades, in an instant, He Yuyang was hit by more than ten wounds and bled profusely.

At this moment, He Yuyang’s body was also hit by the wind blades and flew out of the competition area.

Seeing He Yuyang lying on the ground, seriously injured both physically and mentally, Mo Qingyun asked coldly: “Do you want to continue?”

Facing Mo Qingyun’s proud and imposing figure, He Yuyang felt a daze and his expression turned blank.

He lost!

And he lost under the condition that Mo Qingyun used one hand and one foot against him.

This result was a heavy blow to He Yuyang.

“I lost!” He Yuyang said with a bitter smile, his expression somewhat dejected.

“Qingyun wins!”

Beside the competition area, a judge announced Mo Qingyun’s victory.

Seeing this, Mo Qingyun walked to the side of his family and came in front of them.

“Young man, what secrets do you still have on your body?”

Mo Feipeng said excitedly and patted Mo Qingyun’s shoulder.

As for Mo Feipeng’s question, Mo Qingyun smiled faintly and didn’t answer directly.

“Sit down and rest for a moment.”

Mo Hongtian pointed at the spot beside him and smiled warmly.

Mo Qingyun’s performance was much greater than his expectations.

Seeing Mo Qingyun sit beside him, the people from other families all looked envious.

The key to breaking through to Nascent Soul Realm is comprehending the power of Art.

Now that Mo Qingyun had comprehended the power of Art, with Mo Qingyun’s help, Mo Hongtian’s chance to break through to Nascent Soul Realm would greatly increase.

“Mo Hongtian, you have a good grandson!”

At this moment, many family heads sighed in their hearts.

“Art! This kid can do it. We mustn’t let him go.”

Seeing Mo Qingyun in the crowd of the Mo family, Song Zihao’s expression turned dark and he gritted his teeth.

“He… He actually defeated Brother Yuyang!”

He Lingyu looked shocked, unable to believe it.

She knew He Yuyang’s strength very well; he was the top among the young generation in the He Family.

But even so, he was strongly defeated by Mo Qingyun, still under the condition that Mo Qingyun used one hand and one foot against him.

...

At this moment, when everyone was shocked by Mo Qingyun’s performance just now, the next round of competition began.

It was between Mo Cang and Lu Yong. Seeing his opponent was Lu Yong, Mo Cang revealed a disdainful smile.

Lu Yong was also in the top ten, but his strength wasn’t strong and only reached the first level of True Qi Realm.

At the beginning of the competition, Lu Yong summoned his spirit beast without hesitation and attacked Mo Cang with all his might.

Lu Yong’s spirit beast was a Flame Bull Ox, a ninth-level spirit beast that could be considered quite powerful.

Bull Ox Charge!

Lu Yong attacked with his spirit beast’s divine technique, as if he was determined to succeed or die.

When Lu Yong used his spirit beast’s divine technique, six bull ox shadows appeared around him.

These six bull ox shadows were like charging knights, carrying strong heat waves and fiercely rushing towards Mo Cang.

“Humph! This level of attack isn’t enough!”

Facing Lu Yong’s attack, Mo Cang sneered and raised his hand to strike.

Dark Tiger Devour!

Mo Cang’s palm gathered terrifying essence energy, forming a black tiger shadow.

The black tiger shadow let out a roar and rushed towards the bull ox shadows, devouring them fiercely.

In no time, the bull ox shadows were devoured by the tiger shadow and turned into its food.

“I concede!”

Seeing this, Lu Yong didn’t hesitate and jumped out of the competition area.

His strongest attack was easily broken by Mo Cang, continuing would only be self-degradation.

Seeing Lu Yong concede, Mo Cang raised his head proudly and threw a challenging glance at Mo Qingyun.

The meaning was clear: He Cang won more easily than Mo Qingyun.

Facing Mo Cang’s pride, Mo Qingyun didn’t respond but smiled slyly.

After Mo Cang and Lu Yong’s competition ended, it was Mo Xin’s turn to compete.

Mo Xin wasn’t very lucky and her opponent was He Xiao.

Seeing his opponent was Mo Xin, He Xiao’s expression turned dark and he said coldly: “I hate those who show off and the people around them. I don’t like that Mo Qingyun of your Mo Family, so I won’t hold back against people from your family. If you blame anyone, blame that Mo Qingyun who likes to show off.”

“Humph! Less talk and come on then.”

After hearing He Xiao’s arrogant words, Mo Xin frowned and said unhappily.

Then she rushed towards He Xiao like a fierce phoenix.

“Trivial skills!”

Facing Mo Xin’s attack, He Xiao sneered and revealed a cold smile.

Mountain-Breaking Axe, appear!

The Mountain-Breaking Axe is a top-grade tenth-level spirit beast with extremely powerful attack power.

When the spirit beast appeared, He Xiao’s aura rose sharply, like a giant axe breaking through the sky.

Mountain-Breaking!

Seeing Mo Xin’s figure approaching, He Xiao revealed a cold smile and used his spirit beast’s divine technique on Mo Xin.

Then a huge golden axe appeared in an instant and fiercely slashed towards Mo Xin.

Seeing He Xiao’s fierce attack, many people looked with不忍 (unbearable) eyes and pitied Mo Xin in the competition area.

If hit by He Xiao’s attack, Mo Xin would have to lie on bed for half a year at least.

“Xin!”
