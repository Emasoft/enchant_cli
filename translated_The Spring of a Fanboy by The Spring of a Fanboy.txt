Author: Zui Yin Chang Ge

Especially complex.

The lush trees suffered under the scorching sun, their leaves curling up from the heat.

A young man lying on the floor of an air-conditioned room half-closed his eyes, watching as the sunlight gradually moved toward him, much like a floundering salted fish that rolled over to avoid the sun that had just touched his arm.

This summer was too hot.

Wei Zhiren felt that he was even worse off than a salted fish in such temperatures.

Struggling, he took a deep breath, just about to roll over again, when he saw a notification pop up on his phone, which he had tossed aside.

Hengheng: @ZhirenZhiren, Goddess! Someone said we are chasing fans!

”. . .“ Damn?!

Wei Zhiren sat up abruptly.

. . .

Wei Zhiren, male, a well-known rich second-generation in B City.

Ambitious, capable, idealistic, and wealthy with a handsome face.

However, his ambitions, ideals, capabilities, and wealth were all manifested in his pursuit of stardom.

As for his face, he believed that no one in the world could match his idol's.

Even he himself agreed.

Wei Zhiren's idol was Xiao Cheng, an eight-year veteran of the industry, a dual award-winning actor with very few scandals, earning him the nickname ”Box Office Saviour.“

Tall, long legs, handsome face, and sweet voice.

Polite to everyone, never tormenting fans, following a route of aloof, taciturn, and ascetic acting.

He was a perfect character design.

Wei Zhiren had set his sights on Xiao Cheng since the latter's debut—of course, Wei Zhiren would never admit that he was initially attracted to Xiao Cheng's looks. He firmly believed that he had the foresight to see Xiao Cheng's potential and energy when he was still a nobody.

Wei Zhiren used to be a lazy and extravagant dandy. Thanks to his excellent older brother, he was uneducated and lived a wild life in B City, hanging out with a bunch of hangers-on, playing all day.

Later, he developed a crush on Xiao Cheng and did something that even his parents found astonishing.

He worked hard to support his idol.

To go from a lazy dandy to a well-rounded and industrious youth who could even help his family's company—how shocking was that?

From his parents initially thinking he was crazy for chasing stars to happily supporting him, one could see how satisfied Wei Zhiren was with the result, feeling a sense of achievement in being able to support his idol himself.

To clarify, Wei Zhiren, whose fan ID was ZhirenZhiren, was a well-known Xiao Cheng fan, a goddess in the fan community, and a godly rich man.

He was quiet like a chicken, aloof, and only posted ticket stubs, discs, or pictures of his purchases.

But!

Now!

Someone said that Xiao Cheng was chasing fans!

The quiet and aloof Wei Zhiren instantly became furious.

Rubbish! My idol wouldn't chase fans!

Anyone who dared to slander my idol should die!

Wei Zhiren directly closed the chaotic QQ group and opened Weibo, where the rapidly increasing number of fans and comments shocked him. Scanning through the heavily criticized posts on the homepage, his initial anger vanished, and he sneered, brutally posting two words.

ZhirenZhiren: Idiot. //@BaquanBaoxiao: New Information! A netizen claims that a woman seen with Xiao Cheng is @ZhirenZhiren, the famous Xiao Cheng fan with money, evidence as follows: [Comment Image] //@BaquanBaoxiao: According to insiders, a certain actor with the surname Xiao was recently seen entering and leaving a luxurious club with a mysterious woman, described as intimate. [Image][Image].

Wei Zhiren first forwarded and commented before opening those supposed evidence photos.

Xiao Cheng was indeed seen entering and leaving the club with a woman of good figure, their posture not exactly intimate. The woman in the photos was not seen from the front, but Wei Zhiren felt her back familiar.

The reason for the prying was the custom-made ring on the woman's hand.

That ring was identical to the one Wei Zhiren had posted on Weibo two months ago.

Wei Zhiren: ”. . .“

Damn it . . .

Wei Zhiren abruptly stood up, slapping on his slippers and stomping out, bursting through the room door with a face full of despair, ”Mom! Did you go see Xiao Cheng the day before yesterday!“

Wei's mother, who was downstairs watching a soap opera, looked up in surprise, revealing her face with a mask on, looking at her son upstairs, ”Yes, what's wrong? You like him so much, so I used connections to invite him out for dinner and got to know him.“

Wei Zhiren: ”. . .“

Get to know my ass!

Not my future wife! What dinner!

Wei Zhiren took a deep breath to calm down, his eyes falling on his mother's hand.

She was wearing the exact same ring as in the photo. Wei Zhiren had specially ordered and modified it months in advance to celebrate his parents’ thirtieth wedding anniversary.

But now, he wished he could cut off his hand.

”Little Zhiren, I think that guy is really great, no wonder you like him so much,“ Wei's mother was particularly happy talking about Xiao Cheng, her face glowing, ”Thinking about how you have grown up because of him, how could I not want to meet him?“

Wei Zhiren took another deep breath.

”Mom, Xiao Cheng is an actor,“ Wei Zhiren said solemnly, ”You being seen with him at dinner was caught by journalists, and now there's trouble.“

Wei's mother gasped in surprise, ”…What should we do? Can it be smoothed over?“

Wei Zhiren knew what his mother was about to say.

Wei's mother: ”How much money do you need? Just say it!“

Wei Zhiren: ”. . .“

See, he knew.

”No need for your money, just don't go see Xiao Cheng anymore,“ Wei Zhiren, exhausted, waved his hand and slunk back into his room.

Wei Zhiren never thought that his fan ID would become famous because of such nonsense—although he had been quite popular before.

BaquanBaoxiao: @ZhirenZhiren sis, you can't attack people just because you were exposed [smile]. Fans of the actor with the surname Xiao, what do you think about your idol chasing fans or chasing rich fans?

ZhirenZhiren: No feelings, Xiao Cheng doesn't chase fans, because I'm a guy. The exposure didn't even know my gender? For this reason, I'll say it again, idiot. //@BaquanBaoxiao: @ZhirenZhiren lady, you can't attack people just because you were exposed [smile]. Fans of the actor with the surname Xiao, what do you think about your idol chasing fans or chasing rich fans?

After posting this Weibo, Wei Zhiren felt that his homepage seemed to freeze for about three minutes.

Then, the notification of new messages in the upper right corner suddenly scrolled up.

Hengheng: Damn, Goddess Sanzhen is a guy?!

Cross-Dimensional Love for Chengcheng: ? [Black Question Mark.jpg]

Jenny's Xiao Cheng is so cute: Excuse me?

Everyone Here Is a Chicken: Then who is that woman in the photo? She's wearing the same ring as Goddess Sanzhen, is she your girlfriend?

ZhirenZhiren: @Everyone Here Is a Chicken: No, the ring is the anniversary ring I bought for my parents’ thirtieth wedding, so… = =

Jingjing Loves Chengcheng the Most: Holy crap… 66666666 I don't really understand the world of rich people.

Xiao Cheng's Girlfriend: Oh my God, Goddess Sanzhen… No, my lord, do you need a sister? A well-behaved one, who has gone to university!

Chengcheng's Little Belly Button: My lord, look at me, do you need a girlfriend? Someone who has studied and can earn money! Take me to meet Chengcheng! QAQ! I also want to have dinner with Chengcheng!

Wei Zhiren looked at the comments feeling somewhat downcast.

—He hadn't even had dinner with Xiao Cheng himself!


Chapter 2:
Wei Zhiren gripped the mouse, sliding it back and forth as he frowned at the number of comments increasing exponentially. After pondering for a while, he wrote an apology on Weibo.

Zhiren Zhiren: This time, it was my fault. I didn't expect it to happen. In fact, apart from checking up on Xiao Cheng when he first started his career, I had no other contact with him… I apologize to everyone in the fan circle. I'm sorry, Xiao Cheng, for causing you trouble. Sorry. @XiaoCheng

Wei Zhiren licked his lips and shuffled over to get a cup of water in his slippers. When he returned, he refreshed the comments on the Weibo post by impulse, only to have the water accidentally choke him, causing him to cough violently.

The culprit was calmly sitting on the spray-patterned screen.

Xiao Cheng: It's okay, you're very cute. [Smile]



In the end, he replied with an emoji: [doge]

Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha, are you insane?!

After sending it, Wei Zhiren regretted his words, lowering his head and thumping the table twice. He felt his reply was akin to that of an idiot.

According to the usual script, shouldn't he have thrown himself at his idol, using all his eloquent words to declare his love?!

He should have made his idol know how much he adored him!

Wei Zhiren stared at the computer screen, sinking into the soft recliner in utter despair, curling into a ball and feeling even worse than a piece of salted fish.

The phone on the table vibrated.

Wei SaltyFish grunted and pulled his head out of the soft recliner, reaching for the phone on the table.

There was an unread WeChat message from his childhood friend, who had grown up wearing the same pair of pants.

The main content was asking Wei Zhiren if he wanted to go out and have fun tonight.

Wei Zhiren thought his childhood friend was crazy. Clearly, he lived in the building next door, and he could have heard him from the balcony. Why send a WeChat message?

Feeling that his friend was insane, Wei Zhiren didn't go to the balcony to reply but instead tapped on the phone screen to respond.

Let's go, let's go, today I'm treating! Happy! Capricious!

Crazy Dance of Joy.gif

…

In the evening, at the C City Film City.

The production team was bustling, filming and recording the movie. Xiao Cheng had just finished his scene and retreated to the shade, lifting the long sleeves of his heavy costume, dragging a stool near the fan without blocking others, and finally sitting down.

His assistant quickly handed him some ice water.

Xiao Cheng took a sip, pulled out his phone, and saw Wei Zhiren's reply: [doge], unable to help but laugh.

Xiao Cheng was very handsome, not in the current popular sweet style, but with an overwhelming sense of rugged good looks.

His facial structure was rugged, with symmetrical features, bright eyes, and an upright posture, exuding a sharp military aura.

Now, with his eyes lowered, looking at the screen in his hand, the curve of his smile added a touch of softness to his sternness.

The assistant girl beside him wished she could be Xiao Cheng's phone, held in his palm, gazed at with such tenderness.

Xiao Cheng stared at Wei Zhiren's reply for a long time but eventually did not ruin his aloof persona, instead closing the current interface and flipping through his photo album.

This revelation started and ended in a baffling manner.

Xiao Cheng's divine essence was stable, not shaken in the least by this matter.

The fans’ attention had shifted to the fact that ”Zhiren Zhiren, the goddess, is actually a cute boy.“

Xiao Cheng had indeed had dinner with Wei Zhiren's mother.

And the outcome of that dinner had surprised Xiao Cheng greatly.

Xiao Cheng, the Emperor of Acting, paused, his fingernail gently tapping the photo on the screen, his smile becoming more evident.

He had searched for so long but was on the verge of giving up, only to find the person he sought.

Wei Zhiren.

Xiao Cheng silently repeated the name, swiped the screen to see another photo, and pursed his lips.

He felt that not finding the person for so many years could not be blamed on him.

After all…

He lowered his eyes to the extremely blurry photo of the youth, resembling a black monkey, then flipped back to the previous photo of the fair-skinned young man in a well-fitted suit, wearing gold-framed glasses, and exuding a cold demeanor. He never would have thought they were the same person.

The only similarity was their almond-shaped eyes.

—But back then, Wei Zhiren's dark skin could not be saved by his almond eyes.

Men change a lot after eighteen.

Xiao Cheng thought, it couldn't be blamed on him for not finding the person.

Back then, he didn't even know Wei Zhiren's name.

But it didn't matter now. He knew Wei Zhiren's name.

Not only did he know Wei Zhiren's name, but he also knew that Wei Zhiren had always been following him. And over the years, they had been in contact.

Xiao Cheng looked up at the sky.

The evening sun was slowly setting, the dark sky spreading, and the moon's shadow appearing in the cloudless twilight.

A row of birds flew far above, disappearing in an instant.

”Brother Xiao, dinner time!“ The assistant brought the production team's boxed meals and handed one to Xiao Cheng, the Emperor of Acting.

Xiao Cheng took the box, nodded at the assistant, and said, ”Thank you.“

The assistant girl smiled, squatting beside him to open her meal.

Xiao Cheng saw the dark circles under the assistant's eyes, swallowing his food, ”There's a night scene later. You haven't rested properly for three or four days. Go home after dinner. Call Zhang to replace you.“

The assistant was stunned, ”I'm fine.“

”Girls should take care of themselves.“ Xiao Cheng finished his small portion of food, ”If you don't go, I'll deduct your salary.“

The assistant girl was both moved and embarrassed, scratching her head lightly and smiling in agreement.

Xiao Cheng threw the food box in the trash, sat beside the production team's fan with his phone, hesitated for a while, and opened QQ, finding the person with the nickname ”Zhiren Zhiren.“

He had always been in touch with this famous netorare, not as Xiao Cheng but as a fan of Xiao Cheng's—a ”fan leader.“

Of course, the real person behind this avatar was Xiao Cheng's manager, who hoped Xiao Cheng would occasionally maintain contact with these wealthy, idle, and capable netorare in his fan group.

However, Xiao Cheng was always reluctant, and the manager had to struggle on his own.

Fortunately, Xiao Cheng rose to fame quickly, so he didn't need to manage his fan group himself.

It was only an occasional chance when he asked his manager for the avatar's account and password, sneaking into his core fan group to observe.

It was then that Xiao Cheng met ”Zhiren Zhiren.“

After that, the avatar was never returned to the manager.

The Emperor of Acting looked at the opened chat window, dazed for a while before sending a message.

Before he received a reply, the production assistant notified Xiao Cheng that he was needed for the next scene. The Emperor of Acting had to reluctantly put away his phone.

Chaos reigned in the club.

Several young men held bottles of alcohol, their faces flushed red.

None of them smoked, as they were considerate of Wei Zhiren, their friend.

Wei Zhiren didn't smoke and didn't like secondhand smoke.

The friends had asked why, but Wei Zhiren's answer made them feel their intelligence was insulted.

Wei Zhiren said, ”Because my idol doesn't smoke, I don't smoke either. You shouldn't smoke either!“

He also warned them that smoking was the first step to drug addiction and was harmful to health.

At the time, Wei Zhiren was holding a pamphlet with neatly written ”Idol's Words“ in large letters.

Wei Zhiren bit an apple, sitting aside, watching his friends wail, rolling his eyes.

Not everyone was like Wei Zhiren, with an excellent older brother and parents who didn't care whether he succeeded or failed.

These friends, who had grown up with Wei Zhiren, were now entering society, needing to interact with their parents and elders.

Since then, every time they met, they would huddle together, crying, saying things like ”Today we were taught how to be human again. Dog life is really tough“ and ”I wish I could be a quiet sea cucumber in my next life.“


Chapter 3:
Wei Zhiren felt that they were truly good for nothing.

He believed they desperately needed a charismatic male figure to serve as a guiding light and spiritual pillar for their progress.

However, every time Wei Zhiren opened his mouth, his companions would reject his recommendations with great alarm.

The reason was that they did not want to become effeminate like Wei Zhiren!

Feeling wronged once again, Wei Zhiren sat on the side hugging an apple, feeling that his companions were being unreasonable.

Where was he effeminate!

Was having the walls of his room plastered with posters of a handsome man effeminate!

He was merely decorating his living space with an appreciation for beauty!

Wei Zhiren angrily bit into the apple, pulled out his phone, and was about to browse pictures of the handsome man to calm down.

Then he saw a message from the little black monkey.

Wei Zhiren had a fairly good impression of this escort, who occasionally sent him two private photos of Xiao Cheng. He did not say much and did not ask Wei Zhiren for extra money or effort simply because he was rich—although he did indeed contribute money whenever there were activities in the fan circle.

However, volunteering and being asked were different.

Of course, the most important thing was that the little black monkey was male, just like Wei Zhiren, and he knew that Wei Zhiren was not a girl.

Therefore, they could talk freely without any reservations, chatting about anything from the north to the south. Thus, in the fan circle, Wei Zhiren chatted the most with this little black monkey.

Little Black Monkey: Finally unmasked?

Zhiren Zhiren: [White Eye][White Eye] It doesn't matter. Let everyone know that that so-called Eighth Ring is an idiot.

Xiao Cheng, after ending a day of filming, lay in the hotel room, closing his eyes to rest.

His phone on the nightstand vibrated.

Xiao Cheng opened his eyes, reached for the phone, and smiled at the reply.

Little Black Monkey: Interview you about your transition from goddess to godly man?

Zhiren Zhiren: Showboasting and running away, that's really exciting!

Little Black Monkey: …

Zhiren Zhiren: Did you see! Xiao Cheng flipped my cards!

Zhiren Zhiren: Listen carefully, if Xiao Cheng can continuously flip my cards, even if he strips me down to nothing, I'll be willing!

Xiao Cheng looked at this message and sighed lightly.

Foolish child, your mother has already stripped you down to nothing.

I even know about the time you wet the bed at eight years old and urinated a map of China.

The Acting Emperor was particularly pleased, but he did not say it.

Zhiren Zhiren: Compared to this, there's something I don't know whether I should say or not.

Little Black Monkey: Better not say it.

Zhiren Zhiren: No, I have to say it! My Cheng hasn't posted a selfie in half a month!

Zhiren Zhiren: Ah, without Cheng Cheng, I'll die of thirst!

Zhiren Zhiren: [Dried Fish.jpg]

Xiao Cheng paused, stared at the message for a long time, and finally got out of bed, walked to the balcony, adjusted his angle, took a photo of a peaceful life, specially retouched it, and then uploaded it to Weibo.

Xiao Cheng: Heard you miss me [Smiling]. [Picture]



Perhaps because he had finally found the person he had been searching for, that joy and happiness were carried into his dream.

He dreamed of Wei Zhiren.

Ten years ago's Wei Zhiren.

Yes, the first time he met Wei Zhiren was ten years ago.

It was all old history, but Xiao Cheng remembered it vividly.

Back then, after being obedient for eighteen years, Xiao Cheng finally entered his delayed rebellious phase. Due to his dissatisfaction with his family wanting to marry him off early, eighteen-year-old Xiao Cheng ran away from home.

Not only did he run away, but he did not even take any money.

Without money, without a phone, clutching only his ID card, he ran out on a hot summer evening.

Xiao Cheng's family was among the unmentionables in City B, having received military education since childhood and having no experience with rebellion.

So, the first-time runaway Xiao Cheng encountered the experienced runaway Wei Zhiren.

At that time, Xiao Cheng had been hungry for two days, sitting in the shadow of a flower bed under a streetlight, considering whether to make up with his family.

Just then, he encountered Wei Zhiren, who had run out of the house after failing yet another exam, too scared to face his father's iron fists.

Wei Zhiren stood under the bright streetlight, his skin sunburned like stir-fried rice with too much soy sauce, wearing a large tank top and a pair of oversized basketball shorts, his feet clad in worn-out running shoes, and holding a basketball.

He looked at Xiao Cheng, who was sitting by the flower bed, bearded like a homeless man, and glanced at his clothes.

Then he smiled at Xiao Cheng and showed his teeth, ”What a coincidence, are you also running away from home?“

Xiao Cheng: ”…“

Wei Zhiren did not mind Xiao Cheng's silence at all. He walked over and sat next to Xiao Cheng, putting the basketball aside, ”You don't often come out.“

Xiao Cheng thought to himself, why would I come out often, lying in bed at home isn't good?

Wei Zhiren said seriously, ”You can't do this. You can come out without a phone, without clothes, without a bank card, but you must bring some loose change.“

Xiao Cheng was too hungry to talk.

The bored Wei Zhiren lectured the stranger beside him, ”Bring loose change, go to any store on the roadside, call someone who will accept you for five cents, stay out for ten days or half a month before going back.“

He sounded very experienced.

Xiao Cheng's stomach rumbled.

Wei Zhiren laughed when he heard it. He felt in his pocket, handed the basketball to Xiao Cheng, ran to a nearby convenience store, bought two boxes of instant noodles, boiled them, and brought them back.

”Eat.“ Wei Zhiren slurped on his noodles, ”Finish eating and go back. Next time you come out, make sure you're well-prepared. Otherwise, you could sneak back and take something before coming out, right? Don't shortchange yourself.“

Xiao Cheng looked at the instant noodles in his hand, feeling that his hunger had made him lose his mind.

He actually thought Wei Zhiren was right.

Later, Wei Zhiren decided to demonstrate by example for Xiao Cheng and ran to the convenience store to call his companions one by one.

After making the calls, Wei Zhiren said tearfully that his companions were afraid of being beaten by their fathers and dared not protect him.

After looking at each other for a long time, Wei Zhiren dragged Xiao Cheng to sleep on the bridge for the night.

—Overall, it was much better than the two days Xiao Cheng spent sleeping on the street. At least Wei Zhiren chose a place where they could feel the cool breeze of a summer night.

Xiao Cheng watched Wei Zhiren skillfully find two large plastic sheets to lay on the ground, marveling at his experience.

The next morning, when he woke up, Wei Zhiren yawned and pointed the way to the public toilet for Xiao Cheng, then gave him the remaining loose change in his pocket.

Wei Zhiren looked at the disheveled new companion, ”I'm going back, you should also go back when you run out of money, staying out isn't a good idea, you can't go work at a construction site, right?“

”Hey.“ Wei Zhiren called out to Wei Zhiren, who was about to leave. He asked, ”What's your name?“

The soy-colored teenager smiled again and showed his teeth, ”I'm called Red Scarf.“

Xiao Cheng: ”…“

F*cking Red Scarf.

Xiao Cheng watched Wei Zhiren


Chapter 4:
Xiao Cheng looked at the director and nodded.

The director, seeing his nod, asked again, ”My old friend asked me to inquire if you have any thoughts after the contract expires?“

Xiao Cheng pondered for a moment, not wanting to rule out any possibilities, and said, ”Not for the time being.“

The director, hearing his words, spoke with deep concern, ”We have known each other for so many years; be honest now. Your contract with Light and Shadow Media, which is a notorious death trap, is not a secret in the industry. Don't be too sentimental about old ties; who doesn't strive for higher ground?“

Hearing this, Xiao Cheng shook his head without adding much, simply saying, ”I understand. Thank you, director.“

The director, wanting to say more, saw Xiao Cheng's calm demeanor and finally sighed, ”Consider it well.“

Xiao Cheng merely nodded, indicating his understanding.

Seeing this attitude, the director thought it best not to press further.

Although Light and Shadow Media had been Xiao Cheng's longtime employer, they had always treated him harshly.

Otherwise, with Xiao Cheng's capabilities, he would not have achieved only so much in eight years.

However, as neither party had indicated their stance, he, as an outsider, could only shake his head and sigh.

...

Wei Zhiren slept until the sun was high in the sky.

After checking the time and the date, he sprang up, washing and changing clothes in a hurry.

Wei Zhiren's public image was always quite respectable—especially in his own company.

Wei Xianyu put on a suit and tie, picked up the gold-rimmed glasses lying beside him, and put them on. When he looked at himself in the mirror, the foolish and sweet aura of a recluse vanished, revealing the image of a standard social elite.

Wei Zhiren straightened his face in the mirror, adjusted his expression, ensuring that his cold look could easily make a child cry, before he left the room in high spirits.

Wei Zhiren began contemplating the雏形 of his career while in university, and after securing investment from his brother, the company had been on the rise for eight years.

Weicheng Cultural Media was an enterprise that Wei Zhiren had established himself, not large in scale but affiliated with his brother's group.

He managed the day-to-day operations, while his brother dealt with the mess he inadvertently caused.

Yes, Wei Zhiren might be a slacker, but he was also a successful slacker.

And a CEO.

Thinking about it, it did feel rather appealing.

Wei Zhiren felt it was appealing too, after all, combining his and his idol's traits, it was like a ten-thousand-word story of a domineering CEO falling for a charismatic actor.

However, Wei Zhiren had the heart of a thief but not the courage. He dared not really take in his idol, but he could sneak in his bias during the company's establishment.

That bias was the company's name.

Weicheng, Wei Cheng, knowing how much Wei Zhiren admired him, his brother Wei Ziming and his friends knew this inside joke. And every time Xiao Cheng had a new project, Wei Zhiren would cry and plead, regardless of profit or loss, insisting on investing.

Wei Zhiren stepped out of the elevator with a cold expression, only to be greeted by his secretary, who told him, ”Mr. Wei, Mr. Chairman is calling for you.“

Mr. Chairman referred to his brother, the genius who had cheated his way through school.

Wei Zhiren rushed to the empty office next to his, and as he opened the door, he saw his handsome and dashing brother sitting on the sofa in the office.

Seeing his secretary leave after brewing his tea, Wei Zhiren instantly dropped his cold expression, grinning at his brother, ”Xiaoming, what brings you here today?“

Wei Zhiren's childhood trauma, his brother, Wei Ziming, raised an eyebrow, ”Do you not want to call me brother properly?“

”No, no, I just find Xiaoming more亲切!“ Wei Zhiren said earnestly.

Wei Ziming hmphed, picked up the folder on the table, tapped Wei Zhiren's head, and handed it to him, ”Take a look.“

Wei Zhiren was taken aback, flipped through the folder, and then slammed it shut.

This was a plan on how to poach Xiao Cheng from Light and Shadow Media.

Wei Ziming, watching Wei Zhiren's bewildered expression, calmly said, ”Xiao Cheng's contract with Light and Shadow Media is about to expire. They have always treated him poorly. If his old employer doesn't make a move, Xiao Cheng will most likely leave.“

”Coincidentally, your birthday is approaching.“ Wei Ziming took a sip of tea, ”Whether you can pull it off is up to you. If you fail, you won't get a birthday gift.“

Snap out of it, Wei Zhiren thought, flipping through the folder written by his brother, hugging Wei Ziming and wailing in gratitude.

”Brother! You are really my brother!“

Wei Ziming kicked him, ”Of course, I'm your brother.“

Wei Zhiren kissed his brother on the cheek, dancing through the door between the two offices back to his own, opening his phone and joyfully announcing this great news in his friends’ group chat!

ZhirenZhiren: I'm telling you!

ZhirenZhiren: Xiao Cheng is mine soon!

The author has something to say: The next speaker is Mr. Red Scarf.

Wei Zhiren: He's so——————cute [Manual Heart.jpg]

...



Otherwise, she wouldn't have sought out Xiao Cheng at just this time.

Although she was indeed curious about the actor her son had liked for so long.

But after this meal, her impression of Xiao Cheng was very favorable.

Mothers always enjoy hearing others praise their children.

Especially when the handsome Xiao Shadow Emperor sincerely praised both of her sons, it made her very happy.

So, Wei Zhiren's mother had no qualms about selling him out and left happily.

It's just about chasing stars, she thought.

Having floated in the business world with her husband for decades, she considered her eyes quite discerning.

Xiao Cheng, the young man, was handsome and polite, considerate and intelligent. Though he spoke little, every word made her feel happy, and his demeanor was upright, clearly not a bad person.

Seeing the walls of Wei Zhiren's room plastered with Xiao Cheng's posters and stills, Wei Zhiren's mother felt there was nothing wrong with it.

Right, nothing wrong!

It was better than letting Wei Zhiren hang out with that bunch of ruffians.

Thinking of this, Wei Zhiren's mother felt even more satisfied with Xiao Cheng.

...

Wei Zhiren felt a bit lonely.

Because his friends hadn't paid him any attention.

Wei Zhiren looked at the folder with the plan and checked the time, deciding to go to the cafeteria to eat before returning.

Weicheng's benefits were excellent, providing breakfast and lunch and accommodations, with activities and prizes during festivals.

Although they often worked overtime, the company covered dinner and midnight snacks during those times.

The cafeteria contracted by Weicheng was outstanding. Employees from other companies in the building often came up to enjoy the cafeteria's food—it was cheap, delicious, and good value.

Such good benefits were rare in all of B City, which made the employees work hard.

Of course, these welfare measures weren't Wei Zhiren's idea; it was his brother's doing.

His elder brother, Wei Ziming, had taught him how to manage a small company step by step and assigned capable employees to him.

When Wei Zhiren was still in university, clueless and naive, he wouldn't have been able to retain people without excellent benefits and generous treatments.

His elder brother had worried a lot about his incompetent younger brother.

But now, he could rest easy, for Wei Zhiren was his brother, with exceptional talent, and leaving him to his own devices wouldn't cause any trouble.

Wei Zhiren walked to the cafeteria with a cold expression, nodded at the employees who looked at him, and took a few cream cakes, sitting at a corner.

Yes, indeed, the CEO Wei Zhiren, who was a foolish and sweet recluse fan in his heart, was also a sweet tooth.

This setting was simply girly.

Wei Zhiren, who didn't acknowledge his girly side, ate the whole plate of sweets with a cold expression and went to the beverage section for a vanilla milkshake.

Had you ever seen such a cold, handsome, and charming girl?

Wei Zhiren chuckled.

Perhaps because it was lunchtime, Wei Zhiren's friends started emerging one by one, having been released from their work.


Chapter 5:
The neighbor with the oversized pants: Ah, my heavens, Wei Zhiren, are you finally going to make your move?

The Europeans are all scoundrels: I remember someone once said they had only a pure admiration and appreciation for Xiao Cheng.

A worthless dog: Young master, do you want me to prepare some kidney essence for you?

Sea Cucumber: +1 Brother, Father is quite worried about you, my child.

Wei Zhiren looked at the messages in the group and slowly put down the cup filled with fragrant milkshake in his hand.

Zhiren Zhiren: You guys are really vulgar!

Zhiren Zhiren: Is there anything in your minds besides trashy garbage?!

Zhiren Zhiren: I've told you so many times, the god is only to be admired from afar, not to be trifled with!

The Europeans are all scoundrels: [White eye][White eye]

A worthless dog: Huh! Aren't you going to sleep with Xiao Cheng? Otherwise, how could you say Xiao Cheng belongs to you?

Vulgar!

Wei Zhiren looked around, gulped down the milkshake in one go, maintained his unattainable and elite persona, and turned to leave the cafeteria.

And with a cold expression, as if deep in thought, he lowered his eyes, tapping his phone screen one by one.

Zhiren Zhiren: Who the hell said I was going to sleep with Xiao Cheng?!

Sea Cucumber: If you're not sleeping with him, then what are you planning to do?

Zhiren Zhiren: Silly child, I can take care of him!

The neighbor with the oversized pants: Question mark question mark question mark.

Wei Zhiren returned to his office, curled up on the sofa, and told his buddies about the business plan his brother had given him.

And he happily expressed that he believed the plan his brother had personally handled had at least a sixty percent chance of success!

His buddies knew of Wei Ziming's capabilities and did not doubt it.

The Europeans are all scoundrels: That's not bad, but can you control yourself after getting close to Xiao Cheng?

Zhiren Zhiren: What?

Sea Cucumber: His meaning is that you should be honest about your body.

Sea Cucumber: There's no need to say that you were going to masturbate to his poster, but what are you going to do when you meet him in person?

Zhiren Zhiren: What happened to masturbating?! You sound like you've never done it before!

Sea Cucumber: I indeed never masturbated to Xiao Cheng's poster.

The Europeans are all scoundrels: No, you… really aren't going to sleep with him?

Not sleeping with him! We are not sleeping with him!

Can't you think of something pure! noble! refined!

Wei Zhiren really wanted to throw his phone.

Is Your Yi Da: Hey, it's not that I'm saying so, Wei Zhiren, but our company is also in this business. I think it's pretty difficult for you to get Xiao Cheng.

Is Your Yi Da: Many companies are eyeing him now, all ready to strike, but you're just a small company… unless your brother personally handles it, otherwise, no matter how great the business plan is, it won't matter.

Zhiren Zhiren: I know what you're saying, Da Zi, but I still have to try, right?

After all, directly giving up is different from struggling but failing to snatch him.

Wei Zhiren looked at the business plan on his desk and felt that he still had a slight chance.

Is Your Yi Da: Then wish you good luck, I'll buy a few boxes of kidney essence with Dog Brother and the others to prepare for you, in case you can't control yourself.

Wei Zhiren choked.

Zhiren Zhiren: Are you done yet? Get lost!

Throwing the phone aside, Wei Zhiren felt that staying in that group was like being an unstained white lotus rising from the mud.

A truly upright, pure, righteous, and beautiful (?) president like him was rare.

Look at that neighbor with the beer belly!

And look at that baldhead downstairs!

And that beer-bellied and baldhead upstairs!

It was simply blinding.

Wei Zhiren drank a cup of cold water to calm down and carefully looked over the business plan.

It was no secret that Xiao Cheng was unhappy at Light and Shadow Media.

Not unhappy, but mistreated, and Xiao Cheng was bound by his contract and could not leave.

Xiao Cheng was discovered by a talent scout at Light and Shadow and signed a ten-year contract with Light and Shadow Media right away.

When he first signed, Xiao Cheng had no foundation in acting and spent two years at Light and Shadow's training camp before officially debuting.

After his debut, he became a sensation and continued to rise, never slipping up.

Most importantly, Xiao Cheng himself worked hard and never got involved in any scandals, making him a model worker in the industry.

A money tree.

That was how the industry professionals saw Xiao Cheng's rise.

But not long after, news of Light and Shadow withholding Xiao Cheng's contract modification leaked out.

What did this mean?

This meant that Xiao Cheng, who held a top position in the domestic industry, could only enjoy the resources of a newcomer, receive the compensation and salary of a newcomer on the company side.

When this news broke, many companies were in an uproar and threw offers at Xiao Cheng.

Unfortunately, none of them succeeded.

However, Xiao Cheng was also quite capable. Without resources from the company, he and his talent scout worked hard to secure resources on their own.

By now, even screenwriters and directors were bringing their scripts to him.

At first, Wei Zhiren could not figure out why Light and Shadow's boss was treating this money tree so poorly, and he could not find any reason Xiao Cheng had offended anyone or done anything wrong.

Later on, combining gossip and insider information, Wei Zhiren pieced together a small part of the truth.

The problem still lay with Light and Shadow's boss.

It was common knowledge among this circle of investors that Light and Shadow's boss had designs on Xiao Cheng.

Wei Zhiren knew that Light and Shadow's boss could never get rid of Xiao Cheng.

In fact, if it weren't for Light and Shadow's boss being powerless against Xiao Cheng, Wei Zhiren would have long ago gone to trouble him with a brick.

As for how Xiao Cheng managed to protect himself, Wei Zhiren really had no idea.

But with a little bit of speculation, he figured out what was going on with the contract mess Light and Shadow had cooked up.

—Nothing more than using money and resources as a threat to force someone's hand.

Unfortunately, the threat didn't work, and Xiao Cheng and his talent scout were left with bruised faces.

Xiao Cheng had deep conflicts with his former company, which was good news for Wei Zhiren and other companies trying to poach him.

Wei Zhiren put down the business plan, looked at the computer screen, thought for a moment, and decided to try to seek some external help.

External help related to Xiao Cheng.

Wei Zhiren opened his QQ.

Xiao Cheng happened to be off set and saw Wei Zhiren's message as soon as he sat down.

He raised his eyebrows, flipped through his phone, and sent Wei Zhiren the set photos taken by his assistant earlier.

Zhiren Zhiren: Monkey monkey monkey, I need to talk to you.

Little Black Monkey: [Image][Image]

Little Black Monkey: ?

Zhiren Zhiren: Emma, my Cheng is still as handsome as ever! Did you go to visit him?

Little Black Monkey: Yeah.

Zhiren Zhiren: Monkey, I have a serious question for you.

Zhiren Zhiren: Are you very familiar with Xiao Cheng?

When Xiao Cheng saw this message, he paused, pursed his lips, and lightly rubbed his fingers on the screen.

After a while, he replied:

Little Black Monkey: Sort of.

Seeing this reply, Wei Zhiren felt more confident.

Zhiren Zhiren: Do you know how Xiao Cheng feels about Light and Shadow?

Zhiren Zhiren: Even if he's my god, I think it's pretty stupid for him to stay there for ten years.

Little Black Monkey: …

Zhiren Zhiren: His contract period is ending, right? Do you have any insider information you can reveal?

Xiao Cheng looked at this message and clicked his tongue.

Actually, Xiao Cheng was planning to quit acting after his contract ended and just rest.

After all, he had earned enough money and fame, and he wouldn't have to put up with his grandfather's nagging at home. That was enough for him.

Although he had been constrained and restricted for many years, which was quite unpleasant, Xiao Cheng felt that it was enough after getting his face swollen.

But Wei Zhiren's question made Xiao Cheng a bit interested.

Little Black Monkey: What do you want to do?

Zhiren Zhiren: I don't want to do anything, I just want to make a serious attempt to poach my Cheng to my territory and avoid him being bullied by those fools outside. [Smile][Smile]

Seeing this message, Xiao Cheng's eyebrows twitched.

Then his lips uncontrollably curved upwards.

Looking at his phone screen, he replied after a while:

Little Black Monkey: Do you want to keep him?

Zhiren Zhiren: …?!

Zhiren Zhiren: You people! Please treat the relationship between fans and idols, bosses and employees with a sense of integrity, okay!?


Chapter 6:
Zi Zhenzhen: Think more beautiful thoughts in your mind! I never thought you would be such a monkey!

Zi Zhenzhen: [pointing.jpg]



As an actor famous for his aloof persona, Xiao Cheng shamelessly trampled his persona underfoot without a hint of hesitation.

Zi Zhenzhen: Monkey?

Little Black Monkey: Hmm?

Zi Zhenzhen: How about you help me gauge the situation a bit? [cute.jpg]

Xiao Cheng raised an eyebrow at Wei Zhenzhen's cute emoji.

Little Black Monkey: Sure.

Little Black Monkey: [cute.jpg]

Zi Zhenzhen: [hugging you tightly.jpg]

Zi Zhenzhen: Thank you! Mua!

Xiao Cheng wanted to reply with an Mua as well, but unfortunately, the props were ready, and the director was shouting to start the scene.

The actor遗憾ly put down his phone, hid his smile, adjusted his costume, and walked back in front of the camera.

Xiao Cheng had always known that Wei Zhenzhen, under the guise of Zi Zhenzhen, was his die-hard fan.

This was evident from Wei Zhenzhen's posts about her shopping sprees on Weibo and her multiple sponsorships of fan activities.

However, it was Wei Zhenzhen's mother who truly made him realize the depth of Wei Zhenzhen's love for him.

It was obvious that Xiao Cheng would not go out to dinner with every fan he met.

Moreover, the place where he encountered Wei Zhenzhen's mother was a rather private club. At the time, he was with his agent negotiating with the director of the current production. Towards the end of their discussion, the club owner personally knocked on the door to inform him that someone was looking for him.

Such situations were rare in such high-end clubs.

Xiao Cheng was initially displeased, but when he saw Wei Zhenzhen's mother—no, to be precise, the ring on her hand—his mood lifted slightly.

Xiao Cheng knew that Zi Zhenzhen was a boy.

He had the habit of peeking at screens and had seen the photo of the custom ring Wei Zhenzhen had posted. As a professional in the industry, he had a keen eye for such luxury items.

Before posting it on Weibo, Wei Zhenzhen had sent him numerous 360-degree photos of the ring along with another matching ring for a man, proudly showing it off.

He had boasted to Xiao Cheng that he was planning to give these as gifts to his parents.

Thus, Xiao Cheng immediately recognized the ring as the one Wei Zhenzhen had shown in the photo.

He also quickly guessed that the gentle-looking woman in front of him was the mother of his die-hard fan.

Out of respect for his long-time friend and consideration for his fan, Xiao Cheng did not refuse Wei Zhenzhen's mother's invitation to dinner.

Wei Zhenzhen's mother was in her fifties, but due to good care and a smooth life, she looked like she was in her thirties, radiating health and composure.

—She certainly did not exude the vulgar and materialistic vibe Wei Zhenzhen had described, believing that ”money could solve any problem in the world.“

Xiao Cheng was skilled at conversation, and with a few well-placed remarks, he learned quite a bit about Wei Zhenzhen.

For instance, Wei Zhenzhen's dark past, Wei Zhenzhen's dark past, and Wei Zhenzhen's dark past.

The reason Xiao Cheng realized Wei Zhenzhen was the person he had been looking for was also Wei Zhenzhen's mother.

This mother seemed unsatisfied with mere descriptions and pulled out her phone, sharing a collection of photos of Wei Zhenzhen with Xiao Cheng.

—Among them was a period of Wei Zhenzhen's high school days, a gloomy phase.

A loose-fitting sweater, basketball shorts, sneakers, holding a basketball, laughing so widely that only his white teeth were visible.

Oh.

Red scarf.

The red scarf was Wei Zhenzhen.

Wei Zhenzhen was Zi Zhenzhen.

These thoughts flashed through Xiao Cheng's mind, leaving him dumbfounded.

”Xiaozhen has liked you for quite some time now. Since high school, she said she had fallen for a celebrity, scaring me and her father.“

Wei Zhenzhen's mother said this with a beaming smile.

”Later, she even snuck into the film city… saying she was visiting the set. When her father found out, he gave her a beating.“

Indeed.

Xiao Cheng looked at the jovial-looking young man on the screen.

He had not only met Wei Zhenzhen that night but also during his time at the training camp.

Occasionally, he would go out to run errands or do bit parts to gain experience.

One time, while running a bit part in B City's film city, he saw the red scarf.

Xiao Cheng was dressed in his finest, wearing a military cap, a neat military uniform, and sturdy boots that clattered with every step, looking vibrant and entirely different from when he first met Wei Zhenzhen.

It was natural that Wei Zhenzhen did not recognize him.

However, seeing Xiao Cheng, Wei Zhenzhen's eyes lit up.

The young boy secretly pulled the crew member aside and asked who this was.

How did the crew member respond?

He said it was a rookie named Xiao Cheng.

Wei Zhenzhen wrote down the name seriously, and when he saw Xiao Cheng looking at him, he waved happily.

Then, as Xiao Cheng was about to approach, Wei Zhenzhen slipped away.

In the following weeks, whenever Xiao Cheng was in the film city, he could see Wei Zhenzhen nearby, watching him from a distance and running away as soon as he approached.

The blurry photos Xiao Cheng kept in his hand were of the distant, dark-skinned monkey Wei Zhenzhen.

Back then, the camera quality was poor, and the photos were already blurry. On modern devices, they were akin to having a Gaussian blur, making it impossible to see his face clearly, serving only as a nostalgic reminder.

What happened next?

Xiao Cheng recalled.

Wei Zhenzhen suddenly disappeared.

”Xiaozhen even insisted on spending money for you.“

Wei Zhenzhen's mother seemed to recall an amusing scene and could not help but laugh.

”Later, her brother came up with a solution. He told Xiaozhen that spending money was fine, but only if her grades improved. For every ten spots she moved up, he would record a ten-thousand-yuan investment. When you needed it, he would add the corresponding amount.“

Xiao Cheng: ”……“

”Back then, we thought Xiaozhen would give up. It was the summer before her senior year of high school, but after her first exam in senior year, she moved up by more than twenty spots.“

Wei Zhenzhen's mother's expression softened as she looked at Xiao Cheng.

”Xiaoming kept his word, recording two investments. By the end of her first semester in senior year, Xiaozhen was in the top ten of her class, with five investments recorded. Just when you officially launched, the money followed.“

Xiao Cheng was taken aback.

For him, being an actor was just a job. Even though he was aware of some fan behavior, such devotion was unprecedented.

Xiao Cheng's surprise pleased Wei Zhenzhen's mother, who continued, ”Xiaozhen wanted his brother to set up a company as an investment vehicle, called Weicheng. It has developed quite well now.“

Xiao Cheng was stunned: ”Weicheng? Isn't the owner of Weicheng Wei Zhenming?“

Wei Zhenzhen's mother was not surprised by Xiao Cheng's knowledge and simply replied, ”At first, it was. Later, it was Xiaozhen.“

Xiao Cheng could not say anything more.

In reality, as Xiao Cheng had risen to fame, what was intertwined with him was not


Chapter 7:
The agent approached anxiously, only to be turned away without even seeing Wei Ziming, dismissed with a smile by the CEO's assistant who said, ”Our boss merely appreciates Xiao Cheng.“

In the end, Xiao Cheng and the agent accepted this appreciation and, pulling on Wei Ziming's tiger skin, endured the initial most difficult period, even swelling the face of the CEO of Light and Shadow.

From his debut to now, the reason Xiao Cheng did not have much negative publicity was largely due to Weicheng continuously investing in him.

In the eyes of many people in the entertainment industry, Xiao Cheng was probably Wei Ziming's true love.

Who knew that the one secretly causing these troubles was Wei Zhen.

But thinking about it this way, the CEO of Light and Shadow, persistently trying to force him into submission, must have known that he actually had no connection with Wei Ziming.

After all, the circle of investors was rather small.

Xiao Cheng heard the sound of ”cut“ and looked up at the director with a frown, sighing and sincerely apologizing before bringing his scattered thoughts back and carefully completing the current shot.

The Emperor of the Silver Screen felt he owed a debt of gratitude.

Whether it was the kindness of a box of instant noodles a decade ago, or the support he had received over the past decade, he should repay it.

—After all, even his own family was unwilling to help after learning of his awkward predicament.

After the shooting, Xiao Cheng turned to find the director who looked like an old pro.

”Director Xu, I ask you, if you discover someone who has silently paid you for ten years without expecting anything in return, what would you do?“

The director had a sour expression: ”Where did you find such a foolish script?“

Xiao Cheng: ”…“

Director, speaking like that is likely to offend people.

The director stared at the screen in front of him, carefully reviewing the shot before raising his eyes to look at him.

”Following the typical plot, it would be offering oneself, or if it were a scoundrel, slapping two slaps and saying, ’Did I ask you for anything in return‘… roughly like that.“

Xiao Cheng nodded, quietly watching the screen in front of the director, propping his chin in his hand, lost in thought.

The author has something to say: Wei Zhen: ? I'm just a simple, shy, super adorable fan boy?

Xiao Cheng: Offering oneself… hmm… [Well-behaved.jpg]



Yes, he was.

At least on the surface.

After the director and the Emperor of the Silver Screen watched the shot together and confirmed no need for a re-take, he had a thoughtful look and walked to the side to ponder life.

Xiao Cheng's play was just beginning, with a heavy workload.

When the group scenes that did not require Xiao Cheng's participation were over, the production staff came to notify him to prepare for his scene, only to find the Emperor of the Silver Screen standing by the fan, wearing a large, dark blue robe with sleeves, his hands behind his back, the sleeves fluttering in the breeze, his fake hair dancing with the wind, his gaze distant, exuding an ethereal aura as if about to ascend to heaven.

The production staff stood there momentarily, then, when Xiao Cheng turned to look at him, came back to his senses, awkwardly looking at the Emperor of the Silver Screen and scratching his nose.

”Teacher Xiao, what are you doing here?“ the production staff asked.

Xiao Cheng looked at the production staff, pointing to the fan, his tone indifferent: ”Cooling off.“

The production staff looked up at the scorching sun above, ”Your scene is about to start.“

The Emperor of the Silver Screen responded, then, after the production staff left, gazed at the horizon for a while before finally taking his phone from his assistant.

He sent a message to his agent, Liu Xiaomai, with whom he had worked for over a decade, asking him to come to the set tonight.

Liu Xiaomai replied quickly, accepting the invitation from his old comrade.

The Emperor of the Silver Screen was unsure—Liu Xiaomai had dug him out of a construction site, and when Light and Shadow had been difficult, Liu Xiaomai, also employed by Light and Shadow Media, had gritted his teeth and fought with the higher-ups for him, resulting in the current Xiao Cheng.

The Emperor of the Silver Screen did not mind where he ended up, but Liu Xiaomai cared. They were like locusts on the same string, needing to move together.

The locust Emperor, upon receiving Liu Xiaomai's response, happily went to shoot his scene.

Liu Xiaomai put his phone down at the headquarters of Light and Shadow, straightened his clothes, took a deep breath, and entered the president's office.

By dinner time, the locust Emperor and Liu Xiaomai met. Liu Xiaomai's name sounded rustic and weak, but he was a tall, well-dressed elite.

He looked at Xiao Cheng who was removing his makeup, sitting down beside him.

”Cheng, what would you like to eat tonight?“ Liu Xiaomai asked.

Xiao Cheng glanced at him, ”Street-side spicy rice balls outside the film city.“

Liu Xiaomai: ”…Alright.“

The assistant helping with Xiao Cheng's makeup laughed, ”Brother Xiao, you've been staying up late and eating spicy rice balls recently, be careful of breakouts.“

Liu Xiaomai gave the assistant an appreciative look.

Xiao Cheng frowned, looked at the assistant, then at Liu Xiaomai.

The agent held up his hands, ”Alright, alright, spicy rice balls it is.“

Only then did Xiao Cheng look satisfied.

With Liu Xiaomai around, Xiao Cheng gave his assistant who had been following him today the day off, then bought two servings of spicy rice balls with Liu Xiaomai and returned to the hotel.

”What's the matter?“ Liu Xiaomai asked, blowing on the hot steam while eating a quail egg.

Xiao Cheng swallowed the lettuce in his mouth, put down his chopsticks, ”My contract is expiring.“

Liu Xiaomai paused, his casual expression changing, even sitting up a bit.

He asked, ”Do you have any ideas?“

Xiao Cheng nodded, ”I don't plan to stay at Light and Shadow.“

Liu Xiaomai was not surprised by Xiao Cheng's words, ”If you hadn't said it, I would have brought it up with you these past few days.“

Xiao Cheng ate a piece of fried tofu.

Liu Xiaomai sighed, ”I went to see Mr. Xu today to ask about your contract, but he didn't give any indication, looking quite against your leaving.“

”Mm.“ Xiao Cheng responded casually.

Of course, after enduring ten years of humiliation without being able to taste what he wanted, and even being publicly humiliated, Xu wouldn't have any objections.

”Mr. Xu is a bit mentally unstable, I think he'll cause trouble if you leave,“ Liu Xiaomai slurped on sweet potato starch, ”Are you already in contact with a new employer?“

Xiao Cheng did not answer, looking at Liu Xiaomai, slowly biting a piece of meat.

Then, slowly, he said, ”I found the person I was looking for.“

Liu Xiaomai was stunned, then after a long moment, reacted, sucking his teeth, ”Wow, that's really impressive.“

Xiao Cheng nodded in agreement, ”I told you about him.“

Liu Xiaomai rolled his eyes, ”I'm going deaf hearing about it.“

The Emperor of the Silver Screen smiled, his lips red from the spicy food, ”You have others working for you, what will you do if I leave?“

”I'm already prepared,“ Liu Xiaomai waved his hand, ”Did you find the red scarf who lured you to the construction site?“

”…“ Xiao Cheng found the description awkward but nodded, ”He is the new employer.“

Liu Xiaomai gasped, ”Could it be this coincidental?!“

”Even more coincidental,“ Xiao Cheng said casually, ”He is the owner of Weicheng.“

”Holy shit!?“ Liu Xiaomai nearly dropped his spicy rice balls, his voice rising, ”Wei Ziming!?“

Xiao Cheng shook his head, ”No, Wei Zhen.“

Liu Xiaomai thought for a moment, ”Never heard of him.“

Xiao Cheng slowly wiped his mouth, ”Zhen Zhen, the one who caused a big fuss the other day.“

Liu Xiaomai's face fell apart: ”…“

?

Hello?

Excuse me?

Liu Xiaomai felt Xiao Cheng was deceiving him.

He frowned, ”I'm not very educated, don't fool me.“

”The one I had dinner with is Wei Zhen's mother,“ Xiao Cheng simply opened his chat and handed it to Liu Xiaomai to read, ”The one who has been investing in me is not Wei Ziming, but Wei Zhen.“

The Emperor of the Silver Screen said, ”I feel I should repay my debt.“

Liu Xiaomai: ”…“

He could not refute it.


Chapter 8:
The agent finished reviewing the latest chat records and lit a cigarette, taking a deep drag.

Xiao Yindi glanced at him.

Liu Xiaomai casually handed the cigarette case to him.

Xiao Yindi, who would normally reach for a cigarette, firmly declined Liu Xiaomai today.

”Smoking is harmful to health,“ Xiao Cheng said, ”Smoking is the beginning of drug addiction.“

Liu Xiaomai felt that Xiao Cheng must be ill today.

”Are you really sick today, so happy to have found someone that you've gone mad?“

”No, it's just that I suddenly remembered that I said I wouldn't smoke when I first started my career,“ Xiao Cheng explained, determined to be a trustworthy good prince charming.

He pulled out a box of nicotine gum he had bought two days ago from his pocket, sniffing the cigarette smoke and then chewing two pieces of gum.

Liu Xiaomai was certain that Xiao Cheng was not acting normally today: ”Why do you suddenly remember this?“

”Because Wei Zhiren stopped smoking and even dislikes the smell of smoke because I said I don't smoke,“ Xiao Cheng spoke calmly, his tone slightly cold, but his eyes carried a hint of amusement.

This news naturally came from Wei Mu, who had no qualms about selling her son.

After all, everyone in the Wei family knew that Wei Zhiren had been a reckless troublemaker before meeting Xiao Cheng, but after encountering Xiao Cheng, he instantly transformed into a model citizen—helping old ladies cross the street while walking.

Wei Mu's meeting with Xiao Cheng was akin to wanting to reveal every detail about her son's underwear.

”I am planning to go to Weicheng, so I prepared to quit smoking in advance,“ Xiao Cheng said.

Liu Xiaomai pursed her lips and looked at the chat records on her phone, ”I think Wei Zhiren… Wei Sir, is quite… cute, he shouldn't be difficult with you just because you smoke?“

After all, the chat records had asked Xiao Cheng to view their relationship with an honest gaze, making it look pure and adorable.

”He definitely won't be difficult with me,“ Xiao Cheng said with great confidence, pausing briefly before speaking seriously, ”But I want to win him over.“

Liu Xiaomai: ”…“

No, man, you're getting into the act too quickly, I can't follow.

Liu Ma蚱 looked at Xiao Ma蚱, feeling that the rope holding their friendship was precarious.

…

Wei Zhiren was out with his friends again.

He blushed from drinking, holding a bottle of beer and tugging his childhood friend, shouting, ”Brother Dog! Listen to me! I've calculated with my fingers that Xiao Cheng is about to sign with me!“

His friend was dragged by him, the buttons of his shirt popping open.

He was trying to save his shirt while comforting his friend, ”Okay, okay, I know, I know. You're signing with him tomorrow, right? You're really great.“

Wei Zhiren became even happier, his sparkling eyes glistening under the light.

”Haha! So happy!“ He started dancing, then suddenly became quiet, sitting still on the sofa holding the bottle of beer.

The group of friends finally breathed a sigh of relief.

”Brother Dog, is Xiao Zhen drunk?“

Wei Zhiren's friend nodded, ”He's always like this when he's drunk, very quiet.“

The friends looked at the cute and adorable Wei Zhiren sitting quietly on the sofa, thinking of causing some trouble.

But before they could do anything, Wei Zhiren's phone rang with a new message notification.

They saw the quietly sitting Wei Zhiren, pretending to be a calm handsome man, turn to glance at the phone beside him, then suddenly let out a loud howl.

Everyone in the private room jumped in fright.

Wei Zhiren stuffed his phone into his pocket, stood up swiftly, and rushed out of the room with lightning speed.

As he left, he specially instructed, ”You don't need to follow me, I'm going downstairs to run ten laps!“

The friends left in the room looked at each other in bewilderment.

Wei Zhiren stood at the entrance of the club, the cool night breeze blowing away some of his intoxication.

He pulled out his phone and looked at the three messages, unable to help but chuckle foolishly.

Little Black Monkey: Asked.

Little Black Monkey: You can try to see him.

Little Black Monkey: Xiao Cheng has a very deep impression of you [smiling face].

The author has something to say:
Yindi: [cute.jpg]
Wei Zhiren: [crazy dance.gif]



If he could really predict that he would sign with Xiao Cheng tomorrow and actually sign, he wouldn't have to frequently seek his brother's favor for investments in Xiao Cheng's shows.

It was not easy to wield a small shovel to dig up Xiao Yindi.

In reality, Wei Zhiren's competitiveness was very low; he was not Wei Ziming, who held a group.

Because he was unwilling to compete with his brother, Wei Zhiren had rarely made formal appearances as Wei Ziming's younger brother over the years.

Otherwise, how would Xiao Cheng and Liu Xiaomai not know that Weicheng had long since changed its boss?

In fact, Wei Zhiren was very low-key, not fond of competing, and only enjoyed cultivating his own territory.

Weicheng was now his domain, which Wei Zhiren had carefully tended to for many years. He felt it was the right time to add something to this fertile land.

He wanted to plant a Xiao Cheng in this nursery of Weicheng.

He wanted Xiao Cheng to grow vigorously in this nursery, obtaining resources he had never had before, breaking free of constraints, and reaching a broader stage.

This was difficult, Wei Zhiren knew.

But he just hoped that Xiao Cheng would be better, even better.

To achieve such a goal, merely possessing the small Weicheng was impossible.

Wei Zhiren and Wei Ziming had long discussed the issue of company size. Wei Zhiren leveraged Wei Ziming's influence, constantly expanding various channels, and now the expansion was almost natural.

Weicheng was originally an investment company leaning towards the film and television industry, with most of its business focused on financial investment and also provided some investment advisory services.

The channels and relationships Wei Zhiren had developed over the years were mostly related to film and television.

Wei Zhiren boldly rented another floor of the office building in the city center and established a professional film department.

Years of operation and the benefits of having someone influential above made these advantages evident at this time.

The procedures and related documents for Weicheng's film department came one after another, with astonishing efficiency.

Throughout the years, the business partners Wei Zhiren had made in the film investment industry received messages one after another.

Those with sharper minds seized the opportunity, gaining benefits and then leaking many of the industry's unwritten rules and resources to Wei Zhiren.

The more straightforward ones directly shared suitable projects for large investments and mentioned many taboos.

Wei Zhiren smiled and accepted them all.

When he had digested and processed all these matters and leaned back exhaustedly on the soft sofa, it had already been more than two months since Little Black Monkey had replied to him.

Wei Zhiren was exhausted.

He had not gone home for a month, sleeping in the rest room next to the office every day, reading documents before bed and checking his phone for important unanswered calls first thing in the morning.

But despite the exhaustion, the harvest was significant.

On the floor above Weicheng's investment department, the film department had been renovated, with only the office supplies and personnel issues remaining.

This was something Wei Zhiren was not overly concerned about.

The film and television industry—more broadly, the entertainment industry—was never short of people or talent.

It was never short of young, energetic, and dream-filled individuals.

To establish oneself in this circle, one first needed to recruit a few veterans. Once they were lured in, the rest would follow like pulling a carrot with the mud attached.

At such times, the capabilities of the seasoned professionals in human resources were crucial.

Wei Zhiren lay on the sofa, staring at the ceiling like a floundering fish.

Suddenly finding himself free, his mind went blank.

When other thoughts gradually surfaced, Wei Zhiren sorrowfully realized they were all related to Xiao Cheng.

Wei Zhiren had immediately taken an interest in Xiao Cheng… his face.

Afterward, he often wandered around the film city, witnessing Xiao Cheng's hard work and humility, and began secretly investigating the person.

From when Xiao Cheng was a small nobody until he became a renowned actor praised by all, Wei Zhiren had always been watching him.

What investors could see was much more than ordinary fans.

He knew that Xiao Cheng had a good reputation among others.


Chapter 9:
He knew that Xiao Chengzhe had long been criticized for being supported by Wei Ziming.

He knew the injustice Xiao Chengzhe had endured.

He knew that when faced with injustice, Xiao Chengzhe neither lashed out in anger nor submitted; instead, he found a new path and overturned the injustice upon those who inflicted it.

He also knew that Xiao Chengzhe's acting skills were initially awkward, with even minor roles being cut down to just a few scenes.

He knew that Xiao Chengzhe worked extremely hard in the training camp, transforming himself in just two years.

He knew a great deal.

Wei Zhen thought to himself, pursing his lips, and vaguely felt that his infatuation might have gone too far.

Sigh.

Who would have thought he was Xiao Chengzhe's idol.

Wei Zhen thought, yawning, and finally opened the Weibo account he had put aside for a long time.

A new photo from Xiao Chengzhe's latest show had been posted.

He wore a square bun, a dark blue robe with wide sleeves, one hand holding a fan, the other behind his back, staring intently at the camera, lips slightly pursed, lips upturned, gaze distant and lingering.

A graceful gentleman, ethereal and almost otherworldly.

Oh my God.

Wei Zhen stretched out his legs, feeling that the boy was somewhat cold.

In the early morning, he felt a bit chilled.

Wei Zhen lay on the sofa, holding his phone, and calmed himself for twenty minutes. After saving the high-definition, uncensored photo, he gave it a thumbs up.

Maintaining his aloof demeanor... no, his aloof idol's style.

After giving a thumbs up, Wei Zhen felt it was a bit inappropriate—it seemed too cold.

So, he hit the share button.

The silent ”Forward Weibo“ four words made Wei Zhen feel even colder.

Wei Zhen pursed his lips, holding his phone, and flipped through QQ to harass his friends.

Zhenzhenzhen: QAQ Monkey, do you think I'm too aloof towards Xiao Chengzhe?

Zhenzhenzhen: Sigh.

After sending the message, Little Black Monkey did not respond to Wei Zhen because it was only six thirty in the morning.

The canteen in Weicheng started serving breakfast at seven o'clock.

Wei Zhen rubbed his stomach, got off the sofa, and decided to finish the last two documents.

This was the report his assistant had compiled the previous evening.

—Regarding the companies that had tried to poach Xiao Chengzhe recently.

…

The boss of Guangying was very persistent in his hatred towards Xiao Chengzhe—should we say, he was very persistent in his desire to sabotage Xiao Chengzhe.

Xiao Chengzhe's contract was indeed nearing its end, with only four months left.

Usually, at this time, either a renewal or finding a new company would occur, with everyone parting amicably.

And Xiao Chengzhe and Liu Xiaomai had clearly indicated their intention to find a new company.

However, General Manager Xu, who had gone to extreme lengths to sabotage Xiao Chengzhe, firmly rejected all inquiries from potential companies.

Holding the contract in his hand, he said he would not release Xiao Chengzhe if he did not want to.

And because Xiao Chengzhe had not publicly clashed with Guangying and his contract was about to expire, the companies did not take drastic measures to poach him by paying a breach of contract fee.

—In the end, it would expire anyway, so they could directly negotiate with Xiao Chengzhe.

The managers who had come back disappointed from Guangying thought little of Guangying's despicable tactics.

They simply stopped going to Guangying.

Instead, they directly contacted Xiao Chengzhe's agent, Liu Xiaomai.

Liu Xiaomai was as busy as a CEO, feeling the threat of baldness despite being only thirty-one or thirty-two years old.

Xiao Chengzhe had decided to go to Weicheng.

The boss of Weicheng also clearly expressed his intention to poach Xiao Chengzhe.

—Although both were speaking with veiled words, it did not seem to be an attempt to deceive.

Liu Xiaomai waited and waited, receiving one smiling, sincere manager after another, but never the representative from Weicheng.

He could not offend these seasoned veterans in the film industry, so he ultimately blamed General Manager Xu of Guangying, clearly stating that Xu would not release Xiao Chengzhe, and that talking to him was futile.

Liu Xiaomai had just finished lunch with a manager and ran to the Film City to find Xiao Chengzhe, who was sitting by a large fan cooling off.

Re Mantis asked the phone-playing Xiao Mantis, ”Why hasn't your red scarf arrived yet?“

Xiao Mantis looked at Wei Zhen's message on his phone, replied while chatting, and said casually, ”He might be shy.“

Liu Xiaomai: ”…“

I think you have a problem with your head.

Xiao Chengzhe ignored Liu Xiaomai's silence.

Little Black Monkey: ?

Zhenzhenzhen: Was my Weibo too aloof? [Dog Crying.jpg]

Little Black Monkey: It's fine.

Xiao Chengzhe thought for a moment and still glanced at Liu Xiaomai.

Liu Xiaomai looked at him莫名其妙.

Xiao Chengzhe decided to help his young, soon-to-be bald agent.

Little Black Monkey: Did you find Xiao Chengzhe?

Zhenzhenzhen: Not yet…

Zhenzhenzhen: I've been setting up a film department recently, just lacking manpower. Before talking to Xiao Chengzhe, I need to get the hardware in place, otherwise, it wouldn't be sincere.

Zhenzhenzhen: My idol is so good, I don't want to disappoint him [Shy Face.jpg]

Little Black Monkey: …

Xiao Chengzhe looked at Wei Zhen's message, pursing his lips.

The originally cold expression suddenly softened, a smile creeping onto his face.

Xiao Shadow King showed the message to Liu Xiaomai, earnestly saying, ”Look, Wei Zhen is so good, you need to endure a bit longer.“

Liu Xiaomai: ”…“

Just tell me, do you want to fight?

Zhenzhenzhen: Too busy, counting on my fingers, it's three days until my birthday, feeling like I won't have time again this year.

Zhenzhenzhen: [Headache.jpg]

Little Black Monkey: [Touching Head.jpg]

Re Mantis turned to look at Xiao Mantis, ”Do you usually chat with him like this?“

Xiao Mantis looked up, ”Yeah, what's wrong?“

Liu Xiaomai took out a cigarette, moved away from the fan, lit it, and then came back, squatting next to Xiao Chengzhe, glancing at the screen of Xiao Chengzhe's phone.

”This is your future boss.“

”Hmm.“ Xiao Chengzhe nodded, ”So?“

So why does it look like there's no boss-employee atmosphere between you two?

Brother, I'm really worried about your future.

Liu Xiaomai sighed deeply, ”Sigh, headache.“

Xiao Chengzhe: ”…“

You're crazy.

The author has something to say: Liu Xiaomai: I can't view your relationship with an honest perspective.

Wei Zhen: Vulgar! Low!

Xiao Chengzhe: Zhenzhen is right! [Crazy Call]



Xiao Chengzhe sat in the chair, resting his cheek on his hand, lightly tapping on his phone, writing a line, then deleting it one by one.

The time he had known Wei Zhen, under this disguise, had been more than six years.

Six years was enough for him to understand Wei Zhen's personality.

Xiao Chengzhe understood Wei Zhen.

For example, he knew that Wei Zhen particularly disliked grand celebrations for birthdays, festivals, and banquets.

The specific reason was supposedly due to a childhood trauma caused by his brother.

—After all, having a happy birthday party, only to have guests and elders praise Wei Ziming, was a heart-wrenching experience for young Wei Zhen.

So Wei Zhen began to refuse birthday banquets.

He preferred to stay at home playing games all day.

Later, as Wei Ziming became more and more outstanding, and surrounding people started flattery, Wei Zhen became even more averse to such gatherings.

He still chose to play games.

In the past, Wei Ziming felt guilty towards his younger brother and would come back to play games with Wei Zhen on his birthday.

Later, Wei Zhen found Wei Ziming's gaming skills too poor, so the birthday activity changed from playing games to fawning over his idol.

Wei Ziming no longer participated.

But this year, Wei Zhen could neither play games nor fawn over his idol.

He still had work to do.

A lot of work.

Xiao Chengzhe held his phone, inhaling the second-hand smoke from Liu Xiaomai, sighed, and popped two nicotine gum into his mouth.

Liu Xiaomai looked at him, ”What are you sighing about?“

Xiao Chengzhe pushed him, ”Don't smoke near me, it's tempting.“

Liu Xiaomai tsked, walked to the other side of Xiao Chengzhe, downwind, and continued smoking.


Chapter 10:
Xiao Cheng gazed at his phone for several more moments, thinking about how Wei Zhiren had been worn out by his affairs, and a tinge of sympathy stirred within him.

After all, Wei Zhiren had quietly done so much for him.

Xiao Cheng could not deny the affection he felt towards Wei Zhiren, whether it was the black monkey version from the past or the current fanboy version of the CEO, he rather liked both.

Little Black Monkey: You should rest.

Little Black Monkey: Aren't you the CEO? How can you handle everything personally?

Zhiren Zhiren: You are right.

Zhiren Zhiren: But this is Chengcheng's matter! It is not just any matter!

Zhiren Zhiren: Chengcheng's words are my direction! How can I entrust Chengcheng's matters to others!

Little Black Monkey: …

Zhiren Zhiren: Are you questioning my love for Chengcheng!?

Xiao Cheng: ”…“

No, he was not.

Xiao Cheng held his phone. Although this was the countless time he had seen Wei Zhiren's passionate declaration, after learning the true form of Wei Zhiren, Xiao Cheng suddenly felt a bit awkward.

After all, Wei Zhiren was supposed to be a high-and-cold, ascetic elite persona.

His attire was always impeccable, exuding a very serious demeanor.

Little Black Monkey: You have been busy for almost three months…

Zhiren Zhiren: My Chengcheng is still suffering in the Light and Shadow! How can I live in the sun alone!

Little Black Monkey: …

Little Black Monkey: [Your medicine.jpg]

Zhiren Zhiren: [The other party rejected your medicine and threw a dog at you.jpg]

Little Black Monkey: [The other party稳ly caught your dog.jpg]

Zhiren Zhiren: I am finishing up here, I will contact Chengcheng's agent in a few days!

Zhiren Zhiren: I must rescue the incomparably handsome and adorably cute Chengcheng from the evil Light and Shadow Great Demon!

Incomparably Handsome and Adorably Cute Chengcheng: ”…“

Oh.

You are happy.

Sigh.

Headache.

Xiao Cheng put away his phone and turned to look at Liu Xiaomai, who had finished smoking a whole cigarette.

”My red scarf is coming to find you.“

”What?“ Liu Xiaomai was momentarily bewildered, then quickly recovered, ”Oh, you mean your White Moonlight.“

Xiao Cheng was also bewildered, completely unaware of how Wei Zhiren had upgraded to White Moonlight.

—Clearly it was soy sauce fried rice.

But for some reason, Xiao Cheng did not refute Liu Xiaomai's words.

He merely nodded, ”I said I would come in a few days.“

Liu Xiaomai was overjoyed. He could finally get rid of those clingy producers and clearly tell them that Xiao Cheng had found someone else.

Ah, happiness!

”If he comes to you, remember to notify me,“ Director Xiao reminded his agent, ”Absolutely notify me.“

Liu Xiaomai extinguished his cigarette, ”Alright, alright, whatever you say, just get me out of this sea of social engagements.“

Liu Xiaomai, elated with the good news, left the film city happily.

He even had a good mood and ate a bowl of spicy rice noodles outside the film city.

He shamelessly took a photo and sent it to Xiao Cheng, who could only have lunch and dinner with the production crew and had to shoot scenes immediately after eating.

Director Xiao: ”…“

…

Wei Zhiren said he would contact Liu Xiaomai in a few days, and indeed, he did contact Liu Xiaomai after two days.

—Of course, it was not Wei Zhiren himself, but his assistant.

Liu Xiaomai agreed on the time and place of the meeting with the assistant and was delighted when he learned that Wei Zhiren would be there in person.

Finally coming, no more headaches with those producers who loved to build connections like they were playing Tai Chi!

Liu Xiaomai was moved to tears.

He had been out socializing and drinking almost every day these months, now seeing alcohol made his head hurt and the smell of it made him want to vomit.

The people from Weicheng finally came to meet him!

When Liu Xiaomai told Xiao Cheng about this, he felt light-headed, his body floating as if weightless.

He was clearly in high spirits, even bringing spicy rice noodles to Xiao Cheng at dinnertime this time.

Xiao Cheng took the spicy rice noodles and looked at him, ”When is the meeting?“

Liu Xiaomai eagerly lifted the lid of the takeout box for Xiao Cheng and handed him the chopsticks, ”Six PM tomorrow, C Club, eat, drink, and chat.“

Xiao Cheng paused as he took the chopsticks.

”Tomorrow?“

Liu Xiaomai nodded.

Xiao Cheng slowly picked up a piece of fried tofu, ”I will go too.“

”Huh?“

Liu Xiaomai was stunned, remembering Xiao Cheng's obsession with Wei Zhiren, he couldn't help but worry that Xiao Cheng might end up selling himself.

The agent thought for a moment and tactfully reminded Director Xiao, ”I remember you've been quite busy with your shows recently.“

”I will take a day off,“ Xiao Cheng blew on the steaming food.

Liu Xiaomai looked at Xiao Cheng in shock, ”You are actually taking a day off?“

Xiao Cheng raised an eyebrow, ”Why can't I?“

”It's just… you have rarely taken days off after so many years of shooting, I am quite surprised.“

It was thanks to his dedication that Xiao Cheng had such a good reputation and popularity in the film industry, often acting with injuries or illnesses, and never complaining even after days of sleepless work.

Xiao Cheng's last time taking a day off was when a family member passed away.

The director looked at Xiao Cheng, concerned, ”Is… something wrong at home?“

Xiao Cheng held the spicy rice noodles and ate the fish balls, looking at the worried director, he shook his head calmly, ”No, just some personal matters to handle.“

The director was still worried, but since Xiao Cheng did not elaborate, he did not press, only patting Xiao Cheng's shoulder, ”Go, how long?“

”Just one day, I will be back the day after tomorrow.“

Little Black Monkey: Really, I will send you a birthday gift [smile]



Wei Zhiren was very happy.

Without hesitation, he threw out the address of his residential district.

Zhiren Zhiren: Sure >▽< I will give you my address!

Zhiren Zhiren: Such a good umbilical cord! [crazy dance.gif]

Xiao Cheng looked at the address for a while, then threw the finished spicy rice noodles into the trash.

How should he explain that he was not sending something there, but going there himself as Xiao Cheng?

Director Xiao fell into deep thought.

He could not possibly tell Wei Zhiren, ”I am sending Xiao Cheng to you.“

Such words coming from his mouth would be too humiliating.

Xiao Cheng thought for a long time before replying with one word.

Little Black Monkey: Sure.

He decided to pick a gift and send it to Wei Zhiren under Little Black Monkey's name.

Since he had a whole day off tomorrow, he could look for something suitable to give Wei Zhiren.

Director Xiao felt he was incredibly smart.

”Xiaomai, what gift should I send Wei Zhiren?“ Xiao Cheng humbly sought advice from Liu Xiaomai.

Liu Xiaomai replied without hesitation, ”Send yourself!“

Xiao Cheng nodded first, then shook his head, ”It's not enough.“

Liu Xiaomai choked, looking at Director Xiao, ”I think with Weicheng's wealth and capabilities, he should have everything that money can buy.“

Xiao Cheng thought about it too.

He supported his chin in thought, unable to think of what would be a good gift.

Liu Xiaomai asked, ”What does Mr. Wei like?“

Xiao Cheng answered without thinking, ”Me.“

Liu Xiaomai: ”…“

The agent thought Director Xiao was extremely confident.

Liu Xiaomai asked again, ”Besides you?“

”…“ Xiao Cheng carefully recalled his interactions with Wei Zhiren over the years, ”Sweets.“

Liu Xiaomai: ”…“

Oh!

Truly a hobby filled with girlish charm.


Chapter 11:
”I cannot send sweets,“ Xiao Cheng felt that this idea was fraught with problems. ”In terms of sentiment, I wouldn't even know how to make desserts myself.“

Liu Xiaomai made a sound of frustration, feeling at a loss: ”I can't think of anything.“

Xiao Yingdi looked at his agent with derision: ”No wonder you haven't been able to catch up with Qingjie for all these years.“

The agent stamped his foot: ”What does sending a gift have to do with it! You don't even know what to send!“

”No, I know now.“ Xiao Yingdi shook his head lightly and said, ”Wei Zhiren likes me more than he likes sweets.“

The agent raised his eyebrows in exasperation: ”So?“

”So…“ Xiao Cheng looked at Liu Xiaomai, paused, and then curled his lip, ”I won't tell you.“

Liu Xiaomai: ”…“

The agent really wanted to beat Xiao Yingdi up, but that would be a crime.

In the end, he left the set in a rage, eating two large bowls of spicy hot pot outside the film city, seething with anger, and took a bunch of photos to send to Xiao Cheng.

However, Xiao Cheng was full and busy filming and did not pay him any heed.

…

It happened to be the weekend.

Wei Zhiren was very eager for his friend to give him a gift.

President Wei Zhiren, filled with anticipation, slept until midday.

He was a bit nervous about meeting Xiao Cheng's agent in the afternoon.

Wei Mu called him down to have lunch.

Wei Zhiren responded and got up from the soft bed, rubbed his tousled hair, and slapped on his slippers, clomping into the bathroom.

He wondered what the monkey would give him as a gift.

As he brushed his teeth, he hoped it wouldn't be some sophisticated thing like flowers, tea, or plants.

He knew that such things would end up with his brother and father, as he wouldn't even know how to appreciate or take care of them.

Wei Zhiren admitted that he was a very vulgar person. He would rather the other person give him jade or precious stones directly, equivalent in value.

Or even just a big red envelope.

Wei Mu was sitting by the dining table.

Since Wei Zhiren was born, Wei Mu gradually put aside her career to focus on taking care of her family.

The family relations and atmosphere in the Wei household were very harmonious. There had never been any disputes over inheritance or infidelity.

When Wei Mu decided to quit her career, Wei Fu even tried to stop her.

But Wei Mu was resolute, and after much persuasion, Wei Fu had no choice but to accept it—then he even split his salary card and shares in the group equally with Wei Mu, fully demonstrating his love and loyalty to his wife.

Today was Wei Zhiren's birthday. According to tradition, family members would return home to gather on the day of someone's birthday, no matter how busy they were.

Wei Zhiren did not like throwing parties or inviting a large group of people to celebrate his birthday. So, every time Wei Zhiren had a birthday, he would have dinner and chat with his family to strengthen their bond.

But today, neither Wei Fu nor Wei Ziming returned.

Because Wei Zhiren had notified them a few days in advance that he had something to do today and asked them not to make time to return.

Wei Mu was a bit unhappy about this, but she didn't say anything more.

Usually, there was a housekeeper to cook meals at home. Today was Wei Zhiren's birthday, so Wei Mu decided to cook a big meal for him herself.

Wei Mu's cooking skills were actually quite average and not as good as the housekeeper's.

But Wei Zhiren praised her with every bite, looking content and surprised, extolling her dishes to the skies, making his mother glow with happiness, her smile uncontrollable.

Halfway through the meal, the doorbell rang suddenly.

Wei Zhiren peered through the peephole and saw the security guard from the neighborhood.

He opened the door, and the guard handed him a package.

The recipient was written as Zhiren Zhiren.

The security measures for deliveries in Wei Zhiren's neighborhood were quite strict because the residents were all wealthy people from B City.

Deliveries were usually left at the door of the neighborhood, then the security guards would deliver them to the respective owners.

Wei Zhiren received a lot of deliveries.

When he bought things like Xiao Cheng's merchandise, he would bring whole boxes into the house.

The recipient was usually written as Zhiren Zhiren.

The guard was used to this and, after confirming there was nothing wrong, delivered it directly.

Seeing Wei Zhiren bring a package back, Wei Mu casually asked, ”What did you buy this time? It's such a small package.“

Wei Zhiren smiled, looking at the little black monkey written on the sender's name, feeling quite good: ”A friend said they would send me a birthday gift.“

Wei Zhiren set the flat rectangular package aside, finished his meal with his mother, and then got a box cutter to open the package.

”Guess what it is?“ Wei Zhiren sat on the sofa, holding the package and murmuring.

Wei Mu also sat down, watching him open it: ”From the shape, it might be a drawing or something? Or a book?“

Wei Zhiren shrugged, ”Unlikely, the monkey knows me well.“

He knew very well that Wei Zhiren didn't like to read or study.

If it weren't for Xiao Cheng, Wei Zhiren wouldn't have studied properly.

The package was opened, and inside were several layers of foam paper carefully wrapping the actual gift.

Wei Zhiren weighed it, looking incredulous: ”It really is a book?“

Wei Zhiren didn't believe it and quickly removed the foam paper.

—Then another box appeared.

Wei Zhiren: ”…“

He suspected the monkey was up to something.

While pondering whether his friend was teasing him, Wei Zhiren turned the box over and saw a smiling face drawn on it.

It seemed to be mocking him.

Wei Mu laughed.

Wei Zhiren looked at his mother with a pout, angrily opening the box and taking out the contents.

It was a very beautifully bound and elegant album, with a cover larger than the inner pages for protection. The color was dark blue, with a good texture, the album not thin and quite heavy in his hand.

Along with the album, a greeting card that had been covering the cover was also taken out.

”Really a book,“ Wei Zhiren complained as he opened the card.

The writing on the card was very beautiful, with sharp, powerful strokes, the characters neat and clearly indicating that the person had practiced well.

I'm sending you Xiao Cheng's past.
Stay calm, okay?:)

By the little black monkey

Wei Zhiren was stunned, flipping the card over and over.

”Send me Xiao Cheng's past?“ Wei Zhiren put down the card, looking confused at the thick album, suddenly feeling a pang in his heart.

The card had hidden the cover, which had the words ”album“ in golden letters.

Wei Zhiren: ”…“

I, I'll be damned.

It couldn't be…

Wei Zhiren looked up at Wei Mu.

Wei Mu was stunned: ”What's wrong?“

”I'm going back to my room,“ Wei Zhiren calmly returned to his room with the album and card.

He was afraid he would scare his mother.

Wei Zhiren returned to his room, took a deep breath, and then nervously opened the album.

The first page showed a couple holding an infant looking at the camera, the tone soft and warm, almost tangible happiness almost reaching out from the photo.

The second page showed the baby in a crib, reaching for a rattle nearby.

The third page showed the baby smiling at the camera, showing tiny milk teeth.

The fourth page showed the baby learning to walk in a walker.

The fifth page…

When Wei Zhiren flipped to the fifth page, he saw the word ”three“ written on it.

He quickly flipped through the album.

The main subject of the album changed from an infant to a child, from a child to a teenager, from a teenager to a young man, and finally grew into an outstanding adult.

—an adult who Wei Zhiren was very familiar with and loved by many.

He was handsome, dashing, with a cold expression, sitting on the bed reading a book, exuding a refined and proud aura.

It was Xiao Cheng.

The birthday gift Wei Zhiren received was an album recording Xiao Cheng's life journey up until now.

Twenty years of joys and sorrows, twenty years of growth and hard work.

It recorded every step Xiao Cheng had taken from childhood to adulthood, every precious moment.

This gift was an unparalleled treasure to Wei Zhiren.

Wei Zhiren's mind was blank, almost forgetting how to breathe.

Little black monkey: Did you receive the gift?

Zhiren Zhiren: Ahahahahahahaha monkey dad!


Chapter 12:
Zi Zhenzhen: You are truly my angel, ahahahahahahahaha!

Zi Zhenzhen: [First explode in respect.jpg]



After finishing his performance yesterday, he rushed home and rummaged through his drawers to find all his photo albums from childhood to present, adding several recent ones as well.

Originally, the albums were blank from the time Xiao Cheng turned eighteen—because after he ran away from home, Liu Xiaomai dug him out of the construction site and brought him into the entertainment industry.

His family had always opposed his chosen career path, and he was sulking and refused to contact them.

It wasn't until he gained a foothold in this circle and was assigned to star in a major film about the founding of the nation that his family reluctantly accepted him.

Therefore, the albums were empty from the time Xiao Cheng turned eighteen to the present.

Xiao Cheng had to gather photos from his college classmates and Liu Xiaomai, among other acquaintances, carefully selecting them and having them printed out that very night, then laminating them into an album.

After a busy evening, he finally finished just in time for ten in the morning.

Glancing at the time, Xiao Cheng quickly ate something to satisfy his hunger, wrote a greeting card, wrapped the album, and handed the package to his assistant, instructing him to deliver it personally to the neighborhood.

—Courier services were unreliable, and since both Xiao Cheng and Wei Zhenzhen lived in B City, it was best to entrust the task to someone he trusted.

Xiao Cheng's assistants were quite perceptive and did not ask any questions. After receiving the package and instructions, they left without delay.

Next, Xiao Cheng went straight to his stylist and asked for their help.

Xiao Cheng was preparing to create a flawless, idealized image of a handsome man.

Yes, because he was going to have a formal meeting with Wei Zhenzhen in the afternoon, even the Emperor of Acting had to get his appearance done.

Xiao Cheng's stylist was quite surprised.

Looking at Xiao Cheng, the assistant brought them both a glass of water.

The stylist, full of curiosity, asked, ”I haven't received any notice about any shows you're scheduled for, why are you suddenly getting a makeover?“

Xiao Cheng sat in his chair, glanced at the time on his watch, and pursed his lips, ”It's a private matter.“

”A private matter that requires a makeover?“ The stylist was even more surprised, completely unaffected by Xiao Cheng's cold face, ”In my lifetime, I could never have imagined you using public resources for personal gain.“

The Emperor of Acting took a deep breath, too lazy to explain further, and pulled out his phone to contact Liu Xiaomai to arrange for another styling team.

The stylist raised his hands, ”Alright, alright, I won't ask. Do it, do it, do it.“

If Liu Xiaomai found out that Xiao Cheng had his own stylist but was still hiring others, his performance bonus for the month would surely go down the drain.

”Let's eat first, it's lunchtime,“ the stylist pointed to the clock on the wall.

One o'clock in the afternoon.

Xiao Cheng calculated the time and nodded.

When Xiao Cheng received Wei Zhenzhen's message, he and his stylist had just finished lunch.

The Emperor of Acting looked at his phone, his lips curling slightly.

Little Black Monkey: I like it.

Zi Zhenzhen: [Crazy Dance of Joy.gif]

Zi Zhenzhen: My little monkey!

Little Black Monkey: Talk.

Zi Zhenzhen: What exactly is your relationship with Cheng Cheng!

Zi Zhenzhen: [Rabbit Lady's eyes suddenly sharpened.jpg]

Xiao Cheng sat in front of the makeup table, his eyes lowered as he looked at his phone screen, tapping his fingers several times, ultimately deleting the answer ”I am Xiao Cheng“ word by word.

He knew Wei Zhenzhen did not want too many people to know about his real personality.

Even as Xiao Cheng's fanboy, the persona ”Zi Zhenzhen,“ maintained a cool demeanor most of the time.

Xiao Cheng was well aware of this because Wei Zhenzhen had explicitly told him about it.

Wei Zhenzhen wanted to present to Xiao Cheng an image of intelligence, composure, and a wealthy, reliable figure—although he often cried to Little Black Monkey, feeling too cold.

…In fact, this image of reliability and grandeur had long since crumbled in Xiao Cheng's heart.

But Wei Zhenzhen did not know this!

Xiao Cheng looked at his phone screen, feeling a bit conflicted.

What if he told Wei Zhenzhen he was Xiao Cheng, and Wei Zhenzhen suddenly exploded and refused to see him?

The Emperor of Acting thought for a while, and considering Wei Zhenzhen's personality, it was quite possible.

After all, negotiating such matters with Liu Xiaomai could have been easily entrusted to his assistant.

Wei Zhenzhen personally arranged to meet Liu Xiaomai solely out of his love for Xiao Cheng.

The Emperor of Acting thought long and hard, but even when the stylist had prepared all the styling tools, he could not come up with a solution.

Finally, he typed two words.

Little Black Monkey: Guess?

Zi Zhenzhen: Guess I guess not? [Well-behaved.jpg]

Little Black Monkey: Guess I guess you guess not? [Cute.jpg]

Zi Zhenzhen: …

Zi Zhenzhen: Forget it, I'll ask Cheng myself later!

Zi Zhenzhen: [Blah blah blah.jpg]

Xiao Cheng raised his eyebrows, exhaled lightly, and put his phone aside.

In short, he had managed to deceive him.

Xiao Cheng looked at his reflection in the makeup table mirror and felt a headache coming on.

He did not mind if Little Black Monkey's persona was exposed; what he cared about was whether Wei Zhenzhen would still be as free and unrestrained with him after knowing he was Little Black Monkey.

…The answer was clearly no.

If Wei Zhenzhen could act so freely facing Xiao Cheng's identity, he would not have received only a [doge] reply when Xiao Cheng used his real name to reply to his Weibo.

Little Black Monkey had seen Wei Zhenzhen's various ways of declaring his love for Xiao Cheng in three hundred sixty degrees throughout the years.

It was like changing styles every day, never repeating.

But all these elaborate declarations in private resulted in only one [doge] reply to Xiao Cheng's real name.

[doge] what [doge].

Better to keep the Little Black Monkey persona for now.

The Emperor of Acting sighed.

Ah, headache.

…

Wei Zhenzhen was rolling on the bed.

Looking at the photo album on the nightstand, he felt his soul elevated!

Xiao Cheng's!

Photo album!

From infancy!

To adulthood!

Photo album!

Wei Zhenzhen's rolling abruptly stopped as his gaze turned to the nightstand, and he let out another wail.

So happy, so happy, so happy!

Wei Zhenzhen rolled excitedly, hugging the thin air conditioner blanket, wrapping himself like a crepe pancake.

Then he squirmed like a caterpillar on the bed.

Mr. Wei, the Sloth President, indulged in his madness in a room unseen by anyone.

Until his assistant, Little Wang, called to remind him that it was time to meet Liu Xiaomai as scheduled.

Pancake Wei stretched out his hand to grab the phone and asked foolishly, who Liu Xiaomai was.

”…“ Assistant Wang was speechless for a moment, his tone filled with helplessness, ”He is Xiao Cheng's agent, Mr. Wei.“

Wei Zhenzhen: ”…“

Oh!

Wei Zhenzhen slapped his head and sat up, ”Alright, I'll be right there.“

Assistant Wang, satisfied with the response, hung up and contacted the driver to pick him up.

Wei Zhenzhen glanced at the time, four o'clock.

Their meeting was scheduled for six.

It only took half an hour from home to C Club.

Wei Zhenzhen was very serious about prying into Jiang Guang's secrets, and the expansion of the new department in Weicheng had been quite a stir.

Although Weicheng's employees were unaware that Wei Zhenzhen was Xiao Cheng's fanboy, they all knew that Wei Zhenzhen had placed Weicheng Film Department's first battle on Xiao Cheng.

The entire Weicheng was highly concerned and valued this matter.

Therefore, to show his sincerity, Wei Zhenzhen arrived at the club an hour early with his assistant.

He had expected to wait for at least half an hour, but as soon as they entered, the club's staff greeted them, saying that the guest had already arrived in the suite and had been waiting for ten minutes.

Wei Zhenzhen was quite surprised—he never imagined that Liu Xiaomai would be more proactive than him.

Why?

Wei Zhenzhen entered the suite with doubts, but stopped in his tracks the moment he stepped in.

There was more than one person in the suite.


Chapter 13:
Aside from the person named Liu Xiaomai, whom Wei Zhiren had only seen in photographs, there was another individual.

This was someone whom Wei Zhirne knew incredibly well, someone he gazed at from different angles countless times every day.

—Xiao Cheng.

Xiao Cheng, who was sitting directly opposite the room's door, raised his head to look at Wei Zhiren.

The man standing at the door was dressed in a perfectly tailored suit, his short, tousled hair neatly combed. Perched on his straight nose were a pair of gold-rimmed glasses that obscured the softness of his peach blossom eyes.

He was dressed entirely like a successful businessman.

This was in stark contrast to the memory of the dusky youth who had once been known for his toothy grin, barely visible eyebrows, and sickly yellow complexion.

He had become… extraordinarily handsome and radiant.

Xiao Cheng stood up, his gaze fixed on Wei Zhiren, a faint smile playing on his lips.

The aura around him seemed softened by the warm tones of the room's lighting, even his slightly sharp eyes reflecting a gentle orange hue.

Seeing that Wei Zhiren had not reacted for quite some time, Xiao Cheng couldn't help but clear his throat.

”Long have I heard of your great reputation; it is a pleasure to finally meet you, Mr. Wei.“

Xiao Yingdi's voice carried a touch of warmth, though his expression remained stern, as if he were merely making a polite introduction: ”I am Xiao Cheng.“

Of course, I know you are Xiao Cheng.

Wei Zhiren stood rooted to the spot at the room's entrance.

The din of the surroundings seemed to fade away in that instant, leaving only the thunderous sound of his heartbeat, pounding against his eardrums.

Wei Zhiren felt as though he had not woken up properly.

Otherwise, how could he have opened the door and seen his idol right away?

He stared blankly at Xiao Cheng for a while, then raised his hand to push up the plain glasses on his nose.

”Long admired, Mr. Xiao Yingdi.“

Wei Zhiren maintained a cold expression, holding himself like a seasoned corporate president, suppressing the urge to turn and run screaming. He walked to the sofa opposite Xiao Cheng, locking eyes with him and speaking in a cold, unfriendly tone.

”I am Wei Zhiren.“

After finishing, Wei Zhiren sat down, looking at the seated Xiao Cheng across from him, feeling as though he had lost his senses.

My… idol is only a meter away!

Realizing this, Wei Zhiren's face remained cold, and his hands, resting on his legs, clenched into fists.

I… really want to throw myself at him, QAQ

Wei Zhiren had something to say to the author: Wei Zhiren: I can't control my urges!

Xiao Cheng: Don't control them, just have fun; I'll take over after you:)



He was very clear that his current intelligence was not functioning properly, and it would be best not to engage in any important matters.

After shifting the blame, Wei Zhiren sat there like a statue, not daring to move, afraid that any wrong posture or angle would give Xiao Cheng a bad impression.

Wei Zhiren really wanted to get up and leave.

—When facing Xiao Cheng, Wei Zhiren was always very… shy.

Yes, shy.

This was evident from when Wei Zhiren had quietly gone to the film city, found Xiao Cheng, yet still only dared to squat far away, secretly watching.

If he weren't shy, he would have rushed straight to Xiao Cheng long ago, rather than watching from afar and running away the moment he was discovered.

Wei Zhiren was extremely nervous.

He sat there, on what should have been a soft sofa, feeling as though he were sitting on pins and needles.

—Xiao Cheng was watching him.

Wei Zhiren clearly felt the gaze of the person opposite him.

He lowered his eyes to the water glass in front of him, feeling as though his scalp would explode.

Who am I? Where am I?

Where did I come from? Where am I going?

Why am I here? What should I do?

Wei Zhiren stared at the glass, at the various reflections of Xiao Cheng on its uneven surface, unable to pull his scattered thoughts back together.

Ah, my Cheng is staring at me; I might die.

Wei Zhiren muddled through his thoughts, feeling as though his soul was about to escape his body.

Xiao Cheng looked at Wei Zhiren, who was staring down at the glass as though seriously studying the intricate design, gazing openly at him.

In reality, Wei Zhiren's former appearance was already blurry in Xiao Cheng's memory.

Apart from the deep impression of the things Wei Zhiren had done, Xiao Cheng's memory of the former Wei Zhiren was limited to his façade.

Little Black Monkey.

His skin tanned by the sun, his personality outgoing, his smile unreserved, revealing a beautiful set of white teeth.

—In Xiao Cheng's memory, Wei Zhiren was someone who would make one genuinely happy after meeting and interacting with him.

Indeed, he was entirely different from the handsome, fair-skinned, and meticulously dressed social elite he was now.

However, considering what Wei Mu had said, Wei Zhiren's transformation from the boisterous teenager with a basketball to his current appearance was largely due to him.

Thinking of this, Xiao Cheng felt a wave of warmth.

In life, how many people would wholeheartedly dedicate themselves to you?

Xiao Cheng stared at Wei Zhiren, trying to etch his image firmly in his mind—no longer could he forget that shadow.

He had to remember well.

With this thought, Xiao Yingdi kept his gaze on Wei Zhiren from the moment he sat down.

Both Wang Tezhu, Wei Zhiren's assistant, and Liu Xiaomai, Xiao Cheng's assistant, noticed this.

The two who had been blamed looked at each other for a moment, then simply ignored the strange atmosphere between the other two, focusing on discussing Xiao Cheng's job change.

Wei Zhiren had done extensive research before meeting Liu Xiaomai and was very familiar with the projects in the film department, which Wang Tezhu had worked on throughout. Additionally, Liu Xiaomai had been eagerly awaiting negotiations from the Weicheng side, and both parties had made conscious concessions on many clauses.

They clicked instantly, enjoying a pleasant conversation.

Their exchange was smooth, and progress was excellent.

As they talked happily, they both looked at Xiao Cheng and Wei Zhiren.

However, those two did not notice their movements.

One had eyes only for the president, staring intently.

The other had eyes only for the cup, lost in thought.

Liu Xiaomai and Wang Tezhu felt they were both very embarrassing.

The agent cleared his throat and refocused on the documents in his hand.

Wang Tezhu pretended not to have noticed and also looked away.

”The fourth document details what we can do after Xiao Cheng joins Weicheng, including the well-established packaging team we are now negotiating with. All these resources can be attributed to Xiao Cheng.“

Wang Tezhu spoke with a steady tone.

”Weicheng has Blue Star Group as its backing, with ample funds and a promising future. We promise to allocate the maximum resources to Xiao Cheng, showing our sincerity.“

Hearing this, Liu Xiaomai took out the fourth document and flipped through it.

This made him jump.

There was nothing else; if Weicheng could actually deliver on what this document promised, it would be a huge leap forward for Xiao Cheng's career.

Liu Xiaomai was very tempted—according to this document, almost all the resources in Weicheng's film department now belonged to Xiao Cheng. Even if they signed with others in the future, those individuals would not receive more resources than Xiao Cheng.

It was almost like…

Liu Xiaomai thought for a moment—it was like a studio specifically tailored for Xiao Cheng.

The agent felt something was amiss, but seeing Wang Tezhu's expression, he didn't think there was anything wrong.

Liu Xiaomai carefully read the document again, taking a deep breath.

It was truly tempting, making his heart race.

”This is better than the benefits offered by most domestic companies,“ said Liu Xiaomai.

”This is, of course,“ Wang Tezhu nodded.

Liu Xiaomai was silent for a moment, then turned to Wei Zhiren, who was staring blankly at the cup.

He raised his voice: ”Mr. Wei.“

Wei Zhiren stirred slightly, looking up at him.

”I'll be blunt, Mr. Wei,“ said Liu Xiaomai, patting his pocket and finding no cigarettes. ”In fact, Xiao Cheng has been waiting for you.“

What does this mean?

Wei Zhiren and Wang Tezhu were taken aback.

Does this mean they are deciding to sign?

Before Liu Xiaomai could finish, ”To be precise, he has been waiting for the boss of Weicheng, Mr. Wei. You have invested in Xiao Cheng for so many years; could you explain why?“

”Why?“ Wei Zhiren repeated.


Chapter 14:
He stared at Liu Xiaomai for quite some time, then glanced at Xiao Cheng, his gaze meeting Xiao Cheng's, his mind still a jumbled mess.

Then he answered the question: ”Because I like him.“

Wang Tezhu: ”……“

Liu Xiaomai: ”……“

This direct shot came as a complete surprise!

Xiao Cheng was also shocked by this unadorned confession.

The compartment fell into an eerie silence.

Wei Zhiren was momentarily stunned, and his jumbled mind gradually realized what he had just said, instantly wishing he could have beaten himself up for it.

What if his character was ruined?

Wei Zhiren's heart collapsed.

He forced a cold, aloof corporate president's face, feeling as though his entire being had been drained, his mind turning into a void.

Xiao Cheng remained stunned for a long time before coming to his senses, raising his hand to cover his mouth with a fist, letting out a light cough.

The remaining three people in the compartment all fixed their gaze on him.

Liu Xiaomai and Wang Tezhu's eyes sparkled as they looked at Xiao Cheng as if he were a god, hoping he could salvage this awkward atmosphere.

Wei Zhiren sat upright, exuding an air of aloofness and superiority, as if he did not feel he had said anything wrong, though his heart was dark and desolate.

…Pill.

Xiao Cheng definitely could not take it anymore.

Wei Zhiren looked at Xiao Cheng with a calm and indifferent expression, tears welling up in his heart.

Faced with Wei Zhiren's coldness, Xiao Yinying did not care.

He put down his hand, fingers lightly tapping the table, but the words that came out were completely unrelated, ”May I have the honor of having dinner with Mr. Wei?“

The three people in the compartment were stunned.

Xiao Cheng tapped the table again, adding, ”Just the two of us.“

Wei Zhiren and his assistant looked blank.

Liu Xiaomai frantically signaled to Xiao Cheng.

Be a little more restrained, Mr. Yinying!

The agent's heart was in turmoil.

Wei Zhiren was gently nudged by his assistant, who seemed to be reminding him to pay attention.

Cold corporate president Wei Zhiren raised his hand to push up his glasses.

He asked, ”Why?“

Xiao Cheng's expression remained unchanged, still calm and composed, much milder than Wei Zhiren's coldness.

He said, ”I heard today is Mr. Wei's birthday.“

Wei Zhiren was stunned.

”Out of the blue, I didn't have a gift, so I had to boldly invite you to dinner to thank you for your long-term love and support.“

Xiao Cheng's smile became slightly more obvious.

”I also wish you a happy birthday, Mr. Wei.“

The author has something to say: Wei Zhiren: [suddenly cold.jpg][suddenly excited.jpg][suddenly crazy.jpg][suddenly exploding.jpg]

Xiao Cheng: Okay, okay, I know you like me, be good:)



The dark corporate president sat beside his brother, staring at his elder brother eating slowly.

Wei Ming ate leisurely in front of his incompetent younger brother, then wiped his hands.

Of course, Wei Ming had watched this younger brother, who was six years younger, grow up, and usually knew what Wei Zhiren was thinking just by his expression.

Now, this look of hopelessness most likely meant he had encountered some setback and had come to his elder brother for comfort—or perhaps to complain about being wronged and ask Wei Ming to confront the person on his behalf.

Generally, the latter was more likely.

Wei Ming glanced at his younger brother, reached out to take off Wei Zhiren's glasses and place them aside, ”Talk, what's the matter?“

Wei Zhiren looked mournful, ”I had dinner with Xiao Cheng.“

After a moment, he added, ”Just the two of us.“

Wei Ming raised an eyebrow, smiling, ”Isn't that good? Why do you look like that?“

”…“ Wei Zhiren fell silent.

Wei Zhiren felt like crying.

”But I never had a proper conversation with Xiao Cheng!“ Wei Zhiren rubbed his face, tugging his brother's sleeve, putting away his pitiful expression and adopting his aloof corporate president look.

The next second, he collapsed on the table, banging his head, ”Ahhhh, I had dinner with Xiao Cheng the whole time with this expression!“

Wei Ming: ”…“

That was somewhat pitiable.

”Ahh, I think it's over,“ Wei Zhiren lay like a fish on the table.

”Over?“ Wei Ming tapped the table beside his brother's head, ”What happened? Did Xiao Cheng reject you?“

”No,“ Wei Zhiren shook his head, burying his face in his sleeves, his voice muffled, ”Everything went smoothly. Xiao Cheng and his agent were very satisfied with the terms we offered.“

Wei Ming had personally crafted that proposal, so he knew how tempting the terms were for an actor.

Looking at his fish-like brother, he propped his chin up, teasing, ”So you couldn't control yourself.“

Wei Zhiren: ”…“

QAQ.

”…Really,“ Wei Ming almost burst into laughter.

But to consider his brother's feelings, he held back, ”What happened?“

”I said I liked Xiao Cheng in front of him before dinner,“ Wei Zhiren burst into tears, ”Wawawa! I'm definitely going to be abandoned by Cheng Cheng!“

Wei Ming, still holding his brother's clothes, was a bit confused.

He rubbed Wei Zhiren's head, silent for a long moment, then asked, ”You… Are you coming out?“

Wei Zhiren looked shocked, ”Coming out? Coming out of what?“

”You said you like Xiao Cheng,“ Wei Ming cut off Wei Zhiren's protest, looking at his brother mercilessly, ”Zheng, do you think I don't know you're jerking off to Xiao Cheng's poster?“

Wei Zhiren: ”…“

Bro, be a little more restrained. This is too blunt and embarrassing.

Wei Ming asked, ”If you can get hard for a man, do you think you're straight?“

…Of course not.

Wei Zhiren shrank his neck, not daring to speak.

Wei Ming spoke solemnly, ”Zheng, no matter what, don't come out before I get married, okay? Mom and Dad don't mind, but…“

Wei Zhiren looked at his brother carefully, ”But what?“

Wei Ming patted his brother's shoulder, ”But coming out will affect my marriage. Wait until I get married, then come out. Otherwise, because of you, I might not be able to pursue someone I like.“

Wei Zhiren: ”…“

Oh.

Bro, you're really my brother.

After giving his brother advice, Wei Ming thought for a moment, ”But with Xiao Cheng, I think the chances of us working together are still quite high.“

Wei Zhiren looked at his brother gloomily.

”You said you like him. What kind of hint is that in that circle? You should understand,“ Wei Ming rubbed his brother's head, ”Xiao Cheng has been in the industry for so long. He can't possibly not understand. Since he invited you to dinner, he's not against you hitting on him.“

”Really?!“

Wei Zhiren suddenly got excited.

”But Xiao Cheng said he invited me to dinner to thank me for my support over the years?“

Wei Ming rolled his eyes, ”Nonsense, you've done so much. One dinner can't erase everything? If you're so sweet, don't go out saying you're my brother.“

Wei Zhiren: ”…“

I didn't go around saying I was your brother, though.

Injustice.

Wei Ming pinched his brother's face, ”Xiao Cheng wouldn't be that shameless. He'll at least offer himself!“

”Bro, stop watching those ridiculous soap operas with Mom,“ Wei Zhiren looked at his brother with sympathy and pity, ”It lowers your IQ.“

”Rascal, you don't know what's good for you,“ Wei Ming kicked Wei Zhiren, ”Get lost.“

Wei Zhiren rolled away quickly.

Wei Zhiren trusted Wei Ming.

Because since he could remember, Wei Ming had


Chapter 15:
Zi Zhenzhen: Hahaha hahaha hahaha hahaha hahaha hahaha!

Xiao Cheng was sitting in the car heading back to the film city at this moment.

Having stayed up all night the previous day and been busy all day today, Xiao Cheng fell asleep the instant he got into the car.

His phone vibrated twice, and Xiao Cheng opened his eyes groggily, then pulled it out to glance at it.

The brightness of the phone screen was quite glaring in the dark car interior.

Liu Xiaomai was sitting in the passenger seat and, noticing the light, turned around.

”Just woke up? You look really tired.“

Xiao Cheng mumbled a response, unlocking the screen, ”Today's birthday person wanted to see me.“

Liu Xiaomai choked.

Then he said, ”I think Manager Wei and the one chatting with you aren't the same person.“

One used emoticons with great skill, while the other appeared to be serious, boring, and old-fashioned.

They were like two completely different people.

”I was surprised too,“ Xiao Cheng recalled Wei Zhenzhen's behavior today, chuckling lightly, ”He was just shy.“

Liu Xiaomai: ”…“

Shit, just shy.

Xiao Cheng didn't look at Liu Xiaomai, who was staring at him speechlessly, and instead lowered his head to tap the screen lightly.

Little Black Monkey: Are you happy?

Zi Zhenzhen: Happy! Knocked happy >3<!

Zi Zhenzhen: It's just that I might have scared Cheng a little [crying.jpg]

Little Black Monkey: What?

Wei Zhenzhen, looking at the messages from his friend, recalled the meal with Xiao Cheng and felt quite pained.

Zi Zhenzhen: When I'm working… well, I'm quite fierce.

Zi Zhenzhen: Seeing Xiao Cheng out of the blue left me feeling like an idiot, too nervous to speak or move _(:зゝ∠)_

Zi Zhenzhen: Ah, it was probably like a zombie, stiff [dog crying.jpg]

Little Black Monkey: …

Xiao Cheng, thinking about the scene with Wei Zhenzhen during the meal, didn't notice his stiffness.

He could, however, see that Wei Zhenzhen had been zoning out the whole time.

Wei Zhenzhen was still sobbing over his messages.

Zi Zhenzhen: I only said three things to Cheng during the meal!

Zi Zhenzhen: 1) Uh-huh; 2) Uh-huh; 3) I'm younger than you, no need for formal titles.

Zi Zhenzhen: … Ah.

Zi Zhenzhen: I wish I could die QAQ I made Cheng keep trying to find topics to talk about, and I even told him he was old!

Zi Zhenzhen: Waaaaaaah my Cheng!

Zi Zhenzhen: My Cheng must hate me!

Zi Zhenzhen: [crying in a ball.jpg]

Xiao Cheng looked at Wei Zhenzhen's messages and found it difficult to connect the person he was chatting with to the previously cold and taciturn Wei Zhenzhen.

You wouldn't think our Manager Wei had such an inner life.

Little Black Monkey: Don't worry.

Little Black Monkey: Xiao Cheng still wants to work with you.

Wei Zhenzhen looked at his friend's words and paused.

Zi Zhenzhen: Did Cheng tell you that?

Xiao Cheng raised an eyebrow.

Little Black Monkey: No, I guessed.

Zi Zhenzhen: Don't try to hide it from cute bunny lady's sharp eyes!

Zi Zhenzhen: [cute bunny lady's eyes suddenly sharpening.jpg]

Xiao Cheng laughed in the car.

Little Black Monkey: Alright, Cheng did tell me.

Little Black Monkey: Cheng said he was very grateful to you.

Little Black Monkey: He also said he was happy to have your support these years.

Little Black Monkey: If you weren't so cold, it would be even better.

Little Black Monkey: [petting dog head.gif]

Author's Note: Wei Zhenzhen: [pretending to be a sea cucumber.jpg]



Originally, he had been living a comfortable life. Although his superiors had disliked him for a long time, because of his own capabilities and Xiao Cheng's talents, the minor troubles his superiors caused him didn't matter much.

—After all, he had earned money and fame. Who cared whether his superiors were willing to promote him or give him a raise?

Liu Xiaomai had never relied on his company's salary to live.

He and Xiao Cheng had many ways to earn extra money.

Xiao Cheng had also connected with Weicheng, and although other people from film and entertainment companies still occasionally needed his help, Liu Xiaomai felt much more confident than before.

Previously, he had struggled to navigate the situation, but now he could sit back and play it cool, countering them with tai chi.

If there was any frustration, it was probably due to his weight gain, which had increased due to too much socializing lately.

Liu Xiaomai felt everything was going smoothly and only had to wait a month for Xiao Cheng's collaboration with Light and Shadow Media to end before he could quit and say goodbye to this big mess.

But he never expected that, with only a month left, someone would still be causing trouble.

Liu Xiaomai called Xiao Cheng to complain.

”Manager Xu, damn, Xu Rongxuan that idiot, dragged me to his office and scolded me, asking if I didn't want to work and wanted to quit.“

”I've wanted to quit for a long time! If it weren't for you getting cheated in Light and Shadow, I would have quit long ago!“

Liu Xiaomai sat on a roadside flower bed, his face full of anger.

”I had to keep smiling and argue with him, telling him about your unreasonable salary. I even pretended to be nice and said adjusting your salary would make us very satisfied, but what was the result?“

”The result was that he completely ignored what I said and just kept scolding me!“

”What's wrong with him? Just because he has a bit of money?“

Xiao Cheng listened to Liu Xiaomai's complaints from a small corner of the set.

”It's not just a bit of money, he's very rich,“ Xiao Yindi corrected, ”Rich enough to treat Light and Shadow however he wants without any care.“

”What the hell is this,“ Liu Xiaomai took out a box of cigarettes, lit one, and took a deep drag, ”I used to think he was a bit crazy, but at least he was a normal person. Now he's just manic.“

Xiao Cheng agreed, ”He's crazy.“

Liu Xiaomai exhaled a smoke ring, ”Pretty crazy.“

Xiao Yindi didn't say anything.

The agent finished the cigarette in silence, ”It's also my fault for letting him see me meeting people from Weicheng.“

In fact, his contract was almost up, and he had been feeling unhappy staying at the original company. Finding a new job secretly, though not very respectable, was a common unspoken secret in the industry, usually ignored.

Who knew Xu Rongxuan, that madman, would keep harping on this matter.

Liu Xiaomai ground out his cigarette butt on the ground.

He sighed, ”Xiao Cheng, be careful lately. I think Xu Rongxuan is about to snap.“

Xiao Cheng acknowledged, thought for a moment, and said, ”Just hand in your resignation, the one-month transition period will be perfect. Afterwards, you can go to Weicheng first to get familiar with things.“

Liu Xiaomai thought about it for a while and agreed.

And it turned out Liu Xiaomai was right.

A few days later, news spread that Xu Rongxuan had gone berserk in the company and even assaulted someone.

Some of Xiao Cheng's acquaintances in the industry, who knew he was planning to make a move, sent worried messages.

Xu Rongxuan was quite well-known in the industry.

He was fearless and unscrupulous in his actions, never hiding his interest in Xiao Cheng, but alas, he never succeeded.

Of course, to others, it seemed to be because of Wei Zeming supporting Xiao Cheng.

But in reality, it was simply because Xu Rongxuan couldn't beat Xiao Cheng.

Yes, Xu Rongxuan couldn't beat Xiao Cheng.

Since the night eight years ago when he first met Xiao Cheng and tried to seduce him, Xu Rongxuan had been beaten by Xiao Cheng.

Liu Xiaomai didn't even know about this matter.

Back then, Xiao Cheng had just started his career and didn't know many of the small rules.

The moment Xu Rongxuan attacked him from behind, Xiao Cheng threw him over his shoulder and even dislocated his hand with a snap.

And Xu Rongxuan was a real oddball. Instead of finding someone to beat Xiao Cheng up or making a scene, he kept sending people to attack Xiao Cheng until he finally understood. Then he clung to Xiao Cheng's contract, withholding his salary and resources, shamelessly being a bully.

Xu Rongxuan did have manic depression, that was true.

He was a capable senior manager when calm, but when provoked, he was easily angered and prone to violence.

Compared to the image of a company boss, Xu Rongxuan was more like a complete playboy—of the mad dog variety.


Chapter 16:
Yet, because Xu Rongxuan seemed not to mind Xiao Cheng beating him, he was pinned to the ground by Xiao Cheng for as long as he secretly stared at him.

Forget about any unwritten rules; apart from being beaten, Xu Rongxuan did not even touch Xiao Cheng's hand.

Xiao Cheng held the lunchbox provided by the production team, sitting on a small stool and replying to his friends’ concern with lowered eyes.

Still, our President Wei is the best.

Compared to Wei Zhen, who kept a stern face and kept his distance at work, the frenzied Xu Rongxuan was like a wriggling mudskipper in the mud, while Wei Zhen was like a floating cloud in the sky.

Xiao Cheng pocketed his phone and approached the director who was calling out to him.

”Need a reshoot?“ The Emperor of Acting looked at the scene on the screen.

There was nothing wrong with it.

”No,“ the director shook his head, took a couple of bites of his food, and asked while watching the scene play, ”Is everything okay with you and the Light and Shadow side? I heard that Boss Xu is being troublesome again.“

Xiao Cheng also took a couple of bites of his food, ”Mm, it's fine, just wait till the last month is over.“

”This production is almost wrapping up,“ the director glanced at the withering leaves outside the set and lowered his voice, ”You should have decided where you're going, by the way, I have a movie in the works and I want to talk to you in advance.“

The Emperor of Acting paused, shifting his gaze from the screen to the director.

After a while, he slowly said, ”I'm going to Weicheng.“

The director was taken aback, ”Where?“

Xiao Cheng explained, ”Weicheng, the one under the control of the Blue Star Group.“

The director was confused for a moment, ”You really are with Wei Ziming…“

”No,“ Xiao Cheng raised his eyebrows, reiterating, ”I have nothing to do with Wei Ziming.“

The director looked unconvinced.

Xiao Cheng closed the empty lunchbox in his hands and looked up at the director.

”I have nothing to do with Wei Ziming.“

As he spoke, the corners of his mouth curled slightly.

”I'd rather have something to do with his younger brother.“



In the conference room of Weicheng's Film Department, Wei Zhen sat upright in the chair at the head of the table, pushing up his glasses perched on his nose bridge.

His voice was cold, with no hint of emotion.

”Meeting adjourned.“

Wang, the special assistant, was tidying up the meeting records and documents on the side.

There were only half a month left until the contract between Xiao Cheng and Light and Shadow expired, and Xiao Cheng's intentions were very clear. Liu Xiaomai had already started making frequent appearances in the Film Department of Weicheng, beginning to get to know and hand over work to the team that was starting to take shape.

Most of the people in the Film Department were old hands that Wei Zhen had recruited with great effort from various film and entertainment companies. Upon learning that the first actor they were to take in was Xiao Cheng, they immediately started working hard.

—The new boss wasn't much of a pushover, and his cold, intimidating face made them dare not slack off.

Wei Zhen watched as the people from various departments in the Film Department left the meeting room with swift and efficient movements, finally relaxing a little.

Wang pushed the computer in front of Wei Zhen, the document filled with the meeting records from earlier.

Wei Zhen glanced at it, feeling his head pound.

He waved his hand, ”Print it out and give it to me.“

Wang nodded and looked at Wei Zhen again, hesitating to speak.

Wei Zhen turned his head to look at him, ”Just say what you have to say.“

Wang pursed his lips, ”President Wei, about Xiao Cheng…“

Wei Zhen paused, immediately understanding why his assistant had asked this question.

The attitude and handling of artists working in the company, as well as those favored by the boss, were certainly different.

For example, while ordinary artists needed to make an appointment to see the boss, those close to the boss could walk right in.

There were many such small details that were treated differently, and as a special assistant to the president, Wang needed to clarify this.

Wei Zhen stood up, pushing up his plain glasses, ”No special treatment is needed.“

Since my Cheng won't come looking for me on purpose anyway QAQ.

Wang breathed a sigh of relief, nodded, and picked up the documents and computer, following Wei Zhen out of the meeting room.

Although they had a Film Department, Wei Zhen's office was still on the ground floor.

President Wei Zhen entered his office and closed the door behind him.

For a well-known reason, Wei Zhen's office did not have a glass wall like many other company offices.

What separated Wei Zhen's office from the lobby was a solid wall, which blocked all gazes when closed.

The moment he entered, Wei Zhen took off his light jacket, sinking into the chair and letting out a long sigh.

Everything was going smoothly now, he just needed to wait for Xiao Cheng to arrive.

Wei Zhen relaxed fully, moved the mouse to activate the computer, and sipped his water while secretly watching the screen.

Xiao Cheng's fan group was always lively.

The only group Wei Zhen had joined consisted of long-time fans who had existed since Xiao Cheng debuted eight years ago. Wei Zhen was also the administrator of this group.

Just like many male actors, Xiao Cheng's active fans were mostly young women.

The topics of conversation in the group were often the girls’ secrets and emotional troubles, which could be a bit awkward to watch, but were usually harmonious and beautiful.

Wei Zhen watched the rapidly scrolling messages in the group and took a sip of water.

Transdimensional Love Cheng Cheng: Wow, the boss of Light and Shadow is tearing it up again, this time even targeting his own artist?

Huhu: ? What?

Transdimensional Love Cheng Cheng: This, look [web link]
Transdimensional Love Cheng Cheng: It seems to be saying that this artist named He Wenle secretly contacted other companies, and was called a white-eyed wolf. Honestly, I don't think Boss Xu has a big enough heart, bringing up such a thing even for a job switch…

Cheng Cheng's Bellybutton: I saw it! It's already number one on the trending list.

Huhu: Job switching is a common practice, but it's embarrassing to be caught by the former company, especially when the contract hasn't ended yet.

…

Wei Zhen paused, as he had been focusing on Light and Shadow Media recently, he reflexively tensed up at any news from them.

He clicked on the link.

The link led to a Weibo article with images, posted by the president of Light and Shadow Media, Xu Rongxuan.

The entire article was filled with sarcastic criticism of an artist who had a contract but secretly contacted other agencies, showing no professional integrity, and no gratitude towards his former company, calling him a white-eyed wolf.

The article ended with a statement that he would confront such white-eyed wolves one by one.

Wei Zhen was amazed by Xu Rongxuan's skill in using sarcasm to criticize people.

He was also amazed by Xu Rongxuan's petty nature.

Before being amazed, however, he first noticed the artist Xu Rongxuan was using as an example.

Wei Zhen looked at the photo in the article.

He recognized this boy.

He remembered him because Xiao Cheng had highly regarded him as a promising junior and praised his acting talent in public.

Due to his recent immersion in work and neglect of social media, Wei Zhen looked at the photo with a hint of conspiracy theory.

—Xiao Cheng is also leaving Light and Shadow.

Half a month ago, Liu Xiaomai said that Xu Rongxuan knew about it and had scolded him in his office.

So, was Xu Rongxuan's last sentence in the article a warning to Xiao Cheng, and by extension, to Weicheng, which had accepted him?

Wei Zhen narrowed his eyes.

…

This guy actually dared to warn him from afar?

Wei Zhen moved the mouse wheel with his slender index finger, then paused, his gaze falling on a stolen photo in the article.

The photo was blurry, but Wei Zhen immediately recognized who the person was who had contacted He Wenle.

The world is truly small.

Wei Zhen thought, then picked up his phone and dialed a number.

”Hello?“

Wei Zhen looked at the photo, rubbing his chin, ”Da Zi! I saw a report about He Wenle, did you guys meet with him?“

The person on the other end sighed, ”Yeah.“

”What happened?“ Wei Zhen asked.

”What could have happened, it's what happened,“ came a sound of a lighter being lit from the phone, ”Headsache, I thought it was a sure thing, but Xu Rongxuan suddenly went off.“

Wei Zhen paused in his drinking, ”Can you tell me what happened?“


Chapter 17:
At the other end of the phone, a voice responded, ”It's not some confidential matter, and it's also somewhat related to Xiao Cheng.“

”You're not ignorant of those shenanigans of Guang Ying. Xu Rongxuan can't touch Xiao Cheng, so he torments the people around Xiao Cheng. He Wenle is close to Xiao Cheng, so he was targeted by that madman Xu Rongxuan. He's a talented boy, but Xu Rongxuan has made his life particularly difficult. He doesn't have Xiao Cheng's support behind him, so he's thinking of finding a new home.“

”What seemed like a simple matter became complicated with Xu Rongxuan's involvement. How will we handle this? The impact on one's reputation and popularity is immense. I can't even take it on.“

Wei Zhen was full of surprise, ”Xu Rongxuan is ill like this and hasn't gone to the hospital?“

The voice at the other end of the phone sighed again, ”Who knows? I'm so worried right now.“

Wei Zhen was silent for quite a while, contemplating what to do if Xiao Cheng left and Xu Rongxuan caused more trouble.

Wei Zhen thought for a moment and asked, ”Dazi, how do you plan to handle this?“

At the other end of the phone, there was a pause before the reply, ”I wanted to go all out against Guang Ying, but my father doesn't allow it.“

”Hmm…“ Wei Zhen put down his cup, sliding his mouse around and clicking intermittently on the relevant news reports.

This matter was almost a disaster for He Wenle, who was currently on the rise.

However, if handled well, it could be salvaged, or even turned around to give Guang Ying a severe blow.

Wei Zhen thought of Xiao Cheng.

He was considering taking advantage of this momentum to strike a blow against Guang Ying.

Xu Rongxuan dared to issue warnings from afar, so if he didn't retort, he would be scolded by his elder brother when he got home.

Wei Zhen didn't want to be scolded by his elder brother because he hadn't been spanked in many years.

He didn't want to relive the humiliation of being spanked again.

Since the other party had already challenged him, he might as well take this opportunity to really blacken Guang Ying's name, allowing Xiao Cheng to come to Weichi City in glory and dignity.

Wei Zhen thought about it and lightly tapped the table.

He hoped that everyone would know that Xiao Cheng was leaving Guang Ying and that everyone would celebrate Xiao Cheng's departure from Guang Ying with joy!

All of this was for the sake of saving the incomparably handsome and extraordinarily adorable Cheng Gongju!

Wei Zhen pursed his lips and asked into the phone, ”Dazi, do you want to stir things up?“

There was a moment of silence on the other end, then excitement, ”What kind of trouble?“

Wei Zhen truly admired his comrade's excitement at the thought of stirring things up!

He licked his lips and revealed a bright smile.

”What else can we stir up?“

Wei Zhen said excitedly.

”Of course, we'll stir up Xu Rongxuan!“



He wore sunglasses and a mask, with a baseball cap covering his head, sneaking into the office building where Weichi City was located. Following Wang Tezhu's cautious and suspicious gaze, he went upstairs with him.

Li Yadai had a USB drive in his pocket, filled with dirt on Xu Rongxuan obtained from his group of friends.

The circle of these rich second-generation elites in City B wasn't very large or small.

Rotten sons and daughters always got into trouble; countless times, they had done foolish things when their minds were unclear, relying on their families to clean up and suppress the news.

However, while the outside world might suppress the news, within this group of people who hung out together, the news couldn't be suppressed.

Who did what foolish thing, how their families suppressed it—ask these people, and they could recount it with great detail.

And they would even show pictures while they talked.

Dragging each other down within this group wasn't uncommon; they had plenty of dirt on each other and weren't hesitant to spread it.

Li Yadai and Wei Zhen had once been part of this group, but Wei Zhen found his life's purpose and stopped contacting them.

Li Yadai, on the other hand, maintained excellent relations with these wealthy and idle young gentlemen due to his family's focus on the entertainment industry.

So Wei Zhen didn't hesitate to entrust the task of gathering dirt on Xu Rongxuan to Li Yadai.

Li Yadai, upon receiving the order, worked with extraordinary efficiency. He knew that such matters were time-sensitive; missing the window would render it futile.

He had worked hard to poach He Wenle, but Xu Rongxuan's sudden intervention infuriated Li Yadai, who had never suffered such a setback. However, he couldn't get support from his family to go all out against Guang Ying.

It was still good to have a comrade.

Li Yadai burst into Wei Zhen's office, slamming the door shut.

Wei Zhen's fingers paused on the keyboard as he looked up at Li Yadai.

He pushed up his glasses and said coldly, ”Come. Be good and don't make a big commotion.“

Li Yadai threw the USB drive to Wei Zhen, sat on the sofa, and took off his disguise.

He casually crossed his legs, looking at Wei Zhen with amazement, ”It's still amazing no matter how many times I see it.“

The domineering CEO Wei Zhen took the USB drive and plugged it in, ignoring his comrade and instructing the secretary who had just entered to call the general manager of the public relations department.

Li Yadai leaned in, watching Wei Zhen sift through a pile of photos on the computer screen and back them up, and asked, ”What are you going to do?“

Wei Zhen snickered, pushed up his glasses, and opened another file.

It contained screenshots of deleted Weibo posts.

”Actually, I declared war on Xu Rongxuan last night,“ Wei Zhen rested his chin on his hand, his expression one of great satisfaction, ”But it seems he didn't take it seriously.“

Li Yadai was bewildered, ”What did you do?“

”I passed on what you sent me last night to some online media outlets,“ Wei Zhen tapped the table, ”But Guang Ying's public relations seems to have treated these small outlets’ messages as mere attempts to ride the wave, deleting or blocking them without paying attention.“

Li Yadai looked at the screenshots Wei Zhen had taken of the small outlets, speechless, ”… I would think it's riding the wave too.“

Fan bases of only tens of thousands of people could barely be noticed.

Wei Zhen turned to his comrade, ”Dazi.“

Li Yadai, ”…?“

Wei Zhen mimicked his brother's tone, speaking seriously to his comrade, ”Pride is the first step towards destruction.“

Li Yadai, ”…?“

Meow meow meow meow?

Could you speak in plain words?

Wei Zhen didn't want to talk to his comrade, whose intelligence seemed offline.

He looked at the public relations department manager who had entered after knocking, regained his composure, and pulled out a file of about ten pages from his drawer.

”I want the negative publicity Xiao Cheng might face when he leaves Guang Ying and comes to Weichi City to be minimized,“ Wei Zhen pointed to the file.

The public relations department manager was taken aback.

He picked up the file on the table, which contained the public opinion trends regarding He Wenle's incident from yesterday morning until that morning.

There were clear signs of manipulation.

”To whitewash He Wenle and pave the way for Xiao Cheng.“

Wei Zhen's expression was calm, his tone indifferent and composed, succinctly stating his requirements.

He then handed the USB drive to the manager.

”The first battle for the public relations department, fight well.“

The public relations department manager took the USB drive and nodded, a smile on his face, ”Understood, Mr. Wei.“

Li Yadai watched the manager leave, somewhat surprised by such a comrade.

”How do you usually work?“

Meeting Wei Zhen's gaze, he stretched his face, looking somewhat sinister.

Li Yadai pointed to his current expression, ”Like this.“

Wei Zhen, ”…“

Is it that ugly?

The domineering CEO Wei Zhen touched his face, recalling that he had used this expression to face Xiao Cheng earlier, feeling like the world had fallen apart.

Wah wah QAQ.

Wei Zhen laid his head on the table, wanting to cry bitterly.

Li Yadai was bewildered; his comrade's mood swing had come too suddenly, leaving him at a loss.

Wei Zhen had transformed from a domineering CEO to a useless flounder in an instant.

He whined, extending his flounder fins to click the mouse, entering a pink-backgrounded forum.

Li Yadai cautiously approached Wei Zhen.

”What are you doing?“ he asked.

Wei Zhen started tapping the keyboard.

”Let Xu Rongxuan and Guang Ying's public relations department feel the anger of a flounder!“


Chapter 18:
Wei Zhiren, his face twisted in sorrow and rage, said, ”When I, this poor salted fish, personally stepped into the fray, Xu Rongxuan, that little brat, was still pestering his parents for candy!“

Li Yadá: ”……“

Daring not to speak.

Wei Zhiren selected a few pictures and posted them directly.

[Rational Discussion] Were these deleted items infringe on some president's fragile and delicate nerves?

No.1 Uninformed OP

OP, seeing the commotion on Weibo about the H surnamed actor, was very curious about Xu Boss, who had allegedly seduced him, and searched for more information on Weibo. Since he couldn't finish reading everything at once, he gave each post a thumbs up, shared it, and marked it to read later.

Yesterday he searched, and today after a good night's sleep…

Chapter 16

After posting the thread, Wei Zhiren immediately sent it to the general manager of the PR depart

ment via the company's internal communication software.

Li Yadá looked on in disbelief.

”Aren't your PR team in the film department newly formed? Aren't you afraid of leaking information by posting so much?“

Wei Zhiren flapped his fish fins and glanced at his companion.

He said with sympathy, ”Foolish child, those are all people borrowed from my brother.“

Li Yadá: ”……“

Ah, having a大腿 is great.

Li Yadá felt a pang of jealousy and even voiced it, ”Having a大腿 to hold onto is great. How can I even think of dying when my family won't allow it.“

Wei Zhiren snorted derisively, ”If you're not satisfied, go find one for yourself.“

Li Yadá laughed, ”Hold onto my brother?“

Wei Zhiren slammed the table, ”Get lost, my brother is mine!“

Li Yadá expressed his envy and jealousy, feeling extremely wronged.

The Rabbit Zone had high traffic. Although it had once been called a garbage dump of the entertainment industry for certain reasons, it was still a good place to ride the wave and build a following.

Because it was an anonymous forum, many people were fishing and spreading malicious rumors, with a mix of all kinds of people. Many so-called insiders would make up unfounded stories and swear they had seen it with their own eyes.

And as they say, three people make a tiger. A false story, repeated often enough, would eventually become ”truth“ – a fabrication of reality.

Wei Zhiren didn't choose to post on Sea Corner, where one needed pictures and proof to gain credibility, but instead posted on the Rabbit Zone, having completely thrown off his inhibitions and preparing to give Xu Rongxuan a hard hit.

The PR department's response was swift. Soon after the post was up, under the layers of innocent bystanders, more content began to appear.

The Rabbit Zone really has no walls. Can the freeloaders show some common sense? The search function can find a bunch of keywords.

Oh, the boss has more than just a bit of dirt on him.

The original poster used to work at Light and Shadow and swore on my C-cup bra that Xu Rongxuan, President Xu, must be mentally ill.

I think it's bipolar disorder…

His secretary never recruits girls because they would get beaten.

Even so, few secretaries could last more than six months because they couldn't handle the beatings ==

This doesn't need verification, right? Anyone who worked at Light and Shadow for more than a year knows this.

No.79 ==

Holy crap, is what you're saying true?

Why have I never heard of this before?

No.80 ==

I know about this!

A few years ago, an employee at Light and Shadow dug it up, and the post was deleted the next day, along with the related keywords being blocked, making it impossible to search for.

So now when I see a bunch of men and women on Weibo calling Xu Boss their husband, I think they really don't care about being beaten up[x

There is evidence of this incident. But they forcefully deleted the post. If you look closely, you can still find some traces hidden in some threads_(:зゝ∠)_

I saved a screenshot of that post back then!

I also want to pay tribute to the brave original poster who got fired for exposing the truth.

…

Wei Zhiren refreshed the post and pointed at it with Li Yadá, both looking at the screen with amusement.

Wei Zhiren's fish fins patted his companion's shoulder, ”You couldn't even gather this dirt, you're useless, Dazi.“

Li Yadá felt wronged, ”I'm not in this business, these are the PR department's duties, how does it concern me!“

Wei Zhiren snorted, typing a reply to demonstrate he wasn't just fishing and running away.

Unfortunately, your concerns are correct.

Xu Rongxuan definitely beat up stars working at Light and Shadow. Someone on Zhihu dug it up.

Evidence: [Picture][Picture][Picture][Picture]

Just these seven were caught on camera, and who knows how many more were not…

Seeing this, Wei Zhiren pushed his glasses and copied the post address, sending it to Xiao Cheng's fan group.

Zhenzhen Zhen: [Web Link]

Wǒ Chēng Tiānyán: Oh my god, I actually saw the Three Zhen Goddess!

Wǒ Chēng Měihūa: It's a god!

Zhenzhen Zhen: [Smile]

Zhenzhen Zhen: I think everyone should read that post.

Across Dimensions Love Cheng Cheng: As ordered!

Not long after Wei Zhiren finished speaking, a hip-hop monkey avatar appeared in the bottom right corner.

President Wei paused and turned to Li Yadá sitting beside him.

”Dazi, keep an eye on Weibo.“ He pointed to the laptop beside him.

Li Yadá glanced at the jumping avatar in the bottom right corner, pursing his lips.

”Not letting me see? Your little lover?“

Wei Zhiren sighed, ”You should eat more brain, it would do you good.“

Li Yadá felt like he was being attacked.

He sat on the sofa, holding the laptop, feeling extremely wronged.

Wei Zhiren opened the chat window.

Little Black Monkey: [Picture] This post?

Little Black Monkey: [Black Man Question Mark.jpg]

Little Black Monkey: My intuition tells me you did this.

Little Black Monkey: [Rabbit Beauty's eyes suddenly turned sharp.jpg]

Little Black Monkey: What are you trying to do?

Wei Zhiren blinked.

Zhenzhen Zhen: Monkey Jee, you set me as special attention! I found out!

Zhenzhen Zhen: [I'm Super Cute.jpg]

Zhenzhen Zhen: Monkey Jee, it's rare to see you this excited.

Little Black Monkey: Because the topic at Light and Shadow is very sensitive [I'm Super Cute.jpg]

Wei Zhiren watched his companion use more and more emojis, pushing his glasses and feeling very happy.

Zhenzhen Zhen: You've been found out.

Zhenzhen Zhen: Yes, it was me causing trouble! [Proud.jpg]

Little Black Monkey: …He Wenle's affair?

Zhenzhen Zhen: No, He Wenle's case was completely due to Xu Rongxuan losing his mind.

Zhenzhen Zhen: Monkey Jee, you actually suspected me!

Zhenzhen Zhen: [Ah, I fell in the salty fish life.jpg]


Chapter 19:
Xiao Cheng held his phone and let out a sigh of relief when he reached this point.

His drama was nearly finished. Recently, he only had some additional and re-shot scenes to complete, and the rest of the time, he basically just sat by the side waiting for his turn.

Emperor Xiao Shadow stepped back, flipping through the post and pursed his lips.

Black Monkey: So, what are you planning to do?

Zi Zhen Zhen Zhen: I want to use this opportunity to make Xiao Cheng come to Weicheng in a grand and glorious manner!

Zi Zhen Zhen Zhen: And help my friend clear He Wenle's name.

Black Monkey: ?

Black Monkey: So, you want to go head-to-head with Light and Shadow?

Zi Zhen Zhen Zhen: Bingo!

Black Monkey: Xu Rongxuan is very sick. Be careful; he might come looking for you and give you a brick to the head.

Zi Zhen Zhen Zhen: Oh my gosh, I'm so scared [Elderly Indifferent Clapping.gif]

Black Monkey: …

Zi Zhen Zhen Zhen: [As long as I make one phone call, ten thousand queers will forcibly fuck him.jpg]

Black Monkey: …

Xiao Cheng looked at the phone screen and decided to have Liu Xiaomai stay in Weicheng recently to keep track of the situation at all times.

Wei Zhenzhen's intentions were clearly evident; he was using the fans of the artists under Light and Shadow to create public opinion, turning the criticism aimed at He Wenle onto Xu Rongxuan.

After all, Xu Rongxuan himself had countless scandals, and with a little guidance and exposure, it would be easy to gather a large number of well-equipped internet armies from various sides.

The cost was low, and the returns were high. It could also drag Xu Rongxuan down and pull Light and Shadow into it.

It had to be said that this plan was well thought out.

Xiao Cheng sighed.

Black Monkey: Forget about the forced fucking, do whatever else makes you happy :)))



Xiao Cheng's fan group was also in an uproar.

Once their favorite idol was involved, the power unleashed by the fans was enough to make anyone back off.

”What's the point of saying something in this post?“ Li Yadai sucked on a box of strawberry milk, ”These kinds of things will be forgotten if left alone for a week or two.“

”This post doesn't matter,“ Wei Zhenzhen didn't even lift his head, ”Just treat this post as a fuse, and we'll delete it later with some money.“

Li Yadai sucked a large mouthful of milk, ”Delete it?“

”Yes, once these things blow up, the only options are to clarify or admit fault; deleting the post is absolutely not acceptable.“ Wei Zhenzhen scrolled through the post with his mouse, ”Xu Rongxuan won't be unaware of this. Therefore, he won't provoke the masses, so I'll do it for him.“

Wei Zhenzhen pushed his glasses, ”In any case, at this time, everyone will think it's Light and Shadow deleting the post, and it has nothing to do with anyone else.“

Li Yadai stared dumbfounded at his friend, the box of strawberry milk in his hand ”thunk“ falling onto the table.

He righted the fallen box of strawberry milk and after a while, his voice hoarse, ”…You're so cunning.“

”Just average,“ Wei Zhenzhen modestly accepted his friend's praise (?), while watching the fans in the fan group one by one appear and declare their willingness to spread the word, and with a proxy IP, he typed away, stirring the pot.

Feeling terrified upon reflection.

Such a company has stood in the entertainment industry for so many years; I thought that after the HK entertainment industry was controlled by the mafia for money laundering and actors were beaten and abused, it would never happen again…

Wei Zhenzhen flipped through the posts and then checked the official website and Weibo of Light and Shadow, but did not see any clarification statement.

It's almost time to delete it, Wei Zhenzhen thought, casually refreshed the page, and saw the prompt that the post had been deleted.

Wei Zhenzhen: ”…“

The PR department's actions were swift.

No wonder he was working under Life Winner Xiaoming.

Wei Zhenzhen tsked twice, opened the constantly flashing QQ group, and saw a multitude of fans going crazy as soon as he opened it.

The general manager of the PR department sent him some web links.

Wei Zhenzhen glanced through them and found that they contained various popular portal websites.

He randomly clicked on a few, and the content was largely the same, discussing the recently deleted post and attaching many screenshots from the original post.

The PR department was truly… impressive.

Wei Zhenzhen calculated the time; at this rate, they could sit back and watch the show by dinner time.

”Really, things have erupted on Weibo,“ Li Yadai carried his computer and dragged a chair to sit beside Wei Zhenzhen.

His homepage was full of marketing accounts related to the entertainment industry questioning why the messages about Light and Shadow Media posted yesterday had been deleted.

They were very unhappy about it.

The deliberately forwarded messages spread extremely fast. Wei Zhenzhen didn't know how the PR department had operated it, but when he refreshed his homepage again, he saw that the keyword of Light and Shadow Media Xu Rongxuan had topped the trending list, and the marketing account that he had previously called an idiot had posted a Weibo.

Eight-circle exposé: My post from yesterday was deleted as well… This is the rhythm of not allowing anyone to speak for He Wenle? This is truly terrifying. When did changing jobs become tied to one's character? People climb to higher places, and water flows downhill. Most people who want to change jobs find a new employer first, right? He Wenle didn't leak any company secrets; it was just a normal job change. Some people are willing to pay the breach of contract fee, but your company keeps holding on without any meaning, and even deletes the relevant topic posts? For lack of thought.

This marketing account had over a million fans and was extremely popular. This Weibo without any topics, but hitting every hot spot, quickly gained a large number of forwards and comments at a visible speed.

Wei Zhenzhen thought of himself being hung by this account before, and now it was helping him, deeply feeling that having money was truly good.

”You're brother's people are really useful,“ Li Yadai pursed his lips, ”Can I dig a few away?“

Wei Zhenzhen opened a box of vanilla milk and continued refreshing Weibo, ”Digging people, you have to ask my brother.“

Li Yadai sighed, knowing it was a lost cause.

I Peeling My Skin I'm Happy: #He Wenle Breach of Contract# A certain president might be shouted at by net husband every day, forgetting who they are, everyone in the industry knows the treatment at Light and Shadow. If they had backing, they would have left long ago. With such a soft temper staying in your company for four years before looking for a new job, they must have been unable to bear it anymore. Reflect on yourself, Mr. Xu, what have you done these years?

Legend of Industry People: #Light and Shadow Media Xu Rongxuan# Just saw a post in the rabbit zone that made my heart race, wondering who had the courage to expose the unspeakable one at Light and Shadow, and indeed, the post was deleted [doge], fortunately, I was smart enough to save the archives, coming to join in a little, I'll show you some treasures. [Images] [Images] [Images] [Images]

Inside and Outside the Industry: A net friend anonymously private messaged industry brother, giving a pile of shocking stuff. A private vice of a certain company president, the images are large, traffic users be careful. [Images] [Images] [Images] [Images] [Images]

Wei Zhenzhen read these Weibos with great interest, propped his chin on his hand, and clicked into Xu Rongxuan and Light and Shadow Media's Weibo homepage.

Sure enough, after an afternoon of fermentation, Xu Rongxuan and Light and Shadow's Weibo comments were filled with curses.

Furious fans were irrational; they cursed Xu Rongxuan and Light and Shadow under their posts, and the more sensible ones directly singled out Light and Shadow's crisis PR for a thorough attack.

Wei Zhenzhen watched for a while and felt refreshed.

Li Yadai pushed Wei Zhenzhen from the side, pointing at the laptop screen.


Chapter 20:
On the screen was a Weibo post.

The cleaning lady at the film city: #He Wenle Breach of Contract# I've been watching this for two days now, and I feel quite sympathetic towards He Wenle. This time, it's not about taking money to whitewash; driven by the last bit of conscience I have as a marketing account, I'm going to uncover what resources He Wenle has received and what kind of life he has led in the four years since his debut. As for the internal matters of a certain company, I'm not very clear on them, but everything in this article has been verified by me or witnessed with my own eyes. Everyone can form their own opinions. [Weibo Article]

The article states that He Wenle, who has been in the industry for four years, has grown into a young idol with a million fans. Despite attending many events, he still relies on his family's financial support.

The vivid and detailed description portrays the scarcity of resources He Wenle has received and the impoverished nature of his life.

It truly brings tears to one's eyes upon hearing and seeing it.

Wei Zhiru sighed.

”This is a textbook case of whitewashing.“

Li Yida rolled his eyes, ”Your Xiao Cheng is even worse off.“

”It's my fault,“ Wei Zhiru's expression fell, ”During the most difficult period for him, I was engrossed in my studies. Although there were investments, they were too few in number… I couldn't protect him from the start.“

Listening to Wei Zhiru's sorrowful rambling, Li Yida felt a bit envious. He took the computer back and asked directly, ”So why don't you use Xiao Cheng's misfortune?“

Wei Zhiru looked at his friend in disbelief, ”You actually want Xiao Cheng to play the victim? Are you joking?“

Li Yida insisted that he was not joking.

Wei Zhiru shook his head, ”I wouldn't use Xiao Cheng's misfortune. His cool and aloof image as an emperor of acting is quite perfect; we shouldn't start by tormenting and playing with his fans. He stands at a different height compared to He Wenle and doesn't need to play the victim or be cute to gain sympathy. His works speak for him. He Wenle is different; he needs to divert attention, and since he's on a path of being cheerful, adding a tag of being bullied and pitiful will earn him a bunch of devoted fans.“

As soon as he finished speaking, Li Yida stared at the computer screen and sighed.

”But really, someone has already shattered the image of your Xiao Cheng.“

Wei Zhiru: ”…“

[Black Question Mark.jpg]

Li Yida had an expression that was hard to watch, and he turned the computer around again.

Director Xu Qingwen: #Guangying Media Xu Rongxuan# I might as well take this opportunity to say it. I've known Xiao Cheng for a bit more than nine years, ever since he started running b-bit parts in my productions. He's someone I've watched grow up. But you probably don't know that the contract Xiao Cheng has with Guangying has always been a rookie contract.

To be frank, throughout his journey to becoming a box office and ratings担当 emperor of acting, the only contribution Guangying has made is discovering him and letting him stay in the training camp for two years.

After his debut? Not hindering him was already fortunate for Guangying.

No resources, no pay, no contract modifications. At least He Wenle still has family support, but what about Xiao Cheng? His family didn't support him in this industry and didn't offer any help.

In the first year of Xiao Cheng's debut, why would he run five or six sets a day? It wasn't that he didn't know the hard work; it was because running sets allowed him to grab lunch and dinner!

To be blunt, anyone wanting to leave a company like Guangying, whether through secret contacts or being openly poached, I would be the first to support it. Not only support, but I would also cheer and celebrate!

Wei Zhiru's vision went black, and he felt blood rising to his throat, almost ready to burst out.

The author has something to say: Director: ? Is there anything wrong?

Wei Zhiru: You guess? [Leaning forward, let me show you something amazing.jpg]



The most prominent example is He Wenle today.

This tactic has been overused in the entertainment industry, but even the most vulgar and worn-out methods cannot withstand the strong emotions of fans who care about their idols. Therefore, this tactic often achieves its goal.

Especially the first time it's used, its effect is miraculous.

This can be seen from the骂声 under the official Weibo of Guangying Media and Xu Rongxuan's Weibo.

A unanimous expression of sympathy for their beloved idol, questioning Xu Rongxuan and Guangying.

However, for the packaging teams behind actors and artists who maintain their image, this tactic is never the first choice when facing events.

Those who once tasted the sweetness of tormenting fans began to use the fans’ sympathy and love to deceive their emotions repeatedly, resulting in being exposed by angry fans.

Since then, artists who had used such tactics, whether truly wronged or simply tragic marketing, were all mocked one by one and branded with a pillar of shame.

Therefore, Wei Zhiru was extremely opposed to bringing up Xiao Cheng's past.

It wasn't about the image issue, but the fact that Xiao Cheng's critics were too active. They found this small issue and were delighted to talk about it for years!

It was like a dog that hadn't eaten for half a month seeing a bone; it wouldn't be able to stop barking and jumping at it.

It might even be exaggerated, branding Xiao Cheng with a pillar of shame that occasionally still appeared on the homepage of the rabbit area!

Just thinking about that scene made Wei Zhiru feel like he was about to explode.

Xiao Cheng had worked hard for many years, carefully controlling his words and actions, avoiding much criticism, but now it was coming to him, and such a thing was revealed.

Wei Zhiru's eyes went dark, and he wanted to go to the film city to beat up the director immediately.

Li Yida looked worried at the dazed Wei Zhiru, ”Are you okay?“

Wei Zhiru took a deep breath, ”…I'm fine.“

”What do we do now?“ Li Yida pointed at the computer screen.

”What else can we do?“ Wei Zhiru sighed and typed instructions to the public relations department.

”First, divert the fans’ attention, get them to attack Guangying, and quickly create several summary posts emphasizing Xiao Cheng's achievements and acting skills. Don't let the fans think he's playing the victim… That's all I can think of for now.“

Wei Zhiru took off his glasses and pinched his nose bridge, ”Distort the facts, give Xiao Cheng a tag of Inspirational Emperor, better than being branded with a pillar of shame by critics.“

Li Yida felt that Wei Zhiru was truly putting in a lot of effort for Emperor Xiao.

He propped his chin, ”You're so proficient; do you often do this kind of thing?“

”Not often.“

Wei Zhiru shook his head. After seeing the response from the public relations department, he let out a small sigh of relief.

”Xiao Cheng acts very cautiously; a paparazzo followed him for over two years and didn't capture any negative material.“

That was quite rare.

Li Yida vaguely responded, ”You don't even pay that much attention to yourself.“

”Of course not, because I'm not as good as Cheng,“ Wei Zhiru rubbed his face, put on his glasses again, and pointed at Li Yida's computer screen, ”Director Xu Qingwen's phone number, you should have it.“

Li Yida nodded, ”Yes.“

Wei Zhiru reached for the phone on the table, preparing to call the famous straightforward director in the industry to comfort him.

But just as Li Yida reported the first three digits of the number, the office door was knocked.

Wei Zhiru froze, directly kicking his friend and the chair he was sitting on out of the way, quickly tidying up his appearance, and raising his voice coldly, ”Come in.“

Li Yida, along with the chair, slid out very far, turning in circles, looking dumbfounded.

Li Yida: ”…“

He steadied the chair, held the computer, and looked at his friend who had changed expressions in a second with a heart-wrenching gaze.

Wei Zhiru, you'll easily lose me if you keep doing this, you know?

Wei Zhiru claimed he didn't know.

He knew nothing.

Because Xiao Cheng was here.

Wei Zhiru, who was still adjusting his tie, tightened his hand.

He stared blankly at the two people who had entered, looking past Liu Xiaomai in front, to the person behind her wearing a baseball cap, hoodie, jeans, and sneakers, with sunglasses and a mask covering most of his face.

Hope no one asks why Xiao Cheng only showed an ear tip and Wei Zhiru could still recognize him.

[The Unbreakable Love of a Fan.jpg]

Liu Xiaomai stepped back a bit and closed the door.

Xiao Cheng took off the sunglasses and mask, looked at the stunned Wei Zhiru behind the desk, nodded, and said, ”Mr. Wei.“


Chapter 21:
Wei Zhiren reluctantly came to his senses, reflexively turning his head to glance at the photo frame on the table.

Then he heaved a sigh of relief.

Thankfully, it was covered up.

Otherwise, if Xiao Cheng discovered his photograph on his desk, so beautifully framed… Oh, just thinking about it made him feel embarrassed to the core.

Wei Zhiren held his head high with a composed nod, his brow slightly furrowed, as if he was somewhat displeased, then he responded with a single syllable: ”Mm.“

Mm!

Mm, kiss my big brother, mm!

Still frowning!

Why can't I control my face and my mouth!

Wei Zhiren's expression was tense, his mind was collapsing, and he desperately wanted to strangle himself.

”Since we are nearing the end of the shoot and have some leeway in time, I came over to take a look,“ Xiao Cheng appeared very natural and relaxed—excluding his unwavering gaze at Wei Zhiren.

Wei Zhiren was on edge, every tiny pore screaming with tension and embarrassment.

Xiao Cheng looked at Wei Zhiren, whose expression was devoid of emotion, demeanor composed, the aloof CEO. He felt that the little black monkey would be getting a treasure trove of tearful emoticons again.

Thinking about it, a faint smile crept onto Xiao Cheng's face.

He spoke, ”I came specifically to find you because the director's Weibo post was something I asked him to help with.“

Wei Zhiren was taken aback, his frown deepening.

”The Little Wheat said the company is having issues with Yin Guang. I thought my involvement could accelerate the situation, so I took the liberty of asking the director to share the details. Director Xu is renowned for his honesty in the industry, straightforward, and his words are highly credible, so…“

”So, why did you do this?“ Wei Zhiren interrupted Xiao Cheng directly, looking at him as he stood up, hands on the table, leaning forward with a sense of authority.

His voice rose slightly, ”This matter does not require sacrifice, nor does it necessitate adding obstacles to your future. Are you happy with what you've done?“

Wei Zhiren pursed his lips tightly after speaking, ”Foolish!“

Xiao Cheng felt baffled by Wei Zhiren's attitude.

He couldn't understand why Wei Zhiren was angry.

Clearly, his revelation would expedite the situation and tarnish Yin Guang's reputation, but Wei Zhiren seemed quite unhappy, even a bit angry.

Xiao Cheng remained silent for a long time. Liu Xiaomai, who had been following him, was about to speak up, but he stopped her.

Xiao Cheng pondered for a while. He was quite confident about his standing in Wei Zhiren's heart.

In Wei Zhiren's mind, his job was secondary to Xiao Cheng.

Wei Zhiren couldn't possibly be angry over work.

The only reason for his anger must be that Xiao Cheng would suffer or be affected.

Thinking this way, the only reason for Wei Zhiren's anger could be the negative impact on him from this revelation.

Xiao Cheng was abnormally confident. After having a clear idea in his mind, he rallied his spirits, ”Mr. Wei, I don't care about the reputation.“

”But I…“ Wei Zhiren swallowed the words almost about to escape his lips.

He pursed his lips tightly, relaxing his grip on the desk slightly, lifting his hand to push up his glasses, ”Xiao Cheng.“

The Shadow Emperor gestured for him to speak, indicating he was listening attentively.

Wei Zhiren forced himself to remain calm, adjusting his glasses again, ”What's done is done. You don't need to reopen your wounds, pitifully begging for sympathy and attention. The company… does not want your reputation tarnished. Such lowly means, you will never need to use them.“

Xiao Cheng was taken aback, looking into Wei Zhiren's rosy eyes hidden behind his glasses, as if he caught a glimpse of a soft concern in those cold eyes.

The Shadow Emperor stared blankly at the person before him, feeling utterly at a loss, faced with such raw tenderness and care.

After a long time, he slowly responded to Wei Zhiren's expectation, ”Mr. Wei, you trust and wish to protect me. I am grateful and happy.“

After speaking, Xiao Cheng sighed lightly.

”But, I also want to repay you.“

Wei Zhiren froze in place, staring at Xiao Cheng, unsure how to react.

”When I asked Director Xu, I didn't think much about it; I just wanted to help you,“ Xiao Cheng spoke with utmost sincerity, ”I apologize for taking the liberty of causing trouble for the company.“

Wei Zhiren: ”…“

Aaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

What am I doing!

Waaah, my idol looks like he's about to cry QAQ

Wei Zhiren clenched his fists, digging into the sleeves of his shirt, his thumb nervously rubbing the table.

He pursed his lips, his face elongating, ”It wasn't that troublesome.“

Seeing Wei Zhiren's softened attitude, Xiao Cheng smiled, ”So, Mr. Wei, you forgive me this time?“

Wei Zhiren was momentarily stunned by that smile, feeling awkward for a long time.

Then he cleared his throat, coldly saying, ”No repetition.“

”Yes, no repetition.“ Xiao Cheng nodded, then walked to the desk.

He was slightly taller than Wei Zhiren, and in Wei Zhiren's current position, leaning forward, this small height difference made him appear somewhat dominant.

The domineering Shadow Emperor was very satisfied with this angle.

”My play is wrapping up tomorrow, coincidentally it's the weekend. Mr. Wei, do you have time to have dinner together?“



My idol is inviting me to dinner again!

Does he have feelings for me!

>v<

Hahaha!

Mr. Wei, the aloof CEO, was filled with pink bubbles.

He pushed his glasses up, then coldly refused his idol.

”Sorry.“ Wei Zhiren pushed his glasses, ”I have plans on the weekend.“

After speaking, to increase credibility, he nodded at Li Yadai, who was quietly standing by like a wallflower, indicating that this was the person he had a date with.

Li Yadai, who was already feeling like a wallflower being stabbed, was bewildered for a moment, looking at Wei Zhiren, and under the implied threat from his friend, nodded with a sense of grievance.

Wei Zhiren was satisfied, retracting his gaze, and looked back at Xiao Cheng. Seeing his idol slightly disappointed, he felt a twinge of pain and sincerely repeated, ”Sorry.“

Xiao Cheng shook his head and took out his phone.

”Then, Mr. Wei, would you mind if I add you on WeChat?“

Of course not!

Wei Zhiren quickly pulled out his phone from the bottom of the document pile and, like lightning, added his idol on WeChat, but declined to allow the other party to view his Moments.

Because some parts of his Moments praising his idol were too blatant and embarrassing.

Xiao Cheng would surely block him immediately if he saw them.

Luckily, Xiao Cheng didn't have the habit of checking others’ Moments, so after confirming the addition, he put away his phone and said he was going with Liu Xiaomai to explore the new company, leaving first.

As he left, Xiao Cheng stood by the door, seemed to remember something, and turned to look at Li Yadai, who was holding the back of the chair, preparing to move towards Wei Zhiren.

Li Yadai felt a chill run from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head, freezing in place.

The moment the door closed, Wei Zhiren let out a long sigh of relief.

Li Yadai slowly approached, clicking his tongue twice, just about to speak, when Wei Zhiren's phone rang, interrupting him.

Li Yadai: ”…“

I feel like the whole world is against me.

Wei Zhiren glanced at the caller ID, his eyes widening, ”Holy crap!“

Li Yadai asked with confusion,


Chapter 22:
”Mess with you? I wouldn't dare, Mr. Xu,“ Wei Zhiren tsked. ”I value my life, messing with you would make me ill.“

Xu Rongxuan snapped the phone shut.

Wei Zhiren stared at the phone, incredulous: ”He actually hung up on me!?“

Li Yadá also looked incredulous: ”You actually dared to mock Xu Rongxuan directly like that?“

Wei Zhiren slammed the table in anger, ”My brother has never hung up on me!“

Li Yadá: ”……“

I suspect you must have something wrong with your head.

”You're not afraid of Xu Rongxuan messing with you!“ Li Yadá grabbed Wei Zhiren's clothes, feeling that the brat was truly troublesome.

”What's there to be afraid of?“ Wei Zhiren smirked and pulled his clothes back, then said proudly, ”My brother is no pushover!“

Li Yadá: ”……You treat your brother like this?“

”Because my brother is awesome!“ Wei Zhiren said as if it were self-evident, ”A while ago, he even said that I hadn't caused him any trouble, and his spirit was much lighter.“

Here we need to reiterate Wei Zhiren's lifelong belief.

—Brothers are always right!

If a brother is wrong, refer to the previous statement.

Li Yadá: ”……“

I won't criticise Wei Xiaoming behind his back anymore.

I'll light him a row of candles.

Li Yadá felt that his opinion of Wei Zhiren had undergone countless revisions in just two days.

From ’Wow, my friend looks so认真 at work,‘ to ’Wow, my friend is so cunning and malicious,‘ and finally becoming ’Wow, my friend is indeed shameless despite being so mentally unstable.‘

Thinking about it made him feel warm.

Li Yadá's mind was racing as he glanced at the time; it was dinner time.

”I heard that the canteen in Weicheng is quite good.“

Upon hearing this, Wei Zhiren quickly handed his canteen card to Li Yadá.

He thought for a moment, ”By the way, bring me a few spicy dishes.“

Li Yadá took the card and paused, ”Why don't you come with me?“

Wei Zhiren looked at his grandson Li Yadá with a loving expression, ”Foolish child, because Xiao Cheng hasn't left yet.“

If the godly being wanted to take a look at the canteen, he would be stupid again.

Wei Zhiren refused to experience that foolish self again.

Li Yadá nodded and felt something was still off.

He puzzled, ”I remember you like sweet food.“

Wei Zhiren kicked the seat, ”Stop asking so many questions, scram.“

Li Yadá puzzled and scrambled away.

Leaving Wei Zhiren alone in the office to let his hair down.

Wei Zhiren slammed the table a few times, feeling his hand ache and tingle, then took a deep breath, finally suppressing the urge to scream.

Zhiren Zhiren: Ahahahahahahahahaha!

Zhiren Zhiren: [Crazy Dance.gif]

Zhiren Zhiren: Monkey Doctor! Monkey Doctor!

Zhiren Zhiren: Monkey Doctor! I'm about to give birth!

Zhiren Zhiren: Monkey Doctor! [Love.gif]

Zhiren Zhiren: [Crazy Call.gif]

Xiao Cheng and Liu Xiaomai had just entered the underground parking lot of the building where Weicheng was located.

Liu Xiaomai was still rambling on, ”In the future, the film and television department of Weicheng will be independent. After all, it's impossible for celebrities to frequently enter and exit such places. However, the independent office space is still under renovation, seemingly planning to be extravagant, so they temporarily rented an entire floor for the operation of film and television. But it's the same for you, you don't need to report here often…“

As Liu Xiaomai spoke and found the car, she knocked on the door to signal the driver to open it, then turned to look at Xiao Cheng and saw him lowering his head to flip through his phone. She reached out to cover the screen.

”Listen carefully!“

Xiao Cheng took the phone back and got into the car directly.

Liu Xiaomai rolled her eyes and sat on the passenger seat.

The signal in the underground parking lot was poor, but even the worst signal couldn't stop Wei Zhiren's crazy scrolling messages.

When the car left the parking lot and the phone signal resumed, Xiao Cheng glanced at WeChat and found that Wei Zhiren had sent over thirty messages.

Impressive, Mr. Wei.

Xiao Cheng opened the conversation window.

Little Black Monkey: The doctor is here.

Little Black Monkey: …Are you going to give birth?

Little Black Monkey: I calculated with my fingers, you probably don't have that function.

Zhiren Zhiren: Monkey Doctor, you're here! [I'm so scared, I'm pregnant.jpg]

Zhiren Zhiren: Monkey Doctor! Save me!

Little Black Monkey: I'm not a gynecologist.

Zhiren Zhiren: I'm carrying Xiao Cheng's child! [Hilarious]

Little Black Monkey: …

Xiao Cheng laughed in the car.

Little Black Monkey: I calculated with my fingers again, Xiao Cheng doesn't have such amazing ability either.

Zhiren Zhiren: My Cheng came to the company to see me today [Cute.jpg]

Zhiren Zhiren: He even invited me! [Super Shy.jpg]

Xiao Cheng tried to suppress his smile but failed after a long effort.

He endured Liu Xiaomai's death stare and coughed heavily.

Little Black Monkey: He wants to sleep with you?

Zhiren Zhiren: Your thoughts are too filthy, Monkey Doctor. [Blank Stare.jpg]

Zhiren Zhiren: Just a dinner invitation! But I refused =v=

Little Black Monkey: You actually let such a good opportunity slip away.

Zhiren Zhiren: No, please allow me to solemnly refuse.

Little Black Monkey: [Black Man Question.gif]

Zhiren Zhiren: Before I can control my expressions and behavior, I will absolutely not go out to dinner with my Cheng again!

Zhiren Zhiren: What if my Cheng invites me to eat crayfish? A meal will leave my hands and mouth oily, losing all my image.

Zhiren Zhiren: I refuse! Solemnly refuse!

Wei Zhiren just thought about that scene and found it too beautiful.

He really couldn't bear to look.

While Xiao Cheng wanted to knock open Wei Zhiren's head to see what was inside.

It was probably all water.

Little Black Monkey: …I think the possibility of crayfish is pretty small.

After all, he also had to consider the image of the perfect godly being in Wei Zhiren's heart!

Zhiren Zhiren: My Cheng is a fan of spicy food! The possibility of eating crayfish is super high!

Xiao Cheng: ”…“

Unable to refute.

Wei Zhiren sighed.

Zhiren Zhiren: You're too cruel, Monkey Doctor, why do you insist on making me explain?

Little Black Monkey: [Black Man Question.gif]

Zhiren Zhiren: Before I successfully transform from a fan of sweet food to spicy food, I won't go out to dinner with my Cheng!

Zhiren Zhiren: My Cheng is such a gentle and considerate person, he would definitely take into account my sweet food… just like last time!

Zhiren Zhiren: So I decided to cooperate with my Cheng and eat spicy food!

Zhiren Zhiren: Hahahaahaha.

Zhiren Zhiren: I'm almost enchanted by my selfless and handsome self.

Xiao Cheng looked at Wei Zhiren's messages for a while, then reached out and patted Liu Xiaomai's shoulder.

”Let's not have spicy skewers tonight, how about sweet and sour spare ribs?“

After saying this, the Emperor of Acting paused, then added.

”After dinner, we'll have cream puffs for dessert.“



He couldn't.

Because no matter how much Xiao Cheng ate, he maintained sufficient exercise— and he had the envy-inducing metabolism that prevented him from gaining weight.

The agent sighed, taking the Emperor of Acting to the usual restaurant and ordering a few sweet dishes, then resignedly buying two cream puffs.

Xiao Cheng had a very particular obsession with food; he would be abnormally obsessed with a certain dish for a period of time.

For example, when Liu Xiaomai had just dug Xiao Cheng out of the construction site, Xiao Cheng ate instant noodles for two whole months, and only the sweet and sour beef flavor, no matter how they persuaded him, he wouldn't eat anything else.

Or recently, Xiao Cheng particularly liked spicy skewers. Whenever he didn't have to rush to shoot scenes, he would run out of the film and television city to buy a bowl of spicy skewers.

Seeing Xiao Cheng finish the sweet and sour spare ribs and barely touch the braised pork, Liu Xiaomai knew that Xiao Cheng would probably focus on eating sweet and sour spare ribs for the next while.

”Why suddenly want to eat this?“ Liu Xiaomai opened the cream puffs box and asked.

Xiao Cheng reached out and moved the cream puffs, ”Mr. Wei likes.“

Liu Xiaomai: ”……“

No, big brother, you're not doing this right?

Mr. Wei doesn't seem that enthusiastic and determined towards you.


Chapter 23:
Liu Xiaomai simply could not discern any sign of affection towards Xiao Cheng in Wei Zhiren's cold and stern expression.

Xiao Cheng raised his eyes to look at his agent, slowly scooping cream into his mouth.

”I said, it's just that he's shy. You don't understand, so you haven't been able to catch up with Miss Qing yet.“

Liu Xiaomai: ”… You think you can catch up with Mr. Wei the same way?“

”I'm just a thin sheet of paper away from Mr. Wei, very…“ Xiao Cheng suddenly paused mid-sentence.

Eh?

Liu Xiaomai said he wanted to pursue Mr. Wei?

Emperor Xiao Shadow was momentarily dumbfounded, looking at his agent, ”I… want to pursue Mr. Wei?“

Liu Xiaomai was also stunned. He seemed to have realized something, and when he spoke again, his face was brimming with disbelief, his tone awkward: ”You… have quit smoking for him, asked Director Xu to vouch for him, changed your eating habits for him, invited him out to dinner twice on your own initiative, and you're not actually planning to pursue him?“

Xiao Cheng pondered for a moment, his eyes gradually brightening: ”You say it like… that, it seems to be true.“

Liu Xiaomai looked at Xiao Cheng, who seemed to have awakened some great power within himself, feeling utterly crushed.

Did I inadvertently push my artist out the door?!

Liu Xiaomai was filled with regret, almost wanting to yank his own head off and kick it like a ball.

Xiao Cheng looked at his agent's utterly defeated expression with a pleasant mood, thoughtfully placing a piece of crispy pork into his bowl.

Emperor Xiao Shadow calmly consoled his agent: ”Don't worry, I won't let Mr. Wei down.“

Liu Xiaomai slammed the table: ”I don't give a damn about your worry!“

He angrily chewed the piece of crispy pork.

”Don't shove things you don't like to eat into me!“

Xiao Cheng nodded, then calmly and composedly placed another piece of crispy pork onto Liu Xiaomai's plate.

Liu Xiaomai chewed the meat while looking at Xiao Cheng, his emotions complex.

Finally, the pig I raised has started to root for the cabbage…

It's just that the bunch of cabbage he's interested in is a bit too big, making him feel like he might not be able to root for it.

Old father Liu Xiaomai had also fretted over his brat Xiao Cheng to the point of exhaustion today.

…

Light and Shadow Media spent a hefty sum of money but could not suppress the malicious incident stirred up by the联动 of various major portals.

The act of assaulting an artist was too heinous in nature, involving a wide range and consistently remaining in the spotlight.

The internet was overwhelmingly condemning Xu Rongxuan's actions, questioning how someone like Xu Rongxuan, who had assaulted a famous artist, could still sit comfortably in the position of president.

Xu Rongxuan was so angry that he smashed things in the Light and Shadow headquarters, constantly exerting pressure on the public relations department and those portals, but it had little effect.

Xu Rongxuan's elders finally could no longer tolerate his arrogance and lack of restraint online, and took over his management.

Without Xu Rongxuan, Light and Shadow's public relations department swiftly released a statement.

The statement claimed that the incident was personal behavior by Xu Rongxuan, the company would not take responsibility, and promised to investigate the matter of Xu Rongxuan assaulting the artist, providing an account to the public. Xu Rongxuan had been suspended for investigation.

However, the criticism did not cease after the statement was released.

Fans could not tolerate their favorite actor being assaulted, and even dug up several actors who had once shot to fame like meteor showers but quickly faded, only to be assaulted by Xu Rongxuan.

This made one wonder if their rapid decline was due to offending Xu Rongxuan.

Subsequently, someone exposed that Light and Shadow was essentially Xu Rongxuan's personal fiefdom, and Xu Rongxuan had even boldly declared in front of many people that Light and Shadow Media was his private garden.

Fans could no longer control their emotions, furiously condemning Light and Shadow on various portals, and some even went to the gates of Light and Shadow headquarters to sit in protest.

Light and Shadow's statement failed to calm the public.

Countless people commented under the official website and various portals that Xu Rongxuan should be severely punished; his actions had harmed them, which was a crime!

The day after the incident was exposed, Light and Shadow released another statement, saying that Xu Rongxuan had been detained and was awaiting investigation.

This time, the anger of the fans was finally somewhat quelled.

That morning, Liu Xiaomai rushed to B City Film City.

Xiao Cheng's shooting was wrapping up today, and he planned to come pick him up.

Xiao Cheng had just finished his makeup and was browsing Weibo.

His Weibo comments were in chaos, with many of his own and others’ fans surging to his page because of Director Xu's tweet, hoping he would reveal the truth.

Liu Xiaomai glanced at Xiao Cheng's screen.

”What? Light and Shadow contacted you?“

Xiao Cheng nodded, ”Mr. Xu from the administrative department contacted me, hoping I could help clarify the situation.“

”Clarify?“ Liu Xiaomai looked incredulous, ”What face does he have to ask you to clarify? Every word Director Xu said was the truth!“

Xiao Cheng arched an eyebrow, ”Exactly, so I'm temporarily pretending I don't know.“

He then took a selfie and posted it on Weibo, this time without using Meitu Xiuxiu.

Xiao Cheng: Thank you all for your concern! My new show is finished~ [Love You] [Image]

The comments quickly flooded in after the post was made.

Emperor Xiao Shadow scrolled through the comments and summarized: Handsome, don't cultivate! Focus on the outside world! Did you get hurt? We're so worried for you QAQ Xiao Cheng casually replied to a familiar ID with an ambiguous [Smile].

This expression was versatile; normally, it was just a smile, but recently it was more often used for ridicule.

Liu Xiaomai clicked his tongue: ”What are you planning?“

Xiao Cheng stood up from the chair, ”Of course, to have Light and Shadow proactively announce that my contract will expire and I will be leaving. If I announce it myself, it might seem like I'm kicking someone when they're down.“

Just as he finished speaking, Xiao Cheng's phone rang.

The caller was Xu Rongxuan's uncle, who had been helping clean up Xu Rongxuan's mess, another Mr. Xu from the administrative department.

Xiao Cheng clearly communicated his intention not to renew the contract and requested that Light and Shadow proactively release the news.

After hanging up, he handed the matter over to Liu Xiaomai, instructing him to go with the people from Weicheng to negotiate with Light and Shadow.

This negotiation took three days.

Three days later, Light and Shadow's official website and various microblogs released a press release.

[Official Announcement from Light and Shadow Media]

The contract between our artist Xiao Cheng and the company will expire in fifteen days (xxxx year x month x day). After consultation, Xiao Cheng has no intention of renewing with the company and will leave in fifteen days.

Announcement.

xxxx year x month x day

Light and Shadow Media Administrative Department

Xiao Cheng then reposted the Weibo.

Xiao Cheng: Goodbye and good luck [Smile]

Wei Zhiren saw this when he first opened Weibo.

He pushed up his glasses, extremely pleased.

Fifteen days left!

Wei Zhiren counted on his fingers, fifteen days until Xiao Cheng was his!

Thinking about it was so exhilarating!

Wei Zhiren happily counted the days,顺便 liking Xiao Cheng's Weibo post.

However, just as he liked it and refreshed, Xu Rongxuan, whom he


Chapter 24:
Zi Zhenzhen: In reply to @Xu Rongxuan: You're not sick, are you? I even have a copy of your medical records, but with your mouth full of filth and your stench unbearable, it looks like you're not just mentally ill, but your anus has grown onto your head, hasn't it?

Xu Rongxuan: In reply to @Zi Zhenzhen: Just keep your mouth shut, Wei Zhenzhen [Doraemon smiling], I just love your look of disapproval mixed with helplessness towards me.

Wei Zhenzhen angrily slammed his keyboard!

You can do it, Xu Rongxuan!

Zi Zhenzhen: In reply to @Xu Rongxuan: I can't kill you? [Smiling] Then let me inform you that you and your company are about to receive a legal letter from the Lanxin Group.

Zi Zhenzhen: In reply to @Xu Rongxuan: Wei Rongxuan, I'm telling you right here and now, I'm going to target you! No one can stop me, so just wait for it!



Not long after, Wei Zhenzhen's Weibo verification changed to Lanxin Group Director, shocking many of his followers.

Who would have thought that my Cheng would be such a high-profile fan?

Xiao Cheng's fans were as magical as ever; they knew Wei Zhenzhen was rich, but their understanding of being rich was quite broad.

However, a real director of a Fortune 500 company truly stunned a number of people.

Xiao Cheng sat by the director, holding his phone, completely baffled by how things had turned out this way.

He was now looking at Wei Zhenzhen's mask being mercilessly torn apart by Xu Rongxuan, feeling helpless.

… What should I do.

Although he knew from the start that Zi Zhenzhen was indeed Wei Zhenzhen, Wei Zhenzhen himself was unaware of this.

How should he face Wei Zong, whose cold persona had been shattered?

Xiao Cheng couldn't help but fall into deep thought.

He hesitated for a moment before opening WeChat, deciding to take the initiative.

Xiao Cheng: Wei Zong, is this you? [Weibo screenshot]

Wei Zhenzhen, sitting beside his brother, exploded in anger.

He fiercely condemned Xu Rongxuan's arrogance and expressed his immense dissatisfaction with Xu Rongxuan's lack of adherence to rules.

What methods one uses secretly to manipulate things and whether one gains or loses from it are all matters of capability.

But Xu Rongxuan's direct approach of tearing off the mask was destroying the shared sense of rules in this circle.

Didn't Xiao Cheng still consider the face of Jingyuan even as he was about to leave, without directly abandoning Jingyuan to issue his own announcements?

Some things could only be done in secret; bringing them to the surface was inappropriate.

”Xu Rongxuan is incompetent and has a hole in his head! When he loses, he tears off the mask, how can such an idiot be right!“

Wei Zhenzhen felt his pent-up anger exploding inside him.

”He's foolish and has countless dark secrets, easily uncovered, it's his fault? What right does he have to drag Xiao Cheng into it!“

Wei Ziming, looking at his angry younger brother, pinched his nose and stared at the Weibo Wei Zhenzhen had posted.

He wasn't even concerned about his brother's name being exposed by Xu Rongxuan.

What did it matter?

Wei Zhenzhen had nothing to hide.

… Except for his fantasies about Xiao Cheng.

He pinched his brother's face, saw the WeChat notification, and stuffed the phone back into Wei Zhenzhen's arms, ”Xiao Cheng is looking for you.“

The angry Wei Zhenzhen, who had puffed himself up like a ball, deflated like a punctured balloon.

He puffed his cheeks open, opened WeChat, and was struck by lightning when he saw Xiao Cheng's screenshot.

”.…“

F*ck!

Wei Zhenzhen's mind crashed.

Go to hell, you f*cking Xu Rongxuan!

You tore off my mask!

No, losing the mask wasn't the big deal, the big deal was that my persona was shattered!

What should I do!?

Wei Zhenzhen, with a twisted expression, looked at Xiao Cheng's messages, unable to think of how to reply for a long time.

Xiao Cheng waited for a long time without a reply, knowing that Wei Zhenzhen was probably stunned.

He thought for a moment, carefully choosing his words, and slowly tapped on the screen.

Xiao Cheng: Actually, I've known for a long time [smiling].

Xiao Cheng: When I had dinner with your mother, she mentioned your name, and later when you apologized to me on Weibo, I knew it was you.

Xiao Cheng: I'm very grateful for your liking me all these years, I hope you won't mind my keeping it a secret.

Xiao Cheng: You seem very angry about the Weibo incident, don't damage your health over someone like Xu Rongxuan [head rubbing].

Wei Zhenzhen held the phone, looking at the messages, pulling his brother's arm in a mix of wanting to cry and laugh.

Wei Ziming looked at his brother with worry, feeling that his brother was about to go insane.

”Uuuuuu My god, why is he so good QAQ!“ Wei Zhenzhen hugged his brother's arm, unable to speak, only moaning, ”He's so good!“

Wei Ziming had a headache.

He comforted his brother, who was bawling, and had the secretary bring up two mango puddings.

After the puddings were brought up, Wei Zhenzhen let go of his brother's arm, biting his spoon while looking at WeChat, mumbling indistinctly.

Wei Ziming carefully recognized and found that his brother was mumbling things like ”Xiao Cheng is so cute“ ”My Cheng is a universe-level warmhearted man“ and so on.

Little Ming, the life winner, thought that little Zhen, the infatuated man, was beyond saving.

The big brother of the infatuated man sighed, ”So you came to me, what do you want to do?“

”Find me to clean my butt,“ Wei Zhenzhen tapped on the comments where he and Xu Rongxuan had been exchanging insults on Weibo, with a face full of entreaty, ”My dear brother is the best!“

Wei Ziming really wanted to beat his brother up, ”You only call me brother at times like this.“

”Who said that!“ Wei Zhenzhen ate the last bit of pudding, standing his ground, ”I also call you when I'm short of money!“

Wei Ziming: ”…“

I'm going to find an opportunity to beat you up.

He really won't know how to speak properly without a beating.

”Find the legal department yourself,“ Wei Ziming started to shoo him away, ”You're just a nominal director, it's time to make your presence felt.“

”No, I can't, my spirit has been severely traumatized, I'm not fit for work,“ Wei Zhenzhen played the fool.

Although he had been unusually high-profile once, he definitely didn't want any deep involvement with the massive Lanxin.

Wei Zhenzhen just wanted to capitalize on the situation.

After all, he always believed in the principle of ”not taking advantage of a bargain is a bastard, not using a backdoor is a fool,“ and he had walked his brother's backdoor effortlessly all these years.

Wei Ziming really pampered his little brother.

Seeing Wei Zhenzhen run to the sofa, he sighed and called the head of the legal department to come to his office.

Wei Zhenzhen happily swayed his tail, holding the phone and hugging it on the sofa, looking at the few messages on WeChat.

He happily admired them many times and was about to reply to Xiao Cheng when the impatient Xiao Yindi, who hadn't received a reply for a long time, put on the Little Black Monkey mask to find him.

Little Black Monkey: [Weibo screenshot] Lanxin Group Director?

Little Black Monkey: Aren't you the president of Weicheng?

Wei Zhenzhen glanced at WeChat and finally decided to reply the familiar friend first.

Zi Zhenzhen: It's nominal =v=, my brother is in charge.

Xiao Cheng, seeing the reply from the mask almost immediately, felt an inexplicable sense of jealousy rising in his heart.

Little Black Monkey: An interview with the fallen director, what are your thoughts?

Zi Zhenzhen: Xiao Cheng doesn't mind me falling [Cute eating hand.jpg]

Zi Zhenzhen: My Cheng even sent me a message to comfort me, suddenly Xu Rongxuan is nothing [>v<] Zi Zhenzhen: You say my Cheng is so good to me, does he like me?

Zi Zhenzhen: Oh my, I don't know how to reply [Super shy.jpg]

Wei Zhenzhen said this and exited WeChat, scrolling through Xiao Cheng's WeChat messages.

Then he opened the input box and sent an ellipsis.

Xiao Cheng: ”…“

Xiao Yindi looked at the six dots Wei Zhenzhen sent to him on WeChat, then at the long string of messages Wei Zhenzhen sent to Little Black Monkey, feeling a bit heartache.

He sighed lightly and switched back to Little Black Monkey's window.

Little Black Monkey: Then what, what are you going to do?

Zi Zhenzhen: He dares to provoke me, I have no reason to be a coward? [Worried eating hand.jpg]

Zi Zhenzhen: I've issued a challenge, if he's not destroyed, it's because my brother's love for me isn't deep enough!

Little Black Monkey: …

Zi Zhenzhen: Brother Ming's forty-meter saber is already thirsting for action!

Chapter 22



Xiao Cheng looked at the message Wei Zhiren sent and lit a row of candles for Wei Ziming.



For some reason, he felt a bit sorry for his big brother who was always being made to do the hard work by Wei Zhiren.



After Xiao Cheng sent six points to Wei Zhiren disguised as a baby monkey and put away his phone,



He was at the wrap part

y for his recent film. The director was sitting next to Xiao Cheng, holding a bottle of wine and burping.



Seeing Xiao Cheng put away his phone, he tsked, ”Young people should play less with their phones. You'll have to wear glasses when you're still young, you'll see about that.“



Xiao Cheng, who had heard Director Xu's words so many times that his ears were almost calloused, nodded in response and ate his food in silence.



There were not only members of the production team at the table, but also quite a few people from neighboring production teams who had come to蹭 food after hearing about the wrap party.



—Of course, those who came to eat were either friends of Xiao Cheng or friends of Director Xu.



Xiao Cheng, who had been in the news lately, was protected by his friends as if they were protecting their own child at this table. Anyone who tried to approach Xiao Cheng was met with a loving gaze from the table of actors, actresses, directors, and production staff.



As a result, Xiao Cheng's last meal in B City Film City was unusually peaceful.



After the meal, the director was drunk with the fumes of alcohol. He was supported by the production staff, pulling Xiao Cheng by one hand, slurring his words, ”Don't forget the press conference in two days!“



Xiao Cheng, who never touched alcohol, nodded clearly and pulled his sleeve back, ”Mm.“



Director Xu felt that not drinking was too much, and seeing Liu Xiaomai appear, he let go of Xiao Cheng, ”Until tomorrow!“



Xiao Cheng, the Emperor of Acting, immediately laughed, waving his sleeves and bowing, ”Yes!“



Director Xu instantly became a master of acting as well, straightening his body and standing tall, putting on an imperial demeanor, one hand on the production staff's head, swaying drunkly, ”Come back to work the day after tomorrow!“



Xiao Cheng, seeing the production staff who looked like they wanted to beat up the director, coughed and pulled Liu Xiaomai away with a swift retreat.



….



Two days later, the press conference venue was crowded with people.



Countless reporters pushed and shoved to get into the venue, eager to get the first scoop on Xiao Cheng.



If one were to ask what the biggest news in the entertainment industry was right now?



Of course, it was the series of scandals that had been uncovered by the He Wenle incident, revealing the dark side of Light and Shadow Media, and Xiao Cheng's status as an iron-fanatic and wealthy fan!



Come on, a member of the board of Blue Star Group!



Such a certification was not something that could be changed at will. It was most likely true, right?



A member of the board of Blue Star Group, Xiao Cheng's long-time fan, had been instantly ignited by a single sentence from the president of Light and Shadow Media, Xu Rongxuan. He suddenly changed from his extremely aloof image and without hesitation personally stepped in to defend Xiao Cheng, even showing a willingness to take down Xu Rongxuan and Light and Shadow Media!



There was so much material to dig into here!



This was the first press conference Xiao Cheng formally held after the incident. Countless reporters were itching to make a big scoop.



Xiao Cheng and Director Xu sat in the backstage area, listening to the commotion in front, calmly sitting together, playing Dou Di Zhu on their phones.



The two of them were playing together, and in just two hours, they had already swindled a lot of fun coins from others.



Director Xu was very confident in Xiao Cheng.



In fact, even if Xiao Cheng did make a big scoop, he did not mind.



Because Xiao Cheng almost never went through a proper press conference, and it was difficult for reporters to get any information unrelated to his works from him.



Xiao Cheng was also very calm. What kind of scenes hadn't he seen over the years?



Rather than being as nervous as Liu Xiaomai, who was taking antacid pills, he might as well play more rounds of Dou Di Zhu and have some fun.



Liu Xiaomai, who had just taken antacid pills, looked at the two heads leaning together and heard the sound effects from their phones, feeling like she was going to go mad.



”Only twenty minutes until it starts! You guys need to go on stage!“ the manager shouted angrily.



Director Xu hurriedly snatched his phone back, ”Hey, don't take my phone! It's my last round!“



Xiao Cheng turned around calmly to dodge Liu Xiaomai's attack, slowly tapping the screen, ”Royal Flush, I won.“



Director Xu looked at the gold coins on his phone and enthusiastically cheered for Xiao Cheng, the Emperor of Acting, very happy.



Liu Xiaomai felt her stomach hurt even more.



Xiao Cheng put away his phone and thoughtfully poured a cup of hot water for Liu Xiaomai.



Liu Xiaomai rolled her eyes dramatically, ”Get lost!“



Xiao Cheng, the Emperor of Acting, quickly followed Director Xu to ”get lost“ as well.



The venue was already filled with reporters.



The moment Xiao Cheng and Director Xu appeared, the flashes went off like lightning, the brightness of the venue increasing by several degrees.



Xiao Cheng squinted his eyes, feeling that when he was full of big news in the future, he should wear sunglasses to press conferences.



His eyes were almost blinded by the flashes.



Director Xu looked at the time, and after everyone who was supposed to come had arrived, he raised his hand in a downward motion. When the venue gradually calmed down, he looked at the host to signal him to speak.



Since this was a press conference for a film production, it was usually necessary to introduce the work first.



So even if those reporters were eager to make a big scoop, they had to temporarily hold back, listen to and watch the introduction, and take notes seriously.



But after the initial calm, when it was time for free questions, the entire venue suddenly exploded.



The host held the microphone, glancing at the serious media people sitting in the front row, and pointed to one of them to speak.



Xiao Cheng was still thinking about what dessert would go well with sweet and sour spare ribs tonight when he was suddenly called out by that reporter.



”Teacher Xiao, I would like to ask, after you terminated your contract with Light and Shadow Media, have you decided on your next cooperation company? Do you have any direction?“



Xiao Cheng, the Emperor of Acting, stared at that reporter for a while, thinking that the reporter's question was relatively mild.



However, he still wanted to make a big scoop and get all the reporters to shut up.



So Xiao Cheng, the Emperor of Acting, twisted the microphone stand on the table, leaning in a bit and said, ”Why doesn't anyone think that I actually don't want to continue as an actor?“



The entire venue suddenly fell silent, the reporters staring at Xiao Cheng on stage in shock, their minds momentarily blank.



Xiao Cheng slowly continued to drop bombs, ”I suddenly feel that living in the countryside and farming is pretty good. Being a farmer facing the earth, rising with the sun and setting with the moon, going up mountains and down rivers, strengthening my body, and producing valuable grains.“



Reporter: ”……“



Meow meow meow meow meow?



Xiao Cheng, the Emperor of Acting, looked at the bewildered reporter and sighed, ”Just kidding, just to liven up the atmosphere.“



Xiao Cheng, who was teasing the reporters, looked calm and composed, as if the reporters couldn't even take a joke.



Reporter: ”……“



Damn, this guy is so deserving of a beating.



Xiao Cheng lightly tapped the table, ”Please note your next statements; questions unrelated to this production will not be answered.“



…


Wei Zhiren couldn't watch the live stream of this press conference because he was negotiating with the legal department of Blue Star Group on how to send a lawyer's letter to Xu Rongxuan.



They compiled the current evidence and events, ultimately determining slander and intentional injury as the main issues. After writing the two lawyer's letters, they sent them to Light and Shadow Media under the supervision of a notary.



As soon as they were sent, Wei Zhiren angrily opened his Weibo.



In the past two days, because he had been negotiating with the legal department, his Weibo had been quiet, which directly turned his Weibo comments into a carnival ground for the most active haters.



A group of haters mocked Wei Zhiren for making a big fuss but not following through, saying he talked about sending a lawyer's letter but hadn't done anything for days, and even sarcastically said things like Blue Star Group members were nothing special.



The more Wei Zhiren read, the angrier he got. He impulsively posted the scanned copy of the non-confidential lawyer's letter on Weibo.



He adopted an extremely aloof attitude.



Zi Zhenzhen: @Xu Rongxuan [Doraemon smile][Image]



Chapter 23



The fans who had been suppressed for two days suddenly breathed a sigh of relief.



Wei Ziming rarely paid attention to such matters. After confirming that his incompetent younger brother was getting along well with the legal depart

ment, he simply let it go.



No one had expected Wei Zhiren to be serious.



Those within Wei Zhiren's circle knew that while they might talk a big game and have internal conflicts, in the end, they would still reconcile when the time came.



This style of directly taking someone to court was extremely rare in the industry.


Chapter 26:
Indeed, one should not push matters to an extreme; harmony brings wealth, and this is always the principle merchants adhere to.

”Actually, it's not as bad as you think,“ said Xu Rongxuan's uncle to Xu Rongxuan, whose face was filled with anger. ”Wei Zizhen did not directly accuse you but sent a legal letter to give you time to prove that he was not prepared to sever your path directly.“

Xu Rongxuan held the cup in his hand, paying no heed to his uncle's words at all.

The elderly patriarch, who had fretted over the younger generation, looked at this arrogant and domineering young man for a long time before finally speaking: ”If you could publicly apologize…“

Xu Rongxuan seemed as if he had touched a forbidden area, and the cup he held slammed heavily onto the ground: ”Don't even think about it!“

The elder did not speak further.

He sighed and decided to seek help on his own.

…

Xiao Cheng came down from the podium after the press conference and returned to the backstage, feeling his eyes blinded by the flashes of the cameras for a long time.

Indeed, he should wear sunglasses the next time he was surrounded by the media, he thought to himself.

Liu Xiaomai still held the cup of hot water that Xiao Cheng had poured before leaving, drinking half of it; the rest had already grown cold.

The press conference ended successfully, and the reporters, as usual, failed to dig any information out of Xiao Cheng, even when they almost poked him in the back to question him. Xiao Cheng's calm and composed demeanor never wavered.

The manager drank the remaining water in the cup, sighed deeply, and released a long sigh.

Liu Xiaomai said, ”You'll have some free time until your contract ends, but it's still advisable for you to stay at home to avoid the publicity.“

Xiao Cheng thought for a moment and nodded.

His current situation indeed did not suit going around town.

Xiao Yǐngdì glanced at Xu Dao, who smiled and entered the backstage, seemingly recalling something and then turned to Liu Xiaomai and said, ”Xu Dao said he has a new film and plans to directly negotiate with Weicheng. Have you received the notification?“

Liu Xiaomai was already employed at Weicheng.

He paused when he heard this, ”No, I've been busy with other things these past two days.“

Xiao Cheng raised an eyebrow.

Liu Xiaomai sighed, ”When I was at Guangying, I still had a few young men under me. They said they wouldn't go with me before, but with Guangying in turmoil these past two days, they've been contacting me again.“

Xiao Cheng shook his head, ”Weicheng doesn't necessarily have to accept.“

”Weicheng is almost putting all its resources on you. I do indeed want to take advantage of this opportunity to promote a few more people with your resources,“ Liu Xiaomai said frankly. ”Actually, if you speak up, Manager Wei might just accept.“

Xiao Cheng remained silent. He took out his phone and flipped through his Weibo posts.

”Let's wait a bit longer. After the situation with Guangying and Weicheng is resolved, there will be a group of people clamoring to enter Weicheng.“

Xiao Cheng opened the legal letter Wei Zizhen had posted on Weibo and handed it to Liu Xiaomai.

”The few under you before are not of the right caliber,“ Xiao Yǐngdì paused, ”I can't betray Manager Wei.“

Liu Xiaomai read the legal letter and then looked at Xiao Cheng.

”You haven't even caught up to them yet, and you're already thinking about them.“

Xiao Cheng took back his phone, pulled out two pieces of sugar to quit smoking from his pocket, and mumbled, ”I'm preparing in advance.“

He said, ”I need to handle all these miscellaneous matters properly to pursue them with the most perfect posture.“

Liu Xiaomai rolled his eyes, ”You're clearly scared.“

Xiao Yǐngdì looked at his manager, ”You don't understand, so you can't catch up to Qingjie.“

Liu Xiaomai decided to take Xiao Cheng out for sweet and sour pork tonight.

…

Wei Zizhen turned off his phone for three days, stayed at his childhood friend's house for three days, and disappeared from everyone's sight for three days.

He was pressuring Xu Rongxuan's family.

Just as his uncle had said, the reason he sent a legal letter to Xu Rongxuan was indeed to give Xu Rongxuan a last chance.

If he had directly taken drastic measures and sued, not only would Xu Rongxuan's family explode instantly, but Wei Zizhen himself would be beaten up by his father and brother.

First, he warned; if that didn't work, he sent a legal letter; if that didn't work, he would sue.

This was the default procedure in the business world—of course, if he was determined to utterly destroy an opponent, a swift and direct attack would be more appropriate.

But Wei Zizhen could not let his fight with Xu Rongxuan cause a total breakdown between the two families.

What was it called?

Oh right, it was called warning before resorting to force.

Wei Zizhen believed he had given Xu Rongxuan enough face.

As long as there was a level-headed person in Xu Rongxuan's family, they should think of a way to make Xu Rongxuan apologize in public.

As long as Xu Rongxuan apologized, it meant Wei Zizhen had won; the slander against Xiao Cheng would be nullified, and Wei Zizhen would tacitly withdraw the almost-ready lawsuit documents.

Unfortunately, three days passed, and Wei Zizhen still did not see Xu Rongxuan's apology.

Not only did he not see it, he also learned from his childhood friends that Xu Rongxuan had been all over town these past few days.

”He can do it,“ Wei Zizhen sat in front of the computer desk, holding a pillow from his childhood friend's house, watching the previous broadcast of Xiao Cheng's press conference while slowly turning on his phone.

Unlike Xu Rongxuan's attitude of being ”the best in the world,“ the reinforcements brought by Xu Rongxuan's uncle—his own father—had visited twice in these three days.

He first went directly to Wei's father, hoping that Wei's father would ask his young relatives to back off, as this was not something children should be causing a fuss over.

However, Wei's father found it extremely difficult.

He said that it was improper for the elders to interfere in the conflicts between the young generation.

Unable to convince Wei's father, Xu Rongxuan's old father could only settle for a secondary option and seek out Wei's mother.

However, Wei's mother was in tune with Wei's father, calmly changing the subject and avoiding Wei Zizhen's matter.

Finally, when Xu Rongxuan's old father visited for the second time, he encountered Wei Ziming.

Wei Ziming also shrugged, saying that he needed to find Xiao Zhen; if he couldn't control him, he couldn't control Xu Rongxuan either, right?

The attitude of the Wei family infuriated Xu Rongxuan's old father, yet he could not reach Wei Zizhen at all.

Xu Rongxuan's old father sighed, hopelessly dialing Wei Zizhen's phone again.

This time, it was finally connected.

A gentle smile spread across Xu's father's face, and his tone was very calm: ”Little Wei, I finally found you.“

Wei Zizhen laughed and lied brazenly: ”Sorry, Uncle Xu, I went camping with friends these past two days and there was no signal on my phone. I heard you were looking for me?“

”You were looking for me,“ Xu's father held the phone in silence for a moment, ”Little Wei, look at what happened with our Rongxuan…?“

”Xu Rongxuan?“ Wei Zizhen lightly tapped the table, ”Uncle Xu, you saw it too, I sent a legal letter, not an ultimatum, right?“

”But look, you've already asked our entire family to intervene, and even came to me personally, but he still hasn't shown any sign of apologizing. I'm very unhappy about it.“

Wei Zizhen paused the video of Xiao Cheng's press conference and then said, ”My demands aren't high; the legal letter was clear. He needs to apologize publicly and clear his name of the slander against Xiao Cheng.“

Xu's father pursed his lips, ”How about, Little Wei, you let Rongxuan apologize to you privately? This boy is very proud and would find it too difficult to apologize in public.“

Wei Zizhen didn't like what he heard.

Who wasn't proud?

”Uncle Xu, if Xu Rongxuan doesn't apologize in public, I'm also in a difficult position.“

”I'm very proud too,“ Wei Zizhen said, emphasizing that he was the universe's first and foremost little pride, ”This was all Xu Rongxuan's fault for not following the rules and breaking them. Why should I be the one to suffer? Right?“

”I'll be direct— I want to see his apology announcement in public. I don't care what means you use, whether he apologizes in person or someone else does it on his behalf, but I want to see sincerity.“

Xu's father still tried to appeal to Wei Zizhen's emotions, playing the role of the father who fretted over his children, almost on the verge of tears.

However, the universe's first and foremost little pride, Wei Zizhen, refused the long-standing broth cooked by Xu Rongxuan's father.

Because he also had a father who fretted over him, who smiled and said, ”We've even brought out the nuclear option, Blue Star. If you don't wrap this up nicely, be careful of your butt.“

Thinking about it was truly terrifying.

Wei Zizhen, thinking of his own safety, sighed deeply.

What could he do?

He was also very desperate.

”Uncle Xu, if I don't see Xu Rongxuan's sincerity after the legal letter's deadline, we'll see each other in court.“


Chapter 27:
The Author Has Something to Say:
Xiao Cheng: Felt loved:)

Wei Zhiren: What a coincidence, I felt loved too:)[While patting his bottom.]



Chapter 24

Apart from Xiao Cheng, Wei Zhiren was actually a person who tended to talk nonsense.

For example, since the age of ten, he had used his soft, childish voice to tell his older brother that he would accompany him for a morning run, only to have his older brother shiver in the cold wind for half an hour the next day, without ever seeing the promised younger brother.

This lie had lasted from age ten until now. Every time Wei Ziming proposed going for a morning run, Wei Zhiren would readily agree but never managed to break free from the chains of his bed.

However, whenever Xiao Cheng was involved, Wei Zhiren seemed to have a switch flipped inside him, becoming extremely serious about everything.

The day after receiving a call from Mr. Xu, Wei Zhiren rushed to work.

The Film Department of Weicheng had already received numerous resumes and some probing from experienced elders in the industry. Wei Ziming had found the people useful, accepting all the probing and filtering through many resumes, leaving only a few for Wei Zhiren to review.

When Wei Zhiren arrived at the company, the heads of various depart

ments surged forward, aggressively surrounding the bewildered Wei Zhiren and leading him into the meeting room.

For the first time, Wei Zhiren truly felt the complexity of the matters his elder brother had to face daily.

President Wei listened to the work reports with a headache, still unable to shake off his lethargic state.

Assistant Wang noticed President Wei's distraction and had to painstakingly add detailed supplements while taking the meeting notes.

—This is still a small company with only two main businesses!

Wei Zhiren endured the morning meeting in a daze, feeling dizzy and brain-fagged, but managed to catch a few things.

For example, many of the artists from Light and Shadow had started privately contacting Weicheng, and several people whose careers Xu Rongxuan had destroyed were seeking him out to testify against Light and Shadow in court.

Another example was that the Human Resources Department had received many resumes, a few of which were promising enough to consider for the first batch of new hires.

Moreover, the Film Department strongly demanded to be separated from the office building, needing training rooms, recording studios, and dance rooms!

After everyone left the meeting room, President Weicheng, who was still in his lethargic state, turned to look at Assistant Wang, who was exhausted from taking notes.

Assistant Wang paused for a moment: ”I will print the meeting notes and deliver them to you, Mr. Wei.“

Wei Zhiren nodded, rubbed his temples, and walked out unsteadily.

Back in his office, Wei Zhiren felt as though the sun looked green after the constant meetings throughout the morning.

…In the future, I must be kinder to my brother, he thought.

President Weicheng, still in his lethargic state, waved his hands, reviewed the documents, stamped them, and even had lunch delivered by Assistant Wang.

When Wei Zhiren lifted his head from the pile of documents, the office lights had somehow turned on.

Wei Zhiren stretched his sore neck and shoulders from sitting for a long time, then turned to open the chat window of his companion.

Little Black Monkey: I heard that many people from Light and Shadow have been contacting you recently?

Little Black Monkey: Some people from Light and Shadow have poor character; be careful.

Little Black Monkey: ? Where is he?

Wei Zhiren pressed his neck, winced in pain, and used his seldom-used One-Finger Zen technique, tapping the keyboard with each strike.

Zhiren Zhiren: Okay, okay, I know, mysterious Mr. Monkey who won't reveal his name!

Zhiren Zhiren: I've been too busy with work for three days; I've been so busy that the sun seems green when I look at it.

Xiao Cheng, who had rested at home for a whole day, saw the reply and immediately messaged back.

Little Black Monkey: Young man, I've told you before, maintain a healthy schedule and don't overwork.

Zhiren Zhiren: …Monkey, you've changed. You weren't like this before; you used to love me.[Crying in distress.jpg]

Little Black Monkey: I'll reluctantly give you a paw rub[Catfish eyes.jpg]

Zhiren Zhiren: Rub my neck[Flipping over.jpg]

Wei Zhiren switched hands to press the other side of his neck, continuing with his One-Finger Zen.

Zhiren Zhiren: Monkey, I'm telling you, Xu Rongxuan is a textbook Second Son.

Zhiren Zhiren: He has every trait of a villain that a novel would have, not a single one missing![Laughing awkwardly]

Xiao Cheng paused when he saw these messages.

Little Black Monkey: Actually, your behavior is quite like that of a cannon fodder in a novel.

Wei Zhiren was not happy with this.

Zhiren Zhiren: Nonsense, look at my background and how favored I am. I'm clearly the protagonist—turning clouds into rain, stirring up storms, making the entire country tremble with a single move![Laughing awkwardly]

Little Black Monkey: …

Little Black Monkey: Who is heaven and earth?[Laughing awkwardly]

Zhiren Zhiren: …

Wei Zhiren was shocked; his companion was not like this before!

Zhiren Zhiren: You, you rascal monkey, I really misjudged you.

Xiao Cheng was silent for a moment, realizing that he might have ruined his character.

He thought for a while and decided to pretend nothing had happened, steering the conversation back to the topic.

Little Black Monkey: [Well-behaved.jpg] What has Xu Rongxuan done to you? I haven't seen any activity from him these days.

Wei Zhiren didn't pay much attention to his companion's character change and complained unhappily.

Zhiren Zhiren: It's said that he's been partying all over lately, completely ignoring me. His father even came to my place to plead for him…tsk tsk, to be honest, I feel a bit sorry for his father.

Zhiren Zhiren: His father still believes Xu Rongxuan is an innocent child and told me that he is proud and arrogant, suggesting we resolve it privately!

Zhiren Zhiren: Do you know how I looked back then→[Wide-eyed.jpg]

Zhiren Zhiren: Zhiren Baby is also a proud and arrogant little prince. Zhiren Baby is going to cause trouble![Laughing awkwardly]

Despite his companion's words, Xiao Cheng wasn't surprised.

In fact, Xu Rongxuan's personality, with his unstable mental condition yet managing to sit at the top of Light and Shadow, was largely due to his father's indulgence.

That was the most criticized series of statements: ”He's still just a child.“

Xiao Cheng wasn't sure if Wei Zhiren's talk of causing trouble was just talk or if he truly intended to do something, but with the people backing Wei Zhiren, he likely wouldn't suffer—after all, even Xu Rongxuan's father had to humble himself to seek a private resolution with Wei Zhiren.

And he had been sternly rejected.

Emperor Xiao Shadow felt quite pleased.

Little Black Monkey: Alright, alright, cause trouble, cause trouble, you'll be happy:)

After saying that, Emperor Xiao Shadow paused for a moment and asked again.

Little Black Monkey: After Xiao Cheng finishes filming, he'll have more free time. Don't you think you should take some action?

Wei Zhiren paused when he saw this message.

Zhiren Zhiren: Question mark question mark question mark

Zhiren Zhiren: What action? After eating spicy food, my face swells up like a sausage. What kind of action can I do?[Desperate eyes.jpg]

Zhiren Zhiren: [Crying in distress.jpg]

Little Black Monkey: …

Xiao Cheng, seeing Wei Zhiren's message, thought it was better to go to Weicheng himself.

Little Black Monkey: Then go to work obediently:)

Zhiren Zhiren: I would anyway, it's the kingdom I built for Cheng!

Though he said that, the next day, fully armed with two boxes of cream puffs, Xiao Cheng went to Weicheng but was told that Wei Zhiren was not in the company.

Wei Zhiren had gone to Blue Star.

Because Xu Rongxuan had updated his Weibo, and it was a video.

The content was an apology, but Xu Rongxuan's attitude was arrogant. He read from a script in a sarcastic tone, and everyone could see that he didn't care about the matter and had no genuine remorse.

Although Xu Rongxuan's apology video confirmed that his slander about Xiao Cheng finding a patron was a lie, Wei Zhiren was still very angry.

He absolutely refused to acknowledge any sincerity in Xu Rongxuan's apology video!

Wei Ziming signed the documents, glanced at his indignant younger brother, and said, ”You've already achieved your goal of clearing Xiao Cheng's name; there's no need to personally confront the Xu family over this.“

Wei Zhiren choked.

Of course, he knew the logic.

But he wasn't satisfied.

Wei Zhiren clenched his phone, his knuckles turning white.

He pursed his lips: ”I don't want to confront the Xu family; I just want to mess with Xu


Chapter 28:
Wei Ziming paused for a moment, then sighed, ”That's simple. Didn't you say that there were a few people who had been tormented by Xu Rongxuan and wanted your help?“

”You provide legal and financial assistance, and leave the rest to them. People with nothing to lose can be much more ruthless than you, who are hemmed in by constraints.“

Having finished speaking, Wei Ziming tapped Wei Zhen's head with the pen in his hand, ”Don't put yourself in the forefront to take the brunt of the attack. Since people are eager to use you as cannon fodder, be more cunning, understand?“

Having received the advice, Wei Zhen rubbed the spot that had been tapped, then massaged his brother's shoulders and neck diligently for ten minutes. Just as Wei Ziming was feeling comfortable, Wei Zhen patted his buttocks and dashed away.

He was the epitome of ruthless efficiency!

The author has a message to say: Xiao Cheng: We were supposed to work hard, but I feel deceived [Crying in a ball.jpg]



The biting wind carried away the greenery and vitality of the world, swirling with fallen leaves and discarded items, bringing a wave of chill.

Wei Zhen grabbed lunch at Blue Star and stepped out of the elevator to the parking garage beneath Blue Star's headquarters, shivering at the sudden cold air.

Only after he had climbed into the car did Wei Zhen finally relax, stretching his body stiffened by the cold, and started the engine.

After leaving Blue Star, Wei Zhen did not return directly to Weicheng. Instead, he first visited the future Weicheng Film Department building for an inspection. After seeing it with his own eyes and confirming that the project would not be delayed, Wei Zhen drove back to the office building where Weicheng was located.

Unfortunately, it started raining on his way back.

The air conditioning, combined with the humidifier, made the office comfortable, but the rain curtain falling outside the transparent glass window made one feel sticky and uncomfortable just by looking at it.

Upon entering his office, Wei Zhen hung his coat and turned to see two boxes of cream puffs placed on the transparent coffee table.

President Wei was taken aback, turned to open the door, and saw Assistant Wang walking in with a stack of documents. When he reached the door, he pointed to the two boxes on the desk.

”Yours?“ he asked.

Assistant Wang entered the office, shook his head, closed the door, and whispered, ”They were sent by Emperor Xiao.“

Wei Zhen: ”…?“

The confusion on the boss's face was too obvious, so Assistant Wang added, ”Emperor Xiao personally delivered them. He waited in the secretary's office for you all morning. When it was time for me to relieve Secretary Zhang, he left out of concern for the image.“

He paused, looked at his watch, ”He left just three minutes ago.“

Wei Zhen glanced out the window at the rain curtain that covered the entire sky in white, ”Did he bring an umbrella? Was he brought here by a driver?“

Assistant Wang was taken aback, shook his head, ”I'm not sure.“

Wei Zhen was about to put on the coat he had just hung up, picked up the rain umbrella from the office, and ran out without a word.

Holding the documents, Assistant Wang watched Wei Zhen's back and fell into deep thought.

Although the boss said there was no need for special treatment, Emperor Xiao… was indeed a charming little demon.

Assistant Wang thought this as he placed the documents on Wei Zhen's desk.

Wei Zhen carried the umbrella down to the underground parking garage.

Given Xiao Cheng's public attention, he would not wait in the lobby without a driver. Wei Zhen watched the elevator indicator smoothly reach the basement level. As the door opened, he quickly stepped out.

Emperor Xiao was standing near the entrance of the underground parking garage where the signal was available, blowing cold wind and talking to his agent on the phone.

Liu Xiaomai was very irate on the other end, ”Do you know that disturbing people on a date will get you kicked by a donkey!“

Xiao Cheng leaned against the wall to avoid the wind, ”Are you dating Qing?“

”…“ Liu Xiaomai paused, ”I was about to invite her!“

”Oh, then give up. There's no chance,“ Xiao Cheng broke Liu Xiaomai's fantasy coldly, ”Qing has an unexpected assignment today. You don't even know that and still want to chase after her?“

Liu Xiaomai wanted to give the cold and unforgiving Xiao Cheng a brick.

But he could only think about it, ”Where are you?“

”Underground parking garage beneath Weicheng,“ Xiao Cheng paused, looked around at the signs, and saw the D-2 exit sign. Just as he was about to tell Liu Xiaomai, he saw President Wei, dressed in a suit and looking somewhat disheveled and out of breath, standing beside the sign.

”President Wei?“ Xiao Cheng was quite surprised, then decisively whispered to Liu Xiaomai, ”You don't need to come.“

He hung up the phone with a snap, turned, and walked towards President Wei, whose clothes were slightly disheveled from his large strides.

Liu Xiaomai, whose phone had been hung up, ”…“

I'm telling you, if you act like this, you'll lose me as an agent.

However, Xiao Cheng did not care.

He was now looking at Wei Zhen, who was only half an arm's length away, from his disheveled hair to the umbrella in his hand and the leather shoes on his feet.

Wei Zhen froze when he saw Xiao Cheng.

President Wei was making efforts to treat this condition positively.

Angel Wei stabbed President Wei's heart with a needle, calming the rapidly beating heart for a moment.

Wei Zhen finally regained his breathing rhythm. He coughed, calming his mind, and said after a long pause, ”What a coincidence.“

Xiao Cheng looked at the tense Wei Zhen, whose facial muscles were slightly stiff, and could not help but want to laugh.

But he held it back, nodded, and replied, ”Yes, President Wei, what a coincidence.“

Then they fell into an eerie silence.

Wei Zhen tried to hold back what he wanted to say for a long time, but he felt that Xiao Cheng was too close.

So he slightly stepped back, what he thought was imperceptibly, then gathered courage to meet Xiao Cheng's gaze. In the next instant, he timidly looked away and dryly said, ”The cream puffs are delicious.“

After saying this, Wei Zhen fell into another eerie self-loathing.

Damn it, what's delicious!

I haven't eaten them yet!

Why can't I control my mouth!

Xiao Cheng also thought he moved slightly forward, getting even closer.

He seemed to not notice Wei Zhen's even stiffer expression, and said calmly, ”If President Wei likes them, President Wei, are you leaving for the day?“

Wei Zhen almost smelled the faint scent of laundry detergent on Xiao Cheng and the rain-soaked air from the tunnel entrance.

President Wei's mind was a mess.

Xiao Cheng seemed to urge, ”President Wei?“

Wei Zhen struggled to extract some rationality from the mess and answered the question from the nearby god, ”Not yet.“

He had been out all morning and was likely to have to work overtime.

Emperor Xiao got the answer he wanted and smiled slightly, then climbed up the ladder, ”Xiaomai has something to do, so can President Wei take me home after work?“

Wei Zhen instinctively felt something was wrong.

How could Xiao Cheng rely on Liu Xiaomai to go home? He could always hail a taxi.

Thinking this, he turned his head again to meet Xiao Cheng's gaze.

The light in the underground parking garage was dim, but Xiao Cheng's eyes were unusually bright at this moment.

—Like stars twinkling in the dark night, beautiful.

Wei Zhen blinked lightly, a strange emotion spreading over him, as if his soul had drifted away, and even his glasses seemed to be foggy.

His brain kept telling him to reject the request, but the words on the tip of his tongue seemed to be held back by an unknown force, detached from his mind and body.

The words rolled around his tongue twice before he finally said, ”Alright.“

Wei Zhen was stunned when the words came out of his mouth.

He stared at Xiao Cheng, feeling for a moment that this person was a fox that bewitched the world.

The author has a message to say: Xiao Cheng: Nonsense, I only tease you!

Wei Zhen: Look what I found! A lone wild fox! Let's sneak up to it… [Hilarious]


Chapter 29:
The cold outside did not affect the warmth indoors. Upon entering the cozy interior, Wei Zhirun instinctively shrugged off his coat and hung it on the coat rack by the door.

No sooner had he hung his coat when Wei Zhirun seemed to recall something, turning to look at the two boxes of cream puffs on the table.

Ah! Damn!

Sure enough, they were still there.

Wei Zhirun thought of how he had told Xiao Cheng that the cream puffs were delicious in the parking garage, and he stiffened momentarily, glancing at the fully armed Xiao Yingtai following behind him.

Xiao Yingtai also noticed those two familiar boxes and raised an eyebrow.

Wei Zhirun: ”…“

This was quite awkward.

But Xiao Cheng did not say anything, as if those two small boxes did not exist.

Wei Zhirun recalled how Xiao Cheng had waited for him at the office all morning, looking at his watch, which now read one o'clock precisely.

…One o'clock precisely, you just asked me if I was getting ready to leave for the day?

Wei Zhirun felt that Xiao Cheng's impression of him might be a bit off.

Did he look like the kind of irresponsible boss who would leave early?

…Well, he did.

Not only did he leave early, but he would sometimes be absent without reason.

Wei Zhirun silently suppressed his frustrations, his voice noticeably softer as he asked, ”Xiao Cheng, have you had lunch yet?“

Xiao Yingtai shook his head.

”You can sit wherever you like.“ Wei Zhirun opened the office door after speaking and looked at the secretary, ”Xiao Zhang, can you go to the cafeteria and get me a simple meal? Make it spicy…“

Xiao Cheng, who was taking off his armor and walking towards the sofa, paused and stopped him, saying, ”Mr. Wei, eating a simple meal in the office might leave a smell, so it's not necessary.“

Wei Zhirun, who often ate at his office: ”…“

Yes, this should be noted in his little book; he should try to eat less in the office in the future, to avoid Xiao Cheng smelling the food one day.

”Two pineapple tarts will do.“ Xiao Cheng said.

Upon hearing this, Wei Zhirun handed his cafeteria card to the secretary, ”Two pineapple tarts.“

The secretary took the card and went to the cafeteria downstairs.

Wei Zhirun closed the door and looked at Xiao Cheng, who was sitting on the sofa facing the cream puffs.

Wei Zhirun: ”…“

Don't remind me of this awkward situation, okay!

Xiao Cheng looked up at Wei Zhirun with a slight smile, ”Mr. Wei inviting me to lunch, it's only fair that I invite you to dinner?“

Wei Zhirun instinctively wanted to refuse.

Before he could even open his mouth, Xiao Cheng lightly tapped the small table and said half-jokingly, ”Mr. Wei, you shouldn't have any plans today, right?“

Wei Zhirun felt guilty.

He looked at Xiao Cheng for a long time before gently pushing up his glasses, ”No.“

Xiao Cheng seemed very pleased, ”Then, I will reserve a dinner for Mr. Wei.“

Wei Zhirun did not understand why Xiao Cheng was so insistent on inviting him to dinner.

—Even Brother Xiaoming, the life winner, said Xiao Cheng should offer himself to him!

While thinking, Wei Zhirun walked to his desk.

He glanced at Xiao Cheng, who was sitting beside the sofa with all his disguising tools removed, his breath paused for a moment, then he nervously took out the laptop from the drawer.

But thinking carefully, Xiao Cheng's attitude towards him was indeed abnormal.

He seemed… overly enthusiastic.

Wei Zhirun held the laptop and stood up, walking to Xiao Cheng and placing it down. He picked up the cream puffs at the same time.

Xiao Cheng's gaze followed the movement of the two boxes.

Wei Zhirun pretended not to see and pointed to the computer, ”Feel free to use it.“

Xiao Cheng nodded, ”Thank you, Mr. Wei.“

Wei Zhirun nodded coldly, holding the cream puffs and sitting back at his desk.

This is the cream puffs bought by my idol for me!

This is the cream puffs personally delivered by my idol for me!

This is the cream puffs bought by my idol, delivered personally, and waited for me all morning!

I can't eat it! I have to keep it!

Keep it! Let it last forever! Treat it as a family heirloom!

Wei Zhirun looked at the cream puffs on the table, feeling that he could not control his urge to eat them anymore.

He quickly stuffed the cream puffs into the drawer, calmed himself by touching the keyboard and mouse for a while, and then looked up to see Xiao Yingtai again.

Xiao Yingtai looked very relaxed, unlike how he always stood straight in photos, but he sank comfortably into the sofa, his computer on his lap, occasionally tapping the keyboard and mouse.

He looked extremely at ease, with a slight smile on his face, his eyes slightly closed, looking a bit drowsy. Under the cold white light, Xiao Cheng in his white sweater seemed to be glowing.

Wei Zhirun pushed up his glasses, his mind screaming wildly.

He felt that his plain glasses had a soft light filter, otherwise, how could Xiao Cheng seem to be glowing.

Wei Zhirun stared at Xiao Cheng, finally unable to bear it, taking off his glasses to wipe them clean, and then looked closely at Xiao Yingtai without glasses.

My Cheng is so handsome!

He really is glowing wuwuwuwQAQ

Xiao Cheng seemed to sense the intense gaze from the side and withdrew his view from the Weibo page with the username Zhirunzhirun, turning to meet Wei Zhirun's eyes.

The caught Wei Corporation President paused for a moment, his hand under the table clenching tightly.

He pursed his lips, his face stiff, and asked, ”I heard you waited for me all morning, is there something?“

Xiao Cheng slightly adjusted his lying position, the Xiao Yingtai in the photos that could cover the entire room naturally knew how to present the perfect self in others’ views.

He did not feel that seducing his future boss, his fan, was inappropriate.

Xiao Yingtai showed through his actions that he not only seduced with his looks but also boldly provoked him.

Xiao Cheng lightly tilted his chin, ”I came to the company to personally invite Mr. Wei.“

Wei Zhirun's figure slightly swayed, feeling the old deer in his heart wildly kicking his fragile heart.

He tried his best to maintain the cold and serious demeanor of a president, his hand holding the glasses trembling slightly.

”You could call… or send a WeChat message.“ He paused, ”No need to wait so long.“

Xiao Cheng laughed instantly, piercing through Wei Zhirun's small schemes, ”Just a call or a WeChat message, Mr. Wei would reject it, right?“

Wei Zhirun: ”…“

Unable to refute.

Because he really would reject.

—Especially looking at how Xiao Cheng acted now…

WuwuQUQ

Poor baby.

My idol, please don't misunderstand, I did not intend to reject you QUQ

Wei Zhirun's heart was drowning in an ocean of tears.

Overwhelmed by water, lost and helpless.

The helpless Wei Corporation President silently looked at Xiao Cheng for a while, ultimately choosing to escape reality and immerse himself in work.

Seeing that Wei Zhirun did not respond, Xiao Cheng did not disturb him but adjusted his posture again, ensuring that every time Wei Zhirun raised his head, he could see the perfect angle.

All-around, without死角, and with Wei President's fanboy filter!

Xiao Yingtai felt that his image must be twinkling like stars.

So cunning!

However, the cruel fact was that in the next few hours, Wei Zhirun, immersed in work and not thinking of his idol, did not look at Xiao Cheng even once!

Even when he raised his head, he only used the computer to look up information or ask the department head about work matters.

Xiao Yingtai felt a little hurt.

He could only force a smile, aimlessly browsing the web and watching dramas, occasionally raising his head to observe Wei Zhirun, enjoying his beauty.

Wei Zhirun's appearance was not bad, even in the entertainment industry, he would be considered above average.

In a suit, with black short hair, his gentle and affectionate almond eyes hidden behind gold-rimmed glasses, in the warm room, his white shirt buttoned up to the top, his tie neatly tied.

Especially Wei Zhirun's current focused and serious appearance as he immersed himself in work, was the perfect template of a cold, taciturn, ascetic, and silent social elite!

His attitude towards subordinates when working was like a standard tyrannical president.

…Unfortunately, his true personality completely changed in private.


Chapter 30:
Xiao Cheng sighed slightly, a subtle desire to see Wei Zhiren take off his glasses and revert to his exuberant personality flashing through his mind.

He had never seen President Wei let loose.

Xiao Cheng thought regretfully.

Wei Zhiren heard the sigh and raised his head blankly, pausing when he saw Xiao Cheng, as if just now remembering that there was a god of masculinity in the office besides himself.

No wonder everyone who came in to report work had such subtle expressions…

Wei Zhiren could already imagine what kind of gossip would circulate next.

Wei Zhiren felt a bit troubled. He rubbed his sore hands and neck, glancing at the time.

”It's almost six o'clock. Let's go,“ Wei Zhiren said, tidying up the documents he had signed. Looking at the stack of unfinished ones beside him, he could not help but sigh again.

This was the rhythm of working late after dinner.

Wei Zhiren called Wang Assistant in, handed him the signed documents, and noticed that Xiao Cheng had already put on his full armor.

Seeing Xiao Cheng dressed up like a thief, Wei Zhiren found it hilariously baffling.

Wei Zhiren and Xiao Cheng entered the elevator, and luckily, there was no one else inside.

Wei Zhiren adjusted his coat, finally feeling less tense: ”So, Emperor Xiao, where would you like to take me for dinner?“

”President Wei, you don't like Western food, right?“ Xiao Cheng, looking a bit stunned, explained: ”I discovered it last time.“

Wei Zhiren paused, then nodded.

”Then let's go to a casual restaurant I frequent.“ Emperor Xiao and President Wei stepped out of the elevator and entered the underground parking garage. ”It has good privacy and taste.“

Wei Zhiren opened the car door and saw Emperor Xiao sitting obediently in the passenger seat, feeling the old deer in his heart mischievously stirring again.



He glanced at Emperor Xiao, his heart stirring.

However, he could only stir in his heart.

He reached out but did not lift Xiao Cheng's chin. Instead, he quietly opened the navigation and entered the address Xiao Cheng had given.

Sigh, a president's ability but not a president's fate.

There had never been a president who was a fanboy.

Wei Zhiren felt extremely wronged as he drove.

The restaurant Xiao Cheng recommended was a bit off the beaten path, but this location was still quite valuable in a metropolis like City B.

Emperor Xiao watched as Wei Zhiren parked the car and led him inside.

Though it was called a casual restaurant, it was not small in scale. The restaurant was mainly built in traditional Chinese style, with faint traces of corridors and a large pond visible.

It looked more like a place for leisure and vacation.

Wei Zhiren noticed the cars and license plates parked outside. They were not the kind one could easily afford.

”How did I not know about this place before?“ Wei Zhiren felt it was illogical.

Hearing his mumbled complaint, Xiao Cheng explained: ”There are many people like me here. It's considered a safe haven where nothing goes wrong.“

He paused, observing the secretly observing Wei Zhiren, and added: ”Usually… no non-actors are brought here.“

Wei Zhiren was taken aback: ”Then…“

”However, the owner is my friend, so it's fine.“ Xiao Cheng said, reserving a private room at the front desk and leading Wei Zhiren through the lobby, turning down three corridors, and directly entering a VIP room.

The room was large, with a round table that could seat about twenty in the center.

But Xiao Cheng did not choose that table. Instead, he led Wei Zhiren to a smaller table hidden behind the large table, in the inner part of the room.

The small table faced a floor-to-ceiling window, outside which was a pond of green lotuses.

”A pity the flowers are gone and the lotus leaves are withered,“ Xiao Cheng glanced out the window.

Wei Zhiren did not mind. He watched the goldfish swim nearby and found it quite interesting.

Xiao Cheng picked up the two menus on the table, handing one to Wei Zhiren.

He asked, ”Take a look, what would you like?“

Wei Zhiren opened the menu and glanced at the recommended dishes on the cover. The bold, spicy steamed fish head caught his eye, occupying almost an entire page.

…It looked very spicy.

Wei Zhiren was silent for a moment, thinking his god of masculinity would like this.

”I'll have this one.“ Wei Zhiren spread the menu and lightly tapped that page.

Emperor Xiao withdrew his gaze from the menu, casually saying, ”Last time I came here, I had sweet and sour pork ribs. It was quite good, it should suit your taste…“

He stopped abruptly when he saw the page Wei Zhiren had tapped.

Wei Zhiren was also slightly stunned when he heard Xiao Cheng recommend sweet and sour pork ribs.

He remembered Xiao Cheng loving spicy food. Why did he order sweet and sour pork ribs? He seemed to have tried it before…

Could it be that Xiao Cheng was accommodating him to this extent?

Wei Zhiren looked up at Xiao Cheng in a daze.

Xiao Cheng also gazed at him blankly.

Xiao Cheng recalled Wei Zhiren telling Little Black Monkey that he was trying to eat spicy food.

Unfortunately, before he could develop a copper wall of tolerance to spicy food, he had been dragged out for dinner.

—Now he was probably accommodating his taste.

How should he put it?

It felt a bit… awkward… shy.

The goldfish outside the window swished its tail and dived underwater, the splash breaking the gaze of the two.

Emperor Xiao and President Wei awkwardly moved their gaze, noticing a faint red on both their ears.

Wei Zhiren lowered his head to look at the menu in front of him, the page with the spicy steamed fish head catching his eye again.

President Wei pushed his glasses up, coughed softly, his voice low: ”I can eat spicy food, this should… suit your taste.“

Xiao Cheng could not help softening his tone, his expression filled with tenderness: ”No need to force yourself, sweet dishes are also good. After all, I'm treating President Wei to dinner today.“

”It's okay!“ Wei Zhiren remembered that last time Xiao Cheng had accommodated him by ordering a bunch of desserts, but he himself had not eaten much, ”Order what you like.“

Emperor Xiao thought for a moment, ”Then I'll have a fish head and two sweet dishes, plus a dessert after the meal?“

After speaking, Xiao Cheng saw Wei Zhiren bring over a small square of cream dessert, ”So the dessert after the meal will be this?“

Wei Zhiren looked at the cream dessert on the table, hesitating.

…This was not an ordinary cream dessert, it was the one he planned to keep as a family heirloom!

Wei Zhiren's heart was filled with a thousand refusals.

Seeing Wei Zhiren's hesitation, years of chatting had enabled Xiao Cheng to easily guess Wei Zhiren's lively and exuberant personality.

Emperor Xiao lightly tapped the table, ”There's a good dessert shop near my place. Next time we have time, I'll bring you some.“

”Really?“ Wei Zhiren's eyes lit up clearly.

Xiao Cheng nodded.

Wei Zhiren finally nodded, reluctantly handing over the two boxes of cream dessert to Xiao Cheng.

Though his expression remained calm, the fixed gaze on the two boxes of dessert betrayed his inner desire.

Xiao Cheng almost couldn't help laughing.

He called the waiter to order the dishes and drinks, then leaned back, watching Wei Zhiren across from him.

The more Wei Zhiren relaxed, the more he felt tense under Xiao Cheng's gaze, feeling as if he would jump up and run away at any moment!

Xiao Cheng blinked, finally clearly seeing Wei Zhiren's embarrassment and tension up close.

He withdrew his gaze, pouring tea for Wei Zhiren, ”President Wei seems very afraid of me?“

Wei Zhiren pushed his glasses up.

”No,“ Wei Zhiren clarified, ”Your illusion.“

Xiao Cheng nodded, but it was clear that nodding did not mean he accepted the flimsy explanation.

He asked, ”Then why do you always look like you want to hide whenever you see me?“

Emperor Xiao finished his question without waiting for Wei Zhiren's answer, a smile appearing on his face, his tone light: ”Are you nervous?“

Wei Zhiren pushed his glasses up again—beyond this, he did not know what else to do.

Answering yes was wrong, answering no was wrong.

Caught between a rock and a hard place, he felt a bit mentally collapsing.

But Xiao Cheng did not retreat because of his silence. Instead, he asked again, ”Are you nervous?“

Wei Zhiren remained silent.


Chapter 31:
Emperor Xiao Ying lifted his face and raised the teacup to take a sip of tea, ”I can understand, as a fan suddenly seeing a real idol…“

Wei Zhiren's face was blank, immovable as a mountain.

Emperor Xiao Ying put down the teacup in his hand, ”But to be this nervous, Mr. Wei, is the first time I've seen.“

Wei Zhiren remained silent for a long time, adjusting his glasses again.

”Actually, over these years, you have hardly attended any events that allow close interaction with fans.“

The implication was that Xiao Cheng had actually never seen many fans, so he shouldn't mock him for being overly nervous.

Seeing that Wei Zhiren finally spoke, Xiao Cheng felt a bit happy.

—There is always progress.

”But I truly have never seen anyone like Mr. Wei,“ Xiao Cheng looked at Wei Zhiren earnestly, ”If I hadn't known from the start that you were that ’True Zhiren,‘ I would have thought I was being presumptuous and displeasing you.“

Wei Zhiren lowered his hand that was holding his glasses.

He licked his slightly dry lips, picked up the teacup, took a sip of the warm tea, and his voice sounded somewhat hoarse: ”…I do not hate you.“

Emperor Xiao Ying hurriedly climbed the ladder of flattery, asking, ”Then, does Mr. Wei like me?“

Wei Zhiren was so scared by this question that he choked on his tea, turning red as he struggled to breathe.

Xiao Cheng's face changed instantly; he hurriedly got up and ran to Wei Zhiren's side, patting his back to help him clear his airway.

Wei Zhiren finally managed to catch his breath, his glasses fallen and picked up by Xiao Cheng, placed to one side. His face was flushed, and even his eyes were tinged with tears.

Emperor Xiao Ying was extremely guilty; he looked at Wei Zhiren who was breathing heavily, ”I'm sorry, I…“

”No, no problem!“ Wei Zhiren stopped Xiao Cheng's apology as he was still gasping for breath.

My idol does everything right!

No need to apologize!

He took several deep breaths to calm his breathing, slightly tilting his head to look at Emperor Xiao Ying standing beside him, straightening up a bit.

Wei Zhiren stammered, ”I… I do not hate you, not only do I not hate you, I kind of like you.“

As he said this, the redness that had just subsided on his face rose arrogantly again.

—I really want to stand up and ask Xiao Cheng to marry me!

But President Wei was very cowardly, President Wei dared not.

Wei Zhiren looked at Xiao Cheng, his voice lowered, with a hint of complaint, ”I remember clearly… I said it the first time we met.“

Xiao Cheng looked at Wei Zhiren, who lowered his head slightly, seeming quite shy, and couldn't help wanting to reach out and tousle his fine black hair.

But just as his hand raised, he had to pull it back.

Because the waiter came in to deliver the dishes and knocked on the door.

Xiao Cheng sat back in his seat, missing the previous good opportunity, now he really couldn't bring himself to ask Wei Zhiren what aspect of his liking was.

If it was merely a fan's feelings for an idol… Xiao Cheng wouldn't be satisfied with that alone.

Emperor Xiao Ying looked at President Wei, who had put on his glasses again as if avoiding something, picked up his chopsticks, and was preparing to eat his bowl of rice.

—At least, I had a harvest today.

Thinking this way, Xiao Cheng finally mercifully withdrew his gaze from Wei Zhiren, shifting it to the fish head on the table.

Wei Zhiren looked at the fish head on the table, which Xiao Cheng had turned over to make it easier to remove the meat, feeling that within Xiao Cheng's line of sight, he was just like this dead ball, only able to be flipped over by Xiao Cheng.

Without any room to struggle, he was completely stripped clean.



He didn't ask Xiao Cheng for his address, but was lost in the shock of having confessed to Xiao Cheng face-to-face and couldn't pull himself away from it.

Then unconsciously, he followed the address of Xiao Cheng that he had secretly written down earlier and drove straight to the villa where Xiao Cheng lived.

At this time, the rain had stopped, leaving only the cold wind blowing fiercely.

Xiao Cheng raised an eyebrow in the passenger seat, somewhat surprised that Wei Zhiren actually knew his address so well.

—Of course, the most surprised was the guard at the door, who didn't even stop the car.

After Wei Zhiren stopped the car, Xiao Cheng unbuckled his seatbelt while asking, ”Does Mr. Wei often come to this neighborhood?“

Wei Zhiren nodded, ”Yeah, I have a friend living here.“

Xiao Cheng nodded in realization, then asked, ”Then how does Mr. Wei know I live here?“

And it seemed so familiar, completely unlike the first time he rushed over here.

Wei Zhiren pushed his glasses, pretending not to hear and didn't speak.

Xiao Cheng didn't tease him further, opened the car door, paused before getting out, and turned to look at President Wei in the driver's seat.

”Does Mr. Wei want to come in and sit?“

Wei Zhiren really wanted to agree, desperately wanting to agree.

But he was a principled fanboy, a professional president.

So President Wei, with his extremely high morals, refused Emperor Xiao Ying's invitation, left the neighborhood after seeing Emperor Xiao Ying enter the house and the lights turn on without any unusual situation.

—Just kidding!

I still have to rush back to work!

Wei Zhiren glanced at his watch, it was already nine o'clock at night; they had dined for more than two hours, usually he could finish his meal in the cafeteria in twenty minutes!

Beauty truly ruins things!

Wei Zhiren thought angrily on the way back to the company, and called home to inform his mother that he would be late tonight.

When Wei Zhiren's mother received the call, she said that even if he came back now, she wouldn't be able to see him.

Wei Zhiren was stunned, ”Mom?“

Wei Zhiren's mother's tone was filled with disdain, ”I'm on my thirtieth honeymoon with your father, don't call if you and your brother have nothing to say, it's very annoying!“

The despised Wei Zhiren: ”…“

Why do you always go on honeymoons so unexpectedly!

There's no longer a place for me, this salted fish, in this house.

You guys don't love me or Brother Xiaoming!

Wei Zhiren hung up the phone reluctantly, then called his brother, only to find that his brother was already bewildered in the empty house.

Wei Zhiren hung up the call to his brother, let out a long sigh of relief.

In this world where people are cold and indifferent, only my unlucky Brother Xiaoming still holds a bit of warmth for me.

Heh, happy!

With someone cushioning the bottom, President Wei happily hummed a tune on his way back to the company.

The overtime at Weicheng wasn't severe, but there were always some sudden incidents to handle.

When Wei Zhiren returned to the company at nine o'clock, the lights on this floor of Weicheng were still on.

A few staff members were still working hard behind their desks.

As soon as Wei Zhiren stepped in, he knocked on the notice board to draw the attention of the hardworking overtime workers, ”What do you want for midnight snacks?“

The overtime workers cheered, ”Long live Mr. Wei!“

Then they all put forward their requests.

”We want crayfish!“

”We want sour and spicy noodles!“

”I want meat-filled buns!“

”As long as there's meat, anything is fine!“

Wei Zhiren waved his hand, ”Order yourselves, I'll pay.“

”Thank you, Mr. Wei!“

”Mr. Wei, for a thousand autumns to unify the world!“

Wei Zhiren didn't want to deal with the pitiful people who were working overtime to the point of losing their minds, he returned to his office, and within five minutes of sitting down, he also joined the ranks of the mentally confused.

Even after browsing and confirming the signing of the last document, his mind was filled with profound philosophical questions such as ”Why do people have to work?“ ”What is the purpose of working overtime?“ ”Does correcting documents contribute to the progress of human society?“

Wei Zhiren lay on the table, feeling that he was even worse off than the fish head he had eaten today.

Worse than a salted fish steam fish head, President Wei, the salted fish, flailed his salted fish fins, took out his phone from his pocket.

Eleven o'clock.

Wei Zhiren sighed, seeing his friend's message on the screen.

Sent at nine thirty.

Little Black Monkey: Really, did you forget something?

After sending this message, Xiao Cheng, remembering that Wei Zhiren was driving, put down his phone to take a shower.

As a result, by the time he came out of the shower, the washing machine had finished washing the clothes, which had been hanging outside to dry for nearly an hour, before Xiao Cheng finally received Wei Zhiren's reply.

True Zhiren: Ah, sorry, I've been working overtime today, what's up? I've been quite busy lately and haven't been able to pamper you, so you must be lonely, my monkey?

Xiao Cheng frowned.

Little Black Monkey: Working overtime?


Chapter 32:
Wei Xianyu sighed, slumped on the table, unwilling to move, and did not seem like he was going to type on the keyboard, but instead tapped on his phone intermittently.

Zi Zhen Zhen Zhen: Yes! I was out roaming all morning today, so I had to work overtime in the afternoon.

Zi Zhen Zhen Zhen: Plus, the strange law that a large amount of work always surges before I clock out means I have to work hard even at night…

Zi Zhen Zhen Zhen: It feels so heart-wrenching. [Heartbreaking Hug of the Tiny Self.jpg]

When Xiao Cheng saw this, he could not help but realize that Wei Zhenzhen had gone out to eat with him without finishing her work, and thus had to rush back to the company to work overtime after dinner.

Xiao Cheng felt that he had caused trouble for Wei Zhenzhen.

He frowned slightly in frustration, wanting to apologize but realizing that this avatar did not have the right to do so. Switching back to Xiao Cheng himself, he felt at a loss.

Xiao Yingdi finally pursed his lips and lightly tapped his phone to reply.

Xiao Hei Houzi: Take care of yourself.

Wei Zhenzhen smiled happily at her friend's concern.

Zi Zhen Zhen Zhen: I'm fine! Listen, today Cheng came to find me again~ He seemed really enthusiastic about inviting me to dinner _(:з」∠)_

Zi Zhen Zhen Zhen: It felt like an old cad chasing someone—this cad doesn't know what else to do besides invite people to dinner [Jiang-style Indifference.jpg]—that's how it feels!

Xiao Hei Houzi: …

Xiao Cheng looked at this message and began to seriously consider what else he could do on dates with Wei Zhenzhen in the future.

…What could a couple do on a date?

Watch a movie?

That didn't seem right.

Standing outside the cinema entrance, he would most likely be recognized.

Public places were unsuitable.

So it could only be somewhere not many people knew him—like abroad.

Hmm, going on an overseas trip together would be a good choice.

Xiao Cheng thought about it and opened his laptop to note down the plan.

Meanwhile, Wei Zhenzhen was still struggling to get up with effort while tapping on her phone.

Zi Zhen Zhen Zhen: After we went to the restaurant, he ordered sweet food and I ordered spicy food—hahahahaah it felt so delicate! [Super Shy.jpg]

Zi Zhen Zhen Zhen: The sweet and spicy factions betrayed themselves and threw in the towel!

Zi Zhen Zhen Zhen: I saw Cheng's face turn red! >////< Oh my God, he's so adorable! [Incredibly Adorable]

Xiao Cheng thought to himself, you're lying, you turned red too.

And you didn't dare meet my gaze! You kept avoiding me!

Thinking about it, Xiao Cheng sent over six more taps.

Xiao Hei Houzi: …

After much effort, Wei Zhenzhen finally broke free from the ’sluggish fish‘ seal, stood up, and started to tidy up.

Zi Zhen Zhen Zhen: And today I even confessed to Cheng!

Zi Zhen Zhen Zhen: In person! Although I was still very nervous, I did confess—hahahaha [Strong Self Needs No Hug.jpg]

Wei Zhenzhen thought about it and felt incredibly excited, unable to stop!

Zi Zhen Zhen Zhen: Oh my goodness, I had already missed my chance with the god, but then my assistant told me that Cheng had only left three minutes ago. Seeing it was raining outside and not knowing if Cheng had an umbrella or a driver, I directly ran down!

Zi Zhen Zhen Zhen: You wouldn't believe it, when I found Cheng in the underground parking garage… his figure looked like a… homeless elderly person picking through trash, standing in the风口 making a phone call, very sorrowful.

Wei Zhenzhen thought of the image of Xiao Cheng's back she saw that afternoon and found it hilarious.

—Xiao Cheng was fully dressed to avoid attention, wearing something very unremarkable to avoid being noticed. From far away, his back did indeed look like a solitary elderly person picking through trash.

Especially when standing in the风口 with the wind blowing his clothes, he looked even more like it.

If not for Wei Zhenzhen's unwavering adoration of Xiao Cheng from all angles for ten years, she might not have recognized him.

The chief Wei felt that he was indeed a very impressive fan.

Just from recognizing Xiao Cheng, he felt he could compete with the First Lady of Hongqiao!

President Xiao Cheng put on his coat and left the office.

He was the last one to leave the company, checking all the doors, windows, and appliances, ensuring everything was locked and no one was around before the responsible CEO locked the door and entered the elevator.

In the elevator, he didn't rest, tapping on his phone at lightning speed.

Zi Zhen Zhen Zhen: I really regret not taking a picture at the time because I was too anxious to catch the god and my mind was not clear!

Zi Zhen Zhen Zhen: Cheng's back could have been the hottest gossip material for a year! [Suddenly Bursting into Laughter.jpg]

Zi Zhen Zhen Zhen: I couldn't resist the urge to care for the homeless god and led the shivering god back to the office! [Suddenly Excited.jpg]

Zi Zhen Zhen Zhen: [Feeling the red scarf on my chest more vibrant.jpg]

Homeless God Xiao Yingdi: ”…“

I suggest you be more careful with what you say.

Otherwise, you might end up being anal-punched in the future, you know?

There was still signal in the elevator, so Wei Zhenzhen flipped through the chat records and, upon seeing her friend's initial message, suddenly understood.

Zi Zhen Zhen Zhen: Oh, I was busy talking about my own things, you asked me what I forgot? I'm driving home now!

Xiao Cheng looked at this message, lightly sighed, and felt a little sour.

He replied slowly.

Xiao Hei Houzi: Xiao Cheng's birthday is this Saturday.

Xiao Hei Houzi: Didn't you forget?

Author's Note: Homeless God: …?

Wei Zhenzhen: [Heartbreaking Hug of the Fat Self.jpg]



Because President Wei was driving home, focused on the road.

Although Xiao Cheng had reminded Wei Zhenzhen about his birthday through the avatar, he himself had completely forgotten about it.

Ever since he chose to enter the entertainment industry and go against his family, Xiao Cheng had not properly celebrated a birthday in many years.

On his birthday, he happened to be in a period before the Christmas档 of the film industry, so most of the time, he was running around with the production team for promotions or补shooting scenes.

Only some thoughtful production teams and his agent would specially prepare a cake and sing a birthday song for him.

More often than not, he was still immersed in work, frantically pushing the schedule.

On the other hand, his busy work and the release of popular films during peak seasons proved that Xiao Cheng's current abilities and acting skills had been widely recognized by most industry insiders.

Over time, Xiao Cheng stopped caring about birthdays. Apart from posting a Weibo to thank his fans for their support, he watched his fans boost his popularity and send blessings like an unrelated bystander, as if it were a carnival.

This time, after finishing the shoot and not needing to promote, Xiao Cheng planned to rest properly, go to bed on time, and flirt with President Wei—he did not give his birthday a second thought.

Unfortunately, today, while using Wei Zhenzhen's laptop to browse Weibo in her office, Xiao Cheng saw many of Wei Zhenzhen's fans mobilizing on her homepage to prepare for his upcoming birthday.

As usual, they would work hard to boost his popularity and topics on his birthday, trying to drown him in blessings as he was caught in the storm.

Seeing her fans working hard for him, Xiao Cheng was deeply moved.

So he liked every single Weibo he saw.

—Additional note: The default Weibo account logged into that laptop was Zi Zhen Zhen Zhen.

After liking all the posts, Xiao Yingdi suddenly remembered that this year, Wei Zhenzhen did not seem excited about participating in the preparations.

In previous years, Wei Zhenzhen would excitedly tell Xiao Hei Houzi a month in advance how she planned to celebrate.

But not this year.

So Xiao Cheng cautiously probed through the avatar.

If she had forgotten, he could remind her. If she hadn't, he could look forward to this year's birthday gift.

Wei Zhenzhen parked the car and stepped out of the garage.

The surroundings were quiet, with the wind howling. The lights on the courtyard wall still illuminated the path for people walking.

Wei Zhenzhen hunched her shoulders, running quickly, feeling that she should have worn a down jacket in this weather.

The lights were on at the entrance of the villa, but the house was silent.

It seemed that Xiao Ming, the winner of life, had already gone to sleep, abandoning his brother who was working overtime until he was delirious.

Wei Zhenzhen changed her shoes and turned on the lights in the living room.


Chapter 33:
Thinking that his brother still had a conscience, he had left a light on for him at the gateway.

Wei Zhiren rubbed his hands and rushed straight to his room, turning on the air conditioner and falling onto the bed, hugging the still cold electric blanket and shivering.

The room quickly warmed up.

Wei Zhiren snuggled into the quilt and reached for his phone.

Xiao Heihouzi's message was still hanging there.

Wei Zhiren looked at his companion's words and felt that his companion's understanding of him was still too superficial.

Zhiren Zhiren: My Monkey! Do you think Xiao Cheng got someone else's love!

The reply came quickly on the other side, but there were only six dots.

Xiao Heihouzi: …

Xiao Cheng was puzzled for a moment, staring at Wei Zhiren's message, and didn't understand what it meant for a long time.

He understood the reference, but why ask like this?

Xiao Yindi remained silent for a while, but still decided to go along with the reference first.

Xiao Heihouzi: … The love of a celestial deity?

Zhiren Zhiren: …

Wei Zhiren never expected his monkey companion to be so straightforward in responding to the reference.

Zhiren Zhiren: I can't continue this conversation [Despairful gaze.jpg]

Xiao Heihouzi: ?

Zhiren Zhiren: Am I the kind of person who forgets my idol's birthday!?

Xiao Cheng thought carefully about it.

Indeed, he did not.

He honestly replied to Wei Zhiren's question.

Xiao Heihouzi: No.

Xiao Heihouzi: But you haven't mentioned this to me for years, I thought you had forgotten.

Zhiren Zhiren: Because I've been quite busy this year, my Monkey [Caring gaze.jpg]

Zhiren Zhiren: All the sweat I've shed this year is from the water I've swum in over the past few years! This year's me is no longer a dried-up fish!

Xiao Yindi understood what President Wei meant.

He had not forgotten his birthday.

Xiao Cheng looked at the push notification on the screen, tapping his phone while secretly hoping.

Xiao Heihouzi: Then I'm going to expel you from the ranks of dried-up fish.

Zhiren Zhiren: No! Mr. Monkey Boss, don't treat me like this! [Eat me with a Fish Stab.jpg]

Xiao Yindi remained silent for a moment, but finally couldn't resist and cautiously asked.

Xiao Heihouzi: This year you officially got to know Xiao Cheng, what gift are you planning to give him?

Wei Zhiren had originally put down his phone and was preparing to take a bath and go to sleep, but upon seeing this message, his brow twitched instantly.

Zhiren Zhiren: Mr. Monkey who wishes to remain anonymous, I have a question for you.

Xiao Heihouzi: Ask.

Zhiren Zhiren: Was it Cheng who dispatched you to gather military intelligence?

Xiao Yindi, who had been seen through: ”…“

However, Xiao Yindi held tightly onto his vest and did not admit it.

He had a face of absolute integrity.

Xiao Heihouzi: No, just curious.

Xiao Cheng felt that the birthday gift he had given Wei Zhiren before was filled with heartfelt intentions.

Following the normal routine, he had given his past to President Wei. So, shouldn't President Wei be giving him his future?

For example, packing himself up as a gift and delivering it right to his door.

Anyway, he knew the family address inside and out. Maybe on his birthday, he would hear the doorbell ring early in the morning, open the door, and see President Wei blushing and saying, ”I'm giving myself to you.“

Just thinking about it made him feel incredibly thrilled.

Xiao Yindi lay in bed imagining such a scene, feeling he could hardly hold back from laughing.

However, President Wei did not know about the wild train of thought in Xiao Yindi's mind.

Zhiren Zhiren: Don't worry! I've already prepared a super awesome gift for Cheng!

Zhiren Zhiren: Cheng is definitely going to like it!

Xiao Yindi looked at these two messages, feeling satisfied as he finished his grooming and climbed into bed.

He was just waiting for President Wei to pack himself up as a gift and deliver it right to his door.

Wei Zhiren hummed a tune while taking a bath, his head still dripping wet, a towel perched atop his dripping hair, wearing a bathrobe and slippers, tapping-tapping his way to Wei Ziming's study.

He squatted and rummaged through his brother's file pile for half an hour before finally finding what he was looking for.

President Wei held that document and happily returned to his room.

…

Saturday.

Wei Zhiren woke up early, changing over a dozen clothes under his brother's deathly glare due to insufficient sleep.

Wei Ziming could no longer bear it, ”You're changing the same style and the same color! What's so good about changing suits! Don't you have regular clothes in your other closet!?“

Wei Zhiren缩 back his neck, ”Wouldn't wearing regular clothes feel too frivolous?“

”…“ Wei Ziming looked at his younger brother in disbelief, ”Do you think you're a very steady person?“

Wei Zhiren: ”…“

I'm not.

I hope you don't expose me again.

Wei Zhiren looked at his brother and, with courage, stuck out his neck and said, ”But I'm going to meet Xiao Cheng…“

Wei Ziming interrupted his younger brother's words coldly, ”I think Xiao Cheng would rather see you wearing regular clothes than a suit.“

Saying this, Big Winner Little Ming Brother directly pulled out a blue and white plaid shirt and a thick pair of jeans. After thinking for a moment, he tossed out a dark blue down jacket.

”Put on this, plus those sneakers with the insoles!“

”… Why should I wear insoles?“ Wei Zhiren felt that the height difference between him and Xiao Yindi was quite suitable.

Wei Ziming tugged his younger brother's face forcefully, ”You can't lose in terms of presence, do you understand!“

Being shorter, he had already lost a lot in terms of presence.

Wei Zhiren nodded, standing at attention unclearly, ”Okay, Little Ming, yes, Little Ming!“

Little Ming Brother looked at Little Zhen Brother who changed clothes in the blink of an eye. Then, without even acknowledging the hardworking elder brother, Little Zhen Brother slipped on the long down jacket and dashed out the door.

Wei Ziming returned to his room coldly, deeply feeling that his younger brother had grown up and was harder to handle.

Not only harder to handle, but it seemed he was about to be bumped off by someone else's pig.

And even eager to be bumped off.

Big Winner Little Ming Brother, who had fretted his heart, sighed deeply.

When Xiao Cheng heard the doorbell ring early in the morning, his mind was still a bit fuzzy.

Until he saw Wei Zhiren standing at the door through the surveillance camera, he was completely stunned.

Wei Zhiren was not wearing a suit and was not wearing glasses.

In the camera, he was looking around, his lips pursed, looking a bit nervous. Without the glasses to hide them, his peach blossom eyes were extremely lively, currently anxiously rubbing his down jacket.

Such a President Wei looked like a freshly graduated university student.

… Could my wish have come true?

Xiao Yindi thought, then quickly tidied up his appearance, which had been relaxed at home. When he opened the door for President Wei, he was once again the splendid Xiao Yindi.

Wei Zhiren saw Xiao Yindi open the door, his gaze sweeping over Xiao Cheng at the gateway. Unfortunately,


Chapter 34:
Xiao Cheng took a pair of cotton slippers from the shoe cabinet; they looked brand new, as if no one had worn them.

Xiao Yindi watched Wei Zhiren quietly put on the shoes and explained, ”There are rarely any guests in our home; basically, the only one who comes over is Xiao Mai.“

Wei Zhiren mumbled a response and followed Xiao Cheng inside.

The interior design style of Xiao Cheng's home exceeded Wei Zhiren's expectations. He had presumed that the room behind the heavily veiled foyer would be decorated in a cold, ascetic color palette, but what greeted his eyes was filled with a warm, uplifting ambience.

The floor was covered in soft, warm knitted carpets, the walls adorned with a few warm-toned countryside landscapes, the curtains a pearly white embroidered with delicate flowers, with tassels hanging just two centimeters from the ground.

The lighting in the living room was bright and orange, the walls a slightly softer beige.

The sofa was not the stiff leather variety but rather a collection of various recliners and cushions casually placed on the carpet.

—Overall, it looked cozy and warm, completely different from Xiao Cheng's long-established cold and aloof persona.

However, it was clear that the owner of this house was a rather carefree and enthusiastic person who enjoyed life.

Xiao Cheng, observing Wei Zhiren's exploration of the room, said, ”Mr. Wei, feel free to sit wherever you like.“

Wei Zhiren glanced around, finally choosing a light green recliner and sank into it comfortably.

Xiao Yindi walked towards the dining room, his actions halting as he took out the tea canister.

He turned to face Wei Zhiren, who looked somewhat bewildered in the living room, and raised his voice, asking, ”Mr. Wei, have you had breakfast?“

Wei Zhiren looked up at his idol and shook his head.

Xiao Cheng frowned, ”Why did you rush over without having breakfast? It would be the same if you had just messaged me.“

Mr. Wei was momentarily stunned by the question.

In reality, he had not thought about it much. After finishing everything in the morning, he had rushed over to intercept him.

He did not even know if Xiao Cheng had plans for the day.

Mr. Wei stared at Xiao Yindi for a long time, finally stammering, ”Well… because inviting you in person… seems more sincere?“

He used the same half-hearted explanation Xiao Cheng had given him when he invited him over previously.

And it was phrased as a question.

Xiao Yindi chuckled.

He put the tea canister back, poured Wei Zhiren a glass of warm water, and returned to the living room, handing it to Wei Zhiren, ”I haven't had breakfast either. If Mr. Wei doesn't mind, he can try my cooking?“

Wei Zhiren looked utterly bewildered.

What?

Xiao Cheng could cook?

Yes?

And he was going to cook for him?

Wei Zhiren held the glass of warm water in both hands, his heart pounding with excitement, his expression serious, ”Of course, I don't mind!“

That was a given!

Who would mind dying for it!

Wei Zhiren watched Xiao Cheng's retreating back as he entered the kitchen, glancing at his watch.

Nine in the morning.

…He seemed to have come a bit early?

Soon, the kitchen filled with the aroma of cooking.

Wei Zhiren sipped the water his idol had poured for him, occasionally pinching his leg.

It was not a dream.

Xiao Yindi had not prepared any particularly difficult dishes; he had simply made a simple breakfast of eggs, bacon, and sandwiches.

He arranged the four halved sandwiches neatly on a plate and carried them to the dining table, then went back to the kitchen to prepare the milk.

Wei Zhiren pulled himself out of the recliner, bounced into the dining room, and sat in front of the two plates of sandwiches.

Mr. Wei looked at Xiao Yindi rummaging for milk powder in the kitchen, then at the brightly colored sandwiches on the table, hesitated for three seconds, and could not resist taking out his phone to snap a dozen photos from different angles.

By the time Xiao Yindi had finished boiling the milk as Mr. Wei took his eighth photo, he saw Wei Zhiren snapping pictures in the dining room and retracted his steps from the kitchen.

Once the rustling sounds ceased, Xiao Yindi brought out two glasses of milk at the right temperature and directly sat down to Wei Zhiren's left.

Wei Zhiren reached out to take the milk.

Xiao Yindi pulled back his right hand, which was closer to Wei Zhiren, and handed him the milk in his left hand.

And explained, ”This one has honey.“

Wei Zhiren took the warm glass, frozen for a moment, then quietly turned his head, reaching to tuck his short, messy hair behind his ears, trying to hide the ears that had instantly turned red.

Wei Zhiren felt his life was complete eating sandwiches made by Xiao Cheng, enjoying breakfast prepared by his dream lover, and drinking honey milk poured by his dream lover.

Who else?

Who could be happier than him!

Wei Zhiren took a sip of milk, feeling the warmth spread from his stomach to his heart, the honey flavor carrying the scent of flowers, like a gentle breeze soothing his restless heart, sweet and warm, with a seductive aroma.

Xiao Cheng tilted his head to look at Wei Zhiren, asking, ”Does Mr. Wei have any plans for the morning?“

Wei Zhiren swallowed his milk, blinking blankly.

Xiao Yindi immediately felt balanced.

Sure enough, Mr. Wei was as clueless about dates as he was; they were equally incompetent, a perfect match!

Thinking that he had naturally planned their time together as a date, Xiao Yindi stood up and walked towards the room next to his bedroom.

Still trailing behind him was his devoted fan.

Inside the room was a large-screen LCD television.

”It's still early; how about we watch some of my collection?“ Xiao Yindi waved a DVD in front of Wei Zhiren.

Xiao Cheng's collection consisted of an entire wall of cabinets, neatly stacked with countless DVDs.

Wei Zhiren recognized this cabinet, as Xiao Cheng had posted pictures of his collection on Weibo.

They were a variety of DVDs, both limited and unlimited editions, modern and ancient.

Xiao Yindi's dedication was well-known; there were obvious signs of frequent handling on the DVDs.

Seeing that Wei Zhiren did not object, Xiao Cheng asked, ”Which one do you want to see?“

Wei Zhiren was still puzzled by the titles on the DVDs. The only films he watched regularly were those featuring Xiao Cheng.

Mr. Wei thought for a moment, casually picked a DVD he found appealing, and handed it to Xiao Cheng.

Xiao Yindi took the DVD, raised an eyebrow, and without saying anything, opened the protective case.

There was only one recliner in the room, directly facing the large screen, likely for two people, but it could be used for sitting or lying down comfortably if used alone.

Wei Zhiren obediently sat on the left side.

Xiao Cheng placed the DVD and sat down on the right side as well.

Unfortunately, Wei Zhiren had picked an artistic film, a winner of an Oscar.

The film had a dark tone, a complex plot, and a somber soundtrack.

Wei Zhiren watched the film intently, finding he understood every line the actors spoke, but the overall storyline left him baffled.

Mr. Wei did not understand the nuances of cinematography and subtext.

He felt that the screenwriter and director must have drunk fake alcohol.

After half an hour of watching, Mr. Wei shifted from serious viewing to ”Hmm, it seems the fake alcohol is quite strong,“ then to ”My God, he seems to understand it, does that mean I'm too stupid,“ and finally to ”Who am I, where am I, why did I choose this movie?“

Mr. Wei watched the film blankly, occasionally glancing at Xiao Yindi, who watched the film with intense focus.

Then he very honestly… fell asleep.

Xiao Yindi watched Wei Zhiren's head nodding off beside him, silently sighing.

He reached out to support Wei Zhiren's head, letting him rest comfortably against his shoulder.

Wei Zhiren slept soundly.

Perhaps it was the soft recliner, the warm air conditioning, the soothing soundtrack, or the comforting presence of the person beside him.

Until he was gently awakened by a soft voice, Wei Zhiren did not realize he had fallen asleep sitting down.

As if he had been lying on a warm, soft bed at home.

Mr. Wei opened his eyes groggily, seeing Xiao Yindi's face inches away.

Graceful and handsome, with a faint scent of fragrance.

Wei Zhiren reached out groggily, hugged the person beside him, and pressed his head into the shoulder, rubbing against it fiercely.


Chapter 35:
Weizong, with his head buried in Xiao Cheng's shoulder, mumbled, ”Good morning, handsome!“

A warm, moist breath sprayed near his collarbone, making Xiao Cheng feel as if a current of electricity had crawled over him.

Emperor Xiao Ying looked utterly stunned, unsure how to react.

Weizong released him, sat up abruptly, and instinctively prepared to get out of bed to wash up.

Just as he sat straight, he saw the closing credits of a movie playing not far ahead, and turning his head, he was shocked to see the entire cabinet of DVDs. Instantly, he awoke fully.

He turned his head to look at Emperor Xiao Ying sitting beside him.

Emperor Xiao Ying had already put away his stunned expression, now looking at him with a slight smile.

Weizong's heart crumbled.

What did I do!?

Just now!?

What did I do!?

Emperor Xiao Ying, seeing Weizong's expressionless, rigid face, opened his arms toward Mr. President and asked with a smile, ”Mr. President, would you like another cuddle?“

Weizong: ”……“

F*ck!

I want it!

Mr. President couldn't help pushing his glasses, only to find his hand met with emptiness.

Weizong then recalled that he hadn't worn his glasses today.

He awkwardly lowered his hand, went through intense mental turmoil, and finally, with a heart that felt like it was being torn apart, shifted his gaze.

Weizong, whose heart was wailing internally, forced himself to calm down.

He then dryly changed the subject, ”…Let's go out to eat.“

Author's Note:
Xiao Cheng: No problem, come on, come for a cuddle!)[Opens arms]
Weizong: That's practically a shipping scene!



He felt that Weizong, without his serious and proper suit and without the glasses that hid his beautiful almond eyes, looked very cute.

His obvious nervousness and shyness when alone with him was cute, his awkwardness in responding to his advances was cute, his attempt to cover his red earlobes with a strand of hair was cute, and his constant care for him but unwillingness to voice it was also very cute.

However, Weizong now looked like a startled rabbit, and Xiao Cheng felt that any further provocation would make Weizong run away in panic.

Emperor Xiao Ying did not wish for his joyful birthday to end at noon.

Thinking this, Xiao Cheng stood up, straightened his pajamas that had become disheveled by Weizong's cuddling, and slowly spoke to Mr. President under his watchful gaze, ”Mr. President, I…“

Mr. President shot out of the room.

Xiao Cheng: ”…“

He just wanted to say he was going to change clothes.

Weizong closed the room door, about to leave, but paused for a moment, hesitating at the door before gently knocking.

Without waiting for Xiao Cheng's response or the door to open, he stood outside and called out, ”I'm waiting for you in the living room!“

He then shuffled off to the living room in his slippers.

Standing in the room, Emperor Xiao Ying chuckled softly after a moment, stretched his sore shoulders, tidied up the room, and then went to his own room to change clothes before strolling out calmly.

Weizong stood in the living room, staring at the soft green recliner he had been sitting on previously.

On that recliner lay his black shoulder bag.

Mr. President's face was grave.

He was reflecting.

Reflecting on how careless he had been, revealing himself to the handsome man.

His persona was almost ruined; could he continue to maintain it…

Weizong was extremely distressed.

He instinctively felt that his true self, that carefree and fangirling personality, was abnormal in the eyes of most people.

Otherwise, his friends wouldn't mock him for being gay.

Mr. President wasn't sure if Xiao Cheng would think he was gay like his group of friends.

Perhaps, after realizing, he would feel Xiao Cheng was after the same thing as Xu Rongxuan and distance himself!

Just thinking about this possibility made Weizong feel unbearable.

Weizong didn't want to be distanced by Xiao Cheng.

—In fact, when he found out that Xiao Cheng knew he was ”Zhenzhenzhen“ and didn't mind, Weizong felt a sense of relief as if he had survived a disaster.

The handsome man didn't mind his identity as a die-hard fan.

The handsome man also didn't think much of his insistence on investing for ten years.

The handsome man chose to believe him, to indulge him, and even to repay him.

Weizong felt that Xiao Cheng was so good, it made him a bit anxious.

Weizong felt he should be more cautious and excellent, rather than revealing his personality that was completely unrelated to calmness and stability and was extremely eccentric.

…In any case, discovering that his boss was a crazily using emojis and stickers little浪cat would surely make him uneasy.

Especially since Weizong's thoughts about Xiao Cheng were almost common knowledge among his closest friends.

If Xiao Cheng discovered his thoughts…

The imagined scene was too horrific; Weizong refused to continue thinking about it.

After thoroughly enjoying the expression changes on Weizong's face from afar, Xiao Cheng raised his hand and gently knocked on the door.

”Mr. President, let's go?“

Weizong snapped out of it, turning to look at Xiao Cheng leaning against the door.

The orange-yellow light inside the room bathed Emperor Xiao Ying's handsome face in a faint golden glow.

Weizong felt his fangirling filter starting to slip out of control.

He pulled back his gaze, took a deep breath, picked up his bag, and hurriedly said, ”I'll go drive.“

Xiao Cheng, with his long legs, crossed a few steps to catch up with Weizong, who was bent over walking to the door, his tone calm and unhurried, ”Mr. President, you don't look good, I'll drive.“

Weizong didn't think and retorted, ”What's wrong with me?“

”You just woke up,“ Xiao Cheng finished changing his shoes, ”Didn't you sleep well last night?“

Weizong lowered his head, pursed his lips, and finally handed the car keys to Xiao Cheng, squatting down to tie his shoelaces.

Xiao Cheng watched Weizong, who had tied his shoelaces and stood up, and sized him up slightly.

He wasn't quite sure, ”Mr. President, did you… grow taller?“

Weizong in his inner-soled shoes: ”……“

Why be so sensitive about this!?

Feeling embarrassed after being caught!

Didn't anyone tell me that Cheng shouldn't be so honest and straightforward, saying whatever comes to mind!?

Mr. President didn't know how to respond, so he pretended not to have heard and walked out directly.

Xiao Cheng's gaze fell on Weizong's high-top sneakers, raising an eyebrow in realization.

The temperature outside was still somewhat low, with the north wind bitterly blowing across the ground.

Weizong shivered when the wind hit him.

Xiao Cheng locked the door and caught up with Mr. President, looking at the shivering Weizong and turned to stand in the upwind position.

Weizong only felt the wind seemed to have lessened and didn't mind much.

His car was parked next to Xiao Cheng's house. He unlocked it and directly opened the passenger door and got in.

Inside the car, there was no wind.

Mr. President sighed in relief.

He turned to look at Emperor Xiao Ying, who was familiar with the car's operation, then grabbed the seatbelt, reached for the buckle, and clicked it into place.

When confirming if it was fastened, Weizong's hand touched another slightly cold hand.

Mr. President was startled, turned his head, and retracted his hand as if electrocuted, turning to look out the window at the branches dancing wildly in the north wind.

His earlobes were red.

Xiao Cheng couldn't help but laugh softly, suppressing the urge to laugh aloud, and asked, ”Where is Mr. President going?“

His voice had a slight tremble, rising at the end, clearly showing the joy of the speaker.

Weizong didn't turn around, ”To the same restaurant we went to last time.“

It wouldn't cause any trouble, and sweet and sour spare ribs were delicious. Xiao Cheng also enjoyed the fish head.

Xiao Cheng nodded, turned to fasten his seatbelt, and then saw a beautifully packaged small birthday cake on the back seat.

Emperor Xiao Ying's smile grew brighter and more radiant.

He pretended not to notice, turned his head, and started the car.

Weizong watched the streets quickly retreating outside the car window and turned the air conditioning to face him.


Chapter 36:
President Wei was seriously contemplating the matter of Emperor Xiao Ying.

He felt that Emperor Xiao Ying's demeanor was not quite normal.

He could not comprehend why Emperor Xiao Ying, in private, displayed the mannerisms of a skilled flirt, when it was so clear that for all these years he had been keeping a close eye on Xiao Cheng, who seemed like a hermit. Not only did he lack a girlfriend, but even rumors about him were scarce.

Then why did every word and every action of Xiao Cheng seem as if he were flirting with him?

How could he be so proficient at it?

Even if he had a built-in fanboy filter, it did not make sense.

Mr. President was deeply concerned and could not resist turning his head from time to time to observe Emperor Xiao Ying driving carefully.

Seeing him once or twice was understandable, and even three or four times could be tolerated.

However, looking at him eight or nine times in the middle of two red lights made Emperor Xiao Ying somewhat uneasy.

”President Wei, why do you keep looking at me?“ Just as they reached a red light, Emperor Xiao Ying pressed the brake and could not help but ask.

He touched his face, ”Is there something wrong?“

Wei Zhen silently redirected his gaze, feeling too embarrassed to ask Xiao Cheng if he was flirting with him.

So he remained silent for half the duration of the red light and managed to blurt out three words: ”You are handsome.“

Xiao Cheng: ”……“

Though this excuse was rather flimsy, I accept it.

Emperor Xiao Ying turned his head and looked directly at President Wei sitting in the passenger seat.

Wei Zhen shifted uncomfortably towards the car door, ”What are you looking at?“

Xiao Cheng smiled and said, ”Because President Wei is handsome.“

Wei Zhen: ”……“

Wei Zhen felt as if a honey-coated arrow had pierced through his heart, making him feel thoroughly chilled.

Honey overflowed in his heart, spreading rapidly to every corner of his body with his racing heartbeat.

Being thrown into a honey pot must feel like this.

Wei Zhen struggled to turn his head and look out the window, his hand tightly clenched into a fist.

His heart was screaming in desperation.

Who?

Who can save me?

I might be dying!

I am drowning in the gaze of my idol!

Help!

However, no one could save Mr. President, but his condition did not worsen.

Because the green light had turned on.

Emperor Xiao Ying redirected his gaze, and the car resumed its journey.

He let go of President Wei, to prevent him from getting too embarrassed and jumping out of the car on the street.

Such behavior was too dangerous, and Emperor Xiao Ying did not wish to see it.

They went to the same private room as before.

Last time, Wei Zhen had brought two boxes of cream puffs, but this time he carried a small birthday cake.

Xiao Cheng placed the order while Wei Zhen opened the cake and carefully inserted the candles with the numbers 2 and 9.

Seeing Emperor Xiao Ying put down the menu, Wei Zhen handed him the lighter, ”You order.“

Xiao Cheng did not hesitate, pulled the curtain to block the bright sunlight, and lit the candles.

He then took out his phone to take a photo, preparing to post it on Weibo.

Wei Zhen watched as Xiao Cheng edited his Weibo post and looked at the burning candles. After hesitating for three seconds, he cleared his throat and sang ”Happy Birthday“ to Xiao Cheng.

Wei Zhen did not have a particularly good voice, almost described as tone-deaf, with awkward vocal transitions, but the warm smile on Emperor Xiao Ying's face grew broader, his satisfaction and joy almost spilling over.

After finishing the song, Wei Zhen's expression was somewhat awkward and uneasy.

He was well aware that his singing skills were poor; in a group chat, his voice would clear out an entire KTV room.

Xiao Cheng gave a small thank you, made a symbolic wish, and blew out the candles.

Wei Zhen pulled back the curtain and fished out a thin document from his bag, the one he had retrieved from his brother's study late at night a few days ago.

Wei Zhen handed the document to Xiao Cheng.

”Birthday gift,“ Mr. President whispered.

Xiao Cheng was taken aback, guessing what it could be, and then took the document and opened it, his eyes widening in shock.

It was an audition opportunity.

For domestic actors, this was a very precious audition opportunity.

An invitation from an internationally renowned director, inviting him to M Country to audition for the role of the third male lead in one of his famous series of movies.

Seeing Xiao Cheng's stunned expression, Wei Zhen blinked and asked, ”Do you like it?“

Emperor Xiao Ying came back to reality and looked at President Wei.

This was the first time Emperor Xiao Ying clearly understood what resource allocation meant.

Author's Note: Xiao Cheng: No, you said you would give me the future?!

Wei Zhen: ? Who said so? [Stunned Eyes.jpg]



When he was thinking about what gift to give Xiao Cheng, he had racked his brain.

Xiao Cheng had worked hard over the years, been treated harshly by Light and Shadow, but he had also earned a considerable amount of money.

There were things and luxuries that could be bought with money, which Xiao Cheng definitely did not lack.

Therefore, he should give him something that could not be bought with money.

Wei Zhen had long passed the age of gifting his own handmade creations to someone he liked, and when thinking about business matters, he was completely logical.

What could not be bought with money was precious interpersonal connections.

These connections brought swift information and resources.

Wei Zhen had spent a long time persuading his brother and father to get this opportunity for Xiao Cheng, and finally, his father had gone to the director to recommend Xiao Cheng, along with a series of his works—the director was his father's drinking buddy.

It was also because Xiao Cheng's own works were excellent; otherwise, this invitation would not have ended up with Wei Zhen.

Emperor Xiao Ying naturally liked this gift.

He did not possess the workaholic nature that Wei Zhen thought he had. He had always pretended to love his work because of the ”devotion to duty“ he had been taught.

Moreover, he also wanted to frustrate Light and Shadow, who constantly set obstacles in his way, which was why he had always worked so hard.

In fact, before his mother had approached him, Xiao Cheng had planned to retire from the entertainment industry.

He had no nostalgia for this glamorous circle.

Over the years, the greatest gain Xiao Cheng had from staying in this circle was having several close friends and acquaintances. As for fame, wealth, and power, they were not within Emperor Xiao Ying's considerations.

However, the reason he wanted to leave this circle was also due to fatigue and a cold heart.

Everything he had now was the result of his hard work, without any support from the company, and he often had to guard against Xu Rongxuan's sudden attacks.

No one in Light and Shadow dared to speak up for him—except for Liu Xiaomai.

Those who dared to speak up were friends from other companies.

Such experiences made Xiao Cheng extremely suspicious and distrustful of entertainment agencies.

Without Wei Zhen, he might have announced his retirement after his contract with Light and Shadow ended, bought a house in a scenic place, and retired early.

Emperor Xiao Ying carefully put away the audition invitation and solemnly thanked Wei Zhen.

Wei Zhen was a bit flustered, his voice rising slightly, ”I said it was a birthday gift, why thank me!“

Emperor Xiao Ying's lips curled, ”When you receive a gift, you should thank the giver.“

After saying that, Xiao Cheng pondered for a moment and asked, ”President Wei, have you been very busy lately?“

Wei Zhen thought about the recent events, ”Not too busy, I suppose.“

He had delegated all the tasks that needed to be done, the new building of the film department was nearly finished,


Chapter 37:
Xiao Yindi nodded, ”If it's just one person, it would be too boring.“

Liu Xiaomai, who was working like a dog in the Weicheng Film Department: …

I hope you could pay more attention to your poor agent.

However, President Wei and Xiao Yindi had forgotten about Liu Xiaomai's existence.

Due to his preference for being a shut-in apart from necessary work, Wei Zhiren was not enthusiastic about traveling.

Every time Wei Mu wanted to drag Wei Zhiren out, Mr. President would instantly transform into a bed-bound slime, soft and unmovable, refusing to budge.

But going on a trip with the god he admired…

It sounded like a honeymoon for two.

Wei Zhiren bit his chopsticks, his mind in intense turmoil.

Xiao Cheng did not feel that Wei Zhiren would refuse him.

So, while eating stir-fried meat slices, he slowly started to outline his travel plans.

During the winter in China, one should go to a tropical seaside to escape the cold.

Sunbathing, surfing, skydiving, hang gliding…

Wei Zhiren listened attentively, his mind racing at the thought of seeing the god's physique up close at the beach, making his struggle even more intense.

Xiao Cheng had meticulously detailed his travel plans over the past two days, clearly showing his preparedness.

Mr. President looked at Xiao Yindi, who was eagerly awaiting his response after finishing the plan, hesitated for a moment, and then made up his mind.

Let's do it!

It's just a trip!

At home, I'm still licking the god, so why not go on a trip with him!

Let's make the plans!

Worst comes to worst, I'll die!

Wei Ziming watched his clumsy brother packing his luggage, feeling a complex mix of emotions.

He remembered the last time they went on a long trip together, when Wei Zhiren was in his sophomore summer vacation.

He had sneaked Wei Zhiren onto the plane while he was asleep.

What had happened then?

Oh, when Wei Zhiren woke up, he was bewildered, but at least knew not to cause a commotion in public. So, he endured for over ten hours on the plane, crying like a puppy in the car once they landed across the ocean.

While crying, he also launched small punches at his dear big brother.

Although Wei Zhiren had been ecstatic about the trip after that, Wei Ziming, who felt guilty, had run behind his brother like a beaten dog.

Those were painful memories.

Especially with the present comparison.

”Why are you rushing?“ Wei Ziming, who rarely offered to help his brother pack, stood at Wei Zhiren's bedroom door, saying with a bitter tone, ”You're leaving; I'll be alone at home.“

These words sounded profoundly sorrowful.

Wei Zhiren was carefully selecting the underwear he would take; it was a man's face! (Note: This is a colloquial expression in Chinese, meaning it's important.)

Little True turned to his brother, making a determined gesture with his fists, ”Brother Ming, you must be strong! You're a lone wolf!“

”I'll always watch over you from above, Brother!“

Wei Ziming: ”…“

Have you recently watched some weird anime?

”Why did Xiao Cheng suddenly invite you?“ Wei Ziming felt something was off, ”There's no reason for him to invite you; you're so busy…“

”I believe in Wang Tezhu's ability!“ Wei Zhiren, seemingly absent-minded, blabbered, ”I believe that after losing me, the president, the employees of Weicheng can still be strong under Wang Tezhu's leadership!“

”Because, Wang Tezhu is going to become the president!“

Wei Ziming: ”…“

I suspect that little brother might have rewatched Naruto recently.

”I suspect Xiao Cheng has some hidden intentions toward you,“ Brother Ming, with his sharp business acumen and piercing eyes, pointed out the dirty trick lurking in Xiao Yindi's heart.

He met his brother's gaze, ”The truth is simple—he wants to seduce you!“

Little True completely ignored his brother's words.

He listened with no change in expression, even feeling a bit amused.

So, he honestly laughed, ”Huhu, huhu, huhu, huhu!“

Mr. President happily shook his tail, ”Coincidentally, I want to seduce him too!“

Wei Ziming: ”…“

I can't respond to that.

Little brother is about to be seduced again.

Brother Ming watched his brother's cheerful expression, feeling somewhat tired.

He felt he needed to go on a date to avoid being force-fed more dog food by his brother.

Without him as a director, Bluestar would likely continue to thrive under the leadership of other directors.

Brother Ming felt it was likely and was itching to stir things up.

Little True interrupted Brother Ming's plans.

He held a black-bordered gray polyester underwear in his left hand and a pure white cotton underwear with only a black logo in his right hand, seriously asking his brother, ”Brother Ming, do you think Xiao Cheng is a polyester fan or a cotton fan?“

Wei Ziming did not want to speak and even considered beating his brother.

Brother Ming sighed, ”I think you should prepare a few swimsuits first.“

Wei Zhiren looked enlightened.

Then, a bit hesitantly, he said, ”But I don't have any.“

”Buy them!“

Wei Zhiren nodded, pulling out his phone, ready to call the omnipotent Wang Tezhu.

Wei Ziming: ”…“

I can't help but light a candle for Wang Tezhu.

Brother Ming could no longer control himself and entered his brother's room, ”Buy them yourself; don't bother Wang Tezhu. I'll help you pack.“

Wei Zhiren chuckled, ”Haha, I love my brother the most!“

Brother Ming, who was only called ’brother‘ in such situations, felt somewhat tired today.

However, Mr. President did not leave immediately.

He still held the two pairs of underwear, asking seriously, ”So, is Xiao Cheng a polyester fan or a cotton fan?“

Wei Ziming paused, turning to look at his brother.

A sinister smile spread across his face, ”I think normally, most men should be lace fans or情趣 fans.“

Little Brother Ming was hit by a heartwarming strike from his brother.

He remained silent for a long time, finally hesitantly saying, ”…But I don't have any.“

Wei Ziming looked incredulous.

You're actually planning to wear it, my brother?!

The dignity of a man?!

Wei Ziming looked at his cabbage brother and started seriously considering whether to eliminate Xiao Yindi.

Otherwise, he might one day see his brother running around the house in lace underwear.

Just thinking about it made him squint.

The author has something to say: Xiao Cheng: Whatever you wear, I like it :)

Wei Zhiren: Lace, lace?

Wei Ziming: …Sigh. [Headache.jpg]



Chapter 33

Wei Zhiren lay in the small compart

ment of the first-class cabin, holding his phone and chatting with his friends online after connecting to Wi-Fi.

The admirable and respectable big brother Wei Zhiren: Guys, let me tell you, Xiao Cheng is right next door to me now. Do you think he's asleep?

The admirable and respectable big brother Wei Zhiren: Should I do something strange while he's sleeping in the middle of the night?

Haishen: …Can't you change your group name three times a day?

The admirable and respectable big brother Wei Zhiren: No!

Haishen: Oh.

It's Your YiDa: Go for it, don't be a coward!

A Wasteful Dog: Go for it, don't be a coward!

Not a Single Good Thing About Europeans: Go for it, don't be a coward!

The Big Pants Next Door: Go for it, don't be a coward!

The admirable and respectable big brother Wei Zhiren: …No, I'm a coward!

It's Your YiDa: Pfft.

A Wasteful Dog: Ah Zhen, Dad really underestimated you.

The Big Pants Next Door: If you're not going to do it, sleep and do it in your dreams.

The admirable and respectable big brother Wei Zhiren: …No, that can't be the same!

The Big Pants Next Door: For a great magician like you, it's almost the same [roll eyes], anyway, you've never been in battle.

Wei Zhiren: ”…“

I can't even argue?!

A Wasteful Dog: Get some rest; you have to adjust to the time difference. Aren't you going to Hawaii to see Xiao Cheng's physique?

A Wasteful Zhen: Dog哥 is right! Dog哥 is right!

A Wasteful Zhen: Dog哥 understands me! I dedicate this couple's group name to you, my adorable Dog哥!


Chapter 38:
Mighty and formidable Dog Brother: ”Pah, who the hell wants to be in your couple's group name? Just looking at you makes me feel like I'm turning gaygay.“

One Wasteful True: ”…… QAQ“

Wei Zhiren felt wronged.

He placed his phone to the side, gazed for a while at the pitch-black night sky outside the window, and then stared at the moon on the horizon for a moment. After feeling satisfied, he pulled down the sunshade, thinking he would have to adjust to the time difference once they landed, and immediately fell asleep with his quilt in his arms.

Xiao Yingdi never thought that President Wei would have any intentions to attack him, after all, Wei Zhiren's courage was no bigger than a fingernail when facing him. Even in the middle of the night when everyone was deeply asleep, Wei Zhiren would surely cower in his quilt.

So, when he didn't receive a response from President Wei, Xiao Yingdi decided to take the initiative.

However, when he pushed open the door to President Wei's small compartment with the help of the flight attendant, he saw Wei Zhiren fast asleep with his quilt hugged tightly to his chest.

The quilt was rolled into a ball, his messy hair was disheveled, and even a small portion of his fair waist and belly was exposed.

Xiao Yingdi looked at the president sprawled out in bed for a long time, blinked, and couldn't help but take out his phone to secretly take several photos before exiting contentedly and quietly closing the door.

The flight they were on was a direct one, lasting nine hours.

Since it took off at one in the morning, Wei Zhiren slept soundly.

He only woke up slowly when Xiao Cheng reminded him that they were about to land, looking at the real Xiao Yingdi standing at the door, bewildered and confused.

Xiao Yingdi had hoped that the newly awakened president might come and cuddle him again, but Wei Zhiren didn't. Instead, he slowly widened his eyes in shock and held his quilt tightly, looking terrified.

”My my my my… my pillow has come to life!?“

Xiao Yingdi: ”……“

Oh, so you still have a pillow with my image on it.

Xiao Cheng couldn't help laughing and crying. He bent down to take the quilt from President Wei's arms, ”Change your clothes, we're almost there.“

The local time was four in the afternoon.

Wei Zhiren and Xiao Cheng each carried a suitcase, ready to go.

As they were about to step out of the VIP通道 and blend into the crowd, Wei Zhiren heard a scream.

Amidst the crowd of white faces and English speakers, a crisp and clear Chinese voice rang out, ”Xiao Cheng!?“

Xiao Yingdi instinctively reached for his sunglasses.

Finding nothing, he remembered that he had just put them on Wei Zhiren because Wei Zhiren seemed to have a tendency to get a sunstroke.

The intense sunlight of the tropical island made him sneeze uncontrollably.

His own sunglasses were at the bottom of the suitcase, and he couldn't retrieve them in a hurry, so Xiao Cheng directly handed his to Wei Zhiren.

Thinking he had crossed an ocean and the itinerary hadn't been leaked, he wouldn't meet many fans who recognized him—only to be proven wrong unexpectedly.

Xiao Cheng glanced at Wei Zhiren, who was rubbing his nose, and Wei Zhiren looked back at Xiao Yingdi through the sunglasses.

Xiao Yingdi already had his standard public relations smile on, leading the excited fans to the side to avoid disturbing others from leaving.

Wei Zhiren followed behind, dragging his suitcase, watching as Xiao Yingdi signed autographs and took photos with a dozen young girls, even chatting a bit.

The girls were all international students, enjoying their Christmas break, and working part-time as tour guides for tourists visiting from China. They hadn't expected to meet Xiao Cheng, such a huge surprise.

Wei Zhiren glanced at the sunlight outside the airport, although he was reluctant to take off Xiao Cheng's sunglasses, he had to reluctantly remove them and hand them over.

… He wanted to sneeze again.

Xiao Cheng took the sunglasses, looking at Wei Zhiren, who was vigorously rubbing his nose, somewhat worried.

Wei Zhiren waved his hand, indicating he was fine.

One of the girls looked at Wei Zhiren and whispered to Xiao Cheng, ”Where's Little Wheat?“

Xiao Yingdi was signing for another girl, head bowed, ”I came out on vacation secretly without him.“

After finishing, he looked at Wei Zhiren again, slightly tilting his chin, ”This is my friend, I had to drag him along.“

Wei Zhiren paused his nose-rubbing, slightly turning his head away behind his hand, mumbled vaguely, ”I was about to agree anyway.“

Xiao Yingdi just smiled, finished signing for the girls, put on his sunglasses, and got into the taxi with Wei Zhiren.

Wei Zhiren had a villa in Hawaii.

After telling the driver the address, President Wei turned to look at Xiao Yingdi, who was waving goodbye to the fans.

”You're itinerary will be leaked again,“ Wei Zhiren said in a rather listless tone.

If it weren't for this condition, Xiao Cheng wouldn't have taken the chance to give him his sunglasses.

Xiao Yingdi was used to it, ”I'm already used to it, and even with sunglasses, I can still be recognized.“

Wei Zhiren, thinking about how Xiao Yingdi recognized him even when he was fully dressed, fell into silence.

Xiao Cheng looked at the silent President Wei, ”It's okay if it's leaked, we won't go to crowded places anyway.“

Wei Zhiren: ”……“

It sounds like we're going to do something bizarre!

We're just going on a regular vacation!

They arrived at their destination after about forty minutes in the car.

Brother Ming had already arranged for the villa to be cleaned the day before, so they could move in immediately.

The villa was located in the row closest to the sea in the villa complex. Opening the window revealed a stretch of soft sandy beach, which was the private beach of the villa complex.

Exiting through the back door, crossing the flower garden below, they could directly enjoy the waves.

A row of beach chairs was set up on the beach, with only a few people around. There were places to rent surfboards and other entertainment equipment further away, and a seaside outdoor restaurant along the coastline.

Wei Zhiren chose a room facing the sea.

Xiao Yingdi looked at the room President Wei chose, thought for a moment, and directly entered the adjacent room.

Wei Zhiren opened his suitcase, with no intention of unpacking, quickly took off his cool shorts and pants, stripped down, and pulled out swimming trunks from the suitcase, putting them on.

Just as he finished, he heard someone knocking on the glass door on the balcony.

President Wei turned to see Xiao Yingdi, who was wearing a clean shirt and shorts, smiling on the balcony, having watched for quite some time.

Wei Zhiren: ”……“

F*ck!

Help!

How should I ask if the godly man saw my little d*ck?

So embarrassing… QAQ

Wei Zhiren looked at Xiao Cheng knocking on the glass door again, opening the balcony door stiffly.

Xiao Yingdi walked in, showing no signs of abnormality, ”I just discovered that the balconies of the two rooms are connected, quite romantic.“

Wei Zhiren: ”……“

Oh.

Don't stop me, I want to kill that romantic designer!

”President Wei, are you ready to play directly?“ Xiao Cheng observed President Wei, who was wearing only swimming trunks.

Wei Zhiren couldn't help wanting to push his glasses, but realizing he wasn't wearing any, he nodded dryly.

Xiao Yingdi thought for a moment, looked at the time, which was five in the afternoon.

”Alright, I'll go too. After playing, I can come back in the evening to adjust to the time difference.“ After speaking, Xiao Yingdi couldn't help glancing at Wei Zhiren again, ”President Wei, you don't usually exercise?“

Wei Zhiren held his breath for a while before finally letting out a nasal sound, ”… Mhm.“

Xiao Cheng wanted to say he had eight-pack abs, but thought Wei Zhiren would already know.

Unable to show off, Xiao Yingdi could only reluctantly return to his room to change into his swimming trunks.

Would the shy President Wei wait for the godly man who might have seen him naked?

He wouldn't!

Wei Zhiren put on a beach jacket, grabbed the keys and phone, and ran out of the villa.

When Xiao Cheng re-entered Wei Zhiren's room through the balcony, he only saw a string of keys on the bed.

…

Wei Zhiren was lost in thought at the place renting entertainment equipment.

The president, who didn't particularly like going to the beach, was completely clueless about these tools.

The owner next to him was still recommending, holding a surfboard, explaining that this was the best for beginners.


Chapter 39:
Emperor Xiao Yingdi finally caught up with President Wei. After listening to his boss's recommendations for a while, he nodded, ”I can teach President Wei.“

Wei Zhiren looked up at Emperor Xiao Yingdi, who stood behind him, pondering that he could not possibly just lie in the beach chair, a mere fish, being blown dry by the sea breeze.

Thus, President Wei simply rented the surfboard and eagerly followed Emperor Xiao Yingdi, who carried his own board, towards the vast blue sea.

Xiao Cheng carefully selected a gentle wave area and repeatedly tried it before finally bringing Wei Zhiren into the water.

Wei Zhiren had a strong learning ability, especially under Xiao Cheng's guidance, making him very happy.

In such a situation, his mischievous child nature emerged. President Wei, with his inexplicable confidence in himself, always tried to escape Coach Xiao and charge towards the waves on his own.

Emperor Xiao Yingdi felt that teaching President Wei for half an hour was more tiring than staying in the gym for three hours.

Thus, Emperor Xiao Yingdi suggested taking a break.

The energetic President Wei said he wanted to play by himself for a while.

Emperor Xiao Yingdi had already seen President Wei's dog paddle swimming technique, so he was quite at ease.

He went ashore and walked to the beach chair where they had placed their things, took out his phone, and snapped a selfie.

In the photo, Emperor Xiao Yingdi had a glass of juice beside him, wore sunglasses, his hair was wet, and water droplets clung to his face, giving him a hormone-laden, irresistibly handsome appearance. Not far away, President Wei was flipped over by a wave, looking terrified as he held the surfboard, with seaweed still hanging from his head.

When Emperor Xiao Yingdi saw this photo, he paused, ready to post it on Weibo, but when he turned to look at President Wei, the latter had already climbed back onto the surfboard, lying on the sand like a dying fish, gasping for air.

Emperor Xiao Yingdi: ”……“

Emperor Xiao Yingdi thought of Wei Zhiren as the gasping dried fish he used as his QQ profile picture.

… Sigh, headache.

Emperor Xiao Yingdi watched Wei Zhiren roll several times on the sand until, covered in sand, President Wei finally regained his energy, grabbed the surfboard, and charged at the waves again. Xiao Cheng slowly retracted his gaze, pretending not to have noticed, and with an indescribable secret motive, posted the photo with Wei Zhiren on Weibo.

Xiao Cheng: Having a holiday with a friend [smiling face][image]



He continued to enthusiastically paddle with the surfboard, firmly believing that next time he would walk on the waves with unmatched coolness.

However, reality was cruel.

Emperor Xiao Yingdi rested for about twenty minutes beside him. Every time he looked up, he saw President Wei hanging on the surfboard like a dried fish, still as wilted as a frostbitten little cabbage when facing the gentle waves, wilting with each wave.

Forget standing on the surfboard; it was hard for him to even climb onto it.

Emperor Xiao Yingdi watched for a while until President Wei finally gave up on further struggling and ran to the sand to catch crabs, a stern expression on his face. Only then did Emperor Xiao Yingdi retract his gaze and browse Weibo.

Wǒ Chēng Měi Rú Huà: Ah, ah, ah! It's been so long since I've seen your b̶o̶d̶y̶! Eh, wait, what's that strange thing in the background of the photo?!!

Wǒ Chēng Tiān Shàng Yán: The focus was on me, Chēng, so the background is a bit blurry… Taking a closer look, it's a person, a rather handsome young man.

Chēng Chēng de Xiǎo Dùn Yī: He just looks a bit fierce, phew, there's even seaweed hanging from his head…? He's kind of cute_(:з」∠)_

Xiao Cheng read this comment and agreed with it deeply.

He thought for a moment and replied to this oddly named fan.

Xiao Cheng: @Chēng Chēng de Xiǎo Dùn Yī That's my friend :)

Chēng Chēng de Xiǎo Dùn Yī: @Xiao Cheng You've made me flip my cards! [eyes wide open.jpg] Why does your friend look like a foolish son of a landlord?!

A foolish son of a landlord?

Xiao Cheng raised his head and looked at Wei Zhiren, who had thrown the surfboard aside and was catching crabs with great focus, and found it surprisingly natural.

… Anyway, Wei Zhiren's image as a president was already ruined when he was flipped over by the waves.

Xiao Cheng replied with a smiling face to this small fan.

It felt quite subtle.

He hoped President Wei wouldn't collapse when he realized the photo.

When Xiao Cheng was about to get up and join Wei Zhiren in playing, President Wei finally felt cold standing on the beach in his tiny swimming trunks, being blown by the sea breeze.

He grabbed a crab with his left hand, held the surfboard with his right, and approached Xiao Cheng, water droplets still on his face.

Xiao Cheng looked at Wei Zhiren holding a crab and then at the crab waving its claws in his hand. After a while, he asked President Wei, who had put on a beach jacket, ”President Wei, are you hungry for crab?“

President Wei looked at the crab he held, still in the jacket, and placed it on the table beside the beach chair, ”Not really hungry.“

Xiao Cheng handed him his drink, which he hadn't touched.

After being soaked in seawater for so long, Wei Zhiren felt like his body was drying up and desperately wanted to replenish some water.

However, he looked at the drink for a while, confirming that it hadn't been touched, and received it with a calm face, feeling a deep sense of disappointment.

He had thought a small flirtation might happen.

Like indirectly… Oh my, embarrassed=v=.

Xiao Cheng watched Wei Zhiren, who completely failed to realize his image was shattered and instantly switched to being a domineering president, and couldn't help but marvel at how steady President Wei's mindset was.

Wei Zhiren quickly finished the drink, sighed in relief, and lay back on the beach chair, looking very comfortable.

When President Wei usually looked at Emperor Xiao Yingdi, he always wore strong fanboy glasses. In reality, Emperor Xiao Yingdi also saw President Wei with a soft glow.

For example, right now, Emperor Xiao Yingdi looked at President Wei lying comfortably on the beach chair with his eyes closed, his gaze moving from his face to the water droplets sliding down his Adam's apple, then following the curve of his Adam's apple to President Wei's flat abdomen and chest, which were revealed because he hadn't buttoned his jacket.

There was also his navel and the wet swimsuit clinging to his body.

As if blinded by the sunbeams pouring down, Xiao Cheng felt that this body was extremely beautiful.

— For most Asian men, a half-clothed, teasing appearance is more alluring than being completely naked.

Especially when wet.

Emperor Xiao Yingdi propped his chin in his hand and, with his keen eyesight, estimated President Wei's measurements.

Mm, not as good as his.

Actually, before Emperor Xiao Yingdi knocked on the balcony door, he did catch a glimpse of Wei Zhiren changing into swimming trunks, but unfortunately, he didn't see the front or even the side—Wei Zhiren changed in the balcony facing away, and Emperor Xiao Yingdi only saw two fair buttocks.

Of course, this was an accident.

Emperor Xiao Yingdi and President Wei didn't know that the balconies of these two rooms were actually connected.

Lying on the beach chair in wet swimsuits wasn't very comfortable, so Wei Zhiren shifted uncomfortably and finally stood up with a frown under Emperor Xiao Yingdi's gaze.

Xiao Cheng glanced at the empty drink and asked, ”President Wei, are you done playing?“

Wei Zhiren looked at the surfboard beside him and said calmly, ”Surfing isn't something that can be learned in a short time.“

Emperor Xiao Yingdi smiled, ”Then let's play something else.“

He paused for a moment and added, ”Something that doesn't require learning.“

Emperor Xiao Yingdi had fully felt President Wei's inexplicable confidence in himself.

Xiao Cheng asked himself if he wasn't a professional coach, who would he find to compensate for such a good match if something happened to President Wei?

”Sure!“

Going on dates without dating isn't what a man does!

Wei Zhiren could accept any activity to play with Xiao Cheng.

At the same time, he was quite impressed with his own growth, not feeling nervous at all when in close contact with Xiao Cheng!

— Actually, thinking about it, being in close contact was not as nerve-wracking as being seen by Xiao Cheng without clothes on.

Wei Zhiren guessed that he was probably seen changing pants by Xiao Cheng, but the handsome man didn't mention it to avoid embarrassing him.

Wei Zhiren felt desperate and had already given up.

President Wei picked up his surfboard, returned it to the man, and immediately went to the dock to rent a two-person speedboat.

After enjoying the waves, he went diving while it was still light.

In the end, he stood on a hot air balloon, watching the sunset slowly disappear on the horizon.


Chapter 40:
When Wei Zhiren followed Xiao Cheng down from the hot air balloon, he was still in a state of excitement—how could he not be after such an intense series of recreational activities?

Xiao Cheng looked at President Wei, whose face was rosy and eyes shining, and throughout the observation, he found that except for the moment when Wei was flipped over by the waves while surfing, Wei had truly maintained his aloof demeanor. Xiao Cheng could not help but feel a bit of regret.

—But it didn't matter, there was still bungee jumping tomorrow.

Emperor Shadow did not believe in fate. He felt that this vacation would certainly allow President Sir to let his guard down in front of him.

Although the aloof and domineering president had his own charm, it was the lively and energetic little fanboy that Emperor Shadow truly favored.

Every time he chatted with Wei Zhiren under an assumed identity, Xiao Cheng could clearly feel the other's vitality and enthusiasm, which he could not sense when Wei Zhiren was striving to maintain his image as a president.

Xiao Cheng had seen many stern-faced, well-dressed businessmen and investors, so he especially cherished and appreciated Wei Zhiren's distinctiveness and liveliness.

Thinking of this, Emperor Shadow grabbed President Wei, who still wanted to go out for another round on the speedboat, saying, ”Go back and change your clothes; it's getting dark, and the sea breeze might make you catch a chill.“

Wei Zhiren hesitated for a moment but ultimately nodded and obediently followed Emperor Shadow back to the villa.

This time, he learned his lesson. The first thing he did after entering his room was to pull down the curtains and then take his clothes to take a shower.

Hearing the noise, Emperor Shadow walked to the balcony and looked at the room next door. He felt a bit of regret seeing it obscured by the curtains.

He lowered his head to look at the deck of cards in his hand, hesitated for a while, and ultimately gave up on the plan to use card games to strengthen their bond.

—He had already decided: draw a joker card, and the one who lost would play truth or dare.

Just thinking about it made him feel thrilled.

But it was too early.

He should go step by step, slowly, otherwise he might scare him away.

Thinking of this, Emperor Shadow put away the cards, glanced at the lights of the seaside restaurant in the distance, and returned to his room.

By the time both of them were ready, it was already nine o'clock at night.

Wei Zhiren was so hungry he was skin and bones, and he followed Xiao Cheng to the seaside restaurant for a hearty meal.

The decoration of the seaside restaurant was filled with tropical风情. While Xiao Cheng had the leisure to admire the decorations around the restaurant, Wei Zhiren would only bury his head in his food.

Emperor Shadow had not consumed much energy today, so he simply ate a bit casually and then leaned back to watch President Wei devour the prawns.

When President Wei's eating speed gradually slowed, Emperor Shadow glanced at the leftover dishes on the table, raising an eyebrow.

The plate of cod fillets was completely finished, while there were still leftovers of the other dishes.

Xiao Cheng stood up and went directly to the kitchen. After paying the bill to the owner, he bought two pieces of sliced cod meat and brought them back.

On the way back, Wei Zhiren was yawning slightly, and after returning to the villa, he was so tired that he did not even have time to look at his phone and fell asleep immediately, plunging into a deep slumber.

Emperor Shadow stood outside Wei Zhiren's room, feeling that President Sir's physical condition needed improvement.

Then, Mr. Emperor Shadow carried the two pieces of cod meat into the kitchen.

The next morning, Wei Zhiren came out of his room rubbing his eyes and wearing slippers after washing up, and he saw Emperor Shadow just bringing out two bowls of steaming porridge from the restaurant downstairs.

The porridge, simmered overnight, with cod meat mixed in, was fragrant and inviting.

Hearing the noise, Emperor Shadow set down the two bowls of porridge in his hand, raised his head slightly, and looked at Wei Zhiren, his eyebrows twitching, ”President Wei, good morning.“

Wei Zhiren felt for a moment that he might be dreaming—waking up to find that his idol had prepared breakfast for him and was even smiling at him with a side glance was a scene he had only seen in his dreams.

Thinking of this, President Wei pinched his thigh expressionlessly.

Then, he turned his head to avoid Xiao Cheng's line of sight, wincing in pain.

Cod porridge with a few slices of toast, and the company of his idol.

Wei Zhiren held the spoon in his mouth, staring at Emperor Shadow.

Emperor Shadow allowed him to look at him and even smiled at him sideways while sipping his porridge.

Wei Zhiren was stunned by that smile for a moment, stupidly taking the spoon out of his mouth, stirring the thick porridge, and still uncertainly touching his thigh, which he had pinched painfully just now.

”…It feels like I'm dreaming.“

Whether it was the seaside vacation, staying with Xiao Cheng, or being cared for by Xiao Cheng…

Everything felt like a dream.

Emperor Shadow paused slightly, and the spoon and bowl in his hand clinked together, making a clear sound.

He asked, ”Dreaming? What does President Wei mean by ’like dreaming‘?“

Wei Zhiren swallowed the porridge in his mouth and tore off a small piece of toast, pursing his lips, ”Since you were willing to sign a contract with me, everything feels like a dream.“

Xiao Cheng smiled but did not speak.

He thought to himself that if he dared to say it felt like a dream, Wei Zhiren would probably explode on the spot when he confessed his feelings.

”And…“

President Wei bit the toast, mumbling indistinctly.

”Waking up to a steaming delicious breakfast on the second morning of our vacation feels like a newly married couple on their honeymoon…“

When President Wei mentioned this, his action of tearing off toast suddenly froze.

Wait?

What did I just say!?

Wei Zhiren: …I might be dying; I hope my friends will burn paper for me next year.

Xiao Cheng: …What's the matter? Why are you dying? [Black Man Question Mark.jpg]



But before he could open his mouth, President Wei stood up, saying he was full and took the bowl to the kitchen.

Xiao Cheng: ”…“

In fact, he really thought that Wei Zhiren's words were fine.

Because Emperor Shadow himself felt the same way.

Unfortunately, before he could express his opinion, the bashful President Sir fled in a panic.

Emperor Shadow sat at the table, finishing his porridge quietly and listening to the sound of dishes being washed in the kitchen, feeling a bit regretful.

And Wei Zhiren, after washing the dishes quietly and coming out of the kitchen, tiptoed around the restaurant and sneaked back to his room.

Wei Zhiren felt a bit of collapse.

He threw himself onto the bed, rolled himself into a ball, reached out a hand to touch his phone, poked his head out from his ball, and opened WeChat.

President Sir wanted to find his friends to cry about his foolishness.

Although this was already a fact recognized by his friends, Wei Zhiren felt that he had once again shattered his previously assumed lower limit.

However, when Wei Zhiren took the opportunity to change his group nickname while his phone was loading and receiving messages, he found that there were many chat records in the group.

Wei Zhiren was stunned, wondering if his friends had made plans to go out and have fun while he was on vacation. Flipping through them, he found the screen filled with messages mocking him.

Wei Zhiren: ”…?“

You guys will really lose me!

Wei Zhiren had an incredulous look on his face as he scrolled through the chat records and finally found the source.

—it was a screenshot of a Weibo post.

Wei Zhiren looked at the screenshot for a while, then poked his head out from his ball and trembled as he opened Weibo.

Most of the time, whenever Xiao Cheng posted a Weibo, many fans would buy him the top headline, so when Wei Zhiren opened Weibo, the first thing he saw was Xiao Cheng's post from the afternoon of the previous day.

He tapped on the photo and looked at it for a long time, then pretended he had seen nothing and quietly closed Weibo.

Wei Zhiren hid his head back into the ball, feeling that his world was dark.

People in this world were cold-hearted, but at least the blanket still provided a little warmth.

President Sir, feeling wronged, twisted in the ball, completely unable to understand why the idol had posted that photo.

—In fact, the photo did not matter much to Wei Zhiren.

To Wei Zhiren, the most important thing was that he finally realized that his reliable president persona in front of the idol had completely collapsed.

Squish.

QAQ

Although the idol said he was happy his friend was happy when the photo was posted…

But…

President Sir was still very sad, deeply immersed in the shock of his persona exploding.

Wei Zhiren hid in the ball until he felt like he was suffocating, then re-emerged to take a breath of fresh air.

He decided to deceive himself and sleep, pretending he had not discovered the matter.

After waking up, he was once again a flaccid fish.


Chapter 41:
He could still maintain the image of a domineering CEO.

However, his fellow WeChat buddies did not intend to let him off the hook.

Sea Cucumber: @Today'sTrueIsAlsoStupid, get out here! I saw you change your group nickname!

Wei Zhiren glanced at his phone.

Get out!

I don't want to come out!

A Useless Dog: Hey, I can change it back.

Is Your Yide: Hahahaha, you finally showed up, True. How do you feel now? Red and fiery, dizzy and confused! Is it like when a girl sees her best friend taking a photo and only photoshops her own expression?

The Neighbor in Big Pants: Dazhi, if you keep this up, we really will cause trouble. Watch out, he might cry at your doorstep like he did when he was little.

Is Your Yide: I'm really scared! @Today'sTrueIsAlsoStupid, come out quickly! 23333

Wei Zhiren angrily picked up his phone!

Today'sTrueIsAlsoStupid: Unscientific! How did you recognize that expression as mine!?

A Useless Dog: Your face turned pale, but we've played with you since we were little; we'd never fail to recognize you!

Today'sTrueIsAlsoStupid: … [Crying with sorrow.jpg]

The buddies started another wave of intense mockery.

A Useless Dog: I thought you were already cowardly enough in front of Xiao Cheng, but I never expected you to be like this… Hey, True, even your dad is losing respect for you.

Wei Zhiren hid under the covers while tapping furiously on his phone.

Today'sTrueIsAlsoStupid: What's so funny!

Mr. CEO spoke while his heart was bleeding.

Today'sTrueIsAlsoStupid: I fully showcased Cheng's radiant beauty. This willingness to sacrifice my own image for my idol, you guys just don't understand!

Sea Cucumber: Alright, alright, I don't understand. You do. Did you seduce Xiao Cheng when you went out?

Today'sTrueIsAlsoStupid: [Come here, boy, I'll give you a buff.jpg]

Today'sTrueIsAlsoStupid: … Sorry, I didn't.

Today'sTrueIsAlsoStupid: But today, Xiao Cheng cooked for me! Cod Congee! Munch munch!

Sea Cucumber: Yeah, it's delicious. Anyway, your persona was already ruined after that photo yesterday, so be happy [Director Jin smiles.jpg]

Today'sTrueIsAlsoStupid: [I won't listen.jpg]

Wei Zhiren wanted to continue proving to his buddies that his relationship with Xiao Cheng had progressed, but he wasn't really concerned about his persona being ruined… Nonsense!

Wei Zhiren put down his phone and curled up under the covers, feeling utterly hopeless.

He desperately wanted to cry out loud.

Xiao Cheng stood on the balcony, looking at the ball of white bread that was the CEO under the covers, and knocked on the glass in front of him.

The thudding sound was clearly in the quiet room.

Wei Zhiren pulled back the covers, revealing half of his head, looking at the Celebrity Xiao standing outside.

Celebrity Xiao opened the door, ”I'm going to take a walk around town. Mr. Wei, do you want to come along?“

The CEO, whose emotions were in turmoil, flatly refused the invitation from his idol.

He watched Celebrity Xiao leave, feeling sad and wanting to cry.

When not working, Wei Zhiren was a complete shut-in. With a bed, a phone, and Wi-Fi, he could stay in bed all day.

But today, Wei Zhiren rarely wanted to stay in bed anymore.

Not long after Xiao Cheng left, Wei Zhiren changed his clothes and headed in the opposite direction from yesterday.

This private beach had a gentle and long coastline. Walking barefoot on the soft sand felt like stepping on a soft woven carpet.

The morning sun wasn't very strong, and the sea fog had just cleared. The sea breeze still carried a touch of the night's chill.

Wei Zhiren took off his shoes and ran towards where the waves were reaching, slowly walking along the coastline on the crest of the foam.

He felt he should find a way to divert his and Xiao Cheng's attention.

The CEO thought deeply as he walked. When he took another step, he felt something hard poking his foot.

Wei Zhiren stopped, moved his foot, and dug through the wet sand to find a complete seashell hidden beneath.

Wei Zhiren flipped over the palm-sized seashell, realizing it wasn't an empty shell but one that had lived. He silently threw the seashell back into the sea.

Then Wei Zhiren, aka Wei San sui, started happily collecting beach treasures.

—Of course, only the dead or broken ones.

He particularly liked those with bright colors and beautiful shapes.

Wei Zhiren collected a pile of shells, feeling his entire body permeated with the salty sea smell.

Wei San sui carried his bag of shells and seashells, bouncing back to the seaside restaurant from yesterday.

He asked the owner for a long, tropical bamboo rope, picked a spot, and chose the eight smoothest shells, taking out a small knife to start drilling.

The CEO seemed to have completely forgotten his ”it's too late to give handmade gifts to someone you like“ persona.

Wei San sui happily drilled the shells.

The restaurant was quiet early in the morning. The owner watched Wei Zhiren for a while, and after he finally drilled a small hole in one shell and tried to thread the bamboo rope through, he understood what the guest wanted to do.

Then, the owner told Wei Zhiren that they had tools for making shell crafts.

Wei San sui, who had struggled to drill a small hole and was now tired, said, ”…“

The owner taught Wei San sui how to make a beautiful little bracelet, and Wei Zhiren happily returned to the villa.

Xiao Cheng returned a bit earlier than Wei Zhiren. After searching the entire house for Wei Zhiren, he took out his phone to call Mr. Wei, only to see him walk in through the back door.

Celebrity Xiao paused, putting away his phone.

Wei Zhiren didn't expect to run into Xiao Cheng the moment he returned.

The CEO blinked lightly, walked to Celebrity Xiao, and handed him the shell bracelet.

”This is a token of gratitude for teaching me surfing,“ Mr. CEO said.

Xiao Cheng was startled, taking the bracelet. He could tell the knots were poorly made.

Celebrity Xiao smiled and asked, ”Made by you, Mr. Wei?“

Mr. CEO pursed his lips, feeling embarrassed.

He turned his head to avoid Celebrity Xiao's overly bright smile, coughed lightly, and nodded.

Xiao Cheng lowered his head to play with the bracelet, ”I'm honored.“

Although it had a strong sea smell, clearly from the beach.

It was still something made by Wei Zhiren himself.

Celebrity Xiao decided to treat the bracelet as an engagement token.

Though no engagement token was this ugly and smelly.

But Celebrity Xiao liked it, and Celebrity Xiao was whimsical.

Celebrity Xiao decided to go to a craft store that afternoon to have someone add a protective coating to the bracelet.

Wei Zhiren's handmade gift, Xiao Cheng believed, needed to be well-protected.

Not a single scratch allowed.

But before that, Xiao Cheng wanted to do one more thing.

”Mr. Wei, I saw a skydiving attraction nearby,“ Celebrity Xiao lied, as if he had just discovered it, ”Want to go for a ride?“

The CEO, who had surfed all morning and given Celebrity Xiao a gift, happily agreed to the invitation.

As if he had completely forgotten about Celebrity Xiao's photo.

But Wei Zhiren never expected.

Sitting in a sixty-story office for so many years without any discomfort, he suddenly felt dizzy standing at the helicopter door about to jump.

Wei Zhiren clung to the helicopter door, looking down at the tiny scenery, refusing a thousand times.

The cold wind blew fiercely, and the sound of the propellers roared in his ears.

Behind him stood the skydiving instructor, preparing their equipment.

Wei Zhiren was almost collapsing.

He wanted to cry out loud.

Oh my God, it's so high, so scary!

I don't want to jump!

The CEO froze at the helicopter door, turning to look at Celebrity Xiao, who was also cooperating with the instructor to put on his equipment, desperately wanting to ask if they shouldn't jump.

However, Celebrity Xiao looked enthusiastic, completely oblivious to Wei Zhiren's gaze.

It wasn't until the equipment was ready and the CEO clung to the door, that Xiao Cheng realized Wei Zhiren's fear of the matter.


Chapter 42:
He was taken aback, but quickly reacted, raising his voice: ”If you don't want to jump, that's fine…“

”No!“ Wei Zhenzhen did not wish to dampen Xiao Cheng's mood.

After all, he had agreed to come play together.

Under the gaze of his idol, President Wei, who would brave thorns and mountains for his god, released his grip on the helicopter door, took a deep breath, and, under the instructor's urging, mustered his courage and jumped.

Alongside President Wei's heroic parachute jump came a blood-curdling scream.

Wei Zhenzhen: ”AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA——!“

The shocked Xiao Yindi: ”……“

Oh, the character finally completely collapsed.

The author has something to say: Wei Zhenzhen: I am already a waste of true qi.

Xiao Cheng: Plan through :)))



The scenery of the tropical island was beautiful.

The sky was clear and blue.

Looking down, one could see the scattered buildings and lush forests on the island, the soft white sand curving along the coastline, the calm sea, and the occasional seagulls diving into the water, clutching struggling fish as they soared back up.

The colors of the near shore and the distance were clearly defined, transitioning from shallow to deep, with the horizon of the sea disappearing into a cold emerald green.

Occasionally, by changing angles and avoiding the glint of the sea's reflection, one could clearly see the coral reefs beneath the clear water.

With the help of the instructor behind him, Wei Zhenzhen landed on the beach, his legs feeling weak.

He sat down on the soft sand, turning his head to gaze at the endless ocean.

The scenery was beautiful.

After the initial icy wind, the air in mid-air, carrying the scent of the sea, was quite pleasant.

…It was just too damn hot.

Wei Zhenzhen, with the help of the instructor, took off his gear and looked up at Xiao Yindi, who was still floating in the sky.

A few minutes later, Xiao Yindi landed as well.

He walked to where Wei Zhenzhen was sitting on the sand, squatted down, and, seeing Wei Zhenzhen's slightly pale face, asked with concern: ”Are you alright, President Wei?“

”I'm fine!“ Wei Zhenzhen's heart was racing, his eyes shining, ”I want to play again!“

Such thrilling activities were really addictive!

President Wei was eager to try more.

Xiao Cheng, however, did not expect that Wei Zhenzhen, who had screamed blood-curdlingly when jumping, would want to play again.

Looking at the rosy hue spreading across President Wei's cheeks, Xiao Cheng finally could not resist and patted the president's head gently, saying in a mild tone: ”Not today, play again tomorrow.“

Wei Zhenzhen reluctantly turned his head to glance at the two instructors who were smiling at them, licked his lips, and finally nodded.

After the thrill, Xiao Cheng and Wei Zhenzhen chose milder activities like diving and sunbathing.

Wei Zhenzhen, still unsatisfied, rented a surfboard and relentlessly challenged the waves in the gentle area.

After jumping with a parachute, President Wei completely let go, smiling brightly every day and joyfully following Xiao Yindi around the island's attractions, even bouncing with every step he took.

Xiao Yindi, as if completely oblivious to President Wei's changes, continued to vary his activities with Wei Zhenzhen and pamper the president.

The two of them were extremely默契, and their interactions did not change at all.

—It had to be said that there was some change.

Wei Zhenzhen thought seriously and only felt that Xiao Yindi's smile was much brighter every day, and his tone always carried a charming tenderness.

It was their last night of vacation.

President Wei took advantage of the time when Xiao Yindi went out for a run after the sun set to borrow a barbecue grill from the seaside restaurant owner.

He set up the grill on the balcony, turned on the grill, and knocked on Xiao Yindi's balcony window.

Xiao Cheng had just returned home, turned on the light in the room, and heard the noise on the balcony.

Xiao Cheng raised an eyebrow and pulled back the curtains.

Wei Zhenzhen stood outside, pointing to the set-up grill.

Xiao Cheng laughed immediately.

He opened the balcony door and asked: ”Where are the ingredients?“

Wei Zhenzhen shook his tail, ”They're in the fridge, I'll go get them!“

Xiao Yindi watched President Wei dash to get the ingredients, looked at the gradually darkening sky, and brought a wall lamp from the room, extending the arm to place it beside the small table next to the grill.

Then, he went to the living room to find two folding chairs.

President Wei and Xiao Yindi, like a pair of performers, carried a chair and some ingredients, chatting aimlessly about trivial topics.

Wei Zhenzhen sat on one side, brushing oil on the ingredients and cutting the hefty chicken thigh into several pieces.

These few days living with Xiao Cheng, he had learned quite a few kitchen tricks.

Xiao Cheng unbuttoned the top two buttons, took the meat skewers that Wei Zhenzhen had oiled.

”Tomorrow we have to go back, Xiao Mai contacted me today and told me about some work.“

As he spoke, Xiao Cheng placed the meat skewers on the grill.

Then he smiled and said: ”President Wei really doesn't worry about tiring me.“

Director Xu's movies, ambassador for public welfare, and auditions for international films.

Xiao Cheng thought that he had long been accustomed to such a work schedule, but back when he was at Jing Ying, he did not directly shuttle between event venues and audition sites.

Back then, he had to work hard to secure resources. It was rare for a company to secure resources for him while he only needed to be present at the designated times.

”If you feel tired, you can decline some tasks,“ Wei Zhenzhen put the sliced chicken thigh aside, watching Xiao Cheng flip the meat skewers.

Xiao Yindi shook his head with a smile, saying he was just joking.

He placed the grilled meat skewers in front of Wei Zhenzhen's plate and reached for a vegetable skewer.

Wei Zhenzhen bit into the meat skewer, swaying his feet.

The evening sea breeze cooled the day's heat, feeling very refreshing.

Xiao Cheng and Wei Zhenzhen both enjoyed this peaceful and quiet time.

Of course, Xiao Cheng enjoyed the leisure, while Wei Zhenzhen, accustomed to staying at home, deeply appreciated this comfortable and unawkward atmosphere.

The ingredients on the grill emitted阵阵 fragrances.

Wei Zhenzhen watched Xiao Cheng's barbecue skills for a while before running to the kitchen to grab four bottles of beer.

By the time he returned with the beer, his bowl was piled high with grilled food.

Wei Zhenzhen placed the beer on the table, looking at the pitiful few meat skewers in Xiao Yindi's bowl, and took a large portion from his own.

”You don't need to take care of me so much, my exercise is much less than yours.“

Xiao Cheng glanced at Wei Zhenzhen, ”President Wei is younger than me, and so…“

He paused, slowly ate a meat skewer, and continued, ”and so adorable, taking care of you is as it should be.“

Wei Zhenzhen paused his chicken thigh, the oiled president licked his lips and wiped his mouth with a paper napkin.

He lowered his head in silence for a long time before heaving a heavy sigh.

He asked: ”Xiao Cheng, don't you think that…?“

Wei Zhenzhen weighed his words, ”Don't you think that… I'm not reliable? Not steady, jumping around and restless, like someone you can't depend on.“

”What does your personality have to do with your ability?“ Xiao Yindi answered without hesitation, ”No matter how your personality is, or how your appearance changes, your mind and the strength you possess will not disappear.“

Wei Zhenzhen: ”……“

No, that's not what I meant.

I'm just… afraid you won't like or accept me.

But after these few days, if Wei Zhenzhen still couldn't see that Xiao Cheng did not mind, he would be foolish.

Still, Wei Zhenzhen wanted to know how Xiao Cheng truly felt—after all, a normally aloof president suddenly becoming a silly and sweet little浪flower, it was normal for anyone to have some thoughts.

Xiao Yindi, flipping the ingredients on the grill, said: ”No matter how your personality is, haven't you helped me for so many years?“

”I won't think you're inappropriate just because your personality is more lively.“

President Wei, his hidden personality traits directly exposed, felt a bit embarrassed and quite shy.


Chapter 43:
He continued to silently munch on the chicken leg, saying nothing.

Xiao Cheng, however, broke the silence.

He placed the roasted shellfish into Wei Zhiren's bowl, his tone calm: ”I remember you.“

”I had seen you even before I made my debut in B City's film city—yes, I remember you, Wei Zhiren.“

For the first time, Emperor Xiao called the CEO by his full name.

Wei Zhiren's hand, holding the chicken leg, trembled. He turned his head to look at Xiao Cheng, his eyes wide with disbelief.

”I remember you. Back then, you would always hide in a small corner far away from the set, avoiding the cast, only occasionally speaking a few words to the staff.“

Emperor Xiao recalled calmly, ”During that period, the permanent staff at the film city knew you were my fan.“

”I also knew that you would go every day to ask the gate guards if I had a part that day.“

Wei Zhiren looked dumbfounded as Xiao Cheng detailed his former infatuation with him.

Emperor Xiao turned to look at the bewildered Wei Zhiren, a hint of confusion on his face: ”What I don't understand is, why did you always run away every time I tried to approach you?“

Wei Zhiren did not respond.

Xiao Cheng did not mind; he continued speaking to himself, ”In reality, I did not have much of a passion for the acting industry. To me, it was merely a career and a way to resist my family.“

”But when I saw you gaining popularity and fans, always watching me from the corner, I thought I couldn't let you down. So, I gritted my teeth and continued.“

Xiao Cheng finished speaking, falling silent for a moment before placing the roasted corn into Wei Zhiren's bowl.

He said, ”Wei Zhiren, your mother said I was your support, but to me, you were the one who initially supported me.“

”I indulged you, took care of you, and I did so willingly, feeling very happy about it.“

Wei Zhiren extended his greasy hand to grasp Xiao Cheng's, his voice weak: ”Stop….“

Xiao Cheng was taken aback.

”How could you have looked like that back then and like this now! How did you recognize me!“

Wei Zhiren was utterly devastated. The image of Emperor Xiao's earliest impression of him was that of a small, dark-skinned boy!

Had he been sold by his own mother all along?!

What about the supposed image of a domineering CEO?!

Emperor Xiao said that the dark-skinned boy was his initial support!

Heaven, how pitiful! Waaah!

Wei Zhiren looked at Xiao Cheng, ”Did your mother tell you these things?“

Emperor Xiao was silent for a moment before shaking his head: ”Not entirely.“

Wei Zhiren was shocked: ”What?“

Who?!

Was there someone else who betrayed him?!

Xiao Cheng fell into an eerie silence.

He stared at Wei Zhiren for a long while, pursing his lips in thought before finally deciding to confess everything at once.

Emperor Xiao averted his gaze and coughed lightly, ”My… my QQ nickname is…“

Wei Zhiren, seeing Xiao Cheng's guilty expression, felt a wave of foreboding.

Xiao Cheng licked his lips, ”…Little Black Monkey.“

Wei Zhiren: ”…“

?!?!?!?!

Excuse me? Hello?

What did Emperor Xiao just say?!

Was the wind too strong? I might have heard wrong.

Did he just say he was Doctor Monkey?!

Wei Zhiren looked at Xiao·Emperor·Doctor·Monkey·Cheng with his face in ruins.

H-help…

I might not see the sunrise tomorrow!

Who?!

Did anyone see my time machine?!

Emperor Xiao looked at the CEO's shattered expression, thought for a moment, and said, ”I always knew your personality wasn't very steady, and I didn't want you to always be tense in front of me, suppressing your emotions.“

”Besides, I must admit I'm not doing this for nothing, Wei Zhiren.“

Xiao Cheng looked at the moonlight, the gentle sea, the twinkling lights by the beach, and the white sand that seemed to glow under the moonlight.

Whether it was the scenery, the mood, the atmosphere, or Wei Zhiren, who was in shock and didn't run away shyly.

Emperor Xiao calculated the timing for his confession and decided to take advantage of the moment.

Thus, Xiao Cheng straightened his expression, ”I…“

A firework shot up from the nearby beach, blocking Emperor Xiao's words.

Wei Zhiren followed the sound and saw the spectacular fireworks bursting in the sky.

Emperor Xiao watched as the CEO, awakened by the fireworks, leaped straight over and joined the others in launching fireworks at the beach, taking a deep, deep sigh.

Maybe he shouldn't have calculated the timing before confessing.

Emperor Xiao decided to buy a calendar after returning home.

Author's Notes: Emperor Xiao: I might have miscalculated my fate.

Wei Zhiren: See you in the mortal world; I'm going to find the entrance to Mu Continent :)))



Wei Zhiren hid under the covers in the room, angrily tapping his phone.

Zhiren Zhiren: This is too much! You weren't like this before! You actually deceived me!

Zhiren Zhiren: [Crying in sorrow.jpg]

In the adjacent room, Xiao Cheng looked at the push notification on his phone and paused.

Little Black Monkey: At first… I didn't think so either.

Zhiren Zhiren: I'm cutting ties with you!

Xiao Cheng didn't even think about it.

Little Black Monkey: No way.

Wei Zhiren snorted.

Zhiren Zhiren: Three days! I'm cutting ties with you for three days!

Zhiren Zhiren: You can't talk to me for three days! Whatever you say, I won't hear!

Little Black Monkey: …

Wei Zhiren ignored Xiao Cheng from then on.

No matter how Emperor Xiao tapped him, whether via QQ, WeChat, or by knocking on his balcony window, he pretended not to see.

Even on the way back home, Wei Zhiren refused to speak to Xiao Cheng, not even exchanging a glance.

Emperor Xiao was helpless and had to honor Wei Zhiren's one-sided three-day break.

—It was like children arguing, saying they would never play with the other again.

Emperor Xiao couldn't help but laugh and cry.

There it was, the reason why he didn't dare get too close.

Saying it was a three-day break, who knew how long Wei Zhiren would hide.

Xiao Cheng sighed, looking at Wei Zhiren who was completely ignoring him, and finally put on his disguise again, pulling the scarf over his face, and left the airport with Wei Zhiren.

When they returned, Xiao Cheng's itinerary was no longer a secret.

To avoid any accidents, Liu Xiaomai had already rushed to Capital Airport to organize the fan reception.

Xiao Cheng was too low-profile in his daily life and rarely participated in fan interaction events.

Now, finally, they had a chance to interact closely, and many fans who were not in the capital had specially come to see Xiao Cheng.

After his carefree vacation, Emperor Xiao instantly returned to work mode upon entering China.

Wei Zhiren, pulling his luggage, finally turned to look at Xiao Cheng when he heard the ruckus of screams and saw the support banners held by the fans.

Xiao Cheng stood under the bright airport lights, surrounded by fans and security guards, countless cameras and flashlights pointed at him.

Xiao Cheng, realizing that the disguise was useless, removed his hat and mask, revealing his handsome face that everyone loved.

He calmly faced the cameras and excited fans, his face bearing a friendly smile as he was talking to a security guard beside him.

The security guard, who had been pushing the fans blocking the way, suddenly became gentle.

Wei Zhiren stood there quietly, watching.

Suddenly, Xiao Cheng seemed to sense his gaze and looked over, his bright, unmasked eyes locking with Wei Zhiren's.

Wei Zhiren was taken aback.

Xiao Cheng, through the many cameras and swaying crowd, faced Wei Zhiren and lightly raised his lips.

Wei Zhiren hastily withdrew his gaze and pulled his luggage, leaving the airport without a backward glance.

…

Wei Zhiren lay on the sofa like a catfish, his luggage sprawled open on the floor, and the specialties he brought for his brother on the table.

The CEO felt utterly despondent and had no idea how to handle Xiao Cheng's situation.


Chapter 44:
When Wei Ziming returned, the sky was already dark.

The room was pitch-black, with only the sofa emitting a faint, eerie light.

Wei Ziming turned on the light at the entrance and glanced at the shoe rack, only to see his younger brother's cushioned sneakers there as expected.

Little Ming Brother slowly changed his shoes, saying, ”Really? You came back and didn't turn on the light?“

Wei Zhen, who was flipping through his chat records with Xiao Heihouzi on his phone, moved slightly and grunted in response, then rolled over without flipping his body, continuing to lie on the sofa as if he were a corpse.

Mr. President looked at his chat records with his idol and was very tempted to find his missing time machine.

Wei Ziming walked to the edge of the sofa, staring at his corpse-like younger brother.

”What? Not having fun? Didn't you say you were happy before?“

Wei Yanyu waved his fish fins.

”Yes… I was happy.“ The fish looked utterly hopeless. ”But I discovered something terribly frightening.“

Wei Ziming sat on the sofa and pulled his fish brother up, saying, ”What happened? Tell me.“

Wei Zhen leaned against his brother like a rag doll, grunting, ”My character is ruined.“

Little Ming Brother nodded. ”Yeah, I know. Daizi told me.“

Wei Zhen: ”…“

Li Yadai, you can do it.

Wei Ziming asked, ”What else?“

”… Do you remember Xiao Heihouzi? I mentioned him many times.“ Wei Zhen's voice was muffled.

”I remember.“ Little Ming Brother thought for a moment. ”Is he the friend who gave you Xiao Cheng's photo album as a birthday gift? I think he must be quite close to Xiao Cheng, maybe a relative or an agent or something.“

Wei Zhen sighed.

Initially, he had also speculated. Someone who could frequently send him private photos of Xiao Cheng and even have a private photo album of his… Xiao Heihouzi might even be Liu Xiaomai.

But this speculation vanished the moment he saw Liu Xiaomai.

Because every time Liu Xiaomai saw him, she acted like a rat seeing a cat, wanting to avoid him at all costs.

Wei Zhen had many guesses about Xiao Heihouzi's identity.

But he never thought Xiao Heihouzi would be Xiao Cheng himself.

”Xiao Heihouzi is Xiao Cheng.“ After Wei Zhen said this, he curled up on the sofa, feeling like he was already a ruined person.

Whenever I think about all the indecent things I said to the monkey and shared many pictures of Xiao Cheng Photoshopped onto naked men… I feel…

Ah.

My world has collapsed.

Wei Zhen's entire demeanor turned dark.

Wei Ziming's face was full of surprise.

He never thought his younger brother had actually done something like Photoshopping Xiao Cheng into a naked man— he thought only black fans would do such things.

Little Ming Brother was silent for a while, then adjusted his expression, looking deeply pained.

”Zhen, I calculated with my fingers, Xiao Cheng probably wants to hook you.“

”He sent you a photo album with such significant meaning, invited you to dinner and vacation, was so enthusiastic and proactive, and came straight to Weicheng when you invited him— there's no way he's not up to something.“

Wei Zhen could not refute him.

Not only could he not refute him, he could only stammer, ”He also said he remembered me running to the film city every day when he hadn't debuted yet…“

”He even knew I would ask the guard every day if he had a scene that day!“

Mr. President was utterly devastated. ”What else doesn't he know about me!“

After hearing this, Wei Ziming lit a candle for his younger brother, Zhen.

”That makes it clearer. Because he knew it was you, he came to Weicheng, and because he knew it was always you, he developed feelings for you, and…“

Little Ming Brother looked at his devastated younger brother. ”I think you and Xiao Cheng are quite fated.“

Wei Zhen wailed, ”Then what should I do?“

Wei Ziming paused, then asked, ”Do you like Xiao Cheng?— I mean, like him as a lover.“

Wei Zhen nodded. ”Of course, how could I look at his poster if I didn't like him… Cough, cough.“

Little Ming Brother waved his big hand. ”Then you should be together.“

”He hasn't confessed yet, but…“ Wei Zhen was silent for a while before saying, ”I feel I don't deserve him.“

Wei Ziming was unhappy hearing this.

”What don't you deserve?“ he asked. ”You're richer than him, your family's influence is greater than his, you have such a cute personality, and you're not ugly either. What don't you deserve?“

”He's very good,“ Wei Zhen didn't know how to say it, so he could only say dryly, ”He's so good, how can I deserve him?“

Wei Ziming didn't understand this kind of feeling.

But seeing his brother's red eyes and low spirits, he felt like lashing out at Xiao Cheng.

His little brother Wei Zhen was such a confident and excellent person!

It's just that his personality is a bit eccentric.

How can you not deserve him, Xiao Cheng!

The brother who was venting his anger on Xiao Cheng looked at his brother for a while, then patted Wei Zhen's head. ”Then send Xiao Cheng a friend card.“

Wei Zhen was stunned. ”… Eh?“

Three days later, Xiao Cheng, who had been concerned about him, messaged Wei Zhen on time.

Xiao Heihouzi: Three days have passed.

Wei Zhen curled up in bed, feeling the vibration of the incoming message, and picked up his phone.

Zhenzhenzhen: …

Xiao Heihouzi: [Amiable smile.jpg]

Wei Zhen wished he could pretend not to see it.

He remembered Little Ming Brother's suggestion, but he didn't know how to send someone a friend card.

—Since college, Wei Zhen had never encountered anyone confessing to him.

Because he was obsessed with his studies and always had a cold face, and before college, he would directly reject people and say there was no possibility between them.

He didn't know how to cleverly send a friend card to his idol.

So Wei Zhen sought help from Baidu.

How to reject someone without hurting their feelings?

Wei Zhen flipped through the entries on Baidu, picked and chose, then synthesized them into one sentence.

Zhenzhenzhen: Monkey, you're a good monkey, let's continue being friends :)

The author has something to say: Wei Zhen: This is today's good monkey card and friend card, please accept it!

Xiao Cheng: …F*cking good monkey card.



Just as the Emperor was about to reply, Wei Zhen's side had new activity.

He withdrew a message.

Xiao Cheng: ”…“

The Emperor was a bit confused.

What was going on?

But Wei Zhen silently withdrew the message, then threw his phone aside and curled up in the blankets.

As if nothing had happened.

The sunlight outside was bright, but the curtains in Wei Zhen's room were drawn, making it very dim.

Wei Zhen hid in the blankets, not even revealing a hair.

Wei Zhen didn't know what to do.

He had previously said everything felt like a dream, a genuine and heartfelt thought.

Because Wei Zhen had never thought he could have such close contact with Xiao Cheng.

In Wei Zhen's heart, Xiao Cheng was a towering figure.

Wei Zhen had always been in a rather awkward situation.

He had an excellent older brother, and since he was young, everything revolved around his brother. Even at his birthday party, it was Wei Ziming who was surrounded and adored.

As if he couldn't be treated differently by anyone no matter what he did.

At that time, Wei Zhen started to think of giving up on himself and throwing in the towel.

After failing a minor exam and being beaten by his father, Wei Zhen decided to abandon himself and start hanging out with his current group of friends.

Wei Zhen didn't have any personality flaws; he was always rebellious, ran away from home, and skipped school, but he always held onto one bottom line. He seemed cowardly, but the main reason was a rather mundane one.

He wanted to get the attention and comfort he couldn't get in his daily life.

Wei Zhen wasn't a naturally bad person, so everything he did could only be considered minor misbehavior.

There were certain boundaries he was afraid to step over.

This state persisted from elementary school until senior high school for Wei Zhen.

In senior high school, Wei Zhen met Xiao Cheng.


Chapter 45:
At that time, Wei Zhiren could only feel that Xiao Cheng was truly handsome. Dressed in a neatly tailored military uniform, he stood with his shiny military boots gleaming. His waist was tightly cinched by a belt, and his military cap obscured his hair, giving him an air of nobility and pride, like a towering white poplar tree.

He was precisely the image of a military man that Wei Zhiren had in mind.

Wei Zhiren thus began to secretly observe Xiao Cheng.

He crouched in a small corner far away, watching Xiao Cheng work diligently.

At that time, Xiao Cheng was running around various film sets, playing minor roles off the radar. Despite being merely extras, he always acted with great seriousness.

When there were no scenes, he would not waste the pass to the film city that the production company had issued to him.

Wei Zhiren could often see Xiao Cheng rushing to other major film sets after his scenes were over, slipping in to help move props while the crew was busy. He would then pretend to be an assistant director, seamlessly staying behind and secretly hiding in inconspicuous corners to watch the actors perform.

At times, Wei Zhiren even saw Xiao Cheng boldly approaching some easy-going directors, carefully inquiring about something. Occasionally, he would even take out a notebook and take notes earnestly.

Among these directors, the one who provided the most guidance to Xiao Cheng was Xu Qingwen.

Xiao Cheng, immersed in his acting career, was very captivating. His diligent and upward-striving appearance was like a seed that was struggling to break through the darkness of the soil, about to sprout its green leaves.

Resilient and full of upward energy and enthusiasm.

Xiao Cheng's progress was remarkably evident—it was growing before everyone's eyes.

He gave everyone a huge surprise, including Wei Zhiren.

As well as Director Xu, who had always casually offered him some advice.

When Wei Zhiren learned that Director Xu had decided to cast Xiao Cheng as the third male lead in his new film, he thought about how he could help Xiao Cheng.

—Although Wei Zhiren's behavior leaned towards a dissolute lifestyle, he held the most profound respect and admiration for those who worked hard.

Just like how he would never harbor any bias against Wei Ziming, even if he was constantly compared to his brother.

Thinking about how he must do something for Xiao Cheng, Wei Zhiren pondered for a long time and went to Wei Ziming.

Wei Ziming casually suggested that he should earn the investment for Xiao Cheng through his own efforts.

At that moment, Wei Zhiren thought, if someone like Xiao Cheng, who had no background, could make progress step by step, why couldn't he?

Xiao Cheng demonstrated through his actions that as long as one put in effort, one could see progress and achieve results.

Although the initial progress might be minimal and hardly noticeable, with perseverance, one could eventually see results.

With this in mind, Wei Zhiren began to work hard.

After making a lot of people question his abilities, Wei Zhiren succeeded.

For Wei Zhiren, who had never tasted success before and was inspired by Xiao Cheng, Xiao Cheng was a beacon, a guiding light, and the pillar he could grasp when he wanted to give up in difficult times.

Why had Wei Zhiren never thought about getting close to Xiao Cheng in reality all these years?

It was because he had never placed Xiao Cheng on an equal footing with himself. To put it dramatically, in Wei Zhiren's heart, Xiao Cheng was a cloud in the sky that was unreachable, while he was a mud puddle looking up at the floating clouds beneath the blue sky.

Wei Zhiren genuinely believed that there would be little intersection between him and Xiao Cheng, so he told Wang Tezhu that there was no need to treat Xiao Cheng specially from the beginning.

—He simply did not believe that Xiao Cheng would seek him out.

Moreover, Wei Zhiren attributed Xiao Cheng's joining Weicheng to the business plan given to him by Wei Ziming.

Otherwise?

Otherwise, why would Xiao Cheng come to Weicheng?

Being able to be friends and be close to Xiao Cheng was already an unexpected surprise for Wei Zhiren.

Going further, Wei Zhiren had no idea how to handle himself.

Moreover, Xiao Cheng had clearly shown his importance and fondness towards him.

Wei Zhiren was not stupid, and his emotional intelligence was not low.

Xiao Cheng's actions, the messages conveyed by Little Black Monkey, and the words said during the barbecue all clearly indicated what was happening.

Wei Zhiren understood, but he was at a loss about how to deal with it.

Wei Zhiren buried himself in the blanket until he felt that even breathing was painful, before emerging.

He stared at his phone, which he had turned face down, hiding all the light.

After a while, he hesitated and picked up the phone.

Xiao Cheng's messages filled the entire screen.

Wei Zhiren unlocked the phone and slowly scrolled through Xiao Cheng's messages.

Little Black Monkey: Why did you delete it?
Little Black Monkey: Are you still angry?
Little Black Monkey: Sorry, I wanted to tell you after I knew it was you, but I was afraid you would be embarrassed and stop talking to me after learning the truth, so...
Little Black Monkey: Don't be angry.
Little Black Monkey: It was my fault. I shouldn't have kept it from you.
Little Black Monkey: President Wei? Wei Zhiren? Zhenzhen? Little Zhenzhen?
Little Black Monkey: Talk to me...
Little Black Monkey: ...You see, this is why I didn't want to tell you the truth before.
Little Black Monkey: The press conference is about to start, so I'm going now.
Little Black Monkey: If you still don't want to talk to me after the press conference, I'll have to take drastic measures, okay? :)

Wei Zhiren looked at the long string of messages and silently read the last few lines for a long time.

Drastic measures...

Wei Zhiren truly did not want to experience them.

Today was the day Xiao Cheng officially signed with Weicheng and publicly announced his contract with the company.

The person holding the press conference with Xiao Cheng was the head of the film department at Weicheng, a well-respected senior figure in the industry.

Wei Zhiren thought for a moment before getting out of bed and opening the live stream of the press conference.

Just as the video opened, Xiao Cheng was exchanging contracts with the head of the film department at Weicheng, signing his name, and simultaneously announcing his collaboration with Director Xu on his new film.

After that came the Q&A session, which Xiao Cheng handled very well.

Facing many aggressive and leading questions, the Emperor of Acting responded flawlessly, leaving the reporters with nothing and even subtly praising Weicheng.

Wei Zhiren watched the radiant Xiao Cheng for a long time before turning off the video and checking his Weibo.

Weibo was filled with enthusiastic announcements and some inquiries about what Weicheng was, but no one had managed to dig up any information yet.

The PR department had already informed the media and used the tiger skin of Lanting, making many media outlets willing to cooperate.

Apart from some fans expressing uncertainty about the new company, Weibo was mostly celebrating.

Wei Zhiren then entered Xiao Cheng's Weibo, where the latest update was the announcement of his joining Weicheng.

The post before that was still the vacation update.

Wei Zhiren stared blankly for a long time before the light outside gradually dimmed.

He hesitated for a long time before opening QQ.

ZhenzhenZhenzhen: I'm not angry.
ZhenzhenZhenzhen: I just feel... I lost Doctor Monkey [crying in sorrow.jpg].

Xiao Cheng's response came quickly, but it was about an unrelated topic.

Little Black Monkey: Are you at home?
Wei Zhiren was stunned.
ZhenzhenZhenzhen: Yes.
Little Black Monkey: Then open the door.
Wei Zhiren: ”...“
Mr. President looked at the screen in disbelief.
So it's not?
Wei Zhiren hurriedly put on his slippers and rushed to the door.
Mr. President opened the door, looking at the Emperor of Acting standing outside his home.
Wei Zhiren was even more incredulous.
Are you using a cliché from idol dramas that I thought you would find tacky?!
Xiao Cheng looked at Wei Zhiren in his pajamas.
”Because I didn't receive a response after the press conference, so I took drastic measures,“ the Emperor of Acting said.
Wei Zhiren pursed his lips without speaking.
The Emperor of Acting continued, ”There's something else I think I must clear up in person.“
Wei Zhiren, sensing something, interrupted Xiao Cheng, ”I'm not angry, I'm not angry, I won't be angry at you. After all, I've been friends with Monkey... I've been friends with you for so many years.“
Hearing this, Xiao Cheng fell silent for a long time.
It took the entire day for Xiao Cheng to understand the meaning behind Wei Zhiren's initial deletion of the message.


Chapter 46:
Clearly, President Wei had already detected his intentions, but he had no intention of accepting them.

Therefore, he had previously sent Wei Zhen a good monkey card and a friend card directly.

Since Wei Zhen did not accept, it was highly likely that Wei Zhen's feelings for him were limited to the adoration and affection of a fan toward an idol, thought Emperor Shadow.

After a while, he raised his eyes to look at Mr. President.

”The second friend card of the day.“

Mr. Emperor Shadow sighed lightly.

”Although it has been rejected even before it began, I still wish to express it to you face-to-face.“

Xiao Cheng asked seriously and solemnly, ”Can you give me a chance to pursue you, Wei Zhen?“

As soon as the words left his mouth, President Wei slammed the door shut in front of Emperor Shadow, almost hitting his perfectly straight nose.

Author's Note: Xiao Cheng: … You have changed, you weren't like this before, you used to love me so much.

Wei Zhen: I love you too now! [Cries in sorrow.jpg]



What did I just do?

Am I blind?

Am I deaf?

Did I just hear my idol say he wants to pursue me?

Wei Zhen leaned against the door, feeling the chill of winter seeping through the door panel. After a while, he raised his hand to forcefully rub his feverish face and turned around to look at the peephole.

Emperor Shadow was standing outside, still rather dazed as he rubbed his nose, looking extremely pitiful.

President Wei's heart was torn between reason and emotion.

After looking through the peephole for three seconds, he saw Emperor Shadow with his lips pursed, his expression looking rather sad.

Wei Zhen paused, took a deep breath, and reached out to press the door handle.

Xiao Cheng was momentarily stunned by the sudden closure of the door.

Although he had expected Wei Zhen to be shy, he never thought his reaction would be so strong.

Just as Emperor Shadow was lowering his head, preparing to call President Wei again to restate his intentions, the door that had just been slammed shut opened a small crack.

Half of Wei Zhen's face was peering through the crack, silently staring at him.

Xiao Cheng's movements paused.

Wei Zhen looked at Emperor Shadow as the crack gradually widened.

President Wei pursed his lips and asked, ”Do you want to come in for a cup of tea?“

A smile appeared on Emperor Shadow's face, ”I couldn't ask for anything better.“

Wei Zhen fetched a pair of cotton slippers for Xiao Cheng.

Xiao Cheng looked at the rabbit slippers, then at the bear slippers on Wei Zhen's feet, giving President Wei a look that was half-smile, half-skeptical.

Wei Zhen, feeling somewhat embarrassed, rubbed his nose, ”These are my backups.“

Emperor Shadow lightly responded, not at all bothered as he put on the slippers that completely contradicted his style.

Although he had invited Xiao Cheng to come in for a cup of tea, what ended up in front of Xiao Cheng was a freshly brewed black coffee.

Xiao Cheng glanced at Wei Zhen, who was rummaging through the cream powder, ”No need to look, President Wei.“

Hearing the title revert, Wei Zhen stopped his actions.

He straightened his body, closed the cabinet door, feeling both relieved and sad.

He turned his head to look at Xiao Cheng sitting in the living room.

Emperor Shadow was lowering his eyes, gently blowing on the scalding coffee, taking a shallow sip.

Then he lightly licked his lips, his tongue brushing over his beautifully shaped lips, leaving a slight sheen under the light.

Wei Zhen felt his head getting a bit hot.

He hastily shifted his gaze, forcefully patting his face, which had become warm.

Wei Zhen had not even had time to clean the coffee machine when he turned and ran to his room, muttering frantically, ”I-I'll go back to my room to tidy up!“

Xiao Cheng was taken aback, watching Wei Zhen shuffle upstairs in his slippers and into the room.

Emperor Shadow looked at President Wei's hasty retreat, utterly puzzled.

What did he just do?

Wei Zhen raced back to his room, looking at the posters of Xiao Cheng covering an entire wall, the life-size pillow of Xiao Cheng on his bed, and the glass cabinet filled with various figurines of Xiao Cheng in different roles, feeling like he had taken a pill.

Especially after realizing that Xiao Cheng had known about these for a long time…

Wei Zhen's heart was in turmoil.

He rushed to the computer, directly opening the chat window with Little Black Monkey without thinking, typing a string of words, and then suddenly realizing that his partner was downstairs.

… What should he do.

He could not even find an ally now.

Wei Zhen hugged his head, banging it against the table.

He could not control himself whenever he saw his idol looking so sad and lonely!

Wei Zhen lay on the computer table, desperately wanting to cry out loud.

In the end, after his idol came home, he only dared to hide in his room!

What should he do!

He felt so desperate!

Wei Zhen looked at the long message on the computer screen, hugged his head for a while, and then gritted his teeth, continuing to write regardless.

Xiao Cheng sat alone in Wei Zhen's living room, seriously contemplating whether to continue pressing on Wei Zhen's fragile nerves by knocking on his door or to end it for today and plot it out later.

But before he could reach a conclusion, his phone in the pocket of his coat vibrated.

Emperor Shadow took out the phone and saw the message from Wei Zhen.

Zhenzhenzhen: My monkey! I went on vacation with Xiao Cheng and had a wonderful time! He's particularly, particularly good to me! He takes such good care of me! But he said a lot of things and crazily took off his mask! [No Doggie Emotion.jpg]

Zhenzhenzhen: He's too good to me, I suspect he likes me!

Zhenzhenzhen: But then! He suddenly came to my house today and said he wants to pursue me!

Zhenzhenzhen: I think the idol might have drunk fake alcohol, ask me how to bring the idol who drank fake alcohol back home?

Xiao Cheng: ”…“

I didn't drink fake alcohol.

Emperor Shadow looked at the coffee on the coffee table, unable to resist taking another sip.

He continued to watch Wei Zhen spamming messages.

Zhenzhenzhen: Doctor Monkey, do you know what it feels like when someone who has always stood on a pedestal suddenly comes down and chats with you, plays with you, and hangs out with you?

Zhenzhenzhen: It terrified me! [Newbie Shivering.jpg]

When Xiao Cheng saw this, his expression was somewhat astonished. He had never expected his image in Wei Zhen's eyes to be so glorious and great.

Emperor Shadow clicked on the input bar.

Little Black Monkey: He never put himself on a pedestal; he's just an ordinary person.

Wei Zhen sat cross-legged on the chair, looking at Xiao Cheng's reply, his fingertips lightly tapping the keyboard.

Zhenzhenzhen: But, Xiao Cheng is like that to me.

Zhenzhenzhen: So, Doctor Monkey, what should I do when Xiao Cheng suddenly came to my house and said he wants to pursue me?

Zhenzhenzhen: I like Xiao Cheng.

Zhenzhenzhen: I like him a lot, just like my dad loves my mom.

Zhenzhenzhen: But I don't know what to do.

Zhenzhenzhen: If he's that good, what if he gets attacked because of his orientation? What if his family fights with him because of this? What if the media attacks him for the first time because of my problem?

Zhenzhenzhen: I don't have the ability to handle all of this yet, Doctor Monkey. I'm a bit


Chapter 47:
Wei Zhiren, after finishing that sentence, arranged his disheveled pajamas with a stern expression and put on his slippers before leaving the room.

Xiao Yingdi downstairs had already put away his phone, adopting an ”I know nothing“ demeanor, and held a cup of coffee, looking up at Mr. President with a smile.

That smile was almost enough to make flowers bloom around him.

For a brief moment, Wei Zhiren wanted to retreat back in fear.

But in order not to disappoint Doctor Monkey's expectations, he forced himself to walk to Xiao Cheng's side, hands and feet moving awkwardly, and sat down with impeccable posture.

The soft sofa almost enveloped him entirely.

Xiao Yingdi did not expose Mr. President's embarrassment; after Wei Zhiren sat down, he slightly reined in his smiling eyes.

Xiao Yingdi asked, ”President Wei, have you decided how to refuse me?“

Wei Zhiren pursed his lips and shook his head slightly, ”No.“

Xiao Cheng put down his coffee, sat up straight, and adopted a listening posture.

Mr. President remained silent for a long while, finally coughing lightly under Xiao Yingdi's gaze. He turned his head to avoid the other's gaze, then forcefully redirected his eyes back.

Wei Zhiren looked at Xiao Cheng's eyes, which were so close, and licked his dry lips.

Then he said dryly, ”Because I haven't figured out how to refuse you, so I decided to agree.“

The entire living room fell into silence.

After a while, Xiao Yingdi let out a long sigh, reached out to cup Mr. President's face, his forehead touching Wei Zhiren's, and the smile in his eyes almost melted into a stream.

”Not纠结 anymore?“ he asked.

Wei Zhiren lowered his eyes and faintly hummed, ”Thanks to Doctor Monkey's skilled medical treatment.“

”Of course.“

Xiao Cheng's voice was gentle and warm, trailing off with a hint of tender affection.

”I like you, and you happen to like me as well. Shouldn't we be together?“

Author's note: Wei Zhiren: [First to explode in respect.jpg]

Wei Ziming: I suspect you two haven't considered my feelings as his older brother at all!



Xiao Cheng's scent grew closer, carrying a faint aroma of coffee, lingering around his nostrils.

Mr. President's hands tightly gripped the soft pajama sleeves, sitting nervously on the sofa as if his soul had been stripped from his body, his mind blank and emotions uncontrollable.

He could only smell the bitter aroma of the coffee, clutching the pajama sleeves like a lifeline, his brain desperately instructing his body to respond, but receiving no reply.

As if a century had passed.

Laughter of children could be heard faintly from outside the door, yanking Wei Zhiren's wandering soul back.

Mr. President shivered and came to his senses, dodging Xiao Yingdi's hands, moving backward, and grabbing a pillow beside him, holding it in front of him, blocking the two of them.

Wei Zhiren, almost kissed, was flushed red, his eyes brimming with tears from excessive tension. He sniffled and stammered, ”I-I-I just said I would give you a chance to pursue me! You-you-you better not do anything crazy!“

Xiao Yingdi, whose sneak attack failed, sighed and lowered his hands, looking at President Wei who was almost squeezing the pillow to pieces, his smile unchanged.

”Thank you, President Wei, for giving me this chance.“

Wei Zhiren pouted and said softly, ”Don't call me President Wei.“

Xiao Yingdi, with his sharp ears, nodded, his voice gentle as a breeze caressing the tip of a heart.

”You should call me Zhiren.“ After that, Xiao Yingdi rested his chin in his palm and looked at Mr. President, ”And you?“

Wei Zhiren paused, looking at Xiao Cheng with a blank expression, then said uncertainly after a while, ”Doctor… Monkey?“

Xiao Cheng: ”…“

Are you serious?

Wei Zhiren looked at the silent Xiao Yingdi and defended himself, ”I, I think it's good!“

Xiao Cheng sighed and nodded, ”Mm, if you like it.“

Wei Zhiren looked at Xiao Cheng's exasperated yet indulgent expression, blinked, and boldly leaned in a bit, asking, ”Doctor Monkey, how did you find me so appealing?“

”What do you mean by ’so appealing‘?“ Xiao Cheng seemed even more exasperated, ”You're good. Don't always belittle yourself.“

Wei Zhiren couldn't help but raise his hand to rub his face, which was starting to heat up again.

Xiao Cheng looked at Wei Zhiren's bashful appearance, pondering for a long time, then asked, ”Does President Wei remember that summer vacation a decade ago when you ran away from home and slept on a bridge?“

Wei Zhiren: ”…“

What?

How did you know all this!

Wei Zhiren was shocked.

”In fact, I often ran away from home. When I couldn't find anyone to take me in and didn't have any money, I would often sleep on the bridge,“ Wei Zhiren said, holding the pillow somewhat awkwardly, ”Which incident are you referring to…?“

Xiao Yingdi was completely unprepared for such an answer.

He remained silent for a long time, the duration making Wei Zhiren feel a bit anxious, before he spoke, ”Do you remember the time you brought someone else to sleep on the bridge?“

Wei Zhiren was completely bewildered.

Xiao Yingdi sighed softly.

It seems he doesn't remember.

But it's not surprising, for him, memorable events might be just casually helping a homeless person for Wei Zhiren.

”In fact, I first saw you ten years ago—now eleven years ago.“

Xiao Cheng said, looking at the wide-eyed President Wei, and took a sip of his warm coffee.

Wei Zhiren listened as Xiao Cheng recounted how he encountered Wei Zhiren during a run away, how he was about to return home in hunger, ready to beg his fiancée for forgiveness, but was saved by a bowl of instant noodles, and then dragged to spend the night on the bridge.

Wei Zhiren's heart was crushed.

I actually slept with my idol before!

No!

I actually dragged my idol to sleep on the bridge for a night!

Mr. President felt his dark history could never be washed away, truly crushing.

”That morning you left, you left me a small bag of change, telling me to go home early and said with a smile, ’You can't go to the construction site to carry bricks, right?‘“ Xiao Yingdi sipped his coffee slowly, ”At that moment, I thought, why not? It's better than going home.“

Wei Zhiren suddenly recalled an interview where he asked Xiao Cheng how he became an actor. Xiao Cheng had half-jokingly answered that carrying bricks was too tiring, and coincidentally, Xiao Xiaomai dug him out of the construction site, so he changed jobs.

Wei Zhiren: ”…“

Don't tell me that metaphorical statement was true…

However, Xiao Cheng's next sentence shattered Wei Zhiren's escape fantasy.

He said, ”So I went to the construction site near the bridge to carry bricks.“

Wei Zhiren: ”…“

My idol, I'm sorry.

Really, I'm sorry.

Wei Zhiren was filled with remorse.

”You asked my name when you left,“ Xiao Cheng smiled at the collapsing Mr. President, ”You said you were a red scarf.“

Wei Zhiren: ”…“

What the hell is a red scarf.

But this was indeed something this little one would say.

Wei Zhiren hugged the pillow, wanting to hide behind it.

I'm just a salted fish that shouts 666, why did my past self do such things!

”Originally, I didn't plan to look for you again—I considered that incident as…“ Xiao Cheng paused, ”a small stroke of fate.“

”Who knew you would appear in front of me again.“ Xiao Yingdi thought of the surprise of seeing the little black puppy again, a radiant smile spreading across his face, ”I thought, since we have such fate, I should repay you for the help. Who knew every time I went to your side, you would run away.“

In fact, Xiao Cheng had chased after Wei Zhiren several times, calling him ”red scarf,“ but Wei Zhiren didn't realize he was being called, always running away headfirst.

Xiao Cheng had even asked the staff to inform Wei Zhiren that he had something to talk about, but Wei Zhiren still didn't listen, running away whenever he approached.

He wouldn't even leave his name, only knowing that those who could easily enter the film city were either too rich or had connections with the staff inside.

What could Xiao Cheng do? He was also desperate.


Chapter 48:
”Later, I had been constantly trying to find you. I took a photograph of you from afar, but due to its extreme blurriness, it could not serve as a very strong clue. Therefore, it was only until half a year ago, when I met your mother, who showed me your old photographs, that I finally found you. I felt that even the heavens were saying we should be together.“

Emperor Xiaoying felt that finding a person was truly quite difficult.

Even more difficult was that Wei Zhenzhen had always been close to him.

”Finally, when I had lost all hope, I found you. I believe that even the heavens are saying we should be together.“

Emperor Xiaoying looked at the ostrich CEO, who had involuntarily moved a little further away, and said, ”So, I will not give up.“

The atmosphere instantly became sweet and sticky.

The bitter aroma of coffee lingered for a long time, swirling around his nose like a sweet fragrance mixed with honey.

Wei Zhenzhen did not know what to say anymore.

He buried his head behind the pillow, searching for his time machine.

He had no recollection of what Xia Cheng had said, but this did not prevent Wei Zhenzhen from feeling regret—had he known he would encounter Xia Cheng then, he should have directly taken him home as a child bride!

Wei Zhenzhen thought angrily, squeezing the pillow in his arms, and lifting his head to look at Xia Cheng. After a while, he pointed to the kitchen, ”The housekeeper went home for the New Year. I am hungry.“

As soon as he finished speaking, the CEO's stomach made a timely growling sound.

Xia Cheng was not at all surprised to receive such a reply to his heartfelt confession.

—Actually, Wei Zhenzhen had not chased him away or retreated to his room after saying those words, which was already enough to surprise Xia Cheng.

—It was just a change of topic.

Emperor Xiaoying had long been accustomed to this.

Emperor Xiaoying did not mind at all. He put down his coffee and stood up, asking, ”Did you not have lunch?“

Wei Zhenzhen, hugging the pillow, looked at Emperor Xiaoying, who had taken off his coat and placed it on the back of the sofa, nodding without blinking.

Emperor Xiaoying paused in his action of rolling up his sleeves.

He raised his eyebrows, ”Did you not have breakfast?“

Wei Zhenzhen nodded again.

Emperor Xiaoying frowned and turned to open the refrigerator.

The CEO, hugging the soft pillow, thought that once Xia Cheng finished cooking, he would formally and seriously say: Since your cooking is particularly delicious, I agree to your pursuit.

Wei Zhenzhen thought about this, sitting up straight with the pillow in his arms, staring intently at the direction of the kitchen, vividly imagining the scene that was about to unfold, and calmly preparing his emotions—so that he would not stutter and lose his composure when Xia Cheng smiled.

Soon, there were sounds coming from the kitchen.

His brother did not answer the phone. When Xiao Ming found out that his brother had not gone to work that day, he opened the door, intending to find his dear brother to go out for dinner together. As soon as he entered, he smelled the bitter aroma of coffee wafting through the house.

The only person in the Wei family who loved coffee was Wei Zhenming.

Xiao Ming's gaze swept over the two pairs of men's shoes placed side by side at the entrance, one of which was clearly not in Wei Zhenzhen's style.

His gaze swept over the living room, seeing his brother's head poking out from the sofa.

There was a coat draped over the back of the sofa, a style Wei Zhenming had never seen in Wei Zhenzhen's wardrobe.

Xiao Ming's gaze then moved to the living room and the kitchen just beyond.

The light and sounds coming from the kitchen clearly indicated that someone was cooking inside.

However, today, Xiao Ming had come back to find his brother for dinner because the housekeeper was on leave, to prevent his brother, who could stay at home for ten days without going out, from starving to death at home.

So, who was in the kitchen?

Xiao Ming looked at the men's leather shoes next to Wei Zhenzhen's running shoes, and the gray coat draped over the chair back.

Xiao Ming frowned, sensing that something was not simple.

The author has something to say:
Wei Zhenzhen: Damn!
Wei Zhenming: Damn!
Xia Cheng: …Hello, brother, I am the new housekeeper.



He was startled, turning his head to see his brother's handsome face—though a bit dark.

”Why didn't you answer the phone?“ Wei Zhenming asked.

Wei Zhenzhen, who had not expected to see his brother, looked dazed, answering blankly, ”I left my phone in the room.“

Wei Zhenming nodded, lowering his eyes to look at the gray coat on the back of the sofa.

He raised his eyebrows, ”Who is in the kitchen?“

Wei Zhenzhen froze, fiddling with his nose and stammering.

Wei Zhenming looked at his younger brother, ”Not going to say?“

Wei Zhenming's younger brother looked miserable.

”I will go and see for myself,“ Wei Zhenming said, walking towards the kitchen.

Wei Zhenzhen suddenly stood up and grabbed his brother tightly.

”It's Xia Cheng!“ The CEO said, looking nervously at his elder brother and cautiously adding, ”I haven't eaten today, I'm hungry, Xia Cheng is cooking for me…“

Wei Zhenming looked at Wei Zhenzhen.

Wei Zhenzhen grabbed Wei Zhenming's sleeve.

”You're quite capable, Wei Zhenzhen,“ Wei Zhenming sat down, ”You've already introduced him to the family.“

”…It's just cooking,“ Wei Zhenzhen muttered, ”Xiao Ming, are you staying for dinner?“

Wei Zhenming thought for a moment and finally nodded.

Then he said, ”Call me brother.“

”Then I'll go tell Xia Cheng!“ Wei Zhenzhen completely ignored his brother's request and rushed into the kitchen like he was on fire.

Wei Zhenming watched his brother's actions without any unusual reaction, letting out a sigh of relief.

He could run and jump, so nothing substantial had happened yet.

Wei Zhenming felt he had wasted a lot of energy.

Wei Zhenzhen rushed into the kitchen and closed the door.

Xia Cheng turned to look at him, puzzled, ”The kitchen is smoky, why are you coming in?“

”…Uh, my brother…,“ Wei Zhenzhen awkwardly touched his nose, ”My brother is home and will be having dinner, so…“

Xia Cheng paused, raised his eyebrows, but his expression remained calm and composed.

He lightly tapped the spatula, ”Does Mr. Wei have any dietary restrictions?“

Wei Zhenzhen, smelling the aroma in the kitchen, leaned over to look at the stir-fried pork with peppers in Xia Cheng's pot.

His voice sounded muffled, ”My brother doesn't eat spicy food, at all.“

Xia Cheng nodded, deciding to only cook the spicy dish.

No wonder Wei Zhenzhen liked sweet food and his eyes turned red when he ate spicy food; he had probably developed the habit of avoiding spicy food by being with Wei Zhenming.

So, the final dishes were three dishes and a soup, with only the stir-fried pork with peppers carrying a spicy aroma.

Emperor Xiaoying glanced at Wei Zhenzhen hiding in the kitchen, opening a crack in the door to observe his brother, and coughed to bring his attention back, ”Help, carry the dishes.“

Wei Zhenzhen was already used to helping Xia Cheng cook during his vacation, so he immediately responded, carrying the tomato and egg soup from the prep station and walking out.

Xia Cheng followed behind with two plates of dishes.

Wei Zhenming watched his brother and Emperor Xiaoying coming out together, carrying dishes and whispering to each other, feeling a sense of being excluded by their默契.

Wei Zhenming's mood instantly turned a bit sour.

Emperor Xiaoying handed the two plates of dishes to Wei Zhenming with a smile, ”Nice to meet you, Mr. Wei, I am Xia Cheng.“

”Famous reputation, Emperor Xiaoying,“ Wei Zhenming nodded slightly.

Unlike Wei Zhenzhen's deliberately aloof and authoritative demeanor, Wei Zhenming had been accustomed to being in a position of power since childhood.

After all, he had been surrounded by the halo of an academic genius since he was young. Apart from his parents and elders, Wei Zhenming had never lowered his head to anyone.

Calling him a prodigy was not an exaggeration.

So, when Wei Zhenming was serious, the intimidating aura he exuded was not on the same level as Wei Zhenzhen's.

Emperor Xiaoying felt a moment of tension.

But the next second, he was distracted by Wei Zhenzhen, who had re-entered the kitchen to fetch the remaining dishes and utensils.

Wei Zhenzhen looked at his brother and gently tugged on Emperor Xiaoying's sleeve, ”The rice cooker is still in the kitchen; I just turned off the power.“

Emperor Xiaoying relaxed slightly, ”I'll go get it.“

As he spoke, he patted the CEO's head.

Wei Zhenming's hand holding the cup tightened.

His gaze at Xia Cheng's back was oddly dangerous.


Chapter 49:
Wei Zhiren glanced at his brother, then at Xiao Cheng's retreating figure, quietly arranging three sets of bowls and chopsticks, hesitating for a long time. When Xiao Cheng came over with the electric rice cooker, Wei Zhiren sat opposite his brother.

Then he helped Xiao Cheng fill the rice.

Wei Ziming watched Wei Zhiren's series of actions and felt even more irritated.

Could his younger brother really be pushed aside so quickly? !

How long had it been before he started helping a stranger?

Brother Ming was very angry, but he couldn't say anything now.

He looked at his brother, who was being overly solicitous towards Xiao Cheng, feeling a complex mix of emotions.

Xiao Cheng sat down with Wei Zhiren, and with his first chopsticks, he picked a piece of sweet and sour pork ribs for Wei Zhiren.

He was even serving food!

How infuriating!

Brother Ming held his rice bowl, looking at the two men opposite him expressionlessly.

Wei Zhiren seemed to sense his elder brother's resentment. Under Wei Ziming's gaze, he remained as quiet as a chicken, not daring to say a word, only daring to pick the stir-fried pork with peppers closest to him and Xiao Cheng.

His eyes turned red, tears welling up, but he only ate his rice quietly.

He looked extremely pitiful.

Wei Zhiren was mourning the lost opportunity to pursue Xiao Cheng.

If Brother Ming hadn't returned, he could have dated Xiao Cheng after finishing this meal!

Sigh.

Just thinking about it was heart-wrenching.

Wei Ziming remained expressionless, silently observing the two people opposite him with a stern face.

Xiao Cheng, seeing Wei Zhiren's eyes watering from the spicy food, kept serving him sweet and sour pork ribs and even brought another bowl of soup, placing it on Wei Zhiren's side.

He even patted the back of the President, helping Wei Zhiren, who was gasping from the spiciness, to relax.

Brother Ming watched, feeling his lungs ache with anger.

In the past, when little Zhen had eaten spicy food, he would cry and run to his arms, sticking out his tongue and sobbing, calling for his brother to blow it away!

Though it was probably something that happened when they were five or six!

But Brother Ming was still very angry!

Wei Zhiren ate his meal as quietly as a chicken, yet with great gusto.

After the meal, he sniffed and said while breathing in, ”I'll go put the dishes in the dishwasher and have a cup of yogurt to soothe the spiciness.“

Neither Mr. Xiao Shadow nor Brother Ming had any objections.

But after helping Wei Zhiren put away the dishes and chopsticks, Xiao Cheng still politely excused himself under Brother Ming's deathly glare.

Wei Ziming smiled coldly, ”Won't you stay for a cup of tea before leaving?“

Xiao Cheng returned a smile, unwilling to admit defeat, ”No need, the coffee Zhiren made earlier tasted quite good.“

Wei Ziming chuckled, ”Have a safe journey, Mr. Xiao Shadow.“

Xiao Cheng nodded, picking up his coat from the armrest of the sofa, ”Goodbye, Mr. Wei.“

Wei Zhiren sat in the kitchen, drinking three cups of yogurt, finally letting the spiciness in his mouth fade before peeking out the door.

Xiao Cheng had already left.

Only Brother Ming was sitting on the sofa in the living room, watching TV.

Wei Zhiren looked down at his slippers, thought for a moment, took them off, held them in his hand, and tiptoed silently to the staircase.

”Where are you going?“ Wei Ziming didn't even turn his head.

Wei Zhiren, who had been intercepted on his escape route by his brother, looked at his slippers, silently putting them down and re-putting them on, then pattered off to wash his hands and make coffee.

Hoping that for the sake of the coffee, Brother Ming wouldn't ruthlessly beat his younger brother's buttocks.

Wei Zhiren thought and obediently added two bags of cream and one cube of sugar according to his brother's taste, then brought the coffee to Wei Ziming, seeking forgiveness.

Brother Ming took the coffee.

He asked, ”Did you go out with Xiao Cheng?“

They were supposed to be going out.

Unfortunately, Empress Ming had broken up the couple, scattering the pair that hadn't been together yet.

Now he was attempting to ruthlessly beat one of the birds’ buttocks!

It was simply extremely brutal, cold-hearted, emotionless, and unreasonable.

Wei Zhiren sat beside his brother, looking obedient, ”We didn't go out.“

Wei Ziming let out a light hum, ”Didn't go out, but he's already in our house, cooking?“

Even serving him food! Even bringing him soup! Even patting his back to soothe him!

A real wife wouldn't be so solicitous!

Wei Zhiren felt extremely wronged, ”I haven't eaten all day, I'm hungry, and I don't want to go out.“

Brother Ming looked lovingly, ”You could order takeaway, my silly child.“

Wei Zhiren: ”……“

Who had been telling him every day that takeaway was unhygienic and shouldn't be eaten.

Could Xiao Cheng be even more terrifying than takeaway? !

Brother Ming took a leisurely sip of coffee, ”Tell me, what did Xiao Cheng come to our house for? He can't have come just to look at your watch.“

F*ck.

Watch.

You're very smart, Ming.

Wei Zhiren was dumbfounded.

Without an answer, Brother Ming looked at his stunned younger brother and let out a light hum, ”Hmm?“

Wei Zhiren instantly snapped back to reality.

Then he hesitated, feeling awkward, ”Xiao Cheng… Xiao Cheng said he wants to pursue me.“

Wei Ziming was shocked by his brother's shy appearance.

—Heaven knows, Wei Ziming had always thought his thick-skinned, wall-like brother didn't have the emotional capacity to feel shy.

He never expected that it was only because he wouldn't be shy in front of him.

Brother Ming felt a bitter taste in his heart.

His brother was growing up, and he didn't know how to take care of him anymore.

Wei Ziming drank a sip of coffee with a solemn face, the aroma rich and slightly sweet.

He was silent for a while, then turned to his brother seriously and said, ”Since he wants to pursue you, let him pursue you slowly.“

Then he added, ”We are all men; we all know that someone who is too easily pursued won't be cherished.“

If not for Brother Ming's appearance, his younger brother, who was already prepared to give a clear answer, would have said, ”……“

In fact, he had been searching for him for several years.

Wei Zhiren thought for a moment but didn't say anything.

He felt that there was a hint of STK in it.

If Brother Ming knew, he might explode.

”Hmm… I'm not very familiar with the entertainment industry,“ Wei Ziming drank the coffee his brother had made, ”Xiao Cheng at least needs to have a… Bisca, to be worthy of you.“

Wei Zhiren, looking shocked, ”……“

The President calculated and thought his brother was diplomatically disagreeing with him and Xiao Cheng being together.

Wei Zhiren lowered his head and took out his phone.

He was going to ask Mr. Xiao Shadow if he wanted to run away with him.

The author has something to say: Wei Zhiren: Helping to break up a couple, cold and heartless!

Wei Ziming: ? I'm very open-minded, okay? Every word I say is genuine, okay!? Oh my God! I'm just very angry!

Xiao Cheng: I'm here filming; running away isn't very convenient, how about we run away to the film city? [x



Because he was forced by his elder brother to change his clothes and then dragged out for a strenuous workout that made Wei Zhiren sob and cry in agony.

They went night running, five kilometers.

The reclusive Wei Zhiren panted the whole way, feeling that his bed had never been so welcoming when he rolled back into the house.

However, his cold, heartless, and unreasonable elder brother still didn't let him sleep, making him walk around the house a few times to cool off before allowing him to take a bath and sleep.

Wei Zhiren hadn't slept so soundly in a long time.

He hadn't woken up so painfully in a long time.

Every part of his body hurt, any movement tugging at his muscles, even a slight movement causing him to grimace in pain.

Wei Zhiren lay in bed, looking at the ceiling, feeling that he was close to death.

Wei Ziming was tying his tie, symbolically knocking on the door, then pushing it open to look at his brother lying on the bed like a corpse.

”You haven't gone to work for so long, it's time to go to work,“ Brother Ming said coldly.

Wei Zhiren, in pain, covered his face, ”Let me be a peaceful salted fish, Ming, we agreed you would support me for life, you heartless bastard.“

”At that time, you were like a lump of clay that couldn't be lifted up, now that you've been lifted up, don't think about turning back into a lump.“

Wei Ziming opened Wei Zhiren's wardrobe, throwing a few clothes on the bed. Seeing Wei Zhiren still indifferent, he paused.

”And Xiao Cheng won't like a lump, trust me.“

Wei Zhiren pulled off the blanket and sat up with a hiss.

Wei Ziming: ”……“

Tsk.


Chapter 50:
Wei Zhenzhen ultimately limped to the company with a sore back and waist, his limbs so aching that he had to slow his pace. Upon seeing Wei Zhenzhen, Assistant Director Wang felt immense delight and surprise. With the president absent, all the work had been redirected to him, and Assistant Director Wang was on the verge of being overwhelmed. No amount of bonus could salvage his receding hairline. Unable to resist, he touched his head, feeling that he might go bald at a young age. Then he stood up and met Wei Zhenzhen, who was heading towards the president's office, only to notice that something was amiss with the president today. He walked slowly, with an… unusual posture. Assistant Director Wang recalled the photograph of President Wei on Xiao Cheng's Weibo and the fact that President Wei had gone on a seaside vacation with Xiao Yinger, only to return to work looking like this… Assistant Director Wang shuddered. He felt as if he had discovered some monumental secret. ——How could one say that there was no need to treat Xiao Cheng specially! Assistant Director Wang took a deep breath, elevating Xiao Cheng's status in his mind. This was not just any actor! This was an actor who could overshadow their president! Assistant Director Wang took another deep breath, following Wei Zhenzhen into the office. He carefully observed the president's weary expression and cautiously asked, ”President Wei, are you alright?“ Wei Zhenzhen waved his hand, took off his glasses to wipe them, and then put them back on. Assistant Director Wang said earnestly, ”You must be moderate, President Wei. You are still young; do not harm your health.“ Wei Zhenzhen, who was four years younger than his assistant, was utterly bewildered by the advice. He stared at Assistant Director Wang for a while before gradually understanding what was being said. President Wei was at a loss for words. He pushed his glasses, ”You are overthinking, Assistant Director Wang. I only went for a night run with my brother last night.“ Despite Wei Zhenzhen's efforts to maintain his image of a domineering and aloof president in front of others, Assistant Director Wang did not believe him, thinking it was an excuse. What were the hallmarks of a domineering president? Handsome face, long legs, and a sweet voice. Slim figure when dressed and toned muscles when undressed. Assistant Director Wang shook his head in disbelief, ”A night run could not make you this exhausted?“ Wei Zhenzhen pushed his glasses again. I really am a shut-in; I feel so embarrassed. Wei Zhenzhen did not care whether Assistant Director Wang believed him and interrupted the conversation by lightly tapping the table. He asked, ”Where are the recent transaction records?“ Assistant Director Wang placed the thick folder on the table. Wei Zhenzhen sighed deeply. Damn it, I should have learned from Little Ming Brother and had the company send over tasks via fax while on vacation. Wei Zhenzhen knew that he was in for a grueling period of overtime. The investment in Weicheng had already matured, and there were not many tasks for him to handle. Out of the thick stack of documents, only about one-fifth were related to the investment department. The rest were regarding the newly established film and television department. Personnel transfers, new recruit selections, star artists from other companies interested in switching, and requests for additional equipment and venues in the new company building. Wei Zhenzhen looked at the budget sheet and felt overwhelmed. He decided to delegate the matter to the financial officer of the investment department. The president, who had not come to work for nearly half a month, swiftly processed the accumulated documents. Even with his high efficiency, the pile of documents barely decreased by the end of the morning. Wei Zhenzhen got up, deciding to have lunch. He lowered his head to scroll through his phone as he walked out. Just as he entered Xiao Cheng's Weibo post about the cooperation with Weicheng, he saw a group of fans expressing their distrust in the newly emerging company. Having just escaped from the hellhole of Light and Shadow, the fans were like startled birds, fearing that Xiao Cheng would go from one wolf's den to another. The fans’ emotions were not as easy to sway as the media's. Wei Zhenzhen flipped through the comments and saw several familiar IDs among the doubts. They were the girls from the core fan group, expressing genuine concern and skepticism. Not only that, the fans worried about Xiao Cheng flooded the official website and Weibo of Weicheng's film and television department, expressing their care and desire for more information about the company. Wei Zhenzhen paused his finger on the screen, tapping on the familiar IDs. President Wei thought deeply as the elevator doors opened, coincidentally encountering the head of the public relations department. President Wei raised an eyebrow, nodded in greeting, and entered the elevator with the head of the department, sitting together. He handed the phone to the head of the department to read the content. Wei Zhenzhen took a bite of meat and asked, ”What do you think?“ The head of the department shook his head, ”Weicheng has not established a strong foothold in the entertainment industry yet. It is best not to respond to any criticisms. Once Xiao Cheng's first work with Weicheng is released, we can address the situation more easily.“ Wei Zhenzhen listened with a pained expression. He understood the reasoning but felt a bit unhappy seeing Weicheng's film and television department criticized by so many long-time fans. Wei Zhenzhen lowered his head to eat. After a while, he turned to the head of the department and said, ”I think we can be more bold.“ The head of the department paused his eating, looking at Wei Zhenzhen, ”How so?“ Wei Zhenzhen lowered his voice and leaned in, ”Xiao Cheng has a chance at a Hollywood Lens role, the male third in a series of films. He is going for the audition in the next few days, and the results will be out before Christmas.“ The head of the department was startled, also lowering his voice, ”I have not heard of this.“ ”Yes, because I arranged it privately.“ Wei Zhenzhen pursed his lips, choosing his words carefully, ”I have confidence in Xiao Cheng. Therefore, I believe we can be more bold in addressing these criticisms. If Xiao Cheng secures the role, we can use this opportunity to promote him—of course, provided they allow us to leak information early.“ The head of the public relations department nodded, continuing to eat and think, occasionally exchanging a few words with Wei Zhenzhen. It was well-known that debunking rumors and clarifying malicious events in the entertainment industry were not necessarily better done earlier. Usually, public relations teams would wait until the peak of the controversy had passed and the public opinion was less intense before issuing a statement. Of course, there were exceptions. Such as the criticism Weicheng was facing. This was not a malicious event. The doubts came from fans, who were expressing genuine concern for Xiao Cheng rather than malicious slander or attacks. Therefore, after having lunch with the head of the public relations department, they left. An hour later, Weicheng's official website and Weibo simultaneously released an announcement. To be more precise, it was an announcement inviting fans to participate in a lottery. Since the construction of Weicheng's film and television department was scheduled to be completed three days before New Year's Day, Wei Zhenzhen and the head of the public relations department decided to have people visit. Excluding the new recruits who had passed the interviews but not signed contracts yet, the only artist currently announced by Weicheng was Xiao Cheng. Therefore, the lottery was limited to Xiao Cheng's fans. Thirty fans of Xiao Cheng would be selected to visit the newly completed office building of Weicheng's film and television department during the New Year's Day holiday. Live streaming and photography were allowed, except for damaging equipment; everything else was permitted to assuage the fans‘ concerns. If a zombie account or someone unable to attend was drawn, they would be redrawn. In summary, they would gather thirty people, plus some well-known fans in the fan circle—especially those who always helped organize airport pickups and maintain event order—ensuring ten of them were invited. A total of forty fans would be brought to B City to visit Weicheng's new film and television department, with accommodation, meals, and transportation covered, as long as they attended. When the Weibo post was released, the fans were first shocked by Weicheng's generosity, then praised their frank and generous attitude, and finally vied to be part of the lottery. At first, they were jokingly sharing it, and Wei Zhenzhen saw it and shared it too. However, just three minutes after he shared it, Xiao Cheng also retweeted the lottery post. Xiao Cheng: Can I join in for fun? Count me as the 41st participant. The boss should cover my accommodation, meals, and transportation, right? [doge] The fans immediately exploded.


Chapter 51:
The Author Has Something to Say: Wei Zhiren: Great! I can take you both. Ah, little demon, you are just mischievous. [Seductively Glinting Eyes.jpg]

Xiao Cheng: It seems you are hinting at something... [Passionately Glaring Eyes.jpg]



Xiao Cheng's fans instantly went wild, frenziedly reposting that lottery tweet, hoping to increase their chances of winning.

Wei Zhiren stared in disbelief at Xiao Cheng's tweet, then picked up the phone on the table and dialed the PR department's extension.

”Are you asking Xiao Cheng to help you?“ Wei Zhiren asked.

However, the PR department head was equally bewildered, ”I was just about to ask if President Wei had talked to Xiao Cheng.“

Wei Zhiren was dumbfounded for a moment: ”I didn't.“

The head was also puzzled: ”We didn't either.“

So it must have been Xiao Cheng causing trouble himself.

Wei Zhiren never expected his idol to get involved in such matters.

He opened his QQ, took a screenshot of the tweet, and sent six dots to Dr. Monkey.

Xiao Cheng was currently one of the audition judges for Director Xu's new film, helping Xu with the selection process.

Director Xu's new work was aiming for an award, so he took it very seriously.

Yet, Xu, who had been unable to find a satisfactory actor, paused the auditions, trying to calm himself down by taking deep breaths.

”What do they think my movie is?!“ Director Xu held a stack of thick resumes, slapping the table, ”They send a bunch of people who are good for nothing except their looks when they hear it's for an award?“

”They lack acting skills, can't even memorize their lines, who gave them the confidence to inflate their resumes so much!“

Xiao Cheng glanced at Xu, who failed to calm down, and took a bottle of ice water from the side, opening it and handing it over.

Xiao Cheng, the Emperor of Cinema, and Xu had been close friends for years, so he spoke candidly without any reserve.

He said, ”It's better than them directly investing and forcing you to take in actors with funding, like they did before.“

Xu snorted but had to admit that Xiao Cheng was right.

”Thank heavens you went to Wei City,“ Xu drank half the bottle of water, ”Only Wei City's boss would invest in your film without caring and give you such freedom.“

The cost of Xu's film was neither high nor low; as it aimed for an award, they largely ignored box office returns.

Half of the budget came from Xu's savings over the years, another half was a friendly contribution from Xiao Cheng, and the rest was investment from Wei City, where Xiao Cheng currently stood.

Wei City not only invested but also provided significant freedom.

There were no actors with funding, no people forcing their way into the film just for experience, and no strange specified candidates.

In simple terms, Wei City only provided the money, leaving all other matters to Xu and Xiao Cheng.

Such a partnership was ideal for any director in the industry.

It was like a dream come true.

”Xiao Cheng, I've known you for nearly a decade. Tell me the truth.“

Xu held the water bottle, looked around suspiciously as if he were a thief, then lowered his voice.

He asked, ”Are you...?“

As he spoke, he extended his pinky finger.

Xiao Cheng pressed his pinky down, his expression and tone completely calm: ”No.“

Xu didn't believe him: ”That's no fun.“

Xiao Cheng, the Emperor of Cinema, looked up at Xu, ”To be precise, I'm chasing him, but haven't caught him yet.“

Xu looked shocked: ”You're chasing that... Wei Zhiren, and you haven't caught him yet?“

Xiao Cheng nodded, not understanding why Xu seemed so surprised.

”Doesn't he like you? Why would he keep investing in you and try to lure you away—listen, I've heard that you have a casting invitation from Hollywood, right? It's from Wei Zhiren?“

Xiao Cheng paused, not surprised that Xu, given his status in the film industry, would know about such matters.

”He cares so much about you that he would reject your confession!?“

Xu couldn't believe it.

”Are you... not good enough?“

Xiao Cheng, the Emperor of Cinema, looked at Xu disdainfully.

He unscrewed another bottle of water for Xu, then took out his phone to scan the latest messages. Seeing the six dots from Wei Zhiren, he raised an eyebrow.

Zhiren: ...

Little Black Monkey: Really, aren't you going to cover my accommodation?

Little Black Monkey: [Crying in a Ball.jpg]

Zhiren: Damn it! You sell your cuteness too well, Dr. Monkey!

Zhiren: Besides, you have a house and a car in B City, what do you need me to cover?

Little Black Monkey: You could cover me though :)

Wei Zhiren looked at the messages Xiao Cheng sent, shuddering slightly.

Zhiren: I sincerely hope you can be more reserved, Dr. Monkey...

Zhiren: And can you please inform me before you start causing trouble?

Little Black Monkey: Because I saw there were no work plans during the New Year's holiday, sorry, I'll be more careful next time :)

Wei Zhiren blinked at the screen, tapping lightly on his keyboard with his fingertips.

Zhiren: ...It's not a big deal.

Zhiren: Just be more careful next time, bye-bye [Cute.jpg]

Xiao Cheng, the Emperor of Cinema, frowned, looking at the ”bye-bye“ for a long time, unsure of what to say.

Finally, he reviewed the chat history for the day, looked at the date, and replied.

Little Black Monkey: Are you free tomorrow?

Wei Zhiren was taken aback, then laughed immediately.

Zhiren: Yes, my monkey, are you inviting me to dinner again? [Scared Me, I Hugged My Little Carp.jpg]

Little Black Monkey: ...

Little Black Monkey: No, I want to invite you climbing.

Zhiren: ... [Black Man Asking.jpg]

Zhiren: I hope you can be a bit more considerate to the introverts.

Xiao Cheng paused.

Little Black Monkey: Who dragged you to exercise?

Zhiren: Brother Xiaoming. [Indifferent.jpg]

Zhiren: After you left yesterday, Brother Xiaoming insisted on taking me for a night run, we ran five kilometers, I was so scared, my assistant's brain turned yellow.

Xiao Cheng couldn't help but laugh.

Little Black Monkey: So you're not going tomorrow?

Wei Zhiren not going?

Nonsense, he would definitely go!

Zhiren: Go, go, go, not going is not Chinese!

Little Black Monkey: Good boy [Petting Dog Head.gif]

Xiao Cheng looked at Director Xu, who was observing him, tapping the table, ”Hurry up and continue the auditions, I don't have time tomorrow.“

Director Xu, holding the ice water to calm himself, was stunned, ”I heard from Xiao Xiaomai that your schedule is free recently.“

Xiao Cheng chuckled lightly, lowering his head to tap his phone screen, showing Xu the last part of the message, ”I have a date tomorrow, interfering with people's love life will get you kicked by a donkey, Director Xu.“

Xu: ”...“

I want to kick the dog food in front of me!

The Author Has Something to Say: Wei Zhiren: Bye-bye

Xiao Cheng: Bye-bye

Xu: ...F*ck



People often went in groups to climb the mountain, though young people accounted for a smaller proportion. On weekends and holidays, mostly middle-aged and elderly people leisurely walked up the cobblestone path.

Xiao Cheng and Mr. President had arranged to meet on a weekend.

Xiao Cheng managed to squeeze it in between his busy schedule, while Wei Zhiren was dragged for a night run by his brother the previous day, naturally, he couldn't run far.

So they decided to go to this mountain not too high but not too low in the outskirts.

Winter had arrived, the lush greenery on the mountain was replaced by fallen leaves and branches, only a few evergreen trees remained dark green.

The weather was decent, the sun peeked out from behind the thick clouds.

Wei Zhiren dozed off in the passenger seat.


Chapter 52:
He worked overtime until very late last night and only returned home then. Today, Xiao Cheng arrived at his building, and he was woken up by a call from Xiao Yingtai, groggily washing up and putting on his sports outfit before following Xiao Cheng into the car.

It was as if he had been dragged away to be sold by the pound and was still in a daze.

Xiao Yingtai looked at the red light at the intersection, pressed the brakes, and then turned to look at the sleeping Mr. President.

Then he reached out to adjust the temperature of the air conditioning in the car a bit higher.

There were few people on the mountain road, and even those who enjoyed exercising did not wish to leave their warm houses on such a cold day, let alone spend their rare weekend climbing the mountain—knowing that the temperature at the summit was much lower than at the foot of the mountain.

Xiao Cheng easily found a parking spot, glanced at the sparsely parked cars, and then bent down to pinch Wei Zhiru's nose.

When Wei Zhiru opened his eyes, everything seemed dark.

He turned his vision drowsily and saw Xiao Cheng's face close to his, instantly waking up.

Mr. President rubbed the nose that the Emperor had pinched, straightened his body, and turned his head to peer out the window.

”It's here!“ His voice still carried the drowsiness and hoarseness of just waking up, but there was a clear happiness in it.

Xiao Cheng lowered the back of his seat, turned around to pick up the equipment on the back seat.

”Happy?“ He asked casually.

”Yes, I come here often…though usually by cable car. The temple on the mountain is very efficacious, and the vegetarian meal is quite delicious.“

Wei Zhiru lowered his seat back, turned around, and picked up his hat and scarf.

”But I came up in the first half of the year, and after that, I've been quite busy.“

Busy with bringing Xiao Cheng over to his side.

Wei Zhiru thought happily, reaching for the scarf on the back seat.

His deep red scarf got entangled with Xiao Cheng's gray and white checkered scarf, and he picked up both.

Mr. President paused his movement, looked at the two scarves in his hands, pondered for a while, and then turned to look at Xiao Yingtai, who was putting on his hat.

”Sir, may I ask if you dropped this red scarf, or this red scarf, or this red scarf?“ Mr. President asked.

Hearing this, Xiao Cheng turned to Wei Zhiru, reached up to tuck his ears into his hat, and looked at Mr. President with a smile that was not quite a smile.

Then, under Wei Zhiru's pitiful gaze, he took back his gray and white checkered scarf.

Xiao Yingtai asked with a smile, ”Is Wei Banxian fond of my scarf?“

Wei Zhiru nodded his head like a chick pecking for food, ”I like everything of Cheng's!“

Xiao Cheng's eyebrows twitched, gestured to Mr. President with his fingers, ”Banxian, come closer.“

Mr. President hesitated for a moment, then obediently moved closer.

Xiao Cheng draped the scarf in his hand around Wei Zhiru's neck, wrapped it twice, and tied a beautiful bow.

After doing all this, Xiao Yingtai gently patted Mr. President's head, ”Since Banxian likes it, it's for Banxian.“

Mr. President stared at Xiao Yingtai for a while.

Then he shrunk his neck, pulled the scarf up a bit, trying to block the blush spreading over his cheeks and ears.

Mr. President felt that the air conditioning was a bit too hot, making him feel a bit stuffy—seeming to have already sweated on his back.

However, Xiao Yingtai directly saw through his attempt to hide his embarrassment: ”No need to hide, I saw it all.“

Xiao Cheng was in a very good mood. He put on his mask and tied his scarf.

The only eye exposed showed a bright and happy mood.

Mr. President silently put on his mask, then silently put on his hat, and finally silently picked up his coat and opened the car door.

The cold air outside hit him, making Wei Zhiru, who was not wearing a coat, shiver.

The heat on his face receded like a wave.

Mr. President put on his coat, turned back, and picked up the large backpack from the back seat.

Xiao Yingtai also got out of the car.

The foot of the mountain was unusually quiet today. Looking around, there were only about five or six cars parked.

”What's in the backpack?“ Xiao Yingtai casually picked up Mr. President's backpack, slightly stunned.

It was actually quite heavy.

”We won't reach the summit before noon, so I brought some bread and a few bottles of water, as well as the Heart Sutra that my mother copied during her free time at home.“

Wei Zhiru lifted the backpack and felt that it was indeed quite heavy.

”Let's have the vegetarian meal at the temple in the evening! Eat and then take the cable car down.“

Xiao Cheng nodded; he had never had a vegetarian meal at the temple on the mountain summit.

Xiao Yingtai watched Mr. President, who walked forward with his backpack like he knew his way around, ”Mrs. President believes in Buddhism?“

Wei Zhiru shook his head, ”No, I just think copying it can accumulate blessings and help me stay calm, so I copy a few whenever I have free time and bring them to the temple every few months.“

Xiao Yingtai looked at the bulging backpack, ”I'll carry it.“

”No, this time I'm definitely going to walk the whole way.“ Wei Zhiru dodged Xiao Cheng's hand, his face serious, ”I'm climbing the mountain to pray to the Buddha with all my sincerity this time!“

Xiao Yingtai had a question mark on his face.

”I'm going to the temple to ask for a sign for you.“ Wei Zhiru lifted his backpack again, ”I hope the Bodhimanda will give you a great fortune this time since I didn't take the cable car.“

Xiao Cheng: ”…“

I think it's great if the Bodhimanda pays attention to you.

However, despite Xiao Yingtai's words, Mr. President insisted on carrying the backpack of Heart Sutras and walking the whole way.

Less than two kilometers in, Mr. President's head started to sweat.

Xiao Yingtai had a new understanding of Mr. President's physical strength.

But unable to stop him, Xiao Yingtai could only quietly stand by and be a water boy.

By noon, Xiao Yingtai and Mr. President sat on the roadside eating six pineapple tarts, finally satisfying their hunger.

Xiao Yingtai even took two photos of the pineapple tarts, one before and one after they were eaten, and posted them on Weibo.

Xiao Cheng: Grateful for the lunch, have a good trip. [Candle][Image][Image]

Wei Zhiru did not expect Xiao Cheng to be so bored.

He bit the last pineapple tart, looked over to Xiao Cheng, and then, while stretching his legs, opened Weibo with his mouth still full of bread.

Xiao Cheng's fans were very excited.

Extremely excited.

Chengcheng's Little Bellybutton: Oh my God, did I see wrong? Cheng actually posted two posts in three days! That's almost daily! [Exclamation mark]

Chengcheng Is Beautiful: [Stunned Eyes.jpg] I never thought Cheng could eat so many, six! Pineapple tarts! I'm full with just one! [Exclamation mark]

Jenny Cross-Dimensional Love for Chengcheng: My god, please teach me how to maintain my figure [Bow.jpg]

Where Is Spring: I think since Cheng went to the new company, he's been letting loose… Starting from that vacation post, he's completely different from the cold and formal one who only posts announcements and program promotions before! I like this Cheng, keep it up! Most importantly, make sure to include self-portraits! pr


Chapter 53:
Wei Zhiren vaguely remembered that something like this had indeed happened, and thus nodded casually.

After all, Xiao Cheng would not cause any irreparable disasters, and Wei Zhiren felt quite at ease.

After eliminating two bottles of water and provisions, the backpack was lightened by a great deal. Deprived of the heavy burden, Wei Zhiren felt as though he could take flight.

”Walking slowly, we should reach there in about two more hours,“ Mr. President weighed the backpack. To ensure he did not end up sealed in bed tomorrow, he decided not to take flight.

The two walked and stopped along the mountain path, moving at a leisurely pace and not sweating much.

Xiao Cheng and Wei Zhiren had long since removed their masks and hats due to the heat from their exertion, chatting idly as they walked.

This extremely inefficient mode of travel directly resulted in their arrival at the temple on the mountain top being much later than the estimated two hours.

The temple appeared quite ancient, though not in ruins. The door and walls had a layer of light gray from smoke, but the Buddha niches were all meticulously cleaned.

Wei Zhiren looked around and handed the Heart Sutra to the monk beside him with a smile, then took the divination tube, knelt on the cushion, and drew a slip of paper.

Mr. President picked up the slip and ran to find the old monk sitting nearby.

The old monk glanced at the slip, pushed his glasses up, and looked at Wei Zhiren again, ”It's Little Wei, hasn't it been half a year?“

He paused for a moment, carefully examining the young man before him, ”You look so cheerful, is there good news?“

Wei Zhiren turned his head to glance at Xiao Cheng, who was standing outside the door and did not come in, scratched his head, and chuckled at the old monk.

The old monk followed Wei Zhiren's gaze, his expression revealing sudden realization, then he withdrew his gaze and looked at the slip in his hand.

The old monk spoke slowly, ”A good slip, what are you seeking?“

”Career,“ Wei Zhiren grinned foolishly after hearing it was a good slip, then pointed to Xiao Cheng outside, ”I'm seeking it for him.“

The old monk nodded and stood up to take a yellow paper slip with vermilion ink from the wall of slips, then took a small brocade bag from beside him. Without interpreting the slip for Wei Zhiren or saying much more, he placed the slip inside the bag and handed it to Wei Zhiren.

Wei Zhiren received it and thanked him softly.

”Are you staying to have dinner here?“ the old monk asked.

Wei Zhiren held up two fingers, ”Two people!“

The old monk called a monk to sit there, then stood up and went to the back of the temple.

Wei Zhiren returned to Xiao Cheng and handed him the brocade bag.

Mr. President's face was radiant, looking extremely happy, ”Keep it with you, return it after the audition ends, and fulfill your vow.“

Xiao Cheng paused, ”It looks like a good slip?“

Wei Zhiren shook his head, ”I think it should be very auspicious.“

Xiao Cheng looked at the brocade bag in his hand, silent for a long time, ”I also want to seek one.“

Wei Zhiren was taken aback, ”Seek what?“

”Seek a match,“ Emperor of Shadows tucked the brocade bag away and looked at Mr. President beside him, ”I want to know… when the person I like will agree to my pursuit.“



Wei Zhiren could not help but fall into deep thought.

Perhaps because Mr. President had been silent for quite some time, Emperor of Shadows could not help feeling a bit awkward.

He raised his hand to his lips, coughed lightly, and said, ”We already have a good slip, asking again seems a bit greedy?“

”It is a bit,“ Wei Zhiren looked at Xiao Cheng, ”Xiao Cheng, you…“

He licked his lips and asked, ”Have you thought about the future?“

Mr. President's expression was very serious, ”Are you planning to come out?“

Xiao Cheng was different from ordinary people; any display of emotional inclination would have some impact on his career.

Even if Xiao Cheng's acting skills were enough for him to be at the top of this circle, there were many talented actors who had been unknown for decades due to lack of popularity.

Ultimately, the film and entertainment industry valued popularity the most.

With high popularity, even if one accidentally took on a bad movie and fell, there were still many fans willing to support with money.

With low popularity, falling was truly falling, with few chances to recover.

Xiao Cheng, although not of the sell-boyfriend type, announcing his emotional inclination was still a major gamble with his current status.

—Especially coming out.

Wei Zhiren could not imagine the extent of the impact and abuse Xiao Cheng would face if he came out.

The real world's acceptance of homosexuality was much lower than people imagined.

Even with online communities celebrating and forming couples, many homosexuals still kept it a secret out of fear.

Xiao Cheng was a public figure with high national appeal. Given the current climate, a highly nationalistic star coming out would face troubles that Wei Zhiren could not handle.

Even Wei Ming could not act under such immense political pressure.

The most likely outcome was being thoroughly blacklisted amidst ridicule.

Wei Zhiren could not imagine it.

If Xiao Cheng suffered such treatment because of him, Wei Zhiren would probably suffer and regret it for a lifetime.

Xiao Cheng did not know about the complex thoughts in Wei Zhiren's mind.

For Emperor of Shadows, if you like me and I like you, then being together is a matter of course, what does it have to do with others?

Wei Zhiren waited for a long time without receiving an answer from Xiao Cheng.

Mr. President pursed his lips, ”Have you thought about what we will do… after we are together?“

”I will definitely come out,“ Xiao Cheng's expression was surprised, ”Do you think I would hide your existence and my orientation, not publicizing my feelings?“

Wei Zhiren was more worried precisely because he knew Xiao Cheng was not that kind of person.

”If it's publicized, do you know what you…“

”I said from the beginning, I don't care about that reputation,“ Emperor of Shadows sighed lightly, reaching out to hold Wei Zhiren's hand, pulling him to a small corner nearby.

”I don't care about being attacked, blacklisted, or anything else—those who support me will always support me, and those who only attack me online with rhetoric are unlikely to stab me in the face.“

In other words, once you turn off your computer and disconnect the internet, where can you find me?

Xiao Cheng's concern for Wei Zhiren was always above his career.

Moreover, his wealth did not come solely from acting; he was also skilled at investments—losing his acting career, he could easily become a successful investor.

It was merely a shift from the front to the back stage, and life would be even more comfortable.

Mr. President's mood was complex.

He felt secretly elated by Xiao Cheng's straightforward expression of care, yet was also agitated and degraded by it.

Wei Zhiren's face was stern, ”They curse you, and I'm not happy.“

”…“ Emperor of Shadows was at a loss for words.

He did not know whether to be happy about Mr. President's care for him or to scold the overly sensitive Mr. President.

”You haven't agreed to me yet, why think so far?“ Emperor of Shadows raised an eyebrow, ”Or are you preparing to agree?“

”Agreeing to you is not impossible,“ Wei Zhiren lowered his head to look at the hand tightly held by Emperor of Shadows, ”But Brother Ming said, you shouldn't be too easily pursued.“

Emperor of Shadows never expected that the greatest obstacle would come from Mr. President's brother.

He was silent


Chapter 54:
Reclining opposite Xiao Cheng and Wei Zhiren, Liu Xiaomai gazed at the pair who were leaning against each other, and then at their interlocked fingers, feeling his jaw about to drop with astonishment.

The agent's voice was somewhat feeble: ”Are you together?“

Xiao Cheng raised his head and shot Liu Xiaomai a sharp glance.

He was stirring up trouble.

The CEO glanced at Liu Xiaomai and then at his and Xiao Yindi's clasped hands.

He paused, waving the other hand. ”You are overthinking it.“

The tone was as insincere as could be.

Liu Xiaomai: ”……“

My eyes are not blind!

Liu Xiaomai felt his heart grow weary. He did not question Xiao Cheng and Wei Zhiren why such an important matter had not been informed to him first.

He merely weakly said, ”You should be more discreet. If you are caught…“

Xiao Cheng looked at the empty restroom, thinking that being caught would be perfect, a pity there was no one around.

Wei Zhiren, however, instantly withdrew his hand, and after pulling it back, he seemed unsatisfied and moved it further away.

Xiao Yindi lowered his head to look at his empty hand. ”……“

The Emperor of Shadows gave his agent a chilly look, clearly indicating his intention to settle accounts later.

Liu Xiaomai stuck out his neck and glared at Xiao Yindi, feeling deeply wronged.

What is wrong with me?!

Is there anything wrong with reminding him? General Manager Wei listened obediently without any objection. Why are you glaring at me?!

I have been stressing over this for who?!

Liu Xiaomai felt as if he were an overworked father, yet Xiao Cheng did not appreciate his efforts.

A knock came from outside the room, reminding them that it was time to board the flight.

Wei Zhiren patted Xiao Cheng's shoulder. ”With the expectations of the people of our country, brave youth, go create a miracle!“

Xiao Yindi chuckled lightly as he stood up and leaned over to Wei Zhiren who was sitting on the sofa.

His voice was low, filled with a strange allure. ”A brave youth needs a little encouragement.“

The CEO slightly leaned back, attempting to evade this subtle request.

However, just as he was about to silently move to the side, he was held by the shoulder by the Emperor of Shadows, and a cool, damp kiss landed on the CEO's forehead.

”Let's go.“ Xiao Yindi straightened up, touched the CEO's head, waved his sleeves, and left elegantly, leaving Wei Zhiren dumbfounded and Liu Xiaomai in a state of collapse.

Wei Zhiren's body was stiff, and he looked silently at the equally stunned Liu Xiaomai.

After a while, he stammered, ”He… he… I… that… he…“

The agent made a prompt decision. ”Yes, he kissed you, although not mouth to mouth.“

Then Liu Xiaomai saw Wei Zhiren's face turn red as a tomato at an observable speed.

…

On Christmas Day, the streets were adorned with lights and decorations.

And all of this had nothing to do with the group of overworking individuals in Weicheng.

Christmas did not mean a holiday.

Even if it did, they might still be unable to escape the fate of overtime!

Wei Zhiren was also working overtime, with Wang Tezhu assisting him with the latest progress report.

Just as the CEO was pondering, a commotion came from outside the office.

There were not few people who stayed back to work in Weicheng. Counting on one's fingers, there were over a dozen, and now these dozen or so people were bustling about, standing up from their desks, seemingly quite excited.

President Wei glanced at Wang Tezhu.

Wang Tezhu looked back at him blankly.

The CEO frowned, took off his glasses, pinched his nose bridge, and stood up.

Before he could reach the office door, a large bouquet of beautifully packaged crimson roses appeared at the door.

Wei Zhiren was startled. His first reaction was to turn to Wang Tezhu. ”Is it from your girlfriend?“

Wang Tezhu had a cold expression. ”President Wei, I do not have a girlfriend.“

”Then…“

”A question: Is Wei Zhiren in this office?“ came a voice from behind the bouquet.

The CEO looked dumbfounded at the bouquet of roses. At the sound of the question, his heart skipped a beat.

But President Wei remained unperturbed, nodding lightly. ”I am.“

”This is from… an anonymous sender.“ The flower boy, having confirmed his target, entered the office, peeking out from behind the almost obliterating bouquet and handed it to Wei Zhiren.

Wei Zhiren was somewhat at a loss, reaching out to take it. Just as he was about to say something, seeing the drawing of a monkey on the card inside the bouquet, he silently closed his mouth and obediently signed for the huge bouquet of roses.

The lips that were usually pressed into a straight line could not be pulled down any longer. The beautiful lips curved into a pretty arc, softening President Wei's usually icy expression.

The office workers, the sharpest at reading people, immediately felt relieved upon seeing Wei Zhiren's uncontainable smile and started whistling and cheering wildly.

The result of their cheering was Wei Zhiren treating them to a feast. He promptly decided to take everyone out for dinner, the place was up to them!

The whistling in the office grew louder.

”Ooh ooh ooh Wei Zhiren is awesome!“

”Hooray! Die, overtime!“

Holding the bouquet of roses, Wei Zhiren coldly shut the door, blocking out the cheers of the employees and Wang Tezhu.

He took out his phone, placed the bouquet of roses under the light, and took a photo.

The CEO, with a subtle feeling of showing off, posted the photo of the roses on Weibo.

ZhirenZhiren: Merry Christmas! :)[photo]

Just after posting the photo, Wei Zhiren received a notification of special attention.

Xiao Cheng posted a Weibo at the same time, with a picture of his hand. On his palm lay a small red silk pouch with gold thread, the background blurred by the focus, only revealing a bright light that was vastly different from the night sky in the domestic area.

Xiao Cheng: Merry Christmas! The brave youth has created a miracle! [smiling face][photo]



Using one's toes to think, it was clear that Xiao Cheng's Weibo meant that he had passed the audition.

Looking at that Weibo, Wei Zhiren felt like he was the most special person to Xiao Cheng.

Using a secret code only they understood, they openly communicated things under everyone's gaze—it was like… holding hands behind people's backs.

A wave of intense joy and satisfaction washed over Wei Zhiren. Holding the bouquet of roses, he sat on the small sofa in the office, took off his glasses, and covered his burning cheeks.

The floral scent came in, mixed with the cool air from outside.

Wei Zhiren calmed down after a while, listening to the noise outside. After a long time, he brought back his sweaty hands, got up, and went to find the omnipotent Wang Tezhu to ask how to handle the roses.

—He could not just throw them away, right?

Taking them home made him feel that little Ming would spray him with a mouthful of carbonated soda.

After some consideration, the CEO still chose to go to the omnipotent Wang Tezhu.

Given that they could have a free meal, Wang Tezhu's mood seemed quite good.

But this bouquet, with dozens of roses at least, was a bit overwhelming to put in a vase.

After some discussion, they decided to use the roses to decorate the office a little. They would split the bouquet into two or three smaller bouquets and place them in vases around the office, which looked quite pleasant.

Wei Zhiren had a strange sense of satisfaction, as if the whole world was watching him show off his love.

President Wei picked out nine roses and, following the guidance of a young woman who had stayed back to work, carefully cut the stems at an angle and placed them in a vase filled with water.

It was a rare opportunity to take revenge on his boss. The group of people, exhausted from overtime, quickly decided on a place for their late-night snack and set off with renewed energy.

Wei Zhiren had no objections to this.

When he left the building, he turned to look at the red roses scattered around the office and on the desks, pushed his glasses up, and his lips curved into a smile that he could not suppress.

President Wei was in a good mood.

Anyone with a bit of discernment could tell.

Wei Zhiren was a good boss. To be honest, although the overtime in Weicheng was indeed severe, in terms of benefits, welfare, and work atmosphere, it was hard to find a place better than Weicheng.


Chapter 55:
Wei Zhiren, though his appearance was strikingly aloof, his employees knew that he could make jokes and rarely got angry—except when the planning proposal turned into a chaotic mess, at which point President Wei's demeanor would plummet to an unusually low point. Otherwise, he was surprisingly amiable.

Therefore, during meals, many people toasted to Wei Zhiren, attempting to draw information about his partner out of him while they ate.

Wei Zhiren had a poor tolerance for alcohol, and there were no close friends around, so he drank with great restraint.

As for those who tried to extract information from him overtly or covertly, they inevitably fell short against President Wei's perpetually indifferent expression.

Wei Zhiren glanced at Wang Tezhu, who was seated beside him.

”Stop drinking,“ he reminded him.

Wang Tezhu, who had only taken a sip of his first cup, was taken aback, ”Ah?“

President Wei pressed Wang Tezhu's glass down and replaced it with tea, saying, ”Later, you will be responsible for safely escorting the ladies home.“

Wang Tezhu: ”…“

President Wei added, ”I am not suitable for that task, you understand.“

Indeed, it was not suitable.

Wang Tezhu took a sip of tea, looking at the wildly excited male colleagues around the table, feeling like a humble little cabbage in the field.

Wei Zhiren also poured himself a cup of tea, declined all the toasts, and quietly picked up his chopsticks to eat and drink.

To sober up.

President Wei looked at the bustling table and seemed to realize he had not sent a message to Xiao Cheng that day. He then took out his phone.

As the screen lit up, it displayed only the time, with nothing else.

Nine o'clock in the evening.

It would be the middle of the night in LA, M Country.

Wei Zhiren paused for a moment, opened Weibo, and glanced at a photo Xiao Cheng had posted an hour ago, raising an eyebrow.

It was clearly the middle of the night, yet why was he posting a daytime photo?

President Wei opened QQ, looked at Doctor Monkey's profile for a long time, and then closed it.

He was probably sleeping at this hour, so it was better not to disturb him.

President Wei leaned his face on his palm, looking at the noisy colleagues at the table, feeling rather bored as he began to browse the forums.

Wang Tezhu glanced at the screen beside President Wei, shocked by the overwhelming pinkness.

He couldn't help but ask, ”President Wei, what are you looking at?“

”Forum,“ President Wei replied without lifting his head, refreshing the page. When he saw a post that had been pushed to the top, he paused slightly.

He glanced at the people at the table, tapping lightly on the table with his fingertips, ”It seems we missed someone from the entertainment department?“

Wang Tezhu raised his hands to clarify that it wasn't his fault, ”I notified them, they said they had an emergency and couldn't come.“

An emergency?

Wei Zhiren looked at the post on his phone.

It was indeed an emergency.

【Rational Discussion】Is the recent highly publicized movie emperor's newly posted Weibo photo implying something?

No.1 This melon is not sweet

As the title suggests, the screenshot is here: [Weibo screenshot]

No censorship, just stating facts, do people with eyes not see the implication of this Christmas greeting?

Given that the movie emperor has been frequently making an appearance after terminating his contract with Light and Shadow, my intuition tells me he is up to something again, first seeking psychological shadow from Weicheng PR Department.

And the last time they managed to dig out the background of those six pineapple cakes was in a famous mountain on the outskirts of B City, now again seeking the story behind this movie emperor's Weibo photo from the omnipotent Rabbit Zone 818.

Old Uncle Hai on the other side has already dug it up, don't just focus on Rabbit Zone.

It was confirmed that Cheng Cheng is not in the country, a fellow netizen posted on Weibo this morning saying she saw me Cheng on MOF Street in LA, with photos and Weibo as proof: [Image][Image]

And the scroll in the photo of me Cheng is probably the one from the temple on the famous mountain on the outskirts of B City where the scroll was placed for divination, without definite evidence, it is inferred from the location of the previous six pineapple cakes and some local fellow netizens’ guesses, as follows: [Image]

No.43 = =

F*ck Liang Jingjing?!

MOF Street? I just went there for a stroll yesterday! I am so angry!

Why did Cheng Cheng go there, hasn't the vacation ended yet, didn't he just announce his participation in Director Xu's new film?

Industry insiders say yes, last week they saw Xiao Cheng and Director Xu trying out for the male and female lead roles in the new film, but it seems the whole batch was wiped out, Director Xu was furious.

So the question is, why did Xiao Cheng go to MOF Street when he had work, sightseeing?

No.46 = =

I want to know what scroll Cheng Cheng is seeking 2333

Does anyone from B City have firsthand experience to say if it is effective? Looking at Weibo, it seems like the wish was fulfilled?

……

No.120 = =

Someone from B City has firsthand experience, saying it is very effective.

But the temple has no name, and when you seek a scroll, they don't interpret it for you, only telling you if it is auspicious or ominous, not letting you see the scroll text, putting the scroll in a scroll box for you to take home, and repeatedly warning you not to open it.

As far as I know, those who opened it all said it was a scam, those who didn't open it thought it was quite effective……

No.121 = =

Wow, it looks so mysterious!

No.122 = =

Another question arises, what could make Xiao Cheng go seek a scroll?

And go all the way to M Country when he had work.

No.123 = =

It's not that I am too sensitive…

Something that could make Xiao Cheng so nervous to seek a scroll, if described as a miracle, could it be that he…

That's right. I, Cheng, said a year ago when I was interviewed that I'm still acting purely to repay my fans.

Otherwise, why would someone who's already a frequent guest on the big screen still go to shoot TV dramas? Just because there are more episodes, allowing us to see his face more often!

He doesn't give a damn about you Blackies; he doesn't rely on you for anything!

Pah pah pah, how is he supposed to do what he wants according to you?!

Scram, scram, scram! Roll away without stopping, day and night!

Number 347 = =

In any case, I wish the OP and all you Blackie chickens a prosperous Year of the Rooster.

Thank you for your years of blind praise; you must have worked so hard.

…

Wei Zhiren looked up at the table of people leaning in all directions and lowered his eyes to open QQ.

Zhiren Zhiren: You can do it, Doctor Monkey. Did you get the audition pass message yesterday?

Zhiren Zhiren: You didn't even tell me!

Mr. President immediately received a reply.

Little Black Monkey: Yes, so did President Wei prepare any rewards for the brave young man who created a miracle?

Little Black Monkey: Like offering himself in marriage, for example :)))



Wei Zhiren scrolled through the post again.

People who understood could tell that someone was setting the tone, even in the linked posts on other large forums.

Otherwise, how could so much detailed information be gathered in just over an hour?

However, there were more spectators taking things in stride.

After slightly deleting some crucial true or false messages, the curiosity of the spectators was piqued even more.

Wei Zhiren checked the entertainment forums on various websites and found that there were indeed posts tearing apart Xiao Cheng's new Weibo and guessing the implications.

No wonder no one from the entertainment department came to work overtime; there was too much to watch and no time for mischief.

At this rate, it seemed the company allowed Xiao Cheng to do some sneak promotions.

No wonder his daytime photo was only posted now, giving the entertainment department half a day to prepare, which is why these posts quickly occupied the top headlines on major portals.

Wei Zhiren thought about how Xiao Cheng promised to inform him in advance the next time he caused trouble, and it seemed he truly did communicate with the entertainment department in advance this time.

But he didn't tell him about it, which was very bad.

Mr. President pursed his lips, opened and closed the input bar on his phone several times, and finally just sent three words to Xiao Yindi.

Zhiren Zhiren: Go to sleep [Petting Dog Head.gif]

Little Black Monkey: No, what about the reward?

Zhiren Zhiren: …

Zhiren Zhiren: [I'll give my little heart to Cheng Cheng today.jpg]

Zhiren Zhiren: Here, reward ↑

Little Black Monkey: …

Xiao Yindi momentarily doubted whether President Wei loved him.

Little Black Monkey: Although it's a bit insincere, I'll reluctantly accept it :)

Little Black Monkey: Goodnight.

Wei Zhiren replied with goodnight, prepared to put away his phone, but thought better of it and opened WeChat to send the bouquet of roses Xiao Cheng gave him to his brother.

Wei Zhiren: Xiao Cheng sent it [Heart]

Wei Ming: …

Wei Ming: What are you showing me this for?

Wei Zhiren: To show you Xiao Cheng's sincerity in pursuing me, and maybe when you'll accept this little sister-in-law [Well-behaved.jpg]

Wei Ming: You? Little sister-in-law? [Question Mark Question Mark Question Mark.jpg]

Wei Ming: Are you kidding me today? Did you take the wrong medicine?

Wei Zhiren: ?

Wei Ming: Also, if you can show off to me, you can show off to our parents!

Wei Zhiren: No! I'm scared!

Wei Zhiren: What if Mom, whose brain isn't quite right, learns from TV dramas to give Xiao Cheng money to leave me?

Wei Ming: Oh, that's possible [What can I do, I'm just a cute national treasure.jpg]

Wei Zhiren: Brother, you're my real brother.

Wei Ming: No way, you're not dating your real brother. You need to talk to Xiao Cheng about winning over the parents.

Wei Zhiren glanced at the table of people still preparing to go to the roadside barbecue, said goodbye to Wang, the assistant, and left first, paying the bill.

In fact, although Wei Zhiren felt that Xiao Cheng's future was unfair to him, in his heart, he was looking forward to it.

The future Xiao Cheng described, where they could walk hand in hand in front of everyone, introducing each other as partners, made Wei Zhiren imagine something beautiful and unrealistic.

Since Xiao Cheng had already proposed such a future, Wei Zhiren was willing to try with him to see if it could come true.

Wei Zhiren's parents were not rigid; they cared far less about Wei Zhiren than about Wei Ming. Wei Ming's statement that Wei Zhiren could come out after his marriage without much resistance was entirely true.

Wei Zhiren didn't doubt it.

What Mr. President was more worried about was Xiao Cheng's situation.

Xiao Cheng came from a military background and had always hoped to inherit his family's legacy.

Instead, Xiao Cheng went and became an actor without a word, deviating from the family's plans by a million miles. If not for his efforts later in shooting the upper-level designated blockbusters, Xiao Cheng wouldn't have gotten a good face at home.

If Xiao Cheng were to come out now…

Wei Zhiren could guess the chaos would be immense.

But to Mr. President's surprise, after Xiao Yindi returned from abroad, he didn't go to the company, ignore the online chaos between the fans and detractors, or inform anyone he was back. Instead, he directly met with Wei Ming and reached some undisclosed agreement with him.

In a sense, he proved with actual actions that he valued Wei Zhiren more than his acting career.

Xiao Cheng was a person with strong action capabilities. Knowing the problem, he wouldn't leave it unresolved.

Especially since it concerned his future happiness, there was no reason to delay solving it.

While Xiao Cheng and Wei Ming were having their secretive meeting, Wei Zhiren was still arguing with the PR department about why his name wasn't on the list for the lottery to visit the new headquarters.

The head of the PR department felt exhausted.

”Mr. Wei, even if you won, you couldn't go as a fan to visit the new headquarters.“

Wei Zhiren: ”…“

That wasn't the same as not being selected or being invited but refusing to attend!

Mr. President was still a bit upset.

His company's lottery couldn't be rigged, which was disappointing.

In contrast to Wei Zhiren's gloomy mood, the dozens of fans who were already packing their bags to meet the god of the universe and get close to him were excited.

Less than a week after Christmas was the New Year's holiday.

After greeting Wei Zhiren, Xiao Yindi took Liu Xiaomai and drove to the newly completed headquarters in Weicheng.


Chapter 57:
A group of girls of varying ages descended from the car rented by the Defense City. The first thing they saw was Xiao Cheng and Liu Xiaomai standing behind the hall door, sheltering from the wind and whispering to each other.

The fans were immediately agitated, and one of the girls who was livestreaming with her phone dropped it to the ground as her hand trembled.

It was not surprising that they were so excited. Not to mention that fans of other celebrities would cry and even faint at the sight of steaming food, their current ability to restrain themselves to mere screams was already quite controlled.

This was because Xiao Cheng had participated in very few activities interacting with fans over the past few years.

Of course, this also had something to do with the fact that variety shows were not popular during the early years of Xiao Cheng's fame.

Later, when Xiao Cheng's career stabilized, he still showed no particular enthusiasm for running on variety shows to gain popularity, at most participating in programs for promotional purposes.

Therefore, when Xiao Cheng said that he would accompany the fans to tour the new headquarters of Defense City, it was indeed a very precious opportunity for those lucky enough to be selected.

The head of the film and television department led the group of girls, standing in rows, into the new building of Defense City headquarters, much like a teacher leading a field trip for elementary school students.

As they walked, the head of the department repeatedly informed the girls, who were taking photos—especially those snapping pictures of Xiao Cheng—that the building would be operational in another month. The materials used for decoration were of high quality and would not pose any harm to the artists.

Hearing the noise, Xiao Cheng and Liu Xiaomai walked over directly.

The girls instantly abandoned the head of the department and turned to surround Xiao Cheng, the Emperor of Drama.

Xiao Cheng took photos with each girl one by one, looking at the stack of notebooks in their arms and purses, he sighed deeply, ”Let's sign as we walk? This is my first time here, and I still want to take a good look around.“

The fans looked at each other and finally lined up obediently, following the head of the department as they toured the new headquarters of Defense City while signing autographs for Xiao Cheng and discreetly asking him some questions.

Xiao Cheng answered their questions with great patience.

”The owner of Defense City is a friend I have known for many years. There is no need to worry.“

However, the girls still expressed deep concern.

”I am already a woman in my late twenties.“

Xiao Cheng felt helpless facing the girls’ worries, but his smile remained gentle.

He spoke softly, ”Have a little confidence in my judgment of people.“

There was no point in continuing this conversation.

The girls looked at each other and finally, it was the girl who had been livestreaming who stepped forward, slightly cautiously.

”Then, Xiao Cheng, is the speculation online about you going to the M country for auditions… true?“

”Hmm?“

Xiao Cheng had not expected this question to be raised by his fans before the journalists did.

”The resources Defense City has given me are very good.“

Xiao Cheng did not answer his fans’ question directly but instead praised Wei Zhenzhen's company first.

After the praise, Xiao Cheng, the Emperor of Drama, winked at the camera, a smile playing on his face.

”Besides, when have I ever disappointed my fans?“

The moment Xiao Cheng finished speaking, the comments in the livestream exploded.

Hmmm: Ahhhhhh! Take a screenshot first! Is this Cheng admitting it!?

It's Cheng Brother, Not Chengge Brother: My my my my, my God! I'm going downstairs to run a few laps! I'm going to cryyyyyyyyy!

Chengtianyan: Ahhhhhhhhhh, quickly ask which production it is! I'm so excited!

Chengmeihua: Oh my God, no wonder you signed with Defense City, a company you've never heard of, without hesitation! The resources are really good! After so many years, I finally see Chengcheng making a big step forward. I'm crying in front of my computer!

Jenny Transdimensional Love for Chengcheng: Same here, thank you, Defense City, for giving me Chengcheng's gift package wuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwu Defense City! Ahhhhh Defense City owner is so good to me, Chengcheng! He must be a very good friend! Compared to the previous company...

Xiao Cheng's girlfriend: Emma, don't mention the previous company, it's unlucky. The president of Light and Shadow, Xu, has been in a lot of lawsuits recently and is very unlucky. It seems that people who were harmed by him before have come forward, waiting for the final verdict. ┐(´▽｀)┌ Don't mention him, it's unlucky. A person's fate is determined by their actions. Let me lick Chengcheng's face!

Hmmm: Defense City forever! Praise Defense City!

Xiao Cheng was unaware of what was happening in the livestream. After dropping the bomb, he calmly withdrew his gaze, signing the notebooks handed to him by the girls, and walked around with the head of the film and television department, touring the new headquarters of Defense City.

Wei Zhenzhen, who was engrossed in overtime work, did not pay attention to the livestream either.

As the year-end approached, even the New Year's Day holiday could not provide a break. While everyone outside was celebrating joyfully, a small part of Defense City's staff was working overtime until they were on the verge of fainting.

Wei Zhenzhen hung up the call from the film and television department, slumped on his desk, feeling that he wanted to vomit every time he saw his phone or computer.

Mr. President looked at the pitch-black sky outside the window and, after a while, decided not to treat himself too harshly during the New Year's Day holiday.

—At least don't work overtime until nine or ten in the evening.

With this thought, Mr. President tidily put the remaining stack of documents aside, picked up his phone and coat, and declared that he was off work.

Wei Father and Wei Mother finally ended their two-month honeymoon before the New Year and returned home.

When Wei Zhenzhen pushed open the door and smelled the smell of kelp and pork ribs soup, he was momentarily confused before he realized.

Wei Mother was best known for making kelp and pork ribs soup.

Wei Zhenzhen stood at the entrance, bewildered, and only came to his senses after his mother called him. Slowly changing his clothes, he even placed the teddy bear slippers, which he had not put away since Xiao Cheng's visit, back in the closet.

”Happy New Year!“ Wei Zhenzhen bounced to the dining room, greeting his brother and father, then shamelessly snuggled next to his mother, ”Although I didn't order my meal, I believe my dear mother must have made it for me!“

Wei Mother served Wei Zhenzhen a bowl of soup and then coldly replied, ”No!“

”…Oh.“ Wei Zhenzhen pursed his lips, ”Then I'll go make myself some noodles.“

The drinking motions of the three people at the table paused.

Wei Ming looked at his younger brother, sighed silently, then lowered his eyes and continued to blow on his soup.

Wei Father and Wei Mother looked at each other and then at their eldest son, who remained unmoved.

Wei Mother put down her bowl and stopped her youngest son from getting up to go to the kitchen.

”Zhenzhen, wait a moment.“

Wei Zhenzhen stopped and looked at his mother, confused, ”What's wrong?“

Wei Mother asked, ”Are you cooking your own noodles?“

Wei Zhenzhen nodded, ”Yeah, didn't they not cook my meal?“

Wei Zhenzhen understood. Since everyone in the family had the habit of not leaving leftovers, they usually cooked only as much as they ate to avoid making too much and feeling uncomfortable from overeating.

So, he had not mentioned in advance that he would be coming home to eat. It was normal that there was no meal for him.

But Wei Zhenzhen did not understand why his father and mother looked as if they had seen a ghost.

”You've never cooked your own noodles before!“ Wei Mother looked at her second son, ”Worst case, you can wash the dishes.“

Wei Zhenzhen carefully considered whether he had indeed been that lazy before and sadly realized that he had.

Mr. President hesitated for a moment, ”But you didn't cook my meal… And there was always a housekeeper before, why do I need to cook my own noodles now?“

”You would rather eat only vegetables than have no meal before,“ Wei Mother stated matter-of-factly, puzzled by her second son's sudden change, ”Did something happen to you?“

Wei Zhenzhen himself was unaware, looking blankly, ”What could happen to me? Do I count as something when I lose weight from working overtime?“

When Wei Ming heard this, he looked at his brother and then at his mother, unsure whether he was sympathizing with Xiao Cheng, who seemed to have been completely ignored, or with his mother, who had敏锐ly detected something wrong but was kicked in the teeth for it.

Brother Ming put down his bowl, cleared his throat, ”Mother, you're overthinking. When you two weren't home, Zhenzhen often cooked noodles and porridge by himself.“

…What a pain.

Wei Zhenzhen glanced at his brother strangely but nodded along with Brother Ming's words.

Wei Mother, half-believing, half-disbelieving, released her grip on Wei Zhenzhen, watching his nimble movements in the kitchen as he prepared the noodles, then turned her gaze to Wei Ming.

”Ming, you should know what's going on with Zhenzhen, right?“


Chapter 58:
”Could there be any other way?“ Wei Ziming spoke falsely, wide awake. ”You are merely overthinking, what's wrong with cooking a bowl of noodles? Is it worth doubting this and that?“

Wei Mu frowned, feeling that something was amiss, but looking at the familiar actions of her second son, it indeed did not seem like something that could be cultivated in a short time.

”Oh dear, just pretend he suddenly grew up and became sensible,“ Wei Ziming said after finishing his soup, ladling himself some rice. ”When Xiao Zhen said she would work hard, you also doubted this and that. I'll tell you again, this kind of behavior is very demotivating.“

Wei Mu wanted to say something more, but was silenced by a single sentence from Wei Ziming.

”Oh right, since you both are back, I have something to tell you.“ Wei Ziming put down his bowl and chopsticks, his tone calm. ”I have set my sights on a maiden.“

Wei Zhen had no idea that his elder brother, Xiao Ming, had sacrificed himself to shield him from his mother's gunfire.

When he came out of the kitchen holding his bowl of noodles, the entire dining room atmosphere had become exceedingly harmonious. Wei Fu and Wei Mu looked extremely happy, their faces radiant with joy.

Wei Zhen slurped his noodles, looking at this and that. ”What good thing happened to make you so happy?“

Wei Mu's smile could not be contained. ”Your brother has a girlfriend.“

Wei Zhen inhaled a mouthful of noodles up his nose, choking violently.

After the meal, Wei Zhen was dragged to the study by his elder brother.

Wei Zhen was still reeling from the bombshell his brother had dropped.

Sitting in the boss chair, Xiao Ming looked at his younger brother, Wei Zhen, for a long time, then tapped the desktop of the bookcase. ”Snap out of it.“

Mr. President reacted, plopping down onto a nearby sofa. ”How did you suddenly get a girlfriend?“

”It's not even set in stone yet. If it weren't for shielding you from the gunfire, I wouldn't have planned to say anything.“

As Xiao Ming spoke, he scrutinized his younger brother seriously.

Then he scoffed derisively. ”You are indeed a lucky fool.“

Wei Zhen: ”……“

?

Was I just subjected to a personal attack from Xiao Ming?

Xiao Ming, who had attacked his younger brother's person, felt nothing was wrong with it. He held his cup of water and took a sip of warm water, then pursed his lips. ”Xiao Cheng came to see me yesterday.“

Wei Zhen was dumbfounded. ”Why didn't I know about this!?“

Xiao Ming sighed, clicking his tongue twice. ”That's why I said you are a lucky fool.“

Wei Zhen: ”……?“

?

You should know that such personal attacks will hurt the delicate heart of Miss Zhenzhen.

”Xiao Cheng told me about his future plans, his own, and those related to you—along with some matters concerning the two of you.“

Wei Ziming did not elaborate on what Xiao Cheng had told him.

”You are quite remarkable, managing to drag him to sleep on a bridge for an entire night on your first meeting.“

Wei Zhen pounded the table, clearly unhappy. ”Xiao Ming, don't dig up my dark past, I'll tell you!“

Xiao Ming laughed twice, took another sip of warm water, then smacked his lips. ”I think Xiao Cheng is a decent fellow.“

”He is undoubtedly excellent!“ Wei Zhen was particularly proud.

”Yes, especially towards you.“ Wei Ziming stroked his younger brother's head fondly, his face filled with paternal affection. ”After all these years, I can finally rid you of me, it's not easy.“

”Xiao Cheng is also fortunate. If I hadn't already had someone in mind to pursue, I would have definitely chased him away.“

After Xiao Ming finished speaking, the smile on his face was rather subtle.

He paused, his tone carrying a hint of exclamation. ”You two are quite fashionable, actually engaging in online dating.“

Wei Zhen: ”……“

Mr. President pondered seriously.

When put this way… it seemed to be correct.

Xiao Ming's cup spun slowly in his hand. ”He's quite good to you, holding onto your dark and gloomy photo and searching for you for so long without giving up, quite admirable.“

Wei Zhen did not want to hear his elder brother dig up his dark past, feeling extremely ashamed.

He grabbed his elder brother's sleeve. ”So what exactly did he tell you?“

”Hmm, if you beg me, I'll tell you.“ Wei Ziming rested his chin on his palm, looking at his younger brother who was anxiously pleading.

Wei Zhen: ”……“

?

Xiao Ming, you have changed, you were not like this before.

You used to love me!

After enjoying his younger brother's mood swings, Xiao Ming tapped his fingers on the table. ”Alright, I'll reluctantly tell you.“

”When Xiao Cheng came to see me, he said he wouldn't hide your existence; he would announce it to everyone, ensuring you would not suffer any harm. Before that, he would handle the pressure from both sets of parents, that's why he specifically came to seek my help, and…“

Xiao Ming's finger movements paused. ”He also said he would form a family with you.“

Mr. President's mind buzzed. ”W-what does that mean…?“

”It means he wants to marry you.“



He kicked off his slippers, held his phone, and flopped onto the bed, unlocking the screen saver to gaze at the wallpaper.

—that was a photo of him and Xiao Cheng during their vacation at the seaside.

Wei Zhen looked at the two people in the photo, one holding a surfboard, both casually sipping from a drink straw, and could not help but chuckle softly.

Marriage.

Before Wei Ziming uttered those two words, Mr. President had never considered such plans for his future with Xiao Cheng.

To him, being able to stand side by side with Xiao Cheng in front of everyone, calmly introducing each other as partners, was already a sufficiently beautiful scene.

Moreover, domestic laws did not yet recognize same-sex marriages.

Wei Zhen pulled a pillow behind him and hugged it close, opening his QQ.

Zhenzhenzhen: Monkey Doctor, if you throw bombs without warning again, you'll lose my [Grudge.jpg]

Mr. President did not wait for Emperor Xiao's reply.

Because Emperor Xiao called directly.

Mr. President answered the call, rolling two times on the bed with the pillow in his arms.

”You this rascal! You actually have the courage to call your master!“

Emperor Xiao: ”……“

?

What new character trait have you secretly added to yourself, you actor?

Emperor Xiao remained silent for a long time, glancing upwards at the director and the crew discussing props and lighting. He threw the empty box meal into the trash bin and walked to a sheltered area outside the photography studio.

”Angry?“ Xiao Cheng asked.

Mr. President rubbed his nose, slightly indignant about Emperor Xiao's sudden decision to secretly meet his parents without warning.

But thinking about what Xiao Cheng had said to his elder brother, a sweet and dizzying sourness welled up in his heart.

Wei Zhen buried his head in the pillow, his voice muffled. ”Yes, I was so angry I couldn't sleep.“

Emperor Xiao heard the muffled voice with a slight nasal twang and frowned. ”Your voice is off, did you catch a cold?“

”No.“ Mr. President lifted his face. ”Monkey Doctor, you have to take care of putting me to sleep.“

”…“ Xiao Cheng could not help but glance at his watch. ”It's only eight o'clock at night.“

”Rising with the sun and retiring with the sunset is the healthiest lifestyle!“ Mr. President lifted his leg, pinching the pillow between his thighs, then pulled another pillow onto the bed and hugged it close.

”Are you going to put me to sleep or not!“

His domineering attitude seemed to pass through the phone, vividly displaying itself before Xiao Cheng.

”Why put you to sleep?“ Emperor Xiao spoke coldly and mercilessly. ”Why not let the emperor accompany his imperial concubine to sleep instead, ensuring you'll sleep soundly in the second half of the night?“

Wei Zhen, hearing this, nearly dropped the phone as he could not catch his breath.

”You this rascal!“ Mr. President described his agitation. ”Who wants to sleep with you!“

Stop being cryptic and driving a hearsay truck!

Don't you fear this article being reported and locked?

Emperor Xiao laughed twice on the other end of the line. ”If you can sleep with my life-sized pillow, why can't you sleep with me?“

Wei Zhen: ”……“

Damn.

Xiao Ming, you betrayed me!

Wei Zhen seemed to have completely forgotten that he had already exposed to Xiao Cheng that he had a pillow of his, and without hesitation, directly blamed Xiao Ming.

After all, Xiao Ming's back was already laden with all sorts of colorful and styled pots, he wouldn't mind one more!

Mr. President poked the soft pillow in his arms one by one, coolly shifting the topic.

”Why didn't you tell me before secretly meeting Xiao Ming? I was terrified when I was dragged to the study, didn't you tell me?“

Emperor Xiao saw an opportunity to retreat, noticing Wei Zhen's change of topic, and followed suit.


Chapter 59:
Mr. Shadow King leaned against the wall of the photography studio, his face wearing an unmistakably amused smile.

Xiao Cheng said, ”Because we really are a little princess.“

”… Ah?“

What?

Mr. President looked utterly bewildered.

Mr. Shadow King spoke in an odd, lyrical tone, ”The little princess sits in the castle, waiting for the knight to clear the thorns and remove the obstacles to come and marry you.“

Wei Zhiren said, in his heart, why should it be you marrying me, but he could not suppress his smile.

He hugged two pillows and rolled over, saying with a mouthful of words, ”What you said, I haven't agreed to yet, Doctor Monkey.“

Mr. Shadow King had heard this phrase countless times in recent days.

So he paid no heed and even joked, ”I have already felt your intentions; it makes no difference whether you agree or not.“

Wei Zhiren harrumphed.

In fact, he really wanted to ask Xiao Cheng about his plans for marriage—once he had such thoughts, Wei Zhiren could not help imagining himself marrying Xiao Cheng under the blessings of family and friends, forming a family.

But he felt that it would seem too eager to ask now.

Mr. President tossed and turned in bed,纠结.

Xiao Cheng listened to the rustling sounds on the other end of the phone and asked softly, ”Not angry anymore?“

Wei Zhiren responded vaguely.

”Unfortunately, my schedule is too full; I won't be able to sleep with you recently,“ Mr. Shadow King's tone was filled with regret.

Mr. President thought of the schedule Mr. Wang, the assistant president, had given him earlier that day, the full schedule, and could not help being sarcastic, ”Yes, that's truly a pity.“

Mr. Shadow King raised an eyebrow, ”Are you suggesting that I should squeeze in time to raid you at night, my true love?“

”No, you're thinking too much, my Cheng,“ Wei Zhiren sat up, walked into the bathroom, placed his phone aside, turned on speaker mode, and started squeezing toothpaste, ”I remember you have something to do tonight?“

”Yes, I'm changing the set,“ Xiao Cheng heard the sound of water and the clinking of a glass cup.

”Work hard, Doctor Monkey, for you bear the future of Weicheng!“ Wei Zhiren said and then stuffed the toothbrush into his mouth.

Wei Zhiren chatted aimlessly with Xiao Cheng about all sorts of topics while brushing his teeth, until he finished his bedtime preparations and snuggled into bed, hearing Xiao Cheng's call from the other end.

It was Liu Xiaomai calling Xiao Cheng to prepare for filming.

Wei Zhiren lay in the soft, warm bed, speaking in a monotone as if reading from a script, ”You have to work hard and seriously to earn your living, Mr. Shadow King.“

Mr. Shadow King laughed out loud, ”Alright, work hard and earn money for you.“

Mr. President was satisfied, his tail wagging in triumph, ”Good boy.“

”Rest well,“ Mr. Shadow King sighed, ”Goodnight.“

…

Xiao Cheng's schedule was indeed very full.

Full to the point that he felt as if he had traversed time, returning to ten years ago when he was following production teams, mooching food and drinks everywhere.

Mr. Shadow King had just finished shooting a public service advertisement, looked up at the pitch-black sky.

He checked his watch again, it was ten o'clock at night.

Mr. Shadow King turned to look at his agent, asking, ”Do I have any rest scheduled after this?“

The agent looked up in surprise, ”You actually want to rest?“

Xiao Cheng was puzzled, ”Why can't I want to rest?“

”Because your persona includes the tag of a workaholic,“ Liu Xiaomai rolled her eyes, ”But I doubt that you or Mr. Wei or even yourself have forgotten this persona.“

Oh.

He had indeed forgotten.

Xiao Cheng had long considered that he now had money and goals other than acting, so it was unnecessary to be obsessed with acting and gradually become thinner.

So after a month of being busy, as the New Year's Eve approached without a single rest day, Mr. Shadow King, who had been working tirelessly for his lifelong happiness, was somewhat unhappy.

He completely abandoned his persona as a workaholic.

And he really wanted to see Mr. President, who was equally busy, to touch his little hand, say some sweet nothings, and perhaps coax an oral promise from him to be with him—then kiss and hug him.

Mr. Shadow King's heart was restless.

However, Liu Xiaomai did not notice the restlessness in Xiao Cheng's heart at all. She opened her notebook, ”Director Xu's new film will start shooting after the New Year, and after that, you'll fly to Kangaroo Country, where your scenes are scheduled to start in June this year. After that, you'll have to follow Director Xu for promotion, and your previous lead role film was invited to the festival…“

Liu Xiaomai listed Xiao Cheng's work schedule, ”Until the New Year's Eve next year, your work is fully scheduled, with perhaps a few days of rest squeezed in here and there.“

Mr. Shadow King was stunned by the full work schedule, ”It's not even New Year's Eve yet.“

Liu Xiaomai nodded, ”Yes.“

Xiao Cheng remained silent for a while, then asked, ”Xiaomai, do you think I came to Weicheng for what?“

Liu Xiaomai looked at Mr. Shadow King with a puzzled expression, ”Could it be because Weicheng has good resources and benefits, and they even promote you?“

Mr. Shadow King looked at his agent, ”What misunderstanding do you have of me?“

Liu Xiaomai looked interrogatively.

”I came to Weicheng to pursue my lifelong happiness,“ Mr. Shadow King glanced at the notebook in his agent's hand, emphasizing, ”I didn't come to work!“

Liu Xiaomai: ”…“

You!

You are really!

Can't you have a bit of the Shadow King's dignity?

Would you dare to say this in front of Mr. President?

Xiao Cheng indicated that he had nothing to fear.

Liu Xiaomai took a deep breath and said earnestly, ”These resources are all related to the future direction and image of Weicheng.“

”Mr. President is the boss of Weicheng, isn't contributing to Weicheng also benefiting Mr. President?“

The agent pleaded, ”Moreover, you have to know that Weicheng is still new to the industry, although well-funded, it hasn't fully opened up the market within the industry yet, all of which depends on you—would you not hope to see the largest investment in Weicheng fall on you, only to not even make a ripple?“

Mr. Shadow King frowned.

He understood the reasoning, but with his work schedule full to the brim, leaving him no time to see Mr. President, he felt it was too much.

The agent looked at the seemingly indifferent Shadow King.

Finally, he put away his amiable expression and coldly revealed his trump card, ”Most of these works are arranged by Mr. President after his review, are you going to do them or not?“

Xiao Cheng choked on air, staring at Liu Xiaomai for a long time.

”… I will.“

Author's Note: Wei Zhiren: I'm going to report that someone is driving a hearse here! [Suddenly Excited.jpg]

Xiao Cheng: … [Anti-Idiot Liquid.jpg]



Many migrant workers followed the tide of returning home, leaving the big city made of steel and concrete gradually quiet.

But for those in the entertainment industry, every holiday was their busiest time.

Especially during the year-end.

Weicheng's investment department had already closed for the holidays, but the entertainment department was still working around the clock.

As the boss, Wei Zhiren was naturally not exempt.

Even Wei Ziming, who was usually very busy, had a rare holiday today. He got up early and knocked on the door of his brother, who worked on New Year's Eve.

The President, who had just woken up and was putting on clothes, poked his head out of his sweater and casually replied.

Zhiming big brother pushed open the door, seeing his brother rummaging through the closet for an overcoat, holding a cup of hot coffee, sipping it leisurely, and asked, ”Are you going home for the New Year?“

Going home for the New Year, naturally meant returning to his hometown to visit his grandparents who did not want to leave.

Wei Zhiren's grandparents had lost their parents early, so when the family said they were going home, it could only mean his grandparents’ home.

Wei Zhiren's father came from the countryside, became successful in his career, and married a good wife, always a source of pride for his grandparents.

More accurately, a source of pride for the entire village.

When Wei Ziming was born, his grandparents were very happy, especially after Wei Ziming turned out to be obedient and studious, they liked him even more.

Later, when it came to Wei Zhiren, he was a naughty and mischievous little grandson who did not like studying.

With Wei Ziming's excellence before him, Wei Zhiren, who was illiterate and liked to roam around, naturally did not please his grandparents.

There was no such thing as the youngest child being the most favored.


Chapter 60:
Because of the resentment he faced every time he returned, Wei Zhiren always resisted going back to his hometown during the New Year.

Over time, the entire family grew accustomed to his wishes.

This year, Wei Zhiren's response remained the same: he would not go.

He did not wish to return to his hometown where he was constantly criticized and nitpicked; he did not possess any peculiar or unusual preferences.

”I won't go. I'll buy a bunch of frozen dumplings and noodles when I get off work today.“

Wei Zhiren had long maintained the habit of ordering takeout or eating frozen foods during the New Year, and he would go to bed very early each year.

There was no one at home, and the Spring Festival Gala was too boring.

Their residential area did not allow fireworks, leaving no trace of the New Year's atmosphere. Wei Zhiren could only treat New Year's Eve as an ordinary night and go to bed early to sleep.

Xiaoming, looking at his younger brother Zhiren in his coat, took a sip of coffee, ”Then where are you going?“

”I'm not going anywhere?“ Wei Zhiren looked at his brother in confusion, ”Every year, I've celebrated this way.“

Xiaoming thought for a moment, ”Why don't you go to Xiao Cheng?“

Wei Zhiren: ”……“

?

Xiaoming Brother, are you switching roles too quickly?

Mr. President examined his elder brother with a strange expression, ”Xiao Cheng has been very busy lately.“

Xiaoming laughed, adopting an air of a mastermind, ”That's not necessarily true. If you say you want to spend the New Year with him, he will definitely squeeze out his vacation to be with you.“

Wei Zhiren was taken aback, pursed his lips, and put on his coat before leaving the room, ”Alright, I'll ask.“

The result of Mr. President's inquiry was that Xiao Yindi wholeheartedly agreed and indeed squeezed out two days of vacation.

This time, when Wei Zhiren's mother left, she did not worry about him starving at home as she had in previous years.

In the past, Wei Zhiren's mother always tried to send him to another family for the New Year. Each time, Wei Zhiren would casually agree that he would go, and his mother would leave for the hometown feeling reassured.

This time, knowing that Wei Zhiren could cook noodles himself, Wei Zhiren's mother left without a second thought, not even turning back.

Wei Zhiren watched them leave and soon after, packed a few pieces of clothing and toiletries. After work, he drove to Xiao Cheng's place eagerly.

Mr. President was in high spirits, and when Xiao Yindi opened the door, he saw a radiant smile on his face.

When Wei Zhiren arrived at Xiao Cheng's place, it was already late on New Year's Eve.

Xiao Yindi had bought a lot of New Year's goods and hung many red decorations filled with festive atmosphere in the house.

Wei Zhiren threw his bag to the side, flopped onto the lazy sofa in the living room, rolled around, and looked at Xiao Cheng standing by, ”Doctor Monkey, I haven't celebrated the New Year with others in a long time.“

Xiao Yindi was taken aback, clearly not expecting such a statement.

”Because I'm not someone else's child, I have always been resented,“ Wei Zhiren sat up, crossed his legs, and counted on his fingers, ”It's been almost nine years, my grandparents have always resented me, wishing my parents had never given birth to me, so I don't go home during the New Year to cause trouble.“

Xiao Yindi, who often remained anonymous in the entertainment industry, instantly understood the meaning of Wei Zhiren's words.

”You are very capable,“ Xiao Cheng pulled Wei Zhiren up, not intending to elaborate on the topic but asking, ”Do you want to help prepare the New Year's Eve dinner?“

”Two people having a New Year's Eve dinner?“ Wei Zhiren leaned casually against Xiao Cheng without a care, grinning, ”Doctor Monkey is truly considerate.“

Xiao Cheng glanced at Mr. President, ”Not in a good mood?“

Wei Zhiren was silent for a moment, then sighed deeply, straightened up, and touched his face, ”Is it obvious?“

”No, it's not obvious,“ Xiao Yindi pulled Mr. President towards the kitchen, ”But I make my living by acting.“

Which means Wei Zhiren's acting was not up to par, so Xiao Yindi could see right through him.

”It's not that I'm very unhappy; I just feel they only like Xiaoming…“ Wei Zhiren paused, pursed his lips, ”I'm not bad either. Although I can't compare to Xiaoming, I now have my own career. Why do they always talk to me as if I owe them a well-behaved grandson?“

”You are indeed far from Xiaoming,“ Xiao Cheng said matter-of-factly.

Wei Zhiren clenched his clothes, glaring at Xiao Yindi.

”But I like you,“ Xiao Cheng smiled, rubbing Mr. President's head, ”In this regard, Xiaoming can't catch up to you.“

”Who, who cares if you like me?“ Wei Zhiren hesitated for a moment but did not dodge Xiao Cheng's hand, instead asking, ”What are we having for dinner tonight?“

Xiao Yindi thought for a moment about the ingredients in the kitchen and said, ”It depends on what you cook.“

Wei Zhiren immediately spotted the live shrimp in the basket.

Mr. President took the shrimp without hesitation, ”I want those! Boiled! With soy sauce!“

Xiao Yindi rolled up his sleeves and agreed, ”Alright.“

The so-called New Year's Eve dinner was not even started by midnight.

Xiao Cheng and Wei Zhiren started eating with chopsticks just past eight, unable to resist their hunger.

Xiao Yindi was busy shelling shrimp for Mr. President, while Mr. President was busy passing dishes to Xiao Yindi.

The Spring Festival Gala, which was always cut short, was playing on TV. Wei Zhiren, munching on shrimp, looked back at the program and sighed, reflecting that after many years, he was celebrating the New Year with someone else, and that someone was a heartthrob.

Xiao Yindi, still shelling shrimp for Mr. President, smiled upon hearing this, then, under Mr. President's glare, also joined in, ”I hope that in the new year, the person I like will agree to my pursuit!“

Wei Zhiren could not help but say, ”Didn't you say you didn't care?“

”How could I not care?“ Xiao Cheng stood up to clean the dishes, ”Instead of worrying about whether I care, why not just agree to me, Mr. President?“

Mr. President helped clean the dishes, looked at Xiao Yindi, and cleared his throat, ”Alright.“

He then placed the dishes on Xiao Yindi's side, ”Then you wash the dishes tonight!“

Xiao Yindi smiled, ”Alright this year.“

Wei Zhiren grumbled but did not speak.

Xiao Yindi held the dishes and cleared his throat, ”In the new year, I hope my partner will sleep with me.“

Wei Zhiren: ”……“

Heartthrob, you're so childish.

Mr. President followed Xiao Yindi into the kitchen, ”It's not impossible…“

Xiao Yindi turned to look at Wei Zhiren, ”Go wash up and wait for me.“

Wei Zhiren: ”……“

Wei Zhiren followed Xiao Cheng, who had finished washing the dishes, into his bedroom.

To be precise, he had never been in


Chapter 61:
Wei Zhiren choked, his face flushed red, and pulled the pillow beside him to cover Xiaoyingdi's face, then grabbed the clothes and slipped into his slippers, clomping into the bathroom.

Xiaoyingdi smiled and shook his head, taking out a hairdryer from the drawer of the bedside table.

When Wei Zhiren came out, he was wearing pajamas emblazoned with a carefree bear, his hair still damp.

Xiaocheng looked up, his gaze sweeping over the carefree bear on the pajamas, waving him over, ”Come here.“

Wei Zhiren glanced at the hairdryer in Xiaoyingdi's hand and sat down in front of Xiaocheng without hesitation.

Xiaoyingdi picked up two magazines and handed them to Mr. President.

”Look, fold the corner of any you like,“ Xiaoyingdi said, pausing for a moment, ”If you can't find any, we'll find a master to custom-make a pair that suits your style.“

Wei Zhiren lowered his head to flip through the magazines, absentmindedly folding a few corners, then looked up to see Xiaocheng kneeling on the bed, straightening his body to blow-dry his hair.

Xiaoyingdi touched Wei Zhiren's short hair, which was quickly dried, feeling the soft, velvety texture.

He set the hairdryer aside, ”What's wrong? Which one do you like?“

Mr. President put the magazine aside and glanced at Xiaoyingdi's clothing.

It was the easiest robe to take off.

Wei Zhiren's face flushed red again, and he turned, tugging at Xiaoyingdi's sleeve, stammering, ”A-Actually, I don't support premarital sex.“

Xiaocheng looked at the shy Wei Zhiren, pulling him into his arms and burying his head in his neck, laughing softly.

”What are you laughing at!“ Wei Zhiren demanded angrily.

”I'm not laughing,“ Xiaocheng immediately retracted his smile, assuming a stern expression, ”Actually, I don't support it either.“

Wei Zhiren: ”……“

No!

Actually, I didn't mean it that way!

Why don't you make a New Year's wish like you did before!

Like wishing that my partner would have sex with me!

Mr. President tugged at Xiaoyingdi's sleeve, feeling rather anxious.

The author had something to say: Wei Zhiren: Why don't you play by the book!?

Xiaocheng: …Blame me?



Because the author said she wouldn't write explicit content.

The next morning, Wei Zhiren snuggled into Xiaocheng's arms, with Xiaoyingdi's broad chest behind him.

Mr. President looked at the edge of the bed he was lying on, feeling the warmth from the body behind him, confirming that it wasn't him who had sought out Xiaocheng for a hug last night, but Xiaocheng who had leaned in.

Oh, I'm a bit shy!

Wei Zhiren reached out from under the covers, grabbed his phone, unplugged the charging cable, opened Xiaoming Brother's profile in WeChat, and began tapping the screen vigorously.

Wei Zhiren: Xiaoming!

Xiaoming: Call me Brother, breakfast time?

Wei Zhiren: Not yet, I'm still in bed, I'm telling you!

Wei Zhiren: I suspect Xiaocheng, he… can't!

Wei Zhiren: I slept with him last night, and he actually didn't do it!

Wei Zhiren: unbelievable![I hugged my little carp.jpg]

Brother Xiaoming, who was peeling an eggshell, saw his brother's message and, unable to catch his breath, dropped the whole egg, which rolled several times on the table before finally falling to the ground.

Xiaoming: ”……“

My breakfast!

Xiaoming: I told you to go home for the New Year, and you ended up spending it in someone else's bed!

Xiaoming: Wei Zhiren, where's your future?

Mr. President was also furious.

Wei Zhiren: My future is in my Cheng! What's wrong with that, huh?

Wei Zhiren: My body, my soul, my bank card, my Alipay—everything is Cheng Cheng's![It looks like my Alipay was emptied.jpg]

Xiaoming: ”……“

Xiaoming: You're right, there's nothing wrong.

Mr. President was even more furious.

Wei Zhiren: So Xiaoming, do you think he really can't? Or maybe he just doesn't like me?

Wei Zhiren: I slept next to him! He even hugged me last night!

Xiaoming: Call me Brother, and I'll tell you.

Wei Zhiren: Brother.

Xiaoming: ”……You… You are…“

Wei Zhiren: ?[Black man question mark.jpg]

Xiaoming felt his brotherly dignity being trampled upon.

Brother Xiaoming threw the egg on the ground into the trash bin and grabbed another one.

Xiaoming: Hey, it's early morning, if you keep pestering him, you won't know if he can or can't.

Wei Zhiren: ”……Damn, Xiaoming, you really get it![Old man cold clap.gif]

Xiaoming: I suspect you might be a girl.

Before Wei Zhiren could continue chatting with his brother, a hand reached behind him and grabbed his phone.

Mr. President was completely bewildered, then quickly turned around to see Xiaoyingdi, who had just woken up, holding his phone and doing something incredibly naughty.

—He was going through the chat history.

Wei Zhiren cursed, struggling fiercely to get his phone back.

However, compared to a hermit like Xiaoyingdi, his struggle was as weak as a kitten kicking its legs, easily suppressed.

Xiaoyingdi raised his leg to pin Mr. President's flailing legs, pulling his arm back, and firmly trapped him in his embrace.

Then, in front of Mr. President, Xiaoyingdi went through the entire chat history.

After reading it, he raised an eyebrow and nudged the two joined hips.

”I can't? Hmm?“

”You, you, you, you can!“ Wei Zhiren's face flushed red.

He quickly snatched back his phone, avoiding Xiaoyingdi's gaze, and buried his face in the other's chest.

Xiaocheng's body temperature was high, warm all over. Due to his frequent workouts, his chest was quite hard. Wei Zhiren pressed himself against Xiaocheng's chest, feeling his face heat up even more.

”You're taking advantage of me early in the morning,“ Xiaoyingdi lowered his head to look at Wei President's face pressed against his chest, sat up, and tidied up his bathrobe, which had become loose after a night's sleep, then pulled out the quickly bundled-up blanket and freed Wei President.

Xiaoyingdi looked at the drenched Mr. President and stood up from the bed, bringing clothes to the bed.

”Stop playing, you have work today.“

Wei Zhiren groggily changed his clothes.

After he was done, he suddenly lifted his head to meet Xiaoyingdi's eyes, who had watched him change his clothes the entire time.

Wei Zhiren: ”…You're taking advantage of me.“

”You also took advantage of me, it's even now,“ Xiaoyingdi said, clearing his throat, and took out a new toothbrush and towel from the drawer.

Wei Zhiren held the toothbrush in his mouth, looking at Xiaoyingdi washing his face in the mirror, and thought of something, taking out the toothbrush and asking.

”Monkey Empress, if I leave, won't you be left alone?“

Xiaocheng looked at Wei Playboy, threw the towel into the basin, and smiled, ”Then can His Majesty let this concubine be your leg accessory for the day and accompany you to handle state affairs?“

His Majesty thought about his full schedule for the day and Xiaocheng's impact on his work efficiency, and shook his head decisively, ”No.“

Xiaocheng was still an actor, so he had much more to do every morning than Wei Zhiren.

By the time Xiaoyingdi came out of the bathroom, he saw Mr. President squatting by the sofa in the living room, searching his backpack.

Xiaoyingdi walked to the kitchen and casually asked, ”Looking for something?“

”Looking for the gift Xiaoming sent me before the New Year,“ Wei Zhiren replied, searching for a while longer, and finally found a crumpled, wrinkled piece of paper in the bottom corner of his backpack.

Wei Zhiren took the paper to the kitchen and solemnly handed it to Xiaocheng.

”It's from Xiaoming, I didn't have time to go, so you go instead, Monkey Empress.“

Monkey Empress gave the crumpled, waste-paper-like thing a cursory glance, fed His Majesty a piece of toast, and then took the wrinkled paper.

Carefully unfolding it, she found it was a Disney乐园 ticket.

Xiaoyingdi: ”……“

You two really never grew up.

Although he thought so inwardly, Xiaoyingdi, who had nothing to do all day, still went to Disney乐园 with the ticket after Mr. President left for work.

Mr. President, who was dizzy and confused after being immersed in state affairs and the secluded palace, sat in the cafeteria eating lunch.

He mechanically and aimlessly bit into his pineapple bun, then casually pulled out his phone to browse Weibo.

Xiaoyingdi's Weibo post from that morning was prominently displayed.


Chapter 62:
That was a photograph of Xiao Cheng and Mickey, taken from a selfie angle.

Xiao Cheng: Ordered to recall childhood. [Image]

Wei Zhiren choked on a pineapple bun caught halfway down his throat, forcing it down with half a glass of milk.

—What the hell does ”ordered“ mean?

Wei Zhiren glanced at the top comments.

Another familiar sock puppet.

Chengcheng's Navel: Ordered? What order? 23333

Xiao Cheng: @Chengcheng's Navel: The boss's order :)

Mr. Wei read the tweet for quite some time before, as usual, liking it and reposting it coldly, signifying that he had read it.

Just two minutes after reposting, Xiao Cheng, the Emperor of Drama who was ordered to recall his childhood, tapped Mr. Wei on QQ.

Little Black Monkey: Taking a rest?

Zhiren Zhiren: …I suspect you've installed a surveillance camera near me. [Face full of fear.jpg]

Little Black Monkey: No, I just quietly followed you. [Blushing.jpg]

Zhiren Zhiren: [You naughty thing.jpg]

Zhiren Zhiren: Queen Monkey, how was your childhood memory? [Gently petting dog head.gif]

Xiao Cheng held a cup of hot cocoa, walked to a chair at the corner of the intersection, sat down, took off his mask, and took a sip before slowly replying.

Little Black Monkey: It was good, but a bit chilly. The wind on my face during the roller coaster ride felt like it could peel my skin off.

Wei Zhiren glanced outside at the weather.

It was rare to see the sun, but the temperature was not high.

Zhiren Zhiren: Doctor Monkey, I hope you cherish your face.

Zhiren Zhiren: After all, it is your greatest advantage. [Sexually狂热的凝视.jpg]

Little Black Monkey: I have many other advantages.

Zhiren Zhiren: Such as? [Tell me your story.jpg]

Little Black Monkey: Such as remaining calm in my embrace.

Zhiren Zhiren: …

Emperor of Drama looked at the string of ellipses from Mr. President and couldn't help but chuckle softly, rubbing his nose and changing the subject.

Little Black Monkey: I put the house key in your bag before I left. I have a flight tonight; I'm going to the filming location with Director Xu to prepare for the shoot.

Wei Zhiren stared at the words ”house key“ for a long time, feeling his face heat up.

After a while, he replied with a piece of bread still in his mouth.

Zhiren Zhiren: I'll come visit the set!

Little Black Monkey: Don't, this time it's in the middle of nowhere, with no signal. You'd have to go to the nearest town to make a call. It's not worth your while.

Zhiren Zhiren: woc… Is Director Xu's new film that scary?

Little Black Monkey: As an actor, I have the awareness to dedicate myself to art.

Zhiren Zhiren: No, you can only dedicate yourself to me.

Little Black Monkey: I'd like to, but someone disapproves of premarital relations.

Zhiren Zhiren: …

Are you addicted to this joke? !

Doctor Monkey, you don't know how easily you can lose me like this!

His Majesty the Emperor decided to ignore this rebellious Queen temporarily. He angrily stuffed his phone into his pocket, drank the remaining milk in one go, and strode back to his office.

Xiao Cheng tapped Wei Zhiren for a long time but couldn't get his attention. He felt helpless yet amused by Wei Zhiren, who was clearly eager to be proactive yet abnormally shy.

”Talk to your girlfriend quickly, don't go acting crazy after the shoot starts.“ Director Xu, who was waiting by Xiao Cheng's side at the airport, had no interest in the sweet expression on the Emperor of Drama's face.

Old man refuses to eat dog food.

”He doesn't talk to me.“ Xiao Cheng was also helpless, taking a photo of the dark night outside the airport, thinking for a while, and then posting a tweet.

Xiao Cheng: Going to a place cut off from the world, remember to think of me. Goodnight. [Image]

Just as he was about to put his phone in his pocket, it vibrated lightly.

A notification for a new special follower message.

Zhiren Zhiren: Goodnight. [Love you] //@Xiao Cheng: Going to a place cut off from the world, remember to think of me. Goodnight. [Image]



Only the two of them understood the hidden sweetness in their exchange.

Wei Zhiren looked at the comments under Xiao Cheng's tweet. The fans were ecstatic, celebrating Xiao Cheng posting two tweets in one day and praising the strategy of Weicheng not restricting its artists from posting on social media.

Look at how Xiao Cheng never did this when he was at Jingying!

Wei Zhiren lay on Xiao Cheng's bed, flipping through Xiao Cheng's tweets again.

Actually, Jingying did not restrict Xiao Cheng's posts on various social media platforms. Xiao Cheng had told Wei Zhiren this himself.

Xiao Cheng did not post many tweets, and even fewer personal ones. This was not because he was aloof and unwilling to connect with his fans or ruin his image.

It was because he was too busy to pay attention to these things.

He had to be cautious of others’ malicious attacks and rumors, and due to his own reasons, he had to rotate between different film sets, leaving him no extra energy for such trivialities.

Initially, Liu Xiaomai handled everything on social media, and as his manager, she could not add any extra layers to Xiao Cheng's persona.

Later, when Xiao Cheng had time to care about his fanbase and social accounts, his aloof image had already been firmly established.

Xiao Cheng was content with this, preferring to潜水 and only resurfacing during holidays or for work promotions.

Recently, he had been posting more frequently because he was in an exceptionally good mood.

—The joy of fulfilling long-held desires was too delightful for even the highly self-controlled Emperor of Drama to suppress his happiness and delight.

Wei Zhiren looked at Xiao Cheng's recent tweets and photos. To someone as close to Xiao Cheng as he was, every picture and post held special, hidden meanings.

Even the photos of him and Xiao Cheng, where he was merely in the background.

I am special.

Xiao Cheng's every move was connected to me.

Xiao Cheng was courting me.

Xiao Cheng was sweet-talking me in front of everyone.

This hidden delight filled Wei Zhiren's heart with a complex taste, like the juice that splashes on your hand when peeling an orange, a mix of bitterness and sweetness, indescribably intricate.

Mr. President threw his phone aside, crawled into bed, and hugged the pillow that Xiao Cheng had slept on the previous night, burying his head and deeply inhaling.

It was Xiao Cheng's scent.

The scent of milk-scented shower gel.

Wei Zhiren buried his head in the pillow, pulling the blanket over himself, wrapping himself and the pillow tightly.

It was all Xiao Cheng's scent.

Mr. President stayed in bed for a while, then lifted his head to take a breath and saw the magazine on the bedside table.

He reached out to take it, and as he opened it, three cards fell out.

Wei Zhiren was stunned, picked up the three cards from the blanket, and found they were business cards.

He recognized the names on the cards, all well-known jewelry designers in the country, with styles he liked.

Half a year ago, Mr. President had asked one of them to design his parents’ wedding anniversary ring, even discussing the three designers‘ styles in depth with Doctor Monkey, who was still a good friend at the time.

Wei Zhiren looked at the stack of magazines and the business cards in his hand, his expression complex.

After a while, he pursed his lips, reinserted the cards into the magazine pages, and burrowed back into bed.

…

The relocation day for Weicheng headquarters was set for the seventh day of the new year.

Before that, some equipment and materials would be moved first.

Wei Zhiren had a relatively light workload during the New Year period, but he was still very busy.

He sat in his office, the door left open for a change.

Because the entire investment department floor was empty.

The equipment and materials had been moved to the new headquarters building, making his office seem somewhat empty as well.

Mr. President propped his chin on his hands in front of the desk, browsing the computer pages absentmindedly. The pen he held was spinning helplessly in Wei Zhiren's hand, unable to fulfill its function.

In fact, if Assistant Wang hadn't taken a break, he would have quickly noticed Wei Zhiren's changes.

Although he still maintained his aloof, cold demeanor on the surface, when he sat alone in his office, he often spaced out, reacting more slowly to reports from others, and his efficiency in handling documents and following up on projects had decreased significantly.

Unfortunately, Assistant Wang was not there.


Chapter 63:
So, the staff of Wei Zhiren's film department, facing the president Wei who appeared expressionless as if in deep thought, still harbored some doubts in their hearts.

Wei Zhiren was thinking.

Thinking about something extremely important.

He was preparing to come out of the closet to his parents as soon as possible—after all, Wei Ziming already had a target, and there was nothing major about informing his parents of his situation.

Wei Zhiren was quite confident in his brother's charm; after all, he was a big boss accustomed to planning ahead.

Daring to say at home that he already had a target meant he was most likely telling the truth.

Wei Zhiren did not believe his brother's nonsense about ”not having crossed the first hurdle yet.“

Wei Zhiren thought of that stack of magazines and those few business cards, and the more he thought about it, the more he felt that he should not leave Xiao Cheng alone to face these challenges.

He could not decide how to behave in public, but he could not really throw the entire matter to Xiao Cheng when it came to dealing with both families, could he?

Xiao Cheng's sincerity and trust had been clearly laid out.

He wanted to marry him, to form a family with him, to come out of the closet publicly, and to be with him openly and honestly.

In today's circumstances, an actor with such courage would be hard to find even by combing through the entire entertainment industry.

Having such intentions essentially meant he was already prepared to give up everything he had.

Wei Zhiren touched his conscience, feeling that he had been easily reassured by Xiao Cheng, believing he could leave everything to him, and realizing how foolish he had been.

On what basis could he ask Xiao Cheng to face such pressure alone?

While thinking about this, President Wei pondered how to bring the matter up with his parents.

If it were any other matter, Wei Zhiren would have jumped straight into action without hesitation.

The problem was coming out of the closet…

Wei Zhiren was not worried that his parents would oppose, as he knew they did not mind whether he found a boy or a girl.

What he was more concerned about was whether his parents would adopt an unfriendly attitude out of consideration for his grandparents’ feelings.

Wei Zhiren had grown up being beaten by his grandfather's cane due to his mischievous and lawless personality.

Each time, it was his parents and brother who had to intervene, pulling his grandfather away so he could escape the subsequent beating.

This situation was common in rural areas, where, due to their lack of education, elders often believed in the saying, ”No beating, no success.“

However, Wei Zhiren was spoiled by his brother, and the more he was beaten, the more he would defy the one who beat him, sticking his tongue out at his grandfather behind his brother's back when provoked.

This was likely one of the reasons his grandfather had always treated him unfriendly.

It was also the main reason Wei Zhiren resisted going back to his hometown during the New Year.

After all, his grandfather would lash out with his cane at any provocation, even hitting his father unintentionally, let alone Wei Zhiren, who never obeyed.

Interestingly, Wei Zhiren's father had been able to continue his studies thanks to his grandfather's early morning and late-night work as a laborer in the neighboring town, earning money to support his education. The grandfather's leg problems had also originated from that time.

Wei Zhiren's mother came from a family of highly educated individuals, but one year, a household accident occurred, and friends avoided them due to the severity of the situation. Only the disdained Wei grandfather had taken out all his savings and given it to Wei Zhiren's family to help them through the crisis.

Thus, Wei Zhiren's father and mother naturally felt a sense of gratitude and respect for Wei Zhiren's grandfather.

His grandfather's opinion carried significant weight in their eyes.

Thinking of his grandfather made Wei Zhiren headache.

Places on his body that had not been hit by the cane in years ached faintly.

Mr. President, having grown up, had gradually let go of his resentment towards his grandfather with time, but he still could not bring himself to be close to him.

After all, he could understand that his own days of drifting and living from hand to mouth did not match the Wei family's image, like a rat dropping in a bowl of fresh soup, it was normal that his grandfather did not like him.

But understanding did not mean he wanted to go and seek disapproval.

So, the biggest problem now was that if he came out of the closet, his grandfather might cause quite a stir.

Wei Zhiren was one hundred percent sure his grandfather would come to the company to cause trouble.

Mr. President sighed deeply at this thought.

Half his body was in the ground, yet his temper still burned so fiercely.

Ah, headache.

Wei Zhiren picked up the pen that had rolled to the side due to his clumsiness, hesitated for a while, and decided to seek some external help.

Wei Zhiren: Brother! Dear brother! Big brother! Dear big brother!

Wei Ziming: …

Wei Ziming: Calling me so affectionately, is your company going bankrupt?

Wei Zhiren: Happy New Year, say something nice [Don't think your good looks mean I won't hit you.jpg]

Wei Ziming: Get to the point.

Wei Zhiren hesitated as he typed on the keyboard.

Wei Zhiren: It's just… how is Grandpa been lately?

Wei Ziming glanced at his grandfather, who was watching the financial news with his father, and sighed lightly.

Wei Ziming: He's fine.

Wei Zhiren looked at the reply, unsure whether he felt more relieved or more worried.

He fidgeted with the mouse wheel, pursing his lips.

Wei Zhiren: So, will they not care if I come out of the closet?

Wei Ziming: You're ready to come clean? Parents won't oppose.

Wei Zhiren: I know Dad and Mom won't oppose this, I just… worry about Grandpa's side.

Wei Ziming raised an eyelid, looking at his grandmother, who was shelling peanuts with his mother.

Wei Ziming: …Also.

Wei Zhiren: Ah, annoying, why don't you just say I'm dead.

Wei Ziming: …Happy New Year, say something nice.

Wei Zhiren did not respond, staring at the computer screen with obvious frustration on his face.

Wei Ziming knew his brother's difficulties, but this matter was unsolvable within the Wei family.

Wei Ziming was silent for a while, glancing at his grandfather watching TV.

Wei Ziming: Wait.

After sending this message, Wei Ziming put his phone back in his pocket, reached for a handful of peanuts, and helped shell them.

Grandmother Wei looked at her grandson and praised him with a smile, ”Xiaoming is so sensible.“

Wei Ziming, hearing this, looked at his grandmother as he peeled peanuts, ”Xiaozhen is also sensible, opening his own company and developing quite well.“

These words caused the entire hall to fall silent abruptly.



Father and Mother Wei looked at each other, laughed awkwardly, and continued their conversation about the topic that had been interrupted.

Mother Wei glanced at Wei Ziming, seeing her eldest son's natural expression, she seemed to believe he had just casually mentioned it, and then turned away.

In the entire family, the one who loved Wei Zhiren the most was undoubtedly Wei Ziming.

Perhaps because when Wei Zhiren was about to be born, Father and Mother Wei had repeatedly told him to take good care of his brother and sister, gradually making this care a duty in Wei Ziming's mind.

The feedback Wei Ziming received was his brother's unconditional trust.

Whenever Wei Zhiren had something, the first to know was not his parents, but Wei Ziming.

It had always been thus.

When Mother Wei put aside all her business and returned to family life, she found she could no longer intrude into the relationship between the brothers— even when Wei Zhiren was only two or three years old.

After Wei Ziming finished peeling a dish of peanuts and put them down, his grandmother pulled him away from the living room into the inner room.

Grandmother Wei's hair was white, but she still had a rosy complexion, looking very energetic and in good health.

She pulled her grandson to the door, looked around to make sure no one else from the living room was following, and then turned to Wei Ziming.

She looked at her grandson's slightly puzzled expression, paused for a moment, ”Xiaoming, why did you suddenly mention Xiaozhen?“

Hearing this, Wei Ziming felt something was off.


Chapter 64:
”You speak as though you cannot mention Xiao Zhen; is he not your grandson?“

When Wei Ziming initially did not want to return home to spend the New Year, he still often spoke of his younger brother, hoping to alleviate the tension between the two sides. However, since the old man was firm in his stance, Wei Ziming gradually gave up on the idea.

If not for the fact that his absence would exacerbate the conflict between the two sides, Wei Ziming was not particularly eager to return himself.

”How can Xiao Zhen not be mentioned here? It has been so many years, and you have been ignoring him as if he does not exist?“

Wei Ziming was starting to lose his temper as he spoke.

He had always been concerned about his precious younger brother, so why could he not even be mentioned here?

Grandmother Wei also sensed the anger in her grandson's words and sighed, ”You know your grandfather's temper…“

She did not continue but instead asked, ”How has Xiao Zhen been lately?“

Wei Ziming looked at his grandmother and sized her up for a while, puzzled by the tone that did not seem to be directed at Wei Zhen.

”He is doing well,“ Wei Ziming said.

Grandmother Wei asked again, ”Why hasn't he come to visit for so many years?“

”He fears that Grandfather will beat him. After all, he is grown up and would not do anything to defy the old man,“ Wei Ziming spoke calmly, though his face bore an angry expression. ”Anyway, Grandfather always has a bad face when he sees him, so it is better to avoid it and make both sides happy.“

Grandmother Wei sighed several times and held her grandson's hand, ”Your grandfather went too far back then.“

Wei Ziming thought to himself that she was also scowling back then, but he kept it to himself and said, ”Grandfather still speaks of Xiao Zhen the same way, even after so many years.“

Grandmother Wei sighed again, ”What can be done? He just cannot bring himself to admit it.“

”Your grandfather is stubborn. Once he sets his mind on something, it is like trying to turn a rock with eight oxen. Over the years, he has convinced himself that he was right, and the villagers always flatter him, so he cannot bring himself to admit it.“

Grandmother Wei patted her grandson's hand, ”After all, he is family. Let Xiao Zhen visit more often, or at least give him a call.“

Wei Ziming's face showed a hint of a smile, but there was no real joy. ”Grandmother, I cannot decide this. Grandfather will not admit it, and Xiao Zhen will not either. Young people are shy.“

After a pause, he added, ”Moreover, if I convince Xiao Zhen to come back and Grandfather gets angry and beats him up, that will make enemies, and there will be no chance to reconcile.“

”Why don't you talk to Grandfather about this?“

Everyone in the Wei family doted on their wife, including the stubborn Grandfather Wei, who was always gentle with his wife.

Convincing Grandmother Wei was almost half the battle.

The rest depended on how firm Grandmother Wei was with Grandfather—usually, it would work.

Having received Grandmother Wei's positive response, Wei Ziming returned to the living room, sitting quietly while his parents and Grandfather chatted, also passing on a message to his younger brother.

Wei Ziming: It's basically settled.

Wei Ziming: [Feels the red scarf on my chest is even brighter now.jpg]

Wei Zhen: …? What?

Wei Ziming: Grandmother looks like she has already regretted it and is ready to talk to Grandfather. She will probably use her emotions to persuade him.

Wei Zhen felt deeply wronged as he read his brother's message.

Wei Zhen: Oh, she has already regretted it. Why didn't she mention me before to make me come home for the New Year?

Wei Zhen: Are you trying to coax me? Hmph, I don't believe them!

Wei Ziming: [Try that again and see what happens.jpg]

Wei Ziming: Do you want to come out of the closet and be laughed at, losing your face?

Mr. President imagined the scene.

Wei Zhen: That would only prove I am not their biological child.

Wei Zhen: [Empress Hua's cold laugh.jpg]

Wei Ziming: Don't think about it.

Wei Ziming: If you are going to come out of the closet here, choose a good time, or you might end up in a difficult situation.

Wei Zhen: [Rolling eyes][Rolling eyes][Rolling eyes] Oh.

Wei Ziming looked at the string of rolling eyes from his brother and thought for a moment.

Wei Ziming: How about you come back for the Lantern Festival? I will be with you.

Wei Zhen: …

Wei Zhen: We'll see, who knows if I will get beaten again.

Wei Zhen: If Mr. Wei comes to work with a black eye, it will be a big news story!

Despite his words, on the fifteenth day of the first month, the Lantern Festival, Wei Zhen brought gifts and returned home with his brother Xiaoming.

Father Wei was grateful and, after stabilizing his business, helped the village build roads and houses. Now, life in the village was more comfortable than in the city, with convenient transportation.

Wei Zhen peered out the window and almost could not recognize his hometown.

He turned to his brother, who was driving, ”I suspect Xiaoming wants to sell me!“

Wei Ziming looked puzzled.

”This is not my hometown at all!“

Wei Zhen's memory of Grandfather's house was of uneven, muddy roads and a mountain village where he could go anywhere he pleased.

Wei Ziming did not bother with his brother's irrational fears and focused on driving.

Wei Zhen did not actually want his brother to be so dramatic.

However, after being away for so long, the changes and the impending challenges made him feel anxious.

Grandfather Wei was a dark figure in Wei Zhen's mind.

To be honest, if it were not for the fear that coming out of the closet would be exposed to Grandfather Wei, leading to consequences he did not want, he would not have wanted to see this unreasonable senior again.

Disobeying meant a beating with a thick wooden cane.

The pain from when he was younger was etched in his memory.

The car stopped in front of a standalone building.

Wei Zhen looked around in the car, seeing no trace of the rough house he remembered.

Wei Ziming unbuckled his seatbelt and also helped his bewildered brother.

”Get out, what are you staring at?“ Brother Xiaoming tousled his brother's short, soft hair. ”Don't be afraid. If Grandfather wants to hit you, just hide behind me and ’whisper‘ again.“

Wei Zhen: …

That was a long-forgotten black history.

Brother Xiaoming, you have a good memory.

Wei Zhen took a deep breath, opened the car door, took the gifts from the back seat, and followed his brother into the house.

Grandmother Wei came to greet them.

”Xiao Zhen is back!“ Grandmother Wei wore a red dress, looking joyous. ”You brought gifts? You are a good boy.“

Wei Zhen looked at the old lady for a while, awkwardly chuckling before bringing the gifts inside and softly calling out, ”Grandmother.“

The old lady's smile grew wider as she happily invited, ”Do you want something to drink?“

Wei Zhen: …

He sat on the sofa, moving closer to his brother, feeling uncomfortable, ”Just water.“

Grandmother Wei's smile did not change.


Chapter 65:
Wei Ziming felt that Wei Zhen must have endured a great deal of suffering during this meal, but not arguing was already a significant improvement.

Brother Xiaoming served Brother Xiaozhen two large chicken legs as a reward.

After the meal, Wei Zhen crawled into the kitchen to help his mother wash the dishes, evading his grandfather's gaze.

”Still so afraid of your grandfather?“ Wei Mother smiled at her youngest son.

Wei Zhen was straightforward with his mother: ”Psychological trauma.“

Wei Mother lowered her eyes and continued washing the dishes, ”Your grandfather is getting old; it's better to accommodate him a bit.“

Wei Zhen remained silent for a while, ”Accommodating isn't impossible, but it depends on the matter.“

”What?“ Wei Mother gently poked her son, ”Do you have some earth-shattering secret?“

”Our sky may not flip, but the sky over Grandfather's side definitely will,“ Wei Zhen placed the clean plates to the side.

Wei Mother was quite curious upon hearing this: ”What is it? Tell me.“

”Put down the plates in your hand first.“

Wei Zhen watched his mother obediently put down the plates before speaking.

”Mom, I'm with Xiao Cheng.“

The author has something to say: Wei Mother: I might have given birth to a fake son.



Wei Zhen waved his hand in front of her face, ”What's wrong, Mom? So shocking?“

A son coming out as gay without any precautions was indeed quite shocking.

Wei Mother regained her composure, took a deep breath, and her mind buzzed.

”If your brother told you his partner was a man, you would find it shocking too.“

Wei Zhen thought about it.

…That was indeed shocking.

”But I think you should have been prepared for this,“ Wei Zhen said, taking the plates and chopsticks from Wei Mother to help wash them, ”Xiaoming even guaranteed that you wouldn't mind.“

”Yes,“ Wei Mother calmed down, ”Actually, I've had psychological preparation with your father for a long time.“

Wei Zhen was stunned.

Wei Mother began to count off on her fingers, ”After all, among your peers, you're the only one with genuine feelings for a celebrity, and he's a male celebrity.“

This was true; in Wei Zhen's circle, if someone liked a celebrity, their first instinct was always to find a way to sleep with them, not to be a fan like Wei Zhen.

”Your room full of posters and merchandise also worried me about your orientation when you replaced the NBA stars’ posters with Xiao Cheng's.“

”Later, when you and your brother planned to ’dig‘ Xiao Cheng, I also met him, and he's a pretty decent guy.“

”Besides…“ Wei Mother wanted to mention that Wei Zhen hugged Xiao Cheng's pillow to sleep every day and occasionally did things that hinted at more than just sleeping.

However, to preserve her youngest son's youthful heart, she swallowed the words.

”In short, this matter won't cause a stir in our home.“

Wei Mother put Wei Zhen's clean plates away in the cabinet, ”Your mother and father believe that children have their own happiness, and we have no special expectations. You and Xiao Cheng should promote each other and be happy in the future.“

Wei Mother looked at her youngest son wiping the kitchen counter and sighed softly.

Actually, Wei Mother felt a lot of guilt towards her youngest son. After giving birth to Wei Zhen, she was determined to return to the family and live with her child, growing up together.

However, by the time she finished everything and could let go, she could no longer hold the first position in her youngest son's heart.

Fortunately, Wei Ziming was a good brother, so Wei Mother could only do her best to be good to Wei Zhen.

For example, whenever Wei Zhen needed pocket money or wanted to buy something, Wei Mother was always generous and often proactively asked if he needed money to solve any problems.

This was why Wei Zhen always felt that his mother believed that money could solve everything.

”Did you come this time to tell Grandfather and Grandma about this?“ Wei Mother asked.

”…“ Wei Zhen was silent for a moment, ”It depends. Honestly, I feel that no matter when we say this, it will end up in chaos.“

Correcting the elderly's stubborn thoughts was no less difficult than reversing the Earth.

”I feel the same,“ Wei Mother dried her hands and patted her son's shoulder, ”But don't worry, your parents and brother are all on your side.“

Wei Zhen was stunned, ”…Huh?“

”What huh? Your grandfather didn't bother with you when you were young, and now that you're grown up, he has no right to interfere. We'll advise you to be considerate with your grandfather on other matters, but this is your personal freedom, and we understand.“

Wei Zhen hugged his mother tightly, ”Mom, you're really my mom!“

Wei Mother pushed away her son who wanted to cry, ”Get off!“

Wei Zhen didn't move, shamelessly蹭 next to his mother, ”Hug me.“

Wei Mother was disgusted, ”How old are you? Don't be ashamed.“

”You said I'm always your baby,“ Wei Zhen was shameless.

Wei Mother was slightly shocked by her youngest son's audacity.

Then she turned and quickly left the kitchen.

The atmosphere in the living room was somewhat tense.

Wei Zhen, however, was completely unaffected. He happily came out of the kitchen and grinned at his brother.

Wei Ziming glanced at him, grabbed a handful of peanuts for his brother, ”Told?“

”Yes,“ Wei Zhen nodded, feeling that he could start square dancing to the most dazzling ethnic wind at this moment.

Seeing his brother's happiness, Wei Ziming couldn't help but laugh as well.

”See, I told you,“ Wei Ziming picked a large white rabbit candy, peeled it himself, and put it in his brother's mouth.

”Yes, yes, Xiaoming, you're the best,“ Wei Zhen chewed the candy, feeling the sweet taste spreading from his mouth to his heart.

Wei Ziming waited for his brother to finish, peeled another piece, and waved it in front of him, ”Call me brother.“

Mr. President was particularly obedient: ”Brother!“

Xiaoming Brother smiled satisfactorily, then ate the candy.

Wei Zhen: ”…“

?

?!

Why are you like this, Xiaoming!?

Mr. President stared at his brother in disbelief.

The elders of the Wei family sitting to the side couldn't help but laugh at the brothers’ interaction—except for Wei Grandfather who maintained a stern face.

Wei Zhen had never called him since he arrived.

He hadn't called Wei Zhen either.

The two acted as if the other didn't exist, going about their own business.

Wei Grandmother looked at her husband and decided not to bother him.

She turned and softened her expression, chatting with Wei Zhen, ”Zhen, Xiaoming already has a partner, when are you planning to find yours?“

Her tone was extremely gentle, showing that she wanted to repair the relationship between grandparent and grandchild.

Wei Zhen paused upon hearing this, looked at his brother, then at his mother.

Both made a ”whatever“ gesture.

Wei Zhen thought it was a no-win situation, so he decided to be straightforward and say it early to avoid unnecessary complications.

Mr. President put down his teacup, ”Yes, I came here to talk about something with you two.“

Grandmother was stunned, looking at her grandson's serious expression, she nodded lightly, ”Say.“

”I have a partner,“ Wei Zhen said.

Grandmother's face lit up with joy, ”Great news!“

”I'm not done yet, Grandma,“ Wei Zhen moved closer to his brother, ”My partner is a man.“

Everyone in the living room, except Wei Mother and Wei Ziming, was stunned into silence.

The first to react was Wei Father. He turned to look at his wife, seeing Wei Mother nod slightly, he changed his posture, ready to prevent Wei Grandfather from attacking.

Wei Grandfather gradually reacted too. His eyes widened, and his face displayed extreme anger.

Although Wei Grandfather was quite old, he still spoke with full strength, his voice almost shaking the roof, ”What did you say!?“

Wei Zhen remained calm and repeated, ”I said, I have a partner, and he's a man. I'm gay.“


Chapter 66:
Grandpa Wei was instantly enraged, his face turning beet red as he picked up the cane beside the sofa. The muscles on his face tensed, and the corners of his mouth twitched uncontrollably.

His cane slammed heavily on the table, thudding loudly and even causing the fruit platter and the dish of peanuts to topple over. ”Brat, you say that again!“

Who was he calling a brat!

Wei Zhiren's anger flared up instantly!

”Spit! Old brute! It doesn't matter how many times I say it, I am gay, and my partner is a man! Did you hear me?!“

Grandpa Wei stood up, ready to swing his cane, but was firmly held back by Father Wei. Unable to contain his rage, he roared, ”Since childhood, you lacked discipline. Look at you now! You're a pervert!“

Wei Zhiren was incensed. He shook off his brother's hand that was trying to pull him back, pointed at Grandpa Wei's nose, and spoke louder than him!

”You're lying! My parents raised me! My brother disciplined me! I have nothing to do with you! I didn't even take your New Year's money. Who are you to say I lack discipline, that I'm a pervert? What do you care about me? Just hitting me, huh?“

Grandpa Wei's face distorted with anger, but everyone was holding him back, and his cane swung wildly without landing a blow. ”Listen to me! Does this sound like human speech? Why are you stopping me? Just kill this brat, to save the face of my Wei family!“

”Oh, how glorious my Wei family's lineage is, I'm so scared!“

Wei Zhiren was about to explode with anger. He had been navigating the entertainment industry and B City's decadent circles for so many years. While he hadn't mastered much, he was undoubtedly an expert in arguments.

”Keep yelling! Yell until everyone knows! Let the whole world know that the old Wei family has a gay member, disgracing our ancestors!“

After saying that, Wei Zhiren felt a sense of relief wash over him.

Yes!

What was he afraid of?

Shouldn't he be more concerned about Grandpa Wei, who was so eager to honor the family lineage?

Realizing this, Wei Zhiren suddenly felt a mysterious composure.

”Go ahead and yell, my company's door is just there. Yell until I go bankrupt, until the company collapses. I have my brother and my partner to take care of me, you don't have any ancestors to glorify.“

Wei Zhiren acted as if he was a pig that didn't care about boiling water, putting on a face of a rogue, crossing his arms, and smiling at Grandpa Wei.

”I'm here to tell you guys today. Whether you can accept it is none of my business.“

Wei Zhiren looked at Grandpa Wei, who could only stare at him in disbelief.

”It's my right to choose my partner, and it's my right to live my life as I please. How you treated me in the past, don't expect me to be obedient to you now. You're halfway to the grave; stay in the countryside and enjoy your life in peace. Don't interfere with my life.“

”I'll stop here. If you want to yell, I'll support you with all my hands and feet. But you can't kill me, and you'll be the one disgracing the old Wei family.“

After saying that, Wei Zhiren bent down to pick up the car keys on the table, walked out of the house proudly like a peacock, and drove away.

The author had something to say: Wei Ziming: You drove off my car, what should I do…?

Wei Zhiren: …I believe in Brother Ming's long legs!



He felt refreshed, as if all the pent-up anger within him had been released in that burst.

There was a sense of liberation, as if he had severed all the entangled ropes and threads at one go.

Thinking about the loneliness and sadness he felt when he was alone at home, he now felt a great relief.

Breaking ties was actually much more comforting than lingering doubt.

Fully breaking ties meant he could completely put these people and this matter aside, no longer feeling the pain of exclusion.

Wei Zhiren was in a good mood and even hummed a tune.

The boss with a bad voice was having fun in the car by himself—no one would criticize him for singing when he was alone.

Oh, wait.

There was someone who wouldn't criticize his bad voice.

Wei Zhiren thought of his partner and wanted to call him, but immediately realized that Xiao Cheng was shooting a movie in the countryside.

Ah…

The boss sighed lightly.

He hadn't finished his sigh when his phone rang.

Wei Zhiren glanced at it; the caller was Doctor Monkey.

Wei Zhiren was slightly stunned but still connected the call through the car's Bluetooth.

”Doctor Monkey, aren't you shooting a movie in the countryside?“ the boss casually asked.

It was quiet in the car, and the Bluetooth audio was clear. Wei Zhiren focused on the road illuminated by the car lights, hearing the distant barking of dogs and chirping of insects from Xiao Cheng's side.

Before Xiao Cheng could answer, Wei Zhiren smiled and said, ”You can still hear the insects on this weather, Doctor Monkey. You must be in a very natural place.“

Xiao Cheng emitted a sound that sounded like laughter, ”Today is the Lantern Festival. I was afraid you'd be lonely alone, so I rushed to a town outside the mountains with signal after finishing shooting.“

Drama Emperor Wei thought that at this time, Wei Zhiren must be alone.

Maybe even working overtime at the company.

Thinking of this, Xiao Cheng paused, noticing the quiet on Wei Zhiren's end, and asked, ”At the company?“

”No, on my way home,“ Wei Zhiren pursed his lips, ”I'm not lonely at all today. I just came out from the countryside.“

Xiao Cheng was stunned, ”Going home?“

He remembered what Wei Zhiren told him about his grandparents during the New Year, slightly frowned, and reflexively took out the chewing gum from his pocket to eat two pieces.

”What happened?“ he asked.

Wei Zhiren didn't notice Xiao Cheng's tone of worry, his voice slightly distorted by the electronic conversion.

But Wei Zhiren's ease and joy were unmistakable.

”I just defeated the big boss and announced our relationship!“

The boss said so.

Xiao Cheng was stunned for a moment, taking a long time to realize what Wei Zhiren meant.

He took a deep breath, ”You came out to your family… and to your grandparents?“

The boss proudly said, ”Mm-hm.“

Drama Emperor Xiao was silent for a while, then bit the chewing gum loudly and asked, ”Why didn't you wait for me?“

Wei Zhiren was taken aback, ”I can't just leave you to face it alone, are you stupid?“

Drama Emperor Xiao was a bit unhappy, ”But you went alone…“

The boss snorted, interrupting Xiao Cheng, ”Ah, you don't know how hard it is for the old man to talk, it's basically impossible for him to accept us. I don't want you to get scolded!“

After that, Wei Zhiren thought for a moment and added, ”Oh, he might even beat you up.“

Xiao Cheng sighed lightly, ”I think your grandpa and my grandpa must have a lot in common.“

Wei Zhiren was surprised, ”Your grandpa likes to beat you up too?“

Then he realized Xiao Cheng's family background, understanding that such a family environment would naturally use a tough approach rather than a gentle one.

”Yes,“ Xiao Cheng sighed lightly, ”A single disagreement and he'd whip me, leaving a bloody mark.“

Wei Zhiren gasped, ”Then I definitely won't go see your grandpa.“

Just thinking about it was terrifying.

”I think if we meet our grandpas, they'll fight first,“ Wei Zhiren felt a connection.

The boss felt that if he and Xiao Cheng were really to run into Xiao Cheng's father without precautions, his anger would likely cause him to press both of them to the ground and whip them.

”I won't bring you to meet my father either.“

Xiao Cheng was unwilling to let Wei Zhiren face his stubborn father, just as Wei Zhiren was unwilling to let Xiao Cheng face his father.

”However, you came out faster than me,“ Drama Emperor Xiao was biting the chewing gum loudly.

He hadn't told his family about this yet.

”I was asked, so I just said it. Anyway, I don't care if my grandpa blesses me or not,“ Wei Zhiren was very open-minded.

Just as Mother Wei said, life had to be lived by oneself. He just wanted to be happy and content, why sacrifice his happiness for others?

”I won't care about my father's side, as for my parents…“ Wei Zhiren paused, then corrected himself, ”Our parents have always been prepared for this. Mom even said you're a good boy.“


Chapter 67:
Xiao Cheng listened to Wei Zhiren change his words to call their parents, feeling as if a warm current enveloped his heart, and an involuntary deep smile graced his face.

Wei Zhiren, on the other end of the phone, spoke in a tone reminiscent of a Google Nanny, saying, ”Good boy, Doctor Monkey, when are you planning to come home for a meal to meet our parents?“

Xiao Yingdi burst out laughing immediately.

He cleared his throat and mimicked Wei Zhiren's tone, replying, ”I'll go right after I finish shooting, okay?“

Wei Zhiren held the steering wheel, his brows crinkling in a smile, ”Alright, alright. If you don't come, I'll divorce you.“

Xiao Yingdi's voice was as gentle as sweet milk mixed with honey, ”To be frank, you won't have that chance.“

Wei Zhiren was about to continue bantering with Xiao Yingdi when his phone buzzed, indicating another incoming call.

”Doctor Monkey, Brother Xiaoming is calling!“

Xiao Yingdi responded lightly, ”Then I'll hang up first. Happy Lantern Festival.“

”Happy Lantern Festival!“ Mr. President gave a fierce kiss, ”Hurry back, I miss you.“

Xiao Cheng's laughter, deep and melodious, echoed in the quiet car, making Mr. President feel slightly embarrassed.

He hung up the call directly, took a deep breath, and switched to Wei Ziming's call.

Neither of the brothers spoke after the call was connected.

Wei Zhiren was still lost in his conversation with Xiao Cheng, driving attentively without regaining his composure.

Wei Ziming, on the other hand, was wondering who had been talking to his brother for so long.

Without a doubt, it was Xiao Cheng, the one who had hooked his brother.

Wei Ziming snorted.

Wei Zhiren was momentarily stunned, ”Ah, what happened to my Xiaoming? Did Grandpa beat him up?“

”Do you really think I was beaten up?“ Wei Ziming's voice rose slightly.

Wei Zhiren hastily denied, ”Of course not, would I be like that?“

Wei Ziming knew his brother's sneaky thoughts too well and wasn't in the mood to argue.

He simply asked, ”You took the car away, how will I get back?“

”Right.“ Wei Zhiren rubbed his nose, starting to adjust the GPS, ”Then walk out of the village to the main road, I'll come back to pick you up.“

The first thing Wei Ziming did when he got in the car was not to question Wei Zhiren for directly confronting the elders but to ask who he had just been talking to.

Wei Zhiren answered honestly, ”Talking to Xiao Cheng.“

Wei Ziming wasn't surprised at all.

Mr. President handed the driver's seat to his brother, reclining comfortably in his seat, ”Xiao Cheng said the movie is finished, he'll come over to our place for a formal meeting and dinner.“

Wei Ziming started the car, frustrated, ”You're in such a hurry to get married?“

After listening, Wei Zhiren rolled over to face his brother, puzzled, ”Why can't it be me who marries Xiao Cheng?“

Wei Ziming snorted in disbelief, clearly disdainful of the suggestion.

Wei Zhiren: ”…“

What are you snorting at?

You don't support your adorable little brother!

I doubt you even think about this brother.

Mr. President was displeased.

He looked at his brother, who was driving seriously, and argued, ”Xiaoming, I've never won against you, this time I found an object faster than you, admit it!“

Wei Ziming: ”…“

Brother Xiaoming suspected his brother might have water in his head.

Everything had to be compared.

Wei Zhiren persisted, ”Admit it!“

Brother Xiaoming couldn't take it anymore, ”In finding a boyfriend, I admit.“

The day after Wei Ziming and Wei Zhiren returned home, their father and mother also came back, not mentioning Wei Grandpa at all, but asking Wei Zhiren when he would invite Xiao Cheng over for a meal to get to know him—and his family.

Wei Zhiren answered truthfully and added that the two families needed more time to meet.

The main reason was that Wei Zhiren had come out of the closet unexpectedly, catching Xiao Yingdi off guard, who had been planning to gradually introduce him to the family.

But it didn't matter.

Mr. President had an unfounded trust in Xiao Yingdi.

He believed that if Xiao Cheng said he could handle it with his family, it would definitely be fine.

And Xiao Cheng kept his promise. After shooting for more than two months in a remote area, he rushed back to the Wei residence.

Wei Zhiren was slightly bewildered when he opened the door.

Looking at the obvious fatigue and weariness on the man's face, he felt deeply moved.

He pulled him inside, taking the gift baskets from Xiao Cheng's hands, ”Why didn't you rest for the night?“

Xiao Yingdi was changing his shoes when he heard this and displayed an extremely beautiful smile.

”Because I was afraid you'd divorce me,“ he said softly.

Author's note: Wei Ziming: I feel my status is being threatened.
Xiao Cheng: Hello, big brother. :)



Wei Zhiren glanced at his brother, frowned, and carried the gifts into the living room.

Xiao Cheng had already informed Wei Zhiren that he was returning today.

So the entire Wei family postponed their work and made time to return home in the afternoon.

Also, due to the special circumstances, they gave the housekeeper a day off.

So when Xiao Cheng followed Wei Zhiren into the living room, the family of four, excluding Wei Zhiren, sat on the sofa looking at him in surprise.

—They hadn't expected Xiao Cheng to come so early.

They hadn't even had time to prepare dinner.

Feeling Xiao Cheng's gaze, he felt a layer of sweat on his back.

But as the Emperor of Actors, Xiao Yingdi remained composed and calm, even adjusting his posture and angle to make a good impression on Wei Zhiren's family.

Xiao Cheng greeted first, ”Uncle and Aunt, good afternoon.“

Mother Wei had seen Xiao Cheng before and still had a smile on her face.

”Xiao Cheng, nice to see you again,“ she said, standing up and heading to the kitchen, ”Sit for a while, I'll prepare dinner.“

Xiao Cheng stopped, ”If it's not inconvenient, I'll cook today.“

”Ai?“ Mother Wei was stunned, not expecting Xiao Cheng to do this.

Although Wei Zhiren felt bad for Xiao Cheng's tired appearance, he didn't stop him at this moment—after all, Xiao Cheng was trying his best to make a good impression on his parents.

Mr. President glanced at his mother, put down the fruits and gifts, and walked forward to push her back onto the sofa.

”Mom, let Xiao Cheng cook, you rest.“

He then pulled Xiao Cheng into the kitchen without waiting for his mother to react.

Mother Wei, who had been cooking outside, was surprised, ”Xiao Cheng can actually cook, isn't he a big star?“

Wei Ziming put down the newspaper and looked back at the two figures in the kitchen.

He nodded lightly, ”What's wrong with a big star? Xiao Cheng not only can cook, the flavor is quite good.“

Hearing this, Father and Mother Wei turned to look at their eldest son.

Father Wei, who had been sitting upright as a backdrop, finally couldn't hold it in, ”What did you say…“

”Little Zhen didn't tell you?“ Wei Ziming looked at his parents, ”Don't look at me, when you weren't home, Xiao Cheng had already come once.“

Father and Mother Wei: ”…“

Wei Ziming looked at his parents, who didn't know what to say, and decided to give Xiao Cheng a good impression first.

”Who could have found you all over the world?“ Wei Ziming pointed at the two figures in the kitchen, ”Xiao Cheng has already talked to me once.“

Mother Wei felt a bit bitter hearing this.

She looked at her eldest son and snorted, ”Xiaoming, you'll definitely be a good father one day.“

Wei Ziming: ”…“

It's not my fault.

Who could have found you during your honeymoon?

Brother Xiaoming was used to Mother Wei's unreasonable behavior and even seemed to enjoy it.

”Xiao Cheng said he would come out of the closet to his family and publicly announce his feelings for Little Zhen. You can rest assured, he never planned to hide it from the beginning.“


Chapter 68:
Wei Ziming still wanted to talk about Wei Zhen's long-ago connection with Xiao Cheng, but in the end, he did not.

One must leave something for Xiao Cheng to say.

In the end, he could only conclude with one sentence: ”He is truly sincere with Xiao Zhen.“

Wei Zhen and Xiao Cheng had no idea that Wei Ziming had orchestrated a large group of people to their advantage outside.

Wei Zhen was assisting Xiao Cheng, watching the latter's composed and calm demeanor, and feeling even more anxious than him.

”You don't look nervous at all,“ Wei Zhen leaned over to Xiao Cheng.

”Who said I'm not nervous? My palms are sweating.“ Xiao Cheng raised his eyelids, his hand on the bowl gripping Wei Zhen's. ”Feel it.“

The warm and damp hand enveloped his, Wei Zhen glanced at the kitchen door, seeing Wei Mother looking in their direction, he instantly pulled his hand back.

”Hurry up and cook, finish eating and rest. You look like you're about to faint.“

Xiao Cheng laughed and retracted his hand, slicing several slices of ginger into the soup pot, and clarified offhandedly, ”My physique is very strong, I won't faint.“

Wei Zhen washed vegetables silently on the side.

Xiao Cheng's cooking was not extravagant, all home-style dishes, and the flavors were all slightly sweet, clearly made to cater to the tastes of the Wei family.

The dining table was not particularly lively. Wei Father did not like bringing the habit of drinking at work banquets into his own home, so without alcohol, the atmosphere was much more subdued.

Xiao Cheng ate his meal quietly, particularly composed and calm. Wei Father and Wei Mother occasionally asked him questions, and he answered them smoothly, without adding anything else.

Wei Zhen looked at the pieces of pork rib Xiao Cheng had placed in his bowl, then glanced at his parents who were eyeing him and Xiao Cheng with intent, he shrank his neck and snuggled closer to Xiao Cheng.

”Mom and Dad, I'm going to marry Xiao Cheng.“

Wei Father and Wei Mother, who had been planning to bring up this topic gradually, were at a loss: ”… “

Little Ming could not hold it in, turning his head to avoid the gaze of the people at the table and laughed silently.

”Little Ming, what are you laughing at!“ Wei Zhen bit into a piece of pork rib fiercely.

Wei Ziming waved his hand, his expression instantly turning serious and solemn, denying, ”I'm not laughing.“

Wei Father was furious at being forced to elbow Xiao Cheng's youngest son in favor of him.

He glared at Wei Zhen, then turned to Xiao Cheng, ”What are your plans for the future?“

”… I didn't expect Xiao Zhen to be so quick to tell you all, so my family still doesn't know, but I will handle it as soon as possible.“

Xiao Yǐngdìng was very honest, ”I have another movie about to start shooting, announcing it at this stage would affect box office, so I need to wait a while before making it public, I'm very sorry.“

The people at the table had all been in the business world, naturally understanding the impact of actors coming out publicly and did not mind this point.

Wei Father's question was quite practical, ”The impact of coming out publicly on an actor is devastating, what will you do after you stop being an actor?“

Xiao Cheng shook his head, ”I have been investing all along, losing my identity as an actor won't affect my career.“

Wei Father smiled, satisfied with the answer, and only said, ”Be good to Xiao Zhen.“

The meal ended in mutual satisfaction, the atmosphere between Xiao Cheng and the Wei family was much better than when he first arrived.

After the meal, Wei Zhen followed Xiao Cheng, who voluntarily offered to wash the dishes, into the kitchen.

Xiao Cheng glanced around the kitchen, turning on the water and asked, ”I wanted to ask last time, why doesn't your house have a dishwasher?“

Xiao Cheng's house did have one, but since he was always eating alone, he just washed it himself.

”Because Mom is particularly stubborn, believing that family members taking turns washing dishes can deepen the sense of belonging and intimacy in the family.“

Wei Zhen sometimes did not understand his mother's way of thinking.

Xiao Cheng glanced at the living room upon hearing this, smiled, and said nothing.

Wei Zhen followed Xiao Cheng's heels like a little tail.

Xiao Cheng did not mind him getting in the way and let him follow wherever he went.

Xiao Yǐngdìng glanced at his little tail, ”Are you happy?“

”I'm of course happy,“ Wei Zhen looked at Xiao Cheng and could no longer hold it back, bursting into laughter.

He spread his arms and hugged his idol, rubbing against him fiercely, his hair standing up due to static, ”From now on, Chengcheng is our Chengcheng!“

Xiao Cheng let Wei Zhen hug him from behind and rub against him, his smile equally uncontrollable, ”Yes, yes, yes, becoming your Chengcheng, is there any reward?“

Mr. President coughed lightly, ”Say what reward you want!“

Xiao Cheng thought for a moment, listening to the crisp sound of the bowls and chopsticks clashing in his hand, and said, ”I want my Zhenzhen to sleep with me every night.“

”Granted!“ Mr. President did not hesitate.

Xiao Yǐngdìng saw him agree so readily and immediately demanded more, ”I also want my Zhenzhen to kiss me.“

Wei Zhen tightened his arms around Xiao Cheng, his face flushed, and when he spoke again, his words were stuttering, ”Doctor Monkey, I'm telling you, my parents are still here, don't be a rogue.“

”This is a reasonable request.“ Xiao Yǐngdìng washed his hands and dried them, turning to embrace Mr. President from behind, ”Kiss?“

Wei Zhen's vision went haywire, and he could not help but turn his head to glance at the kitchen door that was not fully closed, taking a deep breath, he turned his head back, reaching out to cup Xiao Cheng's face and kissed those plump red lips eagerly.

After the kiss, he hastily let go of Xiao Cheng's arm, patting it, ”Hurry up and let go, Little Ming might see!“

Xiao Yǐngdìng did not let go.

Not only did he not let go, he hugged him even tighter.

”You still haven't had your reward…“ Mr. President's voice was faint, barely audible.

He felt like he was going to be burned by himself.

Xiao Yǐngdìng did not think, ”I also want premarital sex…“

”You guys… uh.“ Wei Ziming looked at the two people hugging tightly in the kitchen, stood there for a while, looked at the thermos in his hand, then at the water dispenser in the kitchen, finally quietly left, closing the kitchen door silently.

Wei Zhen used his head to repeatedly bump Xiao Cheng's shoulder, extremely angry, ”I told you Little Ming would see!“

Xiao Cheng: ”…“

This was very awkward.

Author's note: Wei Ziming: You guys are quite intense.

Xiao Cheng: … I call you Big Brother, and you repay me like this :)

Wei Zhen: [Unwilling to face.jpg]



Wei Zhen saw him off at the door, standing under a magnolia tree with budding flowers, watching Xiao Yǐngdìng sit in the car.

”You'll have to go to M country to film in a few days, right?“

Xiao Yǐngdìng calculated the time, ”I have a week off, but I still need to get familiar with the script.“

Mr. President lightly kicked the ground with his toes, crushing a petal into an unrecognizable shape, then stammered, ”Then when will you tell your family?“

”I have to ask the PR department how they plan to handle this matter first,“ Xiao Cheng looked at Wei Zhen, who seemed slightly uneasy, ”What, you're worried I'll stand you up?“

”I'm not worried, I just think… better to die early and be reborn,“ Mr. President's unease was not due to fear of Xiao Cheng standing him up, ”Always thinking about this, I tend to zone out during work.“

Xiao Yǐngdìng smiled, ”I'll do it as soon as possible.“

Mr. President nodded, leaning against the car window, leaning forward to kiss Xiao Yǐngdìng, straightening up, he patted the car door, ”The Queen bids you goodnight!“

Xiao Cheng smiled and shook his head, closed the car window, and drove away from Wei Zhen's neighborhood.

…

The publicity department of Weicheng had kept Xiao Cheng's participation in the new movie in a state of half-revelation and half-concealment, dangling a hook but never reeling in the catch.

Not only that, they had also infiltrated fan groups with internet trolls to set the tone, inserting topics openly and secretly to guess what Xiao Cheng's new movie would be, generating a lot of buzz around the topic.


Chapter 69:
The topic was heated among the fans, and it was only natural that it would also be hot in the circle of the detractors.

Over the past period, many onlookers, no matter where they were, could casually watch the intense verbal battles between the supporters of Xiao Cheng and the fierce critics.

For instance, some detractors said that given Xiao Cheng's narrow acting range, even if he did participate in a major film, he would likely only be a minor cameo.

In response, the experienced fans of Xiao Cheng, when engaging in their fiery rhetoric, would escalate the matter, elevating it to a higher level, saying that even if he only had a cameo, it would be progress. Count the number of renowned actors and actresses today; who among them has not done a cameo?

Are actors and actresses not all equal when it comes to acting?

They were almost pointing at the detractors, calling them hypocritical and discriminatory. It was clear that these were the kind of cold-blooded keyboard warriors who would talk extravagantly online but cover their noses and avoid looking at环卫 workers in real life!

Xiao Cheng had very little actual dirt on him; it was rather that many baseless rumors had been spread due to the lack of evidence.

His old employer, Light and Shadow, did not show him much favor, so he could only be extremely cautious to avoid being caught with some fabricated pretext.

Therefore, Xiao Cheng's fans would get angry whenever they saw such unfounded detractors, and whenever they caught one, they would wish to delete the person's Weibo account.

The disputes on various social media platforms were intense, but in reality, they did not affect Xiao Cheng at all.

Emperor of Cinema Xiao Cheng entrusted the packaging of his image and the promotion of his film to the publicity and public relations departments of Weicheng, while he himself traveled light, carrying a lightweight suitcase, and landed at the LA airport in M Country.

Liu Xiaomai seemed very excited—after all, Xiao Cheng's step forward did not only signify another flourishing 



In today's environment, the significance of a Chinese face appearing in an international blockbuster went far beyond the personal achievement of an individual.

Why did Weicheng倾 all its resources to promote Xiao Cheng from the very beginning?

Because once Xiao Cheng took this step, the benefits to Weicheng would be immense.

The new company, Weicheng, would gain the much-needed connections, industry resources, and fresh talent. Many veteran actors, who were still hopeful about the new world, would also view this company with renewed interest.

Liu Xiaomai helped Xiao Cheng get a new phone card in M Country, notified the necessary people of their new numbers, and then saw Xiao Cheng snap a selfie.

Liu Xiaomai: ”… What are you doing?“

Emperor of Cinema Xiao Cheng did not lift his head: ”The fans and detractors are causing a stir; I'm posting a photo to show my strength.“

The agent leaned in to take a look at the photo.

It was a beautiful blue sky, white clouds, and a handsome man, with a small part of an airplane's tail visible behind him, indicating where he was.

Liu Xiaomai thought Xiao Cheng was very cunning.

Posting this photo would surely spark another wave of wild speculation.

Xiao Cheng ignored him and posted a tweet with his head lowered.

The content was simple: a single emoji with no words.

Xiao Cheng: [Smiling Face with Smiling Eyes][Picture]

Jingjing's Favorite Chengcheng: … This smiling emoji makes me feel a chill down my spine orz, is it just a feeling?

Jenny's Cross-Dimensional Love for Chengcheng: At the airport? Or during the day? In a place with a time difference… Oh?

Humph: I suspect Chengcheng is planning something big!

Chengcheng's Little Belly Button: I remember Chengcheng said he has never disappointed us before _(:з」∠)_ Hmm… Eh-heh, suddenly I feel like giving the detractors some candles.

Xiao Cheng casually glanced at the heated discussions below his tweet, silently put away his phone, and hid his achievements and fame.

And Xiao Cheng's fans were indeed correct.

Because Xiao Cheng was not the main protagonist but was still considered part of the main cast, his casting photo was released before the leading actors, making him the first of the main cast members to be revealed in this series of films.

As soon as the list of cast members and Xiao Cheng's casting photo were posted on Twitter, the entire Chinese circle exploded.

It was precisely midnight in China.

It was also the golden time for night owls to browse their phones in bed.

Fans who followed this series of films, upon seeing the tweet, screamed and immediately uploaded the screenshot to Weibo.

Xiao Cheng's girlfriend: Aaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Look what I found! [Twitter Screenshot]

The time difference Chinese party exploded, and Xiao Cheng's fan circle followed suit.

The fans wanted to drum and dance, spreading the word to the world about their idol's achievements. In their excitement, they did not forget to drag the hypocritical detractors out to ridicule them.

Especially that tweet saying Xiao Cheng would only be a cameo role at best, which the fans specially reposted, expressing sincere gratitude.

Such as, ”Thank you, Pooster, for your poisonous milk; you are truly the treasure of my fandom!“

Anyone familiar with the Euro-American film industry knew that series films and TV shows were usually decided on whether to make sequels based on ratings and box office performance.

For example, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, some single-character films were spun off from the success of certain characters’ popularity.

This meant that if this film went well, it would be a huge boost to Xiao Cheng's future!

Before Xiao Cheng's casting photo was released, Weicheng was already overwhelmed.

People in the film industry often had a special sense of smell and channels for certain events. While the outside world was still in the midst of chaos, many insiders already knew Xiao Cheng's role.

Though the competition in this circle was fierce, it was also, in a way, a community of mutual interest.

So the news spread quickly among the upper echelons, and it became increasingly difficult to hide.

This was directly reflected in the sudden surge of resumes and various contacts.

After Xiao Cheng's casting photo was released, the mailroom at Weicheng was piled high with fans’ letters and gifts every day.

Some were addressed to Xiao Cheng himself.

Others expressed gratitude to Xiao Cheng's friend—Weicheng's owner.

The fans were all clear about who the biggest benefactor was in Xiao Cheng's step forward.

Moreover, during his previous visit to Weicheng's new headquarters, Xiao Cheng had constantly praised Weicheng and his friend.

This previously unknown new company, Weicheng, seemed to erupt like a volcano, swiftly gaining numerous resources and opportunities, becoming the talk of the town.

As the company's prospects were looking extremely promising, on the verge of becoming the leading economic and entertainment company in the industry, Assistant Wang's heart was in turmoil.

Because President Wei had casually thrown a huge bomb at him.

Wei Zhiren said, ”Xiao Cheng is preparing to come out and announce his relationship; let the Film Department handle it.“

Assistant Wang: ”…“

Can you guys please not cause trouble?

Unwilling to Face.jpg

”What's wrong?“ Wei Zhiren put down the signed documents and pushed his glasses up.

Assistant Wang was at his wit's end: ”The person he's announcing the relationship with… is you?“

President Wei felt Assistant Wang's question was utterly perplexing, but he still maintained his domineering persona: ”Of course not? We've already met his parents.“

Assistant Wang: ”…“

I want to quit, can I?

Of course, this was just a thought. Assistant Wang would never abandon such a well-paid and promising company.

Anyway, after informing the public relations department about this matter, there would certainly be more than one person wanting to shoot their boss and the cash cow.

As Assistant Wang had expected, the overworked head of the public relations department, upon learning of this matter, reacted by slapping the table: ”Where's my forty-meter-long sword!?“

Watch me chop these petty people to pieces!

Unfortunately, there was no gun to shoot the boss and the cash cow, nor was there a forty-meter-long sword to chop those petty people.

The public relations department could only sigh bitterly as they contacted Xiao Cheng, haggling back and forth, and finally decided to release a relatively smaller bomb to gauge the fans’ reactions.

Thus, after returning from filming in M Country, Emperor of Cinema Xiao Cheng immediately proceeded to the press conference for Director Xu's new film.

A journalist asked Xiao Cheng: ”With such good resources from Weicheng Company, will Teacher Xiao be heading towards Hollywood in the future?“

Originally, Xiao Cheng would not answer questions unrelated to the film.

But when the journalist asked this question, Xiao Cheng suddenly revealed a sweet, happy, and warm smile.


Chapter 70:
”Shall it be deferred?“ Xiao Cheng spoke in a voice soft and tender, yet it still resonated throughout the entire venue via the microphone, ”In the coming time, I wish to settle my personal affairs first.“

The author has something to say:
Wang Tezhuli: [Unwilling to Face.jpg]
Public Relations Department: [Where is my knife?.jpg]



The journalists looked at each other, their eyes wide with surprise.

—Xiao Cheng had joked about such matters too many times in the past, making them somewhat hesitant to believe him.

One of the journalists sitting in the front row put down his pen, ”Isn't this a joke?“

Xiao Yindi smiled, ”Not this time.“

The journalists instantly became agitated.

”Does Mr. Xiao intend to announce his relationship?“

”Who is the other party? Someone within the industry?“

”Does Mr. Xiao's statement mean that he will postpone his work plans to handle his relationship? What personal matters does a relationship require him to settle? Or does he plan to get married?“

Xiao Cheng sat on the stage, watching the crowd below erupt in excitement, paused for a moment, ”I currently have no intention of revealing the identity of my lover; I do not wish him to be harmed by public opinion.“

”He is half a person within the industry; we have plans to get married.“

After these two sentences were spoken, Xiao Cheng once again smiled lightly and said, ”As for future plans, that depends on the wishes and intentions of my lover. If he is not pleased, I might consider transitioning to behind the scenes.“

Xiao Cheng looked serene as he spoke, the tenderness in his eyes almost spilling over.

Anyone with eyes could see the affection Xiao Cheng held for his beloved, abandoning his blossoming career at the drop of a hat was sheer indulgence.

The journalists were dazed by the consecutive bombshells Xiao Cheng had thrown at them, yet they remained incredibly excited.

Questions poured in relentlessly, like a hailstorm of bullets, bombarding Xiao Yindi who sat calmly on the stage.

However, once Xiao Yindi, who was accustomed to throwing out bombs and then fleeing, finished his predetermined statements, he perfectly ignored all related questions. By the time the press conference concluded, he simply stood up and left with Xu Daoshou.

During this period, major portals were frequently dominated by Xiao Cheng.

And today, just like before, Xiao Cheng, having dropped three major bombs, once again topped the headlines of major portals.

[Rational Discussion] The old forum thread erupted, a new thread dedicated to Xiao Cheng's latest relationship event was opened, a rational and slow unpeeling of Xiao Cheng's relationship and the interview results.

End of linked post.

Please note that this thread focuses on rational discussion, no malicious feedback, no boyfriend character assassination, no mudslinging without evidence, identifying and criticizing one by one.

No.2 It was inevitable
Claw, everything I wanted to say is on my mask orz

No.3 = =
My Cheng really starts trouble without a word, Weicheng's official website has still not responded, they are either stunned or already colluding.

But judging from my Cheng's behavior of letting loose over the past few months, it seems more likely to be the former.

Light a candle for Weicheng.

No.6 = =
It feels like ten thousand black hats infiltrated the previous thread, jumping up and down, setting the tone.

…

No.41 = =
From what I can see, Xiao Cheng does not seem to want to reveal the identity of his lover, probably out of concern that his lover will be dissed by both black hats and fans.

Regardless, Xiao Cheng's movies and dramas have accompanied me through high school and college, and he will be thirty in a few months, getting married is quite normal, I support my Cheng.

No.42 = =
There was a saying, wasn't there.

One day you will meet the person you like, and the girlfriend of the person you like.

Squeal.

Sympathetic to girlfriend fans, but hope you can remain calm, Xiao Cheng clearly does not want his lover to be attacked by public opinion.

No.44 = =
After reading the previous post, I feel that Xiao Cheng's character assassination is quite impressive, compared to a certain fresh-faced actor who was dissed madly after announcing his relationship, tsk tsk tsk.

No.45 = =
What kind of monster mixed into the previous post, wasn't the previous person dissed justly? They destroyed their boyfriend's warm character and were caught in compromising photos, yet they don't allow people to bash them?

Moreover, with Xiao Cheng's strength and background, does he need to destroy his character? How many people's jaws would drop if they heard this!

No.46 = =
Holy shit, this thread is so short and we are already starting to fight?

…

No.105 = =
No, are you fighting so fiercely that none of you have thought about what the implications of what we said at the Cheng press conference are?

No.106 = =
Hmm?

Xiao Cheng's meaning is that he will currently suspend most activities and focus solely on his relationship, only following Xu Daoshou for promotion at the moment.

After that, the only thing that can be deduced is the promotion of the movie in M Country.

No.107 = =
No no no, it seems you all haven't noticed him saying that if his lover is unhappy, he will turn to behind the scenes?

That means if his lover is unhappy, Xiao Cheng will not continue acting.

No.108 = =
Think a bit deeper, what I Cheng wants to convey might be: If you diss my lover, you won't see me again.

I remember when I Cheng was interviewed before, he said that his investment business was going quite well, and continuing to act was a way to repay his fans.

So… [Helpless Hands]

No.109 = =
Then I really have to laugh, is this a threat to his fans?
What a big ego.

Threat to his fans?

Frankly speaking, I suspect you are a black hat.

You have already inserted yourself into the diss army, right? If you don't diss Xiao Cheng's lover, will Xiao Cheng be angry?

Your logic is messed up?

No.111 = =
After all this, who is Xiao Cheng's lover?

…

Who is Xiao Cheng's lover?

This question has plagued countless media and fans.

Weicheng's official website and Weibo were flooded with inquiries and curses, and the Weibo of the top domestic paparazzo, who failed to uncover any information, was filled with rows of fans calling him a waste, with the number increasing over time.

On the contrary, the comments under Xiao Cheng's Weibo remained peaceful and lively.

Fans were scared by those who were setting the tone, afraid that Xiao Cheng would truly leave the film industry if he was unhappy.

Over the years, Xiao Cheng had never caused trouble, and each time fans were bullied by black hats, Xiao Cheng would always take immediate action to make the black hats squirm, leading to an especially high loyalty among his fans.

Who would have thought that Xiao Cheng, who had not caused trouble for many years, would create such a huge mess in one go.

But four days passed, Weicheng's official website and public relations department continued to feign ignorance, and there was no new content on Xiao Cheng's Weibo page.

And at this time, what were Xiao Cheng and Wei Zhiren doing?

They were meeting the parents.

Wei Zhiren followed Xiao Cheng to the Xiao family, helplessly holding a bowl piled high with food, buried in it, eating.

Mr. President's mind was blank; no matter what Xiao Cheng's parents asked, he obediently answered, completely different from the domineering and calm character he usually portrayed.

Xiao Cheng watched his parents keep shoveling food onto Wei Zhiren's plate and could not help but stop a chopstick.

”Parents, you have scared him.“

Xiao Cheng's parents were not as cold and hard as Wei Zhiren had imagined; they just seemed a bit aloof and not skilled at expressing themselves.


Chapter 71:
So, he could only keep passing dishes to Wei Zhiren to show his goodwill.

Mr. President turned his head and glanced at Xiao Yingtai by his side, then looked at Xiao Father and Xiao Mother who had sheepishly withdrawn their hands, pursing his lips with a shy smile.

Xiao Mother could not hold back and turned her head to look at her son, ”Xiao Cheng, how did you manage to get such a well-behaved child?“

Xiao Cheng: ”… How can one say it is deceiving.“

Xiao Mother took a bite of green vegetables, ”I think normally, you wouldn't find such a cute child.“

Wei Zhiren: ”…“

Xiao Cheng's mother was praising me as cute and good!

Mr. President felt like he was about to spiral into a spectacular explosion.

Xiao Cheng did not speak, only silently picking out all the chili peppers from the bowl next to Wei Zhiren.

Half of the dishes on the table were sweet, but Xiao Mother was not that meticulous; when passing dishes to Wei Zhiren, she inadvertently picked some spicy ones.

Xiao Mother watched Xiao Cheng's actions and Wei Zhiren's habitual manner, then glanced at her husband by her side and nodded lightly.

Xiao Father and Xiao Mother had already come to terms with it over the years. When their son ran away to pursue a career in the entertainment industry, they were opposed.

Observing with cold eyes as their son stumbled and bumbled for ten years, ultimately creating his own realm, to say they were not proud of Xiao Cheng would be a lie.

Xiao Cheng knew what he was doing, and their overbearing comments only made things awkward.

After dinner, Xiao Cheng and Wei Zhiren put the dishes into the dishwasher.

Wei Zhiren glanced at the living room and leaned close to Xiao Cheng's ear, whispering, ”Are they not liking me?“

Xiao Cheng paused, ”Why do you say that?“

Wei Zhiren pinched her fingers, ”As soon as I see them, my mind goes blank, and I'm not enthusiastic. I can't even think of something nice to say…“

”After this, it will be me you live with, not them.“ Xiao Cheng wiped his hands clean and pinched Wei Zhiren's face, ”You won't be living with your mother-in-law. Don't worry.“

”… H-how can you be my mother-in-law!“ Wei Zhiren tugged on Xiao Cheng's sleeve.

Xiao Cheng, hearing this, compared his height with Wei Zhiren's.

”What can body type tell you!“ Wei Zhiren was indignant.

Xiao Cheng thought for a moment, then lifted his robe, taking Wei Zhiren's hand to feel his eight-pack abs, and then poked Wei Zhiren's soft belly through her clothes.

Wei Zhiren: ”…“

Having abs is impressive!

Do you believe I can leap over and slash you!

The author has something to say: Wei Zhiren: [I leap over and slash you.jpg]

Xiao Cheng: [Secret Skill·Empty-handed Deflection of White Blades.jpg]



Perhaps due to the fact that every time he left the house, he would face a barrage of long guns and short cameras, Mr. President usually stayed at home or at the Weicheng headquarters when there were no activities.

Of course, most people did not know that Mr. President's decision to spend the day at the company or at home depended on Mr. President's work schedule.

When Wei Zhiren did not need to go out all day, we could usually see Xiao Cheng leisurely strolling around the Weicheng headquarters building.

When Wei Zhiren had matters to attend to and needed to leave the office, Mr. President would definitely not be at Weicheng.

However, since Wei Zhiren rarely needed to go out for social engagements, Xiao Cheng still spent a lot of time at Weicheng.

What did he do at Weicheng?

When he was idle at the Weicheng headquarters, he liked to go and give acting and dialogue lessons to the newcomers.

Xiao Cheng was well aware that every move he made was under scrutiny and could not hide in Wei Zhiren's office, cuddling with the dear president. Since he had plenty of free time, he might as well cultivate some goodwill with these new talents at Weicheng and nurture the next generation of money-making trees.

Initially, the Weicheng staff would curiously gather around to watch, but over time, they became indifferent to it.

Only those newcomers who went to take Xiao Cheng's classes complained bitterly.

It was well-known that Mr. President's dedication level was one of the highest in the entire industry.

So, when he was a part-time teacher, Xiao Cheng was very strict with his students.

Though it was hard work, the rewards were substantial.

At least Xiao Cheng discovered two promising talents and promptly informed the head of the entertainment department.

The head of the department, looking at Xiao Cheng who had come to speak to him, snorted, ”The media are guessing that you teaching newbies recently means Weicheng is planning to put you on ice.“

Xiao Cheng was calm, ”Let them guess.“

The department head clicked his tongue, ”Your fans are almost in an uproar.“

Xiao Cheng thought for a moment, ”There's a premiere of Director Xu's film tonight. What can I do? Like a clarification?“

”No need for clarification.“ The department head opened his file folder and flipped through it, ”Fortunately, there's a good live-streaming platform that wants to collaborate with us. You might as well do a live stream before the premiere to chat with the fans.“

Xiao Cheng had no objections.

After all, any leaks lately were always at the PR department's indication. The people in that department who manipulated public opinion were much more professional than him.

In things he was not good at, Mr. President knew how to let go.

However, Xiao Cheng still wanted to reveal a bit more. He asked, ”Can I talk about my love life?“

The department head stared at Xiao Cheng for a long time, ”… What are you going to say?“

”Just general chitchat.“ Xiao Cheng looked at the department head's suspicious expression as he pinched his file folder lightly, ”Rest assured, I won't joke about Mr. President.“

The department head remained silent for a while, put away his file folder, and took a few steps back, carefully observing Xiao Cheng.

Finally, under Xiao Cheng's gaze, he nodded, ”I'll give you another chance.“

Xiao Cheng, hearing this, confirmed the platform with the department head and directly took out his phone to send a Weibo message.

Xiao Cheng: Heard you all miss me [smiling], live stream at 8:00 tonight for the new film premiere. I'll start at 6 PM, platform link here → [live stream address]

This was the first time Xiao Cheng directly notified the audience of an event after revealing his relationship at a press conference.

The fans spread the news and were very excited.

Mr. President was sitting in his office and saw Xiao Cheng's message as soon as he opened Weibo.

A live stream before the premiere?

Wei Zhiren glanced at the schedule Xiao Tezhuli had prepared for Xiao Cheng, propping his face up, his fingertips tapping the mouse intermittently, finally focusing on the address of the premiere venue.

He decided to do something big.

…

After dinner, Xiao Cheng went directly to the premiere venue with Liu Xiaomai.

Avoiding the media gathered outside the main entrance, Mr. President and his agent entered the venue through a special passage.

Liu Xiaomai looked at the time, ”It's 5:50. We can start the live stream.“

”Go ahead,“ Xiao Cheng said casually, ”Use your phone.“

Liu Xiaomai already knew the outcome and rolled his eyes, opening the live-streaming app, sending the address to Xiao Cheng, who then posted it on Weibo.

Many fans had been refreshing Xiao Cheng's Weibo for half an hour in anticipation, ready to enter the live stream, so the chat and donations flooded the live stream room as soon as Xiao Cheng posted his message.

Xiao Cheng and Liu Xiaomai were still figuring out how to live-stream.

”Is there a video feed?“ Liu Xiaomai asked.

Xiao Cheng looked at the app he had opened on his phone to test the live stream, ”Yes, the sound is also normal.“

Hearing this, the agent took two steps back, creating some distance, holding his phone up to Xiao Cheng's face.

Mr. President smiled at the camera, waving.

”Hello everyone, I'm at the premiere backstage, getting ready for my makeup. Let's do it while we chat.“

The chat room was filled with enthusiastic greetings and countless praises for Xiao Cheng's looks.

Director Xu, being one of the top directors in the country, did not stint on expenses even for award-nominated films with low box office potential, choosing a large venue for the premiere.

So, the path Xiao Cheng took to the backstage dressing room was quite long.

Xiao Cheng and Liu Xiaomai walked forward while selecting questions to answer from the chat room.

”Stop asking who my partner is. I won't say until he agrees.“

”How did I meet my love?“ Xiao Cheng saw this question and smiled, ”It's a tragic love. We've known each other for over ten years.“


Chapter 72:
”He is very handsome, always maintaining a stern expression to enhance his authority, but in reality, he is extremely lively and unrestrained.“

”He has excellent work capabilities and has reached the upper echelons of the company at a rather young age.“

”He is also quite shy; a slight provocation will set him off, and whenever he feels embarrassed, his face turns as red as a tomato, his words become incoherent, and when he doesn't know what to say, he will assume a cold expression and pretend to ignore you.“

”He seems to be a particularly aloof person, but in reality, he is extremely soft-hearted, impulsive, and protective of those close to him.“

Xiao Cheng looked at the neatly arranged rejection messages on the live stream chat and his smile grew even brighter.

”In summary…“ Xiao Yinhudi evaded several busy staff members, walked to a door, looked up to confirm the number, and, after confirming it was his dressing room, turned to the camera, ”In summary, he is truly very good.“

After Xiao Cheng finished speaking, he pushed open the door to the dressing room, and his expression immediately blanked out.

Inside the room, there was a large rectangular gift box placed sideways, about as tall as a person, with the wrapped side facing the door. A card written in black marker read ”To Xiao Cheng“ was attached to the box.

Xiao Yinhudi was bewildered for a while before turning to look at Liu Xiaomai, who also had a bewildered expression.

A flood of question marks and messages indicating that they had taken screenshots of Xiao Cheng's bewildered face filled the live stream chat.

”This… could it be an incident during the performance?“ Xiao Cheng was somewhat uncertain, ”Who sent this?“

Liu Xiaomai was also very uncertain: ”I don't know, no one told me.“

The chat was urging him to open the gift.

”I keep feeling like there might be hidden cameras in here,“ Xiao Cheng carefully surveyed the room, ”Is this some kind of prank show?“

Liu Xiaomai glanced at the chat: ”If it's a prank show, won't you open it?“

”I will, why won't I?“ Without hesitation, Xiao Cheng walked up and tore off the wrapping paper.

The packaging was not very tight, and Xiao Cheng could smell a faint, fresh floral fragrance from it.

Xiao Yinhudi squinted his eyes, held the box lid up, took two steps back, and then threw it to the side.

The chat instantly exploded.

Inside the box was a Yixi Monkey made with roses of different colors.

Because the entire box was placed vertically, each flower's center was secured with a transparent nail. After the lid was opened, only a few petals fell.

Xiao Cheng looked at the monkey, blinked lightly, and instantly burst out laughing: ”I know who sent this.“

There was a card hanging from the tip of the monkey's tail.

Xiao Cheng took the card, trying hard to suppress the sweetness in his heart and the smile on his face, but he could not do so.

Liu Xiaomai looked at the rapidly increasing chat and reminded Xiao Cheng: ”Your fans want to see that card.“

”Okay.“ Xiao Cheng nodded, holding the card in front of the camera.

The fans behind the screen finally saw the words on the card.

Doctor Monkey, I heard you're having a live stream today :)

I'm sending you a big gift package to scare you! It's as if I'm right beside you!

=33333= Love you~[heart]

The author has something to say: Xiao Cheng: Oh my, that really scared me :)

Wei Zhenzhen: Who's better at showing affection? :)

Fan: Cold dog food being slapped on my face randomly.



Xiao Cheng's girlfriend: I think I need to change my ID, I'm rejecting this bowl of dog food (╯‵□′)╯︵┻━┻ Jenny Transdimensional Love for Cheng Cheng: That makes sense, such a bold way of showing affection, I think the shy little softie that my boyfriend mentioned must have been dreamed up! [You don't think I'll show affection and you won't hit me.jpg]

I Cheng Beautiful: I understand the reasoning, but right now I want to know what Doctor Monkey is, please explain, thank you!

Xiao Cheng and Wei Zhenzhen's affectionate display was spectacular, scaring a large group of onlookers.

Liu Xiaomai looked at the chat, unsure about who Doctor Monkey was, only knowing that this title must be related to Xiao Cheng's QQ nickname.

Liu Xiaomai remembered that Xiao Cheng had named the little black monkey after seeing Wei Zhenzhen's blurry black skin photo.

”The fans are asking you, what is Doctor Monkey?“

Xiao Yinhudi paused, kissed the card in his hand, turned his head, and smiled warmly at the camera: ”I know you're watching, I received the gift and I like it very much.“

”And, Doctor Monkey is our little affectionate game, you're not allowed to say it.“

The fans angrily swallowed the dog food, then flooded the screen with ”Okay, okay, okay,“ Cheng Cheng's baby said whatever he said was what it was.

Liu Xiaomai thought that Xiao Cheng's fans were already beyond saving.

The manager let the makeup artist who had followed them into the room and instructed, ”Sit down, let's chat while you do your makeup.“

Xiao Yinhudi responded and carefully moved the one-person-tall gift box from the center of the dressing room to the side, covered it up again, and sat in front of the makeup station, tilting his face slightly to cooperate with the makeup artist.

He decided to take it home and find a way to preserve and frame it, placing it in the living room.

Xiao Cheng was pondering where in the living room it would be most appropriate to place it.

While Liu Xiaomai was reading out the questions from the chat.

Questions about Xiao Cheng's mysterious love interest, his future plans, concerns about whether Xiao Cheng would really retire, and inquiries about the type of the new movie.

Xiao Cheng answered the fans’ questions one by one, just as he had done in previous interviews, and when he heard the last question, he looked up at Liu Xiaomai, who was holding his phone and filming behind him in the mirror, and answered seriously, ”The new movie is a complete artistic film, the tone is very oppressive, and the ending is not pleasing, so don't have too high expectations, and don't force yourself to watch it, otherwise, you might feel depressed for a very long time after watching.“

I Cheng Heavenly Beauty: With that said, I want to watch it even more orz

You're that handsome: I want to watch it +1

Fan One Explodes, Fan Two Explodes: Then people like me who have intermittent mood swings should probably not watch it…

Xiao Cheng reiterated that those who cannot handle oppressive plots should not watch it, then turned to answer other questions,顺便 sharing some funny stories from filming.

Liu Xiaomai stared at the chat, suddenly exclaiming ”Eh?“

Xiao Cheng looked at him.

”The company's official microblog has been updated,“ Liu Xiaomai took Xiao Cheng's phone, opened Weibo, and placed it in front of him.

Weicheng Film and Television Official Microblog: Regarding the recent concern over our company actor Xiao Cheng's relationship, Weicheng officially declares: We support all genuine and heartfelt free love! Thank you for your attention and understanding!

Xiao Cheng: ”…“

That makes sense, they are genuinely and freely in love.

Xiao Yinhudi exclaimed ”Wow“ and then looked away, no longer reading.

One by one, the fans went to check the Weibo, and the chat exploded again.

Xiao Cheng's girlfriend's girlfriend: Oh ho, Weicheng Company is really at the forefront of the times, supporting free love…

Cheng Cheng's Underwear: Red red fire fire, I give this free love a hundred percent, I'm not afraid of him being proud!

Bofu Jun's Moth: Let me translate Weicheng's official statement: Xiao Cheng is just talking to a girlfriend, what's the big deal, just look at you all making such a fuss!

Humph: Making such a fuss, clearly a son of Bofu.

Cheng Cheng's Belly Button: That useless paparazzo still hasn't taken a picture of my Cheng's girlfriend, I'm so angry, I fell down and only got up after Cheng Cheng kissed me.

Xiao Cheng glanced at Liu Xiaomai who was reading out the chat, then coldly said, ”No kiss, lie down.“

Liu Xiaomai: ”…“

Brother, you're my brother.

Is that how you treat your fans?

Such a big deal for a kiss?

Xiao Cheng frowned in difficulty, then maintained his stern expression and said solemnly, ”That's not possible, my kisses are for my girlfriend.“

You See Cows Flying in the Sky: Xiao Yinhudi is showing so much affection, I don't think he's afraid of the awkwardness of breaking up.

”Xiaomai, I think you need to improve your selection of chat messages,“ Xiao Cheng thought that such negative messages should not enter his ears.

The manager felt it was necessary to clarify their stance: ”There are more unpleasant messages that I haven't read yet.“


Chapter 73:
”Oh, then I shall answer directly. If I were to part ways with my lover—of course, if it were to happen in the future, it might be a divorce—if such a thing were to occur, it would certainly be my fault, with no relation to my lover.“

”Now we are very sweet together. Do not speak nonsense. I worked hard to win him over, and if you were to drive him away…“ Xio Cheng stretched his face, as if to say, ’What can you do?‘

Xio Cheng streamed for about forty minutes, talking to his fans about various topics but never addressing the key issues. He even subtly promoted Director Xu's new film, causing many media personnel waiting in the live stream room to grind their teeth.

Today's efforts to catch a fish with salt yielded nothing but salt once again. 🤪

Following the premiere of the new film, it was immediately released in theaters. Thanks to Director Xu's extensive network, the film managed to secure more than five showings per day across various cinemas. After that, the number of showings would be adjusted based on the box office figures of the first three days.

The release date was set for the weekend. Emperor of Cinema, Xio Yǐng, had no high hopes for the box office performance of the film. He was currently snuggling and fondling his lover in the office where President Wei was working overtime.

Wei Zhiren was about to be driven mad by the clingy Emperor of Cinema.

He propped his elbow against Xio Cheng's stomach and pushed him away, ”Get away from me! Don't disturb my work!“

”I won't leave,“ Xio Cheng pulled over a chair and sat beside President Wei, leaning his face towards the desk where Wei Zhiren was working, ”When are we going to pick out a ring?“

”I think you should give me the ring as a surprise, Doctor Hou,“ Wei Zhiren pushed Xio Cheng away with his head, intending to say more when Xio Cheng's phone rang.

The Emperor of Cinema, hearing the word ’surprise‘ from President Wei, looked at him thoughtfully.

Wei Zhiren looked bewildered, ”What are you looking at me for? I'm going to answer the phone.“

Xio Cheng nodded and took out his phone.

Wei Zhiren glanced at the caller ID, it was a call from M Country, an unfamiliar number.

”Who is it?“ Wei Zhiren asked.

”I don't know. I didn't leave my domestic number with anyone in M Country,“ Xio Cheng glanced at the wall clock, it was already ten at night, which meant it was morning in M Country.

Xio Cheng answered the call.

It was a director he had worked with before.

Xio Cheng looked at President Wei and softly informed him of the caller, then got up and walked into the break room.

The director first discussed the promotion of the new film with Xio Cheng, then talked about the reviews of the recent artistic films Xio Cheng had acted in worldwide, and finally asked if Xio Cheng was interested in working with him on a new film.

Xio Cheng originally wanted to tell the director to contact the company, but then he thought about the different actor management models in the West compared to China, and silently swallowed his words.

It was impossible to say that an international director's new film did not hold any allure for Xio Cheng.

Although he did not have high aspirations for his film career, when such an opportunity presented itself, it was indeed difficult to refuse.

Xio Cheng remained silent for a long time, then turned to look at President Wei, who was still working at his desk without lifting his head, and finally sighed deeply, pressing his lips tightly.

”I am very grateful for the opportunity you have given me,“ Xio Cheng's voice was calm, ”But unfortunately, after our film is released, I will find a suitable time to come out of the closet. You should know how much impact this will have.“

And whether these impacts would be positive or negative was truly impossible to fully predict.

The person on the other end of the line was silent for a while before emitting a faint snort, ”Xio, you are a very talented actor. I know many gay people in the industry who, although they have not come out, are equally loving. This does not affect anything.“

”But I hope I can hold hands, walk, and kiss my lover openly anywhere,“ Xio Cheng said.

”But Xio, you need to know that your career is progressing rapidly. Opening up the international film market is a very valuable opportunity for any Chinese actor. If you miss this chance…“

”My career can be rebuilt, but my lover and my love should not bear this injustice,“ Xio Cheng interrupted the director.

”I am probably out of the picture for your new film. Thank you for your consideration, and I deeply apologize.“



Wei Zhiren looked at the Emperor of Cinema, who seemed calm as if nothing had happened, and casually asked, ”What was it?“

The Emperor of Cinema looked at his lover without letting go.

When Wei Zhiren felt uncomfortable and tried to look away, Xio Cheng leaned over and took off the glasses from President Wei's nose bridge.

Wei Zhiren did not avoid it. He let Xio Cheng take his glasses and frowned slightly, ”What's the matter?“

The Emperor of Cinema licked his lips and asked seriously, ”Hey, I have a question.“

”Is work more important, or are you more important?“

Wei Zhiren: ”…?“

What?

Is my god recently on drugs?

President Wei looked at his lover silently, full of confusion.

”Tell me, am I more important, or is work more important?“ The Emperor of Cinema asked again.

Wei Zhiren reflexively reached out to push his glasses, but finding nothing, he pursed his lips and retorted, ”I built my entire company for you. So, is work more important, or are you more important?“

The Emperor of Cinema smiled in satisfaction, ”You are more important.“

Wei Zhiren: ”…?“

Only my god, this self-confident man, could say such shameless words so bluntly.

President Wei did not know whether to feel proud or embarrassed.

”I just declined the director's new film offer,“ Xio Cheng said.

Wei Zhiren was startled, ”From M Country?“

”Yes,“ Xio Cheng nodded lightly, putting the glasses back on Wei Zhiren.

Wei Zhiren got anxious upon hearing this, ”Why did you decline it? Such a good opportunity!“

”Because if I accepted the offer, we would have to postpone our public announcement,“ Xio Cheng placed the documents on Wei Zhiren's desk, ”Get back to work. There's one last thing left to do. Once it's done, let's go get some night snacks at the cafeteria.“

”No,“ Wei Zhiren felt slightly annoyed at Xio Cheng's casual attitude.

That was an offer from M Country!

In the domestic industry, everyone would fight tooth and nail to get such an opportunity!

Wei Zhiren looked at Xio Cheng, ”The timing of this announcement doesn't matter, but this opportunity is important for you…“

”To me, you are more important.“

Xio Cheng interrupted Wei Zhiren and added,

”You are more important to me than any film offer. Besides, I am not overly attached to my acting career.“

Wei Zhiren lowered his eyes, looking at the documents in front of him without speaking.

”You don't need to feel guilty about it, Zhiren,“ Xio Cheng's forehead gently touched Wei Zhiren's, ”I love you and am willing to do anything for you. It's my choice, not your fault.“

President Wei silently turned the pages of the documents, and after a long time, when he confirmed everything was correct, he pursed his lips.

Then, under the gaze of the Emperor of Cinema, he muttered, ”Do whatever you want, as long as you're happy.“

The tone still sounded unhappy.

Wei Zhiren cared more about Xio Cheng's acting career than Xio Cheng did, mainly because his understanding and knowledge of Xio Cheng were largely based on his acting identity.

But now that they were in a relationship, it was not appropriate to impose his own perceptions onto his partner.

”Not entirely impossible,“ Wei Zhiren thought, changing his tone.

”But you need to let me know how many assets you will have left if you lose your acting career,“ President Wei signed his name at the end of the document, ”At least, let me have a rough idea of the cost of supporting you.“

Didn't Wei Zhiren know how much investment Xio Cheng had?

Of course he did. After all, the investment industry was the Wei family's main business. With a little effort, Xio Cheng's actions would be clearly displayed before Wei Zhiren.

Xio Cheng also knew that Wei Zhiren must be very clear about how much wealth he still had.

So he coughed lightly, slightly complying with President Wei's desire to support him, and replied, ”Actually, after I lose my acting job, I will have nothing left.“

Wei Zhiren placed the last document carefully and turned to look at the Emperor of Cinema sitting beside him, letting out a light hum, ”At least your face is still good enough.“


Chapter 74:
Xiao Yingtai took Wei Zongcai's hand and rubbed it against his face, smiling and saying, ”Then I shall certainly take good care of my face so as not to disappoint my True True.“

Wei Zitrue casually grabbed him, saying, ”Come, come, come, let's go for some midnight snacks.“

Just as Mr. President rose, Xiao Yingtai followed suit, casually grabbing Mr. President as well.

But he did not touch his face; instead, he pinched his buttocks.

Wei Zitrue halted his steps, turned his head to glare at Xiao Cheng, his face turning red, and exclaimed, ”This is sexual harassment!“

Xiao Yingtai was shameless: ”Not at all. You are my partner. This is not harassment; this is flirting.“

Wei Zitrue: ”……“

You are so annoying!

You have changed!

You are no longer the aloof Cheng of our family!

Mr. President sobbed loudly, feeling both sorrowful and excited by the Xiao Yingtai he saw before him.

…

The final box office figures for Director Xu's new film were not a massive hit, but they did surprise many.

This film, which questioned human dignity and the coldness of the world, had a gloomy opening and a tragic ending, with a consistently dim tone throughout. It managed to earn over nine and a half million yuan during its run, which was truly astonishing.

The film received very high praise on many film review websites, with excellent word-of-mouth, but did not receive the same level of enthusiastic endorsement from fans as his previous commercial films.

The most common feedback from fans was: ”What Cheng said during his live stream was all true. Those with low psychological tolerance should definitely avoid watching it.“

Some fans even believed that the film should not have passed the censors, as it was overwhelmingly heartbreaking and gloomy, and did not cater to the main theme. It felt more like a documentary.

Regardless of the reviews, the final box office figures were still quite impressive among similar films.

Director Xu was particularly delighted, pulling in the investors, producers, and crew members for a big meal at a hotel, and then happily went to attend the awards ceremony with the film.

After the film ended, Xiao Cheng once again entered a busy promotion phase.

The movie trailer for M.Country had been released, and promotion had already begun in North America. Of course, domestic promotion was necessary as well, and sometimes Xiao Cheng had to fly to M.Country to assist with the promotion.

Wei Zitrue sat in his office, watching JM Show on his computer. JM Show was a highly popular talk show in M.Country, and whenever a new film was released, those with the opportunity would appear on JM Show for a segment.

This particular video clip was specially cut by Xiao Cheng's fans, translated, and posted on Weibo.

Mr. President watched halfway through and pulled the progress bar forward.

The host asked the director, ”This time, you bravely cast a Chinese actor, Xiao Cheng. Unfortunately, he couldn't make it to the show. I heard he's a very good person. What do you think of Xiao?“

The director paused for a moment, then spread his hands and said, ”Xiao is indeed a very good person. I want to collaborate with him on my next film.“

The host exclaimed, ”That's quite a nice review.“

”Yes.“ The director nodded, seemingly unable to contain himself and started talking freely, ”Xiao was introduced to me by a friend. He was truly astonishing—likely a common trait among Chinese people, he is very hardworking and talented. He even self-studied many directors’ courses, and many scenes in this film were improved based on his suggestions.“

The host made an astonished expression, ”But I heard Xiao has been in the news lately?“

”It's not rumors, but he's really in a relationship and seems to be preparing for marriage,“ the director said, unable to help but laugh, ”Actually, I had already called Xiao before that. He rejected my offer for the new film.“

The host was truly shocked.

”He has high national pride in Heavenly China, so when news of his relationship came out, many people criticized him. Considering the situation, he didn't disclose his partner's identity or situation. I advised him to try to hide it, but what he said then surprised me greatly.“

The director made a gesture of holding a phone to his ear, cleared his throat, lowered his voice, and impersonated Xiao Cheng with a stern face, saying, ”A career can be rebuilt, but my love, my affection should not bear this injustice.“

After finishing, the director made an exaggerated, incredulous expression, ”And because of the recent negative news, Xiao was kind enough to reject me.“

”But I don't mind this rejection,“ the director moved his chubby body, ”Love can happen to anyone at any time, and there's nothing wrong with it. Talented actors should not be denied because of popularity or relationships. I am always waiting for Xiao to change his mind—before I start shooting my new film.“

After that, Wei Zitrue could no longer hear what the director said.

All he could think about was the words the director had just imitated in Xiao Cheng's voice.

There is no one else.

Wei Zitrue thought.

No one else would refuse such a tempting opportunity for him.

No one else would say such things in front of others.

No one else would give up everything for him without hesitation, just to ensure he wasn't wronged.

Really, there is no one else.

Mr. President stared blankly at the computer screen, blinking his slightly teary eyes, then suddenly stood up and rushed out with his coat.

After Xiao Cheng finished the show and got into the car, he saw Wei Zongcai sitting in the backseat, staring intently at him.

Xiao Yingtai paused, then silently got into the car.

”Why did you suddenly come over without telling me?“ Xiao Cheng said, taking off his sunglasses.

Mr. President looked at Xiao Yingtai for a long time, then pulled out his credit card from his pocket and tugged on Xiao Cheng's sleeve.

Xiao Yingtai turned his head and glanced at the card Wei Zitrue handed over, ”What?“

Mr. President was embarrassed, ”This is my credit card. There's a lot of money, and more comes in every month. It's definitely enough to support you.“

Xiao Yingtai nodded, looking puzzled.

”So!“ Wei Zitrue straightened his back, staring intently at his lover, ”So! Will you marry me?“



Then, under the pretense that Wei Zitrue needed more rest, he sent him home evasively.

Wei Ming returned home on time for once, turned on the living room light, and saw a ball of Little True Brother huddled on the sofa, pretending to be a cushion.

Mother Wei was not home, nor was the housekeeper.

Big Brother Ming stood beside the sofa, tilting his head to look at the ball of Little True Brother, feeling puzzled, ”What are you up to today?“

The rejected Mr. President felt life was no longer worth living.

He did not move a muscle, answering in a闷 voice, ”I am a cushion spirit today.“

Wei Ming: ”……“

What the hell is a cushion spirit.

Believe me, I'll sit on you and crush you.

But while he thought about it, Big Brother Ming could not bring himself to sit on Little True Brother.

He tugged at his tie, offering his brother some comfort, ”Have you eaten?“

Wei Zitrue's voice was still muffled, ”Cushion spirits don't need to eat.“

”Alright, you're addicted,“ Wei Ming knew right away that Wei Zitrue had not eaten, ”Get up, go eat.“

Wei Zitrue hugged himself tighter, ”Eee.“

Big Brother Ming was shocked by this ”eee“, gasping, ”What are you ’eee'ing about? I still need to eat.“

Wei Zitrue was pulled off the sofa by his brother as if he had no bones, his face showing a ”QAQ“ expression.

”My proposal was rejected! The cushion spirit doesn't want to live QAQ!“

Little True Brother looked at Big Brother Ming, wanting to cry loudly.

Wei Ming was stunned, ”Who did you propose to?“

”Who else?“ Wei Zitrue held a pillow, looking aggrieved, ”My boyfriend.“

Wei Ming gave a surprised ”Eh,“ thinking it was impossible.

If his brother had proposed to Xiao Cheng, Xiao Cheng should have jumped in joy.

Little Detective Ming frowned, thinking for a moment, then pulled the pillow out of Little True Brother's arms, standing him up from the sofa, and asked, ”How did you propose?“

Wei Zitrue, hearing this, huffed angrily, then pulled out his credit card, ”Ming, ask yourself, do you think proposing with a credit card lacks sincerity?“

Wei Ming: ”……“

This…

Big Brother Ming did not want to speak.

Big Brother Ming felt a bit sorry for Xiao Cheng.


Chapter 75:
Brother Senior, upon his silence, Wei Zhiren was about to start a commotion: ”You say! Do you lack sincerity?!“

”You are sincere, you are sincere.“ Little Ming Brother pulled his brother, who was about to throw a tantrum, up from the sofa, ”Xiao Cheng's refusal of you is his failure to recognize a great opportunity; we are not playing along with him.“

”You actually say that my boyfriend lacks the ability to recognize a great opportunity! If you say that about him, I'm going to be furious!“ Wei Zhiren, while straightening his clothes, felt extremely angry.

Wei Ziming: ”…“

You are really annoying.

Wei Ziming was too tired to bother with Wei Zhiren and turned around to leave, driving his car out of the garage where he had just parked it.

Today, Little Ming Brother successfully convinced his brother to go out for dinner together.

…

Liu Xiaomai felt she could laugh at Xiao Cheng's bewildered expression for an entire year.

The Emperor of Acting was helpless towards the CEO who could change his mind like the weather.

He glanced at his agent, who was driving while chuckling softly, and frowned, ”Why are you laughing? I'm about to get married, did you catch up with Qing Sister? Ah?“

”You're not fun like this, Ah Cheng,“ Liu Xiaomai was already immune to the Emperor of Acting's attacks and, despite herself, laughed again at the scene, ”Oh, I really think Mr. Wei is particularly adorable hahaha!“

The Emperor of Acting turned away, clearly disdainful.

Liu Xiaomai laughed until she could no longer, looked up at the green light, and pressed the accelerator, ”Didn't you go to book the engagement ring earlier? When are you planning to propose?“

”Let's see how it goes,“ the Emperor of Acting looked out the window and sighed heavily, ”The design is just starting.“

”You'll have to handle it yourself now; the resources I have at my disposal can't be of much help anymore. Do as you please.“

Liu Xiaomai, now the Golden Broker of Weicheng, was busy and glamorous.

”Recently, a few of the new talents under me are doing well; if you have any resources, give them a helping hand.“

Xiao Cheng responded indifferently.

Xiao Cheng had also been very busy lately, often flying back and forth domestically and internationally to promote the big summer movie. He was practically on a non-stop rotation like a wheel.

And because he was always followed by a few paparazzi, he couldn't find Wei Zhiren openly.

— Except when he was at the Weicheng headquarters.

Unfortunately, Xiao Cheng had been flying all over recently, spending little time in B City. Today, he happened to be in B City to pick up a show because he had a flight to M Country in the evening.

Xiao Cheng pinched his brow, ”Remember to check if he was photographed when I dropped him off.“

Liu Xiaomai made a reassuring gesture.

However, the Weicheng Public Relations Department had guarded all media channels day and night, only to be foiled by a fan of Xiao Cheng who lived in the same neighborhood as Wei Zhiren.

My mother! I saw the license plate number Xiao Cheng often uses parked outside my door today and was scared out of my wits. Although a handsome young man got out, I still saw Xiao Cheng in the car, as well as Brother Xiaomai! [Dog] First time being so close to my idol hahaha [picture][picture][picture]

Under this tweet, a group of bloggers were howling about how lucky they were to catch the idol's happiness. Because of the presence of their agent, no one initially thought about other possibilities, and no trend was formed.

Until someone revealed that the ”handsome young man“ in the picture was actually a blur of Xiao Cheng's friend from his vacation, who had been captured in the background of a previous photograph.

The new photograph was very clear.

And although Wei Zhiren did not often participate in media promotions, there were still some of his photos circulating on the internet.

Thus, with this revelation, Wei Zhiren's identity was completely uncovered.

President of Weicheng, Director of Lanxin Group… ultimately, his online persona as a fan, Zhiren Zhiren, was exposed.

The fans who had watched the entire process were stunned.

While the fan community felt surprised, there was no negative sentiment; in fact, the fans even said that Mr. Zhiren had truly reached the pinnacle of being a fan.

Actually, if you carefully look into it, the registration date of Weicheng Film Department was exactly six months before Xiao Cheng's contract with Guangying was due to expire. It started operating about one and a half months before the contract was terminated, which means it was launched immediately after confirming Xiao Cheng's intentions. Thinking about it this way… [extremely terrified eyes.jpg]

Same feeling of terror; this basically means the Film Department was established specially for me, orz! No wonder after going to Weicheng, I've been so reckless and free, but haven't been hindered by the company… My god, I kneel down in front of Mr. Zhiren's suit pants.

I checked Mr. Zhiren's Weibo and the information about Weicheng, verifying the timeline, and I discovered a big secret. [picture]

As shown in the picture, before Weicheng had a Film Department, the Investment Department had a film investment project from time to time. After a careful check, I found that they were all Xiao Cheng's films. Apart from cameo appearances, even extras were not spared; they started from his debut, even including some dramas I've never heard of… Following the list of dramas, a bunch of Xiao Cheng's [struck out] dark history [struck out] painful early days.

Scanning through Mr. Zhiren's Weibo, it only exploded twice. The first time was when eight circles said that Xiao Cheng's fans were actually fans of Mr. Zhiren 23333, and the second time was when Guangying's that mad dog bit him because his contract with Xiao Cheng expired and was terminated. He even changed his certification to正面肛狗 23333, saying he wouldn't believe anyone who claims it's not true love.

…Hurry, come over and support me!

Damn, I suddenly feel insignificant; they are the real fans.

Wait, why didn't anyone suspect that their relationship is improper! [Troublemaking.jpg]

Reply to @Xiao Cheng Family's Little Kitten: Improper relationship…? Do you mean to say that our Xiao Cheng is actually the Young Miss of Lanxin? [Do you see my forty-meter-long sword.jpg]

Hahahahaahaha Lanxin Young Miss 6666

Young Miss, I'm impressed! After accepting this setting, it feels really realistic!

Let's just come up with some trouble. The only issue now is: When Xiao Cheng said that the boss of Weicheng is his long-time friend in a live stream, Mr. Zhiren clarified on his Weibo that he only checked in once without further contact. Come on, everyone, who is spreading lies? Xiao Cheng or Zhiren? If there's something undisclosed, like you being my long-sought Juliet (?), the house will take it all! @Zhiren Zhiren, Mr. Idol, come out and give a speech!

…



Chapter 63

Liu Xiaomai and the Public Relations Depart

ment discovered this tweet when the heat was just starting.

Since it had already spread far and the blogger was an experienced fan who could steer the direction of the trend, they did not immediately delete the tweet. Instead, they waited for the heat to rise and then joined the fans in setting the tone.

Xiao Cheng's critics were not too numerous, but due to his recent frequent promotions and his participation in an international blockbuster, many fans of the competition and Guangying had become his casual critics, ready to criticize him whenever they saw him.

As a result, the heat of the situation quickly soared.

The blogger, frightened, sought help from Liu Xiaomai's account, which she had used as a ”fan leader,“ worried that she might have caused trouble for Xiao Cheng.

And after discussing with the Public Relations Department, Liu Xiaomai decided to push Wei Zhiren forward.

After all, both of them were going to come out of the closet anyway, so they might as well take this opportunity to stir things up and gauge the fans’ acceptance.

So, Liu Xiaomai assured the blogger that everything was fine and, together with the Public Relations Department, they decisively pushed their superior to the front line to take the fall.

The Public Relations Department, knowing the ins and outs, understood that the person Weicheng could not offend was not the head of operations, Wei Zhiren, but the sleeping Xiao Cheng on the plane.

So, there was no need to worry about Wei Zhiren being unwilling to take the fall for Xiao Cheng.

The CEO, upon knowing about it, would probably praise them for doing a good job. Stirring up the ”best friend“ setting to gain the fans’ acceptance would be immensely beneficial for coming out of the closet.

Wei Zhiren found out about the situation only after he arrived at the company.

The CEO looked bewildered at his Weibo, which had been filled with new information, and then looked up at Liu Xiaomai, who was reporting her work.

”They exposed me?“ Wei Zhiren was still a bit confused.

Liu Xiaomai nodded, ”We also promoted you after giving you some packaging.“

Wei Zhiren was stunned, ”I'm debuting?“

The agent was speechless, feeling that their CEO was a bit silly.


Chapter 76:
But he still shook his head honestly, ”Not what you think. It's just that after the promotion, your image will be more concrete, and besides, you and Xiao Cheng will be…“

Liu Xiaomai stopped there, and Wei Zhenzhen understood.

Mr. President pushed his glasses up, nodded, and opened the file on his computer: ”You continue working. I'll take a look.“

Liu Xiaomai quickly left.

Wei Zhenzhen carefully and meticulously read through the file and the微博 posts.

Mr. President found that he had trended on the热搜, not only that, but the Public Relations Department had beautified him with various filters, praising his dedication, extraordinary abilities, and how he had single-handedly supported the company during its most difficult times. Wei Zhenzhen was stunned, even feeling a bit embarrassed.

After finishing, he glanced at the time and realized it was only around ten o'clock, so he decided to put the matter aside and concentrate on his work.

It was not until lunchtime that Wei Zhenzhen slowly dragged out the webpage and forwarded the initial微博 post that had revealed the photos.

ZhenzhenZhenzhen: I think I'm rather handsome and charming as well. Thank you for the compliment.

After posting, he did not care about the reactions of the fans waiting in ambush, closed the webpage, and went to the cafeteria with his phone. Upon arriving, he discovered that the people in the cafeteria were paying him an unusually high level of attention.

Wei Zhenzhen's face tightened in nervousness.

He surveyed the room, pushing back those gazes, and seemed rather unhappy as he slightly frowned. With a cold expression, he picked up… two strawberry cream cakes.

Mr. President sat in the cafeteria, eating the two cakes with an expressionless yet graceful demeanor. After finishing his coffee, which was loaded with sugar cubes and cream, he fled hastily.

ZhenzhenZhenzhen: F*ck, fuck, fuck, Doctor Monkey! I was surprised!

ZhenzhenZhenzhen: Pah! Not surprised! Shocked! [Scared me, I hugged my little carp.jpg]

Xiao Cheng was still on the plane, watching movies on his laptop. Upon receiving Wei Zhenzhen's message, he replied instantly.

Little Black Monkey: What's going on?

ZhenzhenZhenzhen: Don't you know what happened on the微博?

ZhenzhenZhenzhen: Didn't Liu Xiaomai tell you?

Little Black Monkey: I saw it. The Public Relations Department asked me to wait before responding, to give them more time to hype it up.

Wei Zhenzhen stepped out of the elevator, put down his phone, and faced the curious stares from all over the office, feeling extremely uncomfortable.

He returned to his office and started typing furiously on the keyboard.

ZhenzhenZhenzhen: Everywhere I go, I'm being mobbed, QAQ. It's so annoying!

ZhenzhenZhenzhen: I feel so awkward.

Little Black Monkey: Fans find me awkward? [Suddenly Angry.jpg]

ZhenzhenZhenzhen: I mean being watched by others is awkward! [Suddenly Punching.jpg]

Xiao Cheng read Wei Zhenzhen's message and immediately went to communicate with the head of the Public Relations Department.

Wei Zhenzhen waited for a while without receiving a reply, so he decided to continue working, lowering his head to process his tasks.

After a long time, when Wei Zhenzhen heard the notification for a special follow-up message, he looked up to find Xiao Cheng's reply from two hours earlier.

Little Black Monkey: Let me handle it. [Gently Petting Dog Head.gif]

Mr. President was taken aback, glanced at the notification on his phone, and discovered that Xiao Cheng had posted a new微博.

Xiao Cheng: The house wins [Smiling] //@Xiao Cheng's Girlfriend's Girlfriend: Come cause trouble…

A crowd of fans was howling below, with the topic: Who is Romeo and who is Juliet among you two!

Xiao Cheng's response was very open and straightforward, stating that he had been the one to find him, and he never imagined that he would be his fan.

The fans were extremely enthusiastic in response, declaring that Cheng was now part of the aristocracy and was simply fantastic.

Wei Zhenzhen looked at the comment for a long time before realizing he needed to find Emperor Xiao.

ZhenzhenZhenzhen: Doctor Monkey, what do you want to do!? Σ( ° △°|||) Little Black Monkey: To publicly do some preliminary reconnaissance for us [Simple Smile Hints at Fatigue.jpg]

ZhenzhenZhenzhen: … Where did you get those emoticons.

Little Black Monkey: Stealing from fans on the微博. [Suddenly Bursting into Laughter.jpg]

Wei Zhenzhen: ”…“

Alright, Doctor Monkey, you've grown up.

Wei Zhenzhen was amazed by Emperor Xiao, who had stolen emoticons, and directly closed the chat window.

Xiao Cheng needed to stay in M Country for a long time, visiting all major cities, which led to domestic fans having to constantly use VPNs to find resources online. Those who could not use VPNs could only watch screen licking based on the news leaked by domestic media.

Some of the fans, who had no screen to lick, came up with mischievous ideas and went to Wei Zhenzhen's微博 to call him the incomparably handsome President Wei, then asked for Xiao Cheng's private photos.

Wei Zhenzhen collected a bunch of comments and sent them to Emperor Xiao, who, seeing them, shamelessly took a short kissing video in the hotel and sent it to Mr. President.

Mr. President, who had been kissed so boldly by Emperor Xiao, was startled. After some thought, he mercilessly took a screenshot of Emperor Xiao with his pouty lips and added text to create an emoticon, which he then posted on the微博.

ZhenzhenZhenzhen: Here, the private photos you want :) [Stolen from Xiao Cheng's girlfriend][Wanna Kiss.jpg]

Only after Xiao Cheng had finished his show did he discover that his girlfriend had posted his black-and-white photos.

Not only did she post the photos, but she also turned them into emoticons.

Emperor Xiao first openly followed Mr. President, then liked his latest微博 post.

Xiao Cheng: Fans who like me deeply naturally turn black :) You've changed. You weren't like this before. //@ZhenzhenZhenzhen: Here, the private photos you want :) [Stolen from Xiao Cheng's girlfriend][Wanna Kiss.jpg]



The interaction between Xiao Cheng and Wei Zhenzhen on the微博 was laid out for everyone to see, causing those who had intended to stir up trouble to feel extremely stifled and retreat.

—They had already said they were friends and that their relationship was very good. Forcing it would be meaningless.

Xiao Cheng's fans were always formidable, and with his recent surge in popularity and success, he had clearly distinguished himself from the majority of domestic celebrities, his fame and momentum at its peak.

With a powerful corporation as a backing, certified by a stamp on the board, even fewer people were willing to risk offending Xiao Cheng at such a high-profile moment.

However, despite the celebratory atmosphere outside, there were always sensitive individuals within the fan community who felt a profound sense of unease.

Wei Zhenzhen had been frequently receiving private messages and direct inquiries from Xiao Cheng's fans, cautiously asking about Xiao Cheng's future career path and relationships, expressing his concerns about whether Xiao Cheng would truly retire and return to his family.

Regarding such private messages and inquiries, Wei Zhenzhen could only pretend not to see them, for he was also uncertain about Xiao Cheng's plans.

Every time he asked Xiao Cheng, Emperor Xiao would smile mysteriously at Mr. President.

The Public Relations Department head, who seemed to know something, was calmly evasive.

Xiao Cheng's new film was released during the summer档, showing a strong box office trend, securing the top spot in the first week's box office, surpassing the second place by over twenty million yuan.

Such a strong box office performance led to a rapid increase in Xiao Cheng's fame and popularity, as well as an inevitable surge in reports centered around him, making the Public Relations Department of Weicheng feel overwhelmed.

They found it increasingly difficult to suppress the speculation about Xiao Cheng's personal life.

Wei Zhenzhen browsed through a pile of detailed articles and posts about the female celebrities he had collaborated with, reading them leisurely and thoroughly engrossed.

Not only that, he would occasionally take screenshots of the more suggestive poses from their photoshoots and send them to Xiao Cheng.

Emperor Xiao saw a pile of screenshots from his girlfriend as soon as he finished his show, and upon closer inspection, his heart sank.

Wei Zhenzhen did not find this behavior particularly alarming and continued to take screenshots and send them over.

Little Black Monkey: … What's going on?

ZhenzhenZhenzhen: Eh? You're off the show?

Emperor Xiao, while having his makeup removed by his makeup artist, pondered over the meaning of Mr. President's words.

It didn't seem… like he was planning to launch an investigation?

Heaven knew how distressed Xiao Cheng was when he saw those old photos on his phone.

Everyone had to be gradually polished from being sweet and naive. Those photos were indeed taken due to his inexperience and also because he had been deliberately tricked.

Emperor Xiao had already come up with a myriad of explanations in his heart, but none of them were applicable in the end.

Little Black Monkey: Why did you send these?

Zi Zhenzhen: Looking back on your black history! [Enduring Laughter.jpg]

Xiao Heihouzi: ……[A simple smile reveals a hint of fatigue.jpg]

Xiao Yingdi decided to skip over this topic.

He glanced at the mirror in front of him, touching the wedding ring box that had just been delivered to him by Xiao Xiaomai today.

Xiao Heihouzi: The Golden Phoenix Awards will be held at the end of next month.

Zi Zhenzhen: I remember you were nominated, right?

Xiao Heihouzi: Mm-hm.

Xiao Yingdi licked his lips, then after a short while, lowered his head to tap on his smartphone screen.

Xiao Heihouzi: Are you going?

Wei Zhenzhen was tidying up and preparing to leave work when he saw Xiao Cheng's question. He raised his eyebrow lightly.

Zi Zhenzhen: Actually, I always attended the ceremony whenever you were nominated in the past.

Zi Zhenzhen: Wasn't that a huge surprise? :)

Xiao Cheng looked at the two messages that popped up, curved his lips, and his face, which had been unusually stern due to makeup, softened instantly.

Xiao Heihouzi: Yeah.

Zi Zhenzhen: I'm heading home after work! By the way, congratulations on your new film's opening day box office almost breaking a billion!

Xiao Heihouzi: [Gently Petting Dog Head.gif]

……

Xiao Cheng's new film had domestic box office earnings totaling 1.4 billion, which was already an outstanding achievement among international blockbusters.

In a short time, whether it was serious media or online tabloids, there were no more voices criticizing Xiao Cheng himself. Everywhere one looked, there were only praises and commendations.

At the same time, two new actors debuting from Weicheng launched their new dramas, which were released simultaneously. Xiao Cheng took the opportunity to make a cameo appearance to promote their films, making their careers smoother. Xiao Cheng also gained a reputation for caring about his juniors.

Following that, the news of Xiao Cheng's nomination for Best Actor at the Golden Phoenix Awards spread.

It was for the nomination in Director Xu's artistic film.

Xiao Cheng was at the peak of his fame, and some interviews naturally touched on the topic of awards.

In this sensitive moment, a poorly worded statement could offend many people, but Xiao Cheng's response was with a smug smile, stating that his lover really hoped he could win another trophy.

The CEO who did not have such hopes: ”…You're lying.“

On the day before the Golden Phoenix Awards, Xiao Yingdi finally had some free time. He sat on the lazy sofa, wrapping his arms around the CEO who was holding a tablet and watching an interview from behind. ”I'll lie to them, but I won't lie to you.“

After Xiao Yingdi spoke, he buried his head in the CEO's neck and gently rubbed it.

Wei Zhenzhen scratched his neck in discomfort, then pushed his head against Xiao Yingdi's. ”Stop rubbing.“

”If not rubbing, then kissing.“ Xiao Yingdi mumbled, then sucked a bright red mark behind the CEO's ear.

The CEO hummed twice, his embarrassment reaching the point where his toes curled.

”Not going home tonight?“ Xiao Yingdi asked.

CEO Wei nodded, ”Not going home. I'll go to the awards ceremony with you tomorrow.“

Upon hearing this, Xiao Yingdi's hand slipped into the CEO's shirt, ”Then should we do something meaningful?“

The CEO threw the tablet aside and grabbed Xiao Yingdi's rebellious hand, pulling it out of his shirt. ”You can do whatever you want after you win the award.“

Xiao Yingdi frowned, ”What if I don't win?“

”I don't support premarital sex.“

The CEO looked solemn—except for the redness spreading across his face.

So the next day, when Xiao Yingdi arrived at the awards ceremony and was being interviewed, his usually reserved manner instantly became determined.

Wei Zhenzhen was sitting among the investors.

He wore gold-rimmed glasses, warmly greeting the investors around him, then calmly sat next to Li Yida, who was also an investor.

Li Yida, who was not a romantic, immediately noticed Wei Zhenzhen's subtle hints of flirtation.

”Oh, wow.“ Li Yida clicked his tongue, ”You guys must have been very passionate last night.“

Wei Zhenzhen looked puzzled, ”What?“

Li Yida pointed to behind his ear, thinking that Wei Zhenzhen hadn't acted any differently when walking, and blinked. ”Did you put something there?“

If Wei Zhenzhen didn't understand by now, he was an idiot.

The proud and cold CEO Wei Zhenzhen looked at his friend with disdain. ”Daizi, you're vulgar and shallow!“

Li Yida: ”……“

?

?

How am I vulgar and shallow? Explain!

The CEO lied through his teeth. ”Mosquito bite.“

Li Yida: ”……“

Tell me the truth, do you look down on my intelligence?

Wei Zhenzhen didn't mean to, but after lying, he turned to continue chatting with others, coldly ignoring his friend.

Li Yida sat there for a long time, not getting a single glance from his friend until just before the Best Actor award was announced.

He was unwilling to give up and leaned close to Wei Zhenzhen's ear, whispering.

”I'm telling you, I have inside information. Xiao Cheng is going to win the Best Actor award.“

Then Li Yida watched in shock as Wei Zhenzhen froze.

Instantly, the usually cold CEO's calm and composed expression turned red at a visible speed.

And when the host announced that Xiao Cheng was the winner of Best Actor on stage, it reached its peak.

The author has something to say: Daizi: ?What? What happened?

Wei Zhenzhen: woc……

Xiao Cheng: I heard you don't support premarital that thing:)



”What are you blushing for?“ he asked.

Wei Zhenzhen pushed his glasses up and replied, ”Hot.“

Li Yida expressed his disbelief.

He frowned, ”Don't mess with me.“

The CEO looked at his friend with disdain. ”Stop nagging, Xiao Cheng is about to speak.“

Wei Zhenzhen watched Xiao Cheng walk up to the stage, took off his glasses, and wiped them slowly, showing no sign of the turbulent emotions inside him.

Wei Zhenzhen remembered very well what he had said to Xiao Cheng the day before.

Something about doing whatever he wanted if he won the award……

Why can't I control my mouth?

The CEO felt like he was going to break.

Xiao Cheng walked up to the stage, his gaze sweeping over the audience, pausing slightly at the investors’ section, then smiling at the camera.

Then he thanked everyone as usual, following the routine.

Wei Zhenzhen supported his face, looking at the close-up of Xiao Cheng on the big screen behind the stage, showing no sign of wavering.

It had to be admitted that after so many years in front of cameras, Xiao Cheng's close-up on the screen was a perfect image from any angle.

Wei Zhenzhen supported his face, lost in the beauty, unable to tear himself away.

And after the usual thank yous to the crew and the company, Xiao Cheng paused for a moment, holding the trophy in his hand and rubbing it.

”There must be many journalists who were very puzzled when interviewing me today.“ Xiao Cheng smiled faintly, facing the camera, ”Probably wondering why Xiao Cheng, who was very humble a few days ago, suddenly changed his tone today, acting as if he was certain to win the trophy, whether he received some inside information.“

The journalists allowed to enter the venue were as quiet as chickens.

They were indeed very puzzled.

”In fact, I didn't know in advance,“ Xiao Cheng said, raising his eyebrows slightly, ”Winning this trophy makes me very happy because my lover promised me yesterday that if I could win this trophy, he would give me a big gift.“

The CEO, who was the big gift: ”……“

”My lover is also here at this ceremony,“ Xiao Cheng finished, coughing lightly.

Wei Zhenzhen suddenly grabbed his friend by the side.

Li Yida almost jumped up in pain. ”What the hell?! What are you doing?!“

Wei Zhenzhen took a deep breath and adjusted his glasses. ”I suspect my boyfriend is planning something big.“

”What?“ Li Yida didn't understand, but as he followed Wei Zhenzhen's gaze to Xiao Cheng, he shivered.

He looked around, then leaned close to Wei Zhenzhen like a thief. ”You … are serious about Xiao Cheng?“

Full of disbelief, ”Xiao Cheng's lover, who he's always talked about, is actually you?“

Wei Zhenzhen turned to look at his friend, puzzled. ”Yes, what's wrong with that?“
