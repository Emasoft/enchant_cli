Chapter 1:
Chapter 1: The Path of Cultivation

Li Ming was an ordinary high school student living in a small, unremarkable town. Every morning, he would wake up on time and rush to school for classes.

But Li Ming had a secret, one that even he found hard to believe—he could cultivate martial arts.

In this modern society, martial arts were considered legends and fictional elements from movies. However, Li Ming discovered by accident that ancient cultivation methods were actually real.

It was a stormy night when Li Ming found an ancient book in the library.

Chapter 2: The Mysterious Technique

When Li Ming opened the ancient book, a strange energy emanated from its pages.

The book recorded a cultivation technique called "Heavenly Constellation Art," which supposedly could grant extraordinary power to those who mastered it.

Initially, Li Ming was skeptical, but when he began practicing according to the book's methods, he actually felt a warm current flowing through his body.

"This... this is real!" Li Ming's heart raced with excitement.

From that moment on, he began his journey of cultivation.

Chapter 3: Breaking Through the First Realm

After a month of diligent practice, Li Ming finally felt the signs of a breakthrough.

That night, while he was cultivating, he suddenly felt the energy in his body surging like a tide. After intense pain, he was delighted to discover that his strength had improved qualitatively.

"I did it! I really broke through the first realm!" Li Ming said excitedly.

But he also understood that this was just the beginning of his cultivation journey, with more challenges awaiting him ahead.

From then on, Li Ming's life completely changed. He was no longer an ordinary high school student but had embarked on the path to becoming a true powerhouse.
