“Thus, they decided to first reclaim the Southern Palace’s former dominion before turning on each other and dividing it among themselves.”

But their desire to cooperate did not mean others would welcome it.

The most vocal opponent was Nan Gong Fei, the Southern Palace’s distant branch. Previously allied with Su Nantian, he had hoped to use him as a spy but was instead deceived. Su Nantian never took his words seriously, nor did he acknowledge him.

Even more alarming was Su Nantian’s simultaneous efforts to undermine Wu Chuan, which he ultimately succeeded in. The thought of this made Nan Gong Fei’s blood run cold. Yet now, Su Nantian and Wu Chuan had perished together; the enemy Nan Gong Fei faced was now his sister, Nan Gong Yuyan, and his brother, Nan Gong Ping.

The saying goes: “When cranes fight, the fisherman reaps the benefit.” Nan Gong Fei had long clung to this philosophy, observing silently without interfering. He would only stir the waters when their strength waned.

But he had not anticipated that Nan Gong Lin’s misfortune would cause his brother and sister to temporarily cease hostilities, their rivalry less fierce than before. If they joined forces, they would surely turn against him, leaving no room for his interference—this was certainly not favorable news. Though the Southern Palace had begun to decline, “a lean camel is still bigger than a horse.”

Moreover, Nan Gong Fei’s own lineage had merely clung to the Southern Palace for survival. Thus, he needed to seize control of the clan swiftly, becoming its next patriarch to rebuild and strengthen it.

This was not only a concern for Nan Gong Yuyan and Nan Gong Ping; even Nan Gong Fei was devising strategies to revitalize the Southern Palace, eradicating all the rising factions in the inland port.

“Father! He truly oversteps, becoming more unbearable!”

Nan Gong Yuyan rushed to Nan Gong Lin’s bedside, gazing at her frail father. She hesitated to speak the truth but feared silence would cause further harm.

“Another of our projects has been stolen! The enemy is truly despicable!”

As she spoke, Nan Gong Yuyan grew angrier. They had fought so hard to reclaim it—only for it to be snatched away at the last moment.

“He’s truly despicable! Overstepping!”

Chapter 884: Internal Struggles

Nan Gong Yuyan cursed again, especially seeing her father’s weakened state. She felt deep sorrow. If the opponent had competed openly, they would have accepted defeat—but instead, he resorted to underhanded tactics.

His methods were crude and repulsive. Worse still, their meticulously prepared plan had been copied verbatim, as if the enemy had deliberately aimed to humiliate them. Not a single alteration was made.

What enraged Nan Gong Yuyan most was the mystery of who had infiltrated their clan, secretly leaking all their information.

This time, she had exhausted every effort to suppress the news, ensuring it did not leak. She carried the documents with her constantly, yet even this vigilance had been exploited. The more she thought about it, the angrier she became.

Especially when she realized how often this man had outmaneuvered her, as if a cat toying with a mouse. He possessed the power to destroy their Southern Palace but chose not to, instead dragging them into endless torment.

If Qi Yinzhen knew of Nan Gong Yuyan’s thoughts, he would surely applaud. He had always intended to target the Southern Palace repeatedly.

Moreover, Qi Yinzhen had vowed not to let go of the Southern Palace until he found Su Nantian, tormenting them endlessly—cutting flesh with a dull knife without granting them mercy.

“Father, we do not know who this person is or why they target us. We have never been at odds with anyone!”

Nan Gong Yuyan’s words were truthful. The Southern Palace had always maintained amicable relations, far more moderate than Wu Family’s ruthless methods. They preferred absorbing other clans into their fold, strengthening themselves against the Wu Family.

Yet this new force had emerged seemingly out of nowhere, sending operatives to investigate—only for them to vanish without a trace. No useful intelligence was gained; instead, many agents were lost.

If it were ordinary business competition, it would be one thing—but this force targeted the Southern Palace alone. It even aided others, showing no hostility toward them.

Seeing this force nurturing obscure small clans until they grew strong enough to challenge the Southern Palace, Nan Gong Yuyan felt an unbearable rage.

“Cough cough.”

Nan Gong Lin’s body had been drained, his foundation weak. The relentless pressure of recent work had left him in a state worse than before.

Lying in bed, he listened to Nan Gong Yuyan’s report, hearing the anger and frustration in her voice. His own heart was heavy with sorrow and resentment.

Like his daughter, he did not know who this person was or what they had done to offend the Southern Palace. The attack had been sudden, like mushrooms after rain—striking them unprepared.

To this day, they had not uncovered the enemy’s true identity. Each thought made him more distressed, his worries mounting endlessly.

Nan Gong Lin had lived longer than Nan Gong Yuyan and endured more hardships. He was determined to find this mysterious force, particularly the most powerful one, which would reveal its mastermind.

They had long suspected it might be Su Nantian’s doing, but after he leapt into the lotus pond and vanished without a trace, their suspicions shifted. They knew Su Nantian would have revealed himself if he were responsible.

Yet they had waited endlessly, watching their clan’s power be divided without any sign of a sudden rising family.

Instead, small clans previously overlooked had been nurtured by the enemy, growing strong enough to devour most of the Southern Palace’s projects.

To make matters worse, the Southern Palace had faced attacks from many places—customs officials intercepting their goods, causing massive losses.

They could only endure the pain silently, unable to voice their grievances or know where to direct their anger.

It felt as if they were always hunted, prey with no escape. The enemy seemed to savor the thrill of the hunt, lurking in the shadows, never revealing himself despite their efforts.

“Stay calm.”

Nan Gong Lin took several deep breaths, steadying his emotions. He slowly controlled his coughing, his face pale and gaunt, as if already half-buried.

Seeing him like this, Nan Gong Yuyan felt a deep sorrow. She knew it was their recent turmoil that had drained her father’s strength, hastening his decline.

Like a withered flower, he seemed to have little time left to bloom.

“Father, rest for a while.”

Nan Gong Yuyan consoled her father, urging him to take more rest. She reassured him: “Since the enemy refuses to reveal himself, we’ll continue waiting. I don’t believe he will remain hidden forever. Let’s wait for now.”

After all, if the enemy preferred hiding, they would stop searching. If deprived of this game, he would surely reveal himself soon.

With this thought, Nan Gong Yuyan’s expression grew resolute. She was no longer as tense as before.

“You think this way, father, I’m glad. Yuyan, you’ve truly matured. I am happy.”

Chapter 885: Plotting Countermeasures

Nan Gong Lin reached out, grasping Nan Gong Yuyan’s hand and patting it gently, as if comforting her.

Afterward, he said: “You must assist your brother more. After I’m gone, the Southern Palace will be yours and his. You must support each other; do not let your rivalry resurface.”

Nan Gong Lin knew his frail body could no longer endure long. He could only urge them to reconcile within this limited time.

He also knew Nan Gong Yuyan’s intelligence surpassed Nan Gong Ping’s, but Nan Gong Ping was steady and composed.

Previously, he had been blinded by external influences, believing the clan should be left to one of them.

But now Nan Gong Lin had realized: only by working together could they achieve the best outcome.

As for who would become the clan’s patriarch, he knew his reach was limited. He trusted they would give him a satisfactory result.

“Father, rest assured.”

Hearing her father’s insistence on their harmony, Nan Gong Yuyan felt a pang of sorrow. She should have been more mature, not clung to her father’s wish to leave the clan to Nan Gong Ping. Weighing the pros and cons, she had no right to blame her father.

“Father, rest well. I’ll work with my brother to restore the Southern Palace to its former glory. You need not worry.”

Nan Gong Yuyan felt she could no longer linger, urging her father to rest. Now she had business to discuss with Nan Gong Ping.

She consoled her father, made promises, then hurriedly left for Nan Gong Ping’s room.

“Sister, you’ve come.”

After their reconciliation, their moods had eased. No longer did they meet with hostility; now they truly regarded each other as family.

Nan Gong Ping sat at his desk, engrossed in reviewing documents. He glanced up upon hearing her voice but quickly returned to his work.

“Our business has been divided significantly, but fortunately, some old clients still support us due to our long-standing cooperation. If we deliver these two orders on time, we can maintain stability for a while.”

Nan Gong Ping reviewed the documents as he spoke, analyzing their current situation without succumbing to anger.

Compared to his previous impatience and being used as a shield, he had now become more composed.

Though he still had much to learn, Nan Gong Yuyan saw a resemblance of her father in him.

She knew some people must pay heavy prices to grow. If given a choice, she doubted Nan Gong Ping would have chosen this path.

“Brother, Father’s health is deteriorating…”

Nan Gong Yuyan felt a rare sense of reliance on Nan Gong Ping. She realized if her father truly passed, he would become her support.

This was the first time she had shown weakness before him. Previously, she either spoke sharply or internalized her feelings, never sharing them with this brother.

“Don’t worry, Father will be fine. Even if he passes, I’ll protect you and the Southern Palace.”

Nan Gong Ping now spoke gently. When he made this promise, he truly displayed a man’s demeanor and sense of family responsibility.

They had spent too long in rivalry, but now they could speak calmly and feel the warmth of family.

Regretfully, those lost years would never return. No matter how they regretted it, they could only grasp the present.

“I’ve also lost one of my business deals.”

Nan Gong Yuyan quickly suppressed her weakness, returning to calmness. She reported work matters to Nan Gong Ping without the earlier despair and fragility.

She spoke while expressing her concerns:

“Brother, I believe this person is targeting the Southern Palace. The entire inland port seems to be his pawns. He merely aims to restrict us.”

Nan Gong Yuyan slowly analyzed, pausing halfway through her speech before continuing: “What if we establish a small clan unknown to anyone? Would he also divide our information among those small factions?”

This was a plan Nan Gong Yuyan had pondered for long. She thought, if he loved stealing their business and distributing it to small factions, they could create an unrelated identity. If he truly supported them, perhaps they could uncover some clues.

“Hmm, your plan is quite good.”

Nan Gong Ping had been overwhelmed with work, feeling like he was split into multiple people. He hadn’t slept a full night in days, constantly traveling and worrying about affairs. Thus, he had no time to devise such strategies.

Hearing Nan Gong Yuyan’s words, he gave her a approving look: “Sister, your mind is quick.”

His expression was entirely sincere. This compliment came from the heart.

He had now accepted the reality that his talent was not as sharp as Nan Gong Yuyan’s. Since he couldn’t change this, he would strive to surpass her in other aspects.

Moreover, Nan Gong Ping no longer felt jealousy toward Nan Gong Yuyan or saw her as a challenge to his masculinity. He was genuinely happy for her.

He had understood their father’s meaning: only by supporting each other could the Southern Palace find its true path.

Thus, Nan Gong Ping had undergone a significant change—no longer hasty or envious.

Chapter 886: Arrival

“We should prepare quickly; perhaps we can soon uncover his clues.”

They say one must treat the root cause. If they didn’t know what illness they faced, how could they find the right medicine?

Thus, being targeted without knowing who their enemy was and avoiding his methods had cost them so much.

“If we could uncover this person’s identity, we might find a way to counter him and administer the right treatment.”

Nan Gong Yuyan nodded, her expression now more certain.

She elaborated to Nan Gong Ping, aiming to clarify the situation thoroughly.

Only by resolving this issue swiftly could they let Nan Gong Lin rest easier and elevate the Southern Palace again. They couldn’t allow other small factions to trample them anymore.

But just as they had plotted their strategy, the door was suddenly knocked on by someone in a hurry. The sound suggested something major had happened.

“What’s the matter? Why so flustered?”

The Southern Palace’s strict rules and disciplined management were well-known. But with so many recent events, the staff had become like birds startled by arrows—no longer calm or composed.

Nan Gong Yuyan was annoyed at the interruption, her tone carrying a hint of displeasure.

She frowned and opened the door, seeing someone rush in immediately.

“Master and Miss, it’s bad news! A strange man has arrived at the gate.”

The security guard quickly informed Nan Gong Yuyan, his face full of worry as if frightened.

“A strange man?”

Nan Gong Yuyan knew these guards at the gate, and hearing them so flustered about a strange man made her frown further. Her mood worsened: “What kind of strange man? Explain clearly.”

After saying this, she coldly stared at the guard, urging him to calm down.

Nan Gong Ping also closed his documents and stood up, approaching Nan Gong Yuyan.

“Quickly explain what’s happening!”

Nan Gong Ping frowned, demanding the guard to speak quickly. He wanted to know who dared to intrude on their Southern Palace.

Though their status had declined significantly compared to the past, they were still one of the top families in the inland port. People usually resorted to underhanded tactics behind the scenes, but openly acting was rare.

Nan Gong Ping truly wanted to know who this person was and what they dared to do to them.

“Master, Miss, I can’t explain clearly. Please come with me quickly; only you can settle this matter.”

The security guard, flustered and speechless, could not describe the situation clearly. “Please come quickly!”

He hurriedly urged Nan Gong Yuyan and Nan Gong Ping, his demeanor more frantic than a ant on hot pavement.

Nan Gong Yuyan and Nan Gong Ping exchanged glances, both seeing worry in each other’s eyes.

Had something truly happened?

But they were the masters of the Southern Palace; if they didn’t go out to handle it, people outside would surely cause chaos. After thinking through, they nodded and went out together.

“By the way, don’t tell Father about this.”

As they left, Nan Gong Yuyan added a叮嘱. Nan Gong Lin had just fallen asleep; she didn’t want this chaos to disturb his rest.

They could handle it themselves, no need for him to miss sleep.

“Yes.”

The security guard, eager for them to leave and manage the situation, would never inform Nan Gong Lin.

Hearing their instructions, he nodded immediately without any further action.

Nan Gong Yuyan and Nan Gong Ping exchanged a glance, suppressing their doubts and worries for now. They hurried to the door.

They saw a young man standing outside, his features exquisitely refined as if sculpted by an expert.

His physique was equally harmonious, and his aura was naturally cultivated. Not only in the inland port, but Nan Gong Yuyan believed she had never met such a remarkable individual elsewhere.

Nan Gong Ping’s thoughts were similar; he was also captivated by the man’s aura, his gaze filled with admiration.

“Who are you? What business do you have with the Southern Palace?”

Though this question was interrogative, it remained remarkably calm.

Nan Gong Ping and Nan Gong Yuyan spoke while scrutinizing Su Nantian, as if examining him from head to toe.

They had now realized they needed such talent, but why did his figure feel familiar?

Yet when they looked at his face, they were certain—such an outstanding person, if they had met before, they would never forget.

Who was this man? This question deepened their confusion.

“Don’t you know who I am?”

The man at the door was Su Nantian. He had learned from Xu Family that he once served as a bodyguard in the Southern Palace, hence returning to inquire.

But why did these people seem completely unfamiliar with him? Their eyes held no recognition at all.

Su Nantian suddenly recalled the time he fell into the river and was rescued by Uncle Wang. At that moment, his face had worn a human skin mask.

Had he hidden his identity before? That was why they didn’t recognize him now.

This thought made Su Nantian’s suspicions stir.

“Do you know Su Nantian?”

This time, he did not openly admit his identity as he had with the Xu Family. Instead, he probed subtly to see what image Su Nantian held in their minds.

After speaking, he watched Nan Gong Yuyan and Nan Gong Ping.

Chapter 887: Encounter

“Su Nantian?”

Upon hearing this, Nan Gong Yuyan and Nan Gong Ping’s expressions froze. They both exclaimed in unison before frowning at Su Nantian.

“Knowing him is one thing; not knowing him is another.”

Nan Gong Yuyan, more impulsive than Nan Gong Ping, frowned immediately upon hearing Su Nantian’s words. She scrutinized him and coldly said: “Moreover, who are you? Why have you suddenly come to our Southern Palace and asked such strange questions?”

At this point, her gaze at Su Nantian was even more discontented. This man seemed to have appeared from nowhere, yet he mentioned someone they despised.

After hearing his sister’s words, Nan Gong Ping also regained composure. He frowned and stared at Su Nantian: “Indeed! Who are you? What business do you have in our home? Are you here to cause trouble?”

After saying this, Nan Gong Ping watched him vigilantly, ready to attack at the slightest movement. He would not let Su Nantian escape unchecked.

Upon hearing these two words, Su Nantian’s expression was stunned and puzzled. He felt as if he hadn’t spoken yet, only asked whether they recognized him—but their reactions were so intense, as if he had committed unforgivable sins.

This thought made Su Nantian’s expression strange, deepening his curiosity about his life before the amnesia.

Who was he that they despised and feared so much?

“I didn’t come to cause you trouble. I’m here to find Su Nantian.”

After thinking, Su Nantian changed his approach.

He knew their attitude suggested deep resentment toward the original version of himself. Thus, he decided to change his strategy and probe for information from the opposite angle.

“I heard he once worked as a bodyguard in the Southern Palace, so I’ve come to find him.”

Su Nantian said this and watched Nan Gong Yuyan and Nan Gong Ping, waiting for their answer.

“Haha, you’ve come too late.”

Upon hearing Su Nantian’s question, Nan Gong Yuyan’s expression turned grim. She coldly smiled and answered: “You’ve come too late.”

“What do you mean by that?”

Su Nantian frowned, asking Nan Gong Yuyan. He felt the truth was about to emerge and that clues would soon be found from their mouths.

“Because Su Nantian is dead. A traitor like him, dying was no loss!”

Nan Gong Yuyan spoke coldly and disrespectfully toward Su Nantian, clearly showing her disdain.

This also confirmed that the previous Su Nantian had done unforgivable deeds to provoke such strong reactions.

“Dead? How did he die?”

Upon hearing their words, Su Nantian was stunned. He hadn’t known they considered him dead.

But soon, he recalled when Uncle Wang had rescued him from the river. At that time, they said if they hadn’t saved him immediately, he might have faced danger.

In other words, without Uncle Wang’s help, Su Nantian might have perished in the river.

In a general sense, Nan Gong Yuyan’s statement wasn’t entirely wrong.

But after hearing this, Su Nantian realized his questions were beginning to show signs of progress.

If they all knew he was dead, that meant they understood how he had met his fate.

“Can you explain in detail? How did he die, and what do you mean by ‘he betrayed his master’? Isn’t he a bodyguard in your clan?”

Su Nantian asked each of his questions one by one, patiently waiting for Nan Gong Yuyan and her brother’s answers.

“Haha, a bodyguard? Our Southern Palace couldn’t afford such an arrogant one. We were foolish to be deceived by him, thinking he was loyal—only to find out he had used us to approach the Wu Family.”

At this point, Nan Gong Yuyan paused and looked at Su Nantian with irritation: “By the way, who are you? You haven’t said yet. Why should I tell you about Su Nantian?”

At this point, Nan Gong Yuyan looked at Su Nantian with disdain: “Leave. We don’t know this person and don’t want to learn about him!”

“Indeed! Leave.”

Nan Gong Ping echoed his sister’s words: “After meeting him, we’ve had no good fortune. Now we have a pile of troubles to deal with—don’t add more trouble here. After all, this person is dead; you’ve come to the wrong place.”

Although they had analyzed and concluded that the current Southern Palace’s issues were not Su Nantian’s doing, thinking of how he had exploited their trust to approach the Wu Family step by step—and after killing Wu Chuan, causing them such trouble—Nan Gong Yuyan and Nan Gong Ping could no longer treat Su Nantian with a normal mindset.

Thus, upon hearing about Su Nantian, they decided not to waste words and began to drive him away.

Su Nantian was no fool; he could sense their disdain and hatred in his tone. Yet, he still didn’t understand what he had done to provoke their annoyance.

He recalled Nan Gong Yuyan’s angry words: that he had used the Southern Palace to ascend and approach the Wu Family.

Thus, this Wu Family must be Wu Chuan mentioned by the Xu Family. This connected everything.

But why had he hidden his identity in the Southern Palace and approached the Wu Family? This remained an enigma.

“This matter is very important to me. I hope you can tell me.”

Su Nantian could not let them leave so easily; he continued to insist, determined to get an answer.

At this point, his expression was utterly serious.

Chapter 888: Nan Gong Siblings

“Ah, you must be crazy. Didn’t you hear us? We said we don’t have the mood to answer your questions and don’t want to hear anything about Su Nantian. If you’re smart, leave now.”

Nan Gong Yuyan furrowed her brows, displeased by Su Nantian.

Especially seeing he hadn’t understood their words and kept asking these questions, she felt her mood worsened.

“You’d better leave now; otherwise, when I get angry, I won’t speak so gently to you.”

At that time, Nan Gong Yuyan would certainly use methods to have the family’s security drive Su Nantian out.

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian saw Nan Gong Yuyan’s determined expression and knew she would do as she said.

But Su Nantian still didn’t leave as they wished; instead, he took a step forward: “Two of you, I have no ill intent. I came here only to ask about Su Nantian. This matter is very important to me, so I hope you tell me everything you know.”

After saying this, Su Nantian looked seriously at Nan Gong Yuyan and Nan Gong Ping, his eyes concealing a hint of threat.

“What do you mean? Do you think we Southern Palace can’t handle you?”

Nan Gong Yuyan frowned, her expression worsening. When had their Southern Palace allowed anyone to come in and challenge them?

Had they truly declined so much that people no longer feared their Southern Palace?

Just thinking about this, Nan Gong Yuyan felt furious. The days of their glory in the inland port seemed to have vanished forever.

And these people dared to trample on them!

Nan Gong Ping seemed to have similar thoughts, so his expression also turned grim.

“You’re overstepping! I advise you to be wise and leave, or else when things get ugly, there’ll be no chance for regret.”

Nan Gong Ping was still relatively gentle; since the person hadn’t done anything yet, only intruding to ask about Su Nantian, they wouldn’t be fair if they directly drove him out.

But now that Su Nantian had repeatedly defied them and ignored their words, Nan Gong Ping was also angry.

“Please leave this place; we don’t know the person you’re talking about and won’t answer any more questions.”

Nan Gong Ping took a step forward, standing in front of Nan Gong Yuyan to protect her, then spoke with absolute authority to Su Nantian.

The implication was clear: leave and stop troubling them.

Su Nantian hadn’t obtained the information he wanted, so how could he leave so easily?

Thus, the atmosphere began to tense. Neither side could persuade the other nor threaten them.

“Never mind, brother, this person is impossible to reason with. Have the security drive him out.”

Nan Gong Yuyan was now exhausted, looking at Su Nantian with disdain before giving orders. She had no patience for this person anymore, especially after the recent troubles of the Southern Palace.

This man’s vague words and questions she didn’t want to answer had made her even more impatient.

“Hmm.”

Nan Gong Ping also nodded in agreement, then made a gesture for the security to approach and drive Su Nantian out.

They also didn’t want to see this person anymore or anyone related to Su Nantian.

The security naturally obeyed their masters’ orders. Seeing Nan Gong Ping and Nan Gong Yuyan both command them to drive Su Nantian out, they immediately approached and took weapons to expel him.

“Go, go, come with us out.”

Their tone could be described as somewhat harsh, but it wasn’t surprising. After all, Su Nantian had become a nuisance here and made their masters unhappy. These security personnel naturally wouldn’t let him stay any longer.

But just then, Su Nantian suddenly snatched the weapons from the security guards with a speed they hadn’t anticipated.
