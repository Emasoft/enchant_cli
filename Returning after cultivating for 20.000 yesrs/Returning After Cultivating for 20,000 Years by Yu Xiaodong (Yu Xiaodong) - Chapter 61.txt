When they arrived, the two of them had crammed onto a train; on their return, they finally switched to a more upscale mode of transportation. It was better to be in charge outside—being able to mobilize various resources without feeling constrained.

An hour later, the helicopter smoothly landed at the Dragon Group's private helipad. Before returning, Tang Sanfeng had already contacted Du Changwei, and Old Du had been waiting outside the airport for quite some time.

"Ah! You two heroes have returned victorious—truly exhausting!"

Seeing Su Nantian and Tang Sanfeng disembark from the helicopter, Du Changwei hurried forward. Of course, Zhang An was also there, running more enthusiastically than Old Du.

There was no choice but for him to try to curry favor with Su Nantian. If he could please Su Nantian, his pair of boxing gloves would be secured. There was no way he could afford to be disobedient.

"No trouble at all, no trouble at all. It's for the people's service!"

Tang Sanfeng forced a smile, handing his briefcase to Du Changwei. Old Du took it and passed it on to Zhang An. Neither of them regarded this so-called "Blood Clan Sacred Relic" as anything special.

After all, the Dragon Group's storage room was overflowing with strange and bizarre items to an unbearable extent. They had long since become desensitized; if not for the fear of it falling into the wrong hands and causing unnecessary trouble, Old Du would have already cleaned out the storage room.

As they walked and chatted, they returned to Du Changwei's office. Zhang An took the briefcase to register it in storage, leaving only the three of them in the office.

Tang Sanfeng recounted the details of this mission, including his subsequent speculations. Old Du's brows furrowed—unbelievable that the Tongtusi family had dared to send a duke and marquis. Fortunately, Su Nantian had wiped them out entirely; otherwise, it would have caused a massive upheaval.

Yet thinking of Su Nantian's explosive power, Old Du couldn't help but feel delighted. He smiled broadly: "Little Su, you've done an excellent job on this mission. And you've suffered such a severe injury—our organization must provide appropriate compensation and rewards. Tell me, what do you want?"

Chapter 292: New Mission

Su Nantian had previously been taken advantage of by Old Du, knowing this old fox's cheap tricks weren't so easy to take. He asked casually: "Can I have anything?"

"Anything we have inside is fine."

After saying this, Old Du realized it was slightly off and quickly added: "Of course, within reasonable limits. Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to account for it upwards or downwards."

"Cheh, old trickster!"

Su Nantian scowled, muttering in his heart. After a few seconds of thinking, he finally spoke: "You can rest easy—my greed isn't that extreme. Just like before, let me pick two items I find appealing from the storage room. That's not too much, right?"

"Not at all, it's not excessive."

After realizing Su Nantian's value, Old Du naturally wouldn't be stingy with the strange items in the storage room. He waved his hand generously and decided: "I think this way—since you've made a great contribution, and you're also severely injured, your contribution can be counted as selecting four items from the storage room."

It must be said that to win Su Nantian over, Old Du had truly invested heavily. Of course, if Su Nantian hadn't shown his worth, this old fox wouldn't have done it.

After all, even within the Dragon Group, those who could unleash such destructive power were few and far between—each one was an elder hidden away. Unless it was a life-or-death situation, they wouldn't appear.

But Su Nantian was different. He was young, around twenty years old, with strong potential. Given another ten or twenty years, who knew how far he could grow? Spending a few strange little items to please such a future world-class powerhouse was definitely a sure bet.

Moreover, Su Nantian himself was skilled in forging and medicine—undoubtedly. Old Du calculated it over and over, thinking he had gained a lot. Perhaps the entire Dragon Group would rely on him to uphold its reputation.

Old Du's subtle intentions naturally weren't hidden from Su Nantian, but it was a good thing. He wouldn't expose it. The two of them exchanged a smile, and everything was understood without words.

After completing this mission smoothly, Tang Sanfeng took a few days off to return to the Tang Sect and restock his equipment.

Old Du readily agreed, telling him to rest well. Then he had Zhang An accompany Su Nantian to the secret storage room to select items.

Previously, Su Nantian had wanted to find a few more metal materials to upgrade his Divine Evil Sword. After all, the current state of the Divine Evil Sword wasn't very good.

The accumulated evil energy was too heavy, and the sword's material couldn't keep up. It risked breaking at any moment. Unfortunately, he had wandered around Han City but hadn't found anything valuable.

Now, with Old Du's blessing, he confidently selected four different-sized metal ores from the Dragon Group's storage room—excellent materials for forging the Divine Evil Sword.

After finishing everything, he also wanted to ask Old Du for a few days off to visit Lin Suyun and the other girls in Fengcheng.

Additionally, his current identity was still a student at Fengcheng University. Since he had decided to stay and serve in the Dragon Group, he needed to handle things with the school. He also had to brief his subordinates so they wouldn't be lost.

As he thought about it, Su Nantian slowly walked to the door of Old Du's office. He was about to knock when Old Du pulled the door open from inside, seeing him standing there. His face lit up and he pulled him in.

"Ah! Little Su, you came at the perfect time. How did you know I was coming to find you?"

Hearing this, Su Nantian had a question mark on his head. His purpose in coming here was to ask for leave, not to have a telepathic connection with this old fox. It would be bad if people misunderstood, spreading rumors.

Thinking of that, he quickly explained: "Section Chief, I came to..."

"Alright, don't speak yet. Look at this."

Before he could explain his purpose, Old Du interrupted directly and handed him a file folder, indicating to read it first.

"Alright."

Su Nantian reluctantly took the file folder and opened it. Inside were several papers and a stack of photos. He examined them carefully—apparently, two people's detailed files.

"Uh, Yue Han and Yue Xiaoshan. Are they father and daughter? These names sound so familiar?"

He muttered softly, realizing who these two were after reading. Simply put, they were wealthy people—rich enough to rival a nation.

The Yue family was a century-old family business in Jiangcheng. In the early years, they had made their fortune through real estate. After Yue Han took over, he turned his attention to the most advanced technology industry, spending twenty years establishing Xin Yue Technology Group. It was a top-tier leader in the tech field both domestically and internationally.

As Yue Han grew older and his health deteriorated, he gradually handed over the power of Xin Yue Technology to his only daughter, Yue Xiaoshan.

This father and daughter were the chairman and general manager of the group respectively. They tightly controlled all the company's life-and-death powers, having immense influence in the business world—even provincial and municipal leaders had to respect them.

"Rich, powerful, fair-skinned, beautiful, with long legs..."

Su Nantian focused on Yue Xiaoshan's photo and gave a casual evaluation. He looked at Old Du with suspicion: "Section Chief, why are you showing me their files?"

"Ahem... well, Little Su, it's like this."

Old Du coughed twice and explained awkwardly: "Xin Yue Technology Group has always been one of our department's closest partners. Now, something strange is happening there—someone seems to want harm Yue Han and his daughter. For both sentiment and reason, we can't stand by idly. Therefore..."

"Section Chief, let me interrupt."

Before Old Du could finish his sentence, Su Nantian interjected: "I think I get your meaning. Are you saying that the Yue family lacks bodyguards and wants me to temporarily play one?"

Old Du smiled and nodded: "Heh, you're smart. You can understand it that way."

As soon as Old Du finished speaking, Su Nantian immediately groaned: "My god, Section Chief, are you even human? I just came back from Han City and haven't even sat on a chair long enough to get comfortable. You're sending me out again? It's no different from a landlord exploiting the poor."

To be honest, this so-called temporary bodyguard mission was really something he didn't want to do. It had no challenge and no profit—truly a thankless task. A fool would accept such a mission.

"Little Su, some details you might not understand. Let me explain slowly."

Old Du, this old trickster, was patient and persistent: "Just being a few days of bodyguard work, there are many people in our department who can fight and endure. Naturally, we don't need you to act. But now Yue Han is bedridden, and Xin Yue Group's power hasn't fully transferred to Yue Xiaoshan. This transition period is very important."

"A big cake like this will always have people wanting to take advantage of the chaos and gain some benefits. A tiger can't withstand many hungry wolves. We're worried Yue Xiaoshan might not withstand the pressures from all sides. If that happens, the entire group would collapse."

Chapter 293: Bargaining

After Old Du spoke for more than ten minutes, the summary was two points. Xin Yue Group was one of the Dragon Group's partners and absolutely couldn't collapse. And Su Nantian was around Yue Xiaoshan's age, so communication and understanding were easy.

More precious still, Su Nantian's medical skills were very good. At the right time, he might even save Yue Han's life—at least ensure Xin Yue Group smoothly passed through the transition period.

So Old Du and his team had discussed it briefly and decided to send Su Nantian on this mission, provided he was willing.

In the office, both men remained silent for nearly half a minute. Seeing Su Nantian showed no intention of accepting the mission, Old Du offered an incentive: "Little Su, I know you had a hard time in Han City and still have injuries. But Xin Yue Group is crucial, absolutely cannot fail. If you're willing to go, I can let you pick one more item from the storage room. How about that?"

"Huh?"

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian immediately perked up. He was very envious of the items in the Dragon Group's secret storage room, but he couldn't openly steal them.

Now Old Du was using this as a bargaining chip to exchange with him, effectively giving him the opportunity to strike. This chance was once in a lifetime; missing it would make him regret for years.

Thinking of this, Su Nantian didn't want to argue with Old Du anymore. He raised his right hand and extended three fingers, saying lightly: "Three items and I'll go."

"You!"

Old Du's fat face crinkled, almost twisting his nose. He had managed the Dragon Group's power for so long and this was the first time someone negotiated with him while taking a mission. He was momentarily at a loss for words.

Angry as he was, he knew this task had to be done by Su Nantian. Otherwise, no one else would do. He gritted his teeth and said: "Two items—take it or leave it!"

"Three items."

Su Nantian remained unmoved, confidently rebutting: "Old Du, you're the Deputy Head of the Dragon Group. You shouldn't be so stingy. Those items are useless to you anyway. It's better to give them to me, at least I can turn them into strength. My enhanced strength will allow me to serve the people better, right?"

Old Du was speechless from Su Nantian's words. Finally, he muttered a few words: "You're taking advantage of the situation!"

Su Nantian didn't hold back: "You're forcing me to do it. I'm injured and still being sent out as a bodyguard. Do you even know how to be a leader?"

"Alright, let's end this here. Three items—three it is. But you must leave immediately; Yue Han can't wait."

Old Du realized he was at a disadvantage and agreed to Su Nantian's conditions, urging him to depart quickly for Jiangcheng.

"No problem. But you need to assign me a partner. You can't expect me to go alone, right?"

Su Nantian had been with Tang Sanfeng for many days and knew quite a bit about the Dragon Group's rules.

Normally, team members on external missions were paired in twos. On one hand, they could support each other and discuss matters together; on the other hand, there was a supervision aspect to prevent anyone from taking advantage of their position and doing evil under the organization's name.

Su Nantian had just arrived, no fixed partner. His previous partner Tang Sanfeng had already taken leave to return to the Tang Sect in Sichuan. Therefore, he needed Old Du to assign him a partner.

"Right right, you didn't mention it, I almost forgot."

Old Du nodded in agreement. After thinking for a few seconds, he suggested: "What do you think of Zhang An? He's strong and obedient. He's very suitable as a bodyguard. I'll have him obey your orders."

Su Nantian shook his head and refused directly: "Zhang An is very good, but he's not much help for this mission. I want someone with more professional skills."

"Professional skills?"

Old Du furrowed his brows: "What do you mean by that?"

"What else could it be?"

Su Nantian rolled his eyes and explained: "The Xin Yue Group is a tech company. I'm not very familiar with those things. I need someone who understands computers and can handle high-tech products. If that person is also a top-level hacker, it would be even better."

"Ah, that makes sense."

Old Du thought for a moment and agreed. For tasks requiring mental effort, it was more complicated than fighting. It did need a professional.

As the most mysterious violent department in China, the Dragon Group never lacked various experts. Old Du took out his phone and carefully searched through it before finally locking onto one person, making a decision: "Alright, that's him. Little Su, let's go find him."

"Find him? Can't you just call him over?"

Su Nantian was very confused. As the Deputy Head of the Dragon Group, Old Du actually had to go in person to find someone. That was rare. Did this person really have such power?

"Oh, that's not possible."

Old Du stood up and waved his hand: "He usually works in a very special place. The electronic signals there are too strong, making it impossible to call in. He also doesn't like using old-style landline phones. To find him, we have to go in person."

"Okay, let's go."

Since Old Du described this person so mysteriously, Su Nantian became very curious. He followed Old Du out of the office and took two elevators, finally stopping at the second basement level.

Looking at the two metal doors in front of him, Su Nantian asked: "Does he usually work here?"

"Exactly."

Old Du nodded and pressed his palm against the electronic screen on the door. Then he put his head in to verify his iris, and after confirming his identity, the two doors slowly opened to the sides.

He continued walking inside and explained softly to Su Nantian: "This is our Dragon Group's data archive. In this information age, all files are electronically archived here. The person we're looking for is Chu Yan, one of the archive managers here."

"I see."

Su Nantian nodded slightly in understanding. At the same time, he couldn't help but use his spiritual sense to scan around. His conclusion shocked him.

Although the two metal doors behind him looked unremarkable, his spiritual sense couldn't penetrate them. He couldn't identify what material they were made of—probably at least the level of meteorite metal.

In the passage they were walking through, there were hidden cold mechanisms and hot weapons everywhere. Many places even had impossibly strange arrays that could harm people. It was no wonder the defense of even a third-rate sect would be weaker than this.

But it made sense. The Dragon Group had only been established for a few decades, but they had handled countless events both domestically and internationally. Some event details couldn't be publicly disclosed; once spread, it would cause unnecessary panic. Therefore, keeping their archives tightly secured was understandable.

Old Du didn't notice Su Nantian's small actions. As they walked, he explained: "This Chu Yan should be a few years older than you. He's a computer technology genius. Two years ago, while he was in university, he got addicted to gaming and hacked into the game company's server using his own programming skills. He obtained a lot of equipment and gold coins, and the most important thing was that the game company didn't even notice."

Chapter 294: Big Brother? Little Brother!

At this point, Old Du smiled proudly: "Later on, this kid became bolder and even secretly hacked into the local inspection bureau's internal network. I found out about it during a routine check and traced it back to him. Eventually, this kid reformed and became part of the organization. He usually handles archive management and hardware/software maintenance for all offices."

After hearing Old Du's introduction, Su Nantian was very satisfied: "Wow, it seems Chu Yan is truly a talent. He's perfect for this mission."

This person was very capable and young. From the fact that he had hacked into the inspection bureau's internal network, it was clear he wasn't timid. If they worked well together, this trip to Jiangcheng would be much easier.

"I think the same. That's why I thought of him immediately."

Under Old Du's guidance, Su Nantian walked through several corridors and arrived at the largest office.

Inside were hundreds of display screens of various sizes, with various instruments constantly blinking. It looked like an alien spaceship.

The office was very empty except for those high-tech products, leaving only a luxurious massage chair and someone lying on it playing with their phone. That person should be the one they were looking for—Chu Yan.

"Cough."

Old Du coughed a few times to remind himself of his presence. He stepped in and said earnestly: "Chu Yan, why do you always like to lie there playing with your phone? It's bad for your health. If you have time, go to the nearby gym and exercise."

"Hey, Old Du, you're here."

Chu Yan was familiar with Old Du's voice. He didn't even lift his head and replied casually: "Why go there? My body is fine. Lying on a luxurious massage chair equals having a high-level masseuse constantly massaging me. No need to waste time on the gym."

"Uh."

This reason made Su Nantian speechless. But everyone has their own way of living. If this person felt that lying down was good for his health, what could he say?

Old Du forced a smile and advised: "I think you've been stuck here for too long. How about I assign an external mission to you so you can move around and relax?"

"No."

As soon as Old Du finished speaking, Chu Yan immediately refused: "I don't even want to go to the nearby gym. Do you think I'd like to run elsewhere? Just tell me directly, don't disturb my game. I'm about to finish it."

"Alright, I'll just say it directly."

For someone who believed in stillness, Old Du had no idea what to do. He just repeated the same thing he had told Su Nantian earlier.

He hoped Chu Yan would move his precious legs for the organization and people, going to Jiangcheng to complete the mission.

"Ha. No."

Chu Yan said those two words again, lazily sitting up: "Why do you have to send me? There are so many computer experts in our department. Why must it be me? And I've never done an external mission before. You don't worry about me making a mess and you having to take the blame?"

"Hey, Chu Yan, everything has its first time. I believe in your character and ability."

Old Du quickly smiled: "Besides, this person you're paired with is two years younger than you. He just completed his first external mission and did it very well. I think the two of you together would be a perfect match."

"Is that him?"

Chu Yan was smart. Old Du had brought an unfamiliar stranger here, and with what Old Du just said, he immediately guessed Su Nantian's identity—exactly the partner Old Du had assigned him.

"Yes, I'm Su Nantian. Hello."

Su Nantian politely greeted him. Chu Yan looked at him for a few seconds and nodded slightly in approval: "Good, he's good-looking. Since Old Du assigned us to work together, I'll be your big brother from now on. You'll definitely benefit from following me."

Su Nantian smiled and said casually: "Actually, I need to correct you. It's not that you're my big brother, but I'm the one who will be the leader. Everything must follow me."

Chu Yan was a top expert in information technology, so he naturally had pride. Unless someone could beat him in his area of expertise, he wouldn't respect anyone.

This was evident from how he addressed Old Du. In the entire Dragon Group, few people dared to call Old Du directly by name.

Hearing Su Nantian's words, he stood up from the massage chair and raised his head to angrily ask: "You're a rookie who just arrived. What gives you the right to say that?"

"Just because of this, okay?"

Su Nantian didn't want to explain much. He slowly raised his right hand and released a sword qi twenty centimeters long, continuously breathing in and out with a roaring sound. It looked very terrifying.

Seeing this, Chu Yan immediately submitted: "Okay, okay, I give up. From now on, you're the leader and I'm your little brother. Everything will follow your orders."

This kid had been an administrator in the Dragon Group's archive for so long. He had read many strange and bizarre files in his spare time, naturally recognizing what Su Nantian's move was. That was the legendary "Sword Qi Emanation," and its length had reached over twenty centimeters. If he had a sharp weapon in hand, it would be unstoppable—killing gods and Buddhas alike. Being a subordinate to such a big brother was neither embarrassing nor degrading.

Old Du took the opportunity to finalize the mission: "So you two are going to Jiangcheng, and that's it?"

"No problem."

Chu Yan patted his chest and guaranteed he had no objections. Then he also asked for a few of the latest high-tech products.

When going out, they needed many things. Old Du waved his hand generously and agreed, also approving two thousand yuan for meals and transportation.

"Alright. Now you two chat a bit, get to know each other, and then leave for Jiangcheng as soon as possible. I'll go talk to Yue Han and his daughter. Remember, this mission is quite secret. Only they know your identities. Don't let it slip."

After finishing the necessary instructions, Old Du left Su Nantian behind. He put his hands behind his back and hummed a tune, walking out of the archive room.

Watching Old Du leave, Chu Yan couldn't help but complain: "Cheh, really stingy. Two thousand yuan is enough for what? Not even a mainstream graphics card."

"Alright, you should be grateful. At least there's two thousand yuan."

Su Nantian felt the same about Old Du's stinginess: "Previously, when I and Old Tang went to Han City on a mission, he only gave us each a train ticket—hard seats. We paid extra to upgrade to sleeper cars, and he still hasn't said anything about reimbursement."

Chapter 295: Arrival in Jiangcheng

"Uh, that's true. This is definitely something Old Du would do."

Old Du's personality was well-known to Chu Yan, who nodded in agreement. This kid had also suffered many losses from Old Du.

After that, they talked for a while. Su Nantian was very curious about Chu Yan's various computer skills and asked some questions, gaining a lot of insight.

Chu Yan was envious of Su Nantian's powerful combat skills, calling him "big brother" constantly. It sounded very sweet, and the two of them quickly became friends without any awkwardness.

Thus, they got along well for over an hour. The high-tech equipment Old Du had promised Chu Yan was gradually delivered, and after checking it carefully, Chu Yan packed it up to take with him.

Taking this opportunity, he called Lin Suyun and the others to inform them of his current situation. The girls all understood and reminded him to be careful while on the mission, not to get injured again.

According to the distance, their destination Jiangcheng was hundreds of kilometers away from Jingdu. Su Nantian had planned to fly there, as he wasn't short of money and didn't rely on the two thousand yuan Old Du gave. Why委屈 himself?

But his suggestion was directly rejected by Chu Yan, the reason being that he didn't trust the newly acquired equipment. If they took a plane, those items would have to be checked in, and there was a risk of damage during the journey.

Chu Yan valued those items more than his life, so he naturally didn't want to take such a risk. There was no choice but for Su Nantian to comply with his idea, and they took turns driving to Jiangcheng, which took most of the day.

After arriving in Jiangcheng, they directly drove their car to the building where Xin Yue Technology Group was located. They planned to scout first before meeting with Yue Han and his daughter.

Chu Yan, truly a professional, took out a small strange device and walked around the building for half a circle before nodding in satisfaction.

Then he pointed to the position opposite and confidently said: "Big brother, we can choose this direction as our base. The fiber optic cables in this building all come from there. I can just make a few adjustments and control most of the electronic office equipment around here. All data from Xin Yue Group will escape my monitoring."

"Excellent!"

Hearing this, Su Nantian raised his thumb and gave a thumbs-up without hesitation. He felt relieved that his choice was correct. Having such a hacker expert assisting him would save so much trouble.

Then Su Nantian looked around and noticed a luxurious hotel nearby with an introduction posted outside. It was a four-star hotel, well-known both inside and outside Jiangcheng.

So he took the initiative to arrange: "Chu Yan, since our mission must be secret, let's just stay nearby. I think this hotel is very good. Let's go check it out."

"Big brother, no need to be so complicated. Just look at your phone."

Chu Yan waved his hand and took out his phone, finding the hotel's information on it. After carefully looking at it, he seemed hesitant: "This Kailie Hotel is four stars, but some of its hardware facilities are no worse than five-star hotels. And the accommodation price isn't cheap. If we stay there, the two thousand yuan Old Du gave us won't last for several days."

"Cheh, you really take that small amount of money seriously?"

Su Nantian scoffed and laughed: "You see, big brother doesn't lack that small amount of money. If we stay, it must be comfortable. Save the two thousand yuan for snacks."

"Woah, this is the legendary Supreme VIP black card? I've only seen pictures of it online. I didn't expect to see the real thing today. Let me touch it."

As a genius familiar with various high-tech operations, Chu Yan naturally wasn't unfamiliar with such things. He immediately grabbed the black card from Su Nantian's hand and flipped it over to examine it curiously, almost wanting to take it apart to see what was inside.

"Alright, you can look later. Let's go settle in at the hotel first. You quickly assemble those high-tech gadgets in the car, and I'll go meet Yue's father and daughter to get a sense of things."

Su Nantian's plan was simple. Since Old Du had clearly stated that this protection mission must be secret, they couldn't go in openly.

The best approach was to do it secretly and overtly. Chu Yan would stay around Xin Yue Group, monitoring all incoming and outgoing data.

Su Nantian himself would go forward to guard them closely, never leaving their side. This way, he could at least wait for the opportunity without running around like a headless fly.

Su Nantian used his Supreme Black Card to book a luxury presidential suite at the Kailie Hotel. It had three bedrooms, and he and Chu Yan each took one. The third could be used as an office for Chu Yan, both safe and convenient.

After that, Chu Yan stayed in the room to set up those high-tech gadgets. Su Nantian went alone to Xin Yue Group for a brief tour, slightly gathering information. He had already learned the day before that Yue Han was hospitalized due to illness.

"So I have to go to the hospital? But that place is full of people, and it's easy to run into problems. I can't afford to be lazy."

Thinking of this, Su Nantian took out his phone and found the two phone numbers Old Du had given him before leaving—Yue Han's and Yue Xiaoshan's.

Now that Yue Han was hospitalized due to illness, his daughter Yue Xiaoshan was probably also accompanying him. He directly called Yue Xiaoshan, had a brief conversation, and then took a taxi to Jiangcheng People's Hospital to meet with Yue's father and daughter.

Twenty minutes later, the driver accurately parked the car at the front entrance of Jiangcheng People's Hospital. Su Nantian paid and got out, walking briskly into the first-floor waiting hall.

A woman in her early twenties wearing a black business suit was anxiously looking around, surrounded by several people. She was Yue Xiaoshan, the one Su Nantian had arranged to meet.

"Uh, her face is eight out of ten, her figure is eight out of ten, and her attire also gets an eight. This number is auspicious."

Su Nantian had seen Yue Xiaoshan's photo in the files. He immediately recognized her and secretly gave her a score in his heart. Overall, she was a beautiful woman.

Then Su Nantian quickly approached Yue Xiaoshan and politely greeted: "Miss Yue, hello. I'm Su Nantian."

"Oh, you're Mr. Su? Hello, hello!"

Seeing this person was indeed Su Nantian, Yue Xiaoshan's eyes lit up. She had expected the person sent by the Dragon Group to be an older man, but instead it was a young man younger than herself. She immediately nodded and greeted him.

Chapter 296: Poisoned Heart

Su Nantian looked around and noticed that no fewer than ten people were following Yue Xiaoshan. There were bodyguards in black suits, two secretaries in business attire, and even several doctors and nurses in white coats.

His eyes were very sharp. He immediately noticed the name tags on the doctors and nurses' chests—there was a vice president, two department heads. It was clear how important Yue Han was to the hospital; even such high-level managers had to be present constantly.

This scene obviously wasn't suitable for discussing deeper topics. Su Nantian suggested: "Well, Miss Yue, do you think we should..."

Before he could finish his sentence, a high-pitched scream suddenly came from the front desk of the waiting hall: "President Liu, something's wrong with the patient in the special care ward!"

"What?!"

Hearing this, everyone was stunned. At that moment, the entire Jiangcheng People's Hospital's special care ward only housed one person—Yue Han. The front desk nurse said there was a problem in that ward. Did it mean Yue Han had developed another complication?

"Quick, hurry!"

There was no time for further conversation. The closest to the elevator was Yue Xiaoshan, who rushed in first. The vice president and department heads followed immediately. However, Su Nantian was the farthest away and ended up last.

When everyone hurried to the special care ward, doctors were already conducting a comprehensive examination of Yue Han. At that moment, Yue Han's face was very bad—pale and white, with spots of pale on his arms.

Yue Xiaoshan quickly approached the hospital bed and pointed to Su Nantian at the door, saying softly: "Dad, this is Mr. Su."

Yue Han and Old Du were long-time friends. They didn't hide anything from each other. He had heard some of Su Nantian's abilities from Old Du, so he nodded slightly: "Mr. Su, this truly troubles you."

"Ha ha, Mr. Yue, you're too polite. It's for the people's service."

Su Nantian rubbed his nose and slowly walked into the ward. The doctors and nurses who had crowded in front stepped aside to give him space.

"Mr. Yue, your condition is a bit strange."

After entering the ward and seeing Yue Han's appearance, Su Nantian had some suspicions but wasn't sure. "May I check your pulse?"

"Go ahead, do whatever you want." Yue Han was indifferent and leaned back on the bed.

Su Nantian quickly approached the hospital bed, extended three fingers of his right hand and placed them on Yue Han's left wrist. Then he closed his eyes.

"Mr. Yue, you've been poisoned."

After half a minute, Su Nantian finally opened his eyes and gave a clear diagnosis.

Yue Xiaoshan heard Su Nantian's words and felt like she had been struck by lightning. She couldn't believe it, looking at Yue Han.

"Poisoned?" Yue Han was also wide-eyed and confused: "How could I be poisoned?"

"Mr. Yue, there are indeed traces of toxins in your body." Su Nantian nodded again.

"Ah, I had already suspected it." Seeing Su Nantian's determined expression, Yue Han sighed reluctantly.

"Recently, my body has been deteriorating. Even if it's natural aging, I couldn't have aged this fast. At first, I just suspected poisoning, but after various tests in the hospital, nothing was found. Now it seems I really have been poisoned."

Yue Han seemed to be giving a farewell speech, and his aura immediately relaxed. He looked like a withered candle in the wind—there was a sense of hero's decline.

"Dad, don't worry." Yue Xiaoshan's eyes were red from crying and rushed to comfort: "With the doctors here and Mr. Su, they will definitely cure you!"

Yue Xiaoshan knew that Su Nantian came from the mysterious Dragon Group, where there were many strong people. At that moment, Su Nantian was a lifeline for her—she placed all her hopes on him and hoped he could find a way to cure Yue Han.

"Miss Yue, don't worry. I'll do my best." Su Nantian made a serious promise. Yue Xiaoshan's tense feelings eased slightly.

"Woah!"

At this moment, Yue Han suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood. His face showed several strange pale spots, and his eyelids were almost too tired to open.
