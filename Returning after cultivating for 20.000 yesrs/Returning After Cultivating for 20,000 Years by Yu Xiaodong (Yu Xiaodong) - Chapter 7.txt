Xu Tian's heart was filled with fear. Thinking back to the bet, recalling Su Nantian's overconfident demeanor, he realized he had been outwitted. The relationship between Su Nantian and this female pianist was undeniably extraordinary.

This was a deliberate attempt to trap him.

"Master Su, I shall humbly perform. Please offer your guidance."

The female pianist at Huiyun Residence was actually seeking Su Nantian's advice.

No way! Were they acting?

"Please offer your guidance!" This kid could play the zither too!

How could a poor boy know a pianist?

Xu Tian's face was filled with shock as he watched this scene, his mind brimming with questions.

His cigarette fell to the ground.

Did he really have to kneel and call him "father"?

Impossible. If he did that, he would never be able to face anyone again.

At this moment, Xu Tian's eyes were bloodshot as he stared at Su Nantian, wishing to carve him into a thousand pieces and desecrate his corpse a hundred times.

Cao Guangliang's face darkened further, his legs trembling as he sat down on a chair beside him, gazing at Tian with fear and excitement.

Although he would be punished by Tian later, Su Nantian was definitely doomed. He knew well enough that the person who had provoked Tian before had met a terrible end.

If he could use Tian's hand to kill Su Nantian, he could wash away the humiliation from high school.

As he thought this through, excitement gradually replaced his fear. His body no longer trembled but instead watched the scene with interest, as if already seeing Su Nantian groveling at his feet.

Su Nantian saw the expressions of the two men and immediately understood their thoughts, but he didn't care. He had never taken them seriously; in his eyes, they were just two insects.

Soon after the piece ended, the private room fell silent. Only the beautiful sound of the zither still echoed.

"Good. Today's performance of 'Xiaoxiang Flowing Water' showed great progress compared to last time. However, you lack one thingâ€”Qin Soul," Su Nantian said with a smile.

"Qin Soul?"

Wu Lianxing had never heard of this term. She looked at Su Nantian with confusion.

"Today, let's not discuss it. First, have this one apologize to you."

Su Nantian cast a cold gaze at Xu Tian, who was still stunned.

Xu Tian felt an icy chill rush toward him. Instinctively, he raised his hand and said:

"I'm sorry! I was too impolite earlier. Please don't hold it against me."

After saying this, he realized and glared at Su Nantian with hatred.

"Su Nantian, you..."

"What do you mean 'you'? What should I be called?"

Su Nantian coldly replied.

"Su Nantian, we are classmates. It's better not to make things too tense."

Ye Qing still maintained an arrogant attitude.

"What qualifications do you have to speak to me like that?"

Su Nantian's eyes swept over them, and no one dared say a word.

Cao Guangliang wouldn't reveal Xu Tian's backer at this moment. If Su Nantian was scared and backed down from the bet, he wouldn't be able to use Xu Tian as a tool.

So he carefully concealed his excitement beneath the fear in his eyes.

But such petty tricks could not escape Su Nantian's sharp gaze.

"Hmph. I'm afraid you can't bear the consequences."

Xu Tian thought of Chen Yulin waiting for him at the KTV. His confidence returned.

"Oh? Are you planning to kill me after this?" Su Nantian said calmly.

"Smart. But that would be too easy for you."

Xu Tian thought Su Nantian was afraid and was about to continue humiliating him when he heard a sentence. He thought he had misheard.

Chapter 28: First to Submit

"Talkative as an old woman. Are you speaking to your father like that? Get down on your knees now."

Su Nantian hated it when people threatened him. In the cultivation world, such people died very painfully. He had already controlled his temper.

A bone-chilling coldness instantly filled Xu Tian's entire body. He felt as if he were in an icy vault, his skin covered with goosebumps. Even his face was coated with a dense layer of them.

His knees suddenly weakened.

Boom!

He fell to the ground.

Xu Tian lowered his head reluctantly, calling him "father" while cursing him in his heart.

His eyes were filled with unmistakable killing intent. He was afraid.

He had decided not to let Su Nantian live through this night. He would repay every humiliation he had endured.

Watching the dramatic reversal, Zhang Mu felt a storm of emotions. Everything contradicted his perception of this old friend.

The renowned pianist's inquiry.

His domineering posture.

His bold response.

He doubted whether this was still the Su Nantian he knew. He took a big gulp of alcohol, feeling everything was unreal.

Others were also surprised. The timid Su Nantian had transformed into a bold and powerful handsome man.

But watching Xu Tian kneeling on the ground calling him "father," it constantly reminded them that this was real.

Their gaze toward Su Nantian still held no respect, only some schadenfreude and the fear they hadn't noticed.

When Xu Tian finished his head-bowing and stood up again, his face was full of smiles. There was no trace of hatred left.

"Senior Tian, are you... okay..." Cao Guangliang rubbed his eyes, staring wide-eyed.

Senior Tian wasn't stunned? It was completely out of character. Would this knife still be useful? He cautiously asked.

Others were also stunned.

Had he been scared to death?

Was he crazy?

Was this still the Xu Tian from before?

Even Zhang Mu and Lin Suyun almost dropped their jaws.

This face-changing was too fast.

"You have problems, right? Who are you calling Senior Tian? Senior Tian is sitting there. Don't you have eyes? I've taught you so many times, and yet you still don't learn."

Xu Tian pointed at Su Nantian and shouted at Cao Guangliang without mercy.

He decided to play the son for now. Once he reached the KTV and Chen Shao took action, he could take revenge.

After all, a man must know when to yield and when to fight.

Cao Guangliang was confused but his hands moved quickly. The wine glass was already in his hand.

The other subordinates saw the atmosphere was off and immediately took action.

"Senior Tian, I'm sorry for my ignorance. Here, Xu Tian and the brothers apologize to you. Please forgive our mistake and give us a chance to correct ourselves."

"Respect Senior Tian!"

As Xu Tian's words ended, the wine in their cups was all drunk.

Su Nantian calmly watched this. It had somewhat surprised him. There were definitely people behind, and he was quite curious about who they were.

Su Nantian took a sip of the wine glass.

"For so many years, it's rare for everyone to gather. Let's eat freely tonight. Senior Tian has paid for this meal."

Xu Tian smiled happily, looking very happy as if the conflict had never happened.

"Senior Tian, you should order more dishes. We're not full yet."

Xu Tian bent over and whispered.

Su Nantian let out a cold snort. He said, "You watch it carefully. But don't leave anything behind. I hate wasting food."

His eyes flashed with coldness, watching Xu Tian.

Xu Tian showed no signs of panic. He had seen through it. How could he take back what was said? I'll see how much money you have.

He turned to Wu Lianxing, his hatred clearly visible as he said: "Beauty, would you like to sit down and eat something?"

"Hmph. A coward. You're even unworthy."

Wu Lianxing despised such people, who had no backbone. They were suitable for being eunuchs.

After saying goodbye to Su Nantian, she left.

Watching Wu Lianxing's seductive figure leave, Xu Tian smiled lewdly and licked his lips.

She had a fiery temper. I like that.

He called the server, looking at the menu with gleam in his eyes as if he had found evidence of revenge against Su Nantian. He was very pleased.

He probably didn't know the prices here, thinking it was a small restaurant on the street with meals for ten or twenty yuan.

This time he would definitely make him bleed. Then he could take back some interest.

Hehehe.

Thinking this through, Xu Tian's smile became even more intense.

One by one, he called out the dish names. He didn't know how many he had ordered, as if wielding a big knife and slicing Su Nantian with each one.

The more excited he became, the more his excitement grew. He even felt himself hardening...

"Xu Tian, don't be too over the top."

Zhang Mu watched Xu Tian continuously ordering without stopping and was worried about Su Nantian not having enough money. He knew the prices here, so he spoke up.

"Oh, well then. I got too excited and couldn't control myself. Hehehe. Senior Tian, don't worry too much. It won't cost much. Besides, I'm good friends with the manager here. On my account, a discount is definitely possible."

Xu Tian looked at Zhang Mu and then at Su Nantian's smiling face, saying slowly.

"Brothers, Senior Tian has added more meals. Eat freely and enjoy yourselves. Guangliang, you've got the appetite for buffet, Senior Tian said he doesn't want to see leftovers."

Xu Tian lit a cigarette and smiled at Su Nantian.

Soon, the wine and food were served one after another.

"Unfortunately, I wanted to let Senior Tian taste the 1982 vintage of Lafite, but there was no stock. However, this year's is also quite good."

Xu Tian took the wine that was served and immediately opened it, pouring himself a glass. He also poured one for Su Nantian, respectfully raising the glass and drinking it all in one go. He closed his eyes, looking very much enjoying himself.

Su Nantian didn't even acknowledge him. He was chatting and laughing with Lin Suyun.

Xu Tian didn't mind, but his jealousy and hatred grew stronger. He drank on his own.

...

After a long time, the whole table of dishes was completely eaten without a single drop left.

Cao Guangliang and others had resentment but dared not say anything. This meal was enough for three days' worth of food, their stomachs stretched to the limit, and they felt like food was about to come up from their stomachs.

Xu Tian saw that they had eaten enough and called the server.

"Check out!"

"Sir, your total is 1.2 million yuan."

The server was also surprised. The consumption had reached over a million, which was rarely seen. She thought she could get some tips but then her smile disappeared.

Chapter 29: Slap Faces

"I'm shocked. Are you guys running a black shop? A meal cost over a million? Bring the manager here."

Xu Tian immediately jumped up, pointing at the server and shouting.

Zhang Mu wanted to say something but held back. Hearing this price, he was also shocked. He wanted to beat Xu Tian up for acting like a thief.

"Sir, this high consumption bill has been checked many times. It definitely won't be wrong."

The server's good mood disappeared immediately. She had hoped for some tips but encountered a rogue trying to eat without paying.

"You don't understand what I said, do you? I'm very familiar with the manager. Be careful I'll have him fire you. Believe me!"

Xu Tian's long-suppressed anger finally found an outlet, and his rage was uncontrollable.

The server was scared and fled hurriedly.

"Senior Tian, I didn't expect this meal to cost so much. Let me pay for it. I'm very familiar with the manager, and he can give a discount."

He turned to Su Nantian and smiled.

"That's not possible. You've already called him 'father.' How could I let this meal go without paying? Don't worry, I don't lack money."

Su Nantian brought up the incident again, deliberately provoking him.

"Senior Tian, it's fine not to lack money."

Xu Tian's eyes flickered slightly but quickly hid it.

Act, keep acting. How long can you act? A million and two hundred thousand yuan. I'll feel the pain.

I want to see where you get so much money from.

Soon,

"Ah! It's really Master Su. You didn't tell me you were coming here. I would have personally greeted you. What a big misunderstanding."

The manager hurriedly entered, first surprised then happy. He rushed forward and tightly shook Su Nantian's hand.

"Manager, let's settle the bill."

Su Nantian had to struggle for a long time to free his right hand from the manager's tight grip. Facing the manager's abnormal enthusiasm, he felt a layer of goosebumps.

Was this guy gay?

A disturbing question suddenly appeared in his mind.

Could it be that he had been thinking about my beauty since then?

The more Su Nantian thought, the more terrifying it became.

He quickly took out the black card given by the manager that day.

Xu Tian's eyes almost fell out of his head. What was going on? This level of enthusiasm was too much.

How did Su Nantian know the manager?

Black card!

Huiyun Residence's special black card.

It symbolized status and position!

Even he was only a gold VIP. How did he have it? Had he been tricked?

Cao Guangliang and others' eyes were filled with undeniable shock and horror.

They finally understood why Su Nantian had remained so calm from the beginning, looking at them like clowns.

They had been shocked many times that night. Their nerves were numb.

"Master, you're too kind. I'll pay for this meal. I really wanted to find an opportunity to thank you."

He said and tightly grabbed Su Nantian's left hand.

"You're too kind. I haven't done anything to help, so why thank me?"

Su Nantian was very confused. Did he fall in love with me that day and finally found his soulmate?

He wanted to cultivate together!

A wave of nausea came over Su Nantian, and he pulled out his left hand, placing both hands behind his back.

"Master, don't misunderstand. I actually wanted to thank you for the piece you played that day. It cured my long-standing insomnia. I've been listening to this song to sleep these days, and it's never been so stable. These years have been very stubborn, and I've never had a good night's sleep."

The manager smiled awkwardly, as if thinking of something. He quickly waved his hands and explained.

"Oh, that's right. It was a small thing. Let's settle the bill."

Su Nantian sighed in relief, glad and relieved.

He had never had such thoughts in the immortal world.

"The server did miscalculate the bill. This meal was only about 200,000 yuan. I'll give you a 50% discount and only charge 100,000."

The manager saw Su Nantian insisted on paying the bill and no longer pushed. He had a sudden idea, giving an price that left everyone shocked again. This way he could get the money and also gain a favor.

Hearing this price, Xu Tian almost vomited blood. From 1.2 million to 200,000, and a 50% discount. When had he ever received such treatment? He only got a 9.9% discount.

He wanted to hit someone, kill someone. This manager hadn't said a word to him since entering the room and had completely ignored him. What was that statement he made earlier?

This was a slap in the face!

"Manager, you must have miscalculated. How could it only be 200,000? I ordered that bottle of wine alone for over ten thousand. Do you think these dishes are free?"

He was about to explode but quickly calmed down, feeling uncomfortable.

Xu Tian wanted to cause trouble and immediately reached out to stop the server from settling the bill.

"Sir, there was no miscalculation. Today there's a lottery activity. The 219 private room won the first prize. Consumption over one million yuan is reduced by one million yuan. The server forgot to calculate."

The manager frowned, unhappy. He had just met the Master again and wanted to gain a favor. Where did this little guy come from? He was so ungrateful, and even being forgiven didn't make him happy.

The manager looked at Xu Tian then at Su Nantian, immediately realizing their relationship. He had seen such things many times here and said:

"I didn't know about this lottery."

Xu Tian was stunned, never having heard of such an offer at Huiyun Residence.

"I just won it. I haven't told you yet, so the server miscalculated. Do you understand, sir?"

The manager stared at Xu Tian's face, wanting to imprint it in his mind and add him to the blacklist. He coldly said.

Xu Tian stood silently there, speechless. The man had spoken so clearly, and he didn't want to make a fool of himself anymore. It seemed the manager hadn't considered him as a friend, no, he had no intention of knowing him.

But this face, he must get back.

After paying the bill, the manager returned Su Nantian's black card and left.

Zhang Mu could not speak. He looked at Su Nantian with respect. This meal had continuously given him many surprises. Seeing his old friend achieve such success, he was also very happy.

Xu Tian smiled on his face and said to Su Nantian:

"Senior Tian, I see everyone has eaten enough. So I've reserved a spot in the KTV. Senior Tian, would you be so kind as to accompany us for a song to digest and strengthen our feelings?"

Cao Guangliang heard this and immediately lit up. This was the time to act, so he said:

"Yes! You've shocked all of us today!"

Chapter 30: Hat Entertainment Club

"Senior Tian, yes! The brothers have all eaten enough and want to move around. Today's Senior Tian is radiant, and everyone wants to hear your achievements over the years."

Someone immediately echoed.

"Nantian, don't go. This is clearly a trap," Zhang Mu couldn't bear to see his brother walk into the fire and stopped him.

"Since everyone has extended such a generous invitation, it's not good to refuse. Then what are we waiting for? Let's go, Xiao Xu."

Su Nantian patted Zhang Mu's shoulder and gave him a reassuring look. He pulled Lin Suyun's hand and walked out.

Xu Tian glared at Zhang Mu angrily, following Su Nantian closely.

After leaving Huiyun Residence, Su Nantian looked at Lin Suyun with deep affection and said: "Suyun, it's late. You should go back first. I might be back very late tonight. You don't need to wait for me. Wash up and sleep."

He then pinched Lin Suyun's pale face.

Lin Suyun blushed and took Su Nantian's hand away. This kid was getting bolder, daring to touch his mother's face. Although she was angry, she said: "Don't worry, I'll be waiting for you in bed."

Hearing Lin Suyun's suggestive words, Su Nantian felt a tremor in his heart. "Little temptress."

"Senior Tian is so strong, making your wife so obedient. It seems Senior Tian's skills are very good. Do you have any secrets to share?" Cao Guangliang smiled with a lewd expression.

"Unexpectedly, Senior Tian has so much experience. Since your wife isn't here, you can have more fun." One person said without thinking.

Su Nantian looked at Lin Suyun as she drove away and coldly glanced at Cao Guangliang. Immediately, the atmosphere was silent.

Hearing that Lin Suyun wouldn't go, Xu Tian panicked. Tonight she had come for Lin Suyun. How could he do it without her? If Lin Suyun didn't go, how would the excitement of punishing Su Nantian reach its climax?

He opened his phone and sent a secret message, feeling much happier.

"Let's go," Su Nantian said coldly to Xu Tian, who was smiling.

"Senior Tian, please go this way," Xu Tian bowed and led the way. He was so low that even Cao Guangliang was surprised.

Soon, under Xu Tian's guidance, they arrived at the Hat Entertainment Club. Seeing the green glowing sign, Xu Tian felt a bit of confidence.

Su Nantian looked at the sign with an odd expression. The top was glowing green, and he wouldn't have entered if it wasn't to see what Xu Tian was up to.

"Senior Tian, don't look at this sign's green. This is one of the top clubs in Fengcheng. If it wasn't for me reserving a private room, you wouldn't have gotten a spot."

Xu Tian smiled and walked in with big steps.

The lights flickered, and hot young men and women kept moving their bodies, colliding with each other, full of passion and youth.

"Senior Tian, the girls here are very good. You can call a few to try later."

After entering the club, Xu Tian felt like he had regained his lost confidence. He was unusually confident and stood straighter.

Su Nantian smiled coldly, knowing that there was definitely no good intention.

Entering the private room, Xu Tiançƒ­æƒ…ly called for the girls.

"Brothers, let's have fun tonight. Everyone gets drunk and doesn't go back."

Xu Tian shouted loudly, as if he had returned to his kingdom. He held and caressed the girls with both hands, excitedly.

"Girls, please take care of Senior Tian."

Xu Tian shouted at the girls sitting next to Su Nantian.

"Yes, yes, yes."

The girls nodded but didn't want to approach. It was because Su Nantian radiated a cold aura, and even he didn't want to get close.

"Xiaohui, pour the wine."

Xu Tian looked at a girl with huge breasts and smiled lewdly, saying.

"Senior Tian, I apologize for my ignorance today. I'll drink first."

He raised the wine Xiaohui poured and drank it all in one go, but his eyes kept watching another glass.

He was eager to get started.

Su Nantian wanted to laugh. Putting drugs in the wine, such a childish method. Although Xiaohui's technique was very skilled, it couldn't escape his eyes.

Su Nantian raised the glass and drank all of it without a drop left. He didn't worry about the drug having any effect on him. In the immortal world, it might have been feared, but here, there was no threat.

Seeing Su Nantian finish the wine, Xu Tian's smile became even more triumphant. He waited silently but no unconsciousness came as expected, so he looked at Xiaohui in confusion.

Xiaohui was also confused. Normally, after taking one drop of the perfume, people would fall unconscious immediately. Even strong men like bulls couldn't last long.

"Ha ha, Senior Tian, let's have another glass."

Su Nantian smiled coldly but didn't expose it.

...

After 15 minutes, Xu Tian felt dizzy. But looking at Su Nantian, he was as if nothing had happened.

He stared at Su Nantian with determination. He wouldn't believe it.

"Senior Tian, toast."

Xu Tian raised his glass and was about to drink.

"Enough. How long are you going to act?" Su Nantian's cold voice gradually came out, devoid of any emotion.

"What are you doing? I didn't expect your secrets to be so many. Since that's the case, I won't hide anymore. Just didn't expect you to come alone."

Seeing his cover was blown, Xu Tian's smile became even more sinister.

"Xu Tian, what are you doing?"

Zhang Mu, who had been silent all along, realized something was wrong and immediately asked.

"What are you doing? I'll do it to you."

As he spoke, Xu Tian's face became more grotesque.

"You...?"

Zhang Mu looked terrified and didn't finish his sentence. He saw Xu Tian and Xiaohui already grab the bottles to hit him, so he closed his eyes and stood in front of Su Nantian.

The next moment, there was no head injury as expected.

He opened his eyes and saw Xu Tian and Xiaohui's hands were tightly clamped. Then the bottles turned over into Su Nantian's hand.

Pang! Pang!

The bottles exploded on the two people's heads. The noise in the private room disappeared instantly, only music still echoed.

Everyone stopped their actions and looked over. They hadn't figured out the situation yet.

"What are you all waiting for? Don't just stand there. Give me a go."

Xu Tian, holding his head with one hand and pointing at Cao Guangliang and the others with the other, ordered.

No one moved. No one spoke to advise them. They didn't want to get involved in this conflict.

Chapter 31: Wang Chengliang

Hearing this, Cao Guangliang's teeth were white and pale. He smiled with his mouth open, thinking this was the chance to take revenge. He grabbed a beer bottle and rushed forward. His arm muscles immediately bulged, years of training had made him strong and powerful with visible veins, full of endless strength. It was for this moment.

Looking at Su Nantian's thin and weak body, it would be so satisfying to torment him.

However, before he could imagine Su Nantian's head being split open, his arms lost sensation. Then he heard

Crack!

Ahh!

A sound of extremely painful and agonizing scream came from Cao Guangliang's mouth. He had never imagined that the weak Su Nantian would knock him down immediately.

He was a black belt fifth-degree in Taekwondo, even Xu Tian only had red-black belt.

Two more sounds followed. The two people heard it and felt their teeth were about to break.

They saw Cao Guangliang was crushed under Su Nantian's foot, unable to move. Normally, it was Cao Guangliang who knocked them down with one move. Now the invincible existence had been groaning under someone's foot.

The two people immediately felt fear. Their steps stopped, and they wanted to retreat but it was too late. Su Nantian stepped on Cao Guangliang's body with one foot and swept his other foot out. The two people were thrown against the wall and knocked unconscious.

In a flash, three people had fallen to the ground.

Xu Tian was still stunned by Su Nantian's back. From when Su Nantian attacked until he stopped, he hadn't seen clearly. In a blink of an eye, the three people had already fallen.

His heart was very scared. He clearly knew Cao Guangliang's skills, who had the qualifications to open a martial arts school. Yet he was knocked down immediately.

Su Nantian turned and looked at Xu Tian, his cold gaze showing no emotion but even colder.

"Is this your small trick?"

The cold voice entered Xu Tian's ears, and he trembled instantly. Thinking of the people behind him, he mustered his courage and shouted.

"Indeed underestimated you. I didn't expect your skills to be so good in a few years. But don't think you can leave this place alive."

Xu Tian looked at the people hiding in the corner and said, "If you help me attack him, I'll give each of you twenty thousand."

Hearing this, others were shocked. Was he planning to kill? Xu Tian was really ruthless.

But hearing twenty thousand, their thoughts became active. Twenty thousand! That's twenty thousand!

We have so many people; we shouldn't be afraid of him alone.

Many people had this thought in their minds.

Greedy eyes became more intense.

"Brothers, attack!" One person finally couldn't hold back and shouted.

With the first one, there were second and third. Soon, only a few people remained in the corner, trembling slightly but not moving forward. Perhaps they thought Xu Tian would definitely lose or perhaps out of classmate sentiment, they chose to watch.

Zhang Mu saw over twenty people rushing toward them and panicked. Although Su Nantian was very strong, it was hard to fight four.

He immediately rushed forward. Although he hadn't practiced anything, more people would make it easier for Su Nantian.

Su Nantian's eyes were calm. He directly pulled Zhang Mu back and stood behind him, then rushed toward the crowd.

Zhang Mu wanted to say something but saw people flying in the air one after another, with screams. Each punch and kick from Su Nantian sent someone flying.

Screams echoed, and soon over twenty people were lying on the ground rolling around. No one could get up.

The few people in the corner felt relieved and sighed inwardly. Otherwise, they would be lying on the ground now.

"Senior Tian, we have other things to do. We'll leave first."

One person mustered courage and timidly said. He felt that if he didn't go now, he wouldn't be able to leave.

After saying this, he walked toward the door step by step. When he reached the door, he ran out like a mouse. Then one after another, they all ran out.

Su Nantian never looked at those people but quietly watched Xu Tian.

Xu Tian was scared and looked at Su Nantian, his mouth dry. He couldn't speak for a moment.

Su Nantian didn't want to talk to this waste anymore. He directly kicked Xu Tian out, hanging on the wall.

Seeing Su Nantian walking toward him step by step, Xu Tian laughed and showed his blood-stained teeth. The red was very scary.

"Even now, you still can laugh? Are you really not afraid of death or pretending not to be?"

After saying this, Su Nantian kicked him again.

Crack!

His arm broke.

Xu Tian didn't even scream. This made Su Nantian frown and was about to kick him again.

At this moment, the door of the private room opened.

"Leave you one life first. This is your card. You should watch carefully."

Su Nantian's mouth curled with a mocking smile and lowered the other foot that was about to kick Xu Tian's testicles.

"Who dares to disturb my place?" Wang Chengliang roared with eyes wide, his face full of meaty movements. His big gold tooth was even more glaring. He roared angrily.

"Senior Wang, it's this kid who messed up your place."

Xiaohui had already been scared by Su Nantian's aura and rushed to Wang Chengliang. She pointed at Su Nantian with her hand, and her big breasts kept rubbing against Wang Chengliang's arm, almost unable to restrain.

"I see it's you. I was looking for you. How bold of you to come here yourself.

You always messed up my plans. I had to use force again because of you.

And you scared my little beauty, so I'll definitely kill you."

Wang Chengliang roared and sat on the sofa with Xiaohui, rubbing his big hand over her chest but couldn't grasp it. This made him even more excited and Xiaohui even let out a series of gasps.

He looked down at Su Nantian. This kid, even if Chen Shao didn't say it, he wanted to get rid of him. His people hadn't returned yet, making him very angry.

Wang Chengliang's "girl" was Wu Yuanying, the one Su Nantian had proposed to before. But that day when he saw Su Nantian again, Wu Yuanying decided to pursue him. So she refused Wang Chengliang's invitation that night, and he had no choice but to use force.

Wang Chengliang waved his hand and laughed loudly. He didn't believe this time could turn out anything.

Wang Chengliang's people immediately surrounded Su Nantian. These people were all good at fighting ten against one, and some had even killed people and seen blood.

Chapter 32: Crush

Combined with the batons in their hands, they had always been effective. They would beat anyone who came to cause trouble half-dead and have them kneel and beg for mercy.

"Xu Tian, watch carefully. See how your card is crushed by me, just like I'll crush your testicles."

Su Nantian turned to Xu Tian and said as if those people behind him didn't exist.

Xu Tian saw the baseball bat approaching Su Nantian's back and his pupils became more excited, filled with an uncontrollable joy.

Clang! It sounded like hitting steel. Xu Tian's pupils instantly contracted to the size of a needle, shocked at this unreasonable scene.

What the hell is this!?

Xu Tian cried in his heart.

Even the person who attacked him looked like he had seen a ghost, but he wasn't afraid. Because there were still countless batons coming down.

The clinking sound was heard, making them terrified. This person was what? Looking at the baseball bat in their hands, they were all deformed.

No one approached. They all retreated.

"Are you all doing nothing? Don't just stand there. You're a bunch of useless people."

Wang Chengliang saw his people retreating and immediately roared.

Hearing Wang's anger, they again raised their bent baseball bats and rushed forward.

Soon, people were flying everywhere. The same scene was repeated in Xu Tian's eyes. He gradually felt desperate.

Because now everyone had fallen, and Su Nantian was walking toward him.

"What are you going to do?" Xu Tian was terrified. He thought of what Su Nantian had said earlier.

Crush your testicles!

He quickly used the other hand that could still move to protect his private parts.
