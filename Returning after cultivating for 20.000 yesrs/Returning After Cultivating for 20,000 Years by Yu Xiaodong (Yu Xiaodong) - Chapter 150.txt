"Bang!"

Wu Chuan immediately shouted in anger and drew his gun, firing into the sky.

This gunshot successfully pulled back half of the security personnel's thoughts, but upon seeing Su Nantian, they were still extremely panicked and fearful, their hands gripping the guns trembling.

"Attack! I'll see who's a coward!"

Wu Chuan roared again in anger, cursing, then warned: "All of you, gather your strength! Otherwise, I'll kill you first!"

After speaking, Wu Chuan fired another shot. This gunshot shook everyone's soul, causing all security personnel to shudder and dare not defy Wu Chuan.

"Yes, Sir!"

They all responded in unison to Wu Chuan's command and fired again at Su Nantian.

Chapter 750: Solution

Although they fought desperately, Su Nantian remained calm and composed, showing no fear at all.

This attitude further enraged Wu Chuan, his face becoming even more grim.

"Everyone, attack! Don't just stand there anymore, or I'll make you regret it thoroughly!"

Wu Chuan saw his people were completely terrified by Su Nantian, no one dared to act. His expression darkened further. He cursed angrily again and barked at them, preventing them from lingering in their stupor.

"Yes, Sir!"

After hearing Wu Chuan's roar, the security personnel realized their foolishness and quickly regained their senses. They immediately tightened their grips on their guns, continuing to fire at Su Nantian. They wanted to see how long Su Nantian could endure.

At this thought, the security personnel fought even harder. They aimed their guns at Su Nantian and kept firing. Yet, Su Nantian still resisted with the solid air, effortlessly deflecting all bullets regardless of how long they persisted.

Not only could they not turn Su Nantian into a sieve, but the bullets couldn't even approach him at all.

Soon, the sound of bullets hitting the ground echoed everywhere.

"Damn it!"

After witnessing Su Nantian's abilities, Wu Chuan immediately showed an angry expression.

They truly didn't know how to deal with Su Nantian anymore. He seemed completely tireless, and even a rain of bullets was utterly useless.

After thinking about this, Wu Chuan's face darkened further. He wished to devour Su Nantian alive.

But he could only be angry here, as they were truly no match for Su Nantian.

Seeing Su Nantian effortlessly handling them, not only did the security personnel become chaotic, but Wu Chuan himself could no longer remain calm.

"Sir! Sir!"

At this moment, Li Assistant, who stood by Wu Chuan's side, suddenly lowered his voice and called out to Wu Chuan. His voice was very quiet, almost inaudible, only Wu Chuan could hear it.

"Enough. You don't need to persuade me anymore. I won't leave."

Wu Chuan, upon hearing Li Assistant's voice, didn't even glance at him and immediately interrupted Li Assistant.

Then Wu Chuan waved his hand, indicating Li Assistant to step back. He didn't want to be disturbed at this critical moment; he was already troubled enough.

At this thought, Wu Chuan's expression darkened further. He felt he was already troubled enough, and Li Assistant was adding to his problems. Wasn't this equivalent to causing more chaos?

At this thought, Wu Chuan became even more dissatisfied with Li Assistant.

"No, sir. I'm not telling you to leave. I've thought of a plan."

At this moment, Li Assistant quickly explained, fearing Wu Chuan might misunderstand.

"A plan?"

Wu Chuan was momentarily stunned. He looked at Li Assistant with doubt: "Tell me, what plan do you have?"

At this point, Wu Chuan had no thoughts anyway. Perhaps Li Assistant could come up with a plan.

At this thought, Wu Chuan slightly subdued his expression and continued to speak to Li Assistant.

Upon receiving approval, Li Assistant nodded immediately and eagerly revealed his plan: "Sir, we are currently helpless against Su Nantian. But that doesn't mean we have no plan! The safe house still has Wu You'er, who is completely helpless. We can attack her and thus deal with Su Nantian."

"Indeed, this is a good plan," Wu Chuan said upon hearing Li Assistant's words. He immediately showed an expression of sudden realization.

He had been so preoccupied by Su Nantian that he had forgotten about this good plan.

"Quick, no time to waste. Tell them to act immediately."

After thinking it through, Wu Chuan didn't hesitate but ordered Li Assistant to proceed quickly. He also told Li Assistant to prepare carefully: "By the way, be careful not to make any mistakes."

This was their last chance to turn things around. If Su Nantian discovered it, they truly had no more plans.

"Sir, don't worry. I'll be careful," Li Assistant nodded and responded immediately, not daring to resist at all. After saying this, he quickly answered Wu Chuan.

"Yes, go."

Wu Chuan nodded and waved his hand to indicate the other to leave.

"Yes, Sir!"

Li Assistant didn't dare to waste any time.

He carefully approached the security commander and whispered his plan to him.

"You should split into two groups. Leave part of your people here to distract Su Nantian, and the other group will surround and sneak into the safe house to capture Wu You'er."

Li Assistant earnestly instructed, then added: "Remember, be careful. If anything goes wrong again, you won't live to regret it."

After a pause, Li Assistant added: "Oh, by the way, be careful not to hurt Wu You'er. She needs to be used as leverage against Su Nantian."

Only a living Wu You'er could serve this purpose, so Li Assistant repeatedly emphasized to the security commander to be careful.

"Yes! Li Assistant! I remember!"

The security commander, who had been worrying about how to deal with Su Nantian, immediately regained his confidence upon hearing Li Assistant's plan and resolved to capture Su Nantian.

"Go."

Li Assistant looked at the security commander, then waved his hand to instruct him to proceed with the task.

The security commander immediately instructed his subordinates.

They followed Li Assistant's instructions, splitting into two groups. Most of them stayed here to continue firing and distract Su Nantian, preventing him from thinking about anything else.

Meanwhile, another small group carefully approached the safe house under cover, gradually closing in on the distance.

"Useless. Your shooting is just a waste of bullets to me."

Su Nantian sneered and continued deflecting the bullets. Honestly, he felt no fatigue at all and didn't find any problems.

To him, these bullets were like a light drizzle, having no real impact.

"Don't let his words affect you! Keep shooting! I don't believe he can defy fate!"

At this moment, Wu Chuan shouted again. He desperately tried to hide his emotions and maintain the same rhythm as before, fearing Su Nantian might notice something.

"Useless."

Su Nantian sneered again but didn't detect any problems.

Chapter 751: Threat

"Let go of me!"

As Su Nantian was fully focused on resisting the security personnel's bullets, a sudden scream echoed from behind him.

This voice was very familiar to Su Nantian.

Upon hearing her shriek, Su Nantian's expression changed.

No good. He was caught in a trap!

Su Nantian muttered under his breath and immediately turned around, intending to save Wu You'er.

Unfortunately, the security personnel had already planned their countermeasures. At this moment, their reaction time and speed were faster than Su Nantian's. They immediately increased the firepower, forcing Su Nantian to stay in place for self-defense and preventing him from approaching Wu You'er!

Wu You'er was taken away by Wu Chuan's people because of this reason.

"Wu You'er!"

Upon seeing Wu You'er struggling and being restrained by the security personnel, Su Nantian immediately called out her name.

But no matter how he shouted, Wu You'er was already in Wu Chuan's hands. He could not save her.

"Wu Chuan! Have the courage to face me directly! Why bother a woman?"

Su Nantian clenched his fists, angrily looking at Wu Chuan.

He hadn't expected Wu Chuan to resort to such despicable methods.

"Indeed, it's despicable."

But because he had overlooked this issue, Wu Chuan's people took advantage of the opportunity.

Thinking about this, Su Nantian cursed again and looked down on Wu Chuan even more.

"Haha. The victor is the king, the loser is the subject. What's despicable about it?"

Wu Chuan laughed arrogantly and looked at Su Nantian with a sinister gaze: "I only know that as long as she's in my hands, you must obey me, right?"

Now that Wu You'er was under Wu Chuan's control, the situation had completely changed.

Wu Chuan no longer feared Su Nantian as he did before.

At this moment, the anger and frustration on his face vanished completely. He immediately replaced it with arrogance and ease.

After speaking these words to Su Nantian, Wu Chuan smiled arrogantly: "Su Nantian, you are destined to fall into my hands!"

After saying this, the security personnel behind him also laughed happily. They had originally thought they would definitely lose to Su Nantian and face punishment.

But unexpectedly, the situation turned around. They had found a way to deal with Su Nantian, which made them so delighted.

"You!"

Su Nantian hadn't expected such a big reversal. He also hadn't anticipated Wu Chuan's complete lack of shame.

At this moment, Su Nantian could only tightly clench his fists and suppress the anger in his chest.

"Don't hurt Wu You'er!"

After struggling for a long time, Su Nantian could only say this one sentence.

He was worried that Wu You'er would suffer a bad fate under Wu Chuan's hands.

"Su Nantian, don't worry about me. Leave quickly!"

At this moment, Wu You'er suddenly shouted loudly and desperately used her eyes to signal Su Nantian to leave. She didn't want him to stay and risk his life.

Wu You'er thought that she had already caused Su Nantian enough trouble. She absolutely wouldn't let Su Nantian get hurt for her.

After all, Wu Chuan's current appearance suggested he wanted to kill Su Nantian.

"You're talking nonsense! How could I leave you behind and run away!"

Su Nantian saw Wu You'er telling him to leave under these circumstances. He was truly at a loss.

He interrupted Wu You'er's words and said to her: "Wait for me where you are! I will definitely save you!"

This sentence was also what Su Nantian said to himself.

He would never let Wu Chuan's people harm Wu You'er even a little.

"Rescue her? You have such big words! I don't think you can even save yourself!"

Wu Chuan arrogantly interrupted Su Nantian's words. He was also angered by Su Nantian's determined attitude: "Wu You'er is already under my control. Do you think you still have the ability to rescue her back?"

After saying this, Wu Chuan sneered again. He thought Su Nantian spoke so confidently as if he was certain to succeed.

"Rescue her?"

Wu Chuan coldly spoke. After saying this, he directly slapped Wu You'er, knocking her to the ground. A streak of blood slowly oozed from Wu You'er's lips, making her look pitiful.

Although it looked painful, Wu You'er didn't make any sound of pain. She was stubborn and refused to show weakness in front of Wu Chuan.

"Wu You'er!"

Upon seeing Wu You'er being slapped by Wu Chuan, Su Nantian immediately became anxious and angrily questioned Wu Chuan: "Why did you hit her!"

Su Nantian had originally thought Wu Chuan wasn't a hero, but at least he was an ambitious man.

But now he had hit a woman and used such despicable methods.

Thinking about this, Su Nantian looked down on Wu Chuan even more.

"Smack!"

As soon as Su Nantian's words of accusation came out, Wu Chuan raised his hand and slapped Wu You'er again. This time, the force was greater, and he hit her other cheek.

As a result, both sides of Wu You'er's face were swollen and had two terrifying red marks. She looked even more pitiful.

But Wu You'er still endured all the pain without making a sound of pain.

The more Wu You'er did this, the more Su Nantian felt heartbroken and angry at Wu Chuan.

"Wu Chuan! What kind of man are you!"

Su Nantian angrily shouted Wu Chuan's name.

"Haha. I'm just reminding you to be polite towards me and not try to move against the mountain!"

At this moment, Wu Chuan had the leverage in his hand and was incredibly proud. He casually replied to Su Nantian, completely different from his previous polite demeanor.

"You."

Su Nantian gritted his teeth and clenched his fists again, continuing: "What do you want?"

Now he was the one in the boat, and Wu You'er was under Wu Chuan's control.

Su Nantian had to suppress his anger and asked this key question succinctly.

"Haha, it would have been better if you had submitted earlier. Wu You'er wouldn't have suffered these physical torments."

Upon hearing Su Nantian's reasonable words, Wu Chuan immediately smiled with a meaningful expression. His eyes were also full of arrogance.

Wu Chuan spoke these cold words to Wu You'er and continued to look at Su Nantian with an arrogant gaze.

"Su Nantian! Don't worry about me. Leave quickly! Please, leave quickly!"

At this moment, Wu You'er spoke through her pain and told Su Nantian.

She really didn't want Su Nantian to be caught up because of her.

Moreover, Wu You'er didn't want to see Su Nantian get hurt because of her.

Chapter 752: Sacrificing Oneself

Wu You'er believed that, with Su Nantian's own abilities, if he ignored her and left, it would be easy for him to escape.

Thinking about this, Wu You'er immediately shouted loudly: "Leave! Don't bother with me!"

After saying that, she added: "I only ask one thing. After you leave, please save my parents!"

Wu You'er said this because she believed she would be tortured to death by Wu Chuan. This was her last words.

But at this moment, her emotions were high, and she didn't notice Su Nantian's darkened eyes because of her words.

"Silence! You traitorous wench! This is Wu family. You have the surname Wu, and you still speak for an outsider. Did he give you some kind of mind-altering potion!"

Upon hearing Wu You'er still telling Su Nantian to leave, even at this point, Wu Chuan was worried that Su Nantian might really ignore Wu You'er and leave.

He angrily glared at Wu You'er, raised his hand again to hit her.

"Stop! Don't hit her anymore! Otherwise, even if it's an egg against a stone, we'll both be ruined!"

At this moment, Su Nantian quickly interrupted Wu Chuan's actions. This sentence was also a reminder to Wu Chuan that, if necessary, they could both be ruined.

Upon hearing this, Wu Chuan's raised hand froze in mid-air and didn't dare to continue hitting her.

He also knew that Su Nantian truly had the possibility of ruining everything, so he didn't dare to hit her anymore.

"Good, good! You're really smart!"

Wu Chuan slowly spoke at this moment. His gaze towards Su Nantian carried a cold meaning, very dangerous.

Suddenly, Wu Chuan's eyes flashed with an ambiguous smile.

Su Nantian caught his smile but didn't understand Wu Chuan's intention at first, and he didn't have time to stop Wu Chuan from speaking the next sentence.

"Oh, by the way, Wu You'er, your parents didn't want to involve you. They committed suicide a few days ago. Are you going to let Su Nantian go with you to the underworld to take care of your parents?"

Wu Chuan spoke coldly, revealing this cruel truth.

These days he had been preoccupied with Wu You'er and Su Nantian's matters, almost forgetting this key point. Now that he remembered it, Wu Chuan felt it could hurt Wu You'er more.

"Stop talking, Wu Chuan!"

Upon realizing what Wu Chuan was about to say, Su Nantian immediately widened his eyes and wanted to interrupt Wu Chuan's words.

Wu You'er was already pitiful enough. Su Nantian didn't want her to suffer so much sorrow in such a short time.

But Wu Chuan spoke it all out without stopping, and he didn't give Su Nantian a chance to speak.

"Is it true?"

Wu You'er's face was pale: "My parents, they really died..."

She asked this and then suddenly lowered her head in silence.

This was definitely true.

Wu Chuan had no reason to deceive her, and Su Nantian's reaction proved everything.

If her parents hadn't been in trouble, how could Su Nantian not have refuted Wu Chuan?

"Su Nantian, don't think about it. After leaving the Wu family, you still have a bright future!"

At this moment, Su Nantian was truly panicked and didn't know how to comfort Wu You'er: "Your parents would not be at ease seeing you like this."

"A bright future? There won't be one anymore."

Wu You'er whispered and shook her head, her face full of despair.

"It really isn't."

At this moment, Wu Chuan took over Wu You'er's words and sneered again: "You will never escape from my hands in your lifetime!"

"Stop talking, Wu Chuan!"

Wu You'er was already sad enough. Wu Chuan still added fuel to the fire, and Su Nantian angrily interrupted Wu Chuan's words while trying to comfort Wu You'er.

Su Nantian was no longer doing this for the mission. He truly wanted this pitiful girl to have a happy future.

"Su Nantian, you should clearly see the situation. What chips do you have to make demands with me?"

Wu Chuan also had a temper. He was angry at Su Nantian's repeated interruptions and demands, so he became furious.

"What about me? I should have chips!"

At this moment, Wu You'er spoke softly. She didn't know when she had broken free from the security personnel's control, but she was already standing in front of Wu Chuan.

And Wu You'er was holding the security personnel's gun in her hand.

"Su Nantian, let him go."

Wu You'er held the gun. Although her face was still very pale, she looked resolute when saying this sentence.

"Wu You'er! You're rebelling! Put down your gun!"

Wu Chuan was also startled by Wu You'er. He took a step back.

The gun's muzzle pointed at his head, and the dark place made Wu Chuan feel nervous just by looking at it.

He shouted to scold her, hoping to intimidate Wu You'er.

"But now the gun is in my hands. The conditions should be set by me."

Wu You'er didn't know where she got the courage, but her words were more and more bold.

"I have so many subordinates. You only have one person. Do you think you can beat me?"

Wu Chuan hadn't expected Wu You'er to not be intimidated by him and could even propose conditions. His face became more gloomy, but he had to be careful with Wu You'er's gun.

"As long as I can kill one person, my life for your life is worth it."

Wu You'er still wasn't intimidated by Wu Chuan. Her hand didn't move, and she kept the gun aimed at Wu Chuan.

"You!"

Wu Chuan saw that Wu You'er didn't react to anything he said, and his expression also became worried. He suddenly felt a little afraid that he couldn't control this niece anymore.

"Okay, okay. Tell me your conditions."

At this moment, Wu Chuan also cooperated and raised his hands. He reminded: "Be careful not to fire accidentally."

"I said it, let Su Nantian go. Don't let anyone chase him."

Wu You'er spoke again, her voice resolute and unyielding.

"Wu You'er! What are you saying? We should all leave together!"

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian frowned and interrupted Wu You'er's words.

And Wu Chuan also didn't know why, but he felt some unease,

as if something bad would happen soon.

"Go first. I'll join you later."

Wu You'er shook her head and indicated for Su Nantian to leave first.

"What are you saying nonsense!"

Su Nantian interrupted Wu You'er's words again. How could he leave alone?

But neither of them noticed that while Wu You'er and Su Nantian were talking, Wu Chuan had exchanged a glance with Li Assistant.

Chapter 753: Mission Failure

"Attack."

Wu Chuan took the opportunity when they were distracted and made a hand signal to Li Assistant.

Li Assistant immediately understood and took out his gun, aiming at Su Nantian to catch him off guard.

"Su Nantian!"

"Wu You'er!"

Two urgent voices rang out at the same time. Just as Li Assistant pulled the trigger, Wu You'er suddenly lunged forward and used her body to block the bullet.

The red flower of blood immediately bloomed at Wu You'er's chest position.

Su Nantian was painfully stung by the red color and immediately ran forward, catching her before she fell: "What are you doing! I'm not afraid of bullets. Why did you block for me!"

Not only could Li Assistant have shot him, but even if they all fired together, Su Nantian could handle it.

But Su Nantian hadn't expected Wu You'er to be so foolish and block the bullet for him.

"I forgot."

Wu You'er weakly smiled and told Su Nantian, but she didn't tell him that at the moment she saw Li Assistant fire, her mind was completely blank and had no thoughts.

And her body also instinctively rushed forward.

"I didn't receive this shot in vain, uh..."

Wu You'er suddenly smiled, like a mischievous little cat, cunning and adorable.

But this sentence wasn't finished. Her mouth kept spitting out blood without stopping.

Su Nantian knew what Wu You'er meant. She had shot at Wu Chuan while she was rushing forward, but it only hit Wu Chuan's shoulder blade and didn't kill him.

"Stop talking. Don't speak anymore!"

Su Nantian interrupted Wu You'er's words and desperately transmitted spiritual energy to protect Wu You'er's heart meridian.

But the wound was too large, and it directly hit the heart. Even if Su Nantian transmitted spiritual energy in time, it was only a temporary fix and could only let Wu You'er live for a short while.

"Kill them!"

Wu Chuan pressed his hand on the wound. Because of excessive blood loss and pain, he was pale-faced and gave orders while being outwardly strong but inwardly weak. After giving this order, he kept breathing heavily.

"Yes, Sir!"

Li Assistant quickly ordered the security personnel to act and also fearfully supported Wu Chuan: "Sir, you're injured. I'll support you inside first!"

Li Assistant saw Wu Chuan being shot and was terrified, his heart stopped.

Fortunately, it was only the shoulder, not a life-threatening injury. It was truly fortunate!

"Don't! I want to watch them die!"

Wu Chuan angrily roared. Wu Chuan, who had been smart all his life and skilled in scheming, had never suffered such a big loss or fallen into such a big trap.

How could he not be angry?

"Fire! Shoot! I want to turn them into a sieve! Meat paste!"

Wu Chuan angrily shouted, continuously giving orders to Li Assistant.

Li Assistant saw Wu Chuan unwilling to leave and in this furious state. He didn't dare to advise again, fearing he would become a target of venting anger. So he resigned himself to stay by the side, remaining silent and not speaking much.

"Attack!"

Li Assistant gave another order.

But their bullets were no different from before, all being deflected by Su Nantian. They clattered to the ground without any bullet approaching Su Nantian.

"Stay strong, I'll take you to the hospital right away!"

Su Nantian resisted while comforting Wu You'er.

"Leave, Nan Tian. Don't bother with me. Leave!"

At this moment, Wu You'er was extremely weak and kept telling Su Nantian to leave.

"Want to leave! None of you will stay today!" Li Assistant, go! Get my gun out!"

Upon hearing Wu You'er and Su Nantian's conversation, Wu Chuan was immediately angry. He cursed and ordered Li Assistant to go get the big gun,

This was a weapon Wu Chuan had spent a lot of effort to obtain. It could be said to be the last secret weapon of the Wu family.

At first, Wu Chuan thought it was unnecessary to use such a powerful weapon against a small Su Nantian. But now, seeing this situation, if he didn't use the secret weapon, he couldn't deal with Su Nantian.

"Yes! Yes! Sir!"

Li Assistant immediately nodded and called several security personnel to carry it. He also ordered them to continue firing, suppressing Su Nantian and preventing him from moving.

"Su Nantian, you're dead!"

Wu Chuan cursed angrily. Because of his excessive excitement, it also pulled at the wound. His face became even paler. But Wu Chuan was now extremely excited, his eyes turned sinister.

"Don't bother with me. Leave!"

Upon hearing Wu Chuan's words, Wu You'er kept telling Su Nantian to leave. After saying this sentence, Wu You'er didn't know why she started convulsing. Her face also rapidly turned pale.

"I, I..."

Wu You'er's breathing became rapid. She couldn't even say a complete sentence.

"Wu You'er!"

Su Nantian frowned and called out Wu You'er's name in excitement.

He continuously transmitted spiritual energy to protect Wu You'er's heart meridian.

Unfortunately, Wu You'er could no longer respond to Su Nantian. She didn't even breathe anymore.

She was too injured, and it wasn't because of Su Nantian's spiritual energy treatment. It was only her final burst of strength.

"Wu You'er!"

Su Nantian called out Wu You'er's name again, but Wu You'er's heartbeat had stopped. Her breathing had also ceased. Even her temperature started to gradually disappear, making it impossible for her to respond to Su Nantian.

Su Nantian clenched his fists and gritted his teeth: "Don't worry, I'll avenge you!"

He would definitely make those who killed Wu You'er pay a heavy price. None of them could escape!

Thinking about this, Su Nantian clenched his fists tighter. He arranged Wu You'er's body and slowly stood up, looking at Wu Chuan with a full of killing intent.

This time, he would make Wu Chuan pay the ultimate price, paying with his life!

"Sir! They're coming!"

At this moment, Li Assistant and others quickly ran back. They carried something like a rocket launcher together.

Hastily, they placed it in front of Wu Chuan.

At this moment, Li Assistant also keenly sensed the killing intent in Su Nantian's eyes. After looking at Wu You'er who was no longer moving, he understood where Su Nantian's killing intent came from.

"Sir, what should we do now?"

Su Nantian had already been so hard to deal with before. Now, after being enraged, he was even more terrifying.

"What should we do? Obviously, attack!"

The killing intent in Su Nantian's eyes also made Wu Chuan's heart chill. He thought this way, he was even more determined to completely eliminate Su Nantian.

To end the threat forever!

Chapter 754: Mutual Destruction

"Quickly attack! Don't you see he's about to reach me!"

Faced with this fierce Su Nantian, Wu Chuan was also terrified and pale. He grabbed Li Assistant's sleeve and urgently instructed.

Wu Chuan, because he was too scared, also feared this completely different Su Nantian. His voice became sharp and high-pitched, adding a tremor to his speech, which made him even more panicked. He no longer had the calm demeanor he once had.

Li Assistant, who stood by Wu Chuan's side, also felt the same as Wu Chuan at this moment. He was also extremely afraid of this Su Nantian.

Upon hearing Wu Chuan's instructions, Li Assistant quickly regained his senses and hurriedly instructed the security commander: "Didn't you hear the sir's words? Shoot! Control him. Don't let him get close to us!"

Li Assistant urged while backing away: "Hurry up, hurry up!"

Li Assistant truly felt that they had provoked a demon.

Now the demon was angry. The ones who would suffer were them.

"Yes! Yes! Li Assistant!"

Upon hearing this, the security commander also barely regained his senses. He hurriedly instructed others: "Quick! Shoot! Don't let him get close!"

If Su Nantian got closer, they would all be doomed!

Everyone's faces were serious. They shot together, trying to block Su Nantian from approaching.

Unfortunately, at this moment, Su Nantian had completely lost his mind because of Wu You'er. He was like a god of death, killing everything in his path without any hesitation.

Compared to their current panic, Su Nantian was much calmer.

Su Nantian steadily advanced forward with each step strong and powerful.

At this moment, his only thought was to avenge Wu You'er and kill everyone!

Even if they kept shooting without stopping, Su Nantian still confidently advanced forward. His steps were never blocked.

Su Nantian directly waved his hand, and a wave of bullets was deflected. Immediately, the sound of bullets hitting the ground echoed everywhere.

These sounds were like a death signal to Wu Chuan and his people. Each of them turned pale, their hearts beating rapidly.

"Why isn't it working! Keep shooting! Don't stop!"

Wu Chuan was extremely nervous at this moment, especially as Su Nantian's distance to him became closer. His tone was even more urgent, fearing that the Su Nantian would appear before him in an instant.

He continuously urged Li Assistant and others, but they were so scared by Su Nantian that they couldn't regain their senses. No one noticed Wu Chuan's words.

They were truly in a situation where they couldn't save themselves.

"Just now, that shot was you who fired it."

At the moment they were distracted, Su Nantian had deflected all bullets and directly approached Li Assistant.

He grabbed Li Assistant's neck and coldly said: "It was you, right?"

Su Nantian knew that the bullet that had hit Wu You'er was fired by Li Assistant.

At this moment, Su Nantian was like a living阎王 (Yan Wang), and everyone was terrified by him, unable to regain their senses.

"It wasn't me! It wasn't me! The sir ordered me to shoot, I'm innocent!"

In front of life and death, everyone was afraid of dying. Li Assistant was no exception. At this moment, he quickly shifted the blame and put all the problems on Wu Chuan.

"Li Assistant! You!"

Upon hearing Li Assistant's betrayal and shifting all the problems onto himself, Wu Chuan's face changed abruptly. He looked at Li Assistant in disbelief.

At this moment, Li Assistant didn't care about Wu Chuan's gaze and questioning. He continued to explain anxiously: "It really wasn't me! It was Wu Chuan! He ordered it!"

Li Assistant said this with certainty. At this point, even the honorific "sir" was no longer used.

Clearly, Li Assistant's main thought at this moment was to survive.

"Don't worry. None of you will escape."

But Su Nantian sneered and didn't even look at Li Assistant.

A second later, he slightly tightened his grip, and Li Assistant's neck snapped.
