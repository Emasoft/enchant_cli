"Human nature is such that once one has been bullied, they tend to bully others in return, often becoming even more ruthless.
The group suggested calling Zeng Chao to confirm, and the others immediately agreed. The man promptly took out his phone and dialed Zeng Chao.
However, Zeng Chao had already prepared. His injuries were not yet healed, so he spent most of his time in his room. He was waiting for the phone to ring, as Su Nantian should have arrived on time. Indeed, the phone rang at that moment.
Zeng Chao smiled and answered the call, but his voice remained cold: “Hello, who are you?”
“Is this Master Zeng? This is Wang Dashan.”
“Wang Dashan, who is that?” Actually, Zeng Chao already knew who Wang Dashan was. He had specifically reviewed the list of personnel from the Nan Gong family in Ruo Hai District, and Wang Dashan was one of the senior figures among them.
“Master Zeng, this is Wang Dashan from Ruo Hai District.” Wang Dashan spoke on the phone but maintained a smiling, fawning demeanor. Even though Zeng Chao couldn’t see his expression, he still acted this way.
“Oh, Wang Dashan from Ruo Hai District. I remember you. What’s the matter?” Zeng Chao asked again, feigning ignorance.
“Master Zeng, a young man arrived here claiming to be from the Nan Gong family. He said he was checking on the situation. Do you know if he’s your man?” Wang Dashan continued to ask cautiously.
“Is it this person named Su Nantian? He caused some trouble in the Nan Gong family, so I sent him here. I told him to check on the situation, but in reality, you all just need to take him in. He’ll be one of your men now. Essentially, I’ve assigned a subordinate to you.”
Zeng Chao didn’t beat around the bush. He knew these people wouldn’t understand roundabout language, so he directly told Wang Dashan that Su Nantian was their subordinate to be used at will.
Upon hearing this, Wang Dashan was extremely excited and immediately said: “I see. Thank you, Master Zeng. Thank you for your kindness. My brothers will always remember your favor.”
“Handle this matter well, and you might be transferred elsewhere,” Zeng Chao said again. After all, he had the authority to move personnel within the Nan Gong family, and moving Wang Dashan would be effortless.
“Master Zeng, rest assured. With your words, I’ll definitely handle it properly. Well, I won’t bother you further.” Wang Dashan hung up the phone contentedly.
“How did it go? What did Master Zeng say?” The others gathered around curiously.
“He’s the one who offended Master Zeng and was sent here. Master Zeng said to treat him as your subordinate, doing whatever you like with him without giving him face.”
Upon hearing this, the others immediately cheered. One man quickly got up from his bed and said: “Let’s go meet him and see what kind of people they are.”
After Wang Dashan left, Su Nantian began observing the room. He noticed there were only a few tables and some computers with ash-covered keyboards, suggesting they were not focused on their work.
At that moment, he heard footsteps coming from upstairs, indicating the group had arrived.
Indeed, besides Wang Dashan, there were three others. No one else was present, confirming that this place was merely a symbolic outpost for the Nan Gong family, with only four people stationed here.
When Su Nantian saw them, he smiled warmly and said: “Hello.”
Wang Dashan then addressed the others: “These are the guys. This is the one from the Nan Gong family. Everyone, introduce yourselves. By the way, what’s your name?”
Su Nantian frowned slightly. Clearly, this man had changed his attitude toward him after going upstairs and coming back down. If Su Nantian wasn’t mistaken, he had contacted Zeng Chao to confirm his identity, and Zeng Chao must have told them not to treat him kindly.
“Strike when the iron is hot.” Since they hadn’t done anything yet, Su Nantian didn’t feel the need to overreact.
So he smiled and said: “Hello, I’m Nantian.”
“I’m Wang Dashan. This is Liu Miao, Sun Qi, and Liu Zhiping. There are only four of us here. Since you’ve arrived, you’re the fifth. So everything must follow our rules.”
Clearly, Wang Dashan was setting the tone to make Su Nantian obey immediately. But Su Nantian wasn’t someone who would submit easily.
“I don’t quite understand your meaning. Why not just say it directly? What are your demands?” Su Nantian, seeing their attitude had turned hostile, also became cold.
“You’re quite bold, aren’t you? You don’t know the order of seniority? We came first, so we’re higher in rank. Since you arrived later, you must obey us. If not, you’ll be punished. Don’t you know the rules?”
As Wang Dashan spoke, the other three slowly surrounded Su Nantian. They aimed to trap him.
“I’ve never believed in seniority. I came here for a serious matter, not to be ordered around. If you insist on these meaningless hierarchies, don’t count me in. We can coexist peacefully if we stay out of each other’s way. But if you truly want to dominate me, I advise you not to.”
Su Nantian said this with a furrowed brow and an extremely serious expression. He was not joking, but also telling them that peaceful coexistence was possible if they didn’t interfere. However, if these people truly wanted to treat him as their subordinate, the consequences would be beyond their control.
Chapter 518: Instant Elimination
Su Nantian’s stance was firm; he would never indulge these people, nor did he have reason to. He would never be their subordinate or let himself be manipulated. Thus, those who thought Zeng Chao had sent him here to command them were mistaken.
But these people hadn’t yet realized Su Nantian’s true strength; they still thought he was just a lowly figure from the Nan Gong family who had messed up and been sent here. Seeing Su Nantian speak so boldly, they all became angry.
“You’re quite tough, aren’t you? Do you know what it means to have arrived in Ruo Hai District? It means the Nan Gong family has abandoned you. Don’t care how respected you were in the Nan Gong family, but here, you must obey us! If you don’t, you won’t be able to live peacefully.” Wang Dashan said while pounding his fist, as if about to resort to violence.
“Exactly, I think you’re stubborn and don’t know when to back down. If we can’t persuade you with words, we’ll have to teach you a lesson.” Liu Miao added.
“Yes… yes… just be a good little subordinate and don’t act so high and mighty…”
Sun Qi also joined in, and Su Nantian hadn’t expected this man to be a stammerer. His speech was so grating that it made Su Nantian uncomfortable.
Su Nantian smiled, a look of disdain on his face: “Why must I obey you? If Ruo Hai District is about strength, then whoever is stronger should be followed. You four may not even be able to beat me. Why should I be your subordinate?”
Su Nantian had no intention of fighting them, but these people were so unreasonable that he realized reasoning was futile.
He had hoped to coexist peacefully with the Nan Gong family here, but these people had come looking for trouble.
If he didn’t settle them, it would be difficult to resolve the Nan Gong family’s affairs here. If he failed, he’d have to wait for Nan Gong Ping to rescue him, wasting a lot of time.
To deal with internal issues before external ones, Su Nantian decided to settle this matter through force.
Though they were more in number, he estimated each of them could be defeated in one move. Thus, ending the fight would be quick and easy for him.
It was faster than wasting words here, and after a beating, these people would respect him. Why not?
Clearly, Su Nantian’s words had enraged them further. They thought he should be beneath them based on seniority.
Moreover, Zeng Chao had said this person was sent here after causing trouble in the Nan Gong family. This person, who had messed up in the Nan Gong family, dared to be so bold—this angered them even more.
After all, they had once begged for mercy when they arrived here. This newcomer dared to be so arrogant, making it hard for the veterans to endure.
“You really are a fool! You messed up in the Nan Gong family and were sent here, yet you still act so boldly. If you want a fight, we’ll grant it. Don’t say we four bullied you!” Wang Dashan said while rolling up his sleeves.
Upon hearing this, Su Nantian understood clearly: Zeng Chao had completely informed them that he was weak and easy to bully, allowing them to torment him. Otherwise, these people wouldn’t have spoken like this.
But Zeng Chao also knew that these people’s strength was no match for Su Nantian. His real plan was to have the Sea King Gang deal with Su Nantian.
After all, he had met the Sea King Gang in Ruo Hai District and knew their strength. They were all fearless, and even though Zeng Chao was stronger, he felt uneasy around such people. Thus, he hoped that even if Su Nantian was stronger than him, the Sea King Gang would still fear him.
“Fine, then let’s stop talking and fight together. All four of you attack at once so I don’t have to fight one by one.” Su Nantian said while beckoning them with his finger, clearly unbothered.
“My temper! Brothers, don’t hold back—teach this kid a lesson and let him know who’s the boss! Go!”
Wang Dashan shouted, and the other three rushed forward with him. They relied on their numbers to believe they could easily defeat Su Nantian.
Even if they suspected Su Nantian might be strong, they thought their numbers could restrain him and thus felt no fear.
But the scene quickly spiraled out of control. When Wang Dashan and Liu Miao rushed forward to punch Su Nantian on both sides, they hadn’t expected Su Nantian’s hands to directly strike their faces.
His fists were so fast they couldn’t track the movement, and suddenly they felt darkness and intense pain. Su Nantian’s punches landed on their noses—perhaps the most vulnerable part of the face. After this punch, they were unable to recover for a while.
Sun Qi and Liu Zhiping hadn’t even reached the front when Wang Dashan and Liu Miao were already on the ground, clutching their faces in agony. They couldn’t get up.
Seeing this, Sun Qi and Liu Zhiping stopped immediately, staring at Su Nantian without moving.
“What’s wrong? Why aren’t you coming up? You said you wanted to teach me a lesson.” Su Nantian smiled at them.
“If you don’t come over, I’ll go find you.” After saying this, Su Nantian rushed toward them and grabbed each of their heads, colliding them. Instantly, both men saw stars and fell to the ground with dizziness.
Chapter 519: Unwelcome Visitors
Su Nantian had defeated the group in under three minutes. The four men were all on the ground, either clutching their faces or stomachs, crying out in pain.
Su Nantian brushed off the dust on his body and said disdainfully: “I thought you were so strong, but this is your level. Just because of this, do you think I should be your subordinate? That’s a foolish dream.”
After saying that, Su Nantian approached Wang Dashan and kicked him in the butt. “Do you still want me to be your subordinate?”
Wang Dashan, who had just been beaten, hadn’t recovered yet. Now he was kicked in the butt again and cried out in pain. He immediately pleaded: “No, no! I’m sorry! I was wrong! Brother, please have mercy!”
Su Nantian found their appearance amusing and decided not to hit them further. He said: “Fine, since you’ve realized the hierarchy between us, let’s proceed like this. I hope you won’t have any unrealistic fantasies in the future. I’ve already said before: if we stay out of each other’s way, we can coexist peacefully. If you provoke me, I’ll have to retaliate.”
After saying this, Su Nantian sat on the nearby chair and crossed his arms, watching them cry out in pain.
However, at that moment, Su Nantian heard footsteps from afar and saw five people enter the room. Upon seeing Wang Dashan and the others on the ground, they smiled and said: “Ah, it seems we arrived at a bad time. The Nan Gong family is cleaning up internally.”
Upon hearing this, Su Nantian remembered these people were the Sea King Gang who had met him when he first arrived in Ruo Hai District.
At that moment, Wang Dashan and the others, despite their pain, quickly got up and smiled at Su Nantian. “Master Qiao, you’ve arrived.”
After saying this, Wang Dashan and the others also gave Su Nantian a meaningful glance. Clearly, this person was no easy opponent.
Upon seeing this, Su Nantian realized he didn’t need to create conflict immediately. He stood up from the chair and smiled, extending his hand: “Master Qiao? I just arrived here and don’t know the rules yet. Please forgive any shortcomings.”
It wasn’t that Su Nantian was afraid of them, but he had come here primarily to resolve the Nan Gong family’s affairs. If he started a conflict immediately, it would create many enemies and possibly restrict his actions later.
Although Su Nantian knew Zeng Chao’s so-called harassment and threats were likely from these Sea King Gang members, he didn’t want to clash immediately.
“Newcomers really are bold. You arrived and already taught the Nan Gong family’s people a lesson. Does that mean you were sent here to take charge?” This Qiao looked at Su Nantian but didn’t shake his hand, indicating his attitude was clearly不满.
“I just had a little sparring. It’s not really about teaching them a lesson. I heard that in Ruo Hai District, strength is the key—those who are stronger become leaders. These people wanted to be my leader, so I had to use fists to tell them I was the real leader.”
Su Nantian now implied criticism, though he spoke about his fight with Wang Dashan and the others. However, this Qiao’s behavior had clearly angered him.
“Good for saying strength is the key. That’s right, our rules are like that—those with strong fists become leaders. But your Nan Gong family here must obey us Sea King Gang’s leadership. We came today for no other reason than to collect your payment.” This Qiao said and extended his hand, indicating they should pay.
“Master Qiao, you forgot—this month’s payment has already been made. You came a few days ago, right? Why are you asking for money again?” Wang Dashan said with a sad face. He knew Qiao hadn’t forgotten but was deliberately asking for money.
“I haven’t forgotten. The previous payment was for your group, but now that a new person has arrived in the Nan Gong family, you need to pay again. And since you’re living in our Ruo Hai District’s house, an additional payment is required for the new person.”
This Qiao said while gesturing with his hand, indicating they should pay immediately.
“No, Master Qiao, how can you charge like this? We had agreed to pay once a month before. Why now is it based on the number of people? Also, this house isn’t Nan Gong family’s property here… why is it about rent?”
Wang Dashan spoke, but his voice grew quieter as Qiao’s group started rolling up their sleeves and preparing to fight.
“Since when do you need our permission to collect money? If you don’t want to pay, ask my fists.” This Qiao said while shaking his fist in front of Su Nantian.
“Master Qiao, you must give us some time. We just paid you this month. We don’t have money now; all our payments come from the Nan Gong family monthly, and we pay you. If you want us to pay now, where would we get the money?”
Wang Dashan’s words were true. They really had no personal money here, as they knew if they held onto it, it would eventually be taken by these people. So they let the Nan Gong family deposit their salaries into another account, and they only took out enough for meals.
“Then you should call the Nan Gong family now, telling them we Sea King Gang saw your new person and want more money. See if they’re willing.” After saying this, Qiao immediately pulled a chair and sat there, blocking the door. It was clear he wouldn’t leave until they paid.
Wang Dashan saw this and knew there was no way around it, so he called the Nan Gong family to ask for money.
They usually contacted Zeng Chao, so he took out his phone and dialed again to ask what they should do.
Chapter 520: Internal Energy
Wang Dashan took out his phone and dialed Zeng Chao. After a while, the call connected, and Wang Dashan immediately said with a sad face: “Master Zeng, the Sea King Gang came again. They said they want this month’s payment.”
Zeng Chao, hearing the words on the phone, was surprised and replied: “What payment? Didn’t you already pay them this month?”
“Yes, Master Qiao said we have a new person today and need to pay again. Also, they said we’re living in their Ruo Hai District’s house, so another rent is required.” Wang Dashan relayed the message to Zeng Chao.
After hearing this, Zeng Chao smiled and said: “So it’s because of Su Nantian, right? That’s why they’re asking for money.”
Wang Dashan glanced at Su Nantian but said nothing, only nodding.
“Then you don’t need to handle this matter. Let Su Nantian deal with it himself. Since he’s the one who needs to pay, let him do it. There’s nothing else for me to handle. If there’s anything, contact Su Nantian—he was specifically sent here to help you. Hang up.” After saying this, Zeng Chao hung up the phone immediately. Wang Dashan hadn’t finished speaking when he heard the call disconnect, so he turned around and looked at Su Nantian.
“How did it go? Did Zeng Chao say to pay?” The Sea King Gang asked.
Wang Dashan smiled awkwardly and pointed at Su Nantian: “Master Zeng said if it’s because of the new person, you should contact Su Nantian. He’s in charge. We’re just subordinates and have nothing to do with it. Now all the matters in Ruo Hai District under the Nan Gong family are his responsibility.”
After Wang Dashan said this, he and Liu Miao, Sun Qi, and Liu Zhiping stood behind Su Nantian, clearly acting like subordinates.
These people had just been provoked by Su Nantian but now immediately recognized him as their leader. This made Su Nantian feel somewhat amused.
“Good, did you hear that? Your subordinates said this matter is now under your control. Pay us the money.” This Qiao said and extended his hand toward Su Nantian.
Su Nantian could only smile and say: “Master Qiao, I just arrived today. I don’t know the Sea King Gang’s rules yet. You suddenly asked for money, and I have no money to give you. Also, in the Nan Gong family, I’m just a worker; I don’t have much money to give you. Let’s say next month, and I’ll talk to the Nan Gong family to get more money for you.”
However, Su Nantian’s words seemed to anger the Sea King Gang. They “stood up” from their chairs and Qiao pointed at Su Nantian’s head: “What kind of tone are you using? Do you think we’re beggars to be dismissed like this? You said next month, but now you must prepare the money immediately. Otherwise, we’ll do ten times worse to you.”
Su Nantian was somewhat surprised; he thought his words had no issues, but this person clearly wanted to provoke him. Today, it seemed he couldn’t avoid a fight.
Su Nantian had come to Ruo Hai District intending to first familiarize himself with the environment, understand the rules here, and what these people usually did. He had planned not to fight them immediately, but today it seemed he couldn’t avoid it.
“Master Qiao, are you being too pushy? I just arrived today, and you saw it was just now. Now you’re asking for money. Where would I get the money? Even if you strip me naked and search my whole body, I don’t have a single coin for you.” Su Nantian stood up and patted Qiao’s shoulder.
But Qiao immediately hit Su Nantian hard, sending him flying: “Then we’ll strip you and parade you in the street! Get him!”
With Qiao’s shout, his subordinates rushed forward to subdue Su Nantian. Two men grabbed Su Nantian’s arms, and one hugged his waist to control his lower body. Thus, Su Nantian had no place to move, and the remaining two prepared to beat him.
Wang Dashan and the others were trembling at this moment, but each of them felt a bit of schadenfreude. After all, they had just been beaten by Su Nantian, and now seeing him get beaten made them feel somewhat happy.
So they looked very afraid on the surface, but inside, they felt quite pleased.
However, Su Nantian suddenly roared and shook off the people restraining him. They were momentarily stunned; they had restrained Su Nantian, and he should have no place to exert force. But inexplicably, Su Nantian used his internal energy to shake them all off.
Actually, if Su Nantian only knew external martial arts, it would have been difficult to escape under the circumstances of being held by their limbs. But since Su Nantian knew internal energy, his qi directly shook them all away, leaving them unable to move and crying out in pain.
Seeing this, Qiao immediately couldn’t sit still; he knew this person was a martial artist. Otherwise, how could he have defeated these people so easily under such circumstances?
He had thought Su Nantian was just a street fighter before, but now he realized he was truly a martial artist.
“Unexpectedly, you’re a martial artist. That’s why you were so bold. I asked you about Ruo Hai District’s rules, and now I see your fists are strong. You think you can carve out a place here? I tell you, it’s not that simple. As long as we Sea King Gang are here, no newcomers can rise. Today was our bad luck; get up and leave.”
Wang Dashan and the others were shocked. They hadn’t expected Qiao to back down. Although he didn’t say he had lost, his words clearly indicated his stance. If he hadn’t backed down, he could have fought Su Nantian himself, but now he ordered his subordinates to leave. What else could it be but fear?
The people on the ground heard Qiao’s words and struggled to get up, then followed him out.
Chapter 521: Escalation of Conflict
Seeing Qiao and the Sea King Gang leaving, Wang Dashan and the others felt relieved. At least this matter was over for now. As for what would happen later, it was Su Nantian’s burden to bear. They couldn’t make decisions themselves. When the sky falls, a tall person will hold it up; they naturally followed Su Nantian.
But Wang Dashan and the others hadn’t expected that, as Qiao and his group were about to leave, Su Nantian suddenly kicked him hard, sending him flying face-first and falling out of the door.
Wang Dashan and the others were stunned, their mouths open in shock, as if frozen. They hadn’t expected Su Nantian to be so bold; after all, they had just finished the fight, but he instead beat Qiao.
Actually, this was Su Nantian’s intention. According to his plan, he hadn’t intended to fight today, but Qiao had been so pushy.
Since he had already fought with the Sea King Gang, he might as well escalate the conflict further to delve deeper into their plans. If they truly needed to resolve this through a fight, Su Nantian would be even more fearless.
After all, Su Nantian knew that others finding it difficult to beat him was true. Even he could confidently say that in the world, people who could match his strength were hard to find.
Qiao got up from the ground and suddenly touched his nose, revealing that Su Nantian’s kick had made him fall and his nose bled.
But the Sea King Gang’s subordinates dared to be angry but not speak out, as they could still use their authority. However, after being taught a lesson by Su Nantian, they knew that if they turned back to curse him, it would only bring them trouble.
Qiao wiped the blood from his nose and turned to point at Su Nantian: “You’ll regret this. Today’s matter I remember, and you won’t be able to survive in Ruo Hai District under the Nan Gong family! We’re leaving!”
After saying this, Qiao left with his subordinates.
Wang Dashan and the others watched the Sea King Gang leave completely, then approached Su Nantian: “You’ve really caused a big problem! If the Sea King Gang comes for you later, we won’t protect you. You’ll have to take your chances.”
After saying this, Wang Dashan and the others prepared to go upstairs. But Su Nantian grabbed him.
Wang Dashan realized his words were too harsh, forgetting that he had been beaten by Su Nantian before. He spoke to him in the same tone as before.
Wang Dashan could only submit, looking sad and saying: “Big brother, don’t hit me again.”
“Sit down,” Su Nantian said calmly but without anger.
So Wang Dashan sat beside Su Nantian and said: “I was wrong, big brother. I truly was wrong.”
“Fine, don’t do this. I won’t hit you; I just have a few questions for you.”
Upon hearing this, Wang Dashan nodded: “Ask anything. I’ll tell you what I know.”
“How long have you been here? Have you never thought of leaving? The environment here is so harsh. If you want to resign from the Nan Gong family, no one can stop you?” These security guards were all hired by the Nan Gong family. So if they felt the environment was harsh, they could certainly quit.
Wang Dashan rubbed his head and said: “Five years here. We stay because the pay is high. Here, a month’s salary equals half a year outside. Although these years have been tense, they only want money. As long as the Nan Gong family pays on time, they won’t bother us unless we’re really unlucky and hit the wrong spot.”
After hearing this, Su Nantian nodded. It matched his guess. He knew these people stayed because of the high salary.
“You’ve seen this scene, and now I’ve truly offended the Sea King Gang. Please tell me everything you know about them. Also, what position does this Qiao hold in the Sea King Gang?”
Su Nantian knew the principle of knowing your enemy and yourself. He had no idea about the Sea King Gang, only that they were a violent gang exploiting several families. To break through this situation, he needed to infiltrate their internal structure.
“Qiao is just a team leader in the Sea King Gang. The Sea King Gang has many people, and they usually don’t limit their actions to Ruo Hai District. They also take jobs outside secretly, but no one notices them. After all, they had a pact with the ordinary side, allowing them to do whatever in Ruo Hai District. But once they leave Ruo Hai District and commit crimes, they won’t be lenient.”
At this moment, Sun Qi suddenly spoke.
“So the only people you can contact are Qiao, a team leader. Do you know anyone else in the higher ranks? Have these families never resisted?” Su Nantian nodded and continued asking.
“The Sea King Gang’s other people I’ve seen, but only in passing. We never communicated with them. As for resistance, a few years ago the Wang family tried to resist. When the Sea King Gang came to collect money, they called many people and beat those collecting. That night, the Sea King Gang surrounded their store but didn’t attack them directly; they just took those people away. After that, we never saw them again. Later, the Wang family sent a few more people to replace them, and since then, no such incidents have occurred.”
After Wang Dashan said this, he suddenly looked shocked at Su Nantian and continued: “Nantian Brother, I feel like this is familiar. Tonight you won’t…”
Upon hearing this, the others nodded as well. They also noticed that Su Nantian had beaten Qiao today and feared the Sea King Gang would send people to take him.
“If that’s the case, then tonight you should avoid the storm and leave it to me alone,” Su Nantian said while feeling a bit of anticipation.
Chapter 522: Escalation
Actually, Su Nantian wasn’t afraid of the Sea King Gang coming to bother him now. He was more worried they wouldn’t come.
If the Sea King Gang truly came to take him as Wang Dashan said, he could immediately infiltrate their internal structure. If they were truly a place where strength ruled, then solving this problem would be too easy for him.
Originally, Su Nantian had thought he might need a few days to find his way in. But by escalating the conflict today, according to what Wang Dashan said, he might have a chance to meet with higher-ranking members of the Sea King Gang.
So Su Nantian’s face showed no fear but rather anticipation. Wang Dashan saw this expression and shook his head in无奈, thinking this Nantian was crazy.
They had fought with Su Nantian before and knew his skills were much better than theirs. Also, they knew Qiao wasn’t a strong person in the Sea King Gang but just a team leader. There were many stronger people in the Sea King Gang, so if Su Nantian was truly taken by them, he would face people much stronger than Qiao.
Then the person who would teach him a lesson would be even more powerful, and he might not be able to withstand it. If that happened, who knew what would happen? And Su Nantian represented the Nan Gong family. If he couldn’t resist, they might also suffer.
Thinking about this, Wang Dashan looked at each other and said to Su Nantian: “Nantian Brother, maybe you should apologize to the Sea King Gang now. It’s still possible to get a chance. They’ll only beat you once. Then we can quickly call the Nan Gong family to send money, otherwise your situation will only get worse tonight.”
