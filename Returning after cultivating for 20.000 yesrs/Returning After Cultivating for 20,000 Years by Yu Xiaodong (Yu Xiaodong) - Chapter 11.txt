Fate, it seems the young lady might indeed have a chance of recovery.

Chapter 46: Beauty That Leaves One Breathless

Su Nantian followed Gao Peng into the Gao family estate. The black Audi pulled up slowly to the entrance of the Gao estate. It was a mountain—entirely a mountain. Scattered buildings clung to the slopes, surrounded by lush greenery. The most striking feature was a grand structure at the mountain's peak, its imposing presence visible even from the base. Dragon heads soared upward while phoenixes coiled in regal stillness.

Su Nantian could sense the auspicious feng shui and natural spiritual energy converging here, yet it felt stagnant. A rare gem of a location, but alas.

He shook his head slightly. "This estate was built with great effort by the master, each structure positioned with profound and mysterious significance. It was guided by many esteemed feng shui masters. Why do you shake your head, Master Su?" Gao Peng's expression darkened slightly at Su Nantian's gesture but he remained composed. "Nothing in particular. I'm not well-versed in feng shui, but I feel a sense of loss." "Ah, Master Su has insights?" Gao Peng was puzzled. How could he be so assured without knowledge of feng shui? Yet he held no anger, for he recognized Su Nantian's formidable strength. Though not witnessed firsthand, it was undeniable. "Nothing remarkable—just the air feels lifeless." Su Nantian replied. "Master Su jests, I feel no such thing," Gao Peng mused, his confusion deepening. "It's because your perception is weak." Su Nantian smirked without explanation. Gao Peng was speechless.

"Hmph, I think you're just boasting. This place is lush with green mountains and clear waters, birds and beasts abound—where's the lifelessness?" The black-clad young driver finally snapped. "Gao Yi, how dare you speak to Master Su like that? Apologize at once," Gao Peng's expression darkened. Though he too felt irritation, for the faint hope of curing Miss Gao, he swallowed his pride. "I'm sorry, Master Su," Gao Yi muttered reluctantly after a pause.

"I said the air feels lifeless because it's true. The feng shui is good, but spiritual energy here is trapped, turning into stagnation. Haven't you noticed your cultivation has slowed?" Gao Peng's eyes lit up—indeed, their cultivation had notably slowed in recent years. Otherwise, he would have already broken through his realm long ago. "Master Su, is there a solution?" Gao Peng asked urgently, heart pounding. "There is, but..." Su Nantian paused mid-sentence. "If you can resolve it, anything is acceptable," Gao Peng said. "Nothing too demanding—just a material I need: the jade you gave me, as much as possible," Su Nantian smiled. "Master Su, do you also know formations?" Gao Peng seemed to realize something, his voice trembling with excitement. "Formations? I've heard of them from the old master, but no one knows how to use them. The old master searched endlessly for such people and eventually gave up, turning instead to feng shui masters." "A little," Su Nantian replied. "I'll do my best," Gao Peng said, his excitement palpable. He now believed more than ever that Miss Gao's illness might be cured by this man.

"I don't believe you can do it. If you succeed, I'll be your disciple," Gao Yi said, his disdain for Su Nantian evident. The Gao family had no solution—how could this man? "Gao Yi, don't be foolish," Gao Peng said, careful not to reprimand too harshly. After all, he was the son of Gao Tianlang. And for his cousin's sake.

"It's fine," Su Nantian smiled, sensing Gao Yi's nature wasn't truly malicious—just impulsive.

At last, the car reached the mountain's peak. Gao Peng led Su Nantian past the opulent mansion and into a stone house at the back. Inside, an elderly man sat in a wheelchair, his face etched with sorrow. Behind him stood a middle-aged man.

Upon seeing Gao Peng returning with a young man, the old man's eyes brightened. "Master Gao, I've brought you the person you sought," Gao Peng bowed respectfully to the elderly man in the wheelchair. The old man was Gao Qingyun, the patriarch of the Gao family, with Gao Jin and the old steward as his trusted advisors. Without them, the Gao family would never have achieved its current status.

Gao Qingyun had suffered from a hidden illness since youth, achieving little until his old age when it struck him down. "Greetings, Master Gao," Su Nantian greeted without bowing, as one would to a friend. "Young master, I assume you know why I've come. My granddaughter Gao Jingjing has long suffered from a strange illness—every so often, her body turns icy cold. In the past few years, it's become more frequent. Some say this is divine punishment, but I don't believe it. That's why I've summoned you." Gao Qingyun sighed, his eyes glistening. When he heard Lin Tianyi's paralysis was cured by a young man, hope flickered in his heart. Even if it seemed distant, he was willing to try.

"Master Gao, I've understood the situation. Whether I can heal her depends on examining her first." Su Nantian felt no authority from the elder, only a man desperate for his granddaughter's recovery.

"Oh, I almost forgot," Gao Qingyun smiled awkwardly. Gao Peng pushed open a stone door, and Su Nantian felt an immediate chill. He deduced instantly. "Master Gao, I prefer to be alone while treating her." Gao Qingyun nodded. The stone door closed slowly.

Inside the room, a woman lay on a stone bed—ethereal in beauty, her skin snow-white with a faint sheen. Her long lashes were frosted over, yet her face bore an enchanting smile. Her jet-black hair cascaded over the pillow, still as if asleep. No wonder they used stone; its temperature regulation was exceptional. By day it absorbed heat, by night maintaining a balance with Gao Jingjing's coldness. If the room's temperature were raised, more coldness would be trapped within her body.

Chapter 47: Unexpected Joy

Su Nantian placed his hand on the lifeless wrist of Gao Jingjing, feeling a faint pulse. It was easy to overlook if not carefully sensed. An Extreme Frost Body! A rare occurrence indeed. The purity of her body was ninety percent—exceptionally pure. Such a constitution made ice-element cultivation effortless, with rapid progress.

He retrieved silver needles, glancing at her flawless face and the mountain-like curves of her body. He felt a twinge of hesitation, rarely taking advantage of others, especially women. He had planned to first use the needles to protect her heart's pulse before employing his Xu Ling Purple Flame to dispel the coldness. But he would need another method now.

Su Nantian gently lifted Gao Jingjing, seating her on the bed. His hands rested on her back, feeling an icy chill. Slowly channeling his spiritual energy into her heart's pulse, he guided the coldness from her body into himself. Instantly, the coldness surged like a breached dam, rushing into Su Nantian's meridians. He quickly used his Xu Ling Purple Flame to neutralize it. The flame, a celestial essence of supreme yang, soon dispelled the coldness. Yet strangely, it didn't vanish—it transformed into a warm current flowing toward his dantian.

He hadn't directly used the flame within her body to avoid overloading her system. Soon, he felt his own spiritual energy depleting rapidly. He withdrew his hands decisively. His strength was still weak; otherwise, he could have absorbed more.

Su Nantian sighed, having only managed to absorb a quarter of the coldness. Gao Jingjing's coldness was far more than expected. Yet he was delighted—his realm had advanced to the third level of cultivation.

If Gao Jingjing had started with ice-element cultivation, she could have controlled it better. The current state was due to uncontrolled coldness accumulation. When Su Nantian removed his hands, Gao Jingjing's body seemed to lose support and fell into his arms. Her icy form softened, becoming pliant.

As Su Nantian prepared to place her down, she suddenly awoke. Her pure, unblemished eyes opened, gazing directly at him. The atmosphere was delicate.

"Thank you," her voice rang out, like water flowing over pebbles in a forest. "You're welcome," Su Nantian smiled, thinking thankfully he hadn't undressed her—she awoke so quickly, leaving no time for clothing.

"Long has it been since I felt such warmth. It's as if I've slept for twenty thousand years," Gao Jingjing said, her pale face flushing with two red spots. "If you like it, I can hold you tighter," Su Nantian said impulsively, even he was surprised by his own words. "Yes," Gao Jingjing whispered, then closed her eyes.

...

"How long has it been? He's not coming out. Is he a fraud? What if he does something to my sister?" Gao Yi grew impatient. "The longer it takes, the more likely Miss Gao's condition will improve. Let's wait. This young man has always been enigmatic; he might bring us a surprise," Gao Peng said. "Indeed, Xiao Yi, learn from Uncle Peng. Your impatience will never lead to success," Gao Qingyun said. "Understood, Grandpa." "He's coming out," Gao Peng said.

The stone door opened. Gao Jingjing supported Su Nantian as they exited. Everyone was stunned by the sight.

Gao Qingyun's tears nearly flowed—unbelievable, Gao Jingjing had awakened. He'd thought she would never wake again.

"Thank you, young master, for your assistance," Gao Qingyun bowed. "No need to thank me. Healing is my duty. Besides, Miss Gao's condition isn't fully cured yet—only temporarily relieved." Su Nantian said. He had once wanted to study medicine but found the entrance exams too difficult, always longing for a doctor's life.

"What must be done to fully cure her? The Gao family will do anything," Gao Qingyun said, excitement in his voice. "Don't worry, it's just a matter of time. To be precise, she doesn't have an illness—her Extreme Frost Body caused it. Without proper guidance, the coldness occasionally surges." "An Extreme Frost Body? How is it treated?" Gao Qingyun asked. Everyone was puzzled—this term was unfamiliar.

Gao Yi still doubted Su Nantian, thinking he was bluffing. Yet seeing his cousin awaken, he felt joy.

"My current strength is still weak; I've only dispelled a quarter of her coldness. In three years, I'm confident I can cure Miss Gao. The method is confidential," Su Nantian said. The Xu Ling Purple Flame was too significant to reveal.

"No problem, you are our great benefactor. I'll express my gratitude in advance," Gao Qingyun said again.

"Master Su, would you grace us with a meal?" Gao Peng was surprised. A cultivator at the ninth level of refinement, weak? Did he need to reach the innate realm to heal her?

Three years to enter the innate realm—this was terrifying. Some people never achieved it, requiring talent, strength, luck, and opportunity. He wouldn't dare hope for such a feat. Yet this young man was increasingly inscrutable.

"Sure," Su Nantian agreed readily.

...

At the banquet table, Su Nantian and Gao Qingyun conversed amicably, learning many things he hadn't known before. He discovered that the cultivation world had always existed, even with ancient families.

Gao Qingyun had once been a disciple of the Yunliu Peak of Cangshan, but his talent was poor, remaining at the cultivation level. He often faced bullying until he realized he'd never become a powerful cultivator. Taking his two younger disciples, Gao Jin and Gao Peng, he ventured into the secular world, building the current Gao family. Though they were from a major cultivation clan, they knew some martial arts and techniques, gradually cultivating their own cultivators. Though all were at the cultivation level, they were far stronger than ordinary people.

Chapter 48: Mysterious Stone

This stone secured the Gao family's status in the secular world. Gao Qingyun had two sons, Gao Tianlang and Gao Tianyuan, with Gao Yi being Gao Tianlang's son. Gao Jingjing was Gao Tianyuan's only daughter. Thus, Gao Qingyun doted on her greatly.

When Gao Jingjing learned this, she was shocked. No one had ever mentioned it before; she hadn't known her grandfather came from a cultivation clan.

Though they knew the family was different from others, they hadn't realized its background was so vast. "I never told you these things to avoid burdening you. Your health is already poor; I just wanted you to live happily," Gao Qingyun explained, seeing her confusion.

"Grandpa, is it possible for me to cultivate the family's techniques now?" Gao Jingjing asked, her heart eager. Cultivation was something she thought existed only in novels—now it was right before her.

"This, let's ask the young master," Gao Qingyun hesitated, worried about affecting her condition. Cultivation required both body and mind.

"Master Gao, don't worry. An Extreme Frost Body is ideal for cultivation, and her talent is high. However, she can't practice techniques now—her coldness is too much to control. After a few more treatments, it'll be fine," Su Nantian said honestly.

"That's great! I can cultivate too!" Gao Jingjing was delighted. "But your family's techniques aren't suitable for her. She should cultivate ice-element techniques," Su Nantian said.

"Gao family techniques guide spiritual energy too slowly. With today's sparse spiritual energy, it's hard to reach the innate realm. If I'm not mistaken, your family has no innate-level cultivators," Su Nantian said.

"Master Su is truly remarkable. You could discern this so easily. Don't worry, Gao Jingjing, I'll find a suitable ice-element technique for you," Gao Qingyun said, astonished. He was shocked that the Gao family's strength had been exposed so easily, even their techniques no longer a secret.

Gao Qingyun felt bitter. Hearing of Gao Jingjing's high talent, he was delighted—perhaps the Gao family could produce a genius. But the techniques immediately made him feel disheartened. Not only was an ice-element technique hard to find, but even the Gao family's ordinary techniques were scarce.

"Don't worry, Master Gao. I have one here," Su Nantian seemed to sense something.

"How could that be?" Gao Qingyun was shocked. This young man could just produce a technique—what world did he come from?

"It's fine, it's a gift for Miss Gao," Su Nantian said. If Gao Jingjing could cultivate, he was happy—this technique meant nothing to him.

"Thank you, Master Su," Gao Qingyun didn't refuse. This gift was too precious; perhaps he had taken an interest in Gao Jingjing.

"Master Su, I have another request," Gao Qingyun said. "Please speak." "Miss Gao's condition still needs your treatment, but she's currently in university. Would you stay with her?" "This..." Su Nantian hesitated—it was a strange move. "That's great! I won't have to worry about her condition recurring and not finding you," Gao Jingjing was delighted, grabbing Su Nantian's arm instinctively. "Then okay," Su Nantian hesitated, then agreed. After all, staying with Lin Suyun wasn't a solution.

After the meal, Gao Qingyun led Su Nantian to the family's secret chamber. "These are treasures I've collected over the years. Take a look if you find anything suitable. Sorry, I don't have any spiritual stones," Gao Qingyun said awkwardly. He had prepared to give the family's techniques but was surprised when Su Nantian gave him one instead. He had nothing to offer.

Su Nantian looked around the chamber, which wasn't large but filled with items. Many were antiques, yet none caught his eye. Suddenly, he noticed a black stone in the corner.

"This was obtained years ago at an auction of a martial artist from Yanzhou. No one bid, so I bought it. Otherwise, I'd have returned empty-handed. Later, I never figured out what it was—it's very hard," Gao Qingyun said, surprised Su Nantian had noticed it.

Su Nantian felt the stone's coolness. It wasn't heavy but extremely hard. He pinched it, leaving no mark.

Perhaps the Xu Ling Purple Flame could melt it.

"I'll take this stone," Su Nantian said, satisfied. "Then so be it," Gao Qingyun's face was slightly embarrassed. After all, he hadn't spent much on it.

"This stone is a great bargain," Su Nantian comforted him. If he could melt it to forge a weapon, he'd profit greatly.

"That's fine," Gao Qingyun thought Su Nantian was comforting him. After all, the stone had no use for him.

Soon, Su Nantian left the Gao family with their warm farewell and returned to the Lin family. When he told Lin Suyun he was moving out, her face darkened immediately, refusing to agree. After Su Nantian's persuasion, she reluctantly agreed. But the house would be paid for by the Lin family, and she'd move in too.

Su Nantian felt his head ache. Sharing a room with two beauties—how could he resist? No, it was three: Yao Lina, that little temptress, would occasionally torment him.

Thinking about it made him excited. Su Nantian returned to his room and took out the dark stone. He summoned his Xu Ling Purple Flame, blue-purple flames flickering in his hand. Placing the stone on his palm, it hovered above the flame.

Ten minutes... Su Nantian was surprised—it showed no reaction, not even a trace of melting. How could this be? In the celestial realm, Xu Ling Purple Flame could melt anything. Had it weakened upon returning to Earth?

He wasn't giving up, so he roasted it for another ten minutes. Finally, he gave up. He was puzzled—never before had he encountered such an odd object. First the token, now this stone.

Su Nantian picked up the stone, wondering if he needed to blood-test it. Blood-testing a stone? The thought made him jump.

He bit his finger, drawing blood and dropping it on the stone. He felt reluctant—his blood was precious; it could even revive the dead. In the celestial realm, countless elixirs had infused his blood.

Then, the blood was absorbed by the stone. Yes, it was absorbed.

Chapter 49: Buying a House

"Ghost! It worked!" The dark stone's surface gradually turned transparent. Su Nantian's eyes gleamed—was this a spatial realm? He was overjoyed. Though he couldn't understand why it was wrapped in an indestructible black material, he could clearly sense a separate space inside—vast and expansive. This was the main component for creating a storage realm; the rest would be easy.

Unexpectedly, Earth had such an item. It was the best material for creating a storage realm—rarely found, usually existing in the chaotic voids of the celestial realm. And it required immense luck to obtain.

Knock knock knock! The doorbell rang. He opened the door and saw Lin Suyun, dressed in a new outfit—clearly carefully styled. Especially the black bodycon skirt that accentuated her figure, making him want to run his hands over it.

"South Tian, let's go look at houses. It's still early," she said. "Okay!" Lin Suyun pulled Su Nantian's hand, entering a red Lamborghini. Soon, the car stopped at Hengyuan Real Estate's parking lot. The saleswomen immediately perked up—luxury car, handsome man, beautiful woman—definitely a wealthy client. If they could close this deal, their commission would be huge. Imagine buying the latest LV bag.

So the saleswomen without customers all looked in the mirror. Lin Suyun and Su Nantian entered the sales hall, immediately drawing attention. They became the center of focus. Lin Suyun wasn't uncomfortable; Su Nantian didn't care about others' gazes. The jealous and envious looks were ignored.

"Hello, I want to buy a house near Fengyue University. Preferably four to five rooms, around 180 square meters, good lighting and quiet environment. Ideally close to the sea," Lin Suyun said without hesitation.

After learning Su Nantian would live with Gao Jingjing, she immediately investigated Gao Jingjing's background. Though the Lin family was weaker than the Gao family, it was easy to find information on a person—especially one as prominent as Gao Jingjing.

Lin Suyun specifically checked Gao Jingjing's romantic life, finding it blank. Though many pursued her, there were no scandals—this made her wary. The more so, she was cautious; it might be someone after Su Nantian.

The saleswoman immediately gasped upon hearing "buy a house near Fengyue University." Indeed, a big client. Others looked disappointed—why didn't they approach them? After the last time when a big client was overwhelmed by too many saleswomen, several were fired. So they stood quietly, not approaching. They decided to let Xiaoli treat them later.

Fengyue University was built recently but had formidable faculty, surpassing the famous XX University in Fengcheng and becoming the top university in the city. Even more impressive was its location—facing the sea, backed by mountains. Previously a tourist attraction with massive foot traffic, it now belonged to Fengyue University. Few could enter, though people were angry—no comments online. The only explanation was Fengyue University's immense background, with all negative publicity suppressed.

Housing prices soared due to the university's establishment. Few could afford it, with prices around ten million per square meter—higher than the city center. That豪林 Real Estate could build houses near Fengyue University showed their deep background.

The saleswoman was stunned. Though she sensed a big client at first, she hadn't expected her to buy nearly 200 square meters near Fengyue University—worth almost 20 million. Such large units were few, and none had sold yet.

"Madam, there's one that fits your requirements. It's 200 square meters with a rooftop garden," the saleswoman said excitedly.

"Good, no problem. Sign the contract immediately. I'll pay in full," Lin Suyun said, handing over a card.

"Please wait," the saleswoman carefully took the card. 20 million—she'd get a commission of about one million. Her excitement was palpable, but her movements slowed.

"Zhē ge, I think this house is great. It's spacious and large—so we can play freely," a tall woman said, arm around a man's. She pointed to a house.

"Okay, no problem. You'll have to take good care of me later," the man smiled at her. His height only reached her shoulder, his belly round and head bald.

The saleswoman praised briefly before returning with the contract. But she returned quickly. "Sir, Madam, sorry, this house was just sold." She pointed to Su Nantian and Lin Suyun. "How about this one? The same layout, plus a Maldives plane ticket."

The bald man was about to agree when the woman pouted. "No, Zhē ge, I want that house—close to the sea. Don't you think facing the sea is more romantic? It wasn't sold yet, right? The contract might not be signed yet?"

The tall woman swayed her arms, rubbing against the bald man's head. "Did they sign it? Is he still there? I'll talk to them," the bald man asked, feeling her softness and elasticity.

"Still haven't signed. They're still processing," the saleswoman said, pointing to Su Nantian and Lin Suyun. The bald man turned, his eyes lighting up—excellent, especially her lower half, a dream for countless men. Adding the woman's assets made it perfect.

His desire to possess surged immediately.

Chapter 50: Reencountering Wang Yanbing

"Beauty, we really have a connection. We both chose the same house," the bald man approached quickly, eyeing Lin Suyun with lust. "Let me take it for you. I'll invite you in," he said.

"Thank you, but no," Lin Suyun coldly replied. "Don't be silly. This house is expensive. You can't afford the full price. Sell it to me, and I'll let you live with me for a year—then I'll give the house to you," he said, eyes gleaming. He was certain this beauty would bite.

"Zhē ge, you promised me the house. Why change your mind now? You're giving it to this woman," the tall woman said, shaking the bald man's arm. She was jealous—this house was almost hers, and she glared at Lin Suyun with resentment.

"Xiaoqing, don't worry. You'll get yours," the bald man patted her plump rear, comforting her. If it weren't for her 36E assets, he'd have kicked her out long ago.

Lin Suyun ignored him. Talking to such a person was wasted breath. She urged, "Hurry up."

"Okay, it'll be done soon," Xiaoli's efficiency dropped.

The bald man saw he was ignored. Since he'd connected with the manager of Haolin Real Estate, his company had grown increasingly large and uncontrollable. He hadn't expected this day—no woman had ever dared ignore him before.

"Stupid woman, I've chosen you. That's your fortune. You dare ignore me?" the bald man grew angry.

"Indeed, you're being so high and mighty in front of Zhē ge," the tall woman took the chance to mock. If Zhē ge got angry, this woman was doomed. Heh, dare to compete for the house with me.

"Madam, it's ready. Sign it," Xiaoli finally finished the documents and reached out to hand them over.

"Wait, put down what you're holding," the bald man seized the opportunity. Xiaoli's hand froze mid-air, unsure whether to proceed or withdraw.

"I didn't hear you. I said put it down—specifically, give it to me. Did you understand?" the bald man shouted again, reaching for Xiaoli's contract. But his short stature and arms made it impossible to reach over the counter, despite several attempts.

Seeing his comical appearance, a few staff members chuckled and whispered. "I told you, if you don't give me the contract today, you'll be fired. I'm very close to the manager," the bald man roared. He hated being called short, and seeing them laugh, he exploded.

"Also you guys," he pointed at the ones laughing. "Don't mind him, give me the contract. He can't fire you," Lin Suyun also reached for the contract.

"Do you think you're the manager's favorite? Can you protect her? Stop pretending," the tall woman sneered. Xiaoli looked between them, unsure what to do—her hand remained in the air.

"Call over Manager Wang. I'll have him fire you, and you too," the bald man glared at the staff who laughed. Manager Wang—did he know Manager Wang? That was the general manager of Haolin Real Estate's Fengyue project.

"Dead, dead, dead," the staff immediately panicked. Xiaoli put down the contract and gave it to no one, quickly calling Manager Wang. But one staff member took the contract and handed it to the bald man.

"Now you know my power. Tigers don't show their teeth, but you thought I was a sick cat?" the bald man grinned, taking the contract with one hand and rubbing the tall woman's body with the other. "How about it? You still have time to change your mind," he said, smug.

"Hmph!" Lin Suyun sneered. "She's tough. I like that," the bald man said, loving such women—more satisfaction in conquering them.

He grew bolder and reached for Lin Suyun's ass. But the next moment, "Ah! Pain, pain—what the hell are you doing?" the bald man shouted at the man he'd ignored from the start. "Do you know who I am? I'm the boss of Tianran Decoration. If you don't let go, you'll have a hard time," the bald man gritted his teeth, gasping for breath.

"Okay," Su Nantian smiled calmly and released his grip. Clearly, the bald man's wrist was bent at 90 degrees.

The staff members covered their mouths, wide-eyed. The crowd around gasped and grew larger.
