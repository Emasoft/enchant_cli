Leng Boxiong wanted to say something but was momentarily speechless, for he realized he truly had no leverage. His son remained in Su Nantian's grasp, and all his men sent there had been annihilated. The only option left was to grit his teeth and proceed.

"How, you Su Nantian, are you just a coward who dares not accept? If you dare not accept, return my son and apologize to me. I might then pretend nothing happened."

Leng Boxiong spoke these words without any conviction, yet he knew that in the face of battle, one must not show weakness.

"I dare! But Leng Boxiong, you should know this rule is an insult to me. After I win, you will face far greater consequences! Well then, let us find an arbitrator."

Su Nantian accepted the challenge. Though Leng Boxiong had cunningly set an absurd rule, Su Nantian did not care—he would not lose.

"An arbitrator? What do we need an arbitrator for?"

Leng Boxiong said, wondering if yet another person would interfere.

Su Nantian heard the hesitation in Leng Boxiong's voice and said with a smile, "Don't worry. It's just to have an arbitrator confirm things. Considering your lack of integrity, we must set conditions. If you renege during this challenge, the arbitrator will confirm and transfer all shares of Tiha Group to me."

"Su Nantian, you're dreaming! You've gone to such lengths for my Tiha Group shares! I won't agree!"

Leng Boxiong would never accept. He had finally found a method where he had the greatest chance of victory, but now Su Nantian had turned the tables on him.

Standing nearby, Qi Yinzhen furrowed his brow after hearing their phone conversation. This Su Nantian truly was no ordinary man, more resourceful than he had anticipated. He must not underestimate him.

Su Nantian knew Leng Boxiong would refuse. He toyed with his cup, took a sip of wine, and said, "You can refuse. But I can also deal with Leng Zhifei at will. Then I'll hang up."

After saying this, Su Nantian prepared to press the disconnect button. But a frantic voice on the other end of the line cried, "Don't hang up! I agree! Go find an arbitrator!"

"Good. Then let's proceed as before," Su Nantian said calmly and hung up.

Su Nantian and Leng Boxiong met at a warehouse on the outskirts of Hangcheng. This was where Tiha Group stored goods, rarely visited and spacious enough for both sides to fight.

Leng Boxiong and Qi Yinzhen stood on the open square waiting, with several bodyguards behind them. The main members of Dark刺 had not arrived yet; today was not the final challenge.

They were here merely to meet the arbitrator and sign the agreement. Additionally, per Qi Yinzhen's request, they wanted to meet Su Nantian in person to assess his strength.

As Leng Boxiong grew impatient, a black car approached the square. The vehicle appeared modest but anyone with knowledge would recognize its high cost—its advanced protective systems made it unattainable for ordinary people.

The door opened, and Su Nantian stepped out first. His gaze swept over Qi Yinzhen behind Leng Boxiong, already forming an idea—this man was likely one of Leng Boxiong's allies.

"Su Nantian, where is your witness? You're alone," Leng Boxiong said, observing Su Nantian's single arrival.

"Don't worry. The witness is inside the car."

Su Nantian nodded to the car, and a middle-aged man stepped out. Dressed impeccably, he carried a cane and walked with a limp, appearing inconvenient but exuding an aura that commanded respect.

Su Nantian introduced the man to Leng Boxiong, saying, "Mr. Song Licen, head of the Beijing branch of the Song family. He's here in Hangcheng for business. I've boldly asked him to be the witness—this is giving you face."

The Song family was another with deep roots and power, holding a place in Beijing itself. Their influence was immense. And this man was no ordinary figure—he commanded a branch, his status evident.

Even Leng Boxiong, despite his ignorance, had heard of the Song family. These elite families were a mandatory subject for him, memorized thoroughly. He had longed to connect with their members, hoping to rise from obscurity.

Yet Leng Boxiong never expected to meet a Song family member under these circumstances.

"Ah…," Leng Boxiong's forehead broke out in cold sweat. Su Nantian was truly a wolf in sheep's clothing—only someone connected to the Song family could have such influence. If he had known earlier, how could he have offended Su Nantian?

"Mr. Leng, don't worry. I'm here only as an arbitrator. I guarantee fairness and impartiality on behalf of the Song family," Song Licen smiled, having seen this look countless times—pure reverence for the Song family.

Chapter 387: Wheel Battle

After confirming the terms were unobjectionable, both parties handed them to Song Licen. He didn't even glance at them before signing his name in the arbitrator's column.

After replacing the contract, Leng Boxiong glanced at it before handing it to his female secretary. He took a deep breath and left.

"Hey, Mr. Leng, don't forget to meet tomorrow!" Su Nantian shouted after Leng Boxiong's back, fearing he might forget.

Leng Boxiong paused but said nothing, leaving the café angrily.

"Hah… you really are a pain!" Song Licen stood up, glanced around, and chuckled as he sat back down. "It's all out of necessity. I believe you."

"I don't trust you, but let's go eat first. We'll check the venue for the duel later," Song Licen mocked, standing up to beckon Su Nantian.

Lingyun Manor stood on a mountain in Hangcheng's outskirts. In a city where land was at a premium, Lingyun Manor occupied an entire mountain—its grandeur evident. This was where Su Nantian and Leng Boxiong would duel.

At around 7 PM, a sports car parked at the mansion's entrance. Song Licen asked a security guard to park it, while Su Nantian observed Lingyun Manor carefully.

In the hazy night, a massive palace complex stood on the mountain's slope. The outer walls were built with red bricks, while the inner courtyard was an expanded version of a Suzhou-style garden. Every carved detail and balustrade exuded ancient charm. If it weren't for the orange neon lights flickering nearby, Su Nantian might have felt transported to an imperial palace.

"Truly a grand gesture!" Su Nantian marveled at the perimeter, prompting Song Licen's laughter. He stepped inside.

Song Licen introduced Lingyun Manor to Su Nantian: "There's no closing time here. As a member, even if you arrive at midnight, someone will be waiting to serve you."

Walking along stone-paved paths, Su Nantian entered the courtyard. The yard was roughly the size of a football field, with various luxury cars parked around—Lamborghinis and Porsches were standard, while Bugattis and Rolls-Royces were common sights.

Though the courtyard was empty, Su Nantian sensed at least dozens of security personnel hidden in the shadows. They remained concealed until any incident occurred, then rushed out to resolve it.

He glanced at the luxury cars before following Song Licen into the hall. The interior decor maintained an ancient style, with modern equipment cleverly hidden within decorations—hard to notice at first glance. This ensured both aesthetics and comfort.

As they entered, two women in pale blue peony qipao approached. Song Licen, a member of the elite, was naturally welcomed here. Upon his arrival, a butler would serve him.

"See? The highest treatment. As a member, the manor automatically assigns a butler to handle all your affairs!" Song Licen raised an eyebrow, teasingly remarked.

"Good evening. Are you Mr. Su Nantian? Please confirm your title," the woman performed a traditional bow, speaking sweetly.

Su Nantian looked at Song Licen with an odd expression.

Song Licen smiled, "I arranged this for you. When you have time later, come play. This title is a special service—members pay a fee and choose a name, and the butler will address you with that title during service. As long as you pay, it can be any name. How's that?"

Su Nantian chuckled, "Rich people are really任性."

Song Licen waved to another qipao woman. She swayed her hips, approached with a slight bow, and said sweetly, "Master Chen…"

"Enough. Go about your duties!"

Hearing the honeyed voice, Song Licen waved dismissively and sent the woman away, urging Su Nantian to choose a title.

Su Nantian observed her flawless face and nodded slightly, as if considering an amusing name. She remained calm, displaying perfect professional conduct without any signs of unease.

"Ah… I don't need a title. Just call me Mr. Su."

Su Nantian finally said, disappointing Song Licen. He patted Su Nantian's shoulder and teased, "You really are no fun at all. Are you shy?"

Su Nantian shook his head, ignoring Song Licen's jibe and asked the qipao woman, "Any introduction?"

"Hey, you've got a beauty but forget your brother. You two chat while I take a walk!"

Song Licen grumbled, walking towards a corridor. Su Nantian shrugged and signaled the woman to continue her introduction.

"Good, Mr. Su. Welcome for your first visit. It's currently 7 PM. You may freely use all services, including Chinese and Western dinners, fitness facilities, and saunas…"

Seeing Su Nantian had no title set, the woman secretly sighed in relief.

"How should I address you? What's your contact information?" Su Nantian didn't rush to use any service but asked the woman.

The woman performed another traditional bow, saying, "My name is Shen Ziyu. You may call me Xiaoyu. As for my contact information, it's already sent to your phone. You may contact Xiaoyu anytime and use any service at Lingyun Manor."

Su Nantian took out his phone. His email received a message, which he opened to find Shen Ziyu's complete profile.

Shen Ziyu, a native of Hangcheng. Her parents died when she was young. She joined Lingyun Manor at age eleven, becoming a service staff. Graduated from the Royal Butler Academy abroad. Skilled in music, chess, calligraphy, and painting. Familiar with ancient Chinese etiquette and modern European customs. Possesses aesthetic sensibilities and coordination abilities, suitable for a butler position.

Her career history: before Su Nantian, Shen Ziyu had served two members—both female. Su Nantian was her first male member.

"Xiaoyu, I don't have any particular preferences. You needn't perform bows constantly. However, one thing: you must not disclose my information to outsiders. That's a butler's professional ethics, right?"

Su Nantian put his phone away and said to Shen Ziyu. This beauty was at least an 8 out of 10, and with the qipao uniform's enhancement, she was at least an 8.5. Having such a beauty as his butler, even with Song Licen's guarantee, Su Nantian remained cautious.

Chapter 388: Certain Victory

"South Tian, I must congratulate you beforehand. Now you've added another group to your collection. Tiha Group holds significant power in Hangcheng. If you gain this group, you'll be one of the top figures here. Naturally, you're already a top figure."

Song Licen sat in the car and said with a smile.

Song Licen's relationship with Su Nantian was indeed good. Since the Song family had members in the Dragon Group, he naturally knew Su Nantian's strength. The Song family was well-known for making friends widely, using this connection to befriend Su Nantian.

Moreover, Song Licen wasn't very old—around thirty-something. His mind was still youthful, so he and Su Nantian shared similar interests.

This time Su Nantian had managed to get Song Licen as an arbitrator was coincidental. Coincidentally, Song Licen had come to Hangcheng for business negotiations, and Su Nantian happened to catch him.

"I know my interest in business isn't great. If I were locked into a group, it would be counterproductive for me. This time, I plan to hand Tiha Group over to Wen Ran."

Su Nantian didn't hide his small thoughts before Song Licen. A gentleman would be swayed by a beauty, and this wasn't shameful.

Song Licen's fingers tapped on his cane as he said, "Wen Ran? Does that mean Wen Hai's daughter?"

"Did you know about Wen Hai?" Su Nantian was surprised. In Hangcheng's power circles, the Wen family was better than small clans but hadn't reached a level where the Song family would notice.

Song Licen smiled and said, "Since I'm here for business, naturally I pay attention to Hangcheng's dynamics. Moreover, the woman Su Nantian would choose wouldn't be an unknown. The only well-known Wen family in Hangcheng is one, so I guessed."

Song Licen was indeed known for his sharp mind. Otherwise, he wouldn't have reached the position of managing a branch. These major families not only valued talent but also personal image. People like Song Licen, who had a slight physical disability, needed to be strong enough to reach this position.

"Respectful respect. You truly are the Song President, exceptional indeed," Su Nantian smiled and clapped.

"Stop it. How could you compare to me? Now you're effortlessly taking Tiha Group into your collection. You've truly outwitted Leng Boxiong, leaving him with no group at all."

Song Licen laughed. Su Nantian was indeed ruthless. Tiha Group was Leng Boxiong's only hope, as the company's shares were entirely controlled by him. It was a family business.

But shareholding companies had many benefits and preferences, so they chose this model. For years, shareholder meetings and board of directors were mere formalities; Leng Boxiong was the sole ruler.

"Hey, you know my temperament. If he hadn't constantly provoked and insulted me, it wouldn't have come to this," Su Nantian casually adjusted his nose. This wasn't his fault.

"Seems you really should thank Leng Boxiong's son. Giving you a group is truly good fortune, hahaha."

Su Nantian and Song Licen laughed freely in the car. They both knew that the result of the duel three days later was already decided—Su Nantian would definitely win.

After returning, Su Nantian didn't need to prepare anything. He still had Wen Ran by his side, and they spent their leisure time watching TV shows.

Su Nantian didn't like these things much, but Wen Ran did. He naturally accompanied her.

While they were watching intently, Wen Ran's phone rang.

"It's... my father," Wen Ran saw the words "Wen Hai" on the phone. She was a bit doubtful, wondering what her father wanted at this time.

Su Nantian didn't care. He ate a grape and said, "Answer it and hear what Wen Hai has to say. It's probably about Leng Boxiong."

"Hello, Dad, what do you need?" Wen Ran answered the call.

"You're still with Su Nantian?" Wen Hai said, but his tone wasn't good.

Wen Ran nodded. "Yes."

"Didn't I tell you to be smart? Leng Boxiong has already challenged Su Nantian. Five matches, and if Su Nantian loses once, he'll lose everything. And this is a wheel battle—Su Nantian will definitely lose. Why are you still with him? That's seeking death! Come home now, I'll beg Leng Boxiong to let you marry Leng Zhifei again. Your life might still become a rich lady!"

Wen Hai ranted on the phone, but Su Nantian heard everything.

Before Wen Ran could speak, Su Nantian suddenly sat up and took the phone, saying coldly, "Wen Hai, you're really two-faced. Didn't you previously ask me to help your people? You don't need to hope I lose. Let me tell you, this time I will win. Wen Ran won't be a rich lady of the Cold family. If you want to play, do it yourself by running a company!"

After saying this, Su Nantian hung up. Wen Hai's two-faced behavior truly disgusted him.

Previously, Su Nantian had been polite to Wen Hai out of respect for Wen Ran. But now that Wen Hai said this, Su Nantian could no longer be polite.

"South Tian, how did your father say that Leng Boxiong is doing a wheel battle? One person after another in one day. Can you keep up with the stamina? I'm really worried," Wen Ran said, looking very concerned and hugging Su Nantian's arm.

"Ran, don't worry. I dared to go, so I'll definitely win. I told you I'd win Tiha Group back for you. Don't worry. Do you still not trust me? My woman won't be a rich lady of the Cold family. If you want to play, do it yourself by running a company!"

"Okay, I trust you. I know you'll definitely win. But I still have to say that you must be careful and not get hurt. I'm waiting for your victory at home."

Wen Ran said this while hugging Su Nantian's arm tighter. Su Nantian nodded gently, naturally confident of his victory.

Chapter 389: Death Contract

Three days passed in the blink of an eye. Su Nantian didn't make any special arrangements or prepare with urgency. He had complete confidence in his skills.

Moreover, although he hadn't seen all his opponents' appearances, he had already met Qi Yinzhen. He could infer that Qi Yinzhen was among the higher-level ones.

Indeed, in the Dark刺 organization, as the leader, Qi Yinzhen's skills were naturally high. But he wasn't the strongest.

However, Su Nantian could use his impression of Qi Yinzhen to estimate the level of those he would face. He was certain that members of the Dark刺 organization weren't his opponents.

But since the Dark刺 had been hired by Leng Boxiong, they proved their strength. Still, no matter how strong they were, they couldn't escape Su Nantian's five fingers.

After receiving Wen Ran's repeated instructions, Su Nantian followed Song Licen to the warehouse in Hangcheng's suburbs.

"How are you preparing?" Song Licen, as usual, expressed his concern. He knew Su Nantian would definitely win but still made small talk.

"Nothing much, but it's fine," Su Nantian smiled confidently.

The car took the small road into Tiha Group's warehouse area in the suburbs. This time was quite different from before; when Su Nantian and Leng Boxiong met here, there weren't many people. Now, however, they saw a row of men in black suits standing on both sides of the road, looking quite imposing.

"Showing off. It's to boost their own courage," Su Nantian looked at the setup on both sides of the car window and smiled disdainfully.

Leng Boxiong was playing this game.

As Su Nantian and Song Licen stepped out, they saw Leng Boxiong already waiting on the square. Scanning over them, there were five men behind Leng Boxiong—among them was Qi Yinzhen.

"Hey, everyone's here. Good. Shall we start now or do you have anything else to say?" Su Nantian showed no fear, watching them like a spectator.

"You're really overstepping! Don't be so arrogant now, or you'll regret it!" One of them, after hearing Su Nantian's words, was angry and pointed at Su Nantian.

Qi Yinzhen quickly patted his shoulder and said, "Su La, don't be impulsive. This Su Nantian's style is like this—completely arrogant and self-important. He just wants to provoke you with these words, interfering with your judgment. If during the match you still get angry because of his words, it will interfere with your judgment and attack."

"You're quite the expert! You analyzed this so well. But I tell you, I Su Nantian don't play that game! Calling you is calling you, not doing anything else!"

After saying this, Su Nantian waved his hand. He truly hadn't said so much before. This Qi Yinzhen had completely misunderstood.

"Enough, no more talking. Since you're here, let's start. I've already had the warehouse prepared; the arena is inside."

After saying this, Leng Boxiong led these five men towards the warehouse beside them.

"Warehouse? Let's check what it is," Su Nantian said and followed with Song Licen.

After entering the warehouse, it was indeed a different world. Su Nantian had initially thought they would fight on the small square outside, but this Leng Boxiong had built an arena inside.

This arena was built quite formally, similar in scale to a boxing match but much larger.

"Ah, really expensive. You even built an arena specifically. It's good, I'm happy," Su Nantian clapped his hands.

Leng Boxiong was used to seeing Su Nantian's attitude and ignored it, then said, "If there are no problems, we'll start. Mr. Song, you as the arbitrator should sit here."

When he said this, Leng Boxiong's attitude turned 180 degrees. He smiled at Song Licen and even helped him move a chair.

Song Licen smiled and walked over. The view here was good, directly facing the center of the arena, allowing a clear view of everything happening on it.

Song Licen nodded in satisfaction and waved to his bodyguards behind him. They immediately opened the file bag and took out the challenge agreement signed by Su Nantian and Leng Boxiong.

"Alright, since we're about to start, let's talk again. This is the challenge document you two signed. Mr. Leng, have you prepared the share transfer agreement?"

Leng Boxiong immediately took out five contracts and said, "Five contracts, none missing. Each is twenty percent of Tiha Group's shares."

"Good, we can start now. The sooner the better, then I'll prepare to take over Tiha Group," Su Nantian said while rubbing his wrists, as if doing a warm-up.

"Su Nantian, I have one more thing. Do you dare to sign a death contract?" At this moment, Qi Yinzhen stepped forward and held out a paper with the three big characters "Death Contract" on it.

"Ah, you wanted to gamble your life?" Su Nantian smiled disdainfully. What a nonsense death contract, meaningless to him.

"Ask you if you dare or not? After signing the death contract, life and death are your own. If you die, don't blame the other party. Just take responsibility yourself. Since Mr. Song is here, let's have him witness it again."

"Sure, sign it. Then I won't hold back," Su Nantian said and walked towards Qi Yinzhen, writing his name on the death contract.

Then Su Nantian jumped onto the arena and waved at the five men of Dark刺, saying, "Alright, wheel battle? Who's first to come up and fight with me!"

"I will!" One of the five men immediately jumped onto the arena.

Su Nantian looked closely. This was the one who had previously told him to move aside.

"Ah, it's you. Alright, you're first. Let you come up and accept the punishment of fate!"

Chapter 390: One Punch to Kill

At this moment, Su Nantian and Su La stood on the arena. Su Nantian had already given Su La a spiritual洗礼 with his words.

As Su La turned red-faced and prepared to retaliate, Qi Yinzhen shouted from the arena below: "I told you not to care about what he said! That's to interfere with your judgment! Remember what I told you. Start now!"

Although Qi Yinzhen hadn't seen Su Nantian's actual skills, he had heard many stories about Su Nantian in Hangcheng. One person fighting dozens of people was most famous, so Qi Yinzhen didn't dare to underestimate him. He also knew it would be difficult to find someone stronger than Su Nantian in Dark刺.

Therefore, Qi Yinzhen used this wheel battle rule. Since Su Nantian had boasted he could accept a tight wheel battle, it was advantageous for Qi Yinzhen and his team.

Among the top five fighters of Dark刺 led by Qi Yinzhen, Su La's ability was the weakest. So Qi Yinzhen arranged for Su La to be the first to fight with Su Nantian. Moreover, Qi Yinzhen had clearly stated that the first three people's task was not to defeat Su Nantian but to drain his energy, fight with him and attack simultaneously. Ideally, they would exhaust Su Nantian's stamina while also injuring him so that when Qi Yinzhen and Qi Ye'wei stepped in, they had a high probability of defeating Su Nantian.

Indeed, the strongest in Dark刺 was Qi Ye'wei. However, Qi Ye'wei had immense strength but his combat skills were the best. He couldn't command the organization, so although Qi Yinzhen ranked second in combat skills, because of his flexible mind and ability to manage Dark刺 well, he was now the top position.

Su La respected Qi Yinzhen deeply. After hearing Qi Yinzhen's words, he suppressed his anger and knew he couldn't fall into Su Nantian's trap. He had to do what he was supposed to.

But now, Su La doubted—this kid looked so carefree. Could he really have defeated dozens of people alone? Maybe he could defeat this Su Nantian with one move. Then he would have achieved great success.

"Enough, don't play tricks anymore. Just start fighting!" Su Nantian watched Qi Yinzhen directing from below, and this Su La was thinking about tactics on the stage. He was impatient; he had come here to finish it quickly.

Five matches, cutting through like a knife. He would immediately knock them down and then take over Tiha Group's shares legitimately.

Su Nantian gave a glance to Song Licen sitting below. This wasn't that Su Nantian and Song Licen were planning something, but Su Nantian wanted Song Licen to announce the start of the match immediately. He was really annoyed by Qi Yinzhen and Su La.

After receiving Su Nantian's glance, Song Licen understood. He was also eager to see this match. After all, he had been dealing with various matters in the business world for a long time and rarely had such relaxed moments.

"Alright, let's start!" Song Licen immediately shouted.

Song Licen spoke, and Su La immediately entered a combat stance. He positioned himself to attack carefully, constantly circling around looking for an opportunity.

But Su La was confused. He had expected Su Nantian to adopt a defensive stance, but now Su Nantian stood there carelessly with obvious flaws. This was too strange and seemed like a rookie who didn't know how to attack or defend.

"Is this a trick to lure me into?" Su La continued searching for opportunities while speaking.

But Su Nantian remained in the same position. As Su La circled, Su Nantian followed.

"You're done? Are you coming here to circle around? Do you want to go home and play with your mother?" Su Nantian was finally impatient. If he wanted to fight, just fight. Circling around was really annoying.

"Stand here! Come and attack!" Su Nantian said, crossing his arms and standing still, waiting for Su La's attack.

"Haha, maybe I overthought it. This kid's arrogance is really annoying. I'll teach him a lesson!"

Thinking this, Su La immediately moved and rushed towards Su Nantian.

He was attacking but hadn't forgotten Qi Yinzhen's instructions to drain Su Nantian's stamina. So if he rushed forward and attacked Su Nantian directly, even if Su Nantian avoided it, his speed would allow him to escape. Then he could constantly harass Su Nantian with this speed.

Indeed, Su La's greatest strength was his speed. He was much faster than ordinary people. That's why Qi Yinzhen used this to have Su La be the first to harass Su Nantian and greatly drain his stamina.

Although this would also exhaust Su La's energy, it didn't matter. They had four more people; they were in a wheel battle.

"Finally!" Su Nantian smiled coldly and immediately swung his fist with lightning speed.

"Boom!"

Su La fell directly onto the arena, Su Nantian's fist hitting his nose. Blood gushed out.

One punch. Yes, Su Nantian had only used one punch to immediately defeat the fast-moving Su La.

"He's still alive, breathing. Don't worry, come and carry him away," Su Nantian crouched down to check Su La's breath. He still had a pulse, so he had indeed held back.

"Killing is illegal. You think I'm stupid? The police don't care about the death contract," Su Nantian said while standing back at his original position.

Su Nantian had truly been annoyed by Su La. He was so slow and uncool, thinking too much all the time. So Su Nantian chose this way to end the match.

Since Su La liked to be roundabout, he would just use a straight punch to end it.

Moreover, Su La's speed might seem dazzling to ordinary people but was too slow for Su Nantian. He could accurately punch his nose.

Chapter 391: Circles

Su Nantian's performance left everyone present in awe. The only one who seemed relatively normal was Song Licen.

Song family had members in the Dragon Group, so Song Licen had long heard of Su Nantian's strength. Not just here, but in the Dragon Group, finding someone stronger than Su Nantian would be hard.

But Song Licen was still surprised. This immense power deserved his amazement.

Leng Boxiong's face had turned a deep red. He was both angry and afraid. This Su Nantian was so strong, defeating the fifth-ranked Dark刺 expert in one punch and even leaving him unconscious. This person was truly a monster.

Leng Boxiong's men immediately rushed onto the arena, quickly carried Su La on a stretcher and left without hesitation. They feared staying longer would also be knocked down by Su Nantian.

"Master Qi, what's going on? You previously assured me you could win! Now we've already lost twenty percent of Tiha Group's shares!"

Leng Boxiong angrily slammed the table and said.

Actually, Qi Yinzhen was also stunned but still had to speak: "Mr. Leng, don't be angry. This is only the first match. I admit my previous estimation was slightly wrong, but now that we've seen Su Nantian's actual skills, it will be easier for us later. Knowing each other is the key to winning battles. We only heard about Su Nantian's strength before, but we hadn't seen it. Moreover, if he loses one match, all the shares are still yours."

After hearing this, Leng Boxiong felt a bit reassured. After all, it was only the first match; there was still hope.

"Mr. Leng, where is the share transfer document? Hurry up and give it to Mr. Song!" Su Nantian leisurely leaned on the arena railing, waving at Leng Boxiong below.
