Su Nantian picked up the third vine from the ground, tightly binding Ada to his body. He only felt at ease when he confirmed that even at high speeds, Ada would not fall off.

Su Nantian took the two vines from Ada’s hands. Though they had been limp and lifeless, in Su Nantian’s grip, they transformed into two sturdy iron rods.

The middle-aged guard watched intently, but the impact was equally staggering. He gazed at the two blades above, which shimmered with a faint white light—sharpness so profound it left him awestruck.

Only now did he realize that if this man had intended to kill him, one move alone would have been enough to leave him dead beyond recognition. He had never even gotten a chance to act.

This thought stirred a wave of disappointment within him. He had trained all his life, yet this youth surpassed him effortlessly.

He gazed at the young man’s back, feeling as though a mountain stood before him—vast and insurmountable. Suddenly, his expression shifted.

He saw Su Nantian leap into the air as if flying, vines in hand repeatedly piercing the rock wall. His movements were agile and swift, ignoring the sheer precipice that made even seasoned climbers tremble.

The cliff itself had become a place for brief respite.

The middle-aged guard’s mind reeled. He could not accept this truth—after all, even the Grand Elder had failed to traverse this path so effortlessly.

If his sect sought revenge against this youth, it would face annihilation. The Windfall Sect might vanish overnight.

Suddenly, he recalled the young master. She had already sent him to return and report to the sect. Thinking of her capricious, vindictive nature, he feared what the sect might do.

He needed to return swiftly and inform them—this youth was no one they could challenge.

He assessed the direction, then sprinted away. He had to return before the young master did; only then might he prevent them from acting.

At that moment, Ada felt as though he were flying through the air—utterly free. This sensation was foreign to him, yet he longed for it deeply.

He also felt profound gratitude toward Su Nantian for not killing him and teaching him. Though the man often seemed cold, his heart was kind.

Gradually, Ada fell into a deep sleep on Su Nantian’s back, comforted by the steady rhythm of his breath. A faint smile tugged at Su Nantian’s lips.

As Su Nantian repeatedly shook his arms, the two moved swiftly forward. The reason he had crafted these vines was to conserve spiritual energy. By channeling his energy into the vines, he could save both energy and strength while preserving his vitality for potential ambushes.

Meanwhile, He Wei pressed forward with equal determination. Unlike the Grand Elder, he was not at that level, so he did not take Su Nantian’s path. To do so would be tantamount to suicide. Though he had longed to explore the mysteries of that path, which even the Grand Elder coveted, his first priority was becoming the Grand Elder. If he could return with this child, the credit would be his alone—his ascension to Grand Elder was imminent.

To avoid conventional routes while moving swiftly, He Wei devised an ingenious path: the water route. Though slower due to its upstream nature, it was entirely safe—no one had ever traversed it. This route had been his secret escape plan for years, and now it proved invaluable.

The journey had yielded no signs of pursuit; it was an ideal path. He also wondered why the master placed such importance on this child. After thoroughly inspecting him, he found no abnormalities—just an ordinary child with no signs of cultivation talent. He could not fathom what made this child special, but he abandoned his doubts; completing the mission would grant him what he desired.

Chapter 944: Kuang Qingya

With this thought, he felt at ease. This place posed no risk of the child escaping, and he could monitor for pursuers. After all, he had a second plan.

As dusk approached, Su Nantian’s long afternoon journey left him weary. At this pace, he might reach his destination by tomorrow—satisfactory progress.

This thought gave him hope of intercepting the other before he returned to Heifeng Cliff. Suddenly, he spotted a flicker of firelight ahead on the cliff wall—only to see it extinguish swiftly.

Su Nantian’s lips curled into a smile. The opponent must have sensed him and quickly snuffed out the light. Yet, with nightfall approaching, he could not press on further. He lunged forward and landed firmly at the cave’s entrance.

“Excuse me, I’m sorry to bother you all. I’d like to stay here tonight.” Su Nantian stood at the cave’s entrance, speaking calmly. But after a long silence, no one responded.

He then pulled out a section of vine and lit it as a makeshift torch, advancing into the cave’s depths. The pitch-black entrance was illuminated by the fire’s glow, as if standing within a beast’s maw. Yet Su Nantian remained undaunted. Though he had lost his memories, he had never known fear.

After walking about fifteen steps, a flash of silver light streaked through the darkness toward him. Su Nantian narrowed his eyes, shifting slightly. The projectile grazed his cheek and embedded itself into the cliff wall behind him, leaving a deep crater.

“Your aim is strong, but your precision lacks.” Su Nantian smiled. “I mean no harm—just a little sponsorship.”

A moment of silence passed before the firelight flickered again. The extinguished fire was relit by two figures ahead.

Su Nantian saw a young woman and middle-aged man watching him with wary eyes. Though he did not understand their expressions, he dismissed it as irrelevant and moved to a spot slightly away from them.

He placed the sleeping Ada down, gazing at his peaceful face with an unfamiliar feeling—fleeting, even he did not notice it.

Su Nantian bowed to the pair, a greeting, then produced extra vines, building a fire beside Ada. He retrieved some dried provisions from his robes and carefully roasted them.

The two watched Su Nantian, speculating endlessly about his identity but finding no clues. A youth so young carrying a child on this cliff—impossible for even the middle-aged man to achieve. Though he too had a companion, carrying her fully was impossible; he might not even ensure his own safety.

He subtly sensed Su Nantian’s aura—ordinary, like that of an ordinary person. Yet how could such a man appear here? This made him wary, suspecting the youth’s intentions might align with theirs.

If so, they would become rivals.

Though the woman was astonished, she marveled at Su Nantian’s striking appearance—far superior to the “crooked melons” of her sect. Glancing at the rough dried provisions in her hand and then at Su Nantian’s fresh roasted meat, she felt a pang of envy.

The middle-aged man pondered for a long time but found no clues. Finally, he asked, “I am Kuang Long. This is my daughter, Qingya. From the Eternal Green Sect. May I inquire your name and lineage?”

“I don’t know where I’m from,” Su Nantian mused. “If you recognize me, please inform me.” He spoke earnestly. “I am Su Nantian. That is all I remember—everything else has faded.”

Kuang Long’s vigilance deepened. The man’s demeanor suggested no deception, yet he clearly withheld information. However, when the opponent heard “Eternal Green Sect,” he seemed unfamiliar—likely an outsider.

At that moment, Kuang Qingya’s eyes were fixed on Su Nantian’s roasted meat, her mouth watering. The cave was narrow, and the aroma of roast meat lingered in the air.

Kuang Long glanced at his daughter, exasperated. “What a shame—just a piece of meat and you’re already so entranced.”

Kuang Long coughed, reminding her. The girl seemed deaf, leaning awkwardly. Finally, he gently tapped her forehead.

Kuang Qingya jolted awake, casting a resentful glance at her father before biting into the coarse bun. Her eyes occasionally flicked toward Su Nantian’s roast meat.

Kuang Long sighed helplessly. His daughter was insatiable; this journey had been to train her, yet a single roast meat had reduced her to such a state. If she were alone, he would never trust her.

“Forgive me, young man. Do you have any extra provisions? We could exchange.” Kuang Long awkwardly held up his dried food.

Su Nantian smiled and readily agreed, tossing the roast meat into the air. Kuang Qingya’s eyes locked onto it, her hands reaching out to grasp it—only to hear Su Nantian’s voice: “Beware, it’s hot. Rushing won’t get you the tofu.”

Though Su Nantian meant well, Kuang Qingya’s face flared red. She cursed him silently in her mind.

She carefully placed the meat back on the fire, eyes fixed on it—no longer glancing at Su Nantian. Though he was handsome, the roast meat outweighed him. After all, looking couldn’t fill her stomach; only this warmth could.

Kuang Long was surprised by his daughter’s shy demeanor. Normally, she acted like a tomboy, even making him question if she were truly a girl. Yet now, she blushed—Kuang Long’s first time witnessing it. If his wife knew, she’d be overjoyed. She often complained that he had raised their daughter as a boy, making it hard to change now.

Chapter 945: The Chosen Seed

At this moment, Kuang Long’s heart was actually quite happy. He hadn’t expected his daughter to still retain her feminine nature, blushing over such a trivial matter. If it were known, it would surely be amusing.

Kuang Long mused for a moment before finding the thought humorous.

Then he turned his gaze to Su Nantian, who was indeed handsome and had reached this cliff—his strength must be formidable. If he were unmarried and of clear lineage, becoming a son-in-law would be ideal.

If Kuang Long knew this thought, Su Nantian would have immediately fled with Ada. These people’s ideas were too strange—calling someone a son-in-law without hesitation.

Su Nantian held the roast meat, watching it nearly cook through. He placed it near Ada’s face, gently blowing to cool it. The rich aroma of roast meat stimulated Ada’s taste buds.

Ada mumbled drowsily, “Meat… sister, eat meat.”

His eyes welled with tears. Su Nantian was stunned; this child’s background must be tragic. He still knew he had family, though they might have left him—but he didn’t even know who he was.

A sense of kinship stirred within Su Nantian, further solidifying his resolve to recover his memories. Without them, he felt like a rootless drifting leaf—adrift wherever fate led.

Su Nantian wiped the tears from Ada’s eyes with his sleeve, then placed the roast meat back on the fire. Gazing at the flames, he felt a rare loneliness.

Kuang Long observed Su Nantian thoughtfully. Suddenly, he recalled something—this outsider might have come for the Chosen Seed.

If so, it made sense. The Chosen Seed was a grand ceremony held every ten years. The final victor would be chosen by the Divine Envoy to ascend to the divine realm—a coveted opportunity that drew many. Each participant was a prodigy from various factions, even rivaling the elite of the Four Imperial Clans. Though most victors hailed from these clans, a few outsiders also secured spots.

After much deliberation, Kuang Long finally spoke: “Young man, your journey to this mountain—where are you headed?”

Su Nantian lifted his gaze, locking eyes with Kuang Long without speaking. Their mutual stare seemed to spark a fire.

Kuang Long was taken aback by Su Nantian’s vigilance. He quickly waved his hands, “If you don’t wish to reveal it, I won’t press further. No harm intended—just hoping to assist.”

Kuang Long added, “We plan to continue upward tomorrow.” To recruit him, he had to offer something without revealing his intent.

“Oh, what’s there on this mountain that you’re climbing?” Su Nantian asked curiously. He hadn’t noticed anything special along his path—just steep cliffs.

“Ah, young man hasn’t noticed anything unusual?” Kuang Long chuckled. “At the summit of this mountain lies a Divine Emperor Temple, with nine levels. The ninth is said to grant one wish—though no one has ever entered it, not even the third level.”

Kuang Long revealed this without hesitation, as it wasn’t a secret. Once past the Falling Dew Mountains, one would quickly learn of this legend—a hidden treasure opening every century.

Yet few had the ability to reach here. This youth’s ignorance surprised Kuang Long.

“Can it help me recover my memories?” Su Nantian asked, sensing something was amiss.

“Recovering your memory? That’s trivial. But you must enter the ninth level, or find a relic to reclaim yourself before then.” Kuang Long spoke meaningfully. He doubted this boy could even reach the third level.

“How long until the summit?” Su Nantian asked, intrigued. If there was a way to recover his memories, he’d try it.

“Approximately 2000 meters ahead. The colder it gets, the harder the climb—about two days. I have some clothes to give you.” Kuang Long said calmly, having successfully piqued Su Nantian’s interest.

Su Nantian calculated in his mind—2000 meters was no problem for him. A round trip would take half a day. Though the cold was harsh, he seemed insensitive to it, as if naturally resistant to nature’s elements.

If they climbed together, it would slow them down—but half a day was enough.

Yet he suddenly thought of Xiao Wang. If this caused his death, he’d regret it forever.

“Seems you’re quite interested,” Kuang Long continued. “This is a once-in-a-century opportunity. If you miss it, you’ll have to wait another century.”

Su Nantian’s interest was genuine, but he needed an exact time. “I need to know how far Blackwind Cliff is.”

“Going there would take another 3000 meters—about two days. It’s dangerous, as bandits often lurk there. Even more, it has a mysterious master.” Kuang Long said calmly. He was curious why this youth went to Blackwind Cliff.

Su Nantian’s eyes lit up—only 3000 meters left! This surprised him. For him, it was effortless; he could reach it in the morning.

Chapter 946: The Decision

As Su Nantian hesitated, Kuang Long spoke again. “Young man, if your matter is urgent, I have a two-pronged plan.”

Kuang Long thought for a moment before speaking, fearing Su Nantian would refuse. If this youth joined them, their chances of success would rise significantly.

Su Nantian’s brows slightly lifted. “What is this two-pronged plan? Please explain.”

“If your matter isn’t too urgent, after we reach the summit and complete the nine levels of the pagoda, there’s a teleportation array in the first level. Paying the price allows instant travel to your destination.” Kuang Long smiled, his tone filled with admiration for the array.

This revelation would astonish outsiders—yet Su Nantian showed no reaction, remaining calm as if it were ordinary.

Teleportation array,” Su Nantian murmured, a faint memory stirring but eluding him. This deepened his resolve to ascend and see it for himself.

“Then so be it. We’ll depart at dawn.” Su Nantian decided, readily accepting Kuang Long’s proposal.

Thinking of the morning journey ahead, Su Nantian sat cross-legged to recover his energy and replenish his spiritual energy. The high altitude made the spiritual energy here noticeably denser, even more pleasant to absorb.

He suspected the spiritual energy concentrated above—closer to the ground, it thinned. This thought was natural.

If the spiritual energy grew denser as he climbed, his hypothesis would likely be correct.

Kuang Long was unaware of Su Nantian’s thoughts, but when he sensed Su Nantian’s calm breath, he was stunned.

To them, this state was meditation—extremely difficult, requiring high talent and deep cultivation. Few could achieve such effortless meditation.

This state allowed rapid cultivation; those who mastered it were exceptional talents. Even he had only achieved it a few times in his life.

He gazed at Su Nantian, more puzzled than before. He questioned whether accompanying this youth was wise—but all relied on absolute power. He still had confidence in defeating Su Nantian.

No words were exchanged that night.

At dawn, Su Nantian opened his eyes, exhaling deeply to feel the abundant spiritual energy within. He was satisfied with today’s journey.

He was eager to reach the summit quickly and see what the teleportation array looked like, as well as the memory-recovery item Kuang Long mentioned.

When Su Nantian opened his eyes, Kuang Long did the same. Their gazes met, and they both smiled.

Kuang Long hadn’t noticed Su Nantian waking—he had spent the night meditating, achieving no results. He noticed spiritual energy in the air gathering around Su Nantian, while his own absorption was minimal.

This made him even more puzzled by Su Nantian. His cultivation technique must be top-tier. Such absorption power could only rival a top-grade method. They knew their sect’s Grand Elders alone could cultivate top-tier techniques, and obtaining one required massive merit points.

He couldn’t fathom a youth possessing such a technique. This man’s strength must be formidable. Kuang Long was already scheming to seize his technique after using him.

When their gazes parted, Su Nantian felt slightly surprised. He saw greed and vigilance in the man’s eyes. Considering this man had been so热心 yesterday, Su Nantian dismissed it as a mistake and didn’t dwell on it.

“Ada, wake up. It’s time to depart.” Su Nantian’s voice was not loud but carried the power of a great bell.

Ada felt his master’s voice in his dream, calling him to wake. He sat up abruptly, bewildered by Su Nantian.

“Master, did you call me in my dream?” Ada asked curiously.

“After sleeping so long, would you wake up without me calling?” Su Nantian replied gruffly. “Hurry and get ready—what are you doing just standing there?”

Ada nodded eagerly, still remembering that voice. How could his master’s voice appear in a dream? It was so real.

He still felt like he was dreaming.

When Kuang Long heard the voice, his heart trembled, nearly destabilizing his composure. If he hadn’t misheard, this was a transmission technique.

His breath caught—what was this youth’s origin? Transmission techniques were only for Grand Masters. He had long desired to learn it but lacked the path. He had studied it repeatedly, yet failed each time.

“Father, do you fancy him?” Kuang Qingya suddenly thought of an odd idea as she watched her father’s dazed expression.

“Nonsense, I’m worrying about you.” Kuang Long blushed, glaring at her with a warning look.

“Ah!” Hearing his father’s words, Kuang Qingya’s face turned red instantly. She lowered her head, avoiding Su Nantian’s gaze, clutching her sleeves in confusion.

Kuang Long was stunned by his daughter’s shy demeanor. He had never seen this before—this delicate, blushing behavior was uncharacteristic of her.

Kuang Long’s breath quickened again as he glanced at Su Nantian, then his daughter. The implication was clear.

This youth had already captured his daughter’s heart—too cheap a prize.

Kuang Long hesitated, though the man’s technique intrigued him. His daughter liked him; becoming a son-in-law was acceptable. There would be time to seize the technique later.

This plan was perfect—two birds with one stone.

Chapter 947: Shock

Su Nantian observed the pair’s strange expressions, unsure why they stared at him like that. He felt a chill.

Especially now, Kuang Long’s gaze held an indescribable quality—strange.

Su Nantian used vines to rebind Ada to his back, then took the vines and said, “Now we can depart. I’m ready.”

Kuang Long finally snapped out of his trance and said, “Ready! Let’s tidy up quickly and depart.”

Su Nantian nodded slightly and stepped out first, leaping into the air.

The vines in his hands acted like extended arms, firmly gripping the cliff’s rocks without a single wobble. Su Nantian climbed swiftly, alternating between them.

When Kuang Long and his daughter reached the cave entrance to climb, they gazed in awe at Su Nantian on the cliff.

“Is this even human?” Kuang Long exclaimed, stunned. This man’s tool was just vines—yet with two blades, it was so formidable.

He remembered those vines had been limp before, but now they were rigid and strong. Even the two blades at the top seemed excessively sharp. He stared at the deep, visible cuts on the cliff wall, feeling a shiver of fear.

He knew this mountain grew colder higher up, with eternal snow and ice. The rocks were unusually hard due to the frost. Though he could manage it, it would demand immense effort and spiritual energy. Climbing this way wouldn’t last long. This youth might seem lively now, but he’d tire eventually.

Meanwhile, Kuang Qingya was speechless, stunned by his graceful movements. She had never seen anyone climb so elegantly.

Kuang Long, regaining his composure, looked at his daughter’s dazed expression. Though he was used to it, he was still surprised. He couldn’t adjust quickly.

As he pondered why his daughter had changed so much, Kuang Qingya suddenly turned to him. “What are you staring at? He’s already far ahead—we’ll miss him if we don’t hurry!”

Kuang Qingya said anxiously, even stomping her foot in impatience.

Kuang Long sighed, amused and exasperated. “What a daughter! She’s already favoring him.”

Kuang Long sighed, unable to do anything. Who else could he blame but his daughter?

“Alright, Princess, I’d never dare disobey you. Let’s chase after him.” Kuang Long smiled helplessly.

Kuang Long tied a rope around his and Kuang Qingya’s waists, then put on a pair of leather gloves. The gloves weren’t thick but remarkably tough.

These gloves were made from the hide of a dragon rhino—so strong that even top-tier profit couldn’t cut through them unless spiritual energy was channeled.

This dragon rhino glove also had a strong adhesive quality, making it essential for climbing. Most climbers used such gloves to ascend.

Kuang Long and Kuang Qingya leaped into the air, gripping the cliff with steady hands. Their breathing was stable, and their speed was even.

Kuang Qingya struggled to climb behind, but her heart grew anxious—after so long, she still couldn’t see Su Nantian. The endless cliff ahead was empty.

Her anxiety deepened.

Gradually, Kuang Long’s forehead broke out in sweat. He looked ahead but couldn’t find Su Nantian. He cursed inwardly, “This kid moves too fast! Doesn’t he need rest?”

He had climbed for nearly an hour but still couldn’t spot the youth. A strange thought arose: this kid didn’t need rest.

He calculated, if this speed continued, the youth would reach the summit quickly. This speed was faster than even the Grand Elder. He inhaled sharply.

As he rested, Kuang Qingya complained, “Father, are you still this slow? It’s been so long and we still can’t see him.”

Kuang Qingya looked up at the empty sky, no sign of him.

Kuang Long’s face reddened. His speed was good; today’s condition was excellent. Normally, she didn’t complain about it.

He quickly realized the truth—this kid had stolen his daughter’s heart. That damned kid.

Kuang Long cursed inwardly.

As he continued climbing, a vine descended from above, stopping ten feet up.

The familiar vine loomed in his eyes, expanding like a terrifying weapon. His breath stopped, nearly causing him to fall off the cliff.

As he pretended not to see and changed direction, Kuang Qingya’s voice rang out: “Father, look there!”

Kuang Long reluctantly followed her finger. This was it—under Kuang Qingya’s urging, he slowly climbed toward the vine.

The sight of the vine felt like a slap to his face, implying he climbed too slowly. Yet it was true—he was indeed slow.

When he gripped the vine, it felt solid. This youth had chosen a good anchor point. With this vine, he could climb faster.

But the next moment, he was stunned—when he tried to climb with his own strength, a powerful force pulled him upward. His body was lifted steadily, and his speed increased significantly.

At this moment, his mind felt struck by lightning. This youth was no human—perhaps he had innate superhuman strength.

He thought of the previous image of this youth, so light and agile. If he had innate strength, everything made sense. His daughter hadn’t misjudged him.

This youth’s power was likely stronger than his own. Having such a man as a son-in-law would be no loss, especially since his daughter was the sect’s Holy Maiden. Taking him in as a son-in-law wouldn’t be a bad deal.

Kuang Long used the rope’s strength, pushing with his feet. Soon, he saw Su Nantian above.

Chapter 948: Familiarity

His thoughts slowed as he confirmed Su Nantian’s innate strength.

Ada silently watched Su Nantian, feeling his master was a monster—his strength seemed endless. This deepened Ada’s admiration for Su Nantian.

Su Nantian, seeing only ten meters left, kicked powerfully and pulled them both up.

After landing, Kuang Qingya lowered her head, glancing at Su Nantian with a furtive look.

Kuang Long felt his face redden, surprised he needed the youth’s help. He found Su Nantian increasingly suitable as a son-in-law—this man was responsible and admirable.

“Let’s continue,” Su Nantian said directly. He was eager to see the nine-level treasure pagoda.

Kuang Long’s mouth opened but closed again. He had intended to suggest a rest, but this youth wanted to continue climbing. Didn’t he get tired?

Su Nantian’s words made it hard for him to speak further. Kuang Long took a breath but saw Su Nantian had already resumed climbing.

He looked at Su Nantian’s rapid ascent and sighed, “People are incomparable—youth is truly the best.”

Kuang Long quickly led his daughter upward. However, she was soon left behind by Su Nantian. Though it angered him, he had no power to reclaim his dignity—his strength was insufficient.

After Su Nantian climbed 500 meters, he felt the air colder than below. The spiritual energy was denser, and his strength didn’t wane but grew stronger.

He felt like a furnace inside, with endless energy. Yet Ada behind him struggled against the cold wind. Though he could directly use spiritual energy to protect him, Su Nantian didn’t do so.

Instead, he taught Ada to use spiritual energy to resist the cold. Though it was difficult at first, Su Nantian wanted to test this child’s potential.

Feeling Ada shivering on his back, Su Nantian smiled slightly. He slowed his pace.

Soon, Ada’s energy stabilized, and he stopped trembling. Su Nantian smiled—his judgment was correct; this child had extraordinary talent.

Su Nantian no longer hesitated and accelerated rapidly, reaching the summit in half a day.

Su Nantian leaped into the air and landed firmly on solid ground.

He surveyed the surroundings, but there was no nine-level treasure pagoda in sight. He doubted Kuang Long had deceived him.

Only a few pillars surrounded the cliff, nothing more—almost desolate. This made Su Nantian frown.
