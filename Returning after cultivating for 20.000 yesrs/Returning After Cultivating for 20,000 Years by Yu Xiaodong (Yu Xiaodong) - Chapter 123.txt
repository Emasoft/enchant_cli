Chapter 613: Refinement

After hearing San Tian's words, Nan Gong Lin merely smiled without uttering a word. After a while, he finally said to San Tian: "You're quite the talker, but don't you think what you just said missed the point entirely? Everyone knows how to manipulate through profit. Is there no other method besides that? And most importantly, what kind of profit are you talking about, and where will it come from?"

Nan Gong Lin's words struck the core of San Tian's plan, as San Tian had never clearly explained how to execute it.

San Tian inwardly marveled at the old fox's sharpness; Nan Gong Lin's words always landed precisely where they needed to, and the crux of the issue was clear. If they could resolve this matter, the plan would be feasible.

At the same time, San Tian realized that Nan Gong Lin's interest in this plan and his guidance to refine it implied that he had already tacitly approved the method. This meant they were most likely to proceed with this plan.

San Tian's eyes lit up as he glanced at Nan Gong Yu Yan, who was still bewildered by San Tian's sudden excitement. Curious, Nan Gong Yu Yan asked: "Did you think of a method?"

Although Nan Gong Lin admired San Tian to some extent, he remained wary. San Tian's background was too legitimate. Suddenly, the Nan Gong clan had a person who excelled in both martial and scholarly arts, who had been devotedly serving them without hesitation. He had checked San Tian's income and found that aside from what Nan Gong Ping might have secretly given him, all other official records had been verified. San Tian's monthly salary was no different from that of other security guards.

Moreover, Nan Gong Lin didn't know that Nan Gong Ping never gave San Tian money. If he did, he would have suspected San Tian even more.

This very fact made Nan Gong Lin increasingly suspicious of San Tian, thinking that someone so willing to serve as a bodyguard for the Nan Gong clan with such an insignificant salary, and yet so diligently offering strategies, must have ulterior motives. His relentless effort to gain their trust was precisely to achieve that end.

Seeing that Nan Gong Yu Yan didn't understand his glance, San Tian didn't dwell further. His mind raced as he followed Nan Gong Lin's guidance to refine his plan.

Previously, San Tian had only a rough framework but lacked details, which was one of the reasons he hadn't proposed the plan initially.

"We can directly impersonate Li Zhe to recruit soldiers and manpower, secretly spreading rumors about improved treatment. At the same time, we must offer tangible benefits to a portion of people. We can invest a small amount first, letting the initial group receive these benefits. Once they truly obtain them, those who were hesitant will also join. Even if we delay the money slightly, it's acceptable."

San Tian was gradually refining his plan and beginning to consider specific strategies.

"Then where will this initial profit come from? Are you expecting the Nan Gong clan to bear such a massive risk and cover all these expenses?" Nan Gong Lin asked again, his words hitting the core of the issue.

As Nan Gong Lin said, San Tian's initial profit cost was unclear who would bear it, and the risk was high.

"I think this money should be borne by the Nan Gong clan, but we only need to cover the initial portion. The rest will naturally come from other sources," San Tian mused, offering what he believed was the most refined solution.

"How much is your budget? Where will the remaining funds come from?" Nan Gong Lin's question was another step in guiding San Tian to refine his plan.

At this moment, Nan Gong Yu Yan understood: if her father had no interest or confidence in the plan, he wouldn't have asked so many questions. Every question he hadn't yet posed was helping San Tian refine the framework of his plan. Once these critical issues were resolved, they could proceed.

At this moment, Nan Gong Yu Yan finally understood why San Tian had suddenly looked at her with such excitement. From that moment, San Tian had already realized his plan had received Nan Gong Lin's tacit approval. This meant they would use San Tian's proposed method to solve this issue.

Nan Gong Yu Yan now felt foolish for being so slow compared to San Tian. Yet she couldn't help but admire San Tian's quick thinking and intelligence. Not only was the plan his idea, but all subsequent details and refinements were also being expanded under Nan Gong Lin's guidance.

"Local bosses have about a thousand workers in total, while Li Zhe has around two hundred. We should start with this group first and then attract more people. Therefore, the initial budget is about 500,000 yuan, which may expand to a million. However, the Nan Gong clan doesn't need to cover all of it; we only need to contribute around 200,000 yuan."

As San Tian thought and calculated Li Zhe's personnel and the benefits he would propose, he estimated a rough figure.

"200,000 yuan is manageable. It's reasonable for the Nan Gong clan to invest this amount in this matter. However, where will the remaining funds come from? Do you expect to conjure money out of thin air?"

This question genuinely puzzled Nan Gong Lin, who was curious about San Tian's plan. The remaining funds were a significant expense, and he wondered how San Tian could find an unsuspecting investor to cover it.

After Nan Gong Lin's question, San Tian let out a sly laugh and said: "Take from the people, use for the people. Naturally, it comes from Li Zhe himself. After all, we are helping him expand his influence."

Chapter 614: Finalization

Seeing San Tian's sly smile, Nan Gong Lin was momentarily stunned. He hadn't expected San Tian to have thought so far ahead, even surpassing his own thoughts.

At this moment, San Tian stopped smiling and continued: "Since we benefit from Li Zhe, he must contribute some blood. Naturally, he can't bear all the remaining costs. Instead, we'll take it from another batch of private gains. In the end, a small proportion will be distributed to the other two local bosses, while Li Zhe's share will directly fund this operation. How can we allow Li Zhe to gain both people and money? That would make the Nan Gong clan's efforts meaningless."

San Tian's words were logical. Li Zhe definitely needed to pay a price to expand his influence, and this method was the best.

"Once we recruit soldiers and buy horses, we'll effectively destroy their framework. Moreover, we have leverage over Li Zhe; I'm sure he won't dare to oppose them in the remaining year."

As San Tian spoke, his ideas became clearer. Following Nan Gong Lin's review of his initial framework, he had completed the entire plan, though some details would need to be adjusted when implemented.

However, even after San Tian fully explained the plan, it still depended on Nan Gong Lin's approval. If he didn't agree, even a perfectly refined plan would be useless, as this was ultimately about the Nan Gong clan's interests, not just San Tian's personal gain.

At this moment, Nan Gong Lin remained silent, so San Tian gradually lost his smile. He glanced at Nan Gong Yu Yan, who sat silently beside him. The three of them remained silent, waiting for Nan Gong Lin to speak.

Yet San Tian was unaware that Nan Gong Lin wasn't considering whether the plan was feasible but instead once again speculated about San Tian's identity and background. He thought that someone with such a sharp mind couldn't be merely a lowly security guard or a simple rural boy.

Someone with such flexible thinking must have experienced great storms and couldn't be as San Tian claimed, a first-time traveler from his so-called village.

However, just before this, Nan Gong Lin had ordered his housekeeper to thoroughly investigate San Tian's identity. The investigation yielded nothing, matching San Tian's current statements perfectly with no flaws.

Yet the more perfect it was, the more Nan Gong Lin felt suspicious. Moreover, after years of navigating the business world and leading the Nan Gong clan from decline to success, his cautious nature had been crucial. Thus, Nan Gong Lin still trusted his instincts and believed San Tian was hiding something, even if he hadn't found evidence yet.

But Nan Gong Lin also thought he could utilize San Tian during this period. If heaven wanted to gain his trust, it would certainly do so through the current state of affairs, allowing San Tian to fully commit to the Nan Gong clan's efforts. Thus, he could handle many matters with San Tian during this time.

Therefore, Nan Gong Lin thought that after the inland port incident concluded, he could directly transfer San Tian back to Nan Gong Ping's side. After all, Nan Gong Ping faced Wu Chuan, which was more challenging.

In the inland port, Nan Gong Yu Yan had already found Wu Chuan's three local bosses difficult to handle. This proved that when Nan Gong Ping faced Wu Chuan himself, the situation would be even more complicated. Thus, Nan Gong Lin must plant someone there to assist Nan Gong Ping in analyzing and handling the situation.

In principle, the housekeeper was the most suitable candidate, but his age made him unsuitable for such tasks.

Therefore, at this moment, the best choice for Nan Gong Lin was none other than San Tian before him.

Nan Gong Lin remained silent for a long time, and Nan Gong Yu Yan finally couldn't hold back.

She reached out to push Nan Gong Lin's shoulder and said, "What are you thinking? We're discussing the inland port issue now. Is this plan feasible or not?"

Nan Gong Yu Yan was impatient and didn't know what her father was thinking, so she directly asked.

At this moment, Nan Gong Lin snapped out of his thoughts and said, "I've been reviewing the matter, considering its feasibility. Although this method indeed changes the situation in the inland port as you said, it seems a bit excessive for our Nan Gong clan. However, given the current issue, it's the best solution. So you two proceed with this plan. Once the framework is changed and we control Li Zhe within a year, it will be very convenient for us."

At this point, Nan Gong Lin suddenly remembered something and turned to San Tian: "Don't forget to persuade Li Zhe. That's the initial step. Only after convincing him can you proceed with the rest. If Li Zhe refuses, the entire plan will fail. So your main task now is to get Li Zhe involved in this plan, making him understand the saying 'to catch a wolf, you must sacrifice children.'"

Nan Gong Lin's meaning was simple. He feared that Li Zhe might refuse these conditions, as he would have to pay for them himself. Thus, the task of persuading Li Zhe fell directly on San Tian.

San Tian naturally understood Nan Gong Lin's words and nodded seriously, saying: "Master, rest assured. I'll handle this. The rest will be my responsibility, and the lady will supervise."

San Tian couldn't refuse, and he needed to perform well to gain Nan Gong Lin's trust. However, San Tian also remembered Nan Gong Yu Yan's situation and thus gave her a high compliment to let her observe from the sidelines.

After hearing San Tian's assurance, Nan Gong Lin nodded, especially pleased that San Tian had mentioned Nan Gong Yu Yan's name. Many people wanted to achieve success before him, but they always overlooked his two children.

But for Nan Gong Lin, others' success was their own; the most important thing was to assist his two children in achieving success.

Chapter 615: Interests

Nan Gong Lin had already tacitly approved Su Nantian's plan and was very supportive of him proceeding. He had now entrusted all the details of this plan to Su Nantian and let Nan Gong Yu Yan supervise.

After receiving Nan Gong Lin's approval, Su Nantian felt somewhat reassured. Although he had thought of this method, he hadn't proposed it or told Nan Gong Yu Yan before because he felt the plan was too elaborate and excessive for the Nan Gong clan, which only had a one-year operational right in the inland port.

But now that even Nan Gong Lin had nodded, Su Nantian only needed to execute the plan properly.

After obtaining Nan Gong Lin's approval, Su Nantian and Nan Gong Yu Yan left Nan Gong Lin's villa.

"You've done well this time, which will definitely gain my father's trust. Isn't this exactly the initial goal?" As they walked toward Nan Gong Yu Yan's villa, she suddenly said.

Su Nantian could tell that Nan Gong Yu Yan's words still carried resentment toward him, as she hadn't forgiven him for concealing his identity to enter the Nan Gong clan in order to save Wu's family.

After hearing this, Su Nantian felt awkward and didn't know how to respond, so he remained silent.

"Anyway, do well. If you complete this task, I definitely won't expose you. And the things I promised you before will also be fulfilled."

Nan Gong Yu Yan stood beside Su Nantian without speaking. For some reason, she felt angry and thus said this before walking away in a huff.

Su Nantian saw Nan Gong Yu Yan leave quickly and felt helpless, unsure how to respond. But chasing after her now seemed inappropriate. Thus, Su Nantian could only maintain his original pace and follow behind.

But at this moment, Nan Gong Yu Yan was still thinking about whether Su Nantian would chase after her. However, after she had walked for a long time and turned back, she found that Su Nantian was no longer in her line of sight. It turned out she had walked too fast, and Su Nantian still maintained his original pace, widening the distance between them.

"Such a clueless person!" Nan Gong Yu Yan muttered under her breath and shook her hair before heading toward her villa.

At this moment, Su Nantian was still thinking about how to persuade Li Zhe and realized that if he did this well, it wouldn't just please Nan Gong Yu Yan but also significantly improve Nan Gong Lin's opinion of him. After all, this matter had already been communicated to Nan Gong Lin and was personally approved by him. Thus, this task could be fundamentally considered as a command from Nan Gong Lin.

Su Nantian thought about this all night and decided that the approach should focus on interests, as no matter how he analyzed it, this matter was related to interests. Even if Li Zhe wanted to expand his territory and power, it was all for the purpose of gaining more benefits.

Therefore, Su Nantian believed that if he approached this from the angle of interests, he would definitely be able to get Li Zhe to cooperate with him. Although Su Nantian hadn't met Li Zhe many times, he could clearly feel that Li Zhe was dissatisfied with his current position among the three local bosses.

Thus, if Su Nantian could ensure that this matter would elevate Li Zhe's status in the inland port, he should be willing to cooperate.

After arriving at the inland port, Su Nantian didn't go to his office but instead went directly to Li Zhe's territory when no one was around.

Li Zhe had arrived early and was already at the inland port. When he saw Su Nantian coming so early, he was confused.

Li Zhe grabbed Su Nantian and pulled him into his office, closing the door as he asked with a reproachful look: "What's going on? Why did you come so early? Are you trying to let others know we have a relationship?"

Su Nantian smiled and pushed his hand away, saying: "Don't worry. I checked carefully to make sure no one followed me or saw me. Why would I bother you?"

After hearing this, Li Zhe relaxed slightly but still frowned and said impatiently: "Then why did you come so early to find me? If there's no urgent matter, don't come. Although we are cooperating now, don't forget to keep our relationship hidden. The farther apart we stay, the better."

Li Zhe was very cautious about this matter and didn't want others to know their cooperation. Although he didn't say what the consequences would be if people found out, one year later when the Nan Gong clan left the inland port, it would be like a test. Therefore, they needed to plan carefully. If they offended Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo now, they might face greater retaliation after a year.

"I came for an important matter. Otherwise, I wouldn't have taken such a risk. This time, I want to discuss a bigger deal with you. I can guarantee this deal will bring you great benefits and may change the balance among these local bosses. If you cooperate with us, your status in the inland port might directly surpass Wang Bo and even Zhang Yuan."

After hearing this, Li Zhe was slightly moved. He had always wanted to elevate his status in the inland port but found it difficult because the current power structure was like an iron water bucket with no gaps.

Moreover, the current balance in the inland port was very stable. Even if Li Zhe wanted to recruit more people under his command, he lacked the capital to offer better conditions than others. Thus, all his ambitions to expand his power and territory were just fantasies in his mind, and putting them into practice was too difficult.

But now Su Nantian said he could help him, and his backer was the Nan Gong clan. If the Nan Gong clan truly wanted to help him, it would be fine to make a deal with them.

With such a powerful ally for a short period, once his power and territory expanded, he could solidify his position. Even if the Nan Gong clan left later, he wouldn't fear them.

After hearing this news, Li Zhe nodded: "Of course, we can talk about it. But now isn't the best time. I need to take them to work immediately. Let's talk tonight."

Chapter 616: Ambitions

After hearing Li Zhe's words, Su Nantian nodded and they agreed on the time and place for their meeting. Then Su Nantian left first.

That night, Su Nantian arrived as scheduled at the location he had agreed with Li Zhe. He told the server his reserved room name, and she led him there. When he entered the private room, he found Li Zhe already seated there and even started drinking alcohol.

"Sit down. See if the dishes you ordered are to your liking. The menu is here; feel free to add more," Li Zhe said, pointing to the seat beside him and placing the menu in front of Su Nantian with a rough, gangster-like manner.

However, Su Nantian found this approach quite agreeable because he liked talking to such straightforward people.

After ordering a few dishes, Su Nantian immediately got down to business: "I came here for an important matter. As I said, if this is done well, your status in the inland port can expand both your power and territory. But what you need to do is cooperate with us, the Nan Gong clan."

"Such a good deal I would naturally agree. But the better the conditions, the more I have to pay. So what exactly are you two planning?"

Li Zhe understood this clearly, having spent years navigating the business world. Although he was just overseeing a group of brothers in the inland port, he understood human relationships and knew that nothing came for free; one had to pay the corresponding price.

Su Nantian smiled slightly and continued: "Do you remember that private job we discussed before? If we let them do it, the Nan Gong clan would lose a significant profit. But if we send people to block them, what do you think will happen?"

Su Nantian didn't finish his sentence but shifted the focus to Li Zhe.

"These brothers are all eating and supporting their families with this money. They have old people and children at home. Their wages aren't high, so they rely on a few private jobs to earn some money. Even if the Nan Gong clan has great connections and sends a group of bodyguards to block them, it would only cause these people to riot."

Li Zhe responded without hesitation: "That's right. So the Nan Gong clan isn't foolish. Even if they live comfortably, they know this matter brings them no profit and would only face resistance from these workers. In the end, they'd gain nothing."

Su Nantian was correct; these workers didn't care who controlled the inland port. They only cared about whether they could earn money as before.

Indeed, when Wu's family controlled the inland port, they could earn money. But this year, if it changed to the Nan Gong clan and they couldn't get this profit, they would naturally resent the Nan Gong clan. And such a riot was inevitable.

Therefore, Zhang Yuan and others wanted to secretly keep this batch of private goods. They had originally signed a profit-sharing agreement with Wu's family, but now they wanted to keep all the profits without giving anything to the Nan Gong clan. That was the biggest problem. If they still shared profits as before with Wu's family, the Nan Gong clan wouldn't have done this.

"So what method has your Nan Gong clan come up with to deal with it? You didn't come here just for this, did you? But how can you guarantee that my territory and power will expand?"

Li Zhe wasn't naive. He was very sharp, and as soon as Su Nantian spoke, he sensed the deeper meaning. However, what concerned him most was how the Nan Gong clan could ensure his territory and power would expand if he helped them.

"I'll tell you directly: we plan to trick Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo. Their workers are more because their conditions are better than yours, or perhaps your conditions are the same, but your territory is smaller and not worth their moving. Your power hasn't changed much over the years because you don't have enough capital to change your conditions. But now, if the Nan Gong clan supports you with some money, you can expand and attract these people to your name."

As Su Nantian spoke, he smiled slyly and waited for Li Zhe's response.

After hearing this, Li Zhe was extremely tempted because every word Su Nantian spoke was the obstacle he had struggled against for years.

Li Zhe had always wanted to expand his power and territory, giving more brothers under him. However, the number of people in the inland port was limited. Even if new people came, they would first choose a larger stronghold. Why would they prioritize him, the weakest?

Moreover, Su Nantian was correct; that's why they chose Zhang Yuan or Wang Bo—they offered better conditions. Li Zhe had previously tried to improve his conditions to attract new people, but after absorbing less than a hundred people, he found his funds were tight and had to change how much they received. Thus, those who had just moved over returned because they clearly saw Li Zhe couldn't sustain such expenses for so many people.

So if the Nan Gong clan now agreed to provide some funds to help him attract more people, he certainly had confidence in expanding his territory.

"What's my cost? The Nan Gong clan won't give this money without reason, and I don't think your helping me expand my territory will solve the issue of this private job's profits."

Even though he was very tempted, Li Zhe remained cautious. He knew the Nan Gong clan, despite their wealth, wouldn't help him without conditions. Therefore, there must be something he could offer the Nan Gong clan to gain their desired benefits.

Chapter 617: Cooperation

After hearing Li Zhe's question, Su Nantian knew he had to explain the entire plan to persuade him.

"It's simple: your territory expands, and you have more workers. Once a certain proportion is achieved, combined with the bodyguards the Nan Gong clan hires, we'll have absolute priority in this private job. No one else can touch this job except your people, and it's clear to them that from now on, only your group can handle these private jobs."

As Su Nantian spoke, he smiled. Li Zhe's face showed a very shocked expression after hearing this.

"You're crazy! You knew that if we really did this, the remaining workers would definitely riot. Then how could we control it?" Obviously, Li Zhe wasn't satisfied with Su Nantian's plan and thought the risk was too high.

"If you had done this before, they would have rioted. But if you managed to get all of their people, even if they still had some left, we'd have an absolute advantage in numbers. Moreover, the ones clashing with them aren't our Nan Gong clan's bodyguards but other workers in the inland port. Between having everyone eat and enjoying fine meals, or you eating delicacies while others starve, which would you choose?"

Su Nantian's final analogy was very appropriate. If no one blocked this private job, it would be all the workers in the inland port sharing a profit. Everyone gets money but only a small amount, and obviously, the local bosses get the most.

But if Su Nantian's plan was carried out and only Li Zhe's workers could profit from this, each person would get much more than before. Everyone would care only about their own interests; who cares if others eat or not?

Moreover, the conflict would be between workers, so the inland port's order wouldn't collapse.

Because of Su Nantian's simple analogy, Li Zhe immediately understood the key point of his plan. However, for him, there was still one important thing: how to attract these people now, and it seemed all the benefits were for himself. So what did the Nan Gong clan really want?

"What else do you want from us besides this private job?"

After hearing Li Zhe's question, Su Nantian nodded and spoke without hesitation: "First, tell me what the current profit-sharing ratio is between you and Wu's family?"

"Seven to three. We get seven, but these funds are also divided among our colleagues based on territory and power. So I end up with less than a third of that seven." Li Zhe said this with a helpless shake of his head. This was one reason he had wanted to expand his power for years.

"If you agree to cooperate with us, the ratio changes to five and five. And for this private job, you don't take any personal share."

After Su Nantian said this, Li Zhe looked very shocked and said: "Where would my money come from? If you do this, I won't cooperate with you."

"The money to recruit other workers for you before the private job is provided by our Nan Gong clan. But after the private job, don't you want to recruit more people? So this money will be used to recruit people and repay the loan we gave you from the Nan Gong clan."

"But five and five is too unfair for us," Li Zhe said after hearing this, but he swallowed his anger. However, he was still dissatisfied with the ratio.

"You can do the math. Even if it's five and five, the money you get will be more than before because Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo won't share this part. You'll have much more than before," Su Nantian said with a smile, staring at Li Zhe. He knew that after saying this, the result should appear.

After hearing this, Li Zhe thought for a moment and nodded: "Okay, I'll gamble with your Nan Gong clan! If this fails, I won't be able to survive in the inland port."

"If you can't survive in the inland port, I'll always welcome you to the Nan Gong clan."

"Good! Ha ha ha!" After hearing Su Nantian's words, Li Zhe laughed again and raised his glass to drink with Su Nantian. It seemed he had finally decided to take this gamble.
