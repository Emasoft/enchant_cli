Even some individuals had already retrieved their mobile phones to dial the patrol unit.

The bald man felt an even more intense pain at his wrist, searing and bone-deep, like waves of agony cresting one after another.

“You’re done, kid,” the bald man snarled, his teeth clenched. He then used his other hand to dial a phone.

“Jun Ge, come to Haolin Property immediately; someone is bullying me.”

After hanging up, he gazed at his left hand, which was swollen to the point of being unrecognizable.

“Why are you still standing there? Hurry and call an ambulance,” the bald man barked at the tall woman who stood frozen.

Soon, Haolin Property’s security personnel surrounded the area.

Wang Yanbing also rushed over urgently.

When he saw Lu Zhe’s wrist twisted 90 degrees, he was taken aback.

“Lu Ge, what happened to you? Who did this?” Wang Yanbing’s eyes narrowed. Who the hell dared to cause trouble on his turf?

“Manager Wang, you’ve finally arrived. It’s this kid.”

Lu Zhe glared at Su Nantian with venom, as if he wanted to devour him.

Wang Yanbing narrowed his eyes, recognizing the familiar face. A grin spread across his lips.

“Unexpectedly, we’ve met so soon. Daring to cause trouble at Haolin Property—see who’ll save you this time, even the Lin family won’t help.”

His small eyes flashed with menace, as if shooting lightning.

“Security, take him down.”

Instantly, the surrounding security personnel seized their wooden batons and converged on Su Nantian.

Chapter 51: Disobedient

“Truly an old enemy, meeting you everywhere,” Su Nantian mocked.

“You still talk back? Ignorance is no excuse. You don’t know who’s behind Haolin Property.” Wang Yanbing seized the opportunity, unable to act outside but now in control here with Chairman Gao’s support. He knew well that the Lin family’s members were nothing to Gao’s clan.

Lu Zhe felt elated, not expecting Manager Wang to have a grudge against this kid. Perfect.

“Beat him mercilessly.”

Wang Yanbing’s command was met with a cruel smile.

The security personnel hesitated not, raising their batons with force and surrounding Su Nantian from head to toe. A 360-degree attack.

The crowd’s expressions varied—fear, excitement.

Meanwhile, the saleswomen nearby had retreated far away, cowed by the atmosphere.

Crack! Crack! Crack!

Instead of the anticipated collision between batons and flesh, a sound of splintering wood echoed.

Moments later, Wang Yanbing saw the security personnel slowly retreating, forming a green mountain. He couldn’t see what was happening inside but was annoyed by the absence of screams.

“Why are you doing this? Don’t you want your jobs? Do you think Haolin Group’s money is free?”

The security personnel, mere mortals unaccustomed to bloodshed or murder, were horrified by the broken batons.

Hearing the roar behind them, they reluctantly faced the terrifying man again. For their families and infants depending on them, they had no choice.

“Brothers, sorry.” One spoke.

They all raised the remaining half of their batons and charged forward again, as if the fragments could grant them unparalleled strength.

Before the crowd fully grasped what was happening, they gaped in shock at an astonishing sight.

Each security officer flew out like a green mountain collapsing, their bodies precisely landing on Wang Yanbing and Lu Zhe. Soon, another mountain formed.

Su Nantian stood tall, unscathed amidst the splintered batons.

A palpable aura rose from his presence.

“Wow, so cool!”
“If only my boyfriend were a hundredth as awesome.”
“This guy seems familiar.”
“I’ve recorded it all! All of it!”
“Give me a copy, give me one.”
“Follow my XX video account: XXXX to watch it.”

……

A car soon pulled up at Haolin Property’s sales office. Five individuals stepped out, dressed in uniforms—especially the leader, radiating allure.

“Patrol team!”

Mu Yan’s brows furrowed. Today, relatives had come for a rest, but he was patrolling nearby and received a call from the team.

Upon entering, he saw a green mountain and the person he had long awaited.

“Su Nantian, I’ll see how you run this time,” Mu Yan clenched his fists. No need to ask—this scoundrel had beaten someone.

“Captain, please do justice for me! It’s him who beat me!”

Lu Zhe struggled to crawl out of the pile, surprised it was a woman instead of Jun Ge. He hesitated.

What was there to fear? I was the one injured.

He immediately gestured wildly, describing what had transpired. Even Mu Yan’s suggestion to send him to the hospital was rejected outright.

Meanwhile, Wang Yanbing pulled out his phone, dialed Chairman Gao’s number, and ended the call.

Yet, on the other end, a young man in his mid-20s paused, then prepared to summon someone.

The phone rang again!

“Gao Shengyun, if you want to keep your position, immediately go to Haolin Property. There’s a young man named Su Nantian there—make sure he forgives you. If you fail, pack your things and leave.”

A furious roar echoed through the receiver, making his ears ring.

No need to think—this was definitely Wang Yanbing’s pitiful act.

He immediately rushed toward Haolin Property.

“Now you have no words, right?” After hearing Lu Zhe’s account, Mu Yan smiled at Su Nantian. From behind, he retrieved handcuffs.

“What are you doing?” Lin Suyun saw Mu Yan and felt a surge of anger.

“What do you think I’m doing? Arresting this pervert and violent man. Don’t interfere here.”

Mu Yan glanced at Lin Suyun.

“Suyun, it’s nothing. I’ll be back soon.”

Handcuffs were locked on Su Nantian, and the other pair was fastened to her wrist.

“Beauty, you really want to hold hands with me? Seems like you’re disobedient.” Su Nantian smiled, his eyes wandering over her body. Still that one-size-too-small uniform.

“Stop talking nonsense. Let’s go.” Mu Yan wished to dig out his eyes right then.

“Wait, he can’t be taken yet—he’s being watched by our chairman.” Wang Yanbing hurried over. The chairman’s envoy was arriving soon; if this kid were taken, how could they punish him?

“You’re not even a green bean! Today I’m taking this man.” Mu Yan’s face darkened. Another person was blocking him.

“You…” Wang Yanbing hadn’t expected this pure-faced woman to be so fierce.

At that moment, his phone rang. Seeing the caller ID, he was thrilled—but in an instant, his entire body collapsed. He hung up.

“Did you call Su Nantian?” Wang Yanbing trembled, pointing at Su Nantian.

“Ah, yes, I am Su Nantian.”

Someone had already acted—speed was truly fast.

Hearing “Su Nantian,” Wang Yanbing felt his soul almost flee, his mind blank.

He hadn’t imagined this man was connected to the Gao family.

His knees trembled uncontrollably, and he fell to his knees with a thud.

“Master Su, I didn’t recognize your greatness and offended you. Please forgive me. I don’t know this person.”

His head collided with the ground repeatedly, his mouth begging for mercy.

Meanwhile, Lu Zhe stood in distant bewilderment, watching Wang Yanbing kneel.

What was going on?

“Lu Zhe, who bullied you?”

Wu Jun strode into the sales office.

“Jun Ge, you’ve finally arrived! It’s this kid. Look at my hand—he beat me.”

Lu Zhe felt elated, not questioning why Wang Yanbing knelt. He quickly raised his broken hand.

“Damn it, who’s so bold?”

Wu Jun followed Lu Zhe’s finger.

His heart jolted.

Mu Yan, and that kid.

Chapter 52: Taken Again

Wu Jun’s expression was strange as he looked at Lu Zhe. “How did you provoke him? He’s the boyfriend of the Lin family’s daughter.”

“The Lin family? Which one?” Lu Zhe looked puzzled, then realization dawned. “Not…?”

“Idiot, there’s only one Lin family in Fengcheng. I can’t handle it.” Wu Jun sighed.

“Quickly go apologize.” Wu Jun pulled Lu Zhe, who stood frozen.

“Zhang Xue, it’s fate again. You’ve caught this kid again. He’s the Lin family…” Wu Jun felt elated but saw Su Nantian with a troubled expression.

Hmph, I can’t handle you, but Zhang Xue dares to?

Today the captain wasn’t here. Once I get back, I’ll deal with you. Remembering that incident, he felt irritated. He’d seen the video online but didn’t believe it.

“What Lin family? Nothing matters to me.”

Zhang Xue cut him off abruptly. He’d hoped not to meet Wu Jun today, but now…

“Oh, by the way, sir, after your wounds are treated, you’ll need to make a record.”

Zhang Xue looked at Lu Zhe with joy. Now there were witnesses and surveillance footage.

“Ah, no, it’s not like that. The incident had nothing to do with this gentleman. I provoked the beautiful lady, and this hand was my own mistake. It has nothing to do with this gentleman or Miss Lin.” Lu Zhe’s face darkened instantly upon hearing he’d need to testify.

The Lin family—he couldn’t handle them. Thinking of touching her buttocks earlier, he shivered.

Seeing Wang Yanbing kneel on the ground, he immediately knelt too.

Two people kneeling fiercely, their heads bleeding gradually.

At that moment, the tall woman crawled out from under the crowd, furious. Seeing her bruised and battered body, she exploded with anger. She’d hoped Lu Zhe would avenge her, but he knelt instead.

She approached and pointed at Lu Zhe: “You coward! You get beaten and still apologize.”

She couldn’t bear it anymore. Seeing the patrol team, she had no fear.

Lu Zhe suddenly stood up, his eyes bloodshot. He slapped the woman across the face.

“Stupid bitch, if you don’t want to live, don’t drag me down. Sir, this woman has nothing to do with me.”

He knelt again.

Ugh! The tall woman clutched her face and cried.

“No fear, they can’t do anything to you,” Zhang Xue was angry. The Lin family couldn’t be lawless, could they?

“Why are you looking at me? I didn’t force them. They did it willingly.” Su Nantian looked at Zhang Xue’s hostile gaze.

At that moment, someone approached Zhang Xue.

“Captain, the surveillance video was deleted.”

“What? Despicable and shameless.”

Zhang Xue cursed loudly.

Su Nantian smiled: “So angry, it’s bad for your health. Though women have their days, you should take care of yourself. But no worries, I can help.”

“Captain, since there’s no accuser and no video evidence, it has nothing to do with my South Tian.” Lin Suyun stepped forward and held Su Nantian’s other hand. Seeing their hands so close, she was unpleased.

“Hmph, there are so many people here. You don’t have to be blind. Ask them.” Zhang Xue wasn’t giving up this rare opportunity.

Soon, the man returned.

“Captain, look.”

He opened a video.

It was Su Nantian kicking the security officers away.

“What else do you have to say? Hmph.”

After saying that, Su Nantian was led away. He glanced at the two kneeling on the ground and said, “Useless trash.”

Not yet out of the gate, he heard a strong wind and a rumbling sound.

A helicopter!

That was the first word in Zhang Xue’s mind.

It couldn’t be wrong.

Then, a ladder was lowered from the helicopter, and a man descended.

Gao Shengyun saw the patrol team and that young man. He cursed inwardly, hurried over.

“Guess this is Mr. Su? I’m Gao Shengyun, the head of Haolin Property. Please forgive our hospitality.”

Gao Shengyun quickly apologized.

“Big show,” Zhang Xue coldly said.

“Captain, this whole thing was a misunderstanding. Haolin Property’s people started it first; Mr. Su only defended himself. Please release him.” Gao Shengyun raised his head and said, having already understood the whole story on the plane.

“This isn’t your decision. Even if it was self-defense, I’ll take him back. I don’t have time to discuss this with you. Talk too much, and I’ll take you too.” Zhang Xue gave no face.

She didn’t know Gao Shengyun.

“Are you sure? Do you know who Mr. Su is? He’s a guest of the Fengcheng Gao family!” Gao Shengyun was desperate. If Mr. Su were taken, he’d be ruined.

“Gao family? I don’t know them. Never heard of it. Even if I did, I wouldn’t care.”

Zhang Xue was determined to take Su Nantian.

Gao Shengyun nearly went mad. He’d never heard anyone insult the Gao family like this. This girl was truly overconfident.

The Gao family, in his heart, was like a deity—untouchable.

He was furious.

About to act, he heard Su Nantian speak.

“Gao Shengyun, those two inside are yours to deal with. Punish them; the Gao family won’t trouble you.”

“Good, Mr. Su, I’ll definitely not disappoint you.” Gao Shengyun felt like he’d been reborn. Though he didn’t know why Mr. Su protected that woman, he wisely didn’t ask.

“Suyun, I’ll be back soon. Go to the Lin family and wait for me.” Su Nantian smiled.

After Zhang Xue took Su Nantian away, Gao Shengyun gifted Lin Suyun a house. In the end, it was still the Gao family’s. Lin Suyun left in frustration, deciding to give up on Su Nantian this time.

After dealing with Wang Yanbing and Lu Zhe, Gao Shengyun trembled as he reported the situation to his superiors.

Then he collapsed into a chair.

……

Zhang Xue was delighted as she escorted Su Nantian. She also knew today the captain wasn’t here; she wanted to act first and vent her anger.

“You’re so happy, did you plan how to serve me? Foot massage, massage—those I can accept.” Su Nantian couldn’t help teasing Zhang Xue.

It was rare to find such a straightforward patrol officer who didn’t care about the Gao family. If her father knew, he’d be restless.

“Pervert. You think too much. I haven’t finished with you yet. This time, you won’t escape.” Zhang Xue waved her fist at Su Nantian.

……

Chapter 53: It’s Bigger Now, and It Shakes Too

“How could I run? You’re舍不得 me, right? Every time I see you, you’re overjoyed.” Su Nantian glanced at Zhang Xue’s front, muttering, “It seems a bit bigger than before.”

Of course, with her period, it was natural to be larger and more elastic.

“Pervert.” Zhang Xue glared at his lewd gaze, wanting to punch him.

“Buzz! Buzz!”

“What’s vibrating? Not…” Su Nantian looked at Zhang Xue’s chest, which was trembling up and down.

Zhang Xue’s face turned red instantly. She knew this guy was thinking of something extremely vulgar.

“Phone.” Zhang Xue said unenthusiastically, having rushed it into her top pocket.

It was her father’s call. She immediately turned it off.

“Who is it? Your little lover?” Su Nantian asked.

“You talk too much. This time no one can save you.” Zhang Xue said.

“Bang!”

A gunshot!

Zhang Xue immediately警觉.

“What’s going on?”

“Captain, it seems someone is robbing the bank.” The driver pointed toward the direction of the gunshot, trembling.

He had just graduated and previously only practiced shooting at targets. He’d never shot people before. Hearing the gunshot, his first thought was robbers.

“Xiao Zhang, don’t be afraid. I’ll check it out first. You immediately disperse the crowd and notify the team.”

“We’ve got a chance to catch them. This is ten times better than this pervert.”

Zhang Xue looked eager, glancing at Su Nantian with disdain.

She didn’t unlock the handcuffs but pulled Su Nantian’s hand and ran out.

Behind them, Wu Jun’s car also stopped.

“Such a fool, not even knowing the situation before rushing in.”

But he didn’t move. He stayed in the car, observing the outside.

Inside the bank.

Five men with black hoods each held a black submachine gun.

“Idiot, who told you to fire?” A burly man with a black hood raised his hand and slapped the thin man who had fired, sending him flying.

The others looked at the burly man with fear.

“Okay, Second Brother, it’s too late now. Leave before the patrol team arrives.” Another voice spoke.

“Yes, Elder Brother, it’s a shame we came here.” The burly man glanced at the thin man.

“Third Brother, Fourth Brother, move quickly. Second Brother takes a hostage.”

The elder quickly gave orders.

Second Brother scanned the area and grabbed a woman in professional attire, lifting her into his arms. Her petite body was helpless against him.

“Mommy! Mommy, let go of my mom!”

A child nearby cried loudly.

“Don’t move, I’ll come with you.” The woman pleaded desperately.

Her helpless request and sorrowful gaze made Second Brother’s body heat up.

“Good, but you must obey.” Second Brother’s eyes flashed with desire but quickly hid it. A sly smile formed on his lips.

“Everyone raise your hands! Don’t move.” Zhang Xue, with Su Nantian’s help, had already dealt with the lookout and rushed into the bank.

She held her gun in one hand, but Su Nantian’s hands were also raised. Zhang Xue was worried he’d run away, so she kept him close to ensure her peace of mind.

The robbers immediately became tense.

“Damn it, you’re alone and have a person cuffed. Are you here to joke? Put down your gun.” Second Brother aimed his gun at the woman in his arms. Thinking of the shot that had gone off earlier, he wanted to kill someone.

But luckily, only one.

Zhang Xue was stunned.

Too impulsive.

She threw down her gun and slowly raised her hands.

Looking at Su Nantian, she said apologetically: “I’m sorry! If it weren’t for my impulsive action, I wouldn’t have dragged you into this.”

“No problem. If you could confess your feelings in such a situation, I’d die content.”

Su Nantian sniffed Zhang Xue’s fragrance.

“Dream on, you still have your perverted thoughts.”

Hearing the confession, Zhang Xue’s heart beat faster than before. She hadn’t felt this nervous even when scaring the robbers.

Could she have fallen for him? Impossible, how could she like a pervert and a流氓.

“You two still have time for flirtation. Third Brother, take the gun and watch them to atone for your mistake. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of your family.”

Second Brother said unhappily. He didn’t wait for Third Brother’s agreement and led the others back.

“Evacuate.”

The elder spoke solemnly, not stopping Second Brother’s decision. Third Brother was a new recruit they had hired for backup; he knew little, so abandoning him was fine.

But before leaving, he also took the woman’s child.

“You don’t keep your word.” The woman screamed, tears in her eyes.

“Shut up!” Second Brother roared.

Third Brother didn’t argue or resist, knowing his family’s lives were in their hands.

He held the gun at them.

He deeply regretted it; if not for desperation, he wouldn’t have done this.

But he didn’t know that the five million owed was a trap.

“Looks like you’ve been abandoned,” Su Nantian smiled. He hadn’t acted because he feared the desperate robbers would harm innocent people.

He scratched his left hand.

“Don’t move.” Third Brother saw Su Nantian’s action and immediately tensed.

“Don’t be nervous, just itchy.”

He raised his left hand again but now held a silver needle.

As he spoke, the needle flew out.

In an instant, Third Brother’s eyes rolled back and fell to the ground.

“Done.” Su Nantian smiled.

“What does that have to do with you? It must be the rescue team.”

Zhang Xue frowned, turned back to look, but found nothing.

She turned around in surprise at Su Nantian.

Picking up the gun, she approached Third Brother and checked him.

A thin silver needle was inserted into his neck.

“What does that matter? Even so, you’ll never change the fact that you’re a pervert and a流氓.”

Su Nantian rubbed his nose, not arguing. He directly pried open the handcuffs.

“Where are you going?” Zhang Xue was shocked again. She had never seen such violence—directly prying open the handcuffs. It was a new alloy, and she asked immediately.

“Of course to rescue the hostages. If we’re late, we’ll miss them.”

Zhang Xue hadn’t reacted yet when Su Nantian vanished.

“Idiot, how can you rescue alone?”

Zhang Xue handed Third Brother to Xiao Zhang and immediately chased after him.

At that moment, the patrol team’s large group arrived.

Chapter 54: So Fast Already

They soon received a call from the robbers.

“You’d better not chase after us, otherwise… hehehe, you know.”

The robbers threatened and hung up.

“Captain Wu, they have hostages. What should we do?”

“Don’t act rashly yet. Let the team retrieve satellite footage, locate that car, and wait for Captain Feng.”

“But Captain Zhang has already gone after them alone.”

“Stupid woman.”

“Captain Wu, they have a jamming device. We can’t track them.”

“Damn it, then wait.”

Zhang Xue got into the car and looked around but saw no sign of Su Nantian. A bad feeling surged through her head.

Had something happened?

She immediately chased after the robbers’ direction.

At that moment, Su Nantian was sprinting rapidly along both sides of the road.

Only a blur could be seen.

He quickly closed in on the black van.

As it slowed at a turn, Su Nantian slipped under the car.

“Third Brother, did you see a shadow?” Fourth Brother asked suspiciously.

“No, Third Brother, relax. After this job, we can retire. This gain was unexpected. If it weren’t for that kid, it might have been even bigger.” Fourth Brother smiled, a slight regret.

“Fourth Brother, when did you become so easily satisfied? Have you earned enough for your baby’s formula?” Third Brother smirked, mocking.

“Ha! I want to do legitimate business and not have my child know his father is a thief.” Fourth Brother shook his head, laughing at himself. Thinking of his newborn son, he felt a sweet warmth.

“Third Brother, Fourth Brother, focus.” The elder spoke solemnly.

They immediately dropped their smiles.

“Elder Brother, that stupid woman seems to have chased after us.”

“Hmph. Let Fifth Brother lure her away and tie her up.”

The elder sneered.

The black van entered the underground garage, but when Zhang Xue turned a corner, she saw a similar black van parked in an alley.

She pulled out her gun and slowly approached.

“Ugh…”

Suddenly, a hand reached from behind and covered her mouth with a towel. She struggled but couldn’t see who it was before passing out.

A black-faced man smiled lewdly at Zhang Xue and dragged her into the car, taking her away.

“Elder Brother, she’s captured.”

“Good. Take her to the remote old parking lot in the west suburbs and lure the patrol team there. You know what to do, right?”

“Rest assured, Elder Brother.”

In the underground parking lot, a dim corner. The black van slowly stopped.

“Third Brother, Fourth Brother, you two go hide the money in the old place.”

Soon, only the elder remained with the woman and child.

“Don’t move. Your squirming makes it hard to guarantee I won’t just execute you here.” Second Brother covered the woman’s mouth with one hand while his other roamed between her breasts and hips, squeezing them firmly.

“Nice elasticity.”

He placed his hand on his nose to smell it.

“So fast already have feelings?”

Second Brother’s smile deepened.

But the next moment, his expression froze.

Feeling something unusual under him, the woman hesitated for a moment.

“Alright, you’re safe.”

A calm and warm voice came. The woman looked up and saw a figure, though the light was dim, she still felt a long-lost sense of safety.

He picked up the child who had been unconscious and cried.

“Your child is fine too. He’ll wake up in ten minutes.”

“Thank you, thank you.” The woman kept thanking.

Su Nantian threw the other two into the trunk, drove out of the parking lot.

The bright sunlight entered the car. The beautiful woman seemed reborn, turning to look at Su Nantian and was instantly captivated.

His handsome face dispelled her gloom.

“Is there something on my face?” Su Nantian asked, noticing the woman staring at him.

“No, nothing.” The woman looked away awkwardly. Her cheeks were slightly flushed.

“Alright, you can get out here. I still need to rescue someone.”

The woman saw an opportunity and immediately got out of the car, looking at the departing vehicle.

She had forgotten to get his number.

Su Nantian thought of Zhang Xue and felt郁闷. That chest-heavy woman.

She didn’t fear death!

Su Nantian woke the elder and had him call Fifth Brother.

……

“Captain Feng, it’s bad news—Zhang Xue was kidnapped by the robbers.”

Wu Jun had just received a threat call from the robbers and was already headachy. Seeing Captain Feng arrive, he immediately shifted blame.

“What? Then why are you still standing there?”

Feng Yue was startled, thinking of Zhang Xue’s father. He immediately panicked.

Soon, the patrol team’s large group arrived at the remote old parking lot in the west suburbs and surrounded it, not allowing a single mosquito to escape.

Even Feng Yue had summoned a special operations team, which was on its way.

Feng Yue, under the persuasion of others, entered the old parking lot alone.

Fifth Brother was furious; he had planned a false city strategy, but the elder’s group had failed.

Luckily, the elder was smart and left a backup plan; otherwise, there would be no chance to exchange for the elder.

When Feng Yue entered the parking lot, he immediately widened his eyes because Zhang Xue was hanging high in the air, her clothes torn and her body bound with explosives. Her mouth was stuffed, trying to say something.

“What do you want to get our people back?”

Feng Yue frowned, scanning around but found no robbers. Obviously, they were well hidden.

“Exchange our elder for him. Then send a helicopter. Otherwise, this woman won’t survive.” A speaker in the corner echoed.

“Who are you talking about? We haven’t captured your people?” Feng Yue’s frown deepened. The situation was dire.

“Hmph, don’t play dumb.” Fifth Brother’s voice trembled with anger.

“Okay, I agree.” Feng Yue immediately ordered a helicopter to be sent.

“You have the person here,” a furious voice echoed through the old parking lot.

Su Nantian led four people in from the door.

But upon seeing Zhang Xue hanging high, his eyes slightly narrowed.

Because of Wu Jun’s stubborn refusal to let go earlier, he felt a surge of killing intent again.

The parking lot was filled with an icy atmosphere.

Even Feng Yue was surprised.

“I want to see them leave.”

“Okay.” Su Nantian’s cold voice echoed. The four robbers felt chills, even Feng Yue.

The four climbed into the old car factory’s top floor. Soon, a helicopter landed.

Chapter 55: Why Is It So Heavy

“Haha, you’re done!”

“Ah!”

The speaker emitted a piercing scream.

“Mr. Su, this side is already resolved. However, the bomb has been activated.” Gao Peng’s voice echoed.

On his way back, he had called Gao Peng; otherwise, he wouldn’t have felt at ease letting them leave.

Hearing the sudden change from the speaker, Feng Yue hadn’t reacted yet.

He only felt a gust of wind pass by and saw Su Nantian’s figure appear high in the air.

He grabbed a rope, took off Zhang Xue’s bomb and placed it on himself. Just as he was about to leave, he saw the other end of the rope had a bundle of pressure explosives. Once it landed, combined with gasoline and explosives, the entire car factory would become a firestorm, collapsing instantly.

He immediately channeled his internal energy to surround Zhang Xue and hurled her toward Feng Yue.

“Tell the people outside to leave this place.”

Feng Yue, although sensing something was wrong, didn’t hesitate and extended his arms. Even if they broke, he would catch Zhang Xue.

But the next moment,
The anticipated heavy impact didn’t come. He only felt Zhang Xue was light as paper, easily catching her without the impact of a falling object from high above.

No time to think why, he turned and carried the struggling Zhang Xue out running.

Shouting for evacuation.

If Gao Qingyun saw this, he would definitely be stunned.

Externalizing internal energy, and even controlling objects with it.

A novice could only gather internal energy at the surface to enhance localized attack power, but externalizing it was rare. Only some geniuses could barely achieve it.

Externalizing and controlling with such precision was only possible for post-novice masters, each a centuries-old monster.

Flying without support was the mark of strength.
The most critical factor was the strength of one’s spiritual awareness.

To achieve this at such a young age was unimaginable.

Su Nantian saw Zhang Xue caught by Feng Yue and sighed in relief.

Although the process took only a breath, it was very exhausting. Externalizing internal energy should have been possible with his current spiritual awareness after injury, but he had overlooked one crucial point.

The weight of Zhang Xue’s body!

It exceeded his expectations.

How could a girl be so heavy? Was it because of those two on her chest?
