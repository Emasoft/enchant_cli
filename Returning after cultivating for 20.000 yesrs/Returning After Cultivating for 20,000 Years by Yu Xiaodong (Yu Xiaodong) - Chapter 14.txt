“Zhang Kun, what are you doing? Hurry up and attack him.”

Yang Yan was puzzled. Zhang Kun was the tenth on the Martial Arts Rankings; how could he have been defeated?

“Do you want to try as well?” Su Nantian’s eyes turned icy as he gazed at Yang Yan.

Chapter 60: Teahouse Owner

Yang Yan felt a chill run up his spine, as if stalked by a wild beast. His entire body was numb with fear, and his hair stood on end.

“Do you know who I am?”

Yang Yan was frightened. Though he didn’t understand what had happened to Zhang Kun, the look in his eyes told him that Zhang Kun was not faking it.

Yang Yan had seen Zhang Kun training. Not even bloodied flesh made him flinch; as long as his bones weren’t broken, he kept training.

He couldn’t imagine the pain that had made Zhang Kun beg for mercy on his knees.

But he couldn’t kneel. Once he did, it would soon be known at Fengyue University. Then where would his face be?

He thought of his towering father, and straightened his back. Though he lacked the talent to become a martial artist, his father was an esteemed master.

That was why Zhang Kun followed him like a shadow and obeyed so well.

Wu Lianxing was stunned. Seeing Su Nantian about to attack Yang Yan, she rushed forward and grabbed his hand, pleading: “Su Nantian, let it go. Yang Yan has a strong background; don’t provoke him.”

“Background?” Su Nantian curled his lips. He loved beating those with status—might was might, and background meant nothing.

“Haha, you’re scared, aren’t you? My father is Master Yang Dali, who could punch a black bear to death. If you dare harm even one hair of mine, I’ll make your life a living hell.” Yang Yan felt his confidence return, as if his father stood beside him, giving him infinite strength.

“Don’t worry about me. I’m eager to see just how strong your father is.” Su Nantian pushed Wu Lianxing’s hand away again.

Wu Lianxing didn’t believe Su Nantian was a master either, but those deep eyes gave her the feeling that even a master wouldn’t stand a chance.

Yang Yan’s eyes flashed with fire at this scene.

“I’ve changed my mind. Cut off one of your hands and buy your life.”

“Such useless talk. You’ll be on your knees soon enough.”

Su Nantian stepped forward and tapped Yang Yan’s forehead. Then he grinned, stomping on his foot. The front half of the foot turned into a sheet of paper with no thickness at all.

Yang Yan was about to mock him further when his face changed. He didn’t even let out a scream before passing out.

“Is he okay?” Wu Lianxing asked anxiously, leaning over Yang Yan who lay on the ground.

If Yang Yan died, Su Nantian would be in trouble.

“He’s not dead yet,” Su Nantian tapped Zhang Kun’s forehead. “You’d better take him to the hospital quickly; it’ll be too late otherwise.”

Zhang Kun was relieved and carried Yang Yan away in a hurry.

At that moment, the security guards were all too terrified to move and scattered immediately.

“Stop!” A deep voice echoed from the teahouse. The guards halted instantly and formed a line.

A middle-aged man in a traditional Chinese robe stepped out of the teahouse, smiling: “Miss Wu, sir, my staff was rude and failed to welcome you properly. Please forgive us.”

“Take the month’s salary, all of you—leave.” He turned to the guards and said sternly.

The other eight security guards were annoyed but dared not say a word; they wouldn’t get their pay otherwise.

“Mr. Guo, this is my friend. Please don’t mistake him next time,” Wu Lianxing said angrily.

“Of course, sir. I’m truly sorry for the incident. All your tea consumption here will be free of charge,” Guo Chaoxu bowed in apology, handing her a green card.

Wu Lianxing was surprised. She hadn’t expected Mr. Guo to be so formal, giving her a card she’d never seen before and offering free tea. What did that mean? Here, the most expensive cup of tea could cost tens of thousands, and top-grade tea was priced at hundreds of thousands per gram.

She didn’t understand why Mr. Guo had given such a generous gift.

But Su Nantian understood perfectly. He wasn’t surprised by Mr. Guo’s behavior because the teahouse had a cultivator who had sensed his slight aura.

“Alright, I’ll accept your kindness,” Su Nantian took the green card and casually tucked it into his pocket without even glancing at it.

“Sir, please come inside,” Guo Chaoxu felt a weight lift from his heart. He recalled the guest sent by the teahouse’s headquarters who said this man was also a cultivator and stronger than him.

He was terrified. Any cultivator wasn’t someone he could provoke, especially one so powerful.

He must make friends with him.

“Wait, Su Nantian, why aren’t you wearing shoes?” Wu Lianxing looked at his bare feet.

“Ah… well…” Su Nantian rubbed his nose, unable to think of an excuse immediately.

“No problem, sir. I’ll go buy you a pair,” Guo Chaoxu said quickly. “You and my daughter should go inside to rest.”

“Great, then leave it to you,” Su Nantian seized the opportunity and said.

“Let’s continue what we started earlier.”

He walked inside without explaining. Wu Lianxing followed behind, finding the situation increasingly intriguing.

“Two of you, please go upstairs. There are private rooms with absolute silence,” Guo Chaoxu led the way personally.

“By the way, Mr. Guo, bring the zither I left here into the private room,” Wu Lianxing suddenly said.

“Of course, Miss Wu.” Guo Chaoxu bowed slightly and treated Wu Lianxing with more respect.

“By the way, bring a pot of Anxi Tieguanyin,” Wu Lianxing said as she saw Guo Chaoxu’s respectful attitude. Remembering what she had intended to say about free tea, she added.

“Please wait a moment.”

He then left.

They entered the private room.

Su Nantian said nothing but shook his head slightly.

“I told you, the tea here is quite good. If you don’t try it, wouldn’t that be a waste of your visit?” Wu Lianxing smiled.

“You’re quite generous,” Su Nantian smiled back.

“Of course. Later, I’ll ask you to guide me; naturally, I should treat you to the most expensive tea. Hehe, since your tea is free, it’s a good chance for me to take advantage of your generosity. I rarely drink such expensive tea normally.”

Wu Lianxing smiled awkwardly, realizing her small trick had been seen through.

Soon after, a beautiful woman in a cheongsam entered and carefully placed the tea set on the table.

Her teapouring was skillful, graceful, and flowing—pleasing to the eye.

Behind her came two people who carried the zither in and quietly left without making a sound.

After they had tea, Su Nantian signaled the cheongsam woman to leave.
