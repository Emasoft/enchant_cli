Just as Su Nantian lifted his gaze, he locked eyes with his aunt's boyfriend. His lips curled upward, deepening his smile.

Hmph, it truly is a chance encounter. That fellow was... Zhang Bao!

Zhang Bao spotted Su Nantian as well, his gaze flickering before he instinctively shivered. Upon hearing the surrounding people's words, he immediately grasped the situation.

His eyes gleamed slightly as Zhang Bao turned his thoughts, then strode toward Su Nantian.

Wu You'er saw the man approaching and her expression suddenly tensed. She instinctively hid behind Su Nantian, pouting with a face full of委屈, and whispered cautiously: "Tian Ge, he... he's coming toward us?"

"Rest easy. I'm here; he won't dare to cause trouble again."

Shi Tiantian frowned, and the surrounding people were equally surprised by why Zhang Bao was approaching Su Nantian. Unexpectedly, Zhang Bao bowed and said: "Tian Ge!"

Tian Ge?

That single word, coupled with the gesture, left everyone gaping in disbelief.

Su Nantian remained expressionless and said nothing.

Zhang Bao straightened up: "What happened yesterday was my mistake. I will definitely give Tian Ge a satisfactory resolution."

At that moment, Su Nantian gave a slight nod.

Shi Tiantian frowned and said with disdain: "Zhang Bao, do you know him? It's unnecessary to waste time on such a person. Unexpectedly appearing as a poor relative, even the car is rented—this is truly embarrassing."

After saying that, Shi Tiantian laughed freely. However, Zhang Bao's face darkened: "What are you talking about? Tian Ge is the company boss. Why can't he drive it?"

Shi Tiantian laughed as if hearing a great joke: "Zhang Bao, are you joking? This company is yours."

Zhang Bao shook his head: "Tian Ge is the big boss."

Chapter 352: Assistance

Tian Ge, the boss?

Fufa Financial Company had many good cars, worth at least tens of millions. Su Nantian didn't look like a rich person—how could he be the big boss?

Wu You'er pouted: "Hmph, I told you this car is Tian Ge's. You still didn't believe me."

Seeing Zhang Bao so humbly speaking to Su Nantian, the others fell silent, fearing they might offend Zhang Bao.

Who would dare look down on Su Nantian now? Who would dare mock him in front of Zhang Bao?

It turned out he wasn't arguing—it was simply disdain. He didn't consider them worth his time.

Unbeknownst to Su Nantian, he was slightly stunned. He glanced at Zhang Bao again; this man truly knew how to handle people.

Su Nantian spoke calmly: "Today's incident, I've noted it. However, the resolution you give me must be complete."

Zhang Bao nodded repeatedly: "I guarantee to give Tian Ge a satisfactory resolution."

Shi Tiantian glared at Su Nantian several times, then pulled Zhang Bao to enter the villa, saying she wanted to introduce him to her parents—the maternal uncle of Wu You'er. However, Zhang Bao directly refused: "Tian Ge is still outside; what qualification do I have to enter?"

Stamping her foot, Shi Tiantian hated Su Nantian. She had planned to show off in front of everyone today, but now it was all taken by him.

Shi Tiantian reluctantly invited Su Nantian into the villa, but inwardly she sneered.

Not wanting to enter? Wait and see how Su Nantian embarrasses himself. Did he think anyone could just walk in here?

When the others realized, Su Nantian had already followed Zhang Bao into the house. Wu You'er remained outside.

Those who had previously mocked her now approached Wu You'er, and she lifted her head proudly: "I said the car was bought by my brother. Now do you believe me?"

For a long time, she had no status at all, sometimes even lacking the most basic respect. Wu You'er suddenly felt a sense of triumph.

Stepping into the house, Su Nantian furrowed his brows and his smile faded.

Inside were all elders seated on the sofa. However, Wu Tao's couple stood behind the sofa without even a chair, looking very embarrassed and awkwardly watching their maternal uncle and others chat.

This was what they called family?

To despise people like this? It was truly humiliating and face-ripping.

Looking around, one might think Wu Tao's couple were servants coming to serve tea and water.

Then looking at the sofa, there was still an empty seat. Why not let them sit?

Truly powerless and without influence, wherever they went, people looked down on them.

Shi Tiantian pulled Zhang Bao forward and said: "Dad, this is my boyfriend, Zhang Bao."

Zhang Bao nodded in greeting. Shi Yunlan knew of Zhang Bao's reputation—his family, the Hangcheng Zhang clan, was a person with status. He didn't pay attention to etiquette.

Shi Tiantian then pulled Zhang Bao around, continuously introducing him to the family. When passing by Wu Tao's couple, she deliberately ignored them without a word—purely blatant contempt.

Su Nantian observed this and his eyes narrowed, flickering with tiny sparks of light.

Shi Yunlan knew Zhang Bao was thriving in Hangcheng. After they finished meeting relatives, he quickly stood up and said: "Come, sit down."

Zhang Bao was about to sit when Su Nantian suddenly walked over to Wu Tao's couple and called out: "Uncle, Aunt."

Shi Yunlan immediately frowned and turned to glare at Su Nantian, scolding: "Here are all the elders. Why is a junior like you coming in? Go out, no manners at all—what kind of decorum is this?"

Everyone laughed, scrutinizing Su Nantian with contempt. Shi Tiantian's face was full of smugness.

Such treatment had only one reason: the Wu family was too poor, a typical poor relative.

"What kind of elders have what kind of juniors. A family with no achievements."

"Interrupting the elders' speech—unmannered."

The crowd muttered criticisms against Su Nantian, even Wu Tao's couple weren't spared.

Shi Yunlan again invited Zhang Bao to sit, but was surprised when Zhang Bao refused: "Tian Ge hasn't sat down yet; where would I dare to sit?"

After saying that, he personally bowed deeply to Wu Tao's couple and apologized: "That day was my mistake. Please forgive me, Uncle and Aunt."

Wu Tao's couple exchanged glances then looked at Su Nantian. Su Nantian helplessly shrugged his hands, and Shi Ruo nodded slightly.

Shi Yunlan raised an eyebrow and said coldly: "Bring two chairs over." Sitting on the chair was only out of respect for Zhang Bao.

The servants brought the chairs over. Wu Tao's couple were about to sit when Su Nantian stopped them. He didn't care about anyone's gaze, took their hands with calluses and sat them on the sofa: "Uncle, Aunt, sit here. You have this qualification."

Su Nantian glanced around: "You wanted qualifications? Alright, I'll show you my qualification."

"Kid, do you have any sense of hierarchy?" someone scolded on Shi Yunlan's behalf, trying to please.

Su Nantian coldly smiled: "Hmph. Respect? Have you ever respected my elders? Reflect on yourselves—how have you treated them over the years?"

Shi Ruo stood up to mediate: "Calm down, the child is young and doesn't know better. Everyone should be more tolerant."

But before she finished speaking, a fat-headed middle-aged man coldly said: "Shut up. Who are you to speak?"

Daring to be so disrespectful in front of him, how could Su Nantian tolerate it?

Instantly anger surged. He rushed toward the man and punched him, drawing blood from his nose.

If he hadn't held back, that punch would have killed the man instantly.

The fat-eared man clutched his nose and howled: "You little brat, do you think I'll let you leave today?"

Wu Tao rushed forward to wipe the blood off the man's face: "You're magnanimous; don't take it personally with this child..."

The man spat blood onto Wu Tao's face: "Get lost. You're all no good, poor bastards."

Hearing this, Su Nantian's anger that had just cooled down flared up again. He wanted to rush forward and hit the man, but was held back by Shi Ruo.

Zhang Bao coldly glanced at the fat-eared man: "If you oppose Tian Ge, it's a slap in my face. I'll see who dares to keep Tian Ge from leaving."

The words fell, and the whole room fell silent. Shi Tiantian was stunned; she had never seen Zhang Bao help someone like this.

In fact, it wasn't really helping—more like a younger brother seeing his older brother being bullied.

Shi Yunlan had originally wanted to ask Zhang Bao for a favor. How could he let this ruin it?

To stabilize Zhang Bao, Shi Yunlan immediately smiled and gestured for Wu Tao's couple to sit down. Then he said to Su Nantian: "Big nephew, don't be angry. Let's have a meal together. It's been a long time since we've gathered as family. Why make everyone unhappy?"

Changing faces like flipping a page, he had previously scolded Su Nantian but now smiled and flattered.

People compared to each other, it's the difference that kills. This was the gap.

Everyone feared Shi Yunlan's power and didn't dare to speak further. None of them expected this poor kid to know Zhang Bao...

Chapter 353: Blackmail

Wu Tao's couple sat down. People nearby began to chat with them, their attitude changed rapidly. Several people even came over for casual conversation.

For many years, the Wu family had been looked down upon and mocked. Now they received at least basic respect from others, greatly satisfying Wu Tao and Shi Ruo's vanity.

Su Nantian didn't insist on causing trouble. As long as Wu Tao's couple were happy, the rest was irrelevant.

As for the fat-eared man, he remained resentful and glared at Su Nantian with venomous eyes, gritting his teeth as if waiting for a chance to teach Su Nantian a lesson.

After finishing the meal at Shi Yunlan's house, everyone left one by one.

Zhang Bao stayed behind and personally escorted Su Nantian's family out of the door, giving them full respect.

After returning home, Wu You'er chattered nonstop. Her parents also smiled broadly.

After watching TV for a while, Su Nantian went to bed.

No words were spoken that night.

The next morning, Wu Tao's couple and Wu You'er went out.

After Su Nantian finished washing up, he prepared to go out and buy something. However, as soon as he opened the door, he saw Zhang Bao raising his hand to knock.

"Hmm?" Su Nantian furrowed his brow. What did he come for this time?

"Ah... Tian Ge..." Zhang Bao chuckled and scratched his head.

Previously, he had called him "Tian Ge" at Shi Yunlan's house—helping out. Now, coming again and still calling him "Tian Ge"—this was quite intriguing.

"What's the matter?" Su Nantian raised an eyebrow.

Zhang Bao glanced into the house, smiling awkwardly. This confused Su Nantian, so he let the man sit down.

Zhang Bao then took out a document from his bag and handed it to Su Nantian: "This is the share transfer agreement of Fufa Financial Company. Please accept it, Tian Ge."

Oh? Playing for real?

Su Nantian smiled. Zhang Bao's move made him more certain that there was definitely something else: "No reward without effort."

"Rest assured, Tian Ge. From now on, Yang Xiao will no longer appear before you. Plus the company transfer agreement—do you find this resolution satisfactory?" Zhang Bao insisted that Su Nantian accept and sign it.

His eyes flickered twice, his smile deepened. Su Nantian leaned back on the sofa, crossed his legs, and was quite satisfied with Zhang Bao's resolution.

But this company transfer was a huge gesture. Not to mention those good cars, the company's annual revenue alone would be a large sum. To give it so easily?

"Speak up, what do you need from me?" Su Nantian lit a cigarette and didn't offer it to Zhang Bao, instead smoking it himself while his fingers lightly tapped the sofa arm.

Meeting his gaze, Zhang Bao felt as if his soul was pierced. Especially those flickers of light in the eyes, giving a sense of airiness—like one's inner thoughts couldn't escape his gaze.

Unbeknownst to Su Nantian, he had encountered many old foxes. This small trick from Zhang Bao wouldn't fool him. If it wasn't for a favor, why would he let such a big bait fall?

Not giving up the child to catch the wolf...

Zhang Bao hesitated for a moment, then gritted his teeth: "To be honest, I've had some trouble recently. Please help me, Tian Ge..."

He left it half-said, waiting for Su Nantian to respond. But he still smiled without speaking.

Reluctantly, Zhang Bao chuckled awkwardly: "I hope Tian Ge can help me once. My enemy Han Ji has hired a master to take my life."

Su Nantian understood. Zhang Bao clearly saw his strength, but upon reflection, helping once would get the company transfer agreement. This way, he could ensure Wu Tao's couple wouldn't worry.

Zhang Bao continued: "In fact, I've asked others before. But upon hearing the enemy's name, they all made various excuses to refuse. That's why I came to ask for your help."

Su Nantian said nothing, weighing the pros and cons in his mind.

Once he got involved, he would be entangled with Zhang Bao's matters. He feared it might be hard to extricate himself.

But the benefits were also there—Fufa Financial Company's shares.

He didn't really care about this small amount of money, but what about Wu Tao's couple and Wu You'er? No matter how detached he was, he had to let the Wu family rise.

He extinguished the cigarette and took the share transfer agreement, scanning it to confirm there were no errors. Then he picked up a pen and signed his name: "I'll protect your life, just once. For me, this is a deal."

Zhang Bao was overjoyed and nodded repeatedly: "Han Ji has already issued a challenge. The time is tonight at 8 o'clock, the location is Hangcheng Central Park. He said if I don't go, he'll come to me. I'm not afraid, but my subordinates will suffer."

Su Nantian waved his hand: "You can go. Your quarrel has nothing to do with me. I'll be there at 8 o'clock."

Zhang Bao chuckled and said no more, stood up with the transfer agreement and left. But he still left a copy for Su Nantian.

After Zhang Bao left, Su Nantian checked the time and went out for breakfast. He drove to Fufa Financial Company, today was also the day to return the car.

Although the company now belonged to him, the subordinates didn't know yet. He had to go and greet them.

Su Nantian followed the navigation to drive his car to Fufa Financial Company. Upon arriving at the parking lot, a manager came forward to check the vehicle's condition.

The large parking lot had only Su Nantian and Manager Jiang, making it unusually quiet.

Manager Jiang was the one who had received him before.

After parking the car, Su Nantian intended to go to the lobby to talk with the manager. As he was about to leave, he heard Manager Jiang calling out behind him.

Su Nantian turned around and met Manager Jiang's gaze, but this time his demeanor was different from before. Instead of humility, it was arrogance.

"Wait..."

"What?"

"You come over and look at this. There's a problem."

Problem?

He had only driven it out for a few days, and he didn't recall any accidents. Where was the problem?

Su Nantian walked back to his car and saw a long black scratch on the rear. It was very obvious.

He vaguely remembered that this scratch had already existed, and he didn't believe Manager Jiang was unaware. If so, there must be something fishy.

Suspecting it was him? Impossible. Looking at Manager Jiang's arrogant demeanor, it was clearly trying to frame him—this was the classic blackmail.

Manager Jiang saw Su Nantian remained silent and mistakenly thought he was unaware of the matter. He felt secretly happy.

"Before, this scratch already existed. What does it have to do with me?" Su Nantian frowned.

Manager Jiang's expression was slightly embarrassed but he remained calm: "This is how you caused it after taking the car. We have records here."

Saying that, he opened the documents in his hand and handed them to Su Nantian. Documents? They could be forged anyway. Su Nantian realized the purpose was to get money from him, even getting it from the boss.

"Look, it's clearly written in black and white. It'll take at least 50,000 to settle." Manager Jiang pointed to the lines on the document.

This was truly a big mouth. Su Nantian coldly waved his hand and "popped" the document onto the ground.

Chapter 354: New Boss?

If this mode of operation continued, how long could the company last? It would eventually collapse.

Su Nantian laughed coldly: "Call over the manager. I'll see today whether this is Fufa Financial Company or a fraud."

Manager Jiang looked indifferent: "No use. You still have to pay, no escape."

"Is that so?" Su Nantian's lips curled slightly. He turned to go into the lobby.

But Manager Jiang whistled, and suddenly twenty or thirty hooligans emerged from behind the cars. They were dark and oppressive, each holding a stick, ready to attack.

Looking at their demeanor, they waved their sticks with an extremely contemptuous expression.

"Cheh. Pretending to be big shot, if you don't have ability, won't let this trash run away and dodge payment?" Manager Jiang smiled with a sinister expression: "Today, if you don't pay the money, I'll break your legs to settle."

"Hey, did you prepare it in advance?" Su Nantian didn't get angry but smiled: "Want money, right? I'll give it."

He wanted to see who else was in cahoots with Manager Jiang within the company. If even the top managers were like this, he definitely needed to talk with Zhang Bao.

"Hey, I thought you were tough. But even when you see the coffin, you still cry." Manager Jiang led the way into the lobby.

It was lunch break. Entering the lobby, there were few people. The cashier counter had a girl sitting on duty.

Hearing the noise, she looked up and saw Manager Jiang. Her lips immediately smiled, glanced at Su Nantian behind her and said: "Another order? I wonder how much I can get this time?"

Manager Jiang approached, coughed twice and pinched her face. He smiled and said she wouldn't be shortchanged. At night, he would distribute it to her at his home. Seeing this girl pouted and said "bad guy."

Manager Jiang glanced at Su Nantian: "Hurry up, give the money."

Su Nantian had already seen through everything. These two were clearly a big trap, and it wasn't just him they targeted. How could such people be managers? At this time, they were still asking for money from him—this was really sticking their heads up.

"Come on, give me the money."

Saying that, Su Nantian took a step forward. His smiling face looked harmless but suddenly grabbed Manager Jiang and slapped him across the face.

He acted quickly, turning over faster than flipping a page. The cashier girl was startled and screamed, drawing the hooligans outside.

Manager Jiang winced in pain: "Damn it, you little brat. All of you get him, break his legs to settle."

"Money no, but I have one life. See if you have the ability." Su Nantian coldly smiled.

"Damn it, why talk to him? Get him!" Manager Jiang growled.

Everyone rushed forward with their sticks. They came in a storm, but to him they were still fake skills.

One man rushed forward and tried to hit with a stick. At the moment it touched his hair, he stopped. The hooligan was surprised.

Su Nantian grabbed the stick and kicked the man several meters away. The man fell to the ground with a thud, holding his trembling body and groaning in pain.

Everyone saw Su Nantian's great strength and became cautious, their actions becoming hesitant.

"Get him all!" Manager Jiang endured the pain and shouted.

Under Manager Jiang's urging, the hooligans hesitated but came forward. Su Nantian grabbed the stick he had just taken from the man and with lightning speed knocked down the approaching hooligans.

They were definitely not on the same level. Suddenly, it was quiet.

Manager Jiang became desperate and shouted: "50,000. Whoever breaks this bastard's legs gets it."

Thinking that more people could get rid of Su Nantian?

Finally, under the temptation of money, several people gathered courage to approach. The cashier girl had already called for security from the intercom and immediately surrounded Su Nantian.

It was clear these people were Zhang Bao's subordinates stationed here.

Manager Jiang, after rubbing his face and regaining composure, felt more arrogant with the help arriving. He directly pointed at Su Nantian and scolded: "Don't you dare to mess with me here?"

"My place, I'm afraid of it?" Su Nantian shrugged indifferently.

Everyone laughed. The cashier girl even said mockingly: "If you're the boss here, I'm the mistress. Haha!"

Manager Jiang laughed so hard he almost fell over: "I am his father."

Then his face turned cold and growled at people to finish off Su Nantian. The security guards didn't say anything, and were about to act when a stout man came in from outside. He asked Manager Jiang what they were doing.

Manager Jiang quickly covered his face and flattered: "Niu Ge, no problem. This scumbag scratched the car but didn't pay and even hit people, injuring several brothers."

Niu Ge looked at Su Nantian and then went upstairs: "Don't make a big deal."

"Leave it to me, Niu Ge." Manager Jiang sneered and took the stick from his subordinates to personally teach this so-called "scumbag."

"What do you mean, Niu Ge?" Su Nantian coldly laughed twice but saw that Niu Ge didn't even acknowledge him and was about to leave: "It seems what Zhang Bao said is just nonsense, not valid."

Niu Ge furrowed his brows and turned around: "What do you mean by that?"

Su Nantian directly took out the company's share transfer agreement and threw it to Niu Ge: "Look carefully."

Niu Ge took the agreement, opened it and his face changed from calm to surprised.

Everyone couldn't figure out Niu Ge's expression, so they just waited quietly nearby.

Those close to him saw the crumpled paper with several prominent big characters "Fufa Financial Company Share Transfer Agreement" and were puzzled. Could the company really belong to Su Nantian?

Niu Ge saw Zhang Bao's signature and was shocked. This was indeed Zhang Bao's handwriting.

Even if this handwriting was Zhang Bao's, Niu Ge still didn't believe it. However, his attitude toward Su Nantian improved somewhat. After all, such a big company couldn't be given away so easily.

"Master Tian, forgive my impertinence. What's your relationship with Bao Ge?"

Manager Jiang's face changed immediately, sensing something was wrong. He might have gotten into trouble this time. He felt uneasy.

Su Nantian didn't waste words and directly took out his phone to call Zhang Bao.

"Zhang Bao, are your words nonsense or what? Your people don't believe I'm the company boss. You tell them clearly yourself."

After saying that, he handed the phone to Niu Ge.

"Hello, Bao Ge?" Niu Ge cautiously asked.

A familiar scolding came from the phone: "Niu Meng, you have no sense. Fool."

This voice scared Niu Meng and he was startled. Su Nantian truly was the company boss.

Even if others were dull, they should know Su Nantian's words were true. They all lowered their heads.

The cashier girl was even more terrified, her mouth wide open like an egg.

Manager Jiang saw this and slowly moved his steps outward...

Chapter 355: Proper Handling

After Niu Meng heard the phone hang up, he timidly held the phone and returned it to Su Nantian.

"Master Tian, please go upstairs first. I'll come after finishing the matter."

Su Nantian didn't move, and coldly smiled: "Then how do you handle the issue of the scratched car?"

At this moment, Niu Meng still didn't understand. How could Su Nantian scratch the car and then refuse to pay?

The entire company was his. Not only that, but even if he smashed the car, what could it do?

Manager Jiang heard this and his fear escalated rapidly. His whole body trembled.

Niu Meng's face turned cold, looking at Manager Jiang and thinking this man had offended the new boss. This was like walking into a gun's mouth.

Manager Jiang looked terrified, still hoping Su Nantian would forgive him. But Su Nantian was definitely not someone who could be easily spoken to.

The world had many things that money could buy, but none could buy regret or time...

Niu Meng knew Su Nantian wouldn't let it go easily. To please, he had to be ruthless.

Manager Jiang quickly begged: "Niu Ge, I'm sorry. This time let me off. From now on... I'll definitely work hard..."

"Next time?"

Su Nantian was unpleased and asked again, then pointed at the trembling cashier girl: "And you too. Pack your things and leave quickly. If it weren't for me not beating women..."

Everyone was afraid, their eyes darting around. Niu Meng waved his hand and the security guards rushed forward to subdue Manager Jiang's group.

Niu Meng's eyes were cold: "Break their legs."

One command, and the lobby was filled with screams of pain. It was too late.

Su Nantian silently watched without saying a word. Niu Meng approached: "Master Tian, please go upstairs to rest. I'll handle this."

Su Nantian nodded and was about to go up when suddenly, Manager Jiang fell to his knees: "Master Tian, it's my mistake. I've offended you. Please forgive me."

Saying that, Manager Jiang tried to grab Su Nantian's leg but was kicked away by Niu Meng.

Manager Jiang, stunned by the sudden kick, fell into endless despair.

The kicked Manager Jiang groaned in pain. Niu Meng found the pitiful sight of Manager Jiang annoying and, with Su Nantian present, couldn't be careless.

"Still standing there? Break his leg."

Hearing this, the security guards dragged Manager Jiang out. The cashier girl finally regained her composure and sat on the ground.

"Master Tian, please forgive me. I have old people and children at home. My wife only drinks and plays around, with several mouths depending on me."

Su Nantian coldly snorted and then went upstairs without looking back. This person deserved the punishment.

Pity?

Deserved, not worth it.

Su Nantian was in the office. He looked around at the large office, with many antiques on the desk and "Great Luck" hanging on the wall.

Pounding.

A knock came, and through the transparent glass door, Su Nantian saw a sweet-looking secretary bringing tea in.

"Master Tian, hello. I'm Niu Meng's secretary. This is premium Longjing tea. Please enjoy it. If you need anything, just call me."

Su Nantian nodded and the beauty placed the tea before leaving.

Su Nantian sipped the tea, hearing no more noise downstairs. He assumed the matter was handled.

Within minutes, Niu Meng came upstairs with an apologetic look toward Su Nantian.

"Master Tian, I'm really sorry. Please rest assured; there won't be a next time."

Su Nantian nodded and took a sip of tea: "The company's business is still entirely under you. I don't want to get involved now."

He hadn't intended to take over the company, all for Wu's family. He wasn't suited for managing it. Through Niu Meng's reaction, he was likely unaware but there might be negligence.

If Niu Meng had any ulterior motives toward the company, he would definitely make this man suffer.

Niu Meng heard that and was overjoyed. He nodded repeatedly, secretly relieved he had been cautious and hadn't acted recklessly; otherwise, Manager Jiang would have been the best example.

"But if I hear about this again in the future, you won't do it either."

"Master Tian, it's my negligence. If there is a next time, I'll pack and leave myself without you having to say it."

Su Nantian nodded: "Then I'll go first. Remember, don't bother me with anything important."

"Ah, Master Tian, I'll send you off."

Su Nantian didn't refuse. Niu Meng smiled all the way.

Niu Meng handed over a business card: "Master Tian, this is my phone number. Please call me if you have any instructions."

Su Nantian was about to drive the Mercedes but was stopped by Niu Meng: "This car was already scratched. How about driving a new Porsche from the company?" Saying that, he didn't wait for Su Nantian's agreement and directly handed over the keys.

Niu Meng smiled twice, then ran back to the lobby. He looked like he was afraid of being refused.

Shaking his head, Su Nantian still wanted to drive the Mercedes. His phone rang at the same time.

Ding...

It was Wu You'er calling, telling him to hurry to Hangcheng Central Park because she had a surprise.

Looking at Niu Meng, he was already gone. Su Nantian could only sigh and shake his head. This new Porsche would have to do for now.

After hanging up, he navigated to Hangcheng Central Park. Although it was autumn, the weather felt like early summer—warm with a touch of heat.

Su Nantian drove carelessly, wondering what surprise this girl had that she needed to tell him in person.

"Vroom..."

A brand new Porsche sped by, causing pedestrians and vehicles to talk about it.

Upon arriving at Hangcheng Central Park, the weather was clear. The sun had already dispelled the morning's gloom. As evening approached, flowers were in full bloom, and most people had already left. Su Nantian parked the car.

Looking around, under the dim streetlights, he could see Wu You'er and a well-built woman chatting happily.

Wu You'er turned around and saw Su Nantian. She was excited and hurriedly called him over.

As he approached, he saw the woman's true face. Her face was exquisite, her figure outstanding. Even with an over-the-knee windbreaker on, it still revealed a火爆 body and exposed her long legs.

"Hey, Tian Ge, what are you staring at?" Wu You'er teased.

Su Nantian finally came to his senses: "Girl, what's in your bag?"

Wu You'er pushed Su Nantian forward and almost had a close encounter with the beautiful woman.

He just steadied himself when Wu You'er laughed and left, saying meaningfully: "Tian Ge, I'll introduce you to a good friend. I can only do this much. The rest is up to you." Then she stuck out her tongue at Su Nantian.

A good friend?

Su Nantian was stunned. He didn't know this woman, and it was their first meeting. Where did the good friend come from? This girl was really unreliable.

This woman's name was Wen Ran. Her family was wealthy, and she was the daughter of the Hangcheng Wen clan. Su Nantian didn't understand why Wu You'er introduced her to him.

Chapter 356: Making an Entrance

Both remained silent. Wen Ran broke the silence and asked cautiously: "That, Lianxing has been doing well?"

She was an old friend of Wu Lianxing? Did she want to know some information about Wu Lianxing from him?

Su Nantian was puzzled and hesitated a moment before answering: "Fine."

Three simple words, Wen Ran felt the evasiveness. Her anger arose, and tears glistened in her eyes.

Su Nantian was startled and didn't know what to do. He could only awkwardly smile.

He didn't know what had happened between Wen Ran and Wu Lianxing. It was likely just a good friend who hadn't seen each other for years and missed her.

He wanted to approach Wen Ran to comfort her, but his hand had just touched her shoulder when a punch greeted him. He realized it and didn't even feel the pain, then rushed to protect her.

Wen Ran finally realized it. She looked up and shouted: "Brother, are you crazy?"

The one who had punched was Wen Liang, her brother.

Wen Liang ignored him but pointed at Su Nantian: "Who are you? Daring to touch my sister?"

Su Nantian coldly snorted and said nothing. But Wen Liang took it as an opportunity: "Look at your poor appearance. No money and still want to flirt with my sister? Dream on."

Su Nantian coldly said: "I can only warn you not to underestimate anyone."

"Hmph. What's the use? Even if a fish翻身, it's still a fish."

Wen Liang was extremely contemptuous. Saying that, he wanted to take Wen Ran away. She suddenly broke free and ran to Su Nantian's side.

Su Nantian naturally couldn't bear it. He suddenly kicked, but Wen Ran stopped him.

"Wen Liang, don't be too much." Wen Ran shouted.

"Wen Ran, you don't forget what's coming up..."

"My business doesn't need your concern."

Wen Liang hadn't finished speaking when Wen Ran interrupted him. She was helpless and had to get up and leave. If she hadn't accidentally learned that Su Nantian had information about Wu Lianxing, she wouldn't have acted recklessly.

Wen Ran slowly took out an invitation from her bag and handed it to Su Nantian: "This is my wedding invitation. It's in eight days. Since we've met, please come to be a witness."

After saying that, Wen Ran walked away. Her heart was very conflicted. After walking a few steps, she stopped and looked back but said nothing.

Two minutes later, Su Nantian saw a figure running toward him. He didn't need to think twice—knowing it was Wu You'er.

"Master Tian, Wen Ran said she's getting married. Do you know?" Wu You'er panted.

"Yes."

The girl was greedy: "She said the person she doesn't like. Since you're so capable, help her out."

Su Nantian's head ached. It seemed Wu You'er had brought him here for this reason. He gritted his teeth and said: "Don't interfere, I have my own way to handle it."

Wu You'er said confidently: "Master Tian, I knew you definitely had a way. Hurry up and find her back. I support you!"

After saying that, she made a gesture to encourage: "Master Tian, hurry up. I've made plans with my classmates, so I'll go first."

Su Nantian had no way to deal with this kind-hearted little sister. He helplessly shook his head.

He didn't plan to leave, so he sat on a long bench and smoked. The ground was already piled with cigarette butts.

Looking around, only dim streetlights remained, barely visible.

Buzz!

After a series of roaring sounds, Su Nantian saw several cars parked by the park's roadside. A group of people were gathering in the open grassy area.

Su Nantian looked at that group, but it was too dark to see who they were. He thought the one coming to Hangcheng Central Park at this time was either Zhang Bao or that Han Ji person. He decided to observe quietly.

"Mo Ge, there's someone."

Mo Ge coldly glanced at the direction the person pointed and said dismissively: "Take a few people to deal with it."

The man heard that and took several hooligans toward Su Nantian, intending to drive him away.
