Su Nantian merely sneered at Lu Jiajun's words. When he called out to Dean Zhou, Su Nantian suddenly recalled a person. This Dean Zhou was likely the old man who had once taken him in as a disciple, wasn't it?

What Zhou Qing said over the phone was inaudible to Su Nantian. Yet, there was no need for him to hear it—he could easily guess its content. It must have been filled with fury.

After all, in Su Nantian's mind, Zhou Qing was a very dedicated and responsible dean with an unwavering pursuit of medical mastery.

Not long after, Zhou Qing indeed arrived at the hospital room wearing a white coat.

"What's going on? Who caused this disturbance here?"

As Zhou Qing pushed open the door, he asked this question and immediately spotted Su Nantian standing there with a faint smile.

"Ah, Mr. Su has come to visit. Although it's not the best way to say it here in a hospital, I'm genuinely pleased."

Zhou Qing's impression of Su Nantian was deeply etched. He marveled at the mysterious medical skills that defied comprehension, and to this day he still hadn't unraveled their principles. Just this alone was enough to earn Su Nantian his respect.

Moreover, this enigmatic youth had healed both the daughter of the Gao family and Old Lin. These two connections alone were enough to make Zhou Qing, a small hospital dean, feel overwhelmed.

Thus, Zhou Qing never regarded Su Nantian as a junior. He treated him as an equal—perhaps even placed himself beneath him.

The onlookers were stunned by Zhou Qing's reaction, unsure of the young man's background. Who was he to warrant such reverence from Dean Zhou?

After all, Zhou Qing had always been known for his rigid and harsh demeanor. It was the first time anyone saw him smile, albeit a rather unattractive one.

"Dean, it's this guy! I told you about the disturbance in the hospital. Look at how he's beaten up the nurses!"

Seeing Zhou Qing arrive and ignore him, instead speaking with that young man for a while, Lu Jiajun's face was filled with anger. He pulled Lu Xiaoxu over to show Zhou Qing, shouting loudly.

Upon hearing Lu Jiajun's words, Zhou Qing's smile vanished completely. His face darkened.

He certainly recognized Lu Jiajun and Lu Xiaoxu, even to the point of familiarity. After all, they were his old friend's grandson entrusted to him.

Over these years, Zhou Qing had a clear understanding of Lu Jiajun's behavior in the hospital. He knew that this so-called conflict was between Su Nantian and Lu Jiajun.

The reason Zhou Qing had greeted Su Nantian so warmly upon entering the room was also to send a message to Lu Jiajun.

This man is formidable; even I can't afford to provoke him. You should back off immediately!

Most people would have hesitated after seeing Zhou Qing's reaction, but Lu Jiajun was clearly an exception.

Hearing Lu Jiajun's words, Zhou Qing's expression grew even more severe. Over the years, Lu Jiajun had caused him no small amount of trouble. Often, it was Zhou Qing who had to clean up his messes.

Now, he had finally encountered someone even Zhou Qing couldn't handle. Having taken in his old friend's grandson for these years, he had done his part and felt no guilt.

"Mr. Su, what do you think about this matter?"

After thinking it through, Zhou Qing had no hesitation and directly asked Su Nantian.

Su Nantian shook his head and countered, "This is your hospital. The one who caused the problem was your staff. It's strange that you're asking me?"

"Still, I'm curious—what kind of person is it who could become a doctor with such behavior?"

Hearing Su Nantian's words, Zhou Qing turned around and immediately gave an order: "Notify the personnel department. Doctor Lu Jiajun is officially fired. Let him collect three months' salary from the finance department and leave."

Chapter 253: Dragon Group

No one could believe that Zhou Qing had made such a decision so easily, all because of a single sentence from this calm young man.

Lu Jiajun was completely defeated. He didn't know how things had escalated to this point, and it hadn't gone according to his plan at all. It was completely off-script.

"Wait... Dean, it's him..."

"Lu Jiajun, you've been fired. Please don't stay here any longer and hinder other doctors from diagnosing patients."

Hearing Zhou Qing's cold words, Lu Jiajun was stunned. But this was reality—there was no denying it!

With a dazed expression, Lu Jiajun and Lu Xiaoxu left the hospital. At that moment, the sun above seemed unbearably bright.

Lu Xiaoxu kept her head down, staring at her feet as she asked Lu Jiajun ahead: "Brother, don't you think I'm beautiful? Why won't that Su Nantian go out with me?"

"Beautiful! My sister, Lu Jiajun, is the most beautiful. That dog Su Nantian's loss of you can only prove he has no taste!"

When mentioning Su Nantian, Lu Jiajun suddenly realized.

"Su Nantian! Everything is because of you, you trash! Wait until I find someone to deal with you!"

Saying this, Lu Jiajun pulled out his phone and dialed a number without any name record.

"Hello, what's up?"

"I need you to teach someone a lesson!"

"Who? How do you want to teach him?"

"Su Nantian! Hmm, break his legs."

After hanging up the phone, Lu Jiajun seemed in a better mood. His mouth curled upward and he hummed a tune, albeit one that was extremely unpleasant.

"Who is it? Any mission?"

"No, just an old friend. He asked me to help him with a small trouble."

In Fengcheng, in a villa with no identifying marks.

A burly man on the sofa asked the lean man who had just finished his call, "What's going on? A small trouble? Do you think we're street punks?"

Compared to the burly man's dissatisfaction, the lean man smiled and explained: "Li Zhan, do you remember the Lu family?"

Hearing this name, Li Zhan was slightly stunned.

"The Lu family? Which one? The Fengcheng Lu family?"

"Of course! In the old days, our elders had a good relationship with the Lu family. We owed them a favor and promised to do three things for them. Considering this one, it's exactly the third!"

Hearing the lean man's words, Li Zhan was truly confused. Why would the Lu family be so foolish as to use such precious requests, even allowing them to regain their former glory?

But now they had used it so casually. It was truly incomprehensible.

However, instead of wondering why it was so hasty, the lean man felt quite relieved. After completing this task today, his promise would be fulfilled.

The two men arrived at Fengcheng Brain Hospital. As they got out of the car, they saw Su Nantian coming out with a woman.

They exchanged glances. The lean man got out of the car and approached Su Nantian, with Li Zhan following closely.

"What's up?"

Seeing the lean man approaching him, Su Nantian asked cautiously.

Because he suddenly realized that this man's aura was impenetrable!

It was incredible.

After all, in recent times although he hadn't practiced much, his cultivation had rapidly increased due to Su Yu Jian's presence. His speed of progress was astonishing.

Yet even so, he couldn't discern this man's true nature. It was truly terrifying.

There were only two possibilities: either this man had a high cultivation level, far surpassing Su Nantian's.

Or he had mastered some secret method to conceal his aura.

Either way, it was definitely worth Su Nantian's caution.

"Hello, is this Su Nantian?"

"No, sorry, sir. I think you've made a mistake!"

The lean man hadn't finished speaking when Su Nantian interrupted him, directly denying it.

"Haha! Don't play around!"

Hearing Su Nantian's words, Li Zhan behind him laughed out loud.

"When have we ever mistaken someone? What are you talking about?"

"Sir, don't listen to my colleague's nonsense. We're from the National Security Bureau's Internal Office. There are some matters we'd like to ask you to investigate."

While saying this, the lean man took out an ID card from his pocket and placed it in front of Su Nantian.

Although Su Nantian couldn't understand what the ID card was, it definitely had a high level of prestige.

Nodding, he instructed Wang Feixue to leave. Su Nantian directly followed the lean man and Li Zhan into their car.

It was indeed bold to be so confident. Although he couldn't yet discern the lean man, he had some confidence in the burly man behind him.

From afar, one could feel a wave of blood qi coming towards them. Combined with his physique, Su Nantian was over 90% sure that this burly man was a cultivator, and more specifically, a rare body cultivator.

The term "rare" here didn't just refer to Earth. Even on Earth, body cultivators were extremely rare.

Body cultivators were uncommon even in the cultivation world. Su Nantian knew this well.

Back when he was on the cultivation continent, body cultivators had once been popular. Many people had chosen this path that didn't require refining weapons and seemed to demand fewer resources.

However, in reality, body cultivators needed various medicinal herbs to strengthen their bodies. The resources they required were no less than other cultivation paths.

This didn't necessarily mean body cultivators would be eliminated. The real reason for their decline was when a body cultivator had accidentally provoked a wandering immortal swordsman.

The result was that the entire sect was slaughtered by one swordsman.

This incident shocked the cultivation world. Although the swordsman eventually met his end, it was a farce that made the entire cultivation world realize the limitations of body cultivators.

Against other cultivators, it was manageable. But against swordsman, they were completely at a disadvantage!

Their attack speed wasn't fast enough, their range was too short. Their movement speed was also slower. Most importantly, one sword could cut through everything. You couldn't withstand it or dodge it!

After that, the body cultivator lineage fell into decline and almost disappeared.

Unexpectedly, Su Nantian had encountered one here. He couldn't help but glance at him twice. After all, he was also a swordsman himself. He wanted to see how this man would withstand flying swords with his head.

Sitting in the car of the lean man and Li Zhan, Su Nantian looked at this black vehicle as it drove out of the city.

Chapter 254: Preparation

Su Nantian was puzzled and asked, "Gentlemen, now that we've arrived here, can you tell me who is it that has sent two cultivators to deal with me?"

Hearing Su Nantian's words, the lean man showed no surprise.

He slowly parked the car in a desolate area and turned to Su Nantian with a smile, "You really aren't an ordinary person. It seems today has indeed brought some unexpected gains!"

As he said this, he got out of the car and casually opened Su Nantian's door.

"Western suburbs of Fengcheng, I suppose you're not unfamiliar with it?"

The previous battles at the Gao family in Hezhou and the several fights in Fengcheng's western suburbs had already drawn the attention of the National Security Bureau, which was why the lean man and Li Zhan had this mission.

As for Lu Jiajun's call, it was just a coincidence. Unexpectedly, it had also brought an unexpected gain to complete the previous promise.

"I don't really know this place. It's just a run-down building, what's there to be familiar with?"

Su Nantian got out of the car and surveyed this desolate area. He realized he had a connection with this land, as countless battles had taken place here.

"Is that so? Then Mr. Su isn't planning to tell the truth, is he? If that's the case, I might really have to take you back to the National Security Bureau."

"Oh? Then try it!"

Su Nantian wasn't afraid and smiled in response. Although their tone was polite, with smiles on both faces, the content of their conversation felt tense.

The atmosphere grew heavy. Li Zhan, who had been silent, couldn't help but adopt an offensive stance.

"Aha ha ha! Since Mr. Su doesn't want to go, let's just leave it for now. I'll visit you again later!"

One minute passed after another, the air seemed to solidify. When this tension reached its peak and was about to explode, the lean man smiled and spoke.

As he said this, he signaled Li Zhan to get into the car. The two of them drove off directly.

Seeing this strange move, Su Nantian was truly stunned. What the hell? You took me from the hospital here and then just left me?

Do you know this is the western suburbs? It's really hard to catch a taxi here!

In the car, Li Zhan was also confused. The lean man had been acting strangely and kept giving him questioning glances.

"Alright, it's annoying. If you have questions, just ask directly!"

"What? We're leaving like this? That Su Nantian apparently knew about us being cultivators. There's clearly something wrong with him!"

Hearing Li Zhan's words, the lean man was stunned.

"Right! There's clearly something wrong with him. Let's go back and catch him, then we can deal with the little issues he has! I'm not afraid he'll deny it!"

Seeing the lean man about to turn back, Li Zhan suddenly panicked.

"Don't! Don't mess around! The superiors said that Su Nantian might have the long-lost flying sword inheritance, known as one sword to break all laws. We two might not be able to withstand it!

Even if we could withstand it, the parts we lose would be too costly!

Moreover, this guy apparently had a mysterious substitute. They had both appeared before! One was on a TV show, the other rushed to Hezhou and destroyed the Gao family!

Even the Qingyang Sword Sect didn't say a word, letting him roam freely until now. His methods were truly mysterious.

Don't provoke him lightly!"

Li Zhan said all this, but found the lean man was looking at him with a strange gaze as if he didn't recognize him.

"What... what's wrong?"

"Ah, I never thought that Li Zhan, who looks so reckless, could think this much. Then why did you ask me earlier why I just let him go?"

"I... it was just a slip of the tongue!"

The lean man glanced at him and said nothing more. He stepped on the accelerator, and the car sped away from there.

Only Su Nantian was left alone walking home from here. This remote area was a hotbed for criminal cases, with no cars around at all.

Even if there were cars, few people would stop here. There had been many cases of taxi drivers being killed while stopping here. The losses and gains were completely disproportionate.

Many people would risk their lives for just a few hundred yuan.

The conversation between the lean man and Li Zhan in the car was unknown to Su Nantian. Otherwise, he would have been truly shocked. He never imagined the state's control was so strong, knowing everything he did and when.

Anyway, there wasn't much to do. Su Nantian didn't rush and walked back to Lin's villa.

Tomorrow was the third day of his agreement with Long Hu Yan. They had a match on the rooftop, and Su Nantian planned to prepare.

Although he hadn't practiced much these days, even Su Yu Jian had gradually become quiet and no longer appeared in the media.

Compared to true divine faith, the faith power brought by fans had a major drawback—it wasn't stable. It was hard to have the steadfastness of a fanatic, most were just superficial.

So when Su Yu Jian became quiet, the faith power obtained was even less. However, both his body and divine spirit had subconsciously reached the peak of the Qi Cultivation level 8.

To deal with a small Long Hu Yan, what preparation was needed?

Moreover, Su Nantian had an ultimate weapon that he hadn't used yet. He was sure that once it was taken out, it would definitely surprise everyone!

Since the last time he had obtained 500 tons of steel to refine xuan iron and create a flying sword called "Fuyun," this Fuyun flying sword had never been activated or seen blood.

It was simply because there were no opponents worth using it against. Originally, he thought the Hezhou Gao family might have some ability, but they turned out to be just a showy fake. A single innate sword had already subdued them, and they hadn't even seen the flying sword's shadow.

Su Nantian's preparation was naturally not for Long Hu Yan, but for the two black-cloaked men who had suddenly appeared—those from the National Security Bureau's Internal Office.

Although these two hadn't fought with him today, their hostility was impossible to hide.

Su Nantian had confidence that one day he would meet those people again, and maybe they would fight to the death.

The big man was a rare body cultivator. Su Nantian didn't take it seriously, but the lean man was somewhat opaque to him.

It was for precaution!

From his ring, Su Nantian took out the xuan iron throne built from the Gao family's gate and carefully thought about how to refine it.

Chapter 255: Coward

First of all, the essential step was to refine xuan iron essence and strengthen his Fuyun flying sword. This was the foundation of everything.

Previously, it had only been 500 tons of ordinary steel refined. The xuan iron obtained was just a small amount. Although Fuyun flying sword had eventually been refined, its quality wasn't very high.

That is to say, in a place like Earth with backward resources. If it were on the cultivation continent, such a flying sword would be laughed at by others—it was too simple.

The Gao family's gate was entirely made of xuan iron. Now it had all fallen into Su Nantian's hands, totaling over a thousand catties!

Refining the flying sword didn't require that much. So Su Nantian chose xuan iron essence extravagantly.

Xuan iron is the essence of iron, its color dark black, and its texture heavy.

Xuan iron essence is the quintessence of xuan iron! Ten parts can get one.

To refine a new version of the Fuyun sword, Su Nantian consumed most of his xuan iron. It was truly a huge expense.

But the new version of Fuyun sword was much stronger than before. Not only did it add more sharpness, concealment, and feather arrays, but Su Nantian also added the illusion and will arrays to the new Fuyun sword.

Only then could the Fuyun sword be considered a true flying sword!

The first three arrays are the basic requirements for any flying sword. A powerful attack, fast flight, and concealed aura. These three complemented each other to form a flying sword.

However, such a flying sword could only be considered the minimum configuration. It was like a computer with just a mainframe and no monitor.

Now, Su Nantian's added illusion and will arrays were equivalent to completing the infrastructure.

The illusion array could split the sword light, allowing countless flying swords to move back and forth with just one strike. The will array was the basis for controlling the flying sword's size.

Although these functions seemed simple, they were indispensable. It could become a massive sword to cut through the sky and earth or be refined into thin threads to hide in the shadows.

The remaining xuan iron Su Nantian didn't use excessively. He still refined it into a massive iron throne.

Of course, compared to the previous rough style, this iron throne was undoubtedly more refined.

Black as ink, with a dragon coiled around it. Sitting on it was a skeleton crawling on the ground, with ghostly fire flickering!

It could be said that this iron throne looked like it was made by no good person. It would be perfect for playing a major villain in various films without needing any makeup!

However, Su Nantian's resources were indeed limited. There was no good material. This iron throne had only a surface appearance, looking imposing but completely useless.

The only array carved was a floating array. Unfortunately, it could only hover half a meter off the ground because of the throne's weight.

When Su Nantian came out of the secret room, it was already five in the morning. Originally, he had planned to spend the night with a few girls, but now he could only shake his head and laugh.

Cultivation was like this—time for them passed too quickly.

In the cultivation world, a single retreat could last centuries or even millennia. The loneliness of being alone was something outsiders couldn't understand!

So Su Nantian cherished these current lives. He didn't want to wait until one day he opened his eyes from the secret room and found all his beauties had turned into red-painted skeletons.

Today was the third day of his agreement with Long Hu Yan. They had a match on the platform, so Su Nantian didn't waste much time and directly went to school.

Long Hu Yan, the leader of the Taekwondo club, was a figure in his own right. Over these two days, news of this match had spread throughout the entire school.

So when Su Nantian arrived at the Taekwondo club at noon, he found it surrounded by layers of students.

Everyone had come to watch Su Nantian's match against Long Hu Yan. It was the typical "watching trouble without getting involved" mentality.

Long Hu Yan, the leader of the Taekwondo club, was a star in the entire campus. He was handsome and had achieved many honors for the school. In the campus, he had countless fans.

Su Nantian was a rising star in a short time. In recent days, the entire school had been talking about his news. Although he was just a freshman, with his handsome face alone, he had already gained the favor of many senior girls.

Now that these two stars met, this match had drawn the entire school's attention.

"Long Hu Yan is a black belt! Su Nantian looks like a pretty boy. Are you really brave enough to fight him?"

"You don't know, right? Don't look at this Su Nantian's weak appearance. It's said he also comes from a martial arts family!

His skills are no less, and his physical condition is excellent. These two fighting each other might not be clear who would win!"

"Is it true? Brother, do you have this insider information? Who did you vote for in the online poll about the winner?"

"Hey, I definitely voted for Long Hu Yan!"

"You said Su Nantian..."

"I'm not stupid!"

...

The entire campus was filled with such conversations, and the discussions were endless. Su Nantian became a focus of attention without realizing it. Yet everyone said he was handsome, but no one could recognize him on campus, which made him quite speechless.

"Hey, let me in!"

Patting the student in front of him, Su Nantian said to him.

"Go to the back and queue. I came here after my second class in the morning. It took me a while to get this spot, and I won't let you!"

"Um... Hey, I'm Su Nantian. If you don't let me in, what are you watching?"

"Stop joking! From morning until now, four Su Nantians have already entered. None of them are as handsome as you!

You're not even worthy to imitate Su Nantian. You don't even look as good as me!"

"..."

Su Nantian was truly speechless. He didn't know where this guy's self-esteem came from.

Come on, when you say that, can't you take off those thick-bottomed glasses and squeeze your pimples?

Your pimpled face really gives you confidence, doesn't it?

Anyway, he wasn't in a hurry. Su Nantian sat on the nearby bench and quietly took out his phone to take a photo of this crowd, then posted it on WeChat Moments.

He wasn't in a hurry, but someone was. At this moment, the Taekwondo club members had already set up the stage in the crowd.

Long Hu Yan stood in a corner with his arms crossed, face expressionless and serious.

He didn't take this unknown Su Nantian seriously at all. His current appearance was just for show.

Next to him stood a tall, well-proportioned girl wearing a white Taekwondo uniform. She was looking at him with stars in her eyes.

Chapter 256: Playing Tricks

That look of admiration was completely uncontrollable.

This girl, Zhang Xiaoya, was a freshman this year and had just joined the Taekwondo club.

Since Zhang Xiaoya entered the Taekwondo club, she had instantly captivated Long Hu Yan.

He hadn't dated anyone before and had many girls who liked him. But this time, Zhang Xiaoya made him feel what it meant to be heartbroken.

If it were other girls, Long Hu Yan wouldn't have been so worried. His strong confidence had always been his trademark.

But facing Zhang Xiaoya, he couldn't help but be careful and nervous. He felt like the time when he secretly held hands with his first love.

Today, he had planned to have a few people behind the stage prepare roses for him. He intended to propose to Zhang Xiaoya after defeating this unknown Su Nantian.

Hearing the rumors around the school, Long Hu Yan nodded slightly. He was quite satisfied.

If the opponent were too weak, how could he highlight his strength?

He also wanted to use this match's victory as a prelude to his proposal. As for Su Nantian, he could only be a background.

As for the incident between him and Xu Wenhao, Long Hu Yan didn't care. After all, they were just chickens fighting each other.

But since it had offended the Taekwondo club, he naturally had to step up. Otherwise, people would think the Taekwondo club was easy to bully. Then he wouldn't be able to continue.

"What's going on? Why hasn't South Tian come yet?"

Lin Suyun sat in the front row of the audience, with Yao Lina and Gao Jingjing by her side. The three friends were extremely tense. It had already been over ten minutes since the agreed time, but Su Nantian hadn't appeared yet!

"Maybe Su Nantian knew he couldn't beat Long Hu Yan and was too scared to come out?"

"He must have hidden. From now on, he won't be able to walk with his head up in school..."

"Quickly call him out. Let him surrender early and kneel to apologize, I'll forgive him!"

The scene was extremely chaotic with various voices shouting.

Lin Suyun took out her phone and called Su Nantian. As soon as the call was answered, she asked anxiously: "South Tian, where are you? Did you forget that it's your match against the Taekwondo club leader today?

The match has already started. Why haven't you appeared yet?"

Su Nantian answered the call and heard this little girl's questions. His mouth couldn't help but smile.

"Don't worry, I've already arrived. It's just that there are too many people outside, and I can't get in. Tell the Taekwondo club to send someone to pick me up?"

After much trouble, Su Nantian finally stood on the platform. Long Hu Yan stood opposite him and observed this rising star in the school.

He felt a little annoyed. This guy looked like such a pretty boy, with no martial arts spirit at all. It made Long Hu Yan look down on him.

He had originally thought this guy might have some skills. Now, it was truly better to meet than to hear about him. He felt a little regretful but since he had already stepped onto the platform, he wanted to end the fight quickly.

After all, there was something more important to do later. Thinking about this, Long Hu Yan turned and looked at his beloved girl. He found that Zhang Xiaoya was staring directly at the stage, her mouth slightly open and a dazed expression on her face.

"(⊙o⊙) Wow! So handsome!"

Although Long Hu Yan didn't know how to read lips, he could roughly understand her meaning.

From his perspective, he could clearly see that Zhang Xiaoya was staring at someone other than himself. It was the pretty boy on the opposite side!

In an instant, his eyes turned red! He truly felt a sense of heartbreak for Zhang Xiaoya. So he looked at Su Nantian with even more annoyance.

Standing there loosely, without any martial arts posture. He looked like a complete waste!

Although he was angry, Long Hu Yan still bowed and performed the standard Taekwondo etiquette.

Su Nantian didn't quite understand it but imitated it. This made the other person frown.

As the leader of the Taekwondo club, Long Hu Yan had always strictly required etiquette. Seeing someone behave so carelessly on the platform was even more infuriating!

This wasn't just about whether he found him annoying. It was completely insulting to himself!

With the referee's command, the match officially began. If before today, Long Hu Yan had thought of punishing him a little to not disgrace the Taekwondo club's name, then after truly seeing Su Nantian himself, he really wanted to beat him down.

He didn't hold back at all. His two arms were raised in a defensive posture, and with one step forward, he was already at Su Nantian's side.

A whip kick carried a sharp wind and aimed directly for his neck! This attack, besides not using cultivation techniques, was also a full effort.

However, this sharp attack seemed like child's play to Su Nantian. He didn't take it seriously at all and slightly shifted his body to dodge the whip kick.

Long Hu Yan indeed had some skills. This high-positioned, large-opening whip kick was also quickly changed. As his right foot landed, he immediately jumped up and in the air, a leg like an axe came down!

"Good!"

This attack made Su Nantian nod in approval. Although it was still full of flaws and the power wasn't great, at least it showed Long Hu Yan's strength.

Especially that quick recovery and jump was something ordinary people couldn't do. It required absolute control over every detail of one's body and a strong physical condition.

Unfortunately, this attack method was so fierce-looking but had too many flaws.

As Long Hu Yan's leg came down, a hand suddenly appeared on his attack path.

A white and slender hand with smooth skin. It was completely impossible to imagine that this was a martial arts person's hand.

In fact, anyone who saw this hand would first think it was weak and powerless.

Yet now, this weak and powerless hand appeared there and effortlessly grabbed Long Hu Yan from mid-air. He was thrown back to the other side of the platform!

Chapter 257: Variegated Tiger

Although it took a while to describe, the exchange of blows was fast. Others saw Long Hu Yan charge forward with his fierce and powerful moves, kick twice, and then be thrown back.

No one could believe it. They hadn't even realized what had happened yet.

Although he was somewhat embarrassed, Long Hu Yan still landed on the ground steadily. However, his face was now serious and had no trace of anger.

Although he knew he hadn't used his full strength, even without it, those two moves weren't something ordinary people could easily withstand.

Those two attacks were clearly full of anger and no mercy. Yet Su Nantian had simply deflected them, which made Long Hu Yan unable to believe it.

"Show me your real skills. With these, you can't beat me!"

His face was serious and he hadn't yet continued the attack when he heard Su Nantian's lips move. A soft voice echoed in his ear, making him stunned.

"Immortal?"

He felt a similar aura on Su Nantian. Although it was slightly different from his own cultivation, it was definitely an immortal!

At this moment, he felt a little strange. On one hand, he was very angry at Su Nantian, but on the other hand, he wanted to communicate with him.

Long Hu Yan's cultivation path was taken by chance. He had reached this level through a broken technique, and it was almost at its limit.

Su Nantian was the only immortal he had met besides himself. He was eager to communicate with him.

But thinking about Zhang Xiaoya, Long Hu Yan felt even more annoyed. Why did this pretty boy come and make his girl so infatuated?

"Ha! Even if you are an immortal, what can you do? I Long Hu Yan don't consider myself inferior to anyone. If I hadn't met him, it would have been okay. Today I want to test my own strength and see how far I've come!"

Deciding on this, Long Hu Yan no longer maintained the Taekwondo posture. Instead, he revealed a martial art.

Crouching with his legs spread wide and hands in claws, one front and one back, pointing at Su Nantian!

This stance had a slight resemblance to the ancient Chinese martial art of Tiger Fist.
