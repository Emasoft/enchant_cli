“Drip-drip—”

Returning to the Nan Gong estate, Su Nantian had just begun reporting his day's activities to Nan Gong Ping when his phone suddenly vibrated, signaling an incoming message.

“Someone’s looking for you?”
Nan Gong Ping lifted his head at the sound, curiosity in his gaze.

“Oh, it’s just junk mail.”
Upon hearing this, Su Nantian immediately showed Nan Gong Ping his phone screen. Nan Gong Ping glanced at it and, finding it was indeed junk mail, returned his attention to the conversation without further ado.

Yet Nan Gong Ping failed to notice that among these messages were several unique emoticons—Su Nantian’s self-created code. When combined, they conveyed that the task had been completed: the item he’d placed at the port had been successfully retrieved by his men. This method allowed them to communicate discreetly, ensuring no information was leaked even if the messages were seen. It was a double-edged sword of convenience and secrecy.

A fleeting smile flickered in Su Nantian’s eyes before he swiftly masked it, returning to their discussion of pressing matters.

“All inventory has been accounted for, and no issues have arisen with the goods.”
Su Nantian relayed the progress of the port to Nan Gong Ping.

“You handle affairs well, I trust you.”
Nan Gong Ping’s mind was elsewhere, offering a brief commendation before adding, “The key issue now is the wetland bidding. I wonder what Wu Chuan is up to behind the scenes.”

They had met several times recently, engaging in two or three lengthy discussions. Yet Wu Chuan had offered no clarity—neither had he signed the cooperation agreement nor granted Su Nantian time to present it. It was as if Wu Chuan had preemptively shut the door before Su Nantian could even speak.

“There’s half a month until the first bid. This is quite the prize; I suspect every major player in the inland port is eyeing it greedily.”
Nan Gong Ping sighed, his expression complex.

This was but one problem; the more pressing issue was that this wetland bidding had been entrusted to him by Nan Gong Lin, who had made it clear: completing this task would secure his position as the next head of the Nan Gong clan.

Thinking of this, Nan Gong Ping grew even more troubled—partly because he had yet to complete the first step, and partly due to self-doubt. He questioned whether he truly possessed the talent required for such a role.

“Master Big, rest assured—your rapport with Mr. Wu Chuan is quite amicable. Cooperation seems inevitable. I’m certain Mr. Wu Chuan will soon reach an agreement with you.”
Su Nantian chose his words carefully to console Nan Gong Ping. Yet this was no idle reassurance; he knew Wu Chuan’s nature well. How could such a shrewd old fox delay for so long?

Su Nantian was older by a generation and held considerable influence in the inland port. The wetland bidding had become common knowledge, and Nan Gong Lin had already publicized their intention to collaborate. Thus, Wu Chuan was effectively cornered. He might stall a few more times with Nan Gong Ping, but in the end, both families would join forces to seize this lucrative prize.

As for how they would divide the spoils, that was a matter to be decided after securing it.

“You’re right,”
Nan Gong Ping, having witnessed Su Nantian’s capabilities and methods, regarded him almost as a mentor. Upon hearing the reassurance, he quickly calmed down.

“This is only the beginning. I am the legitimate heir of the Nan Gong clan; I cannot surrender so easily.”
Nan Gong Ping muttered to himself, his hands clenching on the table as his gaze hardened.

“Su Nantian, I have a task for you.”
After clarifying his thoughts, Nan Gong Ping gestured Su Nantian closer and whispered something in his ear before sending him away.

After leaving Nan Gong Ping’s presence, Su Nantian did not immediately depart. He paused, his gaze darkening as he stared intently at the carved wooden door behind him.

After a moment, Su Nantian shook his head slowly, murmuring in a voice only he could hear: “A pity.”

Indeed, it was a pity.
Nan Gong Ping had exceeded Su Nantian’s expectations slightly—yet it was understandable. After all, he was the legitimate heir of the Nan Gong clan, his experiences far surpassing those of ordinary men. Moreover, Nan Gong Lin had nurtured him since childhood, treating him as the future head of the clan. Over years of exposure, Nan Gong Ping had naturally absorbed much of his father’s methods.

With three layers of his father’s skills, Nan Gong Ping could certainly safeguard the clan’s legacy. Yet he was unfortunate—Nan Gong Lin’s health had deteriorated, and internal threats had emerged. For instance, Nan Gong Fei.

Externally, as Nan Gong Lin’s influence waned, and with Nan Gong Ping still lacking the ability to act independently, opportunists had begun moving aggressively.

Thus, the Nan Gong clan was like a sieve with countless holes—internal strife and external threats left no place for peace.

It was precisely these reasons that caused Su Nantian to shake his head and deem Nan Gong Ping a pity.
Otherwise, with his current level, securing the clan’s headship was not impossible.

Alas, fate had played its cruel trick.

Chapter 671: The Lazy One

“Su Nantian!”
As Su Nantian was lost in thought, a woman’s voice echoed behind him.

This voice was one he knew well—perhaps even bore some irritation toward.

“Master Big seems to have plenty of time these days.”
Su Nantian turned slowly, smiling as he spoke. Listening closely, one could detect a subtle edge to his words.

“Do you not wish to see me?”
Nan Gong Yu Yan knew well enough to recognize the sharpness in Su Nantian’s tone. She pouted slightly, casting him a reproachful glance.

“Of course not. I simply thought Master Big had more pressing matters to attend to at this critical time, rather than idling about the house.”
Su Nantian shook his head, adding with a smile.

Yet he omitted one thought: no matter how leisurely Nan Gong Yu Yan was, she could go anywhere she pleased—just not in his presence.
He still needed to focus on dealing with those centuries-old foxes, and he certainly did not want to waste energy fobbing off Nan Gong Yu Yan, a nine-tailed fox with an insatiable appetite.

“I came to find you specifically,”
Nan Gong Yu Yan adjusted her expression, instantly returning to seriousness. Her tone was resolute.

“Specifically to find me?”
Su Nantian raised an eyebrow, surprised by her answer.

He glanced at Nan Gong Yu Yan with the corner of his eye, but could not yet decipher her thoughts or understand why she had sought him out.

“Yes!”
Nan Gong Yu Yan nodded formally, then gestured for Su Nantian to follow her aside. “I heard you went to the port today. Tell me, did they approach you again?”

Su Nantian followed her to a pavilion. As soon as he stepped onto it, Nan Gong Yu Yan asked him.

“Yes.”
Nan Gong Yu Yan had clearly tracked his movements, so Su Nantian was not surprised.
He admitted it openly and answered her question directly: “I just reported the port’s progress to your brother. I was about to seek you out when you arrived.”

He paused, then added: “It’s better this way. We can discuss it here.”
Su Nantian then relayed everything Li Zhe had told him to Nan Gong Yu Yan.

“Tonight? At ten o’clock tomorrow?”
Nan Gong Yu Yan, upon hearing Su Nantian’s direct and open response, had a momentary hesitation. Yet she quickly composed herself, her expression betraying no sign of unease.

She then asked Su Nantian: “What are your plans?”

“What else can I do? Since our last meeting, I’ve been waiting for Wu Chuan’s next move.”
Su Nantian answered openly, revealing his thoughts to Nan Gong Yu Yan: “Now that they’ve taken the initiative, we must seize this opportunity to gauge Wu Chuan’s intentions.”

Know your enemy and know yourself, and you will never be defeated. This was an ancient maxim Su Nantian fully believed in.

“Are you planning to attend the meeting?”
Nan Gong Yu Yan’s expression shifted, as if deep in thought. Her gaze grew solemn, and the pavilion’s atmosphere seemed to darken slightly, creating a tense and anxious mood.

“Of course.”
Su Nantian nodded immediately. Such an opportunity was too rare to miss.

“You must be planning to use this as a way to get close to Wu Chuan and rescue Wu You’er, right?”
Nan Gong Yu Yan’s tone grew more intense. Her gaze sharpened, as if scanning Su Nantian with infrared and X-rays, ready to pierce through him.

“Master Big! I don’t care what your true intentions are! But I will not allow you to harm the Nan Gong clan’s interests! You also cannot use us as a stepping stone to get close to Wu Chuan!”
Nan Gong Yu Yan spoke before Su Nantian could respond, her voice sharp and resolute. She had witnessed the secret between Wu You’er and Su Nantian, which was why she had uncovered his true intentions toward the Nan Gong clan.

“Master Big, you’re mistaken.”
Su Nantian did not show the slightest panic or fear at Nan Gong Yu Yan’s direct accusation. Instead, he grew even more composed: “I have never intended to harm the Nan Gong clan’s interests. I also know I lack the ability to use it as a stepping stone.”

He continued explaining: “Moreover, I joined the Nan Gong clan because of my admiration for it. Starting as a mere bodyguard, I’ve fought to carve out my place here. I believe only this grand stage could showcase my talents!”

How could Su Nantian let Nan Gong Yu Yan easily see through him?
After hearing her blunt accusation, he immediately formulated a countermeasure in his mind. He also adopted an air of resentment and unfulfilled potential, as if he truly resented his mediocrity.

“Then why are you involved with Wu You’er?”
Nan Gong Yu Yan, moved by Su Nantian’s expression and explanation, softened her gaze. Her tone became more gentle, no longer so confrontational.

“Wu You’er’s situation was something I discovered accidentally after joining your family. It was Wu You’er who sought my help, and at the time, I acted on a whim.”
Su Nantian then flashed an apologetic expression, as if realizing he had overstepped his bounds.

“Did you two not know each other before? Was it all a coincidence?”
Nan Gong Yu Yan furrowed her brows, skeptical. Yet deep down, she was beginning to believe Su Nantian.

Su Nantian did not miss the subtle expressions on Nan Gong Yu Yan’s face. He nodded firmly: “Yes, if I had the ability or support, I would have already resolved it. Why would I let it linger until now?”

He added with a self-reproachful sigh: “It’s my own arrogance that led me to believe I could help her. I was deceived by the ‘hero saves the damsel’ trope.”

As he spoke, Su Nantian let out a self-conscious chuckle, as if he had truly erred and could not meet Nan Gong Yu Yan’s gaze.

Chapter 672: Disruption

“Hmph, who asked you to be so overconfident? You blew your own horn too high.”
After hearing Su Nantian’s sincere explanation, Nan Gong Yu Yan had already believed most of it. Her tone lightened.

She had assessed Su Nantian’s explanation and realized he was telling the truth—his rise from an unknown underling to his current position was genuine. He had been with the Nan Gong clan for over half a year now.
Moreover, she had noticed him several times and given him opportunities to rise—otherwise, he would still be an unremarkable guard.
If his entry had been deliberate, it was because he had planned it. But her favor and approval were entirely passive—Nan Gong Yu Yan did not believe Su Nantian could have predicted such a low-probability event.

Furthermore, she had already thoroughly investigated Su Nantian, even delving into his ancestors. There was nothing remarkable about him—his resume was simple.
Nan Gong Yu Yan believed Su Nantian lacked the ability to manipulate everything secretly. If he had, why not directly rescue Wu You’er from Wu’s clan? Why waste time with such a convoluted plan?

At this point, Nan Gong Yu Yan was certain of her thoughts. Her gaze toward Su Nantian returned to normal.

Yet despite trusting him, she still issued a warning with an undercurrent of threat: “You’d better ensure this is all true. Otherwise, I’ll chase you to the ends of the earth and make you pay!”

After warning Su Nantian, she added: “Remember! I won’t interfere in your hero-saving-the-damsel situation. But the condition is that you don’t drag the Nan Gong clan into it. Otherwise, I won’t let you off.”

“Understood,”
Su Nantian nodded immediately. “What ability do I have to oppose the Nan Gong clan?”

Though he appeared timid on the surface, his mind was already filled with countless thoughts.

“By the way! You can go meet Wu Chuan tomorrow, but when you return, you must recount every word of your conversation to me. Not a single detail can be omitted! You absolutely cannot hide anything from me!”
Seeing Su Nantian’s cooperation and obedience, Nan Gong Yu Yan showed a hint of satisfaction. She then instructed him again, demanding he obey without question.

“Yes, I will follow your instructions.”
Su Nantian nodded. After all, he would be going alone. Nan Gong Yu Yan couldn’t plant spies on him. Thus, the details of their conversation would be entirely at his discretion.

If Wu Chuan spoke about something harmless, he wouldn’t mind revealing a little to Nan Gong Yu Yan. But if it involved their secrets, Su Nantian would say not a single word.

Yet he still marveled at Nan Gong Yu Yan’s intelligence—she truly embodied the intellectual prowess of the younger generation in the Nan Gong clan. She was also praised by Nan Gong Lin as a remarkable daughter, inheriting his father’s strengths.

In contrast, Nan Gong Ping, who sought stability and was easily swayed, seemed quite ordinary under Nan Gong Yu Yan’s presence.

Thinking of this, Su Nantian sighed again at how foolish Nan Gong Lin was to insist on passing the headship to the mediocre Nan Gong Ping.
This decision was like placing Nan Gong Ping on a fire, hastening the clan’s downfall.
Once the succession was complete and Nan Gong Lin closed his eyes, it would be the clan’s end.

“What are you thinking about?”
Nan Gong Yu Yan furrowed her brows, her tone laced with suspicion.

“Nothing… I was just thinking: why did Father choose Master Big for the headship instead of you, who is so talented?”
Su Nantian said this deliberately, feigning carelessness. He added an unnecessary explanation: “I mean, Master Big is still the legitimate heir, and Father hasn’t made a final decision yet!”

The phrase “cleanly disengaging” meant first muddying the waters.
As long as Nan Gong Yu Yan’s focus was diverted, she wouldn’t constantly watch him.
Though she would never uncover anything, Su Nantian simply disliked being under constant surveillance—it was no fun.

Su Nantian had deliberately said this, feigning carelessness and adding an unnecessary explanation. This made Nan Gong Yu Yan believe him more.

“Enough, do you think I don’t know?”
Nan Gong Yu Yan interrupted Su Nantian’s clumsy explanation, suddenly laughing: “My father is like that. He may love me too, but he truly loves my brother the most.”

At this point, Nan Gong Yu Yan seemed to realize her tone had become bitter and hinted at resentment toward both Nan Gong Lin and Nan Gong Ping. She quickly composed herself, falling silent without continuing.

“I think you would be better suited for this position.”
Su Nantian seized the moment to speak, taking up Nan Gong Yu Yan’s words. Before she could respond, he continued: “I believe you are exceptionally strategic and intelligent. If you were the next head, you would be far better than Master Big.”

“What can I do if I’m better?”
Nan Gong Yu Yan replied listlessly. It was said that both hands are flesh and blood, but how could one balance them? Nan Gong Yu Yan had constantly told herself not to care. Yet she couldn’t help but feel it.
If Nan Gong Ping had been more capable, that would have been fine. But he was so mediocre and ordinary—several times nearly ruined the tasks Nan Gong Lin had assigned.
Though he eventually completed them, Nan Gong Yu Yan believed she could have done it a hundred times better. She would never let the clan be mocked by others.
Yet she could do nothing, as Nan Gong Lin had directly entrusted the critical wetland bidding to her brother. This already indicated his choice.

“No!”
Nan Gong Yu Yan suddenly stiffened, her eyes widening with surprise at her own thoughts.
How could she have such a thought?
She shouldn’t have.

Nan Gong Yu Yan realized this and quickly looked up, no longer caring about Su Nantian. She urgently needed to calm herself.

“Don’t forget my words!”
Nan Gong Yu Yan left a single sentence before fleeing without looking back.

Chapter 673: Encounter

“Hmph.”
After Nan Gong Yu Yan had left, Su Nantian let out a light laugh. He thought of her hasty departure—she looked like she had run away in panic.
It wasn’t his fault; after all, he was stating the truth: Nan Gong Lin had treated them siblings unfairly, giving him an opening.

“Go question yourself; don’t bother with my affairs.”
Su Nantian let out another light laugh, whispering.

He had already seen that despite Nan Gong Yu Yan’s attempts to hide and change the subject, she was clearly flustered. In other words, she had been influenced by his words.

Once the seed of doubt was sown, it would take root and grow in her heart. Now was a critical time for the succession of the headship, so even without his interference, disputes would arise.

These arguments and suspicions were the nutrients for the seed of jealousy and doubt to grow into a towering tree in Nan Gong Yu Yan’s heart.
When that time came, no one could stop it—so Su Nantian wouldn’t need to interfere further.

“Let your family perform this play yourselves!”
Su Nantian looked toward the direction Nan Gong Yu Yan had left, then收回 his gaze. He let out a light laugh. After all, by that time, he would have completed his task and left the Nan Gong clan.
Thus, this play had nothing to do with him.

After thinking about Nan Gong Yu Yan’s matters for a while, Su Nantian stopped and focused on another important task.
Thinking of this, he forgot the brief incident with Nan Gong Yu Yan and went to report to Nan Gong Lin as agreed.

Su Nantian sighed, then took his steps toward Nan Gong Lin.

“Any progress?”
Nan Gong Lin coughed a few times, then took several deep breaths to steady himself.
Yet his efforts were in vain; he was clearly at the end of his strength. Su Nantian could tell from just a glance that he was merely putting on a brave face, no matter how many tonics he took.

Su Nantian withdrew his subtle gaze and sighed inwardly, then composed himself to answer Nan Gong Lin.

Su Nantian first informed him of Wu Chuan’s meeting request, then relayed the recent movements of Nan Gong Ping and Nan Gong Yu Yan.
Of course, when he told Nan Gong Lin, he omitted the part about Nan Gong Yu Yan discovering his secret. Additionally, he offered another piece of information:

“Master, you should pay more attention to Nan Gong Fei. He has been quite ambitious recently. A few days ago, he found an excuse to follow Master Ping and Wu Chuan’s meeting. And in recent days, he has been quite active.”
Su Nantian slowed his speech and spoke carefully. Since he had already muddied the waters of the Nan Gong clan, it wasn’t a problem to give Nan Gong Lin something else to worry about.

After all, Nan Gong Fei’s ambitions were not fabricated by Su Nantian; he was merely accelerating the process of something that would take a long time to ferment.

Moreover, by openly exposing Nan Gong Fei’s intentions, Su Nantian gave Nan Gong Lin a warning. If he acted promptly, it might slightly ease the clan’s internal problems.
Of course, if he ignored it, that was Nan Gong Lin’s problem—Su Nantian would not care.

“Unexpectedly, A Fei has hidden malice.”
Nan Gong Lin clearly wasn’t unaware of Nan Gong Fei’s actions. When Su Nantian revealed the final layer, he didn’t show much surprise or shock.

Nan Gong Lin sighed deeply and spoke softly—this sentence was more of a reflection than an inquiry. Thus, Su Nantian wisely remained silent and didn’t say anything inappropriate.

“His ambitions are quite large. It’s a pity he has been feigning madness for so long!”
Nan Gong Lin seemed to recall something, and his expression darkened. His face was filled with anger, as if he were extremely angry at that moment.

Nan Gong Lin’s fists clenched tightly, his eyes shifting from initial fatigue to sharpness. “Enough! Since he doesn’t focus on the right path and only hides, then don’t blame me for being ruthless!”

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian’s brows slightly twitched. He understood Nan Gong Lin’s meaning—Nan Gong Lin intended to deal with Nan Gong Fei.

Hearing Nan Gong Lin’s decision, Su Nantian was not surprised. After all, one who could manage such a large Nan Gong clan and keep its name prestigious must not be a kind person.

It was just that he had grown older in recent years, his health deteriorated, and his energy could not match his former ambitions. Thus, his sharpness was subdued. Plus, with Nan Gong Lin’s intention to retire and rest, he had also withdrawn his claws, handing the stage over to his younger sons.

Yet now that he had reappeared, his remaining authority was still formidable, enough to deter some opportunistic underdogs.

“Since Wu Chuan has repeatedly invited you to meet, go tomorrow as scheduled.”
Nan Gong Lin had already decided on his next move. The anger he showed when thinking of Nan Gong Fei was now subdued, and his demeanor returned to normal.

He changed the subject, as he hadn’t wasted words on Nan Gong Fei’s matter. This meant it would be handled by others, and Su Nantian wouldn’t need to interfere.

Thus, Su Nantian was happy to stay silent and avoid this murky water. He could use the time more wisely to plan his true goals, complete the task quickly, and leave.

Thinking of this, Su Nantian was even more willing to stay silent and avoid speaking, simply listening to Nan Gong Lin’s instructions.

“Just remember: the details of your conversation with Wu Chuan tomorrow must be recounted to me word for word. You absolutely cannot have ulterior motives.”
Nan Gong Lin was indeed the father of Nan Gong Yu Yan. His instructions were identical, almost word for word.

“If not, you will become the enemy of the entire Nan Gong clan.”
After saying the first part, Nan Gong Lin paused slightly. A moment later, his gaze turned sharp and fierce, unmasking his threat toward Su Nantian.

Chapter 674: Reflection

“Master Lin is overthinking, but I am a Nan Gong clan member. How could I have ulterior motives?”
Su Nantian immediately denied it, then pledged: “I will certainly follow your instructions and inform you of Wu Chuan’s intentions tomorrow, allowing you to regain your prestige.”

This was his previous suggestion—having Nan Gong Lin return to power. This would not only declare he was still capable but also deter those who were stirring up trouble, preventing them from acting recklessly.

“Hmph.”
Nan Gong Lin was satisfied with Su Nantian’s understanding and nodded approvingly. His gaze toward Su Nantian also carried a touch of admiration.

“You can rest assured; your contributions to the Nan Gong clan will be remembered, and I’ve seen your sacrifices. Do well in your duties for the Nan Gong clan; I will never let you down.”
Nan Gong Lin, having held power for years, was well-versed in the methods of a leader to win over subordinates. For someone like Su Nantian, who was talented and capable, he couldn’t merely suppress him but had to offer incentives. He also promised a grand stage for Su Nantian to showcase his abilities in the future.

“Thank you, Master Lin!”
Su Nantian also responded with a grateful expression, as if he were willing to tear out his heart and show it to Nan Gong Lin to prove his loyalty.

“Leave.”
Nan Gong Lin was even more satisfied with Su Nantian’s understanding, his expression becoming amiable. He waved his hand to let Su Nantian leave and added a comforting remark: “If you need anything, just ask directly. Don’t neglect yourself.”

“Thank you, Master Lin!”
Su Nantian again expressed his gratitude before leaving as instructed by Nan Gong Lin.

Yet, upon turning around, the gratitude on Su Nantian’s face vanished instantly, as if it had never existed. Meanwhile, Nan Gong Lin also concealed his amiable expression and turned his gaze sharp as a blade.

“Master Lin, are you truly confident in Su Nantian? I believe this person is cunning and ever-changing. I don’t know what his true intentions are!”
After Su Nantian left, a person emerged from behind the screen. This individual was clearly the Nan Gong clan’s steward.

The steward glanced at Su Nantian’s retreating back, his expression filled with concern as he looked at Nan Gong Lin: “Master Lin, you should think carefully. It’s better to observe this talent closely.”

“Hmph, steward, you can rest assured. I may be somewhat lacking in strength now, but I’m not completely old yet. I’ve seen many such types in my youth.”
Nan Gong Lin waved his hand, signaling the steward to calm down. He then smiled and spoke, his words clearly expressing disdain for Su Nantian.

“What’s the worth of this type? Just half a bucket of water, constantly making noise.”
Nan Gong Lin let out another sneer and continued mocking Su Nantian: “He thinks he has everything under control, but he doesn’t realize that all of this is because I gave him the opportunity. Otherwise, he would have been completely crushed and never had a chance to rise.”

Nan Gong Lin had already gathered many pieces of information about Su Nantian. The feedback was consistent—Su Nantian came from a small place and had risen unexpectedly, often forgetting his roots.

Moreover, the saying “doubt people but use them” applied here. Since he had decided to let Su Nantian rise, Nan Gong Lin had also prepared corresponding countermeasures. This ensured that even if Su Nantian harbored ulterior motives, he wouldn’t be able to act for long.

“Master Lin, since you have everything under control, I won’t say more.”
Hearing Nan Gong Lin’s confident and resolute demeanor, the steward naturally wouldn’t dare to challenge him further. He stopped discussing this matter.

“Master Lin, Wu Chuan is a sly person and unpredictable. Are you sure it’s safe for Master Ping to deal with him?”
The steward brought up another matter. Though he didn’t dare to question Nan Gong Lin’s arrangement, he still felt some concern. After all, Nan Gong Ping’s performance was evident to everyone—his abilities were lacking and he was merely average.

It was no wonder the steward worried about Nan Gong Ping’s ability to handle Wu Chuan, a shrewd old fox.

“Hmph, there’s no need to worry about that. Wu Chuan is a sly old fox, but he values his reputation. Otherwise, why didn’t he simply kill off the Wu family’s bloodline and become their head? Instead, he went to the wilderness to find Wu You’er.”
It was said that those who know you best are often your enemies. This saying applied equally to Wu Chuan and Nan Gong Lin.

Wu Chuan had placed Wu You’er on the head of the Wu clan for one reason: to silence the public and maintain peace, preventing things from getting too out of hand.
Additionally, using a Wu You’er found in the wilderness as head had another benefit: it allowed him to control her without worrying about other forces behind her.
This way, the Wu clan’s power remained in Wu Chuan’s hands, and he could also preserve his reputation—truly a win-win situation.

Unfortunately, Wu Chuan’s decision was seen as short-sighted by the other clan leaders. Each of them had a clear understanding of Wu Chuan’s intentions and secretly mocked him countless times.

“Trust Master Ping. Though his abilities are not as outstanding as Yu Yan, he has a sincere heart. Facing old foxes with simple-mindedness—who wins and who loses is uncertain. Moreover, everyone’s eyes are on this matter. Even if Wu Chuan wanted to trouble Master Ping, he would have to consider others’ opinions.”
Nan Gong Lin quickly returned his thoughts and explained, then ended the topic to stop the steward from bringing it up again.

In fact, this arrangement had two reasons: one was to test whether Master Ping truly had the ability to become head of the clan, and another was to counterbalance Wu Chuan.
Nan Gong Yu Yan was indeed intelligent, but her methods were too naive for Wu Chuan. He already knew how to deal with them. However, if Master Ping went out instead, his thoughts were so intricate that Wu Chuan couldn’t decipher them.

Since he couldn’t guess, Wu Chuan couldn’t plan his next move or find a solution. Perhaps this could truly solve the problem of Wu Chuan, that old fox.

Master Ping, Master Ping—your father has placed the rest of his life’s reputation on you. I just hope you won’t disappoint me!
Nan Gong Lin thought this silently, his thoughts drifting further away.

Chapter 675: Encounter

Soon, the next day arrived.
Su Nantian had already informed the Nan Gong clan’s people beforehand, so he left early to meet Wu Chuan at Jin Xiao Nightclub.

Su Nantian chose to drive himself, which prevented the Nan Gong clan from secretly planting spies and also avoided Wu Chuan’s suspicion. It was a double benefit. After meeting Wu Chuan, he could also find an opportunity to handle his own matters.

Soon, Su Nantian arrived at Jin Xiao Nightclub. This was an entertainment venue that only opened in the evening, so it was empty at ten o’clock in the morning.
However, Wu Chuan had likely already informed the nightclub’s manager. As Su Nantian arrived, a person was waiting at the entrance to greet him.
One took his keys to park the car, while another guided him inside.
