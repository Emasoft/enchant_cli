Chapter 597: Private Meeting

Su Nantian could see a flicker of hesitation in Nan Gong Yuyan's eyes, and he felt a sigh of relief. He knew that Nan Gong Yuyan would likely agree to his request.

"Then I accept your conditions. After the banquet ends, you clearly explain what's going on."

After saying this, Nan Gong Yuyan turned to look at Wu You'er standing nearby and said, "You are from the Wu family and are currently its new patriarch. Naturally, I cannot interfere with you. However, I must tell you that if you plan to harm our Nan Gong family, I will not tolerate it. You and your entire Wu family will face the consequences."

Then Nan Gong Yuyan addressed Su Nantian again: "If you lie even slightly after the banquet, I will expose your secret immediately. Do not think that ending the banquet means everything is resolved. Both your family and the Wu family will be thoroughly investigated. Come with me."

After saying this, Nan Gong Yuyan turned around and signaled Su Nantian to follow her.

Su Nantian glanced at Wu You'er, nodded to indicate there was nothing to worry about, and the two followed Nan Gong Yuyan back toward the dining hall.

When they returned, Nan Gong Lin looked at them with some confusion and smiled at Nan Gong Yuyan: "Yuyan, what happened?"

Upon hearing Nan Gong Lin's question, Su Nantian felt a flicker of tension but maintained his composure. After all, Nan Gong Lin was no easy opponent; though he had aged, he was shrewd and experienced in the world of power. Their small tricks would be obvious to him.

Su Nantian was also afraid that Nan Gong Yuyan might reveal the truth to Nan Gong Lin, but she simply smiled and said with grace: "Nothing."

Hearing this, Nan Gong Lin felt at ease. After all, Yuyan was his daughter; she had no reason to lie about an outsider. Moreover, Nan Gong Lin viewed Yuyan as a sharp and intelligent person, so he immediately believed her.

The banquet continued with toasts and laughter. As night deepened, Wu Chuan finally could not bear the alcohol and said to Nan Gong Lin: "I can't take it anymore. I need to go back. Thank you for the hospitality of the Nan Gong family. I hope we have opportunities to cooperate in the future. Also, regarding the inland port matters, I will speak to those workers and stop them from causing trouble there."

After some more pleasantries, Wu Chuan left with Wu You'er. Before leaving, Su Nantian gave Wu You'er a slight nod to reassure her.

He could clearly see the worry in Wu You'er's eyes, as she was afraid Su Nantian might not handle the matters of the Nan Gong family.

After the banquet ended, Nan Gong Lin also prepared to retire, so Nan Gong Ping and Nan Gong Yuyan could return.

Su Nantian followed Nan Gong Ping and Nan Gong Yuyan toward the villa, but as Su Nantian was about to return to his own villa with Nan Gong Ping, Nan Gong Yuyan suddenly reached out and said: "By the way, Nantian, it's not too late yet. Come over here; there's something about the inland port I need to ask you."

Nan Gong Yuyan used the pretext of an inland port matter to call Su Nantian over. Su Nantian knew this was merely a surface-level excuse; what she truly wanted to ask him was about his conversation with Wu You'er.

But Su Nantian still gave a symbolic glance at Nan Gong Ping, as he was Nan Gong Ping's bodyguard. Even though he now worked at the inland port, he was still considered part of Nan Gong Ping's team.

Nan Gong Ping showed no suspicion and nodded to Su Nantian: "If there's something to discuss, go ahead. I'll return first; the two of you have a talk."

After saying this, Nan Gong Ping walked into the villa alone. Su Nantian followed Nan Gong Yuyan to her villa.

When Su Nantian entered her villa, Nan Gong Yuyan immediately led him into her study and ordered the other servants to leave without her permission.

After confirming no one was around, Nan Gong Yuyan sat down on a chair and coldly looked at Su Nantian: "Alright, I've sent everyone away. Now tell me what's going on today. I've already taken the trouble to keep this secret for you, so it's quite generous of me."

During this time, Su Nantian had already prepared a series of responses. He knew that what he said next must be half-truths; the parts about his conversation with Wu You'er had to be truthful, otherwise Nan Gong Yuyan's sharp mind would immediately detect the lies.

But for some other aspects, he had to lie and not reveal his true identity.

So Su Nantian nodded and said: "Alright, I'll tell you what's going on."

"Let me ask and you answer. Whatever I ask, you must answer truthfully," Nan Gong Yuyan interrupted as Su Nantian was about to speak.

Su Nantian hadn't expected Nan Gong Yuyan to be so adept at taking the initiative. If one was not resolute, they would lose their rhythm and the conversation might become riddled with flaws.

But Su Nantian was not such a person; he didn't care about these things, and this kind of disturbance would never disrupt his composure. His mental cultivation was very strong; he wouldn't be thrown off by such minor disturbances.

So Su Nantian nodded and looked at Nan Gong Yuyan sincerely: "You may ask anything, and I will answer truthfully. I won't lie; I'll tell you everything."

Chapter 598: Question and Answer

After hearing Su Nantian's words and seeing his sincere gaze, Nan Gong Yuyan felt a sudden softness in her heart. But she quickly regained her composure, knowing she couldn't be deceived by Su Nantian's appearance. What she needed to do was thoroughly investigate what he was doing in the Nan Gong family and what relationship he had with the new Wu patriarch.

So Nan Gong Yuyan cleared her throat and asked: "Who are you? What's your relationship with the new Wu patriarch?"

Nan Gong Yuyan started by asking these two fundamental questions: who Su Nantian was, where he came from, what identity he had, and why he knew the new Wu patriarch.

After hearing this, Su Nantian nodded. He had anticipated that Nan Gong Yuyan would ask these questions and was prepared to answer seamlessly.

"My name is Nantian, with no concealment. I am a friend of the new Wu patriarch; we knew each other before."

Su Nantian had to conceal his identity and could not reveal his true self to the Nan Gong family, as it would bring unnecessary trouble. Moreover, at that time, Su Nantian was in a disguised state; if he revealed his disguise, it would only make Nan Gong Yuyan distrust him more.

"Why did you meet the Wu patriarch? What kind of connection do you two have?" Nan Gong Yuyan continued, as she was curious about this and could infer from their conversation that Su Nantian seemed to be trying to rescue the Wu patriarch and his family.

"We are friends, and this new Wu patriarch was captured by Wu Chuan. They had already left the Wu family because they were tired of the backstabbing and scheming within the clan, choosing to live as ordinary people.

But Wu Chuan, in his bid for the patriarch position, had them brought back and kidnapped both of their parents. They are now held in an unknown location as leverage to force the new Wu patriarch to obey him."

Su Nantian had not lied; everything he said was true.

However, Nan Gong Yuyan had already heard of this before. They knew that Wu Chuan had brought back a child who had escaped the Wu family, and these matters could be verified. The major families maintained communication, so it was indeed true that the Wu patriarch's son had once escaped.

Moreover, during this family selection process, they were well aware of this girl—she was the one Wu Chuan used as a pawn. He wanted to control the clan by using the legitimate heir's position, and this person's lineage was the most useful.

So after hearing Su Nantian's words, Nan Gong Yuyan nodded and had no doubts about what he said.

"So why did you come to the Nan Gong family? If your goal was to rescue him, you could have directly infiltrated the Wu family. Why did you enter our Nan Gong family instead?"

This was Nan Gong Yuyan's most genuine concern. She cared about the interests of the Nan Gong family, and the chaos within the Wu family had no real threat to her.

"At that time, it was impossible to infiltrate the Wu family during their selection process. Also, what I said earlier is true—there was an old man who told me that I could enter the Nan Gong family through this selection.

I thought that since the Nan Gong family is large and powerful, I could go with them to the Wu family's selection site and possibly rescue Wu You'er. However, I hadn't anticipated that her parents were not with her. If it was just her, I believe my skills would have allowed me to rescue her. But with both parents involved, I had no choice but to temporarily delay my plan."

Su Nantian's words were half-truths. There was no old man who told him to enter the Nan Gong family; it was all Su Nantian's own plan.

At that time, the Wu family was difficult to infiltrate; even if he entered, he couldn't directly access core departments. So Su Nantian thought of another way: entering the Nan Gong family and using it to go to the Wu family's selection site to try to rescue Wu You'er and Wu Tao's couple. This was the same as what Su Nantian had said.

"Then, can you swear that you have never done anything to harm the Nan Gong family?" Nan Gong Yuyan asked skeptically, staring at Su Nantian. She simply couldn't believe it.

After all, Su Nantian's main goal was to rescue Wu You'er; she couldn't believe he was truly loyal to the Nan Gong family.

However, Su Nantian nodded and said: "Although my main purpose was to rescue Wu You'er, I have done everything with all my effort for the Nan Gong family since entering it. I've never acted in self-interest.

Of course, if you insist on calling it self-interest, I simply wanted to elevate my status within the Nan Gong family so that I could have a chance to directly contact the Wu family.

Other than that, I swear I've done nothing to harm the Nan Gong family. And for all this time, I have truly treated the tasks assigned by the Nan Gong family as important missions."

When Su Nantian said this, he spoke with conviction and stared directly into Nan Gong Yuyan's eyes. His gaze was unwavering, making Nan Gong Yuyan unable to help but be moved internally.

But Nan Gong Yuyan would not show this emotion outwardly; otherwise, she knew Su Nantian would take it as a weakness.

"How can I believe you? You have no ulterior motives toward the Nan Gong family, and your entire purpose was to help that girl from the Wu family. Do you really think I would believe this? Do you think saying this will make me believe?"

Nan Gong Yuyan asked again, showing her disbelief in the matter.

"I know this sounds low in credibility, but I ask you to think carefully: after entering the Nan Gong family, every action I took was done with all my effort. And there were many tasks unrelated to the Wu family that I completed diligently, never doing anything bad toward Nan Gong Ping."

After hearing Su Nantian's words, Nan Gong Yuyan slowly recalled all the things Su Nantian had done since entering the Nan Gong family.

Chapter 599: Exchange of Conditions

In truth, Nan Gong Yuyan remained skeptical about Su Nantian's words. Although she had thought it over and realized that Su Nantian had indeed achieved many feats for the Nan Gong family after entering it, she still felt uncomfortable whenever she thought about Su Nantian's purpose of helping that girl from the Wu family.

Even if Su Nantian had done many good things for the Nan Gong family, it made her feel he was doing these things with ulterior motives.

However, Su Nantian clearly understood what part Nan Gong Yuyan was struggling with. He also knew that although he appeared to be doing things for the Nan Gong family, if people discovered his true intention of rescuing the new Wu patriarch, they would feel as though they had swallowed a fly.

"Do you think this is still meaningful? All the things I've done are indeed good for the Nan Gong family, but your entire motivation wasn't to help that girl from the Wu family. You say you have no ill intentions toward the Nan Gong family, but in reality, your heart was never with them."

Su Nantian had not expected Nan Gong Yuyan's mind to be so sharp. No matter what he said, she remained steadfast in her thoughts.

Su Nantian knew continuing like this would be futile, so he decided to change his approach.

"Yes, I admit it. My entry into the Nan Gong family was entirely to use it. I wanted to utilize the Nan Gong family's status to gain access to the Wu family's banquet. And I have great confidence in my own skills, believing I could become an important person's bodyguard. This way, I could quickly enter the Wu family and rescue Wu You'er.

But I hadn't anticipated that Wu Chuan had separated Wu You'er and her parents into different locations. If I only rescued Wu You'er, her parents would definitely be in danger. So I abandoned the idea of rescuing that night and returned to the Nan Gong family, using this opportunity to help Wu Chuan with his matters to see if there would be another chance to contact the Wu family.

But I must say, I truly have no ill intentions toward the Nan Gong family. If you still can't understand this and won't let me stay in the Nan Gong family, then go ahead and expose this."

Su Nantian's last sentence sounded like giving up, but it was actually one of his strategies. He wanted to take a step back and see what Nan Gong Yuyan's thoughts were.

After saying this, Su Nantian stared at Nan Gong Yuyan, waiting for her reaction.

However, after hearing Su Nantian's words, Nan Gong Yuyan did not immediately speak. She seemed to be lost in thought, as this matter was indeed difficult for her to decide.

Nan Gong Yuyan actually thought Su Nantian was very promising, and he had handled matters efficiently. Recently, he had done several things that were quite impressive, bringing considerable benefits to the Nan Gong family.

Additionally, he had handled the inland port matters very well. If someone else took over this task temporarily, Nan Gong Yuyan doubted they could achieve the same level.

Moreover, she herself couldn't manage everything, and at this moment, it was Nan Gong Fei who was in charge. If someone else took over temporarily, that would be a big problem for Nan Gong Fei.

After thinking it through, Nan Gong Yuyan felt that replacing Su Nantian at this moment was not a wise decision.

Plus, Nan Gong Yuyan herself still had some feelings for Su Nantian, which was a very emotional and irrational part.

After a while, Nan Gong Yuyan finally lifted her head and sighed deeply.

Seeing this, Su Nantian knew he had passed this crisis; it seemed Nan Gong Yuyan would not expose the matter, but she would definitely set many restrictions and conditions in return.

However, Su Nantian did not show his current emotions but remained tense and stared at Nan Gong Yuyan with a timid expression.

Finally, Nan Gong Yuyan spoke to Su Nantian: "After thinking it over, your actions on the roadside were quite impressive. However, the turmoil at the inland port has not yet subsided. My husband wants to fully control the inland port and gain complete benefits within a year. The next steps still need to be carried out.

If we replace you now, others may not be able to take over your arrangements. So let's make a deal."

After saying this, Nan Gong Yuyan stared at Su Nantian, waiting for his response.

Su Nantian had anticipated that Nan Gong Yuyan would use this method to restrict him. And correspondingly, since it was a deal, he might receive some convenience for rescuing the Wu family.

So Su Nantian pretended to think for a moment and said: "Madam, please speak. What kind of deal?"

"Since you also said that your purpose in coming to the Nan Gong family was to rescue the Wu family, using the Nan Gong family as a platform, then as long as you don't do anything harmful to the Nan Gong family, I can allow you to continue doing this. But before you rescue them, you must help me settle all the turmoil and dangers at the inland port.

Of course, I will also provide you with some help. You know that the Nan Gong family and Wu family will inevitably have cooperation in the future, so our relationship with them is very close.

And we are directly negotiating with Wu Chuan; he took the person you wanted to rescue as the new patriarch, which was just a charade. But in the end, you will definitely have an opportunity to meet him.

So I will help you get that chance to contact the Wu family. But your rescue mission, we won't interfere with it. I will only provide you with the opportunity to contact the Wu family, and the rest is up to you. And absolutely, you must not involve the Nan Gong family. That's the deal. Do you agree? If you do, we'll proceed like this. But if you don't, I will immediately tell your father about your true identity."

After saying this, Nan Gong Yuyan coldly stared at Su Nantian and waited for his response.

Chapter 600: New Cooperation

In fact, the deal Nan Gong Yuyan proposed was exactly what Su Nantian wanted. At this moment, his goal was to continue staying in the Nan Gong family and use it to contact the Wu family so that he could have better support for his future rescue mission of Wu Tao's couple and Wu You'er.

At first, Su Nantian had thought that Nan Gong Yuyan would expose his true identity, but instead she proposed a deal. And this deal's content was completely acceptable to him.

If Nan Gong Yuyan had indeed gone to tell Nan Gong Lin about his true identity, then both Su Nantian himself and Wu You'er and Wu Tao's couple would face great danger.

But it seemed Nan Gong Yuyan did not do that and instead gave Su Nantian an opportunity.

However, Su Nantian definitely couldn't immediately show his acceptance of this deal; otherwise, it would make Nan Gong Yuyan suspect that the deal was wrong. So Su Nantian still frowned and appeared very troubled, not immediately agreeing to her.

Seeing that Su Nantian did not immediately agree, Nan Gong Yuyan stood up and said: "Since you don't want to agree, I'll go find your father now and tell him about your true identity."

Seeing Nan Gong Yuyan about to leave, Su Nantian immediately called out: "I didn't say I don't agree. I accept it. That's settled."

Su Nantian could not let Nan Gong Yuyan leave to tell Nan Gong Lin. He immediately approached and grabbed Nan Gong Yuyan, who was about to turn around.

But Su Nantian's grip was too strong; he accidentally pulled Nan Gong Yuyan into his arms.

At that moment, Yang Yu felt a bit awkward between them, and it was their first time being so close.

Su Nantian could even feel Nan Gong Yuyan's breath on his face, which made him a bit distracted.

But he quickly straightened Nan Gong Yuyan and carefully said: "Are you okay? I didn't expect to use so much strength in my haste."

After saying this, Su Nantian immediately took a step back to create a safe distance between himself and Nan Gong Yuyan, as a way to express his apology and show that he wasn't doing it on purpose.

At this moment, Nan Gong Yuyan's face was completely red, even her ears were red.

"I... I'm fine. If that's the case... you've already agreed to our deal, but I hope you'll do your best for the Nan Gong family in the future."

Nan Gong Yuyan felt her heart was unstable, and this was the first time in years that she had experienced such a situation. She wasn't unaware of what this feeling was, but she hadn't expected her feelings for Su Nantian to have reached such a depth.

Nan Gong Yuyan recalled when she had felt this fluttering in her heart before; it was probably several years ago.

After that, she had focused on competing for the position of Nan Gong family's heir, striving to improve herself and putting aside her romantic feelings. For several years, she hadn't found a boyfriend, so such emotions had rarely occurred in her heart. It could be said that she had become a loveless person for several years, with no sparks of romance with any man.

But she hadn't expected that just by touching Su Nantian slightly, she felt this way. This made Nan Gong Yuyan feel very embarrassed with herself; she hadn't expected her feelings for Su Nantian to have grown so deep in secret.

"Madam, rest assured; I've always been dedicated to the Nan Gong family. Although I have my own goals, after meeting both families, every action I've taken has been for the good of the Nan Gong family. Now that this matter is laid out before you and we've reached a deal, I will definitely follow the terms of our agreement. Moreover, I do indeed want to use the Nan Gong family's power to get closer to the Wu family. So rest assured, I will have no ulterior motives."

Su Nantian said this firmly and looked at Nan Gong Yuyan with sincerity.

But Nan Gong Yuyan kept avoiding Su Nantian's gaze, thinking that if she met his eyes, she would be exposed.

So Nan Gong Yuyan waved her hand and said to Su Nantian: "Alright, I understand. You go first. As for the next steps, I'll assign them to you later. For now, just do your job well for the Nan Gong family and don't have any other plans in secret. When the Nan Gong family and Wu family cooperate, I will definitely include you."

Nan Gong Yuyan was urging Su Nantian to leave, but Su Nantian still asked: "May I ask boldly, when will the Nan Gong family cooperate with the Wu family next?"

"I don't know the exact time, but it's coming soon. This time Wu Chuan brought the person you know to come over, which was actually for discussing cooperation. But when we arrived, they had already finished their talks. Also, at the time of supporting their heir's ascension, we had said that when the Nan Gong family needs to cooperate with other families, it would first consider the Wu family. My father will definitely give the Wu family some face."

Nan Gong Yuyan, who was currently in charge of the inland port matters, wasn't very clear about this deal. However, she could judge that since she was in charge of the inland port matters, Nan Gong Lin might have assigned Nan Gong Ping to handle these matters.

Su Nantian also nodded and said: "I understand. Then, Madam, I'll go back now."

After saying this, Su Nantian gave Nan Gong Yuyan a slight bow and left her villa.

Nan Gong Yuyan's villa was adjacent to Nan Gong Ping's, so after Su Nantian left her villa and walked a few steps, he had already arrived at the entrance of Nan Gong Ping's villa.

At this point, Su Nantian had learned that the Nan Gong family would continue to cooperate with the Wu family. However, Su Nantian realized that this cooperation might not involve Nan Gong Yuyan, so Nan Gong Lin would definitely assign Nan Gong Ping to handle these matters.

But now Su Nantian was assigned to the inland port, and it would be difficult for him to interfere with this matter.

Chapter 601: Midnight Talk

Su Nantian thought that if Nan Gong Ping took over this matter, he might directly go to Nan Gong Ping's side. But then again, if he wanted to break free from Nan Gong Yuyan's control, maybe she would go to the end of her rope and reveal his true identity to Nan Gong Lin.

So, in this case, Su Nantian was a bit hesitant and found himself in a dilemma. He could go to Nan Gong Ping's side, but due to the restrictions from Nan Gong Yuyan, he couldn't rashly do these things.

"Never mind, I'll just take it step by step. Since Nan Gong Yuyan hasn't planned to expose me, I should have no problem following her," Su Nantian thought internally and then walked into the villa.

But Su Nantian hadn't expected that when he entered, Nan Gong Ping was already sitting in the living room, as if waiting for him.

"Master, it's so late; why are you still here?" Su Nantian asked curiously. But he mostly understood that Nan Gong Ping's posture was specifically waiting for him to return.

This made Su Nantian inwardly groan; had Nan Gong Ping discovered his relationship with Wu You'er?

But Su Nantian still maintained a calm demeanor and looked at Nan Gong Ping, wanting to hear what he had to say.

Nan Gong Ping waved his hand at Su Nantian, indicating he sit beside him.

After sitting down, Su Nantian saw Nan Gong Ping frown and said seriously: "How long will it take for you to finish your tasks at the inland port?"

"I don't know. So far, we haven't completely taken control of the inland port. The local gangsters there still refuse to hand over all their power and are trying to do something behind the scenes to gain some benefits for themselves."

As Su Nantian said this, he realized that Nan Gong Ping had been waiting for him not because he knew his identity but about the upcoming cooperation with the Wu family. He had guessed correctly that Nan Gong Lin would have assigned Nan Gong Ping to handle this matter, otherwise he wouldn't be frowning and asking when Su Nantian would finish his tasks at the inland port.

After all, Su Nantian's recent performance was evident to everyone, especially Nan Gong Ping had noticed his exceptional abilities in this area.

They had originally thought Su Nantian was only capable of being a bodyguard, but they hadn't expected him to have such strong intelligence in this field.
