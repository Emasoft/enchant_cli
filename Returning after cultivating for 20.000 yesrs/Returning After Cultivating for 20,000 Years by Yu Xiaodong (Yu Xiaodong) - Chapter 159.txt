However, at this moment, Nan Gong Yu Yan noticed the exhaustion in Nan Gong Lin's demeanor and gently tugged on Nan Gong Ping's sleeve, interrupting his words.

Before Nan Gong Ping could speak again, Nan Gong Yu Yan said: "Father, we all know. We will be more cautious and pay attention to events nearby. Father, you have worked hard today; it's late, so please rest."

After speaking, Nan Gong Yu Yan gave Nan Gong Ping a meaningful glance.

Nan Gong Lin was no fool; upon receiving the other's gaze, he immediately regained his composure. It was only then that he noticed Nan Gong Lin's ashen complexion and the unmistakable signs of fatigue.

"Father, rest well."

He also knew that rushing was unwise. Considering his father's age and recent poor health, he certainly could not afford to overexert him.

Thus, he suppressed his doubts and concerns, allowing Nan Gong Lin to rest first.

"Ah, you may go."

Nan Gong Lin nodded and added: "You should also rest early; don't overexert yourselves."

He had once fallen ill from overwork in his youth, and the condition had persisted until it became a chronic ailment. He did not want his children to suffer the same fate.

Nan Gong Yu Yan and Nan Gong Ping obediently replied, then ceased disturbing Nan Gong Lin. The two of them left together.

As soon as they stepped out, Nan Gong Lin could no longer suppress his coughing fits; his back bent with each violent spasm.

He clutched his mouth, clearly in great discomfort.

"Master."

The old housekeeper waited until they left before entering hurriedly, his face etched with concern upon seeing Nan Gong Lin's agonized expression. "Master, please take your medicine."

The old housekeeper spoke and immediately handed Nan Gong Lin the prepared medicine.

After drinking it, Nan Gong Lin's complexion slightly eased, but his overall condition remained grim; his eyes were bloodshot and yellowed, lacking the previous vitality.

"Master, this isn't a solution. You should see a doctor."

The old housekeeper observed Nan Gong Lin's slight improvement and exhaled in relief, yet his worry remained.

He had served Nan Gong Lin for years, accompanying him since he became the family head. Their bond was unlike others'.

The old housekeeper was the only one in the Nan Gong family who knew of his illness.

"It's nothing serious."

Nan Gong Lin waved a hand dismissively, showing no intention of calling for a physician. "My condition stems from overwork; even a doctor would only tell me to rest."

Moreover, with so many eyes watching the Nan Gong family and recent disturbances, even if he wished to call for a doctor, he would have to weigh numerous factors.

One misstep could allow the news to spread, and those with ill intent might exploit it, leading to even more troubles.

Additionally, Nan Gong Lin did not wish his children to worry over him.

"But Master, this isn't a solution!"

The old housekeeper knew his suggestion would be rejected but still hoped to persuade him once more.

"Enough," Nan Gong Lin interrupted the old housekeeper, then shifted the topic to distract him.

"Recently there's been so much going on; I haven't asked about the family affairs yet. How are things? Are they active? What about Nan Gong Fei?"

The most active was his eldest son's son.

He was intelligent, though only with petty cleverness. He even tried to hide it before Nan Gong Lin's eyes, making him appear like a foolish clown—capable only of causing trouble in small places but unable to fit into grander stages.

Thinking of this, Nan Gong Lin's expression darkened further, hoping these people would not stir up more chaos.

Otherwise, with both internal and external troubles, he would truly be in a bind.

"Master need not worry; I've been carefully watching them. Recently, they've remained quiet and caused no trouble."

The old housekeeper reported immediately to ease Nan Gong Lin's mind, fearing his mood would be affected.

"Ah, that's good."

When Nan Gong Lin heard this, he finally relaxed slightly, his expression easing.

These people were wise enough to know when to stop; otherwise, Nan Gong Lin would not have tolerated them for long. He would have used a decisive approach to deal with them thoroughly.

"Master, please rest well; I will continue overseeing family matters. Any discoveries will be reported to you immediately."

The old housekeeper reaffirmed his loyalty and urged Nan Gong Lin to rest: "Master, you should also take more care of yourself; don't let the eldest son and daughter worry."

The old housekeeper had brought up Nan Gong Yu Yan and her brother specifically to encourage Nan Gong Lin to take care of his health.

"Ah, rest assured."

Nan Gong Lin understood the housekeeper's concern and nodded. After mentioning Nan Gong Yu Yan, his face once again showed signs of exhaustion; he sighed and gave the old housekeeper final instructions.

"From now on, Yu Yan and Ping'er must be under your care."

Chapter 795: New Developments

"I believe in your abilities."

Nan Gong Lin sighed again, speaking to the old housekeeper with an earnest gaze, leaving no room for jest.

His words and tone seemed more like a deathbed commission.

It was as if he truly knew his time was near, rushing to settle his affairs before it was too late.

"What are you talking about, Master?"

The old housekeeper was genuinely frightened, feeling the immense pressure. He did not wish to hear such words and quickly interrupted Nan Gong Lin: "The eldest son and daughter are under your care; how could I dare to overstep?"

Nan Gong Lin heard this and only smiled faintly, saying nothing more.

Nan Gong Lin knew his own body well.

Especially with the recent burdens, he had become like a spinning top, never stopping.

That was fine, but Nan Gong Lin had also noticed his increasing fatigue and frequent exhaustion, lacking the energy he once had.

Thus, he knew he could not last long; otherwise, he would not have spoken these heartfelt words to the old housekeeper.

"Master..."

The old housekeeper glanced at Nan Gong Lin's expression, wanting to speak.

At this moment, Nan Gong Lin raised his hand and interrupted him: "Enough; I know what to do. You need not persuade me further."

After speaking, Nan Gong Lin waved his hand: "You may also rest; you've worked hard today."

His implication was clear—he did not wish the old housekeeper to continue speaking.

The old housekeeper understood Nan Gong Lin's meaning and reluctantly left, his heart heavy with regret.

Though their master and servant shared deep affection, those watching from outside remained cold, showing no trace of emotion.

This person was Qi Yinzhen, who had been monitoring the Nan Gong family for some time.

The recent troubles within the Nan Gong family were all orchestrated by him.

This was a promise he had made before: as long as Su Nan Tian remained unlocated, the Nan Gong family would never know peace.

These small actions were merely a minor indulgence for Qi Yinzhen.

Qi Yinzhen now watched them constantly, ready to intercept any movement by the Nan Gong family, preventing their success at all costs.

"Hmph. Enjoy this suffering."

Qi Yinzhen let out another cold snort, whispering to himself. He turned back to gaze at Nan Gong Lin, staring deeply before turning and vanishing into the night.

He came without a trace and moved with utmost secrecy, leaving the Nan Gong family unaware of anyone's presence. They would never discover that the one causing them trouble was Qi Yinzhen.

Meanwhile, Hong Ye's subordinates began relaying their findings to him.

"Master Hong."

The subordinate rushed in, bowing respectfully as he addressed Hong Ye.

"Hmm."

Hong Ye nodded, continuing his task without lifting his head. He only partially listened to the subordinate's report.

"Speak."

Hong Ye gave the order, and the subordinate immediately obeyed.

"Yes, Master Hong! We have scouted along these rivers and found five that connect with Wu Family's territory, each leading in different directions."

The subordinate immediately reported without delay: "These are the best routes we've selected. Su Nan Tian may have hidden in a place related to these five rivers."

"Five?"

Hong Ye raised his head, surprised by the subordinate's report. He paused in his actions.

"Such a large number?"

Hong Ye furrowed his brows, expressing confusion and continuing to voice his questions.

The subordinate quickly explained: "Master Hong, these are the five rivers we've narrowed down after careful selection. They are all highly likely places where Su Nan Tian may be hiding; we cannot reduce them further."

The subordinate faithfully reported to Hong Ye, and his words were truthful—no exaggeration or concealment.

This was the result of days spent scouting nearby areas and compiling information from those who returned, finally narrowing it down to these five rivers.

If Hong Ye found this number too high, they would be at a loss.

But the subordinate merely thought it to himself, grumbling slightly; he would never dare express his true thoughts before Hong Ye.

After all, he did not wish to be dismissed so soon.

"This area is too vast; it will be difficult to search, and with so many places, when will we find him?"

Hong Ye mused for a moment before speaking with his subordinate.

With five rivers, it meant many nearby towns and villages.

Even if there was only one river, finding him would be a complicated task; with so many choices and directions, it was even more challenging.

Thinking of this, Hong Ye felt some dissatisfaction, believing the subordinate had failed to perform adequately. He voiced his demands and opinions.

The subordinate felt some resentment but dared not show it before Hong Ye, or he would no longer be able to stay.

He merely suppressed his resentment and continued reporting the news to Hong Ye.

"Master Hong, this cannot be further narrowed down; otherwise, we might miss Su Nan Tian's trail."

The subordinate continued explaining to Hong Ye, hoping to ease his concerns. Without waiting for Hong Ye's response, he added: "We can assign more people to scout each river. This way, we can save time. Moreover, most of these rivers flow through villages, which rarely have strangers. If we investigate further and screen them, it will reduce many targets."

"This would be twice as effective and the fastest method."

The subordinate continued reporting to Hong Ye, earnestly explaining that this was the best solution their team had found after great effort.

Hong Ye had only been confused and slightly dissatisfied at first.

But he also knew that speaking was easy, while action was complicated; thus, he did not overly criticize.

Upon confirming this direction, Hong Ye nodded in approval: "Ah, good. Then proceed as you have planned. I believe in your abilities."

Chapter 796: Instructions

"Just don't let me down."

These people were more professional; Hong Ye trusted they would find him more easily.

"Yes, Master Hong!"

Hong Ye's subordinate had initially expected Hong Ye to be angry and reprimand them harshly.

He was even prepared to endure Hong Ye's anger.

But he had not expected Hong Ye's attitude to change so quickly, and the latter even comforted them, urging them to continue searching.

Not being reprimanded was the best scenario.

No one would be foolish enough to seek trouble, so Hong Ye did not reprimand them. The subordinate simply ignored the suspicion.

The subordinate quickly bowed respectfully and agreed to Hong Ye's request.

Seeing that Hong Ye had no further instructions, he left.

"By the way, there's another matter."

As the subordinate prepared to leave and issue orders, Hong Ye suddenly called him back.

The subordinate immediately halted his steps, turning to face Hong Ye, awaiting his instructions.

"Master Hong, do you have more orders?"

The subordinate asked respectfully again, showing no impatience.

"Hmm, find someone and inform Xu Xiangning that I've started making progress on her request."

Hong Ye was an excellent hunter, knowing how to manipulate his prey. This tactic was one he had devised himself.

Hong Ye knew the balance between pressure and relief, luring Xu Xiangning into his trap step by step.

Moreover, he had been playing this game for a long time; it was time to give Xu Xiangning some rewards, preventing her from developing rebellious thoughts—otherwise, it would be a loss.

"Remember to tell her after you've informed her that I'm out of town."

Hong Ye mused for a moment before adding a final instruction: "As for how much to say and what to say, you should know well. I trust you."

"Yes, Master Hong. Please rest assured," the subordinate replied, "I will handle it immediately."

A master's command was never questioned; thus, they agreed and assured Hong Ye they would complete the task.

Seeing their prompt response, Hong Ye's satisfaction increased. He nodded and said to this subordinate: "You've worked hard; I will reward you after this task is done."

Leadership required a balance of strictness and leniency; one must not be too lax or too harsh, lest subordinates develop rebellious thoughts and turn a task that could have been done in one day into three or four.

Thus, after issuing the command, Hong Ye also promised a reward, and he was never stingy when it came to being generous.

Hearing Hong Ye's words, the subordinate's expression brightened and he quickly thanked Hong Ye: "Thank you, Master Hong. We will do our best to serve Master Hong!"

The subordinates reaffirmed their loyalty before quickly and tactfully leaving, not disturbing Hong Ye's affairs.

After they left, Hong Ye's smile faded, and his expression darkened considerably.

Hong Ye did not resume his previous task but instead fell into deep thought.

He rested one hand on his cheek, the other on the table.

His fingers tapped rhythmically on the surface, producing a steady sound.

Yet his expression was grave, leaving no one to know what he was thinking.

This Su Nan Tian—once found, it would be interesting to see who he truly was.

Hong Ye stopped his finger tapping and suddenly whispered, speaking only to himself: "Once found, it would be interesting."

Quickly, Hong Ye returned his thoughts and resumed his work without further distractions.

He thought that no matter how much he speculated now, it would be better to wait until he met Su Nan Tian and then carefully consider the matter. This way, it would save a lot of time.

Meanwhile, Su Nan Tian continued his peaceful life in the small fishing village.

He had no idea that a lost memory contained so much history.

Nor did he know he had become the object of desire for so many people, with so many searching for him.

Su Nan Tian knew the nature of these villains; although he had previously defeated and intimidated them, he knew that people like them would soon regain their composure and feel discontent. They would surely return again.

Thus, Su Nan Tian patrolled the hills every day to check for any unwise individuals.

It seemed his intimidation had worked; after three days, these villains did not appear again and dared not enter the fishing village.

Seeing that these villains were at least sensible, Su Nan Tian's mood eased slightly.

Of course, if they dared to return, he would not hesitate to act decisively.

"Wang Brother, are you going to patrol the hills again?"

When Su Nan Tian returned, he met Xiao Chen coming back from fishing. He smiled broadly, showing a row of white teeth and immediately asked with concern: "Ah, just checking around."

Su Nan Tian did not hide it and nodded in response.

"Wang Brother! You're so strong; you scared those villains away completely. They should not dare to come back!"

Xiao Chen laughed and praised Su Nan Tian, adding a rebuke of the villains.

Su Nan Tian only smiled but said nothing.

Caution leads to long-term safety; one must always be watchful to avoid major mistakes.

"But Xiao Chen, why did you return so early today?"

Su Nan Tian glanced at the sun; it was still early.

The villagers of the fishing village went to fish until sunset.

"Ihehe, I have something to do in town today," Xiao Chen laughed again and scratched his head, feeling embarrassed: "My sister is back on vacation; I need to go to town to pick her up."

Saying this, Xiao Chen asked: "Wang Brother, do you want to come with me? You've been here almost a month and haven't gone out yet."

Su Nan Tian had originally wanted to refuse, but upon hearing Xiao Chen's words, he thought it made sense. After thinking for a moment, he nodded.

"Good, I have time now; let's go to town together."

Su Nan Tian was also curious about the outside world of the fishing village.

It was a good opportunity to explore and get familiar with nearby areas.

Xiao Chen was also very happy, patting his chest and promising to be Su Nan Tian's guide.

Chapter 797: Hero Saves the Beauty

"Li Ge, I'm sure you'll find it interesting once you go out!"

This short distance was enough for Xiao Chen to change his address of Su Nan Tian from "Wang Brother" to "Li Ge," instantly closing the gap and making their relationship closer.

Su Nan Tian naturally noticed Xiao Chen's change in address, but it was just a name; Su Nan Tian did not care about such details. He simply pretended not to hear it.

Moreover, Su Nan Tian liked Xiao Chen, so no matter how he addressed him, Su Nan Tian would not mind. He smiled gently in return, showing his approval.

When they arrived at the town, Xiao Chen indeed fulfilled his promise and diligently performed as a guide, constantly introducing Su Nan Tian to the town's scenery, making it seem like Su Nan Tian was truly a tourist.

Not only that, but Xiao Chen also took Su Nan Tian to taste the local delicacies and foods, constantly taking care of him.

When it was time to pay, Xiao Chen insisted on paying.

How could Su Nan Tian allow that?

He immediately went to pay first, giving Xiao Chen no chance to pay.

Xiao Chen saw Su Nan Tian always paying and felt guilty, constantly thinking he should pay first but failed to outpace Su Nan Tian.

"Ah! Li Ge, why are you like this? You already treated me for free after those villains hit my head. I've owed you so much already. Now you don't even give me a chance to show my gratitude; I'm about to feel guilty!"

Xiao Chen slapped his back and honestly said what he felt.

After saying this, Xiao Chen looked at Su Nan Tian with a pout, hoping for an opportunity to show his gratitude.

Su Nan Tian found it amusing; in his mind, it was just a meal's cost, and who paid made no difference. However, seeing Xiao Chen truly cared, he thought for a moment and found an excuse.

Su Nan Tian's excuse was excellent, leaving no room for Xiao Chen to object.

"Since you called me Li Ge, it means I'm your brother; as an older brother, how could I take advantage of you? It's just a meal. We are brothers; we don't need to be divided."

When Su Nan Tian said this, he did not wait for Xiao Chen to think it over but immediately asked: "Isn't that the case?"

"Yes, that's right."

Xiao Chen did not react immediately and thought it was indeed the case.

After hearing Xiao Chen's words, Su Nan Tian nodded again: "That's good; don't let these small issues affect our brotherly bond."

After speaking, Su Nan Tian patted Xiao Chen's shoulder and moved on to another topic, completely shifting Xiao Chen's attention.

Xiao Chen was thus successfully persuaded by Su Nan Tian's logic, and in the following instances, it was always Su Nan Tian who paid.

Every time Xiao Chen tried to pay first, Su Nan Tian would use this excuse to silence him.

Xiao Chen could not find a way to argue with Su Nan Tian, and throughout the journey, he was always taken care of by Su Nan Tian.

However, Xiao Chen was not truly naive; he knew that Su Nan Tian did this for his own good. Thus, he silently remembered Su Nan Tian's kindness and planned to repay him in the future.

Xiao Chen's sister, Chen Xiaoling, was studying at a university in town. She had to transfer to the town before returning to the village to meet Xiao Chen.

During this time, Xiao Chen played a dedicated role as a guide, showing Su Nan Tian around the town's delicious foods, interesting places, and sights.

But this was a small place; although it was much more prosperous than the fishing village, it was still just a market town. Even with Xiao Chen's eloquence describing it as wonderful, they quickly finished touring.

Xiao Chen had originally boasted he would show Su Nan Tian around the entire town, but it was done so quickly that Xiao Chen felt a bit guilty.

Moreover, there was still a long time before the bus for Chen Xiaoling arrived, so they first went to a teahouse and sat down to drink tea while waiting for her.

Xiao Chen felt it was awkward to have Su Nan Tian wait with him, and as a young man who loved to chat, he sat down only for a moment before immediately starting a conversation with Su Nan Tian.

Xiao Chen first spoke about the town's affairs, then about the fishing village, and eventually brought up his sister.

"Li Ge, have you not met Xiaoling yet? She's a smart girl; she was always smart since childhood. She's also pretty, and Xiaoling is the first female college student from our fishing village—very rare!"

When Xiao Chen spoke about his sister, his expression was joyous and genuine. He also showed pride in continuing: "And it's not just me boasting; my sister is the village beauty, famous for her looks. Oh! Li Ge, you're missing out!"

"Who cares? You'll see her soon enough!"

Su Nan Tian found it amusing again. He thought of Uncle Wang praising Xiao Wang, and perhaps in the eyes of family members, their relatives were always the best in the world, deserving all praise and not to be denied by anyone.

What about me?

Su Nan Tian thought of this, and his thoughts paused momentarily; his expression became strangely nostalgic.

Did his family also see him like this?

Or did he have no family at all?

After thinking of these, Su Nan Tian's expression grew heavier. Even if there were family members, he had lost his memory and could not remember them now.

Meanwhile, Xiao Chen was so engrossed in talking that he did not notice Su Nan Tian's change in expression. He continued happily:

"Li Ge, you don't know; before Xiaoling went to college outside the village, she was always around our house. Every day, different people came by; there was never a quiet moment!"

At this point, Xiao Chen gave Su Nan Tian a meaningful glance and said: "They thought I couldn't see what they were thinking. They were just after my sister!"

"Hmph! But they're dreaming; they're frogs trying to eat swan meat!"

Xiao Chen said this and showed a resentful expression, snorting. He felt these people's admiration for Chen Xiaoling was an insult to her beauty.

Although they were good brothers who would go through fire for each other, Xiao Chen felt that the men of the fishing village were not worthy of his sister.

Moreover, Xiao Chen believed that Chen Xiaoling had worked harder and suffered more to escape from this small village.

If she married a man from the fishing village, she would repeat the same life here.

Xiao Chen did not want his sister to suffer; on the other hand, he felt that the men of the fishing village were not suitable for Chen Xiaoling. This was why he said these words.

At this point, Xiao Chen paused and seemed to think of something before looking at Su Nan Tian seriously: "But Li Ge, you are different. I've always thought you're stronger than anyone else."

Xiao Chen spoke sincerely to Su Nan Tian, but this was his genuine feeling. After all, Su Nan Tian had become a legend in the fishing village after one battle.

His strengths were countless, and it seemed there was nothing Su Nan Tian could not do.

No matter what he did, even if it was something he had never done before, his ability to learn was far superior to others. Once Su Nan Tian started learning seriously, he could quickly master it and surpass those who had already mastered it.

Thus, in Xiao Chen's eyes, Su Nan Tian was a legendary figure.

The more Xiao Chen thought about this, the more he believed that only someone as strong as Su Nan Tian was worthy of his sister.

At this point, Xiao Chen had an idea and looked at Su Nan Tian seriously: "Li Ge, since you're single, and my sister is also single, why don't the two of you get together?"

Xiao Chen said this and felt that he had been protecting his sister for so long, preventing the village's rowdy youths from approaching her. This was all preparation for this moment.

He had already foreseen the connection between Su Nan Tian and Chen Xiaoling.

Su Nan Tian was the first doctor in the fishing village; if his sister married him, she would never have a hard life. Moreover, Su Nan Tian knew so much and had so many skills; Chen Xiaoling would definitely have a good life.

Thinking of this, Xiao Chen continued to praise Su Nan Tian's strengths and spoke like a matchmaker.

"Li Ge, I'm not lying to you; this is my sincere heart, and it's also the consensus of everyone in the village. My sister isn't just excellent; she's also very pretty! I've lived here for years and have never seen a girl more beautiful than my sister!"

Chen Xiaoling was petite, her height barely reaching 1.6 meters, but beauty made up for it.

Her eyes were truly worthy of her name—lively and large, with dark pupils that looked like precious gems.

Moreover, Chen Xiaoling was unlike the villagers; her skin was white and smooth, as if it could be pierced.

In Xiao Chen's eyes, his sister was perfect and excellent; he now longed to conjure her out of thin air so Su Nan Tian could see for himself.

"Really, I'm not lying to you, Li Ge."

Xiao Chen continued his recommendation and felt this plan was more feasible. If Su Nan Tian and Chen Xiaoling were together, it would be a perfect match!

Xiao Chen said this and looked at Su Nan Tian, earnestly recommending.

But looking at Su Nan Tian's exquisite face and his aura of nobility, Xiao Chen immediately swallowed a mouthful of saliva and left some room: "Of course, my sister's looks are slightly inferior to yours."

When he said 'slightly,' Xiao Chen extended his fingers, making a small point. He quickly pushed it to Su Nan Tian: "But Li Ge! In our village, my sister is the most beautiful girl! Would you consider it?"

Xiao Chen had now truly decided to matchmake them, shifting from his initial introduction to this sales pitch. He seemed eager to match Su Nan Tian with Chen Xiaoling.

Upon hearing Xiao Chen's words, Su Nan Tian immediately found it amusing.

This topic had been going well, but why did it turn to his own life? And this important matter of marriage.

If Su Nan Tian were truly Uncle Wang's nephew and a resident of the fishing village, he would have been moved by Xiao Chen's introduction. He wouldn't mind trying with this girl he hadn't met yet, and perhaps it would be a good match.

But Su Nan Tian knew the truth about his origins; he hadn't figured out who he was, and he had forgotten a crucial memory. Once he thought of this, Su Nan Tian could not accept this marriage proposal. He would never want to burden Chen Xiaoling.

He had too many unknowns and secrets yet to uncover.

Before that, Su Nan Tian would not consider his own marriage.

His most important task now was to uncover what memory he had lost and determine who he truly was.

In fact, Su Nan Tian was also very curious about his identity. Even without memory, one's intelligence did not change, and the skills he had learned before would never be forgotten.

This was why Su Nan Tian could face those villains without hesitation, fearlessly driving them away and making them powerless.

Chapter 798: Matchmaking

Through these repeated experiments, Su Nan Tian constantly discovered his abilities. Just thinking of so many strengths made him certain he was no ordinary person.

The more he thought this, the deeper his obsession became; the more he wanted to uncover his true identity.

But every time Su Nan Tian tried to meditate, besides a severe headache that felt like it would explode, he found nothing.

No memories resurfaced; the fragmented glimpses of memory had vanished like stones sinking into water, never to stir again.

Thinking of this, Su Nan Tian's mood gradually darkened; his expression was no longer as light.

Xiao Chen, however, did not know what Su Nan Tian was thinking or the secrets he carried.

At this moment, Xiao Chen continued to promote his sister, desperately trying to match Su Nan Tian with Chen Xiaoling.

Xiao Chen had initially mentioned it casually, but after bringing it up, he felt the more he thought about it, the more feasible it seemed.

Since Su Nan Tian had saved him and driven away the village villains, Xiao Chen completely regarded Su Nan Tian as his hero.

He thought that if Su Nan Tian truly got together with Chen Xiaoling, they would become family.

Just imagining this scene made Xiao Chen dream of laughing himself awake.
