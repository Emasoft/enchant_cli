“Hahahaha! Good! Since that’s the case, let us return now and acquaint you with the environment.” Nan Gong Ping joyfully rose from his seat, then invited Su Nantian to accompany him back to the Nan Gong family. Naturally, Su Nantian did not refuse and immediately followed behind Nan Gong Ping as they walked out.

After Nan Gong Ping left, the assistant of the Nan Gong family immediately addressed Nan Gong Yu Yan: “Miss, you see… should we continue…”

“No more. I’m leaving too. It’s time to go to the hospital and check on Zhang Yu.” After speaking these words, Nan Gong Yu Yan immediately rose. She had no interest in remaining here to watch further, so she also led her people away. This left those who had hoped to showcase their skills in awe, surprised that the Nan Gong family had again taken someone back after such a long time—but it was not them.

As Su Nantian sat in the car with Nan Gong Ping returning to the Nan Gong family, the information about Su Nantian that Nan Gong Ping had commissioned was already relayed. Nan Gong Ping smiled at Su Nantian and picked up his phone to review the details. At this point, Su Nantian was absolutely unaware of what he was doing.

Thus, Nan Gong Ping examined the information about Su Nantian on his phone while asking questions.

“Nantian, since you’ve joined me, may I inquire about some details regarding you?” Nan Gong Ping was quite polite.

Su Nantian nodded and replied, “No problem. Ask whatever you wish.”

“How did you learn about our Nan Gong family? Why go to Tianshui Building? Considering your skills, you could find a good position anywhere. Why specifically here?”

As Nan Gong Ping spoke, he glanced at the description of Su Nantian on his phone. The content was identical to what Su Nantian had fabricated while in the taxi with the driver.

“Oh, I’m just a villager from a small village. An old man there had no children and I took care of him in his final days. Before he died, he told me that if I wanted to rise and earn a fortune, I could rely on my skills to join the Nan Gong family at Tianshui Building. So I came. Compared to farming, this is far more lucrative.”

Nan Gong Ping reviewed the data he had obtained and found it matched Su Nantian’s account. Moreover, they had not misjudged the old man who had advised Su Nantian to approach the Nan Gong family—this old man indeed had a connection with the Nan Gong family.

After asking Su Nantian several other questions, Nan Gong Ping was thoroughly convinced of his background. His heart eased, and he said: “First, let’s take you home to meet our family patriarch. All new recruits must pass through him. You must perform well; if the patriarch does not approve, I cannot help you. Understand?”

Su Nantian was unaware of this rule within the Nan Gong family, and his heart gave a slight jolt. He knew that although Nan Gong Ping appeared weak, his father was certainly no fool.

After reviewing the records of the five major families in Kyoto, Su Nantian had formed a deep impression of Nan Gong Lin. Previously, the Nan Gong family had been on the decline under his grandfather’s era; the company and people within the family were increasingly scattered, and their fortune had deteriorated. Nan Gong Lin’s father was an ordinary man who could manage the household but failed to extricate the family from its困境. In contrast, Nan Gong Lin had shown remarkable talent since childhood—attaining a major deal at thirteen and managing the family’s affairs by fifteen. Though his father was nominally the head of the household, everyone implicitly accepted Nan Gong Lin’s position.

Thus, there was no contest for succession in Nan Gong Lin’s generation. His uncles and cousins all willingly assisted him, knowing that only through Nan Gong Lin could the family regain its former glory.

Indeed, under Nan Gong Lin’s leadership, the family had recovered from decline and begun to rise again. This event left Su Nantian with a deep impression of Nan Gong Lin, and now learning that the final test to enter the Nan Gong family required passing Nan Gong Lin’s inspection, Su Nantian felt a slight tension.

Chapter 454: The Estate

As the car moved forward, Su Nantian observed the changing scenery outside. Eventually, they arrived at a place resembling a private estate. However, Su Nantian could only see a small building in the distance from nearly half a kilometer away.

After passing through an extremely secure gate, they finally entered the Nan Gong family’s private residence.

Su Nantian looked ahead and realized that the Nan Gong family’s private estate was a classic Chinese-style mansion with vast grounds, resembling a corner of an ancient palace.

“Wow, truly no wonder he was once an emperor…” Su Nantian muttered internally.

However, after the car passed, Su Nantian realized that only the front buildings were in this retro style. Behind them were several small villas hidden among trees, not appearing too out of place with this style but still carrying a modern feel.

This must be where the Nan Gong family members reside individually.

“Get out. Let’s first meet my father. If he accepts you, I’ll show you around my territory.” Nan Gong Ping said as the servant opened the car door. Su Nantian quickly followed.

“Where’s my father?” Nan Gong Ping asked the man accompanying him as they walked forward.

Su Nantian observed the man, who was around fifty years old. He wore a traditional Chinese robe and appeared to be a household servant or steward.

Through the architectural style of the Nan Gong family, Su Nantian could also guess that this retro design was where Nan Gong Lin resided. The subsequent small villas were for other family members, as such a large family would not live together.

“Father is inside having tea. Young Master, you went to Tianshui Building, why did you return so quickly?” The steward looked back at Su Nantian and asked hesitantly: “Have you already chosen someone?”

This was indeed unusual compared to usual. Everyone knew the Nan Gong family’s selection criteria were ruthless; they didn’t require high education, but one must have real talent. If not strict, it wouldn’t explain why Nan Gong Ping and Nan Gong Yu Yan had only brought back two people from Tianshui Building, and with Su Nantian added today, it was only three people. Whether Su Nantian would truly enter the Nan Gong family remained uncertain.

“Yes, he’s very strong. He broke Zhang Yu’s leg.” Nan Gong Lin nodded, speaking with excitement and a hint of pride on his face. It seemed that Nan Gong Ping had long been discontent with Zhang Yu, as no one was stronger than him. Now this person willingly joined his ranks, and he felt delighted.

The steward was shocked upon hearing Nan Gong Ping’s words: “What? This boy defeated Zhang Yu?” His face showed disbelief.

“Yes, you didn’t see Yu Yan return? She went to the hospital. His leg was broken; if he recovers, he can still maintain his strength. If not, he may never recover to his peak.” Nan Gong Ping said this without the slightest regret. After all, Zhang Yu was not his person; even if Zhang Yu were strong, he wouldn’t protect a single toe.

As they spoke, they walked forward. Su Nantian followed behind until they passed through a living room and climbed the stairs to Nan Gong Lin’s study.

The study door was open, so Su Nantian could immediately recognize the face with the photo in his records of Kyoto’s five major families. This was indeed Nan Gong Lin.

“Master, the Young Master has returned. He brought someone from Tianshui Building to meet you.” The steward said and entered, while Nan Gong Ping remained at the door.

This revealed the strict rules within the Nan Gong family and how its members adhered to them.

“Who did you bring back?” Nan Gong Lin set down his teacup and asked.

“He must be a martial artist. I heard he defeated Zhang Yu and broke his leg. Miss Yu Yan is currently accompanying him to the hospital.” The steward relayed this.

“What? You said Zhang Yu was defeated and his leg broken? This person is that strong?” Nan Gong Lin clearly did not believe it. After speaking, he immediately stood up and continued: “If he’s a martial artist, this study is not suitable for testing. Let’s go to the living room; it’s more spacious.”

Thus, Nan Gong Lin walked out and waved at Su Nantian and others to follow him into the living room.

Nan Gong Lin sat on the sofa, gazing at Su Nantian before turning to look at Nan Gong Ping beside him. “This is your acquisition from Tianshui Building? I heard he was very strong, defeating Zhang Yu so thoroughly?”

“Yes, Father. This Nantian is truly strong. I saw it with my own eyes. Miss Yu Yan also knows.” Nan Gong Ping replied.

“Good, then let’s test him. Since he is a martial artist, a sparring match would be more practical.” After saying this, Nan Gong Lin looked at Su Nantian and said: “What do you think? Now I’ll have my bodyguard fight him. If he wins, he stays with the Nan Gong family.”

“Father? With your bodyguard? Are you planning to send Zeng Chao?” Nan Gong Ping looked shocked upon hearing this.

Although Su Nantian did not know who Zeng Chao was, merely seeing Nan Gong Ping’s reaction made him guess that this bodyguard must be a formidable figure—more powerful than Zhang Yu.

Nan Gong Lin nodded: “Yes. This boy broke Zhang Yu’s leg, so he must be much stronger than Zhang Yu. Therefore, this test requires someone stronger than Zhang Yu to assess his skills. If I find a strong person, I’ll be at ease.”

“But Zeng Chao is too fierce. He might not even last a few moves. It would be too hard for him to win.” Nan Gong Ping shook his head. Though he knew the test was under his father’s responsibility, he still hoped to retain Su Nantian. However, if Zeng Chao were to fight him, it would be risky.

Chapter 455: Second Test

Upon hearing his son’s words, Nan Gong Lin thought it made sense. If he sent Zeng Chao, a strong fighter, and the person failed, it would be a waste of talent. Earlier, he had been angry because this person had broken Zhang Yu’s leg.

“Then let’s say if he can endure a hundred moves against Zeng Chao, he’ll stay. That should be acceptable.” Nan Gong Lin changed his approach.

Nan Gong Ping looked at Su Nantian and said: “Nantian, a very strong person will now fight you. If you can endure a hundred moves against him, you’ll stay with the Nan Gong family. If not, you must leave. Do you agree?”

Su Nantian had no fear of anyone and nodded immediately: “I understand. I’ll give it my all.”

Hearing this, Nan Gong Ping replied: “Alright, then call Zeng Chao over.”

Thus, the steward of the Nan Gong family summoned Zeng Chao, the head bodyguard and number one in strength among the Nan Gong family’s guards.

To describe Zeng Chao’s strength: although he ranked first in the Nan Gong family and was comparable to the third-ranked Zhang Yu, he could easily defeat Zhang Yu. Previously, they had fought and Zeng Chao subdued him in two moves, directly seizing his vital point.

Therefore, Zeng Chao’s strength was top-tier and unmatched.

After a few minutes, a man entered the living room wearing a short-sleeved T-shirt. He had a neat buzz cut and bandages on his hands, indicating he practiced boxing regularly.

“Master, Young Master. You called me.” Zeng Chao bowed respectfully and did not even glance at Su Nantian before standing beside him.

“Zeng Chao, you’re here. This time Young Ping went to Tianshui Building and found a bodyguard. His skills are good. Test him.” Nan Gong Lin said, but his tone was as if speaking to a friend, showing no sign of employer-employee relationship.

Upon hearing this, Zeng Chao turned to look at Su Nantian beside him and waved his hand: “Master, this is too dangerous. You know my skills. If Young Ping truly seeks a strong person, I can have one of my men test him. If he wins, he’s qualified to be by Young Ping’s side. But if I fight him, I fear injuring him.”

Actually, Zeng Chao was not being arrogant; his skills were unmatched. He was concerned for Su Nantian’s safety.

“Ah, this matter must be you. This young man defeated Zhang Yu in Tianshui Building and broke his leg. I think my men can’t beat him. You must personally test him. Both of you fight; if he endures a hundred moves, I’ll let him stay with Young Ping.” Nan Gong Lin continued.

“What?” Zeng Chao clearly did not believe this person could defeat Zhang Yu and injure him so severely. This was too unbelievable for him.

Upon hearing this news, Zeng Chao who had no interest in Su Nantian now looked at him with more attention. He could not believe that the person beside him had such skills, as he was a bodyguard and could easily distinguish the energy of martial artists. For his profession, one must always be alert, and those with such high skills would naturally radiate a killing aura. However, this person had none.

This indicated two things: either the person was lucky and defeated Zhang Yu without knowing what happened, or he was truly a master who could hide his energy and not reveal his sharpness.

If it were the latter, Zeng Chao would find it hard to determine whether he could beat this person. Moreover, Su Nantian’s expression was neutral and unreadable, making it hard for Zeng Chao to understand his emotions. This unsettled him.

But since Nan Gong Lin had ordered the fight, he must do it. Thus, Zeng Chao waved to Su Nantian and said: “Come on, prepare for the fight.”

Su Nantian did not hesitate. He stepped back, and the Nan Gong family’s living room was large enough for two to fight. Thus, they each retreated to opposite sides and prepared to start the match.

Su Nantian could see Zeng Chao’s level was indeed high. Compared to Qiyexu, he might be at a similar level, but this level was still not impressive to him. Moreover, Su Nantian did not intend to defeat Zeng Chao; he just wanted to endure a hundred moves. He understood that revealing too much strength would be dangerous.

His goal was to infiltrate the martial family, so staying with Nan Gong Ping was sufficient. If he showed more strength than Zeng Chao, he might end up under Nan Gong Lin instead of Nan Gong Ping. His goal to enter the martial family would then be lost.

Thus, Su Nantian’s strategy was clear: endure a hundred moves and do not need to defeat Zeng Chao.

“Come on!” As Su Nantian was thinking about this, Zeng Chao roared and attacked. Su Nantian did not hesitate but rushed toward Zeng Chao immediately. He needed no tricks; he just had to use his strength. Enduring a hundred moves against Zeng Chao was simple.

Thus, Su Nantian launched the first attack. He threw a straight punch toward Zeng Chao’s abdomen, but Zeng Chao was experienced and understood his intention immediately. He stepped back, but this was not just a retreat; he changed direction.

As Zeng Chao retreated, he turned to the side of Wang Dan and aimed to attack Su Nantian’s exposed flank. However, Su Nantian was not naive; he changed the trajectory of his fist and swung it toward Zeng Chao.

Chapter 456: Ruthless Moves

Zeng Chao had expected to fight this person without using his full strength, but after one round he realized he could not be careless. This person’s strength exceeded his expectations. Although Zeng Chao had heard Nan Gong Lin say this young man had sent Zhang Yu to the hospital, he still thought he was much stronger than him.

After all, there was an unbridgeable gap between himself and Zhang Yu. Even if this person was stronger than Zhang Yu, he could not surpass him so easily. However, he had underestimated this person.

Thus, Zeng Chao was now fully energized and raised his focus to the maximum. He prepared to face this test seriously.

Nan Gong Lin also noticed Zeng Chao’s expression and was greatly surprised. He rarely saw this look on Zeng Chao’s face before; when he did, it meant he was now serious.

Nan Gong Lin thought this young man must be truly strong to have forced Zeng Chao into seriousness.

“Unexpectedly, you do have some real skills. I underestimated you. That you sent Zhang Yu to the hospital shows your strength is indeed remarkable.” Zeng Chao finally dodged Su Nantian’s punch and said this to him.

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian smiled but did not respond. He continued attacking Zeng Chao.

Su Nantian had no time to chat with Zeng Chao. He just wanted to endure these hundred moves quickly. If he did not need to hold back his strength, he would have defeated Zeng Chao immediately.

Zeng Chao did not expect this person to fight without hesitation. He ignored Zeng Chao’s words and suddenly felt slighted, which made him extremely angry.

Thus, with his seriousness and anger, Zeng Chao’s attacks became more intense and fierce.

“My god, how long has it been since I saw Zeng Chao so serious.” At this moment, Nan Gong Ping was also surprised and said.

“Ha ha, it seems you’ve really found a treasure this time. This person from Tianshui Building is indeed very strong. You used to say your sister’s bodyguard was much stronger than yours. If this person passes the test, then your men will be even stronger.” Nan Gong Lin also smiled and said this.

Nan Gong Ping heard this and immediately replied: “Father, you know my bodyguards are not as strong as your sister’s. Why don’t you just let him pass the test? If he fails, I would lose a major general.”

Nan Gong Lin smiled but shook his head: “Although this Nantian has skills and ability, entering our Nan Gong family is not just about that. I always test to filter for both of you.”

Nan Gong Ping knew he could not change his father’s mind, so he did not mention it again. He focused back on Zeng Chao and Su Nantian.

At this moment, Zeng Chao and Su Nantian were fighting evenly. They exchanged blows fiercely.

Moreover, it must be said that Zeng Chao’s punches now became deadly and ruthless.

Because Zeng Chao was like this: if he felt the opponent looked down on him, he would become extremely angry and attack with ruthless ferocity.

Su Nantian did not expect that for such a reason, Zeng Chao would attack so heavily. It was just a test, but it felt like they were enemies.

Because of this, Su Nantian gradually felt a small anger. The more Zeng Chao attacked him, the more determined he became to resist Zeng Chao’s moves.

However, Su Nantian felt very constrained fighting like this. He could easily defeat Zeng Chao but had to hold back his strength to conceal it.

While Su Nantian was thinking this, Zeng Chao kept attacking his head.

Su Nantian immediately became furious because this was one of the body’s vital points. With such force, a normal person would die instantly.

Su Nantian gritted his teeth and realized the opponent truly wanted to kill him. Why should he hold back?

Thus, Su Nantian slightly stepped back and dodged this move in the shortest distance.

Zeng Chao, seeing his first punch missed, immediately followed up with another. However, he did not expect this second punch made Su Nantian even more furious.

Su Nantian decided to no longer hold back. He immediately extended his hand and used an eagle’s claw to seize Zeng Chao’s arm joint. Zeng Chao tried to pull back his arm but found it tightly gripped, unable to retreat.

Thus, Zeng Chao used his other hand to punch Su Nantian’s chest, hoping to force him to release his wrist.

But Zeng Chao did not expect this punch was very fast, but Su Nantian precisely seized the joint of this hand.

Now Zeng Chao’s two hands were both controlled by Su Nantian. He could neither attack nor retreat.

Thus, Zeng Chao used one leg to sweep at Su Nantian. However, when he kicked out his leg, he regretted it immediately but could not undo it. He suddenly remembered that Zhang Yu had been sent to the hospital because of this Su Nantian.

Zeng Chao thought Zhang Yu was stronger in leg techniques, so he could not retrieve his leg and would inevitably hit a wall.

Indeed, Su Nantian did not dodge but kicked toward the direction of Zeng Chao’s leg. When their legs met, Zeng Chao felt a sharp pain that spread throughout his entire leg.

At this moment, Su Nantian applied more force and heard a crack. Zeng Chao’s hand joint was broken by Su Nantian.

Nan Gong Lin and Nan Gong Ping were shocked. They had not expected Zeng Chao to face such an opponent. They originally thought Su Nantian was stronger than Zhang Yu but not Zeng Chao, as there was an unbridgeable gap between them.

But now they realized this person was truly strong, and Zeng Chao was no match for him.

Chapter 457: Passing the Test

As Su Nantian prepared to twist Zeng Chao’s other hand, Nan Gong Lin suddenly stood up from the sofa.

“Stop! Stop!” Nan Gong Lin clearly felt心疼. If Zeng Chao’s other hand was also broken, he would only have one good leg left.

Indeed, Zeng Chao had recklessly fought Su Nantian in a leg technique. His leg should have been broken like Zhang Yu’s. And his hand was already broken by Su Nantian. If this hand were also broken, he would truly have only one leg left.

“Right, stop!” Nan Gong Ping immediately stood up and walked toward Su Nantian.

Su Nantian heard this, remembered he had come to the Nan Gong family as a spy to infiltrate the martial family. Now was not the time to follow his temper. Normally, no matter if it was the Nan Gong family or any other family, Su Nantian would not stop. But now he took a deep breath and suppressed his anger, slowly releasing Zeng Chao’s other arm.

“Quickly call someone to take him to the hospital.” Although Nan Gong Lin was heartbroken, his family head demeanor remained. He did not panic and immediately ordered the steward to send Zeng Chao to the hospital.

Thus, under the steward’s command, four people rushed in with a stretcher and carried Zeng Chao out.

Nan Gong Lin and Nan Gong Ping sat back on the sofa. Nan Gong Lin leaned on his cane, tapping it repeatedly. After a while, he said: “You have guts, boy. This is my personal bodyguard. You dared to injure him so badly—broken hands and legs, it will take at least half a year to recover.”

“Three months. Considering Zeng Chao’s condition, if he recovers well in two months, he will be fine. People like him have stronger recovery abilities than others.” Su Nantian replied.

Upon hearing this, Nan Gong Ping became anxious. If Su Nantian continued to be so headstrong, his father might completely refuse to let him join the Nan Gong family. This would mean losing a major general.

“What are you saying? That’s your mistake. Why haven’t you apologized yet?” Nan Gong Ping quickly signaled Su Nantian with his eyes, indicating he should soften his attitude.

Su Nantian knew Nan Gong Ping wanted him to stay. So he should soften his attitude, but for some reason, Su Nantian did not want to yield at this moment.

Nan Gong Lin looked at him and after a while turned to Nan Gong Ping: “You’ve found a good person this time. His skills are indeed great, but I didn’t expect him to be so ruthless. Zeng Chao was just testing him, and he already crippled one hand or leg.”

“Father, it was just a test. An accident. You saw him stop when you told him to.” Nan Gong Ping felt something was wrong and was very angry. It seemed Su Nantian would not stay. But he still wanted to try, so he kept defending Su Nantian.

“Although we were fighting, Zeng Chao was the one who attacked me first. Should I not retaliate? I crippled his leg unintentionally, and he dared to fight with me in a leg technique. Moreover, my kick was just defensive. You two sitting there should have seen clearly. I crippled his hand because it attacked my vital point. If he had hit me, I would be the one lying on the ground now and couldn’t even be saved.”

Su Nantian said this while being very angry. He thought about Zeng Chao’s unjustified attacks during the test and felt even more resentful.

“Enough, enough. It was just a test. Let’s forget about it.” Nan Gong Ping waved his hand to signal Su Nantian not to speak further, as the more he spoke, the angrier his father became.

At this moment, Nan Gong Lin stood up and tapped the ground with his cane. “Alright, your skills are indeed great. You may stay.” After saying this, Nan Gong Lin directly turned and went upstairs.

Nan Gong Ping saw this but was completely confused. His father clearly seemed angry, and it looked like he would not allow Su Nantian to join the Nan Gong family. But why did he finally agree?

“What’s going on…” Nan Gong Ping grabbed the steward who was about to follow upstairs and asked.

“Master, just know that you’ve found someone who stays. As for whether the master is angry or not, Zeng Chao has been with him as a bodyguard. Now he’s injured; of course, he feels心疼. I’m even happier that you found such a talent. It’s rare to find someone stronger than Zeng Chao. Congratulations, Master. I’ll go up to see the master now. You can do as you wish.”

The steward smiled and said this to Nan Gong Ping before also going upstairs.

Nan Gong Ping couldn’t figure it out, but Su Nantian understood clearly. He immediately realized what Nan Gong Lin’s feelings were.

It was reluctance.

Nan Gong Lin was reluctant to let him go because his skills were much stronger than Zeng Chao. Having such a person by Nan Gong Ping’s side made him feel more at ease. Thus, even though he was very angry now, his reason could still suppress his anger.

He knew that if Nan Gong Ping had such a bodyguard, it would be very safe for the family.

But this did not mean he forgave Su Nantian. Surely, after officially entering the Nan Gong family, Su Nantian would face a series of small retaliations.

“Never mind. I can’t figure it out. This person is very sharp, and he doesn’t say what’s on his mind. I don’t understand what they’re thinking. But since you’ve stayed, it’s a good thing. From today on, you officially enter the Nan Gong family and become my personal bodyguard. Now you’re even stronger than Zeng Chao. I’ve gained the number one bodyguard, and it’s a bit exciting.”

After saying this, Nan Gong Ping immediately walked out of the house and extended his hand to Su Nantian: “Come on, don’t stay here. This is our family patriarch’s house. My house is behind. You’ll be with me, so you should live behind.”

Su Nantian nodded and immediately followed Nan Gong Ping out. They left the main house of Nan Gong Lin, and behind were their respective villas.

Although these villas were numerous, they had different scales. Clearly, two of them stood out among the rest. If Su Nantian was not mistaken, they belonged to Nan Gong Ping and his sister Nan Gong Yu Yan.

Chapter 458: Insight

Nan Gong Ping pointed to the two larger villas and said: “These are where my sister and I live. The one on the left is mine, and the other is my sister’s. Normally, don’t go over unless someone calls you. As for the others behind, there are also relatives of our Nan Gong family living there. You don’t need to listen to them. In the Nan Gong family, it’s still about status and position. You are my bodyguard, so you don’t need to worry about others. Just listen to our family patriarch. If anyone says something, you can come find me.”

Su Nantian had not expected Nan Gong Ping to be so arrogant and hold such a position within the Nan Gong family. However, he quickly understood: the Nan Gong family was revived by Nan Gong Lin. Since there were only two children, they both had status before the heir was determined. Moreover, it seemed the family had a distinction between direct and collateral lines, so others’ positions were naturally different.

It could be said that now it was a competition between Nan Gong Ping and Nan Gong Yu Yan. If one of them lost, the loser would face a similar fate.

However, this was not Su Nantian’s concern. This had nothing to do with him. He entered the Nan Gong family only to infiltrate the martial family. Now he had successfully passed the first step, and as long as he followed Nan Gong Ping, he would surely enter the martial family.

“Come with me. I’ll show you around the villa’s interior. Since you’re a bodyguard, not only must you follow me when I go out, but you must also take precautions at home. After all, you know many people in the Nan Gong family are envious and use underhanded methods. You must be vigilant. Previously, my bodyguards were not as good as Zhang Yu and Zeng Chao, but now with you, I feel much more at ease.”

Nan Gong Ping said this while patting Su Nantian’s shoulder. It was clear that Nan Gong Ping was truly satisfied with Su Nantian, as before this he had been a candidate for the heir. However, his bodyguards were completely inferior to those of his father and sister. This time he had truly made a name for himself, defeating Zhang Yu under his sister’s command and even Zeng Chao, the number one bodyguard. This was definitely a great honor for him.

Seeing Nan Gong Ping’s happy expression, Su Nantian sighed inwardly. From today’s interactions, he believed that if it were Nan Gong Lin, he would not choose Nan Gong Ping as the heir.

Nan Gong Ping seemed overly idealistic. When Su Nantian first met him, he thought Nan Gong Ping was intimidating and appeared as a cold aristocratic young man. But after getting to know him, he realized he was just a paper tiger and not capable.

After encountering certain situations, he could not provide an effective resolution. And when speaking, he gave a very childish impression compared to Nan Gong Yu Yan.

But regardless, Su Nantian observed everything from an outsider’s perspective with absolute rationality. However, if it were Nan Gong Lin’s perspective, it might not be the same thing.

In matters of children, no matter how wise a parent is, they cannot always make a rational decision. Otherwise, why would Nan Gong Lin have allowed both Nan Gong Ping and Nan Gong Yu Yan to be on the same level for so long? Even though Nan Gong Yu Yan was much better than Nan Gong Ping.
