A Dai's spiritual energy was surging wildly, consumed at an alarming rate. His feet pounded the ground with desperate urgency, and behind him, a sharp whistling sound echoed as a blade sliced past his face, piercing through a tree trunk the thickness of a basin.

The near-death experience nearly stole A Dai's soul, and his speed surged without restraint. He felt his steps growing lighter, yet his spiritual energy was rapidly depleted.

A Dai's breath grew shallow as he neared the place where he had met his master. When he burst from the forest and reached the spot where he had left, he found it empty—his master was gone.

His heart turned icy cold; realization struck him that he might perish here today, and his vengeance would remain unfulfilled. He feared death not for himself but because he had unfinished business. His family's fate depended on him; if he died, they would suffer unjustly even in hell.

Suddenly, A Dai halted, his eyes burning with fury as he glared at the youth. He flung a piece of meat toward him.

But the youth did not react as A Dai expected. He remained motionless, ignoring the meat discarded on the ground.

A Dai sensed this was more dangerous than he had anticipated.

"Boy, hand over the step technique you just used. I'll spare your life. You can take the meat too," the youth said, his gaze never leaving A Dai.

Upon hearing this, A Dai finally understood why he felt such a life-threatening presence. This man's goal was not the meat but the step technique his master had taught him.

A Dai now faced a dire dilemma. His only option was to fight with all his might. His advantage lay in speed, but his spiritual energy was nearly exhausted—his time was limited unless he could strike a decisive blow.

Yet A Dai knew he couldn't. The chance was almost nonexistent, but he had to try; otherwise, there would be no hope left.

"You're wasting your strength. Resistance is futile before absolute power," the youth said, his voice laced with contempt. "A cultivator of the second realm attempting to challenge me? That's a dream."

The youth toyed with his throwing knife, while A Dai stared at it. The youth's lips curled in mockery—how naive to think he could outmatch this.

*Shu!*

A Dai's eyes locked onto the knife, but he heard its whistling approach. By the time he reacted, his abdomen was already pierced.

A Dai gritted his teeth, glancing at the knife embedded in his waist. It was treacherous—this man had more than one blade.

But now, A Dai felt an opportunity. He too possessed a knife—this one lodged in his stomach.

"Ah, your will is quite firm. I wonder how many more blades you can endure," the youth said, his voice trailing off as he hurled another knife.

*Plop.*

This time, A Dai deliberately let the blade strike his left arm. The speed had been too fast; if he moved even a fraction slower, it would have pierced his heart.

The youth's pupils contracted sharply. He was bewildered—his target had been the heart, yet it struck A Dai's arm instead.

The youth withdrew three more knives from his sleeve. Upon seeing them, A Dai's heart sank to the depths.

Chapter 939: The Trial is Passed

Yet A Dai's mind remained calm, unshaken by fear. He had faced death countless times; even if he perished, he would leave the opponent wounded.

"Boy, this is your last chance. If you don't cherish it, you'll meet the Lord of Death," the youth said, intrigued by this man's defiance. He had never encountered someone so ungrateful—yet there was no fear in his eyes.

He relished the terror he instilled, but this time, it was absent. The youth resolved to torment him further.

With confidence, he had ample experience in making opponents beg for mercy without allowing them to end their lives.

As this thought crossed his mind, the youth's excitement surged. This matter had become more intriguing than the technique itself.

A Dai noticed the youth's strange smile, a chill creeping through him. He could not fathom what this man intended—surely nothing good.

A Dai had made up his mind: he would rather die than fall into the youth's hands.

In an instant, both men moved. As the youth hurled his knife, A Dai vanished from his spot, his form shifting unnaturally as he closed in for a close-range strike—perhaps there was still a chance.

The youth, angered by his first failure, withdrew three more knives and launched them at the white figure. This time, their trajectory was different—three blades aligned in a straight line.

A Dai cursed inwardly. He felt this strike was unavoidable, locked onto his next move. With a fierce resolve, he pulled the knife embedded in his abdomen and hurled it back at the same angle. Then, he yanked the knife from his shoulder and met the three incoming blades.

*Clang! Clang!*

*Plop. Plop.*

Four sounds echoed almost simultaneously.

A Dai dodged the first two, but the third struck his chest. Blood spewed from his mouth as he collapsed to the ground.

The youth felt a searing pain in his abdomen, his face contorting into a grotesque mask. He pulled the last remaining knife and aimed it at A Dai's neck, no longer interested in playing. The blade flew, seemingly destined to strike.

But the next moment, it fell to the ground, its blade fractured into two pieces. The youth stared in disbelief—never had he imagined his knife would break like this.

"Who?" the youth roared, scanning the dark forest. His body prickled with goosebumps; he was anxious—why hadn't Uncle Li arrived yet?

As he worried about his safety, a hand seized his shoulder. He was launched into the air, flying over ten zhang before crashing heavily to the ground.

A voice of despair echoed through the night, soon followed by a familiar tone.

"Master, are you alright?" A flustered middle-aged man emerged from the forest, rushing to lift the fallen master.

"Idiot! I'm injured—how could I be fine? If I die, my father will kill you," Wang Lin roared, spittle flying as he spat on the guard's face.

The middle-aged guard nodded repeatedly, too afraid to utter a word or show any displeasure.

"Those are the ones! Kill them!" Wang Lin pointed ahead. Though it was dark, he could still discern two figures in the night.

The middle-aged guard narrowed his eyes, cautious as he observed the two silhouettes. He sensed a faint aura from one and an unstable, erratic energy from another—clear signs of impending spiritual chaos.

He gently supported Wang Lin against a tree trunk. A powerful aura erupted, shaking the surrounding leaves into dust. Not a single leaf remained intact.

This power was overwhelming. Wang Lin smiled coldly, knowing this guard was loyal to him and would never defy his father's orders. His strength was formidable, ranking among the top ten in the Luo Shan Sect. He believed this guard could handle the opponent easily, his smile radiant as he envisioned the enemy groveling at his feet.

The middle-aged guard heard Wang Lin's arrogant laughter and felt irritation, but he was powerless. His wife and children were within the Luo Shan Sect; if anything happened to this young master, they might face death. He had no choice.

The guard took a step forward, leaving deep footprints in the earth, over a chi thick.

Su Nantian, however, had no regard for this. After briefly tending to A Dai's wounds and infusing a pure stream of spiritual energy to protect his internal organs, he stabilized A Dai's condition.

He was impressed by A Dai's performance. The boy had never yielded, nor had he surrendered the Cloud Shadow Step technique to save his life.

This was truly a test of A Dai's resolve, seeing if he would betray others under the threat of death.

Su Nantian was pleased with the result. He hadn't expected A Dai to be so resolute, choosing death over surrendering the technique.

He felt a strange familiarity with A Dai—though he couldn't recall his past, something about this moment felt eerily familiar. It was as if he had experienced it countless times before, like a routine.

After controlling A Dai's injuries, Su Nantian rose slowly. At that moment, the middle-aged guard was within two meters of him, his aura like a volcano ready to erupt.

Su Nantian didn't find this aura formidable but rather hollow, lacking true strength.

"Are you a cultivator?" Su Nantian asked abruptly. He had some understanding of his current situation but sought more information.

This might awaken memories deep within him, or if not, he could use external force to provoke a reaction.

The middle-aged guard stared at Su Nantian as if he were mad. Of course, he was a cultivator—his aura was clearly visible. Why ask such a question? Was it some kind of trick?

After scrutinizing him, the guard found no clues. Just as he prepared to attack and subdue Su Nantian, a sudden surge of immense energy radiated from him. Though fleeting, it was unmistakable.

After hesitating, he finally spoke: "Yes, I am a cultivator. Today, no matter what you say, you will die here."

Chapter 940: Frenzy

Su Nantian observed the man's aggressive demeanor, finding it amusing—like a child throwing a tantrum.

He decided to test whether fighting a cultivator could awaken his buried memories.

As the guard's words ended, his right fist ignited with a flame, surging forward with a roaring force toward Su Nantian's chest.

Yet Su Nantian stood unmoved, watching the guard's attack with calm indifference.

The guard sneered internally. This man was clearly weak. Hadn't he already attacked? Did he plan to withstand it with his body? That was a foolish hope. He had delivered one punch, and this man would either be dead or severely injured.

He was confident in his battle against Su Nantian's chest. But instead, he felt a wall—thick and solid.

The force was so immense it created a gust of wind around them. The guard's pupils contracted sharply, disbelief etched on his face. How could this man withstand his punch without a scratch? It was impossible.

The guard, undeterred, continued to strike with relentless punches. After several blows, his arms ached, yet the man still stood before him.

After numerous attacks, he retreated, staring at Su Nantian with terror. He couldn't fathom why this man was so resilient.

This feeling of helplessness only surfaced when facing the Grand Elder. How could this young man be as strong as the Grand Elder?

From a distance, Wang Lin watched the scene. He was thrilled when the guard delivered his powerful punch but was stunned by what followed—no one had ever withstood such a strike without falling.

This was beyond comprehension. A chill crept up his spine, fear gripping him. This man was like a demon—no human being.

His body instinctively recoiled.

The middle-aged guard, retreating tens of meters, stared at Su Nantian with awe. He couldn't comprehend how this was possible.

Su Nantian adjusted his wrinkled clothes and waved at the middle-aged guard. "You're not even close to your full strength, are you? Show me your true power."

"Boy, don't be overconfident. Arrogance leads to destruction," the guard replied, his mind racing. This man's calmness suggested hidden strength.

But why was such a powerful person here? What were his intentions?

Could he be targeting the Luo Shan Sect?

This thought unsettled him. If so, the sect was in danger and he needed to return immediately to inform the elders.

He thought of Master Wang. He had to survive; otherwise, his family would suffer. Their lives were uncertain.

He shouted, "Hurry back to the sect and report! I'll hold them off. Please take care of my wife and children, Master Wang. I'm eternally grateful for your kindness."

Wang Lin heard this and understood the guard couldn't defeat this man. Though he didn't want to accept it, his only choice was to flee—his shoes even fell off in the rush.

"Is it worth it to serve such a master?" Su Nantian asked.

"There's no 'worth' or 'not worth.' Even if it isn't, I have no choice. First, deal with you."

The guard roared desperately, draining his last strength.

Suddenly, the middle-aged guard's body turned red. His aura surged like a tiger's drug. Su Nantian felt pleased—this man still had potential.

Su Nantian observed the guard's rising aura and decided to take this seriously.

In an instant, the guard vanished from his spot, like an arrow shot from a bow, charging toward Su Nantian without looking back.

Su Nantian was surprised by the man's sudden power. It seemed like a secret technique to unleash his blood and qi, but it would likely damage his body. Such a powerful method could only be used once.

Su Nantian prepared himself, determined to use this opportunity to test and awaken his memories.

When the guard appeared before him, his fist was red-hot, radiating heat. Su Nantian still chose to defend rather than attack.

The fist struck his chest, burning through his clothes. It left only a punch mark on his body without breaking any ribs.

Su Nantian felt his internal organs tremble. This impact was immense; if he hadn't prepared, he might have been injured.

The second and third punches followed. By the fourth, Su Nantian felt his lungs strained—this punch had wounded him.

It was a hidden force. As he prepared to retaliate, his body felt an unexpected surge of energy—his injuries had healed completely.

To better understand this phenomenon, Su Nantian decided to stop resisting entirely. He let the guard strike him repeatedly without resistance.

He felt no retaliation but carefully observed his body's subtle changes. After each strike, he sensed a strange energy flowing through him.

Chapter 941: A Threshold

*Thud. Thud. Thud.*

Countless punches landed on Su Nantian's chest. The middle-aged guard was exhausted, his body trembling from the relentless blows. Yet this man remained unscathed, not even a drop of blood.

He felt each punch like hitting a mountain. No matter how much strength or speed he used, it couldn't break through.

He thought this man was a monster—unkillable.

After 200 punches, the guard heard a *crack*. Before he could react, his right arm snapped. He had overexerted himself.

This was the last straw. His strength vanished, and he collapsed to the ground, staring blankly at the sky.

He didn't know that Su Nantian had retreated over 100 zhang, leaving deep marks on the ground. Each punch's force was immense.

It wasn't that he was weak, but Su Nantian was far stronger. They were on different levels.

Su Nantian looked at the fallen guard and sighed, disappointment in his voice. "I have a few questions for you. Answer truthfully, and I won't kill you."

The guard was stunned by Su Nantian's words and disappointment. If not for the last statement, he might have committed suicide.

The guard took a deep breath and stood up. "What do you want to know?"

"Do you know of the Demon Sect?"

Su Nantian's first question left the guard bewildered. What was the Demon Sect? A new sect?

This mysterious and powerful person asking about it might be due to his low rank, not having encountered it.

After careful consideration, the guard shook his head. "Master, I've never heard of the Demon Sect. Perhaps my rank is too low to know."

Su Nantian frowned, hoping to learn the sect's location. But this man knew nothing.

He pulled out A Dai's map and handed it to the guard, who received it as if holding a treasure.

The guard opened the paper and immediately felt confused. Had the master given him the wrong map? It looked like a child's drawing—too simple, but it had everything. He carefully examined it.

"This location is Black Wind Fang. It's a place where cruel and ruthless people gather. Though their strength isn't great, they know the terrain well—hard to fight. There's also a mysterious figure behind them."

"Good, you know this place. I won't be aimless anymore," Su Nantian said with a smile. At least this man provided some useful information.

"Tell me more about it."

"The mysterious organization is suspected to be connected with one of the Four Imperial Clans, the Longevity Sect. Rumors say Black Wind Fang was searching for a sacred object but never found it."

The guard quickly shared all he knew, hiding nothing.

Su Nantian didn't care about what Black Wind Fang was searching for. They had taken Xiao Wang; if he died, they would be reduced to ashes.

But hearing about the mysterious master in Black Wind Fang made Su Nantian curious. He longed for a challenge, feeling this guard's punches had helped him understand his body better.

"Do you know of a shortcut to get there?"

Su Nantian thought about the two mountains he needed to cross. If he continued this way, Xiao Wang might already be tortured beyond recognition.

Moreover, Black Wind Fang taking Xiao Wang was definitely not good. The sooner he arrived, the better—ideally intercepting them mid-journey.

Going alone to Black Wind Fang would also eliminate his worries and hesitation.

"The shortcut exists, but it's too dangerous. You might fall into a deep ravine," the guard warned. This path was usually taken by Grand Elders, but for people like him who couldn't walk on air, it was a death trap.

He feared that if he led this master down the path and then the master blamed him, it would be a problem. He had a way out but chose to block it.

This was self-destruction!

"Any shortcut is fine. Lead me there, and I'll release you," Su Nantian said calmly.

"Master, I don't mind you taking that path. It's too dangerous. Even Grand Elders wouldn't take it unless they had urgent business. Though it saves time, the dangers are immense."

The guard repeated his warnings, fearing that if he reached the destination and this master blamed him, it would be a problem. He had no choice but to guide him.

"Leave that to me. If someone can cross it, I can too," Su Nantian said calmly.

But this statement shocked the guard. His eyes widened in disbelief, staring at Su Nantian. How could such a young man rival the Grand Elder? It was impossible.

He couldn't believe that even with years of cultivation, one could achieve this. There were rumors in their circle about a curse—no one could become Grand Elder before 40. Many young talents in their 30s had tried to cross this threshold but all perished, with varied and strange deaths. None survived.

This threshold was like a knife in front of them. No one dared to cross it without readiness, as failure meant death with high risk. Gradually, no one attempted it.

But this young man was clearly under 30! He wanted to take that path. If he succeeded, it would break the rule!

People were so eager to become Grand Elders before 40 because a great sage had prophesied that if someone succeeded, they would lead them into a new era. They would be their guide.

She left three items for this person to open the stone chamber. Though no one had seen this guide, the stone chamber was desired by many but failed to open—each attempt ended in blood and lessons.

Could the great sage's prophecy be broken? Even a master had died shortly after uttering this prophecy.

Though it was said he was in seclusion, the time since his seclusion had passed nearly a century. Those who knew guessed the truth—perhaps he had glimpsed fate and was punished by it, dying before reaching the Dao.

If this young man could cross that path, he would definitely become Grand Elder. Perhaps even open the stone chamber and retrieve those three items, leading them into a new era.

The guard looked at Su Nantian with reverence and admiration.

"Is there something wrong with this path?" Su Nantian asked coldly, noticing the guard's strange expression.

"Nothing is wrong. It's just too dangerous," the guard replied, but he didn't reveal his thoughts. Even he found this idea absurd—this man could never cross it.

"Dangerous? If a path is called dangerous, then nothing in this world is worth cherishing," Su Nantian said confidently.

The guard was speechless, stunned by the young man's boldness. Such a statement from one so young was truly remarkable.

Though he didn't know how this man managed to face such challenges or what his secret was, he only needed to watch. Whether it succeeded would be clear once Su Nantian took his first step.

"Good, well said. I'll lead you there," the guard stammered as he stood up, feeling his arm's pain. The memory of that moment still haunted him—leaving an indelible mark on his soul, likely preventing any future progress in cultivation.

At this age, advancement was unlikely. Just keeping his cultivation from declining was a blessing; further progress was a dream.

Meanwhile, A Dai had awakened. He felt his injuries were no longer severe and looked at Su Nantian with gratitude. "Master, thank you for saving me."

He knew it was the master who had intervened; he wouldn't have survived. The youth would surely kill him.

"This is what you deserve. Cultivate well," Su Nantian said with a smile. A Dai called him master, and he had already accepted it. This boy's talent was exceptional—enough to be his disciple. Yet, they would eventually part ways, which was why he disliked taking disciples.

The three of them walked toward the shortcut. After about half a day, they reached their destination.

When A Dai saw the treacherous path clinging to the cliff wall, he was speechless. Was this a path for humans?

"Master, let's climb the mountain instead. This path is too dangerous. I'm worried about you..." A Dai said, concern in his voice.

But seeing Su Nantian's calm face, his worries eased. His master always created miracles; this time would be no different.

He chose to fully trust Su Nantian.

The middle-aged guard, seeing no signs of retreat from Su Nantian, felt his heart ease slightly. He had always feared that if the master was blamed, he would be thrown down.

Though he had resolved to die before, hope was now within reach. No one would choose death in the face of hope, no matter how slim.

"Stay here and get some food. I'll go into the forest to find something," Su Nantian said, then vanished like a ghost.

The guard watched this and felt a chill. This method was too mysterious. Each time the young man revealed his strength, he felt shocked and confused.

How could someone so young be this strong? Perhaps he was from one of the Four Imperial Clans, as only they could make these twelve tribes fear.

Their young talents might be the only ones who could match this man. Thinking back to what had happened, his heart was on edge.

He should have respected this young man more. He had hit him hundreds of times, and though the young man was unharmed, his hand had broken. This wasn't a reason to let him go.

"You come with me and catch some food," A Dai said, watching the man carefully. His master had left, so he needed to keep an eye on him—otherwise, if the man escaped and his master was blamed, it would be a disaster.

A Dai threw him a rope. "Tie it around your waist."

The guard was stunned but quickly understood—A Dai feared he would run. He smiled and didn't refuse, tying the rope around his waist. A Dai held the other end tightly to prevent him from fleeing.

Soon, A Dai caught three wild animals and led the guard back to where they had left. Su Nantian hadn't returned yet.

They built a fire and roasted meat, the aroma spreading quickly. The guard was starving but A Dai insisted on waiting for Su Nantian to return before eating.

Meanwhile, Su Nantian moved through the forest, observing carefully. He collected vines wherever he found suitable ones, quickly gathering a large pile.

After returning to the starting point with his bundle of vines, he saw the roasted meat had turned black. He smiled. "The meat is burnt—why don't you eat it?"

He grabbed a skewer and took a big bite, showing no concern for his appearance.

The three of them began to eat.

A Dai looked at the bundle of vines Su Nantian had brought. "Master, why did you bring so many vines? Do you have a plan to cross this dangerous path?"

A Dai was puzzled by the bundle.

"You'll know soon," Su Nantian said.

Chapter 943: A Miracle

Soon, the three of them finished their meal.

Su Nantian looked at the pile of vines and said, "Help me cut each vine into five-meter lengths, then divide each into three strands."

As soon as Su Nantian spoke, A Dai immediately started working. The three of them worked enthusiastically.

After about a quarter of an hour, Su Nantian looked at the neatly arranged vines—each five meters long and divided into three strands. He took five of them, twisted them together like a braid, and looked around.

He noticed the middle-aged guard's sword at his waist. "Lend me your sword, I won't return it."

The guard immediately took off his sword and handed it to Su Nantian with both hands.

Su Nantian pulled the sword from its sheath. It was flexible and elastic, clearly a fine blade. Each inch was made of gold and iron, obviously valuable.

He took the sword in his hand and raised one hand to strike it.

*Swish! Swish! Swish!*

Three strikes, and the two-foot-long sword was split into three pieces.

The guard and A Dai stared in shock. What was this? To strike a sword with his bare hands—unthinkable. The guard was especially shocked; how could this blade, which cut through iron like butter, be split into three pieces with bare hands?

This exceeded his understanding. Even the Grand Elder couldn't do this. How could this young man achieve it?

Both were stunned.

Su Nantian picked up two pieces of the blade and tied them to one end of the rope, securing it firmly.

"Alright, we can depart now," Su Nantian said calmly.

The middle-aged guard stared at the tool, confused about its purpose. Could it help them cross this cliff? Would they pass safely?

That was impossible.

A Dai didn't ask further, simply took two thick ropes as instructed.

Su Nantian examined the simple sketch again. After crossing this dangerous section, they were much closer to Black Wind Fang—only about a hundred kilometers away. Though the path was perilous, it wasn't impossible.

Su Nantian put the map away and turned to the middle-aged guard. "After we leave, you can go."

The guard was stunned. He hadn't expected this young man to let him leave. He couldn't help but ask, "You don't fear I'm lying—that it's a dead end?"

Su Nantian smiled but said nothing. To the common person, this path was a dead end. But to him, it wasn't impossible. He had absolute confidence that this man hadn't lied.
