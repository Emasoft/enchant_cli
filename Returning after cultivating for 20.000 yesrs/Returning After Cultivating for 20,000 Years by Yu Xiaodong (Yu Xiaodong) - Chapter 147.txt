“Hmph, my nephew is truly considerate. You come to visit me so often these days.”

At this moment, Wu Chuan withdrew his expressionless gaze and ceased scrutinizing Nan Gong Ping. After a pause, he spoke again with an air of deliberate subtlety.

Though the words seemed innocuous, each syllable carried a probing intent, revealing Wu Chuan’s current bewilderment.

He quickly redirected his gaze and let it slowly drift toward Su Nantian.

Su Nantian understood that Wu Chuan was no pushover like Li’s assistant, so he slowly shook his head at Wu Chuan, indicating that he too was unaware of Nan Gong Ping’s intentions.

After responding with a gesture, Su Nantian returned to his usual posture—eyes gazing at the nose, mind focused inward—as if he knew nothing.

Seeing that Wu Chuan had gleaned no useful information from him and that Su Nantian truly seemed ignorant of the situation, Wu Chuan withdrew his gaze.

Then he turned back to Nan Gong Ping: “Is your father’s health improved? The recent family head assembly saw him attend only a few times. Frankly, I’ve been quite concerned about his well-being.”

“Thank you for your concern, Master. My father is in good health; it’s merely his age that causes some stiffness.”

Nan Gong Ping clearly discerned Wu Chuan’s probing intent behind the question. Moreover, he had heard whispers suggesting that Nan Gong Lin’s urgency in selecting a worthy heir stemmed from his deteriorating health.

Nan Gong Ping had always dismissed these rumors as baseless, yet people naturally favored the strong and scorned the weak. Especially within the major families of the inland port, outward calmness masked undercurrents of strife.

Thus, Nan Gong Ping maintained his composure and deftly replied to Wu Chuan’s inquiries. He emphasized that Nan Gong Lin was in excellent health, urging Wu Chuan not to speculate unnecessarily.

“Hmph, that’s reassuring.”

Wu Chuan remained uncertain whether he truly believed Nan Gong Ping or merely nodded along. He tactfully refrained from pressing further.

Moreover, after addressing this matter, Wu Chuan added: “Still, your father was fortunate to have such a pair of outstanding children. After devoting his life to labor, it’s time he took some rest. I, alas, lack such fortune.”

As Wu Chuan spoke, he let out another chuckle. Whether it was genuine or feigned remained known only to himself.

“Master’s praise is too kind. You also have Miss Wu You’er to share your burdens, so why envy others?”

Nan Gong Ping returned a smile and subtly invoked Wu You’er’s name.

Upon hearing Wu You’er’s name, Wu Chuan’s pupils constricted sharply, a fleeting emotion flashing across her eyes. Yet the speed was too swift for Su Nantian to catch, leaving him puzzled about Wu Chuan’s true state.

But one thing was certain: Wu Chuan’s shift stemmed from the mention of Wu You’er.

Realizing this, Su Nantian’s gaze darkened, his emotions growing complex.

“Hmph, we are old now. The prosperity of the inland port will depend on your generation to forge ahead.”

Wu Chuan swiftly masked his emotions and shifted topics: “Forgive me for rambling; I haven’t yet asked why my nephew has come specifically today.”

At this point, Wu Chuan did not grant Nan Gong Ping a chance to reply but continued immediately: “No matter what the issue is, you may speak freely. If I can resolve it, I shall.”

“That single sentence from Master is enough,” Nan Gong Ping replied. He was no fool; though his talent paled compared to his sister Nan Gong Yuyan, he still surpassed ordinary men.

Moreover, during this period, Nan Gong Lin had deliberately trained him, accompanying him to numerous banquets and introducing him to many influential figures of the inland port.

Thus, Nan Gong Ping had grown less naive and more adept in his strategies.

It was precisely this maturity that allowed him to easily discern Wu Chuan’s words as mere politeness, not genuine assistance.

Therefore, Nan Gong Ping offered a polite reply without pressing Wu Chuan further or foolishly raising an issue.

After a pause, Nan Gong Ping finally revealed the purpose of his visit: “I merely thought that with two days until the wetland bidding, it was no time to be careless. I came to consult Master about this matter.”

Having exchanged several conversations with Wu Chuan before, Nan Gong Ping now handled the situation with ease, no longer flustered: “This collaboration is mutually beneficial, but we must remain vigilant against those with ulterior motives. We cannot let others exploit gaps.”

Nan Gong Ping smiled as he conveyed his purpose to Wu Chuan, while simultaneously probing Wu Chuan’s recent activities, hoping to uncover any leverage.

Yet Wu Chuan was no novice; he was a seasoned fox. Thus, Nan Gong Ping’s subtle tactics were utterly beneath his notice.

Hence, Wu Chuan merely smiled without answering directly, deflecting with vague words: “My nephew speaks truthfully; indeed, many families eye us两家 closely. We must remain cautious.”

After uttering this, Wu Chuan turned the question back to Nan Gong Ping: “My nephew has come so many times; surely you have a well-considered plan? Please share it, and we can analyze it thoroughly to ensure this collaboration proceeds smoothly.”

Wu Chuan’s words were clearly probing Nan Gong Family’s strategies. Though Nan Gong Ping was still green compared to Wu Chuan, he was no fool and understood that Wu Chuan was probing his secrets.

“I merely had questions, so I sought Master’s insight.”

Thus, Nan Gong Ping mirrored Wu Chuan’s tactic of evasiveness. Neither gained an advantage over the other.

Chapter 736: Mentioning

Realizing neither could glean useful information from the other, they quickly shifted topics and ceased discussing it further.

Yet Wu Chuan persisted in questioning Nan Gong Ping about internal matters of the Nan Gong Family, attempting to deduce their secrets.

Though Nan Gong Ping wished to feign ignorance, he inadvertently let slip some words under Wu Chuan’s probing. Given Wu Chuan’s depth of cunning, piecing together fragments was enough to infer the general situation.

In this regard, Nan Gong Ping was utterly outmatched.

Su Nantian stood by silently, eyes gazing at his nose, mind focused inward, feigning ignorance. Yet he had not missed a single word of their sharp exchanges.

At this moment, Su Nantian inwardly chuckled, thinking Nan Gong Ping was still several levels beneath Wu Chuan.

No wonder he had been led by the nose all along.

But this was not his primary purpose for coming today, so Su Nantian did not reveal his thoughts. Instead, he feigned ignorance and diligently played the role of a bodyguard.

After discussing further matters, Wu Chuan and Nan Gong Ping eventually shifted to trivial topics.

At this moment, Nan Gong Ping cast a meaningful glance at Su Nantian before withdrawing his gaze and turning to Wu Chuan: “Master, you’ve visited so many times without meeting Miss Wu You’er. Our previous conversation made me feel our interests aligned perfectly. I’ve come again specifically to meet Miss Wu You’er.”

“Why haven’t I seen Miss Wu You’er yet?”

After uttering this, Nan Gong Ping again cast a meaningful glance at Su Nantian, as if implying, “I’m giving you an opportunity.”

Su Nantian continued to gaze at his nose and focus inward, ignoring Nan Gong Ping entirely.

After all, in front of Wu Chuan, any small gesture was transparent; he dared not take the risk.

Nan Gong Ping received no response from Su Nantian, nor did he display embarrassment or anger. Instead, he inwardly chuckled, thinking Su Nantian was merely shy and feigning propriety.

His mood improved, unaware that Wu Chuan’s expression had changed upon hearing the mention of Wu You’er.

Though Wu Chuan tried to conceal it, his abruptly tightened palm revealed his impatience toward Wu You’er.

Moreover, the more he reacted, the clearer it was that Wu You’er’s situation was dire. Otherwise, Wu Chuan would have summoned her to converse directly with Nan Gong Ping.

“Hmph, it’s kind of you to remember Wu You’er.”

Wu Chuan spoke with a calm smile before adding: “But Wu You’er has been unwell recently and needs rest. She’s not fit to go out in the wind.”

Wu Chuan spoke, yet his gaze remained fixed on Nan Gong Ping. He had not expected Nan Gong Ping to suddenly mention Wu You’er.

Previously, Wu Chuan had intended to pair Nan Gong Ping with Wu You’er to more easily control the Nan Gong Family.

But after discovering Wu You’er’s disobedience and her subsequent disturbances, Wu Chuan had entirely abandoned this plan.

Now, Wu Chuan was even concerned that if Wu You’er grew too close to Nan Gong Ping, it would interfere with his plans.

Thus, upon hearing Nan Gong Ping mention Wu You’er, he immediately became tense and scrutinized Nan Gong Ping: “Next time when Wu You’er recovers, she will personally visit your Nan Gong Family. I apologize sincerely.”

Wu Chuan withdrew his gaze and smiled politely to apologize.

His demeanor was amiable, seemingly genuine at first glance. Yet only Su Nantian understood the truth: Wu Chuan must have done something to Wu You’er, or he had decided to discard her entirely, hence refusing to let anyone meet her.

The more Su Nantian thought about it, the heavier his heart grew, and the more he worried about Wu You’er’s condition.

Yet无奈, Wu Chuan had offered an excuse, and even if Nan Gong Ping had other reasons, it was hard to openly suspect Wu Chuan.

Thus, Nan Gong Ping, though disappointed, smiled gracefully: “That’s indeed inconvenient.”

After saying this, Nan Gong Ping continued: “But since Miss Wu You’er is unwell, let her rest well. As for visiting your family, it’s not that serious. Master, please don’t do so.”

Nan Gong Ping knew women were delicate and was unaware of Wu Chuan and Wu You’er’s hidden dealings, so he could not fathom other possibilities.

Thus, he naturally accepted this explanation and thought Su Nantian was simply unlucky for not meeting the beloved woman.

“My nephew’s understanding is truly commendable.”

Seeing that Nan Gong Ping had not insisted on meeting Wu You’er, Wu Chuan secretly exhaled a breath of relief.

His clenched fist slowly loosened.

He had originally thought Nan Gong Ping knew something and was testing him. Thus, he planned to fabricate a convincing excuse if Nan Gong Ping continued pressing.

But he had not even begun searching for an excuse when Nan Gong Ping himself abandoned the idea.

Still, it was better this way; it spared him much trouble and eliminated the need to fabricate further excuses for Nan Gong Ping.

Nan Gong Ping continued chatting with Wu Chuan, discussing trivial matters until they were satisfied. Then Wu Chuan warmly invited Nan Gong Ping to stay for dinner.

Since he had already visited, spending an hour for a meal was no issue.

Thus, Nan Gong Ping immediately accepted without hesitation, smiling and thanking Wu Chuan: “Master is too kind. Since you’ve extended such a generous invitation, as a junior, I cannot refuse. I shall thus comply with your courtesy.”

Nan Gong Ping smiled again and elevated Wu Chuan’s status.

In truth, Nan Gong Ping was deeply dissatisfied with his visit today, which had yielded no useful information. He felt disheartened and thought he had wasted his time and effort.

Wu Chuan, however, did not care about Nan Gong Ping’s inner resentment; as long as the Wu Family’s secrets were not uncovered, he felt at ease.

“My nephew’s favor is truly appreciated.”

Chapter 737: Malicious Intent

Wu Chuan smiled again at Nan Gong Ping, and the exchange felt harmonious.

Though Su Nantian was currently favored and trusted by the Nan Gong Family, in the end, his identity remained merely a bodyguard before Wu Chuan.

Thus, according to convention, he could not dine with Wu Chuan and the others.

Wu Chuan had Li’s assistant lead Su Nantian down to eat, not showing him any neglect.

This arrangement also gave Li’s assistant the chance to question Su Nantian.

Indeed, as soon as they left the dining room for guests, Li’s assistant immediately pressed Su Nantian: “What’s going on with Nan Gong Ping? Why did he suddenly come to the Wu Family without prior notice?”

Li’s assistant directly questioned Su Nantian, his gaze sharp and demanding a convincing explanation.

At this moment, Su Nantian quickly suppressed all his emotions and feigned ignorance, gazing blankly at Li’s assistant: “Though I’ve recently gained Nan Gong Ping’s favor, since my time in the Nan Gong Family is short, he still keeps some distance from me and hasn’t fully trusted me.”

Su Nantian explained, offering an example: “Like today’s sudden visit to the Wu Family—this was his spontaneous idea. He hadn’t discussed it with me beforehand. And when he said he would come, he arrived immediately; I had no chance to inform you.”

Su Nantian answered Li’s assistant seriously, his words sincere and devoid of falsehood.

Li’s assistant listened to Su Nantian’s explanation, then glanced at him doubtfully: “Are you telling the truth?”

As he asked, Li’s assistant scrutinized Su Nantian.

“Of course it is. How dare I lie to you? Moreover, since I’ve accepted your conditions, we are on the same side. How could I not help you?”

Su Nantian reasoned with Li’s assistant, appealing to both emotion and logic: “Even for the sake of money, I wouldn’t dare have other thoughts.”

Su Nantian knew he and Li’s assistant were collaborating half-heartedly.

Moreover, given Li’s assistant’s suspicious nature, if he appeared to desire nothing and feigned loyalty, it would only raise suspicion.

Thus, Su Nantian carefully balanced his approach, revealing a weakness to make it more plausible and believable.

“Indeed, I wouldn’t dare deceive you.”

Li’s assistant listened to Su Nantian’s explanation and first scrutinized him before speaking: “But remember, the Master never tolerates useless waste. Since you’ve already cooperated with us, we’ve given you a long time. If you don’t show some initiative and keep skulking, the Master won’t tolerate you!”

Li’s assistant warned Su Nantian, his gaze filled with threats: “You’d better remember this and pass on useful clues as soon as possible.”

Li’s assistant continued to pressure Su Nantian.

“Li Assistant, rest assured I’m already diligently probing for information. I believe useful evidence will soon be found.”

Su Nantian immediately replied to Li’s assistant, earnestly vowing to fulfill his duties and pass on the clues promptly.

Li’s assistant felt relieved seeing Su Nantian no longer contradicted him but instead showed respect, thinking Su Nantian looked more likable than before.

Li’s assistant nodded and continued: “That’s natural. Remember, your actions must be swift. All movements need to be cautious and avoid raising suspicion. If something goes wrong, you’ll have no one to blame but yourself!”

Li’s assistant, perhaps in a better mood, gave Su Nantian a warning after scolding him.

Yet Li’s assistant left one sentence unspoken: if Su Nantian truly caused trouble, Wu Chuan would certainly eradicate the problem completely and let no one trace back to them.

Of course, Li’s assistant would never tell Su Nantian this; he didn’t want to scare him and provoke thoughts against the Wu Family.

“Talking to you has taken so long.”

Li’s assistant then glanced at his watch, muttered “Oops,” and looked up at Su Nantian: “Remember this! Do you understand?”

“Yes, Li Assistant. I will remember it and never forget.”

Su Nantian immediately replied to Li’s assistant, seeing the urgency in his eyes and asking: “But Li Assistant, what’s wrong? You seem so urgent, as if something big has happened.”

Su Nantian spoke while using a gentle tone to entice Li’s assistant to reveal the truth.

“What else? It’s delivering food to that little master!”

At this moment, Li’s assistant, preoccupied with other matters and in a hurry, didn’t think twice before blurting out the words.

Upon realizing his slip, Li’s assistant immediately turned fierce and glared at Su Nantian: “Why are you asking? What does it have to do with you?”

Li’s assistant scolded Su Nantian sharply.

“I’m just concerned about something big and care about you, Li Assistant.”

Su Nantian softened his tone and offered an explanation.

“Enough! Don’t bother with other matters. Just continue to probe, and don’t come to the Wu Family often; it might draw attention.”

Li’s assistant, now agitated, waved Su Nantian off and warned: “By the way, what I said earlier must stay in your stomach. Don’t let it out! Otherwise, no one can save you!”

“Yes, thank you for the reminder, Li Assistant. I’ve remembered it.”

Su Nantian again apologized and nodded in understanding.

In truth, Su Nantian’s mind was already churning.

Delivering food?

Su Nantian suddenly pondered the two words Li’s assistant had said. His instinct immediately thought of Wu You’er.

But in this situation, he couldn’t ask too many questions; otherwise, it would only raise Li’s assistant’s suspicion and result in failure.

“Alright, you’re wise! I won’t talk more!”

Li’s assistant glanced at his watch again, pretending to be in a hurry. He gave Su Nantian another warning before briskly leaving without looking back.

Su Nantian watched his hurried figure and gradually formed an idea, beginning to ponder carefully.

Su Nantian felt that there was an 80% chance Li’s assistant had gone to deliver food to Wu You’er.

But the problem was, this was Wu Family territory and daytime; how could he secretly follow Li’s assistant without being noticed?

Moreover, Su Nantian had a strong intuition that if he followed him secretly, he would find Wu You’er.

But now there were many guards eating together; it was too crowded for Su Nantian to act recklessly. He could only take a deep breath, suppress his urgency repeatedly, and carefully hide it.

He couldn’t rush; he had to wait for the right opportunity.

At this moment, when Su Nantian was in a dilemma, one of the guards rushed in from the door, as if encountering an emergency. He hurriedly told everyone: “Quick! Everyone stop eating. There’s something in the east; let’s go check it out!”

As soon as the guard spoke, the others dropped their chopsticks and rushed to go east without even wiping their mouths.

In an instant, the previously lively dining hall was left with only Su Nantian. The Wu Family’s security personnel and guards had all left, rushing out quickly to avoid missing anything important.

Su Nantian watched their hurried departure and felt a surge of hope, thinking the opportunity had arrived.

It seemed his luck was still decent; he had just dozed off when someone brought him a pillow!

Thinking this, Su Nantian was even more reluctant to waste time. He quickly surveyed the surroundings and, upon finding no one guarding, immediately followed Li’s assistant’s direction carefully.

Whether he could successfully find Wu You’er depended entirely on his luck today!

At this moment, Su Nantian was only thinking of rescuing Wu You’er and freeing her from suffering.

He had no idea that this was actually a small test Wu Chuan had set for him.

The place he longed for had already been a trap waiting to be sprung.

But even if Su Nantian knew about this trap, as long as he thought Wu You’er was there and that her condition was bad, he would still risk everything to save her without hesitation.

Thus, no matter whether Su Nantian knew about this or not, if there was any chance of finding Wu You’er, he would never hesitate.

On the other hand, Li’s assistant had already hurriedly taken the food basket to a safe house.

He furrowed his brow and strode quickly, exchanging a greeting with the security personnel at the door before entering.

He didn’t close the door but left someone to guard them constantly.

“Wu You’er, it’s time to eat.”

Li’s assistant slapped the basket onto the table and spoke with disdain.

If it weren’t for worrying about other people delivering food and causing trouble, Li’s assistant wouldn’t have endured this daily burden of running back and forth.

Moreover, he had to endure Wu You’er’s ghostly face every time.

Li’s assistant spoke harshly and gave the two security personnel a glance, signaling them to help Wu You’er up.

“I won’t eat!”

To avoid any incidents, even during meals, they only removed the tape from Wu You’er’s mouth. Her hands and feet remained tightly bound.

As soon as Wu You’er’s mouth was free, she immediately shouted: “You bastards! I won’t eat!”

Because she hadn’t drunk water for a long time and was so desperate to curse, her voice was hoarse. She spoke in a growl, as if sandpaper rubbing against gravel, producing an extremely sharp and unpleasant sound.

“Hmph! You have no choice!”

Li’s assistant was accustomed to Wu You’er’s outbursts every day. He spoke with a cold smile and said to the security personnel: “You, feed her.”

“Yes, Li Assistant.”

The security personnel dared not refuse Li’s assistant’s command. They immediately replied and quickly took the chopsticks to feed Wu You’er.

“Ugh! I won’t eat!”

How could Wu You’er easily submit? She clenched her teeth and kept turning her head to avoid the food.

In the end, because of her evasion, the food fell on her clothes, and Wu You’er hadn’t eaten a single bite.

“Li Assistant, this…”

The security personnel nervously bit their lips, looking at Li’s assistant but having no solution. She wouldn’t open her mouth, so they couldn’t force it open.

“Never mind, you two step aside. Let me do it.”

Li’s assistant frowned. He knew these brutes were still wary of Wu You’er’s status and hesitated to act too harshly.

But Li’s assistant had been by Wu Chuan’s side for a long time and understood the situation clearly.

Moreover, Wu Chuan had explicitly said that as long as Wu You’er remained alive, other issues were irrelevant.

“Hmph! Wu You’er, you know my nature. Don’t expect me to pity you.”

After this realization, Li’s assistant let out a cold laugh and didn’t wait for Wu You’er to react. He immediately grabbed her cheeks forcefully, forcing her mouth open.

Then he shoved the food into Wu You’er’s mouth without giving her any face.

Chapter 739: Bullying

“Swallow it! Don’t make me repeat myself!”

His actions were crude and showed no mercy. Wu You’er’s teeth ached from the spoon, and her lips even had a small wound.

“Ugh…”

Wu You’er let out a groan. Even so, she stubbornly kept her mouth closed and clenched her teeth, refusing to yield or comply with Li’s assistant.

Moreover, she glared at Li’s assistant with hatred and refused to show weakness in front of him.

“Stupid girl! Do you still think you hold your old status?”

Li’s assistant hadn’t expected Wu You’er to continue defying him. His face darkened, partly because she had added to his workload and partly because she had embarrassed him in front of the security personnel.

“Wu You’er!”

Li’s assistant gritted his teeth and spoke, his actions becoming even more brutal. Wu You’er’s lip wound widened under his force, and blood trickled down, making her look pitiful.

“You’d better cooperate; otherwise, it’ll be you who suffers!”

Li’s assistant laughed coldly and threatened again: “If you keep moving around, I’ll have these security personnel clean your body!”

It was always the maids who took care of Wu You’er. If security personnel did it, that would be a great humiliation.

Upon hearing Li’s assistant’s threat, Wu You’er’s face turned pale. She bit her lip again.

“How about it? Have you decided, to eat obediently or let them clean your body?”

Li’s assistant saw Wu You’er’s change in expression and noticed the hatred in her eyes. He felt even more enjoyment, letting out a sneer and continuing to threaten: “You’d better be sensible; don’t cause trouble.”

Wu You’er still defiantly glared at Li’s assistant, but when she heard the humiliating words, tears suddenly flowed uncontrollably.

The security personnel, hearing Li’s assistant’s threat and seeing Wu You’er’s pitiful state, felt immense pity. They all averted their eyes, unwilling to watch Wu You’er cry.

But Li’s assistant didn’t feel the least bit sympathetic; instead, he felt immense satisfaction: “Hmph! Cry? Do you think tears are useful? I’ll give you one last chance. I count to three; if you don’t open your mouth, don’t blame me.”

Li’s assistant took the chopsticks and looked at Wu You’er, beginning to count: “Three… two…”

Wu You’er had wanted to continue resisting, but she couldn’t. The moment she thought about being taken by the security personnel for cleaning, that humiliation was unbearable. Thus, in the end, Wu You’er yielded to Li’s assistant and slowly closed her eyes, resignedly opening her mouth.

“Hahahaha! I’ll teach you to be stubborn! Keep being stubborn!”

Li’s assistant, seeing Wu You’er finally yield under his control, felt immense satisfaction. He let out a cold laugh and gazed at Wu You’er with even more arrogance: “I’ll see how long you can keep defying me!”

He had already insulted Wu You’er, yet it wasn’t enough. He continued to mock and laugh at her. When Li’s assistant finished mocking, he directly handed the chopsticks to another security personnel:

“Alright, you handle the rest. Make sure she eats it all; not a single grain must be left. If she acts up or plays tricks, you don’t hesitate to inform me.”

Li’s assistant instructed the security personnel and cast a haughty glance at Wu You’er: “Remember, obeying is your fate!”

After saying this, Li’s assistant laughed arrogantly and strode away without another glance at Wu You’er.

“Li Mu…”

Wu You’er spoke with a hoarse voice, watching Li’s assistant’s back and slowly speaking. Her eyes were filled with hatred.

“Miss Wu You’er, you should eat quickly. Cooperating makes it easier for everyone.”

The security personnel, feeling some pity, softened their tone and continued feeding Wu You’er.

Wu You’er knew that continuing to resist would only burden the security personnel and herself. If Li’s assistant found out, she would be the one suffering.

Moreover, this wouldn’t benefit her at all.

After thinking through these points, Wu You’er didn’t continue to be stubborn but cooperated with the security personnel, eating one bite at a time.

Wu You’er knew that what she needed to do now was preserve her strength. She had to wait for Su Nantian to rescue her and reunite with her parents. She absolutely couldn’t cause more trouble in this matter.

Wu You’er’s eyes became even more determined because of her thoughts.

She would never submit to Wu Chuan or Li’s assistant.

One day, she would make them regret what they had done to her and crush them under her feet.

Meanwhile, Wu You’er was suffering here, while Su Nantian was searching for her.

Because he had left after Li’s assistant had been gone for some time, it was somewhat difficult to find him. Moreover, the security personnel here had increased several times.

Su Nantian had to be careful with this issue while also dividing his attention, making it even more challenging.

Otherwise, if Su Nantian saw Wu You’er being insulted by Li’s assistant like this, he would never let Li’s assistant off the hook.

“Where is she?”

Su Nantian furrowed his brows and muttered quietly.

It was his slow movement that caused this delay; if he had come out earlier, he might have found Li’s assistant sooner and followed him to find Wu You’er.

But now that Li’s assistant had disappeared, no matter how regretful he was, he couldn’t find him.

“Is this going to fail again?”

Su Nantian furrowed his brows again and muttered quietly, his expression becoming even more grim.

Why was this mission so full of obstacles? Every time he was about to succeed, something happened, disrupting all his progress.

Thinking this, Su Nantian’s expression grew even grimmer.

But soon, Su Nantian spotted a familiar figure ahead.

It was Li’s assistant!

Su Nantian raised his eyebrows, rekindling hope.

He had known he shouldn’t have given up so easily!

Su Nantian carefully observed the direction Li’s assistant had come from.

After Li’s assistant left, Su Nantian quickly headed in the opposite direction.

Chapter 740: Found You

Su Nantian now had a strong intuition that he would soon find Wu You’er!

Once he found her, no matter what she said, he would immediately take her away. Once they reached a safe place, he would explain to Wu You’er about her parents.

Although this news would be hard for Wu You’er to accept, the immediate priority was to take her out of the Wu Family’s prison. Only then would it be the correct course of action.

After thinking this through, Su Nantian quickened his pace.

He planned to first confirm Wu You’er’s current condition and then take her out of the Wu Family.

He absolutely couldn’t let Wu You’er suffer again. This time, no matter what happened or what obstacles there were, he had to take Wu You’er away.
