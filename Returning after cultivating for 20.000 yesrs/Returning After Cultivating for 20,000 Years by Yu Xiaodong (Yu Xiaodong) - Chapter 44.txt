Zhang Xue's lips quivered with disdain as she pointed at Wang Dapan, declaring with righteous indignation: "Look at you! Beating someone like that—mental damage compensation is surely unavoidable."

Raising his gaze, Su Nantian spoke coldly: "Give it to him. If he asks for it, I'll give it."

Su Nantian's demeanor struck Wang Dapan like a thunderclap, leaving him trembling and waving his hands frantically: "No! I don't need it! I won't sue you!"

Su Nantian shrugged, shifting his gaze to Zhang Xue with an air of helplessness: "I intended to compensate, but look—he doesn't need it."

"Exactly," Feng Yue interjected, eager to escort Zhang Xue away. "The victim isn't pressing charges; we can't hold Su Nantian accountable. Besides, this incident wasn’t his fault. Stop causing trouble and come back with me."

As he spoke, Feng Yue reached to clasp Zhang Xue's shoulder. She frowned and shifted her shoulders subtly, slipping out of his grasp before darting to the patrol team members to harass Wang Dapan.

When Wang Dapan saw Zhang Xue approaching, he instinctively felt dread. Seeing her close in, he flinched and dodged.

Zhang Xue snapped: "What are you running from? I'm here to avenge you! Come out!"

Wang Dapan wasn't foolish. He'd already noticed Feng Yue was the team leader, and Feng Yue's deference to Su Nantian made it clear who held power. There was no need to mention the boisterous woman before him.

"I won't come out! Don’t pull me! I won’t sue!" Wang Dapan and Zhang Xue danced around the patrol team members, dodging and chasing each other.

"Enough!" Feng Yue barked, waving to his subordinates: "Take them away!"

The patrol team sighed in relief, grabbing the troublemakers and rushing downstairs. Zhang Xue couldn’t stop them, so she glared at Feng Yue, annoyed he’d ruined her plan.

Feng Yue quickly approached to calm Zhang Xue, whispering: "You’re not in the right here. Even if you dragged Su Nantian back, what would it achieve? Remember the school incident? Evidence was clear, yet Su Nantian still walked free."

"Now it's just a small restaurant case. Even if Su Nantian returned with us, the head would gladly send him back. Then we’d both get scolded—do you think that’s worth it?"

Zhang Xue's face immediately darkened with conflict. Feng Yue saw an opening and pressed: "I know you want to apprehend Su Nantian, but as long as the mountain remains, there's no need to burn the forest, right?"

After a pause, Zhang Xue’s fierce gaze dimmed. She reluctantly nodded, glared at Su Nantian, and then sauntered down the stairs.

Feng Yue exhaled heavily, smiling at Su Nantian: "My apologies. I’ll manage this properly."

Chapter 207: Admiration

After Feng Yue followed Zhang Xue downstairs, Song Jin adjusted his glasses and rushed to Su Nantian’s side, admiration lighting his face: "Senior Su Nantian, no—now I’ll call you 'Big Brother Tian'!"

"You truly astonished me!"

Su Nantian disliked flattery, so he didn’t directly respond. He merely offered a polite smile. That smile deepened his enigmatic aura.

Zhao Ling, drawn to Su Nantian by the patrol team’s arrival, asked: "Senior Su, do you know anyone from the patrol team?"

Zhao Ling was young; even if she said something wrong, it wouldn’t anger Su Nantian. Moreover, her question mirrored what everyone wanted to know.

Everyone held their breath, listening intently.

Su Nantian naturally noticed their curiosity and smiled: "We have some connection."

Their eyes brightened, and they clustered around Su Nantian, urging him to sit and filling his glass with water.

Someone asked: "Earlier, when you fought Shen Fei at school..." The sentence had just begun when Cao Yun shot a glare. Song Jin realized his mistake and laughed awkwardly: "They came to the patrol team, but I didn’t expect you to be so sensitive."

Su Nantian hadn’t dwelled on Shen Fei’s incident, so when Song Jin accidentally mentioned it, he simply smiled and let it pass. "The patrol team did come, but not by my request. It was Shen Fei’s father who called them to investigate."

Shen Fei's father? Then the patrol team was on Su Nantian’s side?

They paused, confused. Regardless of how they thought, they assumed it was due to Su Nantian’s extraordinary background.

Rumors about Su Nantian's family had spread, each version differing. But after his fight with Shen Fei, Su Nantian's strength had become an enigma at Fengyue University.

"Then, since it was Shen Fei’s father who called them, why did they show such restraint toward you?" Song Jin asked.

Su Nantian checked his phone, noting there was still half an hour until class. He patiently explained: "They didn’t show restraint; the case was justified, and it wasn’t my fault. That’s why they stopped investigating. What do you think? Was it my family background that intimidated them, or my strength that made them wary?"

The group chuckled awkwardly. Even Cao Yun stifled a laugh.

Su Nantian understood their unspoken thoughts and found it amusing. Though the patrol team had acted out of fear of Su Nantian’s strength and the Gao and Lin families’ influence, he didn’t want to openly admit it.

That would not be a proud act for the patrol team and might erode public trust.

Whether anyone grasped Su Nantian’s true meaning remained unclear, but they stopped questioning the patrol team. However, Zhao Ling asked: "But Senior Su, that female patrol officer was so harsh with you. She kept trying to drag you back."

Zhao Ling’s gossip turned the room into a gossipy atmosphere. Su Nantian's lips twitched, and he said patiently: "She had some misunderstandings earlier. You didn’t know, so this happened." He paused and added: "Actually, she’s quite nice. Very interesting."

Su Nantian's interested expression planted seeds of unease in Cao Yun and Zhao Ling. Cao Yun even masked her smile.

"Does that mean Senior Su likes her?" Zhao Ling, now deeply interested in Su Nantian’s personal life, asked.

Zhao Ling remembered that Su Nantian had met her while supposedly buying underwear for his girlfriend.

After pondering, Su Nantian said: "Everyone likes beautiful things; it doesn’t interfere."

Zhao Ling bit her lip, pouting. Cao Yun’s pretty face also showed tension as she agreed with Su Nantian's statement, leaving only the male members of the group.

"Big Brother Tian’s words are right. After all, life is about appreciating beautiful things," said Gao Zhiyi.

But such words grated on those with ears attuned to subtleties. Cao Yun’s expression darkened, and she checked her phone, fabricating an excuse: "We should return to school. You have a match this afternoon; it’s better to arrive early."

Su Nantian considered it and agreed. He had no major issues, always prepared. But these clueless males were another story.

Thinking this through, Su Nantian said: "Let’s go back and see what we need to prepare."

Seeing Su Nantian had spoken, the group reluctantly gave up. Zhao Ling’s words to keep Su Nantian were stifled.

They slowly descended the stairs. Zhao Ling saw them off at the entrance, saying: "Welcome back to our restaurant anytime. Today’s incident was a bother for Senior Su; thank you for helping." She winked mischievously at Su Nantian.

Su Nantian chuckled, amused by the clever girl: "Today I’ll do something for a future junior. Come to Fengyue University early; we’re waiting for you."

The others smiled in agreement. Cao Yun gently patted Zhao Ling’s head: "Good luck; I believe you’ll get in. Then we’ll have more chances to eat together."

Zhao Ling felt warm, agreeing with a beaming smile.

After seeing them off, Zhao Ling smiled slyly at Su Nantian’s direction before returning to the restaurant to resume work.

……

The group, sated and content, strolled along the sidewalk. The university was just across the street, a short distance away.

Cao Yun walked on Su Nantian’s left, occasionally glancing up at him before blushing and staring at her shoes.

Su Nantian’s sharp eyes had already noticed Zhao Yun’s subtle actions, but he simply smiled without warning her.

Chapter 208: Sensation

The news of Su Nantian’s class facing the second class in a volleyball match spread like wildfire across Fengyue University. Most students were already intrigued by Su Nantian, and this match was a spectacle they couldn’t miss.

This incident began before the semester started when Su Nantian had beaten two formidable seniors and then hospitalized Shen Fei on the first day. It immediately captured everyone’s attention.

Even if Su Nantian hadn’t intentionally started it, no one wanted to miss this opportunity to watch the chaos.

That afternoon, almost half of every class had asked their advisors for leave, demanding to watch Su Nantian’s match.

Even Qian Fachen, who had always been arrogant, felt a surge of pride when he learned everyone was watching. He believed they were all coming for him. But after his subordinates told him they were actually coming for Su Nantian, Qian Fachen’s anger spiked. His desire to teach Su Nantian a lesson intensified.

He had lost the popularity he’d just gained, turning it into enemies.

In Qian Fachen’s eyes, no one should be more arrogant than him.

……

Su Nantian sneezed lightly as they reached the school gate. Cao Yun was startled and asked: "What’s wrong? Are you unwell?"

The words “unwell” sent the five students into a panic. Liu Yang hurriedly asked: "Senior Tian, are you unwell? Are you unwell?"

The Gao brothers also prepared to carry Su Nantian: "Senior Tian, we’ll take you to the infirmary." They were about to approach when Su Nantian’s lips twitched, keeping a distance. He rubbed his nose, still sore from the sneeze: "I know my body; I’m fine."

After saying that, Su Nantian deliberately avoided them and walked toward the playground.

The group exchanged glances, feeling ashamed for their earlier cowardice. They hurried to catch up with Su Nantian’s pace.

Su Nantian's physique was not ordinary; it was a blessing after his reincarnation, saving time on physical cultivation. Even his immunity was hundreds of times stronger than an ordinary person’s.

Thus, catching a cold was naturally impossible for Su Nantian, something he knew well.

Thinking this through, Su Nantian frowned inwardly: Why did I feel someone was talking about me behind my back?

Sure enough, when Su Nantian and the group arrived at the playground, he was stunned. He twitched his lips.

The field was already packed with people, and the match wasn’t even scheduled for forty minutes yet. Su Nantian surveyed the crowd in various outfits, confused.

A shadow rushed toward him from afar. As it got closer, Su Nantian realized it was Instructor Chen Ping. Chen Ping ran toward Su Nantian.

Su Nantian and the group also approached the instructor, closing the gap between them.

When Chen Ping reached Su Nantian, his face was unreadable—whether excitement or concern.

Su Nantian disliked guessing others’ thoughts, so he asked: "So many people? What’s going on? Are we about to review?"

Instructor Chen Ping shook his head, saying solemnly: "You’ve already made a name here. Everyone is curious about you."

Su Nantian’s lips twitched. Chen Ping continued: "Hearing of your two previous achievements, but they weren’t present to witness it. This time, hearing you’re playing a match, they skipped classes and filled the field. Even those on the viewing platform."

Chen Ping pointed to the viewing platform, and they followed his finger. Indeed, it was packed with people; some even brought fruits and snacks, sitting there for a long time.

Su Nantian was stunned by the banner on the main stage: "Fengyue University’s First Volleyball Match." Below it, tables were set up with the principal and officials.

Su Nantian was surprised, asking Chen Ping: "Why did it escalate to the principal?"

Chen Ping explained: "Because so many people asked for leave, it reached the principal. He gave the whole school a holiday to watch this match."

Saying that, Chen Ping grew anxious: "Everyone knows now. We can’t lose! Losing would be a disgrace!"

The group understood Chen Ping’s meaning and even Su Nantian offered an unprecedented reassurance: "We’ll win. Don’t worry."

Then, Su Nantian’s gaze was drawn to a piece of clothing on the main stage. He walked over, and the group exchanged glances before following Su Nantian.

Su Nantian reached the main stage and ignored the principal’s greetings, heading straight for the piece of clothing. It was a corner where actors waited and hosts rested. A sofa was placed there.

At that moment, Wu Lianxing and Gao Jingjing were sitting on the sofa eating fruits. Wu Lianxing’s long skirt had a piece of clothing sticking out.

Su Nantian found them by that piece of clothing.

When Wu Lianxing and Gao Jingjing saw Su Nantian, they both stood up excitedly. Wu Lianxing gave him a big hug: "Congratulations! It’s only been a few days since school started, and you’ve already faced continuous challenges. Your popularity on campus is rising."

Su Nantian smiled: "Enough with the nonsense. How long have you two been here?"

Gao Jingjing was about to say "not long" when the principal squeezed through the crowd behind Su Nantian, smiling sycophantically: "Long enough. They’ve been waiting for you here; they didn’t go anywhere."

Both girls blushed. Wu Lianxing remembered something and hurried to the back to fetch a guqin: "We didn’t come empty-handed. I’ll play a piece for you to cheer you on!"

Su Nantian felt warm, his smile becoming brighter. Cao Yun’s expression darkened. The male group behind the stage envied Su Nantian greatly.

"Wow, is that true? What’s Wu Lianxing’s relationship with Su Nantian? She even came to cheer for him!"

"I don’t know. Although Wu Lianxing is a student here, I’ve barely seen her."

"Ah, I didn’t expect my first meeting would be for another man. Oh, my heart!"

"Never mind, you should be grateful. If it weren’t for Su Nantian, Wu Lianxing wouldn’t have performed so often outside the university. We wouldn’t have had the chance to hear her guqin!"

Chapter 209: Turbulent Currents

Seeing the eyes of everyone on the field drawn to Su Nantian and his group, especially Wu Lianxing’s arrival, Qian Fachen’s subordinates stared at her beautiful face and figure.

Su Nantian glanced over, noticing the group’s drooling and found it amusing.

A bunch of men obsessed with lust… they still wanted to win this match? That was too laughable.

Su Nantian’s subtle change didn’t escape Qian Fachen, who had been watching him closely. Su Nantian hadn’t even tried to hide his emotions.

Qian Fachen followed Su Nantian’s gaze and saw the greedy looks of his subordinates.

He had thought they were slightly undisciplined, but now he realized how hopeless they were. It was truly embarrassing.

Wu Lianxing felt their intense gazes but had no reason to worry. She knew Su Nantian was there, and she wouldn’t be harmed.

She only flashed a slight contempt, surprised these young men dared to flirt with her.

Thinking this through, she glanced at Su Nantian in the crowd, sunlight casting a sacred glow on his head. Wu Lianxing’s lips curved slightly and ignored the hot stares, focusing on tuning her guqin.

Qian Fachen, observing everything, felt his scalp tighten. He restrained himself from clenching his fists and suppressed the urge to strangle his subordinates.

He raised a hand to cover his mouth, "Cough... cough..." This light cough reminded Li Xiao, Qian Fachen’s subordinate.

Li Xiao was also a member of the volleyball team, having followed Qian Fachen for a long time. He naturally knew Qian Fachen was angry now.

Seeing his companions still gazing at the beauty, he elbowed the closest person: "What’s wrong? Can’t you see we’re busy?"

"Exactly, and besides, this is the famous Wu Lianxing. Getting this close might be the last chance!"

Qian Fachen’s face darkened further. If it weren’t for the public setting, they would have been severely punished.

Li Xiao saw the tension rising and couldn’t hold back any longer, speaking in a voice only they could hear: "Are you crazy? Don’t choose the wrong time! Watching videos on your computer in the dorm is fine, but in public, can’t you control yourselves?"

They didn’t understand what was happening and were scolded by Li Xiao, feeling awkward. After all, their family backgrounds were equal; showing faces to whom?

One person was不服气 and wanted to argue, but met Qian Fachen’s icy gaze and dared not speak. They smiled fawningly at Qian Fachen instead.

They received only a cold snort from Qian Fachen.

At this moment, "ding" rang out—a clear sound. The previously noisy students fell silent.

Qian Fachen instinctively looked up, realizing it was Wu Lianxing starting to play. The music surrounded the air, as if a slender hand led everyone’s thoughts, making some people linger and sigh.

"Wow, she really invested a lot to attract the audience..." Qian Fachen rubbed his chin, muttering.

After some time, the music stopped. Wu Lianxing gracefully stood up, holding a microphone with her unique voice: "I’m happy to meet you all. I came here to cheer for my friend Su Nantian. Please support him, thank you."

After bowing, she received applause from the crowd.

"Sister’s voice is so beautiful! Since she supports Su Nantian, we should stand with her!"

"Exactly, Wu Lianxing sister would never support just anyone. And she did it so openly; there must be something special about him we don’t know!"

"Right, Su Nantian, good luck!"

The students at the scene cheered enthusiastically under Wu Lianxing’s lead, shouting "Su Nantian, good luck!"

Even some students from the second class would have cheered for Su Nantian if not for Qian Fachen.

Now the field had two sides: the noisy first class and the lonely second class. Li Xiao, seeing this scene, instinctively approached Qian Fachen, unsure where to put his hands.

Qian Fachen turned and signaled Li Xiao to speak quickly. Li Xiao rubbed his nose, thinking for a moment before bowing and saying: "Senior Chen... look at this situation. We can’t ignore it, otherwise our face would be lost!"

Qian Fachen’s veins bulged. He glared at Su Nantian’s group, unsure what he was thinking, then turned to Li Xiao.

Li Xiao suddenly looked up and was startled by Qian Fachen’s gaze, his palms sweating. He even regretted suggesting this earlier.

Qian Fachen naturally noticed Li Xiao’s discomfort, frowning and beckoning him closer.

Li Xiao didn’t dare to complain, took a few steps and said: "Senior, what should we do?"

Since Li Xiao was slightly shorter than Qian Fachen, he lowered his head and whispered: "This situation you’ve seen. I can’t guarantee victory now, so..."

At this point, Qian Fachen glanced at Su Nantian’s side. Li Xiao followed his gaze and understood Qian Fachen’s meaning.

"Senior's meaning is... we should create some obstacles?"

Seeing Li Xiao understood immediately, Qian Fachen nodded in approval and patted his shoulder to encourage him.

Li Xiao looked at the group across and hesitated, his mind racing: "This Su Nantian... he’s already popular since arriving at school. I heard he beat the former class monitor Shen Fei and left without trouble. He’s probably not easy to deal with, so skip him."

"High family two brothers: they are siblings. If one gets into trouble, the other might not be safe either."

"Liu Yang and Song Tao..."

At this moment, Li Xiao saw Song Jin at the back corner. He looked the weakest among them, wearing glasses that made him appear fragile. As the saying goes, "pick the softest柿子." Hehe...

After choosing his target, Li Xiao smiled and went to report to Qian Fachen.

Qian Fachen listened and turned his gaze to Song Jin, nodding in approval. Then he told Li Xiao: "You go ahead and do it."

Li Xiao received the order, nodded, and patted his chest with a "leave it to me" attitude.

Qian Fachen pretended nothing was wrong and smiled confidently: "Su Nantian, see if you can beat me this time!"

Chapter 210: Injury

The second class had already planned their schemes, while Su Nantian’s first class focused on winning through strength. They never imagined the other side would harm them.

After all, it was a school-wide announced match; even if they cared about winning, no one would dare to act under everyone’s eyes.

But people's hearts could not be trusted, a lesson Su Nantian had learned over two thousand years. Thus, when Su Nantian and the five returned to the locker room for preparation, he first checked everything thoroughly.

Nothing was found. Su Nantian narrowed his eyes. Earlier, Qian Fachen’s smug gaze wasn’t fake. According to Su Nantian's sixth sense, Qian Fachen would definitely send subordinates to sabotage. That’s why he had such a confident smile.

But Su Nantian had already checked everything and found nothing.

The five boys in sports clothes also hurriedly advised: "Senior Tian, stop looking. If there was anything, it would have been found already. We’ve changed into our clothes; you should change too."

Song Jin unfolded Su Nantian’s sports outfit from the bag, shook it, and solemnly handed it to him: "Senior Tian! Good luck in the match. We’ll try not to hold you back!"

Since nothing was found, Su Nantian still couldn’t fully relax. He took the clothes and said to Song Jin: "I haven’t found anything yet, but once we get on the field, you must be careful. Don’t get hurt; it’s secondary to win. Just protect yourselves."

Song Jin and the others nodded quickly. Due to the approaching match, they were all tense. They half-heard Su Nantian’s advice and nodded vaguely before rushing to the field.

Seeing this, Su Nantian sighed inwardly and shook his head, thinking he would protect them well.

As the whistle blew outside, the host’s introduction was nearing its end. Both teams waited at the entrance. Their eyes met, and an invisible spark crackled in the air.

Su Nantian shook his head, sighing: "Youth."

Guided by the host, both teams marched in unison to the sand field. The equipment was already set up for this match. Su Nantian arrived and, while following the referee’s instructions to greet each other and shake hands, used his peripheral vision to scan the sand field for any suspicious signs.

Fortune favors the prepared. Su Nantian noticed something glowing under Song Jin’s position in the sand, reflecting his retina under sunlight.

"Wait." Su Nantian raised his hand to stop the referee from blowing the whistle, interrupting the match. Qian Fachen, already in position to attack, mocked: "What? It hasn’t even started yet, and you’re already scared?"

Su Nantian glanced at Qian Fachen coldly. That icy gaze made Qian Fachen shudder, a hint of retreat in his heart. He shook his head to dispel the thought.

"What’s wrong, Su?" The referee, a school PE teacher, asked as he descended from his high chair.

Su Nantian appreciated this responsible teacher and hurried to Song Jin’s side. Song Jin was confused, about to step forward, but Su Nantian stopped him: "Don’t move!"

Song Jin was startled and froze. Su Nantian bent down, as did the referee.

Su Nantian’s elegant fingers dug into the sand and pulled out a long, thick nail. Its tip had been sharpened deliberately, very sharp. Stepping on it would surely cause bleeding.

Song Jin saw this long nail under his feet and turned pale.

Su Nantian handed the nail to the coach, who furrowed his brows. In all the school’s sports events, this was the first time a nail had been pulled from the sand.

The coach wasn’t foolish; he understood the nail’s meaning.

He raised it high, letting everyone see clearly. The field immediately gasped in unison.

Su Nantian’s gaze shifted to Qian Fachen, who gritted his teeth and glared at Li Xiao, as if wanting to tear him apart. Li Xiao endured Qian Fachen and Su Nantian’s stares, feeling a mountain of pressure on his head.

The principal called over a teacher to take the nail, but Su Nantian’s scrutinizing gaze remained on Qian Fachen.

"Qian Fachen, don’t you think you should give us an explanation?" Su Nantian said coldly.

Song Jin also looked furious, stepping forward and shouting: "You even used such a dirty trick!"

Qian Fachen felt uneasy under Su Nantian’s gaze, but he knew now was not the time to show fear; otherwise, it would be like "there’s no silver here."

Qian Fachen gritted his teeth and defiantly said: "I don’t know what you’re talking about! Do I need to give you an explanation?"

"Maybe it was planted by you. Maybe someone accidentally left it. Why do you suspect us?"

Song Jin was enraged, his chest rising and falling heavily. If Su Nantian hadn’t found the nail, Song Jin might have been injured and hospitalized. Who would benefit then? It was clear enough.

Then, the principal examined the nail but found no conclusive evidence. He ordered someone to check the surveillance and comforted Song Jin: "Alright, I’ve sent people to investigate. The match must continue, but since you were frightened, I’ll allow you to adjust your time. How do you feel?"

Song Jin snorted coldly, and Qian Fachen’s expression softened slightly. Since no evidence was found, it was the best result; they couldn’t ask for much more.

Only Su Nantian remained cold and indifferent: "No need. The culprit is right here, and there’s no fear to adjust."

Chapter 211: Framing

Su Nantian's words were clear to the intelligent.

The two coaches of both classes watched the quarrel without knowing what to do.

Both were their students, and this issue was neither big nor small. It was hard to favor either side.

The two coaches glanced at each other, shaking their heads. They were both headachy and didn’t intervene much.

On the volleyball field, Qian Fachen was enraged by Su Nantian’s words, his face flushed red and pale. The truth was clear to him. That's why after Su Nantian said this, his emotions were out of control again, shouting: "You... you dare to slander us! What kind of trash are your class members? How could they compare with ours? You need to use such underhanded methods. I think you’re afraid of losing and want to frame us!"

Qian Fachen had intended to defend himself but grew more reasonable. The second class also supported him: "Exactly! I think you did it yourselves! You want to frame us. You’re just slandering!"

Su Nantian’s five companions also shouted back: "Nonsense! Who would harm themselves for a match? Do you think there’s no surveillance on the field, so we can’t find out the truth?"

The quarrel intensified until the coach blew a whistle, and both sides reluctantly stepped back, unwillingly returning to their positions.

Su Nantian looked at the group with disdain, his face subtly showing a hint of hostility, making Qian Fachen’s group tremble.

At this moment, the coach blew a second whistle, signaling the third whistle would start the match.

Qian Fachen’s team served first. He held the volleyball but, due to Su Nantian's earlier gaze, still couldn’t control his trembling.

The third whistle was like a rooster’s cry at dawn, and the previously tense volleyball field immediately erupted into war.

Qian Fachen smiled coldly, trying to suppress his trembling body and hit the volleyball fiercely toward a corner of the opposing team.

He had intended to give them an immediate warning, but when he saw Su Nantian return the ball with lightning speed, his team was stunned.

Su Nantian's movement speed was so fast that it seemed like a shadow had passed, not normal human strength!

The returned volleyball landed precisely at Qian Fachen’s feet. The referee blew the whistle, changing the score to 1-0.

The field erupted in cheers, with girls shouting Su Nantian’s name everywhere.

High Jingjing chuckled on the main spectator seat, then playfully poked Wu Lianxing beside her: "Look at them. They dare to call South Tian’s name in front of us."

Wu Lianxing was amused and grabbed High Jingjing's hand: "It doesn’t matter. South Tian won’t leave you, but I will."

The two girls laughed and played together, not worrying about Su Nantian’s match. Since Qian Fachen found Su Nantian, it was decided that Qian Fachen would lose and lose badly.

Today, the two girls met to cheer for Su Nantian, also to let those who often trouble Su Nantian know that his background was solid and not someone easily provoked.

On the volleyball field, Qian Fachen regained his composure, anger rising. He slapped Li Xiao on the head and muttered: "Why didn’t you catch it earlier? Were you stupid?"

Li Xiao took a slap and saw stars, but he forced himself to regain clarity and said: "I... I didn’t see it."

Qian Fachen gritted his teeth, glaring at Su Nantian with the desire to strangle him. But it was still under everyone’s eyes, so Qian Fachen could only suppress his impulse and ordered: "Everyone, stay focused. Don’t let a single ball pass!"

After seeing Li Xiao get slapped, Qian Fachen’s team felt fear. They obeyed his orders and reluctantly agreed.
