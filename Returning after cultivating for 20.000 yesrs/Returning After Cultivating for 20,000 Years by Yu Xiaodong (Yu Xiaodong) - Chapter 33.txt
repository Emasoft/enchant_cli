Su Nantian sighed, thinking that those who formed cliques were still lacking in confidence. Remembering the past in the cultivation world, there had always been people with ill intentions who incited others to oppose him. Yet in the end, they had all met the same fate—did they really believe that a group of mice could become lions?

"Still, you should be careful with Shen Fei. He comes from a powerful family and was raised in admiration, so how else could he have been class monitor for so many years?"

Zhang Mengyao had spoken at length, but seeing Su Nantian remained silent, she felt he was not taking it seriously. So Zhang Mengyao added with a firmer tone: "When you first entered the classroom, there were so many girls gossiping about you. You've completely upstaged Shen Fei's spotlight. Now that he's become class monitor, he might retaliate against you. You must be cautious."

Su Nantian understood that Zhang Mengyao was speaking out of concern, otherwise this girl who usually stayed in a corner would not have spoken so much.

To acknowledge her care, Su Nantian smiled and nodded: "You can rest assured; I've taken it to heart."

Seeing Su Nantian agree, Zhang Mengyao finally nodded and withdrew her hand. But then she blushed slightly: "What I said, just remember it—don't take it to heart."

Su Nantian was taken aback by Zhang Mengyao's shy demeanor, which reminded him of a normal girl. He felt an urge to tease her.

At that moment, Su Nantian no longer wanted to go out for a walk but moved closer toward Zhang Mengyao. Naturally, she dared not meet his gaze directly, but she glanced at him out of the corner of her eye.

As Zhang Mengyao saw Su Nantian approaching, her heart pounded like a wild deer.

Su Nantian watched Zhang Mengyao's breath quicken and couldn't help laughing. Her face, hidden beneath her bangs, turned red, but she still tried to appear composed.

This made Su Nantian's teasing even more intense. As they grew closer, Zhang Mengyao could not withstand his advances and suddenly turned her head—only to collide with Su Nantian's face.

They both took a few steps back in surprise.

After creating a safe distance, Zhang Mengyao scolded: "Why did you get so close to me?"

Su Nantian shrugged, looking innocent: "I just wanted to say thank you quietly."

Zhang Mengyao turned crimson.

Meanwhile, at the other end of the classroom, Zhu Ying had just left. The other boys quickly gathered around Shen Fei, who sat in the center with a composed demeanor, yet his presence was like that of an emperor.

The new term had begun with the intention of mutual acquaintance, but those who originally wanted to befriend Su Nantian hesitated between him and Shen Fei, ultimately choosing Shen Fei, the newly elected class monitor.

As more people surrounded Shen Fei, his pride grew, but he maintained a nonchalant expression. This was precisely the joy of Shen Fei—enjoying being the center of attention, listening to flattery that made him feel superior and elated.

"Class Monitor Shen, your performance today was truly admirable. Please continue to look after us."
"Yes, monitor, I believe under your leadership, our class will leave a significant mark in the school's history."

In an instant, everyone vied to flatter him with unique words. Shen Fei was pleased.

Yet his thoughts never left Su Nantian, the biggest rival he had. The infatuated girls were all fixated on him, which made Shen Fei inexplicably angry.

Suddenly, a thousand schemes to incite discord and tarnish Su Nantian's image flooded his mind.

While Shen Fei continued to nod and smile at the flattery around him, he said with a humble gesture: "It's your support for Shen Fei."

But in his mind, he was already scheming how to make Su Nantian fall from grace and be expelled from the class.

At that moment, everyone's admiration for Shen Fei grew, but none could see the evil hidden beneath his false exterior.

In contrast, Su Nantian's disdain for the class monitor position left him ignored. They were even more convinced that their choice was correct and planned to strike against Su Nantian in front of Shen Fei, quickly building a harmonious relationship with him.

The girl who had first stood up to invite Su Nantian to run for the position now leaned against Shen Fei's desk, praising him endlessly.

Yet her eyes were clearly discontented as they glanced toward Su Nantian.

This glance caught the girl's attention, and she felt even more uneasy. If she couldn't gain Su Nantian's attention, then let him leave. Shen Fei was no worse.

So she pointedly and mockingly said: "Look, is Su Nantian fond of that ugly Zhang Mengyao? They're already cozying up so fast. It's disgusting."

Everyone followed her gaze.

Seeing the attention was drawn, she seized the opportunity to speak at length:
"What kind of person is Su Nantian? He refuses to sit in the available seats and instead chooses to sit with that ugly girl!"
"Earlier, I kindly asked him to run for class monitor, but he looked down on me!"

Chapter 153: Anger

Huyu's words directed at Su Nantian caused the others to follow suit.
They were used to such situations, and their words came naturally. After all, someone was willing to take the lead; they were happy to stoke the fire behind.

"Yes, Su Nantian's arrogance and pride are nothing compared to our class monitor's modesty."
"His looks are good, but he prefers ugly girls!"

Everyone burst into laughter.

Some girls' eyes toward Zhang Mengyao seemed to have a deeper poison.

Sitting in the center of the crowd, Shen Fei's eyes flickered. This was a good opportunity to seize. He felt his position as the newly elected class monitor was still unstable, and Su Nantian was a major threat. If he followed this path, Su Nantian would never recover in the class.

Thinking of this, Shen Fei's breath became unsteady. He took a deep breath and spoke with a composed demeanor: "Classmates, we are one family. Although what they said is true, Su Nantian and Zhang Mengyao would still be hurt."

These people had been whispering quietly, their voices low. They didn't want Su Nantian to hear, fearing his retaliation.

After Shen Fei spoke, some of the officials' sons understood what he meant. He didn't say they were wrong but suggested they speak louder, implying to continue mocking Su Nantian.

Immediately, those official sons took the lead, their voices no longer carefully controlled but gradually louder, as if they wanted Su Nantian to hear.

"Since Su Nantian did that, can't we say anything?"
"Yes! He refuses to sit in the seats with beautiful girls and instead chooses Zhang Mengyao, who's ugly. Who does he think he is?"
"We kindly advised him to run for class monitor, but he turned his nose up. How pretentious!"
"Yes! So proud, why not become a monk?" Huyu joined in the mockery, adding a scornful glance at Su Nantian.

Shen Fei couldn't help laughing, though the sound was small. But he was the center of attention now, and they naturally watched his every move.

Seeing Shen Fei laugh, the insults toward Su Nantian and Zhang Mengyao poured out like a flood.

Shen Fei heard the words becoming more exaggerated and felt he needed to intervene before it seemed he didn't care about others' feelings or knew how to mediate the class's disputes.

He remembered when he was in high school, someone had used this to report him to the head teacher, leading to his first reprimand. In the end, that student was also ruined by Shen Fei and couldn't take the college entrance exam.

Shen Fei quickly stood up, his face showing concern: "Alright, stop arguing. Su Nantian and Zhang Mengyao are both part of our class. Please don't argue anymore."

The people stopped mocking, each staring at Shen Fei, signaling him to continue.

Shen Fei smiled with gratitude toward everyone and said: "Moreover, if it weren't for Su Nantian's restraint, I wouldn’t have been able to lead our class..."

Among these people was He Wei, who had studied in the same class as Shen Fei since middle school.

He Wei understood every move Shen Fei made and the meaning behind each word he spoke.

He Wei was afraid of angering Shen Fei; over the years, he had seen how Shen Fei dealt with those who hindered him. Some were even deprived of their chance to take the college entrance exam.

The words Shen Fei had just spoken were clearly still resentful of Su Nantian as a threat. He Wei wiped his forehead, feeling the tension. Shen Fei's mind was like a rollercoaster—unpredictable and dangerous.

So He Wei shouted: "Monitor! You shouldn't say that. You were elected by everyone, and your kindness is known! Unlike some people, they look good on the surface but are actually something else!"

"Yes! A man who sits with that ugly girl must be a pervert!"

Everyone burst into laughter again. Shen Fei was pleased and spoke a few more words to pacify, while He Wei's leading role caused those around Shen Fei to mock Su Nantian and Zhang Mengyao even more.

Shen Fei pretended to hold his head, looking very troubled, but his eyes glanced at He Wei behind him. Shen Fei had a vague impression of He Wei, who had been in the same class since middle school. Every time he wanted to flatter Shen Fei, he was pushed aside by those around him.

This time, even Shen Fei hadn't expected to meet He Wei here. However, he was extremely satisfied with He Wei's effect and had already begun to consider cultivating him.

On the other hand, Su Nantian and Zhang Mengyao had just finished teasing each other when they heard the class's mockery. Su Nantian frowned, and Zhang Mengyao put her earphones back on.

Neither of them had expected the class to mock so intensely, using both black and white words without stopping.

Zhang Mengyao was so angry that she trembled, grabbed her phone, and adjusted the volume to maximum. Yet she could still hear the insulting words, each louder than the last.

Zhang Mengyao forced herself to ignore it and kept a calm expression, but when they said "you must have done something bad in your past to look like this," she realized tears had silently fallen down her face. She quickly grabbed a tissue to wipe them away.

Su Nantian saw Zhang Mengyao's pitiful state and his temple veins throbbed.

He wasn't one to start a fight, but his patience had limits.

He was angry, and his aura rapidly froze, his eyes as if covered in ice—terrifying.

If anyone familiar with him saw this, they would have fled immediately. But these people seemed like fearless calves and continued to make noise.

Chapter 154: Conflict

Cao Yun sat in her seat, like an observer watching from the sidelines. Even so, she saw Su Nantian's cold eyes and furrowed her brows.

Su Nantian took a deep breath, suppressing his anger, and looked toward Shen Fei. Their eyes met.

Normally, Shen Fei would have returned Su Nantian's gaze with a provocative and arrogant expression. But today was different; so many eyes were watching, and Shen Fei had decided to portray himself as an innocent victim.

So he feigned a guilty expression and nodded twice at Su Nantian, indicating him not to be angry.

But this gesture seemed like a monkey performing for himself in Su Nantian's eyes.

This childish game made Su Nantian even more disdainful.

But this gaze made the people around Shen Fei even more upset.

"Wow, who is this person? Our class monitor is such a good guy, and you look at him like that!"
"You're talking about us, so why do you look at us like this?"
"Yes! We advised him to be harmonious, but Su Nantian is such a person. If you dare to look at us like this, we'll fight!"

They thought that with their numbers, Su Nantian would cower.

But they didn't know that together, they were nothing compared to Su Nantian.

Su Nantian let out a cold snort and slightly released his aura. Some people felt a gust of wind, their skin prickled with goosebumps, and the classroom fell silent for a moment.

But soon after, some people foolishly thought it was because the windows weren't closed and started making noise again.

Su Nantian's veins throbbed, and he barked: "Noisy!"

This voice wasn't loud compared to theirs but unexpectedly caused their eardrums to hurt, ringing continuously.

Su Nantian watched the classroom fall silent again and coldly said: "Who was不服? I'll send him to the hospital too."

Everyone gasped in unison but no one dared speak.

"Bang!"
"Oh, I said, we're classmates. What attitude is this?"
"What's with all that? You even mention an ambulance, acting like you're so strong."

Shen Fei suddenly slammed the table and stood up to question Su Nantian. The others were startled by this sudden sound.

A boy nearby wanted to start cursing but saw it was Shen Fei, the new class monitor, and immediately backed down. He muttered, "I can't fight but I can run."

He quietly moved back.

Shen Fei's slap was strong, and due to his martial arts training since childhood, he felt no pain. But the table had a clear palm print.

Others saw this print and felt fear, as the person who was once kind now seemed so strange and violent.

Some people's eyes even showed envy, thinking that one palm could leave such an imprint—how strong! If it hit a person, bones would break.

The table's trembling spilled hot water over a student, who wanted to curse but saw the palm print and held back. He endured the pain without a sound, retreating to the side in tension.

Shen Fei saw this and said nothing but glanced at him, thinking he was as annoying as that self-righteous person.

The tension between Su Nantian and Shen Fei was about to ignite, so people with sense kept their distance.

Seeing Su Nantian stay silent, Shen Fei thought he was afraid and felt even more triumphant. He looked at the palm print, thinking himself an invincible hero.

From the moment this kid walked in, he had disliked him. But he had no reason to deal with him and no authority as class monitor. Now was the perfect chance to catch his mistake and teach him a lesson, making him kneel and sing "Conquer."

Thinking of this, he felt excited. His tiny eyebrows looked at the people around him with satisfaction.

"What attitude? What right do you have to ask me what attitude I have?"

Su Nantian let out a cold snort and glanced at him.

How dare anyone talk to him like that? Who was this kid?

"I told you, Su Nantian. I am the class monitor! If you do something wrong, I have the right to educate you!"

Shen Fei's emotions were out of control. He shouted at Su Nantian, even spitting some droplets on the table.

"Did you hear those people talking trash in your ear? You're deaf?"

After saying this, Su Nantian took out his hand and rubbed his ear: "But I'm not deaf."

Shen Fei's face turned dark. Who didn't know his abilities? No one dared to act like that in front of him.

Another short boy, He Wei, saw Shen Fei's bad mood and quickly spoke for him: "He is our class monitor. We all call him 'big brother.' Otherwise, you'll regret it!"

Su Nantian smiled at Shen Fei's dog and said coldly: "I really don't respect him. What can you do?"

"You..." He Wei didn't expect his response and was at a loss for words.

Shen Fei became even more angry, but it was his first day as class monitor. If he retreated in front of everyone, no one would follow him afterward.

So he came up with a plan he thought was perfect: "Let's both take a step back. You just apologize to us today, since you scared the other students. That's it, and no one will mention it again."

This plan sounded good but didn't hold up to scrutiny. Su Nantian was no fool and saw through his real intention immediately.

"Playing the good guy, huh? I really don't care for that."

Su Nantian didn't take the bait: "Impossible. You might as well dream at home."

Shen Fei heard this and was furious. His face turned a deep red.

Some girls saw Su Nantian's boldness and whispered:
"Su Nantian is so manly."

This comment accidentally reached Shen Fei, making him even more embarrassed.

He suddenly became angry and took off his clothes, pointing at Su Nantian's nose: "You bastard, don't take the chance!"

Chapter 155: Cao Yun's Decision

Zhang Mengyao was extremely worried, fearing something would happen to Su Nantian. But she knew she had no right to advise him, so she leaned sideways and watched his situation.

Su Nantian had no patience for further words and wanted to silence him with action.

He suddenly moved forward, like a ghostly figure.

"Bang!"

Shen Fei was punched in the chest by Su Nantian, spitting out a mouthful of blood. He looked painful and staggered back a few steps.

"Damn..." Some boys couldn't help but exclaim, swallowing their saliva and thinking it was lucky they hadn't angered him.

"Damn!"

Shen Fei cursed, thinking Su Nantian's punch was too strong and almost knocked him down. But his body had always been strong.

He thought of this and smiled again.

But Shen Fei didn't know that Su Nantian had only stretched his muscles and hadn't started to fight seriously. If he didn't fear shocking them, he could have taken them down in a moment.

Shen Fei steadied himself and retaliated, kicking his leg to try to push Su Nantian aside. But he was easily caught by Su Nantian, who lifted him up and threw him.

"Ah! Ah! Ah!" A pig's scream erupted.

But he still didn't give up, his iron-like fists with a roaring wind suddenly changed direction and smashed at Su Nantian's back. If this punch landed, he would be dead or crippled.

But Su Nantian saw it and smiled slightly, his face full of disdain.

Then he turned around and slapped him.

Shen Fei flew through the air like a kite without strings, directly hitting the wooden board at the back of the classroom. The board shattered into two halves.

"Pu..." Shen Fei lay on the ground, trying to get up but eventually stood up with trembling legs.

Su Nantian smiled slightly: "I didn't expect you to have some backbone."

"Take your life!" Shen Fei rushed toward Su Nantian with his fists.

But Su Nantian lightly waved his hand and knocked him down again.

"Tsk..." Su Nantian stood with his arms crossed, looking down at him.

Shen Fei lay on the ground, unmoving. The brothers who had previously flattered him sat at their desks without turning around. Even He Wei trembled and dared not move.

Shen Fei understood what it felt like to be betrayed by everyone. He didn't know whether he hated Su Nantian or those people.

No one dared to help him.

The girls didn't need to be mentioned; they wished to hide their heads like ostriches.

No one dared to move...

The class monitor, Cao Yun, sat at her seat with her hands on her knees, unsure of what to do.

Her fists clenched involuntarily and trembled.

She had never imagined a boy with such high looks could fight so well. Even if she hadn't seen clearly, the reactions of other girls indicated his moves were definitely powerful.

But that was just a common student's view... she was the class monitor now.

Especially seeing Shen Fei lying down and no one helping, Cao Yun felt everyone was waiting for her reaction.

Her back felt like it was being pricked, and the white jeans on her legs turned pale from her fingers.

Cao Yun struggled in her mind. She was a small girl with no strength, and she couldn't do anything. She even feared the power Su Nantian had unleashed.

But her good upbringing urged her to move forward. After all, she was the class monitor and had a leadership role.

"Stop!"

Cao Yun didn't know how she said it, but when she realized it, her legs had already stood up.

Her voice was unusually loud in the quiet classroom, and everyone looked at her.

Surprised... curious... even Su Nantian turned around.

Cao Yun saw Su Nantian and felt a big part of her courage was gone, but she kept her composure and said: "How could you beat a classmate in the classroom?"

At this moment, Shen Fei supported himself on the table and sat down slowly. He couldn't stand up now.

Su Nantian had no intention of answering Cao Yun's question and sat on the table with his hand.

Cao Yun was stunned by Su Nantian's indifference and looked around at the classmates, who all stared at her. No one dared to move.

She was frustrated: "What are you all staring at? Don't you hurry and call 120!"

"Ah, ah..."

They finally came to their senses and took out their phones.

"Hello? Is it 120? This is Fengyue University, a student was injured. Please come quickly..."

After someone called the ambulance, Cao Yun sighed in relief. She glanced at Su Nantian on the table and hurried to help Shen Fei sit on a chair.

Shen Fei looked down at the slender hands that supported his arm and remembered how no one had dared to approach him when he fell. His heart felt bitter.

He knew those people were unreliable, but he hadn't expected it to be so obvious.

Shen Fei lowered his head and looked at his toes without speaking.

Su Nantian knew he had understood something, so he said no more.

After arranging Shen Fei, Cao Yun saw the classroom was in disarray and said: "You all stay here. I'm going to call the counselor."

The students saw the great class monitor vanish like a breeze.

Once it had started, one couldn't back down. Cao Yun could only finish this matter.

She was now going to the office to find counselor Zhu Ying, and this matter had to be reported to the homeroom teacher.

"Knock knock!" She arrived at the office door and didn't care about etiquette, knocking immediately.

"Come in."

A voice came from inside—Zhu Ying's unique tone.

Cao Yun pushed the door open and panted, bending over to point outside: "Teacher, Su Nantian and Shen Fei fought in the classroom!"

"What?!" Zhu Ying heard this and stood up immediately, pushing the desk forward and following Cao Yun out of the office.

On the way, she asked: "How serious is the injury? Did you call an ambulance?"

"Yes, yes!"

The distance from the office to the classroom wasn't long. After running for a few minutes, they arrived at the classroom door.

High heels echoed in the corridor. Zhu Ying pushed open the classroom door, and the students were already sitting properly.

Even Su Nantian got off the table and returned to his seat.

Zhang Mengyao secretly poked Su Nantian's arm: "Now you're in trouble!"

Su Nantian turned and smiled, indicating he was fine.

Chapter 156: Calling the Principal

Zhu Ying first approached Shen Fei to check his injuries. At this moment, Shen Fei had fainted.

She touched his nose.

At least he was still breathing... Zhu Ying sighed in relief and sent a few students to take care of him. Then she approached Su Nantian.

This was because Su Nantian had deliberately lightened his punches; after all, it wouldn't be good to have a death on the first day. They had only spoken harshly.

Zhu Ying felt something about Su Nantian—his appearance was impeccable, but he was arrogant. If it weren't for this incident, she wouldn't have interfered with him.

Zhu Ying crossed her arms and looked down at Su Nantian, standing as tall as him with high heels.

"Sus Nantian, can you explain what happened?"

Hearing the beautiful teacher speaking to him, Su Nantian lifted his eyelids and said: "They spoke ill of me, so I taught them a lesson."

"Teacher, he's lying. He just didn't like us!"

At this moment, several people who often followed Shen Fei spoke up. Their courage grew because someone was protecting them.

Su Nantian heard their words and sneered:

"What attitude is this?" Zhu Ying frowned.

"Teacher, I think my attitude is good. But it seems someone's attitude is better than mine—they even licked your face!"

He looked at them with a smile.

They fell silent and sat on their desks.

"Teacher, it was definitely them who spoke ill of me," Zhang Mengyao stood up and said.

Zhu Ying's frown deepened: "I'll investigate this matter, but Su Nantian, fighting in the classroom—don't you fear expulsion?"

Su Nantian laughed as if he had heard a joke. Expulsion? He would be grateful for it.

But he didn't show this thought, only said: "Have Yuan Xiong come and see what he says."

Hearing this, Zhu Ying became even angrier. She took out her phone and called, but Zhang Mengyao saw she couldn't stop it and said nothing.

Zhu Ying was a new counselor at this college, meeting these students for the first time. However, some of them had powerful backgrounds; the school would secretly inform Zhu Ying about them. This was a common practice in the college.

After all, this college had mixed people—many young people with strong backgrounds were sent here to gain experience, and many others who had passed the entrance exams through their own abilities. But they all had one thing in common: not concealing their sharpness.

The second-generation sons of officials, relying on their family's strong background, caused trouble without restraint. Those who had passed the entrance exams through ability also didn't conceal their sharpness.

Therefore, although each student's strength was higher than other colleges, the school still had a strict rule: no fighting or brawling. If there was any conflict, it should be resolved on the school's designated stage one-on-one, and the school would not bear any risk.

Every year before the new students arrived, the school had a special person to guide each counselor, telling them about each student's differences and what to pay attention to. For those who needed special care, it was detailed.

Zhu Ying was already headachy. It was her first time as a counselor, and she had encountered this incident just a few days after the start of term. It even reached the point of calling an ambulance.

Zhu Ying looked at Su Nantian with concern, but the moment she saw him, she felt a wave of anger.

When did Su Nantian sit on the table with his legs crossed, looking down at Shen Fei who was lying unconscious?

Plus Su Nantian's casual mention of Yuan Xiong, Zhu Ying was even more angry. But more than that, she felt concern for Su Nantian. It had been just a few days since the term started, and he had already caused such a big problem.

But the immediate priority was to call Yuan Xiong and let him decide how to handle this matter.

Zhu Ying skillfully opened her contact list but was confused about Yuan Xiong's note due to too much thinking.

Zhu Ying quickly flipped through it.

Fortunately, Yuan Xiong had been planning to approach Zhu Ying since she arrived, so he called her every few days. Yesterday, they had just spoken on the phone.

Zhu Ying quickly found Yuan Xiong's number and dialed it.

The call was answered immediately, and Yuan Xiong greeted with a happy voice: "Hello."

Zhu Ying hadn't even finished her explanation when Yuan Xiong spoke, so she quickly explained:

"Principal, this is Zhu Ying. Yes... our two students fought and it was serious. What?" Zhu Ying furrowed her brows again, then said: "Expulsion? No, no. One is Shen Fei, the other is Su Nantian... Principal, don't be angry. The ambulance is coming soon. Alright, I'll wait for you here."

Zhu Ying hung up the phone but looked down on Yuan Xiong even more. He was clearly a sycophant.

Meanwhile, in Yuan Xiong's office, the phone call was like a death warrant that made him jump up. He hurriedly put on his shoes, took off his coat and tie from the rack, and rushed to put them on. He didn't even care if they were neat and grabbed his phone, rushing out of the office like a wind.

Zhu Ying paced anxiously in the classroom. Her eyes were fixed on Shen Fei lying on the ground. After he had groaned a few times, Su Nantian might have found him annoying and glanced at him coldly. Shen Fei immediately fainted, and now he had no breath except for breathing.

Zhu Ying's head felt like it was splitting in two. Time moved too slowly; the ambulance was delayed because the hospital was far away, but why hadn't Yuan Xiong come yet?

Zhu Ying's eyebrows were furrowed. She decided to stand at the classroom door waiting for Yuan Xiong. The classroom was full of people, but no one dared to speak up or make noise in front of Su Nantian.

Those who had previously supported Shen Fei were already against the wall, eager to stay away from Shen Fei and Su Nantian. Only He Wei sat on the ground, lifting Shen Fei's head onto his lap to make him comfortable.

Chapter 157: Trouble

It wasn't that He Wei was particularly noble, but he thought that among those who had mocked Su Nantian and Zhang Mengyao earlier, he was the most enthusiastic. If he didn't hold on to Shen Fei's leg now, in the future, the other students might all eat him.

Although Shen Fei was nothing compared to Su Nantian, he was still the class monitor and could keep these students under control.

He Wei thought he had made a good plan.

After Zhu Ying paced around the classroom several times, she finally saw a group of people running towards her from the end of the corridor. As they approached, she saw Yuan Xiong's fat belly and hurriedly waved to the principal and other leaders, shouting: "Principal, here!"
