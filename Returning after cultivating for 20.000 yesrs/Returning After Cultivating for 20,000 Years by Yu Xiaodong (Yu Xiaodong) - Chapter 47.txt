Su Nantian listened to Qian Fachen’s words, feeling deeply moved. Qian Fachen had already used such rhetoric to charm several aristocratic youths in the crowd, and it would not be long before they would indulge in revelry together.

Yet Su Nantian was neither a man who passively endured nor one of selfless generosity.

“I can accept your apology,” Su Nantian said.

This statement caused Liu Yang to draw a sharp breath, but before he could interject, He Tao pulled him back. He Tao whispered into Liu Yang’s ear: “What are you so eager for? Listen to Su Nantian finish speaking. If you rush out halfway, do you think you’ll be scolded!”

Chapter 222: Remain

Liu Yang glared at Qian Fachen, biting his lip to suppress his anger. He and He Tao stood behind Su Nantian in silence.

This scene was not lost on Su Nantian, who silently praised He Tao for his composure and thoughtfulness. He was certain that He Tao and Liu Yang, working in tandem, would achieve great things.

Not only was Liu Yang confused by Su Nantian’s actions, but the entire crowd watching also seemed puzzled. Those who had hoped for a spectacle lost all interest.

As Qian Fachen apologized, he stiffened when Su Nantian said “It’s not impossible.” His posture, once rigid and confident, now drooped as if defeated.

“But,” Su Nantian said, “not every mistake can be resolved through apology. Show me something tangible.”

“Tangible?” Qian Fachen frowned, asking, “If you mean compensation, the principal has already stated on stage that the school has compensated Song Jin.”

“That was the school’s compensation,” Su Nantian cut in sharply. “Though the school compensated Song Jin, it was because they failed to protect him. What about your part?”

Compared to his family background, offering compensation was merely a matter of money for Qian Fachen. Yet this demand unsettled him deeply.

From the moment he began his apology, Qian Fachen had maintained a restrained demeanor, lowering his head in submission. But now being asked to compensate Song Jin with goods and money felt like a personal boundary had been crossed.

Seeing Qian Fachen remain silent, Gao Zhi realized this was the moment to stoke the fire. He spoke: “A man of principle knows what to do and what not to do. Why do you avoid responsibility? Is compensating Song Jin not your duty? Or were those words just a trick to fool us?”

Gao Zhi’s challenge reignited the crowd’s earlier admiration for Qian Fachen, and their understanding of him vanished instantly.

Qian Fachen noticed this immediately. Since enrolling in the academy, he had sought to cultivate connections who could aid his family’s interests. Whether through volleyball matches or seeking recognition, it was all to stand out in their eyes.

But now, the disdainful glances from these aristocratic youths made Qian Fachen feel utterly defeated. Thus, he had stepped forward to apologize on Li Xiao’s behalf, attempting to salvage his standing.

Yet now the same disdain returned in full force. Qian Fachen had no more fight left, as if drained of all strength. He hung his head and said: “Fine. Everything is my responsibility. I will cover all of Song Jin’s medical expenses, emotional damages, and any related costs.”

Liu Yang, watching Qian Fachen like a defeated rooster, seized the moment to chime in: “Do you know Song Jin’s background? His mother works multiple jobs just to support his education. Now, she must be crying uncontrollably at the hospital. And now you expect her to take care of Song Jin? Her job is surely lost.”

Qian Fachen’s throat bobbed as he clenched his fists, then released them abruptly.

“I understand,” Qian Fachen said. “I will cover all of Song Jin’s future tuition costs.”

Liu Yang nodded in satisfaction. The tuition at Fengyue University was the highest of any institution. If not for its exorbitant fees, Song Jin would not have delayed his entrance by a year. Zhang Mengyao’s brother Zhang Xiaojun would not have worked so desperately in the underworld to earn money.

Now, these two impoverished families—one guided by Su Nantian’s help into stability, the other spared significant costs due to Su Nantian—had found their paths.

“I’ve apologized and promised compensation,” Qian Fachen said through gritted teeth. “Can we leave now?”

Su Nantian caught the unmistakable bitterness in his voice and raised an eyebrow, saying coolly: “You may leave.”

Qian Fachen bit his lip and turned to walk away, with Li Xiao following closely behind.

“But,” Su Nantian’s voice rang out again from behind, “Li Xiao, did I tell you to leave?”

Qian Fachen’s fists trembled from the force of his grip. Li Xiao was stunned, then turned to glare at Su Nantian with a snarl: “Are you determined to keep me from leaving?!”

Su Nantian ignored Li Xiao’s hostile gaze, as if he were a paper tiger with no real threat.

“Let one bear the burden of their actions,” Su Nantian said, hands in his pockets. “Qian Fachen has taken responsibility. Now it’s your turn.”

Li Xiao had been pushed too far today. Initially refusing to apologize, his resentment deepened after Qian Fachen’s submission. He thought: Why did Qian Fachen submit to Su Nantian but act so harshly toward me? Am I not as strong as Su Nantian? No.

Li Xiao shook his head, trying to dispel the thought. Another voice echoed in his mind: “It was Su Nantian’s fault. Qian Fachen should have remained fierce, and that would have been fair!”

It was clear Li Xiao resisted. The truths exposed by his earlier provocation had not escaped Su Nantian, who had lived two centuries and possessed the ability to read minds.

The wounds hidden deep within Li Xiao were already partially uncovered by Su Nantian.

“You don’t have to apologize,” Su Nantian said, his tone less harsh now. “Go and care for Song Jin until he recovers. No one will trouble you during that time.”

Li Xiao was stunned, his pupils widening in disbelief. For a moment, there was emotion in his gaze—but then he thought of returning to the Qian family. The outcome would be the same.

“You’re just talking smoothly, trying to force me to care for Song Jin! This isn’t my intention. Why are you all targeting me? I won’t accept it!”

Li Xiao’s mind was a blur. To him, Su Nantian had become a fraud. Desperate to dispel his fear, he lunged forward with a fist toward Su Nantian.

Chapter 223: Mockery

This time, Su Nantian had no patience left for Li Xiao’s repeated defiance. Seeing him raise his fist again, Su Nantian merely smirked with disdain.

As everyone expected Su Nantian to stand his ground and take the blow, Su Nantian sighed inwardly and raised his fist, striking Li Xiao squarely on the crown.

Su Nantian was half a head taller than Li Xiao, and this height advantage concentrated all his force on Li Xiao’s skull. Li Xiao hadn’t even seen Su Nantian move before feeling a searing pain and collapsing unconscious.

Watching Li Xiao lie motionless on the ground, Qian Fachen showed no concern. His gaze was as cold as if looking at a stranger. This reaction deepened Su Nantian’s dislike for Qian Fachen.

Though Su Nantian hadn’t used much strength, Li Xiao’s ordinary body couldn’t withstand it. He lay still on the ground. Liu Yang worriedly asked, “Senior Nantian, did you kill him?”

Wu Lianxing let out an exasperated sigh. “What are you talking about? Su Nantian knows when to hold back. If you keep saying that, I’ll report you for defamation.” Wu Lianxing said this while poking Liu Yang with her index finger, a warning.

Being scolded by Wu Lianxing, the goddess-level beauty, Liu Yang’s face turned crimson instantly. He dared not respond.

Su Nantian noticed Liu Yang’s reaction and couldn’t help but smile. He patted Wu Lianxing’s head, saying, “Enough, don’t scare him.” Then he leaned down and whispered in her ear: “He’s turned red from your beauty.”

Wu Lianxing blushed and lowered her head, whispering: “Your beauty is all thanks to you.”

Though the words were soft, only Su Nantian could hear them clearly.

Su Nantian smirked and turned back to look at Qian Fachen, who still stood with his back turned. He gazed at the unconscious Li Xiao on the ground without moving, neither helping nor leaving. It seemed he was weighing something internally.

After several minutes, Qian Fachen remained silent and did not lift Li Xiao. Su Nantian sneered: “How can you wake him up just by watching?”

“Li Xiao did so much for you. Now that he’s useless, do you not even want to help him up?”

“Hearing you’ve been together since high school, how thin your feelings are. Should I call you heartless or just a coward?”

This sharp mockery was Liu Yang’s first time hearing from Su Nantian. Instantly, he felt Su Nantian’s ability to insult without using vulgar language was far superior. He instinctively raised his thumb behind Su Nantian.

Qian Fachen glanced at the several aristocratic youths he had targeted, who now looked bored of the farce and left with disdainful glances.

Qian Fachen realized his goal had been shattered. Though this all stemmed from Su Nantian, without Li Xiao’s interference, he thought it might have been better.

Li Xiao lay pitifully on the ground, and Qian Fachen no longer spared him a glance. He didn’t respond to Su Nantian’s mockery, for after today’s confrontation, he knew Su Nantian’s strength was beyond his reach.

Words were futile. Qian Fachen treated Su Nantian’s words as if they weren’t there, the only way to preserve his remaining dignity.

Qian Fachen licked his dry lips and, with a blank expression, turned away from this place of conflict.

His steps were unsteady, but outwardly he tried to appear composed. His strides grew larger, and his hands trembled as he fished something from his sports jacket pocket. Due to the shaking, he failed several times before finally yanking out his phone forcefully.

Qian Fachen clutched the phone, trembling as he typed an unfamiliar number into his contacts. His fingers quivered on the screen, and after a moment of silence, he sent the message swiftly. Then he turned off his phone and put it back in his pocket.

On the other end of Fengcheng, a mysterious person’s phone buzzed. He pulled it out and saw a new message: “I’ll follow you.”

The sender was Qian Fachen.

Su Nantian felt some curiosity about Qian Fachen’s silent departure. From the provocations he had made earlier that morning, Qian Fachen was not someone easily pacified. Yet now, he had left without a word, even ignoring Su Nantian’s mockery.

Su Nantian suspected Qian Fachen had a larger scheme in store, and as he watched his back disappear, a flicker of interest stirred within him.

Liu Yang crouched on the ground, poking Li Xiao’s forehead. Li Xiao had been unconscious for some time but still hadn’t awakened, which troubled Liu Yang. He said: “Now Qian Fachen has left without a second thought, leaving only Li Xiao here. If he doesn’t wake up, where should we take him?”

The crowd had thinned considerably. Those remaining were mostly sincere in celebrating their class’s victory. Before the celebration, they had to deal with Li Xiao lying on the ground.

“Lift him up,” Su Nantian said, stepping over Li Xiao to his other side. Liu Yang also helped turn Li Xiao onto his back and cradled his upper body in his arms.

Su Nantian crouched down, examining Li Xiao’s face. “The sand was soft; he didn’t hit his head.”

“But you hit him hard on the crown,” Liu Yang said.

Su Nantian extended his elegant, long fingers and gently pressed them against Li Xiao’s philtrum. His fingertips gradually applied pressure, causing Li Xiao’s philtrum to redden.

After a while, under the crowd’s concerned gaze, Li Xiao slowly opened his heavy eyelids. The intense light made him squint for a while before he realized he was lying in Liu Yang’s arms, with Su Nantian crouched beside him.

Chapter 224: Awakening

The events of the day felt like a dream replaying in Li Xiao’s mind.

Gradually, his expression darkened—whether from Su Nantian’s blow or the recollection.

The first thing he did after regaining his senses was to search frantically for Qian Fachen’s face in the crowd. He searched again and again but found no trace of him. His body trembled, and his breath grew hurried.

He took a deep breath.

It seemed he had no hope left for Qian Fachen. Leaving was expected, but he hadn’t anticipated this final hope would also be shattered. He had hoped Qian Fachen might pay a small price, even the slightest, and he would be grateful.

Su Nantian spoke calmly: “Qian Fachen has already left. He went after you fainted.”

Li Xiao heard Su Nantian’s words as if sealing the final verdict. He swallowed hard.

After a long silence, Li Xiao let out a bitter laugh. The hostility in him had vanished completely; his trembling body gradually steadied.

“You know how excessive your actions were today. You should have anticipated this moment when you did it.” Su Nantian said.

Li Xiao suddenly looked up, his eyes bloodshot as he gazed at Su Nantian. But then he turned away. He knew he was no match for Su Nantian and had no intention of resisting.

Without Qian Fachen, he had no idea what to do.

Thinking this, he shook his head and said slowly: “Yes, I admit it was my doing.”

“I know this was Qian Fachen’s behind-the-scenes manipulation, but you still acted. So even if it was bloodstained, it was your hand that stained it.” Su Nantian said. “Blame yourself for following the wrong master.”

“Yes…” Li Xiao was stunned, but Su Nantian’s words were true. He nodded repeatedly like a chicken pecking at rice, earnestly admitting his mistakes in hopes of escaping Su Nantian’s wrath and securing a path forward.

Su Nantian didn’t want to say much about this, but he knew that those who were hated often had their reasons: “Now start your performance. Make sure we’re satisfied.”

Li Xiao lowered his gaze for a moment, then nodded heavily under Su Nantian’s eyes.

He then pulled himself up from Liu Yang’s arms, looked around at the crowd surrounding him, and knelt down.

*Thud!*

A dull sound echoed as Li Xiao fell to his knees.

Liu Yang and the others were surprised; they hadn’t expected him to submit so quickly. Their eyes filled with admiration for Su Nantian, thinking they’d have a fight but instead it was resolved in a few words.

Su Nantian, however, wasn’t surprised. If Li Xiao had hesitated even a moment longer, he might have had to help him along.

“I will visit Song Jin during his recovery and sincerely apologize to him until he forgives me.” Li Xiao said, bowing to each person before standing up with difficulty.

After saying this, he turned and walked away in the opposite direction of Qian Fachen, leaving the playground alone.

Liu Yang marveled, placing his hand on He Tao’s uninjured shoulder and sighing: “Senior Nantian just gave this guy a spiritual awakening, right?”

He Tao glanced at Liu Yang and shrugged. Liu Yang’s hand immediately slid off He Tao’s shoulder.

“What are you doing?” Liu Yang straightened up, looking at He Tao: “If it weren’t for your injury, I’d have hit you.” Saying this, he flexed his fists, making a “crack” sound.

This commotion reached Su Nantian’s ears. He glanced over at the two arguing and shook his head with a smirk.

When the second class saw Qian Fachen and Li Xiao leave, they felt no face to stay. They gradually left as well.

This sudden volleyball match ended with Su Nantian’s class winning. Zhu Ying and the instructor were quite proud, greeting other teachers and instructors outside while accepting compliments.

Inside, a classmate shouted loudly: “Wow, we actually won!”

Instantly, the crowd erupted in joyous shouts. One after another, like waves of sound, they hit Liu Yang and the others.

He Tao’s face was beaming. Then he seemed to think of something, his eyes dimming slightly: “It’s a pity Song Jin didn’t see this moment.”

Liu Yang immediately pointed his camera at He Tao and said: “Idiot, look up.”

He Tao was stunned, his dazed expression captured instantly.

“I might become a famous photographer,” Liu Yang said immediately, then pointed the camera at Su Nantian with a slight smile. Even Su Nantian’s two goddesses—Wu Lianxing and Gao Jingjing—were captured without missing a beat.

After several minutes, Liu Yang pressed the “stop recording” button and waved his phone at He Tao with a smug grin: “You just moping around is useless. Look at me, I recorded it directly and sent it to Song Jin in the hospital. Perfect.”

Liu Yang happily clicked send on the recorded video and sent it to Song Jin, who was resting in a VIP room at the hospital.

At this moment, Song Jin had already been transferred to a VIP ward by the school’s arrangement. After the school notified his family about reimbursement, Song Jin finally felt relieved. His family had been under immense financial pressure to support his education; if he were hospitalized and spent ten or so ten thousand, they couldn’t afford it.

But the school had already informed his parents. Song Jin’s mother wept uncontrollably at the bedside, and Cao Yun couldn’t bear to leave immediately. She comforted Song Jin’s mother with gentle words.

“Mrs. Song, don’t cry anymore. The school will reimburse and compensate for all of Song Jin’s expenses. My good friend just called me, saying Su Nantian stood up for Song Jin. The two who injured him will also compensate.”

Song Jin’s mother still cried uncontrollably, saying: “Who cares about those compensations? My son has always been weak. Now his bones are fractured, and it hurts so much! I wish I could take the pain for him!”

Song Jin also felt embarrassed, glancing at Cao Yun with a helpless expression: “Mom, don’t worry. I already said it was painful at first, but after Su Nantian massaged me a few times, I felt no pain at all.”

“Plus the doctor just injected anesthesia. I feel nothing now.”

Chapter 225: Nonsense

Song Jin’s mother took his words as a way to comfort her, not caring about their truth. She continued crying relentlessly.

At this moment, Song Jin’s father returned to the ward with washed fruit, seeing his wife crying. He felt ashamed and smiled at Cao Yun.

“Here, eat this.” Song Jin’s father placed the washed apple in Song Jin’s hand and then gave one to Cao Yun.

Cao Yun politely accepted both hands, smiling at Song Jin’s father: “Thank you, Uncle. Don’t worry about me too much. Please comfort your wife; she’s really upset.”

Song Jin’s father felt even more embarrassed and nodded vigorously at Cao Yun: “I’ll teach her. She’s a woman with long hair and short sight, not understanding.” After saying this, he placed the basket of apples in Cao Yun’s hands and turned to pull his wife from the chair, saying: “Don’t cry here anymore. The doctor said it was just a minor fracture; he’ll be fine in half a month. And we don’t have to pay anything. Why are you crying so much here?”

Song Jin’s father pulled his wife out of the ward and shut the door.

Cao Yun was momentarily stunned but remained polite, placing the apples back in the basket.

Not only Cao Yun was awkward; Song Jin also felt embarrassed lying on his bed.

Cao Yun smiled politely and sat gently in the chair where Song Jin’s mother had just left.

“Today was really troublesome for you. You didn’t need to come here, it’s really hard work.” Song Jin had his leg in a cast and was hanging high. He twisted his neck awkwardly to look at Cao Yun.

“It’s no problem. Su Nantian was worried that Qian Fachen’s people might find the hospital and do something to you. Also, there was no military training today, so I had time. We are classmates; this small favor isn’t a big deal.” Cao Yun smiled as she replied.

Cao Yun’s words made Song Jin realize that all the compensations he received were thanks to Su Nantian. His heart felt even more touched, and he wished to be discharged immediately to thank Su Nantian in person.

This reaction was noticed by Cao Yun, who smiled: “Now just rest and don’t think about school matters. The class called me earlier.”

“They said our class has already won, and not only that, but Su Nantian also publicly demanded Qian Fachen and Li Xiao to apologize for your situation.”

Cao Yun smiled at Song Jin, who was stunned: “I was shocked too when I heard it. And Su Nantian also made Qian Fachen compensate for your hospital expenses and emotional damages, as well as your four years of tuition.”

Song Jin could barely contain his shock. After a long silence, he stammered: “But… my hospital expenses were already reimbursed by the school.”

“That was the school’s, and it doesn’t conflict with Qian Fachen’s. In other words, Su Nantian was helping you in a roundabout way.” Cao Yun replied.

What did this mean? Song Jin naturally understood, but he hadn’t expected that his casual mention of his family background had not only been met with no disdain from Su Nantian’s group but also that Su Nantian had thought of him and fought for his dignity and benefits.

Song Jin gripped the apple tighter, his eyes reddening as tears threatened to fall.

“Ah, don’t cry. If your parents come back, they might think I bullied you.” Cao Yun quickly handed him a tissue.

Song Jin felt embarrassed and wiped his face, saying: “No, when I tell my mom, she’ll cry even more.”

At this moment, the phone on Song Jin’s bedside suddenly rang. He couldn’t move his body easily and reached for it several times without success. Cao Yun quickly stood up to get the phone for him.

She swiftly unlocked the phone and saw a video from Liu Yang’s social media account.

Song Jin’s face lit up with joy, and he quickly clicked to download the over-50MB video. Cao Yun also saw the familiar faces in the video and leaned closer curiously.

“Look, Liu Yang sent this video; they’re all happy now.” Song Jin noticed he hadn’t considered Cao Yun and felt embarrassed, so he extended the phone toward her.

This was a two-minute video showing many faces from his class, all joyfully cheering. From the noisy shouts, Song Jin could discern what they were saying.

“They’re saying we won,” Song Jin laughed and exchanged a joyous glance with Cao Yun, then continued watching the video.

The video now focused on He Tao; when his dazed expression appeared, Song Jin remembered how He Tao had bravely kicked open the toilet door and carried him to the rest room.

At this moment, a tear quietly appeared on Song Jin’s face.

Next, the video showed Gao brothers and Su Nantian. When it reached Wu Lianxing and Gao Jingjing on Su Nantian’s left and right, Song Jin and Cao Yun both gasped.

“Are those Wu Lianxing and Gao Jingjing?” Song Jin muttered, then quickly fast-forwarded to watch again. It was indeed Wu Lianxing and Gao Jingjing.

Song Jin immediately laughed and cried: “Wu Lianxing is my goddess! Why wasn’t I there to see her up close today!”

The video ended with Liu Yang taking a selfie, saying: “Take care of yourself in the hospital, brother. We’ll do our best to make it good for you during this time.”

As the video ended, the final frame remained. Song Jin wiped his face and placed the phone on the bedside table, sighing heavily: “If I had known Wu Lianxing would appear, I’d have gone to the hospital after the match.”

Cao Yun’s expression was strange when she saw Wu Lianxing and Gao Jingjing by Su Nantian. However, skilled at concealing emotions, she quickly returned to normal and comforted: “It seems Wu Lianxing is very familiar with Su Nantian. After you recover, maybe you’ll see her often.”

“Really?” Song Jin’s eyes immediately sparkled with stars, and he quickly responded with joy.

“Of course,” Cao Yun said, “I’ll definitely follow Su Nantian closely. Senior Nantian is amazing and has thought of me so much, doing all this for me. After I recover, I’ll definitely listen to Senior Nantian and be his most loyal disciple!” Song Jin clenched his fists.

Cao Yun’s mouth twitched, and she pinched her temples in discomfort.

At this moment, Su Nantian sneezed lightly and rubbed his sore nose, confused.

This was the second sneeze he had in a short time. Knowing Su Nantian’s constitution, Wu Lianxing was startled and rushed over: “Are you okay? Why did you sneeze?”

Chapter 226: Yang Yan

Su Nantian smiled: “To be honest, this is my second sneeze today.”

“Ah?” This surprised even Gao Jingjing, who rushed over and asked: “Are you feeling unwell?”

“Don’t worry,” Su Nantian said, taking Gao Jingjing and Wu Lianxing’s hands briefly before releasing them.

At this moment, the crowd’s cheers reached a peak. Wu Lianxing was also influenced by the atmosphere and excitedly hugged Su Nantian beside her, saying: “Su Nantian, congratulations on your victory. Although it’s nothing to you, I’m still happy that you won.”

Gao Jingjing watched the two happily hugging and felt no jealousy. Instead, she was touched as she watched them.

Because Gao Jingjing knew Su Nantian wasn’t biased; he always treated everyone fairly. The balance between the three women was never tilted toward anyone. Su Nantian used the same feelings for all three women.

Liu Yang noticed Su Nantian hugging Wu Lianxing and tapped He Tao’s elbow, saying: “Look, look!”

He Tao turned around immediately to follow Liu Yang’s gaze. He saw a pink bubble-like aura surrounding Su Nantian and Wu Lianxing.

This caught the attention of everyone in the crowd, who were now drawn to this handsome man and beautiful woman.

If Wu Lianxing’s beauty was striking, Su Nantian’s appearance was even more ethereal. It seemed as if he didn’t belong to this world. Now, these two high-profile individuals were hugging, and the crowd’s eyes lit up instantly. Applause and whistles erupted.

Wu Lianxing was startled and opened her eyes, which had been closed earlier, then pulled away from Su Nantian. Su Nantian thought Wu Lianxing looked like a startled little rabbit, very adorable.

At this moment, Su Nantian affectionately touched Wu Lianxing’s head, and her face turned even redder.

“You’re good, Senior Nantian,” Liu Yang ran over happily, his face full of gossip: “Senior Nantian, you’ve already taken our school’s goddess. When did this happen? We didn’t know.”

Su Nantian glanced at Liu Yang and said: “When did we meet? How could you know?”

Su Nantian was just speaking casually, but Liu Yang took it seriously and raised his fingers to count. The next moment, he exclaimed: “Wow, Senior Nantian, you’re amazing! Which grade did you get her in high school!”

The crowd gasped and the applause grew louder. Wu Lianxing was stunned, her face turning red instantly. She glared at Liu Yang and said: “You talk too much! Be careful, Senior Nantian might not let you play with him anymore!”

Wu Lianxing said it casually, but Liu Yang took it seriously. Immediately, a wealthy少爷 cried and tried to hug Su Nantian’s arm.

Su Nantian frowned and turned his head, causing Liu Yang to fall into He Tao’s chest, knocking him hard. Liu Yang struggled up but didn’t even bother to comfort He Tao, continuing to cry and beg Su Nantian: “Senior Nantian, I didn’t say anything! You can’t leave me out! I’ve decided to follow you from now on!”

Being begged like this, Su Nantian rubbed his nose and said: “She just said that. Also, I never told you to follow me. Each of you is a少爷 from a powerful family; why are you always trailing behind others? It’s better to focus on your own family business.”

Wu Lianxing, who was mentioned, stuck out her tongue and tried to hug Su Nantian again. She saw Gao Jingjing smiling secretly beside her, so she walked over to Gao Jingjing and held her hand.

The two girls smiled at each other and ignored Su Nantian.

Although Wu Lianxing no longer hugged Su Nantian, the scene still caught the eyes of one person in the crowd.

That was Yang Yan, who had previously pursued Wu Lianxing and was hospitalized after being beaten by Su Nantian.

At this moment, Yang Yan pushed through the crowd and rushed to stand in front of Su Nantian. Wu Lianxing and Gao Jingjing were also surprised by his appearance.

Su Nantian had his hands in his pockets and turned to look at Yang Yan, scanning him from head to toe. He noticed that Yang Yan had recovered well after being discharged.

This scanning put some psychological pressure on Yang Yan, who didn’t want to recall the fact that he had been hospitalized by Su Nantian. But when he stood before Su Nantian, the places where he had been beaten ached subtly, reminding him not to act recklessly.

Yet the scene of Wu Lianxing hugging Su Nantian was deeply imprinted in his mind. He couldn’t accept losing Wu Lianxing and wouldn’t let Su Nantian go so easily.

“Hey,” Yang Yan sneered, looking at Gao Jingjing holding hands with Wu Lianxing and said: “Su Nantian, your luck is really good. One isn’t enough; you need two! Watching these goddess-like girls become like concubines because of you, I’m sure it feels great!”

Su Nantian frowned. He couldn’t tolerate anyone defaming or insulting his three women.

“You didn’t get your teeth broken last time, so I was too lenient,” Su Nantian said.

The crowd heard Yang Yan’s mockery and were stunned, casting inquisitive glances at Wu Lianxing and Gao Jingjing.

Su Nantian’s words were like a heavy hammer hitting Yang Yan’s face, causing him to instinctively cover his mouth and look at Su Nantian fearfully, taking a few steps back.

“You don’t have the courage to bother again; I’ll let you taste my fists again.” Su Nantian said, raising his fist.

The crowd erupted in laughter, making Yang Yan’s face turn even worse. He glared at Wu Lianxing and said: “Don’t be deceived by Su Nantian’s looks! He just has this body and brute strength! You’ll suffer if you stay with him!”

Wu Lianxing looked at Yang Yan disdainfully and didn’t even bother to respond.

This made Yang Yan more painful. He gritted his teeth and glared at Su Nantian: “What right do you have to be with her? Do you even understand her? Dare to challenge me?”

Su Nantian raised an eyebrow: “It seems you still haven’t been beaten enough.” He said, rolling up his sleeves.

Yang Yan quickly added: “Who wants to fight your brute strength? I want to challenge you in music! Dare you?”

Chapter 227: Where Does Confidence Come From?
