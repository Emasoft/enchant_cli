The纠缠 of Wang Feixue caused the nurse's expression to turn completely cold. Having worked for so long, she had never before revealed this dark side of hers; in front of others, the nurse always maintained a warm and smiling image.

But now that Wang Feixue had discovered it, the nurse was unconcerned since Wang Feixue held no real power. The nurse's movements became fierce, and she flung Wang Feixue to the ground.

"Ah!" Wang Feixue fell heavily, her wrist reddened in patches. The elderly man on the bed cried out: "Xue'er... Xue'er..." but his weak voice offered no strength to Wang Feixue.

The nurse glanced at the fallen Wang Feixue and let out a cold snort, like a victorious rooster, strutting to leave.

But as she turned around, a heavy force swept across her face, and with a loud crash, the nurse was slapped to the ground. Her nurse's cap tilted askew, and her hair scattered across her face.

Su Nantian stood nearby, his hand still in the motion of striking. His face was filled with anger.

Su Nantian's slap rang out clearly, and in the ward, four people excluding Su Nantian all looked astonished. The female nurse who had been knocked down was also grimacing in anger.

But when she lifted her head, seeing Su Nantian's features through the disheveled hair, a third of the nurse's fierce expression faded.

"Nantian..." Wang Feixue struggled to stand from the floor, her reddened arm trembling and hanging limply. Su Nantian's handsome brows furrowed as he took Wang Feixue's hand and examined it carefully.

"I'm fine..." Su Nantian's serious expression made Wang Feixue blush. In front of her grandfather on the bed, she felt embarrassed and tried to pull her hand back from Su Nantian's grasp.

But Su Nantian gave no chance for Wang Feixue to do so, his large hand firmly restraining her arm. His palm, however, was slowly channeling spiritual energy into Wang Feixue's flesh.

The vast spiritual power within Su Nantian had long been suppressed in his body's meridians. Upon seeing Wang Feixue's injured arm, Su Nantian unhesitatingly released a thread of spiritual energy to flow into the wound.

A cool sensation came from Su Nantian's palm, and Wang Feixue let out an "Ah" of surprise. After this cool feeling, she felt the pain in her injury had vanished.

"I'm no longer in pain... really." Wang Feixue thought the injury was minor, just a bump or scrape. Now in front of her grandfather, she was more concerned about his expression. She wanted to escape Su Nantian's hand as soon as possible.

"Don't move," sensing Wang Feixue's struggle, Su Nantian was somewhat dissatisfied and said softly: "Look a little longer, then let go." Though he said to look, in reality, Su Nantian's spiritual energy was still slowly seeping into Wang Feixue's body. When the last thread of spiritual energy playfully slipped in, Su Nantian finally released his hand.

The female nurse lying on the floor felt a strange excitement as she watched Su Nantian finish treating Wang Feixue. She secretly wondered if Su Nantian would also be gentle and help her up, checking her injuries?

At that moment, the nurse could not hold back and groaned: "Ah, it hurts so much... I really can't stand up." The nurse cried out with her eyes closed, pressing a hand to her stomach.

This clumsy acting made Wang Feixue even more discontented, her eyes filled with deep disdain.

Su Nantian also stood silently beside the nurse, watching her groan like a sow. He made no move to help her up.

After crying for a while, the nurse seemed tired and took a few deep breaths before opening her eyes. Seeing Su Nantian still standing there with an arrogant gaze, the nurse's face turned completely dark.

At that moment, no matter how handsome Su Nantian was, the nurse felt humiliated. The atmosphere's flames gradually burned, and the nurse pushed herself up with her hands, standing on her feet in one motion.

She took a few steps and approached Su Nantian. Due to their height difference, the nurse looked up at Su Nantian's gloomy face and felt a bit of fear.

But she quickly straightened her back again.

"You hit me!" the nurse shouted, not at all holding back despite it being a hospital room.

Su Nantian frowned but did not respond to the nurse's words. His gaze swept over her from head to toe: disheveled hair, a swollen face from Su Nantian's slap, her height under one meter sixty, and the sign on her chest reading "Head Nurse, Lu Xiaoxu."

Su Nantian let out a cold snort at those three words. Lu Xiaoxu shivered immediately, "What are you laughing about? You hit me and don't even apologize!"

Chapter 248: Humiliation

"You hit a patient's family. Shouldn't you kneel and apologize?" Su Nantian said coldly.

"Where did I hit her!" Upon hearing Su Nantian's question, Lu Xiaoxu's eyes darted around before straightening her back and shouting: "She tripped herself! Why blame me!"

Su Nantian raised an eyebrow and said: "That slap you received was your own doing. No one else is to blame."

"You're lying!" Lu Xiaoxu was so angry she almost jumped. Over these years, she had relied on her position and connections to dominate the seventh floor. No one dared to provoke her, let alone be slapped without reason.

"Do you know who I am? You dare to hit me! Do you think I can immediately have this old man moved out!" Lu Xiaoxu threatened without restraint: "Then the old man has no hospital to treat him. I wonder what these poor people can do!"

Lu Xiaoxu's shouting echoed through the empty corridor, but no one rushed in to pull her away. This made Su Nantian even more disgusted with the hospital, but at that moment, he had a slight interest in Lu Xiaoxu's identity.

"Are you so arrogant that this hospital is yours?" Su Nantian asked.

Upon hearing Su Nantian's question, Lu Xiaoxu thought he was afraid and felt relieved. She didn't care that the slap mark on her face made her look ugly, still confidently standing before Su Nantian with a flirtatious expression: "It's not my hospital, but I still have some say.不信 you try."

"Of course, if you apologize, I will overlook this incident," Lu Xiaoxu's glowing eyes were fixed on Su Nantian's face, longing to immediately have him "legally" married.

"Oh?" Su Nantian raised an eyebrow and asked: "What do you want me to beg for?"

Wang Feixue was stunned, fearing Su Nantian might actually beg this woman. She tugged at Su Nantian's sleeve, her face full of reluctance.

Lu Xiaoxu noticed this and harshly pulled Wang Feixue's hand away from Su Nantian's sleeve. Then she smiled at Su Nantian and said: "I see you're with this woman. I guess you're just a poor person. But it's fine, as long as you give me your contact information, I think I can support you."

Lu Xiaoxu spoke more and more shyly, her face gradually mixed with satisfaction. Su Nantian felt even more disgusted.

Wang Feixue's face turned red and pale again, watching the ignorant Lu Xiaoxu. She shook her head in silence.

"I found out," Su Nantian bent down, his eyes fixed on Lu Xiaoxu's slap mark. His lips curled slightly: "You're thinking too beautifully."

Lu Xiaoxu's face turned red when Su Nantian approached, but it instantly turned paler than a wall upon hearing this.

"You..." Lu Xiaoxu took a few steps back, pointing at Su Nantian's nose: "You dare to say that about me! I did it for your good! Isn't this the best solution!"

The entire ward was filled with Lu Xiaoxu's voice. The old man's eardrums ached, his expression painful as he pressed his forehead. Even Su Nantian with heightened hearing felt a slight pain in his ears, greatly disliking it.

He rubbed his ears and said coldly: "There's another solution. You leave this hospital, the old man will be moved to a premium ward and cared for by more professional staff."

"Haha," Lu Xiaoxu heard this, feeling like a joke had been told. She crossed her arms and scrutinized Su Nantian and Wang Feixue.

Wang Feixue wore a blue long dress, the fabric looked high-end but was not an expensive brand. It cost at most a few hundred yuan, something Lu Xiaoxu often bought and knew well.

But regarding Su Nantian's clothes, Lu Xiaoxu frowned slightly. The fabric looked good, but she couldn't identify the material.

However, Lu Xiaoxu knew that this brand was one she had never seen before, so it must not be a famous brand.

Thinking this through, Lu Xiaoxu straightened her back more. Her face carried a strong sense of contempt and coldly mocked: "With these clothes you're wearing, they aren't even enough to let the old man take a single breath of oxygen. You still need special care. What are you dreaming about!"

"It's better to flatter me, maybe I'll give special care to the old man for your sake!"

Lu Xiaoxu's shameless words made Wang Feixue even more angry. A girl as delicate as a pear blossom stood trembling at the old man's bed, eyes filled with anger staring at Lu Xiaoxu.

The elderly man took a deep breath and reached out to hold Wang Feixue's hand, indicating she should not be angry.

But this comfort made Wang Feixue feel even more guilty towards the old man, and tears immediately flowed from her eyes.

After hearing these words, Su Nantian had no desire to slap her again, as he found Lu Xiaoxu's touch repulsive.

"I sometimes don't understand," Su Nantian said to himself: "Why do some girls have such low character and even worse looks? If..." Su Nantian took a step towards Lu Xiaoxu, "if this girl were cute, even if she was fierce, people would still like her."

Su Nantian smiled: "But you... with such ugly looks and a terrible personality, what courage do you have to live this long?" Su Nantian's gaze was very serious, not like he was lying. But it was this serious gaze that hurt self-esteem more.

Lu Xiaoxu was stunned, then screamed: "You wait for me! You all wait for me!" Her eyes were red, she glared at Su Nantian and Wang Feixue with a fierce expression before running out like the wind.

After dealing with this trouble, Su Nantian felt better. At least he no longer had to see such an ugly woman.

Su Nantian pulled his hands out of his pockets and changed from a teasing expression to one of seriousness, approaching the hospital bed.

The elderly man had become exhausted after that battle and was also weak from eating only a few mouthfuls of porridge.

Chapter 249: Relationship

Wang Feixue wiped her tears and introduced Su Nantian to the old man: "Grandfather, this is Nantian, my..." Wang Feixue's expression was embarrassed and she didn't know how to properly introduce Su Nantian.

Su Nantian smiled down and continued: "Grandfather, I'm Feixue's boyfriend. I'll take good care of her during your illness. Please rest assured and recover well, and when you're better, Feixue's mood will also improve."

The old man was a seasoned person who had experienced much in his business life. Upon seeing Su Nantian, he immediately knew he was no ordinary person.

Plus Su Nantian's sincere promise made the old man even more at ease. The old man's trembling hands extended, his mouth slightly open as he took a few deep breaths. He spoke with difficulty: "Our... our Feixue..."

Before he could say more, the old man's eyes were already misty. Wang Feixue quickly said: "Grandfather! Don't get excited!"

The old man weakly waved his hand and took a few more deep breaths, saying: "I entrust... I entrust you!" The last sentence was said with all his strength, and the tone became stronger.

Su Nantian understood the old man's heartfelt expectation and nodded quickly to indicate he would do so.

Wang Feixue saw this scene, tears could no longer be held back and poured out uncontrollably, disrupting her breathing rhythm.

Su Nantian reached out to hold Wang Feixue's shoulder and gently patted it. This scene made the old man nod in satisfaction.

When Su Nantian saw Wang Feixue's emotions had calmed, he wiped her tears away and smiled: "Alright, don't cry. This is a good thing. Grandfather has acknowledged me. I'll find a way to take care of you and grandfather."

Wang Feixue looked up at Su Nantian, her expression of gratitude was touching.

"Oh, right," Wang Feixue sniffed and walked to the other side, picking up the porridge that Lu Xiaoxu had thrown aside. She held it in her hand, and the cold touch made her frown.

"This porridge is already cold. I'll go buy another one outside," Wang Feixue poured the porridge into a nearby trash can and was about to take the保温箱 (insulated box) out when she heard movement outside.

"Hello, delivery."

Before Wang Feixue could react, Su Nantian had already opened the door and retrieved the delivery.

Wang Feixue was surprised to see Su Nantian holding the delivery and asked: "What do you mean by ordering a delivery!"

"Earlier in the elevator," Su Nantian smiled and lifted the delivery, removing the plastic bags. A series of porridge and soft cakes were placed on the table.

The variety of porridges warmed Wang Feixue's heart.

Su Nantian understood the elderly person's lifestyle and chose mild porridges for food. The old man on the bed, seeing Su Nantian's gesture of care, felt full of gratitude.

"Thank you... thank you..." the old man gasped and thanked, but his weak expression made Su Nantian even more determined to change hospitals.

After removing the food packaging, Su Nantian placed a bowl of opened porridge in Wang Feixue's hand. She nodded gratefully and sat on the other side of the hospital bed to feed the old man.

As she fed each mouthful of hot porridge into the old man's mouth, Wang Feixue gradually stopped crying.

Meanwhile, Lu Xiaoxu rushed to the eighth-floor office with haste. Before she could open the door, her crying voice echoed like thunder through the corridor.

The night shift nurses saw Lu Xiaoxu rushing up from downstairs, her face marked with a slap and very terrifying. They immediately lowered their heads, not daring to look at Lu Xiaoxu's anger.

Lu Xiaoxu was notorious for her arrogance on the seventh and eighth floors, which relied on her cousin Lu Jiajun. Lu Jiajun was a young doctor with some fame in the medical field, and he had been invited to this hospital with the position of vice chief.

The hospital's leadership also valued Lu Jiajun, clearly wanting to promote him for the hospital's future.

Therefore, almost no one dared to challenge Lu Jiajun in this hospital. If Lu Jiajun had any preferences for patients, surgeries, or equipment, the hospital would try to secure them for him.

Recently, Lu Jiajun had transferred his cousin's newly graduated nurse from the vocational school to work at the hospital. Within three months, he had used family connections to promote Lu Xiaoxu to head nurse.

The junior nurses all had reservations about this, but no one dared to speak out.

With Lu Jiajun's protection, Lu Xiaoxu was even more arrogant in the hospital, wanting this hospital to be hers.

"Uncle," Lu Xiaoxu cried as she stumbled into the office, "I was hit!"

Lu Jiajun, who had been looking at medical records on his desk, was startled and looked up to see Lu Xiaoxu's face with a slap mark.

He immediately jumped up from his chair.

"Xiaoxu?" Lu Jiajun frowned and walked over. Lu Xiaoxu immediately hugged his waist and cried: "Uncle, I was hit!"

Lu Jiajun looked at the slap mark on Lu Xiaoxu's face and felt a surge of anger. He shouted: "Who did it! How dare he hit people!"

Upon hearing this, Lu Xiaoxu recounted the incident with embellishments: "I was on night duty at the seventh floor. The old man didn't eat, so I went to feed him. But his granddaughter was watching from outside and scolded me. Then the man she brought with her hit me, Uncle, I was hit!"

Lu Xiaoxu cried like it was no money, and the big tears fell on Lu Jiajun's hands, causing some pain.

"Alright, don't cry now. Let's check your injuries first?" Lu Jiajun comforted his cousin with kind words, but Lu Xiaoxu still wiped her tears and cried. Lu Jiajun then discreetly removed the tears from his clothes.

"I don't want to check my injuries, Uncle! Now you must take care of it, otherwise they'll run away!" Lu Xiaoxu thought that Su Nantian and Wang Feixue, "poor people," would not dare to stay in the hospital after hitting someone. They might have already run away somewhere.

Lu Jiajun thought about it and realized this was true. He then took Lu Xiaoxu's hand and got on the elevator.

Chapter 250: Lu Jiajun

When the two angry people arrived at the door of room 709, they were startled by the smell of food inside. Lu Jiajun, with a bit of surprise, quickly opened the door and saw Wang Feixue feeding the old man.

Lu Jiajun's eyes flickered, there was a glint of light in them.

"Uncle, it's them! They hit me!" Lu Xiaoxu brought Lu Jiajun here and was very confident, her straight back showing her arrogance.

Su Nantian leaned against the wall, watching Wang Feixue feed the old man and answering his questions with a few words.

Outside, two headless flies rushed in, which made Su Nantian's mood that had just eased gradually turn cold again.

Su Nantian cast a cold glance at the two people at the door, and both Lu Xiaoxu and Lu Jiajun shivered. Lu Xiaoxu even took a small step back.

"You... who hit my sister... our head nurse?" Lu Jiajun was frightened by Su Nantian's cold glance and his previously well-prepared threats were all gone. He spoke incoherently.

"Oh," Su Nantian raised an eyebrow and stood up from leaning against the wall, his height adding more. "Sister? No wonder she was so arrogant."

Lu Jiajun felt a bit embarrassed and cleared his throat, pretending to be angry: "How could you treat the nurses like this? They work hard every day to care for patients, but you treated them like that. Hitting people is illegal, do you know?"

"If I report this incident, do you know what kind of judgment you and the old man on the bed would receive!"

Lu Jiajun's words were extremely exaggerated. If it weren't for Su Nantian, Wang Feixue would have already cried into tears. But Wang Feixue looked at Su Nantian beside her, and this tall figure gave her infinite support, allowing her to hold back the fear in her heart.

"If?" Su Nantian caught the keyword of Lu Jiajun's sentence and asked: "If it's 'if,' then you must have another solution, right?"

Su Nantian did not fear Lu Jiajun's threats but was interested in understanding Lu Jiajun's hidden intentions.

"Haha," Lu Jiajun laughed and, upon hearing Su Nantian's question, thought Su Nantian was afraid. He immediately felt better and did not care that the slap mark on his face made him look ugly, still confidently standing before Su Nantian with a flirtatious expression: "It's not my hospital, but I still have some say.不信 you try."

"Of course," Lu Xiaoxu's eyes glowed, fixated on Su Nantian's face, longing to immediately have him "legally" married.

"Oh?" Su Nantian raised an eyebrow and asked: "What do you want me to beg for?"

Wang Feixue was stunned, fearing Su Nantian might actually beg this woman. She tugged at Su Nantian's sleeve, her face full of reluctance.

Lu Xiaoxu naturally noticed this and coldly snorted, pulling Wang Feixue's hand away from Su Nantian's sleeve. Then she smiled at Su Nantian and said: "I see you're with this woman. I guess you're just a poor person. But it's fine, as long as you give me your contact information, I think I can support you."

Lu Xiaoxu spoke more and more shyly, her face gradually mixed with satisfaction. Su Nantian felt even more disgusted.

Wang Feixue's face turned red and pale again, watching the ignorant Lu Xiaoxu. She shook her head in silence.

"I found out," Su Nantian bent down, his eyes fixed on Lu Xiaoxu's slap mark. His lips curled slightly: "You're thinking too beautifully."

Lu Xiaoxu's face turned red when Su Nantian approached, but it instantly turned paler than a wall upon hearing this.

"You..." Lu Xiaoxu took a few steps back, pointing at Su Nantian's nose: "You dare to say that about me! I did it for your good! Isn't this the best solution!"

The entire ward was filled with Lu Xiaoxu's voice. The old man's eardrums ached, his expression painful as he pressed his forehead. Even Su Nantian with heightened hearing felt a slight pain in his ears, greatly disliking it.

He rubbed his ears and said coldly: "There's another solution. You leave this hospital, the old man will be moved to a premium ward and cared for by more professional staff."

"Haha," Lu Xiaoxu heard this, feeling like a joke had been told. She crossed her arms and scrutinized Su Nantian and Wang Feixue.

Wang Feixue wore a blue long dress, the fabric looked high-end but was not an expensive brand. It cost at most a few hundred yuan, something Lu Xiaoxu often bought and knew well.

But regarding Su Nantian's clothes, Lu Xiaoxu frowned slightly. The fabric looked good, but she couldn't identify the material.

However, Lu Xiaoxu knew that this brand was one she had never seen before, so it must not be a famous brand.

"It's better to flatter me, maybe I'll give special care to the old man for your sake!"

Lu Xiaoxu's shameless words made Wang Feixue even more angry. A girl as delicate as a pear blossom stood trembling at the old man's bed, eyes filled with anger staring at Lu Xiaoxu.

The elderly man took a deep breath and reached out to hold Wang Feixue's hand, indicating she should not be angry.

But this comfort made Wang Feixue feel even more guilty towards the old man, and tears immediately flowed from her eyes.

After hearing these words, Su Nantian had no desire to slap her again, as he found Lu Xiaoxu's touch repulsive.

"I sometimes don't understand," Su Nantian said to himself: "Why do some girls have such low character and even worse looks? If..." Su Nantian took a step towards Lu Xiaoxu, "if this girl were cute, even if she was fierce, people would still like her."

Su Nantian smiled: "But you... with such ugly looks and a terrible personality, what courage do you have to live this long?" Su Nantian's gaze was very serious, not like he was lying. But it was this serious gaze that hurt self-esteem more.

Lu Xiaoxu was stunned, then screamed: "You wait for me! You all wait for me!" Her eyes were red, she glared at Su Nantian and Wang Feixue with a fierce expression before running out like the wind.

After dealing with this trouble, Su Nantian felt better. At least he no longer had to see such an ugly woman.

Su Nantian pulled his hands out of his pockets and changed from a teasing expression to one of seriousness, approaching the hospital bed.

The elderly man had become exhausted after that battle and was also weak from eating only a few mouthfuls of porridge.

Chapter 251: Despicable

Lu Jiajun's eyes glanced at Lu Xiaoxu, and that glance made her tightly press her lips, not daring to speak recklessly. Her gaze also lost the previous confident posture.

Lu Jiajun remained silent for three seconds, his face serious as if thinking about something. After a while, Lu Jiajun's dark and uncertain face lifted again. He smiled strangely, that smile's determination made Wang Feixue fearfully clench her skirt hem.

It also made Su Nantian playfully raise a smile.

"I think you're making it up, saying that our Head Nurse Lu Xiaoxu hit first?" Lu Jiajun smiled on his face, walking around the room as if observing the environment.

"There's no surveillance in this room. So, please tell me, what evidence do you have?" Lu Jiajun's tone became more determined. That resolute gaze seemed like thousands of threads, wanting to grind Su Nantian on the ground.

Wang Feixue had not expected Lu Jiajun, a well-known vice chief of medicine, to say such words. She rolled up her blue long-sleeved dress and showed a red mark on her white arms, as if from a bump or scrape.

"You see, this is clearly Lu Xiaoxu hitting first. You have evidence, and I'm not without!" Wang Feixue's voice was soft but carried anger against such shameless Lu Jiajun.

Under the hospital room's lights, Wang Feixue's white arms looked even more pale and smooth. Lu Jiajun's eyes were already fixated on them. Su Nantian frowned and walked over to Wang Feixue, firmly pulling down the sleeves she had rolled up. He completely covered that arm.

Wang Feixue realized she had gone too far and, with Lu Jiajun's eyes also very hot, let Su Nantian wrap her tightly and even moved her arm behind her back.

Lu Jiajun's eyes followed Wang Feixue's arms until they could no longer be seen, then he reluctantly收回 his gaze.

"What do you mean? How can I know if it's true or not? Although your arms have a red swelling from being bumped, maybe it was there before coming to the hospital. Do you want to frame me?"

Lu Jiajun fully displayed his shamelessness, saying: "Don't you know where this is? I don't think you're a good girl. Which good girl would actively show her body to others?"

He rubbed his chin and continued: "If you really are trying to frame me, then that's another law violation. Then this matter won't be as easy to handle as now."

Lu Jiajun's threats were three parts sincere and seven parts ambiguous, leaving four parts unclear as if he wanted to give Su Nantian and Wang Feixue a way out.

"What do you mean?" Wang Feixue frowned and asked: "Just say it directly, don't make me guess."

Su Nantian was surprised. This gentle girl had suddenly become as proud as Gao Jingjing, Wu Lianxing, and Lin Suyun. Only the old man on the bed saw Wang Feixue standing straight, his eyes filled with affection.

Wang Feixue had always been a gentle girl since childhood, but she was also quick to act against injustice. However, after the family's decline, her grandfather had been hospitalized, and each time she came, her pride diminished slightly, replaced with a touch of sorrow and委屈.

Now, seeing Wang Feixue gradually regain her confidence and responsibility, the old man was moved to tears that fell from his eyes, sliding into his hair.

"What do you mean?" Lu Jiajun smiled and looked at Wang Feixue with a burning gaze: "It's better not to be too clear. Let me tell you this."

Lu Jiajun pulled Lu Xiaoxu closer to Su Nantian and Wang Feixue, saying: "You see, this injury is evidence. If it's exposed, whether it's public or private, you'll have a lot to deal with."

Lu Jiajun glanced at the old man's bed and said: "Then the old man will also be affected by you. If he is forced out of the hospital, his condition..." Lu Jiajun frowned and "hmm"ed twice, looking reluctant: "This might not be long for him."

Though cruel, this was indeed the case. Wang Feixue's anger immediately turned into fear and she took a step back slowly.

Su Nantian, who had watched the whole scene, yawned slightly, as if he didn't take Lu Jiajun's threats seriously. Though he didn't regard Lu Jiajun as anything, Su Nantian was still curious about what Lu Jiajun would do.

Sure enough, seeing Su Nantian remained silent, Wang Feixue had a bit of fear. Lu Jiajun became even more arrogant, and that feeling of being untouchable returned to him. He felt calm again but changed his attitude into a kind and amiable doctor's manner.

"Although this matter was your fault, I think there is a solution. Otherwise, if it goes to the hospital director, the patient will also be forced out."

"Of course, this is what we don't want. To protect the patient, we can swallow this委屈 and endure it. But to prevent you two from causing more trouble, I think a better solution is..."

"to become friends. What do you think?"

At the end, Lu Jiajun was somewhat excited and his eyes, filled with lust, directly fixed on Wang Feixue. This made Wang Feixue shiver and hide behind Su Nantian.

Meanwhile, Lu Xiaoxu also jumped out excitedly, pointing at Su Nantian and saying: "And you too, quickly give me your contact information. Next time I invite you out, you must accompany me. Otherwise, this old man will be sent away!"

Lu Xiaoxu didn't care about her swollen face and smiled happily, pulling out a phone from her pocket. She skillfully opened the social software's QR code and was about to rub it against Su Nantian's face.

A perfume that didn't match a nurse came towards Su Nantian, making him feel uncomfortable. He immediately kicked Lu Xiaoxu out.

This kick was harsh, and Lu Xiaoxu couldn't get up for a while, crying "Ah-ah" loudly.

Lu Jiajun was startled by this scene and after a moment of hesitation, quickly ran over to help Lu Xiaoxu up. Lu Xiaoxu was in pain and couldn't recognize who was in front of her, still crying: "Uncle, it hurts so much! Uncle!"

Chapter 252: Zhou Qing

"Here, here!" Lu Jiajun anxiously wiped away all the tears on Lu Xiaoxu's face. His eyes were fierce as he glared at Su Nantian.

"Don't be too much! You hit my cousin first, and now you kicked her. Do you know how long you'll be locked up by the patrol team!" Lu Jiajun shouted fiercely, his teeth clenched like a hungry wolf.

But this appearance made Su Nantian feel like a dog in a corner, and the threats Lu Jiajun spoke were even less significant to Su Nantian.

Earlier, Su Nantian had cured the illness of Lin's old man and Gao's eldest daughter in the city, which was already known in the medical field of Fengcheng. However, because Su Nantian had deliberately kept it secret, only the top-level people could know about this.

Unluckily, Lu Jiajun was one of these small fry.

Plus, the patrol team that feared Su Nantian would make such threats even less significant. It was likely that after Lu Jiajun brought Su Nantian there, he would be locked up by the patrol team.

Su Nantian remained expressionless and picked up a towel to wipe his shiny shoes, though there was no dust. But because of the kick he had given Lu Xiaoxu, he couldn't help but brush it.

This arrogant appearance made Lu Jiajun and Lu Xiaoxu even more angry, both supporting each other to get up from the floor. Lu Xiaoxu cried and sobbed, while Lu Jiajun helped her up and said: "Since you're so ungrateful, don't blame us for being harsh. If the old man is affected by you and loses his life, don't regret it."

Su Nantian prodded his ear with a finger and ignored Lu Jiajun's words, showing no fear at all. Su Nantian coldly said: "You two really are the same."

"What a shameless pair. How many patients and families have you harmed in this hospital?"

Su Nantian's words were like a thunderclap, making Lu Jiajun and Lu Xiaoxu both stunned. Then Lu Xiaoxu cried even more pitifully.

"How could you say that about me? I look so good, who deserves me? I originally wanted to be friends with you. What did you do to me!" As if Su Nantian had betrayed her, Lu Xiaoxu's eyes carried a strange look of a forsaken woman. Su Nantian's lips twitched slightly.

Lu Jiajun, however, felt a bit guilty and turned his eyes around, pretending to be calm: "Plus this time's defamation. If I report it to the hospital director, when my friend from the patrol team comes over, you'll definitely have a hard time."

"Oh? If that's the case, why don't you report it to your hospital director right now? I'd like to see if this hospital's director is also as disgusting as you two. If so, maybe this hospital doesn't need to be open anymore."

Su Nantian's confident words made Lu Jiajun a bit nervous, but he quickly dialed the hospital director Zhou Qing's phone.

"Hello, Director Zhou? It's me, Xiaolu! Well, there is a patient's family who is unreasonable and even hit the nurse..."
