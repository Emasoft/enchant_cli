“Hey Long Ge, what method is this?” A Chuan asked eagerly, his face filled with excitement and curiosity.

“Just wait and see,” Long Ge said ominously, then beckoned A Chuan closer. He whispered something into his ear.

After hearing Long Ge’s words, A Chuan looked enlightened and eager: “Heh! It really is you, Long Ge. You know how to teach these lowlifes a lesson!”

The villagers didn’t hear what they were discussing, but seeing the two men’s predatory expressions, their unease deepened. Each villager felt as if they were haunted by demons, their spines icy and palms damp with sweat.

“Village headman, what are they talking about?” The villagers asked the village headman, desperate for answers or reassurance.

But the village headman had no words to comfort them, only a troubled expression.

“Where is Wang Li? Why hasn’t he shown up when he heard the commotion?” Another villager wondered aloud.

“Don’t you remember? Hu Zi suddenly fell ill, so Wang Li took him to the hospital. He probably hasn’t returned yet,” another voice whispered.

Thus, the villagers didn’t blame Su Nantian. Instead, they were relieved he had escaped this danger.

Chapter 824: Deceit and Schemes

“Exactly! If Wang Li had heard the commotion, he definitely wouldn’t have stood by. He’d never let us down!” Another villager nodded in agreement, knowing Su Nantian’s strength and his past punishment of Ahao. They believed if he were here, he would protect them from these bandits.

But their anxiety was in vain. Su Nantian had no idea of the situation and couldn’t return to save them.

“Hmph!” Long Ge sneered, then signaled his men to bind the villagers and hang them in the grove. He intended to torment them cruelly, not allowing any comfort.

Long Ge didn’t just tie their hands; he bound their wrists tightly with ropes, leaving them dangling. This caused unbearable pain. Soon the villagers felt numbness in their hands and couldn’t touch the ground.

This despair engulfed them like waves. To add to their suffering, Long Ge’s men plugged the villagers’ mouths so they couldn’t scream. They could only endure in silence.

Even Xiao Chen and another villager, who had been shot, were bound with their hands tied and feet crushed under Long Ge’s men. Their wounds hadn’t been treated, blood still flowing, but no one noticed or cared.

The villagers prayed for Su Nantian’s return. He was their savior.

“Hmph! It really is you, Long Ge. Only you could come up with such a brilliant plan!” A Chuan praised again.

He knew binding the villagers saved their bullets and taught them a lesson. It also spared their lives to threaten Su Nantian—brilliant.

A Chuan hadn’t thought of this, so he genuinely admired Long Ge.

“Haha.” Long Ge chuckled self-satisfactorily. “A Chuan, now isn’t the time to talk. Su Nantian might appear anytime. We must stay alert.”

After saying this, Long Ge took his gun and scanned the surroundings vigilantly. He was ready to catch Su Nantian the moment he showed up, then deliver him to Hongye for interrogation.

They could complete their mission perfectly and earn Hongye’s praise. All they needed was to wait here for Su Nantian to walk into their trap.

As for the villagers? They were just a game Long Ge played while waiting for Su Nantian.

Watching Long Ge’s men cruelly bind the villagers, Ahao felt a sigh of relief. He was grateful he hadn’t opposed them; otherwise, he might be hanging there now.

Thinking of this, Ahao pressed his hand to his chest as if calming his fear. He didn’t care anymore—just being safe was enough.

Moreover, Ahao kept thinking: since Long Ge’s men were so ruthless, they must have a plan to teach the villagers a lesson. And since they came prepared, they surely had strategies against Su Nantian.

This time he’d see Su Nantian fall!

After thinking this through, Ahao’s tension eased. What could be more entertaining than watching his enemy suffer?

Once he’d made up his mind, Ahao just needed to wait patiently for Su Nantian to be thoroughly beaten.

While they were gloating over the villagers, Su Nantian had taken Hu Zi to the town hospital. After confirming he was okay, he returned to the fishing village.

Su Nantian had just come back from the hospital and was unaware of what happened. He hadn’t known about the situation in the fishing village.

But as he reached the village entrance, he heard a commotion. He paused in confusion: why were the villagers making noise at night? Were they all sleepless?

When he saw what was happening, his confusion turned to anger—uncontrollable and unbearable.

“Damn it!” Su Nantian cursed, quickening his pace toward the commotion. He saw the villagers bound with ropes and hanging from trees, looking pitiful.

Seeing this, Su Nantian lost his composure. He wondered who had done such a despicable thing to target the villagers.

After thinking this through, he hurried forward to free them.

“Long Ge! Look over there!” A Chuan heard footsteps and tapped Long Ge’s shoulder, informing him of the movement.

Long Ge immediately followed A Chuan’s gaze and saw a figure approaching swiftly. The speed was like a ghost, not resembling an ordinary person.

But since there were no lights, they couldn’t see who it was clearly.

“Is this you who tied them up?” Su Nantian stopped, his eyes cold. He asked sharply, voice laced with anger and indifference.

“Long Ge is him! It’s this Wang Li!” Ahao shouted, recognizing Su Nantian. He felt anger at what Su Nantian had done to him before.

Chapter 825: Cleaning Up

“It’s this man!” Ahao added loudly, hoping Long Ge would teach Su Nantian a lesson and make him never be so arrogant again.

After saying this, Ahao anxiously watched Long Ge, hoping they’d act quickly against Su Nantian.

Before Long Ge could answer Ahao, Su Nantian heard the familiar voice and saw his face. He let out a cold laugh: “Hmph, it’s you again.”

Su Nantian spoke simply but with a tone that made Ahao sense danger.

“What if it is?” Ahao thought he had Long Ge’s support and that they had such a powerful person with them. He wouldn’t be defeated by Su Nantian alone.

After thinking this through, Ahao felt less fear. He seemed to gain some confidence and defiantly looked at Su Nantian, no longer afraid.

When Ahao heard this, Su Nantian smiled coldly. He thought Ahao had found a strong ally and dared to speak so arrogantly, with such boldness.

Thinking this through, Su Nantian found it even more amusing.

“Do you remember what I told you before?” Su Nantian asked Ahao mockingly.

When Ahao heard this tone, he instinctively shrank back, his face pale. He certainly remembered Su Nantian’s previous threat—saying he’d kill him if he ever set foot in the fishing village again.

But under these circumstances, admitting it would be suicide. He couldn’t afford that!

“I don’t remember. I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Ahao’s face changed again, trying to stay calm. He thought this could help him deny it.

Su Nantian didn’t argue but chuckled, his laughter meaningful. Ahao thought Su Nantian would say something, but seeing he said nothing made him even more afraid. He couldn’t figure out what Su Nantian was like or what he planned to do.

Su Nantian smiled coldly and said, “You don’t remember? Then I’ll make you remember.”

After saying this, Su Nantian’s face turned very cold.

When Ahao heard this, he immediately showed fear. Was it the meaning he thought? Did Su Nantian want to deal with him?

Ahao anxiously guessed, and the more he thought about it, the more afraid he became. He had only shrank his shoulders before, but now his whole body trembled more than when he faced Long Ge. After all, he had experienced Su Nantian’s strength and didn’t want to try it again.

The more he thought about this, the more he wanted to retreat, as if that could avoid Su Nantian’s attack. But he didn’t realize this was like covering one's ears while stealing.

“Li Ge, you’re here!” Xiao Chen struggled to open his eyes and said this with difficulty. He had lost too much blood and was in pain, so he felt drowsy and his mind was hazy. He couldn’t tell what was happening.

Only when he heard Su Nantian’s familiar voice did he regain some awareness.

When Su Nantian heard Xiao Chen’s voice, he looked down and saw Xiao Chen being crushed under them. When Su Nantian saw the villagers hanging from trees, he was already furious. Now seeing Xiao Chen injured made him feel even worse.

He longed to kill them all right now!

No need to ask. Su Nantian knew it was these people who did this.

He hadn’t expected Ahao to be so bold. He had warned him several times and threatened him, but he still dared to touch Su Nantian’s forbidden area. If so, Su Nantian wouldn’t give Ahao any more chances.

If even breaking his arm hadn’t made him realize, Su Nantian wouldn’t show any mercy anymore.

Ahao felt the change in Su Nantian’s aura, sensing the danger in the air. He had a strong sense of unease, realizing Su Nantian wouldn’t let him go.

“Li Ge, you’re here! These people are after me. You must protect me!” Ahao trembled and seemed desperate, forgetting that Long Ge wasn’t a kind person. He was urging them to protect him.

Ahao was only worried Su Nantian would be angry and punish him. So he immediately thought of self-preservation, forgetting everything else.

But Long Ge and A Chuan were eager to find Su Nantian, so they had no time to argue with Ahao.

A Chuan took out his phone to check the photos and carefully examined Su Nantian’s face before whispering to Long Ge, “Li Ge, it’s him. No mistake.”

Although the surveillance photo was blurry, they had accurately recognized Su Nantian.

“Are you looking for me?” After hearing Long Ge and A Chuan’s conversation, Su Nantian had some guesses. He asked softly, his face flashing a meaningful expression.

Did these people come to find him? Otherwise, how did they have his photo?

Thinking this through, Su Nantian admired Uncle Wang’s foresight. When he was rescued by Uncle Wang, he found a face mask on his face. He had been wondering why he was wearing such a fake face.

After that, Su Nantian didn’t plan to use the mask anymore and wanted to live with his real face. But Uncle Wang advised him then.

Chapter 826: Starting the Lesson

Uncle Wang said since they weren’t sure of Su Nantian’s identity, it was better to keep the previous fake face. If so, maybe someone outside would find him and locate him.

Because of Uncle Wang’s advice, Su Nantian made another face mask identical to the previous one and continued living in the fishing village with it.

Unexpectedly, Uncle Wang was right. These people indeed recognized his previous self. They had already come with his photo to find him.

Although Su Nantian’s memory was starting to blur and he didn’t remember much of the past, his intelligence was still sharp. He saw their attitude and knew they were not here to find him.

After saying this, Su Nantian took A Chuan’s phone and looked at the photo. He recognized it was himself.

Seeing this, Su Nantian understood these people had come to find him. And they were from the enemy side.

“Hey! What are you doing?” A Chuan didn’t want to talk to Su Nantian at first, but he hadn’t expected Su Nantian’s speed. He immediately grabbed his phone.

This was so fast that A Chuan didn’t react in time, and the phone was already in Su Nantian’s hand.

After realizing this, A Chuan quickly tried to get his phone back. But once it was in Su Nantian’s hand, he couldn’t take it back.

“Give it back to me!” A Chuan was angry and embarrassed. He couldn’t bear the humiliation of being beaten by Su Nantian in front of so many people.

After thinking this through, A Chuan’s face was even more unpleasant. His tone was very dissatisfied, wanting to get his phone back quickly.

“You haven’t answered my question yet,” Su Nantian wouldn’t let A Chuan have his way. He hadn’t gotten the answer he wanted, so naturally wouldn’t satisfy A Chuan’s request.

“Who sent you to find me?” Su Nantian tightly held the phone and asked A Chuan. His tone was a bit confused but clearly commanding.

A Chuan had no good impression of Su Nantian after being robbed of his phone and losing face in front of so many people. Now when Su Nantian asked him this, how could he tell him the answer?

A Chuan just rolled his eyes and deliberately provoked Su Nantian: “If you’re so smart, figure it out yourself!”

“Okay, then try to take back your phone by force!” Su Nantian didn’t get angry or annoyed at A Chuan’s words. Instead, he replied to him directly. This made A Chuan even more embarrassed.

It was like hitting a cotton ball—no power and no way to vent, making A Chuan even more frustrated.

“Li Ge!” Xiao Chen, who was being crushed under them, spoke again. He weakly begged Su Nantian for help: “Su Nantian, you must hurry and save us!”

“Don’t worry. I’m here,” Su Nantian answered Xiao Chen immediately. Seeing that Xiao Chen was injured, his face changed again: “You’re hurt!”

Su Nantian had decided to help Xiao Chen and the villagers of the fishing village. He would never let these outsiders bully them.

But now, seeing Xiao Chen was injured and noticing the bloodstain on the ground, he was thoroughly enraged.

They shouldn’t have dared to provoke the people of the fishing village or him!

Su Nantian’s fists clenched. In this moment, he crushed A Chuan’s phone with such incredible strength.

This action shocked A Chuan and Long Ge. They had come to deal with Su Nantian, but now they instinctively took a step back and dared not look at Su Nantian directly.

“Li Ge.” A Chuan was the first to recover. He realized their reaction and felt a bit embarrassed, so he quickly spoke up to remind Long Ge.

Long Ge also heard A Chuan’s voice and quickly regained his composure. Thinking about their previous encounter with Su Nantian, he felt a bit embarrassed.

“Su Nantian, do you know what you’ve done?” Long Ge started scolding Su Nantian now, trying to regain the face they had lost. It seemed this would make them feel less embarrassed.

“We’re just following orders!” Long Ge added, clearly lacking confidence.

“If you’re smart, surrender and let us take you back!” Long Ge threatened Su Nantian. At this point, his fear of Su Nantian had disappeared, and he was filled with excitement.

They had planned to come and confirm whether this person was who they were looking for. They also wanted to see if he was Hongye’s target. Unexpectedly, they had found him.

Thinking about how quickly they could deal with Su Nantian and complete Hongye’s mission, Long Ge was definitely happy.

Even A Chuan standing by Long Ge felt a strange excitement. He thought they could deal with Su Nantian, and Hongye would definitely praise them. Then they could show off in front of other brothers.

“Long Ge is right. If you’re smart, surrender and don’t try any tricks!” A Chuan echoed Long Ge’s words and spoke arrogantly. After saying this, he snapped his fingers to signal the men behind him.

“We all know you’re strong. But even if you are, you only have two hands and two feet. You can dodge our attacks, but can you guarantee saving all of them?” A Chuan said this while looking at Su Nantian arrogantly, as if he was certain Su Nantian wouldn’t dare to fight back.

At this moment, the others also raised their guns and aimed at the villagers hanging from the trees. They would kill one of them immediately if Su Nantian made any move.

And this was random selection, giving no time for Su Nantian to hesitate.

Chapter 827: Clearing Obstacles

“Can you do that?” A Chuan asked arrogantly, as if he was certain Su Nantian wouldn’t dare to do anything about it.

Especially thinking about how he could control Su Nantian, A Chuan felt very satisfied. His previous long journey and the bad mood caused by these ignorant villagers were instantly brightened.

Hearing Long Ge and A Chuan’s threats, the other villagers changed their faces. Because their mouths were covered, they could only make muffled sounds. But they didn’t give up and kept struggling to free themselves, not wanting to be used as leverage against Su Nantian.

“Don’t mind us!” Xiao Chen weakly said, not expecting them to be so cunning.

“Li Ge, remember to avenge us!” He didn’t care if he died. As long as Su Nantian would avenge him, it was enough! He’d even drag these demons to hell with him.

“Damn it! Shut up!” Long Ge and A Chuan were relying on Xiao Chen and these villagers to threaten Su Nantian. Now seeing the villagers and Xiao Chen were willing to face death, they became anxious immediately.

These were their precious hostages. If they couldn’t be used to control Su Nantian, how could they restrain him?

After thinking this through, A Chuan kicked Xiao Chen heavily. Although he didn’t hit the wound, Xiao Chen was already very weak. This action was like adding insult to injury.

“Ah!” Xiao Chen screamed, his face more painful. Seeing this, Su Nantian changed his expression.

But when Long Ge and A Chuan saw Su Nantian’s change of expression, they felt excited. They knew the more Su Nantian cared about Xiao Chen, the more effective these hostages were. They could use them to force Su Nantian.

After thinking this through, Long Ge and A Chuan felt these hostages were more useful. They wouldn’t let Su Nantian abandon them or allow Xiao Chen to persuade him.

Long Ge and A Chuan exchanged a glance, preparing to give Xiao Chen more punishment to torment Su Nantian and warn him not to act recklessly.

“Stop!” Su Nantian saw Xiao Chen, who already had wounds, being beaten. He was even more angry.

Especially seeing Xiao Chen’s painful expression, Su Nantian longed to kill these people immediately.

But they didn’t care about Su Nantian’s words and felt excited by his anger. The more angry Su Nantian was, the more he cared about Xiao Chen, and their chances increased.

After thinking this through, Long Ge and A Chuan felt they had finally seized Su Nantian’s weakness and controlled his lifeline.

They also believed Su Nantian couldn’t fight back anymore.

“Ah!” Xiao Chen screamed again after being beaten. But he quickly spoke, still insisting that Su Nantian not mind them and to kill these people quickly and save the others.

“Li Ge, you don’t need to mind us. These are demons, beasts without humanity. Even if you listen to them now, they won’t do what they said. You don’t need to care about their…” This was Xiao Chen’s inner thought. He already knew that people like these, even if they used them to threaten Su Nantian now, would eventually eliminate the villagers of the fishing village to cover up and kill them.

So it was better for Su Nantian to abandon them and directly attack these people. That way, he could at least save Su Nantian and sacrifice a few to protect the villagers of the fishing village.

After thinking this through, Xiao Chen loudly told Su Nantian: “Li Ge, you really don’t need to mind us. Kill them quickly and save the others!”

Although Long Ge and A Chuan had guns, they weren’t more than ten people. They had already seen Su Nantian’s abilities and knew he could defeat them all.

Although some villagers would be killed in retaliation, they had to choose this method. It was the best plan they could think of now.

“Damn it! Shut up! I told you to shut up!” A Chuan was furious because Xiao Chen kept persuading Su Nantian not to mind them and disrupting their plan. He cursed, then raised his foot to kick Xiao Chen again, trying to make him shut up and not interfere with their plan.

“ I’ll kill them and save you all,” But before A Chuan could kick Xiao Chen, Su Nantian spoke. He said this calmly, but the words carried his determination.

These few words made it clear he meant what he said. It also excited people, as Su Nantian wouldn’t say it lightly.

These words were entirely from Su Nantian’s heart and his true thoughts.

The villagers of the fishing village had been afraid, especially seeing these people with guns and looking like demons. They were no match for them.

But now, hearing Su Nantian’s words, they calmed down again. They felt they had found confidence and believed Su Nantian would save the others.

After thinking this through, everyone who had been afraid and struggled to break free now seemed resigned. Their expressions were calm, no longer the fear they had before. They seemed ready to accept death.

When Long Ge and A Chuan heard Su Nantian speak, they stopped their actions. But soon they noticed the villagers’ change and became furious again, glaring at Su Nantian.

“Such a big mouth. You say you’ll kill us and save them all?”

Chapter 828: Overestimating Oneself

Long Ge laughed coldly, mocking Su Nantian’s overconfidence.

Even though they had seen Su Nantian’s abilities in the surveillance, and how he dealt with Wu Chuan and other security guards efficiently, people were like this. Without personal experience, no matter how others said it or even if they saw it themselves, they wouldn’t believe.

So at this moment, Long Ge and A Chuan thought Su Nantian was exaggerating and pretending to be calm.

After thinking this through, Long Ge mocked Su Nantian: “Come on! Do what you can. You’re not even capable of saving yourself!”

He believed Su Nantian might save a few people, but he would soon be in trouble and unable to save others.

A Chuan also echoed Long Ge’s words, laughing and mocking Su Nantian. He clearly showed his contempt for Su Nantian: “You say you’ll save them all? We’ll shoot one of these villagers randomly. See who you can protect!”

After saying this, A Chuan actually raised his gun to shoot a villager randomly to threaten Su Nantian.

When Long Ge saw this action, he didn’t stop or prevent it. Because Long Ge and A Chuan had the same idea—they wanted Su Nantian to experience their punishment.

After all, they hadn’t killed these villagers before because of pity or mercy. It was just that Long Ge thought it would be more effective to keep them for the final kill.

Now that Su Nantian had appeared, they didn’t need to keep them. They would kill one and let Su Nantian see their strength, making him realize they weren’t joking.

At this moment, everyone held their breath, thinking Long Ge would succeed. Even Ahao, standing behind them, thought this way. They all felt Su Nantian was overconfident and pretending to be calm.

Although Ahao also disliked these villagers, he closed his eyes at this moment, unwilling to see the bloody scene.

But at this moment, their bullets didn’t hit the villagers as expected. Instead, they were stopped in mid-air by an invisible barrier and fell to the ground.

“Clack—”

The sound of the bullet hitting the ground was clear, making Long Ge and his men stare in shock.

“What’s going on?” Long Ge exclaimed in disbelief, staring at the bullet on the ground.

“This is impossible!” A Chuan, who had fired the shot, rubbed his eyes and looked at his gun. He couldn’t accept this fact.

He had aimed directly at the villagers, but the bullet fell from mid-air. It was as if an invisible hand had grabbed it and thrown it down.

After thinking this through, Long Ge and his men looked terrified. Their previous arrogance had disappeared.

Had they really underestimated Su Nantian?

Although they had seen the video, they thought Su Nantian was just an ordinary person, maybe better trained than them.

But now it seemed strange and beyond their usual limits.

“Li Ge, this….” A Chuan was startled by the bullet. He looked down at his gun instinctively.

Then he looked back at Long Ge’s direction, asking with a worried look. His heart was pounding and his face was unwell.

Had they acted recklessly and underestimated Su Nantian’s abilities?

“Just a small problem,” Long Ge, who had been shocked, quickly regained his composure. He comforted A Chuan and said.

“Continue shooting. I don’t believe this!” If it was just a coincidence, they would try again and see if it was truly the reason.

But Long Ge still didn’t believe in this. He thought there were no such strange people or magical energy in the world.

However, Long Ge would soon know what it meant to be slapped in the face and what was beyond his comprehension.

When A Chuan heard Long Ge say this, although he still felt uneasy, he leaned towards Long Ge’s opinion. He and Long Ge thought they couldn’t let Su Nantian lead them.

So A Chuan pulled the trigger again. This time he aimed at another direction, preparing to shoot again and test whether it was Su Nantian’s interference or if he had just missed.

“Hmph.”
