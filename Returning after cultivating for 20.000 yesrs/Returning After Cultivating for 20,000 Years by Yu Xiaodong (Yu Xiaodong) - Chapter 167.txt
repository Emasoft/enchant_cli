After they departed, the atmosphere here underwent a complete transformation.
Everyone had thought Su Nantian’s cold demeanor just now was terrifying enough, but they hadn’t realized that this very expression had been Su Nantian’s restrained suppression of his aura, as he stood before the villagers.
Once those people left, Su Nantian’s aura fully unleashed, as if he had become another person. His surrounding presence shifted entirely, leaving them too afraid to glance at him again.
Even a single look at him would instill an overwhelming sense of fear.
„What do you intend to do with us?“
Despite Long Ge’s vague suspicions, he still harbored a final hope that Su Nantian might spare them. Achuan and the others held their breath, anxiously watching Su Nantian.
„What do you think?“
Su Nantian let out a cold laugh. No longer expressionless, his lips curled with a mocking smile. His eyes had turned into solid ice, and every person who met his gaze felt an icy chill.
„You all like to fire guns, don’t you? You enjoy threatening these villagers, right?“
Su Nantian spoke slowly now. His hand extended outward and spread open, gesturing toward the twisted pile of firearms on the ground.
Su Nantian’s palm closed, and all the bullets inside the guns flew upward into his hand.
At this moment, Su Nantian curled his lips again, and his gaze grew even colder. He then opened his palm directly toward Long Ge and the others.
After performing this action, Su Nantian curled his lips once more.

Chapter 834: Lessons
The bullets Su Nantian had gathered in his palm suddenly seemed to awaken, each flying toward them with unstoppable speed—faster than bullets fired from a gun.
Before they could even let out a single cry of alarm, the bullets pierced their skulls and killed them instantly.
They collapsed with a thud, sending up clouds of dust. All life had been drained from them by Su Nantian.
Yet he felt no pity or mercy; he knew this was what they deserved.
He had already shown them leniency by allowing them to confess everything without further torment, killing them swiftly. This was their fortune.
After clarifying his thoughts, Su Nantian’s expression grew even more solemn. In the night’s backdrop, his aura and presence abruptly changed, as if he had become a demon preying on life. No one dared to approach him.
Though these minor pests were now dealt with, the ultimate goal remained unfulfilled. His doubts had not been fully resolved.
„Is it Hongye?“
Su Nantian spoke softly, his gaze turning even colder.
He gazed at the corpses on the ground without a single lingering glance, his eyes immediately returning to their original focus. He now knew who his next target was—this man residing in M City, Hongye.
Su Nantian intended to uncover who he was, why he had come after him, and why so many people had been sent to find him.
Perhaps once he found Hongye, it would be the moment he unraveled the mystery of his own origins.
After clarifying his next move, Su Nantian wasted no time. He quickly turned around and prepared to check on the injuries of Xiao Chen and his group. Once he had treated them, he would set out to find Hongye.
„Lige! You’re back!“
When Xiao Ling and the others saw Su Nantian return, they greeted him joyfully. No one dared to ask about the fate of those people in an awkward manner, nor did anyone say anything inappropriate.
They all welcomed Su Nantian joyfully, knowing his return was their savior.
Then Su Nantian treated Xiao Chen and the others.
„Lige, I’m fine. Go check on Azu first!“
Xiao Chen had already stopped the bleeding slightly, lying in bed with his sister’s careful care. His complexion had eased, and he had regained some strength.
At this moment, he could still offer Su Nantian a gentle smile.
„I’m fine, Lige. Go check on Azu first!“
Xiao Chen added another sentence, still maintaining the same friendly demeanor he had always shown Su Nantian. There was no resentment toward Su Nantian, as if his wounds had not been caused by him.
At this moment, Xiao Chen also felt that without Su Nantian, their small fishing village would have already been seized by those bullies. The villagers could not have lived such a carefree and happy life.
One must never forget their roots, and Xiao Chen was someone who repaid kindness with gratitude. He would not blame this incident on Su Nantian but instead feel even more grateful toward him.
Xiao Chen also did not ask Su Nantian why he had known those people outside, nor did he inquire how Su Nantian had dealt with Long Ge and Achuan.
What they focused on now was only Su Nantian’s life in the small fishing village.
Azu waved his hand weakly, „Lige, I’m fine. Check on Xiao Chen first; he’s more seriously injured. I was just hit in the leg, but he was struck in the abdomen.“
At this moment, both Azu and Xiao Chen were politely deferring to each other, showing no selfishness. They were the purest people Su Nantian had ever met.
Although Azu was a few years older than Su Nantian, they all willingly addressed him as „Lige“ (Big Brother), solely because of the benefits Su Nantian had brought them and his selfless help.
Everyone genuinely respected Su Nantian.
„Alright, both of you lie down.“
Seeing them constantly deferring to each other and worrying about each other’s injuries, Su Nantian sighed with a mix of amusement and helplessness. He ordered them both to lie down in bed, deciding who to treat first after examining their wounds.
Su Nantian frowned upon Xiao Chen’s bleeding wound, feeling some resentment for not having been more ruthless and given them a swift death.
„Xiao Chen’s injury is more severe; I’ll remove the bullet first. Azu, you’ll have to wait a moment.“
Su Nantian quickly made his decision. After examining their wounds, he realized Xiao Chen’s condition was indeed dangerous. If not for his luck and the fact that his internal organs were unharmed, he would have already died before Su Nantian returned.
Xiao Chen, hearing this, knew Su Nantian had made up his mind and would not change it easily. He nodded obediently, cooperating without saying anything inappropriate.
„It’s all right now.“
After Su Nantian removed the bullets, he sprinkled medicinal herbs to stop the bleeding and bandaged them. He then comforted those around him who were worried.
So much had happened that night. The villagers who had been threatened by Long Ge and the others, as well as those who had come to inquire, were all gathered here, anxiously watching Su Nantian.
They had been in high tension and concern for the villagers’ injuries, but now that Su Nantian had personally confirmed they were fine and only needed rest, everyone let out a sigh of relief.
However, soon after, they all stared intently at Su Nantian. The elderly village head especially hesitated, his face showing reluctance.
Wang Shu had also arrived in a hurry, accompanied by A Wang.
They had gone to sleep early and hadn’t heard the commotion outside, so they hadn’t gone out to mingle. It was sheer luck that they had avoided this disaster.
But upon hearing about the massive event in the village, Wang Shu, who held a status akin to a clan elder in the small fishing village, immediately rushed over.
When he saw everyone watching Su Nantian, Wang Shu’s heart gave a jolt. He knew he could no longer keep it a secret.
He understood the village head’s confusion and saw the elderly man’s reluctant expression. So Wang Shu took the initiative to speak.

Chapter 835: The Truth
„Let me tell you.“
Wang Shu spoke, breaking the silence.
His face was expressionless as he said this. His lips moved several times, as if hesitating how to phrase his words.
„I’m sorry everyone. Actually, Wang Li is not my nephew. He’s not someone who came from outside to seek refuge with me. He was a person I and A Wang rescued while fishing unintentionally. I feared you wouldn’t accept him, so I gave him a false identity. I’m sorry.“
After saying this, Wang Shu bowed to the villagers, expressing his guilt.
He had always known Su Nantian’s abilities and realized he was no ordinary person.
He also knew Su Nantian had been injured in the head and thrown into a river, which confirmed he was no ordinary person.
He had anticipated this day long ago and felt guilty for involving the villagers.
Although everything had turned out well, he still felt deep self-reproach. Su Nantian was the one he had rescued, and he had known Su Nantian’s identity was unusual. Yet he still took on this risk.
Therefore, when trouble arose, he felt it was his duty to be the first one blamed.
„Wang Shu, you…“
The villagers, upon hearing Wang Shu’s words, blinked in shock, unable to accept this truth.
But they soon wore a troubled expression, unsure whether to blame Wang Shu or say it wasn’t his fault. After all, they had been terrified tonight.
„This is my mistake. I concealed the truth from everyone, and it has nothing to do with Wang Shu. If you want to blame anyone, blame me alone.“
At this moment, Su Nantian stepped forward and blocked Wang Shu and A Wang behind him. He directly took responsibility for everything.
This was indeed his problem. Though he didn’t know who he had been before, those people who came tonight clearly mentioned his name and targeted him. The villagers of the small fishing village were entirely caught in this.
This apology was well-earned by Su Nantian.
„This…“
The villagers of the small fishing village looked at each other in bewilderment, unsure what to say.
They were deeply moved by Su Nantian’s willingness to take responsibility and his direct admission of guilt. Yet, thinking about the people who had come tonight, they still felt Su Nantian’s identity was a mystery and dangerous.
Humans are naturally self-preservationists, avoiding danger instinctively.
But the villagers of the small fishing village were simple and kind. They remembered all they had received from Su Nantian, as well as how he had saved them multiple times. Especially during the incident with the bullies, they owed him a debt.
At this moment, they didn’t know what to do.
„We don’t mean to blame you.“
The elderly village head, supported by others, stepped forward tremblingly. He gazed at Su Nantian, his face lined with age but his eyes clear and sharp.
„You know, we are old and young, ordinary people who can’t handle these kinds of people.“
The elderly village head sighed helplessly after saying this.
This wasn’t to expel Su Nantian but to inform him of their current situation, letting him clearly consider it.
„No! Elder Village Head!“
Before Su Nantian could respond, Xiao Chen rushed forward anxiously: „Lige, it’s not right. From now on, you should call him Tian Ge!“
After saying this, Xiao Chen anxiously looked at the elderly village head: „Elder Village Head, Tian Ge has helped us so much. Even if there’s no merit, he has hardship. And those people tonight were clearly their problem, what does it have to do with Tian Ge? Please don’t blame Tian Ge!“
Others who had benefited from Su Nantian, including those he had treated and taught about herbs, also spoke up in agreement: „Yes! Elder Village Head!“
„Thanks to Nan Tian, we have this good life.“
The villagers spoke up in agreement, praising Su Nantian.
After all, those villains had been dealt with by Su Nantian tonight. As long as he was there, they wouldn’t dare to come back. It should be fine.
They were simple people; even after being frightened, they began to accept Su Nantian once things were safe. At this moment, they all spoke in his favor, urging the elderly village head to let him stay.
„Ah! I didn’t mean to drive him away…“
Seeing the villagers’ anxious faces, the elderly village head knew they had misunderstood his intention. He sighed and continued: „I meant…“
„Elder Village Head, I understand your meaning.“
Before the elderly village head could finish his words, Su Nantian quickly interjected: „Since these people were brought by me, it’s my responsibility to resolve them.“
Su Nantian thought long-term. Unlike the villagers who believed that after dealing with Long Ge and Achuan tonight, everything would be safe.
Su Nantian clearly knew that this matter involved Hongye. If so, it meant more people would come after them.
As long as the person behind was not resolved, the villagers of the small fishing village would never have peace.
„Elder Village Head, rest assured.“
After clarifying his thoughts, Su Nantian slightly subdued his expression and promised the elderly village head: „Even if you don’t say it, I had this plan. Besides, I can’t let my problems involve you.“
„But don’t worry; I’ll resolve this matter and ensure they won’t come back to the small fishing village or disturb your peace.“
Su Nantian added another assurance, then comforted everyone further.
The villagers, hearing this, knew his mind was made up and that even the elderly village head supported his actions. They could only remain silent and stop trying to persuade Su Nantian.
They spoke for a while longer, then Su Nantian and Wang Shu went home together.
„Nan Tian.“
Wang Shu walked silently with Su Nantian toward home. After walking halfway, Wang Shu suddenly spoke again. He seemed to have thought it over carefully and asked with a tense expression.
Su Nantian smiled: „I was wondering when you’d call me.“
After such a big event, he must have had questions.
So Su Nantian had been quietly calculating the entire time, wondering how long Wang Shu would hold back before asking him. He hadn’t expected it to take almost the entire journey.
A Wang was already asleep, and Su Nantian carried him on his back. He looked at Wang Shu: „Wang Shu, what do you want to ask?“
Su Nantian got straight to the point.
He knew Wang Shu was direct and didn’t want to beat around the bush.
Wang Shu, having guessed his thoughts, showed no hesitation and asked directly: „Have you still not regained any memories?“
Those people who had come tonight should have triggered Su Nantian, possibly helping him remember something.
„No.“
Su Nantian shook his head. In fact, he was also very anxious.
He had originally thought that Long Ge and the so-called Hongye mentioned by them would trigger something in him, helping him remember past events.
But it turned out there was no resonance at all; his mind had no fragments of memory.
„That’s strange.“
Wang Shu, hearing Su Nantian’s answer, was also puzzled. He pondered for a moment and his expression grew more solemn.
He knew he was just an ordinary villager, but he had promised Su Nantian before. When he went out, he would help look for information about him.
Wang Shu hadn’t deceived Su Nantian. Every time he went out to sell fish or herbs, he would casually ask people about Su Nantian.
But due to his status, he could only reach ordinary citizens. Even if he asked every time, he couldn’t get any information about Su Nantian from them. These people didn’t even know who Su Nantian was.
So Wang Shu always returned empty-handed, disappointed and without any clues.
Wang Shu now subdued his expression further, becoming more solemn.
„What are you going to do now? You said you would reassure the villagers, but what is your decision?“
Wang Shu asked again and looked up at Su Nantian.
„I found a person from them, and now I plan to find him to see if he can provide any clues.“
When Su Nantian heard Wang Shu’s question, he didn’t hide anything and directly told him about what he had extracted from Long Ge.
„Since they came looking for me and said Hongye has a significant background, he must know something. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have sent so many people to find me in such a big way.“
Su Nantian analyzed this, recalling that Long Ge had said it wasn’t just them searching for him but many people spread out. The more people involved, the more important he was.
This also indicated that those people knew about him.
„I see.“
After hearing Su Nantian’s analysis, Wang Shu nodded slowly, understanding his intention.
„Be careful and stay safe.“
Wang Shu added another sentence: „Remember not to rush. If you can’t get any information from them, come back. The small fishing village will always be your support.“
At first, it was out of kindness that he had saved Su Nantian. But after spending time with him, Wang Shu had already regarded Su Nantian as his younger brother and truly cared for him.
Especially since A Wang, the child, was always clinging to Su Nantian and called him „Uncle“ constantly.
The villagers had also become accustomed to Su Nantian’s presence and naturally welcomed him to stay.
So Wang Shu said this not out of his own intention but because he had seen the villagers’ true feelings. He believed that if Su Nantian returned, they would welcome him with open arms.
„Hmm.“
Su Nantian was slightly taken aback, not expecting Wang Shu to say this.
But soon after, a flicker of emotion passed through his eyes. Su Nantian nodded to Wang Shu: „I know.“
He didn’t say thanks or other expressions of gratitude but simply said he knew.
This also meant that Su Nantian considered Wang Shu and the others as family, needing no formalities.
The more so, he needed to thoroughly investigate who these people were and protect the small fishing village from being harmed.
Wang Shu now gazed at Su Nantian deeply, but he didn’t say anything more.
Because Wang Shu knew that even if he said this, he knew Su Nantian was a dragon soaring through the nine heavens and would never stay in such a small village.
Even though they accepted Su Nantian and welcomed him to stay, Su Nantian would one day take flight.
He was not a creature of the pond and wouldn’t stay here for long.
But since that day hadn’t come yet, he didn’t need to be melancholic or worry unnecessarily. It was better to cherish the present time.
After thinking this through, Wang Shu subdued his expression and said nothing more.
He raised his hand to pat Su Nantian’s shoulder: „I believe you will succeed.“
This was Wang Shu’s heartfelt words, truly sincere.
„Hmm.“
Su Nantian let out a light laugh and nodded to Wang Shu: „Wait for my good news.“

Chapter 836: Measures
This matter must succeed, or it would be a failure. He would definitely protect the villagers of the small fishing village and repay their trust and kindness.
At this moment, Su Nantian had already decided to set out for M City to find Hongye and personally see what kind of person he was.
Of course, the most important thing was to extract the information he needed from Hongye.
As he thought about this, Su Nantian couldn’t help but look up at the moon hanging in the sky. He seemed to want to memorize every scene of the small fishing village during this time.
He didn’t know if he would have another chance to appreciate these views again in the future.
Meanwhile, Hongye in M City had also started paying attention to this matter.
„Have there been any updates yet?“
He sat on a high seat, frowning with dissatisfaction.
A week had passed, and these people still hadn’t given any feedback. Had Su Nantian truly hidden so well that even his claws couldn’t find him?
Thinking about this, Hongye felt more dissatisfaction and was even more annoyed with their efficiency.
They were all just eating dry rice, useless people who couldn’t do anything. It was truly annoying!
Hongye had originally thought he could find Su Nantian quickly and then use Xu Xiangning as a pawn to successfully establish contact with the Xu family. He could also gain favor with the Xu family members.
After all, the Xu family was the true aristocratic clan in M City with hundreds of years of foundation. After experiencing countless storms, they still stood firm.
Although Hongye’s current status was considerable, he was still confined to operating in the shadows and hadn’t yet secured a stable position.
This was also why Hongye had submitted to Xu Xiangning and spent so much time maneuvering with her.
Otherwise, given Hongye’s status and position, why would he waste time on Xu Xiangning, a middle-aged woman? There were plenty of young and beautiful women in the world.
On the contrary, there were many.
But he hadn’t expected that something so simple would take this long without any progress.
He had sent people out one after another, and so many of them.
But what was the result? They all seemed to be eating dry rice, with no feedback at all.
They had even come up with various excuses and wasted a lot of funds.
Hongye didn’t know if they were deliberately provoking him, but this made his face dark and gloomy as if ink could drip from it at any moment.
The more he thought about this, the angrier and dissatisfied he became.
He had hired these people to do a job, not to raise them as lazy eaters.
If they couldn’t satisfy him, Hongye wouldn’t mind giving them a lesson to make it clear that offending him was not a good omen.
„Master Hong, our people have all been dispatched to search for him. However, this involves five rivers and many villages nearby. Even if they wanted to find him, it would take some time.“
When the assistant heard Hongye’s words, he immediately lowered his head and quickly explained: „But I will urge them to speed up. Master Hong, don’t be anxious.“
He said all this to prevent Hongye from being too impatient and rushing them. After all, it was a massive effort requiring considerable manpower and resources to find him; it couldn’t be done in one day.
„Time, time! How many times have I given you?“
Hongye furrowed his brows and scolded the assistant loudly: „But what have you done? Are you relying on my kindness to be lazy and indifferent? Or do you think I’ve retired and can’t touch you anymore?“
At this moment, Hongye let out a cold laugh. His eyes were fierce and cruel, like a leopard or hyena eyeing its prey and ready to tear it apart.
What kind of excuse was this?
He had entrusted them with the task, and if they were incapable, that was one thing. Now they were coming up with excuses to cover themselves. If it was truly so difficult, why had they made such bold promises and sworn to do it?
Moreover, Hongye felt he had delayed too long. If he didn’t give Xu Xiangning some feedback soon, he might lose this good pawn.
Hongye was not a foolish person like Xu Xiangning.
Xu Xiangning thought she had done everything perfectly and could use herself to obtain information from the outside. But Hongye was very clear that Xu Xiangning’s level could not escape the eyes of the Xu family.
They hadn’t interfered or taken action because they didn’t take her seriously. That was why Hongye could exploit the gap and infiltrate, winning Xu Xiangning’s heart to use the Xu family’s power.
So now Hongye was anxious. He feared that if he continued to delay, Xu Xiangning would become impatient. After all, these methods required a balance of tension and relaxation, but if he kept delaying and being careless, the feedback would definitely not be what he wanted.
„I don’t care about your excuses. In any case, I’ll give you three more days. If they still have no clues, send them all away!“
After thinking it through, Hongye roared again and directly scolded the assistant. After saying this, he coldly glanced at the assistant, as if recalling something and his eyes carried a clear mockery: „As for you, if the people below don’t fulfill my requirements, you’ll be sent away too!“
The assistant had been by Hongye’s side for years. He naturally knew Hongye’s personality and was very clear that Hongye didn’t have a good heart. If he told him to leave, it wasn’t really sending him away; if that were the case, the assistant might have felt a little relief.
He had learned so many secrets from Hongye and knew about the various mysteries of his operations. If he was sent away, naturally, he would have to leave his life behind with the Hong family.
This “send them away” from Hongye actually meant to kill him!
„Master Hong, I will do my best! I won’t disappoint Master Hong!“
The assistant was startled and trembled all over. Thinking about Hongye’s bad temper, he was extremely nervous. At this moment, the assistant didn’t dare to delay or procrastinate anymore.
He had indeed made excuses earlier, but after being frightened by Hongye, he no longer dared to have such thoughts.
„Master Hong, I will urge them and make sure they complete your request as soon as possible. I won’t delay at all.“

Chapter 837: Calculated Moves
„Master Hong, please rest assured.“
At this point, the assistant quickly lowered his head again and dared not look at Hongye’s face: „I will definitely do it as soon as possible.“
Although Hongye was still angry about their efficiency, seeing the assistant’s cooperation made him slightly ease up. His expression wasn’t as grim as before, and his eyes softened a little, no longer like those of a hunter eyeing its prey.
Noticing Hongye’s gaze beginning to relax, the assistant gradually relaxed his shoulders and wasn’t as tense anymore.
He was truly afraid that one careless move would provoke Hongye, who would then kill him on the spot.
„Alright, go away.“
Seeing the assistant’s cowering demeanor and his cowardly nature, Hongye felt a bit disgusted. He then waved his hand and directly ordered the assistant to leave first.
As the assistant reached the door, Hongye suddenly spoke again: „Remember, it’s three days. If in these three days…“
At this point, Hongye paused for a moment and waited until the assistant turned back in anxiety. Then Hongye took out his pistol from the drawer and placed it on the table with a „clack.“
„Clack—“
The gun fell onto the desk. Hongye’s expression remained calm, with no suspicious signs.
Hongye didn’t say anything more at this moment, but his action was already terrifying enough.
The intimidation it carried immediately made the assistant shudder and his legs weakened, almost unable to stand.
„Master Hong, I remember! Master Hong, please rest assured! I will do my best!“
The assistant was now terrified by Hongye. Even though Hongye hadn’t explained anything, the assistant had already guessed the outcome based on Hongye’s personality.
Moreover, this time Hongye was very explicit and had directly taken out the gun, making his implication clear. The assistant couldn’t continue to feign ignorance anymore.
This brief interruption made the assistant, threatened by Hongye, sweat profusely. His forehead was drenched in cold sweat, and his back clothes were soaked and stuck to his skin, feeling sticky.
But at this moment, the assistant didn’t dare to have any thoughts. He had always known that Hongye had climbed up through his own efforts, with blood on his hands and was absolutely not a kind or tolerant person.
He had recently been restraining his claws, but he had started to overstep, forgetting all of this.
„Hmph!“
Seeing the assistant’s fear and hesitation, Hongye let out a cold snort. He then withdrew his gaze and didn’t give the assistant any more glances.
It seemed as if the assistant was not worth his eyes, and Hongye didn’t want to soil them.
Hongye didn’t speak again. Since he had already threatened him, and the assistant had shown such obedience, and since these three days were still early, Hongye didn’t want to argue with him anymore.
Hongye waved his hand casually and dismissed the assistant.
The assistant, now in a desperate situation as if hunted by his enemy, received Hongye’s signal to leave and immediately rushed out, scrambling toward the door.
The assistant was afraid that if he moved a little slower, Hongye would be dissatisfied and punish him.
After the assistant left, Hongye’s right-hand man Qiyi entered at this moment.
„Father.“
Qiyi lowered his head and showed great respect to Hongye.
Qiyi was both Hongye’s right-hand man and his adopted son, an orphan Hongye had taken in.
Qiyi had once burned his brain and was somewhat dull, but among the Hong family, only Qiyi was completely loyal to Hongye.
Moreover, Qiyi had superhuman strength, able to lift the weight of a car with one hand.
Because of this, Hongye had invested a lot of effort in cultivating Qiyi. It was also because of Qiyi’s presence that Hongye had climbed to his current position so quickly.
Qiyi politely greeted Hongye and then approached him.
„What is it, Qiyi?“
Hongye raised his eyebrows in confusion and asked Qiyi.
Hongye was very clear that if it wasn’t a serious matter, Qiyi would never come to bother him. Moreover, he often entrusted tasks to Qiyi, and no matter how difficult they were, Qiyi would go through great hardships to complete them.
Sometimes Hongye thought that if Qiyi were his biological son, he could entrust the Hong family to him.
But this was just a fleeting thought of Hongye’s. Not only was Qiyi currently mentally impaired, but Hongye had just climbed to this position and wouldn’t easily hand over power.
„Father, the search team has returned.“
Qiyi, who was naturally dull and didn’t understand others’ expressions or the meaning of other people’s faces, remained respectful as he looked at Hongye and reported.
