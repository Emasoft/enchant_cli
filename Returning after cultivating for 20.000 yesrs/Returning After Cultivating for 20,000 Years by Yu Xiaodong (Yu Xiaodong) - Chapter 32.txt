Chapter 148: Turning Point

Because Su Nantian sat beside Zhang Mengyao, this action caused most girls to feel discontent. Some impetuous girls spoke harshly about Zhang Mengyao under their breath.

In the shadows, speaking ill of others, Su Nantian frowned; he disliked such behavior deeply.

But mocking was mocking—was this ugly creature really affecting the girl beside her? After all, the one by his side was also a young girl.

This made Su Nantian puzzled. He didn’t find her ugly, only somewhat disheveled. Yet these people kept mocking her as an “ugly creature.” Was this the most vicious way girls had to insult each other?

Su Nantian’s lips twitched. To satisfy his curiosity, he turned to the girl beside him and said, “Hello, my name is Su Nantian.”

Zhang Mengyao did not respond. She rested her head on her hand, letting the sunlight bathe her face.

Unsure of the reason, he noticed she was wearing earphones. Su Nantian took a piece of paper from his drawer, tore off a corner, crumpled it, and gently tossed it toward the girl’s ear. The earphones fell as if by accident.

The girl hurried to pick up the earphones and put them back in her ears. Su Nantian seized the opportunity to repeat, “Hello, my name is Su Nantian.”

The girl’s movements froze. She awkwardly turned to look at Su Nantian.

At that moment, a breeze blew in from the window, carrying the fragrance of flowers beneath the teaching building. It filled the air with a sense of serenity.

Zhang Mengyao seemed to realize something: “I heard you.”

Su Nantian smiled but said nothing, not even asking, “What’s your name?”

Zhang Mengyao saw Su Nantian only smile and say nothing. She didn’t know how to continue the conversation. After a while, she tried to put her earphones back on and gaze out the window in daydream.

But she couldn’t help asking, “Did you hear what they said about me?”

Su Nantian paused his actions and looked at Zhang Mengyao: “Yes.”

Zhang Mengyao immediately became agitated. She fiddled with her earphones and glanced at the window. During this time, Su Nantian said nothing but watched Zhang Mengyao’s direction, occasionally helping her arrange her books.

Zhang Mengyao lowered her head for a moment before finally lifting it to meet Su Nantian’s gaze directly and said, “Then why did you sit here after hearing their comments?”

Su Nantian felt his body was tired from sitting for too long, so he stretched his arms and pondered how to answer this question.

Su Nantian surveyed the girls who had stopped whispering and were now listening to Zhu Ying’s lecture.

The next moment, he leaned down and whispered into Zhang Mengyao’s ear: “Curiosity.”

Curiosity?

Zhang Mengyao’s ears grew hot. Her lips pressed into a straight line, and her previously calm expression now turned serious.

After observing her, Su Nantian’s expression gradually became earnest.

Zhang Mengyao looked at Su Nantian for a long time before extending one small hand to press against her face.

Su Nantian couldn’t help but admire: this girl looked disheveled, yet her hands were white as jade, with a faint pink hue.

Zhang Mengyao took a deep breath and lifted her hand to adjust her hair, revealing an irregularly shaped pigment birthmark on her face. This mark almost covered the upper half of Zhang Mengyao’s face, varying in depth—some parts were as dark as charcoal, others lighter but still clearly visible.

Su Nantian was stunned. He had previously wondered why this girl looked so disheveled, with thick bangs covering half her face.

Now seeing the bat-like birthmark on Zhang Mengyao’s face, Su Nantian suddenly understood. No wonder she had such thick bangs and no wonder the classmates kept mocking her as an “ugly creature.”

This bat-like birthmark on her face was indeed the epitome of an “ugly creature” in human society.

After regaining his composure, Su Nantian saw Zhang Mengyao’s vacant gaze. Compared to her previous calm expression, this one seemed lifeless. Following his line of sight, he saw the earphones. Without a doubt, she had been listening to them all her life to escape mockery, sitting alone in a corner, enjoying the sunlight.

“Ah.”

Su Nantian responded flatly.

Zhang Mengyao’s hand, which had lifted her bangs, trembled slightly. Her clear and bright eyes fixed on Su Nantian’s eyes, her curled lashes fluttering as she tried to glimpse his inner thoughts.

“Ah,” Su Nantian murmured, unable to resist reaching out to touch the birthmark and see how deeply it had embedded itself.

Zhang Mengyao, however, flinched like a startled rabbit at his reaction and retreated into the corner.

“Creak—” The chair scraped against the floor, producing an ear-piercing sound that echoed throughout the classroom.

This moment completely caught the class’s attention. Students sitting in front turned their heads, gazing at the two with curiosity.

Su Nantian remained unshaken and even cast a glare back at some of the girls.

Zhang Mengyao, however, couldn’t handle it. Seeing this scene, she quickly lowered her bangs, hiding half of her face beneath the thick hair, making it impossible to see her features.

Chapter 149: Zhang Mengyao’s Hope

After getting used to this lifestyle of being alone for so long, suddenly being noticed by so many people made her feel lost and nervous. In her anxiety, she even teared up, looking more pitiful.

“Haha… look at her! She’s so funny!”
“That’s right, she looks like a dog!”
“Good thing there's such a handsome man sitting beside her. He must be enjoying it endlessly!”

Some girls who were close to each other couldn’t help but laugh after seeing this.

Zhang Mengyao truly cried now, her fingers fidgeting with the hem of her clothes, tears falling one after another.

Su Nantian couldn’t bear it anymore. He had originally ignored them since they were girls, but these people had become increasingly unbearable.

“Smack!” Su Nantian suddenly slammed his hand on the desk, his eyes fierce as he hit it.

The entire class fell silent immediately.

“Is this fun? Before you mock others, check if your face is worthy of it.”

At that moment, those girls had already turned their heads away before Su Nantian’s anger fully manifested. However, they could still feel his cold gaze.

What to do? What to do? I’m so nervous… He was so fierce just now!

The girls could only exchange glances with each other, their bodies too afraid to move.

After they calmed down, Su Nantian didn’t pay them any more attention but took out a handkerchief he had brought that morning from his pocket and turned it toward the side.

Zhang Mengyao was lying on the desk, silently sobbing. This scene had clearly happened many times before.

Sigh… Su Nantian sighed in his heart. This little girl never fought back, did she?

But of course, words could be terrifying.

Su Nantian gently patted Zhang Mengyao’s shoulder but received no response. He then pressed a little harder.

Zhang Mengyao was surprised and slightly lifted her head to look at Su Nantian. Her small mouth opened, revealing a faintly visible tongue, but the thick bangs still couldn’t hide her confused gaze.

Su Nantian held out the handkerchief in front of her.

Zhang Mengyao was momentarily stunned, hesitant to reach out and take it.

“Wipe your eyes.”

Su Nantian, seeing her frightened expression, spoke gently.

“Thank you.”

Her voice was barely audible as she took it from his hand.

This handkerchief… it smelled of sandalwood, was it the unique scent on him? Besides her brother, no one had ever treated her like this.

Zhang Mengyao felt as if a warm furnace was burning in her heart. The hurtful words she had heard before now seemed powerless to her.

“I’ll wash it and return it to you.”

Zhang Mengyao said seriously, looking at Su Nantian.

Seeing her determination, Su Nantian didn’t say it wasn’t necessary to avoid hurting her self-esteem. He simply thought about her situation in his heart.

After a while, Su Nantian calmly lifted his head and spoke as if it were an ordinary matter: “The birthmark on your face, I can heal it.”

Zhang Mengyao was stunned. She remained silent for a while before murmuring, “What did you say?”

“I said I can heal your birthmark.”

Seeing Zhang Mengyao’s reaction, Su Nantian knew she didn’t believe it. She must have thought he was trying to comfort her, speaking nonsense.

Was he joking with me?

Heal my face?

Heal this birthmark that had haunted me for over a decade?

Although Zhang Mengyao’s inner thoughts were turbulent, she still feigned calmness and asked:

“Are you mocking me?”

Her voice trembled.

“No, I have no need to. I’m just telling the truth.”

“I don’t believe it! I’ve been to countless hospitals since childhood, and they all told me there was no solution.”

At this point, Zhang Mengyao fell into memories.

When she was young, her parents often worried about her face in places where she couldn’t see them and felt guilty. Although they pretended well on the surface, their eyes revealed sorrow.

As she grew older, kindergarten children kept her at a distance, no one wanted to approach her. Even getting close would make them feel they had touched something infectious and rush to wash their hands.

A child in a lane would throw stones at her, calling her to leave this place quickly and shouting “ugly creature,” a witch.

From then on, the word “ugly creature” became a deep label for her. No matter where she went, she would hear that word.

Why did they all have angelic faces but speak so cruelly?

At first, she didn’t understand. She would run home and cry around her mother’s legs, crying out why they treated her like this. But what could her mother do? She could only comfort her with “you’re a princess from heaven” and say she had to endure some hardships on earth.

This kind lie, she had long since seen through but held back from exposing it.

Later, her parents took her everywhere in search of solutions—big cities, small hospitals, even some private remedies. As long as there was a chance, they clung to it tightly.

After a long time, she became numb. Their family savings were also running out.

Each hope, each disappointment—no one knew what she had experienced.

Seeing her parents’ gradually aging faces, the once joyful home no longer argued with them. She forced herself to accept the burden she was born with.

Thinking of this, thinking about her family’s furrowed brows, Zhang Mengyao could no longer hide her inner thoughts.

Her voice gradually grew louder, and she seemed unaware that the class was discussing their own matters intensely, so no one noticed them.

“Many renowned doctors looked at my face and sighed heavily, telling me they were helpless.”

Zhang Mengyao’s gaze drifted as she continued to recall, speaking with her soft voice: “I remember one time a kind old man. My mother heard he was an expert in this field and had great prestige. That was the first time my parents went through so many connections to get him to treat me. Our whole family put all our hopes on him.”

“But he just lifted my hair and studied for a few minutes. Do you know how agonizing those minutes were for us?”

Zhang Mengyao spoke more and more passionately, no longer holding back with Su Nantian.

Su Nantian listened silently to her story, offering her silent comfort.

His thoughts drifted elsewhere; he was thinking about how beautiful she would be if this face could be healed.

Zhang Mengyao felt encouraged by his support and continued to speak: “He said sorry, you can’t be treated. No matter how many experts you find, the result will still be the same.”

At that moment, her mother almost collapsed. Her father held her up and she clung to his sleeve, crying desperately: “You’re an expert in this field, right? How can you say you can’t treat her?”

Chapter 150: The Election

The doctor was over fifty, his eyes devoid of emotion. He had seen many storms and didn’t say much comforting words because he knew they were useless. Instead, he slowly said: “This girl’s condition is something she was born with. Although birthmarks are usually treatable, this one is difficult…”

“Generally, we use surgery to remove it and take skin from another part of the body to attach here. This is what we call grafting.”

“But look at this birthmark—it’s tightly connected to the blood vessels. If we cut it even slightly, the facial nerves would be damaged. Lightly, it could lead to disfigurement; severely, it might cause madness.”

After saying this, he shook his head and sighed: “Therefore, the success rate is very low. We can’t guarantee what will happen during the surgery. Please leave.”

After hearing the expert’s words, her mother was already crying profusely and seemed to age instantly. Her father’s back bent further.

My mother was once so beautiful, yet she had been ruined by me. How could I bear it?

At this point, Zhang Mengyao’s eyes were red, her nails turned pale from gripping too tightly. Su Nantian saw this and felt a pang of guilt.

How should he tell her that it was just a minor issue in his eyes?

After all, it was only a large birthmark connected to the nerves. There was no need for so many years without healing it.

Birthmarks, as their name suggests, usually appear at birth. If he wasn’t mistaken, the best treatment on Earth was laser therapy. But as the old expert said, she had nerves underneath it, and with current technology, it was indeed difficult.

If only he were in the cultivation world, healing her face would be a trivial matter. But now, there was no such convenience. However, it didn’t mean there was no solution.

Su Nantian turned Zhang Mengyao’s face to look at him directly, even allowing her to see his reflection in her pupils.

Zhang Mengyao was stunned, looking at the boy before her. She felt his heart beating rapidly.

“I can heal you. I’m not lying.”

Zhang Mengyao felt she might have been drugged, otherwise why was she so excited?

“But they all said I could never be healed.”

Su Nantian gently brushed the strands of hair from her ear and leaned down to whisper in her ear: “That’s because you hadn’t met me yet.”

Zhang Mengyao’s face turned red, and tears fell like pearls.

At this moment, a girl in front suddenly turned her head and saw the intimate scene. She quickly poked the girl beside her, signaling them to turn back.

The others received the signal and covered their mouths in surprise, turning back.

Wow, what did I just see? Su Nantian was so close to her! Doesn’t he fear being infected?

Sorry, my eyes are blind.

The girls all took out their phones and tapped on the keyboards.

“What’s going on? Are we not as pretty as her?”
“Open your eyes, she looks like a ghost.”
“I wish I had sat alone instead. Now it might be me sitting next to him.”
“She’s really a sly one, rushing in so quickly after he just arrived.”

Zhang Mengyao, caught up in excitement, didn’t realize she had become the thorn in the eyes of most girls in the class.

At that moment, she lifted her eyelids slightly and asked carefully: “Do you know how to do it? You don’t look much older than me.”

Su Nantian smiled faintly and shrugged indifferently.

“Others said you couldn’t have the surgery, so we’ll try another method. In this ancient civilization, why not use traditional Chinese medicine that has been passed down for thousands of years instead of Western methods?”

Hearing this, Zhang Mengyao felt ashamed and lowered her head. They had desperately sought solutions before but hadn’t thought of this.

“Acupuncture and moxibustion from traditional Chinese medicine can completely remove the melanin inside you. Just give me a few weeks.”

Su Nantian made a solemn promise, for in his eyes, this was trivial.

Zhang Mengyao grabbed Su Nantian’s hand excitedly: “Really? Can it be healed?”

Her small hands were soft, like glutinous rice balls, smooth and delicate. For a moment, Su Nantian was dazed.

Zhang Mengyao realized what she had done and quickly pulled her hand back, apologizing with a smile: “Sorry, I was too excited…”

“Why didn’t you tell your family about this?”

Su Nantian was a bit puzzled. Usually, when someone had such a surprise, they would call their family first, right?

“They’re dead.”

“Sorry.” Su Nantian couldn’t help but feel pity for Zhang Mengyao’s tragic background.

“It’s okay.” Zhang Mengyao said.

While Su Nantian and Zhang Mengyao were discussing how to remove the birthmark, the class representative Zhu Ying had already finished her introductions and started the official first lesson of the semester.

Generally, the first class after school starts is used to discuss matters related to the start of school and the schedule for upcoming classes. Even in this unusual school, the first lesson was about these trivial matters.

Su Nantian didn’t care much about this; he was always energetic and could multitask. Therefore, while chatting with Zhang Mengyao, he had already heard every movement in the class clearly.

This included Zhu Ying’s speech on stage. Zhu Ying’s voice was a mature and sexy “senior girl” tone, which Su Nantian found very appealing. In this world, although he lived with three girls, this type of girl was his first encounter.

Therefore, since he saw Zhu Ying on the first day, he had diverted some of his attention to her. Every action and word she said was clear to him.

At this moment, Zhu Ying stood on the stage giving a speech about school matters. The podium blocked her long and beautiful legs, but it couldn’t hide her slender waist.

Some boys in the class, although they seemed to be listening carefully to Zhu Ying’s teachings, were actually staring at her waist with their eyes.

Zhu Ying’s mouth was also very beautiful, small yet slightly thick. Her upper lip was much thinner than her lower one. However, this mouth was small and resembled a ripe cherry. Each time it opened and closed, many people were already entranced by this small cherry mouth.

Even Su Nantian was drawn to her cherry mouth and looked at Zhu Ying more than once.

Chapter 151: Election

Zhu Ying continued her speech without tiring, but Su Nantian listened as if it were left ear and right ear.

Su Nantian chose the back seat not only because he disliked the noise in front but also because he liked the feeling of being high up in a tiered classroom. Plus, his eyesight was extraordinary; with one glance, he could see everything happening in the entire classroom.

Su Nantian’s gaze swept over the people sitting in the seats. Girls were applying makeup, sending messages; boys were dozing, pushing each other, and playing games. Those who seemed to be listening carefully to Zhu Ying’s teachings were also filled with hearts.

Su Nantian smiled and let out a snort.

Zhu Ying, facing these uncooperative students, continued her speech without tiring.

“From tomorrow on, you will face a two-week military training…”

As soon as this sentence was spoken, the students who were busy with other things all groaned. This scene made Su Nantian even more amused.

Zhu Ying immediately waved her hands to calm the restless students: “Students, students, stay calm. It’s just two weeks of military training. It will pass in a blink. After the military training, you can sign up for your favorite clubs and start your pleasant four-year university life!”

After being comforted by the beautiful teacher, the students all cheered again. Even Zhang Mengyao couldn’t help but laugh.

“Why are you laughing?” Su Nantian asked.

“You don’t think Zhu Ying teacher is like a monkey trainer?” After laughing, Zhang Mengyao immediately returned to her calm expression. “Maybe I said too much.”

Su Nantian shook his head and smiled: “I felt the same way.”

Zhang Mengyao, upon hearing this, looked at Su Nantian with a different expression in her eyes.

At that moment, Zhu Ying finally reached the topic everyone had been looking forward to: “Students, now we will do something big together. A class needs a leader, so I encourage students to introduce themselves and run for class positions!”

As soon as this was said, the classroom erupted in applause.

Then Zhu Ying stepped down from the podium and handed it over to those who wanted to show off.

This made Su Nantian feel very bored. Zhu Ying had left, what else was there to watch?

Zhang Mengyao poked Su Nantian’s arm and said: “Do you want to go up and try?”

Su Nantian raised an eyebrow: “Are you going to perform a monkey show for me?”

Zhang Mengyao smiled again: “I’m doing it for your sake.” After saying this, she no longer looked at Su Nantian but turned her attention to the personal campaign on stage.

One after another, people stood up and took turns. Some were obviously just showing off, going up for a quick appearance before leaving.

Then, a tall figure stood up from the crowd. He walked calmly to the stage with an elegant and composed demeanor, introducing himself: “Hello everyone, my name is Shen Fei. I’m running for the position of class monitor today. Since I started school, this position has been mine. Although it’s sometimes tiring, seeing my classmates achieve greater glory under my leadership makes me satisfied. Thank you all.”

As soon as Shen Fei finished, the classroom erupted in enthusiastic applause. Su Nantian raised his eyebrows; it seemed Shen Fei was very skilled at winning people over. This way, the class monitor position would likely be Shen Fei’s.

After finishing his self-introduction, Shen Fei walked down from the stage. Having received so much applause, this made him even more determined to secure the class monitor position.

As long as…

Shen Fei glanced at Su Nantian’s seat and frowned. Shen Fei thought: this Su Nantian is better than me in appearance and strength. If he also got involved, how many chances would I have to get the class monitor position?

Thinking about this, Shen Fei’s expression grew heavier. When he passed by Zhu Ying, she thought he was just nervous and hurriedly patted his shoulder: “Shen Fei, your speech was very good. I believe the students will remember you well. Don’t be nervous.” Then Zhu Ying looked at everyone and said: “Students, let’s give Shen Fei another round of applause, okay?”

The classroom immediately erupted in enthusiastic applause. Shen Fei’s background was known to those who had the insight, and even those who didn’t know were already won over by him in this short class. Therefore, Zhu Ying easily rallied the applause.

Shen Fei immediately put on an emotional expression and nodded to everyone: “Thank you for your support. I, Shen Fei, will do my best for all of you. Even if I don’t become the class monitor, I will dedicate myself to the class!”

After Shen Fei said this, another round of applause followed. Many male students came up and carried Shen Fei back to his seat.

Zhang Mengyao wrapped her arms around the table and lay down, listening to music quietly. She muttered: “Sly.”

Su Nantian had sharp hearing, and since they were so close, he clearly heard Zhang Mengyao’s muttering. However, Su Nantian didn’t ask anything; first, it would raise Zhang Mengyao’s suspicion. Second, they were in the same class. Over time, everyone would eventually find out what kind of person he was.

Zhu Ying looked at Shen Fei with satisfaction. Then she stepped onto the podium and urged: “Alright, are there any other students who want to introduce themselves and compete for class positions? Once this opportunity is missed, it won’t come again.”

After Zhu Ying said this, many girls in the class turned their eyes toward Su Nantian’s seat.

Shen Fei noticed this and felt some tension, looking at Su Nantian with concern.

Among them, a bold girl stood up and said to Su Nantian: “Su Nantian, don’t you want to go up and compete for class positions? If you run, we will all support you!”

As soon as this was said, many girls echoed. Shen Fei’s expression became even more tense, but no one noticed his tension. At this moment, everyone's eyes were on Su Nantian, even Zhu Ying looked at him from the podium with an expression that said “come on, come on.”

After so many silent invitations, Su Nantian lowered his eyes and then put on the legendary “polite smile” and said: “Thank you for your kindness, but I’m not interested.”

After being a senior immortal for twenty thousand years, how could he be interested in such things?

Chapter 152: The Result

Those girls who had previously invited Su Nantian to the stage saw him as a fake noble. The girl who had just said she would support Su Nantian was stunned, then looked at him with disdain: “No confidence, no confidence. Why act so noble?”

These words naturally reached Su Nantian’s ears, and even Zhang Mengyao heard them clearly: “Women change their minds faster than flipping a page.”

Su Nantian smiled: “You’re also a woman, aren’t you?”

Zhang Mengyao hesitated: “Don’t say it.”

At this moment, everyone who had supported Su Nantian turned their expressions into disdain. They all thought Su Nantian was fake noble, actually lacking confidence and disappointing everyone’s goodwill.

The only one who was happy was Shen Fei, thinking: Su Nantian is a fool. At this critical moment, he publicly embarrassed himself; who would support him? Not running was exactly what he wanted.

Zhu Ying saw Su Nantian publicly refusing others and thought he was too self-important, but Su Nantian had been specially requested by Yuan Xiong.

Zhu Ying quickly made an excuse: “Alright, students, our election is over. Now you can vote for your favorite class positions.”

Zhu Ying called out a student who had never been on stage before. This person was very low-key, and no one noticed their presence until Zhu Ying called them out.

This made Su Nantian respect Zhu Ying even more; this class advisor was truly meticulous.

“Next, I’ll announce a position, and you can put the name of the person you have in mind into this red box.” Zhu Ying took out a red box, typical of a lottery box.

Then she wrote down the positions on the blackboard one by one, and the election process in the classroom proceeded smoothly.

Soon, the class positions were all elected. Zhu Ying looked at the names with the most votes on the blackboard and marked them with red chalk.

“Alright, I’ll summarize now. Students whose names are called please come up to the podium so everyone can get to know each other.”

“Class representative, Shen Fei.”

“Here!”

“Sports committee member, Song Jinming.”

“Okay.”

……

“Study committee member, Cao Yun.”

“Yes.”

A graceful girl came up to the podium. Cao Yun had eyes like water, a small and high nose, and her whole face was pink.

As soon as Cao Yun came up, someone in the class shouted: “Class beauty! Class beauty!”

Cao Yun’s face turned even redder in response to the cheers.

The final suspense was the most important position, class monitor. Under everyone’s expectant gaze, Zhu Ying opened her lips and said two words: “Shen Fei.”

Shen Fei looked surprised, thanking everyone while standing beside Cao Yun. Zhang Mengyao squinted and saw that aside from Shen Fei’s character, he thought the two were very compatible.

This election was greatly satisfactory to everyone in the class because they had all voted for these positions. Especially Shen Fei, who received almost full votes, and it was expected that he would manage the class smoothly.

“Do you think Shen Fei and Cao Yun are compatible?” Zhang Mengyao tapped Su Nantian’s arm with her index finger.

Su Nantian leaned toward Zhang Mengyao and said: “Not compatible.”

Who was incompatible with whom, no need for Su Nantian to say. Zhang Mengyao clearly knew it.

Seeing the newly elected class committee members on stage, all radiant and smiling, Zhang Mengyao smiled.

“Do you know these two people?” Su Nantian asked.

Zhang Mengyao nodded: “I thought you really didn’t care about the outside world. I know them, do you want to know more?”

Su Nantian leaned toward Zhang Mengyao again: “Know more, tell me.”

Zhang Mengyao cleared her throat and told Su Nantian in detail.

“This study committee member is named Cao Yun, the ‘yùn’ in ‘yùn味’ (flavor). Look at her, she’s so delicate and elegant, like a traditional lady.”

Su Nantian nodded and looked at Cao Yun again. This glance collided with Cao Yun’s, making Su Nantian raise an eyebrow. Cao Yun quickly looked away and her face turned red again.

“Then?” Su Nantian asked.

“That’s because she comes from a family of high-level intellectuals—literary masters, politicians, and in her family, these are common identities.”

Su Nantian nodded.

Zhang Mengyao cleared her throat again and continued: “Now, let’s talk about the class monitor. His name is Shen Fei.”

“Shen Fei is a rich second-generation in Fengcheng. However, people usually don’t see the arrogant and domineering attitude of a rich second-generation on him. This is because this person is very good at hiding.”

“Once you know Shen Fei later, you’ll find he’s not very good.”

Su Nantian nodded: “Understood.”

After Zhang Mengyao introduced Shen Fei and Cao Yun’s detailed situations to Su Nantian, the people on stage had already dispersed back to their seats. Only Zhu Ying remained as a class advisor on the podium.

Clearly, Zhu Ying was going to give a final summary and end this election.

“Everyone has already elected the class committee members, who are all your chosen people. Therefore, in the future, you must listen to the class committee members and enjoy your happy four-year university life under their leadership.”

As soon as Zhu Ying finished this speech, the bell for class ended.

Su Nantian looked out the window through Zhang Mengyao and saw that the vast campus, which had been empty just now, was now bustling with people, filled with sunlight and vitality.

On the podium, Zhu Ying said a few more words about tomorrow’s military training before holding her materials and walking out of the classroom in high heels.

Zhu Ying had barely left the classroom when she almost bumped into the new students, and her pile of materials nearly slipped from her hands. Zhu Ying only frowned slightly and steadied the materials in her arms. The two boys who had almost collided with Zhu Ying were stunned.

They hadn’t expected that the class advisor of the neighboring class would be such a beautiful young woman. This was much better than their own class’s loud and rowdy大妈 (old lady).

After stabilizing the materials, Zhu Ying was about to head back to the office. The two boys then realized and hurriedly followed her on both sides.

“Teacher, it was our fault.”
“Teacher, let me help you carry it.”

Zhu Ying wanted to refuse but hadn’t even finished speaking before the materials in her arms were divided and carried by two students.

“Okay, thank you. Follow me.” Zhu Ying rubbed her temples and put on a smiling expression again. She thought: when dealing with students, one shouldn’t be too harsh; it’s not good.

The two boys were satisfied and followed Zhu Ying, chatting with her intermittently.
