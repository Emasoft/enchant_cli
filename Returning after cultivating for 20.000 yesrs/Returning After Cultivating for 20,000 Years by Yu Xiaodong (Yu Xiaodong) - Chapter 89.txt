But it was ultimately too late.

If Su Nantian had been in his usual state, he would have sensed someone lurking behind him. However, this time his attention was entirely consumed by Wu You'er. Moreover, the man was a seasoned practitioner; he moved without a sound, making him even harder to detect. Thus, Su Nantian had fallen into this trap.

Su Nantian did not truly care about being ambushed, as no one could kill him with a single strike. But this time, he was unaware that the man carried an item—a powerful voltage button.

This device could cripple or even kill someone. It revealed how arrogant and resentful the man was toward Su Nantian.

Although Su Nantian had no prior enmity with Wu You'er, he had lost face in front of his subordinates. Furthermore, when he came to find Wu You'er, he had assured the family that he would bring her back. Yet now, an unexpected obstacle—Su Nantian himself—had defeated him. This left him with no dignity, both in front of his men and likely to be mocked by others upon returning.

Hence, he had resorted to this desperate measure.

If Su Nantian had been on high alert normally, this device would have been useless. But this time, he was completely unguarded. When the button touched his body, he felt his vision go dark and collapsed.

Before losing consciousness, Su Nantian's sole thought was: "No good—Wu You'er is about to be taken."

When Su Nantian awoke, he was already at home. Wen Ran watched over him anxiously, while Zhang Bao sat on the sofa.

Su Nantian suddenly sat up and asked Zhang Bao, "Where is Wu You'er? Has she been taken?"

Zhang Bao stood up immediately and nodded, "After you fainted, we couldn't fight them off. Our men were all injured. To prevent further harm, Wu You'er voluntarily went with them."

Seeing Zhang Bao's pitiful expression, Su Nantian didn't blame him. But upon hearing the confirmation, his inner anger was undeniable.

"Wu You'er? Are you alright? Do you feel any pain?" Wen Ran asked with genuine concern. He wasn't worried about Wu You'er; he was first concerned for Su Nantian, who had just regained consciousness.

"I'm fine. Don't worry. I was just caught off guard. I feel great now, no pain anywhere," Su Nantian said, stretching his body to show Wen Ran how well he was.

In truth, Su Nantian had wanted to rush to Jingdu immediately. But upon seeing Wen Ran, he remembered that the affairs of Tihao Group weren't fully resolved yet. He couldn't leave a mess for Wen Ran to handle.

After much deliberation, Su Nantian decided to finish Tihao Group's matters first. As for Jingdu, he could have friends investigate the Wu family's situation.

After all, since they had taken Wu Tao and his wife along with Wu You'er, it meant something was happening within the family. Moreover, Su Nantian believed they were still family and wouldn't harm them.

Thus, he could handle Tihao Group's affairs first before rushing to Jingdu—there was still time.

Wen Ran, seeing Su Nantian's silence, thought he was still worried about Wu You'er. "I know you're concerned about Wu You'er, and I am too. But if you want to go to Jingdu, make sure your health is good first—only then will I feel at ease."

Wen Ran would never oppose Su Nantian's rescue mission for Wu You'er, but only if Su Nantian's safety was guaranteed.

"I'm not planning to go immediately. I'll finish Tihao Group's matters first, then head to Jingdu. It's time to wrap up Zhang Feng. No more waiting."

In truth, Su Nantian still worried about Wen Ran being alone at Tihao Group. He wanted to clear the obstacles for him. Moreover, if he could take down Zhang Feng this time, it would serve as a warning to Tihao Group's people, making them more cautious.

Upon hearing this, Wen Ran felt a lump in his throat. He hadn't expected Su Nantian to still care about him.

"Zhang Bao, come here. I have something to say." He waved at Zhang Bao sitting on the sofa. Originally, he had come to talk about something with Zhang Bao, but Wu You'er's incident delayed it. Now was the time to resume.

Zhang Bao hurried over immediately, smiling and saying, "Big brother, what's the matter?"

"Give you some money. Immediately register a new company. Find two more people. I have another company to transfer the legal representative's name. Then, have someone from the new company go with the old one to negotiate business with Tihao Group. I'll give you further instructions later—go do it now," Su Nantian said, waving his hand to signal Zhang Bao to leave.

Chapter 433: Preparation

Su Nantian's plan was simple, just like the previous fake bidding meeting that exposed Li Hounian. He had Zhang Bao register a company and take over an old one, essentially having both companies conduct the same project with Tihao Group.

People like Zhang Feng, who managed finances, were crucial in the entire process. Thus, Su Nantian repeated his old tactics to lure Zhang Feng out.

This time was more complicated. Once he lured Zhang Feng out, Tihao Group's financial operations would fall back into Su Nantian's hands.

Previously, he hadn't exposed the fake bidding meeting because he anticipated future developments. If Zhang Feng had known it was a setup, he would have remained vigilant for a long time, fearing Su Nantian's trap.

After receiving Su Nantian's orders, Zhang Bao immediately left to handle the matter. Wen Ran and Su Nantian remained together.

"Are you really okay?" Wen Ran was still worried. Though he had called a doctor to check Su Nantian, the results showed no injuries. However, since Su Nantian had been ambushed and knocked out, it was the first time Wen Ran had seen this.

Su Nantian smiled and flexed his muscles, "Does this look like something's wrong? I just didn't expect that person to use such a trick. It was a strong current, so I fainted. A regular current wouldn't have affected me at all."

He thought of the Wu family's man, surprised that he had used such a method to defeat him. This was truly something the heavens would despise. After their fight, Su Nantian had even praised him for being a true practitioner. But now, he realized that this man had resorted to any means to win and take Wu You'er. This destroyed all the slight respect Su Nantian had for him.

But Su Nantian's current task was to sort out Tihao Group's internal forces. Only then could he feel at ease when going to Jingdu to find Wu You'er.

"Let me clean up Tihao Group's internal forces for you. Then I'll go to Jingdu to find Wu You'er. Are you okay staying here alone?" Su Nantian was still worried, as Wen Ran would be alone after he left. Though there were help from the Shadow Assassins, Su Nantian still felt uneasy.

Wen Ran smiled and said, "Don't worry. I'll be fine. Once you sort out these matters for me, I can get back on track. Plus, you've already sent Shadow Assassins to accompany me. And now that the Cold family has declined, and Zhang Bao is your subordinate, no one in Hangcheng would dare to mess with me."

Wen Ran naturally wanted Su Nantian to feel at ease, not wanting him to be held back by his own problems. Moreover, Wen Ran was also worried about Wu You'er and hoped Su Nantian would go to Jingdu immediately. But Su Nantian's plan was to handle other matters first, and Wen Ran couldn't persuade him otherwise.

Su Nantian nodded, his eyes softening. "Don't worry—I'll never let you suffer or be bullied."

With that, Su Nantian pulled Wen Ran into his arms and they embraced passionately.

It was undeniable that Zhang Bao's efficiency was impressive. Plus, he had his own connections and resources here, so registering the company went smoothly. It took less than a few hours to complete all procedures. He also followed Su Nantian's instructions to find the old company and send some people to take over.

Once everything was settled, Zhang Bao had no idea what to do next. Su Nantian had only told him to do this, so he didn't know what to do next.

Zhang Bao immediately called Su Nantian for instructions.

Su Nantian had just finished his intimate moment with Wen Ran when his phone started ringing incessantly. He answered impatiently.

"Boss, everything's done. What should we do next? Give your orders," Zhang Bao respectfully said.

Su Nantian had intended to get angry, but upon thinking that Zhang Bao was handling the task properly and doing it so quickly, he felt it deserved praise. Sometimes getting angry at him might make people uneasy.

"Good, Zhang Bao. You're becoming faster these days. Since everything's done, find a few people to go in and invest some capital. Don't let it look like a shell company—make sure they appear to be operating normally. Find some small deals from other places to make the books look good, especially for the new company. The old one has financial records—have someone sort those out."

Su Nantian spoke clearly, and Zhang Bao's end immediately had people note down each instruction.

"Here's the plan: invest one hundred million yuan into the new company. I'll have someone transfer the money to you later. In two days, go to Tihao Group to negotiate business. I'll announce the cooperation externally. Then have them come over. Oh, by the way, as for those people, I'll send a few of my men to act as heads. They can come to Tihao Group for the business."

Su Nantian naturally wanted Shadow Assassins to go, as Zhang Bao's group was too well-known in Hangcheng. If they went, it would inevitably expose them, but Shadow Assassins were different.

Shadow Assassins had been hired by the Cold family to assassinate Su Nantian. Only Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yeyu were well-known, while the others had rarely appeared.

At this time, Qi Yinzhen was handling business contacts at Tihao Group. Qi Yeyu and the other Shadow Assassins should be able to play a role now.

Thus, Su Nantian thought that only these people could both remain unnoticed and give him peace of mind.

Zhang Bao naturally had no objections. He knew his subordinates were too obvious in the city, having left their footprints everywhere. If he sent them over, it would inevitably expose a flaw, making the situation worse.

"Understood, boss. I'll do everything as instructed," Zhang Bao said after noting down all the tasks.

"Good, I'll contact you later. For now, do as I said," Su Nantian nodded in satisfaction. The final act of Tihao Group was about to begin.

Chapter 434: Meeting

The next day, Su Nantian immediately went to Tihao Group. The first thing he and Wen Ran did was announce the company's cooperation.

The reason was simple: due to Li Hounian's issue in the previous bidding meeting, they couldn't get the contract. Thus, they needed new business cooperation to ensure Tihao Group's future profits.

Zhang Feng and Wang Ruichang naturally had no objections, as this was a move to benefit Tihao Group. If they opposed it at this time, it would only show their bad intentions.

Moreover, Wang Ruichang didn't want to go independent and had no major issues with Su Nantian. He was the most honest employee, even as a high-ranking official, he knew he was just an advanced worker.

However, Zhang Feng's internal calculations were quite loud. He wanted to use his current position to make some side profits. Moreover, Li Hounian's incident was a warning for him, making him realize that Tihao Group wasn't what it used to be.

Su Nantian had already coordinated with Zhang Bao, sending the business information so they could come over immediately in the afternoon.

Soon after, Qi Yeyu disguised as a company's general manager came to negotiate business. Another company was handled by the pharmacist.

These two were naturally old acquaintances of Su Nantian, and he felt at ease with them handling the matter.

"Chairman, President, you announced the business bidding this morning. Someone has come to cooperate with us," Wang Tian said at that moment, having changed his appearance through makeup. He had already accessed all the business information from Li Houchuang, so this business was handled by him.

Qi Yinzhen followed the normal process to inform Su Nantian and Wen Ran. He also knew that these two people were sent by Su Nantian, everything was just a setup.

"Originally, this business only needed you to handle it. But since this is my first business after taking over Tihao Group, I still want to see it. By the way, have you called in the finance department and human resources department? Since two companies are negotiating together," Tian said, actually to find a reason to involve himself and Zhang Feng in this business so he could continue his next steps.

Qi Yinzhen nodded immediately and left to find Zhang Feng and Wang Ruichang per Su Nantian's instructions.

Soon after, several people sat in the meeting room. Su Nantian and Wen Ran were the last to arrive.

"Everyone, please wait," Su Nantian said upon entering the meeting room.

He glanced around at everyone present. Besides Qi Yeyu and the pharmacist, it was Zhang Feng, Wang Ruichang, and Qi Yinzhen who had taken over the business department.

"Su General, we are from Ke Mao Limited. We came immediately after seeing your announcement about seeking partners this morning," Qi Yeyu said, handing Su Nantian a business card to show his seriousness.

The pharmacist also didn't lag behind, standing up and smiling, "Su General, I'm sure you've heard of our company's name. We're an old enterprise in Hangcheng, but we haven't collaborated with Tihao Group before. This time, we hope for an opportunity to cooperate—something new enterprises can't compare with."

At first, Qi Yeyu and the pharmacist created a tense atmosphere. This was also Su Nantian's instruction—no need to be polite at first, just make the atmosphere tense and exciting.

Because the more intense the environment, the better it would draw out Zhang Feng later.

"Actually, our company's recruitment of partners mainly focuses on your strength. As long as you have enough capability, whether new or old enterprises, we can cooperate. This business requires the best quote, fastest speed, and highest quality to be chosen as a partner," Qi Yinzhen said with a smile. After all, he was the head of the business department now; these things needed to be handled by him. Su Nantian and Wen Ran's presence was just for supervision.

"Regarding this project's quote and technical expectations, we've put them in this document. Please review it," Qi Yeyu immediately handed over a file.

Qi Yinzhen also didn't lag behind, handing over a file. These were all pre-arranged by Su Nantian and done so authentically that one could immediately tell it was a genuine expectation document, not just an empty shell for this operation.

Su Nantian took the documents from them, glanced at them briefly, then smiled and said, "Let's talk about cooperation later. We've received your documents. As for the details and process of this cooperation, I think it's better for our business department head to discuss with the two of you in detail."

Su Nantian's words were correct; a business couldn't be done so hastily.

After saying this, Su Nantian stood up and smiled at everyone present, then said, "Everyone, please continue discussing. I just came to check. I've already understood the situation. You can discuss it in detail later."

After saying this, Su Nantian gave Wen Ran a meaningful glance. The two of them then left the room, as if they didn't leave, it would be hard for Zhang Feng to have contact with Qi Yeyu and the pharmacist.

After Su Nantian left, Qi Yinzhen also had a brief discussion with the two people. They exchanged business cards and ensured they had each other's contact information, so they could have private communication.

"Today's situation is like this. The quotes from both companies and the commitments you've made are in the documents. We'll take them back to study carefully. As for who will be chosen for this project, we will definitely prioritize the group's interests. We also need to carefully examine and evaluate internally. We'll give both companies a satisfactory reply. Thank you for coming over today. I'll send you out," Qi Yinzhen said, giving a meaningful glance to Qi Yeyu and the pharmacist before sending them out.

Before leaving, Qi Yeyu gave Zhang Feng a meaningful smile. Then he followed Qi Yeyu and the pharmacist out of the meeting room.

Zhang Feng watched the three leave, then gave a meaningful smile as well.

Chapter 435: Secret Contact

Su Nantian knew that someone like Zhang Feng, a veteran, wouldn't be lured so quickly. Previously, Li Hounian had been caught because he was too hasty.

Now that there was a precedent with Li Hounian, even if Zhang Feng didn't know this was all orchestrated by Su Nantian, he had become very cautious.

Previously, Qi Yeyu's meaningful smile at him had already conveyed the message to Zhang Feng. His return smile was also giving himself a way out—if this matter wasn't discovered, they could profit together. But if Tihao Group became too strict because of Li Hounian's incident, Zhang Feng could also choose to watch and wait without acting.

So, Zhang Feng's return smile didn't mean much. It only showed he understood Qi Yeyu's intention, but whether he would act was still unknown.

Su Nantian had already known this wouldn't be so smooth, especially since Tihao Group had undergone a major change. These high-ranking officials were now all very cautious and obedient.

In fact, these high-ranking managers of Tihao Group often had small thefts, taking a few extra dollars for themselves. It was common to take some oil money. Su Nantian didn't even bother to manage them, as a company couldn't be completely secure. It wasn't bad for subordinates to have some extra money; being too strict would make Tihao Group unstable.

But since Li Hounian's incident, almost everyone had stopped their operations. They all knew this, especially Zhang Feng.

He had personally gone to the bidding meeting with Li Hounian and seen him get caught. Compared to others, he could deeply feel the gravity of this incident.

So Zhang Feng was now in self-preservation mode. Even if Qi Yeyu and the pharmacist were secretly contacting him, he wouldn't immediately agree.

But Su Nantian had already anticipated this. He told Qi Yeyu and the pharmacist not to rush, but to gradually build trust with Zhang Feng.

Moreover, Qi Yeyu and the pharmacist were now in different camps. Even if Zhang Feng was very cautious, he would never suspect these two were actually allies.

At the same time, Su Nantian hadn't forgotten Wu You'er in Jingdu. He wanted to finish other matters quickly, so he couldn't go to Jingdu himself. However, he still had someone in Jingdu investigating the Wu family's situation.

Su Nantian didn't ask anyone else but Song Lichen. He had previously asked Song Lichen to be the intermediary between himself and the Dragon family, which was already a debt of gratitude. So this time, he didn't bother anyone else but still asked Song Lichen. If he was going to repay the favor, it would be better to do it all for one person.

Song Lichen immediately agreed. Although this matter was related to the Wu family, these major families usually didn't interfere with each other and maintained a peaceful state. But this time was just Su Nantian asking for information, not to have Song family oppose the Wu family. So for Song Lichen, this wasn't a big deal.

Moreover, Song Lichen knew that by doing this, Su Nantian would owe him another favor. Why not do it? As a businessman, he naturally understood the benefits of this.

Song Lichen also knew that someone like Su Nantian would definitely be helpful to him in the future.

Meanwhile, Qi Yeyu followed Su Nantian's instructions to try contacting Zhang Feng. That night, Qi Yeyu called him using the business card he had given earlier.

"Hello, who is this?" The call was answered with that voice.

"Director Zhang, hello. I'm from Ke Mao Company. We came to Tihao Group to discuss business today. Do you remember me?" Qi Yeyu immediately introduced himself.

"Oh, I remember Ke Mao Company came to us for the bidding. What's the matter with you calling me at this time?" Zhang Feng asked, feigning ignorance. He clearly knew that the call was to get him to help.

"Director Zhang, I won't beat around the bush. Let me tell you directly. Regarding this business matter, can you help us?" Qi Yeyu immediately revealed his intention.

Dealing with a veteran like Zhang Feng was useless. It was better to be direct, as this allowed both sides to negotiate.

"Ah, this matter. You know I'm just the finance director. This business isn't my responsibility,"

Exactly as Su Nantian had predicted, Zhang Feng wouldn't immediately agree. He would use this identity to refuse.

Qi Yeyu couldn't help but give Su Nantian a thumbs-up in his mind. Su Nantian had already predicted Zhang Feng's thoughts.

The next step, Su Nantian had also told Qi Yeyu.

Actually, if it were Qi Yinzhen handling this, it would be easier for him. But now we need to take over the business department at Tihao Group, so only Qi Yeyu and the pharmacist could do it.

Qi Yeyu and the pharmacist knew little about these things. They needed Su Nantian to teach them the strategies of business negotiations.

"Director Zhang, I know you're the finance director. But Tihao Group's internal investigations showed that you are the most capable. Previously, there was Li Hounian, but now he's no longer effective. Who holds the most power within Tihao Group? It's definitely you,"

Qi Yeyu followed Su Nantian's instructions and started by flattering him. He intentionally mentioned Li Hounian, knowing that this was a thorn in Zhang Feng's heart. Bringing it up was to pull out this thorn from Zhang Feng's heart.

If Qi Yeyu never mentioned it, Zhang Feng would keep thinking about Li Hounian and be unable to act. So Su Nantian had directly instructed Qi Yeyu and the pharmacist that when they spoke with Zhang Feng, they shouldn't avoid this topic.

Chapter 436: Speak to People

Sure enough, after Qi Yeyu mentioned Li Hounian, he could clearly feel Zhang Feng on the other end of the phone suddenly fell silent.

After a few seconds, only to hear Zhang Feng say, "Ah, you're too kind. I'm just a finance director. For this matter, you should talk to the business department."

Zhang Feng still played his usual game without any intention of cooperating with Qi Yeyu.

"Director Zhang, we certainly have considered the business department. But you can definitely speak for us. You're in charge of finance, which is the most important department in every group and company. We are sincerely willing to cooperate with you. Please let us know your conditions," Qi Yeyu continued, gradually revealing his tempting conditions.

Before Zhang Feng could respond, Qi Yeyu added, "Director Zhang, you know our company is newly established. This opportunity to cooperate with a big enterprise like Tihao Group is what we've been dreaming of. If this deal takes off, our business will definitely thrive. You'll be a great benefactor to us."

In addition to financial conditions, Qi Yeyu also mentioned the human condition. The implication was that if Zhang Feng helped this small company take root, they would owe him a big favor.

"Ah, I know Ke Mao Company is newly established and needs opportunities. And Tihao Group mainly values ability, the company's age doesn't matter. If Ke Mao Company has enough strength, I believe this cooperation will definitely fall into your hands," Zhang Feng still didn't budge and spoke in polite words.

Qi Yeyu heard this and could only nod. He remembered Su Nantian's instructions before: after three rounds of negotiation, if Zhang Feng still didn't budge, there was no need to keep arguing this issue. Just convey his intention and if Zhang Feng had the idea, he would contact him later.

Qi Yeyu fully implemented Su Nantian's teachings. He smiled and said to the other end of the phone, "Director Zhang, I understand your meaning. But I hope you can think carefully about what I said earlier. We've always kept the door open for you."

After saying this, Qi Yeyu didn't continue arguing with Zhang Feng. He politely said goodbye and hung up the phone.

After Qi Yeyu hung up, Zhang Feng felt a little itch. He knew that since Su Nantian took over Tihao Group, these high-ranking officials had been living day by day worse.

Originally, when the Cold family controlled Tihao Group, they had taken a lot of oil. But now they were too afraid to do it. Especially with Li Hounian's incident happening recently, it had sounded a warning bell for those who had larger orders. They all stopped doing it.

At the meeting that day, Zhang Feng saw Ke Mao Company's people and the pharmacist coming to him with meaningful smiles. He knew these two would definitely contact him secretly.

But Zhang Feng knew that now was too dangerous. If he made a mistake, his fate would be like Li Hounian's.

But Zhang Feng himself understood the system. Moreover, he controlled the finance department. If these cooperating companies directly transferred money to his account, then made a fake ledger, no one else could find out. Even if the annual financial report was released, as long as he made it look good, there would be no loopholes. As long as the process was done secretly, there wouldn't be any surprises for Zhang Feng.

Moreover, someone had previously accused him of making fake accounts. But at that time, Su Nantian personally helped him out. So Zhang Feng thought there was still a chance of侥幸, thinking that if he did this deal, it could succeed and escape.

While Zhang Feng was in a fierce internal struggle, his phone rang again. He picked it up and saw an unknown number. But he didn't understand who was calling—this person wasn't anyone else but the rival of Ke Mao Company, which was another company wanting to cooperate with Tihao Group.

Zhang Feng calmed his thoughts and waited a few seconds before answering the phone.

"Hello, this is Zhang Feng from Tihao Group. Who are you?" Zhang Feng still pretended not to know.

"Director Zhang, hello. I'm from Chuangrong Company. We came to your company today to discuss business. Do you remember?" The pharmacist said on the other end of the phone. Actually, he and Qi Yeyu had already planned to call one after another. At this moment, the two of them were sitting face to face.

"Oh, I remember. What's the matter with you calling me tonight?" Zhang Feng continued to play dumb. He knew perfectly well, as he had just finished talking with Qi Yeyu and now Chuangrong Company's person was calling him. Their intentions were obvious.

"What do you think about this business at Tihao Group?" Compared to Qi Yeyu, the pharmacist took a more roundabout approach.

Generally, businessmen would create several circles when discussing such matters. Qi Yeyu's direct approach was rare.

"Tihao Group's business should be handled carefully. As an employee of Tihao Group, I have this idea. What do you mean?" Zhang Feng continued.

"I think Tihao Group and our Chuangrong Company are both old companies. If we cooperate, it would be a win-win. But I didn't expect that this new company was so bold to compete with us. What do you think?" The pharmacist continued to go around the issue.

"Whether it's a new company or an old one, we mainly look at business ability. Of course, Chuangrong Company has a good reputation and is well-regarded in the industry. Tihao Group will definitely prioritize it. You can rest assured,"

Zhang Feng's polite words were now relayed through the phone to Qi Yeyu.

Qi Yeyu heard this and couldn't help but smile. This was not how Zhang Feng had spoken to him earlier. Indeed, he spoke differently to people and ghosts.

Chapter 437: Temptation

Hearing Zhang Feng's evasive answers, the pharmacist knew that Zhang Feng was being too cautious. If he didn't break it open, Zhang Feng wouldn't respond.

"Director Zhang, I think you can guess my purpose. This business is really what our company needs. You know that there are too many new enterprises now. We old companies can't compare with Tihao Group's size and resources. To establish a foothold, we need partners like you,"

"You're talking as if I can make decisions. I know the market is bad now, and Tihao Group's stability comes from years of accumulation. If you want to cooperate with us, we understand, but there are other competitors now. We can't give you a backdoor," Zhang Feng still played dumb, never taking the initiative to mention this matter. It was one thing for others to ask him for help, but another for himself to bring it up.

After hearing this, the pharmacist silently smiled. Zhang Feng was truly a veteran; he wouldn't budge in this matter.

"Then, Director Zhang, I'll be direct. I hope you can help Chuangrong Company. The price is whatever you want—we'll start with five million, and we can negotiate further,"

The pharmacist was different from Qi Yeyu. He directly offered a price, and this number wasn't small. Moreover, five million was just the starting point.

Upon hearing this number, Zhang Feng's heart gave a jolt. He also heard the latter sentence, knowing that five million was just the minimum price and he could negotiate further. Zhang Feng's heart was instantly shaken.

Who doesn't love money? Everyone in Tihao Group would be tempted by this number. Not just Zhang Feng.

Moreover, this condition could still be negotiated further. If he was willing, he could get more money and even some conditions beneficial to himself.

In fact, Zhang Feng understood why Li Hounian had been tempted. That person had promised to introduce resources from Daocheng. Li Hounian's original plan was to break away from Tihao Group and establish his own. Thus, these resources were too precious for him—not just about money. For people like them, such connections and resources could be converted into greater benefits than money.

At this time, the old company Chuangrong was also allowing him to negotiate freely. This was very tempting for Zhang Feng.

But the pharmacist's words were still echoing in his mind, and he couldn't help but feel a sense of temptation.
