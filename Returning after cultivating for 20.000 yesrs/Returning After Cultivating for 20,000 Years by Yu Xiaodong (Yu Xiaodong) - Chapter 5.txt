At this moment, Lin Qi's eyes turned blood-red with a savage intensity, filled with madness and cruelty. He seemed to see a mountain of gold before him, so close it felt as if he could grasp it. If he completed this task, he would gain a higher status and more wealth than ever before.

This strike was driven by greed, cold-bloodedness, and treachery beyond measure.

But at that moment, Lin Su Yun remained unaware, still smiling as she gazed at Lin Tianyi.

Just as the blade was about to pierce the main artery, his hand could not move an inch further. A powerful hand clamped down on him.

At that very moment, Su Nan Tian heard the sound of a gun's trigger being pulled. He turned his head.

One of the doctors had drawn a dark gun from his white coat, preparing to shoot Lin Yuhu.

Su Nan Tian's reflexes were lightning-fast. He grabbed a golden needle that had not yet been retrieved, twisted his wrist, and shot it forth with the speed of lightning. No one could see it clearly; it was even faster than a bullet by several times.

Bang!

A gunshot echoed. Lin Yuhu's shoulder was wounded, his face filled with terror as he staggered back and sat on a chair.

Looking at the shooter, they were already lying motionless on the ground, obviously dead.

"Father, save me! Save me! Ahhh!" Su Nan Tian tightened his grip on Lin Qi's hand, causing him unbearable pain. Lin Qi howled in agony, kneeling on the ground and begging for help. His dagger had already fallen to the floor.

The room was silent, deathly still.

Apart from the pig-like cries for help, there were no other sounds.

"Lin Qi!"

Everyone snapped out of their trance. The sudden shift in the scene was too fast for them to accept.

Lin Tianyi roared, his eyes wide with fury.

"Why did you do this? What has Lin family done to you?"

"Hahahaha, well said. You still know that, let me tell you."

When Lin YuLong saw his son captured by Su Nan Tian, he knew it was a disaster. His gaze toward Su Nan Tian burned with hatred, wishing to tear him apart limb by limb. He immediately activated the hidden agents he had kept in his heart all his life, but this too had failed.

Yet he was not worried. Today, there was still a high-ranking figure supporting him; otherwise, he would have had the desire but not the courage.

"Hmph. You old bastard, you're still alive and haven't passed on the family head position to me. If I hadn't accidentally overheard you planning to pass it to Lin Yuhu, I would still be in the dark."

"Why should it go to him? I am the eldest son. Why would you give it to him? Besides, he doesn't even have a son. What right does he have to inherit the family's assets?"

"Is it because of some old Taoist's gossip?"

Many years ago, on a stormy night, Lin Tianyi had met a Taoist at the door of his home. The Taoist was unconscious, and Lin Tianyi had saved him out of kindness. It was because of this that the Lin family existed today. But the Taoist's words before he left had remained in Lin Tianyi's heart, never forgotten.

Especially after following the Taoist's instructions and establishing the Lin Group, he had become even more convinced.

The Taoist said: "Your eldest son, Lin YuLong, will destroy the Lin family."

After saying this, the Taoist left without another word.

From then on, Lin Tianyi had never met him again. It was as if he had vanished from the world.

Unluckily, Lin YuLong had overheard it. He didn't believe his father would do this.

But he never imagined...

"You... ah..."

Lin Tianyi looked at Lin YuLong, his body trembling slightly. For a moment, he had no words.

"No words? Old man, your anniversary will be next year."

With that, he pulled out a paper and threw it onto the bed.

"Sign it, then let my son go. Maybe you can still have a whole body for your funeral."

Lin YuLong's face was twisted with rage, his long-held resentment bursting forth in this moment.

"Grandpa, don't sign it. It's your life's work," Lin Su Yun pleaded with trembling hands.

"Nan Tian..."

"Don't worry, nothing will happen."

Lin Su Yun hadn't finished speaking when Su Nan Tian knew what she was about to say. He was puzzled why such a messed-up situation had happened. The old Taoist? He really wanted to know who was playing tricks.

"Old man, you don't need to sign it."

"Kid, because of you, I messed up my plan."

Lin YuLong said angrily.

"Was it your people who were in the mountains before?" Su Nan Tian calmly asked, his mind calm.

"Hmph. I should have guessed it was you. Originally, I wanted to kill you on the road with a car accident. But before I could act, you ran away. You ran pretty fast. Hmph, I knew you had some skills, but you're still not worth anything in front of me."

"Is it because of the person behind you?"

Lin YuLong's pupils narrowed, a flicker of panic flashed in his eyes but quickly disappeared. He had full confidence in the person behind him.

Everyone turned their gaze to the dark spot behind Lin YuLong. They stared for a while but saw nothing.

"Hahahaha..." A figure slowly emerged from the darkness, as if coming from hell. The temperature around them dropped sharply.

A man in his thirties, dressed entirely in black and with a handsome face, appeared under the lights.

His voice was like magic. Listening to it made people shiver with coldness. At that moment, the doctors were all trembling and kneeling on the ground, their fear even more intense after hearing his voice.

When Lin Tianyi saw the man's face, he was instantly shocked. His mouth slightly opened.

"Are you Yun'er's child? Fei?"

"You still remember me, old man. Shut up. You have no right to call her name or me."

The young man was Li Fei, the son of Lin Tianyi in his middle age with a woman. The woman had died because of him, and the child was lost.

"Such a disaster..."

Lin Tianyi sat there in a daze.

"You really wanted to know who the Taoist was, didn't you? I'll tell you. His name is Li Yukun."

Li Fei stared at him, hoping to see him go mad. But after a long time, there was no reaction.

"I should have guessed it was him."

Lin Tianyi smiled bitterly.

Chapter 19: Who is More Arrogant?

"If it weren't for him saving me back then, I might not have seen this moment today. Hahahaha."

Li Fei saw Lin Tianyi's expression and was very happy.

"All of this is your just reward."

Lin YuLong was also shocked. He realized everything had been a setup.

"You...?"

He pointed at Li Fei, speechless for a moment.

"What? You have your chance. Kill him today and you'll be promoted to great heights, even better than what you have now."

"You will gain endless gold and treasures. Countless beauties will be at your side. This is something that countless people could never obtain."

"You have no way out now."

Saying this, he pulled out a gun and handed it to Lin YuLong.

"Kill him, and I'll recommend you to the sect leader of Wusheng Sect. He will take you as his disciple and teach you how to cultivate."

Lin YuLong heard this, his face lit up. He looked at Li Fei as if he hadn't heard it clearly and confirmed again.

"Are you serious?"

"Yes."

"Good."

Su Nan Tian heard the word "cultivate," his eyes lit up. Could there really be a cultivation sect on Earth? Why had he never heard of it?

Even in the Immortal Realm, he hadn't heard of such a thing.

Maybe it was too long? Too long since anyone had ascended. Su Nan Tian's mind was full of questions.

He looked at Lin Yuhu and said,

"Do you not want your son?"

"You'd better let him go. Today, with Li Xianren here, none of you will leave alive."

He had seen the man's power before. It was beyond comprehension. He had never seen a person's strength be so powerful.

"Hahahaha, nonsense. When have I ever feared threats? Do you know what happened to those who threatened me?"

"They all died."

Su Nan Tian's eyes turned cold.

Lin YuLong trembled at Su Nan Tian's cold gaze.

He turned to Li Fei, pleading,

"Li Xianren, could you save my son first?"

"Fool. You didn't complete one task and now want me to help you first? First kill this old man."

"Father, save me! I don't want to die. I also want to cultivate!"

Lin Yuhu thought for a moment, then made up his mind. His son could be reborn, but this chance to cultivate was once in a lifetime. If he missed it, who knew when the next opportunity would come.

"Son, don't blame your father. Blame him instead. If it weren't for this kid, our plan would have already succeeded."

Bang!

The bullet in Lin Qi's eye gradually expanded and then disappeared.

A hole appeared on Li Qi's forehead. His eyes were wide with shock until his death, he couldn't believe his father would shoot him.

At the moment Lin Yuhu fired, Su Nan Tian pushed Lin Qi in front of Grandpa Lin.

Lin Yuhu saw his son die at his hands and was furious.

"You're despicable."

"Who's the one being despicable? You should think carefully who is truly despicable and shameless."

Su Nan Tian coldly replied.

"Yu Hu, put the gun down. It's not too late to turn back. You shouldn't let cultivation blind your eyes. I know it's very tempting, but you can't betray your conscience and do these things."

The scene Lin Tianyi had least wanted to see finally happened.

"Old man, what right do you have to criticize me? All of this is because of you."

With that, he was about to pull the trigger again.

Su Nan Tian lifted Lin Qi's corpse and hurled it at Lin Yuhu.

He followed closely behind.

Bang!

Another shot hit his son's corpse, and he fell to the ground.

Su Nan Tian stepped on the gun that had fallen to the floor, instantly crushing it into dust.

"Do you think breaking a gun is impressive?"

"In front of me, if you're a tiger, lie down. If you're a dragon, coil up."

Li Fei's eyes were full of contempt and even didn't glance at Su Nan Tian.

"Big mouth, try it then."

Su Nan Tian was even more dismissive. This person had just entered the Qi Cultivation stage and dared to be arrogant in front of him, it was pure suicide.

"You're not even worthy to fight with me. This whole performance is ruined by you."

Li Fei waved his hand, and ten more people emerged from the shadows. All were dressed in black, holding swords and knives. The sharp blades were terrifying.

These people were Li Fei's death soldiers, each capable of defeating ten others. They had all spilled blood and were ruthless, like machines of death waiting for orders.

Li Fei hadn't planned to use them. Lin YuLong was too useless, and they were like ants in his eyes.

"Kill!"

With Li Fei's command, dozens of people moved together. Their movements were coordinated and uniform as they rushed toward Su Nan Tian.

Su Nan Tian's lips slightly curled. He stepped with the "Cloud Shadow Step," grabbed a weapon from one of them, and in just a few breaths, each person's knees bled and fell to the ground, unable to stand again.

They were terrified because they hadn't seen his movements at all.

"Big guts, even my people dare to touch."

"You still have time to apologize. Otherwise..."

Li Fei's eyes narrowed, anger boiling. This person was fast, which surprised him a bit. But he didn't sense any spiritual energy from the opponent. He believed that once he moved, he would definitely subdue him. But before that, he wanted to humiliate the opponent.

Su Nan Tian's Immortal Lord Body was beyond Li Fei's ability to perceive. Moreover, he hadn't used spiritual energy; it was all done with his physical strength. If Li Fei knew this, he would have been terrified.

"Otherwise what?"

Su Nan Tian calmly asked. His eyes were deep and calm, watching the man with interest.

He was very curious about how much power Earth's cultivators had. If he could find what he wanted through this person, it might be a good opportunity.

"Then let you see what real cultivation is."

Li Fei calmly said, releasing his aura.

Those who had already been injured and were on the ground couldn't support themselves anymore, all falling to their knees.

The doctors were even more terrified and ran away in panic.

Lin YuLong's face turned paler.

Su Nan Tian's back, Lin Suyun and Lin Tianyi didn't feel any pressure.

"Is that all you have?"

Li Fei heard this and was furious. He vowed to crush him into pieces, but this kid had some skills. He could still speak despite his aura.

Li Fei gathered his strength and launched his strongest punch, pouring all of his spiritual energy. The punch rushed toward Su Nan Tian. As it approached, the person stood there like a fool, and Li Fei's grin became even more sinister, as if he had already seen Su Nan Tian's body torn apart.

Chapter 20: A Very Big Bird

Bang!

Su Nan Tian didn't move at all. This punch landed on him, and he immediately activated the "Qiankun Hui Ling诀" (The Qiankun Accumulation of Spirit Energy). The spiritual energy sent to him was too good to refuse. Immediately, the spiritual energy from Li Fei's punch became obedient and warm all over.

Li Fei saw Su Nan Tian unmoved, thinking it was an illusion. He punched again with another fist, using all his spiritual energy. The opponent still didn't move an inch.

This was like a child hitting someone's chest with small fists.

Li Fei was shocked, staring at Su Nan Tian in disbelief. How could this be real?

He was a cultivation prodigy and had been praised by Li Yukun multiple times. Could he have lied to me? Why, why?

"You didn't eat?"

This voice was a direct insult in Li Fei's ears.

"You're too small for me."

Li Fei cursed and immediately stepped back, creating distance from Su Nan Tian. Seeing that Su Nan Tian didn't chase him, a hidden relief surfaced in his heart.

Su Nan Tian didn't attack. He stood still and watched Li Fei, stepping back to see what tricks he could pull.

Li Fei took out a talisman from his body. He let go of it, and the paper floated in front of him without touching the ground. His hands moved quickly in front of his chest.

After several breaths, his hands stopped moving. He bit his middle finger and blood oozed out.

He shouted, "Die!" His face was twisted with a sinister smile as blood trickled from his mouth.

A finger pressed onto the talisman, and immediately a burst of fire shot out. The flames were fierce like a wild tiger, rushing toward Su Nan Tian.

Everyone gasped in shock at the scene.

How could fire appear out of nowhere?

Lin Suyun shouted, "Be careful!" Her tears flowed uncontrollably.

Su Nan Tian heard Lin Suyun's concern and turned to smile at her.

Lin Suyun saw this expression, feeling both anger and urgency. At this moment, he could still smile? But she hadn't finished speaking when Su Nan Tian was engulfed by the fire.

Li Fei's dozens of black-cloaked soldiers saw this and were terrified. Their legs had already been severed, but their hands still struggled forward to avoid the fire's range. Although they were Li Fei's death soldiers and didn't fear death, they still didn't want to die in vain.

Because this fire had never failed before. They clearly remembered the person who was turned to ashes in the flames.

They knew that whoever dared to challenge their master would be burned to nothing. Their courage had returned, and they felt a slight excitement. Perhaps after this, they would be healed, and if they were brave enough, maybe some rewards would come.

In fact, they had become death soldiers for these rewards and hoped one day to become cultivators like their master.

A few screams echoed. Those who were struggling forward looked back and saw some people crawling slowly behind them. When the fire touched their bodies, it spread quickly across their entire body and within a moment they were reduced to ashes.

Their eyes were full of terror,

But they also saw an even more unbelievable scene.

Su Nan Tian didn't dodge or retreat but took one step after another forward. The fire consumed him, and his clothes had already turned to ashes. But the black figure in the flames continued moving forward.

His steps were steady, without any panic or shouts. This was so unreasonable yet natural to them.

Li Fei saw a black figure moving toward him in the fire, but it wasn't what he had imagined. He hadn't turned to ashes.

Seeing this, his fear reached its peak. His entire body trembled and shook. His hands even struggled to hold the talisman.

At this moment, he realized that this person was definitely a cultivator and one far stronger than himself.

This talisman was Li Yukun's gift to him, the only two he had. It was specially crafted by Li Yukun for low-level cultivators to unleash more than their own power.

He clearly remembered the person who had dared to challenge him before, who was instantly turned into ashes without any resistance.

But this scene could only mean one thing: this person was extremely strong, so strong that he had no resistance.

Just as he thought everything was an illusion, a hand suddenly emerged from the fire and grabbed his talisman. The fire disappeared immediately, even the talisman turned into dust.

Looking at this man who was completely undressed and had no injuries on his skin, with perfect lines, he seemed like a man from hell.

Su Nan Tian was slightly angry. This guy had burned his clothes, giving him a cold breeze on his back.

He tried to take out a set of clothes from his storage bracelet but realized he didn't have one.

Su Nan Tian kicked Li Fei, sending him several meters away and embedding him in the wall. He was motionless and unconscious.

Su Nan Tian didn't kill him immediately because he still had some questions to ask.

He stood there quietly without turning around.

In fact, the fight from start to finish lasted no more than a minute.

Behind them, some people were happy while others had pale faces. None of them could believe it. The dozens of black-cloaked people on the ground, some had already fainted while others struggled to live. They wouldn't survive long anyway. Their master was still unknown, and what about them?

Lin Suyun saw Su Nan Tian alive and was very happy. But her mouth formed an "O" shape, staring in disbelief at the naked man before her. His posture was tall and his lines were clear, making her face flush with red.

She ran to another room to fetch a piece of clothing. Her face turned even redder as she rushed back to Su Nan Tian.

"Here, take this."

Lin Suyun lowered her head and handed the clothes to him.

Su Nan Tian heard Lin Suyun's voice and immediately turned around, taking the clothes.

"You pervert!"

As she handed over the clothes, her line of sight was just opened. She looked in that direction and saw a huge bird, very large. Lin Suyun immediately turned around, her face burning red and scolded him.

"Go away!"

Su Nan Tian smiled awkwardly, wanting to say something but stopped himself.
