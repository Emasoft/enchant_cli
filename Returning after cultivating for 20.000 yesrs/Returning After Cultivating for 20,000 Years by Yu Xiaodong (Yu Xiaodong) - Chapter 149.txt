“Hurry! Go check!”

When Wu Chuan heard the assistant say this, he immediately spoke. His anger made him slam the table again. He thought about how he had been deceived by Su Nantian, despite being a shrewd hunter all his life.

He had always prided himself on being a clever predator, yet he had been outwitted by an eagle who pecked his eyes.

This failure was not only a personal defeat but also an indelible stain on his record.

Such fury made it impossible for Wu Chuan to remain calm.

When he spoke these words, his teeth were clenched in rage, and his face was grim. His anger made everyone hesitate to approach him.

Nan Gong Ping sat nearby, and when he heard them mention Su Nantian, he felt utterly confused. He could not grasp what they were talking about.

When Wu Chuan and the assistant hurried out, Nan Gong Ping immediately stood up again.

“Sir? What’s going on? Why is this connected to Su Nantian?”

Nan Gong Ping urgently questioned, his mind filled with bewilderment and speculation.

“Ah! There’s no time for a detailed explanation, Master Nan. If you don’t mind, just come and see for yourself!”

The assistant replied quickly upon hearing Nan Gong Ping’s confusion, then hurried ahead to guide Wu Chuan.

“Follow me.”

At this moment, Wu Chuan suddenly spoke, then gazed deeply at Nan Gong Ping.

Wu Chuan now thought of another possibility.

Could it be that Su Nantian’s visit to Wu You’er was actually ordered by the Nan Gong family? His earlier promise of cooperation had been a ruse, and he had never truly meant it.

As he thought this, Wu Chuan cast another glance at Nan Gong Ping, his mind filled with endless suspicions.

Wu Chuan even suspected that this mission was secretly ordered by the Nan Gong family; otherwise, why had Nan Gong Ping repeatedly mentioned Wu You’er in front of him?

This thought deepened his doubts.

Yet he was well acquainted with Nan Gong Ping’s character and abilities. Upon careful observation, he saw only shock and bewilderment in Nan Gong Ping’s expression, with no signs of deceit.

At this thought, Wu Chuan could not help but question whether Nan Gong Ping had hidden his true nature so well or if he had been playing a fool all along, with this clumsy demeanor merely a mask.

But now was not the time to dwell on such matters. The immediate priority was to intercept Su Nantian before he escaped, for there would be no second chance.

After speaking these words, Wu Chuan suppressed his suspicions about Nan Gong Ping and strode out without looking back.

Nan Gong Ping, hearing their words and seeing their expressions, still felt lost in confusion.

After a moment of hesitation, he hurried after them to see what was happening.

But the thought that Su Nantian had become involved in this matter left him unsettled and anxious.

What was going on?

Why did he now feel Su Nantian was so unfamiliar, as if he had hidden countless secrets all along?

As they hurried toward the safehouse, the security guards at the entrance were still desperately trying to open the door.

Unfortunately, Wu Chuan had already stated that this door was incredibly sturdy and made of advanced materials. Even a cannonball would struggle to break it open, let alone the efforts of a few security personnel.

Thus, when Wu Chuan and his group arrived, the door remained intact without a single change.

“Master, Assistant Li.”

The security chief saw Wu Chuan approaching and felt his heart sink. He lowered his head, though fear gripped him, yet he could only greet them respectfully: “My subordinates are useless; we have failed to open the door.”

After saying this, the security chief immediately lowered his head further, too afraid to utter another word.

“Fools! How long have you been trying without opening the door!”

The assistant, seeing this, immediately scolded sharply. He also glanced at Wu Chuan anxiously, fearing he would be angry.

“Enough.”

Wu Chuan had already composed himself on the way here. He had lived through much in his lifetime, and while Su Nantian’s betrayal shocked him, it paled in comparison to the ruthless act of eliminating his own brother.

“Do you not know the structure of this door? What use is there in scolding him now?”

Wu Chuan spoke softly, then warned the assistant with a glance.

“Yes, Master is right.”

The assistant immediately fell silent. He had always been performing for Wu Chuan’s benefit; now that Wu Chuan said he would not dwell on the matter, he naturally cowered and dared to say nothing.

“Hmph.”

Wu Chuan nodded, then looked at the security chief: “Go to the armory and retrieve all weapons. Distribute them among every security officer, then surround this place.”

Wu Chuan issued the order to the security personnel. After speaking, he let out a cold laugh: “This time, I shall catch him like a fish in a jar. He won’t have a chance to escape!”

Daring to outwit him?

Wu Chuan would see whether Su Nantian had the ability to do so!

He would not let him off lightly. He would make Su Nantian remember the consequences of defying him forever.

“Yes, Master!”

The security personnel, upon hearing Wu Chuan’s order, immediately lifted their heads. Their eyes flashed with a brief shock.

The armory! That meant real weapons.

In other words, Wu Chuan had no intention of letting Su Nantian leave alive!

“What?”

Wu Chuan saw the security chief’s expression and raised an eyebrow in question.

“No, I’ll go right away!”

The security chief immediately shook his head and lowered his gaze. He dared not meet Wu Chuan’s eyes any longer. Then he selected two teams to accompany him to the armory.

“What about us?”

At this moment, the assistant cautiously asked, his concern evident.

“We?”

Wu Chuan raised an eyebrow again. His previous warmth vanished, revealing no trace of mercy. He coldly spoke and drew the gun at his waist with a click, loading it.

“Hmph. Naturally, we’ll stay here and wait for him.”

Wu Chuan let out a cold laugh. His lips curled in mockery: “I’ll see what tricks he still has up his sleeve!”

This time, he would ensure Su Nantian never returned!

Chapter 746: Turning the Tables

The assistant suddenly widened his eyes, understanding Wu Chuan’s meaning. He nodded quickly: “Master is wise! For someone who dares to stir up trouble in the Wu family, there’s no better way than to kill one and scare the rest!”

“Are you going to kill Su Nantian?”

Although Nan Gong Ping was still confused about what had happened, he could understand this sentence.

Nan Gong Ping did not yet know what Su Nantian had done, and he still regarded him as a mentor and friend. Naturally, he could not stand by while Su Nantian was killed. So he immediately asked:

“Master Nan, this is a matter of the Wu family. It’s unnecessary for an outsider like you to interfere.”

Upon hearing this, Wu Chuan looked at Nan Gong Ping meaningfully before mocking him.

This sentence clearly distanced everything, and the words themselves directly excluded Nan Gong Ping. Otherwise, he would not have used the sensitive terms “family matter” and “outsider.”

After saying this, Wu Chuan let out another cold laugh: “However, I do have one thing to settle with your Nan Gong family after this!”

“What do you mean, Master Wu?”

Nan Gong Ping frowned and looked at Wu Chuan with displeasure.

He had just called it a family matter, but the latter half clearly implicated the Nan Gong family.

“Hmph. Do I need to explain it?”

Wu Chuan, far superior in status to Nan Gong Ping, heard the question and showed no change in expression. Instead, he let out a cold laugh: “Your Nan Gong family’s security guards entered our safehouse and took our patriarch hostage. Tell me, does this have nothing to do with your Nan Gong family?”

Wu Chuan’s words were sharp and cutting, like a blade carving deep into Nan Gong Ping.

“Exactly! Perhaps this was your family’s order!”

At this moment, the assistant caught Wu Chuan’s glance and immediately understood. He stepped forward and scolded Nan Gong Ping sharply.

Some words were too bold, but Wu Chuan’s status prevented him from speaking openly. However, as an assistant, the blame would fall on him for being impulsive.

Thus, after understanding Wu Chuan’s signal, the assistant immediately poured blame onto Nan Gong Ping.

“You! You!”

They were truly a pair of scoundrels! Black could be twisted into white!

Nan Gong Ping’s face turned dark. He suddenly regretted coming alone; if he had brought Nan Gong Yuyan, he wouldn’t have been left without a defense.

“I could also accuse you of deliberately taking Su Nantian hostage to frame our Nan Gong family!”

Nan Gong Ping clenched his fists and retaliated.

The Nan Gong family was not one to be trifled with.

He had long felt that something was wrong with today’s events, and everything seemed suspicious.

Perhaps it was Wu family who had set up a trap to entrap Su Nantian!

At this thought, Nan Gong Ping glared at Wu Chuan: “I knew you wouldn’t cooperate so easily. I never expected you to set a trap here and ambush us!”

With the wetland bidding competition approaching, if the Nan Gong family encountered problems now, they would become targets of public scorn!

Wu Chuan had truly dug a deep pit and calculated precisely.

“Silence! Our master would never do such things. This must be your Nan Gong family’s attempt to frame us! Now that we’ve uncovered Su Nantian as the pawn, you’re shouting!”

At this moment, the assistant glanced at Wu Chuan and understood his signal. He immediately replied to Nan Gong Ping.

“You!”

Nan Gong Ping was about to explode; he had never expected anyone to twist the truth so brazenly and with such a sharp tongue.

“Enough. Now we are both holding our ground, and neither can convince the other.”

At this moment, Wu Chuan interrupted their argument. He continued: “Since Master Nan is so certain that this has nothing to do with your Nan Gong family, then when Su Nantian comes out, we’ll know who is at fault.”

“Good! The Nan Gong family stands upright and holds its head high. There’s nothing to fear!”

Nan Gong Ping could not withstand the provocation. Upon hearing Wu Chuan’s provocation, he fell into the trap without realizing it and even unintentionally defended his family.

“Hmph. Who is right or wrong will be decided when Su Nantian appears.”

Wu Chuan let out another cold laugh and continued: “I just hope Master Nan will give me an explanation later. Otherwise, I won’t back down from your Nan Gong family!”

Outside the commotion, Su Nantian and Wu You’er were in chaos inside the safehouse.

Su Nantian had underestimated Wu Chuan’s preparations. He didn’t know where he had found so many materials, but after attempting to break through the barriers and walls, he realized that his efforts had been in vain.

Not only was there no hole, but even a crack was absent.

“We’ll have to go through the door.”

After a moment of contemplation, Su Nantian announced.

He had always known that Wu Chuan would ambush him at the door.

But now, with only one path left, they had no choice but to take it.

They simply hoped for a chance at survival and a sliver of hope.

“I’m sorry, Su Nantian. It’s all my fault.”

Wu You’er suddenly spoke, her face pale and defeated. “If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t be trapped here.”

“What are you talking about?”

Su Nantian saw Wu You’er again and once more took all the blame upon himself. He felt both amused and helpless, but when he thought deeper, he felt a pang of sympathy for Wu You’er.

“I’ve told you before: this is my mission. There’s no such thing as being a burden.”

Su Nantian placed his hand on Wu You’er’s shoulder, signaling her to look up. He continued: “Besides, all the blame lies with Wu Chuan. You are also a victim; how can you be at fault?”

“But I…”

Wu You’er bit her lip, looking anxiously at Su Nantian.

“No buts.”

Su Nantian cut her off immediately and continued: “Remember this: I will take you out, and after that, you can live the life you desire.”

He would rescue Wu You’er no matter what and ensure she did not suffer Wu Chuan’s torment.

“Can I really do that?”

Living her own life?

When Wu You’er heard this, she felt a flicker of hope. But more than that was her unease and worry.

Chapter 747: A Battle

“Of course.”

Su Nantian knew Wu You’er’s doubts and immediately gave her a firm answer, making her believe in herself.

“Come on, You’er. Since we can’t hide anymore, let’s leave here in a dignified manner.”

Su Nantian continued. After all, this direct confrontation was unavoidable.

Why not end it quickly and take Wu You’er out sooner?

As he spoke, Su Nantian slowly extended his hand toward Wu You’er, signaling her to place hers in his.

Wu You’er hesitated for a moment but met Su Nantian’s determined gaze. Her eyes became resolute, and she slowly placed her hand in his: “Okay.”

Su Nantian clasped Wu You’er’s hand and gently squeezed it, giving her strength.

“Stay behind me.”

Now that he had decided to confront Wu Chuan directly, Su Nantian wasted no time. After calming Wu You’er’s emotions, he prepared to go out and face Wu Chuan.

Wu You’er, encouraged by Su Nantian, now felt full of courage. She looked at him with complete trust and followed him out in unison.

“Boom!”

At this moment, the safehouse door was pushed open from within.

The security guards stationed at the entrance were all highly alert. Upon hearing the sound, they immediately aimed their guns at the door.

When Su Nantian emerged, he saw a dense crowd of armed men.

Wu Chuan immediately straightened up. He narrowed his eyes and let out a cold laugh before speaking to Su Nantian: “So it’s you. You’ve been hiding your identity from me this whole time. Now that I’ve known nothing about you, you must be quite pleased with yourself, right?”

Wu Chuan had tried to suppress his anger, but upon meeting Su Nantian, he could not help but feel intense rage.

His fists clenched tightly, and his other hand gripped the trigger. His tone was mocking, filled with hatred for Su Nantian.

Su Nantian responded to Wu Chuan’s words with a smile and said: “Not much. There’s nothing to be proud of, after all, deceiving you was too easy.”

Su Nantian’s words were clearly mocking Wu Chuan. This statement openly showed his contempt for Wu Chuan.

As a result, Wu Chuan’s expression darkened further and his anger escalated.

“Good! Very good! Even at the end, you still dare to be defiant!”

Wu Chuan had never been so openly insulted before. His face turned green, and his fists clenched even tighter. He longed to devour Su Nantian alive.

“Rude!”

Standing beside Wu Chuan, the assistant immediately shouted at Su Nantian: “Do you know who you are? How dare you speak to Master like this! I think you’ve gone mad!”

The assistant glared at Su Nantian. He thought about his own repeated failures and how Su Nantian had treated him like a fool, which made him even angrier.

After all, no one liked being tricked, especially by the same person repeatedly.

Just thinking about those past events made the assistant want to tear Su Nantian apart right then and there.

“Enough! Just start the fight. No more nonsense.”

Su Nantian had no intention of wasting time anymore. He wanted to end this quickly and take Wu You’er back to report.

Then he would let Wu You’er live a completely free life, no longer bound by anyone.

Su Nantian spoke coldly and looked at Wu Chuan with an icy gaze.

“You!”

Wu Chuan had not expected Su Nantian to speak so boldly even with so many guns aimed at him. His expression grew darker.

He felt that he had failed to suppress Su Nantian and had lost face in front of his subordinates.

At this moment, Nan Gong Ping stepped forward and asked Su Nantian: “Nantian, what’s going on? I don’t understand anything. Why did you take Miss You’er and fight against Wu Chuan?”

When he saw Su Nantian emerge, Nan Gong Ping still leaned toward trusting him. He always believed that Wu Chuan was the one who had schemed against Su Nantian.

So it was because of this that Su Nantian had fallen into the trap, but now seeing Su Nantian emerge, Nan Gong Ping’s certainty was shaken.

He even felt that the Su Nantian before him was completely unfamiliar, not at all like the one he had known.

This was why Nan Gong Ping could not help but ask Su Nantian for an explanation.

“Master Nan, that’s how it is.”

At this moment, Su Nantian looked at Nan Gong Ping and added: “I’m sorry.”

“Sorry? Are you admitting that you’ve been deceiving me all along and also tricking our Nan Gong family?”

Nan Gong Ping heard Su Nantian’s apology and exploded. He then glared at Su Nantian with anger, unable to believe what he had said.

And Nan Gong Ping could not accept that he had been deceived by Su Nantian for so long!

What humiliation and anger was this?

But Su Nantian withdrew his gaze without answering. He paused for a moment and then turned to Wu Chuan, speaking coldly: “Wu Chuan, attack. I must take Wu You’er with me today.”

Su Nantian thought that since they had already torn off the mask, there was no need to act anymore.

So he directly stated his purpose: after all, his mission had always been to rescue Wu You’er. As for the others, he didn’t care and didn’t want to play games with them anymore.

With this said, Wu Chuan no longer had any reason to tolerate Su Nantian.

He let out a cold laugh and said: “Good! Very good! Daring to provoke me, you truly have courage!”

Now that the other had spoken so clearly, Wu Chuan no longer intended to give Su Nantian any chance of survival.

“Attack! No matter if he lives or dies, just get rid of him!”

Wu Chuan had originally planned to capture Su Nantian and keep him for entertainment. But now he changed his mind; he would kill Su Nantian to completely eliminate this black mark and prevent anyone from criticizing his mistake.

Thus, at this moment, Wu Chuan coldly ordered the security personnel to show no mercy.

Chapter 748: A Step Behind

“Master? Are we not going to capture him alive? We haven’t yet discovered who his master is, have we?”

Upon hearing Wu Chuan’s decision to kill Su Nantian immediately, the assistant was stunned and quickly asked: “Killing him like this might not be good.”

“Hmph. Do you think he would cooperate and tell us anything if we captured him?”

Wu Chuan responded with a cold laugh.

“Probably not.”

The assistant thought for a moment before answering Wu Chuan: “After all, Su Nantian dared to provoke Master directly. It’s clear he won’t back down.”

“Thus, there is no need to keep his life.”

Wu Chuan responded with another cold laugh. The assistant understood Wu Chuan’s meaning and realized that today, Wu Chuan was determined to severely punish Su Nantian. He would not give him a chance at survival.

“What about Miss You’er? If the security personnel accidentally hurt her, it would be a problem.”

At this moment, the assistant thought of another point and nervously said to Wu Chuan.

Su Nantian’s death was fine, but Miss You’er still had some value.

“Su Nantian intruded into the Wu family and killed Miss You’er. I had no choice but to take over as the new head of the family and represent the Wu family at the wetland bidding competition.”

Wu Chuan let out a cold laugh and spoke slowly.

At first, the assistant did not understand why Wu Chuan suddenly said this, but as he listened further, he sensed something different and immediately widened his eyes.

“What do you think of this explanation?”

Wu Chuan directly looked into the assistant’s eyes and smiled.

“Master is wise! This is truly the best reason!”

The assistant immediately raised his thumb and sincerely praised Wu Chuan. This was indeed Wu Chuan’s brilliance, as there was no more reasonable reason to cover up this matter and successfully take over.

Moreover, there was another advantage.

Su Nantian was a member of the Nan Gong family. If this were revealed, the Nan Gong family would be implicated and could not escape blame.

This was truly a threefold victory!

“Master is wise!”

The assistant immediately praised again, looking at Wu Chuan with admiration.

“Since that’s the case, attack! Remember, no survivors.”

Wu Chuan’s eyes gleamed with a hint of satisfaction before he gave the order.

The security personnel received the command and immediately responded in unison: “Yes, Master!”

They had been troubled by Su Nantian’s actions for days. They hadn’t eaten well or slept soundly, and now they were almost causing a big mess.

So when Wu Chuan said they didn’t need to spare Su Nantian’s life, they were all eager to kill him in retaliation.

“Su Nantian! Don’t worry about me! With your abilities, you should be able to leave alone!”

Upon hearing Wu Chuan’s order, Wu You’er felt extremely anxious. She thought that Wu Chuan was determined to kill Su Nantian despite the risk, and she felt her heart race.

It was her problem; it didn’t matter if she died, but she couldn’t let Su Nantian be caught in the crossfire! This had nothing to do with Su Nantian at all!

Wu You’er absolutely did not want to see Su Nantian die because of her.

“Leave! Su Nantian! Don’t bother with me anymore!”

Seeing the security personnel had started to attack, Wu You’er felt even more anxious. She kept urging Su Nantian to leave and not bother with her.

“What are you talking about?”

Su Nantian immediately took the safehouse door and used it to block the security personnel’s bullets. He answered Wu You’er: “Don’t say that again. I said I would take you out, and I will.”

At this point, Su Nantian paused for a moment and looked back at Wu You’er: “Do you not believe in my abilities?”

These bullets were nothing to Su Nantian. But Wu You’er was merely a mortal; she could not withstand this.

That was why Su Nantian felt some hesitation.

“I believe in you.”

Wu You’er, seeing Su Nantian fighting for her safety, immediately nodded and answered: “But I don’t want to be a burden because of…”

“Believe in me.”

At this moment, Su Nantian interrupted Wu You’er again and said: “Go back to the safehouse first. I’ll come for you after I deal with these people.”

These bullets were really a problem, but Su Nantian didn’t care. However, Wu You’er couldn’t handle it. Because she was here, Su Nantian felt somewhat constrained.

“Go in!”

Su Nantian saw Wu You’er still hesitating and reminded her again.

“What about you?”

Wu You’er shook her head, clenching her fists and shouting at Su Nantian.

“Go in!”

Su Nantian saw Wu You’er still wouldn’t listen to him and felt his head throb. He didn’t wait for her approval but pushed her in and closed the door again.

After dealing with these annoying security personnel, he would come back for Wu You’er.

“Hmph! You sent her in, but now you’re unarmed.”

At this moment, Wu Chuan let out a cold laugh and signaled the security personnel to stop.

No one fired anymore, but the entrance was still aimed at Su Nantian standing at the safehouse door.

“Yes.”

Su Nantian remained unafraid, even letting out a light laugh and saying: “But what does it matter?”

These few words conveyed Su Nantian’s elegance and nonchalance. His emotions even infected the others, making Wu Chuan momentarily stunned by his indifferent tone.

“Good! Since you are so arrogant, I won’t show mercy!”

Wu Chuan spoke angrily. He felt that by having them stop, he was not mocking Su Nantian but being mocked in return.

Thinking of this, Wu Chuan’s anger burned even more fiercely: “Attack!”

He would shoot Su Nantian to pieces and end his arrogance!

The security personnel had been waiting for Wu Chuan’s command. Upon hearing it, they immediately rushed to attack, firing bullets like rain at Su Nantian.

“Pfft.”

Su Nantian let out a light scoff and made no attempt to dodge. He simply lifted his foot and kicked the bullets that had fallen on the ground back up.

These bullets collided with those fired by them, creating a loud explosion in the air.

Yet not one bullet reached Su Nantian.

Chapter 749: A Crisis

“Good heavens, is he even human?”

The security personnel saw Su Nantian use this trick to return all the bullets and remain unharmed, their expressions filled with shock.

No one believed that this was something a human could do; it completely shattered their previous understanding.

In an instant, all the security personnel were in disarray. Their eyes changed completely; no one believed that Su Nantian was so powerful!

“This… this…”

Even Wu Chuan showed a look of shock, clearly not expecting Su Nantian to be so formidable.

Not fearing bullets at all?

Thinking of this, Wu Chuan’s expression darkened further. He now understood why Su Nantian had dared to act so boldly in front of him; it was because he was confident.

Otherwise, how could he have come alone and caused trouble in the Wu family?

“Master, what should we do? This Su Nantian is really a ghost! He’s not even human!”

At this moment, the assistant looked at Wu Chuan anxiously and asked for his guidance.

Thinking about how Su Nantian had defied all logic by simply kicking the bullets back and remaining unharmed, the assistant felt his hair stand on end.

This was too strange!

He had been by Wu Chuan’s side for years, seen many people with power and countless strange events. But he had never encountered anyone like Su Nantian before!

What an incredible ability this was!

The more the assistant thought about it, the darker his expression became. His fear of Su Nantian deepened.

“Master, perhaps you should go back first. This Su Nantian is too strange and has unique abilities. He might really harm you. Master should go to a safe place to hide!”

The assistant thought of this and immediately advised Wu Chuan.

After all, as the backbone of the entire Wu family, if Wu Chuan were to be harmed, they would all become scattered and lost. This was absolutely unacceptable.

Thinking of this, the assistant mustered his courage and continued to advise Wu Chuan: “Master, you should go to a safe place first! We all rely on your orders!”

“Enough! You don’t need to say more. I’m not going anywhere!”

Wu Chuan understood the importance of the assistant’s words, but he had already made up his mind. He would not let this matter go unaddressed, and he would definitely not run away at this critical moment.

“Silence! You have time to think of ways to deal with Su Nantian!”

Wu Chuan saw the assistant’s anxious expression and his continued attempts to persuade him, so he furrowed his brow and interrupted him.

The assistant saw Wu Chuan’s determined attitude and could only swallow all his advice.

After all, no matter how much he advised Wu Chuan, it was useless now. He might as well save his strength.

“Hmph! Wu Chuan, you cannot contain me!”

At this moment, Su Nantian noticed the security personnel’s panic and even saw Wu Chuan’s face show a rare hint of unease. This made Su Nantian feel even more confident.

“Dare to speak my name! You are truly audacious!”

Wu Chuan heard Su Nantian call him by name and saw his bold, fearless arrogance. His anger deepened further, and he longed to crush Su Nantian.

“Open fire! Continue shooting! I don’t believe he can withstand this barrage!”

At this moment, Wu Chuan angrily ordered. Upon hearing this, all the security personnel immediately pulled the trigger. They were now determined to fight Su Nantian.

Unfortunately, their expected scene did not materialize; Su Nantian was not killed by the gunfire.

All their eyes saw Su Nantian place his hands in front of him, doing something unknown. The air before him seemed to solidify suddenly, and the bullets flying from all directions were caught mid-air without approaching Su Nantian.

“Good heavens!”

One of the security personnel could not help but exclaim in shock and immediately took a step back.

“Is he even human?”

Another security personnel also exclaimed, looking at Su Nantian in disbelief: “No, this can’t be human. How can we fight him?”

He was not afraid of fists or feet, and he wasn’t even afraid of bullets!

And now that they were all here, they could not move Su Nantian even a little. This made their confidence vanish instantly; no one was willing to accept this reality.

“Silence!”
