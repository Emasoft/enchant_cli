Two days later, Su Nantian arrived at Dihao Group and convened a management meeting.

Seated in the central position, clad in formal attire, Su Nantian addressed those below: “The neighboring island city will hold a bidding session. The project is highly suitable for Dihao Group, and the profit this time is substantial. However, the competitors are also quite formidable.”

At this point, the large screen ahead began displaying information about the bidding session.

Su Nantian continued: “Please review the following PowerPoint presentation—it contains the basic details of this bidding session. This is the first one I’ve prepared since taking over Dihao Group. If we succeed in this bid, it will secure a major project with significant profits. I hope the key managers here can attend in person.”

He then pointed to the financial director, human resources director, and business director. “Zhang Feng, Wang Ruichang, Li Hounian—three of you must accompany me. The rest will continue managing your respective departments.”

The three nodded without uttering a word.

Subsequently, Su Nantian spoke with Wen Ran about other matters concerning Dihao Group before dismissing the meeting.

“You three should return and prepare. We’ll depart immediately tomorrow. This bidding session is crucial, so bringing you along was to ensure your support. After all, it’s my first bidding session since taking over Dihao Group, and this one is of great significance for the group’s development and profits.”

After the meeting concluded, Su Nantian called the three aside.

“Chairman, I’ll ensure this bid is won for you,” said Li Hounian, the business director responsible for external partnerships.

“Indeed, Chairman, rest assured,” added Wang Ruichang, the human resources director.

Standing nearby was Zhang Feng, the financial director who had previously been falsely accused. He said nothing but nodded in agreement.

“Good, with the three of you, I feel at ease. Return and prepare. We’ll depart for the island city tomorrow.” After saying this, Su Nantian patted their shoulders and left with Wen Ran.

“How do you think this plan will work? I don’t see anything unusual about the three of them,” Wen Ran whispered to Su Nantian.

“At this point, it’s too early to tell. Their true colors will reveal themselves once we arrive in the island city. Moreover, I’ve already made contact—Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yexu will assist us.” Su Nantian reassured Wen Ran.

This time, Su Nantian had set a trap, orchestrating a false bidding session in the neighboring island city. He also instructed Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yexu to impersonate high-ranking officials from competing companies.

Their roles would soon become clear, allowing the three to vanish without a trace.

Furthermore, Su Nantian had chosen the neighboring island city as the location because it was a tourist destination. He also wished to take Wen Ran there for some relaxation.

The recent events had been excessively stressful for Wen Ran, not only due to his complicated relationship with the Wen family but also because of Leng Zhifei’s kidnapping. Su Nantian felt it was time to take Wen Ran out for a break.

This opportunity allowed them to visit the neighboring city, and since the bidding session involved no complex matters, it would likely conclude swiftly without incident.

Moreover, Su Nantian felt he deserved a break.

The next morning, Su Nantian and his group departed. He and Wen Ran traveled in one vehicle, while the three others took separate cars.

The scene appeared grand, with several vehicles forming a line on the highway heading toward the island city.

However, Zhang Feng, Wang Ruichang, and Li Hounian remained unaware of what awaited them ahead.

Chapter 417: The Bidding Session

They arrived at the neighboring island city in just over two hours.

“Rooms have been reserved. Let’s rest briefly first. Later, we’ll visit the bidding site to gather information. The session will last about two days; we can inspect the situation this afternoon,” Su Nantian told them.

After Zhang Feng, Wang Ruichang, and Li Hounian nodded in agreement, Su Nantian clapped his hands to signal free movement.

He immediately contacted Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yexu, who confirmed the bidding site was set up and that they were prepared. The afternoon plan could commence at any time.

After a brief rest, Su Nantian and Wen Ran led the others to the bidding site.

The session was held in the hotel’s conference room, making it convenient for them. Most participants also stayed at the same hotel to quickly obtain bidding information.

Experienced attendees knew that the bidding staff resided in the same hotel, and those with means could glean beneficial information from them.

On the first day of the bidding session, companies arrived to learn about the details and submit their documents.

Su Nantian and Wen Ran feigned submitting Dihao Group’s materials before telling the others, “Today is about gathering intelligence. We’ll go our separate ways.”

Zhang Feng and the others nodded in understanding before parting from Su Nantian and Wen Ran.

“Hey, why did you let them go? How can we know who’s up to something?” Wen Ran asked, puzzled. He believed they should have kept a close watch on the three.

Su Nantian shook his head and smiled, “If I don’t let them go, how will I know who runs the farthest? Trust me, Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yexu are already in place. It won’t take long before we see results.”

Su Nantian spoke with confidence.

Wen Ran scoffed, “How do you know they’ll fall into your trap? If they’re deep undercover, this plan would be wasted.”

He pointed to the bidding site and said, “You’ve invested so much effort into this session. If no one bites, it’ll be a complete waste of time and resources. Plus, you’ve publicly declared this as your first bidding session since taking over Dihao Group. If it fails, it’ll harm your reputation.”

Yet Su Nantian remained confident. “If this were in Hangcheng, they might not bite. But here, in the island city, they’ll feel safe and likely fall for it if someone lures them. Leave the rest to me; we’ll reap the benefits.”

After receiving Su Nantian’s approval, Zhang Feng, Wang Ruichang, and Li Hounian wandered through the bidding session.

One among them harbored ill intentions, while the others genuinely sought to prove themselves through this opportunity.

After Dihao Group’s new president took over, Su Nantian seemed to distrust everyone. Yet this was precisely the moment for these executives to climb higher.

The more senior they became, the harder it was to advance—reaching a high level made further progress difficult. However, Dihao Group’s recent leadership changes reignited their hopes.

Each of the three operated independently, seeking to uncover insider details and connect with bidding staff. Even if unnoticed, they were willing to pay for information.

Meanwhile, Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yexu had already prepared in the bidding session. They played the roles of executives from competing companies, aiming to lure Zhang Feng and the others.

If one among them indeed harbored ill intentions—just as Wen Ran suspected—they would surely collaborate with either Qi Yinzhen or Qi Yexu, exposing their true colors.

At this moment, Qi Yinzhen, dressed in formal attire, approached Zhang Feng.

“Hello, are you the representative of Dihao Group?” Qi Yinzhen asked.

“Oh, hello. I’m Zhang Feng, the financial director of Dihao Group. May I ask who you are?” Zhang Feng replied politely, as was customary in such settings. Even among competitors, surface courtesy was essential to avoid appearing unrefined.

“I’m the representative of Boyuan Technology, also participating in this bidding session,” Qi Yinzhen said with a smile, handing over his fake business card. Boyuan Technology was an illusion—its details were entirely fabricated by Su Nantian to test for internal traitors.

“Oh, so you’re a local company in the island city,” Zhang Feng remarked after examining the card.

This was Su Nantian’s deliberate setup. Boyuan Technology was a shell company with no real operations, its name and details appearing online but all fabricated for the bidding session’s purpose.

“We’re very interested in this project, but we’ve noticed Dihao Group is a strong competitor. If you’re interested, perhaps we could discuss it privately. You understand,” Qi Yinzhen added, patting Zhang Feng’s shoulder before leaving with a smile.

Meanwhile, Qi Yexu played the same role in another company, engaging Wang Ruichang. The process was identical, and Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yexu had no fear of exposure. The more clandestine the act, the less likely it was to be discovered or discussed among others.

Those intending to transfer Dihao Group’s assets would keep it strictly secret, while the other two, though without ill intentions, found the matter too sensitive to risk exposure.

Chapter 418: Free Movement

While Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yexu tested Dihao Group’s three executives, Su Nantian feigned interest in the bidding session with Wen Ran.

Yet he knew the entire session was a farce, with everyone arranged by him.

As Su Nantian and Wen Ran discussed the fake bidding documents, they noticed Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yexu had returned.

Seeing them pass by, both gave Su Nantian a meaningful glance—indicating they had completed his task and privately contacted Zhang Feng, Wang Ruichang, and Li Hounian.

Su Nantian smiled slightly and whispered to Wen Ran, “Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yexu have already made contact with them. They’ve also extended an olive branch. We just need to wait; the one with hidden motives will surely respond.”

Su Nantian’s trap was simple, almost too obvious for anyone with a little wit to detect. Yet he had anticipated this and acted boldly because he was certain these three would never uncover it.

They believed Su Nantian had just taken over Dihao Group and needed to establish authority. This bidding session was the perfect opportunity, so they remained oblivious.

Another reason was that they were unaware their treachery had already been discovered by Wen Ran.

Everything now unfolded under Su Nantian’s control, waiting for someone to slip up.

Additionally, Su Nantian had installed surveillance in Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yexu’s rooms. If any Dihao Group executive approached them, Su Nantian and Wen Ran would watch everything clearly from their room.

After learning Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yexu were ready, Zhang Feng, Wang Ruichang, and Li Hounian soon returned.

“How did it go? Did you find any information?” Su Nantian asked feigning concern. He knew the session had no real staff, so their attempts to find internal information were futile.

Zhang Feng and Li Hounian shook their heads, stating they hadn’t found any staff or details.

But Wang Ruichang’s response differed.

“Chairman, President, I think I found someone related to the bidding session. I plan to invite her for dinner tonight to extract some information.”

Wen Ran and Su Nantian exchanged glances, their eyes conveying unspoken messages. Yet they couldn’t voice their thoughts aloud.

“Fine, go ahead. Anything beneficial for the bidding session is acceptable,” Su Nantian waved dismissively. He couldn’t stop him; otherwise, it would seem suspicious. Who wouldn’t want their group to win the bid?

“Alright, I think there’s no critical information left today. The first day was just about submitting documents and basic details. You can move around freely. I’ll meet you again tomorrow.”

Su Nantian dismissed the three, giving them time to approach Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yexu.

After Su Nantian and Wen Ran separated from the three, Wen Ran remarked, “Don’t you think Wang Ruichang seems suspicious? There’s no real staff in this session, yet he claims to have found one. Isn’t he trying to approach Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yexu to avoid suspicion?”

Indeed, Wang Ruichang stood out among the three. Su Nantian and Wen Ran knew all staff were fake, so his claim was highly suspicious.

“His behavior is indeed questionable, but we can’t judge him outright. He might just be eager to take credit. Since he stood out, I’d trust him more. Ultimately, whether he has ulterior motives will be clear if he approaches Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yexu. With the surveillance, we don’t need to rush.”

Su Nantian smiled and immediately returned to his room with Wen Ran.

As soon as he arrived, Su Nantian opened his laptop, connected to the internet, and accessed the surveillance system.

The rooms of Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yexu were clearly visible on the screen.

“Wait and see if anyone comes tonight,” he said, placing the TV remote nearby before engaging in their own activities.

Once anyone approached Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yexu, the computer would immediately signal.

Although their main mission was to identify traitors within Dihao Group, Qi Yinzhen didn’t want the trip to be entirely consumed by work.

However, due to this restriction, he couldn’t go out with Wen Ran, so he arranged a luxurious candlelit dinner in the hotel. It was a small romance while waiting for results.

Wen Ran was delighted by the arrangement but felt it wasn’t a business trip—more like a vacation. Being with Su Nantian felt like a honeymoon.

Yet, an issue arose when the dinner was finished, and no one came to Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yexu’s rooms.

Su Nantian was puzzled, so he sent signals to both Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yexu to contact him and inquire about the situation.

Chapter 419: Exposure

Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yexu, seated in their respective rooms, received Su Nantian’s signal. They immediately opened their phones and connected via video call.

Su Nantian’s computer screen displayed both of them simultaneously, with all three parties connected.

Su Nantian asked immediately, “Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yexu, did no one come? I’m starting to think the surveillance might be faulty. No one has approached you all night. Did you definitely give them your contact details?”

This puzzled Su Nantian, as he had confidently expected someone to approach them tonight. Yet after finishing their candlelit dinner, no one had arrived.

Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yexu shook their heads simultaneously.

“Boss, no one came. We’ve been waiting in our rooms all night. The only person who knocked was the waiter delivering dinner,” Qi Yinzhen said, frowning.

Qi Yexu nodded in agreement: “Yes, boss, we’ve already conveyed our intentions subtly but clearly to the three of them. We gave them our contact details and room numbers. Yet no one came tonight. I’ve been waiting all night.”

Qi Yinzhen understood that the three hadn’t acted tonight, except for Wang Ruichang, who claimed to have found someone and planned to meet her for dinner.

“What about the person monitoring Wang Ruichang?” Su Nantian asked further, as he felt uneasy after Wang Ruichang’s statement and had dispatched a secret agent to watch him.

“The person is already monitoring him. He’s dining with a woman in the hotel restaurant. I don’t think she’s an official; it seems he’s just lustful. He’ll report any unusual activity.” Qi Yinzhen explained the situation to Su Nantian.

Su Nantian could only groan and press his forehead. After a while, he said, “I understand. You two continue. If no one comes tonight, we’ll proceed as planned.”

He then disconnected the video call. He hadn’t expected no one to act tonight.

“What’s going on? No one acted at all? Did you make a mistake?” Su Nantian asked Wen Ran, puzzled. If the three had ulterior motives, they wouldn’t have stayed inactive tonight.

“I believe they do have ill intentions. I just don’t know why they didn’t act tonight. Perhaps because this trip is with you and me, the highest-ranking officials in Dihao Group, they’re cautious and hesitant,” Wen Ran replied, frowning as he analyzed the situation carefully to avoid Su Nantian thinking he was wrong.

Su Nantian smiled at Wen Ran’s earnestness, then ruffled her hair and said, “Alright, I was just teasing you. It’s fine; we’ll watch tomorrow. Since it’s late, let’s rest.”

Seeing that Zhang Feng, Wang Ruichang, and Li Hounian hadn’t acted, Su Nantian suggested they rest. Wen Ran nodded, and the two fell asleep.

The first day’s actions had inexplicably failed to lure anyone, but Su Nantian wasn’t upset. There was still the second day.

While Su Nantian and Wen Ran were asleep, they suddenly heard a signal from their computer.

Su Nantian had light sleep due to habit, so he immediately heard the sound. He glanced at Wen Ran, who was deeply asleep, and didn’t wake her.

Su Nantian got out of bed and approached the computer. The time on the screen was five in the morning.

When Su Nantian saw the surveillance video, he smiled slightly.

In Qi Yinzhen’s room, a guest had arrived—none other than Li Hounian.

Here, you might not know that he and Qi Yinzhen were sitting in the room, each expression and word clearly conveyed to Su Nantian.

“I knew you’d come, but I didn’t expect you to choose this time. I thought you’d have approached me last night, but it seems you’re being cautious.” Qi Yinzhen smiled at Li Hounian.

Li Hounian nodded but remained cautious.

“You should know I’m here with the chairman and president of Dihao Group. Naturally, I must be careful. The night was crowded, and most people would guess something might happen at this time. I wouldn’t want to be caught in the crossfire.”

Li Hounian’s experience with bidding sessions and private transactions was evident. He had avoided the night, choosing to meet Qi Yinzhen at dawn instead.

“Being cautious is always good. Since you’ve come, let’s discuss business.” Qi Yinzhen smiled and pulled out the documents he had prepared.

“Here are my questions about Dihao Group’s bidding preparations. What information did you submit? This is the offer I’ve prepared for you. If you’re willing, you can join our company or take a lump sum to leave—both options are available.”

The two proposals Qi Yinzhen held were pre-prepared by Su Nantian. He wanted to see whether Li Hounian sought a position or money.

Su Nantian wasn’t surprised to see Li Hounian, as among the three, he had the most confidence to leave.

As the business director responsible for external partnerships, Li Hounian could easily take Dihao Group’s resources with him.

From the start, Su Nantian had suspected Li Hounian was most likely to flee. It turned out he hadn’t been wrong.

“ I won’t join your company, so I’ll choose the money. I’ll share all Dihao Group’s bidding information with you. However, I also want you to introduce me to some business in the island city.”

As Su Nantian was deep in thought, Li Hounian’s voice came through the computer.

Chapter 420: The Deal

Su Nantian hadn’t expected Li Hounian’s ambition to be so great—seeking both money and business opportunities.

It seemed Li Hounian truly intended to leave Dihao Group, starting his own venture. With his current position, it was the easiest path; he controlled most of Dihao Group’s business dealings. If he could also establish operations in the island city, even if he were shut out in Hangcheng, he could still survive.

As long as he survived, after some time, he could rise again. Li Hounian’s plans were clearly well-thought-out, not only considering his own job change but also preparing for all possible future obstacles.

Qi Yinzhen followed Su Nantian’s instructions precisely, and he would certainly agree without hesitation.

In the surveillance, Qi Yinzhen smiled and said, “Of course, but I’m sad to lose such a good partner. However, everything is about fate; I don’t need to force you. The money is ready for you. If you want business introduction in the island city, I can also provide it.”

Li Hounian hadn’t expected Qi Yinzhen to be so accommodating, agreeing to all his conditions. He was momentarily stunned but soon looked happy.

“That’s great. I’ll share all Dihao Group’s bidding information with you. But I need you to pay a deposit first. Not much—five million.”

Li Hounian’s demand was clearly excessive, and this was just a deposit.

“Mr. Li, your price is too high. This bidding session’s total amount is nearly a billion, but you’re asking for five million just for a deposit. Isn’t that too greedy?” Qi Yinzhen continued negotiating with Li Hounian.

Five million wasn’t a small sum, and if Qi Yinzhen agreed immediately to obtain evidence of the deal, it would raise Li Hounian’s suspicions.

Moreover, Li Hounian currently controlled nearly 60% of Dihao Group’s business information. If he sensed something and decided to fight back, it would be a major problem for Dihao Group, Su Nantian, and Wen Ran.

Even though this company had been easily acquired, since it was now under Su Nantian’s control, he couldn’t allow such an event.

Li Hounian paused, then nodded: “Alright, I’ll compromise. Five million is a lot at once. Let’s make it three million as a deposit, and another three million later. That should be acceptable?”

He then took out a USB drive from his pocket and waved it in front of Qi Yinzhen.

“Look at this—this USB drive contains all the bidding information for Dihao Group. You can have it now if you agree.” Li Hounian smiled, his face revealing a cunning expression typical of an older man.

“Hahahaha. You’re quite amusing, Mr. Li. Three million is still too much. Let’s say two million; I’ll transfer it to you now, and the remaining three million later. That’s a total of two million. What do you think?” Qi Yinzhen continued negotiating, presenting his conditions.

“Hmm…” Li Hounian hesitated slightly.

“I’ll also introduce five business magnates from the island city to you. We can all have dinner together, but after that, you’ll need to handle it yourself.” Qi Yinzhen offered his bait. This condition was crucial for Li Hounian.

Finally, after hearing this, Li Hounian felt tempted and slapped his thigh, saying, “Alright, then let’s do it. Transfer the two million to me now, and I’ll give you the USB drive.”

Qi Yinzhen nodded and immediately asked Li Hounian for his personal account details. Within minutes, he transferred two million via online banking.

“I’ve received it. Here’s the USB drive. All the bidding information is inside. However, even if you obtain this, it doesn’t guarantee your success in the bidding session. I won’t be responsible for what happens afterward.”

Li Hounian was clearly a shrewd businessman, never leaving himself any dead ends. He wouldn’t make absolute promises.

Qi Yinzhen smiled and stood up, saying, “I know that. The bidding session is about each side’s strength. However, I need your bid and advantage information to strike precisely. After all, the only competitor in this bidding session is Dihao Group.”

“Hahahaha. I wish you success in the bidding session,” Li Hounian said, satisfied as he stood up and left Qi Yinzhen’s room.

After Li Hounian truly left, Qi Yinzhen looked at the surveillance camera. Though he couldn’t communicate with Su Nantian face-to-face through it, he knew Su Nantian was watching.

“Boss, I’ve completed my task. What’s next?” Qi Yinzhen said to the camera.

Soon, Qi Yinzhen received a video call invitation from Su Nantian and they communicated via phone.

“I didn’t expect the fish to bite so quickly, but he was also cautious. I waited all night yesterday, but he didn’t come. He chose this time instead,” Su Nantian said angrily.

“You can tell he’s a veteran; he probably did this even when Leng Boxiong was in Dihao Group,” Qi Yinzhen replied.

“The next step is simple. Since he sold the bidding information and has your transfer records, we can immediately have someone take him down. We must destroy him completely; otherwise, with his control over Dihao Group’s business information, I’ll have trouble later.”

Su Nantian had also considered Dihao Group’s future. If he merely caught this incident and fired Li Hounian, the latter would surely use underhanded methods when leaving.

People like Li Hounian, who controlled Dihao Group’s business information, could cause major problems if it was leaked.

Chapter 421: The Conclusion

“I understand, but how should we proceed? Do we really need to involve the inspection team?” Qi Yinzhen asked about the next steps, as this matter involved many aspects. If they wanted to quickly and easily remove Li Hounian, the only way was to involve the inspection team.

Su Nantian immediately shook his head: “Involving the inspection team is impossible; it would only draw us in. Just give him a warning. My main goal is to retrieve Dihao Group’s business information from his hands, which will also help clean up internal forces and establish authority for Wen Ran.”

After a moment of contemplation, Su Nantian continued: “Call Qi Yexu and the others over to your room. I’ll explain the next steps shortly.”

After saying this, Su Nantian hung up immediately because he heard movement in the room—apparently Wen Ran had woken up.

“Why did you get up so early? Who were you talking to?” Indeed, as Su Nantian turned around, he saw Wen Ran’s eyes emerging from the inner room, still groggy.

“Someone has bitten the hook. He came early in the morning to meet Qi Yinzhen, and they conducted a deal. Today is our day to wrap it up,” Su Nantian immediately explained the situation.

“Who was it? I missed it and wanted to see how they conducted the deal,” Wen Ran said, sounding slightly regretful.

“I was right—it was Li Hounian. This man holds Dihao Group’s business information and has been acting recklessly,” Su Nantian said, though his tone carried a hint of satisfaction. He was showing Wen Ran that his initial suspicions were correct.

“Indeed, it was Li Hounian. What are you planning to do next?” Wen Ran asked immediately, as he felt this matter was quite tricky. Since Li Hounian was Dihao Group’s business director, he had access to some confidential information. If they clashed openly, it might threaten the company’s survival.

“We must set this trap. I’ll go find Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yexu to discuss it shortly,” Su Nantian said with a sly smile.

Soon, the bidding session was held as scheduled. Today would be the day the project’s winner was decided.

Except for Li Hounian, Wang Ruichang, and Zhang Feng, everyone knew this bidding session was fake.

The host of the bidding session stepped onto the stage and took the microphone, addressing the audience: “Thank you all for coming to our session. We’ve reviewed all the documents submitted by your companies.”

“Each company’s conditions and your perceived advantages have been thoroughly examined. Today is the final stage of this bidding session. All representatives can present your proposals, and we’ll choose a partner to collaborate with. Within the next three months, we will conduct a comprehensive evaluation of your company and ultimately decide whether we can cooperate.”

The host was also an agent from the secret organization. His eloquence made him ideal for this role of pretending to host.

He spoke above, and Su Nantian listened below, nodding in satisfaction at his performance.
