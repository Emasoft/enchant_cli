“Regarding that man named Liu An, he claims to be one of the top three masters in Jiangcheng’s Daoist circles. He offered fifty million to buy his own life. I just confirmed with Lu Shan, and it’s true,” the bloodied subordinate said respectfully, showing no intention to interfere.

The tiger-eyed man’s gaze was filled with shock. He hadn’t expected Su Nantian to have eliminated such a formidable opponent. Indeed, he had chosen the right path; his ascent would be unimpeded.

Yet Su Nantian remained unmoved. The land of China was vast and teeming with talent, concealing countless hidden masters. Liu An’s claim to be among the top three in Jiangcheng was nothing but self-aggrandizement.

Still, Liu An’s information held some value. At least, it confirmed that Su Nantian’s strength was unmatched in the open, giving him a sense of security.

“Big Brother Tian, what should we do with him?” the tiger-eyed man asked cautiously.

“Never let a tiger return to the mountains. Eliminate him directly.”

Su Nantian snapped out of his thoughts, offering a calm solution. If Liu An’s words were true, his connections must be formidable. There was always the risk of someone else seeking revenge for him. Su Nantian wasn’t alone now and didn’t want unnecessary trouble.

Upon hearing this, the tiger-eyed man sighed in relief. He had feared Su Nantian would be too enamored by the five million figure to act. After all, money was valuable but not easily obtained. Liu An’s wealth was a hot potato—no one knew when trouble would come knocking.

Chapter 347: Wu You’er

“I’ll fabricate evidence that Liu An and his men left Jiangcheng, clearing the situation,” the tiger-eyed man told Su Nantian before signaling his subordinate to dispose of Liu An.

Su Nantian nodded, then turned his gaze toward the subordinate interrogating Lu Shan.

The subordinate quickly replied: “Lu Shan’s visible assets are under your control, Master Hu. His private properties include three mansions, two lovers, and four illegitimate children…”

“Enough of that! Focus on the essentials!” The tiger-eyed man observed Su Nantian’s slight displeasure and reprimanded the subordinate.

“Ah, Lu Shan’s cash is stored in overseas accounts—approximately fifty million. Stocks and futures add another few million,” the subordinate stammered, whispering his report.

“Such money is quite hot,” Su Nantian frowned, clearly hesitant.

The tiger-eyed man understood his meaning and replied softly: “For someone like Lu Shan, disappearing is no problem if the new owner knows what they’re doing. There’s no issue with moving the funds. I’ll transfer them to your account later.”

Su Nantian nodded in satisfaction, smiling at the tiger-eyed man: “Good. You handle it here; I’ll return now.”

“Rest assured, Big Brother Tian,” the tiger-eyed man vowed, watching Su Nantian’s figure recede into the distance.

Not long after, Su Nantian’s account received thirty million. A message from the tiger-eyed man explained that transferring such a large sum domestically would take time, with the remainder to follow.

Su Nantian trusted his subordinates and didn’t fear being deceived. Besides, there was no immediate need for the money, so he dismissed it from his mind.

Checking the time, he estimated that Yue Xiaoshan’s banquet was about to end. He prepared to drive back for them, also calling Lin Suyun and the others on his way.

Though it had been a while since they last met, the women understood he was occupied with important matters and were considerate enough not to urge him back to Fengcheng. Some even teased about Wu Lianxing being pursued by another young nobleman.

“Ha! Lianxing is beautiful and skilled in music, chess, poetry, and calligraphy. Naturally, someone would chase her. Otherwise, my judgment must be poor.”

Su Nantian wasn’t angry but rather pleased. He was about to boast when his eyes caught a glimpse of someone ahead, nearly making him drop his phone. He had seen Wu Lianxing standing there!

“Wait, that’s not Lianxing.”

His quick reflexes allowed him to realize it wasn’t her. He scanned with his spiritual awareness and discovered the girl resembled Wu Lianxing but had clear differences. She was two years younger, and while their appearances were similar at first glance, those who knew Wu Lianxing would easily distinguish them. Wu Lianxing’s demeanor was classical, cultivated through years of studying music and literature. This girl was more lively and energetic, lacking Wu Lianxing’s refined composure.

Hearing Su Nantian mutter to himself, Gao Jingjing interjected with a laugh: “Hey, are you so smitten by Lianxing that you’re losing your mind? She’s with us right now. Can you see her?”

“Hmph, I’ll show you a miracle,” Su Nantian said before hanging up. He quickly snapped a few photos of the girl from his car. His phone was a Dragon Group special model with high resolution, capturing every detail under the streetlights.

He sent the photos over. Within ten seconds, his phone rang again. He answered and heard Wu Lianxing’s voice in disbelief: “Nantian, she’s my cousin Wu You’er. Her family should be living elsewhere, right? How could she be in Jiangcheng at this hour? And alone? Did something happen?”

“I’m not sure,” Su Nantian admitted. If he hadn’t glanced at the girl by chance, he wouldn’t have noticed her resemblance to Wu Lianxing. He would’ve remained unaware of the situation.

But since Wu You’er was Wu Lianxing’s cousin, he had to care. He quickly agreed: “Lianxing, don’t worry. I’ll check it out now. If she’s in trouble, I’ll help.”

Wu Lianxing insisted: “Yes, be gentle. Don’t hurt her.”

“Got it,” Su Nantian replied before hanging up. He pondered for a few seconds, recalling what Wu Lianxing had told him about the Wu family. The Wu clan’s ancestral home was in the capital, a massive thousand-year-old lineage with many descendants across China. Wu Lianxing’s family lived in Fengcheng, while others resided elsewhere naturally.

Wu Lianxing had mentioned Wu You’er shouldn’t be in Jiangcheng, so she was puzzled about her presence. Su Nantian had no choice but to investigate.

“Ugh, I’m just a hardworking soul with never-ending tasks,” he sighed. Despite his frustration, he had agreed to Wu Lianxing’s request and had to ensure Wu You’er was safe before leaving.

With that in mind, he slowly parked by the roadside and walked over to Wu You’er, who was deep in thought. “Um… I’m…”

Before he could finish, Wu You’er sensed someone approaching and immediately threw a punch at his jaw. It was fast and fierce, leaving no room for mercy.

“Wow, quick reflexes,” Su Nantian blocked the punch and quickly introduced himself: “Don’t be reckless. I’m a friend of Wu Lianxing!”

“You say you are,” Wu You’er clearly doubted him. She was about to attack again when she suddenly gasped and cursed: “Sigh, bastard!”

“Sorry, are you injured?” Su Nantian only now noticed Wu You’er’s wounds. He hadn’t used much strength, yet she couldn’t withstand it, even aggravating her injury.

Wu You’er remained cold and pulled her wrist from Su Nantian’s grasp: “Who are you? None of your business.”

Su Nantian had no choice but to reason: “But you’re seriously injured. If not treated, it could be life-threatening.”

“That’s my problem. It has nothing to do with you,” Wu You’er refused his help, glaring at Su Nantian: “Leave me alone. Move aside.”

“I…” Su Nantian was speechless, but he couldn’t just walk away. He tried to persuade her: “Then at least tell me what you plan to do. Maybe I can help you find time to treat your wounds.”

Chapter 348: Taking Responsibility

“Go away. Don’t interfere,” she said, about to tell him to leave when her brows furrowed involuntarily. She instinctively pressed a hand against her abdomen, and blood seeped through her fingers.

“Your wounds have split open?” Su Nantian, having dealt with countless injuries, immediately recognized the situation. He urged: “Hey, I really am your cousin’s friend. Now that it’s come to this, why are you still hesitating? You don’t value your life?”

He then mentioned a few things about Wu Lianxing, details only she and those close to her would know. After hearing this, Wu You’er temporarily believed his identity and eased her guard. She must have known that with Wu Lianxing’s status, anyone could be her friend.

“Okay,” she said. Realizing her current state made it impossible to complete her plans alone, and since Su Nantian wouldn’t leave, she decided to include him. After a brief hesitation, she said: “I need you to watch someone—Zhang Bao from Hangcheng’s Zhang family. He’ll pass here shortly to meet with someone.”

Hangcheng was a major city adjacent to Jiangcheng, located to the southeast. Driving between them made this road essential.

“Zhang Bao? How did you get involved with such a person?” From Wu You’er’s attire, Su Nantian could tell her current financial status was merely middle-class. Meanwhile, the Zhang family in Hangcheng was as powerful as the Yue family in Jiangcheng. He found it hard to imagine Wu You’er having any connection with Zhang Bao.

Moreover, from Yue Xiaoshan’s findings, Su Nantian knew the group that had狙击ed the new Yue Group stock was involved with the Zhang family. As expected, he wanted to settle accounts with them and now Zhang Bao had walked into the trap.

If Zhang Bao truly offended Wu You’er, Su Nantian wouldn’t mind breaking one of his legs to teach him a lesson.

Seeing Su Nantian’s contemplative expression, Wu You’er impatiently urged: “Hey, do you agree or not? If you don’t, please move aside and stop blocking my way!”

“Hmph, you’re too eager,” Su Nantian snapped out of his thoughts and chuckled: “You want me to watch him? Fine. But before that, you should explain your situation with Zhang Bao. I need to know the details so I don’t rush in blindly.”

“Here’s how it is,” Wu You’er spoke quickly, explaining her feud with Zhang Bao in a few sentences. Su Nantian finally understood the situation.

Wu You’er’s father was Wu Tao, who was indeed Wu Lianxing’s uncle and relatively close. A few years ago, Wu Tao had left his job due to a leg injury and returned to Hangcheng for recovery. He also took care of his wife and daughter.

At that time, Wu You’er was still in school. The family had some savings and didn’t worry about money, living comfortably.

Unfortunately, this peaceful life was shattered months ago when the Zhang family clashed with local residents over developing a scenic area outside Hangcheng. Wu You’er’s mother’s hometown was right there.

The family had a few old houses as memories from her grandparents, and they naturally refused to let them be demolished. They argued with the Zhang family’s people, only for Zhang Bao’s men to scheme against them and stage a car accident.

To pay for Wu Tao’s treatment, the family borrowed ten thousand in high-interest loans. Unbeknownst to them, this financial company was controlled by Zhang Bao. All of it was part of his scheme to hinder Wu’s repayment, dragging on for half a year. The interest compounded several times, and Zhang Bao had his men, Yang Yuan, constantly harass them.

Wu You’er was desperate and sent her parents to relatives in another city for care, asking them to look after them. She herself followed Zhang Bao, hoping to retaliate secretly.

Unfortunately, she was discovered twice by Zhang’s bodyguards. They fought, and both sides had their victories. Wu You’er sustained many injuries, which was why Su Nantian had smelled blood earlier.

“Zhang Bao and the Zhang family are truly overstepping!” After Wu You’er’s account, Su Nantian was furious. Zhang Bao was an idiot for thinking he could get away with it.

Wu You’er noticed his anger and asked cautiously: “Hey, aren’t you just a friend of my cousin? Why are you so angry?”

At this point, Wu You’er only knew Su Nantian was her cousin’s friend. She didn’t know the depth of their relationship and couldn’t say everything outright.

Su Nantian was naturally protective. With Wu You’er’s family in trouble and Wu Lianxing’s instructions, he couldn’t stand by. Plus, he had already planned to target the Zhang family and now had another reason.

“Your problem is my problem. There’s no difference,” Su Nantian said confidently, quickly arranging: “You’re in a bad state now and injured. Why not go back to recover? I’ll handle Zhang Bao and ensure you’re satisfied, okay?”

“Not okay,” Wu You’er shook her head quickly: “That’s my enemy. I must take care of it myself…”

Before she could finish, Su Nantian interrupted firmly: “But can you even fight now?”

“I…” Wu You’er pouted, unsure how to respond. After all, Su Nantian was right—she couldn’t beat Zhang Bao’s bodyguards.

“Fine, do it my way,” Su Nantian persuaded: “Also, your father is recovering elsewhere. Don’t you want to take care of him yourself?”

“Okay,” Su Nantian’s words touched Wu You’er’s heart. After a brief hesitation, she nodded in agreement.

Su Nantian then took Wu You’er to the airport and bought her a ticket on the next flight. Before parting, they exchanged contact details. Su Nantian asked her to call immediately after arriving home for a check-in, promising to handle Zhang Bao once he finished his tasks in Jiangcheng.

As Wu You’er left, Su Nantian prepared to return. Suddenly, he received a call from Du Changwei.

Old Du first praised Su Nantian’s recent work, commending him for protecting the Yue family. Then he changed tone and instructed Su Nantian to stay away from Yue Xiaoshan, remaining hidden for a while. After all, before coming to Jiangcheng, Du had ordered Su Nantian to secretly protect them. But after arriving in Jiangcheng, the situation escalated, making Su Nantian well-known across the city. This made his secret mission impossible and required immediate termination.

Thus, the Dragon Group’s leadership decided to send two more capable members to replace Su Nantian as a bodyguard. Of course,褚彦 (Chu Yan) would still need to monitor the high-tech aspects.

After hearing Du’s instructions, Su Nantian considered it briefly before agreeing. He had planned to visit Hangcheng anyway to resolve Wu You’er’s issues, and Du sending replacements was perfectly timed. At least he wouldn’t worry about Yue Xiaoshan’s safety.

Additionally, Su Nantian had secretly deployed people. Ban Lanhu and his subordinates would also play a role in critical moments, saving him time and effort.

After talking with Du, Su Nantian arrived at the Ziju Hotel. He stepped in and found Yue Xiaoshan, hiding in a corner to recount the events.

Hearing Su Nantian was leaving, Yue Xiaoshan was naturally sad. But Su Nantian comforted her it was only temporary, to resolve some matters in Hangcheng. And Wu You’er’s situation was truly pitiable and needed immediate resolution. Yue Xiaoshan understood the urgency and only reminded him to be careful, not to get hurt.

The next afternoon, Du’s replacements arrived in Jiangcheng. Su Nantian personally met them and was surprised to find they were familiar faces—Zhang An and Tang Sanfeng. Old Tang had returned from Sichuan’s Tang Clan to fetch supplies, and now they were both ready to take over Su Nantian’s duties.

That evening, Su Nantian hosted a dinner at the Yue family villa to welcome them. He explained everything clearly, emphasizing details so they wouldn’t make mistakes.

At dawn the next day, Su Nantian set off alone for Hangcheng. Besides Wu You’er, he knew no one there and had to start from scratch.

After an hour on the plane, Su Nantian arrived at Hangcheng Airport. His first task was to find a means of transport. The simplest option was buying a car, as he wasn’t short on money.

But after thinking it over, he decided against it. He wouldn’t stay long in Hangcheng, and buying a car would involve paperwork and license plates—too troublesome. Renting one was more convenient.

He wandered around the airport for a while and found an ad for “Fufa Financial Company” on a streetlight. It offered car rentals, perfect for him.

He called them and explained his conditions. Within twenty minutes, a sixty-million-yuan Mercedes was delivered to him.

They signed the contract on the spot. Su Nantian paid the rent and took possession of the car. Next, he needed to find Zhang Bao and decide how to proceed.

Su Nantian drove around Hangcheng all afternoon. When it was time for dinner, he sent a text to Chu Yan: “Zhang Bao. Location.”

Though he couldn’t meet Chu Yan directly, this small task was manageable for him.

Soon after, Chu Yan replied: “Jinlan Club, Room 288.”

Su Nantian confirmed the location on his phone and quickly finished dinner before driving there. These bastards were really bold, thinking no one could stop them.

A moment later, at eight p.m., the city was still brightly lit. Su Nantian sat in his car, finished a cigarette, got out, crushed the butt, and looked at the sign of Jinlan Club before walking into the lobby. He ignored the staff’s questions and headed straight for Room 288 on the second floor.

Inside the room, Zhang Bao and his men were surrounded by women, drinking and touching them. Yang Yuan was there too.

“Big Brother, I’ll definitely handle that bastard. I’ll make sure to send that girl to your bed,” Zhang Bao said, turning his head and eyeing Yang Yuan for a while. He asked: “You didn’t say they were willing? Tell me the truth—what happened? I don’t want to be beaten without knowing why.”

“Big Brother…” Yang Yuan’s eyes flickered. “I didn’t know they would back out at the last minute. Those guys are just scum who took my money but didn’t do their job. I’ll deal with them next time.”

“Useless,” Zhang Bao slapped Yang Yuan’s head. “Who are you trying to act tough with?”

Yang Yuan quickly laughed and signaled the two women beside Zhang Bao to calm him down. But just then, the door was suddenly pushed open.

A very out-of-place figure walked in. He had overheard their conversation outside and, combined with Wu You’er’s description, already knew the situation.

The music in the room suddenly got louder. No one noticed Su Nantian walking up behind Yang Yuan.

There were many bodyguards on the sofa, all fierce and intimidating—these were clearly Zhang Bao’s real guards.

Yang Yuan saw Zhang Bao’s anger had eased and boasted: “Big Brother, I’ll make those people beg for mercy. Whatever you want to do with them is your decision.”

Before Zhang Bao could respond, Su Nantian patted Yang Yuan’s shoulder.

“Who the hell…” Yang Yuan shook his shoulder to get Su Nantian off, about to scold him. But when he turned around and saw Su Nantian’s face, he froze!

He had been lost in thoughts about defeating the Wu family. Now, seeing this stranger suddenly appear, Yang Yuan’s face turned pale. His eyes showed fear: “Who are you?”

After saying that, Yang Yuan swallowed nervously and wished he could dig a hole to hide in. His earlier bravado was forgotten.

Su Nantian said nothing and sat down, pouring himself a drink.

The music in the air was still playing but felt strangely uncomfortable. It seemed like silence had fallen, even making Zhang Bao’s face turn iron-gray.

No one knew how Su Nantian had found them, but he was already there.

“Since we’re all here, let’s settle the score,” Su Nantian took a sip of wine and broke the awkward silence. He repeated Wu You’er’s story to let these people die knowing.

Chapter 349: The Hangcheng Wu Family

After hearing this, Yang Yuan snapped out of his trance. Realizing the room was full of Zhang Bao’s bodyguards, some even former soldiers, he immediately felt emboldened.

He glared at Su Nantian and slammed the table: “Alright, let’s settle this. Half a year ago, Wu Tao was in an accident and couldn’t pay the medical bills. I lent them ten thousand. Now half a year has passed, and it’s fifty million including interest.”

“Then what do you want?” Su Nantian smiled slyly and raised an eyebrow.

“What do I want? Pay it back, and this will be over. If you can’t…” Yang Yuan laughed coldly: “Then that girl would have to pay with her body.”

“Oh?” Su Nantian shook his wine glass, smiling innocently. But in an instant, he glared with a sinister look and smashed the glass against Yang Yuan’s pig-like head.

“Ah!”

Yang Yuan’s face was covered in blood. His features, usually hard to distinguish, twisted painfully. Blood gushed from his head.

Su Nantian didn’t stop there; he used the broken glass to stab Yang Yuan’s head repeatedly. The sharp shards made this fat man scream like a pig.

Then he threw the glass on the ground and shook his hands, showing no damage at all—like nothing had happened.

The subordinates around the room saw their comrade being insulted and were about to attack. Zhang Bao noticed the situation was bad and raised his hand, signaling them to stay calm. Then he turned to Su Nantian: “Brother, since you’ve come to defend the Wu family, let’s settle this openly.”

Su Nantian said nothing but stared at Zhang Bao expressionlessly. To avoid awkwardness, Zhang Bao spoke again: “So, are you going to pay or not?”

“First, talk about Wu You’er’s situation,” Su Nantian smiled, making it hard to tell if he was angry or happy. But there was always an eerie pressure.

Zhang Bao stayed silent. This was indeed his fault, but if it weren’t for Yang Yuan’s trickery, he wouldn’t have made such a mistake. He even regretted it.

The few top bodyguards beside him were angry at Su Nantian but couldn’t act without Zhang Bao’s orders.

“I can give you the money, but how do we count the threats and injuries? Should I beat them back for you?” Su Nantian said, then slammed his hand on the coffee table. When he slowly let go, a crack appeared in the middle of it.

Was this a coincidence or…?

No one else noticed, but Zhang Bao did. His shock was indescribable.

Who was this man? He had never met such a master before. Zhang Bao immediately abandoned his thoughts of confrontation, realizing it was foolish to provoke Su Nantian. He had chosen the wrong place to die.

Su Nantian stood up, grabbed the wine bottle and smashed it on Yang Yuan’s head. This man was already in pain and convulsing, screaming and falling onto the sofa.

He coldly glanced at Zhang Bao and said: “Three days. If you don’t give me an answer, Hangcheng will no longer have Zhang Bao.”

The words were direct but carried a clear threat.

Zhang Bao shivered, his pupils constricted. He felt as if he had fallen into an icy hole, completely cold.

Su Nantian walked out of the room. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to kill, but survival in this society required more than just fighting—it needed a brain.

Zhang Bao clearly didn’t know about Yang Yuan’s actions and had only acted out of lust. But it wasn’t enough to cost his life.

As for Yang Yuan…

Su Nantian’s eyes were filled with endless killing intent. If Zhang Bao continued to protect him, he wouldn’t mind both of them disappearing.

Inside the room, the atmosphere was strange. No one spoke for a moment. After half a minute, someone stood up and said: “Big Brother Bao, we have so many people. Why are we afraid of this little bastard? If it weren’t for you stopping us, I’d have killed this dog…”

The voice was loud and arrogant. But Zhang Bao didn’t react at all, his face even darker.

He coldly glanced at everyone and pointed to the coffee table. “Boom!” It split into two halves instantly.

In an instant, all bodyguards fell silent. The room became quiet immediately.

Zhang Bao said softly: “This man is strong, but I’ve been around for years. I know some powerful people. Some things just shouldn’t be made public…”

He looked at Yang Yuan, who was unconscious, and his expression turned ruthless.

Those who reached the top position weren’t just lucky. They had to know when to fight and when not to. Some people could be provoked, but others couldn’t.

Meanwhile, Su Nantian left the club and called Wu You’er to confirm their location. He drove straight there, arriving at the Wu family’s home thirty minutes later.

The Wu family lived in a three-story house on the east side of the city. It was an old building, matching the surrounding alleys.

Seeing him arrive so quickly, Wu You’er was very happy and introduced him to her parents. Wu Tao was delighted when he learned Su Nantian was Wu Lianxing’s boyfriend and immediately arranged for him to stay at his house. He told everyone Su Nantian was a distant cousin, so the neighbors knew about the young and handsome relative.

Thus, Su Nantian stayed comfortably at the Wu family for two days. On the third day, it was Mid-Autumn Festival. The Wu family planned to visit their maternal uncle’s house for the holiday and invited Su Nantian to join.

After about an hour, Su Nantian drove the Mercedes with three people into Hangcheng’s famous Ban Mountain Villa area. Residents here were either rich or powerful.

How could Wu You’er have such a powerful maternal uncle?

Su Nantian looked around the environment and then smiled coldly in his mind. From how the Wu family had suffered, he could guess their relationship with the maternal uncle’s family was poor. One must be strong to be respected; without money, power, or status, others wouldn’t look at you.

“Big Brother Tian, when will our family be able to live in a place like this?” Wu You’er asked.

Hearing her question, Su Nantian smiled but felt a pang of bitterness. At such a young age, she had to carry so much weight—this was truly hard on her.

Su Nantian smiled and teased: “Don’t worry. In a few days, I’ll buy you a big villa.”

As they arrived at the maternal uncle’s house, the car had just entered the courtyard when many relatives were already there. The yard was full of small cars.

The maternal uncle’s villa consisted of connected houses, forming a circle. A large yard had many young people sitting around.

Hangcheng was in the south, so it never got too cold. The sun was bright overhead now.

When the Mercedes parked in the yard, it immediately attracted many eyes.

“Hey, whose Mercedes is that?”

As Su Nantian and the three exited the car, everyone stared in disbelief.

After a while, their emotions slightly calmed down. Someone mocked:

“Who’s family has a Mercedes now?”
“Did she catch a rich husband?”
“No, no. I think this young man is Wu Tao’s cousin. Oh, it's a very distant relative. They’re just taking advantage of his kindness. Otherwise, how could they have a Mercedes?”
The people’s mocking comments made Su Nantian’s face dark. He had never imagined the Wu family was treated so poorly in their extended family, without any say or respect?

Wu Tao and his wife pretended not to hear the comments and walked into the villa. They asked Su Nantian and Wu You’er to chat with these relatives, building relationships and even specifically told Su Nantian not to cause trouble. They were all family.

“Hmph, this is also a family?” Su Nantian thought coldly. As long as they didn’t provoke him, who would be so foolish to seek trouble?

As soon as the parents left, Wu You’er raised her head and pointed at the Mercedes: “Stop talking nonsense. This is my Big Brother Tian’s car, not a rich husband.”

She didn’t see the disdainful looks of these people. They looked down on her, and that was it.

“Mr. Su, where do you work now?” The man emphasized the word “work,” looking indifferent and trying to see Su Nantian’s embarrassment.

Wu You’er was clearly upset and wanted to argue, but Su Nantian stopped her. What use was there in arguing with them? They wouldn’t earn money.

But Wu You’er couldn’t help it and turned around: “This car was bought by my brother. You people are just jealous. Don’t say grapes are sour because you can’t get them. You don’t have the ability, but you don’t let others buy? That’s really shameless.”

Before she finished speaking, someone suddenly said: “Hey, I think I’ve seen this car before.”

Another person circled the car and said: “I guess I have. It seems….”

Wu You’er interrupted him and said proudly: “You’ve seen it, right? Probably just touched it at the 4S shop.”

The man didn’t respond to Wu You’er but closed his eyes, looking deep in thought.

After a few seconds, the man suddenly relaxed and exclaimed: “I remember now. This isn’t the car from that company called Fufa Financial, right?”

“Ah, I think it is,” a thin-faced young man replied.

“Heh, you don’t know, this company’s name is just for lending high-interest loans. It also provides money, cars, and even houses to let some people show off.”

“Su Nantian, am I right?” The well-dressed man approached Su Nantian with a mocking expression.

Su Nantian said nothing. He hadn’t expected someone to recognize it so quickly.

If people knew, he would be embarrassed again.

“Can’t even afford to rent a car. Your lie was exposed. What’s the point of showing off?”
“You people are really shameless, coming every year without being invited.”
“Some people have been poor their whole lives and are afraid of it.”

Everyone spoke at once. Su Nantian ignored them, but Wu You’er was upset and pouted: “You’re wrong. This car is really bought by my Big Brother Tian.”

She believed in Su Nantian and would never believe these people’s words.

But the嫌弃 looks and mocking words from everyone made her feel uncomfortable. Her eyes were full of tears.

The well-dressed man wanted to completely humiliate Su Nantian and his family. He took out his phone, found the introduction page of Fufa Financial Company, and there was indeed a photo of this car with the same license plate. It wasn’t fake.

He then took it to Su Nantian and Wu You’er, letting them see clearly. Then he showed it to the people present.

“Fake! You’re lying. This car is really bought by my Big Brother Tian…” Wu You’er’s voice grew weaker, ending with a slight sob.

Su Nantian raised his eyebrows and flashed two lights of coldness in his eyes.

“Unexpectedly, it’s really rented. Ha…” Someone who didn’t care about trouble laughed loudly.

Before the words ended, they heard the sound of a car engine. Looking at the entrance, another Mercedes had driven in and attracted everyone’s attention.

Wu You’er’s eyes were full of tears, and she hugged Su Nantian’s hand excitedly: “Big Brother Tian, tell them this car is yours. It’s not that stupid financial company’s. Please say it quickly.”

Su Nantian sighed: “The pure are clear.”

Today was really a mess. People around him demanded Su Nantian to show proof of purchase. If the name on it wasn’t his, they would definitely have no chance.

Everyone laughed. Just as the other Mercedes had parked and a man and woman got out, the woman was Wu You’er’s cousin Shi Tiantian. She held a man’s hand and walked over to introduce him.

Shi Tiantian smiled and introduced the man as her boyfriend. She specifically said this Mercedes was his and asked everyone how it looked, if he was handsome.

“Ah, truth can’t be hidden. Falsehoods can’t last. Unlike some people who can’t afford it but still rent, they really are shameless.”

“Poor family, always pretending to be high and mighty. Now it’s fun.”

“Everyone is the same. Dogs can’t change their nature.”

Su Nantian lifted his head, still smiling but with eyes narrowed into slits. The light flickered, making people feel scared.

Wu You’er had red eyes and pouted.
