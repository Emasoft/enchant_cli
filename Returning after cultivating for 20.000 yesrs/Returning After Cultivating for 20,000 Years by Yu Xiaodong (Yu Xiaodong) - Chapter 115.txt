After Su Nantian finished speaking, Liang Bo immediately nodded frantically, indicating he would definitely comply.

Su Nantian then slowly removed his hand from Liang Bo’s mouth. Indeed, as Su Nantian had anticipated, Liang Bo did not shout or protest but instead took a few deep breaths of fresh air before speaking in a weak voice: “Who are you exactly?”

Even as Liang Bo spoke, he did not dare to turn around. Su Nantian stood behind him, and Liang Bo, shrewd as ever, knew that if this man harbored ill intent, he would be killed the moment he saw his face. Thus, he remained cautious and did not turn his head.

Yet Liang Bo had overestimated the situation, but this very hesitation granted Su Nantian a significant advantage. If Liang Bo had seen Su Nantian’s face, he would have immediately recognized him as a member of the Nan Gong clan. However, since Liang Bo dared not turn around, his awe and fear toward Su Nantian might make him more receptive to the questions that followed.

Su Nantian cleared his throat and said, “I came here to seek some information. I know you are a gossipmonger in the inland port, and there is no matter that remains unknown to you. I also know you deal in information, so if you provide me with satisfactory details, I will pay you accordingly.”

Upon hearing this, Liang Bo’s fear lessened slightly. If the man had come to inquire about him, it suggested no immediate threat to his life. Moreover, the promise of payment meant he was at least safe for now.

Chapter 570: The Deal

Liang Bo, upon realizing the man had come to purchase his information, felt somewhat relieved. At least this ensured his safety.

Yet Liang Bo remained cautious. As a professional gossipmonger, he relied on his sharp mind and eloquence. Thus, he did not immediately turn around.

Liang Bo smiled and said, “Forgive my ignorance—what exactly are you seeking from me? If I have the information, I will do my best to assist.”

Su Nantian nodded in response. “I want to know if Li Zhe and Wang Bo have any conflicts or grudges. Though they appear amicable on the surface, I suspect there are hidden tensions between them.”

Upon hearing this, Liang Bo immediately understood. He continued smiling and said, “I suppose you are the one from the Nan Gong clan? Few people would ask about these two without reason. Also, you avoided my boss Zhang Yuan, which suggests you know I am under his command and thus cannot purchase his information.”

Su Nantian was somewhat surprised. He had not expected Liang Bo to be so perceptive; the man had grasped his intent immediately.

At that moment, Liang Bo turned to face Su Nantian directly. Upon recognizing him as one of the two men who had arrived earlier, he confirmed his suspicions.

Su Nantian, realizing his thoughts had been exposed, did not hide it but instead smiled. “From the start, I never intended to conceal my purpose. If I am purchasing your information, it is only natural that you deduce my intent. Moreover, this information will not harm you or Zhang Yuan. Do you truly believe your alliance with him can yield any benefit? The day will come when this union collapses. I simply wish to find the fastest way.”

Liang Bo was a shrewd man. He understood that such an unconditional alliance could not last long. The three factions had inherent conflicts, and their current unity stemmed from external pressures. Yet they still harbored mutual disdain and could not reconcile over this matter. Furthermore, each held their own power within the inland port, making unity impossible.

“Then what do you wish to know?” Liang Bo said coolly.

Su Nantian recognized this as an implicit agreement and replied, “You must know something about the conflicts between Li Zhe and Wang Bo. Perhaps some hidden secrets that connect them both.”

“I know these matters are confidential,” Liang Bo replied.

Su Nantian suddenly recalled the worker he had met at the dock that day. People like them, at the bottom of the hierarchy, often did not understand why their superiors clashed. They simply took sides instinctively. Thus, such fundamental conflicts could not be easily exposed. Liang Bo’s caution was justified; revealing the core conflict between Wang Bo and Li Zhe would effectively expose Zhang Yuan as well.

“I understand some information is vital to you,” Su Nantian said. “I would not force you to sell it, but Wang Bo and Li Zhe are certainly not without other conflicts. Over time, new tensions will arise.” He said this while smiling.

Liang Bo exhaled deeply. In their brief exchange, he had already recognized Su Nantian as a shrewd individual. If he informed Zhang Yuan, the latter would advise him to withdraw from this contest. Remaining neutral would allow him to avoid both loss and gain, but if he entered the fray, it was likely that everyone in the inland port would suffer.

Thus, Liang Bo said, “I can sell you this information, but there are rules. You must not reveal where you obtained it. After the exchange of money and information, we will act as if we never met. Your position here is already precarious; I have no desire to be entangled with you. If you need me again, call this number—but do not come looking for me like today.”

As he spoke, Liang Bo waved his phone to indicate they should exchange numbers. Clearly, the number on his phone was private and not known to others; otherwise, how could he maintain such discreet contact with Su Nantian?

“What is the price?” Su Nantian asked after exchanging numbers.

“Ten thousand.” Liang Bo replied without hesitation. Su Nantian was taken aback; he had not expected this information to be so valuable. Yet, after considering it, he suspected Liang Bo was overcharging. After all, his access to information at the dock was limited, so this price seemed unusually high.

But since it was Nan Gong Fei who would cover the cost, Su Nantian had no reason to hesitate. He nodded in agreement.

After transferring the money, Liang Bo confirmed receipt and said, “Actually, Wang Bo and Li Zhe do not have much conflict. However, they do differ on one matter. After all, we are all rough men who have worked at the docks for years; even now, we remain crude.

They often visit a massage parlor. You know what that implies. Moreover, both have been pursuing the same woman, but neither has succeeded yet. They regard each other as rivals and enemies. Combined with past conflicts, mentioning this woman will certainly provoke them.”

After hearing Liang Bo’s words, Su Nantian smiled. He had not expected it to be such a trivial matter, but for him, this was easier to manage. After all, the saying “men are creatures of their lower halves” was not without truth.

“Give me the address and her name,” Su Nantian continued.

But Liang Bo smiled and said, “That’s an additional cost. If you wish to know her location, name, and details, you’ll need to pay more.”

Su Nantian chuckled. He had not expected Liang Bo to be such a shrewd businessman.

Chapter 571: Playing Along

Since Su Nantian needed the information, he did not hesitate to pay. After adding two thousand more, he obtained the contact details and location of the massage parlor’s female staff.

As Su Nantian was about to leave, Liang Bo suddenly said, “One more thing—If you come in a hurry today, they are open all night. And from what I know, neither Wang Bo nor Li Zhe has come in today. If you visit at another time, you might run into them.” He added with a sly smile.

“Is this information free?” Su Nantian chuckled and then turned to leave.

This information was indeed useful for Su Nantian, so he did not return to the Nan Gong estate but instead drove directly to the massage parlor based on Liang Bo’s address.

As expected, it was an all-night establishment. Upon entering, a staff member approached him immediately and asked what service he required.

Su Nantian first surveyed the parlor’s environment, which was indeed one of the more upscale venues in the area.

“I need a massage,” Su Nantian said.

“Would you like a recommendation or to choose yourself?” the staff asked again.

“Number thirty-eight.”

After saying this, Su Nantian prepared to enter. At that moment, the staff smiled and said, “I need to inform you—number thirty-eight is a senior masseuse. You’ll need to pay extra, understood?”

Su Nantian nodded, and the staff smiled as he led Su Nantian into the room.

Su Nantian did not wait long before the door was knocked on, and a woman entered. Su Nantian had to admit she was quite attractive.

However, he did not allow her the chance to give him a massage. He immediately approached and locked the door. The woman was surprised, and Su Nantian quickly said, “I came here specifically to find you. I’m not here for a massage.”

The woman looked puzzled and examined Su Nantian carefully before saying, “Sorry, have we met before?”

“No, I came here specifically to find you. I know two men are pursuing you—one named Li Zhe, the other Wang Bo. Is that correct?”

Su Nantian asked without hesitation, as he knew this woman had not accepted their advances.

Upon hearing the names Li Zhe and Wang Bo, the masseuse’s face clearly showed several expressions of disdain, though fleeting. Yet Su Nantian caught them.

It seemed their relationship was indeed as Su Nantian had suspected—Li Zhe and Wang Bo’s pursuit was entirely one-sided, while the woman aimed for something higher. She had no intention of yielding to either man, still dreaming of ascending from her current station.

“You must be mistaken,” the woman said as she sat on the sofa, crossing her legs with an air of impatience. “I don’t accept their proposals. If you’re here to speak on their behalf, then forget it. You can be a guest, but trying to take me in would be impossible.”

The woman’s words made Su Nantian realize that both men had attempted to take her in.

Yet it was understandable—given Wang Bo and Li Zhe’s ages, they likely had wives and children back home. However, those families were probably in their hometowns, while the two men resided here. Now that they had become leaders of the inland port, they sought to display their status by taking a mistress.

And it was no coincidence that both rivals had such intentions, leading to inevitable conflicts between them.

“I misunderstood,” Su Nantian said with a smile. “I’m not here to speak for them. I want you to help me stage a performance.”

“Performance? I don’t have time for your games. Do you know how much I earn here daily?” The woman’s attitude toward Su Nantian had already soured after he mentioned Wang Bo and Li Zhe.

“How about two thousand?” Su Nantian said, raising two fingers.

“Two thousand? At least five thousand.”

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian was taken aback. He had meant two ten-thousands by raising two fingers, but the woman only asked for two thousand.

So Su Nantian smiled and said, “Fine—let me give you ten thousand directly. This matter must remain secret. If you leak it, the consequences are yours to bear. You understand what I mean?”

As Su Nantian spoke, his expression grew increasingly sinister. Women in massage parlors had encountered all sorts of men, especially those involved in the underworld. He knew exactly what this payment meant.

“You can rest assured,” she said. “I always take money for my work. And I’ll tell you—both of these men are utterly detestable. If you can use this opportunity to eliminate them, I’ll be even happier.”

Upon hearing her words, Su Nantian smiled and transferred five thousand immediately. “This is the deposit. I’ll return in a few days. For now, don’t leave the massage parlor—especially at this time. Make sure to keep your schedule open.”

After hearing this, the woman nodded, and Su Nantian stepped out.

After leaving the massage parlor, Su Nantian returned to the Nan Gong estate. However, as he stepped out of his car and prepared to return to Nan Gong Ping’s villa, he heard someone calling him. The voice was very familiar.

Su Nantian turned and saw a person standing in the shadows beneath a tree—this was Nan Gong Yu Yan.

“Miss Nan Gong, you called me?” Su Nantian asked, pointing at himself in confusion.

“Who else is here besides you? Do I speak to the air?” Nan Gong Yu Yan stepped out from under the tree and smiled.

“No, I’m just curious—why are you still here at this hour? And what did you need from me?” Su Nantian scratched his head, looking puzzled.

Su Nantian felt that Nan Gong Yu Yan had been waiting for him specifically, but upon thinking again, he found it unlikely. What merit did he have to warrant the attention of Nan Gong’s daughter? Especially since he was merely a bodyguard for the Nan Gong family.

Chapter 572: Constraints

Nan Gong Yu Yan smiled at Su Nantian’s foolish expression and said, “When Nan Gong Fei returned earlier today, I came to find you. I discovered you hadn’t come back yet and later learned you had gone out on a mission. I heard from Nan Gong Fei that after your visit, they caused trouble again?”

Su Nantian suddenly understood. After all, the inland port was under Nan Gong Yu Yan’s responsibility. The events of today had disrupted progress, and ultimately, it would be Nan Gong Yu Yan who faced blame from Nan Gong Lin. Meanwhile, they would not face any trouble.

Thus, Su Nantian nodded and said, “Yes, after our visit, we found all the reports were empty. These people deliberately printed new blank reports. They refused to hand over those with data, claiming they had none. This made it impossible to proceed with the next steps. The ships’ arrivals could only record current data, but all prior cooperation was unknown. Since accounting wasn’t done incrementally, by year-end we would lose this profit entirely.”

Su Nantian understood Zhang Yuan’s and Wang Bo’s and Li Zhe’s intentions. Their goal was to test them, to see how they would react. If Su Nantian and his team remained silent, it would mean losing a portion of the profit. That loss would then belong to the three men.

In short, money was the root of all. These three had no real reason to trouble them, and they were already aware of Wu Chuan’s and Nan Gong Yu Yan’s relationship.

After hearing this, Nan Gong Yu Yan frowned and said angrily, “These people just want to hoard money. They’re despicable. What do you plan to do now?”

“Only by outwitting them can we resolve this. Today, Nan Gong Fei almost got into a fight. If it had escalated, the day would have been ruined. Now we cannot confront them directly; we must sow discord within their ranks.”

From what he knew, these three men had internal conflicts. They had only united for mutual benefit this time. Though they seemed unbreakable, their alliance was actually fragile. If we could break them one by one, there would be a chance to turn the situation around.”

Nan Gong Yu Yan listened to Su Nantian’s analysis and suddenly remembered how he had previously demonstrated his talent. He often had ideas of his own, and some of his strategies were quite effective—far from the image she initially had of him as a mere brawn-heavy bodyguard.

Yet, Nan Gong Yu Yan already harbored feelings for Su Nantian. As she listened to his words, her gaze softened as she stared at his face. Su Nantian was taken aback; he had never seen Nan Gong Yu Yan look at him this way.

Moreover, Su Nantian felt that she had not heard a word he said afterward, as if lost in her own thoughts. So he waved his hand before her face and said, “Miss Nan Gong, can you hear me? What are you thinking about?”

Nan Gong Yu Yan finally snapped out of it, her face turning red. She said awkwardly, “Oh, I’m fine—just thought of something else. I didn’t catch the rest of what you said, sorry.”

“You probably haven’t rested well. It’s already late. You should go back and rest,” Su Nantian said, not suspecting anything. He felt it was already late, and if Nan Gong Yu Yan had waited for him, she must have expended a lot of energy. So he suggested she go back to rest.

“Still, about the inland port—what are you planning?” After Nan Gong Yu Yan nodded and was about to leave, she suddenly remembered this was the most important issue. So she turned back and said.

“First, we need to stir up their internal conflicts. We must break this seemingly unbreakable alliance. If they don’t collapse, we’ll have no way to proceed. Once their unity is shattered, they will inevitably turn against each other for profit. Then it would be beneficial to us. We can also offer them some conditions, giving them a taste of benefits. The rest will be easy.”

This was Su Nantian’s plan so far, though it had not been implemented yet. However, he felt the chances of success were high. A union was no threat if each party harbored their own intentions. One day, it would be shattered.

Nan Gong Yu Yan nodded and said, “You go ahead then. I have other things to do these days. I’ll also check the inland port later. If it’s not resolved by then, I’ll discuss strategies with you.”

“By the way, Nan Gong Fei—my cousin is always impulsive. He’s been idle all his life. So you’ll have to make your own decisions. Although his position is higher than yours, I think you should manage him a bit.”

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian looked troubled. “After all, I’m just a bodyguard of the Nan Gong family. My current position at the inland port is lower than Nan Gong Fei’s. No matter what, I am under his command. How can I manage him like this…”

Su Nantian said this while frowning, looking as if he couldn’t do it.

Nan Gong Yu Yan thought for a moment and said, “You can go ahead. Just don’t harm him physically. For the inland port matters, you have full autonomy and can intervene appropriately. This gives you a lot of freedom and power.”

“Is that what you said?” Su Nantian confirmed again. He had long disliked Nan Gong Fei but was constrained by his position, so he could only turn a blind eye and even flatter him.

“Yes, I said it. But you can’t retaliate against him recklessly. Correct his mistakes if he makes them. Of course, for his private life, you don’t need to interfere at all. It’s limited to the inland port matters. Do you understand?” Nan Gong Yu Yan said.

Chapter 573: The Revelation

Su Nantian had essentially made three rules with Nan Gong Yu Yan. As long as he did not physically harm Nan Gong Fei, he could freely handle the inland port matters and intervene appropriately. This gave him a significant amount of autonomy and power, which was also a form of authority.

After Su Nantian said goodbye to Nan Gong Yu Yan and returned to the villa, he found that Nan Gong Ping was still sitting in the living room.

“Master, it’s so late—why don’t you rest?” Su Nantian said respectfully.

“Why was your sister looking for you?” Clearly, Nan Gong Ping had seen Nan Gong Yu Yan speaking with Su Nantian.

Su Nantian was taken aback and immediately replied, “We were discussing the inland port matters. I returned late today because I had other things to do, so she waited a while.”

“Is the situation at the inland port not optimistic?” Upon hearing this, Nan Gong Ping seemed concerned and asked.

“Three local gangsters have banded together to deliberately trouble us, but we now have a solution. It should be resolved soon,” Su Nantian said truthfully. There was no need to hide these matters from Nan Gong Ping.

“If there’s a cousin like me in front of them, it would be difficult to handle things. But you can rest assured—if this is done well, I’ll praise it in front of Father. If you truly have talent and aren’t limited to being a bodyguard, I can recommend you for a position in the Nan Gong company.”

Nan Gong Ping had long wanted this. When they were at the Wu family, Nan Gong Ping felt Su Nantian was no ordinary person. Besides his combat skills, he also had strategies.

Moreover, when Su Nantian handled a task alone, it was excellent—such as the case with the Sea King Gang. The Nan Gong family had failed to resolve it for years, but Su Nantian solved it in a few days.

Because of these events, Nan Gong Ping felt even more that Su Nantian could be his right-hand man. Not only to protect his safety, but if he could manage his business affairs, it would be a stronger assistant.

After all, Nan Gong Ping knew he was not as skilled in business as Nan Gong Yu Yan. Thus, he needed people to help him.

This was also one of Nan Gong Ping’s strengths—clearly recognizing his own shortcomings and knowing how to compensate for them.

Su Nantian nodded and said, “Master, rest assured I won’t disappoint you.”

Upon hearing Su Nantian’s words, Nan Gong Ping nodded happily and said, “Alright, you should rest early. You have to go again tomorrow—辛苦了 (hard work).”

After saying this, Nan Gong Ping turned and walked upstairs. But as he stepped onto the stairs, he suddenly turned back to look at Su Nantian and said, “By the way, we only talked about business matters. Are you two having something wrong?”

Su Nantian was confused and said, “Master, what do you mean? Me and Miss Nan Gong…”

Su Nantian had felt something strange recently, as if Nan Gong Yu Yan was pursuing some other goal. He thought about it a lot and even wondered if she had discovered his identity, but after some time of interaction, he was certain that Nan Gong Yu Yan hadn’t.

Yet now Nan Gong Ping said this, and Su Nantian was quite confused.

“You really are a thick-headed person. Never mind, go to sleep. You should also rest early.” Nan Gong Ping sighed and said, then continued walking upstairs.

Upon hearing Nan Gong Ping’s words, Su Nantian finally realized—was it that Nan Gong Yu Yan liked him? Upon thinking this, he recalled how Nan Gong Yu Yan had blushed slightly earlier. He thought she was unwell, but if she liked him…

Upon thinking this, Su Nantian immediately forced himself to stop. After all, at the moment, dating was not his top priority. His most important task now was to rescue Wu Tao’s family. Before that, he must not let other matters distract his focus.

Moreover, Su Nantian was currently in a disguised state. Nan Gong Yu Yan had never seen his true face and did not understand his real personality.

Thus, Su Nantian felt that under these circumstances, there was no need to respond. He would continue pretending not to understand and focus on reconnecting with the Wu family.

After thinking this through, Su Nantian completely set aside the issue because at that moment, the most direct problem was not this. He needed to make full use of his current resources to break through the situation.

The next day, Su Nantian again took Nan Gong Fei to the inland port.

As they arrived, Nan Gong Fei sat in the back seat and yawned widely before saying lazily, “By the way, what did you do last night?”

Su Nantian drove while responding, “I waited for him at Liang Bo’s house and bought some information. Their three local gangsters’ conflicts were not entirely private, but I asked about their personal lives and intentionally avoided buying information on his boss. I only bought details about Wang Bo and Li Zhe.”

Upon hearing the words “personal life,” Nan Gong Fei’s eyes lit up and he said, “Then tell me what you found out.”

Su Nantian glanced at Nan Gong Fei’s excited expression in the rearview mirror and sighed inwardly. This Nan Gong Fei was truly uneducated, showing such interest in this kind of thing.

“They both pursued the same woman and wanted her to be their mistress. However, this woman didn’t like either of them and aimed for a higher branch,” Su Nantian said. “But on the surface, she couldn’t say it outright, so both men thought they were in a tug-of-war. They didn’t realize she disliked both of them.”

Su Nantian said this while smiling.

Chapter 574: Heartbreak

Upon hearing Su Nantian’s words, Nan Gong Fei was extremely excited. At that moment, he seemed to have discovered a new world and was very interested in this matter.

Su Nantian noticed Nan Gong Fei’s interest and felt a bit startled. He thought about what Nan Gong Yu Yan had said before—she could assign tasks to him. Thus, he felt it was better not to involve Nan Gong Fei in this matter. He thought that if Nan Gong Fei got involved, it would likely cause his plan to fail.

Indeed, immediately after that, Nan Gong Fei asked Su Nantian eagerly, “Nantian, do you need my help? Just say it.”

Su Nantian could only give a standard smile and said, “Master just needs to sit back and relax. The rest of the matters can be fully entrusted to me without your direct involvement.”

Su Nantian felt that the more Nan Gong Fei was interested, the more he would want to get involved. This would ultimately lead to failure. However, this matter was extremely important for them, so Su Nantian would not allow Nan Gong Fei to interfere with his plan.

But Su Nantian’s words were well-received, and Nan Gong Fei thought about it for a moment before saying, “What you said is right. This kind of thing doesn’t need me to go out in the open. Just sit back and relax. I’ll wait for your good news.”

Su Nantian smiled and said, “But during this time, I hope Master can control your temper. Don’t act recklessly like last time. Can you promise me that?”

However, Nan Gong Fei was one who preferred to be treated gently rather than harshly. Thus, Su Nantian’s polite request was acceptable and did not feel offended. If Su Nantian had directly ordered him or commanded him not to do something, Nan Gong Fei might have even fought with Su Nantian.

“Alright, since it’s for our plan, I’ll make a compromise. I’ll just pretend they don’t exist,” Nan Gong Fei nodded seriously.

After Su Nantian heard this, he felt that his internal matters were resolved. As long as Nan Gong Fei did not interfere or hinder him, the plan would definitely be executed perfectly.

When Su Nantian and Nan Gong Fei arrived at the office, they found the door open but no one inside. However, it was clear that someone had been there—so Zhang Yuan, Wang Bo, and Li Zhe must have come and then left immediately, as if they looked down on them.

“These people are all quite temperamental. I didn’t expect that after we arrived, they simply left the office.” Nan Gong Fei said upon entering, crossing his arms and speaking mockingly. But it was clear he was angry.

After all, the inland port matters were now under their control by the Nan Gong family. As the second-in-command after Nan Gong Yu Yan, he was insulted by their lack of respect.

Su Nantian saw Nan Gong Fei’s anger again and quickly said, “Master, don’t be angry. Why argue with these people? I told you already—your most important task now is to sit back and relax.”

Su Nantian felt he was extremely busy, not only having to plan the next steps but also having to pacify Nan Gong Fei, a difficult person. He had realized that he could neither beat nor scold him; he could only pacify him.

“Alright, since I’ve agreed with you, I won’t break my promise,” Nan Gong Fei said impatiently and waved his hand before storming into his office and slamming the door shut.

It was no exaggeration that Nan Gong Fei locking himself in his office made Su Nantian feel safe. At least, he would not clash with anyone else.

Although Su Nantian had already planned his next steps, they could not sit idly by. Doing so would only raise suspicion from Zhang Yuan, Wang Bo, and Li Zhe. The reports were too suspicious to be ignored entirely.

Moreover, Su Nantian also wanted to get close and observe Wang Bo and Li Zhe’s personalities. This would help him with his next steps.

Although Su Nantian had already contacted the woman, he hadn’t acted yet because he wanted to observe Wang Bo and Li Zhe’s usual behaviors first. This would help him design the plan better.

Thus, Su Nantian sat in the office and flipped through some papers before getting up and heading out. He needed to have a direct encounter with Wang Bo and Li Zhe.

Additionally, when Su Nantian had met Liang Bo earlier, he had also inquired about the current power dynamics within the inland port. Zhang Yuan was the strongest, followed by Wang Bo, and finally Li Zhe.

Thus, Su Nantian felt he could start from these aspects. Li Zhe was the weakest and would grasp this opportunity to unite, making him less likely to be shaken. However, he would also worry about being abandoned. But this only caused panic after other signs appeared.

As for Zhang Yuan, he was currently out of Su Nantian’s consideration. After all, his information came from Liang Bo, and it would be more disadvantageous to target Zhang Yuan.

Therefore, Su Nantian felt that Wang Bo, who was in the second position, was his best target. This middle ground made him more suspicious.

After all, he had Zhang Yuan above him but could still outdo Li Zhe. This position of being neither the best nor the worst was truly anxiety-inducing.

Thus, Su Nantian felt that starting with Wang Bo was a wise choice. Moreover, he had no intention of breaking the current power structure in the inland port; that was a difficult task. Even if he wanted to do so one day, it would require long-term preparation.

At the moment, Su Nantian only wanted to break up their temporary alliance. He needed to incite their conflicts, even if it didn’t require direct confrontation on the surface. Just making them wary of each other would suffice.

This was the kind of court intrigue that could destroy their current alliance.

Chapter 575: Thoughts in the Heart
