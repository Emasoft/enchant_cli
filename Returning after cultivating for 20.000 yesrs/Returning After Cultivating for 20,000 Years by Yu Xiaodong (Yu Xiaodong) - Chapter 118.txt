“Alright, since you say that, I’ll make the decision for you. Wang Bo, are you willing to swear that everything you said is true? If it’s false, you’ll bear great responsibility. After all, everyone has overcome countless difficulties to form this alliance. You’re deliberately sowing discord among us.”

Zhang Yuan was well aware that within the Inland Port, his faction ranked first, Wang Bo’s second, and Li Zhe’s third. Therefore, no matter what, Zhang Yuan would maintain a relatively amicable relationship with Li Zhe while subtly distancing himself from Wang Bo, fearing that any shift in power might threaten his position. In this incident, he naturally leaned slightly toward Li Zhe, yet he also believed Wang Bo wouldn’t have made such claims without evidence. However, with both sides clashing in their accounts, he could not reach a conclusion. Since Li Zhe had proposed this method, he decided to go along with it.

After hearing this, Wang Bo nodded and said, “If that’s the case, I accept. We formed an alliance to protect mutual interests. Yet this time, a traitor leaked the reports, which is unforgivable. Although you’ve challenged me to prove it, let’s see who speaks the truth. Lies will inevitably be exposed.”

After Wang Bo spoke, he immediately turned to his subordinate behind him and whispered a few words. The subordinate then pulled out his phone, revealing an image clearly showing Li Zhe and Nan Gong Fei sitting together, laughing and conversing.

Upon seeing this, Zhang Yuan was stunned. He hadn’t expected Wang Bo to actually obtain evidence, nor had he realized Li Zhe was lying. “What’s going on? You said there was a video, right? Show it again.”

Wang Bo’s subordinate then played the recorded video on his phone. The footage clearly showed Nan Gong Fei and Li Zhe engaged in lively conversation.

“This… this… I remember now. That night, I went to the massage city and met Nan Gong Fei. He sat beside me, and we exchanged a few words. There was nothing more to it.”

Li Zhe only now recalled the events of that night. As he often visited the massage city and habitually drank, that evening had left him slightly inebriated. He’d forgotten meeting Nan Gong Fei entirely, but now, seeing the photo and video, he suddenly remembered.

“I think you’re grasping at straws. What did you say earlier? I’ve already stated these pieces of evidence don’t prove you sold data to Nan Gong Fei. Yet your behavior was suspicious. Initially, you denied it outright and accused me of slandering you. You simply assumed I had no proof. But now, with the evidence before us, you claim it was an accidental meeting. Are your interactions truly so innocent?”

After hearing Wang Bo’s words, Li Zhe’s excuses were dismantled one by one. His speech before the crowd now seemed a feeble attempt to cover his tracks. Even Zhang Yuan furrowed his brow, gazing at Li Zhe with disappointment.

“Li Zhe, Li Zhe. I never expected you to act this way. If you had confessed from the start, perhaps we might have believed your encounter was genuine. But by concealing it for so long, your lies were inevitably exposed.”

Chapter 586: A Thousand Words Cannot Defend

At this moment, Li Zhe truly felt like he had no way to defend himself. He had genuinely forgotten that he had met Nan Gong Fei before, as it had occurred during a moment of complete relaxation. They had merely exchanged a few casual words.

Although Li Zhe was aware that he should not associate with the Nan Gong family within the Inland Port, in private they had never discussed business matters—only casual conversation. Thus, Li Zhe hadn’t shown any hostility but had instead maintained a relatively amicable rapport.

Yet he had never anticipated that such a minor incident would become evidence of his treachery. This felt entirely disproportionate, as if the situation had been exaggerated unnecessarily.

Moreover, Li Zhe noticed that the photos and videos were extremely clear, as if someone had been waiting for him specifically. He felt certain he was being manipulated, and the perpetrator was none other than Wang Bo.

“Believe me! I’ve had no secret dealings with the Nan Gong family. That was truly an accidental meeting, and we only spoke about trivial matters. Look at these photos and videos—they’re so clear. Someone must have been waiting for me! It’s definitely Wang Bo! He sent someone to entrap me!”

Li Zhe spoke with great indignation, glaring at Wang Bo and shouting, “Why are you trying to destroy me? Why!”

As he spoke, Li Zhe lunged forward to grab Wang Bo’s collar and strike him. However, Wang Bo swiftly dodged back several steps, preventing Li Zhe from succeeding.

“Li Zhe, are you mad after being exposed? You’re trying to shift blame onto me. If I truly had orchestrated this, could I have predicted Nan Gong Fei would sit beside you and speak with you? Or do you think I could manipulate Nan Gong Fei to approach you? If I had such power, why would I still be stuck here in the Inland Port instead of joining the Nan Gong family?”

After dodging, Wang Bo adjusted his disheveled clothes and said with resentment.

What Wang Bo had said seemed entirely reasonable to others, further highlighting Li Zhe’s desperate and irrational claims. After all, as Wang Bo had stated, he could not control Nan Gong Fei. If he could, he wouldn’t have remained a lowly worker in the Inland Port but would have already joined the Nan Gong family.

“Enough! This is too disgraceful. If you truly did it, I advise you to confess immediately. With all this evidence before us, you have no way to defend yourself. We are brothers and currently in an alliance. This alliance was just formed, yet this incident has already occurred. How can we trust each other now? We all came together for mutual benefit, to make decisions on equal footing. But you were the first to betray our trust.”

Zhang Yuan said this while shaking his head in disappointment. All the evidence clearly showed that Li Zhe had done it, and even his desperate outburst made it impossible to doubt his guilt.

“People die for wealth; birds perish for food. It seems the Nan Gong family must have offered you a substantial sum,” Wang Bo added, stoking the fire. He knew that money was always an unresolved issue among the three of them. Now, despite their outward harmony, a real conflict would likely be even more intense.

Especially after Wang Bo’s words, the other brothers who had remained silent now glared at Li Zhe with anger. One even spoke out: “You handed over our data to the Nan Gong family, so they must have given you a lot of money. Or did they promise you something to dominate in the Inland Port!”

They had already concluded that Li Zhe was responsible. Since he hadn’t done it without reason, there must have been a deal between them. Thus, they were certain Li Zhe had received considerable money or other benefits.

“I didn’t! I really didn’t! I’ve said it so many times. This wasn’t me, and I haven’t had any contact with the Nan Gong family. They didn’t give me money or anything! Believe me!”

Li Zhe continued to struggle, hoping someone would believe him and speak on his behalf. He gazed at Zhang Yuan with desperate eyes, but Zhang Yuan avoided his gaze and shook his head in disappointment.

In fact, before this, Zhang Yuan’s plan had been to maintain a superficial alliance while secretly conspiring with Li Zhe against Wang Bo. Once Wang Bo’s faction was defeated, they would divide his power and strengthen their own position. With Li Zhe as a subordinate, he could turn a blind eye, ensuring Zhang Yuan would become the undisputed leader of the Inland Port with greater stability.

But this time, Zhang Yuan could no longer trust Li Zhe. He had assumed their alliance was the most solid, yet Li Zhe had betrayed them for money or benefits. He realized that although Li Zhe was the weakest, he now used their alliance to curry favor with the Nan Gong family and gained considerable benefits. From now on, he could no longer fully trust him, and perhaps the next threat would come from Li Zhe.

“Enough. Let’s leave it at that. Now that the data has reached the Nan Gong family, there’s no point in continuing to berate Li Zhe,” Zhang Yuan said, shaking his head.

Upon hearing this, Wang Bo felt a flicker of doubt. Why did Zhang Yuan’s words sound like he was about to forgive Li Zhe, as if nothing had happened? Hadn’t all his efforts been in vain?

Before Wang Bo could speak, someone else had already voiced their opinion: “Are you really going to forgive him? We disagree!”

After this person spoke, the others nodded in agreement and raised their arms, shouting: “We cannot forgive him!”

Chapter 587: Decision

Seeing so many people clamoring to refuse forgiveness for Li Zhe, Wang Bo felt a surge of satisfaction. He knew his goal had been achieved, but he could not show any joy on the surface. Instead, he feigned deep sorrow, as if watching Li Zhe with disappointment.

After everyone spoke, they all looked to Zhang Yuan. Although it was an alliance, he remained the de facto leader due to his largest faction and greatest influence.

“Zhang Yuan, what should we do about this?” One bold person directly asked, then glared at Li Zhe with resentment.

After all, they were workers in the Inland Port who relied on this for their livelihood. If the alliance’s rules were broken, they would inevitably face oppression from the Nan Gong family. Thus, they deeply despised Li Zhe’s actions.

After hearing their words, Zhang Yuan shook his head in resignation and glanced at Wang Bo before saying: “I can’t decide this alone. After all, it’s a tripartite alliance. Since Li Zhe has caused trouble, the final decision must be made by both me and Wang Bo.”

After saying this, Zhang Yuan turned to Wang Bo and asked: “Wang Bo, what’s your opinion on this?”

Wang Bo scratched his head and said: “If Li Zhe had confessed immediately and apologized, we could pretend this never happened. After all, the incident has already occurred, and as a brother, it would only weaken our strength. But he continued to argue and seemed unrepentant. Therefore, I can only say I won’t forgive him.”

Wang Bo didn’t specify the punishment but simply stated he wouldn’t forgive Li Zhe. However, this refusal implied expelling Li Zhe from the alliance.

Wang Bo knew he couldn’t directly take over Li Zhe’s faction, but isolating him from the alliance was beneficial. This way, Li Zhe’s faction couldn’t unite with Zhang Yuan, securing his position and preventing Zhang Yuan from acting against him. It would restore the previous tripartite balance, albeit with Li Zhe now in a more passive position.

After hearing Wang Bo’s words, Zhang Yuan nodded in agreement and said: “Then let’s follow the people’s will. From now on, Li Zhe is no longer part of our alliance. As for the rest of you, continue with your plans as before. Li Zhe, whatever you do from now on—whether you ally with the Nan Gong family or stay quiet—it has nothing to do with us.”

After saying this, Zhang Yuan shook his head and sighed before leaving the room without giving Li Zhe another chance to speak. Zhang Yuan’s people also quickly withdrew.

After seeing Zhang Yuan leave, Li Zhe rushed to Wang Bo and grabbed his collar: “It was you who framed me! Tell me, why did you frame me? Is it meaningful to do this at such a time? Or have you already colluded with the Nan Gong family!”

Wang Bo merely frowned and pushed Li Zhe’s hand away, saying: “Stay rational. Don’t fall into paranoia. How could I have any connection with the Nan Gong family? You should ask yourself what relationship you have with them. We’re leaving!”

After saying this, Wang Bo also pushed Li Zhe away and left the room with his people. Only Li Zhe and those under him remained.

Those under Li Zhe naturally couldn’t leave, as they were his subordinates. Even though he had been expelled from the alliance, they wouldn’t be accepted by it either. To survive, they would have to continue following Li Zhe.

In fact, these people had no real feelings for the Nan Gong family or the alliance. They simply wanted to survive, and even if they won this battle, their workers wouldn’t gain a single penny.

“Boss, what should we do now?” One asked.

“What else can we do? It’s already like this,” Li Zhe shook his head and said.

Chapter 588: Deployment

This plan had clearly been a victory for Wang Bo, but the greater gain was undoubtedly for Su Nantian and his group. After all, this situation had been meticulously orchestrated by Su Nantian from the beginning, and it perfectly aligned with his original plan.

Upon learning of Su Nantian’s success in dismantling the alliance, Nan Gong Yu Yan immediately called Nan Gong Fei and Su Nantian to hold a meeting, discussing their next steps in the Inland Port.

For Nan Gong Fei, this was a fresh and exciting experience. For years, he had never been invited to such an important meeting before.

Nan Gong Yu Yan observed Nan Gong Fei and Su Nantian, then nodded: “Alright, both of you sit down.”

In fact, Nan Gong Yu Yan had only previously trusted Su Nantian. However, since Nan Gong Fei was his superior in some way, she had also invited him. As long as he didn’t cause trouble, she had no objections.

“First, let’s commend Su Nantian for his plan. It has successfully dismantled their alliance. The Inland Port is no longer impenetrable, and our forces can gradually infiltrate it. Although we’ve only been here for a year, we must ensure maximum profit for the Nan Gong family. We cannot let their alliance hinder our gains.”

Su Nantian nodded in agreement with Nan Gong Yu Yan’s words.

“Alright, now both of you tell me: since we’ve already dismantled their alliance, what are your plans moving forward?” After saying this, Nan Gong Yu Yan looked at both Nan Gong Fei and Su Nantian to see their thoughts. Naturally, she was mainly interested in Su Nantian’s opinion but couldn’t ignore Nan Gong Fei entirely, as it would be disrespectful.

Moreover, she noticed that Nan Gong Fei was unusually excited today. It seemed he had high expectations for this meeting.

“Although the alliance has been dismantled, Wang Bo’s faction still officially allies with Zhang Yuan. Therefore, we can continue to cooperate with Wang Bo and use his strength to dismantle Zhang Yuan’s faction. We previously investigated that among the three of them, Zhang Yuan had the strongest power. Therefore, we must eliminate part of his strength first. I think we should continue to cooperate with Wang Bo since we’ve already had a precedent of cooperation, and this time it should be trustworthy.”

Nan Gong Fei was the first to voice his opinion. To Nan Gong Yu Yan’s surprise, she hadn’t expected Nan Gong Fei to say such words. She had always thought he was just idling around, but now he seemed genuinely thinking about these issues. Moreover, his method was indeed feasible since they had already cooperated before and knew each other well. Plus, she still held evidence against Wang Bo, so he wouldn’t dare act recklessly.

But this wasn’t the best plan. If Nan Gong Yu Yan had her way, she felt this plan was still lacking something.

At that moment, Nan Gong Fei looked proud and confident, gazing at Nan Gong Yu Yan with a sense of accomplishment. He seemed quite pleased with his own insight.

Nan Gong Yu Yan, seeing Nan Gong Fei’s eager-to-be-praised expression, could only sigh helplessly and clapped her hands. “Your uncle said it well. I think your method is indeed good. However, I also want to hear what Su Nantian thinks. I’d like to see if his plan is the same as yours.”

After praising Nan Gong Fei, Nan Gong Yu Yan quickly shifted the topic and turned to Su Nantian: “Su Nantian, what are your thoughts now?”

After hearing this, Su Nantian nodded and said: “The master’s suggestion is indeed a method. However, considering our special circumstances here, this plan can only be a backup option.”

Hearing Su Nantian’s words, Nan Gong Fei felt somewhat upset. After all, this plan was the result of his careful consideration for a long time. He had spoken it out and was eager to be acknowledged.

“What’s your plan then?” Nan Gong Fei asked. He had forgotten that this entire plan was entirely Su Nantian’s design, and he hadn’t done anything but follow Su Nantian’s instructions to chat with these two people.

After hearing this, Su Nantian smiled and explained his current thoughts.

“I think we shouldn’t continue cooperating with Wang Bo. We’ve already had one cooperation, and having his weakness is enough. Our current goal isn’t to seize the Inland Port entirely since it has always belonged to the Wu family. What we need is for no one to oppose us here this year, and maximize our profits.”

Su Nantian analyzed the current situation. After hearing this, Nan Gong Yu Yan nodded in agreement. Her thoughts so far had aligned with Su Nantian’s.

They didn’t need to seize the Inland Port, as they couldn’t. This industry was the Wu family’s most important asset.

“Continue,” Nan Gong Yu Yan nodded and said.

“Wang Bo has already cooperated with us, which proves he no longer trusts the alliance. Although he still officially remains in it, his dissatisfaction with Zhang Yuan is no less than his dislike for Li Zhe. Therefore, this alliance is already defunct in name only. We don’t need to continue cooperating with Wang Bo or deliberately destroy this alliance.

On the contrary, if this alliance were truly broken, it would raise Zhang Yuan’s vigilance and might not be beneficial for our future developments.

Moreover, since we’ve already obtained evidence against Wang Bo, everyone believes the data leak was Li Zhe’s doing and he has been expelled from the alliance. I think Wang Bo wouldn’t want people to realize it was actually him.

Therefore, we now have this leverage, and Wang Bo is naturally on the same side as us.”

Chapter 589: A New Path

Everything Su Nantian said resonated deeply with Nan Gong Yu Yan. She fully agreed with all of Su Nantian’s analyses.

Su Nantian continued to follow his plan: “Therefore, at this moment, if we want to strengthen our position and advantage in the Inland Port, we shouldn’t seek cooperation with Wang Bo but instead look for Li Zhe.”

“What? Cooperate with Li Zhe? But we just had a falling out with him. He knows he was expelled from the alliance because of being framed, and this incident must have made him resent us. How could he cooperate with us?”

Nan Gong Fei was confused upon hearing Su Nantian’s suggestion. He didn’t understand the situation and thought he should continue cooperating with Wang Bo, but Su Nantian now suggested cooperation with Li Zhe. This seemed incredibly absurd to him, and he thought this plan was impossible since he believed Li Zhe would never cooperate with them.

“Exactly, you didn’t hear wrong. It’s Li Zhe we need to cooperate with,” Su Nantian nodded, confirming his previous statement.

“Let’s not talk about how this cooperation would work. Just consider whether Li Zhe can cooperate with us at this moment. He was just expelled from the alliance because of us, and he must be furious. How could he cooperate with you?”

Nan Gong Fei continued to voice his doubts, thinking this was impossible.

Meanwhile, Nan Gong Yu Yan watched silently without speaking or intervening. However, he found this situation quite astonishing.

Previously, everyone in the Nan Gong family knew that Nan Gong Fei was a failure who had no talent in anything. He was known for idling around, eating and drinking all day. But now he had analyzed these matters with logic and reason, and his analysis was quite correct—though not as profound as Su Nantian’s. His method was feasible but not the top choice.

That was why Nan Gong Yu Yan was amazed at how Nan Gong Fei had changed. Although he still seemed naive, he was much better than before.

At this moment, Su Nantian answered Nan Gong Fei’s question: “He might initially refuse to cooperate with us, but in the end, he will. These people only care about profit. They formed an alliance because they thought we would cut off their profits after arriving in the Inland Port. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have hidden the data. Therefore, as long as there is profit, Li Zhe will definitely cooperate with us. Especially now that he has been expelled from the alliance, to maintain his position in the Inland Port, he must find a faction to rely on. After all, among the three of them, his faction is the smallest and weakest.”

Su Nantian said confidently. He had thought this through thoroughly, and this cooperation would definitely be the correct approach.

The Nan Gong family’s goal was to maximize profits. That was why they wanted to dismantle their alliance—because the alliance hindered their profits in the Inland Port and created many obstacles.

However, if they could cooperate peacefully with them, the Nan Gong family could restore their profits and possibly expand them.

“So what’s your plan to approach Li Zhe? How will you persuade him?” Nan Gong Yu Yan also raised his question. He hadn’t expected Su Nantian to suggest cooperation with Li Zhe, so he was a bit confused and wanted to hear Su Nantian’s plan.

“Specifically, I haven’t thought it through yet. But once I meet him, I’ll have something to persuade him. Although Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo’s alliance is defunct in name only, they will still target us. Therefore, if we can cooperate with someone who knows the situation well, it would be a great advantage for us.”

Su Nantian wasn’t lying. He hadn’t fully thought through how to persuade him, but if he met Li Zhe in person, he naturally had ways to make Li Zhe listen.

Su Nantian did all this to gain the Nan Gong family’s favor and be included in the project of cooperating with the Wu family. This would give him more opportunities to approach the Wu family and rescue Wu Tao’s couple and Wu You’er.

This was Su Nantian’s most foolish method to save them, as otherwise he had no other way to get close to the major families in the capital.

“How confident are you that you can persuade Li Zhe?” Nan Gong Yu Yan asked cautiously.

“100%,” Su Nantian also replied cautiously. He knew that if he took action, he could convince Li Zhe to side with the Nan Gong family.

Hearing Su Nantian say this, Nan Gong Yu Yan unconditionally believed him. He was also amazed at his trust in Su Nantian, not expecting himself to have such deep faith in him. He believed whatever he said.

Nan Gong Yu Yan was also amazed at this, but more so that in such a short time he had already considered Su Nantian as one of his own, with no feelings of exclusion.

Nan Gong Yu Yan hadn’t interacted with anyone before. He rarely shared information about the Nan Gong family unless there was a collaboration or mutual benefit. But this time, he didn’t know why he had told Su Nantian all the family’s information because of his trust in him.

This made Nan Gong Yu Yan feel surprised about his own feelings. He had already realized he was fond of Su Nantian in a romantic way, but he hadn’t expected his feelings for Su Nantian had already reached this level.

“Are you listening to me?”
While Nan Gong Yu Yan was lost in thought, someone waved their hand in front of her. She snapped out of it and heard Su Nantian saying this to her.

“Sorry, what did you say?” Nan Gong Yu Yan asked.

“I’m asking for permission to approach Li Zhe now. Although Li Zhe has been expelled from their alliance, we don’t need to wait long. We can go directly to negotiate with him without any hesitation. After all, he must have already understood what happened,” Su Nantian replied.

Chapter 590: Official Meeting

After hearing Su Nantian’s words, Nan Gong Yu Yan nodded and said, “Then go find Li Zhe as soon as possible. From what I know, the Inland Port is about to receive a large order previously signed by the Wu family. However, now the profits will belong to us. I’m afraid these people might still manipulate it secretly.”

Nan Gong Yu Yan’s words were not baseless. If the Wu family had still been in charge, they wouldn’t dare to do anything. But now, taking advantage of the chaos during the transfer of accounts and this large order previously negotiated by the Wu family, they had very little information. If these local forces calculated it, they would suffer significant losses.

“I understand. I’ll act immediately. If there’s nothing else, I’ll go find Li Zhe now,” Su Nantian asked Nan Gong Yu Yan’s final opinion.

Nan Gong Yu Yan nodded and said, “There’s nothing else. You can go now. But be careful. After all, there are Li Zhe’s own forces in the Inland Port. If you go alone, it might be dangerous.”

“Don’t worry. I’ll be careful. Then I’m off,” Su Nantian said, nodding to Nan Gong Yu Yan and Nan Gong Fei before leaving.

However, on his way to meet Li Zhe, Su Nantian made a call. The recipient wasn’t Li Zhe but Wang Bo.

“Congratulations, you’ve finally achieved your goal. You’ve successfully expelled Li Zhe from your alliance. He can no longer team up with Zhang Yuan to pressure you,” Su Nantian said cheerfully, first congratulating Wang Bo.

“That’s thanks to your plan. But I assume you didn’t call me just for this. Why go out of your way to send a greeting?” Wang Bo, who was clearly aware that Su Nantian’s call wasn’t good news, asked cautiously to see what Su Nantian had in mind.

“There’s no big issue. I just heard the Inland Port is about to receive a large order. I hope you’ll stay clean and not interfere with it,” Su Nantian said with a smile. This was the real reason for his call to Wang Bo.

Upon hearing this, Wang Bo frowned. He hadn’t expected they had already learned about the news. This large order was previously negotiated by the Wu family, so many details weren’t shared with them.

These local forces could manipulate it to take a large portion of the profits. Although they couldn’t fully seize everything, they could significantly weaken the Nan Gong family’s interests and gain considerable benefits.

“I understand. Don’t worry. Since we’ve had a good cooperation, I won’t bother you this time,” Wang Bo could only nod in response.

At that moment, Su Nantian heard the phone hang up and frowned. He knew Su Nantian’s call wasn’t truly to ask him not to interfere but was a warning to keep his distance from the Nan Gong family’s interests.

However, Wang Bo deeply disliked Su Nantian but was constrained by their previous cooperation. He had a leverage over him, so he couldn’t openly clash with Su Nantian or the Nan Gong family. Thus, Wang Bo had effectively lost his chance to compete for this large order.

After Su Nantian hung up with Wang Bo, he arrived at the Inland Port. This time, Su Nantian directly headed to Li Zhe’s territory.

Since the three of them had already broken their alliance, only Li Zhe’s people remained. Moreover, since Li Zhe was meeting Su Nantian secretly, he wouldn’t tell anyone.

When Li Zhe saw Su Nantian coming to meet him, he was surprised. Internally, he was also angry because it was the Nan Gong family that had caused him to be expelled from the alliance.

“Ah, I don’t know what you’re here for,” Li Zhe asked impatiently. He wished Su Nantian would vanish at that moment.

Su Nantian glanced around and saw Li Zhe had people nearby. He smiled and said, “I came to talk with you. If you’re willing, let them leave.”

Su Nantian knew Li Zhe would talk with him. He was quite confident in waiting.

Li Zhe lowered his head and hesitated for a while, as if struggling with himself. After a while, he finally waved to those around him, signaling them to leave so he could discuss some matters alone with Su Nantian.

After they left, before Su Nantian even spoke, Li Zhe spoke first: “Tell me what you came for. You just framed me to be expelled from the alliance, and now you’re coming back. Are you trying to confirm that I’ve colluded with your Nan Gong family? You and Wang Bo have really gone out of your way.”

Li Zhe was now very indignant, as he had already concluded that this was a joint effort by Wang Bo and the Nan Gong family to frame him.
