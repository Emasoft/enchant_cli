"Again, it's Wen Ran who married Leng Zhi Fei, not you, Wen Liang. Her happiness and post-marital experiences have nothing to do with you; all you care about is your own interests."

At this thought, Wen Liang's expression turned cold. He hadn't expected his younger sister to still have contact with Su Nan Tian. To him, it was truly a misfortune for the Wen family. How could that scoundrel Su Nan Tian dare to dream of marrying a swan?

"Big brother-in-law? On such an auspicious day, what are you thinking about? Cheer up!"

A well-dressed young man approached. Seeing Wen Liang's gloomy expression, he felt a flicker of anger but kept his composure as he reminded him.

"Oh, it's Zhi Fei. I just remembered some trivial matters. Nothing serious. Today you're the groom, so what are your thoughts?"

Seeing it was his future brother-in-law Leng Zhi Fei, Wen Liang quickly forced a smile, his flattery evident.

"Thoughts? None really. It's the same as before; do what needs to be done. But big brother-in-law, you should also consider your lifelong partner."

Leng Zhi Fei replied without hesitation. As he spoke, he gave a knowing look and raised his eyebrows mischievously.

Wen Liang's smile froze. He had hoped Leng Zhi Fei would at least show some restraint after marriage, but he was still the same. Fortunately, this didn't concern him.

"Oh, my friend called me over there. Big brother-in-law, continue with your duties!"

Leng Zhi Fei didn't wait for Wen Liang's reply. He suddenly saw someone waving at him from the side and hurried over.

After Leng Zhi Fei left, Wen Liang's smile faded. His eyes flashed with a cold glint. It was your wedding, not mine. You're passing all the responsibility to me. Are you waiting for good fortune?

But thinking of Leng's power, Wen Liang had to swallow his anger and continue helping Leng Zhi Fei...

"Fei Ge, I didn't expect you to get married without a word. Your speed is impressive!"

"Indeed, indeed! How's the bride? Only someone as charming as you could be moved by her!"

A group of Leng Zhi Fei's shady friends teased him one after another. Leng Zhi Fei didn't take it seriously but took it as a blessing, raising his glass to toast his friends before quietly scolding them: "Keep your voices down. Many Wen family people have arrived today!"

The group lowered their voices, but their expressions of excitement didn't fade. If anything, they intensified.

Seeing this, Leng Zhi Fei couldn't help but reveal some information. He whispered: "This marriage was arranged by my father. Honestly, I wasn't too happy about it. I don't fear the Wen family or need any alliance!"

"Fei Ge, you're a man of talent. Why tie yourself to one tree? Tell us how Wen's second daughter managed to capture you?"

"Did it happen at first sight?"

"What else could it be? She's just pretty, hehehe..."

Faced with his friends' teasing, Leng Zhi Fei raised an eyebrow and couldn't help but smile: "Wen Ran is different from those common beauties. But trying to capture me is too absurd. When I get bored, I'll leave her behind. I hope she knows how to behave and doesn't cause trouble for the Wen family."

Leng Zhi Fei said the last part with a cold smile. He didn't mind letting Wen Ran know what happened if she provoked him.

As time passed, the host's enthusiastic speech brought the wedding banquet to its most lively moment. The bride and groom exchanged rings, vowing eternal love. Once the rings were exchanged, Leng Zhi Fei and Wen Ran's marriage was officially sealed.

"Oooh... the bride is coming out!"

"The groom looks so handsome. The bride is also beautiful. They are truly a match made in heaven!"

With the guests' cheers, Wen Ran in her wedding dress, accompanied by several attendants, slowly walked out.

Every man who saw Wen Ran at that moment was stunned.

Dressed in a white wedding gown, Wen Ran appeared elegant and graceful. Her eyebrows were lightly drawn, her eyes carefully outlined, a single red lip adding to her allure. Her gaze was bright and captivating, each expression and smile could stir the heart, making one long to protect her tenderly.

The bride Wen Ran didn't seem very happy. She glanced around, not seeing the person she was waiting for, her sorrow almost overwhelming her. Each step felt like a struggle.

Seeing Leng Zhi Fei approaching, Wen Ran forced a smile to appease him.

Leng Zhi Fei had intended to scold Wen Ran harshly, but seeing her beauty stunned him and extinguished his anger.

Faced with a beautiful woman, even the notorious Leng Zhi Fei seemed like a well-behaved little boy, refraining from his usual恶劣 nature.

"Are you unwell?" Leng Zhi Fei feigned concern, reaching out to embrace Wen Ran's waist.

Wen Ran quickly stepped forward and evaded Leng Zhi Fei's embrace, shaking her head: "No... no."

"Good. Everyone is waiting. Let's hurry!"

Seeing Wen Ran's resistance, Leng Zhi Fei felt a bit embarrassed. But today was his big day; under everyone's eyes, he couldn't retaliate. He had to use the Wen family to deal with Wen Ran.

Wen Ran's lashes fluttered, her face showing sorrow. She knew Leng Zhi Fei's nature, but her parents had firmly decided to make her marry him, even threatening her. What could she do?

Without the Wen family's power, Wen Ran was just a weak woman.

Her sorrow transformed into a surging wave that almost overwhelmed her, but to repay her parents' upbringing, she had no choice but to force herself forward.

"Seems our bride is eager. Alright, let's welcome both sets of parents to witness the wedding!"

The host announced joyfully. According to Leng Zhi Fei's intention, the marriage was quickly finalized.

As the host pushed forward, both sets of parents walked onto the stage.

Leng's family: Leng Baoxiong and his wife Tang Li; Wen's family: Wen Hai and his wife Feng Yi.

The four elders arrived at the stage, exchanging greetings before turning their attention to Leng Zhi Fei and Wen Ran.

Leng Baoxiong was satisfied with Leng Zhi Fei's performance today. However, his gaze fell on Wen Ran and a commanding aura immediately emerged.

Chapter 372: Sweep

"Relative? What does that mean?" Leng Baoxiong asked in a deep voice.

Wen Hai also saw his daughter's performance and felt furious, his face slightly embarrassed as he replied: "My daughter is a bit spoiled. She's a little uncomfortable in such a big scene. It'll get used to it."

"I hope so." Leng Baoxiong glanced at Wen Hai and coldly said.

"Let the two newlyweds pay respects to their parents!"

Leng Zhi Fei led Wen Ran to Leng Baoxiong's side. This was to make Wen Ran change her address. Wen Ran opened her mouth but couldn't utter a sound.

"How? Calling me 'father' is so difficult for you?"

Leng Baoxiong was不满, having been met with resistance from the Wen family before. He hadn't expected her to fail at this crucial moment.

"Wen Ran, what are you doing? Call me 'dad' quickly." Leng Zhi Fei felt his father's anger and nervously urged her, his anger already burning fiercely.

"Wen Ran, since you've entered the Leng family, you are now part of it. Don't forget your identity!" Wen Hai also urged her, he couldn't let Leng Baoxiong use this as an excuse to break off the marriage.

A line of tears flowed from her beautiful eyes. Wen Ran looked up again, about to struggle to say the name, when a loud shout interrupted the joyous wedding.

"Wait..."

The elegant music abruptly stopped. The joyful guests turned around in shock.

Standing at the hotel entrance was a man of extraordinary martial prowess. It was him who had interrupted the wedding!

This man was Su Nan Tian.

"He's here, he finally came!"

Wen Ran, who had fallen into endless despair, seemed to see a brilliant light. This light pierced through the darkness, splitting the sky, saving her almost suffocated soul and returning her to the world of light.

"Who is he?" Leng Baoxiong's face changed, asking angrily.

Leng Zhi Fei didn't know who he was. He looked at Wen Hai, but Wen Hai had no idea how to answer and kept making eye signals to Wen Liang.

Wen Liang gritted his teeth, stood up from the onlookers, and angrily said: "People, drive out those irrelevant individuals."

With Wen Liang's command, a group of black-suited bodyguards rushed forward.

These people had undergone military training and were agile. They were the bodyguards protecting the wedding guests from the Leng and Wen families, but they couldn't match Su Nan Tian.

After nodding to Wen Ran, Su Nan Tian rushed forward like a tiger descending from the mountain. He killed anyone who dared to block his path, leaving no bodyguard able to stop him.

Cries of agony echoed around. Each bodyguard was thrown out, either hitting the table or falling on the red carpet. None could withstand Su Nan Tian's first strike.

"Useless, all of you are useless!"

Wen Liang trembled with anger. Thirty bodyguards couldn't stop one Su Nan Tian. Their high salaries were wasted.

Wen Hai was stunned, not expecting Su Nan Tian to be so terrifying. Then another wave of anger surged through him. Even if he was so impolite, daring to challenge the Wen family's authority, it was still self-destruction.

He waved his hand and two imposing middle-aged men stepped forward. These were the experts of the Wen family.

"Go, get rid of him."

After Wen Hai said this, he subtly signaled to have Su Nan Tian expelled and completely crippled.

This wasn't said in front of Leng Baoxiong, still keeping the intention to continue the wedding. After all, it was a joyous day and bloodshed shouldn't happen at the wedding.

As for Su Nan Tian beating people, he had only knocked out the bodyguards. The scene was terrifying but no one was killed, giving Wen Hai a bit of hope.

"Oh? Interesting!"

After Su Nan Tian knocked out the last bodyguard, he looked at the two men Wen Hai had sent.

"Hmph, talking big. Daring to cause trouble at the Leng family's wedding. We two brothers can't allow it."

They both attacked simultaneously, their fists whistling through the air. One on the left and one on the right, using a combined attack!

"Such low-level skills. Dare to come out?" Su Nan Tian coldly glanced at them, releasing a powerful aura.

Boom!

The entire hotel hall felt a chilling chill.

"A strong aura, but alone, it's not enough to make the Leng family bow."

"Ha ha, don't think beating dozens of bodyguards means anything. After all, it's the power that makes people submit."

"If this kid can walk out alive, I'll kneel and call him grandpa right now."

Although the guests were intimidated by Su Nan Tian's power, they didn't speak out loud. But in their hearts, they still didn't take it seriously.

After all, the Leng family almost dominated Hangcheng. Their power wasn't from single combat but from their astonishing wealth.

Although Su Nan Tian had martial arts, the Leng family could also hire experts with money. Who would win was still uncertain.

Su Nan Tian himself didn't have much thoughts, his goal was to defeat all enemies before him and safely return Wen Ran.

Faced with the two experts' combined attack, he remained calm. His fists shot out like two golden dragons crossing a river, directly meeting their punches.

Crack!

A sound of broken bones echoed. Then those seemingly invincible experts rolled on the ground, crying out in pain.

He didn't care about their cries. He kicked repeatedly, and Wen Hai's experts were dragged aside like dead dogs.

After scanning the guests who looked terrified, Su Nan Tian coldly observed and took out a thick stack of photos from his pocket. He casually tossed them, and the photos flew everywhere, precisely landing on every guest's table!

"Hmph, let you see Cold Zhi Fei's true face!"

The guests looked and saw photos of Tihao Group's young master Cold Zhi Fei, who was naked and smiling with a woman.

"Wow, I didn't expect the usually polite Cold Zhi Fei to be such a person!"

"The Leng family is so rich, but this kid's resources are so small. He's even worse than my big one!"

"Each photo seems to have a different woman!"

The guests compared around and found that the same female star appeared in no more than a dozen photos.

Looking at Cold Zhi Fei's furious face, the guests gasped. Oh my god, with such small resources, he dares to flirt with so many women? Did he think himself an emperor?

On stage, Leng Baoxiong also picked up a photo. The female star was someone he even recognized, his personal secretary and one of his lovers.

Feeling his father's furious gaze, Cold Zhi Fei trembled with anger. He grabbed the wedding cake in front of him and smashed it into pieces, yelling wildly at Su Nan Tian: "I won't kill you until I'm done with it!"

"Hmph, dare to do but not dare to take responsibility. See what tricks you have. Go ahead and use them!"

Su Nan Tian coldly looked at Cold Zhi Fei, unmoved by his threat. Since he had come, he was ready for the psychological preparation.

Chapter 373: The So-called Experts

Angry, Leng Baoxiong glared at Cold Zhi Fei and signaled his bodyguards to drag him away, preventing him from making more foolish remarks.

Then he looked at Wen Hai and angrily asked: "Wen Hai? Is this man related to your family's trouble?"

Wen Hai immediately became alert, not even taking time to look at the photos. He quickly explained: "This man has nothing to do with my Wen family. You must be clear!"

"Hmph, I'll deal with you later!"

After saying this, Leng Baoxiong respectfully bowed to an old man in a red Tang suit and said: "Please, Master Lan, help us!"

Old man Lan Rulin smiled slightly and lazily got up. He replied: "Since it's Master Leng's request, the old man naturally agrees."

Leng Baoxiong was happy when Lan Rulin agreed. He had once seen Lan Rulin's power and was amazed by it. Later, he learned that there were a group of hidden experts with extraordinary martial arts in China. Ordinary families couldn't afford them. He had only managed to invite Lan Rulin by using his son's wedding, intending to build a good relationship. Now that he could invite Lan Rulin to help, it was like giving snow in a time of need.

"Unexpectedly, Leng Baoxiong managed to get Lan Rulin's help."

"Another time for Master Lan to show his power. This time, the Leng family has gained a big advantage!"

The guests saw it was Lan Rulin and felt a mix of envy, jealousy, and resentment. If the Leng family could truly recruit Lan Rulin, then this disrupted marriage would become a blessing for the Leng family. It was truly touching.

"Are you here to help the Leng family?" Su Nan Tian ignored the guests' comments and stared at Lan Rulin, asking seriously.

Lan Rulin's usual self-satisfied smile faded. His brows furrowed. How many years had it been since a junior dared to be so disrespectful to him?

But thinking he was here to cause trouble, Lan Rulin's mood slightly improved.

"Young man, I see your age and such cultivation. It's truly difficult. If you can cut off one arm, I'll let you leave!"

Lan Rulin stared at Su Nan Tian with intense eyes. He could see that Su Nan Tian was a master, but his pride made him unwilling to admit it.

At this moment, giving Su Nan Tian a chance not only elevated his own status but also avoided conflict with Su Nan Tian. Lan Rulin felt unexpectedly clever.

"Ah, Master Lan still maintains his dignity and doesn't want to bully the young."

"Master Lan, a senior with such high status, naturally doesn't want to bully the weak." The guests whispered among themselves, feeling regretful that they couldn't see Master Lan's power.

Leng Baoxiong was somewhat dissatisfied with Lan Rulin's self-initiated actions, but to maintain the senior's face, he didn't speak out. He was thinking of completely eliminating Su Nan Tian after he cut off one arm.

Su Nan Tian contemptuously curled his lips and replied: "I think you're old, so it's hard to bully the elderly. Now leave, and I'll let bygones be bygones."

"My god, what's going on? This guy actually refused Master Lan's kindness?"

"Really ungrateful. Thinking he beat a few bodyguards, he doesn't know his place!"

Not only were the guests around stunned, but even Lan Rulin himself was unable to maintain his composure. He angrily shouted and raised both hands, releasing a vast aura that made the tablecloths flutter and made people unable to look directly.

"Junior, don't drink wine but eat punishment. It seems you're used to getting by without any obstacles. Today, the old man will let you know what it means to have heaven beyond heaven and people beyond people!"

After saying this, Lan Rulin suddenly jumped up like a soaring eagle. His eyes shone with brilliance. His hands were strong and powerful, directly striking Su Nan Tian.

"Be careful!"

Wen Ran, seeing Lan Rulin's formidable aura, couldn't help but shout. After the bodyguards surrounded her earlier, she had been terrified. Now that this senior was personally attacking, it became the last straw, making her unable to hold back.

"Is this your mistress? Master Lan, please don't hold back!" Leng Baoxiong glared at Wen Ran and asked Lan Rulin.

Lan Rulin responded with a nod. While in mid-air, his aura became stronger. His hands rushed toward Su Nan Tian's head.

"Oh?"

Su Nan Tian slightly smiled. A cultivation level of just the fifth stage dared to be so bold in front of him. It seemed he needed to show some real strength, or others would look down on him.

"Come down for me!"

The scene was exactly the same as before. Lan Rulin's cultivation level wasn't even up to his, and he was caught by Su Nan Tian. He was then smashed onto the carpet with a scream, losing face completely.

"Kid, you're asking for death!"

Lan Rulin's eyes flickered. He used a bit of skill to break free from Su Nan Tian's grip and reached for Su Nan Tian's heart. This was a full effort.

"Indeed, not simple!"

Su Nan Tian actually felt excited. This Lan Rulin had lower cultivation than him, but his experience in combat was excellent and he calculated the power carefully.

He crossed his hands to block Lan Rulin's attack, then slapped the old man's face. Lan Rulin couldn't react in time and his body spun in the air before falling heavily to the ground, spitting out blood involuntarily.

Seeing this scene, all the guests were silent and speechless.

"Is the title of Hangcheng's top expert today going to be lost?"

Su Nan Tian didn't care about the guests' surprised looks. He directly walked to Wen Ran and took her hand, asking: "Do you want to leave with me?"

Wen Ran's eyes were already filled with tears. Hearing this, she immediately nodded firmly. Su Nan Tian smiled slightly and glanced at Wen Hai who was about to threaten, making Wen Hai feel like struck by lightning, his whole body sweating profusely.

After defeating his biggest enemy with Wen Ran, Su Nan Tian didn't care about the other small figures. He directly took Wen Ran's hand and left the wedding venue.

Chang Bao and others were waiting at the door. When Su Nan Tian and Wen Ran got into the car, the entire Mercedes车队 left safely.

After Wen Ran got into the car, Su Nan Tian immediately put a shirt over her shoulders and said: "Be careful of catching cold!"

Wen Ran stared at Su Nan Tian in shock, then suddenly threw herself into his arms and cried: "I'm glad you came. Otherwise I would have only..."

"Okay, I'll be by your side from now on and protect you. Never abandon you, okay?"

Su Nan Tian looked at the beautiful Wen Ran and was momentarily stunned. He said a heartfelt confession, which was his true feelings at the moment.

"Okay, I believe you."

Wen Ran smiled through her tears and leaned into Su Nan Tian's arms. Her eyes gradually lost focus, as if she was envisioning a happy future.

Su Nan Tian's body slightly stiffened. He slowly extended his hand to touch Wen Ran's shoulder, and Wen Ran's body slightly trembled but didn't clearly refuse. This made him happy. The two of them were tightly together and left.

Chapter 374: Setting a Trap

In the luxurious villa, the usually handsome Cold Zhi Fei now looked like a mad beast, smashing everything in front of him. His desire for destruction was unprecedentedly high. Fragments even splattered onto Wen Liang's face, but Cold Zhi Fei didn't move.

Wen Liang himself was already terrified and couldn't move a muscle.

"Useless, all of you are useless!"

After smashing some things, Cold Zhi Fei suddenly turned to Wen Liang and grabbed his hair with a fierce expression: "Did you know this guy's martial arts were so strong? You planned to make me look foolish, right?"

Wen Liang swallowed his saliva and said: "Your marriage with Wen Ran was arranged by my father and your father. It has nothing to do with me!"

"I'll kill Su Nan Tian myself!"

Cold Zhi Fei violently threw Wen Liang aside and looked at the photo on the coffee table. Su Nan Tian's arrogant expression deeply hurt his eyes. Su Nan Tian's confidence and dominance were ten times better than Cold Zhi Fei.

But the more Su Nan Tian was excellent, the more unfavorable the public opinion became. Various rumors of stealing a wife spread everywhere. Each word reached his ears, making him feel as if his heart was being cut with a knife. He longed to dismember Su Nan Tian.

"Ah..."

Cold Zhi Fei couldn't bear it anymore and tore the photo into pieces.

"You have to find a way to kill this Su Nan Tian. Otherwise, your Wen family will wait..."

Cold Zhi Fei turned around and looked at this former "big brother-in-law," feeling very irritated. He immediately passed his greatest frustration onto him.

Wen Liang was startled and asked: "No, your father didn't let you get involved. For now, no one should interfere with him. Your father will handle the information and public opinion."

"Go away, don't mention your father. You let me lose my wife. Tell me if you can help or not?"

Cold Zhi Fei's eyes were red as he stared at Wen Liang. If Wen Liang didn't agree, he would immediately turn against him.

Wen Liang knew Cold Zhi Fei's temper and had to reluctantly agree.

"Tell me, what good plan do you have?"

"Su Nan Tian has a cousin named Wu You'er!"

"Oh? Are you saying he stole my wife, and I should steal his cousin?"

Cold Zhi Fei's eyes lit up and a smile appeared on his lips.

"No, Wu You'er is protected very carefully by Zhang Bao's people. If we really act, it might bring Su Nan Tian's fierce retaliation. Then not only my Wen family but also your Leng family would be unable to withstand it."

Wen Liang remembered Su Nan Tian's powerful performance at the wedding and felt fear. He hadn't expected this kid to be so strong, even defeating Hangcheng's top expert. It was truly regrettable.

"What use is this talk?"

Cold Zhi Fei wasn't happy. He was only thinking about how to retaliate against Su Nan Tian and didn't care about other things.

Wen Liang suppressed his anger and explained: "We can use the name of reconciliation to design Su Nan Tian to come. We'll deliberately delay time and let Su Nan Tian realize."

"Using the opportunity of Su Nan Tian being isolated from information, we can create a false situation that Wu You'er has been kidnapped. Then we can make Su Nan Tian hesitate, whether to restrict his martial arts or poison him, it's all at our disposal!"

Cold Zhi Fei was delighted and patted Wen Liang's shoulder, looking at him with a new perspective. He said: "I didn't expect my big brother-in-law to have such wisdom. This plan is entrusted to you. After it's successful, I'll humiliate Su Nan Tian in front of him and make him wish to die but can't."

Wen Liang looked at Cold Zhi Fei, who was lost in fantasy, and shook his head slightly. He left the villa to prepare.

Two days later, he felt everything was ready and found Su Nan Tian's phone number on his phone. He called.

"Hello? This is Wen Liang!"

Su Nan Tian was watching TV with Wen Ran. Hearing Wen Liang's voice, they exchanged glances and didn't understand. He asked: "What's up?"

"To let Wen Ran follow you openly, you can come here to solve a problem!"

After saying this, Wen Liang hung up the phone and sent the address to Su Nan Tian. His eyes flashed with a cold glint.

"He's coming!" Cold Zhi Fei said, watching the monitor.

"Is he alone? So confident?" Wen Liang was a bit surprised.

At this moment, it wasn't like the wedding. One was unexpected and the other was well-prepared. This feeling was different.

Although Cold Zhi Fei's villa had many security forces, Su Nan Tian came without hesitation. This made Wen Liang worried. He hesitated and said: "Su Nan Tian's strength is deep and unknown. We should be careful."

Cold Zhi Fei scoffed and waved his hand, saying: "Hmph. No matter how strong he is, it's just one person. I'll use various means to deal with him. Why would I fear one person? If you really don't dare, stay here and wait for my news. I won't mock you."

Wen Liang looked at Cold Zhi Fei's mocking smile. His face felt like it was burning hot. He hesitated, then walked out of the room first toward the security room.

Cold Zhi Fei watched Wen Liang leave and spat in disgust. He adjusted his hair and followed him.

Su Nan Tian stood at the iron gate outside the villa, estimating that the time was about right. He pretended to be impatient and said to the intercom on the wall: "Has Wen Liang come yet? If he doesn't, I'll leave. Next time we meet, don't say I didn't give him a chance!"

The intercom had been silent until now. It finally rang, and the voice of Cold Zhi Fei came out: "Hehe, what wind brought Master Tian here today? You want to give me a chance. I wonder what opportunity you have for me?"

Su Nan Tian narrowed his eyes and said calmly: "Cold Zhi Fei? What's your purpose for calling me here?"

Wang Yangming smiled and replied: "Of course not. I want to talk about a deal with you!"

Su Nan Tian asked interestedly: "A deal? What kind of deal?"

Cold Zhi Fei said slowly: "There's no deep grudge between us. Everything can be resolved through negotiation. I came here to exchange and negotiate conditions."

Su Nan Tian laughed coldly, mocking: "Cold family's eldest son is joking. Your wife was stolen by me. You want to negotiate? Are you setting a trap and waiting for me to fall into it?"

Cold Zhi Fei felt his wound being exposed, and anger surged. However, thinking of Su Nan Tian's terrifying strength, he still suppressed his anger: "What would you believe? The Wen family has agreed to let me end my marriage with Wen Ran!"

Chapter 375: Testing

Su Nan Tian narrowed his eyes and said, "If you're willing to hand over Wen Liang to me, I'll believe in you once."

Wen Liang's face changed. He shouted: "Zhi Fei, don't fall for his trickery!"

Cold Zhi Fei frowned as if thinking about something. Suddenly, he returned to his flirtatious manner and said to Su Nan Tian: "This proposal isn't impossible."

Wen Liang saw Cold Zhi Fei's attitude slightly loosened and panicked: "Zhi Fei, he's just acting. Don't take it seriously!"

Cold Zhi Fei slapped him and said: "You have some color, but you want to open a dye shop? You really think you're something. What do I need your opinion for? One after another, Zhi Fei, it's really disgusting. Take him away and watch carefully!"

The last sentence was to the security staff in the villa.

Wen Liang was slapped to the ground. He listened to Cold Zhi Fei's words and finally shouted: "Cold Zhi Fei, you'll regret it!"

Then he struggled to be carried out of the security room by several people.

Cold Zhi Fei felt a chill down his back from Wen Liang's last words, but he quickly returned to normal and smiled at the monitor of Su Nan Tian: "Wen Liang is ready. I just don't know... hehe..."

Su Nan Tian frowned and pretended to be conflicted, nodding: "Then I'll agree to your reconciliation!"

Cold Zhi Fei couldn't help but laugh loudly twice, politely saying: "Brother, you're too polite. Since you've agreed, my younger brother won't be satisfied. Ha ha, I've seen your sincerity. Let's change the day and meet again. Please come in now and have a detailed talk, okay?"

Su Nan Tian said with a smile: "How? You don't fear that after I get Wen Liang, I'll change my mind?"

Cold Zhi Fei's smile stiffened and said: "It's impossible. Brother, don't play jokes. If you're angry about previous things, I'll apologize and let you be satisfied. Just don't know if you're willing to give me this chance?"

Su Nan Tian sneered: "Hmph, I hope it's not a Hongmen Banquet. I'll come in to get Wen Liang and leave."

Cold Zhi Fei's fake smile was again frozen. He took a deep breath to suppress his temper and smiled with a boldness: "Ha... you're joking. Wait, I'll come to get you myself!"

After this sentence, the intercom was disconnected.

A few subordinates looked at Cold Zhi Fei confusedly. Was this still their small-minded boss? Previously, such a big grudge was so easily resolved?

Cold Zhi Fei glanced at them and guessed their thoughts. He scolded angrily: "Later, be smart. When I throw a cup, you'll attack me. This is such a good opportunity; I must make this bastard die without a burial. Hmph, really giving you face, Su Nan Tian. Today you must pay the price for what you did!"

The subordinates looked like they understood and nodded repeatedly, just hoping it wouldn't be exposed.

Su Nan Tian stood at the door without expression for a while. The iron gate "beeped" and automatically opened. In a moment, several secret eyes scanned him, some with hidden killing intent.

"Hmph, it seems Cold Zhi Fei's ambition is quite big. Unfortunately, his intelligence isn't enough. Ambition alone is wasted!"

Su Nan Tian walked on the pebble path, scanning the hidden sentries and guards. He seemed to be merely admiring the beauty of the villa.

After walking less than ten meters, he saw Cold Zhi Fei with a red face coming towards him. He looked at him twice, surprised that Cold Zhi Fei had acting talent.

Cold Zhi Fei didn't think much. Seeing Su Nan Tian's moment, his eyes were slightly dark, but thinking of capturing this expert and using him to regain his face, he could be better than before. His mood naturally lightened.

He smiled and approached Su Nan Tian, bowing slightly: "Welcome Master Su. Your visit to my humble abode is truly a blessing!"

Su Nan Tian looked at Cold Zhi Fei and saw that this kid was somewhat decent when he was polite. But this fake smile made him dislike it.

In the short half minute of seeing Cold Zhi Fei, Su Nan Tian had hundreds of impulses to punch this fake face. But since he hadn't played with Cold Zhi Fei yet, it was too easy to get rid of him. So he suppressed the impulse.

Su Nan Tian nodded calmly and mocked: "If this is your humble abode, then my house must be a dog窝."

Cold Zhi Fei smiled awkwardly and said: "Ha ha, Master Su is joking. It's because Master Su doesn't care about fame and fortune. Otherwise, with your ability, a mansion or villa would be trivial."

Su Nan Tian continued to tease Cold Zhi Fei with interest: "You're wrong. Mansions and villas, which man doesn't like? I'm just poor by nature. Want to help me?"

Cold Zhi Fei laughed heartily: "If Master Su likes it, you can move here with Wu You'er. I Cold Zhi Fei have nothing else but to spare a few rooms for friends. By the way, I have a top chef here. His skills are truly first-rate. How about Master Su tries it?"

Su Nan Tian saw Cold Zhi Fei dragging his feet and spoke with a hidden needle. He said: "Moving here is okay, but let's talk about the main issue now. The exchange conditions are simple: I reconcile with you, and you give me Wen Liang. We'll be even!"

Cold Zhi Fei replied: "Haha, no rush. Let's go in and talk."

After saying this, he led the way and quickly arrived at the entrance of the villa's living room. A metal detection door stood in front, with several black-suited bodyguards standing around, each holding a rubber bat. Seeing Su Nan Tian approaching, they all stared coldly, spreading an atmosphere of killing.

Su Nan Tian looked at them without saying a word. Not only were they a group of people with toys, but even if everyone had guns, what was the use?

Trash is trash. No matter how they pose, they are still trash. They can't change their nature without experiencing blood and fire!

After being scolded by Su Nan Tian, Cold Zhi Fei walked alone. Seeing his subordinates' good atmosphere, he was happy inside. This intimidation should make Su Nan Tian not look down on him.

But when he accidentally turned around, he saw Su Nan Tian leisurely admiring the garden's landscape. For the well-prepared group, he seemed to ignore them.

Chapter 376: Intimidation

Cold Zhi Fei cursed in his heart. He really could act. When you're caught by my people and beaten, I'll see if you're still so relaxed.

Thinking this, he walked through the metal detection door. His subordinates also went through the metal detection door. The last person was Su Nan Tian!

Su Nan Tian didn't care who went through or not, directly bypassed the metal detection door. He was blocked by a black-suited bodyguard standing aside.
