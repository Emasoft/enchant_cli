“Thus, Xiao Chen kept chattering incessantly, hoping Su Nantian would consider his sister.”

Su Nantian had been lost in thought, pondering his memories and wondering if some event had triggered those fragmented recollections.

It was as though during the fight with the bullies, those scattered pieces had surfaced.

But now, hearing Xiao Chen’s endless chatter in his ear—like five hundred ducks squawking at once—Su Nantian could no longer focus on his thoughts.

He felt a headache, his temples pulsing painfully.

Su Nantian began to regret his decision, wondering if he should have stayed home instead of accompanying Xiao Chen into town.

He deemed it the most foolish choice he had made that day.

But fortunately, when Xiao Chen spoke of these matters, she noticed the clock in the teahouse and realized the time coincided with her sister’s train schedule. She immediately told Su Nantian, “Lige! We must hurry—my sister is about to disembark!”

When Su Nantian heard this, he sighed inwardly, relieved his ears could finally be quiet.

Of course, though he thought this, he gave no sign on his face.

He and Xiao Chen walked to the station to await Chen Xiaoling’s arrival.

While waiting, Su Nantian silently vowed to learn from this mistake and never again let Xiao Chen’s loquacity poison his ears.

On the other hand, Xiao Chen was unaware of Su Nantian’s thoughts. She desperately hoped her sister would appear quickly so Su Nantian could meet her.

Xiao Chen was absolutely confident that her sister’s beauty would move Su Nantian.

“Hmph, why hasn’t she come out yet?”

Xiao Chen stood anxiously, yearning to see her sister’s face.

Unfortunately, all the passengers had already disembarked, and janitors were beginning to clean the train.

Yet Xiao Chen still hadn’t seen her longed-for sister, Chen Xiaoling.

“What’s going on?”

Xiao Chen frowned, puzzled by the situation.

“That was car 20, right? I didn’t misremember the time—this is the same train!”

Xiao Chen furrowed her brow again, thinking through the problem.

“My sister confirmed it by phone before she left—there’s no mistake!”

Xiao Chen muttered to himself, desperately trying to figure out where he had gone wrong.

When Su Nantian heard Xiao Chen’s words, he felt a flicker of doubt. After all, Su Nantian believed Xiao Chen would not make such an error in something so important.

But with the train already being cleaned, Chen Xiaoling’s absence was suspicious.

“Alas! How tragic!”

As Su Nantian and Xiao Chen pondered, they overheard two passengers ahead discussing the matter.

Their tones carried pity and a touch of regret.

“Indeed, that girl is pitiable—just stepped off the train and was dragged in by a group of men. Who knows what will happen next?”

An old woman spoke with concern, clearly distressed.

The man beside her nodded in agreement: “There’s nothing we can do! These are notorious bullies. We common folk dare not provoke them!”

After sighing, the man added: “Blame it on the girl’s bad luck! It’s a shame—beauty isn’t always good. She stumbled into trouble without reason!”

Su Nantian, already suspecting something had happened to Chen Xiaoling, felt a dark thought arise.

He turned to Xiao Chen and said, “Something’s wrong. Xiao Chen, we must go check!”

No matter if the girl taken by the bullies was Xiao Chen’s sister or not, they had to investigate.

Su Nantian would not ignore this matter.

He intended to see which bully in the town had the audacity to abduct a girl openly, as if it were a medieval melodrama.

Moreover, after the incident with the bullies in Xiaoyu Village, Su Nantian had no patience for these idle bullies who only bullied the weak.

He had come out today to teach them a lesson in humanity.

“Right! Lige, we must hurry—what if it’s my sister?”

Xiao Chen, upon hearing the passengers’ conversation, broke out in a cold sweat. Regardless of whether it was his sister or not, he was now deeply worried.

He thought they needed to confirm quickly—no matter who it was, he couldn’t stand by and watch an innocent girl be taken!

“That’s right, Lige, we must move fast—else it’ll get worse!”

Thinking this, Xiao Chen urged Su Nantian again.

He believed that with Su Nantian’s strength, they had no reason to fear these bullies.

Chapter 800: Rescue

Su Nantian saw Xiao Chen’s agreement and nodded. The two hurried toward the direction the women had taken.

It was a narrow alley leading to the station’s back entrance.

Few people passed through it normally, and when Su Nantian and Xiao Chen entered, the place was empty and silent. If someone had ill intentions here, their cries would go unheard.

Xiao Chen anxiously scanned the area, searching for his sister’s figure. After circling several times, he found no one.

“Did they not come here?”

Xiao Chen rubbed the back of his head, puzzled.

But they had clearly heard the women’s discussion—this was the direction! Had she already been taken?

At this moment, Su Nantian felt deep confusion. He wondered what had happened and considered if they might have taken the wrong path, preparing to search elsewhere.

Suddenly, a sharp scream echoed from the alley’s depths.

From the pitch of the voice, it was undoubtedly a girl.

They had not taken the wrong path!

Su Nantian exchanged a determined glance with Xiao Chen, both seeing resolve in each other’s eyes.

They followed the alley deeper, hearing clearer sounds—screams and pleas from the girl.

Xiao Chen had been grim-faced, but upon hearing his sister’s cries, his eyes widened like those of a bull.

Xiao Chen shouted loudly: “That’s my sister! It’s my sister!”

After shouting, he rushed in without looking back at Su Nantian.

At this moment, his only thought was to save his sister and punish these villains.

“Sister!”

Xiao Chen rushed in, shouting again. Indeed, the girl being held was Chen Xiaoling—his longed-for sister.

Chen Xiaoling stood surrounded by bullies at the alley’s end, a dead-end.

Her face was pale and pitiful, but her clothes were intact—no signs of damage. She had just been taken.

Seeing this, Xiao Chen sighed in relief. Thank goodness he hadn’t arrived too late; otherwise, he would never forgive himself for life.

“Let go of my sister!”

Xiao Chen rushed forward and shouted, stopping the bullies’ actions.

The bullies had been teasing Chen Xiaoling when they heard the voice behind them and turned instinctively. Seeing Xiao Chen, they sneered at him dismissively, ignoring his presence entirely.

“Brother!”

Chen Xiaoling saw Xiao Chen and felt like a savior, shouting excitedly for him to save her.

At this moment, the bullies stepped aside, and a man slowly emerged from the middle.

Seeing him, Xiao Chen was stunned—unbelievable! This world was so small that they met again!

This man was Ahao, the one Su Nantian had crippled a few days ago.

Xiao Chen was astonished to see Ahao but, upon considering their old grudges, felt even more hatred toward him.

“Again you?”

Ahao’s mood was no better than Xiao Chen’s; he recognized him immediately.

Ahao felt annoyed and somewhat cursed.

He sneered and said, “You again?” before growling at Xiao Chen: “Why are you people from Xiaoyu Village always haunting me? I didn’t go to your village—don’t interfere!”

Ahao spoke coldly, treating Xiao Chen as a foolish hero. He ordered him to leave immediately.

Meanwhile, Ahao thought about how his life had been ruined since Su Nantian crippled his hand. They had spent a fortune on foreign medical checks, and doctors had told him bluntly that his hand could never recover.

Thinking of this, Ahao’s hatred for Su Nantian deepened. He had stayed home these days in frustration, avoiding everywhere and fearing his hand would be mocked by old friends.

But after so many days of frustration at home, Ahao had finally stepped out—unluckily, his first outing was to flirt with a girl and met the “plague” of Xiaoyu Village again!

At first, Ahao had wanted to teach Xiao Chen a lesson but thought of Su Nantian’s power and his threat. His injured hand still left aftereffects, and thinking of Su Nantian made it ache again.

Ahao decided not to get involved with people from Xiaoyu Village anymore.

“Before I get angry, leave now! This has nothing to do with you!”

Ahao frowned and scolded him, ordering Xiao Chen to leave.

“How isn’t it my business? She’s my sister! I can’t abandon her!”

Xiao Chen clenched his fists and shouted back at Ahao: “Do you think everyone’s as heartless as you?”

Xiao Chen cursed Ahao, and their long-standing grudges were now fully exposed.

“Hey, what are you talking about? Can you even speak to Hao Ge like that?”

The two henchmen beside Ahao interrupted Xiao Chen’s words, then turned to Ahao: “Hao Ge, should we give this annoying guy a lesson?”

At this point, the henchmen started stretching their limbs, preparing to teach Xiao Chen a lesson and make him respectful of Ahao.

Ahao had no particular fondness for people from Xiaoyu Village, and now seeing Xiao Chen suddenly appear to ruin his fun, he was angry.

Ahao first glanced behind Xiao Chen, seeing no sign of Su Nantian, then looked at his drooping left hand. Suddenly, he had a twisted idea.

After all, Su Nantian wasn’t here—why should he be restricted by these people from Xiaoyu Village?

He could kill Xiao Chen and end it all, leaving no evidence. Even if Su Nantian came later, there would be no proof to punish him.

After thinking this through, Ahao didn’t hold back and immediately ordered his henchmen:

“Go! Hit him hard and subdue him! Also, break his hands!”

Chapter 801: Mice Encounter a Cat

Ahao narrowed his eyes, issuing cruel and merciless orders.

Why should his hand not recover while this annoying person remained whole?

Ahao was now completely unhinged, his mind twisted and deeply unbalanced.

“Go! Hit him hard and subdue him! Also, break his hands! I’ll reward you heavily!”

Ahao was now completely deranged. He shouted again, ordering the henchmen to attack and strike mercilessly.

Moreover, Ahao was now completely mad—he wanted to retaliate against Xiao Chen and let the people of Xiaoyu Village feel the pain he had endured.

The henchmen were hired by Ahao with heavy money to pass the time. Upon hearing Ahao’s words, they immediately agreed; after all, they were hired to fight, and they would get paid.

It was Xiao Chen who would be crippled—nothing to do with them!

“You dare!”

Xiao Chen widened his eyes, clenching his fists. He hadn’t expected Ahao to say such things.

He had thought that after Su Nantian drove them away, Ahao and his group hadn’t appeared because they had a change of heart or were afraid of Su Nantian.

But he hadn’t expected their true nature to remain as unyielding as a stone, never changing.

Now, they still wanted to harm him!

People like this would never repent or reflect on their actions.

“Dare?”

Ahao heard Xiao Chen’s words and thought it was a joke. The henchmen also echoed Ahao’s laughter, mocking Xiao Chen.

Ahao repeated the question and sneered: “You’ll know if I dare when I hit you!”

After saying this, Ahao signaled the two henchmen to approach and teach Xiao Chen a lesson.

Let him experience the pain he was currently feeling!

Chen Xiaoling, hearing these brutal people wanted to harm her brother, immediately panicked: “Don’t! Don’t hurt my brother!”

But at this moment, no one cared about Chen Xiaoling’s words or listened to her commands.

The two henchmen pulled out wooden sticks from somewhere, sneering and approaching Xiao Chen arrogantly.

“Hey, Lige! Come out quickly!”

Xiao Chen saw them getting closer and realized he couldn’t withstand their attack. He shouted urgently for Su Nantian to come out.

When they had first entered the alley, Su Nantian had signaled Xiao Chen to go in first and stayed at the turn to ambush.

Xiao Chen didn’t know why Su Nantian made this decision, but he followed it.

Now, seeing the bullies attack him, Xiao Chen couldn’t stay calm and shouted for Su Nantian’s help.

When Ahao heard Xiao Chen call out the name he hated and was familiar with, his expression changed immediately.

It was a twisted face—his features almost deformed from hatred. He seemed to hate Su Nantian but was also genuinely afraid, a contradiction.

Ahao tried to stay calm and thought Xiao Chen was just mocking him, trying to scare him with Su Nantian’s name. Thus, his attitude was even more arrogant and looked down on Xiao Chen.

“Hmph! You still call him Lige? Today even if the heavens’ god came, you wouldn’t escape!”

Ahao sneered and threatened.

“Brother! Run quickly! Why are you still standing there?”

Chen Xiaoling didn’t know about Su Nantian’s existence, so she was confused. But seeing her brother still standing there, she panicked and urged him to leave: “Brother! Run first! Don’t worry about me!”

Su Nantian had initially wanted to see if he could hear any secrets or clues by staying hidden. Thus, he remained silent.

Now hearing Xiao Chen’s cry for help and seeing Ahao still as arrogant, Su Nantian couldn’t stay indifferent.

He took a step forward slowly. When he appeared before Xiao Chen, Ahao’s face turned pale and he took several steps back until his body pressed against the wall with no escape. Ahao stood trembling.

Whether it was a psychological effect, Ahao felt his hand start to ache again after seeing Su Nantian.

Although he had taken medicine and treatment, his hand was now functional but still painful. Seeing Su Nantian here made Ahao feel his hand ache again.

This pain felt like it came from all directions, penetrating his skin and surrounding him completely, leaving no escape.

“It’s really you!”

Ahao trembled as he spoke these four words. He hadn’t expected Xiao Chen to be telling the truth—Su Nantian was indeed with them!

Ahao saw Su Nantian and remembered his vow to punish him the next time he met. But now, seeing Su Nantian up close, not only did Ahao have no chance to retaliate, but his mind kept replaying the moment Su Nantian had hurt him.

His whole body started trembling, a natural psychological reaction to facing the one who had harmed him.

Xiao Chen saw Ahao’s attitude and was happy, lifting his chin to look at Ahao arrogantly. He no longer feared he would be bullied by him.

Xiao Chen clapped his hands and said: “Hehe, in front of a tiger, you’re just a little cat!”

Ahao glared at Xiao Chen for mocking him and taking advantage of the situation. But when he turned back, he saw Su Nantian staring at him.

Ahao took a deep breath and dared not move, fearing Su Nantian would notice him again. He immediately became quiet and stayed in the corner, not daring to look at Su Nantian even once.

He also became obedient and lowered his eyes, not daring to meet Su Nantian’s gaze.

Chapter 802: Teaching a Lesson

The two henchmen had intended to attack Xiao Chen but stopped when they saw Ahao seemed to fear them.

Normally, these people would do their job for money, but now seeing even Ahao, who was strong, didn’t dare to oppose Su Nantian, they realized his strength and dared not act rashly. They were afraid of being noticed.

“How?”

Su Nantian raised an eyebrow and smiled lightly, looking at Ahao, who was stunned.

He thought of Ahao’s arrogant words earlier and smiled again, as if hearing something amusing.

Then Su Nantian continued, looking down at Ahao with mockery: “Tell me, weren’t you saying you wanted to kill us? Why are you not acting now?”

Su Nantian had heard Ahao’s words clearly from the shadows. He hadn’t just wanted to kill them but also planned to destroy evidence and leave no proof.

This sinister plan made Su Nantian even more determined not to let Ahao off the hook.

Ahao was already afraid of Su Nantian, especially after seeing him, his arm started to ache again. Ahao was even more wary of him now.

Moreover, Ahao was regretful in his heart, thinking he hadn’t checked the calendar before leaving. He had met Su Nantian, a plague, even in town.

But when he heard Su Nantian mocking him, Ahao felt extremely embarrassed, especially with the henchmen he had brought along. He felt even more ashamed.

But to oppose Su Nantian, he didn’t have the courage or ability. At this moment, Ahao could only swallow his anger and dare not say anything to Su Nantian.

Xiao Chen saw Ahao’s pitiful state and mocked him openly, thinking he was like a frightened quail.

He saw Ahao now trembling and not daring to speak, completely different from his attitude toward himself earlier. It was another face entirely!

Thinking of Ahao’s double standards, Xiao Chen felt even more angry.

Xiao Chen directly said to Ahao: “What? You were boasting about breaking me earlier, but now that Lige is here, you dare not touch me?”

At this point, Xiao Chen glared at Ahao angrily, feeling he had no respect for him. Especially thinking of Ahao’s earlier boasts to beat him up, Xiao Chen was even angrier.

Not to mention Ahao had wanted to bully Chen Xiaoling. If they hadn’t arrived in time, would Chen Xiaoling be in danger?

Thinking of this, Xiao Chen could never forgive Ahao.

When hearing Xiao Chen’s words, Ahao was angry: “You!”

But after saying this word, he saw Su Nantian and his eyes turned mysterious. Ahao immediately stopped talking.

The henchmen beside Ahao looked at each other, unsure why Ahao had become so timid.

But seeing Ahao’s fear of Su Nantian and his carefulness, they as subordinates dared not challenge Su Nantian.

Thus, the henchmen remained silent and stood beside Ahao without moving forward.

“Remember when I warned you that if you touched people from Xiaoyu Village, I would kill you? Do you remember this?”

Su Nantian took a step forward and spoke coldly, his aura instantly changing. No one dared to look at him directly, fearing they would be scared into weakness.

Ahao saw Su Nantian’s movement and took a step back again. Even though he was pressed against the wall, at the end of the alley, he still instinctively wanted to move away from Su Nantian.

And when hearing Su Nantian say this, Ahao was terrified. Especially thinking of Su Nantian’s strength and how he had crippled his hand without hesitation before, Ahao was even more worried.

He didn’t dare say anything to Su Nantian or look at him.

Ahao instinctively pulled his intact arm back, fearing Su Nantian would cripple his other hand this time. That would make him a one-armed man, unable to move forward.

Now that he had lost one hand and was already inconvenient, Ahao didn’t want to become like that.

Ahao thought of this and his face became even more terrified, his body trembling uncontrollably. His eyes never left Su Nantian, fearing he would be punished at this moment.

“I don’t know she was from Xiaoyu Village. This isn’t my fault!”

Ahao tried to justify himself, hoping Su Nantian would show mercy and let him go.

“You’re lying!”

Chen Xiaoling had now run to Xiao Chen’s side. When she heard Ahao say this, she immediately interrupted him:

“When your brother said I was his sister, you clearly knew we were from Xiaoyu Village. Yet you still did this—clearly, you didn’t take Lige’s words seriously!”

Chen Xiaoling was indeed smart. Though she still didn’t understand the situation, and didn’t know why Ahao feared Su Nantian so much.

But seeing Ahao’s terrified expression, she immediately used Su Nantian’s authority to threaten and scare Ahao.

Indeed, after hearing Chen Xiaoling’s words, Ahao was stunned and had no reply. His face turned even darker than soot.

Chen Xiaoling then looked at Su Nantian and continued: “Lige, this villain wanted to cripple my brother’s hands!”

Chen Xiaoling didn’t know who Su Nantian was, but seeing her brother relied on him so much and that Su Nantian looked like he would protect them, she immediately followed her brother’s lead to call him “Lige.”

Moreover, Chen Xiaoling was very clever and didn’t exaggerate. She just stated the facts without adding anything, unlike other naive girls who would beg for mercy for enemies at this moment.

Su Nantian was quite satisfied with this unknown Chen Xiaoling.

“Don’t worry, as long as I’m here, he won’t be arrogant.”

When Su Nantian heard Chen Xiaoling’s address, he raised an eyebrow and looked at her with higher regard.

He suddenly felt that Xiao Chen’s words weren’t necessarily exaggerated.

Chapter 803: Fox Borrowing the Tiger's Might

This Chen Xiaoling was indeed quite smart.

At least her emotional intelligence was high; she remained calm in this situation instead of trembling like a typical girl.

Moreover, she cleverly knew to rely on Su Nantian and sought his help.

Since Chen Xiaoling was also a villager from Xiaoyu Village and Xiao Chen’s sister, Su Nantian naturally had to protect them.

“What else do you have to deny?”

Su Nantian raised an eyebrow and refocused on Ahao.

When Ahao heard Su Nantian mention his name, he shivered again, his face pale without a trace of color.

Ahao thought about how Su Nantian had crippled his hand without hesitation before, giving him no chance to hesitate. Now, Su Nantian saying he would kill him was definitely not a lie.

After thinking of this, Ahao became even more terrified and immediately begged Su Nantian for mercy: “I was wrong! I really was wrong! It was my madness. I shouldn’t have attacked people from Xiaoyu Village again, and I’ll never do it again!”

Ahao told himself in his heart that from now on, whenever he met people from Xiaoyu Village, he would take a detour and never oppose them again.

“Let me go! I’ll never do it again!”

Ahao continued to beg, his attitude completely opposite to the arrogance he had shown earlier. He no longer acted as he did when he first came to flirt with Chen Xiaoling.

He truly felt his luck was bad—had he known that flirting with a pretty girl would mean being from Xiaoyu Village, he wouldn’t have done such a foolish thing.

But now it was too late; there was no way to deny it.

So Ahao admitted his mistake and immediately apologized to Su Nantian, begging him to show mercy this time.

The henchmen saw Ahao’s pitiful state and all took a deep breath. If it weren’t for Ahao’s unchanged face, they truly couldn’t connect him with the arrogant image he had shown earlier.

They were shocked by Ahao’s complete reversal and didn’t know what was happening to him.

But seeing Ahao start to beg, they realized these people were not someone they could offend. They also wisely joined Ahao in begging.

In an instant, the alley was filled with their overlapping pleas.

This scene was completely opposite to how they had threatened Chen Xiaoling earlier.

“I spit on you! You think it’s easy? If Lige hadn’t happened to be here, you wouldn’t know how arrogant you are!”

Xiao Chen angrily interrupted Ahao’s begging at this moment, not falling for Ahao’s act.

Xiao Chen glared at Ahao with anger and hatred, never forgetting Ahao’s past misdeeds.

Ahao had previously hit his head; today he wanted to kill him and harm his sister.

Such arrogant people, how could Xiao Chen let them go?

Moreover, these bullies were universally despised; no one would sympathize with them.

Xiao Chen didn’t have the heart of a saint to forgive such despicable people.

Furthermore, Xiao Chen knew their nature well and understood they would definitely kill them if given the chance.

Now, it was only because Su Nantian was here that Ahao had calculated the pros and cons and realized he couldn’t fight Su Nantian, so he changed his mind to beg.

After connecting all these points, Xiao Chen could not sympathize with people like Ahao.

“You!”

Ahao had thought his begging would make Su Nantian let him go, but Xiao Chen was still pouring cold water on his act.

He was extremely angry and thought of how he had always been superior, but now he had been defeated by the same person multiple times. This was already embarrassing enough; now being targeted by Xiao Chen made him even angrier.

Ahao almost couldn’t hold back and wanted to curse Xiao Chen.

Indeed, people like them were the typical bullies who only feared the strong and took advantage of the weak.

But when Ahao said this word, he immediately received a warning glance from Su Nantian.

Ahao didn’t dare to continue cursing Xiao Chen, and even took a deep breath.

Ahao immediately stopped and no longer glared at Xiao Chen.

Su Nantian saw Ahao’s cooperation and was satisfied, slightly calming his expression: “Tell me, after your apology, what else do you want to do?”

Su Nantian spoke coldly at this moment with a hint of mockery.

When Ahao looked surprised, Su Nantian sneered again, extremely contemptuous.

“Do you think this is so easy to move on? You just said a few words of apology and I’ll forgive you and let you go? That’s too cheap for you!”

Su Nantian didn’t know what Ahao was thinking, but he spoke lightly with a mocking tone. He found Ahao’s face too thick.

Su Nantian wasn’t doing charity now.

Moreover, people like Ahao who only bullied the weak and feared the strong—why should Su Nantian be polite to them?

“No, no, it’s not like that.”

Ahao heard Su Nantian say this and felt as if he had been stepped on, immediately regaining his senses. He quickly explained: “We know the rules!”

After saying this, Ahao immediately looked at Su Nantian and earnestly promised: “Lige, whatever you want, just tell me. If it’s something I can do, I’ll agree!”

After saying this, Ahao continued to beg Su Nantian: “Just let me go and don’t hurt me anymore!”

At this moment, Ahao was terrified. He was afraid Su Nantian would attack his other arm.

So he was extremely anxious and couldn’t relax.

Su Nantian looked at Ahao and knew what he was worried about.

Su Nantian’s lips curled again, forming a mocking curve. His eyes also carried disdain and contempt: “Now you’re afraid? Then why weren’t you like this when I wasn’t here?”

Su Nantian said this and sneered again: “Xiaoling asked you to let her go, but did you? How could your words be the imperial decree that I must obey?”

Su Nantian said this and sneered again, finding Ahao somewhat ridiculous.

Chapter 804: Partial Reversal

Now you’re afraid of me, but why didn’t you act like this before?

You previously didn’t even consider the villagers of Xiaoyu who were bullied by you. What had they done to deserve your anger? This was too ridiculous, and they were completely innocent.

Su Nantian had dealt with Ahao and his group several times, so he clearly knew what kind of people they were—bullies who only feared the strong and took advantage of the weak.

If Su Nantian hadn’t been here today, he believed Ahao would not have let Chen Xiaoling go. Nor would they have left Xiao Chen and his group unharmed.

These people’s ambitions were obvious, and they didn’t deserve anyone's sympathy.

“Do you really think I would let you go so easily?”

Su Nantian continued speaking at this moment, sneering again and looking at Ahao with clear mockery. It seemed he also took pleasure in watching the situation unfold.

Ahao heard Su Nantian’s words and shook his head immediately, almost like a bobbing top.

Ahao was now full of regret and didn’t know how to deal with Su Nantian.

Especially when he saw Su Nantian’s serious expression, and remembered that Su Nantian had always acted immediately without hesitation.

Su Nantian’s words were clear: he would not let Ahao off the hook easily.
