Chapter 655: Weakness

Su Nantian's words ignited a fierce fire within Nangong Lin’s heart. Though he had never intended to surrender the Nangong family, his health issues had compelled him to retreat into the shadows. Thus, he had gradually entrusted the family’s most critical matters to Nangong Yuyan and Nangong Ping.

But now, Su Nantian’s words made him realize he was not yet at his end. He must let them know that the lion had not slept, and the Nangong family still belonged to him. Not only did he need to purge and intimidate within the household, but he must also demonstrate the family’s authority and dignity externally.

“You said earlier that you would have me step in at the final crucial moment. Then, can I trust you to assist Nangong Ping with the preceding matters?”

As Su Nantian believed his speech had stirred Nangong Lin’s resolve, he was taken aback when Nangong Lin suddenly spoke with an even more authoritative tone. It seemed his words had awakened the latent power within Nangong Lin.

Su Nantian inwardly cursed, realizing his intention had been to urge Nangong Lin to act more aggressively against the Wu family. Instead, Nangong Lin had redirected his newfound vigor toward himself immediately.

Su Nantian smiled and adopted a solemn demeanor, saying, “Master, rest assured. I will do my utmost to assist the young master in ensuring he does not disappoint your expectations during this wetland bidding project. I will also prevent the Wu family from taking advantage of us.”

What else could he say? Moreover, this was his chance to approach the Wu family. Naturally, he needed to reassure Nangong Lin so that he could stabilize his contact with Wu Chuan.

“Then, I entrust this matter to you. However, regarding the Wu family’s attempts to court you, what are your plans?” Nangong Lin spoke as if the matter was already in Su Nantian’s hands, but his mind still harbored doubts. He needed to understand Su Nantian’s intentions.

Su Nantian knew Nangong Lin still doubted him. Naturally, he was suspicious of Su Nantian’s dealings with the Wu family. If Su Nantian pretended to be a double agent but secretly colluded with the Wu family, betraying the Nangong family at the critical moment, it would be a significant loss.

Thus, Nangong Lin needed to understand Su Nantian’s plan before he could fully trust him. Without knowing the details, how could he control Su Nantian?

“Currently, the Wu family has just approached me and proposed conditions. I am now feigning reluctance while secretly preparing to negotiate more favorable terms. We will engage in a battle of wits, but our primary goal remains securing this project at the bidding. As for what follows, I will think of solutions as we go. However, the exact steps are still unclear because the Wu family’s reaction is crucial. I will rehearse all possibilities, and if their response proves unfavorable, everything must be discarded and redone.”

After pondering, Su Nantian said this. At present, even if he provided a complete plan to Nangong Lin, it would be of little use. The most critical factor was the Wu family’s response. Even if he had planned every step, if their reaction deviated from his expectations, all plans would be in vain.

Nangong Lin nodded after hearing Su Nantian’s words, acknowledging the stakes involved.

“Then proceed as you said. Though I will not interfere with the initial matters, you must report to me regularly. I must remain informed of your movements at all times; otherwise, how can I command the crowd at the final moment?”

After saying this, Nangong Lin smiled. That expression sent a shiver through Su Nantian—apparently, he had once again fallen into Nangong Lin’s trap.

But for Su Nantian, this was not a major issue. Even if Nangong Lin sought to control him in this matter, it posed no harm to his plans. His true objective was not the Nangong family’s assets but rather connecting with Wu Chuan and meeting Wu You’er.

Thus, Nangong Lin’s oversight of this matter was irrelevant to Su Nantian.

Su Nantian immediately nodded and replied, “No problem, Master. I will keep you informed of the progress throughout. Moreover, this is a contest against Wu Chuan. I believe even with Nangong Ping’s help, we may not be able to match him. At that time, I will need your guidance.”

Su Nantian’s words struck a chord with Nangong Lin. Though he had delegated the family’s affairs to Nangong Yuyan and Nangong Ping, his power had not been relinquished.

Everything remained under his control. By subtly showing weakness, he made Nangong Lin believe he was still within his grasp, thereby earning a measure of trust. After all, one could not fully entrust something they couldn’t control.

After hearing Su Nantian’s words, Nangong Lin felt somewhat reassured and waved his hand, saying, “Then proceed as planned. Remember what I said. Alright, you may leave.”

After speaking, Nangong Lin was assisted by his steward as he ascended to the second floor. Though outwardly nothing seemed amiss, Su Nantian’s keen eyes could discern that Nangong Lin’s physical condition was far worse than it appeared.

After all, Su Nantian himself had deep knowledge of such matters. From Nangong Lin’s gait and breath, he could determine that his condition was far more deteriorated than it seemed.

When Su Nantian saw Nangong Lin ascend the stairs, he shook his head and muttered, “I did not expect the crisis within the Nangong family to be this deep. Who could have imagined that the head of the Nangong family was already so weak? It seems the Nangong family will soon face some unprecedented conflicts.”

Chapter 656: Proceed as Planned

“Su Nantian? What are you doing here?”

As Su Nantian was lost in thought, someone lightly patted his shoulder. He nearly jumped, turning around to find Nangong Yuyan standing behind him.

Su Nantian quickly adjusted his expression, concealing any signs of alarm.

“Miss Yuyan, you said you were going to sleep. Why are you still lingering here?”

Su Nantian spoke with his usual demeanor, but inwardly he was startled. He had been so engrossed in thought that he hadn’t noticed someone approaching from behind.

If it had been an intruder instead of Nangong Yuyan, he might have suffered a severe injury. The thought made his mood even more solemn.

He had been careless.

It seemed he had grown too comfortable in this place, allowing his subordinates to become complacent. Thinking of this, Su Nantian quickly regained his usual composure.

“You have the audacity to question me? You know it’s so late, yet you’re still lingering near your father’s residence?”

Nangong Yuyan arched her eyebrows, and as she spoke, an unspoken thought crossed her mind. Her gaze turned sharp: “You don’t happen to be hiding something from me, do you?”

This statement made Su Nantian’s heart skip a beat. He had long known that Nangong Yuyan was not easily deceived. She had immediately grasped the core of the issue and questioned him directly.

If she had arrived earlier, she might have discovered the problem.

After speaking, Nangong Yuyan furrowed her brows and stared at Su Nantian with suspicion, attempting to find cracks in his expression.

“Miss Yuyan speaks strangely. The Master merely asked me to speak with him as usual.”

Su Nantian knew the most successful lie was half-truth. By mixing truth with falsehood, one could gain more credibility.

He paused and continued smiling: “Miss Yuyan is so intelligent; how could my affairs escape your sharp eyes?”

“Hmph, that’s true!”

Nangong Yuyan nodded in agreement after hearing Su Nantian’s words, her expression one of feigned superiority.

If there was a flaw in Nangong Yuyan, it was her excessive pride and self-confidence.

But Su Nantian had mastered her character, knowing exactly how to speak with her to dispel her suspicions.

“The Master has been deeply concerned about Miss Yuyan and the young master, still harboring doubts about me. He has been probing my background and intentions constantly, fearing I might not fully assist you.”

Su Nantian said this, then gazed at Nangong Yuyan with an open and honest expression. He was not concerned about her detecting any deceit in his eyes.

Upon hearing Su Nantian’s words, Nangong Yuyan’s sharp gaze softened slightly. Her suspicion of him gradually diminished. She muttered half-accusatory, half-sincere words: “That’s because you deserve it. My father didn’t misjudge you.”

Su Nantian had infiltrated the Nangong family with ulterior motives. He had concealed his true intentions well, and it was only by chance that she had discovered him meeting Wu You’er. Otherwise, he might never have revealed his purpose of rescuing Wu You’er and her parents.

Thinking of this, Nangong Yuyan glared at Su Nantian with resentment. She couldn’t help but wonder, why? Why was he not truly a bodyguard? Why couldn’t he be genuinely devoted to her?

Otherwise, with Su Nantian’s talent and ability, the Nangong family would surely have ascended to greater heights. This thought made her even more resentful.

“You’re right, Miss Yuyan. It is indeed my fault.”

Seeing Nangong Yuyan lost in thought, Su Nantian spoke. Upon hearing this, she snapped out of her thoughts and glared at him again before muttering a sentence and walking away: “Hmph! It’s all your fault!”

What annoyed her most was that she realized her emotions and moods were being manipulated by Su Nantian’s actions. Even though Nangong Yuyan had always focused on the family’s welfare and had no interest in matters of the heart, she knew her current situation was particularly dangerous.

“Wait! Why am I angry? Why does he affect my mood?”

Nangong Yuyan suddenly stopped, biting her lip. She then cast a resentful glance at Su Nantian’s back before walking away with larger steps.

She was the shining pearl of the Nangong family. Su Nantian’s decision not to stay was his lack of vision and fortune, not hers. There was no need for her to question herself!

With this thought, Nangong Yuyan lifted her chin with even more arrogance and left.

“Usually, she seems mature, but when it comes to critical moments, she still throws a fit.”

Su Nantian was bewildered. He didn’t understand why Nangong Yuyan had suddenly thrown a fit. After all, his methods were effective, and he was always composed in dealing with people. Why did she become a spoiled brat every time they met?

Su Nantian couldn’t help but suspect whether Nangong Yuyan had been too repressed lately. Perhaps it was because she had finally encountered someone who saw her true face, so every time they met, she vented all her frustration on him.

Thinking of this, Su Nantian wasn’t sure whether to say that some people are happy while others are sad or to say that the power of a strong background brings not only high status but also more responsibilities and pressures.

Su Nantian shook his head forcefully, pushing the thought aside. He reminded himself that now he had no time or energy to ponder such unnecessary and useless questions. There were still many things left for him to do.

Although he had infiltrated the Nangong family in less time than others, it had taken him several months to gradually gain their trust.

Especially now that Su Nantian had unexpectedly discovered Nangong Lin’s deteriorating health and the family’s declining trend, he was even more determined to complete his mission swiftly and leave the Nangong family.

Chapter 657: Handling It

“Things can’t be delayed any longer.”

After thinking about these matters, Su Nantian’s expression grew more solemn. His eyes deepened like a captivating pool of water, drawing anyone who gazed into it in completely.

He had to complete the task assigned to him as soon as possible and accelerate his departure; otherwise, lingering here would only complicate matters further. His own situation would also become more dangerous.

Thinking of this, Su Nantian’s expression grew even graver.

Moreover, for some reason, Su Nantian had a strong sense that this matter would not be ordinary. It would likely stir up many unpredictable and immeasurable waves.

But Su Nantian thought again, it was indeed so. After all, this matter concerned the wetland development bidding and a major reshuffle of the inland port’s status.

This matter would not be ordinary at all; instead, the waves would only grow stronger.

Especially with the Nangong family’s external threats unresolved and internal troubles arising, this storm would surely bring countless dangers and difficulties.

This time, it was a test of who could keep their ship steady and fast while others might be capsized by storms.

But Su Nantian was not a person prone to unnecessary worries. He simply considered all possible scenarios, listed them, and speculated on the most plausible ones.

He was absolutely not overthinking or scaring himself unnecessarily.

These signs indicated that he had only one path to take: complete the mission as soon as possible and leave the Nangong family, this place of conflict.

This matter involved competition among various families. If one was careless, they might be dragged into the mud, and this was a mud pit unrelated to him. Su Nantian had no need to stay here with them.

His current task was to find an opportunity to take Wu You’er and her parents away, stir up more chaos in this pond, and then smoothly withdraw when others were busy. That was what he should do most.

Thinking of this, Su Nantian gradually suppressed all his expressions.

He slowly looked up at the sky and noticed that the moon was bright with few stars, the sky clean and pure without a single excess cloud.

Su Nantian knew that according to this weather, tomorrow would definitely be a fine day—clear skies with no clouds.

Su Nantian收回 his gaze, thinking that he hoped tomorrow’s events would be as smooth as the weather. He didn’t want any more waves.

The wetland bidding was a tempting prize; anyone with status and prestige in the inland port would be interested.

However, due to Wu family and Nangong family’s dominance, others’ reactions were not so obvious. In reality, anyone with ability was secretly scheming to take a share of the pie.

Their thoughts were simple: since they couldn’t outdo Wu and Nangong families, they could at least take a small portion.

Moreover, for such a large plan as the wetland bidding, even a little taste of the broth was a great blessing and favor for them.

Thus, these people focused their efforts on courting the Nangong family, Wu family, and other powerful families capable of bidding. Some were more cautious and currently in an observational stance, waiting for signs before placing their bets.

Indeed!

Even Nangong Fei, who had always hidden his true face with the guise of a failure, couldn’t resist being lured.

“Uncle!”

Nangong Fei saw Nangong Ping and Su Nantian coming out, his face showing a joyous expression. His face also had a few touches of genuine surprise, as if he had just coincidentally met Nangong Ping.

But no matter how well Nangong Fei concealed it, he couldn’t escape Su Nantian’s notice.

Su Nantian hadn’t missed the look of determination on Nangong Fei’s face when he saw Nangong Ping. Why had he shown that expression? It clearly indicated he was waiting for Nangong Ping here!

“Uncle Fei.”

Indeed, Nangong Ping hadn’t noticed anything wrong. When he saw Nangong Fei, he also smiled: “Why did you come today? You should have told me beforehand!”

After saying this, Nangong Ping smiled and took a step forward to pat Nangong Fei’s shoulder, acting like good brothers.

“I just suddenly missed the grandfather and wanted to see you guys too. I thought you were so busy, I might not be able to meet you. But it turned out I was lucky enough to run into Uncle Fei here.”

Nangong Fei had no flaws in his performance. After saying this, he even modestly rubbed the back of his head as if he were truly naive.

“But, Uncle Fei, are you planning to go out now?”

Nangong Fei didn’t continue acting and quickly shifted the topic, revealing his tail.

After saying this, Nangong Fei didn’t wait for Nangong Ping to speak and continued with an anxious expression: “I won’t disturb Uncle Ping, will I? It’s too much for me to bother you. This is really too embarrassing!”

After saying this, Nangong Fei’s anxiety became even more obvious. One could almost feel his sorrow alongside him. He muttered softly: “Indeed, everyone is right; I am a failure who can’t do anything.”

Upon hearing Nangong Fei’s words, Nangong Ping immediately showed a genuine concern on his face.

Others might not understand Nangong Fei, but Nangong Ping and he had the same experiences. They both understood Nangong Fei’s thoughts instantly.

Nangong Fei was always seen as a failure by everyone, and although Nangong Ping was slightly better, he had also been criticized behind his back for being too ordinary.

This feeling was most familiar to Nangong Ping.

“Why are you talking nonsense? What’s there to disturb?”

Nangong Ping thought of this and immediately spoke: “It’s not a big deal. It’s just an ordinary meeting with Master Wu Chuan to discuss the bidding.”

The Nangong family’s participation in the wetland bidding plan was a given fact and publicly known, so Nangong Ping didn’t need to hide it from Nangong Fei. He directly told him.

“Uncle Ping is truly capable; you can even discuss important matters with Master Wu Chuan.”

Nangong Fei said this, then showed a look of envy. He subtly flattered Nangong Ping: “If only I had Uncle Ping’s abilities.”

Upon hearing this, Nangong Ping’s eyebrows lifted with a hint of joy. He waved his hand and didn’t wait for Su Nantian to remind him: “What’s the big deal? You can come with me too!”

Nangong Fei achieved his goal and immediately thanked him: “Thank you, Uncle Ping!”

Chapter 658: Discussion

“Hey! We are all family. Why are you being so polite with me?”

After receiving thanks, Nangong Ping waved his hand and smiled happily.

Nangong Fei continued to say countless compliments from the side.

Su Nantian had long known that Nangong Fei was not sincere, and although he had realized Nangong Fei’s hidden intentions, he still couldn’t resist his persistent attempts to engage with Nangong Ping.

Therefore, seeing that Nangong Ping had agreed to take Nangong Fei along, Su Nantian didn’t interrupt them tactlessly. After all, the deed was done, and he also wanted to see what Nangong Fei had planned.

During the journey, because of Nangong Fei’s presence, they couldn’t rest even in the car. Especially since he kept talking to Nangong Ping and his words were all flattery and subtle praise, making Nangong Ping’s smile never fade since he got into the car.

Su Nantian quickly turned his gaze away, looking straight ahead without glancing elsewhere. He thought that the ability to speak nonsense was also one of Nangong Fei’s skills, and it might not be something others could learn.

Thinking of this, Su Nantian’s lips curled slightly into a meaningful smile, but it appeared and disappeared quickly, so fast that no one else saw it.

Soon, under Nangong Fei’s endless chatter, they arrived at the hotel where Wu Chuan had made an appointment.

After getting out of the car, Nangong Fei secretly smiled with a sinister expression in the place where Nangong Ping couldn’t see, as if he had successfully executed his plan. However, the mantis was about to catch the cicada, and the oriole was waiting in ambush. He hadn’t been discovered by Nangong Ping, but Su Nantian had caught him in the act.

“Is this where Uncle Ping and Master Wu Chuan made an appointment?”

After entering the hotel, Nangong Fei showed a look of curiosity and continuously glanced around, as if he had never seen such a luxurious hotel before.

This behavior revealed his foolishness completely, without any pretense. However, to Su Nantian, this behavior seemed exaggerated and overdone.

Like Nangong Fei was originally a nephew of the Nangong family, he wasn’t short of money. Even if he was a failure, he shouldn’t display all his thoughts on his face; otherwise, it would make him seem like a poor rural boy.

Going deeper, it might also make people think the Nangong family was mistreating Nangong Fei or intentionally making him suffer. Otherwise, why would a good family nephew appear so destitute?

“Right, when you meet Master Wu Chuan, don’t talk too much and don’t be afraid. Just stay by Brother Biao’s side quietly, okay?”

Nangong Fei’s acting was only enough to trick Nangong Ping into simple amusement.

Upon hearing Nangong Fei’s words, Nangong Ping also thought of Nangong Fei’s past behavior and was worried he might do something that would embarrass the family. Thus, he gave a warning beforehand to let him adapt.

But Su Nantian didn’t miss the flicker of anger in Nangong Fei’s eyes. He clearly felt that he had been looked down upon by Nangong Ping.

But Nangong Fei didn’t think about it first; he had been treated this way because of his deliberate performance. If he hadn’t constantly displayed his failure image, would Nangong Ping have given him such a warning?

Today he was looked down upon by Nangong Ping, which was his own doing.

Thinking of this, Su Nantian’s lips curled slightly again. If this trend continued, the internal conflict within the Nangong family would surely be fierce.

“Haha, thank you, Uncle Ping. I will stay by your side quietly and won’t say anything or cause trouble for you and Uncle.”

However, Nangong Fei had practiced this act for years. His performance was so deep that even though he was dissatisfied with Nangong Ping’s words, he still appeared natural. He even showed gratitude for Nangong Ping’s kindness.

“Then, Uncle Ping! Let’s go in quickly! We can’t let Master Wu Chuan wait too long.”

Nangong Fei reminded again, showing an eager expression.

“Right, let’s go in.”

Nangong Ping nodded and walked in first. Nangong Fei followed closely behind, keeping a step distance to visibly distinguish their statuses.

As for Su Nantian, the bodyguard’s identity was also respectful and obedient, following behind them without overstepping.

When they entered the private room, Wu Chuan had already arrived earlier.

Wu Chuan stood up immediately upon seeing them and greeted with a smile. His facial expressions were warm, appearing very amiable. However, those familiar with Wu Chuan’s methods knew he was merely a smiling tiger and not truly amiable.

Moreover, within the inland port circle, there was an old legend about how Wu Chuan had risen to prominence among the younger generation.

Back then, the head of the Wu family wanted to choose a young right-hand man and selected among his relatives.

At that time, Wu Liang had stood out, and the head of the family had greatly appreciated him. In contrast, Wu Chuan hadn’t shown much promise at that time and was quite ordinary.

However, in the final challenge, Wu Chuan had completely changed his image and used methods that no one could have anticipated to torment the enemy, extracting valuable information from their mouths.

It was this that earned him the head of the family’s favor.

This alone indicated Wu Chuan’s talent and courage, but his later methods were the most terrifying. After gaining the head of the family’s trust, he returned to his usual demeanor—gentle and not aggressive.

But after the head of the family passed away, Wu Chuan had ruthlessly eliminated anyone capable of becoming the next patriarch. Originally, there were many descendants in the Wu family, but under Wu Chuan’s methods, the direct line had almost died out. Only he himself and Wu Tao and his wife remained.

Su Nantian returned to reality, refocusing on Wu Chuan.

Wu Chuan seemed to notice his gaze and looked back at him with a meaningful glance, then slightly curled his lips, using this action to imply something to Su Nantian.

Su Nantian narrowed his eyes, naturally understanding what Wu Chuan’s gaze meant. However, he quickly suppressed his expression and pretended not to have noticed it at all, without looking back in Wu Chuan’s direction.

Su Nantian was also diligently stationed at the entrance of the private room, not sitting down. He appeared to be a bodyguard with no other identity.

Chapter 659: Implication

“Dear nephew, please sit down. I’ve been looking forward to meeting you.”

Wu Chuan quickly adjusted his facial expression and politely pulled Nangong Ping over.

He had called Nangong Ping “Master Nangong” yesterday, but today he changed to “Dear nephew,” subtly bridging their relationship. It seemed they were already very familiar.

Nangong Ping showed a slight surprise, unsure of Wu Chuan’s intention behind this polite demeanor. However, he quickly recalled Su Nantian’s previous advice and Wu Chuan’s analysis, then calmed down.

Nangong Ping had been reminding himself that his meeting with Wu Chuan represented the Nangong family’s image. He was not a naive young man who would be easily startled.

After reminding himself, Nangong Ping’s expression became calm and composed. He met Wu Chuan with a balanced demeanor, engaging in light conversation.

Seeing Nangong Ping’s progress, Su Nantian raised his eyebrows and was slightly surprised. However, he quickly shook his head, dismissing this thought.

Nangong Ping was still malleable and not entirely a rough stone, but he was still inexperienced. Su Nantian could guess his inner thoughts from the slight changes in his expression. How much more so for Wu Chuan, a veteran fox?

Moreover, even if Nangong Ping had room to grow and was willing to learn diligently, it was already a critical moment with no time or opportunity for him to grow.

Thus, Su Nantian could only feel sorry for Nangong Ping in his heart because he had already guessed that whether it was the internal conflict within the Nangong family or the competition with other families in the inland port, Nangong Ping was destined to be a loser.

“Dear nephew, you truly know how to speak.”

As Su Nantian was thinking, Wu Chuan and Nangong Ping had exchanged some pleasantries. Wu Chuan politely praised Nangong Ping and then turned his gaze to Nangong Fei sitting beside Nangong Ping.

“This is the famous Uncle Fei, right? Indeed, reputation falls short of reality. Uncle Fei truly is a man of talent and grace.”

Wu Chuan seemed to have just noticed Nangong Fei, and upon seeing him, he immediately offered a wave of praise.

But these praises were better left unsaid.

Anyone could see that Nangong Fei was a well-known failure, and this illusion had been deliberately created by him. Now it had been exposed by Wu Chuan.

Moreover, Wu Chuan specifically used the terms “talent and grace” to describe Nangong Fei, adding his sincere tone. It was unclear whether he meant it genuinely or was mocking Nangong Fei.

A fox against an old fox, naturally, Nangong Fei was no match.

Nangong Fei remained silent for a long time after hearing Wu Chuan’s words, his face slightly flushed. He almost couldn’t hold back.

“Master Wu, you’re too kind. Uncle Fei is just shy; don’t tease him.”

Nangong Ping, seeing Nangong Fei being mocked by Wu Chuan, immediately spoke up to defend him. He intended to deflect Wu Chuan’s scrutiny, but his intention was good, yet he lacked the sharpness of a person with seven holes.

His words seemed to be defending Nangong Fei, but in reality, he was also implying that Nangong Fei was a failure and couldn’t match Wu Chuan’s praise.

Indeed, after Nangong Ping said this, Nangong Fei’s expression, which had been struggling to hold back, became even more difficult. His ears also turned red.

“Master Wu and Uncle Ping can talk, I need to go to the restroom.”

Nangong Fei suddenly spoke up and apologized before leaving.

“Oh, okay.”

Nangong Ping didn’t think much of it and said to Su Nantian: “Then, Su Nantian, accompany Uncle Fei.”

“Yes, Master.”

Su Nantian didn’t object at all. He respectfully nodded and led the way, waiting for Nangong Fei to exit first.

Then Su Nantian followed closely behind Nangong Fei, and before exiting, he lingered his fingers on the door handle for a moment, attaching a small device to it before leaving.

Su Nantian never fought without preparation. Even if he was just accompanying Nangong Ping for a meeting, he hadn’t forgotten to prepare all the equipment.

For example, this small device attached to the door handle was a miniature eavesdropping device. This way, even if he was temporarily sent away or stayed too long in certain places, he wouldn’t miss any conversation.

Moreover, the corresponding receiver of this eavesdropping device was also very small. The receiver had been attached to Su Nantian’s ear all the time, providing a dual precaution.

Even if the eavesdropping device was discovered, the conversation would not be missed.

And when the eavesdropping device wasn’t discovered, he didn’t need to go back to retrieve it. He could simply press the remote destruction button to erase all evidence, avoiding being caught with proof when returning.

“Uncle Fei, the restroom is here. Can I wait for you outside?”

Su Nantian spoke while keeping an eye on the conversation inside the private room and also engaged in a brief dialogue with Nangong Fei.

He naturally knew that Nangong Fei wasn’t simply going to the restroom for a moment. However, his purpose had nothing to do with him and didn’t conflict with him. Thus, Su Nantian was willing to play along, pretending not to know anything.

“Su Nantian, I know you and I are both unwilling to be subordinate.”

As Su Nantian thought that Nangong Fei was going to the restroom to calm down, Nangong Fei suddenly stopped and turned to face Su Nantian.

“Uncle Fei? I don’t understand your meaning.”

Su Nantian was slightly surprised, but he didn’t show it on his face. “I really like working for the Nangong family, and Master, Young Master, and Miss Yuyan have never treated me poorly. They’ve trusted me and been good to me.”

Su Nantian added a few more statements to strengthen his argument.

“Haha, you don’t need to hide it. Su Nantian, you can deceive others, but not me.”

Nangong Fei let out a light laugh and his tone became slightly cold. His eyes also turned icy, like those of a cold-blooded animal without any emotion.

At this moment, Nangong Fei’s appearance was completely different from his usual harmless demeanor.

Su Nantian also knew that this was Nangong Fei’s true nature.

Nangong Fei interrupted Su Nantian and continued to speak coldly: “Don’t act like that. You and I are the same type of people. Your ambition is just as great as mine, overflowing to the point it can’t be contained. It’s impossible to hide.”

After saying this, Nangong Fei directly met Su Nantian’s eyes, as if he had already discovered Su Nantian’s true identity.

Chapter 660: Secretly Buying Off

“Uncle Fei is mistaken. I have no ambition, and I am fully devoted to the Nangong family.”

Su Nantian answered this sentence with his mouth, but in his mind, he had completely different thoughts. At the same time, his brain was racing to guess Nangong Fei’s main purpose in saying these words.
