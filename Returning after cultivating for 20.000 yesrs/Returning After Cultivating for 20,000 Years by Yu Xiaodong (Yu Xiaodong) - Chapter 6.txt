The young man watched his girlfriend's performance with great satisfaction, his small eyes narrowing further. His smile deepened.

The office worker turned to Lin Suyun and said, "Sorry," returning the card. Then he hurriedly ran back.

A short while later, a woman with heavy makeup rushed out in haste.

"Ah, it's Mr. Wang."

"Mr. Wang, you haven't come to this small shop in a long time. The new employee here was rude earlier, I'm sorry. Let me fetch you some clothes."

"Apologies again, Miss. Please choose another piece of clothing."

The woman turned to Lin Suyun and said this, then ignored her completely. She grabbed a piece of clothing from the side and handed it to Su Nantian.

"Sir, would you like to try this piece of clothing?"

Su Nantian didn't move. A cold glint flashed in his eyes.

At this moment, Lin Suyun was furious. The world truly had such scoundrels who could be found anywhere.

Lin Suyun stared at the heavily made-up woman and questioned her aloud:

"Are you certain you're the manager here?"

"Of course. Do you think you are the manager here?"

"This gentleman is the general manager of Haolin Real Estate. He's young but already has millions in assets. You can't afford to provoke him."

The heavily made-up woman, upon seeing someone dare question her identity, immediately became displeased.

"Another manager. Now anyone can be a manager?"

Lin Suyun was very unhappy, and Su Nantian's expression darkened.

The woman beside the small-eyed man didn't hesitate. She slapped Lin Suyun without thinking.

Su Nantian's eyes turned even colder.

In an instant, he was at Lin Suyun's side and delivered a kick. The woman flew back several meters.

The small-eyed man immediately widened his eyes, looking like a crab ready to bite or strangle.

"You again. Who are you? Daring to touch my woman."

"I'm Su Nantian. Not only do I touch your woman, but I also touch you."

Saying this, he patted him on the waist.

"What are you doing?"

The small-eyed man was about to scold. He immediately felt something was wrong. He couldn't hold his urine and turned red-faced, pointing at Su Nantian for a long time without speaking.

He hurriedly ran towards the restroom ahead. He urinated all the way.

Chapter 23: Continuous Blows

The heavily made-up woman stared in shock at the man, Wang, running toward the restroom looking utterly embarrassed. She had no idea what happened. Then she pointed at Su Nantian and cursed, "Wait here. If you have the courage not to leave, see how Mr. Wang will punish you."

Lin Suyun looked at the woman before her, very puzzled. She didn't know where this woman got such confidence to speak so arrogantly and disrespectfully, like a robber. It was really annoying.

Lin Suyun no longer paid attention to her. She took out a phone and dialed a number.

Ding ding ding...

The heavily made-up woman watched Lin Suyun calling on the phone and felt very triumphant, her eyes even more contemptuous. She continued: "Now you're afraid? It's too late, even if you call for help it won't be useful."

A short while later, the other end of the phone connected.

"Xiaoxi, replace the manager at the Fan Zhesi store on Nan Yuan Street."

After Lin Suyun said this, she didn't wait for a response and hung up. She didn't even glance at the heavily made-up woman. In fact, this Fan Zhesi store was her own company's, although she rarely came here. She clearly knew this.

The heavily made-up woman heard this and immediately mocked, "Stop pretending. Do you really think one phone call can fire me? Do you think you're the boss of this company? Stop pretending..."

The heavily made-up woman hadn't finished speaking when her phone rang from her pocket. Seeing an unknown number, she hung up immediately.

"Probably another sales call. So annoying."

She hadn't even realized this phone call was made by this woman.

As soon as she said this, the phone rang again. It was still that number.

After hesitating for a while, she answered the call.

But soon the conversation ended. The heavily made-up woman's expression was very dramatic, from her previous self-assuredness to now being completely defeated. Her facial muscles hadn't adapted yet, and her expression was very strange, filled with disbelief.

"This is impossible. One phone call tricked me. How could you be...?"

She was panicked but didn't believe what she just heard.

Ding!

She quickly checked her phone message. When she saw the deposit amount in her bank account, she collapsed to the ground.

"Now you believe it. You can pack your things and leave."

Only now did she realize she had truly been fired. She hadn't known who she had offended, who could fire her with just one phone call.

If she knew, even ten times the courage wouldn't have made her say those words.

But there's no "if" in this world.

Lin Suyun let out a light snort, showing no sympathy. She turned to the small shop employee who had previously served them and said, "From now on, you are the manager of this store."

The small shop employee looked at Lin Suyun in disbelief. She had only been here for less than half a year, and she never imagined becoming the manager.

Seeing the small shop employee's bewildered expression, Lin Suyun said:

"Don't worry. After company system training, you can definitely handle it. Do your best."

After saying this, Lin Suyun turned and left. The small shop employee stared at Lin Suyun's departing back, her mouth slightly open, forgetting to say even a thank you.

"South Heaven, let's go."

Lin Suyun naturally took Su Nantian's hand and walked out.

The man who had urinated everywhere, Wang, just came out of the restroom. He looked at Su Nantian's departing back with full hatred. He glanced at his girlfriend lying on the ground and the manager who was still dazed.

He immediately approached and scolded, "What are you still standing here for? Hurry up and get me a piece of clothing."

After saying this, no one responded. He stomped his foot in anger, eyes flashing with hostility, gritting his teeth and enduring the discomfort. He turned and left.

...

After buying clothes, it was already dark. The two decided to go directly to Huiyun Residence for the class reunion.

Su Nantian hadn't expected this store was Lin Suyun's.

He glanced at Lin Suyun driving, the wind blowing her long black hair up. Her pale face was clearly visible. Her skin looked as if it could be pierced, brighter in the night. Su Nantian watched her and was momentarily stunned.

He himself hadn't noticed that his cold heart from two thousand years of cultivation had slightly stirred.

Lin Suyun seemed to sense it. She turned her head and saw Su Nantian staring at her. Her heart beat like a rabbit, and two red spots appeared on her cheeks.

"What? Did you fall for me?"

After saying this, Lin Suyun regretted it. Her heart beat faster. She could hear it clearly. Excited yet afraid, she listened carefully for Su Nantian's answer.

Afraid of hearing an answer she didn't want, she immediately said again: "Let's go to the class reunion right away. I just happen to be missing a boyfriend, and you're it."

"Then, since you so kindly invited me, I'll reluctantly be your boyfriend."

Su Nantian looked at Lin Suyun's red face and smiled. When had she become shy?

Hearing this, Lin Suyun felt a big stone in her heart fall. She couldn't describe the joy but still stubbornly said, "Reluctantly! How many people are chasing me? You just enjoy it."

The two of them bickered back and forth, and they soon arrived at Huiyun Residence.

Lin Suyun parked the car. As she got out, someone called her. She turned around and saw the class monitor Xu Tian and several other classmates getting out of their cars.

"Suyun, I didn't expect you to come. I thought you wouldn't."

Xu Tian smiled and extended his hand, but Su Nantian stepped forward.

They shook hands. Their eyes met, sparks flying.

Xu Tian looked at Lin Suyun with confusion.

"Who is this?"

Oh, I forgot to introduce. This is our high school classmate Su Nantian. He's my boyfriend now."

When Lin Suyun said "boyfriend," she secretly glanced at Su Nantian.

Hearing this, Xu Tian's face stiffened. However, he quickly recovered his smile. He had planned to pursue her at this class reunion after learning she was the granddaughter of the Lin family. But he hadn't expected a boyfriend to appear.

"This isn't my fault, Xu Tian. It's because I've become too handsome. If you didn't recognize me tomorrow, it was deserved."

Su Nantian added another blow with a smiling face.

Their hands gripped tighter. Soon Xu Fei showed signs of pain.

"Sorry, sorry. I've been working out recently and my strength has increased too much. I didn't control it well."

Su Nantian, seeing this, immediately let go and added another blow with an apology.

Xu Tian's face turned very ugly. He shook his hand and said, "It's okay. We're all classmates."

Chapter 24: Holding Hands, Kissing

Hearing this, a dark-faced young man behind Xu Tian pointed at Su Nantian and said, "I remember you used to be timid. How could you become so handsome? Can you treat the class monitor like this?"

Su Nantian smiled gently, looking down from his heart at this dark-faced man.

"Cao Guangliang. How come? Do you still want to beg for mercy like you used to? It's been so long, and you're still the same."

Cao Guangliang's face turned from black to purple. Hearing Su Nantian mention his old wounds, a wave of anger surged up. He immediately raised his fist to punch Su Nantian.

Xu Tian watched this and saw Cao Guangliang about to attack. He stepped forward in front of him and said, "Guangliang, we're all classmates. Why start fighting right away? Su Nantian, it's old news. Don't bring up your classmates' past hurts."

After saying this, he pulled Cao Guangliang forward towards the entrance of Huiyun Residence.

Su Nantian smiled at these people, a cold glint in his eyes.

Lin Suyun looked at Su Nantian, different from usual.

She asked aloud: "What's wrong with you today? You seem different from usual. Usually, you're cold and distant. What's happening now?"

Su Nantian took Lin Suyun's delicate hand and said with a smile, "It's because I'm happy to see old classmates today. Besides, today I am your boyfriend. How could I let others take advantage of you?"

Lin Suyun said playfully, "Does that mean you can take advantage of me?"

"What do you call taking advantage? I'm your boyfriend. Holding hands and kissing each other is quite normal, right?"

Kissing each other!

Lin Suyun heard this and her face turned red to her ears. Her heart had a little expectation. The other hand suddenly grabbed Su Nantian's waist and twisted it hard, biting her teeth and saying: "You think you're so lucky."

Su Nantian played along with a few cries.

In fact, he felt no pain at all. It was just that Lin Suyun's strength was too small.

Xu Tian heard the flirtatious sounds behind him, his eyes full of jealousy and anger. What right did this poor guy have to be with the Lin family's daughter? What qualification did he have to show off in front of him? Thinking about this, he coldly sneered and vowed to make him look foolish.

Xu Tian entered Huiyun Residence, his eyes immediately brightened. This place truly was the top restaurant in Fengcheng. It had such a beautiful female pianist. Xu Tian's eyes were so engrossed they became straight.

A moment later, he had a plan. He decided to wait until everyone arrived before executing his strategy and make Su Nantian look bad.

He restrained his inner excitement, and under the guidance of a server, he entered room 219.

Since Su Nantian was no longer wearing his previous divine robe and otherworldly appearance, he didn't draw attention. Although he had become a celebrity for a while, countless new celebrities appeared every day on the internet. After sleeping, who would remember? Even if Su Nantian still had that handsome face, the world's most common thing was beautiful women and handsome men. Although they were eye-catching, it was just a few glances.

Moreover, in this high-end restaurant like Huiyun Residence, the flow of people was large. There were many handsome men and beautiful women everywhere.

Thus Su Nantian followed the crowd into room 219.

Lin Suyun was about to sit down when Xu Tian said, "Although we haven't seen each other for a long time, sit next to me."

Xu Tian pointed at the chair beside him and looked at Lin Suyun with hope.

"No, I'll sit here."

After saying this, Lin Suyun pulled Su Nantian and sat on the other side of the entrance.

Hearing Lin Suyun's refusal, Xu Tian was embarrassed and smiled. Then he looked at Su Nantian with hatred.

"Xu Tian, I heard you started a company and went through several rounds of financing. Now your assets are in the millions. You're really impressive."

"Yes, I also heard that you're the best among us."

"Indeed, the class monitor is the most outstanding."

"That's not it. The class monitor is the best in our class."

...

Seeing the awkward atmosphere, several people sitting nearby immediately praised Xu Tian.

Others heard this and looked at Xu Tian with envy.

Xu Tian enjoyed the compliments from everyone.

He turned to Su Nantian and said, "Everyone has been talking about me. What about our Su Nantian? How is he doing?"

After saying this, others looked at Su Nantian with malicious joy.

Su Nantian thought for a moment but hadn't spoken yet. Immediately, someone said:

"Did you lose your job?"

"Hahaha."

Some people heard this and laughed immediately.

Actually, Su Nantian was very solitary in high school. He had few friends but many enemies. Actually, he didn't want to come today. He just wanted to see that old classmate, his only friend in high school. He didn't know why he hadn't come yet.

At the moment everyone was laughing, the door opened.

"What are you all laughing about? So happy. Tell me."

Another tall and thin man with glasses came in.

Su Nantian saw the person entering the door, who was his long-awaited friend, Zhang Mu.

He immediately waved and said:

"Zhang Mu, come sit here. He pulled her to the seat beside him."

Zhang Mu looked at the person before him, hesitated for a while, then said: "Are you Su Nantian?"

"Of course. It's genuine."

Su Nantian smiled.

Xu Tian felt the atmosphere he had just created was destroyed by Zhang Mu, and his heart was quite annoyed.

"Zhang Mu, you came so late. You have to self-punish three cups."

"Yes."

"Quickly fill Zhang Mu up."

Others heard Xu Tian speak and immediately echoed.

Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle. Three cups down, Zhang Mu's face also turned slightly red.

Xu Tian continued: "We were just talking about introducing Su Nantian to a job. You came at the right time, so you can help."

"Isn't it simple? Just go to your place, Tian. You just need to assign a job."

Cao Guangliang saw the opportunity and immediately spoke: "You're already working at my company. If Su Nantian can come to work, I can humiliate him every day."

Thinking of this, he smiled so much his mouth couldn't close.

"Right, Tian. We can't let a brother starve."

"Five thousand yuan a month. It's quite good, with some savings left over."

Hearing this, everyone returned to Su Nantian's topic and immediately mocked him. If Xu Tian was happy today, he might be able to help himself later. Everyone had their own little plans.

"South Heaven, maybe go to my place first. I've got a small project. Taking care of you is no problem."

Chapter 25: Invite the Pianist

Upon hearing this, Zhang Mu immediately became unhappy. Su Nantian had always been at odds with the class monitor and others. If he went there, it would be no good. Although his own life wasn't great, helping a friend was definitely enough.

Xu Tian's face had just recovered when it darkened again. If Su Nantian went to Zhang Mu's place, wouldn't his plan be ruined?

"Zhang Mu, don't pretend. Your small project was already transferred to someone else for your father's medical expenses, right? Now you're just a worker. You don't have the ability anymore."

Sitting beside Xu Tian, Cao Guangliang noticed his subtle facial expressions and immediately spoke.

He had done some research on Zhang Mu before coming. He even knew about Su Nantian being fired. All of this was to please Xu Tian.

Hearing this, Zhang Mu's expression darkened. His already weak body seemed to deflate like a deflated balloon.

Seeing Zhang Mu's expression, Su Nantian knew most of what they said was true. He patted Zhang Mu's shoulder and looked at Xu Tian's group, saying: "Everyone's kindness is understood. Don't bother yourself. I haven't reached the point of sleeping on the street yet."

"Haha, of course. A little boyfriend who's taken care of by the Lin family. How could he not have a job? Right, Tian?"

A girl spoke up, her eyes full of jealousy at Lin Suyun. If it weren't for this woman, how could Tian not even glance at her.

Cao Guangliang continued: "The clothes on your body, did the Lin family's daughter buy them for you? Fan Zhesi clothes aren't cheap."

Hearing these people constantly mocking Su Nantian, Lin Suyun stood up and said: "You don't deserve to be classmates. South Heaven, let's go."

Hearing Lin Suyun wanted to leave, Xu Tian immediately stood up with a glass of wine and said: "Suyun, they just spoke straight. I'll self-punish a cup and apologize to you."

Hearing Xu Tian's apology, the people who had spoken immediately stood up and raised their glasses to drink.

Only the girl who had called Su Nantian a little boyfriend remained seated, doing nothing.

Xu Tian's eyebrows furrowed. Cao Guangliang immediately scolded: "Ye Qing, what are you still doing sitting here? Get up and apologize for what you said earlier."

Ye Qing looked at Cao Guangliang with a sidelong glance,不满. She picked up the glass and took a sip.

She thought to herself: You're just Xu Tian's lackey. What right do you have to scold me?

All her dissatisfaction was shown on her flirtatious face.

"Xu Tian, I tell you, I don't know you. Please call me Lin Suyun."

Lin Suyun couldn't stand the dirty faces of these people and showed no intention of accepting Xu Tian's apology. She continued to curse.

Xu Tian stood there awkwardly, unsure what to say for a moment.

"Suyun, sit down first. The gathering has just started. We should watch their performance before leaving."

Su Nantian wanted to know what kind of performance these people had. Did they only have such small tricks?

Lin Suyun felt the warmth in her hand and the calm, deep eyes. She let out a light snort but sat down anyway.

"Since Lin Suyun is staying, how about inviting the pianist downstairs to play a piece for us?"

Xu Tian looked at their affectionate behavior and felt more hatred. He vowed to crush Su Nantian under his feet, letting him watch his woman breathe in another's arms helplessly.

Thinking of this, his unhappiness reduced a lot. He smiled and said: "That's great. It's not very clear upstairs. If we can invite the pianist up, it would be even better."

"Long have I heard that the pianist downstairs is an expert in both skill and beauty. If we can invite her to play a piece, it would be worth the trip."

"Indeed, I also think this suggestion is very good. But I heard it's not an ordinary pianist. It seems she's the disciple of the famous musician Mr. Fang. You probably can't invite her up, right?"

Zhang Mu was angry at this point.

"Hmph. You probably don't know yet, Tian. That's the chairman of Tielong Audio-Visual Company. Inviting a pianist up is just a small task for him."

Everyone looked at each other, with understanding expressions.

"Haha, that's right. Tian is a rising star. He started his company in just a few years and made it famous. Please, Tian."

Xu Tian was very happy hearing this. He looked deeply at Su Nantian and turned to leave the room, walking outside.

Su Nantian didn't care about Xu Tian's gaze and even felt like laughing. If he could invite her up, a toad would eat swan meat.

Watching Xu Tian's back as he left, the people who had praised him earlier were very eager. They all stared at the door, mentally preparing their words on how to talk to that beautiful pianist.

Suddenly, the music stopped. Everyone's faces showed joy.

"It must be Tian who invited the pianist up."

"Indeed, it's still Tian's strength."

"Hmph. What did some people say earlier? I didn't hear clearly."

"Haha."

...

A short while later, the door creaked open.

Everyone didn't see the expected pianist but only Xu Tian with a very bad face walking in. They all looked at each other in confusion.

As soon as he entered, he cursed: "Bitch, giving you face and you don't take it. You even made me leave. Hmph, I'll deal with you later."

Xu Tian was very angry. A poor kid had been annoying him and now a disrespectful pianist.

Cao Guangliang saw the plan failed. He brought a glass of water forward and said: "Tian, calm down. It's not worth getting sick over one person."

He leaned forward and whispered in Xu Tian's ear: "You can still find a chance later. When she lies on the bed, it'll be all yours."

After saying this, both of them smiled mischievously.

The people who had praised earlier also laughed without understanding.

Cao Guangliang turned to Zhang Mu and said: "What did you mean by what you said earlier? So, can you invite the pianist up?"

Su Nantian saw the blame directed at Zhang Mu and coldly said: "Some people lack ability but blame others. I think it's because he's too ugly and scared the girl away."

This statement made the room instantly silent. A deathly silence, with a smoky smell spreading everywhere.

Chapter 26: Bigger than Your Chest

"Young man, don't push it. Just be a little boyfriend quietly."

Cao Guangliang immediately scolded him. He was very jealous of Su Nantian's current appearance. Why was he still so dark? Why did the person he had looked down on become white, while he became darker?

Su Nantian didn't answer but stared coldly at Xu Tian. He had heard what the two of them said, and they were just trash.

Xu Tian forced down his anger and spoke coldly: "You're so handsome, taken care of so well. It's a pity not to try. You might even double fly!"

"Lin Suyun, this little boyfriend of yours is looking at other women while he's being taken care of. He doesn't even value you."

Ye Qing saw this and felt very happy. She loved seeing such overconfident people struggle.

"First take care of yourself. What are you wearing? Don't know who you're trying to flirt with."

Lin Suyun glanced at her. Facing these former classmates, she was really disgusted.

"Su Nantian, don't argue with this person."

"Xu Tian, let's make a bet. If I can invite the pianist downstairs to play, will you kneel and call me three times 'father'?"

"What are you talking about? It's a joke."

"Don't be silly. Even Tian can't do it, so you just give up."

"Haha." Others all laughed and looked at Su Nantian like he was a fool.

"That's the best joke I've heard this year."

"I'm dying laughing, hahaha."

"You really think you can invite her up? If you do, I'll call you three times 'father'. Can you afford this meal? Oh, I forgot. With the Lin family's daughter around, you don't lack money!"

"Haha."

Others echoed and laughed together.

Xu Tian thought he had heard the funniest joke in the world. A poor kid with no job, pretending to be rich before him. The meal at Huiyun Residence would cost tens of thousands. How could this kid afford it?

Moreover, he had just angered the pianist below. Today she definitely wouldn't come to room 219.

"Rest assured, I'll fulfill your desperate wish. The money is mine. As a father, I invite my sons to dinner. How could I let them pay? It would be embarrassing if it were known, right?"

Su Nantian's cold eyes swept over the group.

"Don't speak so much. Who are you to call me son?"

Some people heard this and immediately protested.

"Ah? Then it's grandson. So as a grandfather, I have to send a red envelope... I won't do a losing deal."

Su Nantian looked at these grandsons with mockery.

"You..."

"Okay, I'll bet you. The key is, what if you lose?"

Xu Tian raised his hand and immediately the room fell silent. He looked at Su Nantian with a triumphant expression, his eyes greedy as he scanned Lin Suyun's full chest. His inner fire was almost uncontrollable.

"What do you say? You can decide."

Su Nantian calmly spoke.

"Hmph... your words are bold. But how much ability do you have?"

Ye Qing looked at Su Nantian with mockery.

"Even if it's small, it's bigger than your chest."

Su Nantian looked at Ye Qing's flat and exposed private area, mocking her.

"Can't even take care of yourself. Still meddling in others' business. Don't think about how to apologize to Tian later. Your words are sharp."

Ye Qing hated it when people talked about her. Because she was small, she often got looked down on and remained a virgin.

Su Nantian gave Lin Suyun and Zhang Mu a reassuring glance. Under the watchful eyes of everyone, he walked out.

As soon as Su Nantian stepped out, Cao Guangliang volunteered to go with him and left room 219.

Su Nantian went downstairs and saw Wu Lianxing calmly closing her eyes, with two security guards standing by.

That's why Xu Tian was so confident.

As soon as Su Nantian entered Wu Lianxing's presence, he was blocked by the security guards.

"Don't come closer. Stay away."

These two security guards were also upset, having just been scolded by their superiors. They were in a bad mood and had another fool.

"Two of you, I'm a friend of this pianist..."

Su Nantian had just started to speak when he was interrupted.

"Stop talking. Go somewhere else and cool off. If you don't leave, we won't be polite."

The two security guards were impatient and scolded him. There had been a previous fake friend, now another.

As the two security guards were mocking Su Nantian in their minds, a clear and pleasant voice came from behind.

"Wait. This is my friend." Wu Lianxing heard a voice she had been waiting for and immediately opened her eyes. She almost jumped with joy, although Su Nantian was no longer wearing that day's long robe. His voice was definitely not wrong.

She quickly calmed her excitement and adjusted her already neat hair.

"May I ask for a favor?"

Su Nantian spoke calmly, his mouth revealing a rare smile.

"By what right do you think I'll help you?" Wu Lianxing asked back.

"Because you've been captivated by my music. Your talent isn't bad either. I can teach you."

Su Nantian gave Wu Lianxing an offer she couldn't refuse.

"You... okay, I accept."

Wu Lianxing had wanted to say he was a narcissist but stopped herself.

Since that day she heard his music, she had wanted to reach that level. Although she listened to the recording many times and improved a bit, there was still no progress. So she had been hoping to see that person again.

"What's your name? How can I help you?"

"Suo Nantian."

"Wu Lianxing."

"I want to ask you to play a piece in room 219."

"What? You want me to go to room 219? Did that scoundrel send you?"

Wu Lianxing immediately became angry upon hearing room 219. Her calmness was furious, and she tightly clenched her fists.

"No, that person isn't even a friend. It's just a bet. If you help with this favor, I can make him apologize to you."

Su Nantian spoke calmly.

"Okay, I accept."

When they finished talking and were about to go upstairs, a crowd had already gathered around them. Everyone was holding their phones taking pictures. A circle of security guards maintained order.

The people downstairs had been waiting for Wu Lianxing's music but it hadn't come. Instead, they saw a man and immediately noticed him, wanting to see if this person would also leave in a miserable way.

Chapter 27: Impossible

But someone with sharp eyes immediately recognized Su Nantian—the handsome man who had suddenly become popular, the "car-crashing" guy. They immediately took out their phones to take pictures. This was first-hand information.

Everyone wanted to get closer to these two people to capture clearer photos.

Cao Guangliang watched this from a distance. Seeing Su Nantian talking to Wu Lianxing, he was shocked. Could he really invite her up?

That day's guy would have to kneel and call him "father." Then he saw many people around had gathered, and soon he couldn't see anything.

He had originally been worried about his success. Now it was almost impossible. Angering the fans would be enough for him.

Hmph, so many people stomping on you could kill you. It seems the pianist has a lot of fans.

He sneered and immediately went upstairs.

"Master Tian, you can be one hundred percent sure. That kid has been surrounded by fans and doesn't need your help."

Cao Guangliang was very pleased. He entered the room and loudly said, straightening his back unconsciously.

He handed over his best cigarette to him. He himself didn't even want to smoke it.

"I knew it. It's what I expected."

Xu Tian was happy and immediately drank the whole glass of wine, blowing a smoke ring.

"Master Tian, you should think carefully about how to deal with this kid."

"Why not make him kneel and call you three times 'grandpa'?"

"Haha, I almost wanted to hit him for you."

Everyone heard the situation was settled and immediately flattered again. Truly, they could bend and stretch.

"Everyone think of a plan that satisfies me. I won't miss out on his benefits."

How is Lin Suyun? Your little boyfriend will soon be under my feet. You don't even beg for him."

Xu Tian almost put his foot on the table but stopped himself. He looked at Lin Suyun with a lecherous gaze.

He wanted to exchange Lin Suyun for Su Nantian.

"Your dream is too early."

Lin Suyun glared at him.

"Is that so? It seems you don't worry at all. Do you think this kid is a fake boyfriend you found? It looks so real."

Xu Tian's greed increased. He continued.

"My business isn't your concern. First, take care of yourself."

Lin Suyun said angrily.

Zhang Mu was anxious and looked at Lin Suyun. He was about to ask, but she gave him a reassuring glance.

Zhang Mu could only suppress his questions and wait patiently.

The door opened again with a creak.

The room instantly fell silent. Everyone looked at the door in unison.

Although they had all heard Cao Guangliang's words, in this moment of revelation,

It was still exciting. Everyone unconsciously fell silent, holding back a pile of mocking words.

The next moment.

He calmly walked into the room.

They were struck by lightning, staring in shock at the person standing at the door. No one spoke.

They had prepared a pile of words but couldn't say even one. How embarrassing it was,

The most shocked were Xu Tian and Cao Guangliang. They completely didn't understand why this was so different from what they had expected.
