"Uncle Wu Chuan, our relationship is quite good. I decided to go the extra mile and lock those containers for you. When your people return, I'll open the locks for them. But I never expected there were people inside instead of goods. I don't understand why they hid here, Uncle Wu Chuan, what do you think?"

Nangong Yayan said this deliberately, as if genuinely helping Wu Chuan. In reality, she was trying to provoke him. She had suffered losses at his hands and wanted to exact revenge by making him angry.

"Oh, I see. Thank you. If that's the case, let's complete the handover now while everyone is here," Wu Chuan said with a forced smile.

Chapter 554: Completing the Handover

Nangong Yayan's words truly infuriated Wu Chuan, but he couldn't argue. Her reasoning was entirely logical—after all, they had come to take over the inland port. Seeing that the goods were unattended and containers unlocked, securing them with a lock was entirely reasonable. How could he blame her for locking them?

Yet Wu Chuan knew she had spoken this way to provoke him. After her arrival, she would have sought their people for a handover but found them hidden in the containers instead. Rather than immediately revealing them, she had used this method to give him a warning when she returned.

Though Wu Chuan was angry, he had to admit Nangong Yayan's tactics were remarkably shrewd. Few of her peers could match her cunning.

But Wu Chuan had no idea this plan was not Nangong Yayan's own. If she had discovered the people inside the containers, she would have immediately exposed them. Instead, it was Su Nantian who had devised this strategy.

Who could have guessed such a plan came from one of Nangong Yayan's own bodyguards?

Wu Chuan realized his trap had failed and smiled, saying, "Ah, I'll personally oversee the handover to give you more confidence. Alright, bring people in—open the office doors and complete the paperwork. For the next year, most of this port's operations will be transferred to the Nangong family. Continue working diligently."

Wu Chuan knew he couldn't clash with Nangong Yayan anymore. He took the opportunity to do her a favor, personally guiding her through the handover to ensure no issues arose.

Nangong Yayan smiled secretly at this scene, knowing she didn't need to do anything else. Going too far was unnecessary—this situation had already achieved her goal.

Wu Chuan personally supervised Nangong Yayan's takeover of part of the inland port, effectively transferring most of its profits to the Nangong family from that day forward.

Yet Nangong Yayan had no fear of Wu Chuan sabotaging the dockworkers later. The port's profitability would eventually return to the Wu family, and any drastic changes in a year would make it difficult for Wu Chuan to restore the status quo.

"Thank you, Uncle Wu Chuan. Let's cooperate well," Nangong Yayan said after completing the paperwork.

"Of course, no need to thank me. It's what I should do. Let's cooperate well. I hope you won't forget our earlier agreement—should the Nangong family need any cooperation, please prioritize us Wu family first."

Wu Chuan spoke humbly but smiled at Nangong Yayan.

"Rest assured, Uncle Wu. Naturally, we have a contract. How could we break our agreement? Well, since today's matters are settled, we'll take our leave. Tomorrow I'll send people to officially take over this inland port."

After saying this, Nangong Yayan turned to Su Nantian standing beside her: "Alright, let's go."

Su Nantian nodded, and Nangong Yayan led her bodyguards and Su Nantian away, boarding their vehicle and driving off.

After Nangong Yayan's group left, Wu Chuan's expression grew increasingly sinister.

His assistant immediately said, "Master, don't be angry. It's bound to happen eventually. Why waste your health?"

"Hmph, Nangong Yayan is truly overstepping. I never expected her to use such a method to force me out. This little girl is no ordinary opponent. If the Nangong family falls under her control, she'll become a formidable rival. Alright, let's not stay here anymore. Let's pack up and leave."

After speaking, Wu Chuan also led his people away from the inland port.

As for those workers who had been released, they naturally returned to their usual routines.

On the way back, Nangong Yayan said to Su Nantian: "Nantian, this time we managed the handover smoothly. You deserve the credit. If it weren't for your strategy, we wouldn't have lured Wu Chuan out of his shell. Watching him eat humble pie in front of me was quite satisfying."

"This is merely what I, as a member of the Nangong family, should do," Su Nantian replied humbly.

"I think your mind is quite sharp. Being a bodyguard is such a waste. If I speak to my father, he might assign you a position. I believe your abilities are more than sufficient," Nangong Yayan suddenly said.

If Nangong Yayan's words were true, this would indeed be good news for Su Nantian. After all, he currently served as a bodyguard under the Nangong family, and his movements were always dictated by Nangong Ping.

But if he truly received a position from Nangong Yayan, it would grant him freedom of movement, greatly aiding his efforts to rescue Wu Tao and Wu You'er from the Wu family.

However, Su Nantian wasn't that naive. He simply smiled and shook his head: "Madam's kindness I appreciate, but I am merely a bodyguard. Today's plan was just a coincidence; I don't possess the talent to hold a higher position. Being a bodyguard in the Nangong family is already enough for me."

If Su Nantian had accepted Nangong Yayan's suggestion, it would have caused him great trouble.

After entering the Nangong family just a few days ago, he was already thinking of climbing to a higher position. Worse still, he had forgotten his identity as a bodyguard—this would make people doubt his true intentions.

Thus, if Su Nantian had accepted the proposal, it would have raised Nangong Yayan's suspicions. Once she suspected him, she'd inform Nangong Lin. According to the Nangong family's usual practices, they would keep their distance from him, and he'd never be able to participate in matters concerning the Wu family again. All his careful preparations within the Nangong family would be for nothing.

Chapter 555: Surprise

After Su Nantian and the others returned to the Nangong family, Nangong Yayan sent him back to Nangong Ping's villa while she went to find Nangong Lin.

When Nangong Yayan entered Nangong Lin's villa, she found him sitting in the living room wearing glasses and reading a newspaper. A butler stood beside him. Upon seeing Nangong Yayan, the butler respectfully greeted: "Miss, you've returned. I wonder if this matter went smoothly?"

Before Nangong Yayan could answer, she heard Nangong Lin say from beside him: "Listen to the way she walks—so light and cheerful. Her mood must be quite pleasant. I think this task you assigned to her was completed smoothly."

"Father, you're truly perceptive. The handover has been successfully completed," Nangong Yayan smiled and sat beside Nangong Lin.

"You left early this morning, yet it was so smooth. Did Wu Chuan not try to give you a hard time?" Nangong Lin was skeptical. This wasn't how he remembered Wu Chuan to be. Even if their families were cooperating, the Wu family would never show mercy; they'd definitely give him a warning.

"How could that be? Wu Chuan certainly didn't want me to complete the handover smoothly. When I arrived, the place was empty. The entire office and inland port had no one—not even their leaders or the workers who moved goods." Nangong Yayan said, pouting slightly as she playfully teased Nangong Lin. She was trying to tell him how hard the task had been, hoping he'd remember her efforts.

But Nangong Lin knew his daughter's temperament well. He understood Wu Chuan had definitely set a trap for her, and he'd naturally comfort her upon returning.

"Don't rush to tease me; tell me what happened today first. After you finish, then you can play," Nangong Lin said while indulgently watching his daughter. He was curious about what Wu Chuan had done this time to make everyone disappear.

"I arrived and found no one there. Naturally, I knew Wu Chuan wanted to give me a warning by making the handover difficult. He'll definitely have to transfer it eventually, but he never does so on my terms. However, after a thorough search, do you know where those workers and leaders were hiding?"

Nangong Yayan said this while clearly upset. She still couldn't believe how Wu Chuan had planned this.

"Since they were hiding, they must have been in an obscure place. A thorough search would reveal their traces," Nangong Lin said, not considering finding people difficult or Wu Chuan's plan to hide them in an unexpected place.

"That's because you weren't there. You don't know what happened. Those people were hiding inside the containers. Later, I had someone buy a lock and have them all locked up, then pretended to leave. Inside, they couldn't resist and called Wu Chuan. He sent people to cut the locks outside, then led us out to negotiate with him. We met face-to-face and exchanged words before he escorted me to complete the handover."

Nangong Yayan recounted everything in detail, and Nangong Lin was furious. He threw the newspaper on the table and said: "This Wu Chuan really dared to come up with such a rotten plan to trouble you."

But after saying this, Nangong Lin looked at Nangong Yayan and nodded slightly in approval. "But this time, you've become smarter. I thought after finding those people, you'd immediately expose them. But instead, you waited for the opportunity and turned their plan against them."

"I think your method was very good. Finding those people and exposing them is what a common person would do. But your method was not something an ordinary person could come up with. It also gave Wu Chuan a warning, letting him know the Nangong family isn't easy to provoke."

Nangong Yayan could tell that Nangong Lin was genuinely satisfied with this incident. However, she furrowed her brows because she knew the one who had come up with this plan wasn't herself.

"Father... I must tell you, the one who came up with this plan today wasn't me. According to my thoughts, after locking the doors and forcing them out, I would have immediately exposed them. I never thought of luring Wu Chuan here." Nangong Yayan said, lowering her head in shame. According to Nangong Lin's words, this idea was merely common sense, not something a genius would think of.

So Nangong Yayan felt slightly ashamed, feeling she had betrayed her father's praise. She could tell that Nangong Lin's compliment was sincere, even carrying a hint of pride and admiration.

This was exactly what Nangong Yayan had long desired—her father's genuine praise. But in the end, the plan wasn't hers, which was quite ironic.

After hearing this, Nangong Lin was slightly taken aback and asked: "Who came up with this plan if it wasn't you? The people who went with you today were your bodyguards, right? Did they have such a mind?"

Nangong Yayan shook her head and said: "Because at that time, I was with the bodyguard of my brother. Wu Chuan knew him too. And since I feared something might happen at the inland port, and Zhang Yu wasn't around, I asked my brother to lend me this person. It was he who came up with the plan, saying it could counter Wu Chuan and give him a warning."

After hearing this, Nangong Lin's expression was somewhat strange. He asked in surprise: "You mean it was this Nantian who came up with the plan?"

Nangong Lin was clearly surprised. He hadn't expected such a small bodyguard to have such a sharp mind. Also, he understood that someone who could come up with this plan wasn't just lucky but had a naturally sharp mind.

Chapter 556: Suspicion

After hearing Nangong Lin's question, Nangong Yayan nodded and said: "Yes, it was this Nantian."

"Are you sure you're not lying to me? It was really this bodyguard who came up with the plan?" Nangong Lin asked again.

Nangong Yayan nodded firmly, her expression very serious—she wouldn't lie to Nangong Lin.

"Alright, I know. You did well this time. Go rest a bit, and later the inland port's coordination will still rely on you," Nangong Lin said with a smile, then patted Nangong Yayan's shoulder to signal she could leave.

Nangong Yayan smiled and stood up, bidding Nangong Lin goodbye before leaving his villa. However, her expression was momentarily unreadable because she couldn't figure out what her father meant.

After Nangong Yayan left Nangong Lin's villa, Nangong Lin asked his butler: "What do you think about this?"

"Master, this bodyguard isn't simple. Coming up with such a plan wasn't accidental; it must mean his mind is naturally sharp," the butler replied.

"That's what people like Nangong Ping and others think—that this plan was just a coincidence. But everyone can see that someone who could come up with such a plan isn't ordinary. This Nantian's appearance is truly unexpected." Nangong Lin said, his expression somewhat dark because this Nantian's appearance had raised some doubts.

Although it wasn't a major issue for the Nangong family, this sudden appearance was somewhat suspicious. From his combat skills alone, he could defeat Zeng Chao and Zhang Yu—Nangong Lin knew that people with such combat skills were rare.

So a person like Nantian was truly uncommon, and according to what he said, he had lived in a small village all his life. Having such combat skills was astonishing. If it weren't for professional training from a young age, he wouldn't have such performance.

Moreover, his background was too clean—every detail he mentioned matched perfectly, which made it seem suspicious.

A person with such combat skills who had stayed in their small village for so long, only to appear now at the request of an old man to find the Nangong family—this was also suspicious.

Plus, considering the previous incident with the Haiwang Gang, the Nangong family had never severed ties with them. Yet this Nantian had completed the task in just a few days, which was definitely suspicious.

What method did he use to complete this task? No one could know.

Of course, Nangong Lin believed that if he had taken action himself, he could have resolved this issue. However, as the head of the Nangong family, there were more important matters on his hands. Therefore, he had always chosen to pay money and avoid arguments with the Haiwang Gang.

But this Nantian had solved the problem alone, which made him feel very suspicious. Even if his combat skills were excellent and he had defeated the entire Haiwang Gang, it was impossible to solve this issue solely through combat.

Then there was today's incident—this bodyguard had come up with such a brilliant plan, which made him feel quite terrifying. Not only was his physical strength and combat skills remarkable, but his mind was also clearly very sharp. At the very least, Nangong Lin could say that neither Nangong Yayan nor Nangong Ping could match his intelligence.

"You should send someone to investigate this Nantian's identity again. Previously, Nangong Ping said he had someone check the information and it all matched up. Now you should use our channels to investigate further, looking for any clues," Nangong Lin ultimately felt uneasy and told the butler this, hoping he would use their stronger resources to investigate Nantian.

"Yes, Master, I'll have someone go right away and get all the information by today," the butler said. But before he could leave, Nangong Lin raised his hand and said: "Now go get this Nantian here."

"Master, isn't it a bit too early to call him? This matter just ended. Why would you call him now, and what do you want to question him about?" The butler was somewhat against it and said this.

"It's not really a case of scaring him off. He has definitely been cautious towards me all along. Now that they've just returned from the inland port, this is when their minds are most relaxed and vulnerable. I can get some clues from his face by indirectly probing him. Moreover, I'm not going to punish him—I want to reward him."

Nangong Lin expressed his thoughts at this moment, and the butler was somewhat confused.

"You said you wanted to reward him?"

Nangong Lin nodded: "Yes, I want to reward him. Because he did this task very well. I plan to promote him. Since he did so well with the inland port, I'll have him take charge of it and see what kind of achievements he can make."

After Nangong Lin said this, he smiled. The butler, after hearing these words, looked as if he had understood and immediately said: "Master, wait a moment. I'll have someone go get him right away!"

After saying this, the butler left immediately.

At that moment, Su Nantian had just returned to Nangong Ping's villa for a short while. Nangong Ping asked him: "Why did you return so quickly? Was the handover that smooth?"

After Su Nantian explained the entire process to Nangong Ping, he heard footsteps outside and saw someone enter, saying to Nangong Ping: "Master Nangong, the master called for Nantian. There's something about today's inland port matter he wants to ask him."

Nangong Ping frowned upon hearing this. He knew his father had never had a good impression of Nantian, yet he was now calling him specifically. This must be something fishy.

"Alright, I understand. We'll go now." Nangong Ping replied as he meant to accompany Su Nantian.

But upon hearing Nangong Ping's reply, the person immediately said: "Master, the master said only for Nantian to come."

Chapter 557: The Hongmen Banquet

Upon hearing this, Nangong Ping felt even more puzzled. Although his father had called for Nantian, he thought it was fine to accompany him. However, the person specifically said only for Nantian to come, which clearly meant he didn't want Nangong Ping to go.

This reaction was very suspicious, proving that his father only wanted a private meeting with Nantian. But why had Nantian returned from the inland port so quickly? What had he done to anger his father, and why was he being called specifically without Nangong Ping?

"Alright, I understand. I'll tell him something before he goes," Nangong Ping said and waved his hand to signal the person could leave.

The person nodded and left.

"Have you offended your father recently?" Nangong Ping asked in confusion.

"No," Su Nantian felt puzzled as well. He didn't know if he had done something to anger Nangong Lin, which was why he was being called over. And now that the person had said only for Nantian to come, it was clearly sending him a message to avoid this conversation.

"Then why did your father call for you specifically? According to his usual behavior, he wouldn't have kept me from going. But this person said only for you to come, which is essentially conveying a message for me to step aside from this conversation." Although Nangong Ping was usually mediocre in other matters, he understood quite a bit about his relationship with Nangong Lin.

"I don't know," Su Nantian said, "I only went to the inland port with Miss today. After completing the task, I returned immediately. But if I haven't done anything wrong, my master calling me over shouldn't be to scold or trouble me." Su Nantian could only say this, and he had carefully reviewed his recent actions. He hadn't done anything wrong.

It was impossible to think that it was about the previous incident at Wu's family, or maybe Zeng Chao or Zhang Yu had said something to Nangong Lin.

"Anyway, it's no use guessing here. There's no need to worry. I'll go and see what happens. And since it's close, if anything happens, you can come visit me," Su Nantian said, though not clearly stating it. His meaning was clear: if he didn't return for a long time, Nangong Ping should go find Nangong Lin to save him.

"I understand. Go ahead with confidence," Nangong Ping said, patting Su Nantian's shoulder.

Su Nantian smiled and said: "Then Master, I'll go now. I can't let the master wait."

After saying this, Su Nantian walked towards Nangong Lin's villa.

Su Nantian met the butler again at the gate, but this person's expression showed no unusual signs. Upon seeing Su Nantian, he simply nodded and smiled slightly before saying: "The master is already waiting inside. Go in quickly."

Su Nantian nodded and smiled, then walked directly into the villa. He saw Nangong Lin still sitting on the sofa in the living room, reading a newspaper.

After entering, Su Nantian stood before Nangong Lin and said: "Master, I heard you called for me. I'm here now."

After a while, Nangong Lin put down his newspaper and removed his old glasses before saying: "I heard you did well with the inland port matter. I've already heard from Yayan. Today, your contribution was significant. This is a reward for you. Previously with the Haiwang Gang incident, you also did well—solving this thorn in our family's side for years. However, since you were punished to go there originally, I didn't reward you then.

But this time, it's definitely worth rewarding. I, Nangong Lin, have always been fair in rewards and punishments. So today I called you over to ask—what do you want?"

Upon hearing Nangong Lin's words, Su Nantian felt a sudden jolt in his heart. He knew he had entered the Hongmen Banquet, and Nangong Lin wouldn't have called him over just for a reward to demonstrate his fairness.

This was merely an excuse, and by bringing up these two matters together, he was essentially testing Su Nantian. These two tasks had been done too well, making him suspect who Su Nantian truly was.

Su Nantian suddenly felt a shock in his heart—regardless of the Haiwang Gang incident or today's inland port matter, he had done too much to stand out.

And since Nangong Yayan was Nangong Lin's daughter, she naturally reported the truth. Su Nantian hadn't expected that Nangong Yayan was so modest, not taking credit but instead attributing the plan to herself.

This was an unexpected event for Su Nantian, as he had calculated that after returning to report the matter, Nangong Yayan would naturally receive praise from Nangong Lin.

But she could have completely omitted mentioning him, attributing the plan directly to Nangong Yayan herself. And he wouldn't have any complaints, especially since he was merely a bodyguard borrowed from Nangong Ping. How could he expect to share the credit?

So Su Nantian's careful calculations had backfired, causing him to be suspected by Nangong Lin. Because now he thought about it, this plan was truly ingenious—not only did it allow them to complete the inland port handover but also lured Wu Chuan out and gave him a warning. It had achieved both face and substance for the Nangong family.

And this matter was why Nangong Yayan hadn't taken credit—because of her feelings for Su Nantian. She subconsciously felt she should tell Nangong Lin about all of Su Nantian's good deeds, not letting them be buried in a bodyguard position.

And Nangong Yayan knew that if Su Nantian remained just a bodyguard, even if she loved him, Nangong Lin would never agree to their marriage. Moreover, she knew that Nangong Lin had been holding back, waiting for an opportunity. If the Nangong family encountered any crisis in the future, she would be the first target for an economic marriage.

But if Su Nantian could rise to a position, with his mind, he might thrive. Then she could marry Su Nantian and ensure the Nangong family's assets wouldn't fall into outsiders' hands.

Chapter 558: Testing

Su Nantian knew that Nangong Lin had started to suspect him, but he also knew Nangong Lin's suspicion wasn't because he knew Su Nantian had come to the Nangong family as a spy for the Wu family.

Nangong Lin's suspicion was about what Su Nantian truly intended to do for the Nangong family. In Nangong Lin's view, Su Nantian's current performance proved he was definitely not just a simple bodyguard.

"How about it? Think carefully. This time, you've contributed so much to the Nangong family. What reward do you want?" Nangong Lin said with a smile, his eyes watching Su Nantian closely as if trying to read him.

This question was clearly a test for Su Nantian. He knew he had no specific demands, but if he said he didn't want anything, it would raise more suspicion. After all, he was just a bodyguard earning a salary from the Nangong family—how could he not want anything?

So Su Nantian pretended to be thinking, and after a while, he said: "After thinking it over, I suppose what I want most is money. If my salary could be increased a bit each month, that would be great."

After Su Nantian said this, he could clearly feel Nangong Lin's surprise. Nangong Lin had expected Su Nantian to not make specific demands, thinking he would say he didn't need any reward. But instead, Su Nantian had actually asked for something—money, the most mundane thing.

"Alright, I accept it," Nangong Lin could only nod and say this with a smile. After all, he was the one who had asked Su Nantian what reward he wanted. If Su Nantian had made this request, and he didn't accept it, he would seem stingy.

Mainly, Nangong Lin hadn't expected Su Nantian to actually want money. Had his intuition been wrong, or had he overestimated Su Nantian, thinking he came to the Nangong family for something else?

It was undeniable that Su Nantian's move had left Nangong Lin confused.

From the expression on Nangong Lin's face, Su Nantian could tell he had managed to pass this test.

"Alright, we've discussed the reward issue. Now let's talk about another matter," Nangong Lin continued with a smile, having just thought that this alone wasn't enough to confirm anything. If he truly wanted to confirm whether Su Nantian was a spy for the Nangong family, there were other methods.

"What else does the master need from me? If it's something I can do, I'll definitely try my best," Su Nantian replied respectfully.

"Today's performance at the inland port was outstanding. Yayan has already told me about it. This plan was yours, and I think this strategy is quite good. It seems you're not only skilled in combat but also sharp-minded. Now, it's a time when the Nangong family needs people. You know we've taken over the inland port from the Wu family, and we need to cultivate our own people to manage it. Although we only have a year, the goal is to maximize the profits from this inland port."

After saying this, Nangong Lin suddenly sighed and got up from the sofa. As he walked, he said: "But the Nangong family currently has a shortage of people. We lack talents like you who are both brave and wise. That's why we've always used the Tian Shui Building method to select talent for our family."

Su Nantian could tell that Nangong Lin's words were mixed with truth and falsehood, as a test. But he believed the Nangong family did need talent, otherwise they wouldn't have run the Tian Shui Building for so long to select people.

But Su Nantian definitely didn't believe the Nangong family was so short of talent that they had to rely on this method. A bodyguard like himself certainly wasn't significant enough to be considered for Nangong Lin's favor.

So Nangong Lin saying the family was so short of talent that it had become scarce was clearly incorrect.

"Since this period, Nangong Ping has been injured and I think it's better for him to rest at home. Once he's there, you won't need to protect him as much. So why don't you go ahead and take the lead at the inland port? The people there are all strong workers. If any conflict arises, your combat skills can directly suppress them. What do you think?"

Su Nantian was surprised upon hearing this, not expecting Nangong Lin to want him to go to the inland port.

But after thinking it over, Su Nantian understood. After all, the inland port was only under the Nangong family's control for a year. They couldn't expect to keep it permanently, and he going there was also thinking that if any conflict arose, his combat skills would allow him to stand firm there.

But this move could also be used to check if he truly had any hidden agenda, and if he was a spy in the Nangong family, he would use this time to distance himself from the Nangong family and help others pass information.

Su Nantian merely furrowed his brow and said: "I think it's not a wise choice for the master to send me to manage the inland port. I can't bear such responsibility."

"Have a little confidence in yourself. Your strategy today was perfect. If you can maintain this performance, managing an inland port should be more than enough for you," Nangong Lin said with a smile, his expression carrying a hint of cunning.

Su Nantian quickly waved his hands and said: "The master doesn't know, this plan wasn't my idea."

"Oh?" Nangong Lin was surprised. Did Su Nantian have someone else behind him? If there was, wouldn't it affect their cooperation?

"Only you were with Yayan. The rest were all her bodyguards. And she said this plan was your idea. Did someone foresee this situation and tell you the strategy in advance?"

Nangong Lin didn't believe Su Nantian's claim that this plan wasn't his. He was more puzzled why Su Nantian didn't want to go to the inland port, but the more he doubted, the more he wanted Su Nantian to go.

Chapter 559: Assignment

Nangong Lin certainly didn't believe this plan wasn't Su Nantian's. He was more puzzled why Su Nantian didn't want to go to the inland port, but the more he doubted, the more he wanted Su Nantian to go.

Su Nantian scratched his head and said: "Have you ever seen debt collectors? When they come to collect debts, if the debtor has no money, their family usually hides. In our village, there are many such cases. One person had no money to pay and hadn't left in time to hide, so he hid at home. But the debt collectors locked all the doors, trapping him inside. Without their keys, he could only be trapped and eventually had to come out.

So I said this plan wasn't my idea because I've encountered similar situations before, which is why I came up with this plan."

Su Nantian said this to ease some of his suspicions.

But Su Nantian hadn't expected Nangong Lin to smile and say: "That's even more proof of your ability. Even if you hadn't learned before, you could have mastered it after some training. So I think sending you to the inland port is the best choice."
