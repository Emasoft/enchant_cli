The patrol officers, along with Tang Sanfeng and others, turned their gazes toward Su Nantian upon seeing him return with a foreigner. Their expressions bore confusion, unsure of his intentions.

At this moment, the white man finally regained composure. He angrily wrenched free from Su Nantian's grip, his face pale and revealing a pair of sharp fangs. Frenzied emotions stripped him of his composure, revealing his vampire form.

"Mr. Wang, is this how you treat guests? I have committed no violation; I entered legally with proper documentation. You cannot act this way!"

This foreigner, Wang Baizi (Fat Wang), recognized him. Seeing Su Nantian had captured him, Wang Baizi felt a twinge of unease. After all, as he said, China is an open nation; anyone with legal status and no criminal record may enter lawfully. Though this man was a vampire, he at least followed the rules.

"Ah... John, please wait. This must be a misunderstanding..." Su Nantian turned to him with an icy gaze, sending shivers through the veteran of the Dragon Group. "Do you not smell that bloodstained aura on him? He must have drunk human blood within 24 hours. I don't believe any legal means could achieve that! A misunderstanding? Where is the confusion? Legality and rules apply to ordinary people. This monster, merely for his bloodstained aura, deserves tenfold death! Even if this wasn't his doing, what then?"

Su Nantian's patience was remarkable; he had refrained from outright killing. In the past, he would have simply sliced him down without hesitation. Yet now, as a new member of the organization, he chose to explain.

Yet even as he spoke, his third eye's mark flared. A尺-long flying sword hovered in the air and slowly approached the vampire George.

"Shit!"

In George's terrified gaze, the sword moved leisurely yet unblockable through his forehead. The sensation of a cold blade piercing his brain brought him an unusual ecstasy before he instantly turned to ash, vanishing into the air.

Wang Baizi's face remained dark and uncertain. His fists clenched, unclenched, clenched again—repetitively.

He wished to stop Su Nantian's actions but felt an invisible pressure preventing any resistance. His face was as black as soot, his eyes filled with anger.

But what could he do? Su Nantian cared nothing for it.

Tang Sanfeng leaned against the wall, arms crossed. He had not participated in these matters but when Su Nantian killed George outright, his eyes held a flicker of joy and admiration. He understood Wang Baizi's anger—sometimes, even within tight organizations, there are parasites.

Wang Baizi may not have betrayed the organization's interests outright, but he had certainly turned a blind eye to corruption and accepted bribes. Tang Sanfeng despised such people; his style was ruthless, leaving no survivors. His strained relationship with the Dragon Group stemmed partly from this.

Meanwhile, the ordinary patrol officers watched Su Nantian unleash a flying sword to kill a vampire. Their eyes brimmed with envy and admiration—after all, who among the Chinese boys didn't dream of being a hero?

"Wow, Old Su is so powerful!"

"Yes! Did you see it? The legendary flying sword! If I had that ability, who would dare bother me?"

"Haha, you're dreaming. Everything's there in your dreams, just not this flying sword!"

At that moment, Su Nantian had become the embodiment of a master and strong warrior in their eyes. Their admiration was genuine.

Their称呼 had shifted from "Mr. Su" to "Old Su," revealing how high his prestige was among them.

In contrast, Wang Baizi's face remained dark and uncertain. He glanced at the vampire's ashes on the ground, then at Su Nantian's calm expression. His lips trembled slightly as he tried to say something but couldn't find the words.

Tang Sanfeng noticed Wang Baizi's hesitation and smirked. He had already deciphered the man's hidden thoughts.

There was no helping it—men like Wang Baizi, stationed outside the Dragon Group, had long lost their minds to power. Their youthful passion was gone.

Though Hancheng wasn't large, it had millions of residents inside and out. As the Dragon Group's overseer in Hancheng, Wang Baizi controlled everything within this region. Over time, he naturally developed other thoughts—using his power to gain benefits and give favors.

He may not have betrayed the organization or country's interests outright, but he certainly wasn't clean in details. This was evident from the vampire's few words.

A foreign dark creature so familiar with this Dragon Group overseer—Tang Sanfeng wouldn't believe there was no underhanded dealings.

Unfortunately, Su Nantian had acted too quickly to extract any valuable clues from the vampire. Otherwise, Wang Baizi would have been in deep trouble.

As Wang Baizi was lost in thought, Su Nantian glanced at him with a smirk: "Fat Wang, do you have something to say?"

"Oh... nothing in particular."

Hearing this, Wang Baizi shook his head vigorously. His fat face trembled, giving an amusing appearance.

Jokingly, he had just witnessed Su Nantian's ruthless methods. Even if he wanted to say something now, he would naturally swallow his words.

After all, "misfortune comes from speaking too much." If he said the wrong thing and accidentally provoked trouble, it would be like picking up a stone to hit himself. Wang Baizi had spent years in the underworld; he knew well that talking too much was dangerous.

"Hmph. You have nothing, but I do."

Su Nantian's face darkened and his voice rose: "The ancients said, 'Those not of our kind will always be different.' These foreign vampires dare to act recklessly on our territory, killing innocents. They must pay with blood. Do you agree?"

"Yes! Old Su is right, let them repay their debts with blood!"

Everyone except Wang Baizi answered in unison. Especially the patrol officers, who shouted and clenched their fists, ready for a fight.

Wang Baizi hesitated for a few seconds before biting his lip and asking: "Old Brother Su, do you think we should return to discuss a more careful plan?"

Before Su Nantian could respond, Tang Sanfeng interjected: "What's there to discuss? With Old Brother Su's ability, kill every vampire he finds. How simple! Do you have another idea?"

After saying this, he narrowed his eyes and stared at Wang Baizi. The latter's back hair stood on end as he waved his hands frantically: "I have no other ideas. Alright, let's do it as Old Brother Su said. Let's act now!"

With Wang Baizi's command, the patrol officers sprang into action. As members of the Dragon Group's outer circle, they controlled many resources. To gather information in and around Hancheng was effortless.

Chapter 283: Sweep

Not long after, intelligence began to trickle in—names of places like bars, nightclubs, and entertainment venues.

After all, vampires were proud and considered themselves noble dark beings. They demanded high standards of material life and feared sunlight, preferring to move at night. Thus, the most lively places at night were their inevitable haunts.

The Moonlight Nightclub in the north of the city was Su Nantian's first destination. Before entering, he sensed a heavy stench of blood in the area—at least twenty or thirty people had died here. It was definitely a vampire gathering place.

"Die!"

Su Nantian's eyes turned red as he rushed into the nightclub. Inside was an open dance floor with many people seeking entertainment.

His entrance made a loud noise, and the bouncers thought someone had come to cause trouble. Within ten seconds, ten or so rough guys stood before him.

The leader held a short knife and stepped forward: "Which gang are you from? State your name. We're under Hao's protection. Show some respect."

Su Nantian smirked without a word and rushed forward, striking each bouncer down with casual punches. He stepped on the man who had held the knife and asked: "Where's your boss? Let him know he's letting vampires massacre our people. I think he must be tired of living."

Before the man could answer, a white-haired foreigner in the dance floor suddenly turned pale and fled toward an emergency exit. He even threw two throwing knives to delay time.

"Ah, so you're a coward," Su Nantian said as he deflected the knives and chased after him. The onlookers in the hall hadn't realized what had happened.

Two men moved like hawks. Though the white-haired foreigner ran fast, he was still outmatched by Su Nantian's speed. He was kicked down like a dog.

Using the impact, he rolled several times to create distance before standing up and threatening: "You're not bad, but don't think your martial arts skills can kill me. I am a Baron of the Tungus Family. With your abilities, you're no match for me. Be wise and leave quickly."

"Ah, talking big," Su Nantian sneered: "You're just a small fry. Don't act tough here. I'll take your head now to mourn the Chinese people you've killed."

After saying this, Su Nantian channeled his power and leapt into the air. He delivered a powerful palm strike at the white-haired foreigner's head, and the force of his palm was like a sword breaking free. A faint sonic boom echoed.

"OMG! What is this!"

The white-haired foreigner, a minor vampire, had never seen such combat techniques. He was terrified and forgot to flee.

Boom!

With a loud explosion, sparks flew everywhere as the air surged. The white-haired foreigner was struck by Su Nantian's palm, spun several times in the air, and fell to the ground. He immediately spat out a mouthful of old blood.

Su Nantian approached him and said: "Remember, don't come back to China next time. Assuming you have a next life."

After saying this, he ignored the foreigner's begging eyes and killed him with a single sword strike. Again, no corpse remained—only ashes.

Then Su Nantian searched the nightclub but found no other vampires. He grabbed the bouncers and asked about the nightclub's owner. The man was certainly a local boss, possibly with clues.

The bouncer trembled and answered: "Our boss left two days ago. I don't know where he is."

At this moment, Wang Baizi and Tang Sanfeng finally arrived. Su Nantian signaled Tang Sanfeng that the battle was over and they should move to another location.

Wang Baizi smiled: "Old Brother Su, are you hurt?"

"Of course not. What can a minor vampire do to me?"

Su Nantian surveyed the bouncers: "Listen up. When your boss returns, tell him to run his business properly and not protect those cruel foreigners. If I find anything dirty here again, this place won't exist anymore."

Su Nantian's words were powerful. Tang Sanfeng saw the underlings trembling and smiled, knowing this was what Su Nantian wanted. Sometimes, punishing a chicken to scare the monkeys was necessary.

Wang Baizi's eyes showed some worry. As Hancheng's overseer, he naturally knew the foreign forces' power here was immense; otherwise, he wouldn't have requested help from headquarters.

Now it seemed Su Nantian's arrival would change everything. His bold actions against the vampires frightened the foreigners, and when they stirred up trouble, it would surely bring a storm of bloodshed.

Next, Su Nantian turned to Wang Baizi: "Fat Wang, where's the next place?"

Hearing this, Wang Baizi checked his phone and quickly answered: "Oh, it's the Changning Hot Spring in Wufeng Street. There have been similar incidents there."

"Wufeng Street? That's not far from here. You're too slow; don't follow us. I'll go alone."

After saying this, Su Nantian vanished like lightning, leaving the crowd behind. Wang Baizi and Tang Sanfeng led the patrol officers away.

As they left, people began to gossip, but it had nothing to do with Su Nantian.

With sufficient intelligence sources, Su Nantian's sweep was proceeding smoothly. In just an hour, he had inspected every possible vampire location in Hancheng and killed a few. However, the results were minimal—only minor figures.

Among those swept, the strongest was a newly promoted count. The rest were all barons, and they were all members of the Tungus Family—this was interesting.

After inspecting those places, Su Nantian returned to meet Tang Sanfeng and Wang Baizi. He raised the question: "Do you know about the Tungus Family among vampires? These vampires who came to Hancheng are all from this family. It seems they have a large number."

"The Tungus Family? That's a big deal,"

Compared to Wang Baizi's limited knowledge, Tang Sanfeng, who had long been in the Dragon Group headquarters, knew more. He explained the Tungus Family's background.

Chapter 284: Clues

According to his account, foreign vampire forces were numerous and divided into hundreds of factions. However, the top thirteen bloodlines were known as the Thirteen Holy Clans. The Tungus Family was one of them, ranking quite high.

After Tang Sanfeng's explanation, Su Nantian sneered: "Hmph. Thirteen Holy Clans? They're worthy of the title 'holy'?"

After all, in China's ancient traditions, those who could be associated with "saint" were all great masters with supernatural abilities. These vampire families were only average among dark beings and dared to call themselves holy clans—how laughable. They must be ignorant, not knowing their place.

"Ha ha, Old Brother Su, these foreign barbarians are always arrogant. They just want to flatter themselves. It's understandable," Wang Baizi smiled and nodded.

There was no choice but to lower his head now that Su Nantian was the leader. He couldn't help but be submissive.

"By the way, Fat Wang, have you heard of a place called Black Mist Manor?"

This name was obtained from the vampire count Su Nantian had interrogated. Unfortunately, the man only knew of this place but hadn't been there himself. Fortunately, Wang Baizi was a local expert and should be able to find the exact location.

"Black Mist Manor?"

Wang Baizi was stunned, tilting his head for a few seconds. His tone was uncertain: "I think it's an abandoned manor in the eastern suburbs of Hancheng. It's said to be haunted, and no one dares go there. Why are you asking?"

"I heard this from a vampire," Su Nantian summarized the interrogation details. Tang Sanfeng thoughtfully said: "Old Wang, when we arrived, you mentioned these vampires came to Hancheng openly for a so-called holy object. I didn't misunderstand, did I?"

"Yes, that's right."

Wang Baizi didn't understand Tang Sanfeng's meaning and nodded honestly: "It's in the Hancheng Museum. I've already strengthened security; it won't be a problem."

"You didn't understand my meaning," Tang Sanfeng slowly explained: "I mean, since they're looking for a holy object of the vampire clan, it's unlikely that only these minor figures came. Without some strong leaders to back them up, how could they take the object out of China?"

"Right, Old Tang, your idea is very good."

Su Nantian nodded in agreement: "So I suspect the Tungus Family has other members hiding in Hancheng. Black Mist Manor might be their hideout. After all, it's remote and safe. Even counts aren't allowed there. It must be hiding some big fish."

"What are we waiting for? Let's go now!"

Hearing this, Tang Sanfeng was eager to fight. Su Nantian had acted too quickly before, and he hadn't gotten a chance to fight yet. Now that there was a clear clue, he couldn't help but be excited.

"Alright, let's finish it quickly and prevent them from reacting."

Su Nantian made the decision: "Fat Wang, we're not familiar with the outskirts of Hancheng. You'll lead the way this time. The others don't need to come. We're facing vampire masters, and having too many people is useless."

"Ah, I... I also need to go?"

Wang Baizi was startled by Su Nantian's words. Honestly, he didn't want to lead the way.

He had self-awareness; years of comfortable living had worn away his martial arts skills. His current physique made even a lazy donkey roll difficult, let alone fight with vampire masters. It was like risking his life.

"You don't go, how will we find the way?"

Seeing Wang Baizi's hesitation, Tang Sanfeng shut his escape route: "Besides, you're the head of Hancheng's patrol office. If you don't dare to risk your life, how can you expect your subordinates? If this gets out, it'll be hard to explain to the headquarters."

"This... okay, I'll go."

Tang Sanfeng's words were ruthless, pushing people to their deaths. Wang Baizi hesitated for a few seconds but finally agreed, saying he would go.

"Ah, Fat Wang, you don't need to look so dead," Tang Sanfeng saw Wang Baizi almost crying and changed his tone: "Look at Old Brother Su's skills. He can control flying swords to kill enemies. Maybe when we get there, he'll just slice the whole manor into pieces without needing us to fight. What's there to fear?"

"Yes, we all rely on Old Brother Su."

Wang Baizi trembled as he took out a handkerchief from his pocket, wiping the sweat off his forehead. Then he had his subordinates bring a jeep and drove it towards the Black Mist Manor in the eastern suburbs.

On the way, Wang Baizi briefly introduced the manor's background. It was a place built by a returned overseas Chinese with great investment, originally intended for family leisure and retirement.

But after it was built, there were frequent reports of haunted incidents, scaring the family away. Over time, no one dared to go there again, and the manor had been abandoned for decades. It was famous as a haunted house.

"Hmm, interesting."

After hearing Wang Baizi's fragmented description, Su Nantian and Tang Sanfeng exchanged glances. Both felt they had found the right place.

To ordinary people, this place was haunted and had various supernatural events. But to dark beings like vampires, it was an ideal habitat. They were ghosts themselves; what did they fear?

Su Nantian believed that if he killed the vampires hiding in Black Mist Manor, it would take a while for the Tungus Family to send another group of elite members. Hancheng would be safe for a while, and his first mission would be completed.

It must be said that Wang Baizi was timid but had excellent driving skills. He drove the jeep smoothly, and no one felt any bumps. After about half an hour, the car stopped in front of a dense forest.

Wang Baizi parked the car and turned to Su Nantian: "Old Brother Su, there's no road ahead. To get to Black Mist Manor, we have to go through this dense forest. The car can't enter. We must walk."

Chapter 285: Unlucky Wang Baizi

"Okay, let's go."

Su Nantian nodded slightly and didn't care much. After all, this place had been abandoned for decades. Few people dared to come here, and the roads built before were overgrown with weeds and trees. Of course, the car couldn't enter.

Actually, if he wanted to save time, he could have sliced through the forest with a sword and made a road. But he thought it was inappropriate.

This period had been plagued by vampire attacks, and the ordinary people of Hancheng were scared. If this haunted place caused more commotion, it would scare the people inside and outside the city to flee. He wouldn't do that.

After all, he was now a member of the Dragon Group and had to set an example. He couldn't scare the people for his convenience.

Then, under Wang Baizi's guidance, Su Nantian and Tang Sanfeng walked slowly into the forest path.

Tang Sanfeng took out his phone to confirm the exact coordinates but found it had no signal.

"Strange."

He muttered and hit his phone, but it was useless. Wang Baizi reminded him: "Old Tang, don't waste your time. The magnetic field here is strange. All electronic devices are interfered with. Even if you smash your phone, it won't have a signal."

"Ah, that's why it's haunted," Tang Sanfeng shrugged and put the phone back in his pocket. He looked around, his face was serious: "No wonder it's haunted. Even without real ghosts inside, the magnetic field here would cause hallucinations and affect people's mental states."

"Because of that, no one wants to come here. Oh, it's raining,"

Wang Baizi said while feeling raindrops on his head and hurriedly walked forward.

The rain wasn't heavy, and with the dense trees covering it, the three of them weren't really wet.

"Wait, there's something,"

Su Nantian had sharp senses and suddenly heard some movement. It seemed something was moving in the forest, sliding through the tall bushes, and the trees were shaking.

"Hey, what's wrong? Is there really a ghost here?"

Seeing Su Nantian's serious expression, Wang Baizi was scared and almost turned to run.

As the saying goes, the older one gets, the more timid they become. That's what he was like.

After living comfortably in Hancheng, he had long lost his former courage and heroism. Any small movement could scare him half to death, leaving no combat power at all.

Tang Sanfeng shook his head helplessly. He should have known better not to bring this man along. If they fought with the vampires later, he wouldn't help but be a burden—truly life-threatening.

Su Nantian listened for several seconds and gave an extremely definite answer: "Not a ghost. It's the sound of bees!"

"Hey, I thought it was wind sounds. What's there to be afraid of?"

Hearing this, Wang Baizi relaxed and patted his fat chest: "Old Brother Su, you're too sensitive. This is a forest after all. When the wind blows, it will hit the branches and leaves. Strange sounds are normal here."

"Fat Wang, you didn't understand my words,"

Compared to Wang Baizi's relaxed demeanor, Su Nantian remained tense: "Not the wind. It's bees! This thing might be more dangerous than bees. The sound it makes in the forest must mean there are many of them. Be careful, don't get stung."

"Are you saying there are venomous bees here?"

At this moment, Wang Baizi's mood was like a roller coaster—up to the clouds and then down into the valley. It was too exciting.

Tang Sanfeng saw him scared and patted his shoulder: "Don't worry, Fat Wang. I'm here."

"Oh right, you're from the Tangmen (Tang Clan), and you're good at traps and poisons. I'm sure you can drive away the venomous bees,"

Wang Baizi's mind was quick. After hearing Tang Sanfeng's words, he immediately realized this man was a master from the Tang Clan. Using poison to counteract poison was his specialty. With Tang Sanfeng here, how could he fear a few small bees?

"Here, this is the latest Tangmen insect-repelling spray. Spray it on your body and various snakes, insects, and mice will avoid you."

Tang Sanfeng said this while taking out a lipstick-sized spray bottle and sprayed it on the three of them. Su Nantian smelled a pungent odor, which must be the scent that repelled insects.

"Ah, Old Tang, don't be so stingy. Spray a few more times. I'm such a big person; this little bit isn't enough."

Wang Baizi thought Tang Sanfeng had sprayed too little and grabbed the spray bottle, spraying it on himself three or five times before feeling a bit of security.

"Don't waste it. This stuff is expensive. I only brought a small bottle this time, and after using it, I have to go back to the Tangmen for more."

Tang Sanfeng's eyebrows twitched, and he was心疼 (heartfelt). He snatched the bottle back and carefully put it back in his pocket, no longer letting Wang Baizi waste it.

Then he thought for a moment and added: "I told you, this insect-repelling spray can only repel insects passively. If you actively provoke them, you still need to find a way to escape or kill them. Got it?"

Wang Baizi nodded and replied softly: "Alright, I understand. I'll be careful walking and not cause trouble."

This man had some self-awareness, knowing Tang Sanfeng's words were a warning. After all, with Su Nantian's combat skills, it was hard for venomous bees to catch up. Why fear them?

Buzz!

At this moment, a dense sound of breaking air came from the front forest. It seemed the bees Su Nantian had heard earlier had arrived here.

"Mom, run!"

Wang Baizi made a quick decision and did a lazy donkey roll. He didn't notice the thorny bushes beside him and rolled over them.

Seeing this, Su Nantian cleanly swung a sword to clear the bees ahead. Wang Baizi's noise was too loud; if he had really provoked the bees, it would have been a problem.

"My god, Fat Wang, are you okay?"

Tang Sanfeng ran two steps and pulled Wang Baizi up. Wang Baizi's clothes were torn by the thorns, becoming strips of cloth. His body was covered with scratches, occasionally bleeding—too pitiful.

After regaining his composure, Wang Baizi immediately asked: "Venomous bees?"

Tang Sanfeng rolled his eyes: "Old Brother Su killed them with one sword. Can you walk?"

"Yes, I can."

Wang Baizi was about to cry. He had truly lost out this time. If only he had been braver, it was his own fault for being too scared.

Chapter 286: Greed Leads to Death

After this misunderstanding, the three of them continued smoothly. Under Wang Baizi's guidance, they soon arrived at Black Mist Manor.

But now, the Black Mist Manor looked unusual. The entire manor was surrounded by a strange black mist, making it impossible to see inside—truly fitting its name.

Su Nantian tried to use his spiritual sense to probe ahead but was blocked by the black mist. He couldn't penetrate it.

He frowned and asked Wang Baizi: "Fat Wang, was this manor like this before?"

"Of course not."

Wang Baizi shook his head vigorously. His facial fat trembled: "In my memory, this was just an ordinary abandoned mansion. It was in disrepair with weeds everywhere. There were no black mists outside."

"Before, it might not have been, but after a group of sneaky vampires came here, anything is normal. Let's go in and see."

Tang Sanfeng wasn't afraid of these supernatural things at all. He led the way forward, and Su Nantian raised his eyebrows and followed behind. The one who was cautious was Wang Baizi.

The three of them arrived at the manor's gate and looked inside. The main door was open, revealing a large courtyard like Wang Baizi said—seemingly abandoned for years.

However, there were some strange places. The courtyard was filled with many stone statues placed haphazardly without any pattern. In the center stood a black pillar. Due to the darkness and the surrounding mist, it was hard to see what the column looked like.

Tang Sanfeng stood at the gate and thought for a while before suddenly realizing: "Huh, it's an enchantment array. No wonder it created such a large black mist."

"What is an enchantment array?"

This term was clearly Western, and Su Nantian hadn't seen it before. He asked casually.

Tang Sanfeng explained: "Well, the Western enchantment array is equivalent to our Eastern arrays. Compared to arrays, it's easier to set up and doesn't have as much power. Its strange aspects are better, so be careful."

"Understood. Let's continue forward. If I'm not mistaken, the core of this enchantment array should be there."

Su Nantian pointed to the black pillar in the center. Unlike other places, he felt something was wrong with this column.

"What are we waiting for? Let's go!"

Tang Sanfeng was worried about the longer time, wanting to finish these vampires quickly. He grabbed Su Nantian and headed toward where he said, but Su Nantian felt it wasn't that simple. Something was watching him from a corner.

While being pulled by Tang Sanfeng, Su Nantian constantly observed the surrounding areas. The front courtyard was vast with many stone statues that looked like decorations.

These statues were old, with many covered in moss. They appeared as terrifying warriors holding sharp swords and weapons, looking fierce.

As they passed by, the ground was littered with gold, silver, and jade—valuable items. To Tang Sanfeng, these weren't important; they were official members of the Dragon Group and didn't need this small amount. He continued pulling Su Nantian toward the pillar.

"Old Brother Su, you're experienced. How can we break this enchantment array? Otherwise, we won't be able to enter the main gate."

Tang Sanfeng and Su Nantian reached the black pillar. Looking at this three-meter-diameter column, they couldn't see its top. It seemed to support the entire Black Mist Manor.

The thick column was intricately carved with a strange beast resembling a lizard. It had four wings, a spiral horn on its head, and fiery mane around its neck, roaring into the sky with fierce majesty.

Su Nantian stared at it for a long time but couldn't recognize what it was. He felt a bit dazed.

"Old Brother Su, I asked you a question."

Tang Sanfeng was clearly anxious. Seeing Su Nantian didn't answer, he became impatient. "It's just a broken pillar. What's so interesting? Once we complete the mission and eliminate the hidden vampires, there will be time to look at it."

"I know you're in a hurry, but I've never seen this Western enchantment array before. If we accidentally touch the surrounding traps, it might cost us our lives."

Su Nantian wasn't in a hurry. He explained his thoughts: "Look at the beast on this pillar and the surrounding statues. I always feel they're watching us. Be careful when walking, don't touch any of them."

Hearing this, Tang Sanfeng's impatience had to subside. He calmly turned to Su Nantian.

"You're right, Old Brother Su. I was too hasty. Everything here is unknown. We can't rush. Whatever you say, we'll do it your way. I'll listen to you."

"Old Brother Tang, now everyone is on the same boat. I can't let you get into trouble here."

Su Nantian's eyes flashed with determination.

"Yes, continue. I was too hasty."

Tang Sanfeng nodded slightly and sat down by the side. Su Nantian continuously scanned the surroundings, observing them with his spiritual sense again and again.

He gradually noticed something. The eyes of the strange beast on the pillar looked alive, staring at them creepily. To break the enchantment array, this must be the key.
