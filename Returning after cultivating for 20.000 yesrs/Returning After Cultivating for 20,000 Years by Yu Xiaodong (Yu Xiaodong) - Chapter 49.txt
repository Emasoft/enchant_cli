"Yang Yan, my Qinnan Tian is most suitable for me. If you can't speak properly, don't say things people dislike. Is this what you call depth?" Wu Lianxing said, her expression unamused.

Yang Yan's face flickered with embarrassment. He hurriedly explained to Wu Lianxing, "No, I didn't mean that. I just think Su Nantian, a shallow person, isn't worthy of your zither. Look."

Yang Yan lifted the black cloth covering the long zither, revealing a three-foot-five-inch obsidian zither that immediately caught everyone's attention. Though not as dazzling as Wu Lianxing's ancient zither, it was still an impressive jade zither.

Yang Yan smiled with pride and confidence. "This zither I've been crafting for years. The entire body is made of obsidian, and the strings are soft gold forged through countless hammerings. I did it to match your zither, Lianxing..."

A tender call filled the air but made Wu Lianxing and Su Nantian frown.

"A fine obsidian zither," Su Nantian said coldly, his gaze at the zither dangerous. "This zither does match Lianxing's somewhat, though it lacks history, its appearance is perfect."

Hearing Su Nantian's praise, Yang Yan's expression grew even more proud.

"Are you afraid? Your zither in your hands would never produce anything remarkable. You'd waste it. Through today's competition, I hope you realize some things are beyond your rural talent!"

Though Wu Lianxing's face was unpleased, Su Nantian's compliment was genuine. Despite Yang Yan's poor character, his specially crafted obsidian zither was truly perfect, even making her glance at it involuntarily.

"Since we've both brought out such fine zithers, let's add a bet to the competition," Su Nantian said, stroking the zither on the stand.

"Bet?" Yang Yan's eyes flickered with confusion but then he saw Wu Lianxing's handsome face. He gritted his teeth, "So be it. But what exactly is this bet?"

Su Nantian's lips curled into a confident smile, which Yang Yan disliked intensely.

"If I win," Su Nantian pointed at the black zither before Yang Yan, "this zither will be mine."

Yang Yan's heart jolted. He snorted, "What makes you think so? Lianxing letting you touch her zither is already enough for you. Now you want my jade zither? Don't you think that's too much?"

"Whether I think too much is my problem. Now, I ask you—dare you bet on it?" Su Nantian raised an eyebrow.

Though Yang Yan was reluctant, he reassured himself: "Su Nantian's skills are inferior."

Plus the gaze of Wu Lianxing below, Yang Yan finally bit his lip and nodded. "What's there to be afraid of? I'm sure you can't beat me. But if you lose, I want you to kneel and apologize!"

Yang Yan cast a scornful glance at Su Nantian, causing the crowd to gasp.

"Did I hear right? Yang Yan wants Su Nantian to kneel and apologize?"

"No, no way. That's too arrogant."

Even Gao Jingjing, usually gentle, was getting impatient. But with the competition at hand, any bet both parties agreed to wasn't excessive. Gao Jingjing guessed that someone as proud as Su Nantian would never back down from such a bet.

Indeed, after hearing Yang Yan's words, Su Nantian merely raised an eyebrow in slight surprise before agreeing. "Fine, but I think you're talking nonsense. There won't be such a scene."

Su Nantian pointed at his head, "Such a scene would only appear in your mind."

"Stop talking nonsense!" Yang Yan angrily waved his hand, already eager to sit at the zither stand. Yang Yan plucked a string, producing a clear and piercing sound matching Wu Lianxing's zither.

This made Su Nantian even more confident in his victory.

The two competitors were ready, and the competition was about to begin. Su Nantian slowly adjusted his posture and extended a hand toward Yang Yan, "You go first."

Unexpectedly, this gentleman's gesture seemed to Yang Yan like a sign of retreat. He sneered and chuckled, then composed himself into the posture to play.

It was undeniable that Yang Yan's accumulated anger after meeting Wu Lianxing surged forth, but before the zither he was as composed as a true gentleman.

This demeanor of Yang Yan instantly won over most of the girls present.

"Wow, look at Yang Yan. He's already handsome, and this quiet demeanor before the zither makes him even more so. There's an indescribable charm."

"That's right, otherwise how could he be the top student of the music department?"

Most girls came to watch the competition just for a glimpse of these two boys' charm. The current discussion was naturally expected.

"Quiet down, the competition is about to start," Wu Lianxing couldn't tolerate any noise in front of her zither, so she reminded the people behind to be quiet. This action seemed tender to Yang Yan's eyes.

Refusing to accept Yang Yan's gentle gaze, Wu Lianxing felt a slight twitch on her lips. She hadn't expected Yang Yan to misunderstand so much. If she had known, she would have ignored this matter.

Yang Yan's mood was excellent; facing the zither he even wore a smile, more like a charming and elegant gentleman.

He placed his hands on the seven strings. He took a deep breath, steadied his emotions, and his long fingers moved smoothly across the seven strings, playing a heart-stirring melody.

Yang Yan's choice of "Feng Qiu Huang" (Phoenix Seeks the Phoenix) made most girls' hearts race, as if Yang Yan was playing this beautiful music for them.

His long fingers continuously plucked the strings, as if two phoenixes rose from his back, chasing and playing in the air.

Even Su Nantian sat nearby, closing his eyes to listen carefully. He occasionally furrowed his brows or curled his lips, as if he had found many mistakes in Yang Yan's performance.

No one could resist the sound of Yang Yan's zither. No one could read Su Nantian's expression, but Wu Lianxing understood that with Su Nantian's expressions, she occasionally smiled.

After the piece ended, most girls were lost in Yang Yan's gentle zither music. It felt as if Yang Yan had painted a beautiful scene of "Feng Qiu Huang" for them, making people yearn for it.

Chapter 233: Feng Qiu Huang

Yang Yan looked at the audience's reaction with satisfaction. But when he turned his gaze to Wu Lianxing, he felt a touch of melancholy. Wu Lianxing remained expressionless, staring ahead without any emotional reaction to Yang Yan's performance, not even a slight change in expression.

He clenched his fists, his nails digging into his skin. Yang Yan then slowly released his hands.

"How is it? My zither skills in this room, besides Lianxing, no one else can match?" Yang Yan looked at Su Nantian with disdain, as if the situation was already decided.

"From a certain perspective, I quite like confident people. But what I dislike most is someone more confident than me," Su Nantian said with a sigh, dismissing Yang Yan's provocation.

"Originally wanted to play another piece. Since you played 'Feng Qiu Huang,' I'll play it too," Su Nantian lazily lifted his eyelids, seeing Wu Lianxing below. Their eyes met in a smile, making Yang Yan even more gloomy.

Su Nantian casually sat at the zither stand. His long, pale fingers lightly rested on the seven strings. He closed his eyes and thought for a second. As his fingers danced, waves of trembling sound seemed to scatter countless pearls into a jade plate—clear and bright, yet like someone whispering close by, tenderly heart-wrenching.

Unlike Yang Yan's performance, Su Nantian's "Feng Qiu Huang" carried more depth and less urgency. It was like a pair of lovers whispering tenderly, truly embodying the essence of "Feng Qiu Huang."

Everyone was astonished. Yang Yan's eyes widened, unable to believe Su Nantian could play such an accomplished piece. But the music now pouring into his ears snapped him back to reality.

This was Wu Lianxing's second time hearing Su Nantian's zither skills. This gentle "Feng Qiu Huang" felt like a caress from Su Nantian, moving Wu Lianxing and Gao Jingjing deeply.

Cao Yun's eyes shone brighter. She gazed at Su Nantian on stage, listening to the "Feng Qiu Huang" melody. A tear fell from her eyes, startled by the moist touch. She quickly lowered her head to wipe away this complex emotion.

Su Nantian's fingers danced over the seven strings of the jade zither, creating a trembling sound that gave the long zither an added sense of vitality. Su Nantian was also somewhat surprised; this zither resonated with him, a rare phenomenon unless it possessed great spiritual power.

After being buried underground for centuries without seeing the light of day, this zither had awakened again upon meeting Su Nantian, a master of such art. It seemed to come back to life from an inanimate object.

After the piece ended, the audience was speechless. After a brief silence, the room erupted with unprecedented fervent applause.

Su Nantian smiled and nodded to the audience below. Everyone clapped with different thoughts stirred by this piece of music, their applause lasting endlessly until some people's palms were red from clapping.

"You..." Yang Yan recovered from his shock, pointing at Su Nantian in disbelief. "You could play such a piece... why!"

Yang Yan seemed unable to accept it, frowning and shaking his head as if trying to wake up from this dream.

Cao Yun also exclaimed, "I never imagined Su Nantian was such a versatile talent. No matter what he does, it's so outstanding. It surprises me deeply."

Instantly, all the girls turned their attention to Su Nantian, their admiration for Yang Yan now even more intense.

Students outside the music room who had been peeking through the window rushed in eagerly. Many students drawn by Su Nantian's zither melody also entered the room with surprised expressions.

Even a music department "tone-deaf" senior, who had heard Su Nantian's melody from the adjacent room, immediately dropped what he was doing and rushed in.

"Who played that zither?" The tone-deaf senior adjusted his glasses, his surprised gaze scanning everyone in the room before finally landing on Su Nantian and Yang Yan.

The tone-deaf senior's eyes lit up. He rushed to the stage, scrutinizing Yang Yan before saying, "Good job, haven't seen you in a while. Your performance of 'Feng Qiu Huang' was truly amazing! I even got lost in it. Do you know what it feels like to have every note perfectly executed? It's震撼ing!"

Yang Yan pursed his lips, not yet able to explain. The tone-deaf senior then saw the black zither before Yang Yan, his eyes shining even more. He extended a trembling hand to touch the zither's body and exclaimed, "This zither you made is truly good. No wonder it can produce such a beautiful melody. It matches your current level."

"You should take good care of this zither. Anyone who sees it would be envious," the tone-deaf senior said, reluctant to look away, as if each glance would make him even more unwilling to part.

Yang Yan's face darkened further, showing no signs of joy. The tone-deaf senior was puzzled. At this moment, Wu Lianxing slowly walked up and interjected between the two: "Senior, you've misunderstood this time."

The tone-deaf senior was stunned and scratched his head in confusion. Wu Lianxing pointed at Su Nantian beside her, saying, "The zither music you heard just now was played by Su Nantian. It has nothing to do with Yang Yan."

"Also," Wu Lianxing touched the zither before Yang Yan, saying, "This zither will now belong to our Su Nantian."

The tone-deaf senior was only interested in music and didn't care about Wu Lianxing's reference to Su Nantian. After hearing Wu Lianxing's explanation, he suddenly understood and nodded, quickly directing his glowing gaze toward Su Nantian.

Su Nantian was wrapping the zither in a silk cloth, his movements extremely like those of a deity. Unfortunately, this deity showed no interest in the tone-deaf senior. Su Nantian completely ignored his gaze.

Seeing that Su Nantian had already packed the zither, Wu Lianxing hurried over and lifted it with both arms, carrying it to the safe. This world-renowned ancient zither was placed into a closed safe under everyone's watchful eyes. The tone-deaf senior missed his only chance to closely experience the ancient zither since he entered the room.

Chapter 234: Sensation

"Student?" The tone-deaf senior approached cautiously. "The zither music you played just now was yours?"

It wasn't strange for the tone-deaf senior to misidentify people. After all, Su Nantian's name had never appeared in the music department before, making it hard to learn about him.

Su Nantian merely lifted his eyelids and glanced at the person without answering the tone-deaf senior's question, as if he had automatically ignored it along with his previous gaze.

Su Nantian's temperament was well-known to Wu Lianxing, but she also had a good relationship with this tone-deaf senior. Seeing the senior being deliberately ignored, Wu Lianxing felt a bit reluctant.

At that moment, Wu Lianxing spoke for Su Nantian. "Yes, this is Su Nantian. Don't think his name sounds familiar, but he's truly a hidden talent. His zither skills are even better than mine."

"Yes," the tone-deaf senior nodded in agreement. "Your talent is rare, and even Master Fang took you as his disciple. But the performance I just heard made me feel that Su Nantian's level is even higher than yours."

Wu Lianxing didn't feel the slightest embarrassment at the tone-deaf senior's words. On the contrary, she felt proud of Su Nantian's overwhelming strength.

At this moment, the tone-deaf senior seemed to realize his mistake. He awkwardly cleared his throat and explained, "When I came in just now, I was drawn to Yang Yan's zither. I thought such a good zither could produce such beautiful music, so I overlooked Su Nantian. Forgive me."

After saying that, the tone-deaf senior bowed sincerely to Su Nantian.

Su Nantian, seeing his sincerity, nodded for the first time. "It's nothing."

After saying that, Su Nantian walked over to Yang Yan and waved his hand. The black cloth covering the zither was wrapped back on.

Yang Yan was startled and quickly reached out to protect his zither. His gaze at Su Nantian seemed to want to tear him apart.

Su Nantian frowned. "Now, are you going back on your word?"

That sentence completely deflated Yang Yan's arrogance. His hands gripping the zither slowly dropped down.

Su Nantian didn't even look at him again. He wrapped the black zither and took it.

This scene left the tone-deaf senior stunned, his face full of surprise as if Su Nantian was doing something like a thief.

"Wait!" The tone-deaf senior shouted. "How could you do this! Although your zither skills are exceptional, you're stealing someone else's zither. Even this world-renowned one... you..."

"Because he lost to me." Before the tone-deaf senior could finish, Su Nantian coldly interrupted. "The competition should have a bet, right?"

After saying that, Su Nantian didn't look at the tone-deaf senior's face alternating between red and green. He walked out of the music room on his own.

Yang Yan didn't argue with Su Nantian's words. He remained silent, gazing at Su Nantian with a dark expression. Today's humiliation he would definitely reclaim.

Su Nantian turned and left, while Wu Lianxing and Gao Jingjing followed closely behind.

One day had passed since Yang Yan and Su Nantian's competition, but the melody of "Feng Qiu Huang" played by Su Nantian had already become popular on campus.

Many music department students practiced "Feng Qiu Huang" based on the melody Su Nantian played. However, since Su Nantian didn't leave any video or audio recordings, the music department students could only rely on those present at the time to recount it.

But this recollection of the melody had some differences, and even in terms of technique, one line had three different versions.

Even so, Su Nantian's fame and achievements spread rapidly throughout the school.

With such a beautiful girl like Wu Lianxing by his side, and being both scholarly and martially skilled, Su Nantian quickly became a top figure on the campus's风云榜 (Wind and Cloud Rankings). Almost no one remained unaware of this new student.

Because of this fame, Su Nantian's romantic fortune also became increasingly prosperous.

After his military training, during lunch break arranged by the instructor, Su Nantian went to change clothes in the rest room. He found many pink letters in his locker. At first, Su Nantian was just curious and opened them to read.

The heartfelt declarations in the letters made Su Nantian shake his head.

At this moment, Su Nantian's phone rang. He took it out of his pocket and answered. A melodious female voice came from the other end: "Hello, is this Su Nantian?"

Su Nantian was stunned. He took the phone away to check the caller ID and said, "Lianxing."

Wu Lianxing chuckled. Her mood seemed very good as she asked, "I thought you'd have many people calling you during this time. You couldn't tell them apart."

"You have caller ID, fool," Su Nantian said while using his ear and shoulder to hold the phone. His hands were searching through the locker for clothes he needed to change into. "I'll come find you in the music department later. Meet me at the cafeteria."

After Wu Lianxing happily replied "Okay," Su Nantian hung up.

After changing clothes, Su Nantian looked at the unlocked locker and frowned slightly. He took out all the pink love letters from the locker and threw them into the trash behind him before leaving to find Wu Lianxing.

The small path of Fengyue University was built with such romantic charm, as if it were specifically designed for many couples to enjoy the beauty of spring.

As Su Nantian walked along this path, he subconsciously slowed his pace.

The fragrant scent of flowers drifted with the wind, lifting Su Nantian's mood.

This path led to the music department cafeteria and was a shortcut. Soon, Su Nantian stood at the entrance of the cafeteria. He walked through the revolving door and entered the cafeteria, where Wu Lianxing was already waiting for him.

"You're here," Wu Lianxing happily approached and smiled at Su Nantian. "I thought you'd be surrounded by beauty on the way and would take longer."

"Beauty?" Su Nantian suddenly thought of those letters. He said, "Is there a store nearby that sells electronic locks?"

Wu Lianxing was stunned. She nodded slightly, but her curiosity made her ask, "What do you need an electronic lock for? Did something get stolen?"

"You know," Su Nantian said casually, "they keep stuffing letters into my locker whenever they have time. It's a lot, and I don't want to clean them up."

Wu Lianxing covered her mouth and giggled, pretending to be a good person. "You can't do that. The girls wrote these letters with so much heart. How did you deal with them?"

Chapter 235: A Date

"Of course I threw them into the trash behind me. Do you think I'd take them back and secretly look at them in my bed?" After saying that, Su Nantian pushed open a glass door. This was a Western-style restaurant.

The two entered the restaurant, and almost everyone's eyes were drawn to them. The man was handsome beyond compare, and the woman was beautiful and graceful. More importantly, both were top figures on the school's rankings.

At that moment, many people took out their phones to secretly take photos. They were scared away by Su Nantian's cold gaze.

Wu Lianxing felt awkward. "Let's change restaurants."

But Su Nantian had already pulled out the chair for her and asked her to sit. "It's not a big deal. They won't take photos."

The cold attitude lowered the temperature of this restaurant slightly. These people naturally wouldn't dare to act improperly in front of Su Nantian, as they had heard about his strength. Even Yang Yan's reason for challenging Su Nantian was known.

Yang Yan's subordinates were beaten without a chance to fight back.

This strength made them不得不忌惮 (have to be wary of).

A rustling sound of people putting their phones away echoed through the restaurant. Soon, the environment returned to its original quietness.

A server carefully approached Su Nantian with a menu. His eyes flickered between Su Nantian and Wu Lianxing before finally handing the menu to Wu Lianxing.

"Thank you," Wu Lianxing took the menu and ordered two dishes, then another two soups. Su Nantian listened throughout without interrupting. After the server recorded it, he asked hesitantly: "What about this gentleman..."

"He's already ordered for me," Su Nantian said.

The server immediately felt relieved and hurriedly left with the menu.

Wu Lianxing smiled, "You scared her away."

"You just need to keep me company for dinner," Su Nantian smiled.

A second later, a female voice exclaimed behind them, as if discovering something important. She covered her mouth and stammered to her companion: "I remember!"

This voice was small but clear enough for those who listened carefully.

"I remember! Su Nantian once appeared on a show, he played the zither and was praised by Master Fang!"

At this moment, exclamations spread.

The companion looked at Su Nantian's direction with concern and asked, "Are you sure? Did you not wake up yet?"

"What do you mean I didn't wake up?" The girl was very dissatisfied with her companion's denial. She took out her phone and searched for "Su Nantian playing the zither." The first result was this TV show.

Everyone in the restaurant immediately took out their phones to search for this information.

Wu Lianxing smiled, "You see, your video was dug up."

Su Nantian shook his head without expression. He seemed insensitive to this trend of popularity, saying, "People fear fame, and pigs fear being fat. I really don't want to become popular in this school."

This would end his quiet life.

After they finished their meal, Wu Lianxing reluctantly parted with a lingering gaze. However, Su Nantian showed no reluctance at all. He and Wu Lianxing were only half-mentors, and Su Nantian had no feelings for her at all.

After all, there was already a wolf at home. Adding more would make him feel his body couldn't handle it.

After seeing off Wu Lianxing, Su Nantian took out his phone.

He lightly tapped on the name Zhang Xiaojun, and the words "dialing" appeared.

"Ding... Ding..."

After a few seconds, it was answered. Zhang Xiaojun's loud voice came from the other end: "Hey Tian Ge! What do you need?"

"Are you free today? Let's meet."

Zhang Xiaojun rubbed his head. He had already made plans with other brothers to eat, but he still replied without hesitation: "Of course I am. When does Tian Ge have time? I'll find you."

After saying that, he thought about how to explain this to his friends. He felt a bit guilty.

Su Nantian wrote words on the blanket with his fingers, saying, "No need for you to come. I heard that a bar in Xinlong Building is popular. Go there and find me later."

"Okay, Ge. You mean the bar called Feisi, right? I didn't expect Tian Ge to pay attention to such things." After saying that, Zhang Xiaojun smiled mischievously.

Su Nantian didn't want to argue with him. He hung up the phone with a "click." Zhang Xiaojun saw the display and smiled reluctantly. Although he had been with Su Nantian for a short time, he roughly understood his temper, so he wasn't worried about Su Nantian getting angry.

Zhang Xiaojun looked at his watch, took the clothes hanging on the rack, and shook off the dust before putting them on.

After all, Su Nantian was his benefactor, so he had to arrive early. Also, Zhang Xiaojun was a person who never forgot his roots. Even though Su Nantian had given him some authority, he didn't touch it.

Like clothes, beauty is good, but unnecessary.

Zhang Xiaojun took his hand again and picked up the keychain on the table. He walked out of the door in three steps, pushed the electric scooter under the door, and rode it. The car was an old model from years ago but clean, showing how much the owner cared for it.

"Beep beep," Zhang Xiaojun inserted the key into the hole. He sat on the seat and headed straight for the bar.

Zhang Xiaojun was unusually lucky today. The green light allowed him to reach the bar entrance smoothly.

The doorman of the bar had already mastered the dynamics of people entering this alley. Seeing him ride a motorcycle, he hesitated for a moment. After all, those who came to play were either rich or powerful; even driving a BMW was considered middle-class. Riding a motorcycle...

The doorman rubbed his hands and stretched his neck to look around, then hesitated for a while. He decided to go forward; it wouldn't cost him anything, and he wouldn't offend anyone.

With this mindset, he hurried to Zhang Xiaojun's side. Bending down, he said, "Hello, this vehicle... I'll take care of it."

Zhang Xiaojun was stunned. He looked down at the broken electric scooter he was pushing and then glanced around at the luxury cars. He smiled awkwardly, "I'll do it myself. Where should I park?"

Chapter 236: Martial Arts

The doorman said this, and immediately waved his hands. "That's not allowed. You came here to spend money; how could you have to park yourself? I'll do it. Just trust me." Saying that, the server respectfully took the handlebars from Zhang Xiaojun.

But this car was old. Besides Zhang Xiaojun, no one else could handle it. Even if others pushed it, it was very unbalanced. At that moment, the server pushed the car awkwardly and walked away.

Zhang Xiaojun crossed his arms behind him, looking at it with a conflicted and sorrowful expression.

"Hey, don't bump into me!" Zhang Xiaojun shouted loudly. He didn't know if the server heard him, but he didn't look back at Zhang Xiaojun again.

The luxury cars around were like they weren't worth anything. Zhang Xiaojun took a deep breath and thoughtfully rubbed his chin. He wandered around the luxury car parking lot, overwhelmed by the car logos.

"I'll just not change it," Zhang Xiaojun muttered. He took out his phone and opened Su Nantian's chat, pressed the voice message button: "Tian Ge, I'm here. I'll come in soon."

Feisi Bar was a bar established for less than three years. Su Nantian vaguely remembered that he had once come here during a celebration and left a good impression of the bar's service.

Afterward, whenever Su Nantian had something to handle, he would prioritize this bar. But after experiencing two thousand years in the immortal world, Su Nantian had almost forgotten these worldly matters.

Now that he remembered Feisi Bar again, a strong sense of nostalgia came over him.

Feisi Bar was different from others. It was a bar in the evening and a quiet bar during the day, with an hour of transition time. Otherwise, it was always open.

In a corner booth at the bar, Su Nantian had already finished his second glass of vodka.

Not to mention two glasses; even a bottle would not affect him at all. For Su Nantian, it was like two glasses of plain water, slightly flavored and tasty.

Even though the booth was in a corner of the bar, many women were whispering and discussing Su Nantian's side. Their seductive glances were impossible to hide, as if they wanted to drown Su Nantian.

Zhang Xiaojun saw Su Nantian and exclaimed, "Tian Ge, you're really amazing. Just sitting here, so many beauties are watching you, but you didn't even blink."

Su Nantian lifted his eyelids and looked at Zhang Xiaojun standing there. Then he patted the leather booth beside him, "Before I change my mind and kick you out, sit down."

"Hey hey, how could you kick me out?" Zhang Xiaojun smiled and sat beside Su Nantian's arm. The next moment, he realized the distance was too close and quickly took a step back.

Su Nantian heard this and let out a snort of laughter.

"Don't mock me, Tian Ge," Zhang Xiaojun said awkwardly and rubbed his nose. He leaned over Su Nantian's ear and whispered, "Look at those girls. When I sat next to you, their eyes changed. They probably think we have something going on." After saying that, Zhang Xiaojun's eyebrows furrowed.

Su Nantian couldn't bear to look at it and rubbed his nose. "If you keep talking like that, go sit with them and be noisy."

Zhang Xiaojun quickly laughed it off and changed the topic. "By the way, Tian Ge, how did you come here? Bus or subway?"

A sharp glance from Su Nantian made Zhang Xiaojun shiver involuntarily.

"I didn't know, I thought you were so poor," Su Nantian took another glass of vodka and poured it. "I walked here."

Zhang Xiaojun's hand trembled, almost dropping the bottle. Su Nantian gave another sharp glance, and Zhang Xiaojun quickly held the cold bottle tightly.

"No, Tian Ge, you're teasing me." Realizing Su Nantian was joking, Zhang Xiaojun complained with embarrassment. He filled the wine glass and a grape aroma spread from it.

Zhang Xiaojun was immediately amused by this glass of red wine. He carefully held the cup and took a sip, the aged wine aroma instantly filling his taste buds.

"Tian Ge, did you come here just because of this bar?" Zhang Xiaojun said and accidentally bit his tongue due to the awkward wording. This made Su Nantian laugh.

"I guess I prepared the wrong martial arts for you today. I should have given you a basic comedy class to practice your mouth."

After saying that, Su Nantian actually got up. Zhang Xiaojun immediately grabbed Su Nantian's waist and begged, "Don't, Tian Ge. Give me some face. I didn't think before speaking. If you don't mind, sit down and listen to me for a while?"

The women at the bar who were always watching Su Nantian's movements immediately gasped. Su Nantian felt a vein pop on his forehead. He grabbed Zhang Xiaojun's ear and pulled him up, saying, "It's you who should give me face. Let go immediately."

Zhang Xiaojun immediately winced in pain and let go of Su Nantian's waist, then grabbed his sleeve with a pleading look.

The impact of the beauty was too strong. Su Nantian rubbed his forehead and sat back down on the sofa.

After succeeding, Zhang Xiaojun smiled brightly. He quickly doggedly refilled Su Nantian's glass. The bottle he extended was blocked by Su Nantian, who took out a thin ancient book from his coat pocket. The cover was about to break, which made Zhang Xiaojun stunned.

"Is this an antique?" Zhang Xiaojun exclaimed and quickly wiped his hands on his clothes to ensure there were no sweat or alcohol, then carefully took the book from Su Nantian's hands.

"It's not that important. The content is what matters, not the appearance," Su Nantian's lips twitched. He couldn't stand Zhang Xiaojun's spineless behavior.

"These you take back to read first. You have some foundation, so this should not be too hard for you. If you don't understand anything, come ask me," Su Nantian finished his vodka and gave Zhang Xiaojun the last reminder.

Zhang Xiaojun nodded quickly, staring at the martial arts book in his hands with eyes almost on fire.

"Tian Ge," Zhang Xiaojun asked, "can I beat you after learning this?"

"Snort." After hearing Zhang Xiaojun's innocent question, Su Nantian took a deep breath in annoyance. "What? Do you want to overthrow me with this martial arts?"

Though he said that, there was no anger in Su Nantian's expression. He just looked at Zhang Xiaojun with a strange look.

Chapter 237: Feisi Bar

The other immediately shook his head like a spinning top.

"No, Tian Ge. What are you talking about? I'm not that kind of person. As your bodyguard, I can't be too weak, right?" Zhang Xiaojun looked sad. The next moment, he thought of something and quickly rolled up the martial arts book in his hands and put it into his pocket.

This action made Su Nantian raise an eyebrow. "How, am I going to take it back?"

Zhang Xiaojun immediately smiled and said, "No, there's no such thing. I'm not afraid of it being seen outside and causing unnecessary competition." He patted the bulging pocket. "This is an object that looks like an antique, after all."
