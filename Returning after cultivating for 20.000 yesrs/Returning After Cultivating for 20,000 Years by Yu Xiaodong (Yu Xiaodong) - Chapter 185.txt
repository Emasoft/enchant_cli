Su Nantian had never interfered with Xiao Wang's crying, nor did he stop him. Instead, he silently held Xiao Wang, soothing his emotions and allowing him to weep freely.

As Xiao Wang cried on, he eventually fell asleep in Su Nantian's arms.

Su Nantian looked down and saw Xiao Wang had fallen asleep, then affectionately stroked his head.

He spoke in a low voice, murmuring words that were unclear whether addressed to Xiao Wang or himself. It was also his vow for this life.

"Xiao Wang, rest assured. From now on, you will stay by my side; I shall always protect you."

This was Uncle Wang's final advice, and it was also a responsibility he had to bear.

At that time, Uncle Wang had said that if not for Xiao Wang's sharp eyes spotting him floating on the river, he might have already drowned.

No matter how powerful his abilities were at that moment, in a state of unconsciousness, he had no chance to save himself. There would be no today.

Therefore, his life was given by Uncle Wang and Xiao Wang.

Henceforth, he would use this life to protect Xiao Wang and uncover his origins, revealing the truth to him.

Xiao Wang, rest assured. I will always care for you and protect you endlessly.

After completing this action, Su Nantian stood up. He gazed at Xiao Wang for a while, seeing him sleep soundly, then slowly stepped away.

At the door's position, he gazed at the scenery outside and was once again lost in thought.

He had lived in Xiaoyu Village for some time. According to common experience, this was the most bustling hour of the day in Xiaoyu Village.

Women from each household would come out here, chatting and picking vegetables to prepare their lunches.

At this time, there were also many children running around, playing games or simply running wildly. This was the most lively time of day, completely unlike the current silence.

Seeing this scene, Su Nantian's expression darkened again. He knew that the villagers of Xiaoyu Village were already dead, and no matter how much he cherished them, that scene in his memory would never return.

Thinking of this, Su Nantian felt an unbearable anger. He had never imagined that these people would be so cruel, killing adults and even children who didn't understand anything.

Especially when he returned and saw those children all lying in pools of blood, Su Nantian felt his blood freeze.

These children were usually the ones who clung to him, and they were well-behaved and obedient. They had no traces of disobedience, and they were at the most innocent age.

At this time, they should have been growing up carefree, but instead encountered such a catastrophic disaster.

Thinking of this, Su Nantian's fists clenched again. He stared fiercely ahead, at the entrance of Xiaoyu Village.

Unsure of what image he was recalling, Su Nantian's expression became even more solemn.

Chapter 924: He Wei

This place connected to a series of mountains. To reach the town outside, it would take several hours on foot. Even for Su Nantian with his strong legs, it would at least take two hours to get out.

Yet this idyllic place had been intruded upon and completely destroyed.

After thinking of this, Su Nantian felt even more resentment towards those people.

He did not know who these people were or why they had taken Xiao Wang. But thinking of them killing all the villagers of Xiaoyu Village, Su Nantian could not remain calm.

At the same time, Su Nantian silently vowed that he would make them pay a heavy price and repay their blood debts with blood.

Moreover, he was determined to kill them to console the souls of the villagers of Xiaoyu Village and comfort their hearts.

Su Nantian's fists suddenly clenched tighter, his eyes becoming even sharper. He knew those people were still searching for Xiao Wang's whereabouts, and the previous group had said they were part of a vast organization. As long as their goal was not achieved, Su Nantian did not worry they would give up.

Once they arrived, it would be their day of death. Su Nantian was determined to severely punish these people and make them regret the day they had attacked the villagers of Xiaoyu Village.

At the same time, He Wei was leading his people to investigate step by step and had arrived at San Shi Town outside Xiaoyu Village.

They hadn't been idle these days, continuously searching for the direction of Qin Wu.

Because previously, to hide their tracks, they had turned off all communication devices in San Shi Town.

At that time, they thought they could easily deal with the villagers and then return to the Demon Sect to report their success.

But they had not anticipated that they would encounter Su Nantian, a tough opponent. Especially thinking of Su Nantian's strength and his attacks that they could not withstand, none of them could remain calm.

Qin Wu had never expected that this carelessness would result in all of them dying and being completely annihilated. Not only could they not return to report their success, but they also couldn't save their lives.

At this moment, He Wei and his people were the same. According to their tracker, they had been tracking here but found no traces of Qin Wu's group.

"Where exactly are Qin Wu and his people? Why did they turn off their communication devices?"

When He Wei arrived here, he furrowed his brows and was very dissatisfied. To perform well in front of their master, He Wei had used all his strength.

He hurriedly traveled without stopping for a moment and quickly tracked their previous coordinates here.

But just when he thought he was about to succeed, the communication devices had been turned off, leaving them unable to find Qin Wu's location.

"But Master He, why did Qin Wu and his people do this? Why would they turn off their communication devices so suddenly?"

At that moment, one of his subordinates asked in confusion.

The communication devices were equipment each member of the Demon Sect carried, to notify the organization when they encountered danger and allow them to locate their position for rescue. It was also a way of survival for each person.

Even if one was not lucky and died before rescue arrived, at least they could use this communication device to retrieve their bodies so that they would not be left exposed in the wilderness.

Therefore, normally, members of the Demon Sect never turned off their communication devices.

But now seeing that Qin Wu had left no information at all, they were extremely puzzled. They weren't worried about Qin Wu's safety; it was just that they couldn't find his direction, which made them angry and felt he had added trouble and workload for them.

He Wei was already troubled, and when his subordinates started asking him again, he felt even more irritated: "You ask me? How would I know? Maybe he wanted to take all the credit for himself and turned off his communication device."

After furrowing his brows and thinking carefully, He Wei felt this was the most plausible assumption. He then irritably told them.

But as he said this, his face became even more grim. Qin Wu was indeed so ambitious and self-important; every time he did this.

At first, when He Wei had just joined the sect, he hadn't known Qin Wu's character and had suffered from him before. Every time they went out to scout or do the most dangerous tasks, Qin Wu always assigned them to his subordinates.

But when he found the credit, Qin Wu would take it all.

To prevent them from sharing this credit, he often turned off his communication device and wouldn't let them find his location.

After thinking of these past events, He Wei felt Qin Wu was definitely doing the same trick again and intentionally hiding his identity.

"Hmph, thinking of taking all the credit, he must be dreaming."

After thinking this through, He Wei let out a cold laugh and muttered in annoyance.

This time he had been ordered to come, and the master had directly stated that as long as he could bring back Qin Wu and complete the master's task, the one who would be favored afterwards was him, not Qin Wu.

Because of this assurance, He Wei felt he no longer had to be careful with Qin Wu or worry about him anymore.

"Everyone, stay alert and search again carefully. Since the communication devices were turned off here, it means Qin Wu's location is not far."

He Wei was very clear about Qin Wu's character and knew that although he wanted to monopolize the credit, he was also a life-loving person. Therefore, he would not truly put himself in danger.

It was likely that when Qin Wu turned off his communication device, he had already been very close to his mission goal.

Therefore, He Wei called out again and told everyone to be more alert.

"Yes, Master He!"

All his subordinates followed He Wei's lead. Upon hearing his orders, they immediately nodded without the slightest doubt or hesitation.

They also started asking others to find out which direction Qin Wu and his people had gone.

He Wei also suppressed his inner frustration and started gathering information around.

He was thinking that once he found Qin Wu, he would definitely humiliate him thoroughly and let him know that it was not only him who could hold his head high in front of the master.

They would definitely make the master change his mind. When that time came, Qin Wu would know he was no longer favored by the master and would surely show an expression of complete bewilderment, which would be very amusing.

Chapter 925: Xu Family's Movements

Just thinking of Qin Wu's dissatisfaction and surprise at himself, He Wei felt that their current hard work was worth it.

He had been suppressed by Qin Wu for so many years and finally had a chance to turn the tables. He would definitely grasp it tightly.

At the same time, He Wei thought that the master had become dissatisfied with Qin Wu for taking too long, so he wanted to finish it quickly.

To mock Qin Wu, he could wait until after he had completely lost the master's favor and then deal with him slowly.

After all, Qin Wu would definitely stay in the Demon Sect and dare not leave.

After thinking this through, He Wei felt even more excited.

He was already impatient to meet Qin Wu and wanted to show off in front of him, enjoying the same style he had used before.

Other subordinates saw He Wei's bright smile and also smiled.

They felt that as long as He Wei rose, their lives would change completely. In the future, they would have to rely heavily on He Wei.

Perhaps their luck was good, or maybe Qin Wu and his people had acted too boldly in San Shi Town without any concealment.

After sending some people to investigate, they actually found some clues.

"What is Qin Wu? We have never heard of him. However, we do have a vague memory of this person."

The residents of San Shi Town, upon hearing that He Wei and his people were looking for someone, started to recall carefully before telling them.

"They seemed to have taken Hao Ge with them. It was probably to Hao Ge's house. You should check there."

Moreover, He Wei and his people had asked those who were familiar with Hao Ge. They recognized Qin Wu's group and told this to He Wei.

But the passerby didn't know that what they had seen was not Qin Wu, but Long Ge and A Chuan. They just confused He Wei's description.

However, it was a lucky coincidence. After all, these people were also looking for Su Nantian. Perhaps they would really meet by chance.

"Hao Ge, who is this person?"

He Wei and his people asked in confusion.

"Master Hao? You don't know him?"

Hearing their confusion, the passerby seemed very surprised: "Master Hao is a local boss in this generation. Everyone respects Master Hao."

He Wei heard their description of Hao Ge and furrowed his brows, feeling dissatisfied.

But soon, He Wei suppressed his inner dissatisfaction, knowing the purpose of their visit today.

"Where exactly does Master Hao live?"

Having a local boss like this might help them achieve their goal more efficiently.

Moreover, He Wei thought this was Qin Wu's usual method. He did like to take shortcuts to get things done, which not only saved time and effort but also achieved twice the result with half the work.

After thinking this through, He Wei felt even more angry, feeling that Qin Wu was always one step ahead of him.

But when they followed the passerby's instructions and arrived at Hao Ge's house, they found it empty. Not only was there no Master Hao, but there was not even a single person.

He Wei and his people immediately furrowed their brows: "Master He, this must be a trick by that guy. There's no one here at all!"

"Yes! It must be a trick!"

Other subordinates, seeing how hard they had worked to find this person but found nothing, also started complaining.

Thinking of how they had come in the middle of the night and worked hard to find, only to be tricked, they felt even more dissatisfied.

"Never mind. It was our own fault for being too trusting."

He Wei felt very annoyed inside, but he thought that the passerby had already disappeared and they couldn't find him even if they went back.

Moreover, this time they had a purpose. It was definitely not for arguing with that passerby.

What they needed most was to find Qin Wu's location, which was the main issue.

After thinking this through, He Wei comforted his subordinates' emotions. Seeing their tired faces, he also knew that rushing would not help.

If he continued to oppress them, it might backfire and provoke their rebellious feelings.

Instead, they should rest for the night and search again tomorrow.

After thinking this through, He Wei announced that they should find a hotel to stay temporarily. Upon hearing He Wei's arrangement, all the subordinates cheered and their expressions were not obvious, but everyone was very happy.

Seeing their change in expression, He Wei knew he had made the right move.

Previously, Qin Wu was too selfish and always oppressed these subordinates. He never cared about their feelings or considered them at all, which led to the situation where everyone turned against him.

He Wei had learned from this mistake and made these adjustments and changes. Moreover, He Wei cleverly used an improved method that would not cause any negative rebellious feelings and would make them more dedicated to assisting him.

He Wei was still thinking about where Qin Wu might have gone and also felt puzzled why Qin Wu's efficiency this time was so low.

He had not returned for several days and there were no signs of him at all.

This was unlike Qin Wu's usual style.

But soon He Wei thought that these doubts would be resolved once he met Qin Wu, and there was no need to think so much here.

Moreover, He Wei wanted to find Qin Wu's flaws. The more he had to suspect about him, the happier he was. He didn't need to worry about Qin Wu here.

With this thought in mind, He Wei suppressed his inner thoughts and slowly fell asleep. However, it didn't mean others were sleeping either, especially Xu Wen from the Xu family.

Although he knew he couldn't rush and also knew that he had just issued orders to find Su Nantian,

he was extremely angry at the thought of Su Nantian coming to destroy their people, especially killing Master Xu's wife and his brother.

He longed to walk up to Su Nantian and tear him apart, letting Su Nantian's blood and flesh repay the lives of their Xu family.

But the orders he had issued had no response, as if they had sunk into the sea.

Xu Wen thought these subordinates hadn't done their best to find Su Nantian and didn't take his orders seriously. Otherwise, how could they not have found even a trace?

Chapter 926: Actions

"What the hell is this Su Nantian!"

Xu Wen couldn't help but curse under his breath. Thinking of how Su Nantian had completely caught him off guard, he was extremely angry and even felt his breathing became unsteady.

This person had appeared out of nowhere, with no signs at all, making it impossible for him to plan anything. Xu Wen had sent many people out before to find Su Nantian, desperately searching for his characteristics in order to find his weaknesses and then capture him.

But they found no information at all. It was as if the people he had sent were sunk into the sea without returning any valuable information.

Even many people outside didn't know who Su Nantian was. They had no idea about him at all.

"Damn it, you guys are useless! All of you are useless!"

Thinking about this, Xu Wen angrily smashed his cup.

He then cursed again with hatred: "You people are only good for eating, and when you need to do something, you're completely useless!"

At this point, Xu Wen glared at his subordinates with anger, feeling they were completely useless.

The people scolded by Xu Wen all lowered their heads without saying a word, not even daring to breathe. Their eyes also didn't dare to look at Xu Wen, fearing they would be the chicken that was sacrificed to scare others.

The old housekeeper also anxiously stood by, not daring to speak a word. Everyone lowered their heads even more, fearing Xu Wen would direct his gaze at them.

"Useless! All of you are useless!"

Xu Wen cursed again, seeing these people who dared to be angry but couldn't speak out, their cowardice made him even more furious.

The old housekeeper saw Xu Wen's anger getting worse and knew he couldn't stay silent anymore.

So, he carefully stepped forward and spoke cautiously to calm Xu Wen's emotions.

"Master, please calm down. It's our fault; we've caused trouble for you."

The old housekeeper carefully calmed Xu Wen's emotions and cautiously observed his expression.

"We've already sent people out. I believe they will soon return with news. Master, please rest assured."

The old housekeeper then spoke the most important information for Xu Wen.

He knew that Xu Wen was so angry because they were too slow in their work and hadn't found any information about Su Nantian yet.

Moreover, they had not even investigated Su Nantian's past, which was the main reason for Xu Wen's anger.

"Please calm down. You've done such a thing, and you still dare to ask me to calm down?"

Xu Wen heard the old housekeeper's words but became even more angry. His brows furrowed, and he transferred his anger to the old housekeeper, continuing to scold him angrily.

"I don't care. In any case, you must give me information tomorrow, whether it's about his past or where he is now."

Xu Wen furrowed his brows and coldly ordered.

After saying this, he paused for a moment and continued to demand:

"This request isn't difficult, I've already given you enough time!"

After saying this, he glared at these people. If they dared to say the word 'difficult', he would immediately deal with them.

Others knew that when Xu Wen said this, they couldn't escape anymore. So they immediately replied to Xu Wen: "Yes, yes, Master, we've understood."

After saying this, they didn't dare to breathe and felt very uneasy.

Xu Wen saw that they were finally sensible, so he nodded slightly in satisfaction and somewhat eased his emotions, no longer as angry as before.

"Remember my instructions. By the latest tomorrow, you must tell me, otherwise, all of you get out!"

After saying this, Xu Wen continued to scold them angrily and warned everyone again.

"Yes, Master, we've remembered."

Others heard Xu Wen's scolding and no longer stayed silent. They all knew that Xu Wen was really angry this time.

None of them wanted to be kicked out of the Xu family. After all, the Xu family's status in M City was unparalleled.

Just saying it out loud would make them superior, and they would have prestige. Moreover, the welfare benefits here were much better than anywhere else.

Such a good place, how could they leave?

So at this time, they all expressed their support and didn't ignore Xu Wen's meaning.

"Good. It's good to keep your word."

Xu Wen then slightly eased his mood and continued to order: "Remember my words. If you can't make me satisfied again, all of you get out."

After saying this, Xu Wen turned to the old housekeeper: "You too. If you can't handle this matter, you also get out!"

Xu Wen glared at the old housekeeper with clenched teeth. He felt they were useless and failed in everything.

Even this small problem he had assigned them, they couldn't handle it properly. And there was no response at all.

After thinking of this, Xu Wen felt even more angry and thought that if it weren't for the old housekeeper's failure, he wouldn't have been threatened by Su Nantian to this extent. He also wouldn't have had no preparation at all when facing Su Nantian.

So Xu Wen looked even more unappealing towards the old housekeeper, feeling they were just adding to his anger.

"Yes, yes, Master."

The old housekeeper was trembling at this moment.

They all knew Xu Wen's anger and that he was in a bad mood now. So no one dared to confront Xu Wen.

They just watched him carefully from the side, fearing that if they did something wrong, they would be punished by Xu Wen.

So the old housekeeper lowered his head at this time and didn't dare to look up at Xu Wen even once.

"Enough, useless waste. All of you get out!"

Xu Wen said this with dissatisfaction and sent the old housekeeper and others away.

But the most urgent thing was to quickly find out who Su Nantian really was, what background he had, and why he dared to challenge them in M City. And even more so, to oppose the Xu family.

Who didn't know that their Xu family was renowned and had stood for years in M City, making everyone who heard of it fear them?

Who knew where this Su Nantian got his confidence to challenge them?

Thinking of this, Xu Wen felt even more angry. He thought Su Nantian's actions were completely disrespectful to the Xu family.

Moreover, at this moment, Su Nantian was not only disrespecting them but also had a huge grudge against them.

Just the hatred of killing his mother and his brother was enough for Xu Wen to take revenge on Su Nantian.

Chapter 927: Each with Their Own Designs

And at this moment, Xu Wen and Su Nantian's hatred was irreconcilable!

As soon as he found an opportunity, he would definitely not spare Su Nantian and make him pay a heavy price.

Of course, this was conditional on whether Xu Wen had the ability to deal with Su Nantian.

Xu Wen at this moment did not know that his enemy he was so angry about was currently living peacefully in Xiaoyu Village, leading a simple life of waking up with the sun and sleeping when it set. He had no intention of changing anything for Xu Wen's troubles here.

Moreover, Xu Wen did not know that Su Nantian had no intention of running away or being afraid of them. He didn't even think about dealing with them.

Su Nantian was completely unaware of Xu Wen's existence. Otherwise, he would definitely return to deal with Xu Wen and prevent him from causing more trouble.

Xu Wen did not know that he was waiting for an opportunity to find Su Nantian and trouble him, while Su Nantian had no intention of considering him as an equal opponent. He didn't even think about the Xu family at this moment.

Even if Su Nantian knew that Xu Wen was searching for him extensively outside, he would not care at all. He had no fear of Xu Wen or their revenge.

Even if they did come, Su Nantian would just fight against them. But the premise was to first find those who wanted to trouble Xiao Wang and harm the villagers of Xiaoyu Village. Otherwise, Su Nantian had no time to bother with them.

So Xu Wen at this moment did not know that he was not even on Su Nantian's list, and even if he were, he would have to wait behind.

Su Nantian had no intention of dealing with this matter at all. He was not afraid of them and did not consider them as opponents.

At the same time, the opponent on Qin Wu's side, He Wei and his people were still searching in San Shi Town, determined to find Qin Wu's group and bring Xiao Wang back.

"Damn it! Where exactly is Qin Wu hiding? What is he doing? Why is he playing so many tricks?"

He Wei and his people had searched for a whole morning but found no clues or thoughts. At this moment, they were also unable to help being angry, especially thinking of Qin Wu hiding himself and not informing the Demon Sect. This made them do so much useless work, and they had to stay in this run-down town.

They were even more dissatisfied.

"Damn it! This arrogant guy!"

He Wei cursed again, his face full of dissatisfaction and anger.

"Master He, I'm sorry. We found no clues at all."

At this moment, other subordinates also came back with their heads down and dejected, walking to He Wei's side and expressing their dissatisfaction.

They really found no clues about Qin Wu. If they had, they wouldn't be so depressed now.

"Really found no clues at all?"

He Wei heard their answer and was very dissatisfied. He asked again, seeing everyone with their heads down answering, then scolded them angrily.

"So why aren't you searching faster? What are you doing just sitting around? You didn't hear the master's orders to have us catch Qin Wu as soon as possible!"

He Wei said this while also looking at these people with dissatisfaction, feeling they were lazy and didn't find any clues about Qin Wu.

Moreover, this matter was related to whether He Wei could leave a real impression on the master and replace Qin Wu as his next favored subordinate.

Therefore, He Wei was very concerned about this matter and cared deeply about it.

If these people dared to ruin his plans, he would definitely not forgive them first.

Subordinates also knew He Wei's character. Upon hearing He Wei's warning, they were all cautious and didn't dare to resist.

Moreover, they were on the same boat as He Wei. If He Wei was favored by the master, they would all benefit.

On the contrary, if this mission failed to complete the task assigned by the master, they would all suffer together. No one would have a good outcome.

Because of this consideration, they were so cautious.

Upon hearing He Wei's scolding, none of them dared to resist.

At this moment, they quickly regained their spirits and answered He Wei: "Yes, Master He."

Moreover, they were determined to find Qin Wu quickly and follow the clues provided earlier to bring back the child the master wanted.

If this were done, the master would definitely reward them generously.

After thinking of this, their previous fatigue seemed to vanish instantly. They no longer complained about the difficulty of finding people here.

Everyone felt that with a goal, they had regained their enthusiasm.

"Alright, everyone, stay alert and focused. It's only been a morning since we started searching. There are still places to check. Ask everyone in the town again. Since Qin Wu's group disappeared here, even if they had wings, they couldn't hide all their traces."

He Wei thought of this and made up his mind to have them be more alert and not miss anyone.

"Remember, everyone, thoroughly check. They can't escape."

At this point, He Wei also reminded them again to regain their spirits.

And when he said this, He Wei was very familiar with how to integrate into these people. He promised: "You are not doing this for me alone."

"You all know that you have chosen to follow me, so you are completely against Qin Wu. If we lose this battle, Qin Wu definitely won't leave you alive. Even for your own survival, you should fight with all your strength."

After saying this, He Wei paused slightly and then continued to say to them: "Also, you all know the master's character. If we complete his task and bring back Qin Wu and also bring back the child he wants, the reward the master gives us will be unimaginably great."

He paused and continued: "I think you all should know this, right?"

Upon hearing He Wei's words, the other subordinates looked at each other, as if trying to find a hint on each other's faces.

Chapter 928: Persuading the Subordinates

At this moment, they also understood what He Wei meant by these words.

They all understood the meaning contained within them. If they completed this mission well, the master would definitely reward them generously.

If they failed, it would be a death sentence. But if they succeeded, they would enjoy endless wealth and honor, and also have countless people surrounding them.

After thinking of this, comparing the two options, it was clear which one was better. They could definitely tell.

Therefore, these subordinates regained their enthusiasm and their demeanor was completely different from before.

They had only grumbled temporarily, not really wanting to give up.

Now that they knew about the great rewards behind it, they all changed completely.

They also thought this rare reward required more sacrifice.

So at this moment, they all nodded to He Wei and said: "Master He, rest assured. We understand. We will do our best to find him and bring back Qin Wu!"

They used to call Qin Wu "Master Qin," but now that they were with He Wei, they immediately changed their way of addressing Qin Wu.

As the saying goes: "When a person leaves, the tea cools down; when oil runs out, the lamp goes out."

These subordinates clearly explained this saying to anyone's eyes.

He Wei saw them regain their spirits and become full of energy, working hard for their wealth and honor. He finally sighed in relief.

He had been worried that these people wouldn't do their best to find him, which would affect his chances of being favored by the master.

But fortunately, these people were still manageable and their conditions were what they were interested in.

Otherwise, He Wei didn't know what to do.

Perhaps because of these rewards driving them, in the remaining time, even without He Wei's repeated instructions, they all worked hard and started to carefully investigate.

Moreover, they carefully followed He Wei's advice and questioned every villager in San Shi Town without missing anyone. They believed they would eventually find an answer.

And indeed, they accidentally found out that an old man had seen Qin Wu's group on that night.

According to the old man's description, this person was indeed Qin Wu.

For He Wei and his people, it was like finding a needle in a haystack; they had found it without effort. This was much more reliable than the person who reported earlier.

"They went in that direction, which is only a small fishing village. However, the fishing village is remote. Are you really going there?"

The old man said this and then paused slightly: "If you go by your own strength, it might take until nightfall."

The old man said this and then gave them a suggestive look, pointing to several old small vans next to him.

He Wei was such an intelligent person. If he didn't have this sharp eye, he wouldn't have stood out among so many followers of the Demon Sect and become one of Qin Wu's right-hand men, nor would the master have looked at him more favorably.

So after seeing the old man's hint, he tactfully said to the old man: "If you can confirm they are in the small fishing village, I'll buy these cars."

He Wei said "buy" instead of "rent."
