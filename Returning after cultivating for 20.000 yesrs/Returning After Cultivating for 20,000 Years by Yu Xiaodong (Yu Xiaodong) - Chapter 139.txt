"Another curse," Wu Chuan muttered in anger, a stark contrast to his usual composed demeanor.

Compared to his usual image, he now resembled a devil clad in the skin of a butcher—entirely dark, even rotting!

When Li Assistant heard Wu Chuan's angry curse, he dared not utter a word. He didn't even dare to breathe deeply, fearing Wu Chuan's wrath would turn on him.

Li Assistant merely pressed his head down forcefully, adopting an air of focused meditation as if he had heard nothing. He remained ignorant of all matters that should not be spoken about.

"Is there no other way?"

After venting his anger for a while, Wu Chuan finally composed himself and resumed the discussion: "You know it's only days until the wetland bidding. Wu You'er must appear as Wu Clan's representative, and she cannot afford any mistakes."

As he spoke, Wu Chuan fixed Li Assistant with a threatening gaze. His unspoken message was clear—no matter the method, Wu You'er must recover.

At minimum, she had to appear normal.

Otherwise, bringing her would disgrace him; not bringing her would spark endless speculation.

Either outcome was unacceptable to Wu Chuan, who would never allow Wu You'er to become the first stain on his honor. Not a chance!

"Then, Master Wu, I'll go discuss it with the doctor again?"

Having served Wu Chuan for years, Li Assistant had already grasped his master's unspoken meaning. He wisely refrained from further questioning and instead suggested a solution.

As he spoke, Li Assistant carefully observed Wu Chuan's expression, ready to react instantly should Wu Chuan's anger flare.

"Am I discussing this with you?"

Today, Wu Chuan's mood was entirely ruined by Wu You'er. When he heard Li Assistant's question, his suppressed anger erupted.

"I want a result! Li Mu! No matter what method you use, I demand to see Wu You'er—Wu Clan's head—unscathed and free of suspicion at the bidding!"

Wu Chuan continued his angry tirade, his gaze filled with discontent. He even addressed Li Assistant by name in his fury!

"Yes, yes, Master Wu. I understand!"

Despite Li Assistant's preparedness, he was still startled by Wu Chuan's sudden outburst. Yet he dared not show any reaction, fearing it would provoke greater anger.

Li Assistant lowered his head further and immediately replied without uttering another word.

"Remember my words, Li Mu. Don't disappoint me again."

Seeing Li Assistant's cooperation, Wu Chuan's expression slightly softened. He then issued further instructions with clear threats and warnings.

"Yes, Master Wu!"

Li Assistant responded instantly, his lips sealed tight.

He pressed his head down, his hands clenching involuntarily from tension. Yet the most anxious was his racing heart.

"Go," Wu Chuan said, his voice slightly softened. He felt a brief sense of satisfaction.

Weary, Wu Chuan rubbed his temples, unsure whether it was Wu You'er or Li Assistant who had angered him.

He waved his hand, signaling Li Assistant to leave, and closed his mouth as if he had nothing more to say.

"Remember my words—hurry and fix that useless girl."

As Li Assistant reached the door, Wu Chuan added a final warning.

"Master Wu, I shall spare no effort to fulfill your orders."

Hearing this, Li Assistant paused briefly before answering respectfully, then bowed and exited.

Chapter 696: Discipline

"That useless girl!"

After Li Assistant reached the door, his respectful demeanor vanished. In its place was anger toward Wu You'er. Clearly, he had redirected all his resentment toward her.

Li Assistant held no respect for Wu You'er; his words and actions all revealed disdain and hatred. It seemed Wu You'er was the reason he had been repeatedly rejected by Wu Chuan and doubted for his abilities.

" Heaven has a path, but you refuse to walk it; hell has no gates, yet you come willingly. Why must you oppose me, you useless girl?"

Li Assistant narrowed his eyes, a flash of cruelty in them. He then muttered bitterly: "You insist on opposing me?"

He remembered Wu Chuan had clearly stated that any method to fix Wu You'er was acceptable. If so, he would not hold back!

Even if blame must be assigned, it was Wu You'er's foolishness that forced him to act.

As he thought this, Li Assistant's mood slightly eased. He curled his lips into a more sinister smile and began walking toward Wu You'er's room.

During the journey, he let out several eerie laughs, his demeanor more terrifying and gloomy than usual.

"Creak—"

The door to Wu You'er's cell creaked open.

These days, Wu You'er had become emaciated and her mental state was worse than before. Now she often drifted between consciousness and dreams, unable to distinguish reality from illusion.

When she heard the door open, she initially thought it was a hallucination. But when she opened her eyes and saw the shadow before her, she realized someone had entered.

"Is it you, Dr. Chen?"

Wu You'er weakly asked, thinking it was Dr. Chen coming to give her an injection. She felt no surprise—only confusion, as she thought Dr. Chen had just visited.

Had her condition deteriorated so much that she could no longer tell how long it had been?

"Dr. Chen?"

Wu You'er received no response, deepening her confusion. She softly asked again, straining to identify the person before her.

Who could it be?

"It's me, Miss Wu You'er."

As Wu You'er struggled to recognize the figure, the person spoke softly. It was Li Assistant's voice.

If listened closely, one could detect a coldness in his tone, as if he were scheming or waiting to mock Wu You'er.

But Wu You'er's condition was too poor; she only recognized Li Assistant's voice and mustered enough strength to respond. She didn't notice anything strange in his tone.

"Ah, it's Li Assistant."

Wu You'er recognized the voice and rubbed her eyes slowly. She looked up at Li Assistant: "You're here for me?"

Unfortunately, Li Assistant was standing in the light, so Wu You'er could not discern his expression or facial color.

Wu You'er murmured softly, then asked: "Is it Wu Chuan again?"

After saying this, she suddenly laughed coldly. The thought of Wu Chuan gave her sudden energy; her voice was stronger than before.

"Does he still find my suffering insufficient? What else does he want me to do?"

After laughing, Wu You'er asked Li Assistant mockingly. Though brief, each word revealed her contempt and disdain for Wu Chuan.

"Ah, Miss Wu You'er is overthinking. This time, the master didn't come—only I."

Li Assistant spoke softly, his tone now more sinister. Wu You'er noticed the mockery and felt a strange unease, realizing Li Assistant was not as simple as he seemed.

At that moment, Wu You'er thought: indeed, those connected to Wu Chuan were never good people.

"What do you want?"

After sensing Li Assistant's mockery, Wu You'er grew cold and demanded harshly. She didn't realize that her determined tone was merely a weak person's futile resistance.

It was not worth fearing; if anything, it seemed amusing.

"Ah, Miss Wu You'er is joking. What can a lowly assistant do to you? You're being too cautious."

Li Assistant smiled softly, avoiding direct answers. Yet his tone felt strange. It was not as light-hearted as it should be.

Realizing this, Wu You'er's face showed more caution, and her heart began to tense. Her palms sweated, and she tightly gripped them, watching Li Assistant's every move with suspicion.

"You don't need to fear me. I know your value to the master. Even if I had a hundred chances, I wouldn't dare harm you."

Li Assistant spoke softly again. Yet Wu You'er did not relax; instead, she became more cautious and watchful.

Indeed, Wu You'er's instincts were correct. Li Assistant revealed his ambition in the next moment. He took out his phone, opened a video, and placed it before Wu You'er.

At first, the proximity of the phone prevented Wu You'er from seeing the video clearly. But soon she did.

She was stunned by the image—two people hanging high, unmistakably her parents!

"Father! Mother! Are you okay? Look at me! I'm Wu You'er!"

Wu You'er didn't know where she found the strength, but she sat up abruptly. She desperately reached for Li Assistant's phone, but he was quicker and moved it away, watching her with a sinister gaze.

Chapter 697: Continued Threats

"Ah, Miss Wu You'er, I advise you not to waste your strength. I didn't even turn on the sound; even if you scream until hoarse, your parents won't hear a word."

Li Assistant sneered, observing Wu You'er's expression with satisfaction. His lips curled into a more sinister smile, making him look terrifying.

At this moment, Li Assistant was like a demon rising from hell, eager to devour human flesh.

"What do you want?"

Wu You'er failed to grab the phone and realized her parents were unresponsive. She finally regained a bit of composure, but her eyes were red with emotion, losing all her previous strength.

"Li Assistant! I ask what you want!"

He had specifically broadcasted her parents, which was certainly not out of goodwill. Wu You'er clearly knew this.

She could also deduce Li Assistant had ulterior motives, so she clenched her fists in anger and continued to question him.

"Ah, Miss Wu You'er is a smart person; you must know what I want."

Li Assistant's mood was excellent, his anger from Wu Chuan's reprimand now calmed. He smiled meaningfully and said "Proceed" into his Bluetooth earpiece.

The live stream changed immediately. Two tall men whipped Wu You'er's parents relentlessly, each lash mercilessly. The sound of flesh tearing was clearly heard by Wu You'er.

"No! You can't do this!"

Wu You'er's eyes widened, her force almost tearing them open. She turned to Li Assistant desperately: "You can't hurt them! Don't!"

"Miss Wu You'er, you're joking. The master only said to treat you with courtesy. As for your parents, the master didn't say anything. Oh, right—there was one thing: don't harm their lives."

Li Assistant saw Wu You'er's desperation and smiled wider, enjoying the tension. He deliberately spoke in a way that made her anxious yet powerless.

"So Miss Wu You'er can rest easy; I'm just giving them a small lesson in flesh and blood. Their lives won't be harmed!"

Li Assistant added this fake assurance, but it was like salt in Wu You'er's wound.

After all, they were her parents!

How could Wu You'er watch them suffer before her eyes?

Wu You'er's father, with a strong foundation, could endure the pain without crying out. But Wu You'er's mother was a weak woman; she barely held back the first whip, but when the second fell on her, she could no longer suppress her scream.

"Don't! Li Assistant, I beg you not to! You can harm me, but please don't do this to my parents. They're innocent!"

Wu You'er was desperate, her voice thick with tears: "This has nothing to do with them! Please let them go! Li Assistant!"

Wu You'er truly cared for her parents and felt their innocence.

They had lived quietly in a small fishing village, working from dawn to dusk. But because Wu Chuan's ill intentions, they had been captured and imprisoned, never seeing the light of day.

Now because of Wu You'er's filial piety, they were suffering such cruel torment!

Wu You'er felt her heart break; it was bleeding, but she could do nothing. She couldn't save her suffering parents.

Wu You'er desperately begged Li Assistant, pleading for mercy and compassion.

"I'll cooperate with you no matter what you ask of me! Just don't harm my parents! Please, do this for me!"

Wu You'er didn't know how many times she had begged, but Li Assistant remained indifferent.

It wasn't that he was completely unmoved; rather, he was savoring the scene.

The pain from Wu Chuan's reprimand had turned into pleasure, and he wore a triumphant expression.

Li Assistant was secretly delighted but feigned a troubled face, making people nauseous.

"Ah, this isn't my fault, Miss Wu You'er!"

Li Assistant sighed mockingly and said: "Blame yourself for not cooperating. You refused the wine and chose punishment instead. Why didn't you wait until it was too late to cry?"

After saying this, Li Assistant's tone turned angry: "Besides! You made me lose face in buying a thousand years, and you've caused me embarrassment. How could I not teach you a lesson?"

"Since it's my fault, and I've burdened you, teach me! Don't torment my parents anymore! Please!"

Wu You'er now understood that Li Assistant was taking revenge, deliberately tormenting her parents.

But she had no choice but to beg Li Assistant for mercy.

"Ah, Miss Wu You'er is joking. Didn't I just tell you? You're the one the master values, so how could I dare harm you?"

Li Assistant smiled again, as if he truly didn't want to hurt Wu You'er.

In reality, Li Assistant was only refraining from harming Wu You'er due to Wu Chuan's orders. He deliberately tortured her parents to provoke Wu You'er.

And it seemed his method was quite effective.

"Ah, Miss Wu You'er, why didn't you act earlier? If you had cooperated sooner, you wouldn't have suffered this!"

Li Assistant wasn't satisfied with tormenting Wu You'er; he continued to mock her: "Why did you choose to oppose the master? At such a critical moment, why did you develop anorexia? You're making the master and me suffer!"

Li Assistant continued speaking, his thoughts malicious. Since Wu You'er wouldn't let him rest, he would not let her have an easy time either.

"Li Assistant, just say it plainly. What do you want me to do to let my parents go?"

Wu You'er wasn't foolish. After hearing Li Assistant's long speech, she had already guessed his intention.

Chapter 698: Reaching an Agreement

"Li Assistant, be direct."

Wu You'er had already guessed the truth. She stared coldly at Li Assistant, her hands clenched tightly in frustration.

It was simply because Wu Chuan had blamed Li Assistant for failing to take care of her, so Li Assistant was deliberately seeking pain from her.

Knowing Li Assistant's purpose, Wu You'er immediately pressed him further.

She didn't mind her own suffering; what mattered was her parents' safety.

As long as they were safe, Wu You'er believed Su Nantian would soon rescue them. Then they could be reunited.

Thinking of this, Wu You'er felt renewed strength. No matter what Li Assistant wanted to do to her, she had the courage to face it.

"Miss Wu You'er, how could you forget my words? The master has clearly forbidden you from being harmed. Why don't you understand?"

Li Assistant raised an eyebrow, deliberately provoking Wu You'er.

"I won't be harmed this way."

At this moment, Wu You'er forced herself to get up from the bed. She was so thin she looked like a skeleton, and her steps were unsteady. Then Wu You'er suddenly knelt before Li Assistant.

"Is this acceptable, Li Assistant? I beg you."

Wu You'er knelt and bowed her head.

"Oh no! Miss Wu You'er, what are you doing? I'm just a servant! Why are you kneeling to me? I can't accept such a great honor!"

Li Assistant's eyebrows twitched, surprised by Wu You'er's sudden action. But he quickly regained composure and began to savor Wu You'er kneeling before him.

He spoke of not being able to bear it, but his face was filled with pride and satisfaction. He had spoken for so long without any intention of letting Wu You'er get up.

Wu You'er knew Li Assistant's game, so she remained kneeling without any intention of rising.

Wu You'er didn't see kneeling as humiliation or losing her dignity; if it meant saving her parents, she would do even more degrading things!

At this moment, neither Wu You'er nor Li Assistant noticed a problem. Li Assistant was live-streaming the torture of Wu You'er's parents, but due to his overconfidence, he accidentally turned on the volume.

This meant their entire conversation was clearly heard by Wu You'er's parents, who also understood what Wu You'er was being tortured and humiliated with.

No one noticed that Wu You'er's parents, upon hearing this, clenched their fists tightly and their expressions turned to忍耐 (endurance).

"Alright, alright. Miss Wu You'er, please get up quickly! I can't bear it!"

After Wu You'er had knelt for ten minutes, Li Assistant finally seemed satisfied. He then pretended to let her up.

"Can you let my parents go?"

Wu You'er bit her lip, enduring the pain in her knees, and stood up with difficulty. She then looked at Li Assistant seriously.

"Of course."

Li Assistant, having gained his reward, knew when to stop. He didn't want to risk everything by being overconfident. If something went wrong, he would lose himself too.

Li Assistant then told the person on the other end to stop torturing Wu You'er's parents.

After hearing Li Assistant's order, Wu You'er finally sighed in relief, and her worry slightly diminished.

"Li Assistant, I hope you send a doctor to care for my parents."

At this moment, Wu You'er spoke her condition.

When Li Assistant heard this sentence, he suddenly laughed, as if he had misheard.

"Miss Wu You'er, do you know what you're saying?"

After saying this, he paused and continued mocking: "You've only just gained a little, yet you're already demanding more? Or did I give you a bit of color and now you want to open a dye shop?"

Li Assistant even felt Wu You'er was being too bold in front of him: "Don't forget, you're still a prisoner. Do you think the master truly values you? It's only because you're useful!"

"You're right. Because I'm still useful, that's why I say this."

Wu You'er clenched her fists and met Li Assistant's eyes fearlessly. This was the first time she had openly resisted.

After this incident, Wu You'er finally understood one thing: she couldn't be weak anymore. She had to stand up, or even a servant of Wu Chuan's could threaten her!

"What?"

Li Assistant clearly didn't understand Wu You'er's meaning. His eyebrows furrowed, and his gaze was full of disdain and contempt.

"I said, send a doctor to care for my parents."

Wu You'er clenched her fists again and raised her voice. After repeating her condition, she didn't give Li Assistant a chance to speak, continuing: "You said I'm useful to Wu Chuan. I remember that the wetland bidding is coming soon, and Wu Chuan will need me to be a figurehead, right?"

After saying this, Wu You'er continued negotiating with Li Assistant: "As long as you agree to my condition, I'll cooperate with Dr. Chen and appear normally at the bidding. But if you don't agree, I can't guarantee anything."

Although Wu You'er had lost a lot of weight over the past half-month due to anorexia, her arms were just bones, and her cheeks were only skin and bone. Yet none of this affected Wu You'er's aura.

In this regard, she completely overshadowed Li Assistant.

"You're threatening me!"

Li Assistant's eyes widened. At this moment, he finally understood Wu You'er's meaning.

His chest rose and fell heavily from anger, his suppressed rage evident. He glared at Wu You'er with a cruel gaze, unable to believe he had been manipulated by this little girl.

Moreover, the leverage Wu You'er held was one Li Assistant couldn't refute.

Because Wu Chuan had ordered him to fix Wu You'er, ensuring she wouldn't make a mistake at the bidding.

If she did, Li Assistant would be fired!

"You don't need to say it so harshly. Let's call it a win-win cooperation."

Wu You'er saw Li Assistant was angry and smiled, continuing.

Chapter 699: A Smart Conversation

"Li Assistant, I know you're a smart person. You know what choice is right for you."

Wu You'er continued, seeing Li Assistant's expression grow more peculiar. She knew he was upset because she had found his weakness and was now angry.

But she wasn't worried about Li Assistant's anger; they were now evenly matched, and she had found a leverage point to control him.

After saying this, Wu You'er added: "Besides, your condition is trivial for you. I believe it's just a matter of speaking, and you shouldn't refuse me this."

"Fine! You win!"

Li Assistant's face flushed red and pale alternately, pondering the feasibility of Wu You'er's words. Soon, he had no choice but to agree with her.

After agreeing, Li Assistant added angrily: "But you better remember, if you cause any more trouble, your parents will suffer again!"

He paused and continued threatening: "Besides, if you cause trouble, the first one to deal with you is the master. It won't be me!"

"Of course, these days' lessons have taught me to be very sensible."

Wu You'er said this, but a faint sarcasm appeared on her face.

She wasn't proud of having controlled Li Assistant; instead, Wu You'er felt a deep sorrow. She felt incredibly pitiful, having to use self-harm to negotiate with Li Assistant.

"Hmph! Since Miss Wu You'er is so confident, show me your sincerity!"

Li Assistant's tone was still resentful. He clearly resented being threatened by this little girl, so his words carried resentment and dissatisfaction.

After saying this, Li Assistant clapped twice. Immediately, someone pushed the door open, carrying various dishes that looked delicious.

Unfortunately, these meals, which others found appealing, became Wu You'er's nausea trigger. As soon as she saw the food, she felt a wave of nausea.

Even though her stomach was empty, it still churned violently.

"Vomit—"

Wu You'er immediately turned her head away from the food, but the smell triggered a violent dry heave.

Wu You'er's face turned pale instantly, looking pitiful.

Although she tried hard to resist, her body's reaction was impossible to overcome.

Wu You'er endured for a while but eventually collapsed, vomiting violently.

"Miss Wu You'er, this is your sincerity?"

Li Assistant, seeing Wu You'er's discomfort after her embarrassment, felt immense satisfaction. He knew Wu You'er was trying hard to overcome her body's instincts but still mocked her at this moment.

"If you're like this, we might have to change our agreement."

Li Assistant spoke with a threatening tone. His gaze was also subtly mocking, as if watching the show.

"No, I just haven't adapted yet. Give me a little more time; I can overcome it."

Wu You'er's face was pale and lifeless, but upon hearing Li Assistant wanted to change his mind, she immediately became anxious. She worried about her parents and feared they would be tortured again.

"I can adapt!"

Wu You'er immediately grabbed the food and forced it into her mouth, trying to chew and swallow for Li Assistant's benefit.

But her body immediately reacted with a violent dry heave, and the rejection reaction was even stronger than before. None of the food had been swallowed; it all came up again.

"Tsk tsk."

Li Assistant watched Wu You'er, seeing her vomiting repeatedly and food scattered on the floor. He immediately frowned in disgust.

"It seems Miss Wu You'er still can't show her sincerity."

Li Assistant spoke coldly, showing no mercy: "If so, Miss Wu You'er shouldn't force yourself. I'll go talk to your parents instead."

This sentence meant he would continue torturing Wu You'er's parents.

"Don't!"

Wu You'er understood Li Assistant's implication and shouted desperately, then immediately pleaded: "No, I just haven't adapted yet. Give me a little more time! The bidding is only a week away, and I'll definitely be able to!"

Wu You'er said this while desperately grabbing the food, trying to chew and swallow for Li Assistant's benefit: "Look, I can do it. I'll definitely adapt by then and won't make you suffer!"

"Enough, don't try to deceive me."

Li Assistant looked at Wu You'er with disgust and said: "Three days. I can't wait a week. If you still can't overcome your problem in three days, don't blame me for being merciless!"

Li Assistant wouldn't truly give Wu You'er a week. If he did, would he need to find other backdoors?

So this three-day period was Li Assistant's last mercy toward Wu You'er.

"You remember, you only have three days. If after three days you're still like this, don't blame me for being merciless!"

After saying this, Li Assistant coldly added: "If you continue like this, don't say I'll act. Even the master won't tolerate you."

After saying this, Li Assistant didn't want to stay any longer. He gave Wu You'er a meaningful glance and then left briskly.

After all, Wu Chuan's main concern was the wetland bidding. If Wu You'er still dragged behind at that time, even if he didn't speak, Wu Chuan would never forgive her. Li Assistant just needed to watch the show from the sidelines.

Wu You'er watched Li Assistant's back as he left, then bit her lip and pressed on her uncomfortable stomach. She looked at the steaming food, clenching her fists.

It was time to go all out!

She would definitely overcome her anorexia; she absolutely wouldn't burden her parents again.

Thinking of this, Wu You'er immediately grabbed the food in front of her and repeated the swallowing action. Her body's reaction was still strong, constantly rejecting and resisting these foods.

But Wu You'er, for her parents' sake, gritted her teeth and endured stubbornly.

Chapter 700: Misinformation

"Vomit—"

No matter how many times Wu You'er repeated the action, her body's instinct still expelled all the food. The room echoed with Wu You'er's painful dry heaves.

Yet Wu You'er never gave up, vomiting and then stuffing again. She kept repeating this, desperately fighting against her body's instincts.

Wu You'er was enduring unknown suffering in the Wu Clan, but Su Nantian, who had been secretly operating within the Nan Gong Clan, hadn't been idle. He continuously moved around places where messages could be passed to gather information.

Both of them were persisting in their own ways, without choosing to give up.

As Su Nantian continuously probed for information about Wu You'er and her parents, Green Fence finally responded.

Su Nantian didn't have time to be happy; he immediately went to the agreed meeting place with Green Fence.

"Do you have news?"

When Su Nantian saw Green Fence, he first carefully checked her to ensure she wasn't followed and that no listening devices were attached. Only then did he relax and speak.

Su Nantian had made an agreement with Green Fence to monitor Wu You'er's condition and inform him immediately if she was found.

So Su Nantian asked Green Fence this question.

"No, Mr. Su, I haven't found where Miss Wu You'er is being held."

To his surprise, Green Fence shook her head like a bobbing top and gave the opposite answer.

"What?"

Su Nantian was stunned, looking at Green Fence with a slight surprise. If he wasn't so patient, he would have questioned whether she was playing tricks with him!

"No, no, Mr. Su, don't get upset yet. I haven't finished speaking."

Green Fence realized her words were ambiguous and might be misunderstood, so she quickly shook her head and explained anxiously.

"I haven't found where Miss Wu You'er is being held, but I've discovered a good piece of news."

Green Fence continued immediately, looking at Su Nantian seriously: "Miss Wu You'er's condition seems to have improved. Today, the kitchen sent a lot of food for Miss Wu You'er."

Green Fence recalled and quickly told Su Nantian, her face also showing a smile of joy.

Previously, Green Fence knew Wu You'er had developed severe anorexia and couldn't eat anything. She relied on family doctors giving her injections to maintain her health.

So now, seeing the kitchen sending food for Wu You'er, Green Fence immediately thought she had improved.

Upon hearing this good news, Green Fence didn't hide it but immediately shared the news with Su Nantian.
