“Gao Peng, stop spinning around; it's making my eyes dizzy.”

“Master Gao, forgive me for being so excited,” Gao Peng smiled.

“Young Master Gao, are you truly certain he can complete the array? Though he surprised us by curing your sister’s illness, I think that's all he can do.”

Upon hearing Su Nantian had arrived, Gao Yi hurriedly returned from outside. He remembered the bet clearly and insisted on witnessing it himself before believing.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t accept being a subordinate.

“Gao Yi, don’t hesitate to exchange ideas with Master Su. If he’s willing to teach you even a fraction of his knowledge, it would be enough for your entire life,” Gao Qingyun smiled.

“Grandpa…” Gao Yi was surprised his grandfather regarded Su Nantian so highly.

Seeing Su Nantian emerge, the three men stared at him with varying expressions—skepticism, excitement, admiration.

“Long wait,” Su Nantian said, smiling at Gao Yi. “Hmph, you also came? I thought you’d forgotten.”

“Rest assured, a man’s word is his bond,” Gao Yi said defiantly.

Su Nantian smiled but said nothing. He approached the table, picked up a jade stone, and his fingers danced across its surface, leaving intricate mystical inscriptions.

Su Nantian completed nine different seals on the nine jade stones in one breath.

Gao Qingyun and Gao Peng’s eyes reflected undeniable shock. They had never seen such inscriptions before; they radiated profound Daoist principles, deep and unfathomable.

Gao Yi, however, saw nothing special. “Drawing lines on a stone—anyone can do that.”

“Done,” Su Nantian said. “Once these nine stones are placed in specific positions, the Gao Family Manor’s spiritual energy will awaken.”

Su Nantian stored the remaining nine stones in his ring.

Gao Qingyun, Gao Peng, and Gao Yi watched the stones vanish with contemplative expressions.

Magic? A trick?

What was going on—completely incomprehensible.

At this moment, Gao Peng noticed Su Nantian now wore a ring. Could it be…

Gao Peng’s heart pounded violently. He suppressed his curiosity and refrained from asking. Compared to this, he was more eager for the array’s completion.

The group followed Su Nantian outside. In an instant, they vanished; after nine flashes, the entire Gao Family Manor had changed.

Their gazes at Su Nantian now carried disbelief. Though intelligence suggested Su Nantian was powerful, they hadn’t faced equal strength before.

But today’s first glimpse of Su Nantian’s power made them realize the Gao Family was invincible. They couldn’t even catch his movements, let alone fight.

Even if they outnumbered him, they’d be nothing but targets.

Feeling the spiritual energy around them surge, Gao Peng nearly jumped with excitement. Even Gao Yi finally surrendered from his heart, or rather, willingly became Su Nantian’s subordinate.

Gao Qingyun’s gaze at Su Nantian burned with fervor. If he could be with Gao Jingjing, the Gao Family would enter another golden age, and he could finally rest easy.

Chapter 65: Shock

Su Nantian took a deep breath, and the surrounding atmosphere gradually stabilized. His eyes swept over the astonished Gao family members, his face expressionless as he said, “The array is complete. Is there an empty room? I need to adjust.”

At this moment, everyone was thrilled and deeply grateful toward Su Nantian.

Gao Jingjing immediately ordered servants to prepare a room. She personally escorted Su Nantian to the door.

At the entrance, Gao Yi rushed over. His face still carried a hint of embarrassment from his earlier excitement. The boy scratched his head, frowning as he said to Su Nantian: “Alright, you won. I yield. I’ll be your subordinate!”

He then bolted, vanishing into the corridor.

Gao Jingjing muttered under her breath, apologizing: “Gao Yi’s such a reckless kid. Don’t take it personally.”

Su Nantian was naturally indifferent; gaining a subordinate made him happy.

Now at the room’s entrance, Gao Jingjing didn’t want to intrude. She said: “Rest first. If you need anything, I’m always available.”

She smiled sweetly. Her beauty was already striking, but her smile made her even more radiant. However, Su Nantian had no time to appreciate it; the array’s completion was smooth, but after a full round, he felt exhausted. Plus, he needed to use this time to refine his cultivation. If he could break through, his power would rise another level.

The room was spacious. Su Nantian sat on the floor, legs crossed, and closed his eyes.

He took a deep breath. His internal energy surged rapidly, his lower abdomen warmed slightly, and a faint golden light flickered across his chest.

After a while, he felt as if on fire.

Oh no!

Su Nantian immediately activated his cultivation technique, but the burning sensation spread across his body. His chest felt excruciating pain. Without hesitation, he slapped his chest with a palm, and a massive wave of pain surged through him. He instantly collapsed, paralyzed.

A moment later, he slowly regained consciousness; the exhaustion had vanished.

Su Nantian shivered. He mustn’t rush.

Though his cultivation method hadn’t broken through, the entire process had left him feeling much lighter.

Su Nantian exhaled and prepared to step outside.

As he opened the door, he found Gao Qingyun standing there.

“Is there something you need?” Su Nantian respectfully asked. After all, Gao Qingyun was his elder.

Gao Qingyun highly valued this young man. He had helped the Gao Family so much; he must express gratitude thoroughly.

Gao Qingyun chuckled, his expression carrying admiration.

He said: “Nantian, how are you feeling?”

Su Nantian nodded, reassuring him it was fine.

“You’ve done so much for the Gao Family. Tell me what you want—anything I can do, I’ll get it for you.”

Su Nantian knew Gao Qingyun’s capabilities and the family's strength. But he truly had no need for anything else—Gao Jingjing, a beautiful girl and mobile cultivation resource, and Gao Yi had already agreed to be his subordinate. What else could he ask for?

Su Nantian shook his head, saying: “No need. This is my duty; expressing gratitude feels too distant!”

At this moment, Su Nantian had climbed another level in Gao Qingyun’s esteem.

“Nantian, Jingjing and Yi are both in the hall. Would you like to join me?”

His body was fine, but the lack of a breakthrough was regrettable.

Su Nantian nodded.

When they arrived at the hall, the little Taoist was clinging to Gao Jingjing, calling her “sister” repeatedly. Gao Yi stood nearby; upon seeing Su Nantian, he quickly lowered his head, staring at his feet. He had already submitted to this elder brother but felt embarrassed and avoided eye contact.

“Nantian has truly helped a lot,” Gao Qingyun said. “Tonight, we must keep him for dinner. Let Gao Yi send you back.”

Hearing the word “elder brother,” Gao Yi quickly lifted his head, face slightly flushed. He glared at his grandfather and muttered under his breath.

Children! Always so awkward.

Su Nantian didn’t mind; Gao Yi had already accepted him as a subordinate.

While sipping tea, Su Nantian noticed a door nearby. It was slightly open, revealing a jade table. Curious, he saw the table must be priceless and asked: “What is this table?”

Gao Qingyun thought Nantian liked it, so he ordered someone to bring the table out.

Eight people carried it slowly.

It was a Go board. The table had a deep green hue, glowing translucently under the light. Gold thread outlined squares on its surface; beside it were two jade Go boxes, with black and white stones made entirely of precious jade.

It was grand, definitely expensive.

Su Nantian marveled: “A fine table!”

“Like it?” Gao Qingyun asked. “If you like, I’ll give it to you.”

“Nantian has excellent taste. This table is made of jade, the stones are from the south, and even the gold thread comes from Africa. It’s the same as the gold in the queen’s crown.”

Gao Qingyun spoke with pride. This table had been hard to obtain; he cherished it dearly, and it was priceless. If anyone else asked for it, he wouldn’t give it. But since it was Su Nantian, naturally different—he would give it.

Su Nantian shook his head: “I never take what others cherish. Besides, this table would lose value with me. Keep it.”

Gao Qingyun saw the board and said: “Can you play Go?”

Go?

Su Nantian hadn’t played in a long time. Whether he could or not would be clear on the board!

“Play a game?”

Gao Qingyun was a Go enthusiast. He had built this board to play a good game. Yet, for years, he hadn’t found an opponent—truly a lonely champion.

Seeing Su Nantian’s interest, he nodded: “Then let’s play.”

They sat on specially crafted crystal chairs. Black stones for the Gao Family, white for Su’s.

They faced each other across the board. Su Nantian chuckled: “Master Gao, this is a friendly match, but please don’t hold back.”

Go required skill and strategy. He wouldn’t soften his moves just because of their relationship; instead, he would focus more.

Gao Qingyun nodded: “Of course. Who will make the first move?”

Su Nantian quickly said: “As you are an elder, it should be your move.”

This made Gao Qingyun’s impression of Su Nantian improve further. This young man was not only powerful but also respectful toward elders, showing no arrogance or overstepping. Truly rare.

Thus, Gao Qingyun didn’t continue with formalities but nodded slightly and made the first move.

Chapter 66: Reaching an Agreement

Go emphasized territory, creating and blocking vital points. More importantly, it required a strong overall perspective and foresight, complemented by unwavering patience. Thus, Go was like a miniature battlefield.

As an ex-Immortal disciple and an elderly man over seventy, Gao Qingyun had seen the world’s trials. His Go skills reflected composure and balance.

Though Gao Qingyun spoke politely, he was confident in defeating the seemingly young Su Nantian. He couldn’t know Su Nantian had lived two thousand years in the Immortal realm.

Su Nantian, a two-thousand-year-old demon, was skilled in music, calligraphy, painting, and Go. He played white stones with steady progress, embodying his image—elegant yet fierce.

After a battle of wits, Gao Qingyun was defeated without doubt—this despite Su Nantian giving him several moves. However, Su Nantian’s moves were subtle enough to preserve Gao Qingyun’s dignity.

“Old man admits defeat. Old man admits defeat!” The old man repeatedly waved his hands, but a smile lingered on his face.

After years of never losing a game, Gao Qingyun had another thought: this young man was too mysterious. He must do everything to bind him to the Gao Family’s cause—perhaps he was the key to their next step.

“Master Su, you are young and accomplished. I have a request—do you mind hearing it?”

Gao Qingyun praised Su Nantian greatly. This was the perfect time to bring up Gao Jingjing’s earlier request for Su Nantian to accompany her to school.

Su Nantian’s victory over Gao Qingyun made Gao Yi and others marvel at his versatility. Especially Gao Jingjing’s gaze toward Su Nantian, which was clearly that of a girl for an idol. This made Su Nantian very satisfied.

His good mood made him agree readily: “Master Gao, no need for formality. Please speak.”

Gao Qingyun felt a surge of hope but remained cautious: “Can Master Su accompany Jingjing to Fengyue University for school?”

“Uh.” Su Nantian’s face showed a hint of awkwardness.

He had read some online novels at Lin Suyun’s house. Upon hearing Gao Qingyun’s request, he immediately thought of how rich families employed bodyguards to accompany their children. He hadn’t expected it would happen so fast.

Gao Qingyun noticed Su Nantian’s expression and realized he must have misunderstood. He quickly explained: “Master Su, don’t misunderstand. How could I ask you to be Jingjing’s servant? This Fengyue University isn’t an ordinary secular university. It was established years ago by the Gao Family of Fengcheng, Bai Family of Jiangzhou, Xu Family of Linyin, and Yueshi Tea House. Its purpose is to select the best among these aristocratic families for intensive training, so they can compete regularly with other similar universities for spots in Kunlun cultivation.”

Even Gao Family’s direct descendants had to compete to enter Kunlun. This made Su Nantian more interested in Earth’s cultivation world.

Su Nantian’s contemplative expression made Gao Qingyun realize his words might not directly benefit Su Nantian. He feared rejection, so he added: “I wish Master Su could teach Jingjing and help her. Also, Kunlun has more abundant cultivation resources—perhaps they could be useful to Master Su as well.”

Gao Qingyun’s second sentence made him feel a bit guilty. After all, Su Nantian’s power was clearly unfathomable; it wasn’t clear if he would value the resources.

Su Nantian, however, didn’t care about Gao Qingyun’s thoughts. He saw that agreeing to Gao Qingyun’s request would let him be by Gao Jingjing’s side daily and also allow him to learn more about Earth’s cultivation world. Plus, the Gao Family’s secular influence would make his tasks easier—no need to fight directly if things went wrong.

After weighing all the benefits, Su Nantian readily agreed to Gao Qingyun’s request.

“Yay!” Gao Jingjing, who had been anxiously waiting, cheered. Her face was full of anticipation and excitement—completely satisfied with Su Nantian accompanying her to school.

Even experienced as Su Nantian was, he felt his face redden. Though back on Earth, he had gradually gotten used to being admired by girls, this极品 beauty’s admiration still made him happy.

Though he thought this would surely make Lin Suyun jealous, he believed things would work out eventually.

Since he had decided to accompany Gao Jingjing to school and guide her in cultivation, Su Nantian proposed his earlier idea: to improve the Gao Family’s martial arts. This would enhance their strength and make it easier for them to help him later.

“Master Gao, I wish to improve the current Gao Family’s martial arts. May I see them?”

“No problem, then please.”

Though altering ancestral martial arts was a big taboo in great families, Gao Qingyun had placed his hopes on Su Nantian. This young man had already given him many surprises, so he agreed readily.

He was eager to see how the modified Gao Family martial arts would turn out.

Actually, Su Nantian could have given the Gao Family Immortal realm martial arts. But he was more concerned about avoiding unnecessary trouble.

Better to use the Gao Family’s existing martial arts. Studying Earth’s martial arts was also a way to understand Earth’s cultivation world.

Thus, both sides were happy.

The little Taoist was also delighted; after brief interaction, he had a strong liking for Gao Jingjing.

In his mind, Gao Jingjing was now somewhat of Su Nantian’s disciple. This meant more chances to see the beautiful sister, so he was very happy.

As night fell, the Gao Family invited Su Nantian to dinner.

Su Nantian refused to idle, deciding immediately to modify the martial arts at the Gao Family. He locked himself in a room for research.

The little Taoist continued to cling to Gao Jingjing, playing with her.

At 8 PM, at Lin Suyun’s house.

Lin Suyun idly played a match-3 game, occasionally checking messages. After playing felt uninteresting, she refreshed news and videos. No matter how she tried to distract herself, she still felt annoyed.

“This stupid Su Nantian is getting too bold! He’s so late and hasn’t even called me.”

Lin Suyun sat on the bed, holding her phone. Her face was angry, lips pouted cutely as she sulked alone.

At this moment, the doorbell rang. Lin Suyun’s face immediately turned from gloomy to cheerful—surely Su Nantian had returned.

She quickly got out of bed and ran to open the door. But it was Yao Lina instead.

Her happy mood immediately vanished, and she muttered: “It’s you, Lina.”

Yao Lina obviously noticed Lin Suyun’s disappointment. She rolled her eyes and said: “What, don’t you welcome me? If not, I’ll leave.” She pretended to turn around and leave.

Lin Suyun grabbed Yao Lina’s arm, forcing a smile. She coquettishly said: “Come on, how could I not welcome you? Come in.” She even stuck out her tongue and made a face.

Yao Lina, being an overbearing person, didn’t dwell on it.

As they walked into the house, she said: “Tell me, who made our little Suyun upset? I’ll kick him to death!”

Yao Lina was Lin Suyun’s best friend for a reason. She could read her like a book, instantly sensing Lin Suyun’s unhappiness.

Chapter 67: The Jealous Woman

“Isn’t it all because of that big fool Su Nantian! He’s so late and hasn’t even called me!” Lin Suyun vented to Yao Lina about Su Nantian.

“Hahahaha.” Yao Lina laughed with a silver bell-like sound.

Lin Suyun was exasperated. She had expected her best friend to comfort her, but instead, she laughed at her. She no longer wanted to talk to her.

Yao Lina finished laughing and said: “I thought it was something big, but it’s just this. Lin Suyun, you’re already acting like a wife before marriage! You’re so cute!” She pinched Lin Suyun’s face.

“Ugh, annoying! You and that fool are the same—annoying! You even laughed at me!” Lin Suyun’s face hurt, she scolded.

“Okay, okay, I won’t tease you anymore. But you’re silly! He didn’t call you—why don’t you call him?” Yao Lina gave Lin Suyun advice.

Lin Suyun slapped her forehead, exclaiming it was wise. This made Yao Lina laugh again—love truly makes women dumb.

She quickly dialed Su Nantian’s phone. The answer was a sweet female voice.

“Hello, are you looking for Master Su Nantian?” The voice was timid.

Lin Suyun’s heart dropped. Checking the time and considering the situation, she concluded Su Nantian must have gone out with another woman! Calling him “Master Su Nantian” so affectionately! And the girl’s age was clearly young!

At this moment, Su Nantian had finished dinner and gone into the room specially prepared for him by the Gao Family. He was researching how to modify the martial arts and was almost done.

Because he had left his phone outside during dinner, it was Gao Jingjing who answered the call.

Gao Jingjing saw the caller ID showed “Lin Suyun,” so she said: “You must be a friend of Master Su Nantian. I saw the name ‘Lin Suyun’ on the screen, so I’ll call you Sister Suyun.”

“Who is this? Let Su Nantian answer!” Lin Suyun was furious, her tone unkind.

Gao Jingjing didn’t know why the woman sounded so angry but replied politely: “Hello, I’m Gao Jingjing from the Gao Family. Master Su Nantian is staying with my grandfather for dinner and is currently in his room refining the martial arts. He should be done soon.”

Upon hearing “Gao Jingjing,” Lin Suyun remembered. The girl Su Nantian said he was living with was named Gao Jingjing, and the house near Fengyue University was prepared for her.

You bastard Su Nantian! You’ve already gone to visit the family!

Lin Suyun had no time to care about the details. She felt she must go to the Gao Family and drag Su Nantian back. It was late at night, and he might do anything with another person!

Thinking of how Su Nantian’s younger brother had no self-control when facing her, Lin Suyun now cursed Su Nantian in her heart.

If she didn’t go and catch him, with this girl’s help, he wouldn’t resist!

Lin Suyun asked for the Gao Family’s address and rushed with Yao Lina to find Su Nantian.

Hastily going downstairs, they had both drunk a little alcohol. Lin Suyun was unhappy at home, and Yao Lina had also drunk before coming to visit. So they called a Didi car.

The car arrived shortly—a fancy Rolls-Royce Phantom, priced at 9 million RMB in China.

Actually, everyone knew that driving such a luxury car to do Didi services was usually for rich second-generation sons looking to flirt.

Gao Qiguang was no exception. He was the son of Gao Shengyun from Haolin Real Estate, known for his idleness and love for fighting and flirting.

But Gao Shengyun placed all his hopes on his eldest son, Gao Hongguang, who had a cultivation body type. With money and resources, he didn’t care much about this useless younger son—just as long as he didn’t cause a death.

Gao Qiguang had driven his most luxurious car out again to find prey. This method had worked before.

When he saw Lin Suyun and Yao Lina, two beautiful women, his heart was overjoyed. He already imagined a wild three-way scenario.

“Hello, ladies! Glad to serve you. Are you going to the Gao Family Manor?” Lin Suyun and Yao Lina got in, and Gao Qiguang turned around with a smile.

But to others, it looked猥琐.

The two women were experienced and immediately recognized the oily, self-proclaimed handsome rich second-generation as what he was. They didn’t respond.

Throughout the ride, Gao Qiguang made small talk, but the women remained cold.

Gao Qiguang didn’t mind; he had seen many self-righteous women before. He planned to use a secluded forest near the Gao Family Manor for his plan, and if soft methods failed, he would resort to force. Though he was a useless son in the Gao Family and wasn’t respected, he believed even if he misbehaved, the family wouldn’t help outsiders against him.

Gao Qiguang plotted silently and stopped talking.

Lin Suyun was restless throughout the ride, feeling a deep sense of crisis upon thinking about the unknown Gao Jingjing. She didn’t know why.

She was too annoyed to stay quiet, so she started talking with Yao Lina.

“Lina, do you think Su Nantian really likes Gao Jingjing?”

Lin Suyun hadn’t thought much when she called earlier because of her anger. Now, after calming down, she realized Grandpa had mentioned the Gao Family’s status in Fengcheng. She figured Gao Jingjing was definitely a high-status family member, possibly an attractive girl—this was why she felt uneasy.

Unintentionally said, but heard by Gao Qiguang. He took notice of the name “Gao Jingjing.”

Though he had never met the core members of the Gao Family, he knew Gao Jingjing, his cousin. He had long desired her beauty but lacked the courage.

Of course, he was just a toad dreaming of a swan. After all, the Gao Family never looked at him.

“Don’t worry, Suyun. Don’t think too much now. Once we get to the Gao Family, you’ll see what Gao Jingjing is really like. You said she’s just a girl; give her a lesson and show her you’re not easy to mess with. She won’t dare think about your Su Nantian anymore.” Yao Lina comforted Lin Suyun.

Actually, Yao Lina accompanied Lin Suyun for her own reasons. She also had an unclear feeling toward Su Nantian, so she wanted to see what Gao Jingjing was like.

Chapter 68: Let Your Father Wait to Collect Your Body

Gao Qiguang, who had been listening to Lin Suyun and Yao Lina’s conversation in the driver's seat, was even more determined to take these two women.

Because they clearly had a grudge against his cousin Gao Jingjing, helping the family eliminate this trouble was perfect.

“Master Gao Qingyun might even thank me for it.”

Gao Qiguang thought proudly.

But this time, his plan was completely wrong.

During the rest of the ride, Lin Suyun and Yao Lina were both preoccupied with their thoughts and didn’t talk.

Around 10 PM, the car arrived near the Gao Family Manor.

The lights of the main building were clearly visible.

But instead of driving on the main road they had taken earlier, Gao Qiguang turned into a remote forest path before reaching the main road.

Yao Lina, who was playing with her phone, didn’t notice anything unusual.

Because the signal on this road was poor, Lin Suyun hadn’t called Su Nantian again.

But after seeing the lights of the Gao Family Manor, Lin Suyun took out her phone and called again.

“Hello, Sister Suyun. Have you arrived?” It was still Gao Jingjing’s voice.

Lin Suyun’s jealousy flared again, but she calmed herself down upon thinking about meeting the “third party.”

“Yes, my friend and I have arrived at the entrance of the manor,” Lin Suyun said calmly.

“No, Sister Suyun. I’m right at the entrance of the manor now. I haven’t seen any car coming,” Gao Jingjing said, with wind sounds in the background. She was definitely outside.

“Wait a moment. Don’t hang up. I’ll ask the driver.”

Lin Suyun held the phone and said to Gao Qiguang: “Driver, did you take a wrong turn? We already saw the Gao Family Manor. Just go to the main gate.”

Gao Qiguang didn’t answer but sped up.

This was a small road, not very smooth.

Plus, the Rolls-Royce Phantom had strong power. Gao Qiguang suddenly accelerated, giving a strong push-back sensation.

Yao Lina and Lin Suyun, who weren’t wearing seat belts in the back, were thrown against the headrests. Their phones also fell.

“Stupid bastard! What are you doing? Can’t you drive?” Yao Lina, who was hot-tempered, cursed Gao Qiguang.

“Cuss all you want. You’ll scream louder later. Hahahaha.” Gao Qiguang laughed loudly, revealing his true colors.

Lin Suyun and Yao Lina immediately understood Gao Qiguang’s intention. This scumbag had deliberately taken them on this remote path.

But Lin Suyun wasn’t panicked. Yao Lina, who was more careless, had no sense of danger.

“Fool! You think your boyfriend is in the Gao Family Manor. He won’t let you off!”

Lin Suyun calmly said to Gao Qiguang.

“Haha, is your boyfriend so strong?”

“You know who I am? My father is Gao Shengyun from Haolin Real Estate. We are the family of the Gao Family!”

“You’re trying to harm Gao Jingjing, right? I’ll help her get rid of you two. Wait and enjoy, little girl. Be quiet, brother won’t hurt you.” Gao Qiguang said again, disgustingly.

After hearing Gao Qiguang’s words, Lin Suyun quickly thought.

She suddenly realized this lecher was sent by Gao Jingjing to deal with her and Yao Lina.

Lin Suyun cursed herself for being so foolish, coming without precautions and falling into the trap.

Gao Jingjing was now thoroughly hated by Lin Suyun. Not only was she a third party, but she also used underhanded methods.

Yao Lina, on the other hand, was more composed. She noticed this remote place and the lack of people at night. Calling for help would be too late.

Now, the only hope was Su Nantian in the Gao Family Manor!

Yao Lina had already picked up her phone. When Gao Qiguang boasted, she hadn’t noticed that Yao Lina had secretly sent a message to Su Nantian’s phone.

Meanwhile, Gao Jingjing heard Lin Suyun say she would ask the driver. Then there was no more response.

Since Lin Suyun’s phone only vibrated but didn’t hang up, Gao Jingjing still heard the commotion on the other end.

But since she didn’t understand the details, she couldn’t rashly go out to find her.

Gao Jingjing thought and hung up, then went back to tell Su Nantian about this.

As she walked back, Su Nantian’s phone rang.

Gao Jingjing opened it and saw a message: “I and Suyun were taken by a black Rolls-Royce Phantom. Location is the forest near the southeast of the Gao Family Manor. The driver’s father is Gao Shengyun.”

Seeing “Gao Shengyun,” Gao Jingjing immediately knew the driver was Gao Qiguang.

Though she didn’t know him well, she had heard of this useless son’s misdeeds.

At once, Gao Jingjing ran home and briefly reported the situation to her grandfather.

“This shameless bastard! Cough, cough!” Gao Qingyun coughed violently upon hearing it.

His main concern was that he heard the girl named Lin might be closely related to Su Nantian.

If something happened to her, not only would Su Nantian no longer help the Gao Family, but they might also turn against them!

No time to waste. Gao Qingyun ordered Gao Jingjing to immediately find Su Nantian, who was still refining the Gao Family’s martial arts.

Su Nantian listened to Gao Jingjing’s account. His face grew darker, and he unintentionally crushed the teacup in his hand.

“Jingjing, do me a favor. Have your grandfather call Gao Shengyun. I’ll be back soon.”

“Okay, Nantian, then we…”

Before Gao Jingjing could finish, Su Nantian jumped out the window and vanished into the night.

Because Lin Suyun and Yao Lina kept arguing, Yao Lina even scratched Gao Qiguang’s face.

Gao Qiguang was fed up and took out a rarely used strong sedative, spraying it at Lin Suyun and Yao Lina.

The two women couldn’t resist the drug’s effects and fell unconscious.

Seeing them quiet, Gao Qiguang pulled over.

This eager lecher saw no one around and that they were far enough from the Gao Family Manor. He didn’t turn off the lights.

The back seat was spacious, but with three people, it was limited.

So Gao Qiguang pulled Lin Suyun out of the car and placed her in the front passenger seat. He decided to first attack Yao Lina, who had been the most troublesome.

“Beauty, brother’s here!” Gao Qiguang hurriedly took off his pants and looked at Yao Lina’s long legs, eyes glowing green.

“Hey, buddy. It's late and cold. Need a light?” A casual male voice unexpectedly spoke, startling Gao Qiguang.

He looked around. Under the car lights, he saw a handsome man leaning lazily by the back of the car, holding a cigarette that wasn’t lit.

“Not at all. Get out! You don’t see I’m about to have a car ride with my girlfriend!” Gao Qiguang shouted angrily, annoyed by this stranger ruining his fun.

The man with the cigarette didn’t move but asked: “Is your father Gao Shengyun?”

“Yes! My father is Gao Shengyun, the family head!” Gao Qiguang wanted to kill this kid for his endless questions.

The man didn’t get angry. He lit a wisp of purple fire and ignited the cigarette. This man was Su Nantian.

Su Nantian casually blew out a smoke ring and said: “Good. I’ve already informed your father to prepare for your funeral.”

Chapter 69: She is my girlfriend

Upon hearing Su Nantian’s words, Gao Qiguang first blinked in surprise, then laughed loudly.

“Hey, are you a fool? Do you know who I am? I’m the nephew of Master Gao Qingyun! Try to touch me!”

Seeing this Gao Qiguang was truly stubborn, Su Nantian didn’t say more.

They were ten steps apart. Su Nantian flicked the cigarette in his hand.

“I hope you die a painful death.”

Gao Qiguang cursed, feeling a burning sensation under his pants. He frantically searched for it.

When he picked up the cigarette to teach Su Nantian a lesson, his breath caught. He didn’t know when Su Nantian had arrived in front of him.

But Gao Qiguang, a useless son, was like seeing a ghost. This man moved without making a sound.

Seeing that smiling face, he felt cold all over, and his lower body went numb.
