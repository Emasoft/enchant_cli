Originally, I had thought Yang Yan's arrogance would lead him to say something extravagant, but it turned out to be music skills. Wu Lianxing's heart, which had been hanging in suspense, immediately relaxed. She was well aware of Su Nantian's mastery of the qin; otherwise, she would not have become so entranced by him.

Thinking of this, Wu Lianxing shyly glanced at Su Nantian, only to find him staring directly back at her.

Both were taken aback, then laughed.

This laughter burned Yang Yan's eyes and heart like fire.

"What are you two laughing at!" Yang Yan roared, pointing at Su Nantian and Wu Lianxing as if he had caught a pair of lovers. He raged, "Su Nantian, are you brave enough to compete with me in qin art!"

Yang Yan's heart felt as if a vinegar jar had been overturned, with fierce flames that could not be controlled. His eyes reddened as he shouted, "It's only your looks that deceived Lianxing..."

"Don't call me so affectionately," Wu Lianxing interrupted, unable to bear it. Su Nantian smiled slightly and covered his lips with his hand before clearing his throat, saying, "Apologies, Xingxing doesn't like strangers calling her so warmly."

"Xingxing!" Yang Yan shouted in frustration. Su Nantian, fearing Yang Yan might choke on his anger, saw the latter's handsome appearance gradually turn sinister.

Many female classmates who had previously liked Yang Yan retreated in fear, their admiration for him plummeting. But their opinions meant nothing to Yang Yan.

Just as he was insignificant in Wu Lianxing's eyes.

"You dare call her that!" Yang Yan hissed, "You only value Lianxing's face!"

Yang Yan roared the last sentence, attempting to portray himself as a lovesick man. Yet in the eyes of those around him, he seemed like a madman shouting nonsense.

This time, Su Nantian ignored him entirely. His indifferent gaze made Yang Yan tremble and dare not provoke further. He swallowed hard, his emotions steadied, but his thoughts stirred again.

Yang Yan thought: Su Nantian was merely a country bumpkin with brute strength. How could he understand qin art? Such refined things, he had likely never seen. In the end, Lianxing would surely separate from him.

Thinking this, Yang Yan could not contain his excitement. His mouth curled into a grin, and even his gaze at Su Nantian carried contempt.

Wu Lianxing was a person of sharp wit, having already discerned Yang Yan's intentions through his actions. She leaned close to Su Nantian and said, "Look at you, usually so low-key. Now you're being looked down upon."

Hearing Wu Lianxing's teasing, Su Nantian laughed and said, "It doesn't matter. I have the capacity to endure."

Wu Lianxing pouted,不满 said, "You can't say it that way. I'm still angry you were looked down upon."

"Alright," Su Nantian caressed Wu Lianxing's head and whispered, "Then I'll make him never dare to look down on me again."

Su Nantian lowered his head to speak to Wu Lianxing, his hot breath brushing her neck, causing her a wave of tingling. She glared at Su Nantian with a娇嗔 expression.

Seeing this, Su Nantian's actions grew bolder. He deliberately let out a heavy breath, making Wu Lianxing blush. Su Nantian said, "Then I'll win again. What reward do you have for me after returning?"

His words were soft, inaudible to others. Wu Lianxing heard clearly and said hurriedly, "You, you should win against him. What's wrong with that? I don't believe you can't match him."

Su Nantian caressed Wu Lianxing's head again.

Their manner of speaking and the movements of the chess enthusiasts were all observed by Yang Yan, causing another wave of discomfort.

"Su Nantian, now in public, don't make such intimate gestures with Lianxing. It will affect her!" Yang Yan interjected.

Su Nantian, however, paid no heed. He lifted his head from Wu Lianxing's ear and stood upright, a fierce tiger-like aura instantly surging toward Yang Yan. Yang Yan gritted his teeth and took several steps back.

Su Nantian slightly raised his chin, his eyes filled with contempt. His demeanor seemed to look down on all things.

Though it was arrogance, it felt as if Su Nantian should be like that. Only such a posture would perfectly match his aura, commanding fear without even needing to speak.

Yang Yan felt the pressure. His mind suddenly recalled how Su Nantian had beaten him into the hospital in the teahouse.

Yang Yan swallowed, his heart immediately filled with regret. He even felt some remorse for having stepped forward so recklessly.

Yang Yan's retreat was evident on his face. The surrounding crowd, who had not dispersed, observed Yang Yan's reaction. Murmurs spread.

"Look at them, is Yang Yan afraid?"

"I think he's scared too. Look at Su Nantian's aura, it's beyond ordinary people!"

"But Yang Yan isn't an ordinary person. He's quite famous in our school. This prince is handsome and his qin skills are top-notch!"

"Ah? His qin skills are top-notch, so why is he challenging Su Nantian to a qin match? It's intentional!"

"Maybe so. Yang Yan and Wu Lianxing are in the same class. I heard his qin skills were just slightly inferior to Wu Lianxing's."

After hearing this gossip, other female classmates cast strange glances at Yang Yan. Some thought he was overreaching, pretending to be brave despite his fear.

Others felt Yang Yan's heart was too malicious, intentionally challenging Su Nantian with his strengths. It was unreasonable.

But more people cast affectionate glances at Yang Yan. His family background was good, he was handsome, and his qin skills were top-notch. A prince with a slightly bad temper, they thought, was acceptable.

Though there were many murmurs, one thing was true: Yang Yan's current restrained expression was clearly overreaching. He was gambling on Su Nantian not knowing qin skills and believed he could defeat him today. Yang Yan constantly reassured himself, and his dwindling confidence rose again.

Chapter 228: Acceptance

"Enough talk," Yang Yan restrained his rising anger and growled, "Will you accept my challenge in qin art?"

The crowd immediately turned their eyes to Su Nantian, expectantly waiting for his response.

Liu Yang then frowned and stepped forward. "Yang, you're our senior. We should respect you a bit, but you're too unscrupulous. Using your strengths against our Tian's skills."

After saying this, Liu Yang looked at Su Nantian and said, "Tian, maybe don't compete. We just finished a match; it's too tiring."

Liu Yang's words were meant to give Su Nantian an exit. He deliberately spoke loudly, reminding everyone that Su Nantian had just finished a match.

Su Nantian naturally understood Liu Yang's concern, but this lack of trust made Su Nantian reluctant to accept. He stepped forward and patted Liu Yang's shoulder, saying, "If others don't trust me, that's fine. But you've followed me all day; do you have no faith in my abilities?"

Liu Yang was stunned, then sighed with a sad face and whispered, "Tian, I know your abilities. But this is qin art, not physical strength. This Yang Yan has practiced for years; you'll definitely lose against him."

"You haven't seen me play the qin, so how do you know I'll lose?" Su Nantian patted Liu Yang's shoulder again, his determined gaze making it impossible for Liu Yang to move.

Liu Yang nodded reluctantly and slowly returned to stand behind Su Nantian.

Su Nantian looked at Yang Yan before him and coldly said, "I accept your challenge again. But know this: it's the last time. If you lose, hide all those inappropriate thoughts properly."

"Never let them show again, or I'll eradicate you completely." After saying this, Su Nantian didn't look at Yang Yan again and turned to leave. Wu Lianxing also did not spare a glance at Yang Yan, and when she saw Su Nantian turn, she hurriedly ran to his right side.

Everyone was stunned by Su Nantian's natural aura, as if the match hadn't even started and he had already won.

"Ah... Su Nantian is so handsome. The woman who gets his care must be very happy," a female classmate behind Yang Yan sighed.

This statement deeply stimulated Yang Yan. He rushed toward Su Nantian's back and shouted, "Meet me in the qin room an hour later!"

After saying this, Yang Yan turned and left angrily. His back seemed to radiate fire, contrasting with Su Nantian's calmness.

As the crowd dispersed, many secretly agreed to meet at the qin room an hour later.

Su Nantian led Wu Lianxing and Gao Jingjing into the rest room to collect their belongings.

As soon as Gao Jingjing entered the rest room, she quickly tidied Su Nantian's belongings into his bag. Wu Lianxing sat on the side, watching Su Nantian and said, "You don't have a qin at school. Fortunately, I brought mine today. Don't worry about anyone tampering with it; you can use mine this afternoon."

"Okay," Su Nantian replied. He turned to help Gao Jingjing tidy up, and the two quickly packed everything. Gao Jingjing neatly folded Su Nantian's clothes.

However, the Gao brothers had no such luck. The men picked up towels and clothes on the floor and stuffed them into their bags without folding, leaving them crumpled.

He Tao's arm was sore and lacked strength. He could only use the uninjured side to tidy up, so his progress was left behind by others. He Tao watched Su Nantian and teased, "Wow, Tian, it's good to have a girl take care of you. You finished so quickly."

Su Nantian was stretching his arms when He Tao teased him, and he turned to look at He Tao who was hunched over picking up towels. "You have time for jokes. You already have one arm injured; hurry and tidy up, be the last to lock the door."

He Tao gasped, no longer responding to Su Nantian. His speed gradually increased, muttering, "What's the point? That door is so heavy; pulling it down, my other hand is also useless."

The Gao brothers exchanged a smile and laughed at He Tao. "You're really easy to trick. Tian had already told us to lock the door last, so what are you afraid of?"

He Tao's face turned red as he defended himself. "Who said I was scared? I'm just injured!"

He Tao glared at them and turned to find something, only to spot Cao Yun at the door. His eyes lit up. He Tao dropped the items in his hands onto a chair and hurriedly ran to Cao Yun's side, asking, "Why are you back? How is Song Jin?"

At this moment, Su Nantian and the others noticed Cao Yun standing at the door.

Gao Jingjing was startled and quickly approached, saying, "Come in. Don't stand at the door."

Cao Yun, pulled into the rest room by He Tao and Gao Jingjing, felt awkward. She rubbed her neck and smiled, "Song Jin has finished treatment; the school has already paid for it. I think there's nothing wrong, so I didn't disturb Song Jin's parents and came back."

After hearing Cao Yun's account, everyone relaxed. Su Nantian nodded and said, "You've worked hard. Rest a bit."

Cao Yun pressed her lips together and then smiled, nodding with an expression of joy. Her eyes unintentionally flicked to Wu Lianxing and Gao Jingjing by Su Nantian's side.

Wu Lianxing met Cao Yun's gaze and was initially stunned. The next moment, she smiled and waved at Cao Yun.

Soon, several girls gathered together and started talking animatedly. They laughed and chatted happily.

Their eyes often glanced at someone, wondering what they were thinking inside.

Soon, the boys had collected most of their belongings. The items on the floor were all picked up and thrown into the trash.

Seeing that the cleanliness was almost done, several girls took out mineral water and passed it around.

When Liu Yang and others received the water from the goddess-like figures, their fatigue disappeared instantly. They felt as if they had endless strength.

They immediately started chatting with them, their smiles looking even more joyful than the victory they had just achieved.

Su Nantian shook his head in无奈 and said nothing.

He walked toward the door.

Though several girls had left Su Nantian's side, their attention was always on him and never left.

Chapter 229: My Brother is Amazing

Seeing Su Nantian about to leave, they immediately said goodbye to He Tao, Liu Yang, and the Gao brothers. They ran after him.

This made them envious and jealous.

The two Gao brothers pulled the door down from top to bottom and used a key to lock it properly.

After finishing these tasks, Su Nantian looked at the people before him and said, "Today's volleyball match was completed very well. You brought honor to the class and earned applause."

"I'm glad that because of this opportunity, I could play with you. I hope this experience will be remembered by all of you for the next four years of university life."

Liu Yang awkwardly rubbed his head and said, "Ah, Tian, what you said is a bit sentimental. It feels like a farewell. I tell you, Tian, we'll follow you from now on. You can't abandon us."

He Tao and the others nodded in agreement.

"We are classmates, so it's not like following you," Su Nantian said with no emotion. But having spent a day with these boys, they all understood Su Nantian's personality.

They didn't want to cling too tightly. However, these people, including Song Jin in the hospital, had secretly decided that from now on, they would follow Su Nantian without question.

This feeling and determination were deeply embedded in their hearts, never fading for a long time.

"Alright," Su Nantian said. "The match is over. Everyone go back and change, rest a bit. There's military training tomorrow; don't be late."

Liu Yang rubbed the back of his head, somewhat confused. "But Tian, you've already made a match with Yang Yan, right? There's only forty minutes left. We should go together to watch."

"Match?" Cao Yun exclaimed, "What match? The match has already ended. Wait, with whom? Yang Yan?"

Cao Yun's eyes widened in disbelief and asked, "It's only been a few days since school started. How many matches have you had? This one is also Yang Yan? What are you two competing in?"

"Qin art!" He Tao laughed joyfully, showing his two small fangs.

"Talkative," Su Nantian glanced at He Tao slightly, but seeing Cao Yun's questioning gaze, he nodded.

Cao Yun immediately widened her eyes. After a long time, she realized that such an outstanding person could play the qin was nothing strange.

But deep down, she hoped Su Nantian wouldn't be so outstanding because the more outstanding he was, the less chance she had.

The gap between them grew larger, making her lose confidence.

Wu Lianxing saw Cao Yun's surprised expression and smiled with her eyes.

"Su Nantian is even better at qin art than me. Don't underestimate him, okay."

"How could that be?"

Everyone exclaimed in surprise. To have Wu Lianxing personally praise him and clearly say Su Nantian was better than her.

After all, Wu Lianxing was a very talented qin player at Fengyue University and had been accepted as a disciple by Fang Lao.

Wu Lianxing's smile was like a chrysanthemum, making people intoxicated.

Cao Yun felt as if struck by lightning. She looked at Wu Lianxing and then Su Nantian, and they really were a perfect match.

She knew her hope was almost impossible. Even if Su Nantian agreed, she had no confidence because there were many more outstanding and beautiful people around Su Nantian.

Liu Yang, He Tao, and others looked at Su Nantian as if he were a monster.

He was truly inhuman.

His combat strength was already high, but now he had this talent. They had no skills except for their family's money, which was nothing compared to him. Perhaps that money meant nothing to Su Nantian.

Such a powerful person definitely didn't lack money. From Gao Jingjing and Wu Lianxing, it was clear that Su Nantian wasn't ordinary. Who could have so many top female students constantly surrounding one person?

Never before, Su Nantian was the first and maybe the last.

Liu Yang suddenly laughed, "That Yang Yan is really looking for death. He didn't know our Tian had such skills. It's like walking into a gun barrel."

He Tao nodded quickly, "There's no problem with Tian's strength. Even ten Yang Yans aren't enough to compare, they're just trash."

Others also nodded in agreement. Their eyes looked at Su Nantian with envy, and their expressions were complex.

Gao Jingjing covered her mouth and smiled. "This door is wrong, but Yang Yan is also one of the top in school. Even if he's so strong, he's not a match for Nantian."

"You're right. I'm already eager to see how he'll lose." Liu Yang smiled and took two steps forward.

Gao Jingjing pretended to cover her nose, looking around at everyone.

"You all smell..."

"Ah!" Liu Yang shouted and hurriedly took his bag towards the dormitory. He ran while shouting, "We'll go take a shower; we'll meet at the qin room later!"

Others also rushed out like lightning, not wanting to be left behind. They gradually disappeared from their sight.

After Gao Jingjing's teasing, the four men immediately went back to their dorms and quickly washed off the sweat.

Although Su Nantian had also exercised, he didn't smell bad and was very fragrant.

Cao Yun felt awkward and glanced at Su Nantian. Her mind told her she should leave, but for some reason, after seeing Su Nantian, her feet couldn't move.

Cao Yun didn't leave. Su Nantian and Gao Jingjing, Wu Lianxing just silently stood by her side. The four of them stared at each other for a while, and Su Nantian asked, "What are you going to do next?"

Cao Yun was startled and stammered, "I... I have nothing else to do. I don't know where to go."

Seeing Cao Yun's confusion, "Then come with us. We'll see how Su Nantian defeats them."

Gao Jingjing smiled and stepped forward, taking Cao Yun's hand.

Gao Jingjing's kind attitude immediately made two red spots appear on Cao Yun's face. She felt awkward and rubbed her nose.

Gao Jingjing's words were like a lifeline thrown to someone drowning. Cao Yun quickly took the opportunity, "Okay, okay! Let's go to the qin room together!"

As long as it didn't waste time, Su Nantian didn't mind having people around him. At that moment, the four of them slowly walked towards the qin room.

Along the way, this handsome man and three women attracted everyone's attention. The man was handsome and tall, like Apollo from Greek mythology. His eyebrows and eyes were filled with a faint aura of immortality.

The three women by his side each had their own charm. One was a tall and elegant lady, another an alluring young woman, and the third a gentle neighbor girl.

Chapter 230: Taking the Qin

This journey naturally attracted countless glances, with people whispering about this man and three women.

Some girls wanted to rush forward to greet them, exchange contact information, or at least say a few words. It would be enough for her to brag about it for days.

Fortunately, they were held back by their girlfriends and no scandal occurred.

Under Wu Lianxing's guidance, the group took several small paths and arrived at the door of the qin room in a few minutes.

After opening the door, the three women were stunned. Even Su Nantian raised an eyebrow.

Inside the qin room, it was densely packed with people. Except for the stage where a qin stand and chair were left, even outside the window had people standing on tiptoe to look in.

Wu Lianxing also raised an eyebrow. She had never seen so many people come to watch her before, and it was only a short time. Su Nantian's popularity had already surpassed hers, which was quite exaggerated.

Seeing Su Nantian appear, the crowd erupted in cheers. Many female fans shouted "Tian" loudly and waved fluorescent signs.

Many people rushed toward Su Nantian, wanting to give him a close hug and let him feel their love.

Wu Lianxing and the others watched the crowd rushing toward them and shook their heads. They didn't want to be squashed into a meat pie.

Without thinking, they moved closer to Su Nantian.

What surprised them was that the people stopped at a distance of one zhang from Su Nantian and could not move forward even an inch.

The female fans tried their best but couldn't get closer, and they were all confused. However, they didn't give up and kept pushing toward Su Nantian desperately.

Wu Lianxing and the others watched this strange scene, all widening their eyes. This was definitely Su Nantian's doing.

Cao Yun couldn't believe it and looked around, watching the female fans rushing toward them.

Wu Lianxing quickly realized it and greeted people she knew in the crowd.

Under Su Nantian's guidance, they walked smoothly to the stage.

Cao Yun and Gao Jingjing looked at these crazy fans but ultimately didn't go on stage. They默契ly stood under the stage.

While Su Nantian and Wu Lianxing, this handsome man and beautiful woman, stepped onto the stage.

Su Nantian didn't rush to urge Wu Lianxing but instead stood with his hands in his pockets, looking at her.

The female fans on the stage looked at Su Nantian and felt jealous and envious.

This man so handsome that it was suffocating had not even looked at them, leaving them disappointed but unable to resist.

Wu Lianxing finished greeting everyone and playfully stuck out her tongue at Su Nantian. She took out a bright small key from her bag and walked toward the large safe in the center of the stage.

The murmurs below the stage began.

"Wow, look at Wu Lianxing's goddess; is she giving her qin to Su Nantian?"

"Is that true? They're so close!"

"Today at noon I saw Wu Lianxing's qin, and now I can see it again in the afternoon. How lucky!"

The crowd below was full of anticipation. In the morning, Wu Lianxing's qin had moved people, but the distance was too far. They had never seen clearly what she played on that qin.

"Hey, do you know? I heard Wu Lianxing's qin isn't an ordinary one on the market," Gao Jingjing's two girls behind her started to chat happily.

"Is that true? How so?" Another girl asked.

"I heard Wu Lianxing's qin was excavated from a royal concubine's tomb by an archaeological team decades ago. It was buried in the coffin of that concubine! When the archaeologists opened the coffin, the qin suddenly made a sound!"

"Ah?" The girl who asked interrupted, her face changed. She said, "That's so unlucky. It was placed next to a dead person; it must have been polluted by corpse oil!"

"Hey, I heard that the concubine had a pearl in her mouth. When they opened the coffin, she looked like she was sleeping and showed no signs of decay!"

Many girls had heard this and covered their mouths in shock.

"What's this? An antique! How come it's with Wu Lianxing?"

The girl thought for a moment and answered hesitantly, "It seems that the qin was obtained by Fang Lao in the music world. I heard he sold all his assets to get this qin."

"Later, Fang Lao achieved a new peak with this qin. Now that he's no longer interested in worldly matters, he gave the qin to Wu Lianxing."

There was a faint understanding among the crowd. A girl said, "Wu Lianxing is Fang Lao's student; it's natural for her to be given this qin."

Another round of affirmations. Gao Jingjing listened to the whole thing and kept a calm smile on her face.

Cao Yun was interested in this matter. She looked at Gao Jingjing and bit her lip, asking, "Senior, you seem to get along well with Wu Lianxing. What do you think of what I just heard?"

As if she had anticipated Cao Yun's question, Gao Jingjing smiled and turned to her. "Whether it's true or not doesn't matter. After all, this qin is in Lianxing's hands, and we are fortunate to hear its beauty."

Gao Jingjing's words were like a revelation for Cao Yun. She stopped listening to the noise behind her and focused on the stage, staring at Wu Lianxing's figure without blinking.

Wu Lianxing walked to the safe in the center of the stage. The safe seemed to sense Wu Lianxing's arrival and emitted a ring of silver light. Wu Lianxing first gently caressed the top of the safe, then inserted the key she held into the lock.

With a "click," the code was entered, and the thick door of the safe opened with a soft sound.

Whether it was psychological or not, the crowd's heartbeats reached a climax.

Wu Lianxing bent down and carefully lifted the long qin with both hands, then turned around. Everyone's eyes immediately focused on this long qin.

Time had left no traces on this qin. The archaeologists had studied the material of this qin for half a year, identifying it as premium sheep fat jade. The preservation was astonishing.

This jade qin was three feet five inches and six cun long. Each of the seven strings emitted a sharp light, directly piercing people's vision. Su Nantian, although not comparable to ordinary people, had never seen this qin before.

Chapter 231: How Could It Be Like This

At the first sight of this qin, Su Nantian felt something was attracting him.

Then he was greatly shocked because he could not see through it, feeling as if he were about to be sucked in.

Wu Lianxing gently placed the long qin, radiating a warm and elegant aura, into Su Nantian's hands.

At this moment, Su Nantian finally broke free from it.

The heavy and ancient qin no longer had that strange feeling.

Su Nantian didn't think much more. He carefully placed the qin on the qin stand.

Wu Lianxing turned and smiled at Su Nantian, then slowly walked down to the stage. She stood with Gao Jingjing.

There were only ten minutes left until the match, but Yang Yan had still not arrived.

Su Nantian didn't rush. He gently placed his hands on the seven strings of the qin stand, trying to see through it.

The crowd below was not happy.

Those who had bet on Yang Yan's victory were also grumbling.

Their thoughts turned, was he running away?

They all looked gloomy and found Su Nantian more annoying.

They discussed Yang Yan, who had not yet appeared.

Su Nantian ignored it and sat quietly in front of the ancient qin.

He extended his hands, gently covering the seven strings.

The crowd watched Su Nantian's actions and held their breath, anxiously watching his next move.

Su Nantian slightly curled his fingers. His ring finger was already at the junction of two strings, and he gently plucked one, producing a clear and loud sound that lingered in the qin room.

The crowd was stunned by this sound, as if they had returned to a distant dynasty.

Zhong Ziqi and Bo Ya's high mountains and flowing water seemed to appear before them.

Gao Jingjing was also stunned. After recovering, she elbowed Wu Lianxing and smiled, "I haven't heard this qin before. It's such a good one. Even if I go up, I might win against that Yang Yan."

Wu Lianxing shook her head at the compliment. Regarding qin art, Wu Lianxing was very serious. She said, "This qin is indeed good, but it depends on who uses it. Like the one you just heard, although everyone thinks it's a simple action, the strength and timing are difficult to master."

"Only by truly mastering this balance can one play a piece that highlights the qin's beauty." Wu Lianxing explained in detail, and even Cao Yun, who was not very skilled in music theory, nodded repeatedly.

Su Nantian paid no attention to the events below the stage and continued to familiarize himself with this qin. He plucked a few more strings, and his satisfaction with the beautiful music of this qin grew.

"Good qin," Su Nantian praised without hesitation. He looked at Wu Lianxing with a glance and smiled, mouthing thanks to her.

Wu Lianxing blushed slightly and looked at Su Nantian with a shy expression, then lowered her head again.

Cao Yun tightly pressed her lips. She watched Wu Lianxing and Su Nantian's interaction, feeling some resentment but helplessly.

Su Nantian on the stage was like a deity, radiating an irresistible aura. Cao Yun became more certain that men like Su Nantian could only be matched by goddesses.

Everyone was entranced by Su Nantian's charm and couldn't resist. They had almost forgotten about Yang Yan not coming.

Five minutes before the match, the door of the qin room finally opened. Yang Yan carried a long qin wrapped in black cloth, his face filled with a gloomy expression mixed with a hint of mockery.

The crowd immediately made way for Yang Yan. He seemed not to see them and walked directly onto the stage. When he passed Wu Lianxing, his eyebrows furrowed slightly and stopped, saying to Wu Lianxing, "I'll make you understand."

"What do you mean?" Wu Lianxing rolled her eyes unkindly.

"I'm doing it for your good," Yang Yan explained anxiously, "A person like Su Nantian is shallow and doesn't deserve you. Only I can..."

Before he could finish, Yang Yan felt something strike his face. A sharp pain made him shout in surprise. Even Wu Lianxing and Gao Jingjing were startled by Yang Yan's sudden shout.

Gao Jingjing frowned, "What are you yelling for? You scared everyone. What kind of behavior is that?"

Yang Yan touched the painful spot on his face and suddenly felt a thin silver needle. His breath immediately quickened, and he carefully pulled it out, holding it in front of Wu Lianxing to explain, "No, I didn't mean to. It's this needle!"

Wu Lianxing naturally recognized it as Su Nantian's silver needle. She exchanged a glance with Gao Jingjing, and both realized what had happened.

It was likely that Su Nantian had personally taught Yang Yan a lesson.

Sure enough, the silver needle in Yang Yan's hand was taken by a pair of long hands. Su Nantian held the needle and examined it carefully before coldly saying, "Sorry, the silver needle was disobedient. It took a walk and bumped into your face."

After saying this, Su Nantian didn't care about Yang Yan's reaction. He took out the cloth bag that had wrapped the silver needle from somewhere and inserted the needle into it. He casually placed it, and the bag seemed to vanish behind Su Nantian.

This made everyone in the crowd laugh. Wu Lianxing couldn't help but smile, "This needle is quite spiritual; it knows how to punish the wicked."

Yang Yan's face twisted in anger. He didn't want to scold Wu Lianxing but redirected his fire toward Su Nantian, "You're treating everyone as fools. How could a silver needle take a walk on its own? You clearly used the silver needle to attack me!"

Su Nantian turned back to the qin stand and glanced at Yang Yan, saying, "You can't say that. Cows can fly in your mouth; so it's no problem for the silver needle to take a walk in my hand."

Before Yang Yan could respond, Su Nantian said, "If you don't come up, I'll consider it as a forfeit."

Yang Yan glared at him and looked at the clock on the qin room. It was only two minutes until an hour had passed.

He quickly carried his long qin and sat at his qin stand, placing the black-wrapped long qin carefully on the stand. He cast a contemptuous glance at Su Nantian.

But when Yang Yan's eyes swept over the long qin before Su Nantian, his eyes widened and he almost jumped up. He pointed at the glowing jade qin before Su Nantian and said, "Lianxing actually gave her beloved qin to you?"

Chapter 232: The Bet

Su Nantian raised an eyebrow and said, "What else? We're not strangers."

"Don't be shameless!" Yang Yan roared, his eyes darkening further.
