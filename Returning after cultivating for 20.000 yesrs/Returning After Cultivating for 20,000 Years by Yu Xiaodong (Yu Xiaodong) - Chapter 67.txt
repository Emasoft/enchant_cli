Tian Ke pondered why Lan Bao had attacked him, realizing that the latter was also a lecher. He quickly added, "Tiger Brother, he's coming over! Fight him, Tiger Brother, teach him a lesson and slap his face!"

At this moment, Lan Bao had completely lost hope. He had previously been punished by Su Nan Tian with bamboo sticks for gazing at Yue Xiaoshan's beauty. He had hoped to avoid trouble by staying out of their sight, but two days later, he was caught again by Su Nan Tian. He could only lament that the world was too small.

Tian Ke watched Su Nan Tian approaching him directly and screamed, "Tiger Brother, he's coming! Fight him, Tiger Brother, teach him a lesson and slap his face!"

Even the students at a distance had noticed something amiss, but Tian Ke was too stunned by Su Nan Tian's attack to think clearly. He continued fervently shouting, "Tiger Brother, hit him, Tiger Brother!"

"Are you two?" Su Nan Tian asked mockingly.

Lan Bao quickly raised his hands, silently indicating he had done nothing and knew nothing.

"Hit him."

Su Nan Tian spoke two plain words. In the presence of only the three of them, everyone understood what it meant—Lan Bao included.

Chapter 322: The Surprising Twist

He glanced at Tian Ke, who had been so thoroughly tricked. He mentally prayed it wasn't his fault—just that the enemy was too变态. He begged heaven to forgive him, insisting it wasn't because he, Lan Bao, lacked loyalty.

Crack!

A crisp slap echoed through the hall. Tian Ke, still shouting, suddenly received another slap. Even if he respected Lan Bao, he couldn't bear the humiliation.

"Lan Bao! What the hell are you doing? I told you to hit this useless bodyguard, not me!"

"I'm hitting you! What bodyguard? He's Tian Ge! Why did you provoke this demon?"

Lan Bao quickly covered Tian Ke's mouth to prevent him from spouting more words that might anger Su Nan Tian.

"Can you handle this yourself?"

Su Nan Tian was annoyed by Tian Ke's words and frowned at Lan Bao.

"Uh... what do you mean?"

After saying this, Lan Bao immediately regretted it. He looked at Su Nan Tian's amused expression and felt a bad premonition.

"Since you don't know, then so be it. You two just slap each other here."

Su Nan Tian's mischievous side flared up. He smiled darkly at Lan Bao and the still clueless Tian Ke.

"Okay!"

Lan Bao thought for a moment. Between face and life, he chose life and slapped Tian Ke's face again.

Tian Ke, repeatedly slapped by Lan Bao's rugged face, couldn't hide the red handprint despite his heavy makeup.

As he was furious about losing face, Lan Bao suddenly grabbed his collar and shouted, "Hit me!"

Not only Tian Ke and Yang Dong were stunned, but even Yue Xiaoshan's classmates were speechless. Some streetwise people knew Lan Bao was a ruthless character, but why did he become so submissive before Su Nan Tian?

They looked at Su Nan Tian with fear, dreading he might retaliate for their earlier attack.

But Su Nan Tian wasn't that petty. This class reunion, which he had anticipated with excitement, had become tainted by status and power—boring.

"Garfield, do your job!"

He left this remark before turning to pull Yue Xiaoshan away without wasting time.

Garfield?

Hearing Su Nan Tian call Lan Bao by this strange name, the classmates almost lost their minds. Was this the power of a bodyguard?

Only after Su Nan Tian and Yue Xiaoshan had left far away did Lan Bao and Tian Ke stop.

Seeing Tian Ke's swollen, indistinct face, the classmates burst into pig-like laughter.

Tian Ke glared at them before asking Lan Bao, "Tiger Brother, what's going on? Why are you afraid of that little bodyguard?"

If Tian Ke still didn't understand, he was truly foolish. But he was just as curious as the classmates: why would the legendary Lan Bao fear a mere bodyguard?

"Go to hell, bodyguard. Do you really not know or are you pretending?"

Lan Bao glared at Tian Ke's stubbornness, almost wanting to fall asleep. Why did this guy always act like he was clueless?

"Know what?"

Tian Ke asked blankly, but his purple-red cheeks had no cuteness—only annoyance in Lan Bao's eyes.

"He's not a bodyguard. Do you know who that woman is?"

Lan Bao rubbed his numb face and asked slowly.

"She's just a minor employee at Xin Yue Group. What's so special about that?"

Tian Ke shrugged, though positions at Xin Yue Group were hard to get. But Yue Xiaoshan's status as a minor employee was still far behind his big company boss.

"You're lying. I'll tell you, the woman you tried to flirt with is actually Xin Yue Group's current CEO—Yue Xiaoshan!"

Hearing those titles before Yue Xiaoshan's name, Tian Ke almost dropped his eyes. He never imagined that the woman they had speculated about was Xin Yue Group's mysterious CEO.

After Lan Bao confirmed it, the classmates who had attacked Su Nan Tian regretted their intestines. Compared to Tian Ke's company worth millions, it was unworthy of even cleaning their shoes.

If they hadn't broken the fight, maybe they could have obtained her help under the guise of classmates and ascended directly. But now this opportunity was ruined by Tian Ke, a talentless man who loved boasting. Looking at him with anger, they felt more irritation.

However, Tian Ke didn't notice their looks. He was still lost in the terror of Yue Xiaoshan's identity.

He had heard about Xin Yue Group's mysterious CEO, but now he had provoked her. With Xin Yue Group's strength, she could destroy his small company with just a word.

It must be said that Tian Ke's worry was unnecessary, because Yue Xiaoshan wouldn't waste a word on such trash.

"Where's that dead bodyguard? How could the CEO be with him?"

Tian Ke suddenly remembered and asked unwillingly.

Lan Bao sighed, exasperated. "I don't know where you heard he was a regular bodyguard. Let me tell you, his real identity is Xin Yue Group's personal security. How powerful he is, you can judge yourself."

Hearing this, Tian Ke's face turned grim. He had never heard of such a thing before. Yue Xiaoshan, who was always cold as an iceberg, would let a man be her personal security. There must be something fishy.

"Moreover, Su Nan Tian isn't just a strong fighter. Two days ago, I and Chang Lian with others used knives, bats, and pipes but couldn't beat him alone."

Lan Bao recalled the fear Su Nan Tian had instilled in them. He sighed at Tian Ke, who was now hopelessly lost.

Tian Ke was stunned. The other classmates didn't bother to talk to him, and even his sycophant Wang Dong was avoiding him.

Chapter 323: Ambushed on the Way

At the same time, Yue Xiaoshan sat in the car, recalling Tian Ke and Lan Bao slapping each other. She couldn't help but laugh.

"Hey, I didn't expect you to be so serious. You made them slap each other. That's a cruel trick."

"I, serious? Have you never seen me being unserious?"

Su Nan Tian asked with a mischievous smile, making Yue Xiaoshan blush.

"Hey, if you keep being so mouthy, I'll stop talking to you."

Yue Xiaoshan said after thinking for a while. She didn't even believe her own threat, but Su Nan Tian truly said nothing more.

"What's wrong? I was just joking. Did you take it seriously?"

Yue Xiaoshan thought her joke had gone too far, looking at Su Nan Tian's gloomy face. She felt anxious—had her words implied something distant?

She had always been indifferent to worldly matters and didn't understand human warmth. Maybe she really would make people dislike her with some words.

"Shh, don't be sad. I'm not talking because we seem to have trouble. It's nothing to do with you."

Su Nan Tian, seeing Yue Xiaoshan's sad expression, said with a bitter smile.

"Trouble? What trouble?"

Hearing Su Nan Tian didn't care about her words, Yue Xiaoshan's face returned to normal.

"Unknown. But there's a dangerous feeling."

The weather was turning from summer to autumn, and Su Nan Tian's car was on a road with few people. He sensed something strange—a dangerous smell.

Su Nan Tian wanted to slow down, but it was too late. Suddenly, a black spherical object rolled in front of their car. Su Nan Tian's pupils widened.

"Fasten your seatbelt!"

He shouted, trying to steer away from the small ball. But it was too late. Before he could turn the wheel completely, the ball had already rolled in front of their car.

Crack!

At the moment the wheels were about to crush it, the ball made a crisp sound. The sphere exploded like an octopus, extending several metal spikes with thorns. They formed a net that covered the two front wheels.

Squeal!

Due to intense friction with the ground, the wheels were pierced by these metal spikes, emitting a piercing sound.

Su Nan Tian, after the brakes and steering failed, immediately decided to abandon the car. He grabbed the startled Yue Xiaoshan and jumped out of the window without hesitation.

The商务车 he was driving slid forward dozens of meters, crashing into a tree. The front driver's seat instantly crumbled.

Looking at the destroyed商务车 in the distance, Su Nan Tian's gaze turned serious. Clearly, the enemy's method was to kill him and Yue Xiaoshan. Who could have such hatred against them?

Su Nan Tian first thought of Tian Ke, but then realized he wouldn't be so foolish. If he wanted to attack him, he wouldn't have staged that scene with Lan Bao. Was it enemies from Yue's family or enemies he had provoked?

Thinking of this possibility, Su Nan Tian felt uneasy. If it was Yue's enemies, it would be manageable. But if his enemies found them here and killed them, the consequences would be much worse.

He had faced some extremely变态 people before. Compared to these small fish in Jiangcheng, they were on a different level. And now he had Yue Xiaoshan with him—how could he deal with hidden killers?

As Su Nan Tian was scanning the area for a place to hide Yue Xiaoshan, he suddenly felt a dangerous aura. He instinctively turned his body, and a bullet almost grazed his sleeve.

"Damn it, he's carrying a gun?"

Su Nan Tian cursed. His eyes directly targeted the balcony of an old apartment building more than ten meters above him. With his combat experience, he could definitely tell the enemy was there.

"Hey, who are you? Why do you want to kill us?"

Su Nan Tian shouted at the building. His only goal now was to stabilize the enemy and prevent another shot. He could withstand it, but Yue Xiaoshan couldn't.

Bang!

But the only answer was a sniper shot. Fortunately, the enemy's shooting wasn't particularly skilled; otherwise, at such close range, Su Nan Tian wouldn't have had time to react.

"Can't let Yue Xiaoshan's safety be compromised."

Su Nan Tian quickly thought of a strategy. His two pupils calculated like machines, swiftly finding a blind spot in the enemy's sniper position.

Then he cupped Yue Xiaoshan's frightened face and hurriedly said, "No time to explain. I'll take you behind that house now. Hide and don't come out no matter what!"

After saying this, he pulled Yue Xiaoshan's hand and ran towards an abandoned public toilet across the street. Yue Xiaoshan didn't care about her ladylike image and let him pull her.

But their running made them targets. Fortunately, Su Nan Tian's senses were very sharp, and his years of combat experience weren't in vain. Every time the enemy shot from above, he could sense it beforehand and quickly dodge.

But Su Nan Tian wasn't just a victim. How could he let the enemy beat him? As he ran, he secretly flipped his hand and waved it.

A sharp sound of breaking air echoed in front of him. The enemy on the rooftop felt a flash before his eyes and quickly fired one shot, then hid behind a pile of empty boxes.

"Is this Tangmen's hidden weapon? If hit, the body would be pierced like a sieve."

The rooftop killer recognized what Su Nan Tian had thrown. His calm eyes flickered with waves, and he felt a bit regretful—unexpectedly, his position was exposed so quickly.

At the same time, Su Nan Tian saw a flash of fire on the top of the abandoned apartment building and quickly crouched down, muttering to himself. If this continued, if he couldn't find a way to make the enemy surrender, he would eventually be exhausted.

At this moment, Su Nan Tian's ability as a cultivator was maximized. He quickly scanned the structure of the apartment building where the killer was located, which was very complex. He knew he had to get close to the enemy.

Chapter 324: Confrontation

His eyes narrowed. Seeing that the opponent on the rooftop was motionless, it seemed he had been intimidated by his hidden weapon or was observing secretly. Regardless, he couldn't wait anymore.

"Xiaoshan, stay here. I'll kill him!"

He told Yue Xiaoshan and seized the opportunity to jump out, rushing towards the old apartment building. He leaped high into the air and landed on the balcony behind the opponent.

"Ha, I didn't expect you to hide so deep!"

Su Nan Tian said with a cold laugh as he reached the killer's back.

Hearing Su Nan Tian's laughter, the killer's eyes widened. But in just one second, he realized the situation and quickly turned around, aiming and shooting again.

Bang!

But Su Nan Tian was faster. At the moment the killer shot, he dodged and grabbed the opponent's hot gun barrel. The bullet hit the left wall, kicking up dust.

Feeling the heat on his palm, Su Nan Tian didn't mind. He wouldn't let the opponent have another chance to shoot. Quickly, he extended his other hand and punched the opponent's waist.

The killer had both hands on the gun, so to prevent Su Nan Tian from ambushing him, he was forced to use one hand to block the attack. This was exactly what Su Nan Tian had planned. His feint punch suddenly changed direction, and he grabbed the opponent's gun.

"Surprised?"

Su Nan Tian played with the opponent's sniper rifle, laughing.

Seeing his gun taken, the killer's eyes flickered with surprise. He clearly knew that being disarmed meant mission failure.

As he prepared to escape, he suddenly noticed Yue Xiaoshan alone and hiding below. A cold smile crossed his lips.

"Bad!"

Su Nan Tian sensed something unusual from the killer's smile and immediately dropped the rifle, jumping down with the killer. They both landed on the ground, glaring at each other.

Su Nan Tian examined the opponent before him. Dressed in black, his clothes fluttered without wind. His expression was filled with sinister energy—clearly a ruthless killer.

"Hey, kid, who's your employer?"

Su Nan Tian thought of asking to test the opponent's identity. At least he needed to know where the enemy came from.

"Too many questions."

The opponent let out a low growl. He suddenly pushed off the ground like a sword, rushing towards Su Nan Tian.

"Hey, what did I say!"

Su Nan Tian suddenly remembered the killer's rule: never betray your employer. Seeing the opponent rushing towards him with a fist, he let out a cold laugh and extended one hand to block the black-cloaked man's attack.

Swish!

At the moment their fists were about to collide, for some reason, the black-cloaked killer suddenly withdrew his fist halfway and wiped both hands to his waist. A metal fan unfolded like magic in his hand.

The next second, the fan's bones opened, and sharp blades directly aimed at Su Nan Tian's chest.

"What kind of move is this?"

Su Nan Tian complained after seeing the deadly thrust. He decided to take the initiative and spread his arms, exposing all his weaknesses so the opponent wouldn't catch him off guard.

The killer saw Su Nan Tian's surrender and instinctively thought he would give up. His fan didn't hesitate, sending the sharp blade towards Su Nan Tian's chest.

But Su Nan Tian wouldn't give the killer a chance to kill him. Suddenly, his eyes narrowed and he extended one hand to grab the opponent's slender wrist.

The killer was stunned to find that his hand, which had been grabbed by Su Nan Tian, could no longer exert any strength. Even escaping was difficult. He secretly marveled at Su Nan Tian's terrifying power.

He certainly wouldn't give up so easily. He immediately planted one foot on the ground and kicked Su Nan Tian's waist with the other leg.

Su Nan Tian was startled. The power of this kick was extremely strong; if it hit him, it wouldn't be a joke. He quickly extended his other hand to grab the opponent's black clothes and pushed forward, throwing the killer out.

In mid-air, Su Nan Tian looked into the man's eyes and was greatly shocked. What kind of eyes were these? There was no light at all, as if a robot, cold and emotionless. His eyes were filled with shadows of killing.

The killer did several flips in mid-air and landed smoothly. His curiosity was no less than Su Nan Tian's. This method of breaking the kick wasn't something everyone knew.

"Hey, killer brother, how about this? We fight, but don't touch the woman behind me."

Su Nan Tian noticed that the killer's eyes kept drifting toward Yue Xiaoshan's hiding place. He instinctively blocked his view and negotiated.

He could withstand the opponent's attack, but that didn't mean Yue Xiaoshan would escape unscathed. Did the opponent's target not him, but Yue Xiaoshan?

This thought had just formed in his mind when the killer's body instantly disappeared. When he regained his senses, the killer had already bypassed him and rushed toward Yue Xiaoshan, who was completely defenseless.

"Damn it, you crazy bastard!"

Su Nan Tian cursed the opponent's words and immediately pushed off the ground. He jumped up and kicked the killer's back.

Bang!

Another闷响, Su Nan Tian felt his attack was blocked by a light object. The killer had used the fan from behind to block his leg, and the opponent's arm was in an odd twisted state. After he landed, it instantly returned to normal.

"Wow, this guy's body skills are so strong. It's the opposite of Zhang An's strength. This is taking flexibility and stretchiness to the extreme."

Su Nan Tian's pupils widened, quickly releasing his foot and exclaiming "monster." Playing with a fan was one thing, but this arm's flexibility must have broken bones.

He naturally knew that cultivating the body required immense pain. That was why the opponent's eyes had no vitality.

"Go away!"

Feeling Su Nan Tian's strange gaze, the killer's eyes suddenly shot out a cold light. Su Nan Tian didn't show fear and glared back, then subtly blocked the opponent's path.

"Your target isn't me, it's Yue Xiaoshan, right?"

Su Nan Tian asked again.

Chapter 325: The Situation is Under Control

Hearing his words, Yue Xiaoshan, who was secretly watching from behind the house, felt a shock. The killer's target was herself. Who was this person who hated her so much?

Although the killer's cold face had no response, Su Nan Tian was certain of his guess: "No, brother, say something!"

"? Crazy!"

The killer's mouth spat out two emotionless words. He had realized that as long as Su Nan Tian was present, it would be difficult to reach his target.

After thinking for a moment, the killer turned the fan's edge. The folding fan seemed to have been given life in his hand, moving unpredictably.

This weapon and fighting style looked flashy to laymen but weren't enough for Su Nan Tian, a veteran.

Seeing the killer temporarily giving up on Yue Xiaoshan and turning his attack toward himself, Su Nan Tian's mouth curved into a smile. As long as this guy didn't hurt Yue Xiaoshan, he could fully suppress him with his ability.

Although Su Nan Tian didn't know the killer's background, he could feel that besides this strange flexible body skill, a small fan was something he could barely handle. If he could perform at his usual level, the opponent wouldn't even have the ability to fight him.

Although this was said, the killer clearly wasn't a pushover. Several times he could use tricky angles to ambush Su Nan Tian.

This level of attack didn't harm Su Nan Tian much, but it was very annoying. The killer's skill with the iron fan exceeded his expectations.

"Damn, he's tough."

After testing a few rounds, Su Nan Tian barely dodged the opponent's fatal ambush and cursed.

He roared, suddenly unleashing his pressure, which directly pierced through the opponent's attack gap and aimed at the killer's heart.

The killer felt Su Nan Tian's sudden change in atmosphere. His lifeless eyes flickered with surprise, then he kicked Su Nan Tian's head.

Su Nan Tian knew the opponent's leg technique was strong. He sidestepped and grabbed the killer's leg to pull it back.

"You like kicking so much? I'll let you kick!"

Su Nan Tian cursed, his left arm exerting force and a sudden elbow strike aimed at the killer's knee. This was a refined attack technique that could instantly disable an enemy and temporarily render them unable to move.

Just as he was about to succeed, he suddenly felt his balance lost. Looking at the killer again, he found that the opponent had used his strength to hang onto his waist.

"Again this move!"

Su Nan Tian felt the opponent's legs, like a water snake, wrapped around his chest. The huge wrapping force made him feel suffocated.

Seizing this opportunity, the killer wrapped around him and quickly unfolded his fan. Two sharp blades glinted with cold light, directly piercing his forehead.

"Break it!"

At this critical moment, Su Nan Tian shouted with a red face and neck. One hand firmly grabbed the opponent's fan, keeping those two cold glints at his eyebrows. The other hand continuously gathered strength and then punched the opponent's chest.

The purpose of this flexible body skill was to soften muscles, bones, and soft tissue to gain more flexibility and agility. But it wasn't strong bodybuilding or high defense.

The killer was suddenly punched in the chest by Su Nan Tian, and his entire body felt black spots. A dizziness rushed to his brain. His body hanging on Su Nan Tian's waist was forcibly thrown away.

"Ha, don't you look at how many years I've been in this business. You're still trying to fight me?"

Su Nan Tian smiled, wiping his nose and playing with the fan he had just picked up. He mocked.

Seeing his weapon being messed around, for some reason, the killer's lifeless pupils suddenly flashed with endless killing intent.

"Who are you staring at? I took it!"

Su Nan Tian said, exaggeratingly opening and closing the iron fan. As he played around, he suddenly felt a chill down his spine. The killer's body, which had been swaying, shook.

Then the man lifted a pale face. His lips oozed blood. His gray pupils were filled with bloodlust.

"My god, he bit his tongue. It's not worth it, brother. It's just a broken fan."

Su Nan Tian saw the killer biting his tongue to relieve the pain in his chest and stay conscious. His evaluation of this killer immediately rose a level. With such a ruthless enemy, if he couldn't eliminate it, Yue Xiaoshan's safety would definitely not be guaranteed.

"Die!"

As Su Nan Tian was considering whether to eliminate the enemy, the killer on his knees moved. He let out a low growl and lunged at Su Nan Tian, intent on mutual destruction.

"Desperate last stand."

Seeing the killer's obvious flaws due to anger, Su Nan Tian smiled and was about to retaliate. Suddenly his pupils narrowed, realizing something was wrong. He instinctively used the fan to block the opponent's secretly extended hand.

Clink!

A light metal object collision sound echoed between them. Su Nan Tian sighed in relief, looking at the small dagger in the opponent's hand.

But the killer, failing to strike once, took advantage of Su Nan Tian's inattention and tried to reclaim the fan. This time, Su Nan Tian wouldn't let him have that chance. He punched his chest.

"Ugh!"

The killer spat out blood and was thrown back, falling heavily to the ground.

"Haha, you're tough. Come again."

Su Nan Tian smiled and disassembled the strange fan into individual bones, ending the killer's hope of reclaiming it.

At this moment, the situation was under control. Without any weapons that could threaten him, even if the killer was angry, he couldn't fight Su Nan Tian.

"Go away!"

Hearing Su Nan Tian mocking him, the killer's cold pupils flashed a chill. But he knew he had no ability to fight Su Nan Tian anymore. For the first time, he felt a desire to retreat.

"Want to leave?"

Because of the killer's exceptional assassination skills, Su Nan Tian wouldn't let him go this time. Previous events reminded him that kindness to enemies was cruelty to oneself. Enemies hiding in the shadows were the most dangerous.

Thinking of this, Su Nan Tian stepped on one foot and launched himself like a cannon at the killer's body.

Chapter 326: Unexpected Turn

Boom!

Their fists collided. The huge recoil force made the already lightly injured killer spit out more blood.

He held his dislocated arm and took a few steps back. A transparent small pill popped out from his black shirt's collar—probably something to save his life.

"Sorry, I'm actually a reasonable person. But I know that with your killers' determination to achieve their goals, if I let you leave safely today, you'll definitely come back again."

Su Nan Tian said this eloquent sentence, which made the killer feel nauseous. He also knew he might really die here.

For some reason, his pupils flashed with resentment. He hadn't done so many important things yet. How could he die here? But Su Nan Tian wouldn't give him a chance.

Puff!

With a kick, Su Nan Tian kicked the killer's neck in a stylish way, turning it into an unusual 90-degree angle. This level of injury was definitely fatal.

Then Su Nan Tian walked to Yue Xiaoshan and asked anxiously, "Xiaoshan, are you okay?"

"I'm fine."

Yue Xiaoshan's face was pale from fear. She shook her head repeatedly, "It was scary, but I'm glad you were here."

At this point, her phone rang. After answering it, she looked happy and pointed to a location. It seemed the people she had arranged were already in place.

"Miss!"

Not long after, a horn sounded from the front. Su Nan Tian looked up and saw that Yue's bodyguards had arrived quickly.

"Let's go. Get in the car first."

Yue Xiaoshan indicated Su Nan Tian to get into the car. As for the remaining traces at the scene, someone would handle it—no need for them to worry.

The car slowly moved forward. Yue Xiaoshan received another call. She listened while nodding, her face remained unchanged, but Su Nan Tian noticed that his eyebrows were tightly furrowed.

"The company had an incident."

After finishing the call, Yue Xiaoshan looked at Su Nan Tian, who was lost in thought, and said slowly.

"Huh?"

Su Nan Tian was confused about what she meant.

"Unknown why, a rumor spread that I had been assassinated. Then the company was attacked by unknown forces. Also, there's a traitor inside the group who knows all our financial movements and hits every target. Now the company is in chaos."

Yue Xiaoshan spoke a long sentence, her heart naturally tense. Xin Yue Group was her father's life's work. If it were destroyed by her, she would never forgive herself.

"Again such underhanded methods?"

Su Nan Tian also furrowed his brows deeply. All the events suddenly connected in his mind. He never expected that the hidden enemies of Yue's family could go this far.

"No, no, this isn't so simple."

Su Nan Tian suddenly thought of something. To steal the company's financial movements, it was impossible for outsiders to do.

"Perhaps your uncle also got involved?"

Su Nan Tian looked at Yue Xiaoshan's perfect profile and suddenly straightened his face. He remembered Yue Han's good friends.

Their eyes were on the group's power and knew everything about it. After elimination, the remaining people could only be Yue Xiaoshan's uncle, Yue Lin, and others. After all, they had always hated Yue Xiaoshan and coveted the group's shares.

After hearing Su Nan Tian's speculation, Yue Xiaoshan's face didn't show much surprise. She had known her uncle's treachery since childhood. Yue Han had also warned her to be careful of her uncle's attack, but she hadn't expected this day to come so quickly.

"What should we do now?"

Su Nan Tian didn't understand business matters, so he looked at Yue Xiaoshan with a questioning gaze.

"The most important thing now is to return to the company. Wu Han called and said that everyone in the company thought I was dead, with no morale left. They were at the mercy of those people."

Wu Han was also a veteran employee in the group, responsible for finance. He was one of Yue Xiaoshan's few close friends.

As for the rumor of her death, Yue Xiaoshan could only sigh helplessly. She had just been attacked, and then this rumor spread immediately. How much hatred did those enemies have for her to use such a trick? It was clear they were preparing to go all out.

"Okay, if you need anything later, just tell me. I'll do my best to help."

To Su Nan Tian, Yue Xiaoshan was not only the target of his mission since coming to Jiangcheng. Although they maintained a friendly and ambiguous relationship, Su Nan Tian could feel that she had feelings for him.

"Thank you."

For Su Nan Tian's chivalry, Yue Xiaoshan was touched but didn't take his words seriously. She truly didn't believe Su Nan Tian understood the war of commerce.

They quickly arrived at Xin Yue Building. The situation in Xin Yue Group was indeed as Wu Han said—whether it was the front desk or internal staff, they were all in chaos.

Some employees had already packed their things and prepared to flee.
