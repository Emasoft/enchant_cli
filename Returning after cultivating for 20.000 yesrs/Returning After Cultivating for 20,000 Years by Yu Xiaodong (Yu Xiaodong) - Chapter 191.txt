"Enhance your physical strength!" Su Nantian said indifferently, showing no interest whatsoever.

He reached into the chamber with a direct hand. Kuanglong was about to stop him, but it was already too late—he nearly fainted at that moment.

He knew the red light's power well. Anything that touched it turned to ash, and none could resist it. He had tested countless treasures, but none had ever touched the scroll inside.

He had assumed Su Nantian's hand would be instantly ruined, but to his surprise, the red light harmed it not at all.

Su Nantian effortlessly retrieved the ancient scroll and was puzzled—why couldn't this man achieve such an easy task?

Su Nantian cast a brief glance and immediately lost interest, handing the scroll to Kuanglong.

Kuanglong held the scroll as if it were a treasure, his eyes gleaming with joy. This was something he had dreamed of obtaining. Though this mysterious young man seemed to disregard it, it was his most cherished possession.

Though Su Nantian did not linger long, he immediately proceeded to the fourth level. The dim fourth level was filled with an eerie atmosphere. Su Nantian frowned as he surveyed the strange surroundings, while Ada tightly clutched his robe.

A black-armored warrior appeared in Su Nantian's view.

Su Nantian handed Ada to Kuanglong and immediately engaged the black-armored warrior in battle. The warrior, like many before him, met his fate—disintegrated and scattered across the ground.

"You two stay here," Su Nantian said calmly. "I sense a dangerous aura above; it might be troublesome. I'll clear the way first, then you can follow."

Su Nantian swiftly fought his way up to the ninth level.

Upon arriving at the ninth level, there were no guards—only a statue. When Kuanglong saw it, he gasped in astonishment: "Prophet's Statue."

"Drop your blood on it to see your future," Kuanglong said, his voice trembling with excitement. "But this only grants three chances."

Who wouldn't want to glimpse their future?

After scrutinizing it for a while, Su Nantian detected no danger. He stepped forward and dripped a single drop of blood onto the statue's hand.

A mist quickly formed before his eyes, revealing an indistinct layer. Su Nantian stared at the mist for a long time but could not decipher it. Soon, the mist vanished.

When Su Nantian regained his senses, Kuanglong eagerly asked, "Young master, what did you see?"

"Only a white mist—nothing else," Su Nantian said after careful consideration.

"That can't be right. Maybe it's broken," Kuanglong muttered, stepping forward to drip his blood onto the statue.

But before his blood touched the statue's palm, cracks began forming from the hand outward. The statue shattered into pieces.

Kuanglong stared in shock, realizing Su Nantian's prediction had apparently triggered a backlash. This deepened his curiosity about Su Nantian’s foresight, but if he had only seen mist, then perhaps it was just mist.

After the statue's destruction, she no longer harbored any expectations. The three of them quickly exited the ninth-level tower and returned to its first level.

Kuanglong led them to a teleportation array, setting the destination. Su Nantian and Ada vanished into the light.

When they reappeared, they were directly at Black Wind Cliff.

Su Nantian gazed into the distance; Black Wind Cliff was bustling with activity, as if hosting a celebration. Had Xiao Wang already been captured?

This made Su Nantian's heart tighten. He hadn't expected a hidden realm to delay the most critical matter, and he even felt regret—perhaps it was still not too late to arrive.

Su Nantian immediately led Ada into a swift sprint toward Black Wind Cliff. Though it seemed near, it took him an hour to reach the mountain's base.

Seeing the black plaque, his anger flared. He smashed it into dust. As the powder fell to the ground, thunder rumbled in the sky.

Su Nantian rushed toward the summit and entered a secluded spot, whispering something into Ada's ear. Ada nodded repeatedly.

They hurried toward Black Wind Cliff’s meeting hall, and Su Nantian knocked out a subordinate. He molded his face to resemble the man's and changed into his clothes, blending seamlessly into the crowd. He followed Ada into the hall.

At that moment, Xiao Wang stood alone on the stage. A mysterious cloaked figure sat upon a black throne, surrounded by eerie black mist.

Chapter 954: The Path to Enlightenment

When Su Nantian saw the mysterious shadow, his mind felt struck by lightning. Countless memories surged into his consciousness but failed to coalesce, as if this person's amnesia was deeply tied to it.

Gradually, his head felt increasingly swollen, as if about to explode.

The mysterious figure stared intently at the black mist swirling around Xiao Wang, which grew increasingly violent. The dark-cloaked figure's aura became more erratic.

Suddenly, it let out a terrifying scream. Black mist burst from its mouth and rushed out of the hall.

Bloodlight appeared on the ground, quickly forming a magical array.

Su Nantian felt the glowing blood beneath him and endured his throbbing head as he rushed toward Xiao Wang. But as soon as he took flight, the mysterious figure sensed him.

The cloaked man waved a hand, sending black mist to envelop Su Nantian. No matter how he struggled, he could not break free from the strange black mass. It completely restrained his power, as if wrapped in a soft cotton ball—no matter how hard he tried, it felt like striking empty space.

The cloaked man then cradled Xiao Wang in his arms. He cut open Xiao Wang's wrist with a hand, and blood trickled down the pale skin, seeping into the array below. With the addition of blood, the array rapidly rotated. The ground seemed glued to Xiao Wang's feet; his legs could not leave it. Blood trickled up through his soles into the array, and everyone let out painful screams.

But the cloaked man seemed deaf to it, even letting out an eerie laugh.

"Your blood will not flow in vain; it will forever exist in this world. When I dye the entire world black, that shall be your rebirth and eternal day. Ha ha!" The cloaked man let out an excited roar.

His entire body transformed into a swirling black mist, tightly wrapping around Xiao Wang.

Su Nantian's eyes narrowed at the sight. He sensed Xiao Wang’s life energy rapidly fading, with countless black mists flowing into his body.

Did he not realize it? He was trying to take over Xiao Wang's body!

Such a cruel array—was this the purpose of waiting for this moment?

It was too brutal. Su Nantian roared with anger but felt powerless. Memories flooded his mind.

He searched through the memories, trying to find a way out. He endured the pain and finally discovered the secret technique: "Lightning Summoning Art."

Su Nantian chanted a spell, and dark clouds gathered overhead. A lightning bolt the width of a water bucket struck the mountain's peak, penetrating through layers of earth to strike Su Nantian directly.

The black mist around him instantly exploded, freeing his body. His entire form shimmered with lightning, as if ready to burst apart. Even his eyes glowed with electric energy.

With a wave of his hand, a massive lightning hand formed instantly and lunged toward Xiao Wang. The lightning seemed to naturally repel the black mist.

As the lightning eroded Xiao Wang's body, the black mists spilled out. But Su Nantian clearly saw Xiao Wang was in immense pain, the lightning's stimulation extremely harsh.

In the end, Su Nantian could not bear it. The lightning vanished.

Xiao Wang's face gradually revealed a second, sinister and terrifying face, as if mocking him.

"Come on, kill me and Xiao Wang together; then you can avenge them, your family and friends," the strange voice cried from Xiao Wang.

Su Nantian roared upward, and countless lightning bolts rained down upon the array. The entire array shuddered.

The strange face let out a thunderous roar and transformed into black mist, diving into the array. The dark array quickly resumed its rotation.

Su Nantian furrowed his brow; this array gave him a terrible premonition. If it completed, it might bring about the world's destruction. He felt a terrifying power hidden beneath the array.

Su Nantian waved his hand, forming a lightning fist and repeatedly bombarding the array. Though it wavered, it did not collapse.

Su Nantian's body radiated lightning and plunged into the array. Though lacking external conditions, it was better than letting the array continue its operation.

Moreover, he clearly felt Xiao Wang's energy weakening. If he did not stop it, Xiao Wang would be assimilated.

This outcome was unacceptable to him.

As soon as he entered the array, Su Nantian felt evil forces surrounding him. He released lightning outward to protect himself.

He continuously destroyed the array's various points.

"Hahahaha, it's useless—everything you do is futile," the mysterious cloaked figure's terrifying voice echoed within the array.

Hmph!

Su Nantian snorted and accelerated his movements. Suddenly, he turned and punched a dark spot. A black mist clung to the wall.

"You're not bad, I didn't expect it. Have you remembered who I am?" the mysterious voice echoed again.

"Whoever you are, today you must die," Su Nantian said coldly.

After this long struggle, he clearly felt his lightning power was running low. He needed to find the array's core quickly.

Suddenly, a vision flashed in Su Nantian’s mind—this must be the array's core.

He didn't know where this vision came from, perhaps from the previous prophecy.

He quickly searched through the array and soon found the core's location.

With punch after punch, he struck the core. When it cracked, the mysterious figure roared again: "You're looking for death, aren't you?" Its voice was filled with anger.

Suddenly, countless black blades appeared behind Su Nantian.

Plop plop plop!

Countless blades pierced his body, but Su Nantian's actions did not stop. He continued to punch the array relentlessly.

Finally, when Su Nantian delivered his last punch, the array exploded in a thunderous crash.

The cloaked figure let out an earth-shaking roar. Black mist scattered in all directions.

The black mist blades that had formed on Su Nantian's body gradually disappeared, but the countless holes remained.

The clouds in the sky dispersed along with the black mist. The black energy weakened, and so did Su Nantian.

Ada ran from a distant hillside, collapsing to his side with a loud cry of "Master."

"Take care of Xiao Wang," Su Nantian said his last words before falling into a deep sleep.

Su Nantian watched his soul leave his body. He might have died.

He felt at ease seeing Ada, having taken this disciple on his deathbed. He was reliable.

All of Su Nantian's family in this world had passed away, and he had no more attachments.

Gradually, he came to terms with it. After all, death is inevitable for humans.

Suddenly, eight chains appeared on his soul. He clearly felt something in the sky was calling him.

When Su Nantian's soul reached the dome, another chain descended. When nine chains wrapped around his body, he felt a new power—different from any before.

He had the feeling that with one thought, he could control life and death.

Suddenly, a sentence appeared in his mind: "Nine Lives of Reincarnation, Finally the Great Dao."

The memories of nine lives flooded his mind—countless regrets. Though he had tried to save them each time, there were always lingering regrets.

The chains on his body were nine reincarnation chains, signifying he had died nine times and achieved the Great Dao.

But at this moment, his heart felt empty. Though he had finally attained his lifelong goal, he was alone.

Though friends could be revived with a single thought, they would never be the same again.

Su Nantian accepted it. Gradually, his soul became transparent as the nine great dao chains merged into one.
