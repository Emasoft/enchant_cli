The moment he changed his technique was unassuming, but the spectators outside were already murmuring in confusion.

Within the campus, there wasn't just a Taekwondo club; there was also a Wushu (martial arts) club. However, due to Long Hu Yan's overwhelming strength, the Wushu club had long been overshadowed by the Taekwondo group.

No one expected that in this match, Long Hu Yan would first employ Taekwondo but fail to win, then reveal the posture of ancient Chinese martial arts—this was truly unexpected!

Even some students from the Wushu club sitting in the corners clapped excitedly. Though they still couldn't defeat Long Hu Yan, at least it proved that Chinese martial arts remained profound and extensive!

Yet, the posture Long Hu Yan adopted was merely a facade in the eyes of ordinary people.

In Su Nantian's view, however, this moment presented an entirely different scene.

A pale yellow tiger composed of spiritual energy rose from his body, its majestic head roaring toward the sky with a thunderous roar. Spiritual energy formed tiger claws on his hands, flickering like burning flames.

"Ah?"

Su Nantian narrowed his eyes, scrutinizing Long Hu Yan's transformation. What was this technique? He had never encountered it before.

Although Su Nantian had spent 20,000 years in the cultivation world and although the cultivation civilization of that realm far surpassed Earth's, this didn't mean all Earth's traditions could be paralleled in the cultivation world.

For instance, the technique Long Hu Yan was using now—Su Nantian had never seen it before.

Not to mention its combat power, but just by the sheer spectacle of it, it was truly impressive! If he hadn't been careful not to reveal his power to these ordinary people, the visual effects would have rivaled an American blockbuster.

After setting up his stance, seeing Su Nantian remained unresponsive, Long Hu Yan no longer hesitated. He leaped into the air like a tiger crossing a ravine, his twin claws rushing straight for Su Nantian's face.

"Cheh! I thought you had some talent, but in the end, it's still just this!"

Seeing the resplendent tiger, Su Nantian had expected some new trickery. Instead, it was still close-range combat—disappointing.

He extended his hands to intercept the charging tiger claws, and with a flick of his wrist, he flung Long Hu Yan away again.

But what he hadn't anticipated happened at that moment! Although Su Nantian had thrown Long Hu Yan away, the resplendent tiger made of spiritual energy didn't leave with him. Instead, it remained in place, its palm-sized tiger claws striking Su Nantian's face directly!

"Damn, this has some power!"

That claw wasn't light at all—only Su Nantian's thick skin allowed him to endure it. A single strike left blood streaks on his lips.

He accidentally hit his cheek against a tooth...

"Spit!"

He spat out the blood, and Su Nantian's eyes grew intense. It had been a long time since he'd fought so satisfyingly. This Long Hu Yan truly brought him some excitement.

Although there were still countless ordinary people watching the battle, it wasn't appropriate to use unconventional weapons like flying swords.

But hand-to-hand combat—this was the romance of men!

Seeing himself outwitted, Su Nantian had only managed to break his cheek—barely a wound. Long Hu Yan's face turned dark.

He hadn't expected that someone of his age and peer group could be so strong!

For years, he had considered himself exceptionally gifted, beyond the reach of ordinary people.

Yet today, he'd finally tasted what failure felt like.

Turning around, he looked at Zhang Xiaoya beneath the stage. This cute woman was still gazing at Su Nantian with infatuation, making Long Hu Yan feel an inexplicable urge to laugh. At this moment, he even questioned whether this girl was suitable for him.

But seemingly sensing his gaze, Zhang Xiaoya withdrew her eyes from Su Nantian and looked at Long Hu Yan.

"Go for it!"

A simple gesture, three words of support—this had filled Long Hu Yan with energy. Ah, it was so like love.

Love: No problem, whatever it is, it's all like my dad!

Although Su Nantian didn't know what had happened, he was happy to see Long Hu Yan's fighting spirit return. He took a step forward, spiritual energy gathering on his body. Though he didn't have Long Hu Yan's technique to form a tiger.

Chapter 258: Should I Propose?!
Though it was slightly more complex than凝聚剑气 (condensing sword energy), it was only a slight expenditure of mental effort. For Su Nantian, there was no difficulty at all.

Of course, this sword energy was invisible to ordinary people. In the midst of everyone's attention, two people secretly tested their cultivation techniques—this was quite exciting.

In a corner unnoticed by anyone, Zhu Jie and Li Zhan stood watching this battle.

Originally, they had come here just to observe Su Nantian. Unexpectedly, they had gained an unexpected discovery!

Long Hu Yan's existence was unknown to the National Security Bureau's 6th Division. For years, he had believed himself unique, so he had remained low-key, using Taekwondo as a cover. He hadn't drawn attention.

If it weren't for today's encounter with Su Nantian, a peer of his kind, Long Hu Yan might never have revealed his cultivation abilities.

"Unexpectedly, this small Fengcheng city has so many hidden talents. One after another—where did these guys come from? It's really adding to our workload!"

You stood by watching the battle, muttering involuntarily. Su Nantian's strength was beyond his comprehension, but he guessed it must be extremely strong.

This Long Hu Yan had a sharp technique and formidable strength, his spiritual energy tiger even making Li Zhan think he could fight him!

To be honest, this evaluation wasn't low. It wasn't that Li Zhan thought himself strong; it was simply because this little guy had only reached the sixth level of cultivation, while Li Zhan himself was at the seventh.

In other words, in Li Zhan's eyes, Long Hu Yan's strength was capable of defeating higher-level opponents.

Compared to Li Zhan's focus on Long Hu Yan, Zhu Jie's main attention was fixed on Su Nantian.

To him, compared to Long Hu Yan, Su Nantian was far too mysterious—so mysterious that he couldn't find any trace of his past.

Or rather, the traces of Su Nantian's past were so ordinary that they made it impossible to believe they were real.

It was as if these records were only what he allowed you to see, while the rest remained hidden from view forever.

If Su Nantian knew what they were thinking, he might have laughed so hard he choked. People's nature is a recording machine; more bluntly, people's nature is imagination.

They were just overthinking. Before Su Nantian returned from the cultivation world, he had been a complete fool. Everything you found out before was true!

Sometimes, the more real something is, the less people believe it.

At this moment, the battle on the platform had reached its peak. Su Nantian held a spiritual energy sword, clashing with Long Hu Yan's tiger—appearing evenly matched.

But the truth was clear to Long Hu Yan. The opponent hadn't used his true strength, merely playing along with him.

With his current power, he couldn't force the opponent to use all his strength.

The battle was fierce and spectacular, making all the ordinary spectators excited.

But Long Hu Yan knew he couldn't last long. From the very beginning, his defeat had been inevitable. The only thing he couldn't let go of was Zhang Xiaoya.

He had planned to confess his love after winning this match. The 99 roses in the back were already arranged into a bouquet, waiting for the moment to be delivered.

So he had absolute confidence. This match, he couldn't lose!

Unfortunately, things never relied on personal will. Even if he was unwilling and felt he couldn't lose, in the end, it was still an inevitable defeat.

The tiger roared toward the sky with its final roar. He knew he was about to face defeat, like an old man in his twilight years.

But the tiger's might still remained. With Long Hu Yan's last strength, it rushed toward Su Nantian!

Su Nantian looked at him with respect. Though this guy's strength wasn't great, his combat awareness was quite good—definitely a fighter who fought until the end.

"Since it's come to this, let me show you my true strength!"

As Su Nantian softly recited, a faint blade of light hovered beside him—Fuyun Sword!

Fortunately, he had felt like refining Fuyun Sword the night before. With the added illusion array, ordinary people couldn't detect Fuyun Sword's presence.

"What... this is a flying sword?"

Seeing the small blade hovering before Su Nantian, Long Hu Yan's eyes widened in disbelief! He had never imagined that he would see a flying sword again. His inheritance hadn't mentioned that the art of flying swords had been lost centuries ago.

Not only was Long Hu Yan shocked, but Zhu Jie and Li Zhan hiding in the corner were also stunned. Their eyes widened like oxen's, their mouths gaping open and unable to close.

"Zhu Jie... am I seeing things?"

"No, I saw it too."

"Did you see what? A flying sword?"

...

Zhang Xiaoya stood behind the platform, her gaze had been on Long Hu Yan all along. Her eyes sparkled with admiration, as if she could see the real battle.

When Fuyun Sword appeared beside Su Nantian, she too widened her eyes in disbelief, unable to believe it.

No one paid attention to the shock of the onlookers. Fuyun Sword, before Su Nantian's eyes, expanded rapidly and in an instant had become a twelve-foot-long giant sword!

This massive sword was black at its base, with dark golden patterns barely visible. It hovered in midair, exuding a powerful aura.

"Cut!"

With Su Nantian's soft command, the twelve-foot-long sword descended!

It struck directly at the tiger's forehead.

There was no terrifying sound of collision, no dazzling light. The tiger made of spiritual energy was directly split in two by the flying sword. It flickered twice, like a broken light bulb, and instantly vanished.

Long Hu Yan was dejected, staring at the scene in disbelief. He couldn't believe it.

Only when that twelve-foot-long sword quickly shrank and became a blade mark, disappearing into Su Nantian's forehead did he realize that this wasn't an illusion—it was real.

"Ah!"

He exhaled deeply, and Long Hu Yan calmly said to Su Nantian: "I lost."

"Hey," Su Nantian didn't say much, but he pointed behind Long Hu Yan.

Long Hu Yan turned around and saw Zhang Xiaoya behind him, her eyes full of concern.

Moreover, in the distance at a corner, his several subordinates were holding the 99 roses, unsure whether to approach.

He smiled, though this smile had a bitter touch.

Chapter 259: I Love You Because You're Ugly!

After thinking for a while, he still waved to his subordinates and took the 99 roses.

The scene was chaotic. Countless spectators murmured in confusion. They didn't know what had happened, why the fight suddenly ended with a loss? And why after losing he brought out a bouquet of roses?

Could it be...

This bouquet was for a confession. Long Hu Yan's loss was actually to...

At this moment, how many girls' eyes sparkled with stars. Although it felt like a waste of resources to have two high-quality boys together.

But what did that matter? Even if they didn't end up together, it wasn't my business. Let them be together so that others don't get the chance!

Watching Long Hu Yan accept the roses with love, staring at Su Nantian, how many girls started cheering and said yes to him...

Long Hu Yan's mighty physique paired with Su Nantian's delicate appearance was truly like love!

As the saying goes, female fans see men as lovers. Without warning, the atmosphere that had been tense suddenly became oddly romantic.

"Zhu Jie, Zhu Jie, you're usually smart. Can you tell me what's going on here?"

Zhu Jie, pulled by Li Zhan, collected himself and glared at him unkindly. "Hmph, I don't know!"

Ugh, why did Long Hu Yan have to make it so romantic? It made people feel...

Looking back at Li Zhan beside him, people compare themselves to death; goods compare themselves to being discarded!

For some reason, Li Zhan felt Zhu Jie's gaze toward him was strange, making his back feel cold.

Fortunately, the scene didn't go in that weird direction. Taking the roses from his subordinates, Long Hu Yan looked at Su Nantian and then took the bouquet to Zhang Xiaoya.

"Xiaoya, from the moment I saw you, I knew I liked you. Originally, I was going to confess after winning today... but...

But, the flowers are already bought. As a man, I can't back down now.

I..."

The scene once again became火爆, but this time it was mostly the boys who were excited. The girls who had previously sparkled in their eyes now felt jealous.

What's so good about this Xiaoya? She might not be as pretty as me, maybe even less...

Ugh, why am I feeling so nervous?

Never mind. Since Long Hu Yan's target wasn't Su Nantian, it should be me, right? Why would she end up with him?

Zhang Xiaoya slightly opened her mouth, smiling happily on her face as she said something quietly.

Unfortunately, Long Hu Yan's mind was full of confusion and he hadn't thought much. He handed over the roses and turned to leave, thinking that since he had lost the match, his confession would naturally fail.

Moreover, before entering the match, he had seen Zhang Xiaoya gazing at Su Nantian with infatuation. That "so handsome" had been like a thorn in his heart.

But as Long Hu Yan was about to leave, Zhang Xiaoya grabbed him.

This girl wasn't the least bit delicate but had a strong presence.

"Did I just propose to my mom? What are you going to do now?"

Seeing this bright girl smiling and calling herself "mom," Long Hu Yan felt like God was playing a joke on him. Something didn't feel right—was this still the original Zhang Xiaoya?

"Uh... what did you say?"

Uncertain, Long Hu Yan asked again.

"I said I accepted your proposal!" Zhang Xiaoya didn't feel the least bit shy, her eyes directly meeting Long Hu Yan's. She said this seriously.

This serious answer made Long Hu Yan unsure.

"Why... why? You didn't say Su Nantian was handsome and defeated me..."

Stuttering, Long Hu Yan wanted to find an answer.

"Are you stupid? Just because I said he was handsome does that mean I have to like him? Although you're not as good-looking, your skills aren't as high, and your strength isn't as strong. You also don't study well.

But at least, the flaws in you make me feel more real. I know what longing is and what reality is.

Although Su Nantian is handsome, he's not for me. Around him are already a bunch of little flirtatious girls. How could I have any chance?

So, reality still prefers you more. After all, you're ugly, so there aren't many people chasing after you!"

"..."

Zhang Xiaoya spoke clearly and directly. She was willing to accept Long Hu Yan's proposal. But for some reason, Long Hu Yan didn't feel happy at all.

I love you because you're ugly...

That's really a despairing reason!

It's easy to understand. Zhang Xiaoya was pretty, but she was tall and had a bold personality.

So many boys were afraid of her. Even those who wanted to approach her didn't find her appealing. Who wouldn't want a delicate girl? For most of his life, no one had caught her eye.

Now that she found a suitable match, she naturally wouldn't give it up.

"So you two are together now?"

Su Nantian looked at the two holding hands, unsure of what he felt.

After finishing lunch on the platform, the three had made a private agreement to have dinner. Now they were sitting in a restaurant's private room near the school.

Zhang Xiaoya openly admitted it, while Long Hu Yan felt a bit embarrassed.

Su Nantian hadn't noticed before, but now he carefully sensed that Zhang Xiaoya was also a cultivator. Her cultivation level of three stages wasn't high, but she had already entered the path.

It made him feel a bit nostalgic. Recently, so many cultivators kept popping up. Was it really like in novels—spirit energy revival and gods returning?

He snorted, looking down on the so-called god path.

In 20,000 years in the cultivation world, he hadn't met many people who cultivated gods. Their god path wasn't as powerful, and in Su Nantian's view, it was somewhat absurd.

The god path of the cultivation world first required ruling a country to collect offerings, then using these offerings to enfeoff gods—subordinates.

Establishing an imperial court, gradually developing and managing the four directions. Finally, it might truly achieve the mythological凌霄天庭 (Lingxiao Heaven Court), but he had never seen it.

Recalling his thoughts, Su Nantian waved to set up a simple sound barrier in the room before speaking:

"You and I are not ordinary people. Walking on the path of cultivation means we'll get stronger and stronger. But now, there are fewer and fewer cultivators, making it difficult to communicate."

Chapter 260: Qingyang's Movement

"I cultivate the sword immortal path. I don't know about the two of you..."

Long Hu Yan and Zhang Xiaoya exchanged glances, both showing surprise. They hadn't expected Su Nantian to ask so directly.

Even Long Hu Yan didn't know Zhang Xiaoya was a cultivator.

But since he had asked, there was no need to hide it.

Long Hu Yan replied directly: "My path is called Xianwu. It's said to be the lineage of Wude Star Lord, but I don't know if it's true.

It has existed for over 800 years, but now only I remain as a disciple."

"I'm from Longhu Mountain... I cultivate the art of formations, inherited from..."

While Su Nantian and the two were having dinner in the restaurant, Zhu Jie and Li Zhan had already left the campus.

"Unexpectedly, this small Fengcheng city has so many hidden talents! Even that Long Hu Yan guy actually had some ability, managing to win over Old Zhang's girl.

I wonder how Old Zhang would react when he heard this news. Hehe, I can't help but call him to tell him!"

Seeing Li Zhan's face showing a sly smile, he called Old Zhang. Zhu Jie didn't stop him.

The waters in Fengcheng were getting more and more murky. Zhu Jie wasn't against stirring up the water even more.

His mission from above was to investigate the massive spiritual energy fluctuation in the western suburbs of Fengcheng. Unexpectedly, it had led to so many people.

Su Nantian, the lineage of sword immortals; Long Hu Yan, the Xianwu path. Even Old Zhang's girl was here—this was complex and surprising.

Moreover, there were also the Hezhou Wu family involved. And at the scene, Zhu Jie had sensed another powerful presence.

A mysterious stranger who fought alongside Su Nantian to eliminate all the other cultivators. Now this mysterious power hadn't appeared yet, making Zhu Jie feel things were getting out of control.

Old Zhang was also a member of the National Security Bureau's 6th Division, and he was a top-tier talent. His strength was very strong, said to be just one step away from the legendary innate stage.

Zhu Jie needed a reason to call him over, so he could be of help at the crucial moment.

And now, your cabbage was eaten by a pig outside—seemed like a good excuse.

At this moment in the restaurant, the three's conversation continued.

"My path is based on spiritual energy, with power as its mainstay. It constructs divine beasts and stores martial gods; although it's a spell, it can be used in close combat."

Su Nantian was very interested in Long Hu Yan's Xianwu path. Using spiritual energy to form beasts, and even evolving them—this was truly ingenious.

Perhaps the power wasn't surprising to Su Nantian, but some of its ideas could provide him with inspiration.

The two kept exchanging information. Su Nantian used his 20,000 years of experience to analyze the Xianwu path's techniques and tried to strengthen them.

This greatly benefited Long Hu Yan, solving many problems he had encountered in his cultivation. And Su Nantian also gained much.

After all, it was a technique created by an ancient sage, with undeniable advantages.

Li Zhan and Zhu Jie hadn't had a good time these days. Their mission from above seemed impossible to complete. The western suburbs battle, one side was clearly Su Nantian, and the other was Hezhou Wu family.

But Zhu Jie was worried about who the mysterious presence's owner was and what stance they were taking.

Su Nantian's strength wasn't any worse than theirs, and he had a flying sword. Even if they combined their efforts, they weren't sure they could take him down.

Plus there was a mysterious power lurking in the shadows, making it hard to act recklessly.

But Lu Jiajun had been asking him constantly when he could avenge Su Nantian. For this Lu family's son, who had once been a prestigious family, Zhu Jie was really at a loss.

His father's debt to the Lu family had three conditions. If used properly, it could even revive the Lu family.

But both generations had wasted it.

Yet at this awkward moment, a message suddenly came through. Their mission was canceled, and they had to immediately head to Qingyang Mountain.

Why had the reclusive Qingyang Sect been active? The National Security Bureau's 6th Division members weren't many. The closest ones were them, so they were naturally assigned to Qingyang Mountain to check what had happened.

Su Nantian was also familiar with Qingyang Mountain. When he was in the Hezhou Wu family, he had met a disciple of the Qingyang Sect named Sun Peng. He still remembered that Sun Peng had a sword with great spirit.

In fact, Qingyang Mountain's movement was due to Sun Peng. After Su Nantian discovered Sun Peng's sword, he realized the spirit of the sword was bonded with Sun Peng. So Su Nantian didn't take it but left a simple sword technique for him.

Although this sword technique was crude compared to his own, it was enough for Sun Peng to refine a flying sword.

In fact, Sun Peng proved himself a top-tier genius. He was devoted and loyal to his sword.

The sword technique Su Nantian gave him, after he returned and secluded himself for some time, had already understood its principles. Now he could control his sword.

This was his opportunity and also his disaster!

Qingyang Mountain, the back of Qingyang Sect's mountain, in a dilapidated cave. Sun Peng sat cross-legged with his sword lying across his knees.

On the blade was a streak of blood, gradually being absorbed into it. This was a technique for refining swords by using one's own blood to cultivate, making the sword more attuned to one's will.

Sun Peng had never used this method before. Although it made the sword more attuned to one's will, it was too aggressive. But now he had no choice.

Three days ago, he finally mastered controlling his sword and excitedly told the sect elders. Instead, he was locked up in the back mountain.

The entire Qingyang Sect claimed to be sword cultivators, but in reality, most were just common sword techniques. The true art of sword immortals had no inheritance.

Sun Peng suddenly mastering controlling his sword was a big event for the Qingyang Sect. If handled well, it wasn't impossible to return the sect to its former glory.

Unfortunately, some people were short-sighted. After the Qingyang Sect revealed all their information, the first command from the sect was to have Sun Peng hand over his sword manual.

Although Sun Peng felt something was wrong, since this technique had been given to him by Su Nantian and he hadn't agreed to share it, he didn't agree.

But Sun Peng had grown up in the sect. He had lived there for over twenty years, and this place was his home.

The elders ordered him to hand over the sword manual. It was hard to refuse, so he had no choice but to reluctantly submit.

But the matter didn't end there.

Chapter 261: Cutting a Path Through Blood

After submitting the manual, the sect elders followed the manual's instructions to cultivate sword techniques. None of them could succeed.

Because mastering this technique required a spiritual sword attuned to one's will. Ordinary weapons couldn't do it.

The Qingyang Sect claimed to be a sword sect, but they had no knowledge of refining flying swords!

The sect might have some inherited magical items, but none were spiritual swords.

Then the sect's master set his sights on Sun Peng's spiritual sword. Although Sun Peng had repeatedly explained that his spiritual sword was bonded with him and couldn't be given to others, the elders blinded by greed didn't believe him.

Even his own master had been urging him to hand over his sword.

For this, Sun Peng wasn't entirely against it. If handing over the sword truly helped the sect, he was willing to do so, after all, he had grown up there.

But he knew the sword could only be used by himself. No one believed him.

The sect master gave Sun Peng three days to think, locking him in the back mountain cave. Today was the third day.

"Senior Brother Sun, how are you thinking? The master sent me to take you to the Sword Pavilion. It's time to reveal Qingying Sword."

A voice of smugness echoed from outside—Zhang Kun, his junior brother. He had followed him since childhood, taking advantage of him many times.

But after growing up, his cultivation wasn't as good as Sun Peng's. His progress slowed down, so he became increasingly jealous and their relationship grew distant.

Now, the situation had reversed. Sun Peng was a prisoner in this cave while Zhang Kun was the guard.

Zhang Kun had long envied Qingying Sword. His master had given Sun Peng the rare iron to refine his sword, which was a waste.

In Zhang Kun's view, without this iron, Sun Peng might not have been better than him.

"Let's go,"

Hearing Zhang Kun's words, Sun Peng calmly got up and sheathed his sword. He walked out of the cave without even looking at him, heading straight for the Sword Pavilion.

Behind Sun Peng, Zhang Kun sneered. Let you be smug for a few more minutes. When the master asks you to hand over Qingying Sword, what will you do then?

Sun Peng arrived at the entrance of the Sword Pavilion and heard elders discussing inside.

"Everyone, Qingying Sword's power is well known. It's a shame to have it in Sun Peng's hands. Do you know how to get it?"

"Directly ask him to hand it over. He wouldn't dare refuse!"

"No! Sun Peng's words were true. Qingying Sword's spirit was born from him. Others can't control it. If he hands it over directly, it would just be a common weapon."

"What then?"

"I have an idea. I don't know if it's appropriate to say..."

Sun Peng could tell the one speaking was none other than his master.

"Junior Brother, what's your idea? Speak quickly!"

Hearing his master had an idea, the elders all anxiously asked him. Even Sun Peng outside the pavilion was curious to hear his master's plan.

After all, he had been nurtured by the sect. If he could hand over Qingying Sword to the sect properly, it would be a good thing.

Sun Peng's master, Guan Yang Daoist, didn't rush. He smiled and combed his long beard.

"Have you all heard of the story of Ganjiang and Moxie?"

"What's the meaning behind your mention of this story, Senior Brother?"

"This year there was a swordsmith named Ganjiang. He forged two famous swords for the king, but because of insufficient spirit, he sacrificed his wife in a furnace. However, after forging them, the swords still lacked spirit. So Ganjiang sacrificed himself in the furnace to forge two perfect divine weapons—Ganjiang and Moxie!

Now, we could imitate Ganjiang with Qingying Sword!"

Hearing this, everyone understood. If they remelted Qingying Sword and sacrificed Sun Peng in the furnace, it could significantly enhance Qingying Sword's spirit, making it a divine weapon.

And Sun Peng would be dead, no longer having the restriction that only he could use it.

"Excellent!"

Hearing Guan Yang Daoist's words, the others all smiled and nodded. It was truly a good plan.

The only one who couldn't smile was Sun Peng standing outside. The weather today was nice, warm sunlight on his back, but he felt no warmth at all—only a chill down his spine!

"Are you willing?" Qingying Sword asked softly in his hand.

The sword trembled slightly, emitting a clear sound of its blade!

Discontent. He was discontent. It was also discontent.

"Senior Brother Sun, what are you standing here for? Hurry in!"

Zhang Kun, who had been left behind, came over and patted Sun Peng's shoulder.

Smiling with a grin on his face, he could already imagine how painful it would be for Sun Peng without Qingying Sword.

Even a petty person's mindset couldn't imagine how heartless the sect elders inside the pavilion were.

Sun Peng smiled on his face, nodded to Zhang Kun and walked into the hall with a smile.

Seeing Sun Peng's smile, Zhang Kun felt it was strangely glaring.

"Hmph! Wait and see. Without Qingying Sword, you're nothing!"

Sun Peng stepped into the Sword Pavilion and closed the door behind him.

The head of the Sword Pavilion looked at Sun Peng, smiling and asked: "Sun Peng, are you willing to hand over Qingying Sword to the sect?

If you are, the sect won't disappoint you!"

Yes, it wouldn't disappoint. It would be sacrificed, right?

Sun Peng lowered his head, smiling humbly and took two steps forward. He said to the master: "Disciple Sun Peng was raised by the sect since childhood. The sect nurtured me.

As long as it's natural, I can hand it over to the sect."

Hearing this, the master nodded happily. He was clearly satisfied.

"Report to the master's address: Not only is he willing to hand over his experience to the sect, but he also thought of a way for others to control Qingying Sword in these days!"

"What? What's the method?"

Hearing Sun Peng's words, although he wasn't very interested, the master still continued. After all, one was to control Qingying Sword, and the other would significantly enhance its spirit. Which was more important was obvious.

"Let me explain in detail!"

Sun Peng took off his sword and held it high, approaching the master.

The head of the Sword Pavilion seemed interested in Sun Peng's method and leaned forward slightly to look at him.

Chapter 262: Sun Peng Comes to Join

But just as they were less than a step apart, the sword in Sun Peng's hand suddenly unsheathed itself and shot toward the master like a streak of light!

"You!"

This sudden change caught everyone by surprise! Qingyang Sect's master, Qingyang Daoist, wanted to dodge but had no time.

Flying sword—fast as lightning. In an instant, it sliced through the master's neck, and a large head flew into the air!

Blood gushed out like a fountain from the neckless cavity, filling the entire Sword Pavilion with the smell of blood.

"You!"

The other elders were all shocked and panicked. Holding their swords, they didn't know what to do for a moment.

But Sun Peng didn't hesitate. His Qingying Sword was truly named as such, becoming a silent shadow that moved between the people and took lives!

"Sun Peng, I am your master!"

"Haha... Master! What a good master. How? Do you want me to put you in the furnace to refine your sword?"
