Thus, Su Nantian remained composed, continuing to sit in his seat, awaiting the two men's approach. He observed the unfolding situation carefully, determining what strategy he would employ to infiltrate the Nan Gong family's ranks that day.

The two men from the Nan Gong clan arrived, escorted by a group of subordinates. Immediately afterward, another group emerged from elsewhere. Upon seeing this, Su Nantian quickly deduced that these individuals were those seeking to join the Nan Gong family.

The Nan Gong clan's daughter and son arrived, moving with familiarity to their designated seats. They nodded toward those around them, prompting the group to commence the selection process.

Chapter 448: Disrupting the Rhythm

The assistant standing by the Nan Gong clan's side immediately addressed the group before him, declaring, "Today is the time for the Nan Gong clan's master and mistress to select individuals they deem worthy. If you possess any talent, display it freely. Naturally, if you believe your intellect is exceptional, proceed to the adjacent room where we have personnel ready to assess you."

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian suddenly understood. This stage was specifically designed for those with martial prowess. Thus, the individuals present were all competitors.

Yet, several among them immediately struck Su Nantian as hopeless—none could match the Nan Gong clan's bodyguards, making it impossible for them to gain attention.

Therefore, Su Nantian chose to remain inactive, seated at his place. He enjoyed the meals before him while observing the stage's dynamics.

"Who will go first?" the Nan Gong clan's assistant asked again.

"I'll go first!" a burly man raised his hand and immediately stepped onto the stage. A row of weapon racks stood on the platform, suggesting these were prearranged props by the Nan Gong clan.

The man selected a long sword and performed an impressive display, his movements flowing like water. The blade's motion produced a distinct wind sound.

However, Su Nantian already knew this man was unworthy before the results were announced. His skill was insufficient to catch the Nan Gong clan's attention.

Though his swordplay was commendable, demonstrating strength and vigor, he paled in comparison to the Nan Gong clan's bodyguards. To them, he was merely a street performer.

Indeed, when the man had barely finished his performance, the Nan Gong clan's master waved a hand at his assistant, displaying impatience.

The assistant immediately understood and addressed the man on stage: "You have performed sufficiently. You may descend now."

Everyone present at Tian Shui Building recognized this as a signal that the individual had no further chance. Though the selection criteria were strict, those who had previously participated were treated leniently. If they improved, they could return weekly to showcase their progress.

The burly man felt disappointed but acknowledged his failure. He placed the sword back on the rack and descended.

The next individual immediately took his place, appearing to be a martial artist, specifically a boxer. This person had an inherent advantage since one could not carry a sword as a bodyguard, and strong unarmed skills were advantageous.

However, Su Nantian immediately discerned this man's inadequacy. He would never be accepted by the Nan Gong clan.

Su Nantian realized these individuals possessed some skill but were not exceptional. Yet, they overestimated their abilities and confidently arrived here. Hence, the Nan Gong clan's master and mistress had only selected two individuals thus far.

Su Nantian took a bite of his meal, sighed, and shook his head. "Ah, such a half-full bottle shaking—after all this, their skills are so poor."

Unbeknownst to Su Nantian, his words reached every person present.

This was due to his own carelessness. While eating and observing the performance, he had become relaxed, neglecting to control his volume.

Unexpectedly, this caused the performer on stage to erupt in anger. He had already been uncertain about his chances of passing the selection, but now, while he was earnestly performing, the Nan Gong clan's master had not interrupted him. Instead, someone nearby criticized his abilities.

Thus, the man halted his performance and addressed Su Nantian's position: "Might I inquire, sir, are you exceptionally skilled? You claim my performance is inadequate. Could you please demonstrate your abilities against me?"

Su Nantian was taken aback, realizing he had caused trouble. He had intended to observe further but now everyone's attention was on him.

Moreover, since this man had issued a challenge, the Nan Gong clan's master and Miss Yuyan also turned their gaze toward him.

Su Nantian smiled and waved his hands, declining: "Forget it. Let's not speak of it."

Yet the performer refused to let go.

"No, I sense you are quite skilled. Let me witness your abilities."

This man also had his own motives. His previous performance had not been interrupted by the Nan Gong clan, suggesting he might have a chance. If he could perform a live combat and defeat this man, it would add more brilliance to his performance.

"Does the Nan Gong clan have such rules? A two-person fight is inappropriate. If we accidentally injure each other, it would be unseemly," Su Nantian used this as an excuse to avoid the fight.

However, at that moment, the server who had previously greeted Su Nantian arrived to serve him. Hearing this, he interjected: "Sir, you also wish to participate in the selection, right? This is an opportunity for you to showcase yourself."

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian felt dizzy. He had no intention of stepping onto the stage yet and wished to observe further, as only two individuals had been selected. However, he was now disrupted by this server.

At that moment, the Nan Gong clan's mistress spoke to Su Nantian: "If you wish to participate, a two-person fight on stage would better demonstrate your prowess. However, if you do not ascend now, you will miss the chance later, as it would show your cowardice."

Su Nantian realized this was forcing him onto the stage. If he did not ascend now, he would lose the opportunity later. Thus, he had no choice but to go up.

Chapter 449: One Punch

After considering, Su Nantian accepted the situation willingly. After all, he would eventually have to step onto the stage. Fighting now might better demonstrate his abilities and make the Nan Gong clan take him more seriously.

Thus, Su Nantian stood up, set down his chopsticks, and walked toward the platform.

All eyes were drawn to Su Nantian. They found this man intriguing, as all those seeking to join the Nan Gong clan were waiting to perform. Yet this man had arrived with the intention of joining but sat at his seat, eating and criticizing others.

"Who knows if this man truly has talent or not?" one of those seeking to join the Nan Gong clan remarked to his companion, immediately drawing everyone's attention.

"Who knows? He was just pointing and criticizing earlier. Now that he's up, let's see if his abilities match his words. If he talks but can't act, that would be truly embarrassing," another responded.

"You think he seems quite confident. He might be okay," another joined the discussion.

However, others were unconvinced. One remarked: "Don't forget, everyone who first arrived at Tian Shui Building was confident. But now only two have been selected. Confidence is useless. This kid doesn't know the selection's rigor yet, so he thinks it's easy. But after experiencing some setbacks, he'll understand the truth. Just wait and see."

This man grew more animated as he recalled his own first time at Tian Shui Building. He had once believed himself extremely capable, certain he would join the Nan Gong clan. But after two years, he was still waiting here, even deciding to leave if he couldn't join this year.

While the group discussed enthusiastically, Su Nantian had already reached the combat platform. The boxer-like man appeared magnanimous, gesturing toward the weapon rack and saying: "I'll use my fists. I don't wish to gain an advantage, so if you desire a weapon, feel free to choose it without hesitation."

Su Nantian had not expected to be treated so kindly. He smiled and waved his hands: "Forget it. I'm not accustomed to these weapons, and they're too large for me. I'll fight barehanded."

The boxer scoffed: "I gave you the chance, but you didn't cherish it. Don't regret it later!"

The boxer was actually pleased. Normally, he felt something was missing in his performances on the platform, never truly showcasing his abilities. But now, someone had offered himself as a sparring partner—this would better demonstrate his prowess. The Nan Gong clan needed those who could protect them, specifically those willing to step forward. This fight would allow him to showcase his combat skills and possibly earn the master or mistress's attention, securing a place in the Nan Gong clan.

As he mused, the Nan Gong assistant immediately called out: "Are you two ready? If so, start quickly—don't waste time!"

"Come on! I'll let you strike first!" The boxer, hearing the assistant's urging, extended his hand to signal Su Nantian could attack.

In truth, the boxer was overconfident. He had no idea of Su Nantian's strength but assumed a single punch was trivial and that he would not be defeated by one. Thus, he boasted for Su Nantian to fight him.

Su Nantian smiled. Normally, he might have debated with this man, but now it was unnecessary. He had decided to display something different to enter the Nan Gong clan. The Nan Gong clan's bodyguards were already formidable, so he needed to show his superiority.

Thus, this clown provided the perfect opportunity. Su Nantian was more than happy to accept it.

With a slight smile, Su Nantian immediately threw a punch at the boxer. He used three-tenths of his strength and seven-tenths of his speed, making it impossible for most to track his fist. Yet in the next moment, everyone was still confused about what had happened when the boxer collapsed on the ground, foaming at the mouth and unconscious.

Fortunately, the Nan Gong assistant had seen many such scenes. The Nan Gong clan had anticipated potential injuries during performances and had medical staff on standby. Upon discovering the man's unconsciousness, they immediately sent him for treatment.

However, Su Nantian knew his punch had controlled the timing and force. The man was unharmed, though he looked quite pitiful.

At this moment, the Nan Gong master and mistress were extremely pleased with Su Nantian's performance. The Nan Gong mistress immediately summoned her personal bodyguard and said, "What do you think of his skill? I couldn't even see that punch."

The bodyguard replied, "He's strong. But how strong remains unclear. However, anyone stronger than this boxer would suffice. I don't know his true level or if he's qualified to be your bodyguard."

The bodyguard spoke the truth. A single punch revealed little, especially since Su Nantian had deliberately restrained his power. If he had fully unleashed it, the boxer might have been in critical condition.

Seeing that his sister had already begun discussing this man, the Nan Gong master understood she was interested. As they were competitors, such a skilled individual in her hands would mean future opposition against him. Thus, the Nan Gong master immediately began considering whether to recruit this man as well.

Chapter 450: Challenging You

After winning, Su Nantian did not descend but stood on the platform, observing the reactions below. He saw the Nan Gong mistress already discussing with someone and realized he had a chance. The Nan Gong master appeared deep in thought, possibly considering it as well.

Regardless, Su Nantian remained calm and waited for the next decision.

At this moment, the Nan Gong mistress suddenly asked: "What's your name?"

Su Nantian smiled. Fortunately, he had prepared for this. He knew his visit to the capital required concealing his identity. Before leaving the hotel in the morning, he had already disguised himself. Now, Su Nantian was completely transformed into another person. However, he had dressed as a young man in his mid-twenties, giving him an advantage in appearance.

"I am Nan Tian," Su Nantian said. He took the last two characters of his name and had prepared all information before arriving in the capital. Even if the Nan Gong clan wanted to investigate Su Nantian's background, they would only see what he wished them to see.

Of course, creating this identity had required assistance from the Dragon Group. This ensured his identity was flawless. However, he had repeatedly promised not to use this identity for any inappropriate actions before obtaining it.

"You have remarkable skills, but that single punch revealed little. Could you demonstrate more?" Nan Gong Yuyan said. She was genuinely interested in Su Nantian, but what she had seen so far was minimal. Thus, she needed another test to evaluate his abilities.

"What would you like me to demonstrate?" Su Nantian asked calmly.

"Anything, just like these people. We'll conduct a second assessment of your abilities," Nan Gong Yuyan said after thinking.

"I can't demonstrate anything on my own. Frankly, the way the Nan Gong clan selects people is quite unreliable. You should have them fight in pairs to determine who's better, instead of having them perform prearranged moves," Su Nantian said without regard for the angry glances from below. After all, his strength was beyond theirs, so he didn't care what they thought of him.

"Oh? That's interesting. So you want to fight someone now?" At this point, Nan Gong Ping interjected. After all, it had been his sister who had engaged with Su Nantian earlier. If this truly was a talent, it would end up in his sister's hands. Thus, he couldn't allow that to happen and immediately interjected.

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian nodded. He now had confidence. These two clearly had interest in him. After all, they were competitors internally. If they weren't interested, the Nan Gong master wouldn't have spoken to him.

"Good. Tell me whom you want to challenge. I'll have them come up," Nan Gong Ping pointed at the people below and said. He thought Su Nantian's words were reasonable. Indeed, having these people perform prearranged moves was inappropriate. However, initially, they had considered safety issues and hadn't adopted the fight proposal. After all, everyone knew Tian Shui Building was their family's property. If people were frequently carried out by ambulances, it would damage their reputation.

Unexpectedly, Su Nantian shook his head and said: "I don't want to fight these people. I'm here to join the Nan Gong clan, so have your bodyguards come directly."

Saying this, Su Nantian pointed at the bodyguard beside Nan Gong Yuyan and said: "I think this person is the head of your bodyguards. His skills are definitely strong. I want to fight him!"

Upon hearing this, the entire crowd was shocked. Perhaps Su Nantian didn't know this person's strength yet, but those present and the Nan Gong clan knew this individual was the strongest bodyguard by Nan Gong Yuyan's side. Even within the entire Nan Gong clan's bodyguards, he ranked second. The first-ranked bodyguard was by the current head of the Nan Gong clan. Even Nan Gong Ping's personal bodyguard couldn't match this one.

It was said this person had come from Shaolin Temple, having served as a monk for eighteen years before leaving to find work due to his family's illness. His strength was extremely formidable, and he had been recruited by the Nan Gong clan with an annual salary starting from one million. This was truly no small feat.

This bodyguard had never allowed Nan Gong Yuyan to suffer any harm. Once, when enemies ambushed the Nan Gong clan for revenge, this bodyguard had taken down twelve assailants and left none alive, knocking them out and handing them over to the police.

There were many such stories, proving this bodyguard was no ordinary person. Thus, when Su Nantian pointed at him and said he wanted to challenge him, everyone was stunned.

"I advise you to choose someone else. We have many bodyguards here. If you defeat them, you can still join the Nan Gong clan. What do you think?" Nan Gong Ping smiled and said.

But Su Nantian shook his head. "No, I want to challenge this person. If I lose, I'll never return to Tian Shui Building again. But if I win, my position must be higher than his!"

"Young man, you truly don't know your limits. My master is saying this for your own good. You can still join the Nan Gong clan by defeating others. But now you're seeking death!" The Nan Gong assistant pointed at Su Nantian, looking exasperated.

"Ha ha, interesting. If you really want to challenge me, then come on. I'll make it clear—I won't hold back, but I definitely won't kill you. However, if you're injured or crippled, I won't be responsible for that, and neither will the Nan Gong clan!" At this point, the bodyguard took off his jacket and said.

"Good, no problem. Don't worry; I won't bother you later. But I'll say the same to you—I won't hold back either," Su Nantian replied.

Chapter 451: Broken Leg

The dialogue between Su Nantian and the Nan Gong clan's bodyguard carried a strong sense of tension. The atmosphere was extremely intense.

As the bodyguard prepared to step onto the platform, Nan Gong Yuyan patted him and said: "Zhang Yu, don't be too harsh. Just give him a lesson to show he's not easy to mess with. After all, if something happens at Tian Shui Building, it would be bad for the Nan Gong clan's reputation."

Zhang Yu nodded and took off his outer suit, throwing it aside before immediately heading to the platform.

Seeing this person approach, Su Nantian smiled. If he could knock this man out, he would definitely be accepted into the Nan Gong clan. However, this time Su Nantian wouldn't act as he had before by defeating him with a single punch.

Although, based on Su Nantian's strength, one punch could have taken this man down, he decided to be cautious. After all, his purpose for coming here was clear.

If he displayed too much strength, it might raise suspicion. After all, if one's skills were so formidable, why would they only join the Nan Gong clan? Thus, he decided to fight a few rounds and then win reluctantly.

While Su Nantian was thinking, this person had already reached the platform. Zhang Yu shook his neck and said to Su Nantian: "Come on!"

Su Nantian smiled and immediately threw a punch toward Zhang Yu's face. The speed was extremely fast, but this was Su Nantian's controlled effort—slower than the seven-tenths speed he had used earlier, only five-tenths. Essentially, Su Nantian deliberately wanted the opponent to see and fight a round.

If Su Nantian had used his full power, this person would have been in trouble immediately.

However, Zhang Yu truly possessed talent. He was a Shaolin monk, and his skills were undeniable. Seeing Su Nantian's punch coming toward his face, he remained calm and dodged it. At the same time, one of his arms descended with a twist to attack Su Nantian's lower body, aiming to lift Su Nantian's leg and leave him unstable.

But Su Nantian could not miss this intention. He smiled and took a step back. At that moment, Zhang Yu's hand was just a few centimeters away from Su Nantian's leg but failed to catch it as expected.

This initial move had already made Nan Gong Yuyan and Nan Gong Ping widen their eyes. They both clearly knew Zhang Yu's skills. Now, this Su Nantian was matching him evenly, and the situation on stage was balanced without any signs of struggling.

Instead, this person seemed to effortlessly counter Zhang Yu's tricks.

"Young man, you truly have some talent. I initially underestimated you, thinking you were just a talker. Now I must take you seriously!" Zhang Yu said, then shouted loudly. He wasn't the type to be careless, but he had been annoyed by Su Nantian's provocation and wanted to give him a lesson.

However, after their initial exchange, he could confirm Su Nantian was indeed worthy of saying that. Thus, he would now take this matter more seriously and ensure he didn't lose here.

Su Nantian saw the look in Zhang Yu's eyes, confirming this man was now serious. Therefore, Su Nantian would also adjust his performance accordingly.

At that moment, Zhang Yu lunged at Su Nantian like a tiger. His speed was fast, and his hands directly reached for Su Nantian's arms, aiming to control them.

"Isn't it just about controlling my arms and targeting my lower body? I'll grant you that," Su Nantian thought. Zhang Yu's plan was clear to him.

This time, Su Nantian feigned a dodge but then his arms were still tightly controlled by Zhang Yu.

"You see, Zhang Yu didn't use full power initially; he was just testing this kid. Now that he's serious, he's caught him. And Zhang Yu is known for his lower-body skills. I think this kid has lost," the Nan Gong assistant said to Nan Gong Ping, who was nearby.

But Nan Gong Ping remained silent. He continued watching the stage's situation, unsure why he felt Su Nantian would overcome this.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu's plan was exactly as Su Nantian had anticipated. After controlling his arms, one leg immediately kicked toward Su Nantian's right leg with lightning speed.

"This is your own doing. Don't blame me!" At this moment, Su Nantian's face, which had previously looked panicked, now showed a smile. He said this to Zhang Yu.

Zhang Yu didn't understand Su Nantian's meaning. At first glance, he was clearly in the upper hand. How could this person sound like he would lose because of this kick?

But a second later, Zhang Yu understood. When his leg hadn't yet reached Su Nantian's leg, Su Nantian's leg immediately met it. Surprisingly, Su Nantian had also clashed with him directly.

If an ordinary person saw Zhang Yu's fast leg, they would instinctively retreat. At that moment, Zhang Yu could have pulled Su Nantian up and thrown him to the ground. But Su Nantian's plan was different—he didn't dodge or hide but actively met the attack. This left Zhang Yu completely unprepared.

A clear "crack" sound was heard, and the next moment, Zhang Yu fell to the ground in excruciating pain, holding his leg. His head was drenched in sweat, and he looked extremely agonized. However, Su Nantian remained unaffected, standing by the fallen Zhang Yu and muttering: "Ah, after so long, you're the first one daring to match my leg skills. My leg is famous in our village; it can even kick through half a meter thick steel plate. How could your flesh-and-blood leg be a match for it?"

After saying this, Su Nantian looked down at the crowd and said to Nan Gong Yuyan: "Miss Nan Gong, quickly call an ambulance for your bodyguard. His leg is broken. If not treated promptly, he won't recover to his former self and certainly can't be a bodyguard anymore."

Chapter 452: Delaying Time

Unexpectedly, everything happened unexpectedly. No one had anticipated Su Nantian could defeat Zhang Yu so quickly and within such a short time.

Perhaps some had initially expected this fight to end swiftly, but they had anticipated Su Nantian would be thoroughly defeated by Zhang Yu. However, the result was completely the opposite. Surprisingly, it was Zhang Yu who was now screaming.

Everyone present was stunned, including those who had previously looked down on Su Nantian.

Nan Gong Yuyan almost forgot to call for an ambulance upon hearing Su Nantian's words. Finally, it was Su Nantian's reminder that prompted her to have the Nan Gong family's steward call for an ambulance. Before the ambulance arrived, Tian Shui Building's medical staff provided Zhang Yu with simple bandages.

At this moment, Nan Gong Ping immediately ordered someone to investigate Su Nantian's identity. He intended to snatch him, although Su Nantian had shown such strength now. However, the Nan Gong clan didn't accept just anyone; they would need to verify his identity first.

But with the Nan Gong clan's resources, investigating this person's identity was not difficult. Especially since this was a prepared identity by Su Nantian, with all the necessary documents clearly visible. They could easily find information about "Nan Tian" and even trace back the story Su Nantian had made up on the taxi ride. In short, everything was arranged.

Su Nantian had no fear of his identity being discovered.

"You're incredibly bold. This is our Nan Gong clan's bodyguard. How could you strike so harshly? If Zhang Yu suffers any lasting damage, the mistress will peel your skin off!" The Nan Gong assistant said.

But he hadn't expected that Nan Gong Yuyan waved her hand and addressed Su Nantian on stage: "You've proven your strength. Indeed, it's remarkable. Would you like to follow me?"

Su Nantian hadn't expected Nan Gong Yuyan to not blame him but instead immediately begin recruiting him. However, Su Nantian had his own plans. This time he hadn't come to truly become a Nan Gong clan bodyguard but to infiltrate the Wu family. Before this, he had investigated the Nan Gong clan's dynamics. Among the two current heirs, Nan Gong Yuyan was in a dominant position.

Although Nan Gong Yuyan and Nan Gong Ping appeared evenly matched, Nan Gong Ping himself was unremarkable, even a bit of a fool. He relied on the support of several relatives within the Nan Gong clan, giving him an appearance of being able to match Nan Gong Yuyan. However, in reality, Nan Gong Yuyan completely dominated him. Additionally, from a personal standpoint, Nan Gong Yuyan was much easier to manipulate than Nan Gong Ping.

Thus, Su Nantian's plan to remain hidden without being discovered was unwise if he followed Nan Gong Yuyan. It would easily reveal his flaws and make him exhausted. Therefore, Su Nantian actually preferred to follow Nan Gong Ping.

But since Nan Gong Ping hadn't spoken yet, Su Nantian couldn't insist on joining him. Thus, he could only temporarily employ a delaying tactic.

Su Nantian smiled and said: "Thank you for Miss Nan Gong's kindness. However, I have one question to ask. Can you answer it honestly?"

Nan Gong Yuyan nodded, "Speak up. I'll answer any question I can truthfully. If I can't answer it, I'll tell you I can't. Is that acceptable?"

After hearing this, Su Nantian nodded. He was quite satisfied with Nan Gong Yuyan's attitude and said: "I've injured your most trusted bodyguard. Once he recovers, he will definitely seek revenge against me. Don't say he's kind-hearted; that's certain. After all, I broke his leg. How will you deal with it?"

Hearing Su Nantian's words, Nan Gong Yuyan fell silent. She also knew that once Zhang Yu recovered, he would definitely seek to punish Su Nantian. If she followed her nature, she would turn a blind eye and not interfere. However, Su Nantian's strength was greater than Zhang Yu's, but Zhang Yu had been by her side for a long time. Thus, she would still support Zhang Yu in the end. If Zhang Yu punished Su Nantian, she wouldn't interfere and would only comfort him afterward.

Su Nantian saw Nan Gong Yuyan remained silent, understanding her thoughts. He smiled and said: "If I join you, will you protect me? Moreover, Zhang Yu is your bodyguard. Once I'm in, even if we follow the previous agreement to give him the same treatment, from a rank perspective I would still be his subordinate. Then he would constantly give me trouble. How could I live like that?"

Nan Gong Yuyan said nothing more, as she couldn't guarantee Su Nantian's protection from Zhang Yu. She couldn't promise that she could always protect him from Zhang Yu's retaliation, and she knew Zhang Yu's temperament well.

At this moment, Nan Gong Ping realized his opportunity had finally arrived and smiled: "You're right. If you join Yuyan's side, Zhang Yu will definitely oppress you once he recovers. But if you join me instead, I can give you the highest treatment. You know that although our Nan Gong clan is wealthy and powerful, a person of Zhang Yu's level is rare. Thus, my bodyguards are relatively ordinary and not as strong as Zhang Yu. If you join me, I'll give you the same status and treatment as Zhang Yu. But in my side, you would be number one. Once you get familiar with our affairs, you can directly lead my group of bodyguards. What do you think?"

Upon hearing Nan Gong Ping's words, Su Nantian smiled. Finally, Nan Gong Ping had spoken. Actually, Su Nantian and Nan Gong Yuyan's long conversation was to give Nan Gong Ping time to make this decision. Was it because Su Nantian truly feared Zhang Yu? That was definitely not the case. He simply wanted to join Nan Gong Ping's side.

Chapter 453: The Nan Gong Clan's History

Nan Gong Ping's words fulfilled Su Nantian's wishes. He had been waiting for this moment.

But before Su Nantian could respond, Nan Gong Yuyan said: "Brother, it's not good to snatch people so openly. I haven't finished speaking yet."

Nan Gong Ping smiled: "You're right. Since you've asked this question, but you still couldn't answer it. Can you委屈 Zhang Yu? But if you can't委屈 Zhang Yu, then Nan Tian will suffer. If he joins your side and suffers, it's better not to go. Thus, joining my side would allow him to be on equal footing with Zhang Yu. Can you do that?"

"You!" Nan Gong Yuyan heard this and couldn't argue back, letting out a low growl before turning her head again.

"Nan Tian, I'll give you whatever you want. Come be my bodyguard," Nan Gong Ping said again.

Nan Gong Yuyan remained silent, as she couldn't say this. She herself knew she couldn't do it.

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian took the opportunity and immediately followed Nan Gong Ping's words. He nodded to Nan Gong Ping and said: "Thank you for Master Nan Gong's kindness. If what you said is true, I will join your side."

Su Nantian finally resolved his intention. Nan Gong Yuyan couldn't do anything, as she truly couldn't promise him the same treatment as Zhang Yu. If Zhang Yu had been with her for a shorter time or if Su Nantian's skills weren't so good, she might have balanced it. But now, she could clearly see she couldn't balance it.
