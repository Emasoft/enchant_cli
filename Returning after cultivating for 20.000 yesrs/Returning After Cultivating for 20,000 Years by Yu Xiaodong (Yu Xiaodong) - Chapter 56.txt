As a disciple of the body refinement school, Zhang An naturally knew that his sect's greatest fear was flying swords.
Remote attacks were inherently their weakness, and facing a sword cultivator who could cut through ten thousand laws from a thousand miles away was truly a disaster.
At this moment, Zhang An's only hope was that these two men's flying swords were of low quality and couldn't break through his defense.
Although he knew this wish was unrealistic, after all, they were sword cultivators known for their attack.
The atmosphere was oddly tense, but neither side had any desire to speak.
The scene became extremely awkward until they finished their skewers, and Zhu Jie and the others left first. Su Nantian and his group also stood up to follow.
„Where are you going?“
„The western suburbs!“
Since they had met here today, it was impossible to resolve things peacefully. In the city, they couldn't fight, so both sides unconsciously chose a place to battle.
The western suburbs had once been a cluster of abandoned buildings, but after countless disputes, these structures were nearly destroyed.
Perhaps it would eventually become a battlefield, or someone might buy it for redevelopment, leaving no place to fight.
„Su Nantian, I officially notify you in the name of National Security Group Six: please assist us in investigating the Fengcheng Western Suburbs 8802 incident!“
Getting out of the car, both sides indeed gathered here. Zhu Jie was the first to speak toward Su Nantian, immediately invoking national authority to establish moral high ground.
„Oh? I don't know what the incident is. As a good citizen, I'll certainly cooperate fully.“
Hearing Zhu Jie's words, Su Nantian smiled indifferently.
„If that’s the case, I’d like to ask about who attacked in the Fengcheng Western Suburbs incident.“
„Me! You already knew, didn’t you?“
„Who else?“
„The disciples of the Hezhou Wu Family. They kidnapped my girlfriend, and killing them was self-defense.“
Zhu Jie couldn’t say anything about this. The affairs of the cultivation world were different from ordinary law.
The Hezhou Wu Family had attacked first, and Su Nantian had destroyed them; outsiders had nothing to say.
But National Security Group Six wasn’t concerned with this matter. They were interested in the mysterious person who had suddenly appeared and disappeared during the battle.
For cultivators, although the state didn’t officially control them, personal records were still partially known. Including Su Nantian and Long Hu Yan, when they unleashed their cultivation powers, the state began investigating records, analyzing psychology, and assessing threat levels.
Perhaps these procedures were unknown to the individuals themselves, but as a great nation, it was natural for them to understand hidden forces within their country.
What the state couldn’t accept was that this mysterious person had suddenly appeared and disappeared during the western suburbs battle.
Besides the residual energy at the scene, there was no way to find this person’s existence!
„Hmph, you know who I’m talking about!“
„Heh, I really don’t!“
„You shouldn’t have come!“
„But I’ve already arrived!“
„……“
In a series of disjointed and strange dialogues, Su Nantian and Zhu Jie briefly demonstrated what low intelligence meant before returning to the topic. Fighting was inevitable.
If they fought, no matter who won or lost, the issue would be resolved. What else was there to say? Fight!
At first, Zhang Xiaoya showed some worry, but when the fight actually began, he adopted a spectator’s attitude with Zhang Xiaojun, sitting behind and even bringing a small stool and some sunflower seeds.
On this side was Su Nantian, Long Hu Yan, and Sun Peng. On the other side were Zhang An, Li Zhan, and Zhu Jie.
The热血3v3 battle officially began! Let’s go!
Zhang An had long anticipated this fight. Seeing it finally arrive, he wouldn’t hold back.
Zhang An immediately rushed forward, and Su Nantian chuckled, turning to meet him.
Among them, Zhang An’s cultivation was the highest; only Su Nantian could match him. Moreover, Su Nantian also eagerly awaited this battle.
Since his cultivation breakthrough, he hadn’t truly fought seriously once. Although he had the experience of a past life, his self-control over his strength hadn’t diminished.
But he wasn’t sure about his current level. After all, this time he had taken the path of sword cultivators known for their attack.
Fuyun Sword was held before him, forming a streak of light that directly met Zhang An. Mid-air, it split into one, two, three—suddenly forming a sky of sword shadows!
Each one was like reality, with sharp swords and vast emptiness!
Zhang An’s eyes twitched; he hadn’t expected this sword cultivator to have such skills, truly underestimating him.
Sun Peng, watching nearby, was also entranced. He hadn’t expected sword cultivators to have such complex transformations; he tightly gripped his Qingying, eyes filled with fervor.
This was true sword art, this was the goal Sun Peng had pursued his entire life!
Originally, Sun Peng loved swords but wasn’t overly obsessed. But after seeing Su Nantian’s flying sword, he felt an urge to pursue it endlessly!
He knew his path was correct and would continue forward without hesitation.
Sword light分化, amidst the sky of sword shadows, Zhang An continuously punched. Though he seemed to be at a disadvantage, he hadn’t suffered any injuries.
Su Nantian’s eyes narrowed slightly; his cultivation wasn’t enough.
Sword light分化 was a high-level sword technique, the foundation of setting up a sword array.
Each sword light, though fake, had to be as sharp and solid as a real flying sword!
Only then could one truly master the sword light分化, capable of forming an immense array with boundless killing intent.
Now, Su Nantian, who had previously been somewhat smug, realized his cultivation was still far behind. Currently, his sword light分化 hadn’t even been mastered.
Not only could it split into twelve shadows, but these shadows were also incredibly weak.
Under Zhang An’s iron fists, they shattered instantly—each one a hit!
Though it seemed overwhelming and in the upper hand, Su Nantian knew that if he hadn’t continuously channeled his energy to recreate the sword light, these few swords wouldn’t have been enough for Zhang An to fight.

Chapter 268:热血3v3 (Part II)
On the other side, Li Zhan had some cunning but shared Zhang An’s temperament. Seeing Zhang An easily repelled by Su Nantian,
Even Su Nantian had taken out a hovering black throne and sat on it, looking relaxed.
Li Zhan became impatient, not making a sound but rushing toward Su Nantian.
He thought he could sneak attack silently, but his every move was seen by the opponent.
As soon as he rushed forward, a long sword hovered in front of him—different from Su Nantian’s flying sword but truly floating there.
„What? Want to fight? I’ll spar with you, Sun Peng!“
Regarding Su Nantian, Sun Peng didn’t know what feelings he had. In his heart, Su Nantian was his master and benefactor, who not only taught him precious flying sword techniques but also took him in during his time of need and guided him onto the path.
So, although his strength was low, he would never allow anyone to harm Su Nantian.
Su Nantian obviously saw Li Zhan’s sneak attack but didn’t care. Seeing him blocked by Sun Peng, his lips curled slightly—this Sun Peng seemed truly reliable.
No longer ruthless and a trustworthy comrade. In modern society, people were complex; having such a person was rare.
The flying sword skills at his side weren’t as complicated as Su Nantian’s, but he had instinctively applied the sword techniques he had learned to his flying sword.
He couldn’t achieve sword light分化 or set up a sword array, but the techniques were no ordinary.
The Qingyang Sect’s sword techniques used with flying swords had a unique charm.
Li Zhan didn’t have any powerful weapons to withstand the flying sword; he could only dodge left and right, but still got wounded by the blade.
At that moment, it was truly dangerous; he couldn’t help cursing: „Sun Peng, you bastard! A traitor who killed his master! Killing the entire Qingyang Sect, now using their sword techniques with such shame!”
Hearing Li Zhan’s words, Sun Peng had no expression on his face but was secretly furious. The Qingying flew faster by three degrees, cutting Li Zhan who cried out in pain!
Regarding the Qingyang incident, it was Sun Peng’s lifelong pain. Although he had destroyed the entire Qingyang Sect, his heart was filled with sorrow.
Although he killed without hesitation, every night when it was quiet, he would weep with tears.
Human hearts were made of flesh; no one had a heart of stone. No matter what, the Qingyang Sect was where Sun Peng grew up; he spent over twenty springs and autumns there, occupying most of his life.
Destroying it himself—what kind of experience was that? Probably unimaginable, but definitely not beautiful.
Sun Peng’s words had truly touched his limit; if before it was just a fight, now he genuinely wanted to kill!
In fact, Sun Peng himself knew that in recent days, he had been tormented and his mental state wasn’t good—impulsive and easily angered, almost going mad.
He knew his condition was wrong, very close to losing control and becoming a killer who only sought bloodshed.
So he desperately controlled himself, unwilling to cause more harm. But Li Zhan had chosen death; it was no longer his fault! He wasn’t a forgiving person, and once the killing intent arose, he couldn’t stop it!
Killing intent had turned him into a demon.
The Sun Peng operating the flying sword from behind suddenly rushed toward Li Zhan, his eyes full of madness.
Zhu Jie observed from the back and frowned upon hearing Li Zhan’s words.
After all, this was a secret among ordinary people; it wasn’t good to mention it publicly.
Unexpectedly, one sentence had triggered Sun Peng’s change of heart; he was ready to fight. This truly startled Zhu Jie, who immediately intervened.
But as his spell began, a yellow spiritual energy tiger suddenly appeared beside him and swiped down!
Through this semi-transparent spiritual tiger, Zhu Jie could see Long Hu Yan smiling at him.
„Long Hu Yan, think carefully! This isn’t something you can interfere with. These people are all wanted criminals; if you side with them, it’s against the state.“
No matter if it was true or not, he immediately claimed moral high ground. It seemed this habit of National Security Group Six was common.
Unfortunately, Long Hu Yan didn’t care at all; he smiled and asked Zhu Jie: „I heard that a long time ago you chased after my little Ya? And got hurt by him...
Heh heh, today I want to see what skills you have that dare to chase after my little Ya!”
Hearing this, Zhu Jie was filled with black lines and glared at Zhang Xiaoya who was watching.
In his youth, he had indeed been naive and chased after Zhang Xiaoya. Unexpectedly, this girl was a thorny rose; instead of smelling fragrance, she left him wounded.
Especially when he was kicked in the family line...
In short, Zhu Jie had now found another true love. The past was unbearable to recall; thinking back then, he truly hadn’t been wise. He didn’t have much resentment toward Zhang Xiaoya but this black history, sister, please don’t mention it anymore!
At that moment, hearing Long Hu Yan’s words, Zhu Jie was also angry. It wasn’t a noble experience; in anger, he no longer wanted to save Li Zhan but fought with Long Hu Yan first.
Zhu Jie practiced the art of talismans; he waved his hand, two yellow papers became talismans. With a red ink brush, fire talismans flew out immediately.
These yellow papers weren’t ordinary; they were secretly made by the Taoist sect, much harder than regular yellow paper.
This wave sent them like hidden weapons directly at Long Hu Yan, and in mid-air, they transformed into a massive fireball.
The golden fiery ball was not ordinary; it had tremendous power!
Seeing the fireballs approaching, Long Hu Yan raised his eyebrows. He hadn’t expected this person to have some skills.
His spiritual tiger suddenly let out a silent roar, sending a strong gust of wind toward the two fireballs!
The originally powerful fireballs were extinguished instantly!
But Zhu Jie wasn’t upset; this was just a test. He hadn’t expected it to succeed easily.

Chapter 269: The Twelve Divine Slaughtering Spirits
While Long Hu Yan dealt with the fireballs, he had already used his hand as a brush to carve three golden talismans on himself!
Three layers of golden light flashed, and Zhu Jie’s body looked like it had been painted with gold. With the golden talismans’ enhancement, he was invulnerable!
He rushed toward Long Hu Yan’s spiritual tiger directly with his hands in claws, using a technique of eagle talons!
Even Zhang Xiaoya watching from the side was impressed with Zhu Jie. She hadn’t expected this usually timid guy to have such a direct confrontation side!
And it was powerful; he fought evenly with Long Hu Yan, not falling behind.
Zhu Jie’s fight was even, but Li Zhan’s situation was dire. Facing Sun Peng, his strength wasn’t enough, and he had also spoken out of turn, touching Sun Peng’s limit.
Sun Peng truly wanted to kill Li Zhan. At the end, he no longer used flying sword techniques but jumped into the battlefield and merged with Qingying!
Although the Qingyang Sect didn’t have flying sword techniques, their sword art was strong enough to be in the cultivation sects.
A single sword technique couldn’t attack with flying swords, but the energy gathered on the blade was naturally powerful!
The sword’s energy flowed continuously; each move had its own increasing power.
It could pierce armor, cause wounds—Li Zhan was in agony. Using his body to withstand Sun Peng’s sword, it was obviously a disadvantage.
Moreover, Sun Peng’s sword art was very good; his attack speed was much faster than Li Zhan. One moment he dodged a sword, the next another came; Li Zhan was overwhelmed and couldn’t cope.
While dodging, he still got injured; although he avoided the vital points, the left and right hits were painful.
Just as he dodged a chest attack, his body staggered; before he could steady himself, Sun Peng had changed tactics and kicked Li Zhan in the chest!
This kick sent Li Zhan sprawling to the ground, and his sword flew out of his hand.
„My life is over!“
As Li Zhan fell, he knew it was bad. He wanted to dodge but couldn’t catch up with the flying sword’s speed!
But how could he give up? He tried a rolling dragon move but couldn’t move at all; cold sweat flowed from his forehead!
Because the Qingying that had flown out was hovering above his head! The sharp tip lightly pressed against his forehead, and he could feel the coolness of metal touching his skin!
The light shadow had become sentient; its sharp energy kept emerging!
Li Zhan felt his forehead was no longer under his control, and it could be lost at any moment.
At this moment, Sun Peng stood in the battlefield with his right hand as a sword finger, holding a sword technique to point at Li Zhan.
His nose was breathing heavily, his face had a fierce expression; his eyes were full of killing intent, bloodshot and red!
At this moment, Li Zhan’s life was in his hands!
If he wanted to, he could take it instantly. Even Zhang An couldn’t rescue him.
But just then, Sun Peng hesitated; his heart was conflicted.
Sun Peng truly had the killing intent for Li Zhan, wanting to kill him immediately. But after thinking carefully, he felt it wasn’t worth it; now that he had killed the entire Qingyang Sect, although there was a reason, he was still under National Security attention!
If he killed Li Zhan at this moment, it would be hard to resolve things peacefully!
After all, the conflict with Qingyang was still personal; but if he killed a National Security agent, it would be truly big trouble!
Rarely, in his killing intent, he still maintained a bit of reason.
Sun Peng controlled the flying sword and carefully moved it aside, placing it on the ground near Li Zhan’s ear.
„Go!“
A furious shout came from between his teeth. Li Zhan didn’t say much, quickly got up and stood behind, but he had lost.
Sun Peng and Li Zhan’s battle was over; the other two sides were still fighting fiercely.
Zhang An kept yelling, his ice gloves had already been on his hands, but he couldn’t deal with Su Nantian’s reckless flying sword.
At this moment, he was trapped ten meters away from Su Nantian; ten meters, which usually passed in an instant, but now felt like a divine punishment!
This short ten meters, Zhang An couldn’t cross. The floating sword in the air split into twelve blades; although this wasn’t a complete division, it was still fragile. But setting up a sword array was more than enough!
At this moment, Su Nantian’s sword array was called the Twelve Divine Slaughtering Spirits!
Does this name sound invincible? Actually, this sword array was Su Nantian’s creation. When he first entered the cultivation world, his strength was low, so he had to rely on array techniques.
Eventually, he created this twelve-branch array, which he named the Twelve Divine Slaughtering Spirits!
Now modifying this array, it could naturally become a sword array.
Actually, if one truly wanted to unleash the power of the Twelve Divine Slaughtering Spirits, it would require twelve divine weapons as array foundations—five yin five yang swords and two heavenly and earthly swords.
Only then would the Twelve Divine Slaughtering Spirits be fully refined. But currently, Su Nantian only had this one Fuyun Sword; using sword light division to set up the array was just a shadow.
At first, when facing Zhang An, Su Nantian had some concerns; after all, Zhang An’s strength was far beyond his. The pressure of the rank wasn’t easy to erase.
But when he actually fought, he realized that his understanding of the Earth’s cultivation world was still too shallow.
After all, although Earth had a brilliant civilization, it only had 5000 years of history. Compared to the cultivation world’s inheritance of tens of thousands of years, it was incomparable.
At the same rank, Zhang An’s power was much weaker than that of the cultivation world.
But upon discovering this, Su Nantian had no contempt at all. In such an environment and conditions, Zhang An could still cultivate to the peak of Qi Refinement, even with many innate masters.
Su Nantian truly admired him; compared to the cultivation world’s unchanging nature, there was more thinking and creation here.
Although this state was still shallow, it shocked Su Nantian deeply.
For example, Long Hu Yan’s inherited仙武 (Xian Wu) sect—there was no such thing in the cultivation world. It wasn’t that Xian Wu’s techniques were stronger than those of the cultivation world; it was just that they hadn’t thought of this.

Chapter 270: The Origin and Reasons
Of course, talking about these things was too far. Now Su Nantian’s task was to use Zhang An's pressure to transform his Twelve Divine Slaughtering Spirits array into the Twelve Divine Slaughtering Sword Array!
The last two thousand years of research on arrays, the Twelve Divine Slaughtering Spirits was his life's work. Although he mainly cultivated sword techniques, this array couldn’t be abandoned!
Moreover, after analysis, Su Nantian found that using swords to set up arrays was very fitting with the Twelve Divine Slaughtering Spirits, even producing a power not weaker than the original array. It also had a sharp edge of sword techniques.
But if one truly wanted to walk this path, it would require a lot of things.
Twelve divine swords; each required top-tier materials to forge, capable of bearing the divine spirits’ power.
Plus the sword’s own flying sword, a total of thirteen flying swords; each was a money-hungry item, no room for error.
Now, Su Nantian only had some iron and steel, refined into the Fuyun Sword. It could barely serve as a prototype for his own flying sword, but to refine twelve divine swords was impossible.
Of course, the Twelve Divine Slaughtering Sword Array that Su Nantian created was just his own name. It had nothing to do with the legendary Twelve Ancestors summoning Pangu’s true body and the great array.
The twelve divine spirits here referred to humans’ twelve negative emotions: anxiety, anger, sorrow, regret, impatience, complaints, resentment, grief, depression, fear, suppression, and tension.
As long as Su Nantian could refine these twelve divine swords, he could not only eliminate his own twelve negative emotions but also absorb all the human-generated negative energy in the world.
It was somewhat similar to the god path, but without followers or offerings. As long as there were intelligent beings, these negative energies would continuously emerge.
And these... were Jiang Ci’s best nourishment!
Before today, Jiang Ci hadn’t thought of a good way to pass on the essence of his past life—the Twelve Divine Slaughtering Spirits array.
Today, using sword light division to set up an array was just a spontaneous action. Previously, the simple division of sword lights to deal with Zhang An had little effect and was constantly broken by Zhang An.
Inspired, he set up the array, which surprisingly worked!
He then carefully analyzed it and found it feasible. But the materials for these flying swords were really hard to find; he sighed helplessly, this was no good. After all, under the premise of ensuring micro-profit, it had to be economical. There was no such good thing.
Heaven’s law is loss, and it's not perfect. Not everything can be as one wishes; after all, there is loss for gain and gain must have loss.
In his past life, the Twelve Divine Slaughtering Spirits array hadn’t grown to its final stage. Although the cultivation world had more life than Earth, in reality, there weren’t that many commoners. Most were cultivators and beasts.
Even commoners were under the control of various dynasties, spending their daily lives devoted to worshiping the Emperor.
So Su Nantian could absorb only a few of these twelve spirits.
But in this life on Earth, most were commoners and numerous. Every city produced countless negative energies daily.
For Su Nantian, these were all sacred places for cultivation!
Su Nantian sat on the iron throne, supporting his chin with one hand, looking somewhat bored. Although in reality, his mind was rapidly turning, trying to simulate the array's various changes, but to others, he looked like he was just sitting there daydreaming.
And in the distance, that person who should have fought against him—Zhang An—was being constantly attacked by a flying sword, surrounded and mercilessly killed!
Li Zhan, who had already lost, watched this strange battle with fear.
He hadn’t expected Su Nantian’s strength to be so变态 and when fighting against Zhang An, he still had time to daydream, even sitting on the throne motionless.
It was truly disheartening to have no will to resist.
Long Hu Yan and Zhu Jie’s battle was much more intense, both displaying great power and fighting enthusiastically.
But it was just that; neither could harm the other.
Seeing Su Nantian so strong, they fought without much interest and eventually stopped.
The only one remaining was Su Nantian sitting on the hovering black throne, one hand supporting his chin, eyes vacant, not knowing what he was thinking.
Ten meters away, there was a place with sword lights everywhere, cold and sharp—twelve flying swords forming a great array. Within this array, Zhang An roared continuously and shouted.
He tried to break through the array but failed every time.
Plus, everyone outside had stopped fighting and watched him like a monkey show.
This made Zhang An, who never gave up, feel defeated and sat on the ground to be killed or whatever.
Su Nantian was in the middle of simulating the array when it suddenly went silent, interrupting his thoughts. He looked down and saw Zhang An sitting on the ground, looking like he was ready to be killed.
„Hmph, you didn’t last long!“
Su Nantian chuckled and waved his hand; the sword energy disappeared. Fuyun returned to his forehead, forming a single sword mark that flickered before disappearing.
„How about it? Now we can talk seriously, right? Starting with a fight is never good. After all, I’m a reasonable person.“
Su Nantian’s words sounded reasonable at first. But looking at the situation, you were sitting on a throne while others stood around—this didn’t seem right.
It felt like the so-called “reason” you spoke of was different from what we knew...
Regardless of whether Su Nantian’s reason was truly reasonable, the final outcome of war always took place at the negotiation table.
Of course, the content of negotiations would be based on the result of war.
Su Nantian and Zhang An’s battle certainly couldn’t be called a war, but the result was the same.
After a while, these people returned to Zhang Xiaojun’s barbecue restaurant near the school.
Eating grilled skewers, but the positions had changed—two groups sat at one table, naturally Su Nantian took the main seat.
He threw a boiled peanut into his mouth and mumbled: „Speak up, what department are you from? What’s the purpose of your visit?
I don’t believe that a silly guy at the hospital could command you with just one phone call. If it were true, this country’s department would be too cheap.“

Chapter 271: Heading to the Capital
As he spoke, three more peanuts were thrown in. It was true that Zhang Xiaojun had some secret recipe; the taste was really good.
Zhang An glared at Zhu Jie twice, but before they had clarified the situation, they had already fought. Although he loved fighting, this fight was too mysterious.
Feeling Zhang An’s gaze, Zhu Jie frowned and thought: You’ve fought many糊涂 fights before. Last year in the capital, you beat your own father-in-law; who else could it be?
But Zhu Jie didn’t dare to say this out loud. After all, in this world, might makes right; he couldn’t fight Zhang An and better not to provoke.
„Well... we are from National Security Group Six, under the Office of Domestic Security and Internal Affairs.
Our main responsibility is to investigate and monitor domestic superpowers, including but not limited to cultivators, warriors, psychics, religious followers, and others.
The main purpose of this visit is...“
Zhu Jie hadn’t finished speaking when Su Nantian raised his hand to interrupt. His eyes glowed as he confirmed again:
„Dragon Group?“
Hearing this name, the members of National Security Group Six exchanged glances, somewhat helpless but nodded.
Actually, the so-called Dragon Group and National Security Group Six were completely different concepts. The former came from a web novel and was well-known to the public.
National Security Group Six, the Office of Domestic Security and Internal Affairs was a genuine national agency; how could it be equated with a fictional organization from a novel!
But they couldn’t deny it either. Since the name “Dragon Group” had appeared, anyone who knew the truth called them Dragon Group and no longer used that long name.
Even the No. 1 leader had once joked: „Dragon Group, inheriting dragon’s spirit and guarding dragon's will. It fits you well!
As for the jokes on the internet, they were a better cover. After all, great hidden things are in the city; truth and falsehood—why care too much?“
Therefore, National Security Group Six members mostly disliked the name “Dragon Group,” but they had to accept it.
Then Su Nantian asked about the so-called “others,” understanding roughly that they referred to some mutated tribes, such as werewolves and vampires in the West, certain onmyōji from Japan, and zombies in China.
After understanding roughly, Su Nantian finally understood why these people had come to find him.
It was simply that a force not yet monitored in Fengcheng had suddenly appeared, capable of threatening public security.
The state needed to control and register this force.
Although Su Nantian disliked this feeling, cultivation and practice pursued freedom. The biggest difference between “cultivation” and “divinity” was that the latter was about freedom.
As it is said, „Morning travel to the North Sea and evening to Cangwu; eating morning dew and clouds...“
This was what cultivators sought. If they were registered, their freedom would be lost; it felt like a criminal without prison.
Su Nantian definitely opposed this, although according to Zhu Jie’s words, if registered, the state would provide resources and even additional subsidies if he joined Dragon Group.
This...
Su Nantian thought about his Twelve Divine Slaughtering Sword Array and felt a sudden urge. He was truly poor.
Su Nantian agreed, which was entirely within Zhu Jie’s expectations, but he didn’t ask about who the other person was at Fengcheng Western Suburbs. Although his heart was shocked, thinking it might be this Sun Peng, he didn’t ask out loud.
It wasn’t kind to pry into others’ secrets. Especially since they had lost in the previous fight, if they had won, some questions would be easier to ask. But since they lost, they had no right.
Su Nantian and Sun Peng successfully registered and agreed to go to the capital for testing, even showing a desire to join Dragon Group. Although Zhu Jie couldn’t decide alone, it was definitely a good sign.
Simple registration, Sun Peng and others were registered in Fengcheng, as their strength wasn’t high and didn’t require a high level.
But Su Nantian was different; he couldn’t be registered by Zhang An and others. He needed to return with Zhu Jie to the capital headquarters, not only register but also undergo strength testing and discuss Su Nantian’s desire to join Dragon Group.
Su Nantian wanted to join Dragon Group, although it was a sudden idea, it wasn’t unreasonable.
The main reason was that Zhu Jie casually said one sentence: in Dragon Group’s warehouse, there were various treasures and unknown items.
In Su Nantian’s view, these were all treasures; Earth people didn’t know how they did it—perhaps there was a loss in the inheritance. Their use of materials was too crude.
Like Hezhou Wu Family, a small cultivation family, used iron to build a gate—this was truly wasteful.
In Su Nantian’s mind, there were probably many such things in Dragon Group; he could go and plunder first.
From Fengcheng to the capital, it wasn’t very far but also not near. Jiang Ci naturally wouldn’t choose to drive; he and Zhang An took a plane together.
First class! Honestly, this was Su Nantian’s first time flying in first class!
Although he had ridden spaceships and flown swords, driven magical tools for two thousand years in the cultivation world.
But he thought these various things could never compare to a plane, especially first class. After all, none of those magical tools or spaceships had beautiful ladies.
„Hello, sir, I’m glad to serve you. Is there anything I can help with?“
„Missy, hello! I’m heartbroken. Can you comfort me?“
Hearing Su Nantian’s words, Zhu Jie, Li Zhan, Zhang An and others all turned their heads.
They had taken this plane many times; they had met this flight attendant before. She was definitely a fiery character. Su Nantian’s flirtation would surely get no good result.
But to everyone's surprise, this flight attendant bent down and smiled politely: „Sir, please don’t be discouraged. If there’s anything you can tell me, I can at least share your pain.“
It turned out that flirting with a flight attendant wasn’t something anyone could do, but Su Nantian could. Not because of anything else—only his looks!
Su Nantian saw this beautiful flight attendant and smiled, looking satisfied and happy.

Chapter 272: Dragon Group in the Capital
