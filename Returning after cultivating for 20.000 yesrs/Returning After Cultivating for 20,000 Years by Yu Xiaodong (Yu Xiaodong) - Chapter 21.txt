"From his words, it's not hard to infer that this old man must be a master of jade carving—afraid that Su Nantian would ruin the fine jade."

Before Su Nantian could respond, Lin Suyun, who had remained silent all along, suddenly spoke.

"How dare you speak like that? Does that mean my husband's jade carving is ruining the jade?"

"Being unable to do something yourself doesn't mean others can't."

Saying this, Lin Suyun removed the ring from her finger and gently placed it on the bar counter. She then addressed the manager and the old man: "This is a jade ornament my husband gave me. If anyone can replicate it, I'll say nothing. But if they can't, then please just keep quiet."

This was the first time Su Nantian had seen such a bold Lin Suyun. Although she had always been lively and cute, she had never shown such a dominant side before.

At this moment, the elderly man no longer cared about etiquette. He had practically leaned over the bar counter, holding a magnifying glass in his hand and carefully examining the jade ring.

"Hmph. Being able to produce it doesn't mean you can truly create it! There are plenty of people with high aspirations but low abilities these days. Look at He Lao's hands, then look at yours—do you really think you can do this kind of work?"

The manager seemed to dislike Lin Suyun's smug attitude and turned to Su Nantian, saying: "You don't know why you're angry at her, but you take it out on me. Well, I don't know, men should bear the storms for their wives—nothing big!"

"I can do it. If I can't, what's it to you? Six Great福珠宝 is running a business; I came to buy it, not refusing to pay. What's the problem?"

"Fine, this customer has no issues. However, the jade material isn't within Six Great福's product range, so you can go to the next stop."

"Okay," Su Nantian shrugged indifferently. After all, jade was just jade to him.

As he was about to retrieve the ring, the elderly man who had been fixated on the rose jade ring suddenly looked up at Su Nantian and said: "Young man, did you really make this piece?"

"Yes! Of course I did. Why? Don't you believe me, old man?"

"I don't know if He Lao believes it, but I certainly don't. Unless you carve one right now to prove your skills, how can I believe you have such techniques?"

The speaker was the manager, who now held two pieces of jade and the previously agreed 500 yuan.

"Provocation? Little girl, has anyone ever told you your provocation is really crude?"

Chapter 93: Ruyi

"Little girl, has anyone ever told you your provocation is really crude?"

Su Nantian chuckled and cast a sly glance at the manager before snatching back the ring from Lin Suyun on the counter.

"Since He Lao doesn't believe it, I'll demonstrate. Provocation?巧了, I just happen to fall for this!"

Su Nantian's words made He Lao's face break into a radiant smile, like a chrysanthemum. He paid no heed to the manager's darkening expression and was as excited as a child.

"Are you going to carve right now? Do you need any tools? I have a complete set of manual chisels here, and even some electric equipment in the workshop nearby. Please follow me..."

Seeing the old man's excitement, Su Nantian felt his mood slightly ease.

Although he was angry at the manager's snobbish attitude, this He Lao was a genuine artisan with no complicated thoughts.

Six Great福 Jewelry was an industry leader in this area. Looking at the various jade carvings on display, Su Nantian admitted that He Lao was quite skilled among ordinary people.

Though not reaching the level of a national master, he was close enough to be nationally renowned. Otherwise, the manager wouldn't have treated him so respectfully.

Unfortunately, they had encountered Su Nantian. His technique of using spirit awareness to control fire and refine artifacts was beyond ordinary people's capabilities.

Seeing the old man's excitement, Su Nantian smiled and said: "No need. Just give me a secluded space—I think this place is perfect!"

As he spoke, Su Nantian walked to a private reception room on the side. Due to privacy protection, the room was fully enclosed.

Su Nantian waved his hand, asking everyone else to leave. He then took the jade material from the manager's hands.

Using spirit awareness to sense it, he was slightly surprised!

This was actually a Spirit Jade—unbelievable. Spirit Jade refers to jade containing spiritual energy but not reaching the level of spirit stones, serving as a transitional stage from ordinary jade to spirit stones.

Even so, it still surprised Su Nantian. The spiritual energy on Earth was truly thin.

Otherwise, he wouldn't have resorted to collecting faith through the masses for cultivation.

Although he had previously obtained five spirit stones in one go, boosting his cultivation, such things weren't easily obtainable.

To produce a Spirit Jade in such thin natural conditions was astonishing, even for Su Nantian.

After a brief sensing, he understood the reason. The more translucent the jade, the more natural patterns it formed—these were called "ice flowers" in the industry.

This high-quality jade material also contained ice flowers, and it was precisely these ice flowers that made this jade a Spirit Jade.

Under Su Nantian's perception, the ice flowers inside the jade seemed to be subtly connected, forming a pattern.

Although there were some differences in details, overall it was a natural Converging Spirit Array. It was because of Earth's thin spiritual energy that this jade could have become a spirit crystal without the array.

After a brief contemplation, he made his decision. A purple spiritual fire emerged from his fingertips, beginning to smelt the entire jade material.

Since there was no need to re-embed the array, this refinement was effortless for Su Nantian. The entire jade gradually melted into a clear stream.

Under the influence of spirit awareness, it continuously gathered and transformed, shaping its final form.

The main reason Su Nantian agreed to refine this jade was He Lao. In the old man's eyes, Su Nantian saw only a pursuit of art, no worldly disputes or malicious intentions.

An old man who devoted his life to carving art was certainly worthy of Su Nantian's respect. If in the cultivation world, such an elder could have carved his own path.

Under Su Nantian's spirit awareness, the jade liquid gradually took shape. Ultimately, a long piece of jade transformed into a Ruyi (如意), with clouds and dragons soaring as if it were the legendary Three Treasures Ruyi.

Moreover, Su Nantian reinserted the naturally formed Converging Spirit Array into it. With this array, spiritual energy would continuously gather within it.

He Lao held the Ruyi for a long time, and with spiritual energy's effect, it would be hard to fall ill. Although not truly extending life, it could allow him to live a long and healthy life.

No need to carve the array, so it didn't take too long. About ten minutes later, Su Nantian had completed the task.

But then he thought, if he left too quickly, people might suspect him again. It would be hard to explain.

So he sat on the sofa in the private room and started eating some fruit. Outside, a group of people were anxiously waiting.

After about an hour, Su Nantian had taken a short nap and finally walked out of the private reception room calmly.

But no one in the crowd looked at him. Their eyes were all fixated on the jade color in his arms.

"Old He, how do you find this Ruyi?"

Seeing the manager's eyes wide open, Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing's faces naturally showed victorious smiles. Although Gao Jingjing hadn't spoken much, she had no goodwill towards this manager.

It was truly despicable—daring to doubt her Nantian. It was unforgivable!

"Good! Very good!"

Old He was truly excited, nervously wiping his hands on his pants repeatedly before putting on a pair of gloves and taking the jade Ruyi from Su Nantian's hands.

He then used various tools to conduct a comprehensive inspection. This jade Ruyi was 23 centimeters long and weighed 352 grams, qualifying as a medium-sized jade handpiece.

Seeing Old He's obsession, Su Nantian smiled slightly and didn't mind. He extended his hand to take the other piece of jade, then left with Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing.

As for the jade Ruyi, Su Nantian had intended to give it to Old He. Leaving it here was fine; he didn't believe Six Great福 would quarrel with Old He over this Ruyi.

After all, for Six Great福, Old He was a money tree. They wouldn't want to offend him over a small matter.

Chapter 94: Wu Lianxing's Phone Call

After leaving Six Great福, Lin Suyun seemed in a good mood and continued shopping with Gao Jingjing for a long time, while Su Nantian was reduced to a follower.

When they returned home, it was already evening. Su Nantian still had to buy groceries and cook, becoming a genuine househusband—truly pitiful.

Lin Suyun naturally knew Su Nantian's physical strength. Doing some chores was trivial, and his current pitifulness was feigned.

So she naturally took the bags back to her room. Today's purchases weren't many, mostly daily necessities, and a few clothes for Su Nantian. As for herself, she hadn't bought much.

Gao Jingjing saw Su Nantian cooking alone and felt uneasy, so she came to the kitchen to help. After several rounds of chaos, Su Nantian had no courage to let her stay in the kitchen. He was truly worried that Gao Jingjing would explode the gas if she stayed a bit longer, even though he was at the sixth level of refining energy and supposedly invulnerable.

This girl's destructive power was just too great!

After a short time, the aroma of food filled the whole house. If initially seeing Su Nantian's good cooking skills and quickly making a good meal surprised Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing, now they had already gotten used to it and ate without any guilt.

After finishing the meal, Lin Suyun washed the dishes. Su Nantian sat on the sofa and didn't feel like moving. However, at this moment, his phone suddenly rang.

"Hello, who are you looking for?" Gao Jingjing answered the call. Su Nantian didn't even want to take two steps.

"Oh, I see."

Gao Jingjing handed the phone to Su Nantian and said: "It's for you. The voice sounds like a beautiful woman!"

Hearing Gao Jingjing's words, Lin Suyun frowned slightly. Although she knew it wasn't right, she still felt a pang of jealousy. Her boyfriend was too popular with women, and various women had feelings for him, which made Lin Suyun very uncomfortable.

"Hello, this is Su Nantian."

"Hello, I'm Wu Lianxing. We met before, do you remember?"

Hearing Wu Lianxing's words, Su Nantian's mind instantly conjured up a beautiful woman's image. If he were an ordinary person, he wouldn't remember, but for beauties, he never forgot.

"Oh, it's you. What's up?"

The tea house pianist, of course, he remembered.

"Mr. Su, you remember that I told you before my master wanted to invite you to participate in a variety show. The recording time is tomorrow. Do you have time?"

Hearing Wu Lianxing's words, Su Nantian finally remembered he had a show to record. The vice director of the television station had asked him several times and even accepted his money.

"Tomorrow? Yes, I have time tomorrow!"

"That's great. Mr. Su, I'll meet you at the Moonlight Tea House tomorrow morning at 8 o'clock and send you to the recording studio. Is that okay?"

"Okay."

They briefly discussed the recording matters, and Su Nantian hung up. He noticed that Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing's four eyes were all staring at him.

"Huh? What's wrong with the two of you?"

Su Nantian was confused, not knowing why, but under these four big eyes, he felt a bit guilty.

"Who was it?"

Lin Suyun asked Su Nantian casually, but even Gao Jingjing could see her dissatisfaction.

"It's Wu Lianxing. You know, the pianist we met at the Moonlight Tea House.

Tomorrow, the vice director of the television station invited me to participate in a variety show. She informed me."

Seeing Lin Suyun was clearly unhappy, Su Nantian truthfully explained but didn't mention it was Wu Lianxing's master who invited him.

"Is that true? The vice director of the television station invited you to participate in a program, why did she inform you?"

"Ah... I don't know."

Hearing Su Nantian's answer, Lin Suyun was clearly unsatisfied. She didn't say anything but stared at Su Nantian without blinking, making him feel uncomfortable all over.

"Okay, okay. I'll tell you the truth!"

He briefly explained to Lin Suyun about Wu Lianxing's master inviting him to participate in the program. Lin Suyun then let it go, but she wanted to go with him tomorrow.

Su Nantian had no objections. After all, there was nothing else to do. If she wanted to go, it wasn't a big deal. Arranging an audience seat in the studio was nothing.

As for Gao Jingjing... well, this little girl had already voluntarily stood behind Lin Suyun, indicating she would go along.

The next morning, Lin Suyun drove Su Nantian and Gao Jingjing to the Moonlight Tea House.

Early in the morning, there weren't many people drinking tea. Suddenly seeing a sports car parked at the entrance of the teahouse, everyone felt strange.

After all, it was a teahouse. Most people coming and going were elderly, so sports cars weren't common here.

However, some young people came here to discuss matters, which didn't draw much attention.

Su Nantian got out of the car. On his left was Lin Suyun, and on his right was Gao Jingjing—truly a scene of left arm and right arm, making people who passed by glance at him repeatedly.

Men saw this scene and felt full of envy. These two women on either side weren't ordinary, they were definitely top-tier beauties.

Women saw this scene and muttered a curse under their breath, but they secretly wanted to replace them.

Seeing Su Nantian's car arrive, Wu Lianxing hurried downstairs to greet him. Seeing the two women on either side, she felt a bit bitter and was momentarily dazed.

Lin Suyun realized that Wu Lianxing had feelings for her boyfriend. Fortunately, she came today; otherwise, who knows what might have happened.

Although Lin Suyun was kind-hearted, she wouldn't like to share her boyfriend with others! Yao Lina was her best friend and confidante, and Lin Suyun didn't know how to refuse.

Gao Jingjing was a pure and lovely girl. Even Lin Suyun, as a woman, found it hard to feel jealous of her.

But she didn't want any more girlfriends for her! And Su Nantian was a seed of being sentimental. Every time she thought about this, Lin Suyun felt her head hurt.

Chapter 95: Start

"Miss Wu, Miss Wu, let's go?"

Seeing the beautiful woman in front of him seemed a bit dazed, Su Nantian waved his hand before her and called out.

"Ah! Oh!"

Wu Lianxing was caught daydreaming, feeling a bit shy. Her face turned red almost to her neck.

"Let's go, let's go! Let's go!"

Wu Lianxing went to the parking lot and took her car, leading the way. Lin Suyun drove a Rolls-Royce Phantom sponsored by Gao Qiguang behind her.

Wu Lianxing's car was a small Beetle, with a淡 yellow body and a slightly rounded design. Its compact size made it suitable for modern urban women.

As for Su Nantian's Rolls-Royce Phantom, it was not suitable for city roads. Driving here was just to attract attention and show off.

From speed alone, in this crowded situation, the Rolls-Royce Phantom wasn't necessarily much faster than the Beetle.

Stopping and starting, the speed was not fast. When they arrived at Fengcheng Television Station at 9:30 am, it was already morning.

At 2 pm, the audience started entering. There was a rehearsal at 10 am in the morning.

Seeing it was almost time, Deputy Director Zhang was really scared. If Su Nantian suddenly left him hanging at the last minute, he would be in big trouble. This wasn't just a small mistake but could be called a production failure.

Even if it was a recorded show, such a big problem would make his position as deputy director unstable. After all, there were many people watching from the back.

How many eyes were behind him waiting for him to make a mistake? As soon as there was an opportunity, these people would rush in like wolves smelling blood.

"My little ancestor! You've finally arrived. Come into the studio for rehearsal, you're the last one!"

Seeing Su Nantian finally arrived, Deputy Director Zhang immediately had someone take him into the inner room to get makeup. He was about to start his rehearsal.

Makeup, whether in this life or the previous one, Su Nantian had never experienced it before. However, after the makeup artist took out a bunch of bottles and containers and drew on Su Nantian's face, she finally sighed and just controlled the oil.

It was because Su Nantian's skin was too smooth and delicate. Even a professional makeup artist couldn't find where to modify.

The brief rehearsal took over an hour, which made Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing very bored and almost fell asleep.

Although variety shows looked lively and fun on TV, the actual filming wasn't easy.

At noon, they had lunch at the television station's cafeteria. Although it wasn't as good as a five-star chef, the food at Fengcheng Television Station's cafeteria was actually quite good.

Su Nantian ate happily. Although the taste wasn't great, he didn't care much about food.

If it weren't so shocking to not eat, Su Nantian could even choose short-term fasting to reduce impurities in his body and facilitate spiritual energy cultivation.

Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing, however, were not happy with their meals. They had gotten used to Su Nantian's cooking and felt something was missing when they ate outside food, even though the food was quite good.

For the afternoon recording session, Su Nantian took it seriously because he needed to increase his fame and become the biggest star in Fengcheng, even across Jiangzhou, and worldwide. This would greatly help his cultivation.

This method of cultivation was not Su Nantian's own creation but a heritage from an ancient sect he encountered in the cultivation world.

Of course, this sect didn't have disciples become big stars. Instead, they built a temple brick by brick and tile by tile.

When the place was sacred and people worshipped it sincerely, a force called faith would appear on him.

This power was very strong and endless as long as the believers didn't stop. It was suitable for Su Nantian now.

After all, Earth's spiritual energy was too thin. Cultivation was difficult everywhere. If he relied on this thin spiritual energy to break through to the innate realm, it would be more realistic than hoping he would be transported again.

The ancient heritage of this sect was different. It didn't focus on spiritual energy but more on the power of believers' faith.

This power focused more on the number of people, emotional fluctuations, and gatherings. It was suitable for Su Nantian now because he was in a big city of China, where other things might be lacking but people were plenty.

Of course, in the 21st century, there were no demons or gods. The golden body and Buddha images also needed to be adjusted.

The relationship between stars and fans was naturally suitable for this method. This was the path Su Nantian was currently taking.

Although compared to believers, fans could only gather a little power, they were still in the category of general believers. But with so many people, what difference did it make!

After finishing lunch, the afternoon filming finally started.

The crew had already led the audience in. The host of Fengcheng Television Station was doing a brief introduction on the bed.

"Relax, thank you. This is a large variety show sponsored by Cool Fans exclusively called 'I Love the Sound'!

Welcome to watch, I'm the host of this episode, Zhang Gang!"

With Zhang Gang's opening, there was a wave of applause representing the official start of the program.

"Thank you, thank you! We all know that in recent years, ancient-style music has become popular across the country and even worldwide. Not only in our country but also Western countries have started to like ancient-style songs.

Today, we've invited a master who is an expert in ancient-style music and a nationally renowned musician, Master Fang. Let's welcome him with applause!

With Master Fang's appearance, there was another wave of thunderous applause. This Master Fang was Wu Lianxing's master, a true veteran artist with no fake elements and real talent.

Previously, Wu Lianxing said there was a young man who played the guqin and could naturally integrate emotions into it, making people immersed and unable to resist.

Master Fang didn't believe it. He had played the guqin for decades and still couldn't say he could enter that ethereal state anytime.

Moreover, integrating emotions into it was even more profound than his own immersion. It wasn't just talk.

Chapter 96: Immortal

But I know my disciple well. Wu Lianxing never lied to me, nor was she someone who couldn't distinguish between high and low.

So there were only two possibilities. One was that this young man truly had a great talent and reached the peak of guqin, while the other was that this young man had deceived my disciple with some method and made her believe firmly.

No matter what method this young man used, Master Fang had developed enough interest in him. No matter what, this young man's achievements at such a young age were remarkable in guqin.

If he could deceive my disciple, Master Fang would have a bit of admiration for him and wanted to take him as a disciple.

Today's meeting with Su Nantian was largely out of curiosity.

Su Nantian wasn't the main guest, so he didn't have a long stage time. When the program was almost halfway through, Zhang Gang introduced him and he finally took the stage.

"Today's event also has a very popular ordinary person. With just an handsome and tough face, he has gained countless female fans!

Later, a video was released, revealing that this person wasn't just good-looking but also had a hand at playing the guqin, even said to be no less than a master!

So who is this young man who seems to have stepped out of an ancient painting, known as the outstanding youth in the world? Tell me please!"

It must be said that Zhang Gang was good at mobilizing the audience's atmosphere. Under his encouragement, the audience continuously called Su Nantian's name, one after another.

Among the 300 attendees, a large part came because of Su Nantian's name. As for those who truly came for Master Fang, they were few.

After all, various old artists rarely received the favor of young people.

At this moment, Su Nantian wore an ancient costume and slowly stepped onto the stage. Unknowingly, Zhang Gang had quietly left, and dry ice smoke floated on the stage.

Su Nantian walked forward in this dry ice, his legs invisible, as if an immortal descending from the clouds.

In fact, he could not yet fly in the air, but with the rising dry ice current, it was easy for him to glide a short distance.

This showy entrance had truly cost much effort.

His hands were behind his back, gazing ahead without looking sideways. At this moment, Su Nantian looked like the gods from nine heavens descending to earth.

When he reached the center of the stage, his body actually rose a few inches and sat cross-legged on the dry ice mist!

The entire audience erupted in gasps. Everyone stared at Su Nantian on stage, not knowing how he did it.

Not only the audience but also the television station staff didn't know how Su Nantian achieved this effect. After all, there was no such part in the rehearsal.

It was also because the rehearsal didn't truly release dry ice. Even if he wanted to, it couldn't achieve this effect.

As Su Nantian sat down and waved his hand forward, the rising white mist gathered in his hands, forming a pure white guqin!

"Magic?"

Maybe this was everyone's thought in the crowd. It was too shocking.

Everyone was tense, watching the actions on stage without making a sound, afraid of missing the wonderful moment with a blink.

Su Nantian had no expression, as if he hadn't seen the masses below. In front of him was only one thing—this white guqin.

He extended his pale and slender fingers, gently placing them on the strings.

"嗡！"

A barely audible sound of the guqin rang out, causing the white mist to ripple.

Perhaps because he was in a front position, Master Fang heard this guqin sound clearly...

But he found it hard to believe. "This... this guqin sound... no, it can't be here."

Su Nantian naturally didn't know what Master Fang was thinking. According to his set script, he fully immersed himself in the performance.

Ten slender fingers danced on the white guqin strings, producing a continuous stream of fresh and pleasant guqin sounds.

As the melody changed smoothly and gracefully, all the dry ice floating in the air fluctuated continuously.

It was as if these white spirits were dancing with this guqin music, as if all things had spiritual energy and were captivated by this otherworldly music.

Maybe the audience didn't understand guqin, maybe they couldn't tell what kind of score it was. But what did it matter? No one had ever said that guqin could only be played for those who understood it.

How to make the listeners understand was the guqin player's job. As Su Nantian's guqin sound gradually rose, everyone was carried into a dreamlike and illusory paradise!

High mountains and flowing water, a small boat. On this boat was an middle-aged man, cooking wine and playing the guqin—unparalleled elegance.

Ordinary audience members were all immersed in it, but Master Fang's only feeling was shock.

"Is this... the legendary...

'Guangling Scattering'? But 'Guangling Scattering' has been lost for thousands of years, hasn't it?"

Even if he considered himself knowledgeable in guqin, he was now confused.

Time didn't know how long had passed. Su Nantian's guqin sound gradually faded away. At the same time, the dry ice smoke on stage also disappeared.

Su Nantian revealed his figure while still sitting in mid-air, holding a white guqin made of dry ice gas.

If there was no dry ice smoke to cover it, this moment would have been clear. Now that the mist had disappeared, the audience stared at Su Nantian in mid-air with their mouths wide open, speechless!

"Truly a person of the heavens! Xiao Su, you've truly amazed everyone today!"

Although the scene was slightly out of control, Zhang Gang still needed to take the stage to regain control. However, as he stepped on, he paused and couldn't help but laugh.

As a professional host, he shouldn't have made such a mistake. It was just that Su Nantian's shock had been too great, making him lose composure.

He walked up to Su Nantian's side and asked with a smile: "Sir, you've finished your performance. Why haven't you gotten up yet?"

Su Nantian wiped his lips and answered with a calm but slightly helpless voice: "I can't get up. If I do, it'll be exposed!"

Chapter 97: Perfect Performance

Su Nantian's words made Zhang Gang and the audience all laugh happily, even Master Fang, who was usually serious, smiled.

Because at that moment, the big screen behind him played a video of his back. From the big screen, it was clear that a slanted support stood in the center of the stage, and Su Nantian sat on it.

Looking back at this scene, Su Nantian also smiled. Although he had said not to get up, he still got down from the support and stood beside Zhang Gang.

Seeing Su Nantian get down, Zhang Gang interacted with the audience while also sitting on it to try. He found that although the support's framework was invisible from the audience's perspective, creating a true floating effect wasn't simple.

The scriptwriter said that this entrance method had many things designed by Su Nantian himself. Zhang Gang couldn't help but silently give him a thumbs-up, feeling some admiration.

Su Nantian's support attracted everyone's attention. Even several audience members were called to try it, as it was a live-streaming variety show and recording. It didn't need too much time control. However, whether this part would be included in the final broadcast was uncertain.

"Hello, I'm Su Nantian!"

After everyone's emotions slightly calmed down and the wave passed, Su Nantian finally spoke to introduce himself to the audience.

"Outstanding Youth of the World!"

"Outstanding Youth of the World!"

The crowd echoed with calls. Obviously, these people were all Su Nantian's fans. They weren't new to this title; otherwise, they wouldn't know it.

After "Outstanding Youth of the World," a group of people called him "Immortal." This was unexpected for Su Nantian. Others quickly agreed and followed, causing the entire hall to erupt in waves of "Immortal"!

Su Nantian wouldn't be intimidated by this scene. In fact, he felt a bit of enjoyment inside. If it weren't for the time limit during this program, he wouldn't have let them stop.

In just a short while, he felt countless lines connecting to himself. The other end was the audience and some staff.

As these energy channels formed, Su Nantian could clearly see the spiritual waves of excitement coming from them. This was faith power!

For Su Nantian, although this power wasn't very pure, it was definitely massive and more powerful than the difficult-to-obtain spiritual energy.

Seeing the situation return to control, Zhang Gang smiled and asked Master Fang sitting in the guest seat: "Master Fang, you are a top expert in music and renowned across the region. You've studied guqin for decades.

I wonder, with your professional standards, how much would you rate this performance?"

Master Fang smiled at Su Nantian and then said: "I originally invited South Tian to participate in this program for another reason.

I had heard from my disciple that South Tian existed. I thought he was a piece of good jade, wanting to take him as my disciple. But it turned out he was already a flawless piece of jade, leaving me no chance to take him as my disciple!"

Although Su Nantian didn't know if Master Fang's words were true or not, this statement definitely elevated Su Nantian's status. The audience clapped more enthusiastically.

"South Tian's skills I naturally don't comment on. In my view, it deserves a perfect score. Even I can't achieve this level.

I mainly want to talk about the stage style issues. Today's performance by South Tian, although it had a good effect, had some conflicts with the content.

It was only through the strong core of the program that it was forcibly combined. Otherwise, if a weaker person had done it, the effect wouldn't have been so impressive."
