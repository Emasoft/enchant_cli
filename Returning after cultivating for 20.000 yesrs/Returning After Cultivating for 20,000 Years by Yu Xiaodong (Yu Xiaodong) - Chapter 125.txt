Chapter 623: Undercover Agent

Wang Bo still maintained a semblance of composure, but his fury was on the verge of spilling over. He had never expected to learn this news through Zhang Yuan, who had summoned him personally. It turned out that his trusted subordinates already knew about the matter but deemed it unimportant, choosing not to inform him.

This revelation made Wang Bo shudder involuntarily. How many missteps had this foolish subordinate caused him?

“Come on, have you finished discussing it? Now you finally realize I wasn’t lying, right?” Zhang Yuan was also growing impatient. He had never imagined that Wang Bo remained unaware of the situation.

Yet Zhang Yuan’s inner thoughts carried a sneer toward Wang Bo. His subordinates had never informed him, and Zhang Yuan found it absurd that Wang Bo lacked control over his own subordinates.

Hearing Zhang Yuan’s words, Wang Bo felt a flush of embarrassment, revealing his vulnerability. However, Wang Bo possessed one innate advantage: thick skin. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have dared to shift the blame for leaking information onto Li Zhe in front of him.

“This was my oversight; I never imagined such a major incident would go unnoticed. But now Li Zhe and the Nan Gong Family are colluding—what exactly do they plan? The Nan Gong Family only holds a one-year revenue right over the inland port. Why go to such lengths to alter our power structure here?”

Wang Bo still grasped the situation clearly. He couldn’t fathom why the Nan Gong Family would go to such extremes. Their costs must be immense, right?

After hearing this, Zhang Yuan closed his eyes and nodded, his expression troubled. He too was baffled by the Nan Gong Family’s motives.

“You’re right. I still don’t understand why they’ve invested so much effort to support Li Zhe. But after a year, this will all be the inland port’s affairs. Whoever among us three holds the most power will ultimately have to obey the Wu Family. The inland port won’t become anyone else’s due to these workers. I don’t believe the Nan Gong Family is unaware of this. That’s what makes me so agitated—no idea what they’re after or their true intentions.”

Indeed, this was the very dilemma Wang Bo had voiced. That’s why he hadn’t hesitated to summon Zhang Yuan for discussion. He believed that with two forces combined, they could at least resist the current situation.

After all, it was their own territory being undermined. Combining their strengths to counter the Nan Gong Family and Li Zhe was undeniably the right move.

“Regardless of their motives for undermining us, we can’t let them have their way. Their current offer is quite tempting. If our people truly defect, it would shrink our influence in the inland port and weaken our leverage—leaving us at their mercy.”

Wang Bo reasoned that if they couldn’t resolve the issue now, there was no point in overthinking it. Even if they could comprehend this problem today, it wouldn’t stop the Nan Gong Family and Li Zhe from proceeding. Therefore, addressing the immediate issue was paramount.

“But how do we proceed now? If we match their offer, it would only cause us massive financial losses.”

Zhang Yuan knew that retaining these workers required elevating their salaries and benefits. Emotional appeals were futile; he had spent years in the inland port and understood what these workers truly needed.

Even if Zhang Yuan could raise their wages slightly, it wouldn’t last long. He could offer better treatment for a month but not sustain it for an entire year. Only the Nan Gong Family’s immense resources could allow Li Zhe to make such demands recklessly.

“It’s impossible to compete with them financially—it’s not in our interest. Even if we retain everyone, we’d have to tighten our belts and endure, perhaps even collapse.”

After hearing this, Wang Bo nodded and rubbed his stubbled chin. After a pause, he said: “We must plant an undercover agent there to uncover their true intentions.”

“Undercover agent?” Zhang Yuan asked, puzzled.

“Yes, we must select our trusted subordinates—preferably those rarely seen. They’re recruiting now, right? We’ll send this agent in and learn their plans firsthand. What do you think of this plan?”

Wang Bo’s suggestion was indeed sound, the only viable option. They couldn’t match the Nan Gong Family financially, so sending their own people to investigate was the only choice.

“This plan is feasible, but most of my trusted subordinates are known to the workers. Finding someone they’ve never seen is challenging, but it’s manageable.”

Indeed, those around Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo were recognizable to the workers since they often interacted with them. Thus, sending a known subordinate was out of the question. They needed someone unseen to blend seamlessly into their group.

“If that’s the case, we should return and find such a person first. Once selected, they can infiltrate those defecting workers unnoticed. By the time they reach Li Zhe’s side, we’ll know their true intentions. Otherwise, luring so many people without action would be a costly mistake. Then all our questions will be answered, and we’ll know how to respond in the future.”

Wang Bo spoke with confidence. Since Li Zhe was recruiting, it was inevitable they wouldn’t check every individual—otherwise, these workers wouldn’t have returned to spread the news. They were after numbers, not loyal subordinates.

Chapter 624: A Meeting

After Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo met and discussed, they both decided to seek out undercover agents.

However, after returning, Wang Bo didn’t immediately start the operation. Instead, he wanted to meet Su Nantian.

He couldn’t fathom why the initial collaboration with the Nan Gong Family had been with him, yet now Su Nantian was working with Li Zhe.

“Don’t mess up this time. Find a suitable person to go undercover. I need to visit the Nan Gong Family and keep your mouths shut.” Wang Bo frowned, addressing his subordinate.

His subordinate nodded immediately. This time, he wouldn’t fail. Earlier, although Wang Bo hadn’t lashed out in front of Zhang Yuan, his demeanor had been terrifying. Moreover, leaving Wang Bo wouldn’t benefit him—his salary as a trusted subordinate was better than defecting. Thus, he would continue to serve Wang Bo diligently.

After instructing his subordinate, Wang Bo immediately pulled out his phone. He had already saved Su Nantian’s number. This time, he sent a direct message to arrange a meeting that night.

At this moment, Su Nantian was idly sitting with Nan Gong Fei in the office. There was no work today at the inland port, so they were just passing time.

Moreover, Su Nantian’s plan was progressing smoothly, and he didn’t need to do anything now. Thus, he appeared quite idle, merely waiting for the final phase.

Suddenly, Su Nantian’s phone rang—it was a message from Wang Bo. Upon opening it, he couldn’t help but smile.

“Smiling about what? Who sent you a message? Or is it a pretty girl inviting you out? You’ve got quite the luck with women,” Nan Gong Fei noticed Su Nantian’s smile and said.

“Don’t be ridiculous. Who would a girl invite me? I’m just a bodyguard, after all.” Su Nantian waved his hand and replied.

“You’re smiling at your phone, so I thought it was a girl inviting you out.” Nan Gong Fei said this while peeking over Su Nantian’s shoulder.

“You’re imagining things. It’s Wang Bo,” Su Nantian said, typing on his screen to inform Wang Bo of the meeting’s location and time.

“Wang Bo? Why did Wang Bo invite you?” Nan Gong Fei was confused. Though he knew about Su Nantian’s plan with Nan Gong Yuyan, his mind couldn’t connect the dots. To him, Wang Bo was an opponent; it was strange for him to send a message inviting Su Nantian.

“Wang Bo invited me tonight. They must have learned about our recruitment of workers for Li Zhe. He probably thinks why this opportunity fell to Li Zhe instead of him.”

Su Nantian had thoroughly understood Wang Bo’s mindset, and he had even predicted Wang Bo would approach him.

“Then what are you going to do? Try to recruit Wang Bo?”

Hearing this, Su Nantian shook his head. “This time, we only need Li Zhe’s cooperation. We don’t need Wang Bo involved. It’s better if fewer people are involved, but within limits.”

After hearing this, Nan Gong Fei didn’t press further. This was beyond his comprehension, so he didn’t insist.

Soon, it was time for Su Nantian and Wang Bo’s meeting at the hotel they had previously arranged. Su Nantian didn’t hide anything, as he never intended to keep it secret from everyone.

As time ticked by, Su Nantian sat in the private room waiting. Soon, a knock echoed at the door.

“Come in.” Su Nantian said, and the door opened.

A server led Wang Bo into the room, then closed the door and left.

Wang Bo arrived with sincerity; he knew he couldn’t bring his subordinates or staff for this meeting, so he came alone.

Su Nantian gestured to the seat in front of him, inviting Wang Bo to sit.

“What’s up? Why did you suddenly want to meet?” Su Nantian didn’t say much at first. Though he knew why Wang Bo had come, he wouldn’t be the one to bring it up.

Although Su Nantian didn’t plan to hide, he wanted to create an atmosphere where the matter seemed unspoken. Only then would Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo feel they had uncovered a secret.

Wang Bo smiled broadly and said, “Why did I come to see you? You don’t know?” The news had already spread secretly throughout the inland port, and they, as local bosses, certainly knew.

But after Wang Bo said this, Su Nantian remained unmoved, as if he didn’t understand what he meant.

Wang Bo sighed and said, “Ah, I’ll stop beating around the bush. Tell me what’s going on? Why are you helping Li Zhe to recruit soldiers behind our backs?”

“Ah, that’s what you mean. It’s nothing special. Li Zhe offered me some good terms, and I thought it was more profitable to help him. So we cooperated.” Su Nantian waved his hand, appearing indifferent.

Wang Bo almost rolled his eyes upon hearing this. He knew exactly what Li Zhe had offered him, and he didn’t believe Li Zhe could repay the Nan Gong Family with equal value.

“You’re just giving money away to Li Zhe, letting him expand his forces and steal all our men. Tell me how we survivors can get by?” Wang Bo continued smiling but didn’t say his true feelings.

“You people at the dock don’t have much loyalty. Whoever offers more money, you follow them. Now that we’re offering more, they’ll come over. If you can’t make it, you can also become workers here. It’s a simple matter, nothing complicated.”

Su Nantian said this intentionally to provoke Wang Bo.

Chapter 625: Regret

Upon hearing Su Nantian’s words, Wang Bo truly panicked and stood up immediately. “Actually, I’m not particularly opposed to you recruiting workers with high pay. I know this society values profit, and workers naturally go where the待遇 is better.”

Upon hearing Wang Bo’s words, Su Nantian secretly smiled. He understood that Wang Bo was first softening his stance before discussing interests.

“But I’m still confused why you helped Li Zhe. Didn’t we collaborate first? And my forces are larger than his. If we recruited workers, it would be faster. Many people might hesitate to cross over due to the current situation at the dock, but if we support me instead, it would be much better.”

Wang Bo finally couldn’t hold back and voiced his inner thoughts. He had come to Su Nantian to intercept them, believing he had much better conditions than Li Zhe. Plus, they had previously collaborated, so he thought the Nan Gong Family would be safer to partner with him.

Upon hearing Wang Bo’s true words, Su Nantian smiled.

“You’re right; we did collaborate first. But this matter wasn’t suitable. The data leak incident has already labeled Li Zhe as a traitor, so my cooperation with him is legitimate and justified. If I had approached you instead, Zhang Yuan would have inevitably joined Li Zhe, creating a strong alliance that wasn’t good for me. That’s why I chose Li Zhe and saw if he was willing to cooperate. Fortunately, he was wise enough to agree quickly.”

Actually, Su Nantian’s considerations went beyond this. More importantly, he still held the leverage from their previous collaboration with Wang Bo, so defeating Wang Bo and Zhang Yuan’s alliance was quite easy. Once he released the evidence, Zhang Yuan would have to cooperate with Wang Bo despite inner resentment.

Moreover, at this moment, the inland port’s three local bosses: Wang Bo had previously collaborated with the Nan Gong Family, Li Zhe was currently collaborating with them, leaving Zhang Yuan isolated. This alone would surely create resentment between the two men in his heart.

Even if Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo later joined forces, they could be easily defeated.

After Su Nantian said this much, how could Wang Bo not understand? He wasn’t a fool. His ability to maintain his position in the inland port and still harbor ambitions proved he was shrewd.

“You’re trying to threaten me with my leverage, right? Even if we both join forces, as long as this thing is in Zhang Yuan’s heart, he won’t fully cooperate with me. Plus, I don’t have a good opinion of Zhang Yuan anyway; I’ve always wanted to bring him down. So you’re using my psychology. Even if I now understand your intentions, I still can’t get over this inner barrier and worry about Zhang Yuan discovering the past. Am I right?”

Wang Bo’s face turned cold as he said this, no longer smiling at Su Nantian. He knew his chance to collaborate with the Nan Gong Family was completely blown, so even if he tried to please them now, it would be useless. His fate was waiting for his workers to be stolen.

However, at this moment, Su Nantian stood up and smiled, patting Wang Bo’s shoulder. “You don’t need to worry too much. Although we’ve offered conditions to secretly recruit these inland port workers, we won’t empty everyone. Of course, you shouldn’t misunderstand; the Nan Gong Family indeed has this strength, but I also know that doing things should leave a margin. This way, you and Zhang Yuan can still survive.”

Of course, Su Nantian didn’t mention the issue of those private goods, but he did reveal his intentions. He knew Wang Bo was a smart man; after hearing that he wouldn’t exterminate them, he would surely realize.

Thus, Su Nantian met Wang Bo today to dispel his previous thoughts. He also clearly told Wang Bo he wouldn’t exterminate them, giving him a sense of security. That is to say, even if the days ahead were harder than before, Wang Bo and his group could still survive in this inland port.

“If that’s the case, I won’t bother you further. Just hope your plan will be merciful when implemented. I, Wang Bo, am willing to cooperate with the Nan Gong Family anytime.”

Wang Bo was also shrewd. Before leaving, he said this to show his goodwill toward the Nan Gong Family.

However, Wang Bo had already regretted it. He had wanted to collaborate with the Nan Gong Family before, but due to the one-year term issue, he hadn’t decided yet and missed his chance.

But now it seemed even if he wanted to collaborate with the Nan Gong Family, they might not choose him this time.

Thus, Wang Bo left helplessly. But today’s statement made Su Nantian know that if anything happened later, he still had this backup plan in the inland port.

Moreover, Zhang Yuan’s forces were the largest and clearly unwilling to submit. Thus, in the end, if they had to crush Zhang Yuan, it would probably require uniting Li Zhe and Wang Bo.

But these were future matters. At least, Su Nantian now had control over most of the inland port’s forces. Not only were they currently recruiting workers, but Wang Bo also agreed to cooperate later, which was naturally a good thing.

Chapter 626: Dividing the Profits

Su Nantian’s previous strategy was highly effective. After recruiting thirty workers, he didn’t immediately send them to Li Zhe but let them return to recruit more people.

This method had made most of the inland port’s workers aware of this news, and many were eager to join since the money was so tempting.

At this moment, only a few days remained until the private cargo arrived. If Su Nantian and his group could ensure these workers could immediately fight for their side, they would succeed that day.

Moreover, they weren’t doing this solely for the profit of this batch of private cargo. If successful, the Nan Gong Family would have a comfortable year in the inland port.

“It’s time to reel them in,” Su Nantian observed, noting that today was the day this batch of cargo arrived at the inland port dock and that the expected arrival time was early in the morning.

Su Nantian directly sent a message to Li Zhe, instructing his subordinates to gather all the workers who had agreed to join him. They would arrive three hours early at the inland port.

Moreover, Su Nantian personally brought a money box this time. It was filled with cash. He wasn’t doing this for any other reason but to publicly distribute the rewards to those who had recruited people, showing these workers that joining Li Zhe’s side truly offered this much money.

After everything was prepared, Su Nantian arrived at the inland port dock. The square should have been dark, but now it was illuminated with lights and bustling with people.

Because those who had agreed to join Li Zhe’s side had arrived here, but Su Nantian had specifically mentioned that the number of recruits was limited. With over a thousand workers in the inland port, Su Nantian only needed four hundred more, plus Li Zhe’s existing two hundred and something, totaling around seven hundred. This number had completely outmatched Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo’s forces.

Meanwhile, the Nan Gong Family also sent one hundred armed guards. This group alone could match many workers’ combat power.

However, among these newly recruited workers were also undercover agents sent by Zhang Yuan. After Wang Bo met with Su Nantian, he had decided not to send any undercover agents this time because even if he did, it wouldn’t benefit him fully. Moreover, it would offend Su Nantian, and why do such a thing?

When Su Nantian arrived at the square, Li Zhe was already there. He immediately exchanged a few words with Li Zhe before Li Zhe waved to the crowd, signaling them to be quiet.

Seeing Su Nantian’s many guards and Li Zhe’s actions, these workers immediately stopped their discussions.

“I think everyone already knows me. We’ve all worked together in the inland port, so I won’t introduce myself. Today, I’ve gathered you to officially join my forces. Perhaps some of you wonder why we chose this time, but it’s because we have a job at dawn. I believe everyone knows about it.

But before this work, the Nan Gong Family’s boss will distribute money to you. After receiving the money, we’ll go to work happily. What do you say?”

“Good!” Upon hearing about the money, these workers were all energetic. After all, they had joined Li Zhe’s side for the extra salary. If it weren’t for those additional five hundred dollars, they wouldn’t have defected to Li Zhe.

“I mentioned before that thirty workers would return to spread this message and recruit more people. Each person recruited earns ten dollars. Today is the day to pay them. Perhaps some are eager and wonder why we promised an extra five hundred dollars per month, but this is paid together with the salary. Now, we’re paying an additional amount.

So now, please have these thirty workers bring the people they recruited here to me. I’ll distribute the money in front of everyone.”

After Su Nantian said this, he immediately opened his money box on the table. Inside were red bills.

Moreover, Su Nantian had many boxes managed by Nan Gong Family guards—this was the money he had previously requested from Nan Gong Lin. Naturally, this profit would be deducted from Li Zhe’s side after this private cargo operation.

Upon hearing Su Nantian say this, the thirty workers who had entered the hotel immediately led their agreed-upon colleagues to come forward. Upon seeing them approach, Su Nantian couldn’t help but be amazed at the number of people.

One person had recruited as many as sixty, which was quite a large scale.

Su Nantian immediately started counting the people they had recruited, and one person had even recruited sixty. This left Su Nantian speechless; it was clear that for money, anything was possible.

Su Nantian distributed the money to them one by one. Although the maximum anyone received was six hundred dollars, it was enough to make other workers envious.

However, after distributing this part, Su Nantian didn’t stop but continued to distribute the money in the same manner, asking those recruited by these people to bring their subordinates as well.

After distributing the money to over four hundred people, it only cost Su Nantian more than four thousand dollars. However, the effect was very good; every worker present was satisfied. At least, they had seen money in their pockets on the first day, which made them more confident that joining Li Zhe’s side would indeed provide extra monthly salaries.

“Alright, the money has been distributed. Now I’ll tell you what everyone needs to do next. A batch of cargo will soon arrive at the inland port, but simultaneously, a batch of smuggled goods is mixed in. Originally, this profit was to be distributed among all the workers at the inland port. However, now we’ll take all these goods for ourselves—meaning this money will only be divided among our people. Do you understand?”

Su Nantian openly revealed his plan, but after he said this, the workers showed no reaction.

However, Li Zhe, standing nearby, told the crowd: “We can ensure that this cargo is only divided among our people. Everyone will get an additional two hundred dollars!”

“Understood!” The workers shouted back.

Chapter 627: Uncovering the Undercover Agent

It was no surprise that money could move mountains. These workers had initially shown no response, but once Li Zhe mentioned they would get more money than before, their enthusiasm skyrocketed.

However, at this moment, Su Nantian noticed someone trying to sneak out of the crowd and immediately tapped his two Nan Gong Family guards, signaling them to catch this person.

The Nan Gong Family guards moved swiftly. As soon as Su Nantian tapped them, they understood his intention and rushed toward the direction he pointed.

The Nan Gong Family guards were indeed fast, moving like lightning. Before anyone could react, they tackled the person trying to escape and carried him toward Su Nantian.

Su Nantian didn’t hide the fact that he had these guards bring this person to him and smiled at him, saying: “Why do you want to run now? To inform them?”

In fact, Su Nantian had already noticed this person. He knew he was an undercover agent from Zhang Yuan. After Wang Bo met with him, he had completely abandoned the idea of sending an undercover agent this time. Thus, he only focused on Zhang Yuan’s people.

Upon hearing Su Nantian’s words, the person was also shocked because he couldn’t imagine his identity had been exposed so easily. He rarely interacted with Zhang Yuan and only worked under him occasionally, secretly reporting to Zhang Yuan about the workers’ activities.

Moreover, he had never publicly revealed his identity as Zhang Yuan’s subordinate. Because of this, Zhang Yuan had chosen him to be an undercover agent here to avoid suspicion. However, he didn’t know why Su Nantian had so precisely caught him.

“Go back and tell Zhang Yuan to relay everything I said. Even if he and Wang Bo bring their people, they won’t get what they want because numbers are our greatest advantage.”

After saying this, Su Nantian signaled the two guards to let him go. The person saw his identity was exposed and didn’t argue, knowing Su Nantian had already discovered something. He quickly left the scene to contact Zhang Yuan about what had happened.

In fact, Su Nantian intentionally let the Nan Gong Family guards bring this person forward to say these words. This was to intimidate the other workers, making them realize he had complete control over them and wouldn’t allow any small tricks.

Moreover, Su Nantian wasn’t afraid of Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo now. If they brought their workers here, it would only be crushed by the numbers.

“Alright, I’ve already told everyone why I gathered you here today. The ship’s cargo is expected to arrive at the inland port in less than half an hour. You can rest for a while now and prepare to work.”

After Su Nantian said this, Li Zhe signaled the workers to relax. He and Su Nantian sat on nearby benches waiting for the cargo’s arrival.

“Nothing unexpected, I hope?” Li Zhe thought, still somewhat worried. After all, he had always been the smallest force in the inland port. Now achieving this position made him feel unreal.

“What are you afraid of? I’m here to protect you, right? The Nan Gong Family guards are still standing here. They came to escort and protect you. If this plan succeeds, you’ll be the one in charge of the inland port. But I also have to say something harsh: I can elevate you to this position and also kick you down. So don’t forget the agreement with the Nan Gong Family. You know what to do within this year.”

Su Nantian spoke without hesitation in front of Li Zhe. He knew these words were harsh, but he didn’t fear any resistance from Li Zhe. After all, Su Nantian could truly do what he said—elevate Li Zhe with one hand and kick him down with another.

Li Zhe felt uncomfortable upon hearing this, but he knew he couldn’t oppose Su Nantian. Because what Su Nantian said was indeed true.

Especially during this period, Li Zhe had been fully involved in the current matter. Thus, she also knew that Su Nantian could easily change the inland port’s power structure in just a few days. If she rebelled, he could easily choose another person to replace her.

“You can rest easy. I won’t forget. My rise from the smallest force in the inland port to this position is thanks to you and the Nan Gong Family. Thus, we’ll cooperate well in the coming years. I will also consolidate my position firmly so that when the Nan Gong Family leaves, they won’t push me down.”

Li Zhe’s words were sincere, showing his loyalty to Su Nantian.

However, while they waited, the undercover agent who had been released arrived at Zhang Yuan’s place.

Zhang Yuan also knew that the cargo would arrive in the middle of the night, so he was preparing to lead his men to the inland port. But unexpectedly, this undercover agent returned in a hurry and looked quite disheveled.

“What’s going on? Why did you return now? If I’m not mistaken, today there is cargo coming. You shouldn’t be going with them to retrieve it?” Zhang Yuan asked suspiciously, noticing the man’s appearance seemed to have something wrong.

“Sir, it’s bad news. They’ve gathered people together just to monopolize this cargo. Originally, we shared the profits based on our forces, but now they want to take all the money from this private cargo for themselves and not share it with us.”

“What? That’s rebelling against heaven! Who dares to tamper with the inland port’s rules? Did they discover your identity as an undercover agent?” Zhang Yuan was shocked and asked whether his undercover agent’s identity had been exposed.

The man could only nod shamefully and said, “I was about to return to inform you but got caught immediately. It seems they knew I was an undercover agent from the beginning and were very arrogant, letting me return to inform you without fear.”

Chapter 628: Gathering Forces

Upon hearing the undercover agent’s words, Zhang Yuan continued to ask: “Did they catch anyone else besides you?”

“No, just me. I was trying to sneak back to inform you but got caught. And I think they knew I was an undercover agent from the beginning. They just waited for me to leave and sent someone to catch me.” The undercover agent’s mind was still clear, knowing he wasn’t caught on the spot but likely had been watched all along.

“I see. Go and prepare, then we’ll go together. We can’t let them monopolize the money. Otherwise, the inland port’s rules will be ruined.” Zhang Yuan said while frowning, knowing this battle wouldn’t be easy.

“But sir, they have more people and strength. If we go there with our group…” The man also expressed concern, as he had seen the number of people in the inland port. He knew that Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo’s combined forces were still fewer than Li Zhe’s, so even if they all went there, they wouldn’t be able to match them.

“We can’t just sit and do nothing. Besides, these workers have been with me for a while. I don’t believe they’ll let us die without helping. Moreover, if the rules break now, it will be even more chaotic after the Nan Gong Family leaves. Now they’re suppressing Li Zhe, but when the Nan Gong Family leaves, who knows what will happen to the inland port.”

Zhang Yuan knew he couldn’t sit idle or give up resistance because of today’s numerical disadvantage. If he gave up, he would be at a loss for the entire year.

After speaking, Zhang Yuan waved his hand to let the man go prepare, and he immediately called Wang Bo. Now only by uniting their forces could they have a chance to resist Li Zhe’s people.
