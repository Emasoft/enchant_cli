After a brief pause, Su Nantian made no move with his hands and delivered a kick. The speed was so fast it produced a sound of breaking through the air. It struck directly between Gao Qiguang's legs, who was halfway undressed. "Ah!" Gao Qiguang let out a scream of unbearable agony, his body instantly contorting like a shrimp. In addition to the excruciating pain, he clearly felt liquid flowing down his thighs. Under the dim light, he saw it was blood. He knew his future was over. Overwhelmed by fear and pain, Gao Qiguang fainted. Su Nantian didn't even glance at him before approaching the Rolls-Royce to check on Lin Suyun and Yao Lina. Both women were fully dressed, showing no signs of indecency. Su Nantian felt relieved and opened the trunk. He then walked back to Gao Qiguang, disdainfully tossing his bloodied lower body into the trunk. Su Nantian whistled as he drove Gao Qiguang's Rolls-Royce Phantom toward the Gao family estate. "This car really feels powerful!" Even a celestial being from another world praised this earthly luxury vehicle. With no people or cars nearby and lacking a driver's license, Su Nantian enjoyed the thrill of driving. Earlier, he had used his cultivation to search at the speed of a thousand-li for Yao Lina's mentioned forest, then been drawn by Gao Qiguang's unturned headlights. In a way, Gao Qiguang's pursuit of women was both his success and downfall. Within the Gao family estate, Gao Qingyun received a call from Gao Qiangyun at midnight and rushed over. Gao Qiangyun was Gao Qingyun's paternal uncle, meeting only once a year at the family business annual meeting. Even then, they maintained an upper-lower relationship, with no familial warmth. Gao Qiangyun was merely a background figure at family gatherings. This wasn't due to Grandfather Gao's coldness but because the Gao family was a towering mansion with thriving descendants. As head of the clan, Gao Qingyun had many responsibilities. In recent years, family resources had increasingly focused on cultivation. For those without cultivation potential, it wasn't that they didn't care but couldn't manage. However, the Gao family was relatively humane, offering worldly descendants top-tier material treatment. This was evident from Gao Qiguang's possession of a Rolls-Royce Phantom. Gao Qingyun said little on the phone, only mentioning an urgent matter requiring Gao Qiangyun's immediate arrival. Gao Qiangyun hoped this midnight summons might be good news, perhaps a promotion. But upon arriving at the estate, he was scolded harshly by Gao Qingyun, leaving him stunned. Learning that his son had attempted indecency against Su Nantian's friend, he turned ashen. Worse than being scolded by Grandfather Gao, since he had experienced Su Nantian's methods before. While Gao Qiangyun was in a daze, Su Nantian returned by car. At that moment, the Gao family had gathered in the living room, with servants assisting the unconscious Lin Suyun and Yao Lina into the house. After a while, Su Nantian entered alone, seeing Gao Qiangyun slumped on the sofa. "Master Gao, I made your nephew bleed a little and got it messy, so I didn't bring him in. No problem, right?" "No problem at all," Gao Qingyun replied hurriedly. Originally, Gao Qingyun thought Su Nantian might have killed Gao Qiguang. Calling Gao Qiangyun was to retrieve the body. Now, hearing Su Nantian's words implied he hadn't killed Gao Qiguang—this was already a blessing. It could be said Su Nantian had given Gao Qingyun great face. Although Gao Qiguang was a beast, he was still part of the family. Su Nantian not killing him was already generous to Gao Qingyun's face. A lifeless Gao Qiangyun, hearing his son was alive, fell to his knees before Su Nantian. "Master Su, you're magnanimous. Please spare my son! Whatever punishment you choose, just let him live!" Gao Qiangyun, disregarding all dignity, begged desperately before Su Nantian, who looked younger than his son. "This time I'll spare him, but I don't want to see him in Fengcheng again. Next time I meet him, hmpf!" If not for the previous incident, Gao Qiguang wouldn't have just lost half his life. Gao Qiangyun understood Su Nantian's meaning, heart aching. But there was nothing he could do—this was the best outcome. His son had done so much evil, and now angering Su Nantian was the end of his misdeeds. "By the way, Mr. Gao, your son's car is good. I'll take it as compensation for my girlfriend and her best friend's mental trauma. Okay?" Su Nantian had planned to take the car on his way back, then ask Zhang Xue to get him a license. He had helped her so much; having her obtain a license for him wasn't really embezzling. "Of course, of course. Take the car as you like," Gao Qiangyun now complied with everything Su Nantian asked. "Take him away." Su Nantian returned to the house, telling Gao Qingyun that Gao Qiangyun had already driven his son to the hospital. Even a master physician couldn't save him. Gao Qingyun's heart had been in his throat all night, now finally at ease. He didn't care about Gao Qiguang's fate or even Gao Qiangyun. But the night had passed without the Gao family's relationship with Su Nantian being ruined by a rotten fish. At this point, Lin Suyun and Yao Lina gradually woke from the drug's effects. Knowing the Gao family would be curious about Lin Suyun's identity, Su Nantian introduced her. He took Lin Suyun's hand on the sofa and introduced to the Gao family: "This is my girlfriend, Lin Suyun from the Lin family." Chapter 70: Women's Thoughts Hearing "Lin family," Gao Qingyun was stunned. He smiled kindly and said to Lin Suyun, "Child, I've known your grandfather for a long time. But I never knew he had such a beautiful granddaughter." Lin Suyun had heard of Gao Qingyun's reputation before. Now seeing the elderly man, she found him kind and approachable, without arrogance. She felt a deep connection, reminiscent of her grandfather. "Thank you for the compliment, Grandpa Gao. My grandfather often mentioned you and respects you greatly." Lin Suyun replied politely. At this moment, the impetuous Gao Yi rushed downstairs from upstairs, shouting as he ran: "Suzhong, Suzhong! I heard you beat up that pervert Gao Qiguang. Tell me the details, that guy really deserved it! I've wanted to take him down for a long time!" Seeing Gao Yi's madness, both Gao Qingyun and Su Nantian were exasperated. The boy had been playing games in his room with headphones on, unaware of what happened outside. Now knowing the truth, he came to bother them. "You useless kid, no real business is ever missing from you. Go back to your room and don't bother Suzhong's friends!" Gao Qingyun, who loved his grandson, scolded him with a smile. Gao Yi was excited to come down but was scolded by his grandfather, so he reluctantly went back upstairs. However, he saw Su Nantian holding Lin Suyun's hand and called her "big sister" repeatedly, making Lin Suyun blush. Su Nantian almost wanted to teach Gao Qingyun a lesson for this. After an eventful night with no real danger, Gao Qingyun as the host said to Lin Suyun and Su Nantian: "It's late now. We apologize for frightening you, Lin Miss and Yao Miss. How about staying here tonight to calm down? We can have breakfast together tomorrow and leave." Lin Suyun looked at Su Nantian, seeking his opinion. Su Nantian thought Lin Suyun must be tired and that his cultivation research had been interrupted. Staying at the Gao family would let Lin Suyun and Yao Lina rest early and also help him study his cultivation. So he accepted Gao Qingyun's invitation. Yao Lina naturally followed Lin Suyun. The group stayed at the Gao family, with the most excited being Gao Jingjing, who joyfully helped her grandfather arrange their accommodations. In this little girl's heart, Su Nantian was a godlike figure. He had first relieved her long-standing illness that others couldn't solve. Then discovered her extraordinary cultivation potential. Next, he set up a talisman for the Gao family to release spiritual energy. Tonight, he even showed mercy to that beast Gao Qiguang. Most importantly, he was so handsome! The girl's heart had secretly developed feelings for Su Nantian. If Su Nantian knew he was only being kind to Gao Qingyun's face by not killing Gao Qiguang, he would have boasted about his wisdom! Yao Lina and the young Taoist were each assigned rooms. Su Nantian led Lin Suyun to the room previously arranged for him. As soon as they entered, Lin Suyun tightly hugged Su Nantian and started crying. "You didn't come home at night and didn't call me. I called you, but it was Gao Jingjing who answered. I didn't know what was happening here, so I came with Lina to find you. Who knew there was a pervert? It's all your fault, big bad guy! I was so scared!" Lin Suyun scolded Su Nantian while punching his chest with small fists. Actually, it wasn't that Su Nantian forgot to call; he just never had the habit. Previously in the outer world's fairy realm, Su Nantian usually spent his time cultivating and studying techniques. Now with a woman by his side, these little couple's tricks had just started to take effect. Su Nantian wrapped his arms around Lin Suyun and said tenderly, "Alright, my wife. I'll be more careful from now on and not make you worry anymore." "Who's your wife!" Lin Suyun was delighted but still blushed and refused. "I just publicly announced you as my girlfriend. Now you're undermining me, how cruel!" Su Nantian pretended to be hurt. Saying "publicly announced," Lin Suyun was still in sweet dreams, this being Su Nantian's first public acknowledgment of her as his girlfriend. But Lin Suyun was still shy, unsure what to say. However, her next action spoke volumes. Lin Suyun stood on tiptoe and kissed Su Nantian's lips lightly. Su Nantian was then embarrassed, his lower body responding with renewed vigor. Lin Suyun clearly felt Su Nantian's change but was used to his lack of self-control. She twisted the soft flesh on Su Nantian's waist, and he even pretended to cry out in pain. Though this force was like tickling for him. After a while of teasing, the two lovers were together in the room. Meanwhile, someone else couldn't sleep. Yao Lina recalled when Su Nantian had taken Lin Suyun's hand and publicly announced she was his girlfriend in the Gao family living room. Indeed, it was her best friend's boyfriend, but Yao Lina couldn't deny she was jealous. "What are you thinking about, Yao Lina!" Yao Lina was usually bold but had a delicate heart. Due to her beauty and righteousness, she never lacked admirers, yet she had fallen for her best friend's boyfriend. Before Lin Suyun and Su Nantian confirmed their relationship, Yao Lina could joke or avoid her feelings. But everything changed after Su Nantian's public announcement. Another sleepless person was Gao Jingjing. Born into the Gao family, she had always lived in comfort with her father and grandfather protecting her. Though many flirtatious men surrounded her, they dared not act due to her family status. Thus, besides her brother, Gao Jingjing had never interacted much with young men. Plus, she had long suffered from a cold-constitution illness, leaving no energy to focus on her romantic needs. Su Nantian's appearance was like a stone thrown into calm water, suddenly and unobtrusively entering Gao Jingjing's life and heart. Pure and innocent, she envied Su Nantian and Lin Suyun's perfect match. Yet a vague sense of loss she couldn't understand lingered in her heart. Lying in bed, Gao Jingjing thought more and more confusedly, forcing herself not to think. Suddenly recalling Su Nantian would soon accompany her to school, she felt excitement again. Her confused emotions vanished instantly. Chapter 71: Leaving the Gao Family The next morning at the Gao family, Gao Qingyun got up early and had the housekeeper and servants prepare a lavish breakfast. With more people eating than usual, the Gao family was unusually lively that morning. During the meal, Lin Suyun received a call. It was her family informing her that the house in Fengyue Community was ready, and she could move in anytime. After Lin Suyun told Su Nantian this, Gao Qingyun decided to have Gao Jingjing accompany Su Nantian after breakfast. Before finishing the meal, he ordered servants to help Gao Jingjing pack her belongings. Gao Qingyun's proactive behavior surprised Su Nantian a bit. Lin Suyun, naturally innocent, didn't think much, assuming it was Grandpa's action-oriented nature. Only Yao Lina noticed something, and her guess proved correct. Gao Qingyun's haste to send his granddaughter with Su Nantian was influenced by Su Nantian's "public announcement" the previous night. Before Lin Suyun appeared, Gao Qingyun had already intended to match Su Nantian with his granddaughter Gao Jingjing in the future. This was why he had actively facilitated Su Nantian and Gao Jingjing's cohabitation and school attendance. If they could bind Su Nantian, an outstanding young talent, as their son-in-law, it would greatly benefit the Gao family. Naturally, Gao Qingyun wasn't someone who only cared about family interests and ignored his granddaughter's feelings. Experienced as he was, he could see Gao Jingjing had already fallen for Su Nantian. Thus, his original plan was two-fold. However, Lin Suyun's sudden appearance disrupted his plans. Fortunately, the Lin and Gao families had always been friendly, so there was no conflict of interest. But this didn't stop Gao Qingyun from continuing to push his granddaughter toward Su Nantian. In large families, matters of love are far more open than in the secular world. Whether cultivators or not, everything is about strength. However, if one strictly adheres to monogamy like the secular world, genetic combinations are limited. Sometimes, with reproductive issues, it's easy for generations to dwindle. Based on this, the best approach is actively absorbing good genes while ensuring quality and bloodline coexist. Thus, if Su Nantian was willing, Gao Qingyun wouldn't mind Gao Jingjing sharing Su Nantian with other women. Of course, this was Gao Qingyun's current thought; how it would turn out depended on the young people themselves. Seeing Gao Qingyun's servants packing for Gao Jingjing, Lin Suyun quickly said to Gao Qingyun: "Grandpa Gao, no need for trouble. We've already prepared everything for Jingjing. She just needs to bring a few clothes and personal items." "Haha, thank you, Miss Lin," Gao Qingyun smiled kindly to express gratitude. Lin Suyun's behavior made Gao Qingyun feel more at ease, as it seemed she didn't oppose Gao Jingjing. Actually, Lin Suyun's generous behavior was due to Su Nantian's various cruel oaths the previous night. Things like "If I harm a girl, may I be struck by lightning" weren't even worth mentioning. Su Nantian had even cursed himself to lack a certain organ if he broke his promise, prompting Lin Suyun to punch him again. All oaths were sworn, and Su Nantian mourned his future sons for three minutes. After breakfast, Su Nantian took Lin Suyun, Yao Lina, and Gao Jingjing. He drove the Rolls-Royce Phantom sponsored by Gao Shengyun, leaving in style. He also asked the Gao family to take care of the young Taoist and secretly gave him a cultivation manual, explaining some precautions. Su Nantian first dropped off Yao Lina and then headed directly to Fengyue Community. Along the way, the Rolls-Royce Phantom attracted many envious glances. At a red light, Su Nantian noticed a Porsche 911 behind him constantly flashing its lights. Huang Dudu, with his golden chicken-crest hairstyle, was driving his flashy Porsche 911 to meet a friend. Huang Dudu's name fit him perfectly; relying on his father being the president of He Lin Pharmaceutical, he had billions in assets and was involved in gambling, drugs—nothing he didn't touch. Last night, his friend Gao Qiguang had posted a photo of two beauties in their shared He Lin Thirteen Nobles group chat, claiming he had caught a good catch and had arranged to share "victories" at the He Lin Wanhao Grand Hotel. The term "He Lin Thirteen Nobles" referred to a group of decadent young men in He Lin City. The one Su Nantian had kneed was a core member of this group, benefiting from the Gao family. Gao Qiguang had disgraced the Gao family both at home and abroad. During the red light, Huang Dudu checked his phone again, seeing Gao Qiguang's photo of the two beauties. "Damn it, Gao Qiguang really got lucky! I'll start registering as a Didi driver." Huang Dudu greedily looked at the photo of Lin Suyun and Yao Lina, fantasizing about seducing beauties at night. After putting his phone down, he looked up and saw a Rolls-Royce Phantom. These rich young men often played with cars, so they were curious about the owner of a top-tier luxury car. Huang Dudu initially didn't notice, but upon closer inspection of the license plate: "Oh my god, isn't this Old Gao's car!" "When did this kid get ahead of me?" Huang Dudu was puzzled. Then he flashed his lights at the Rolls-Royce Phantom to greet Gao Qiguang. Su Nantian, disturbed by the flashing lights, thought this person was crazy, flashing his lights in broad daylight. He rolled down the window and shouted out: "Idiot, stop flashing! What's wrong with you!" Realizing there were two ladies in the car, Su Nantian felt embarrassed for cursing. Lin Suyun wasn't bothered, but Gao Jingjing hadn't become that close yet; seeing her so vulgar made her feel it ruined her image. Seeing the person sticking his head out wasn't Gao Qiguang, Huang Dudu was stunned: "I didn't know Old Gao hired a driver!" Chapter 72: I, the Beijing Thirteen Nobles This was a busy intersection with a long red light. Huang Dudu was stunned but decided to take the time to approach and clarify. "Maybe Old Gao was too exhausted last night and hired a driver?" "That driver is really amazing, not seeing what kind of car I drive." "If it's a nobody with no background, I'll definitely beat him up!" Huang Dudu thought this while opening his car door and approaching Su Nantian's car. After scolding, Su Nantian didn't care and whistled while playing with his phone. "Hey, who are you? Where's Old Gao?" As Su Nantian was about to take out his phone, someone spoke at the car door. He didn't even look up. "I'm Su Nantian. Who's Old Gao?" This would have made Gao Qiguang spit blood! He had just crippled his son and stolen his car. Now he completely forgot about him, Su Nantian truly had a fish's memory! "You don't know Old Gao? Then why are you driving his car?" Huang Dudu was even more confused. Hearing this, Su Nantian finally understood what was happening. He put down his phone and looked at Huang Dudu outside the car. Seeing Huang Dudu's messy hairstyle, Su Nantian mentally cursed "sloppy hairdo," a term he had just learned. "Are you a friend of Gao Qiguang?" Su Nantian still spoke carelessly. "I'm Huang Dudu, part of the He Lin Thirteen Nobles with Old Gao. Who the hell are you? If you don't tell me, I'll beat you up!" Huang Dudu's arrogance surfaced again. "Huang Dudu, Huang gambling and drugs, hahaha." Su Nantian seemed not to hear him, laughing aloud. "Nantian, what's happening?" Lin Suyun hadn't paid attention but noticed the person outside mentioning Gao Qiguang and saying he would beat someone. She leaned forward from the back seat to ask Su Nantian. Huang Dudu heard Su Nantian mocking his name and was angry, about to curse. But seeing Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing in the car, his anger eased half. His lust for women took over. Seeing Lin Suyun's profile, Huang Dudu thought he had seen her somewhere before. "Oh my god, that's the girl in Old Gao's photo!" With Huang Dudu's limited brainpower, he couldn't figure out why a stranger was driving his friend's car. Why the woman who had been with his friend was in this car. And why there was a beautiful girl he hadn't seen before in the car. But he didn't care anymore. Huang Dudu, having developed evil intentions toward the women in the car, said to Su Nantian: "Kid, I think you're a thief who stole the car!" "Tell you the truth, I'm someone with status in He Lin. If you don't want to be arrested by the police called by me." "Now get out of the car and leave! These two beauties will come with me to the Wanhao Grand Hotel!" "If you comply, I won't bother you. Otherwise, I'll make you regret it!" Su Nantian thought he had met a fool. He didn't want to bother. At this moment, the red light turned green, so he planned to start the engine and leave. Huang Dudu didn't care about traffic rules. Although the cars behind him kept honking, he ignored them. Seeing Su Nantian about to leave, Huang Dudu blocked the Phantom's front. "Kid, want to run? No way!" Huang Dudu said rudely. "Suyun, Jingjing, wait for me. I'll deal with this cockroach." Su Nantian said and got out of the car. Lin Suyun grabbed him: "Nantian, maybe it's better to ignore him. We still need to arrange the new house." "My grandfather's people are already waiting at Fengyue Community. Let's not waste time." Hearing Lin Suyun, Gao Jingjing also said: "Yes, Nantian brother, we should ignore him." At this moment, Huang Dudu called out again: "Kid, you're waiting. I've already reported it to the police. Now you still have a chance!" "Idiot!" Su Nantian muttered. Ignoring Lin Suyun's advice, Su Nantian still got out of the car. Huang Dudu thought the other party would submit. Their Porsche 911 and Rolls-Royce Phantom were parked in the middle of the main road, attracting many passing vehicles and pedestrians' attention. Besides those stuck behind who kept honking, more passersby thought the two luxury cars had collided. "What do you think, kid? Have you decided? My conditions still stand." "If you agree to my terms, I can call off the police now." Huang Dudu waved his phone while arrogantly speaking. He kept glancing at Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing in the Rolls-Royce. Su Nantian immediately recognized Huang Dudu as another Gao Qiguang-type. Both were useless, pretentious second-generation heirs. But he hated perverts eyeing his women. While Huang Dudu stood there carelessly, Su Nantian moved. Huang Dudu saw a blur pass between him and Su Nantian in just a few steps. Then his left cheek was slapped with a loud crack! Su Nantian had taken advantage of Huang Dudu's inattention, using his powerful physical strength to brutally beat him again. Huang Dudu was stunned, ears ringing, and completely dazed. Before he could recover, his right cheek received another heavy slap! Instantly, Huang Dudu's already not small face was swollen into a pig's head. Although beating someone on the face is taboo, Su Nantian's method was extremely humiliating. But compared to Gao Qiguang, Huang Dudu had been lucky. "You, you, you dare to hit me!" Huang Dudu covered his painful face and still spoke defiantly with blood trickling from his nose. Su Nantian raised his right hand, pretending to slap Huang Dudu. Huang Dudu quickly dodged but Su Nantian didn't strike. "Coward, pretending to be tough!" Su Nantian said disdainfully. At this moment, Su Nantian took out a lighter and lit a cigarette. Since returning to Earth, Su Nantian felt his nicotine addiction was unusually strong. He wanted a smoke whenever he had time. "You want to know where Gao Qiguang is? Want to know who I am?" Su Nantian took a deep puff of the cigarette and said to Huang Dudu. "I'll tell you, Gao Qiguang's balls were smashed last night and he should be in the hospital now. His car was given to me by his father." "As for who I am, you said He Lin Thirteen Nobles, right?" "I'm also the Beijing Thirteen Nobles!" Su Nantian had been influenced by various films recently. He remembered seeing a movie with the term "Beijing Thirteen Nobles." Su Nantian learned it on the spot and started making up nonsense to confront. Chapter 73: The Collapse of a Second-Generation Heir Just now, Huang Dudu was stunned and his head felt dizzy. Hearing Su Nantian say "Beijing Thirteen Nobles," he almost believed it. At this moment, Huang Dudu's phone received a message from the Thirteen Nobles group chat. His friends sent messages saying Gao Qiguang had been brutally beaten and hospitalized, even completely castrated. Huang Dudu read the message and looked up at Su Nantian, more puzzled. He thought this terrifying kid might truly be the Beijing Thirteen Nobles. Truly, people are better than others! Looking at Su Nantian's excessively handsome face, he had beaten Gao Qiguang and stolen a luxury car so carefree. There were two heavenly beauties in the car. Huang Dudu, who was usually defiant and arrogant, had to admit there were always better people out there. Due to Gao Qiguang's unexpected event, the Thirteen Nobles' original gathering was canceled. Huang Dudu knew he just needed to resolve this conflict with Su Nantian and it would be all good. "Sir, I'm sorry for not recognizing your greatness. Please forgive me and let it go." Huang Dudu was a person who feared the strong and respected the weak. When he met a tough opponent, he immediately became a coward. Su Nantian leaned against the front of the Phantom and said while smoking: "Oh, forgive you? Okay. You said earlier that the police were coming, so wait for them to come." Hearing this, Huang Dudu was even more annoyed. He thought his father had business cooperation with the police, so usually the police would give him some face. But this strange monster had beaten Gao Qiguang, who had such a thick background. Now he was still wandering around during the day without doing anything. His background must be beyond his father's. The Fengcheng police couldn't handle the sons of major families in Yanjing. He didn't remember much, but he remembered "Beijing Thirteen Nobles" deeply. After thinking for a while, Huang Dudu felt even more regretful about calling the police. At the same time, he cursed Gao Qiguang for getting involved with such a person! As the saying goes, evil deeds eventually lead to self-destruction. It's just that the time hadn't come yet. Su Nantian was relaxed, thinking about whether it would be Zhang Xue, that proud girl, who came to investigate. Since their last parting, Zhang Xue had no idea why she often thought of him when idle. He was so annoying and flirtatious; why think about him? Although Zhang Xue tried to suppress these feelings, they still occasionally surfaced uncontrollably. At this moment, Zhang Xue's patrol station suddenly received a call. Zhang Xue vaguely heard it was about a traffic dispute and didn't care. But after the call, Patrol Captain Feng Yue personally mobilized personnel to go out on duty. What kind of accident was this that even the captain came personally? Zhang Xue thought, out of professionalism, asked Feng Yue about the situation. "Xiao Xue, you don't know, this report was from Huang Dudu." After Feng Yue said the name, Zhang Xue burst out laughing. What a name! His parents must have no talent at all! It was clearly meant to prevent the child from learning well. Feng Yue wasn't surprised by Zhang Xue's reaction. He continued, "This kid's father is the president of He Lin Pharmaceutical, Huang Yuangu." "Huang Enterprise is a partner and equipment supplier for our patrol team." "So when this kid's father has something, the patrol team must give him some face." From Feng Yue's slightly reluctant tone, Zhang Xue guessed Huang Dudu was definitely not a good person. "By the way, Xiao Xue, this kid reported that the person he had a conflict with was named Su Nantian." After Feng Yue said this, Zhang Xue's whole body shook. It was really like thinking of the devil and he appears! Feng Yue saw Zhang Xue's reaction clearly unsettled. Considering their previous interactions, he thought his most capable subordinate had already fallen in love without realizing it. "Captain Feng, since this is an old acquaintance of ours, you don't need to trouble yourself. I'll take this mission." Zhang Xue pretended to be indifferent but was热心ly helping. Feng Yue was happy to go along with it. Since no traffic accident had occurred, Zhang Xue drove herself to the intersection where the report was made. On the way, Zhang Xue's mood was extremely complex. This pervert never stops causing trouble, always getting into strange and deep-rooted situations but managing to stay safe. Thinking about Su Nantian's previous actions, Zhang Xue was angry and scolded him for being a troublemaker. But when he saved her, he had been so brave and handsome! And his body was so good; those special forces guys couldn't compare to him! The tough girl Zhang Xue unconsciously became infatuated without realizing it, affecting her driving. "Can you drive at all? The patrol team is so important!" "Clearly, a big chest means no brains. What kind of car is this!" "Missy, since you're so pretty, call me 'uncle,' and I won't care about your bad driving!" On the way, Zhang Xue drove without any rules because she was distracted thinking about Su Nantian. "Ah-choo!" Su Nantian suddenly sneezed, still smoking a cigarette. "Who the hell is cursing me? Is it you, the sloppily-haired one!" Su Nantian said and lightly smacked Huang Dudu's back of the head. Huang Dudu cried out in innocence. In such a short time, Huang Dudu was completely subdued by Su Nantian like an obedient underling.
