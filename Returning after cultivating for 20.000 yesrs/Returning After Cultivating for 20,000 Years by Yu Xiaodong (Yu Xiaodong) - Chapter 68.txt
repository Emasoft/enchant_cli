"Share hardship together?"
That's a joke! The boss is already gone. What can these little lackeys do but become cannon fodder?

Su Nantian and Yue Xiaoshan arrived at the company's front entrance, not waiting for the driver to park the car properly. They rushed out just as several employees who had collected their monthly wages stumbled out of the gates.

Watching this group of reckless people nearly撞 into Yue Xiaoshan, Su Nantian quickly stepped forward to block their path.

"Who are you? Can't you watch where you're going?"
One of them collided with Su Nantian's solid chest and shouted angrily. The sudden unemployment had hit them hard.

"What are you going to do?"
Su Nantian asked, his face cold as he observed them carrying bags and packages.

"You're also from this company? Just leave, Xinyue is about to go bankrupt. Even the boss was killed!"
A frantic employee stammered, then suddenly spotted Yue Xiaoshan stepping out from behind Su Nantian with a frown. He stammered loudly, "Yue, Yue Director?"

But hadn't the news of Yue Director's death already been confirmed? Who was this person before him?

The employee's scream drew many people from the lobby. Seeing Yue Xiaoshan unharmed, their expressions varied—some surprised, some regretful, others joyful or excited.

The regretful ones were the very people who had bumped into Su Nantian earlier. Now they wished they could turn back time, for if they had known Yue Xiaoshan's death was a rumor, they would never have resigned.

But now it was too late; they had already spoken their intention to leave in front of Yue Xiaoshan. There was no way they could stay now. They slinked away, clutching their belongings.

"Director Yue!"
Wu Han rushed out first upon hearing the news of Yue Xiaoshan's return. She looked at her unharmed, then sighed in relief before running over to check Yue Xiaoshan's body for hidden injuries.

"You're safe! That's great!"
Wu Han knew Yue Xiaoshan was a woman who could create miracles. She would surely help Xinyue through this crisis again. Thinking of that, she gripped Yue Xiaoshan's hands excitedly.

"Hey hey, Wu Manager, at least show some concern for me! My role in your safe return shouldn't be ignored."
Su Nantian said, then dramatically spread his arms for a hug.

"Get lost!"
Wu Han gave him a withering look and pushed his hands away. She grabbed Yue Xiaoshan's arm, then led her toward the meeting room, leaving Su Nantian with two alluring silhouettes.

Though they teased each other, Wu Han, as the financial manager, knew how severe Xinyue's crisis was. She didn't know if Yue Xiaoshan could survive this unprecedented business war.

"Xiaohan, what's the situation now?"
After entering the meeting room, Yue Xiaoshan instantly adopted her icy businesswoman persona. She looked at the anxious senior managers and turned to Wu Han.

"Director Yue, look."
Wu Han immediately activated five large screens in the meeting room. Ten graphs of plummeting stock prices appeared before Yue Xiaoshan's eyes.

"How could this happen?"
She narrowed her eyes. Xinyue's situation was like being surrounded by enemies on all sides. All subsidiaries under Xinyue had suffered the same level of stock market shock.

Stocks plummeted, countless subsidiaries declared bankruptcy, and Xinyue was barely holding on with years of savings.

"This..."
Yue Xiaoshan was stunned. As one of Jiangcheng's leading enterprises, Xinyue had faced such a formidable opponent. Their financial power must have far exceeded her budget.

But she quickly calmed down, her eyes devoid of any emotion as countless precise data flashed before her mind.

"Sell the C-shares. Instruct all stock market employees to prepare for battle," Yue Xiaoshan ordered into the intercom.

Meanwhile, in a high-end club on the outskirts of Jiangcheng, Yue Lin had just received news that Yue Xiaoshan was alive.

"What? Yue Xiaoshan isn't dead?"
Yue Lin was shocked, glaring at a middle-aged man beside him. "What kind of assassin did you find? How could you fail to kill a woman?"

The middle-aged man didn't answer immediately. He took out a pair of chopsticks and played with them.

"I don't know why the shadow failed this time, but it's better this way. Your niece has disgraced you in Jiangcheng. Killing her would be too merciful," the man said calmly.

"But Yue Xiaoshan has extraordinary talent in business. If she returns safely, even the dead could be revived!"
Yue Lin protested, knowing his niece well.

"You think a small company can fight against us? Mr. Yue, your experience is too limited. You don't understand—destroying the thing someone hates most brings the greatest joy!"
The man spoke, then suddenly crushed a bird in its cage with his chopsticks.

The bird cried out in agony, and the man wiped blood splatter from his hands before continuing. "Besides, we have informants feeding us intelligence, right? Now Xinyue is like a naked woman before us. Do you think she can hide anything from us?"

Yue Lin said nothing more, not mentioning Su Nantian's presence to the middle-aged man. He believed that the Japanese assassin organization could handle even a small person like Su Nantian.

"Mr. Yue, we agreed I'd destroy Xinyue, and you'd provide intelligence. After success, we split the profits fifty-fifty."
Hearing the man restate the conditions, Yue Lin reluctantly agreed. Without this group's help, even his knowledge of Xinyue's depth would be useless.

Yue Lin nodded and re-signed the contract with this untrustworthy assassin organization.

"Ha ha, good! Order to use half of the organization's liquid funds to attack Xinyue's stock market!"
The middle-aged man's laughter echoed through the empty VIP room. Yue Lin also smiled slyly.

"I wonder how Xiaoshan's situation is going."
Meanwhile, Su Nantian, bored in the chairman's office, decided to go downstairs to find Yue Xiaoshan. After all, during this life-or-death moment for the company, as a half-employee of Xinyue, it was pointless to just sit and do nothing.

"Director Yue, they've injected more funds again!"
"What? How is that possible?"
Yue Xiaoshan, buried in stock reports, suddenly looked up. She saw Su Nantian enter the meeting room.

In an instant, Su Nantian noticed her eyes filled with red veins. In less than an hour, she had already been exhausted to this state.

Yue Xiaoshan ignored her dizziness and rushed to Wu Han's computer, watching the wild fluctuations of red and green lines on the screen. She felt her mind go numb—whether from overwork or mental stimulation, she nearly stumbled to the ground.

"Xiaoshan!"
Su Nantian quickly caught Yue Xiaoshan's limp body. She leaned on his shoulder, despairing as everything about Xinyue slipped through her fingers like water.

"Who the hell are they? Why target Xinyue so fiercely?"
Yue Xiaoshan's eyes flashed with cold fury, her teeth clenched.

Even if she had the talent of a master in dire situations, against an opponent who financially crushed her, she could only sit and wait for death. Death wasn't terrifying; waiting to die was the most tormenting.

Su Nantian watched Yue Xiaoshan's red-rimmed eyes, his heart trembling. This non-physical war was truly terrifying.

Chapter 328: The Building is About to Collapse
"Ha ha, great! Come on, Mr. Dog, I must raise a glass to you!"
In the high-end club outside Jiangcheng, Yue Lin laughed like a monkey in heat. He raised his glass to the middle-aged man beside him, Mr. Dog Goushilang.

"Mr. Yue, are you feeling the joy of power now?"
Goushilang took the glass without hesitation and drank it in one go. Then he turned the bottom upside down, letting a few drops of red wine fall onto the oak floor.

"Yes, it's great to see that little girl Yue Xiaoshan suffer." Yue Lin nodded excitedly.

"But power brings joy, but it also brings misfortune, Mr. Yue. I hope you understand this."
Suddenly, Goushilang's eyes narrowed. He crushed the wine glass in his hand, sending shards flying everywhere. Surprisingly, his palm remained unscathed.

Yue Lin was startled by the sudden action. He had long known that collaborating with Japanese people was like dealing with devils, but to seize Xinyue and suppress Yue Xiaoshan, he had no choice.

A small Xinyue was nothing compared to his ambitions. After all, his goal was the head of the Yue family!

But Xinyue was also something he couldn't lose. Seeing Goushilang's strange gaze, Yue Lin instinctively swallowed his saliva and asked, "Mr. Dog, are you trying to back out?"

"No no, how could that be? Mr. Yue, you know our country has a saying: the duck in your mouth flies away. Don't make assumptions before things are over, Mr. Yue."
Goushilang sat upright and said.

Yue Lin felt a flicker of dislike as the man's fake attitude. His confidence was written all over his face, clearly showing arrogance and self-importance.

"So let's cook this duck, then split it open and pour soy sauce over it! Waiter, hurry up and make a traditional crispy roast duck. Make sure to use the fattest white ducks so Mr. Dog can taste it!"
Yue Lin thought about his future rise, feeling invincible. He arrogantly snapped his fingers and ordered the waiter at the door.

Such high-end entertainment clubs naturally offered one-stop service. Making a simple roast duck was trivial.

"Mr. Dog, do you think this duck can escape?"
"Yes, unless they have more money than us. Even if he flies away, I can cut his wings!"
Goushilang said, then exaggeratedly made a slicing motion. He also innocently spread his hands: "Who could be richer than us? Ha ha!"

"Ha ha, Mr. Dog is mighty! I don't believe Yue Xiaoshan can find a savior for Xinyue!"
Yue Lin laughed along.

In the largest meeting room of Xinyue Group:
"Manager Wu, issue instructions. Take all the money we can get and pay the remaining employees their wages, then tell them I, Yue Xiaoshan, have failed them."
Yue Xiaoshan looked at the stock market that had stopped moving and whispered, her head down. No one could see her expression, but a few drops of crystal-clear tears fell beneath her.

"Xiaoshan."
Wu Han looked at Yue Xiaoshan's trembling body with deep concern. Her eyes were also veiled by a thin mist.

This wasn't just work for her; she and Yue Xiaoshan were close friends outside of work. Now that the company was bankrupt, Wu Han felt no sorrow from losing her job—only deep sadness for Yue Xiaoshan.

"Everyone, leave. Let me be alone."
Yue Xiaoshan said, standing up from the chair she had sat in for two years. She turned and left the meeting room. To others, Xinyue was just a job, but to her, it was her life!

It was her father's pride—had it been destroyed by her own hands?

Yue Xiaoshan touched the small decorations around here and knelt to cry.

"Xiaoshan, what's wrong?"
Su Nantian asked softly.

"Su Nantian, leave. From now on, you're free. Your bodyguard mission is over."
Yue Xiaoshan spoke in a voice devoid of emotion. How heartbreaking those words were!

Su Nantian had never seen Yue Xiaoshan in such a state. As the closest opposite-sex companion, his worry for her was no less than Wu Han's.

But just as he wanted to go over and comfort Yue Xiaoshan, Wu Han pulled him back with tears in her eyes: "Let her be alone."

Wu Han shook her head at Su Nantian and signaled him to follow.

"Manager Wu, what's going on? Did Xinyue just collapse like that?"
Su Nantian, who knew nothing about business, was completely confused. He had strength and intelligence but helplessly couldn't assist Yue Xiaoshan at all.

"Su Nantian, if Yue Xiaoshan isn't the radiant Director anymore, would you still stay by her side like this?"
Wu Han suddenly asked Su Nantian, who was walking with her to the finance department.

"What do you mean? Do you think I'm a greedy person?"
Su Nantian's face darkened. When had he ever cared about money? He was angry.

"No, I just worry you'll leave like those people when Xinyue goes bankrupt."
Wu Han's face was slightly embarrassed. Before they even reached the finance department, several employees with sad faces saw her and rushed over.

"Manager Wu, you've finally come! We want to resign! Pay us our annual wages quickly!"
They spoke firmly. Their masculinity was pitiful compared to women's courage.

Chapter 329: Ungrateful Scum
Wu Han looked at these old employees with disdain. For the first time, she felt a desire to defy Yue Xiaoshan's orders.

As Xinyue's financial manager, she naturally knew how deep the company was in debt now. These people didn't even want to stick with Xinyue through this crisis, instead taking advantage of the situation.

"I understand those people left, but Feng Liang, you old employees have worked for Xinyue for so long. You know how good Director Yue was to you. Now you just walk away and want wages? Dream on!" Wu Han narrowed her eyes coldly.

"Manager Wu, I respect you as my former boss and call you Manager Wu. Now Xinyue's tree has fallen, it's over. If you don't comply, we'll get rough!"
Feng Liang and the other men threatened with their large bodies.

BANG!
Su Nantian hated traitors most. After being betrayed in the battlefield, he had almost died. He never expected to find such ungrateful people in the business world. Without hesitation, he rushed over and punched one of them in the face.

"I'm telling you, you little bastard, without Yue Xiaoshan's protection, you're nothing! Xinyue is already over!"
The old employee wiped the blood from his nose and continued to yell angrily: "I'll expose Xinyue's abuse of employees. If you don't pay me my wages today, I'll destroy everyone's reputation!"

"You say one more word, and you won't live to reach the media."
Su Nantian grabbed his collar and whispered, releasing a sudden aura of death that silenced everyone.

"Su Nantian, let him go."
At this moment, Yue Xiaoshan arrived at the finance department. She appeared like a ghost, calmly telling Su Nantian.

"Xiaoshan."
Su Nantian looked at Yue Xiaoshan, who seemed like a zombie. His heart ached deeply.

"Let him go. You leave, don't bother me anymore!"
Yue Xiaoshan couldn't bear Su Nantian's concerned gaze. As a female business leader, this was her greatest defeat. She didn't want Su Nantian to see her in such a pitiful state, so she suddenly ordered him harshly.

"Haha."
Su Nantian was stunned by Yue Xiaoshan's sudden shout, but he wasn't someone who would take abuse. He let out a cold laugh that pierced Yue Xiaoshan's heart.

He watched Yue Xiaoshan silently, then punched one of the old employees in the stomach. As that man groaned, he turned and left.

"Su Nantian!"
Seeing Su Nantian angry too, Wu Han glared at Yue Xiaoshan with reproach and was about to go after him.

"Xiaohan, pay these people their annual wages."
Yue Xiaoshan's calm voice returned, but it was like a huge stone that stirred a storm in Wu Han's heart.

"Director Yue! They betrayed Xinyue!"
Wu Han asked in disbelief, her eyes filled with confusion.

"Do as I said. When you take the wages, leave. From now on, you have no connection with Xinyue Group. I hope you won't speak ill of Xinyue behind our backs, or I'll never forgive you."
Yue Xiaoshan said. Her calm eyes flashed with a ripple, and an icy chill swept over the traitors. She turned and left, her beautiful figure now more melancholic.

The old employees no longer feared Yue Xiaoshan's coldness. They smiled at her back, indifferent. Xinyue was at its end; how could they regret their decision?

Those who still wanted to stay and believe in miracles would just share Xinyue's debt.

"Hmph, I don't believe Director Yue is so powerful she can find money to save Xinyue."
"Shut up, you ungrateful scum!"
The old employee who had been punched by Su Nantian was the finance department's accountant. As an accountant, he naturally knew how terrible Xinyue's debt was now.

He rubbed his aching stomach and sarcastically said, "You think I don't know? I'm the finance department's accountant. Now Xinyue has lost four billion, and I don't believe Director Yue can get that much money in half an hour!"

"Uh... so Xinyue lacks money? Why didn't you say that earlier? I thought the business war was complicated. Turns out it doesn't need all those complicated steps."
Su Nantian muttered awkwardly, his expression suddenly becoming strange. He casually dropped the male accountant on the ground.

Then he looked at Wu Han and shrugged: "Why didn't you say it was money? It would have been easier if you told me earlier."

The accountant looked at Su Nantian with mockery and sneered: "What do you mean? Do you think a small bodyguard can just pull out four billion?"

In fact, only Yue Xiaoshan knew Su Nantian's true identity. Others, including Wu Han, thought he was just a bodyguard hired by the Yue family.

At that moment, everyone understood this situation. The big boss, Yue Xiaoshan, had already gone bankrupt. What could a bodyguard do?

Wu Han frowned after hearing Su Nantian's words. Although she knew Su Nantian didn't care about money, his attitude had always shown that.

But no matter how she thought, she couldn't connect him with someone who could pull out four billion. She just thought he was trying to show off unnecessarily.

"Su Nantian, stop talking. Let them go."
Wu Han said and was about to lead the smug old employees into the finance department.

Chapter 330: Supreme Black Card
"Hey, Manager Wu, you were worried about Xinyue earlier. Now that the life raft is right in front of you, why don't you grab it?"
Su Nantian didn't have any intention to show off. He was even a bit speechless—did he really look like someone who wasn't rich?

"Ha ha, kid, don't talk nonsense. If you can pull out four billion, I'll kneel and call you grandpa!"
As the chief accountant of Jiangcheng's leading enterprise, he naturally understood Jiangcheng's economic level and some super-rich people. A bodyguard like Su Nantian wouldn't even be able to pull out five million, let alone five billion.

"Oh? Then you said it clearly. I hope you don't regret it."
Su Nantian's eyes narrowed as he heard the man's provocation. A mysterious smile appeared on his lips.

"Good, if what you said was nonsense, then you have to bow three times and call me grandpa, okay?"
The accountant didn't deliberately provoke Su Nantian. He just wanted to annoy him.

"Haha."
Su Nantian said nothing more and grabbed Wu Han's hand, walking forward.

"Su Nantian, what are you doing?"
Wu Han looked at Su Nantian with a complex expression. Did this man who had always been mysterious really have a way?

"Shh, Manager Wu. Don't talk so much. I prefer to speak with facts."
Su Nantian gave Wu Han, who was worried, a big smile.

"I didn't mean that. The accounting room is this way. You're going the wrong way..."
Wu Han covered her face and said.

"Okay."
Entering the accounting room, Su Nantian immediately saw the latest stock market situation of Xinyue Group on the central screen. Wu Han, standing behind him, saw the red line continuing to drop and her face turned even more grim.

The male accountant laughed triumphantly: "Haha, heaven is on my side. Even Jiangcheng's richest man can't save Xinyue."

"What's going on, Manager Wu?"
Su Nantian didn't understand the meaning and turned to ask Wu Han in a low voice.

"Xinyue lost another billion."
Wu Han explained with a grim face. It seemed the hidden enemies were determined to destroy Xinyue and Yue Xiaoshan completely. She didn't know what Yue Xiaoshan was thinking now; if she saw it, she would probably be sad again.

"Big deal. It's just another billion."
Su Nantian said his inner thoughts, but no matter how he tried to be calm in expressing these amounts, they sounded different in Wu Han and the male accountant's ears.

"Haha, do you think you're a rich man? A small goal of one billion?"
The male accountant mocked again without hesitation.

Su Nantian said nothing more but looked at him with pity. Then he took out a seemingly brand-new black card from his pocket.

"Su Nantian, maybe it's better not to."
Wu Han saw the strange card and slapped her forehead, preparing to stop him. But Su Nantian stopped her.

At that moment, everyone finally saw the black card Su Nantian had taken out. The male accountant who had been shouting earlier suddenly stopped talking, staring wide-eyed at the card in his hand.

"Is this a Supreme VIP Black Card?"
Knowing all bank cards was a basic requirement for accountants, and most people in the room dealt with finance, they immediately recognized it.

They all knew that cards of this level required a one-million-yuan deposit and tenfold the overdraft limit. That is, depositing one million allows an overdraft of ten million, and so on.

Only truly rich people would have the time to deposit over one million into this card.

Did Su Nantian, this small bodyguard, really not lie?

After thinking about Su Nantian's background, the male accountant shook his head in self-mockery. Su Nantian had been at the company for a short time, and his resume wasn't a secret. Everyone had seen it.

The resume was very simple, cleaner than most people's faces. Even if he had a Supreme Black Card, it was probably just a useless card or at most one million.

"Hey, Miss, please transfer five billion from this card to inject capital into Xinyue!"
Su Nantian, as if playing with a toy, casually threw the Supreme Black Card to a female employee in the accounting department.

He then turned and asked Wu Han, who was stunned: "Did I use the right words? Does that count as injecting capital?"

He didn't know what his action was, so he just grabbed a word from memory.

But he didn't realize that injecting six billion into Xinyue meant becoming the second-largest shareholder, not just a free sponsorship.

"It... it does."
Wu Han stared at the scene in disbelief. The development of events had far exceeded her expectations.

That vague possibility she had previously considered was becoming clearer. Looking at Su Nantian, who remained calm, a warm current suddenly rose in her heart.

The female accountant who received the black card hadn't seen such a situation before. A small bodyguard casually took out a black card and asked to transfer five billion—this was shocking.

She looked at the brand-new black card in her hand and asked hesitantly: "Mr. Su, are you sure it's five billion?"

"Transfer it and stop asking so many questions!"
Before Su Nantian could answer, the male accountant, tired of waiting, shouted at the female accountant. He didn't care about their former friendship.

He had already sensed something was wrong and his bad feeling kept growing.

The female accountant looked at him with disdain, then turned around to use a card reader and started an online transaction.

"Beep!"
After swiping the magnetic strip, Su Nantian's Supreme Black Card made a clear sound.

Since the female accountant was facing away from Su Nantian and others, no one else knew how much money was in it.

Even Su Nantian himself didn't remember how much money was on the card. He wasn't short of money, and he rarely paid attention to dozens of millions or even hundreds of millions.

Moreover, his expenses were minimal, and he had long become numb to the numbers on his card. However, others didn't know his background.

Chapter 331: The Bet
Seeing the female accountant stop after swiping the card, Feng Liang and the other male accountants were overjoyed. They thought the money wasn't enough, so they mocked Su Nantian and waited for him to kneel and call them grandpa.

But then, a clear electronic voice came from the computer, which slapped their faces.

"Dear user, your transfer of five billion has been successful! Thank you for cooperating!"

"My god!"
After half a minute, the old employees who had previously doubted Su Nantian all screamed in unison. Even Wu Han, hearing the voice from the computer, had wide eyes and looked at Su Nantian in disbelief.

Then her face showed joy. She didn't want to think too much about why Su Nantian had this money, but what truly made her happy was that Xinyue Group might be saved!

She didn't know how Xiaoshan would react, so she looked at the man beside her again. He had sharp eyebrows and starry eyes, a smile full of mischief on his face—how could he be someone who casually pulled out five billion?

"What's wrong, Manager Wu? Are you asking for a relationship?"
Su Nantian felt Wu Han's strange gaze and smiled at her.

"Go to hell! You're not worthy of it."
Wu Han blushed and scolded. Although she was shocked by Su Nantian's wealth, she wasn't that shallow to be a gold-digger. Otherwise, she wouldn't have refused so many rich men's proposals before.

But Wu Han's reaction was enviable, especially the female accountant who transferred money for Su Nantian. After hearing Wu Han's cold reply, she felt a wave of emotions inside her. I don't want to, but I do!

She had seen the balance on the account when she swiped the card. As someone who dealt with money all her life, she had never seen such a huge amount before. The complicated Arabic numbers in front of the decimal point made her dizzy for a moment.

"Who is he?"
She had self-awareness and knew she was plain-looking, so for a man like Su Nantian, the richest person in the world, she could only flirt with him. Besides, there was Wu Han, a beautiful woman by his side—how could he look at her?

Su Nantian looked at the female accountant who kept making eyes at him and felt confused. He didn't think about the meaning of her actions but turned around to look at the old employees who were trying to sneak away.

"Hey, what are you doing?"
"Nothing..."
Seeing Su Nantian's cold smile, the old employees stopped. They never imagined that Su Nantian was actually a billionaire hidden in Xinyue Group!

A bodyguard for the boss, but richer than the boss himself. That's not fair at all!

The old employees roared in their hearts but didn't dare to show any defiance. They smiled and thought Su Nantian, a rich man with money, wouldn't take it seriously.

"Hey, Mr. Su, we have to go to work now. It's not allowed to chat during working hours!"
One old employee smiled nervously, thinking about how Xinyue had been saved. He wouldn't be so foolish to resign again because he couldn't find a company with the same benefits as Xinyue in Jiangcheng.

"Haha."
Su Nantian still smiled, but everyone felt a deeper coldness.

"Xinyue won't keep those who betray it. Get out!"
Wu Han didn't expect these traitors to change so quickly—they were like grasshoppers. She naturally wouldn't let such a group stay in the company.

"Don't be like that, Manager Wu. We're all colleagues. It's because of life's pressures. Why be so harsh?"
One employee under Wu Han's management tried to play the emotional card. Wu Han frowned and looked at Su Nantian, wanting to know how he would handle these shameless people.

"Manager Wu said it already. Get out, didn't you hear?"
Su Nantian narrowed his eyes. He wasn't bullying people; he had seen and remembered the actions of these people during Xinyue's critical moment.

Now that Xinyue had escaped danger, they wanted to come back and take the cake. There was no such thing as a free lunch in the world.

"Who wants to be friendly with you? By the way, who are you? Yes, it's you!"
Su Nantian pointed at the male accountant who had bet with him earlier. The man was scared, thinking Su Nantian still remembered the bet.

"Did you forget it?"
Sure enough, Su Nantian reminded him kindly.

"No..."
