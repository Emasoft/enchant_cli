As he pulled out a slip of paper, Gao Jingjing snatched it from his hand.

"Classmate, please wait a moment," Gao Jingjing said, returning the slip to the principal's desk. Her eyes conveyed something to the principal, who shrank back slightly and slowly unfolded the paper, reading aloud a name: "Wang Zhijie."

Qian Fachen was stunned. Wang Zhijie was the backbone of his team, a pillar of strength. Now he had been drawn out—leaving only these useless companions! Qian Fachen's eyes darted between the remaining players, his gaze dark and vengeful.

Wang Zhijie touched his nose and obediently left the volleyball court.

"Alright, now it's fair, isn't it?" Su Nantian smiled at Qian Fachen, who was fuming.

Qian Fachen let out a cold laugh: "Fair? What about Song Jin's condition? I haven't even seen any blood. Who gains and who loses?"

Su Nantian cast him a cold glance, saying: "Don't rush. The account isn't settled yet."

In the stands, Wu Lianxing watched Qian Fachen's foolishness and shook her head, muttering to Gao Jingjing: "Look at him. He really deserves it."

Gao Jingjing covered her mouth, laughing softly as she shoved the lottery slip into Wu Lianxing's arms. "Your method was better."

Wu Lianxing winked proudly and drew another slip from the drum. The paper read: "Wang Zhijie."

After adjustments, both teams were roughly balanced. Yet such an imbalanced match was unprecedented. The referee in the middle couldn't help but twitch his lips.

Clearing his throat, the referee blew the whistle again.

The third set began.

Still led by Qian Fachen, he cradled the ball with a sinister look in his eyes. He didn't rush to serve but instead scrutinized Su Nantian's weakest link.

Previously it was Song Jin, and now Qian Fachen turned his venomous gaze toward He Tao, whose arm bore a bruise.

Seizing the opportunity, Qian Fachen smirked, lifting the volleyball high before leaping and hurling it toward He Tao.

Chapter 217: Cowardice

The ball flew with a "hissing" sound through the air, revealing how much force Qian Fachen had used.

It soared directly toward He Tao, who was momentarily stunned before reacting. He rushed to jump from the ground and return the ball with a powerful hit.

But as he leapt, his arm overexerted itself, and the bruise on his arm ached. His strength failed him, and the ball merely grazed him before landing with a thud.

This was the first time Su Nantian's class failed to catch the ball. Gao Jingjing and Wu Lianxing in the stands were surprised, as were the students of both classes. Yet a moment later, Class Two erupted into loud cheers.

The intensity was no less than after a victory.

He Tao awkwardly retrieved the ball from the sand, glancing at Su Nantian with a sheepish look. Su Nantian remained calm and nodded.

He Tao swallowed hard, his bruised arm throbbing again. Su Nantian noticed the weakness and asked: "How's your arm?"

He Tao looked up at Su Nantian, his eyes narrowing. "N-no... it's fine."

But the expression on his face didn't match his words. Because of the mistake, He Tao gripped the ball so tightly that his knuckles turned white.

Gao's brothers and Liu Yang noticed this and hurried over, whispering: "Your arm looks more swollen. Are you sure it's okay?"

Liu Yang added: "How could it be? You all saw the serve. He Tao couldn't even muster strength, so he couldn't catch it, let alone return it."

The referee high above flipped the score to 2-1 and blew his whistle. Qian Fachen's face finally brightened, a rare smile spreading across it. He had now focused entirely on He Tao, planning to direct every ball toward him—no need for concern about points.

In his mind, Qian Fachen already saw a glimmer of hope and even regarded Su Nantian with pity. He thought: "What good is individual strength? Unfortunately, he has such a group of useless teammates."

As he thought about his "teammates," Qian Fachen glanced at Li Xiao. Li Xiao was wiping sweat from his arm, watching Su Nantian's every move with tension. Qian Fachen didn't call him, and Li Xiao naturally dared not glance at Qian Fachen.

Seeing Li Xiao's actions, Qian Fachen finally smiled slightly.

On the other side, Liu Yang tugged Su Nantian's sleeve anxiously: "Look at him now. His injury is so severe, how can he continue? Song Jin's resting; let him rest too."

He Tao heard this and panicked, immediately tossing the ball to the ground. "It was just a mistake. This injury doesn't matter... it won't affect much."

Both stared at Su Nantian, but he gave no answer. He simply watched them, as if knowing they had more to say.

Indeed, under Su Nantian's silence, Liu Yang said: "He Tao's weakness is too obvious. Qian Fachen has already targeted him. All the balls will be thrown at He Tao, and his injury will only get worse."

Liu Yang's concern for He Tao was unexpected. He looked at Liu Yang with a complex expression, feeling both gratitude and urgency.

Liu Yang pressed his lips together: "Honestly, my injury is painful, but I can't avoid this match. If we lose another person, we'll be defeated without a fight."

This was also Su Nantian's inner thought. Losing another person, no matter how strong his individual ability was, it was a team match. Even if only Su Nantian remained on the field, he would win. But that victory had another meaning—defeat without a fight.

There was no team that abandoned its companions.

Both had spoken their hearts to Su Nantian, leaving the decision to him. But the difficulty of choosing was heartbreaking for Gao's brothers.

They didn't want to lose the match, nor did they want to abandon their comrades.

In an instant, Su Nantian said: "Continue the match." As he turned, he patted He Tao's other arm and said: "I'll protect you."

He Tao's face lit up, hurriedly following Su Nantian and yielding the position. With Su Nantian's assurance, no matter how worried Liu Yang was, he couldn't object. He accepted the decision and took his place.

The referee blew the whistle again, and the fourth set began with Class One serving.

Su Nantian held the ball but didn't rush to serve, instead playing with it leisurely. He glanced at Qian Fachen, who was clearly agitated.

"Hey!" Li Xiao saw Qian Fachen's expression and felt a chill, shouting at Su Nantian: "Are you going to serve or not? Did the ball hit you too hard!"

Li Xiao had been placed on a blacklist by Su Nantian's group, along with Qian Fachen—mutual enemies. When Li Xiao urged him like this, Su Nantian wasn't angry. He slowly picked up the ball and examined Li Xiao's expression.

It looked as if he were about to smash it into Li Xiao's face. Li Xiao panicked, glancing at Qian Fachen, but found he hadn't turned to look.

Su Nantian took in all of Li Xiao's emotions, a faint cold smile on his lips. In an instant, his lightning-fast movement sent the volleyball crashing toward Li Xiao.

Su Nantian's speed was like a flash of lightning, making the ball's trajectory hard to track. It soared through the air with a sudden wave before Li Xiao let out a groan, clutching his stomach and collapsing to the ground. A volleyball rolled slowly beside him.

The referee's lips twitched as he considered it, then marked the score 3-1.

Another whistle blew, and Qian Fachen recovered from his shock. He realized Su Nantian's speed was beyond him.

A sense of fear crept into Qian Fachen's heart. He was afraid of this deep, unfathomable Su Nantian, unsure of his strength or whether the next ball would hit him.

Chapter 218: Scolding

Qian Fachen was certain of one thing: he had angered Su Nantian.

From the faint smile on Su Nantian's face, Qian Fachen felt no warmth—only waves of coldness approaching him.

This feeling made Qian Fachen afraid. In all his previous provocations, Su Nantian had never shown this expression.

But in this moment, Qian Fachen felt genuine fear.

This fear made him involuntarily swallow his saliva and step back two steps, as if distancing himself from Su Nantian would reduce the pressure.

Li Xiao lay on the ground for a long time, but no teammates came to help him. Qian Fachen was too preoccupied with fearing Su Nantian to care about Li Xiao on the ground.

Without Qian Fachen's signal, these teammates dared not help Li Xiao, only exchanging glances in the sand.

Gao Zhiheng let out a cold snort and stepped forward, pointing at Qian Fachen and shouting: "I thought you were a united class. How could you let your classmates fall to the ground and not help them?"

Gao Zhiheng's loud voice spread, prompting the audience to whisper among themselves. Soon, Qian Fachen's ears were filled with "ungrateful," "disloyal," and "he doesn't deserve it."

Realizing this, Qian Fachen hurriedly pointed at Li Xiao and shouted to his teammates: "Hurry up, help him!"

The teammates hesitated but rushed forward. However, Li Xiao moved first.

He had lain face-down on the ground motionless before, but now his fingers curled tightly into the sand. He coughed violently, sending sand swirling across the ground.

Li Xiao inhaled sand while coughing, causing him to inhale it continuously. Qian Fachen couldn't bear Li Xiao's embarrassment and rushed forward, grabbing him by the collar and lifting him up.

This action startled Qian Fachen. Li Xiao's nose and mouth were bleeding, his eyes bloodshot as if he had been beaten severely.

Seeing Li Xiao's condition, Su Nantian felt a little relief.

Su Nantian had put effort into that volleyball, carefully aiming to hit Li Xiao's weakness without knocking him out. It had taken him half a second of thought.

Now, it seemed the ball had been perfectly executed, satisfying Su Nantian.

Everyone on the field realized that Su Nantian had done it intentionally, but what was his purpose? To avenge Song Jin and He Tao?

In an instant, although Su Nantian had knocked Li Xiao to blood, he also gained the admiration and respect of many students.

Watching Li Xiao, who was still breathing heavily but standing straight, Qian Fachen frowned and extended his hand to the referee: "My team member was injured during the match. I request a substitution."

The referee couldn't decide, naturally turning to the principal for help.

Having understood Su Nantian's intention, the principal would never risk offending him at this moment. On the podium, the principal looked serious and opened the microphone, speaking to Qian Fachen but making it clear to everyone on the field.

The principal cleared his throat and said firmly: "Substitute who? Easily replacing teammates—what kind of team match is this?"

Even Qian Fachen could see the principal was clearly supporting Su Nantian. At this moment, his desire to win crumbled further. But the principal still didn't want to miss this chance to please Su Nantian.

Since they had already offended the Qian family, it was better to go all the way and solidify their relationship with Su Nantian.

Thinking this, the principal cleared his throat again and said: "Look at Class One's team. He Tao is still playing despite the injury. I see your Li Xiao? His body isn't bad, just hit by a ball and fell down. How could he be so weak?"

The principal's tone gradually turned cold: "If it were that easy to replace, the world would be simple! Continue the match!" After saying this, the principal turned off the microphone and gave Qian Fachen a fake angry look.

Li Xiao was also curious. He had been hit by one ball and bled, but his body felt no discomfort except for a dizzy head. He was the same as usual.

So Li Xiao cautiously said to Qian Fachen: "I'm fine, I can still play."

Qian Fachen had already been frightened by Su Nantian and upset by the principal. His mood was extremely bad. Even when Li Xiao carefully explained, Qian Fachen only let out a cold snort: "Then don't hold us back. If not Su Nantian, you'll have a hard time too."

Li Xiao shivered at the threat but the principal had already refused his substitution request. At this moment, Li Xiao was just giving Qian Fachen a way out.

The students in the stands didn't know Li Xiao's situation with Qian Fachen or his misdeeds. They just saw it as a "younger brother disrespecting an elder" drama.

At this moment, the audience's curses spread. A girl sitting next to Gao Jingjing shouted: "Qian Fachen, are you even a person? How dare you talk to your classmates like that! Do you think you're the master?"

Although Qian's family was considered upper class at school, there were always people higher than them. Take the Gao and Lin families for example—they were far superior, not to mention the many families under the Gao clan.

Therefore, no matter how they relied on their family background outside, in some special groups at Fengyue University, Qian Fachen was just a junior.

Qian Fachen's forehead veins bulged, showing how angry he was. Gao Jingjing pulled the girl's hand and said: "Qian Fachen really is too much."

Seeing Gao Jingjing holding her hand, the girl's joy deepened. She longed to punch Qian Fachen twice to gain more favor from Gao Jingjing, thus elevating her status in the family.

So this girl cursed more enthusiastically. She first gently patted Gao Jingjing's hand and said: "I'll be careful. This kind of person needs to be taught a lesson."

Chapter 219: Victory

Then, as the girl turned her face toward Qian Fachen, it instantly became a fierce expression. This made Gao's brothers shudder and remarked: "Who is this girl? I've seen her arrogance."

He Tao rubbed his shoulder and approached Gao Zhiheng, whispering: "I heard she's from the Xue family in the north. A scholarly family raised two arrogant girls."

Liu Yang was surprised: "Two? Who's the other one?"

He Tao was about to speak when he saw Xu Jia'er, the second daughter of the Xue family, returning to the stands with four drinks. The two girls were identical in appearance—apparently twins.

The Gao brothers naturally noticed this and grimaced. Liu Yang looked at the twin sisters on stage, then at Gao's brothers, and said awkwardly: "Ah, you two might be arranged for marriage with these two Xue family girls in the future."

He Tao was amused and laughed. Gao An hit He Tao's shoulder, but accidentally struck his injured one. He Tao inhaled sharply, his handsome face twisting into a knot.

Seeing He Tao's grimacing expression, Gao An awkwardly asked: "Sorry, sorry. I didn't mean to hit hard. Are you okay?"

This caught Su Nantian's attention. He had known these boys were fooling around behind him, but when they touched He Tao's injury, he couldn't let them continue.

Su Nantian walked over to the four of them and took He Tao's arm from Gao An's hands. The pain had made He Tao break out in cold sweat, but his frown hadn't eased.

His long fingers probed He Tao's bruised and swollen arm, and even before touching the discolored area, He Tao gasped.

Su Nantian frowned slightly and pressed lightly on the good part of his arm, causing He Tao to gasp again.

"You twisted your muscles from overexertion. It's like a cramp, spreading down the arm—don't touch it." Su Nantian didn't want to expose his magic in front of everyone, but seeing He Tao's pain, he felt some pity. So he discreetly applied a little magic to his fingertips, and a faint blue glow spread over them.

Like when he treated Song Jin before, Su Nantian used the excuse of massaging to continuously pass a weak flow of energy to He Tao, suppressing his pain.

As Su Nantian massaged, He Tao's frown finally relaxed completely. He smiled apologetically at Su Nantian: "Tian Ge, how are you so magical? Just a touch and I don't feel pain anymore."

Liu Yang teased: "Don't be silly. How can you describe Tian Ge's hands like a woman’s?" Su Nantian glanced at Liu Yang, who immediately put his index finger to his lips in a shushing gesture.

After passing a certain amount of magic to He Tao's injury, Su Nantian wiped his hands on Liu Yang's clean sports shirt, wiping away the sweat from He Tao’s arm.

Gao's brothers laughed at Liu Yang: "Look, look. This Liu family junior is like a nurse cleaning up the mess."

After some playful banter, Su Nantian had handled He Tao's arm. When the referee blew the whistle again, Su Nantian’s team appeared before everyone with a relaxed and confident demeanor.

This contrasted sharply with Qian Fachen's Class Two, as if on this small sports field, separated by a net, one was sunny and the other rainy.

This match was the last three sets, and after two points were added, it would determine the result.

The current score was 3-1, so this final three sets could either have Qian Fachen fight for two points to tie the match or let Su Nantian's Class One become a sure champion.

Qian Fachen naturally understood this, but he was different from others who would strive for those two points to tie.

Qian Fachen, who always pursued individual victory, would never accept a draw.

But helplessly, the result was only one of two possibilities—Qian Fachen had no interest in a draw. Subconsciously, the balance had already tilted toward Su Nantian's victory.

Indeed, in the final two matches, Su Nantian didn't even need to act; Gao's brothers and Liu Yang and He Tao had already secured the two points.

The final whistle blew, and the referee changed the score to 5-1. The crowd cheered.

Many students from Class One rushed onto the field, lifting their five members to cheer. Even He Tao, who was injured, seemed to forget his pain due to this victory.

While some rejoiced, others remained dark and silent.

Qian Fachen's evil gaze faded, leaving only a cold stare fixed on Su Nantian surrounded by praise.

Unable to bear this humiliation, Qian Fachen's face stiffened and he turned to leave. Li Xiao and the others followed silently.

But before Qian Fachen took a few steps, Su Nantian's voice called out: "Stop."

Qian Fachen paused and slowly lowered his steps. He turned like an eagle, staring at Su Nantian: "What else do you want?"

Su Nantian turned his neck slowly and said: "I didn't call you. You can go. Li Xiao stays."

Qian Fachen's eyes flashed with anger, his breaths in his chest chaotic. Li Xiao also looked fearfully at Su Nantian and then at Qian Fachen, fearing Qian Fachen would hand him over. After all, with the things Li Xiao had done, Su Nantian could easily break his leg.

Seeing Li Xiao's fearful expression, Su Nantian said: "What are you afraid of? I won't use the same underhanded methods as you."

"But you must admit what you did. Give him a chance to apologize."

Li Xiao tightened his lips, and after a long silence, he loosened his already pale lips and said: "Although I don't know where I was wrong, since the champion asked me to apologize..."

"Don't you know where you were wrong?" Su Nantian let out a cold laugh: "Do you think your actions went unnoticed? Your self-assessment is so smart?"

Chapter 220: Apology

Li Xiao's face paled. He naturally understood that Su Nantian was referring to his attack on Song Jin in the restroom, but there were no video recordings of any evidence. Even if Song Jin reported him, Li Xiao could easily deny it.

That was the plan Qian Fachen had made—no matter what method, he ordered Li Xiao to eliminate one of Su Nantian's team members.

Now Song Jin was in the hospital, and no one knew what Li Xiao had done. Naturally, Su Nantian's request seemed excessive and incomprehensible to others.

Gao Jingjing and Wu Lianxing had just come down from the front-row seats, and naturally, they thought of ways to support Su Nantian.

No matter what Su Nantian had done, in Gao Jingjing and Wu Lianxing's eyes, it was understandable and completely correct.

But even they didn't understand why Su Nantian had asked Qian Fachen's underling to apologize.

At this moment, Gao Jingjing softly asked: "Nantian, why did you ask Li Xiao to apologize?"

Su Nantian looked at Gao Jingjing affectionately, then composed his expression before saying: "Earlier, Qian Fachen sent Li Xiao to hide nails on our Class One's field. Fortunately, we discovered it."

"Then Qian Fachen sent Li Xiao to attack Song Jin during the break, breaking his legs and sending him to the hospital with Cao Yun."

"These things were caused by Qian Fachen," Su Nantian said coldly, looking at Li Xiao. He felt his blood flow reverse, as if thrown into a deep and freezing ice pool.

Su Nantian continued: "But the direct perpetrator was you. So why not apologize?"

After Su Nantian's explanation, everyone understood the situation anew. They looked at Qian Fachen and Li Xiao, as well as Class Two with a deep sense of contempt.

Fengyue Academy valued martial strength, but not success through underhanded means.

Even the counselor of Class Two turned red-faced. He had hoped that Qian Fachen and the instructor's actions would elevate Class Two's reputation, thus improving his position.

But even he hadn't expected such a big disaster.

"Chen Bin, you're a teacher. How can you allow your students to bully another class? Do you think it's appropriate? Do you think this is how you should raise them?" Zhu Ying shouted.

Chen Bin was the counselor of Class Two, and he and Zhu Ying were at the same level. Both had been invited to Fengyue Academy due to their excellent academic backgrounds. However, after enrollment, Zhu Ying's good looks caught the principal's attention, so he was given special care.

This made Chen Bin very annoyed and always sought an opportunity to bring down Zhu Ying and her class. So when Qian Fachen and the instructor proposed this plan, Chen Bin eagerly agreed.

To stand on stage as a winner today, Chen Bin had even spent a lot of money to buy an elegant suit.

But he hadn't expected no applause, only curses and contempt. Chen Bin was embarrassed and bowed his head to avoid the crowd's gaze, unable to respond to Zhu Ying's accusations. Suddenly, he straightened up and screamed, running out of the crowd.

The class monitor of Class Two was a relatively honest person. Seeing his counselor run away due to the pressure, he followed closely, fearing something would happen to Chen Bin.

Thus, everyone's attention returned to Li Xiao. Now that they knew the truth, instead of being confused as before, they shouted at him angrily: "Apologize!"

Li Xiao's eyes turned bloodshot and his face twisted with a sinister expression: "Why should I apologize? Why do you think it was me? If you say it was, then it was! I don't admit it!"

But now, Li Xiao's denial couldn't change the situation. Every detail of this event was noticed by all the spectators. Those who had been admitted to this university weren't fools and naturally knew whether Li Xiao was innocent or not.

The contempt in their eyes deepened, making Li Xiao feel short of breath.

Desperately, Li Xiao turned his eyes to Qian Fachen for help.

Having been accustomed to Qian Fachen's orders, Li Xiao now desperately begged him to pull him out of this mess.

But Qian Fachen didn't respond, or rather, he didn't direct his gaze at Li Xiao. Qian Fachen only looked at Su Nantian with a complex expression, his eyes filled with something strange.

Li Xiao suddenly laughed: "What if it was me? I hit him because he wasn't strong enough!" This was shouted by Li Xiao, but it was unclear whether he meant Song Jin or himself.

"If he had been lucky, he wouldn't have been beaten like this. This is all because he was too stupid! Why should I apologize? After all, I'm also a victim, right?" Li Xiao pressed his chest with force, his eyes filled with bloodshot veins as if they would burst out any second.

Since the crowd didn't know Li Xiao's background, they weren't greatly affected by his words. But Qian Fachen was drawn to Li Xiao's statement.

Qian Fachen frowned at Li Xiao but remained silent toward this helpless Li Xiao.

"I not only want you to apologize, I also want you to kneel and apologize." Su Nantian seemed cold-blooded, but Liu Yang knew he was avenging Song Jin. No matter what Li Xiao said, the real victim was Song Jin. Even without a fracture, the pain of a hairline crack wasn't something most people could endure.

The words "kneel and apologize" were like a key, igniting all the memories Li Xiao had buried deep in his heart: as a child sent to the Qian family, he was forced to kneel and apologize; when he couldn't finish his meals, he had to kneel and apologize. Later, when Qian Fachen didn't complete his lessons, Li Xiao had to kneel and apologize. When Qian Fachen didn't return home on time, Li Xiao had to kneel at the door waiting for Qian Fachen's return and greet him with "Sorry, Master, for keeping you waiting."

These memories tormented every nerve of Li Xiao. Now, Su Nantian had ignited the fuse, and Li Xiao was in unbearable pain. These memories of his own rushed through his mind.

Like being submerged underwater and barely breathing, Li Xiao gasped heavily and collapsed to the ground. His eyes were more determined than ever before as he said, one word at a time: "I... do... not... apologize."

Chapter 221: Punishment

Li Xiao's words were like a thunderclap, striking the ground. The surrounding students looked at Li Xiao as if he were a fool.

At this moment, someone from Su Nantian's side couldn't help but point at Li Xiao and shout: "Are you even a person? After doing such things, you don't take responsibility. You refuse to apologize!"

"Exactly! Do you think you did the right thing?" Liu Yang frowned and stepped forward, pulling He Tao out as well. He pointed at He Tao's bruised arm and said: "Because of saving Song Jin, He Tao's arm is like this. If it weren't for your actions, Song Jin and He Tao would be safe now!"

He Tao looked at this scoundrel with anger boiling over. He had never seen such a shameless person, one who didn't even show remorse for his mistakes.

Liu Yang's chest rose and fell heavily, his fists clenched tightly. He longed to beat him up until he admitted guilt.

Liu Yang surveyed the crowd and pointed at Li Xiao, who was sprawled on the ground: "Look at these new students. You'll be spending four years together in this school, but you attacked a classmate who had no ill will toward you on the first day!"

"First day! He's already in the hospital!" Liu Yang emotionally scolded Li Xiao.

The students around were moved by Liu Yang's words, especially those from Class One. Thinking of Song Jin, the small and weak boy who had joined the match for his class, only to be attacked by them.

The students of Class One looked at Li Xiao with hatred so intense they wanted to tear him apart.

At this moment, Li Xiao looked up at the people pointing fingers at him and saw a scene similar to when he was beaten in the Qian family.

The same look of hatred, the same mocking and scolding.

Li Xiao could no longer bear this pressure; the fire in his heart seemed to have burned him through.

Li Xiao slowly pushed himself up from the sand with both hands, his arms exerting force as he stood up unsteadily.

"I said..." Li Xiao looked at Su Nantian with eyes like a caged beast and shouted: "I said I won't apologize!"

With a roar, Li Xiao rushed toward Su Nantian with his fists. Though unsteady and clumsy, the fire of anger in Li Xiao's heart burned endlessly like gasoline.

Su Nantian quickly shielded Gao Jingjing and Wu Lianxing behind him. Though Li Xiao's clumsy moves could never harm Su Nantian, Gao Jingjing and Wu Lianxing instinctively clung to Su Nantian's clothes.

After the match, Su Nantian smelled a particularly pleasant male pheromone. Wu Lianxing and Gao Jingjing both blushed, not daring to look at each other but unconsciously inhaling more of Su Nantian's scent.

But Li Xiao was restrained by Qian Fachen.

Something unexpected happened, and everyone was shocked, watching Qian Fachen in confusion, not knowing what he was doing. Hadn't they already given up on this guy?

Qian Fachen now tightly gripped Li Xiao's fist. As he was stronger than Li Xiao, it was easy for him to pull Li Xiao back two steps.

Li Xiao's eyes burned with fury, but in an instant, he calmed down. He had watched Li Xiao's outbursts from behind.

Although Li Xiao was a plaything sent by a small family, he still had to show his master's face in front of others.

"What are you doing?" Su Nantian asked Qian Fachen: "I haven't confronted you yet, but you've already come out."

The only advantage Qian Fachen had was that his ambition came and disappeared quickly.

After Su Nantian asked this, Qian Fachen quickly thought through it and said: "Li Xiao was with me since childhood. We've gone through a lot..."

"Hah, you went through a lot with him. How many evil things has he done for you?" Liu Yang interjected.

Facing Su Nantian, Qian Fachen couldn't show his strength, but that didn't mean he could hold back his humiliation when facing Liu Yang.

At this moment, Qian Fachen's dangerous gaze made Liu Yang stiffen. Qian Fachen didn't answer Liu Yang's question, and Liu Yang was inexperienced enough to be scared.

Seeing that Liu Yang didn't interfere, Qian Fachen continued: "Most of what Li Xiao did today is related to me. Now he's been stimulated, and I can't abandon him."

A wave of shock spread through the crowd. What kind of person was Qian Fachen? Even though it had been a short time since enrollment, his character had already been exposed during the match.

Now Qian Fachen's words were unlike anything he could have said during the match!

Qian Fachen didn't care about the crowd's shock or Li Xiao's gaze. He continued: "After doing so many wrong things, apologizing is deserved. Therefore, I'm here to sincerely apologize and have caused you a lot of trouble."

Qian Fachen extended his hand, and as he said this, he bowed. He looked like a well-mannered young master.

This wasn't enough. Qian Fachen continued: "Today, I'm showing Su Nantian my submission. After all, we are classmates at the same school. We'll be spending university years together. I hope this match in our hearts is just a friendly exchange. Thank you, everyone."
