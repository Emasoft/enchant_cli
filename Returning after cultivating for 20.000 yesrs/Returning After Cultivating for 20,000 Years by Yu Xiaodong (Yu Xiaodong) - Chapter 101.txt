“Brother, don’t blame us. This matter is of utmost importance to the Huang family. If you were to inform the Nanong family about this, our entire clan might face annihilation. Under these circumstances, we had no choice but to act against you. You know that the Huang family has always relied on the Nanong family’s protection; they control our lifeline. If the Nanong family discovered that we had sent someone to injure Nanong Ping, our clan would likely vanish without a trace.”

Sü Nan Tian observed Huang Zhizhong’s demeanor and felt he was not lying. Moreover, based on the information Sü Nan Tian had previously gathered, the Nanong family’s control over the Huang clan was indeed formidable.

Even before, when Nanong Yuyan had been conversing with Nanong Ping, the Nanong family had already begun preparing for potential rebellion from the Huang clan. Thus, the current living conditions of the Huang family were far from tranquil as outsiders assumed.

Many believed that the Huang clan thrived by relying on a powerful patron, benefiting from the Nanong family’s protection while developing their own势力 without drawing attention. Yet they failed to realize that before expanding, the Huang clan had to obtain the Nanong family’s approval.

Sü Nan Tian nodded but did not remove the gun from Huang Zhiwei’s head. “Then tell me, why did you send people to our room? And I noticed your initial intent wasn’t merely to harm Nanong Ping.”

Sü Nan Tian had always been curious about this matter. When he first stepped out of the study and saw those individuals searching for something, he now seized the opportunity to clarify.

Upon hearing this question, Huang Zhizhong nodded and said, “Indeed, we were searching for something. Our original intention wasn’t to harm Nanong Ping; however, during our escape, we had no choice but to injure him. Upon returning, they informed us of this incident, and we were equally astonished—it was as if they had driven us to desperation.”

At this point, Huang Zhizhong looked regretful. If their people had escaped without harming Nanong Ping, this situation would not have escalated so severely. However, now the Wu family had blocked all their escape routes, and hiding here was already a source of anxiety.

Sü Nan Tian glanced around the room, noticing several bodyguards whose faces bore signs of simple makeup-based disguises. Though these disguises could deceive an untrained eye, a thorough inspection would immediately reveal their artificiality.

“Then what exactly were you searching for? Why was it so crucial that Nanong Ping carried it here?” Sü Nan Tian asked, puzzled. He had no idea what the Huang family sought.

Indeed, this time Sü Nan Tian accompanied Nanong Ping, and Nanong Ping had not brought any critical items. Before arriving, he had mentioned this was the Wu family’s territory and that no confidential materials from the Nanong clan could be brought along. Any items he usually carried were locked in a safe and entrusted to Nanong Lin.

Thus, Sü Nan Tian was genuinely perplexed—what exactly did the Huang family seek?

“Today, the Wu family sent invitations to all major clans. You know this, right?” Huang Zhizhong suddenly asked.

Sü Nan Tian nodded. “Of course I do. The invitation from the Nanong family was delivered to me by the young master.”

“Then you didn’t notice anything unusual about this invitation?” Huang Zhizhong asked again.

Sü Nan Tian shook his head. He hadn’t scrutinized the invitation closely, merely glanced at its wording before passing it to Nanong Ping. And Nanong Ping hadn’t mentioned any unique aspects of the request.

Huang Zhizhong realized Sü Nan Tian had missed the detail and said, “This invitation isn’t just for tonight’s banquet. Each family received only one. That means even if the Nanong clan sent both Nanong Ping and Nanong Yuyan, there was only one invitation. This is the voting slip. There’s also a section on the back where you can write down the name of the person you wish to vote for.”

Upon hearing this, Sü Nan Tian understood—this was clearly the voting slip they had come to retrieve.

“But why would you need just one voting slip? Won’t the Nanong family ask the Wu family for another if they discover it’s missing?” Sü Nan Tian was still confused. He found it odd that the Huang family would risk everything for a single voting slip, as even if they lost it, Nanong Xia could claim it was misplaced.

“This shows you don’t understand the voting process or the rules governing how our major clans cast their votes,” Huang Zhizhong said, pacing the living room. “There are only a few voting slips—excluding the Wu family, only the Nanong, Wang, Huang, and Song clans remain. Thus, only four voting slips were printed, none extra. Moreover, each voting slip has anti-counterfeiting measures and can be identified without a signature, revealing whose it is. Each family’s voting slip bears an invisible mark representing their clan. Even if the slip was lost, once it reached the ballot box, it would represent the family’s choice.”

Upon hearing this, Sü Nan Tian was still puzzled. “In that case, wouldn’t it be easy for someone to seize the voting slip?”

Huang Zhizhong nodded. “For centuries, these major clans have been entangled in conflicts. There were even several changes of family leadership. However, nowadays, people avoid open violence and instead use interests to negotiate. But before that, this rule was always in place. Some people would even resort to violence for the voting slips. This rule is also universally accepted.”

Upon hearing this, Sü Nan Tian was still baffled by these major clans’ entanglements. He also felt the danger of such family rivalries at this moment.

Chapter 497: Astonishing

Sü Nan Tian suddenly realized the competition among these major clans was far more brutal than he had imagined.

“So you wanted to steal this voting slip and have the Nanong clan cast their vote through it? But then, since your family’s vote would align with the Nanong clan’s, wouldn’t that expose your theft of the voting slip?” Sü Nan Tian pondered, still confused.

“Everyone knows we’ve always followed the Nanong clan’s votes. Thus, the result of their vote would inevitably match ours. We only care about the outcome; even if the Nanong clan asked, we would say we voted in line with theirs,” Huang Zhizhong said.

“Clearly, someone offered you a substantial benefit. Otherwise, your clan wouldn’t have dared to oppose the Nanong family. Who is this person with such influence? It’s unlikely to be Wu Chuan, since the conditions he offered to the Nanong clan would naturally be shared with you. There must be another influential figure.”

Sü Nan Tian said this with a smile, convinced that someone else had offered more enticing terms, prompting the Huang clan to take such a risk.

“Exactly,” Huang Zhizhong agreed. “Someone did offer us better terms, and for our clan, these terms were more tempting. That’s why we chose this method.”

At this point, Sü Nan Tian was curious about who else could have offered the Huang clan such tempting conditions besides Wu Chuan.

Sü Nan Tian thought through the remaining people and believed only Wu Yu could have done this. Only Wu Yu appeared to harbor grand ambitions and possessed genuine talent.

“May I ask who this person is? And what tempting conditions did they offer that made your clan take such a risk?” Sü Nan Tian asked with a smile, determined to uncover all he could during this opportunity.

After all, the information宋 Liichen had given Sü Nan Tian was limited; many details were omitted, and some matters weren’t elaborated. This was because certain aspects involved the Song clan, necessitating discretion.

Now that Huang Zhiwei was in Sü Nan Tian’s grip and the latter showed clear interest in this topic, Huang Zhizhong knew there was no point in concealing anything further.

Moreover, if he lied and Sü Nan Tian discovered it, Huang Zhiwei’s safety would be in jeopardy.

Huang Zhizhong nodded and said, “I can tell you, but please keep it secret for the Huang clan.”

“Whether I keep it secret depends on what conditions you propose. You can choose whether to tell me now, but if you don’t, I might get angry and your brother’s head would explode.” Sü Nan Tian showed no interest in Huang Zhizhong’s trivial demands. The more he agreed to such conditions, the more the other party would push for further concessions.

Huang Zhizhong now realized the small bodyguard before him was truly unapproachable, impervious to both flattery and threats.

Thus, Huang Zhizhong could only reluctantly say, “I’ll try to meet your demands. However, I hope that after we reach an agreement, whatever I said here remains buried in your stomach. Especially don’t let the Nanong clan know.”

“I’ll try,” Sü Nan Tian replied, still nonchalant.

Huang Zhizhong sighed and said, “The one who negotiated with us was Wu Ruotian.”

“What? Upon hearing the name Wu Ruotian, Sü Nan Tian almost choked. This Wu Ruotian had promised to submit the Wu clan to the Nanong clan upon becoming its patriarch, yet he had tricked the Huang clan into doing this. This was utterly unbelievable to Sü Nan Tian.

Now, Sü Nan Tian had to reconsider: was Wu Zetian’s intelligence low, or was the Huang clan’s?

However, Sü Nan Tian only showed a brief surprise and didn’t let his emotions surface clearly.

Thus, he continued asking, “May I know what Wu Ruotian exactly offered you? This person had previously appeared weak. Choosing such a partner seems quite peculiar.”

“Some people appear to be wise but are actually foolish; their surface behavior may hide their sharpness. Wu Ruotian promised that if he became the Wu clan’s patriarch, after seizing power, he would help our Huang clan break free from the Nanong clan,” Huang Zhizhong said.

Upon hearing this, Sü Nan Tian smiled. “You’re still lying to me. If it were just an empty promise, I don’t think your Huang clan would be so foolish. Even if he took control of the Wu clan, do you think your two sides’ hidden forces could rival the Nanong clan? He must have proposed specific conditions to entice you. If it were just this, your clan wouldn’t have agreed.”

Upon hearing these words, Huang Zhizhong inhaled sharply. He hadn’t expected this small bodyguard to be so astute.

Indeed, he had not revealed everything, only a vague and grand promise. Initially, when Wu Ruotian approached them, he had spoken similarly. However, after some discussion, they discovered Wu Ruotian actually possessed something.

Seeing Huang Zhizhong hesitate, Sü Nan Tian pressed the gun against Huang Zhiwei’s head again.

“I don’t have patience anymore, and soon the Wu clan people might arrive. At that time, I’ll only be able to arrest you as loyal servants of the Nanong clan.”

Seeing this, Huang Zhizhong quickly said, “I’ll tell you. Don’t be reckless. The Wu clan’s branch recently discovered an oil field unknown to anyone, and they plan to secretly exploit it. However, this news hasn’t been reported to the Wu clan’s main branch and they don’t intend to inform their superiors. They plan to keep it for themselves. He promised me that if I helped him seize the patriarch position, this oil field would be directly split with us. Do you know what this means?”

Upon hearing Huang Zhizhong’s words, Sü Nan Tian was stunned. This was indeed astonishing.

Chapter 498: Disguise

Upon hearing Huang Zhizhong’s words, Sü Nan Tian was extremely shocked. What did an oil field represent? There was no need for anyone to explain it; Sü Nan Tian already knew its precious value.

At the same time, he was amazed by Wu Ruotian’s hidden depth. This person had seemingly approached the Nanong clan, yet he used a condition that appeared unachievable to promise, but in reality, he had his own hidden actions.

Thinking about this, Sü Nan Tian was startled because he had previously encountered this person when seeking Wu Youer. At that time, the man had appeared extremely foolish, but now it seemed he had been deceiving Sü Nan Tian.

“Unexpectedly, this person was a hidden黑马,” Sü Nan Tian smiled and said. “However, an oil field—without truly seeing it, would you believe his words?”

Sü Nan Tian continued asking because such conditions were too tempting. If it was a trap, the consequences would be disastrous.

“He showed us some documents; they were very specific and definitely not fabricated. Moreover, there were photos taken by their people, all proving the oil field was real.”

At this point, Huang Zhizhong took two steps back and retrieved his tablet from the briefcase on the table.

Huang Zhizhong unlocked the tablet’s screen and found the files Wu Ruotian had given him about the oil field in an encrypted folder.

Without hesitation, Huang Zhizhong placed it before Sü Nan Tian and said, “If you’re interested, take a look.”

Sü Nan Tian noticed Huang Zhizhong’s eagerness and knew he was trying to persuade him to join, then let go of Huang Zhiwei and keep the secret.

“You’re trying to bribe me, but I have no interest in this. Or rather, I have no interest in money,” Sü Nan Tian smiled.

Sü Nan Tian didn’t know his exact assets, but he had no interest in money now. Money was now a mere external thing.

His only goal was to save Wu Youer and Wu Tao’s couple.

Huang Zhizhong hadn’t expected this move to fail. He had thought Sü Nan Tian would be interested in the oil field, but now it seemed this man was truly impervious to flattery and had no desire for money.

Huang Zhizhong could only let out a laugh and said, “Tell me what you need directly. What I can offer is only these. Other things, if you don’t tell me, I definitely can’t promise you.”

Huang Zhizhong sat beside Sü Nan Tian and stared at him, his expression quite sincere.

Sü Nan Tian smiled and replied, “I do have something I want, but I haven’t decided yet. So long as you promise to help me when I need it, that’s fine.”

“This… isn’t it a bit demanding? You’re not directly stating your conditions but asking us to give you an empty promise. If you later ask for unreasonable demands, we’ll have to comply, and our Huang clan would be drained.”

Huang Zhizhong looked troubled. Obviously, he didn’t want to agree to Sü Nan Tian’s request.

Sü Nan Tian waved his hand and said, “Ah, I wouldn’t ask you to do anything excessive. Moreover, I have no interest in money, so you can rest assured that I won’t ask for anything unreasonable. Just two days later, I may have a small plan and need your help to provide convenience. Of course, I won’t involve you in it. You can rest assured.”

Huang Zhizhong heard this but still looked troubled. If he agreed to this empty promise, it would be opened. However, if he didn’t agree and the Wu clan people arrived, their entire plan would be exposed.

Huang Zhizhong no longer worried about Huang Zhiwei’s safety because Sü Nan Tian had the gun pressed against his head, and he clearly didn’t intend to kill him. In fact, if Sü Nan Tian killed him, the situation would become even more complicated.

“Then, if you don’t agree, I’ll have no choice but to expose your situation from the Nanong clan’s perspective. You know what the consequences are,” Sü Nan Tian said without urgency, knowing Huang Zhizhong would eventually agree.

Moreover, Sü Nan Tian hadn’t intended to take gold. He truly couldn’t think of what the Huang clan should do for him now. He just wanted to accumulate a contact, which he could use later when rescuing Wu Tao’s couple and Wu Youer.

Huang Zhizhong finally nodded and said, “Alright, then I agree.”

But unexpectedly, Huang Zhiwei suddenly said, “Big brother, if you agree with him now, what if he asks us to do something we can’t? You shouldn’t be so hasty in agreeing. This is an empty promise. If you agree, he might take advantage of it.”

Sü Nan Tian hadn’t expected Huang Zhiwei to still resist while his gun was pressed against his head.

Sü Nan Tian smiled and said, “Don’t worry. I can assure you that whatever I ask of you won’t exceed your abilities. Moreover, it won’t involve your Huang clan. Also, I won’t ask you to pay money. I just hope you can help me.”

“Okay, I agree. But now these people are all disguised. If you can easily spot them, then the Wu clan might also easily spot them. You should help us pass through the Wu clan’s inspection and let us leave safely.”

Sü Nan Tian hadn’t expected Huang Zhizhong to propose such a condition. He hadn’t even asked for anything yet, but Huang Zhizhong was asking him to help them hide.

However, Sü Nan Tian smiled and said, “Okay. This is simple. Just provide me with what I need, and I can make them completely unrecognizable. This is far better than your crude disguises.”

“Really? Then tell me what you need immediately, so I can prepare it before the Wu clan people arrive.” Huang Zhizhong’s face lit up with joy.

Thus, Sü Nan Tian listed a few things he needed. Wang Zhizhong immediately sent someone to prepare them. The items Sü Nan Tian mentioned weren’t complicated and could be found immediately. Since they could use those things for disguising, adding a few more would be what Sü Nan Tian needed.

Chapter 499: Safe Passage

Huang Zhizhong, fearing the Wu clan would descend, quickly had the items Sü Nan Tian needed prepared within minutes.

“How about it? Does this match what you wanted?” Huang Zhizhong asked carefully.

Sü Nan Tian nodded and said, “It’s enough. Call those four people over.”

After saying this, Sü Nan Tian no longer pressed Huang Zhiwei’s neck and directly put the gun back into his waistband, then released Huang Zhiwei.

Huang Zhiwei had been pressed against the sofa by Sü Nan Tian’s grip, feeling extremely uncomfortable. Now that he was released, he immediately stretched his body.

Meanwhile, Sü Nan Tian took the items they had given him and started disguising the others.

Sü Nan Tian’s current disguise was completely different from his own. His own disguise transformed him into another person, and this lasted for a long time.

Sü Nan Tian’s current disguise had already maintained for nearly a week. However, the one he was currently using on them was temporary; if someone used special makeup remover, they could wipe off all the disguises.

But since the Huang clan people would leave after tonight’s banquet, as long as they survived the next inspection, there would be no problem.

Watching Sü Nan Tian carefully disguising these people, Huang Zhiwei quietly approached Huang Zhizhong and signaled him with a glance, indicating whether they should kill Sü Nan Tian now.

But Huang Zhizhong shook his head to signal Huang Zhiwei to stay calm. He had noticed this person had some talent and that he wasn’t entirely loyal to the Nanong clan, but rather had his own goals.

Thus, Huang Zhizhong no longer worried about his secrets being exposed because he had already agreed to help Sü Nan Tian, and now Sü Nan Tian was using the pigments to disguise his people. Therefore, both sides were essentially cooperating.

At this moment, although Sü Nan Tian was disguising these people, he also knew Huang Zhiwei and Huang Zhizhong might have some tricks. However, he had no worries because, whether in terms of combat skills or current status, he was definitely not the passive party.

Because Sü Nan Tian’s disguises for these people weren’t like his own, which lasted a long time. It was quick to achieve the effect he wanted. The four people took less than half an hour in total.

“Alright, look at it. Is this much better than yours?” Sü Nan Tian put down the items and instructed Huang Zhizhong to have someone dispose of them.

Huang Zhizhong and Huang Zhiwei looked at the people Sü Nan Tian had disguised and were both stunned. If they hadn’t known these people were disguised, they wouldn’t have recognized them now.

Because they had completely transformed into another appearance and looked very natural. Even with such close observation, no flaws could be found. Unlike their own previous disguises, which would reveal abnormalities when observed closely.

“This is truly amazing. I never thought you had this talent,” Huang Zhizhong clapped his hands and said.

Huang Zhiwei also applauded alongside Huang Zhizhong, both satisfied with the effect.

“Alright, now just make sure these people act naturally. Don’t be too nervous when others check them; there’ll be no flaws.”

Upon hearing this, Huang Zhizhong and Huang Zhiwei nodded immediately. They hadn’t expected someone to voluntarily help them hide their people. However, the cost of this assistance was quite high because they still didn’t know what this person needed from them.

Yet at that moment, footsteps were heard outside, and the number of people was considerable.

“It must be Wu Chuan’s group. Don’t let your guard down, and don’t relax. No one will notice you.” Sü Nan Tian patted the shoulders of these people and said.

At this moment, the door was knocked on. A voice from outside called out, “Master Huang, please open the door. We’re conducting a routine inspection.”

Huang Zhizhong and Huang Zhiwei looked around the room, finding no other flaws. They immediately nodded to one of them to open the door.

When this person opened the door, Wu Chuan and his group immediately entered. Upon seeing Sü Nan Tian, Wu Chuan smiled and said, “Young man, did you find anything?”

Sü Nan Tian shook his head. “Nothing found. There’s no suspicious place at all.”

“Indeed, the Huang clan wouldn’t send people to harm Master Nanong. Still, we need to conduct a routine inspection. Please check again for any suspicious places.” Wu Chuan said, indicating his bodyguards to continue searching.

Thus, Wu Chuan’s group continued to search the Huang clan’s room. However, they couldn’t find anything because these murderers were standing before them, yet they failed to notice due to their faces being altered by Sü Nan Tian.

However, at this moment, Wu Chuan waited in the room and approached one of them, saying, “Hey, this young man looks unfamiliar. I don’t think I’ve seen you with the Huang clan before.”

This person, who had also injured Nanong Ping, was extremely nervous. Especially since this face hadn’t appeared before, so it was normal for the face to look unfamiliar.

This person almost trembled upon Wu Chuan’s question. However, at this moment, Huang Zhizhong quickly said, “There are so many people coming to my house today. Mr. Wu, you couldn’t have met everyone. It’s natural for this child to be unfamiliar with you. It’s his luck that he could have a conversation with you.”

Huang Zhizhong said this while patting Wu Chuan’s back, which made Wu Chuan very pleased.

However, at this moment, those who had searched the Huang clan’s room also came out and told Wu Chuan, “Master, we’ve checked everywhere. There are no abnormalities. No one found the person who harmed Master Nanong.”

Chapter 500: Nothing Found

“I knew it would be this result. It’s just a routine inspection. The Huang clan wouldn’t send people to harm Master Nanong. Alright, since this is the case, we’ll leave now. Everyone should stay in their rooms and come out when the banquet starts to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings. Also, for everyone’s safety, we’ll increase our security personnel. I’ll take my leave now.”

Wu Chuan said this while smiling at Huang Zhizhong and Huang Zhiwei, then led the group away.

Sü Nan Tian nodded at Huang Zhizhong and Huang Zhiwei, then followed the group out. After all, he had come with Wu Chuan’s group and naturally needed to return to report to Nanong Yuyan.

“What’s going on? We’ve searched the entire estate and still couldn’t find those people. How could they fly away?” After leaving the Huang clan’s room, Wu Chuan was extremely angry. Up to now, his people had thoroughly searched the entire estate.

But now they found nothing, and with time until the banquet approaching rapidly, if they still couldn’t find people, Nanong Yuyan might truly vote for someone else as she said.

Even though Wu Chuan had already reached an agreement with the Wang clan, he still wanted to obtain Nanong’s vote.

Although the Wang clan’s steward had told him that this time, they would support him together with the Song clan, compared to the iron alliance of the Nanong and Huang clans, this cooperation between these two families was hard to believe.

At this moment, Wu Chuan dispersed all his subordinates to continue searching the estate and recheck every place within the Wu clan’s range.

Wu Chuan then returned to the infirmary with Sü Nan Tian, preparing to inform Nanong Yuyan of their first search results. After all, dragging it out was no good; they had to inform them of the situation, and this would allow Wu Chuan to continue discussing with Nanong Yuyan.

Nanong Yuyan was still standing outside the operating room, while Nanong Ping was still being examined in the medical room. He hadn’t woken up yet, but the CT scan showed no serious issues with his brain. However, not waking up was indeed a problem.

Nanong Yuyan turned around and saw Wu Chuan coming with Sü Nan Tian. She immediately said to Wu Chuan, “Uncle Wu, I hope you’ve brought good news.”

Wu Chuan could only sigh and rub his hands. “Good news will definitely come, but not now.”

Nanong Yuyan looked at Sü Nan Tian and nodded for him to speak.

“Miss, we’ve already searched every room in the estate with all of Wu’s bodyguards. There were no abnormalities, and we found no suspicious places or the person who harmed Master Nanong,” Sü Nan Tian said. Then he pushed Wu Chuan aside and stood behind Nanong Yuyan, clearly emphasizing his position. Although he had accompanied Wu Chuan for the inspection, he hadn’t forgotten that he was part of the Nanong clan.

“Uncle Wu, you know now there are only a few hours until the banquet. If you still can’t find the culprits, don’t blame us for being unkind,” Nanong Yuyan said with a smile. Though her face showed a smile, her words were cold.

“Right now, we’re increasing our manpower to search further. Give me some time and I’ll definitely give you a satisfactory answer. Master Nanong was harmed, and I’m also shocked. Since this happened on our Wu clan’s territory, I’ll definitely do my best to catch the culprits,” Wu Chuan said with a sincere expression and tone.

“Uncle Wu, you know that once the banquet starts, we’ll never find this culprit. After the banquet ends, all major clans will leave. You can’t keep people detained in the Wu clan. Then, who harmed Master Nanong? We’ll never solve this case.”

Nanong Yuyan continued speaking, pressuring Wu Chuan. In fact, Nanong Yuyan had some suspicions that these culprits were now hidden in a very concealed place, even Wu Chuan couldn’t find them.

But the fact that their clan’s person was harmed could not be ignored. If this matter passed without resolution, their family’s dignity would be completely lost.

Moreover, it wasn’t just a minor member of the Nanong clan who was harmed; it was their young master, Nanong Ping. Everyone would mock the Nanong clan for this.

“Rest assured, I’ll personally supervise them to find it. I’ll definitely give you a satisfactory answer,” Wu Chuan said and then left, clearly intending to supervise as he had said.

After seeing Wu Chuan leave, Sü Nan Tian cleared his throat and approached Nanong Yuyan, saying, “Wu Chuan now has a second plan. He’s already contacted the Wang clan.”

Upon hearing this, Nanong Yuyan immediately said, “Tell me everything you know.”

“I was with Wu Chuan’s group during the inspection. When we arrived at the Wang clan’s room, the Wang clan’s steward had already come. They also brought a large number of bodyguards. And this person directly asked to talk with Wu Chuan about the voting matter. However, I don’t know what they specifically discussed because at that time, I was sent to check the Huang clan’s room.”

Sü Nan Tian recounted everything he had learned. For him, the more chaotic the relationships among the major clans were, the better, as it would allow him to take advantage of the chaos to rescue Wu Tao’s couple and Wu Youer.

“Hmph, I knew the Wang clan wouldn’t give up so easily. They must have already known Wu Chuan’s conditions to do this. I think the Wang clan has definitely allied with the Song clan; otherwise, where would they get the confidence to propose conditions to Wu Chuan? After all, one clan has only one vote. But if the Nanong clan votes, there’s also the Huang clan behind it.”

Nanong Yuyan looked calm and didn’t seem surprised. Her mind was extremely clear, and she quickly analyzed the current situation.

Because only in this way could Wu Chuan achieve his desired outcome.

Chapter 501: Condemnation

Seeing Nanong Yuyan’s reaction, Sü Nan Tian was also impressed. He hadn’t expected her to react so calmly in this situation and quickly analyze the current circumstances.

“Then, Miss, what should we do now? If it’s indeed as you said and they can’t find the culprits, we won’t cooperate with them. Then all the benefits will go to others. Will the dock’s share not be ours?”

Sü Nan Tian was very concerned about this point because only through cooperation with the Nanong clan and Hu clan could he have more opportunities to approach the Wu clan, thereby creating more chances to resolve Wu Tao’s couple and Wu Youer.

Thus, when Nanong Yuyan said that if Wu Chuan couldn’t find the person who harmed Nanong Ping, they wouldn’t cooperate with the Wu clan, Sü Nan Tian’s heart was bleeding.

Nanong Yuyan waved her hand and said, “I’ve already considered this. Not only was Master Nanong harmed, but we couldn’t have nothing and be taken advantage of by others. I’ll definitely make Wu Chuan cooperate with us as he previously said, and even get more benefits from him.”

Sü Nan Tian observed Nanong Yuyan’s confident expression and was curious about how she would proceed. However, he could also guess that there were some things he didn’t understand, which only the major clans could comprehend.

At this moment, a doctor came out of the infirmary and said to Nanong Yuyan, “We’ve fully examined him. His health has no issues except for the head injury.”

Upon hearing this, Nanong Yuyan felt relieved. However, she immediately asked, “Then why hasn’t my brother woken up yet? Did this impact cause such a big effect on him? Since you said he was fine, shouldn’t he have woken up by now?”
