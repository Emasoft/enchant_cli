“Hmm, I understand. Thank you.” At this moment, Yue Xiaoshan's eyes were reddened, on the verge of tears.

For years, she had been the eldest daughter of the Yue family, accustomed to having everything she desired. Yue Han had always been her most steadfast protector, supporting the entire family.

Now that Yue Han had suddenly collapsed, all the burdens of the household fell upon her shoulders. Coupled with a series of chaotic events, she was exhausted both mentally and physically. It was rare for Su Nantian to offer his help, so she felt deeply moved.

“You don’t need to mention it. We’re all friends,” Su Nantian waved his hand casually, indicating he had already considered Yue Xiaoshan as a friend. As he was about to offer further comfort, Yuesai suddenly entered the hall from outside, his face ashen and grim.

“Uncle Hai, what’s wrong with you?” Seeing Yuesai's expression, Yue Xiaoshan instinctively asked.

Yue Hai had served the Yue family for most of his life. He had raised Yue Xiaoshan since childhood, not blood relatives but closer than family. Moreover, he was someone who couldn’t keep secrets; any slight disturbance would show on his face. With Yue Xiaoshan’s sharp eyes and quick wit, it was easy for her to notice.

“Miss Yue, we’ve received news from various places. Second Uncle, Third Uncle, and Fifth Uncle are on their way to Jiangcheng,” Yue Hai whispered, revealing three names. Those who were addressed as "Uncle" held significant status within the Yue family, being brothers of Yue Han and uncles to Yue Xiaoshan.

“Oh, why are Second Uncle and the others coming?” Upon hearing this, Yue Xiaoshan was taken aback. “Aren’t they managing branch offices in other regions? Why would they suddenly return so collectively?”

The Yue family was a typical traditional family-run company. Yue Han had separated from the clan to establish New Yue Technology Group, following a similar operational model. The majority of the group’s power was held by family members.

The three individuals Yue Hai had mentioned were all Yue Han’s cousins. According to age, Second Uncle Yuelin led the group. They managed branch offices of New Yue Group in different regions. It was unexpected that they had all decided to return at the same time, an event worth careful consideration.

Chapter 302: Remaining Calm and Observant

Having learned alongside Yue Han for so long, Yue Xiaoshan was certainly no naive heiress. She immediately realized the severity of the situation.

It was possible that Second Uncle and the others had come to Jiangcheng with the intention of taking advantage of the chaos, attempting a coup during Yue Han’s unconsciousness to wrest control of the group from her.

Delving deeper, it was possible that Yue Han’s poisoning had some connection with them. Previously, they hadn’t stopped sending various expensive medicinal herbs and tonics to Yue Han.

Some of these items were indeed beneficial for health, which Yue Xiaoshan had continued to administer. Thus, the accumulated ice-vein cold poison within Yue Han could be explained. One must always guard against internal threats, as the knife from those closest was impossible to prevent.

This matter was a private affair of the Yue family, so Su Nantian didn’t want to interfere. Fortunately, Yue Xiaoshan knew how to handle it. She immediately said, “Uncle Hai, continue monitoring them without revealing our presence. Observe their actions and we’ll retaliate accordingly.”

“Yes, Miss Yue,” Yue Hai replied.

Yue Hai was well aware that the current situation in the Yue family was precarious, and it wasn’t advisable to confront them openly. Yue Xiaoshan’s approach was wise; even if they had to act, it was essential to seize the initiative and avoid giving others an excuse, preventing those without ill intentions from feeling threatened.

After a long night, as the time approached midnight eleven o’clock, Yue Xiaoshan could no longer hold herself up. Her eyes were drooping with exhaustion.

“Nantian, I’ll go to sleep now. You should rest too; we have to go to the company tomorrow.”

Yue Xiaoshan greeted Su Nantian and, without waiting for a response, quickly left the room. Su Nantian sighed and smiled wryly before slowly returning to his room for rest.

After a brief wash, Su Nantian lay in bed and began contemplating subsequent plans with his eyes half-closed.

“Those assassins are all hardened individuals; finding a breakthrough from them is difficult. However, the ones who had voluntarily stepped forward within the Yue family were likely not strong-willed individuals. It might be worth trying to target them and obtain some valuable clues.”

The more he thought about it, the more convinced he became of this plan. After confirming his next move, he fell into a deep sleep. Tomorrow, he would have to accompany Yue Xiaoshan to New Yue Group.

The sudden misfortune of the Yue family would likely not bring peace within the group. It was up to Yue Xiaoshan to see what methods she had to suppress it.

At six o’clock the next morning, Su Nantian got up and washed. He walked to the front yard of the villa and practiced a set of martial arts, loosening his muscles. This was a habit he had maintained for years.

When he finished practicing and returned to the villa’s main hall, he found Yue Xiaoshan already up, sitting at the table having breakfast. He smiled and greeted her: “Xiaoshan, good morning.”

“Good morning. Come have breakfast,” Yue Xiaoshan pointed to the seat across from her, and Su Nantian casually sat down.

The household staff immediately brought another set of breakfast: a bowl of five-grain porridge, four small dishes of snacks and four side dishes. The life of a wealthy family was indeed refined.

Five minutes later, Su Nantian had cleared all the bowls and dishes before him. Yue Xiaoshan was stunned, asking in surprise: “Nantian, did you not eat for three days? Why are you eating so fast? Don’t you fear choking?”

“Ha, it’s fine. My digestion is quite strong; whatever I eat disappears quickly without choking.”

Su Nantian deflected the question with a casual answer. Yue Xiaoshan shook her head and continued eating.

Time passed quickly, and by seven o’clock in the morning, Yue Xiaoshan finally finished her breakfast at a leisurely pace. She picked up the small bag beside her and said to Su Nantian: “Let’s go.”

“Ah, okay.”

Su Nantian put down the newspaper he was reading and followed her closely. They arrived at the underground parking lot in front of the villa.

The space was large, housing dozens of cars. There were expensive limited edition sports cars and performance-oriented business vehicles; none of the cars were priced below a million.

Yue Xiaoshan pointed to the red sports car on the far left and said: “I usually drive this one to work. Can you drive?”

“Porsche Red Phantom, if I’m not mistaken, this car is worth around four million and it’s a limited edition. Most people would find it hard to afford.”

Su Nantian immediately recognized the model and price of the red sports car. He smiled and replied: “I can drive this kind of sports car, but now the situation is different. Driving this one would be too noticeable and could draw attention, which isn’t safe. I think the black business car next to it is more reliable.”

“That’s a car my father really likes. It was a gift from one of his friends, and it has been specially modified for performance. I see your eyes are sharp; good, let’s take that one. Let’s go, the keys are on the car.”

Yue Xiaoshan wasn’t foolish; she understood that Su Nantian’s choice was for her benefit. She didn’t argue and nodded in agreement.

After all, her father was still lying in the high-temperature room. No one was currently using this car, so it was fine for Su Nantian to practice driving.

As a part-time bodyguard of Yue Xiaoshan, Su Nantian had his position well understood. He first ran over to open the back door for Yue Xiaoshan, letting her sit down before closing the door and then sitting in the driver’s seat. He fastened his seatbelt, started the engine, and the entire process was seamless as if he had practiced it countless times.

As the car slowly pulled out of the villa’s gate, Yue Xiaoshan finally asked: “Nantian, you don’t look old, yet your skills in opening the car door are so skilled. Did you used to be a driver?”

“Hmm, sort of.”

Su Nantian nodded casually. With his strong learning ability, he could master anything quickly. Once he had seen something, it was as if he had done it before.

He seemed to not want to dwell on this topic further and subtly changed the subject: “Xiaoshan, after last night’s commotion, I think the senior management of the entire company must have heard some news. Since your Second Uncle and others returned overnight, they probably had ill intentions. I’m afraid they might try to force you to hand over power today, so you need to prepare in advance.”

“I understand. I thought about it for a long time last night and have already decided how to deal with them. Just trust me.”

Yue Xiaoshan’s way of handling things completely inherited Yue Han’s character. She could turn a blind eye to minor issues and not pursue them too thoroughly, showing mercy. However, when it came to principle matters, she was decisive and merciless. Anyone who wanted to split the New Yue Group would touch her innermost boundary, and she would break their limbs without hesitation.

“That’s good.”

Since Yue Xiaoshan had already made a decision, Su Nantian didn’t say much more. He silently drove the car towards New Yue Group. Although he had only been there once, his memory of the route was clear; he could find it even with his eyes closed.

Twenty minutes later, Su Nantian parked the car smoothly at the entrance of New Yue Group’s building. He was about to get out and open the door for Yue Xiaoshan when she suddenly instructed: “Nantian, don’t call me by my name inside the company. Address me as Miss Yue, okay?”

“Ah, I see. After all, I’m an outsider; the staff here don’t know me. Plus, my identity needs to be kept secret, so I should stay low.”

Su Nantian understood Yue Xiaoshan’s cautious attitude. At this time, he needed to stay hidden deeper, possibly playing the role of a pig to eat a tiger. In the right moment, he could strike back at the enemy.

He then got out of the car and opened the door. Yue Xiaoshan took a deep breath and slowly stepped down from the vehicle.

Today, she wore a black business suit with a white shirt underneath. She looked sharp and professional, making an impressive impression.

“Good morning, Miss Yue.”

“Good morning, Miss Yue.”

Employees arriving at New Yue Group in the morning saw Yue Xiaoshan entering and hurriedly greeted her with nods. Yue Xiaoshan didn’t respond but offered a professional smile, nodding repeatedly.

Su Nantian casually parked the car and quickly turned off the engine before getting out. He followed Yue Xiaoshan into the first-floor lobby and took the elevator to the twenty-fourth floor, where the chairman’s office was located.

Given Yue Han's current condition, even if they found Yangyang Vine to remove the poison from his body, he would be severely weakened. After all, he was over fifty years old; his physical functions and recovery abilities were far from those of a twenty or thirty-year-old.

Su Nantian could only do his best to save Yue Han’s life. As for his subsequent health recovery, it would have to be gradually adjusted at home.

In the coming years, he wouldn’t be able to work normally. All the heavy burdens of the group would fall on Yue Xiaoshan’s shoulders, and from now on, the chairman's office would become her daily workplace.

Ding.

One minute later, the elevator stopped at the twenty-fourth floor. Yue Xiaoshan and Su Nantian stepped out of the elevator, facing the entrance to the chairman’s office.

Yue Han loved classical things. His belongings all had an ancient and elegant feel, even the office decor was similar to a family study. At first glance, it felt like entering an operating antique shop.

“Good morning, Miss Yue.”

Seeing Yue Xiaoshan approaching, the two secretaries at the office door quickly stood up to greet her.

One was tall and bony, named Xu Xi. She was Yue Xiaoshan’s personal secretary. The other had a round face and looked plump, named Jiang Lili. She was Yue Han’s secretary. Now both of them had to assist Yue Xiaoshan in handling the group's affairs.

“Good morning.”

Yue Xiaoshan said while walking. “My father has been unwell recently, and from now on, I will be handling all the group’s affairs. I’ll be working here daily. Please have everyone come to me for instructions.”

Upon hearing this, the two secretaries nodded in agreement: “Yes, Miss Yue.”

Over these past years, although Yue Han had held the title of chairman of New Yue Group, it was actually Yue Xiaoshan who handled most affairs. Everyone in the group knew this situation. The senior and middle-level managers had also interacted with Yue Xiaoshan many times, so they wouldn’t doubt the authenticity of this. After all, the group would eventually be handed over to Yue Xiaoshan; it was better for everyone to adapt early on.

“Miss Yue, who is this?”

Seeing Su Nantian boldly following Yue Xiaoshan into the office, Jiang Lili, the round-faced secretary on the left, asked softly. After all, this was a key area of the group; it wasn’t acceptable to let an unknown outsider in freely.

Yue Xiaoshan raised her eyebrows and coldly introduced: “Oh, his name is Su Nantian. He’s my bodyguard. From now on, he will follow me wherever I go. You don’t need to worry about him; just ignore his presence.”

“Haha, I’ve become invisible.”

Su Nantian sighed and shrugged. He took a pile of newspapers from the bookshelf by the door and sat down on the sofa on the right, beginning to slowly flip through them without feeling constrained.

“Yes, Miss Yue. We understand.”

The two secretaries exchanged glances and quickly accepted the situation. Then, Yue Xiaoshan sat at her desk and swiftly processed the documents that needed her approval, occasionally making notes with a pen.

By around ten o’clock, Jiang Lili hurriedly pushed the door open and entered with an anxious expression. She said to Yue Xiaoshan: “Miss Yue, something’s wrong. The several young masters of the Yue family suddenly entered the company and said they wanted you to convene a shareholders’ meeting.”

“Convene a shareholders' meeting? Do they have the right to do so?”

Upon hearing this, Yue Xiaoshan looked up from correcting documents and let out a sneer. It seemed she didn’t take these so-called young masters of the Yue family seriously.

New Yue Group was founded by Yue Han. The entire group’s shares were held within the family. To convene a shareholders’ meeting, one needed at least forty percent of shares to have influence.

According to the family hierarchy, these so-called young masters were Yue Xiaoshan’s cousins. Their fathers had secretly returned to Jiangcheng overnight, and now these younger generations were coming to the company to stir up trouble. It was clearly a test, and their behavior was truly despicable.

Yue Xiaoshan thought for a moment and asked Jiang Lili with a frown: “Only your cousins came, right? Not the uncles?”

Jiang Lili nodded definitely: “Yes, only the young masters.”

“Hmph. I think their fathers wouldn’t dare to come either.”

Yue Xiaoshan waved her hand at Jiang Lili and said: “Alright, go ahead. I’ll be there shortly.”

After the secretary left, Yue Xiaoshan asked Su Nantian with a slightly serious expression: “What do you think about this?”

“What else can I think? Just look with my eyes.”

Su Nantian put down the newspaper and said slowly: “It’s obvious they came to the company today mainly to test the waters, to see your movements and how you would respond. They’ll then find a way to counter.”

“Hmm, I think the same.”

Yue Xiaoshan nodded in agreement. At this point, they only knew that Yue Han had been poisoned and was unconscious. Therefore, the power of New Yue Group would eventually fall into Yue Xiaoshan’s hands.

Chapter 304: Stealing Money?

Thus, they had sent their younger generations to pressure Yue Xiaoshan and try to break her psychological defenses. At the same time, they were also testing how Yue Xiaoshan would respond to them, searching for a way to counter.

After Su Nantian carefully analyzed the situation, he was concerned and advised Yue Xiaoshan: “Xiaoshan, since they dared to openly invite you to convene a shareholders’ meeting, it means they currently hold a considerable number of shares. It’s possible that the scattered shares are all in their hands. You should be mentally prepared for this.”

“Hmph, what does that matter? Do you think your father’s cautious personality would leave such an obvious flaw?”

Yue Xiaoshan lifted her chin and confidently replied: “My father alone controls forty percent of the group’s shares. I have eleven percent, totaling an absolute majority. What do they have to force me with?”

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian suddenly understood: “Ah, that’s right. It seems Yue Han had foresight and already planned for this.”

After a few more conversations, Yue Xiaoshan led Su Nantian out of the office. The round-faced secretary was already waiting outside, and then the three of them took the elevator to the twentieth-floor conference room.

At this time, the conference room was already crowded with people. There were managers from various departments and shareholders who held shares, all gathered to await the final outcome of this shareholders’ meeting. They were curious if New Yue Group would truly change hands.

Yue Xiaoshan strode into the conference room and saw several well-dressed young men sitting around the large table. She directly sat down in the central seat and waved her hand impatiently: “Ah, everyone is here. Let’s not waste time; let’s start immediately.”

There were four people who had come to stir up trouble. They sat on both sides, with the leader being Yue Meng, the son of Second Uncle Yuelin. Behind him were Yue Yuan, the son of Third Uncle, and Yue Miao and Xu Ai, the sons of Fifth Uncle. Basically, all the collateral branches of New Yue Group were present.

Yue Han was the head of the group, and he had only one descendant: his daughter, Yue Xiaoshan. As for Yue Xiaoshan’s mother, she had been working abroad to expand the overseas market and rarely returned home. She didn’t interfere with domestic company affairs.

Other than that, the remaining people were collateral branches. These people had long been eyeing the group’s interests and attempted to forcibly divide the shares held by Yue Han and his daughter.

Fortunately, Yue Han wasn’t foolish. He had tightly controlled the company’s power, so they had resorted to poisoning Yue Han.

Last night, those old foxes secretly returned to Jiangcheng with the intention of taking advantage of the situation and forcing Yue Han and Yue Xiaoshan to hand over power. However, now that Yue Han was unconscious and Yue Xiaoshan had taken control of the group, they were all celebrating. After all, Yue Xiaoshan was definitely easier to deal with than Yue Han. They were afraid of being taken advantage of, so they didn’t appear themselves but instead let their younger generations come to the company and test Yue Xiaoshan. It was truly despicable.

As soon as Yue Xiaoshan spoke, the leader, Yue Meng, quickly interjected: “Ah, Xiaoshan, why are you so angry? We’re all family members. We are siblings who share the same blood, right?”

“Exactly! Meng, you’re right. It’s rare for us to come to the company. Do you have to give us a cold shoulder?”

“Xiaoshan, are you so focused on business that you want to attack your own family?”

“Hmph. She’s not even the chairman yet, and she already has this attitude towards us. Once she becomes the chairman, we might all be kicked out!”

Under Yue Meng’s leadership, the other young masters of the Yue family began to verbally attack and criticize Yue Xiaoshan. They were almost ready to fight with her.

Su Nantian crossed his arms and watched from behind Yue Xiaoshan. His task was to protect Yue Xiaoshan’s safety.

As for the internal interests of New Yue Group, he was an outsider and didn’t want to interfere too much. Moreover, he had confidence in Yue Xiaoshan. He believed that with her abilities and determination, she would definitely handle this matter properly.

After the group had spoken for over a minute, Yue Xiaoshan calmly picked up her water glass and took a sip. Then she asked softly: “Have you finished talking? You’ve used so much energy, your throat must be dry. Have some tea to moisten it and continue talking later.”

“You!”

Being ignored by her side, Yue Meng was extremely angry. Before coming here, he had anticipated that Yue Xiaoshan’s mental strength was strong and she would be difficult to deal with. He had imagined countless scenarios, but he hadn’t expected Yue Xiaoshan to completely ignore their performance. This left the group feeling like they had punched thin air, with no place to strike.

At this point, it was impossible to retreat halfway. Yue Meng gritted his teeth and signaled Yue Yuan with a glance, indicating that he should clarify the issue and have Yue Xiaoshan hand over the shares.

Compared to the cunning Yue Meng, Yue Yuan was a foolish brute who could easily be manipulated. Upon seeing Yue Meng’s glance, he suddenly slammed his hand on the table and jumped up from his seat. He pointed at Yue Xiaoshan and shouted: “Yue Xiaoshan, I tell you, don’t be so ungrateful. We came here today out of respect for your father. If we break off relations, it would be bad for everyone. I advise you to hand over the group’s shares immediately; otherwise, we’ll take them ourselves.”

“Ah? Is that giving me respect for my father? I didn’t notice it at all,”

Yue Xiaoshan remained indifferent and glanced at the aggressive Yue Yuan. She coldly said: “Alright, if you want me to hand over the shares, it’s fine. You just need to come up with real money and buy them at one billion per point. If you have the money, I’ll hand over the entire group to you. What do you think of this?”

Upon hearing this, Yue Yuan widened his eyes and exclaimed: “One billion per point? Yue Xiaoshan, you’re stealing money!”

“Oh, you know the word ‘stealing’ too,”

Before Yue Yuan could finish speaking, Yue Xiaoshan interrupted him firmly: “Then why did you come straight away and ask me to hand over the shares? Isn’t that stealing money too? You have the nerve to say those words!”

According to New Yue Group’s current market value, it was approximately fifty billion. In other words, one percent of the shares equaled five hundred million. This price was reasonable, so Yue Yuan felt that Yue Xiaoshan had overreached and was stealing money from them.

“Stupid girl, you’re looking for death!”

Yue Yuan was a rough person. Thinking was too hard for him, and he would rather hit than talk.

Now that Yue Xiaoshan had angered him, his first reaction was to rush forward and hit her twice to show her his strength.

The other young masters of the Yue family sat still, watching with a cold expression. Yue Miao even softly whistled and was almost about to clap his hands.

Seeing Yue Yuan rushing forward, Yue Xiaoshan remained motionless and didn’t even blink. She believed that before Yue Yuan got close to her, Su Nantian would definitely teach this kid a lesson.

“Hey!”

Yue Yuan shouted and swung his hand towards Yue Xiaoshan’s face. He seemed to already hear the clear sound of a slap one second later, which was too beautiful.

Smack!

The sound that followed was somewhat dull and not the clear slap he had imagined. He looked closely and realized that at some point, the guy behind Yue Xiaoshan had grabbed his wrist. His arm was now stuck.

“Sir, please respect Miss Yue,”

Su Nantian politely reminded him. He turned his hand and pulled Yue Yuan out, throwing the kid to the ground. The kid almost hit his head on the corner of a chair.

“Good, you’ve got some skills. Seems like you’re a martial artist. Come on, let’s fight again; I’ll break your legs!”

Yue Yuan felt he had lost face in front of his brothers. He didn’t give up and turned to rush forward again, this time targeting Su Nantian. Yue Xiaoshan covered her eyes and didn’t want to watch his fate.

Smack!

Unlike the previous dull sound, this one was a solid explosion. Before Yue Yuan could even get close, Su Nantian struck him in the stomach with his leg.

This kick used three parts of strength, sending Yue Yuan, who weighed nearly one hundred and eighty pounds, flying. He collided with an empty chair beside him and couldn’t recover for a while.

“Hey, brothers, fight!”

Seeing Yue Yuan had suffered a big loss at Su Nantian’s hands, the other young masters were upset and rolled up their sleeves to attack.

“Everyone stay calm.”

Seeing the situation was bad, Yue Meng quickly stopped them. He knew well how strong Yue Yuan was. At least, the four of them together weren’t enough to fight this guy.

At this moment, Yue Yuan hadn’t even managed a single move against Su Nantian. This showed how terrifying Su Nantian’s combat power was. If they rushed forward, it would be like seeking death. He wasn’t that foolish to think his life was too long.

“Misunderstanding, all misunderstandings. Yue Yuan is too impulsive. I’ll apologize to this brother on his behalf.”

Yue Meng said softly while waving at the remaining two, indicating they should quickly help Yue Yuan to one side for a short rest. If necessary, they could send him to the hospital after the meeting.

Su Nantian smiled and said: “Haha, I think this is also a misunderstanding. Then I’ll accept your apology. In the future, let that brother not be so impulsive; it’s easy to hurt himself.”

“Yes, you’re absolutely right. I’ll definitely advise him well,”

Yue Meng nodded and then said to Yue Xiaoshan: “Xiaoshan, we didn’t come here with any other intention. You see, your father’s health is poor, and there are many things in the company. You can’t manage it alone. We’re your brothers, of course, we want to help you take on some responsibilities so that the company’s performance can soar. Do you think this is reasonable?”

“That’s a good point, but I’m still managing it fine. Your brothers’ kindness is appreciated.”

Yue Xiaoshan smiled and looked at Yue Meng, then revealed her trump card: “Oh, I forgot to tell you. My father transferred his shares to me a few days ago. Now I hold fifty-one percent of the group’s shares. The total shares outside are not as much as mine. From now on, I’ll be the one making decisions in the company. If anyone finds it hard to accept, they can just leave now. I promise not to stop them.”

“I…,”

Yue Meng had planned to take advantage of the situation and gather scattered shares into his hands before attacking Yue Xiaoshan. He intended to first force her to give up the position of chairman and gradually swallow the entire company. However, Yue Xiaoshan had given him no opportunity at all.

With absolute control over the shares, Yue Xiaoshan could do whatever she wanted. As long as she didn’t transfer her shares, the internal affairs of the group would become her one-man rule. She could say anything she wanted; those who didn’t want to stay could just leave without any negotiation.

“I understand.”

His plan was instantly ruined. Yue Meng felt defeated and nodded with a depressed expression, then waved to his brothers and left the conference room quickly. The so-called shareholders’ meeting ended dramatically.

Watching Yue Meng and others leave, Su Nantian joked: “Xiaoshan, I didn’t expect you to be so strong. They’re all useless and couldn’t match your strength.”

“Of course,”

Yue Xiaoshan proudly replied: “If I couldn’t handle these useless guys, how could I manage the vast New Yue Group? However, their commotion was good. It made everyone in the company realize who truly holds power. Those with ulterior motives would stay quiet for two months and not cause trouble.”

Checking the time, it was already ten thirty. Yue Xiaoshan had spent the morning reviewing documents. There wasn’t much to do in the afternoon, so she wanted to go home directly.

Yue Han’s current condition was very poor; he needed her careful care. Thinking of this, she turned to Su Nantian and said: “Nantian, the company is more or less settled. Now we’re going home.”

“Okay,”

Su Nantian nodded without hesitation. He was just a driver and bodyguard; his task was to protect Yue Xiaoshan’s safety. Wherever Yue Xiaoshan went, he would follow without questioning.

Afterward, the two of them left the conference room and took the elevator to the first-floor lobby. They exited through the main entrance of the building, and Su Nantian drove off quickly, returning to Yue’s villa.

Seeing them return home, Yue Hai stood at the garage entrance to greet them. When Yue Xiaoshan got out of the car, he quickly ran over and asked: “Miss Yue, did anything major happen at the company today?”

“Oh, nothing major. It was just Yue Meng and others coming to cause trouble. I dealt with them in a few words.”

Yue Xiaoshan never took Yue Meng and others seriously. The people she truly needed to be cautious of were the fathers of Yue Meng and others. These useless young masters couldn’t do much, and in her eyes, they were just causing trouble without any significance.

“Oh, good. Good,”

At this point, Yue Hai finally relaxed slightly. The head housekeeper had been worried all morning about major incidents within the group. Now, seeing Yue Xiaoshan’s composed expression and light-hearted manner, it seemed there were no problems.

Chapter 306: Successfully Resolved

Then he furrowed his brows and said to Yue Xiaoshan: “Miss Yue, there’s some bad news. Our people have been calling and using connections since last night. They’ve tried to reach everyone they could, but no one has any Yangyang Vine. The old man’s condition is urgent; what should we do now?”

“No one has Yangyang Vine? How is that possible!”

Yue Hai’s words shocked Yue Xiaoshan. Since Su Nantian had mentioned Yangyang Vine could cure the poison yesterday, she had hoped to quickly acquire one and administer it to her father. If necessary, she could even spend some money to buy several more, but the problem was that despite the Yue family’s connections and influence, after over ten hours of searching, they hadn’t found any. Was this herb really that rare?

After saying this, Yue Xiaoshan instinctively turned her gaze to Su Nantian. This method of detoxification was his suggestion, and since he had mentioned Yangyang Vine could cure the cold poison, it meant he must have seen it before. Yue Xiaoshan wanted to ask him if he knew where to find it.

“Why are you looking at me? I’m not a herbalist.”

Before Yue Xiaoshan could speak, Su Nantian understood her implied meaning. He spread his hands and shook his head: “This herb has very strict growing conditions, a long growth cycle. Once harvested, it must be carefully preserved to maintain its medicinal properties. It’s a rare treasure that can only be found by chance. Maybe you should call again and ask people to search everywhere.”

“But Uncle Hai’s team has spent so much time without finding any news about Yangyang Vine. Do you think they might still find it?”

At this moment, Yue Xiaoshan’s words carried a faint tone of crying. There was no way to find Yangyang Vine, and Yue Han’s life was in danger. As his precious daughter, she couldn’t bear to watch her father die.

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian immediately asked: “Wait, are you sure they’ve checked every place? What about the Dragon Group?”

In his mind, the Dragon Group’s most secure warehouse was definitely a place with everything. It wasn’t strange for something to appear there.

Given the close relationship between Old Du and Yue Han, Old Du had described this security mission as extremely serious. He even spent a lot of resources to send Su Nantian out. If the Dragon Group had Yangyang Vine, which could save Yue Han’s life, Old Du wouldn’t be stingy. Or was it that Yue Hai and others hadn’t asked Old Du?

“Ah? The Dragon Group has herbs?”

After Su Nantian spoke, Yue Xiaoshan blinked in confusion. The surrounding Yue Hai was also at a loss; it seemed they hadn’t considered this possibility.

Su Nantian furrowed his brows and thought: “Excuse me, Xiaoshan, let me ask one more question. What’s your impression of the Dragon Group?”

“National Security Bureau, 6th Division. It's a national law enforcement agency, similar to provincial and municipal inspection departments,” Yue Xiaoshan thought for a moment before giving a clear answer.

“Okay, I guess I was too hasty.”

Seeing this situation, Su Nantian understood what had happened. Clearly, the people who had communicated with Old Du before were only Yue Han himself. Others, including Yue Xiaoshan, knew little about it. They had only a superficial understanding and didn’t know the true strength of the Dragon Group.

At this moment, Yue Han was unconscious due to poisoning. This indirectly cut off contact with Old Du. If it weren’t for Su Nantian’s initiative, Yue Xiaoshan and Yue Hai would have never thought of who to ask for medicine.

Compared to the naive Yue Xiaoshan, Yue Hai was more perceptive. He immediately asked: “Little Su, do you mean the Dragon Group has Yangyang Vine?”

“Maybe it does.”

Su Nantian didn’t want to be too definite. He guided: “After all, the Dragon Group has various rare herbs. Even if they can’t find Yangyang Vine, there might be other extremely hot and yang substitutes. You need to ask Old Du yourself.”

“Okay, I understand. My father’s phone has Old Du’s number. I’ll call him immediately to discuss this.”

Then, Yue Hai hurriedly went upstairs to make the call. Yue Xiaoshan finally regained her composure and said in disbelief: “Nantian, did I hear correctly? Finding Yangyang Vine is that simple?”

“Yes, it really is that simple. People often overcomplicate things; I don’t understand.”

Su Nantian said with a philosophical tone, appearing very wise.

“Okay, you’re the one who talks big,”

Yue Xiaoshan rolled her eyes and said with a lighter tone: “If we really can find the medicine to cure my father from the Dragon Group, I’ll definitely thank you and treat you to a big meal.”

Su Nantian teased: “Hehe, then you should prepare several tables; otherwise, I’m afraid I won’t be full.”

Yue Xiaoshan assured: “I’ll treat you to an entire street, and I’ll definitely feed you until full!”

With that, the two of them had a brief chat. The Yue Hai who had gone to call returned quickly with a smiling face.

Seeing him so happy, Yue Xiaoshan asked hurriedly: “Uncle Hai, did you get news?”

Yue Hai nodded repeatedly: “Yes, I asked Old Du. He said it was okay. Not only does he have Yangyang Vine, but also other herbs. They will send them over overnight. Then we’ll need to rely on you, Little Su.”

“Okay, as long as the herbs are found, everything is fine.”
