Qi Yinzhen respectfully answered the senior officials, then added: "Actually, this matter is my fault. I should have consulted headquarters before secretly collaborating with Su Nantian. I thought his previous successes guaranteed this mission's victory, so I agreed to work with him."

Qi Yinzhen truly believed Su Nantian's plan was foolproof, yet he never anticipated this grave oversight would lead to such a catastrophe.

As these thoughts surfaced, Qi Yinzhen hesitated again, unable to continue speaking.

After a moment's pause, he regained his voice and continued: "My flawed judgment and indulgence led to Su Nantian's downfall. This is my fault, and I will not hide it. I am ready to accept headquarters' punishment."

He added: "But I beg headquarters for a little more time. Let me find Su Nantian first, and then I will personally submit to my punishment."

With that, Qi Yinzhen immediately lowered his head and bowed deeply.

Initially, Qi Yinzhen had also considered Su Nantian's independent actions reckless, but Su Nantian was resolute in his defiance and refused to heed Qi Yinzhen's advice.

Moreover, Qi Yinzhen was well acquainted with Su Nantian's personality; he knew Su Nantian would merely offer a polite report without truly seeking approval. Regardless of whether Su Nantian agreed or refused, he would act according to his own will.

Realizing this, Qi Yinzhen slowly lowered his head again, knowing he could never persuade Su Nantian and had already prepared for punishment.

"Never mind those matters now," the senior official said, waving a hand to dismiss the concern.

After all, the immediate priority was locating Su Nantian; other matters could be postponed. Moreover, the senior officials were well-acquainted with Su Nantian and understood this plan was entirely his idea. Qi Yinzhen had no power to alter Su Nantian's decisions. Thus, they had no intention of truly punishing Qi Yinzhen.

"Let us play the videos now. Perhaps we can find some clues," the senior official said, gesturing for Qi Yinzhen to play all the surveillance footage obtained from the Wu family.

Qi Yinzhen nodded and immediately played the videos.

When the footage showed Su Nantian fighting alone against numerous Wu family security guards, everyone was on edge. Especially when they saw Wu You'er killed by the security forces and Su Nantian's furious breakdown, their moods darkened considerably.

In the end, when they saw Su Nantian kill Wu Chuan to avenge Wu You'er, they all sighed in relief.

But at this critical moment, Su Nantian was betrayed by the Wu family security forces.

Chapter 760: Searching for Su Nantian

Su Nantian was struck by a powerful weapon in the chest—a vulnerable part of the body. Moreover, he fell directly into the lotus pond!

When they saw this, all senior officials immediately stood up, their emotions stirred. Some even inhaled sharply, as if unable to accept the grim news.

"Good heavens! He fell into it!" one person exclaimed involuntarily, and others turned their gazes toward him, their eyes filled with disapproval.

"I refuse to believe it!"

At this moment, Qi Yinzhen spoke firmly: "Su Nantian is blessed with great fortune. He will not perish so easily!"

As he spoke, Qi Yinzhen clenched his fist and gazed resolutely at everyone.

The senior officials nodded in agreement: "I share your view. If Su Nantian were so short-lived, he could not have completed so many outstanding missions! I believe he is unharmed!"

After a pause, the senior official continued with unwavering certainty: "Moreover, I trust my instincts."

Yet others still wore anxious expressions, untouched by their resolute words.

After all, they had seen Su Nantian was not simply thrown into the lotus pond but severely wounded by a security guard. They had seen his chest fabric completely stained red.

Though Su Nantian's abilities were extraordinary, and he was a cultivator, he was still human. Even with self-healing abilities, could he recover so swiftly in such harsh conditions?

Furthermore, the surveillance footage had continuously captured this location. If Su Nantian were truly unharmed, why hadn't he surfaced from the lotus pond? Why had he not reported back to headquarters?

At this thought, their expressions darkened further—nearly 80% certain Su Nantian had met his fate.

"Enough, don't look so gloomy. This is just our speculation. Regardless, we must search for him first!"

The senior official interrupted everyone's somber thoughts and continued: "First, let us thoroughly search the lotus pond. Even if we have to dig three feet deep, we must find Su Nantian!"

He added: "This task is entrusted to you, Qi Yinzhen. I command you to fully investigate Su Nantian's whereabouts. No matter what, you must bring him back!"

He paused slightly before resolutely declaring: "Alive or dead, we must see him."

No matter what, they would not easily abandon Su Nantian. Even if he had truly sacrificed himself, they would not let him rest in the cold depths of the pond.

"Yes! I will complete the mission!"

Qi Yinzhen stood with his legs together and answered loudly. His eyes, however, were red from weeping.

He would not give up so easily. He would find Su Nantian—alive!

Meanwhile, Su Nantian was unaware that the outside world had gone into chaos over his disappearance. Everyone searched for him relentlessly.

And no one knew that the person causing such desperation was currently living a leisurely life in this picturesque fishing village.

"Uncle! You're so amazing! You caught so many fish so quickly!"

Xiaowang, still a child unaware of the world's complexities, took Su Nantian as his uncle after hearing his grandfather call him so. He genuinely regarded Su Nantian as family and adored him, constantly following him everywhere.

Xiaowang had become Su Nantian's shadow; wherever he went, Xiaowang trailed.

"Is that so? Uncle will catch you two more; we'll have a full fish banquet tonight."

Su Nantian smiled affectionately, ruffling Xiaowang's head. With a swift motion, he plunged into the water.

This was Su Nantian's unique fishing method—unlike other villagers, he needed no tools. His bare hands sufficed.

Moreover, by striking the water's surface with a single palm, he could stir up countless fish. Compared to netting, it was far easier and more efficient.

This talent did not only attract Xiaowang but also drew a crowd of children by the river. They stared wide-eyed, fascinated by Su Nantian's movements.

Two children had their mouths open, drooling without even realizing it.

"Xiaowang, your uncle is so amazing! I wish I had such an uncle too," a boy in blue remarked enviously.

"Of course! He's my uncle!" Xiaowang boasted proudly, his tail nearly touching the sky.

"Here you go."

Su Nantian lightly pressed against the water's surface, leaping back up. He performed an unknown gesture, and within seconds, his damp clothes were completely dried—no sign he had been in the water.

Su Nantian was not stingy; he distributed some fish to the children, and the rest he took home with Xiaowang.

Su Nantian had spent these days with Xiaowang, repeating the same routine. In this time, he had become a new idol in the fishing village. The children adored him and clung to him constantly.

Seeing the children's affection, the villagers also believed Su Nantian was no villain. They treated him with even more courtesy.

Another day passed, and the fishing village's remote location offered little entertainment. Yet this solitude stretched time, making each day feel long and filled with activities.

"Wang Shu," Su Nantian said, carrying Xiaowang who had played all day and was now asleep. He placed him in bed before stepping back out.

"I've explored the fishing village these days, but I haven't found any schools. Xiaowang and the others run around all day; he's of school age, isn't he?"

Su Nantian glanced at the sleeping Xiaowang and asked further.

Was this all they would do?

"Ah, since you've already toured the village, you should know it's a dead end. There are only dozens of households here—no schools at all," the elder sighed and replied, "Besides, Xiaowang is still young. He's only six; there's no rush to send him to school."

Chapter 761: Persuasion

"But we can't ignore this. He's still young, but in a few years, if he doesn't receive systematic education, there may be problems later," Su Nantian mused before speaking to the elder. His concern for Xiaowang was evident.

This clever child—Su Nantian would not let him become a crude, uneducated man.

"I know your thoughts," the elder replied, "This village has never had a school before. There are only about ten children here, and its remote location makes it impossible for teachers to stay."

For years, the fishing village had seen outsiders come and go. Yet none remained permanently; only the elderly stayed behind.

The elder's expression paused before continuing: "Moreover, there is a primary school in the town nearby. Many villagers send their children there. However, they must walk back and forth daily—this is no short distance. Children Xiaowang's age are too young for this, usually starting school at ten."

In fact, ten was already quite early. Many parents hesitated to send their children alone on such a long mountain path, waiting until they were over ten.

By then, the children had learned nothing and clashed with town kids in age groups. They would only learn a couple of years before returning to the village, remaining unambitious and ignorant.

But this issue had persisted for centuries; the elder could do nothing but accept it. He could only keep Xiaowang close, occasionally teaching him a few characters and arithmetic to ease his transition to the town school.

Su Nantian had intended to persuade the elder further, but upon hearing this and seeing his troubled face, he understood the elder's difficulties. He wisely stopped pressing further and remained silent.

Soon, Su Nantian realized this fishing village was even more backward than he had imagined. It lacked not only schools but also a proper doctor. Several children with severe fevers were treated merely by picking herbs—whether they recovered was left to fate.

"Have you ever considered leaving this fishing village?" Su Nantian asked after witnessing this, his concern deepening. He was young and strong, but the elder was old, and Xiaowang was too young. If they fell ill, would they have to rely on these unknown herbs?

He longed to persuade them to leave the village and live elsewhere, where life was faster-paced. At least Xiaowang could receive systematic education, and their health would be secured.

Upon hearing Su Nantian's suggestion, the elder immediately darkened his face.

"Our family has lived in this village for generations. We've always managed to survive like this. Why should it be different now? You don't need to persuade me—I will stay here, even if I die!"

The elder said this and darkened his face again without giving Su Nantian a chance to respond, turning back into his room.

Su Nantian watched the elder's hasty departure and quickly understood why he was angry. After all, with his age and lifelong residence in this isolated place, his thoughts were inevitably conservative. They did have the saying of returning to one's roots and never leaving home in old age.

Yet, after these thoughts, Su Nantian's worries deepened.

Since the villagers had accepted him so readily and treated him kindly, he could not ignore them entirely. He wanted to contribute and improve their lives.

After this, Su Nantian had an idea.

"What? You want to be a doctor here?"

The elder was stunned the next day when Su Nantian shared his idea. He stared at Su Nantian in disbelief: "Did you used to be a doctor? Why would you have this idea?"

Otherwise, why would Su Nantian propose such a plan?

As he thought this, the elder looked at Su Nantian with suspicion.

If Su Nantian's profession was merely a simple doctor, how could he have been severely injured and thrown into a river?

These questions made it impossible for the elder to believe.

"I'm not a doctor," Su Nantian shook his head and answered honestly, "But I'm not entirely sure. However, I've discovered an unusual understanding of this field. Perhaps my profession is related."

Su Nantian did not know why he had this ability, but he could perform basic diagnostics—inspection, listening, questioning, and palpation. He also recognized many herbs and knew which could heal what illness.

Su Nantian understood that a thousand words were less effective than one action. So he did not continue persuading the elder but instead took his hand and placed a finger on his pulse.

After a moment's thought, he clearly described the elder's long-standing ailments.

"Wang Shu, you must have injured your lungs when young, leaving a lingering illness. You cough in the morning and evening, and especially in autumn, your throat feels dry as if something is constantly scratching it. Is that right?"

Su Nantian spoke seriously, his tone calm and measured.

The elder had initially doubted Su Nantian but was stunned when he accurately described his condition. His face turned to surprise and disbelief.

He looked at Su Nantian with delight: "You really do know, don't you?"

After saying this, he scrutinized Su Nantian again, eager to see what other surprises he might bring.

"You're too kind," Su Nantian waved his hand, not wanting to appear overly skilled. Compared to the villagers of the fishing village, Su Nantian's medical skills were more than sufficient.

After diagnosing the illness, Su Nantian did not waste time but went out to gather the appropriate herbs. He brewed them into medicine and had the elder drink it.

Chapter 762: The Fishing Village Doctor

The elder, seeing Su Nantian accurately identify his illness, did not doubt the medicine. He drank it without hesitation.

After drinking, he felt his throat was much more comfortable and no longer had that persistent urge to cough.

He looked at Su Nantian with surprise, exclaiming: "You really do have some skills! I underestimated you!"

The elder was straightforward; otherwise, he would not have spoken these words directly to Su Nantian.

On one hand, the elder thought Su Nantian was remarkable; on the other, his doubts deepened.

If Su Nantian truly understood medicine, why had he ended up in such a situation? His head and chest wounds did not look like self-inflicted. If he were merely a simple doctor, how could he have been targeted as if by an enemy?

These thoughts made the elder glance at Su Nantian again, realizing his doubts and concerns could only be resolved when Su Nantian regained his memories.

"Wang Shu, you're too kind. I'm merely doing my part to help the villagers of this fishing village," Su Nantian said humbly, not taking the matter seriously and not considering his medical skills as particularly impressive.

Su Nantian added: "This is also my way of repaying your kindness for saving me. Otherwise, I might have perished in the river and become food for fish."

After saying this, he instructed the elder on how to take the herbs and what care was needed. He meticulously considered every detail, showing no negligence.

"Wang Shu, this issue isn't serious. You're just overworking yourself. Your lung problems can only be improved with rest and careful treatment—haste won't help."

After finishing his instructions, Su Nantian added.

"Good, good."

The elder had witnessed Su Nantian's true abilities and naturally followed his advice. He did everything as instructed and was deeply grateful, no longer doubting Su Nantian at all.

With the first person to try it, other villagers came hesitantly to see Su Nantian.

At first, they did so out of respect for the elder but also to test whether Su Nantian truly had this ability.

After they all came, they found he could indeed diagnose their health issues and provide effective treatments—far better than the herbs they had used before.

Each person, like the elder, moved from initial disbelief to cautious trust and finally wholehearted faith in Su Nantian. They regarded his words as divine, strictly following his instructions.

Thus, the name "Divine Doctor Su Nantian" spread throughout the fishing village. The news flew like wings, gaining unanimous approval from the villagers.

When Su Nantian first heard this title, he found it amusing and repeatedly urged the villagers not to use it. He could not bear such a title.

But others had become accustomed to it and continued calling him "Divine Doctor Su Nantian," no matter how he tried to change it.

Su Nantian could not alter their perception of him and simply ignored the title, no longer paying attention to it.

Su Nantian devoted himself daily to treating the villagers' health, repaying their acceptance.

This way, he had initially relied on the elder's good reputation to stay in the fishing village. Though they were kind, they still felt he was an outsider and had some reservations about him.

But now that Su Nantian could heal people and became the village's first doctor, genuinely helping them, they truly accepted him.

They also treated him with more courtesy and kindness.

Moreover, Su Nantian not only diligently treated the villagers but also did not hoard his knowledge. He shared some simple treatments he had memorized, enabling them to learn basic methods and treat minor illnesses without relying on traditional folk remedies.

Su Nantian also led the villagers to find useful herbs in the mountains, teaching them how to sell these herbs at the town to improve their living conditions and ease their hardships.

With this, they loved Su Nantian more and trusted him even more.

Su Nantian instantly became the most popular person in the fishing village.

From the elderly to children just learning to speak, everyone loved Su Nantian.

The elder's house also became the most visited place in the village, becoming lively again. Xiaowang was much more cheerful than before.

Seeing this, the elder believed his decision to keep Su Nantian was a blessing rather than a misfortune. He had indeed guessed correctly about his initial view of Su Nantian; he would bring them more luck and elevate the village's life.

The villagers of the fishing village were originally simple, relying on the mountains and rivers for sustenance. No one had thought of other ways to live.

Now, with Su Nantian's guidance, their lives were no longer as simple and harsh. They had improved significantly.

Previously, some children could only eat fish from the village, lacking other foods and essential nutrients, making them weak and frail.

But since Su Nantian informed them of these issues, the villagers began to pay attention.

The children in the fishing village were now healthier and smarter than before. Everyone was deeply grateful to Su Nantian.

The village's life passed quietly, but soon this peace was broken.

That day, Su Nantian checked the elder's health as usual.

Suddenly, urgent voices echoed at the door, and their footsteps were heavy, sounding very anxious.

Upon hearing this noise, Su Nantian immediately went out to check.

Soon, he saw two villagers carrying a young man and rushing in.

The young man's head was bloodied, as if struck by a heavy object. Blood flowed continuously, staining most of his face.

"Uncle Wang! Uncle Wang!"

The two villagers supported the young man and called out to Su Nantian.

Since Su Nantian had claimed to be the elder's distant nephew, everyone believed his alias "Wang Li" and called him "Divine Doctor Wang."

The elders who had been checking their health also came out upon hearing the commotion. Seeing this scene, they all gasped: "What a tragedy! What happened to Xiao Chen? Why is he so severely injured!"

The fishing village had only a few residents. Though Su Nantian had been there for a short time, his excellent memory allowed him to remember everyone he met.

Thus, Su Nantian recognized the injured young man and the two villagers supporting him.

Yet he had not expected Xiao Chen to be so seriously injured.

"Quickly, bring him in! I'll check his condition!"

The head was crucial. With so much blood loss, it was unclear how severe the injury was.

Thus, despite his curiosity about why Xiao Chen had been injured, Su Nantian's immediate priority was to bring him in for examination.

"Yes, yes!"

The two villagers nodded upon hearing Su Nantian's words and carried Xiao Chen in together.

"Xiao Chen, do you feel any pain elsewhere?"

Su Nantian knew head injuries could be minor or major. To avoid more serious issues, he needed to keep the injured person conscious.

As he assisted in checking, he asked Xiao Chen.

"No,"
Xiao Chen, severely injured and losing blood, had a pale face and spoke weakly.

He shook his head to inform Su Nantian: "Thank you, Divine Doctor Wang."

"Enough, there's no need to thank me,"
Su Nantian shook his head and continued checking the wound. Seeing Xiao Chen was still conscious, he felt relieved and asked the two villagers: "What happened? Why did he get his head smashed like this?"

"It was those villains!"
One villager said angrily, recalling the villains' evil deeds. His face showed more anger, considering these villains despicable.

"Ah, Xiao Chen was injured by those villains,"
The other villager sighed and explained to Su Nantian: "They are heartless! They do evil things, bullying the innocent. They don't fear retribution!"

Su Nantian did not believe in such things as karma. If there were any, those villains would not have ruled the village for so long.

But now Su Nantian had a bigger question: "Villains?"

Su Nantian asked in surprise, while treating Xiao Chen's wound: "Are there such people here in the fishing village?"

Su Nantian remembered the elder had said this village had only about thirty households. Everyone knew each other, and they had lived here for generations.

If such villains existed in this context, Su Nantian would be truly puzzled.

Who was so heartless as to threaten their own villagers?

After thinking this, Su Nantian felt even more confused.

"Oh! Divine Doctor Wang, it's not like that!"
The villager realized Su Nantian had misunderstood and quickly explained: "It's not like that. Our villagers are all good people, so they wouldn't do such evil things. These villains are from the town."

"Yes!"
The other villager quickly added: "They took advantage of our village's small population and the elderly and children who couldn't fight back, often threatening us. They never showed any restraint."

After a pause, the villager continued angrily: "Now that we've learned to gather herbs and some valuable items from the mountains to sell, these villains have targeted us even more!"

At this point, the villagers' expressions turned even more indignant and angry.

"This is it! Xiao Chen went out to sell herbs today, and these villains targeted him to steal his money!"

The villagers spoke one after another, clearly explaining the incident's background.

"But Xiao Chen is honest; if they asked for money, he would have given it to them. However, Xiao Chen refused to give in and fought back!"

The villager continued, casting a reprimanding glance at Xiao Chen. He thought Xiao Chen valued money more than his life, and if something happened, it would be a disaster.

"As a result, these villains weren't nice people at all! When they saw Xiao Chen dared to resist, they immediately grabbed a brick from the ground and smashed his head!"

At this point, the villager pointed to Xiao Chen's head.

"If my brother and I hadn't returned from the market and seen Xiao Chen lying on the road with his head covered, he might have died there!"

Thinking of this, the two villagers immediately showed fearful expressions. They were clearly worried about such a scenario.

If they hadn't happened to pass by, Xiao Chen might have died there for sure. After all, this was a remote mountain area with many dangerous animals. If it got dark and Xiao Chen was injured, the blood scent would attract numerous wild beasts!

It was also this thought that made everyone feel Xiao Chen was too stubborn.

"No, we cannot let these villains continue,"
Xiao Chen said weakly with his eyes open. Perhaps due to excessive blood loss, his voice was weak and lifeless, and his face was very pale.

He struggled to support himself and told them: "I cannot give them this money. It's what I saved with great effort. How could I give it to them?"

Xiao Chen also harbored deep resentment toward these villains, thinking they did nothing but evil deeds.

Thinking of this, Xiao Chen's face turned angry again.

"Enough, Xiao Chen. Don't get upset,"
At this moment, Su Nantian interrupted Xiao Chen's angry words and proceeded to disinfect and bandage his wound.

Now Su Nantian had basically understood the entire incident from the villagers, including why Xiao Chen was injured and who these villains were.

They were indeed people from the town.

After thinking this through, Su Nantian's expression deepened.

Chapter 764: Teaching the Villains a Lesson

After all, this fishing village was so small it could be seen at a glance. If someone became a villain here, people would certainly not let him return.

After understanding this, Su Nantian's face showed a knowing expression.

Now that he saw Xiao Chen injured and the two villagers spoke of these villains with anger, it was clear they had also suffered from their bullying.

After this thought, Su Nantian gradually formed an idea.

He quickly bandaged Xiao Chen and gave him some medicine, instructing him to take it regularly and change the dressing.

He also reminded him to be careful with the wound, advising him to rest for these few days and avoid moving around.

"By the way, Xiao Chen, after returning home, you must rest well. Head injuries can be serious or minor; don't rush back to work just because you feel a little better."

Su Nantian added, concerned.

"Thank you, Divine Doctor Wang,"
Xiao Chen quickly thanked Su Nantian and immediately took out the money from his pocket: "Take this, Divine Doctor Wang! You saved my life; this is the medicine fee I should give you!"

Xiao Chen said this while pushing money toward Su Nantian.

They were all honest people, and every word was heartfelt. Xiao Chen truly wanted to express his gratitude to Su Nantian.

"You're right, Divine Doctor Wang! You should take it! If not for you, Xiao Chen would have been in danger!"

The two villagers also urged Su Nantian to take the money.

"Thank you, but I don't need it,"
At this moment, Su Nantian waved his hand and refused to take Xiao Chen's money: "It was just a small effort. You don't need to be so polite."

"No, no! You saved my life; how could I take such a big advantage?"
Xiao Chen shook his head immediately: "How can I be so bold?"

Xiao Chen felt that they were villagers who should support each other. Moreover, Su Nantian had truly helped him greatly; he could not just say a few words of thanks and leave it at that.

"These herbs are from the mountains; I've only bandaged you a little. It's no big deal, really just a small effort,"
Su Nantian said again, waving his hand to interrupt Xiao Chen's thanks and added: "Alright, go home and rest. I've done what I could; there's no need to talk about it anymore."

"This, then... Divine Doctor Wang, I'll remember this life-saving grace. If you need anything in the future, just say it!"

Xiao Chen had intended to keep pushing money toward Su Nantian but, upon seeing Su Nantian's determined and unyielding attitude, he had to give up.

However, Xiao Chen silently kept this gratitude in his heart and planned to help Su Nantian whenever he needed it.

Xiao Chen's gratitude for Su Nantian also increased significantly.

Xiao Chen and the villagers followed Su Nantian's instructions and left.

After they departed, Su Nantian returned to his room to find the elder.

"Wang Shu, I have something to ask you,"
Upon hearing Su Nantian's question, the elder immediately replied: "I know. You're asking about those villains, right?"

The elder had obviously heard the commotion at the door and guessed Su Nantian's intention without him needing to explain.

Su Nantian nodded immediately: "Yes, Wang Shu."

He did not beat around the bush but admitted it directly and continued: "I just want to know who these people are, why they're so arrogant, and why the villagers don't resist."

Although there were only dozens of households in the fishing village, totaling no more than 200 people, if they were determined to resist, these villains should not have had the upper hand.

Moreover, if they resisted, they wouldn't have to live in constant fear.
