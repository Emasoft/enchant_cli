He appeared puzzled, scanning up his arm before locking eyes with the cold security guard. The guard seemed to see an unfeeling pair of eyes, within which lay a sea of corpses and withered bones amidst swirling sand. He stood alone, bewildered in the despair, gradually decaying into nothingness.

In reality, Su Nantian had merely released a hint of killing intent. The temperature around them dropped slightly, causing everyone present to feel an eerie chill. Goosebumps erupted across their bodies, yet they looked around in confusion, unaware of what had transpired.

The only one who stood out was the guard who had locked eyes with Su Nantian. After a few seconds of eye contact, he suddenly let out a scream and collapsed to the ground, trembling uncontrollably as if his mind had snapped.

This unexpected turn of events surprised Cold Zhi Fei. He had intended to intimidate Su Nantian with a show of force, making him pass through the metal detector. Yet at this critical moment, someone had failed to follow orders—foolish!

Cold Zhi Fei waved his hand, and several guards rushed forward to help the fallen man. However, the man violently writhed free, pulling out a rubber baton and viciously beating his former comrades.

His terrified expression and desperate cries of "Don't come near me! Please, wait!" made the other guards feel a chill. For a moment, none of them dared to subdue him.

Cold Zhi Fei was furious, nearly ready to curse. But seeing Su Nantian's amused expression, he bit back his anger and forced a smile. "Sū Xiōng, don't worry. These matters will be handled properly. Let's go inside and talk," he said.

Su Nantian, pretending to ponder, replied, "His demeanor suggests supernatural interference. Are you certain your subordinates can handle it?"

Cold Zhi Fei felt a chill rising from his feet. Recalling the inexplicable coldness earlier, he forced a smile: "I-I think they can."

Su Nantian said nothing and walked through the metal detector without triggering any alarm.

This behavior slightly eased Cold Zhi Fei's nerves, though the process had been bumpy. At least the goal was achieved.

Unexpectedly, Su Nantian's arrogance was staggering—carrying no weapons at all, he dared to come for negotiations. Did he believe his martial arts skills made him invincible? Hmph!

Cold Zhi Fei personally opened the door to welcome Su Nantian inside. As he closed it, he gave his subordinates a signal to ensure the plan was foolproof.

Inside the villa, Su Nantian glanced around casually before sitting on the sofa without a care, waiting for Cold Zhi Fei's next move.

Seeing Su Nantian scrutinizing his home decor, Cold Zhi Fei inwardly cursed him for feigning humility. He hurried over to pour tea: "Sū Xiōng, this is my freshly brewed premium yellow bud tea. It's refreshing and invigorating—try it."

Su Nantian accepted the teacup, swirling it evenly. The tea leaves continuously churned and floated in the water, releasing a faint fragrance that drifted into his nostrils through the rising steam.

Though this tea couldn't compare to the exclusive supplies Su Nantian had obtained in the Dragon Group, it was still an exceptional brew within this city.

Su Nantian swirled the teacup and glanced at Cold Zhi Fei with a sideways look. "Do you usually drink this kind of tea?" he asked.

Cold Zhi Fei recognized Su Nantian's discernment and poured himself a cup, smiling: "Ah, how could I? This tea was secretly borrowed from my father!"

"Such a fine tea being stolen—would your father be angry?" Su Nantian asked casually.

Cold Zhi Fei chuckled, thinking that as long as he captured Su Nantian, it wouldn't matter if it was just a cup of tea. Even if he provided it daily, there would be no problem.

Su Nantian's indifferent expression left him speechless. He understood Cold Zhi Fei's mindset perfectly—this man believed the world revolved around him, that everyone should obey his will. Any slight inconvenience would provoke his anger, and he'd blame others for it. How could he possibly feel grateful for a small favor?

Thinking this, Su Nantian's desire to play with Cold Zhi Fei diminished further. He downed the tea in one gulp and said, "I have other matters to attend to. Please hand over Wen Liang now!"

Cold Zhi Fei smiled ambiguously after Su Nantian drank his tea. "Sū Xiōng, why the rush? Is there anything more important than chatting with your younger brother?"

His tone had returned to its usual sneering manner, prompting Su Nantian to frown slightly. He coldly replied, "What's there to discuss? Hand over Wen Liang immediately!"

Su Nantian's sudden cold demeanor annoyed Cold Zhi Fei. He vowed silently that once he captured Su Nantian, he'd sever his tendons and leave him crippled. He would also capture Wu You'er to humiliate her before Su Nantian's eyes, wondering what expression would appear on his face—despair or regret?

Hmph! This time I'll see how you escape my grasp!

Cold Zhi Fei stopped feigning smiles and adopted a serious demeanor. "I heard Sū Xiōng is a generous person. Now you're speaking plainly, so if there's something urgent, I'll cooperate to finish it quickly. Come, bring the writing utensils!"

From nowhere, a black-clad guard emerged and actually brought out brushes, ink, paper, and an inkstone. Before placing them on the table, Cold Zhi Fei scolded him harshly and beat him: "Bring writing utensils? You actually brought brushes and paper? You're truly talented. How did I raise such a useless fool..."

This crude trick was too clumsy. As soon as he said "bring writing utensils," someone brought them immediately—how could it not be pre-arranged? Su Nantian sat idly by, watching the scene without a word. After all, it was his subordinates being beaten, and it had nothing to do with him.

After scolding for a while without Su Nantian intervening, Cold Zhi Fei felt embarrassed. He turned to Su Nantian and said apologetically, "Sū Xiōng, forgive me. I didn't expect my subordinates to be so clueless. I'll have them bring better paper and brushes for you!"

Chapter 377: Who's the Fool?

Su Nantian shrugged indifferently. "It's a minor matter. I've always liked writing and painting, so it feels familiar..."

Cold Zhi Fei hadn't finished speaking when he feigned understanding. "Ah, I see. Sū Xiōng also has a talent for calligraphy. There's no need to waste time replacing the paper and brushes. In fact, I'd like to see your artistry. Why are you still standing there? Hurry up and lay out the paper and ink, you useless dog!"

Though these words were addressed to his subordinates, Cold Zhi Fei was facing Su Nantian, and the words carried subtle implications.

Su Nantian shrugged indifferently. After all, Cold Zhi Fei's intelligence was barely enough to rely on such underhanded tactics for trivial verbal victories.

Cold Zhi Fei was still proud of his small cleverness. He had previously investigated Su Nantian and knew he was merely Wu Tao's distant nephew. In short, a commoner skilled in martial arts—how could he possibly have learned calligraphy? His intention was to mock Su Nantian's clumsy handwriting.

The paper was yellowed and felt rough. When brought close, it smelled slightly damp—Cold Zhi Fei must have found this old paper from somewhere. This luxurious villa, yet he wouldn't spend a little money on such basics—truly eye-opening!

Su Nantian glanced at Cold Zhi Fei again, saying nothing. He carefully rolled up his sleeves and picked up an equally cheap brush, dipping it into the ink before preparing to write on the paper.

Cold Zhi Fei inwardly criticized his pretense but, seeing Su Nantian's confident demeanor, couldn't help approaching to watch.

Su Nantian focused entirely on his work. With a single stroke, the brush landed on the paper. The black ink soaked into the yellowed sheet, forming elegant characters with flowing strokes. At times, they seemed like startled mandarin ducks; at others, they were firm and powerful. The entire piece flowed effortlessly.

After finishing the calligraphy, Su Nantian exhaled and admired his work. This wasn't his peak performance but was still an excellent piece.

Cold Zhi Fei, who had been immersed in the art, finally snapped out of it. He never expected Su Nantian's calligraphy to be so outstanding.

Cold Zhi Fei had been forced by his parents to attend several art classes as a child. It was this opportunity that allowed him to learn calligraphy briefly. Because he had learned it, he knew how difficult it was—daily monotonous practice, practice, and more practice. After a long time, he could finally write legible characters. But at that point, Cold Zhi Fei had no desire to touch a brush again. The most notable feature was that he would vomit at the smell of ink.

He couldn't understand how Su Nantian, who was skilled in martial arts, had learned calligraphy. Moreover, it wasn't just good—it was incomparably superior to his own clumsy handwriting. It was like heaven and earth.

Su Nantian looked at Cold Zhi Fei with a half-smile. "How was it? Does my calligraphy meet your standards?"

Cold Zhi Fei forced a smile. "Ah, Sū Xiōng's calligraphy is truly remarkable. It's as if the Sage of Calligraphy himself had returned. I never expected you to be so skilled in calligraphy. Admiration, admiration... Ah..."

Su Nantian fanned the ink dry and smiled: "The Sage of Calligraphy is too much. I was just playing around. Perhaps it's comparable to a primary school student."

"Your modesty is commendable, Sū Xiōng."

Su Nantian glanced sideways at Cold Zhi Fei without responding. "I've seen your calligraphy. Now, can you bring Wen Liang here?"

Cold Zhi Fei's face stiffened. He was thinking about when the drug's effects would kick in. He shouted outside: "Bring Wen Liang here!"

"Come!"

With a loud bang, four black-clad guards carried the bound and gagged Wen Liang into the room. After Cold Zhi Fei's signal, they dropped him on the ground and retreated, leaving Wen Liang tied like a worm, crying "呜呜" at Su Nantian and Cold Zhi Fei.

Cold Zhi Fei ignored Wen Liang's pitiful state, smiling at Su Nantian: "Sū Xiōng, do you find this satisfactory?"

Su Nantian reluctantly nodded and stood up, walking across the creaking wooden floor toward Wen Liang.

Cold Zhi Fei said solemnly, "Wen Liang is now in your hands. However, our feud hasn't been resolved yet."

Su Nantian seemed to have heard a joke. "Wasn't it you who wanted to reconcile?"

His expression was clearly that of looking at a fool, both angry and amused.

Cold Zhi Fei stood frozen. Suddenly his expression turned fierce. He roared at Su Nantian, "Sū Nantian, don't be so arrogant. Do you believe I can kill you in a moment?"

Su Nantian shook his head slightly, as if seriously considering Cold Zhi Fei's question. After a moment, he replied earnestly: "I don't believe it!"

Cold Zhi Fei was furious. He repeatedly glanced at the teacup and then at Su Nantian. He had added some extra ingredients to the tea he gave Su Nantian. Now, it was about time for the drug's effects to kick in—but they hadn't yet.

Cold Zhi Fei wanted to provoke an early reaction but feared that before his men acted, he might be killed by Su Nantian. Thus, he found himself in a very awkward situation.

Su Nantian saw Cold Zhi Fei standing there and gave him a disdainful look before walking directly toward Wen Liang.

Wen Liang lay on the floor, his eyes filled with desperate pleading. He emitted muffled sounds.

Su Nantian calmly asked, "Do you have something to say? If so, nod your head."

Wen Liang nodded immediately.

Su Nantian understood but didn't remove the cloth from Wen Liang's mouth. To him, a dead man's words were all nonsense.

Without saying another word to Wen Liang, Su Nantian kicked him. Wen Liang groaned and slid across the floor, colliding with many decorations in the villa's living room.

Cold Zhi Fei was so angry his hands trembled. Yet he dared not stop Su Nantian from beating Wen Liang. He regretted bringing Wen Liang into the living room for the exchange and even more so for not carrying a gun, leaving himself in such a passive position.

Su Nantian calmly watched Wen Liang's painful struggle. As he was about to approach Wen Liang, the doors burst open, and numerous black-clad guards flooded in from upstairs and outside the living room.

Most of them carried sharp weapons, while a few held real guns. However, seeing Cold Zhi Fei and Su Nantian so close, they all stood frozen in place without moving forward.

Su Nantian looked at the group with confusion. Each time he glanced in a direction, the black-clad guards there instinctively took a step back. Finally, he looked at Cold Zhi Fei, who was closest to him, with a bewildered expression. This made Cold Zhi Fei tremble.

Damn it, why hasn't the drug taken effect yet?

"Ah, Sū Xiōng, please listen to me. The noise of you beating people is too loud. They're worried about our safety, so they came to check the situation," Cold Zhi Fei explained with a pained face.

He hadn't said "shatter the teacup" as a signal? Why had it been so easy to expose?

Why hadn't the drug's effects kicked in yet for Su Nantian? All of this made Cold Zhi Fei groan. Was today really a bad omen?

No, he still had a chance. Others were unreliable; he could rely on himself. Cold Zhi Fei estimated the drug's timing while trying to keep Su Nantian calm.

Su Nantian actually believed Cold Zhi Fei's explanation and nodded as if nothing had happened. "Oh, that's it. Then have them leave," he said.

"Yes, yes. Everyone, go back."

Actually, Cold Zhi Fei meant for the guards to return to their posts and stay on standby. However, his subordinates misunderstood and immediately withdrew!

This made him both angry and frustrated. Yet under Su Nantian's cold gaze, he was helpless. He could only watch his subordinates leave, cutting off one of his backdoors. Su Nantian was truly ruthless!

Within a minute, the guards had all left. The living room now only contained three people. Su Nantian's gaze moved from Cold Zhi Fei to the latter, lowering his opinion of him further. Ambitious yet lacking courage, still clinging to hope at this moment—truly pitiful and laughable.

Cold Zhi Fei noticed Su Nantian's strange gaze, as if he pitied him. His anger surged uncontrollably.

Under someone else's roof, one must bow their head. He had merely sent them away; it wasn't that he didn't have a counterattack plan. After his counterattack, see if you still had the right to sympathize!

Su Nantian approached Wen Liang and crouched down, mocking him. "Wen Liang, when you pushed your sister into the fire, did you ever think you'd be abandoned too?"

Wen Liang couldn't speak but stared at Su Nantian with eyes full of resentment, as if he were the one who had suffered injustice and oppression.

Su Nantian let out a cold laugh, removing the cloth from Wen Liang's mouth. "You seem不服气? I'd like to hear your brilliant ideas!"

Wen Liang removed the restraint from his mouth, feeling relieved. He spat out the blood in his mouth before speaking to Su Nantian with resentment: "Sū Nantian, I can't bear your brilliant ideas. I've been around for over twenty years; what methods and scenes haven't I seen? Today, my luck was bad, and I fell into your hands. Kill or maim me as you wish; no need to mock me so coldly!"

Su Nantian ran his fingers through his hair, pretending to be troubled. "Ah, so your meaning is that I caught you today because of bad luck?"

Wen Liang sneered and glared at Cold Zhi Fei, his meaning clear.

Su Nantian teased: "It seems you still have some unresolved grudges. Would you like me to give you time to resolve them?"

Before Wen Liang could speak, Cold Zhi Fei clapped his hands and laughed. "This is a good idea. Sū Xiōng can let him go, allowing this fellow to settle his private matters with me. I can also help Sū Xiōng teach him a lesson, so you don't have to dirty your hands!"

Cold Zhi Fei's intention was to find an opportunity to approach the sofa, as his gun was under one of the cushions.

Su Nantian slowly walked toward Cold Zhi Fei. As he passed the leather sofa, he reached inside and pulled out a gun. He opened the magazine and checked it—full of bullets!

"Ah, it's even a modified model. But can you handle it?"

This unexpected turn of events surprised Cold Zhi Fei again. His pale face grew even paler, and his sweat-soaked hands trembled.

He suddenly realized his sweat was excessive and might be noticed. He quickly wiped it on his expensive limited edition T-shirt.

Su Nantian took out the magazine and dropped each bullet onto the ground. Seeing Cold Zhi Fei wiping his hands, he said with a slight surprise: "Cold Zhi Fei, you still haven't realized it yet?"

Cold Zhi Fei's hand-wiping action froze. A bad feeling arose in his heart, and sweat poured down uncontrollably.

He feigned confusion and asked Su Nantian: "Sū Xiōng, what haven't you realized? You're talking about the gun, it's..."

Su Nantian interrupted without hesitation and earnestly said: "I must explain this to you so you can escape your unrealistic fantasies—that is, from the moment I entered, all your schemes were seen through by me!"

Cold Zhi Fei chuckled twice and then laughed heartily, patting his thighs while laughing at Su Nantian: "Sū Xiōng, you're really good at joking. I don't have any schemes, and it's really amusing to me."

"You still don't believe it? Alright, while time hasn't run out, I'll continue to explain. First, your show of force at the villa entrance—several guards who had never seen blood, thinking that wearing a suit and sunglasses with numbers could subdue me? Cold Zhi Fei, you're still too naive. How dare you come out to deal with me?"

Su Nantian harshly mocked Cold Zhi Fei, finding it amusing to see him unable to speak.

Cold Zhi Fei finally couldn't hold back. He looked up and said: "What good is your martial arts? My security personnel are numerous, and even if you're strong, can you dodge bullets?"

Su Nantian sneered: "You say they are numerous? Listen, who's here to help you?"

He said this and picked up the teacup on the table, smashing it onto the ground.

This smash made Cold Zhi Fei's heart jump. He couldn't help asking: "How did you know I...?"

"Shh, do you hear anyone?"

Su Nantian made a gesture to silence him. After a moment, there was no response.

Cold Zhi Fei hoped for the best and said: "This is just nonsense. They've already all left."

Chapter 379: Instant Reversal

The game was about to end. Su Nantian wouldn't give Cold Zhi Fei any more favors. He coldly asked: "They've left, so it's my fault? Who made you an idiot to use the teacup as a signal? Plus, your恶劣 attitude—your subordinates didn't kill you, it's already a miracle."

Cold Zhi Fei suddenly thought of something and asked Su Nantian: "So, after you entered the villa, did you already see through my plan?"

Su Nantian picked up the teapot and poured all the premium yellow bud tea onto the ground, mocking: "Exactly. Including your drug-laced tea!"

Cold Zhi Fei sighed inwardly, smartness had backfired. His anger turned into caution. He smiled bitterly and asked: "Why did you still drink it? Why was there nothing wrong after drinking?"

Su Nantian smiled mysteriously: "Come on, I came to this banquet. Do you think I'm stupid enough to drink the enemy's stuff? It was intentional to make you relax your guard, otherwise how would you have sent yourself to me? Besides, why do you think adding a little hallucinogen could make me fail?"

Cold Zhi Fei suddenly understood. That's why this guy hadn't had any problems after drinking tea! He had already seen something was wrong with the tea!

He took a deep breath and thought, who was this Su Nantian? From entering the villa to now, he had controlled every situation. It was terrifying!

He thought this and asked: "Since you've already seen through everything, why did you still act like a fool? Who are you really?"

Su Nantian was speechless: "Who am I? You've been against me for so long, and now you're asking me? Also, what did I do to act like a fool? Because I'm playing with you!"

"Because I'm playing with you!" These words entered Cold Zhi Fei's ears, making him shiver from head to toe.

Cold Zhi Fei had ordered his subordinates to beat people he didn't like into half-paralyzed, and he had hired people to insult others out of their hometown. But he hadn't seen Su Nantian's method of dealing with people—playing? What else did he plan to play?

Wen Liang laughed wildly: "Cold Zhi Fei, I've told you you'd regret it. The retribution came so fast. It's good that heaven has eyes, and I can see this scene. Truly, the cycle of karma is just!"

Su Nantian nodded in satisfaction and looked at Wen Liang. This wild laughter of Wen Liang annoyed him.

To match the current situation of Cold Zhi Fei, he decided to tell Wen Liang a good news, letting this kid and Cold Zhi Fei learn from each other to see who was more miserable!

"Wen Liang, since you're so happy, I'll tell you another good news to make you even happier!"

Wen Liang's laughter immediately stopped. He looked at Su Nantian with suspicion. Could this good news make him happy? Impossible!

Wen Liang refused: "Ah, I'm already happy. You don't need to tell me any more good news!"

"Chengqingya Yuan 1 building, 201 room!"

Su Nantian smiled lightly and said a address.

Wen Liang was stunned, quickly realizing: "What did you do to my wife? I tell you, Sū Nantian, if she has any problems, I'll fight with you to the death!"

Wen Liang's powerless threat was useless to Su Nantian, but it caught his attention. He had investigated Wen Liang's background with Zhang Bao. Upon investigation, he found that Wen Liang had several lovers. The address he mentioned was one of the places where Wen Liang kept his mistress.

"You wife? I only collected photos of you with your lovers. Your wife isn't home, so maybe she went out and wasn't caught by me," Su Nantian guessed with the worst intentions.

Wen Liang widened his eyes: "Lies, you haven't told me what happened to my wife yet?"

Su Nantian was surprised and patted Wen Liang's green head, sympathetically: "You were already doomed. But I changed my mind and decided to let you live a few more days because then you'd have the chance to learn some things you didn't know."

"What things?" Wen Liang hadn't finished asking when Su Nantian slapped him and knocked him out.

After dealing with Wen Liang, Su Nantian turned to Cold Zhi Fei.

Cold Zhi Fei was terrified and sat on the ground, trying to escape his gaze. His voice trembled: "Sū Nantian, don't go too far. My father is the chairman of Tihao Group. He won't let you off!"

Su Nantian seemed to remember something important and said: "Ah, right. I just remembered, the time is about up. Call your father, the chairman of the company! That's one of the reasons I came to drink tea!"

Cold Zhi Fei looked at him as if he were harmless, but his heart was cold. Had his last lifeline also failed?

"I... I call what phone?"

"Once you've made the call, you'll know. Hurry up; otherwise, you'll miss the main event. Or do you want me to help you?"

"No, no, I'll do it myself..." Cold Zhi Fei hurriedly ran to the sofa and dialed, also wisely turning on speakerphone.

"Hello?" a calm middle-aged man's voice came through.

"It's me, Dad. Dad?" Cold Zhi Fei called quickly.

"Is it Zhifei? What...?"

The conversation was cut off as a door opened.

"Who are you? How dare you enter my office?" Cold Boxiong asked in confusion.

"Sorry, Mr. Cold, someone reported you for tax evasion. Please come with us!"

"What? Did you make a mistake? I'm the chairman of..."

"Rest assured, Mr. Cold, we have solid evidence. Please come with us."

The voice grew distant. Cold Zhi Fei listened in silence as his father was taken away, and the phone gradually fell silent.

Su Nantian didn't care about Cold Zhi Fei's feelings. He casually picked up an apple from the coffee table, took a big bite and asked: "How was it? Cold Major, what score would you give for this grand performance I arranged?"

He hadn't called him "Major" before. Now, with Cold Zhi Fei's father in trouble, he mentioned it as "Major," clearly mocking!

Cold Zhi Fei slowly put down the phone and gradually turned his body. He managed to say a few words: "Sū, you're really ruthless!"

Su Nantian paused with the apple in his hand and smiled: "Hey, do you know how much effort I put into this performance? How much thought did I invest in making it happen at the same time as your phone call? Heh, you say I'm ruthless. Have you thought about what would happen to the Wu family after you defeated me?"

Chapter 380: Simple?

He had merely collected some evidence and had Zhang Bao report Cold Boxiong. However, it was still insufficient to bring down a business magnate. Su Nantian's goal was to strike at Cold Zhi Fei and break his psychological defense.

Cold Zhi Fei took a deep breath: "Alright, Sū Xiōng, you win. Tell me, what do you want to make me live? Money or something else—just say it!"

"Wow, just say it? Hmm, so strong?" Su Nantian feigned astonishment.

At this moment, a commotion was heard outside. The villa's living room door opened, and Zhang Bao, knowing there were only three people inside and that Su Nantian had controlled the situation, led the way in. He pointed a baton at Cold Zhi Fei with sharp eyes and coldness.

Su Nantian saw Cold Zhi Fei's tense expression and suddenly smiled: "But, I'm not against giving you a chance!"

Zhang Bao looked at Su Nantian and then Cold Zhi Fei, frowning: "Tian Ge, are you really giving this bastard a chance? Let my men take him away!"

Cold Zhi Fei estimated he couldn't escape, whether to be taken by Zhang Bao or continue playing with Su Nantian for a chance at survival. It seemed he had no choice.

"What's the game?"

Su Nantian picked up Cold Zhi Fei's small gun and said: "There's still one bullet in it. Take it and shoot me. If you hit me, you can leave freely, and no one will stop you!"

"Master Tian?"

Su Nantian gestured to stop Zhang Bao's call. Zhang Bao was reluctant but thought of something and started recording with his phone.

"Are you serious?" Cold Zhi Fei swallowed, nervously asked. He felt Su Nantian was like a madman.

"Yes, I'm serious. If you hit me, whether it's to kill or maim me, you can leave here openly. Zhang Bao will testify for me. But if you miss, your life is mine!"

Su Nantian's indifferent attitude seemed to have him confident.

"Okay, I accept!"

Cold Zhi Fei had already made up his mind. No matter if he could escape, he would definitely kill Su Nantian!

Su Nantian smiled and handed over the gun. He turned to leave, only to hear Zhang Bao shout: "Master Tian, be careful!"

Bang! The gun fired!

The scene left Cold Zhi Fei and Zhang Bao speechless.

As soon as Cold Zhi Fei grabbed the gun, he immediately shot at Su Nantian. But in that moment, something unbelievable happened.

It seemed as if Su Nantian had eyes at the back of his head, and he shifted his body to dodge the bullet!

Zhang Bao couldn't believe it. Cold Zhi Fei also couldn't believe it. How could Su Nantian have dodged a bullet? Could he move faster than the bullet?

Cold Zhi Fei exclaimed: "How is this possible?"

Su Nantian calmly turned around and took the gun from Cold Zhi Fei's trembling hand. He opened the magazine, which still had two bullets!

He showed them to Cold Zhi Fei and smiled, placing the two bullets from the magazine.

"Why did he lie to me? Why didn't I fire more shots?"

These questions lingered in Cold Zhi Fei's mind, never to be forgotten.

"Sorry, you're suspected of murder. Now it's my turn for self-defense," Su Nantian said calmly to Cold Zhi Fei, then notified Zhang Bao behind him.

Zhang Bao smiled and wisely stopped recording his phone.

"Ah, Master Tian, it's your call. If there's anything else, just let me know!" Zhang Bao smiled twice and left the living room.

Cold Zhi Fei watched Su Nantian about to beg for mercy. Su Nantian said nothing and approached him, punching his face.

He felt like a rock concert was playing in his head. Various noises echoed around him, and his mouth opened involuntarily, spitting out some food residue.

Su Nantian coldly said: "You were already dead. But I wanted your whole family to go together, so I collected some interest first. Be quiet and don't scream!"

A while later, the villa echoed with several screams before returning to silence.

Su Nantian opened the door and stepped out of the villa. Zhang Bao was waiting at the entrance. Seeing Su Nantian exit, he hurriedly approached.

"Zhang Bao, please have someone guard this villa. Don't let anyone approach it. Also, Wen Liang's injuries need treatment. Please arrange for him and Wen Liang to be together!"

"No problem, Master Tian. Is there anything else you need?"

Su Nantian thought for a moment: "Not yet. Also, thank you for helping me this time."

Zhang Bao smiled and waved: "Where's the need? I'm just helping Master Tian. With Master Tian's ability, this small matter is nothing!"

He exchanged a few more polite words with Zhang Bao and was about to leave.

Zhang Bao hesitated: "Master Tian, I have one question. If it's not too much trouble, I'd like Master Tian to explain it."

He smiled and said: "You want to know why Cold Zhi Fei shot at me, yet at such close range, he still missed?"

Zhang Bao nodded repeatedly and smiled: "After all, I'm in this business. I'm interested. Master Tian don't mind!"

Su Nantian smiled: "Actually, it's very simple. I humiliated him several times before giving him the gun. His accumulated anger was enough to kill me. After giving him the gun, he would definitely shoot immediately. I just dodged his direction at that moment!"

In fact, with Cold Zhi Fei's cruel nature, shooting from behind was obvious. Su Nantian had merely known someone would shoot him and taken evasive action in advance.

Why Zhang Bao could see Su Nantian's side movement was because Su Nantian's speed was fast enough to be invisible.

Zhang Bao's expression froze. This answer seemed simple, but it still required enough reaction time and courage. In other words, besides Su Nantian himself, this was hard to imitate!

"Uh, that's it?"

"Yes, that's it!"

Actually, there was an accidental reason that made Cold Zhi Fei miss.

Cold Zhi Fei had also drunk the tea with drugs to gain Su Nantian's trust. However, a small amount wouldn't have much effect.

Su Nantian constantly teased and threatened Cold Zhi Fei, making him sweat. This increased his blood circulation and metabolism, triggering the drug's effects early.

But these were minor details. Su Nantian didn't consider them at all. He relied solely on his confidence.

Now that he had the video of Cold Zhi Fei shooting at him, it would make Cold Boxiong hesitate. Then, if he wanted to save Cold Zhi Fei from his hands, Cold Boxiong would have no choice but to gather experts and face Su Nantian directly.

Chapter 381: The Challenge

And against martial arts, Su Nantian wouldn't fear anyone in Hangcheng!

After giving Zhang Bao some details, Su Nantian drove away from Cold Zhi Fei's villa and returned home.

As soon as he opened the door, a figure rushed toward him with a gust of fragrance.

"Alright, alright. I've taken care of everything. Don't worry."

Su Nantian comforted Wen Ran, who was crying and sobbing with a warm embrace to soothe her guilt.

"Let's just leave if it's no good. Let's go as far away from Hangcheng as possible!" After a while, Wen Ran wiped her eyes and said to Su Nantian.
