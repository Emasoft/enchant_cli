Su Nantian resolved within his heart, his expression equally resolute.

After contemplating this, Su Nantian immediately retraced his steps in the opposite direction of Li's departure. He was certain Wu You'er was imprisoned there.

Soon, Su Nantian confirmed his suspicion. After taking a few steps, he discovered an isolated small house ahead, surrounded by layers of security personnel.

From the sheer number alone, escape was impossible.

Yet precisely because of this overwhelming security, Su Nantian was even more certain Wu You'er was inside. His expression darkened instantly.

But soon, Su Nantian faced a new problem. Though he now knew Wu You'er was imprisoned there, the security surrounding the house was impenetrable—every angle meticulously guarded with no blind spots.

Even if he wished to enter, rushing in recklessly was impossible.

Su Nantian stared at the black mass of security personnel, his mood plummeting. He didn’t know what to do.

Was this another failure?

But tomorrow was the wetland bidding conference. If Wu You'er wasn’t rescued, she might face danger!

This thought made Su Nantian’s expression even graver.

What should he do?

He pondered irritably in his mind.

Should he really force his way in?

Otherwise, delaying further would make it even harder to infiltrate Wu’s estate for information.

Moreover, Li had already scrutinized Nan Gong Ping’s actions and harbored suspicions. If he delayed further, it might provoke more trouble.

Realizing this, Su Nantian clenched his fists tightly and gazed again at the security personnel guarding the entrance.

He knew that after that night’s reckless move, Wu’s people and these security forces would be even more vigilant.

Indeed, they kept moving without pause. Not only that, but they had no break shifts—three teams or more were always on duty, meaning twenty-four hours of unwavering vigilance. There was no opening for him to exploit.

With this in mind, Su Nantian resolved: he would fight. He could no longer delay.

Let’s do it!

After clarifying his thoughts, Su Nantian no longer hesitated. He first created a diversion in the opposite direction, drawing some security personnel away. Then he repeated the tactic—but this time, they seemed to have learned from their previous mistake.

When he first created a commotion, they reacted and sent a small squad to investigate. But when the second noise occurred, they took no action, merely watching the direction with vigilance.

“Last time’s security already warned us! That intruder used this method to divert our attention. So no matter what sound there is, we must stay here!”

The security commander spoke, scanning the surroundings with caution.

“Li Assistant said this was a fortress of iron and steel, with no gaps—even flies couldn’t enter. So we only need to guard this entrance. No matter how skilled the opponent is, they can’t break through!”

The security commander continued, implying that they only needed to guard this spot. The rest was irrelevant.

“Understood, commander!”

The other security personnel nodded immediately, not daring to make any mistakes. All were highly alert at the entrance.

Su Nantian observed their vigilance and sighed inwardly.

It was clear that the same trick couldn’t be used twice—no one would fall for it again.

After clarifying this, Su Nantian stepped out of his hiding place. He decided to force his way in. After all, this confrontation was inevitable, and time had dragged on too long—he couldn’t risk leaving Wu You'er in the Wu estate.

With this thought, Su Nantian leapt from his hiding spot.

“Saw him! There!”

The security personnel immediately heard the commotion Su Nantian caused. They all turned, staring at him and preparing to attack.

When the security commander saw Su Nantian appear, he immediately wore a delighted expression: “Quick! Divide into two teams. You guard the entrance! We’ll go capture him! Remember, stay here—don’t let him use a diversion to lure us away!”

The commander was worried Su Nantian might have accomplices, hence the warning.

The security personnel responded immediately, confirming they had heard.

Soon, they split into two groups: one to surround Su Nantian, the other to guard the entrance as ordered.

The commander also contacted others via radio, quickly notifying Wu Chuan and Li Assistant.

This time, they couldn’t let anyone escape! Otherwise, their security department would be completely dismissed.

After this thought, the commander felt his blood boil, his cells alive with energy. He had to capture Su Nantian and clear his name!

Faced with their pursuit, Su Nantian showed no fear. His face bore not a trace of terror, as if they were insignificant.

Chapter 741: Successful Breakthrough

His movements were incredibly swift, and before the security personnel could react, he had already taken down half of them.

“Damn it! Stop him at all costs! Don’t let him reach the safe room!”

The commander, seeing his men already half-dead, shouted angrily and ordered everyone to block Su Nantian.

He couldn’t let Su Nantian get through again!

At the same time, he kept contacting for reinforcements via radio.

Su Nantian realized they were in chaos and heard the commander requesting backup. He knew he couldn’t delay any longer.

This was the best opportunity!

So Su Nantian accelerated his actions, aiming for a swift victory.

Soon, he reached the entrance.

The security personnel guarding the door hadn’t expected Su Nantian’s speed or how easily he had broken through the encirclement. They rushed to attack him, but they too were quickly taken down by Su Nantian.

They clearly knew their strength was no match for his, and they even thought Su Nantian hadn’t used his full power.

Thinking of this, their faces grew even more anxious.

If Su Nantian hadn’t used his full strength and they still couldn’t withstand him, what would happen if he did?

“That’s enough! Open the door!”

Su Nantian quickly disposed of the security personnel guarding the entrance. Their level was incomparable to his, so he acted swiftly.

After defeating them, Su Nantian grabbed one of the security personnel and demanded he open the door.

The security officer shook his head: “No way—we can’t open it.”

They had already been defeated. If they opened the door and let Wu You'er out, they would have no place left to stand!

So this officer refused to open it.

“Is that so?”

Su Nantian raised an eyebrow, smiling as if hearing a joke. “I’ll count to three. If you don’t open the door, I won’t hesitate to act.”

In desperation, Su Nantian didn’t care anymore. After all, he had already decided to force his way in and revealed his identity openly during the day.

This time, he couldn’t fail at this door!

Thinking of this, Su Nantian spoke coldly, his tone threatening and his eyes serious—no joke.

The security officer trembled all over, his feet cold with fear but still dared not open the door.

“Three… two…”

Su Nantian began counting, his hand slowly tightening around the security officer’s neck. His meaning was clear: if the officer didn’t open the door, he had no reason to live.

The security officer felt his breath weaken and his neck’s grip tighten. He had already tasted the agony of suffocation.

When one is on the brink of death, only instinct remains. So this officer couldn’t hold back any longer and shouted: “It’s not that I don’t want to open it—I have no key. Only the commander has one! Truly, only he does!”

“Fool!”

At this moment, the security commander was secretly contacting reinforcements. He hadn’t expected his subordinate to betray him first. He cursed under his breath and immediately ran in the opposite direction, determined not to let the key fall into Su Nantian’s hands.

But the commander hadn’t taken two steps when Su Nantian, like a ghost, moved swiftly and appeared before him.

“Is this the key?”

Su Nantian directly reached out and took all the keys from the commander’s waist.

The commander hadn’t even reacted, and when he regained his senses, he stared at Su Nantian in shock.

“Give me back the key! You can’t open that door!”

The commander immediately widened his eyes and lunged forward to snatch the key from Su Nantian.

After obtaining the keys, Su Nantian had no time to deal with these people. He pushed the commander aside and continued to open the door.

“Is it you!”

At this moment, Su Nantian was focused on opening the door. A familiar voice behind him made him pause and turn around—only to find Li Assistant.

Li Assistant hadn’t expected this either. His eyes widened, and he remained stunned for a long time.

Su Nantian saw Li Assistant and felt an instinctive unease, quickening his door-opening actions.

He had originally hoped to rescue Wu You'er quickly and avoid being discovered by the Wu family, but he hadn’t expected Li Assistant to return.

Li Assistant felt just as shocked as Su Nantian.

He had suddenly remembered something and returned to check on it, but he hadn’t expected to witness this shocking scene.

Indeed, the person who had come to rescue Wu You'er was Su Nantian!

Su Nantian had been a traitor all along within the Wu family!

“Is it you!”

Li Assistant spoke again, his tone cold and his expression dark. He could never have imagined that the person who had been trying to rescue Wu You'er was right under their noses.

“And you are…?”

Li Assistant demanded, his voice sharp: “Why did you come to the Wu family to rescue Wu You'er? What’s your real intention!”

He added, “I never thought you were a traitor! You were the one who broke in last night, wasn’t you!”

“Yes, it was me.”

Su Nantian hadn’t expected to be discovered, but what could he do?

Since it was already exposed, there was no need to hide. He spoke openly and confidently.

His gaze toward Li Assistant was indifferent.

“You dare to admit it!”

Li Assistant hadn’t expected Su Nantian to remain so calm after being caught. He spoke again, his eyes now fierce and threatening.

Chapter 742: Exposure

“Tell me—what are you!”

Li Assistant continued to interrogate Su Nantian, demanding a convincing explanation.

After saying this, Li Assistant immediately questioned Su Nantian again: “Oh right! You’ve never truly submitted to our Wu family, nor to the master. You only pretended to agree but actually worked for the Nan Gong family!”

Thinking of this, Li Assistant looked shocked.

Especially thinking they had been deceived by Su Nantian all this time and trusted him blindly, Li Assistant felt even more bewildered.

“Now I understand why Nan Gong’s young master came to visit so early—this was your plan!”

Li Assistant continued to speculate, his eyes widening at the thought: “You wait—when the master learns you’ve deceived him, he’ll definitely punish you!”

“Ah.”

Su Nantian only lightly replied with an “ah,” as if Li Assistant’s countless speculations were meaningless.

“You!”

Li Assistant was enraged by Su Nantian’s attitude, his face turning even more unpleasant. He hadn’t expected Su Nantian to remain so calm after being exposed.

Didn’t Su Nantian feel the slightest guilt or fear!

Su Nantian continued to open the door, ignoring Li Assistant and those behind him.

“Why are you still standing there? Hurry up and catch this arrogant brat!”

Li Assistant roared, thinking of how they had been deceived by Su Nantian all this time. He felt a burning anger in his gut, thinking of how Su Nantian might have laughed at them behind their backs.

“Yes!”

After being scolded by Li Assistant, the security personnel finally understood and grabbed their weapons again. They rushed toward Su Nantian to block him.

“Open.”

At this moment, Su Nantian had already unlocked the safe room. He raised an eyebrow and smiled lightly before quickly stepping inside.

As he closed the door, he even taunted: “You all wait patiently!”

After rescuing Wu You'er, he would return to headquarters for a report. He had no time to waste with these people!

Moreover, after removing his fake skin mask, he was sure they couldn’t find him.

After thinking this through, Su Nantian was even more eager to rescue Wu You'er and free her from suffering.

“What’s that noise outside? Why is it so noisy?”

At this moment, the security personnel inside the safe room noticed the commotion outside. They looked at each other in confusion, exchanging glances to inquire.

“You stay here; I’ll go check.”

One of the security personnel spoke.

Li Assistant had repeatedly warned them not to leave, insisting they must keep one person guarding Wu You'er. Otherwise, if anything happened, there would be no chance to recover.

So these security personnel always remembered Li Assistant’s warning and dared not defy him at this moment.

“You go quickly.”

The other security personnel nodded immediately, assuring the one who stayed behind.

After that person left, Wu You'er suddenly blinked at the security officer and tried to speak: “Mmm… mmm!”

She remembered that when Li Assistant had forced her to eat, this security officer was the first to look away. This indicated he was the softest one.

Although Wu You'er knew it was impossible to persuade him to let her go, she still wanted to try.

She didn’t want to give up without even trying!

After thinking this through, Wu You'er continued to make noise and draw his attention.

“Miss Wu?”

Soon, the security officer noticed her and looked down at her with confusion: “What do you want?”

“Mmm! Mmm!”

Wu You'er saw he had responded to her, confirming he was indeed different from the one who had left.

This gave her infinite hope—this meant she could take a gamble!

Thinking of this, Wu You'er spoke even more insistently and used her eyes to signal him.

This security officer frowned, reluctant to respond to Wu You'er. He was worried about unexpected changes but saw this beautiful woman tied up and abused, so he felt pity.

“Let me take off the tape; you must stay quiet and not make a sound.”

This security officer thought for a moment, then hesitated to say: “You mustn’t make noise. I’ll let you breathe for a while and tape it back.”

Wu You'er heard this, her eyes lit up. She nodded vigorously, as if afraid he might change his mind.

The security officer saw Wu You'er nod and slowly removed the tape from her mouth.

“Huh—”

As soon as she was free, Wu You'er took a deep breath and felt relieved.

“Thank you.”

She sincerely thanked him, but her voice was hoarse from dehydration.

“Drink some water.”

The security officer heard this and felt even more pity, bringing her water to moisten her throat.

Wu You'er had been thinking all along and, seeing how easily this person was soft-hearted, she quickly made a decision.

“I’ve been tied up here for two days; my legs are completely numb.”

Wu You'er spoke with a crying tone, looking pitiful to stir his sympathy and protectiveness.

“Can you untie my legs? Just for a little while; when that man comes back, you can tie me up again.”

Wu You'er continued to beg: “Please, just for a little while. My legs are numb.”

“B-but…”

The security officer hesitated when hearing Wu You'er’s request, worried she might escape. But seeing her tearful and beautiful face, he couldn’t bring himself to say no.

“Please…”

“Okay, but when he comes back, you must tie me up again.”

This security officer finally gave in to Wu You'er’s charm and untied her legs.

“Thank you.”

Wu You'er thanked him again earnestly.

Then she suddenly moved her body: “Oh, there’s a little bug crawling on my back. It’s so itchy. Can you check for me?”

“That’s not good, is it?”

The security officer was startled but thought of the difference between men and women. He immediately shook his head.

“Just help me, I can’t do anything with my hands tied up.”

Wu You'er continued to beg him with a pitiful tone and looked at him with tears in her eyes: “I don’t mind. Please help me, okay?”

“Okay.”

The security officer once again fell to Wu You'er’s begging eyes. He bent down and reached out to check for bugs on her back.

At this moment, Wu You'er whispered: “I’m sorry.”

“Huh?”

As the security officer was confused, Wu You'er suddenly lifted her head and smashed it into his. At the same time, she kicked him hard with her feet.

The security officer was knocked dizzy and then received another powerful kick, falling to the ground and hitting his head on the floor. He was completely knocked out.

“I’m truly sorry; I had no other choice.”

Wu You'er knew that this person had been soft-hearted toward her and helped her. Her current action was essentially repaying kindness with betrayal.

But Wu You'er had understood from Li Assistant’s reaction that her status was no longer what it used to be. Wu Chuan had clearly stated she was now a discarded child.

If she stayed here, she would definitely become Wu Chuan’s target for venting his anger. Perhaps even Li Assistant’s.

So thinking of this, Wu You'er had no choice but to take a risk.

Now time was limited, and the security officer who had gone out to check would return at any moment. Wu You'er couldn’t waste time here.

She glanced back at the security officer lying on the ground and didn’t care about her forehead’s swelling. She hurriedly ran out.

To be honest, Wu You'er was grateful to Li Assistant for forcing her to eat at noon. Otherwise, if she had continued to refuse food and starve herself, she wouldn’t have the strength to escape now.

Wu You'er pushed aside all chaotic thoughts and focused on one strong belief: she had to escape quickly.

“Ah!”

At this moment, Wu You'er saw a figure at the corner of the corridor and screamed in fear. Her face turned pale immediately.

Had she struggled so hard to escape, only to fail to leave the safe room?

Why had she tried so hard then!

Wu You'er felt heavy-hearted, her heart sinking again and again.

“Wu You'er!”

At this moment, the person at the corner had thought it was another security officer from Wu’s family and prepared to fight. But upon closer inspection, he saw it was Wu You'er standing at the entrance.

Su Nantian immediately spoke, his voice slightly surprised.

“Su Nantian!”

Compared to Su Nantian’s slight surprise, Wu You'er’s reaction was a shocking joy!

She first cried out his name and then rushed toward him, throwing herself into his arms.

“How did you come?”

In the time it took for Wu You'er to say this, her tears couldn’t stop flowing. Her voice was clearly crying.

Her tears fell onto Su Nantian’s chest, warm and moist, making Su Nantian feel心疼 for Wu You'er.

He knew that since Wu You'er had been forcibly taken back by Wu Chuan, she hadn’t experienced a single day without suffering.

“Everything’s fine now; I’ve come to take you.”

Su Nantian, for once, softened his tone and spoke gently to Wu You'er.

He patted her head with his hand, using this action to comfort her.

“You came! That’s great!”

When Wu You'er heard this, her tears became even more.

She had been so afraid before, worried that the person at the corner would be Wu Chuan’s security. Her nerves were all tense, even forgetting to breathe.

She couldn’t imagine what would happen if she was caught by Wu Chuan’s people again, how desperate she would feel.

So it was fortunate that the person who came was Su Nantian!

“But how did you come?”

Wu You'er suddenly looked up at Su Nantian, surprised and confused: “It’s daytime now. If they saw you, wouldn’t they notice?”

Last time it was night and Su Nantian had left quickly. Wu You'er hadn’t revealed his identity, so the Wu family didn’t know who he was.

But now it was daytime. If they saw Su Nantian’s face, what would happen?

Thinking of this, Wu You'er immediately became anxious.

“They’ve already seen.”

Su Nantian saw Wu You'er’s expression and knew what she was thinking. He spoke softly, then quickly cut her off before she could speak: “Don’t worry; they can’t do anything to me. Besides, now that I’ve taken you out, the Wu family has nothing to do with me.”

When Wu You'er heard this, she slightly relaxed but quickly became anxious again: “This is too risky! You shouldn’t have done this!”

“I couldn’t wait any longer. The wetland bidding conference is coming soon, and Wu Chuan will act against you.”

At this moment, Su Nantian noticed Wu You'er’s hands were still tied. He helped untie them while explaining why he had come, then said: “There are many people outside. Don’t say anything or do anything; I’ll take you out.”

“Su Nantian, why have you always helped me? Is it because of your mission or…”

Wu You'er suddenly spoke softly.

“What?”

Su Nantian, preoccupied with planning their escape, hadn’t noticed what Wu You'er had said.

“Nothing.”

Wu You'er smiled and shook her head.

It didn’t matter what the reason was.

No matter why Su Nantian had come to rescue her, he had arrived.

That was enough.

Chapter 744: Escape Plan

“Stay calm and follow me.”

Su Nantian looked at Wu You'er, though he didn’t know what she had said, he had no time to care about such trivial matters.

He gave her a brief instruction and looked at her small face with concern.

Su Nantian had always regarded Wu You'er as his younger sister. Seeing her weakened and frail from Wu Chuan’s torment, he felt both心疼 and anger.

After taking her out, Su Nantian would definitely punish Wu Chuan!

“Okay.”

Wu You'er had originally wanted to tell Su Nantian to leave first and wait for her parents, but seeing his determined gaze, she felt she couldn’t say that.

Moreover, Wu You'er thought that since Su Nantian had come to rescue her, he would definitely not leave her parents behind. She needed to trust Su Nantian completely.

“Follow me.”

Su Nantian had prepared for Wu You'er to refuse again, but she didn’t say anything and simply agreed.

He was slightly stunned, then gave her a brief instruction.

At the same time, those outside the safe room were extremely anxious.

Especially Li Assistant, who was pacing back and forth in desperation, ready to explode.

“How long are you going to take? You’ve all been here for so long, and it’s just a door!”

Li Assistant was desperate, constantly pacing back and forth. He felt like he would explode.

“Move faster! Hurry up and get in! I don’t know what Su Nantian is doing inside!”

Li Assistant continued to urge the security personnel, his anxiety growing. He thought of Su Nantian breaking through their encirclement and entering the room, like a ant on a hot pan.

It had been ten minutes since Su Nantian entered, but they were still arguing over the door and couldn’t move it an inch.

Seeing this scene, how could Li Assistant stay calm?

He only continued to urge the security commander, ordering him to act quickly and not make any mistakes.

The security commander was also extremely anxious. He ran over to Li Assistant and explained: “Li Assistant, you’re mistaken—we’ve done everything. This is Wu Chuan’s safe door! It’s impregnable and has no way in except with the key!”

The security commander said this while showing his anxiety: “Now that Su Nantian has taken the key, we have no way to proceed!”

This major incident made the security commander wish he could rush in immediately and reclaim Wu You'er.

But what could they do? Facing this door, they were truly helpless and could only wait anxiously outside.

“Ah! You have to think of another way quickly! Don’t just say there’s no key and do nothing!”

Li Assistant heard the security commander’s words and became even more anxious. He immediately urged him again, then looked at him with a scolding expression: “You all! You’ve been given so many people and told to be careful. But what happened? You couldn’t catch Su Nantian! You’re all useless!”

At this moment, Li Assistant was truly angry. He cursed them for causing trouble.

If Wu Chuan found out, he would definitely punish him!

The security commander could only bear the anger silently. He knew they were at fault and couldn’t dare to argue back.

But in his heart, he muttered: If you had the ability, why didn’t you discover Su Nantian was a traitor earlier? If it had been discovered earlier, this wouldn’t have happened.

Of course, these words were only for his own satisfaction; he wasn’t foolish enough to say them aloud in front of Li Assistant.

“Fine, you continue to open the door and assign more people to guard it. I don’t believe there’s no other exit inside—he can’t fly away!”

Li Assistant thought for a moment and came up with a plan. He believed that since there was only one door, even if Su Nantian had entered successfully, he would have to come out through this door. He couldn’t live in there forever.

After thinking of this, Li Assistant ordered the security commander to assign more people to guard it and ensure they intercepted Su Nantian when he came out.

The security commander also understood this logic and nodded immediately, saying “yes” repeatedly without any resistance.

Li Assistant looked at him deeply and said: “This time, you must guard it well. If there’s even a slight mistake, I won’t be able to protect you!”

After saying this, Li Assistant quickly turned around and went to inform Wu Chuan. After such a major event, he couldn’t make the decision alone and had to let Wu Chuan handle it.

“What did you say?”

Li Assistant didn’t dare to waste any time and hurried back, not even noticing Nan Gong Ping was still sitting there. He immediately told Wu Chuan that Su Nantian was the traitor among them and had already entered the safe room.

Wu Chuan, upon hearing Li Assistant’s report, immediately stood up and slammed the table. He shouted: “Li Assistant, are you sure it was Su Nantian?”

This answer was something he couldn’t accept.

“Sir, I’m sure it was him. This is too important to lie about. It really was Su Nantian!”

Li Assistant reported anxiously to Wu Chuan, understanding why Wu Chuan was so shocked. He himself couldn’t believe it either when he realized the traitor was Su Nantian.

“Really, sir.”

Li Assistant said again and told Wu Chuan: “Sir, Su Nantian is now trapped in the safe room. There are only two people inside—him and Miss Wu. Please come see for yourself!”

If they delayed any longer, Li Assistant was worried Su Nantian might have already escaped with Wu You'er.

After all, based on Su Nantian’s abilities just now, he might have already broken out.

Thinking of this, Li Assistant’s expression also showed some urgency. He couldn’t afford to waste any time.

Chapter 745: Confrontation
