They had not yet fully grasped the gravity of their situation when a flicker of panic crossed their faces, though it was fleeting. Yet Su Nantian had seen it clearly.

Thus, he knew their identities were not as simple as they seemed. No one would dare show fear upon encountering those he had recruited.

But since they refused to speak the truth, Su Nantian scrutinized their words for inconsistencies, hoping to uncover his own identity.

“He is one of the top figures in Inland Port. We are a prominent family from M City. Naturally, we have competition with him, and we wish to expand our business there.”

Once Xu Hai had spoken his excuse, his mind quickly connected the dots.

“We were at a loss over how to deal with Wuchuan, but you’ve resolved it. Truly, you are a great benefactor to the Xu family.”

Xu Hai had composed his expression and smiled as he replied.

“Ah, I see.”

Su Nantian nodded solemnly in response.

But the next moment, his expression shifted. He let out a cold laugh: “Do you think I am a fool? Or do you believe you can deceive me so easily?”

They had all witnessed Su Nantian’s prowess before. Now, seeing him suddenly confront them, they were all startled and stared at him in fear, unsure of what had changed.

“You said you sought me out, saw my talent, and wished to recruit me into your Xu family.”

Su Nantian spoke coldly. “If it were truly so simple, why would you have sent so many people to find me?”

Moreover, the individuals they had dispatched were clearly intent on killing him.

Su Nantian recalled what Master Hong had once said: that he and the Xu family bore a grudge, and Hong had interjected to claim his share.

If that were the case, then their relationship was purely one of enmity.

It was possible they had spoken the truth about Wuchuan being the key to this mystery.

Su Nantian’s thoughts raced, swiftly piecing together all he had learned so far.

And he was correct—there truly existed a grudge between the Xu family and himself. They were certainly not merely seeking to lure him back as their subordinate.

After speaking these words, Su Nantian suddenly lunged forward and seized Xu Hai’s throat. “Do not attempt to deceive me.”

“Otherwise, you will learn the consequences of mocking me.”

Su Nantian narrowed his eyes and issued a cold warning.

“Hiss—”

Xu Hai immediately inhaled sharply.

“Speak up! What is your relationship with Wuchuan?”

Su Nantian pressed further, watching Xu Hai tremble in fear and dare not speak.

Chapter 879: Disciplining the Xu Family

“Speak freely. If your words differ from what I know, you will know your fate.”

At this point, Su Nantian had already discerned their deceit through their expressions. Thus, he issued this warning and was reminding the Xu family that this was their only chance.

If they truthfully revealed everything, Su Nantian would assess their intentions and decide whether to eliminate them.

But if they continued to fabricate lies, he would not show mercy.

After issuing this warning, Su Nantian coldly observed the Xu family, letting them weigh their own worth.

He had long since learned to be ruthless toward enemies and would not allow himself to be deceived again.

Unavoidably, Su Nantian’s words had even startled Madam Xu, who had long held power in M City. No one had ever dared speak to her with such a tone before, and this was beyond anything she had experienced.

Xu Hai and Xu Tian’s expressions changed instantly; they naturally knew their words were lies. After all, the opponent was so formidable that even the experts they had hired at great expense could not subdue Su Nantian. Not only that, but they had failed to threaten him and were all eliminated by Su Nantian.

They had seen the entire scene on the surveillance footage clearly, and if Su Nantian hadn’t been toying with Captain Qiu, his movements would have been even more efficient.

And at this moment, they had no other means to counter Su Nantian, so they could only avoid his wrath.

That was why Xu Hai had devised a plan to stall time, hoping to momentarily divert Su Nantian’s attention and give them space to think.

But now, seeing Su Nantian’s expression, he realized he had made a dangerous move.

Su Nantian’s martial prowess and intelligence were both formidable.

“You jest, but how could we dare deceive you? This is the truth—because you killed Wuchuan, we asked for your help.”

Xu Hai chuckled again, trying to smooth things over. Yet his words still clung to the same claim and refused to reveal the truth to Su Nantian.

Xu Hai seemed to believe that if they persisted in their lies, Su Nantian would truly find no way forward.

“Do you not know who I am?”

At this moment, Su Nantian spoke coldly, deliberately provoking Xu Hai to extract information about his past from their words.

“You… we know little about you. We only know that you were once a bodyguard for the Nan Gong family.”

Xu Hai hesitated but finally confessed. When they had learned that Su Nantian had killed Wuchuan, they had sent people to investigate his true identity.

Unfortunately, despite expending all their resources, they had only found the public identity Su Nantian had revealed—his birth and previous records.

Beyond that, they had never uncovered his roots.

Thus, Xu Hai revealed all the truth to Su Nantian, knowing they could not oppose someone as formidable as him. Now, he only hoped Su Nantian would believe them and let them go.

And this half-truth approach was indeed easier to deceive others.

Bodyguard?

Su Nantian mused in his mind, pondering deeply. Yet the more he thought, the more it felt wrong—could he truly have been merely a bodyguard?

It was not that Su Nantian looked down on the profession of a bodyguard, but if he had truly been one, how could his abilities be so extraordinary? This level of power was beyond any bodyguard.

Moreover, Su Nantian had already fought with Captain Qiu and his men.

From their words, he knew the Xu family held a significant position in M City, and Captain Qiu had been hired at great expense.

Yet their abilities were no more than this, and they paled in comparison to his own.

That was why Su Nantian felt puzzled.

And what of the Nan Gong family? Who were they, and why had he worked as their bodyguard?

Su Nantian had not expected that his attempt to uncover information about himself from the Xu family would result in them knowing little more than he did.

It seemed they had only a superficial understanding of him.

Moreover, from their words, Su Nantian found other inconsistencies, which deepened his suspicions.

This was all too strange.

The more Su Nantian pondered, the more his doubts multiplied.

And most importantly, he had not yet resolved these suspicions; instead, they piled up endlessly, leaving him at a loss.

He also dared not ask further questions, fearing he might reveal himself before the Xu family and let them catch on to some clues.

But their previous statement was one he absolutely did not believe, for no one would send people to kill someone they wished to recruit.

Yet the truth behind this remained unclear and required further investigation.

Moreover, Su Nantian knew he needed to visit another place before confirming his identity. That place was the Nan Gong family, which they had just mentioned. He would see what abilities they truly possessed and why he had worked as their bodyguard.

After thinking this through, Su Nantian quickly composed his expression and cast a warning glance at the Xu family.

At this moment, he was only temporarily believing their explanation and had no other reason to disbelieve them.

But this did not mean he truly trusted them; on the contrary, he still harbored many suspicions.

However, for now, it was useful to keep them alive, so he had not yet acted against them.

After this, Su Nantian decided to go to the Nan Gong family first.

After all, whether he had truly been a bodyguard or held another identity, he could find the information he sought there.

“I will temporarily let you go.”

After thinking this through, Su Nantian finally spoke.

When he said these words, the three of them immediately sighed in relief, as if they had narrowly escaped a disaster.

But they did not have long to celebrate; Su Nantian’s expression changed again, and his gaze grew colder.

Chapter 880: Uncovering the Truth

Su Nantian quickly continued, “Once I clarify your relationship with Wuchuan, you will know the fate of those who deceive me.”

“You had better not play games.”

After saying this, Su Nantian gazed at them deeply. That gaze seemed to have already penetrated their souls.

When the Xu family heard Su Nantian’s words, they shuddered slightly. Seeing this, Su Nantian was satisfied and withdrew his gaze, then said: “You may run away if you wish. But you know my abilities—no matter how far you go, I will find you. And the fury you face then will be a hundredfold greater than now.”

This statement was both sincere and meant to intimidate the Xu family, making them understand his power and not dare to flee.

If they truly were foolish enough to run, he would definitely find them.

And when he did, he would make them remember this pain forever, just as he had promised.

“You jest. How could we run? We are waiting for you here, and we hope you will join our Xu family.”

Xu Hai shuddered slightly and quickly replied to Su Nantian, gazing at him with a fawning expression as if he truly wished to welcome Su Nantian as their honored guest.

But Su Nantian knew they were merely using this as a temporary measure to calm his emotions. He had other plans now, and thus he did not refuse their offer but took the opportunity to retreat gracefully.

“Make sure you remember your words and do not attempt to mock me.”

Su Nantian gave a final warning before swiftly turning around. With a light kick of his foot, he vanished into the night.

“Mother!”

As Su Nantian had just left, Madam Xu dropped her cane. She did not know why, but when facing Su Nantian, she felt a spiritual submission, as if she had already known she could not overcome someone of his abilities.

Moreover, she was old and had endured this spiritual pressure for so long; it was truly taxing.

She nearly collapsed, but Xu Hai and Xu Tian quickly caught her. Otherwise, her frail bones would have suffered a severe fall.

“Mother, are you alright?”

After Xu Hai and Xu Tian supported Madam Xu, they asked with concern and watched her worriedly.

“I am fine. But I fear our Xu family may have great problems.”

Madam Xu leaned on their arms and slowly stood upright, then adjusted her cane. Her face showed a worried expression—something Xu Hai and Xu Tian had never seen on their mother before. If they hadn’t known the situation, they might have thought they were seeing things wrong.

“Mother, let’s run! I don’t believe Su Nantian has such supernatural abilities!”

Xu Hai quickly grabbed Madam Xu’s hand and said, “He will surely return eventually. Once he clarifies our relationship with Wuchuan, he will definitely come back. I think he won’t let this go easily.”

Xu Hai quickly urged Madam Xu to leave with him: “Mother! We should escape this place early. Just hide for a while.”

Xu Tian, upon hearing this, nodded immediately: “Yes, Mother. We should flee quickly. I don’t believe he can truly find us!”

Xu Tian added, “Moreover, our Xu family has deep roots. We can rebuild anywhere. Mother doesn’t need to worry about this.”

Madam Xu listened but did not immediately respond. Instead, she looked back at the plaque behind her that read “Xu Family.”

The Xu family had stood unshaken in An City for years. After all the ups and downs, it still remained firm. Madam Xu had always been in a high position, never before having to flee like a defeated person.

Her pride would not allow her to abandon the Xu family and run away like a failure.

“You two go. I will stay behind to face Su Nantian. Our family must leave a bloodline; you two must rebuild our family’s glory in the right place.”

“Mother, how could that be? How can I leave you behind?” Xu Hai and Xu Tian immediately widened their eyes, objecting.

“Mother, please go with us! We will only be temporarily hiding. Once this matter is resolved, we can return and reclaim our Xu family!”

Xu Hai added: “He may not necessarily uncover the truth. And that incident only our family knew about, no one else did.”

Xu Hai quickly persuaded Madam Xu again.

“Yes, Mother, when your sister gave birth to Wuchuan, you quickly resolved the issue. Now no one knows about it, and Su Nantian certainly doesn’t.”

Xu Tian also quickly supported Xu Hai’s words, urging Madam Xu to leave with them.

At this moment, Xu Hai secretly felt relieved that Madam Xu had been wise enough to keep the incident with Xu Xiangning hidden.

As long as they kept it under wraps, Su Nantian would have no chance to discover the truth and thus wouldn’t return to settle accounts with them.

But they had no idea that Su Nantian, who had just left, would return and now wore a playful expression.

“Indeed, you wouldn’t tell the truth unless I tricked you.”

In fact, Su Nantian had only feigned leaving. He had actually leapt onto a tree ahead and hidden himself.

He was not as easily deceived as the Xu family thought.

Moreover, Su Nantian had overheard their entire conversation. He had already guessed that the Xu family would not tell him the truth, and he knew if they were innocent, why would they keep discussing fleeing?

Indeed, Su Nantian listened carefully and heard their secret.

It seemed Wuchuan was their grandson, which is why they had come to seek revenge after Su Nantian killed him. Thus, all the doubts were now clear.

That was why Master Hong’s two subordinates had acted so boldly.

Chapter 881: Observing in Secret

They even thought that if they killed him, bringing the body back would give the Xu family an explanation and complete their mission.

“How did you get here?”

Xu Tian and Xu Hai both took a step back in fear, never expecting Su Nantian to have such cunning.

They thought Su Nantian had truly left and was going to ask the Nan Gong family for clarity. The Nan Gong family was in Inland Port, a distance away from M City. By the time he returned, they would have already escaped.

But they had no idea that this was all Su Nantian’s plan, and he had not truly left.

After thinking about this, Xu Hai and Xu Tian showed fearful expressions. Had Su Nantian already understood some of the truth?

The more they thought about it, the worse their expressions became. Even Madam Xu took a step back involuntarily.

Her old face was filled with fear, an emotion she had never felt before: “You….”

She stopped after saying these three words, as if she didn’t know how to continue.

Should she call Su Nantian cunning? But from his perspective, it seemed there was nothing wrong with what he had done.

But the immediate concern was not about this but how they should escape and avoid Su Nantian.

“Why? Wuchuan was not your enemy, right? I helped you deal with him. You should be grateful to me, right? How come Wuchuan is your grandson?”

Su Nantian spoke playfully and cast a meaningful glance at Xu Hai. His gaze was deep, filled with mockery, disdain, and ridicule—like mocking them for their cowardice and for calling their grandson an enemy to save their lives. It was truly absurd.

At this moment, Xu Hai and Xu Tian had no words to counter Su Nantian. Every word he spoke made them show fear, and their expressions of worry grew more intense.

“You should remember that I said if you deceived me, I would make you suffer a hundredfold.”

When Su Nantian said this, his expression suddenly turned serious. His voice had no trace of humor and even his gaze was icy.

“Don’t come closer, don’t come near me!”

Xu Hai and Xu Tian were now completely panicked. For years, they had lived in luxury and commanded subordinates without ever being threatened or having anyone defy their orders.

But now, Su Nantian was clearly different from ordinary people. He would not give them any face or stop when they spoke.

Because they all knew this answer, that was why they felt such fear upon seeing Su Nantian and realized they could not escape his pursuit.

“It’s too late; you all must die.”

Su Nantian spoke coldly, his face devoid of any emotion. Since these people had not told the truth and tried to deceive him, and they had a grudge with him before, he would not show mercy.

After saying this, Xu Hai, Xu Tian, and Madam Xu felt the air around them being sucked away. They could not breathe at all.

All three of them quickly placed their hands on their throats and opened their mouths to breathe heavily, but Su Nantian had already taken all the air from them. No matter what they did, it was futile.

The three of them were like fish out of water, thrown onto the shore by waves. No matter how they struggled, it was just futile movements before death.

Indeed, within a minute, the three of them suffocated and died, their expressions horrifying—eyes wide open, hands gripping their necks.

Uninformed people might think they had strangled themselves.

The power that had ruled M City for hundreds of years was thus eliminated by Su Nantian.

The surrounding servants dared not speak, having seen Su Nantian deal with the security personnel and the head of the Chu family. Now they dared not say anything, trembling like筛子 (sieves), and neither dared to approach nor flee.

“Don’t worry, I have no interest in your lives.”

Su Nantian let out a cold laugh. He was not a mass murderer and had no interest in slaughtering indiscriminately.

He was merely retaliating; he knew if he did not deal with them, according to the Xu family’s nature, they would eventually attack the people in the small fishing village.

Thus, Su Nantian had no choice but to act first and eliminate them to prevent them from disturbing the peace of the small fishing village again.

Now that the Xu family was gone, Su Nantian’s next target would be the Nan Gong family. He wanted to see what charm they had that made him work as their bodyguard.

Moreover, he wished to discover any connections between the Nan Gong family and himself. Perhaps by following this trail, he could find his lost memories and clarify the truth. After that, Su Nantian did not linger in this place but vanished into the night.

At this moment, Su Nantian did not know that by making this choice, he had missed meeting his subordinates who had been searching for him all along. He also drifted further from his memories.

On the other hand, Qi Yinzhen had been quietly searching for Su Nantian and had also been monitoring people related to him. Previously, he had targeted the Nan Gong family and thus discovered the Xu family’s pressure on them.

Others might not have noticed the relationship between the Xu family and Wuchuan, but Qi Yinzhen was someone who had once taken on all the team’s work to find people for Su Nantian. He was also an intelligence expert.

Thus, he quickly noticed the Xu family’s abnormalities and had started to secretly monitor them.

Qi Yinzhen had lingered around the Nan Gong family for a long time but found no significant clues.

So he changed his approach, thinking perhaps his initial direction was wrong and that Su Nantian was not nearby.

He also thought that since the Xu family were Wuchuan’s maternal relatives, it proved they had been secretly watching this matter.

Did that mean they were also searching for Su Nantian’s whereabouts?

Chapter 882: Qi Yinzhen

If he had devoted some effort to the Xu family, perhaps he could have found Su Nantian.

That was why Qi Yinzhen had decided to go to M City and investigate the Xu family. But he had no idea that when he thought of the Xu family, upon arriving here, he found the Xu family had changed overnight.

The Xu family, as M City’s top family, had been overthrown and taken over in an instant.

Moreover, his main target was already lying dead on the ground. The entire Xu family had been emptied of people, and those who survived saw Su Nantian had no other actions. Thus, they dared not stay and fled with the valuables they could carry.

No one remained in the Xu family.

When Qi Yinzhen arrived, he saw this empty Xu family and naturally could not find any clues. He couldn’t even find a person to ask about the details.

In other words, Qi Yinzhen had once again been too late and could no longer find information about Su Nantian through the Xu family.

“Damn it!”

Qi Yinzhen cursed under his breath, feeling increasingly frustrated.

He had invested so much effort to come from Inland Port but ended up missing all the information by chance. The more he thought about it, the more frustrated he felt.

And thinking of Su Nantian, who was now missing and unknown, made him furious. He really wanted to find Su Nantian quickly and confirm his arrangements.

Qi Yinzhen slowly entered the completely destroyed mansion of the Xu family, then looked at the corpses on the ground with frustration.

He had come with a last hope to see who had attacked them and whether there were other clues to find Su Nantian.

These techniques, these traces?

Qi Yinzhen first paused, his brows furrowed. He felt a bit of confusion and also something strange.

Why did he feel like he had seen these techniques before, as if they were used by someone familiar to him?

Could it be...

Qi Yinzhen widened his eyes and showed an expression of surprise. Could this truly be as he had guessed?

This fighting scene was becoming increasingly familiar, and he felt like he had seen this method before. The person who could perform such movements was definitely not an ordinary person.

He furrowed his brows, trying to recall, but he felt like he had forgotten something. He couldn’t remember it and became more confused.

He crouched down to examine the corpses of Madam Xu and others, then his eyes widened again. He suddenly realized it.

What method was this? It was one that only Su Nantian could use.

No one else could do it.

If others were to identify it, they might not recognize it, but Qi Yinzhen had worked with Su Nantian for so long and knew his fighting style.

Moreover, he was certain that no one else could perform such a level of attack.

That was why Qi Yinzhen’s face showed an expression of joy: “It’s him! It’s Su Nantian!”

It was truly Su Nantian!

Qi Yinzhen checked the other corpses and found that no one else could have done this.

After thinking about it, he jumped up and joyfully shouted.

The more he thought of Su Nantian still being alive, the happier he became. He knew that Su Nantian was lucky and had worked with him on so many tasks, doing all these good deeds.

Such achievements and merits were extraordinary. He didn’t believe that Su Nantian was a short-lived person, so Qi Yinzhen had never given up searching for him.

Fortunately, he had persisted and confirmed that Su Nantian was still alive.

After thinking about this, Qi Yinzhen was overjoyed and completely forgot that it had been a night since he arrived. He went crazy, searching the Xu family’s mansion up and down to find Su Nantian’s whereabouts.

Unfortunately, it was a negative answer. He had searched the entire Xu family but found no clues of Su Nantian. However, this was not a complete failure; at least he had confirmed that Su Nantian was still alive.

But why hadn’t Su Nantian contacted them?

Had something happened in the past few days, or had something gone wrong with Su Nantian? Qi Yinzhen’s guesses multiplied.

But he thought that once he found Su Nantian, these questions would be resolved.

Thus, the immediate priority was to find Su Nantian quickly. Only by seeing him in person could Qi Yinzhen finally relax.

But he had never given up searching for Su Nantian and was still thinking about how to follow his trail step by step, finding Su Nantian as soon as possible.

Qi Yinzhen knew that the headquarters had started to consider giving up on Su Nantian after so long without news. They also planned to find other replacements.

Thus, upon discovering Su Nantian’s traces, Qi Yinzhen immediately sent this information back to the headquarters and informed them that Su Nantian was still alive.

Only then would they continue to send help to find Su Nantian.

Indeed, after sending this message back, the people at the headquarters were overjoyed.

They had initially doubted this fact and thought Qi Yinzhen was making up an excuse to find Su Nantian. But after seeing the photos Qi Yinzhen sent back, they confirmed that this ability was only Su Nantian could perform.

And no one else had such power.

During Su Nantian’s disappearance, they had searched for other talents to replace him but found no one who could match his abilities. Not even half of his strength.

Thus, they believed there was no second Su Nantian in the world. Upon discovering that Su Nantian was still alive, the people at the headquarters changed their negative attitude and immediately dispatched more personnel to investigate Su Nantian.

They also sent many people to assist Qi Yinzhen, so he could find Su Nantian quickly.

After all, someone as talented as Su Nantian was a treasure.

Chapter 883: The Nan Gong Family

The headquarters would not allow any more mistakes and could not let Su Nantian fall into others’ hands.

With more manpower and resources, Qi Yinzhen felt even happier.

He believed that by following this clue, he could quickly find Su Nantian.

After thinking about it, Qi Yinzhen smiled brightly. He couldn’t help but think in his heart: “Big Brother, you are waiting for me; I will find you soon.”

Qi Yinzhen vowed to find Su Nantian quickly and would not let him wander alone outside.

Fortunately, now with so many people sent by the headquarters to help, it would be twice as effective and he could find Su Nantian quickly.

Qi Yinzhen held this thought, even though he had missed the best opportunity to find Su Nantian. He did not continue to feel sad but instead thought of continuing his efforts and would surely find Su Nantian soon.

Big Brother, wait for me! I will definitely find you soon!

Qi Yinzhen clenched his fists, thinking of Su Nantian.

At this moment, Su Nantian had no idea that besides the villagers of the small fishing village who missed him, there was also a good brother searching for him outside.

And Su Nantian did not know that he had missed the best opportunity to approach the truth of his memories.

If he had stayed a little longer, he might have met Qi Yinzhen.

Now Su Nantian had prepared to return to the Nan Gong family based on the information he had obtained from the Xu family, to see why he had worked as their bodyguard. Thus, he hadn’t thought of other issues and didn’t realize that there was also truth waiting for him here.

At this moment, the Nan Gong family had already lost their former glory under Qi Yinzhen’s pressure.

Originally, they were a family that had opposed Wuchuan in Inland Port. Before Wuchuan’s death, they had divided the power evenly.

But after Wuchuan died, they were instead deprived of their authority and had no more drive than before.

What was even more confusing for the Nan Gong family was that they did not know who was behind this, nor why so many people targeted them instead of others. They had also lost many opportunities.

Now, some small families in Inland Port had rapidly grown under the support of this mysterious person. Their development was now undeniable.

These people were not foolish; they seized every opportunity to absorb nutrients and climbed upward relentlessly.

Now, although they had not yet grown into a family as large as the Nan Gong family, several families together had become formidable and were no longer able to be dominated by the Nan Gong family as before.

“Father!”

Nan Gong Yuyan rushed into her father Nan Gong Lin’s room. Seeing his frail body, she felt even more distressed and cursed the person who had targeted them a thousand times but still wasn’t satisfied.

After their brother and sister had quarreled, Nan Gong Lin’s health had drastically declined and it was no longer possible to hide this from them.

At that time, Nan Gong Yuyan and Nan Gong Ping finally understood that their father had been enduring pain for a long time. To avoid worrying them and to prevent outsiders from seeing their family’s weakness, he had always endured silently without revealing his suffering.

Just thinking about how Nan Gong Lin had secretly carried so much and endured so much pain, Nan Gong Yuyan and Nan Gong Ping felt even more guilt.

They had previously fought for their father’s favor, dividing resources among themselves.

But now, seeing their father in such a critical condition, they had finally calmed down and stopped fighting.

They did not want their father to die with regrets, and they both knew that the reason for their family’s recent problems was because of this.
