Therefore, if Wu Chuan wished to ensure his puppet's stability, he must choose Wu You'er. Moreover, Wu You'er's lineage was impeccable; she was Wu Tao's only daughter and a member of the Wu Clan's main branch. Additionally, as a girl who had remained disconnected from the Wu Clan for years, she knew nothing of its inner workings.

Wu Tao had at least fled the Wu Clan after reaching adulthood, so he retained many memories of it. Many within the Wu Clan still revered him as a legitimate main branch disciple, and if he had been chosen to inherit, Wu Chuan would have lost his current position entirely, forced to relinquish all power.

Furthermore, if Wu Tao had truly been chosen as the heir, there would have been no need to convene this gathering or invite the major clans. Wu Tao could have directly inherited as the sole male heir of the main branch.

Thus, Wu Chuan had to elevate Wu You'er to maintain control—placing her as the public puppet while he remained the unseen master.

Su Nantian stared intently at the spot where everyone had passed, determined to be the first to notice Wu You'er's arrival.

At that moment, Wu Chuan declared on stage: "Alright, now let us welcome the final candidate for the Wu Clan's heir. This candidate is the only female among the four, and she possesses many unique qualities. I shall explain further after she ascends."

Clearly, Wu Chuan's demeanor had shifted dramatically from before. When introducing the other candidates, he had merely offered a few brief words, but now his speech was far more elaborate as he introduced the last candidate. His intent was unmistakable—he supported this person.

This was not a mistake on Wu Chuan's part; it was deliberate. He wished to make his stance clear to the attending clans, revealing who he endorsed. His goal was to ensure these clans did not oppose him openly. If they could cooperate, it would be ideal.

Chapter 475: Interest Above All

At last, Wu Chuan waved his hand, signaling the final heir candidate to ascend.

Su Nantian's eyes remained fixed on the door. When the final figure appeared, he clenched his fists—yet it was none other than Wu You'er.

After so many days apart, Wu You'er appeared thinner but still possessed a glint in her eyes. Her overall demeanor was excellent, suggesting she had not suffered under the Wu Clan's control. She must have been able to meet with Wu Tao and his wife, so her current state was relatively stable.

After ascending the stage, Wu You'er glanced at Wu Chuan, who nodded and whispered something to her.

The other clan leaders seated below could not hear Wu Chuan's words, but Su Nantian could. Wu Chuan told her: "Recite what I taught you. Remember, go."

Wu You'er then stepped forward, scanning the crowd. At that moment, her gaze met Su Nantian's for a fleeting second. Su Nantian nearly lunged forward to snatch her away, but he knew he could not act rashly. He needed to rescue Wu You'er and Wu Tao's family, but he could not do so alone. Even if he managed to free them, they would likely face continued interference from the Wu Clan afterward.

Thus, Su Nantian's wisest course of action was to observe and seize this opportunity to alter the Wu Clan's power dynamics.

Moreover, even if Wu You'er had exchanged glances with Su Nantian, she could not recognize him. Su Nantian was now disguised; to her, this face was entirely unfamiliar.

Indeed, even if he approached Wu You'er now, she would likely dismiss him as a stranger.

At that moment, Wu You'er stood on stage and said: "Hello, I am Wu You'er. I am a member of the Wu Clan's main branch. My grandfather was the previous head of the Wu Clan. According to my status, I could have directly inherited the clan. However, due to internal turmoil within the Wu Clan, my return was not well-received. Thus, I now ask for your assistance in upholding justice for the Wu Clan. I believe you all have your own intentions, so I hope you will consider this carefully."

Upon hearing Wu You'er's words, Su Nantian raised an eyebrow. Clearly, this was not her natural speaking style. Combined with Wu Chuan's earlier remarks, it was evident he had scripted these lines for her to recite.

At that moment, Wu Chuan stepped forward with a smile and said: "Indeed, as you heard, Wu You'er is my father's granddaughter—my niece. However, the Wu Clan has been in turmoil for a long time. My grandfather's departure left everything in chaos, and I have been the one maintaining order. Regrettably, as an adopted child, my words hold little weight. Thus, I retrieved the main branch's heir who had left years ago and sought to support him diligently. Yet, due to the clan's instability, it was difficult to gain consensus. Hence, we have gathered here today."

Wu Chuan's words painted him as a victim of injustice, placing himself in the role of the oppressed. The other Wu Clan candidates appeared furious but dared not speak out, knowing Wu Chuan held real power. To oppose him now would be futile.

They might instead seek a chance to turn the tide, and if they could secure enough votes from the other clans, they might challenge Wu Chuan's authority. Even if Wu Chuan controlled real power, they could gradually pressure him to relinquish it.

Though the Wu Clan seemed in disarray, once a legitimate head emerged, others would heed his commands. This was why Wu Chuan, despite holding power, feared anyone else claiming the headship.

"Alright, these are all our heir candidates. They have met everyone here. After breakfast, we will begin the selection process. Each candidate will occupy a private room to present their vision for the Wu Clan's future. Feel free to tour and consider who you believe possesses the ability to lead."

Su Nantian found Wu Chuan's words puzzling. As he was not part of the major clans, he was unfamiliar with such procedures. He knew only that each clan held one vote. Besides the Wu Clan itself, Nan Gong, Wang, Huang, and Song each had a vote. They could cast their votes for whomever they supported. However, he could not fathom what the "tour" entailed.

Just then, Nan Gong Ping whispered: "This is just a formality. Who cares if the Wu Clan's heir has talent? Honestly, we'd be happier if they lacked it. After all, it's about利益 (interests). This is pointless."

Nan Gong Yayan nodded: "Still, the formality must be observed. Everyone knows it's a farce; we're watching who offers better conditions. But this cannot be done openly, so a veil is needed. Anyway, we'll just tour around now. The real negotiations will begin tonight. I suspect those who haven't approached us yet will come."

Nan Gong Ping and Nan Gong Yayan clearly had no qualms about this. It seemed unimportant, so Su Nantian ceased overthinking it. His priority was to connect with Wu You'er first, for only together could they rescue her and Wu Tao's family.

Chapter 476: Wu Yu

After introducing the heir candidates, they began their meal, followed by what was termed a "presentation."

Su Nantian and Wang Meng soon learned what this entailed. Each heir candidate occupied a private room, presenting their vision for the Wu Clan's future and analyzing its current state. Anyone could visit these rooms, so the major clans freely observed what interested them.

Naturally, they did not delve into confidential matters; it was merely a display of talent. While the intention was to attract attention, it was ultimately just a formality.

As Nan Gong Ping and Nan Gong Yayan had discussed earlier, their choice was not based on talent but on the conditions offered. They preferred a candidate with no talent but generous offers.

Su Nantian and Wang Meng wandered through the rooms, observing Wu You'er's presentation. She stood before a screen, analyzing the Wu Clan's current state—though her academic background had no relation to this. It was clear these lines were scripted by Wu Chuan.

Though Su Nantian longed to approach her immediately, he knew it was inappropriate now. He would find an opportunity later that night.

As Nan Gong Yayan had mentioned yesterday, Wu Chuan was the one approaching them, indicating that Wu You'er was not involved in these private negotiations. After all, Wu You'er knew little of such underhanded dealings. These "private" talks required Wu Chuan's direct involvement. This was also a clear signal to the clans that Wu Chuan favored Wu You'er.

Thus, Su Nantian planned to seize this opportunity to find Wu You'er, reveal his identity, and determine how to rescue her and Wu Tao's family.

The day passed, and the night brought activity. Nan Gong Ping remained composed in his room, doing as he pleased while waiting for the other candidates to arrive. The Nan Gong Clan was a focal point of contention, as securing their endorsement meant gaining two votes—since the Huang Clan would undoubtedly follow.

Thus, these candidates would certainly seek out Nan Gong Ping. Wu Feng and Wu Yu would also approach the Nan Gong Clan, as Wu Chuan's stance was now clear. To challenge Wu Chuan, they needed the support of the major clans.

Indeed, soon after, someone knocked on Nan Gong Ping's door. Wang Meng peered through the peephole, nodded to Nan Gong Ping and Su Nantian, then raised one finger.

They had agreed: if the visitor was Wu Yu, he would raise one finger; if it was Wu Feng, two. Clearly, the visitor was Wu Yu.

Nan Gong Ping nodded and signaled Wang Meng to open the door.

"Good evening, Nan Gong Young Master. I am Wu Yu. I hope you noticed me today, though I know I have caught your attention many times." Wu Yu greeted Nan Gong Ping with flattery, but Nan Gong Ping had no interest in him unless he offered something compelling.

Nan Gong Ping was not blind; he knew that until the heir was decided, anyone could become the Wu Clan's future head. Thus, he would not offend any of them before then.

Though Nan Gong Ping had not noticed Wu Yu earlier, he smiled and said: "Of course. Your performance was outstanding; I naturally noticed you. Among the four candidates, your eloquence and demeanor were most remarkable. I watched your presentation on the Wu Clan's future and found it truly impressive."

These were polite words, as Nan Gong Ping had no idea what Wu Yu had said. But to maintain face, he had to say this.

Moreover, Nan Gong Ping knew these words would never be exposed, as Wu Yu would not press the issue. After all, he was here to negotiate, not to be praised.

Indeed, Wu Yu quickly changed the subject: "Nan Gong Young Master, you know our Nan Gong Clan's vote is precious. How many people have approached you today?"

Wu Yu asked cautiously, though he knew Nan Gong Ping might not answer.

Nan Gong Ping smiled and said: "Ah, this is a difficult question to answer. However, I can tell you that today, you are the first. It doesn't matter how many have come before; now that you're here, we can discuss it. If your offer is good enough, I won't mind who came before you. You know our Nan Gong Clan's vote is worth two votes. I believe you should consider your offer carefully before presenting it; if it's insufficient, I won't entertain it."

Nan Gong Ping spoke deliberately to make Wu Yu think longer. Naturally, the more利益 (interests) one gains, the better.

Wu Yu smiled and looked at Su Nantian and Wang Meng standing nearby before turning back to Nan Gong Ping: "Nan Gong Young Master, this..."

Wu Yu's intent was clear—he wished Nan Gong Ping to send Su Nantian and Wang Meng away. But Nan Gong Ping waved his hand: "Don't worry; these two are my trusted men. You may speak freely here. They will listen but not speak. So, tell me what benefits you can offer."

Wu Yu, seeing Nan Gong Ping's stance, could not argue further and immediately said: "Of course. Though our Wu Clan branch is but a minor one, we can still offer many benefits to the Nan Gong Clan. I heard you wished to expand into hotel business; we can support this, even giving you a hotel outright."

Chapter 477: A Clear Contrast in Power

Upon hearing Wu Yu's words, Nan Gong Ping laughed. Offering hotel support and giving a hotel outright—this was absurd. The benefits he had received were incomparable, even Wu Ruotian's vague promises of the Wu Clan's future paled in comparison.

Nan Gong Ping slapped Wu Yu on the shoulder and said: "Wu Yu, your ideas are indeed beautiful. But do you think this small amount of benefit would suffice to dismiss us? How much is a hotel worth—tens of millions, hundreds of millions?"

Nan Gong Ping recalled Nan Gong Yayan's words from yesterday about Wu Chuan's offer—third of the port profits, which would grant their clan over ten billion annually. Compared to this, Wu Yu's offer was trivial.

Standing nearby, Su Nantian had not expected Wu Yu—so ambitious and commanding on stage—to be so timid. Yet, how could he offer such a weak deal? There must be another plan; otherwise, this proposal lacked appeal.

Indeed, Wu Yu smiled and said: "Nan Gong Young Master, don't be hasty. This is what our Wu Clan branch can offer. However, if I become the heir, there will be more from the Wu Clan itself. The Wu Clan's main profit source is the inland port. If you support me, I can offer half of the port's profits for a year."

Wu Yu was indeed clever, matching Wu Chuan's offer but doubling it. Wu Chuan had promised a third of the profits, while Wu Yu offered half. If realized, this would bring greater gains for the Nan Gong Clan.

Yet Nan Gong Ping did not appear surprised or delighted. He knew he must remain calm and avoid revealing his stance.

He also recognized this offer as the most generous he had received so far, excluding Wu Ruotian's unrealistic promises.

"Are you only seeking our Nan Gong Clan's vote? There are two other major clans. If you cannot secure their votes and face the Wu Clan's internal decisions, I believe it will be difficult for you to turn things around. If you offer half of the profits, do you plan to seek the other half from others? That would mean the Wu Clan's entire port profits for a year would be wasted."

Nan Gong Ping concluded that this offer was too hasty and said so.

"Your vote is equivalent to the Huang Clan's. Your decision's value lies not in your current strength within the Wu Clan, but in your ability to influence the Huang Clan. I will also seek other clans. I have already prepared to forgo a year's income, and one year is nothing. But if I don't fight for it, it will have no relation to me. What I can offer is already the limit—everything I can give to the Nan Gong Clan, both from my future and our branch's resources, is here."

Wu Yu said this with a relieved expression, as if his candidacy for the Wu Clan's heir was already secured. If it failed, he seemed indifferent.

Su Nantian was moved by Wu Yu's words. He knew Wu Yu was playing on emotional appeal, trying to stir sympathy. But it was difficult, as these clan representatives were shrewd and focused solely on their families' interests.

Yet Wu Yu's words demonstrated sincerity, offering everything he had. This was also a tactic.

After hearing Wu Yu's words, Nan Gong Ping nodded and said: "I will consider it. Honestly, your offer is tempting, but I cannot accept it yet." Nan Gong Ping's implication was clear—he had given the guest a dismissal. These people were direct in such matters; once negotiations were over, there was no need to linger.

Wu Yu immediately stood up and smiled: "I look forward to a positive response. I hope you will consider it carefully. Thank you very much."

Wu Yu then left the room with Wang Meng's guidance.

"This Wu Yu's offer is currently the best, but we must continue observing. Let's see what Wu Feng can offer." Nan Gong Ping, seeing Wu Yu leave, rubbed his chin thoughtfully and said to Su Nantian.

Su Nantian did not interject, though he had his own thoughts on these matters. However, he remembered his current role as a bodyguard, not part of the Nan Gong Clan's advisory team. He knew his main task was to rescue Wu You'er and Wu Tao's family, making these matters irrelevant. Who became the Wu Clan's head was unimportant to him.

Unless it was Wu You'er and Wu Tao, but this scenario was impossible.

However, shortly after, the door knocked again—no need to guess; it had to be Wu Feng.

Wu Feng also brought his offer to the Nan Gong Clan, but his proposal was inferior to Wu Yu's. Wu Yu's offer was arguably the best after Wu Ruotian's empty promises, even surpassing Wu Chuan. Wu Feng's offer was stingy, clearly attempting to win over all major clans but fearing that if he became head, the Wu Clan would have no income. Thus, he only promised one-fifth of the port's profits.

This offer was insufficient for Nan Gong Ping, who preferred a more secure option like Wu Chuan's third of the profits. Moreover, it seemed the Wu Clan's internal opinion leaned toward Wu Chuan. Thus, choosing Wu Chuan was safer.

After all, no matter how generous the offers were, if he did not become the heir, it was all for nothing.

Chapter 478: Eavesdropping

At this point, Su Nantian could clearly see the Nan Gong Clan's intentions. Based on current circumstances, Wu Yu and Wu Chuan's offers were the best, but compared to these, Nan Gong Ping seemed more inclined toward Wu Chuan.

This was because Wu Chuan had a greater chance of securing his chosen candidate as the heir, and only after becoming head would the benefits promised to the major clans be fulfilled.

Thus, Nan Gong Ping and Nan Gong Yayan had agreed to vote for Wu You'er, which meant the Huang Clan would also support her.

As for other clans, they were not fools; they understood the principle of利益 (interests). Thus, they would likely make similar calculations. Except for Wang Clan's young master, who was a variable, it seemed other clans would also choose Wu Chuan.

It wasn't just because Wu Chuan's offer was better; it was also because, in the major clans' eyes, if Wu Chuan took over the Wu Clan, internal conflicts would still be inevitable.

Firstly, Wu Chuan was essentially a usurper, so his position was precarious. Naturally, other Wu Clan members would resent this, leading to internal strife. This would weaken the Wu Clan's strength among the major clans, which was beneficial for them.

As previously mentioned, the more chaos there is, the happier other clans would be. This was the logic.

"Tomorrow is still a day; there's no need to rush. But we are likely to choose Wu Chuan, which should be fine. I think this is a consensus," Nan Gong Ping and his sister Nan Gong Yayan discussed the day's events, exchanging their views.

Nan Gong Yayan nodded in agreement: "You're right. I also think we should choose Wu Chuan for safety. Though his offer is not as good as Wu Yu's, he currently holds power within the Wu Clan. Thus, his position in the internal selection is already secure. We just need to consolidate our votes with other major clans. If we Nan Gong Clan vote, the Huang Clan will follow. Then, the Wu Clan's head must be Wu Chuan's chosen candidate—Wu You'er. Thus, our chances of winning are greater."

Nan Gong Yayan's thoughts aligned with Nan Gong Ping's. Both were considering how the Nan Gong Clan could safely secure their interests, and after this calculation, choosing Wu Chuan was the safest option.

"However, there's still one day left; let's see what these people have in store. Perhaps there will be a surprise. These people, knowing they face Wu Chuan, must have some tricks up their sleeves; otherwise, coming here would be like walking into a tiger's den. Moreover, Wu Chuan is currently the de facto ruler of the Wu Clan. If these people do not secure the headship, Wu Chuan will surely retaliate. With Wu Chuan's petty nature, retaliation is inevitable."

Nan Gong Yayan suddenly recalled something and spoke continuously.

After Nan Gong Ping and Nan Gong Yayan discussed for a while, they each returned to their rooms. Su Nantian also went back to his room. That night, Wang Meng remained in Nan Gong Ping's room to protect him, so Su Nantian had private time.

However, Su Nantian had already unintentionally seen the Wu Clan's layout map from Nan Gong Yayan's assistant. It included Wu You'er's current room. Thus, that night Su Nantian planned to investigate.

Since the major clans all had bodyguards, the Wu Clan did not station guards in the guest rooms but only patrolled at set times. Thus, Su Nantian waited for the security patrol to leave and then quietly stepped out of his room.

He headed toward the location he had seen Wu You'er's room.

This journey was smooth, as security had just finished patrolling and it was midnight—no one met him along the way.

When Su Nantian stood at Wu You'er's door, he carefully pressed his ear against it to listen. At that moment, Su Nantian realized the room was not occupied by Wu You'er alone; there was also a middle-aged man's voice.

This man seemed to be giving orders.

Thus, Su Nantian activated his heightened senses, amplifying his hearing to clearly discern what was being said inside.

"Tomorrow is the final day; don't cause any trouble. The next day, these major clans will vote. If I can stabilize things tomorrow, you must cooperate well; otherwise, you know the consequences." This was clearly Wu Chuan's voice, and he seemed to be threatening Wu You'er.

"I know; I won't ruin your plans. But you must promise to ensure my parents' safety. And once the head is chosen, let us leave immediately!" Wu You'er's voice sounded normal, so she seemed unharmed. However, Su Nantian could hear Wu Chuan was using her parents as leverage to threaten her.

"This was discussed long ago. After the head is chosen, you cannot leave immediately. You must stay in the Wu Clan for two years. After those two years, you can go anywhere you wish. Moreover, I will give you a large sum of money, very substantial, and then your family will have no connection to the Wu Clan."

"Why can't we leave immediately? I've said before, our family has no interest in the Wu Clan's heir or head. We won't interfere with yours. I can immediately transfer this Wu Clan headship to you. There's no need for us to stay in the Wu Clan for two years. If we wanted to remain, my father wouldn't have fled the Wu Clan back then." Wu You'er spoke firmly.

Chapter 479: Reunion

Su Nantian could tell Wu You'er was currently safe, but Wu Tao and his wife were still in Wu Chuan's hands. Wu You'er could not meet them, only comply with Wu Chuan's arrangements to vie for the headship. Only after becoming heir would Wu Chuan allow them to leave.

Moreover, Wu Chuan's intent was clear—he wished to claim the Wu Clan for himself but feared his status as an adopted child made him illegitimate. Thus, he wanted Wu You'er to control the clan for two years before handing over the headship to him instead of immediately transferring it.

If Wu You'er transferred the headship directly, people would see her as a mere substitute for Wu Chuan's bid. Though everyone understood this in their hearts, surface gestures could not be ignored. If they were ignored, anyone could demand Wu Chuan relinquish his power.

This was why Wu Chuan wanted Wu You'er to stay for two years before leaving.

"Anyway, just keep it up for these two days. I will fulfill what I promised you. But if you don't obey, I can't guarantee what will happen to Wu Tao! Got it? Hmph!"

After Wu Chuan spoke, Su Nantian heard footsteps approaching the door. He knew Wu Chuan was leaving and quickly scanned his surroundings, but there were no hiding spots.

Finally, Su Nantian looked up and noticed a vent above him. He immediately performed a swan dive, opening the vent and crawling inside.

After Su Nantian secured the vent's exit, he saw Wu Chuan exiting Wu You'er's room and leaving with a cold哼.

Once Su Nantian confirmed Wu Chuan had left, he jumped down from the vent and approached Wu You'er's door again.

Su Nantian had not expected Wu Chuan to forget to close the door in his anger. The door was slightly ajar, an opportunity too perfect to ignore. Thus, Su Nantian immediately pushed the door open and shut it behind him.

The room's Wu You'er heard the door closing and was suspicious. Wu Chuan had just left, so why was there a sound at the door? She approached the door and saw an unfamiliar man closing it. She was startled and grabbed a broom, clutching it tightly before shouting: "Who are you? Why are you in my room? Leave immediately! If you don't, I'll call for help!"

After saying this, Wu You'er suddenly realized something and took two steps back. She then opened a box on the wall, which contained a red button. If she was not mistaken, this was an alarm button.

"Don't press it! Don't press it! It's me! It's me!" Su Nantian quickly raised his hands. If Wu You'er pressed it, he would find it difficult to return later.

In fact, Wu You'er had no intention of pressing it; she just wanted to scare this person away. If she did press it, Wu Chuan would likely send more guards here. She had already argued to avoid having bodyguards nearby, preserving at least a little personal freedom.

Hearing this man's words, Wu You'er was curious. She had never met him before, yet he spoke as if they were familiar. Thus, she hesitated and said: "Who are you? I've never seen you before. Don't try to flatter me; if you leave now, I'll pretend I never saw you. But if you have ulterior motives, I'll press it immediately. Also, let me tell you the Wu Clan is rich, but I'm not. There's nothing valuable here; if you want something valuable, go elsewhere."

Su Nantian nearly laughed at Wu You'er's words. He had been mistaken for a thief, and she was earnestly telling him she had no money.

"Pfft."

Su Nantian finally couldn't help laughing, which further confused Wu You'er. What was this person doing? She had spoken seriously, but this thief was mocking her.

"Why are you laughing? What did you come for? If you don't say, I'll press it!" Wu You'er said this while pretending to press the button.

"Don't! Don't! I'll tell you now!" Su Nantian said again.

"Then speak quickly!" Wu You'er frowned impatiently.

"How could you not recognize my voice? That's really heartbreaking." Su Nantian shook his head.

Wu You'er felt something was off. Actually, when she heard this man's voice earlier, she had a second of thinking it was Su Nantian. But after seeing his face, she dismissed the thought. Moreover, this man didn't look like he was disguised, so Wu You'er discarded the idea immediately.

Su Nantian saw Wu You'er's confusion and pointed at his face, saying: "It's me, Su Nantian. How could you not recognize me after I've disguised myself?"

Wu You'er hadn't expected this person to actually say Su Nantian's name. Moreover, she knew that besides herself and her parents, no one else should know who Su Nantian was. Thus, she became very excited and asked: "Is it true? Are you Su Nantian? I don't believe it! Your disguise is so perfect, there's no trace. Prove it to me; take off your disguise and let me see!"

Wu You'er was happy but cautious. She knew she was alone here and must be careful with everything. Even if someone said they were Su Nantian, she had to verify it. After all, this man was disguised; who knew who was underneath that face?

Su Nantian could only sigh helplessly. He couldn't remove his disguise now; it had never been taken off since he entered that farmhouse. His disguise was highly advanced, and if he removed it now to prove his identity, it would take a long time to reapply.

But he had already been out for some time, and if he didn't want to expose himself, he needed to finish this conversation and return.

Chapter 480: Current Situation

Wu You'er kept asking Su Nantian to remove his disguise, but he could not do so. He had no time or energy to maintain this disguise. If he removed it now, it would take a long time to reapply.
