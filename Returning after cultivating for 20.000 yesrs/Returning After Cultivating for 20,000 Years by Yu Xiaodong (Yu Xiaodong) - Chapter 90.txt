"Director Zhang, do you finally agree to our terms?" The pharmacist, hearing no response after a long silence, asked again.

"Ah, this matter...," Zhang Feng did not immediately refuse but hesitated, as if there was something unspoken.

"What conditions do you wish to propose? We will certainly agree if we can fulfill them," the pharmacist continued, making grand promises.

"Regarding this matter, let's discuss it later. You should first get to know us through the business department. After all, with Chuang Rong's strength, even without me, they could have secured this business."

Zhang Feng's words were clearly a dismissal; he had no intention of continuing the discussion.

"Fine, Director Zhang. I won't disturb you further. It's already late; rest well. But remember, my words are always valid," the pharmacist said before hanging up. He knew this was just an initial contact and test, so he could not be too aggressive.

After hanging up, Qi Yeyu said immediately: "Zhang Feng must have had his mind set. When I called earlier, his tone was completely different. But since I didn't mention specific conditions, it's understandable he refused. Clearly, your terms appealed to him."

"Take it slow; this is just the first contact. He definitely won't budge immediately. Moreover, everyone in Tihao Group is now on edge and afraid to act," the pharmacist nodded.

"Master said we should proceed gradually, not press too hard. However, I believe if the conditions are right, Zhang Feng will definitely bite. At least today's situation was optimistic; he didn't refuse outright but hesitated," Qi Yeyu said, then stood up. "I'll go report to the master about tonight's situation."

The pharmacist nodded, and Qi Yeyu returned to his room to contact Su Nantian. The next steps needed guidance from Su Nantian.

He knew his own mind was no match for Qi Yinzhen, and he still needed Su Nantian's guidance in these matters.

Chapter 438: Inheritance

Meanwhile, the matter regarding Zhang Feng was proceeding smoothly. Meanwhile, news arrived from Kyoto.

Because Song Lichen was busy, he did not personally call Su Nantian but sent one of his trusted subordinates, a loyal and reliable man, to contact Su Nantian.

This matter involved the internal affairs of several major families in Kyoto, so some information was confidential. However, Song Lichen did not keep it secret but personally sent his subordinate to Hangcheng to deliver the documents directly to Su Nantian.

Of course, this was because the information contained no sensitive details for him. Although it involved internal disputes among major families, Song Lichen believed it was not a secret matter and that exchanging this information for Su Nantian's favor was worth it.

Su Nantian received Song Lichen's subordinate at his villa. The man, named Song Yang, had been an orphan since childhood and was adopted by Song Lichen. Thus, he was extremely loyal to Song Lichen; whatever Song Lichen asked him to do, he would complete it. Moreover, Song Lichen had specifically told Su Nantian that he was an important partner, so when Song Yang met Su Nantian, he showed great respect.

"Mr. Su, here are the documents from Mr. Song. There's also some content I need to verbally convey to you. This involves internal disputes among the Kyoto families, but it's not classified informationâ€”just things that most people don't investigate and thus remain unknown. All these matters are in the documents, but what I need to tell you is about Wu's current situation."

Song Yang was extremely professional and spoke clearly, with a logical flow. After speaking, Su Nantian immediately understood what this visit was about.

"Speak," Su Nantian said. "What's the current situation with Wu? Why did they suddenly bring back someone who hadn't returned to Wu for years? And it's not just Wu Tao and his wife; they also took their child."

Su Nantian had many questions, but only someone like Song Lichen from a major family could obtain the true internal information of Wu. Even Su Nantian himself would have found it difficult to learn this without Song Lichen's help.

"Please note, what I'm about to say is confidential. Please don't spread it after hearing it; this is Mr. Song's only request," Song Yang said carefully before looking at Su Nantian, hoping he would agree.

Su Nantian nodded immediately and said, "You can rest assured. Since I asked Mr. Song to investigate this information, naturally I won't spread it. If it causes any trouble for Mr. Song, I would be willing to die a thousand deaths."

Su Nantian spoke seriously, and after hearing this, Song Yang felt relieved.

"Several days ago, Wu's eldest son was murdered while abroad, and the method was extremely brutal. The investigation is still ongoing, but Wu's family has already stirred up some unrest. As the heir, he was gone, and then they started fighting for the inheritance position. Wu Tao and his wife have the right to inherit, so they were taken back for this reason," Song Yang summarized briefly. Su Nantian immediately understood the situation, but he still had questions.

"Why did they also take Wu Tao's child? Isn't it enough for Wu Tao to return, and then they could fight for the inheritance?" Su Nantian still didn't understand why they later sent people to find Wu You'er.

"That involves the affairs of several major families. Wu's family is currently in turmoil, so some external forces want to stir up the situation. This matter is too complex; it's all in the documents. You can read them later. What I can say is that Wu Tao and his family were taken back by Wu's people, not by external families. This at least ensures their safety within Wu's family, but whether other families will attack them is uncertain."

Song Yang said this with a furrowed brow, as the topic had turned to a concerning direction.

"May I ask one more question?" Su Nantian asked cautiously, as Song Yang was from Song Lichen's group. Naturally, he had to show some courtesy.

"Mr. Su, please ask. If I can answer, I will; if not, I truly cannot. Please forgive me," Song Yang nodded and indicated that Su Nantian could ask.

"What I want to ask is whether your family, Song Lichen, has participated in this matter. This depends on how I act when I go to rescue Wu You'er," Su Nantian said without hesitation. Since they had reached this point, there was no need to play games with Song Lichen's people.

"This..." Song Yang looked troubled. Though he didn't speak, Su Nantian could guess that Song's family was involved. If they weren't involved, Song Yang would have said so directly. Now his hesitation suggested he was considering whether to say or not.

After half a minute, Song Yang lifted his head as if he had made up his mind. "Of course, someone from the Song family is involved, but this matter has nothing to do with Mr. Song. If you want to rescue Wu Tao and his family, please show some courtesy to the Song family. If it's impossible to be courteous, we can't say anything. However, you can rest assured that this matter has no direct impact on Mr. Song. But if you offend the Song family, both sides may not be able to maintain their current relationship."

"Understood. Thank you for your honesty. This matter is very important to me. Please thank Mr. Song on my behalf. I remember what you said; this time, I owe Mr. Song a great favor. Plus, the previous matter where we acted as intermediaries means I've already owed two favors. In the future, when there's an opportunity, I Su Nantian will go through fire and water to repay the favor. I won't forget this."

Indeed, Song Yang had already revealed everything about the Song family, which was a complete act of kindness for Su Nantian. It showed that Song Lichen truly respected Su Nantian.

"Alright, Mr. Su, my mission is complete. Please destroy these documents after reading them. I'll leave now," Song Yang said before leaving without looking back, as he needed to return to Song Lichen and report the matter.

Chapter 439: Wu Family's Turmoil

After receiving intelligence about the Wu family from Song Yang, Su Nantian fell into deep thought. He had never expected that the affairs among Kyoto's major families were so unpredictable.

At first, when Wu's family came to Hangcheng and took back Wu Tao and his wife, Su Nantian had not anticipated it was because of the inheritance selection. He thought there must be another reason.

But now, things had become slightly complicated. If it was about selecting the Wu family's heir, then it was a matter of Wu's internal affairs. Thus, Su Nantian would find it difficult to interfere.

Moreover, this indicated that those who took back Wu Tao and his family had no absolute priority in the inheritance struggle. Thus, they had to find Wu Tao's family who had left Wu's main house to obtain the ticket for competing in the inheritance.

More importantly, Wu Tao and his wife, along with Wu You'er, were far from the Wu family. They hadn't returned for years and had no connections within the Wu family, so they would be at others' mercy, completely at their disposal.

Thinking of this, Su Nantian's brows furrowed involuntarily. If he truly didn't intervene in this matter, Wu Tao and his wife would become others' puppets.

However, the Wu family's current situation was an internal dispute. As an outsider, how could he get involved in another family's inheritance struggle? But since Song Lichen had managed to obtain this information and subtly told Su Nantian that other major families were also watching this matter, it indicated they were all eyeing the position.

After all, Wu's current heir was vacant, and it was a time of chaos. If they could install their people or support their forces to gain the Wu family's inheritance position, it would be a great advantage for other major families.

Su Nantian thought about this and realized that if he went to Kyoto, he would have to ally with these major families to access the Wu family's internal inheritance struggle. Although his relationship with Wu Lianxing was clear, he wouldn't participate in the inheritance competition. Thus, this path was blocked for Su Nantian.

But fortunately, Song Lichen had done a good deed by sending Song Yang to convey the message. This was essentially to personally protect this information about Kyoto's major families' conflicts and deliver the document safely into Su Nantian's hands.

Although this information could be transmitted online, it would leave a trace. Anything transmitted over the network could be traced back to its source. Thus, if they had sent this information through the network to Su Nantian, it would have been discovered. It was better for Song Yang to carry this information personally, which was the safest way. Who could have imagined that Song Yang came to see Su Nantian just to deliver this information?

Su Nantian opened the document Song Yang had brought and glanced at it briefly before putting it back. Now was not the time to deploy this plan. For Su Nantian, the most important thing now was to expose Zhang Feng's flaws.

To deal with external threats first, it was most important to ensure the safety of his rear. Thus, he must resolve the issue with Tihao Group first before he could feel at ease to go to Kyoto and deal with Wu Tao's family and Wu You'er.

Su Nantian was waiting, waiting for the moment when Zhang Feng would bite.

Indeed, Su Nantian's current plan was the simplest but also the easiest to catch. Although there had been a precedent with Li Hounian, deception was still effective. Moreover, people always had a sense ofä¾¥å¹¸ (luck), so when they encountered such situations, their inner impulses were even stronger.

Moreover, the conditions proposed by Yao Lao and Qi Yeyu were very tempting. Zhang Feng had no reason not to bite, so Su Nantian was already confident that Zhang Feng would eventually take the bait.

However, good news came quickly. Although they had waited for several days, Zhang Feng seemed to have no movement at all. But that day, Qi Yeyu finally received a call from Zhang Feng.

Seeing the caller ID on his phone, Qi Yeyu was immediately startled. Why would Zhang Feng call him? It must be about the matter he had previously discussed.

But one thing Qi Yeyu was a bit puzzled about was that both Yao Lao and himself had expressed their desire for cooperation to Zhang Feng. However, unlike Yao Lao's specific conditions, Qi Yeyu had not given any concrete promises. He had only indicated that he would definitely give Zhang Feng benefits.

This was actually what Su Nantian had specifically instructed Qi Yeyu and Yao Lao to do from the beginning. This way, Zhang Feng would find them earlier.

Indeed, this call was proof of that. And at the time, Su Nantian had also mentioned some subsequent matters; now was the time to verify them.

Qi Yeyu cleared his throat and answered the call.

"Hello, Director Zhang? I don't know if there's anything you want to instruct me about. Is it because you've thought over the matter I told you?" Qi Yeyu continued with his initial approach, directly addressing the issue of cooperation without circling around Zhang Feng.

"Hahahaha, I didn't expect that after a few days, you're still so straightforward. Yes, actually, I called to talk about the cooperation issue with Tihao Group. Actually, when you came to see me before, I was thinking about it. I'm a soft-hearted person; if I can help, I definitely will. But there's one small problem..."

At this point, Zhang Feng paused, as if he were in a difficult situation. If Qi Yeyu was unaware, he would have thought something had happened to Zhang Feng.

"Oh? Director Zhang, what's the matter? You said my personality and temperament are straightforward. Now you're being evasive, which makes me uncomfortable. Let's not play games; I'll say it again: if Director Zhang can help us cooperate with Tihao Group, we will definitely offer generous rewards. This won't change!"

Qi Yeyu continued to promise and waited for Zhang Feng's response.

Chapter 440: Negotiations

At this point, the person on the other end of the phone chuckled and said, "Actually, your company's desire to cooperate with Tihao Group is something I can really help with. But regarding the conditions..."

At this point, Zhang Feng deliberately paused, as if waiting for Qi Yeyu's reaction.

Qi Yeyu immediately said, "Director Zhang, the conditions are whatever you want to propose. We will definitely fulfill your wishes if we can."

"Hahahaha, I knew you were generous. But there's something else in the middle. Chuang Rong Company also approached me and gave me a direct offer." At this point, Zhang Feng continued to stay silent. He was now fishing, hoping Qi Yeyu would get anxious and ask about this matter.

"Chuang Rong? Chuang Rong Company also approached you? What conditions did they offer? Tell me, we will definitely offer better terms than Chuang Rong!" Qi Yeyu continued with the plan he had previously designed.

Indeed, this pattern was Su Nantian's design from the beginning. He had already decided that to catch Zhang Feng, they must do it this way. So from the beginning, Su Nantian had specifically instructed Qi Yeyu and Yao Lao to approach Zhang Feng with two completely different methods.

Qi Yeyu's side was straightforward, like a new company without experience. Also, when he first promised benefits to Zhang Feng, he never promised specific numbers.

In contrast, Yao Lao's side took a completely different route. He was more of an old-timer, spoke in a roundabout way, and when proposing benefits, he directly gave a specific number.

This created a clear contrast in Zhang Feng's mind. He would naturally compare them, and the more he compared, the more his heart would be stirred. Eventually, he would still take the bait. Thus, now Qi Yeyu had called him.

As for why Zhang Feng called Qi Yeyu first, it was because Yao Lao's side had already proposed specific conditions. Thus, Yao Lao was his backup option.

But this did not mean Zhang Feng was dissatisfied with the conditions Yao Lao had proposed. On the contrary, it showed that Zhang Feng was very satisfied with the conditions Yao Lao had proposed. However, he still wanted to see if he could get better rewards from Qi Yeyu's side. Thus, Zhang Feng called Qi Yeyu and voluntarily revealed that Yao Lao's company had offered him conditions.

Hearing Qi Yeyu's anxious voice on the other end, Zhang Feng was extremely satisfied. He chuckled and said, "They said they would give me five million yuan and some other conditions. Their representative also told me that five million could be increased, but I hadn't agreed yet. What do you think?"

After saying this, Zhang Feng waited for Qi Yeyu's response. He should have already imagined Qi Yeyu's frantic reaction. After all, Chuang Rong was an old company; giving five million wasn't a big deal. But for Ke Mao, giving five million to Zhang Feng would require more funds for production later, which could be a problem.

But Zhang Feng didn't care about this at all. He considered this as his last payment in Tihao Group. Not only could he take the money from these two people now, but when starting to handle accounts, as the director of the finance department, he could also create false accounts and take a big profit.

Then after this, Zhang Feng planned to immediately run away. The rest of the matters would have nothing to do with him.

But Qi Yeyu's situation was completely different from what Zhang Feng had imagined. Zhang Feng's imagined frantic reaction didn't happen at all; instead, Qi Yeyu was sitting on the sofa sipping tea and looking very relaxed. Because Su Nantian had already predicted everything before this call, to him, it was like he was a prophet with full superiority. Now they were playing with Zhang Feng.

But Qi Yeyu still had to act. After sipping the tea, he immediately changed into a very anxious look and his voice became urgent.

"Director Zhang, you know Chuang Rong is an old-established company. But Ke Mao is a new company; our level and strength are first-rate. We guarantee that our quality will be much better than Chuang Rong's!"

"This... Ah, I know that new companies have a hard time surviving. But you also know I'm a businessman; although I work at Tihao Group, I still do things for myself. You can understand that, right? Chuang Rong offered five million; even I could ask for more. If you don't have sincerity, then I can only cooperate with Chuang Rong's people. Alright, that's it for today; I'll hang up now."

After saying this, Zhang Feng pretended to hang up the phone. Actually, he was waiting for Qi Yeyu's plea.

Zhang Feng had calculated clearly: companies like Chuang Rong, even if they couldn't cooperate with Tihao Group, still had their own ways to survive. But companies like Ke Mao, which were newly established, were basically gambling everything on this one shot. If they couldn't cooperate with Tihao Group now, they might be trampled underfoot later.

After all, the most important thing for a new company after establishment was to find a business that could boost morale quickly. Even if Chuang Rong offered five million, Zhang Feng wouldn't ask for more than six million. But for Ke Mao's company, maybe they could go a bit higher.

Zhang Feng's small calculations were extremely sharp. He was confident and waited for Qi Yeyu's response.

"Wait, wait! Director Zhang, don't hang up the phone yet. Of course, we can negotiate this! They offered you five million; naturally, we will come up with more than five million! How about six million? We are very sincere!" Qi Yeyu said immediately and spoke with an urgent tone, as if afraid that Zhang Feng would hang up the phone.

"Six million? I just said before, if it was with Chuang Rong, six million wouldn't be a problem," Zhang Feng said.

"We're not just giving you six million. After we start the transaction with Tihao Group, you can directly profit from it. The profits would be much higher than this," Qi Yeyu said, repeating what Su Nantian had told him.

Chapter 441: The Big Fish Bites

At this moment, Qi Yeyu truly admired Su Nantian. Initially, Qi Yeyu thought that Su Nantian was just like himself, with strength but no strategy. After all, Qi Yeyu was the one with the highest combat power in the secret organization. But why was Qi Yinzhen the leader? Because Qi Yinzhen had brains.

But now, Qi Yeyu realized that Su Nantian was not only strong but also wise and strategic. His strategies were even better than Qi Yinzhen's. Every word he spoke, every step he took had already been rehearsed by Su Nantian beforehand. It was almost perfect.

Qi Yeyu followed Su Nantian's instructions and negotiated with Zhang Feng. This was their last card, because six million plus business commission was completely different from just six million. Now, the conditions Qi Yeyu proposed meant that Zhang Feng could profit throughout this project, which was much better than just taking six million.

Although Qi Yeyu couldn't see Zhang Feng's expression on the other end of the phone, he knew that such an opportunity would be hard for Zhang Feng to resist. After all, Zhang Feng had called him specifically to get benefits from his side.

Indeed, Qi Yeyu's thoughts were correct. On the other end of the phone, Zhang Feng was already overjoyed. He had thought he could get a few million more from Ke Mao, but he hadn't expected that Ke Mao's company would directly let him get involved. The profits from this were obviously endless.

Moreover, Zhang Feng's plan was to take the money and leave after completing the initial procurement phase. Now, this idea had been further solidified.

Why did Su Nantian have Qi Yeyu from Ke Mao, a new company, do this? It was to make the situation reasonable. Although Yao Lao's Chuang Rong Company was well-known in Hangcheng, it was a long-established enterprise. Although it hadn't become the leader in Hangcheng, its deep-rooted foundation over many years was indeed solid.

If Yao Lao from Chuang Rong had told Zhang Feng six million plus commission, Zhang Feng might have truly refused. It would be obvious that they were playing him. But if it was a new company like Ke Mao, it would be genuine. Because new companies had tight funding in their initial stages and couldn't immediately mobilize so much liquidity. They could only use this method to increase their offers, thus winning Zhang Feng's trust.

"I can see your sincerity. If that's the case, I'm willing to help you," Zhang Feng cleared his throat and said.

Qi Yeyu showed an expression of "as expected." When Su Nantian had given him step-by-step instructions, Qi Yeyu had once asked Su Nantian, "What if Zhang Feng still isn't satisfied at this point? Should I increase the offer?" At that time, Su Nantian had said, "It's impossible. He will definitely agree at this point."

Indeed, Zhang Feng now truly agreed. This fish had bitten the hook.

"Really? Thank you very much, Director Zhang! I wish us a successful cooperation!" Qi Yeyu still pretended to be extremely happy.

"Ah, of course we need to cooperate. But let's set the rules first. The six million should be transferred in one go. If you don't trust us, we can transfer three million first, and then the other three after you sign the contract with Tihao Group. Once the project starts, I must take my commission immediately. Do you agree?"

Zhang Feng was still a veteran; he had already started negotiating more detailed conditions. After all, for him, it was about profit. He would choose whoever offered the most profit, whether it was Chuang Rong or Ke Mao.

So now he wanted to secure the conditions first before proceeding.

"This is definitely no problem. We can transfer it all at once, but we hope you will ensure that we sign the contract with Tihao Group first," Zhang Feng replied. Six million was already prepared by Su Nantian, and for him, it wasn't a big deal. Using six million as bait to catch this big fish was quite appropriate.

"Hahahaha, good! A generous company like yours will definitely achieve great success. So we are cooperating well. I'll start operating within Tihao Group in the next few days and bring you good news soon. Oh, before that, don't call me again; I'll contact you. Wait, I'll send the account details to you first. Then I'll hang up."

After Zhang Feng finished this last task, he immediately hung up the phone without any hesitation. He had no sentiment at all; after agreeing to the conditions, he hung up immediately, which seemed a bit like only caring about money.

But Qi Yeyu wasn't angry. Rather, as long as Zhang Feng had bitten the hook, it was fine.

So Qi Yeyu immediately hung up his phone and called Su Nantian.

"Master, the fish has bitten," Qi Yeyu said as soon as he heard the phone being answered.

Su Nantian, upon hearing this, couldn't help but show a happy expression and replied, "Good. Next, continue with the plan and try to get Zhang Feng within these few days."

After deploying the next steps with Qi Yeyu, Su Nantian hung up the phone. The time when Zhang Feng had bitten was earlier than Su Nantian had previously expected, but the sooner the better. Because Su Nantian was eager to go to Kyoto and had no time to waste, the sooner this matter was resolved, the better.

If it were delayed by ten or fifteen days, he would be too late when he arrived there.

Now that Zhang Feng had bitten the hook and quickly signed the contract to start the first business, it would be the time for Su Nantian to begin his net. Once all these matters were resolved, Su Nantian could go to Kyoto to thoroughly investigate the Wu family's affairs.

Su Nantian immediately sent signals to Qi Yinzhen and Yao Lao. Since Zhang Feng had already bitten the hook, the performance of the next steps must be well done; he could not give Zhang Feng any chance to escape. They had to completely defeat Zhang Feng here.

The secret organization was now monitoring Zhang Feng's home daily, watching his every move. Initially, Zhang Feng had tried to leave with his belongings but had temporarily postponed it due to various reasons. If Su Nantian's guess was correct, after this one-time profit, Zhang Feng would definitely run away.

Chapter 442: Reeling in the Net

Soon, Tihao Group and Ke Mao Company had reached a cooperation agreement and signed the contract. Qi Yeyu followed his initial negotiation with Zhang Feng, directly transferring six million yuan.

Of course, this was all arranged by fate. Zhang Feng had once asked Qi Yeyu to be lenient and let Ke Mao Company sign the contract with Tihao Group. Unexpectedly, Qi Yeyu had agreed quickly. This was naturally due to Su Nantian's instructions. However, Qi Yeyu had also asked for benefits from Zhang Feng; otherwise, it would have raised Zhang Feng's suspicions.

Even after receiving the six million yuan, Su Nantian did not immediately act. He was waiting for the first account turnover. Only after Zhang Feng had personally altered the accounts could Su Nantian have solid evidence to prove his interference. He could also use the investigation as a condition to force Zhang Feng to hand over all business department powers.

But Zhang Feng was unaware that he had already fallen into Su Nantian's trap. He was eager to alter the first batch of account entries, and the first batch often involved the largest expenditures.

After Zhang Feng had completed his accounts in no time, Su Nantian immediately took them. After carefully checking them, he found the loopholes and collected the materials before calmly walking with Qi Yinzhen to Zhang Feng's office.

Qi Yinzhen knocked on the door of Zhang Feng's office. A voice came from inside, "Who is it?"

"It's me," Qi Yinzhen replied.

Zhang Feng obviously recognized Qi Yinzhen's voice. Without him saying his name, he knew who it was and immediately called out, "Come in quickly. The door isn't locked."

Because they had previously cooperated, Zhang Feng was quite attentive to Qi Yinzhen. He didn't know that when the door opened, there wasn't just Qi Yinzhen but also Su Nantian behind him.

"Chairman, why have you come? If there's something you need from me, you can call me and I'll come personally," Zhang Feng immediately stood up from his chair upon seeing Su Nantian and walked over politely.

Su Nantian didn't immediately get angry but smiled and sat down on the chair Zhang Feng had originally occupied.

Qi Yinzhen stood beside Su Nantian.

Who was Zhang Feng? He had been in the business world for over a decade. He could immediately tell that Su Nantian was not here with good intentions.

"What's the matter, Chairman? Why have you come to see me today?" Zhang Feng could only ask with a forced smile.

Su Nantian smiled and waved his hand, indicating Qi Yinzhen beside him to pass something over.

Qi Yinzhen immediately threw the document he was holding onto the desk upon receiving Su Nantian's instructions.

"Look for yourself," Su Nantian said.

"What is this? It's so mysterious." Zhang Feng smiled and opened the document on the desk. When he saw the document in front of him, his face immediately changed; his brows furrowed, and his face turned pale. His smile disappeared.

"This..." Zhang Feng didn't know what to say, stammering for a while.

"Is there anything else you want to say? This account was made by yourself, right? You're fooling me. The accounts of Tihao Group are like this; where did the missing money go? Do you think no one will check the accounts?" Su Nantian didn't get angry but calmly spoke each word.

Su Nantian's calmness made Zhang Feng feel even colder inside. He knew this young man was no ordinary person; he had already eliminated Li Hounian before, and now he could definitely eliminate himself. He even vaguely felt that Li Hounian's departure from here was not because of himself but because he had been calculated by Su Nantian.

"I..." Zhang Feng's mind was spinning rapidly; he needed to come up with a reasonable explanation.

"Enough, don't make excuses. Qi Yinzhen told me already; you definitely took money from Ke Mao Company to help them secure this contract, right? Qi Yinzhen, how much did you get?" Su Nantian said and pointed to Qi Yinzhen standing beside him, asking him to speak.

Zhang Feng looked at Qi Yinzhen with angry eyes. He had used various methods to get Qi Yinzhen to decide on using Ke Mao Company, and of the six million yuan, two million had been given to Qi Yinzhen.

After all, Qi Yinzhen was the head of the business department. Although Su Nantian had the final say, it was Qi Yinzhen who decided what kind of strengths each company showed and what Su Nantian could see.
