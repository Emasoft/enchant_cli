Leng Boxiong snorted in disdain before personally carrying a share transfer document to Song Lichen's side, smiling as he said, "Mr. Song, take a look at this first-round share transfer document; please keep it."

"Very well, thank you," Song Lichen replied politely, offering a nod. There was no trace of the lofty arrogance typically associated with the Kyoto Song family.

Such individuals, who managed branch offices and accepted business engagements effortlessly, naturally cultivated a polished demeanor. To anyone, Song Lichen could maintain this composed attitude.

"Enough with the flattery—hurry up, next! Next!"

Su Nantian stood in the center of the arena, hands on his hips, declaring.

"Wang Jun, you're up. Don't act as recklessly as Su La did; remember what I told you earlier." Qi Yinzhen patted the shoulder of a towering figure beside him. Wang Jun stood at approximately two meters tall, his frame massive and imposing, like a mountain.

Su Nantian observed the towering figure stepping onto the platform and chuckled, remarking, "Ah, your five-person team has a good division of roles. The previous short one was fast due to his height, but now you've brought this hulking giant. He's a living tank. But no one can save you— I'll knock all of you down!"

Wang Jun's massive physique suggested he followed a power-oriented fighting style. Such individuals would inevitably lack the speed of Su La.

Yet Wang Jun was far more composed than Su La; if it had been the previous opponent, he would have already exploded into fury after hearing Su Nantian's words. However, Wang Jun remained as steady as a mountain.

"Begin!"

Song Lichen called again.

"Remember what I said—don't be as reckless as Su La!" Qi Yinzhen shouted immediately, still uneasy but reassured that Wang Jun was far more level-headed than Su La and unlikely to be provoked.

Su Nantian observed the towering figure standing before him, yet he made no move; the giant stood motionless as if unwilling to act.

"Why aren't you moving, big guy? I'm just standing here," Su Nantian inquired curiously. He remained utterly unguarded, as if no defense existed.

"If you don't move first, I won't either. When you strike, I shall respond," Wang Jun replied.

"You're quite sharp—playing military tactics here?" Su Nantian shook his head with a smile. Yet no matter how the giant attempted to feign mystery, it was useless; Su Nantian remained unaffected.

"If you won't move, then I shall!" Su Nantian shouted before charging toward the giant.

"Too fast—too fast! I can't even see!" Qi Yinzhen was stunned the moment Su Nantian moved.

Su Nantian's form became nothing more than a blur of shadows, his trajectory impossible to track. Even Wang Jun on the platform could not discern his movements.

Wang Jun stood frozen, bewildered by Su Nantian's disappearance.

Before the match, Qi Yinzhen had devised a plan for each participant, instructing them on how to exhaust Su Nantian's stamina. The goal was for the first four fighters to drain his energy, creating an optimal environment for Qi Yeyu's final clash. However, it now seemed all was futile.

Initially, Qi Yinzhen had ordered Su La to exploit his speed, harassing Su Nantian relentlessly. If Su Nantian couldn't catch him, he would exhaust himself. Yet Su Nantian had simply knocked Su La out with a single punch.

Wang Jun's massive frame made him ideal for aggressive attacks and endurance; ordinary punches barely affected him. Moreover, his immense strength allowed him to seize Su Nantian for counterattacks.

Yet now, all these strategies had crumbled into nothingness. Wang Jun could not track Su Nantian's movements; one moment he glimpsed a shadow, and the next, Su Nantian had vanished. Wang Jun spun wildly on the platform, unable to locate Su Nantian.

In fact, this shadow was deliberately left for Wang Jun to see, allowing Su Nantian to toy with him. If he wished to remain unseen entirely, he could have done so effortlessly.

Wang Jun's massive body spun endlessly on the platform.

Finally, he collapsed from exhaustion, unable to locate Su Nantian and spinning uncontrollably.

"Right now!" Suddenly, he heard Su Nantian's voice and felt a knife strike to his neck.

Next, Wang Jun's vision darkened, and he collapsed onto the platform with a thud.

Chapter 392: Silver Needles

"There's no point in this— I assume you sent that short one first to deal with me. But his speed was too slow, even failing to match mine. How could he possibly win? And this hulking giant— also no good. Who's your third fighter? What tricks do you have left? Hurry up and come out!"

Su Nantian waved at the crowd below, laughing as he dismissed them entirely.

"Mr. Leng," Song Lichen smiled and extended his hand toward Leng Boxiong, signaling for the second share transfer document.

Leng Boxiong's heart boiled with rage, yet he still had to bow respectfully before Song Lichen. He immediately handed over the second share transfer document.

At this point, 40% of Ti Hao Group's shares now belonged to Su Nantian.

"This is truly arrogant. I must go and teach him a lesson," remarked an elderly man standing beside Qi Yinzhen at that moment.

Before the elder could ascend the platform, Qi Yinzhen grabbed his sleeve and said, "Master Yao, be careful. This kid isn't easy to handle. Perhaps I should take his place instead; our plan was too flawed, and everything has been shattered."

"Leave it to me. My silver needles will make this kid suffer. Even if I fail, as long as they pierce him, they'll block his power. You'll have an easier time afterward."

With that, the elder leaped onto the platform.

Though he appeared aged, his movements were surprisingly agile; he cleared the two-meter-high stage effortlessly.

"Kid, don't think winning two matches makes you arrogant. We暗刺 (Shadow Assassins) also have masters beyond your comprehension," the elder, known as Master Yao, said, stroking his beard. His demeanor was refined, like that of an ancient sage.

Su Nantian glanced at the elder before saying, "What's wrong with your Shadow Assassins? You don't even respect elders. This old man is so aged, yet you send him to fight? I dare not strike at all. If I accidentally injure him, what would I do?"

Indeed, Su Nantian saw the elder as frail and weak. If he fought like before, this old man would likely be crushed by a single punch.

"Hmph! Arrogant brat! Your arrogance will be your tombstone! Take this!"

The elder suddenly extended his hand, and several silver needles appeared at his fingertips.

At this moment, Su Nantian finally understood the elder's tactic— he was using hidden weapons. Combined with Qi Yinzhen calling him "Master Yao," it confirmed the elder's expertise in both medicine and hidden weapons.

"How dare you bring hidden weapons? Isn't that a violation?" Su Nantian hadn't expected the man to use silver needles.

Indeed, dealing with silver needles was complicated; they were thin and difficult to discern mid-air.

"But we didn't mention a ban on hidden weapons during our previous matches," Leng Boxiong shouted, stretching his neck. After losing two rounds, his mood was terrible, but now that Su Nantian seemed afraid of the hidden weapons, he regained his vigor.

"Mr. Song, do you agree with me? We never mentioned a ban on hidden weapons before," Leng Boxiong added, asking Song Lichen's opinion.

Song Lichen pondered briefly before nodding, "Mr. Leng is correct. We didn't specify a ban on hidden weapons during our rule-making. Since it's an attack method, it doesn't constitute a violation. Su Nantian, do you have any objections?"

Song Lichen knew Su Nantian's skills were beyond hidden weapons, so he followed Leng Boxiong's words to maintain impartiality.

"Fine, fine— if that’s the case, then proceed," Su Nantian waved his hand, accepting the situation.

"Thank you, Mr. Song, for upholding justice," Leng Boxiong rubbed his hands, grinning. He felt this time had a chance; Su Nantian was clearly afraid of hidden weapons, and the odds were high.

"Kid, be careful!" Master Yao spoke before launching his silver needles— six of them flying toward Su Nantian's six different acupoints.

Su Nantian saw the needles and their placement immediately understood their intent.

Master Yao's strike wasn't a killing move but aimed to block Su Nantian’s acupoints, significantly weakening his power. If one acupoint was blocked, Su Nantian would feel powerless and helpless, leaving him at their mercy.

But how could Master Yao succeed? Su Nantian used his speed to dodge, then circled around the elder for a punch— just like before.

Yet Su Nantian hadn't anticipated Master Yao's speed was no slower; the elder moved almost simultaneously, firing another dozen silver needles while moving.

These needles weren't just aimed at Su Nantian's acupoints but also blocked his path. Thus, if Su Nantian tried to dodge, he'd only face more needles.

Su Nantian knew the elder's plan and frowned, instantly halting his movement before leaping backward to evade the needles— none hit him.

"Kid, your reflexes are quick. Watch this!" Master Yao wasn't slow either; he fired another dozen silver needles "swooshing" toward Su Nantian's current position.

The silver needles gleamed as they shot at Su Nantian, but this time, they all missed, striking the pillars behind the platform instead.

"Close call," Su Nantian sighed, feigning wiping his forehead, though not a single drop of sweat was present.

Chapter 393: Voluntary Surrender

"Perhaps this time has a chance," Qi Yinzhen remarked, observing Master Yao's performance.

Su Nantian now moved passively, entirely guided by Master Yao’s silver needles.

If Master Yao could maintain control of the match, he would eventually pierce Su Nantian’s acupoints.

Moreover, this strategy had effectively drained Su Nantian's strength. Even if Master Yao failed to win, the silver needles would exhaust Su Nantian significantly.

"Kid, now you know my silver needles' power, right? Don’t dare speak arrogantly. People shouldn't be overly self-confident— especially the young, who need to learn humility and patience."

Master Yao smiled before shaking his silver needles. Clearly, he had the upper hand in this round.

Yet Su Nantian remained indifferent, showing no concern for Master Yao’s words.

"What did you say? Do you think you’ve won? This was just playing around. You’re really overstepping— disrespecting elders is truly shameful."

Su Nantian laughed as he spoke.

Seeing Su Nantian's attitude, Master Yao was enraged.

"You insolent kid— I didn’t want to fight seriously, but now I have no choice but to teach you a lesson."

Master Yao angrily shot his silver needles toward Su Nantian.

But these were just a few needles, easily dodged by Su Nantian.

"Hahahaha, you’re called Master Yao? Does that mean your medical skills are exceptional?"

After evading the needles, Su Nantian asked.

"Exceptional is too strong a word, but I am confident in my medical skills. Once you’re pierced by my silver needles, there’s no way back. I advise you to apologize now; I’ll be merciful and not take your life."

Master Yao said this while stroking his beard, confident in his abilities.

"You’re truly arrogant and shameless. Why don’t you try to feel your own condition?"

Su Nantian raised his right hand, revealing two silver needles in it.

Seeing Su Nantian’s needles, Master Yao was startled— when had this kid retrieved his silver needles?

Suddenly, Master Yao gasped. Did this kid also fire needles at him?

He then searched his body, checking for any signs of being pierced.

But after searching repeatedly, he found no abnormalities on his body.

"You’re just playing tricks!" Master Yao shouted angrily.

"Playing tricks? I think it’s your own foolishness. You still haven’t realized where the needles are— you’re truly beyond help."

After saying this, Su Nantian pointed at Master Yao’s hand.

At that moment, Master Yao realized four silver needles were embedded in his hands, gleaming with a silvery light. However, due to inertia, he had assumed Su Nantian aimed for his body and hadn’t noticed the needles were actually embedded in his hands.

Moreover, these acupoints were crucial to the human body.

"Your qihai (sea of vital energy) has been sealed. Without my treatment, you’ll suffer from poor circulation, often experiencing headaches and fevers, even spitting blood. This illness will accompany you for the rest of your life."

Su Nantian said this before tossing his remaining needles to the ground.

To challenge Su Nantian’s medical skills was truly foolish; his medical expertise was unparalleled, far beyond ordinary people. Master Yao was merely a novice in this field, yet he dared threaten Su Nantian with a few needles.

"I lose. Please treat me."

Master Yao, understanding medical skills, realized his four acupoints were sealed by Su Nantian. He immediately checked his body and confirmed it was as Su Nantian said— a significant隐患 (hidden danger).

"Treating is simple, but it requires my unique techniques. However, I’m currently in a match, so you’ll have to wait until it’s over and show your sincerity then."

Su Nantian smiled after saying this, then asked Song Lichen below the platform: "How about it? Did I win this round? He’s already surrendered."

Song Lichen asked Master Yao on the platform: "Have you surrendered?"

Master Yao nodded, saying, "Yes, I have."

He wasn’t foolish; he knew Su Nantian’s medical and combat skills were superior. Continuing would be pointless.

Moreover, his qihai was sealed by Su Nantian and required treatment— what use was there in continuing?

"You! You took my money, so you must continue fighting. I didn’t say you lost— you can’t leave unless you’re knocked out like the first two!"

Leng Boxiong was relentless. Master Yao could still fight, but it wasn’t proper to surrender now.

"This match no longer needs to continue; I’ve lost."

After saying this, Master Yao leaped off the platform and returned to Qi Yinzhen’s side.

"Sorry, I’ve also lost. The rest is up to you two." Master Yao said apologetically.

Qi Yinzhen shook his head and patted his shoulder: "There’s no need for that now. After this, we’ll have Su Nantian treat you. You’ve lost— leave it at that and let the rest handle it."

Qi Yinzhen knew Master Yao’s medical expertise. If even he couldn’t cure his condition, only Su Nantian could help.

Thus, this match ended without further words.

Leng Boxiong reluctantly handed another share transfer document to Song Lichen.

At this point, Ti Hao Group’s majority shares were now under Su Nantian's control.

Even with the current situation, Leng Boxiong had already lost primary influence over Ti Hao Group.

"You must win now— no more chances left. If you don’t, I’ll make sure to get back at you!"

Leng Boxiong now clearly panicked, shouting loudly.

Qi Yinzhen nodded and said, "Then it’s my turn."

He then stepped onto the platform.

Chapter 394: Withdrawal

Qi Yinzhen had already calculated in his mind. He observed Su Nantian’s first three matches and knew he was definitely no match for him.

Perhaps only Qi Yeyu of the Shadow Assassins could fight against him.

But this was merely Qi Yinzhen’s speculation, as he still hadn’t discovered Su Nantian's true strength.

"Your turn— finish it quickly; this is the fourth match, and I think it’s about to end," Su Nantian said as Qi Yinzhen approached.

"Then let’s go."

No further words, Qi Yinzhen waved to Su Nantian.

Actually, Su Nantian was already tired of the matches; after several rounds, he had lost patience. Initially, he wanted to play with them, but now he just wished for a quick end and to obtain the share transfer documents.

One punch— only one punch— Su Nantian struck Qi Yinzhen directly to the ground.

Qi Yinzhen had no chance to fight back, but he remained conscious and hadn’t fainted like Su La and Wang Jun.

However, his vision was already blurred, and he lacked strength— his head buzzed so much he couldn’t stand.

Qi Yinzhen hadn’t expected to last even a single punch against Su Nantian.

"What a bunch of useless organization! You’re all so weak!"

Leng Boxiong was furious; these were people he had paid a fortune to hire, yet they all fell in one round against Su Nantian.

"You’re a bunch of useless people— did you collude with Su Nantian to steal my shares!"

Leng Boxiong cursed.

"Mr. Leng, don’t speak so harshly. If you say our strength is lacking, we admit defeat. But now you’re suspecting us."

Qi Yeyu grabbed Leng Boxiong’s shoulder and squeezed it, applying pressure upward. One could even hear the sound of his bones creaking.

"Ah! Ah! Let go— I said the wrong thing. I apologize to you," Leng Boxiong winced in pain and quickly apologized, begging Qi Yeyu.

Qi Yeyu finally released his grip and said to Su Nantian on the platform: "I think we don’t need to fight anymore. I surrender."

Qi Yeyu knew he was no match for Su Nantian. He and Qi Yinzhen were evenly matched, but even if he was slightly stronger than Qi Yinzhen, after seeing Qi Yinzhen fall to one punch, he knew he couldn’t match Su Nantian.

"You! This…!"

Leng Boxiong was furious upon hearing Qi Yeyu’s surrender, but he stopped mid-sentence after recalling the pain from Qi Yeyu squeezing his shoulder.

"Mr. Leng, we’ll return the payment we received to you in full. Of course, we’ll deduct medical expenses for a few of our brothers. The rest we won’t take— we can’t accept this job anymore."

Qi Yeyu spoke decisively.

Wisdom is knowing when to yield; they weren’t fools. There was no point in fighting after discovering Su Nantian’s strength.

"Then, Mr. Leng, do you have anyone left to fight? If not, it’ll be a forfeit."

Song Lichen immediately asked.

At this moment, where could Leng Boxiong find anyone? He had hired the Shadow Assassins. This was a costly hire, but now they all had lost their courage against Su Nantian and refused to fight.

Leng Boxiong had many bodyguards behind him, but their skills were no match for the Shadow Assassins. Fighting them would only result in being beaten.

"You should think carefully— if you lose, you’ll have to hand over the share transfer documents."

Song Lichen smiled with narrowed eyes. Su Nantian’s victory was even simpler than he had imagined.

"What… what am I supposed to do now?" Leng Boxiong only had the Shadow Assassins in mind, with no backup plan.

Moreover, he had spent a fortune to hire the Shadow Assassins— how could there be an alternative?

"If that’s the case, you’ll have to surrender. Or you can fight yourself— but I don’t think you’ll win."

Song Lichen smiled, tapping his cane repeatedly. The scene was too amusing.

Actually, Song Lichen was also amazed by Su Nantian’s abilities. The entire Shadow Assassins had given up on fighting Su Nantian— it was unbelievable.

"I think Mr. Song’s suggestion is good. Why don’t you, Mr. Leng, come up and fight me?" Su Nantian said after hearing Song Lichen’s words, then patted the platform railing and waved at Leng Boxiong.

Leng Boxiong was filled with hatred, but he dared not fight Su Nantian. The Shadow Assassins had all lost to him; what could he do?

"You! Come up!" Leng Boxiong turned around and shouted at his bodyguards.

"I… I won’t go!" The bodyguard immediately pulled away from Leng Boxiong and stepped aside.

Although Leng Boxiong was his boss, this was a death trap. He wanted to live and knew that even the high-level fighters who had fought Su Nantian before couldn’t win. The Shadow Assassins had already given up, so why would he go to his death?

"Who will come up! If you win, I’ll give you five million!" Leng Boxiong shouted desperately.

Five million was tempting, but the bodyguards remained motionless; they knew it was impossible.

"One million!" Leng Boxiong increased the stakes again.

"Five million!" Five million was a staggering sum, but still no one came up.

Five million was painful for Leng Boxiong, but if no one fought, he would lose Ti Hao Group— the loss was far greater.

Moreover, he had only paid two million to hire the Shadow Assassins, but even raising it to five million didn’t move them.

They knew Su Nantian’s strength and wouldn’t be foolish enough to become the victim.

Without five million, and a guaranteed beating, they chose to stay put.

Especially since Master Yao still needed Su Nantian’s help for treatment.

Chapter 395: Recruitment

No matter how high a price Leng Boxiong offered, no one stood up to fight Su Nantian.

Song Lichen could only smile and say, "Mr. Leng, it seems no one is willing to fight for you. What will you do now? Will you come up yourself, or should this end here?"

Ending here meant Leng Boxiong would hand over the final share transfer document, and Ti Hao Group would fully belong to Su Nantian.

"I… I know," Leng Boxiong knew he had no choice. He would never fight Su Nantian— that would mean losing Ti Hao Group’s shares and even paying medical expenses. Plus, he had signed a death contract; his life might be at risk.

Leng Boxiong slumped onto the chair, recovering after a while before carefully retrieving the final share transfer document from his briefcase and handing it to Song Lichen.

Normally, Leng Boxiong would have refused, but this time he couldn’t— the witness was Kyoto Song. Unless he wanted to lose his life and never be able to hold his head high again, he couldn’t defy the rules.

Moreover, if he truly broke the agreement in front of Song Lichen, the Song family would likely retaliate. This was a blow to their dignity.

Song Lichen took the final share transfer document and stood up, addressing everyone present: "The result of this match is now clear. The final round saw Mr. Leng’s withdrawal due to no one answering the challenge. Thus, Su Nantian wins and will acquire 100% of Ti Hao Group’s shares. Finally, Mr. Leng and Su Nantian must sign these five share transfer documents."

After hearing this, Su Nantian immediately jumped off the platform and approached Song Lichen, quickly signing his name on all five share transfer documents.

"It’s your turn— don’t back out," he said, handing the signed documents to Leng Boxiong.

Once Leng Boxiong signed, Ti Hao Group’s shares would fully belong to him.

Leng Boxiong could only reluctantly pick up his pen and sign the five share transfer documents. Though he wanted to back out or act defiant, he knew he couldn’t.

He could certainly feud with Su Nantian and become an enemy, but he dared not offend the Kyoto Song family.

Seeing Leng Boxiong complete the documents, Su Nantian clapped his hands and said, "Then I’ll take Ti Hao Group. Thank you for being so kind."

After saying this, he walked over and patted Leng Boxiong’s shoulder.

Leng Boxiong, despite his intense hatred for Su Nantian, had to restrain himself.

"Alright, Mr. Song, the mission is complete. We can leave now," Su Nantian waved his share transfer documents and prepared to depart with Song Lichen.

As Su Nantian and Song Lichen were about to leave the warehouse, Qi Yeyu approached.

"Su Nantian, please wait!"

"What else is there? You’ve already withdrawn. Do you want to fight again?"

Su Nantian smiled as he spoke, unafraid of another match.

"No, we’ve already withdrawn and won’t fight you again. We know your strength is beyond ours. We have self-awareness. But we beg you to save our Master Yao."

Qi Yeyu pointed at Master Yao, who was now bleeding from his nose.

Su Nantian’s four acupoints had taken effect quickly.

Master Yao, an expert in medicine himself, knew his body was deteriorating.

"Oh, you mean him? I almost forgot. But I don’t have the antidote yet— I need to go back and make it again. Today, it’s impossible. Let me think about it— come to Ti Hao Group tomorrow."

Su Nantian said this with a hint of meaning, then smiled and left with Song Lichen.

Qi Yeyu understood the implication behind Su Nantian’s final smile, but he was unsure. In their organization, Qi Yinzhen was the most astute.

"Yinzhen, did you hear what Su Nantian said? What did he mean?"

Qi Yinzhen had just recovered from the punch Su Nantian delivered.

"He wants us to consider joining him— this is a recruitment," Qi Yinzhen nodded.

"What do you think…"

Before Qi Yeyu could finish, Qi Yinzhen waved his hand to signal Leng Boxiong was nearby.

"You all are useless— you’ve cost me my Ti Hao Group!"

After Song Lichen left, Leng Boxiong immediately cursed the Shadow Assassins.

"Mr. Leng, we’re only in a contractual relationship. The task was too difficult for us to complete; we can only admit defeat. Also, I said earlier that I’ll return your payment in full— of course, deducting our brothers’ medical expenses."

Qi Yeyu spoke without fear or submission. They were only in a contractual relationship; neither owed the other anything. Returning their payment was unrelated to them.

"You’ll compensate me for my Ti Hao Group!"

Leng Boxiong now started to act defiant, demanding the Shadow Assassins compensate him for his loss.

"Don’t be ungrateful. Even if you find another organization, they’ll fail too. You should reflect on why you met this iron wall— as a businessman, making enemies everywhere shows your foolishness."

Qi Yeyu and his group weren’t afraid of Leng Boxiong.

The Shadow Assassins were among the top ten organizations nationwide; they weren’t afraid of Leng Boxiong’s retaliation. Moreover, after today, Leng Boxiong was destitute— where would he get the money to retaliate?

"Take a few brothers and leave. Tonight, we’ll settle down and see if we need to find Su Nantian tomorrow."

Qi Yeyu told his group, and they immediately carried the injured members out of the warehouse.

Only Leng Boxiong remained, sitting motionless. Ti Hao Group had changed hands today— even this warehouse no longer belonged to him.

One day, one day alone had cost him his greatest industry.

And the most absurd part was— it was all due to a gamble.

Chapter 396: Taking Over

A single match allowed Su Nantian to claim all shares of Ti Hao Group.

Su Nantian didn’t waste time; after the match, he immediately took Song Lichen to Ti Hao Group’s headquarters.

Actually, Su Nantian brought Song Lichen as a gesture of courtesy— he knew if he went alone, Ti Hao Group’s people wouldn’t believe him. But with the Kyoto Song family as witnesses, they would trust he had truly acquired all shares of Ti Hao Group.

On the way, Su Nantian called Zhang Bao immediately.

"Big brother, what’s your command?"

Zhang Bao, recognizing the call was from Su Nantian, respectfully asked.

At that time, Leng Boxiong’s son was under Zhang Bao’s custody.

So Su Nantian said, "Zhang Bao, take Leng Boxiong’s son to Ti Hao Group immediately."

"Ah? Big brother, are you releasing his son?"

Zhang Bao was confused; he thought Su Nantian wanted to release Leng Zhi Fei.

"Let’s talk about it later— just bring the person over."

Su Nantian smiled; he didn’t want to tell Zhang Bao about the match results yet.

Zhang Bao, seeing Su Nantian so confident, didn’t say more and only nodded: "Yes, big brother. I’ll bring them over immediately."

As Su Nantian hung up the phone, Song Lichen smiled and said, "You’re really cunning. Not only did you take over their Ti Hao Group, but now you’re bringing Leng Boxiong’s son to visit— how are you handing it over?"

Su Nantian's subtle plan was immediately discovered by Song Lichen.

After hearing this, Su Nantian chuckled and said, "I just want them to know the consequences of opposing me— not only will he suffer punishment, but even his father must kneel before me."
