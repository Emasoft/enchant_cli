Su Nantian could not comprehend why Nan Gong Lin insisted on sending him to the Inland Port. However, for Su Nantian, this was not entirely unfavorable; if he went to the Inland Port, he could interact with other martial artists of the Nan Gong family. Perhaps this would give him more confidence in his rescue plan.

When Su Nantian was about to say something further, Nan Gong Lin waved his hand and said, "Enough. There's no need to argue about this anymore. My decision is final. Pack your things and prepare. Go directly to the Inland Port in two days. Once there, do your best. If you can achieve results, there will be more rewards. That's all. I called you here for this matter alone. You may leave now."

After Nan Gong Lin said these words, he gave Su Nantian no chance to react. A steward stepped forward and escorted Su Nantian out of the door.

Thus, Su Nantian was effectively "sent" out by Nan Gong Lin.

"Lao Ye," the steward asked, "sending this person to the Inland Port might be risky. After all, the Inland Port is now a crucial project for our Nan Gong family. The profits we gain this year depend on how well we manage it. Sending someone like him there—"

Before the steward could finish, Nan Gong Lin waved his hand and said, "I know. I will send another person as well. I sent him to the Inland Port merely to see what his true intentions are. He has been saying that Nan Gong Ping seems quite honest, but if I leave him alone in the Inland Port, he might do what he wants to do.

As for the normal operations of the Inland Port, they should be entrusted to Yu Yan. At the same time, I will send someone else to monitor it. By the way, who do you think would be suitable for this task?"

The Nan Gong family's steward was surprised that Nan Gong Lin had asked him such a question. He pondered for a moment and shook his head, "Master, I truly cannot think of anyone suitable. However, I believe you already have a person in mind."

"Didn't Nan Gong Fei always want a position before? Let him go this time. Let's see what kind of tricks he can pull."

The Nan Gong Fei mentioned by Nan Gong Lin was his nephew, who had always been idle and hadn't even finished university. He constantly pestered Nan Gong Lin to give him a position.

But how could Nan Gong Lin allow such a person to manage the family's affairs? Without any background knowledge or experience, he would only cause losses for the Nan Gong family.

Thus, this time Nan Gong Lin had finally found something for him to do: to follow Su Nantian and see what he was up to in the Inland Port. However, the greatest power would still be entrusted to Nan Gong Yu Yan, so there was no need to worry at all.

After hearing this, the steward smiled and said, "Master truly has a sharp mind. This way, we have someone monitoring Su Nantian and also silencing Nan Gong Fei. He has always been discontent with you, blaming you for being heartless and not giving him a position. This has even caused your brother to hold grudges against you. Now, all these problems are solved. Although Nan Gong Fei is not good at doing things, monitoring a person should be no problem."

After hearing the steward's words, Nan Gong Lin nodded in agreement. This was exactly what he had thought. Moreover, Nan Gong Fei could be considered a member of the Nan Gong family; he would never collude with outsiders. Therefore, sending him to monitor Su Nantian was the most suitable choice.

"Then let's proceed as I said. Go and inform Nan Gong Fei to prepare in the next few days. When he takes over, that's his only chance. If he doesn't seize it, don't come to me again."

After saying this, Nan Gong Lin put down his things and went upstairs.

Meanwhile, Su Nantian returned to Nan Gong Ping's villa. At that moment, Nan Gong Ping was still sitting in the living room. Upon seeing him return, he immediately stood up and said, "Nantian, why did your father call you over?"

It seemed Nan Gong Ping had been waiting for him all along, just to ask this question. After all, no one knew why Nan Gong Lin had called Su Nantian over this time.

Previously, when Su Nantian went there, it was understandable. After all, due to negligence in guarding, Nan Gong Ping had been injured. But this time, Su Nantian had performed well recently. It was worrying that Nan Gong Lin had called him over without reason.

Su Nantian smiled and said to Nan Gong Ping, "It's nothing, Master. My father sent me there as a reward. I made a small achievement today in the Inland Port. Also, one more thing..."

At this point, Su Nantian showed a hesitant expression, as if unsure how to say it.

This made Nan Gong Ping even more anxious. He immediately patted Su Nantian's shoulder and said, "Nantian, just say it. What else did he want from you?"

"This... My father said that Master doesn't need a bodyguard during this period of rest. He asked me to go temporarily to the Inland Port." Su Nantian directly repeated Nan Gong Lin's words. After all, Nan Gong Ping would inevitably find out anyway; there was no need to hide it.

Chapter 560: Suspicion

After hearing Su Nantian's words, Nan Gong Ping looked puzzled. After a while, he said, "Why does my father always send you to strange places? Does he have some unresolved issue or bias against you? Could it be because you hit Zeng Chao, so he's treating you this way? Even if that incident has already passed for so long, and you also went to the Sea King Gang and helped our Nan Gong family achieve a feat, why is he still holding a grudge? There must be some hidden truth here."

Nan Gong Ping finally realized something was wrong. He had previously thought his father's targeting of Su Nantian was due to the fight where Su Nantian had injured Zeng Chao. Although everyone in the Nan Gong family now acknowledged that Su Nantian's martial arts were far superior to Zeng Chao's, for Nan Gong Lin, Zeng Chao was his right-hand man. Zeng Chao had followed him for over a decade and was very trustworthy, having also contributed greatly. He maintained the entire Nan Gong family's security system, so Nan Gong Lin valued him very much.

Previously, during the fight between Zeng Chao and Su Nantian, Zeng Chao had been injured by Su Nantian. He was hospitalized and underwent surgery for several days, which made Nan Gong Lin angry. However, Nan Gong Ping was puzzled because Su Nantian had already been punished for it, and he had also achieved a feat. Why was his father still holding such resentment? According to Nan Gong Ping's understanding of his father, it shouldn't be like this. Therefore, now that Nan Gong Lin was still doing things that seemed to target Su Nantian specifically, it made Nan Gong Ping suspect whether there was something wrong with Su Nantian himself. Hence, he said these words.

Even though Nan Gong Ping had always protected Su Nantian, if it involved other issues of the Nan Gong family or if Su Nantian was actually planning to harm them, he would never protect him.

Therefore, now Nan Gong Ping looked at Su Nantian with a very suspicious gaze, hoping to get an answer from him.

After seeing Nan Gong Ping's gaze, Su Nantian felt things were getting awkward. He had always known that Nan Gong Ping would definitely support him, but he had overlooked one thing: when Nan Gong Lin suspected himself, Nan Gong Ping would never protect him.

"I don't know what's going on," Su Nantian could only say.

But in fact, Su Nantian had no intention of harming the Nan Gong family. He simply wanted to use the Nan Gong family's status to interact with the Wu family and carry out his plan. He had no intention of doing anything against the Nan Gong family, nor would he harm them.

When Su Nantian spoke, his gaze was very determined, and his whole body showed no signs of anything unusual. Therefore, Nan Gong Ping had some trust in him. However, he also knew his father's suspicions were not baseless. He had always admired Nan Gong Lin since childhood, because Nan Gong Lin was not only skilled but also had a sharp mind. In many situations, he could control the overall situation and always prevailed.

Therefore, if Nan Gong Lin truly suspected Su Nantian, it meant that there was something fishy about him. His actions must be questionable.

"I can't help you with this. You need to prove yourself and dispel my father's suspicions. Since he sent you to the Inland Port, go there. This time, prove your loyalty to the Nan Gong family again. Then he won't suspect you anymore." After saying this, Nan Gong Ping patted Su Nantian's shoulder for encouragement.

Su Nantian knew he couldn't escape this situation. He could only nod, but thinking about it, this might not be a bad thing for Su Nantian. If he could handle the internal affairs well this time, dispelling his father's suspicions, then he could get closer to the Wu family through the Nan Gong family.

"So you can rest assured. I will definitely do my best this time. I don't know why my father suspects me, or what he suspects about me. But since I am now a member of the Nan Gong family, I must do things for the Nan Gong family. I will show my father that I am definitely not what he imagines."

After hearing Su Nantian's words, Nan Gong Ping was also moved and said, "It's great that you think this way. If you succeed this time, plus the things you've done for the Nan Gong family before, I believe my father will understand. Perhaps because you have been too prominent recently, after all, my father has to control the entire Nan Gong family. So he would be cautious about any unusual matters."

After saying this, Nan Gong Ping patted Su Nantian's shoulder again. "Rest well." Then he left the living room and went to his own room.

Meanwhile, Su Nantian returned to his room. He realized he knew nothing about the Inland Port now, but this was within the Wu family's domain and something he needed to understand.

Moreover, he must handle this matter well to prove his loyalty to the Nan Gong family. Therefore, before going to the Inland Port dock, he must first gather information about the situation there and find out who truly controlled it.

The Inland Port was like a dock before, where apart from the family that owned it, there must be someone who had the final say. That is to say, there was definitely a local boss in the Inland Port. Su Nantian must find out who this local boss was, otherwise he would definitely be targeted once he arrived. Plus, during the previous handover, he had come up with such an idea, so those people locked in the containers would probably not like the Nan Gong family's people.

Therefore, if he went to the Inland Port representing the Nan Gong family, these people would definitely come after him. They wouldn't let it go easily.

This way was different from Wu Chuan's intimidation towards Nan Gong Yu Yan. Wu Chuan had only caused minor inconvenience for her, but if Su Nantian went there, these people would definitely attack him directly.

After all, these people had been operating in the Inland Port for years and had formed their own势力. Giving him a cold shoulder would be good, but if they gathered a group to beat him up, that was also possible.

After all, the affairs in the Inland Port were never decided by the Wu family but by these local bosses.

Chapter 561: Call

Su Nantian knew he must obtain information about the power distribution in the Inland Port. However, this time he did not escape from Song Lichen; he had contacted him too many times, which made him feel a bit embarrassed.

But his secret organization was still not fully formed. It had no connection with the affairs in Kyoto. Therefore, Su Nantian could not rely on his secret organization. However, for Su Nantian, he had another option: the Sea King Gang.

Because the Sea King Gang was also operating in the underworld, so their nature was similar to those dock workers. However, these Inland Port dock workers had regular jobs, but they could also form a gang. Therefore, there was some similarity in nature with the Sea King Gang.

However, those who operated in the underworld were always well-informed about each other's news. If he asked the Sea King Gang to investigate the Inland Port, they would probably obtain detailed information.

Moreover, this small request would not exhaust all the favors he had previously received. So why not do it?

Therefore, Su Nantian called He Zun's phone. Actually, Su Nantian did not want to trouble He Zun, who was of such high status, to help him with this matter. However, he had no choice because when he left, he only kept the numbers of Yuan Da Ying and He Zun.

Therefore, Su Nantian could not call Yuan Da Ying to have the Sea King Gang's leader help him with this matter. After thinking it over, he decided to let He Zun handle it instead. Even if he did call Yuan Da Ying, Yuan Da Ying would only send He Zun to help him.

"Hello, who is this?" After the phone was answered, a cold voice came from the other end.

Su Nantian smiled and said, "You really have a short memory. It's been only a few days since you left the Sea King Gang, and you've already forgotten?"

He Zun was not a pushover. Upon hearing this tone and voice, he immediately realized that the person might be Su Nantian.

"Are you Nan Tian?" He Zun asked, still uncertain.

"It's great that you remember my name," Su Nantian smiled.

"Since you called me, have you already decided what we Sea King Gang should do for you? If you've made up your mind, just say it. We'll definitely do what we can. This is also to repay a favor."

After He Zun received the call, he felt relieved because he had previously refused Yuan Da Ying's request for Su Nantian. He thought that Su Nantian would ask for too much.

The longer the time dragged on, the more he was worried that this person would ask for more in the future.

But He Zun had not expected that it was only a few days since Su Nantian called him.

"I don't want to use my previous request, but I think this matter can only be helped by the Sea King Gang. For you, it's just a small effort. I don't need to cancel our previous agreement."

Su Nantian said this boldly, almost making He Zun dizzy.

However, He Zun had forgotten that at the moment he was with Yuan Da Ying. Yuan Da Ying had been looking at his computer and didn't have time to care about what He Zun was saying. But when he heard He Zun's reaction, he became curious and looked over.

Yuan Da Ying had not seen He Zun react like this for a long time. He was curious and said, "What's going on? Who is it that made you so angry? Who are you talking to?"

After He Zun heard Yuan Da Ying's question, he thought it was bad and immediately covered the phone receiver, saying, "Master, there's nothing wrong. You go ahead with your work. I'll go out to make a call."

After saying this, He Zun took the phone and wanted to leave the room. However, he had not expected Yuan Da Ying to rush over and snatch the phone from his hand, saying, "Who are you? You made He Zun so angry. I think your level is not low."

Su Nantian heard this voice from the other end and said, "Are you Yuan Da Ying from the Sea King Gang?"

"Yes, it's me. Who are you?" Yuan Da Ying was not as sharp as He Zun and did not recognize Su Nantian.

"I'm Nan Tian," Su Nantian continued to answer.

"Oh, Nan Tian. What are you doing now? Have you been praised after returning to the Nan Gong family? And what's the matter with your call to He Zun? I can also tell you. Or have you decided on the previous request?"

"Thank you, Master. However, after I returned to the Nan Gong family, everything remained the same. In fact, I was even punished because I was originally a criminal and had to make up for my mistakes. This time, I called you because I hadn't decided what request to make yet. However, I want the Sea King Gang to help me with a small favor. Do you think it's possible?"

Su Nantian hadn't expected Yuan Da Ying to answer the phone himself. However, it was better this way. Su Nantian had thought that if he asked Yuan Da Ying, it would be like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. But now that Yuan Da Ying had taken the call himself, it was unrelated.

"Ah? Tell me. I'll listen first. If it's really a small favor, we can help. It doesn't matter."

Yuan Da Ying said this very generously.

However, He Zun who was standing nearby immediately disliked it and said, "Master, don't be deceived. This person is just trying to avoid using his previous request and wants us Sea King Gang to help him. There's no such thing as a free lunch in the world, right?"

He Zun found that whenever he met Su Nantian again, they often had disagreements. And the result was usually that He Zun lost.

"Although this kid did help him before, if it's really a small effort, helping once is no problem. As for that request he wants to keep, we can leave it as it is. Our Sea King Gang won't say no, right? And this was my own words, like water poured out. Do you want me to retract and lie?"

Yuan Da Ying said while frowning.

"I didn't mean that. I just think this kid is clearly trying to get us Sea King Gang to help him without cost. Why should we fall for it? If he really wants us to help, then tell him to use up his previous request. We are certainly willing to help. After eliminating it, we can be debt-free and have no more obligations." He Zun tried to persuade.

Chapter 562: Equal Strength

Although Yuan Da Ying and He Zun had both tried to lower their voices while discussing this matter, Su Nantian on the other end of the phone still heard their arguments.

However, after hearing this argument, Su Nantian basically confirmed that he had asked Yuan Da Ying to investigate the matter about the Inland Port, and it was basically done.

Because of the previous experience, Su Nantian had some understanding of Yuan Da Ying's personality. In this issue, since Yuan Da Ying had already agreed with him, even if He Zun kept trying to persuade him, Yuan Da Ying would definitely not go back on his word.

Therefore, no matter what He Zun said, it wouldn't change Yuan Da Ying's decision.

"Enough. There's no need to discuss this further. I've already agreed with him. If I go back on my word now, it would lower the Sea King Gang's prestige. What if I have to face people in the future? Would our Sea King Gang not be mocked by others on the street? It's just a small matter, helping him investigate the people in the Inland Port. Just help him a little. Now you go and do it."

As expected, just as Su Nantian had anticipated, Yuan Da Ying directly ordered He Zun to handle this matter.

He Zun was also completely powerless. Since Yuan Da Ying had said it, he could only go and do it.

Because He Zun understood Yuan Da Ying's stubbornness in such matters. Especially since he had already agreed with Su Nantian without reason on the phone, the more this was, the more he would not retract his promise.

In fact, it was also a weakness of Yuan Da Ying. He Zun had known this for a long time, but no matter how he persuaded him, Yuan Da Ying never changed once.

He Zun could only shake his head helplessly and said, "Okay, I know. I'll go now."

After saying this, Yuan Da Ying left the room and ordered his subordinates to investigate the matter about the Inland Port immediately.

"I've already sent He Zun to investigate. Once he gets the information, he should contact you." Yuan Da Ying said to Su Nantian on the other end of the phone.

Su Nantian smiled and replied, "Thank you, Master Yuan. I didn't expect you to really help me. This makes me very touched."

"Hahahaha, it's because I like you kid. If you weren't a member of the Nan Gong family, I would definitely have kept you in the Sea King Gang. Unfortunately, you already have a supporting force now, so I can't ask for you. Let's say this: if you ever don't want to work in the Nan Gong family anymore, just come to our Sea King Gang. I'll definitely give you the best treatment."

Su Nantian hadn't expected Yuan Da Ying to try to recruit him. He could only smile and say, "I will! If I ever don't want to work in the Nan Gong family anymore, I'll definitely come find you."

After saying this, Su Nantian and Yuan Da Ying said goodbye to each other and hung up the phone. Now, what Su Nantian needed to do was wait, waiting for He Zun to send the information back to him.

Su Nantian knew that the Sea King Gang would not be too slow in investigating these materials, but it wouldn't be particularly fast either. He Zun would definitely delay the information he needed because of his reluctance, so Su Nantian didn't rush. After all, he was going to the Inland Port tomorrow.

So around midnight, Su Nantian received the information He Zun had investigated. However, for Su Nantian, this was also expected. He didn't care how late the information came and immediately opened it to check.

Although He Zun did not want to give him this information, the one he sent was quite detailed. After all, it was Yuan Da Ying's order, and he had to give Yuan Da Ying some face. He couldn't just send something random to fool Su Nantian.

Su Nantian looked at the information and immediately understood the distribution of power in the Inland Port. There were three dock bosses in the Inland Port. Each had a group of underlings, and they each did their own things without interfering with each other. However, if there was a conflict of interests, the three would bring their subordinates to negotiate.

There had even been major fights before, but they were all suppressed by the Wu family. Therefore, it hadn't escalated too much. However, if these three people really fought each other, the intensity could be comparable to a small gang.

These three bosses were named Wang Bo, Zhang Yuan, and Li Zhe.

Moreover, the power of these three was quite balanced, like a tripartite division. Generally, in the Inland Port, it was relatively balanced, so this trend had not been broken for so long. I also know that controlling them in this way is the most convenient, so we don't need to worry about their growth. As long as these three people are there, they can check each other, and it's not necessary for the Wu family to worry.

However, now that the Nan Gong family had taken over the Inland Port for a year, when he was sent there, he would definitely be excluded by these people. Therefore, these three might unite to attack him.

Not necessarily uniting, but their attitude would be consistent. After all, Su Nantian was an outsider. These three had been having conflicts occasionally in recent years but were on the same line of interest. If they really needed to split into factions, these three would definitely be on one side.

Therefore, if Su Nantian really arrived at the Inland Port and was excluded by others or had things done to him, he must first divide these three people and win over one of the forces for himself. Only then could he ensure his position in the Inland Port.

Because if the Nan Gong family's people took a disadvantageous position, they would not have an easy time for this year. Just based on this, Su Nantian had to prepare in advance.

Moreover, Su Nantian knew that Nan Gong Lin sent him there for two reasons. One was to help the Nan Gong family gain a good reputation in the Inland Port, because his martial arts were good. If there was any conflict, he could deal with it.

The second reason was also to send him there to temper his sharpness. He was currently suspecting his identity, so sending him to the Inland Port would definitely have someone monitoring him.

Therefore, the matter of going to the Inland Port was a small crisis for Su Nantian. At least, he could not easily pass through as before. Moreover, gaining the trust of the Nan Gong family was the only condition for him to continue relying on the Nan Gong family to get closer to the Wu family. His goal of rescuing Wu You'er and Wu Tao's couple could only be achieved this way.

Therefore, whether from the internal side of the Nan Gong family or from the Inland Port dockside, Su Nantian was now caught between two fronts.

However, such a small hardship would not make Su Nantian give up.

Chapter 563: Nan Gong Fei

After understanding the situation in the Inland Port, Su Nantian felt he had a certain grasp of it. However, what to do specifically would depend on his observations after arriving at the Inland Port.

After all, Su Nantian was currently considering the worst-case scenario. If he went to the Inland Port and these people were all friendly towards him, then there would be nothing to worry about.

The next morning, as Su Nantian was preparing to drive to the Inland Port for his appointment, he reached the door and saw someone waiting outside. Before Su Nantian could ask who this person was, Nan Gong Ping's voice came from behind: "Nantian, I'm here to see you off."

But when Nan Gong Ping came out, he also saw the person standing outside and said in surprise: "Uncle, why did you come over? What do you need from me?"

Su Nantian later found out that the person standing outside was actually Nan Gong Ping's uncle.

So Su Nantian immediately said to Nan Gong Ping, "Master, the two of you talk first. I'll go now."

"Little Brother, I'm not here to see you. I'm here to see your little bodyguard Nantian." Unexpectedly, Nan Gong Fei said this.

This made Nan Gong Ping very surprised and asked: "What do you need from Nantian? If I'm not mistaken, the two of you have never met before."

Nan Gong Ping knew that his uncle Nan Gong Fei had always been idle and often got into trouble. He thought that Nan Gong Fei might have heard about Nantian's fighting ability and wanted to take him out to deal with some trivial matters.

Thinking about this, Nan Gong Ping looked very helpless and said: "Uncle, if you want to take my bodyguard out to help you deal with these trivial matters, just let him do the water fetching. I advise you to leave quickly. I won't let Nantian go with you for this kind of thing. You should also think about it. For so many years, being idle, shouldn't you now find something to do? Don't just wander around outside."

As Nan Gong Ping spoke, he scolded him. Although he was Nan Gong Fei's cousin, since Nan Gong Lin was the family head, he was undoubtedly the main branch. Moreover, Nan Gong Ping might be the next family head, so for people like Nan Gong Fei, he was obedient. Especially since Nan Gong Fei himself was idle, so everyone looked down on him. It was normal for Nan Gong Ping to scold him a little.

Nan Gong Fei heard Nan Gong Ping's words and waved his hand, looking very委屈. He said: "Cousin, don't scold me anymore. I came here to do something serious."

"What's the seriousness? What serious matters do you have with my bodyguard? The two of you don't even know each other." Nan Gong Ping was still very confused and continued to say this.

"Isn't our family obtained the right to profit from the Inland Port for a year from the Wu family? Is your bodyguard being sent there by Uncle? Also, I was sent there. So now we are colleagues. And in terms of rank, I am slightly higher than him. Therefore, I now need to take him with me to the Inland Port. We should start working."

After saying this, Nan Gong Fei looked very proud, as if he was very proud of having such a job. After all, everyone thought he was idle and did nothing but this sudden job made him feel it was worth showing off.

"You... What did you say? You said your father sent you to the Inland Port?" Nan Gong Ping also looked surprised and turned around to look at Su Nantian. Su Nantian shook his head, he had no idea about this.

If Su Nantian had known anything, he wouldn't have not known who the person was when he came out. Before this, Su Nantian had never met Nan Gong Fei and didn't know he was a member of the Nan Gong family, nor did he know this person was Nan Gong Ping's uncle.

Moreover, the most important point was that Su Nantian had no idea Nan Gong Lin had also sent someone with him. Of course, when he thought about this matter yesterday, he had thought that Nan Gong Lin would definitely send someone to monitor him. But he hadn't expected it to be such a person.

Originally, Su Nantian had thought that Nan Gong Ping would send someone more clever to go with him. But in the end, it was still a relative connection that sent his idle nephew.

If this Nan Gong Fei really did as Nan Gong Ping said, being idle and doing nothing but being a纨绔子弟, then Su Nantian could easily deal with him without causing any trouble.

"You believe me, it's true. If my uncle hadn't told me, would I know anything about the Inland Port?" Nan Gong Fei knew that Nan Gong Ping's expression was disbelief, so he quickly explained.

After thinking about it, Nan Gong Ping felt that Nan Gong Fei's words did make sense. The Inland Port matter was now a small secret for the Wu family, not everyone knew about it.

"Okay, I don't doubt you. If that's the case, then both of you go together." After saying this, Nan Gong Ping walked over to Su Nantian.

Nan Gong Ping approached Su Nantian's ear and patted his shoulder, saying: "My uncle is idle. He usually does things like drinking and fighting or flirting with other girls. So this time in the Inland Port, he might cause trouble for you. Watch him carefully and be careful. Don't let him mess up your things. Make sure to record it if he makes a mistake, so that my father won't blame you."

Su Nantian nodded and said to Nan Gong Ping: "Thank you, Master. You don't need to worry about me. I will be careful."

"You're saying bad things about me again? I've already changed my ways. Since this time, my uncle gave me a chance to have a job, I will definitely do it well. You can rest assured."

It seemed Nan Gong Fei had already predicted that Nan Gong Ping would say bad things about him, so he said to Nan Gong Ping.

"Don't say it's bad. I'm just giving a good warning. After all, based on your usual personality, you might cause trouble. I'll tell you, this time the Inland Port matter is very important. If he makes a mistake, I think you'll never be able to recover."

Nan Gong Ping said this was to scare him. After all, he was a member of the Nan Gong family. How could he let someone be ruined for one mistake? Unless it was a mistake that was unforgivable.

"I know, I know. Don't scare me anymore. I will definitely do it well this time. Alright, let's go." Nan Gong Fei said this and directly got into Su Nantian's car.

Chapter 564: Intentional Obstruction

Thus, Su Nantian acted as Nan Gong Fei's driver and took him to the Inland Port.

This time, when Su Nantian arrived at the Inland Port, he found that the Inland Port had started to operate in an orderly manner. It was not like when they came before, where there were no people at all in the Inland Port.

Su Nantian and Nan Gong Fei walked towards the office. Since they had come here, naturally, they needed to greet the people there.

When Su Nantian and Nan Gong Fei entered the office, they found that the door of the office was also open. Three people were sitting inside drinking tea, looking very relaxed and at ease.

However, Su Nantian could feel that these three people were not ordinary people. They had a calm and composed aura. If Su Nantian's guess was correct, these three people were probably Wang Bo, Zhang Yuan, and Li Zhe.

"Good day, we are from the Nan Gong family. Today, we came to take over the affairs here," Nan Gong Fei said directly and went forward. After all, his rank in the Inland Port was higher than Su Nantian's, so this matter had to be handled by him.

Su Nantian originally thought these three local bosses might directly trouble them, but instead, when the three people turned around and saw them, they smiled and pointed to an office inside. "We've heard about it. The office inside is left for the two of you. Actually, there's nothing much to do. The workers are still doing their previous jobs. You two can just sit in the office."

Seeing them so amiable, Su Nantian was a bit surprised. However, if this was the case, it would be best; at least there would be no conflict.

Thus, Su Nantian and Nan Gong Fei smiled and nodded. Then the two of them walked into the office.

The office had an inner and outer room. Su Nantian naturally sat in the outer room, while Nan Gong Fei was in the inner office.

When Nan Gong Fei pushed open the door and walked into the inner office, he found that there was a mountain of files on the desk.

Nan Gong Fei immediately rushed out and said to Su Nantian, "Nantian, come in and look. This..."

Su Nantian was confused and walked in. After seeing the files piled on the desk, he was also shocked. However, he first calmed himself down and walked over to look at the file folders.

"Stay calm. It might be the previous对接 data." But after Su Nantian looked through all these files, he realized that this was not what he thought it was. It was not the对接 data but the incomplete reports left by the Wu family.

"Why didn't the Wu family finish this stuff? Is it for you to do?" Su Nantian said in confusion and handed one of the documents to Nan Gong Fei.

Although Nan Gong Fei was usually idle, he had been sent abroad by his father for a few months. He understood some basics of this area.

Therefore, when Nan Gong Fei opened the file folder and saw its contents, he was shocked.
