Su Nantian extended his hand and flicked it, sending the Nascent Soul Purple Flame cascading onto the steel stacks!

Ren Zhengyang was genuinely stunned. He had never imagined that this tiny flame, which he had previously looked down upon, would devour the entire warehouse's steel within a few breaths!

Five large warehouses contained 500 tons of steel, and this was only the fifteenth.

As the Nascent Soul Purple Flame devoured the metal, hundreds of tons vanished into thin air. At the site lay a small black iron block no larger than a palm, irregular in shape and slightly warm to the touch.

This was the black iron refined by Su Nantian using the Nascent Soul Purple Flame. Just a small piece, it weighed about one or two catties in his hand.

Yet Su Nantian's brows furrowed, unimpressed with its quality.

But what could he do? Even if dissatisfied, this was currently the most suitable material available on Earth. At least it was quite good.

Su Nantian had a premonition that the matter with the Hezhou Wu Family was far from over. He needed to prepare his artifact swiftly, anticipating a fierce battle.

Since the decision was made, he could only use this black iron as a makeshift solution. He would upgrade his artifact later when obtaining better materials.

Under Ren Zhengyang's guidance, they toured four other warehouses. Previously, Ren Zhengyang had been a scoundrel who regarded money as filth.

Moreover, now that he had witnessed Su Nantian's divine techniques, his desire to seek immortality was intense. He no longer cared for worldly matters, feeling the transaction was an absolute bargain.

In the end, 500 tons of steel fused into several palm-sized iron blocks. This costly black iron was merely the initial form of an artifact, requiring additional materials.

Gold, a precious item since ancient times, had always maintained stable and high value. Now Su Nantian needed vast quantities of it.

Fortunately, although substantial, the amount was less than that of black iron.

The most prudent method would have been for Su Nantian to locate a gold ore deposit and extract the gold or required materials.

If time were on his side, he would have chosen this method. However, it was now too late.

But with money, even the devil would be moved. On Earth, nothing was impossible with sufficient funds.

Su Nantian took over the entire city's gold shops and exchanged considerable amounts of gold bars, barely managing to acquire enough.

Returning to Fengyue Residential Area, Su Nantian began his seclusion to refine the artifact.

Though he had previously crafted many objects, they were merely simple ornaments. Due to the magic arrays embedded within them, they possessed peculiar functions and were dubbed "artifacts."

In truth, these items barely qualified as magic tools, the most inferior category.

Today he was forging his first artifact since returning to Earth. Though claiming no excitement, he felt a slight nervousness within.

Purple flames surged upward like a high-temperature furnace. The materials gradually melted, transforming into thick black liquid under Su Nantian's spiritual awareness. One by one, the shapes emerged.

It was a sword, slightly different from the Han Liu Sword accompanying Su Yu.

The blade was short and wide, appearing to devour everything in its dark black hue.

Neither the hilt nor the guard held any significance for Su Nantian, so he omitted them.

The primary purpose of a flying sword was long-range combat; few would foolishly clash with an opponent using the hilt.

As Su Nantian continued shaping, a short sword materialized before him. The blade was straight, about 30 centimeters long, jet-black with no patterns.

Though the black iron's quality was low and impure, it was still quite good at this stage.

After refining the sword's core, Su Nantian took a large amount of gold and subjected it to the same process, casting all into the Nascent Soul Purple Flame.

Gradually, the fire diminished. A single drop of golden liquid remained on the ground.

Chapter 118: Forging the Sword (Part II)

This drop, formed after countless golden lotus processes, was the legendary essence gold.

It was the true quintessence of gold, faintly displaying a crimson-purple hue. "No gold is perfect," was irrelevant before Su Nantian.

Meanwhile, the freshly refined sword core floated over, hovering before him. The golden liquid formed threads that adhered to it, beginning to inscribe arrays.

Ferocious Array叠加Ferocious Array. Feather Array叠加Invisibility Array... Ren Zhengyang, watching from the side, dared not breathe, yet his heart was exhilarated.

"I haven't made a mistake; my choice was indeed correct! Having glimpsed this colorful world, how could I not pursue it? It would be a shame to live in vain!"

Su Nantian naturally had no idea of Ren Zhengyang's complex inner thoughts. He fully immersed himself in forging this flying sword.

As arrays were continuously etched, the black blade gradually turned golden. Eventually, it vanished entirely, transforming into a small golden sword.

This flying sword bore layer upon layer of arrays. Though these were merely basic arrays, they represented Su Nantian's current pinnacle.

Constrained by his cultivation and materials, he could not inscribe two advanced arrays. However, low-level arrays stacked sufficiently would yield formidable power, capable of rivaling high-level arrays.

Feeling the materials vanish, Su Nantian unleashed another burst of Nascent Soul Purple Flame, fully incinerating the flying sword.

After a short while, Ren Zhengyang heard a resonant sword cry! Upon closer inspection, the purple fire had vanished. Su Nantian sat motionless before him.

Yet around him, a golden light flitted about. Clearly, this was the flying sword he had just forged!

After flickering briefly, the golden light directly lunged toward Su Nantian's forehead. In Ren Zhengyang's exclamation, it transformed into a sword imprint, etched onto his brow!

As the flying sword entered his body, Su Nantian felt a sharp blade's energy evolving within his true essence. It led the other essences, breaking through the cultivation level seven barrier with unstoppable force!

The once impregnable bottleneck crumbled before the sharp blade's energy, offering no resistance.

At Su Nantian's breakthrough to cultivation level seven, the Hezhou Wu Family also stirred.

Still that same hall. Still that same youth seated on the main seat. Yet, for some reason, this youth now bore a few strands of white hair. His previously tight face had developed several aged wrinkles.

"Cough, cough. You all know the situation. Share your thoughts!"

Previously, his voice had switched between childish and aged tones. Now, the youth's voice sounded remarkably normal. Yet to those in the hall, it was akin to demonic music.

The youth's voice and aged tone had gradually merged. If one didn't see his face, only heard his voice, they might assume he was a 30-year-old man!

The Hezhou Wu Family's resources could not forge anything like a life-mark.

Such magic tools were common in the cultivation world, but nonexistent on Earth.

Yet, not everything required such methods. Technology could also solve problems! Each Wu Family elder wore a wristband that monitored heartbeats in real-time, transmitting data to computers at the Wu Family headquarters.

Thus, compared to the painstakingly crafted life-mark, this high-tech wristband could monitor life and death while also providing real-time positioning!

The Wu Family hall immediately became tense, with no one speaking. The death of three elders was no small matter. Yet compared to this, the head's transformation worried them more!

They clearly felt that the current Wu Family head was no longer the same. Each time they saw him, a deep sense of shock, terror, and fear arose within them.

That overwhelming aura, like an abyssal depth, towered over everyone! It pressed upon them so heavily they struggled to breathe.

Though previously this youth was hailed as a rare genius of the Wu Family, his rapid progress had reached cultivation level seven, surpassing many elders.

Yet at least they could sense its reality and depth. Now, this youth left them feeling impenetrable and fearful!

Possession? Reincarnation? Parasitism?

What was the relationship between this youth and his grandfather? Each person in the hall had their own thoughts, yet no one dared to inquire or investigate.

Originally, the Wu Family had nine elders. Though their cultivation might not be high, they were a force in China.

Now, only three remained seated in the hall. Besides those three who died in Fengcheng, what happened to the remaining three was left unsaid.

Seeing everyone remain silent, Wu Family's eldest son showed no anger. Instead, he spoke gently: "Since you can't offer good ideas, listen to me!"

Three elders had died. Only the three of you maintain the Wu Family's current operations.

But against a strong enemy, we cannot show weakness. Elder Five, go and fetch my letter of invitation to meet him!"

I want to see what abilities this so-called Fengcheng Lin Family, this so-called twin, truly possesses!"

Elder Five nodded without speaking. He approached respectfully to take a letter of invitation and then retreated.

Though he was at cultivation level six, his back was already drenched in sweat within a short time.

After exiting the hall, a gust of cold wind hit him. He suddenly felt chilly.

"Ah, the Wu Family is really getting harder to survive these days. I need to find a backdoor for myself. I wonder what's happened with Qingyang Sword Sect. Half a month ago, I sent the message, but it still hasn't responded yet!"

While pondering these thoughts, Elder Five's movements were swift. He transformed into a blur and headed toward Fengcheng by train!

Chapter 119: Instructions

It was truly awkward. A true cultivator, traveling by train—his prestige instantly plummeted countless levels.

But what could he do? Cultivators were still people. To travel, they naturally needed transportation.

Fengcheng was a small town. Not only did it lack planes, but even high-speed rail was absent.

Clang, clang, Elder Five had no seat. He stood for four hours on a ticket, finally arriving at Fengcheng Station.

When he disembarked, there was no trace of the cultivator's ethereal aura. He looked like a working-class man returning home for the New Year.

Su Nantian sat on the sofa in front of a coffee table. Opposite him was Elder Five from the Wu Family.

Holding the exquisite invitation, Su Nantian smiled slightly as he asked him: "You mean your family thinks this is a misunderstanding and wants to invite me for dinner, chatting it over?"

"Yes, yes. That's right!"

Under Su Nantian's gaze, Elder Five felt two sharp sword energies piercing his heart. He dared not even resist!

He also secretly speculated about this person's background.

Why were the young people so terrifying now? Had he truly grown old?

There was already a little monster in the family. Now another had arrived!

The invitation was ordinary, with no special features. After thinking it over, Su Nantian found nothing amiss. He replied to Elder Five: "Tell your family head I'll be there in three days."

After sending off Elder Five, Su Nantian sat on the sofa, deep in thought.

"South Sky Brother, who was it? What did they need?"

The three girls, who had been in their rooms all along, now emerged. They asked Su Nantian as he sat on the sofa.

After the previous incident, Yao Lina had been living here. Although Lin Suyun was still unhappy, she could do nothing.

Now Su Nantian and Yao Lina's relationship was impossible to sever. As for Gao Jingjing, even Lin Suyun couldn't harm her; there was no choice but to accept.

Yet the three girls had secretly formed an alliance, cooperating to guard against Su Nantian seeking other women!

Especially the police station's Zhang, whose gaze made Lin Suyun always vigilant.

"Ah, nothing. A friend from the cultivation world invited me to dinner in two days."

Upon hearing this, Lin Suyun nodded and didn't press further. She knew that if Su Nantian wanted her to know about cultivation matters, he would tell her. If he didn't, it meant she couldn't know. After all, knowing wouldn't help.

But after thinking, she still had something to say to Su Nantian.

"South Sky Brother, you really should get an agent. Now you're quite a star. It's too low-level. Calls to invite you have even reached Lin Group."

Hearing this, Su Nantian felt a bit embarrassed. This was indeed his problem.

Regarding his star identity, he always forgot it. He viewed it more as a means to collect faith rather than a career.

But thinking about it, he was indeed careless. Think of how in the cultivation world, an elder at Nascent Soul level would tirelessly run around for a small sect with only tens of thousands of people, collecting faith. That was pitiful!

Now back on Earth, where entertainment is developed, collecting faith was simple. If he still wasn't careful, it would be disrespectful to the audience.

But with so much on his plate, he needed time for meals and sleep. Where was there time to be a star?

After thinking it over, Su Nantian suddenly had an idea. He led Lin Suyun and the others to the altar, gently knocking on it.

The family's sudden appearance of a deity worshiped was unexpected. They didn't know what this deity was, but they didn't think much of it and occasionally offered incense.

Today, seeing Su Nantian knock on the altar, they were puzzled about what he was up to.

"What's wrong? It's early in the morning!"

Suddenly, a familiar voice echoed. A beam of divine light descended from the deity.

A Su Nantian in a blue robe, wearing a long sword, appeared before them.

"This... South Sky Brother... this is..."

Lin Suyun, Gao Jingjing, and Yao Lina were all stunned, unsure what this new entity was.

"Ah! Sorry for the disturbance!"

Su Yu's sword seemed to have just woken up. He glanced at the situation outside and turned to leave.

But Gao Jingjing grabbed his sleeve.

"South Sky Brother, wait!"

...

The four of them sat on the sofa, gazing at each other. Su Nantian and Su Yu sat on one side; the three girls sat on the other, scrutinizing.

"Um... you know... cultivation always has its special places! For example, we two are actually one person!"

Feeling uneasy under the three girls' gaze, Su Nantian spoke while merging with Su Yu.

Then he separated and continued: "But we two are also different.

To put it simply, he's more like the ideal of fans—a noble gentleman in a corrupt world. I'm the South Sky Brother you know."

Su Nantian briefly introduced his relationship with Su Yu. Upon looking up, he found the three girls glowing with excitement!

"South Sky Brother, do you mean that both of you are actually one person?"

Su Nantian nodded to Gao Jingjing's question.

"So, does that mean both of us can be your boyfriend?"

This was Lin Suyun's question. Su Nantian felt something was off.

"So we can choose this, right?"

When saying this, Yao Lina had already wrapped her arms around Su Yu's. This made Su Nantian's eyelids twitch, and Su Yu looked somewhat helpless.

With Yao Lina's start, Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing rushed forward. Though they might not truly dislike Su Nantian, having a change of taste seemed quite good!

"Hmph! (╯^╰)!"

Su Nantian let out a cold snort. Su Yu immediately transformed into a beam of light, merging with him. The girls all missed their chance!

"South Sky Brother, you really are canny! You said both of us were one person, right?"

Lin Suyun had to condemn Su Nantian's trickery.

"You're such a person, even eating your own jealousy?" Gao Jingjing helped.

"Yes, yes!" That was Gao Jingjing.

Chapter 120: Qingyang's Envoy

The news Lin Suyun brought hadn't finished. A film crew had invited Su Nantian to participate in a variety show. Initially, he didn't care about these things and took it lightly.

But after truly benefiting from faith, he felt reluctant to give it up.

If this time's effect was good, maybe faith would surge again and harvest a large wave.

This wasn't just a minor improvement in power!

Finally, Su Nantian decided to attend the Wu Family's invitation with the letter. Meanwhile, Su Yu would go to the variety show. They wouldn't interfere with each other.

Time flew by, and without books, it was short. Three days passed in the blink of an eye.

Su Nantian tidied up and headed to Hezhou Wu Family, attending their invitation. Naturally, he didn't believe in the so-called misunderstanding. He knew what was truly going on.

Cultivation required vast resources. These were either owned or unowned, needing to be fought for.

In the cultivation world, such matters were common. Every year, countless people died due to resource competition.

His conflict with the Grand Elder could also be categorized as such. As for Hezhou Wu Family, although Su Nantian didn't know their intentions, it wasn't a problem to check out!

With his Flying Sword, Fu Yun, he truly didn't care about the Wu Family.

Fu Yun was the flying sword Su Nantian had forged a few days ago, named after "Supporting Clouds from the Nine Heavens."

Though this sword had no high-level arrays, it had ninety-nine layers of the Sharp Array, granting it an unbreakable sharpness. It also had forty-nine layers of the Feather Array, providing speed that vanished instantly and spanned千里.

Plus the Invisibility Array to eliminate air resistance and remove the sound of breaking through the air, this sword was terrifying.

Not only others, but even Su Nantian himself felt wary. If this sword were used to ambush him by someone else, he wouldn't be sure if he could dodge!

The only regret was that without high-level arrays, Fu Yun couldn't change size or carry people to fly. As for advanced operations like turning the sword into threads, it couldn't support them.

But there was no need to rush. Su Nantian's cultivation was only at the Seventh Level of Cultivation. Even if given a high-level flying sword, his cultivation couldn't support such advanced operations.

When he reached the level of innate ability to fly with a sword, maybe he would obtain new materials to upgrade Fu Yun!

Thinking of this, Fu Yun appeared in Su Nantian's hand, emitting a faint sword cry.

The golden essence arrays carved on the blade gradually disappeared within its body. Its inner black nature was revealed, presenting a deep and profound darkness that seemed to absorb all light.

Yet, as it moved, golden glimmers flowed across its surface.

With a flip of his hand, Fu Yun vanished. Su Nantian drove his Rolls-Royce Phantom directly to Hezhou. He didn't want to take the train, as Elder Five's previous embarrassment still lingered in his mind.

Meanwhile, Hezhou Wu Family also received a guest of high status!

Sun Peng, an inner sect elder's disciple from Qingyang Sword Sect, had come to the Wu Family to investigate what happened.

Half a month ago, the Wu Family's message had already reached Qingyang Sword Sect. It wasn't until today that Qingyang Sword Sect sent someone to investigate. This efficiency was indeed slow.

Although Qingyang Sword Sect had always been secluded and followed ancient customs, they were still people who needed to live.

In today's society, to live required sufficient money. To cultivate required vast resources.

The Wu Family played the role of collecting resources for Qingyang Sword Sect. As a subordinate family, they provided substantial funds and cultivation resources annually.

What they received was Qingyang Sword Sect's protection and some assistance with techniques.

Most cultivation世家 in the secular world were like this, each backed by a sect.

Sun Peng's arrival wasn't grand. He silently met with several elders he had contacted, including the Fifth Elder who had previously sent Su Nantian a letter.

In a secluded courtyard of the Wu Family, Sun Peng sat at the head position. Below him were several elders.

"From what you said, this family's issue was caused by a competition between the old patriarch and his嫡 grandson.

This is an internal matter of your family, and as a stranger, I can't interfere. The guarantee Qingyang Sword Sect can offer is that as long as Qingyang Sword Sect exists, the Wu Family will also exist. We won't let your lineage be cut off!"

Hearing Sun Peng's words, the elders exchanged glances. A sense of sorrow arose within them.

Although they had lived for decades and experienced countless human affairs, they still clung to the last hope of seeking help from Qingyang Sword Sect.

But now this last hope had been shattered. The remaining was to tremble under the terrifying head of the family, hoping for more days.

Sun Peng found it amusing that they had come to him. It was quite a joke.

For Qingyang Sword Sect, the Wu Family was merely a dog. And this dog seemed old and no longer useful.

As long as Qingyang Sword Sect opened its mouth, countless people would be willing to become dogs. Why care about a Wu Family?

For them, it made no difference who led the Wu Family. As long as the required resources were paid monthly without fail, Qingyang Sword Sect didn't care about the corruption within.

Even if one side could offer more resources and thus gain Qingyang Sword Sect's support, it was possible.

But compared to the Wu Family's matter, Sun Peng was more interested in this so-called Fengcheng Lin Family.

A person could kill three elders at the Sixth Level of Cultivation. Even Sun Peng couldn't do it now. It intrigued him somewhat.

In this land of China, countless myths and legends had emerged since ancient times. Perhaps in some corners, there were remnants of inheritance.

Maybe this kid had obtained one or two of them. Otherwise, Sun Peng knew all the sects' inheritances. He hadn't heard of any disciples from Fengcheng.

"Ha! The resources you gain aren't necessarily yours. Only by guarding them can they belong to you!"

Su Nantian didn't know that before he arrived in Hezhou, someone had already set their sights on him!

Chapter 121: A Display of Authority

Su Nantian arrived at Hezhou Wu Family according to the address on the invitation.

This place wasn't in the city center but a old mansion in the suburbs. Surrounded by mountains and water, it was picturesque. Even Su Nantian could sense a tiny spiritual vein hidden beneath the ground.

Though this spiritual vein was so small it was almost imperceptible, barely providing any spiritual energy support, it could still make the place mountainous and water-rich.

Honestly, Su Nantian felt a bit greedy toward this small spiritual vein of the Wu Family.

In the cultivation world, such spiritual veins were considered trash—no one would bother to pick them up. Whether nurturing or developing, they required vast resources and were difficult to recoup. It wasn't worth investing.

But this was Earth, where even the thin spiritual energy could find a small spiritual vein. It was quite surprising.

Even if this spiritual vein was so poor, it might still contain a few pieces of spiritual stones.

For this mission, Su Nantian was actually looking forward to it. Now he hoped the Wu Family would take a hard stance, forcing him to hand over the Death Crow.

This way, he'd have an excuse to act. Even if he slaughtered the entire Wu Family and seized the spiritual vein, the cultivation world wouldn't say much.

Su Nantian's Rolls-Royce Phantom was parked at the Wu Family's main gate. He leaned against the car, smoking a cigarette and exhaling smoke.

He had smoked before, but in the cultivation world for twenty thousand years, he had quit smoking for twenty thousand years. He recently picked it up again.

But with his current physical condition, smoking had no harm to health. It didn't matter.

The Wu Family wanted to give him a display of authority, but he wouldn't accept it. He stood there waiting. After all, the invitation was from them. Let's see who could endure longer!

Su Nantian didn't believe the Wu Family would let him block the gate all day without entry.

He even thought that perhaps the next moment someone would come to fetch him in.

Indeed, as he had predicted, at that time in the Wu Family's hall.

Sun Peng and the Wu Family's eldest son sat at the head position, while three elders sat below.

As for the other chairs in the hall, there were none.

These people gathered here to wait for Su Nantian to enter and give him a display of authority.

After a while, the servant reported that Su Nantian had parked his car at the main gate and was waiting there.

This result made Sun Peng's lips twitch, forcing himself not to break his composure.

For today's matter, he had come to watch a spectacle and observe this Su Nantian. He wanted to see if there was any high-level inheritance on him, or if he had his own opportunities!

Opportunities were Su Nantian's? Ha! In Sun Peng's mind, anything he saw and desired was his!

This thought coincided with Su Nantian's. If these two met, they could be friends besides being enemies. For example, now Su Nantian was thinking of plans to steal the Wu Family's underground ore vein.

In Sun Peng's view, cultivation was about competing with all things. The so-called face and prestige were no match for half a spiritual stone!

The Wu Family's display of authority was embarrassing. It wasn't necessary, it was a joke. If they didn't want to be enemies with Su Nantian, there was no need for this.

If they wanted to be enemies with Su Nantian, the best way was now to grovel and approach him!

Sun Peng said nothing. Let the Wu Family handle their own matters.

The Wu Family's head, a youth who looked like an adult, seeing Sun Peng showed no intention to intervene, signaled the steward: "You go and bring him in. Be polite!"

Though he said to be polite, the tone was somewhat sinister, with no real politeness.

The steward understood his master's intention. He bowed and nodded before going out to meet Su Nantian.

Leaning on the black car hood of his Rolls-Royce, Su Nantian's cigarette hadn't finished smoking when he saw an old man timidly coming out of the Wu Family gate.

Seeing Su Nantian looking at him, the old man bowed respectfully and said: "Mr. Su, I am the Wu Family's steward. Please follow me. The master has prepared a banquet and is waiting for your esteemed presence."

Su Nantian said nothing. He extinguished his cigarette, nodded, and followed the old man inside.

Yet for some reason, the Wu Family's steward took him not through the main gate but a side door.

The Wu Family's main gate had a traditional appearance. High beams, with the words "Hezhou Wu Family" on the plaque. Below the plaque was a red door, with golden caps.

Normally, Su Nantian, invited by the Hezhou Wu Family to attend a banquet, should have been welcomed through the main gate.

But now, this red main door was closed tightly. Only a side door at the corner was open.

"Steward Wu, since the Hezhou Wu Family invited me with an invitation to attend this banquet, is this how your family treats guests?"

Su Nantian's face was cold. He spoke slowly and clearly to the steward.

Whether in the cultivation world or on Earth, the older families always emphasized rules and etiquette.

Today's actions by Hezhou Wu Family clearly violated these customs.

Even if they won today and captured Su Nantian, such matters would spread and invite resistance from other families in the circle.

Moreover, with Su Nantian present, how could they possibly win?

Hearing Su Nantian's words, the steward stopped and turned to face him. His face still wore a smiling expression as he said: "Mr. Su, you don't understand. This Wu Family's main gate isn't something anyone can open.

Originally, the Wu Family was a top family in the cultivation world. Though now it has somewhat declined, its foundation still remains.

This door was a treasure left by the ancestors of the Wu Family. Only true strength can open it. Now, the Wu Family's descendants have no way to do so. Please understand."

The steward's words made Su Nantian snort, but he said nothing more. This was a cunning old fox. Though the situation remained the same, his words were flawlessly polite, making it hard for Su Nantian to find a reason to retaliate.

Chapter 122: A Precious Item

The steward still wore a smiling expression, standing in place without rushing. He waited for Su Nantian's actions, appearing to let him decide.

In reality, this old fox would never give Su Nantian any opening in words. More often than not, he bowed low and appeared respectful.

He truly had the demeanor of a noble family's servant.

Su Nantian snorted, but he clearly knew. The "no way" was just an excuse. It was merely to test his strength!

At this point, the so-called display of authority had some meaning. At least it showed real effort.

Su Nantian stood before the door, his spiritual awareness slightly probed its depth.

It was indeed good. This seemingly ordinary red door was actually a magic tool! Though the materials used weren't high-grade, not even matching his Fu Yun Sword, they were still generous.

On the surface, this door seemed wooden. In reality, it was forged from black iron. Even if this black iron was inferior to the one Su Nantian refined, it seemed to contain other elements.

But it was still generous. Inconceivable for a family that had endured for thousands of years, though its descendants weren't very capable. Just this one door allowed Su Nantian to sense the Wu Family's foundation.

Of course, after seeing this door, Su Nantian had no fear. He was more determined to steal the Wu Family!

He had previously done so for the ore vein, now with another reason. He planned to steal this door too.

Seeing the steward's attitude of "let him do as he pleased," Su Nantian made up his mind. However, he feigned hesitation and asked him:

"Steward Wu, this door is indeed the Wu Family's front. If I really have to act, and it gets damaged... perhaps..."

Hearing Su Nantian's words, the steward secretly laughed.

"This poor kid must have no real inheritance. Relying on a few tricks, he thinks himself invincible.

He doesn't even know what magic tools are. He wants to break it with brute force. It's really overconfident.

But his face was a simple and honest one, speaking softly: "Mr. Su, you're joking. Please feel free to act!"
