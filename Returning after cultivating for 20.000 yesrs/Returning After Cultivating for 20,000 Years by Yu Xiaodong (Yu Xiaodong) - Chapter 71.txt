Among these three categories of people, Su Nantian first ruled out his own men. They had all departed from Xinyue Group together; anyone with a scent of blood would not escape his notice. He could not have just now detected it. As for the journalists and hotel staff, he was still uncertain.

Yet one thing was certain: these people were all employees. Who would risk their life to work here, facing the danger of severe blood loss?

Recalling this, Su Nantian tightened his grip around Yue Xiaoshan, pressing her closer to him. He had no fear of ten thousand enemies but dreaded the unknown. If that man came with hostile intent toward Yue Xiaoshan, he would be ready to react swiftly.

Chapter 342: The Challenge

“Nantian, what's wrong?”

Feeling the immense force around her waist, Yue Xiaoshan sensed something amiss and whispered, “What's wrong?”

Su Nantian glanced around, lowering his voice: “I smelled the scent of blood. Be careful nearby; if anyone charges at you, hide in my arms. Understand?”

“Okay, I know.”

Having experienced so many dangers before, Yue Xiaoshan had learned how to handle such emergencies. Unlike the early days when she was helpless, this made Su Nantian deeply relieved.

“Hmph.”

Su Nantian held Yue Xiaoshan close, slowing his pace and narrowing his eyes to scan the crowd. Suddenly, he spotted a familiar face.

The man seemed to sense his gaze and quickly tried to cover half of his face with his hand. But Su Nantian’s eyes were sharp; he had never mistaken anyone he locked onto.

Su Nantian's gaze filled with surprise: “Is that Hu Ge’s subordinate?”

Yes, the man he had locked onto was indeed a trusted underling of Lanban Hu. He had some recollection of this man.

“Seems the strong scent of blood comes from him. Did he get injured, or did he just kill someone and got covered in blood?”

After identifying the target, Su Nantian's senses converged instantly to pinpoint the source of the blood scent—Bai Ling.

“It seems this kid must have been injured.”

If he had just killed someone, he would have tried to leave the scene. Otherwise, they might catch him off guard after discovering the body.

Thus, Su Nantian deduced he was injured and in serious condition. But why was he still mingling with the journalists? Had he unfinished business?

Yue Xiaoshan noticed Su Nantian suddenly stop, as if lost in thought. She prompted: “Nantian, what are you doing? Hurry up and go in.”

“Uh… just a moment. I have something to take care of. You go ahead, okay?”

Su Nantian wanted to talk to him directly, especially since he was injured. He needed to find out what the man was up to and whether he required assistance.

“Alright, Nana. Let’s go in.”

Su Nantian spoke with such gravity that Yue Xiaoshan didn’t question further, leading her secretary Han Nana into the venue.

Seeing her move forward while Su Nantian remained behind, the journalists instinctively rushed after Yue Xiaoshan. After all, she was the CEO of Xinyue Group. This banquet was a gathering of business elites. Though Su Nantian was wealthy, his status paled in comparison to hers. For the front page tomorrow, they knew exactly who to photograph.

“Good going.” Su Nantian muttered silently.

The man, however, did not follow the crowd but walked to the side, attempting to hide in the shadows of a Roman column.

Seizing the moment when everyone’s attention was on Yue Xiaoshan, Su Nantian sidestepped and leaped forward with two quick steps to approach the column. He wanted to check the man’s injuries first.

“Who!”

Hearing a rustling sound behind him, the man tensed. Thinking it was an enemy chasing after him, he pulled out a dagger from his waist and slashed at Su Nantian.

“Don’t be reckless. It’s me.”

Su Nantian reacted faster than him, grabbing the man's wrist to prevent the dagger from falling. Then he pulled forward with force, causing them to collide head-on.

“Ah, Big Brother!”

The subordinate clearly recognized Su Nantian. In fact, he had risked everything to wait for Su Nantian’s arrival.

He spoke urgently: “Big Brother, Hu Ge has an urgent matter to see you!”

“Hu Ge wants to see me?”

Su Nantian was taken aback. The subordinate nodded repeatedly: “Yes, Hu Ge was attacked this evening and even had his phone stolen. He didn’t have your contact info, so he sent me here to wait for you.”

Su Nantian could tell the man was telling the truth. After all, he himself had his own wounds. If it weren’t for a major issue, Lanban Hu wouldn’t have acted so urgently.

The subordinate spoke while pulling out his phone to call Lanban Hu, arranging a direct conversation between them.

“Big Brother, it’s bad news!”

After the call connected, Lanban Hu's anxious voice came through: “What’s wrong?”

Su Nantian was taken aback, then realized he had assigned a task to Lanban Hu. Had something gone wrong on that end?

Indeed, Lanban Hu said: “Big Brother, Lü Shan from Jiangcheng’s underworld has issued a challenge to you directly. If you don’t come, they’ll attack Xinyue Group’s staff.”

“What?”

Su Nantian was stunned: “Lü Shan? What kind of scum is he, wanting to die?”

This Lü Shan was known as “Shan Ge,” which sounded crude but he was a notorious thug in Jiangcheng. Given Lanban Hu’s status in the underworld, he definitely couldn’t match him.

This situation was partly due to Su Nantian’s rapid actions. He had secretly supported Lanban Hu in fighting for territory, which had threatened Lü Shan. Thus, Lü Shan decided to settle the matter with force.

“Of course, I’ve already warned Lü Shan,” Lanban Hu sighed. “But Lü Shan found out about Xinyue Group’s affairs, and with his personality, I’m worried he might go desperate…”

“Big Brother, what should we do? I thought he’d at least respect your status, but he still dared to challenge you. Could there be a trap?” Lanban Hu asked anxiously.

“Who cares about the trap? Even if there is one, what can it do?”

Su Nantian coldly replied: “Lü Shan dares to threaten me. I’ll see where he gets the nerve! Where and when?”

“Location is remote, in Jiangcheng’s outskirts. And it's tonight at nine o’clock. That’s why I’m worried about a trap…”

After saying this, Lanban Hu quickly asked: “Big Brother, should I gather people?”

“No,” Su Nantian said with a cold expression: “Since Lü Shan specifically named me, I’ll go alone to meet them!”

“Big Brother, going alone is too risky. Let the brothers accompany you,” Lanban Hu said.

Su Nantian’s words shocked Lanban Hu. Though he had seen Su Nantian's skills before, who knew what kind of Hongmen Banquet Lü Shan had set up? If there was a trap or ambush, Su Nantian going alone would be extremely dangerous.

After all, even if Su Nantian was skilled, he was just one person. What if Lü Shan had a gun?

Hearing Su Nantian planned to go alone, Lanban Hu immediately thought of many possibilities.

Chapter 343: The如意 Plan

Su Nantian didn’t think as much as Lanban Hu did. He thought simply: if this Lü Shan insisted on playing dead, he had to make sure the man disappeared from Jiangcheng completely. Otherwise, with his vengeful nature, there would be more retaliation in the future. Only by eliminating him entirely could he rest easy.

Su Nantian thought, after dealing with Lü Shan’s group, it would be possible to integrate some smaller forces in Jiangcheng's underworld.

Of course, to fully control all of Jiangcheng’s underground forces would take years of careful management. This path was indeed long and arduous.

“Don’t worry, these little dogs are enough for me to handle alone.”

Faced with Lanban Hu’s concern, Su Nantian said calmly: “Don’t you trust my strength?”

“Alright,” Lanban Hu, seeing Su Nantian had said so, didn’t say anything more.

Besides, even if he brought people, it wouldn’t help Su Nantian much.

Because if there was an enemy Su Nantian couldn’t fight, would bringing people over help him win?

“I don’t need you to worry about me. Just protect Xinyue Group’s people in the shadows.”

Su Nantian's voice sounded serious: “I have only one request for you—do your part. If you can do that, I won’t disappoint you.”

“Don’t worry, Big Brother. I’ll guarantee their safety with my head!”

Lanban Hu’s voice was also serious: “I, Lanban Hu, may not be much, but I can say something in Jiangcheng. As long as they don’t leave Jiangcheng, I’ll guarantee their safety and no one will threaten them. If anyone dares to threaten them, they must step over my corpse first!”

“Good, with that promise I’m at ease.”

Su Nantian said calmly: “Alright, tell me the location.”

“I’ll send you the coordinates right away,” Lanban Hu said and hung up. He then sent Su Nantian the location.

Su Nantian looked at the coordinates and frowned slightly. The location was indeed remote, over ten miles from Jiangcheng, in a secluded area near the Yanling Highway.

In years past, there had been many cars on Yanling Highway, but with the recent tunnel opening, fewer people used it. Thus, the area around Yanling Highway in Jiangcheng’s outskirts could be described as desolate and uninhabited.

Lü Shan choosing this place clearly had ulterior motives. Such a location would make any incident go unheard and unseen, perfect for doing underhanded things.

“Seems Lü Shan didn’t have good intentions with this challenge…” Su Nantian coldly smiled, a slight curve on his lips.

If one were rational, the wisest choice would be to refuse. After all, there was no need to accept a one-sided challenge.

But Su Nantian wasn’t someone who feared trouble. He wanted to see what kind of Hongmen Banquet this so-called Lü Shan had set up for him.

“Nine o’clock tonight, right?”

Su Nantian checked the time. It was currently 7:30 PM. Driving from here to the Yanling Highway in the outskirts would take about an hour. It was perfect to leave at 8 PM.

“Never mind, I’ll go now. Going early can let me check the situation ahead of time,” Su Nantian thought.

Though he didn’t regard Lü Shan highly, if he had to be cautious against such a small local thug in Jiangcheng, how could he talk about “Dragon Roars Nine Heavens”?

After all, the real big families and forces were hundreds of times stronger than Lü Shan or Lanban Hu.

Of course, Su Nantian had confidence in himself. But confidence was one thing; being cautious was another.

In the past, Su Nantian had always been careful. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have survived so long amidst constant sword and gun battles.

Su Nantian called his secretary Han Nana to inform her, then drove towards the outskirts. Yue Xiaoshan was inside attending the banquet; under public view, her safety would be guaranteed, so he didn’t need to worry too much.

At that moment, near the Yanling Highway about ten miles from Jiangcheng’s outskirts, there was a desolate small forest.

Inside this small forest were a group of people—Lü Shan’s subordinates, with Lü Shan himself among them.

“Shan Ge, are we really going to challenge this kid?”

One subordinate spoke with a hesitant tone. The image of Su Nantian as a warrior had already spread.

He spoke with difficulty: “That kid named Su Nantian, they say he defeated dozens of Lanban Hu’s men alone. We only have about ten people today; how can we fight him?”

“Don’t worry, I’ve brought a real expert.”

Lü Shan said confidently: “With this expert’s help, no matter how strong Su Nantian is, he’ll definitely lose. A little kid like him dares to ride over my head? I’ll let him know what pain is tonight!”

“Ah, Shan Ge has brought an expert.” The subordinates in the forest finally felt relieved.

“Shan Ge, where’s this expert? I don’t see him yet.”

“Why so impatient? Experts always have their own style. Usually, they don’t appear until the end.”

Lü Shan said with a sinister face: “You can rest easy. This expert is definitely an expert among experts. I spent millions to hire him!”

“What?” The subordinates were shocked.

Lü Shan had spent millions just to deal with one person. It seemed this Su Nantian truly angered him.

“Lanban Hu found this kid named Su Nantian and tried to challenge us,” Lü Shan sneered: “He thought he could find experts, but I can too!”

“After we deal with this Su Nantian tonight, the rest of Lanban Hu’s group will be easy to handle.”

“After swallowing up Lanban Hu, I’ll have half of Jiangcheng. Who dares to defy me?”

“Shan Ge, what if this kid doesn’t come?” One subordinate worried: “We set the place so remote. Even a fool would see something’s wrong. If he’s smart, he wouldn’t come…”

“That kid will come,” Lü Shan coldly said: “My instinct tells me no one else has the guts, but Su Nantian definitely does. If he doesn’t come, then Xinyue Group’s people will be in trouble…”

“Is that so?” At this moment, a cold voice echoed.

Chapter 344: Delay

“Who? Who’s talking?”

Everyone, including Lü Shan, was startled. How could there be someone else here they hadn’t noticed?

“I came,” a figure stepped out from the shadows into this small forest. It was Su Nantian!

After parking his car nearby, he walked towards here. Unexpectedly, he had just arrived when he heard Lü Shan speaking.

“You kid really came!”

Seeing Su Nantian, Lü Shan sneered: “Heaven has a path you don’t take; hell has no gate, yet you still walk in. Kid, come over and kneel to apologize!”

“Idiot.” Su Nantian didn’t bother arguing, walking directly towards him.

“You dare to come near me!” Lü Shan saw this and was a bit nervous, clearly fearing Su Nantian’s skills.

“Did you issue a challenge? I’ve come to accept it.”

Su Nantian said calmly: “Who’s fighting me? Well, I don’t see any of you as worth it. Why not fight together? That might give you a chance.”

“Kid, don’t be so arrogant!”

These subordinates of Lü Shan couldn’t tolerate Su Nantian’s insult. They shouted: “Even if you’re strong, what does that mean? Do you think you can be invincible?”

“I don’t know if I’m invincible, but defeating you is like beating a dog,” Su Nantian said coldly: “I don’t want to waste words. Single combat or all of you?”

“Kid, the challenge was set for nine o’clock. It’s only 8:30 now. Did you come too early?”

Lü Shan said with a dark face: “Did you come too soon?”

“Who cares when I came?”

Su Nantian coldly smiled: “Are you saying your trap or ambush isn’t ready yet? Want me to give you more time?”

“Shan Ge, what should we do?”

These subordinates whispered to Lü Shan: “You’ve hired this expert, but he hasn’t arrived yet. This kid came early. Even if we all fight him, it seems we’re not his match.”

“Why panic? I’ve secretly sent a message to the expert. He’ll be here soon. This kid can laugh now, but once the expert arrives, he won’t be laughing for long.”

Lü Shan gave his subordinates a signal: “What we need to do now is delay time. Once the expert arrives, everything will be fine!”

“How to delay? This kid isn’t an idiot…”

“Let me challenge you!”

At this moment, one subordinate gritted his teeth and stepped forward, shouting at Su Nantian: “Dare you fight me?”

“Me?”

Su Nantian looked at the man who stepped forward and almost laughed.

This man was definitely a martial artist, but his level wasn’t good—nothing more than a half-baked one. Not to mention Su Nantian, even Xinyue’s security could easily take him down.

“Yes, me.”

The man challenged Su Nantian: “Or are you afraid to fight me? If so, kneel and apologize to our boss. He might forgive you!”

“Alright, I’ll fight you.”

Su Nantian nodded and beckoned him: “Come on.”

Seeing Su Nantian agree, the man was suddenly nervous.

He had only stepped forward to delay time and didn’t want to fight Su Nantian directly. But seeing Lü Shan’s gaze, he could only force himself to fight.

“I’ll fight you!”

The man shouted and rushed towards Su Nantian. He looked quite fierce, hitting Su Nantian’s chest with a punch.

“Hit him?” The man felt excited.

The next moment, he saw Su Nantian standing still before him, expressionless: “Did you not eat? Or are you just tickling me?”

“You…” He was angry.

“Shut up!” Su Nantian countered with a slap.

The man’s right cheek was slapped, swelling high and losing two teeth. His eyelids flipped, and his body collapsed, falling unconscious.

The man who had just been fierce was knocked out by Su Nantian’s slap.

“Anyone else?” Su Nantian didn’t look at him but turned his gaze to the remaining Lü Shan and others.

No one spoke. At this moment, Lü Shan said quietly: “Who will challenge this kid? After success, each gets one million. I don’t ask you to beat him; just delay a bit.”

“I’ll do it!”

“Me too!”

Under the temptation of money, Lü Shan’s subordinates rushed forward.

Although they were indeed afraid of Su Nantian's skills, they thought it was just a beating. Getting beaten for one million was worth it.

“Kid, I’ll challenge you!”

“I’ll challenge you too!”

“Alright, fight together,” Su Nantian said calmly.

“No, fighting together isn’t heroic. We want to fight you one-on-one!” They spoke with a noble tone, making Su Nantian almost laugh.

He had already realized these people were delaying time, as if waiting for someone.

In such a situation, the correct approach would be to deal with these people immediately. But Su Nantian deliberately wanted to see who they were waiting for.

So he nodded: “Alright, since you want to fight one by one, then so be it. But fists and feet are no words; breaking bones is inevitable.”

“Don’t be arrogant!”

One subordinate rushed towards Su Nantian but was immediately kicked back, flying several meters away.

“Ah!”

This man screamed and fell to the ground, clutching his stomach in pain, rolling on the ground as if trying to get up.

“Still want to fight?” Su Nantian raised his eyebrows.

This man, seeing this, trembled and dared not struggle. He lay still on the ground without moving.

Su Nantian said calmly: “Next.”

Pound after pound, one by one of the subordinates fell before Su Nantian. Lü Shan’s expression grew increasingly grim.

“Lü Shan, your subordinates seem useless,” Su Nantian said after knocking down another subordinate and looked at Lü Shan: “Why don’t you fight? How can a boss not fight? Are you letting these subordinates look down on you?”

“Kid, don’t be so arrogant!”

Lü Shan was furious and opened his mouth to say something but at that moment, saw a figure approaching from the distance. His eyes lit up and he laughed heartily.

Chapter 345: The Difference in Temperament

“Ha! Kid, you’re done. My expert has arrived. I’ll see if you can still laugh!”

“Oh, is that so?”

Su Nantian raised his eyebrows and heard footsteps behind him. Turning around, he indeed saw someone approaching.

The man wasn’t tall—about 170 cm. He could even be described as thin. When he stepped out of the darkness and into the moonlight, he was a man with slightly dark skin.

The man looked calm and walked confidently.

“Hey… Master An, you’ve finally arrived.” Seeing the man’s appearance, Lü Shan hurriedly ran over.

Liu An nodded slightly and looked at Su Nantian, frowning: “You want me to deal with this person?”

“Yes, it’s him.”

Lü Shan said with a sinister face: “This kid is arrogant. He has beaten all my subordinates. Master An, please give him a lesson and break both his hands first.”

“Lü Shan.”

This man named Liu An looked at Su Nantian and suddenly shook his head: “You said I was to deal with a minor, but this kid is also an expert of the eighth level.”

“No, three million isn’t enough to deal with someone like this. You must add money.”

“What? Add money?”

Lü Shan’s face changed. This was clearly a price hike. He felt slightly annoyed.

He had already spent three million, and for the past two days, he had treated this man to five-star hotels with lavish meals. The money spent was at least thirty or forty thousand.

But now this man wanted to add more, acting as if he wouldn’t fight unless money was added.

“Add money? Master An, how much do you want?”

Lü Shan’s face darkened. He thought it was just money, but as long as he could eliminate this Su Nantian, after swallowing up Lanban Hu’s forces and controlling half of Jiangcheng's underworld, he wouldn’t worry about money.

“I don’t think this kid is easy to deal with.”

Liu An licked his lips: “One hand one million, two hands two million. Legs and hands are the same—each one million…”

“Life? I want his life. How much more?” Lü Shan said with a sinister face.

“Do you want this kid’s life?”

Liu An suddenly laughed and raised one finger: “To take this kid’s life, you must add ten million.”

“Ten million?” Lü Shan's mouth twitched.

His annual profit was only ten million. And with many expenses, he barely saved anything. His current assets were just that, and if he spent everything, it would almost empty his resources.

“Alright, break both hands and feet,” Lü Shan thought. He didn’t need to have this Liu An kill Su Nantian. If he crippled him, it would be at his mercy.

“Breaking all hands and feet requires four million.”

“Four million, then four million!” Lü Shan gritted his teeth: “As long as there are no problems.”

“Don’t worry. I only care about money. If it’s not a problem, then nothing is.”

Saying this, Liu An looked at Su Nantian with a calm face: “I didn’t expect you to be so young and reach this level. You’re definitely not an ordinary person. What’s your background?”

“You don’t need to know my background,” Su Nantian coldly smiled.

This Liu An was indeed strong, and his combat power was even higher than Su Nantian’s. He was a ruthless character, which Su Nantian hadn’t expected. Lü Shan, a local thug, had managed to hire him.

“Millions to take my life? Seems my life isn’t worth much…”

Su Nantian almost laughed. Lü Shan spending millions to hire someone to kill him was obviously a joke.

“Good kid, you’re really bold!”

Liu An licked his lips with a red tongue and said cruelly: “I like bold people. They’re more fun to deal with!”

“I don’t care where you came from, but since someone paid me to fight you, it’s your fault for picking the wrong person.”

At last, Liu An looked at Su Nantian with a calm face, like a cat watching a mouse: “Kid, you must know what kind of strength I have, right?”

“Shan Ge, what’s this expert talking about? Are they like martial arts masters from movies?”

One of Lü Shan’s subordinates asked confusedly. Another said: “Don’t guess, let’s just move away and watch these two fight…”

“Hmph,” Su Nantian said calmly: “Do you think you’re so strong?”

“Arrogant!” Liu An’s face darkened: “Do you know how strong I am? How dare you be so reckless? Where did you get the courage?”

“Where do I get the courage?”

Su Nantian smiled coldly. Over the years, he had killed more than ten first-rate experts and even some stronger ones.

This Liu An was slightly better in combat power than Su Nantian, but he had no fear at all.

“Kid, being bold is fine, but too bold brings death.” Liu An’s eyes turned cruel, as if he had been provoked by Su Nantian.

“Your words are too many.” Su Nantian said expressionlessly: “The person Lü Shan sent to fight me must be you. Since that’s the case, no need to waste time. I’m waiting to go home and sleep.”

“Die!” Liu An was furious.

He couldn’t bear Su Nantian’s mockery. With a step forward, he rushed at Su Nantian like a tiger.

The battle was about endurance and willpower.

Su Nantian had survived many near-death experiences, fighting against the devil himself. Pain couldn’t affect his willpower.

But Liu An was different. The environment in the country was good, with peace and prosperity. He had been respected for his strength, enjoying wealth and honor easily. His will to fight with all his might had been eroded. He rarely fought with life on the line.

More importantly, he and Su Nantian had no grudge. If it weren’t for his pride, he would have already given up and begged for mercy.

One was fearless, ignoring everything; the other was timid, hesitating.

Even if Liu An’s combat power was slightly higher than Su Nantian's, in such a life-and-death battle, he would still fall to Su Nantian!

At this moment, Liu An screamed and his power plummeted. His tower-like body collapsed helplessly to the ground, no longer caring about the face of a master. He begged Su Nantian: “I surrender! I’m sorry, please let me go! I lost!”

Chapter 346: Aftermath

Liu An’s begging was laced with hatred. He just felt he couldn’t risk his life for four million, but the grudge with Su Nantian was already set. If he escaped this time, he would definitely retaliate tenfold.

But Su Nantian was no soft-hearted person. Liu An had come for him, and he knew the truth about eliminating roots.

Su Nantian looked at Liu An without expression. As Liu An was about to use temptation, his ten fingers were severed.

“Ah!”

Liu An immediately broke out in sweat and rolled on the ground, crying out painfully. His agonizing scream was particularly terrifying in this dark forest.

“Su Nantian, if you have the guts, kill me. Otherwise, I’ll definitely kill your whole family!” Liu An, trembling all over, cursed Su Nantian with hatred.

“Want to die? You dream too much!”

Su Nantian’s face curled into a cold smile. Liu An still had some value, so killing him immediately was not good. Capturing and torturing him might yield unexpected results.

Thinking this, Su Nantian struck Liu An’s neck with a palm. Even the pain of ten fingers couldn’t wake him up.

Liu An’s scream stopped abruptly. Su Nantian turned his gaze to Lü Shan.

“Su Nantian, I tell you not to act recklessly. We are in a country of law. If you attack me, the state won’t let it go!”

Sweating profusely, Lü Shan looked at Su Nantian like a god. His body trembled like a sieve, his voice harsh but inner fear.

His regret was as if it could fill five lakes and three rivers, endless. His hatred for Liu An was even more intense. He had already overcharged four million and failed to complete the task, which made him a fool.

“Ah? I didn’t expect Lü Shan to be such a patriotic youth?” Su Nantian’s mouth curled, mocking and ridiculing him as he walked towards Lü Shan.

With every step Su Nantian took, Lü Shan and his subordinates retreated. Their expressions were frightened, their steps hurried. After a few steps, they fell to the ground, fearfully watching Su Nantian approach.

“Don’t… don’t… Big Brother, it was my mistake. I’m willing to apologize. I’ll pay four million for my dog’s life!”

Lü Shan couldn’t bear the fear anymore and fell to his knees, begging for mercy.

“Four million for your dog’s life?”

Su Nantian had a strange expression. Oh, you bastard, that expert was four million, right? So the price of a dog’s life is four million?

“No… no, Big Brother, it's my dog’s life. I’m willing to pay ten million, ten million!” Lü Shan realized his mistake and quickly increased the price to calm Su Nantian’s anger.

“Then my life isn’t as valuable as yours?”

Su Nantian was amused. He slapped Lü Shan to the ground, his cold gaze scanning over all the subordinates. No one dared to meet his eyes; they all averted their gaze, avoiding contact.

“Big Brother, spare me! Spare me! Whatever you want, I can give it to you—beauty or wealth. Just let me go!”

Lü Shan was completely panicked, calculating gains and losses in his mind. Ultimately, his life was more important.

“You’re wise, but I don’t want anything. I just want your life!”

Su Nantian shook his head and kicked Lü Shan, knocking him out. He didn’t kill him immediately for the same reason as Liu An.

Looking at Lü Shan’s subordinates, a dark mass huddled together. Su Nantian furrowed his brows, thinking about how to handle it. Then he heard a commotion and turned around—Lanban Hu had arrived with people to support!

“How did you come?” Su Nantian asked calmly.

Sweating from rushing over, Lanban Hu wiped his forehead and glanced around before smiling politely: “Big Brother, I don’t doubt your skills. But these scum are numerous and strong; I’m afraid they’ll dirty your hands. Let my men deal with these trash!”

“Alright, take these two to the side and wake them up. See if we can get something useful.”

Su Nantian nodded with a smile and kicked Liu An and Lü Shan by the side, instructing Lanban Hu.

Lanban Hu quickly agreed and ordered his men to take them. Lü Shan’s people didn’t resist at all, and were quickly subdued by Lanban Hu's men.

“Big Brother, what’s next?” Lanban Hu approached Su Nantian and asked respectfully.

“Let your men take over Lü Shan’s territory and people. In a few days, I’ll assign you tasks.”

Su Nantian took a deep breath and calmed his mind, telling Lanban Hu.

For now, that was it. As for what to do next, he hadn’t decided yet. But as the saying goes, water comes and earth blocks it; soldiers come and generals meet them. He wasn’t afraid of any challenge.

Lanban Hu nodded in agreement, then added: “Everything at Xinyue is arranged. If anything happens, I’ll take necessary measures immediately.”

Su Nantian turned to look at Lanban Hu and smiled, patting his shoulder: “You handle it, I trust you!”

Lanban Hu was stunned and replied loudly: “Thank you for your trust, Big Brother!”

They continued to chat and catch up. Soon after, the interrogation yielded results.
