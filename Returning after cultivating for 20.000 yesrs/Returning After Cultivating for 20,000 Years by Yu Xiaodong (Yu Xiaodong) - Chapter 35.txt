“Right now, it's about Shen Fei. His father's cunning is no less than Shen Fei's. Now you've beaten him so badly he can't even breathe properly…”

Su Nantian waved his hand dismissively. “Although I did hit him with a little force, it's not as bad as you say. Don’t worry, he won't die.”

Yuan Xiong didn’t think so. He frowned and said, “He won't die, but he won't be able to get out of bed for at least ten days or half a month. His father definitely won’t let this go.”

“Ten days? Hmph, even half a year might not be enough for him to get out of bed.” Su Nantian said coldly.

Yuan Xiong was stunned again, his jaw nearly dropping to the ground.

“Half a year? My god!”

Yuan Xiong felt a wave of fear. This mustn’t result in a death.

Yuan Xiong wiped the sweat from his forehead, still trying to persuade Su Nantian. He was afraid he’d cause another big problem when he went back.

“You should reconsider what I told you earlier. Shen Fei’s father has more power in Fengcheng than it seems. The Shen family still holds some influence. You beat Shen Fei so badly, his father will definitely come after you!”

Yuan Xiong wiped his fat face and fell into thought.

“Simply put, you now have enemies in Fengcheng, in the north, and even at school with the Taekwondo club. You’re surrounded on all sides unless you don’t leave your house.”

Yuan Xiong had said so much that Su Nantian’s ears were about to go numb.

Yuan Xiong, exhausted from speaking, had analyzed every single person involved with Su Nantian. But when he looked at Su Nantian, who was calmly sipping tea with an indifferent expression, he realized Su Nantian didn’t take any of them seriously.

Su Nantian’s attitude shocked Yuan Xiong completely.

Yuan Xiong subconsciously touched his dry throat, thinking: Who is this Su Nantian?

Now that Yuan Xiong had explained everything in detail to Su Nantian, but Su Nantian still remained indifferent.

Either Su Nantian had a big secret he didn’t know about, or this young man was simply unaware of his own insignificance.

Yuan Xiong thought more and more that Su Nantian was no ordinary person, and his relationship with the Gao family wasn’t what he thought.

Su Nantian had noticed someone was drugged instantly, which was no easy feat. He didn’t claim to have met many extraordinary people, but he had seen some strange things in his time.

But no one else could have diagnosed their condition and written a prescription so fluently.

Even the Gao family might not fully protect him, unless there was an unknown secret between them. Otherwise, why would Su Nantian be so calm?

Thinking of this, Yuan Xiong looked at Su Nantian again, feeling even more puzzled.

Yuan Xiong sighed deeply. At this point, he had no way to change the situation. He’d said everything, and whether Su Nantian listened was up to him.

Yuan Xiong wiped his face and focused on the tea on the table. He noticed that Su Nantian’s tea was so clear and fragrant, its aroma enhanced to an extraordinary level. The color of the tea was far superior to his own.

Yuan Xiong suddenly remembered that he had spent years studying tea in his office. Now, Su Nantian’s tea was like heaven and earth apart from his own.

This shocked Yuan Xiong again, adding another layer of curiosity to his gaze toward Su Nantian.

Before Yuan Xiong could ask, Su Nantian had already finished the last sip of tea.

Su Nantian placed his empty cup on the table and looked at Yuan Xiong, saying, “You’ve talked too much today. You know what you should and shouldn’t ask. I can handle this myself.”

Yuan Xiong smiled bitterly, thinking Su Nantian still hadn’t listened. Since Su Nantian had said that, he couldn’t say anything more.

Su Nantian spoke calmly: “Those people are just ants to me, and you’re not even an ant.”

Yuan Xiong’s lips twitched.

After a pause, Su Nantian added, “But since they are students at the school, there might be some unexpected events during my resolution.”

Yuan Xiong inhaled sharply. It wasn’t that he was cowardly, but he knew Su Nantian was truly a troublemaker.

Seeing Yuan Xiong’s reaction, he felt amused—like a principal and a coward.

Su Nantian smiled, “Of course, during this time, I’ll try to minimize the damage to the school. But you just need to do one thing.”

Yuan Xiong heard that he needed help, and immediately felt a hint of reluctance.

But before Yuan Xiong could refuse, Su Nantian said, “Just let me stay at the school.”

Yuan Xiong was stunned. He thought it would be a big scheme, but it turned out to be such a small thing. Yuan Xiong quickly smiled and said, “This is no problem, Mr. Su. I’ll take care of it. Even if I get fired, you won’t be.”

Since Su Nantian had stared at him once, Yuan Xiong changed his title.

Su Nantian smiled without exposing Yuan Xiong’s thoughts. However, Su Nantian couldn’t stand Yuan Xiong’s office anymore after listening to his long-winded speech. He was already bored.

“I’ll go first,” Su Nantian said.

Yuan Xiong nodded quickly.

Chapter 163: The Furious Woman’s Outburst

“You go slowly.” He stood up immediately to see him off.

Yuan Xiong smiled with wrinkles on his face as Su Nantian hadn’t even stepped out of the office door.

But once Su Nantian’s foot had just left, Yuan Xiong’s face immediately relaxed. He sighed heavily and sank back into the sofa.

Finally, he had sent this old man away. Remembering that one look, his heart was still cold to this day.

His short fingers picked up a teacup and poured Su Nantian’s clear tea into it. He took a sip, then clicked his lips, “This is really good.”

…

Su Nantian left the office and walked toward the classroom.

As he reached near the classroom, he saw a crowd gathered around it and frowned again.

“What’s going on?” Su Nantian was confused. He clearly remembered that the students around the classroom had been dispersed by school leaders before he went to the office. Now, who were these people?

“Make way.”

Su Nantian pushed his way in. After entering the outer layer, he realized these students were just on the periphery. Inside was a group of people in uniforms, familiar to him.

They surrounded the classroom completely. Two people stood at the entrance, preventing anyone from entering or leaving.

Plus their standard equipment.

Su Nantian examined them again and realized they were the Patrol Team.

“What’s going on?” Su Nantian was confused, so he grabbed a student nearby to ask.

It just happened that Su Nantian was a new student, and few people in this large school knew him.

The girl felt startled when Su Nantian patted her shoulder and saw such a stunning male student behind her. Her cheeks turned red, and she shyly glanced at Su Nantian before speaking.

“Hey, you’re a new student, right? In your class, there’s one who’s famous—Su Nantian. This is his classroom. Today he beat the class monitor so badly he’s in critical condition!”

Su Nantian’s lips twitched. Was Shen Fei that weak? A critical condition was unnecessary; it was just his bones shattered.

The girl didn’t notice Su Nantian’s reaction and continued to share what she had heard.

“Shen Fei was taken away by an ambulance, and Su Nantian was called to the principal’s office. He hasn’t come out yet!”

Su Nantian thought, he had already come out and was right in front of you.

The girl continued, “This matter should have been resolved properly, but Shen Fei seems to have some power in Fengcheng. That’s why his mother and father brought the Patrol Team, saying they wanted to protect the first scene. They’ve surrounded the classroom.”

Su Nantian was amused, “It’s not like they killed my son. First scene?”

After understanding the situation, Su Nantian pushed forward a few steps and finally saw clearly.

Inside the classroom was another group of people gathered around, who were Zhu Ying.

Su Nantian wondered why Zhu Ying was here instead of at the hospital checking on Shen Fei.

He pulled the girl over again and asked, “Zhu Ying Teacher went to the hospital to check on Shen Fei, right? Why is she here?”

The girl was grabbed by Su Nantian’s arm and felt a flutter in her heart. When she heard Su Nantian ask, she quickly explained, “Yes, I heard Yuan Xiong arranged for Zhu Ying Teacher to go to the hospital. She went to the office to get a car key and was taken here by these people!”

At that moment, a loud voice came from the crowd.

“You’re such a bad teacher! My son just started school, and he was bullied into critical condition!”

This rough and angry voice immediately silenced the murmurs of the crowd. Zhu Ying was also timid, quickly waving her hands to explain, “No, Ms. Liu, please let me explain…”

“You don’t need to explain! Can you explain it?” Liu Mei waved her hand, determined to get justice for her son’s first injury. “My son was injured in your class! You can’t escape responsibility! Don’t explain! What you say is useless. Now I just know my son was injured! You’re still here calmly explaining! Explain what!”

Zhu Ying had never met such an unreasonable person. Shen Fei was indeed injured in her class, but he couldn’t be so unreasonable.

Su Nantian observed the middle-aged woman with her hands on her hips in the crowd. She was dressed extravagantly, wearing multiple pearl necklaces around her neck. Her hands had only two fingers bare, while the others were adorned with rings.

She waved her hands wildly as she scolded, and the diamond rings on her fingers glittered.

Su Nantian had always disliked such women—arrogant, impolite, and ostentatious.

But Liu Mei had more than just these flaws; her verbal combat skills were strong. In no time, she had scolded Zhu Ying into tears.

Zhu Ying was confused and took a few steps back, but Liu Mei followed her closely with scolding.

“You look like a person! People who know you think you teach at the school, but people who don’t might think you’re laughing in a brothel! Look at your cheap clothes, are you afraid of wearing too much?”

Liu Mei stepped forward and her body shook with over a hundred pounds of fat. She pointed at Zhu Ying’s tight long dress and said, “It’s obvious that Liu Mei was jealous of Zhu Ying’s curves because her own body had become so unattractive. Otherwise, how could anyone criticize Zhu Ying for wearing too little?”

When Liu Mei said this, Zhu Ying’s face turned from pale to red instantly, and her eyes filled with tears.

“You… you!”

“You what! You don’t know who I am?” Liu Mei was clearly used to scolding people, and her skills were far beyond Zhu Ying’s quiet nature.

“First look at what kind of person you are, then talk about me! You come to school dressed like this every day. Do you know if you’re teaching or seducing my son! Hmph!” Liu Mei’s eyes narrowed dangerously: “Maybe you didn’t seduce my son, so you incited that bastard Su to attack him!”

This statement made Zhu Ying sway and feel dizzy. Even the surrounding students were upset.

Chapter 164: Shen Huayun

Unfortunately, the students’ strength couldn’t match the Patrol Team. They just clenched their fists and dared not do anything excessive.

Su Nantian listened to the woman’s scolding, his anger gradually rising. People like Liu Mei couldn’t be reasoned with.

But since there was a reason, Su Nantian felt the most important thing now was to go forward and rescue Zhu Ying.

Su Nantian took two steps and pushed aside the Patrol Team member blocking his way. The member felt an irresistible force pushing him aside.

When he regained consciousness, the Patrol Team member saw Su Nantian had already entered the classroom.

“Hey! That student can’t go in!” The member hurriedly called out to the people inside, “Stop him!”

Su Nantian was no one who could be caught easily.

His figure flickered, and the surrounding Patrol Team members were pushed aside, leaving a wide path.

Anyone pushed by Su Nantian was stunned because they couldn’t believe a normal person had such power.

Su Nantian, with a dark face, rushed straight into the crowd and supported Zhu Ying’s slender waist to prevent her from falling.

After being supported by Su Nantian, Zhu Ying gradually regained consciousness. She looked up at Su Nantian who had arrived and felt like crying into his arms.

Because of Su Nantian’s arrival, Liu Mei was stunned and then saw Su Nantian holding Zhu Ying. She sneered, “What’s this? Your lover came?” She crossed her arms and looked at the two with disdain.

Su Nantian’s eyes darkened, “You’ve been insulting Zhu Ying Teacher since the beginning because of your son, right?”

Liu Mei heard something unusual in Su Nantian’s words and immediately became serious.

Su Nantian continued, “How come you don’t recognize the person who beat your son?”

This statement completely enraged Liu Mei, making her tremble with anger and point at Su Nantian, spittle flying everywhere.

“Good! It’s you, this heartless person who dared to beat my precious son!”

Su Nantian looked at Liu Mei with disdain and didn’t respond. He didn’t want to explain.

Seeing Su Nantian remain silent, Liu Mei’s temper grew even more? She stared at Su Nantian who was supporting Zhu Ying and suddenly laughed.

“Originally, this slut seduced my son and sent her lover to beat him like that!”

Su Nantian’s eyebrows furrowed, and his tone turned cold.

“I warn you, don’t insult others here without proof.”

Liu Mei just laughed mysteriously. “Who did I insult? Look at the two of you hugging! The woman is a slut, and the man is an animal! No wonder they could get together!”

Su Nantian had lived for two thousand years, and the environment around him no longer had people like this.

After rebirth, he encountered such people again and felt extremely disgusted.

Su Nantian coldly said, “Last warning, don’t speak so rudely or your tongue will be in trouble.”

“Ah!” Liu Mei thought it was the funniest joke she had ever heard, and her whole body seemed to explode. “What do you mean! You beat my son and don’t let me scold him a little? Do you want to hit me too!”

Liu Mei shouted and stepped forward. Su Nantian saw Liu Mei’s sagging breasts almost touching his arm, so he frowned and supported Zhu Ying before stepping back a few steps. His disdain was unmistakable.

Liu Mei thought Su Nantian was afraid of her. Today, she had brought the Patrol Team to get back the honor for her son and restore the Shen family’s dignity, and also wanted to severely punish the culprit.

Now seeing Su Nantian retreat a few steps, Liu Mei was excited and extended her hand to slap him.

Su Nantian’s eyes narrowed, and Liu Mei’s movement seemed to slow down several times in his view. This middle-aged woman’s attack was full of flaws in Su Nantian’s eyes.

Although Su Nantian was still supporting Zhu Ying, his long leg had already prepared to kick Liu Mei out.

But before Liu Mei’s slap reached Su Nantian, it was intercepted mid-air.

Liu Mei looked at the source of this force and widened her eyes in surprise.

“What are you doing!” Liu Mei reacted and glared at the man blocking her.

“Shen Huayun! Don’t you want to avenge your son? Let go of me!” Liu Mei struggled, trying to get Shen Huayun to release her arm.

But Shen Huayun still tightly held onto her arm without letting go.

“Be quiet for a moment!” Shen Huayun shouted, and Liu Mei was clearly out of her mind. After being yelled at by Shen Huayun, she suddenly regained consciousness.

“You dare to yell at me! You yell at me!”

Shen Huayun didn’t care about Liu Mei’s reaction and pulled her behind him.

Su Nantian watched the two people with interest. From Liu Mei’s conversation with this man, it was obvious that this man was Shen Fei’s father—Shen Huayun.

The one Yuan Xiong described as cunning and treacherous.

He wanted to see how strong this person was.

Although Liu Mei’s slap had been stopped by Shen Huayun, Su Nantian wasn’t about to give up on the idea of punishing Liu Mei.

Su Nantian first helped Zhu Ying sit down by a desk chair, then walked forward and stared at Liu Mei with an ominous expression. “I considered you a woman, but your son deserved it, and so did you!”

As Su Nantian spoke, his fists clenched tightly in secret.

At this moment, a pair of hands grabbed Su Nantian’s clenched fist. Su Nantian followed the force and looked up, discovering that the person was his acquaintance.

The Patrol Team leader, Feng Yue.

“Su Nantian, enough. This matter is too complicated to resolve.” Feng Yue tightly gripped Su Nantian’s fist, and now everyone realized that Su Nantian’s fists had already turned white.

Su Nantian looked deeply at Feng Yue and slowly released his fist.

Liu Mei saw Su Nantian’s clenched fists and was even more furious, almost jumping to hit Su Nantian.

“Old woman, I let you off, but look at your mind! You still want to hit me!” Liu Mei roared.

“Enough!” Shen Huayun, who was beside Liu Mei, frowned and waved his hand. His secretary immediately stepped forward, “Take the lady back to the car!”

Chapter 165: The Boyfriend of Lin Family’s Daughter

The secretary nodded and hurriedly ran to Liu Mei, gently comforting her while secretly pulling her away.

Liu Mei didn’t want to let Su Nantian go so easily, she had been scolding Zhu Ying and felt excited. But seeing Shen Huayun’s expression was already a bit off, she knew it wasn’t that simple.

“Huayun! Huayun! You must avenge our son!”

Su Nantian watched Liu Mei being pulled away, his anger still hadn’t faded. Some people were like this—more face given, more audacity.

After sending Liu Mei away, Shen Huayun turned to Feng Yue and said, “Apologies, I was a bother earlier.”

Feng Yue waved his hand. “No problem, it’s what I should do.”

“Do you know each other?” Shen Huayun pointed at Su Nantian and then at Feng Yue.

Su Nantian didn’t respond, ignoring it. Feng Yue nodded and said, “Yes, we have some connection. Otherwise, Su Brother wouldn’t have given me this favor.”

Shen Huayun nodded in understanding and said to Feng Yue, “Then you go ahead with your work. I’ll talk to this young man.”

Feng Yue felt awkward hearing that. Shen Huayun was clearly overstepping, but there was nothing he could do. The entire Patrol Team was brought by Shen Huayun, and even if Shen Huayun treated him like a servant, it was still necessary.

Feng Yue’s salary included this part.

After Liu Mei left, the crowd surrounding Zhu Ying immediately dispersed. Except for the Patrol Team members cleaning up the scene, there was only Shen Huayun and Su Nantian facing each other.

Shen Huayun coughed into his hand, then opened his mouth: “You’re Su Nantian, right?”

Su Nantian nodded without fear.

Shen Huayun continued, “When you came to the classroom, Zhu Ying Teacher said you were called by Yuan Xiong. I think some things Yuan Xiong definitely told you, right?”

Su Nantian looked at him and said flatly, “Yuan Xiong talked a lot. All were useless nonsense.”

Shen Huayun sneered, and the composure he had faked earlier was already exposed. This was especially similar to his son Shen Fei.

“Good, since Yuan Xiong couldn’t control you, I’ll tell you: beating others is fine, but if you beat my son…” Shen Huayun leaned close to Su Nantian and lowered his voice, “I won’t teach you a lesson, how can I preserve my dignity?”

Su Nantian smiled indifferently and lifted his eyes to look at Shen Huayun, with a hint of contempt in his expression.

Shen Huayun was choked by this gaze and naturally pressed his lips together, then returned to his original volume and said to Su Nantian, “Young man, my son’s martial arts are among the best in Fengcheng. You hit him so hard that he was injured so severely, I suppose your martial arts are also very good. But why haven’t I heard of your name in Fengcheng?”

Su Nantian sneered, “If I didn’t hit hard, it’s because your son was too stupid. He wasn’t even as tough as a sandbag.”

Su Nantian didn’t answer Shen Huayun’s question but refuted the words that gave Shen Fei face.

Shen Huayun’s face instantly darkened, obviously because of the father-son bond. If his son didn’t like Su Nantian, it naturally made the father dislike him too.

But Shen Huayun was deeper than his son, and with a powerful person suddenly appearing in Fengcheng, he must first find out the background. If Su Nantian’s background was not as strong as the Shen family, then Su Nantian would be at their mercy.

Then he would be like a fish on a cutting board.

“You’re so arrogant and unaware of your place. Do you know who your father is?” Shen Huayun pressed, not caring about Su Nantian’s growing impatience. He was determined to find out who Su Nantian's background was.

At this moment, Zhang Xue, who was cleaning up the scene at the back of the classroom, saw Su Nantian confronting Shen Huayun. She was startled and hurriedly ran over to mediate for Su Nantian.

As she got closer, Zhang Xue heard Shen Huayun’s question to Su Nantian and felt a bit annoyed. This person could only be interrogated by her, so what right did Shen Huayun have? She quickened her pace and walked in front of the two, pointing at Su Nantian and saying to Shen Huayun, “Mr. Shen, this is the boyfriend of Miss Lin Suyun.”

Shen Huayun was surprised when he heard Zhang Xue’s statement.

He carefully examined Su Nantian and subconsciously associated him with being supported by Lin Suyun.

After all, a family like the Lin’s would never choose someone he hadn’t heard of in Fengcheng. He secretly felt confused, maybe Lin Suyun had grown up and was having a crush, impulsively found Su Nantian on the street to be her boyfriend?

Shen Huayun looked at Su Nantian with curiosity again. He was handsome and had some strength, but he wasn’t famous. These characteristics combined perfectly with the traits of a boyfriend that girls in Fengcheng usually had.

But it was still Lin’s family… Shen Huayun felt a bit annoyed. The Lin family was one he could never afford to offend, but the humiliation his son Shen Fei had suffered couldn’t be let go so easily.

Otherwise, it would be hard to explain to Liu Mei and even affect Shen Huayun’s reputation in Fengcheng. After all, today Liu Mei had brought the Patrol Team and stormed into the school with such a fierce attitude. It was likely that everyone in Fengcheng now knew about it.

At this point, Shen Huayun fell into silence, thinking about how to deal with Su Nantian.

Meanwhile, because of Zhang Xue’s interruption, Su Nantian had initially felt a glimmer of hope. But after Zhang Xue revealed Su Nantian’s identity, his expression returned to normal.

Zhang Xue didn’t know why she had directly revealed Su Nantian’s identity, but she knew that this matter was now connected to her.

Wait, why did I help this big pervert and let Shen Huayun punish him?

Su Nantian turned to look at Zhang Xue, intending to greet her, but he didn’t expect Zhang Xue to cross her arms and sneer, turning her head away. Su Nantian felt a bit awkward and rubbed his nose.

Ah, women’s hearts are really hard to understand.

Chapter 166: To Catch or Not to Catch

Zhang Xue’s temper was something Su Nantian had a certain understanding of—arrogant, hot-tempered, and a bit vengeful. But considering Zhang Xue’s only virtue, Su Nantian decided to forgive her as long as it didn’t touch the bottom line.

Especially today, Zhang Xue looked particularly beautiful in her uniform, especially those two prominent parts that made Su Nantian glance at them twice.

This girl was the most distinctive among those Su Nantian knew. Perhaps it was due to her profession, or perhaps because of those prominent parts in front.

Every time Zhang Xue proudly walked into Su Nantian’s line of sight, he would unconsciously give her a little more attention.

If Lin Suyun saw Su Nantian’s intense gaze on Zhang Xue, she would definitely get jealous and throw a tantrum.

Su Nantian thought of this and couldn’t help but laugh.

This laughter, however, made Zhang Xue feel that Su Nantian was mocking her. Her face immediately turned dark.

Zhang Xue was different from other girls; she had a bit more arrogance and boldness. But when she was angry, she also had a bit more seductiveness than Lin Suyun.

So every time Zhang Xue was angry or throwing a tantrum, it was different from others in Su Nantian’s eyes.

Zhang Xue glared at Su Nantian, who still had a smile on his face. She felt embarrassed and was confused. This Su Nantian would be better if he were like other men, but every time she saw his stunning appearance and remembered that this pervert had looked at her parts, she would feel a mix of anger and shyness.

This made Zhang Xue very confused.

“What are you laughing at!” Zhang Xue shouted.

“I didn’t laugh.” Su Nantian raised his eyebrows and lied without a blush.

Zhang Xue was furious: “You still say! I heard it! You’re not only a pervert but also a liar!”

Su Nantian looked at Zhang Xue, who was about to jump up in anger. He suddenly felt she was cute and continued to provoke her: “Why are you so concerned about me? Isn’t your Patrol Team’s mission not including this?”

Zhang Xue couldn’t believe her eyes: “Who cares about you!”

Su Nantian put his hands behind his back and looked up at the sky, looking carefree: “Who said it, who cares.”

“You!” Zhang Xue pointed at Su Nantian with her finger, wanting to use the silver handcuffs on her waist to take him away and stop him from talking nonsense!

Su Nantian didn’t respond. He took a few steps back and sat on the chair, closing his eyes to rest.

The whole argument had made Shen Huayun, who was thinking, feel irritated. His desire to punish Su Nantian grew stronger.

Shen Huayun knew he couldn’t afford to offend the Lin family, but he was determined that Su Nantian must be a boyfriend of Lin Suyun. Otherwise, with the Lin family’s power in Fengcheng, it was absolutely impossible for Lin Suyun to choose someone she hadn’t heard of.

A name he hadn’t heard of, perhaps it was just Lin Suyun’s fancy for this face and found a boyfriend. To avoid embarrassment, she had even publicly announced him as her boyfriend.

Shen Huayun thought deeply and added several layers of meaning to Su Nantian and Lin Suyun’s relationship, making Su Nantian’s identity seem completely worthless.

After thinking carefully, he decided that a boyfriend like this was something he could afford to offend. He would just apologize to the Lin family later, and he didn’t believe that Grandpa Lin would scold him for a nameless boy.

Maybe the Lin family would even thank Shen Huayun for eliminating this unsuitable boyfriend.

Shen Fei was Shen Huayun’s most beloved son, and this incident started with anyone. But the result was that his son had been hospitalized.

If this matter ended so easily, he wouldn’t be able to hold his head up again.

After weighing everything carefully, Shen Huayun decided he still needed to punish Su Nantian thoroughly!

At that moment, Shen Huayun’s eyes searched for the Patrol Team leader Feng Yue and said while looking: “Feng, I’ve decided!”

Feng Yue had just gone to the bathroom and returned when he heard Shen Huayun calling him. He quickly tightened his belt and ran over.

Feng Yue took a few steps, his breath unsteady, and stood beside Shen Huayun. He asked confusedly: “Mr. Shen, I’m here. What’s the matter? Please say.”

“Feng, I’ve decided. After all, beating people is wrong. Especially since this Su Nantian beat Shen Fei and put him in the hospital, with his life uncertain. That’s even more reckless!” Shen Huayun changed his tone to be righteous and resolute, emphasizing the word “reckless” with a trembling body. He looked like a righteous father seeking justice for his son.

Su Nantian’s lips twitched, and he silently sighed, thinking that Shen Huayun was really the same as Shen Fei. His personality and methods were exactly the same.

Indeed, what kind of father produces what kind of son.

At this point, Shen Huayun continued: “But since Su Nantian is still a child, I originally wanted to talk to him properly. But now his attitude is really heartbreaking!”

Feng Yue was confused. He looked at Su Nantian sitting calmly on the chair and immediately understood.

“This child fought with Shen Fei, and his attitude is so stubborn. If I don’t discipline him, he might cause big trouble in the future!” Shen Huayun’s eyes were wide with anger. When he turned to look at Feng Yue, even Feng Yue was startled.

“Feng, this Su Nantian must be taken away and punished severely today!” Shen Huayun said without hesitation to Feng Yue.

Originally, the Patrol Team was brought by Shen Huayun with money from the Patrol Team. He wanted to severely punish this Su Nantian. Feng Yue was also a bit troubled, as he had no real business before and just happened to be called by Shen Huayun who was angry about Shen Fei fighting with a student. He wanted the Patrol Team to catch him.

Feng Yue had been happy at the time, thinking he could climb onto the Shen family’s ladder. So he didn’t even ask clearly what had happened and immediately led his team to follow Shen Huayun to the school.

When he saw Su Nantian, Feng Yue wiped his forehead in cold sweat. He knew that Su Nantian’s background was the Lin family.

Feng Yue was now in a dilemma, originally he had planned to climb onto the Shen family. But who would have thought that Shen Huayun wanted to catch Su Nantian, and Su Nantian had a deep relationship with the Lin family.

Feng Yue secretly regretted not asking clearly before coming.

But there was no such thing as a后悔药 (regret medicine) in the world.

Su Nantian definitely couldn’t be caught.

And Shen family he couldn’t offend either.

Chapter 167: Catch Him

Feng Yue thought more and more, his eyebrows tightly furrowed, and his face showed a hint of impatience.

More impatient was Feng Yue’s side Shen Huayun.

Shen Huayun saw Feng Yue hesitating to act, just thinking about something in place. His face became very difficult.

After doing business for decades on the market, Shen Huayun naturally understood that Feng Yue was comparing the Shen family with the Lin family now. That’s why he didn’t act.

Shen Huayun felt it couldn’t be left alone, so he urged: “Feng, did you hear what I said?”

Feng Yue was amused. He nodded at Shen Huayun, but still didn’t give the order.

This time, even Zhang Xue was anxious.

Zhang Xue had always disliked Su Nantian. Every time they met, they inevitably clashed. She felt uncomfortable every time she saw Su Nantian.

Therefore, the more they met, the more resentment Zhang Xue had towards Su Nantian.

Although there was a turning point between them, it didn’t change the fact that Su Nantian was a pervert.
