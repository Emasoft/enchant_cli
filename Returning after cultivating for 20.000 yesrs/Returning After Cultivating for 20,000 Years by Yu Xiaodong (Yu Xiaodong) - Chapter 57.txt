Softly recounting his story of a broken heart, even Li Zhan and others couldn't help but turn their heads, listening intently.
They were genuinely curious about what tale Su Nantian would spin.
"Here's how it went—I proposed to my goddess before boarding the plane!"
"Was he rejected?" The flight attendant guessed, as two more joined them, their delicate faces tense with anticipation.
In truth, flight attendants weren't necessarily beautiful, but they were undeniably well-proportioned and approachable. With their meticulous makeup and careful grooming, they naturally exuded an air of charm.
Though Su Nantian hadn't expected much, being surrounded by so many girls still filled him with a sense of happiness.
"He didn't reject me, but she set a condition," Su Nantian continued, drawing questions from the surrounding attendants.
"What was the condition? Buying a house? A car?"
"Maybe 180㎡, 180cm, 180mm? Could your hardware be lacking?"
...
Su Nantian chuckled, nearly losing control. He'd wondered if he was being too crude, but these girls were clearly seasoned veterans.
"His goddess told me to urinate and check myself..."
Upon hearing this, the flight attendants all erupted in outrage. After all, he was a handsome young man!
How could such an evil woman exist? Why not give her to us instead!
"Uh... maybe he was joking. After all, you're so handsome—how could that be? Show some effort, and there might still be a chance."
Though they felt it was a waste of resources, the attendants were kind-hearted and offered comfort.
"It's impossible... no chance left."
Su Nantian replied with a faint smile, his face etched with sorrow, the air around him tinged with loneliness.
"Uh... why?"
"I accidentally urinated on her leg..."
( oΔo )！
(？ д？)！
∑(°Д°)！
Three flight attendants, three bewildered faces—this was truly an unexpected twist.
Meanwhile, Li Zhan and others who had been eavesdropping, along with nearby passengers, all burst into laughter. The cabin's atmosphere was suddenly lively.
"Ugh, so annoying..."
Though many envied the flight attendants' job, upon reflection it was quite arduous. Working in a cheerful atmosphere was naturally everyone's wish.
Throughout the journey, Su Nantian kept joking with the attendants, drawing countless envious glances.
Though those who could afford first class might easily find a flight attendant to accompany them at night, it was entirely different from having someone actively circle around you.
As men, they naturally felt envy and resentment.
The cabin remained filled with laughter until they reached Kyoto Airport, where the three attendants still lingered longingly after Su Nantian disembarked.
They watched him vanish into the crowd at the airport.
"Alright, stop staring—he's already far away. All of you little flirtatious girls, did you pass him notes?"
"Don't get too attached. Who among those who can afford first class would look down on us?"
The speaker was the flight attendant supervisor. Though her words were harsh, they were true. She had always been kind to these young women.
The Kyoto Dragon Group, also known as the National Security Bureau's Sixth Division, was responsible for domestic counter-terrorism.
Su Nantian had initially assumed this prestigious organization would be located in a secret military base in Kyoto, surrounded by sentries and barbed wire...
But when he finally arrived at the Dragon Group's base, he realized his assumptions were all wrong. The Kyoto Dragon Group was actually situated in a remote small port on the outskirts of the city.
As an inland city, Kyoto's reason for having a harbor was unclear—connected to a small river that appeared shallow.
Yet, the surrounding area had numerous dilapidated warehouses, and the Dragon Group was housed within one of these.
When Zhang An pointed to this run-down warehouse and told Su Nantian it was the Dragon Group, he even doubted if these people were gangsters and had captured him for experiments.
"Hey, Zhang Ge, back already? Had a good time?"
As they approached the door, a lazy voice suddenly spoke from beside them.
Su Nantian furrowed his brow slightly. Though Zhang An's cultivation level was higher, in terms of combat power, Su Nantian was likely the strongest. Yet he hadn't sensed anyone nearby!
This was quite unexpected—someone had stealthily lurked within two meters of him. Though it didn't mean they could silently take his life, it still startled Su Nantian a bit.
He turned and scrutinized the man. Dressed in an old pair of jeans, with blue work pants and a greasy appearance, he looked like a worker from this dilapidated warehouse. There were no obvious flaws.
Yet Su Nantian sensed a presence from him, though it wasn't the aura of a cultivator. Still, he was definitely not an ordinary person.
Seeing Su Nantian's scrutiny, the man also eyed him suspiciously—after all, this was the Dragon Group headquarters. Not just anyone could enter, and those who reached this door were never ordinary.
"Fair enough. There was a problem with the shipment."
Zhang En replied to the man, his words carrying coded meaning. After all, they were still outside, and caution was necessary.
Though Su Nantian didn't understand their conversation, he could guess it involved trivial matters.
Meanwhile, Zhu Jie quietly introduced the man to Su Nantian:
Liu San'er, an ability user.
His abilities weren't particularly remarkable—his only power was reducing his own presence, making it easy for even a high-level cultivator to overlook him.
Thus, Liu San'er had mastered assassination skills. Not only was he an ability user but also a formidable martial artist and killer.
Today, his presence here likely meant he was on duty—standing guard.
Of course, on the surface, he appeared as a worker in this warehouse, slacking off.
Su Nantian nodded, understanding, and glanced at Liu San'er again without saying much. He had heard of ability users before but hadn't taken them seriously. Now, he realized he'd underestimated the world.

Chapter 273: Du Changwei and Old Tang
Zhang An didn't linger with Liu San'er, leading Su Nantian and others into the factory. Inside were various machines—presses, lathes—all present, with workers bustling about.
These people were the Dragon Group's outer members, knowing little and working daily to mask the group's existence.
After several turns, Zhang An led them to a restroom that ordinary people would find hard to locate.
Then, he opened a hidden door in the last stall wall, revealing a downward passage. The true Dragon Group headquarters lay beneath.
Walking along the corridor, they reached an underground hall. It was brightly lit, resembling a gym with various equipment—though the devices were far beyond ordinary use. For instance, arm exercisers weighing hundreds of pounds and dumbbells the size of wheels.
Zhang An led Su Nantian to a corner rest area, letting him sit and rest while he and Zhu Jie, Li Zhan, etc., went to report.
Though Su Nantian disliked strict rules, he still wanted to work for the Dragon Group and obtain treasures. So he didn't object.
At that moment, three or four people were gathered nearby, discussing loudly about something—though their voices weren't quiet, Su Nantian had no interest in eavesdropping.
He sat down, pondering his next steps.
Su Yu Jian was a major part of his strength, accounting for about half of it. Though the original body had Fuyun Sword and the Twelve Heaven-Shaking Demon Swords Array, its power was undeniable. Yet this didn't mean Su Yu Jian was weak—on the contrary, if compared carefully, Su Yu Jian's strength might be slightly stronger than Su Nantian's.
Their combat experience was similar, as they shared the same consciousness. The original body had Fuyun Sword, and Su Yu Jian also possessed the Six-Faced Han Sword.
After being nurtured by faith power and collecting people's greed and delusion, the Six-Faced Han Sword was an instrument of karmic burden. Its power in battle was no less than Fuyun Sword, and perhaps even stronger.
The original body had the Twelve Heaven-Shaking Demon Swords Array, which would be invincible if completed. Unfortunately, it currently had only twelve sword glows and no sword body—just an empty shell. Though it had some power, it wasn't absurdly strong.
Meanwhile, a golden-armored general had been refined in Su Yu Jian's presence. Its physical strength alone equaled that of a high-level cultivator! Though it lagged in arts and spiritual awareness, it was still quite effective. Its growth potential was immense.
Overall, their strengths were comparable, and since they were family members, there was no need to compare.
That golden-armored general had once been Su Nantian's own stolen ancestor corpse from the Hezhou Wu family.
Now refined into a golden-armored general, it was merely somewhat dull and foolish—like an idiot.
Originally, the Hezhou ancestor had erased its entire consciousness and instincts.
For Su Yu Jian, this was both good and bad. The advantage was easier control and refinement, with loyalty after growth.
The downside was that to imbue this golden-armored general with spiritual awareness, it would take time and massive faith power.
While Su Nantian waited in the rest area, Zhang An and Li Zhan, Zhu Jie, etc., had already gone to the National Security Bureau's office.
It was a small room about ten square meters, appearing ordinary. Since it was underground with no windows, the lighting was sufficient and somewhat bright.
A middle-aged man in his forties sat behind a desk, with some gray hair and wearing gold-rimmed glasses. His head was balding, his belly slightly protruding, and a thermos with goji berries sat on the desk. He looked like an ordinary, unremarkable local government official—perhaps even a greasy middle-aged man.
But this greasy middle-aged man had an impressive name: Du Changwei! Though he lacked a military rank, those who knew him called him "General Du."
Deputy head of the National Security Bureau's Sixth Division, a man with no power but feared as terrifying.
He was the most powerful in the National Security Bureau's Sixth Division, while the actual head was said to be a high-level cultivator who had been in seclusion for years and no one had seen.
At that moment, Du Changwei sat behind his desk, holding a newspaper and reading it with glasses. He occasionally sipped goji berry tea from the desk.
"Knock knock!"
"Come in!"
Seeing Zhang An, Li Zhan, and Zhu Jie enter, Du Changwei's eyes flickered with confusion—why had these people gathered together?
"What's going on with you?"
Du Changwei's voice wasn't harsh or fierce; instead, it was soft and weak, giving the first impression of lacking power.
Yet even Zhang An, who feared nothing, was cautious before this ordinary middle-aged man.
"You seem to have something happened. What is it? Tell me."
The three exchanged glances, not daring to hide anything. Zhu Jie, the most eloquent, began recounting what had happened, avoiding any subjective thoughts and strictly narrating facts.
As Zhu Jie spoke, Du Changwei didn't interrupt, his fingers tapping rhythmically as he thought.
When Zhu Jie finished, Du Changwei asked: "What's Su Nantian's strength? Is he a high-level cultivator?"
Hearing Du Changwei's question, Zhang An paused thoughtfully before shaking his head.
"I don't know. During our fight, I didn't feel the pressure of a high-level cultivator.
But even if a high-level cultivator fought me, he wouldn't win so easily—perhaps not even moving from his seat."
Hearing Zhang An's summary, Du Changwei's eyes flashed with sharpness, as if he had already made up his mind.
"Let him in—he's outside. I want to see him.
He wants to join the Dragon Group? Let him join then. It's safer keeping such a strong person within than outside.
If he truly becomes our ally, that would be ideal."
The others nodded in agreement. They really had no other options regarding Su Nantian.

Chapter 274: Joining the Dragon Group
Was it really necessary to summon a high-level cultivator for such trivial matters?
While Zhang An and others went to Du Changwei's office, Su Nantian sat alone in the rest area, drawing attention.
"Hey, kid, a new recruit?"
A hand slapped Su Nantian's shoulder. His body instinctively trembled, trying to dodge but stopping.
Feeling the power of the slap, it wasn't too strong—there was a testing tone.
Turning around, he saw an older man in his thirties with stubble and a rugged appearance. This look was currently popular, especially among 00s girls. No one knew when it started, but girls liked older men while boys preferred younger women...
It was truly a world gone bad.
Su Nantian's thoughts drifted slightly, nodding and saying to the older man: "Hello, I'm Su Nantian. I came for registration and testing. Please take care of me."
Being able to withstand his slap made the older man regard him with surprise. And since he was polite and well-behaved, there was nothing to say.
"Good to know. No one in the Dragon Group would dare not give me Old Tang some respect! If anyone bullies you, just say my name."
Su Nantian nodded in agreement. Though he felt a bit awkward, he had some fondness for this older man.
He could see that this was a kind and cheerful older man, a good person.
At that moment, the older man held two identical drinks and tossed one to Su Nantian. They clinked glasses, sharing a moment of默契 (mutual understanding).
But the people around Su Nantian saw him drink without hesitation, all smirking and watching his reaction.
In their view, this new recruit had poor discipline—drinking anything without question!
Old Tang's surname was Tang Sanfeng, a martial artist who claimed to be from the Shuzhong Tang Clan.
But this "Shuzhong Tang Clan" was fictional, with no records in the Dragon Group. Thus, those clan members dismissed his claims as nonsense.
Yet one thing was worth noting: though Old Tang looked kind and like a rough man, his skills were as legendary as the Tang Clan.
His specialties included throwing weapons, lightness, and poison—none in the Dragon Group dared claim superiority over him.
Even those who had mocked him before were all poisoned and punished by him.
Thus, Old Tang held a similar status to Du Changwei in the Dragon Group—both were people no one dared provoke, though one was a hero and the other a nuisance.
Su Nantian felt no issues and knew that ordinary poisons couldn't escape his detection.
Old Tang's first impression was a good person, upright and honest.
Though his strength seemed lacking, it wasn't an issue for Su Nantian—his mind had countless techniques. Any one would suffice to elevate Old Tang's strength.
At present, he was no more than thirty-something, still in his prime—perfect for changing cultivation techniques.
Su Nantian, who lacked a personal force, was considering recruiting Old Tang as his subordinate.
When Zhang An came out to call Su Nantian, he found him sitting and chatting with Old Tang. His mouth twitched slightly—these two weren't good people, yet they had gotten along so well. That was impressive.
"Su Nantian, come with me for testing!" Hearing Zhang An's call, Su Nantian said goodbye to Old Tang. He felt this new friend was truly good.
Seeing Su Nantian leave without a care, Old Tang sat alone, his face bewildered. Had his poison failed? Why hadn't this man shown any issues?
Curiously, he took a sip of Su Nantian's drink and licked his lips...
"Wow!"
Su Nantian was unaware of what Old Tang had experienced. At that moment, he was undergoing tests with Zhang An.
Meanwhile, Zhu Jie and Li Zhan waited in the office for Du Changwei's lecture.
"General Du, Su Nantian is mysterious and his background unclear. Why let him join the Dragon Group?"
Hearing Zhu Jie's question, Du Changwei was puzzled. He looked at him and asked: "Do you think he's a spy from abroad?"
Zhu Jie shook his head. Though he didn't find Su Nantian trustworthy, he definitely wasn't a spy from abroad.
After all, foreign cultivation traditions were scarce, and such strength wouldn't be sent as a spy.
Moreover, spies were usually low-key—how many would act so recklessly like Su Nantian?
"Since he's not a spy, and the Dragon Group is short-handed, why not let him join?"
"Regardless of where his strength comes from, if it can be used for us, that's a good thing."
Hearing Du Changwei's words, Zhu Jie nodded. Yet he still felt something was off—this Su Nantian just didn't seem like someone who could work quietly.
"Previously, there was no one to handle the Liaoning vampire incident. Now he's here—let him go! After this event, we can fully assess his strength and whether it can be used for us!"
Zhu Jie nodded, leaving to assign Su Nantian a task. The Liaoning vampire incident had dragged on for too long, and the Dragon Group was in a desperate shortage of personnel. Few could be sent on missions.
If Su Nantian joined, he could serve as a top-tier force, significantly easing the current situation."
Su Nantian was unaware he had already been assigned a task. At that moment, he was undergoing test after test with Zhang An. These tests weren't particularly strange—similar to regular hospital checks.
After all, cultivation methods were hard to detect with scientific instruments, and prying into others' privacy could cause negative emotions.
After a simple assessment, Su Nantian received an ID card and a set of black business suits. From then on, he was officially part of the Dragon Group.
"That's Zhang An—now we're family, right? Do you know where the Dragon Group's warehouse is? Let me see it?"
"..."

Chapter 275: The Evil God Statue
Su Nantian's direct request to see the organization's secrets left Zhang An with no choice.
But he still reported it to Du Changwei. Upon hearing Su Nantian's words, Du Changwei was surprised, then smiled.
If this person had desires, it was great. A person with no desires could not be controlled—if he were selfless and dedicated to the public, Du Changwei would even hesitate to use him.
He signed a document painlessly, allowing Su Nantian to take one item from the warehouse. He could choose anything, but only one.
Honestly, Zhang An and others knew what was in the warehouse, but no one had much interest.
Called a "warehouse," it was actually a shelter housing most items collected from various mission targets—materials prepared by evil cultivators, a werewolf's fangs, relics of destroyed cults... in short, strange supernatural items. Real treasures were not many.
These items were all over the place—just a mess.
Because they were kept outside, it could easily cause various issues, so the Dragon Group collected them here. But they had no good way to handle it.
Those that could be destroyed were already destroyed, while these were not easily destroyed or still had some value.
Su Nantian arrived at the warehouse with Du Changwei's document, opening the door to see dust swirling in the air. His lips twitched.
Was the Dragon Group really a makeshift operation? How poor were they?
The base was built in this run-down factory—no problem. Even the organization's treasure vault, just a rented container nearby—it was too absurd!
Knowing that Beijing's real estate was expensive and land scarce, had the rising housing prices affected so deeply?
But吐槽 (complaining) aside, upon closer inspection, there were indeed some good items.
Jiang Ci surveyed the area and saw a dark purple object radiating endless bloodstained aura.
"Wow, is this the Blood River Chariot?"
Its color and stench suggested high quality! A high-quality Blood River Chariot was a treasure sought after by evil cultivators. It could be refined into a talisman, with great power and ability to enhance cultivation.
The Blood River Chariot referred to the placenta, human placenta refined through countless times.
In hell there is an endless blood sea; to cross it, one needs a Blood River Chariot...
This large piece must have凝聚 (gathered) the blood of countless pregnant women, causing harm to innocent lives.
Refining a Blood River Chariot wasn't just talk—it required opening the abdomen of a pregnant woman before birth, consuming her and the baby's blood.
Though Su Nantian didn't consider himself a good person, this chariot was too evil for him.
Unexpectedly, the Dragon Group had such an item. Jiang Ci knew it was a captured trophy but still glanced at Zhang An with strange eyes.
The reason they kept this Blood River Chariot instead of destroying it was likely to utilize its medicinal value. If properly processed, it could be the strongest recovery medicine—life-saving in emergencies!
Shaking his head, Su Nantian had no interest. He continued deeper and noticed a golden statue.
Continuing further, a golden statue caught Su Nantian's attention.
The statue wasn't large—about twenty to thirty centimeters high, with a fierce and terrifying appearance.
From its design, it was likely a deity worshipped by ethnic minorities in the southern ten thousand mountains. To adapt to modern times and ethnic characteristics, these deities had become increasingly kind and imposing.
This fierce and terrifying statue was likely old.
The golden statue seemed to be made of real gold, but Su Nantian knew it wasn't. It was likely an alloy with a golden coating.
Moreover, he could sense significant faith power凝聚 (gathered) on it. Though this faith power wasn't pure, most of it was negative emotions like fear, anger, and hatred. Still, it proved this statue had been worshipped by countless people.
Seeing Su Nantian's interest in the statue, Zhang An introduced it:
"This thing is called Tuna God, from a remote mountain ethnic group.
It was their tribe's ancestral guardian deity, representing infinite power and absolute rule.
Each generation of chieftains led their people in continuous worship, using human sacrifices.
Initially, they maintained primitive habits. However, one day a tourist accidentally got lost in the mountains and stumbled upon their tribe.
He was quite clever, using his eloquence to convince the chieftain to escape the mountains and use this Tuna God's power to rule the country.
Later, I personally eliminated them. Now most of this tribe has integrated into ordinary life.
This thing is my trophy. After human sacrifices, it can enhance the sacrificer's physical strength and recovery speed, with no side effects. It's a powerful item."
From Zhang An's tone, it was clear he highly valued this statue. After all, reaching this level required much effort, and using it only needed a few human sacrifices—no other things needed.
Hearing Zhang An's words, Su Nantian sneered. "No side effects" was just his wishful thinking!
If sacrificing could gain the deity's response, it meant he had already offered his faith. If he had given up his faith, why would he need other side effects?
Though Su Nantian was dismissive of the statue's power, he still chose it as a target. If there were no other items, this statue was an excellent choice.
Rummaging through the warehouse, there were indeed many good items. Though treasures like spirit stones, spiritual veins, and common cultivation resources weren't present—most had been taken.
But strange items were still numerous, giving Su Nantian much knowledge. Some bizarre things were even unheard of in his two million years of experience.

Chapter 276: The Geng Metal Shensha Sword
After considering everything, Su Nantian ultimately chose the strange statue. Zhang An was somewhat disappointed.
He himself liked this item very much. Though it required human sacrifices, such things weren't worth worrying about.
Even if they didn't kill innocents, there were still enough death row inmates each year. Using the Dragon Group's status and position to get a batch was no problem.
But since this item had been chosen by Su Nantian, Zhang An had nothing to say.
Perhaps in the future, when he wanted to enhance his strength or achieve something, he could borrow it from Su Nantian.
He didn't expect that Su Nantian had chosen this item not to enhance his own strength, but to refine a sword!
At that moment, he only had Fuyun Sword. Fuyun Sword was his life's sword, carrying all his cultivation.
But Su Nantian needed twelve more swords to set up the Twelve Heaven-Shaking Demon Swords Array. Materials that could carry demonic energy were rare. Now, finding such an item in this warehouse was unexpected.
The statue itself was made of gold mixed with some unknown metal, not particularly precious material.
But due to the accumulated faith power on it, its material had changed after being infiltrated by these energies.
Though Su Nantian couldn't name this transformed material, he understood its nature.
It was a metal belonging to the western Geng Metal, carrying the energy of Western Geng Metal. Combined with the abundant mixed faith in it, after Su Nantian's reinforcement, it could be used as a sword body to carry demonic energy.
He asked Zhang An for a secret room and was eager to refine his first Shensha sword!
Though the Twelve Shensha Swords needed all twelve to form the true Twelve Heaven-Shaking Demon Sword Array, even one more could significantly enhance its power.
Zhang An easily fulfilled Su Nantian's request. Though he didn't know what Su Nantian was doing in the secret room, he still arranged it.
However, this secret room had countless hidden cameras.
After arranging everything, Zhang An went to a monitoring room.
At that moment, Du Changwei and Zhu Jie were already watching there.
"What do you think he's doing in the secret room? Is it suicide sacrifice?"
"God damn, how could this person think of such a thing!"
Du Changwei, with his belly, held a teacup. He looked at him with amusement, making him instantly quiet. The others stopped talking and watched silently.
Su Nantian entered the secret room, scanning it with his awareness—hidden cameras were obvious. But since nothing was wrong, he didn't worry about them.
He took out the statue from his storage ring, feeling its accumulated faith power. He smiled—very good.
He snapped his fingers, and a purple flame hovered at his fingertip.
Then he waved his hand, and the purple flame floated under the statue.
In the purple flame, the golden statue seemed to come alive, its fierce god roaring fiercely and glaring at Su Nantian.
But Su Nantian just smirked, ignoring it completely.
As the Xuling Purple Flame continued to burn, the strange statue gradually melted into a pool of golden liquid.
This action made Du Changwei and others watching in the monitoring room frown. He knew this statue was a good item.
In necessary situations, it could supplement the Dragon Group's personnel shortage. Though not a core item, it was no less important.
Even when Su Nantian chose this statue, he had some regret—should have taken it back earlier.
He hadn't expected that this person, after obtaining the statue in just a few minutes, had destroyed it! It was quite unexpected.
Compared to Du Changwei's slight frown, Zhang An's face was much more grim. He remembered clearly that this statue was his trophy. To defeat the tribe's chieftain, he had endured much hardship. Thus, this statue was truly powerful.
Now, such a strong trophy was destroyed by this kid—no wonder he was angry. Though the trophy had been handed over to the Dragon Group, it was still the group's property.
But he was still upset and angry, wanting to confront Su Nantian.
Du Changwei said nothing but Zhu Jie pulled Zhang An back.
"What's the point of confronting him now? The statue is destroyed and can't be recovered. Even if you confront him, will the statue come back?
Not only does it destroy the good relationship we've built, but it also affects General Du's plan.
Moreover, you can't beat him..."
Zhu Jie's words were all nonsense to Zhang An. He had never been inferior to anyone, living freely and independently. Why should he care about others' opinions?
Why did you say so many nonsense words to me? Was it something I needed to consider?
Just say the last sentence and that's it.
Zhu Jie's words were indeed true—since he couldn't beat Su Nantian, his anger quickly subsided. He stood silently, making Du Changwei look at him with surprise.
It was truly unexpected that this rough man could be flexible. It seemed people said Zhang An was lawless, but it wasn't that he couldn't be flexible—just hadn't found someone who could make him bend.
Su Nantian didn't care what the people watching thought, as he was now focused on this sword.
This sword carried Western Geng Metal energy. He refined it into one of the Twelve Heaven-Shaking Demon Swords.
The world has Yin and Yang, Five Elements—plus heaven and earth make the Twelve Heaven-Shaking Demon Swords!
Western Geng Metal energy corresponds to Yang Metal, carrying resentment. It is one of the strongest swords in the Twelve Demon Swords.
