At this moment, Hongye cast a meaningfully profound glance at Xia Guanjia before withdrawing his gaze from him and uttering another cryptic remark.

"Master Hong, I dare not overstep my bounds. I would never harbor ambitions beyond my station. Please discern this clearly," Xia Guanjia replied, his voice trembling despite Hongye's jesting tone. He dared not lift his head, immediately explaining himself in fear that Hongye might interpret his silence as treachery.

"I know you are loyal," Hongye said softly, his words carrying an enigmatic weight.

Hongye would not elaborate to Xia Guanjia. To the onlookers, Xu Xiangning was clearly unloved; no one in the Xu family valued her. Yet Hongye's investigation revealed otherwise.

If Xu Xiangning were truly useless, she would not have returned to the Xu family after committing so many transgressions. She would not be enjoying such a lavish life.

More importantly, since Hongye had formed this ambiguous relationship with Xu Xiangning, the Xu family had subtly aided him. His business and status had ascended to new heights.

These facts indicated that Xu Xiangning was not as dispensable as people believed.

Hongye had built his empire from scratch, surviving through sheer determination. Though he now occupied a high position, every step had been perilous with no background to rely on.

Now that he had Xu Xiangning, it was as if he had clung to the great mountain of the Xu family.

Otherwise, why would Hongye have spent so long entangled with an old woman?

"Xia Guanjia, go and investigate who Su Nantian is. Find out his background."

Hongye quickly snapped back to reality and ordered Xia Guanjia.

"Yes, Master Hong," Xia Guanjia replied. After being reprimanded earlier, he no longer dared to question anything. He obeyed Hongye's orders without hesitation. Whatever Hongye said, he would follow without question.

Though Xia Guanjia had been by Hongye's side for only three years, he understood that speaking little and acting much was the key to survival.

"Go," Hongye waved his hand, signaling Xia Guanjia to leave.

At this moment, Hongye's mind began to ponder Su Nantian. When he heard about the Wu family incident, he had already suspected Xu Xiangning would seek his help. Since he could think of it, the Wu family must have as well.

They had not stopped Xu Xiangning from coming to him, which meant they too wanted Hongye to investigate.

Therefore, Hongye would not refuse. On the contrary, he would show his worth.

Only by firmly clinging to this great ship could his career ascend further. Then, others would know the name of Hongye.

Meanwhile, Nan Gong Yuyan had followed her father's instructions to spread the news that Su Nantian was still alive. She executed this with remarkable subtlety, not directly stating that Su Nantian was alive but releasing a surveillance video for people to discover themselves. Then, she would launch an escalation when public opinion reached its peak.

Additionally, Nan Gong Yuyan publicly declared on behalf of the Nan Gong family that they had no connection with Su Nantian. She listed various evidence to prove that Su Nantian had initially used their family to connect with the Wu family, ultimately leading to the Wu family's destruction.

The Nan Gong family positioned themselves as victims and claimed Su Nantian was a secret spy of others. This incident aimed to disrupt the Wu family, with the next target being the Nan Gong family.

Unexpectedly, an error and accident had forced Su Nantian to retreat temporarily. Thus, the Nan Gong family had narrowly escaped.

At present, the most powerful family in inland port was the Nan Gong family. Previously, they had been rivals with the Wu family, but now that the Wu family was eliminated by an unknown Su Nantian, no one dared to oppose the Nan Gong family.

Even if some people thought the Nan Gong family's statement was biased, no one would be foolish enough to say so. Instead, people were quite tactful in greeting the Nan Gong family and sending gifts for reassurance.

It seemed they truly accepted the Nan Gong family's claim of being victims. They also strongly condemned Su Nantian, shifting all blame onto him.

This time, the blame was distributed quite skillfully.

After completing these actions, Nan Gong Yuyan saw the feedback and immediately reported back to her father.

"Father, I have followed your instructions and spread everything. Public opinion is now clearly in our favor. A few unwise cats have been dealt with by me."

Nan Gong Yuyan reported softly to her father, ensuring all problems were isolated and no one would dare to interfere.

She had also enlisted reliable people for 24-hour real-time monitoring, ensuring any negative public opinion would be eliminated immediately to prevent complications.

After thinking about this, Nan Gong Yuyan smiled again and continued speaking: "Father, I told you. If we shift all the blame onto Su Nantian, this incident can be completely separated from us."

Nan Gong Yuyan continued her report, pausing before adding: "Even if we cannot completely shift 100% of the blame, shifting four-fifths onto Su Nantian would make him a target for everyone's anger when he reappears."

At that time, Su Nantian would be a rat in the street, never able to move freely.

When Nan Gong Yuyan said this, she paused and her expression turned serious. At least, the first anger Su Nantian would face would be from the Nan Gong family!

Nan Gong Yuyan remembered she had specifically warned Su Nantian before. If he did anything to harm the Nan Gong family or damage their interests, she would never forgive him.

Since Su Nantian had failed to keep his promise and placed the Nan Gong family in the most dangerous position, she would not show mercy.

When Su Nantian reappeared, Nan Gong Yuyan would definitely not let him go!

After thinking about this, Nan Gong Yuyan looked up again at her father. "Father, I will handle this matter myself. I will keep a close watch on the situation and report any developments immediately."

Nan Gong Yuyan said earnestly, striving to impress her father and gain his approval.

This was the perfect opportunity to show off, letting her father know which of their children was truly useful. It would also let her father see that a tiger's daughter could surpass her father.

"Ah, you did well with this matter," Nan Gong Lin nodded in satisfaction upon hearing this. He then said to Nan Gong Yuyan, "I know you are the smartest. Entrusting this matter to you is the most secure choice."

"I believe you won't disappoint me," Nan Gong Lin added, his gaze filled with satisfaction. He was very pleased with Nan Gong Yuyan's efficiency and admired her.

"Father, rest assured! I will handle this properly and not disappoint you!" After receiving Nan Gong Lin's praise, Nan Gong Yuyan smiled involuntarily. She was only in her early twenties, the age when one yearns for a father's approval. Now that she knew she had performed well and heard her father praise her, her mood was good, and her smile could hardly be concealed.

But soon, Nan Gong Yuyan's happiness could not last. The next moment she heard her father's words, her smile gradually disappeared.

"Ayin, go and call your brother over. I have something to discuss with him," Nan Gong Lin said at this moment.

"Yes, Father."

Nan Gong Yuyan's smile gradually froze when she heard her father say this. Her fingers slowly clenched, and her palm tightly gripped, with her nails digging into her palm. Yet Nan Gong Yuyan seemed to feel no pain. Despite the turmoil within, her face showed no expression.

Chapter 771: Heart Full of Resentment

"I'll go and call my brother over," she said, though her dissatisfaction was evident. Yet she managed to smile at Nan Gong Lin.

Nan Gong Yuyan concealed her feelings very well, even before Nan Gong Lin, revealing no hint of problems.

"Ah, go," Nan Gong Lin did not notice Nan Gong Yuyan's change. He nodded and signaled her to leave.

"Yes, Father."

Nan Gong Yuyan replied with a smile again. Her face showed no emotion at all. She smiled as she slowly exited, closing the door gently.

But just after leaving the room, Nan Gong Yuyan's smile completely disappeared. Her face darkened immediately.

Again! Nan Gong Yuyan thought angrily in her heart, her expression full of resentment. Her tightly clenched hands gripped even tighter.

She had known this would happen! She should have anticipated it!

Even if she did everything perfectly, even if she handled all matters well or was more outstanding than Nan Gong Ping, her father still favored Nan Gong Ping. It felt as if all her efforts were for others' benefit.

Why was there so much injustice just because of their different genders?

Was it really such a big issue for men or women to inherit the family?

In truth, it was all Nan Gong Lin's own inner bias!

At this point, Nan Gong Yuyan's expression became even more serious. Her face was worse than before, and her mood plummeted to the bottom.

If Nan Gong Ping were smarter or more talented, she would accept it. It wasn't that she intentionally belittled her brother; he was truly mediocre, with no highlights at all.

At this thought, Nan Gong Yuyan again glared at her father's room. But she had more resentment now, only to obediently go and deliver the message.

After all, at this stage, she still couldn't let her father see her true thoughts.

Soon, Nan Gong Yuyan delivered her father's message to her brother.

"Father said you wanted to see me," Nan Gong Ping arrived at Nan Gong Lin's room quickly. He first greeted Nan Gong Lin, then looked up with confusion, unsure why his father had called him so urgently.

"What do you need me to do, Father?" Nan Gong Ping asked respectfully, waiting patiently for his father's words.

"What else? It's still the wetland bidding issue," Nan Gong Lin said after a moment of contemplation, sighing before speaking: "We had previously made an agreement with the Wu family and reached a cooperation with Wu Chuan. We would take over this project first, then divide the profits."

But an unexpected problem had occurred.

Fortunately, the wetland bidding was postponed because of this major event. Otherwise, their Nan Gong family would have suffered even greater losses. Even so, Nan Gong Lin's concerns could not be relaxed.

If Wu Chuan had died after winning the bid, it would have been better. They wouldn't need to worry about profit division afterward and could save a lot of trouble.

Moreover, it would have been entirely beneficial for the Nan Gong family at that time.

But unfortunately, despite all their calculations, this problem had still occurred. Wu Chuan's death had added many troubles for them.

However, Su Nantian's actions had also provided them with some leverage. It allowed them to relax and no longer constantly fear Wu Chuan.

"Even now that we can't cooperate with Wu Chuan, we must still get this land," Nan Gong Lin said after a moment of contemplation. He analyzed the situation and then ordered Nan Gong Ping.

This was crucial for their family's future development. It could not afford any mistakes.

Nan Gong Lin had never anticipated Wu Chuan's death, nor did he expect him to die at such an important time.

But on the other hand, this had also eliminated a powerful rival for their Nan Gong family.

"Father, rest assured. Now放眼望去, there's no one in the inland port who can match our Nan Gong family. This land is already ours," Nan Gong Ping said confidently, answering his father.

Indeed, after the Wu family's downfall, there was no one left in the inland port who could oppose them. So they didn't need to worry about this at all.

"Ping'er, it's not as simple as you imagine," Nan Gong Lin interrupted Nan Gong Ping at this moment. He thought his son was still too young.

Now, the public's speculation about their Nan Gong family was varied. This added a layer of pressure. If handled well, it would be like adding wings to a tiger; if not, it could lead to a deep abyss.

At this thought, Nan Gong Lin looked up at Nan Gong Ping again and instructed: "This matter was entrusted to you before. Now it's still your responsibility. Remember, no matter what means you use, this land must be ours. It cannot fall into others' hands."

Now that the Wu family was defeated, once they secured this land, their position as the top in the inland port would be unshakable. Then they could solidify this position.

As for how the other families would compete and fight, it was no longer Nan Gong Lin's concern.

"Remember, this matter must not have any mistakes," Nan Gong Lin added after saying these important points.

After saying that, Nan Gong Lin continued: "Also, this is still your test. Remember to grasp it well and don't disappoint me."

The "test" Nan Gong Lin referred to was whether Nan Gong Ping could succeed as the head of the Nan Gong family.

"Yes! Father! I will do my best and not disappoint you!" After hearing this, Nan Gong Ping immediately nodded and pledged with a firm heart.

This matter was so important that even if Nan Gong Lin hadn't said it, Nan Gong Ping would have paid a million attentions. He couldn't afford any mistakes.

"Ah, good. I believe in you," Nan Gong Lin nodded in satisfaction upon hearing this. He then gave some more instructions to Nan Gong Ping before waving him away.

After Nan Gong Ping left, Nan Gong Lin's expression gradually darkened. His mood was still unsettled.

He thought that another storm might soon begin.

But who would fail and who would remain was still an unknown.

Chapter 772: Provoking the Tyrant

In this small fishing village, Su Nantian continued his peaceful life. He treated villagers' illnesses, selected herbal remedies, and led them to identify medicinal herbs on the mountain.

Every evening, Su Nantian would go alone to the back mountain to meditate and absorb the essence of the sun and moon.

In truth, Su Nantian didn't know what purpose this served. But his body naturally performed this action. He felt that doing this every day made him feel comfortable and energetic, with no signs of fatigue.

Su Nantian closed his eyes in meditation. He was unaware that every time he meditated, a faint spiritual power surrounded him. This was the unique spiritual energy of this small fishing village.

Su Nantian also didn't notice that these spiritual energies circled around him daily, nourishing his body and soul.

These past days, Su Nantian had regularly gone to Chen to change medicine. Every time he saw Chen's wound, his heart would beat rapidly.

Su Nantian knew this was because his cells were screaming to settle accounts with these bullies.

Su Nantian remembered Uncle Wang's words: don't provoke these bullies or start trouble. But Su Nantian had already made up his mind.

He could avoid starting trouble, but he could appear confidently before them. When they attacked him, he would fight back—this wouldn't count as provoking.

After thinking about this, Su Nantian quickly made a plan in his mind.

That day, Su Nantian went as usual to change medicine for Chen.

While changing the medicine, he casually asked: "Does your wound still hurt?"

"No, Uncle Wang. With your medicine, I feel much better," Chen shook his head and smiled at Su Nantian. He was extremely grateful to him.

"Why did you encounter these bullies that day?" Su Nantian asked, slightly relieved and continued.

Chen didn't know Su Nantian's thoughts. He didn't think further, and when he heard Su Nantian ask this, he truthfully told him. He also mentioned where he had met those bullies and spoke without any caution.

While comforting and reassuring Chen, Su Nantian also noted down that location.

"Uncle Wang, you don't know! These bullies are lawless people. They act recklessly and have no fear of anything. Moreover, they're very cunning! They always target people who are alone!"

Chen continued to say: "Especially when they encounter girls, the bullies become even more extreme. So the women in our small fishing village dare not go out alone, and even when they go out in groups, they don't dare to go out freely!"

When Chen said this, he became indignant again. He found these bullies extremely despicable.

"How could there be such people? They're not human!" Su Nantian also agreed with Chen, jointly condemning these bullies.

Meanwhile, Su Nantian had already noted down that location.

Was it this small hill? And they specifically targeted people who were alone?

After thinking through, Su Nantian gradually had a plan in his mind.

"Chen, rest well. If you have any problems, come to Uncle Wang anytime," Su Nantian said after getting the information he wanted. He didn't stay with Chen but quickly returned.

He took advantage of Uncle Wang and Xiao Wang going out to fish. He tidied up quickly and prepared to go to that small hill.

Su Nantian had already made a decision. He must thoroughly deal with these bullies, so they would no longer dare to target the villagers of the small fishing village.

At this thought, Su Nantian slowly smiled. He was suddenly eager to see what kind of people these bullies were, daring to be so arrogant.

Su Nantian also hoped they would still be able to laugh when they saw him!

After thinking about this, Su Nantian simply tidied up and set off for that small hill.

Perhaps the timing of Su Nantian's appearance was just right. He had barely reached that small hill when he was immediately stopped.

"Who are you?" Su Nantian raised his eyebrows and asked softly, pretending not to know their identities.

"We are who? Heh! You're a kid with some nerve. Don't you know our rules here?"

Surrounding Su Nantian were seven or eight young men in their twenties. They didn't have any strange appearances, but they looked a bit careless and had very sinister eyes, clearly not upright people.

The leader was a relatively younger person. His tone was extremely arrogant. Su Nantian observed that these people had a common flaw: when they spoke, they liked to lift their heads as if looking down on others.

In fact, this action was just silly and funny, making people want to laugh when they saw it.

"What rules?" Su Nantian calmly asked back, observing them with his peripheral vision while paying attention to their every move. He was prepared to respond if they made any moves.

"Hey! That's strange. You dare to ask me about the rules? You're not from this area, right? Have you never heard of who we are?"

Hearing Su Nantian's bold question, the other party was also surprised. He looked at Su Nantian from head to toe and then extended his hand: "Now, give us all the money you have! This way, you'll know who we are!"

After saying this, the young man arrogantly lifted his head, looking down on Su Nantian.

Su Nantian continued to play dumb. After hearing this, he thought for a moment and then showed an expression of sudden understanding.

"Oh! You want money? I see. You're beggars, right? Because only beggars would ask people for money!"

Su Nantian said this while putting a few cents he had prepared into the young man's hand: "Here, take it. Although there's not much money, it's my sincere gesture. Take it to buy some food!"

Su Nantian was very polite and generous, but each word was mocking these bullies.

"What? How dare you call us beggars! I think you're tired of living!"

These bullies had never met someone as bold as Su Nantian. Even if some people didn't want to give, they just clung to their money without letting go. No one had dared to provoke them like this before.

Su Nantian was the first!

Chapter 773: Teaching the Bullies a Lesson

"I think you're tired of living!"

These bullies had been bullying in this small fishing village for years. They encountered people who always submitted, never facing any resistance. So today when Su Nantian dared to resist them and spoke arrogantly, they were initially shocked and couldn't react. After regaining their composure, the only thing left was overwhelming anger.

The leader of the young men cursed again. His eyes looked like they wanted to tear Su Nantian apart.

It was the first time in their years of existence that they had met someone as bold as Su Nantian.

"Stupid kid, don't you know who we are? How dare you say such arrogant words!"

One of the bullies glared at Su Nantian fiercely, clearly intending to teach him a lesson.

"I do know. You just said it!"

At this moment, Su Nantian remained calm and took their words. His tone was also very calm, as if he hadn't seen the bullies' overwhelming anger. Or perhaps even if Su Nantian knew, he didn't care.

Because Su Nantian wasn't afraid of these people at all.

"You're just beggars, right? Those who ask for money from others are beggars. There's no other identity."

Su Nantian answered, each word spoken with great force, as if there was no way to refute it.

At the same time, his expression was very serious, proving that these were truly his words.

"You!"

The leader of the young men was stunned. He hadn't expected Su Nantian to say such words again, and he was speechless for a moment.

"I think you're looking for death today! Stupid kid!"

Another man behind the young man finally couldn't bear it. He stepped forward and stood in front of Su Nantian, speaking fiercely: "You're looking for trouble today, right!"

This time, his tone had a bit more certainty.

They had been active here for many years and met many people, so they could immediately tell that Su Nantian was looking for trouble.

"Stupid kid! Looking for trouble, right!"

This man spoke coldly and then suddenly grabbed Su Nantian's collar. He spit on Su Nantian's face while speaking.

"I'll give you one last chance. If you now hand over all your money and then kneel to beg for forgiveness, saying that you're a coward and that you've made a mistake, we'll let you go!"

After saying this, he waited for Su Nantian's actions and then urged him to do it immediately.

"Coarse coward."

At this moment, Su Nantian asked in confusion and looked at the man calmly.

The man nodded immediately without reacting: "Yes! That's right! You're a coward!"

"Ah, good."

Su Nantian quickly replied with this sentence. His expression was even calmer than before.

The man hadn't realized yet, but after thinking about it, he immediately understood what Su Nantian meant.

"You dare to call me a coward?"

He glared at Su Nantian angrily. He had already been very angry, and now being provoked by Su Nantian made him even more furious. He wanted to tear Su Nantian apart.

"No, I didn't call you that. I just asked a question and you answered it yourself. No one forced you."

Su Nantian still replied with that calm tone, and because of his calm attitude, it made them even more angry.

"Good, you're not taking the wine and want to eat punishment!"

This man clenched his fists tightly, speaking with gritted teeth. It was almost forced out between his teeth.

His reaction proved that this man was indeed very angry.

When Su Nantian heard this threat, he didn't show any fear. Instead, he became more composed.

At this moment, Su Nantian spoke softly: "Is that all the old lines you have? Don't you have any fresh ones?"

Su Nantian asked while showing a very calm expression.

Even though they were seven or eight people standing there, and now they were slowly surrounding him because of Su Nantian's provocation, trying to intimidate him with numbers.

But Su Nantian's face showed no signs of tension or fear. It seemed he truly didn't regard them at all and wasn't afraid of them.

When the man heard Su Nantian still dared to reply to him, his fists clenched with a creaking sound. The bones started to collide and make an eerie noise.

"Good, Ah Hao! You're still stubborn at the end. Do you think my words are old-fashioned? I'll show you how old-fashioned my fists are!"

After saying this, the man immediately punched Su Nantian. His target was clearly Su Nantian's face.

He wanted to severely punish Su Nantian and let him know the consequences of offending them!

"Go! Hit him! Show him a lesson!"

The others also showed the expression of watching a show and cheered for their companion.

It was obvious they thought Su Nantian would definitely not be able to dodge this attack.

But in fact, they were about to be disappointed.

Because when the man threw his punch, Su Nantian directly dodged it. Not only was he not hit, but the man didn't even touch a single hair of Su Nantian.

Moreover, when he dodged the man's punch, Su Nantian extended his foot to trip him. The man couldn't stop himself and fell forward, landing on the ground with a big fall.

"Ah Hao, are you okay?"

When the man fell down, his friends immediately shouted and rushed to help Ah Hao up.

At the same time, these people looked at Su Nantian with gradually increasing caution. Their expressions were no longer as calm before.

"Good, it seems you're also a practitioner. That's why you're so arrogant in front of us!"

Another young man helped Ah Hao up. The others just glared at Su Nantian and started to stretch their limbs: "Let's see whether you can fight alone or we seven people can beat you!"

As the saying goes, two fists cannot defeat four hands. They thought even if Su Nantian was a practitioner, he couldn't match their numbers.

If they really fought, Su Nantian would only be beaten!

Chapter 774: Bullies Attack

They also thought that Su Nantian's arrogance was the time to teach him a lesson, so he would know that not everyone could be offended.

At this thought, they continued to stretch their wrists and ankles. They were clearly preparing to attack Su Nantian.

After seeing their actions, Su Nantian quickly guessed their intention. However, he showed no fear at all and even his face didn't change.

Su Nantian smiled happily, waving his hand to them as if challenging a dog. This action was clearly very insulting.

Su Nantian's actions immediately angered these people. They exchanged glances and decided to attack together, trying to stop Su Nantian from being so arrogant.

"Go!"

One of them gave the order. The others nodded and immediately rushed forward, their fists and feet attacking together to beat Su Nantian into a mess.

Unfortunately, they all failed. Facing these seven people, Su Nantian remained calm and showed no signs of tension at all.

Su Nantian caught their fists with his hands, while another foot kicked them away.

In this way, none of them touched Su Nantian, and all were knocked down by him.

"Did you want to teach me a lesson? You're only this good?"

At this moment, Su Nantian mocked again. His lips curled into a faint mockery.

This expression and these words completely provoked these bullies.

"You're only this good. How dare you bully the villagers? I think you're the ones who are tired of living," Su Nantian stretched his wrists slightly, relaxing. He thought he was quite good and even exceeded his expectations.

He had completely forgotten about his past, but Su Nantian just thought he could beat them. So he came to test it.

Unexpectedly, the result was even better than he had imagined. Facing these seven or eight people, Su Nantian remained calm and didn't even feel tired.

On the contrary, these bullies he had knocked down hadn't gotten up yet!

"You!"

One of them pointed at Su Nantian. This was Ah Hao, the one who had first punched Su Nantian. Seeing his brothers attack together but still fail to teach Su Nantian a lesson, and instead being mocked by him.

Ah Hao was now somewhat worried. They had apparently underestimated Su Nantian's abilities.

But these people hadn't suffered any losses before. To be knocked down like this, how could they accept it?

So they got up again, brushed the dirt off their clothes, and made threats: "It was just a mistake. You don't think you're so good, do you? You won't be arrogant for long!"

Ah Hao said this and glared at Su Nantian with that look.

After hearing their arrogant words, Su Nantian didn't expose them. Instead, he smiled and waved his hand at them.

"Is that so?"

Su Nantian provocatively asked softly and said to them: "Then let's go again. Now you must show your real skills, don't say it was just playing around."

When Su Nantian said this, his tone carried a faint mockery and contempt. It was clearly saying that he had already seen through their abilities, and now he wasn't afraid of them at all.

"Hmph! Keep being arrogant!"
