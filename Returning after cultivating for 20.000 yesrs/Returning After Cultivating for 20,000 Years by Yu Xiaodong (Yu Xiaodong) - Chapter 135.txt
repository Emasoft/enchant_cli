“Trouble.”

Su Nantian made a polite remark before following the guide into the room, no longer paying attention to events outside.

The guide remained expressionless throughout the journey, silent and reserved. He spoke only twice: “Come with me” at the beginning and “Please enter” upon arrival. His words were as sparse as his demeanor, embodying an extreme restraint.

“Creak—”

Su Nantian arrived at the designated private room. After the guide turned to leave, he pushed the door open. He had assumed the person waiting for him would be Li, the previous assistant, but instead found Wu Chuan himself seated inside.

Even Su Nantian could not suppress a look of surprise.

“Surprised?”

Wu Chuan chuckled, then rose to greet Su Nantian. His face bore a warm smile, his tone laced with amusement. Yet this smile never reached his eyes—merely a counterfeit expression of politeness.

“Of course, I am surprised. I never expected Mr. Wu Chuan to come in person. What virtue do I possess to be honored with such a visit?”

Su Nantian had already composed his expression, adopting an urgent tone to feign nervousness. He added respectfully: “If Mr. Wu Chuan wished to arrive early, why not inform me beforehand? To have you wait for me is truly improper!”

Su Nantian continued, his tone courteous: “It should be I who welcome you, yet now it is you, a revered elder, waiting for me. This is most disrespectful.”

This exchange elevated Wu Chuan’s dignity to its peak, treating him with utmost respect as if Su Nantian genuinely revered and admired him.

At the same time, Su Nantian wore a bashful expression, his demeanor perfectly measured. Every gesture and word was flawlessly executed, leaving no room for criticism or doubt.

“Haha.”

Wu Chuan smiled at Su Nantian’s words, his gaze deepening. His eyes scrutinized Su Nantian with an enigmatic intensity: “If I told you this was no surprise, would that spoil the moment?”

He added, his tone more deliberate: “After all, it was our Wu family who sought your counsel. You are the guest; I am merely the host awaiting your arrival—this is entirely reasonable.”

Su Nantian nodded in agreement, but inwardly mused about Wu Chuan’s true intentions.

“By the way, I have given you ample time to consider. How do you now feel about it?”

Wu Chuan paused, his gaze lingering on Su Nantian with a calculated intensity. His words carried hidden meanings, making the conversation uncomfortable.

“I have always favored giving juniors opportunities—especially choices. My temperament is also quite amiable, but you must understand: patience and temper are relative. If you cooperate, I shall be patient. However, if you continue to delay and secretly plot against me, even I may no longer be able to maintain this smile.”

Wu Chuan’s final words carried an even deeper implication, his expression now filled with calculated menace. His demeanor clearly conveyed: comply or face consequences.

“Haha, how could that be? Since I agreed to this meeting, I have already decided my answer.”

Su Nantian smiled in agreement before speaking with a slight shift in tone, his face now solemn: “My answer is simple—I am willing to serve your Wu family… no, rather, Mr. Wu Chuan himself.”

After speaking, Su Nantian offered a subtle, meaningful smile, mirroring Wu Chuan’s earlier enigmatic expression.

After the exchange, Su Nantian quickly suppressed his smile and met Wu Chuan’s gaze directly, unflinching. His sincerity was absolute, devoid of deceit.

“Hmph, well done.”

Wu Chuan’s satisfaction was evident in his smile. He approved both Su Nantian’s compliance and the final statement: that he served Wu Chuan personally, not the Wu family.

This declaration was a gesture of utmost sincerity, and it was precisely this that made Wu Chuan’s smile grow more content.

“But Mr. Wu Chuan, after I agree to your demands, what recompense will you offer me?”

Su Nantian waited for Wu Chuan’s smile to deepen before continuing. He paused, then added: “I believe your recompense will be even more generous.”

He raised an eyebrow, locking eyes with Wu Chuan in a deliberate gaze. This time, he did not retreat.

His lips curled into a subtle smile, as if he already knew Wu Chuan would not disappoint him.

“Haha, of course.”

Wu Chuan’s lips curled slightly at Su Nantian’s words. This time, his smile reached his eyes, and his gaze toward Su Nantian was more approving.

Wu Chuan seemed to find Su Nantian’s character quite agreeable, even regretting he had not recruited him earlier.

Chapter 676: Negotiating Important Matters

“Who knew that Old Nanjing had unearthed such a promising talent? Truly, he has stumbled upon a treasure!”

Wu Chuan mused, then suddenly sighed: “Yet it is regrettable. He had the fortune but not the luck—discovering a promising talent, yet ultimately handing it over to another.”

Since Wu Chuan had brought up Nanjing, Su Nantian naturally responded: “In truth, I was not wise enough to choose Mr. Wu Chuan’s path directly. My mistake was aligning with the Nanjing family.”

He paused, then continued: “Nanjing Lin is quite capable—intelligent and skilled. However, he has grown old now, his strength waning. He chose Nanjing Ping as the next patriarch. Since his judgment is flawed, I naturally seek a better path.”

This statement was both an acknowledgment to Wu Chuan and a subtle explanation of why he had abandoned the Nanjing family for Wu Chuan.

Only by blending truth and falsehood could one earn greater credibility—a method Su Nantian often employed.

Indeed, the external suspicion toward the Nanjing family was widespread. Su Nantian’s statement effectively sealed Wu Chuan’s understanding of his motives.

Indeed, after receiving Su Nantian’s answer, Wu Chuan’s smile widened, his eyes now filled with admiration for Su Nantian.

“Hahaha, I was right to trust you. Losing you must have been a great loss for Nanjing Lin!”

Wu Chuan laughed, as if genuinely pleased with Su Nantian.

In truth, Su Nantian was acutely aware of Wu Chuan’s nature. If he had approached Wu Chuan directly from the start, the result would not have been this.

Wu Chuan was notoriously suspicious and cunning. If Su Nantian had entered Wu’s family immediately, he would have been suspect long before any opportunity arose.

That was why Su Nantian had chosen a roundabout path, circumventing obstacles to approach Wu Chuan. Now, the signs indicated his method was correct and wise.

“Then Mr. Wu Chuan, how do you plan to arrange me?”

Su Nantian observed the atmosphere had reached its peak and now needed to voice his request. He deliberately adopted an eager expression, as if genuinely anticipating Wu Chuan’s arrangement.

Wu Chuan’s expression softened slightly before he replied: “The amount previously offered by Li Assistant, increased by one digit.”

Previously, Li Assistant had proposed three million. Increasing it by a digit meant thirty million.

“Mr. Wu Chuan is truly generous!”

Su Nantian could not remain indifferent to Wu Chuan’s gesture. He immediately expressed his gratitude, as if genuinely impressed.

“Haha, don’t rush to thank me. I know you are not swayed by wealth.”

Wu Chuan cast Su Nantian a brief glance before speaking.

Su Nantian immediately interrupted: “Mr. Wu Chuan, that is incorrect! Who in this world does not love wealth? As the saying goes: ‘People die for wealth, birds perish for food.’ Especially people from small places like me.”

At this point, Su Nantian feigned embarrassment, his face showing a slight awkwardness: “It’s just that the price Li Assistant offered did not meet my expectations.”

After speaking, Su Nantian chuckled awkwardly.

“Is that so? You are quite candid.”

Wu Chuan raised an eyebrow, surprised by Su Nantian’s words. His initial assessment of Su Nantian had slightly shifted.

Still, it was better this way. Wu Chuan had previously feared Su Nantian’s independence and potential for rebellion. Now, knowing his weakness, he had a handle on him, making control easier.

Su Nantian noticed Wu Chuan’s shifting gaze and knew he was calculating him. He inwardly smiled, this being the olive branch he had extended to Wu Chuan—hoping he would accept it.

After all, Su Nantian was acutely aware that a sharp sword without a scabbard would still cut its wielder. Thus, others would fear it more.

But by admitting his greed for wealth, Su Nantian had gifted Wu Chuan a scabbard, making it easier to control him. He assumed Wu Chuan had mastered the situation and would thus overlook or underestimate him, making it easier to gain trust.

“Then Li Assistant was at fault.”

Wu Chuan chuckled again, then added: “Of course, this was merely a small gift. The real one comes later.”

At this point, Wu Chuan paused before continuing: “Indeed, this small gift also includes the position of head steward at the Nanjing family. Even if you had not proposed it, it was destined to be yours.”

“What I am about to give you is something else.”

Wu Chuan’s tone was resolute, his expression firm. His gaze instilled trust in those who met it.

“Is that so? I never expected Mr. Wu Chuan to be this generous! You have already given me so much—will there be more surprises for me?”

Su Nantian feigned surprise and eagerness, as if truly captivated by Wu Chuan’s conditions. He seemed desperate to receive the benefits Wu Chuan offered.

Wu Chuan, seeing Su Nantian’s eager gaze, deepened his own eyes slightly. A flicker of satisfaction and pride flashed across them before he spoke: “I do not know your purpose in joining the Nanjing family, nor will I interfere.”

“Mr. Wu Chuan?”

Su Nantian feigned surprise, his expression bewildered: “I am not quite clear on your meaning.”

Wu Chuan waved a hand, saying: “I said I would not interfere. You need not worry so much. After all, our cooperation is a win-win situation—beneficial for both of us.”

He paused before adding generously: “So, I promise you—once we unite to overthrow the Nanjing family, I will leave their people entirely in your hands. No matter how extreme your actions may be, I shall not interfere.”

Chapter 677: Empty Promises

“Mr. Wu Chuan… you!”

Su Nantian feigned a shocked expression, as if deeply moved by Wu Chuan’s generous terms.

His performance was impeccable—neither overly exaggerated nor excessively calm. Wu Chuan’s conditions were indeed eye-catching!

If Su Nantian had not been on a mission, but rather a defector to Nanjing Lin, he would have already been swayed by Wu Chuan’s offer!

This thought made Su Nantian instinctively compare Nanjing Lin and Wu Chuan, realizing Wu Chuan’s meticulousness far surpassed Nanjing Lin’s.

Or perhaps Nanjing Lin had been plagued by illness, losing his former clarity and making poor decisions.

“Rest assured, I have always been truthful.”

Wu Chuan gave Su Nantian a definitive answer, repeating his promise with certainty: “Once you agree, this promise will remain valid forever.”

“Thank you, Mr. Wu Chuan!”

Su Nantian immediately expressed his gratitude, appearing deeply trusting of Wu Chuan. At this point, even a mutual win seemed too much for Su Nantian to bear—he longed to offer his heart to Wu Chuan.

Yet, Su Nantian’s inner thoughts were far from the surface’s fervor. On the contrary, he felt utterly indifferent, even a hint of amusement.

How could Wu Chuan think so little of him? Or perhaps Wu Chuan still viewed him as a provincial.

Su Nantian was no fool. Even if Wu Chuan spoke beautifully, painting grand visions, it was still empty words.

Once his value was drained by Wu Chuan, would he still be as amiable?

Thus, Su Nantian was a fool to believe Wu Chuan’s promises were sincere.

Regardless of their inner thoughts, they maintained a harmonious facade, appearing as if no friction existed between them.

Wu Chuan seemed unconcerned with issuing orders to Su Nantian immediately, or perhaps he had enough leverage over the Nanjing family. Thus, he did not rush Su Nantian into action.

Wu Chuan engaged Su Nantian in casual conversation, praising him and discussing trivial matters—never touching on the Nanjing family’s secrets.

Since Wu Chuan remained silent, Su Nantian did not foolishly reveal his hand. He was content to feign ignorance, as if truly becoming Wu Chuan’s confidant, speaking on topics that were never simple.

It was only when Wu Chuan’s phone rang—Li Assistant calling him to an important meeting—that he reluctantly parted ways with Su Nantian. Even as he left, Wu Chuan clasped Su Nantian’s hand and gave him a heartfelt farewell, as if treating him like a younger relative.

Su Nantian reciprocated with courtesy, expressing concern for Wu Chuan. The atmosphere of the private room grew warm due to their mutual care.

But soon after Wu Chuan left, the room’s atmosphere turned cold instantly, as if the performance had ended and the stage was closing.

Neither Wu Chuan outside nor Su Nantian inside wore their earlier amiable smiles. Instead, they bore cold expressions and blank faces.

They had both worn masks throughout the exchange, concealing their true selves. Neither could discern the other’s genuine thoughts.

“Sir, this Su Nantian is such a minor figure—why did you waste so much time personally meeting him?”

After leaving the room, Li Assistant constantly complained about Su Nantian. On one hand, he genuinely looked down on Su Nantian’s status; on the other, he resented him for not securing a deal himself, forcing Wu Chuan to intervene.

“Simple?”

Wu Chuan raised an eyebrow, his face as if covered in thick ice. Even from three meters away, one could feel the chill of his gaze.

“Haha, I don’t think so. This kid is smarter than you imagine.”

It was more complex than that.

Thinking this, Wu Chuan’s lips curled slightly into a smile, his eyes now carrying more regard and interest for Su Nantian.

Yet Wu Chuan had not yet considered Su Nantian an opponent. At most, he viewed him as a clever junior—still in the observation phase.

Wu Chuan did not believe he needed to go to great lengths against a mere junior like Su Nantian. He would let him ferment first, observing his future actions.

Soon, Wu Chuan would pay a heavy price for this underestimation—and it would be devastating.

Meanwhile, after dealing with Wu Chuan, Su Nantian returned to the Nanjing family. He first met with Nanjing Lin, relaying Wu Chuan’s conditions—including the promise to hand over the entire family for Su Nantian to deal with.

“Absurd!”

Nanjing Lin’s face immediately darkened upon hearing Su Nantian’s words, his anger palpable. He longed to rush at Wu Chuan and tear out his mouth.

“An insignificant Wu Chuan dares to shake the century-old foundation of our Nanjing family! How absurd!”

Nanjing Lin’s anger grew with each thought. His illness caused him to cough violently, his face flushed red as if he would expel his lungs.

“Master, please calm down. Wu Chuan’s audacity shows he is arrogant and overconfident. As the saying goes, ‘arrogant soldiers are doomed.’ Master need not anger over such a petty person, lest it harm your health.”

Su Nantian quickly reassured Nanjing Lin, urging him not to be so angry. He then added: “Still, I feel Wu Chuan’s actions are suspicious.”

“Suspicious? How so?”

Nanjing Lin finally caught his breath and, upon hearing Su Nantian’s words, immediately stared at him with urgency.

“I was speculating—since Wu Chuan so openly revealed his intentions to me, could it be he has already prepared a trump card? Thus, even if I return and inform you, he is not concerned?”

Su Nantian’s intention was to incite Wu Chuan and Nanjing Lin to clash, diverting their attention. The more they fought, the better it suited Su Nantian.

Especially when they were entangled together, it made Su Nantian’s task easier.

This way, he could also take advantage of their distraction to complete his mission without wasting much time.

Chapter 678: Proceeding as Planned

“Hmph! There is indeed this possibility!”

Nanjing Lin, unaware of Su Nantian’s intent, was merely furious. He resented Wu Chuan for his arrogance and disrespect toward the Nanjing family, but also feared his cunning and scheming.

“He has even killed relatives within the clan. He must have more cruel methods to deal with us outsiders! Hmph! What wouldn’t such a heartless man do?”

After speaking, Nanjing Lin let out several more angry huffs.

“You have done well this time. I’ve seen your contribution, and we Nanjing family will never disappoint you.”

Nanjing Lin composed himself before turning to Su Nantian, earnestly advising: “Master, rest assured. I am on your side.”

Su Nantian immediately affirmed his loyalty.

“Master, it’s time to go.”

After arranging Nanjing Lin and Nanjing Yuyan, Su Nantian knew that once he informed them of Wu Chuan’s deal, they would be preoccupied and no longer pay attention to his actions.

After dealing with the most troublesome two in the Nanjing family, Su Nantian now only needed to handle this mediocre master.

That day, he went as usual to discuss the wetland bidding plan with Wu Chuan. This time, Nanjing Ping was determined and confident about securing Wu Chuan’s signature on the contract.

“I will complete my father’s task! I won’t disappoint him!”

Nanjing Ping, sitting beside Su Nantian in the car, suddenly declared with vigor. Whether to boost his own confidence or to show his resolve before Su Nantian, it was unclear.

But regardless of the reason, it only made Su Nantian think Nanjing Ping was truly mediocre and unremarkable.

Thinking this, Su Nantian shook his head silently, casting a vote of no confidence for Nanjing Ping. He also mused that compared to Nanjing Ping’s talent, it would have been better for Nanjing Lin to pass the patriarch position to Nanjing Yuyan.

If the Nanjing family were led by Nanjing Yuyan, it might have thrived for another century. It would be better than watching it decline under Nanjing Ping’s rule.

“Master will surely achieve his goal.”

Though he thought this, Su Nantian still smiled warmly at Nanjing Ping, encouraging him.

As they spoke, they soon arrived at Wu’s territory—the place where they had arranged to meet.

After exiting the car, Su Nantian followed Nanjing Ping closely as per protocol, fulfilling his duty as a bodyguard.

At this moment, Su Nantian was divided in focus—partly pondering what they might discuss next, and partly considering whether to find an opportunity to meet Wu You’er. This would allow him to gather clues from her side.

Thinking of this, Su Nantian feigned an offhand mention of Wu You’er, intending to plant a seed in Nanjing Ping’s mind. This way, he could use Nanjing Ping to bring up Wu You’er.

During their last meeting, Su Nantian had noticed that Wu Chuan intended to match Nanjing Ping with Wu You’er. Thus, having Nanjing Ping bring up Wu You’er might allow Su Nantian to catch a glimpse of her.

Even if he could not communicate with her, at least he needed to confirm her condition and ensure she was safe for now.

“Master, I wonder if this meeting is with Mr. Wu Chuan or Miss Wu You’er? By tradition, it should be Miss Wu You’er who comes to meet you.”

Su Nantian spoke casually, with no suspicious undertones.

Yet this sentence caught Nanjing Ping’s ear and took on a different meaning. He did not know what he had imagined, but immediately gazed at Su Nantian with a suggestive look.

Then, he spoke in a teasing tone: “Previously, when you saw my sister, you were always so serious. I thought you didn’t like beautiful women! But it turns out you prefer Miss Wu You’er!”

Nanjing Yuyan was indeed one of the most beautiful women in inland ports. Thus, Nanjing Ping used her as an example and thought it was unnatural for Su Nantian to have not fallen for Nanjing Yuyan’s charm.

“Upon reflection, Miss Wu You’er is also quite pretty. She looks gentle and delicate—more feminine than my sister, which is why she caught your eye.”

Nanjing Ping did not wait for Su Nantian to respond but continued analyzing, his reasoning sound and convincing.

“Master must not say such things!”

Su Nantian had not expected to accidentally create a mistake, but he also did not expect Nanjing Ping to imagine such romantic scenarios in this serious context.

If the mission were not yet complete and he still needed to act, Su Nantian would have wanted to scold Nanjing Ping for being a fool.

“Master should not joke about me. My status is low, and it’s fine for you to say anything. However, Miss Wu You’er has a high status and is the head of the Wu family. How could I, a mere bodyguard, dare to covet her?”

Su Nantian suppressed his anger and lowered himself further. He also made an excuse to persuade Nanjing Ping: “Moreover, Miss Wu You’er is a woman. We cannot joke about her reputation. Master should not say such things again.”

Nanjing Ping’s teasing was fine, but Su Nantian feared he might accidentally let slip something to Wu Chuan.

Given Wu Chuan’s suspicious nature, if he misunderstood this incident, it would take many detours. Thus, Su Nantian was truly afraid of Nanjing Ping and feared he would continue speaking nonsense.

“Master…”

Su Nantian was stunned, his jaw nearly dropping as he stared at Nanjing Ping with genuine surprise.

“Understand this, Master: Wu Chuan is no easy opponent. It’s no wonder you didn’t reveal your feelings.”

After a pause, Nanjing Ping looked at Su Nantian with deep emotion: “But you shouldn’t underestimate yourself. If you stay by my side, once I become the next patriarch, you will be my most trusted subordinate.”

Chapter 679: A Change of Circumstances

“Master.”

Su Nantian was stunned again, wondering how Nanjing Ping could speak so recklessly.

Even with his quick mind, Su Nantian could not keep up with Nanjing Ping’s thoughts. He did not know what he was thinking.

“Rest assured, as long as you do not betray me, I will eventually fulfill your wish to be with Wu You’er and let you marry her.”

Nanjing Ping spoke firmly, then looked at Su Nantian with encouragement, as if giving him strength.

“Don’t worry, Wu Chuan has marriage intentions, but Wu You’er is not my type. I won’t compete with you.”

Nanjing Ping said this and added another teasing remark, constantly joking about Su Nantian.

What was going on?

Su Nantian nearly exploded!

But before he could clarify, Li Assistant from Wu Chuan arrived. He walked briskly toward them with a polite demeanor.

“Master Nanjing has arrived. Please come this way; the master is waiting in the meeting hall.”

Li Assistant greeted Nanjing Ping politely while casting a furtive glance at Su Nantian behind him. He seemed to recall something, and his gaze toward Su Nantian carried a hint of disdain and resentment.

His expression was so direct it made Su Nantian slightly amused, but he did not let this small matter anger him or provoke a confrontation.

Wasn’t there a saying: the best way to defeat an enemy is to prevent them from ever stepping onto the field?

Li Assistant currently had no response, and he must be feeling his chest tighten.

“Mr. Wu Chuan.”

Nanjing Ping greeted Wu Chuan warmly upon entering, as if their relationship were truly close.

But when it came to acting skills, Wu Chuan could claim second place only to none. Thus, his expression was even more sincere.

“Ah, it’s my nephew!”

Wu Chuan stood up to greet Nanjing Ping. While exchanging pleasantries, he also cast a meaningful glance at Su Nantian, his gaze complex with hidden meanings.

Su Nantian understood it all and returned Wu Chuan’s glance as a response.

Next came the familiar routine Su Nantian had experienced for days: Wu Chuan and Nanjing Ping exchanged flattery, engaging in polite conversation.

Yet, nothing was substantive—only empty words with no real value.

Nanjing Ping was still too young, his methods clumsy compared to Wu Chuan’s. Initially, he could respond well to Wu Chuan, but after a while without hearing what he wanted, his expression grew stiff.

Even the subsequent conversation seemed lackluster and disinterested.

This contrast made him clearly inferior to Wu Chuan by more than a margin.

Su Nantian watched silently, musing whether Nanjing Lin would regret his decision if he were here now. Would he change his mind?

Unfortunately, Nanjing Lin was not present; the only one watching Nanjing Ping’s performance was Wu Chuan.

“Why, nephew? Did I say something wrong?”

Wu Chuan clearly knew the reason for Nanjing Ping’s unease but feigned ignorance, placing the problem on Nanjing Ping.

“Master is overthinking. It’s not your fault.”

Nanjing Ping’s face stiffened at the words, but he quickly composed himself. He then said to Wu Chuan: “I just remembered I haven’t seen Miss Wu You’er in a while. I wonder what she’s busy with now?”

After saying this, Nanjing Ping cast a suggestive glance at Su Nantian.

“Nephew is thoughtful, worrying about Miss Wu You’er.”

Upon hearing this, Wu Chuan’s expression changed. A flicker of impatience flashed across his eyes but quickly disappeared.

Sitting opposite Wu Chuan, Nanjing Ping did not notice the fleeting change in Wu Chuan’s expression. However, Su Nantian, who had been quietly observing Wu Chuan, noticed it immediately.

This change in Wu Chuan caught Su Nantian’s attention. He remained outwardly calm but inwardly felt serious. This sudden shift indicated something was wrong with Wu You’er.

Thinking this, Su Nantian’s expression grew more solemn. He now needed to confirm Wu You’er’s condition. If it was indeed serious, he would change his plan and prioritize taking Wu You’er away.

“Nantian.”

As Su Nantian was silently calculating how to find an opportunity to leave, Nanjing Ping suddenly called out.

Chapter 680: You’er

“Go get the gift box from the car. I forgot one.”

Nanjing Ping spoke casually, as if genuinely wanting the box. In truth, Su Nantian remembered this box was specifically left behind by Nanjing Ping to give to his lover.

After saying this, Nanjing Ping added: “By the way, bring my watch too. It’s in the car. Find it carefully; don’t come back without it.”

“Master?”

Su Nantian was stunned, unsure why Nanjing Ping suddenly targeted him. He remembered that Nanjing Ping had not worn a watch today.

Why would he suddenly speak like this? Did Nanjing Ping intend to send him away?

This thought made Su Nantian’s heart sink. His pupils constricted.

“Don’t you hurry?”

As Su Nantian was speculating, Nanjing Ping spoke again, his tone now impatient and commanding.

But after ordering Su Nantian, Nanjing Ping winked at him playfully, his eyes filled with implication, flirtation, and mockery.

Upon receiving this glance, Su Nantian first hesitated but quickly understood Nanjing Ping’s intention.

He was not intentionally sending him away, but rather feigning a gesture to give him time to meet Wu You’er!

Realizing this, Su Nantian immediately understood Nanjing Ping’s thoughtful gesture.
