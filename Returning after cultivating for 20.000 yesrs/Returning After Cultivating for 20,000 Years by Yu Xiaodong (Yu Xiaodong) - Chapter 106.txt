"Submission? Begging for mercy? Those words don't exist in my dictionary. I'd like to see what the Sea King Gang plans to do with me. You don't need to fear, I know you're all thinking that if I'm taken by the Huang Gang tonight, you'll be implicated too.

Rest assured, I won't suffer any harm under the Sea King Gang's control. Instead of trying to convince me to submit, why don't you all just cheer me on now? Let's see if I can perform at my best tonight. Doing this would be far more practical than your current attempts to persuade me."

Hearing Su Nantian's words, Wang Dasha and the others realized there was no hope left. From earlier, they could see Su Nantian's iron-willed nature—once he made up his mind, no one could change it. Moreover, Su Nantian's martial prowess was so formidable that none could subdue him. Thus, it seemed Su Nantian would only change his mind when he hit a wall and faced the Yellow River's wrath.

Only after being beaten by the Sea King Gang would he realize how foolish he was.

Wang Dasha and his companions could only shake their heads in resignation before saying, "Then we wish Master Nantian to perform at his best tonight. We can only silently cheer for you from within our hearts."

After saying this, Wang Dasha waved his hand, and the others followed him back to their dormitory upstairs.

As soon as they returned to the dorm, Wang Dasha immediately pulled out his phone to make a call.

"What are you doing, Dasha? Calling someone again?" Liu Miao, who was nearby, asked curiously.

"Who else could it be? Obviously calling Super Brother. Let the Nan Gong family send more money so we can bribe the Sea King Gang and avoid a beating. As for Nantian, let him suffer tonight—he might not even make it back."

Hearing Wang Dasha's words, the others nodded in agreement. They didn't want to be beaten and saw that the Sea King Gang was clearly angry today, so they needed to offer more money to save their lives. As for Nantian's fate, it was up to him.

Moreover, Wang Dasha and the others knew about the previous incident with the Wang family. They all thought Nantian's actions would likely end in death.

Wang Dasha signaled the others to stay quiet and redialed Zeng Chao's number. After a long ring, Zeng Chao finally answered.

"What's going on? Why are you calling again? What happened?"

Wang Dasha replied immediately, "Super Brother, it's bad news. Earlier we said the Sea King Gang came for money, but that kid beat them up. They'll probably take him tonight. His fate doesn't matter, but we'll be implicated too. Can the Nan Gong family send some money quickly? We need to pay the Sea King Gang so we can avoid this beating."

After Wang Dasha finished speaking, he waited for Zeng Chao's reply.

"Hahahaha! This is too good. I never thought this kid would be so foolish to seek death. The Sea King Gang are ruthless; even if he's skilled, how could he survive against so many people? The previous Wang family members disappeared quietly. I think Nantian's fate will be the same as theirs."

After hearing Wang Dasha's call, Zeng Chao laughed heartily. At that moment, he was in his room and no one could stop him from doing whatever he wanted.

Moreover, Nan Gong Lin had previously told Zeng Chao not to harm Nantian because he wanted to use him to assist Nan Gong Ping. He only wanted Zeng Chao to give him a lesson.

But now, if the Sea King Gang took action, it would have nothing to do with Zeng Chao. It was all Nantian's own fault for seeking death.

Chapter 523: The Sea King Gang Arrives

After hearing Zeng Chao's laughter, Wang Dasha carefully said, "Super Brother, what should we do about the matter I just mentioned?"

This time, Wang Dasha didn't mention money but subtly reminded Zeng Chao.

"Alright, I'm in a good mood. I'll cover the cost. No need to ask the Nan Gong family for money. As long as we eliminate this nuisance, I can even transfer you all to the Nan Gong family."

Hearing Zeng Chao's words, Wang Dasha could barely suppress his excitement but still spoke in a calm tone: "Thank you, Super Brother. Thank you. Rest assured, this kid is definitely dead tonight. He actually attacked the Sea King Gang members today; he won't escape this fate."

"Hahahaha, enough. I'll send the money now. Let me know immediately if he's taken."

After saying this, Zeng Chao hung up the phone.

At that moment, Wang Dasha was so excited he shouted. The others saw him so happy and felt confused. If it were about money, there was no need to be this excited because the money wasn't theirs. It was just a way to avoid physical punishment.

"What's going on? Why are you so happy and excited? Tell us, let us be happy too. We're all on edge now; why don't you tell us the good news immediately?" Sun Qi poked Wang Dasha and said.

Wang Dasha made a gesture to calm everyone down before saying, "Super Brother has agreed to send us money."

Upon hearing this, the others looked disappointed and said, "I thought it was something worth being happy about. This isn't worth getting so excited."

"What's the rush? I'm not finished yet. Super Brother said if this kid is really taken by the Sea King Gang, he'll transfer us out of Ruo Hai District."

After Wang Dasha said this, the others didn't show much excitement. They chose to stay here because the salary was much higher than outside. If they were transferred to other Nan Gong family businesses, their wages would be only a fraction of what they earned here.

"That's not really great news..." After hearing Wang Dasha's words, their expectations vanished. They felt that if they were transferred out of here, it would be uncomfortable. Although life was tense and fearful here, it didn't threaten their lives, and earning money was easy. They just sat there doing nothing.

Seeing their expressions, Wang Dasha smiled again and continued: "I'm not finished yet. Super Brother said he would transfer us to the Nan Gong family's mansion."

"What? Is that true? Are you lying to us? Transferring us to the Nan Gong family's mansion?"

"Wow, this is finally good news! I've finally made it out of the bottom!"

They immediately became as excited as Wang Dasha had been because the Nan Gong family's mansion was the highest position for the Nan Gong family's bodyguards. Moreover, their salaries there were far more than what they earned here.

"Anyway, we can only hope that this kid is taken by the Sea King Gang tonight. Pray he doesn't come back. Trading one person for our futures is worth it."

Wang Dasha said this while smiling, and they felt no shame for their thoughts.

After all, they were part of the lowest class in society. Their only concern was how to climb up from their basic needs. They were now in the lowest social environment, and the Sea King Gang's threats made their lives unbearable. They lived in constant fear of physical punishment.

Yet, despite this, they couldn't leave because they were reluctant to give up the higher wages here. But now, if Nantian's departure could get them into the Nan Gong family's mansion, it was the best and most justified opportunity for them.

However, at that moment, Su Nantian downstairs was completely unaware of Wang Dasha's discussion and didn't know he had become a pawn for their promotion.

Now, Su Nantian could only wait and hope that the Sea King Gang would indeed send people to take him as Wang Dasha had said.

But time passed, and the sky gradually darkened. Su Nantian sat alone downstairs.

Finally, he heard the sound of a car engine and realized there were quite a few people. There were probably seven or eight cars.

He could also hear loud shouting, and someone shouted: "Let me see where that Nan Gong kid is. He's really arrogant! Tonight, we'll take him and educate him properly at the Sea King Gang."

At that moment, Wang Dasha and his companions upstairs also heard this sound. They didn't dare to go down but could only watch from the window.

They saw several cars parked next to their building. From the cars, more than ten people got out, each carrying a baseball bat or similar weapon.

They could tell these people weren't the ones from Qiao. They were unfamiliar faces, suggesting that Qiao had reported this to the Sea King Gang's upper echelons. Just like how they dealt with the Wang family, these people had come to deal with Su Nantian.

Wang Dasha immediately pulled out his phone from his pocket and took a short video of the scene to send to Zeng Chao. After all, Zeng Chao had previously told him that when Su Nantian was taken by the Sea King Gang, he should call him.

Wang Dasha thought that sending a video would be more direct and might make Zeng Chao even happier.

So he immediately recorded the scene outside and sent it to Zeng Chao. He was afraid Zeng Chao might miss it, so he also called him.

This time, Zeng Chao answered the phone quickly because he had been waiting all night for Wang Dasha's call.

"Super Brother, the Sea King Gang has arrived. But they haven't started yet. We'll stay upstairs and not go down. Once they take Nantian, I'll send another video. Look at the one I just took."

Wang Dasha said this as if boasting.

Chapter 524: Calmness

After hearing Wang Dasha's video, Zeng Chao immediately hung up the phone. He wanted to see what the Sea King Gang's strength was.

The video was clear, showing that the Sea King Gang had brought many people. There were several cars, and people came down in large numbers.

After seeing this, Zeng Chao laughed heartily.

"Nantian, you've really finished. The master told me not to harm you, but this has nothing to do with me. It's all your own fault for being so arrogant. Just like when you first came to the Nan Gong family, since you've offended the Sea King Gang, you must bear the consequences."

As Zeng Chao spoke, his expression became more sinister. He still remembered how Su Nantian had acted when he first came to the Nan Gong family, which had brought down the number one bodyguard of the Nan Gong family and caused great embarrassment.

After returning from the hospital, every time he saw someone, it felt like they were pointing and whispering behind his back.

Moreover, because of himself and Zhang Yu's injuries, they hadn't gone to the Wu family's inheritance banquet. Instead, it was Su Nantian who had taken their place.

Previously, such events were always accompanied by himself and Zhang Yu. This year, they had been replaced by Su Nantian. Although there were reasons related to his physical condition, he still felt that everything was caused by Su Nantian.

So now, with Su Nantian having offended the Sea King Gang and his future clearly visible, Zeng Chao felt overjoyed.

Meanwhile, Su Nantian was sitting upright in the house waiting for the Sea King Gang to arrive.

The Sea King Gang members each carried a baseball bat and walked in boldly. After entering the door, they smashed a small table at the entrance with their bats.

Su Nantian remained calm throughout this, even wearing a mysterious smile on his face.

"You're the one called Nantian?" The person leading said, pointing at Su Nantian.

Su Nantian nodded. "Yes, I am Nantian. What do you want with me?"

Su Nantian's tone was calm and composed, as if he didn't know why these people had come for him.

"What do you mean? What are you doing here?" The person asked again.

"I don't know what you want with me. If you have something to say, just say it clearly and directly. Circumlocution is pointless."

Su Nantian was deliberately provoking them, hoping to make them more angry. The higher their anger, the more they would hate him, and the more likely they would take him to the Sea King Gang. Perhaps he could meet more people there.

His plan was to provoke them as much as possible, seeing if he could meet the Sea King Gang's leader.

"Looks like you don't care about your life!" The person swung his bat and smashed the table in front of Su Nantian.

Su Nantian nodded, thinking these people were much better than the one called Qiao today. One swing could smash this solid wood table, showing their strength was considerable.

"You're really arrogant. You still don't fear me? I guess you won't change your mind until you hit a wall. How can you think you'll walk out of here unscathed with so many people?"

The person watched Su Nantian playfully, as he hadn't seen such a person in a long time. Even the previous Wang family members who had caused trouble, when they saw themselves surrounded, had cried and run away. But this Su Nantian was still arrogant despite being surrounded by people.

This made the person doubt whether he was truly a tough nut or just pretending to be calm.

The person looked around and laughed coldly: "How come you're alone? Where are the others from Nan Gong family? Did they leave you here alone?"

Su Nantian shook his head. "This is my own matter, unrelated to them. You can come at me directly."

Although Su Nantian didn't have a good impression of Wang Dasha and the others, he knew it was better to involve as few people as possible. Moreover, he could handle the Sea King Gang's people, but Wang Dasha and the others couldn't.

"You didn't expect this kid to be so loyal, did you?"

"No, it's not loyalty. I don't know them well, and involving people who aren't familiar with me isn't beneficial for me. I don't need anyone to die with me."

Su Nantian said this calmly again.

"Did they tell you what happens if you offend the Sea King Gang?"

Su Nantian nodded. "They did tell me, saying that you'll be taken by the Sea King Gang and never return."

"Then why aren't you afraid yet?"

"There's no need to be afraid. Have you finished talking? If so, we can go now."

Su Nantian said this coldly. He knew the real action wasn't here, and talking more with this person was useless. He wanted to go directly to the Sea King Gang's headquarters.

The person heard Su Nantian say this and was clearly angry. He pointed at Su Nantian: "Good, you really have backbone. You truly don't change your mind until you hit a wall. Since you want to be taken, then go. Do I need to invite you?"

Su Nantian immediately stood up calmly from his chair and walked towards the door.

These people instinctively made a path for Su Nantian. These subordinates had never seen such a person before.

Previously, the people the Sea King Gang attacked had never been calm. They all cried and begged for mercy or even committed suicide when desperate.

But this person seemed completely fearless, very calm. This made them a little interested.

"Big brother, do you think this kid is faking it or really isn't afraid?" Another subordinate asked the previous person after watching Su Nantian walk out so calmly.

"Whether it's fake or real, he'll be coming with us. Now he thinks there's nothing to worry about, just that they surrounded him. But once he gets to our headquarters, it'll be out of his control. Then even crying won't help."

Chapter 525: Challenge

After Su Nantian walked out of the house, he got into a car casually. The Sea King Gang members also got in, but it seemed no high-ranking person was with him. All were these subordinates holding baseball bats and watching him curiously.

They had never seen a person so calm before. Previously, those taken by the Sea King Gang would all howl and cry when they got into the car. But this person was quietly sitting there without any resistance.

Then, the cars started one by one and drove towards their Sea King Gang headquarters.

Before arriving at the Sea King Gang's headquarters, Su Nantian had thought about what it would look like. After all, this whole Ruo Hai District was neither big nor small. This group gathered here to collect money from several families and had other businesses, so their headquarters should be built quite opulently.

Su Nantian thought it would at least be a luxurious villa, even if not as grand as the family estates.

But when the car stopped, he was quite surprised. The place they arrived at clearly looked like a factory.

However, Su Nantian could tell from the decorations, buildings, and number of people that it was indeed the Sea King Gang's headquarters.

Su Nantian hadn't expected these people to be so nostalgic, rich as they were but living in such a place.

After Su Nantian got out of the car, another group of Sea King Gang members surrounded him. Su Nantian estimated that there were about a hundred people in the courtyard.

They all held various attack weapons, like war hammers, baseball bats, and batons. There were so many it was hard to count.

Su Nantian suddenly felt like he had returned to his youth, seeing those delinquent youths with these items going out for fights.

But these things were nothing to Su Nantian. He didn't fear them at all. Even if they had guns, he wouldn't be afraid.

After standing there, these people immediately surrounded Su Nantian. Now, he was surrounded by nearly a hundred people. If he wanted to leave, he would have to break through this group.

But Su Nantian didn't plan to leave. He wanted to meet the Sea King Gang's leader.

At this moment, the person who had returned also stood in front of him and said: "I heard you asked Xiao Qiao about the Sea King Gang's rules before?"

Su Nantian was stunned. He didn't know who Xiao Qiao was, but he suddenly remembered the people calling him "Qiao Brother" today. He realized that Xiao Qiao was probably this person.

So Su Nantian nodded and replied, "Yes, I wanted to ask if the Sea King Gang's rules are really as people say—everything is decided by fists and strength."

After saying this, Su Nantian also waved his fist.

The person smiled and said, "Yes, the Sea King Gang's rules are decided by strength. But whether you have strength depends on if you can beat them."

"If I defeat the Sea King Gang's strongest person, would I become your leader?" Su Nantian said excitedly after hearing this.

He had originally planned to talk about the Nan Gong family's matters in Ruo Hai District with the Sea King Gang leader. But if this person said everything was decided by fists, then if he could beat their leader, wouldn't he be able to rule the Sea King Gang?

That would be a good force for himself. Moreover, this force was beyond anyone's control in the capital. As long as they controlled their behavior, no one would interfere with them. This way, he could have a hidden force in the capital.

"Hahahaha! I've never seen such an arrogant kid. You asked this question right away. Can your leader be defeated so easily? And if you want to defeat our leader, you have to get close to him."

"Master Tao, don't talk nonsense with this kid. Let me deal with him," a subordinate next to Master Tao said immediately, eager to teach Su Nantian a lesson.

Su Nantian looked at him and asked calmly, "So what's your rule? Are you going to have all these hundred people fight me?"

Master Tao shook his head. "Why a hundred? If you want to prove your strength, just have a match. If you can beat these five people and win, I'll let you go back. We'll overlook this incident today. But we hope the Nan Gong family will be more careful in the future."

"I don't want to go back. I said before I wanted to meet your Sea King Gang leader. If there's an opportunity, I want to try defeating him and becoming your leader," Su Nantian shook his head, looking very helpless.

"You must be crazy! Master Tao, I'll deal with this kid now!" The person next to Master Tao said and was about to step forward, but Master Tao stopped him with his hand.

"Alright, you're interesting. This is the first time we've met someone like you. So I'll give you a way out. From these people, I'll select ten of the strongest to fight you. If you can defeat them, I'll let you go up a level. But you must challenge the next people to meet our leader. Whether the next people want to play with you is up to them; I can't decide. If you're willing, we'll do it like this."

Su Nantian hadn't expected Master Tao to agree to such a challenge, so he immediately nodded and accepted it.

This was exactly what Su Nantian wanted. He had been thinking about how to get close to the Sea King Gang's upper echelons.

After hearing Master Tao speak, he realized his level wasn't particularly high. So if he wanted to go further up, he had to defeat them first.

Su Nantian didn't find this tedious at all. On the contrary, he thought that things decided by strength and climbing step by step was more in line with what he wanted to do now. If he could defeat these people one by one and finally meet the Sea King Gang's leader, it would be an interesting thing.

Chapter 526: Lightning Fast

After Master Tao spoke, he observed Su Nantian's expression. They had previously dealt with people like Su Nantian without letting them fight in a wheel, as they had done with the Wang family. They had taken those people here and beaten them to death.

This time, there was an exception because he thought this person looked really interesting. He still had no fear and seemed to believe he could escape successfully.

Master Tao didn't respond, so he smiled and said, "What's wrong? Are you afraid? Don't you accept this rule?"

Su Nantian smiled, "Then let's follow your rules. I thought there was something else to add. If that's the case, it's really simple. It seems you're taking care of me."

Hearing Su Nantian say this, the man next to Master Tao couldn't hold back and jumped out, pointing his war hammer at Su Nantian: "I think you're really out of line. How could you say such things at this time!"

After saying this, he turned to Master Tao and said: "Master Tao, let me take the first shot. Among these hundred people, I can rank in the top ten."

Master Tao nodded after hearing this. This person was indeed among the top ten.

This person's nickname was Xiao Douzi. His feature was his agility, often attacking unexpectedly. Even if you were stronger than him, if you were caught off guard by his speed, you would still fall to him.

This Xiao Douzi saw Master Tao nod and knew he had agreed. He immediately walked in front of Su Nantian with his war hammer and said: "What weapon do you want? Tell me quickly."

Su Nantian shook his head. "I don't need anything. Just my bare hands are enough. If you need a weapon, I have no objections."

Su Nantian had no fear of his war hammer at all. This thing was nothing to him.

"You're too arrogant! Then don't regret it. Since you're acting like this, I'll show you a lesson." This Xiao Douzi didn't throw his war hammer but held it in hand. Since Su Nantian said he could use a weapon, he would definitely take one.

No one called for the start. This Xiao Douzi immediately rushed towards Su Nantian with his war hammer.

When he ran, Su Nantian could feel his speed was much faster than usual.

Su Nantian immediately understood this person's strategy. This person must be fast but not strong.

From his physique, he was slimmer than others, but being in the top ten among these hundred people meant he had his own unique strength.

Su Nantian didn't take it too seriously but wouldn't be careless. When this Xiao Douzi rushed towards him, his feet had already prepared to dodge. He didn't plan to directly accept the first move but wanted to see how fast this person was.

This Xiao Douzi's speed was fast, and he had already reached Su Nantian. At this moment, the war hammer swung towards Su Nantian's body.

Su Nantian stepped back and turned around to dodge this move. But at that moment, he noticed this person immediately swung another hammer, and his reaction speed was very fast. It was exactly at the position where Su Nantian had dodged.

Su Nantian smiled. This person must have known he couldn't accept this move from the beginning, so that first move was just a feint. However, he had already predicted Su Nantian's dodging route and hit him again from the other side. If it were a normal person, they would have been unable to dodge this second move. But for Su Nantian, it was nothing.

At that moment, this Xiao Douzi moved his feet again and rushed to Su Nantian's back.

At the same time, those watching cheered. They thought this match was over because now Xiao Douzi's war hammer had swung towards Su Nantian's back.

Master Tao also sneered and said, "I thought he was a big deal. But it ended so quickly. I guess he's just talkative. I thought he had some skills, but now I know I shouldn't have given him this chance."

After saying this, Master Tao turned to leave and signaled the people nearby to come and clean up Su Nantian's body.

But at that moment, he suddenly heard a shout from the crowd. When Master Tao turned around again, it was not Su Nantian who had fallen but Xiao Douzi.

The war hammer was still in Xiao Douzi's hand, so it was clear that Su Nantian had defeated him with his bare hands.

And at this moment, Su Nantian made a hand knife gesture, which must have been the move.

At this moment, Su Nantian shook his head and smiled. He patted his hands: "Luring the enemy into a trap, thinking to set a trap for others but ended up being trapped by them."

Except for Master Tao who didn't see that moment, everyone else saw the lightning-fast move. They thought Xiao Douzi had already won. When his war hammer was about ten centimeters away from Su Nantian's head, Su Nantian suddenly turned around and swept his leg to knock Xiao Douzi down. Then he turned around and slashed with a hand knife towards Xiao Douzi's neck.

Then it became this scene, and Su Nantian had only used one move. Xiao Douzi should have already fainted.

Someone came to check and found that Xiao Douzi had started foaming at the mouth.

In short, Su Nantian's hand knife was a mercy. If he had used full strength, it would have been enough to kill Xiao Douzi instantly.

"Has this person already defeated one? But I think it's too troublesome to have the rest come one by one. If you're willing, they can all come at once. You can use any weapon you want." Su Nantian looked at the fallen Xiao Douzi and then at the people standing outside. He felt that defeating the remaining nine one by one would take too long.

Chapter 527: Easily Defeated

The people who had just been praising Su Nantian's strength now, after hearing his words, felt he was too arrogant and proud. They had initially felt admiration but now turned to anger.

This person had only defeated one of them, and yet he was already so boastful. He said they could all come at once.

"You're just lucky, I admit you have some skills. But now you're saying this, do you think you're overestimating yourself?" Master Tao turned around and said to Su Nantian.

Su Nantian shrugged. "If you don't want to, that's fine. I can accompany you and fight step by step. But this is really boring, it feels annoying. If you can all come at once, it would be faster for me."

"Alright, since you're so eager to die, I'll grant your wish." Master Tao said and turned around to point at the people behind him.

"Alright, everyone stop standing here. Since he asked for it, you can play with him. This kid is asking to be taken down, so don't hold back."

After Master Tao said this, several people stepped forward. They were of different heights and body types but had the same fierce look. Su Nantian could immediately tell they were all skilled.

Moreover, this was the result of years of fighting and killing. They had a violent aura that immediately showed up, different from the Nan Gong family's bodyguards.

Su Nantian looked at them and suddenly frowned. "Wait, why are there only eight here? It should be nine people left. One of them ran away?"

Su Nantian deliberately looked puzzled, trying to provoke these people. The more he provoked them, the faster they would attack him. Then he wouldn't have to fight each one by one and could meet the higher-ranking members of the Sea King Gang.

"Stop looking. I'm here," Master Tao suddenly said.

Su Nantian then looked like he understood and clapped his hands. "Good, good. There's also you. Then the numbers are complete. You can all come now."

Su Nantian said this while hooking his finger, indicating they could come up.

"Don't be careless. Hit him to death," Master Tao ordered, and the remaining people rushed towards Su Nantian.

Su Nantian nodded. This Master Tao still had a clear mind, not letting his provocation and Su Nantian's seemingly overconfident behavior affect his judgment. Always maintain a mindset of not underestimating, even if the opponent was just one person or they had more numbers. You must do everything with full effort.

So these people rushed towards Su Nantian immediately, and each wanted to occupy a different position. They planned to surround Su Nantian from different directions and attack him, which was their strategy of numerical superiority. It was the safest and most secure method.

But Su Nantian had no idea they would use this approach. This strategy seemed solid, but if Su Nantian knocked one person down, he would have a gap. Then their formation of surrounding him would collapse.

Moreover, these people had different fighting styles. Some were strong and others were skilled in martial arts.
