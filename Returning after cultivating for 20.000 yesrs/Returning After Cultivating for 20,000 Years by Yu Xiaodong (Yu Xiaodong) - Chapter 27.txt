When he heard Wu Elder’s words, Su Nantian felt an inner joy! He had previously crafted the Fuyun Sword but due to scarce materials, it was only a short blade, something he had long regretted.

Now, someone was voluntarily offering him materials—this was truly the best of all scenarios. After today, perhaps Fuyun Sword could be upgraded! It was just like when one is about to doze off, and someone brings a pillow.

Should it be a large double-bladed sword or a halberd or a mo dao?

Su Nantian’s heart stirred. A团 of purple flame rose from his hand, not just any fire—this was the Hunling Purple Flame he used for refining artifacts.

Though this flame was fierce and powerful, even in the two millennia of his cultivation in the immortal realm, Su Nantian had rarely used it against opponents. The reason was simple: before the Hunling Purple Flame could even be unleashed, enemies would flee in terror.

With a flick of his hand, a massive clump of purple flame left Su Nantian’s palm and descended upon the vermilion red door. Though this door was layered with countless arrays, most were merely for fortification, repair, and control—no counterattacks. The arrays were crude, as if the one who crafted this door had learned from Wu’s wife. The copper cap on the door was a node of the array, glaringly obvious.

Without anyone controlling it, this door was like a low-grade artifact tossed into Su Nantian’s refining furnace—utterly powerless.

If Wu’s steward knew what Su Nantian was thinking, he would have died laughing. This junk dared to call itself a treasure? It was merely the lowest grade artifact. If Su Nantian hadn’t wanted to reveal his Fuyun Sword, he could have sliced through this scrap with a single stroke!

The purple Hunling Flame spread downward, and the arrays carved into the door could not even hinder it for a moment. Within half a teacup’s time, the massive vermilion door was indeed scorched open—though "scorched" seemed inaccurate; it was more like melted!

“You…”

At this moment, Wu’s steward finally realized something was amiss. He attempted to shout a warning but felt an immense pressure pressing upon him!

In that moment, his teeth chattered uncontrollably, and he could not even open his mouth to speak.

“Wu Steward, are you alright?”

Su Nantian turned around, his face half-smiling as if genuinely concerned.

“Since you’re fine, I’ll continue then!”

With that, Su Nantian moved his fingers. The Hunling Flame clinging to the door burned even more wildly, and the hole expanded further.

Within minutes, he had completely melted the entire door! A massive block of black Xuan Iron floated in midair, which Su Nantian casually tossed into his storage ring. For him, once something was in hand, it would never be let go.

At this point, Wu’s steward felt the pressure lift. His entire body was drenched in sweat as if he had just been pulled from water.

That pressure which left him utterly powerless—such a feeling, he had never experienced even on the elders. Perhaps only the former head of the family could reach such a level; even the new young master was slightly lacking.

Wu’s steward himself was a cultivator, but his cultivation level was low—only at the peak of the Qi Condensation stage. Though he could be a burden to commoners, to Su Nantian, he was truly insignificant.

“Wu Steward? Wu Steward?”

Su Nantian called out twice, waking the elderly man who had been lost in thought. He asked: “Now I should be able to enter through the main gate, right? Where do we go next?”

Su Nantian’s words brought Wu’s steward back to his senses. He dared not delay further and quickly bowed low, leading the way.

Yet he secretly made a gesture, instructing the nearby servants to reach the central hall ahead of time to report.

Such subtle actions naturally escaped Su Nantian’s spiritual sense, but he didn’t care. Today, regardless of anything, he was a guest with an invitation—guests must behave like guests. Naturally, one should wait for the host to be ready, right?

Chapter 123: Iron Throne

The gatekeeper ran swiftly to the central hall, intending to report to the family head. However, upon arrival, he found all elders and the senior master of Qingyang Sect instantly focused their gazes on him. His face was pale, and he was utterly flustered.

“Speak!”

The one who spoke was the Fifth Elder, his face dark and gloomy. He felt something was off.

Among those present, only he had truly met Su Nantian before. From their brief encounter last time, this Su Nantian was no ordinary person.

After waiting so long without anyone coming, something must have happened!

“F-Family Head... Elders... Master Su... has dismantled the guardian door!”

The gatekeeper was so nervous he stammered, trembling as he finished his report and bowed low, afraid to utter a single word for fear of angering these great figures.

At this moment, the hall was so silent it could have been heard dropping a pin. Neither Wu’s elders nor the young master, nor Qingyang Sect's Sun Peng dared to believe their ears.

The guardian door was the accumulated wealth of generations of Wu family, the foundation that allowed the Wu clan to stand for millennia. Even during past wars, it had withstood twelve cannons without a scratch. Yet now, they heard the news—had the guardian door been dismantled? How could that be?

No one in the Wu family believed it. After disbelief came shock, for they all knew if this gatekeeper said so, the truth was undeniable.

No one dared to lie in this matter.

“How was it dismantled? Where is the door now?”

This question came from Sun Peng of Qingyang Sect. As an outsider, he was shocked by the Wu family’s door being dismantled but could still hold himself together.

In fact, this guardian door had long been something he wanted to dismantle. However, on one hand, he lacked a good method; on the other hand, Wu family was still an affiliated clan of Qingyang Sect. He couldn’t openly tear down their foundation.

But now, it seemed like an opportunity. If the guardian door couldn’t be reassembled, he could take a piece without issue.

Who was lucky enough to witness this? It was just fate—those present would share in it!

“Elder Eight, go out and check the situation outside.”

Sun Peng’s eyes were full of interest, barely concealing his gaze.

The elderly young master remained silent, unsure what he was thinking.

Wu Elder sighed helplessly and ordered him.

At this moment, the Wu family was truly strange. The head of the family seemed to be a blend of the old master and the young master, achieving an uneasy balance. Though it was better than before when they were all mad, their minds had become more gloomy and rarely spoke.

Originally nine elders, now only three remained after some died or were injured. They barely supported this broken Wu family but had already reached their limit.

As for Qingyang Sect, they were of no help at all. If the Wu family fell, they would be the first to rush in like wolves, sucking out every last drop of value from Wu family.

Then, with a nod, they could easily raise another Wu family—perhaps even without the surname Wu. They would build it right on this ruin!

Though its depth was not as profound as the current Wu family, it would be easier for Qingyang Sect to control.

Thinking of this, Fifth Elder’s face was bitter. Perhaps the great Wu family had truly declined.

Hearing Fifth Elder's words, Elder Eight was about to stand up when a loud laugh echoed from outside: “Ahahaha! How could you trouble Elder Eight to come out and greet me? I, Su, have already arrived!”

Hearing Su Nantian’s voice, everyone present instantly changed faces, their expressions darkened.

They hadn’t expected this Su to have already arrived at the door. If he didn’t speak, they had no idea—he was truly terrifying.

Seeing their expressions, Su Nantian smiled inwardly. These were really unrefined country bumpkins; a simple concealment technique had frightened them so much.

The cultivation world of immortals had traditions spanning millions of years, while the Earth’s cultivation circle was only a few thousand years. Though its development speed was indeed fast, it lagged behind in some aspects.

Especially in the subtlety of spells, it was vastly different.

Su Nantian naturally wouldn’t explain to them. He surveyed the room and noticed no seat for himself, so he slightly understood.

It seemed entering through the side door was just the first step—disheartening him, then pressuring him in the hall. If it were an ordinary person, they wouldn’t be able to handle it! Then they would have to stand by the hall or find a chair in the corner.

But Su Nantian was no ordinary person. He subtly moved his mind and fell into a free fall, sitting down behind him.

At the moment he sat down, the void behind him slightly rippled. A massive heavy black throne suddenly appeared there!

The throne weighed several tons and crashed onto the ground, shaking the entire room. Though it had array enhancements, it still caused chaos.

Su Nantian sat on the throne, smiling as he gazed at the two people before him.

In China’s traditional houses, it was customary to sit facing north and south. Sun Peng and the Wu family's young master sat on the main seat, facing the door.

Su Nantian suddenly placed a throne here. It was tall and large, giving him an overwhelming sense of superiority.

With sunlight shining from behind him, it was blocked by him. From Sun Peng’s perspective, it seemed to be radiant with a divine aura, as if a deity had descended.

The massive throne was black in color but also glossy. It was entirely made from the Wu family’s door, requiring no arrays—just a simple shaping. For Su Nantian, the refining speed was extremely fast.

The design was mythic—behind it were skeletal figures, and beneath its feet were the bones of deities. At this moment, Su Nantian seemed like a vengeful spirit returning from the battlefield, slaughtering gods and demons!

Seeing Su Nantian’s entrance and this evil-looking throne, these people were somewhat frightened.

Chapter 124: Same Origin

Only two people in the room weren’t affected by Su Nantian’s aura. One was Sun Peng from Qingyang Sect, but he was secretly swallowing his saliva, unable to resist the temptation.

Sun Peng was also a connoisseur. He immediately realized this throne was entirely made of Xuan Iron!

Even though Xuan Iron was a common refining material, it was still rare. The Qingyang Sect, with its thousands of years of heritage, only used Xuan Iron for the swords of official disciples. Each sword was limited to four catties and three taels, barely enough for the blade itself—no hilt at all.

Now this person had forged a throne with tons of Xuan Iron. Sun Peng’s eyes were red with envy, thinking it was extravagant—too extravagant!

He was the son of a Qingyang Sect inner sect elder, barely an immortal second-generation. When had he ever been so extravagant?

His sword, entirely made of Xuan Iron, was earned through his own efforts—plus some help from his father. He cherished it like a treasure, and the envy of his peers was always directed at him. When would he have such a throne?

Sun Peng’s envy, Su Nantian could understand. But the strange-looking person—this one looked like a ghost—left Su Nantian puzzled.

He was merely a seventeen or eighteen-year-old boy, yet his face looked like that of a fifty-year-old. His head had some white hair, making him look quite eerie.

This person hadn’t spoken since Su Nantian entered the room. His face had no expression, but his eyes were fixed on the death crow perched on Su Nantian’s shoulder.

It seemed that Grand Elder had ordered him to track down Su Nantian.

The death crow, Xiaohei, perched on Su Nantian’s shoulder, felt uncomfortable under the gaze of those emotionless eyes. Its feathers were even raised.

It whispered lowly into Su Nantian’s ear, “Gack gack... gack... gack gack…” Though it was low, in the silence of the hall, it was quite noticeable.

But only Su Nantian could understand the death crow’s language. Others were completely confused.

After gacking for a while, Xiaohei conveyed two things:

First, he truly thought Su Nantian’s throne was very cool and had great taste! Such a throne with death and hellish atmosphere could not be without his death crow. So he wanted Su Nantian to add a statue of himself on the backrest.

Su Nantian nodded, saying it was no problem. He had made a pact with this raven. Though the changes it brought were not very obvious, at least once it had saved his life. It was loyal!

Such a small request Su Nantian naturally wouldn’t refuse, nor did he need to.

The second thing was that the death crow said he felt a similar origin to himself on this ghost-like person, and that this aura was even higher than his!

Su Nantian was a bit confused about the death crow’s statement. But he knew that this person's goal was the death crow—enough.

Xiaohei wasn’t a pure-bred death crow but had transformed from an ordinary raven. So although it bore the name of a death crow, its memories of death crow’s heritage were not many. Many situations were just vague feelings—what the specific content was, Su Nantian would have to figure out himself.

Su Nantian nodded slightly and then turned serious, addressing the two people before him: “I wonder what business you have invited me here for?”

To match this throne, Su Nantian naturally changed his address.

“Hahaha... Master? Little brat, you have a big mouth! Don’t you fear the wind will blow your tongue off?

Think you’ve defeated two trash and now consider yourself a person?

Actually, hand over the death crow. Otherwise I’ll take it myself!”

The one speaking was none other than Wu family’s young master. But from his voice and words, it seemed he was controlled by the old clan head.

For some reason, he couldn’t leave Wu family’s territory. So he had only called Su Nantian over. Since the eldest, fourth, and sixth were all trash who had been defeated, he decided to take matters into his own hands and reclaim the death crow that belonged to him!

Actually, this death crow was indeed related to Wu family’s old thief.

The reason for the current situation mainly stemmed from the cultivation methods of Wu family's ancestors!

Most Wu family members cultivated Qingyang Sect’s techniques, but the lineage of Wu family head had its own inheritance.

It was said to be inherited from an ancient immortal, Master Qingming, and called “The True Explanation of Qingming Return.”

“Qingming” means not yet clear, drifting back and forth, returning from death to life!

What specific effects “The True Explanation of Qingming Return” had was unknown. However, each generation’s head experienced some abnormality upon taking over the position.

But why this time had become so intense, leading to Wu family’s potential collapse?

“Come at me then! Let me see your strength!”

Su Nantian was no longer a rookie in the immortal world. With two millennia of cultivation, his life experience surpassed everyone present.

From the aura alone, this head wasn’t bluffing. Perhaps he truly had some skills. Su Nantian also wanted to see how strong his own strength was—this was a good grinding stone!

With two millennia of experience, few people could confuse him. This old monster was one of them. Even Su Nantian couldn’t figure out his situation at first glance.

Though he wore a young man’s body, the information radiating from him gave Su Nantian a feeling of decay. It was as if this soul had rotted for years and even started to stink.

Few things on Earth interested Su Nantian. But this monster had piqued his interest slightly.

“Come on!”

As he spoke, a dark golden light appeared at his fingertip, like a nimble little snake.

“Sword cultivator!”

The cold and bone-chilling words came from Wu family’s head. He was a bit surprised but not at all panicked.

However, others hearing this word all involuntarily took a deep breath and felt chills run down their spines.

Chapter 125: Who is the Sky's Chosen One

"Sword cultivator?"

Sun Peng heard this familiar yet strange name, his face forced to remain calm. His mind was in turmoil. He knew what a sword cultivator meant, but he had never imagined that a sword cultivator could reach such a level!

Qingyang Sect always claimed to be a sect of sword cultivators. The sect had countless sword techniques. Every disciple practiced sword from childhood, forging their own divine weapons.

This blade was inseparable from its wielder, life and death together. It was just like in various wuxia novels—sword alive, person alive; sword dead, person dead.

Su Peng had always thought this was what a sword cultivator was. But today, after feeling Su Nantian’s suffocating sword qi, it felt like his worldview had been overturned!

Su Peng's mind was chaotic and confused. He didn’t expect that, while he was bewildered, a stronger aura suddenly erupted from Wu family’s head!

This aura was so strong it made Sun Peng feel a bit of fear. His right hand instinctively gripped his sword hilt, which gave him half a sense of security.

Sun Peng devoted himself to the sword. Since he could remember, his life had revolved around it. He never left home without it—eating, sleeping, even going to the bathroom he carried it.

From childhood to now, he had regarded his three-foot sword as his most trusted companion. In times of danger and困境, as long as he held the sword in hand, he wasn’t alone in battle. His heart would calm down and dawn would come after night battles.

But now, the aura Wu family’s head released was so strong it made Sun Peng feel desperate! He had thought his Qi Condensation high-level strength was enough to look down on anyone in this small Wu family.

But he hadn’t expected that the young Wu head still had such cultivation!

His face turned slightly grim. Qingyang Sect always thought they controlled everything about Wu family, but never expected them to have such a powerful head!

This aura made Sun Peng feel even stronger than his master. It was hard not to suspect Wu family of having ulterior motives.

At this moment, Wu family’s head didn’t look at Sun Peng. To him, he was just an ant with no threat. But this young man on the throne gave him a sense of danger.

He couldn’t remember how many years it had been since he felt this way. It was truly exciting. He extended his red tongue and licked his lips, saying:

“You really won’t hand over the original pearl? Then I’ll take it myself!”

His voice was still old and hoarse, like a rusted iron sheet scraping glass.

“Original pearl? What original pearl? I have a old sow here. Do you want it?”

Though Su Nantian replied with no courtesy, he was secretly alert and didn’t let his guard down.

This old man’s sudden aura was so strong it had taken him by surprise. From the aura alone, he might have reached the high-level of innate foundation. But whether he truly had that strength was unknown.

If he could indeed unleash the high-level innate foundation strength, Su Nantian would turn around and run immediately. As for the original pearl or even the death crow, he would hand them over without hesitation.

What was integrity worth? Two dollars for two catties?

But although Su Nantian’s face was serious, he also felt a sigh of relief.

This old man had some old injuries or other hidden issues. In short, his true strength was far from as strong as he appeared.

Using common sense, if he truly had high-level innate foundation strength, why would he waste words with Su Nantian? He would have just taken it!

The reason he hadn’t attacked was only because of some hesitation. Therefore, his strength wasn’t as strong as it seemed.

In the world of immortals, there was no such thing as reasoning!

Might is right!

If it were ordinary Earth cultivators facing this old man’s aura, they would have been terrified at first.

But by using this method to face Su Nantian, it was somewhat counterproductive! Although Su Nantian’s current cultivation level wasn’t high, he had spent two millennia in the immortal world. His experience in life-and-death battles was far beyond that of this old man. Naturally, he could immediately discern his true situation.

If he hadn’t revealed his aura, Su Nantian might have taken some time to figure out his depth. But since he had revealed it himself, Su Nantian immediately confirmed that he was merely a showy and fierce display.

But even so, Su Nantian couldn’t be careless. After all, he had once been a high-level immortal.

No matter what state he was currently in, why could he only display the strength of Qi Condensation? Perhaps he had some hidden tricks or powerful artifacts!

As the saying goes, even a lion must use all its strength when fighting a rabbit. And even if he had injuries, his strength might not be lower than Su Nantian’s—perhaps even higher.

His face still showed no concern. He also raised an aura!

Unlike Wu family’s head, whose aura was heavy and gloomy, Su Nantian's was slightly weaker but more sharp—unstoppable and relentless!

The one who felt it most clearly wasn’t anyone else, but Sun Peng, who was somewhat at a loss.

He had originally come to Wu family as an envoy of Qingyang Sect, intending to watch the situation. He hadn’t expected that Wu family’s matters were so out of his expectations, and now he had become a spectator. Although they were both watching the spectacle, the feelings were completely different.

He used to think he had everything under control. He just didn’t want to get involved. But now, the situation was completely beyond his ability. He could only watch helplessly.

Sun Peng had always thought he was a prodigy, the top among Qingyang Sect’s disciples. But now he had been overshadowed by two peers his age, which made him feel uneasy but helpless.

Wu family’s man, although he had a young body, looked like an old man. Sun Peng said nothing, but this unknown person who had suddenly appeared—how could he have such strength at his age? It seemed excessive.

Now Sun Peng felt like watching another person’s child. Unconsciously, his gaze had a touch of resentment.

Chapter 126: Ghost Claw

Feeling Su Nantian’s aura, Wu family's head became more gloomy but didn’t seem panicked. He slightly rose from his seat and looked at Su Nantian.

"Little one, you truly have impressed me. Young people are admirable, young people are admirable!"

Though he spoke with an old man’s tone, his hands moved quickly. His right hand formed a claw and immediately reached for Su Nantian’s shoulder!

As he moved, a dark black ghostly claw appeared unexpectedly behind Su Nantian, composed of death energy!

This ghostly claw was as black as ink, thin and bony. Though it was energy-formed, it looked vivid! Every joint and skin wrinkle was clearly visible!

Dark, sharp, like small knives. Its claws pointed directly at Su Nantian’s heart! Although the target was his right shoulder's death crow, this ghostly claw was huge enough to lift Su Nantian entirely, like picking up a chicken.

Seeing Wu family's head’s actions, Su Nantian let out a cold laugh. At this point, he still hadn’t revealed his true strength! What was the point of testing each other?

A dark golden sword qi spun on Su Nantian’s right fingertip and was sent directly to the ghostly claw behind. As for the claw in front, Su Nantian didn’t even pay attention to it.

Standing on his shoulder and seemingly insignificant, the death crow suddenly let out a cry. A small whirlpool appeared in its mouth and swallowed the claw as if it were a snack, seemingly tasting good and even burped.

His attack was broken, but Wu family's head didn’t seem too concerned. He merely stared at the light that had broken his ghostly claw, returning to Su Nantian’s hand. His face showed no change, but his eyes had a glint of greed!

In fact, this dark golden light was not Su Nantian’s Fuyun Sword. Fuyun Sword was his last secret weapon, how could he reveal it so easily?

This light was a self-cultivated innate sword qi! With his current Qi Condensation seventh level, he could only cultivate this one.

Although innate sword qi was slightly weaker than a flying sword, it couldn’t travel too far or be controlled flexibly. Once used, it could not be retrieved and was constantly dissipating.

But innate sword qi had one advantage that flying swords couldn’t match—cost-effectiveness! This innate sword qi was cultivated with the faith of all beings, requiring no cost at all. It was an essential tool for home travel, murder and robbery, economical and practical.

Speaking of this, he suddenly felt a bit bitter. He had once been a big shot in the immortal world, with no lack of resources. When had he ever been so desperate?

Wu family didn’t know what this light was, but he knew it was definitely a good item. In today’s Earth cultivation circle, there was no concept of innate sword qi.

What they saw as sword qi was merely a wind pressure formed after mastering sword techniques or knife techniques. It was completely different from Su Nantian’s innate sword qi.

“Little one, prepare yourself!”

Wu family's head sneered and flipped his hand. He took out an item—a bell, which was of ancient copper color. It had no clapper but made no sound in Wu family's head’s hand.

“Swirling and turning, thousands of souls! Seven essences return to their sockets, returning to my body!”

This old man took out the bell and spoke a few words to Su Nantian, then proceeded to prepare his spell without looking around.

In game terms, this was like starting a big skill.

But Su Nantian felt his head go black. Even ordinary gamers knew that when casting a big skill, one should find a safe spot.

You’re going to cast it right in front of me? Are you gambling on my remaining integrity?

As he recited the incantation, the ancient copper bell emitted a clear sound. Su Nantian felt something strange in this sound—like it was awakening something terrifying!

“I can’t let him continue. If he keeps going, I might really be defeated here!”

Deciding, Su Nantian shook his hand and sent the innate sword qi out. It flew like a flying sword straight for Wu family's head’s forehead!

His forehead had an hidden face imprint that was also flickering faintly, as if it would break out at any moment!

At the moment Su Nantian’s forehead sword imprint flickered faintly, Sun Peng felt his long sword, which had accompanied him for decades, suddenly became restless!

It seemed to have a sense of submission and emitted a soft sword sound.

Sword is the instrument of a gentleman. Its nature is to break rather than bend! Sun Peng had cultivated sword for over twenty years, believing his sword cultivation was no worse than anyone else. Even if it were the sect’s master or elders, he would one day surpass them!

So Sun Peng's sword path was a proud one. His sword was the same.

But he couldn’t imagine that today, his majestic and frosty long sword had a sense of submission. It was truly beyond his expectations.

“Hmph?”

The trembling of Sun Peng’s long sword also reached Su Nantian. He hadn’t expected that on Earth, this common iron-made weapon could still produce a divine sword embryo!

True divine swords never lack various materials. They also never lack the nurturing of various masters. What they lack is that one bit of spirit! The biggest difference between common iron and divine swords—only those who truly achieve harmony with their sword can cultivate the spirit of a divine sword!

This true spirit was simple to say. Just practice daily without interruption, and one could cultivate this spiritual essence. Perhaps anyone like Sun Peng who cultivated a sword for twenty years would be able to produce this spiritual essence.

But it was also difficult. It seemed anyone could do it, with no restrictions or requirements. But truly practicing for twenty years without interruption and keeping the sword close at all times—how many people could do that?

Su Nantian felt this common humming and felt a little envy. Such a spiritual divine sword was not easy to obtain.

Even in the immortal world, with two millennia of time, he had only obtained one. That divine sword accompanied him for countless years and blocked many dangers. Without that divine sword, there would be no Su Nantian today.

Although his thoughts were a bit scattered, Su Nantian still focused most of his attention on Wu family's head!

As the ancient copper bell swayed, more and more powerful aura appeared around him. Even Su Nantian felt a bit of fear. If he finished casting this big skill, he might really be defeated!

The dark golden innate sword qi flew like a sharp sword through the air, making a beautiful arc and heading straight for Wu family's head’s neck!

Su Nantian’s forehead sword imprint trembled. In the next moment, the flying sword left his body and aimed for the head!

But he hadn’t expected that this innate sword qi had effortlessly sliced through Wu family's head’s neck!

“You... don’t...”
