Wang Chengli quickly nodded, "I recognize him, I've seen him through my brother. But I never expected this young man to be by Tian Ge's side. Tian Ge, you... have taken him as your disciple?"

Su Nantian gave a faceless nod. Wang Chengli was stunned on the spot.

Su Nantian continued, "Since he's my man, he shouldn't be entangled in these mundane matters. I came here today to reclaim his freedom."

"If you handle this well, perhaps I'll let your head stay on your neck."

At the end, Su Nantian added, "Don't worry. This negotiation is smooth; I won't ruin the scene."

Wang Chengli smiled awkwardly, rolled up his sleeves and wiped the cold sweat from his forehead. Speaking to Su Nantian was truly nerve-wracking; one wrong word could cost him his life.

His mind was spinning.

"By the way," Su Nantian turned around and asked, "What's your brother's name?"

"Leilin," Wang Chengli answered truthfully, "My brother is good at everything except his stubbornness."

Su Nantian thought for a moment, then said, "Stubbornness isn't a problem. After a few beatings, he'll submit."

...

During the conversation, the elevator stopped at the second floor. Wang Chengli quickly stepped forward to open the door, letting Su Nantian exit.

The second floor was different from the first. The first floor was the main business area, so it was particularly noisy. However, the second floor, due to its guests, was decorated with refined taste—carved wallpaper, warm yellow corridor lights, and fragrant tulips placed every few steps. This eased Su Nantian's mood.

From the first to the second floor, Su Nantian felt as if he had entered another building because the aesthetics of these two floors were entirely different.

Wang Chengli led Su Nantian throughout, turning left and right in the corridor. Along the way, they encountered many flirtatious women who, upon seeing Su Nantian's handsome face, wanted to rush toward him. However, they were pushed away one by one by Wang Chengli beside Su Nantian.

After pushing away a woman who faked a fall to lean on Su Nantian, Wang Chengli smiled awkwardly and said, "Sorry, sorry. Isn't there an old saying that 'prostitutes love money, and girls love beauty'? These women just find you too handsome, Tian Ge."

Wang Chengli praised Su Nantian with flattery, but Su Nantian didn't take the bait.

"Let's go," Su Nantian glanced at Wang Chengli. Due to the women's previous attacks, his patience had worn thin; this decoration was truly lowbrow.

No matter how the decor was, the activities were always the same.

Wang Chengli sighed and scratched his head, closing his mouth and continuing to guide Su Nantian.

After walking for about three minutes, the two finally arrived at the door of a room on the second floor.

Su Nantian saw from afar that a group of men in black suits were patrolling outside the room, confirming that Leilin was definitely inside.

Chapter 187: What's So Extraordinary About It?

But when Su Nantian and Wang Chengli approached the door, both of their faces changed several times.

Inside the room, they could only hear some indescribable sounds—men's lewd laughter and women's seductive coos.

Su Nantian's face darkened instantly. Today's visit to Zhang Xiaojun had been a challenge to his patience. He had already endured as much as he could, but now, just before meeting him, his patience was gradually crumbling.

Wang Chengli felt even more embarrassed. Seeing Su Nantian's unfriendly expression, he forced himself to shout at the door: "Old Brother Leilin! It's already past eleven o'clock. Let's calm down and finish the matter first; there's no rush for a moment. A big person wants to see you."

Su Nantian let out a cold snort but said nothing.

But this cold snort almost made Wang Chengli wet his pants.

Wang Chengli immediately felt his legs weaken; he had truly experienced Su Nantian's terror.

To prevent this place from being further destroyed by Su Nantian, Wang Chengli decided to try again to persuade him. However, those men patrolling outside seemed to sense the danger and realized Su Nantian was not a friendly visitor. They rushed from all directions toward him.

Wang Chengli, seeing these useless and troublesome people, was even more angry.

"What are you doing? Come over here! Do your own things! Don't disturb us! I'm a good brother to your boss!" Wang Chengli vented his anger on these black-cloaked men, shouting loudly. The echo of his voice echoed through the corridor and even reached inside the room.

Su Nantian heard a woman's startled cry from within, and the room fell silent. Leilin shouted from inside: "Who's messing around outside? You don't hear me doing business! Even if the Heavenly King came, he'd have to wait outside!"

Wang Chengli had no choice but to step out and say, "It's me!"

Leilin recognized Wang Chengli's voice and resumed his affectionate behavior with the woman inside. The room once again echoed with indescribable sounds.

This time even Wang Chengli was stunned; his brother was too hasty!

He had completely failed to grasp the severity of the situation.

At this point, Su Nantian found it amusing: "Your brother knows you're outside but still indulges in pleasure. What are you waiting for?"

Wang Chengli felt awkward and wanted to persuade Su Nantian, but Su Nantian didn't give him the chance. He directly kicked open the door in front of Wang Chengli's eyes.

Two men at the door tried to attack, but Su Nantian punched them and knocked them out instantly.

In an instant, Wang Chengli was terrified and stunned. The door fell, kicking up a cloud of dust. Without the door's barrier, the scent spread into the room. A woman inside screamed, then there was the sound of rustling clothes.

The black-cloaked men quickly gathered around, although Wang Chengli had previously sent them away. However, they were directly ordered by Leilin; now that Leilin's safety was uncertain, they no longer listened to Wang Chengli's advice and surrounded Su Nantian. But they didn't attack, as if waiting for Leilin's command.

"Who are you!" Leilin, having dressed himself, glared at the door with anger.

Su Nantian glanced at Leilin; he had the same problem as the principal—his body was drained, but since Leilin exercised more than the principal, his condition was slightly better. However, compared to ordinary people, Leilin still seemed rough.

"Who are you! Daring to roam on my turf!" Leilin shouted, pointing at Su Nantian and cursing: "Today I'll let you know the meaning of 'having a life to come but no life to leave!'"

Su Nantian, upon hearing this, couldn't help but raise an eyebrow. "I've heard too many impudent words here today."

He stepped into the room and waved his hand to clear the stale air.

"I came here to talk about something with you," Su Nantian said coldly.

His voice was like clear spring water—cold yet magnetic. This alluring voice made the women inside also peek out to look at Su Nantian.

Upon seeing this, they were captivated by his appearance and remained motionless for a long time.

Leilin, seeing the woman beneath him was attracted to this young man, became even more furious and slapped her.

The woman cried out in pain and fell to the ground, knowing she was at fault, so she lowered her head without speaking.

After regaining his composure, Wang Chengli quickly stepped over the bodies of the black-cloaked men and ran to Leilin's side, anxiously grabbing his arm: "Don't provoke him, brother. Listen to what he says and what he wants; just give it to him. Don't provoke him!"

Leilin frowned and shouted, "Why?"

Wang Chengli sighed in frustration: "He's the one I told you about. He has a deep connection with Lin and is extremely powerful!"

Leilin furrowed his brows, thinking for a moment. He finally remembered—his good friend Wang Chengli had been ruined by this Su Nantian. At that moment, Leilin's hatred for Su Nantian reached a new peak.

"I definitely won't let him go!" Leilin seemed to disregard Su Nantian's background, which shocked Wang Chengli.

"I'll say it again: I came here to talk about something with you. I've set my eyes on Zhang Xiaojun. I'm here to take him. I hope he won't be involved with you anymore; otherwise..." Su Nantian was impatient, wanting to get rid of these annoying matters and leave this smoky place.

Leilin heard this and laughed bitterly, "I say kid, who gave you the face to come here and take my man?"

"I told you, Zhang Xiaojun isn't mine. He's already signed a contract with us. You're my life!"

Incidentally, he also wanted to take revenge for the injury caused by Su Nantian's destruction of his place.

Wang Chengli heard Leilin mention his name again and became even more anxious: "Big brother, I don't want to take revenge. Just listen to me and don't fight with Su Nantian!"

Leilin, after a while of thinking, said: "Why can't we fight with this person? He entered my place and touched my people, even kicked down my door!"

Leilin's eyes were wide with anger. He pointed at the broken door on the ground and said: "Look, this is bullying me directly. Do you expect me to endure it?"

Seeing Leilin's anger, the black-cloaked men thought Su Nantian was doomed. They tightened their circle around him.

Chapter 188: Unwilling!

Leilin highly valued his group of black-cloaked men. He had carefully cultivated them for crucial moments. He rubbed his nose and smiled proudly, observing Su Nantian among the black-cloaked men.

Su Nantian was also quite impatient. He looked around the room and finally saw a clock on the opposite wall.

Su Nantian checked the time, which had already reached twelve o'clock. He frowned slightly, worrying about his three women at home still waiting for him to return.

As he was thinking this, Su Nantian's phone in his pocket rang with a message alert. He quickly pulled it out and glanced at the screen. The message was from Lin Suyun: "Nantian, have you finished your business outside? Please sleep early; don't stay up late."

Su Nantian felt warm. His long fingers quickly typed a message: "Not yet, I don't know when I'll finish. Sleep early; don't stay up."

A moment later, Lin Suyun's reply came: "Okay, we won't stay up late. Don't worry about home."

Staring at the screen reflecting a glowing light, Su Nantian was deeply moved. This warmth had never been felt in the immortal realm for twenty thousand years. He carefully put his phone back into his pocket and prepared to deal with the current situation.

Su Nantian had no patience for these people outside as he did at home. He had wasted too much time in this bar, which made him very annoyed. Now, Su Nantian was like a lion that had just awakened, looking down on the black-cloaked men with cold eyes.

They were all just chickens and dogs.

This cold gaze was completely different from the one he had when replying to messages.

Even Leilin was stunned, and he slowly exhaled, thinking about how to deal with Su Nantian.

Su Nantian ignored the black-cloaked men in front of him, even without moving his hand to push them away. The black-cloaked men were oppressed by Su Nantian's aura and unconsciously made a path for him.

"I said it once, from now on, Zhang Xiaojun has no connection with your bar. Otherwise, you'll be closing down." Su Nantian walked to a sofa and sat down.

Leilin observed Su Nantian's transformation and naturally understood that Su Nantian was indeed a formidable person. He turned to Wang Chengli with an expression, as if asking: "Is this man really not worth provoking?"

Wang Chengli was a long-time good friend of Leilin, so he understood every gesture and expression.

At that moment, Wang Chengli quickly nodded and, fearing Leilin might do something unexpected, whispered to him: "If Su Nantian only had Lin's background, it would be okay. Even if you provoked him, you might escape with your life. But the most terrifying thing about Su Nantian is his hidden strength..."

Leilin felt a sense of unease and quickly looked at Wang Chengli's expression to see if he was lying. However, Wang Chengli's face was serious and not joking at all.

Leilin now felt a headache; Su Nantian had entered his place and attacked his people without hesitation. Now he wanted to take Zhang Xiaojun from Leilin's hands. If he agreed, wouldn't it make the bar's brothers mock him to death?

But Su Nantian's strength was undeniable. If he really overturned the place, it would be even harder to save face.

Leilin now felt a headache; his large pores were twisted in confusion. Suddenly, he remembered something and a sly look flashed across his eyes.

He also stepped forward and sat beside Su Nantian, then changed to a "meeting with regret" smile: "Su brother, right? Your strength is truly not to be underestimated! That aura just now!" Leilin turned and looked at Wang Chengli, "Right?"

Wang Chengli understood the meaning and followed: "Yes, yes. Our Tian Ge's strength is this." Wang Chengli showed a thumbs-up.

Su Nantian didn't fall for it and still coldly looked at the two, saying: "Did I need to say that again?"

Leilin's expression instantly froze and then softened into a smile: "Su brother, joking. It's just a subordinate. Let's put that aside for now. Brother I have a big money-making matter to discuss with Su brother..."

"I'm not interested." Su Nantian impatiently interrupted.

Wang Chengli also didn't understand what Leilin was up to, so he stayed silent.

"Don't be uninterested. Brother, look at it this way: everyone wants to make money. Now this opportunity is in front of you, and if you don't take it, the money will go to others." Leilin continued to persuade.

Su Nantian wasn't someone who lacked money, and he definitely didn't want to do business with Leilin. But Leilin still kept talking, trying to convince Su Nantian.

"This business is also beneficial for you, right? Are you still in college?"

"Master Tian is at Fengyue University," Wang Chengli quickly interjected.

"Fengyue University is great! Let's open a bar near Fengyue University, how about that? After the students finish their classes, they can come to our bar and relax!"

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian's impatience turned into disgust. Leilin continued to imagine: "Then that bar would be a branch, brother provides the capital, and you can be the assistant manager or something. Watch over the place! Go inside the student body to gather information! Let's make money together, how about that!" Saying this, Leilin tried to be friendly by putting his arm around Su Nantian's shoulder.

But Su Nantian quickly pushed down Leilin's arm and coldly asked: "Are you trying to lure those students into the bar?"

Leilin was stunned, then laughed: "How can you say that? We're providing a place for the students to relax!"

"I've already thought of the name. Let's open this bar together, call it 'Tianlei'! How about that, brother!"

Su Nantian coldly snorted: "Look at what kind of activities are going on in your bar. Opening one near a school, how many talents will you ruin!"

The atmosphere in the room instantly became extremely awkward. Wang Chengli's heart was pounding like a drum, almost jumping out of his throat. Leilin also narrowed his eyes and erased the smile on his face, saying coldly: "So what you mean is, you don't want to do business with me?"

Chapter 189: Shadow Guards

Su Nantian raised an eyebrow, his eyes filled with contempt. "What you're doing is not worthy of me to do business with."

This statement was like throwing a big stone into calm water, instantly causing waves. Leilin shouted and stood up, yelling: "Su! You're giving me face! Don't take it for granted. I don't care if you know Lin's family or not. You won't leave this bar today!"

Wang Chengli was shocked and quickly rushed to stop Leilin's anger: "Brother, listen to me. Just agree with Su Nantian's request and let him go!" Wang Chengli had fought with Su Nantian before, so he naturally knew that Su Nantian's patience was now exhausted. If they didn't comply with Su Nantian's wishes, the bar would surely be in trouble.

But Leilin was now furious and didn't listen to Wang Chengli's words at all. He waved his hand and threw Wang Chengli to the ground, colliding with the woman immediately. Both of them let out a "Oh!" sound. Wang Chengli now felt his vision swimming and was trying to shake off the dizziness.

"Brothers, go out!" Leilin shouted loudly, but Su Nantian's mouth twitched. What a twist.

The next moment, the black-cloaked men immediately retreated from the room like fleeing a disaster. Their footsteps echoed through the corridor until they were barely audible.

Su Nantian now felt something was strange, but he wasn't afraid at all. With his strength, he could deal with any situation. Seeing Su Nantian's expression hadn't changed, Leilin let out a mocking sneer and thought Su Nantian was just an overconfident young man.

"Shadows! Capture this person!" Leilin shouted again, which woke up Wang Chengli who was on the ground. Upon hearing Leilin wanted to call out his shadows, Wang Chengli quickly rushed forward and stopped Leilin: "Why won't you listen to my advice? It's still not too late! Just agree with his request!"

Wang Chengli was anxious like a ant on a hot pan, constantly persuading Leilin. But Leilin didn't listen to a single word.

"Why would I let him go? Where is my face!" Leilin waved his hand again, and Wang Chengli staggered backward a few steps and almost fell.

But outside the door, ten strong men entered like ghosts, each wearing half a mask covering their faces below the eyes.

As they stepped into the room, they deliberately released their pressure, and a wave of heat rushed toward everyone. Su Nantian, however, didn't even bother to look at them.

A group of people with Cultivation Level Five, although already very strong in this world, and with their numbers, they could easily win by overwhelming. This made Su Nantian even more contemptuous.

Leilin looked at his ten men with pressure that couldn't be controlled, and a smile involuntarily appeared on his lips. These were Leilin's secret weapons; now he had called them out to deal with Su Nantian, and he was sure they would either kill or injure him.

Leilin glanced at Wang Chengli, his eyes seemed to say: "See how I avenge you."

Wang Chengli secretly thought it was bad, but now the situation had reached a point where Leilin and he were both stuck. Wang Chengli could only pray that these ten shadows would deal with Su Nantian, otherwise he and Leilin wouldn't be safe.

These ten people called "shadows" were obviously well-fed and raised by Leilin, each resembling Leilin's arrogant and disrespectful attitude. This made Su Nantian even more determined to eliminate them for the people.

In Su Nantian's eyes, these ten people combined were not even enough to fill his mouth.

"Attack him! Hit him hard! Kill him!" Leilin was so upset by Su Nantian's calmness that he couldn't bear it and felt some unease. So he quickly ordered his strong subordinates to deal with Su Nantian early on.

These ten people were well-trained and knew how to use their pressure.

They quickly surrounded Su Nantian and released their pressure to crush him. Within three seconds of releasing the pressure, Leilin and Wang Chengli could no longer stand and their legs trembled.

The two brothers quickly stepped back a few steps, away from this pressure zone of Cultivation Level Five.

But no one expected that Su Nantian remained calm and stood in the circle, as if the pressure was just air to him.

This made Leilin extremely anxious. He jumped in place and shouted: "What are you still waiting for! Attack!"

Although the ten Cultivation Level Five shadows were confused about why Su Nantian wasn't affected, they had to attack since their boss said so.

At that moment, one of the shadows shouted and directed all his energy into his fist, then swung it at Su Nantian. Su Nantian let out a cold snort and quickly wrapped his hand around the fist, which had so much pressure that it caused the air to ripple.

The shadow was stunned and tried to pull back his fist, but found himself unable to move. Su Nantian imitated the man's actions and wrapped his fist with energy, then punched it into the shadow's stomach. The man flew out like a broken rag and crashed against the wall, creating a large dent.

The other nine shadows thought it was bad and guessed that Su Nantian must be a Cultivation Level Five person. They immediately adopted the strategy of nine attacks on one and rushed toward Su Nantian together.

Su Nantian let out a cold laugh, his body instantly moving like light around these shadows. The shadows couldn't react in time and were hit by punches on both sides, falling to the ground.

Within a few minutes, those ten shadows who had previously stood proudly were now all lying on the ground, groaning.

Su Nantian rubbed his wrists as if playing a trick, then released his pressure like a warrior descending from the heavens.

From Cultivation Level Five to Six, then Seven. The shadows on the ground were further injured by the pressure and finally fainted.

After the shadows fainted, Su Nantian collected his rising pressure.

He looked back at Leilin and Wang Chengli, who were huddled in the corner. His contempt was even more intense.

At this moment, Leilin no longer cared about what Su Nantian thought of him. The fight between Su Nantian and the shadows had made Leilin realize his gap with Su Nantian. These shadows were hired by Leilin over the years, and their strength was undeniable; each of them was above Cultivation Level Five. With this group of mercenaries, Leilin had never suffered any losses in Fengcheng.

Chapter 190: Begging for Mercy

These people were like wooden figures, only blocking for a moment without causing any harm.

This was definitely not because they were weak but because Su Nantian was too strong.

He had personally witnessed their strength; several renowned international assassins had fallen at their hands.

And tonight, this Su Nantian who had never been heard of before had defeated Leilin's powerful mercenaries within minutes, and these shadows hadn't even managed to get close to Su Nantian!

Thinking about this, Leilin suddenly felt a chill down his back. He had severely underestimated Su Nantian's strength.

Leilin trembled, relying on Wang Chengli to support him. He was now full of regret and looked at Wang Chengli with a resentful gaze.

This was good, both had now torn their faces off and didn't know if there was any chance to reconcile.

He feared Su Nantian would make him disappear from Fengcheng!

At first, he thought Wang Chengli was just talking nonsense. Now it seemed very likely to be true.

So, with Su Nantian's revealed strength and the people behind him, he believed Su Nantian could do it!

And no one would find any fault with him, even if he was killed on the spot, no one would avenge him.

Wang Chengli wasn't much better; his heart was full of tears, constantly blaming Leilin for not listening to his advice. Now they had this situation, Wang Chengli was afraid and almost cried.

"Ti... Tian Ge... please spare us!" Wang Chengli staggered forward and fell to his knees beside Su Nantian. He didn't dare to pull at Su Nantian's clothes, so he lowered his head and pleaded: "Tian Ge! This time it was a misunderstanding. Please, Tian Ge! And this matter has nothing to do with me at all."

Wang Chengli thought of the scenes before and the lesson Su Nantian had given him, all filled with fear. He thought it would be an indelible shadow in his life.

Wang Chengli called Su Nantian "Tian Ge" repeatedly, which also alerted Leilin who was still fearful.

Leilin quickly rushed over and fell to his knees at Su Nantian's feet, begging: "Tian Ge! I didn't mean to!" Leilin slapped himself hard, causing half his face to swell: "Tian Ge! Please forgive me this time!"

The two people on the ground begged for mercy, and Su Nantian looked at them with contempt. He then kicked a little distance away.

"I said I came here to talk about something with you. There's an old saying that 'things don't happen three times.' So, are you going to make me say it a third time?" Su Nantian said coldly. He looked down on these people without principles, who were afraid of the strong and bullied the weak.

This statement was like a revelation to Leilin, who quickly shook his head: "No no no, Tian Ge, you can take whoever you want! I have no objections!"

Su Nantian said: "I'm not here to steal people, just to take Zhang Xiaojun."

"Take it! Take it! Tian Ge, whoever you want to take, just take them. And these women here, Tian Ge can choose freely." Wang Chengli and Leilin quickly flattered, fearing Su Nantian would destroy the bar.

"Women, you can keep them yourselves. But you must ensure these people are willing to come here. If there's any forced selling, the consequences should be clear. Since you've agreed, from today on, Zhang Xiaojun has no connection with this bar." Su Nantian said.

Leilin trembled all over, his voice shaking. He thought of the new arrivals he hadn't tasted yet and felt a chill in his heart.

He trembled while nodding: "Yes yes yes, I remember, from today on Zhang Xiaojun has no connection with this bar..."

Su Nantian impatiently rubbed his temples and interrupted: "No need to repeat, it's too noisy."

After saying this, Su Nantian kicked away the people on the ground blocking his path and walked out by himself.

The group of black-cloaked men at the end of the corridor saw Su Nantian walking out unscathed, all shocked and dared not approach him, fearing they would disturb Su Nantian.

Su Nantian glanced at the people who were huddled together and shook his head. He hated these subordinates most; they ate well and drank well, but could be used anywhere. Now that Leilin's place was destroyed, these black-cloaked men were also just huddling together for warmth.

Su Nantian took out his phone and called Zhang Xiaojun. The call was answered quickly, and Zhang Xiaojun said: "Tian Ge, I've already arranged for Zhu Ying. But her condition seems very bad. Where are you now? Should I come to find you?"

"I'm on the second floor of the bar," Su Nantian said.

"You don't need to come get me. I'm at the door of Leilin's room now. Tell me, where should I go next?"

Zhang Xiaojun thought for a moment and said: "Go straight to your right, then turn right at the first fork. Go all the way and you'll reach it. The room number is 'Fragrant Women.'"

Upon hearing this name, Su Nantian's mouth twitched. "Okay, I'll come over later."

After hanging up the phone, Su Nantian followed Zhang Xiaojun's directions and walked to the right.

The black-cloaked men saw Su Nantian leaving and quickly ran one after another to Leilin's room. They were shocked by the scene—this bar's pride, the shadows, were all lying on the ground with blood spilling out. Leilin and Wang Chengli, along with the previous woman, were all pale as if they had lost their souls.

...

A few minutes later, Su Nantian successfully arrived at the door of this "Fragrant Women" room. He tapped his finger on it, and Zhang Xiaojun opened the door from inside.

"Tian Ge," Zhang Xiaojun made space for him, and Su Nantian walked in. This room was used for men's and women's pleasures, so the entrance had a large pink bed. At this moment, Zhu Ying was lying on it with her back to Su Nantian, as if she were asleep.

Zhang Xiaojun quickly explained: "This Zhu Ying lady doesn't speak, and she's been silent and crying. She just fell asleep."

Su Nantian's mouth twitched, asking: "Why did you choose such a room?"

Zhang Xiaojun felt委屈 (disappointed): "All the rooms in this bar are like this. I chose the best one I could."

"Okay," Su Nantian said: "You've worked hard. Your matter has been resolved. From today on, you have no connection with this bar; you'll follow me."

"Ah?" Zhang Xiaojun was surprised and widened his eyes: "Why are you going alone? Are you injured? I thought you were coming to get me."

Su Nantian could see Zhang Xiaojun's concern was genuine, so he patted his shoulder to comfort him: "I'm faster alone. I'm not injured. Okay, don't let Zhang Mengyao be afraid at home. It's this late; you should go back."

Chapter 191: Wishes

"Ah, it's so late. My sister must be waiting at home," Zhang Xiaojun checked the time, slapped his forehead and prepared to leave but turned back and asked: "Tian Ge, when are you going back?"

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian first looked at Zhu Ying on the bed, thought for a moment and said: "I'll wait until she wakes up and confirms she's okay, then I'll go back."

Zhang Xiaojun quickly showed a look of surprise: "I didn't expect Tian Ge to have such a gentle side."

Su Nantian crossed his arms and turned to look at Zhang Xiaojun. That calm gaze made Zhang Xiaojun swallow hard: "Tian Ge, I'll go now."

After saying this, Zhang Xiaojun was about to leave, but Su Nantian grabbed his collar and said: "What's the rush? I'll send you to the door."

Zhang Xiaojun quickly waved his hands, trying to refuse. However, Su Nantian tightened his wrist and without hesitation pulled Zhang Xiaojun out, then threw him outside. After that, Zhang Xiaojun quickly closed the door.

Outside, Zhang Xiaojun sighed and rubbed his nose, then went back home.

When Su Nantian returned to the bed, Zhu Ying had already woken up and was sitting on the edge of the bed, staring at Su Nantian. Su Nantian was also stunned and sat down, gently asking: "Are you okay?"

Zhu Ying seemed to be in a trance. After a while, she started crying again.

Su Nantian was stunned and immediately panicked: "What's wrong with you? Teacher? Why are you crying?"

He had no way to deal with women's tears.

Zhu Ying continued to cry without answering Su Nantian. This made Su Nantian feel helpless; it was easy to deal with the ten shadows, but he had no idea how to handle this woman. Zhu Ying cried so hard that Su Nantian didn't know what to do.

"You're my nemesis, why am I always so unlucky with you... sobbing..." Zhu Ying kept wiping her tears, but the tears still flowed like they were free.

Su Nantian was impatient and rubbed his hair, taking a deep breath before saying: "I just saved you, right? Why are you turning on me and biting back? What did I do to you?"

Zhu Ying cried again: "Where isn't it bad for me? Where is it bad for me! I just met you, and because of you, the principal reprimanded me and my parents reprimanded me! I've never experienced this before!"

"Yes, the principal wanted to flirt with you. How could he reprimand you? This time if I hadn't threatened him, he wouldn't have reprimanded you. My mistake." Su Nantian spoke bluntly.

"Then at night, I was dragged on the ground and beaten... Why couldn't you come earlier! If you had come earlier, I wouldn't have been so embarrassed!" Zhu Ying shouted.

Su Nantian pinched his nose and comforted: "I saw you already lying on the ground when I walked in. I wanted to come earlier, but there's no such thing as knowing beforehand, right?"

Zhu Ying was stunned and stopped crying but sniffled twice. Then she said: "Then today afternoon, my boyfriend broke up with me... If I had known... I wouldn't have been with him!" After saying this, Zhu Ying couldn't control her crying again: "Why did you break up with me... I don't know what I did wrong!"

Su Nantian had a headache. At this moment, he really wanted to grab Zhu Ying's boyfriend and force him to get back together with her.

"Okay, don't cry anymore. There will be better people waiting for you in the future." Su Nantian thought hard, using all the lines he had seen from soap operas at home.

Zhu Ying managed to stop crying but still sniffled: "Men always say this. When they pursued me, they said I was their princess. After a while, they said there would be better people to match me... sobbing..."

Su Nantian suddenly took a deep breath and thought: "Oops, I chose the wrong lines."

"Before, men who treated me like a princess all left. You say, am I still a princess?" Zhu Ying asked with tears in her eyes because of the alcohol. She stared at Su Nantian, looking for an answer.

Su Nantian sighed and said: "You will be."

"Who?" Zhu Ying quickly asked.

Su Nantian had a little sweat on his forehead because of this topic, wishing he could slap himself.

"Who knows now, but eventually there will be..."
