"Ha ha!"
Everyone burst into laughter.
No one gave him any face, all of them laughing at him openly.
At this moment, A Hao could only endure his anger in silence, forcing a sheepish smile and daring not to express his resentment.
"Enough talk. We need to press the attack and capture Su Nantian quickly."
At this moment, Long Ge spoke up to defuse the situation, stopping others from mocking A Hao further. He then looked at A Hao and said, "You said he was in Xiao Yu Cun, right? Lead the way quickly."
Long Ge soon revealed their purpose for returning. Originally, they had planned to search themselves, but after taking a few steps, A Chuan suddenly stopped and said that since A Hao knew where Su Nantian was and had already met him, it would be better to bring him along as well. That way, they could handle any situation that arose. Moreover, they were also worried that A Hao might spread the news around, making it unsafe.
After considering all these factors, they decided to return and bring A Hao along as well.
"Me? I... I have to go too?"
A Hao was startled by Long Ge's words and could barely speak coherently.
He furrowed his brows, feeling worried. He had told Long Ge and the others about Su Nantian's whereabouts to avoid having to go himself or interact with Su Nantian directly.
But now, it seemed they were bringing him along as well.
If Su Nantian saw him, wouldn't he be doomed?
After thinking it through, A Hao felt reluctant.
Moreover, he was already regretting his decision, wishing he hadn't meddled and told them the news. At the very least, he could have begged for mercy and waited for them to let him go.
Or perhaps after telling them the news, he should have fled quickly so they wouldn't catch him.
But now, they had surrounded him completely. Even if A Hao was unwilling, he could only comply with them.
"What? I get the feeling you're not very willing,"
A Chuan noticed A Hao's hesitation and sneered, placing his hand on the side of his waist.
His gesture clearly indicated he was about to draw his weapon.
Upon seeing A Chuan also preparing to reveal his weapon, A Hao's will to survive immediately surged.
"No no, I'm just worried my clumsy hands might slow you down! I have absolutely no intention of being reluctant!"
A Hao quickly explained, cleverly shifting all the blame onto himself.
"If you're willing to use me, I'm more than happy to serve!"
A Hao smiled again with his usual fawning expression. At this point, if he angered them, wouldn't all his efforts be in vain?
At the very least, after leading them there, he would play the role of a turtle and say nothing, make no sound.
If these people failed, he would beg for mercy again and shift all the blame onto them.
A Hao had thought through this carefully, feeling he no longer needed to fear them.
"Hmph! You're wise."
A Chuan sneered, but wasn't too angry. He knew A Hao had deflected the issue well, so he didn't argue with him further.
"Now that we've brought you along, it's your fortune. You'd better follow us obediently! And remember to stay quiet; we don't want you talking, so keep your mouths shut tightly!"
A Chuan continued to lecture A Hao, his words carrying threats and warnings.
"Ah, you don't need to interfere with the rest of it. Just do what we've assigned you."
Long Ge spoke up again, but this time his words also indicated they felt it necessary to bring A Hao along.
A Chuan nodded in agreement: "Exactly! When have we ever let you give orders? Just listen to us!"
After saying this, A Chuan cast a disdainful glance at A Hao. If it weren't for Long Ge's presence, he would have drawn his weapon to teach A Hao a lesson immediately, preventing him from making excuses and resisting.
"Yes! Yes! I remember!"
When A Hao heard this, he knew there was no escape. He could only obediently respond.
But his heart was filled with resentment and dissatisfaction, and he strongly disagreed with their arrangement.
Yet there was nothing he could do—after all, who else could fight against so many people?
At this point, he was the one on the chopping block. There was no way for him to resist.
So, he could only obediently lead Long Ge and the others out toward Xiao Yu Cun to deal with Su Nantian.
A Hao could only silently pray that these people were reliable and strong, otherwise his life would truly be lost with them.
"Stupid kid! What kind of expression is that? Are you looking down on us?"
A Chuan spoke out in dissatisfaction, casting a scornful glance at A Hao as if even looking at him would be painful.
He disliked A Hao, thinking he was a coward and a burden.
So he kept a close watch on A Hao throughout the journey, immediately noticing any strange behavior and mocking or ridiculing him.
Now seeing A Hao's odd expression, A Chuan immediately started to harass him again.
He made no effort to let A Hao off the hook.
It was unclear whether A Chuan and A Hao had a bad relationship or if he found it amusing to constantly target A Hao.
Long Ge and the others had been quietly walking, but upon hearing A Chuan's words, they all frowned and turned to look at A Hao.
Was this stupid kid really daring to look down on us?
Thinking of this, their eyes toward A Hao were also very unfriendly, with no emotion at all, as if A Hao would be dealt with immediately should he make a single mistake.
"Is that the case?"
Long Ge spoke coldly, his tone full of threats. If A Hao dared to answer affirmatively, they would not let him off.
The others didn't speak but all glared at A Hao threateningly.
"No no, I definitely didn't think that! I wouldn't dare to!"
A Hao cursed inwardly but kept his expression calm.
He knew it was true!

Chapter 815: Threats
"I definitely didn't think that!"
A Hao quickly begged for mercy, lowering his voice to apologize repeatedly.
A Chuan was a troublemaker who couldn't stand him, always targeting him and constantly belittling him.
After thinking about this, A Hao felt even more resentful.
But he was aware that he couldn't oppose these people. If he angered them again, he would definitely be in trouble, while they would have no problems at all.
"Brothers, calm down! I really didn't think that!"
A Hao again begged for mercy and apologized, cowering low, but inwardly cursed A Chuan a hundred times.
"Enough, A Chuan. Don't cause trouble unnecessarily."
Long Ge was fair-minded and warned A Chuan: "He'll need to lead us to Xiao Yu Cun, so what if you scare him?"
"He's not a porcelain doll; scaring him won't break him."
A Chuan was upset by Long Ge's warning, but when he met Long Ge's eyes, he quickly backed down: "I understand, Long Ge."
But at this moment, A Chuan still glared at A Hao as if all the blame was on him.
Receiving this glance, A Hao was utterly shocked and felt extremely wronged.
He didn't know why he had specifically attracted this troublemaker, who constantly targeted him!
"Also, A Hao, be obedient and don't provoke A Chuan."
At this moment, Long Ge turned to warn A Hao. Both sides received equal punishment without bias, but neither of them felt good.
"Yes, Long Ge, I would never dare to oppose A Chuan."
But A Hao could only reluctantly answer Long Ge, pretending to be fully cooperative.
"Sniveler."
A Chuan muttered under his breath, but after receiving Long Ge's warning glance, he quickly shut up and didn't say anything else.
The other four people had always believed in the saying "silence is golden," and they hadn't spoken much. They also listened to Long Ge carefully, following his instructions throughout the journey.
Now that A Chuan had been warned by Long Ge, he was also quieted down a bit. They were quieter on the journey and no longer made other noises.
A Hao was relieved that A Chuan hadn't continued to target him and had stopped hounding him, so he secretly took a breath of relief.
At least for now, he could be slightly more at ease.
They continued toward Xiao Yu Cun. Since it was all mountain paths and a remote village, they walked quite difficultly.
But fortunately, they were just exploring the path and confirming Su Nantian's identity this time, so there was no rush.
"Ugh!"
Throughout the journey, they had been peaceful, but A Chuan occasionally made a few complaints about the difficult mountain path. However, after being warned by Long Ge, he was much more obedient.
At this moment, A Hao accidentally stepped on a loose stone and stumbled forward. In desperation, his hand quickly grabbed something in front of him but was surprised to find he had grasped a hard object.
The shape, the hardness...
A Hao was stunned and looked up in disbelief at A Chuan and others, his eyes full of fear.
They had guns!
A Hao's heart was pounding rapidly. He only now realized how lucky he had been; if he had accidentally offended them, he would have been shot dead immediately!
"This... this..."
A Hao swallowed his saliva and tried to explain, wanting to say he knew nothing. But at this moment, his throat felt as if it had been stuffed with cotton and he couldn't speak.
"Be quiet."
A Chuan frowned and warned him.
This time even Long Ge changed his expression: "Keep your mouth shut; don't let me hear a sound from you."
Long Ge coldly warned, then收回 his gaze.
A Hao nodded rapidly. Even without their warning, he would never dare to make any noise again.
It was a gun!
Not just any sword or knife; if shot, one would be dead on the spot with no chance for rescue!
A Hao was now doubtful. He had always thought these people weren't ordinary, but now it seemed they were no good at all!
He didn't know who Su Nantian had offended, but it was clear they had sent such powerful people to deal with him.
A Hao had been very afraid and was highly tense before.
But now, thinking about Su Nantian, he gradually relaxed.
He had been worried before that Long Ge and the others coming here were just cannon fodder who couldn't handle Su Nantian. But now he could be at ease.
These people had big guns!
Even if Su Nantian was so strong, could he be a wall of iron?
He was still flesh and blood!
After thinking this through, A Hao's expression became轻松 again.
It seemed that tonight was Su Nantian's day of death!
Originally, A Hao had been very upset and angry that they forced him to come along. But now it seemed watching Su Nantian be killed by them was a good thing!
A Hao's heart beat faster again.
If he had been constantly worried before, hoping Xiao Yu Cun was far away so he could calm down gradually.
Now A Hao wished he had wings to fly quickly to Xiao Yu Cun, watching Long Ge and the others deal with Su Nantian. It would be a good revenge for him!
"Are you daydreaming? Walk faster! You were told to lead the way, right?"
A Hao was thinking about things and his steps slowed unconsciously. At this moment, A Chuan, who was next to him, frowned and scolded him impatiently.
"Ah! Ah! Yes! I'll speed up!"
A Hao's attitude was very good, and he didn't dare to resist or show any resistance.
And this time, his response was quick and voluntary. After saying it, A Hao indeed sped up and hurriedly led Long Ge and the others.
Hmph! Su Nantian, tonight is your day of death!
Get ready for that!
On the other hand, Su Nantian, who was being watched by A Hao and others, was currently identifying the effects of herbs in Xiao Yu Cun. He had no idea that someone was coming to trouble him, and these people were already on the way.
"Wang Ge!"
While identifying herbs, Su Nantian heard someone knocking heavily on the door. The person outside seemed very urgent and their voice was also anxious.
"Coming!"
Su Nantian quickly replied.
Chapter 816: Fever
"Be right there."
Su Nantian said again, calming the person outside.
This was a common occurrence for him since he became the only doctor in Xiao Yu Cun.
People coming to knock on the door at night were also common.
After all, illness was beyond human control and no one could limit his time.
"What's the matter?"
Su Nantian quickly opened the door and asked calmly.
"It's Hu Zi! He went up the mountain with my father today, fell down, and suddenly developed a high fever. He's talking nonsense! We gave him two bowls of herbal medicine, but it didn't work!"
The person hurriedly explained the situation. The "herbal medicine" he mentioned was their village's traditional method passed down through generations.
Su Nantian had checked it before and found the herbs were fine, mild and nourishing, so they continued to use this herbal medicine.
"I see. You go back first; I'll get ready and come over."
Su Nantian calmly arranged, always remaining composed.
His calmness also calmed the person, who gradually relaxed and wasn't so tense anymore.
"Ah! Ah! I'll wait for you to come with me."
The person nodded and replied, then said to Su Nantian: "It's too dark; I brought a flashlight."
"Good."
This was a remote village with electricity only in recent years, so there were no streetlights. And once it got dark, everyone went to sleep with their lights on.
Although Su Nantian's eyes were different from ordinary people and he could see clearly at night, this was a kind gesture. Su Nantian didn't refuse it either.
Soon, he gathered some necessary herbs and organized some useful items, then hurried to Hu Zi's house.
"How is he doing now?"
As soon as Su Nantian arrived, Hu Zi's family rushed out to surround him.
"Wang Shenyi (Master Wang), please come in and check quickly! Hu Zi, this child..."
Hu Zi's father said this, then sighed. His wife covered her face and cried, heartbroken.
"Don't worry; I'll go in first."
Su Nantian frowned and comforted them, then hurried inside.
Inside, he saw Hu Zi lying in bed, his face flushed and sweating profusely. As they said, the child was suffering from pain and kept talking nonsense.
"Hu Zi! Hu Zi?"
Seeing this, Su Nantian frowned and took a step forward to check Hu Zi's body.
At this moment, Su Nantian also softly called out Hu Zi's name to see if he was conscious.
But Hu Zi's consciousness wasn't clear at all; he didn't respond at all and seemed to have heard nothing.
Su Nantian frowned again, then touched Hu Zi's forehead and found it was indeed hot. Hu Zi was also unconscious, constantly muttering, but Su Nantian couldn't hear what he was saying.
"His condition isn't good."
Su Nantian truthfully told Hu Zi's family, his face also showing some concern.
If it were just a simple fever, why would this happen?
They had all taken the medicine before. The people in Xiao Yu Cun had used this herbal medicine for generations, and Hu Zi had taken it as a child. There was no allergy or other issues.
But it still didn't work, and his condition was getting worse.
After thinking this through, Su Nantian made another decision.
"Should we use these to wipe his body? It might be effective!"
At this moment, Hu Zi's father stepped forward and suggested, also very anxious.
He had heard of this method from others when he went fishing; it was to use alcohol to wipe the child's whole body and let him cool down.
Su Nantian heard this but shook his head, interrupting Hu Zi's father: "It's not that simple."
He felt there was something else. Hu Zi wasn't just a fever.
"Where did he fall?"
Su Nantian asked.
"This child went up the mountain with me and fell by accident. I told him not to come, but he insisted on coming. Ah!"
At this point, Hu Zi's father started to blame himself: "It was my fault. He's still young; he shouldn't have gone up the mountain to run around!"
"Father Hu, it's not the time for this."
Su Nantian interrupted Hu Zi's father and continued to check Hu Zi's body.
Su Nantian had originally wanted to check his current temperature, so he touched his forehead and felt a small bump.
He was stunned and traced it upward, finding three or four more swollen bumps.
It seemed this was the main reason for Hu Zi's unconsciousness and high fever.
"Did he get stung by a wasp?"
Su Nantian directly asked, stating his guess.
In villages like Xiao Yu Cun, there were many wasps and various insects.
If he had been stung by a wasp, everything would make sense now, and the situation could be explained.
"This... this is impossible? Hu Zi didn't complain at all today, and if he had been stung by a wasp, why hadn't he reacted?"
Hu Zi's father was stunned and looked at Su Nantian in confusion.
"Look here."
Su Nantian interrupted Hu Zi's father and directly indicated for him to come closer, letting him see clearly.
Hu Zi's father came over and saw that it was indeed a wasp sting.
He was shocked: "Oh my! It's really so many stings!"
Wasps were very venomous! Just one sting was painful, and Hu Zi had been stung so many times. He was truly pitiable!
"Now is not the time to talk about this; you need to prepare and send him to the hospital immediately."
Su Nantian quickly instructed, interrupting Hu Zi's father's sorrow.
This was a big deal that couldn't be taken lightly, and it couldn't be ignored either.
The environment here was too primitive; if they stayed longer, Su Nantian also worried about Hu Zi's safety.
Therefore, the immediate priority was to send Hu Zi to the hospital for treatment; that was the best way.
If they delayed, it would be a problem.
"Quickly! The child can't wait!"
Su Nantian hurried out, and after saying this, he immediately had them prepare.
He didn't wait for their opinions but directly picked up Hu Zi and went out.
Hu Zi's father and mother followed quickly, not daring to delay.
They heard Su Nantian say this and knew the situation was serious. After experiencing so much, the villagers of Xiao Yu Cun had long regarded Su Nantian as their guardian.
They would absolutely believe what they said and do exactly as instructed.
They hurried out like this, but no one knew that just as they left Xiao Yu Cun, a group of fierce people arrived.
They clearly came with hostile intentions.
Moreover, these people made a lot of noise; upon arriving, they woke up the villagers of Xiao Yu Cun.
At this time, everyone should have been asleep early, but upon hearing the noise outside, the villagers all got out of their beds and hurried to check what had happened.
In an instant, Xiao Yu Cun became lively; the villagers who got up were chattering and discussing what had happened.
"Again you? A Hao!"
The old village head, leaning on a cane, stood at the front. Seeing this group of strong people, he was also startled.
When he saw that the person at the front was A Hao, his eyebrows immediately furrowed and he glared at A Hao with suspicion.
This guy was really persistent! Why was he always involved in everything?
"Did you forget Wang Li's warning? How dare you step into our village again!"
The old village head warned him loudly, then pounded his cane heavily to drive A Hao away: "You know Wang Li's abilities and temper. If you're wise, leave now! Otherwise, don't blame us for not giving you face!"
The old village head again warned A Hao, telling him to take these people out of Xiao Yu Cun.
"Hmph! You old bastard!"
At this moment, A Hao stepped forward. If he were alone, he might have been afraid of the old village head and worried about his words.
But A Hao had a patron today, and he knew they were carrying weapons. How could he fear the villagers of Xiao Yu Cun?
If they got angry, they would shoot them all!
"We came here to find Wang Li! Let him come out!"
A Hao was truly bullying with the tiger's might. Others hadn't spoken yet, but his posture was fully in control and he threatened the old village head back.
His tone suggested he wasn't at all afraid of Su Nantian.
"Quickly! I'll tear down your village!"
After saying this, A Hao kicked a stone nearby, splashing mud everywhere to scare the old village head.
"You!"
The old village head hadn't expected A Hao to be so arrogant this time. Last time he came, he looked like a mouse seeing a cat, but now he was bold.
It seemed he wasn't afraid of Su Nantian at all.
"You're really stubborn."
The old village head shook his head and sighed, giving his evaluation.
He had hoped A Hao would turn over a new leaf or at least heed Su Nantian's warning and not dare to be so reckless.
But he hadn't expected that people like him would only change when they saw the coffin.
"Quickly! Let Wang Li come out!"
A Hao furrowed his brows again, annoyed by the old village head's evaluation. Then he frowned impatiently: "Do you know who they are? Long Ge and the others aren't here to talk about it."
After saying this, he raised three fingers: "I'll give you three seconds. Either let him come out or you all will die with him!"
"Spit!"
The villagers were outraged and glared at A Hao, not expecting him to be so shameless.
"Wang Li wouldn't fear you, this scum!"
The villagers continued to curse A Hao. One person bent down and picked up a stone to throw at them, others followed suit, also throwing stones toward A Hao.
"Hey! Hey?"
A Hao was startled and hit by a stone, then quickly jumped back to dodge the stones: "You've gone too far! You're really rebelling!"
"Stop it!"
At this moment, Long Ge also got angry and warned: "Don't listen to them! We continue throwing stones; we have more people, they are just a few, and we can definitely drive them away!"
The old village head shouted this with full energy. He bent down and picked up a stone.
This was their village, where they had lived for generations. It was time to protect it with their own strength!
"Yes, Village Head!"
Other villagers nodded and replied immediately, also imitating the old village head and picking up stones to throw at them.
"Stop it!"
Long Ge cursed again, his brow twitching as if he could no longer bear it.
"Bang!"
At this moment, a gunshot rang out, startling countless birds in the forest.
"Ah!"
"Ah! They shot! They shot!"
The villagers of Xiao Yu Cun were completely terrified. They hadn't expected them to carry guns! What a dangerous weapon it was!
The old village head also had a pale face, barely supporting himself with his cane.
"Be quiet!"
Long Ge saw them all calm down and looked like they were in a panic. He frowned and warned: "Everyone, crouch down! If you don't want to be shot, stay quiet!"
Long Ge warned again. Originally the villagers didn't want to listen to him, but they had no choice—Long Ge had a gun in his hand!
That thing wasn't a joke.
Everyone, for their own lives, did as instructed and all crouched on the ground.
"Cover your heads."
Long Ge warned again, not wanting to make things worse. They had only come to check the situation.
But who could have known these villagers were so ignorant and arrogant, thinking they were a dish?
Long Ge had no choice but to use force to suppress them and make them speak carefully.
"Now can you tell me where Su Nantian is?"
Long Ge frowned and ordered, "Oh, now you call him Wang Li?"
"He is Wang Li!"
One villager replied unwillingly: "He's the nephew of Uncle Wang, came to visit relatives, and has been working as a doctor here. He's not called Su Nantian at all!"
"Yes! Yes, you must have mistaken him!"
Other villagers also echoed.
In an instant, they started to argue again.
"Be quiet!"
At this moment, A Chuan had reached his limit and stepped forward with a murderous look, shouting: "All of you shut up! If anyone speaks again, I'll shoot them!"
After A Chuan said this, others quickly fell silent and didn't dare to speak anymore.
"I don't care if he's called Su Nantian or Wang Li, but we have something to find him. Go and get him for me."
Chapter 817: Invading the Temple
Whether it's this person or not, you just need to meet him and confirm.
It's no use guessing now.
"Did you hear that?"
Long Ge also added, his face full of impatience. He thought these villagers were just being stubborn and would only comply after being forced to do so.
"I'll give you one last chance! If you don't hand him over quickly, I'll kill all of you and flatten your Xiao Yu Cun!"
Long Ge frowned again, annoyed, scanning these people with a look of disdain. He thought they were just adding trouble for him.
"Exactly! Didn't you hear Long Ge's words?"
At this moment, A Hao also stepped forward as a sycophant. He first smiled at Long Ge and then, when looking at the villagers, completely changed his expression, more exaggerated than a chameleon.
"Be wise and cooperate! Otherwise your lives won't be safe!"
After saying this, A Hao threatened by making a neck-cutting gesture to scare these villagers.
"What should we do now?"
The villagers were very anxious.
But they saw that A Hao and Long Ge had come with hostile intentions, clearly not looking for Su Nantian to do anything good.
So even though they were threatened, the villagers still refused to reveal anything.
They were also worried that if they did, A Hao would trouble Su Nantian.
But these people weren't good at all; they were eager to find Su Nantian and had finally arrived here. Seeing the villagers remained silent, they felt impatient and couldn't bear it anymore.
Especially seeing that after so long, the villagers hadn't given them a response, Long Ge and others felt even more angry.
They thought maybe these villagers had decided they wouldn't dare to act, so they were rebelling against them?
After thinking this through, they became even more arrogant and looked at the villagers with fiercer eyes.
"Listen, I'm not joking. Be wise and get him out quickly; otherwise when I get angry, you'll know what kind of fate awaits you!"
At this point, Long Ge took out his gun and idly played with it in his hand to scare these innocent villagers.
The villagers saw that Long Ge had a gun and took a deep breath, confirming he wasn't an ordinary person.
Everyone was even more frightened and shivered, but these people still didn't dare to reveal Su Nantian's location.
Especially thinking about how Su Nantian had helped them in Xiao Yu Cun so much, treating illnesses and introducing new herbs that improved their lives.
The villagers felt even more determined not to reveal Su Nantian's location or push him into the fire.
At this moment, Xiao Chen was also very angry and rushed forward.
"What are you looking for him for? And you! A Hao! Have you not been punished enough by Long Ge yet? Or have you forgotten that Long Ge said if you dared to step into Xiao Yu Cun again, he would kill you!"
Xiao Chen saw A Hao coming with such a strong presence and people who clearly weren't good, disrupting their peaceful life. He was furious and thought A Hao would never learn his lesson.
He wished he had advised Su Nantian to deal with A Hao quickly, so as not to leave this big trouble.
A Hao had already felt embarrassed and lost face in the afternoon, feeling angry. Now seeing Xiao Chen bringing up this embarrassment in front of so many people made A Hao feel ashamed.
But more than that, he felt angry. Especially when Xiao Chen brought up Su Nantian, it reminded him of Su Nantian's power.
The threat from Su Nantian was clearly echoing in A Hao's mind.
Thinking of this, A Hao shivered slightly; it was almost his instinctive reaction when facing Su Nantian.
But soon, A Hao adjusted his emotions. He was also very scared, but he thought this time he wasn't alone; there were others supporting him behind.
Like Long Ge and the others, and A Hao had seen their weapons. They weren't ordinary things; they were guns!
Ordinary people didn't have them. He didn't believe Su Nantian could be so powerful as to not fear these things.
After thinking this through, A Hao made up his mind and looked at Xiao Chen with a glint of murder.
Su Nantian was A Hao's top target, but Xiao Chen was also someone he deeply disliked.
While dealing with Su Nantian, A Hao also wanted to get rid of this troublemaker, Xiao Chen, so he wouldn't be a nuisance anymore and affect his mood.
"Brother, what are you doing!"
Chen Xiaoling hadn't expected Xiao Chen to be so impulsive, daring to resist even when they had such power.
After thinking about this, Chen Xiaoling's heart went cold halfway.
She quickly pulled Xiao Chen's hand and signaled her brother not to say such words anymore.
