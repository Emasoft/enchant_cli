"Speaking of which, Nan Gong Lin paused slightly before continuing: 'Do you think I truly trust him? It's only because he still has some utility that I've entrusted him. So you don't need to worry—I won't be deceived by him.'"

After a brief pause, Nan Gong Lin indeed addressed Jin Guanjia, his words and demeanor radiating complete arrogance. It seemed as though everything was under his control, and he was utterly confident in his superiority, convinced that he would never suffer losses at the hands of a young man.

"Master is wise! This time I was indeed negligent," Jin Guanjia replied.

Since Nan Gong Lin had already made up his mind and would never believe Jin Guanjia's words, Jin Guanjia realized that continuing to speak would only be unappreciated and could offend Nan Gong Lin. Thus, he ceased speaking and instead obediently praised Nan Gong Lin.

Afterward, Nan Gong Lin and Jin Guanjia discussed for a while before Nan Gong Lin waved his hand, dismissing Jin Guanjia.

Meanwhile, Su Nantian was not entirely idle. He knew he had spent too much time among the three in the Nan Gong family.

Su Nantian was aware that his time was extremely urgent and could not be wasted. Therefore, he quickly finished the necessary tasks at the Nan Gong family and took the opportunity to handle his own affairs. As Su Nantian was about to leave again to gather more information from Li Zhe, Nan Gong Fei suddenly appeared.

Nan Gong Fei feigned a chance encounter, looking surprised and approached Su Nantian with an initiative greeting: "Hey! Isn't this Su Nantian, the capable subordinate of your elder brother?"

After saying that, Nan Gong Fei paused again before continuing with a surprised tone: "I didn't expect to meet you here! How coincidental!"

After saying that, Nan Gong Fei热情ly waved at Su Nantian with genuine enthusiasm.

Upon hearing Nan Gong Fei's words, Su Nantian inwardly rolled his eyes and silently criticized him.

This was the Nan Gong family's territory. Meeting him here, what was there to be surprised about? What was so unusual?

Moreover, Nan Gong Fei clearly had been waiting for him here. He deliberately pretended to be surprised and said this coincidence, but if Su Nantian hadn't restrained himself, he would have laughed out loud at this moment.

Su Nantian immediately felt that Nan Gong Fei's performance was becoming increasingly fake, and it made him want to mock more. He wondered if Nan Gong Fei even knew how terrible his acting was!

But despite thinking this, Su Nantian could only comply with Nan Gong Fei's performance.

Su Nantian then displayed a suitable smile and politely greeted Nan Gong Fei: "Ah, Master, it's such a coincidence. Are you looking for the elder master?"

Since the other party enjoyed acting, Su Nantian didn't mind playing along and seeing what Nan Gong Fei was up to. He secretly wanted to uncover the other's intentions.

"Actually, I'm not looking for them. I specifically came to see you."

At this moment, Nan Gong Fei smiled and suddenly spoke.

Upon hearing Nan Gong Fei's tone, Su Nantian felt a sudden jolt in his heart. He couldn't understand why an obvious sense of unease arose.

At the same time, Su Nantian was silently speculating. Perhaps Nan Gong Fei had grown tired of constantly acting and was finally revealing his true colors?

"Master, specifically coming to see me? I didn't understand. You said it was a coincidence before," Su Nantian thought for a moment, but still couldn't get a clear answer. Therefore, he decided to take a conservative approach and feign ignorance, waiting for the other's next move before carefully planning his next step.

"Ah, whether it's specifically or coincidentally, we met here anyway."

Nan Gong Fei suddenly let out a light laugh. A shrewdness quickly flashed in his eyes before he continued: "You've taken good care of me all along, and you've spoken well of me to the elder master. I haven't had a chance to properly thank you yet. Since we met so coincidentally today, why not go out for a meal together?"

As he spoke, Nan Gong Fei continued: "I just happen to know a Hunan restaurant that serves excellent cuisine. I heard you like spicy food, so let's go together."

Chapter 691: Hongmen Banquet

"Master, you're too kind! I'm just a servant. Everything is my duty. There's no need for gratitude, Master. Besides, your time is precious; how could I dare to waste it?"

Su Nantian's heart slightly sank. He couldn't figure out Nan Gong Fei's intentions at all, so he directly refused and added: "Master doesn't need to thank me. It's what I should do."

Why would he invite me for a meal so suddenly? It must be like a weasel paying homage to a chicken, with ill intentions!

Su Nantian thought this way, and his refusal became even more resolute.

"Is it because I'm just the master's cousin, and you don't care about me? So you look down on me and my invitation?"

At this moment, Nan Gong Fei's expression suddenly darkened. His words took a sharp turn, and his whole demeanor became harsh, completely unlike the previous amicable manner.

"Master, what are you talking about? How could I think that way? You've truly misunderstood me."

Su Nantian quickly explained, then sighed helplessly in his heart.

It seemed that Nan Gong Fei had already made up his mind. No matter if it was intimidation or temptation, he wouldn't let him escape today.

Moreover, this clearly seemed like a Hongmen Banquet. Nan Gong Fei's attitude was quite clear—he would not refuse, but he must attend.

After thinking about this, Su Nantian changed his tone and agreed.

"Since the Master has extended such a generous invitation, if I refuse again, it would be ungrateful. So I can only shamelessly accept this meal."

After all, dragging on would result in the same outcome. It was better to save some time and just agree.

No matter what Nan Gong Fei's main purpose was, he would have to go to the place he had set before speaking. Since that was the case, Su Nantian didn't mind going alone to this banquet.

"Ah, that's right. Since you're the elder master's capable subordinate, you are essentially one of us! Why be so polite with each other?"

Upon hearing Su Nantian's acceptance of his invitation, Nan Gong Fei's expression immediately changed. He was no longer harsh as before but instead regained his original amiable demeanor, smiling and looking at Su Nantian with a warm gaze as if the previous harsh face was just Su Nantian's imagination.

"Come on, hurry in. Hurry and see what you want to eat."

After Nan Gong Fei and Su Nantian arrived at the Hunan restaurant he mentioned, Nan Gong Fei immediately热情ly welcomed Su Nantian.

"Don't be polite. Just order what you want."

Nan Gong Fei immediately pushed the menu toward Su Nantian, letting him choose.

Since they had come this far, Su Nantian wouldn't let himself starve. He smiled and nodded, took the menu Nan Gong Fei handed him, and casually flipped through it. He didn't hesitate to order a signature dish and a soup.

"Master, you should also choose some dishes. I've already selected them."

Su Nantian returned the menu and politely said.

Seeing that he had indeed ordered dishes without hesitation, Nan Gong Fei's smile became even more evident, expanding by at least a circle.

Soon after, the dishes they ordered arrived. Throughout the meal, Nan Gong Fei热情ly took care of Su Nantian, as if afraid he wouldn't eat enough. He kept serving dishes and recommending them, almost taking over the waiters' duties in the private room.

"Go down."

Upon realizing that Nan Gong Fei had gone to such lengths to call him out, Su Nantian naturally knew it wasn't just a simple invitation for a meal. Indeed, after three rounds of wine and having eaten about seven or eight parts full, Nan Gong Fei finally took action.

He waved his hand and softly instructed the two waiters in the private room to leave first.

After they left, Nan Gong Fei looked at Su Nantian seriously: "Did you find the food to your taste?"

"Of course, it's delicious. Thank you for generously inviting me," Su Nantian politely and respectfully replied, then looked directly into Nan Gong Fei's eyes, waiting for his next words.

Nan Gong Fei didn't delay further but hooked his lips and continued: "The food is to your taste. Then, how about me? Can I enter your eyes?"

After saying that, Nan Gong Fei stared at Su Nantian with a burning gaze. The implication was very strong; he was clearly trying to recruit Su Nantian!

Upon hearing this sentence, Su Nantian was momentarily stunned.

Then he silently sighed, thinking that he must be quite sought after, as so many people were vying to have him act as an informant. However, sometimes it's better to be few but high quality, so Su Nantian was now being invited one after another to act as an informant. He didn't know whether he should be happy about his popularity or troubled by it.

It seemed this was indeed a clear Hongmen Banquet.

Su Nantian silently sighed, but his expression remained unchanged. Instead of revealing his true thoughts, he feigned a look of fear and even accidentally knocked over the tea on the table.

Su Nantian looked at Nan Gong Fei in surprise, as if completely stunned by him. Then he asked in astonishment: "Master, did you say something wrong? I don't understand what you're saying at all."

Su Nantian decided to use his first trick of feigning ignorance, watching Nan Gong Fei's next move.

After seeing Su Nantian feign ignorance, Nan Gong Fei's lips slightly curled up, revealing a more profound smile. Then he looked at Su Nantian and said: "Nantian, I know you're a smart person."

At this point, Nan Gong Fei continued speaking and this time used an encouraging tone, as if guiding Su Nantian: "Since I called you over today, it's because I want to be open and honest. We can talk openly; there's no need for you to continue concealing yourself in front of me."

Nan Gong Fei paused briefly before continuing: "You, who are so smart, really want to stay with my mediocre elder master? Even if you're willing to follow him, I wouldn't want to waste such a talent. This principle doesn't need me to explain it again, you should understand it clearly, right?"

After saying this, Nan Gong Fei smiled meaningfully again and kept watching Su Nantian secretly.

His gaze wasn't trying to hide, but was very direct, clearly telling Su Nantian that he was watching him directly.

After a while, Nan Gong Fei didn't wait for Su Nantian's response and continued speaking. This time, his tone was still encouraging, trying to persuade Su Nantian to work for him.

Chapter 692: Feigned Surrender

"Nantian, good birds choose their trees to perch on; loyal ministers choose their masters. You would rather stay with my mediocre elder master and never have a chance to rise, or come help me instead?"

As Nan Gong Fei spoke, he slowly got up and approached Su Nantian. He was trying to get close to Su Nantian, using this intimidation to force him to comply.

"Only if you are loyal to me will I not disappoint you. Trust me, my talent far surpasses the elder master's, and my achievements will definitely be much better than his."

Nan Gong Fei seemed to have already decided that Su Nantian would choose him, so he now completely exposed his ambitions before Su Nantian without any disguise. At the same time, his face was filled with confidence, as if everything was under his control.

Since Nan Gong Fei had already spoken so clearly and directly, Su Nantian couldn't continue to feign ignorance anymore.

So he changed his expression and looked at Nan Gong Fei seriously.

Su Nantian first placed his hand on the table, extended his fingers slightly, and then lightly tapped the edge of the table. The tapping was very rhythmic, with a clear sound.

Then he looked at Nan Gong Fei and said seriously: "Since the Master has extended such a generous invitation, why don't you tell me what benefits you can offer if I really follow you?"

Upon hearing Su Nantian's words, Nan Gong Fei's eyes slightly deepened.

It seemed he had finally caught Su Nantian's mistake, and he felt he had made the right choice. He paused for a moment before speaking slowly: "Don't worry, since I've invited you, I won't disappoint you."

Nan Gong Fei slowly continued speaking and looked at Su Nantian deeply before continuing: "You can rest assured that I won't disappoint you, just like the elder master did. On the contrary, you can propose your own conditions. As long as it's within my ability to fulfill, I will agree."

After saying this sentence, Nan Gong Fei looked at Su Nantian with an unwavering gaze. It was as if he had no doubt that Su Nantian would choose to accept.

This offer was extremely tempting!

If Su Nantian were truly a member of the Nan Gong family, he would have been bought by Nan Gong Fei already.

Unfortunately, he had other things to do in the Nan Gong family this time and would not waste his time on such trivial matters. Not only could he offer one condition, but even if he offered countless conditions, Su Nantian would not be tempted.

However, Su Nantian felt that this experience was particularly interesting. After all, being sought after by so many people was a rare experience. He didn't know if he would ever have such an interesting opportunity again.

Therefore, Su Nantian was very willing to enjoy this time of being competed for.

"Alright, you don't need to look so troubled."

At this moment, Nan Gong Fei spoke patiently. He carefully observed Su Nantian's expression and clearly misunderstood it as hesitation and indecision.

"You don't need to answer me immediately. You can go back and think it over, then tell me your decision."

Nan Gong Fei spoke again in a humane manner. He seemed not to be in a hurry at all, as if he had plenty of patience waiting for Su Nantian's response.

But more importantly, it was because Nan Gong Fei believed that no one would give up such a good opportunity.

"Can I go back and think about it?"

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian softly asked again. His eyes quickly flashed with a hint of amusement, finding Nan Gong Fei particularly interesting.

"Of course. This is like Jiang Taigong fishing, and those who want to bite will come."

Nan Gong Fei nodded seriously and answered Su Nantian. Then his expression suddenly became serious, and his gaze at Su Nantian had a hint of warning.

"The premise is that after you go back, you can't talk about this to anyone in the Nan Gong family. I assure you, if you leak our conversation to others, you will definitely not have a good outcome."

Using both kindness and severity is the usual method of those in power. And Nan Gong Fei took a polite approach first.

Therefore, when Su Nantian heard this threat and warning, he felt no worry or fear. He just played along with a worried expression, his tone also had a touch of appropriate trembling.

"Master, rest assured. Everything I said today will stay in my stomach and won't be leaked at all."

Su Nantian also replied with a promise.

"Good."

Upon hearing Su Nantian's cooperation, Nan Gong Fei looked even more satisfied. He also took a look at Su Nantian with an appreciative gaze, feeling that his choice was correct and he had chosen the right person.

"By the way, Nantian, don't think I'm carefree. My reputation isn't good, and few people fear me. But I do have my own methods. You can refuse this cooperation, but if you agree, you must be completely loyal. Otherwise, I never show mercy to those who betray me."

Nan Gong Fei suddenly lowered his voice and threatened Su Nantian. His eyes also carried a clear warning, as if warning Su Nantian.

"Yes, Master!"

Su Nantian also played along with a frightened and anxious expression, as if truly intimidated by Nan Gong Fei. He quickly nodded in compliance and answered respectfully.

Seeing Su Nantian's cooperation, Nan Gong Fei's smile became even broader. His gaze at Su Nantian also had a touch of tenderness: "Alright, since you're still the elder master's man, you must have a lot of things to do. I won't waste your time. You can go back."

"Yes, Master!"

Su Nantian had no objections and answered respectfully. He was about to leave.

"Nantian."

As Su Nantian reached the door of the private room, Nan Gong Fei suddenly called him back. His tone was serious and had an air of refusal.

"Master, what else do you need?"

Su Nantian complied and turned around, asking curiously.

"Nothing. Just let you go back and think carefully."

Nan Gong Fei hooked his lips again and said: "Oh, by the way, I hope you give me a good answer."

Chapter 693: Gathering Information

"Yes, Master."

Su Nantian nodded again and answered seriously. As for whether he would truly think it over after returning, or even if he thought about it at all, that was another matter.

After leaving the private room, Su Nantian's fear and anxiety immediately disappeared. He quickly returned to his usual demeanor and state, completely unlike the timid and fearful person he had been when facing Nan Gong Fei.

At the same time, Nan Gong Fei in the private room also suppressed his smile. His eyes reflected a deep calculation and clearly had ulterior motives. It was obvious he wasn't really intending to keep his promise to Su Nantian.

However, Su Nantian didn't truly believe Nan Gong Fei either. He quickly put this unexpected small incident aside and followed his planned steps to continue gathering more information.

Su Nantian's first step was to find Li Zhe. He thought that since Li Zhe had a connection with the Wu family, he might be able to find more information about Wu You'er from Li Zhe.

Because Su Nantian was completely in the dark about where Wu You'er was, he could only indirectly probe Li Zhe for any discovery, which would be a significant breakthrough.

That was Su Nantian's real purpose.

He quickly arrived at the inland port, which was Li Zhe's usual workplace. When Su Nantian arrived, Li Zhe was just overseeing the workers moving goods. He was bustling around directing them, and he looked quite capable.

Quickly, Li Zhe noticed Su Nantian approaching while focused on directing the workers. He immediately widened his eyes, showing a bit of surprise and then quickly ran over to greet Su Nantian with a smile: "Hey! Brother Tian! You came to see me! Is there something important you need me to do?"

After saying the first half, Li Zhe immediately added the second part. His tone was very enthusiastic and sincere, treating Su Nantian as his elder brother: "If there's anything you need, just call me and I'll take care of it right away. Why did you come in person? It's so tiring!"

"Alright, don't be so enthusiastic. I just have a small matter to ask you about," Su Nantian interrupted Li Zhe's speech and spoke softly. He asked Li Zhe while looking at his face with a serious gaze, trying to see if there was anything unusual.

"By the way! What have you been busy with recently?"

Even though Su Nantian wanted to gather information from Li Zhe, he needed to make small talk first to avoid being too abrupt. Otherwise, it would definitely raise Li Zhe's suspicions.

"Hmm! What could I be busy with? Just running around the port, watching the cargo and recording it! These days I've been so salty from the sea breeze!"

Li Zhe, upon hearing Su Nantian's question, immediately became fully attentive and looked at Su Nantian seriously. He first answered Su Nantian's question, then immediately asked: "Brother Tian, what do you want me to find out? If I know it, I'll tell you everything without holding back. I promise to complete the task! Just rest assured and tell me!"

Li Zhe, while patting his chest and loudly promising, also secretly glanced at Su Nantian with a subtle gaze to try to catch any clues.

However, the gap between Su Nantian and Li Zhe was not just a little. Even if Li Zhe stared endlessly, he could never penetrate Su Nantian's true thoughts.

"Alright, don't talk so much! I don't need you to promise so much!"

Su Nantian saw Li Zhe speaking like a continuous firecracker, not even starting the task yet, and already saying one promise after another. He felt a bit amused but also helpless.

Su Nantian first interrupted Li Zhe's speech, then slowly said: "I just want to ask you something. If you know, tell me; if not, don't say so much."

Su Nantian was already regretting his decision. He felt that coming to Li Zhe for information was completely the wrong choice.

"Got it! Brother Tian, just tell me. I promise to tell you everything I know!"

Li Zhe again patted his chest and loudly promised. He looked at Su Nantian seriously, as if he wanted to dig out his heart and show his loyalty.

"Let me ask you."

Su Nantian looked at Li Zhe again, then spoke: "I just want to ask you, what's your relationship with Wu Family's Li Assistant? Why did you deliver the message both times?"

This was something Su Nantian wanted to know, but it wasn't something he had to know. However, to avoid Li Zhe's suspicion, Su Nantian could only use this as an excuse.

"Ah! So Brother Tian came here in the morning just to ask about that!"

Li Zhe seemed confused by Su Nantian's question. After a brief pause, he spoke: "What's our relationship? Isn't it obvious! Brother Tian! My name is Li Zhe, and the Li Assistant's name is Li Mu."

"Li Zhe? Li Mu?"

They both have the surname Li?

Su Nantian already had a vague guess in his heart, and he seemed to understand something.

Indeed, Li Zhe continued: "Yes! Brother Tian! The Li Assistant is my uncle! My own uncle!"

At this point, Li Zhe seemed very excited and told Su Nantian loudly: "Brother Tian! He's my own uncle! Otherwise, would I risk my life to do his bidding?"

After saying this, Li Zhe immediately lowered his voice and cautiously looked around before continuing: "Brother Tian, you know that the Nan Gong family's people are so powerful. If they found out I betrayed them, I'm afraid I'd be skinned alive!"

Li Zhe's implication was that if the Li Assistant wasn't his uncle, he wouldn't have betrayed them.

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian's heart had already formed a vague guess. His expression was covered with a thin veil of mist.

"Does that make sense, Brother Tian?"

Li Zhe said while raising his hand to scratch the back of his head and looked at Su Nantian with a smile.

After a brief pause, Li Zhe continued: "I don't know why Brother Tian suddenly asked this question. Did you find something? Or is it related to me?"

Chapter 694: Almost Exposed

"Brother Tian, just tell me! You know I'm pretty dumb and can't figure it out. Don't make me guess like this!"

Li Zhe asked several questions and then immediately looked at Su Nantian with eagerness, wanting an answer.

"There's nothing special. I was just thinking that since it was always you who delivered the message, I was a bit concerned about your relationship. But now that I know you're Li Mu's nephew, it means you won't betray the Wu family."

Su Nantian smiled and answered: "Now I'm relieved."

After Su Nantian learned about his relationship with Li Mu from Li Zhe, he knew this investigation was definitely a dead end. So Su Nantian gave up on it and didn't continue, to avoid Li Zhe verifying with Li Mu and causing more trouble for himself.

Thinking about this, Su Nantian's expression became slightly serious again.

If this continued, he wouldn't know when he could find clues about Wu Tao and his wife. Not to mention the near future, even Wu You'er's situation was unknown.

Green Fence had only briefly mentioned the situation before, and no more information had been gathered. It was worrying.

Thinking about this, Su Nantian's mood became even heavier, especially worried about Wu You'er's situation becoming more severe.

If that were the case, would Wu You'er be able to hold out until he came to rescue? If... that would be a disaster!

Meanwhile, Li Zhe also regained his composure. He first widened his eyes and looked at Su Nantian in surprise.

Then he angrily spoke: "Brother Tian! Are you really like that? Do you think I would scheme against you?"

Li Zhe shouted at Su Nantian while also angrily puffing out his cheeks: "If I didn't know I was Li Mu's nephew, would you really suspect me? You're too untrustworthy!"

Li Zhe was getting more and more upset, and he looked at Su Nantian with a reproachful gaze as if accusing him of not considering him a comrade.

"Brother Tian, don't forget! I was the one who personally promoted you. How could I betray you? You're too unkind!"

Li Zhe was getting more and more upset, feeling that Su Nantian didn't consider him a comrade. He was almost ready to accuse Su Nantian.

Su Nantian had just used an excuse and was only trying to get by, so when he saw Li Zhe's big reaction, he didn't say anything. Instead, he feigned an embarrassed smile.

Then Su Nantian said: "It's just that this matter is significant, so we need to be cautious. Now that it's confirmed we're on the same side, we can talk openly and don't need to hide anymore."

Su Nantian said this while raising his eyebrows to imply Li Zhe: "Don't you think that's the case?"

"Yes, it is. But I still feel like I've been wronged. It's like there's a log blocking my heart, and I feel uncomfortable all over!"

Li Zhe was still upset. He grumbled and complained, looking at Su Nantian with reproach: "I feel so wronged! I almost got accused by Brother Tian!"

"Alright, don't argue with me anymore. Don't feel bad. Later I'll invite you to eat, as a way to apologize for my mistake. That should be okay, right?"

Upon hearing this, Li Zhe immediately showed a happy expression and nodded happily: "Ah! Brother Tian, that's the right way to do it!"

After a pause, Li Zhe laughed out loud: "Brother Tian, our brotherly friendship shouldn't be misunderstood because of this one suspicion. You must definitely stay and have a few more drinks with me!"

"Alright, don't mention two cups. Even three aren't a problem."

Su Nantian saw that Li Zhe was finally calmed down, so he sighed in relief and said: "Now you feel better? No longer uncomfortable?"

"Ah! I do!"

Li Zhe smiled again, looking at Su Nantian with embarrassment.

"By the way, don't get distracted. This is just the first thing. My main purpose today was to ask you about another matter."

After a brief pause, Su Nantian suddenly spoke.

"Alright, Brother Tian, just say it. We can talk openly about anything!"

Li Zhe immediately responded and patted his chest, loudly promising.

"It's simple. I just want to ask you about what Li Mu likes. He seems not to like me, or he has some issues with me. Every time I see him, his eyes aren't eyes and his nose isn't a nose, which is really uncomfortable."

Su Nantian knew that if he didn't say something concrete, Li Zhe would still be suspicious. So he took the opportunity to play along and appear to want to please Li Mu.

After all, this sentence wasn't entirely false. Li Mu did indeed dislike him and always targeted him deliberately.

"Since you two are uncle and nephew, you must know his preferences."

After a pause, Su Nantian added: "That's right. I'm sure you know his preferences."

Indeed, upon hearing this, Li Zhe's suspicion faded significantly. Then he patted his chest and promised: "Ah! That's the thing!"

Li Zhe laughed out loud and spoke to Su Nantian: "You can rest assured, Brother Tian. I truly consider you my elder brother. My uncle is your uncle. I'll take care of this problem for you!"

"Then thank you."

Upon seeing Li Zhe agree, Su Nantian's lips slightly curved up. His eyes also had a slight smile.

"Come on, let's eat. I need to apologize for my mistake."

After saying this, Su Nantian directly reached out and hooked Li Zhe's shoulder, inviting him to eat.

"Got it!"

Li Zhe also laughed generously and responded loudly: "Brother Tian, we're brothers! Once the misunderstanding is cleared, don't mention it again!"

After saying this, Li Zhe remembered what Su Nantian had said and added: "Brother Tian, you don't need to overthink it. My uncle is naturally conservative and very loyal to Wu Master, so he's cautious. If he gets to know you better later, he'll definitely change his mind!"

Li Zhe said this and then winked at Su Nantian, smiling: "Besides, Brother Tian, there's me. I'll definitely speak well of you to my uncle and help him change his opinion quickly!"

"Alright, I'll thank you for that first."

Su Nantian complied with Li Zhe's words. They exchanged a few sentences, and both talked warmly while leaving to eat, as if there were no more suspicions between them. They had completely opened up and no longer doubted each other.

Chapter 695: Mutual Torture

"Brother Tian, come on! I'll drink to you. Thank you for promoting and taking care of me!"

After arriving at the restaurant, Li Zhe immediately热情ly started to toast. He didn't take seriously what he had said about punishing Su Nantian earlier.

After saying that, Li Zhe热情ly poured wine for Su Nantian. He looked especially enthusiastic.

"Good, I'll also toast you. Let's drink this cup and clear up the misunderstanding."

Su Nantian cooperated with Li Zhe to toast. In reality, his mind was quickly calculating other matters. His thoughts were entirely not on Li Zhe.

Unfortunately, Su Nantian didn't know that while he was trying to gather information from Li Zhe, Wu You'er's situation had again encountered a problem. It seemed her anorexia was getting worse.

"What about this waste now?"

In the Wu family's meeting hall, Wu Chuan sat on a high seat with an expressionless face. His eyes were cold like ice, and they seemed to be poisoned arrows that would make people shiver upon contact. Even death could result from it.

Wu Chuan's lips slightly moved, and his words were as cold and unfeeling as his expression. When he said the next sentence, his eyes clearly flashed with a brief hatred.

And it was unmistakable hatred.

Clearly, Wu Chuan's "waste" referred to his unendurable Wu You'er.

"Master, the situation of Miss Wu You'er seems even worse. According to her personal doctor, she now has a strong rejection reaction to the nutritional injections, and the reaction is very significant."

Li Mu respectfully stood before Wu Chuan. Upon hearing Wu Chuan's question, he truthfully informed him of Wu You'er's situation. However, when mentioning Wu You'er's condition, Li Mu's eyes quickly flashed with a complex emotion.

"Moreover, the doctor said that if Wu You'er's rejection reaction continues to be this strong, nutritional injections can't continue."

When Li Mu said this, he paused for a moment. It seemed he remembered the sight of Wu You'er's emaciated state when he visited her.

However, Li Mu didn't have much compassion for Wu You'er. After a brief pause, he quickly regained his professional demeanor and continued to report Wu You'er's situation to Wu Chuan.

"Waste! This is truly a waste that doesn't let me rest!"

Upon hearing Li Mu's report, Wu Chuan's face immediately darkened. He angrily threw the cup beside him and his expression was filled with anger and dissatisfaction.

He clearly felt angry at Wu You'er's silent resistance.

"If it weren't for this waste still having some use, she wouldn't see the sun tomorrow!"
