“Zhang, the two million yuan you gave me—back then I was blinded by greed and tampered with the data of Ke Mao and Chuang Rong, removing some highlights from Chuan Rong’s files before recommending Ke Mao to you.” Qi Yinzhen said, his gaze carrying a hint of embarrassment as he looked at Zhang Feng.

Zhang Feng’s heart sank as he heard this. With evidence and testimony in hand, what could he say? His denials were futile; he was already doomed. Moreover, this matter involved bribery and falsified accounts—each detail could secure a conviction.

Zhang Feng rushed to the table, his voice trembling as he addressed Su Nantian: “Chairman, I’ll surrender all the money I’ve obtained. I’m willing to step down from finance and hand over every power, just like Li Hounian did. Please grant me a path to survival and don’t turn me over to the investigators.”

Zhang Feng was no fool. He knew Li Hounian had escaped punishment by relinquishing all his authority. This time, he needed to do the same—better to surrender than wait for Su Nantian’s judgment. Perhaps this could secure a lighter sentence.

Su Nantian let out a cold laugh at Zhang Feng’s words. Clearly, he understood the stakes. Likely, it was Li Houchao’s case that had prompted this confession.

“Is your crime the same as Li Houchao’s? He leaked tender documents, which could be considered commercial espionage. The company covered it up. But you—bribery and falsified accounts? Can I simply let you off?” Su Nantian’s tone carried a threat.

“Then what do you want? If you don’t hand me over to the investigators, I’ll agree to anything!” Zhang Feng’s heart pounded as he replied.

Chapter 443: Conditions

Zhang Feng had never imagined this moment. He’d hoped to slip away unnoticed, siphoning the money and vanishing at the right time. But now, the truth was undeniable: he was no different from Li Hounian—perhaps even worse. At least Li Hounian had surrendered his power and secured freedom. Zhang Feng, however, found himself powerless.

He could only stare at Su Nantian, awaiting the resolution. Meanwhile, Qi Yinzhen felt a strange satisfaction. He had witnessed Zhang Feng’s downfall from the start, yet all was under Su Nantian’s control. Watching this game unfold as planned gave him a sense of fulfillment.

“Do you think I don’t know your plan? You took Ke Mao’s money, then falsified accounts to skim profits. When the project funds vanished, how could the company survive? This massive venture lost half its life. Do you think I’d let you live?” Su Nantian continued, and Zhang Feng’s body trembled.

Zhang Feng had planned to drain the company’s finances before leaving. But now, his scheme was exposed.

“I’ll surrender all my assets—every penny I’ve received from Ke Mao, every company fund untouched. I’ll return them all and give my personal wealth to the company. Just don’t hand me over to the investigators,” Zhang Feng pleaded, his voice desperate.

Su Nantian rubbed his chin, then said: “Either you transfer everything to me or go to prison. Don’t play games; I’m watching.”

Su Nantian returned to his seat, waiting for Zhang Feng’s choice. Zhang Feng understood: surrender everything or face prison.

Though reluctant, he knew the alternative was decades in jail. He approached Su Nantian: “I accept. I’ll transfer all my assets to you. But you must promise not to hand me over.”

Su Nantian hadn’t expected Zhang Feng’s compliance. Yet, driven by desperation, he had chosen this path.

“I promise,” Su Nantian replied. “But you must also hand over all financial records. I’ll assign professionals to monitor your every move. Any trickery and our deal is void.” He nodded to Qi Yinzhen, and they left Zhang Feng’s office.

Zhang Feng watched their retreating figures, gritting his teeth. He hadn’t expected karma to strike so swiftly. He’d hoped to vanish after this deal, leaving everything behind. But now, he was trapped.

He realized too late that Qi Yinzhen had betrayed him. The man who’d once been a threat now doomed him. Yet Zhang Feng would never know the truth: Su Nantian had orchestrated everything from Li Hounian’s downfall.

Chapter 444: Dispelling Rumors

Su Nantian hadn’t expected Zhang Feng to transfer his assets so quickly. Within two days, all his wealth was under Su Nantian’s name.

Su Nantian swiftly took control of the finance department. Unlike the business division, this transition was smooth—just sorting accounts, no need for personal connections.

The entire Tihao Group was in chaos. While people understood Li Hounian’s case, they didn’t know Zhang Feng’s departure. Rumors spread: Su Nantian planned to purge the old guard.

This was expected. Su Nantian called a meeting, addressing the executives: “I know rumors about my plans to overhaul Tihao. You’ve heard this, haven’t you?”

No one spoke. They feared it was a dismissal meeting.

Su Nantian clapped his hands, drawing their attention. “Don’t be afraid. These rumors are false.”

A man raised his hand, asking: “But the finance director left mysteriously. That’s not fake, is it? An executive’s departure without notice—how can we ignore this?”

Su Nantian admired his courage. “I’m here to explain Zhang Feng’s departure.” He signaled Qi Yinzhen, who distributed documents.

“Read this carefully,” Su Nantian said. “It shows Zhang Feng’s falsified accounts and the damage he caused.”

As Qi Yinzhen projected evidence, Su Nantian explained: “Zhang Feng colluded with Ke Mao, siphoning profits. This is why I dismissed him. I could’ve handed him over, but I spared him to let him repay the losses.”

The executives relaxed. Su Nantian’s words reassured them.

“Don’t fear I’ll fire you all,” he said. “But if anyone threatens Tihao, I won’t hesitate.”

With that, he left.

Chapter 445: Journey to Kyoto

Su Nantian’s haste wasn’t for idle reasons—it was to rescue Wu You’er. With Tihao resolved, he left Hangcheng immediately for Kyoto.

Before departing, he visited Wen Ran, asking her to stay in Hangcheng. He entrusted Tihao’s management to Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yeyu of the Shadow Assassins.

Wen Ran nodded, assuring him: “Don’t worry. I’ll watch over Hangcheng.”

With her support, Su Nantian felt renewed energy.

The flight to Kyoto took two hours, including delays. Upon arrival, Song Yang met him. Though the Dragon Group had a presence in Kyoto, Su Nantian avoided involving them, not wanting to entangle his personal matters.

Song Yang dressed modestly, wearing sunglasses and casual clothes. Su Nantian greeted him, then they drove to a hotel under Song’s family.

The hotel was secure, but Su Nantian knew Song Liachen wouldn’t betray him. Their alliance was clear.

Su Nantian didn’t immediately seek Wu You’er. Instead, he studied Song Liachen’s documents—family rivalries and secrets. This was his key to infiltrating the Wu family.

He needed a faction to ally with. The four major families—Nan Gong, Wang, Huang, and Song—had complex ties. He ruled out Song due to their alliance.

Nan Gong and Wang were rivals, but Huang was an enemy of Wu. Choosing the right family was crucial.

After careful consideration, Su Nantian chose Nan Gong. He planned to infiltrate through their daughter, Nan Gong Yuyan, who frequented the Tian Shui Building.

Chapter 446: Tian Shui Building

Su Nantian pored over the documents, noting Nan Gong and Wang’s past collaborations. Huang, however, was a bitter enemy of Wu.

He needed to choose one family to infiltrate. The Tian Shui Building was a gateway—candidates showcased their skills there, hoping for Nan Gong’s favor.

Su Nantian decided to go. He informed Song Yang he’d go alone, as his presence might expose him.

The taxi driver, a local, asked: “You here to impress Nan Gong?”

Su Nantian smiled. “My mentor told me to come here.”

The driver, familiar with the building’s secrets, warned: “Only two have succeeded. It’s no easy task.”

Su Nantian replied confidently, “I’ll show them my skills.”

Chapter 447: Prime Location

After a half-hour drive, Su Nantian arrived at the Tian Shui Building. The driver wished him luck before leaving.

The building was ancient, a protected site built during the imperial era. It remained Nan Gong’s property despite being state-owned.

Inside, a server greeted him: “Come for dinner or to watch the selection?”

Su Nantian asked if both were possible. The server arranged a prime seat overlooking the stage, where Nan Gong’s son and daughter would choose candidates.

Su Nantian ordered dishes and waited. Though the selection began late, he remained patient.

When the Nan Gong siblings arrived, escorted by attendants, Su Nantian felt his moment had come. He was ready to prove himself.
