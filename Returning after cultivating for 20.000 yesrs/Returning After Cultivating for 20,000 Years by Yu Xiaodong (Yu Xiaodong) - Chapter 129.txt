Though it was merely a discussion of the plan, they still had to proceed from reality and assess what each family could realistically bear. Even if the bid proposal was written beautifully, failure to implement it in practice would only invite trouble. Therefore, they had to thoroughly discuss this matter.

After discussing for some time, the group felt weary. Wu Chuan said he would go fetch tea to refresh them, so the room was left with only Nan Gong Ping, Su Nantian, and Wu You'er.

Su Nantian naturally had much to say to Wu You'er, but due to Nan Gong Ping's presence, he could not speak directly. Thus, Su Nantian resorted to riddles.

"I just heard Master Wu say that Miss Wu, you did not live in the Wu family before. Now that you have arrived at the Wu household, do you feel any differences?" Su Nantian's questions were all mundane, merely inquiring about Wu You'er.

Wu You'er smiled and replied, "Though there are many differences compared to the past, my previous home was merely ordinary. How could it compare to the Wu family's grandeur?"

"May I ask, where are your parents now that you're here?" Su Nantian's question was actually to inquire if Wu You'er had received news of Wu Tao and his wife.

"They are not accustomed to the Wu family's environment, so they do not live with me. My uncle also said that my father once wished to escape the Wu family, so naturally he would not return."

After saying this, Wu You'er's gaze carried a hint of melancholy, as she had received no news about Wu Tao and his wife for some time.

Wu You'er could have met her parents periodically, but Wu Chuan said he was too busy and needed to focus on the collaboration with the Nan Gong family, so for now, he forbade Wu You'er from meeting her parents.

Upon hearing Wu You'er's answer, Su Nantian understood the situation. It seemed Wu You'er had not met her parents for a while.

"Leaving one's familiar family to live in an unfamiliar environment requires courage. However, the Wu family's conditions are far superior to ordinary lives, so it is a blessing," Nan Gong Ping suddenly interjected.

Nan Gong Ping was naturally unaware that Su Nantian and Wu You'er were playing riddles, so he spoke casually.

Yet at that moment, Wu Chuan returned. Seeing Nan Gong Ping speaking with Wu You'er, he felt another plan stir within him.

Originally, Wu Chuan had told Wu You'er that after two years of her stepping down, he would become the family head and let them return. However, upon seeing Nan Gong Ping and Wu You'er conversing amicably, he thought that using Wu Yuer as a marriage tool to the Nan Gong family would better consolidate his position and gain support from the Nan Gong family.

But this was a matter for later. For now, the most critical issue was the wetland park bid.

After further discussion, they finally determined the preliminary direction of the bid plan. The Wu family and Nan Gong family would each take on different parts based on their strengths, but naturally, the Nan Gong family took the larger share. After all, the Wu family's strength was limited and their focus differed.

However, they默契ly avoided discussing the allocation ratio, as it was not their current priority. Though this part was crucial, it was unsuitable for discussion now.

Only after they successfully won the bid would the focus shift to this issue.

From then on, Su Nantian had no opportunity to speak with Wu You'er again. If he approached her alone, it would seem odd. Thus, Su Nantian followed Nan Gong Ping out of the Wu household.

On their way back, Nan Gong Ping said with some bewilderment, "Wu Chuan seems to have changed today. When I arrived earlier, I thought he would give me a setback, but later he showed much care and even flattered me. It's really hard to figure out his mind."

Wu Chuan's starkly different attitude left Nan Gong Ping puzzled about Wu Chuan's true intentions.

"This is Wu Chuan's cunning. At first, he truly wanted to give you a setback, but we managed to defuse it. So later, he changed his approach and made you feel more amiable. But this is merely a sugar-coated cannon," Su Nantian said.

Chapter 645: Seeing Through

After hearing Su Nantian's words, Nan Gong Ping suddenly awoke. Wu Chuan was indeed trying to lower his guard. Fortunately, he had become more cautious this time. If not for his changed mindset, he would have thought Wu Chuan was being kind.

"This Wu Chuan is truly cunning. Does he think I'm still as naive as before?" Nan Gong Ping said, somewhat angry.

Yet Su Nantian merely held back his laughter, as in his eyes, Nan Gong Ping had made no progress.

After Su Nantian and Nan Gong Ping left, Wu Chuan pondered deeply.

"Did you see his reaction? Having Nan Lin accompany Nan Gong Ping is indeed clever. Knowing his son was talentless, he sent this person to assist him. But I wonder if Nan Lin has the ability to control this man."

Wu Chuan recalled their experiences and felt Su Nantian's performance was indeed remarkable.

"Master, this person named Nan Tian is no ordinary man. I wonder why he entered the Nan Gong family as a bodyguard. A person like this would never hold such a position in any clan. I think he has his own designs on the Nan Gong family. We can take advantage of him."

Wu Chuan's assistant nodded and shared his thoughts.

From the start, they had felt Su Nantian's identity was unusual. A person with such strategy and wisdom would never be content as a mere bodyguard.

"This man is truly terrifying. In terms of strategy and wisdom, he already appears formidable. Moreover, when they came to our Wu family as guests, his combat skills were top-tier. A person like this should not be confined to the position of a bodyguard. Do you think it's possible?"

After saying this, Wu Chuan wore an enigmatic expression. He had basically concluded that Su Nantian's entry into the Nan Gong family must have its own designs, though he had hidden it well so far.

"But what exactly is this man after? How could he have concealed it so effectively?" Wu Chuan's assistant said again.

However, after hearing this, Wu Chuan shook his head and gave a meaningfully smiling face.

"Do you think we would miss it while Nan Lin wouldn't? If he hadn't noticed, he wouldn't be in this position. The Nan Gong family would not be a dominant force like other clans."

Wu Chuan's words made his assistant puzzled, who then said, "So your meaning is that Nan Lin already knew he was suspicious but deliberately didn't expose him."

"Indeed, Nan Lin must have noticed something amiss with this boy. However, he hasn't yet figured out what his purpose is within the Nan Gong family. But now this boy still holds value for the Nan Gong family, so they've kept him in that position. At the same time, they're watching his movements closely and would never let him harm the Nan Gong family."

Wu Chuan said this while wearing a few sly expressions. He had actually considered the matter quite thoroughly, naturally knowing that both sides would notice Su Nantian's oddities.

"But if this is the case, won't we lose our chance to collaborate with this boy? Won't Nan Lin discover it?"

After hearing Wu Chuan's words, his assistant frowned. It seemed their cooperation would not proceed.

Yet Wu Chuan smiled and shook his head, sipping tea leisurely before saying, "That's not necessarily true. Although the Nan Gong family has suspicions about this boy, if we act discreetly enough, they won't discover it. I believe this boy is quite clever. He's already been watched, so he'll be even more cautious and careful. As long as we do our part, no one will find out."

At this point, Wu Chuan stood up and patted his assistant's shoulder, saying, "This boy will likely visit the inland port again to wrap things up. After all, he needs to transfer from there, and some matters need to be handed over. Let someone contact him then to see if there's an opportunity for you to meet him alone and test his stance."

"Understood, Master. Please entrust this matter to me."

After hearing his assistant's words, Wu Chuan nodded in relief. His assistant had been with him for over a decade and was always experienced and steady, so he felt at ease entrusting this matter to him. Moreover, the task was not difficult.

"Then if that's the case, you should get ready immediately."

With Wu Chuan's command, his assistant nodded and left, presumably to prepare for the meeting with Su Nantian.

Indeed, as Wu Chuan had predicted, Su Nantian had to return to the inland port for final handovers. The Nan Gong family had already sent someone else to take over, but he still needed to brief others. Moreover, Su Nantian had been the one representing them with Li Zhe and others for a long time. Now that he was leaving, it was necessary to leave some deterrents; otherwise, there might be a situation where Li Zhe rebelled after Su Nantian's departure.

Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo were secondary concerns, as their influence was limited. Li Zhe would certainly be cautious of them and prevent them from rising again, but with regard to Li Zhe himself, it was uncertain. Li Zhe would not do anything too extreme but might play tricks. Therefore, before leaving the inland port to accompany Nan Gong Ping with the wetland bid project, Su Nantian had to return to the inland port and give Li Zhe a warning, making him realize that he could not act recklessly just because Su Nantian had left.

Su Nantian wanted Li Zhe to know that his current position was entirely due to the Nan Gong family's support. Without the Nan Gong family, Li Zhe would still be the weakest local power in the inland port. Therefore, if Li Zhe attempted any changes, the Nan Gong family would not hesitate to support another local power. Plus, Wang Bo had long been eager to befriend the Nan Gong family, making it another tool to warn Li Zhe.

However, Su Nantian felt that Li Zhe was quite honest. Still, this warning step could not be omitted. Moreover, the person currently most visibly stationed in the inland port was Nan Gong Fei, a fool. Thus, it was necessary to do so.

Chapter 646: Warning

Yet after meeting with Wu Chuan, Su Nantian felt strange. He sensed that Wu Chuan had been observing him intentionally or unintentionally, which made Su Nantian feel uneasy.

Because Su Nantian had entered the Nan Gong family with the purpose of contacting the Wu family. At that time, he hadn't chosen to enter the Wu family because his plan was to expose Wu You'er and Wu Tao's parents during their succession contest. At that time, entering the Wu family would have been too obvious, so he chose to take a roundabout path through the Nan Gong family.

But later, things became more complicated. Thus, he had to continue staying in the Nan Gong family. However, his choice was still correct because now he had more opportunities to contact the Wu family.

Moreover, this cooperation involved Wu You'er as a nominal family member, giving them an official meeting opportunity instead of secretly passing messages. This decision was Wu Chuan's own, not something Su Nantian and his group had planned. Thus, it would not raise suspicion.

But today's continuous observation by Wu Chuan made Su Nantian feel uneasy. He didn't know why Wu Chuan had suddenly paid so much attention to him. Although he and Nan Gong Ping had come together, he was merely a subordinate of Nan Gong Ping. Thus, Wu Chuan's attention made him suspect whether he had seen through his intentions.

However, after calming down, Su Nantian realized he shouldn't scare himself. He had hidden well within the Nan Gong family, and he knew Nan Lin would definitely suspect him; otherwise, why had they set so many tests for him? But they absolutely wouldn't guess that he was approaching the Wu family within the Nan Gong family.

Therefore, if even Nan Lin couldn't figure it out, how could Wu Chuan, so far away from him, understand after meeting him?

Thus, Wu Chuan immediately put his mind at ease. However, he still had doubts about why Wu Chuan was so interested in him. But he knew if his intuition was correct, Wu Chuan would soon reveal his true intentions.

Therefore, this matter didn't need Su Nantian to worry too much. He just needed to proceed with his own steps.

Su Nantian arrived at the inland port as scheduled for the final handover. At that time, a new person from the Nan Gong family had already arrived. This man wore glasses and appeared meticulous, suggesting that Nan Lin's intention was to institutionalize the management of the inland port.

After some data handover with him, Su Nantian took him to meet Li Zhe. After all, the inland port was now under his control; naturally, he had to introduce this new person to Li Zhe so that he would recognize him and not deny it later.

However, upon hearing from his subordinates that Su Nantian had brought a stranger over, Li Zhe probably already guessed Su Nantian's intention.

"How have you been lately?" After arriving, Su Nantian didn't directly address the issue but greeted Li Zhe first. They had some rapport.

"All is well, nothing special has happened. But you haven't come for a few days," Li Zhe smiled and said, naturally feeling like Su Nantian's subordinate since he had been promoted by Su Nantian.

"South Palace has been busy recently, and the matters in the inland port have basically been resolved. So I don't need to be here much anymore. Now, a new person has arrived. I brought him over to get familiar with the place and let you get acquainted, so you won't be surprised later."

After saying this, Su Nantian immediately pointed to the person beside him and said, "This is the one who will be responsible for all matters of the South Palace in the inland port. He's surnamed Liu."

This man spoke with meticulousness, completely professional and formal, unlike Su Nantian who could joke around. You might feel a bit unaccustomed because he had climbed up from the grassroots, so he wasn't very adept at dealing with such serious people.

But Li Zhe still smiled and shook hands with him, saying, "I'm Li Zhe. Please look after me."

"Have you already understood the situation in the inland port? Li Zhe is currently the most powerful force here. Therefore, many matters of the South Palace in the inland port will rely on Li Zhe's cooperation. However, we are already old acquaintances and have collaborated well. From now on, you just need to follow the usual procedures for negotiations. There's nothing special; you can maintain contact and build relationships."

Su Nantian said this while walking beside Li Zhe and patting his shoulder.

"From now on, I won't be in the inland port anymore. I'll miss you a lot. But please stay good, don't give me a chance to return. It's quite far from the South Palace; it takes an hour to drive each time."

Su Nantian's expression was smiling, but his words were clear. He was telling Li Zhe not to cause trouble for him. If Li Zhe caused problems for the South Palace, he would return at any time to deal with him.

An hour's drive might seem long, but it also told Li Zhe that he would be immediately aware of any events in the inland port, needing only an hour to return from the South Palace.

Li Zhe understood Su Nantian's meaning well and nodded with a smile, saying, "I know you've worked hard. I definitely won't cause trouble for you. You can rest assured. We all win, and I know who to be grateful to. So you can definitely rest easy; I won't cause trouble for anyone, and causing trouble for myself is the same as causing trouble for you."

After hearing Li Zhe's words, Su Nantian felt somewhat relieved. Although Li Zhe's promise did not guarantee he wouldn't cause trouble later, at least Li Zhe clearly understood that he would not easily provoke Su Nantian or the South Palace, as it would be detrimental to him.

Chapter 647: Passing a Message

Su Nantian's warning to Li Zhe was indeed effective, and Li Zhe expressed his loyalty. Even after Su Nantian left, he would not betray the South Palace.

After completing his mission, Su Nantian was about to leave when Li Zhe patted his shoulder and said, "Big Brother Tian, wait a moment. I have something to say to you."

Li Zhe's words clearly indicated he wanted to speak with Su Nantian alone.

Although Su Nantian understood Li Zhe's intention, he didn't know what specific matter Li Zhe had to discuss. However, he still said to the person beside him, "You go back first."

The man was tactful and nodded before leaving. Only Su Nantian and Li Zhe remained in the room.

"Speak up, what else do you need to tell me? I don't care about the inland port anymore. If there's something, it's too late now," Su Nantian said, thinking Li Zhe was referring to the inland port.

"No, it's not about the inland port. I want to pass on a message for you," Li Zhe smiled and rubbed his hands.

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian was startled. The only person who could have asked Li Zhe to pass a message for him was from the Wu family.

But what exactly did the Wu family want with him? That was what Su Nantian found most intriguing.

"Speak up, who did the Wu family send you to pass a message for me?" Su Nantian asked directly, not hiding anything.

Li Zhe was surprised after speaking. He hadn't even started talking yet, and Su Nantian had already guessed who sent him to pass the message.

Anyone with a keen mind would have realized that the person passing the message was from the Wu family. After all, the inland port belonged to the Wu family. Although it was currently under the South Palace's temporary control, in essence, the owner was still the Wu family.

Li Zhe was currently the most powerful local force in the inland port. Except for the Wu family, he almost didn't need to obey anyone else. Therefore, the person who asked him to pass a message must be of higher status than him. Who else but the Wu family?

"Big Brother Tian, you're really smart. I hadn't even started talking yet, and you already knew who sent me to pass the message. Actually, it's Mr. Li who asked you to have dinner with him tonight at Jin Hua Hotel. The best private room has already been reserved for you."

Li Zhe smiled and said this.

"Mr. Li? Who is Mr. Li?" Su Nantian asked curiously, as he didn't know many people from the Wu family. In fact, he had met some but didn't know their names.

"Oh, I forgot to tell you. Mr. Li is the assistant of our master," Li Zhe explained.

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian immediately connected the face with Mr. Li, who was Wu Chuan's assistant and had met him a few times.

It seemed that this time, it was indeed Wu Chuan's initiative to have his assistant meet Su Nantian again. Probably, it was about discussing the wetland bid matter because otherwise, Su Nantian couldn't think of anything else to talk about. Moreover, Su Nantian immediately understood that when he accompanied Nan Gong Ping to meet Wu Chuan before, Wu Chuan had been observing him because of this matter.

Li Zhe completed his mission by informing Su Nantian of the time and place. Now, whether Su Nantian went or not was no longer his concern.

Actually, it was because Wu Chuan couldn't directly find Su Nantian. Although they could hide in the room, the most important thing was to pass this message to Su Nantian.

If they openly searched for Su Nantian in the inland port, it would be monitored by others. After all, the South Palace had been closely watching Su Nantian.

But through Li Zhe's message, it was safe. Moreover, since Li Zhe had a relationship with Su Nantian, their private conversation wouldn't be suspected.

"Alright, thank you. I already know," Su Nantian nodded after hearing this and left immediately.

Su Nantian definitely chose to attend the meeting that night. He wanted to see what the Wu family wanted with him, and this might be an opportunity to further strengthen his relationship with the Wu family and allow him to rescue Wu You'er and Wu Tao's parents.

After learning from Li Zhe that Wu Chuan's assistant had invited him, Su Nantian arrived at the designated hotel as scheduled. After informing the server of Mr. Li's name, the server respectfully led him into the private room.

It must be said that this hotel was definitely among the top in the map. Not only was the environment extremely luxurious, but the privacy of these private rooms was also strictly maintained.

Su Nantian encountered several security teams on his way, all stationed at fixed points to fully protect the privacy of these rooms. Even when led by a server, they had to show their access cards at each checkpoint.

Of course, the regular dining areas outside weren't this strict. Only these private rooms had such measures.

Therefore, if one didn't come to dine but only wanted to find someone, they would be at a loss in these secret private rooms.

After being led by the server to their private room, Su Nantian saw a person sitting inside. This person's face was very familiar to him because he had already met Wu Chuan's assistant before, although they hadn't spoken.

"South Tian, you're here. Come and sit!" Wu Chuan's assistant stood up from his seat immediately upon seeing Su Nantian, greeting him with a warm wave.

Su Nantian smiled and walked over, saying, "Sorry, Mr. Li, I'm a bit late. Did I keep you waiting?"

"Where is the need for that? I was already happy to see you. I originally thought you might not come, but now I'm very glad to meet you."

After saying this, Wu Chuan's assistant waved to the server and signaled him to start serving.

"I think Mr. Li shouldn't have any strange things. Just say it directly. Why bother with subtleties? You know I can't stay here for long, after all, I still need to return to the South Palace."

Su Nantian was curious about what this person wanted, so he spoke directly.

Chapter 648: Tempting Conditions

Wu Chuan's assistant was clearly unprepared for Su Nantian's directness. In his few times meeting Su Nantian and remembering him, he had always been very perceptive in understanding hidden meanings. Thus, Wu Chuan's assistant believed he was a person who liked to be indirect. But he hadn't expected that Su Nantian would immediately come straight to the point.

"Haha, I never thought you had such a straightforward personality. You're so direct," Wu Chuan's assistant laughed and said.

"I just think it's better not to waste everyone's time. If there's something, say it directly. There's no need for subtleties. After all, in the end, you still have to talk about these things, right? And you know my time is limited. If I return late, our meeting today will inevitably be exposed."

Su Nantian smiled. He was constantly guessing this person's intentions, and he had several rough ideas but wasn't particularly certain.

"Then I'll say it directly. Now, the South Palace and Wu family are collaborating on this wetland bid plan. The first phase is naturally to work together to win the bid. We can guarantee that in this stage, the Wu family will definitely cooperate with the South Palace. After all, only by doing this first can we have food to eat. If we fail at the end, it would be a complete waste of effort."

Wu Chuan's assistant said this. Wu Chuan was clearly aware of the situation, knowing that if they couldn't unite against the outside in the first stage and win the bid, then no matter how much they fought later, it would be in vain.

After hearing this, Su Nantian nodded in approval and said, "It seems Master Wu is not a reckless man. He clearly understands the importance of priorities and knows that in this matter, we must cooperate first to win the bid before discussing later matters."

"I believe with the combined strength of the South Palace and Wu family, this matter is basically a sure thing. However, both sides will not be complacent and will definitely bring their strongest preparations to face this bid. But I think you know that once we successfully win the project, it's then that our mutual competition between the Wu family and South Palace begins."

After saying this, Wu Chuan's assistant smiled and looked meaningfully at Su Nantian.

"So you're saying that Master Wu asked you to come and try to recruit me? I guessed correctly, right?"

Actually, Su Nantian had two guesses before. One was that Wu Chuan wanted his assistant to approach him to try and recruit him, so the Wu family could gain more advantages in the allocation after winning the wetland bid. The other guess was that Wu Chuan might have discovered his intentions, known about his plan to rescue Wu You'er and Wu Tao's parents, and used it as a leverage to have him work undercover for the Wu family.

But now it seemed Su Nantian had overthought. The other idea was too complicated, but he hadn't exposed any clues so far. Except for Nan Gong Yayan catching him talking to Wu You'er, no one else had found out his intentions. Everyone suspected his identity but hadn't found any evidence yet.

"Indeed, you're a smart person. Yes, Master Wu asked me to come and see if we could cooperate. Naturally, we will offer very favorable conditions for you, hoping you can consider it."

Wu Chuan's assistant said this. However, he didn't know that Su Nantian was extremely excited inside.

This opportunity gave him a chance to get closer to the Wu family, allowing him to have more chances to rescue Wu You'er and Wu Tao's parents.

Therefore, Su Nantian naturally supported this proposal. However, he couldn't immediately agree on the surface. The faster he agreed, the more suspicion Wu Chuan would have. He wouldn't suspect that Su Nantian had designs on the Wu family, but he would suspect it was a counterintelligence tactic arranged by the South Palace.

After hearing this, Su Nantian immediately made a thoughtful expression and said after a while, "You said you have very favorable conditions. What are the specific conditions? If I cooperate with you, the risk is huge. My advantage in the South Palace is your cooperation's strength, but it's also my danger. If I'm discovered later, I could be subdued by the South Palace in seconds."

Su Nantian deliberately showed a very difficult expression, actually letting the other party know he was hesitant on this issue.

"Of course, if we don't offer you enough incentives, how could you agree to cooperate with us? The reward is naturally essential. If you can help us Wu family this time, we are willing to offer three million."

Upon hearing this number, Su Nantian was stunned. Three million wasn't much for his own wealth, but the Wu family could offer three million just to have someone help them with this wetland bid's allocation. It was enough to show how much profit this wetland bid would bring them.

Wu Chuan's assistant saw Su Nantian's reaction and was a bit doubtful, thinking this amount might not satisfy him. So he continued, "Of course, if you have any other requests, feel free to propose them. Everything is negotiable. Three million is just our base price. Moreover, if you're willing, after this cooperation, you can leave the South Palace and join us Wu family. We will employ you, and if the South Palace investigates, we will fully protect you."

After hearing Wu Chuan's assistant's words, Su Nantian was stunned. This condition was extremely tempting for him. Money wasn't important to him, as his wealth was already substantial. Three million was just a drop in the bucket for him. But if he could truly enter the Wu family, that was what he needed most.

After all, Su Nantian's goal now was to rescue Wu You'er and Wu Tao's parents.

Chapter 649: Playing the Game

It must be said that the conditions Wu Chuan's assistant proposed were extremely tempting for Su Nantian. Money didn't matter; he had finally found an opportunity to enter the Wu family openly, which was what he needed most.

However, Su Nantian knew that even with such tempting conditions, he could never cooperate with them. Because he had a secret in Nan Gong Yayan's hands. If he truly betrayed the South Palace and joined the Wu family, then Nan Gong Yayan could expose his secret at any time.

At that point, Su Nantian would be caught between two enemies. Without the South Palace's protection and falling into the Wu family's hands, he wouldn't only fail to rescue Wu You'er and Wu Tao's parents but also face a major threat to his safety. Therefore, he could never agree to the Wu family's current request for cooperation.

Thus, even though this condition was extremely tempting for Su Nantian, he still couldn't agree.

Su Nantian continued to appear very hesitant and said nothing. Wu Chuan's assistant also wore an understanding expression, saying, "Master Su, I know you're struggling internally. I don't require an immediate answer. As long as you come to me before we complete the bid, I can fulfill these promises. Moreover, if you have any requests, feel free to fully propose them. We will definitely consider them. If it's something we Wu family can do, we'll certainly agree without hesitation. Therefore, you don't need to be troubled now. You have plenty of time to think it over. I hope we can have a cooperation."

Wu Chuan's assistant knew that pressing Su Nantian now would make him hesitate more. Instead, giving him some time to think and struggle would increase the probability of his cooperation.

Therefore, Wu Chuan's assistant used this soft approach, allowing Su Nantian to not give an immediate answer and instead go back to think it over.

"Thank you, then I'll go back and consider it. This matter is indeed very significant. I can't give you an immediate answer."

Su Nantian said this and stood up.

"Since the matter is now concluded, I understand your intention. I'll leave now," Su Nantian said and extended his hand to Wu Chuan's assistant. After shaking hands, he nodded and left the private room, guided by a server to the entrance.

Seeing Su Nantian leave, Wu Chuan's assistant immediately took out his phone and called Wu Chuan.

"How did it go?" Upon seeing his assistant's call, Wu Chuan knew what the matter was and asked immediately.

"Exactly as you thought. This boy didn't directly tell me his answer, but I saw he was very hesitant. He must have been moved by these conditions. However, since he's been in the South Palace for a long time, he must have experienced the South Palace's strength. Therefore, he is hesitating between them.

Moreover, as you said, he must have his own designs in the South Palace. Therefore, before he completes his tasks there or finds a replacement for his interests in the South Palace, he won't easily agree to us. Therefore, I think he will likely raise his demands next."

After hearing his assistant's words, Wu Chuan nodded. He was not surprised and said, "This is expected. As long as he can bear it, we'll agree to his demands. Gaining him on our side is a crucial matter for us."

"You can rest assured, I understand. I'll go back and report the detailed situation to you." After saying this, Wu Chuan's assistant hung up the phone.
