“Because Li Zhe was fully aware that this opportunity arose because the Nan Gong Family had suddenly taken control of the Inland Harbor, he realized that if the Wu family had continued to dominate the Inland Harbor for a lifetime, he would have never had such a chance to break through.”

Though it was only one year, he believed that once he had taken the first step, the entire trend of the Inland Harbor would shift. Even if the Nan Gong Family eventually left and the Wu family reclaimed power, as long as he could govern his subordinates well, it would not be a problem.

Thus, at this moment, he could only rely on the Nan Gong Family's influence to fulfill his ambition of expanding his power. For him, this was an unparalleled opportunity because he understood that the business in the Inland Harbor would always be controlled by the Wu family. Therefore, he must seize this chance and make full use of it.

Since Su Nantian had already negotiated with the Nan Gong Family on behalf of Li Zhe, the next step was simple. They only needed to follow their initial plan and execute it step by step.

After Su Nantian concluded his discussion with Li Zhe, he returned to the Nan Gong Family and immediately found Nan Gong Yuyan. He informed her of the day's negotiations and told her that Li Zhe had agreed to cooperate with the Nan Gong Family.

Nan Gong Yuyan was quite satisfied upon hearing this and immediately led Su Nantian to find Nan Gong Lin, reporting the progress of the day.

“Now that the beginning has been decided, proceed as you previously said. As for funding, let Yuyan directly transfer some money to you. Be sure to seize this opportunity well. If this matter is handled properly, the transaction between Nan Gong Ping and the Wu family will also require your presence. You should know that from now on, you may no longer be just a simple bodyguard. Work hard.”

After saying this, Nan Gong Lin stood up and patted Nan Gong Yuyan's shoulder with a smile: “Keep a close eye on this kid. Alright, it’s late, I’ll go rest now.”

Chapter 618: Exceeding Expectations

Once Nan Gong Lin had spoken, Nan Gong Yuyan immediately transferred the funds to Su Nantian without hesitation.

Su Nantian then took the money directly to Li Zhe. Upon seeing the full payment, Li Zhe immediately began working with Su Nantian on their plan.

“Do you have people under your command who are talkative and prone to spreading rumors?” After meeting Li Zhe, Su Nantian immediately asked this question.

“You must be joking. There are plenty of such people. Why do you need them?” Li Zhe was confused, unsure why their crucial plan would require such individuals.

“You can’t possibly go out openly and tell these people you want to expand your power and have them switch sides. Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo would immediately target you and crush you. Instead, you need to send people secretly to spread the news. Moreover, you must inform them that your rewards will be increased by a certain amount. Especially tonight, have them bring a group of willing people to the hotel I’ve booked. Give them money immediately to convince them, but don’t let them come right away—have them return and spread the news instead.”

Su Nantian’s plan had already been carefully thought through. Compared to openly recruiting, a covert viral spread was far more likely to attract people willing to switch sides.

Moreover, Su Nantian had no fear of Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo using the same tactics. Compared to money, the Nan Gong Family had no reason to be afraid. Additionally, Su Nantian had already predicted all the expenses for this operation and had applied for the maximum amount.

Upon hearing Su Nantian’s words, Li Zhe understood and nodded: “You can rest easy. I’ll go find people now. I’ll bring them back tonight.”

After saying this, Li Zhe immediately left hurriedly to find people as per Su Nantian’s request.

Meanwhile, Su Nantian returned leisurely to his office, needing only to observe the results of that night.

By evening, Su Nantian and Li Zhe entered the hotel room he had booked, waiting for the people Li Zhe had found to bring new recruits.

However, before anyone arrived, they heard a commotion outside, as if the staff were arguing with someone.

Su Nantian felt something was amiss upon hearing this noise and stepped out of the room. But when he saw what was happening outside, he didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

Because Su Nantian saw about thirty or more workers from the Inland Harbor standing outside. This number was far more than he had anticipated, and he hadn’t expected to gain so many people on the first day.

Secondly, when Su Nantian looked back at the room he had booked, these people would easily fill it to capacity.

“What’s going on outside?” Li Zhe also curiously stuck his head out.

“Is this person one of yours? He’s brought people over.” Although Su Nantian knew these were workers from the Inland Harbor, since they had been recruited by Li Zhe, he still needed him to take responsibility.

Upon hearing this, Li Zhe immediately stood up and leaned out of the door. Seeing that the leader was indeed one of the people he had found, he turned to Su Nantian and said: “Yes, they are my people.”

But at this moment, the hotel staff took out a walkie-talkie and said: “Security, hurry up. We can’t stop these dozens of people. We don’t know what they’re here for.”

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian immediately walked over to Li Zhe and said: “I’m really sorry. I didn’t expect so many people to come today. Originally, I just wanted them to bring two or three people for entertainment. These are all my people. You don’t need to call the security.”

The staff turned around and saw it was Su Nantian, a prestigious guest who had booked the room. Immediately, he said into the walkie-talkie: “It was a misunderstanding. No need to come up.”

Then, the staff turned back with a smile and said: “In that case, we were mistaken. Let them come over immediately. Is your room too small to accommodate so many people? Would you like me to arrange a larger one for you?”

“No need, it’s quite troublesome to move people in and out. Let’s just do this for now,” Su Nantian said with a smile to the staff. However, at that moment, Li Zhe waved his hand to signal the group to come in.

Indeed, as Su Nantian had predicted earlier, when he and Li Zhe sat down again and saw the group of people standing before them, the entire room was packed.

“Old boss, everyone here is willing to come over. I’ve brought them as per your instructions,” the man at the front said with a sly grin, addressing Li Zhe.

Su Nantian looked at this man and couldn’t help but admire him internally—this man was clearly a big talker, otherwise he wouldn’t have recruited so many people.

“Alright, I understand.” Li Zhe nodded after hearing this.

Then Li Zhe addressed the more than thirty people in front of him: “We’ve all worked together in the Inland Harbor, so I won’t introduce myself. You know what this meeting is about. We can offer you better treatment, adding five hundred yuan to your monthly salary. So you should join my ranks. Do you understand?”

Li Zhe spoke according to the price he had agreed with Su Nantian earlier, and these workers were only willing to switch sides for this five hundred yuan.

This five hundred yuan might seem like a small amount to others, but for these dockworkers in the Inland Harbor, it was a precious sum. If they could gain five hundred more yuan by switching sides, they would naturally be willing. Moreover, they had no personal feelings towards Zhang Yuan or Wang Bo; they worked under them only because it made their strength stronger, allowing them to avoid being bullied or earn more money than others.

“He told us everything you said, and they are willing to join your ranks,” the leader said with a sly grin, as if boasting.

However, at this moment, Su Nantian directly took out three hundred yuan from his wallet and extended it toward the man, saying: “You did a great job. Naturally, I can’t let you go without compensation. Take this three hundred yuan first.”

The man saw Su Nantian giving him money and immediately looked stunned, as Li Zhe had never mentioned this before.

Chapter 619: Expanding the Spread

This three hundred yuan was certainly not much to Su Nantian, but for these dockworkers in the Inland Harbor, it was a significant sum. Gaining hundreds of yuan without effort was something these workers would be delighted about.

Li Zhe hadn’t told him about this temporary payment, as it was Su Nantian’s spontaneous idea. Seeing so many workers from the Inland Harbor arrive, he felt it necessary to give a small reward to the person who had brought them in. Additionally, Su Nantian thought of a strategy to spread this news quickly and attract more people into Li Zhe’s ranks within a short time.

Under the envious glances of other workers, the leader took the three hundred yuan and said: “Thank you, thank you.”

Those behind him naturally also wanted more money. At this moment, they were all watching Su Nantian with longing eyes, hoping to get some money from him as well. After all, this man had told them that joining Li Zhe’s ranks would give them an extra five hundred yuan per month.

At this moment, Li Zhe cleared his throat and addressed everyone: “I believe all of you came here knowing the conditions we’ve offered. If you work under me in the Inland Harbor now, I’ll give you an extra five hundred yuan per month. You can be completely assured of this. Once you officially join my ranks, I’ll immediately兑现 your salary.”

After saying this, Li Zhe turned to Su Nantian and pointed at him: “As for the rest of the matters, everyone should listen to him. I think you’re all familiar with this man—he is the boss of the Nan Gong Family. If you want to earn money, you must follow this boss of the Nan Gong Family.”

At this moment, Li Zhe didn’t hide Su Nantian’s identity at all, even directly stating that he was a member of the Nan Gong Family. Actually, these workers in the Inland Harbor had no factional loyalty; whether it was the Wu family or the Nan Gong Family, they would follow whoever paid them.

In fact, it was even better if the one who gave them more money made them switch sides immediately. This wasn’t unusual for these workers, just like how people now switch jobs when another company offers better conditions.

At this moment, Su Nantian stood up and addressed everyone present: “In fact, you don’t need to care about who I am. I know your purpose here is only one—earning more money for yourselves. Now, I’m giving you this opportunity. I know the square is divided into three factions now. However, if you join Li Zhe’s ranks, your monthly salary will increase by five hundred yuan. Additionally, I have a benefit to offer you.”

Su Nantian’s words not only lifted the spirits of these workers but also left Li Zhe puzzled about what new plan Su Nantian had devised.

As everyone was watching Su Nantian, he smiled and said: “You all saw that I gave him three hundred yuan. Do you know where this money came from? It’s because of the number of people here—ten yuan per person, thirty people make three hundred. You don’t need to feel regretful or anxious; this money belongs to everyone. As long as you can bring people from your surroundings into Li Zhe’s ranks, it will be calculated at ten yuan per person. I hope you all spread this news secretly after returning home.”

“Then, when they bring their people over, not only will their salaries increase, but they’ll also get this additional income. I promise to deliver on my words.”

Actually, Su Nantian’s plan was a spontaneous idea. Relying on one person to recruit people might only reach an upper limit of thirty, but if everyone could earn money by recruiting, they would naturally all try their best. Thus, the number of people would grow rapidly.

Moreover, with the incentive of money, they would certainly work hard for their own satisfaction. Besides, there were only a few thousand people in the Inland Harbor; even if all of them joined, it would only cost ten thousand yuan. This was certainly not a big sum for Su Nantian or the Nan Gong Family, but it was an extra income for these workers.

Therefore, Su Nantian indeed borrowed the idea of a “mouse warehouse” from some business people—passing it on one by one, naturally expanding the range they could reach.

“Thus, the more people you can recruit into our ranks, the more money you’ll get. Did everyone understand?” Su Nantian asked after finishing his speech.

“Yes!” These workers nodded and responded, as they usually earned only over a hundred yuan per day of hard work. But now, if they joined Li Zhe’s ranks, not only would their monthly income increase, but they could also earn money by recruiting people. Why wouldn’t they take this opportunity?

Indeed, the conditions Su Nantian proposed were very tempting for them, and they were more than what they could get from Zhang Yuan or Wang Bo.

Actually, Su Nantian’s purpose in calling them here was precisely this—only a sudden inspiration made him refine his conditions further, and this method could help them expand their influence more quickly.

However, Su Nantian didn’t let these people join Li Zhe’s ranks immediately. He only recorded their names and told them to continue working at their original places for the next few days, but secretly they were still to spread this news and recruit more people.

All of this was Su Nantian’s plan to let the situation continue to ferment, and when the batch of goods arrived at the Inland Harbor, it would be time for them to make their move.

At that time, with so many people on their side, even if the other workers resisted, it would be a clash of swords. It wouldn’t just be the Nan Gong Family maintaining order; these workers would protect themselves to gain more benefits, and this nature was completely different from what they had originally planned.

Therefore, there would be no need to fear workers staging a revolt; naturally, another group of workers would suppress them.

Chapter 620: Confrontation

It was undeniable that Su Nantian’s plan worked very effectively. After these workers returned to their construction sites, they spread this news at a viral speed in secret.

Moreover, everyone kept the information confidential because if it failed, they wouldn’t get any money. These workers had no loyalty to the local tyrants; everything was for money, so they naturally chose to keep this secret for their own benefit.

However, even if these workers kept it a secret, the news would still reach Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo’s ears. After all, they had their own informants among these workers. These people received more money than the ordinary workers and were there to monitor their status constantly.

Therefore, within two days of this news spreading among the workers, it reached Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo’s ears.

“Old boss, these workers have been acting strangely lately, as if something was going on.” Liu Xi, an informant Zhang Yuan had placed among his workers to monitor their secret activities, reported this immediately after learning about the news.

At first, Zhang Yuan didn’t take it seriously and laughed: “What could these people possibly stir up? They’re just whispering about something in secret.”

Zhang Yuan hadn’t considered another possibility. After all, the three local tyrants had maintained their status in the Inland Harbor for many years. He was also aware that Wang Bo and Li Zhe both wanted to replace his position.

But Zhang Yuan’s lack of concern was because he had understood for many years that the situation in the Inland Harbor was difficult to break. To recruit these workers, one had to offer a large amount of money. However, neither Wang Bo nor Li Zhe had enough funds to entice people to switch sides. This was the most important reason why the situation in the Inland Harbor had remained stable for so long.

Seeing Zhang Yuan’s carefree attitude, Liu Xi frowned and said: “Old boss, this time is different. It seems like they really want to switch sides.”

Upon hearing Liu Xi’s words, Zhang Yuan suddenly became alert. He knew Liu Xi’s words were not baseless, so he asked: “What happened? How could they switch sides? Was it Wang Bo or Li Zhe who offered better conditions? They couldn’t have offered more than me.”

Zhang Yuan was full of questions in his heart. The only people who could have enticed his workers to switch sides were Wang Bo and Li Zhe. But he was well aware of their situations.

If they had only offered a small amount of money, his workers wouldn’t have taken the risk. Therefore, this time they must have offered better conditions than before. But how could they afford such a large sum with their financial situations?

“I heard them whispering about Li Zhe. They said Li Zhe was recruiting them and offering an extra few hundred yuan per month, around five hundred!” Liu Xi said while recalling what he had heard from the workers. Since Liu Xi was Zhang Yuan’s trusted subordinate, they naturally wouldn’t tell him about this matter; it would be like committing suicide.

“Did one person get five hundred more? Do you know how many people Li Zhe is recruiting this time? He couldn’t have recruited many, could he? Ten or so workers might be manageable, but if he wanted to recruit over a hundred people, how could he afford the cost?”

Upon hearing this amount, Zhang Yuan immediately guessed that Li Zhe wouldn’t recruit many people this time. Thus, the sense of crisis he had felt earlier disappeared instantly.

But Liu Xi looked serious and said: “Old boss, it seems like they want to recruit many people. I heard them say that recruiting people also comes with money, ten yuan per person. It seems like there’s no limit on the number.”

Upon hearing Liu Xi say this, Zhang Yuan’s heart lifted again. “How could that be? Where did Li Zhe get so much money? With so many people, each getting an extra five hundred yuan, it would drain him. I don’t believe it. You’re being tricked; this is just spreading false information to confuse our morale. Maybe this has nothing to do with Li Zhe at all; it might be Wang Bo, since she’s close to the Nan Gong Family. She might have used this to divide us.”

Upon hearing Liu Xi continue talking about the financial conditions, Zhang Yuan was even more doubtful. He also speculated that this might be Wang Bo using the Nan Gong Family to undermine their position in the Inland Harbor.

Liu Xi quickly said: “Old boss, I think we should investigate this. It’s definitely not baseless. I think it might be true, and they also told me in secret that if I hadn’t gone out to eavesdrop, I wouldn’t have heard this. Let’s just catch one person and question them.”

Upon hearing Liu Xi say this, Zhang Yuan felt the situation was worth investigating. Although he thought Li Zhe couldn’t afford so much money, he still agreed to Liu Xi’s suggestion.

“To be safe, let’s catch one person and investigate. Don’t just bring one; bring two.”

Upon hearing Zhang Yuan say this, Liu Xi nodded immediately and went to the dock to bring two workers over.

Liu Xi’s actions were quite fast, and he quickly brought two workers over. However, he didn’t tell them what they were being brought for; he just told them that Zhang Yuan wanted to see them.

These two workers were a bit confused and followed Liu Xi’s lead.

When they entered Zhang Yuan’s office, they saw that his expression was unusually bad. Naturally, they realized that this wasn’t something good.

“Old boss, I’ve brought the people for you. Just ask them directly.” Liu Xi at this moment fully played his role as a toady, smiling and flattering.

The two workers who were brought over were confused but didn’t know what was happening. However, they naturally felt some fear and confusion.

Chapter 621: Exposed in the Open

Actually, Zhang Yuan was somewhat annoyed by Liu Xi’s attitude. However, he had to keep such people in order to monitor his workers effectively.

“Alright, you can go now. I’ll ask them myself.” Zhang Yuan waved his hand at Liu Xi, indicating he could leave first.

“Okay, okay. Old boss, I’ll go now. If there’s anything else, just call me.” Liu Xi said and left.

After Liu Xi left, Zhang Yuan stared at the two workers standing below him without saying a word. He just looked at them, applying pressure to break their psychological defenses. This way, they would speak the truth.

The two workers looked at each other in confusion and felt uneasy under Zhang Yuan’s gaze.

At this moment, Zhang Yuan said: “You two should reflect and think about what mistake you’ve made recently?”

This was Zhang Yuan’s psychological warfare. He didn’t immediately ask the question he wanted to, but instead first broke their mental defenses so they would speak truthfully.

After a long silence, the two workers saw Zhang Yuan still watching them closely and finally said: “Old boss, what are you talking about? We really don’t know. We haven’t done anything wrong against you. We’ve been working hard recently.”

Although these two workers were also spreading the news about Li Zhe recruiting people in secret, they hadn’t switched sides yet. Therefore, they didn’t think they had done anything wrong. Moreover, to them, switching sides for more money was a normal thing and didn’t count as betraying Zhang Yuan.

“Think again, what have you been doing recently?” Upon seeing the two workers not speaking up, Zhang Yuan deliberately used a low voice to add more pressure.

But the two workers still didn’t understand, so Zhang Yuan had no choice but to stand up.

“Recently, what have you been whispering about? Li Zhe offered you better conditions to recruit you over, so you want to switch sides, right?”

Zhang Yuan said this with a fierce expression. Additionally, his loud voice when he slammed the table startled the two workers.

But upon hearing this, the two workers finally remembered that they had been recruiting people to join them and were given a fee for each person.

After all, in essence, it was just switching sides, so they didn’t think it was something shameful. However, now that Zhang Yuan said this, the two workers felt they had betrayed him.

Therefore, these two workers were now slightly trembling, not expecting that their actions would have such consequences.

Upon seeing the two workers’ expressions, Zhang Yuan was extremely satisfied. His intimidation had worked, and he would now get satisfactory answers when asking them questions.

“Alright, you two big guys don’t need to look like this anymore. Now I’ll ask you about these matters, and you must answer truthfully; otherwise, you’ll have a hard time.”

Zhang Yuan said this while pointing at them. The two men nodded immediately.

“Tell me, what conditions did Li Zhe offer to recruit you? Did Wang Bo get involved in this?”

Zhang Yuan thought that Li Zhe alone couldn’t fight against him, so it was likely Wang Bo and Li Zhe had put aside their differences. That’s why he asked this question, but Zhang Yuan didn’t know that this was actually Li Zhe alone.

“Yes, it was Li Zhe. He said if we followed him, he would give us an extra five hundred yuan per month. Additionally, for every person we recruited over, he would give ten yuan per head. There was nothing else. We’ve already started spreading this in secret, and quite a few workers are preparing to join.”

One of the workers honestly told Zhang Yuan everything he knew, and the other nodded repeatedly to confirm it was true.

“Is there anything else? Did Wang Bo get involved in this?” Upon hearing his answer, Zhang Yuan was somewhat surprised. He hadn’t expected it to be Li Zhe alone.

“We don’t know, but the message only mentioned Li Zhe’s side. There was no mention of Wang Bo recruiting people, right?” The worker said while scratching his head and looking at the other person beside him.

“Yes, we heard about going to Li Zhe’s side in secret. We don’t know if he has teamed up with Wang Bo.” The other worker said the same thing.

“Did he really say that each person would get an extra five hundred yuan per month? Did he mention any limits on the number of people?” Zhang Yuan continued to ask curiously, still not believing that Li Zhe had so much money to recruit people.

“Yes, he said exactly that. But there was no mention of a limit on the number of people; instead, he told us it would be better to recruit more.” This worker thought for a moment and answered.

“Did you get tricked by Li Zhe? Where did he get so much money for you?” Zhang Yuan still didn’t believe it.

“No, old boss. Someone has already joined them and seen Li Zhe. He was given the head money immediately, and they only believed it after seeing the money. This time, he convinced us to go with him. As for where this money came from? It seems it was from the Nan Gong Family. They said that on that night, the Nan Gong Family’s people were with Li Zhe.”

This worker was honest and told Zhang Yuan everything he had heard, even mentioning Su Nantian.

“What? You said the Nan Gong Family’s people were with Li Zhe?”

Upon hearing this, Zhang Yuan felt a bad feeling. If it was indeed the Nan Gong Family supporting Li Zhe, then Li Zhe truly had enough money to give these workers more.

“Previously, the data leak incident was Li Zhe and the Nan Gong Family secretly colluding. I didn’t expect this time to be exposed in the open, without even hiding it and coming directly with the Nan Gong Family to trick me.” Zhang Yuan muttered under his breath.

The previous data leak incident made him suspect Li Zhe, but he still thought Wang Bo was acting strangely. Even though they had distanced themselves from Li Zhe, he didn’t think it was Li Zhe and the Nan Gong Family colluding. But now it had been confirmed.

Chapter 622: Meeting

After questioning these workers, Zhang Yuan was certain they had no more secrets. He let the two men leave.

Moreover, he couldn’t do anything to these workers because they were still working under him. He couldn’t punish them for spreading this information in secret, so he could only let them go back and work hard without thinking too much.

After these two workers left, Zhang Yuan immediately sent someone to contact Wang Bo and asked him to come over secretly. He had something important to discuss with him.

At first, Wang Bo felt a bit uneasy when he heard Zhang Yuan wanted to meet with him secretly. He thought it was about the previous data leak incident. Although he had managed to shift the blame onto Li Zhe, Wang Bo still felt Zhang Yuan was suspecting him.

But Wang Bo couldn’t avoid it; the more he avoided, the more Zhang Yuan would suspect him. So when he received the message that someone had told him to meet Zhang Yuan, Wang Bo quickly got himself together and went toward Zhang Yuan.

When Wang Bo arrived at Zhang Yuan’s place with his men, he saw that Zhang Yuan and his subordinates were looking troubled. They weren’t showing any hostility to confront him, so Wang Bo relaxed a bit and realized that Zhang Yuan had another purpose. It wasn’t about the previous data leak incident.

“Old boss Zhang, I don’t know what you called me for. You look troubled; did something happen at the dock?” Wang Bo said while observing Zhang Yuan’s expression, trying to get more information.

“Sit down first. I’ll explain after you sit.” Zhang Yuan waved his hand at Wang Bo, indicating he should sit down.

Wang Bo immediately sat down and asked urgently: “Now you can finally tell me what it is? You’ve been teasing my appetite like this, and I’m getting anxious.”

“Do you know that people in the Inland Harbor have colluded with the Nan Gong Family?” Zhang Yuan didn’t say this to Wang Bo, but it was about Li Zhe. However, the words fell on Wang Bo’s ears as another meaning.

“Wasn’t it Li Zhe before? Is there someone else now?” Wang Bo asked, unsure but redirected the topic back to Li Zhe. After all, the previous data leak incident had been concluded as being related to Li Zhe, so he naturally directed it there.

At this moment, Zhang Yuan slammed the table and said angrily: “Yes, it was Li Zhe’s little brat! I thought he would reform after leaking the data to the Nan Gong Family, but now he’s openly colluded with them. It’s not even secret anymore! How could this be possible!”

Upon hearing Zhang Yuan speak, Wang Bo felt a heavy stone in his heart. He realized that Zhang Yuan had called him to denounce Li Zhe.

But Wang Bo immediately realized something was wrong. If it was about the previous data leak incident, he naturally knew the details. However, what Zhang Yuan meant by Li Zhe colluding with the Nan Gong Family openly was unclear.

Wang Bo felt uneasy. He had previously been collaborating with the Nan Gong Family, and although it was a one-time cooperation, he thought his relationship with them was closer than theirs. How could Li Zhe have gotten there first?

In fact, Wang Bo wanted to develop more with the Nan Gong Family. He knew that the Nan Gong Family had only controlled power in the Inland Harbor for a year, so he was hesitant. He wanted to maintain just one cooperation.

But he hadn’t expected that while he was hesitating whether to ally with the Nan Gong Family, Li Zhe had already taken the lead.

“Li Zhe’s forces are the smallest in the Inland Harbor, but it seems that those without shoes don’t fear being shod. If he truly colludes with the Nan Gong Family, then within this year he has a chance to expand his power. Even if it fails, it won’t be worse than now. This kid really took a desperate gamble.”

Wang Bo muttered this in his mind and also felt regret. He hadn’t expected that opportunity to be seized by Li Zhe. If he now went to ally with the Nan Gong Family, they might not be willing to cooperate with him.

They just needed me to have Li Zhe’s forces, regardless of their size. As long as they could get an opportunity to infiltrate the Inland Harbor, it would achieve the Nan Gong Family’s goal.

“I don’t quite understand what you mean by ‘colluding openly with the Nan Gong Family’?” Wang Bo smiled and asked, as he was truly confused about what Li Zhe and the Nan Gong Family had collaborated on.

“You don’t feel that your workers have been restless recently? They’ve been whispering about something in secret?” Zhang Yuan didn’t answer immediately but asked back.

Upon hearing this, Wang Bo felt something was wrong and said to his subordinates: “What’s going on? Didn’t you tell me anything unusual in the Inland Harbor these days?”

His subordinate looked troubled and said: “I thought it wasn’t important to tell you. It’s just that the workers are whispering in secret.”

“Tell me directly, what is it?” Wang Bo’s face darkened and he said this.

“It’s that the workers are whispering about Li Zhe recruiting people, giving them an extra few hundred yuan per month. And they get a fee for each person they bring over. These people are just whispering but haven’t gone yet, so I don’t think it’s serious. It wasn’t worth telling you.”

“Such a big issue isn’t serious? They’re already trying to steal your people! Are you waiting until they all leave before telling me? Or are you also planning to switch sides?”

Wang Bo was furious. He hadn’t expected this news to be hidden from him, and his subordinate even said it wasn’t important. This issue was clearly very important.

“No, I just thought Li Zhe’s kid wouldn’t make much of a splash. He was just making empty promises, giving them an extra few hundred yuan per month. Where would he get so much money?” Wang Bo’s subordinate had the same thoughts as Zhang Yuan initially, but he didn’t know that Li Zhe had the Nan Gong Family behind him.

“You didn’t hear? Li Zhe has colluded with the Nan Gong Family! Li Zhe doesn’t have money, but the Nan Gong Family does! This money is just a drop in the bucket for the Nan Gong Family. The entire Inland Harbor’s situation will be completely changed.” Wang Bo was very angry, but his rationality hadn’t been broken. His words were logical and well-founded.
