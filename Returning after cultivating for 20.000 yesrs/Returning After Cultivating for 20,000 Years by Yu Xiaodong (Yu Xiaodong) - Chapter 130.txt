At this moment, Su Nantian had left the hotel and was heading back to the Nan Gong family residence. He currently lived there, naturally under a set schedule; unless he was assigned a mission, he could not stay out past the designated time.

This was why Su Nantian had immediately gone straight to the point upon arriving—he would be suspected if he returned late.

However, when Su Nantian returned to the Nan Gong family and prepared to go back to his own residence, Nan Gong Ping's villa, he discovered a person standing under a tree on the path he had to take. The silhouette was incredibly familiar—was it not Nan Gong Yayan?

"Miss, why aren't you going back at this late hour? What are you doing standing here?" Su Nantian said with a grin.

"You think I'm standing here for what? Naturally, waiting for you. You came back so late—did you finish your meeting with Wu Chuan's assistant?" Nan Gong Yayan replied with a grin.

Many people might have thought Su Nantian had been caught red-handed this time, but in reality, it was not so. When Wu Chuan's assistant had contacted him, he had already called Nan Gong Yayan to inform her of the matter.

Normally, this plan concerning the wetland bidding should have been reported to Nan Gong Ping. However, Su Nantian had thought that if he told Nan Gong Ping, given his personality, it might reveal the truth. Then, attempting to turn the plan around would be difficult. Thus, he had to let Nan Gong Ping truly believe there was something fishy in the matter so that Su Nantian could continue playing his role as a double agent.

But since he had no direct way to contact Nan Gong Lin, Su Nantian decided to inform Nan Gong Yayan instead—this was also giving her an opportunity to get involved. After all, Nan Gong Lin had handed this plan over to Nan Gong Ping; in effect, he did not want Nan Gong Yayan to interfere. However, Nan Gong Yayan was very interested in this plan and had long struggled to find a way in. Thus, Su Nantian, out of respect for Nan Gong Yayan's knowledge of his secret, did her a favor.

"Have you informed the master?"

"Of course I have. But you know, he's old, and it's already late—so I came here first to check on the progress tonight."

Nan Gong Yayan said, shaking her phone. It was nearly midnight now; according to their usual schedule, Nan Gong Lin had already gone to bed. Thus, even if Su Nantian wanted to report the situation now, it would be impossible.

Moreover, this matter was Su Nantian's own initiative to inform Nan Gong Yayan. She had been waiting for him here to know the situation tonight, so it was perfectly reasonable.

Su Nantian couldn't help but pat his forehead and said, "There hasn't been much progress yet. But I can at least tell you the conditions Wu Chuan's assistant gave me."

Chapter 650: Autonomy

After hearing Su Nantian's account of the conditions Wu Chuan's assistant had offered him, Nan Gong Yayan said, "I never expected Wu Family to value you so much that they even thought of a fallback plan. Usually, people would only offer money, but they've invited you to join Wu Family. Why didn't you accept? Isn't this condition very tempting for you? If you had accepted, it would have perfectly aligned with your plan and allowed you to enter Wu Family. Then your next move could have been executed flawlessly."

Nan Gong Yayan did not clarify what the plan was, but both she and Su Nantian understood exactly what they meant. Naturally, it referred to the plan Su Nantian had attempted to rescue Wu You'er and Wu Tao's couple, which Nan Gong Yayan had discovered.

"Yes, this condition was indeed very tempting for me. Not to mention the money; it allowed me to enter Wu Family, so there would be no reason for Wu Chuan to suspect my true purpose. This provided great convenience for my next rescue mission. However, I had also thought through the matter—if I truly betrayed the Nan Gong Family to do this, it would only be leading myself down a dead end."

After saying this, Su Nantian stared intently at Nan Gong Yayan with an enigmatic expression and continued: "If I had done this, even if I managed to pull off a trick on the Nan Gong Family and smoothly entered Wu Family, you would have known my true purpose. Then your plan would be completely ruined, and at that time, you would be surrounded by danger."

After saying this, Nan Gong Yayan couldn't help but laugh heartily and said: "I had a moment of hope that you truly cared for the Nan Gong Family, but I never expected your reasoning to be because of fear. You were afraid that I would reveal your plan to Wu Family, and then your whole scheme would collapse. But if you continue maintaining your current relationship with the Nan Gong Family, this plan still has a chance of success. Compared to complete failure and this possibility of success, anyone would choose the latter."

"Although that is true, I must also say that in this matter, I naturally still side with the Nan Gong Family. I admit that from the very beginning, my purpose in entering the Nan Gong Family was to get into Wu Family and use the Nan Gong Family as a cover. However, during this time, I have indeed developed some feelings for our country and a sense of belonging."

After hearing Su Nantian say this, Nan Gong Yayan was momentarily stunned. He had not expected Su Nantian to say such words, and a sudden sense of trembling stirred within him.

Nan Gong Yayan had always been clear that he had an inexplicable feeling for Su Nantian, because he loved him.

But after learning of Su Nantian's identity, he had known that he could never be with him. After all, he had used the Nan Gong Family. Even if his heart could overcome this obstacle, Nan Gong Lin would never entrust himself to such a person. Moreover, he knew that Nan Gong Lin had always intended to use him as a tool for economic marriage.

Therefore, since then, Nan Gong Yayan had always restrained his feelings. But just now, when Su Nantian said that he seemed to have a little emotion for the Nan Gong Family, he had even felt there might be a slight possibility of being with Su Nantian.

But soon, Nan Gong Yayan regained his senses because at this moment, Su Nantian had no choice but to say what he wanted. Since his leverage was in her hands, he would have to follow her will to bring maximum benefit.

"Alright, stop being so smooth-tongued. Now that this situation has arisen, what are you planning to do next? Although Father has already known about this matter, I think his intention is for you and Nan Gong Ping to handle it together. He only wants to be your backup. And even if I know about this, I can't interfere too much."

After saying this, Nan Gong Yayan clenched his fists. He wanted to get involved in the matter but couldn't interfere too much. Moreover, he felt that if it were himself, he and Su Nantian could easily get through this crisis by working together. But if it were Nan Gong Ping, an incompetent fool, the situation might end up worse.

"I haven't figured out the specific plan yet. They've given me some time to think, after all, the most important thing right now is dealing with the bidding. If we don't win this bid, all subsequent matters are just empty talk. But I don't plan to tell the young master about this. The main thing is to play along with their plan, so I'm going to keep him in the dark."

"But this way of acting is too dangerous. If you don't tell your brother the truth, he might really think you're a traitor. Your consequences would not be good."

Nan Gong Yayan shook his head and said, believing that this matter should also be told to Nan Gong Ping. Keeping him in the dark might bring more uncertain factors.

"Only you and the master know the truth, so there must be someone who can prove my innocence. And I think that keeping the young master in the dark is better for playing this act; otherwise, it might reveal our hand."

Su Nantian's words were already quite subtle. He mainly felt that Nan Gong Ping couldn't keep secrets. If he told the whole plan to him, it might be discovered. Therefore, he decided to contact Wu Family alone and let Nan Gong Yayan and Nan Gong Lin know the truth, which could prove his innocence.

"But as for the specific plan, I haven't figured it out yet. Let's just go along with the plan for now. They've given me time to think, and eventually, even if I don't seek them out, they will come looking for me. Moreover, I also need to feign adding some stakes to make them think I'm truly considering this matter. If I act too quickly, it would only raise their suspicions."

Su Nantian had thought through this matter quite thoroughly. However, the specific details would have to be decided on the spot; thus, what he could foresee now was only the general steps. The details in between would have to be decided later.

"Then, if that's the case, you can proceed according to your own will. As for what is needed later, come find me and Father."

Nan Gong Yayan nodded, giving Su Nantian complete autonomy over this matter.

Chapter 651: Seizing the Opportunity

After Su Nantian had spoken with Nan Gong Yayan the previous night, he was called by Nan Gong Lin early the next morning. Naturally, Nan Gong Lin wanted to inquire about this matter since it concerned a major project for the Nan Gong Family. This wetland bidding plan was their biggest project this year, and it had come from above—therefore, it could not be failed.

When Su Nantian arrived at Nan Gong Lin's villa, he found him sitting at the dining table having breakfast, and there was already a set of chopsticks placed on the seat across from him.

"Master, I'm here," Su Nantian said respectfully upon arriving and stood by waiting for Nan Gong Lin's instructions.

"Sit down. Have breakfast while we talk," Nan Gong Lin looked up at Su Nantian and tapped the table with his hand, indicating that he should sit across from him.

Since Nan Gong Lin had spoken like this, Su Nantian immediately sat down and picked up his breakfast to eat. At least, this situation proved that Nan Gong Lin had some slight trust in him; otherwise, he wouldn't have arranged for Su Nantian to sit across from him during breakfast.

"How did your meeting with Wu Family go last night?" Nan Gong Lin asked after taking a few bites.

"Wu Chuan himself didn't come; he sent his assistant, the one who often accompanies him. He proposed some conditions to me, asking that after we win this wetland bidding case, he would have more profit from it."

Su Nantian had decided not to hide this matter and told Nan Gong Lin all the details.

"I knew Wu Family would try some tricks. This case could have been handled by us alone, but it was a bit rushed since we still had another case to complete. If that case were completed, there would be no need for Wu Family."

"But I never expected Wu Family to be so ungrateful. I only agreed to cooperate with them because Yayan had promised to prioritize Wu Family in future collaborations. But these people have schemed against me behind my back."

Nan Gong Lin said this while extremely angry, even throwing his knife and fork onto the table, looking very furious.

"Don't be so angry, Master. I never expected them to play such a foolish move. Why did they want to recruit me? Their plot is definitely not going to succeed. You can rest assured about this."

Su Nantian comforted him, as this matter was not really a problem for the Nan Gong Family. Moreover, they had already known what Wu Family had done.

Unexpectedly, after hearing this, Nan Gong Lin chuckled and said: "Wu Family has found the right person. They've chosen you to do this for them, so they must have figured out your capabilities."

After saying this, Nan Gong Lin looked at Su Nantian with a meaningful gaze. This made Su Nantian's heart twitch.

Because Su Nantian clearly understood that Nan Gong Lin was also investigating his true identity. However, the information he had given them was only this much; no matter how they investigated, they couldn't find anything else. Unless Su Nantian's disguise was discovered and his true identity found through this face, they would not be able to find any other information about him.

In this regard, Su Nantian was very confident. Regarding the confidentiality of information, both the Dragon Group and himself had reached the pinnacle. Unless Su Nantian deliberately wanted them to know his true identity, even if the Nan Gong Family used their resources to investigate, they would not be able to find any other information about him.

Su Nantian's inner confidence was clear, but on the surface, he still had to appear somewhat fearful and said with great trepidation: "Master... Master, what do you mean? I've only been in the Nan Gong Family for a short time, but I'm loyal to the family. Otherwise, this opportunity Wu Family offered me would have allowed me to betray you."

Su Nantian had taken a risky step, thinking that Nan Gong Lin was high-minded and would not do anything to him.

Nan Gong Lin raised an eyebrow and said with interest: "Then tell me, what conditions did Wu Family give you?"

Su Nantian nodded and extended three fingers: "Three million, and if this matter is completed, Wu Family would also offer me a position to work for them."

After hearing Su Nantian's words, Nan Gong Lin couldn't help but laugh heartily and clapped his hands: "Wu Chuan has really invested a lot this time. Not to mention the three million, but the last condition alone is rare. I think Wu Chuan saw your ability and wanted to lure you away from us, so he offered this additional condition. But he was too naive; trying to steal people from our Nan Gong Family is too much of an underestimate."

After saying this, Nan Gong Lin's facial expression suddenly turned very gloomy and said: "I won't hide it from you. I've had doubts about your identity all along and have sent people to investigate multiple times, but I can only regretfully declare that I found nothing suspicious in your records. It's just that this kid gives me an unsafe feeling, so I've given you many tests before."

After hearing this, Su Nantian's heart gave a jolt. It seemed his previous considerations were not unfounded; Nan Gong Lin was indeed investigating him secretly.

But his information measures were extremely well-protected, almost impregnable. No matter how they investigated, they couldn't find his true identity or information.

"I know. I'm just a small bodyguard in the Nan Gong Family, but both you and the young master have given me many important tasks. Some of these matters were even a trial for me. I've always wondered if you had suspicions about my identity, but since I couldn't say it directly, the master finally brought up this issue today. Let's talk openly now."

After hearing Nan Gong Lin's words, Su Nantian didn't shrink back. If it were anyone else, they would have just evaded the topic.

But Su Nantian saw this as a good opportunity.

Chapter 652: Retention

After hearing Su Nantian's words, Nan Gong Lin was momentarily stunned. He had never expected Su Nantian to propose an open conversation.

In fact, Nan Gong Lin hadn't intended to pursue Su Nantian this time. He had not found any flaws in Su Nantian's actions yet, and his words were just to test him. If it had been anyone else, they would have been trembling now and would have surely felt a storm of emotions internally.

But Su Nantian had taken the initiative to talk with him, which made Nan Gong Lin find it interesting.

"What do you want to talk about with me?" Nan Gong Lin smiled and spoke softly.

"Master has never trusted me, I want to know why. You've said that you checked my background and identity thoroughly and they were all ordinary. What makes you distrust me?"

Su Nantian directly confronted him without any detours.

After hearing this, Nan Gong Lin couldn't help but laugh heartily and then tapped his walking stick: "You really are very interesting, quite amusing. I never expected you to bring up this issue in front of me. If it were anyone else, they would have surely avoided the topic and taken a sigh of relief. It seems your confidence is really solid."

"Because I have no guilt, and I don't want you to misunderstand me anymore. So Master, tell me what your thoughts are."

Su Nantian continued, his face still showing no fear.

After hearing this, Nan Gong Lin nodded and said: "Alright, since you have the courage to ask me this question, I'll tell you. Yes, I've checked your background and records several times before, and they were clean—completely without flaws. What you said earlier also matched up, and there were no stains or anything that could harm the Nan Gong Family.

Perhaps it's just my excessive suspicion, but I feel this clean background is too suspicious. Countless people have tried to break into my Nan Gong Family, so that's why the Tian Shui Building exists. But since the Tian Shui Building was established, very few people have entered my Nan Gong Family through that channel.

Even if they did enter the Nan Gong Family, everyone inevitably had their own strengths. However, these people's hands were always unclean; they all came with their own goals and posed a great threat to the Nan Gong Family."

After hearing this, Su Nantian understood. In general, families like theirs would pass on positions within the family, and some people who performed well in the company could be promoted. However, they would never touch the core of the Nan Gong Family itself.

But now, he had entered the internal circle of the Nan Gong Family. Based on past experiences, people who entered through the Tian Shui Building always had their own goals.

However, Su Nantian was no exception. He also had his own goals, but this time it was different. Others sought the Nan Gong Family's resources, while he simply used the Nan Gong Family's identity as a cover.

That was why Su Nantian was different from others, and that was also why the Nan Gong Family could never find any flaws in him.

"What I said earlier is correct. The Tian Shui Building is a symbol for the Nan Gong Family. It proves that over the past century, the Nan Gong Family's power among the major families. Although it no longer has any affiliations now, the Tian Shui Building standing in the capital represents that the Nan Gong Family hasn't fallen. However, why do you still continue to use this channel for selecting people into the Nan Gong Family? You should already know the answer, right?"

Nan Gong Lin didn't finish his sentence but instead asked Su Nantian. He felt that after saying this, Su Nantian should already understand the reason.

After hearing this, Su Nantian nodded. With Nan Gong Lin's words, he had indeed understood the matter.

"I see. Continuing to use the Tian Shui Building for selecting talent is a deterrent for the Nan Gong Family. It's telling other families that even if they want to send people into the Nan Gong Family to do something, the Nan Gong Family is fearless.

Moreover, previous cases have shown that if people enter the Nan Gong Family and do anything threatening to it, they will be immediately eliminated. Am I right?"

Su Nantian finally understood. For Nan Gong Ping, the Tian Shui Building was a symbol. In a place like the capital where land is precious, keeping the Tian Shui Building standing among skyscrapers was undoubtedly a display of the Nan Gong Family's power.

However, continuing to use this method for selecting talent was a deterrent left behind. If one day the Nan Gong Family truly became timid and cut off this talent selection path, it would undoubtedly be announcing a crisis to the other major families. At that moment, they wouldn't be able to distinguish who was sent in.

Nan Gong Lin nodded in agreement after hearing Su Nantian's words and smiled, clapping his hands: "I knew you were smart enough to understand what I meant. Yes, this is why the Tian Shui Building still remains in use today. Actually, whether or not they select talent doesn't matter to the Nan Gong Family; we just want to use this method to maintain the family's dignity.

It's just that I never expected this selection process would have selected you. Moreover, your abilities are truly remarkable, and your identity is particularly clean."

Chapter 653: Deep Conversation

After Su Nantian and Nan Gong Lin had gone around in circles, they ended up discussing Su Nantian's identity again.

And as Su Nantian looked into Nan Gong Lin's eyes, he felt like he had been completely penetrated. It was undeniable that this was the gaze of a family with long years of experience, having weathered countless struggles and being able to see through people's surface.

Therefore, Su Nantian felt a chill running through his body under Nan Gong Lin's gaze. This was indeed a new experience for Su Nantian, as he hadn't felt this way in years. Instead, under Nan Gong Lin's gaze, he felt a long-forgotten sensation.

"So because of this reason, from the very beginning Master has believed my identity was not clean and that I entered the Nan Gong Family with ulterior motives. That's why you set me many difficult challenges afterward."

Su Nantian spoke calmly and continued the topic.

"You could say that, but you have indeed solved many problems for the Nan Gong Family. However, despite this, I still hold my initial view—that your identity is definitely problematic.

But I don't know why your methods are so high-level that I can't find any flaws. The more this is the case, the more it makes me feel dangerous.

Because others, no matter how they disguise themselves, with the Nan Gong Family's strength, we can find out. But your disguise is impossible to uncover. Isn't this more frightening?"

Nan Gong Lin now fully expressed his attitude. He had always believed that Su Nantian was problematic, and even now he still felt that Su Nantian's identity was wrong.

"So Master still doesn't trust me, but you've entrusted this matter to me. Do you think it's appropriate? Don't you fear that I might really collude with Wu Family and harm the Nan Gong Family?

This wetland bidding plan requires a considerable investment of funds, and if it's successful, the profits would be significant. If I were to sabotage it and give all the gains to Wu Family, it would also be a big blow for the Nan Gong Family. So Master, you don't trust me but still let me do this for the Nan Gong Family—doesn't that seem contradictory?"

Su Nantian had the courage to say this because he knew Nan Gong Lin wouldn't reprimand him for it, and he himself had no intention of helping Wu Family.

"I haven't figured out your identity yet, but I do know that in this matter you won't help Wu Family. I have confidence in controlling you, and that's my source of confidence. Since you've insisted on having this open conversation today, I'll also tell you my position. Although I don't know what your family is doing, I can now determine that your threat to the Nan Gong Family isn't great. So even if there are other stories behind your identity, you can't escape my grasp now."

After saying this, Nan Gong Lin started coughing violently. His whole body was convulsed with coughs, and his face turned red. It was clear that this wasn't an accident but a result of a long-standing illness.

The Nan Gong Family's housekeeper, upon seeing this, immediately ran over and took out a bottle of medicine for Nan Gong Lin to take. This temporarily eased his cough, which had been quite intense.

"I didn't expect you to see this," Nan Gong Lin said after coughing, patting his chest.

"Master's illness is something I noticed before. I just thought it wasn't my business, so I didn't say anything. But apparently neither the young master nor the young lady have noticed it. So are you still planning to keep this a secret from them?"

Su Nantian said, looking at Nan Gong Lin who had just recovered his composure. In fact, he had already noticed that Nan Gong Lin's health was not good and that it might not last long. However, Su Nantian had thought this matter was unrelated to him and hadn't probed into it. Moreover, he felt that Nan Gong Lin was keeping this secret from both Nan Gong Ping and Nan Gong Yayan, so he didn't want to expose it. This might disrupt Nan Gong Lin's own plans.

"I said you're too shrewd. I have two children, Nan Gong Ping and Nan Gong Yayan. Neither of them is as good as you. You've been by their sides, so I suppose you know them well. Tell me, if I were the master, who would you choose as the next family head?"

Su Nantian had not expected Nan Gong Lin to ask him such a question. He didn't know what purpose Nan Gong Lin had in asking it.

"If the master really wants to hear my answer, I'll say. If I were the master, I would unhesitatingly choose Miss Yayan as the next family head. But from your current condition, it seems you favor Nan Gong Ping more."

"Unexpectedly, you chose Yayan. You've been with Ping longer but chose Yayan. Did he promise you something?"

Actually, Nan Gong Lin had already noticed that there was a different feeling between Yayan and Su Nantian. However, he didn't want to think in that direction now. Moreover, he felt Su Nantian didn't seem to have such intentions.

"I'm speaking from the master's perspective, not my own. If I were the master, I would definitely choose Miss Yayan because she is more proactive and intelligent than Ping. She's more suitable for this position. If Ping were an ordinary person, he would already be very outstanding. But if he's to become the head of the Nan Gong Family, his qualifications are still lacking."

Su Nantian had already spoken so much with Nan Gong Lin. At this moment, he decided not to hide anything and directly expressed his evaluation of Nan Gong Ping.

"Indeed, everyone can see who is better between Ping and Yayan. But I've been hesitating all along, unable to decide who should inherit the family head position.

Perhaps everyone thinks I'm biased towards Ping. But they don't know how important the inheritance of this family position is. I have to consider many issues, not just who has the talent to decide who should inherit this position.

I certainly admit that Yayan is much more capable than Ping in terms of ability. Her abilities make her a better leader. However, there are too many complex matters."

Nan Gong Lin sighed helplessly and said.

Chapter 654: Tiger

As Su Nantian looked at Nan Gong Lin's expression of sighing, he felt that the old man had become much older. At first, Su Nantian's impression of Nan Gong Lin was that he was the head of the Nan Gong Family, sharp and skilled in his ways.

But now, seeing him like this, along with the white hair on his head, Su Nantian couldn't help but realize that he was just a weak old man. And clearly, Nan Gong Lin's current health condition had become irreversible; otherwise, the strength of the Nan Gong Family would never have allowed his body to reach this state.

Therefore, stabilizing the situation of the Nan Gong Family and selecting the next heir were now the most important things for Nan Gong Lin. To test Nan Gong Yayan and Nan Gong Ping, he had assigned them different tasks.

Su Nantian suddenly realized that the two tasks Nan Gong Lin had given to Nan Gong Yayan and Nan Gong Ping were both directional. For example, Nan Gong Yayan, who was skilled in social interactions and had mastered various matters, was more capable than Nan Gong Ping. Therefore, this time he had been assigned to a place called the Inland Port.

However, for Nan Gong Ping, it was specifically chosen that he should deal with Wu Chuan. Not to mention that Wu Chuan's seniority was higher than Nan Gong Ping, and Wu Chuan had accumulated a lot of experience in the business world over the years—something Nan Gong Ping could never match.

Moreover, completing this task was very complex; it wasn't just about cooperating with Wu Chuan but also about opposing and differentiating from him. This was a huge challenge for Nan Gong Ping. If he could handle this matter, it would be a great growth opportunity for him.

After thinking about this issue, Su Nantian couldn't help but feel that Nan Gong Lin was truly a remarkable person. He had considered everything thoroughly, yet now he had become a stumbling block because of the issue of who should inherit the Nan Gong Family.

This also couldn't help but say that no matter how powerful a person is, they have their own weaknesses. For Nan Gong Lin, these two children were his soft spot. And even now he was still indecisive, which made a person who had dominated the business world and commanded absolute authority hesitate over such matters. It was quite ironic.

"You've seen the current situation of the Nan Gong Family, which has almost no one to rely on. And now it's only me, so they dare not act. But if I were to fall down because of this body one day, those people would definitely show their fangs."

Nan Gong Lin said while shaking his head helplessly. The matter of his body was something he couldn't control. He could plan and strategize in the business world, make many plans, but human bodies were something he couldn't control.

With their family's strength and money, they had found many famous doctors for Nan Gong Lin and taken him abroad for secret consultations. However, the results were not much use.

The doctors could only delay his pain but couldn't cure it. And over time, his body would become weaker and weaker. The doctors said he could only survive for another two years at most. After that, he would be paralyzed in bed and eventually die.

Therefore, these two years were crucial for Nan Gong Lin. He had to train his two children while also stabilizing the balance of the Nan Gong Family and absolutely not letting anyone know he was already very weak.

He had to protect his body well until the heir was decided and the situation of the Nan Gong Family was stabilized.

"Master, telling me all these things must be very dangerous. Don't you fear that I would leak this information? Then those people would rush in. Not only other major families, but also the Nan Gong Family itself—those wolves and tigers."

After hearing Su Nantian's words, Nan Gong Lin couldn't help but laugh and said: "I must say your mind is really sharp. If I could have a child like you, I wouldn't have to worry so much now. I never expected that you've already understood the internal matters of the Nan Gong Family. Those people seem harmless on the surface, but they are more ruthless in their backstabbing."

"Because I've worked with Nan Gong Fei, the young master. On the surface, he seems like a useless young man who can't do anything, but in reality, he has been slowly gathering information. He's also been constantly training and using his mind at the Inland Port.

It seems now that the Nan Gong Family is facing internal and external threats. Not only are there long-term factors from other families, but people inside have already started to stir. They just aren't sure about your current condition and think you've been withdrawing recently, so they've started to become active.

After all, you've been staying in the Nan Gong Family for a while and haven't gone out. This is a signal to others, making them feel that the tiger is sleeping."

Su Nantian had already uncovered Nan Gong Fei's face, knowing he was pretending to be a useless young man but was actually very sharp in the back.

At first, Su Nantian had noticed something strange from his eyes. Later, by intentionally paying attention, he found that it was indeed as he had suspected.

"So what do you think I should do?" Nan Gong Lin asked again.

"First, deal with the internal matters. We need to make the Nan Gong Family quiet temporarily, even if this silence isn't permanent. However, a temporary deterrent is necessary. This time, the cooperation with Wu Family is a good opportunity. Although now it's the young master who will handle these matters, the final move must be made by the master. This way, it would be a good proof for both the internal and external of the Nan Gong Family, telling them that the tiger hasn't fallen asleep."
