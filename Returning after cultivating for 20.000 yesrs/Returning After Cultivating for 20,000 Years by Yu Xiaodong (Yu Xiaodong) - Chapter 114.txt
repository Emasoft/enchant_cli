“Is this—what’s going on? Do they expect us to complete these files? These are all Wu Family tasks! I can’t let this slide—I must go ask them!” Nan Gong Fei’s face reddened with fury as he rushed out clutching the folder, while Su Nantian feared Nan Gong Fei might provoke these three men and followed him out.

“Three of you, what’s the meaning of those folders piled on my desk?” Nan Gong Fei confronted them directly.

“Folders? What folders?” The three men feigned ignorance, exchanging glances before replying.

“You see—those reports. These should have been done by the Wu Family! Why are they piled on my desk instead? Do you expect me to clean up after them?” Nan Gong Fei grew increasingly agitated, slamming the folder onto the table.

Yet Su Nantian immediately noticed one man’s fist clenching tightly, his face etched with impatience. He was ready to intercept Nan Gong Fei’s strike, but at that moment, someone beside him pressed down his hand.

The man chuckled and said, “My apologies. We don’t know what you’re talking about. Frankly speaking, we are merely the foremen of these inland port workers—our role is to move goods. As for these reports, it’s not our responsibility. You should have coordinated with the proper contacts.”

After this statement, Su Nantian realized they were lying. He had met this man during the coordination process and knew their role was pivotal in the ceremony. Thus, these reports should have been under their control.

Though Su Nantian still couldn’t distinguish which of the three was Wang Bo, Li Zhe, or Zhang Yuan, he knew they were deliberately leaving these reports to harass them.

“Then do the Wu Family not make reports? If they don’t, I won’t do it either. I’ll just throw them away—don’t blame me if the Wu Family later complains.” Nan Gong Fei stormed off, intending to toss the reports into the trash.

But before he could retreat, one of them chuckled and said, “Fine, you don’t have to do it. However, the inland port’s coordination still requires these reports. If they’re incomplete, payments might be withheld. You’ll have to decide for yourselves. We just move goods; we only care about our wages.”

After saying this, the man leisurely stood up and waved to his companions. The three men then left the office.

After they departed, Nan Gong Fei stamped his foot in frustration and muttered, “This person is clearly provoking us. I wonder what the Wu Family thinks they’re doing—daring to offend the Nan Gong clan? They already offended Nan Gong Yuyan once; now they haven’t learned their lesson yet?”

“Those were the Wu Family’s affairs, but this time it’s these three men. It might not involve the Wu Family directly. They must be responsible for filling out these reports, as they manage all the workers. The daily import and export figures of this inland port are under their control, so these reports not being done must be deliberate.”

At that moment, Su Nantian said this.

Chapter 565: Conflict

Su Nantian’s words only further enraged Nan Gong Fei, who asked, “Then what should we do now? Can’t we just finish these files for them? Besides, they handled the previous orders. Even if we wanted to do it, we wouldn’t know how. And without these reports, our subsequent acceptance will be difficult—just as they said, we might not get the final payment.”

Nan Gong Fei’s mind exploded with confusion. He felt his thoughts unraveling, unable to decide what to do next.

“You’re right,” Su Nantian nodded. “These papers are unusually new. I didn’t notice before, but your suspicion is correct—they’re deliberately giving us blank reports to harass us. However, they must have the actual completed reports in their possession.”

“Then this is manageable,” Nan Gong Fei said, rubbing his chin as if deep in thought. “But if they’re truly innocent, that would be a disaster. We must find a way to retrieve the reports from them.”

After a while, Su Nantian asked, “Do you have any ideas?”

“I haven’t thought of anything yet. I’ll just go ask them directly and confront them—they’ll surely be flustered, giving us an opportunity to shake their confidence.” Nan Gong Fei rushed out like a gust of wind, and Su Nantian barely had time to stop him before chasing after.

But Su Nantian was too late. When he arrived, he saw a crowd gathered at the dock and heard arguments.

“You’re clearly trying to trick us! Hurry up and produce the completed reports!” Su Nantian overheard Nan Gong Fei’s voice.

“Who do you think you are? I’ve told you several times—I don’t have this kind of thing. The reports are on your desk; if you can’t do them, why bother us?”

Su Nantian peeked inside and recognized one of the three men.

They had clearly returned to their respective posts, so Nan Gong Fei had only found one of them. The other two were likely at their own stations.

“You’re lying! These reports are as new as if they were just printed. Clearly, you’ve only recently printed them. The reports must still be in your possession, and the data is already completed. I don’t believe the Wu Family would entrust such a large inland port to you to run wild!”

Nan Gong Fei was impulsive, prone to violence. He was a spoiled aristocrat who often got into fights after drinking. Now, his temper flared, and he grabbed the man’s collar.

Su Nantian saw this and inwardly groaned. This would complicate matters, especially since the three were local power brokers with subordinates nearby who wouldn’t let their boss be threatened.

“Wang Ge, this kid is really pushing his luck. Let us teach him a lesson!” One of the subordinates shouted, and Su Nantian immediately realized this man must be Wang Bo. He had suspected the three were Wang Bo, Zhang Yuan, and Li Zhe since the beginning but couldn’t tell them apart. Now, with this subordinate calling him “Wang Ge,” it confirmed his identity.

But Wang Bo merely waved his hand, signaling the others not to act rashly.

“Kid,” he said calmly, “let go of my collar now, or I won’t be responsible for the consequences. Look at these brothers—they’re all ready to fight. If they want to attack you, I can’t stop them. You don’t listen when we talk nicely and instead resort to violence. I’ve told you the reports aren’t here; they’re yours. If you can’t fill them, find your own way.”

Wang Bo remained composed and didn’t intend to strike Nan Gong Fei immediately, knowing that if he struck first, he would be at fault.

If Nan Gong Fei had acted first, they wouldn’t have the upper hand. Su Nantian quickly pushed through the crowd and pulled Nan Gong Fei away.

“What are you doing? Speak politely! Why are you grabbing his collar?” Su Nantian glared at Nan Gong Fei and said.

“You’re scolding me now? What right do you have to scold me? You’re just a minor bodyguard of the Nan Gong clan. Even here, I’m your superior. You don’t support me but side with outsiders—this is turning your back on us! I’ll report this to Uncle tonight and tell him you’re a traitor!”

Nan Gong Fei was in a rage, seeing Su Nantian intervene. He felt betrayed and didn’t consider the consequences but thought Su Nantian was now turning against him. He would report this to Nan Gong Lin.

Nan Gong Lin had previously ordered Nan Gong Fei to monitor Su Nantian while working at the inland port, suspecting his intentions. Thus, Nan Gong Fei subconsciously believed Su Nantian was up to something and now took this emotion into the current situation, thinking Su Nantian had betrayed them.

Upon hearing Nan Gong Fei’s words, Su Nantian understood. Nan Gong Lin had sent him to monitor him.

But now, Su Nantian’s focus wasn’t on this. He needed to calm Nan Gong Fei down immediately and avoid any confrontation with Wang Bo.

“You’ll be at a disadvantage if you strike first. Why did you attack him when he was just speaking to you?” Su Nantian said, then turned to Wang Bo and said, “He’s just hot-tempered. I apologize on his behalf.”

Chapter 566: Not a Coward

If Su Nantian were Nan Gong Fei, he might have reacted the same way to Wang Bo. But now his reason told him it wasn’t the time to strike Wang Bo.

If either Su Nantian or Nan Gong Fei had struck any of the three—Wang Bo, Zhang Yuan, or Li Zhe—it would only strengthen their unity. This would make it extremely difficult to break up their temporary alliance.

Thus, they must now treat them kindly and flatter them, making them feel no threat. Only then would they begin to fracture and return to their previous power dynamics.

Before this, neither Su Nantian nor Nan Gong Fei could strike any of them. Their task now was to accelerate this transformation and catalyze their return to the original opposing state.

So Su Nantian now bowed his head and apologized to Wang Bo.

Nan Gong Fei, seeing Su Nantian had gone this far, wasn’t entirely ignorant of social graces. He knew Su Nantian’s actions were necessary, so he stopped his reckless behavior and turned back toward the office. He wouldn’t apologize to Wang Bo, but leaving now was a sign he would no longer act recklessly.

“You really know how to handle people, kid. If your少爷 could be as polite as you, we wouldn’t have had that scene earlier. I say this report issue should be resolved by yourselves. How could we possibly have reports? Look at me, I’m just a laborer here; how could I have such things? Right?” Wang Bo said, smiling and patting Su Nantian’s shoulder with a serious tone.

Su Nantian smiled back and said, “This doesn’t trouble you. I’ll apologize for our少爷. We’ll handle it ourselves; you carry on. I’m leaving now.”

Su Nantian’s face was full of smiles as he walked toward where Nan Gong Fei had gone. He needed to inform Nan Gong Fei of the plan immediately, otherwise, with his temper, he would provoke Wang Bo and the other two. This would make it impossible for him to proceed with his plan, as he wouldn’t have time to execute it and would instead be cleaning up Nan Gong Fei’s mess.

After returning to the office, Su Nantian found Nan Gong Fei had retreated into his inner office. He knocked on the door and entered, locking it behind him.

“What are you doing here? Don’t you have people to apologize to outside? What use is it coming back to me? You really don’t have any backbone,” Nan Gong Fei said without even looking up, as if Su Nantian were a dog that only bowed to others.

“You were too hasty. Without my help, we couldn’t have handled this today,” Su Nantian replied without giving Nan Gong Fei a good face. Though Nan Gong Fei was the少爷 of the Nan Gong clan, he knew this man had no status within it. Even if he reported to Nan Gong Lin, the latter wouldn’t punish him.

“You little bastard, don’t get too full of yourself. Do you know your place in the Nan Gong clan? And here, you’re still my subordinate. You dare to talk to me like that. I can’t beat Wang Bo now, but I can beat you!”

Nan Gong Fei was clearly angered by Su Nantian’s words. He slammed the table and stood up, walking toward Su Nantian.

Su Nantian smiled—it was exactly the effect he wanted. He knew Nan Gong Fei was burning with anger and wanted to vent it, but Su Nantian wouldn’t be a punching bag for him. This move was to show Nan Gong Fei that everything he did was for the next step, not out of fear.

Nan Gong Fei grabbed his collar just like he had done with Wang Bo and swung a punch toward Su Nantian’s face.

Just as he thought his fist would collide with Su Nantian’s face, Su Nantian swiftly grabbed Nan Gong Fei’s arm and twisted it.

Nan Gong Fei’s punch didn’t land on Su Nantian’s face. Instead, he clearly heard the sound of his bones shifting and felt a sharp pain in his arm.

“Gah!” Nan Gong Fei cried out, collapsing to the ground and clutching his arm.

At this moment, Nan Gong Fei’s forehead was drenched in sweat, and his face turned pale.

“You… you little bastard… You’re really risking your life! I… I’ll report this to Uncle tonight! You won’t be able to stay in the Nan Gong clan anymore!”

Nan Gong Fei now realized he couldn’t beat Su Nantian. Combined with the intense pain, he could only struggle on the ground but still spoke harshly.

Su Nantian smiled and crouched down, patting his face. “Now do you understand?”

“Understand what… Don’t talk nonsense to me!” Nan Gong Fei still didn’t get it, thinking Su Nantian was just showing off and humiliating him.

“You think my actions were to prevent you from fighting Wang Bo, but if you can’t even beat me, how could you fight Wang Bo? He has so many subordinates. If you really fought him, would you be able to walk back unscathed? Moreover, I told you that even if Wang Bo and his subordinates ganged up on me, I could have beaten them all to the ground and had them carried away in ambulances. But I didn’t do it. Don’t you understand now?”

Su Nantian said this to make Nan Gong Fei realize he had the strength to defeat Wang Bo, but he chose not to for the report issue. He could have beaten all three local bosses at the dock, but that would only mean defeating them without solving the report issue.

Chapter 567: Stratagem of Division

After this punch, Nan Gong Fei finally understood.

But he whined while clutching his arm, “You didn’t have to use such a drastic method. My arm is already like this now. Hurry up and get me an ambulance.”

“Honestly, it’s your own temper that caused this. I only said a few words and you came at me. It was the same as when you went after Wang Bo. Besides, this small injury doesn’t need a doctor. I can heal it for you.”

After saying that, Su Nantian reached out to take Nan Gong Fei’s arm. But Nan Gong Fei quickly protected it with his other hand and said carefully, “What are you going to do? You’re good at hitting people, but how will you heal me? My arm is already broken because of you.”

Nan Gong Fei still didn’t believe Su Nantian could heal his arm, so he was cautious and guarded.

Su Nantian could only shake his head in无奈. “Don’t you know how to do it yourself? You’ll be fine in a few seconds.”

Hearing this, Nan Gong Fei carefully examined Su Nantian’s face and noticed his expression was extremely serious, not like he was lying. He slightly lowered his guard.

At this moment, Su Nantian took Nan Gong Fei’s injured arm and snapped it sharply. There was a “crack” sound.

With that, Nan Gong Fei cried out again and shouted, “Su Nantian, you’re playing with me! I’ll kill…” But before he could finish his sentence, Nan Gong Fei felt his arm move again. He opened his eyes curiously and tried to move it, finding it flexible as before. There was no problem except for some slight pain.

“This… is already healed?” Nan Gong Fei still doubted and asked suspiciously.

“Didn’t you just try it? Your arm is already back to normal. What else do you call this?” Su Nantian replied impatiently.

“I didn’t expect you to actually have skills. But this is your responsibility since it was your fault. You should heal it for me.”

Nan Gong Fei moved his arm again, finding it normal in all directions. He felt relieved.

After confirming his arm was healed, Nan Gong Fei changed his expression and said, “Right, what should we do now? Since we can’t fight them directly, tell me what to do.”

Nan Gong Fei felt completely at a loss. At first, he thought if he could knock Wang Bo down, maybe he could get the reports from him. But after hearing Su Nantian’s words, he realized his approach was too naive and reckless, ultimately achieving nothing.

So Nan Gong Fei had no idea what to do next. He could only ask Su Nantian for guidance.

“My point is that these three—Wang Bo, Zhang Yuan, and Li Zhe—are only temporarily allied. If they were truly close, they wouldn’t have split into three factions at this inland port.

They only feel threatened because they know the year is ending and the inland port will be handed over to our Nan Gong clan. Previously, the Wu Family ignored them, but the Nan Gong clan’s arrival might not continue this status quo.

Moreover, now that you and I have been sent here, it means the Nan Gong clan wants to fully control all matters of this inland port within a year. That’s why they feel threatened and must unite to fight us.”

After Su Nantian’s analysis, Nan Gong Fei nodded, thinking it was reasonable. But this still didn’t clarify what to do next.

“What should we do then? Your analysis is useless. Can you just come up with a plan?”

Hearing Nan Gong Fei’s words, Su Nantian realized this person was truly a fool. He had previously thought Nan Gong Ping was too ordinary to inherit the Nan Gong clan, but now it seemed Nan Gong Fei was even worse than Nan Gong Ping.

If he were Nan Gong Lin, seeing his brother had such a son would make him laugh out loud. This basically meant no one could challenge the Nan Gong clan’s leadership, and there was no need to worry about power struggles.

“My point is we can use a stratagem of division. If you had attacked Wang Bo, they would have become even more united because you could attack the other two as well. They would grow closer and see us as a common enemy. Only by separating them and returning to their usual dock state can we find an opportunity.”

Su Nantian could only speak clearly, avoiding complex words that this person might not understand.

Nan Gong Fei’s eyes lit up upon hearing Su Nantian’s plan, as if he had heard a brilliant idea for the first time. It seemed he hadn’t thought of this before.

“That’s a great plan! But how do we separate them?” Nan Gong Fei asked again.

Su Nantian rubbed his chin and said, “At this moment, you少爷 are crucial. Only you can help me implement this plan.”

Hearing Su Nantian elevate him, Nan Gong Fei immediately felt different. He stood tall and proud.

“Tell me, since I’m so important, what should I do for you?” Nan Gong Fei puffed out his chest and said.

“You need to spend some money. We must first find an informant, someone who understands the dock’s affairs. We need to gather information from him before we can plan next steps.”

Although Su Nantian had obtained some information about the inland port from Yuan Daying, it was only general details. For specific matters, they needed to find someone within the dock.

Chapter 568: Gossipmonger

In fact, Su Nantian was clearly using Nan Gong Fei. At this moment, a naive person like Nan Gong Fei only had the value of spending money. To have him do something else would likely result in failure.

Although Nan Gong Fei had no official position within the Nan Gong clan, he was still a member. And it was said his father spoiled him greatly, so he wouldn’t lack money.

Nan Gong Fei had just been praised by Su Nantian, so when he heard this request, he immediately agreed and confidently puffed out his chest. “Don’t worry, it’s just money. I have as much as you need.”

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian secretly smiled and continued to flatter him. “No wonder you’re the少爷, so rich and powerful. This is a crucial step for us. Only if this succeeds can we proceed with the mission. The少爷 will definitely be a hero, and even your father won’t dare to criticize you anymore. He’ll surely look at you differently.”

Su Nantian continued to flatter Nan Gong Fei, making him seem like a hero.

“Tell me, how much money do you need? I’ll transfer it to you right away.” Nan Gong Fei, hearing this, was delighted. He had never been praised like this before. And thinking about how his father would look at him differently after completing this task, he was full of anticipation.

Su Nantian thought for a moment and raised one finger.

Nan Gong Fei immediately said, “Just ten thousand? I’ll transfer it right now! What a small matter!”

After saying this, Nan Gong Fei immediately took out his phone and asked for Su Nantian’s account. Soon, ten thousand yuan entered Su Nantian’s account.

Su Nantian was genuinely surprised. He had meant to ask for one thousand yuan, but this Nan Gong Fei had transferred ten thousand instead.

However, since the money was already transferred, Su Nantian didn’t reveal the truth. Moreover, one thousand yuan might not have achieved his goal, so having ten thousand was better.

“Okay,少爷, I’ve received it. Just wait for my good news. You just stay put and I’ll definitely complete this task for you.” Su Nantian said, then left excitedly. He now needed to proceed with his plan.

He had already clashed with Wang Bo, so going back there now would be unwise. And Wang Bo’s people would definitely have a negative reaction toward him, so Su Nantian didn’t go to Wang Bo’s area. Instead, he chose Li Zhe’s group.

Su Nantian looked around and noticed no one in Li Zhe’s area recognized him. He didn’t know where Li Zhe was, so he approached a worker and asked, “Sir, could I ask you something?”

“What do you want to know? There’s nothing to find out. Don’t bother me; I can’t afford to be delayed, or I’ll lose money.”

This worker clearly had been instructed before. If anyone asked him questions, he wouldn’t answer.

Su Nantian immediately took out two hundred-yuan bills from his pocket and handed them to him. “Sir, just a few seconds of your time. Please be kind.”

These two hundred-yuan bills were more than this worker could earn in a day. He thought, “I’m just an ordinary worker; even if he asks me something, I can’t leak any secrets.” He quickly looked around and saw no one paying attention. They were all moving goods and doing their jobs.

The worker nodded and said, “Ask quickly, but if I don’t know the answer, I won’t tell you. But I won’t return these bills.” After saying this, he put the hundred-yuan bill into his pants pocket.

“I just want to know who in this dock is the most knowledgeable—like a gossipmonger, someone who knows all the rumors.” Su Nantian wouldn’t be foolish enough to ask just anyone about the conflicts between these groups. Ordinary workers didn’t know much about this.

These three factions had a power struggle, and most ordinary workers only knew which side they were assigned to. They didn’t know the fundamental reasons for their conflict.

To find out more, Su Nantian needed to find a gossipmonger. Only such people would know how this situation started.

Moreover, these types of people always wanted to use their information for trade. With money, they could be persuaded.

“You’ve asked the right person. There is indeed a gossipmonger named Liang Bo in this dock. However, he’s not one of us; he’s under Zhang Yuan’s group and is even a team leader. It might be difficult to reach him. Alright, I don’t have time to talk anymore. You find him yourself; it’s none of my business.”

After saying this, the worker immediately picked up his goods and hurriedly went back to work.

Su Nantian saw him leave but didn’t directly go to Zhang Yuan’s area to find this Liang Bo. He knew that going there openly would put him in a difficult position.

Moreover, he might never get any information from Liang Bo after that. So to find this Liang Bo, Su Nantian needed to wait until the workers finished their shifts.

After thinking this through, Su Nantian went back into the office. If he remembered correctly, there were personnel records in the archive room. He just needed to find Liang Bo’s address and contact information, then he could find him after work.

Nan Gong Fei sat in the office as Su Nantian had said, waiting patiently. When he saw Su Nantian enter, he immediately asked, “How did it go? Did you succeed?”

Su Nantian held back the urge to roll his eyes and said, “Not yet. Come with me to the archive room and help me find someone’s records.”
