“Of course not, you must have heard wrong,” Cao Yun denied vehemently, determined to keep her secret from them, fearing they might deduce the thoughts in her heart from that tiny clue.

Zhang Mengyao clearly sensed Cao Yun’s hostility.

Women's intuition told her this hostility stemmed from Su Nantian.

In truth, Zhang Mengyao knew exactly what Cao Yun had said, for she had been counting Su Nantian’s laps—ten in total. Thinking of this, Zhang Mengyao's gaze darkened, and she instinctively touched the scar hidden beneath her bangs.

“Cao Yun, tell me—why is Su Nantian so strong? He’s almost done with twenty laps, and he’s not even breathing heavily.”

Cao Yun scratched her knees before feigning indifference: “I don’t know. Maybe he was trained from childhood.”

“Oh, right…” the girl nodded as if enlightened.

Meanwhile, several instructors gathered to discuss.

“You’ve got a student who’s quite remarkable—he actually endured it,” one said.

“Indeed, his arrogance was worth it.”

“Chen Ping, look! This is already the tenth lap,” another instructor remarked, pointing at Su Nantian.

“Stop being so startled. What about your basic military discipline?” Chen Ping shot back without even looking up.

But after a brief glance, he was stunned: “Damn, what’s his move!”

“Seems you’ve got a gem here. If he were ours, that’d be ideal.”

The two instructors shook their heads in admiration. After seeing the scene, Chen Ping scratched his head, thinking about how to resolve the bet he had made. His gaze toward Su Nantian now carried a touch of admiration.

Unbeknownst to others, after parting ways with the two students, Su Nantian’s speed had increased by more than double and kept rising. It seemed he possessed inexhaustible energy, with each lap faster than the last—having lapped those two students many times over. He moved like a leopard with wind beneath its feet, so fast it was hard to catch his form.

He finished the ten laps and stopped, while the other two had barely completed one.

“Wow!”

“How could he be so strong!”

The crowd was stunned, their mouths gaping wide enough to fit an egg.

Cao Yun stood up excitedly, and the other girls around her clapped enthusiastically. One girl grabbed Cao Yun’s sleeve and bounced excitedly: “Cao Yun, Cao Yun! Su Nantian is really amazing! I think I’ve fallen for him!”

Cao Yun felt her classmates radiating pink bubbles, but despite wanting to express her admiration like them, her upbringing kept her shy.

As she watched Su Nantian surrounded by girls offering him water and towels, Cao Yun sighed silently in her heart.

Zhang Mengyao’s mind was also unsettled—she had never imagined Su Nantian could be so strong.

Su Nantian casually took a bottle of water.

“Clap.” He unscrewed it and drank, the sunlight casting an enchanting aura over him.

He radiated youthful energy.

This made Zhang Mengyao lose herself in admiration, wishing she could be one of those girls offering him a towel or water.

At that moment, Su Nantian turned and caught Zhang Mengyao’s gaze. He grinned.

The sight of his smile caused the surrounding girls to shriek in delight, sending countless hearts into chaos.

“Rascal,” Zhang Mengyao muttered, her face flushed beneath her bangs as she whispered the words.

“Oh~ Su Nantian’s done! Instructor, instructor, hurry and accept the challenge!”

A group of students rushed over to the instructors to fulfill their bet. Another instructor asked, “What’s going on, Chen Ping?”

Chen Ping hesitated before saying, “Ah… we made a bet. The loser would sing ‘Conquer’.”

“Hahahaha, I never thought it’d be you today. Go on, go!” He even pushed Chen Ping.

Chen Ping realized he couldn’t back out and reluctantly stepped forward, head bowed: “Thus you’ve conquered me… cutting off all escape routes.”

“Ooooh~”

The crowd erupted in cheers.

Su Nantian chuckled at the chaos, shook his head, and sat down on an empty spot.

After about ten minutes, the two students finally exhausted their last bit of strength and collapsed on the finish line, lying there, gasping for breath, too exhausted to move.

Thinking of Chen Xiuyan’s earlier bizarre act, their self-respect was shattered. How could the gap be so vast when they had both completed nine years of compulsory education?

That speed—world champions would struggle to match it.

Recalling Chen Xiuyan’s words in their ears, they felt sheer terror. If he used that speed for patrol, it would be pure ecstasy.

Both shook their heads in self-deprecation.

欢乐的时光总是过得非常快, as Chen Ping’s command rang out,

“Formation!”

Upon hearing the order, they all put down their things and reluctantly ran toward the gathering spot.

“Ah!”

A scream echoed. Those nearby turned around to see Cao Yun crouched on the ground, clutching her ankle.

Her friend Li Yilan rushed back to help her.

“Stop! My ankle is sprained,” Cao Yun’s face was contorted in pain.

“Ah, sorry. Are you okay?” Li Yilan, realizing the severity, didn’t know where to put her hands and could only awkwardly support her.

Cao Yun waved her hand, gritting her teeth through the pain: “I’m fine… we should go quickly; there’s still formation.”

“Maybe I should tell the instructor to let you rest for a while.”

Cao Yun’s heart fluttered at the thought, and she quickly grabbed Li Yilan’s sleeve: “Don’t… we’ve just started training. I don’t want to leave a bad impression…”

“Look at you, still being stubborn,” Li Yilan sighed as she saw Cao Yun’s determined gaze. “Fine, do as you wish.”

With that, she carefully guided Cao Yun back to the group.

Military training was always monotonous. Most of the time, they stood in formation, but this was a relief for Cao Yun.

Chapter 173: Sprained Ankle

Twenty minutes passed, and some had already given up. Li Yilan worriedly glanced at Cao Yun; seeing no major reaction, she felt a little reassured.

After thirty minutes, Cao Yun felt dizzy, sweat pouring down her face. Her foot was swollen to the point of being unrecognizable. She glanced down and saw it had swelled significantly.

She could no longer endure, and as she felt her vision go dark, the last thing she heard was Li Yilan’s shout before passing out completely.

As Cao Yun was about to collapse, Su Nantian took a step forward and caught her, then carried her in front of everyone’s astonishment.

Unbeknownst to others, Su Nantian had noticed Cao Yun's awkward stance while standing in formation but hadn’t dared to act. He had hoped she could endure, so he kept a close watch for any mishap.

Sure enough, she fainted shortly after.

The instructor approached to inquire and ordered everyone to continue standing. He specially permitted Su Nantian to place Cao Yun aside.

Other girls envied as they saw Cao Yun cradled in Su Nantian’s arms.

Su Nantian held her gently, lifting her slightly. He hadn’t expected this girl to be so plump despite appearing thin.

He carried her under a tree and gently placed her down.

A few seconds later, Cao Yun opened her eyes, surveyed the surroundings and understood what had happened. But upon seeing Su Nantian’s face before her, she blushed.

Stumbling over how to thank him, Su Nantian seemed to sense her awkwardness: “You fainted. I brought you here. However, your foot seems sprained. Would you mind if I checked it?”

Su Nantian crouched in front of Cao Yun, gazing at her seriously.

As soon as he spoke, Cao Yun instinctively pulled back her foot with a gasp, accidentally pulling at the wound and earning Su Nantian’s snort of laughter.

“Hurry up. My family's traditional Chinese medicine will help you.”

Traditional Chinese medicine? Cao Yun hadn’t expected that. And it was her foot—how could she let him see it in broad daylight?

Cao Yun politely declined: “No need. Let my mom take me to the hospital.”

Su Nantian realized she wouldn’t give in, so he stepped forward and stared into her eyes: “You’re really stubborn. If you wait any longer, your foot might break.”

Cao Yun…

After Su Nantian said that, he didn’t wait for her response. He gently removed her shoe and revealed her pale little foot, its toes curling involuntarily.

Su Nantian first lifted her foot and examined it before saying softly: “You’ve already injured yourself so much, yet you still insist on being strong.”

Then he pressed a few acupoints.

“Ah…” Cao Yun let out a scream.

She instinctively tried to pull her foot back, but Su Nantian wouldn’t let her.

“Just endure a little; it’s painful at first.”

Su Nantian infused a bit of spiritual energy into Cao Yun’s sprained ankle. She felt a warm, tingling current at the wound, and the pain lessened significantly.

“Mmm～～～”

Cao Yun let out a soft moan, her face turning red instantly.

“See? I was right. It’s just painful at first. Now isn’t it comfortable?” Su Nantian smiled.

“Mmm.”

Hearing this, Cao Yun’s face turned even redder. She endured the strange sensation from her foot and whispered in response.

Su Nantian smiled but said nothing. He could guess what she was thinking.

Soon, Su Nantian stopped.

“Why did you stop?”

Cao Yun felt the tingling sensation in her ankle disappear and asked instinctively.

“It’s already healed.”

Cao Yun widened her eyes, staring at her ankle that had returned to normal. There was no sign of injury anymore.

Today she noticed the skin on that spot was slightly whiter than the surrounding area. Though the difference wasn’t significant, she still noticed it.

She looked up at Su Nantian in surprise.

Su Nantian smirked and leaned toward Cao Yun’s ear: “How about now, do you believe me?”

He was then met with a flurry of punches to his chest.

The girls standing in formation watched enviously.

They sat quietly until afternoon dismissal, when the field was chaotic.

Li Yilan approached Cao Yun and checked her ankle. Seeing it was fine, she sighed: “I was so worried about you, Cao Yun. I wish I had asked for leave earlier.”

“Nothing serious. Besides, it was Su Nantian who healed me, right?” She shook her foot and found no pain at all. The surface had even left no scar.

Li Yilan gasped, covering her face: “What? It was Su Nantian who healed it? I thought it wasn’t that serious! Is he a miracle doctor?”

Cao Yun pushed her shoulder gently when she heard Li Yilan’s loud voice.

Li Yilan realized she had been too noticeable and quickly covered her mouth, whispering an apology.

Others had already overheard Su Nantian healing Cao Yun’s ankle. Some envied how Su Nantian had won the favor of the goddess, while others envied Cao Yun for being carried by Su Nantian so long.

Su Nantian placed his hands behind his head and approached Zhang Mengyao from behind.

“Smack.” He patted her round head.

Zhang Mengyao turned, glaring at the aggressor, hoping to see some remorse. Naturally, there was none.

Su Nantian took a step forward and turned back to remind her: “What are you waiting for? Come on.”

Zhang Mengyao reluctantly followed.

After discussing with her friend Li Yilan, Cao Yun recalled Su Nantian’s presence and hurriedly stood up to thank him. But where was Su Nantian? She looked around, only catching a glimpse of his back as he exited the field, with Zhang Mengyao following.

Why were they so close? He was just a classmate!

Cao Yun stomped her foot and cursed under her breath before dragging Li Yilan away.

Zhang Mengyao felt a shiver as she sensed someone watching her. She felt uncomfortable and touched her face, feeling the heat of shame from being stared at.

The crowd saw Su Nantian and Zhang Mengyao together again, and they started gossiping.

“Su Nantian, what’s wrong with you? Is your taste bad? I thought he was normal before.”

“Exactly. He just helped the beautiful Cao Yun heal her sprain, and now he’s gone to find Zhang Mengyao.”

“Don’t know what curse the ugly Zhang Mengyao cast on Su Nantian!”

“Exactly, I saw that birthmark on Zhang Mengyao’s face and felt like vomiting.”

Chapter 174: Arena Duel

After saying that, the person imitated vomiting and caused everyone to laugh.

Zhang Mengyao glanced at Su Nantian, tall and handsome with a face like a crown, his features sharp—far superior to these people.

Yet Su Nantian never showed the slightest disdain for her, and even his gaze didn’t carry any contempt.

She lowered her hand covering her face, standing awkwardly beside Su Nantian. Her confidence gradually weakened.

This subtle change was naturally noticed by him.

Years of cold mockery—she must have been accustomed to it. But even if she was, deep down, she couldn’t let go.

Few could imagine how she had endured it. But Su Nantian understood well, for he too had made his way through mockery and scorn, using strength to crush those people.

Zhang Mengyao just needed an opportunity—something to regain her confidence.

Su Nantian’s expression turned cold, and he cast a sharp glance at the most vocal group.

Those who met his gaze felt a shiver and immediately closed their mouths. Some turned their heads away, others walked off, fearing Su Nantian would beat them up. Shen Fei’s incident was the best example—this beautiful university life had just begun, and they didn’t want to offend this big monster and become the next person in the hospital.

Instantly, the previously lively crowd fell silent. They looked around as if they hadn’t seen Su Nantian and Zhang Mengyao, discussing trivial matters.

Zhang Mengyao naturally noticed the sudden change. Though she kept her head down, her peripheral vision had been watching the surroundings all along. She found it strange that they suddenly became silent.

Normally, gossiping about her should have been the most interesting thing right now. Why did they stop so suddenly?

Now seeing the crowd go cold, Zhang Mengyao was confused. She looked up at Su Nantian.

Beside her, Su Nantian smiled and gazed at her with a bright smile.

He extended his large hand to pat Zhang Mengyao’s head.

At the touch, she instinctively cringed and her face turned red.

Su Nantian rubbed Zhang Mengyao’s head and said, “It's okay now.”

Hearing Su Nantian’s gentle words, Zhang Mengyao nodded shyly.

The female students in the crowd were all resentful and gritted their teeth. Especially Cao Yun, who was behind Su Nantian and Zhang Mengyao, clenched her dress with her nails digging into her flesh.

As they prepared to continue walking out of the field, before even stepping halfway, they saw a group of people approaching with an imposing presence.

Su Nantian sensed a different aura. These people were coming for him.

Sure enough, when the group approached, Su Nantian saw they all wore Taekwondo club uniforms or had badges of the Taekwondo club.

Everyone understood immediately—this was likely a group from the Taekwondo club coming to cause trouble for Su Nantian. And among those who had sneered earlier, many were laughing quietly.

This made Zhang Mengyao frown more and look down on them even more.

Su Nantian remained expressionless as he looked at these tough guys. The Taekwondo club had a long history in the school and was considered a representative of strength. The club’s entry requirement was to have a strong physique.

Therefore, Zhang Mengyao saw these tough guys and started to feel nervous.

Su Nantian didn’t seem too concerned. He met challenges with his strength, and he had no fear of these people.

As Su Nantian was unimpressed by the group, a muscular man stepped forward. Su Nantian immediately understood—this was their leader.

This man looked rough, and apart from his muscles, Su Nantian couldn’t find anything worth noticing.

The man first stared at Su Nantian from head to toe before sneering and spitting: “Is that you, the one who beat my brother? I tell you, I’m his leader: Long Hu Yan.”

Su Nantian said nothing.

Long Hu Yan glared at Su Nantian and cursed: “Admit it, did you use some underhanded tricks to beat my brother?”

Long Hu Yan’s eyes were full of disdain, thinking Su Nantian must have used some underhanded methods. Otherwise, how could he beat Xu Wenhao with such a “slim” physique?

Plus Su Nantian’s handsome face that deceived people, Long Hu Yan felt even more convinced he was just a pretty boy.

Su Nantian’s lips twitched and he said softly: “I beat Xu Wenhao with my fists. What you’re saying might be your own childish tricks.”

Long Hu Yan was enraged. If it weren’t for the people around, he would have torn Su Nantian apart.

The Taekwondo club members were even more不服气, and one rushed forward to curse Su Nantian: “A dog’s mouth can’t spit out good words. Daring to question our Taekwondo club!”

Long Hu Yan stopped the member and glared at Su Nantian: “Three days later, in the arena. Dare you? Death contract!”

Everyone was startled by this.

Long Hu Yan’s words caused the entire field to gasp.

The Taekwondo club leader was challenging Su Nantian to a duel! And it was a death contract!

Such decisions were usually made between people with deep hatred. It seemed Su Nantian had a big grudge with the Taekwondo club.

It was even enough for the leader to come personally.

This would be a great show. After all, such scenes were rarely encountered; usually, people just sparred on the arena.

There was no such excitement as “either you live or I die.” It was passionate and thrilling.

This school was different from others; fighting outside the arena was forbidden, but it was allowed inside.

It wasn’t clear who set such a bizarre rule.

Frequently, people would disappear and return as if changed. They often appeared on the arena.

There were rumors that they had been taken in by a master and chosen for an extraordinary path.

But no one knew the truth.

Seeing everyone’s shocked expressions, Su Nantian felt a bit of interest. A duel on the arena—he was slightly looking forward to it.

But Long Hu Yan’s mortal body… how many punches could he withstand?

Chapter 175: Departure

It seemed this fellow was going to be a neighbor of Shen Fei again.

Su Nantian shook his head. These small fry weren’t worth his attention.

He watched the clowns with interest.

The Taekwondo club members saw Su Nantian didn’t speak and thought he was intimidated. They laughed heartily: “Look at Su Nantian’s cowardly face. When he beat our Xu Wenhao, he must have used some tricks. Now that our leader is coming for him, he’s scared!”

Long Hu Yan was pleased with this and his face was filled with joy.

Even Zhang Mengyao, who was by Su Nantian’s side, was worried and shook his arm, trying to get him to think twice.

Apologize, admit fault—just do it.

Su Nantian’s lips twitched at this. He was only concerned about Long Hu Yan's durability, but everyone thought he was a coward.

Su Nantian comforted Zhang Mengyao and looked at Long Hu Yan again.

Long Hu Yan’s cultivation level was sixth-tier Qi, which Su Nantian found pitiful. But this level had the qualifications to dominate here.

Unfortunately, he met Su Nantian.

Su Nantian compared Long Hu Yan with Shen Fei and others in his mind, smiled, and thought this big guy could be used to practice punches and stretch his bones.

Then he could exchange experiences with Shen Fei.

Thinking about that scene, it was quite interesting.

After this judgment, Su Nantian readily replied: “Okay. Three days later, on the arena.”

Long Hu Yan was stunned for a moment. Everyone was shocked by Su Nantian’s reaction, and the surroundings became silent.

After a while, they recovered their senses. They thought Su Nantian was just too proud to back down.

Even Zhang Mengyao by his side got worried and wanted to advise Su Nantian, but she was afraid of offending his pride. After thinking it over, Zhang Mengyao directly said to Long Hu Yan: “Long Hu Yan, you’re the leader. You are strong and powerful. Why would you challenge Su Nantian to a duel? That’s not fair!”

Long Hu Yan's eyes lit up. This girl was quite good-looking. He immediately had another plan.

“Hey, if you can let this girl stay with me for a night, I might be a little lighter on the arena and spare your life.”

Long Hu Yan’s face was already full of smiles, looking like a blooming chrysanthemum.

A subordinate nearby was shocked and rushed to Long Hu Yan’s ear, whispering something.

Long Hu Yan's face immediately turned very ugly.

He shouted at Zhang Mengyao: “Damn it, you’re ugly and still came out. Did you scare people? What business do you have with this ugly girl? Stop meddling, and if you talk more, I’ll beat you too!”

Zhang Mengyao shrank back. She had thought that after clarifying Long Hu Yan’s intention, Su Nantian would be cautious.

But she hadn’t expected Su Nantian to remain calm.

That made her even more worried. And for Long Hu Yan’s yelling, she didn’t take it to heart. At that moment, she only cared about Su Nantian’s safety.

Long Hu Yan laughed coldly and stared at Su Nantian: “Three days later, on the arena. Don’t back out.”

“I’m actually worried you’ll back out,” Su Nantian replied calmly.

Long Hu Yan looked at Su Nantian again, but felt no threat. He thought the previous words were even more ridiculous: “You’re quite considerate of women, aren’t you?” Long Hu Yan looked at Zhang Mengyao with disdain: “Make the most of it while you still can. You might not have the chance after you leave the arena.”

With that, Long Hu Yan laughed loudly and turned around to leave. His subordinates also cast disdainful glances at Su Nantian before leaving in a large group.

The news of Su Nantian’s duel with Long Hu Yan spread quickly throughout Fengyue University, causing a stir.

People who had watched the scene on the field started discussing:

“Wow, they really are going to fight?”

“Exactly. It’s definitely happening in three days.”

“Ahh? Su Nantian is so handsome, I wanted to be his friend. What if he gets hurt by Long Hu Yan?” A girl looked at Su Nantian with a rosy face, full of worry.

“That’s easy. Then you’ll have an excuse to go to the hospital and take care of Su Nantian,” a male classmate added: “You’ll save Su Nantian from having to ask for nurses.”

Others joined in: “Exactly, such a big favor. It won’t just be friendship anymore. Maybe it’ll develop into a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship.”

They laughed for a while, and the girl said awkwardly: “You guys are just joking with me. Even if I queue up, it won’t be me to take care of him. Besides, there’s that girl. I don’t understand why Su Nantian has such a unique taste.”

Everyone understood implicitly that the girl was referring to Zhang Mengyao by Su Nantian.

And this voice wasn’t too loud or quiet, but it was just right for Su Nantian and Zhang Mengyao to hear clearly.

People watching the two people who remained calm said: “Acting cool, but you’ll be beaten so badly that you won’t recognize your mother!”

Cao Yun saw Su Nantian being troubled and hurried over, although her ankle had already been swollen after Su Nantian’s massage. She still felt some discomfort and walked a little slower.

She hadn’t expected that when she got close, the group had already left.

But she heard people mocking Su Nantian and scolded them softly: “Why do you have to use verbal violence against classmates?”

Cao Yun didn’t understand why these people always disliked Su Nantian. He was good-looking and could even massage, so he should be welcomed by everyone.

Thinking of Su Nantian healing her ankle, she felt warm inside. She had to do something for Su Nantian to express her gratitude.

With the first person standing up, other girls who admired Su Nantian followed suit.

“Exactly, look at these people, your elbows are out. Su Nantian is a classmate.”

“You guys are looking down on people. That big guy isn’t anything special. Su Nantian definitely won’t lose to him.”

“Didn’t you see how fast Su Nantian ran? How could that guy catch up!”

Cao Yun felt a little happy hearing so many people agree with her.

Chapter 176: Spicy Hot Pot

“You don’t need to do this for me. I don’t care about their thoughts,” Su Nantian shrugged, looking indifferent.

“But I do,” Cao Yun blinked her big eyes, blushing slightly.

“Don’t worry. It’ll be fine.”

After saying that, Su Nantian waved his hand and left the trouble spot with Zhang Mengyao, leaving Cao Yun alone in the wind.

As they stepped out of the main gate, Su Nantian saw Gao Jingjing getting out of a car. He was confused—why had she suddenly come to the school?

Gao Jingjing ran toward Su Nantian: “Nantian.”

Gao Jingjing looked around, seeing Chen Xiuyan had no injuries and sighed in relief.

“Good. You’re not hurt.”

Su Nantian asked confusedly: “What injury? Why are you here?”

She urgently grabbed Su Nantian’s arm and said shyly: “I heard you were going to duel with Long Hu Yan.”

Gao Jingjing briefly told her about what she had heard on the way.

Su Nantian smiled: “I didn’t expect the news to spread so fast. You underestimated me. Don’t worry, even if the sky fell, I wouldn’t be hurt.”

Gao Jingjing still didn’t feel reassured and tightened her grip on Su Nantian’s arm again: “Even if you’re fine today, what about three days later?”

Su Nantian looked at Gao Jingjing’s worried eyes.

“Okay.” Su Nantian interrupted her and placed his hand on Gao Jingjing’s shoulders, gazing into her eyes: “Do you trust me?”

Gao Jingjing nodded slightly.

Su Nantian smiled: “Just trust me. If you have to worry about something, pray that Long Hu Yan won’t be a neighbor of Shen Fei.”

Gao Jingjing didn’t see the slightest fear in Su Nantian’s eyes. After a while, she smiled and nodded.

Gao Jingjing then noticed a strange girl standing beside Su Nantian.

She asked Su Nantian: “Nantian, don’t you want to introduce her?”

Su Nantian smiled and introduced: “This is my classmate, Zhang Mengyao.”

Zhang Mengyao’s face immediately turned red, like a ripe apple.

This was the first time someone had formally introduced her to others. How could she not be nervous? Especially since it was Su Nantian, such a handsome guy.

Gao Jingjing greeted Zhang Mengyao politely. Seeing Zhang Mengyao was just shy, she teased: “I’m not a boy. Why are you so nervous?”

She then took Zhang Mengyao’s hand and smiled: “Since you’re a friend of Su Nantian, then you are also my friend. When we go out, remember to call me.”

She asked curiously: “Where are you going? Are you going back? I just came by car.”

Zhang Mengyao felt awkward when Gao Jingjing asked that. She naturally realized Gao Jingjing and Su Nantian were definitely not just ordinary friends. Possibly…

Thinking of this, her expression darkened. Even if Su Nantian could heal her, she couldn’t compare to this woman.

And the thing she was going to do next was even harder to say.

Shouldn’t she go to her house? That would definitely make Gao Jingjing misunderstand.

If she told her about the treatment, she wouldn’t believe it. How could she show that ugly thing on her forehead?

Just thinking about it made her tremble all over.

Su Nantian noticed Zhang Mengyao’s awkwardness and quickly said: “I had already made arrangements with Zhang Mengyao to talk about something.”

Su Nantian didn’t mention the medical treatment, which made Zhang Mengyao very grateful.

Gao Jingjing was curious but didn’t ask further. Since Su Nantian hadn’t said it, that meant he didn’t want her to know.

She looked at Zhang Mengyao and felt a bit of jealousy. She had a secret with Nantian哥哥 that she couldn’t share, how could she not be jealous?

Gao Jingjing didn’t ask further and felt a strange emotion, but she pretended to be concerned: “Then are you going now? Do you want me to drive you?”

As Su Nantian was thinking of a reason to let Gao Jingjing go first,

Gao Jingjing’s phone in her bag rang. She took it out and saw the caller ID, then answered with a smile.

Gao Jingjing answered the call: “Hello…”

A voice on the other end complained: “Hey, Jingjing, are you at home? Come help me…”

Su Nantian and Gao Jingjing immediately became serious.

“Lianxing, don’t panic. I’m with Nantian. What’s wrong?”

The other end cried: “Can you two come pick me up? I’m on You Sheng Street. My car broke down.”

Gao Jingjing sighed in relief and quickly replied: “Okay, okay. I’ll come pick you up. Don’t panic.”

They confirmed the location again and Gao Jingjing hung up, putting her phone away. She looked at Su Nantian with guilt: “Nantian, I can’t go with you. You go first and take care.”

Su Nantian felt a bit relieved: “Go ahead, be careful on the way.”

Gao Jingjing nodded and said to Zhang Mengyao who was still there: “I’ll go first. See you later.”

Zhang Mengyao didn’t understand what had just happened. Seeing Gao Jingjing say goodbye, she also said a few words: “Hmm, okay, goodbye.”

Su Nantian watched Gao Jingjing’s car drive away and then looked at the foolish Zhang Mengyao beside him, shaking his head.

“Okay, let’s get something to eat and go to your house quickly,” Su Nantian reminded.

Zhang Mengyao quickly agreed: “Okay, let’s go eat spicy hot pot.”

Su Nantian was stunned for a moment and then recovered: “Spicy hot pot?”

Zhang Mengyao licked her lips, nodding like a bobbing top: “Yes. There’s a spicy hot pot place at the school gate. It's really delicious, I tell you.”

After saying that, Zhang Mengyao ran ahead to the store called “Guofu Spicy Hot Pot.”
