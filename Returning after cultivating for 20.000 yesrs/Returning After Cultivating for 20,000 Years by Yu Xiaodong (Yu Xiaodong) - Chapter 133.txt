The servant added another sentence immediately, as if to express his loyalty.

"You’re being too reckless, Wu You’er!"

Wu Chuan spoke with a tone of exasperation, which initially seemed to reflect deep concern for Wu You’er. However, his emotionless eyes revealed that he was seething with anger and deeply dissatisfied with Wu You’er.

"Go down first. I’ll come over right away."

Upon seeing Wu Chuan’s expression, Li Assistant mentally sighed in dismay and waved the servant out.

The servant immediately seemed to regain his vitality, relaxing with a relieved expression before hurriedly retreating.

As soon as the servant closed the door, Wu Chuan hurled a white jade figurine from his desk with force. He let out an angry growl: "Damn it! How dare she defy me like this? It seems I’ve been too lenient with her. She’s forgotten her place entirely!"

How dare she use fasting as a threat against me?

Did Wu You’er truly believe that I would be powerless against her?

She was incredibly naive!

"Master, please calm down. Don’t let anger harm your health."

Li Assistant quickly softened his tone to console Wu Chuan, adding: "Miss Wu You’er is still young and inexperienced. She’s just throwing a childish tantrum. Even if she had a hundred chances, she would never dare defy you."

Li Assistant’s words were not an excuse for Wu You’er or a defense of her. He was simply afraid that he might become an unintended victim of Wu You’er’s anger.

"Amu, come. I’ll go see for myself. Let’s see how far she intends to take this performance."

Wu Chuan narrowed his eyes before suddenly standing up with force, causing the chair beneath him to slide back with a loud noise.

"Hmph! Fasting, is it?"

Wu Chuan said this and still felt unsatisfied, muttering under his breath.

"Yes, Master!"

Wu Chuan was currently in a rage, equivalent to an erupting volcano. Li Assistant quickly responded without hesitation, fearing that one misstep might make him a pawn for Wu You’er.

"By the way, I just fired that servant."

As they reached the door, Wu Chuan suddenly paused as if recalling something. He spoke: "We Wu family don’t need such timid and useless scum!"

"Yes, Master!"

Li Assistant responded immediately, showing no signs of hesitation or delay.

Soon after, Wu Chuan and Li Assistant arrived at Wu You’er’s room.

A group of servants knelt on the floor, all wearing expressions of despair and helplessness. When they saw Wu Chuan, it was as if they had found a savior, and all of them sighed in relief.

They then began to chatter among themselves, reporting to Wu Chuan.

"Master! No matter how we persuade Miss Wu You’er, she refuses to eat!"

"That’s right! These meals have been reheated countless times, yet they were all returned untouched."

"Yes! And Miss Wu You’er wouldn’t even drink water. What are we to do if this continues? Her body will surely give out!"

"Alright, I understand the situation. All of you may leave; I’ll handle it myself."

Wu Chuan raised his hand to interrupt their chatter and dismissed them all.

The servants were all anxious, fearing they might be implicated in Wu You’er’s affairs. Now that Wu Chuan had not punished them and instead waved them away, their hearts finally settled. They quickly apologized and left, fleeing as fast as they could.

Among these servants was a girl with a ponytail. Her face was tender, still bearing the softness of baby fat.

"Why are you still here?" Wu Chuan raised an eyebrow and asked.

Li Assistant waved his hand impatiently, as if shooing a dog: "Didn’t you hear Master’s orders? Go down quickly! What are you still doing here?"

"I… I’m worried about Miss Wu You’er. Master, please don’t be angry with her. She just misses her parents and can't bear to see them, so she’s lost her appetite."

The girl was bold despite being a novice. Her first sentence was reasonable, but the second completely changed tone.

Upon hearing this, Wu Chuan’s face instantly lost its composure. His smile vanished, and Li Assistant was taken aback.

"You’re crazy! What nonsense are you talking about!"

Li Assistant couldn’t help but shout at her, and the girl trembled again. Her face turned pale.

"Good! Good for you, Wu You’er!"

Wu Chuan coldly glanced at the girl before turning his gaze away.

Then, Wu Chuan kicked open the door with a foot. His anger had made the high-quality door crack under his force.

At this moment, no one paid attention to the broken door. They were all stunned by the scene inside.

Wu You’er’s room was littered with ceramic fragments and cold soup. It was easy to guess that this was all Wu You’er’s doing.

Wu You’er lay lifelessly on the princess bed in the center, like a stranded fish, breathing heavily without any reaction to the commotion at the door.

"Miss Wu You’er!"

The girl who had been worried about Wu You’er immediately saw the scene and her eyes turned red. She rushed in without hesitation, ignoring the scattered food and broken pieces, and looked at Wu You’er with concern.

"Are you alright? Please eat something! Even if your mood is bad, don’t take it out on your body!"

The girl’s eyes were red as she continued to persuade Wu You’er, worried about her health: "Please just take a bite?"

"No need to persuade. I won’t eat anything until I see my parents."

Chapter 666: Threatened in Return

"Let me starve to death!"

Wu You’er spoke deliberately, knowing Wu Chuan had arrived. After a day and night without water, her throat was parched as if on fire, and her voice was hoarse and grating.

"Anyway, I don’t have any reason to live."

Wu You’er said this and then whispered softly, her voice so low it was like a dream.

"Hmph! Wu You’er, I underestimated you. Though young, your temper is fierce!"

Wu Chuan knew well that Wu You’er had said this deliberately to provoke him. But Wu You’er was too naive, thinking that by harming herself she could soften his heart and make him let her see her parents.

This only showed that Wu You’er had chosen the most foolish method, one Wu Chuan despised.

"I hate threats."

"I didn’t threaten you."

Wu You’er’s eyes dimmed as she spoke, whispering.

"Don’t pretend to be weak in front of me. Your weakness only scares those who care about you. To me, it’s useless."

Wu Chuan let out another cold laugh and shattered Wu You’er’s illusion. Then he ordered Li Assistant: "Amu, go to the kitchen and bring some hot porridge."

Not eating? He had plenty of methods.

"I won’t eat anything at all."

Wu You’er closed her eyes and, after saying this, clamped her lips shut, biting her teeth tightly without speaking again.

She was gambling—on her value, on Wu Chuan not letting her starve to death.

Upon hearing this from Wu You’er, Wu Chuan said nothing but coldly observed her. Even with her eyes closed, she couldn’t ignore the chilling gaze upon her.

"Master, the soup is ready. This is a broth that has been simmering over low heat in the kitchen."

Li Assistant returned quickly, holding a bowl of chicken soup.

Hearing Li Assistant’s movement, Wu You’er instinctively clamped her mouth tighter. Her teeth ached from biting too hard.

"Hmph."

Wu Chuan saw this and let out another cold laugh. He quickly approached with a bowl of soup, then suddenly grabbed Wu You’er’s chin.

Wu You’er immediately opened her mouth from the physical pain. Wu Chuan didn’t hesitate, forcefully pouring the hot chicken soup into her mouth with a rough motion.

"Ugh... I won’t eat... cough, cough..."

Wu You’er struggled and turned her head, spitting out the soup. The soup was too hot, causing blisters on her mouth immediately.

Moreover, she coughed painfully from the forceful pouring.

Wu Chuan showed no mercy or compassion. His eyes became even more ruthless and cruel.

"Wu You’er, this isn’t the ancient times. I don’t buy your fasting and suicide act."

Wu Chuan spoke coldly, mocking Wu You’er. He continued: "Even if you regurgitate it later, I have plenty of methods to deal with you. 24 hours a day, people will force-feed you. I can even give you injections. You know I’m capable of doing all this, and it’s not just a threat."

At that moment, Wu Chuan still wasn’t satisfied. He continued coldly: "Oh right, they say debts are repaid by the children. So let your parents repay their debt!"

"Wu Chuan! What are you going to do to my parents?"

Wu You’er immediately widened her eyes, roaring like a caged beast: "If you want to punish me, do it. Don’t touch them!"

"Unfortunately, you’re disobedient. I can only punish you."

Wu Chuan let out another cold laugh and said: "You may continue to harm yourself, fast again. But your parents won’t have such good treatment. If you skip a meal, they’ll miss one day."

After saying this, Wu Chuan turned to Li Assistant: "Order that Wu You’er has missed four meals. Let her parents starve for four days. During these four days, nothing but water is allowed to be given to them!"

"Wu Chuan! You dare!"

Wu You’er immediately became anxious, her eyes wide and furious: "You can’t do this!"

"I can’t?"

Wu Chuan seemed to have heard a farce, as if it were an amusing joke. He raised his eyebrows and laughed mockingly before the smile vanished, returning to his cold and ruthless demeanor: "I’ll see how strong your parents’ lives are. How many days can they endure under your self-destruction?"

"Fool! Wu Chuan, you’re a fool!"

Wu You’er could no longer remain calm. She had been constantly threatened by Wu Chuan with her parents, and she was almost suffocating. She let out a desperate scream: "You could have been the head of the family yourself! Why did you push me to take over? Why did you choose me?"

"Wu Chuan! You’re a fool! A pervert! May you die!"

Wu You’er continued to scream desperately. She was almost desperate, and her voice cracked from the intensity. After shouting, she began to cough painfully.

She even coughed up horrifying amounts of blood—pools after pools...

Wu Chuan had already reached the door when he heard Wu You’er’s shout. His steps suddenly halted.

Although Wu Chuan said nothing, the atmosphere around him changed.

The air seemed to be abruptly sucked away. The temperature began to drop rapidly, becoming colder and colder until it felt like freezing one into ice.

"Miss Wu You’er! Don’t be reckless. Stop talking!"

The girl who had been worried about Wu You’er hadn’t expected her to be so stubborn or bold. In this situation, she still dared to speak such harsh words in front of Wu Chuan.

Even Li Assistant showed an expression of shock, not expecting Wu You’er to dare say such things.

This time, even Li Assistant agreed with the girl’s words. He thought Wu You’er was risking her life by challenging Wu Chuan, who had the reputation of a living阎王 (Yan Wang).

"Master, Miss Wu You’er must be starving mad. Please don’t take it to heart; don’t let it harm your health."

Li Assistant quickly stepped forward, trying to console Wu Chuan.

Chapter 667: Defiance

"Master! Please calm down!"

Li Assistant continued to persuade Wu Chuan, fearing that he might lose his temper and kill Wu You’er.

Although Li Assistant had no feelings for Wu You’er, even if she were killed by Wu Chuan, it wouldn’t matter. However, Li Assistant was worried that if Wu You’er died, it would interfere with their plan.

After all, Wu Chuan had planned for so long. No one could disrupt it; otherwise, the effort would be in vain.

That was why Li Assistant kept softening his words to Wu Chuan, hoping he would stay calm. Otherwise, given Wu You’er’s audacity to curse Wu Chuan like this, even if Wu Chuan didn’t react, Li Assistant would have wanted to kill Wu You’er for venting his anger.

Looking at Wu You’er’s attitude, she was worth nothing to be pitied or mourned.

Thinking of this, Li Assistant continued to persuade Wu Chuan: "Master, please calm down. The grand plan is important; don’t let it harm your health!"

The girl who had gone to inform earlier was also terrified upon seeing the scene. Especially when she saw Wu You’er daring to challenge Wu Chuan, who represented supreme authority in the Wu family, she turned pale with fear.

"Miss Wu You’er! Please stop talking. Please apologize to the Master!"

The girl now was also urging Wu You’er, as frightened as Li Assistant. Although she didn’t understand much, after working in the Wu family for so long, she knew that Wu Chuan was the one with ultimate power. To defy him meant certain doom for Wu You’er.

"Miss Wu You’er! Please apologize quickly!"

Thinking of this, the girl continued to urge Wu You’er, fearing she would say more harsh words.

At this moment, however, Wu You’er was completely driven mad by Wu Chuan’s words. She had lived well with her parents before, but Wu Chuan suddenly appeared and forcibly took her family back.

After being taken back, Wu Chuan demanded she become the head of the Wu family, isolating her and placing her on a seemingly powerful position. In reality, all matters of the Wu family were under Wu Chuan’s control.

It was entirely Wu Chuan, a deceitful and treacherous man, who secretly manipulated everything!

That was enough. Wu Chuan now threatened her parents and wouldn’t let her see them, nor could she confirm their safety. How could Wu You’er stay calm?

She now longed to bite into Wu Chuan’s flesh and drink his blood. Even his bones would be crushed and chewed!

"Apologize? What did I do wrong?"

Wu You’er let out a cold laugh. This time, she had truly given up everything! Her eyes were fierce: "The one who is wrong is him!"

Wu You’er said this and pointed directly at Wu Chuan: "Him! Wu Chuan!"

"Reckless!"

Before Wu Chuan could speak, Li Assistant shouted at Wu You’er: "Is it appropriate for you to call the Master’s name so freely? Miss Wu You’er must be tired of living and has become lawless. How dare you show such disrespect to the Master!"

After scolding Wu You’er, Li Assistant furrowed his brows and stared at her as if he would not let her speak again.

"Ha! Reckless? He is just an elder in the Wu family. I am the head of the family. What is reckless about it? The ones who should be reckless are you! And you, Li Mu! You’re just a servant of the Wu family. You are nothing! When did you dare to act like this in front of me!"

Wu You’er was so angry she laughed. She didn’t care and even criticized Li Assistant.

Her words couldn’t be faulted at all. On the surface, Wu You’er was indeed the highest-ranking person in the Wu family. Unfortunately, she was just a fake, a puppet!

So these words from Wu You’er sounded even more harsh.

"You!"

Li Assistant was so angry he felt short of breath. His chest rose and fell rapidly, his face turning red.

He had been by Wu Chuan’s side for years. As the saying goes, when one rises, all others benefit. With Wu Chuan around, no one in the inland port would dare to disrespect Li Mu. Not even within the Wu family, let alone a young girl without power like Wu You’er!

"Amu."

At this moment, Wu Chuan suddenly raised his hand to interrupt Li Assistant’s angry words and gave him a look that said, "Stay calm."

Li Assistant was reluctant but had to suppress his anger and follow Wu Chuan’s instructions.

When Li Assistant finally calmed down, Wu Chuan turned his gaze to Wu You’er. His eyes were fierce and filled with clear hostility.

Then, Wu Chuan spoke sharply, each word like a sharp knife cutting into Wu You’er’s body and carving deep wounds in her heart.

"Wu You’er, without me Wu Chuan, you are nothing. Not even a chance to tie anyone’s shoes in the inland port."

Wu Chuan said this, paused for a moment, and then continued with cruel intent: "You dare to curse me? Curse, continue cursing. Say whatever you want; I won’t interfere with you."

When Wu You’er heard this, she was momentarily stunned. She instinctively looked up at Wu Chuan and was stunned when he spoke again.

Because Wu Chuan said: "You may continue to act childish as you please. I won’t argue with you. But every word you say, I will take back from your parents. You care about them most, so watch as they are tortured by me!"

Wu Chuan had now regained his usual composure. Although he was extremely angry at Wu You’er’s harsh words, he hadn’t reached the level Li Assistant thought. His mind was still clear.

"Don’t do this!"

Wu You’er heard Wu Chuan still threatening her parents, and her eyes widened again. Her eyes, which had once shone like stars, were now obscured by thick fog, revealing no light.

"No, I can’t."

Wu Chuan saw Wu You’er’s painful expression and felt his mood improve. He interrupted her whisper, his voice growing colder each time: "If you don’t mind them getting more whips, go ahead and curse. The harsher the words, the better!"

After saying this, Wu Chuan coldly stared at Wu You’er, his face showing confidence as if he didn’t regard her at all and had no need to worry about her.

Chapter 668: Too Late

"Don’t, Wu Chuan. I beg you, Uncle! You can’t do this to my parents. They are not just my parents; they are also your brother and sister-in-law. You can’t torment them like this..."

Wu You’er showed a painful expression. She had already regretted it, realizing she shouldn’t have challenged Wu Chuan like this!

Wu Chuan was right. Defying Wu Chuan was like an egg hitting a stone; it was destined to lose and would never succeed!

Now, she had gained nothing but caused her parents to be involved. Wu You’er felt even more desperate and began to beg Wu Chuan, hoping he would show mercy for their past relationship and spare her parents.

"Ah, you’re right about one thing."

At this moment, Wu Chuan spoke with an even more merciless gaze: "If it weren’t for the relationship, your words would have made them dead instead of just a small punishment."

"No!"

Wu You’er’s eyes widened again, her pupils contracting.

Wu You’er opened her mouth to desperately beg Wu Chuan to spare her parents, but at this moment she didn’t know why, no matter how wide she opened her mouth, she couldn’t make a sound.

Wu You’er could only desperately hug Wu Chuan’s legs, hoping he would spare her parents.

At this moment, Wu Chuan didn’t speak again but kicked Wu You’er away with a fierce kick. He then strode towards the door.

When he reached the door, Wu Chuan suddenly stopped and didn’t turn back. He let out a cold laugh before speaking coldly: "Wu You’er, if you truly don’t want your parents to pay for your recklessness, you’d better not make these useless little moves."

With that, Wu Chuan and Li Assistant left directly.

They left behind a mess and a soulless Wu You’er, who was powerless and lost.

Wu You’er collapsed on the ground helplessly. Her eyes were lifeless, staring at the ceiling above her. The back of her neck and back began to sweat profusely, leaving her unable to get up again.

"Miss Wu You’er! Are you alright?"

The girl was also terrified by the scene. Only after Wu Chuan and Li Assistant left did she regain her senses.

The girl immediately ran over to help Wu You’er up. When she touched Wu You’er’s skin, she was startled: "So cold!"

"Miss Wu You’er! Are you alright?"

The girl asked again, concerned about Wu You’er.

But Wu You’er seemed to have lost her soul. She was like a marionette, unable to hear any external sounds.

Her face was pale with no color at all. Even the color of her lips had vanished completely, making her look as if she would collapse at any moment and was extremely weak.

"Parents... I’m sorry. It’s all my fault. It’s Wu You’er’s mistake..."

Wu You’er’s mouth moved, but she couldn’t make a sound. She only whispered lowly, and even the girl beside her couldn’t understand what Wu You’er was saying.

"Miss Wu You’er? Head of the family?"

The girl was terrified by Wu You’er’s current state and didn’t know what to do. She struggled to help Wu You’er up, but she was uncooperative and completely limp, making the girl exert all her strength without success.

"What to do? What to do..."

The girl was anxious, breaking out in sweat. She bit her lip and muttered anxiously: "What to do..."

Suddenly, the girl had an idea. She thought of a plan.

"Miss Wu You’er! You can’t go on like this. If your parents know, they’ll be worried about you, right?"

"Parents..."

Indeed, when she heard the words "parents," Wu You’er finally reacted. Her lifeless eyes regained a bit of vitality, but the pallor on her face was still very obvious, making people feel pity.

"Yes! It’s your parents!"

The girl saw Wu You’er had reacted and was secretly happy. She nodded rapidly, continuing to talk about Wu You’er’s parents. Only by doing so did she manage to help Wu You’er onto the bed.

"Ugh—"

This short distance made the girl’s hair sweat wet. After helping Wu You’er onto the bed, she sighed in relief and quickly wiped her forehead.

"Miss Wu You’er, rest for a while. I’ll go to the kitchen and bring you something to eat. You haven’t eaten for a day and night, your body will be worn out!"

The girl added another叮嘱 (caution), then quickly ran to the kitchen to prepare some food for Wu You’er.

After the girl left, Wu You’er’s room returned to silence again.

Wu You’er lay weakly on the bed, still without color. She continued to stare at the ceiling and whispered softly: "Su Nantian, why haven’t you come to save me? I’m about to give up..."

When Wu You’er said this, her eyes suddenly spilled a hot tear. This tear slid from the corner of her eye, down her cheek, and finally disappeared on the pillow.

Wu You’er raised her hand to cover her eyes, intending to wipe away the tears. However, this action made her tears flow even more profusely, soaking her palm.

Wu You’er continued to whisper softly with a voice full of tears: "Su Nantian, you’re too slow. It’s really so slow. Can you hurry up..."

"Ugh?"

In the Southern Palace, Su Nantian seemed to sense Wu You’er’s call. His chest suddenly felt闷 (stuffy), and his heart skipped a beat.

He looked up at the sky as if questioning it. He noticed that the bright, round moon had been completely obscured by clouds. The clouds were connected one after another, occupying the entire sky as if a big mouth was opening and about to swallow everything.

The dark clouds were oppressive, making it hard to breathe. People felt heavy under this sky.

Su Nantian saw this weather change and furrowed his brows, feeling even more沉重 (heavy).

Su Nantian narrowed his eyes and carefully observed the sudden change in the weather. He muttered: "The weather has changed."

Su Nantian whispered this, and his chest felt even more闷 (stuffy). He had always trusted his sixth sense and believed that this change was not sudden. It must have been a hint.

"It seems the situation has started to change."

Su Nantian whispered again, his eyes becoming more serious. His features were resolute, and his expression turned solemn.

Chapter 669: Situation Changed

"It can’t be delayed any longer."

Su Nantian felt a sense of urgency, his voice carrying a heavy tone.

After that, Su Nantian gazed deeply at the sky that made people feel heavy before turning his gaze back.

It seemed everything had to be accelerated, and he needed to complete his task as soon as possible.

The next morning, Su Nantian followed South Palace Ping’s instructions to check the cargo at the port. He also took the opportunity to contact his subordinate, Qi Yinzhen, to see if they had found any useful clues that could speed up this mission.

"Ah, thank you all. The young master specially ordered the restaurant. Everyone can go eat together later."

Su Nantian was thinking about his mission while watching the workers loading goods.

After everyone had finished organizing, Su Nantian warmly invited all the workers to go eat at a restaurant. This not only showed South Palace Ping’s generosity but also created an impression, and it demonstrated the family's magnanimity.

Workers would get their wages and enjoy deserved benefits. They naturally worked harder and were more dedicated, and their favor for the South Palace family would also increase.

Upon hearing Su Nantian’s warm hospitality, the workers all showed happy expressions: "Thank you! Please tell the young master on our behalf!"

"No problem."

Su Nantian smiled again, showing no airs. His personality was such that he could get along with anyone.

"Senior Tian! Senior Tian!"

As Su Nantian said goodbye to the workers, he heard someone calling him.

He turned around and saw it was Li Zhe.

"What’s up? Any instructions?"

Su Nantian raised an eyebrow, his tone was always serious but with a touch of casualness. However, Su Nantian’s eyes were very focused. Since the last time Li Assistant had sent Li Zhe to deliver a message and arrange a meeting, Su Nantian had been paying special attention to Li Zhe.

Although it was certain that the South Palace family would have people planted in the Wu family, it turned out to be Li Zhe, who had been lurking within the South Palace family since so early on and now held such a position.

Just thinking about it, Su Nantian felt that Li Zhe was indeed someone chosen by Wu Chuan. Just like him, he wasn’t someone who would easily back down. Both were people with meticulous minds.

If it weren’t for Li Zhe actively seeking him out, Su Nantian might not have guessed their relationship.

Thinking of this, Su Nantian’s eyes became even more serious. This lesson reminded him never to underestimate any insignificant person again.

On the contrary, he must remain fully alert and vigilant about everything and everyone.

"Hey, what instructions? Like Senior Tian’s status needs me to give you any instructions? It should be I who asks for your guidance!"

Li Zhe laughed and rubbed the back of his head, speaking politely with flattery.

"Alright, don’t talk about this nonsense. Everyone went to eat. What are you still doing here?"

Su Nantian glanced at Li Zhe with his eyes and asked casually.

"I just haven’t seen Senior Tian for a long time. I wanted to chat with you."

Li Zhe laughed again, pretending to just want to talk and build a relationship. After saying this, Li Zhe quickly took out a pack of cigarettes.

Li Zhe patted his head and said: "I’m such an idiot! Senior Tian, this is a new product. I had to use my connections to get it. I heard that in the entire inland port, only this place has it! It’s a limited supply. There's none left after 3 PM every day!"

Li Zhe said this and took out a cigarette to give to Su Nantian.

"I don’t smoke."

Su Nantian’s eyes flashed with a quick light. He looked at Li Zhe with more complexity, but it didn’t distract him from answering Li Zhe.

"Ah! I’m such a fool!"

Li Zhe heard this and immediately patted his head, looking very anxious. He then muttered carefully: "It’s really rare. I had to wait in line for a long time to get it. I’ll go back tomorrow and try again at Jinxiao."

Jinxiao was a new nightclub that had just opened. Although it was newly established, it was already popular and received consistent praise from many families in the inland port.

Su Nantian had heard of it before, but now he realized that this Jinxiao nightclub was also not as simple as it seemed. At the very least, it had a connection with Wu Chuan.

He had just thought that Li Zhe’s behavior was different from usual, but now he realized that Li Zhe had used this conversation to pass on a message!

This method of passing messages was clever, as it wouldn’t raise suspicion or leave evidence. It was a very smart way.

"Is it that good? Worth remembering so much!"

Su Nantian teased, then said: "Alright, go eat. Eat well, so you don’t miss out tomorrow."

This sentence seemed casual but actually told Li Zhe that he had received the message.

Wu Chuan’s people had arranged to meet him at Jinxiao nightclub tomorrow at 10 o’clock.

"Got it!"

Li Zhe’s eyes deepened, indicating he understood that his message had been successfully delivered to Su Nantian.

Then Li Zhe chatted with Su Nantian about some trivial matters before saying goodbye and joining the workers to go eat at the restaurant.

It was as if nothing had happened between them, and he hadn’t passed any messages during their conversation.

But they were naturally good friends. Li Zhe was someone Su Nantian had personally promoted, so now they could chat a bit without anyone noticing.

After Li Zhe left, Su Nantian remained in place. He stared at Li Zhe’s back for a while, not knowing what he was thinking.

After a while, Su Nantian came to his senses. He first glanced back several times to ensure no one was present, then took a few steps forward.

After confirming the blind spots of the surveillance cameras, Su Nantian quickly went to the port. He swiftly lifted a tile and took out a sealed small bag from his pocket, placing it under the tile before covering it again.

This action was done quickly and smoothly. After finishing, Su Nantian returned to his original position quickly.

Because the time was short and his movements were fast, even with surveillance cameras, others wouldn’t think he had done anything. They would just think Su Nantian was walking around a bit.

Chapter 670: Regret

"Leave the rest to you, Yinzhen."

Su Nantian whispered and looked back at the tile’s position before quickly leaving.

Not long after he left, a person dressed in tight clothing slipped into the port during the chaos caused by the workers starting their work. He had a clear purpose and quickly reached the spot where Su Nantian had placed something.
