"Reincarnated in the Immortal Realm After Two Thousand Years, Returning Home"

Author: Yu Xiaodong

Blurb:

After Su Nantian cultivated in the immortal realm for two thousand years and ascended to the position of Supreme Immortal, he unexpectedly returned to Earth but found his cultivation restricted. While regaining his power, he overcame five trials and defeated six adversaries, displaying arrogance and defeating rivals. He encountered numerous romantic entanglements, ultimately becoming a king on Earth.

Chapter One: Mother, That Man Is So Handsome

In the nation of Huaxia, in Heilin City.

Tianmu Garden Community.

Building Seven.

"Ring ring—"

The long-forgotten mobile phone rang on the table beside him.

Su Nantian, who had been gazing out the window as if lost in thought, was startled awake.

He stared at the vibrating phone, dazed and bewildered.

Familiar yet strange.

"Here… is this really Earth? I've returned?"

Su Nantian's room was on the first floor.

He had regained consciousness for half an hour, but since he was disturbed by the commotion outside, he had been gazing out the window in a daze.

His mind was still hazy.

He had traversed from an ordinary village to the immortal realm, enduring two thousand years of trials and ascended to the position of Supreme Immortal. Yet, just before his immortal cultivation's final trial, he had experienced a sudden spiritual disturbance and awoke to find himself back on Earth.

He took a moment to sense his body. His immortal energy had completely vanished.

However, his Nascent Soul remained within him.

His right hand extended outward; a slender flame, akin to that of a lighter, emerged from his palm. The blue-violet fire flickered and danced.

His body was still that of a Nascent Soul, but he had lost his spiritual energy?

Su Nantian now understood the situation. Fortunately, the rare and refined purple flame that had merged with his blood still remained.

He flipped his wrist, retracting the violet flame. He answered the phone.

"Su Nantian! What are you doing? There's an important meeting today. You're late! Do you still want to work here? If not, just get out of here!"

The voice on the other end roared with anger.

Su Nantian's sharp eyebrows furrowed slightly.

"I'm not working anymore. You're fired."

His lips parted, and without hesitation, Su Nantian made his decision.

After enduring two thousand years of cultivation in the immortal realm and ruling over countless lives, Su Nantian's character had become remarkably indifferent. The sudden return to Earth had yet to settle, and his current state was unsuitable for engaging with others.

"What! Nantian, uh… you're our company's pillar of support!"

The manager on the other end panicked. He hadn't expected Su Nantian to actually quit over a momentary outburst.

"I've made up my mind. No more discussion. I'll come to handle the resignation procedures later."

Su Nantian coldly hung up the phone. After a moment's thought, he decided to head directly to the company.

Bang bang bang!

"Stupid kid, I know you're in there. Come out! If you have the guts to rescue a beauty, why don't you come out and fight? Wang Ge's woman, do you dare interfere? Come out and get beaten!"

The door was pounded violently with curses.

"Rescue a beauty?"

He recalled an incident. Previously, he had chased Wu Yuanying and she had used him as a shield.

Su Nantian's eyebrows furrowed. If anyone in the immortal realm recognized him, they would immediately know he was angry!

He flung open the door.

Outside stood a group of eight strong men. The leader was a middle-aged man with a buzzcut and tattoos, accompanied by a thin, sharp-featured man who had been shouting.

"You actually came out! Hey, you've got guts. I'll report…"
Smack!

Before the thin man could finish his sentence, Su Nantian's cold expression remained unchanged. He slapped him across the face, sending the man spinning and tumbling out of the building into the grassy area.

He flew four or five meters!

"Chatterbox."

Su Nantian glanced at him indifferently, speaking with disdain.

Click.

The buzzcut man's fierce gaze wavered. The cigarette in his mouth fell to the ground.

"Get him!"

His voice trembled as he barked orders.

The eight strong men felt uneasy but dared not disobey their leader's command.

They rushed forward, one after another.

"Ah! Ghosts! He'll kill us!"
The leader, a stout middle-aged man, was so frightened he fell to the ground and scrambled away.

"Good dogs don't block the path. Move aside."

Su Nantian walked leisurely, yet with each step he seemed to shrink space. He kicked the middle-aged man's backside and sent him flying out of the building.

He continued walking leisurely, his robes fluttering gracefully.

Walking on the street, Su Nantian suddenly remembered an important matter!

His attire was still the imperial robe he had worn in the immortal realm—flowing robes, elegant and luxurious. His long black hair cascaded like a waterfall, his face refined and resolute, his skin as white as fine jade.

His movements were graceful and ethereal. He instantly captured attention, with countless people trailing and surrounding him along the way.

Su Nantian's eyebrows furrowed slightly, sighing inwardly at his oversight.

Yet he showed no hesitation. After all, as a Supreme Immortal, he had been revered by millions. What was the attention of commoners compared to that?

……

"Wow, look! That man over there is so handsome! Mom, I'm about to faint!"

"Is he a celebrity?"

"I feel like he's hundreds of times more handsome than those current pop stars. Sigh, I wish I could bring him home to keep me warm… hehehe…"

Some infatuated girls were typical examples.

"That man's clothes are so strange. It looks like Hanfu, but it's not quite right. Wearing this in the daytime—was he cosplaying?"

……

"Mom, that man is so handsome. I want to marry him!"

"Ruyu, you're only three years old…"

……

"If my mother were fifty years younger, I'd definitely chase after him!"

……

The whispers of passersby had no effect on Su Nantian. He continued walking calmly, radiating a mature and composed masculinity. His appearance and age suggested he was barely in his early twenties.

The crowd ahead obediently cleared a path. Some who had thought he was a celebrity and wanted to get his autograph hesitated upon approaching him, intimidated by his cold demeanor.

Videos captured by passersby further fueled the trend. His divine beauty had emerged, and the video's popularity soared. Unknowingly, Su Nantian became a net celebrity, catching the attention of high-level executives in entertainment companies.

"Shocking! A nobleman in ancient attire did this to a girl on the street!"

"He is who? The dreamy man of the valley!"

……

Arriving at the company's building, the security guards didn't recognize Su Nantian who had worked there for over two years. The gaunt, unattractive youth of before was completely different from the elegant and refined man now.

He passed through without obstruction to the 23rd floor.

"Who is this person?"

"I feel like he's a bit like Su Nantian."

"It can't be! He hasn't seen him for just one weekend. How could it be Su Nantian? They're not the same person."

"But I think his eyebrows and bone structure are just like Su Nantian. Trust me, my face-reading is accurate."

"Cut it out. I believe your ghost story. You're a bad man."

……

Su Nantian ignored it all, as they were merely passing acquaintances. He walked directly to the manager's office in the east. As he approached, he suddenly remembered—had forgotten to write his resignation letter.

"Excuse me. Can I borrow your paper and pen for a moment?"

His lips parted slightly, smiling at the woman sitting at the desk nearby. He glanced at her name tag—Wu Yuanying?

He snorted.

"Ah, okay."

Wu Yuanying was stunned. She hadn't expected a handsome stranger to approach her. Dazedly, she instinctively handed him an A4 sheet and a pen.

Blushing, she examined the man's face. She felt strange—why did he look so much like Su Nantian who had proposed to her last Friday?

It was impossible. Impossible. This man radiated nobility, how could it be Su Nantian, the poor and unattractive one? His looks were so different. That toad still wanted to eat a swan's flesh, hah.

If this handsome and valiant rich man had pursued her, she would have felt proud introducing him to her friends.

Wu Yuanying's thoughts made her smile broadly.

Su Nantian was surprised by the woman's distraction. He shook his head and placed down his pen, taking the completed resignation letter to the manager's office.

"Hey hey, wake up. He's already left."

A fat hand waved in front of Wu Yuanying's face, "Quickly wipe your mouth."

"Where?"

Wu Yuanying snapped out of it and instinctively wiped her lips, blushing as she playfully smacked the colleague teasing her.

A short while later, the manager's office door opened.

Su Nantian walked out with a faint smile. At last, he had resolved this trivial matter.

"Nantian, are you sure you don't want to reconsider? The company can increase your salary."

The fat manager followed him out, sighing.

"No need. Thank you, Manager. That's it. No need to see me out."

As Wu Yuanying was pondering whether to approach the man after he came out, she suddenly heard the manager's words—Nantian? Su Nantian?

Her face turned pale in disbelief.

Inside the office, others were also stunned. Su Nantian?

Seeing Su Nantian's flowing robes and graceful steps as he exited the building, not even glancing in Wu Yuanying's direction, the other people in the office focused their complex gazes on Wu Yuanying who stood dazed.

It seemed that two days ago, Su Nantian had proposed to Wu Yuanying and was harshly rejected. Now, the office imagined a rich man who had come down to work in the grassroots but was met with coldness from the heroine, leading to a dramatic departure. Their gazes now carried pity.

Wu Yuanying regretted deeply. How could it be like this?

"Wu Yuanying, your performance target for this month is increased by thirty percent. If you don't achieve it, prepare to be punished."

The fat manager also recalled the humiliation from last Friday and attributed Su Nantian's resignation to Wu Yuanying. He angrily said it before slamming the door shut, leaving Wu Yuanying in despair.

As Su Nantian exited the CBD building, he received a call.

Chapter Two: Sudden Co-habitation?

"Hey Su Nantian! You must move out today. The rent you owe has been three months overdue. You have to leave by four o'clock this afternoon, as the new tenant is coming."

The landlord's voice roared through the phone.

"Um…"

Su Nantian was bewildered. What was this? He had just started to ask when the other end hung up, leaving only a dial tone in his ear.

Sighing helplessly, he realized the first issue to solve was financial problems.

He checked his account balance. Adding the salary and severance pay he had just received, it was only 4248.52.

Truly pitiful and destitute.

As a Supreme Immortal, how many years had it been since he had worried about such trivial matters?

Su Nantian chuckled self-deprecatingly, sighed, and decided to go home and pack his belongings.

"Su Nantian?"

A voice of doubt echoed behind him.

"Huh? Who called me?"

Su Nantian turned around, bewildered. A red Mini slowly pulled up to the roadside. The window rolled down, revealing a delicate face with large sunglasses.

"What?"

Su Nantian was stunned. He didn't seem to know this fashionable woman.

"Hey, it really is you! Your difference from before is too big."

The girl, with her makeup done perfectly, spoke on her own.

Su Nantian's current appearance had shocked her. If she hadn't been concerned about her image, she would have laughed out loud. Yet, a small worry lingered in her heart—this handsome Su Nantian… did he have a boyfriend?

"Spit spit spit. Impossible. He should be a girlfriend…"

The girl's low mutterings interspersed with their conversation left Su Nantian bewildered.

Su Nantian was completely confused, trying to recall who this self-assured girl was. After all, his memories of Earth were too distant. He awkwardly scratched his head and interrupted her excited chatter, "Um… who are you…?"

"Oh oh, sorry, I forgot."

The fashionable woman smiled apologetically. She removed the sunglasses covering half her face and leaned forward, smiling, "How about now? Do you know who I am?"

"Uh… no."

Su Nantian felt a bit guilty. She had recognized him despite his drastic change in appearance, but he had no recollection of her…

This was the first person who recognized him after his return. It also made him interested in having a conversation, as he would need to adjust his mindset for life in this world.

Moreover, she might have been a good friend before.

"Ah ah, Su Nantian! That's too much. It hurts my heart. I'm your high school classmate, your desk mate! We said we'd share happiness and hardship together. But after just three years, you've completely forgotten me! I'm Lin Suyun, look again."

Lin Suyun was truly upset. Reuniting after such a long time, meeting someone she had missed so much in the vast sea of people, but he didn't remember her. Her feelings were complex; she was self-isolating!

Su Nantian stared at the girl, who had spoken a long string of words without pause. Her eyes were full of resentment, making him feel like a heartless man.

"Oh~!" Su Nantian suddenly realized. He stretched out the tail of his voice, and under Lin Suyun's expectant yet relieved gaze, he calmly said, "Still don't know."

"…"

Lin Suyun's head was filled with several hash marks. She wanted to hit him!

He was so handsome, but that's it! Do you think I'll just leave now?

Lin Suyun muttered in her heart.

Thinking like that, she didn't move. Well, being handsome was a big deal! She would leave only after getting his contact information.

"Okay, I was just joking."

Su Nantian smiled gently. The golden sunset illuminated his face, highlighting the clear contours of his face like a Greek god, with lines of beauty and romantic sensuality.

When Lin Suyun said she was his high school classmate, Su Nantian remembered the girl with braces in his memory. At that time, he was thin and weak, not good at studying, always呆呆的 (dazed). Whenever he was bullied by classmates, she would step in to protect him.

She wasn't particularly beautiful, but she was the most beautiful scenery of his youth.

Recalling those memories, Su Nantian felt warm inside.

Lin Suyun suddenly clutched her chest and took a deep breath. Her heart fluttered.

After some small talk, Su Nantian learned that Lin Suyun had recognized him by the birthmark on his left side.

They had changed so much over the years. They both felt nostalgic.

"Um, where are you going? I'll give you a ride."

Seeing Su Nantian checking the time occasionally, she suggested. She combed her hair and spoke casually.

"No need. That would be too much trouble for you, and you…"

Su Nantian politely declined, not wanting to bother others.

"It's on the way through the city."

Lin Suyun interrupted Su Nantian and smiled, opening the car door on the other side. She gestured for him to enter.

After a little chat, Lin Suyun had no more initial hesitation.

Su Nantian sighed. Well, she had gone this far; it would be impolite to refuse.

Back to Lin Suyun, Su Nantian didn't know she was watching his back. She had made up her mind not to pretend to be a friend and miss him again.

After Su Nantian told the address of the residential area, Lin Suyun happily stepped on the gas. The red Mini drove away on the street, and many passersby regretfully took their eyes off.

The distance wasn't far. They arrived at Su Nantian's rented residential area quickly through conversation.

Lin Suyun helped Su Nantian organize his few belongings. "So your meaning is that you've been kicked out by the landlord and haven't found a place to stay yet, right?"

"Ah, it's really a headache."

Su Nantian was folding clothes by the bed and didn't think much, replying directly.

There was no movement behind him.

As Su Nantian was about to turn around and check, Lin Suyun said, "How about you come live with me? I still have an empty room."

"Ah?"

Su Nantian was stunned. He turned around abruptly, "This isn't good… hey, be careful!"

The room wasn't big. Lin Suyun was standing not far behind him. Su Nantian's sudden movement startled her, causing her to stumble back a few steps and step on a drink bottle. Her foot slipped, and she fell backward.

Su Nantian hurriedly reached out to grab her. Although he couldn't use magic without spiritual energy, his Supreme Immortal body was still intact. He caught Lin Suyun's hand just in time before she collided with the corner of the table, pulling her back.

"Ahh! Erm~"

Lin Suyun felt as if she was flying through the clouds. Her mind was dazed, and she was pulled into a warm embrace. She let out a short gasp, and due to the pressure on her two full mounds, she felt weak. A low, soft moan escaped from her nose.

The warmth of the large hand on her body made her face flush.

Su Nantian's face turned red. He quickly withdrew his hands from her slender waist and the fullness behind her, steadying Lin Suyun's shoulders.

"Um… I said you can come live with me, but it's not free. There's just an empty room. Don't get the wrong idea."

Lin Suyun felt awkward and lowered her head, playing with her hair to change the subject. Her words unintentionally made her feel more embarrassed.

Su Nantian said nothing.

Lin Suyun kept her head down and didn't hear any movement. Her face turned from red to pale, feeling sad. Did she really not interest him? Was she that bad? She had become much more beautiful…

" If you don't want to, I won't force you…"

Lin Suyun stubbornly sniffed and held back tears. She forced a smile to pretend it hadn't happened.

But when she looked up—
She found Su Nantian staring at her, his lips slightly parted.

Seeing she had looked up, Su Nantian gradually lowered his head. Lin Suyun's breath caught. Did she…!
Did he want to…!

"Y-You, what are you doing…"

Lin Suyun was both nervous and shy. Her eyes slowly closed.

Chapter Three: Get Out, My Woman Is Not for You to Covet

But after waiting a while, there was no expected kiss. Not even a light touch!

Lin Suyun opened her eyes in confusion.

"You closed your eyes. I was just helping you remove some dandruff. It's a big piece, look."

Su Nantian said seriously and excitedly, pinching a small piece of white…

Lin Suyun's face stiffened. Then darkened.

"…Die! You idiot! Pig! Don't talk to me anymore!"

Su Nantian looked at the angry Lin Suyun who turned her back on him, even though she didn't want to leave. He sighed in frustration.

"Um…"

Su Nantian cautiously extended a small finger to poke her.

"Don't talk to me! I don't want to talk to you anymore! Didn't you see I'm angry?"

Lin Suyun glared at him and quickly turned back.

After thinking, she turned around again. She looked left and right, then whispered, "Secretly tell you, only if you agree to live with me, I won't be angry."

She quickly turned back and secretly watched him through the corner of her eye.

"…"

Su Nantian's mouth twitched. He sighed, "Okay, okay. I'll go live with you."

"Really! A promise is a promise. Hook your little finger and tie it for a hundred years, no changing!"

Lin Suyun smiled and turned around. She extended her white little hand to hook with him.

Su Nantian covered his face.

"By the way, I don't have much money right now. How much is the rent? I'll pay part of it first, and the rest later."

After cultivating to the level of a Supreme Immortal in the immortal realm, he had no difficulty with such trivial matters. Moreover, he didn't think it was hard to earn money with his current abilities.

"Ah, it's okay. You don't need to pay."

"No, I won't go. I'm not a freeloader."

"Okay, then it's five hundred yuan a month."

"Ah?"

"Okay, one thousand is fine."

"Ah?"

"…Two thousand!"

"Ah?"

"Really just two thousand, it's the market price! If you say 'ah' again, I'll smash your pig head!"

"…Okay."

……

After about ten minutes.

The red Mini slowly stopped.

Su Nantian stood at the door, stunned. "A villa area?"

"Ah, what's wrong? Don't just stand there. Come in quickly."

Lin Suyun didn't think much and walked forward to take out the key.

"…This place, you said two thousand yuan? I believe your nonsense."

Su Nantian smiled awkwardly. He had been tricked again.

Lin Suyun stuck out her tongue and smiled playfully, "Okay, don't be so stubborn. Come on, put your luggage down and tidy the room. We have to go out for dinner later."

"Okay…"

Su Nantian wasn't the type to procrastinate. As a cultivator, he didn't care about trivial matters. He would just pay back later when he had money and help more when needed.

"Su Nantian? Why did you bring a man back! Bastard, stay still. Who allowed you to come in!"

As Su Nantian was about to step into the villa, a man suddenly rushed out from the side.

"Hey? Who's that chicken clucking?"

Su Nantian frowned. How many years had it been since anyone dared to shout at him in front of a Supreme Immortal? Noisy!

He was about to cast a spell to kill him.

But before he could act, Su Nantian suddenly remembered he was now on Earth. His expression became more serious.

"Chen Linyu, I told you not to call me 'Suyun'. We're not familiar. Don't bother me, it's disgusting!"

Lin Suyun saw the man and her face changed. She scolded him to drive him away. She didn't want Su Nantian to be harmed upon his return.

"Spit, you dirty woman. I thought you were a pure lotus, but now you're keeping a little man!"

Chen Linyu was so angry he cursed. He had been pursuing her for over three months without success. Today, after work, he saw her bringing a man in ancient attire back to the villa!

Lin Suyun's face turned pale.

"Hey, little thing. It's not good to insult women. And who is the little man? Huh?"

Su Nantian's tone was calm, his face indifferent. It was like a casual conversation between friends. His eyes were half-lidded.

That mysterious sense of authority made Chen Linyu uncomfortable.

"Hey, what's your problem? There's no way for you to speak here. I'll beat you first!"

Chen Linyu angrily clenched his fists and rushed at Su Nantian.

"Ah—! Don't!"

Lin Suyun screamed in fear, instinctively running toward Su Nantian to block the punch.

Su Nantian looked thin and pale, but he was definitely not someone who could win against the tall and strong Chen Linyu!

However, the distance of seven or eight meters became a chasm. As Chen Linyu's shirt sleeves revealed his dark muscles, Lin Suyun couldn't help but close her eyes.

"Don't—! Chen Linyu, you bastard!"

Boom!

The sound of a collision.

"Ah, my teeth! My teeth!"

A painful scream echoed as expected. But why did this sound not seem like Su Nantian's?

Lin Suyun was confused and opened her eyes. She saw what she had seen.

What did she see?

The previously dominant Chen Linyu was now holding his mouth and sitting on the ground, crying. On the ground were broken teeth and blood.

Su Nantian remained calm, his robes fluttering in the wind. His long hair swayed slightly in the breeze, revealing a sharp profile and a faint smile.

A nobleman of this world.

"Hey, it's really tiring."

Su Nantian sighed.

"Wow, you actually beat him. So amazing. Although I didn't see what happened, it must have been dangerous and difficult. He said he practiced boxing so much, but it's nothing."

Lin Suyun ran to Su Nantian's side.

"Yes, it was difficult. I had to control my strength carefully; otherwise, I might have killed him with just a little."

Su Nantian sighed in frustration. He said this while making a tiny gap with his index and thumb, meaning it was impossible to do even that.

"Hey, you're bragging without a plan. That's over a hundred pounds of man, and even that tiny bit."

Lin Suyun rolled her eyes. She playfully punched Su Nantian's chest with a small hand, thinking he was just joking.

"…This era doesn't believe in truth anymore."

Su Nantian felt a bit helpless. However, he had truly struggled to control his strength.

The power of a Supreme Immortal's body, even without spiritual energy, was enough to punch through a building!

"Damn it! You're still flirting in front of me. Die, you two!"

Chen Linyu glared at them with hatred and ran to his car while they were talking.

"Are you crazy! Stop!"

Lin Suyun heard the sound and turned around. She saw Chen Linyu's face, distorted with hatred, behind the car's windshield. He laughed.

The car backed up and then moved forward.

"Boom—"

He stepped on the gas, aiming directly at Su Nantian and Lin Suyun.

Previously so loving, now after losing her, he hated her more. The Mercedes S450 roared forward with the gas pedal pressed to the floor, covering the short distance in a blink. An ordinary person couldn't dodge.

He was going to die!?

Chen Linyu's wild eyes reflected Lin Suyun's terrified face. Go to hell and repent, you dirty woman. He already saw her lying in a pool of blood!

Su Nantian's eyes narrowed, his feet slightly spread into a small bow stance. His right hand calmly extended.

Boom!

His palm collided violently with the speeding car.

In the security room, a young man was sipping tea made from goji berries. He accidentally saw this scene on the monitor and his hand trembled, spilling hot tea onto his pants. He yelped in pain and jumped up without caring if he was burned, grabbing the walkie-talkie.

"Quickly go to villa 105 in area A. There's a life… uh, it seems nothing happened. My mom, what the hell was that?"

His anxious roar stopped abruptly. The young man stared wide-eyed, his mouth large enough to fit a big eggplant.

On the monitor:

Boom boom boom—

"Move, you bastard! Move!"

No matter how hard Chen Linyu stepped on the gas, the car didn't move. The tires screeched and produced a cloud of white smoke.

And in front of the car was one pale arm.

Su Nantian calmly watched the terrified man inside the car. "Have you had enough? If not, I won't be kind."

"Yes yes yes, enough. You're so generous to let me off this time. I have old people above and… uh, no children yet."

Chen Linyu cried and begged. He was scared. He really was scared.

One hand could hold the car still! How could he play?

His back was already soaked with sweat. He crawled out of the car, trembling and kneeling on the ground.

"Get out, you useless thing. My woman is not for you to covet?"

Su Nantian's face was cold, his eyes narrowed. The aura accumulated over years as a Supreme Immortal overwhelmed Chen Linyu. He felt like he was about to wet himself!

Chapter Four: I'm Really Not a Big Star

Chen Linyu eventually drove away in embarrassment. The car left water stains along the way.

But his vengeful gaze made Su Nantian know this man was still determined. He would need to find an opportunity to deal with him thoroughly.

"Your bladder is quite strong."

Su Nantian smiled playfully.

"What?"

Lin Suyun was confused. She didn't know why Su Nantian suddenly said that.

In the security room, the young man who had wiped his pants with a tissue saw the video and just happened to see Su Nantian say those words. "Spit!" He sprayed tea all over his pants, then looked again at the soaked area and was speechless. "Is this a devil? No, it's not just me who is shocked and spits tea."

Thinking like that, the young man edited the video and added those words at the end. He clicked a few times and sent it to his work group, satisfying the curiosity of those gossips.

The video spread rapidly. "A man with super strength, a hero who can move mountains and dominate the world."

"Mommy, someone used one hand to block a car!"

……

The nickname "Car-Blocker" spread online.

Those who had previously been attracted by his ancient attire and transcendent beauty now realized that this nobleman also possessed such power. It was truly a manly force!

Numerous girls and women were mentally climaxing.

……

But Su Nantian didn't know about this. After dealing with the nameless enemy, he walked into Lin Suyun's villa with her admiration and concern.

After tidying up and changing the bedding, Lin Suyun suggested Su Nantian change clothes. He tried on a few outfits but found they were either too tight or too short.

"I don't know how you managed to live like this…"

Lin Suyun sighed helplessly, feeling a little pity. Had he really been so poor these years?

"Let's go eat first, then I'll buy you some well-fitting clothes."

Su Nantian opened his mouth. This was something he couldn't easily explain. Although the real world had only been a day, in reality, he had cultivated for two thousand years and his body was much taller and stronger.

After a few words, Lin Suyun happily took Su Nantian out to eat and buy some clothes. She was very satisfied with this plan.

On the way, it was okay to sit in the car. But after getting out, Su Nantian felt like more people were looking at him and discussing him.

"Hey, honestly tell me. Did you secretly go to be a star? Why do so many of your fans follow you on the road?"

Lin Suyun was a bit worried, looking around and pulling Su Nantian's sleeve nervously.

"I… I'm not a star. If I were, you would have heard of it, right?"

Su Nantian chuckled.

"That's true. There's no reason they would know you and I wouldn't."

Lin Suyun stuck out her tongue.

They didn't pay much attention to the passersby and walked into the restaurant.
