"Continue. Put more effort into it. Don't let me see you slacking."

Su Nantian spoke carelessly, reminding them as soon as he noticed some moving slower. These villains and henchmen were again startled by Su Nantian's words, quickly resuming their efforts without holding back.

"Good. Otherwise, if I had to act myself, you'd regret it."

Su Nantian nodded in satisfaction, having said nothing wrong. If these people continued to provoke him, he truly wouldn't let them off. Moreover, Su Nantian would never show mercy to such people.

Besides, these villains and henchmen were all bullies who feared strength. If they treated them kindly, the villains would only grow complacent and plan revenge after escaping. This time, their return was proof of that.

After understanding these people's nature, Su Nantian made up his mind to hit them hard. The harder he struck, the better it would be for them to remember.

The villagers watched this scene and cheered Su Nantian enthusiastically: "A Li! That's it! Let us vent our anger!"

"Yes! There's no need to be compassionate towards such people!"

The villagers echoed Su Nantian's words, each looking at him with gratitude. No one thought Su Nantian was wrong.

Nor did the villagers act as saints, urging Su Nantian to spare these villains. They had met a hard nut this time.

The henchmen and villains howled in pain, but no one dared to curse Su Nantian at this moment. Not even a single word was spoken.

They felt that encountering such an opponent as Su Nantian and being punished like this was already a gain. After all, someone as powerful as Su Nantian could kill them with just a flick of his finger.

Just thinking about this, they swallowed their saliva again and dared not act recklessly. Moreover, they quickly resumed their tasks without daring to make a move.

The villagers watched with great interest. Seeing these villains finally get their due, they felt relieved that they would no longer dare to cause trouble. They had been oppressed for a long time, but because they were ordinary people, none of them had the courage to resist. They also knew what would happen if they resisted.

So, they just went along with the flow and even became numb. Some of them had thought about paying protection money to live peacefully.

Fortunately, Su Nantian appeared at this time, sounding the alarm for them and pulling them back from that abyss. If they had truly reached that point, these villagers would have become lifeless corpses, and their lives would have been nothing more than empty shells.

Their souls would have already been sold to the devil. Fortunately, Su Nantian had appeared.

So, after feeling relieved, they were also very grateful to Su Nantian and thanked him for venting their anger. The villagers of the small fishing village felt that Su Nantian had become their guardian deity, always protecting them.

"Enough. It's enough."

Su Nantian saw that they had not held back, each of them striking with full force. He also heard their continuous cries and saw their exposed skin turning purple, so he finally called a stop with satisfaction.

These henchmen and villains felt Su Nantian's voice was like an angel for the first time. After receiving his approval, they all collapsed in exhaustion, but then cried out again from their painful spots.

Su Nantian stepped forward and casually kicked the steel rod in front of him, breaking it.

This action made all the villains and henchmen shudder. They were still afraid of Su Nantian, and now they were scared again, no longer daring to oppose Su Nantian.

"This is my final warning for you. It's also the only chance I give you."

At this moment, Su Nantian spoke coldly. Each of his words struck like a stick on their hearts, making them all pay attention.

Moreover, none of them dared to make any resistance sounds, fearing another sacrifice.

Chapter 790: A Profound Warning

"If you're not satisfied, and there's a next time, then this is what will happen to you."

After saying that, Su Nantian kicked the steel rod again. This time, he even crushed it flat with his foot.

"Ahâ€”"

The henchmen and villains all gasped, scared by Su Nantian's incredible action.

They all nodded and quickly expressed to Su Nantian that they would never dare to cause trouble again.

Su Nantian didn't speak anymore or respond to them. After all, his warning had already been given. If they were still ungrateful, Su Nantian wouldn't mind giving them an unforgettable lesson.

Moreover, there's an old saying: one or two times can be forgiven, but the third time is a blatant provocation.

After punishing these people, Su Nantian quickly returned to the side of the villagers from the small fishing village.

"Wang Li, you're really amazing!"

"Yes! I was scared by you! How come you know everything?"

"Great, you've vented our anger! They've finally received their due punishment!"

The villagers surrounded Su Nantian, enthusiastically praising him. They spoke one after another without stopping.

Su Nantian didn't interrupt them, always keeping a faint smile and accepting their praise without objection.

When they had said enough, Su Nantian finally apologized: "Sorry, everyone. My recklessness brought trouble to the village and also made you get beaten!"

"You're talking nonsense! It was you who vented our anger!" The villagers all refuted Su Nantian's words.

"Yes! If it weren't for you, we wouldn't know how many years we would have been bullied! You helped us!"

The villagers were all reasonable and grateful people. When they heard Su Nantian say this, they didn't agree with his meaning and kept comforting Su Nantian.

"You are our great benefactor! Wang Li! Without you, we wouldn't know what to do in the future!"

At this moment, the village head also looked at Su Nantian with admiration. His words were all heartfelt.

Wang Shu then stepped forward and patted Su Nantian's shoulder: "Today's event, you did well. I also misunderstood you before."

Wang Shu affirmed Su Nantian's ability, knowing that Su Nantian had the capability to handle them.

"Thank you."

When Su Nantian heard that no one blamed him and instead thanked him, he felt moved. He touched his chest, feeling a warm current in his heart.

Then Su Nantian said to them: "Later, come together. I'll prepare some herbs for you. Your injuries can't be taken lightly."

Su Nantian remembered that they had been beaten many times by these henchmen. This must be carefully treated and not taken lightly.

"It's okay, okay. We're all tough-skinned."

The villagers waved their hands repeatedly, indicating that Su Nantian didn't need to be so worried: "We usually do heavy work, and after returning home, we're always sore. It's nothing, A Li, don't worry about us."

After the villagers told Su Nantian not to be worried about them, they again thanked him profusely. Overflowing praise came from their mouths.

Everyone was getting more and more fond of Su Nantian, and they also trusted him at this moment. They felt that with Su Nantian around, they could be more relaxed.

"From now on, with A Li here, we don't have to worry about these villains anymore! I'm sure they won't dare to do anything after this loss!"

The villagers were happy and discussed, chattering happily. Everyone's face was filled with smiles, as if it were a festival.

They had been oppressed by the villains for so long and were already very disgusted with them. Today, with Su Nantian's help, not only did they vent their anger but also ensured these villains would never dare to covet them again.

After thinking about this, the villagers of the small fishing village were even more delighted and longed to celebrate right away.

"It's okay. Even if they dare to come back, there's still me in the small fishing village. They won't dare to act recklessly."

When Su Nantian heard the villagers say this, he immediately made a promise.

Since it was him who had brought the trouble back, Su Nantian naturally wanted to protect them. As long as he was there one day, these villains would not come back.

Moreover, Su Nantian saw that they had been scared by him this time and would not dare to come back so quickly.

After thinking about it, Su Nantian's mood calmed down a lot and was no longer as worried.

The villagers had just witnessed Su Nantian's strength, so they naturally didn't doubt him. Everyone agreed with what Su Nantian said and nodded in agreement, completely believing that Su Nantian was right.

After returning, the villains indeed were scared by Su Nantian's prediction and dared not come back to the small fishing village for a short time. They also dared not trouble Su Nantian and these villagers.

After all, the people they had sent were professionals, but they could not fight Su Nantian at all. Not only that, but they were completely controlled by him, as if he was playing with them.

After thinking about this, the villains were even more angry but dared not speak out. They also didn't dare to come back recklessly into the small fishing village.

They were only worried about angering Su Nantian again and ending up like Ahao.

After thinking of how Ahao was sent to the hospital in a hurry, and the doctor said his hand would be useless forever, that this finger could never be used again, and there was no possibility of recovery, everyone became even more wary of Su Nantian. They dared not provoke him easily.

Moreover, they had all seen Su Nantian's strength and suffered his losses. These people also thought about going to other villages instead of coming to the small fishing village in the future, just to find trouble.

But Ahao, after returning home and hearing from his family that his hand had been ruined by Su Nantian, could not hide his anger. His hatred grew endlessly.

"Wang Li!"

Ahao clenched his right hand and gritted his teeth, shouting Su Nantian's name.

He was extremely angry. Thinking about how he was young and had to bear this lifelong injury because of Su Nantian, he hated Su Nantian deeply.

People like Ahao would never reflect on their own problems. If he truly had the will to reflect, he wouldn't have bullied those villagers without background and resources.

He had truly deserved this punishment.

Chapter 791: Revenge

But Ahao still blamed Su Nantian for all the mistakes, thinking that if it weren't for Su Nantian ruining him, he wouldn't have ended up in this situation.

"Damn it! You're a scoundrel!"

Ahao was angry and kept cursing, venting his inner frustration.

Unfortunately, he had no ability like Su Nantian. Especially after seeing the strange power that Su Nantian displayed, Ahao's hostility towards Su Nantian deepened.

"Ahao, why did you come down? You should go back to bed and rest. The doctor said you need to stay in bed."

At this moment, Ahao's parents came in. They looked at Ahao with concern and advised him worriedly.

Ahao, however, sneered and didn't take their words seriously. He angrily said: "Rest? My hand is already ruined! Do you think I have the will to rest?"

After thinking about this, Ahao pushed everything on the bedside table to the ground.

The scattered items on it were all thrown to the ground by Ahao's fierce swing. The lamp even shattered into pieces, no longer resembling its original form.

"Ah, what are you doing, child? Don't take your anger out on these things! Be careful not to hurt yourself!"

Ahao's mother quickly looked at Ahao with concern and gently advised him, worrying about his safety.

"Injury? I'm already disabled. What deeper injury could there be!"

At this moment, Ahao sneered and said these words with a face full of contempt.

He was not a good person to begin with. After knowing that his hand had been ruined by Su Nantian, he completely turned into a sinister person. His whole self was no longer himself.

After hearing Ahao say this, his parents felt even more heartbroken. However, they were also worried that Ahao's excitement would hurt himself and advised him.

"Ahao, don't think about this anymore. We've heard from your friend what really happened. It was their fault, and secondly, that person didn't know his limits. We couldn't fight him. You should just be quiet and take care of your injuries. I'll send you abroad for treatment later."

Ahao's father directly instructed, and it was decided in one go. He didn't care about Ahao's current feelings or give him any chance to refuse.

When Ahao heard his father say this, the expression on his face became even more unpleasant. He had thought that his parents would find someone to teach Su Nantian a lesson, even if they didn't have the ability. At least, they would make a show.

But instead, they immediately told him to let it go.

This was his hand, not someone else's! They spoke so lightly, but what about himself? What kind of pain would he have to endure in the future?

Thinking about this, Ahao's face became even more unpleasant. He also hated his parents at the same time.

Ahao's parents saw him become silent and didn't know what he was thinking. They thought Ahao had taken their words to heart. After exchanging glances, they said that he should rest well and then left without disturbing him anymore.

They didn't know that as soon as they left, Ahao turned around and smashed everything in the room he could. His actions were very fierce, showing his intense hatred.

"Wang Li! You wait for me. I won't let you go so easily!"

He couldn't swallow this anger. Although he couldn't fight Su Nantian now, Ahao swore that one day he would deal with Su Nantian and take back the injury he had suffered in full.

Moreover, he would completely destroy that annoying small fishing village! Let them regret their actions today.

After being disciplined by Su Nantian, these villains and henchmen also became more subdued. The villagers noticed that they hadn't seen the villains for a while.

These villains dared not appear anymore, and they also didnâ€™t dare to collect protection money from the villagers. They were afraid of being seen by Su Nantian and getting punished again.

Life gradually returned to normal, as if these arrogant people had never existed.

Su Nantian continued his peaceful life in the small fishing village, but he didn't know that while it was calm inside the village, the outside world wasn't so quiet or simple.

Indeed, the Xu family had already taken action. They recently found new progress.

"Mother."

Xu Hai hurriedly stepped in, greeted his mother first, and then reported about Su Nantian.

"Has this matter made progress?"

Madam Xu looked at the documents and, upon hearing Xu Hai's words, raised her head to look at him seriously.

"Yes! Mother! There have been discoveries."

Xu Hai nodded immediately, not hiding anything from Madam Xu.

"Quickly tell me what progress has been made."

She had previously ordered Xu Hai to find information about Su Nantian, but this news was like a stone sinking into the sea and had no effect. However, Madam Xu believed in her son's ability and didn't want to pressure him too much. Therefore, she hadnâ€™t paid much attention to this matter.

After a few days, seeing him come to her on his own and saying he had made progress, Madam Xu was immediately anxious and asked. She even stopped looking at the documents.

"Mother, don't be in a hurry. Let me explain it to you carefully."

Xu Hai quickly answered Madam Xu and didn't keep her waiting.

He told Madam Xu everything he had found out. After finishing, he looked up at her and waited for her instructions.

"Ah, so the Lotus Lake is actually connected to a living water source. That means it's connected with the outside."

Madam Xu thought for a while and then spoke softly, analyzing.

After saying this, Madam Xu suddenly smiled slightly. Her eyes also became more sharp.

"Hmph, so it's true. It seems that Su Nantian is indeed alive."

After thinking about this, Madam Xu smiled again. The curve of her lips was even more obvious.

She had thought this from the beginning. How could someone as powerful as Su Nantian die so simply and so humbly? To be drowned in the Lotus Lake like that was too ridiculous.

If this were true, Su Nantian wouldn't have wasted so much effort on Madam Xu.

Chapter 792: Continuing the Investigation

Now it turned out that the Lotus Lake was indeed connected to a living water source. And after so long, they hadn't found his body.

This proved that Su Nantian was truly alive and had evaded their sight.

After thinking about this, Madam Xu asked Xu Hai again: "Other than this news, is there anything else important?"

After saying that, Madam Xu waited for Xu Hai's answer.

"Not yet, Mother."

Xu Hai slowly shook his head and answered truthfully without hiding anything from Madam Xu.

His every answer was in line with the facts, no embellishment or seeking praise from Madam Xu.

"We have only confirmed that the Lotus Lake of Wu Family is connected to a living water source. We've also identified several major rivers, but we haven't found where this living water connects to yet."

Xu Hai continued reporting to Madam Xu.

After saying that, he apologized to Madam Xu: "It's my fault. I've only found a little information after so many days, and it has disappointed you."

His tone was slow, fearing that Madam Xu would blame him for being ineffective.

Unexpectedly, Madam Xu was very understanding after hearing his explanation.

Madam Xu paused for a moment and then continued to speak to Xu Hai: "Then proceed carefully. Don't miss any clues."

Madam Xu knew that it was difficult to find such a large place, especially since Su Nantian had blended into the crowd. It was like finding one star among countless stars in the sky, which wasn't easy at all.

Moreover, facing Su Nantian as a prey, Madam Xu had never felt such excitement before. She hadn't felt this way in years and hadnâ€™t been challenged by anyone else, so she had plenty of patience to play with Su Nantian.

Therefore, Madam Xu gave Xu Hai more time and was more tolerant of him.

Madam Xu didn't even scold Xu Hai for his slow actions but instead comforted him.

After comforting Xu Hai, Madam Xu directly pointed out a direction for him to make it easier and faster to find Su Nantian.

"Ahai, first send a few teams along each river you discovered to investigate. These places are small towns, and new faces would be easily noticed. If Su Nantian appears there, he definitely wouldn't escape the eyes of the people living there."

Madam Xu thought clearly and had accumulated countless experiences over the years. Her words alone were enough for young people to learn from.

When Xu Hai heard Madam Xu say this, he had no objections and nodded repeatedly to show that he understood.

"Remember, this matter must be handled carefully but not rushed. Don't scare the grass, or Su Nantian will become cautious once he discovers our movements."

It would be even harder to find him then.

Madam Xu nodded in satisfaction after seeing Xu Hai's attitude and added a reminder.

At this moment, she knew that Su Nantian hadn't discovered the presence of the Xu family and didnâ€™t know about their connection with Wu Chuan. Therefore, Madam Xu was very confident in sending her people to investigate.

But Su Nantian was such a smart person. If he had no means, how could he have survived so well here?

That's why Madam Xu added a reminder to her son, telling him to be careful with Su Nantian and not to be careless, or it would lead to a disaster.

One mistake could ruin everything.

"Mother, rest assured. I understand."

Xu Hai respectfully replied and had no intention of arguing.

Seeing Xu Hai's respectful attitude and how he always respected her, Madam Xu felt better. She nodded in satisfaction.

After discussing Su Nantian's matter, Madam Xu turned her attention to other matters.

She waved her hand and signaled Xu Hai to sit down first, then asked: "What progress has been made on Lu Hong's side?"

Lu Hong naturally referred to Old Hong.

Madam Xu asked this question, which also showed that she had a firm grip on the entire Xu family and didn't miss any details.

It also proved that Madam Xu had known about Xu Xiangning's actions all along and had already known she went to seek help from Old Hong.

That was why Madam Xu asked this question now.

Madam Xu didn't stop her daughter from contacting Old Hong because she knew Old Hong wouldnâ€™t harm Xu Xiangning.

Secondly, Madam Xu was familiar with this situation and knew that having another path meant more convenience. Perhaps they could also monitor Old Hong to find the clues he discovered.

This would improve efficiency and make things easier.

Otherwise, with Madam Xu's personality, how could she ignore this matter?

When Xu Hai heard his mother say this, he didn't hide anything and quickly told her everything he knew.

"Mother, rest assured. Since my sister went to see Lu Hong, I have already sent people secretly following him and been monitoring his men all the time."

Xu Hai had prepared a few plans in advance. He always had responses for any situation.

"However, Old Hong's findings are similar to ours. He also just learned about the Lotus Lake connected to a living water source in Wu Family and found several villages similar to ours."

Xu Hai told Madam Xu all the information, then said: "Mother, rest assured. My people are watching over her, and he won't dare to move against my sister."

After hearing that even Old Hong hadnâ€™t found any useful clues, Madam Xu was uninterested and didn't ask about Old Hong anymore.

But when she mentioned Xu Xiangning, Madam Xu felt regretful.

"She really doesn't know how many more losses she'll have to endure before returning to her senses."

Thinking about this, Madam Xu recalled Xu Xiangning's rebelliousness when she was young. She had caused her a lot of trouble.

Xu Hai, hearing Madam Xu say this, quietly reminded: "Then Mother, should I interfere to prevent my sister from going to see Old Hong?"

People who lived in the Xu family were all smart, especially Xu Hai. They had been living under Madam Xu's eyes every day and were naturally clever.

Everyone just followed the principle of speaking less and doing more.

Chapter 793: Proceeding with Caution

They had already known about Xu Xiangning and Old Hong's situation, but since Madam Xu hadn't given the order, they just pretended not to notice and turned a blind eye. They all acted as if nothing had happened.

Only Xu Xiangning, who was so foolish, believed that she had done everything perfectly and no one noticed her strange behavior.

After thinking about this, Xu Hai asked Madam Xu again: "Mother, do you need me to intervene and stop my sister from acting recklessly?"

Madam Xu just waved her hand, indicating it wasn't necessary. Then she said: "Leave it for now. As long as the Xu family doesnâ€™t fall, Old Hong won't dare to touch a single finger of her. Let her go and cause trouble."

After saying this, Madam Xu took her eyes off the matter and waved her hand again. She felt tired and rubbed her temples.

Then she ordered Xu Hai: "If there's nothing else, you can go and rest."

Seeing Madam Xuâ€™s tired look, Xu Hai naturally knew she wanted to rest. He didnâ€™t stay foolishly but quickly found an excuse to leave and went out.

When Xu Hai left, Madam Xu again raised her hand to massage her temples.

Thinking about the vast affairs of the Xu family and the people with ambitions underneath, Madam Xu felt she had a lot to worry about. She feared she would have to stay in this position until death.

The Xu family had their own problems and things they needed to worry about. Most of their attention was on investigating Su Nantian, so they hadnâ€™t had the time to punish the Nan Gong family who had helped Su Nantian before.

However, the Xu family only let the Nan Gong family have a short break and hadnâ€™t taken action against them.

Even though Madam Xu couldn't take action against the Nan Gong family, they were already preoccupied with their own problems. They had encountered a series of strange misfortunes and their development was getting worse.

The Nan Gong family had lost the wetland bidding, so they chose another piece of land to develop. However, they seemed to have been cursed by a broom star and failed at everything they did. They had almost gotten into trouble.

This land hadn't even been developed yet, and the Nan Gong family was already in deep water. They were caught up in various troubles.

Moreover, recent problems with the port's goods had occurred. It was well arranged before, but when it came to shipping, a sudden inspection took all their goods.

The Nan Gong family had deep roots in the inland port. However, they dared not fight against those above them. They could only swallow this silent loss.

Thinking about recent troubles, the Nan Gong family was almost driven mad.

The Nan Gong family had also fallen into gloom, with no clear day.

Especially for Nan Gong Lin, who was in a high position. His health wasn't good at all. He had only stayed because he listened to Su Nantian's advice and wanted to stabilize the Nan Gong familyâ€™s position in the inland port. He hadnâ€™t stepped down, and he occasionally went out to appear, proving his health condition.

But recently, too many troubling matters had piled up on Nan Gong Lin's head. He was overworked and his health was deteriorating.

Even during meetings with Nan Gong Yu Yan, he often coughed continuously.

Nan Gong Yu Yan and Nan Gong Ping had also noticed this issue. However, they were all dismissed by Nan Gong Lin with excuses like seasonal changes and a simple cold.

In fact, only Nan Gong Lin knew that his frail body might not last long.

"Father, who is it that dares to target our Nan Gong family?"

This time, the opponent's intention was clear and they had come with great force. They hadn't given the Nan Gong family any time to prepare, so Nan Gong Yu Yan and others naturally felt that the opponent was not good.

Seeing their father's weak condition, they were very worried. However, after hearing Nan Gong Linâ€™s explanation, they felt a little relieved and chose to believe him.

Moreover, there were more pressing matters now. So Nan Gong Yu Yan didnâ€™t have much time to investigate the truth of what Nan Gong Lin said. Also, she believed her father wouldnâ€™t deceive her.

So they quickly refocused their attention on the matters they needed to discuss today.

When Nan Gong Ping heard Nan Gong Yu Yan say this, he immediately added: "Yes, Father. Who is it that's causing trouble? Not only did they interfere with our plans but even those agreements we had already made were interrupted. They destroyed the contracts."

Nan Gong Ping felt more and more that something was wrong, and he also thought they had been targeted by someone.

Thinking about these troubles, Nan Gong Yu Yan and Nan Gong Lin both looked worried and couldn't handle it.

If one incident was a coincidence, two incidents were just luck. But what about three or four?

Nan Gong Yu Yan and others didnâ€™t believe in such coincidences. Even if there were, they couldn't have happened so quickly within their family.

That was too strange and hard to believe.

"It's definitely someone who has targeted us."

Nan Gong Lin coughed lightly and then thought for a while before answering his two children's questions: "If it weren't someone targeting us, how could they always interfere with our Nan Gong family's matters?"

Nan Gong Lin continued to speak, his expression was very serious.

He had been in this position for many years and had seen a lot of strategies. At first, he hadn't noticed it, but gradually, Nan Gong Lin had discovered the hidden problems.

Moreover, when he felt something was wrong, he immediately sent people to investigate. He hadnâ€™t been idle and had received no ideal feedback. He hadn't found out who was targeting them.

This person's methods were excellent and very hidden. They could easily cover up their actions, as if there was an invisible hand constantly manipulating the Nan Gong family.

"What about you, Father? Have you found out who this person is?"

Nan Gong Ping asked anxiously at this moment, desperately wanting to know the answer.

Nan Gong Lin slowly shook his head. His words and expressions clearly told Nan Gong Ping that this matter had failed.

Nan Gong Yu Yan guessed the answer from her father's expression and didnâ€™t ask. Her face also became worried.

Chapter 794: Targeting the Nan Gong Family

"Father?"

Nan Gong Ping asked again, questioning Nan Gong Lin.

After Nan Gong Ping said this and saw the change in his father's eyes, Nan Gong Yu Yan was even more certain of her guess.

"No. There has been no progress so far."

Nan Gong Lin didnâ€™t hide this from his two children. Especially after he felt his health was deteriorating recently, he wanted to pass on some useful methods to them while he was still alive so they could avoid mistakes in the future.

So, he answered them in detail now.

"Their methods are too excellent and very hidden. We havenâ€™t found anything so far."

Nan Gong Lin continued to speak: "The only thing we can confirm is that they have been targeting our Nan Gong family. They probably have more tricks up their sleeve."

After saying this, seeing the worried expression on Nan Gong Ping's face, Nan Gong Lin added a comforting statement: "But you can rest assured. As long as they come to act, there will definitely be a flaw."

After all, anyone doing something couldn't be perfect. They would surely find the opponent's flaw.

Also thinking about this, Nan Gong Lin had already secretly ordered people to be on high alert in all directions. They would immediately report any discoveries.

"Okay, you don't need to worry so much."

Nan Gong Lin spoke gently again and reassured them, telling them to calm down and not be so worried.

"But Father..."

Nan Gong Ping heard his father say this, but he still had many concerns and worries. Naturally, he wanted to ask further questions.
