Su Nantian knew their intentions, but at that moment, he merely let out a cold laugh.
Doubt their own abilities?
Then they would soon realize how narrow-minded they were, and how shallow.
Su Nantian would also show them the severity of their mistake.
Thus, at that moment Su Nantian did not intervene to stop them, but merely watched with a cold gaze.
Yet after Achuan fired his gun, he raised his hand again and successfully deflected the bullet once more.
The bullet was as before, seemingly encountering an invisible barrier in midair, making it impossible to reach the villagers of Xiaoyu.
This left not only Long Ge and Achuan utterly stunned, but even the villagers of Xiaoyu were bewildered, staring at Su Nantian in disbelief.
Clearly, none of them had anticipated that Su Nantian possessed such power.
This was beyond the capabilities of any ordinary person; he had intercepted a bullet from such a distance, an act that defied all expectations.
After this realization, the villagers of Xiaoyu felt no fear but instead a profound sense of relief.
They now believed that as long as Su Nantian was present, these people would dare not harm them.
Though they did not know why these people had called Su Nantian by his name, their hearts inclined more towards Uncle Wang and trusted Su Nantian, who had spent so many days with them.
Moreover, they knew that Su Nantian's arrival had brought them great progress; thus, all of them unconditionally trusted him.
Even if he had done something wrong, they would unquestionably stand by his side.

Chapter 829: Unusual
Not to mention these people had come seeking trouble and injured the villagers of Xiaoyu.
"Long Ge! This guy isn’t an ordinary person!"
At this moment, Achuan regained his voice amidst his shock. His face was pale, a pallor that could not be concealed even in the darkness.
He trembled as he spoke to Long Ge, hoping for a solution.
"What ordinary person? Isn’t he just two eyes and a nose? Could he have three heads and six arms, or even transcend the heavens?"
Long Ge was equally panicked. He had underestimated Su Nantian’s abilities and failed to anticipate how formidable he was.
Moreover, they had no idea that all of Su Nantian’s actions in the surveillance footage were genuine abilities, not mere coincidence.
What other powers did he possess that they had yet to discover?
The thought made Long Ge and Achuan instinctively step back, as did their men, who stared at Su Nantian with the eyes of beasts. None could accept that Su Nantian was merely an ordinary person.
Among them, Ahao was the most terrified. He thought of all their past grudges and how these people had come with him.
If Su Nantian decided to settle accounts, he would not live through it!
The thought made Ahao shudder uncontrollably. His shoulders trembled constantly.
At this moment, he had forgotten how to speak, unable to utter a single sound.
Ahao felt as if he were trapped in an ice cellar, buried alive by blocks of ice. His limbs were cold and lifeless; he had no idea how to face Su Nantian.
At this moment, Ahao realized that even prayer was futile—he should never have offended Su Nantian, this harbinger of doom.
He should have known Su Nantian’s methods were unlike those of ordinary people when he had first confronted him. Yet he had refused to believe in fate!
Even after Su Nantian had crippled one of his arms, he still refused to abandon his desire for revenge.
Now, Su Nantian was far more powerful than he had imagined.
And it seemed Su Nantian would not let any of them leave alive today.
"I..."
The thought made Ahao even more terrified. His fear and regret were overwhelming; he wondered why he had been so foolish as to oppose Su Nantian.
Su Nantian had already shown mercy before, sparing him, yet he still refused to let go of his grudge and had come seeking revenge.
Now, Ahao feared he would not survive the night in Xiaoyu.
The thought made his heart lurch, as if struck by a heavy hammer, leaving him without the familiar sense of life.
Long Ge and Achuan kept retreating, as did Ahao, though his limbs felt numb. Each step he took drained all his strength.
Moreover, he was drenched in sweat; the back of his clothes were soaked and clung to his skin, making him uncomfortable.
But Ahao had no time to care about such details now; he could not even guarantee his survival, let alone worry about anything else.
"Hmph."
Su Nantian had not missed their fear and unease. At this moment, he let out another cold laugh, his gaze even colder. He swept over them with a voice as calm as ever: "Now you know fear, don’t you?"
They were all the same—cowardly and submissive. They had the same flaw of not learning until it was too late.
The one who had previously provoked Su Nantian, Ahao, was no different; when Su Nantian had not revealed his power yet, they had threatened him relentlessly and treated the villagers of Xiaoyu as mere pawns to use against him.
Now, after realizing his abilities, they had all retreated in fear, proving themselves cowards.
As Su Nantian thought this through, his lips curled into a colder smile. His gaze was like ice, making anyone who met it shudder uncontrollably and unable to stand upright.
At this moment, Su Nantian suddenly felt a sharp pain in his head.
He had experienced such pain before when he had disciplined Ahao.
He also felt that this scene was oddly familiar, as if he had spoken similar words and done similar things before. He recalled having confronted people like these, who had also been as insufferable as Long Ge and Achuan.
After this thought, Su Nantian furrowed his brows again, his expression now tinged with pain.
Long Ge and Achuan watched Su Nantian’s expressions closely. Upon seeing his expression and the look of pain on his face, they exchanged a quick glance.
"Long Ge, this is a good opportunity!"
Achuan spoke excitedly at this moment. They had thought they would surely fall to Su Nantian’s hands, but now it seemed he was facing some problem.
Long Ge and Achuan shared the same thought; of course, he was also worried about their escape. Upon seeing Su Nantian apparently suffering from a recurrence of his condition, he nodded immediately and then exchanged a glance with Achuan before both opened fire at Su Nantian.
No matter who he was, they would kill him first and take his corpse back to fulfill Hongye’s demand.
They had already witnessed Su Nantian’s strength and knew that unless it was a special situation, they could not subdue him.
As the saying goes, take advantage of his illness to end his life; one must act swiftly when he is weak!
That was their plan. After exchanging a glance with Achuan, they understood each other’s intent and both pulled the trigger, intending to kill Su Nantian when he was unprepared.
Once they eliminated this threat, the villagers of Xiaoyu would be no match for them; they could deal with them easily.
Their plan was excellent and they had hoped it would not be discovered by Su Nantian, but Long Ge and Achuan did not know that Su Nantian had already noticed their movements.
Seeing Long Ge and Achuan’s actions, the other subordinates slightly relaxed their concern, no longer as tense as before.

Chapter 830: Supernatural Ability
Ahao should have also felt relieved, but for some reason, his heart was restless and he could not relax or fully let go of his worries.
Soon, Ahao understood why his heart felt so uneasy: because Long Ge and Achuan were no match for Su Nantian.
Even though Su Nantian was in pain and his mind seemed to replay fragmented images like a rollercoaster, he could still see their movements and anticipate their next steps.
As they fired, Su Nantian raised his hand immediately, just as before; an invisible barrier seemed to block all the bullets.
These bullets met the same fate as those before, none approaching Su Nantian even halfway, all intercepted without exception.
"Shh—!"
Long Ge and Achuan both inhaled sharply, their expressions completely out of their expectations. They had thought Su Nantian was too preoccupied to notice them and that he would have no defense.
But clearly, their estimation was wrong; Su Nantian had not only seen their movements but also intercepted their ambush, leaving them with no success.
After this thought, Long Ge and Achuan’s faces changed again, unable to accept the current situation.
How could Su Nantian still see their movements and intercept them, even though he had just started to lose focus and seemed to be suffering some pain?
This thought made Achuan and Long Ge look even more grim. Their hearts felt as if they had a huge stone tied to them, sinking again and again.
No one could know the depth of despair in Achuan and Long Ge’s hearts at this moment.
They even felt immense regret; if they had known Su Nantian was so powerful and beyond their imagination, they would not have come so hastily.
Long Ge now began to regret; he thought he should have listened to Achuan’s advice and returned to report to Hongye first, waiting for Hongye to gather enough men before confirming whether they were the ones they sought.
Then they would not have had to risk their lives here!
But no matter how much they regretted it now, or how frustrated they felt, the situation was already decided. It was too late to change anything; they had already angered Su Nantian.
As for whether they could survive, it depended on Su Nantian’s mood and what they did next.
As the saying goes, some are happy while others are sad. Long Ge and Achuan were now in a panic, like ants on a hot pan; even Ahao felt they were doomed.
But the villagers of Xiaoyu were incredibly happy.
They had known that as long as Su Nantian appeared, he would save them; they also knew Su Nantian was capable of such feats, beyond the reach of ordinary people.
While Long Ge and Achuan were filled with regret and resentment for having provoked Su Nantian, and for coming to Xiaoyu tonight, the villagers of Xiaoyu felt immense relief.
Compared to their varied emotions, Su Nantian remained remarkably calm.
Though he did not remember his past actions, he vaguely knew his personality and that he was a person who kept to himself.
Su Nantian’s usual approach was: if others did not provoke him, he would not retaliate. But if they did, he would never let it go.
Like now, they had already come to provoke him and had even arrived at his doorstep; Su Nantian would certainly not let them off.
Moreover, he knew that if it were not for his abilities surpassing their expectations, they would have been even more ruthless tonight.
And now that they had tied up the villagers of Xiaoyu, Su Nantian would certainly not let them go.
"This is a misunderstanding!"
At this moment, Long Ge’s eyes darted around, as if thinking of something. Suddenly, he had an idea and came up with an excuse.
Long Ge was only thinking of using this opportunity to escape, then returning for reinforcements before confronting Su Nantian.
But he had failed to anticipate Su Nantian’s character, and how could he be so easily deceived?
"misunderstanding?"
Su Nantian raised an eyebrow and asked softly.
His expression was calm, with no obvious emotions; thus, one could not discern his mood at that moment.
Long Ge could not determine Su Nantian’s feelings, so he did not know what to say next.
"I don’t think it is a misunderstanding," Su Nantian continued, his voice still calm and emotionless.
"But your people have already tied them up, and they injured my people."
This statement clearly accused Long Ge and his men. They had seen Su Nantian’s performance, so they knew he was not someone who would easily let go.
Long Ge quickly interjected: "It really is a misunderstanding."
After saying this, he also feared Su Nantian would be angry at his actions and hurriedly ordered the others: "Hurry up, let them go! It’s really a misunderstanding!"
Long Ge said this while smiling lightly, as if to ease the awkward atmosphere.
After he finished speaking, he added: "We mistakenly identified someone at first; you know we came here to find a man named Su Nantian, but you are Wang Li. It must be a mistake."
Achuan had not understood why Long Ge suddenly changed sides and started to flatter Su Nantian, but after hearing this excuse, he quickly caught on.
He nodded vigorously and immediately supported Long Ge’s words: "Yes! That's it, we made a mistake."
"I see. These villagers call you Wang Li, so you must not be the one we are looking for!"
After saying this, Achuan also hurriedly helped others to release the villagers.
They had previously threatened these villagers with a fierce demeanor, but now they spoke kindly, fearing to offend them and let Su Nantian curse them.
Their attitude was completely opposite; within a short time, they seemed to have become different people, which was quite amusing.
Though the villagers were released, they did not fully forgive Long Ge and his men; they still glared at them coldly without saying a word.
Moreover, the villagers wished to scold Long Ge and his men alongside Su Nantian.

Chapter 831: Coercion
"Hmph!"
Chen Xiaoling immediately let out a cold snort, then scolded Achuan with an air of superiority: "You caused such a commotion tonight, and now one excuse about mistaking identities is enough to let it go? I think you are just scared of Li Ge’s strength, so you dare not act anymore!"
After saying this, Chen Xiaoling quickly went to check on Xiao Chen’s wound.
"Brother, are you okay?"
Thinking of how these people had shot at Xiao Chen and kicked him, Chen Xiaoling felt furious. Even if they truly had mistaken identities, she would never forgive them.
The other villagers also shared Chen Xiaoling’s attitude; they would not forgive Long Ge and his men.
At this moment, they all spoke coldly to Long Ge and his men, glaring at them without giving them any good looks or saying a single word in their favor.
However, Long Ge was only thinking of escaping quickly to report back to Hongye and then return with reinforcements to deal with them properly.
As for now, Long Ge was willing to yield and only wanted to leave this place safely.
"Sorry, sorry! It was our mistake; we are willing to compensate and apologize."
At this moment, Long Ge quickly apologized. Then he said to Su Nantian: "But we just mistook identities, which is understandable. We hope you can be magnanimous and not hold it against us."
"Mistook identities?"
At this moment, Su Nantian continued speaking. His expression remained very cold, and his voice had no change.
If others thought Su Nantian was Wang Li, but Su Nantian himself knew he was Su Nantian. That meant he had always been the person Long Ge and his men were looking for.
"If I say, I am Su Nantian, and you did not mistake identities?"
At this moment, Su Nantian took a step forward, coldly staring at Long Ge and his men.
Compared to their previous arrogance, they now looked like frightened hens, all very fearful of Su Nantian.
At this moment, Long Ge and his men were like wilted eggplants or people hit by frost; they could no longer be bold.
Upon hearing Su Nantian’s words, Long Ge and his men inhaled sharply again.
They had thought their excuse would be enough to get by, but they did not expect Su Nantian to refuse to let them off.
"This... this can't be right! You are not Wang Li? The villagers also call you Wang Li. It must be a mistake, a misidentification!"
Long Ge’s forehead broke out in cold sweat. At this moment, he was still trying to stay calm and insisted on his claim.
He looked at the other villagers, as if seeking their support.
The villagers did not know why Su Nantian had admitted to this name, but they knew they were on the same side as Su Nantian. How could they help Long Ge and his men?
So when Long Ge sought their support, the villagers all turned away, not looking at Long Ge even once or giving him any extra glance.
"Speak up. What did you come for? Who sent you?"
The situation had completely reversed; Long Ge and his men were no longer coming to trouble Su Nantian.
Instead, they seemed like captured prisoners being interrogated under duress, now required to confess everything.
Su Nantian spoke coldly. After saying this, his palm suddenly opened toward Long Ge and his men, and he took all their guns.
If Long Ge and his men had felt some relief or calmness when they saw Su Nantian deflect the bullets, now they were all completely shocked and stunned.
They had never imagined Su Nantian could do this; he had simply stretched out his hand, and their guns seemed to have a life of their own, all moving toward Su Nantian.
This made Long Ge and his men extremely terrified.
They completely believed that no one in the world had such abilities.
In fact, Su Nantian had just been testing it; these days he had been absorbing the essence of the sun and moon, and felt that his body was being nourished in this remote village.
Even now he did not need to sleep; just by meditating for two or three hours, he could restore his energy. He felt more energetic than others who had slept for a day.
Moreover, Su Nantian never felt tired; he was energetic all day long, twenty-four hours a day.
This action had also been to test whether he had this ability; it turned out that it was successful.
Even Su Nantian did not know how he had done this action; he felt that he was merging with the surrounding air. It was just a thought in his mind, and those guns had already been taken from them.
"Speak up. Answer every one of my questions, or you know I have no patience."
But since this action had been successfully completed and they were sufficiently frightened, Su Nantian naturally controlled his expression and maintained the same calm demeanor.
When he spoke this sentence, he was also casually playing with the guns in his hands.
When he mentioned his impatience, Su Nantian’s fingers suddenly clenched into a fist. At this moment, the pile of guns on the ground were all controlled by an invisible force and twisted into various shapes.
These deadly guns had now become a pile of scrap metal, completely useless.
Long Ge and his men had already been terrified enough before; now they were even more nervous and fearful.
They all inhaled sharply again. If they had been trembling before, now they were shaking like a sieve. They felt as if they had been thrown into the depths of winter, wearing only short sleeves and shorts.
A cold chill ran up their spines, making them feel as if they were frozen to the bone with no place to escape.
"Speak up."
At this moment, Su Nantian spoke again in a calm tone. He did not repeat his previous questions but simply said these two words, then casually watched Long Ge and his men, waiting for their answers.
Though Su Nantian was just standing there, the intimidation he exuded was immense.

Chapter 832: Following Orders
Long Ge and his men had barely managed to stand before, but now their legs were so weak they fell to their knees in front of Su Nantian.
"We just followed orders! This has nothing to do with us. Please spare our lives; we were blind and didn’t recognize the great mountain before us, and we offended you!"
At this moment, Long Ge trembled all over and stammered out these words with difficulty.
"We really realized our mistake; we didn’t mean to offend you! Please spare us!"
Long Ge quickly begged for mercy, as if he could not say anything else.
They had previously called Su Nantian "young man" and mocked him for overestimating himself!
Now they were terrified, using respectful terms instead. They addressed Su Nantian as "you" and even dared not use the word "you."
It was truly amusing.
"Following orders?"
At this moment, Su Nantian slowly raised his eyebrows and asked loudly: "Then who gave you the orders? Who sent you to find me?"
Su Nantian already knew that when he saw Ahao, he had guessed it was Ahao who led them to find him. But who was the mastermind behind this? Su Nantian did not know yet.
Long Ge and Achuan were now in their own trouble, and upon hearing Su Nantian’s question, they hoped Su Nantian would spare them. Thus, how could they not speak?
They immediately revealed Hongye behind them, so fast that even Hongye himself would not have expected it.
"It was Hongye! He ordered us to find you! We just followed the rules, and this has nothing to do with us!"
Long Ge and Achuan trembled again, begging for mercy constantly, hoping Su Nantian would not hold it against them.
"Hongye?"
After obtaining the answer he wanted, Su Nantian’s expression slightly softened.
But this person named Hongye was unknown to him; he searched his mind but found no recognition. He had no memory of this Hongye at all.
"Who did he send you to find me for?"
Since Su Nantian could not figure it out, he did not dwell on it but directly questioned Long Ge and his men for the answer.
Upon hearing Su Nantian’s question, Long Ge shook his head immediately.
"We don’t know! We are just underlings; we do as we’re told, and whatever the superiors say, we follow!"
After answering Su Nantian, Long Ge quickly added: "I’m not lying to you! I’ve told you everything. Hongye just ordered us to find you!"
Achuan and the others nodded quickly, supporting Long Ge’s words: "Truly! We don’t know. Hongye only sent us this photo and ordered us to find you, that’s all!"
After saying this, Achuan looked at Su Nantian earnestly, hoping he would believe them and spare their lives this time.
"Moreover, Hongye sent many teams to find you; we are just one of them!"
After thinking for a moment, Achuan added.
"Along this river?"
Upon hearing Achuan’s words, Su Nantian became more interested. He raised his eyebrows and continued to question: "Where exactly is this river?"
He felt that this was beyond his expectations and had already deviated from what he had imagined.
Was there something else happening outside that he did not know about?
"Exactly this river."
Upon hearing Su Nantian’s question, Achuan thought that the more he answered, the more likely Su Nantian would let them go.
Achuan eagerly replied to Su Nantian: "This river was selected among five rivers, and many small teams were dispatched to find you."
"Five rivers?"
Upon hearing this, Su Nantian’s confusion deepened.
But he connected it with what Uncle Wang had told him before; Uncle Wang and the others had taken him back after fishing on the river, which matched.
Could his amnesia and disappearance be related to these people? Otherwise, why would Hongye order them to search along the river?
It was clear that he had fallen into the river, so Hongye had targeted him specifically.
If this was true, then many of his questions would be resolved.
Su Nantian’s confusion could be clarified when he met Hongye.
At this thought, Su Nantian's expression slightly softened and he began to ponder other matters.
"Who is this Hongye? Where is he?"
Su Nantian did not waste time but directly questioned.
Since this person might know the truth about his identity, Su Nantian would not let it go.
He needed to find this person immediately and clarify who he was, as well as why he wanted him.
"This..."
Upon hearing this, Long Ge and Achuan exchanged a glance, as if confused by Su Nantian’s question.
They did not know why he suddenly asked this and seemed worried that telling him the answer would bring them trouble.
Upon seeing their actions, Su Nantian raised his eyebrows again and seemed amused. He then composed himself and looked at Long Ge and his men with a cold, half-smiling gaze before asking: "How come I can’t ask this question?"
"No, no."
Upon seeing Su Nantian’s gaze, Long Ge and Achuan felt a shiver in their hearts and quickly shook their heads: "Of course you can ask!"
They did not delay but wisely told Su Nantian everything, including Hongye’s identity and address.
They were afraid that if they spoke too slowly, it would anger Su Nantian and bring about their deaths.
At this point, Long Ge and Achuan had forgotten their initial confidence and the ambition they had before to capture Su Nantian and collect rewards from Hongye.
After witnessing Su Nantian’s strength, they realized how foolish and naive their previous actions had been. It was truly laughable.

Chapter 833: Hongye
Su Nantian had not acted immediately, perhaps just to see how much more embarrassment they could create!
After thinking this through, Long Ge and Achuan quickly wilted again, realizing how foolish it was to come looking for Su Nantian.
It was truly laughable!
After all, at this moment, they would never dare to provoke Su Nantian.
But it was too late now; there was no use in regret!
"Hongye’s势力 is vast, controlling the entire city of M and having connections with many officials. Even if you are so powerful, opposing Hongye might be difficult."
At this moment, Long Ge and his men thought for a while before telling Su Nantian everything they knew, as if trying to win his favor and have him spare them.
Upon hearing that Hongye was a local boss in city M, controlling some underground businesses, Su Nantian’s confusion deepened.
How could he have any connection with this person? And why did he want to capture him so much?
At this moment, Su Nantian felt countless questions.
But he quickly stopped thinking further. He thought that he would soon find Hongye, and then he could directly ask him about these questions instead of guessing them.
At this moment, Long Ge and Achuan felt the most anxious about their situation. They swallowed their saliva and hesitantly asked Su Nantian: "Since you now know everything we told you, can you..."
They paused at this point and then carefully continued: "spare us?"
To save their lives, they had no choice but to ask Su Nantian directly. After all, this was a matter of life and death; if they did not ask, their hearts would never be at peace.
Clearly, this question was of great concern to everyone. After Long Ge and his men asked it, Ahao and the remaining subordinates also raised their heads, looking at Su Nantian with eagerness and hope.
Each person’s eyes were filled with expectation and anticipation, as if they all desperately hoped Su Nantian would show mercy and spare them.
"Spare you?"
At this moment, Su Nantian spoke softly and asked in return. His expression was slightly amused.
He felt that their question was too naive.
"Think carefully about your actions; now you still dare to hope I will spare you?"
At this point, Su Nantian felt like laughing. How bold were these people to have such a silly idea?
The victor is the king, and the defeated are the subjects. They were his subordinates after all; how could they dare to ask for mercy?
Moreover, they had injured the villagers of Xiaoyu and tied them up, threatening him. These actions alone would not allow him to forgive them.
Especially Ahao, who had repeatedly provoked him; Su Nantian had already warned him before. But he had let him go three times, and this time Su Nantian would not be lenient.
"What do you want to do with us?"
Upon hearing Su Nantian’s words, Long Ge's heart jumped again. His unease was spreading rapidly; his body trembled uncontrollably.
The others were the same, filled with fear. They did not even know what Su Nantian would do to them.
Would he kill them?
Upon thinking of this, Long Ge and his men shivered again. Their hearts jumped once more, as if pressed by a heavy stone, making it hard for them to breathe.
"Xiaoling, take the villagers back first."
At this moment, Su Nantian did not answer Long Ge and his men. He had no need to respond to them.
He turned to look at Chen Xiaoling and said: "Take them back to treat their wounds. Help bandage them, and I will come back later to remove the bullets."
They had already delayed too long; Xiao Chen and another villager were seriously injured, so they needed to stop the bleeding first.
Moreover, what was coming next was not suitable for these villagers to witness.
That was why Su Nantian had said this to Chen Xiaoling.
Upon hearing Su Nantian’s words, Chen Xiaoling was initially stunned before looking up at him.
Though Su Nantian did not say it explicitly, they all seemed to have guessed what Su Nantian would do next.
But they were all very tactful and did not ask further questions.
Especially Chen Xiaoling, who immediately nodded in agreement: "Okay, I’ll take them back to stop the bleeding. Li Ge, when you finish your work, come back and check on them again!"
Chen Xiaoling spoke politely to Su Nantian. The old village head and others had no objections; they all helped each other back to their houses, without asking Su Nantian how he planned to deal with these villains.
