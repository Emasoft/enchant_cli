He turned to Su Nantian and said, “Lige, let's just go back. It's not worth arguing with these people.”

After saying this, Xiao Chen cast a disdainful glance at Ahao and his gang.

Xiao Chen had now come to understand that he never wanted to become like Ahao. If he continued, he would be no different from them.

After clarifying his thoughts, Xiao Chen stopped bullying Ahao's group and realized that arguing with them was pointless.

Su Nantian had been silently observing the group all along.

When he heard Xiao Chen finally realize this, he gave him a satisfied glance.

He had originally intended to test Xiao Chen, seeing if he would become overconfident and continue bullying Ahao's group.

Unexpectedly, Xiao Chen had truly met his expectations—he had stopped in time and avoided any excessive actions.

After this, Su Nantian looked at Xiao Chen with even more respect and nodded, saying, “Yes, let's go back.”

They had wasted a lot of time already. Returning to the village would likely be at night.

Moreover, when Su Nantian had left, he had assumed they would only take a short time, so he hadn’t informed Uncle Wang.

But fate had proven otherwise; they had encountered too many unexpected obstacles along the way.

Returning now would be very late, and Uncle Wang’s group might have already returned from fishing. If they found him missing, they would surely be worried.

“Xiao Chen, let’s go back. Otherwise, the villagers will worry.”

After clarifying his thoughts, Su Nantian’s expression had grown urgent, urging Xiao Chen to hurry.

They quickly left, leaving the people in the alley—Ahao and the hooligans who had just been disciplined.

All of them watched Su Nantian leave and sighed in relief, looking like survivors of a near-death experience.

“God, I was scared to death!”

Some hooligans couldn’t help but speak out, patting their chests in fear.

“Ahao, are you okay?”

Now that the danger had passed, the hooligans resumed their familiar greetings.

“Smack!”

They were trying to flatter Ahao, but he suddenly grabbed their hands and pushed them away with a cold laugh, showing no mercy.

“Back when you shifted the blame, weren’t you so proud? Didn’t you say it was all my fault and had nothing to do with you? Now you’re trying to flatter me?”

Ahao said this, then let out a sinister laugh. He couldn’t take on Su Nantian, but could he not deal with these hooligans?

Moreover, he had clearly seen their selfishness when danger struck. How could he fall for their tricks again?

“Hey, no! Ahao, you’ve misunderstood us!”

The hooligans had spoken out in desperation, revealing their true thoughts.

After all, when danger came, protecting oneself was natural. They felt they had done nothing wrong.

But now that Ahao spoke like this, they knew he was determined to take them down.

They had just caught their breath, but now their hearts leapt again with anxiety. They were all wondering how Ahao would deal with them.

“Ahao, it’s really not like that! We thought you had a way out and said that!”

The hooligans quickly explained, begging: “Ahao, we were wrong! We’ll never do this again!”

They all apologized hurriedly, fearing Ahao would take revenge.

Moreover, the hooligans wore expressions of fear and had no good faces; they didn’t know how to handle Ahao.

They expected Ahao would scold them and were ready to swallow their saliva, prepared for his reprimand. But instead, Ahao only let out a cold laugh and didn’t confront them at all.

After that cold laugh, he turned around and left without another move.

The hooligans watched Ahao’s actions, confused. They looked at each other in bewilderment, unsure why he had suddenly left without scolding them.

Only Ahao knew he hadn’t truly let them off.

Ahao felt that now, alone and weak, staying to fight them was pointless; he might even be overpowered by their combined resistance. So he had left immediately.

But once he returned home, he would definitely find others to deal with them—no way would he let them continue their freedom.

“Hmph! Those who betray me will never have a good end!”

Ahao muttered angrily, his face filled with cruel determination.

“Phew! I was scared to death! I thought Ahao’s dark face meant he would really scold us!”

One hooligan sighed in relief and joked.

“Exactly! I thought I’d lose a layer of skin this time! But it turns out we were wrong about Ahao—he’s actually quite nice and didn’t scold us!”

Another hooligan added, patting his chest.

“Right, right! We’re lucky it turned out okay. Otherwise, I really would’ve been scared to death!”

The hooligans didn’t realize the danger they were in, thinking Ahao’s departure meant he had let them off. They all sighed in relief.

“Let’s celebrate! We’ve survived a big disaster and faced several dangers. Let’s go celebrate and wash away this bad luck!”

After saying that, the hooligans linked arms and left to celebrate, washing away their misfortune.

Ahao returned home with a grudge, planning to find people to deal with these hooligans.

As he thought about this, he didn’t notice the path ahead.

Without thinking, he collided head-on with someone coming from the opposite direction.

“Oof!”

The other person was extremely strong, and their muscles weren’t fake ones from protein powder.

Chapter 810: Provoking Danger

The other person’s muscles were solid, and they knocked Ahao to the ground instantly.

Ahao sat on the ground with a thud, first crying out in pain and then cursing angrily: “Who the hell is it? Which bastard has no eyes to bump into Grandpa!”

Ahao supported himself up, barely standing, and rubbed his sore spot. He hadn’t even seen who it was before shouting curses.

He had already been humiliated and insulted by Su Nantian and Xiao Chen, his mood was terrible. Now, on the way back home, he had been bumped into—how could he not be angry?

Ahao was furious and cursed the person with harsh words.

“Damn it!”

Ahao cursed again, not even thinking about who stood before him and kept cursing fiercely.

The other person had accidentally bumped into each other, it wasn’t entirely their fault. Originally, the man wanted to apologize and say sorry, ending the matter there.

But he hadn’t expected Ahao to dare curse him like that.

The man naturally couldn’t tolerate Ahao’s words and, upon hearing them, grabbed Ahao by the collar and lifted him effortlessly.

“Oof! Oof!”

The sudden feeling of being lifted off the ground startled Ahao, who cried out and looked up.

The man glared at Ahao angrily and demanded: “You little brat! Who said your eyes were blind? Calling me a bastard? Do you even know who I am? You dare call me a bastard?”

The man who grabbed Ahao’s collar was very strong, and his voice was full of energy. Behind him stood several men, each stronger than the last.

Moreover, these people had heard Ahao’s curses and all wore grim faces with fierce glares—clearly not easy to deal with.

Ahao hadn’t expected to offend these people. His heart skipped a beat, and he silently cursed himself for being so unlucky—out of the tiger’s mouth and into the wolf’s!

These people clearly weren’t easy to deal with. How had he been so careless and cursed these words?

Ahao was regretful beyond measure!

“Sorry, I’m sorry! Brothers! It’s my mistake. I was blind. I apologize! I am the bastard!”

Ahao turned pale and quickly apologized.

After all that had happened, Ahao had learned to submit quickly and knew that dignity was meaningless compared to his life.

If he continued arguing with them, it would only bring more trouble.

Moreover, these people looked strong enough to kill Ahao with one punch.

Ahao realized this and quickly submitted, saying nothing more.

“Hmph!”

The man heard Ahao’s quick apology and submission, his face slightly softened. But Ahao’s words had been too harsh for him to easily forgive.

“Apologize? You were wrong?”

He raised his fist, ready to punch Ahao.

But at that moment, someone beside him grabbed his hand and stopped his fist.

Then he spoke earnestly to the man: “Enough, Achuan. We have important matters this time; don’t act on impulse or cause more trouble.”

The person behind was likely their leader, and his words had some authority: “Since this guy has apologized, let’s leave it at that. Don’t make things worse.”

The man said this and gave Achuan a look, signaling him not to act.

“Ah,”

Achuan heard this and, although still reluctant, obeyed and slowly lowered his fist.

Ahao sighed in relief, happy to have escaped this disaster.

But Achuan had a bad habit; seeing Ahao relax and look relieved, he clenched his fist again.

“Yikes!”

Ahao gasped and cried out, closing his eyes immediately.

These people hadn’t said they wouldn’t fight, but why did they break the rules?

This was too terrifying!

“Achuan!”

The man hadn’t expected Achuan to change his mind, so he frowned and warned: “Achuan, you’re not going to do this again?”

Achuan scowled and stopped his fist just one centimeter from Ahao’s eyes: “Longge, I was just scaring him. I never planned to hit him!”

Achuan said this, then looked at Ahao with disdain. “Is he even a man? He was scared just by my fist!”

“Longge, you…”

Longge frowned but knew Achuan was like this—bad-tempered and hard to control. He had many opinions, but eventually swallowed his words and didn’t lecture him further.

“Understood! Longge, it’s just a person, I won’t act recklessly or ruin this mission.”

Achuan muttered in his heart and slowly lowered his fist. As he retracted it, he grumbled discontentedly, which was quite confrontational.

“Looking for someone?”

Ahao heard their conversation and suddenly thought of those words.

Seeing their demeanor, Ahao suddenly raised his head and said earnestly: “You’re looking for someone?”

But before he could finish, Achuan grabbed his neck.

“Who are you to meddle? Why did you get involved?”

Achuan fiercely grabbed Ahao’s neck and questioned him angrily.

“I…”

Ahao had wanted to make amends in front of them, but he hadn’t expected them to be so wary and hostile. He was grabbed by the neck immediately, scaring him greatly.

Moreover, they didn’t reduce their grip at all.

Ahao immediately felt his throat pain and turned red, starting to suffocate and feel dizzy.

“Achuan!”

At this moment, a shout came from the man who had previously stopped Achuan—Longge.

He directly scolded Achuan and then reached out to open his hand, making him release Ahao: “Achuan, have you forgotten my warning?”

Chapter 811: Discovering the Truth

“Why are you doing this? I told you not to cause trouble! If you kill him here, do you know how much trouble it would bring us?”

After scolding, Longge was angry at Achuan and upset that he hadn’t listened.

Ahao fell to the ground, his breath returning.

He quickly took deep breaths, his face pale and watching these people with fear.

He shouldn’t have spoken up! He almost lost his life again!

Ahao continued to breathe deeply, then slowly patted his chest, calming himself.

Ahao had now become wise and dared not move at all, even looking at these people was forbidden.

Those events had scared him to death!

“Longge, when I was punishing him, you didn’t stop me. Now that he knows what we’re doing, you still block me? What’s so important about this guy?”

Achuan was very angry and felt discontented: “Longge, are you even on our side? Why do you always help this stranger?”

Achuan spoke again, venting his feelings. He felt that Longge was always against him.

“Who knows if this guy will interfere with Hongye’s matters? Who can bear the responsibility?”

Before Longge could answer, Achuan spoke again, arguing to make Longge accept his suggestion.

“No! No!”

Ahao heard them quarrel and thought they were going to attack him. At this moment, his will to live was strong, so he quickly explained: “Brothers! I don’t know what you’re talking about. I didn’t hear anything!”

Ahao knew that the more he knew, the more dangerous it was. Especially after hearing their conversation, he felt even more cautious; otherwise, his life would be in danger.

“I didn’t see you today! I promise I won’t say anything!”

Ahao continued to explain, fearing they would kill him.

“I just wanted to help you out of kindness! I truly had no ill intentions! Please spare me!”

Ahao continued to explain, fearing they would kill him.

“I have some influence in the mountain village, so I dare to help you brothers. If you don’t need it, just pretend I said nothing! Nothing at all!”

Ahao’s will to live was very strong.

He also cleverly presented his identity, trying to show them his value so they wouldn’t kill him easily.

“Oh? Your tone suggests you have some authority here?”

Longge stepped forward, as if thinking of something, and asked Ahao.

“Authority? I don’t dare say that. But I’m a small local boss here, and I know this area pretty well.”

Ahao saw that they were interested in him, so he saw hope for survival and quickly stated his position.

When Longge heard this, his eyes flashed with a thought. He felt that maybe this person could truly help them.

After thinking, Longge stepped forward again to talk with Ahao in detail.

“Longge!”

At this moment, Achuan quickly grabbed Longge and said anxiously: “Longge, what are you doing? This guy is unknown to us. We shouldn’t trust him so easily! If Hongye finds out, he’ll punish us!”

Achuan said this with a face full of fear. It wasn’t just joking; he was truly afraid of Hongye.

The other people also showed worried expressions, clearly not agreeing with Longge’s decision. They felt that Longge’s choice was abrupt.

“Right, Longge, Achuan is right. Caution leads to a long life; we should be careful.”

The other men also advised Longge, hoping he wouldn’t be deceived by this unknown stranger.

Longge waved his hand: “What’s there to fear? He doesn’t know what we’re looking for. At most, he can help us a little. Let’s take the risk; maybe this mission will succeed and please Hongye.”

After saying this, Longge clearly made up his mind.

The other people saw they couldn’t persuade Longge and exchanged glances before reluctantly staying silent, no one spoke again.

At this moment, Longge stepped forward again and continued to question Ahao: “We came here to find someone. Since you say you’re capable, I’ll give you this chance. Come on, help us find this person. Do you know him?”

After saying that, Longge took out his phone and opened the photo, enlarging it for Ahao to see.

This was a photo taken from surveillance—Su Nantian’s picture.

“This person…”

Ahao furrowed his brows, trying to identify the photo for his life.

The resolution was low, so it wasn’t very clear, but he looked very similar to someone he knew.

“Who is this? Who is it?”

Ahao put his hand under his chin, looking thoughtful. He felt this person was very familiar.

“Ah! I know!”

At this moment, Ahao suddenly spoke out, excited because he had found the person: “I know! This is Wang Li from the fishing village! It’s him! There’s no mistake!”

After confirming it was Su Nantian, Ahao kept thinking in his heart: This is Su Nantian. Even if he were ashes, Ahao would recognize him.

“Longge, I know who this person is and where he is!”

At this moment, Ahao turned to look at Longge and the others, saying earnestly.

“Do you know who this person is?”

Longge looked at Ahao in surprise.

Even Achuan and the others turned their heads, focusing all their attention on Ahao.

Especially Longge; he had originally wanted to test, but luck was good—he had met someone who knew the person they were looking for!

“Do you really know him?”

Longge asked again, wanting to confirm the answer.

Achuan was hot-tempered and stepped forward again, grabbing Ahao’s collar with a threatening tone: “You dare to deceive us? If you’re lying, be careful about your life!”

Chapter 812: Found

After hearing this, Ahao shrank his shoulders and shook his head like a bobblehead, then quickly assured: “I really have seen this person. But I don’t know if he’s the one you’re looking for. Just trust me, I won’t deceive you!”

Ahao knew these people weren’t easy to deal with. How could he provoke them?

Now, Ahao was thinking that if these people had a grudge with Su Nantian, it would be perfect. He could use them to eliminate Su Nantian and avoid being involved himself.

After thinking this through, Ahao felt extremely excited.

“I really won’t deceive you!”

At this moment, Ahao added another sentence, explaining earnestly.

Achuan and the others heard this assurance and believed half of it.

“Hmph, I guess you dare not play tricks in front of us!”

Achuan said this directly and looked down on Ahao.

But his threat wasn’t a joke, nor did he give Ahao any chance to lie.

“Enough, it’s not the time for this,”

Longge interrupted Achuan’s threat and looked at Ahao seriously: “Speak up. Who is this person? Where did you see him? Tell us everything. If you cooperate, we can give you unexpected benefits. But if we find out you’re lying, don’t blame us for being ruthless.”

Longge threatened Ahao seriously this time and clearly indicated that if Ahao had any wrong thoughts, he would punish him harshly.

Ahao was scared and swallowed his saliva again.

How did he feel like he was dealing with a tiger? His actions were extremely dangerous!

But since he had chosen to tell them and decided to cooperate with them, Ahao wouldn’t change his mind.

Moreover, facing these people, he knew there was no place to retreat.

“I’ll tell you!”

So Ahao told them about Su Nantian’s presence in the fishing village, including what Su Nantian had done to them. He even exaggerated his description of Su Nantian’s cruelty.

“Haha, it seems this person has many grudges with you!”

At this moment, Achuan interjected with a mocking smile, looking at Ahao’s arm. Since he knew Ahao had been crippled by Su Nantian, Achuan felt like laughing.

“So you can trust me! This Wang Li is my enemy, and I hope you’ll deal with him. I won’t deceive you!”

Ahao noticed Achuan’s mocking gaze but had no choice but to bow his head. After all, he couldn’t fight these people. So Ahao could only endure his inner annoyance.

Moreover, Ahao knew that the priority now was to deal with Su Nantian. He had a rare opportunity to use others to kill him—why not take it?

Why be hesitant and计较 about unimportant things?

“But this Wang Li is very strong! You must be careful when you confront him. I was careless and got such a serious injury!”

After saying this, Ahao added another sentence.

Ahao warned them about Su Nantian’s strength, but he hoped they would be unprepared and get eliminated by Su Nantian. That way, he wouldn’t have to take revenge.

“Hmph!”

At this moment, Achuan let out a cold laugh: “Strong? We’re not people to be underestimated.”

After saying this, Achuan raised his chin proudly and didn’t look at Su Nantian at all.

“Achuan, don’t be too proud. Remember, overconfident soldiers are doomed.”

Longge interrupted Achuan’s pride and reminded: “Hongye has repeatedly warned us to be careful with this person. And we’ve seen the surveillance video; how strong is he?”

In short, they must not underestimate Su Nantian and must not be arrogant in front of him.

Those who had seen the video knew about Su Nantian’s mysterious power, especially seeing how he defeated so many people from the Wu family and killed them all. Longge felt even more anxious, believing they must not underestimate Su Nantian.

Especially now that Ahao said Su Nantian had used those strange abilities when he punished them, they were even more certain this person was the one they were looking for and must be careful.

But they still needed to meet him in person to confirm, no room for error; otherwise, if there were problems, it would be hard to explain to Hongye.

They quickly asked for the address and prepared to act.

“Longge, should we inform Hongye first?”

At this moment, Achuan asked Longge’s opinion. After all, they had found such an important person; how could they not report it?

Moreover, Achuan and the others were very curious about who Su Nantian was. Why did Hongye value him so much and send so many people to find him?

They had essentially sent everyone out, anyone not on an important mission was dispatched to search for Su Nantian.

They had wasted so much time and worked hard, but now they finally had a lead and could relax slightly.

And since their team was the first to find this information, they definitely needed to report it to Longye and take credit.

“No.”

Longge shook his head: “Don’t rush.”

After saying this, he saw Achuan’s confusion and reluctance and explained: “We haven’t confirmed if this person is the one we’re looking for. We need to check first and then inform Hongye, so as not to let Hongye be disappointed.”

A false joy wasn’t the biggest problem; the worst was if Hongye thought they were incompetent and punished them.

So, don’t get overconfident.

“Okay.”

Achuan was still reluctant but thought Longge’s words made sense: “Then, Longge, let’s go to the fishing village quickly and confirm if it’s who we’re looking for!”

After confirming, they would immediately inform Hongye.

On the other hand, Ahao watched them leave and smiled with great satisfaction inside. Su Nantian would have trouble now, and he was the happiest one. He also desperately hoped these people would severely punish Su Nantian.

“Hmph! Wang Li, you won’t be happy for long!”

Ahao let out another cold laugh and thought about Su Nantian being found by these people and severely punished.

Ahao had clearly seen that these people weren’t good people at all, and they definitely didn’t have any mercy. They would certainly not show any leniency to Su Nantian.

Because of this, Ahao was even more delighted. He longed for Su Nantian to be dealt with quickly and not bother him anymore.

Especially if he was punished severely.

Once that happened, Ahao would definitely go to mock Su Nantian himself.

How dare he be arrogant in front of me again!

“This, brothers, do you have anything else to instruct me?”

Ahao had been secretly happy earlier. He thought these people would go find Su Nantian’s trouble, and he could be safe and use others to deal with Su Nantian.

It was a win-win situation, and he could use others to deal with Su Nantian without having to do it himself.

Just thinking about this made Ahao feel great and relieved.

He could easily ignore the incident where he had been mocked by Su Nantian and Xiao Chen.

At this moment, Ahao was preparing to go home happily, take a shower and celebrate, washing away his bad luck today.

But he hadn’t expected these people who had just asked him questions to suddenly return, and when they saw them coming back, Ahao was terrified.

His heart pounded rapidly, his breath instinctively held in, and he couldn’t breathe normally.

But Ahao was afraid of drawing their attention, so he remained cautious and didn’t show any big reactions.

So now Ahao quickly took a deep breath, calming himself and then spoke politely to Longge and the others.

“Is there anything else?”

Achuan, with his short temper, heard Ahao’s voice and immediately scoffed, interrupting him: “You just keep quiet. Don’t ask anything else.”

“Ah, yes.”

When Ahao heard this, his heart jumped again and he muttered to himself: “Bad luck.” But he couldn’t refuse.

He was pale-faced and felt terrified, thinking that maybe these people thought he knew their plan and wanted to come back and kill him.

Thinking about this, Ahao’s face turned pale immediately.

He knew!

Any matter connected to Su Nantian would definitely not be good.

Here it was, and he had been caught up in it too!

Thinking about this, Ahao hated Su Nantian even more.

But now wasn’t the time to dwell on Su Nantian; the priority was to calm these people’s emotions and avoid them killing him.

After thinking about the priorities, Ahao quickly thought of a way to escape and make these people overlook him without confronting him.

“Brothers, I’ve already told you everything. I don’t know anything and won’t say a word to anyone! Please believe me!”

At this moment, Ahao quickly lowered himself and begged for mercy, just to save his life.

These cowardly actions were nothing now.

So Ahao didn’t care about his face anymore, just wanted to live.

After all, once these people left, they wouldn’t know who he was.

The embarrassment of today would only be known to himself, but losing his life was a different matter.

Therefore, Ahao had made up his mind to escape as quickly as possible.

After thinking this through, Ahao quickly apologized and didn’t care about his dignity anymore; he just wanted these people to let him go.

Moreover, he really didn’t want to lose his life in this matter, especially one connected with Su Nantian. That made Ahao even more angry and upset.

“I swear to you, I won’t say a word! I won’t tell anyone!”

At this moment, Ahao quickly assured them, fearing they would kill him: “Please believe me! Even if I had the courage of a bear and leopard, I wouldn’t act recklessly!”

Ahao begged while looking at Longge and the others earnestly, his heart anxious as if a knife was hanging over his head.

“Enough, don’t beg so quickly. We’re not here to take your life or have any interest in it.”

At this moment, Longge spoke up, interrupting Ahao’s pleas and giving Achuan a look to signal him not to speak further or scare Ahao.

Then he turned to Ahao: “Don’t worry, we have no interest in your life for now.”

After hearing this, Ahao’s heart slowly dropped back to its place and felt relieved.

But he heard the prefix, knowing they definitely had conditions. He quickly asked with a respectful expression:

“What else can I do for you brothers? Just command me, and I’ll do everything I can to help without holding back.”

At this moment, Ahao quickly assured them of his abilities, trying to show them his value so they wouldn’t kill him easily.

Longge saw Ahao was easy to deal with and looked at him, his eyes flashing a brief satisfaction.

“You’re easier to deal with than others.”

Longge said this, but his words still carried a tone of disdain for Ahao.

But Ahao now had no choice but to bow his head, even though he felt uncomfortable. Especially since their tone made him feel uneasy, but he dared not show any resistance or resentment.

Otherwise, one mistake and he would be dead.

“Longge, you’re right. This bastard is really afraid of death! He changed so fast!”

Achuan said this jokingly, his words full of mockery and contempt for Ahao.
