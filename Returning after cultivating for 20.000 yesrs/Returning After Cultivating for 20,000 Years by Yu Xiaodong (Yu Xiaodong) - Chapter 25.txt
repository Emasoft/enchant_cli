At this moment, Su Nantian's body collapsed instantly! It was only when Su Yujian noticed that his back had been blasted into bloody ruin by the lightning bombs, and he had merely maintained consciousness through sheer willpower.

At last, all formidable enemies were eliminated, and as Su Nantian's breath released, he could no longer hold on.

"Don't bother me—check on Yao Lina! Oh my god, it really hurts!"

Su Nantian lay on the ground, exhausted and gritting his teeth as he spoke to Su Yujian.

Su Yujian merely scoffed, saying nothing. His body swayed slightly, and his attire instantly transformed into Su Nantian's appearance—though he still clutched the gleaming long sword in his hand.

Shaking his head with resignation, he lunged toward Su Nantian's body and merged into it instantly.

Su Nantian on the ground seemed to revive completely, his injuries all healed and even his torn clothes restored.

He clapped his hands and rose from the ground, stretching his neck.

"Haha, this is what it feels like to have a physical body!"

Though Su Nantian and Su Yujian spoke with the same voice and bore identical appearances, only someone like Su Yujian could say such words.

At this moment, Su Nantian was in a deep healing trance, and the body was temporarily under Su Yujian's control.

In truth, there wasn't much difference—after all, they were one and the same person.

Compared to Su Nantian's usual air of casual mischief, Su Yujian was truly ethereal and refined. His every movement perfectly embodied the image of a celestial prince, untouched by worldly affairs.

This was because Su Yujian's existence largely relied on the faith of his followers, and unconsciously, he was influenced by them.

But this was only possible because Su Yujian still possessed Su Nantian's true soul will. Otherwise, if it were merely faith that made him a god, everything would manifest exactly as the believers envisioned.

Su Yujian adjusted to his new body and then turned toward the inner room. Wu Changshan had locked Yao Lina inside before leaving.

Though the battle outside had been fierce, this small room remained largely undisturbed. Plus, Yao Lina's jade bracelet had activated a protective shield—she suffered no harm, though she was naturally frightened.

Su Yujian opened the door and saw Yao Lina immediately rush toward him, her shield shattering as she threw herself into his arms.

Feeling the body of this young girl in his embrace, Su Yujian felt an unfamiliar urge. This sensation was strange to him—something he had never experienced before.

Though awkward and unsure, it felt oddly pleasant.

The two of them clung to each other without noticing a shadow approaching silently.

Ren Zhengyang watched the battle from afar, his jaw dropping in disbelief!

He even wondered if he had accidentally traveled to another world—was this still the original Earth?

He hadn't heard of such terrifying beings existing on Earth before!

But regardless, this was his opportunity. Ren Zhengyang had never felt such a strong desire to do something before—he wanted to learn these divine arts!

He yearned for immense power and sought the path of immortality.

Hmm, this might sound a bit over-the-top. But Ren Zhengyang suddenly felt that this was exactly what he should pursue!

What else could be worth striving for? Wealth? Power? They were easily obtainable and discarded without a second thought.

As the saying goes: "Two decades in this chaotic world, untouched by hardship or struggle. Fame and fortune are but dust; you become a high-ranking official while I ascend to immortality!"

Ren Zhengyang suddenly felt he had attained enlightenment.

Chapter 113: Taking a Disciple

While Su Nantian and Yao Lina were still entangled, someone suddenly ran out from the ruins in the distance.

Though he looked somewhat plump, his speed was surprisingly fast.

If Su Nantian hadn't sensed any trace of spiritual energy from him, he might have mistaken this man for enemy reinforcements and killed him on the spot.

The two of them stared at him, but Ren Zhengyang showed no fear and ran straight to Su Nantian's feet, kneeling with a loud *crack*.

He quickly grabbed Su Nantian's legs and looked up, shouting: "Master, I've searched for you so hard! Finally found you!"

Yao Lina was stunned by this man's sudden appearance and asked Su Nantian, "This... is your disciple?"

"Uh... no. Who are you?"

Su Yujian was also confused, though he was currently impersonating Su Nantian. He knew everything about Su Nantian and had never heard of such a shameless disciple.

"Who are you?"

Su Yujian was unsure, wondering if Su Nantian had truly taken such a shameless disciple.

"Master, I'm Ren Zhengyang!"

"Oh! Oh, Xiao Yang!"

Su Yujian feigned sudden understanding but actually knew nothing.

"Um... Xiao Yang, take your mistress home, I have some matters to attend to."

He handed Yao Lina over to this unexpected Ren Zhengyang, along with the severely injured Death Raven.

To be honest, Wu Changshan's array was quite powerful—spending heavily on countless lightning bombs. It had the potential to kill Su Nantian.

At the last moment, the Death Raven shielded him and absorbed the initial explosion. Otherwise, even if Su Nantian hadn't died on the spot, he wouldn't have had the strength to retaliate.

Though Su Yujian didn't know Ren Zhengyang, he felt at ease—after all, this was just an ordinary person who couldn't harm Yao Lina.

After sending Yao Lina and Ren Zhengyang away, Su Yujian began cleaning up the battlefield. Though defeating these three Wu family elders and their shadow troops yielded no tangible rewards, he still had to erase all evidence.

He didn't mind their deaths but didn't want trouble.

"Ugh!"

After finishing the battlefield, Su Nantian's body split again—this time into two: one was the blue-cloaked Su Yujian, and the other was the injured Su Nantian.

Compared to before, Su Nantian's condition had improved significantly—his injuries were nearly all healed, though his face was pale and he walked unsteadily.

"How are you?"

Su Yujian asked Su Nantian, his tone neither concerned nor particularly emotional. It was strange to ask about one's own injuries.

"Ugh, I'm fine—no major issues. With your help returning home, after a night's rest, everything will be fine."

Su Yujian nodded and said nothing more. His body shimmered, merging back into Su Nantian's.

He also consumed some faith energy to restore his clothes.

As Su Yujian's energy flowed in, Su Nantian felt better. He took a deep breath and turned to his car, heading back to Fengyue Community.

"Oh my god, Nantian, you're finally back! I was so worried about you!"

As soon as he returned home, Yao Lina—who had been anxiously waiting on the sofa—rushed into his arms again, hugging him tightly as if afraid he'd leave.

"Relax, I'm fine! I've returned!"

Su Nantian gently patted Yao Lina's back while glancing at the room. At that moment, Lin Suyun, Gao Jingjing, and even Ren Zhengyang were all present.

When Su Nantian's gaze fell on him, Ren Zhengyang couldn't help but give him a thumbs-up. My master is truly powerful!

When he had delivered Yao Lina home, he thought she was his mistress. Having such a beautiful and well-endowed mistress wouldn't disappoint his master's title.

But he hadn't expected that upon arriving at Fengyue Community, his mistress was no longer just one.

Whether it was the elegant and graceful Lin Suyun or the innocent and adorable Gao Jingjing, each girl had her own charm and was no less remarkable than Yao Lina.

Though Ren Zhengyang had spent years saving fallen women, he never imagined such high-quality girls—three at once. He truly admired his master's ability to manage three mistresses without conflict.

Even emperors had palace intrigues, but in this era of gender equality, it was truly admirable.

"Alright, everyone—don't worry. I'm fine!" Su Nantian comforted Yao Lina while addressing Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing.

Though the two women hadn't rushed toward him, their anxious glances didn't escape Su Nantian's eyes. Clearly, they were also deeply concerned.

He hugged Yao Lina and placed her on the sofa before sitting down himself.

Though his body was supported by Su Yujian's energy, he truly felt exhausted.

"Rest easy—no one was harmed. But from now on, when you go out, make sure to wear the jade ornaments I gave you.

You know I have some special abilities and face powerful enemies. These jade ornaments are imbued with defensive arrays, capable of protecting you from harm for a short time!"

Hearing Su Nantian's words, Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing nodded without further comment and headed to the kitchen.

It was already evening, and the day had been wasted. In their eyes, Su Nantian must have been starving.

They hadn't wanted to let Su Nantian cook again today, so they decided to prepare a lavish dinner for their beloved.

"Alright, now it's your turn! Kid, introduce yourself—why do I not recall ever taking you as a disciple?"

Seeing Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing enter the kitchen, Yao Lina curled up on the sofa and fell asleep. Su Nantian turned to Ren Zhengyang with a sly smile.

Chapter 114: Cleverness

"Master, I'm Ren Zhengyang. Though you've never seen me before, I've long since decided to be your disciple! When I saw you defeating enemies and avenging yourself on the battlefield, I felt a deep admiration. I want to become a hero who upholds justice like you!

Master, please take me as your disciple!"

Su Nantian looked at Ren Zhengyang and hesitated. Though he had witnessed the fight with Wu's family, this wasn't particularly difficult—denying it would be enough. If necessary, he could even kill him to silence him.

What troubled Su Nantian was that Ren Zhengyang actually possessed the potential for cultivation—his rare wooden spiritual root was quite unexpected!

The concept of five-element spiritual roots is common in the cultivation world, serving as a key criterion for sects to select disciples.

Though those without spiritual roots could still cultivate, it was undeniable that having one made progress significantly faster.

Especially with this man's rare wooden spiritual root, if he were in the cultivation world, he would be a top-tier talent sought after by sects. Even elders at the Golden Core or Nascent Soul stages would vie for him.

Yet Su Nantian was merely at the sixth level of Cultivation, and now had such a disciple under his tutelage. This made him reluctant to part with him.

But on the other hand, he truly didn't want to take this man as a disciple. There was no specific reason—just his laziness.

Taking disciples was too complicated and exhausting!

But then Su Nantian thought of a brilliant idea. He glanced toward the kitchen, confirming that Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing weren't paying attention.

Su Nantian's body shimmered, and Su Yujian appeared. This sight left Ren Zhengyang stunned, his mouth wide open and drooling as he gazed at him with admiration.

Though this scene had occurred before in the western suburbs, it wasn't as震撼 as this close-up view.

After Su Yujian appeared, he glanced at Su Nantian but then turned to Ren Zhengyang and said: "I am Su Yujian. From now on, I will be your teacher!"

Hearing this, Ren Zhengyang was overjoyed. He hadn't expected this high-level figure to actually accept him as a disciple, though he had confidence in Su Nantian's acceptance. But he hadn't anticipated it would be so simple.

Su Nantian didn't care about Ren Zhengyang's thoughts and waved his hand, producing a small piece of jade. A purple spiritual fire appeared, slowly burning the jade.

Under Su Nantian's control, the jade melted into liquid and was reshaped. A small statue of Su Yujian appeared before Ren Zhengyang.

"Once you return home, burn incense and worship this statue daily—it will guide your cultivation!"

Though Ren Zhengyang was a bit confused, he carefully accepted the jade statue.

Su Yujian formed his right hand into a sword finger and touched the statue's forehead, sending a golden light into it. Instantly, the statue seemed to come alive, exuding an ethereal aura.

After saying this, Su Yujian waved his hand and vanished, returning to the altar.

"Master... what about me?"

Though it was Su Yujian who had accepted him, Ren Zhengyang wasn't foolish. He had seen Su Yujian separate from Su Nantian's body and clearly understood their relationship wasn't as simple as he had imagined.

So, he addressed Su Nantian as "Master" too.

"You? Why are you still here? I've given you what you needed. Your future cultivation will be guided by him! But your progress still depends on yourself."

Hearing Su Nantian's words, Ren Zhengyang's face lit up with joy. He fished out a business card and respectfully placed it beside Su Nantian, saying: "If my master has anything to do, I'll serve him. Though I may not have your divine power, I'll never hesitate if you ask me."

This is my business card. If there's anything your master needs, just call this number.

I'll be staying in Fengcheng for now—always available!"

Ren Zhengyang's words left Su Nantian stunned. He hadn't expected this disciple he had taken so casually to have such qualities.

Though a spoiled rich kid, he was from a prestigious family and wasn't truly a useless heir.

After leaving Fengyue Community, Ren Zhengyang drove his Ferrari, recalling all that had happened today. It felt like a dream.

He hadn't expected to meet someone as divine as this!

At that moment, Su Nantian had become a godlike figure in his eyes.

After all, Su Nantian had personally crafted this statue from jade, a technique far beyond ordinary comprehension.

And since the statue was produced and he was told to worship it daily, what else could it be but a true god?

Thinking this through, Ren Zhengyang hesitated and then dialed a phone number.

"Hey, brother—it's me!"

After the call connected, a strong voice replied: "Second brother, where have you gone this time?

Father has been furious about your disappearance. If there's no valid reason, it might be better for you to stay away for a while until father calms down."

The atmosphere in the study was quite delicate. Ren Zhengyang was currently in his grandfather's study, and sitting around him were his grandfather—the "old man" referred to by Ren Zhengyang's older brother.

Hearing his elder brother's words, Ren Zhengyang felt a strange warmth. According to logic, in such prestigious families, relationships among descendants are usually tense with competition and rivalry.

But the Ren family's two brothers were an exception—his older brother was very protective of him and had never sought to harm.

And Ren Zhengyang, the younger brother, showed no interest in family assets and spent his days indulging or chasing women—truly a man without ambition.

"I have something to tell you, brother."

At this moment, Ren Zhengyang's expression was very serious. For the first time in a long while, he looked genuinely determined, which shocked the person on the other end of the call.

"Speak up—I'm listening!"

This younger brother was rumored to be a spoiled rich kid with no talent.

But how terrifying he truly was, only his older brother knew.

Ten years ago, as a child, Ren Zhengyang had solemnly told him: "I am the second son. The family assets will definitely not fall to me!

I don't want to compete for anything, and I hope we can coexist peacefully without too many concerns."

Chapter 115: Buying Steel

This statement still echoed in Ren Zhengyang's older brother's ears to this day.

Though he couldn't recall the details of that time or what had happened, this sentence was particularly clear.

Indeed, since then, Ren Zhengyang had become a true spoiled rich kid, doing whatever he pleased and engaging in absurd activities.

Ren Zhengyang's older brother certainly didn't think his younger brother was truly like this—he just told himself that he posed no threat.

But now, it was the second time this younger brother had spoken to him in such a serious tone.

Ren Zhengyang was even a bit afraid, unsure what he wanted to say. Yet he took it seriously because it concerned his fate and that of everyone else.

"According to Grandpa's words, the family assets should be twenty percent for me, right?"

Ren Zhengyang didn't start by asking what to do but instead asked his older brother.

"Yes, it's not just Grandpa's promise—it's also legally documented. Why?"

Ren Zhengyang's older brother was confused, unsure why his younger brother brought this up.

"I've decided to shift my entire share of the assets toward Fengcheng. I'll probably settle there from now on."

Ren Zhengyang's words left his older brother speechless, unsure of what emotion he felt.

"Little brother, this idea is bad. Grandpa won't agree!"

"Brother, you'll help convince Grandpa, right?"

Faced with Ren Zhengyang's question, his older brother blushed slightly. He knew his younger brother too well—though he looked foolish, he was actually quite clever.

Though this younger brother had acted spoiled for years, his older brother still felt worried and even fearful.

Considering this, letting him stay in Fengcheng might be a good idea. Far from the power center of Beijing, he'd have no chance to inherit the Ren family's assets.

"Okay!"

Hearing his older brother's reply, Ren Zhengyang quietly hung up the phone. When he was little, he had always thought his older brother truly cared for him.

But later, Ren Zhengyang discovered that this older brother had cursed him.

That was when he clearly understood how insignificant family ties were compared to money and power.

"Good, at least now I have a goal by my master's side!"

It seemed he had figured something out. The red Ferrari transformed into a sharp blade, slicing through the streets of this small city.

But neither Su Nantian nor Ren Zhengyang could see this scene.

After sending off Ren Zhengyang, Su Nantian sat on the sofa, thinking about what had happened today. This battle had occurred too suddenly, leaving him with no preparation or expectation.

For a long time, Su Nantian had believed himself to be invincible. Yet this time he nearly failed in a back alley, which left him deeply unsatisfied.

Knowing about the cultivation world's circles, killing these elders would surely alert the Wu family of Hezhou. The next time they came, it wouldn't be these weaklings but possibly stronger opponents.

At this moment, Su Nantian still didn't know their target was only the Death Raven and that the order had come from the current Wu family patriarch.

He reviewed his techniques and skills for this stage but found no results.

In the 20,000 years of cultivation, he had always strived to improve and practice diligently. His energy density was so high that the cultivation stage didn't stay long.

But time had passed too long, and now he couldn't recall any experience.

However, there was another better idea to enhance his combat power—crafting a divine weapon!

For a long time, Su Nantian had no suitable materials or enemies requiring such effort. So he hadn't crafted a proper divine weapon, and now it had cost him dearly.

If he had possessed a flying sword today, even a low-grade one, it would have easily secured his victory!

Dinner was prepared by Lin Suyun. Of course, "prepared" meant she had merely called to order it.

She had initially been excited and rushed into the kitchen, but after almost blowing it up, she finally gave up this self-destructive method and let Su Nantian enjoy a meal.

After dinner, he arranged for Yao Lina to rest and realized she had been terrified today.

Su Nantian didn't return to his room but instead went alone to his usual training hall.

With a slight movement of his fingers, various items from his storage ring appeared before him—jade, food, beer, and grilled skewers. He wasn't sure when they were placed there.

He selected materials suitable for crafting a divine weapon but found none. Su Nantian勉强 crafted a small sword from jade, but when he tried to embed an array, the strength of the flying sword's array was too much for jade to withstand. It ended in failure.

It seemed he really needed to find someone!

"Pick up the phone and call Grandpa Lin."

"Hey, Xiao Tian, why are you calling me today?"

Grandpa Lin's voice came through the phone, sounding very happy.

"Uncle, I have something to ask for your help! Do you know any metal traders? I need some rare metals or a large amount of iron."

Su Nantian's request made Grandpa Lin roll his eyes. He didn't know what this son-in-law was up to again.

But in his mind, Su Nantian had always been a mature and composed person—brave yet methodical.

If he asked for these things, it must have a significant purpose. After thinking carefully, Grandpa Lin actually knew someone—a manager from his company.

"Xiao Tian, this is Manager Zhao of Oceanic Metal Trading Company. Call him tomorrow and talk to him; maybe you'll get some results.

Just say I introduced you, it's not hard to handle."

Hearing Grandpa Lin's assurance, Su Nantian felt slightly at ease. If he truly couldn't find any suitable materials on Earth, then he would have no choice but to extract them himself.

One ton of iron could yield only a few grams of mystic iron—this ratio was enough to make one vomit.

Yet, this "mystic iron" was merely the worst material for crafting weapons. If he relied solely on it to forge a flying sword, it was truly a dream!

Chapter 116: 500 Tons!

The next morning, Su Nantian called the manager Zhao of Oceanic Metal Trading Company. Hearing that Su Nantian was Grandpa Lin's son-in-law, Zhao was quite polite.

They arranged a meeting at 9 AM in the city center's teahouse.

Because of yesterday's events, Yao Lina was still emotionally unstable today.

Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing decided not to go out but stayed home with her.

At 8 AM, as Su Nantian was about to leave, a fiery red Ferrari pulled up at his doorstep.

"Master, where are you going? Let me take you!"

Ren Zhengyang got out of the car and earnestly said to Su Nantian.

Though this kid wasn't a good person, he had truly done it—showing respect and filial piety.

In the early morning, he came to serve, something a former Beijing aristocrat had never done.

Seeing this man was genuinely helping and not trying to show off, Su Nantian nodded.

"Master, do you know what you're discussing with Manager Zhao? Tell me so I can help!"

Hearing Su Nantian mention Oceanic Metal Trading's Manager Zhao, Ren Zhengyang felt a bit familiar and asked him.

"Just buying some metal," Su Nantian replied.

They chatted casually as the red Ferrari sped off, arriving at the teahouse shortly.

"Mr. Su, nice to meet you. I'm Manager Zhao. Please call me." Since Grandpa Lin introduced him, Manager Zhao didn't look down on Su Nantian.

Seeing Su Nantian arrive, he quickly approached to greet him.

"Hello, Manager Zhao. My purpose today is quite simple—just buying a large amount of metal materials from your company.

But the quantity I need is quite high, so it's a bother for Manager Zhao."

"Of course, of course!" Su Nantian's words didn't show much reaction from Manager Zhao, but he was unconvinced. Perhaps this was another spoiled rich kid using his grandfather's name to get cheap goods.

"How much do you plan to buy, Mr. Su?"

Hearing Manager Zhao's question, Su Nantian hadn't calculated it yet and estimated: "About 500 tons of steel, I think."

"Excuse me? What?"

Hearing Su Nantian's words, Manager Zhao almost spit out his tea. After catching his breath, he asked Su Nantian:

"500 tons!"

Su Nantian said it seriously without any joking.

Fifty tons of steel, in Su Nantian's view, was actually too little. One ton of steel could only yield a few grams of mystic iron—500 tons would be just a few pounds.

Plus, the mystic iron itself was of high quality; those few pounds wouldn't be much in volume. These might not even be enough to forge a single flying sword.

"Mr. Su, you're trying to mock me! Do you know how much 500 tons of steel is? Just by yourself, you probably can't handle such a large order!

Even if you could afford it, Oceanic Metal Trading couldn't provide it.

Though private sales are allowed now, fundamentally they're still state-controlled.

If you were to allocate 500 tons directly, the government would never let it pass."

Manager Zhao's words made Su Nantian stunned. He hadn't expected that even with his money, there were things he couldn't buy!

Actually, it wasn't Manager Zhao's fault—Su Nantian's conditions were just too demanding. 500 tons of steel was definitely no small number, and regardless of where it was placed, it was a terrifying amount of material.

"Then, Manager Zhao, how much can you provide? I'll find other solutions for the rest."

Su Nantian confirmed he couldn't get 500 tons and asked for a lesser amount.

"100 tons, that's the maximum I can provide. As for the rest, I'm afraid I can't help Mr. Su."

Su Nantian nodded. At least Oceanic Metal Trading was helping solve some problems, but other materials would have to be found gradually.

It seemed that in Chinese business culture, there's a habit of having several meals before and after.

After discussing the steel matter, they were about to go to a restaurant across the street when Ren Zhengyang—who had been largely unnoticed—suddenly spoke.

"Manager Zhao, I finally remembered who you are!" Ren Zhengyang pointed at the manager and asked: "Don't you have any notice that Oceanic Metal Trading Group now belongs to me?"

It must be said, Ren Zhengyang's words were quite bold.

"Who are you?"

Seemingly intimidated by this boldness, Manager Zhao spoke cautiously.

"I'm Ren Zhengyang, your new boss!"

Ren Zhengyang hadn't expected that Oceanic Metal Trading Company was actually his family's asset. He had never cared about this part before, as it was always managed by his older brother.

It wasn't until he insisted on moving his assets near Fengcheng that he discovered this.

"You're Ren Zhengyang, the chairman! I've heard of you for a long time but never met. Today's meeting is an honor, and I must drink several more cups with you!"

Recognizing Ren Zhengyang's identity, Manager Zhao immediately changed his attitude and asked respectfully.

"This is my master, Su Nantian. Is the steel stock really insufficient?"

Hearing Ren Zhengyang mention this again, Manager Zhao explained.

"Let me say, the company's metal stock is certainly sufficient. But it can't be used lightly—it's the last line of defense, and the entire Oceanic Metal Trading Company relies on this stock to circulate."

"Since it's sufficient, just give Mr. Su 500 tons!" Ren Zhengyang pinched his fingers and said casually to Manager Zhao.

"Mr. Chairman, I did say that using this resource would make our company's operations more difficult. It might face a series of problems!

Though selling Mr. Su 500 tons, but...

Wait, what did you mean by 'give'?"

"Exactly as you thought!"

Though this kid was spoiled and bad, he had a moment of strength.

"Alright, since you've spoken, I'll follow your instructions."

Manager Zhao sighed but ultimately chose to submit. There was no choice—he and his family relied on this job for a living, and future meals were provided by this Ren Zhengyang.

Chapter 117: Forging a Sword (Part I)

As for Manager Zhao's orders, he naturally couldn't disobey. But in his heart, he still had some resentment.

Oceanic Metal Trading Company was indeed a family asset of the Ren clan, but in daily operations, it had been mainly managed by Manager Zhao.

He had poured too much effort and dedication into this company, more than any other Ren family member.

But today, Ren Zhengyang had simply ordered him to give away all 500 tons of steel in the company's stock.

Though theoretically, the entire company belonged to Ren Zhengyang and he could do whatever he wanted, this destruction of Oceanic Metal Trading's future made Manager Zhao feel deeply disheartened.

He even questioned whether it was right to stay with Oceanic Metal Trading.

Should he consider another job? As a professional manager, he never lacked opportunities.

Ren Zhengyang didn't need to care about what Manager Zhao was thinking. He personally led Su Nantian to the dock warehouse, where 500 tons of steel were stored in several warehouses.

Su Nantian looked at the steel without expression. Though it was of good quality among ordinary steel, it was still insufficient for refining mystic iron.

But at this point, there was no choice—this was Earth, not the cultivation world, and resources were extremely scarce.

Since he had taken Ren Zhengyang as a disciple, there was no need to hide anything from him.

He extended his right hand and snapped his fingers, producing a purple spiritual fire at his fingertips. It floated there like a small flame from a lighter.

If Ren Zhengyang had seen this before, he would have found it unimaginable and his worldview shattered. But now, he remained calm, standing beside Su Nantian without showing any surprise.

After all, he had already witnessed the epic battle in the western suburbs—what else could surprise him?

But he didn't know that this purple flame represented the spiritual fire of a ghost, incomparable to ordinary flames!
