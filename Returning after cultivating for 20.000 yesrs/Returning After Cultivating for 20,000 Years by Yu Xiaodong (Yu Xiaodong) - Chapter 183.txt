The three men worked in unison—one digging a grave, another carrying corpses, and the third erecting a tombstone. Their movements were so seamless that they seemed drained of all strength afterward.

Even Su Nantian, who rarely felt fatigue, now felt utterly exhausted and devoid of any spirit.

After arranging all the corpses, a refreshing breeze swept through, gradually dispersing the lingering scent of blood. Yet it could not dispel the heavy atmosphere surrounding Su Nantian and his companions.

This day's memories would be unforgettable for them all.

After settling the villagers, they returned to Xiaowang's room. Seeing him still asleep, Su Nantian and the others sighed deeply.

"Tian Ge, what should we do? Since they said they were determined to take Xiaowang, one attempt won't be enough. If we stay in the fishing village, it's like standing as a target."

After pondering, Chen and his companions explained the dangers to Su Nantian.

"Of course, we'll stay here."

Su Nantian's decision differed from Chen's. As a strong-willed person, he thought differently. Chen and the others always believed they couldn't confront these people, so they avoided confrontation whenever possible.

But Su Nantian was different. His thoughts were direct and ruthless. He reasoned that since these people wanted something here, they would surely return. Moreover, the leader had said their master was determined to take Xiaowang. That meant they would definitely come back.

Why then should he go through the trouble of leaving? Why not wait here and ambush them, thus uncovering Xiaowang's identity and avenging the villagers of the fishing village?

"Rest assured, I'll stay with Xiaowang. You three should find a place to leave."

After stating his plan, Su Nantian looked at them and reassured: "You three are ordinary people. There's no need to stay here with me."

They had the right to avoid danger. Besides, Su Nantian didn't want all the villagers of the fishing village to perish here.

At this moment, Su Nantian still didn't know who the leader's "master" was or how many people they would send next. If he couldn't control the situation when they arrived, what then?

Chapter 914: Waiting by the Tree

Su Nantian decided to let them go. As long as Chen and the others didn't actively seek out those people, they would never be in danger. As long as they were safe, Su Nantian would feel at ease.

"No! Tian Ge! We won't leave!"

Chen immediately refused, revealing his true thoughts to Su Nantian: "Tian Ge, if you stay here, how can we leave? If you're not afraid, neither are we!"

After Chen spoke, Chen Xiaoling and the young man also nodded quickly: "Yes, Tian Ge. We won't leave. We'll stay to help you."

Moreover, now that all the villagers were dead and only they remained, they didn't know where their future lay or where to go. So it was better to stay with Su Nantian, at least having someone to watch over each other.

"Fine. Then you stay for now, but be careful when danger arises and watch over Xiaowang."

After hearing their words, Su Nantian knew they had nowhere else to go. He sighed and changed his mind, allowing them to stay.

"If you ever want to leave in the future, just tell me directly. No need to hide it."

Su Nantian added this at the moment, carefully considering their future.

Moreover, Su Nantian's words weren't just empty talk. If they truly wanted to leave in the future, he wouldn't stop them.

"Tian Ge, rest assured. Wherever you go, we'll be there."

After hearing Su Nantian's words, they immediately pledged their support.

They were also very determined, vowing to follow Su Nantian without any regrets.

Hearing this, Su Nantian felt even more touched. But he knew people's thoughts changed over time. He wouldn't intentionally leave them to become enemies in the future.

So when they said this, Su Nantian didn't object. He just smiled at them.

Of course, Su Nantian was also thinking that if they truly wanted to leave in the future, he would never stop them.

Moreover, Su Nantian's private desire was to keep Chen and the others away from him. Whether it was his imagination or truly strange, Su Nantian felt he was a harbinger of misfortune. It seemed wherever he went, it brought disaster to that place. Like when those people came looking for him, they disrupted the peace of the fishing village.

If they hadn't come knocking, Su Nantian thought maybe the villagers wouldn't have been so quickly found. If they hadn't arrived here, the villagers wouldn't have died unnecessarily.

But no matter how much Su Nantian regretted and felt guilty, it was impossible to reverse or change what had happened.

Only now did Su Nantian truly understand. He used to believe his cultivation was strong, that he was more capable than ordinary people. Even Su Nantian thought he had surpassed them all, having no enemies.

He didn't even need to dodge when they used firearms. He faced them all directly without danger.

But after these events, Su Nantian truly realized his own insignificance and helplessness. He only now understood that no matter how unwilling he was, he couldn't save the villagers anymore. If he could exchange their lives for his own, Su Nantian would even sacrifice himself.

After thinking about this, Su Nantian sighed helplessly again. Though he knew regret was useless, he still felt endless sorrow, wondering why he hadn't returned earlier.

He also wondered why he had gone to the mountain to gather herbs today?

After saying goodbye to Chen and the others, Su Nantian returned to Xiaowang's room.

Su Nantian sat on the edge of the bed, watching Xiaowang who was still asleep. His expression softened slightly, but his mood remained heavy.

Xiaowang was only briefly unconscious. When he awoke, Su Nantian didn't know how to tell him the truth.

This cruel event was hard for even Su Nantian to accept.

And Xiaowang was just a child. Would he be able to bear it?

After thinking about this, Su Nantian's face darkened further.

If he had a choice, he would rather suffer himself than let Xiaowang, a child, learn this cruel truth.

"Xiaowang, rest assured. As long as I'm alive, I'll protect you."

Uncle Wang had entrusted Xiaowang to him before dying and repeatedly emphasized protecting Xiaowang. Su Nantian naturally wouldn't betray Uncle Wang's trust.

Even without Uncle Wang's trust, he would do his best to protect Xiaowang and keep him safe.

When the day came that Xiaowang was harmed, it would be because they had stepped over his corpse.

Su Nantian gently touched Xiaowang's head, gazed at his sleeping face, and then followed Uncle Wang's instructions to search for the items he had left. Uncle Wang had said that Xiaowang wasn't his biological grandson but was deeply connected to someone else.

Moreover, Uncle Wang had said that Xiaowang was actually his master's grandson. He had merely helped them out of their time of need and rescued Xiaowang.

So, the first step was to find items that could confirm Xiaowang's identity. If so, Su Nantian could follow the clues to find those people and discover why they wanted Xiaowang.

After thinking this through, Su Nantian didn't wait any longer but immediately went to the place Uncle Wang had mentioned to find those items.

Following Uncle Wang's instructions, Su Nantian opened the cabinet by the bed and took out the wooden box inside.

This object had been here for a long time, and when he first took it out, there was an old scent. However, the surface of the box was smooth and brand new.

Thinking about this, Su Nantian opened the wooden box immediately to see what was inside and how it could prove Xiaowang's identity.

But after opening it, he felt a bit disappointed. Inside was only a jade pendant.

Su Nantian didn't know the quality of jade and hadn't paid attention to such things. So when he saw this jade pendant, he felt no particular emotion.

But upon picking it up, Su Nantian noticed that this jade was warm.

Chapter 915: Xiaowang's Identity

The warm jade had a pleasant warmth, and it was engraved with some characters.

It turned out to be Xiaowang's birth date and time.

Su Nantian silently recited the characters engraved on it, then sighed helplessly.

He had originally thought that the items left by Uncle Wang would prove Xiaowang's identity. But now, after looking closely, it was only his birth date and time. It seemed impossible to determine who these people were.

But Su Nantian was not a pessimist. Even if he didn't find any useful clues in these items, he didn't feel it was a problem. He simply resealed the box and carefully placed it back inside.

He thought that those people had gone to such trouble to find Xiaowang and mentioned the existence of a master. They would definitely come again for another chance to capture Xiaowang.

After thinking this through, Su Nantian no longer worried. He thought he could patiently wait. As long as those people hadn't obtained Xiaowang, they would definitely return again. Then he could ask them more carefully.

But this time, Su Nantian was also thinking quietly that those people shouldn't think he was easy to fool or that his stubbornness could be so powerful.

If they refused to speak, Su Nantian wouldn't mind killing them all, just like he had done with the leader before.

At this moment, those people who Su Nantian was guessing were discussing Xiaowang's matter in their own territory.

Their location was extremely sinister and terrifying. The surrounding atmosphere was cold, and ordinary people would be chilled to the bone after staying there for a few days.

This entire mountain belonged to their territory, rarely visited by people. The layout was vast and had strict security with a clear hierarchy.

Moreover, because of the abundance of trees in this area, it was dark and cold all day long. No sunlight could penetrate through.

Everywhere were torches lit for illumination, but as the mountain peaks moved, they blew out the torches, making them flicker. Occasionally, people passed by and cast moving shadows on the walls.

Everything looked extremely strange. Ordinary people seeing this would definitely stop in their tracks and dare not move forward.

At that moment, deep within the mountain, a large space had been arranged. It was also very bright. In the center stood a chair made of tiger bones, covered with soft tiger fur and wolf hair.

At this moment, an old man in his fifties sat on it. His face was stern and radiated a cold, distant aura.

His face was wrapped in a swirling black mist, making it impossible to discern his appearance. One could only vaguely recognize some features.

But this black mist made the man radiate a dangerous aura, making anyone dare not provoke him or get close. Everyone feared that even a slight proximity would taint them with the black mist.

"Qin Wu, what's going on? Why hasn't he returned after being out for so long?"

The man slammed his hand on the armrest heavily.

His anger made his face appear even darker, and he looked extremely fierce. Everyone dared not look directly at him.

"What's going on? None of you can give me an explanation?"

The man's face was very grim. He had assigned this simple task to Qin Wu, but he hadn't received a satisfactory reply.

He knew that in the past, such simple tasks would have been completed by Qin Wu within a day. How could it be that now, after being out for several days, he hadn't returned and even failed to send a message?

This made the man very dissatisfied. He also felt that Qin Wu was being arrogant and hadn't taken his orders seriously.

Everyone below knew the man's temper. Seeing him angry, no one dared to be impolite and speak against him.

Everyone lowered their heads, afraid that if they made a mistake, the man's anger would spread and burn them.

"Master, perhaps Qin Wu encountered some trouble on the way and was delayed. If he had completed his task, why wouldn't he return to inform you?"

After a few minutes of silence, someone finally stepped forward and answered the man's question. He first respectfully bowed to the man and offered a greeting.

Then he analyzed the situation, and from his words, it was clear that he was on Qin Wu's side. Otherwise, his words wouldn't have constantly defended Qin Wu and tried to calm the master's emotions.

Of course, among these people, there were naturally different factions. After hearing the man's words, another person couldn't sit still and interrupted him.

He directly refuted his meaning: "I don't think so. If Qin Wu was really so diligent, why wouldn't he return and inform the master? He might have been delayed on the way, but sending a message to report in advance wouldn't be too troublesome."

The man who spoke had a thick beard and sarcastically mocked as he spoke.

"I think Qin Wu just got the master's favor, so he became arrogant. His actions slowed down. He clearly didn't respect the master's orders!"

After saying this, he paused and continued: "Otherwise, he would have informed the master in advance. Why wouldn't there be any news at all?"

After saying this, he didn't wait for others to respond and continued: "Look at it. The master only sent him to a small fishing village to bring back a child. This small fishing village is so remote, what trouble could there be? I think he just didn't consider it urgent or thought the master's orders weren't important, so he dragged his feet and delayed."

"No, Master, don't listen to He Wei's nonsense," the man who had previously spoken for Qin Wu immediately interrupted He Wei and glared at him angrily.

He had known all along that He Wei didn't like Qin Wu or them, and he would take any opportunity to spread dirt. But he hadn't expected that they had given him the chance.

Thinking about this, he sighed in his heart.

He knew that flies don't bite seamless eggs. If Qin Wu had been more alert, he wouldn't have given He Wei the chance to take advantage.

Moreover, Qin Wu's behavior now was completely different from his usual habits.

At this moment, they all thought that Qin Wu had probably not taken the master's orders seriously and was deliberately delaying outside, not eager to complete his task and return to report.

But they didn't know that Qin Wu might have already been dead outside. Or perhaps these people were arrogant, thinking their people would never be lost outside, so they all guessed in this direction.

"I didn't say anything wrong."

He Wei also wasn't afraid of this man. He not only spread dirt on Qin Wu but also didn't let go of this man.

He first coldly glanced at the man, then said to him: "Xiao Xu, I know that among our sect, you and Qin Wu are the best of friends. You two were always together. Of course, you would speak for him."

After a pause, He Wei continued: "But Xiao Xu, don't forget that even if you two are close, we are all under the master's command. What matters is total loyalty to the master. Other things don't matter."

This sentence was a big hat thrown on Xiao Xu's head.

If Xiao Xu still dared to argue, it would mean he didn't respect the master and had no loyalty to this sect.

When he heard this, Xiao Xu's face changed repeatedly, turning almost purple.

He couldn't say anything in response. His mouth opened and closed several times but he could not utter a single word of rebuttal.

He Wei wanted this effect. Seeing Xiao Xu speechless and unable to say anything in response, he smiled contentedly.

He Wei's eyes looked at Xiao Xu with a hint of provocation, as if saying, "If you have the ability, argue with me."

"You! You!"

Xiao Xu was furious but couldn't say anything inappropriate because the master was above him. Especially considering the master's current anger and how Qin Wu's behavior was indeed inappropriate, different from his usual habits.

At this moment, he couldn't argue anymore and had to swallow the humiliation silently.

"Master, should I lead a group to search for Qin Wu?"

After seeing that Xiao Xu didn't argue with him, He Wei smiled proudly and turned his gaze back to the master respectfully. He asked.

This attitude was a complete 180-degree turn from how he had treated Xiao Xu before.

The man's mood was already very bad, and his anger at Qin Wu's disobedience had not subsided. Now hearing He Wei's words, his face slightly softened.

"Only you understand my mind."

He said this and praised He Wei.

It was well known that when Qin Wu was around, the master didn't even have a place for He Wei. Now he had praised He Wei, which was truly a reversal of fortune.

If Qin Wu were still here, he wouldn't know how shocked he would be.

Xiao Xu saw He Wei's smug expression, which made his tail almost lift to the sky. He was extremely angry.

But he was outmatched and had been given a hat by He Wei, so even if he wanted to speak in Qin Wu's defense, it would be unclear.

Moreover, He Wei was extremely clever. He had immediately placed a hat on them, saying that Xiao Xu and Qin Wu were the closest friends. If he spoke in his favor, it would be biased support for him, making Xiao Xu unable to speak further.

He was afraid that if he insisted on defending Qin Wu, the master would despise him and think he lacked loyalty.

"Go check. How much time will this simple task waste?"

At this moment, the master's eyes turned cold. His voice was also very cold, clearly annoyed by Qin Wu's attitude.

He spoke again after saying this, and his expression became even colder.

He Wei heard the master's words and immediately showed a happy expression. He also patted his chest and promised loudly: "Master, rest assured. I will find Qin Wu immediately and question him. He will definitely give you an explanation."

This was not only a crucial moment to gain the master's favor but also more importantly, an opportunity to show off in front of Qin Wu.

He Wei had been tired of Qin Wu's arrogance before, as if he was the only one who received the master's favor. Now it was his turn to gain the master's favor, and Qin Wu had moved from a favored position to one of rejection.

As long as he persisted and completed several tasks and commands given by the master, he could later let Qin Wu be completely discarded in the master's ears.

Otherwise, when Qin Wu returned to the master and regained his favor, it would be the beginning of his trouble.

"Yes, leave this to you. Make sure it's done properly and don't disappoint me."

The master had just been very angry, but now he had slightly calmed down. His mood was no longer as furious as before. He softened his tone and gave a final warning.

He Wei had always been eager to show himself in front of the master. Now he had this opportunity, so naturally he would put ten times his effort into it and do it well. He definitely wouldn't let the master down.

After hearing this warning, He Wei nodded immediately and made repeated promises. He assured that he would definitely complete the task well and wouldn't let the master down, nor would he be as lazy as Qin Wu with such a small task.

"Yes, I'll leave it to you."

The master nodded and was satisfied. He withdrew his gaze and then stood up from the high seat to return to his room.

When they saw the master leave, they all lowered their heads and spoke in unison: "Respectfully send off the master."

"Congratulations, He Huifa."

After the master left, the sect's hall became lively. Those who had previously looked down on He Wei also came forward to flatter him, praising him with nice words.

This attitude was completely different from their usual disdain and arrogance.

He Wei also felt the change in people's faces.

They were completely changing their expressions, as if they had forgotten all their previous rejection of He Wei and now treated him warmly. They even said the best words to He Wei.

"Brother Wei is truly remarkable! The first time I saw Brother Wei, I knew he was different from us."

These subordinates kept praising him and continuously spoke sweet words, trying to flatter He Wei.

It seemed he was truly a dragon among men and would become the master's most trusted subordinate in the future.

But He Wei naturally understood this change in people's behavior.

So when they changed like this, He Wei also smiled and responded to them with an open attitude. He didn't feel any embarrassment.

He didn't bring up the previous matters either, but instead slowly maneuvered with them.

Seeing that He Wei didn't hold a grudge over the past, they all felt relieved and treated him even more warmly and enthusiastically.

They were afraid that He Wei would take revenge on them when he gained the master's favor, so they took this opportunity to flatter him.

"Thank you all for your kind words. Rest assured, I'm different from some people. If I ever gain power, I will elevate you all and never forget these brothers."

He Wei also bowed to them and made this promise, but his words were clearly mocking.

As for who he was mocking, it was obviously Qin Wu.

After all, when Qin Wu had gained the master's favor before, he had treated them with arrogance and had no humility. Otherwise, when they heard the master's questioning in the hall before, only Xiao Xu would have spoken up for Qin Wu.

"Hey He Wei, don't push your luck. If you have any complaints, just say them directly. But now you're being so sneaky and insinuating—exactly who are you trying to insult?"

Xiao Xu was now so angry he couldn't hold back and accused He Wei.

He felt that He Wei was deliberately doing this, knowing he was still here. He was mocking Qin Wu by mocking him, and thus mocking himself.

Thinking about this, Xiao Xu felt even more angry. He really thought of himself as a dish and didn't think about his own status.

"Am I pushing my luck? Did you get it wrong?"

He Wei spread his hands, hit himself on the chest, and then looked up at Xiao Xu with an arrogant gaze.

This time he seemed to have the master's support, so he wasn't afraid of Xiao Xu at all.

Before Qin Wu was in power, he had called Xiao Xu "Xiao Xu." Now this change in title made Xiao Xu feel very ridiculous.

How could he change so quickly and be so shameless? It seemed like all his previous attitude had been forgotten, as if he wasn't the same person.

The more he thought about this, the angrier Xiao Xu felt. He also realized that he had misjudged him.

"Enough, Xiao Xu. Don't argue with him," others also quickly came to stop Xiao Xu and prevent him from arguing further with He Wei.

Then they whispered in his ear: "Xiao Xu, think about it. He Wei has just gained the master's favor. If we provoke him now, we might get hurt."

After saying this, they advised Xiao Xu: "Let's just wait patiently. When Qin Wu returns, we'll tell him. He definitely won't forgive this He Wei."

Xiao Xu heard this and could only suppress his anger, not daring to argue with He Wei.

He Wei saw that Xiao Xu was silent and smiled even more confidently: "What? If you have nothing to say, I'll leave. After all, the master has given me orders to bring back Qin Wu."

After saying this, He Wei intentionally used the word "capture," as if he had already captured Qin Wu.

"You!"

Xiao Xu heard this and almost couldn't hold back his anger. Fortunately, the other subordinates quickly pulled him back and told him not to argue with He Wei, otherwise they would definitely fight.

"Brother Wei, you were truly formidable today!"

"Brother Wei is so impressive!"

He Wei's subordinates quickly flattered him. Thinking about how He Wei might have gained the master's favor, they immediately took out all the nice words they had heard before and poured them into He Wei's ears.

"Alright, rest assured. As long as you all truly follow me, I won't let you suffer."

He Wei knew these people were flattering him to have him protect them. If he had said it openly, they would have been happy.

"Thank you Brother Wei! Thank you Brother Wei!"

Others immediately thanked him happily.

"Brother Wei, when you eat meat, don't forget us. Let us have a sip of soup!"

Others also pledged their support, saying they would stand by He Wei.

"Alright, let's go. We need to set out and bring back Qin Wu."

He Wei interrupted their praises at this moment. Thinking about how long Qin Wu had been delayed without returning, He Wei felt extremely happy.

For so many years, he had been suppressed by this Qin Wu and couldn't rise. Now that he finally made a mistake, it was his chance to take over.

Thinking about this, He Wei felt proud. He thought that when Qin Wu returned and found his position taken over by him, the expression on his face would be very interesting.

Thinking about this, He Wei felt extremely excited. They didn't know that Qin Wu would never be surprised again because he had already been dealt with by Su Nantian. He didn't have the strength to even resist, let alone care about these trivial matters.

They quickly set out and prepared to find Qin Wu, clarify why he had failed in his duties, and ideally catch him with his flaws to report everything to the master. This would completely eliminate Qin Wu, and from now on, this position would be He Wei's!

With this thought in mind, He Wei immediately set out on his journey without feeling tired.

Not only did they take action, but the Xu family, who had been wiped out by Su Nantian, also started to take action.

When Su Nantian had come before, Xu Wen, the second son of the Xu family, was out of town on business and had luckily escaped.

But when he returned to the Xu family and found that his mother and brothers were all killed, he was extremely angry.

"What's going on?"

Xu Wen shouted when he returned to the Xu family. Everyone was so frightened they trembled, and no one could speak clearly about this incident.

"Ah Wen! You've finally returned!"

At that moment, Xu Xiangning also rushed down from her room. Seeing Xu Wen, she felt like she had found a second mother and calmed down immediately.

It was truly fate. That day, she had been with Grandmother Xu and others in the surveillance room watching outside. But Grandmother Xu found her annoying and sent her back to her room, forbidding her from coming out.

Because of this, Xu Xiangning had luckily escaped being killed by Su Nantian.

These days she had been anxious and worried, waiting for Xu Wen to return.

Now seeing that Xu Wen had finally returned, Xu Xiangning's heavy burden was immediately lifted. She quickly took a breath and rushed out to find Xu Wen.

"Big sister."

Xu Wen saw that Xu Xiangning was unharmed and felt a little relieved. Although he, like his brothers, didn't really like this Xu Xiangning, now that the entire Xu family was dead and only one person remained alive, he didn't have as many complaints about her.

"Big sister, what's going on?"

Xu Wen thought about Xu Xiangning who had stayed at home all this time and immediately asked her to explain the situation.

"Who was so bold as to attack our Xu family?"

Xu Wen had heard many rumors on his way back. Especially when people saw him, they kept pointing and whispering, no longer showing the previous reverence.

Xu Wen felt strange. Upon returning and finding his family dead, he was even more shocked.

The Xu family had a high status in M City. There had never been such an incident before, yet someone had dared to attack them while he was out on business.

Xu Wen's whole body trembled with anger and couldn't stay calm.

If he could, he would kill this person to avenge his family!

"Big sister, who was it? Who killed our family!"

After thinking about this, Xu Wen looked at Xu Xiangning desperately and wanted to find the answer from her.

"It was Su Nantian. He's the one who killed Wu Chuan!"

Xu Xiangning didn't hesitate and told Xu Wen the truth, trembling.

After saying this, she shivered again, as if recalling some terrifying scenes.

"Was it him?"

Xu Wen frowned in disbelief. They had previously guessed that Su Nantian might still be alive, so they had sent many people to search for him. But they hadn't expected that he was not only alive but had also returned with a counterattack, killing all the members of the Xu family.

"This damned bastard!"

After thinking this through, Xu Wen was angry and frowned again. His expression became even more furious.

They had underestimated Su Nantian from the beginning. He was not only alive but also successfully hidden, avoiding their search. Then he suddenly appeared and killed them all without anyone expecting it.

Thinking about this, Xu Wen felt Su Nantian was extremely despicable.

Thinking of his mother and brothers, he felt even more furious.

"Where is he now!"

Xu Wen asked angrily, gritting his teeth and forcing out this sentence from his throat. His face was full of anger.

Xu Xiangning, who had already been scared, started trembling again after hearing Xu Wen's question.

"I don't know."

Xu Xiangning answered with a sad face and added trembling: "On that day, I didn't come out or see him. I only saw his actions in the surveillance footage."

After answering Xu Wen, she trembled again: "Ah Wen, this guy isn't an ordinary person. You don't know how powerful his abilities are! Not even the ability users hired by our family could match him!"
