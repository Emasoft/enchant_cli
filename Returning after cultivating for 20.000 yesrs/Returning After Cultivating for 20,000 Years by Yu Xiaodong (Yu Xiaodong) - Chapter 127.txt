“Your words are correct... You have always been the clear-minded one. From start to finish, we were merely local gangsters on the mainland port. Ultimately, it was the Wu family who controlled this place; now it's the Nan Gong family. We possess no strength to oppose them. Originally, we felt justified in believing that the Nan Gong family wouldn't expend so much effort to disrupt our arrangement. But now, the Nan Gong family has severed its limb, altering the structure overnight. How can we confront them?”

Zhang Yuan spoke while shaking his head, suddenly feeling the absurdity of his former self.

“You understand now. We can no longer compare to the past. I've already stated that the Wu family supports their actions. The Wu family will certainly send someone to monitor events at the mainland port; they won’t entirely entrust it to the Nan Gong family this year. They’ve now become aware of the situation but remain indifferent, believing it poses no threat—perhaps even offers benefits. We must learn to compromise and accept this reality. Moreover, the ratio he mentioned earlier was only between Li Zhe and himself. If we are included, this proportion will shift, but what we gain will certainly be minimal—be prepared for that.”

Wang Bo continued, foreseeing they would receive far less than anticipated.

“What does it matter if we gain more or less? We are now merely dependent on their goodwill. Alright, I understand. Let’s return.”

After speaking, Zhang Yuan turned and walked back toward the room he had just left. He had accepted everything now.

Su Nantian observed Wang Bo and Zhang Yuan’s return with a smile, then asked: “How did it go? Have you two made your decision?”

“We have. We accept the current division ratio.” Wang Bo replied with a fawning grin.

Chapter 634: Negotiations

In truth, Su Nantian had foreseen all this. He knew the outcome would align with his prediction—there was no other result he would accept.

He glanced at Wang Bo’s fawning smile and then at Zhang Yuan, whose face bore no expression. He pointed at Zhang Yuan: “And you? Will you agree?”

Su Nantian knew Wang Bo had already discussed this with Zhang Yuan, but he now wished to hear Zhang Yuan’s own words—shattering the last remnants of his stubbornness and resolve.

Zhang Yuan lifted his head, nodded, and said: “I agree as well.”

“Good. Then I’ll explain how the division will proceed. Originally, before your involvement, Su Nantian’s family and Li Zhe split it fifty-fifty. Now that you two have joined, the Nan Gong family and Li Zhe each take ten percent, while you each receive ten. This is the ratio—do you have any objections?”

Indeed, one percent for each was meager. Previously, when they had collaborated with the Wu family in a seven-three split, Zhang Yuan alone could have claimed four percent. This drastic reduction was an immense shift for him.

Yet what could Zhang Yuan say? Wang Bo’s words had already awakened him; he knew he no longer possessed the right to refuse or rebel. He could only nod in acceptance.

“I understand.” Zhang Yuan said.

Wang Bo quickly added: “I do too.”

“Good. If everyone agrees, then proceed this way. This time, we’ll withhold the money to teach you a lesson. If that’s settled, then this matter is concluded. Should there be further issues, deal with Li Zhe directly—I’ll take my leave now.”

Su Nantian smiled and rose from his seat, exiting the room. He had finally resolved a major challenge in the mainland port—what was most difficult had been overcome, and the Nan Gong family would likely sail smoothly for a year.

Now Su Nantian needed to report his success to Nan Gong Yuyan and Nan Gong Lin. The two were waiting under the sun, for this matter was crucial to them.

He immediately drove back to the Nan Gong family. It was now eight in the morning, and according to routine, this was when the elder Nan Gong and his family finished breakfast.

When Su Nantian entered Nan Gong Lin’s villa, he saw them just finishing their meal and removing the dishes.

“Master, I’ve returned.” Su Nantian said respectfully upon entering the car, for his current role was still that of a bodyguard. To maintain his disguise, he must be thorough.

Nan Gong Yuyan and Nan Gong Lin had both awaited his news, yet their emotions differed starkly.

Nan Gong Yuyan had stared at him the moment he entered, her face betraying anxious urgency to learn the outcome.

Nan Gong Lin, however, remained unusually calm, as if nothing had transpired. After seeing Su Nantian again, he waved a hand and said: “How are you, Nantian? Haven’t eaten yet—have them save a portion for you. Don’t rush to clear the table.”

This gesture was also a statement: it meant if Su Nantian succeeded, he could dine with the Nan Gong family. If not, that meal would be unpalatable.

Upon hearing Su Nantian’s words, Nan Gong Lin immediately smiled and said to the servants: “Don’t bother saving it. Go fetch a fresh one from the kitchen—these are leftovers, not fit for consumption.”

Nan Gong Yuyan watched her father and Su Nantian’s默契, feeling puzzled. They weren’t discussing the most critical matter but instead spoke of breakfast, which she found unbearable.

“Why talk about breakfast? Have you completed the task? Why come for breakfast instead of discussing the mainland port?” Nan Gong Yuyan, seeing Su Nantian sit at the table as if he belonged there, grew angry and snatched his chopsticks from his hands, tossing them onto the table.

“Yuyan, what are you doing? Su Nantian went there in the dead of night to handle this matter. He returned just as they were cooking—let him eat breakfast, why make it seem like we’re starving him? If you spread this around, how would people view the Nan Gong family?”

Nan Gong Lin immediately intervened.

“Father, you two are in cahoots. Did you already know the outcome and kept it from me?” Nan Gong Yuyan realized something was amiss. If Nan Gong Lin’s usual temperament were considered, he wouldn’t have treated Su Nantian so kindly.

Seeing Nan Gong Yuyan’s anger, Nan Gong Lin finally said to Su Nantian: “Alright, tell her the outcome. Otherwise, you’ll never eat in peace—no matter how much food is placed before you, it would be snatched away.”

Su Nantian nodded and smiled: “Everything has been settled. The current batch of contraband is complete. Both Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo have accepted the ratio we proposed. The structure of the mainland port is now set. Proceed with a four-four-two split—every future contraband will follow this.”

After speaking, Su Nantian smiled at Nan Gong Yuyan and asked: “Miss Nan Gong, may I now eat?”

“Eat your head! Why didn’t you just say so earlier? It turns out Father already knew, leaving me the only one waiting for answers.”

Nan Gong Yuyan pouted and sat on the sofa, appearing slightly angry.

“Miss Nan Gong, don’t be angry with Master. He just learned of it recently. You simply didn’t catch the hint—this only proves your wisdom falls short of Master’s.” Su Nantian said with a smile.

Chapter 635: Unusual

Su Nantian’s words both mocked Nan Gong Yuyan and pleased Nan Gong Lin. By suggesting her wisdom lagged behind Nan Gong Lin’s, she could not refute it. Thus, Su Nantian had rarely made her look foolish.

“Who knows if you two have already colluded and exchanged signals? If it’s a signal between the two of you, how could I possibly understand?”

Nan Gong Yuyan realized Su Nantian was mocking her and shifted the topic to Nan Gong Lin, knowing Su Nantian would never mock Nan Gong Lin.

“Hahahaha! What signals? What collusion? It was merely a riddle I understood. That’s why he’s so shrewd.”

Nan Gong Lin’s words also carried an implicit meaning, subtly advising Su Nantian that excessive shrewdness was not always beneficial.

Su Nantian naturally grew solemn, understanding Nan Gong Lin’s warning—don’t think that completing this task grants you freedom in your work.

“Actually, when I entered, Master had just finished breakfast, and the servants were clearing the dishes. At that moment, Master asked if I wanted to eat breakfast. Do you remember that?”

Su Nantian recounted the events and asked Nan Gong Yuyan.

“Of course I do! It was only minutes ago—my memory isn’t that bad.” Nan Gong Yuyan replied, still confused.

Su Nantian realized she hadn’t grasped his meaning and decided to clarify it fully for her.

He smiled at Nan Gong Lin, who remained indifferent.

Su Nantian continued: “Master asked if I wanted to eat breakfast, meaning whether I could now partake in this meal. If I succeeded, I would eat it; if not, I couldn’t. When my grandfather said ‘eat breakfast,’ it meant I had completed the task.”

After Su Nantian spoke, Nan Gong Yuyan finally appeared enlightened. She pointed at both Nan Gong Lin and Su Nantian: “You two are really frustrating—why go through such a riddle when you’re already here? Just ask directly if the task was completed. Why go through so much trouble? I don’t understand your leisure.”

Nan Gong Yuyan said this with a pout, though she wasn’t truly angry—just playing childish.

“Alright, stop fooling around. If we’re discussing business, I’ll ask directly: what was the final ratio?” Nan Gong Lin asked. Su Nantian had only mentioned they reached an agreement within the expected range, but hadn’t specified the exact details.

“Four-four-two. We take four percent, Li Zhe takes four, and Wang Bo and Zhang Yuan together get two. It’s their own matter how they split it. Compared to when the Wu family controlled the mainland port, we now gain one percent more. But this time, all the money will go into our family’s pockets. Master’s funds I received earlier will soon be returned, with additional income.”

When Su Nantian had previously promised Nan Gong Lin, he had implied this money would be invested. Yet now it could also be reclaimed—this was Su Nantian’s exceptional performance.

Nan Gong Lin, upon hearing this, showed no great surprise; it had been within his expectations. For the Nan Gong family, this was not a major issue, so he remained calm. If he were always elated over minor matters, his family’s leadership would be unrefined.

He nodded and said: “Good job. If the matter is settled, that’s enough. You two eat and leave.”

Su Nantian and Nan Gong Yuyan could hear the dismissal in his words. Su Nantian himself hadn’t expected to stay for breakfast.

Thus, they both stood up, said goodbye to Nan Gong Lin, and left his villa together.

After watching Su Nantian and Nan Gong Yuyan depart, Nan Gong Lin asked his personal secretary: “What do you think of this man?”

“Whatever Master thinks, that’s how he is.” The secretary smiled and replied.

“For years you’ve been a mediator, always yielding to my preferences. I just feel this young man has talent and wisdom, yet he constantly unsettles me. Also, do you see anything unusual between Miss Yuyan and this man?”

As the saying goes, a father knows his daughter best. Nan Gong Lin had observed the subtle interactions between Nan Gong Yuyan and Su Nantian, recognizing that she regarded him unusually—placing him in a special position. Moreover, their gazes during conversations were different.

“The young man’s affairs I don’t fully understand, but it’s clear Miss Yuyan has never acted this way toward another man. Though I’ve introduced her to other young men, none have made her as lively and happy as this.”

The secretary’s words pierced Nan Gong Lin’s doubts.

At first, Nan Gong Lin had felt something unusual between them but couldn’t pinpoint it. Now, with the secretary’s words, he realized: it was the unique dynamic between Nan Gong Yuyan and Su Nantian.

Nan Gong Yuyan had always maintained a composed demeanor, even before Nan Gong Lin, striving to appear as a strong woman—always determined and never yielding.

But now she could openly act playful before Su Nantian. Though the situation involved her scolding Nan Gong Lin and Su Nantian for their riddle, she still acted naturally in his presence. This meant she had placed Su Nantian in a special position within her heart.

Chapter 636: Concerns

“Have someone investigate his background recently; he was too ordinary before. Dig deeper. Alright, I’m tired—go do this.”

After speaking, Nan Gong Lin slowly ascended the stairs toward his bedroom.

The family secretary immediately nodded respectfully and hurried to carry out Nan Gong Lin’s orders.

It was undeniable that Nan Gong Lin’s health had deteriorated over the years. Though he appeared to have strong vitality, his physical condition was known only to himself. Otherwise, how could he feel fatigued so soon after breakfast?

Nan Gong Lin publicly announced that his affairs would be entrusted to Nan Gong Yuyan and Nan Gong Ping, claiming it was preparation for their competition for the family head position. In truth, this was to conceal his worsening health.

He could no longer handle everything personally; if he continued doing so, it would accelerate his aging and health decline.

Thus, Nan Gong Lin urgently needed capable allies to assist his two children. Additionally, he was still uncertain about who would inherit the family head position.

Nan Gong Lin had ordered his secretary to investigate Su Nantian’s background, though it seemed like suspicion. In reality, this also demonstrated his genuine intention to utilize Su Nantian.

At present, besides Nan Gong Yuyan and Nan Gong Ping, the most talented individual in the Nan Gong family was him. Thus, Nan Gong Lin intended to use Su Nantian as an ally to assist his children.

Nan Gong Lin’s hesitation regarding the family head position also had its reasons. He could clearly see Nan Gong Yuyan’s talent surpassed Nan Gong Ping by more than just a little. However, as a woman, she inevitably faced inherent disadvantages.

Moreover, if he directly handed over the family head position to Nan Gong Yuyan, Nan Gong Ping would become a complete absentee, refusing to assist her. Even if he decided to help, Nan Gong Yuyan would not accept him, knowing his strength did not meet her standards.

Additionally, Nan Gong Yuyan had her own marriage matters; whether she married out or a man entered her family, it would inevitably lead to the division of their family’s assets.

Therefore, Nan Gong Lin hesitated over whether to pass on the family head position to Nan Gong Yuyan. In comparison, Nan Gong Ping’s situation was simpler—though his talent was average, he wasn’t entirely useless. If someone trustworthy and loyal supported him, and if others could be convinced, he would likely sit comfortably as the family head without major chaos.

It was undeniable that Nan Gong Lin had been meticulously pondering over the next generation’s matters. He needed to settle everything before he lost control and his mind failed.

At this moment, Su Nantian’s appearance ignited a glimmer of hope for him. Whether Su Nantian assisted Nan Gong Ping or Nan Gong Yuyan, it could resolve his two concerns.

Nan Gong Ping’s situation was obviously simple; now he lacked someone like Su Nantian to assist him. If Su Nantian’s background was thoroughly verified and he had no ulterior motives, he would be the ideal candidate.

As for Nan Gong Yuyan’s situation, it was slightly more complex. Today, Nan Gong Lin had noticed that she seemed to have a soft spot for Su Nantian. Thus, if Su Nantian were to marry into the family, it would be an excellent solution. However, this posed a slight threat to their family’s assets but minimized it effectively.

This was why Nan Gong Lin had ordered the secretary to investigate Su Nantian’s background—because he subconsciously felt Su Nantian concealed something. His timing was too perfect, fitting precisely what Nan Gong Lin needed at this moment.

The Tian Shui Building of the Nan Gong family had existed for so long, yet few individuals had returned to it. Su Nantian’s arrival was astonishing. Initially, he only displayed his martial arts skills, but after staying in the Nan Gong family for so long, he gradually revealed his intelligence. This made people suspect he had been concealing something from the start.

Thus, Nan Gong Lin must carefully verify him. Since he was entrusting such an important matter to this person, he needed to know everything about him. At present, Nan Gong Lin did not believe the information Su Nantian had provided initially.

As long as Su Nantian’s identity met his requirements, the entire burden of the Nan Gong family would be placed on him.

Meanwhile, Su Nantian and Nan Gong Yuyan returned to Nan Gong Yuyan’s villa. After all, the mainland port was under her responsibility, so Su Nantian had to report the results to his superior.

“You did well today; you made Father very happy. It seems there’s no need for my recommendation—your position in the Wu family will be directly assigned.”

Nan Gong Yuyan sat on her office chair, coldly staring at Su Nantian.

She hadn’t forgotten why Su Nantian had come to the Nan Gong family, and this time he had done so brilliantly, earning her father’s admiration. This made her feel threatened—Su Nantian was trying to escape her control and directly rely on Nan Gong Lin.

“Miss, what are you talking about? I did this for you, didn’t I? You’re the direct supervisor of the mainland port. If I did this well, your record would also look good.”

Su Nantian knew Nan Gong Yuyan’s cold expression was feigned. However, this didn’t mean her mood was good—she truly felt threatened, believing Su Nantian wanted to break free from her grasp. Thus, he had to appear loyal and devoted, ensuring she knew he didn’t intend to escape her control and climb directly.

Chapter 637: Further Steps

Su Nantian’s smooth words were meant to calm Nan Gong Yuyan. Yet she seemed unconvinced, casting a cold glance at him before sitting down and saying: “Your words are smooth, but if this success was done quietly, it would be my achievement. Now you’ve made such a show in front of Father—how can this success still be mine?”

“Miss, what are you talking about? It was you who recommended me to Father.”

Upon hearing this, Nan Gong Yuyan fell silent. At that time, Su Nantian had fully explained his plan to her without reservation.

Moreover, at that time, Su Nantian had intended for the plan to be credited entirely to Nan Gong Yuyan. He would merely execute it under her guidance.

But he hadn’t expected Nan Gong Yuyan to take the initiative and tell Nan Gong Lin that this plan was her own idea.

“I didn’t want to appropriate others’ achievements. This idea was originally yours, so it naturally belongs to you. If I had taken credit for it without telling Father the truth, wouldn’t that make me despicable?”

Nan Gong Yuyan thought for a while before saying this. At that time, she had indeed acted on impulse and told Nan Gong Lin the plan was Su Nantian’s.

“Then I truly appreciate your opportunity, Miss. However, please rest assured—although this time I’ve gained Father’s favor, I am still your man. Besides, I have a leverage over you; even if this task was done well and Father developed some admiration for me, I dare not fly too far with your grip on my weakness.”

Su Nantian’s words effectively subdued all of Nan Gong Yuyan’s worries. Previously, she had thought Su Nantian would bypass her and directly rely on Nan Gong Lin this time. But his words were correct—she always held his leverage, and even if he eventually obeyed Nan Gong Lin’s orders, she was Nan Gong Lin’s daughter. Nan Gong Lin would trust her over an outsider.

“Alright, stop your flattery. You’re not my man; you’re clearly Nan Gong Ping’s.”

Nan Gong Yuyan scolded Su Nantian but then shifted her tone: “But I must admit, your performance today was truly outstanding. I hadn’t expected this matter to be resolved so quickly. After all, shaking the mainland port’s structure was quite complex, but you did it in less than a week. I must admit I was impressed.”

Nan Gong Yuyan had no doubt about Su Nantian’s abilities. The mainland port, which hadn’t changed for years, was completely upended by him in under a week. The main factor was undoubtedly the Nan Gong family’s support, but no one else could have arranged this so swiftly.

“This is thanks to the Nan Gong family’s support behind us. I may have contributed, but I dare not take the majority.” Su Nantian said today with a humble demeanor. Only by doing so could he ensure Nan Gong Yuyan believed him without suspicion, preventing her from uncovering his true identity.

Although the information Nan Gong Yuyan received had no connection to his real identity, if Nan Gong Lin discovered this matter, Su Nantian’s true identity would be exposed.

“Good to know. Originally, I thought you did so well that I could directly approach Father to recommend you. But now it seems Father greatly admires you, so your brother’s matters will likely be assigned to you directly. No need for me to speak.”

But as she said this, Nan Gong Yuyan’s tone turned serious and continued: “However, I must warn you. If you’re saving people, I won’t say anything. But you must work diligently for the Nan Gong family. Don’t think that once you’re far from me, you can act recklessly. I consider you a talent and allowed you to stay in the Nan Gong family, but if you have ulterior motives toward the Nan Gong family, I will not hesitate to inform Father.”

Nan Gong Yuyan knew she had to intimidate Su Nantian; otherwise, he would truly believe she couldn’t control him.

“Rest assured, Miss. You already know why I came here. I have always been loyal to the Nan Gong family. Moreover, you said I hold a leverage over you—how could I act recklessly?”

Su Nantian spoke while smiling with a carefree expression.

Nan Gong Yuyan watched him and suddenly said: “When you go to the Wu family to rescue people, what will you do after? Will you leave the Nan Gong family?”

After asking this question, a brief flicker of sadness appeared in her eyes. However, she controlled her emotions well; this momentary change went unnoticed by Su Nantian.

Su Nantian didn’t know why Nan Gong Yuyan suddenly asked this question and shook his head: “I don’t know. It’s not in my plan yet. I’ll definitely rescue the people. But regardless of whether I want to stay or not, I must leave after rescuing them. After all, my family will definitely investigate their whereabouts. No matter what, it will be connected to Nan Gong Ping. I can’t stay here and involve you. Even if the Nan Gong family’s power surpasses the Wu family, if they stir up trouble, it will be difficult for the Nan Gong family to handle.”

Su Nantian’s plan was clear—he would leave the Nan Gong family after rescuing the people and escape from Beijing, ensuring the people’s safe return. His words now were to calm Nan Gong Yuyan.

“You’re right. No matter what, this won’t be fully concealed. The Wu family will definitely investigate the Nan Gong family. There will always be connections, so leaving the Nan Gong family is the best choice. This way, our family has no responsibility for this matter.”

After saying this, Nan Gong Yuyan felt a sudden emptiness in her heart. The mainland port issue was resolved, and Su Nantian would soon meet with Nan Gong Ping and the Wu family. He was now closer to his goal, meaning he would soon leave the Nan Gong family.

Chapter 638: Brushwork

Yet as Nan Gong Yuyan and Su Nantian had anticipated, it wasn’t long before Nan Gong Lin summoned Nan Gong Ping and Su Nantian to his study.

“Father, I’m here.” Nan Gong Ping said as he approached the man writing calligraphy.

“Master.” Su Nantian also addressed him and bowed slightly.

Nan Gong Lin didn’t respond but continued writing his calligraphy. The brush glided across the rice paper, revealing his deep calligraphic skills.

When he finished the last stroke, he smiled and set down the brush, admiring his own character.

The paper bore a large “忍” (patience).

“Good timing, come see how my calligraphy looks.” Nan Gong Lin smiled and waved to Nan Gong Ping.

Nan Gong Ping approached, feigning admiration for a while before raising his thumb and saying: “Your calligraphy skills have become even more refined, Father. Though I don’t understand calligraphy, I can see that this one is more expressive and carries a touch of elegance.”

“Hahahaha, you’re still sweet-talking. You don’t understand but always manage to please people.”

After speaking, Nan Gong Lin turned and looked at Su Nantian, then waved to him: “Nantian, come see. How is this character?”

This action surprised Nan Gong Ping; he hadn’t expected his father to call Su Nantian over.

After all, Su Nantian had only worked under Nan Gong Yuyan in the mainland port. His official role within their family was still that of a bodyguard, receiving a bodyguard’s salary and title.

But now his father had written this calligraphy and called Su Nantian over to view it. This was undoubtedly an acknowledgment of Su Nantian’s status within the Nan Gong family. A regular bodyguard would never be called over for such a purpose.

Nan Gong Ping felt relieved, as Su Nantian had now gained his father’s approval. This meant he could openly accompany him in business ventures.

Nan Gong Ping himself knew he lacked this ability, so he had long sought a trusted ally to assist him. However, Su Nantian’s role as a bodyguard meant he couldn’t always be informed of core matters. But now that Nan Gong Lin had acknowledged him, he could openly entrust Su Nantian with certain tasks.

Su Nantian approached a few steps and observed the character written by Nan Gong Lin on the rice paper.

To be honest, Su Nantian had no expertise in calligraphy, but the character itself was indeed well-written. Yet, there was a break in its brushwork.

“Master’s calligraphy is naturally exquisite, but I have no expertise in this field and can’t offer profound insights. I just find it beautiful.” Su Nantian thought for a moment before replying.

“Then why did you frown earlier?” Nan Gong Lin suddenly asked.

Hearing this, Su Nantian was startled. He had frowned when observing the character due to its uneven brushwork, but he quickly relaxed his brow. He hadn’t expected this detail would be noticed by Nan Gong Lin.

“Nothing in particular—just that Master’s strokes seemed uneven at first, so I frowned. But calligraphy is so profound that I couldn’t understand its meaning.”

Upon hearing Su Nantian’s words, Nan Gong Lin was momentarily stunned. The reason for his uneven brushwork was known only to himself.

It was because Nan Gong Lin had felt physically drained while writing the character, causing his strokes to be uneven and unable to complete the entire character in one go.

Thus, Nan Gong Lin knew his health was deteriorating; even writing a single character had become exhausting. Normally, he appeared composed and detached, but this was because he lacked the strength to handle other matters. He pretended to be a hands-off leader, but in reality, he was nearing his end.

“Hahahaha, enough. The calligraphy is done, and you two have arrived. Let’s discuss the real matter now.”

Nan Gong Lin smiled deliberately and changed the subject, indicating they sit in the study.

“I know why I called you two here. I’ve already told Nan Gong Ping that this collaboration with the Wu family requires your personal involvement. I’ve entrusted the mainland port to your sister, Nan Gong Yuyan. Now this collaboration with the Wu family is also entrusted to you. You should understand its meaning.”

Nan Gong Lin’s words were direct, clearly indicating this was a trial. Nan Gong Yuyan had already successfully completed her test at the mainland port, so this time, Nan Gong Ping’s collaboration with the Wu family must be handled well. Otherwise, their positions in Nan Gong Lin’s eyes would widen.

“Understood. I’ll do my best.” Nan Gong Ping nodded and replied.

But in truth, he had no confidence. This was his first time collaborating with another family. Though he had managed other businesses before, this was the first time dealing directly with a family head like Wu Chuan.

Although Wu Chuan wasn’t officially the Wu family’s patriarch, everyone assumed he held this position. After all, it was clear that the Wu family now relied on Wu Chuan’s support, with its true power still under his control.

“I know what you’re worried about. This collaboration is directly with Wu Chuan, a shrewd and cunning man to deal with. But you must understand this is an inevitable part of your growth, just like when I was young. Our family’s previous patriarch passed away too suddenly, and the burden fell on me abruptly. Could you avoid doing these things? If fear stops you from acting, our family would have already perished.”
