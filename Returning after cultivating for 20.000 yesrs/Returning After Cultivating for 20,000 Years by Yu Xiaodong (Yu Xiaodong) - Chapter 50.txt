"Besides you, no one thinks that old things are antiques," Su Nantian said, his voice laced with concern as he reiterated, "I'll say it again—what matters is the inner essence. Just focus on mastering these internal techniques."

Zhang Xiaojun dared not argue this time, nodding quickly to show he understood.

They finished most of the drinks they'd ordered. As the alcohol took effect, Zhang Xiaojun slurred, "Big Brother Tian, can you walk back? Should I...?" He attempted to stand but swayed and collapsed back into the sofa, "Should I send you home?"

Su Nantian shook his head in disdain, mentally marking a cross against Zhang Xiaojun's drinking capacity.

"Big Brother Tian!" Zhang Xiaojun began to chatter again, "That birthmark on our family's Mengyao is getting fainter. Do you think it's disappearing?" He gestured vaguely on his own face, but Su Nantian, fearing he might scratch himself, quickly pulled his hand away.

"It's fading," Su Nantian replied, "But if you keep acting like a drunkard, your face might end up scarred."

"Drunkard!" Zhang Xiaojun bounced on the sofa, grumbling, "I'm not being a drunkard! This wine is cursed—I feel dizzy."

In truth, Zhang Xiaojun's drinking capacity wasn't bad. But compared to Su Nantian, who seemed unaffected by alcohol, Zhang Xiaojun drank as if it were water.

Unbeknownst to him, Su Nantian's spiritual energy had already neutralized the alcohol upon contact with his body. Zhang Xiaojun, however, had consumed real alcohol.

Su Nantian sighed softly and placed the unopened bottles under the table, saying to Zhang Xiaojun who was searching for a bottle, "Stop drinking. I'll take you home. Where's the car key?"

"Car...car key?" Zhang Xiaojun slurred, fumbling through his pockets before producing an electric scooter key and handing it to Su Nantian with great reverence, "Big Brother Tian, this is my key. I only have this one vehicle! Please be careful driving."

Su Nantian stared at the key in his palm, furrowing his brow as he asked, "What kind of car is it?"

"An electric scooter!" Zhang Xiaojun declared proudly, his tone suggesting he was about to soar into the sky. Su Nantian quickly covered his mouth to muffle his outburst and hurriedly led him away.

Su Nantian slipped the key into his pocket, intending to hail a taxi later. He first helped Zhang Xiaojun to the bar's front desk to settle the bill.

With ease, he lifted Zhang Xiaojun and retrieved his wallet from his pocket, asking the receptionist, "Settle the bill."

The receptionist was taken aback and hadn't yet responded when a greasy middle-aged man approached from behind Su Nantian.

"Ah, Brother Su, why talk about money? You coming here gives our Feisi Bar prestige. How can you pay?" The man signaled the receptionist, who hesitated for a moment before slowly crouching down until he disappeared behind the counter.

"Didn't I recognize you as the owner of this bar?" Su Nantian didn't beat around the bush, refolding his wallet and placing it back in his pocket as he faced the middle-aged man. He had a vague recollection of him.

"Ah! I didn't expect Brother Su to remember me!" The greasy man feigned surprise, his expression clearly staged. To Su Nantian's eyes, it was overly theatrical.

"I've heard of you," Su Nantian said flatly. Though he had walked through the human world in his past life, even if it was long ago, he still recalled a few details.

Zhang Xiaojun, left aside, slumped over the counter as if completely drunk. Su Nantian frowned at his unconscious friend, a flicker of concern in his eyes.

The bar owner obviously noticed the close relationship between them and didn't wait for Su Nantian to assist. Instead, he took Zhang Xiaojun's arm and helped him up.

Su Nantian observed the owner's agile, plump body and raised an eyebrow. "My friend is drunk. I was going to take him home, but it seems you have something for me?"

"Hey!" The owner adjusted Zhang Xiaojun's arm over his neck and said humbly, "Don't call me 'boss' all the time. I'm Wang Feisi. Just call me that, no need for 'boss'—it's too formal."

Upon hearing the name, Su Nantian's expression shifted slightly. His mind flashed with several names, each causing a shiver.

Wang Feisi's plump body seemed insufficient to support the increasingly unstable Zhang Xiaojun. Before Su Nantian could speak, Wang Feisi pleaded, "Brother Su, what if we talk somewhere else?"

Wang Feisi shook his body, and Zhang Xiaojun groaned in discomfort.

"Fine," Su Nantian had no choice but to agree, effortlessly lifting the drunk Zhang Xiaojun from Wang Feisi's shoulder. The sight of his strength made Wang Feisi exclaim, "Brother Su truly has remarkable strength!"

Su Nantian said nothing more and nodded forward. "Lead the way."

"Of course," Wang Feisi's oily face twisted into a smile as he turned and led Su Nantian upstairs.

"We'll go to the room on the second floor. It's quiet and convenient for discussion," Wang Feisi chuckled, his eagerness barely concealed before Su Nantian's sharp eyes.

Yet Su Nantian, accustomed to "meeting the enemy head-on," paid no heed to Wang Feisi's ambiguous intentions. If necessary, he could take the whole place down with Zhang Xiaojun.

Under Wang Feisi's guidance, Su Nantian and the two of them ascended to the second floor. Recognizing the familiar decoration, Su Nantian raised an eyebrow and said, "This second-floor decor reminds me of a place I've seen before."

Wang Feisi was taken aback, then smiled. "Brother Su isn't from this industry, so you might not understand. In Fengcheng, most bars have similar second-floor decorations. It's natural to find it familiar."

Su Nantian wasn't concerned with details, knowing just enough. He had no patience to listen further. Wang Feisi noticed Su Nantian's growing impatience and shivered, abruptly falling silent.

The elevator quickly reached the second floor. Wang Feisi smiled sycophantically, gesturing Su Nantian to go ahead and warning him, "Watch your step."

Su Nantian found carrying Zhang Xiaojun inconvenient. He lifted him effortlessly and stepped out of the elevator. Wang Feisi hurried to his left, guiding Su Nantian.

Unlike the previous bar, the second floor had almost no visible security—only a few cleaning ladies pushing carts through the rooms.

When they arrived, the ladies nervously greeted them and hurriedly pushed their carts aside to clear a path for Su Nantian.

"Go on, find a clean room," Wang Feisi called over one of the cleaning ladies. She nodded and spoke with an accent, "Boss, there's a room here—just cleaned."

The lady fished out a set of shiny keys from her apron, searching anxiously. As soon as she found the right key, she said, "Go to work."

Wang Feisi waved her off. Su Nantian kicked the door open and carried Zhang Xiaojun into the room.

The cleaning lady hurried back to her colleagues. They whispered, "Did you see that handsome young man?"

"Yes, but he's not respectable—he got someone drunk."

"But the one he got drunk isn't as handsome as him."

"Who knows?" The lady shrugged, "Maybe that's what he likes."

The two ladies pushed their carts away, but the gossip about Su Nantian had just begun.

After placing the drunk Zhang Xiaojun on the soft bed, Su Nantian frowned at his sneakers and hesitated before pulling the blanket over him from head to toe.

Wang Feisi didn't bother discussing such trivial matters with Su Nantian. He ignored Su Nantian's actions and said sycophantically, "Now that this little brother is settled, come with me?"

"Can't we talk here?" Su Nantian was about to take off his jacket when Wang Feisi spoke, so he put his hands back down.

"It's not that I don't want to talk here," Wang Feisi's eyes carried a hint of desperation. Su Nantian glanced at the snoring Zhang Xiaojun and nodded.

"Then let's go," Su Nantian replied flatly.

Wang Feisi's joy flickered briefly before he led the way again. They took the elevator to the third floor.

The third floor's layout was no different from the second, which made Su Nantian feel a slight disappointment.

After several turns, Wang Feisi finally led Su Nantian to a room with an exterior that looked extremely luxurious. The door read "Nine Heavens."

Su Nantian's lips curled.

"Please," Wang Feisi opened the door, and Su Nantian stepped in as invited.

The room's decor was unique. Everything inside had an ancient style—a purple sandalwood bed with carvings, pearl-white jade curtains, and a large seashell screen.

"You've done well with this room," Su Nantian's slight disappointment was erased by the sandalwood scent on the table.

Wang Feisi, pleased with the compliment, looked like he'd won a prize, smiling, "I'm glad you like it. If you didn't, I'd have wasted the effort."

"What?" Su Nantian raised an eyebrow. "Did you arrange this specifically for me?"

Wang Feisi, under Su Nantian's gaze, felt uncomfortable and wiped his forehead. He made up an excuse, "I've wanted to meet you for a long time. I thought of this to accommodate your preferences."

Wang Feisi stepped inside, and Su Nantian followed. He noticed the soft white carpet on the floor and kicked its edge, revealing a series of jade stones beneath it.

This understated luxury pleased Su Nantian, and his attitude toward Wang Feisi softened slightly.

"I see you like this room. That's good. To be honest, this room will belong to you from now on. The only key is yours. How about it?" Wang Feisi smiled and placed a key in Su Nantian's palm.

The cold touch made Su Nantian wonder: what significant matter was Wang Feisi willing to spend a fortune on to win him over?

After glancing at the key, Su Nantian liked the room and took it.

Seeing Su Nantian take the key, Wang Feisi was even happier.

"Come on, sit here," Wang Feisi led Su Nantian to an old-style armchair. The chair was carved from fine wood and embedded with jade stones in its relief patterns, looking very luxurious. Due to the hard wooden material, it had a thick cushion. Su Nantian raised an eyebrow and sat down.

The cushion's softness was just right—too soft would be uncomfortable, too hard would be painful.

"You see, if anything's not good, let me know. I'll have them fix it," Wang Feisi smiled and rubbed his chin, sitting on the other chair. "This cushion is silk with eiderdown filling—absolutely comfortable."

"You're quite the big spender. That makes me more curious about what you want from me," Su Nantian said.

"You've misunderstood," Wang Feisi was taken aback, then smiled. "I've wanted to be friends with Brother Su for a long time. I finally had the chance to have tea with you..."

Wang Feisi picked up a high-quality purple clay teapot and filled Su Nantian's cup with fragrant tea. Instantly, the pleasant aroma of tea filled the room, intertwining with the incense from the nearby smoke. The blend created a comfortable scent that relaxed Su Nantian's nerves.

Chapter 239: A Small Gift

"Let's not talk about other things. You really know how to enjoy life," Su Nantian naturally accepted the tea cup Wang Feisi offered and took a sip. "Junshan Silver Needle."

Wang Feisi's eyes lit up, complimenting without hesitation, "Brother Su also likes this? It seems we share the same interests. Now that I've met you, I feel like we're meeting too late!"

Su Nantian didn't take Wang Feisi's flattery seriously. He felt as if the person before him was a thin sheet of paper, waiting to be pierced. Su Nantian naturally disliked such socializing.

He set down the purple clay teacup and showed a hint of impatience on his face.

Wang Feisi didn't know what he had said wrong, causing Su Nantian's expression to change. Wang Feisi licked his lips and smiled deeper, "Brother Su..."

Su Nantian shot him a glance. Wang Feisi shrank back, then mustered his courage and said, "I know you're confused about why I called you here. But I truly have no ill intentions. Not only did I give this room to Brother Su for rest, but also..."

Wang Feisi stretched his voice and smiled, "I've prepared a gift for Brother Su. I'm sure you'll like it."

Wang Feisi clapped his hands, and a soft rustling sound came from behind the seashell screen. Su Nantian's sharp ears immediately frowned and glanced over.

A slender, boneless figure slowly stepped out from behind the thick white seashell screen. The room's sandalwood incense filled it, making Su Nantian's vision slightly hazy.

The woman was very婀娜 (graceful), wearing a long dress made of gauze and silk. Her dark hair flowed with each step, like countless threads of emotion that captivated the heart.

Looking up, a pale face with slightly misty peach eyes mesmerized. Her lips were red and moist, inviting one to kiss her. She seemed untouched by makeup yet appeared like a painting in ink.

The woman never dared to look up at Su Nantian, only biting her lip and staring at the carpet beneath her feet.

"Come on, look up and let Brother Su see you," Wang Feisi hurriedly scolded the woman for her lack of manners.

But the woman didn't seem frightened. Her misty peach eyes became even more dewy, and she bit her lip again, making her lips slightly swollen.

The woman hesitated for a moment, as if deciding something. She slowly lifted her head to look at Su Nantian's direction. She was startled by Su Nantian's handsome face.

A flush of blood rushed to her pale face, giving her a touch of vitality.

"What do you mean?" Su Nantian looked away from the woman and asked flatly, "You're giving me a woman as a gift?"

Wang Feisi was taken aback. He was surprised that Su Nantian hadn't been seduced by the woman's beauty, but his experience made him smile. "Brother Su doesn't know the reason."

Wang Feisi looked at the woman and waved his hand, "Come here and sit next to Brother Su."

The woman blinked shyly. Her long lashes fluttered like butterfly wings, making Wang Feisi feel a slight itch.

The woman obediently took small steps and approached Su Nantian's seat, nodding at him before slowly sitting by his feet.

Su Nantian was also taken aback, then furrowed his brows. He looked at Wang Feisi and said, "Speak quickly."

Wang Feisi didn't delay any longer and explained hurriedly, "Please don't be in a hurry. Listen to me. This girl is beautiful—she's a beauty."

Wang Feisi pointed at the woman on the floor, wanting Su Nantian to look again. But Su Nantian still kept his eyes on Wang Feisi, clearly unwilling to waste time.

Wiping the sweat from his forehead, Wang Feisi quickly smiled again, "This girl is pitiful. Her name is Wang Feixue. She was once a happy person in a middle-class family. But her father, who ran a business, got addicted to gambling and ruined the family's business."

Su Nantian furrowed his brows tighter, but still didn't look at the woman.

The woman on the carpet naturally knew Su Nantian wasn't looking at her. Her self-esteem was hurt, and a tear silently slid down.

"Then this girl's mother was beaten to death by debt collectors. Her father had no money to pay and couldn't fight in court. The debt collectors repeatedly came to demand payment, forcing her father to sell her to a human trafficker and run off with his mistress."

"I have a good relationship with this human trafficker. When he found something good, he thought of me and sold this girl to me. After hearing about her background, I felt too sorry for her! I never forced her to do anything related to business."

At this point, Su Nantian laughed and said, "So you're using her to bribe me? Do you think I'm someone easily bribed, or are you just too confident in yourself?"

Su Nantian's voice gradually cooled down. His eyes were wrapped with a faint coldness, making Wang Feisi startled.

"You've investigated my preferences so thoroughly. Do you know I hate being looked down on like this?" Su Nantian stretched his long legs and lifted his chin. His eyes carried a sense of contempt that pressed down on Wang Feisi, making him unable to breathe.

But this bold Su Nantian was undoubtedly a great savior for Wang Feixue.

Wang Feixue looked to Wang Feisi with a pleading gaze. Her eyes' entreaty made Wang Feisi's face pale, and he forced himself to say, "You really misunderstood me, Brother Su. I truly wanted to be friends with you. As for Wang Feixue..."

Wang Feisi's eyes glanced at Wang Feixue and quickly turned away.

"This girl is too pitiful. She hasn't even had a peaceful day here before being noticed by a powerful and evil man. I heard this evil man has残害 several women!"

Hearing Wang Feisi's words, Wang Feixue's body trembled slightly.

This trembling caught Su Nantian's attention. He looked down at the woman kneeling by his feet, and his eyes carried a touch of investigation and confusion.

"So you brought her to me today to have me rescue her?" Su Nantian raised an eyebrow and cast a questioning gaze at Wang Feisi.

"Ha...," Wang Feisi's plan was exposed by Su Nantian, and he felt a bit embarrassed, scratching his head. "You know well enough that we in this business rely on one connection. This powerful and evil man is really too much for my small business to handle!"

Wang Feisi's anxious expression was a mess. He pleaded, "But you're different. We all know your achievements!"

Chapter 240: Wang Feixue

"What achievements?" Now it was Su Nantian's turn to be confused. His mind paused, then he thought of the two places he had taken down recently.

Sure enough, Wang Feisi smiled slyly, "The incident where you took down the two places in the north of the city is now known by everyone in this circle."

Wang Feisi said he was thirsty and took a sip of tea from the cup, continuing, "But even if you took down those places, it was just a brute's act. What made you famous was that you came out unscathed after the incident, which makes people dare not easily provoke you."

Su Nantian held the carved armrest of the old-style chair, snorted coldly, and didn't acknowledge or deny Wang Feisi's flattery.

Unexpectedly, Wang Feisi felt awkward and couldn't get his footing. But seeing the Su Nantian before him like a Buddha, Wang Feisi bit his lip and continued bravely, "The situation is this: it's the same thing. I really can't stand to see this girl being abused, but my Feisi Bar can't afford to provoke that powerful and evil person. After thinking it over, I only thought of you to save her from suffering."

Wang Feisi stood up from the chair, and the plush cushion immediately formed a large pit in the shape of a buttock.

He grabbed the woman on the floor and pulled her up, scaring the girl with a startled cry. She quickly looked to Su Nantian for help.

Wang Feisi pointed at Wang Feixue and said, "This girl is naturally a beauty. In two years, she might even surpass the current top female stars. To be honest, I couldn't bear to see this pitiful girl abused again. Also, I wanted to use this opportunity to get your help and protect my Feisi Bar."

Su Nantian ignored the girl's gaze again, looking at Wang Feisi's performance with a neutral expression.

"How can you be sure I have the ability to protect your Feisi Bar? The powerful and evil person you mentioned, I've never heard of him. Would you have me get involved in this mess just because of your words?"

Faced with Su Nantian's second refusal, Wang Feisi was desperate. Although giving Wang Feixue away could save the bar, he simultaneously lost both Wang Feixue and Su Nantian as his two王牌 (ace cards), which made him heartbroken.

After thinking it over, the best solution was to use Wang Feixue and keep Su Nantian as a big Buddha, allowing the bar to be protected from destruction.

"Brother Su," Wang Feisi said urgently, "If I hadn't thoroughly investigated you, I wouldn't have dared to make such a bold promise to protect."

"Stop talking. I've been in this circle for over ten years. I can tell the relationship between people at a glance."

Wang Feisi pushed Wang Feixue toward Su Nantian. She flew like a piece of down and gently fell at Su Nantian's feet.

Su Nantian only looked at her without changing his expression and said, "You brought me here, gave me a private room in your bar, and showed me a girl with a tragic background. Do you think I'll use my connections to protect you?"

"Do you think these two things combined are more important than my connections?"

Though it was a question, it came out of Su Nantian's mouth like a cold threat.

Wang Feisi didn't dare to speak anymore. The pressure from Su Nantian had already made him tremble.

Seeing Wang Feisi's retreat, Su Nantian snorted and got up to leave.

"Don't!" A sharp and painful female voice came from behind. Su Nantian hadn't even turned around when he felt his小腿 (shin) being hugged by a pair of slender hands. Then, a soft and warm body pressed against his shin.

This touch made Su Nantian's whole body tremble, and his Adam's apple rolled up and down.

Wang Feisi recovered from his shock and flashed a determined look, saying to Su Nantian, "This child probably has something to say to you. I've never seen her act like this before! Please listen carefully to what she has to say."

After saying that, Wang Feisi quickly disappeared from the room.

Su Nantian furrowed his brows. But since the woman was hugging his leg, he didn't dare to pull it out fear of hurting this delicate woman.

"What else do you want?" As time passed, Su Nantian finally couldn't help but ask, "What do you want to say?"

Wang Feixue didn't speak. She only bit her lip and trembled.

Su Nantian was impatient with people who couldn't say a word, but he also feared hurting the woman. He had no choice but to temporarily turn his back toward Wang Feixue.

Realizing Su Nantian's appearance of being held back, Wang Feixue instinctively loosened her arms around Su Nantian's leg.

Su Nantian was tall, and now Wang Feixue knelt on the floor. From Su Nantian's perspective, he could only see the top of her head.

He sighed and quietly crouched down to look Wang Feixue in the eyes. This direct gaze startled Su Nantian, as Wang Feixue was already crying and tightly biting her lower lip without making a sound.

Su Nantian felt a tremor in his heart at Wang Feixue's scene of tears and rain, generating a touch of compassion. He reached out to wipe the wet face of Wang Feixue.

Gently asked, "Why are you crying?"

Wang Feixue opened her mouth but, under Su Nantian's slightly puzzled gaze, she choked out, "Please... help me. I don't want to be caught by that evil man. Please help me."

Su Nantian fell silent and didn't reply.

Wang Feixue feared Su Nantian's refusal, quickly grabbing his sleeve and pleading, "I beg you. Save me! I'm willing to give my pure body to you. Just save me!"

Seeming a bit surprised, Su Nantian looked at Wang Feixue in disbelief.

"Can purity be given to anyone随意?" For some reason, Su Nantian felt a bit angry when he heard Wang Feixue say that. But when his eyes fell on this pitiful woman, his heart softened, and his temper didn't rise. Wang Feixue was frightened by Su Nantian's question.

The woman shivered and hesitated, trembling on the ground.

Sighing with a headache, Su Nantian pulled Wang Feixue up from the ground.

"Get up. Let's talk more calmly." Su Nantian led Wang Feixue to the chair, nodding toward it for her to sit.

Chapter 241: Vacuum

At that moment, Wang Feixue no longer resisted and obediently wiped her tears before slowly sitting down. This slow movement was like a painting, making Su Nantian's stomach tighten slightly.

"We can sit down and talk," Wang Feixue wiped her tears, but because she had cried so many times today, the woman's pale face still had a rosy hue, making her even more attractive.

"You're really an exquisite woman," Su Nantian suddenly said without thinking, causing Wang Feixue to be stunned. Her face's rosy hue became even more crimson.

Su Nantian put his hands in his pockets and looked down at Wang Feixue. Due to the angle, Wang Feixue's slightly rising chest was visible to Su Nantian.

Realizing his body's heat, Su Nantian didn't look any longer but instead turned around and sat down on his original seat.

After calming down, Wang Feixue kept glancing at Su Nantian's body, trying to figure out his thoughts. But since this woman was inexperienced, her small glances were clearly seen by Su Nantian.

"if you really want to look, just look carefully. I won't run away," Su Nantian felt like teasing this woman and said the words in his mind aloud.

Wang Feixue was embarrassed again. Her posture, which had just been seated, started to move uncomfortably. The high-quality silk material wrapped her delicate body, and she didn't need to speak to be incredibly alluring.

"I just want to know if you're willing to help me," Wang Feixue bit her lip and begged for the third time, having lost all her self-respect. Even so, Wang Feixue's heart had no intention of retreating.

At this point, she had no choice. Whether it was death or not, why not choose Su Nantian, a sunny and handsome person?

Su Nantian hadn't had any intention of helping Wang Feixue before. After all, Wang Feixue was a piece of jade tied to a rope by Wang Feisi to lure Su Nantian.

If he truly protected Wang Feixue, then this bar would inevitably fall under Su Nantian's control.

Su Nantian hadn't yet figured out Wang Feisi's personality or the bar's secrets, and he didn't want to rashly accept this unexpected burden. If something went wrong, it would be him cleaning up the mess.

Seeing Su Nantian's hesitation, Wang Feixue's tears that had just disappeared quickly returned. Her face's rosy hue faded, and she asked in disbelief, "You still don't want to?"

"I'll ask once more. Are you really willing for me to help you?" After thinking, Su Nantian lifted his eyes and looked at Wang Feixue. His expression was very serious, making Wang Feixue feel a sense of reliability.

Almost instantly, Wang Feixue slid off the chair and fell to the floor, crying out to Su Nantian, "I really am willing. Please help me!"

Compared to before, this time Wang Feixue's tone was much stronger. Su Nantian was her last lifeline, and she dared not let go.

Sighing, Su Nantian rubbed his nose and ignored the woman on the ground. He walked to the bed instead.

Wang Feixue, kneeling on the floor, kept her eyes fixed on Su Nantian's steps. When she saw him heading toward the big bed, her heart beat faster, feeling a strange sensation in her body.

Wang Feixue pretended to get up but hadn't even stood when she heard Su Nantian say, "I'll help you."

Wang Feixue was happy and finally smiled. Su Nantian even had a thought to praise her, as he thought the beauty of this girl was most beautiful when she cried. But this smile was like a thousand trees and ten thousand blossoms, making people yearn for it.

The girl's hands moved on her chest's gauze, as if waiting for Su Nantian to say something.

"Leave," Su Nantian turned away and didn't look at her. He was thinking about how to completely free this girl from the cage.

But this sentence made Wang Feixue cry again. Su Nantian "hissed" and turned around to look at her, saying, "I said I'll help you. Why are you crying?"

Su Nantian wasn't annoyed by women crying, but like most ordinary men, he didn't know how to comfort a weak and weeping woman. His tone had a slight impatience.

"I..." Wang Feixue realized she misunderstood, thinking Su Nantian had changed his mind.

"You said you'd help me. Naturally, I should stay to serve you. I've said it before—I'm willing to give my pure body to you, to thank you..." Wang Feixue's voice grew quieter, embarrassed and shy.

Su Nantian frowned. He had sat for too long, making his back uncomfortable.

The thought of sending Wang Feixue away was dispelled by the discomfort in his back.

"Can you massage?" Su Nantian stretched his body and asked, "Do you know how?"

Wang Feixue was taken aback but quickly nodded, "I can. I can."

After saying that, Wang Feixue ran over to Su Nantian, and her chest waves swayed with each movement.

Vacuum!

Su Nantian felt a surge of heat and quickly blocked out the thoughts in his mind.

Seeing Wang Feixue had arrived, Su Nantian didn't hesitate. His long fingers were on the buttons of his shirt and began to unfasten them one by one.

As each button came off, Su Nantian's jade-like chest was revealed halfway. The hard muscle lines made Wang Feixue shy and lower her head.

Su Nantian finished unfastening the buttons and took off his jacket and shirt.

With the sound of clothes falling, Su Nantian's golden proportion upper body was exposed. Wang Feixue felt even more nervous, and besides fear, there was a sense of joy.

Wang Feixue bit her lip. Her hands started to take off the gauze dress. Su Nantian noticed her strange behavior and quickly stopped her, "You don't need to take it off. Come and massage me."

Wang Feixue was filled with shame again, her mind overwhelmed by it. She trembled and felt blood flowing in reverse.

Su Nantian didn't care about that, and he stepped onto the bed with his long legs. To keep comfortable, Su Nantian took a pillow from the side and placed it under his head.

Chapter 242: Spring Light

Looking sideways at Wang Feixue standing by the bed, Su Nantian furrowed his brows.

"If you regret it now, you can still leave."

Wang Feixue's body trembled. A sense of frustration surged through her.

"Regret what?" She asked, "Regret not massaging you?"

Wang Feixue was like a feather carried by the wind, lightly getting on the bed. Compared to Su Nantian's lying down, she knelt on the bed.

The floor-to-ceiling window by the side had sunlight pouring in, evenly covering Su Nantian's back. The powerful muscles and white skin made Wang Feixue feel inferior.

A pair of soft hands emerged from the wide silk sleeves. Wang Feixue's hands were not very warm, and when they covered Su Nantian's back, they felt slightly cold. This made Su Nantian shiver.

"Sorry..." After the confusion, Wang Feixue quickly put her hands between her legs to warm them. When they weren't so cold, she covered them again, making Su Nantian let out a soft groan of comfort.

Wang Feixue seemed to have received approval. Her flexible hands pressed and pounded Su Nantian's back at times.
