It was the first time someone had dared to speak to him like that. Xu Wenhao stood frozen in place, until a subordinate poked his back with an elbow, reminding him: “Boss, he's leaving!”

“Wait!” At the subordinate’s reminder, Xu Wenhao finally snapped out of his stupor and hurried after Su Nantian. He intercepted Su Nantian’s path, blocking his way.

“Young man, you’ve got guts. Daring to take someone in front of me—do you even know who I am?”

“No need to ask. You can tell me who you are right now.”

Su Nantian cast him a cold glance, as if viewing him as trash. He held no regard for Xu Wenhao at all.

Even while confronting Xu Wenhao, Su Nantian kept Gao Jingjing behind him, determined to protect her.

Xu Wenhao chuckled, assuming Su Nantian was unaware of his identity and thus dared to act so boldly.

He waved a hand, signaling his subordinates. One of them said: “This is Xu Wenhao, the renowned figure in our city—someone you can’t afford to provoke.”

“What? Scared now? No one dares challenge me here.”

Xu Wenhao, seeing no reaction on Su Nantian’s face, assumed he was intimidated by his name and smiled smugly.

But no one expected Su Nantian to say: “So what? What does that matter?”

“So what? Young man, didn’t you hear me just now? This is a renowned young master in our city. What are you, that you dare to challenge him?”

Another subordinate, eager for glory, stepped forward and jabbed Su Nantian’s chest with his index finger. “You should know your place.”

Su Nantian had no intention of arguing with such people, but their actions were growing increasingly reckless. He was not a man of patience.

His eyes darkened, and the subordinate took several steps back in fear, his voice trembling. “You… what do you want to do?”

Before he could finish speaking, the subordinate was launched into the air and pinned to a tree branch.

The crowd gaped in disbelief, but only Su Nantian knew he had used a trivial technique. Indeed, humans on Earth were still so weak.

Thinking this, Su Nantian prepared to leave with Gao Jingjing. But Xu Wenhao still thought it was a coincidence and called out: “Why are you so protective of this woman? Do you also like her? I’ll tell you, she’s off-limits. She’s the one I’ve set my sights on!”

Su Nantian could no longer hold back. As he was about to speak, Gao Jingjing looked at him with concern.

“Don’t worry. What you should do is pray for them,” Su Nantian said, patting her hand on his arm to reassure her.

He approached Xu Wenhao and said: “I’m not a bad person, but I have one flaw—my love for justice. To oppress a woman and then slander her out of unrequited love is despicable, and I despise it.”

Xu Wenhao was startled by Su Nantian’s actions but forced himself to stay calm. “What are you playing at? If you’re so confident, let’s fight!”

Su Nantian was speechless. Why did people always resort to fighting over women?

“Fine! That’s what you said.” Su Nantian tilted his head, stretching his neck like a professional boxer.

“Boss, look at his stance—he seems serious. Should we retreat?” One subordinate whispered to Xu Wenhao.

Chapter 133: The Duel

It was obvious to all that Su Nantian’s stance resembled a master. Only those who knew boxing would move like this.

Xu Wenhao, always concerned with his image, could not afford to lose face. He slapped one of his subordinates: “Nonsense! If I leave now, it’s like running away. How will I survive afterwards?”

Su Nantian cracked his knuckles, intending to use a spell to eliminate them all at once. But if he did so, it would raise suspicion. Thus, he decided to settle the matter with fists—less likely to draw attention.

“Alright, have you made up your minds? I don’t have much time; I’m in a hurry. You’re wasting my life.”

Su Nantian glanced at his watch, then removed it and handed it to Gao Jingjing: “This is something very important to me. Please keep it for me.”

“Ah, okay.” Gao Jingjing had yet to recover from Su Nantian’s bold response and took the watch hesitantly, clutching it tightly.

Xu Wenhao saw Su Nantian standing nearby and gestured with a finger, an obvious provocation.

Xu Wenhao was never one to hold his temper. He despised being challenged and shouted: “Men! Attack!”

Under Xu Wenhao’s command, none of his subordinates hesitated. They all rushed forward in unison.

This left Gao Jingjing stunned, shouting: “Xu Wenhao! Fighting one against many is unfair!”

But Xu Wenhao ignored her, perhaps intentionally.

Su Nantian swung his fist and struck the first attacker under the chin. The man flew into the air in a perfect arc before landing on the ground.

Xu Wenhao and everyone else were stunned, staring at the unconscious man. He hadn’t even groaned; his jaw was already twisted to the side.

Some timid subordinates began to retreat, but Xu Wenhao barked: “What are you waiting for? Attack!”

“Ah!”

The group roared and charged again. Su Nantian delivered a left hook, a back elbow strike, and a back throw—all in one fluid motion. He didn’t even catch his breath, as if stretching.

After thirty seconds, Su Nantian stood over the fallen men and clapped his hands: “Who’s next? I’ll take them all on.”

This was twenty people. What kind of monster was this Su Nantian?

Xu Wenhao’s heart began to fear. He stood trembling, pointing at Su Nantian while backing away: “You… Su Nantian. Wait for me—I’ll find people to beat you down. If you have the guts, stay here.”

After saying this, Xu Wenhao felt he had created a safe distance and fled. Su Nantian shrugged indifferently: “Boring. I thought he was a tough guy, but he’s not even worth it.”

Gao Jingjing hadn’t processed what had happened. All she knew was that when she looked over, Xu Wenhao’s men were all lying on the ground, while Su Nantian was untouched.

Gao Jingjing happily approached Su Nantian and said: “Thank you, Nan Tian, for helping me today.”

“Xu Wenhao deserved it. He’s always flaunting his family background here. Now someone finally took him down. I wonder if he’ll dare to bother this place again.”

Among the onlookers were those who disliked Xu Wenhao’s behavior. Seeing Su Nantian teach him a lesson, some felt a strange sense of satisfaction.

But others began to worry. “Xu Wenhao is just a spoiled brat. He never fails to get what he wants. Now, because of this woman, he’s lost face. Do you think he’ll let it go?”

“What’s the problem? We still have this guy, right? When he comes back, he’ll definitely cause trouble. What’s it to us? This guy can fight—there’s no problem.”

Su Nantian heard the murmurs and knew they were all indifferent spectators. He didn’t bother arguing.

“Nothing to worry about. These people just aren’t tough.” Su Nantian replied to Gao Jingjing, who finally felt relieved. Suddenly remembering her watch, she politely handed it back to Su Nantian.

“Is it because they’re not tough or because you’re too strong?” As Su Nantian was about to leave, he heard a voice behind him. Turning around, he saw a good-looking man.

Gao Jingjing whispered: “This is another annoying fly—Yuan Ouming.”

Su Nantian nodded but ignored the man. Such people were beneath him, not even worthy of being ants.

Su Nantian took the watch from Gao Jingjing and carefully put it on. “Since Xu Wenhao has left, let’s go to school now.”

Su Nantian ignored the man and started to leave. But that annoying voice spoke again, as Gao Jingjing said: “He’s a fly.”

“Wait!”

Su Nantian looked at Yuan Ouming with disdain. “Look, it’s Yuan Ouming!”

“Seems like it! How did he end up here?”

As Yuan Oiming appeared, the girls screamed. He was their college’s top student! Even if he wasn’t as handsome as this man, it would still make them swoon.

“Hey, you’re crazy!” One girl couldn’t take it and smacked the other girl. “We’ve heard rumors that Yuan Oiming likes Gao Jingjing, but he never clarified it. No one knows for sure.”

Chapter 134: Storms Rise Again

“Unexpectedly, it’s true. I’m honored to witness this.” He said, eyes glowing with hearts.

Others were also excited because Yuan Oiming was the younger son of the Yuan family, who had always been indulged. After all, the Yuan family was a giant in the north, comparable to the Gao family. They were top-tier.

He had everything he wanted since childhood; no one dared defy a future heir. This upbringing fostered his arrogant personality, which was why he never clarified it—he believed that even if he didn’t say it, Gao Jingjing would eventually be his. The rumors alone were enough to keep others away.

But he hadn’t expected to see his ideal goddess with another man. He felt a slight anger. Who was this wild man daring to challenge him? Didn’t he know his worth?

He stepped forward, stopping just a few meters from Su Nantian and Gao Jingjing. He released his aura, trying to intimidate Su Nantian.

His low-pressure aura mixed with some power, causing people within several meters to flee. Some even fell to their knees.

Except for Su Nantian and Gao Jingjing, as Su Nantian was there, she felt no pressure. She just wished to vanish into the ground for being seen with these people today.

Su Nantian licked his lips, surprised to find this was a Qi Cultivation level three. But he didn’t care; killing him was as easy as squashing an ant. He wouldn’t even bother with children.

He turned his head slightly, smiling at Gao Jingjing. She blushed and didn’t know where to put her hands.

After a while, she timidly asked Su Nantian: “Nan Tian, are you okay? He seems pretty strong. His family is rich too…”

Su Nantian melted: “Do you know what men fear most? When women say they’re not good enough.”

Gao Jingjing was truly embarrassed and closed her mouth, secretly cursing Nan Tian for being a lecher.

Yuan Oiming was surprised. His aura hadn’t intimidated Su Nantian at all, as if it had no effect.

Was this man also a cultivator?

Yuan Oiming began to take him seriously, secretly checking his cultivation level. But he found nothing.

He relaxed and hummed a tune.

Suddenly, he saw his goddess interacting with another man. His eyes flashed with coldness, thinking about how to kill him to vent his anger.

But for now, he had more important matters. He waved his hand, and several luxury cars arrived with the back trunk full of roses and luxury items.

White, blue, black—blinding other girls’ eyes.

Yuan Oiming arrogantly lifted his chin and addressed Gao Jingjing: “Jingjing, be my girlfriend.”

“I can give you whatever you want. I’ll buy it for you.”

Gao Jingjing rolled her eyes. She had already lived a life others dreamed of since birth, so what did she need from him?

She ignored his words, leaving Yuan Oiming embarrassed.

But he wasn’t giving up. He kept talking: “Nowadays, people like the meaning of roses, right? These were specially flown in from Bulgaria for you.”

Gao Jingjing found it boring and didn’t even look. She never liked flowers anyway—she was tired of seeing them in her family’s business.

Su Nantian noticed Gao Jingjing’s impatience and thought this man was really tactless.

“I’ll kindly advise you to go back where you came from. It’s better for you to focus on your studies.”

Yuan Oiming sneered at Su Nantian’s advice, thinking he was just a bag carrier for Gao Jingjing.

“Did I ask you? You don’t even know who I am. I’m the second son of the Yuan family in the north!”

“Oh? I didn’t know that.”

Su Nantian said this and took out a cigarette, lighting it. The smoke dispersed with the wind.

Yuan Oiming saw this and was more convinced Su Nantian was a naive kid. He became even bolder.

“Let me enlighten you, young man. In Fengcheng, only the Gao family can match the Yuan family. Others are nothing!”

“Are you scared? It’s not too late to beg for mercy.”

Poor Yuan Oiming didn’t realize that Su Nantian was someone who even the Gao family patriarch would respect.

“Boss, why bother talking to him? He probably doesn’t understand.”

One of Yuan Oiming’s bald subordinates chuckled, showing his yellow teeth: “Just let us take him down and give us some oil to drink.”

He then greedily eyed Gao Jingjing with his tiny eyes. “Such a beautiful woman—just touching her would be worth dying!”

The bald man could already imagine Gao Jingjing under him at night. His lower part even lifted slightly.

“Hey, stay calm. You’ll enjoy it tonight!”

Yuan Oiming didn’t speak but slapped the bald man: “Damn it, can you even touch her?”

The bald man rubbed his red face and apologized, then called to the others. “Come on, brothers! Take him down!”

They all responded and took out sticks to attack Su Nantian.

Gao Jingjing, scared, trembled. Su Nantian squeezed her hand to reassure her it was okay.

This man had some spirit.

Su Nantian rubbed his chin, thinking this arrogant person was common. In the end, they all ended up begging for mercy.

He smiled and tossed his cigarette into the air. It spun gracefully before landing on the bald man’s clothes, burning a hole. The man was furious.

“I’ll kill you today!”

The bald man felt humiliated in front of his comrades and roared at Su Nantian. He grabbed an axe from the car’s passenger seat, its sharp blade glinting under the sun.

Chapter 135: The Hollow Joy of the Raven

Hah! How do you plan to leave alive?

Yuan Oiming frowned: “Baldie, don’t make it too bloody and scare Gao Jingjing.”

“Sure thing, boss. I’ll handle it.”

As he spoke, he rushed to Su Nantian and swung the axe down with intent to split him in two.

Just as the axe was three centimeters from Su Nantian’s nose, his eyes narrowed. He shifted slightly without panic and grabbed the bald man’s wrist with one hand.

Then, five fingers closed like a sword, wrapped in his inner energy, and grabbed the bald man’s wrist!

The speed was so fast that no one saw it. They only heard a scream: “Ah!”

That sound was worse than a pig being slaughtered. Upon closer inspection, the man’s hand had gone limp.

“My hand! My hand!”

The bald man could no longer hold the axe, which fell to the ground. His wrist had been broken by Su Nantian!

“Still confident, huh?” Su Nantian licked his lips and mocked.

“Why are you still standing there? Attack!” Yuan Oiming shouted at the others.

The subordinates finally reacted and, under Yuan Oiming’s pressure, reluctantly took sticks toward Su Nantian. But they stopped after a few steps.

Yuan Oiming’s face darkened and he stepped forward, scolding: “Don’t you want to live? If anyone disobeys, I’ll deal with them right here!”

Hearing this, they all abandoned their hesitation. Fleeing would be a death sentence.

They exchanged glances, seeing courage in each other’s eyes. They couldn’t believe they were outnumbered and couldn’t handle him!

They decided to surround Su Nantian and Gao Jingjing.

Su Nantian saw this and, fearing for Gao Jingjing’s safety, grabbed her and wrapped her in his clothes. “Keep your eyes open—don’t hurt my woman!”

“Otherwise, you’ll regret it!”

Hearing Su Nantian’s threat, they tensed. Under these circumstances, the chance of not hurting her was slim.

But how could they dare say that? Their clothes were soaked with sweat, and sweat rolled down their noses but no one dared to wipe it.

They feared falling into the same fate as the bald man!

Su Nantian watched their movements with amusement. These菜鸟 (newbies) who hadn’t even killed anyone were not worth his attention.

But he didn’t expect them to overstep, so he wouldn’t be polite!

They nodded at each other and swung their sticks.

“Pound! Pound! Pound!”

But no sound of sticks hitting bodies came. Instead, it was like hitting steel, and a woman’s scream.

They excitedly opened their eyes to see Su Nantian and Gao Jingjing still standing calmly before them!

The scream was just from Gao Jingjing’s shock.

Yuan Oiming’s subordinates saw their sticks and gaped. Then they all fell back, stunned.

Su Nantian’s attack was lightning fast.

He didn’t care, but Gao Jingjing was a real human. If she got hurt, he would be heartbroken and had promised the Gao family patriarch to protect her.

If something happened, his face would be ruined. But he had already scared them because these trash dared to provoke him!

“You’re really asking for it!”

Su Nantian’s eyes were cold, sharp, and full of killing intent. The others who hadn’t attacked yet looked at him with fear.

What they experienced next was something they would never understand!

They felt not a person but a mountain standing before them, pressing on their chests so much they couldn’t breathe or move.

*Thud!*

A整齐 (neat) sound echoed. They all fell to their knees, in perfect unison.

They heard the sound of their knees breaking but couldn’t even scream. Their bodies felt foreign to them.

Then Su Nantian smiled and stepped toward one of them, lifting his foot and stomping on his knee.

The already bleeding knee became even more gruesome. The man spat out blood, unable to utter a word of apology and fell unconscious.

The others who were still conscious wished for a quick death, but they couldn’t even die now.

Su Nantian was about to punish the next one when Gao Jingjing stopped him. He sighed internally; this girl was still too kind.

The world’s cruelty would eventually teach her.

Su Nantian coldly watched the kneeling men, who would have died if not for Gao Jingjing’s mercy. He snorted.

The men flew backward, crashing to the ground with a tremor in the earth. They regained movement and crawled away like dogs.

If there was a toilet now, they would jump in without hesitation.

“Caw! Caw! Caw!”

A raven’s call echoed from the sky. Gao Jingjing and Yuan Oiming looked up.

Su Nantian heard the sound and knew it was his death raven. He had left it at home, but why did it come back?

The death raven saw Su Nantian and swooped down, gripping his shoulder with its claws.

“Why are you here? I told you to stay home,” Su Nantian asked.

“Caw!” The death raven replied, but only Su Nantian could understand it.

“I sensed your anger and smelled death. I came to see if there was anything to gain.”

“Unexpectedly, it was a hollow joy. Why have you become so weak? You can’t even kill one person.”

The death raven stared at the men in blood, smiling greedily. Its saliva almost dripped onto Su Nantian’s clothes.

“Caw! Caw! Need my help?”

“No, this time it’s not your turn. I’ll compensate you next time.”

Su Nantian hadn’t expected this dead bird to be so greedy. It had come all the way for such a small amount of death.

Chapter 136: Two Tigers Fighting

After understanding Su Nantian’s meaning, the death raven looked deflated. It circled the sky reluctantly and flew away.

Without a meal, it seemed weak, wobbling in the air as if about to fall.

Su Nantian pointed a finger and shot a stream of energy into the death raven. “Caw! Caw!”

The death raven instantly regained vitality and flew away joyfully.

Yuan Oiming watched the man and bird exchange words, feeling郁闷 (depressed). He could tell it was a high-level spiritual companion.

Though his cultivation was only Qi Cultivation level three, his knowledge surpassed it. He had grown up in a big family and seen everything.

But this high-level spiritual companion was only something he had seen, never owned. He envied it deeply. How many times had he wished for such a companion to talk and share with?

But seeing his men rolling on the ground, his anger flared. Did this man not understand his identity and background? Why could he have a spiritual companion? Why could he stand by Gao Jingjing’s side? And why dare to fight back and injure his men?

But he felt no regret, only thinking they were useless trash who couldn’t even maintain appearances.

“Spit! Useless!”

As for Su Nantian, he was just skilled. He would surely be terrified when he used his ultimate technique!

At this moment, Yuan Oiming longed to teach Su Nantian a lesson, making him suffer and learn the truth: there are always higher beings beyond.

Yuan Oiming’s lips curled with coldness, his eyes flashing. He scanned the group before him.

He touched his suit pocket: “Ah, where is it? I had it before.”

“Oh! Found it!”

Su Nantian waited for him to reveal a secret treasure, maybe even getting something in return.

Gao Jingjing was tense beside him, worriedly watching Su Nantian.

Yuan Oiming pulled out a small hair gel from his pants pocket and sprayed it over his head. The pungent smell reached Su Nantian’s group, making them cover their noses.

“Ah-choo!” Gao Jingjing couldn’t hold it in and sneezed loudly.

Yuan Oiming adjusted his hair after applying the gel, pushing his flowing bangs to the side with a self-satisfied smile at Gao Jingjing.

Gao Jingjing, however, felt like she was seeing a fly showing off. A wave of nausea overtook her, and she buried her head in Su Nantian’s chest.

Yuan Oiming clearly saw the goddess’s attitude but couldn’t believe she was so intimate with this man. His anger surged uncontrollably.

“Die!”

“You really are stubborn! You must be regretting it now!”

Furious, Yuan Oiming slapped Su Nantian’s back.

Feeling a chill behind him, Su Nantian shifted slightly and let Yuan Oiming miss.

Yuan Oiming was stunned. How could this be? His “Tiger and Wolf Attack” was full of force! He had practiced it countless times, reaching perfection. How could an ordinary person dodge his fierce strike?

It must have been a coincidence!

As Yuan Oiming prepared to charge again, he noticed a group of people approaching.

Bad luck!

Yuan Oiming stopped abruptly and looked at who they were.

Su Nantian also watched them, as he had never regarded Yuan Oiming as a real opponent.

Dozens of black-clad men arrived, each with an imposing aura. They lined up in formation.

The leader was Xu Wenhao, who had just fled. He stood with his hands on his hips, pointing at Su Nantian to speak but saw Yuan Oiming instead.

His aura dropped significantly. His hands trembled as he thought: “Oh no… how did he end up here?”

It was the time for class, so more people gathered at the school gate.

Girls stopped to gossip while boys stood by indifferently.

Rich kid Xu Wenhao failed in his proposal and returned angry, only to meet the noble Yuan Oiming!

This intense scene was rare in a thousand years.

“I can’t believe it. Xu Wenhao is definitely dead this time!”

“Exactly! Who dares to challenge Yuan Oiming for the same woman?”

“He’s Yuan Oiming, but he’s really handsome!”

“Ah! Who is that? He looks more handsome!” Some girls noticed Su Nantian beside Gao Jingjing and screamed excitedly.

“Seems like it. Compared to him, Xu Wenhao is just trash! How dare he use roses at the school gate?”

Under these murmurs, the atmosphere became even more tense.

Cultivators’ hearing was much better than ordinary people’s, so the group’s conversation reached Su Nantian and Yuan Oiming clearly.

Yuan Oiming heard it, turned his head to look at the flowers on his car, and connected them with the roses mentioned.

It was because of this that Gao Jingjing didn’t value his flowers.

Someone must have given her a surprise first.

Yuan Oiming attributed all this to Xu Wenhao. If he hadn’t appeared, Gao Jingjing might have already been his. It wouldn’t be a waste of his longing for her.

Or maybe she was already under him now.

Thinking this, Yuan Oiming felt a tightness in his lower abdomen. His eyes could kill Xu Wenhao.

Xu Wenhao felt Yuan Oiming’s hostile gaze and wiped the sweat from his head, thinking about how to end it.

After hesitating, Xu Wenhao rubbed his hands and smiled at Yuan Oiming: “Yuan Ge? You’re here too?”

Yuan Oiming saw his oily body approaching and felt like seeing a maggot wriggling before him. He felt nauseous.

But his good upbringing kept him from exploding: “I was just looking for my goddess. What, are you going to challenge me?”

“Still, can you beat me?” Su Nantian said. “I’ll kindly advise you to go back now.”

Yuan Oiming was always direct, giving no face to Xu Wenhao.

Among the crowd, Xu Wenhao’s face turned red and white. No one had ever spoken to him like that, not even the martial arts club leader Long Huyan, who spoke politely to him.

Chapter 137: The Sadness of Xu Wenhao

Why did this kid dare to talk to him like that?

Plus, he had so many people behind him. There was no need to fear him. And his back was supported by the taekwondo club leader.

His confidence immediately grew.

“I won’t! Why can’t I chase her too?”

It was a joke. He had walked back several times, but this was the worst he’d ever done! Plus, all the students were here. Where would he put his face afterwards?

After saying this, he straightened his back and glanced at the back, noticing his people were still behind him. They hadn’t run away because of Yuan Oiming’s aura, so he secretly sighed in relief.

“Oh? Seems like you’re not afraid of dying!” Yuan Oiming said coldly.

Xu Wenhao felt a chill run through his body. He had sensed a dangerous aura, making him think Yuan Oiming really would kill him.

He regretted his earlier bravado. But it was too late to retreat now; he had to act fearless, or he wouldn’t have a face to stay in this school.

“I’ll tell you! The taekwondo club leader Long Huyan is my older brother! If you dare touch me today, he’ll make sure you can’t leave this school!”

Yuan Oiming heard this and smiled: “Do you think I care about who your older brother is? Besides, a taekwondo club leader isn’t worth my attention.”

Xu Wenhao turned red, staring at Yuan Oiming.

“Seems like you’re不服气 (disobedient)?”
