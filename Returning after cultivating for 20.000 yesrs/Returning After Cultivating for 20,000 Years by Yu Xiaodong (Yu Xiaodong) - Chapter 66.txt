Yue Xiaoshan found herself unable to eat after Tian Ke's words, but Su Nantian, seated beside her, cared little for such matters. Whatever dish arrived was swiftly devoured by him.

Observing the exquisite presentation, many students who had never dined in such a luxurious restaurant lamented their inability to savor the food before it was ruined. They could not openly reprimand Su Nantian, for if they waited a moment longer, the dishes would vanish entirely.

What was meant to be a heartwarming reunion of old classmates turned into a contest for food, while Yue Xiaoshan remained composed, her delicate chin resting on her hand as she watched Su Nantian devour his meal. One could not fathom what thoughts occupied her mind.

"By the way, Mr. Su, which department at Xin Yue Group do you work in?"

Tian Ke, despite Su Nantian's constant attention to Yue Xiaoshan during the meal, felt a surge of irritation. He continued to serve her dishes while asking.

"Oh, my job at Xin Yue Group is simple—wherever the leader goes, I follow. I spend half my day with them," Su Nantian replied, his mouth full as he snatched a morsel from Yue Xiaoshan's plate.

Chapter 317: Clashing Authority

"What... what is it?"

Tian Ke ignored his anger at Su Nantian's theft of his carefully chosen dish. Drawn by the lofty title, he inquired with curiosity, wondering if this unassuming man might be a more formidable figure than himself.

"It means bodyguard," Su Nantian said with disdain. "Mr. Tian, you really do have short hair and even shorter sight."

"Ha!"

The table erupted in laughter, everyone coughing and clenching their chests. Their gazes toward Su Nantian were complex.

"Kid, I thought you were something special, but it turns out you're just a bodyguard!"

After Su Nantian's explanation, Tian Ke nearly fell from his chair. He had not expected such a brash individual to be merely a bodyguard.

Seeing Su Nantian's serious expression, his mockery was evident: "A mere bodyguard? How dare you claim to work at the same company as Xiaoshan?"

"What's wrong with that? Shouldn't professions be ranked?" Su Nantian countered, wisely presenting a societal question to Tian Ke.

"Ha! None of that matters. What makes you think Xiaoshan would like you?"

Tian Ke's confidence was shaken by the fact that he had been outmaneuvered by a bodyguard. He resolved to humiliate Su Nantian thoroughly.

Tian Ke glanced at Yue Xiaoshan, who remained expressionless. She simply smiled at Su Nantian and said, "I like bodyguards."

"Uh..."

That retort left Tian Ke speechless. The others were equally stunned.

What a bizarre world! How could Yue Xiaoshan, an exquisite beauty, be smitten by a bodyguard? Some male classmates already contemplated quitting their jobs to pursue this promising career.

Hearing Yue Xiaoshan's casual reply, Tian Ke's teeth chattered. No wonder this kid looked like a starving ghost—perhaps he had never set foot in such an upscale restaurant.

"Ah, people really do differ by status. I suppose you rarely come to such high-end restaurants, right?"

Tian Ke suddenly found a way to mock Su Nantian. If he could constantly emphasize his lowly position, perhaps Yue Xiaoshan would eventually develop resentment toward him.

He was unaware of how crucial Su Nantian's role truly was—both as Yue Xiaoshan's bodyguard and a personal one. If he discovered the truth, he would be furious.

"Old classmates, after graduation, did any of you find good jobs?" Tian Ke deliberately steered the conversation toward work. His sly gaze kept flicking at Su Nantian, and Yue Xiaoshan immediately understood his intent.

Fortunately, Su Nantian was not one to waste energy on such a person. He simply ate in silence, showing no signs of annoyance.

"Ah, to be honest, I just opened a small shop. It's not too big—maybe two stars in size," Yang Dong was the first to speak, setting the tone for the conversation.

Men like Yang Dong would have gone unnoticed otherwise. After all, how could he be a boss? He must have received much help from Tian Ke.

"I did too. I recently passed an interview and now work at a company ranked in the top ten of Jiangcheng. My monthly salary is guaranteed to be over ten thousand yuan. Not bad, right?" Another male classmate spoke up defiantly.

"Cheh! What's that? I get more benefits in a year at a foreign company than your trash companies could manage in decades!"

At this point, a rotund male classmate's words caught Yue Xiaoshan's attention. To speak of powerful enterprises, Jiangcheng Xin Yue Group was undoubtedly the leader. Yet this man claimed their company was trash. It was impossible for her not to take it personally.

Seeing Yue Xiaoshan's expression change, Tian Ke thought she was impressed by the man's job. He decided to showcase his new company's prospects, claiming it would soon rank among Jiangcheng's top ten.

Tian Ke's grand speech about his company's future, Jiangcheng's economic development, and private enterprises driving public sectors painted a vivid picture of his second-tier company's ambitious blueprint.

His passionate speech successfully left Jiangcheng's top boss, Yue Xiaoshan, and the Dragon Group's number one bodyguard, Su Nantian, "astonished" into silence.

"Hah!"

After two minutes, Su Nantian finally couldn't hold back and let out a ten-second yawn. He looked at Tian Ke's speech with boredom.

"Good!"

When Tian Ke finished speaking, Su Nantian was the first to clap. Yet his eyes held mockery.

This kid thought he had intimidated Su Nantian, smiling with his eyes squinted.

"By the way, I forgot to ask—what does Xiaoshan do for work? I've heard you work at Xin Yue Group, but I didn't know your position."

Tian Ke suddenly remembered to ask. He wanted Yue Xiaoshan to reveal her role at Xin Yue Group, believing it would surpass Su Nantian's position as a bodyguard. This way, he hoped to instill self-doubt in Su Nantian and make him realize their differences, thus leaving quietly.

"I..."

Yue Xiaoshan disliked comparing herself with others. Otherwise, she wouldn't have kept her identity a secret this long.

She was about to say she was just an ordinary white-collar worker, but Su Nantian suddenly interjected: "She's our company's cleaner."

Su Nantian playfully winked at Yue Xiaoshan, who muttered "Boring" and gave him a big white eye.

"A cleaner? Uh... this cleaner is great. It's already impressive that Xin Yue Group employs such a person,"

The position of cleaner was indeed beyond Tian Ke's expectations, but he still smiled and praised it. However, upon thinking again, he realized Yue Xiaoshan couldn't possibly be a cleaner.

Seeing Su Nantian's amused expression, Tian Ke finally realized he was being mocked. He was nearly furious. Throughout his life, no one had ever dared to defy him—whether at home or in Jiangcheng's business circles. Yet now, he was being bullied by a mere bodyguard. If this became known, it would surely be laughed at in the circles.

"Enough! Let's eat. Eat!"

At this moment, Yang Dong stepped in to mediate. It was the first time he had seen Tian Ke so thoroughly outmaneuvered. To prevent Tian Ke from being further embarrassed by Su Nantian, he chose a strategy of retreat to neutralize the enemy.

Chapter 318: Open Hostilities

Tian Ke had been exhausted by Su Nantian's antics, but seeing Yang Dong secretly wink at him, he suddenly thought of something. His gaze toward Yue Xiaoshan and Su Nantian now carried sinister intent.

"Fine, I'll overlook your short-sightedness as a bodyguard for now,"

Tian Ke gave himself an exit, emphasizing the word "bodyguard" heavily, as if to remind everyone of Su Nantian's status.

"What does short-sightedness matter?"

But Su Nantian didn't seem willing to let Tian Ke off the hook. He smiled and wrapped his arm around Yue Xiaoshan's waist, instantly creating a tense atmosphere.

"You..."

Tian Ke's face changed. His entire body trembled with anger.

"Ah, everyone, let's not fight. There's a karaoke room in this private room. Let's sing some songs and order some beer,"

Yang Dong noticed the tension and stood up again, calling out to everyone.

Tian Ke's anger had somewhat eased upon hearing the mention of beer and drinks. However, a fleeting shadow in his eyes was caught by Su Nantian.

"Great! It's such a luxurious place. Not singing would be a waste of money!"

Liu Tong didn't want this old class reunion to turn into a verbal battle between Tian Ke and Su Nantian. She wanted to enjoy herself longer, take more photos, and show them off to her sisters later.

Yue Xiaoshan's classmates had grown tired of the awkward atmosphere and nodded in agreement.

Su Nantian didn't respond, nor did he leave with the few classmates who wanted to go. He simply followed Yue Xiaoshan.

This luxurious private room, as Yang Dong said, was a combination of restaurant and karaoke. When the sofas were folded up, a crystal screen descended slowly. At the same time, the lights dimmed, and even the neon lights around the room flickered on automatically.

Su Nantian glanced around and muttered, "Wow, high-tech."

Tian Ke caught Su Nantian's expression. Whether it was surprise or something else, he smiled mockingly. A country bumpkin—first time seeing such a grand scene, afraid, right?

Thinking this, the expression that had been somewhat unpleasant on his face eased. He felt he had finally gained an upper hand over Su Nantian in terms of knowledge, and a sense of smugness filled him.

Su Nantian noticed Tian Ke's laughter after looking at himself, and he silently cursed Yue Xiaoshan's brainless fan's intelligence.

When everyone was ready to sit down, Su Nantian walked over unceremoniously and pushed aside a male classmate who wanted to sit beside Yue Xiaoshan. He ignored the man's disdainful and resentful gaze, sitting down right next to Yue Xiaoshan.

"Why didn't you leave earlier?"

Yue Xiaoshan noticed Su Nantian's deep gaze, which was fixed on the classmates singing in the center of the room. She suddenly felt a stir and handed him a drink, asking casually.

"Nothing special. You finally had a break, so I naturally have to accompany you!"

Su Nantian looked at Tian Ke's sinister gaze in the corner and opened his drink.

"Cheh, what's this break? If this is what you call a break, I'd rather work until death!"

Yue Xiaoshan frowned. She didn't notice that Su Nantian's eyes held coldness when he looked at others, giving a sense of "everyone else is drunk while I'm sober."

Tian Ke monopolized the microphone, singing emotional songs with a heartbroken expression toward Yue Xiaoshan.

Yet Yue Xiaoshan showed no interest in his self-proclaimed beautiful singing, even ignoring him completely while listening to Su Nantian's jokes and laughing quietly.

"Damn kid!"

Tian Ke clenched his fists, biting his teeth tightly. He thought for a moment and gave Yang Dong a meaningful glance. The dog follower understood immediately and nodded.

"Ah, Yue Xiaoshan, don't just drink beverages. It's such a rare opportunity to meet up again. Everyone else is drinking, but you're the only one who just drinks beverages. Are you not giving us old classmates face?"

Yang Dong said this and brought two bottles of beer over, placing them on the table in front of Yue Xiaoshan.

After hearing his words, Su Nantian looked at the drink he had been sipping since the beginning and fell into deep thought. Was I not a person?

Looking at Yang Dong's lecherous smile and the drunken classmates on the other side, Yue Xiaoshan wanted to say she didn't really want to give them face. But after hesitating, she stopped that thought.

As Yang Dong said, they were classmates. Although Yue Xiaoshan didn't want to have any deep connections with them, she still had a little bit of classmate sentiment among them.

"Then okay!"

In fact, she rarely drank during social occasions. After all, as a top figure in Jiangcheng, who would dare to have her drink for business negotiations? Today was one of the few times she had touched alcohol in years.

But she didn't want to drink with these people here. Deep down, she wanted to have a drink with Su Nantian alone.

"That's better,"

Tian Ke stepped forward at the right moment, trying to hand Yue Xiaoshan his glass of wine.

Just as Yue Xiaoshan reached out and was about to touch Tian Ke's glass, Su Nantian suddenly leaned over and snatched the glass.

Su Nantian didn't want to disturb Yue Xiaoshan's reunion with classmates, but Tian Ke's purposeful smile made him uncomfortable. Seeing Yue Xiaoshan's slight frown from the alcohol, he became even more angry.

"What do you mean by that?"

Seeing Su Nantian interrupting his plans again, Tian Ke's face immediately turned sour.

"Xiaoshan can't drink alcohol."

Su Nantian placed the glass on the table and coldly replied. Upon hearing this, some classmates who had wanted to drink with the goddess retreated awkwardly.

"Ha! She didn't say a word, so why are you meddling? I'm going to force her to drink it!"

But Tian Ke wasn't someone easy to talk to. After Su Nantian had rebuked him in front of the goddess, he suddenly turned serious and took another empty glass, poured wine into it, and handed it to Yue Xiaoshan.

"I said she can't drink. Are you deaf or stupid?"

Suddenly, Su Nantian raised his head and a violent aura flashed in his eyes. He didn't need to play tricks with these small fry; brute force was enough to solve the problem. If Tian Ke didn't know how to behave, he wouldn't mind giving him a lesson.

Chapter 319: Fighting

"You..."

Tian Ke was startled by Su Nantian's sudden change. But thinking of Yue Xiaoshan's beautiful face and figure, as well as Su Nantian's previous disruptions of his plans, his expression darkened.

"Kid, you've been causing trouble at our class reunion. Now I'm just asking Xiaoshan to have a drink. What's it got to do with you, an outsider?"

Tian Ke said this and tried to forcibly put the glass into Yue Xiaoshan's hand.

At that moment, Su Nantian quickly snatched the glass and, before anyone could react, poured it over Tian Ke's oiled hair.

"I'm Xiaoshan's boyfriend. What business is it of yours?"

Su Nantian looked at Tian Ke, who was stunned, and smiled playfully.

Hearing this, Tian Ke felt an immense humiliation. His expression immediately turned dark, almost as if ink was dripping from his face.

He angrily wiped his face and shouted: "You, an ignorant bodyguard, dare to talk to me like this? I'll kill you today!"

Furious, he grabbed a beer bottle from the table and swung it at Su Nantian's head without hesitation.

This explosive power, if it hit, would not only split Su Nantian's head open but also溅射 glass shards onto Yue Xiaoshan beside him.

"Hmph."

Seeing the opponent's lack of restraint, Su Nantian narrowed his eyes. Tian Ke's speed was too slow for him. He grabbed Tian Ke's wrist with one hand and exerted force.

Crack.

"Ah! You dead bodyguard, let go of me!"

With a sound of dislocated bones, Tian Ke held his arm and screamed in pain. This scream made the other classmates notice the situation and gather around.

Seeing Tian Ke's cowardly appearance, Su Nantian felt a wave of nausea. He first released his grip on the man's wrist, then caught the falling beer bottle with one hand and exerted force.

Smack.

The entire bottle shot out like a bullet, smashing against the wall behind Tian Ke and shattering into pieces.

Silence. A deathly silence. The entire private room fell silent instantly.

Su Nantian's move had stunned everyone. He coldly surveyed the people around him and was about to leave with Yue Xiaoshan when a male classmate who got along well with Tian Ke suddenly stood up and shouted: "Hey! How dare you hit people!"

Su Nantian turned around and scared the kid away with one glance. He found the man's words amusing: "You really are dogs and humans together. It was this madman who started it first, and if I didn't fight back, I would have already gone to heaven to see the angels."

Tian Ke saw someone standing up to help him. His sly eyes quickly turned and came up with a plan. He immediately hugged his arm and shouted loudly.

"No! You were the one who started it first. I was just giving Xiaoshan a toast, and he not only refused but also attacked me. What kind of justice is this?"

After hearing Tian Ke's explanation, the classmates' gazes turned strange. Everyone knew that he had already said he didn't want Yue Xiaoshan to drink, yet he insisted on showing off and now was beaten. Who would dare blame others?

But they could only think this in their hearts, as Tian Ke's family was large and his business was substantial. He indeed had the capital to act like this.

"Tian Ke, I warn you not to go too far,"

At this moment, Yue Xiaoshan, who had been silent all along, suddenly exploded. She coldly glanced at Tian Ke, and everyone knew that Su Nantian had been criticized for protecting her.

Seeing the coldness in Yue Xiaoshan's eyes, Tian Ke felt a surge of anger. If it weren't for this kid, he would have already succeeded. Now he was forced to fight with Yue Xiaoshan.

"Ha! Kid, you'll pay a heavy price for your actions!"

Tian Ke smiled sinisterly and turned to the classmates, issuing orders: "Classmates, let's teach this violent person who disrupted our class reunion a lesson. Don't let him leave so easily. If you're men, help me teach him! I'll give each of you one ten thousand yuan!"

He knew the nature of his classmates and thus offered a high reward.

Originally hesitant classmates, upon hearing Tian Ke's words, immediately changed their expressions to fierce and determined, rubbing their hands and approaching Su Nantian.

"Chen Zimin, Wu Gui, Wang Bo, what are you doing?"

Yue Xiaoshan looked at her former classmates, who now wanted to use violence against her. Her brows furrowed into a deep knot as she coldly questioned them.

"Hey, Xiaoshan classmate, don't take it personally. We just want to clean this person out of our reunion!"

One male classmate said with a sly smile. After all, ten thousand yuan was his two months' salary. Even if Su Nantian's skills were good, he couldn't fight against so many people.

Yue Xiaoshan coldly said: "Then clean me out too. I warn you not to act recklessly—it's for your own good!"

She wasn't afraid of Su Nantian being attacked. After experiencing so many incidents, she had a detailed understanding of Su Nantian's skills. At least, these people who were just eating and drinking couldn't beat him.

Upon thinking this through, she truly was doing them a favor. Unfortunately, the classmates who were blinded by money completely ignored her advice.

Yue Xiaoshan sighed slowly as she watched those male classmates who had ignored her kind warning. She gave Su Nantian a subtle glance, indicating he shouldn't fight too hard. Su Nantian understood and winked at her.

"You guys hurry up! Beat this ignorant kid!"

Tian Ke, seeing Su Nantian and Yue Xiaoshan still had time to exchange glances, was furious. He shouted at the classmates who were ready to fight.

"Hey, you talk too much."

Su Nantian stretched his arms and stepped over the crowd. He kicked Tian Ke, who was shouting in place, onto the sofa. Tian Ke didn't even have time to scream before he fell into the sofa's gap and struggled.

"You dare to hit Ke!"

Dog follower Yang Dong was still loyal at this critical moment. Seeing Tian Ke attacked again, he didn't hesitate and rushed forward. The result was predictable—he fell to the ground in two seconds.

Su Nantian looked at the approaching crowd and calmly let Yue Xiaoshan sit down, then ran his hand through her smooth hair.

Chapter 320: One Against Ten

He then narrowed his eyes and grabbed a cushion from the sofa, using it as a weapon.

The light cushion in his hands almost turned into a blur. A few dull sounds were heard, and three male classmates who had rushed forward fell to the ground.

His explosive power was beyond these people's comprehension. Even if he picked up any object as a weapon, it would be far superior to these drunkards.

Yang Dong pulled Tian Ke out of the sofa. Tian Ke looked at his classmates who were beaten and tortured by Su Nantian, his eyes filled with more hatred. He estimated that Su Nantian could fight, but he hadn't expected him to be able to fight ten against one.

"Ke, this kid is too strong,"

Yang Dong, seeing Su Nantian's cushion-like attack that defeated more than ten people, said with trembling legs: "He really is strong."

"Hmph. What good is it to be so strong? A mere bodyguard dares to fight with us? I'll call Hu Ge now and have him deal with this ignorant kid!"

Tian Ke said these words while twisting his face, pulling out his phone from his pocket and dialing a number.

"Hu Ge?"

Hearing this name, Yang Dong's heart stirred. Could Tian Ke's so-called Hu Ge be the famous大哥 in Jiangcheng's underworld?

If Tian Ke called him over, Su Nantian wouldn't just be beaten. At least he would lose an arm or a leg. But thinking again about Su Nantian's arrogant face, he felt it was good for the kid to learn a lesson.

Bang bang.

The money-driven male classmates kept falling to the ground, and Su Nantian didn't want to hurt anyone. He hadn't hit hard because Yue Xiaoshan had instructed him not to, as they were classmates and it hadn't come to the point of fighting.

"Hey, your classmate's feelings are really deep,"

Su Nantian frowned and watched the classmates who had picked up beer bottles as weapons: "It's really excessive."

He let out a cold laugh and threw the cushion to the ground. He ran his hand through Yue Xiaoshan's hair, but this action again provoked the crowd's anger. One of them even directly swung a beer bottle at him.

Smack!

Su Nantian extended his right fist and met the beer bottle head-on. The bottle exploded with a loud sound, instantly disintegrating. He didn't even blink his eyes; the only thing on his fist was a slight redness.

But that classmate suffered. The shattered beer bottle fragments scattered, and several pieces scraped across his face, leaving a few bloodstains.

"Ah! It hurts!"

The seemingly strong male classmate let out a series of screams.

"What? Come on, keep coming!"

Su Nantian shook his slightly numb fist and smiled at the crowd who had taken a step back. His punch had truly intimidated them.

Seeing this, they hesitated. After all, they could help Tian Ke fight Su Nantian for ten thousand yuan, but they hadn't reached the point of risking their lives. Tian Ke's family was large and his business substantial; even if something happened, he wouldn't care about these small soldiers.

After weighing the pros and cons, they all put down their weapons and looked at Su Nantian with suspicion.

"You!"

Tian Ke glared at these fence-sitters with anger, but it was useless. This was a world of the strong and weak. Su Nantian had won everything with his fists.

"Ke, this kid is too strong. We should retreat," one male classmate suggested with his teeth clenched.

Others nodded in agreement: "Yes, let's leave quickly."

"Ha! Mr. Tian, if there's nothing else, I'll take Xiaoshan and leave now."

Su Nantian didn't want Yue Xiaoshan to stay in this place any longer. He winked at Tian Ke and smiled triumphantly.

Su Nantian's smile was like a sharp thorn, piercing Tian Ke's heart. He watched the phone that still hadn't moved and felt a bit impatient.

What if he told Su Nantian to wait, that the people he called would arrive soon? That didn't fit reality. But stopping Su Nantian, who could fight ten against one, was even more unrealistic. So he could only stare wide-eyed and watch Su Nantian leave the private room with Yue Xiaoshan, completely helpless.

"Damn it!"

Just as Tian Ke was about to lose hope, his phone suddenly rang. This kid's joy was so intense he pressed the answer key: "Hey, Hu Ge, you're here?!"

"Yes, I'm already preparing to enter the lobby..." A sinister voice came from the phone. It sounded very unfeeling.

"Good, that kid just left. Wait for me in the lobby. I'll be there right away!" Tian Ke said while calling his classmates to watch the show.

Su Nantian had just left, and maybe he could meet Hu Ge. Then Hu Ge would deal with him, and then take Yue Xiaoshan back. That way, he could regain his prestige in front of these classmates!

"Ke, what are we going to do?" One male classmate asked while walking in the corridor.

"Hey, you guys are such cowards. Let me tell you, this kid's arms will be broken by Ke!"

Yang Dong wouldn't miss such an opportunity to flatter. He smiled and whispered to the crowd: "Our Ke has invited the street's Hu Ge to back him up. He's already arrived at the lobby."

"You should have heard of Hu Ge's name before, right? Not only is he terrifying in appearance, but he's also ruthless when dealing with people. Once Hu Ge gets involved, it'll end in broken arms and legs!"

"Is that true? I didn't expect this so-called fierce Hu Ge to be the大哥 in the underworld! I never thought Ke's business ability was so strong, and he also has such connections in society!"

Because they were afraid of being blamed by Tian Ke, the few male classmates who had been beaten nodded in agreement and started to flatter. They also took advantage of the opportunity to become sycophants.

Actually, they were right. People in business do need to be involved with both sides. At least, they wouldn't dare to provoke someone like Hu Ge, a street boss.

"Ke's mighty! This time I'll teach that kid a lesson and let the mistress know who is truly the man!"

Some male classmates who had some experience in society, upon hearing that Tian Ke also had connections with Hu Ge, nodded and smiled while flattery.

"Ha! Of course. Today I'll let this kid know what it means to have people above you and teach him a lesson!"

At this point, thinking of Yue Xiaoshan's gaze when she saw Su Nantian defeated and admired him, Tian Ke quickened his steps.

Chapter 321: Walking into the Gunfire

Two minutes later, Tian Ke's group arrived at the lobby with a triumphant air. However, when they saw what was happening in the lobby, they all froze.

Like a scene from a drama, Tian Ke's so-called Hu Ge had indeed met Su Nantian and Yue Xiaoshan at the front desk. But their collision was completely unexpected.

There was no scene of Hu Ge throwing Su Nantian to the ground and teaching him a lesson, nor was there Su Nantian kneeling and begging for mercy. Instead, it was a harmonious situation.

Su Nantian looked at the leopard Hu Ge and his subordinates holding baseball bats and pipes with a mocking smile. He said, "Hey, Garfield, what's up? Are you coming to eat too?"

Indeed, the so-called street boss Tian Ke had called was the leopard Hu Ge, who had been taught a lesson by Su Nantian on the street.

Clang.

The pipe in Hu Ge's hand fell to the ground. He instinctively covered his pants, fearing Su Nantian would take advantage of his momentary lapse to reveal his Garfield.

"I... I, you..."

The so-called Hu Ge in Tian Ke's mind stammered before Su Nantian.

"I'm Su Nantian. I just said hello, is that so bad?"

Su Nantian felt a bit exasperated. He had already been so low-key, yet his intimidating aura remained as strong as ever.

"Su, no... Tian, Tian Ge, you're so elegant today. Coming to such a place for dinner!"

Hu Ge remembered seeing him just a few days ago at that cheap street food stall. He hadn't expected to meet him again in this five-star hotel.

Seeing Yue Xiaoshan beside Su Nantian, his expression became even more complex. He had originally wanted to take revenge on Su Nantian and, after much effort using his connections in Jiangcheng, had learned of their identities.

That night he almost couldn't sleep from fear. There was the story of an emperor traveling incognito, and now there was Jiangcheng's top female billionaire coming to eat at a street food stall. The thought of trying to provoke the tiger made him shiver with cold fear.

Clearly, he had already known Yue Xiaoshan and Su Nantian's identities. Seeing Yue Xiaoshan again, especially Su Nantian, his feelings could only be described as falling into an icy pit.

Such opponents who couldn't match in power or fight were ones he had vowed never to have any contact with. Yet today, because he was helping a little brother, he had run into them again.

"Ah, just something to eat. Nothing much, we'll leave now."

Su Nantian didn't want to waste much time on Hu Ge. This kind of person wasn't even worthy of his shoes.

"Ah, okay! Tian Ge, take care!"

Hu Ge was happy upon hearing Su Nantian didn't intend to trouble him. But just as he felt relieved that they were leaving, a terrifying voice suddenly came from behind them: "Hu Ge! It's this kid, don't let him go!"

Tian Ke saw Su Nantian about to leave with Yue Xiaoshan and thought that was unacceptable. He didn't think about why Hu Ge had been so submissive to Su Nantian earlier and shouted loudly.

This shout didn't make Su Nantian stop, but it almost made Hu Ge stagger and fall to the ground.

"Shut up! You idiot!"

Hu Ge looked at Su Nantian and wore an expression of helplessness. He finally understood what it meant to have a pig teammate.

Upon hearing Hu Ge's angry voice, Su Nantian stopped and looked at Hu Ge and Tian Ke with a smile.

His sharp mind immediately thought of a possibility, so he smiled: "What's wrong? Do you know each other?"

"No, we don't... "

Hu Ge quickly waved his hands to deny it. However, a loud laugh from Tian Ke immediately followed.

"Ha! You also know Hu Ge? Tell you the truth, he's the one I called to deal with you!"

Tian Ke saw Su Nantian's expression, thinking he had been intimidated by his connections.

Looking at Yue Xiaoshan's strange expression as well, he felt happy. Perhaps Yue Xiaoshan also knew Hu Ge? That would make things easier!

Tian Ke thought, placing his hand on the shoulder of the fleeing Hu Ge and deliberately showing a familiar relationship. Hu Ge was desperate.

"What do you think, Xiaoshan? Now you know my strength, right? Following this stinkard won't get you anywhere. Why not follow me today? I can even introduce you to Hu Ge!"

Su Nantian and Yue Xiaoshan suppressed their laughter, exchanging a glance. It was clear they had become more in sync with each other.

"What's he saying?" Su Nantian asked Yue Xiaoshan, widening his eyes.

"I don't know either."

Yue Xiaoshan frowned. There was truly someone like Tian Ke with such low intelligence, and he had been her classmate for four years. Indeed, society was a big melting pot.

Smack!

Hearing Tian Ke's increasingly outrageous words, especially when he mentioned Yue Xiaoshan, Hu Ge could no longer tolerate this pig teammate and slapped him across the face.

"Hu Ge? Why did you hit me?" Tian Ke covered his swollen cheek and asked, confused.

"I hit you!" Hu Ge looked at Su Nantian approaching and shouted angrily in a low voice.

"Oh, I see. Do you also like this beauty? If you can help me teach this kid a lesson, I can let you taste it first!"
