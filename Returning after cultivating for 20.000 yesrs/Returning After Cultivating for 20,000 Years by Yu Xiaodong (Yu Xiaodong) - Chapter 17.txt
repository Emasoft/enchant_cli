As Su Nantian prepared to continue tormenting Huang Dudu, Zhang Xue arrived.
"Damn! It's really her!"
Su Nantian realized that his careless words had come true.
Zhang Xue had previously been gazing at Su Nantian with starry eyes, infatuated.
Yet now that she had met him in person, she still wore a scowl.
"Why did I offend her again? She's such a forgetful tsundere girl! I saved you not long ago!"
Su Nantian muttered in frustration.
After Zhang Xue got out of the car, she ignored Su Nantian and directly asked Huang Dudu, who was still bruised: "Did you file the report? Tell me what happened."
She thought this lecherous man must have provoked that annoying person and then cried out for help.
But she hadn't realized she had instinctively aligned with Su Nantian.
"Report, report! I-I..."
Huang Dudu was a coward who had been thoroughly frightened by Su Nantian.
He no longer had the heart to glance at the magnificent figure of the female inspector before him.
This monster was too cruel; he hadn't told him how to explain things to the inspector.
It was impossible to blame Su Nantian.
Huang Dudu had truly dug his own grave.
"You what? You filed the report! Now you're stammering—do you think the inspection team is a laundry service? Summon them and send them away at will?"
Zhang Xue's brows furrowed as she raged.
"Hahahaha, Miss Zhang, don't be so impatient! Let this scumbag catch his breath before telling you. You've already scared him!"
You ignored me, so I'll tease you a bit.
The immortal master of ten thousand years now played childish tricks like this.
Seeing Su Nantian apparently knew the female inspector, and was even speaking to her with a carefree attitude.
Huang Dudu's second-generation princeling heart collapsed again!
Why did he know every pretty girl?

Chapter 74: Do Me a Favor

"Su Nantian, don't interrupt me!"
"If you're found guilty, I'll be just as harsh with you!"
Zhang Xue didn't know why she felt this way. She had been eager to meet this man, but upon meeting him, she still couldn't help but clash with him.
It was all his fault—he never let me win! He just undermined my efforts.
Zhang Xue faced Su Nantian and even her intelligence seemed to lower automatically.
She couldn't even catch his joke.
Furious, Zhang Xue had no outlet for her anger and continued to take it out on Huang Dudu.
"Your hairstyle alone doesn't make you a good person! Tell me, why did you file the report?"
"Otherwise I'll take you to the inspection team on false reporting!"
Huang Dudu thought it was a torment.
"Was it because I styled my hair like a rooster's comb? Does that make me look so untrustworthy?"
Lin Suyun hadn't intended to get out of the car and interfere.
She believed her man would handle everything well.
But when she saw it was Zhang Xue who had arrived, her womanly jealousy flared.
Plus, Zhang Xue seemed to have quarreled with her man.
She couldn't let Nan Tian suffer!
Lin Suyun ordered Gao Jingjing to stay in the car and then got out herself.
"Miss Zhang! Our Nan Tian has been driving properly all along!"
"It's this rooster's comb who started trouble and cried out for help! What should we do about it?"
Lin Suyun was usually gentle, but when her jealousy broke loose, she was as fierce as a tigress.
Zhang Xue heard Lin Suyun calling "our Nan Tian" and felt inexplicably angry.
The man hadn't said a word yet, so why was she so anxious?
As Zhang Xue was annoyed with Lin Suyun, Su Nantian suddenly flashed to her side and smiled, wrapping his arm around Lin Suyun's waist.
"Sweetheart, we should be polite to the inspector, after all, she came from afar."
He then affectionately tapped Lin Suyun's nose.
Normally, Su Nantian would have made Lin Suyun embarrassed if he did this in front of her.
But now, doing it in front of Zhang Xue made Lin Suyun feel relieved!
Zhang Xue saw the two of them acting lovey-dovey and was furious.
Wait, why am I angry? What does Su Nantian have to do with me?
Zhang Xue was mouthy but her body betrayed her. She still felt angry.
Her breath became hurried, and her bosom heaved.
Su Nantian thought he had teased Zhang Xue enough, so he earnestly explained the entire incident to her.
He also had Gao Jingjing get out of the car to confirm his words.
Zhang Xue already knew this matter was unlikely Su Nantian's fault before coming.
She had just wanted to provoke him, hence her previous behavior.
But she still felt uneasy inside.
This bastard was such a flirt! He had already hooked up with another pretty girl in just a few days!
Zhang Xue vowed to never speak to this man again.
The incident happened at a busy city intersection.
Two luxury cars were already eye-catching.
Then Zhang Xue's arrival and Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing getting out of the car one after another.
This made three exquisite beauties appear in this small area, each with their own charm.
It caused the crowd to grow more and more, all stopping to watch.
They even caused a traffic jam!
Su Nantian, already a celebrity, now became popular again.
Many fans informed each other that their idol was seen driving a luxury car in this place with three beautiful women.
It seemed like a quadrangle romance, which was quite absurd.
Su Nantian didn't know how many girls' hearts he had broken this time.
Seeing the crowd growing, Su Nantian didn't want to be stared at like an animal in a zoo.
"Miss Zhang, please do me a favor. If you have time, get us a driver's license, thank you!"
"There's nothing else, I'll go now. Goodbye."
Su Nantian said and then activated his幻影, speeding away instantly.
Zhang Xue was furious and cursed Su Nantian in her heart.
She could only take the unfortunate Huang Dudu back to the inspection team for punishment.
As for Su Nantian who had driven away, he was whistling and in a good mood.
He hadn't noticed Lin Suyun sitting in the car with a troubled expression.
It was Gao Jingjing who noticed something was wrong.
She asked with concern, "What's the matter, Sister Suyun? Are you unwell? Did you not rest well last night?"
Su Nantian then noticed Lin Suyun's odd behavior.
"It's all because of your Nan Tian!"
Lin Suyun sighed with resentment, as if Su Nantian had done something terrible to her.
"What did I do, Suyun?" Su Nantian asked carelessly.
"Hmph! You're such a flirt, that Zhang Xue must like you!"
Su Nantian was speechless.
Joking!
That violent girl, every time they met she seemed to want to eat him alive!
How could she like him?
Women's hearts are as elusive as the sea, always overthinking. Su Nantian certainly didn't say these words out loud.
He just comforted Lin Suyun not to overthink and emphasized it was nothing.
Lin Suyun was finally calmed down, but then she caught a glimpse of Gao Jingjing's beautiful face and felt another tightness in her chest.
Even the most innocent woman in love has some little tricks.
Lin Suyun hugged Gao Jingjing's shoulder, appearing very intimate.
She warned Su Nantian with a tone of command: "Su Nantian, I don't care about your relationships with other women."
"But one thing: now Jingjing is living with us, and she's still young."
"You absolutely mustn't dare to touch her!"
Su Nantian unashamedly denied it, looking at the rearview mirror of Gao Jingjing's red face and adorable appearance.
He couldn't help but lick his lips, it was really tempting!
But he still maintained a respectable image.
"You're just making things up! You've made Jingjing embarrassed."
"Jingjing, don't listen to your Suyun sister's nonsense. We're just siblings now, right?"
Su Nantian said this with a noble air, even though he didn't believe it himself.
Could it really just be siblings?
The girl's heart was simple, how could she know the real thoughts of a man?
Gao Jingjing felt an inexplicable sense of loss.
She only answered softly, like a mosquito: "Hmm."
Su Nantian was a man, carefree and didn't think there was anything wrong.
But Lin Suyun was much more careful.
This girl had also fallen into a trap!
Lin Suyun sighed inwardly.
Her boyfriend was so outstanding.
She knew there would definitely be more women falling for Su Nantian in the future.
But she was kind-hearted.
After briefly interacting with Gao Jingjing, she also liked her very much.
Although she could foresee this 18-year-old girl would become a strong rival in the future.
Lin Suyun couldn't help but feel no hatred at all.
Her hand, which had been holding Gao Jingjing's shoulder, became gentler.
It was like comforting the slightly disappointed girl.

Chapter 75: Cultivation Stage Six

Su Nantian drove.
After driving for an hour from the place where he had parted with Zhang Xue, they finally arrived at Fengyue Community.
After his previous quarrel with Wang Yanbing at the sales office, Wang Yanbing had submitted.
And finally, the chief supervisor Gao Shengyun appeared and treated Su Nantian with great respect.
Su Nantian's name was already well-known among the property management of Fengyue Community.
Every time they returned home, the guards smiled warmly when they saw Su Nantian or Lin Suyun.
Even strangers on the road, beautiful women and elderly ladies would smile at him.
It was understandable for the beauties, but the elderly women were somewhat eerie.
But this was what made Lin Suyun most uneasy!
Her boyfriend seemed to have a magnet for everyone, loved by people of all ages.
Perhaps those elderly women were already looking to find a match for their daughters.
The three of them arrived home, and Su Nantian was about to ask Lin Suyun to cook.
He also wanted to taste the food Lin Suyun cooked himself, wondering if it would be different.
Plus, recent days had been filled with various events, and Su Nantian hadn't had time to cultivate.
Now that he was home, he wanted to rest and take the opportunity.
However, Lin Suyun didn't know about this.
Perhaps she felt a little guilty for the affection between herself and Su Nantian with Gao Jingjing.
As soon as they arrived home, Lin Suyun pulled Gao Jingjing upstairs to show her around and choose a room.
"Nan Tian, remember to buy groceries and cook! If you don't have money, take it from my bag. I love you!"
Seeing the woman rushing to be hospitable, Su Nantian shook his head helplessly and had to go buy groceries.
Unlike when he was "supported" by Lin Suyun before, Su Nantian now controlled half of the Lin family's wealth and was much richer than Lin Suyun.
But now, Su and Lin were one family, so the money was the same.
Gao Jingjing had an extremely cold body and could not convert her cold energy into cultivation spiritual energy before.
Therefore, the coldness kept increasing.
Based on this, Su Nantian decided to take special care of Gao Jingjing in terms of diet.
After buying a large bag of ingredients, Su Nantian started planning a lavish lunch.
After thinking for a while, the menu was clear in his mind.
The title of "Divine Realm Culinary Master" wasn't a lie.
Although the Earth's Chinese cuisine and the Divine Realm had differences, Su Nantian could apply his knowledge.
Plus his excellent memory allowed him to learn new dishes easily.
Grilled sea bass with aluminum foil, twice-cooked pork, spicy beef.
Stir-fried oil lettuce, mushroom stir-fried oil vegetables, mapo tofu, kimchi platter.
Plus a fresh milk shrimp and mushroom soup and a sweet dessert of snow-socked red bean paste.
Three meats, four vegetables, one soup and a dessert, with exquisite colors and flavors.
It would take a top chef team in a restaurant to prepare such a feast in such a short time.
After coming to Earth, especially China, Su Nantian found that there were too many cuisines to go through one by one.
But his memory was astonishing, and he never forgot anything.
Lin Suyun usually preferred Sichuan cuisine, which was no problem for Su Nantian.
Gao Jingjing and Lin Suyun had similar tastes, but Gao Jingjing loved fish more.
This made things easier; he didn't need to make too many variations.
If Yao Lina knew what Su Nantian had cooked today, she would be very upset.
After all, when they first met, Su Nantian hadn't done such a big gesture.
Everything was ready, and Su Nantian went upstairs to call the two beauties down for lunch.
Gao Jingjing saw the table full of dishes and her mouth formed an "O".
Although Gao's family was noble, she could easily get rare delicacies.
But before Su Nantian appeared, due to Gao Jingjing's cold energy that couldn't be expelled, her diet was greatly affected.
Gao Qingyun wouldn't risk his granddaughter's life.
So even though Gao Jingjing was born into a wealthy family, her quality of life wasn't commendable.
She couldn't even enjoy the simple pleasures of common people.
Therefore, Gao Jingjing and her grandfather regarded Su Nantian as a savior and benefactor.
"Jingjing, eat freely today, don't be polite. Consider this your home."
Su Nantian said and also arranged chairs for the two beauties.
He set up seats for the two women, then took out two tall glasses.
He poured half a glass of 1982 Lafite for himself and Lin Suyun, and gave Gao Jingjing a box of juice.
The beauty was satisfied, but the little beauty Gao Jingjing wasn't happy.
"Big brother Nan Tian, I'm not a child anymore! I also want to drink with you and Suyun sister!"
Gao Jingjing pouted her pink lips, expressing her dissatisfaction cutely.
In the end, Su and Lin still spoiled this little sister and poured wine for her as well.
This meal made Gao Jingjing eat happily, praising Su Nantian with endless compliments throughout.
"Big brother Nan Tian is truly versatile! Even cooking is so delicious, what else can he not do?"
"Suyun sister, you're really lucky!"
The three of them happily finished their meal.
Su Nantian wanted Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing to rest at home.
But the two beauties didn't want to sit idle.
Lin Suyun led Gao Jingjing out to buy some more things to decorate the house.
Women, no matter their age, always love to be beautiful and are shopping addicts!
Su Nantian couldn't help but sigh inwardly.
After Lin and Gao left, Su Nantian quickly washed the dishes and then immediately went into his room to take out the storage ring.
He was so eager because he had kept five spirit stones obtained from Fan Jin at Longshan Temple and the supplies obtained from Gao's family in the storage ring.
He had long wanted to handle them properly to improve his cultivation.
Taking out the five spirit stones, Su Nantian examined them carefully. This was not ordinary spirit stones; their interiors seemed to have spiritual crystals.
Such things could only form after at least a thousand years of subterranean sedimentation.
What would five spirit stones transform into after being refined with the Hollow Spirit Purple Flame?
Impatient, Su Nantian didn't want to calculate the exact amount of spiritual energy.
In this Earth, which was extremely unsuitable for cultivation, having it was already good!
With a wave of his hand, a cluster of Hollow Spirit Purple Flame appeared.
Su Nantian focused entirely on refining the five spirit stones.
It was because of his weak strength that it would be best to refine them one by one.
But currently, he couldn't sustain the Hollow Spirit Purple Flame for long; he had to simplify.
Su Nantian felt his strength was insufficient but still tried to refine the spirit stones.
Spirit stones with internal spiritual crystals were indeed extraordinary, rarely seen even in the Divine Realm.
As the divine realm's most Yang fire burned them, they shrank at an observable speed.
But instead of melting into liquid like ordinary jade, they transformed into threads of spiritual energy.
Su Nantian greedily absorbed this precious cultivation nutrition.
As the spiritual energy flowed into his body and then into his Dan Tian Nascent Soul, a series of pleasant sensations came.
After about an hour, the five spirit stones were refined.
Su Nantian could barely move his body and was drenched in sweat.
Checking his cultivation, he was very surprised.
He had directly advanced from the Cultivation Stage Three to Six!
No wonder Fan Jin at nine stages was so desperate for these spirit stones.
Such spirit stones could really help a ninth-stage expert break through to the Primordial stage!

Chapter 76: Refining Talismans

Su Nantian steadied his Dan Tian and took a while to recover, his face showing joy. Reaching this stage was satisfying.
But Gao Jingjing's cold energy still needed to be controlled; if she had another attack, it would be difficult.
Su Nantian thought back and remembered that when he had helped with the gathering spirit array at Gao's house, there were still more than ten high-grade stones left.
Why not make a talisman for Gao Jingjing?
It could suppress her cold energy and protect her safety.
He opened the storage ring, and more than ten good stones were laid out before him. One was fine, two were fine; originally at Longshan Temple, he had planned to make a life-saving talisman for the little monk and Lin Suyun.
Why not do it all at once?
Su Nantian was a man who acted immediately. He quickly focused his mind.
He selected one high-grade jade from the more than ten stones. The jade felt very good, smooth and flawless.
Su Nantian held his breath and activated the Hollow Spirit Purple Flame; the jade was drawn into the flame.
The fire burned the jade, making a crackling sound.
To be honest, the power of six stages was much stronger than before; refining and activating were easier.
Even so, sweat appeared on Su Nantian's forehead, and his lips turned slightly pale.
After more than half an hour, a transparent talisman fell into Su Nantian's hand.
He held the talisman and narrowed his eyes; this talisman would definitely help Gao Jingjing's body.
With one push, Su Nantian refined two more stones with the remaining ones. Holding three stones in his hand, he could finally relax.
But after this process, his body was exhausted; he swayed and fell to the ground, closing his eyes and passing out...

Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing arrived at the largest mall in the city, which had seven floors.
Each floor was high-end goods; common people would never come here.
To put it bluntly, ordinary people couldn't even drive their cars in because this place only welcomed luxury cars worth over a million.
After parking, Lin Suyun held Gao Jingjing's hand and entered the mall.
The two women didn't lack money, and they loved shopping; once they started buying, they spent over three million instantly.
They each bought a high-end suit and a simple-colored dress, though they looked different, both had their own charm.
In the soft furnishing store, Lin Suyun fell in love with a deep blue curtain with tassels and a semi-transparent thin gauze on top.
It was grand yet had a touch of tenderness; if placed in the living room, it would be very warm.
Lin Suyun pulled Gao Jingjing over and asked with a smile, "Jingjing, do you think this is nice?"
The two beauties had different ages but similar aesthetics. Gao Jingjing also thought it was very good and decided to take this one, leaving the bedroom curtains for later.
While discussing the curtains, the two women didn't notice that a pair of hot eyes were staring at them from upstairs.
They had bought several more curtains, and Lin and Gao were about to pay.
"Hello." The salesperson spoke with a sweet and respectful voice, "Total is 328,000 yuan."
Lin Suyun had no expression on her face and took out a limited edition black card, handing it to the salesperson.
But the card was pushed away by a thin hand and replaced with a platinum credit card.
"Charge it to mine."
A slightly light-hearted male voice entered the two women's ears.
Lin Suyun frowned and turned around to look, a man about 180 cm tall appeared behind them with a broad smile but his eyes were flirtatious.
"I'll pay for it." He said.
Lin Suyun immediately became alert and stretched out her arm to pull Gao Jingjing behind her.
Gao Jingjing stared with wide eyes, confused about what the man wanted to do.
"Why should I pay for your shopping?" Lin Suyun said firmly, pushing her black card to the salesperson and adding, "Charge this one."
"Ah!"
The man sighed happily.
"It's my honor to spend money on these two beauties. Besides, it's not that expensive."
Lin Suyun had already sensed this man was no good. She wanted to keep away from him and finish paying, then leave quickly; they had already bought most of the things.
Lin Suyun protected Gao Jingjing and said calmly to the salesperson, "Charge my card. We'll come back in a few days to pick it up. Also, find the decorators from your store."
The salesperson was about to swipe the card but heard the man whisper, "Whose card are you going to charge? I think you know."
The salesperson trembled and, in a hurry, swiped the platinum card.
"You..."
Lin Suyun was speechless but seeing the salesperson's head down and not daring to breathe, she couldn't say anything.
The money was paid; she had no choice but to tell the salesperson, "Give me the card. I'll transfer it later."
"Don't worry; if you really want to thank me, how about having dinner with me?"
Lin Suyun frowned and shook her head. She led Gao Jingjing forward, but the man rushed ahead and took a breath: "What's wrong? You two beauties don't want to give me face?"
This kind of lecher, Lin Suyun had seen many. They all had ulterior motives.
Lin Suyun was very determined.
"Give the money back to us, but we can't go to dinner with you. Please make it convenient."
She said and led Gao Jingjing to leave.
The man couldn't bear it anymore; he had been known in the city, and who dared to refuse him?
This time he had been rejected several times by these two girls, and they were really ungrateful!
He had noticed these two girls for a long time. One was like water, the other was elegant and stylish. If he could subdue them both under him, it would be exciting fun!
Tang Sanqian blocked the two women's way. His previous smile was gone, leaving only a sly expression. He stretched his neck and asked: "Do you know who I am?"
Lin Suyun's eyes flashed with anger.
"If not, then don't be so stubborn!"
Tang Sanqian sneered and said: "If you don't go, then I won't be polite!"

Chapter 77: Definitely Can't Handle

After Su Nantian woke up, it was already afternoon. The sky was slightly dark.
He went downstairs and saw that Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing hadn't returned; the house was empty, with a cold chill.
Strange?
Su Nantian felt something was wrong. Going to the mall was just a short trip, they should have returned after buying things. Why did it take so long?
He decided immediately and called Lin Suyun's phone.
The dialing sound lasted for a while before he heard a scared voice.
"Big brother Nan Tian, I-I... we were blocked at the mall and couldn't leave."
The voice was mixed with a sob, as if they were being bullied.
Background noise could faintly be heard of Lin Suyun arguing with a man, who spoke very vulgarly and kept saying "little mistress." Su Nantian was furious. Who dared to speak like this to his women? He really didn't want to live!
Su Nantian rushed out like the wind and drove his Rolls-Royce directly to the mall.
Although he didn't have a license yet, he couldn't care at this moment.
At the mall, he saw a crowd surrounding a circle. He squeezed through the gap and saw a tall, thin man trying to grab Lin Suyun's hand. The girl was protecting Gao Jingjing and stepping back.
You little bastard, your courage is really bold!
Tang Sanqian extended his greasy hand to try to grope Lin Suyun. This woman had white skin and a good figure; the touch would be nice. Even if they couldn't eat together, at least he could grope a few times to satisfy himself.
But before his hand touched the woman, a heavy pressure snapped his wrist.
Only to hear "crack" sounds of bones breaking; Tang Sanqian's hand bone was twisted off.
Su Nantian coldly sneered and said, "Kid, my woman, what are you doing?"
Tang Sanqian was quite resilient. Although his hand bone had broken, sweat dropped from his forehead, but he didn't say a word.
He gritted his teeth and looked at Su Nantian, then saw the two girls had circled around him. He understood.
"Are you the boyfriend of these two girls?"
Lin Suyun didn't react much after hearing it, already accustomed.
But Gao Jingjing heard Tang Sanqian call her one of Su Nantian's girlfriends. Her face turned red instantly, and the fear and panic disappeared completely; her heart pounded wildly.
Lin Suyun whispered to Su Nantian, "The things were bought already. When we were about to check out, he appeared and even paid for it."
Su Nantian coldly asked, "How much?"
"328,000 yuan."
He contemptuously took out a bank card from his pocket and casually threw it at Tang Sanqian's feet, sneering: "There is one million in this card. That's your repayment."
After saying that, he pulled Gao Jingjing and Lin Suyun to leave.
Tang Sanqian was embarrassed, being humiliated in front of so many people and even giving a bank card to mock him. It was too much; he had never been treated like this in his twenty years of life!
Tang Sanqian howled, "You stop there. You say walk away? I ask you if you dare to go with me to the rooftop?"
Su Nantian didn't want to bother with this second-generation prince, who had no real talent and just whined. He felt good today because he had refined the talisman well, so his mood was better. For a person like him, breaking one hand was already good enough.
But Tang Sanqian didn't know Su Nantian's thoughts, he took three steps and two strides to rush forward, blocking the three people in front of him. He was eager to say: "You're such a coward, aren't you afraid that Grandpa will beat you into calling him dad?"
Provocation?
Su Nantian sneered and had only one way with this kind of person: to fight! Fight until he was subdued!
"Okay, how do you want to play?"
Tang Sanqian wasn't a hero or a good person; when he came after, he secretly sent a text to his brother, telling him that he was being bullied and to bring more people.
Tang Sanqian dragged his broken hand, proudly raised his head and looked at Su Nantian with a nose.
"You've really messed up, I'll let you know why the flowers are so red!"
On the rooftop.
Tang Sanqian led a group of his brothers to surround Su Nantian and the two women.
Lin Suyun saw this scoundrel had brought so many people, she knew they were tricked!
She angrily said, "Tang Sanqian, you're really a bastard. If you don't want to fight, why did you invite us up here to surround us?"
Tang Sanqian smiled slyly, looking very cunning.
He helplessly shrugged his shoulders and waved his broken hand at the three of them, saying: "Little beauty, I don't want to trouble you. But who called your boyfriend so cruel? He broke my hand. In this world, there's a saying of retaliation; do I not deserve to break his hand?"
Tang Sanqian, relying on the number of people, was very arrogant. His nose almost reached the sky.
Gao Jingjing felt worried; she knew Su Nantian's ability, but with so many people around, front and back added up to twenty or thirty. How could they handle it?
Lin Suyun frowned and secretly asked Su Nantian, "Should we call the police?"
Su Nantian shook his head and told them not to worry. His cultivation at stage six had improved his physical condition, and he was also itching for a fight. He would try it out.
Tang Sanqian smiled lewdly, looking at the two beauties and drooling.
"Let me make a deal with you."
"Hmm?" Su Nantian sneered.
"I and my brothers can let you go, but you have to give the two little beauties to me. Don't worry, I won't harm them; just borrow one night for my bed."
His voice was disgusting. Su Nantian clenched his fists, thinking he would punch him in the face several times to give him a facial reconstruction!
"Daydream!"
Su Nantian said, and Tang Sanqian couldn't bear it. This person was too disrespectful! He should be thoroughly beaten!
With Tang Sanqian's command, more than twenty people rushed forward. Some had knives and wooden sticks. Su Nantian dodged their attacks skillfully, rushing to Tang Sanqian's front and slapping his chest. The man flew backward and crashed into the railing.
Capture the leader first; Su Nantian understood this principle.
Tang Sanqian spat out blood and leaned against the railing awkwardly.
None of the twenty people dared to move, watching Su Nantian step forward and squat down next to Tang Sanqian. He said: "Kid, learn your lesson!"
After saying this sentence, he heard a "bang" and the rooftop door was kicked open.

Chapter 78: I Don't Care Who Your Dad Is

A man in a long robe walked in. He looked about thirty years old, not very old.
He saw Tang Sanqian lying on the ground and ran over, exclaiming: "Sanqian! Are you okay?"
Tang Sanqian blinked his eyes and saw the man. He wiped his face with his hand that wasn't injured, then said: "Brother! I was bullied. It's him!"
Tang Sanqian's brother?
Su Nantian frowned and thought, these people's relationships were really messy.
Tang Sanqian was still in a mess but seven不服 and eight不愤, tightly gritting his teeth and looking at Su Nantian with a fierce expression: "You little bastard, do you know who I am? If I tell my dad about this, you'll be in trouble!"
Tang Sanqian's brother also couldn't bear it and stood up angrily, gritting his teeth: "Who are you? Dare to beat my brother like this. You're dead!"
Su Nantian looked at the two of them and found it funny, "Hmph," he even laughed.
"Who are your fathers? Tell me."
Tang Sanqian trembled and stood up, then spat out some blood to the side. He said proudly: "Tell you the truth, our Tang family isn't easy to mess with. You Su what's his name can't handle it!"
Su Nantian didn't want to argue with Tang Sanqian anymore; he had already punched him once, so he should be quiet.
He walked to Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing's side and said: "It's getting late. We should go back now. After arriving home, I'll think about making you two something delicious."
The two girls nodded and walked on either side of Su Nantian.
