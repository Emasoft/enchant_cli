Su Nantian did not respond to the bodyguard's intent, merely curling his lips and deepening his gaze, a cryptic glimmer flashing swiftly across his eyes.

The more enigmatic Su Nantian became, the more he terrified the bodyguard, leaving him trembling and anxious.

The bodyguard stared at Su Nantian in sheer dread, especially when he saw Su Nantian slowly raising the gun to his own head. The bodyguard's eyes widened with even greater alarm.

“Boom!”

A moment later, a sound echoed—though it was not the report of a gun, but rather the thud of a heavy object striking the head.

Su Nantian toyed with the gun in his hand, his fingers twisting it smoothly before striking the bodyguard unconscious with the barrel.

Gazing at the unconscious and fallen bodyguard, Su Nantian smiled again, murmuring softly: “Killing you is unnecessary. I merely need to ensure you don’t hinder me when I rescue her.”

This was why Su Nantian had chosen such a decisive method—ensuring the man could not speak.

After dealing with the bodyguard, Su Nantian prepared to depart. He headed toward the location the bodyguard had indicated—Rain Listening Pavilion.

Moreover, Su Nantian felt a strong intuition: Wu Tao and his wife, the parents of Wu You’er, were definitely within Rain Listening Pavilion!

Su Nantian followed the familiar path forward, carefully avoiding the patrolling security personnel.

Soon, he halted, his gaze fixed on the red building ahead. This must be Rain Listening Pavilion.

Su Nantian’s lips curled slightly, his gaze deepening—confirmation had arrived.

After all, the guards here were even more numerous than those guarding Wu You’er. Such overt security hardly needed further explanation.

Having made up his mind, Su Nantian resolved to not only rescue Wu You’er but also take her parents with him tonight.

Su Nantian remained outside, strategizing boldly, unaware that a terrible event was unfolding within Rain Listening Pavilion at that very moment.

“Wu Chuan, you’ve come.”

Wu Tao’s hands were bound to a pillar, his feet unable to touch the ground. This position exhausted him further, demanding more strength to sustain.

Days of torment and interrogation had left Wu Tao mentally drained. Yet he refused to yield, his body dirtied but his eyes still sharp and resolute.

Wu Tao’s wife, Zhao Mei—Wu You’er’s mother—had also remained steadfast, never yielding.

“Hmph. You’ve even remembered my footsteps?” Wu Chuan stepped through the door, surprised that Wu Tao recognized his steps. He raised an eyebrow, smiling lightly as if they were old friends, their conversation casual.

“You heartless scoundrel! You personally slaughtered your clan members. Even if you turned to ash, I would still recognize you!”

Wu Tao spat a mouthful of saliva, glaring fiercely at Wu Chuan. He did not retreat an inch in his curses: “May you die a miserable death!”

“Silence! How dare you insult the master like that!”

Before Wu Chuan could respond, Li’s assistant, standing behind him, could not contain his anger. He immediately rebuked Wu Tao, signaling the man to stop speaking.

“Hmph!”

Wu Tao did not fear Wu Chuan, so why would he fear a mere assistant?

“You lowly lackey dare to speak such words? I am merely stating the truth. There is no insult! If Wu Chuan were truly upright and virtuous, why would he fear personally assuming the family head?”

Wu Tao continued cursing, dragging Li’s assistant into his tirade: “He is merely a thief with a guilty conscience, fearing that sitting on the family head’s seat would invite the torment of vengeful spirits every day. May he meet a tragic end!”

At this, Wu Chuan’s smile vanished instantly, his eyes darkening with an icy chill.

Clearly, Wu Tao’s words had struck a nerve. Why had he gone to such lengths to elevate Wu You’er? Because his claim was illegitimate.

Wu You’er was his shield, and now Wu Tao had torn it away. No wonder Wu Chuan’s expression darkened abruptly.

“Silence!”

Li’s assistant glared at Wu Tao, exasperatedly rebuking him. Clearly, Wu Tao’s words had struck a chord.

Wu Chuan merely waved his hand, sneering: “Let him speak!”

Chapter 716: An Unexpected Event

“Let him continue speaking!” Wu Chuan wished to see what else Wu Tao could say.

Indeed, they had given them the chance. Wu Chuan felt Wu Tao and his wife were audaciously bold, and Wu You’er was indeed their daughter—her curses mirrored theirs.

“Master?” Li’s assistant, confused by Wu Chuan’s words, hesitated slightly before gazing at Wu Chuan in confusion.

But upon seeing Wu Chuan’s sinister expression, Li’s assistant quickly fell silent, no longer uttering a word.

“You!” Wu Tao had countless words to curse Wu Chuan with, but upon seeing his indifferent gaze, he suddenly found himself speechless. His words could not be spoken.

Zhao Mei was the same, only gazing at Wu Chuan with hatred.

“Hmph. No more curses?” Wu Chuan sneered at Wu Tao and Zhao Mei, utterly dismissive.

He continued: “I gave you the chance to curse. You didn’t?”

“Indeed, just useless pests and worthless scum!”

This time, it was Wu Chuan who cursed Wu Tao and Zhao Mei. He stepped forward, thrusting his finger into Wu Tao’s forehead—a highly insulting gesture.

“Master!” Li’s assistant, worried that Wu Chuan was too close to Wu Tao and feared he might be harmed, wanted to warn him. However, upon seeing Wu Chuan’s gaze, Li’s assistant swallowed his words and said nothing more.

Yet the next moment, Li’s assistant’s fears materialized.

As Wu Chuan continued to insult Wu Tao with gestures, Wu Tao suddenly exerted himself, producing a clanking sound from the chains. He bit down fiercely on Wu Chuan’s finger.

If Li’s assistant had not reacted promptly, striking Wu Tao’s head with an iron rod, Wu Tao might have bitten off his finger entirely!

“Master! Are you alright?” Li’s assistant discarded the iron rod, urgently asking Wu Chuan, his face filled with concern. It was truly an unfortunate accident.

Li’s assistant felt uneasy and restless, especially upon seeing Wu Chuan’s bloodied finger. His heart turned cold.

Though Wu Tao and Zhao Mei were despicable, Wu Chuan still needed them to control Wu You’er. Thus, they had value. In other words, he would be the one to suffer the consequences!

The more he thought of this, the paler Li’s assistant became. His eyes grew even more anxious, and his hands trembled.

He wished to examine Wu Chuan’s wound, but Wu Chuan immediately pushed his hand away. With a glance, he silenced Li’s assistant completely.

“Hmph. Well done! Well done!”

Wu Chuan’s finger was bloodied and gushing, yet he seemed to feel no pain. He stepped closer to Wu Tao.

Wu Chuan let out a cold laugh, his eyes devoid of emotion.

“Wu Tao. Why provoke me so foolishly? I had intended to show mercy, let you off. But you insist on provoking me!”

Wu Chuan spoke coldly, each word like a fatal ice spear, chilling and suffocating: “Since you dare provoke me, be prepared to bear my wrath.”

“Wu Chuan! What are you planning!”

Perhaps due to his familiarity with Wu Chuan, Wu Tao instantly understood what he intended. He glared at him furiously, his eyes wide with anger, even his corners of the eyes seemed to tear open. His chest heaved violently: “Wu Chuan! The blame has a head, the debt has a master! If you have grievances, take them out on me. Don’t harm You’er!”

It was said that women are weak, but when mothers, they become strong. Zhao Mei had been lifeless and bound to the pillar, even lacking strength to care when Wu Chuan appeared before her. But now, upon hearing Wu Chuan’s intent to harm Wu You’er, Zhao Mei immediately lifted her head: “Wu Chuan! You cannot treat You’er this way. She is not only our daughter, but also your niece!”

She continued: “Moreover, You’er is merely a child. She has no connection to our quarrel! You cannot treat her thus!”

Zhao Mei grew more agitated, her voice becoming hoarse. Yet she continued to gaze at Wu Chuan earnestly, hoping he would show mercy and spare You’er.

“Hmph. Struggle as you will, you may struggle.”

Wu Chuan remained unmoved, raising an eyebrow and enjoying the scene before him.

“Had you known this beforehand, why did you curse so vehemently?”

Wu Chuan let out another cold laugh, continuing to speak softly. Yet each of his words was like a ghost rising from hell, chilling and trembling all over.

“Moreover, my dear elder brother, you know well enough that I am fond of tormenting those dear to others. Because only then will your faces show tenfold, even a hundredfold more pain.”

After saying this, Wu Chuan let out another cold laugh: “This is far more entertaining than tormenting you two.”

That was indeed the truth of Wu Chuan.

He was truly a devil. Otherwise, how could he become increasingly excited upon seeing Wu Tao and Zhao Mei’s despair?

He even felt his blood trembling.

“Wu Chuan! You are no better than a beast! May you die a miserable death! You do not even spare your own relatives. You will be haunted by vengeful spirits and tormented by demons every day!”

Wu Tao raged, having cursed Wu Chuan with all the vile words he could think of.

Unfortunately, Wu Chuan’s expression remained indifferent, unaffected by their curses. Even he had the leisure to smile.

When Wu Tao and Zhao Mei finally finished cursing, Wu Chuan spoke: “Oh, by the way, you may rest easy. I won’t harm You’er so soon.”

“You!”

Wu Tao and Zhao Mei, upon hearing Wu You’er’s name, immediately raised their heads in fury.

Wu Chuan, however, gestured for them to be silent: “Shhh. Don’t interrupt me. I haven’t finished yet. You’er still has a role for me now. But after the wetland bidding competition, I will ascend as the new family head. Then…”

Wu Chuan stopped speaking at this point, knowing that such omissions would only provoke more imagination.

Human imagination was boundless; the terrifying tortures they imagined would be far worse.

“Then, you will watch as your precious daughter faces her fate! Ha ha!”

Wu Chuan laughed heartily, watching Wu Tao and Zhao Mei’s anguish.

Chapter 717: Ceasing the Torture

“Wu Chuan! You are no better than a beast! May you die a miserable death!”

Wu Tao and Zhao Mei continued cursing Wu Chuan, but this time, Wu Chuan remained unmoved. His curses seemed to have no effect on him.

Wu Chuan did not even turn his head, directly walking toward the door. He gave Wu Tao and Zhao Mei no extra glance.

At the doorway, Wu Chuan suddenly halted. Yet he did not turn back; instead, he instructed Li’s assistant beside him: “Amu, have someone watch over them. Take good care of them.”

He wanted Wu Tao and Zhao Mei to witness the torment he would inflict on You’er.

Wu Chuan was adept at torture. He knew Wu Tao and Zhao Mei were unafraid of physical punishment or even death. Their only weakness was You’er.

Wu Chuan had always used this to balance them, preventing them from rebelling. But now he was tired of the game and no longer willing to tolerate it. He would take the position, watching who dared to openly accuse him behind his back.

“Hmph.”

After giving the order, Wu Chuan let out another cold laugh. He stepped forward again, this time truly leaving Rain Listening Pavilion.

“Did you hear the master’s instructions?”

After Wu Chuan left, Li’s assistant spoke sternly to the two subordinates guarding Wu Tao and Zhao Mei. He added coldly: “Remember, take good care of them. Don’t let anything go wrong.”

“Yes! Yes! Master Li!”

The two subordinates knew Li’s assistant was a favorite of Wu Chuan. How could they disobey his orders?

They answered respectfully, each patting their chests to assure Li’s assistant.

“Hmph.”

Li’s assistant nodded in satisfaction. Before leaving, he cast a cold glance at Wu Tao and Zhao Mei bound to the pillar before speaking lightly: “Truly overreaching!”

Daring to oppose Wu Chuan was truly overreaching.

After all, Wu Chuan had already said he would inherit the family head position after the wetland bidding competition. Killing You’er would make Wu Tao and Zhao Mei’s value obsolete.

Thinking of this, Li’s assistant felt even more triumphant. He no longer paid much attention to Wu Tao and Zhao Mei.

Li’s assistant gave the subordinates one more warning, telling them to take care of Wu Tao and Zhao Mei before leaving.

“Ugh! You two couldn’t be more troublesome, could you? Fortunately, no trouble arose!”

The two subordinates showed their ferocity after Li’s assistant left. They glared at Wu Tao and Zhao Mei with resentment, cursing them without mercy.

“Almost got us in trouble!”

The other subordinate recalled Wu Tao’s continuous curses against Wu Chuan, still feeling a chill in his heart. Fortunately, Wu Chuan had not taken them out on.

Otherwise, they would have been in deep trouble!

Watching over Wu Tao and Zhao Mei was not lucrative. They had to be careful, ensuring they did not escape and always heed Wu Chuan’s orders.

This pressure was greater than other servants in the Wu family. They had felt suffocated for a long time, and now Wu Tao and Zhao Mei were still unruly. They had no choice but to be angry.

“Ugh! What bad luck we have, being assigned to watch them!”

The other subordinate thought more and more about his anger and resentment. He muttered a curse under his breath.

“Hmph! Liang, you don’t have to be so angry. Let’s find some fun?”

One of them let out a sinister laugh, then suggested: “Your face is so gloomy. Let’s find some fun?”

His expression was clearly sinister, and his gaze fell on the tools used to interrogate prisoners.

The one called Liang immediately understood his implication. However, he shook his head: “Let it be! If the master gets angry, that would be bad. These two still have value!”

He dared not resort to private punishment.

Though it could be satisfying and vent their anger, one mistake could cost them their lives. After thinking it over, Liang immediately refused.

“Xiaoliu, don’t play around. Be careful not to cause trouble!”

Hu Ge thought for a moment and warned Xiaoliu again, fearing he might act recklessly.

“Hmph! Liang, you’re too timid. We won’t harm them. Just a little lesson will do!”

Xiaoliu looked down on Liang in his mind but still spoke to persuade him: “Liang, don’t worry. I’m not that foolish as to kill them!”

“Liang! Think about it. How did he just scare us? If we hadn’t been lucky, we would have become his coffin!”

Xiaoliu continued to encourage Liang and hinted further.

After hearing this, Liang remembered the fear he had just felt. He hesitated but eventually let his inner demon overcome his caution, deciding to vent his anger from today.

“Alright then. Xiaoliu, let’s give them a taste of their own medicine!”

Liang decided to punish Wu Tao and Zhao Mei slightly, venting his inner anger.

“Hmph.”

After making up his mind, Liang saw the tools stacked there and smiled sinisterly.

Liang and Xiaoliu rubbed their hands together, laughing maliciously as they approached Wu Tao and Zhao Mei.

Wu Tao and Zhao Mei both widened their eyes. Obviously, they had not missed Xiaoliu and Liang’s conversation. However, neither of them showed fear; instead, they became even more fearless.

They exchanged a glance and gave each other a tender smile, as if ready to accept any consequences.

“Meizi, are you afraid?”

Wu Tao suddenly asked a question without context. Zhao Mei understood Wu Tao’s meaning and smiled gently at him before shaking her head.

“Hmph! You’re afraid, but it’s no use!”

Xiaoliu and Liang had now approached them. They heard Wu Tao say this to Zhao Mei, so they laughed mockingly: “What took you so long? Now you’re afraid? Hmph!”

They continued to laugh sinisterly, choosing suitable tools to give Wu Tao and Zhao Mei a lesson.

“Meizi, we’ve burdened You’er too much. We can’t continue to delay her anymore.”

Wu Tao ignored Xiaoliu and Liang’s words, as if he hadn’t heard them. His eyes were only on Zhao Mei, allowing no one else to intrude between them.

Chapter 718: Willing to Die

“Hmph.”

Zhao Mei was the same as Wu Tao, completely unaware of external matters. Her eyes were only on Wu Tao, allowing no one else to intrude.

“It’s time we stopped burdening You’er.”

Zhao Mei spoke softly again. They had been in this dark place long enough to forget the appearance of sunlight.

At first, they resisted Wu Chuan’s torture, hoping for a family reunion. But now that they suffered and You’er also suffered, they no longer wished to burden her.

“Liang! What are they saying? It’s so strange!”

Xiaoliu suddenly felt a sense of unease spreading through his body. He instinctively turned to ask Liang, hoping his partner might know.

“I don’t know either.”

Liang was also confused, even more so than Xiaoliu.

“They’re not crazy, are they? We haven’t started yet!”

Liang spoke absentmindedly while looking at the whip with saltwater. He hadn’t even struck yet.

“Never mind! Let’s just start!”

Xiaoliu frowned, then told Liang: “Let’s get started! Let them know our strength!”

“Ah!”

As Xiaoliu finished speaking, Liang let out a terrified scream. His eyes were wide open, almost popping out of his sockets.

“What’s wrong! Liang!”

Upon hearing Liang’s scream, Xiaoliu became more anxious. His forehead broke out in cold sweat as he anxiously asked: “What’s wrong?”

Upon seeing the scene before him, he lost his ability to speak.

Because Wu Tao and Zhao Mei had both bitten their tongues and committed suicide!

They gazed at each other tenderly, blood spilling incessantly from their lips. One drop, two drops… until it fell to the ground.

The sound was truly hair-raising.

They had committed suicide…

“Liang! Liang!”

After taking several deep breaths, Xiaoliu finally regained his voice. He looked terrified and anxiously called out: “What do we do now!”

Xiaoliu was so scared he stammered, his simple sentence stuttering several times before completing it.

“Ah! Who do I ask? I don’t know either!”

Liang suddenly snapped back to reality. Upon seeing the scene, he was extremely panicked. How could this happen?

“Quick! Go tell the master!”

No matter what, they had to report it immediately. The responsibility was too great; they couldn’t escape it.

After saying this, Liang ran toward the door as fast as he could, his movements quick like a ghost was chasing him.

Xiaoliu heard Liang’s words and immediately snapped back to reality, running after Liang. At the same time, Xiaoliu prayed inwardly for his life.

“What’s going on with these two?”

Su Nantian arrived at Rain Listening Pavilion according to the bodyguard’s instructions. He had been waiting by the door, looking for an opportunity to sneak in. However, he hadn’t expected two people to run out of the building frantically.

Then Su Nantian saw these two people gesturing wildly at the security guards by the door, all running toward the outside.

Su Nantian was puzzled but took this opportunity to run in quickly. He needed to confirm whether Wu Tao and Zhao Mei were here.

After thinking this through, Su Nantian carefully surveyed the surroundings. He saw no hidden people and confirmed it wasn’t a trap before running in.

“Wu Tao?”

Su Nantian called out Wu Tao’s name, then ran into the building while searching for their location. He was also cautious of Wu Family’s security.

“Is he here?”

Su Nantian ran through the building without seeing anyone. At this point, he noticed that the door ahead was open and raised an eyebrow in confusion.

“Never mind. Let’s go check.”

Su Nantian muttered to himself and ran in quickly. However, when he reached the door, his foot halted.

He had never stepped over this threshold.

Su Nantian stared at the pair of men and women bound to a pillar. From their familiar faces, he identified them as Wu You’er’s parents.

He had found them.

But it was too late, for Wu Tao and Zhao Mei were already dead.

Su Nantian’s gaze darkened. His pupils involuntarily expanded, his eyes fixed on the dried blood at their lips.

Su Nantian finally stepped in. He placed his fingers on Wu Tao’s neck, attempting to feel for a pulse—only to find no response.

Moreover, the skin was cold.

He had arrived too late.

“Damn it!”

Su Nantian cursed under his breath, clenching his teeth in frustration. He angrily hit the pillar: “Why!”

Su Nantian gritted his teeth, squeezing out his confusion. He could determine their approximate time of death from their body temperature—just minutes ago.

If only he had been faster! Would they have died…?

But no matter how Su Nantian regretted or felt guilty, it was too late. Wu Tao and Zhao Mei were already dead. He had no power to resurrect them!

Su Nantian gazed at the scattered tools, his face darkening further. His eyes were gloomy, like a storm approaching.

“Master! It’s not our fault! We just lost focus for a moment, and they committed suicide!”

The sound of voices came from the corridor outside. It was clear that the speaker was extremely anxious and frightened.

At the same time, Su Nantian heard another angry shout: “Fools! I told you to watch them closely, but they still found a way!”

This voice was Wu Chuan’s…

Su Nantian’s eyes widened slightly. However, now that Wu Chuan had arrived, he couldn’t stay here any longer.

Su Nantian didn’t have time to deal with the situation. If he stayed, he would be discovered! He needed to hide first!

There was an idea.

Su Nantian’s eyes quickly searched for a hiding place. Finally, he focused on the space under the cabinet of tools. There was enough room to fit him alone.

Moreover, it was covered with a black cloth. As long as they didn’t lift the cloth, they wouldn’t discover his presence!

At that moment, Su Nantian slipped into the cabinet under the tools just as their voices reached the door.
