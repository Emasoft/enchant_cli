Even if Nan Gong Ping's strength were merely ordinary, he could only be considered an average man. There would be no worse scenario than this. As long as Nan Gong Lin could assign many trustworthy assistants to Nan Gong Ping, the family's fortunes would surely rise.

Moreover, at critical moments, Nan Gong Yu Yan might have to court external forces to save the Nan Gong family—perhaps even resorting to a marriage alliance akin to ancient princesses.

Yet, all of this Nan Gong Yu Yan was fully aware of. She knew what her father was scheming, so she had been tirelessly striving. She had also repeatedly hinted to her father that she could remain unmarried for life, dedicating herself entirely to the Nan Gong family, thereby allowing her position to be passed on to her brother's children.

But Nan Gong Lin had consistently evaded this topic, leaving it unresolved.

Thus, Nan Gong Yu Yan understood that only by achieving a certain level of success could she truly ease her father's concerns.

This was why, unlike other girls in her age who simply dressed elegantly and strolled about shopping for clothes, Nan Gong Yu Yan had no choice but to shoulder countless responsibilities of the Nan Gong family. She forced herself to strive for excellence.

Nan Gong Yu Yan had once questioned why she felt such emotions when facing Su Nan Tian. After a careful recollection, she realized that only by his side did she feel an unprecedented sense of security.

This feeling had never been given to her before—neither by Nan Gong Lin nor anyone else. Yet this man had miraculously granted it to her, making her realize that her feelings for him were extraordinary.

Moreover, she knew this feeling did not stem from Su Nan Tian being a bodyguard or his reliability. After all, before Su Nan Tian, Chao Ye had also protected her, yet she had never felt such a sensation.

Thus, Nan Gong Yu Yan was certain that this emotion stemmed from her affection for Su Nan Tian. However, at present, it seemed Su Nan Tian showed no interest in her at all—perhaps even excessively cold. When facing her, he always maintained a professional demeanor, viewing it merely as work.

At this thought, Nan Gong Yu Yan felt some helplessness. He turned his head to glance at Su Nan Tian again, only to find that Su Nan Tian was deliberately avoiding his gaze, gazing out at the scenery through the car window.

Moreover, since the moment they entered the vehicle, Nan Gong Yu Yan had sensed Su Nan Tian's hesitation. He had initially intended to sit in the front passenger seat, but upon discovering that both the front and rear vehicles had no space for him, he was forced to sit beside Nan Gong Yu Yan.

Nan Gong Yu Yan felt a quiet disappointment. He wondered if Su Nan Tian actually disliked him, hence this emotional response.

Chapter 549: A Display of Authority

At that moment, Su Nan Tian was also somewhat puzzled. He had continuously sensed Nan Gong Yu Yan observing him. His mind felt something amiss, for he knew Nan Gong Yu Yan was far more capable than Nan Gong Ping. He feared his disguise might be discovered.

Thus, Su Nan Tian deliberately gazed out the window to avoid Nan Gong Yu Yan's eyes.

Yet neither of them realized that their inner thoughts were entirely different.

However, this awkward atmosphere did not last long. After some time, the car finally arrived at Wu's inland port. People disembarked one by one.

Although Wu Family had transferred most of the profit rights to Nan Gong family, this time Wu Chuan did not directly come to meet them. Instead, he let Nan Gong Yu Yan and his group handle it themselves—this was essentially a display of authority.

It wasn't that Wu Chuan would prevent them from taking over. He simply wanted to make it difficult for them, sending a signal to the Nan Gong family: only this year do you have the right here. When the time comes, return the inland port immediately—don't even dare to think of monopolizing it.

All of this had been anticipated by Nan Gong Yu Yan. Upon disembarking, the entire inland port was strangely quiet. Normally, it should have been bustling, but now it was eerily silent, with goods neatly arranged. It seemed the workers had already completed their tasks.

After Su Nan Tian stepped out, he also felt something was off. He said to Nan Gong Yu Yan: "Why does this inland port look like this? Shouldn't they be busy now? Why is there no one around?"

Nan Gong Yu Yan simply smiled and replied: "Wu Chuan truly has a clever strategy. To give us this display of authority, he must have had his workers work overtime overnight, completing all the tasks today. Unless a new ship arrives, they won't appear outside."

Su Nan Tian's thoughts aligned with Nan Gong Yu Yan's, but he chose not to appear overly intelligent before her, as that would draw more attention.

Su Nan Tian had no such concerns when by Nan Gong Ping's side, for Nan Gong Ping was less vigilant.

"Seems we'll need to find people first," said Nan Gong Yu Yan, then instructed his bodyguards: "You all go and find them. They can't be absent here. Once you find their location, don't attack or speak to them—just tell me where they are so I can go there."

After issuing the order, the bodyguards nodded and immediately began searching. Though there were offices here, Nan Gong Yu Yan thought these people wouldn't stay in the office for her to find. Still, he said to Su Nan Tian: "You come with me to check the office. Though it's unlikely, we should at least take a look."

"Okay," Su Nan Tian nodded and walked with Nan Gong Yu Yan toward the office.

When they arrived at the office door, they found it locked. Through the glass, the interior appeared somewhat messy—not orderly at all.

It seemed these workers had occasionally rested here. Though it was an office, aside from a few people handling accounts, most were in charge of dock operations.

"Those people must have left just now. They probably heard the news and fled hastily. They had already planned for this situation, so they hid deliberately," Su Nan Tian said after observing.

"How do you know? From the arrangement of these items, how can you tell they just left instead of leaving earlier?" Nan Gong Yu Yan was puzzled. To her, the office's items were merely disordered without any clear signs of when they left.

Su Nan Tian chuckled upon hearing this and pointed to a bottle of mineral water: "Look at this bottle. There's condensation on the surface, which proves it was moved from a warmer to a cooler temperature—or vice versa. Thus, they must have just left. If they had been gone longer, this condensation would have already dripped away."

Upon hearing Su Nan Tian's explanation, Nan Gong Yu Yan glanced at the bottle. Indeed, as Su Nan Tian said, it was covered in dense water droplets.

Nan Gong Yu Yan could not help but be impressed by Su Nan Tian's perceptiveness. If it were hot water still emitting steam, she might have noticed, but she had never considered this aspect.

"Yet even if you know this is impressive, it's of no use. Even if we know they just left and heard our arrival, where have they gone? The most important thing is not when they left but where they are."

For Nan Gong Yu Yan, knowing when they left was useless. Only by finding out where they had gone would it be useful, as her对接 (handover) required locating people—not just the port's goods.

In fact, Wu Chuan wanted to make them wait. He knew Nan Gong Yu Yan would arrive early, as the process of对接 (handover) with the inland port was extremely complicated. If they started early, it might take a whole day to complete.

But if Wu Chuan deliberately dragged them, having the workers hide until near closing time, they would have to wait until tomorrow.

Su Nan Tian nodded, acknowledging that his words had little practical use.

"They must have found a place where they could all stay comfortably without being disturbed. If they were to stay for a long time, they wouldn't choose a terrible place. But outside this inland port is the dock and containers—apart from this office, where else could they go?"

Nan Gong Yu Yan said this while making a puzzled expression.

Chapter 550: Search

Nan Gong Yu Yan's guess was indeed correct, but for them now, finding such a place was extremely difficult. Outside the inland port's dock, there were no other places for them to hide. And the office was already empty.

It was clear these people were deliberately avoiding them, even having completed their work in advance to hide.

"Fu Chuan used such a method to hinder our对接 (handover). It's truly infuriating," Nan Gong Yu Yan said, his face showing a rare anger.

This was the first time Su Nan Tian had seen such an expression on Nan Gong Yu Yan's face, proving how angry this situation made her.

"They can't have left the inland port. They must be hiding nearby. Though the number and timing of ships entering are predetermined, sometimes emergencies occur. Thus, the inland port can't have no staff at all. They won't go far—they must be nearby, but finding them might be difficult."

Su Nan Tian continued observing the surroundings. The inland port's area was vast, stretching endlessly. The bodyguards he had sent out hadn't returned yet; they were searching everywhere.

"We must find a way. But with only ten of us, this vast inland port would take until nightfall to search thoroughly. By then, their goal of giving us a setback on the first day would be achieved, and we couldn't complete the handover normally. Regardless of anything, today's handover must succeed—don't let Fu Chuan break our morale."

Nan Gong Yu Yan said this while tightly clenching his fists.

After waiting for a while, the bodyguards Nan Gong Yu Yan had sent out returned. But upon seeing their expressions, Su Nan Tian knew none of them had found where these people were hiding.

"How did it go? Did you find their whereabouts?" Nan Gong Yu Yan asked, his face still showing hope.

But as Su Nan Tian had seen, these bodyguards shook their heads in frustration and replied: "Miss, we truly couldn't find where they are. We've checked every place we went to—there's no one here at all."

After hearing this, Nan Gong Yu Yan was utterly furious. He hadn't expected Fu Chuan to go so far as to leave no one for him, this was a complete display of authority.

In fact, Nan Gong Yu Yan and his group knew Fu Chuan wasn't against them taking over. He simply wanted to delay their time,磨 their temper—telling Nan Gong Yu Yan that the inland port's authority ultimately belonged to Wu Family.

After all, Fu Chuan and Nan Gong Yu Yan had already reached an agreement. The inland port's operating rights would eventually be handed over to the Nan Gong family this year, and they would have to do so in the future.

"You all go search again. No one should follow their previous routes—exchange with others." Thus, Nan Gong Yu Yan ordered his bodyguards to continue searching. He didn't believe he couldn't find these people with a thorough search.

Because Nan Gong Yu Yan was certain this group hadn't gone far. They must be hiding within the inland port, but since they weren't familiar with its terrain, they couldn't find them immediately. However, those who worked in the inland port would certainly be familiar with it—so they were hiding precisely to make Nan Gong Yu Yan unable to find them.

"Let alone the managers, even hundreds of loading workers disappeared without a trace. I truly admire Fu Chuan," Nan Gong Yu Yan said, but this was not genuine praise—it was mockery.

"He's so smart, yet he couldn't control them. He had to find a puppet to achieve his goals. His talent is truly wasted," Nan Gong Yu Yan said, growing more angry and returning to the issue of Wu Family.

At this moment, Su Nan Tian was merely gazing around, deep in thought.

After Nan Gong Yu Yan said those words, he noticed no one was responding. He turned to see what Su Nan Tian was doing and found him with a serious expression, as if thinking deeply. He asked: "Nan Tian, what are you thinking about?"

Upon hearing Nan Gong Yu Yan's question, Su Nan Tian honestly shared his thoughts: "I think the place they're hiding must be one where they can know whether we've left at any time. Even if they were in another place and monitored us before our arrival, hiding beforehand—have you considered when we left, and how they knew? Would they just stay hidden until nightfall before coming out?"

Nan Gong Yu Yan thought Su Nan Tian's analysis was reasonable, but he couldn't figure out where they were hiding.

"You're right, but what's the use of analyzing this? We need to know where they are, not how they're hiding or how they know when we leave. So thinking about this now is useless. According to common sense, it's impossible for such a vast inland port to stop operating in one day. I hadn't expected Fu Chuan to be so ruthless, having the workers finish their tasks in advance. Look at these containers neatly arranged here—it's truly laughable."

Nan Gong Yu Yan said this while pointing to the containers piled up beside them. This was common in inland ports, where cargo from ships would be unloaded directly and stored here waiting to be picked up.

Upon hearing this, Su Nan Tian felt an idea form in his mind, though he wasn't sure. He looked at the containers beside him, hoping to find some clues. If his idea was correct, he would surely notice something different.

Chapter 551: A Small Strategy

Nan Gong Yu Yan also noticed Su Nan Tian's unease and asked, "What's wrong? Did you find something suspicious?"

Su Nan Tian nodded and pointed to the containers beside them: "Don't you think these containers' positions are a bit strange? Look at this area—this should be where the containers are usually placed."

After saying that, Su Nan Tian suddenly thought of something and took out his phone to search for information about the inland port online.

Such inland ports had their own websites, and usually, photos of the port were posted there.

After opening this website, Su Nan Tian found it was different from the photo. The photo also showed their office building, but there were no containers in front of it.

"Can a container hold how many people?" Su Nan Tian suddenly asked.

Upon hearing this, Nan Gong Yu Yan immediately understood his meaning. Su Nan Tian was telling her that these people were likely hiding in the containers. And these containers could indeed hide people—setting up some facilities would make it possible for short-term stays without human reactions.

Moreover, if Fu Chuan had prepared in advance, he could modify these containers slightly to allow them to live there for a long time.

Plus, people had slept in cargo containers before, so hiding people inside was not against common sense.

"Miss, have one of the bodyguards who went to search take photos of these containers. Especially focus on the entrance," Su Nan Tian said to Nan Gong Yu Yan.

Although Nan Gong Yu Yan didn't yet understand the purpose of taking these photos, she knew Su Nan Tian would surely find something from them. She immediately agreed and called one of the bodyguards on her phone.

"Take a 360-degree photo of the container and send it to me immediately," Nan Gong Yu Yan said, then hung up.

Not long after, Nan Gong Yu Yan's phone received the photos taken by the bodyguard. She immediately handed her phone to Su Nan Tian and said, "I had them take the photos back. Look at it."

Su Nan Tian took Nan Gong Yu Yan's phone and carefully examined the photos, then looked at the nearby containers. He couldn't help but smile.

Nan Gong Yu Yan was puzzled by Su Nan Tian's laughter and asked, "What are you laughing at? Did you find something?"

Su Nan Tian immediately enlarged the photo on Nan Gong Yu Yan's phone and pointed to a spot, saying, "Look here, then look at these containers. Did you notice anything different?"

Upon hearing this, Nan Gong Yu Yan approached and looked at the enlarged photo.

After looking at the photo and then the nearby containers, Nan Gong Yu Yan suddenly realized.

"These containers have locks, while these nearby ones don't. That means they might be inside. Your idea is that they're hiding in these containers," Nan Gong Yu Yan said excitedly, feeling more and more convinced that Su Nan Tian's reasoning was correct.

"Yes. These goods will eventually be handed over to others. Before that, they must lock them up. But these containers outside aren't locked—because all of them are inside. If they were locked, no one could open it for them, and they would be trapped inside," Su Nan Tian said while smiling slyly.

"But there are many containers here. I see none of them are locked, but they can't all be spread out. How do we find them?" Nan Gong Yu Yan frowned and asked another question.

Su Nan Tian smiled and said, "It's simple. We just need to lock them,"

Nan Gong Yu Yan immediately called her bodyguards back and had them go buy dozens of locks from outside.

After the bodyguards bought all the locks, Nan Gong Yu Yan loudly told them: "We came here today and found no one. They must be resting, but there are many containers without locks. I'm afraid the goods inside might be stolen. We can't let this happen when we take over the inland port. So everyone, use our locks to secure these containers. When someone comes to collect them, they'll contact us, and then we'll open the boxes. Everyone, get to work!"

After Nan Gong Yu Yan said this, the bodyguards were all excited and loudly agreed. Each took a lock and locked the nearby containers that weren't secured.

At this moment, Su Nan Tian also used his hearing to its fullest, listening for sounds around him. He was certain that the words Nan Gong Yu Yan had just said were heard by them, so he was discerning directions to find where they were hiding.

Finally, at this moment, Su Nan Tian heard someone speaking. This voice was very faint for Nan Gong Yu Yan's group to hear, but Su Nan Tian could indeed hear it.

A middle-aged man said: "How did I just hear them say they're going to lock these containers? How will we get out then? Even if we could call someone, they wouldn't have the key. We can't just report this to the police, right?"

" I also heard that. Let's try pushing the door and see if it can open? Also, I think I heard someone moving this container," another person added.

"You're all so impatient. They're just trying to trick us. If they knew we were here, they'd immediately complete the handover and get scolded by their superiors. You think we wanted to hide here? It's not that they're angry and don't want us to hand over, but we have to do it the moment they arrive."

After hearing this, Nan Gong Yu Yan understood. It turned out that Fu Chuan had been pressuring them all along. In fact, these workers were the same no matter who they worked for; as long as their income wasn't affected, they would smoothly allow the handover. But Fu Chuan had forced them to hide deliberately, apparently controlling their wages.

Chapter 552: Strategy Upgrade

At this moment, Nan Gong Yu Yan said to Su Nan Tian: "We just need to stay here now. If they realize they're locked, they'll definitely try to open the door. We'll see which side has people and then unlock the locks to let them out."

Su Nan Tian, however, shook his head, as if he didn't agree with Nan Gong Yu Yan's suggestion.

Nan Gong Yu Yan was puzzled and said, "Why? You don't agree? Then why did you have me buy locks? Buying locks was for this purpose, right?"

Su Nan Tian smiled slyly and said, "This is the simplest method. Once we let them out, they must hand over with us. But if I have a way to humiliate Fu Chuan and complete today's handover, would you be willing?"

Su Nan Tian wasn't sure whether Nan Gong Yu Yan would agree. After all, they were currently in a partnership with the Wu family. He wasn't sure if Nan Gong Yu Yan would be willing to set a trap for Fu Chuan this time.

Nan Gong Yu Yan thought for a while and then said, "Tell me, what's the other way? And make sure Fu Chuan will come."

"Of course," Su Nan Tian glanced around and said to Nan Gong Yu Yan, "Let our people hide somewhere. When they hear us leaving, they'll eventually try to open the door. Then when they can't open it, they'll call for help. At that point, the entire inland port will be unable to operate. Fu Chuan himself will definitely come. When he arrives, we'll open the door and emerge to catch him in a trap."

After Su Nan Tian said this, Nan Gong Yu Yan's eyes lit up. He hadn't expected such a good method and laughed while pointing at Su Nan Tian: "You really have a lot of tricks. If Fu Chuan knew this idea was yours, he'd definitely hate you."

"Don't care if the plan is bad or not. It's the best one to deal with this situation. Besides, Fu Chuan gave us a setback first. Although the two families are currently in partnership, he used this method to give us a display of authority. Shouldn't we retaliate slightly?"

Su Nan Tian said this quite naturally. Moreover, this matter wasn't really a big deal for Fu Chuan—it was just making him run a little and lose face. This actually caused no harm to Fu Chuan, so he wouldn't pursue it.

"Then we'll do it your way," Nan Gong Yu Yan said and immediately gathered all the bodyguards, whispering the plan to them. Upon hearing this, each bodyguard was very excited and nodded in agreement that they would cooperate.

After completing all the plans, Nan Gong Yu Yan cleared his throat and said: "Alright, since everyone has locked these containers, it seems no one is here. We'll come back tomorrow. Maybe we can catch up early tomorrow. Alright, let's go back."

Nan Gong Yu Yan spoke as loudly as possible, almost shouting the words so that those hiding in the containers could hear them.

Then they left this place, but actually went to another location to hide, waiting for the people in the containers to call Fu Chuan over. Then they would come out and discuss with Fu Chuan.

At this moment, the people inside the containers were also alert. Su Nan Tian could hear what they said.

"You heard it, they said they're leaving. Can we go out now?" One person walked to the door and tried to open it, but after taking two steps, he was pulled back by someone beside him.

"Don't rush. Be careful. They might be faking it. Maybe they're still outside waiting for us to go out. Wait a little longer. If there's no movement, we can go out."

Another person said carefully, fearing a trick. He didn't want to finish Fu Chuan's mission.

"Let's wait a little longer. After all, it's not so bad in here. Wait another ten minutes or so; it's no big deal."

"Yes, just wait a little longer," others also agreed.

However, after nearly ten minutes, these people finally couldn't wait. One person said: "It's been ten minutes already. I haven't heard any movement outside. They must have really left."

"Then we'll go out," another person said and walked to the door, trying to push it open.

But at this moment, he found that the container's door couldn't be opened.

"What... what's going on? I can't open this container's door. Did they really lock it?"

Upon hearing this, another person came over, rolled up his sleeves to reveal his strong muscles and said: "Let me try. Maybe your strength is too small. If I can't open it either, then the door must be locked."

After saying this, he also pushed the door and found it couldn't open. Moreover, as he pushed the door, he could hear something making noise outside. He looked through the small gap in the door and saw that the connection was locked with a large lock.

"They really did lock it. I think other containers are probably the same,"

Upon hearing this, another person said: "Don't worry. Let's call the boss and have him send someone to cut the lock open."

After saying this, one person immediately called Fu Chuan and explained what had happened. Upon hearing this, Fu Chuan's assistant reported it to Fu Chuan.

"What? Nan Gong Yu Yan locked them inside?" Fu Chuan was shocked and slammed his newspaper on the table.

"They said because of what you told them to hide in containers, they couldn't find them. Finally, seeing these containers weren't locked, they didn't lock them themselves out of fear that goods would be stolen. Then they left saying they'd come back tomorrow to hand over. Originally, we thought it was a trick to get them out, but they actually locked them all in. We'll have to go and remove these locks today; otherwise, the entire day will be on strike."

Fu Chuan's assistant immediately described the situation.

Chapter 553: Appearance

After Fu Chuan heard about the situation, he couldn't help but laugh. "I don't know whether Nan Gong Yu Yan did it on purpose or by accident, but he locked all of them inside. I wanted to give him a display of authority yesterday by having them finish their work quickly, so they could hide for a day or two.

But now he locked them inside. If there's work in the afternoon, what will happen? The entire inland port would be ruined. We Wu family would lose credibility.

Quickly, get people and tools and go to the inland port."

Fu Chuan's assistant immediately started mobilizing people and brought along electric saws, heading toward the inland port.

Everything went as Su Nan Tian had predicted. Fu Chuan personally came to the inland port with his people.

At this moment, Su Nan Tian and others were hiding behind a container. If anyone came this way, they couldn't see them, but from their vantage point, they could observe Fu Chuan's direction.

"Here they come," one of the bodyguards scouting said to them.

"Stay calm. Wait until Fu Chuan opens all the containers' locks and releases the people, then we'll come out," Su Nan Tian told them.

Initially, these bodyguards had no good impression of Su Nan Tian. They were under Zhang Yu's command, and Zhang Yu had been beaten into the hospital by Su Nan Tian. Thus, they didn't have any goodwill toward Su Nan Tian.

However, this time it was Nan Gong Yu Yan who specifically requested Su Nan Tian to join them. So they didn't show any hostility toward him on the surface. But after Su Nan Tian came up with a plan, each of them felt excited and gradually realized that Su Nan Tian was indeed intelligent and skilled. Their opinion of him slowly changed.

However, at this moment, they saw Fu Chuan leading his people. Each carried an electric saw and began searching for the containers locked by Nan Gong Yu Yan, then cutting through their locks with electric saws.

Numerous sparks flashed continuously. Countless sparks glittered. The locks Nan Gong Yu Yan had bought were large and thick, so even with an electric saw, it took about ten minutes to cut through.

Finally, they heard the sound of "clang," which was Fu Chuan's people cutting through one lock. The sound of the lock head hitting the ground was very loud.

At the same time, others also cut through their locks. The people hiding in the containers finally could come out.

The number of people was truly astonishing. After all, it's an inland port, so there were many workers. Hundreds of people came out from the containers.

Nan Gong Yu Yan and his group had originally thought only a few of these unlocked containers had people inside, but they hadn't expected all the workers in the inland port were hiding there.

But it made sense. If they hadn't hidden inside, where else could they go? And Fu Chuan's arrival showed that they would still work in the afternoon. These people could only hide here to conveniently complete their afternoon tasks. If they went elsewhere, they would have to return later, wasting a lot of time.

"Master has released everyone. No one was injured. Everyone is fine," Fu Chuan's assistant said after counting the people and told Fu Chuan.

Upon hearing this, Fu Chuan nodded and waved to all the workers in front of him. "Thank you for your hard work. I hadn't expected they would lock you inside. Everyone rest a little, and then do your work in the afternoon. I'll take responsibility for today's incident and give you overtime pay as compensation."

Fu Chuan knew these people would not pursue the matter once they heard about the overtime pay. Moreover, they hadn't been harmed inside the containers. Although ventilation was poor, it wouldn't suffocate them for a while. For these workers, this was tolerable.

Moreover, they could get money without working in the morning. For these workers, it was already enough.

Indeed, after Fu Chuan said this, the workers' faces showed very excited expressions. They had completely forgotten their anger about being locked in containers.

"Uncle Wu, you finally came. I tried to对接 (handover) but couldn't find anyone. How did you put them in containers?"

At this moment, Fu Chuan suddenly heard a familiar voice. When he turned around, he saw Nan Gong Yu Yan and his bodyguards coming out from behind another container. They must have been waiting here to ambush him.

Fu Chuan's mind "buzzed," and he felt anger, but his remaining sense told him he couldn't get angry. After all, Nan Gong Yu Yan hadn't done anything wrong; it was his side that had set up this trap to give her a display of authority.

Thus, Fu Chuan could only force out an ugly smile and said: "Ah, Miss Nan Gong, what are you doing here? I thought you had left. My workers said it seemed like you locked the containers?"

"I came here to hand over, but I hadn't expected anyone was missing. I sent people to search around and found a few containers weren't locked, while the others were all secured. I was afraid that if no one was here, the goods would be stolen. If losses occurred, it would belong to your family since I hadn't completed the handover yet."
