"Speaking of which, Nan Gong Lin patted Nan Gong Ping's shoulder and continued, 'So there's no need to fear or panic. Do what you wish.'

Chapter 639: Wetland Bidding

Nan Gong Ping's hesitation regarding this collaboration is understandable, for he must contend with a figure of Wu Family's patriarchal level. It's natural for him to feel nervous.

Previously, the business deals Nan Gong Ping resolved were mostly with external partners whose power paled in comparison to the Nan Gong Clan. However, although the Wu Family isn't as powerful as the Nan Gongs among the five major clans, they are undeniably affluent. Thus, it's impossible for them to fight to the death; hence, Nan Gong Ping naturally hesitates in his dealings.

"You must maintain composure and dignity during this business negotiation. Although Wu Chuan is one rank above you, remember that you may become the next Nan Gong Clan head. Therefore, there's no need to be overly tense when facing Wu Chuan. Conduct business as usual—prioritize profit over status."

Nan Gong Lin personally imparted this attitude to Nan Gong Ping. Su Nantian, listening in, nodded in agreement. Indeed, as the head of the Nan Gong Clan, Nan Gong Lin's expertise in such matters was undeniable; otherwise, he wouldn't have single-handedly rebuilt the Nan Gong Clan into its current state.

"Father, I understand. Rest assured, I will maintain composure. Wu Chuan is indeed one rank older than me; naturally, I'll treat him with the courtesy of an uncle. However, in business matters, I won't allow myself to be overshadowed. I'll uphold the necessary etiquette but will never yield on profit."

Nan Gong Ping said this, and Nan Gong Lin nodded in approval.

"You've spoken well. Proceed with this attitude. Today, I summoned you to discuss the details of this collaboration. Up until now, the plan has remained confidential. Since it's being entrusted to you, it's time to reveal it."

After saying this, Nan Gong Lin pulled out a file from his side and tossed it onto Nan Gong Ping's desk.

Nan Gong Ping immediately opened the file, discovering it contained a bidding proposal.

"Is this the 'Wetland Development Bidding Plan?' Nan Gong Ping asked, raising an eyebrow after glancing at the title.

His reaction was unsurprising. Su Nantian, seated nearby, also glanced at the proposal's title. Such a wetland development bidding project should involve connections with higher authorities, so why would it require cooperation with the Wu Family? Even Su Nantian was puzzled.

"Father, if I'm not mistaken, such wetland development projects should involve contact with higher authorities. What does it have to do with the Wu Family?" Nan Gong Ping's question mirrored Su Nantian's confusion.

"You're correct. This wetland development plan requires us to bid with the authorities; they'll assign the project to us if our conditions meet their standards. However, I must say, with our current strength, it's difficult to monopolize this wetland development plan alone. But no one else can monopolize it either. Thus, if we collaborate with the Wu Family, we can easily secure this project."

Upon hearing Nan Gong Lin's words, Su Nantian immediately understood. However, since Nan Gong Ping was still speaking, he refrained from interjecting. Though Nan Gong Lin had accepted Su Nantian and acknowledged his talent, this was a test for Nan Gong Ping. If he interfered, Nan Gong Lin would be displeased; after all, this was an opportunity to train Nan Gong Ping.

"So your intention is for us to collaborate with the Wu Family and bid as a single entity? Naturally, the Wu Family would agree. What exactly do I need to do?" Nan Gong Ping asked, still confused about the specifics.

"This collaboration differs from previous ones. We must first unite with the Wu Family to bid against our rivals, securing this project before engaging in internal conflict. The distribution of profits and funding details must be discussed later. Thus, this collaboration has two stages, each with its own challenges. Do you understand now?"

After Nan Gong Lin's explanation, Nan Gong Ping fully grasped the situation.

"This is indeed a complex and challenging collaboration. Father, rest assured I won't disappoint your expectations. I'll bring you good news."

Though Nan Gong Ping felt the collaboration was difficult, he had to maintain composure. He needed to make bold promises first; otherwise, his father would scold him for lack of confidence.

"Maintaining determination is good, but don't be careless. Initially, we and the Wu Family are on the same side, yet surrounded by strong enemies. Besides us and the Wu Family, other clans will surely unite against us. Thus, you'll face formidable opponents. The second stage involves our clan's internal conflicts—profit distribution will be even more ruthless, and Wu Chuan's temperament is well-known to me. Thus, this will be a fierce battle for you. However, you needn't concern yourself with the second stage yet; first, secure this bid. Only then will we have leverage for further discussions."

Nan Gong Lin spoke, then suddenly coughed as if unwell. Yet he quickly suppressed the cough.

Nan Gong Ping, hearing the cough, felt no unease. In his mind, Nan Gong Lin's health was still robust; after all, he was only in his fifties, a man at the peak of his vigor.

"Alright, since you understand, I'll say no more. The detailed content is all in this bidding document. I've already had the housekeeper pack additional materials; you can retrieve them directly from him. I won't elaborate further. Go study it first, and preparations will proceed smoothly."

After finishing his words, Nan Gong Lin waved his hand, signaling the two to leave.

Chapter 640: Perception

As Su Nantian and Nan Gong Ping left, Nan Gong Ping remained unaware of his father's physical discomfort. However, Su Nantian had already sensed something amiss.

Moreover, upon recalling the handwriting on the document Nan Gong Lin had written earlier, he noticed it was uneven. Perhaps this was due to his father's illness.

Yet Su Nantian dared not confirm it, for Nan Gong Lin was a shrewd man. Perhaps this was merely a test of his loyalty. Thus, Su Nantian chose to ignore it. After all, Nan Gong Lin's health was irrelevant to him; his goal was merely to connect with the Wu Family. Whether Nan Gong Lin lived or died held no significance for him.

After retrieving the wetland bidding documents from the housekeeper, Su Nantian and Nan Gong Ping returned to their villa to study the materials.

"Although this wetland is located in the suburbs of the capital, land there has become as valuable as gold. This wetland's suburban area will be a key administrative focus within the next five years. Thus, if we secure this bid, the wetland's value will surely double—and likely more."

After reviewing most of the documents, Nan Gong Ping concluded this.

This conclusion naturally impressed Su Nantian. A place like Ruhai District, occupying a prime location in the capital, was rendered unusable due to the Sea Dragon Gang's presence. This was an extraordinary phenomenon. Even Su Nantian, who had personally seen the area's conditions, would have found it hard to believe such a place existed. Even online reports about it seemed fabricated.

"Thus, this wetland's value is extremely high. Our competitors must be formidable. Not only will several major clans bid, but merchants from other regions may also participate."

Su Nantian's words suddenly made him realize something. If so, he could have Qi Yinzhen use his company's name to bid, allowing the secret agent organization to discreetly send capable assistants. This would make rescuing Wu Taotao and Wu You'er more successful.

Moreover, this wasn't a competition with the Nan Gong Clan; it was merely an excuse to bring people in. The wetland bidding plan would still belong to the Nan Gong Clan.

"You're right. Thus, we have two hurdles. If we can't overcome the first, there's no hope for the second. We must thoroughly understand these documents and then approach the Wu Family. This collaboration requires coordination, so for now, we must unite against external forces and secure the bid first."

Though Nan Gong Ping was mediocre, he understood basic business knowledge. After all, he had grown up in the Nan Gong Clan and wasn't entirely useless. However, his talent was ordinary, indistinguishable from an average person.

In a regular society, this wouldn't matter. But in the Nan Gong Clan, as the son of Nan Gong Lin, such talent was insufficient.

If someone like Nan Gong Lin could find a counterpart to Su Nantian, it would be fine for Nan Gong Ping to navigate this generation smoothly.

Yet who could match Su Nantian's talent? Such a person would never submit to another. Though he might seize an opportunity to establish his own path, Nan Gong Ping's personality would struggle to control such a figure.

Thus, if Su Nantian were Nan Gong Lin, he would never pass the clan headship to Nan Gong Ping. Instead, he'd choose Wu Yu Yan. He knew Nan Gong Lin's concerns well, but after weighing the options, he still believed entrusting the clan to Wu Yu Yan was the wisest choice.

However, as Su Nantian and Nan Gong Ping were studying the wetland bidding plan, Wu Chuan was also examining related matters at the Wu Family.

"Master, I'm here to report on the inland port situation." At this moment, an assistant entered and said.

Though the Wu Family had handed over the inland port to the Nan Gong Clan, they still closely monitored its developments. After all, despite only a year having passed, they intended to reclaim the inland port in the future. Thus, Wu Chuan needed complete control over all information regarding the inland port.

"Speak. What's the situation now? Have they completed their task?"

Wu Chuan knew well about the Nan Gong Clan's plan to restructure the inland port's power. He hadn't intervened, as it posed no harm to him—or perhaps benefited the Wu Family in the future.

Because he was aware of the local gang's situation at the inland port, and the Wu Family had given them generous rewards. Yet these local gangs grew bolder instead.

Thus, when an outsider took action against them, Wu Chuan was willing to let it happen. This way, he wouldn't offend these gangs directly and could still teach them a lesson.

"They've compromised. Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo have both given in. Now, the inland port's power is mainly controlled by Li Zhe's faction. Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo have a small remaining group, and both sides are evenly matched. They've also redefined the distribution of illicit goods; the Nan Gong Clan now receives more than before."

"What? They've compromised so quickly? No wonder the Nan Gong Clan has started moving on our next plan. I thought it was because the bidding deadline was approaching, but now I see they've already resolved the inland port issue. However, Nan Gong Lin's daughter has remarkable skills; she managed to subdue these local gangs so effectively. And in just a year, she's made such a bold move, investing heavily to change the situation. I admire her courage."

Wu Chuan said this while smiling, unbothered by the situation.

"It seems the idea wasn't Nan Gong Yu Yan's, but someone else."

Chapter 641: Calculations

Wu Chuan had initially thought the person who stirred up the inland port was Nan Gong Yu Yan herself. But upon hearing his assistant's words, it seemed there was another person involved.

"Wasn't it Nan Gong Yu Yan? You mean someone else? Could it be Nan Gong Lin's nephew, Nan Gong Fei?" Wu Chuan asked curiously. After all, he couldn't think of anyone else. Yet he felt Nan Gong Fei was unlikely.

Nan Gong Fei was well-known among the major clans as a failure. Some had previously lamented that besides Nan Gong Lin and Nan Gong Yu Yan, the Nan Gong Clan had no one capable of shouldering its burden.

"Of course, it couldn't be Nan Gong Fei, that failure. His failure is well-known; how could he suddenly become intelligent in such a short time?" Wu Chuan's assistant shook his head and replied.

"Then who is it? Don't beat around the bush; you're wasting my time." Wu Chuan said, growing impatient. He couldn't think of anyone else. If Nan Gong Xiaochu had suddenly appeared as a prodigy, it would be a crisis for them.

"It's not a member of the Nan Gong Clan but a bodyguard recently taken in by them—Nan Tian." Wu Chuan's assistant had thoroughly investigated every person at the inland port, so he naturally researched Nan Tian.

Moreover, Wu Chuan had publicly orchestrated these actions, making the investigation straightforward. However, they couldn't uncover Nan Tian's true identity; they only knew his surface-level details.

"Nan Tian, Nan Tian..." Wu Chuan muttered the name, as if it was familiar.

"Nan Tian! Yes, that's the bodyguard of the Nan Gong Clan. Do you remember when we held a banquet before, and Nan Gong Ping had a bodyguard with him? We even searched together. That man was named Nan Tian. I thought he was energetic and not ordinary; he might rise to a high position in the Nan Gong Clan. But I never thought he'd be so capable. I assumed he was just a regular bodyguard, but now the Nan Gong Clan has entrusted him with business matters."

At this point, Wu Chuan's expression changed, and a hint of surprise appeared on his face. "Investigate this boy a bit more. See how his relationship with the Nan Gong Clan stands. Although we're about to do business with them, the distribution of profits is the most critical part. If this boy can help us a little, it would be ideal."

"Master, I'll handle this immediately," Wu Chuan's assistant said after hearing Wu Chuan's words. He nodded respectfully and bowed before leaving Wu Chuan's room.

Not long after, Wu Chuan's assistant returned and said to him: "Master, I've followed your instructions and retrieved all the information on this boy. It's all here."

After saying this, Wu Chuan's assistant placed the file in front of Wu Chuan.

Then he said: "This Nan Tian seems very capable. He's only been with the Nan Gong Clan for a few months, yet he's already accomplished many things. Otherwise, Nan Gong Lin wouldn't have trusted him. Almost all affairs at the inland port were handled by him personally. Although Nan Gong Yu Yan holds a title, she only manages the overall strategy. The detailed matters were handled by this Nan Tian. And Nan Gong Fei was merely a figurehead, doing nothing."

"Moreover, this Nan Tian started as a bodyguard. After some time, he began to interfere with the business matters of the Nan Gong Clan. Though his official title was still a bodyguard, his status had changed significantly. And this time, our participation in the wetland bidding plan was likely due to Nan Gong Ping bringing him along."

As Wu Chuan's assistant spoke about Nan Tian, Wu Chuan briefly flipped through the file in front of him. However, after reading it, his brows furrowed and he said: "Are you sure this is his real information? It seems suspicious."

"It should be correct. The information given to you is genuine, as Nan Gong Lin had also sent people to investigate further. He felt this boy was somehow strange, but in the end, his information proved accurate."

Wu Chuan's assistant said this. Wu Chuan replied: "A person born in a small village having such courage and intelligence is truly astonishing."

"But Master, consider this: if his information is fake, it's actually an opportunity for us."

"What do you mean?" Wu Chuan asked, raising his eyebrows.

"If this Nan Tian's information is fake, it means he has ulterior motives for infiltrating the Nan Gong Clan. His identity and information are fake, but it doesn't harm us. He's targeting the Nan Gong Clan. Thus, if we want to cooperate with him secretly, it might be smoother. What do you think?"

"Brilliant! Your words are indeed correct. His information being fake doesn't target the Wu Clan; it's only aimed at the Nan Gong Clan. Thus, whether his identity is real or fake doesn't matter to us. Moreover, it might be an opportunity; he might even be willing to cooperate with us."

After hearing his assistant's words, Wu Chuan clapped his hands in delight. He felt his assistant was indeed correct. However, how could he know that Nan Tian's plan was a roundabout way to target the Wu Clan?

"Nevertheless, specific details need to be discussed later. At least we must meet his people first before deciding the next steps. The bidding meeting is in two days; before that, we must at least arrange a meeting with Nan Gong Ping. Now, use my name to send an invitation to Nan Gong Fei, inviting Nan Gong Ping over. Mainly to discuss the wetland bidding plan. If Nan Gong Lin truly trusts this Nan Tian, he'll naturally send him along with Nan Gong Ping."

After saying this, Wu Chuan waved his hand, signaling his assistant to act immediately.

Chapter 642: Intentional

Soon after, Nan Gong Ping received an invitation from Wu Chuan. Since this matter had been fully entrusted to him by Nan Gong Lin, he directly handled the communication with Wu Chuan.

"Master Wu Chuan has sent a message; he's inviting us to his home tomorrow to discuss the wetland bidding plan," Nan Gong Ping said to Su Nantian, who was by his side. They were currently reviewing the wetland bidding documents. Unexpectedly, Wu Chuan had invited them so quickly.

"He might be trying to gauge our strength. However, it's not important. If we meet, then let's meet," Su Nantian said, unbothered, and nodded.

"I just feel a bit uncertain. Previously, I've met Wu Chuan alone, but it wasn't for business matters. So anything was fine as long as the etiquette was observed. But tomorrow's meeting is for business, and every detail must be perfect. Wu Chuan is very experienced; I feel uneasy."

Nan Gong Ping said this while patting his chest. Naturally, he felt some nervousness. He had met Wu Chuan before and spent time with him, but that wasn't for business matters. Thus, he didn't feel pressured. However, now the pressure was significant.

"Approach it with a calm mindset. Wu Chuan is one rank older than you, so his experience in business makes him more skilled while we are inexperienced. This is quite natural and no one would mock you for it. On the contrary, if Wu Chuan uses this to deceive us intentionally, he would be ridiculed. Moreover, this wetland bidding plan must be reported to the authorities; Wu Chuan's side definitely won't interfere. First, we must unite and secure this bid together. As for the later stages, that's when the real battle begins."

Su Nantian saw through this matter clearly. He knew Nan Gong Ping's nervousness stemmed from his inexperience and the fact that he was aware of his own inadequacy compared to his father, Nan Gong Lin. Thus, when facing someone like Wu Chuan, he naturally felt uneasy.

"Moreover, tomorrow is just a meeting; it's only about discussing the bidding plan and not the final decision," Su Nantian said again, seeing Nan Gong Ping's tense expression.

However, this matter was quite exciting for Su Nantian, as it meant he had the opportunity to enter the Wu Clan and possibly meet Wu You'er.

This was why Su Nantian had insisted on accompanying Nan Gong Ping in this matter. It seemed his future interactions with the Wu Clan would only increase, though not every time he could visit. But as long as he had the chance to connect with the Wu Clan, he would have more opportunities to rescue Wu Taotao and Wu You'er.

"You're right; I was too nervous. A person who achieves great things doesn't dwell on minor details. If I'm so timid about this, the subsequent matters would be hard to handle. Tomorrow is just a meeting; don't show weakness."

Nan Gong Ping said this while clenching his fist, showing how much he cared about the matter.

"Alright, it's late; let's go back and prepare. We'll leave early tomorrow morning for the Wu Clan." Nan Gong Ping patted Su Nantian's shoulder and said.

"Okay, you should also rest early; there's no need to worry too much." After saying this, Su Nantian returned to his room.

He had now roughly understood the details of this wetland bidding plan and had time—half a month until the actual bidding. Thus, he immediately sent this information to Qi Yinzhen.

He asked Qi Yinzhen to participate in the bidding under his company's name, not aiming for success but merely to create a fake proposal to secure the bidding qualification.

The actual plan was for Su Nantian to have the secret agent organization openly arrive in the capital, ensuring that if anyone investigated their background, it would appear legitimate.

After contacting Qi Yinzhen, Su Nantian immediately entered a restful state. After all, tomorrow he would visit the Wu Clan and might find an opportunity to meet Wu You'er. Thus, Su Nantian needed to rest well, both physically and mentally, to maintain peak condition.

The next morning, Su Nantian and Nan Gong Ping arrived at the Wu Clan. When they met Wu Chuan, he was still wearing a nightgown and sitting in the dining room having breakfast.

Su Nantian immediately realized Wu Chuan was giving Nan Gong Ping a warning by wearing his nightgown. The time was set by Wu Chuan, and he had invited them; he should have known the time. Yet instead of preparing early, he continued eating breakfast, clearly intending to leave Nan Gong Ping and Su Nantian waiting.

"Ah! Master Nan Gong, you've come. I must have mixed up the time; I thought you'd arrive later. My breakfast hasn't finished yet. You don't mind, do you?" Wu Chuan clapped his forehead, feigning regret as if he had truly mixed up the time.

"No problem; we don't mind, Master Wu. Please continue eating," Nan Gong Ping smiled and said. What else could he say? Would he dare to scold Wu Chuan?

"Master Nan Gong left early today and didn't eat breakfast. If Master Wu doesn't mind, could you prepare a breakfast for our master as well?"

However, Su Nantian spoke this way. His words were truthful; the time was set too early, and traveling from the Nan Gong Clan to the Wu Clan took some time. Thus, he and Nan Gong Ping hadn't eaten breakfast.

Upon hearing this, Wu Chuan looked up at Su Nantian and realized he was the person they had discussed earlier.

"Of course, no problem. The kitchen is still preparing. Here, prepare two breakfasts for Master Nan Gong and this gentleman to share with me."

Wu Chuan told the servant nearby, who immediately agreed and went to the kitchen. Not long after, two breakfasts were brought over—identical to Wu Chuan's.

Thus, Su Nantian and Nan Gong Ping sat down at the breakfast table with Wu Chuan to share their meal.

Chapter 643: Reencounter with Wu You'er

During the shared breakfast, Wu Chuan didn't say much but chatted about recent events without mentioning the wetland bidding plan.

Nan Gong Ping was somewhat anxious, but he knew to stay still if the enemy didn't move. Since Wu Chuan hadn't brought it up, he wouldn't bring it up first.

Moreover, Su Nantian had specifically told him on the car ride that he should let Wu Chuan initiate the discussion. Although it was a collaboration, the Nan Gong Clan must maintain a higher position.

Additionally, the Wu Family's strength alone couldn't complete this wetland bidding project. The Nan Gong Clan could have secured it on their own, but due to subsequent resource and operational issues, they chose a partner.

Thus, in this matter, the attitude must be that the Wu Family approached the Nan Gong Clan. It was absolutely unacceptable for this situation to reverse due to the fact that the Nan Gong Clan's representative was a junior, Nan Gong Ping.

Therefore, Su Nantian and Nan Gong Ping immediately feigned disinterest in the matter, waiting for Wu Chuan to speak first.

After finishing breakfast, Wu Chuan immediately invited Su Nantian and Nan Gong Ping to his study, indicating he was about to seriously discuss the wetland bidding plan.

After sitting down, Wu Chuan smiled and said: "I'm sure you two understand why I invited you today. It's to discuss the collaboration between the Nan Gong Clan and our Wu Family on this project. This project is indeed significant. If it were solely the Wu Family's strength, we couldn't undertake such a project. Thus, I'm grateful that the Nan Gong Clan chose us first for this collaboration."

Unexpectedly, Wu Chuan's attitude was quite good. This surprised Su Nantian, who had expected Wu Chuan to continue giving Nan Gong Ping a warning as he did in the morning. However, his tone shifted immediately to one of humility.

"Of course, we've already discussed the conditions for Master Wu Chuan's election as clan head. We had previously stated that we would prioritize cooperation with the Wu Family under any circumstances, to consolidate and deepen our friendship. Thus, this wetland park bidding is the best opportunity for our collaboration."

Nan Gong Ping had felt some trepidation upon arriving at the Wu Family today. However, after finishing breakfast, his slight anxiety had somewhat subsided.

"Regarding the election of the clan head, I must thank the Nan Gong Clan for their strong support, which has led to the current flourishing state of the Wu Family. Moreover, regarding this matter, I must say a few words: this won't be solely my appearance. Our new clan head will also participate in this matter. However, rest assured, the main power remains with me; he'll merely be an observer."

Wu Chuan's words were clear. His current status wasn't that of the Wu Family clan head; officially, Wu You'er was still the clan head. Thus, this matter required Wu You'er to be present publicly; otherwise, people would think Wu Chuan's status was no different from a clan member. This could provide opportunities and leverage for criticism.

However, upon hearing these words, Su Nantian was stunned. He hadn't expected this good fortune to arrive so suddenly. He had previously thought about how to gain more opportunities to meet Wu You'er, but now the good news had been delivered directly to his doorstep.

If he were only cooperating with Wu Chuan, it wouldn't have allowed him to visit the Wu Family every moment. However, if only Wu You'er participated in this matter, they would have ample opportunities to meet. After all, the official clan head must be present as an observer.

"This is no problem; we have no objections. If the Wu Family's clan head wishes to participate in this matter, it is reasonable." Nan Gong Ping nodded and said.

However, neither Nan Gong Ping nor Wu Chuan knew how excited Su Nantian was at that moment.

"Then, I'll have someone call him over. After all, we'll need to meet for the next period. Today is also a good opportunity to introduce each other."

Upon receiving Nan Gong Ping's approval, Wu Chuan nodded and smiled, then called for his assistant outside.

"Go fetch the clan head; this collaboration between our Wu Family and Nan Gong Clan requires his participation."

"Master, I'll go fetch the clan head. Please wait a moment," Wu Chuan's assistant nodded and immediately left the study.

"Then, please wait a moment; we'll discuss this matter after the Wu Family's clan head arrives."

Not long after, Su Nantian could hear footsteps approaching from outside—two people walking in a line toward Wu Chuan's study.

This was undoubtedly Wu Chuan's assistant and Wu You'er. Su Nantian's excitement nearly overflowed from his chest, but he controlled himself and didn't show excessive excitement on his face.

After a moment, the door knocked, and Wu Chuan immediately let them in. Indeed, it was Wu Chuan's assistant, who had brought Wu You'er behind him.

Upon entering, Wu You'er immediately recognized Su Nantian's disguised appearance. They had met before, so Wu You'er could still identify him as Su Nantian.

At this moment, Su Nantian also winked at Wu You'er, signaling they had already communicated secretly.

After Wu Chuan's assistant brought Wu You'er in, he left, and Wu Chuan waved his hand for Wu You'er to sit.

"Come here and sit down; I'll introduce you."

Wu You'er nodded obediently and walked to the chair beside Wu Chuan.

"We are collaborating with the Nan Gong Clan on a wetland park bidding project, so I've invited two representatives from the Nan Gong Clan to discuss this matter. This is your first project as clan head, and it's a collaboration with the Nan Gong Clan. Thus, it holds great significance. As clan head, you must participate personally to gain experience and enrich your understanding."

Wu Chuan's words sounded grand, but in reality, whether Wu You'er could gain experience was irrelevant to him.

Chapter 644: Silent Game

After Wu Chuan spoke, he pointed to Nan Gong Ping and Su Nantian and said: "This is Master Nan Gong, Nan Gong Ping. And this gentleman is Master Nan Gong's assistant, Nan Tian. This project collaboration will be directly handled by the two of you with us. Master Nan Gong is young but already shoulders the responsibilities of the Nan Gong Clan, which is a blessing for Shenyang Apartment."

After saying this, Wu Chuan shifted his tone and began praising Nan Gong Ping. This left Nan Gong Ping confused; he had expected Wu Chuan to continue giving him a warning and displaying an attitude, but instead, he changed his approach.

"By the way, let me introduce you to two people. This is our new clan head of the Nan Gong Clan, Wu You'er. His father was my adopted brother. However, he left the Nan Gong Clan due to family pressure at a young age. This time, because our Nan Gong Clan has too few people with the main lineage bloodline, I consulted their opinions and brought her back."

Wu Chuan's words sounded grand, but he had forced Wu You'er to comply by holding back Wu Taotao and Wu You'er. Both Wu You'er and Su Nantian knew this, so they naturally understood that Wu Chuan was lying.

However, neither of them exposed him, as this issue wasn't important at the moment.

"Alright, we've introduced everyone. Everyone now knows each other. After all, the collaboration requires you to move forward together. Moreover, I heard Master Nan Gong Ping is still single. Wu You'er is also single. If you two have mutual feelings, you can get to know each other."

After saying this, Wu Chuan laughed heartily, making Nan Gong Ping slightly embarrassed.

However, the subsequent process was normal. Su Nantian, Nan Gong Ping, and Wu Chuan began discussing the wetland park bidding plan.
