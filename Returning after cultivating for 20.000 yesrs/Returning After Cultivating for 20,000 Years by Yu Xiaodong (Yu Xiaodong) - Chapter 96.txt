The Nangong family's descendants eventually deciphered the treasure clues left by their ancestors, securing this wealth and expanding the Nangong family's influence. Naturally, they did not forget Huang Family's long-standing protection and gifted them a substantial sum to sustain their lineage.

From then on, the Nangong and Huang families emerged as two distinct lineages. Due to this history, the Huang family has always remained subordinate to the Nangong family for generations. This dynamic persisted because the Nangong family consistently outperformed the Huang family, maintaining their status quo.

However, just now, Su Nantian overheard Nangong Yuyan stating that she no longer trusted the Huang family. This suggested that the Huang family had been secretly attempting to break free from their subordinate status. After all, as long as the Huang family remained dependent on the Nangong family, they had to surrender two-thirds of their annual profits to them.

It seemed the Huang family was clearly discontent, hence their desire to sever ties with the Nangong family. Moreover, with no more dynasties or imperial families existing, their positions were now equal. No one wished to spend their entire life under another's command.

As Su Nantian pondered this, Nangong Ping asked Nangong Yuyan: "You just finished your meeting. Who came to see you?"

" Wu Chuan," Nangong Yuyan replied simply, offering no further details.

Nangong Ping visibly tensed upon hearing the name and remarked, "That's strange. Wu Chuan shouldn't have been eligible for candidacy, right? Although he currently holds significant power within the Wu family, he's merely an adopted son of the late patriarch. Back then, he seized control due to a lack of talent in the main branch. How could he now qualify for the succession? If Wu Chuan is eligible, we shouldn't have to debate—just choose him."

Su Nantian listened, noting that Nangong Ping clearly held Wu Chuan in high regard, almost as if his presence alone would resolve the matter.

Nangong Yuyan shook her head and replied, "As Wu Chuan's adopted son, even with immense power, he lacks eligibility. Moreover, back then, the main branch's son fled, prompting Wu Chuan's adoption. He was merely a placeholder."

"Then why did he come to see you? Did he want us Nangong family to help him overturn the Wu family?" Nangong Ping pressed further.

"No, he found the main branch's heir—the son who had fled years ago. Logically, this should be the most legitimate successor. Yet you must remember that other factions within the Wu family would oppose this. Hence, four candidates now vie for succession. Wu Chuan currently supports this returned heir, named Wu Tao, and his daughter Wu You'er. If necessary, he might even back Wu You'er—after all, a young girl would be easier to manipulate."

After Nangong Yuyan's words, Su Nantian remained outwardly calm but internally felt like boiling water. At last, he had learned about Wu You'er and Wu Tao's whereabouts.

Moreover, Su Nantian now knew who had taken Wu Tao and Wu You'er—Wu Chuan.

"Oh, so that's how it is. Wu Chuan has essentially found a puppet for himself. As an adopted son, he lacks legitimacy but now holds power. He just needs a legitimate figure to legitimize his control—like holding a sovereign hostage to command the vassals. If he secures this main branch heir, he effectively claims the Wu family." Nangong Ping's realization was swift.

"Exactly," Nangong Yuyan affirmed. "Thus, Wu Chuan is a valuable ally. Since we have no long-term cooperation or enmity with the Wu family, I believe supporting Wu Chuan this time is acceptable."

Nangong Ping did not immediately respond. He knew Nangong Yuyan had come to consult him, as the Nangong family held only one vote. Their agreement was essential for casting it.

"I think you should first tell me what conditions Wu Chuan proposed," Nangong Ping said, unexpectedly astute. "Don't let him pull the same tricks as Wu Ruotian with vague promises. Otherwise, we'd be doing others' bidding without benefit."

"Fine," Nangong Yuyan replied. "Wu Chuan said if we vote for him this time, he'd give us a third of the port's cargo and no commission."

Nangong Ping's eyes widened. This was indeed a bold offer.

Chapter 470: Puppet

Just as Su Nantian was thrilled to have found Wu You'er and Wu Tao's whereabouts, his mood was instantly shaken by Wu Chuan's proposal.

Not only were Nangong Ping and Yuyan astonished, but even Su Nantian, standing by, felt disbelief.

Previously, through Song Lichen's information, Su Nantian had learned the Wu family's major business in the capital revolved around its inland port.

Though the capital had no coastline, it boasted a historic canal connecting to national trade routes. Even now, this canal remained the city's primary commercial port, having been expanded multiple times without losing its significance.

Thus, the Wu family's control over this port was highly lucrative. Wu Chuan's offer of a third share without commission was indeed tempting for the Nangong family.

"But don't you think this condition is also a bold move? It feels unreasonable, as if something's off. If we truly help Wu Chuan and he betrays us later, it'll always be us who lose out." Nangong Ping's excitement was tempered by suspicion.

Nangong Yuyan waved her hand, saying, "Wu Chuan said he'd provide us with port access tickets immediately as a gesture of goodwill, giving us a third right away."

Nangong Ping was stunned again. "That's truly bold. But if he gives us a third, what oil does he have left?"

"Not necessarily," Nangong Yuyan explained. "Securing our support equals gaining two families' backing. As long as Wu Chuan's rivals can't gather the Wang and Song families' support, even if they do, it would be a tie. Wu Chuan only needs to win one more family's support—no need to promise all his benefits."

Clearly, Nangong Yuyan saw deeper than Nangong Ping. Her analysis of Wu Chuan's leverage and the situation was concise yet insightful.

However, this wasn't Su Nantian's concern. He only needed to focus on Wu Chuan, as he controlled Wu You'er and Wu Tao. If the Nangong family allied with Wu Chuan, it would be beneficial for Su Nantian.

This way, he'd have the advantage to approach Wu You'er and Wu Tao without difficulty, gaining more opportunities to rescue them. Moreover, he now understood Wu Chuan's true motive: using Wu Tao and Wu You'er's legitimate main branch status to secure the succession.

In short, Wu Chuan aimed to control a puppet for himself. As an adopted son, he lacked succession rights, and even with power now, his claim was illegitimate.

Additionally, other eligible Wu family heirs likely refused to cooperate with Wu Chuan. They wanted to become the sole heir, and even if Wu Chuan held power, they'd demand their share. Thus, the benefits from cooperating with Wu Chuan would pale in comparison to those of aligning with these heirs.

As Su Nantian mused, Nangong Ping and Yuyan continued discussing.

"I think the Wu family's internal strife is now irreconcilable. Otherwise, Wu Chuan wouldn't have traveled far to find the heir who fled years ago. This must mean no one in the Wu family supports him. Thus, if we seize this chance, we can ensure Wu Chuan's cooperation and prevent betrayal," Nangong Yuyan's thoughts aligned with Su Nantian, both having seen through Wu Chuan's intent.

"I think we should meet Wu Chuan's subordinates," Nangong Ping suddenly said. "After all, these three are their lifeline."

Su Nantian was startled. Indeed, Nangong Ping's suggestion was correct and touched on something Su Nantian hadn't considered: Wu You'er and Wu Tao were crucial to Wu Chuan. As long as the succession selection hadn't concluded, these three would remain safe.

But if Wu Chuan failed in the succession selection, their safety would be uncertain.

"Your meaning is we hold a leverage over Wu Chuan?" Nangong Yuyan, unusually interested in Nangong Ping's idea, agreed it was a good plan.

"We don't need to do anything to Wu Chuan. Just hold a leverage. If he truly promises, we'll do nothing. But if he betrays us, we can execute a plan through these Wu family members. With the Nangong family's support and a legitimate heir, we can wrest significant power from the Wu family."

Nangong Ping spoke while smiling, as if envisioning a bright future. After speaking, he turned to Su Nantian: "Nantian, prepare yourself. Go out today to investigate."

Before Su Nantian could respond, Nangong Yuyan waved her hand and said, "Not yet. He's new to the Nangong family and doesn't understand much. Also, our actions are limited now; going out would only invite gossip. Even if we go to investigate, it's not the right time. Besides, we're still unfamiliar with the Wu family's internal environment. I've already sent someone to investigate their internal map. Once we get it, we'll proceed."

Su Nantian listened, realizing the Nangong family indeed relied more on this lady. If his judgment was correct, if the Nangong family ever competed for succession like the Wu family, this Yuyan would have a higher chance of winning.

But these matters were irrelevant to Su Nantian. He was eager to obtain the map Yuyan mentioned, to find Wu You'er and Wu Tao.

Chapter 471: Greenhorn

The first night at the Wu family passed without incident for Su Nantian. He didn't impulsively seek Wu You'er and Wu Tao that night. With the Nangong family's support, he could afford to wait. He'd use the internal map of the Wu family once obtained to locate them.

The next morning, Su Nantian arrived at Nangong Ping's room and heard a knock. He opened the door to find Wu family members.

"Respected guests of the Nangong family, our temporary steward invites everyone to breakfast. We'll also introduce the Wu family's four heirs. Breakfast is at 8:30 AM in the first-floor banquet hall. Please arrive punctually." The Wu family servant handed Su Nantian an invitation, appearing extremely formal.

Su Nantian accepted the invitation and nodded, "Understood. We'll be there on time."

After Su Nantian said this, the Wu family servant left immediately. Su Nantian didn't close the door but stood in the corridor, noticing the servant knocked on Nangong Yuyan's room. He then closed the door and returned.

"Nantian, what happened? I heard someone knock," Nangong Ping emerged from the bathroom, drying his hair.

Su Nantian handed him the invitation and said, "The Wu family servant delivered this. We're to go to the first-floor banquet hall at 8:30 AM for breakfast and meet the Wu family's heir candidates."

Nangong Ping took the invitation and said, "This Wu family is interesting. They played tricks with everyone yesterday, leaving them like monkeys. Yet after a night of maneuvering, they now start introducing the invitees. It's amusing. I think the Wu family has forgotten basic etiquette since the patriarch passed."

Clearly, the Wu family's actions had upset other families. But this wasn't Su Nantian's concern. Today, introducing the heir candidates meant he'd surely see Wu Tao and Wu You'er.

Soon after Nangong Ping finished preparing, the group went to the first-floor banquet hall with their invitations. When Nangong Ping and Yuyan arrived, other family representatives were already there. Nangong Ping was the last to arrive but wasn't impolite since time hadn't started.

Seeing Nangong Ping and Yuyan together, the Huang family members greeted them warmly in front of everyone, openly displaying their relationship. After all, the Huang family's dependence on the Nangong family was well-known, so they had no qualms.

Su Nantian stood behind Nangong Ping and surveyed the crowd. He hadn't properly observed these five families yesterday due to haste and the Wu family's chaos.

The Huang family was obvious, but Su Nantian already knew them. The Wang family's young master had previously stood out and left an impression on Su Nantian, though he didn't know his name.

The remaining family was the Song family. Though Su Nantian had some connection with them and worked in the Dragon Group with Song Lichen, he was unfamiliar with the current Song family's power holder.

The Song family was unique among the five families, having completed their succession selection years ago peacefully without such tension. Thus, they hadn't adopted this current form.

Today's representative from the Song family wasn't their patriarch but his son. Though he had brothers, only he came, as they hadn't started competing for succession yet. Hence, no need to start scheming early.

Thus, the Song family's representative appeared younger, perhaps in his early twenties. If considering generations, he should be referred to as Song Lichen's uncle. However, Song Lichen didn't hesitate and provided Su Nantian with the details of this year's Song family representatives. Thus, Su Nantian knew this young man was named Song Yuanyang.

After surveying everyone, Su Nantian finally saw the Wu family's representatives emerge. The one leading was likely Wu Chuan, who controlled real power in the Wu family.

"Everyone, please forgive us for the inconvenience. Since the patriarch's sudden passing, our family has been in chaos, so we've neglected your hospitality. Please forgive us." Wu Chuan said, bowing to the crowd with a humble demeanor—completely unlike what Nangong Ping and Yuyan had described.

But Su Nantian knew not to judge by appearances. One couldn't discern anything from the surface; this was common in such families.

If anyone were truly consistent, they'd be the first to die in this treacherous environment.

"Your Wu family's response is really slow. Last night, we came and were left in the cold. Today, you sent an invitation but arrived late. What etiquette do you have?" A voice suddenly criticized.

This voice was familiar to Su Nantian. He followed the sound and saw it was the Wang family's young master from last night.

Su Nantian secretly smiled, thinking this young man was indeed bold. He had thought the boy was inexperienced and arrogant as a Wang family heir, but now he'd gone further. This time, he directly criticized Wu Chuan, the current power holder of the Wu family. Su Nantian was impressed; this was what "greenhorn fearlessly challenges tigers" meant.

Chapter 472: United Front

Clearly, the Wang family's young master's outburst left Wu Chuan embarrassed. He could only awkwardly smile at the crowd, but the young master remained defiant, ignoring everyone's awkwardness and sitting proudly.

Su Nantian watched this scene and found it amusing. Before introducing the Wu family's heir candidates, there was already an incident, and this situation seemed difficult to resolve.

After all, this was the Wang family's young master, and everyone knew he was the next heir. No one wanted to offend him.

Moreover, these people's own heir positions weren't decided yet; they'd need the Wang family's votes. Thus, offending this young master now would be unwise. And this boy seemed vengeful; he might retaliate later, making it hard to face him.

So no one spoke up, and Wu Chuan could only stand on stage awkwardly. But he couldn't truly apologize to everyone; if he did, his dignity and the Wu family's would be lost.

As everyone sat silently, the Wang family's young master's attendant finally couldn't bear it. Though he was just a servant, his lord had instructed him beforehand to intervene if the young master caused trouble.

Now, this situation was unacceptable; it made everyone in the hall awkward. Thus, he could now intervene.

The attendant approached and whispered to the young master.

Su Nantian was curious how this attendant would persuade the young master, so he expanded his senses to eavesdrop.

The attendant said, "Master, we should retreat a step. The Wu family's lack of etiquette is their fault, not ours. Moreover, this scene isn't good; if your father learns about it, he'll understand it's not your fault. But it might still trouble him, and if he forbids you from playing video games, that's bad."

Su Nantian raised his eyebrows. This approach was different from what he expected. He hadn't thought the attendant would use video games as an excuse, but it was amusing.

However, Su Nantian knew he had to suppress his laughter now; otherwise, it would cause trouble for himself.

After hearing this, the Wang family's young master looked shocked and seemed genuinely frightened by what the attendant said. He cleared his throat and said to Wu Chuan on stage, "Alright, I'll overlook this. The Wu family's lack of etiquette is their problem, not ours. Hope you improve it. Alright."

Su Nantian hadn't expected the young master to repeat what the attendant said, which made him want to laugh even more.

Though this statement embarrassed Wu Chuan further, it at least resolved the issue. Thus, Wu Chuan could continue his previous speech to introduce the Wu family's four heir candidates.

Wu Chuan smiled awkwardly and said, "Ahem, let's proceed. Our Wu family has four heir candidates today. They'll now appear one by one to meet everyone. Who will become the next heir is up to your help."

Although these families had voting rights, it didn't mean they could directly choose another family's heir. Their votes were a portion of the total, not decisive, but their numbers were crucial, hence why these candidates cared so much.

At this moment, Nangong Ping whispered to Yuyan beside him: "Wu Chuan's supported candidate is definitely the strongest. He'll surely secure internal Wu family support. The key is our external votes. If someone gets all the votes, they could oppose Wu Chuan. Perhaps this family might be infiltrated by external forces."

This possibility was minimal, as other families couldn't unite. Other candidates had benefits for their respective families, so they wouldn't align with others.

Except the Huang family, which followed the Nangong family.

"Wu Chuan just wants to install a puppet. But his conditions are indeed good. I wonder if the other three candidates have approached us yet. If better conditions arise, switching sides is possible," Yuyan whispered.

Indeed, Nangong Ping and Yuyan were pragmatic. Though they were rivals in the Nangong family's succession, their external goals aligned. They wouldn't weaken the Nangong family's strength. Seeing this, Su Nantian understood why the Nangong family had rapidly risen after a period of decline.

It was because the Nangong family's people could discern matters clearly. They were unified externally, regardless of internal issues. When external conflicts arose, they stood united.

This time was no exception. Though different candidates had approached them, Nangong Ping and Yuyan remained united. Ultimately, they came here to seek benefits for the Nangong family. Who would become the Wu heir was secondary.

Chapter 473: Introducing Candidates

After the Wang family's young master incident, the Wu family's breakfast meeting could finally proceed.

Wu Chuan said, "Now let our four Wu family heir candidates appear one by one to greet everyone. You might meet one of them again in the future."

As he spoke, a man approached. He looked around thirty-five and said to everyone below: "Hello, I'm Wu Yu. One of the four Wu family heir candidates. Our main branch is weak, so we collateral branches must stand up for the Wu family's future. Please remember my name; we might meet again."

At this moment, someone beside Yuyan whispered: "Miss, Wu Yu is a collateral branch member. He's currently the strongest among them. Many support him, and the recent hotel success is his doing. He has both connections and financial backing. Except Wu Chuan, who doesn't want him to compete for the succession, he's the most capable and likely candidate among the four."

Su Nantian looked over curiously. This was Yuyan's assistant, who had thoroughly researched the Wu family and now informed her of their situation.

Compared to this, Nangong Ping's assistant was somewhat useless. He looked embarrassed but couldn't speak, as he hadn't investigated the Wu family beforehand.

Nangong Ping looked at his assistant with disappointment, contrasting sharply with Yuyan's team. However, Yuyan didn't hide the information; she shared it openly with Nangong Ping. Otherwise, her assistant wouldn't have spoken so loudly.

But this wasn't Su Nantian's concern; he was just a bodyguard, and such matters weren't within his duties.

"If this person can't offer enticing conditions, I think he won't have much chance," Yuyan suddenly said to Nangong Ping.

"Why? He's capable, and many support him in the Wu family. If he secures a couple of votes, it should be fine," Nangong Ping was puzzled by Yuyan's statement.

But Su Nantian understood what Yuyan meant.

From the Nangong family's perspective, Wu Chuan would definitely oppose Wu Yu. Moreover, Wu Yu's abilities were evident to other families. If the Wu family entrusted him with succession, it would threaten others.

Thus, as Yuyan said, unless Wu Yu offered truly compelling conditions to win the votes of these five families, he wouldn't have an advantage.

Internally blocked by Wu Chuan and externally with other families' calculations, Wu Yu would not last long.

"Did you find out who Wu Yu approached yesterday?" Yuyan suddenly asked, indicating she had indeed investigated.

Her assistant nodded and said, "If our information is correct, Wu Yu approached the Song family."

At this point, Su Nantian's gaze shifted to the Song family. The current Song heir, Song Yuanyang, sat in his seat with a composed expression, showing no reaction to Wu Yu's appearance.

No one could discern his inner thoughts or whether he and Wu Yu planned to cooperate or had a falling out. All that was clear was Song Yuanyang's emotionless face, revealing nothing.

"This Wu Yu is indeed sharp. Among the families present, the Song family's heir has already taken over. The Wang family's young master is a single child but clearly unreliable. The Huang family follows us, and we haven't taken a stance yet. They must know that winning the Nangong family's support is most difficult, so they chose the safest option—Song family. His strategy is clear," Nangong Ping remarked, impressed despite the situation.

But unfortunately, Wu Yu's chances of survival were slim.

After Wu Yu spoke, he stepped aside, and Wu Chuan continued: "This is one of our four heir candidates. Now let's welcome the second candidate."

As Wu Chuan spoke, a familiar figure approached—Wu Ruotian, who had visited Nangong Ping the night before.

Compared to Wu Yu, Wu Ruotian's presence was significantly weaker. He stood timidly and after a while smiled awkwardly, saying, "Hello, I'm Wu Ruotian, one of the four Wu family heir candidates. I hope to be entrusted with the Wu family's responsibilities."

That was all he said. Compared to Wu Yu, their differences were evident.

"Last night when this person approached me, he was similar to now—able to speak a few words. But now he's like this. I don't know who put him forward. Has the Wu family no one left?" Nangong Ping said, clearly unimpressed by Wu Ruotian. He truly looked down on him, and this person's performance was so weak it made others look foolish. In a group of eagles, he appeared as a chicken, destined to be eaten by others. Wu Ruotian's chances of becoming the heir were slim.

Not only Nangong Ping, but others in the hall also clearly didn't support Wu Ruotian. They shook their heads repeatedly.

Chapter 474: Wu Chuan's Attitude

While everyone dismissed Wu Ruotian, Nangong Yuyan suddenly asked her assistant: "Did you find out about Wu Ruotian?"

The assistant nodded and said, "Wu Ruotian is closer to the Wu family's main branch than Wu Chuan. However, their branch has never fared well in the Wu family. They were assigned unremarkable industries initially. But Wu Ruotian's father managed well, so their branch lived comfortably. As for how Wu Ruotian secured the heir candidate position, according to my investigation, it might be because of Wu Chuan..."

At this point, the assistant lowered his voice and whispered between Nangong Ping and Yuyan. Clearly, this information was confidential; otherwise, the assistant wouldn't have acted so discreetly.

This revelation surprised both Nangong Ping and Yuyan. Why would Wu Chuan bring in Wu Ruotian?

But Su Nantian had already understood. He'd wondered how Wu Ruotian managed to infiltrate. He was unremarkable, with no background or ability to solicit support from the five families. The five families weren't fools; after hearing Wu Ruotian's promises, they'd react like Nangong Ping—further doubting his resources and seeing him as someone who could only promise the Wu family's future.

But now Su Nantian understood: Wu Ruotian was essentially a puppet of Wu Chuan. He wouldn't let Wu Ruotian become the next heir, as his branch had some resources. Thus, Wu Chuan would only offer him partial benefits to secure a candidate position.

Then, Wu Chuan could elevate his controlled Wu You'er to the heir position. This way, no one in the Wu family could challenge Wu Chuan's power. Thus, Wu Chuan brought in Wu Ruotian to reduce risk. And with Wu Ruotian's current performance, no one would support him.

After Wu Ruotian, the third Wu family heir candidate appeared. Though not as strong as Wu Yu, he was better than Wu Ruotian. After an introduction, Su Nantian remembered his name—Wu Feng.

It wasn't that Su Nantian wanted to remember these names, but he needed to understand the Wu family's power structure and identify who could be useful or cooperative.

Song Lichen's previous report had incomplete details about these Wu family members, and at that time, no one knew who the heir candidates were. Thus, this was Su Nantian's true opportunity to learn about the Wu family. He had to use his limited time now to grasp everything, making this assistant's information crucial.

Indeed, among the three Wu family heir candidates currently on stage, Wu Yu was stronger, Wu Feng next, and Wu Ruotian was too weak. No one would support such a person.

Su Nantian felt oddly tense, as the final Wu family heir candidate was about to appear. If he hadn't misheard, it should be Wu You'er. Though Wu Tao had been taken to the Wu family first and was indeed the main branch's son, he hadn't returned for years. Now in his forties, if he became the patriarch, it would be hard to control.
