Lin Suyun pointed her finger at Su Nantian's nose and scolded him, a flush of red appearing on her face.
She had always liked him, but she hadn't expected to say it so directly—his heart wasn’t ready yet...
Her words had slipped out instinctively, and by the time she realized it, it was too late.
Su Nantian stared at Lin Suyun in bewilderment.
He hadn’t planned to do anything yet—just wanted to feel it a little more, but his tiny thought had been discovered.
Could Lin Suyun be an undercover cultivator who could read minds?
Impossible!
No one could hide as deeply as he did. He was certain of it.
They stared at each other, both caught in a strange embarrassment.
Su Nantian followed Lin Suyun’s gaze and blushed instantly.
Cursed old driver!
That box of cursed condoms the old driver had given him must have slipped out of his pocket at some point.
Chapter Thirty-Seven: Twelve Times in One Night?
This awkward situation was Su Nantian’s first time encountering.
In the celestial realm for twenty thousand years, he had focused solely on cultivation, with no distractions. His knowledge of romantic matters was practically nonexistent.
He was still a virgin...
A two-thousand-year-old virgin.
It was sad to think about.
Seeing the condoms slipping out of his pocket, Su Nantian didn’t know what to say.
He looked at the condoms and then at Lin Suyun, feeling her face grow redder by the second and his heart race faster.
Just as he was about to speak, there came a *snap!*
The already crushed condom packaging had finally burst open.
The inferior package seemed to mock them.
It revealed the condoms inside, all eager and ready.
There were twelve of them!
Twelve!
Lin Suyun’s already red face turned crimson, as if she had become a ripe apple.
Twelve condoms completely shattered her image of Su Nantian.
Was he planning to do it twelve times in one night? Lin Suyun couldn’t even imagine.
“You dirty bastard!” Lin Suyun grabbed a pillow nearby and hurled it at Su Nantian.
“Suyun, it’s not what you think—this is…”
Su Nantian hurriedly explained, but by the end, he didn’t know how to finish.
*Ping ping!*
“Someone’s ringing the doorbell; I’ll go open it.”
Su Nantian felt like he had heard a savior’s voice and rushed to the door.
It was none other than the manager from before. He quickly whispered a few words in his ear.
The manager nodded, clearly understanding.
“Sir, this is our general manager, Manager Cao.”
Mo Yu introduced the well-dressed man beside him.
“Sir, I’m truly sorry for what happened earlier.”
Cao Xu bowed in apology. When he heard about the golden card, he had rushed back as fast as possible, but hadn’t expected this person to be so young.
“What exactly happened earlier?”
Lin Suyun, seeing Su Nantian hadn’t returned yet, walked to the door with a lingering blush and asked.
Su Nantian immediately gave Mo Yu a meaningful glance.
“This lady, I’m truly sorry. Since you were our last guests today, we gifted you a small item, but it turned out to be defective. We’ve come to replace it for you.”
Mo Yu thought quickly and said.
“See, now you know why I bought that thing—it was Mo Manager who forced it on me. No need to replace it.”
Su Nantian smiled and explained.
“Well, I forgive you then.”
Lin Suyun glanced at it and understood immediately—it was clearly a setup.
Manager Cao had been stunned the moment he saw Lin Suyun. His eyes held admiration.
The daughter of the Lin family with a mysterious golden card young man.
He had known about Lin Suyun only by chance, when he had accompanied the chairman to a gathering and had seen her from afar.
He remembered it clearly because Lin Suyun’s figure, like a lotus blooming from water, had been etched into his mind.
But he knew it was impossible—his status and hers were too far apart.
Although he had reached the position of general manager at a young age, it was still not enough.
He had never imagined he would see Lin Suyun again.
So his heart was now filled with excitement.
“Miss Lin, it’s an honor to meet you here.”
Mo Yu widened his eyes.
The daughter of the Lin family!
Su Nantian’s heart skipped a beat—had he recognized her?
“Oh, that’s great. I actually have a question to ask you.”
Lin Suyun playfully looked at Su Nantian.
“Enough, let’s talk about it tomorrow. You’ve apologized and met the person, so leave now.”
Su Nantian saw the situation was getting too tense and spoke quickly, then shut the door.
“What’s wrong? You’re being guilty?”
Seeing Su Nantian’s reaction, Lin Suyun was satisfied.
“This is complicated—it’s not what you think. It’ll take too long to explain, so let’s just sleep.”
Su Nantian said calmly.
“Sleep? You’ll sleep outside tonight.”
Lin Suyun said, then turned and walked into the room.
*Bang!*
The door slammed shut.
Her face grew hot again.
When she heard the word “sleep,” she thought of those twelve condoms.
Men were all no good, but even though she said that, her heart felt sweet.
Outside, Manager Cao had just seen his dream lover and was now blocked out.
It felt like a hallucination, but the door reminded him that his longing was futile.
Su Nantian looked at the door and shook his head in无奈.
He walked to the rooftop, sat cross-legged, and began his night’s cultivation.
After absorbing the previous cultivator’s spiritual energy, his realm had only slightly improved.
Absorbing the spiritual energy of the third level of refining qi had barely reached the second level.
A slight improvement in one level.
It was no wonder—due to differences in cultivation methods, the density of spiritual energy within each person varied greatly. Its power was therefore incomparably different, which was why high-level cultivation methods were so fiercely contested.
Moreover, absorbing others’ spiritual energy had impurities and a certain amount of hostility. Accumulating too much would affect the stability of one’s Dao heart, becoming an obstacle to breaking through.
It seemed this kind of thing should be done less in the future.
Although the spiritual energy was scarce each night, even a mosquito’s worth was still meat.
The next morning, soft sunlight filtered through the floor-to-ceiling window and illuminated Lin Suyun’s pale face.
Her long lashes fluttered, and her eyes opened slightly.
“Ah!”
“How did you end up here? How long have you been watching me?”
Lin Suyun thought about her messy hair and unmade face, then quickly covered herself with the blanket.
“Get up, sleepyhead. I just arrived. Let’s have breakfast.”
Su Nantian smiled happily, watching Lin Suyun’s flustered state.
He said that and closed the door before leaving.
One person had intended to cover themselves and sleep a little longer, but upon hearing about breakfast, she immediately got up.
She remembered Su Nantian’s previous cooking and drooled instantly.
She quickly tidied herself up, faster than usual by a huge margin.
She opened the door and looked at the table.
It was empty!
“Where’s the breakfast?”
Lin Suyun asked playfully.
“You came out so quickly, girls usually take a long time to get up.”
Su Nantian was surprised by Lin Suyun’s speed, which exceeded his expectations.
He had just ordered breakfast and it hadn’t arrived yet.
“Did you order it?”
Lin Suyun said disappointedly, suddenly remembering this was a hotel, not her own home.
“Is that why you were so quick? There are no ingredients here, how could we cook?”
Su Nantian sighed helplessly.
*Knock knock.*
“Sir, good morning, Miss Lin.”
Manager Cao personally pushed the food cart in.
Chapter Thirty-Eight: The Pastries Were Poisoned
“There are so many, and they look good. Oh, they’re all my favorites.” Lin Suyun said in surprise.
“I specially prepared this breakfast for Miss Lin,” Manager Cao smiled, and hearing Miss Lin’s praise gave him immense courage.
He took a few steps closer to Lin Suyun unconsciously.
“I specially hired a pastry chef, who prepared these based on your preferences,” Manager Cao added, waiting silently for Lin Suyun’s next compliment.
“Specially!”
“Based on your preferences!”
Upon hearing these words, Su Nantian frowned and calmly watched Manager Cao.
You little brat, you’re getting too full of yourself!
Lin Suyun took a delicately crafted pastry and slowly placed it into her cherry-red lips.
“Wait.” Su Nantian suddenly spoke.
“What’s wrong?” Lin Suyun’s hand froze mid-air, watching Su Nantian’s rare expression. Did he get jealous?
Su Nantian took the pastry from Lin Suyun’s hand and placed it into his mouth in front of Manager Cao and Lin Suyun’s surprised gazes.
It was poisoned!
So powerful a poison—how had it slipped past my eyes?
He immediately spat out the pastry.
“Sir, what’s wrong?”
Manager Cao looked at Su Nantian’s deep gaze and his previous actions.
Had he offended this gentleman?
Miss Lin!
It seemed he had become overconfident.
“Sir, I’m truly sorry it didn’t suit your taste. I’ll go replace it immediately.” Manager Cao quickly bowed and apologized, fearing even a second’s delay would cost him his life.
“Nantian, I knew you wouldn’t like this kind of thing. Alright, go down.”
She was even more certain Su Nantian had gotten jealous, and her heart felt sweet.
“Yes.”
“Wait—let me ask Manager Cao to try this pastry too,” Su Nantian said coldly, with a hint of killing intent.
Lin Suyun realized something was wrong.
Manager Cao trembled and extended his hand to take a piece. He had already tasted it before coming, and the flavor was excellent.
It seemed his previous actions had angered this gentleman, as he had only heard of the golden card from the chairman—people of miraculous and noble status, closely related to the Lin family.
Now he was extremely nervous.
His hands shook more and more.
*Smack!*
The pastry fell directly to the ground.
Manager Cao felt his vision go black and collapsed onto the floor.
“What’s wrong with him?” Lin Suyun asked.
“Nothing, he just poisoned.” Su Nantian said calmly.
“Poisoned? But he didn’t even eat it yet.” Lin Suyun was confused.
“He had already eaten before coming here. Someone wants to kill you.”
“Ah, what should we do?” Lin Suyun felt scared—so much had happened in these two days.
“Don’t worry, I’m here to protect you. As long as you stay with me, no one can succeed.” Su Nantian said.
“Ah, being with you… then okay.” Lin Suyun blushed upon hearing these words.
“Then save him quickly,” Lin Suyun said, looking at the unconscious Manager Cao.
Upon hearing this, Su Nantian shook his head.
Suyun was still too kind-hearted.
He pulled out a silver needle and inserted it into Manager Cao’s body several times, and the poison was neutralized.
The silver needles were coated with black toxins.
If it weren’t for the fact that Manager Cao had no malicious intent, Su Nantian would never have intervened.
“Alright, the poison has been neutralized. He’ll wake up in a while.”
Su Nantian focused his gaze and protected Lin Suyun behind him, looking up at the rooftop.
*Shu shu shu.*
Three black figures suddenly appeared on the rooftop, as if they had emerged from thin air.
But this didn’t escape Su Nantian’s eyes—just their speed was fast.
“Blue Dragon, look at that kid—he doesn’t even know how to run.”
The man on the right spoke.
“White Tiger, haven’t you noticed? That kid is scared stiff by our aura. Our name, the Blade Three Swordsmen, is well-known in the assassin world.”
The man on the left said.
“Blue Dragon, White Tiger, don’t be careless.”
The man in the middle spoke, and both immediately fell silent. This was their leader, Red.
“Yes, elder brother.” Both spoke in unison.
In a blink, they vanished.
Su Nantian’s lips curled into a mocking smile.
Speed? Their movements were pitifully slow in his eyes, full of flaws.
Looking at Su Nantian’s lack of movement, the two men smiled more broadly.
This move had been practiced for years and reached a seamless level, leaving no escape unless someone could be faster than them.
Unfortunately, so far no one had appeared, and none would in the future.
Their coordination was perfect, moving left and right, up and down, blocking all escape routes.
But in Su Nantian’s eyes, it was too slow. Even perfect coordination was useless.
At a distance of just one meter, both men drew their swords simultaneously.
At that moment, Su Nantian took a step forward.
His fists, accompanied by a gust of wind, like a tiger descending from the mountain, struck directly at their chests.
Blue Dragon and White Tiger felt an overwhelming aura approaching them, tightening their breaths.
That was the pressure of absolute power.
They wanted to draw their swords and stab, but only half had been drawn when the fist wind arrived.
*Boom boom!* Two dull sounds, accompanied by the sound of cracked ribs.
Their bodies flew backward, and their speed was even faster than before, spitting out large amounts of blood that formed a line of blood in the air.
Blinding!
Red!
And just as they had left, they returned—only half-dead. They were coughing up blood profusely, their eyes wide with terror, staring at their elder brother. Their eyes gradually lost their light, but the expression of fear remained permanently on their faces.
Red roared into the sky. Blue Dragon and White Tiger, his brothers who had fought alongside him, were now dead.
The fire of rage instantly filled his mind.
Although this scene had shocked him, the death of his brother made his blood boil.
Even if it wasn’t for this mission, he wouldn’t run away—he would avenge them, even if it meant death.
In an instant, his eyes were filled with bloodshot veins and he glared fiercely at Su Nantian.
Then, from his pocket, he pulled out a bottle of explosive pills.
This was the latest high-tech product from America.
Each one was worth tens of millions, and if it weren’t for the terrifying side effect of exploding upon death, its value would be even higher.
Even so, it was hard to come by.
This was the result of his lifelong savings—bought for this life-or-death moment.
After taking it, his physical functions immediately increased exponentially until his body could no longer bear it and he exploded. And the explosion’s power was proportional to his increased physical strength.
Tests showed it could level a skyscraper.
A life for a life!
Such power was enough to drive people mad.
Without hesitation, Red swallowed it.
Chapter Thirty-Nine: Blood Rain Falling
After eating the explosive pills, Red’s body swelled visibly.
Red felt his body filled with power, as if a dormant dragon had awakened within him, and he could fully control his original strength without any discomfort.
His eyes no longer held fear but instead a belief that even gods would be killed, and even Buddhas would be slain.
Red swelled!
Incredibly so!
At this moment, Red looked terrifying, his face’s flesh almost completely distorted into an unrecognizable form.
His eyes were reduced to slits.
Su Nantian watched the rapidly expanding fat man and felt his spiritual energy rising at an unbelievable speed.
He frowned—just a strong human before, but now he had unleashed spiritual energy exceeding the third level of refining qi within seconds.
No good!
He couldn’t let him continue like this.
Not because Su Nantian feared him, but because he was worried that this man’s explosion would hurt Lin Suyun.
Red roared.
Both men vanished from their original spot and reappeared above the rooftop’s swimming pool.
Four fists collided!
A dull sound!
A ball-shaped figure flew backward and stopped after several meters.
A terrifying gust of energy erupted from the two, lifting all the water in the swimming pool and scattering it everywhere—no drop remained.
“You’re strong, even in this state I’m not your match.”
Red was shocked, his lips bleeding, hands hanging down with blood flowing profusely, an eerie sight.
He had thought he could crush him into meat paste, but instead his arms were shattered—though they looked intact, the bones inside had turned to powder.
Strangely, he felt no pain at all.
Then he felt the bones in his arms healing rapidly, and his strength became even stronger. His round arms were quickly shrinking.
He let out a laugh.
Again, he raised his arms.
Su Nantian was slightly surprised but realized it was just the body’s regeneration ability.
The more this continued, the shorter his time would be.
It would only accelerate its explosion.
Su Nantian said nothing and wanted to get this man far away before he exploded.
In a blink, they clashed again.
Su Nantian controlled his strength carefully, trying not to kick this man away.
If it landed below, that would be bad.
*Boom boom boom!*
Red’s body kept breaking and repairing itself, breaking and repairing—quickly transforming from a meat ball into a red husk with visible bones. His strength kept growing, and his spiritual energy rose.
Red felt his power unprecedentedly strong—capable of shattering a mountain peak—but the more so, the more terrified he became.
Because up to now, he hadn’t injured a single hair of Su Nantian; instead, he had been passively beaten.
His strength was completely suppressed, with no chance to fight back.
He felt he wouldn’t last long.
His eyes turned blood-red, and instead of attacking, he tightly hugged Su Nantian, his madness intensifying.
Su Nantian let out a cold hum and folded Red into a ball, then kicked him fiercely toward the sky.
*Shu!*
A sound of breaking through the air.
Thousands of meters high, Red’s body exploded violently, turning into dust and blood mist mixed with countless fragments falling down.
It landed on the ground, forming a rain of blood.
Red never understood why.
Thousands of meters away, on the rooftop of a high-rise building.
A man in white clothes held a telescope and saw this scene, his pupils shrinking sharply.
His eyes were filled with shock.
This man was none other than Li Yukun.
Yesterday, he had been preparing to follow Li Fei as agreed to deal with the Lin family’s matter. He had only delayed a little on the way, and Li Fei had already gone ahead impatiently.
When he arrived at the Lin family’s place, everything was already settled—Li Fei had failed.
This result completely surprised him. The Lin family apparently had another cultivator.
He didn’t want to draw attention, so he left silently and searched for a long time until he finally found Li Fei unconscious on a remote mountain.
After understanding the real situation, he was shocked.
How could someone not fear his talismans? Even he couldn’t do it.
Why had a cultivator of such strength suddenly appeared in Fengcheng?
Was it someone from the Sun family in Fengcheng?
How could the Lin family be connected to the Sun family?
After investigation, he confirmed it had nothing to do with the Sun family but found no other clues.
To estimate this person’s strength, he had specially brought in one of the top assassins from the secular world.
He knew these three weren’t a match for this person, but he hadn’t expected them to lose so quickly. Even he would have had a hard time dealing with these three.
And this person could even defeat Red, who had taken the explosive pills, without any chance to fight back. He was kicked into the sky like a ball.
This explosive pill had been tested by him personally—its increased power was enough to overwhelm even him, over a thousand catties.
He was certain he wasn’t this person’s match.
Suddenly, his hair stood on end—he had been discovered.
He knew he was careless; the scene had made his aura unstable.
Immediately, he turned and fled with all his strength.
Su Nantian narrowed his eyes, watching the direction Li Yukun had fled, a glint of coldness flashing.
He knew he couldn’t catch up now; if his spiritual awareness hadn’t been restored, he would have no chance of escaping.
Unknown when he had woken up, Manager Cao stared at Su Nantian on the rooftop as if seeing a ghost, his face pale.
He was relieved he hadn’t done anything excessive or said anything inappropriate—now, his feelings for Miss Lin had completely died out.
Not even a trace of ashes remained!
Looking at Su Nantian, who seemed like a god or demon, walking toward him step by step.
He quickly knelt on the ground and bowed, thanking Su Nantian for his life-saving grace and mercy.
“Nantian, are you okay?” Lin Suyun asked with concern.
That scene had truly frightened her. Although she had seen Su Nantian’s strength before, she was still worried and felt heart-pounding.
“Don’t worry; I’m here to protect you.” Su Nantian said, then wrapped his hand around Lin Suyun’s slender waist.
Lin Suyun blushed and didn’t object—her flustered heart immediately calmed down.
*Bang!*
The door of the presidential suite was kicked open by someone.
“Patrol team, raise your hands and don’t move.”
A dozen people rushed into the room, all wearing black uniforms.
The one speaking was a beautiful woman, her black uniform too tight, her chest bulging as if filled with two bombs.
Her face was exquisite, her white hands holding a gun, exuding a fierce and masculine aura.
Chapter Forty: The Legendary Mother Dragon!
“Did you hear me? You two, hugging each other.” The female patrol officer spoke again.
These two hadn’t seen her holding a gun—how dare they hug each other? It was truly despicable.
She had never been ignored like this before.
Lin Suyun suddenly snapped out of it and pushed Su Nantian away, as if she had done something shameful.
Su Nantian reluctantly let go, not having time to fully feel the softness of her hand.
He felt slightly disappointed.
Seeing the female patrol officer, he was instantly captivated—her face wasn’t inferior to Lin Suyun’s beauty.
Her angry expression was also quite adorable.
“What happened with the explosion here?” The female patrol officer said.
“Don’t waste time talking, take them away.”
The man next to the female patrol officer immediately said in a serious tone.
This man disliked Su Nantian for no reason, disliking his eyes that looked at Zhang Xue without restraint.
“Wait, Wu Jun, first ask before taking them.”
Zhang Xue stopped the people moving forward, looking at Wu Jun with dislike.
She had to follow him every time—she couldn’t get rid of him.
Wu Jun said nothing, because Zhang Xue’s identity was different—she was the daughter of the patrol team leader. He couldn’t afford to offend her.
He could only rely on his experience and find a reason to follow Zhang Xue, hoping one day he would win her heart.
“Report: two corpses found.” A man in black uniform said.
“Now you have nothing to say, take them away.”
Wu Jun grabbed Su Nantian’s opportunity.
“I admit it, these two were killed by me.” Su Nantian shrugged and said.
“Ah, you even admit it—killing people and then having the nerve to argue?” Wu Jun immediately approached.
“What’s your name?” Zhang Xue frowned and asked.
“Su Nantian, beauty, what’s your name?” Su Nantian smiled at Zhang Xue.
“You can’t take him away, he’s from the Lin family.”
Seeing Wu Jun approach, Lin Suyun quickly said, glancing at Su Nantian. “At this point, you still want to flirt.”
“You’re crazy, he said his surname was Su—how could he be from the Lin family? If you say more, they’ll take you away too.”
Wu Jun grabbed Su Nantian. He wouldn’t really take the Lin family’s daughter away, just to scare him.
“Don’t worry; there won’t be any problems. If you eliminate evil and promote good, maybe they’ll even give me a commendation.” Su Nantian smiled at Lin Suyun and didn’t resist, allowing Wu Jun to grab him.
“My grandfather will save you.” Lin Suyun said.
“Isolate the scene, take this one away too,” Zhang Xue looked at the trembling Manager Cao on the ground and then at Su Nantian who remained calm, sneering.
Su Nantian couldn’t help but want to tease Zhang Xue.
In the celestial realm, how could there be such a uniform temptation? The beauties in the celestial realm were all ethereal, but this woman was down-to-earth.
Maybe it was because of Lin Suyun that his quiet virgin heart had stirred.
“Beauty, you haven’t told me your name yet.”
Su Nantian stared at the two bombs rising and falling on Zhang Xue’s chest, smiling.
“Later I’ll tell you, get in.” Zhang Xue said.
Her breath was already hurried, and she grabbed a stick to hit him—thinking about those lewd eyes made it too easy for him.
She took a deep breath to calm herself, then slowly put down the stick.
“Kid, you’ll have it coming.” Wu Jun said with a dark gaze; he wanted to teach this kid a lesson, maybe Zhang Xue would give herself to him. Thinking about the scene of waves and tides, his heart was hot.
Su Nantian smiled, if the beauty had a whip instead of a stick it would be perfect—why was it a stick?
He had sticks! And they were very useful!
Su Nantian shook his head, it was a pity.
……
In the interrogation room, a small dark cell.
Su Nantian sat on a chair with only a light hanging overhead.
“Xue’er, we’re alone in this room—what if your colleagues see it?” Su Nantian looked at Zhang Xue, even sitting in the dark, her pale face couldn’t be hidden.
“I’ll tell you, if you don’t tell the truth today, you’ll suffer.” Zhang Xue heard this lecherous man talking nonsense and was angry. She regretted telling him her name.
“Xue’er, since you want to know the truth, come closer and I’ll tell you.” Su Nantian looked at Zhang Xue who was angry.
“What else are you planning?” Zhang Xue moved closer.
“Come a little closer, come even closer.”
Gradually, Su Nantian’s lips were only twenty centimeters from Zhang Xue’s ear.
“Speak.” Zhang Xue didn’t worry about Su Nantian planning anything, because his body was tied to the chair and he couldn’t move.
“You’ve left your buttons undone!”
Su Nantian whispered in her ear.
Zhang Xue looked down and saw that even the buttons on her inner shirt were undone, revealing a black bra.
Her face turned crimson instantly, almost bleeding, and she quickly turned around to push the two white rabbits in front of her back.
Su Nantian hadn’t expected it to be so revealing—deep and bottomless, like a deep abyss.
Especially the black layer covering it, barely visible but evoking imagination.
“Xue’er, I’ve always said your clothes are too tight—too restrictive for growth.” Su Nantian smiled.
“You…” Zhang Xue was about to say something, but the door opened.
“Zhang Xue, the manager has been scared into madness and is talking nonsense.” Wu Jun walked in and said loudly.
“You first ask, I’ll go out for a while.”
Zhang Xue said and turned to leave the room, her face red as she rushed to the surveillance room.
Her heart had already whipped Su Nantian a thousand times.
“Both of you go out, and by the way, if you dare to talk about what you saw.”
Zhang Xue made a gesture, making the two below feel cold.
Zhang Xue accessed the video and quickly deleted the indecent scenes, her face flushed with red, eyes full of anger.
Like a dragon about to explode—only this one was female!
Legendary Mother Dragon!
“Don’t talk nonsense, how could these two be your victims? They are top assassins in the country. Do you know how many people have failed against them?” Wu Jun said.
Su Nantian’s arrogance made him extremely annoyed, talking nonsense.
“Ha!”
“What are you laughing at?”
“Don’t you know that there are people beyond us, and never underestimate anyone? The world is vast. What you see isn’t necessarily what it is.” Su Nantian smiled.
“Even if you are from beyond, hmpf, a poor dropout who just graduated and has worked for two years—how could you have such skills? I can’t help but doubt your identity.” Wu Jun said with clenched teeth. “It seems the water prison here is welcoming you.”
Chapter Forty-One: This Is Impossible!
“Where did the leader of the Three Swordsmen go?” Wu Jun said solemnly.
“He was the worst, originally wanted to leave a complete body—hmm, he was beaten into blood water.” Su Nantian shook his head.
Blood water!
Could the red rain on the ground be Red?
How could it be, was he in cahoots with the manager?
Who else killed him?
Wu Jun’s mind flashed with thoughts he couldn’t believe.
He didn’t want to believe it was this person.
How could this person be Red’s match? He was Red, who had once killed a high-level warrior named Luo Hua and escaped successfully, becoming famous in the secular assassin world.
He had remained at large until now.
“How can you prove this is true?” Wu Jun couldn’t imagine, if it was true, how terrifying this young man would be. His heart couldn’t calm down.
“I am the best proof.” Su Nantian said calmly.
“You, hah! It’s laughable. If you can’t even beat me, how could you kill Red?”
Wu Jun mocked with a smile and took out something from his pocket, slowly leaning over the table.
Su Nantian smiled and did the same.
“I’ll tell you, Zhang Xue’s idea isn’t something you can beat…”
Wu Jun’s body stiffened, his body no longer under his control.
His face’s smile hadn’t even had time to bloom before it disappeared.
His eyes were bulging, like goldfish eyes.
His mouth was wide open, enough to fit a fist.
“What do you think of the electric shock? It’s nice, isn’t it? This voltage is enough to make me itch.” Su Nantian teased.
Lightning was a daily occurrence for him.
“What…?”
Wu Jun hadn’t expected Su Nantian to be unbound and had escaped.
And the electric shock had no effect, instead he was shocked himself—this was over three million volts.
Wu Jun’s thoughts were short-circuited.
He was shocked to the point of doubting his life and the world.
After a groan, he collapsed on the table.
When Zhang Xue saw this scene after processing the video, she immediately called for others.
A moment later.
