The door to the interrogation room swung open, and several figures were shoved inside, surrounding Su Nantian tightly.

Wu Jun was dragged out, but Su Nantian remained motionless.

Yet no one approached; they merely encircled him, bewildered by the situation.

…

Feng Yue, the head of the patrol squad, hung up his phone, his forehead drenched in sweat, his heart pounding wildly.

Ring! Ring!

Feng Yue seized the phone without hesitation, as if delaying a second would cost him his life. “I’ve uncovered the truth; release them immediately.”

“Feng, I haven’t even spoken yet—just let them go,” a deep voice replied.

“Ah, Elder Chen.” Feng Yue recognized the voice, disbelief etched on his face.

“I heard you detained someone today. I suppose he’s my friend; his name is Su Nantian.” Chen Tianguo mused.

“Yes, Elder Chen. It was all a misunderstanding—everything’s been clarified. He’ll be leaving shortly.” Feng Yue hurried to explain.

“Hmph, that’s good.”

“Rest assured,” the voice said before disconnecting.

What? Even Elder Chen considered him a friend!

Feng Yue felt his mouth go dry. He gulped down a large drink and rushed out of the office.

Both Elder Lin and Elder Chen had personally called to inquire about Su Nantian’s case, wondering who this snowflake truly was.

“Captain, something’s wrong—there’s a problem!” A man hurriedly approached Feng Yue.

“What is it? Walk and talk,” Feng Yue continued moving without pause.

“The interrogation room—Wu Jun is injured.” The man panted.

“What?!”

Feng Yue quickened his pace. Wu Jun was injured? He was one of the team’s top fighters!

And yet, it happened in the interrogation room.

Could it be that boy?

Feng Yue rushed to the interrogation room’s entrance and saw Zhang Xue storming in from another direction.

“Sister Xue, look at this.” A pretty woman grabbed Zhang Xue’s arm.

“Xiaowen, what is it? Let me tear this scoundrel apart,” Zhang Xue prepared to push Xiaowen aside but froze upon seeing the video in her hand.

The footage showed a blur of combat—two figures moving so fast that their actions were indistinct. If not for the moment they paused, one might have thought it a high-tech gadget.

Finally, one was kicked skyward and exploded into a mist of blood; even the video carried a faint rumble.

The clip was short.

After watching it, Zhang Xue was stunned. Gazing at the figure standing there and the rooftop, her instincts told her it was Su Nantian.

That lecherous scoundrel! A despicable rogue.

“This seems to be a fight between the man you brought back and Chi. I stumbled upon it online; it’s gone viral with over a billion views. I’ve enhanced the footage, but the distance was too great; the quality is terrible—still unclear,” Xiaowen remarked, puzzled by the speed.

She was certain the video hadn’t been altered. “This is the reconstructed image.”

Zhang Xue was now certain it was Su Nantian. Though the image bore only a five-point resemblance, her woman’s intuition was infallible.

Thus, everything he’d said earlier must be true.

Zhang Xue was momentarily dazed but, recalling that scene, Su Nantian was unforgivable—absolutely unforgivable.

“Zhang Xue, are you certain this is the young man who killed Chi?” Feng Yue joined her after watching the video, equally skeptical but recalling Chen Tianguo and Elder Lin’s calls, he realized this youth was no ordinary person.

Yet when he saw Chi explode into a rain of blood, an idea flashed through his mind—Explosion Body Pill.

This youth’s strength was terrifying.

Years ago, his brother had fallen from a cliff with an enemy who’d consumed an Explosion Body Pill, turning into a mist of blood. Though this man was thin, unlike the plump mercenary who’d turned into a ball of flesh, he would never forget that scene.

Later, he researched extensively and learned that sustained heavy blows could thin a person but amplify their strength beyond comprehension—no human effort could counter it. Hence, he’d recognized the man instantly.

That day, his survival had been miraculous; it remained etched in his memory.

Hence, he’d come to Fengcheng, his brother’s hometown, to serve as a lowly squad leader.

“Yes!” Zhang Xue gritted her teeth.

“Then, since the truth is clear, release him and issue a reward. Also, your father has already called me.”

“No, he…”

Chapter 42: The Jealousy Vessel

Zhang Xue had intended to mention Su Nantian unfastening her buttons but stopped herself. Her snow-white teeth bit her lip, unsure how to proceed.

“What’s wrong with him?”

Feng Yue had never seen Zhang Xue act so flustered—like a girl, which surprised him.

She was usually bold and unrefined, but today she’d turned timid.

“Nothing!” Zhang Xue left with a huff.

Even Xiaowen, who was close to Zhang Xue, stared in bewilderment. She hadn’t expected her sister to display such shyness. If it were an emoji, she’d surely die.

Xiaowen glanced at the photo she’d just taken and stuck out her tongue, laughing heartily.

Feng Yue sighed in relief. Fortunately, this young man hadn’t erred; otherwise, the girl would’ve caused chaos.

Her strong will was both a blessing and a curse.

He recalled the last incident and winced.

Feng Yue pushed open the interrogation room door.

His face darkened instantly—why was he still surrounded?

“Everyone, leave.”

“This is truly an honor. The matter has been clarified; you may now depart,” Feng Yue bowed, his heart trembling. If he angered this man, his small temple might be destroyed.

“Haha, Captain, no need for such courtesy,” Su Nantian smiled.

“You truly humble me,” Feng Yue replied.

They exchanged smiles and walked toward the door.

Numerous onlookers turned their heads, whispering: Who is this?

Brought in under guard, yet leaving with the captain in high spirits—this shift was too swift.

Though not the first time, what made this young man so special?

“Nantian, are you alright?” Lin Suyun rushed in from outside.

“Good evening, Miss Lin,” Feng Yue was surprised—this was Miss Lin’s boyfriend.

Miss Lin!

So this man was her boyfriend!

“I’m fine, but some people are quite upset,” Su Nantian glanced at Zhang Xue standing at the door.

“I’ll let you off this time, but if I find another chance, I won’t spare you,” Zhang Xue said, her face flushed with anger.

“Has anyone told you that your angry expression is quite beautiful? And next time, be sure to fasten it properly.”

Su Nantian eyed Zhang Xue’s chest with deliberate intent.

Zhang Xue’s gaze was like lightning, burning into Su Nantian as if she wished to grind him into dust a hundred times. If eyes could kill, Su Nantian would’ve been disemboweled countless times.

The onlookers were stunned.

Zhang Xue was jealous!

Two women vying for one man!

Who was so bold to provoke Zhang Xue? Did he not wish to live?

Feng Yue’s eyes lit up. Su Nantian had taken an interest in Zhang Xue; if they developed a unique relationship, he’d gain some confidence. However, Miss Lin was no easy opponent.

Feng Yue smiled at the two, finally finding someone to rein in Zhang Xue.

“This is my boyfriend; let’s go, Nantian,” Lin Suyun said, her brows furrowed slightly as she pulled Su Nantian’s arm.

“Don’t think too highly of yourself; I wouldn’t even consider you,” Zhang Xue scoffed.

She crossed her arms, and her chest swelled slightly, the buttons barely holding. Some onlookers felt their blood boil, growing hot and restless.

A few even sneezed blood.

Instantly, the tension was palpable.

Lin Suyun snorted and glanced at Zhang Xue’s chest, then at her own. Embarrassed, she pulled Su Nantian out briskly.

Zhang Xue felt a surge of triumph, as if she’d gained an advantage.

Regaining her senses, she noticed many eyes watching her and quickly left.

Unexpectedly, she blushed!

Had she fallen for him?

It seemed the rival was formidable. Miss Lin of the Lin Clan!

Zhang Xue’s wealth and resources were immense—she still had a chance.

Indeed, even I find it hard to resist!

Rumors spread like wildfire.

Wu Jun overheard and glared coldly.

…

After exiting, Lin Suyun released Su Nantian immediately and strode ahead.

Su Nantian shook his head in无奈 and followed her. They both got into the car.

Lin Suyun said nothing, flooring the accelerator; the red Lamborghini shot forward instantly.

The speed skyrocketed.

“Suyun, slow down—speeding,” Su Nantian urged.

“That’s exactly what you wanted, isn’t it? You could find that woman again,” Lin Suyun stopped the car abruptly, her eyes red.

“No, it’s not what you think—I just found it amusing; I was teasing her.” Su Nantian rubbed his nose, explaining.

“Why explain to me? I’m not your girlfriend?” Lin Suyun said.

“You called me your boyfriend just now, so you must explain,” Su Nantian replied seriously.

“You’ve admitted it then.” Lin Suyun’s heart leaped; she leaned in and kissed Su Nantian’s cheek, her face flushed.

Su Nantian didn’t object; the unexpected kiss left him stunned.

Feeling the lingering warmth on his cheek and the faint fragrance in his nose, he was momentarily dazed.

Seeing Lin Suyun’s reddened eyes, he didn’t know how to respond.

“By the way, Grandpa said the Gao family sent someone to see you. That’s why I returned and got a new car to fetch you.”

“Gao family? Never heard of it,” Su Nantian frowned.

“The Gao family—Grandpa said they’re a clan with cultivators, usually low-key. They’re the true masters of Fengcheng. Even Grandpa is wary of them.”

Lin Suyun’s expression darkened.

“This car was a gift from the Chen family; they’re wise. Otherwise, we’d have to take a taxi—can’t let them underestimate you. After all, you’re my Lin Suyun’s boyfriend.” When she said “boyfriend,” her heart fluttered, and she glanced at Su Nantian, who was still dazed. He was truly heartless.

Cultivator family!

A glint of determination flashed in Su Nantian’s eyes, like a dragon about to awaken, destined to astonish the world.

This was his first encounter with such a clan.

It seemed there were many cultivators on Earth; the world was far more complex than it appeared.

Why hadn’t they heard of them in the Immortal Realm?

Su Nantian didn’t dwell on these questions, as he would uncover the answers himself.

“Right, Lin family’s daughter’s boyfriend—his brilliance will blind their titanium alloy eyes; even with sunglasses, it won’t help. Rest assured, no one can take me from your side.”

Su Nantian snapped back to reality and said.

Two millennia had passed without such a feeling—heartbeats!

“You’re still so conceited. If I hadn’t taken an interest in you, you’d still be a bachelor,” Lin Suyun’s heart was overjoyed but she wouldn’t admit it.

…

Chapter 43: The Young Monk, the Soup is Cold.

Lin family’s hall.

Lin Tianyi sat at the head of the table, conversing with a middle-aged man.

He drank cup after cup of tea, while the middle-aged man never raised his cup.

“Grandpa, Nantian has returned,” Lin Suyun exclaimed happily upon entering.

“Suyun, this is Master Gao of the Gao family.” Lin Tianyi smiled, pleased to see Suyun so close to this young man.

He had always favored this youth; now that the Gao family had sent someone today, he valued Su Nantian even more.

“Hello, Master Gao.” Lin Suyun greeted.

“Greetings, Elder Lin,” Su Nantian addressed him but didn’t greet Master Gao. He only greeted Lin Tianyi because he was Suyun’s grandfather.

As for Master Gao, he didn’t know him or how to address him.

He glanced briefly and was surprised to find this man was a cultivator of the Fourth Level of Cultivation.

Yet, in his eyes, he was still a mere ant.

“Hearing of your beauty and charm, I’ve finally met you—more stunning than the tales,” the middle-aged man praised without resentment for Su Nantian’s oversight.

“Ah, this must be Master Su. Indeed, he exudes an aura of grandeur. I heard Master Su healed Grandpa Lin’s illness and came specifically to visit.”

Master Gao was astonished; he couldn’t read this young man at all, as if he were ordinary.

Yet his feat of killing Chi confirmed he was no ordinary person—definitely not a common cultivator.

“Did you monitor me?” Su Nantian’s gaze turned cold.

“No, no—Master Su, don’t misunderstand; we didn’t monitor anyone. In fact, everything in Fengcheng is under the Gao family’s control.” Master Gao nearly lost composure, sensing danger in that instant.

Though only for a moment, he was certain this young man could kill him.

Thinking of the Gao family behind him, his arrogance remained unshaken; he steadied himself but was amiable, as Master Gao had ordered to treat Su Nantian respectfully.

“What then? If you have such formidable abilities, why seek me out?” Su Nantian asked.

“Honestly, the Gao family has a daughter named Gao Jingjing; her hidden illness has flared up. I hope Master Su can heal her. The Gao family will surely reward you generously.” Master Gao paused, continuing, “Also, the mastermind behind the assassination is at Longshan Temple.”

“Oh, Longshan Temple?” Su Nantian felt suspicion.

“Master Su may rest assured; even if he flees elsewhere, the Gao family can find him. As for why we didn’t deliver him directly to you, it’s because we weren’t sure if Master Su could heal my lady. Also, Longshan Temple is deep; it’s tied to another cultivator clan, the Li family. It seems they’re related to Wu Shengmen as well. Though he’s just a discarded son of the Li family, still…” Master Gao explained, fearing Su Nantian would think they were using him.

“Ah, so even the Gao family dares not act against him.” Su Nantian smirked and interrupted, “I’ll visit the Gao family; we’ll discuss it after.”

“Then I’m indebted to you,” Master Gao sighed in relief, finally completing his master’s task.

He gazed at Su Nantian again, still unable to fathom him.

After parting, he left.

“Nantian, maybe it’s better to let it go. That man is feared even by the Gao family; I’ll send more people to protect Suyun.” Lin Tianyi said.

“Then it’s like guarding against thieves at night, Grandpa. Rest assured, I’ll be fine.”

A secular family calling itself a cultivator? The Li and Gao families were beneath his notice.

Lin Tianyi looked at Su Nantian with concern but said nothing more.

He gave Suyun a reassuring glance and left.

…

Longshan Temple.

Su Nantian gazed up at the mountain’s peak, Longshan Temple. Upon arriving, he felt a rich flow of spiritual energy—though not yet obvious, it was far better than the city.

Unexpectedly, there was a formation here, a gathering spiritual energy array. Yet to Su Nantian, it was too crude.

He could even enhance it tenfold.

As he climbed the mountain, there was no one around; only a young monk stood at the temple’s gate.

With rosy lips and white teeth, he looked quite refined.

“Master, the abbot is not here today; please return tomorrow.”

The young monk approached hurriedly, recalling his master’s words and feeling a twinge of pain.

Su Nantian’s eyes lit up—this young monk had good potential; it was a pity he hadn’t cultivated.

“Young monk, want to learn martial arts secrets?”

“No need; my master said he’d teach me. Master, please leave.”

“Has he never taught you? Reciting sutras is no good. Be my disciple, and there are also beautiful sisters.” Su Nantian smiled, surprised to find such a gifted young monk on this remote mountain.

“Beautiful sisters!” The young monk’s eyes lit up; there were no women here, and he’d forgotten how long it had been since he saw one.

He thought of his master’s warning against lust and the magazine he’d found, causing his bottom to ache.

As he hesitated,

“Young monk, the soup is cold; it’s already gone. Hurry and eat.”

The young monk turned, his eyes flashing fear.

“Master, you should descend the mountain.”

Li Fei looked at the person beside the young monk, as if seeing a ghost; his hair stood on end, and his legs trembled.

“Uncle Li, what’s wrong?” The young monk saw Uncle Li pale and trembling like a ghost, surprised. Uncle Li was afraid?

Li Fei pointed at Su Nantian, trembling but unable to speak.

The young monk followed his uncle’s gaze and covered his mouth in shock.

Why was Uncle Li so afraid?

He had seen Uncle Li’s abilities before, which he admired. So this man must be…

The young monk gradually widened his eyes.

“Unexpected, we’ve met again so soon.” Su Nantian grinned.

“Uncle Li.” Li Fei struggled to overcome his fear, shouting desperately.

A moment later, a figure flew out of the temple. Seeing Su Nantian’s appearance, he was also stunned—so quickly found him.

It seemed a life-or-death battle was inevitable.

“Young monk, step back a bit; I don’t want to hurt you.” Su Nantian smiled at the astonished young monk.

“Boy, are you here to die so quickly?” Li Yukun feigned composure.

“Die? Are you sure I’m the one coming to die?” Su Nantian’s gaze sharpened.

Li Yukun felt a strong pressure, like a tiger descending from the mountain—overwhelming and intimidating. His palms grew sweaty.

Chapter 44: Catastrophic Defeat

“Do you know who’s behind me? Can a nameless boy like you provoke them?”

Though he was an abandoned son of the Li family, he still represented their face.

Meanwhile, he was stalling for time, waiting for reinforcements.

“Even if you are an abandoned son, what does that matter?” Su Nantian mocked.

“You must know the power of Yanjing’s Li family.”

Li Yukun sneered.

“An abandoned son, or rather, a bastard—otherwise, why would they abandon you?” Su Nantian sneered.

“I hate hearing those words,” Li Yukun grew angry.

“Even if I am an abandoned son, the Yanjing Li family won’t ignore me; kill me, and you’ll die no matter where you run. The Li family ranks forty-first among the forty-six clans on the Immortal榜.” Li Yukun boasted, speaking of the Li family with pride.

After all, he was a discarded son but still held a position as an elder in Wu Shengmen.

Su Nantian ignored him, looking at the young monk: “Is this your master? He seems so useless.”

“Yes, my master rarely appears; he never takes me with him and beats me constantly,” the young monk’s voice grew quieter, almost inaudible.

“I’ll help you avenge him,” Su Nantian patted the young monk’s head.

“Hmph! You’re a traitor, turning your back on me—wait till I don’t take you in.”

Li Yukun felt relieved upon seeing this, thinking he was afraid. If the Li family’s name had been so effective, he wouldn’t have feared it so much.

Yet he dared to target this young monk—this was his hard-earned prize, meant for Wu Shengmen’s master as a gift when he turned eighteen.

It was said that the Wu Shengmen’s master loved fresh, delicate boys—such boys were rare now.

“I advise you not to target this boy; the Li family won’t let you live.”

Su Nantian frowned, disapproving of anyone daring to speak out.

How many such discarded sons had he killed before?

“Hmph, don’t be arrogant.” Li Yukun’s anger flared; seeing Su Nantian again, his confidence wavered.

After all, he wasn’t a blood relative; if he died, what use was it? So he could only glare at Su Nantian, hoping to intimidate him and stall for time.

The next moment,
Li Yukun’s pupils widened as a figure rapidly approached him. It felt like a mountain crushing down, the air solidified; his breath caught.

His heart froze with terror. He raised his hand to retaliate, but it lost sensation and dropped.

He tried to retreat.
Crack!
His legs snapped, and he fell to his knees.

“Ah,” he felt a shiver of fear; how could this be so strong? He had thought he might lose, but never imagined no chance to fight.

Like a hawk catching a chicken, there was no doubt.
No opportunity for resistance.
The tearing pain at his legs made him disbelieving.

“Hiding in the shadows this long, now you won’t come out? When will you?” Su Nantian coldly said to the grassy area ahead.

“Haha, I didn’t expect to be found so deeply,” a middle-aged man in gray robes jumped out from the grass.

“Fan Jin, what are you waiting for? Kill him immediately,” Li Yukun saw the外援 from Wu Shengmen, but they refused to help. His heart sank; these greedy people were no good.

“Why the rush? You’re not dead yet, are you? If I save you, what’s the price?” Fan Jin rubbed his hands, eyes glowing gold.

“Add two more,” Li Yukun gritted his teeth.

“Three.”

“Fine.”

To save his life, nothing mattered; but Fan Jin was exploiting the situation. He noted it down.

“Haha.” Fan Jin didn’t care about his gaze, looking at Su Nantian. “Boy, let him live; I’ll let you live too. We each get what we want. Look at him, he’s already crippled—enough.”

Fan Jin didn’t want to act because this person was unreadable. He wasn’t willing to take the risk, even though he had reached the Ninth Level of Cultivation and was one step from breakthrough.

Caution is the key to long-term survival; otherwise, he would have died already.

“Haha, you’re still stuck at the Ninth Level of Cultivation after a lifetime. You should be grateful,” Su Nantian said.

This kind of person he had seen many times—cowardly and afraid to die.

“Boy, don’t be stubborn,”
Fan Jin was startled but didn’t believe this child had much ability.

“You can try.” Su Nantian said calmly.

Fan Jin stopped talking, raising his hands. A white light flowed, crystalline and jade-like, as if it could split mountains and rivers.

Black winds rose around him, strange and eerie. His internal energy poured out without restraint, gathering into his hands and feet.

As he waved his hands gracefully up and down, surrounding leaves were swept into the air, swirling like knives. The air around was cut, emitting a roaring sound that pierced the eardrums.

He smiled confidently, not stopping my buildup.

The young monk watched this scene, his eyes widening. This was stronger than his master’s aura—so powerful.

If one day I could do this, capturing a beauty’s heart would be effortless.

Li Fei was also happy but couldn’t smile; he dared not before the result.

It was clear how much Su Nantian had left in his mind, an area of shadow that couldn’t be measured.

Li Yukun watched this scene and laughed heartily, forgetting his pain.
He seemed to see Su Nantian being cut into pieces by sharp leaves.

Su Nantian glanced at him and kicked him aside.

At that moment,
Fan Jin’s feet flashed with countless shadows, forming a hurricane rushing toward Su Nantian. Fast enough to only see a blur.

“Be careful!” The young monk shouted in alarm.

Su Nantian raised his head; Fan Jin was already at his front, his crystalline palm extended, creating a whistling wind.

Su Nantian didn’t dodge or block; he simply punched, a simple punch without any flourish, no trace of fire.

At the point of contact, they separated instantly.

Fan Jin felt as if he had collided with a high-speed truck and was sent flying like a kite.

“You’ve poisoned me, cough, cough—no one will survive three days.”
Fan Jin hadn’t expected to be sent flying but was confident in his poison.

“Do you mean this?”
Chapter 45: A Second Visit

The next moment, Fan Jin looked at Su Nantian’s hand in horror; the black poison mark slowly peeled off his hand.

Li Yukun was stunned, Li Fei was stunned; their faces turned pale like lime powder.
It felt like a farce, they were clowns performing their roles.

“Is this your strength?” Su Nantian said calmly.

But this voice was piercing to the ears of those around, more so than the previous roaring wind.

Fan Jin was a fifth master of Wu Shengmen, a genuine Ninth Level Cultivator. None had hidden abilities.

Yet he was defeated by an unknown young man in one punch.
And it was a near-Immortal-level attack.

How could this young man have defeated him so easily?

Li Fei wondered what monster he had provoked.
Li Yukun regretted it deeply.

Fan Jin was furious; if not for those few spirit stones, he wouldn’t have taken this risk.
Provoking a person of unknown strength.

He looked at Li Yukun with resentment; if it weren’t for this man, he wouldn’t have been defeated today.

Su Nantian looked at Fan Jin and pulled out the mysterious token he had yet to understand.

“Do you recognize this?”

“This is the Immortal Palace Token; it’s not a secret. It appears once every century. No one who has obtained it has returned alive. No one knows what happened inside, but each time the token appears, cultivators go mad with bloodshed. Especially those nearing their end, after which the token reappears in the world.”

Fan Jin saw this token and felt hope; he immediately told Su Nantian everything he knew.

“There are four tokens in total. When they gather, the Immortal Palace’s door opens; only those with these tokens can enter.”

Fan Jin finished breathing heavily, fearing he would die sooner.

“Good, I’ll give you a chance to live—kill these two men, and I’ll let you go.” Su Nantian’s voice rang out again.

If he hadn’t felt any killing intent from Fan Jin, and his answer satisfied him, he wouldn’t have let him live.

“No, no—give me all my spirit stones and spare my life,” Li Yukun’s last hope was shattered. He had hoped Fan Jin would fight to the death with him, exchanging lives for a chance at survival.

It was all over!

He looked at Su Nantian with begging eyes, pulling out five spirit stones he cherished from his pocket.

But Su Nantian didn’t even glance at him; he hadn’t expected Earth to have spirit stones, and their quality was high.

Fan Jin didn’t react immediately; he had thought himself dead but now had hope. This back-and-forth between life and death was uncomfortable.

He quickly thanked Su Nantian, ignoring his injuries, and immediately attacked Li Yukun and Li Fei.

Fan Jin eyed the five spirit stones with desire,
but could only think about it.

He handed them to Su Nantian and prepared to leave.

“Wait.”

Fan Jin’s body froze instantly, like a wooden post; he didn’t dare move. Cold sweat poured down his back—he felt eyes like knives watching him.

Was it because of the Immortal Palace Token to kill and silence?

It was likely!
He had heard that some bigwigs liked to toy with people, enjoying the feeling of controlling others’ lives. It brought a unique thrill.
Some even had perverted habits, finding climax!
Floating on clouds!

“Take the bodies away.”
Su Nantian frowned at the bloodstain on the ground.

Hearing this, Fan Jin sighed in relief; his heart finally relaxed.
He cleaned the ground and left with the two corpses.

The young monk stared in awe at this scene, as his master and uncle were easily dealt with.

“Don’t worry; no one will bully you again.”
Su Nantian smiled at the young monk.

“Cultivation is an act of defying heaven; such experiences are common.”
“Master, I pay my respects.”
The young monk was overjoyed.

“Come on, Master, I’ll find you a beautiful sister.”
“Wow, a beautiful sister!”
The young monk’s eyes lit up and followed Su Nantian.

He wasn’t disturbed by the previous events; the allure of beauty was不可思议.

Su Nantian was satisfied with the young monk and the temple.
He decided to strengthen the gathering spiritual energy array here when he had time.

…

Returning to the Lin family, he first placed the young monk there.

Unexpectedly, Master Gao had already arrived.
This time, his gaze toward Su Nantian was different—admiration mixed with reverence. Such a person who could defeat a Ninth Level Cultivator in one move was rare, even among the Gao family’s old masters.
This youth’s age surpassed even the Gao family’s eldest son.

Such a person, if not a friend, could not be an enemy.

“Indeed, a hero emerges young,” Master Gao said, presenting the jade box with both hands. “This is a gift from my master; I hope Master Su won’t find it offensive.”

“Your information is indeed swift,” Su Nantian opened the jade box and was immediately impressed.

It was a jade stone, about the size of his palm, crystalline and transparent, white like mutton fat. It felt cool in his hand, with spiritual energy swirling around it—eternally alive.

Though the spiritual energy was minimal, once this phenomenon occurred, it indicated a significant change in the jade’s quality. Most importantly, it could inscribe advanced talismans.

It was common in the Immortal Realm but unexpected on Earth; such things usually only appeared in areas with rich spiritual energy, where long-term nurturing caused this transformation.

“I’ll be honored to accept it,” Su Nantian said, understanding Master Gao’s intentions. It was both a gesture of goodwill and an attempt to heal the Gao family’s daughter. However, he had confidence in his medical skills and felt no guilt.

As he held the jade, Lin Suyun’s image surfaced in his mind—perfect for two life-saving talismans, one for Lin Suyun and another for the young monk.

They could nourish the body, ward off all illnesses, and guard against emergencies.

Master Gao saw Su Nantian accept the gift and was also highly satisfied.
