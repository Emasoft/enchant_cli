Su Nantian was not fond of these foods, but he did not wish to offend Zhang Mengyao’s feelings, so he followed her along.

When Zhang Mengyao felt she had eaten enough, she noticed Su Nantian still leisurely eating the last portion of cabbage.

She rose to the cashier’s counter to settle the bill, but soon returned to her seat.

“You’ve already paid, right?” Zhang Mengyao said with a hint of apology.

“It’s fine, I’ll treat you.”

“Once I’ve fully recovered, then you can repay me.”

“That’s fine, thank you.”

“However, how do you get home?” The two gazed at the dimming sky. Su Nantian abruptly shifted the topic, asking, “Is it far?”

Chapter 177: Treatment

Zhang Mengyao nodded sheepishly, “Take the No. 8 bus first, then transfer to the No. 13 bus, and finally take the Line 1 Circular Route.”

Su Nantian’s lips twitched. “The Line 1 Circular Route?”

Zhang Mengyao’s face instantly blushed, and she nodded softly.

“Taxi.”

Su Nantian immediately hailed an empty taxi beside him.

After Zhang Mengyao recited the route, Su Nantian had already decided to take a taxi.

The Line 1 Circular Route… was that a vehicle for the suburbs?

Sitting in the backseat, the two had different thoughts. The driver muttered to himself.

“Ah, you’re going so far? You both look like students; I can charge you a little less. But it’s so late—what are you doing there? Don’t tell me you live there. It doesn’t look like it; people who live there are poor. You’re wearing the uniform of Fengyue Academy—there’s no way you’re poor.”

Zhang Mengyao’s face turned crimson.

Su Nantian, seated in the back, felt a bit annoyed. He slipped his right hand into his pocket and formed a seal; a faint blue light flickered within, causing the driver to cease his chatter and focus on driving.

An hour later, the two finally stepped out of the taxi.

Su Nantian gazed at the slum before him, a complex emotion flickering in his heart.

A girl like Zhang Mengyao, with her physical imperfection and bottom-tier family background—Su Nantian sighed inwardly, his gaze toward her laced with pity.

Zhang Mengyao led Su Nantian into the house, gesturing to a chair beside her.

“Please sit; there’s nothing special here. I’ll get you some water.”

Su Nantian nodded slightly and did not refuse.

He surveyed the cramped space of less than twenty square meters.

Under the dim lighting, it was barely possible to discern the interior: two beds, a table, and two chairs.

That was all. Yet it was spotless, with no dust—evidently maintained by Zhang Mengyao’s daily efforts.

Seeing Su Nantian gazing around, she instinctively lowered her head and handed him a cup of warm water.

Su Nantian took it and sipped.

“Then let’s begin.”

“Already? I’m not prepared,” Zhang Mengyao said, flustered yet secretly eager.

“You don’t need to prepare anything—just lie on the bed and close your eyes.” Su Nantian smiled.

“Ah, is it that simple?” Zhang Mengyao’s heart suddenly quickened.

“Yes, that simple.”

Su Nantian then retrieved a roll of silver needles from his sleeve.

Seeing this, Zhang Mengyao no longer hesitated; she removed her shoes and lay on the bed, closing her eyes.

Su Nantian approached, pushing aside Zhang Mengyao’s thick bangs to reveal the birthmark that had plagued her for twenty years.

If he could heal paralysis, this small mark was no challenge.

He took a silver needle and directly pierced Zhang Mengyao’s face.

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh.

Su Nantian inserted three needles around the birthmark, forming a triangle.

With swift hand seals, ethereal qi flowed from his hands into the three needles.

The qi coursed through the trembling silver needles, seeping into the birthmark.

The deep brown mark visibly faded; a dark brown substance gradually oozed from the needles.

When all three needles turned deep brown, Su Nantian ceased his actions, brushing his long fingers across Zhang Mengyao’s face. The needles fell into his hand.

At that moment, the door creaked open.

A lean young man saw a stranger in his home and his sister lying on the bed. Without hesitation, he lunged forward with a punch.

Su Nantian sidestepped; the young man barely reacted before missing entirely.

Zhang Mengyao heard the commotion and opened her eyes, catching sight of her brother Zhang Xiaojun about to attack Su Nantian.

“No, Brother, I’m fine.”

Zhang Xiaojun saw Zhang Mengyao unharmed and shielded her, grabbing a nearby chair as if to strike Su Nantian.

Zhang Mengyao quickly grabbed Zhang Xiaojun’s arm, explaining, “He’s my classmate; he’s not a bad person.”

Zhang Xiaojun eyed Su Nantian suspiciously, still clutching the chair.

“I saw him eyeing you with ill intent; don’t be deceived by this hypocrite.”

“You’re mistaken, Brother—he’s treating me.” Zhang Mengyao hurriedly explained, fearing Zhang Xiaojun would strike.

“How are you? You were fine earlier—when did you get sick?” Zhang Xiaojun asked rapidly.

“Don’t you remember? My birthmark.” Zhang Mengyao pushed back her bangs, revealing the mark.

Zhang Xiaojun’s eyes widened in disbelief, staring at something he’d never forget.

He gasped, “The color has faded.”

Zhang Mengyao quickly grabbed the mirror on the table and looked. Her eyes welled with tears.

She tightly embraced Zhang Xiaojun.

Su Nantian watched the two siblings embrace in joy, feeling immense happiness.

He had always regarded Zhang Mengyao as a resilient girl, yet she also possessed a tender side within her family.

The two wept while embracing each other.

Su Nantian felt an indescribable emotion.

For years, Zhang Mengyao had endured that mark; Zhang Xiaojun’s sacrifice for his sister was equally touching.

These moments deepened Su Nantian’s admiration for the siblings.

Since his rebirth, he had sought a loyal follower to assist him in completing tasks.

He would not remain on Earth forever; eventually, he would enter the cultivation realm.

To ensure Lin Suyun’s safety, he had to strategize carefully on Earth.

Finding a helper was essential.

Yet Su Nantian understood the world’s harshness—trust was rare, and finding a reliable ally would require starting from scratch.

Zhang Xiaojun fit his criteria perfectly.

Though currently an obscure thug in the slums, Su Nantian sensed his potential. With proper training, his strength would be formidable.

Such talent wasted in the slums was a disgrace.

Chapter 178: Heart-Pounding Speculation

Only those he valued were exceptional talents.

Brave but foolish—no. Wise but lacking courage—he despised such people.

Zhang Xiaojun was an exception—honest, with remarkable talent and potential.

Had it not been for his family’s plight, Zhang Xiaojun would never have become a thug.

After deciding, Su Nantian focused on convincing Zhang Xiaojun to assist him.

Zhang Mengyao had likely cried enough, her sobs subdued into quiet sniffles. Zhang Xiaojun also recovered from his joy.

The siblings released each other, glancing awkwardly at Su Nantian.

Zhang Xiaojun’s gaze now carried respect.

Su Nantian had dimmed Zhang Mengyao’s birthmark—though only slightly, Zhang Xiaojun believed that with two more treatments, her face would be flawless.

This convinced him; his doubts vanished.

“Thank you for healing my sister’s birthmark.”

Zhang Xiaojun bowed deeply, filled with gratitude.

When he stood again, their eyes met.

Zhang Xiaojun was puzzled by Su Nantian’s intent—there was an unusual meaning in his gaze, strange yet indescribable.

Yet he could not articulate it.

Suddenly, a terrifying thought struck him: Could this man be gay, lusting after his beauty?

He felt a surge of panic.

He feared nothing and no one, but this inner revulsion clashed with his hope to remove his sister’s scar.

He gradually relinquished the last of his pride.

Su Nantian observed Zhang Xiaojun’s composure and calmness, deepening his regard for him.

Meanwhile, Zhang Mengyao, lost in thought, saw Su Nantian and her brother’s gaze. They fell silent.

She sensed something was wrong, quickly loosening her grip on her brother and rushing to Su Nantian.

“Don’t stand there; you must have found my brother’s behavior amusing. We were just too happy…”

“I understand, it’s fine.” Su Nantian interrupted her. Zhang Mengyao nodded and pulled two chairs from the table.

“Su Nantian, Brother, please sit; let’s talk.” Zhang Mengyao urged.

Su Nantian finally noticed the chair—its paint had worn off, revealing its wooden hue, yet it was spotlessly clean.

Su Nantian sat without hesitation.

Zhang Mengyao, delighted, pulled her brother into the chair.

Zhang Xiaojun sat silently beside Su Nantian, while Zhang Mengyao smiled warmly behind her brother.

“I think you’re quite capable; would you like to join me?” Su Nantian initiated the conversation.

Zhang Xiaojun was stunned, his heart pounding like a drum. He could hear it clearly.

He thought: Had my expression revealed my thoughts?

But this question shouldn’t be asked in front of his sister. His sexuality?

Why was it so direct? Couldn’t he be more subtle?

Zhang Xiaojun glanced at Zhang Mengyao, ignoring Su Nantian’s question. “You’ve given my sister new hope; I’m grateful, but I don’t understand your intent. If you need something, look at our home—there’s nothing…”

His voice trailed off.

Zhang Mengyao couldn’t bear it and elbowed Zhang Xiaojun’s arm: “Brother! You’ve misunderstood!”

“Don’t interfere in men’s matters.”

Zhang Xiaojun didn’t believe her. From Su Nantian’s gaze, he sensed this man was deeply hidden—too deep for his sister to comprehend.

Zhang Mengyao grew angry, taking a deep breath and avoiding Zhang Xiaojun’s gaze. She only apologized to Su Nantian, who waved it off: “It’s fine; your brother is just looking out for you.”

Zhang Xiaojun felt relieved.

“I healed Zhang Mengyao’s birthmark without reason; whether you believe it or not, I’ve never needed a reason. I have no demands on your family. If you insist on a demand…”

Su Nantian’s gaze burned into Zhang Xiaojun. “I need you.”

“Need me!”

Zhang Xiaojun pointed at himself, swallowing repeatedly. Though he had suspected it, hearing it from Su Nantian’s mouth left him disbelieving.

His mind echoed with three words: Need me! Need me! Need me!

Zhang Xiaojun’s gaze held suspicion, recalling the horrifying image. His skin prickled.

Thankfully, this man wasn’t after his sister. If he were, Zhang Xiaojun would sacrifice his body.

Zhang Xiaojun glanced at Zhang Mengyao, his emotions steadying. Yet this couldn’t be revealed to her.

This man’s background was unclear, his intentions strange—could he be a pervert or serial killer?

First save her, then deliver a devastating blow.

Zhang Xiaojun quickly recalled recent events—had he offended anyone?

He doubted Su Nantian’s identity. Though he gave Zhang Mengyao hope, he must ensure she wasn’t harmed. No one could harm her.

He straightened and asked, “What’s your purpose? Who are you?”

There was no free lunch; he understood this.

Zhang Xiaojun suddenly thought of his gang’s current disputes.

Could Su Nantian be from another gang?

“Are you sent by the other side?” Zhang Xiaojun’s expression changed, his voice cautious as he stared at Su Nantian seated calmly.

Zhang Mengyao grabbed Zhang Xiaojun and scolded, “Brother, what are you talking about?”

Chapter 179: Doubt

Zhang Mengyao’s words made her brother flinch. He ignored her question, still staring at Su Nantian.

Su Nantian shifted his head and said to Zhang Xiaojun, “I don’t know what gang you’re referring to, but I’m definitely not from them. Nor am I here to harm you.”

“Hmph, that’s easy to say. How can I believe you?” Zhang Xiaojun scoffed, his suspicion unrelenting.

Su Nantian didn’t get angry but smiled: “My situation is clear to your sister.”

Zhang Mengyao quickly stepped forward and nodded: “Yes, Brother, I know Su Nantian isn’t from the other side!”

The small room fell silent. Zhang Xiaojun persisted: “No one does something without a motive. Especially someone who healed my sister’s supposedly incurable birthmark in an afternoon—this is too incredible. I must doubt it.”

Zhang Xiaojun’s words solidified his belief that Su Nantian was up to no good. He had never met anyone without ulterior motives.

Su Nantian remained calm, thinking Zhang Xiaojun was impulsive and reckless—this was a mistake.

Su Nantian thought: I must teach him properly.

“I saved your sister out of classmate’s bond; it surprised me to find a useful talent here.” Su Nantian said.

“Recently, more accurately, in the future, I need an assistant to do my bidding. This candidate has eluded me until now. Today, seeing you, I believe you’re suitable.”

Zhang Xiaojun furrowed his brows. This was clearly a dismissive answer—saving his sister and offering to elevate him? Such luck was unheard of.

Even if it existed, it wouldn’t be for him.

Zhang Mengyao exclaimed: “Su Nantian, you want my brother to work for you?”

Su Nantian nodded without comment.

Zhang Mengyao was even happier: “If he works for you, won’t he escape this hardship!”

Su Nantian smiled and nodded again, adding: “But the decision is his.”

Zhang Mengyao immediately turned to Zhang Xiaojun, anxious for his reply.

Honestly, she didn’t want her brother to become a thug for her.

If Zhang Xiaojun could work with Su Nantian, she believed that with Su Nantian’s background and strength, Zhang Xiaojun would eventually rise. This was far better than being a thug in the slums!

Zhang Xiaojun furrowed his brows: “You want me to work for you?”

Zhang Xiaojun re-examined Su Nantian, sensing hidden meanings. Perhaps he truly needed his body.

This thought made him gaze at Su Nantian with suspicion.

He continued: “If I’m not mistaken, you’re just a student; your family must be well-off. Why choose me?”

Zhang Xiaojun’s doubts were genuine; to some unaware, Su Nantian appeared merely a student—spending time on leisure instead of work.

Zhang Xiaojun furrowed his brows again: “You’re not hiring me to hang out and waste time, are you?”

Su Nantian shook his head, unimpressed by Zhang Xiaojun’s imagination. If he knew the latter’s thoughts, he might have beaten him up.

Su Nantian decided to clarify: “I’m not a rich kid; I have some assets under my name. If you work for me, your and your sister’s lives will be much better.”

The last sentence struck Zhang Xiaojun. He dropped out of school and became a thug for his sister’s sake. If Su Nantian was telling the truth…

“If you don’t believe me, come with me.”

……

An hour later, the three took a taxi to the hotel under Lin’s Group. Su Nantian stepped out first, paid the fare, and headed for the entrance.

Zhang Xiaojun rushed to grab Su Nantian’s arm, exclaiming: “What are you doing? Do you know where this is! Are you planning to enter?”

Su Nantian raised an eyebrow: “Why can’t I go in?”

Zhang Xiaojun hurriedly replied: “What are you going to do inside? Fight or eat for free?”

Su Nantian’s lips twitched; he didn’t want to explain. He walked in directly.

Zhang Xiaojun, seeing Su Nantian’s determined look, shook his head and followed with Zhang Mengyao.

This hotel was where Su Nantian and Lin Suyun resided, the same one where he dueled with Chi Jue on the rooftop. The lobby manager had already formed an indelible impression of Su Nantian.

As soon as Su Nantian stepped through the revolving door, the security guard bowed deeply and immediately called the lobby manager.

Zhang Xiaojun was momentarily stunned by their attitude.

Seeing the lobby manager rush over, his eyes nearly dropped to the ground.

Su Nantian didn’t hurry.

The lobby manager approached Su Nantian, bowed respectfully, and said: “Mr. Su, your private room has been prepared.”

Su Nantian had no doubt about the manager’s efficiency. He walked ahead, smiling warmly as he introduced himself, leaving no room for criticism.

After entering the private room, Su Nantian sat at his designated seat.

Zhang Xiaojun stepped on the carpet, feeling as if it were filled with cotton—his steps uneven and unreal. The lobby manager was perceptive; seeing Zhang Xiaojun hesitate at the door, he extended a hand: “Please?”

Zhang Xiaojun nodded hurriedly: “You too, please…”

The lobby manager chuckled and stopped worrying about Zhang Xiaojun. He fetched tea and poured it for Su Nantian.

Then he took a golden menu from the cabinet and handed it to Su Nantian.

While Su Nantian ordered, Zhang Xiaojun cautiously sat down but couldn’t stop gazing at the private room.

Zhang Xiaojun’s doubts had vanished when he saw how the lobby manager treated Su Nantian.

Zhang Mengyao re-examined Su Nantian, realizing she had underestimated him.

Su Nantian casually pointed at the menu and glanced at Zhang Xiaojun, who was fidgeting. He tossed the menu into Zhang Xiaojun’s hands.

Zhang Xiaojun was startled, looking at Su Nantian in confusion.

Chapter 180: Resignation

Su Nantian said calmly, “I’ve ordered what I like. You order something too.”

Zhang Xiaojun had never dined in such a high-end place. Now, he was extremely cautious with the menu.

He also comforted Zhang Mengyao beside him.

Zhang Xiaojun was eager to order a few dishes, making the trip worthwhile. But when he opened the menu, his expression froze.

Su Nantian noticed Zhang Xiaojun’s discomfort and asked: “What’s wrong? Would you like another menu?”

Another menu? Zhang Xiaojun’s eyes lit up. He placed the current menu aside, patted his heart, and thought: “My goodness, just opening a tea costs 999…”

Zhang Xiaojun thought the first menu was the most expensive. Upon hearing Su Nantian’s question, he nodded immediately.

The lobby manager fetched a second menu. Instead of giving it to Su Nantian, he handed it directly to Zhang Xiaojun.

Under Su Nantian’s guidance, he also gave one to Zhang Mengyao.

Zhang Xiaojun smiled awkwardly and slowly opened the second menu.

This time, a fruit salad priced at 1800 caught his eye. He opened it and immediately closed it again. Su Nantian and the lobby manager were stunned.

“I… I’ve already had enough. I don’t need to order more.” Zhang Xiaojun put the menu back on the first one.

“Su Nantian, you don’t need to spend so much. We can just order something simple.” Zhang Mengyao glanced at the prices and closed the menu immediately.

The lobby manager quickly understood, crouching to whisper to Su Nantian: “This gentleman and lady are first-timers; they’re nervous. Let me add more dishes to please him without pressuring him.”

Su Nantian nodded and waved his hand. The lobby manager smiled and left the private room.

With no outsiders, Zhang Xiaojun finally spoke in disbelief: “You said you had some assets. Did it relate to Lin’s Group?”

Su Nantian replied, “Approximately.”

He didn’t continue the topic but told Zhang Mengyao: “Have some red wine.”

Before she could respond, Su Nantian got up and went to the cabinet. He opened a sandalwood door, revealing various aged red wines inside.

After selecting the wine, Zhang Xiaojun and Zhang Mengyao were still stunned, unable to recover.

Su Nantian didn’t call them; he simply took two highball glasses and poured a glass for Zhang Xiaojun.

Then, he poured one for himself.

The three clinked glasses; the sound echoed as they sipped the wine.

Su Nantian slowly savored it, its aroma lingering on his lips—like his reborn life, bitter yet sweet.

At this moment, the private room door opened, and a delicate cart was pushed in by a server. The lobby manager followed closely, then closed the door behind him.

Zhang Xiaojun was pulled back to reality by the door closing, his shock slightly fading.

To avoid appearing weak in front of others, he sat upright and forced himself to drink the wine.

The lobby manager quickly filled their table with dishes. Though Su Nantian had only ordered a few of his favorite dishes, the manager was skilled and filled the table completely.

Zhang Xiaojun watched each dish arrive, muttering “1800” each time. After all dishes were served, he couldn’t count the total cost.

He only knew this meal was worth more than three years of their living expenses.

Su Nantian dismissed the lobby manager and servers, then told Zhang Xiaojun and Zhang Mengyao: “Eat quickly.”

Zhang Xiaojun smiled, taking a piece of beef and placing it in Zhang Mengyao’s bowl.

“Eat more; you’re too thin.”

Zhang Mengyao thanked him and glanced at both, no longer pretending.

She took a piece of beef and chewed it. Immediately, she was captivated by the dish.

The beef was tender, and the sauce complemented it perfectly.

Zhang Mengyao praised it endlessly; she had never tasted such tender beef, with a flavor so unique and unforgettable.

She quickly took more pieces for Zhang Xiaojun, who, upon hearing her praise, wolfed down the food without regard for appearance.

Zhang Mengyao suddenly remembered something and hurriedly took some for Su Nantian.

Su Nantian smiled without saying much; he enjoyed their relaxed state, which was light and carefree. Though they lived hard lives, life was still joyful.

Seeing Zhang Xiaojun’s wolfing down, Su Nantian said: “In the future, when you come to this hotel, just say my name. The lobby manager has already recognized your face. As long as you don’t cause trouble, you can seek help here if needed.”

Zhang Xiaojun nodded and continued stuffing his mouth.

Zhang Mengyao slowly began eating, her mind preoccupied.

Su Nantian didn’t touch his chopsticks but sipped his wine slowly.

After a long silence, Zhang Xiaojun belched and asked awkwardly: “Can I take it home?”

Su Nantian waved his hand: “I’ve already ordered the manager to prepare another. You can take it home later.”

Zhang Xiaojun was stunned, then realized and felt embarrassed: “This is really… because my sister and I have never eaten…”

Su Nantian interrupted: “In the future, if you want anything, just come here.”

Zhang Xiaojun was stunned; a warm feeling passed through him.

“Now, what’s your decision? Will you work for me?” Su Nantian asked.

Zhang Xiaojun put down his chopsticks, adopting a serious expression: “At first, I thought you were just joking. But now I believe in you. I’ll ensure my sister lives well.”

Su Nantian nodded and added: “Then, after you finish eating, I’ll take you to ‘resign.’”

Zhang Xiaojun was stunned again. He had planned to go to the headquarters tomorrow, leaving this place—though it would be troublesome, he’d accept a beating. But Su Nantian wanted to take him directly to ‘resign.’

Chapter 181: Encounter

This made Zhang Xiaojun’s manly eyes well up. He hadn’t felt anyone’s care in a long time.

He stood solemnly and said: “Su Nantian, you value me; I’ll serve you without hesitation. I’ll obey your orders!”

After sending Zhang Mengyao off, they took another taxi.

Half an hour later, under Zhang Xiaojun’s guidance, the two arrived at a small bar in a back alley. Before entering, Su Nantian smelled the pungent alcohol scent.

Zhang Xiaojun felt embarrassed: “Because the boss likes bars, he opened this one. We report any issues here.”

Su Nantian nodded and stepped in, but instead of seeking his boss, he sat in a secluded corner.

Several beauties approached but were waved away by Su Nantian.

He watched the dancers in the club, their figures swaying under colorful lights. At this moment, they seemed real—fully releasing their inner desires.

Zhang Xiaojun sat silently beside him, not urging; he didn’t look elsewhere but stared intently at Su Nantian.

Suddenly, Su Nantian’s gaze sharpened—he spotted a familiar woman.

A woman was drinking at the bar, her tight dress outlining an alluring figure that drew men’s heated stares.

A tattooed man with a scar on his face finally couldn’t resist the silent temptation and approached with a vodka: “Hey, pretty lady, alone?”

The woman turned around, her mature beauty flushed with redness. Her eyes were hazy from drinking.

The scarred man reached out to touch her face, but she slapped his hand away with a fierce glare: “You, Zhu Ying’s auntie—can’t you touch this ugly bastard!”

The scarred man looked up, not angry but smiling. He licked his lips—such a fiery woman was rare. This stirred his inner desire.

His gaze at Zhu Ying was unmistakably hot.

“Hey, Miss Zhu Ying, you’re so fierce; I like it. Why are you alone here? Let me keep you company?” Before Zhu Ying could respond, the scarred man grabbed her shoulders and tried to lead her to a secluded corner.

Zhu Ying had an unlucky day, and the alcohol made her even more defiant against the scarred man’s advances.

Seeing Zhu Ying still refusing, he placed his other hand on her other shoulder, fully embracing her from behind.

Zhu Ying shivered and sobered up slightly, struggling to escape with increasing force.

“Let me go!” Zhu Ying kept wriggling, but the scarred man saw this as silent temptation.

“Let me go? You’re wriggling so happily?” The scarred man laughed, patting Zhu Ying’s firm buttocks.

Zhu Ying froze in shock, staring at the scarred man: “How dare you touch another person? I’ll call the police!”

The crowd laughed heartily, as if hearing the funniest joke in the world.

The bar’s lights flickered, making Zhu Ying’s silhouette appear somewhat indistinct in the dim light. Her angry expression was softened, resembling a young girl’s pout.

The scarred man didn’t fear Zhu Ying’s threat but smiled wider, his grip tightening without loosening.

Zhu Ying shouted for help, but her voice was drowned by the DJ’s loud music.

She desperately clung to a steel pipe-like decoration, making the scarred man unable to move. He smiled and bent down to lift her.

Zhu Ying was terrified, shrinking back but still not letting go of the pipe. She cried out: “Don’t come closer! Help!”

No one helped; instead, people pointed and gossiped.

Some men envied the scarred man—any woman he desired, he could have. They imagined it with excitement but could only dream; the scarred man was not someone they dared to provoke.

Some wanted to help but, seeing his fierce expression, chose to watch as bystanders.

This kind of incident was common in the bar; people had long become accustomed to it, as natural as eating and drinking.
