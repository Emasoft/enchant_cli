Su Nantian nodded after hearing this. In truth, he also agreed with Su Nan Tian's approach. One should not provoke others unless they provoke first; if provoked, one must eradicate the threat completely.

Those who survive in the business world must be decisive. They must avoid being fussy or indecisive. When others infringe upon you, one must retaliate immediately.

This was also a quality Su Nantian admired in Su Nan Tian—only men like this could achieve great things.

As they talked, the two arrived at Dihao Group's headquarters. Since Su Nan Tian and his group had come from the suburbs, they arrived later than Zhang Bao's team.

Zhang Bao led several men and dragged along Leng Zhifei. When he saw Su Nantian and Su Nantian step out of the car, he led Leng Zhifei over.

After all, this was Dihao Group's territory. Even though they had Leng Zhifei in their custody, they dared not appear openly at Dihao Group's entrance.

To put it bluntly, they were holding Leng Zhifei; Dihao Group's people were searching for him. To appear openly in front of their eyes would be foolish.

But now it was different. Seeing Su Nantian, Zhang Bao felt more confident and immediately led his men to meet Su Nantian.

"Big Brother, you've arrived. I've brought Leng Zhifei for you," Zhang Bao said, then patted his hands. His subordinates immediately dragged Leng Zhifei forward.

At this moment, although Leng Zhifei had not been tortured by Zhang Bao's group, after several days of detention, his mental state was poor. Being confined for so long was understandable.

Now Leng Zhifei could not even curse Su Nantian, his eyes losing all their sharpness.

"What happened to this kid? Did you mistreat him?" Su Nantian said mockingly, though he didn't care about these matters.

Zhang Bao smiled and replied, "Big Brother, we followed your orders and treated Leng Gongzi well. We didn't harm him at all. We provided good food and drink, and we stayed in the best hotel in Hangcheng with top service."

"Good, you did well," Su Nantian said. He approached Leng Zhifei and smiled, "Today I've brought you here to witness the history of Dihao Group. From today on, Dihao Group will no longer be under the Leng family."

After Su Nantian said this, Leng Zhifei, who had been somewhat listless, suddenly jolted. He widened his eyes and asked, "What did you say?"

Su Nantian smiled again and said, "I said from today on, Dihao Group will no longer be your family's asset. Alright, let him come over and see how I take over Dihao Group."

Su Nantian aimed to completely crush Leng Zhifei. His confidence had always stemmed from Dihao Group and Leng Boxiong, but now Leng Boxiong had handed over the entire Dihao Group to Su Nantian. From now on, he had no more reason for pride.

It must be said that Dihao Group's assets were vast. The entire twenty-story building in front of them belonged to Dihao Group.

When Su Nantian and his group tried to enter, they were blocked by the security guards at the entrance.

"Excuse me, what are you here for? Do you have an appointment? If you're a visitor, please register."

"Move aside. Don't block my Big Brother's way!" Zhang Bao immediately stepped forward and pushed the security guard aside.

"Alright, don't fight. This is his duty. He's very dedicated; he can stay," Su Nantian nodded, surprised that there was such a diligent person in Dihao Tower. He needed people like this. No matter who they were, if they blocked the way, they must follow procedures.

"I'm here to take over Dihao Group. The rest is none of your concern," Su Nantian said, then led his group upstairs.

The top floor was the chairman's office. However, Leng Boxiong was nowhere to be found—perhaps still sitting in the warehouse staring at the sky.

Su Nantian didn't care. He directly led his group to the top floor.

"Who are you? Why are you here? This is the chairman's exclusive office. Unauthorized people cannot enter."

A secretary-like man blocked Su Nantian and his group, and immediately noticed Leng Zhifei behind them.

"Master, why are you here? The chairman has been looking for you for a long time. Did they kidnap you? I'll call the police."

He said this and reached for his phone to dial. Zhang Bao immediately stepped forward, slapped the man's phone out of his hand and said, "You're a loyal servant of their family. But now Dihao Group has changed hands and is no longer the Leng family's asset. It will be taken over by my Big Brother. If you're wise, move aside!"

Su Nantian was quite pleased with Zhang Bao's servile behavior.

"What are you talking about? Dihao Group is the chairman's asset. How can you say it's taken over?"

Chapter 397: Convening a Meeting

"Correct. You could say Dihao Group was Leng Boxiong's asset before, but from today on it belongs to my Big Brother," Zhang Bao said immediately.

"Master, what's going on?" The man was very confused and asked Leng Zhifei.

"I don't believe it. Su Nantian, what proof do you have that Dihao Group is now yours?" Leng Zhifei immediately broke free from Zhang Bao's grip and approached Su Nantian.

"Ha, you ask me for proof. Then look at this—can it prove it?" Su Nantian said, then took out five equity transfer contracts from his briefcase. However, he didn't hand them over to Leng Zhifei but flipped through the transfer details in front of him.

"Does this look like Leng Boxiong's signature? Is this the Dihao Group's official seal? Five transfer contracts, 100% shares—all transferred to me."

Su Nantian waved his equity transfer documents and said calmly.

"I don't believe it! This must be fake. How could my father give Dihao Group's shares to you without reason? Even if you gave him more money, he wouldn't sell it!"

Leng Zhifei shouted loudly.

Su Nantian stepped forward and gently patted Leng Zhifei's face, saying, "You overthink it. Leng Boxiong didn't sell the shares to me; he transferred them to me. I spent no money at all. Don't you want to know why he transferred the shares to me?"

After hearing this, Leng Zhifei was stunned. Though he had some clues in his mind, he still didn't believe it.

"You... you said why..." Leng Zhifei stammered.

Su Nantian continued smiling and said, "Because of you. Because you're such a fool. That's why he bet with me. We had five matches, but he lost the first four completely. The fifth match he even forfeited. So all of Dihao Group's shares are now mine. Leng Boxiong was willing to lose everything for such a foolish son."

"Alright, move aside. I want to go into the chairman's office and take a look," Su Nantian said, then lifted his leg to enter the chairman's office.

"I don't believe it. This is fake. How do I know these so-called equity transfer documents are real? Until I see my father, I won't accept this!"

Leng Zhifei roared and blocked the entrance to the chairman's office, as if guarding it would prevent Dihao Group from falling into Su Nantian's hands.

"You and your father are truly alike. Each of you is the same," Su Nantian said, pointing at Song Lichen beside him and saying, "Do you know who this is? This is the witness of my match with Leng Boxiong."

"What's so special about a witness? How do I know you didn't just find someone to be your witness!" Leng Zhifei continued shouting.

"Do you know who this person is?" Su Nantian looked at Leng Zhifei's frenzied state and smiled.

Song Lichen also smiled at Leng Zhifei and said, "Hello, I am Song Lichen from the Jingdu Song family."

After Song Lichen introduced himself, Leng Zhifei was stunned. Even though Leng Zhifei was extravagant and incompetent, he had heard of the Jingdu Song family's name. He also didn't think anyone would dare to impersonate a member of the Jingdu Song family.

Moreover, this was a major event involving taking over an entire group. If it were fake, when exposed, the Jingdu Song family would certainly punish those who impersonated them severely.

"How about that? Now you finally believe, can you move aside?" Su Nantian said at this moment. Suddenly, he heard footsteps behind him.

Su Nantian turned around and saw Leng Boxiong leading a group of people approaching.

"Zhifei, are you alright? Did they mistreat you?" Leng Boxiong called out anxiously.

Leng Zhifei saw his father and immediately stepped aside to go towards him.

"Dad! Su Nantian said Dihao Group has been taken over by him. Is that true or not?" Leng Zhifei rushed to confirm with his father.

Leng Boxiong looked at Su Nantian and sighed deeply.

"It... it's true."

Leng Boxiong could only say helplessly. This matter was already decided; he had indeed lost the entire Dihao Group due to a bet.

"This is impossible! How could an entire Dihao Group be lost? I don't believe it! This must be fake!" Leng Zhifei shouted, then ran downstairs like a madman.

"Quickly chase after him. Don't let anything happen to him!" Leng Boxiong immediately ordered his bodyguards to chase after Leng Zhifei.

"Big Brother, should I bring this kid back?" Zhang Bao saw Leng Zhifei running away and immediately asked Su Nantian for instructions.

Su Nantian just waved his hand and said, "No need. After taking over Dihao Group, I was already planning to send him back. We have no reason to keep a useless person around. Let him go now; we still have more important matters."

After saying this, Su Nantian immediately turned to Leng Boxiong and said, "Alright, since you've arrived, I don't need to waste time. You quickly inform your subordinates and we'll proceed with the handover."

"Also, you are the administrative secretary, right? Now call all the managers here and we'll hold a meeting," Su Nantian said to the secretary.

This man, seeing that Leng Boxiong didn't object and hearing the conversation, knew Dihao Group had indeed changed hands. So he could only nod and follow Su Nantian's instructions to gather all the managers of Dihao Group in the meeting room for a meeting.

Su Nantian entered the conference room and without hesitation sat down in the chairman's seat. Leng Boxiong could only stand aside.

Everyone who entered the conference room was discussing, not knowing who this man was.

"Good day. Perhaps some of you don't know who I am, so I'll introduce myself first. My name is Su Nantian. From now on, I will be the chairman of Dihao Group. All shares of Dihao Group are now entirely in my hands. I should also thank your former chairman, Leng Boxiong, for transferring all his shares of Dihao Group to me."

Su Nantian directly told them the truth without any concealment.

After hearing this news, everyone in the room was stunned. Losing an entire group was unimaginable; it was like a huge gamble.

Chapter 398: A Display of Authority

"Chairman, is this true?" One person sitting below asked. They still didn't believe what Su Nantian said and wanted to confirm with Leng Boxiong.

Leng Boxiong nodded shamefully and said, "Yes. From today on, Dihao Group belongs to him. I am no longer your chairman."

After hearing this, Su Nantian raised his eyebrows and continued, "Alright, now you've heard it."

In fact, Leng Boxiong didn't want to cooperate with Su Nantian in holding this meeting, but he had nothing left and didn't want to offend the Jingdu Song family. So he could only cooperate with Su Nantian in holding this meeting.

After hearing Leng Boxiong's words, the people below fell silent. Some were silent because of this news, but others were calculating how they would survive the coming days.

A large group changing hands was not simple. Many things in the management might need to be replaced, which could also be an opportunity for advancement.

Su Nantian then knocked on the table with his hand and raised his eyebrows, saying, "I called you all here today for a reason."

As he spoke, Su Nantian observed the expressions of those below and continued, "I've already reviewed Dihao Group's financial reports. It has a loss of thirty million. The reason for this loss is among you. Who can tell me who did it? If your report is successful, I will promote you."

Every group's financial reports are released on time, so Su Nantian could easily see this data. However, he had his own insights about the loss. Many people said this was a normal operational loss, but Su Nantian knew there must be something fishy.

Cut the root and leave no trace; it was better to burn this weed while he had the chance as a new official.

The conference room fell silent again, and the atmosphere was压抑. Su Nantian knew his guess was correct; there must be someone behind this incident.

And this matter wasn't known by just one person. Many people knew about it, but they had covered it up before, so Leng Boxiong didn't know about these losses.

Even now that Leng Boxiong was no longer the chairman of Dihao Group, he couldn't believe his eyes as he looked at those sitting below.

Su Nantian looked down on Leng Boxiong, and no wonder Dihao Group lost money with such leadership.

"Alright, since none of you are willing to speak about this matter, I will fire all of you. I can't tolerate such things in my management."

Su Nantian said this, intending to clear some obstacles before handing the company over to Wen Ran.

After Su Nantian said this, one person immediately stood up and said, "I know! I know who caused this loss. But I can't say it in front of everyone, otherwise it would cause me trouble. I want to talk to you privately."

Su Nantian looked at this person and nodded, "Okay, come with me."

After saying this, Su Nantian immediately went out of the conference room, and this person who wanted to report others followed him.

The people remaining in the conference room were all on edge, as they didn't know who this person was going to report.

To be honest, many of Dihao Group's managers had some personal embezzlement. They still took some benefits, so when they heard this person wanted to report, they were all very nervous, fearing that the matter would be attributed to themselves.

"Chairman Su, I know who caused this loss," this person immediately said to Su Nantian. Unexpectedly, he had already adapted quickly and even changed his title.

"Good, tell me who caused this loss. If you're right, I'll promote you," Su Nantian said with his arms crossed and looked at this person.

"It's the head of the finance department. He made bad debts and fake accounts, causing us to lose so much money. You must investigate this matter carefully."

After saying this, he looked at Su Nantian with a triumphant expression, thinking his promotion was certain.

But Su Nantian didn't say much. He just nodded and said, "Alright, I know. Come in with me."

This reaction was beyond this person's expectations. He thought that since he was the first to report to Su Nantian, Su Nantian should reward him or at least praise him a bit. But Su Nantian's behavior made this person feel uneasy, unsure if his choice was correct.

After returning to the conference room, Su Nantian immediately sat down and said, "Alright, someone has already reported this to us. I already know who did it. Now I'll announce that I will fire..."

Su Nantian didn't continue speaking, instead his eyes roamed over everyone in the room.

The tension in the conference room had reached its peak.

Song Lichen sat beside Su Nantian, watching this scene with interest.

He hadn't expected that besides being skilled in combat, Su Nantian also had his own insights in this area. His methods were indeed very good.

After all, Song Lichen was a business expert himself. Now he naturally understood what Su Nantian was doing.

"I will fire the head of the logistics department," Su Nantian said coldly.

"What! Why am I being fired? Didn't I report the head of the finance department to you earlier?" The head of the logistics department was extremely surprised. He hadn't expected that after reporting the finance department's head, it turned out to be himself.

"Did you think I didn't know about your little tricks? Before this, I had already investigated who did it. It's not that you were careless and lost some goods, then bought them again but got cheated, losing over ten million. Then you decided to do it once and for all by buying some low-quality goods, passing them off as high quality, causing a total loss of thirty million."

Su Nantian explained how the money was lost in detail, as if he had witnessed it himself.

This head of logistics department sat stunned on his seat. He hadn't expected that the things he did were so clear to this person.

After all, even Leng Boxiong didn't know about this matter.

Chapter 399: New Official

"You just think I'm new here and don't know about the past. So you reported false information, but the finance department is an easy place to cause trouble. And it's the head of the finance department, right? I guess you two are enemies."

Su Nantian said while playing with his pen.

"Let me give you all a warning. Although I'm new to Dihao Group, I know everything about your past actions. Don't think of playing tricks; if you work diligently, I won't mistreat you. But if you try to play with me like him, your fate might be even worse."

After saying this, Su Nantian stood up and continued, "Alright, the meeting is over for now. I hope you all remember what I said."

"Also, Mr. Leng Boxiong, please hurry with the handover and take your belongings out of here."

Su Nantian said this to Leng Boxiong, then left the conference room with Song Lichen and Zhang Bao.

Zhang Bao watched Su Nantian's skills throughout, breaking out in a cold sweat. He thought his previous decision was indeed correct.

Zhang Bao thought about how since he followed Su Nantian, his momentum had risen. If he had opposed Su Nantian before, his fate would have been worse than Leng Boxiong's.

Zhang Bao also knew Leng Boxiong's strength. He and Leng Boxiong were evenly matched, but Leng Boxiong had a deeper foundation. Today he was so devastated by Su Nantian, and he truly felt his initial decision was correct.

After leaving Dihao Group Tower, Su Nantian stretched lazily and said to Song Lichen, "Song Lichen, you've been troubled these two days. When I need your help in the future, don't hesitate to ask me."

Song Lichen smiled while touching his crutch and said, "I should thank you. These two days were very interesting, and I felt like on vacation. If I really need your help in the future, I'll definitely ask. Alright, I won't stay in Hangcheng any longer; I'm leaving tonight. We'll meet again some other time."

People like Su Nantian and Song Lichen didn't need excessive small talk. They both knew each other's strengths and weaknesses, so they didn't need to say much.

After saying goodbye to Su Nantian, Song Lichen immediately got into his car. He needed to leave for Jingdu that night because the matters in Hangcheng were already over, and there was no need to stay. Staying was just for Su Nantian's sake.

Seeing Song Lichen's attitude towards Su Nantian, Zhang Bao was even more convinced of his initial decision. This Su Nantian had such a good relationship with the Jingdu Song family, and he hadn't been overconfident before. It was truly wise.

After sending off Song Lichen, Su Nantian didn't stay long and returned home. He knew Wen Ran was waiting for him.

As for Dihao Group, he didn't need to do anything today. Let the management figure it out themselves for a day and plan tomorrow.

When Su Nantian walked in, Wen Ran immediately rushed over and said, "Su Nantian, are you alright? Let me check if you're injured. I was so worried about you."

"I'm obviously fine, what could happen to me?" Su Nantian smiled and was about to indulge in a moment with Wen Ran when she pushed him away, whispering, "Don't do this. Wu You'er is here."

Hearing Wen Ran's words, Su Nantian noticed that there was also Wu You'er in the living room.

Wu You'er smiled and said, "Su Nantian, how did it go? Who won between you and Leng Boxiong?"

Wu You'er had also heard from Wen Ran about Su Nantian's match with Leng Boxiong. He had great confidence in Su Nantian, so he was eager to know the result.

Su Nantian smiled and said, "Do you think I won?"

"Probably. But I think Leng Boxiong would try to cheat. Would he really give up the entire Dihao Group for you?" Wu You'er thought for a moment and said.

"Look at this," Su Nantian said, taking out the five equity transfer contracts from his briefcase.

"Wow, Su Nantian, you really did it. Dihao Group is now yours," Wu You'er exclaimed in surprise. This was too incredible; if this were true, Leng Boxiong had lost everything and had nothing left to fight with Su Nantian.

"Actually, Dihao Group isn't mine. It's Wen Ran's. I had already promised her that after winning Dihao Group, I would let her be the chairman. So in a few days, I'll transfer the shares to her again. But for now, I'll go there first and help him tidy up Dihao Group's situation. When she takes over as chairman, the people below will all obey her."

Wen Ran hadn't expected that Su Nantian's words were true. To give such a big company to herself like this was unimaginable.

Perhaps for others, Dihao Group was a huge asset. But for Su Nantian, compared to its vast assets, Dihao Group was nothing. He had bet with Leng Boxiong because the entire Leng family had annoyed him.

Moreover, Leng Boxiong had also annoyed his beloved woman. How could Su Nantian let his woman be bullied without reason? He had to show them a lesson.

Since Dihao Group was Leng Boxiong's lifeblood, Su Nantian would uproot it completely and leave Leng Boxiong no chance to recover.

This massive industry wasn't something that could be rebuilt overnight. Especially for someone like Leng Boxiong, with a son like Leng Zhifei, it would be very difficult to start over.

Now in Hangcheng, Su Nantian had become a local legend. Not only did he take over the city's top enterprise, but he also subdued Zhang Bao, a local boss. It seemed there was nothing in Hangcheng that could rival him.

But for Su Nantian, the matter wasn't over. He was still waiting; he might need to subdue another force for himself.

Yes, it's the secret organization. Su Nantian felt that if he could have such an organization, it would be twice as effective for him in the future.

After all, Su Nantian couldn't go everywhere and subdue a force. But if he could have the secret organization, they had their own eyes nationwide. If he could use them, it would be good to cultivate a small force secretly.

Chapter 400: The Secret Organization's Visit

The next day, when Su Nantian came to Dihao Group again, everyone from top to bottom greeted him respectfully as "Chairman" upon seeing him.

Because not only had the entire Dihao Group changed hands, but everyone in Hangcheng's business circles already knew about it.

After a night of discussion, Wen Ran didn't want Su Nantian's shares. She said if Su Nantian really wanted her to take over Dihao Group, she could act as the president publicly while Su Nantian still held the largest shareholder.

After hearing Wen Ran's words, Su Nantian was deeply moved. He knew Wen Ran truly loved him; otherwise, she wouldn't have done this.

Many women in the world value money and power. They don't care about how men are, but he knew Wen Ran wasn't like that. The two of them were truly in love.

And this was even more evident from the Dihao Group incident.

After arriving at Dihao Group, Su Nantian held an emergency meeting because he was the sole shareholder with 100% shares, so the timing of the meeting was entirely up to him.

"Alright, after a night's thinking, I'm sure you all know how Dihao Group will continue operating. Today I want to announce an important matter."

Su Nantian patted Wen Ran's shoulder and smiled, "From now on, I won't be personally responsible for Dihao Group's operations. However, Wen Ran will serve as your president and manage all of Dihao Group's affairs. I hope you don't play tricks or have any thoughts, because your every move is under my surveillance."

Su Nantian's tone was unquestionable and full of confidence.

In fact, this speech was to pave the way for Wen Ran. He felt that if he wasn't there, leaving Wen Ran here would make the people below definitely try tricks. But after his intimidation, they would be more careful and think twice before acting, considering the consequences if discovered.

"Don't look at Wen Ran as a girl and play tricks. Dihao Group is transparent; don't think you can hide anything like before. However, I'll say this: reward those who do well and punish those with ulterior motives."

After saying this, Su Nantian left. The rest of the time would be for Wen Ran alone.

Wen Ran had previously suggested this idea herself. It was good that Su Nantian intimidated them before, but since Wen Ran would eventually be in charge of Dihao Group's operations, she needed to personally interact with the management.

Su Nantian also felt he couldn't constantly protect Wen Ran, especially in Dihao Group. If Wen Ran was to become president, she had to independently deal with them.

After leaving, Su Nantian didn't hang around. He still had his own matters to attend to.

Earlier, Su Nantian sat in the chairman's office chair and closed his eyes as if waiting for something.

After a while, someone knocked on the office door. "Chairman, there are people from the secret organization who claim to be here to see you."

After hearing this, Su Nantian's lips slightly curled. He thought he had finally arrived.

In fact, Su Nantian already knew the secret organization would come to him because Master Yào's illness still needed Su Nantian's treatment. The secret organization would come no matter what.

But Su Nantian's goal was not just this. In short, he wanted to subdue the secret organization for his own use; this force was important to him.

"Let them come up," After receiving Su Nantian's reply, the secretary outside immediately invited the secret organization people in.

"Mr. Su, we've come. Please save Master Yào for us."

In fact, after they returned yesterday, Master Yào had also tried to treat his own strange condition. But he found that no matter what method he used, he couldn't get better.

Master Yào was the most skilled in medicine within the secret organization. If he couldn't heal himself, no one could help him.

So they had to come and ask Su Nantian to treat Master Yào. Also, yesterday Su Nantian had told them that if they wanted to treat Master Yào, they should come to Dihao Group today.

So the secret organization people came as scheduled.

Su Nantian looked at Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yeyu standing before him. He knew these two were the core of the secret organization.

Su Nantian stood up and walked between them, saying, "Saving Master Yào for you isn't impossible. After all, I gave that injection yesterday, so I know how to neutralize it. However, I think we can also talk about cooperation."

Su Nantian had made his intention clear. Now it was up to Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yeyu to decide.

After hearing Su Nantian's words, the two of them were stunned. They hadn't expected Su Nantian to say this.

In fact, on that day at the arena, Su Nantian had told them to come to Dihao Group in two days. At that time, they already knew Su Nantian had intended to subdue them as his underlings.

So they came today, not only for Master Yào's treatment but also because they had already decided to submit to Su Nantian.

But now this scene made the two of them hesitant. Su Nantian had said he wanted to be brothers with them.

"Are you two unwilling?" Su Nantian said while walking up and patting their shoulders.

"No... it's not unwilling. I just didn't expect you to want to be brothers with us," Qi Yinzhen answered honestly, as he hadn't expected Su Nantian to make such a decision.

"Hahahaha. I, Su Nantian, can see who is suitable to be a brother and who is only fit to be an underling. You two are suitable for brothers. I also know who can't be a brother but only an underling. You aren't that kind of people."

Chapter 401: Medicine Powder

After hearing Su Nantian's words, Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yeyu were stunned.

They hadn't expected Su Nantian to say this. On that day at the arena, Su Nantian had told them to come to Dihao Group in two days. At that time, they already knew Su Nantian had intended to subdue them as his underlings.

So they came today, not only for Master Yào's treatment but also because they had already decided to submit to Su Nantian.

But now this scene made the two of them hesitant. Su Nantian had said he wanted to be brothers with them.

"Are you two unwilling?"

Su Nantian said while walking up and patting their shoulders.

"No... it's not unwilling. I just didn't expect you to want to be brothers with us," Qi Yinzhen answered honestly, as he hadn't expected Su Nantian to make such a decision.

"Hahahaha. I, Su Nantian, can see who is suitable to be a brother and who is only fit to be an underling. You two are suitable for brothers. I also know who can't be a brother but only an underling. You aren't that kind of people."
