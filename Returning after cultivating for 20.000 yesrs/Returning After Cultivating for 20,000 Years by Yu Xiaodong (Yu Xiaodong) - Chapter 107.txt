“Tao is indeed a minor leader among them. Su Nantian could immediately tell that he was the most skilled in this group, and it seemed he had learned martial arts.”

Su Nantian directly charged at one of the men with the most imposing physique. To others, this choice seemed unwise—had he wanted to break through, he should have targeted the slimmest opponent and taken them down. Choosing this bulky man would only lead to entanglement.

Yet Su Nantian saw things differently. This man had ranked among the top hundred due to his immense strength, but he was lacking in all other aspects. Su Nantian had recognized this flaw—his lower body was particularly weak, and if he attacked it, he could take him down swiftly.

However, after launching his attack, Su Nantian found it even faster than expected. He had merely kicked the man’s leg, yet the opponent immediately clutched it and howled in pain before collapsing.

This created an opening, and Su Nantian immediately quickened his pace to circle around several opponents. With a single strike, he knocked them all unconscious, just like the small one he had previously felled.

In this manner, nine men were reduced to four within less than three minutes. The onlookers were stunned; their mouths hung open in disbelief, unable to comprehend how Su Nantian possessed such strength.

“Be careful—he moves quickly and is strong. He’s definitely a martial artist,” Tao said, as he himself was a former Buddhist monk and recognized Su Nantian’s movements.

Yet Su Nantian’s combat skills were fluid, drawing from various schools without a fixed pattern.

Tao felt an eerie familiarity but could not pinpoint the exact style.

Su Nantian glanced at the remaining few and smiled, saying, “You see how fast this is? If we fought in a wheel battle, it would take longer and waste words. It’s better to strike swiftly. You four should stop hesitating and come at me.”

As he spoke, Su Nantian beckoned them forward.

“Two of you—distract his upper and lower body. Once you’ve pinned him, deliver a fatal strike.”

Tao had resolved to fight now; he hadn’t expected his group to be reduced so quickly. If they were defeated, bringing Su Nantian to the higher-ups of Haiwang Gang would only humiliate him. He could not allow Su Nantian to win here.

Chapter 528: Yuan Daying

At that moment, in the courtyard behind the building where Su Nantian and his opponents were fighting, a man stood by the glass window watching.

“Who is this person? Why did Hong Tao bring him back?” a middle-aged man in his forties asked.

“He’s one of the new bodyguards from the Nangong family. Today, Liu Qiao and his group went to collect money but were beaten. According to our usual methods, we handled the Wang family in the same way. But I didn’t expect Hong Tao to follow this man’s request and fight a wheel battle with him. It would have been better to act as before.”

The man speaking wore round-rimmed glasses, giving him a scholarly appearance.

“But it’s quite interesting—this person’s skills are remarkable. If we could recruit him, he’d be a valuable asset for Haiwang Gang. Go down and tell Hong Tao to stop the fight and bring him up.”

Huo Zun was surprised upon hearing this. It was the first time Yuan Daying had ever spared someone who should have been eliminated by Haiwang Gang.

“Boss, are you sure? I don’t think this person is easy to control. We might end up losing profit and causing trouble.” Huo Zun pushed his glasses up, saying this with concern. He felt this person was too unusual and should be dealt with early to avoid becoming an enemy, as he seemed impossible to subdue.

“You listen to me. Bring him up for a meeting. If he’s truly unmanageable, we’ll proceed as usual. Haiwang Gang is desperately short of manpower now; we can’t stay confined to Ruo Hai District forever. Also, you see these major families are clearly changing the status quo. We need to keep our options open.”

After saying this, Yuan Daying waved his hand, signaling Huo Zun to act.

“Alright, I understand. I’ll bring him up myself.” Huo Zun then turned and left the room, heading downstairs.

At this moment, Su Nantian was still facing Hong Tao and his group. He wanted to strike immediately but found them all wary, searching for an opening.

Yet Su Nantian’s defense was impenetrable; finding a flaw was nearly impossible.

Suddenly, someone shouted, “Enough—stop! The boss told me to bring him up.”

The voice was familiar. Hong Tao instinctively turned and saw it was Huo Zun.

“Is this the boss’s command?” Hong Tao asked, confused.

“Yes, the boss just said so. He’s interested in this person.”

After saying that, Huo Zun turned to Su Nantian and asked, “How about coming with me?”

“Will meeting the boss of Haiwang Gang be worth it?” Su Nantian scrutinized the man before him.

Su Nantian could tell this person had no martial arts skills at all. Such a man speaking in Haiwang Gang was likely a strategist.

“Yes, and it’s the boss himself who ordered you to come up. Will you come with me?”

Hearing this, Su Nantian nodded. “If that’s the case, of course I’ll go with you. That’s why I came here—to meet the boss of Haiwang Gang.”

Huo Zun smiled upon hearing this and turned to leave. Su Nantian followed him, and none of the surrounding men dared to block them.

After Su Nantian left, Hong Tao’s companions said, “What’s going on, Tao? Why did the boss call him up?”

“Who knows? I don’t know what this kid is planning. Alright, you all clean up and carry them out to check if they’re injured. If not, let them rest; if so, call a doctor.”

Hong Tao’s shift was quick. Just moments ago, he had been ready to fight, but now he ordered his men to clean up the mess. After all, it was the boss’s command; even if he opposed, it would be useless.

And since the boss had called Su Nantian up, there must be something to discuss with him.

Su Nantian followed the man upstairs. The building was eerily quiet, and he had expected it to be guarded by many subordinates. Instead, the path was empty of people.

He entered an office with the man and found a middle-aged man seated inside.

“This is our boss,” Huo Zun told Su Nantian.

Su Nantian nodded and said, “Hello, I’m Nantian.”

The middle-aged man nodded and smiled. “I heard you were looking for me. What do you need?”

Su Nantian smiled and said, “I’m a bodyguard for the Nangong family. I heard Haiwang Gang has been harassing the Nangong family here. I came to ask if you could stop this harassment. Also, since the Nangong family has given you money for years, can we clear the debt from now on?”

This was indeed Su Nantian’s original goal—resolving this matter would allow him to return to the Nangong family quickly. However, his interest in Haiwang Gang had grown even more than before.

Moreover, he now felt Haiwang Gang was different from what he had imagined, increasing his interest.

“Originally, you came here for this?” Yuan Daying didn’t believe the man had come just for such a trivial matter. He could fight with Hong Tao and many others, so it couldn’t be just about the Nangong family’s money.

“Of course. I’m also very curious and interested in Haiwang Gang. You control this place without any oversight, ruling it like a king. And your rules are all decided by fists—true?”

Su Nantian smiled as he spoke, watching the middle-aged man. He could see his sharp gaze—clearly a product of years in this world.

Yuan Daying smiled, “What are our rules? You’ve already fought with them; you should know what they are. It’s not like I didn’t notice your skills—otherwise, I would have had them kill you. You wouldn’t be standing before me now.”

Chapter 529: Conditions

After Yuan Daying said this, he suddenly told Su Nantian, “No matter why you came, if what you said is true and you want the Nangong family to stop paying us forever, I can agree—but I have a condition.”

Su Nantian hadn’t expected Yuan Daying to accept so readily, but he was curious about what condition could make Haiwang Gang stop harassing the Nangong family.

“Speak up. If I can do it, I will.” Su Nantian thought the condition was not simple but perhaps he could complete it.

“Since you don’t want us to ask the Nangong family for money, we need some business to survive. However, our recent business was stolen. If you can help us reclaim it, I’ll definitely agree to your request,” Yuan Daying said with a smile and looked at Su Nantian.

Su Nantian had known from Song Lichen’s information that Haiwang Gang had other industries outside Ruo Hai District.

After all, Ruo Hai was entirely controlled by Haiwang Gang; it couldn’t have normal commercial activities like outside. Thus, they used Ruo Hai as a base but made money mainly in other cities.

He could guess what these industries were, but if Su Nantian could reclaim one of them, he could complete the task assigned by the Nangong family. It wasn’t impossible.

After thinking for a while, Su Nantian replied, “Okay, if I can help you reclaim this industry, will you truly stop harassing the Nangong family forever?”

Yuan Daying nodded. “A word spoken is a promise. As long as you help us reclaim the industry, the Nangong family can withdraw from Ruo Hai District. We’ll be clear with each other, and we won’t contact the Nangong family again. I Yuan Daying keep my word.”

“Then, I can help you,” Su Nantian nodded and accepted.

“If that’s the case, you can go back today. I’ll send someone to fetch you tomorrow,” Yuan Daying waved his hand, signaling Huo Zun to let Su Nantian leave.

Thus, Su Nantian was escorted out by Huo Zun and given a car to return.

When Su Nantian reached the square, everyone stared at him again. They were all surprised—why had this man escaped unscathed? They had thought he would be severely beaten, but now Su Nantian was completely unharmed.

Huo Zun also personally escorted Su Nantian to the car and said, “You can go back now. Prepare yourself; tomorrow might be a fierce battle. We’ll send someone to fetch you.”

After saying this, Huo Zun signaled the man to take Su Nantian back.

When Su Nantian returned to his house in Ruo Hai District, he heard voices inside. The sound was clearly Wang Dashan and his group.

Wang Dashan said, “This kid should never return. He was so arrogant to attack Haiwang Gang’s people. It was really overconfident.”

“Still, it was his own fault. But this made Chao Ge happy. I didn’t expect this kid to die on his own.” Liu Miao said, then smiled.

Su Nantian couldn’t help but smile. He hadn’t expected Chao Ge to send him here just to torment him, yet he also hoped for his death.

“What are you all talking about? It’s so lively.” Su Nantian said as he entered the house.

Wang Dashan and his group immediately stood up from their seats, stunned.

“You… you… how did you come back?” Wang Dashan asked in disbelief.

“Why shouldn’t I return? Didn’t I have the right to come back?” Su Nantian asked, as if confused.

“How could you return? You were taken by Haiwang Gang’s people, right? They didn’t do anything to you?” Wang Dashan asked again and examined Su Nantian’s body but found no wounds. His appearance showed he hadn’t been tortured at all.

“Oh, you mean Haiwang Gang’s people? Nothing much—just had a chat and came back. Do you really hope I don’t return or that Haiwang Gang does something to me?”

Su Nantian said this and stared at Wang Dashan.

Wang Dashan quickly waved his hands, “Of course not! We definitely hope you return safely. But you know Haiwang Gang is the dominant force here. People taken by them never have a good end. So your safe return shocked us. But since you’re back, we’re relieved and happy.”

Wang Dashan was a master of saying the right thing to people. He immediately changed his attitude in front of Su Nantian. Earlier, he had seemed delighted that Su Nantian was taken by Haiwang Gang, but now he quickly showed loyalty and welcomed him back.

Su Nantian knew exactly what Wang Dashan was thinking, but he didn’t care. People like Wang Dashan weren’t worth his effort.

Even if he beat Wang Dashan up, it wouldn’t affect him at all.

So Su Nantian just smiled and said, “By the way, I came here but haven’t asked yet. Where can I rest? I’m a bit tired and want to sleep.”

“There’s a dormitory upstairs. I’ll take you there,” Wang Dashan immediately said and led Su Nantian up to rest.

Wang Dashan and his group lived in a dormitory, but now Su Nantian’s presence made the beds insufficient. Fortunately, there was an empty room nearby. They quickly set up a spring bed and laid some blankets and quilts, making it ready.

Su Nantian smiled and patted Wang Dashan’s shoulder, saying, “Thanks for your trouble. But now you have one more thing to do.”

“You command it, and I’ll definitely do it,” Wang Dashan immediately patted his chest.

“It’s not a big deal. Just call Chao Ge and tell him I returned safely, no problems. I feel sorry for him.” Su Nantian said with a teasing tone.

Chapter 530: Call

Wang Dashan heard Su Nantian’s words and looked distressed, his face pale. “Nantian Brother, don’t torment me anymore. I can’t bear the guilt of both you and Chao Ge. You two settle it yourselves; we won’t interfere.”

Wang Dashan said this and stood up from his seat, preparing to leave. He also quickly waved his hands for his companions to follow him out. But before he took two steps, Su Nantian grabbed his neck and pulled him back to the chair.

“You all were laughing so happily before, but now it’s just me and Chao Ge involved. You weren’t playing around so happily in the middle, but now you want me to call Chao Ge. Shouldn’t that make you even happier?”

Upon hearing Su Nantian’s words, Wang Dashan’s face turned green and then red. He hadn’t expected his group’s conversation had been completely overheard by Su Nantian.

“Nantian Brother, I’m sorry! I was wrong! I really was wrong! All of us thought you were taken by Haiwang Gang and would be in trouble. I didn’t expect you to escape from Haiwang Gang’s people with good fortune.” Wang Dashan said, looking at Su Nantian with a pitiful expression.

“I won’t trouble you. Just take out your phone now and call Chao Ge to tell him his wish didn’t come true, and I was sent back by Haiwang Gang.” Su Nantian said with a teasing smile.

“Okay, I’ll call. I’ll go back to the dorm and call.” Wang Dashan said this and wanted to leave, but as he stood up, Su Nantian pressed his shoulder down, preventing him from moving.

“Call now, right here. Take out your phone and put it on speaker for Chao Ge.”

Su Nantian’s tone left no room for negotiation. Wang Dashan realized he couldn’t escape today and nodded resignedly, then took out his phone from his pocket.

Wang Dashan placed the phone on the table and dialed Chao Ge’s number, pressing speaker.

Chao Ge seemed to have been waiting for this call. He was eager to hear the news he wanted from Wang Dashan.

The phone was quickly answered, and Chao Ge’s tone clearly showed excitement: “Wang Dashan, did you call with good news? Did Haiwang Gang finish off that kid? I thought he was just going to let him see the world, beat him up and bring him back. But he went and provoked Haiwang Gang’s people. Now that it’s like this, I can’t blame myself.”

Chao Ge said these words with great pride. Su Nantian could clearly hear his satisfaction in the tone.

Upon hearing Chao Ge’s words, Wang Dashan’s face was like a bitter gourd. He turned to look at Su Nantian’s expression.

At this moment, Su Nantian had no expression on his face, which made Wang Dashan extremely afraid. If Su Nantian showed anger, Wang Dashan would find it normal. But now Su Nantian was eerily calm, which made Wang Dashan feel a chill.

Su Nantian waved his hand to signal Wang Dashan to talk with Chao Ge, so Wang Dashan could only nod reluctantly.

“Uncle Chao, this is Wang Dashan… tonight…”

Before Wang Dashan could finish, Chao Ge continued: “I know. It’s about that kid being finished by Haiwang Gang, right?”

“No… Uncle Chao, let me finish…”

Upon hearing Wang Dashan’s words, Chao Ge clearly felt something was wrong. He had expected Wang Dashan to bring him the long-awaited good news, but instead, the call was hesitant. This suggested something had changed.

“Tell me what happened quickly. Don’t be hesitant. Has the situation changed?” Chao Ge’s expression turned serious, and his previous cheerful demeanor immediately became terrifying.

“Tao Ge, this is… today, the kid was indeed taken by Haiwang Gang’s people. We also thought it would be like the previous fight with the Wang family against Haiwang Gang. But… but… the result was different. The kid returned completely unharmed.”

Wang Dashan said this while looking back at Su Nantian, who nodded in approval.

At this moment, Wang Dashan felt like crying. He couldn’t understand why these people wanted to force him to call Chao Ge.

Wang Dashan thought if he were Su Nantian, he wouldn’t have told Chao Ge the news. Clearly, Chao Ge was hoping for him to be killed by Haiwang Gang’s people. Since he had escaped, why tell Chao Ge? If Chao Ge knew, he might use some means to trap him.

“Wait… what? Unharmed? You mean the kid returned unharmed from Haiwang Gang’s hands? Are you joking with me? That’s Haiwang Gang!”

Chao Ge heard Wang Dashan’s news and clearly didn’t believe it. He couldn’t imagine anyone escaping from Haiwang Gang alive, especially Su Nantian who had provoked them. Just like the Wang family before him.

The Wang family, if he remembered correctly, had all been killed by Haiwang Gang’s people. And the Wang family still dared to be angry but couldn’t speak out, because they knew Haiwang Gang was the emperor in Ruo Hai District.

This incident showed how unusual it was. Even people with Wang family’s temper had to endure Haiwang Gang, but Su Nantian who provoked them returned unharmed and according to Wang Dashan’s words, completely intact.

“I don’t believe it. Impossible! Has Haiwang Gang changed? Why would they let him go? This kid didn’t offend them, right? Now immediately send me a photo. Don’t let him find out, secretly.”

Chao Ge thought it over and decided he needed to see for himself. Wang Dashan’s call didn’t convince him that Su Nantian could escape from Haiwang Gang alive, so he made this request.

Chapter 531: Intentional

Upon hearing Chao Ge’s demand, Wang Dashan almost broke down. Now Su Nantian was right next to him; how could he take a photo?

So Wang Dashan only turned back and looked at Su Nantian with an expression of helplessness, waiting for his instructions.

At this moment, Su Nantian smiled and took Wang Dashan’s phone himself.

Wang Dashan was shocked but didn’t dare to speak. Su Nantian smiled and said into the phone, “Uncle Chao, it’s Nantian. You wanted to see if I was injured or not? I’m calling you myself now, and I’m fine. Haiwang Gang’s people didn’t do anything to me. You can rest easy.”

Chao Ge on the other end was stunned. He hadn’t expected Su Nantian to call him directly, and his voice was clearly Nantian’s.

Chao Ge suddenly understood something and said coldly, “It seems you’ve already made them submit. Wang Dashan wouldn’t resist either. You intentionally had Wang Dashan call me to provoke me, right?”

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian was a bit surprised. He hadn’t expected Chao Ge to be so sharp-minded. Their previous interactions had only been physical, and they hadn’t exchanged minds before. But now Chao Ge was clearly a man of many facets.

But Su Nantian thought about it, and those who had come up with such a plan to send him to Ruo Hai District must have a sharp mind.

“Since Uncle Chao knows, I’ll be straightforward. You’ve always hoped for me to be finished by Haiwang Gang’s people. I can only say sorry, and I’ve disappointed you.” Su Nantian said this with no other reason but to provoke Chao Ge.

Su Nantian didn’t understand why he and Chao Ge had no real grudge, but when they sparred, Su Nantian had been too harsh and taken Chao Ge’s title of first bodyguard in the Nangong family. This was enough for Chao Ge to hate him and even wish for his death, which Su Nantian found confusing.

Chao Ge on the other end was also firm in his response: “You can escape for now, but not forever. To live safely on Haiwang Gang’s territory, you must be like Wang Dashan and his group. But with your personality, that’s impossible. Anyway, enjoy it there. I won’t let the old man call you back early. Even if the master himself comes to ask, I’ll find a way to refuse him.”

After saying this, Chao Ge hung up the phone. Su Nantian smiled helplessly; it seemed Chao Ge was really upset.

Moreover, Chao Ge’s words confirmed Su Nantian’s initial concerns. He wanted to finish the matter with Haiwang Gang quickly so he could return to the Nangong family. But now, his main goal was to rescue Wu You’er and Wu Tao’s couple.

He had to return to Ruo Hai District as quickly as possible, and he needed to continue using the Nangong family’s identity to interact with the Wu family. Only then could he be sure of rescuing them both. If he left the Nangong family’s identity, it would be difficult to interact with the Wu family.

Although Su Nantian was close to Song Lichen, he couldn’t use the head family’s identity to communicate with the Wu family. After all, Song Lichen currently managed the branch of the Song family. And if he stayed with Song Lichen, even if he could communicate with the Wu family, it would also involve Song Lichen.

So after thinking carefully, Su Nantian decided to stay with the Nangong family was safer. Plus, Nangong Yuyan had just successfully collaborated with Wu Chuan, and the two families were now closest. He could use his identity as a bodyguard of the Nangong family to communicate with the Wu family, which was legitimate.

However, the most direct way for Su Nantian to resolve the situation with the Nangong family in Haiwang Gang was to go with Yuan Daying and his group tomorrow.

Upon thinking of this, Su Nantian felt he should rest well tonight to prepare himself for the battle. So he placed Wang Dashan’s phone on the table and walked upstairs.

Before going up, Su Nantian turned back to Wang Dashan and said, “Alright, I’m going to sleep. You all just do whatever.”

After Su Nantian went upstairs, the group finally sighed in relief. They knew Su Nantian’s strength. Wang Dashan had thought that because of Chao Ge, Su Nantian might become angry and involve them all. But instead, Su Nantian’s emotions were unusually stable, and he had already left to rest.

Wang Dashan confirmed Su Nantian had truly left and then patted his chest, sighing deeply: “This was really hard. Being between Uncle Chao and Nantian Brother is truly being in a difficult spot. Fortunately, nothing happened today, and we escaped this time.”

Seeing Wang Dashan’s expression, the others quickly gathered around and whispered: “Dashan, what’s going on with Haiwang Gang? They’ve never been so gentle before. How come they let this kid go?”

They were all confused about what was happening with Haiwang Gang. In their minds, Haiwang Gang had always been ruthless and violent, and the key to determining strength was their fists.

Moreover, because of the Wang family’s previous example, they clearly understood what happened to those who resisted Haiwang Gang. And the Wang family had more people than Su Nantian, but they were all gone without a trace. Although no one told them where those people went, they all knew what had happened to the Wang family.

“This I don’t know. I’m not a蛔虫 inside Haiwang Gang. But this group of people is definitely strange. They usually fight and kill, but this time they let Nantian go unharmed.”

Wang Dashan said this while anxiously watching the staircase, fearing that if he spoke too much, Su Nantian would appear again and he’d suffer another beating.

“I saw that Haiwang Gang’s people drove him back, so this kid must have joined Haiwang Gang,” Liu Miao said. When Su Nantian entered, he had looked out the window and seen Haiwang Gang’s car leaving. It seemed Su Nantian must have taken that car back.

Chapter 532: Exclusive

While Wang Dashan and his group were discussing Su Nantian’s relationship with Haiwang Gang, Su Nantian returned to his room and immediately took out his phone to check his email.

He had previously asked Song Lichen to investigate Haiwang Gang’s industries outside and any recent disturbances.

In fact, Su Nantian was already setting up his information network but had only entrusted Song Lichen with this task since he was more familiar with the capital. He thought it was better to rely on him, and he had already owed Song Lichen more than one favor.

Moreover, this matter was personal for Su Nantian; he couldn’t use the Dragon Group’s resources to investigate these things.

After thinking it over, Song Lichen was the most suitable person for this task. And Song Lichen had already prepared thoroughly, ready to mobilize all his resources once Su Nantian contacted him. It wasn’t a big deal for him.

Additionally, this kind of information investigation was something Song Lichen did regularly. His ability to manage the branch industries of the Song family so thoroughly was due to his extensive information network.

Song Lichen always investigated every detail of a matter, including everyone involved and the entire background.

Upon seeing Song Lichen’s message, Su Nantian couldn’t help but admire how many industries Haiwang Gang had outside. Most were places of indulgence, fitting their background.

He noticed one industry in particular had recently encountered some minor troubles, but on the surface it seemed trivial. He couldn’t know what was happening behind the scenes.

So Su Nantian focused on this one—Haiwang Gang’s bar had recently clashed with another group. These people were also running bars nearby, making Su Nantian suspect they were both underground organizations with their own networks.

“Looks like it’s these people. Two gangs must have had a conflict,” Su Nantian muttered after reviewing the data.

If things were as simple as he thought, then Su Nantian only needed to help Haiwang Gang deal with them. It wouldn’t be too complicated.

But Su Nantian knew things weren’t that ideal. He had confirmed this after meeting Yuan Daying. If it were just a physical fight, Yuan Daying would have sent his subordinates to handle it.

Yuan Daying wouldn’t have made this a condition for Su Nantian to complete, especially since the exchange was about the Nangong family’s freedom in Ruo Hai District. From now on, Haiwang Gang would no longer charge the Nangong family any fees.

This was a loss for Haiwang Gang, and if it were just physical labor to exchange, it would be too kind.

Moreover, Song Lichen’s investigation was thorough but not deep. After all, he wasn’t familiar with Ruo Hai District and could only gather limited information. The data he had today was mostly obtained indirectly.

For instance, the conflict with another group was discovered through a third party by Song Lichen’s subordinates.

Because Haiwang Gang ruled Ruo Hai District alone, investigating them was almost impossible unless they could plant someone as a spy. But going undercover in Haiwang Gang had no value.

After reviewing all of Song Lichen’s information, Su Nantian confirmed there was no more useful data. He turned off his phone and prepared for rest, knowing he needed to be at his peak to face the battle tomorrow.

It was undeniable that Wang Dashan and his group were quite observant; they got up early the next morning to prepare breakfast for Su Nantian.

But as Su Nantian was eating, he suddenly heard the sound of engines and saw a large number of cars approaching.

Wang Dashan and his group immediately stood up, looking outside to see a crowd of cars heading their way.

“What’s going on? All are Haiwang Gang’s cars,” Liu Miao said in disbelief. They all felt like running away, not expecting Haiwang Gang’s people to come toward them.

At this moment, Liu Zhiping pointed at Su Nantian sitting and eating breakfast and whispered to the others: “Could it be for him? This is what they didn’t settle yesterday and are coming to settle today?”
