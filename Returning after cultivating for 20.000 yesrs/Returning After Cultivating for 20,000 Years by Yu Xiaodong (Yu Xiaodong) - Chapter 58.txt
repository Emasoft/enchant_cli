The golden liquid gradually solidified into form, outlining a talisman array before being embedded within it. This was the purpose of these twelve Do Tian Shen Sha swords, primarily used for arranging formations.

Thus, the refining method differed slightly from Fu Yun's, yet it was essentially similar. For Su Nantian, this was effortless.

The golden flying sword gradually took shape, causing the three people in the monitoring room to gape in astonishment.

Chapter 277: Awakening the Do Tian Shen Sha

In their perception, a divine sword was priceless and unattainable. Who could have imagined that within this small secret chamber, Su Nantian had simply and effortlessly crafted it in a short time?

The Geng Jin Sword, primarily for cutting and killing, was shaped like a broad sword with a palm-width blade and an over-30-centimeter hilt. Its total length exceeded one meter and twenty centimeters, but the material for this divine sword was insufficient. Su Nantian had no choice but to add some Xuan Tie.

Though Xuan Tie was somewhat low-grade, it was the only material Su Nantian had at hand. Moreover, since the Twelve Shen Sha Sword Array mainly carried demonic energy, as long as the design was sufficient, even inferior materials could naturally grow. Thus, this weapon was a growth-type one.

However, when Su Nantian added Xuan Tie, the action made them all feel a pang of regret. All of Su Nantian's Xuan Tie had been refined into the Black Iron Throne, and at this moment, he had no qualms about destroying it. He simply took out the Iron Throne, snapped off a chair leg, and plucked two skull heads.

Zhang An was heartbroken. He had suffered considerable losses under this Iron Throne, and the scene of Su Nantian sitting on it to reprimand him was etched in his memory.

Seeing an artifact destroyed, he felt genuine pain. Not only him, but even Du Changwei, with his vast resources, felt some regret.

"Um... next time, tell Xiao Su not to destroy things. If he needs materials, we can prepare them for him. Perhaps we'll need his help to craft something later."

The materials were not lacking in the Dragon Group. Though they had no high-end items, common low-grade ones were available in abundance. What was missing was truly skilled artificers. Without a master artisan, even the materials could only be used to craft conventional weapons. Though these might be sharper and sturdier than ordinary iron, what good was that?

Who would use common weapons when they could wield a divine one?

With sufficient materials added, the Geng Jin Sword finally took shape. The golden Geng Jin material formed its core, while a layer of black Xuan Tie was applied to the surface. This made the previously radiant long sword appear rather plain and unassuming.

Yet, this layer of Xuan Tie significantly enhanced the sword's durability and sharpness. After all, gold was soft; even with a talisman array, its strength remained questionable. By incorporating Xuan Tie, it naturally became stronger. Su Nantian would never admit that the materials were insufficient.

Besides the Do Tian Shen Sha Sword Array, Su Nantian also inscribed arrays such as Feiyu (Flying Feather), Qingming (Blue Heaven), Fengru (Sharpness), and Jingu (Sturdiness). This allowed the long sword to serve as a base for the Twelve Shen Sha Sword Array while also being an independent and powerful flying sword.

Carrying Geng Jin energy, it was meant for cutting and killing—this was no idle boast. Even within the monitoring room, they could sense its power.

Even Zhang An, who focused on body cultivation rather than weapons, found himself drooling at the sight of the sword. His previous anger over Su Nantian destroying the golden statue had vanished entirely.

In fact, he was already thinking: if there were more golden statues, how many would Su Nantian destroy? Just give me a sword.

Could it be forged into gloves?

Since Su Nantian had entered the secret chamber to refine the sword, about two and a half hours—roughly four or five hours—had passed. These three had watched for nearly five hours in the monitoring room.

Although Du Changwei was merely an ordinary person without any special abilities, he still stared intently at the sword. Perhaps everyone had a premonition that this sword would soon stir up风云 (storm and clouds), becoming renowned worldwide.

At the very birth of this sword, they had already determined it would be a world-renowned treasure. To witness its emergence was no small feat for their own bragging rights.

As the final array was drawn, the floating seals on the flying sword instantly vanished into it. The sword then reverted to a simple, unadorned broadsword.

With an over-30-centimeter hilt, it could be held with both hands. A palm-width blade was sufficient to inspire fear. Its total length exceeded one meter and twenty centimeters, and anyone holding it would feel the immense power within.

This sword was now complete!

Su Nantian inscribed his spiritual awareness into it. With a slight activation, the sword hovered in midair. A brilliant blade of light danced and circled throughout the secret chamber.

Though larger than ordinary flying swords, it remained remarkably agile without any clumsiness. The three in the monitoring room were wide-eyed with desire, longing to snatch it from Su Nantian's hands.

Even Du Changwei, an ordinary person, was filled with longing. Though he had no talent for cultivation, perhaps he could still become a cultivator? After all, staying up late was common. Perhaps his cultivation potential was exceptional.

As a man, whether young or old, who didn't dream of wielding a sword and wandering the world? All Chinese men had a wuxia or xianxia dream.

Even Su Nantian was quite satisfied. The long sword had been crafted well; his skills hadn't dulled.

With a slight movement of his brow, a tip of the sword appeared. Fu Yun, nurtured within it, also materialized beside Su Nantian.

Compared to this new divine sword, which was more suitable for hand-to-hand combat, Fu Yun's design was traditional and better suited for control.

Using the remaining Geng Jin energy, Su Nantian cultivated Fu Yun to a higher level. He was satisfied.

As his personal flying sword, no matter what high-quality material it was, Fu Yun would always receive a share. After all, these were the fundamental methods.

He sheathed Fu Yun and another blade of light appeared before him. This was a shadow of Fu Yun previously separated, but now it had become the base for the Twelve Do Tian Shen Sha Sword Array.

There were eleven such blades in Su Nantian's mind, and together they formed the Do Tian Twelve Shen Sha Sword Array.

With a gentle push forward, this blade of light merged into the broadsword.

"From now on, its name is 'Hatred.'"

The hovering long sword trembled slightly, as if in acknowledgment. Su Nantian's naming skills were lacking; he simply named it after the Do Tian Twelve Shen Sha Sword, a Western Geng Jin sword carrying the energy of hatred. It was acceptable.

The next step was to awaken the Do Tian Shen Sha power into the sword!

From the moment he arrived in Kyoto, Su Nantian had noticed that the entire city was shrouded by an immense and chaotic aura of demonic energy.

On one hand, Kyoto had been the capital of ancient kingdoms. Countless emperors ruled here, and countless emperors had perished here.

On the other hand, as the capital, it had witnessed countless bloodshed and countless lives lost. The overwhelming hatred and demonic energy darkened the sky.

Moreover, Kyoto was now a city with nearly a massive population. Every day, people living here faced various negative events, and the accumulated demonic energy was an unimaginable force.

Su Nantian even doubted how Kyoto could remain a major city under such overwhelming demonic energy.

In this environment, ordinary people couldn't survive. Even death would turn them into zombies or evil spirits.

One morning, Su Nantian looked toward the Forbidden City and saw a red light rising from there, spreading across the sky!

At that moment, all the demonic energy was subdued, unable to resist. Su Nantian finally understood why these people could live here and why the city remained prosperous.

It was the national fortune! Without the imperial golden dragon's fortune to protect the nation, a country's fortune manifested in another way!

Under this fortune's blessing, all people of Kyoto could live safely, and the city continued to thrive!

Su Nantian couldn't help but admire the strength of ordinary people. Even demonic energy that left cultivators helpless would yield to human will.

However, no matter what, this demonic energy was merely suppressed and still existed. For Su Nantian, it was the best possible scenario. This demonic energy would become nourishment for his Twelve Do Tian Shen Sha Sword Array, and the dragon-shaped demonic energy could significantly enhance the array's power!

Once Su Nantian completed this sword array, Kyoto's demonic energy would propel it to an unparalleled strength and completely resolve the city's demonic energy problem.

The blade of light entered, and the hatred divine sword trembled slightly. Visibly, its surrounding space darkened a bit, as an unknown power continuously infused into the blade.

This was the power of hatred. Su Nantian divided the demonic energy in the world into twelve types, corresponding to twelve negative emotions.

Now, one of these—hatred—was continuously infused into the divine sword, instantly enhancing its power!

This demonic energy was so vast that even Su Nantian felt a bit fearful.

He left the divine sword in the secret chamber to gather strength and retreated outside.

In the monitoring room, Du Changwei, Zhu Jie, and Zhang An exchanged glances. They all knew that this matter couldn't be disclosed.

After all, eavesdropping on others' privacy was not a commendable act.

They pretended to be nonchalant and informed Su Nantian that his mission had arrived. The matter regarding vampires in the northern city of Han Cheng could no longer be delayed, so Su Nantian needed to go there.

The divine sword would remain here. Su Nantian felt quite at ease. After all, no one else could control this flying sword, and to them, it was an absolute凶器 (evil weapon). Even touching it could cause demonic energy to enter the body, leading to a spiritual mishap.

According to Su Nantian's estimation, the first phase of absorption would take about a month. During this time, the divine sword would reach a relatively saturated state.

Afterward, the absorption speed would slow down but still increase daily. One day, this divine sword would reach an intensity that terrified everyone!

Of course, with the current materials at his disposal, Su Nantian couldn't yet upgrade it to that level.

In Du Changwei's office, Old Du rarely read the newspaper. Instead, he tapped his fingers on the desk, deep in thought.

Zhu Jie and Zhang An stood before him, unsure what Old Du was hesitating about.

Su Nantian's assignment had been decided. It was absolutely necessary to have him join the Dragon Group, even without strong abilities. After all, his artificer skills alone were invaluable. Zhang An still hoped to one day become a sycophant, pleasing Su Nantian so he could help craft a pair of gloves.

Currently, his pair of battle gloves was fierce and bloodthirsty but too brutal for conventional weapons.

" I'm hesitating... According to the Dragon Group's tradition, field missions require two people. So, who do you think could be Su Nantian's partner?"

After hearing Old Du's words, they realized he was hesitating over this issue. But upon reflection, it truly was a problem.

With Su Nantian's strength, the Dragon Group would definitely assign him the most dangerous and challenging missions. Though these might not be difficult for Su Nantian, if his partner lacked strength, he would drag them down. A mission that could have been completed might then fail—this would be a loss.

"Zhang An, how about you take the lead for a while?"

Old Du cast an encouraging glance at Zhang An. Zhang An was his most capable subordinate.

Those breakthrough masters were busy with cultivation or containing other forces. The strongest available was Zhang An's level.

"I?"

Zhang An was taken aback, not expecting Old Du to mention his name. Still, he asked in confusion: "I don't mind, but what about Old Liu?"

Old Liu was Zhang An's teammate. His strength was slightly weaker than Zhang An's, but he had great strategies and brains. Usually, while Zhang An was stronger, most tasks were handled by Old Liu.

This situation was humorously referred to within the group as "Old Liu was Zhang An's brain, and Zhang An was Old Liu's limbs." In essence, they were one.

The atmosphere often felt gay and queer, which Zhu Jie enjoyed.

However, Old Liu had recently been injured and was recovering. He would soon be back on duty. But before his return, having his teammate taken away was not quite proper.

Hearing Zhang An's words, Du Changwei felt awkward. If this were done, it would certainly disappoint people.

Zhang An, who usually didn't think much, suddenly spoke: "If I'm to find a partner for Su Nantian, I have a good candidate."

"Uh?"

Both the protagonist and Du Changwei turned their surprised glances toward Zhang An. They hadn't expected him to speak up, as he usually didn't think much.

Chapter 279: Arrival in Han Cheng

"Ahem..." Under the two's gaze, Zhang An felt a bit awkward but still spoke: "I think Old Tang is good. I saw him and Su Nantian talking in the rest room, they were quite amicable and even drank water together."

Hearing about drinking water, Zhu Jie and Du Changwei's eyes widened further. This Old Tang was truly peculiar.

Within the Dragon Group, he had never been popular. If it weren't for his high strength and the group's desperate need for personnel, he would have been fired long ago.

The main reason for his poor relationships was that he often tested his teammates with poison. Almost everyone in the Dragon Group had been poisoned by him, except Du Changwei.

Although it wasn't necessarily a deadly poison, making a cultivation expert suffer from diarrhea all day was definitely not a pleasant experience.

"Is Tang Sanfeng suitable?"

Du Changwei hesitated. Both Su Nantian and Du Changwei were people who avoided trouble. Putting two troublemakers in the same team was not necessarily a good idea.

"Let's try, there are no other idle personnel in the Dragon Group. There are only a few people without partners. Among them, Tang Sanfeng is the most suitable. We can't disband existing teams just to accommodate Su Nantian."

Zhu Jie, who hadn't spoken before, said this, hitting the key point.

Since there were no better choices, it had to be Tang Sanfeng.

When Zhang An found him, he was hiding in the Dragon Group base's restroom, looking quite defeated.

It turned out that the medicine he added to Su Nantian's drink had not been wasted. Even after eating fake medicine, he had sat there for over an hour.

"What? Let me go on a mission? Don't you fear I might kill an entire city's people if I'm unhappy?"

Saying this, Tang Sanfeng rolled his eyes and looked uninterested.

He wouldn't go as far as killing an entire city, but the mission targets he touched never returned alive—only corpses.

For this, Zhang An had already prepared mentally. He called Su Nantian and introduced the mission details, then dismissed it.

The two of them vaguely boarded a train to Han Cheng. Upon boarding the train, they only then realized.

"Hey Old Tang, are we being tricked?"

Hearing Su Nantian's words, Old Tang looked at him with a puzzled gaze.

"From Kyoto to Han Cheng, there's an airplane. Even if there isn't one, there would be a high-speed rail. Why are we taking the train, and even an air-conditioned express—hard seats?"

After hearing Su Nantian's words, Tang Sanfeng realized the situation. It seemed this was indeed the case, and apparently, no budget had been approved for this mission.

Never mind, don't think too much. The two of them paid for a sleeper ticket themselves, finally having a place to rest.

As for the budget, they would reimburse it after returning to the Dragon Group.

Tang Sanfeng said he had never heard of anyone daring to steal their budget. Perhaps they wanted to set up a bed in the restroom?

Su Nantian didn't care about these trivial matters. He was naturally laid-back and adaptable.

As long as there was food and drink, he could accept it. Now, his thoughts were about how much the divine sword of Geng Jin in the Dragon Group headquarters could reach. After all, this place had an endless supply of demonic energy.

It even gave Su Nantian a feeling that the ancient civilization of five thousand years had more abundant resources than the cultivation world, which had been passed down for countless years.

Actually, this time Su Nantian's departure wasn't without the intention of finding materials to refine his divine sword. After all, this place was in the north, cold climate—perhaps there were some water-related things.

"Let's learn to meow together, let's mew mew mew..."

A seductive song rang out. Su Nantian was startled and only then realized it was his new phone ringtone.

Before coming to Kyoto, several girls had been very reluctant. They even completely abandoned their previous restraint and spent a night together.

As for what they did or didn't do, it's up to your imagination.

In any case, this ringtone was a chorus of the girls.

"Hey Suyun, why are you already thinking about me?"

He answered the call and looked at the caller ID.

"South Sky, it's me, Jingjing." Gao Jingjing's voice was soft and sweet. Just hearing her voice could imagine that on the other end, she must be slightly lowering her head with a red face.

"Hey, it's Jingjing. How are you? Don't be naughty while I'm away! When can I come back and take you to see the big treasure?"

Hearing Su Nantian talking like this, Tang Sanfeng was really fed up.

Displaying affection was the worst thing, especially in front of this 30-something single man.

What made Tang Sanfeng even more helpless was that this guy couldn't fight him, and the poison didn't seem to work on him. He was completely helpless.

Tang Sanfeng had no choice but to cover his head with a blanket and hide himself, ignoring the sight.

On the early morning of the second day at around 5:00 AM, the two of them got off the train in Han Cheng.

Although it was only mid-October, the weather at dawn was already quite cold.

Neither Su Nantian nor Tang Sanfeng were ordinary people, and this chill was bearable. However, being able to endure it didn't mean they liked it. They both wanted to find a place where they could rest comfortably.

Honestly, both of them had never been to Han Cheng before. As soon as they got off the train, they encountered a group of elderly women who approached them热情 (enthusiastically).

"Hey young man, stay at the hotel! Young man? Hot water, computer, internet access!"

"Hey young man, stay at the hotel! 24-hour air conditioning!"

...

It was really too genuine. It seemed like this was the case everywhere.

Although it was their first time here, they hadn't eaten pork but had seen a pig run.

The two of them shook off the elderly women and took a taxi, instructing the driver: "Provincial Inspection Office!"

The usual guys were very talkative. However, seeing these two young men get on the taxi directly heading to the Provincial Inspection Office, they were so scared that they didn't say a word.

Until Su Nantian and Tang Sanfeng got off the taxi, this driver finally wiped away a cold sweat in relief.

"Ugh, I don't know why, but I feel these two guys are coming to the inspection office to turn themselves in. It's better to keep a distance."

Chapter 280: Wang Baizi

Su Nantian and Tang Sanfeng didn't care about the driver's thoughts. They got off the station, looked around, and finally determined their direction.

This was also a habit of the Dragon Group. A city's base would definitely be near the highest security department in that city.

In a nearby store, there was a sign with a yellow star at the top left. This was the sixth star.

As the sixth group of national security, they couldn't be openly revealed. They secretly protected the country and countless people.

Even this organization had existed since before the founding of the nation. How many people had sacrificed, and how many had continued to fight?

In the underground world abroad, there was a saying: China is a mysterious place and a forbidden land for mercenaries, abnormal beings, and superhumans!

It could be said that no foreigner dared to take a mission to kill in China!

The reason for this was because of the existence of this sixth star.

A red star dyed with life, red like a chess piece. The sixth star was an invisible star.

It couldn't be drawn on a flag, so it was drawn here.

This star might seem ordinary to the eyes of common people, but in the circles of those who understood, it was definitely an entity not to be trifled with.

Su Nantian and Tang Sanfeng saw this star, exchanged a smile, and found their target. They walked toward the store.

Although they had only joined the Dragon Group for a day, less than 24 hours, for some reason, when Su Nantian saw this star, a sense of shared honor and disgrace arose in his heart. It felt like there was an eerie resonance.

Shaking his head to dispel these strange thoughts, he deeply remembered this star. Though it looked like a simple decoration on the sign.

But Jiang Ci doubted whether there was some magic on it.

However, upon reflection, he felt relieved. How could I say this? This star was protected by countless strong people. It was understandable to have some supernatural power.

The two of them arrived at the store's door, and only then noticed that this store was actually a small restaurant. There were also several guest rooms on it. One of the rooms even functioned as a mahjong room, making it extremely convenient.

"Da da da da, da da da..."

Tang Sanfeng knocked on the door in a specific rhythm, playing "Two Tigers." The door finally opened. A child answered.

At that moment, he was rubbing his sleepy eyes and looked angry.

"What's wrong with you two? It's only early morning, what time is it? You came knocking at this hour. Didn't you see the business hours are from 6:00 AM?"

One sentence made Su Nantian and Tang Sanfeng look at each other in confusion, even doubting if they had found the wrong place.

Why did this reaction not seem like that of an organization member?

Before they could speak, the child looked at them again with disdain.

"Standing outside, what are you waiting for? Come in. I'm going back to sleep."

The child let them into the house and went back to his room. Su Nantian and Tang Sanfeng walked in, finally seeing a person who looked normal.

A man around 200 pounds was sitting at a table having breakfast. He was still wearing his pajamas, apparently just getting up.

The breakfast on the table was abundant: youtiao (fried dough sticks), soy milk, bread, congee, pickled vegetables, and dried fish.

Since they hadn't eaten since getting off the train, the two of them didn't hesitate and grabbed their food.

The fat man looked at them without saying anything, but his eating speed increased slightly.

Three people didn't speak for a while. They were all busy with their mouths, eating breakfast at a fast pace.

The breakfast on the table was abundant. Baozi (steamed buns), youtiao, soy milk, etc., were a combination of Chinese and Western styles.

Within minutes, the three of them had finished their meals. Tang Sanfeng belched and said:

"The taste is good, but it's a bit little."

It must be said that this guy was quite bold. Su Nantian looked at him in surprise, unsure how he managed to do that.

With this kind of cultivation method, maybe after some time, he could resist his flying sword.

The fat man's eyes were quite resentful. Grandma, this was originally my breakfast. You two came and grabbed it without saying a word. After grabbing it, you still said it was little. Where did that come from?

But playing and joking were just play and jokes. After the joke, there was still a serious matter to handle.

"Let me introduce myself. I am the administrator of the Dragon Group's branch in Han Cheng.

My surname is Wang, and you can call me Uncle Wang if you like. If not, just call me Uncle Baizi (Fat Man)."

The fat man clapped his hands and stood up, giving a self-introduction first. Then he continued: "Recently, there have been many strange incidents here. A group of vampires from abroad came and caused trouble everywhere.

At first, they targeted homeless people. But as everyone knows, vampires claim to be noble aristocrats. The blood of the homeless was too smelly for them.

After a short time, they set their sights on unmarried adult women. So far, seven people have been killed.

I've had a few confrontations with them. I wounded one but couldn't catch them. After all, my body type shows that speed isn't my strength.

So I asked for help from above. This group of vampires is about 3-5 people. There's only me as the responsible person in Han Cheng, and I'm really overwhelmed."

After Wang Baizi's introduction, Tang Sanfeng and Su Nantian nodded. They had already seen the information before coming.

Wang Baizi's intelligence was known to Su Nantian and Tang Sanfeng, but there were no more details. The only useful information was that these vampires weren't residents of Han Cheng but had recently arrived in the city.

Han Cheng was a large city, with massive population flow every day. Foreigners were numerous. Therefore, it was quite difficult to investigate these foreign vampires.

"Have you found any clues about why they came to Han Cheng? After all, China isn't a place where they can just come for vacation. They don't usually enter our country without important reasons."

After thinking for a while, Tang Sanfeng asked this key question. Although he wasn't popular in the Dragon Group, when it came to mission experience, at least he had more than Su Nantian.

"There are some clues. It's said they recently discovered an ancient tomb and obtained information that a vampire holy relic was stored in the Han Cheng Museum."

Chapter 281: Better to Kill by Mistake than Let One Escape

Hearing Wang Baizi's answer, Su Nantian and Tang Sanfeng both frowned.

Vampires in Han Cheng. The three of them stared at each other without a clue. They had no idea which item was related to the vampires. The museum had increased security, and they could act immediately if there were any signs.

But now, there was no sign at all.

They sat there drinking blood and couldn't find any clues. They were about to get sleepy and go back for a nap when the door was knocked again.

A junior inspector came in, wearing a uniform and looking young. He glanced at Su Nantian and Tang Sanfeng, then gave Wang Baizi a signal.

Wang Baizi patted his shoulder and introduced: "Don't be afraid. This is my colleague from the Beijing headquarters, Su Nantian and Tang Sanfeng."

Hearing they were from the Beijing headquarters, the junior inspector's wary expression finally eased. He smiled a bit awkwardly and said: "Another victim was found with the same symptoms as before. There were bite marks on her neck. It should be them, so I was told to call Uncle Wang."

Okay, what else is there to say? Let's go.

Su Nantian and Old Tang didn't rest anymore but went to the crime scene together.

The crime scene was in the area of Lingzhou, Han Cheng. There were many bars there, and every night it was a place of lights and red wine, indulgence.

The population flow was very dense. It was quite normal for vampires to commit crimes here, as there were many targets. Each person was drunk and easy to catch. Moreover, everyone had a legitimate reason for coming here.

When Su Nantian and the others arrived at the scene, the inspection had already controlled it. This was a back alley of a bar called "Jo Six Six Six." The victim was a girl around twenty years old, with smoky makeup. She looked somewhat like a streetwise girl.

She wasn't necessarily a bad girl, but she wasn't the kind of obedient girl.

Originally a lively young woman, now she lay there, cold and lifeless.

Her skin had lost its luster. She looked pale from excessive blood loss.

Besides the two bite marks on her neck, there were no other wounds. She looked like a princess sleeping, but she would never wake up again.

Seeing this girl lying on the ground, Su Nantian felt a strange sense of anger.

He didn't know what emotion it was, but after 20,000 years of cultivation and witnessing countless deaths, he had seen many lives fade away. Even those he had killed himself were countless.

But today, seeing this lifeless girl, she felt a strange sense of anger and frustration. Perhaps it was because they were both humans, seeing their fellow beings being eaten by other creatures, and feeling a sense of sympathy for the victim.

Maybe this idiom wasn't quite appropriate here, but Su Nantian didn't care anymore.

The sword mark on his forehead was slightly twitching. He wanted to kill!

After 20,000 years of cultivation, he had lived a life of detachment. He wasn't skilled in human emotions. In his view, any matter could be solved with one sword; if not, then another!

Feeling the lingering blood scent in the air, Su Nantian stepped forward. Soon he reached the front of the bar.

"Jo Six Six Six," he didn't know who named this bar, but it looked quite out of place.

Anyway, Su Nantian didn't care. He pushed open the bar's door. Inside was somewhat quiet.

Only a few drunk customers were still asleep, and five or six servers were cleaning up.

It was strangely rare for a bar to be open at 6:00 AM.

Su Nantian approached the bar counter, where a bartender was cleaning it. A handsome foreigner sat there, drinking with no real purpose.

Su Nantian sat down and glanced at her carefully. His brows furrowed slightly.

Smelling the blood scent, he wore a mysterious smile.

"Vampire?"

His voice was soft but enough for the other to hear. Though it was a question, it was very certain.

Hearing Su Nantian's words, the foreigner blinked in surprise and turned to look at him: "Young Chinese cultivator, do you know that asking about others' privacy is very immoral? I have a legal identity to enter, and I haven't done anything against the rules. So you can't attack me."

Hearing his words, Su Nantian sneered. Stupid guy, do I need a reason to attack you?

His smile hadn't disappeared yet, and his hand was already on the other's head. He smashed it against the bar counter.

Even if vampires were a slightly capable race, they couldn't fight with their heads against the marble bar counter.

It smashed down and knocked him unconscious, blood flowing from his handsome face. He looked very pitiful.

Su Nantian didn't care about the stunned bartender and directly pulled him out. He dragged him all the way to the back alley.
