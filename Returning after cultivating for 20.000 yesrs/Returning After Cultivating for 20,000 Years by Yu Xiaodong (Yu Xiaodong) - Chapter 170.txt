It had been days since they last saw each other, and with their illicit relationship already in place, the slightest breeze of spring had reignited their desires. Hongye and Xu Xiangning exchanged a deep gaze, filling the room with an intoxicating atmosphere.

As Madam Xu had predicted, Xu Xiangning was instantly swayed by Hongye’s charm, with no trace of suspicion. Indeed, she fully believed his words, without the slightest resentment. She even felt that the Xu family had always looked down on her, so no matter how painstakingly she unearthed these secrets, they were still deemed insignificant by their eyes. Thus, Xu Xiangning redirected her resentment, believing that in time she would surpass them and show them her strength.

As for now, it was simply about seizing the moments of solitude between them—doing as they pleased.

The Xu family and Hongye had already taken action, and Qi Yinzhen, who was searching for Su Nantian, was no exception. He had already vowed that if he failed to find Su Nantian, he would bring chaos upon the Nan Gong family and prevent them from monopolizing their position as the top clan in inland port.

Thus, Qi Yinzhen continued his search for Su Nantian while diverting half his efforts to undermining the Nan Gong family, ensuring they could not catch their breath. He aimed to fracture their unity and bring them down from their lofty position, no longer the most formidable family in inland port.

Qi Yinzhen was highly skilled; previously, he had been a technician assisting Su Nantian. Meanwhile, Su Nantian handled external affairs, dealing with stubborn enemies. During their collaboration, Qi Yinzhen had witnessed various events and now could easily employ several strategies. Defeating the Nan Gong family was effortless for him.

Qi Yinzhen did not personally intervene but instead spread whispers to the smaller clans who disliked the Nan Gong family, constantly sowing discord among them.

Chapter 849: Sowing Discord

Additionally, Qi Yinzhen subtly fragmented the Nan Gong family’s business ventures, preventing them from monopolizing inland port. Other small clans, seeing an opportunity for profit, flocked to the scene without regard for the Nan Gong family’s dignity.

During this period, Qi Yinzhen closely monitored the Nan Gong family’s movements. Any internal news would be swiftly disseminated, leaving them unable to conceal anything. Many deals that had been finalized were intercepted at the last moment.

More alarming was their inability to uncover who leaked these secrets or identify those targeting the Nan Gong family.

“Father, this is not the first time!”

Nan Gong Yuyan quickly approached Nan Gong Lin, her expression filled with urgency as she implored him for a solution. Every time the Nan Gong family showed signs of resurgence, it was swiftly crushed, leaving them no chance to breathe.

Thinking of this, Nan Gong Yuyan was certain someone was targeting the family; otherwise, these strategies would not be so targeted.

“Cough… cough…”

Nan Gong Lin sat on his throne, and upon hearing his daughter’s words, he did not immediately respond but instead coughed violently. His health had always been frail, and years of exhaustion had drained his vitality. Now, preoccupied with the family’s internal and external affairs, he had neglected proper rest. His body was now on the verge of collapse.

His face was ashen, appearing ready to fall at any moment. When he heard Nan Gong Yuyan’s words, his brow furrowed deeply, a shadow of concern spreading across his face.

He too knew the Nan Gong family had been targeted by an adversary, and though such incidents were not unheard of before, he had always managed to uncover them and counteract the threat. However, this time was different—his opponent had launched a meticulously planned attack, catching them off guard.

Moreover, the adversary was exceptionally cautious, having provoked them repeatedly yet revealing no trace of themselves. These circumstances indicated a formidable opponent whose abilities surpassed those of the Nan Gong family. The more he pondered, the more anxious he became, worsening his condition and deepening the vicious cycle.

“Father, our latest shipment was intercepted by customs!”

At this moment, Nan Gong Ping rushed into the room without knocking, his urgency overriding protocol. Seeing Nan Gong Yuyan there, he frowned disapprovingly.

In recent times, the siblings had been in constant discord due to a growing rumor—that Nan Gong Lin intended to pass the family leadership to Nan Gong Yuyan, deeming Nan Gong Ping’s intelligence inferior.

Though Nan Gong Ping was aware of his own shortcomings, no one welcomed being mocked or ridiculed. Thus, he harbored resentment toward Nan Gong Yuyan, his words laced with hostility.

Nan Gong Yuyan, who had never respected her mediocre elder brother, felt even more disdain for him after Nan Gong Lin’s intention to favor their son. She believed it was due to gender bias that her talents were overlooked.

Seeing Nan Gong Ping’s disapproval, she met his gaze with equal defiance. They had never considered that this incident was orchestrated by an unseen hand, otherwise it would not have escalated so rapidly.

Or perhaps this incident had provided them a platform to finally reveal their mutual resentment without pretense. Thus, they默契 (mutually) avoided delving deeper into the truth.

Because of this, Nan Gong Ping believed Nan Gong Yuyan had long harbored ambitions, constantly targeting him and striving to impress their father.

Now seeing her in their father’s room, he was deeply dissatisfied. Were it not for his fear of Nan Gong Lin, he would have ordered her out immediately.

“Sister is here too? I noticed the weather was pleasant today; Miss Li and Miss Chen went boating. Why didn’t you join them?”

Nan Gong Ping greeted Nan Gong Yuyan first, adopting a polite approach before continuing: “Girls should spend their time shopping and beautifying themselves, gossiping instead of overworking. If you lack funds, I still have spare credit cards for your use—just enjoy yourself.”

Though his words seemed to express concern, they stung Nan Gong Yuyan’s ears. She would never be grateful for her brother’s “concern.”

Nan Gong Ping’s words clearly implied she was merely a pretty ornament, of no real value.

Nan Gong Yuyan, who had long harbored ambition due to her intelligence and constant praise, furrowed her brows upon hearing this.

“I am different from other girls; I have no interest in that.”

She continued, “But brother, the family’s affairs are already chaotic. You should not spend all your time drinking and socializing with friends—consider our father more.”

She then cast a provocative glance at Nan Gong Ping, effectively giving him the same treatment he had given her.

They were both determined to avoid being targeted, ensuring neither gained the upper hand.

“You!”

Nan Gong Ping’s frustration deepened upon hearing his sister’s words. He had been preoccupied with work, merely accompanying friends for a break. Yet this single act was now criticized by Nan Gong Yuyan, as if he lacked ability in their father’s eyes.

Chapter 850: Internal Strife

“Stop talking about how you waste your time with pigs and dogs!”

His father already had a poor opinion of him; this remark would only worsen it.

“Enough, let’s not dwell on this.”

Nan Gong Lin finally spoke, interrupting their quarrel. He was no fool; despite his many burdens, he could sense the tension between them.

Though worried, he had no time to soothe their quarrels.

“Didn’t you say our cargo was intercepted by customs?”

Nan Gong Lin resumed the discussion, drawing everyone’s attention back to business.

Nan Gong Ping nodded immediately: “Yes, father. We had already sent people to smooth things over, but today’s team was different—they took our cargo without warning and refused to return it!”

He expressed his frustration, feeling their troubles were deliberate.

After Wu Chuan’s death, the Nan Gong family had become the top clan in inland port. They were showered with gifts from smaller clans, desperate to avoid being left behind.

Yet within days, these same clans had revealed their true colors, eagerly awaiting the Nan Gong family’s downfall to seize a share of the spoils.

“What is going on?”

Nan Gong Lin furrowed his brow, sensing the suspicious nature of this incident.

The Nan Gong family held significant status in inland port and controlled major ports through their cargo operations. They had long maintained good relations with customs, and such incidents had never occurred before.

Neither the Nan Gong family nor other clans would typically have their cargo inspected, let alone seized entirely.

Each detail hinted at a massive problem, unsettling Nan Gong Lin deeply.

Could their adversary truly be so powerful as to manipulate every aspect?

This thought only deepened his frustration, leaving him unsure of how to proceed. Who was targeting the Nan Gong family?

“Father, I know! It must be Su Nantian!”

Nan Gong Yuyan spoke up, then cast a resentful glance at Nan Gong Ping. She thought if it weren’t for her brother’s foolishness in inviting trouble, the family would not be in this situation.

Thinking of Su Nantian, she recalled her earlier threats—she had believed they would deter him. Yet he had ignored them entirely, showing no intention of obeying her commands.

The thought of being outwitted by Su Nantian filled her with anger and frustration. If he were here now, she would tear him apart to silence his arrogance.

“Su Nantian?”

Nan Gong Yuyan’s words had the effect of a thunderclap, causing both Nan Gong Lin and Nan Gong Ping to exclaim in unison. They had not expected this connection.

“He’s dead, isn’t he? What does that have to do with it?”

They assumed Su Nantian had perished in the sea, so they found her suspicion hard to believe.

“If he were truly dead, why have we encountered these problems?”

Nan Gong Yuyan shook her head, reaffirming her conclusion. She then explained to Nan Gong Lin:

“Father, consider when our family’s problems began—after Su Nantian killed Wu Chuan and disappeared!”

She locked eyes with Nan Gong Lin, speaking deliberately: “If it weren’t connected to him, this would be too suspicious!”

Her explanation silenced the others, who began pondering the connection. After a moment of reflection, they realized Nan Gong Yuyan was correct.

This incident was undeniably linked to Su Nantian. The timing was too coincidental; otherwise, they could not accept it.

“Could it really be him? But what background does he have that allows him to manipulate us so thoroughly?”

Nan Gong Lin’s anger flared, especially recalling how he had trusted Su Nantian enough to send Nan Gong Qian to monitor his children. He realized now he had been used as a stepping stone.

The thought of being deceived and humiliated by Su Nantian was unbearable, especially as the head of the Nan Gong family. How could he allow his entire clan’s dignity to be trampled?

“Regardless of his background, I still don’t understand why he would target us.”

Nan Gong Yuyan shook her head, voicing her confusion. She paused before continuing: “Father, we’ve never threatened him. His goal was to rescue Wu Youer, and there’s no conflict with us.”

She hesitated before adding: “Yet he killed Wu Chuan and then targeted our family. Why? I still can’t figure it out.”

This was truly strange; she had considered many possibilities, all of which she dismissed.

Nan Gong Yuyan’s words reflected her genuine confusion—she could not fathom why Su Nantian would target them.

Inland port was but a small place, and she believed Su Nantian could easily dominate it. Why then resort to underhanded tactics?

Chapter 851: Internal Issues

The most terrifying aspect was their failure to uncover any trace of Su Nantian. This meant he had long concealed his identity, but why? What benefit did this bring him? Why go to such lengths for something so ungrateful?

This mystery eluded even Nan Gong Lin. At this moment, he too fell silent, unable to decipher Su Nantian’s motives.

He shared Nan Gong Yuyan’s confusion, believing Su Nantian could easily seize inland port without such a convoluted plan.

After this realization, Nan Gong Lin furrowed his brow, as if a more terrifying suspicion had struck him. This thought unsettled him and made him wish Su Nantian would return to challenge their position in inland port.

“Yuyan, think carefully—could we have been wrong all along? Perhaps this has nothing to do with Su Nantian?”

Nan Gong Lin looked at Nan Gong Yuyan, speaking deliberately.

Nan Gong Yuyan frowned, about to object.

Nan Gong Lin waved his hand, signaling her not to rush, then continued: “The one orchestrating these schemes is a new rising force in inland port. They know us well and other small clans, suggesting they’ve been watching us for a long time.”

He paused before adding: “They’re taking advantage of Wu Chuan’s downfall, pretending to be supernatural.”

“Exactly!”

Nan Gong Yuyan took a step back, her face filled with disbelief. Her initial suspicions of Su Nantian had many inconsistencies she could not explain. If this were true, how could it be so difficult?

The only explanation was that this incident had nothing to do with Su Nantian, but rather a new force had emerged.

This person’s actions matched Nan Gong Lin’s theory—hiding in the shadows, striking when unprepared.

At that moment, Qian Yinzhen, hiding outside the window, couldn’t help but chuckle.

It was amusing to eavesdrop on the Nan Gong family’s deliberations, especially as they made foolish guesses and became increasingly agitated.

Though he had not yet found Su Nantian, his small moves had already fragmented the Nan Gong family. Many of their monopolized industries were now given to obscure small clans.

In short, the Nan Gong family’s power had significantly declined.

But this was only the beginning; Qian Yinzhen had promised to make the Nan Gong family suffer until he found Su Nantian.

Of course, he would not destroy them outright—otherwise, how could he continue playing? He would let them linger on the brink of death, forcing them to struggle helplessly under his watchful eye.

After this realization, Qian Yinzhen coldly glanced at the people inside before vanishing into the night as if he had never been there.

“Tian, where are you?”

Qian Yinzhen thought to himself, especially recalling how his search over the past month had yielded nothing. Even the headquarters had grown indifferent, no longer as proactive.

Several times, Qian Yinzhen had asked them for help, but they seemed reluctant and evasive.

This thought only deepened his worry—how long would it take to find Su Nantian?

“Tian, please stay safe!”

Qian Yinzhen thought again, believing Su Nantian was fortunate and would survive.

Meanwhile, after Qian Yinzhen left, the three Nan Gong family members continued their discussion. They had found a new direction and planned to investigate elsewhere for the mastermind behind this.

Nan Gong Yuyan and Nan Gong Ping received their assignments from Nan Gong Lin, bowing respectfully before leaving. They did not know that as they turned away, Nan Gong Lin immediately covered his mouth and coughed violently. When he opened his palm, a noticeable bloodstain was visible.

“Nan Gong Yuyan! I warn you, don’t disrupt my affairs or interfere with my plans!”

They had barely left when Nan Gong Ping stopped, his tone threatening as he addressed Nan Gong Yuyan.

“Haha, now that father isn’t here, you don’t need to pretend anymore, do you? Earlier, you called me brother so affectionately!”

Nan Gong Yuyan mocked him. She had no regard for this brother, merely disliking him.

“I’ll return your words to you—don’t disrupt my affairs.”

Nan Gong Yuyan did not wait for Nan Gong Ping’s reply but glared at him before swiftly leaving, giving him no chance to respond.

“You!”

Nan Gong Ping stared at Nan Gong Yuyan’s retreating figure, his eyes widening in anger.

This sister was becoming increasingly unbearable! When he became the family head, he would be the first to expel her without even a dowry.

While they were unsettled, Hongye also took action. After calming Xu Xiangning, he immediately signaled his subordinates to resume searching for Longge and Achuan’s disappearance site.

“Remember, move quickly—we must find Su Nantian before the Xu family discovers this!”

Hongye earnestly instructed his assistant, emphasizing their urgency.

“This isn’t a joke—give it your full attention!”

He had invested so much effort in searching for Su Nantian to secure a bargaining chip with the Xu family.

Chapter 852: Calculations on All Sides

But if this chip was discovered by the Xu family before he found Su Nantian, it would become useless.

This was why he insisted so strongly.

“Yes!”

Bai’s assistant respectfully replied, showing no hesitation.

Hongye waved his hand, dismissing Bai.

Yet at this moment, they were unaware that there was no need for such effort to find Su Nantian. In fact, the person they sought had already arrived at Hongye’s doorstep and was approaching closer.

If Hongye knew this, he would not sleep soundly even at night.

The next morning, the search for Longge and Achuan was already yielding results.

Because of Hongye’s previous harsh treatment, no one dared to delay, and they promptly reported the news.

“Bai Shi Town?”

Hongye was taken aback upon hearing the final location, then inquired further: “Is there more detail? Where exactly is this town?”

It was such a remote place that even Hongye had never heard of it. He prided himself on having traversed many places, yet this was unknown to him.

“This is where Longge and Achuan last activated their devices. However, the direction they faced leads to two places: one is a desolate fishing village.”

This village was named after the villagers’ lifestyle.

After a pause, Bai continued: “There is also a Liu family village nearby.”

“I have dispatched two teams to investigate these villages. Once there is news, they will report immediately.”

The assistant reported respectfully to Hongye, learning the name of the fishing village for the first time.

It was likely absent from maps, so they would first head to Bai Shi Town and then investigate along the way.

“Good, go investigate. If you confirm Su Nantian is there, do not act rashly—return to report first.”

Seeing these people were no longer idle and could help him with minor issues, Hongye’s mood improved significantly. He felt they were no longer as repulsive as before.

He also reminded them to report back first, not to rush into dealing with Su Nantian.

Because of Longge and Achuan’s situation, Hongye had learned a lesson—that Su Nantian was no pushover. Their disappearance likely meant they were dealt with by Su Nantian.

Thus, Hongye would carefully plan before confirming Su Nantian’s location. He would not personally go but instead relay the information to the Xu family.

This way, he could gain favor with the Xu family while preserving their strength without loss.

Hongye had gone through great effort to obtain Su Nantian’s video, learning of his unique abilities.

He did not want to waste his carefully trained subordinates on such a formidable opponent. This matter would naturally be handed over to the Xu family, as he had killed their grandson and it was unrelated to him.

On the contrary, if Hongye informed the Xu family, they would be grateful and express deep appreciation.

Hongye could then gradually climb by following this path without remaining a lowly figure in M City.

Hongye had once been an uneducated thug, but his ruthlessness and cunning had allowed him to rise step by step to this position.

Yet he was still merely a local strongman compared to these deep-rooted families, who likely looked down on him entirely.

Because Hongye had worked so hard to reach this position, he felt the value of these achievements even more. His ambitions were now firmly set.

Hongye vowed to rise further, not content with being a lowly mud creature beneath others’ feet.

Xu Xiangning was now his stepping stone, and Su Nantian’s situation was his ladder to ascend.

He would surely make the most of this opportunity and not miss it.

“Yes, Hongye!”

Though these subordinates did not know what Hongye was thinking, they followed his orders without question.

Anyone daring to challenge or doubt Hongye would be seeking death.

They had learned this through years of working under him, and no one dared to test Hongye’s limits.

They quickly left to investigate Su Nantian’s whereabouts as instructed, while Bai remained behind, hesitating.

“Hongye, this is a golden opportunity—why not personally capture Su Nantian and hand him over to the Xu family? That would be a greater achievement.”

Bai had worked with Hongye for years and understood his ambitions. He thought of a better plan: first eliminate the threat for the Xu family, then bring Su Nantian’s head to them. This would make the Xu family value Hongye more and grant him an opportunity.

“Haha, if it were that simple.”

Hongye let out a cold laugh and looked at the assistant with disdain. “Do you think I haven’t considered this?”

He glanced at Bai, as if mocking his meddling.

“I apologize for overstepping, sir. I only wish to contribute my humble efforts and have no other intentions!”

Bai immediately knelt in apology, fearing Hongye would suspect ulterior motives and eliminate him.

“Don’t worry; I won’t deal with you.”

Hongye waved his hand, signaling him to rise. “This Su Nantian is no ordinary person. Do you think I wouldn’t want to personally capture him?”

Hongye paused, knowing their strength was too uneven. The gap was too great to confront Su Nantian directly.

Chapter 853: Confrontation

He had now devised the most conservative plan—locate Su Nantian and report it to the Xu family.

This would save time and effort, avoid a direct confrontation with Su Nantian, the formidable adversary, and also serve the Xu family—truly a win-win solution.

“Hongye is wise; I knew you had your own plans!”

Bai sighed in relief upon hearing Hongye’s words. However, his heart remained tense and he dared not relax immediately. He quickly praised Hongye to flatter him.

“Enough, don’t talk more—send more people out to search. If this is wrong and Su Nantian isn’t in the fishing village or Liu family village, you must find him quickly!”

Hongye waved his hand again, indicating he did not wish to continue the conversation.

“Yes, I’ll take my leave!”

Bai understood Hongye wanted to be alone and quickly nodded, not daring to bother him further.

After everyone left, Hongye’s gaze darkened again, as if thinking of other matters.

His hand slowly rested on the table, lightly tapping with rhythm.

Then Hongye smiled slyly: “Su Nantian, Su Nantian—be a stepping stone for me and help me ascend to the heavens!”

At this moment, Su Nantian had already arrived in M City.

Hongye had no idea that he didn’t need to go through the trouble of sending people to find Su Nantian. After all, this adversary he considered unmatchable had already come looking for him.

Su Nantian had arrived on his own, and now it was a matter of whether Hongye had the ability to capture him or the courage.

“Hongye.”

Su Nantian spoke, his tone calm yet slightly mocking.

Su Nantian had now developed some interest; he wanted to see what kind of person Hongye was and why he had gone through so much trouble to find him.

Moreover, Su Nantian had already made up his mind—when he met Hongye, he would press him for answers and use him to uncover the truth about his origins.

Su Nantian had now decided that Hongye was the one who could provide the answers he sought. Thus, he did not stop but immediately approached someone in M City to inquire about Hongye’s address.

Longge and Achuan had said that Hongye was a local strongman in M City, so everyone there would know him. A few inquiries would reveal Hongye’s address.

Indeed, Su Nantian only needed to ask a few people before obtaining the complete address and learning where Hongye lived.

“Go to Huagui Garden.”

Su Nantian hailed a taxi and calmly gave the address.

Huagui Garden, what an expensive name.

But would this Hongye be able to handle it?

The taxi driver was frightened by Su Nantian’s aura, though he found Su Nantian handsome and imposing. However, his demeanor made the driver extremely nervous.

But upon hearing Su Nantian’s destination—Huagui Garden—the taxi driver’s face showed understanding.

“Ah, it’s Hongye’s people. No wonder he has such a cold demeanor.”

The driver had initially wanted to refuse the ride but, realizing Su Nantian was Hongye’s man, dared not refuse and reluctantly took him there.

Meanwhile, the Xu family had also begun their secret planning.

Xu Hai hurried to Madam Xu’s room, knocked on the door, and entered immediately. Upon seeing Madam Xu, he quickly stated his purpose: “Mother, as you predicted, my sister went to see Hongye and was likely seeking an explanation.”

He carefully observed Madam Xu’s expression as he spoke.

Madam Xu showed no reaction and did not interrupt him, merely signaling for him to continue.

“But my sister returned quickly, looking radiant and apparently swayed by Hongye.”

At this point, Xu Hai felt a bit embarrassed. Though he and Xu Xiangning were siblings, the thought of his sister humiliating their family made him feel ashamed.
