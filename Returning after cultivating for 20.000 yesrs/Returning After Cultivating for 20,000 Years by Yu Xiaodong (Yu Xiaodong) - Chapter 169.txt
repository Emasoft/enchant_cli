Xu Xiangning let out a soft laugh, concealing her true emotions before sitting on the chair beside Old Lady Xu.

"Enough," said Old Lady Xu, "don't you know me by now? Did you find another new target?"

Old Lady Xu continued to feign ignorance, adding, "This is trivial—just go to the treasury and take the money yourself."

At this point, Old Lady Xu was clearly trying to dismiss Xu Xiangning. However, Xu Xiangning remained unaware that Old Lady Xu had already deduced her true intentions. She still naively believed that Old Lady Xu regarded her as usual—someone who only took without giving anything in return.

She felt a pang of委屈 (disappointment) but knew that, given Old Lady Xu's status, she could never truly anger her or dare to provoke her.

Moreover, Xu Xiangning understood that Old Lady Xu always used such words to drive her away, not wanting to be troubled.

So she quickly spoke: "No, Mother! I didn't come here to ask for these things. I have something important to tell you!"

After saying this, Xu Xiangning stared at Old Lady Xu with urgency, as if begging her to believe.

"Important matters?"

Old Lady Xu had long known why Xu Xiangning had come, but she still feigned ignorance.

She then said to Xu Xiangning with a hint of amusement, "You actually have important matters for me? Speak up—what is it?"

Xu Xiangning felt belittled. Her hands clenched anxiously, but she soon understood—after all, she had previously done nothing for the Xu family.

Still, she felt a twinge of sadness that Old Lady Xu thought so little of her. But now was not the time to dwell on it.

Chapter 844: Eager to Prove Oneself

She decided there was no time to waste. "Mother, you're investigating the person who killed Wu Chuan, right?"

The person Xu Xiangning referred to was Su Nantian. "I've found out where he is!"

Xu Xiangning hurriedly informed Old Lady Xu, her eyes brimming with urgency.

"Oh? You've already found him?"

Old Lady Xu feigned surprise, looking at Xu Xiangning with curiosity. "It's commendable that you care so much about your son. No wonder you're so preoccupied."

Old Lady Xu's words carried an unmistakable undertone of mockery. It was as if she implied that, had it not been for Wu Chuan's death, she would have ignored the matter entirely.

Xu Xiangning failed to detect the sarcasm and grew even more excited.

She desperately wanted to prove herself in Old Lady Xu's eyes, so she quickly added, "Yes! Mother, I've found him. And since he killed my son, I'll never let him escape!"

She emphasized the last part as if genuinely concerned for Wu Chuan. Yet, anyone could see her sincerity was questionable—after all, she had never visited Wu Chuan during his life or maintained any connection with him. This so-called maternal love seemed cheap and laughable.

But Old Lady Xu did not expose her. Instead, she continued with a calm inquiry: "You said you found him—where is he now?"

"Actually, I've only narrowed it down to a general area. But trust me, give me more time and I'll find him!"

Xu Xiangning felt a twinge of embarrassment. She had spoken too hastily, revealing only a few locations where he might be without certainty. If pressed further, she had no solid evidence to back her claims.

"Ah, you said you'd already found him," Old Lady Xu remarked. She knew that Master Hong would never entrust such a crucial secret to Xu Xiangning. Moreover, she had already suspected that Master Hong had only shared trivial details with her—enough for a fool like Xu Xiangning to believe and rush to boast.

As she thought this, Old Lady Xu sighed inwardly. She wondered whose traits her daughter had inherited—unable to discern truth from falsehood.

If this became known, others would surely mock the Xu family!

"No, I haven't found him yet. But I've narrowed it down to these five rivers," Xu Xiangning replied, her face flushed with embarrassment.

Old Lady Xu merely nodded. "I'll send people to search those areas."

She showed no surprise, for their own agents had already discovered the five rivers. Yet she hadn't expected Master Hong to be so stingy, sharing only insignificant clues with Xu Xiangning.

Xu Xiangning, however, treated these scraps as treasures and rushed to inform her.

At that moment, Xu Xiangning was stunned. She had expected Old Lady Xu to be delighted and praise her for the news. But she never anticipated such a calm, unimpressed reaction.

"Mother," she hesitated but asked, "have you already known about this?"

Old Lady Xu glanced at her. "Yes. But it's commendable that you took the initiative."

With that, she waved her hand dismissively, signaling Xu Xiangning to leave. She clearly had no more patience for this charade.

Old Lady Xu had only indulged in these games because she'd felt generous that day. But now, seeing Xu Xiangning's lack of value, she was tired and had no desire to continue.

"Mother?"

Xu Xiangning couldn't believe Old Lady Xu had so easily dismissed her clues. This was the result of her hard work, yet it seemed utterly worthless to her mother.

She grew anxious again, trying to persuade Old Lady Xu and prove herself. At the same time, she cursed Master Hong in her heart for being a useless show-off. She had waited so long, only to receive such meaningless information.

After this, she resolved to confront Master Hong and demand an explanation.

Old Lady Xu's direct admission was meant as a warning: if Xu Xiangning remained so foolish, allowing Master Hong to manipulate her like a pawn or tool, she could do nothing.

"Leave," Old Lady Xu ordered again, her voice firm and unyielding. Her long years at the top had earned her authority, and as the head of the Xu family, she commanded respect.

Xu Xiangning dared not resist and left reluctantly.

When she stepped out of Old Lady Xu's room, she stomped her foot in frustration. She had come with high hopes to inform Old Lady Xu, only for the latter to already know and treat her as foolish.

This thought filled her with anger. She wondered if Master Hong had intentionally misled her, giving such worthless information.

Chapter 845: Foolishness

After clarifying this, Xu Xiangning immediately grabbed her bag and rushed to find Master Hong to settle the score. She wanted to confront him directly and demand an explanation.

Unbeknownst to her, Old Lady Xu was watching her impulsive actions through the surveillance system.

Old Lady Xu sighed helplessly, knowing that even if Xu Xiangning confronted Master Hong, he would likely deceive her with a few words and brush it off.

After this thought, Old Lady Xu decided she had given up on Xu Xiangning entirely to prevent her from causing more trouble.

But for now, she would let her act foolishly—so long as it wasn't a major issue, the Xu family could handle it and ensure no one looked down on Xu Xiangning.

The Xu family was bustling with unrest, while Su Nantian in the small fishing village had already packed his belongings and prepared to leave.

He decided to find Master Hong and demand answers—first, to settle the score and understand why Master Hong had sought him out. Second, to uncover his true identity.

He reasoned that since Master Hong had gone through so much trouble to find him, he must know something about his past.

After this realization, Su Nantian wasted no time and hurried to investigate.

"Uncle Wang, thank you for taking care of me these past days," Su Nantian said as he bid farewell to Uncle Wang.

As for the other villagers of the small fishing village, he chose not to disturb them. It was late at night, and so much had already happened—Su Nantian wanted them to rest.

"Why not wait until morning?" Uncle Wang asked, his voice tinged with reluctance as he watched Su Nantian. He seemed to have much to say but held it back.

"Leaving now is the same as leaving tomorrow," Su Nantian replied, then added, "Uncle Wang, don't worry. Once I've resolved the matters outside, I'll return to bother you again. Don't fear for my safety."

As he said this, Su Nantian smiled at Uncle Wang to ease his concerns. "Besides, you know that few could harm me."

This was not arrogance or boasting but a way to reassure Uncle Wang. He didn't want him to worry endlessly.

"I believe in your abilities," Uncle Wang said slowly, knowing that Su Nantian's strength made it unlikely anyone could harm him.

Yet they were still worried—worried that Su Nantian might face danger or trouble alone. That was why they kept urging him to be careful.

"Uncle, are you leaving?" Xiao Wang asked, though he was already asleep. Somehow, he had woken up and overheard Uncle Wang and Su Nantian's conversation.

He jumped off his bed, hugging Su Nantian's legs: "Uncle, can't you stay?"

Xiao Wang pleaded with a desperate tone. His childish voice and longing gaze made Su Nantian's heart ache.

But Su Nantian understood that if the hidden dangers outside weren't resolved quickly, they would bring destruction to the small fishing village. He couldn't let emotions hinder his duty.

After this realization, he could no longer stay: "Xiao Wang, be good and listen to Uncle Wang. I'll return as soon as I've settled things, okay?"

After saying this, Su Nantian gently patted Xiao Wang's head.

Xiao Wang was usually the most obedient child, always obeying Su Nantian's words. But that night, he had become defiant because he didn't want his uncle to leave.

Though young, he understood people's feelings. Though he didn't know why his uncle had suddenly become someone else, he still loved him and couldn't bear to see him leave.

"Uncle, don't go! Uncle, please don't!" Xiao Wang repeated these words over and over, making the listeners feel heartbroken.

"Xiao Wang, be good and don't act spoiled. This time, your uncle is going to do something important," Uncle Wang said, stepping forward and pressing Xiao Wang's shoulders to stop his outburst.

Then he softened his voice, trying to soothe Xiao Wang and let Su Nantian go.

They hadn't expected Xiao Wang to suddenly wake up; otherwise, they wouldn’t have spoken in the room.

"I don't want to! You're all lying to me! Uncle will never come back!"

Xiao Wang, driven by some unknown determination, clung tightly to Su Nantian's legs and refused to let him go.

In truth, a single move from Su Nantian could have made Xiao Wang release him. But Su Nantian didn't want to hurt Xiao Wang or make him sad, so he hesitated and didn’t know what to do.

Uncle Wang was also at a loss, unable to handle Xiao Wang's behavior.

They remained in this stalemate for a while, the atmosphere growing increasingly silent. At that moment, Su Nantian seemed to have an idea. He crouched down and stared directly into Xiao Wang's eyes.

Su Nantian looked at Xiao Wang seriously, then said: "Xiao Wang, I promise to keep my word. Trust me."

He spoke each word carefully and earnestly.

Xiao Wang had initially been unsure how to face Su Nantian or believe his words, but at that moment, he seemed to understand what Su Nantian meant.

"Uncle, will you really come back?" Xiao Wang asked softly, his voice cautious and anxious.

"Yes, I will," Su Nantian replied immediately, earnestly, with no hint of insincerity.

Uncle Wang also crouched down to be level with Xiao Wang and comforted him: "You uncle will come back. Trust me, Grandpa."

He knew this child was sentimental but hadn’t expected him to care so much.

"I don't want to! You all lied to me! You said my parents would come back, but I've never seen them!"

Chapter 846: Farewell

"You're lying to me! You're lying to me!"

Xiao Wang suddenly remembered this and spoke with a sense of委屈 (disappointment), his voice rising as he finished, unable to hold back his excitement.

Xiao Wang's face turned red with anger and he pouted, turning away as if not wanting to see Uncle Wang.

"Hmph!"

Xiao Wang let out a cold snort, his pride wounded.

"What..."

Uncle Wang was taken aback, his face showing a painful expression. He bit his lips and suppressed the pain but didn’t know what to say.

At this moment, Su Nantian also glanced at Uncle Wang. He had lived there for over a month but still hadn’t met Xiao Wang’s parents or heard anything about them.

Now, seeing Uncle Wang's expression, Su Nantian seemed to suddenly understand something. He was an adult, different from Xiao Wang, and could read Uncle Wang's expression clearly.

Xiao Wang’s parents hadn’t returned—likely dead. And Uncle Wang had kept this secret to protect Xiao Wang from worry.

"Uncle promises you, I won’t leave," Su Nantian interrupted their conversation and extended his finger to Xiao Wang: "Come on, make a pinky promise. I won’t lie to you."

Xiao Wang was initially stunned, then smiled through his tears. He slowly extended his little finger and linked it with Su Nantian’s: "Then Uncle must remember your promise. You can't lie to me!"

"I won’t," Su Nantian replied, nodding. Though it was just three simple words, they represented his promise and sincerity. He would never deceive Xiao Wang.

They soon calmed Xiao Wang down, and Su Nantian decided not to waste more time. He quickly packed his belongings and prepared to leave.

Originally, Su Nantian didn’t want Uncle Wang and Xiao Wang to accompany him out, but they insisted so much that he couldn't refuse. Moreover, Uncle Wang said he didn’t know when he would return and wanted to see him off as far as possible.

After hearing this, Su Nantian had no choice but to agree and let them accompany him.

"Alright, that's far enough."

Su Nantian stopped at the village entrance and told them to go back: "You should return quickly. It's dark, and the path is dangerous."

Uncle Wang didn’t leave immediately but stared at Su Nantian with reluctance, holding his hand as if he were an elder sending off a younger one.

Every word he spoke was heartfelt and full of concern: "Although I know your abilities, take care of yourself, okay?"

When Su Nantian heard this, his heart warmed. He knew Uncle Wang had already treated him as a younger relative. So he replied without any pretense.

"Uncle Wang, don’t worry. I’ll take care of myself. Wait for my good news."

At that moment, Su Nantian and Uncle Wang had no idea this parting would be eternal. Nor did Su Nantian know that leaving for just a short time would bring such a big change to the small fishing village.

Unfortunately, no one had the ability to foresee the future; otherwise, Su Nantian would never have left the small fishing village even a step.

After talking with Uncle Wang for a while, he was given more叮嘱 (admonitions) to be careful and stay safe.

At that moment, they heard some noise behind them, and faint lights flickered in the distance.

Su Nantian was taken aback at first, instinctively shielding Uncle Wang and Xiao Wang behind him. His expression turned serious.

Who could it be at this time?

But soon, Su Nantian’s serious expression eased and returned to his usual calmness.

It turned out the noise was from the villagers of the small fishing village, who were carrying flashlights and some even held oil lamps. They came in a large group.

Even injured Xiao Chen was supported by his sister and other villagers, walking step by step toward them.

"Big Brother Tian!"

Xiao Chen saw Su Nantian and waved enthusiastically, then smiled brightly. The villagers also all showed their happiest expressions.

"You..."

Su Nantian was stunned, surprised by the scene before him. He hadn’t expected the villagers to come and see him off.

Master Hong had thought his departure was seamless, but the villagers had already guessed and came to see him off.

This sentiment deeply moved Su Nantian.

He saw many familiar faces, including the trembling village head and other villagers. Every face was one he knew well.

After seeing this, Su Nantian felt his heart warm up.

He also made up his mind that after completing his tasks, he would return to find Master Hong and uncover his identity. He would definitely come back and never break his promise.

At that time, he would stay in the small fishing village to protect these villagers and ensure they suffered no harm.

"You should go back!"

Su Nantian clenched his hands tightly and composed his expression. He knew that in such a farewell scene, he should be happy. Otherwise, others would start crying.

"Go back quickly!"

It was still late at night, and the small fishing village was located on a mountain with low temperatures. Su Nantian didn’t want the villagers to stay any longer.

"Big Brother Tian," Xiao Chen said, his expression hesitant.

After learning Su Nantian’s real name, they had changed their称呼 (title) from "Big Brother Li" to the current "Big Brother Tian."

"Yes?"

Su Nantian raised an eyebrow, looking at Xiao Chen questioningly.

"Will you come back?"

Xiao Chen hesitated for a moment but finally asked this question.

The other villagers, hearing Xiao Chen's question, also looked at Su Nantian eagerly. Clearly, this was something they were all concerned about.

But no one dared to ask directly, fearing an answer they didn’t want.

Su Nantian didn’t reply immediately but stared at Xiao Chen for a moment, then looked around at the villagers. His gaze lingered on each of them for one second.

Then, with a determined tone, he replied: "Of course I will."

Chapter 847: Departure

"You should all go back!"

Su Nantian smiled and said to everyone, asking them not to see him off. After giving a few instructions, he turned and left quickly.

He was worried that if he looked back too long, he would be reluctant to leave. So he left as fast as possible.

Because he feared that if he stayed longer, he would be tempted by the warmth of this place—especially the warmth from Uncle Wang and Xiao Wang—and wouldn’t want to leave.

But his reason told him that if he didn’t eliminate Master Hong quickly, it would bring endless disasters.

Moreover, Su Nantian was very curious about his true identity. He wanted to find out what kind of identity he had, why Master Hong in M City went through so much trouble to send many people to find him, as if he had some important role.

So to uncover these mysteries, Su Nantian wanted to leave quickly and find Master Hong as soon as possible.

Once he resolved these troubles, he would return to the small fishing village and live with these villagers.

Su Nantian also made a promise in his heart that he would take good care of the villagers of the small fishing village and ensure they suffered no harm.

Unfortunately, Su Nantian had forgotten that in this world, there are so few dreams come true. More often than not, it's about unexpected disasters and misfortunes. Everyone is the same—no one knows whether tomorrow or an accident will come first.

But at that moment, Su Nantian didn’t think about these things. He only wanted to quickly deal with Master Hong and then return to live with the villagers of the small fishing village.

After saying goodbye to the villagers, Su Nantian immediately set off without any delay.

He had already learned from Long Ge and A Chuan the exact address of Master Hong, so this journey was purposeful.

Su Nantian didn’t rest or stop for long on the way.

Moreover, he didn’t know why, but he felt a huge amount of energy inside his body, as if it would never run out.

So no matter how many days he traveled without stopping or resting, even if he didn’t eat to replenish his energy, he felt no fatigue and never ran out of strength.

Moreover, Su Nantian felt that he didn’t get tired at all. He kept traveling quickly and used a fast pace to leave the remote small village and arrive in the city.

Su Nantian first went to a small shop to buy a map and marked Master Hong’s address on it.

His eyes turned deep, staring at the location he had marked.

This was where Master Hong was.

It was also the address of the local tyrant mentioned by Long Ge and A Chuan.

But no matter what, Su Nantian would never back down. He would make them realize quickly that he had no fear and wouldn’t be intimidated by them.

What was a local tyrant?

Anyone who threatened the small fishing village or had bad intentions toward him, Su Nantian would kill them one by one.

He would make them disappear without a trace, so they could no longer oppose him or dare to bother him. More importantly, they would never dare to disturb the peaceful life of the small fishing village.

After thinking this through, Su Nantian’s gaze deepened further. He slowly raised his head and looked at the cloudless sky.

At this moment, his lips curled slightly, and he placed his finger on the marked location on the map. Soon, this map had a hole punched through it—exactly at Master Hong’s address.

This action showed Su Nantian's determination to eliminate Master Hong.

Once he found Master Hong, it would be time to uncover his origins.

Su Nantian knew this day was not far off.

As for what would happen when they met, whether Master Hong would regret his decision to provoke him—this didn’t need Su Nantian to think about or worry.

Because Su Nantian knew that when Master Hong saw him, he would definitely regret it.

He shouldn’t have sent people to disturb the peaceful life of the small fishing village.

On the other hand, Xu Xiangning was thinking about how she had embarrassed herself in front of Old Lady Xu. She felt even more委屈 (disappointed).

Her answer, which she had boasted about, was just a trivial piece of information. Worse still, it was something Old Lady Xu and the others had already discovered. This made her feel even more ashamed.

She had intended to make her mother and brother look at her differently, but instead of surprising them, they had mocked her.

So Xu Xiangning immediately set out without delay, determined to confront Master Hong and demand a satisfactory explanation.

"Master Hong, it's Xu Xiangning."

The butler respectfully approached Master Hong and informed him.

Normally, there was no need to inform Master Hong, but recently he had specifically announced that if Xu Xiangning came again, they should first inform him and decide whether to let her in.

So the butler naturally came to ask Master Hong’s opinion. If he refused, they would think of several excuses to send Xu Xiangning away.

In short, they would never let her meet Master Hong or disturb him.

"Oh, it's her," this surprised Master Hong.

He had expected that after receiving his answer, Xu Xiangning would take a few days off and not bother him again.

But he hadn’t expected her to come so quickly.

She was really eager!

However, Master Hong had some information he wanted to obtain from Xu Xiangning, so he waved his hand and told the butler: "Let her in."

"Master Hong, you're really busy. Now even coming to see you requires an introduction," Xu Xiangning said as she entered, giving Master Hong a reproachful look and speaking with dissatisfaction.

She felt that Master Hong was no longer as attentive to her as before. She used to be able to enter without any introduction, but now she had waited for several minutes outside!

Xu Xiangning's personality was always like this—she wanted the best of everything, and no one could stop her. So now that Master Hong was treating her so dismissively, she immediately felt dissatisfied.

She spoke in a flirtatious way, but her intention was clearly to demand an explanation from Master Hong.

Chapter 848: Each with Their Own Troubles

"You're asking for too much! You've been so cold to me these days!"

Xu Xiangning continued to flirt, determined to get an answer from Master Hong and persuade him.

"What a busy person! These affairs are more important than you, right? I pushed everything aside just to see you. Now you're saying I've been ignoring you?"

Master Hong deflected, then grabbed Xu Xiangning's wrist and pulled her forward. She lost her balance and fell into his arms.

Master Hong looked down at Xu Xiangning in his arms and said, "But you're the one who's been busy. Tell me how many times you've come to see me these days? And how many of those visits were truly for just seeing me?"

Master Hong struck first, silencing Xu Xiangning.

Xu Xiangning was indeed distracted and didn’t know how to explain to Master Hong, since she had approached him for two reasons: first, to gain some abilities, and second, to show off her charm.

"You're blaming me? I didn't come to bother you because I knew you were busy," she said.

"Ugh, you're just making a big deal out of nothing. I don't want to hear it!"

Xu Xiangning's words were harsh, but they sounded more like a couple’s playful teasing than a real threat.

Master Hong understood the hidden meaning in Xu Xiangning's words and didn’t take it seriously.

"Speak up—what do you want?"

Master Hong directly posed the condition, appearing generous as if he truly wanted to please Xu Xiangning.

Hearing Master Hong's approach, and his continued care for her, Xu Xiangning’s anger from Old Lady Xu was largely dispelled. She also found excuses for Master Hong in her heart.

She knew Master Hong's background and the strength of their family, so she understood that the Xu family’s power was vast—like a big tree with roots spread everywhere. It was easy for them to uncover such information.

But Master Hong was merely a local tyrant who had climbed from the bottom. Though he had great intimidation among ordinary people, to families like the Xu family, he was just a small fry that didn’t deserve attention.

So Xu Xiangning felt that Master Hong must have put in a lot of effort to help her.

Moreover, the people who had informed her that Master Hong was issuing orders and prioritizing her matters over others had said so.

Just this special treatment made Xu Xiangning feel she shouldn’t be angry anymore.

"I don't need anything, do I?" Xu Xiangning gave Master Hong a reproachful look and placed her hands on his shoulders, gently massaging them.

At this point, she continued: "You know perfectly well that my only wish is to find out where the person who killed Wu Chuan is."

"Relax, that kid won’t escape. I’ll find him soon," Master Hong said without deliberately teasing her.

Master Hong was well-versed in how to comfort people like Xu Xiangning, so he knew that if she had come to see him, pushing her away would only make her upset.

Therefore, he changed his approach and didn’t tell her to wait for news as before.

"I’ve already sent many people out to investigate, and it seems we've narrowed down his location. Once I confirm it, I’ll let you know immediately. Rest assured, I'll always care about your matters," Master Hong said and then touched Xu Xiangning's face affectionately.

Xu Xiangning feigned shyness and gave Master Hong a reproachful look, but she remained close to him, allowing Master Hong to touch her freely.

Not only that, but she leaned against his body and became more intimate with him.

She was fully confident in her charm, and she had already found excuses for Master Hong when she arrived.

So now that Master Hong was cooperating with her and giving a promise immediately without any excuses, she felt even more satisfied with him.

She believed that Master Hong would definitely work hard to find Su Nantian for her.

Therefore, she didn’t need to urge him again—just wait patiently for the news.
