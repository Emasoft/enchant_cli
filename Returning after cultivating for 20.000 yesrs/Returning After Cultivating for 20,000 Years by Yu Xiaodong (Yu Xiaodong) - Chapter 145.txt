Wu Chuan saw Wu You'er still boldly asserting this demand, and coldly threw out four words without giving her a second thought.

Moreover, even if one used their fingers to think, it would be clear that Wu Chuan would never let Wu You'er leave.

He had never been someone who spoke kindly!

Furthermore, after Wu Tao and his wife had provoked him, they had left such a massive trouble for him. Wu Chuan could not even vent his anger on them, and now the only remaining member of their family was Wu You'er. Before he had fully vented his anger, how could he possibly let go of Wu You'er?

That was why he had said that Wu You'er was merely dreaming, and that he would never let her go. Wu You'er had better not even have such a thought!

"Hmph, be ready for this decision. You will stay in the Wu family forever!"

After thinking of this, Wu Chuan spoke even more angrily to Wu You'er. When he said these words, he smiled cruelly again: "Do you still want to leave? Don't be so naive!"

He would never let Wu You'er escape easily!

After hearing Wu Chuan's words, Wu You'er immediately froze. She stared blankly at Wu Chuan with a dazed expression: "What did you say?"

She had never imagined that Wu Chuan would have such a cruel idea, to imprison her forever!

"Wu Chuan! Why are you doing this to me? Why do you keep imprisoning me?"

Wu You'er could no longer contain her emotions. She shouted at Wu Chuan with anger: "You had decided to be the family head already! Why won't you let us go? What are you trying to do?"

At this moment, Wu You'er was also unable to control her excitement. Her tightly clenched hands were now even tighter.

She truly did not understand what pleasure Wu Chuan found in keeping their entire family imprisoned!

And Wu You'er did not want to be a prisoner at all!

She believed that no one in this world would like being locked up forever, unless they were a fool!

"Why do you have to torment us like this?"

Wu You'er continued to angrily question Wu Chuan, unable to comprehend why he was targeting them. After all, the Wu family no longer needed them now, nor did they need her as a facade. Yet Wu Chuan still insisted on keeping her imprisoned. What kind of injustice was this?

"What benefit does this bring you?"

The more Wu You'er thought about it, the worse her expression became. Her chest heaved violently as if she were about to explode.

"Why?"

Wu You'er felt her anger boiling over, demanding an answer from Wu Chuan that could convince her.

Moreover, Wu You'er truly did not understand why Wu Chuan had gone through such a long route just to capture their family.

"Why?"

When Wu Chuan heard Wu You'er's words, he suddenly smiled with a mocking expression.

"Do I need a reason to torment someone? I simply dislike you, what do you think?"

At this moment, Wu Chuan provocatively spoke. His words were the epitome of a scoundrel.

And as he said this, he looked at Wu You'er with a mocking gaze. It was truly infuriating.

"I'm just bored, so I caught you all to amuse myself."

Wu Chuan continued speaking. Each of his words was like a sharp knife, cruelly stabbing into Wu You'er's heart.

Seeing this, Wu You'er was so angry she could not speak. Her face turned red, and she stared at Wu Chuan with a death glare, unable to utter a single word.

Wu Chuan was a scoundrel!

Someone like Wu You'er, who had just stepped into the world, could never outwit him. And Wu Chuan was an old fox who always calculated others without ever being outwitted. Wu You'er had no chance of dealing with Wu Chuan at all.

Thinking about this, Wu You'er became even angrier.

Did she have to be under Wu Chuan's control forever, never able to resist?

Or would she have to continue silently endure Wu Chuan's bullying for the rest of her life?

The more Wu You'er thought about these possibilities, the worse her complexion became. Her face turned paler and paler, looking pitiful. But at this moment, no one would feel sorry for her.

Especially since the person standing before her was the very demon who had imposed pressure on her, and Wu Chuan would never consider her feelings.

"You will never escape."

Wu Chuan seemed to have read Wu You'er's thoughts. He coldly smiled again and then spoke this cruel truth.

He had already prepared himself. He would make Wu You'er pay and bear the anger left behind by Wu Tao and his wife. After all, they had dared to provoke him with such foolishness.

And after provoking him, they chose to commit suicide, leaving Wu Chuan with no outlet for his anger.

So he would make the living suffer this wrath instead.

This was entirely Wu Tao and his wife's own doing, and had nothing to do with him!

"Oh, by the way."

At this moment, Wu Chuan suddenly spoke again. His voice was cold and indifferent, making people shiver down their spines, even causing their hair to stand on end.

Wu Chuan noticed Wu You'er's vigilance towards him, but he did not care. On the contrary, the more afraid she was of him, the more satisfied he felt.

"Whether or not you tell me who that man is, I will find him anyway. You know my abilities; there's no need to doubt them."

Wu Chuan smiled ominously again, and his gaze toward Wu You'er turned sinister: "When I find him, I will place him before you and carve his flesh piece by piece, letting you watch him suffer."

And it would be a watching that left her powerless to save him.

As he spoke, the curve of his lips became even more sinister.

He still felt it was not enough to torment Wu You'er, so he continued:

"When you watch him, don't blink."

Wu Chuan raised his eyebrows and first looked at Wu You'er before continuing with a cold tone, making this cruel decision.

He would definitely teach that boy a harsh lessonâ€”first for concealing him, and second because this man had dared to enter the Wu family alone. That was a blatant provocation, and how could Wu Chuan tolerate it?

Hearing this, Wu You'er took a step back. Her face became even paler, and her lips were equally pale.

At this moment, she felt as if someone had choked her throat, unable to make a sound.

Seeing Wu You'er in such a state, Wu Chuan smiled coldly again and then satisfiedly withdrew his gaze. He then ordered the assistant standing beside him: "Amu, gather all security personnel. No matter what, we must find the man who entered tonight!"

He would not allow this person to challenge his authority on his territory.

"Yes, sir."

Li Assistant had not dared to speak a word before, especially considering the many events that had occurred in this short night. Li Assistant felt even more cautious now.

After hearing Wu Chuan's order, Li Assistant immediately respectfully looked at Wu Chuan, fearing that he would be punished for any negligence.

"Also,"
Wu Chuan continued coldly: "Take her to a new place. Remember, this time prepare a more secure location. I want to lock her in a place where even flies cannot enter."

After saying this, Wu Chuan cast another cold glance at Wu You'er.

He had underestimated this man, who had directly broken through his walls. But the next time he would not let him get away so easily.

He would prepare a fortress of iron and copper, then see if this person had three heads and six arms to succeed!

Thinking about this, Wu Chuan smiled coldly again.

He was also quite eager to meet this person now. After all, he had never met anyone who dared to repeatedly provoke his dignity!

"Yes, sir!"
Li Assistant responded quickly again. His mind was already beginning to calculate where he should place Wu You'er.

He had to handle this carefully; if he failed again and allowed the mysterious intruder to find Wu You'er, not only would Wu Chuan be angry, but he himself might lose his life.

Thinking about this, Li Assistant's expression became even more solemn and he did not dare to waste any time.

"Wu Chuan, you are a despicable creature! You cannot imprison me or find him. This has nothing to do with him; it's our conflict! If you have anger, take it out on me!"

Wu You'er had now regained her composure. Especially when she heard Wu Chuan was going to find Su Nantian, her heart immediately gave a jolt.

Wu You'er believed that with Wu Chuan's abilities, he could indeed find Su Nantian.

And because of this reason, she was even more worried that Su Nantian would be caught in the crossfire. Therefore, Wu You'er could not maintain her usual composure.

She began to curse Wu Chuan without restraint, interrupting Wu Chuan's decision with indignation: "You cannot do this! This has nothing to do with him!"

Even in this urgent moment, Wu You'er did not slip up or reveal Su Nantian's name.

She tightly clenched her fists, and the expression on her face and eyes were resolute.

"Haha."
Wu Chuan's favorite thing was to see Wu You'er being crushed by him yet powerless to resist. This allowed him to vent his anger towards Wu Tao and his wife.

So when he saw Wu You'er being devastated by his words, Wu Chuan's mood immediately improved.

"I cannot do this?"
Wu Chuan sneered: "You are the first person who dared to interfere with my actions."

After saying this, he sneered again and continued cruelly: "But it's a pity that the more you care about him, the more I want to find him."

This was the truth. He loved seeing Wu You'er constantly struggling yet powerless.

He felt his mood improved immediately, and his gaze toward Wu You'er became even more cruelly triumphant.

"You!"
When Wu You'er heard Wu Chuan's words, she knew he was deliberately opposing her.

But at this moment, all she could do was worry and could not argue back against Wu Chuan. She could not stop Wu Chuan either.

Wu You'er had always understood that Wu Chuan was selfish and stubborn, and once he made a decision, no one could interfere.

And the most annoying thing about Wu Chuan was that he loved watching others struggle. The more desperate she became, the happier Wu Chuan felt.

Indeed, Wu Chuan's face was now quite good, having recovered his usual expression.

And at this moment, his gaze toward Wu You'er was like a hunter who had found their beloved prey, not allowing her to escape.

"Take her away and settle her properly."
Wu Chuan spoke ominously, giving Li Assistant a command.

When Wu You'er was helplessly dragged away by Li Assistant, Wu Chuan's mood became even better.

He decided to catch this man that Wu You'er valued so much and then cruelly torment him in front of her.

Wu Chuan had also discovered something quite good at this moment.

Because Wu Tao and his wife had died unexpectedly, Wu Chuan was still troubled about how to control Wu You'er and get her to comply. But now, a new substitute had immediately appeared.

Wu Chuan had clearly seen that Wu You'er was very concerned about this man.

But after thinking it over, he confirmed that since the other person had risked great danger to enter the Wu family alone, it was only because of deep feelings that he would come to save Wu You'er.

No matter how deep their relationship was, Wu Chuan had already decided to personally torment these two people, making them regret for the rest of their lives for offending him!

Thinking about what would happen next, Wu Chuan smiled contentedly with a meaningful expression.

"Sir, Miss Wu You'er has been settled."
At this moment, Li Assistant quickly entered again. He first carefully observed Wu Chuan's expression before speaking softly: "She has been placed in the safe room of the eastern courtyard."

This was a place Wu Chuan had specially built, impenetrable and unbreakable. It met the condition of not allowing even a fly to enter.

"I have also arranged three times the number of people to guard her, and there will be no more incidents tonight."
Li Assistant continued respectfully, striving to please Wu Chuan.

Chapter 727: Imprisoned

"Good, very good."
After hearing Li Assistant's words, Wu Chuan nodded in satisfaction and said: "You did well."

After praising Li Assistant, Wu Chuan continued: "Remember, there must be no more incidents this time. Watch her carefully."

This was an important bait for his fishing, and he could not afford any more accidents.

Moreover, Wu You'er was the last remaining descendant of the Wu family. Before he had fully vented his anger, there was no way he would let her go.

After thinking about this, Wu Chuan's expression became even more playful.

He had finally found a fun little toy and would not let it escape so easily. Besides, Wu You'er could bring him an even more interesting person.

Wu Chuan was already impatient to meet the one who had dared to come alone to save Wu You'er. He truly wanted to see what kind of person he was, then cruelly teach him a lesson so that he would regret for the rest of his life and never dare to provoke him again.

On the other hand, Wu You'er had been locked up in a very secure cage.

This was truly an impregnable fortress, where no living being could escape or enter.

And it was completely airtight, with only one small vent for air, and no other way out.

Li Assistant had decided to lock her here because she had caused him so much trouble and had made Wu Chuan reprimand him multiple times.

Moreover, the security personnel had been increased several times over.

This time, they were working in twenty-four-hour shifts with strict surveillance. Even during shift changes, a third team would be on duty to ensure no one could approach this place.

Li Assistant was also worried about the possibility of a recurrence, like Su Nantian pretending to be a security guard to deliver meals and approach Wu You'er.

So this time, Li Assistant decided to take on the responsibility himself, delivering meals three times a day. This way, there would be no loopholes for the other person to exploit.

Moreover, Li Assistant had made it clear to everyone that no one else except himself could enter, regardless of the excuses they gave.

These security personnel had already been in disgrace for their previous mistake, so how could they dare to disobey Li Assistant's orders? They all immediately nodded and assured him that they understood and would remember it.

After seeing this, Li Assistant gave a few more instructions: "You must guard her carefully. If there is another incident, even I cannot protect you!"

"Li Assistant, rest assured! We will definitely be careful this time!"
The security personnel immediately answered Li Assistant and quickly made their promise.

After seeing this, Li Assistant left satisfied.

But after he left, there were still other problems.

After being locked up, Wu You'er continued to curse and swear at Wu Chuan, constantly yelling and making noise to attract attention from outside.

"Wu Chuan! You bastard! Let me out! Let me out!"
Wu You'er kept shouting loudly until her voice was hoarse and she did not stop.

Her voice echoed all the way outside through this cage.

Because her voice was hoarse and it was already midnight, it sounded like a ghostly wail. This made the security personnel guarding the door shiver involuntarily.

"What's wrong with Miss Wu You'er?"
"Exactly, she keeps howling like a ghost. What should we do about it?"

The security personnel guarding the door were so tormented by Wu You'er's constant noise that they could no longer endure it. They had been silently suffering for a long time and finally could not bear it anymore.

They all looked troubled, and immediately complained with expressions of unbearable pain, as if they could not find the right words.

"Wu Chuan! You won't get a good death! Let me out! Let me out!"
At this moment, Wu You'er continued to shout loudly and curse Wu Chuan. Her words were one after another more insulting.

This made the security personnel at the door completely helpless.

"This is no good!"
One of the security personnel rubbed his head, looking troubled: "If Miss Wu You'er continues to cause trouble like this, it's not a solution!"

"Exactly! She won't stop talking. It's really annoying!"
Another security personnel also showed a troubled expression, not knowing what to do.

"Hey! Wait!"
At this moment, one of the security personnel slapped his head and suddenly thought of a solution. He immediately turned to the others and said: "We can't control Miss Wu You'er, but there's someone who can!"

After saying this, they all first hesitated and then nodded immediately: "Right! There's still Li Assistant!"

"Exactly!"
They all spoke in unison and nodded: "Hurry up and tell Li Assistant! Only he can solve this problem!"

After saying this, they did not dare to delay and immediately sent a representative to inform Li Assistant. They put all their hopes on Li Assistant, hoping he would have a way to deal with the constantly noisy Wu You'er.

At the same time, Li Assistant had returned to his room and was preparing to rest.

He lay in bed, recalling the several events that had happened today. Thinking about these shocking secrets, Li Assistant could not help but sigh deeply.

Moreover, Li Assistant thought that with so many things happening, Wu Chuan's mood would definitely not be good. And he was now serving under Wu Chuan's nose.

He must remain vigilant and strictly serve Wu Chuan in the future, absolutely not making any mistakes!

Li Assistant also thought about how many things had happened today but it had all been a close call. He immediately sighed in relief and slightly relaxed his mood.

But just as he had taken a deep breath, he heard the sound at the door again.

"What?"
Li Assistant quickly pulled back the blanket, sat up, and hurriedly opened his door. He thought about what he had just heard, and his face immediately turned dark: "Tell me clearly. What's going on!"

"Miss Wu You'er, since you returned, she has been causing trouble and making noise constantly. We can't bear it anymore and couldn't persuade her!"

Chapter 728: Further Troubles

"Li Assistant, we really have no choice but to disturb your peace."
The security personnel who came to report were like finally finding someone to vent their complaints, pouring out their grievances and complaining to Li Assistant.

"If we had a solution, we wouldn't have come to bother you."
After saying this, they also added a sentence to shift the blame and make Li Assistant not hold them responsible.

"What? What did she do this time!"
After hearing the security personnel's words, Li Assistant's face became even more gloomy. His expression was already dark and now turned as black as ink.

Li Assistant was really angry, and he felt that Wu You'er was deliberately trying to trouble him. He would be satisfied only if she made him angry!

"She has been cursing you."
The security personnel hesitated but finally told Li Assistant the truth and continued with a determined tone: "And Miss Wu You'er's words were quite insulting."

"Insulting? That's outrageous!"
Li Assistant frowned and furrowed his brows more deeply: "You don't need to bother with her. Let her keep shouting!"

Li Assistant scolded angrily and said: "I want to see how long she can keep this up!"

He really did not want to get involved, just to see what tricks Wu You'er had up her sleeve.

If she wanted to shout and curse, he would see how long her voice could last!

"No way, Li Assistant. We've been suffering for a long time! Everyone is in agony and we can't bear it anymore!"
The security personnel immediately told Li Assistant, then added: "Besides, even though there's no danger inside, we're worried that Miss Wu You'er might do something foolish. After all, these are iron walls and she could die by just bumping into them!"

The security personnel thought of this and immediately came to report to Li Assistant.

When Li Assistant thought about this, he also recalled the recent suicide of Wu Tao and his wife. He was immediately frightened and stood up quickly.

"Right!"
He could not let Wu You'er cause trouble again!

If this time Wu You'er also had an accident, Li Assistant did not need to think twice. He could already guess that Wu Chuan would strip his skin off.

After thinking about this, Li Assistant did not care about anything else. He quickly grabbed his coat and put it on, then told the security personnel: "Come on! Hurry up and go check!"

Li Assistant was now extremely worried about Wu You'er causing any more trouble.

The security personnel, who had no idea how to deal with Wu You'er, felt relieved when Li Assistant started handling this matter.

"Yes! Li Assistant!"
The security personnel immediately responded and quickly led the way for Li Assistant.

Then Li Assistant did not dare to delay, walking as fast as he could.

The security personnel guarding the door saw Li Assistant coming and felt like they had found a savior. They all immediately sighed in relief and quickly opened the door to let Li Assistant in.

"Li Assistant, please go see Miss Wu You'er! Her noise has become even more frequent!"
The security personnel, while opening the door, told Li Assistant about this situation.

"Yes, I know!"
After hearing the security personnel's words, Li Assistant nodded and waved them aside.

"Miss Wu You'er, what are you doing?"
Li Assistant pushed the door open and had not even seen Wu You'er yet, but he immediately said: "You are causing trouble like this. Who is suffering? You are the one who suffers!"

After saying this, he finally turned his gaze to Wu You'er.

"I want to cause trouble! If I don't, how would you come over?"
Wu You'er had been shouting for so long that she was almost exhausted. Her throat was dry and parched, but when she saw Li Assistant appear before her, she knew she had made the right move.

She immediately smiled happily and continued: "By the way, I want to see Wu Chuan. Bring him over!"

Wu You'er said this while looking at Li Assistant.

She knew that Li Assistant would not easily agree to her request, but she was not discouraged and immediately added: "If you don't let me see him, I will keep shouting until you all get tired of it!"

Wu You'er believed that since she was still useful to Wu Chuan, Li Assistant could not do anything to her.

After thinking about this, Wu You'er became even more fearless and urged Li Assistant again: "Hurry up and bring him over!"

Wu Chuan was not deliberately tormenting her, making her suffer?

Then she could do the same. She would return his actions to him and see who was more afraid!

Wu You'er clenched her fists, and after thinking about this, her expression became even more determined: "I must see Wu Chuan tonight!"

After saying this, her expression became even more resolute. She would not let Wu Chuan rest peacefully. As long as he did not free her, she would continue to cause trouble every day and never stop!

"Miss Wu You'er, what's the point of this? If you anger Wu Chuan, who will suffer? What are you trying to achieve?"
Li Assistant earnestly advised Wu You'er. He did not care about whether Wu You'er would be punished, but he was worried that she might involve him. That was why he advised her like this.

Wu You'er understood Li Assistant's reason, so she did not move an inch.

"You don't need to say anything else. I want to see him, otherwise I will not be quiet!"
Wu You'er understood this point. So she continued to threaten Li Assistant and her expression was very determined, showing a willingness to continue arguing with Li Assistant.

After saying this, Wu You'er put her hands over her ears, indicating she did not want to hear anything Li Assistant said.

"Miss Wu You'er, you..."
Li Assistant saw Wu You'er's stubbornness and his face became even more gloomy. He was at a loss for how to deal with Wu You'er.

If he went to fetch Wu Chuan, it would be like sending himself straight into his punishment. Li Assistant did not want to be scolded by him multiple times in one day, and who could withstand Wu Chuan's anger?

After thinking about this, Li Assistant became even more anxious and sighed helplessly.

Chapter 729: A Strategy

He was a little frustrated, walking back and forth in place.

At this moment, Wu You'er kept her hands over her ears but did not take her eyes off Li Assistant. She was always watching his condition.

So when she saw Li Assistant so troubled, Wu You'er felt more confident. Her heartbeat gradually calmed down and she was not as tense as before.

But Wu You'er did not expect that after walking a few steps, Li Assistant suddenly thought of a way to deal with her.

Li Assistant first stared at Wu You'er for a long time, then turned around and signaled to the security personnel with the same gloomy expression to come over.

Then Li Assistant whispered something in their ears.

The security personnel first showed a surprised expression and then asked Li Assistant: "Is it really necessary to do this, Li Assistant? Will there be any problems?"

"Yes, do as I told you."
Li Assistant nodded first and then added: "I will take responsibility for anything. Go ahead."

At this moment, Li Assistant gave the security personnel a reassuring word.

After receiving this assurance, the security personnel immediately nodded and hurried out.

Wu You'er saw Li Assistant's actions and immediately asked: "What are you planning to do? Li Assistant, don't act recklessly!"

And Wu You'er's heart gradually felt a strong sense of unease. She began to worry that Li Assistant might do something to her.

"Don't forget, I'm still useful to Wu Chuan. You can't do anything to me!"
Wu You'er immediately watched Li Assistant with suspicion and reminded him again.

At this moment, Wu You'er felt that Li Assistant also had some sinister intentions.

"Haha, don't worry, Miss Wu You'er. I know what I'm doing and won't hurt you."
At this moment, Li Assistant answered Wu You'er's question. He looked at her with a mysterious gaze but did not tell her what he was planning.

Soon, the security personnel Li Assistant had sent out returned.

He was holding a thick rope in his hand: "Li Assistant, the things you asked for are all prepared!"

When Wu You'er saw this, she immediately realized what Li Assistant was planning. She stared at him in shock: "So you wanted to tie me up!"

After saying this, Wu You'er stared at Li Assistant in shock. She had never expected that he would use such a strong method!

"This is not my fault. After all, Miss Wu You'er started the trouble and you wouldn't cooperate to stay quiet. So I can only fight fire with fire."
Li Assistant smiled ominously and looked at Wu You'er with a look of watching the show. He had no intention of showing mercy to Wu You'er at all.

"No! Li Assistant! You can't do this to me, you..."
Wu You'er stared at Li Assistant with wide eyes and looked shocked and bewildered. She had never expected that he would dare to tie her up!

And Li Assistant's eyes did not look like they were joking at all.

But at this moment, Li Assistant had no intention of answering Wu You'er. He directly waved his hand and signaled the security personnel: "Go, tie her up."

"Yes! Li Assistant!"
The security personnel naturally obeyed Li Assistant's orders. After all, they were also tired of Wu You'er's constant noise and now immediately went to tie her up.

Wu You'er was a weak woman with no strength, and how could she fight against two trained security personnel?

So after struggling a few times, she was tightly tied up and could not move at all.

"Let me go!"
Wu You'er struggled for a while, but the rope was still very tight and did not loosen. Wu You'er could not escape at all.

"Li Assistant! You can only tie me up for now, but do you think you can keep tying me forever?"
Wu You'er used all her strength, but she still could not break free. Her mood was at its lowest point. She then angrily shouted at Li Assistant:

"You can't do this to me!"
Seeing that Li Assistant did not want to answer her, Wu You'er continued to curse them. This time, even Li Assistant was included in the curses.

"You scum! Even if you tie me up, I will continue to curse you! I curse you! As long as I live one day, I won't let you have peace!"

Wu You'er was now completely desperate. She became even more angry and cursed: "You bunch of bastards!"

"Tsk tsk, you really are a big trouble."
Li Assistant did not care about Wu You'er's curses. He frowned slightly and said a sentence, then took out a handkerchief from his pocket.

"Never mind, I just need to make you quiet."
After saying this, Li Assistant directly put the handkerchief into Wu You'er's mouth.

"Ugh! Ugh!"
Wu You'er widened her eyes even more. She had never expected that Li Assistant would dare to be so bold, not only tying her up but also blocking her mouth and giving her no chance to speak!

She kept moving her tongue, trying to spit out the handkerchief in her mouth. But Li Assistant had thought of it more thoroughly. He signaled those security personnel to come over and then stuck a strip of tape around Wu You'er's mouth!

In this way, Wu You'er could not speak at all.

"Alright, you check on her regularly to make sure she's still alive. Other issues, you don't need to worry about."
At this moment, Li Assistant only wanted Wu You'er to be completely quiet and stop making noise.

After doing this, Li Assistant gave the security personnel a command.

Now that Wu You'er was still useful to Wu Chuan, but her value had not been as high before. So Li Assistant only needed to ensure that Wu You'er was still alive.

As for other issues, he did not have the good mood to serve Wu You'er: "Did you remember my words?"

Li Assistant turned his head and looked at the other security personnel.

"Remember! Li Assistant, rest assured we will check regularly and there won't be any problems!"
The security personnel immediately answered Li Assistant, then seriously looked at him.

After this, the security personnel felt relieved and thought they had finally found a way to deal with Wu You'er.

Chapter 730: Strict Surveillance

"Li Assistant, rest assured!"
The security personnel thought for a moment and added another assurance before looking seriously at Li Assistant.
