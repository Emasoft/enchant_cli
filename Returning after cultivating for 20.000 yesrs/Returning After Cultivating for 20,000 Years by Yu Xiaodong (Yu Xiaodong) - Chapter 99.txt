Chapter 486: Rescue

Su Nantian could not help but admire him greatly upon hearing this. This person's mind was truly sharp, realizing that locking Wang Meng away would still require some time to open the toilet door even if he had gained freedom. Thus, Su Nantian would have to face two people himself—especially since one of them was holding a gun against Nangong Ping's head.

Thus, Wang Meng was also locked inside the toilet, and he had considered Nangong Ping's safety, so he dared not rashly break through the door to escape.

"Let us go," this man said, guiding Nangong Ping toward the door while carefully watching Su Nantian. For them, almost all variables had been eliminated; only Su Nantian remained as an unpredictable factor. If the two of them could safely reach the door, they would be ready to escape.

"Stand there and don't move," he said while moving, "I'll release Nangong Ping after I take him out. Don't act rashly—my gun doesn't discriminate!"

Su Nantian responded while watching Nangong Ping, nodding to him to remain calm.

Yet Su Nantian was surprised by Nangong Ping's unexpected composure. He had expected that this so-called "golden-haired grass" would be trembling in fear, weeping and wailing at such a moment. But Nangong Ping remained calm as if he were the one in control.

But soon, Su Nantian understood. It must be due to their Nangong family's circumstances—these young masters and mistresses were often targeted, so they had encountered such situations before. Even if the Nangong family's security system was excellent, it could not prevent people from seeking money. Thus, they had inevitably been approached before. Therefore, Nangong Ping and his sister Nangong Yuyan had become accustomed to such scenarios. They knew the best course of action was to remain quiet and avoid provoking those who had kidnapped or held them.

The two men retreated toward the door while keeping an eye on Su Nantian standing by it. When they reached the entrance, this man pressed the gun against Nangong Ping's head and stepped out. He then said to Su Nantian, "Wait a moment before coming over!"

After saying this, the man struck Nangong Ping's back of the head with the gunstock. Immediately, Nangong Ping collapsed unconscious. The two men then rushed out.

Su Nantian immediately chased after them, but when he reached the door, he noticed that Nangong Ping's back of the head was bleeding. The man had struck with such force that he not only knocked Nangong Ping out but also fractured his skull.

At this moment, Su Nantian realized the men had already vanished.

Meanwhile, Wang Meng saw Su Nantian's figure pass by the toilet door and immediately used brute force to break open the door. When he stepped out, he saw Su Nantian holding the unconscious Nangong Ping.

"What happened? Why is there blood on him? Is the master alright?" Wang Meng asked in shock.

"First, call for help and notify the Wu family to immediately seal off the entire Wu estate. Do not let these people escape!"

Su Nantian knew these people would never get far; they could not evade the Wu family's multiple checkpoints. He had already observed their arrival when they came by car. From the moment they entered the Wu estate's premises, there were seven or eight sentries—both visible and hidden. Unless these people had secret escape routes or were actually Wu family members, they would never manage to flee. Thus, sealing the area would definitely capture them.

Chapter 487: Rescue

Su Nantian said this to Wang Meng, but Wang Meng did not follow Su Nantian's instructions and remained standing there.

Su Nantian turned back with a curious expression, saying, "I told you to call for help. Why are you still standing here?"

Wang Meng looked troubled and said, "The master had already agreed to let them leave without pursuing or reporting."

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian almost wanted to slap him.

"That was a temporary measure to protect the master's life. Now that they've escaped, what do you care? Do as I told you immediately!" Su Nantian had never encountered such an inflexible subordinate. Although Wang Meng was good, he was merely blind loyal—doing whatever Nangong Ping said without thinking for himself.

Seeing Su Nantian angry, Wang Meng finally nodded and left to call for help as instructed. He also notified the Wu family.

Nangong Yuyan had already received news and rushed out. In fact, she had heard some commotion in her room but thought it was just someone cleaning outside.

But when she saw Su Nantian holding the unconscious Nangong Ping on the ground, she screamed in alarm and ran over. "What happened? What's wrong with my brother? Call a doctor immediately!"

Nangong Yuyan was clearly shocked by the scene. The master had been about to leave the Wu estate today, but instead, he was found like this. Especially now, Nangong Ping's wound on his head was still bleeding, and Su Nantian's hand was pressing against the injury, already stained with blood.

After Nangong Yuyan had called for help, she turned to Su Nantian and said, "Why are you still standing here? Hurry up and put Nangong Ping on the bed. The doctor is coming!"

Su Nantian shook his head and said, "No, he has a head injury. We must not move him lightly. My current hand pressing against his head is the safest way for him. If you move him rashly, he might suffer another impact."

Hearing this, Nangong Yuyan realized she should listen to Su Nantian. Her knowledge in this area was shallow, and she had heard similar advice before—never move a head-injured person.

"Where is Wang Meng? And what exactly happened? How could your bodyguards protect like this?" Nangong Yuyan looked around and asked once she saw only Su Nantian.

"Wang Meng went to notify the Wu family, and as for this incident, we did fail in our protection. I accept my punishment." Su Nantian did not explain further; he knew that the more he explained, the more Nangong Yuyan would resent him.

What Su Nantian sought was not his own innocence or justice, but to remain in the Nangong family for a long time—thus gaining more opportunities to interact with the Wu family.

But when Nangong Yuyan heard Su Nantian's words, she unexpectedly did not continue. This made Su Nantian feel strange, but since she was not blaming him, who would waste time seeking trouble? So Su Nantian continued pressing Nangong Ping's wound, waiting for the doctor to arrive.

Finally, Wang Meng led a group of people running over. Some among them were clearly doctors wearing uniforms and carrying medical kits, while others carried a stretcher.

"These are the Wu family's private doctors. As for other details, I've already informed the Wu family; they have sealed all entrances and exits and are now searching for those who harmed the master." Wang Meng said while panting, clearly having expended a lot of energy.

"Can you tell me the current condition of the injured?" The doctor was very professional, kneeling on the ground without rashly moving Nangong Ping. Instead, he first asked Su Nantian, who was pressing the wound.

Su Nantian nodded and said, "His back of the head was struck heavily with a gunstock. They probably wanted to knock him out, but the force was too strong—he's bleeding from that area. I've been pressing the wound with my hand, but the blood hasn't stopped yet. We have kept this position without changing it."

The doctor nodded in approval and said, "Good. Your actions are professional. His head injury is serious; it's hard to say what effects it might have, as the brain has many nerves. You can now hand him over to me."

The doctor said this while pressing Nangong Ping's wound with his hand. Su Nantian immediately withdrew his hand, and the people following him quickly brought over the stretcher. They carefully placed Nangong Ping on it.

"I will now take Master Nangong to our infirmary," the doctor said and left with several people carrying Nangong Ping.

Su Nantian, Nangong Yuyan, and Wang Meng followed closely.

The Wu family had a fully equipped medical room. Though it lacked large machines found in hospitals, treating Nangong Ping's wound was effortless.

After the doctor examined Nangong Ping and stopped the bleeding on his head, he immediately took him to the CT room for an X-ray to confirm there were no internal injuries.

During this time, Wu Chuan also arrived. He asked in alarm, "What happened? How could such a thing happen at this time?"

Nangong Yuyan coldly replied, "I don't know how the Wu family manages security. These people managed to jump into his room through the ventilation shaft. Does that mean all Wu family vents are open for anyone to enter? That would make it easy for anyone to harm whom they wish!"

Nangong Yuyan gave Wu Chuan no face at all, and Wu Chuan immediately apologized.

After all, this incident was clearly the Wu family's negligence, and it was a critical moment. Wu Chuan could not afford to anger the Nangong family, as he still relied on their votes.

Chapter 488: Rescue

Wu Chuan listened to Nangong Yuyan's words and could only laugh awkwardly, saying, "Miss Nangong, rest assured. The Wu family will thoroughly investigate this matter. We have already sealed the surrounding area; these people cannot escape. Also, we've checked the surveillance footage and found no flies could pass our sentries."

Wu Chuan said this while patting his chest, looking resolute.

"Hopefully so. If anything happens to my brother, the Wu family will not be able to bear the consequences. Moreover, today is also the final voting day for the Wu family's heir election. Whether we can get our Nangong family's vote depends on how you handle this matter."

Although Nangong Yuyan was one generation younger than Wu Chuan, Wu Chuan was merely an adopted son of the Wu family. Thus, in terms of status, he was certainly inferior to Nangong Yuyan's family. Moreover, the Nangong family's power was greater than the Wu family's. Facing them, Wu Chuan could only swallow his anger and endure silently.

Furthermore, Nangong Yuyan's words were correct—today was also the Wu family's heir election day. Wu Chuan needed to gain their Nangong family's vote by handling this matter well, making them satisfied.

Upon hearing this, Wu Chuan raised an eyebrow and knew the situation was severe. After all, Nangong family's vote did not just represent one family; the Huang family would also follow their lead. Thus, it was two votes. If he failed to resolve this matter today, he would lose both votes.

Additionally, Wu Chuan had been overly confident before, contacting only the Nangong family when reaching out to these major families. Moreover, if he repeated his conditions for others, the Wu family's profits would be very low.

Thus, he had chosen to only win over the Nangong family. Therefore, at this moment, if he could not obtain the Nangong family's vote, Wu Chuan might face a situation where he received no votes from these major families.

Upon thinking of this, Wu Chuan knew the situation was extremely critical. He immediately told those around him, "Assign more people to search and investigate. Inform the other major families as well, asking them to cooperate with our investigation for their safety. Search every room thoroughly."

After the Wu family's subordinates agreed, just as they were about to leave, Wu Chuan called them back and said, "Wait. Also, assign more people to search the entire estate's premises, including places they might go outside. Mobilize all Wu family sentries and patrols. I must find these people, even if it means turning the area upside down."

When Wu Chuan said this, he was determined. He knew if he did not do so, he would not be able to give the Nangong family a satisfactory explanation. Moreover, time was limited before the evening banquet.

Thus, he now had to mobilize all Wu family personnel; only then could he ensure they found the people.

Nangong Yuyan listened to Wu Chuan's words and snorted, "That's better. I hope you find the culprits before the banquet starts. If not, our Nangong family will act according to our own judgment. After all, if they are not found, I can only prove your lack of ability and that you are unsuitable to control the Wu family."

Upon hearing Nangong Yuyan's words, Wu Chuan clenched his fists. He had already disliked Nangong Yuyan since the beginning, but her background made him unable to provoke her.

Thus, Wu Chuan could only suppress his inner anger and smiled politely, saying, "Miss Nangong, rest assured. I will find the culprits. Also, I would like to borrow your Nangong family's bodyguard for a moment. I want to ask him about the details of this incident and the features of those people, so we can search more efficiently."

Upon hearing Wu Chuan's words, Nangong Yuyan nodded and said to Su Nantian and Wang Meng standing beside her, "You two cooperate with the Wu family's investigation. Tell everything you saw and knew. Do not miss any key information. This matter concerns Master Nangong's safety."

When Nangong Yuyan said the last sentence, she also looked at Wu Chuan thoughtfully. Her words did not only refer to those who harmed Nangong Ping but also warned Wu Chuan.

If the Wu family failed to give a good response this time, and if they did not handle this matter well, it was not just about the votes for tonight's heir election. The Nangong family would take some actions against the Wu family, as this incident occurred on Wu family territory.

Wu Chuan, shrewd and experienced, could not miss the hidden meaning in Nangong Yuyan's words. His brows furrowed tightly, realizing he had hit a wall. He never expected some people to create such a situation.

Upon thinking of this, Wu Chuan immediately suspected those competitors. After all, this incident was quite suspicious. Since the Wu family's security was strong, it would be very difficult for these people to escape. Yet they still did this thing.

Upon thinking of this, Wu Chuan felt even more troubled. He had only a few hours left to find these people and must mobilize all forces. If he could not resolve this matter before the banquet, the Nangong family's vote would end up in someone else's hands.

Thus, Wu Chuan told his assistant again, "From now on, every person in the Wu family must search everywhere. Do not miss any place. I want them to turn over every inch of the Wu family and find these people!"

Chapter 489: The Stone That Bounced Back

After Wu Chuan issued his orders to his subordinates, he said to Su Nantian and Wang Meng, "Please explain the situation today in detail. Include those people—did you see what they looked like?"

"I didn't see them wearing masks. I can't describe their appearance clearly," Wang Meng said before Su Nantian could speak.

Upon hearing this, Wu Chuan told his assistant something and after a while, the assistant nodded and approached Wang Meng. "Please come with me. We have a professional portrait artist here who has various human facial features. When you see one that resembles them, point it out to him."

Upon hearing this, Wang Meng did not immediately agree but turned back to look at Nangong Yuyan. At this moment, since Nangong Ping was unconscious, he had to follow Nangong Yuyan's orders.

Nangong Yuyan nodded and said to Wang Meng, "Go with him. The Wu family is professional in this area. The sooner you identify them, the sooner we can catch them."

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian felt a little doubtful in his heart. What other hidden professions did the Wu family have? They could even do such professional things—wasn't this a police skill?

After obtaining Nangong Yuyan's approval, Wang Meng followed Wu Chuan's assistant away. Wu Chuan remained and said to Su Nantian, "Please explain what happened today."

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian nodded and said, "We were in the study with Master Nangong when we heard strange noises outside. I went out to check and found four people entering the room through the ventilation shaft on the ceiling. They were searching for something in the living room but didn't find it."

Su Nantian said this while pretending to recall.

He roughly described the process and then suddenly remembered something, saying excitedly, "Oh right, they had guns. Because they held Master Nangong hostage, I dared not rush forward. If I had, the consequences could have been unimaginable."

After Wu Chuan heard this, he immediately furrowed his brows. He had not expected these people to carry guns—this was a different approach than if they didn't.

If these people had no guns, the search would not need such high vigilance. But if they carried guns, there was a risk to life, so they must increase their precautions.

Wu Chuan immediately took out his phone and called someone, saying, "The people who escaped have guns. Everyone must raise their alertness. Use extreme measures if necessary."

"Uncle Wu, does the Wu family have cameras? Why haven't we reviewed any surveillance yet?" Nangong Yuyan suddenly thought of something and asked.

Wu Chuan awkwardly replied, "I'm sorry. The Wu family only has cameras at the entrances. Originally, there were a few in the corridors, but before your families arrived, they specifically requested not to have any surveillance equipment. You were supposed to ensure your own safety with bodyguards, so we removed all the cameras here. Look, there are still traces."

Upon Wu Chuan saying this, the others looked in the direction he pointed. Indeed, there were traces of being removed on the ceiling, with some wires exposed—probably all the cameras in this area had been taken down.

This request was also made by the major families before they moved into the Wu family, so it wasn't anyone's fault. Nangong Yuyan probably also remembered the decision at that time.

Indeed, it was understandable for these families to make such a request since they came into the Wu family's premises, which was risky. If they were monitored by the Wu family, it might leak some of their secrets.

Thus, the Nangong family led the request for the Wu family to remove all cameras except at the entrances, leaving none in their living areas.

Upon seeing Nangong Yuyan's expression, Su Nantian immediately understood what was happening. He couldn't help but smile inwardly—this was truly his own stone that had bounced back. He guessed Nangong Yuyan hadn't expected that the request to remove cameras would become a major obstacle in catching the culprits.

"Then, can we check the entrance surveillance cameras?" Nangong Yuyan steadied her emotions and said.

"We've already sent people to review them. There are eight entrances in this mansion, and all the surveillance cameras are under investigation. It will take some time."

After Wu Chuan said this, someone from the Wu family ran over and told him, "Master, we've already checked all entrance surveillance cameras. No suspicious people left."

Upon hearing this, Wu Chuan raised an eyebrow and said doubtfully, "Have you carefully checked? Did you miss any details?"

The person nodded confidently and said, "We had more than ten people watch the surveillance together. None of us saw any suspicious people. According to the information you provided, we've locked down the time frame and even included the previous half-hour. Except for some Wu family security personnel moving around, no one left this mansion during that time."

"But have you checked the Wu family security personnel? Could someone have infiltrated as a spy and then harmed Master Nangong?" Wu Chuan continued asking.

"They've all been checked, and the Nangong family's bodyguard confirmed they were not among the four culprits," this person replied.

"This is strange. No one left through the entrances, so these culprits must still be inside this mansion. Or maybe there are hidden exits?"

Wu Chuan was truly puzzled. Where could these people have gone? They were searching thoroughly but still hadn't found them.

Chapter 490: Wu Chuan's Outburst

The search had now reached an impasse. From the surveillance footage, no one had left this mansion. Thus, the culprits must still be hiding within these rooms. However, the Wu family had not given up searching outside the mansion; all sentries—both visible and hidden—had been mobilized, conducting a thorough search of the entire Wu family premises.

"I see. Continue to check if there are any hidden exits inside the mansion, like this time they used the ventilation shaft. Look for other places that could allow entry and exit. Search for any areas that are rarely used but can still accommodate people leaving."

Su Nantian had to admit Wu Chuan's mind was clear. In this situation, he hadn't let too many distractions cloud his judgment.

The person had not yet left when Wu Chuan continued, "Send a team to me. I'll lead them myself. After all, there are other families' rooms. It's difficult for you to do this. I'll go myself."

"Understood, Master. I'll organize the people immediately," this person said and left to gather security as instructed.

Within five minutes, a well-organized group had assembled—nearly twenty people. Each looked equipped and strong, clearly trained bodyguards.

"Master," the leader respectfully stood before Wu Chuan and said.

"Good, you all follow me out. When we go to other families' rooms for a search, be careful and don't act rashly without my orders."

After saying this, Wu Chuan was about to leave with the group.

"Miss, let me go with them. At least I still remember what those people looked like and can identify them immediately," Su Nantian said to Nangong Yuyan as Wu Chuan was about to leave.

Nangong Yuyan nodded and called out to Wu Chuan, "Uncle Wu, let our family's bodyguard go with you. He has seen those people before and will help your search. It also shows our Nangong family's involvement, which is better for the other families to accept."

Upon hearing this, Wu Chuan thought it was reasonable. Taking so many Wu family bodyguards to search would inevitably cause friction with other families.

Although they were now on Wu family territory, they were staying here, and the Wu family had promised them maximum privacy. However, now bringing a group to search their rooms would certainly offend them.

But if they brought the Nangong family's people instead, it was for the Nangong family's business. Other families would at least think twice before retaliating, as the Nangong family's influence was still there. Even families like the Wang family, who were on par with the Nangong family, would publicly support them after such an incident.

Thus, Wu Chuan smiled and said, "Then it's great. I was also thinking about whether the Nangong family's bodyguard should stay to protect you. Actually, I had planned to take him with me."

Su Nantian nodded to Nangong Yuyan and immediately followed, walking at the end of Wu Chuan's group as they headed toward other families' rooms.

It must be said that the Wu family's mansion was indeed large. This main building had seven floors and underground levels.

This time, the Wu family hosted other families, and to protect their privacy, each floor housed only one family. Thus, the Nangong family occupied the top floor, with other families on different levels below.

"Next floor is the Song family. They are probably easygoing, but everyone should be careful and not act disrespectfully. When searching, don't rummage around—just check if anyone is hiding," Wu Chuan led the group downward, giving instructions as they walked.

Su Nantian listened and smiled inwardly. It seemed the Song family was indeed a "jack-of-all-trades" type, with good relations with every family. Thus, they had a reputation as easygoing and kind, but from his contact with Song Yuchen, he knew the Song family's true nature was far from that.

Wu Chuan knocked on Song Yuanyang's door, and it was immediately opened. Inside, Song Yuanyang's voice could be heard.

"Is it Wu Chuan? I've been waiting for you a long time." It seemed the Song family had already known about this incident and had sent people to wait here, cooperating with Wu Chuan's actions.

Wu Chuan smiled and entered, saying, "Indeed, the Song family is the most understanding. I'll have my people search a little. If nothing's found, we'll leave immediately and not disturb you."

Song Yuanyang nodded and signaled his people to step back, allowing Wu Chuan's group to search.

Thus, Su Nantian followed Wu Chuan's group into Song Yuanyang's room and began searching. The Wu family provided good accommodation, and the room was of considerable size, so it took some time for this group to search thoroughly.

However, they found nothing—every corner had been checked, including the ventilation shafts—but there was still no sign of anything unusual.

It made sense that the Song family would not be involved in this incident, as they had no vital interests to gain.

As the people below reported their findings to Wu Chuan, he nodded and smiled at Song Yuanyang again. "I'm sorry for the trouble. My subordinates have already informed me that they found nothing. We'll leave now and visit the other families. Please be careful with your safety, and of course, our Wu family will strengthen security to prevent this from happening again."

After saying this, Wu Chuan and Song Yuanyang said their goodbyes and left the Song family's floor.

At the same time, other people were searching in different areas of this floor but found nothing—evidently, these culprits had not hidden here.

Even if they wanted to hide here, the Song family would not allow it; why would they invite trouble upon themselves?

Chapter 491: Wu Chuan's Outburst

After Su Nantian and Wu Chuan's group left the Song family's floor, Wu Chuan's face suddenly grew more solemn. He then told those behind him, "Be careful now. Next is the Wang family's floor. Do not act rashly without my orders."

At this point, Wu Chuan even looked back at Su Nantian standing at the end of the group and said, "And you, young man—don't reveal your identity recklessly. You know the relationship between the Wang family and your Nangong family. Just follow behind and don't interfere. Understood?"

Su Nantian looked at Wu Chuan's demeanor, which seemed to be on high alert. He wanted to laugh but restrained his true feelings and nodded seriously, "You can rest assured; I know what to do."

Upon hearing Su Nantian's reply, Wu Chuan nodded and led a group of people downward.

As they reached the Wang family's floor, outside were densely packed with Wang family bodyguards. This surprised Wu Chuan; he had expected them to reduce their numbers, but the Wang family had suddenly brought so many bodyguards, which was astonishing.

"What's going on?" Wu Chuan felt very puzzled when his assistant ran over to him.

"Master, what's going on with the Wang family? Why are there so many people here?"

"Master, after learning about the Nangong family's incident, the Wang family immediately refused our advice and secretly mobilized a group of people. We couldn't afford to offend them, so we had to let them in."

Wu Chuan's assistant frowned and said helplessly.

"How fast did they come? How could the Wang family mobilize so many people in such a short time?" Wu Chuan asked, confused. Even if these were the Wang family's people, it was too fast for them to arrive in under an hour. How could they have traveled such a long distance so quickly?

At first, Su Nantian didn't understand what this meant. But after joining the Nangong family and studying some knowledge about these major families, he realized that each family occupied a different area in the capital. Thus, the distances between them were quite far.

Therefore, Wu Chuan's surprise at the Wang family's ability to mobilize so quickly was understandable.

"Master, look outside," his assistant said and pointed out the window. Wu Chuan walked over to the window and saw several helicopters parked on the lawn outside their mansion.

Ah, it was the Wang family's people who had rushed over by private jet. No wonder they could arrive in an hour despite the long distance.

"The Wang family's people are really arrogant—they didn't even inform us before bringing their people and flying in by helicopter. They mainly wanted to harm our Wu family, and we were caught off guard." Wu Chuan looked at this scene and was very unhappy.

After all, it was the Wu family's territory. Even if the Wang family wanted to mobilize their people, they should have informed Wu Chuan beforehand. But now the Wang family had secretly mobilized their people and even flown in without permission, which was too arrogant.

But Wu Chuan thought for a moment and realized he couldn't afford to offend another family now.

Mainly, the Nangong family's incident hadn't been resolved yet. If he offended the Wang family over this, the Wu family would be caught between two enemies. Why would he foolishly offend the two strongest families among the major ones? Thus, this anger had to be swallowed.

So Wu Chuan waved his hand and said to his assistant, "Never mind; as long as it doesn't cause a big commotion or disturbance, just pretend not to see it."

After saying this, Wu Chuan led the group toward the Wang family's door. But they hadn't taken two steps before being blocked by the Wang family's private bodyguards standing in the hallway.

"Now, we can't let you pass without our master's command. Do you have any authorization?" Unexpectedly, the Wang family's bodyguards had blocked Wu Chuan. Yes, right on Wu Chuan's own territory.

Wu Chuan smiled helplessly; he was almost ready to spit blood, but Su Nantian saw Wu Chuan's face turn a deep red. However, he still restrained his fists and waited half a moment before saying, "I am the current power holder of the Wu family. We need to investigate the Wang family's floors for this unexpected incident today. I want to meet the Wang family's master. Blocking me like this isn't very appropriate."

But unexpectedly, the Wang family's bodyguard waved his hand and said, "I only obey my master's orders. If you don't have anything to prove that our master agrees for you to enter, I will absolutely not let you in. No matter who you are or your status and identity."
