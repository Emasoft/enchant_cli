The male accountant felt his dignity had been thoroughly humiliated today. Not only had he misjudged a divine wealth figure, but now he was forced to kneel before him in front of so many acquaintances.

If Su Nantian were merely an ordinary person, it would have been acceptable. Even if he lost, he could have denied it. But the man was capable of casually producing hundreds of millions; if he didn't kneel today, he feared being crushed in the future.

Well, well. After all, Su Nantian's status was clear. Han Xin once endured the humiliation of crawling under a man's crotch; what was kneeling before a wealthy patron compared to that?

At this thought, the male accountant was about to surrender his pride when Su Nantian waved a hand to stop him.

"Does money really hold such power that it can make a seven-foot man lower himself?"

Su Nantian, thinking the man lacked backbone, sneered: "I don't like to trouble others, but that doesn't mean this matter is over. You've already said you'd resign; let's change the stakes to your unconditional departure from New Yue. Don't even dream of taking this year's salary. New Yue hires elites, not parasites who betray their masters."

Su Nantian spoke with righteous fervor—his words borrowed from Yue Xiaoshan's recent speech at the company.

Hearing this, the male accountant's face changed. He had hoped that even if he left New Yue today, he could enjoy the year's salary for a while. But he hadn't expected Su Nantian to be so ruthless, cutting off his only escape route.

Thinking that even if he left New Yue Group, he wouldn't get his due share of money, the male accountant's face shifted repeatedly. Finally, he chose silence—Su Nantian's power had deeply intimidated him; he dared to be angry but couldn't speak out.

Chapter 332: Counterattack

"You all needn't gloat. I said it—New Yue won't keep fence-sitters. Please leave through this door gracefully, thank you."

Su Nantian turned around and coldly addressed the few employees who had gossiped earlier.

Upon hearing he too would face the same fate, these rebellious troublemakers instantly adopted gloomy faces. They wanted to beg but had no courage left, unlike when they'd resigned.

But Su Nantian wouldn't fall for their act. He nodded to Wu Han and turned away, confident she'd handle them.

Before Su Nantian had taken a few steps, Wu Han hurried after him.

"Did you finish so quickly?" Su Nantian marveled at Wu Han's efficiency.

"A bunch of riffraff. No need to care about them."

Wu Han walked beside Su Nantian, glancing at him many times. She found that this man's face—once somewhat unappealing—gradually had an attractive charm. Moreover, the man was kind-hearted and didn't care about money—this was exactly what she'd longed for in an ideal man. She wouldn't fall for him because he was rich.

She merely admired Su Nantian's integrity and his disregard for wealth.

Su Nantian felt embarrassed by her stares. He tilted his head and asked, "I say, Wu Manager, is there a flower on my face? If you want to look, just do it openly."

Wu Han's cheeks flushed. She quickly denied, "Hmph, I didn't know you'd be so rich. A divine wealth figure serving as Xiaoshan's bodyguard—don't get me started on your kind of rich people."

But when she mentioned Yue Xiaoshan, Su Nantian frowned. He hadn't seen her since earlier—had the girl done something foolish?

But thinking of Yue Xiaoshan's personality, he shook his head in self-mockery.

"By the way, Wu Manager, don't let Yue Xiaoshan know about my investment in the company."

He seemed to recall something and suddenly looked at Wu Han, his expression serious. "Please keep it a secret."

"Ah?"

Wu Han had been thinking of discussing this with Yue Xiaoshan, but Su Nantian's sudden words surprised her.

"Are you joking? You've contributed so much to New Yue, yet you don't want anyone to know. Isn't that like throwing money away?"

Wu Han was indignant at Su Nantian's decision. After all, it was five hundred million—donating five or fifty million would be nothing, but a full five hundred million could shake the economy of a medium-sized city. Could he really just throw it away?

"I understand. I'm friends with Yue Xiaoshan, and helping her is my duty. But with her high-minded nature, if she knew it was me who funded her, it might hurt her pride."

Su Nantian answered earnestly. He truly wanted to help Yue Xiaoshan, never expecting her to do anything or change her opinion.

On the contrary, he feared that if Yue Xiaoshan knew about this, their newly cultivated feelings would become strained.

"Truly admirable. But why would Xiaoshan be hurt by such a thing?"

Wu Han, despite not understanding Su Nantian's thoughts, was deeply moved by his careful consideration.

"Fine. Since you said so, I'll be magnanimous and keep it secret! No more talking—I need to get back to work. This time, we must make those attackers regret coming here!"

Wu Han patted Su Nantian's shoulder. The gloom on her face vanished instantly. She strode towards the meeting room.

Dingdong!

At that moment, Yue Xiaoshan was daydreaming on the top floor of New Yue. She suddenly snapped out of it, gazing at her temporary office. Her heart was filled with Su Nantian's departing back.

Had he really left?

Why, when she was about to lose the company, her thoughts were only of that man? After all, a bankrupt Yue Xiaoshan—how could he still want to stay with her?

Yue Xiaoshan gazed at the sofa Su Nantian had loved to lie on. Even the sound of her phone's alert went unnoticed.

"Your account ending with 1122 has received five..."

Hearing the emotionless electronic voice reciting this message, Yue Xiaoshan's face shifted slightly. She was self-deprecating.

This card was under her name, but its purpose was for large transfers over millions to the finance department. It allowed her to check at any time without having to constantly go to finance.

Even now, with such a situation, there was still money coming in. But five million could do nothing—five hundred million would be a drop in the bucket.

She was about to think this when the electronic voice finished: "hundred million. Please note the receipt!"

Boom!

Yue Xiaoshan suddenly stood up from her chair, the force pushing the leather seat three meters away. Her eyes trembled as she shook her hands to open her phone's lock screen. The first message was clearly visible.

"1, 2..."

Yue Xiaoshan counted the large five, followed by eight zeros. She couldn't control her emotions; tears immediately flowed from her eyes.

This five hundred million had been transferred without hesitation, all at once. Six hundred million!

Although she didn't know where the money came from, she knew New Yue had been saved.

" Wu Han, it's me, Yue Xiaoshan. Convey my order—use all our funds to distribute to the subsidiaries. Under the condition of ensuring New Yue's shares remain safe, inform everyone to counterattack!"

Yue Xiaoshan immediately called Wu Han and issued a death command. At that moment, Wu Han was already directing in the meeting room.

In a high-end club in Jiangcheng's suburbs, Yue Lin and Daquan Goushila stared in disbelief at the New Yue stock on the big screen. The red line that had plummeted to its lowest point suddenly shot up ninety degrees in an instant, nearly breaking the screen's display range.

"Five hundred million more?"

Yue Lin swallowed hard. He extended a hand, counting the percentage points of New Yue's total stock market value, then looked at Daquan Goushila, who also wore a grim face.

"Damn! This is impossible!"

Daquan Goushila let out an ugly roar, smashing his wine glass to the ground. "You said Xiaoshan was at her wit's end, and the Yue family wouldn't support her. Why is someone investing five hundred million in New Yue?"

Yue Lin was bewildered. As far as he knew, the only person capable around Xiaoshan was this Su Nantian.

Chapter 333: A Resounding Victory

And Su Nantian was clearly a warrior. How could he have so much money? Perhaps Xiaoshan had attached herself to a rich divine wealth figure?

Yue Lin didn't think it was the Yue family's secret support for Xiaoshan. After all, this incident had happened suddenly; even if the Yue family wanted to send money, they might not have been able to.

He never imagined that the person he'd considered least significant—Su Nantian—was actually this divine wealth figure.

"Mr. Daquan, New Yue's people have started their counterattack!"

A staff member controlling the computer suddenly looked up, his voice tense. "Everyone quickly look at the screen."

Sure enough, New Yue's total stock rapidly split, pouring five hundred million into its attacked subsidiaries, forming a circulation of funds.

Daquan gritted his teeth. "Fools! What are you waiting for? Don't let them have a chance to recover—crush them!"

"Yes!"

The staff members nodded, eyes fixed on the stock market chart. That day, all Jiangcheng's investors were in an uproar.

At afternoon, as the largest company in Jiangcheng, New Yue and all its subsidiaries were suddenly attacked by an unknown force. The stock market plummeted to rock bottom.

Yet, as some smart investors quickly sold their New Yue shares, the company—once on the brink of death—suddenly rose again. The investment amount in the stock market surged to five hundred million.

Some wise investors immediately noticed the trend and rushed their money into New Yue stocks, hoping to make a big profit.

At five o'clock in the afternoon, as New Yue's final closing bell rang, the unknown force suddenly collapsed. All stocks were quickly snapped up by opportunistic investors and New Yue itself within seconds.

This battle directly influenced Jiangcheng's overall economic trend. Naturally, some were happy while others mourned. Some became rich overnight; others lost everything and chose to jump.

"Angry!"

Among the mourners were certainly Daquan Goushila and other Japanese people. They had lost almost everything this time.

They'd thought it was a sure win, so they'd invested most of their liquid funds. They'd assumed New Yue was an easy target—yet it turned out to be a wolf in sheep's clothing.

"Hey, Liu Zi, are you there? Tell him to send people to thoroughly investigate who dared interfere with our affairs. No matter who he is, bring his head to me!"

As Daquan Goushila roared into the phone, this unprecedented farce finally ended.

In the end, New Yue concluded with a thunderous finish. They seized massive floating shares from investors and made an additional three hundred million profit on top of recovering all their losses.

"We won! We won!"

"Haha, New Yue hold on!"

"I knew we could turn danger into safety."

"Out! Get out of here, you fake employee!"

In every office at New Yue, cheers erupted. They were excited because each of them had participated in this war without smoke and with a value of hundreds of millions.

Fortuitously, New Yue hadn't given up hope during the critical moment. They hadn't colluded with those fence-sitters.

In New Yue's largest conference room, watching the stock rise continuously and finally fix at an unprecedented height, Yue Xiaoshan finally sighed in relief and slumped into her boss's chair.

A fleeting smile crossed her lips. She didn't even bother to tidy her slightly disheveled professional attire before issuing another order: "Everyone, take the initiative. Based on this network address, investigate their origins."

Yue Xiaoshan's icy demeanor remained unchanged. As a female business tycoon, she wasn't one to be pushed around. Though deep down she could guess this had something to do with Yue Lin and others, one thing puzzled her: given Yue Lin's status in the family, could he really have arranged so much money to shake New Yue?

If it weren't for the unknown force's help, New Yue would have already become a hollow shell. Thinking of this, Yue Xiaoshan's face flashed with anger: no matter who the opponent was, she would make them pay!

Thus, Daquan Goushila dispatched professional intelligence agents to investigate New Yue's background. Unbeknownst to them, Yue Xiaoshan was also tracing their steps.

"Xiaoshan, General Manager Xiaoshan, are you okay?"

At that moment, Wu Han had already known the battle was over. She rushed into the conference room as soon as New Yue closed, seeing the faint smile on Yue Xiaoshan's face and finally sighed in relief.

"Everyone, leave. Oh, by the way, remember to inform the company staff later. To celebrate today's victory, everyone stay and I'll hold a victory banquet!"

Yue Xiaoshan addressed the company's top executives in the conference room. She knew the importance of reward and punishment strategies for a big company. Now that New Yue had climbed another level after the battle, it was essential to give employees enough benefits and rest time.

"You scared me. Did you know I thought you'd given up?"

After everyone left, Wu Han hurried to Yue Xiaoshan's side. Seeing the sweat in her hair, she knew how agonizing it had been for her.

She understood the importance of New Yue to Yue Xiaoshan. Otherwise, she wouldn't have rushed to celebrate with everyone immediately after the victory.

"I'm fine, Xiaohan. Thank you!"

In front of Wu Han, Yue Xiaoshan naturally let go of her boss's burden. She looked at her gratefully.

From the bloodshot eyes in Wu Han's, she knew Wu Han had put in a lot of effort. Having such a good friend was truly the happiness of being a woman.

"You don't need to be polite with me."

Wu Han casually hugged Yue Xiaoshan. Her heart ached—Yue Xiaoshan had given so much to the company!

"Nothing, but at least better than some people."

Now that the crisis was over, Yue Xiaoshan suddenly remembered the man she had driven away earlier. Thinking of his determined departure, a frosty expression returned to her face.

It was said that victory could temporarily cloud one's mind. Undoubtedly, after escaping danger, Yue Xiaoshan subconsciously thought Su Nantian had left because she was broke. Even in the most desperate times, he hadn't stayed to accompany her.

But how could she forget that it was her own pride that had driven Su Nantian away?

Chapter 334: Torn Between Feelings

"Uh, Xiaoshan, what are you talking about?"

Wu Han heard Yue Xiaoshan's seemingly pointed words and furrowed her brows. She seemed to realize something.

"Nothing, I just remembered a heartless person."

Yue Xiaoshan released Wu Han's hug. For some reason, Su Nantian's departing back had been lingering in her heart.

"Did you mean Su Nantian?"

Wu Han asked tentatively. Actually, her inner conflict was clear—just like Su Nantian had some misunderstandings about Yue Xiaoshan, now it seemed Yue Xiaoshan had also developed a rift with him.

She hesitated whether to tell Yue Xiaoshan the truth.

"Hmph, I never thought he'd leave like that."

Yue Xiaoshan said coldly. Then she suddenly realized an important issue.

"By the way, Xiaohan, do you know who secretly helped New Yue? Just now someone suddenly transferred five hundred million to my account without leaving a name. I must thank him in person."

Although she didn't know the other's intention, her sixth sense told her he had no malicious intent. At least, he should contact her after the incident.

She wasn't someone who craved money. If she could find him, she would return the original amount intact.

Seeing Yue Xiaoshan's troubled expression, Wu Han's lips twitched involuntarily. Your benefactor is the one you just drove away!

Wu Han outwardly shook her head but inwardly roared. What was this? Su Nantian actually helped her secretly, yet she had misunderstood him.

Yue Xiaoshan said bad things about Su Nantian, but looking at her, it seemed she had already prepared to offer herself to the savior. You two are really a pair of rivals!

She only thought it in her heart, for she respected Su Nantian's decision. That was one of the qualities she admired about him. But this made Yue Xiaoshan increasingly misunderstand Su Nantian, and she felt a little pity for him.

"Xiaoshan, actually Su Nantian wasn't as bad as you thought. He didn't immediately leave..."

Wu Han tried to change Su Nantian's image in Yue Xiaoshan's mind, speaking carefully.

But before she could finish, she was interrupted by Yue Xiaoshan: "Hmph. If he didn't leave immediately, was it to stay and watch me make a fool of myself? I thought he was different from others, but it turned out the same as those fence-sitters! Xiaohan, don't try to persuade me. No matter what, I won't forgive him."

From Wu Han's perspective, Yue Xiaoshan's eyes flickered with darkness. She subconsciously glanced at the end of the corridor, thinking: Su Nantian, you bastard. Why didn't you appear? You left without a word—did you really leave?

Wu Han didn't know the many things that had happened between Yue Xiaoshan and Su Nantian. In her mind, the two were at most a slightly higher level of friendship than subordinates.

Now that Yue Xiaoshan had said this, she at least gave up. She could only silently feel pity for Su Nantian.

While Wu Han and Yue Xiaoshan discussed how to hold the victory banquet for employees, Yue Xiaoshan's awaited figure finally appeared at the end of the corridor.

"Su Nantian!"

Seeing Su Nantian's timely arrival, Wu Han's eyes lit up. Since she had been discussing the plan with Yue Xiaoshan from the beginning, she hadn't been in the mood. Her thoughts were all about Su Nantian's matters. He had invested five hundred million! Yet he said nothing, and she felt like standing up to confess.

Wu Han didn't notice that when Su Nantian appeared, Yue Xiaoshan's eyes flashed with an indescribable light. Hmph, I knew you wouldn't leave like that.

"Hey, what are you two discussing? So happy?"

Su Nantian ignored Yue Xiaoshan's feigned coldness and walked over, placing a hand on Wu Han's shoulder. He asked with a mischievous tone: "What are you two discussing?"

"Oh, General Manager Xiaoshan was discussing the victory banquet tonight. Su Nantian, will you come too?"

Wu Han winked at Su Nantian, implying she had held back and wanted him to tell Yue Xiaoshan the truth.

But Su Nantian, seeing Yue Xiaoshan's dark face, had no intention of revealing it. He thought carefully and said: "There's a party? I definitely have to go. After all, I am also a member of New Yue."

"Ha! You're not worthy to be a New Yue person!"

Yue Xiaoshan's beautiful eyes stared intently at the hand Su Nantian had placed on Wu Han's shoulder. For some reason, her heart suddenly ached.

It was she who had endured everything, yet why didn't he even acknowledge her? Why did he deliberately provoke me? She subconsciously thought Su Nantian was provoking her.

"Boss, did you take medicine?" Su Nantian said with some annoyance.

"General Manager Xiaoshan, Su Nantian was actually driven out by you. Forgive him!" Wu Han had a headache and quickly played the mediator. This was the most humble divine wealth she'd ever seen.

Seeing Su Nantian's carefree expression, Yue Xiaoshan who had just calmed down darkened again. She was about to turn and leave when a light voice came from behind.

"Miss, how did you come?"

Hearing him completely ignoring her temper and even having the time to flirt, Yue Xiaoshan was ready to start a fight. But when she turned around, she was stunned.

"General Manager Xiaoshan."

The female accountant held Su Nantian's black card and a pile of receipts, standing there.

She had intended to take this opportunity to try her luck and see if she could attract Su Nantian, the billionaire. But she hadn't expected so many people here and more terrifyingly, General Manager Xiaoshan was also present.

Seeing the president's dark face, and her beauty that seemed to be from heaven, she instinctively felt shocked. Remembering Su Nantian had given five hundred million for her without even flinching, only she, a versatile beauty, was worthy of this.

"Who are you?"

Yue Xiaoshan saw the female accountant wearing company clothes and glared at Su Nantian. She hadn't expected him to dare flirt with women in her company. This guy was really getting bolder.

"General Manager, I'm here to deliver Su's black card and receipts."

Feeling the queen-like pressure from Yue Xiaoshan, the female accountant felt miserable.

Chapter 335: The Secret Can't Be Kept

If she had known this situation, she would have just let someone else deliver it. Why come here to hang around?

"Delivering things?"

Yue Xiaoshan examined the pile of receipts and a black bank card in the female accountant's hands. It wasn't what she had imagined—flowers or candy. She felt a little relieved.

"Ah, that's right, Xiaoshan, don't argue with Su Nantian anymore. Let's get ready for the victory banquet!"

Wu Han, following Su Nantian's signal, quickly snatched the pile of things from the female accountant. After she left disappointedly, Wu Han handed them to Su Nantian.

"What are you two doing? Secretively?" Yue Xiaoshan noticed Wu Han's strange behavior and sensed something unusual.

"Nothing, nothing." Wu Han said, then pulled Yue Xiaoshan's hand to leave.

"No, you're definitely hiding something from me. Su Nantian, what's in your hand?"

Yue Xiaoshan frowned, showing her dissatisfaction. Su Nantian smiled bitterly at Wu Han. Wu Han gave him a look that said 'you're on your own' and looked away, pretending she knew nothing.

Su Nantian's mood was naturally miserable. He had deliberately kept it a secret from Yue Xiaoshan to respect her pride. But now, the situation was unavoidable.

Yue Xiaoshan's character he knew well—she disliked being deceived.

While Su Nantian was hesitating for the first time, he suddenly felt light in his hand and lost grip. A paper was snatched by Yue Xiaoshan without warning.

"Hmph, I want to know what you're hiding from me." Yue Xiaoshan smiled victoriously and quickly unfolded the white paper...

After seeing its contents, Yue Xiaoshan tightly gripped the light white paper. Her entire body trembled continuously. Her chest rose and fell heavily.

"Su Nantian, what does this receipt mean? I warn you, if you keep hiding it from me, I'll really be angry!"

But Su Nantian saw Yue Xiaoshan's almost pleading expression and felt no anger at all.

He continued to smile bitterly. He hadn't expected this situation when he decided to help Yue Xiaoshan. But he respected her choice.

I wanted to be low-key, but this is what you wanted to know. It's not my intention to show off.

Thinking of this, Su Nantian handed the pile of documents to Yue Xiaoshan. He felt it was meaningless to waste time on this matter.

But his expectant expression betrayed him. After all, how many people do good deeds without wanting the recipient to know? He was afraid that Yue Xiaoshan would not know how to face him after learning the truth.

However, Yue Xiaoshan's expression after seeing those reports was exactly what Su Nantian had expected. Especially when she saw the five hundred million transfer slip with his name signed, her mouth almost closed.

"Su Nantian, you..."

Yue Xiaoshan looked at Wu Han with complex eyes and the carefree Su Nantian. For some reason, her eyes were covered by a thin veil. She looked at this man with gratitude. Though he was usually careless, he always stepped forward when she was hurt.

He had not only saved her life countless times but also now rescued New Yue, which she valued as life.

Yue Xiaoshan felt ashamed for having previously misunderstood Su Nantian and even made him leave. He had done so much for the company, yet she treated him like this—she was too petty.

"Beauty, don't offer yourself to me. I can't bear it."

Su Nantian exaggeratedly waved his hand. He couldn't stand Yue Xiaoshan's expression of gratitude towards him. Thinking it was better to have her ice-cold face as before, he quickly changed the topic to break Yue Xiaoshan's emotional atmosphere.

"Go away! Who wants to offer themselves to you!"

Yue Xiaoshan blushed and teased, still confused about one thing: why did Su Nantian and Wu Han keep it a secret from her? Why hide this matter?

"Xiaoshan, I know what you're thinking. This was all Su Nantian's idea. It has nothing to do with me!" Wu Han understood Yue Xiaoshan's thoughts and quickly distanced herself from Su Nantian.

"What are you talking about? Why didn't you tell me? Why keep it a secret?" Yue Xiaoshan asked confusedly.

"Because Su Nantian actually wanted to..."

Wu Han saw Yue Xiaoshan's confused expression and smiled mysteriously. Then she looked at Su Nantian, who was silent. Hmph, he wanted to be a nameless good person? I won't let him succeed!

As they walked and talked, eventually Yue Xiaoshan understood that Su Nantian had done this to protect her feelings and even let Wu Han keep the truth. Her eyes became red again. What had she done to deserve such a man who could easily produce five hundred million for her?

"Xiaoshan, you know I didn't want to hide it from you. It's just that I didn't want us to have this gap."

Seeing Yue Xiaoshan's changed gaze, Su Nantian frowned slightly. He just wanted to play around with Yue Xiaoshan. But now, her eyes looked at him like a high-ranking official—this fundamentally destroyed his original intention.

"Ha! You're imagining too much. It's just five hundred million. Do you think I, Yue Xiaoshan, would be moved by it? You're thinking too much."

Suddenly, Yue Xiaoshan's face lost all expression and returned to her icy beauty.

Actually, Su Nantian's ability limit had always been a mystery in Yue Xiaoshan's mind. After all, Su Nantian had given her so many surprises.

Not only did he crush everyone with his strength, but he could also repel assassins. Now, casually producing five hundred million hadn't exceeded her cognitive range.

The reason she had been moved was simply because Su Nantian had considered her feelings. This man who had turned the tide and still cared about her emotions made her feel a different kind of sentiment. But she masked it on the surface.

"Hey, I say Xiaoshan, don't be like this. It's five hundred million! How can you not care about it?"

Su Nantian looked at Yue Xiaoshan's indifferent face, confused. He thought this girl had changed too quickly.

"Hmph."

Yue Xiaoshan gave him a triumphant smile, then her icy beauty vanished.

Chapter 336: Going Around in Circles

Throughout the journey, Yue Xiaoshan continued to examine the reports and occasionally furrowed her brows before relaxing them. Her eyes, filled with cunning, looked at Su Nantian.

"Xiaoshan."

Su Nantian suddenly called out to Yue Xiaoshan.

Yue Xiaoshan thought he had noticed her peeking and instinctively trembled. She quickly turned around, pretending to be calm.

"What... what's wrong?"

Su Nantian smiled mischievously. "Nothing, you all need to go to the meeting. I want to take a nap."

Yue Xiaoshan nodded. "Okay, go ahead. I'll call you after the meeting."

"Alright."

After Su Nantian took the elevator away, Yue Xiaoshan looked seriously at Wu Han and whispered a few words.

Wu Han's expression was fascinating—surprised, astonished, then understanding. Finally, she ran to a nearby office and operated on a computer, printing out a paper.

The paper clearly stated: Mr. Su Nantian invested five hundred million in the company and would hold 11% of New Yue Group's shares, becoming the second-largest shareholder!

Remember, although Yue Xiaoshan currently held 51% of the shares, she herself only had 11%, and the remaining 40% was her father Yue Han's. Yue Xiaoshan's intention was clear—she wanted to give all her shares to Su Nantian.

Don't underestimate these shares. Their value was about five hundred million, and they would also make Su Nantian the second-largest shareholder of New Yue Group, second only to Chairman Yue Han. If he wished, he could directly take over the position of President.

If it were anyone else, Yue Xiaoshan would never have trusted them so much. But since Su Nantian had invested and helped, she was willing to do this.

Two hours later, Yue Xiaoshan's meeting ended. Wu Han had already arranged the banquet hall below, with food and drinks ready and employees seated—very lively.

"Everyone, welcome the person who invested five hundred million to save New Yue. The main character of this banquet, Su Nantian! Everyone, welcome with applause!"

At the evening's victory banquet, Yue Xiaoshan changed into a white pleated skirt, elevating her temperament another level.

She smiled at all New Yue employees. This was a lesson she had learned after the previous class reunion—holding a banquet meant including all employees, not having any class consciousness.

"Uh, what's wrong?"

Hearing Yue Xiaoshan mention his name, Su Nantian, who was eating happily at the table, first stared in confusion. Then Yue Xiaoshan explained that the person who had invested five hundred million was himself, almost making her nose twist.

He glared at Yue Xiaoshan on the stage. That expression clearly said: Why did you do this? Holding a victory banquet is fine, but why bring me up?

But Yue Xiaoshan's smile was clearly conveying: You wanted to be a nameless hero? I won't let you succeed.

Su Nantian sighed, shaking his head. What was this? The lighting technician has a problem? Why are you shining on me?

Feeling the lights suddenly dim and all lighting focused on himself, Su Nantian glared at the person who had specifically gone to the control room and instructed the lighting technician—was it Wu Han? They must have conspired beforehand.

At this moment, under the expectant gaze of everyone, Su Nantian was stuck and had no choice but to reluctantly stand up.

He had stood in countless places where he was the center of attention, but standing on a stage was his first time.

The thunderous applause from all the employees echoed like thunder. After all, he had saved their jobs. He was unusually timid now.

"Everyone, quiet down. Let our main character speak a few words."

Yue Xiaoshan's position in the company was undeniable. She only needed to say one sentence with a microphone, and the entire hall fell silent.

Su Nantian took the ice cream-like item Yue Xiaoshan handed him. Honestly, this was his first time holding a microphone.

"Ahem, actually, there's nothing to say. Enjoy your food and have fun. Work hard in the future. After all, New Yue's path ahead will be led by General Manager Xiaoshan."

Su Nantian spoke some official words. In front of so many employees, he had to be more restrained. At least, he couldn't act like a second-rate person and tell them to have fun.

Seeing Su Nantian forced to be serious for once, Yue Xiaoshan smiled slightly. As soon as Su Nantian finished speaking, she stepped forward and took the microphone from him.

She first looked at Su Nantian with a complex gaze, then whispered: "There's one more thing I forgot to tell everyone. Today, Mr. Su saved New Yue and generously invested five hundred million for our company. Everyone knows New Yue's rules..."

Yue Xiaoshan said, making a pause. But Su Nantian suddenly had an ominous feeling.

"Now I announce that Mr. Su has taken over 11% of my shares, becoming the second-largest shareholder of New Yue and the new President of New Yue Group. Everyone, welcome with applause!"

Before Yue Xiaoshan finished speaking, the hall was in uproar. Even Su Nantian stood up first and repeatedly objected: "No, no! Xiaoshan, you're trying to kill me!"
