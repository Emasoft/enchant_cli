Good, Su Nantian had long foreseen this and had Qi Yinzhen's group monitoring Leng Boxiong's movements.

Su Nantian immediately contacted Qi Yinzhen, saying, “Qi Yinzhen, tell me where Leng Boxiong is now. Wen Ran and Wu You'er have both been kidnapped by him. Have you seen where they are?”

Unexpectedly, Qi Yinzhen replied, “We have been monitoring Leng Boxiong, but after he met someone today, there has been no movement. We have no idea where he took them.”

Su Nantian let out a cold snort; he had not expected Leng Boxiong to hide so effectively this time.

“Fine, continue monitoring him. I will go see Zhang Bao.”

Su Nantian believed Leng Boxiong must have employed a ruse to divert attention, knowing they would send people to watch him. Thus, he avoided contact with Wen Ran and Wu You'er, leaving Su Nantian in the dark about their whereabouts. Fortunately, besides the Shadow Assassins Organization, Su Nantian also had Zhang Bao, a local power.

The Shadow Assassins were highly professional, but in this region, Zhang Bao’s influence was greater. Moreover, Zhang Bao's network extended wider.

“Big brother, what do you need?” Zhang Bao answered Su Nantian’s call almost immediately.

“Wen Ran and Wu You'er have been kidnapped by Leng Boxiong. We still don’t know where they are. Mobilize your people to investigate and see if there’s any information.”

Su Nantian spoke without hesitation, immediately relaying the situation.

“Damn it, I think Leng Boxiong doesn’t want to live anymore. How dare he kidnap our sister-in-law? Big brother, rest assured—I’ll mobilize my people right away to investigate.”

Zhang Bao sounded indignant. After all, he had long understood that aligning with Su Nantian was beneficial; Su Nantian’s affairs were his own, and ultimately he would reap the rewards.

After hanging up with Zhang Bao, Su Nantian did not return home but instead hailed a taxi and went back to the Wen family residence.

Su Nantian knocked on the Wen household’s door again. A voice inside replied, “Who is it? It's so late.”

Clearly, this was the housekeeper’s voice. She had been there for years and naturally favored the Wen family after hearing Su Nantian’s argument with them.

“You’re back again? You didn’t even finish your fight before leaving, did you?” The housekeeper spoke unkindly.

After all, she had worked for the Wen family for over a decade and felt affection for them. Naturally, she sided with the Wen family after Su Nantian’s quarrel.

“I’m here to see Wen Hai. I have something to discuss with him.”

Su Nantian said this without heeding the housekeeper’s obstruction. He had grown tired of wasting time at the door and pushed inside.

“Hey, you haven’t even been let in yet. You can’t enter without their permission.”

The housekeeper kept shouting after Su Nantian.

But Su Nantian paid no heed to her.

Her shouts woke Wen Hai, who was resting upstairs. He descended the stairs in his pajamas and said, “Why are you back so late? Didn’t you finish your argument yet? If you’ve changed your mind about our conditions, we can still talk.”

After hearing this, Su Nantian let out another cold snort. He had not expected Wen Hai to still be preoccupied with the Tiha Group.

“I’ve come to tell you that Wen Ran was kidnapped.”

Su Nantian said coldly.

Wen Hai widened his eyes and replied, “What do you mean? Do you think I did it? Wen Ran is my daughter. Even if she’s ungrateful, I would never send people to kidnap her.”

After hearing Wen Hai’s words, Su Nantian was furious. He said, “Wen Hai, your own daughter has been kidnapped. I came only to inform you. Originally, I wanted to ask you to help me find Wen Ran, but now you’re saying this. Are you only trying to distance yourself and protect your own skin? Don’t you feel even a little concern for Wen Ran being kidnapped?”

After saying this, Wen Hai was stunned.

Su Nantian had come to find Wen Hai in the first place to mobilize his connections and help search for Wen Ran. After all, the Wen family had some influence in Hangcheng and might have heard something. However, Su Nantian hadn’t expected Wen Hai to show no concern for Wen Ran’s kidnapping at all, instead constantly trying to distance himself. He thought Su Nantian suspected him of abducting Wen Ran.

“Wen Ran is truly unfortunate to have a father like you. Fine, I’ll pretend I never came. You don’t need to bother with this matter anymore. From now on, Wen Ran and your Wen family should have no relation. Also, you said earlier about that matter—I will never agree to it. Give up this idea. From now on, don’t bother Wen Ran anymore or try any means; otherwise, I will mercilessly destroy your Wen family.”

After saying this, Su Nantian turned around angrily and left the Wen household.

Inside the Wen family, only Wen Hai remained on the stairs, stunned. He had never expected things to turn out this way.

Chapter 407: Mercenary Organization

Before arriving at the Wen household, Su Nantian had already messaged Qi Yeyu to drive over and pick him up because his car had been smashed earlier, leaving him without transportation.

Moreover, Su Nantian had planned to find Leng Boxiong all along. However, he hadn’t expected returning to the Wen family would result in this situation. Thus, he decided to go directly to Leng Boxiong.

Qi Yeyu acted quickly and arrived at the Wen household in his car immediately.

As Su Nantian left the Wen family’s gate, he saw Qi Yeyu driving over to pick him up.

“What is Leng Boxiong doing now?” Su Nantian asked immediately after getting into the car, wanting to grasp Leng Boxiong’s current movements and understand the situation.

Qi Yeyu said while driving, “We followed your instructions to monitor Leng Boxiong. We assigned people around him; wherever he went, our people followed. Tonight, we noticed he met a group of people. And this group seems familiar to us—they are people from the underworld.”

The “people from the underworld” Qi Yeyu referred to were similar in nature to their Shadow Assassins Organization, likely a group that took on missions.

“If we’re not mistaken, this organization is no ordinary one. They are even more formidable than us. They must be a mercenary group.”

Qi Yeyu then took out a tablet and handed it to Su Nantian.

“Look at this information. This is what we investigated about them. It’s an international mercenary organization composed entirely of retired special forces from around the world. They take any job for enough money. I think this time it was directly aimed at you.”

Qi Yeyu said while displaying the information.

Su Nantian looked at the data on the tablet. From this, it was clear that they were a highly professional mercenary unit. Their members came from special forces worldwide, each with their own specialties.

“Leng Boxiong truly invested heavily in this. Hiring such a group must have cost a lot.”

After reviewing the data, Su Nantian let out a cold snort and said with a smile.

“Indeed, it’s expensive. Moreover, this mercenary organization doesn’t take regular cases. Leng Boxiong managed to hire them for this, so he must have paid a premium; otherwise, they wouldn’t usually take such cases.”

Qi Yeyu said and flipped through the data on the tablet.

“This is what we obtained about their pricing. Each mission usually costs around fifty million. And the price increases with the difficulty of the task. I heard Leng Boxiong probably put his entire fortune into this, about one hundred million.”

“This sounds like a astronomical sum. However, for Leng Boxiong, it’s still worth it because if he truly succeeds with this mercenary group, the value of Tiha Group he regains would be more than just one hundred million.”

Su Nantian said this with ease, as if he didn’t take the international mercenary organization seriously at all.

“Boss, this international mercenary group is no easy opponent. Shouldn’t we prepare a strategy?” Qi Yeyu, despite his confidence in his own abilities, felt some trepidation toward this globally renowned mercenary group. Although Qi Yeyu knew Su Nantian’s abilities were formidable, he felt that facing such a group in Hangcheng would still be difficult.

“Preparing strategies? That’s unnecessary,” Su Nantian said, completely relaxed. He didn’t care about this so-called international mercenary group because no one could match him.

Even the most formidable international mercenary groups couldn’t compare to the members of the Dragon Group.

But this was known only to Su Nantian, so Qi Yeyu felt that Su Nantian might be too careless.

“Boss, I think we should take this seriously. We can’t be complacent. These people are truly powerful. At least, I wouldn’t be their match.”

Qi Yeyu still tried to persuade Su Nantian, hoping he would take the matter seriously.

Su Nantian waved his hand and said, “You don’t need to be so tense. I have it under control. The main issue now is that Leng Boxiong isn’t with Wen Ran and Wu You'er. He must have taken them to another place. We need to find out where that is quickly.”

In truth, Su Nantian had no interest in this international mercenary group. He thought they were no match for him, so regardless of Qi Yeyu’s reminders, he didn’t care much. This made Qi Yeyu somewhat uncomfortable; he felt Su Nantian was too careless.

Although he admitted he couldn’t match Su Nantian, Qi Yeyu felt that Su Nantian wasn’t yet capable of facing such a powerful international mercenary group. However, he couldn’t say much because of his current position and had already spoken about the matter, but Su Nantian still didn’t care.

“We’ve assigned people to search. However, our side has been monitoring Leng Boxiong all the time but never found any communication with other places. This is quite difficult.”

Qi Yeyu continued to report their situation.

“You continue searching. I’ve also asked Zhang Bao to look for people in Hangcheng. After all, he’s a local power and gets more information than you do. Let’s see if he can find any leads.”

Su Nantian remained calm, which was rare for him. It wasn’t that he wasn’t worried; it was because he knew worrying wouldn’t help. The more anxious he became, the more his mind would be confused, and his judgment would become worse. Therefore, it was better to stay clear-headed and analyze the current situation, which might help him find Leng Boxiong’s location quickly.

“However, even if we don’t find their location immediately,” Su Nantian suddenly said.

“Why? Don’t you plan to save Wen Ran and Wu You'er?” Qi Yeyu asked curiously, unsure of Su Nantian’s meaning.

“Of course I do. But they won’t be in danger, because Leng Boxiong kidnapped them mainly to use them as leverage against me to regain Tiha Group. Therefore, he won’t do anything to them before we negotiate.”

Chapter 408: Nighttime Visit to Leng’s Mansion

Su Nantian's words were indeed correct. If the kidnapping was truly done by Leng Boxiong, he had kidnapped Wen Ran and Wu You'er mainly to use them as leverage against Su Nantian to regain Tiha Group. Therefore, before the negotiation, he wouldn’t do anything to Wen Ran and Wu You'er, ensuring their safety.

However, Qi Yeyu furrowed his brow and said to Su Nantian, “But Leng Boxiong also has a son named Leng Zhifei. I think he might have ulterior motives toward Wen Ran.”

Upon hearing Qi Yeyu’s words, Su Nantian was startled. He had almost forgotten about Leng Zhifei.

Indeed, Leng Boxiong wouldn’t do anything to Wen Ran and Wu You'er, but if it was Leng Zhifei, it was hard to say. He might do something to Wen Ran and Wu You'er.

“Damn, we should hurry and drive. I almost forgot about this. Let’s go find Qi Yinzhen first. Tonight, I’ll meet Leng Boxiong.”

Su Nantian became anxious now. The thought of Leng Zhifei made him feel厌恶.

After hearing Su Nantian’s command, Qi Yeyu immediately sped up the car.

Soon, they met with Qi Yinzhen.

At this time, Qi Yinzhen and his group were guarding the entrance of a residential area. Upon seeing Qi Yeyu’s car, they waved their hands to signal them to stop.

“Did Leng Boxiong stay here?” Su Nantian asked Qi Yinzhen immediately after getting out of the car.

“Yes, he’s here. But there's no sign of Wen Ran and Wu You'er. Leng Boxiong didn’t bring anyone back,” Qi Yinzhen reported the situation he had been monitoring to Su Nantian.

“Is Leng Zhifei here?” Su Nantian asked immediately.

Upon hearing this, Qi Yinzhen was startled. They had overlooked something; they were only watching Leng Boxiong but forgot about Leng Zhifei. They had seen Leng Zhifei once today, and since then, they hadn’t seen him again.

“Leng Zhifei appeared once today. After that, we haven’t seen him. But Leng Boxiong’s car returning home didn’t have Leng Zhifei in it,” Qi Yinzhen said immediately.

Upon seeing Qi Yinzhen’s expression, Su Nantian understood what had happened. They were only watching Leng Boxiong and forgot about the existence of Leng Zhifei, allowing him to escape their sight and do something else.

“Boss, this was our mistake. Please punish me,” Qi Yinzhen said straightforwardly to Su Nantian.

Su Nantian shook his head and walked up to pat Qi Yinzhen’s shoulder, saying, “I’ve always said we are brothers. This mistake is indeed regrettable, but it’s not worth punishing you. Besides, what's the point of punishment between brothers? I’ve already said that we are brothers and not subordinates.”

After hearing Su Nantian’s words, it wasn’t just Qi Yinzhen but also Qi Yeyu and the other members of the Shadow Assassins who were involved in this surveillance. Upon hearing Su Nantian’s words, they were deeply moved.

“Good thing I had a backup plan. I’ve already sent Zhang Bao to investigate, so he should find out Leng Zhifei’s movements soon. Leng Zhifei isn’t a god; he must be seen somewhere. Let’s go talk to Leng Boxiong first and see what kind of person he is.”

With that, Su Nantian immediately walked forward. Qi Yinzhen and the others followed him toward Leng Boxiong’s mansion.

After the mansion door opened, it was a housekeeper who let them in. Upon seeing Su Nantian and his group, she looked very alert and asked fearfully, “Who are you? Why did you come so late?”

“Don’t be afraid. I’m here to see Leng Boxiong. Tell him my name is Su Nantian; he’ll know immediately.”

Su Nantian didn’t force his way in but asked the housekeeper to inform Leng Boxiong.

“Oh… you wait a moment. I’ll go ask the master’s opinion. If he doesn’t want to see you, please leave immediately.”

The housekeeper said and closed the door before entering.

“Why are you being so polite to him? We should just break in. This is definitely Leng Boxiong’s doing; there's no need to give him face.”

Qi Yeyu, whose temper was more explosive, felt uneasy now that they were at Leng Boxiong’s doorstep but were blocked outside. He naturally felt uneasy.

“Wait a moment, I want to see what Leng Boxiong can do. We’re standing here as a pressure on him, giving him some tension.”

Suddenly, Su Nantian looked up and saw someone looking down from the second-floor window. If he wasn’t mistaken, this person was definitely Leng Boxiong.

Su Nantian couldn’t help but smile. It seemed Leng Boxiong was secretly watching if he had truly arrived.

After a while, the door opened again. The housekeeper told Su Nantian’s group, “The master said you can come in, but since there are too many of you, only two people may enter. The rest should wait outside.”

This condition meant nothing to Su Nantian. No matter how many people he brought in, if he wanted to do something to Leng Boxiong, it would be effortless.

“Everyone else wait outside. Qi Yinzhen, you come in with me.”

Su Nantian thought that Qi Yinzhen was more rational. Clearly, within the Shadow Assassins organization, he was a strategic figure. Although his combat skills were among the top in the group, it was he who managed the organization.

Su Nantian and Qi Yinzhen immediately entered Leng Boxiong’s current mansion. Upon entering, they saw that Leng Boxiong was already seated on the sofa in the living room waiting for them.

“Ah, I didn’t expect your visit. What do you need from me? Have you taken my Tiha Group already, and now you want my house too?” Leng Boxiong looked calm and composed.

Su Nantian smiled and sat down on the sofa beside him, saying, “I came here for what purpose? You don’t know? Don’t play dumb. Tell me your conditions.”

Su Nantian directly said this, letting Leng Boxiong propose his terms to avoid going through the motions later.

“What do you mean? What did you come here for tonight?” Unexpectedly, Leng Boxiong seemed completely unaware and even asked back.

“What do I mean? You’ve already come this far, so you still want to play dumb with me? I said, if you have any conditions, just say them. Are you afraid?” Su Nantian continued.

But Leng Boxiong still looked confused.

Qi Yinzhen observed the scene and felt something was off.

Chapter 409: Conditions

Su Nantian started to realize that Leng Boxiong was playing dumb, and no matter how he hinted, Leng Boxiong never admitted to the incident.

“Leng Boxiong, don’t play dumb with me. What did you do today? Don’t you know?” Su Nantian said again, his patience now exhausted. He had been trying to stay calm and speak rationally with Leng Boxiong, but now that Leng Boxiong was playing dumb, his temper flared.

“Su Nantian, I think something is wrong. Look at Leng Boxiong’s expression—he doesn’t seem to be faking it. And since he kidnapped Wen Ran and Wu You'er, he wanted to use them as leverage against you to regain Tiha Group. Now that you’ve come, why don’t you just admit it?” Qi Yinzhen whispered to Su Nantian, sharing his thoughts.

Su Nantian furrowed his brows. He also felt something was strange, but he didn’t know why Leng Boxiong kept playing dumb and avoided his questions as if he wasn’t the one who kidnapped them.

“I think this might be related to Leng Zhifei. Leng Zhifei hasn’t appeared today, and he might have secretly kidnapped Wen Ran and Wu You'er,” Qi Yinzhen said.

Su Nantian nodded, thinking it was possible. He didn’t know what Leng Zhifei was up to, but Leng Boxiong’s behavior seemed genuinely unaware of the incident.

Earlier, Su Nantian turned to Leng Boxiong and said, “Where is Leng Zhifei now? Tell me.”

Leng Boxiong shook his head and said, “Children grow up; they go where they want. I don’t know where he went. Besides, he’s been staying out for days; I’ve stopped caring.”

“But today, Leng Zhifei did meet with you. Didn’t he tell you where he was going?” Qi Yinzhen asked immediately.

“You’re monitoring me. You’ve already taken Tiha Group. Why are you still watching me? Are you afraid I’ll take it back?” Leng Boxiong said angrily after hearing Qi Yinzhen’s words.

“I haven’t even gotten angry yet, but you’re already upset. Tell me where Leng Zhifei is now. If you tell me, this might be unrelated to you, and I won’t take it out on you. But if you protect your foolish son, I’ll deal with both of us,” Su Nantian said without hesitation. If Leng Boxiong had done anything to Wen Ran and Wu You'er, he would do everything possible to torment him until he wished for death.

“Tell me clearly what’s going on. I don’t know what happened. Did Leng Zhifei offend you?” Leng Boxiong looked anxious, for he knew Su Nantian’s words weren’t empty threats.

Su Nantian sighed and nodded, saying, “Fine, since you want to know, I’ll tell you. Leng Zhifei contacted the international mercenary organization we met earlier and kidnapped Wen Ran and Wu You'er. We don’t know where they are now.”

Actually, Su Nantian wasn’t entirely certain this was connected to Leng Zhifei and the international mercenary organization. However, all evidence pointed toward these two aspects, and he needed to threaten Leng Boxiong here to find out where Wen Ran and Wu You'er were.

“What? This brat did such a thing? Impossible,” Leng Boxiong said, extremely surprised. It seemed he truly didn’t know.

“Did you and your son plan this to regain Tiha Group?” Su Nantian smiled and said.

“I do want to regain Tiha Group. It’s been my life's work for years, so of course I want it back. But this incident has nothing to do with me. And I don’t know if it was Leng Zhifei who did it. I can help you contact him, but I have a condition.”

Leng Boxiong said this and his eyes flickered slightly.

“Say it. I’ll consider it, but first you must tell me where Leng Zhifei is,” Su Nantian nodded, agreeing to his request.

“But if it was really Leng Zhifei who did this, I hope you won’t harm him. I know you’re ruthless and would definitely act against him. But I hope you’ll let him live. He’s the only child in our family, and I want to continue the lineage.”

Leng Boxiong said this, and his expression looked much older. After all, he was a father now, and with Leng Zhifei in danger, he couldn’t help but protect him.

“But you must know that if it was really Leng Zhifei, he touched two women. Do you think I would let him go? Or if it were you, would you let him go?” Su Nantian asked in return.

“If you can let him go, I’ll never again think about Tiha Group. I just hope you don’t kill him or make him suffer,” Leng Boxiong said, even appearing somewhat humble.

This was the first time Su Nantian had seen Leng Boxiong like this. Since he met Leng Boxiong, the latter had always been aloof and superior. He never expected to see him like this.

“I agree. Now, call Leng Zhifei immediately. If you can persuade him to return Wen Ran and Wu You'er, I promise not to harm her. But if he still refuses, I can only guarantee that they are alive when you get them.”

After hearing Su Nantian’s words, Leng Boxiong nodded immediately and said, “That’s enough. I’ll call him now.”

Saying this, Leng Boxiong immediately took out his phone and dialed Leng Zhifei’s number. After ringing for a long time, Leng Zhifei finally answered.

“Dad, what’s wrong? I’m busy. If there’s nothing important, don’t call me.”

Leng Zhifei said on the other end.

“Zhifei, where are you now? Did you kidnap Wen Ran and Wu You'er? If you did, bring them back immediately. Su Nantian isn’t someone you can mess with.”

Leng Boxiong said directly.

“How did you know about this? I told you, it’s none of your business. I’ll use my own methods to punish Su Nantian and regain our Tiha Group.”

Chapter 410: Outskirts Warehouse

Leng Zhifei’s words clearly confirmed that he had indeed kidnapped Wen Ran and Wu You'er.

After learning the definite answer, Su Nantian felt relieved. He knew what kind of person Leng Zhifei was; with his talent, he could never come up with anything.

“You foolish son! What have you been doing all day? Why did you act recklessly? You kidnapped Wen Ran and Wu You'er, leaving us no way out. These two women are the most important to Su Nantian; you’ve angered his wrath. Bring them back immediately, bring them back! There’s still time to negotiate. But if Su Nantian comes looking for you, then it's over.”

Leng Boxiong spoke to Leng Zhifei on the phone, trying to persuade him to return Wen Ran and Wu You'er.

“You’re just getting old. Old age has made you lose all your courage. Did Su Nantian scare you so much that you’re afraid? Kidnapping these two women, we have a chance to regain Tiha Group. It’s precisely because they are important to him that he might exchange the entire Tiha Group for them. Do you think you can regain it by just enduring hardship? It’s too hard.”

Leng Zhifei grew more and more agitated, speaking louder.

He continued shouting, “It’s too hard to start from scratch. You’re no longer the person you were. Tiha Group is such a big business; you gave it up for one bet. Now we need to find another way, take a shortcut. The more dangerous the path, the greater the reward. Don’t you understand this yet!”

“Your son is really crazy. I only bet to get him back. Do you know what methods Su Nantian uses? I’ve even hired the Shadow Assassins, but they couldn’t handle him. Do you think keeping Wen Ran and Wu You'er will get his weakness?”

Leng Boxiong continued persuading, but Leng Zhifei was unresponsive.

“Of course the Shadow Assassins couldn’t do it. But we met an international mercenary organization today, right? I’ve already offered two hundred million to have Su Nantian killed. Tiha Group is worth more than two hundred million. This money was well spent. Once Su Nantian comes for Wen Ran and Wu You'er, I’ll have the international mercenary group kill him. Then we can easily take back the company’s shares with a little trick.”

As Leng Zhifei spoke confidently, Su Nantian directly walked up to Leng Boxiong and snatched the phone from him.

“Leng Zhifei, you want me to come find you? Tell me your address. I’ll go find you now and let your international mercenary group wait for me.”

“Su Nantian, why are you with my father?” Leng Zhifei asked in surprise upon hearing Su Nantian’s voice.

“Why do you care why I’m with your father? You wanted to find me, right? Now I’ve come to you. But I’ll tell you this: if you do anything bad to Wen Ran and Wu You'er, I won’t show mercy.”

Su Nantian said this with great authority, making Leng Zhifei shiver involuntarily. He hadn’t expected Su Nantian to suddenly speak with him.

“Okay, fine. The outskirts warehouse. Come here. I’m sure you’re familiar with it. I’ll wait for you here, waiting for you to come and die.”

After saying this, Leng Zhifei hung up the phone.

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian let out a smile. Leng Zhifei truly had some brains; he chose to keep the captives in a warehouse on the outskirts of Tiha Group. It was clearly under Su Nantian’s nose, but it was precisely this place that Su Nantian had overlooked.

“Qi Yinzhen, let’s go. Let’s visit Leng Zhifei at the warehouse on the outskirts.”

After saying this, Su Nantian threw the phone to Leng Boxiong and turned to leave.

“Su Nantian, you did promise me not to harm Leng Zhifei’s life!” Leng Boxiong hurriedly said behind him.

“I did promise, and I will keep it. But other things I can’t guarantee. And if he truly did something to Wen Ran and Wu You'er, I can’t guarantee the first part either.”

After saying this, Su Nantian and Qi Yinzhen left Leng Boxiong’s mansion and met up with Qi Yeyu outside. They all got into the car and headed toward the Tiha Group warehouse on the outskirts.

It was already late at night, and there were no other vehicles on the road to the outskirts. Apart from Su Nantian’s group, there was no one else.

At this moment, Su Nantian's phone suddenly rang.

“Zhang Bao, did you get any information?” Su Nantian asked, hoping to gain more details from Zhang Bao.

“Big brother, I’ve already assigned people to investigate. Tonight they met Leng Zhifei at a bar. He seemed happy, saying he was about to regain Tiha Group. I think this matter might be related to Leng Zhifei, and later someone said that Leng Zhifei seemed to be heading toward the outskirts.”

After hearing Zhang Bao’s words, Su Nantian nodded. This matched the information he had received.

“Good, I know. You don’t need to worry about it anymore; I’m on my way to the outskirts now.”

After saying this, Su Nantian hung up. Now he could be 100% certain that Wen Ran and Wu You'er were likely held in the warehouse on the outskirts. This was not Leng Zhifei’s ruse to divert attention.

The car drove at high speed on the road. Within twenty minutes, they arrived at the Tiha Group warehouse on the outskirts.

Looking around, it was pitch black and showed no signs of anyone being there.

“Be careful. They might have set up an ambush here. After all, they are an international mercenary organization and are skilled at night battles,” Qi Yinzhen observed the surroundings and said cautiously.

After all, people like them rarely fought at night. However, there were those who were more agile in the dark.

When Qi Yinzhen suggested sending one of the Shadow Assassins to check the situation, he was rejected by Su Nantian.

Because everyone on site was less familiar with the night than Su Nantian. His eyes, after cultivation, could clearly see in the dark.

Su Nantian now saw this place as if it were daytime. Therefore, no one was more suited to adapt to this environment than him.

Chapter 411: Breaking the Ambush

Su Nantian observed the surroundings and had already uncovered the ambush set up nearby.

There were four hidden sentries around the warehouse. Since Su Nantian’s group had arrived, their guns were already aimed at them, waiting for orders to attack.

Su Nantian knew that if they advanced recklessly, they would become targets.

“You all stay here and don’t move. I’ll take care of them,” Su Nantian said, knowing this task was very difficult. Only he could silently eliminate these sentries.

“Boss, be careful,” Qi Yinzhen said worriedly. After all, the environment was very dark now, and he feared Su Nantian would be at a disadvantage in this situation. After all, they were in the dark and he was in the light.

Su Nantian replied calmly, patting his shoulder and saying, “Don’t worry. I never fight without a plan.”

After saying this, Su Nantian’s figure flashed forward at lightning speed toward the first sentry position.

Although they were wearing night vision goggles, it was still different from daytime. Plus, Su Nantian’s movements were extremely fast, and they couldn’t see his movement trails.
