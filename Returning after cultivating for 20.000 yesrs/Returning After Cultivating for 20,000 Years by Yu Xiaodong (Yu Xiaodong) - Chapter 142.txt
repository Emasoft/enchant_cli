“Alright, alright, stop arguing. Master Wu You'er just specifically ordered us to hurry and get the food ready quickly! Otherwise, how will we explain it when her people arrive?”

The final speaker was another servant who defused the situation by invoking Wu You'er, finally silencing the two arguing servants. They both resumed their work with haste, determined to prepare the meal before being reprimanded by those above.

They continued their labor, while Su Nantian, hidden atop the roof, fell into deep contemplation.

He had overheard every word of the kitchen staff’s conversation and felt an inexplicable unease. Earlier, it had been stated that Wu You'er suffered from severe anorexia and could not eat anything. Moreover, Lv Li had mentioned that Wu You'er relied on nutritional injections to survive. Yet now she was eating, five meals a day with lavish dishes—this was nothing short of gluttony!

Had Wu You'er truly begun to eat, or was there some hidden truth she had not revealed?

The more Su Nantian pondered, the more he felt torn and anxious about Wu You'er.

But these people had said someone would come to collect the food later. If he followed that person, he could find out exactly where Wu You'er was.

With this thought, Su Nantian’s mood slightly eased.

At first, he had assumed it would take a long time to locate Wu You'er. His initial plan was merely to gather information in the kitchen, but he had not expected such a fortunate encounter.

It was truly fate’s blessing!

After this realization, Su Nantian immediately held his breath and carefully concealed his presence. He waited patiently for the person to arrive.

His expression softened slightly after this action.

Soon, the kitchen staff finished preparing the meals. Seeing this, Su Nantian immediately focused his full attention, ready to follow them at any moment.

But the staff showed no intention of leaving. Instead, they placed all the food into a single food box. After this, they set it on the table and returned to cooking.

What was going on? Why hadn’t they taken the food yet? No one had come to collect it from the door.

Su Nantian thought in silence, his brows furrowing involuntarily.

If no one came to take the food, wouldn’t his plan fail?

This thought darkened Su Nantian’s expression again. His eyes were clouded with concern.

Just as he was growing restless, a man finally appeared at the door. He wore a black suit—Su Nantian knew these were the uniforms of Wu Family bodyguards.

Was it really necessary to use a bodyguard for such a simple task?

Su Nantian watched the young guard lift the food box. The others merely observed his actions without interfering. This made Su Nantian’s mind race with questions.

Why was it necessary to send a dedicated person instead of having the kitchen staff deliver it?

This thought revealed a detail. Su Nantian’s eyes widened, and his expression turned serious again.

He understood.

The four words formed clearly in Su Nantian’s mind.

This method indicated that Wu You'er’s condition was extremely poor, perhaps even dire. Otherwise, why would they go to such lengths to conceal and protect it?

The bodyguard’s delivery was merely a cover.

With this realization, Su Nantian’s tense expression returned, and even his fists clenched involuntarily. He longed to follow the bodyguard immediately to check on Wu You'er’s condition.

Chapter 711: Finding Wu You'er

“Is the food ready?”

The bodyguard picked up the food box and asked the kitchen staff.

“Yes! It’s all ready. Everything is prepared, including the soup.”

The sharp-tongued kitchen staff nodded carefully and smiled nervously. She clearly feared the bodyguard.

“Hmph.”

The bodyguard nodded in satisfaction, then lifted the food box and prepared to leave.

Su Nantian had been deep in thought about this matter. When he saw the bodyguard beginning to leave, he quickly pushed aside his thoughts and hurriedly followed.

This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity he could not miss.

As for Wu You'er’s condition, seeing her would clarify everything.

With this thought, Su Nantian held his breath and moved cautiously behind the bodyguard. He kept a careful distance, moving silently. He had to watch for other Wu Family security personnel while ensuring he did not lose sight of the bodyguard.

Su Nantian focused his mind and followed closely, carefully hiding behind the bodyguard without being noticed.

Although he encountered several security personnel along the way, he managed to avoid detection without incident.

Su Nantian followed the bodyguard through a series of winding paths for some time before finally arriving at a small independent house. Upon seeing it, Su Nantian felt some confusion.

But when he noticed several bodyguards standing at the door, his suspicions were confirmed—this was undoubtedly where Wu You'er was being held.

The thought of Wu You'er so close made Su Nantian’s heart race, his pulse quickening. His entire body felt alive, and even his blood seemed to boil!

He longed to rush in immediately and rescue Wu You'er, but reason restrained him.

Instead of rushing in recklessly, he carefully observed the surroundings and any potential security personnel hiding nearby.

Yet this feeling was unbearable. Though he knew he could not act rashly, the thought of Wu You'er inside made it impossible for him to remain calm.

It was like telling a starving man that there were fine wines and delicacies inside—how could he stay calm? The hungry man would surely long to rush in and devour everything!

The bodyguard approached, greeted the security personnel, then pressed a sequence of numbers on the door and entered.

Su Nantian watched the bodyguard’s actions from a distance, using his sharp eyes to memorize the code. He planned to use it when needed.

But with so many people guarding the entrance and patrolling, Su Nantian felt it would be difficult.

How could he sneak in?

This thought made Su Nantian feel troubled and frustrated, but now that he had found Wu You'er’s location, it was almost within reach.

How could he accept failure now?

He continued waiting by the door, carefully observing the security patrol routes and shift changes. He persisted in searching for an opportunity to slip inside.

But despite waiting until the bodyguard entered and exited, Su Nantian never found a chance.

“Damn it.”

Su Nantian muttered under his breath, helplessly watching the perfect opportunity slip away. With so many people around, he could not risk drawing attention and had to patiently wait.

Time passed slowly, especially when waiting.

But Su Nantian forced himself to stay quiet and composed, avoiding reckless actions.

As time passed, he still found no solution.

His anxiety deepened. At this moment, he wished he were Sun Wukong with the ability to transform into anything.

But these things were impossible, so Su Nantian had no choice but to suppress his anxious heart and continue waiting for an opportunity.

The security personnel remained vigilant, constantly scanning their surroundings. Su Nantian could not even risk making a sound, let alone slip in unnoticed.

Continuing like this was no solution. Su Nantian had finally managed to enter, but he could not waste time waiting.

Su Nantian thought silently and clenched his fists, making a decision in his mind.

Ah! Su Nantian suddenly had an idea.

His lips curled slightly, and his eyes flashed with a meaningful glint. He had found a plan.

Su Nantian retraced his steps and returned to the kitchen area.

The kitchen staff, now past mealtime, were more relaxed and engaged in gossip. However, Su Nantian did not pay attention to their conversations.

This time, he had a more important purpose.

He had not forgotten that the kitchen staff had mentioned Wu You'er now required five meals a day.

After waiting so long, it was already past dinner time. The night snack would soon arrive.

This was Su Nantian’s only chance today.

With this thought, his fingers curled into a fist.

He had now found the solution to his problem.

Soon, night snack time arrived. The kitchen staff resumed their work as usual, preparing the food.

Just like dinner, a dedicated bodyguard would come to collect it.

After the bodyguard arrived and took the food, Su Nantian followed him again, moving swiftly but carefully.

However, this time he did not simply trail behind the bodyguard as before. When they passed a rock garden, Su Nantian acted decisively, striking the bodyguard from behind and knocking him unconscious.

Su Nantian quickly removed the bodyguard’s uniform, swapped clothes with him, and even wore the Bluetooth device the guard had on his ear.

After finishing this, Su Nantian picked up the food box containing the night snack.

Chapter 712: Entering

“Wu You'er, I’m coming for you.”

Su Nantian smiled slightly, glanced at the food box in his hands, and whispered these words before a determined look replaced his expression.

Su Nantian followed the memory he had just formed and quickly returned to the small house where Wu You'er was held.

Since he wore the same uniform as the bodyguards, no one noticed anything unusual. Even the security personnel merely glanced at him briefly before returning their attention elsewhere.

Everything proceeded smoothly. Su Nantian took a step, then another—only one more step to reach the keypad.

At this moment, an security guard who had been patrolling stopped abruptly and looked at Su Nantian’s back. He asked with confusion, “Who are you? I don’t recognize you. Are you new?”

The security guard asked with bewilderment, his gaze now filled with suspicion.

Another security officer interjected, “Which squad are you from? You look unfamiliar.”

Su Nantian’s heart skipped a beat. He had anticipated everything except this final step being discovered!

His fists clenched tightly, the pressure so intense that his nails dug into his palm.

But Su Nantian had no time to care about these minor details. He urgently thought of how to respond to the suspicious security personnel.

“Who are you? Why aren’t you speaking?”

The security guard, not receiving an answer, grew more suspicious. One of them, impatient, took a step forward with a tone laced with impatience.

The others behind him placed their hands on the sides of their waists—where their weapons were. Clearly, they had prepared for any potential threat.

This was it! Su Nantian thought silently. He would rather fail than let this mission go to waste. He was ready to fight these security personnel if necessary.

At that moment, a loud noise echoed from within Wu You'er’s room. The sound was unmistakable—someone had thrown a chair to the ground.

The security guards’ attention immediately shifted to this noise, exchanging glances and growing anxious.

One of them said urgently, “What’s wrong with Miss Wu You'er? Why is she so angry?”

Su Nantian seized the opportunity and replied, “What’s there to say? She must be starving! That’s why she’s so angry about the night snack!”

“Ah! I need to deliver it immediately!”

Su Nantian added, “I was just transferred here. It’s normal for you to not recognize me. But if you need anything, I can deliver the night snack first. Otherwise, Miss Wu You'er will be angry again, and we’ll all suffer!”

Su Nantian’s words made the security guards exchange glances. They showed signs of concern and hesitation, but soon they decided to let him proceed.

After all, Wu You'er was still the head of the Wu Family, even if it was only a nominal position. Her status was undeniable, and they were merely low-ranking security guards who dared not offend her.

“Then hurry in! Quickly!”

After making their decision, the security guards did not further question Su Nantian but urged him to enter quickly.

Su Nantian nodded obediently and said, “Yes!” He then confidently pressed the code on the keypad. The security guards saw no signs of hesitation in him, and his accurate entry erased any remaining doubts about him.

After all, they would never have imagined that an outsider could know the code to Wu You'er’s room.

Moreover, they believed in the Wu Family’s strict security measures. If anyone had entered improperly, the outer guards would have immediately alerted them.

“Hurry in!”

With this thought, the security guards also set aside their suspicions and urged Su Nantian to enter quickly. They were worried he would delay and cause Wu You'er to become angry again.

“Ah! Yes!”

Su Nantian played the role of a compliant servant, appearing obedient. In reality, his lips curled slightly into a meaningful smile as he lowered his head.

He had succeeded.

It was a close call, but he had made it.

With the food box in hand, Su Nantian entered smoothly.

“Leave the food and you can go.”

As he pushed open the door, Wu You'er was sitting on the edge of the bed, her back to him.

Wu You'er made no move to turn around; she seemed unaffected by the outside world.

She spoke softly, “Leave it here. I’ll eat it.”

She remained silent after this, as if she had become a statue that could not move.

Her voice was weak, and from her back alone, it was clear she had lost a lot of weight.

Wu You'er must have suffered greatly these past days!

Su Nantian thought this silently.

“I’m Su Nantian.”

At this moment, he immediately revealed his identity.

“You? How did you get in?”

When she heard the voice, Wu You'er turned around abruptly. Her usual apathy vanished instantly.

When she saw it was Su Nantian, she could not remain calm.

She stood up immediately, but her body was so weak that she swayed slightly.

Fortunately, she caught the bed rail and steadied herself. After regaining her balance, she urgently asked, “Why are you here?”

Perhaps too surprised, Wu You'er’s question made her eyes widen in disbelief.

Chapter 713: Rescue

“I came to rescue you.”

Su Nantian did not speak of anything else. He immediately told Wu You'er his purpose.

When he had first seen her back, Su Nantian thought she was thinner than before. But when she turned around, he saw clearly—Wu You'er had become unrecognizable! Her collarbones were prominent, and her shoulders were sharp, as if only a thin layer of skin remained.

Seeing this, Su Nantian could no longer stay calm. He had to take Wu You'er away immediately; otherwise, she would truly be in danger!

“Come with me.”

After thinking this through, Su Nantian acted quickly. He did not waste time but immediately reached for Wu You'er’s hand to leave.

“Can’t I go?”

Wu You'er looked at him in confusion, her eyes widening further. Her face showed surprise.

Her eyes were already large, but now that she had lost weight, they seemed even larger.

“Go?”

Wu You'er whispered the word and looked at Su Nantian in surprise.

“Yes, it’s too dangerous for you to stay here.”

Su Nantian nodded firmly and gave her the answer. Then he took a step forward, grasping Wu You'er’s wrist with his hand and preparing to take her away.

“No! I can’t leave!”

At this moment, Wu You'er firmly shook her head and refused Su Nantian’s offer. She quickly pulled her hand away.

Before Su Nantian could ask why, Wu You'er immediately explained: “My parents are not safe. I can’t leave here; otherwise, Wu Chuan will use my absence to harm them!”

Saying this, she shook her head again. She would not allow her parents to be harmed again.

Wu You'er continued, “If my parents are not safe, I won’t leave!”

She could not be so selfish as to abandon them.

“You and…”

When Su Nantian heard this, he was completely at a loss. But seeing Wu You'er’s determined expression and her eyes, he could not continue speaking.

“Do you know where your parents are?”

There was no other choice but to comply with Wu You'er’s request. He could not ignore her plight.

He had no choice but to first go rescue her parents. Otherwise, Wu You'er’s condition would only worsen.

“I don’t know. I’m sorry…”

Wu You'er shook her head, looking sad and biting her lower lip. Her expression turned melancholic.

“Wu Chuan has always used my parents to threaten me. He would never reveal his cards. I don’t know where he has hidden my parents!”

Wu You'er continued, her voice growing lower with each word. Her expression became more sorrowful, making her appear pitiable.

“Think again.”

After hearing Wu You'er’s words, Su Nantian fell silent. After a moment, he asked again: “If you have no clues at all, I won’t be able to find them.”

Su Nantian was honest with Wu You'er. After all, the logistics team had spent half a year without finding Wu Tao’s location. How could he?

This delay was like searching for a needle in an ocean, with high difficulty and risk. This made Su Nantian even more worried about Wu You'er. He didn’t know how long her body could endure.

Earlier, he had heard from Lv Li that Wu You'er’s condition was improving and she had started eating. But now, seeing her withered form, he realized those words were empty talk.

How could she be improving? She looked so thin and weak!

After thinking this through, Su Nantian’s expression darkened further.

“I…”

Wu You'er clearly understood Su Nantian’s meaning, but thinking of her parents being tortured and imprisoned, she could not stay calm.

Torture.

The word made Wu You'er’s mind flash with a familiar image. She remembered!

When Li’s assistant had threatened her before, he had taken live videos of her parents. Wu You'er remembered the background was similar to the Wu Family’s structure.

“My parents are definitely imprisoned in the Wu Family!”

After recalling this important clue, Wu You'er quickly told Su Nantian. Her eyes shone with a strange light, and she seemed to regain her vitality.

“They must be there!”

Before Su Nantian could respond, Wu You'er added confidently.

“Any other clues?”

Since he had agreed to help her find her parents, Su Nantian naturally wanted to do his best. He would not fight without a plan. Therefore, he needed to collect as many clues as possible to make the search more efficient.

“I…”

Wu You'er showed a troubled expression again, then struggled to recall the scene she had seen. Unfortunately, she had been too preoccupied with sadness at that time and hadn’t noticed much.

Now, Wu You'er could only recall some vague fragments. She recalled the scene while telling Su Nantian: “It was very dark, and there were clear sounds of water droplets…”

Wu You'er furrowed her brows, struggling to think: “No! I can’t remember the details. I don’t recall clearly!”

Wu You'er tapped her head and bit her lip, looking frustrated and resentful. She seemed to blame herself for not remembering clearly.

“Very dark, and there were sounds of water?”

Su Nantian repeated the words softly. He quickly started thinking about where this place might be in the Wu Family.

“Yes! But I can’t remember anything else. I’m sorry…”

Wu You'er nodded firmly, giving Su Nantian the answer. But thinking of only remembering this little bit, she felt very sad.

If only she had known more, she could have found her parents faster!

It was all because of her uselessness…

The more Wu You'er thought about this, the sadder she felt. She felt useless and guilty for relying on Su Nantian to rescue her parents instead of doing it herself.

If only she had the strength, she wouldn’t need to be threatened by Wu Chuan or watch her parents suffer.

Chapter 714: Searching for People

“Knock knock—”

As Su Nantian was thinking, a loud knocking sound came from outside. The knock was urgent and clear.

“Hey! Inside! It’s just a meal, why is it taking so long?”

A moment later, the security guard outside impatiently urged.

“Coming!”

Su Nantian quickly responded. He knew he had taken too long this time, and if he didn’t go out soon, the security guards would suspect.

So Su Nantian gave Wu You'er a reassuring glance and quickly said, “Stay here. I’ll go find your parents. No matter what Wu Chuan asks, you must agree to it; don’t provoke him.”

If he provoked Wu Chuan, who would suffer? It would be Wu You'er herself.

That was why Su Nantian had repeatedly warned her to pretend to comply with Wu Chuan.

After saying this, Su Nantian looked at Wu You'er seriously: “But you must promise me that even if I can’t find your parents, you’ll leave with me first! We’ll plan from there!”

This place was not suitable for her to stay. Su Nantian could not allow Wu You'er to remain here alone.

After saying this, he did not wait for her response and immediately walked out.

As soon as he pushed the door open, his expression was already composed, and he wore a very casual demeanor. It seemed as if nothing had happened inside, leaving the security guards none the wiser.

“Just a meal! Why are you so slow?”

When Su Nantian came out, one of the security guards immediately complained, feeling that Su Nantian had wasted their time.

Su Nantian did not argue or quarrel with them but smiled and apologized: “Sorry, sorry. I was just told to watch Wu You'er eat personally.”

Su Nantian apologized and took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, handing them one by one to the security guards. He called them “brothers” and did everything perfectly: “Next time I’ll be more careful not to trouble you. This time, I’m really sorry!”

The other security guards accepted the cigarettes and saw Su Nantian’s good attitude. Their anger disappeared almost completely, only saying a few harsh but polite words before waving him off.

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian’s smile widened and he thanked them sincerely. He said a few casual words before leaving.

As soon as he turned around, his sycophantic expression disappeared instantly and was replaced with an imposing and authoritative one.

Su Nantian quickened his pace and returned to the rock garden where he had knocked out the guard.

He took off the uniform from the unconscious guard and threw it aside, then changed back into his own clothes.

Then Su Nantian continued to think about the place Wu You'er had mentioned—where it was dark and he could clearly hear water sounds.

“Where is it?”

Su Nantian stood still, thinking but with no clues. Although he had come to the Wu Family several times with Nan Gong Ping, he had always followed behind him and never explored the Wu Family.

Therefore, he was not familiar with its structure. The logistics team also had no accurate map of the Wu Family due to its strict security system.

This was not a good sign! Would he have come here in vain and failed?

With this thought, Su Nantian felt even more reluctant. His expression became serious.

Suddenly, as he was struggling, Su Nantian’s gaze fell on the unconscious guard. A thought immediately flashed into his mind.

An outsider wouldn’t know, but this guard who was already in the Wu Family might have some clues.

With this thought, Su Nantian immediately grabbed the guard’s nose with his finger and painfully woke him up.

The guard grimaced in pain and slowly regained consciousness.

At first, he was confused and only groaned while touching his nose. Then he instinctively touched his head.

Feeling the wound, the guard let out a hiss of pain, which was quite comical.

A moment later, he noticed Su Nantian standing before him and immediately wanted to shout. But when he felt the hard object pressed against his waist, he quickly complied and stayed silent.

This was a weapon Su Nantian had taken from the guard. He pointed it at the guard’s waist and coldly said, “If you don’t want to die, cooperate with me.”

After saying this, he continued: “I’ll ask you a few questions. Don’t speak unless I tell you to, or else the gun might fire accidentally. Got it?”

The guard looked at him with wide eyes, clearly frightened. He just stared blankly at Su Nantian.

“Understood? Nod.”

Not receiving a response, Su Nantian frowned and urged impatiently. He pressed the gun slightly deeper into the guard’s waist.

The coldness of the object through his clothes immediately made the guard清醒, and he nodded quickly. His eyes showed fear and unease.

Su Nantian had no time to explain or comfort the guard. He continued: “I ask you, where in the Wu Family is there a place that’s dark and has water sounds?”

“Ah?”

The guard was stunned, not expecting Su Nantian to ask this question.

“Quickly answer; don’t make me repeat it!”

Because of his concern for Wu You'er’s safety and the fear of wasting time, Su Nantian’s tone became more impatient. His face even showed a hint of hostility.

He urged again, and his eyes looked more ruthless. The guard, seeing this gaze, instinctively shivered and felt a chill run down his spine.

“Oh! I know!”

Under Su Nantian’s urging and intimidation, the guard quickly thought it over. He was also frightened by Su Nantian’s gaze and kept shivering.

After about ten seconds, the guard exclaimed excitedly.

Chapter 715: Rain Listening Pavilion

But before he could speak, Su Nantian gave him a warning glance. He immediately lowered his voice.

“Big brother, it’s the Rain Listening Pavilion.”

The guard confidently said and then instinctively sighed in relief, as if he had escaped a disaster.

“Rain Listening Pavilion?”

After hearing this name, Su Nantian’s expression slightly softened. He asked again: “How did you confirm it?”

After saying this, he added a warning: “Short and to the point!”

He had no time to waste.

“Ah! I know.”

The guard nodded immediately and began to explain: “Master Wu Chuan likes the sound of rain, so he specially built a Rain Listening Pavilion in the Wu Family. He can come anytime to listen to the rain.”

The guard recalled carefully and told Su Nantian: “And this place is only for him. No one else is allowed to approach.”

That was why the guard remembered it so clearly.

“Hmph, likes rain sounds?”

After hearing the guard’s explanation, Su Nantian let out a cold laugh. But thinking about the guard’s last sentence—that no one was allowed to approach without Wu Chuan’s permission—this confirmed Wu Chuan’s cautious nature. Therefore, the Rain Listening Pavilion was highly likely where Wu Tao and his wife were held.

With this thought, Su Nantian’s tense expression finally eased slightly and he no longer felt so anxious.

“Tell me where the Rain Listening Pavilion is.”

Su Nantian continued to ask, and the guard, fearing Su Nantian’s threat and the gun pressed against his waist, dared not refuse.

The guard immediately answered Su Nantian: “It’s there. Follow this small path to the end, then turn left and you’ll see the Rain Listening Pavilion.”

After obtaining the accurate location of the Rain Listening Pavilion, Su Nantian’s expression became even more relaxed. His eyes also showed a hint of satisfaction.

“Good.”

Su Nantian spoke softly, his gaze carrying an enigmatic meaning toward the guard.

The guard was startled by his gaze and asked fearfully: “Big brother, are you going to kill me? I’ve told you everything I know!”

The guard asked while trembling constantly. He was so unlucky—why had he been assigned to deliver the night snack? Now he had encountered a demon!
