Xinyue Group's influence within and beyond the country is considerable. If this matter were to be exposed, it would inevitably become a major media sensation, effectively laying bare every aspect of my life before the public. This was certainly not what he had hoped for.

Moreover, he had originally intended to assist Yue Xiaoshan by investing in Xinyue Group. However, his aid was purely altruistic; he had no desire for anything in return.

Wu Han also regarded Su Nantian and Yue Xiaoshan with a complex gaze. As the person Yue Xiaoshan trusted most, he was acutely aware of Xinyue Group's significance to her. Yet Yue Xiaoshan now sought to relinquish her shares in Xinyue Group, which seemed utterly out of character for her.

Yue Xiaoshan was taken aback by Su Nantian's immediate refusal. Could it be that Su Nantian truly had no interest in personal gain? This deviated from her expectations.

"Ahem, everyone quiet. Actually, I am quite close friends with Director Yue in private. What he just said was merely a joke. Since Xinyue Company has this regulation, I shall take this opportunity to declare that I will transfer all my shares to Director Yue unconditionally."

Su Nantian spoke lightly, yet his words stirred immense reactions within everyone's hearts, including Yue Xiaoshan's.

She had never imagined that the shares she cherished so dearly would become a liability in Su Nantian's hands. Thinking of this, her brows furrowed.

Chapter 337: Exposure

Su Nantian noticed Yue Xiaoshan's discontent and quietly approached her, whispering, "Xiaoshan, are you trying to kill me?"

Yue Xiaoshan said nothing but cast him a cold glance.

"Ahem, let's discuss this later. Alright? In any case, I absolutely cannot appear in the public eye; otherwise, it would bring unnecessary trouble to you. Do you understand my meaning?"

Su Nantian spoke seriously.

After hearing Su Nantian's explanation, Yue Xiaoshan fell silent. She was not the type to overcomplicate matters, and she understood that Su Nantian was no ordinary person. Since he refused to accept the shares, it was actually what she wished for.

After all, Su Nantian was a complete business novice. If he were to take over Xinyue Group, it would surely plunge the company into chaos within days.

Yue Xiaoshan eventually relented and made a concession: "Alright, I'll reclaim ten point five percent of the shares. You keep zero point five percent. I still hold absolute control, and you'll have to bear the title of a minor shareholder."

Su Nantian had contributed five hundred million yuan to Xinyue Group, and no matter how Yue Xiaoshan persuaded him, he refused to return the sum. Thus, she could only let him reluctantly accept a half percent stake.

Five hundred million yuan for half a percent of shares—this was an act deemed extremely absurd by anyone's standards. Su Nantian remained utterly calm throughout, his sole demand being to quietly stay by Yue Xiaoshan's side and reside within Xinyue Group.

However, Su Nantian was unaware that his decision to avoid public attention by transferring shares to Yue Xiaoshan had instead drawn media scrutiny. His seemingly foolish act was seized upon by the press, and his worst fear materialized.

"Xinyue's Mysterious Saviour Appears at the Celebration Banquet. Five Hundred Million Discarded So Easily—Who Is This Man?"

"Xinyue's President Position Changes Continuously. The New President Held Office for Just a Minute? Yue Xiaoshan Reclaims Power!"

"Explosive News! The Man Who Saved Xinyue Prefers a Woman Over the Company!"

The tabloid journalists fully embraced their role as headline writers. Since Xinyue Group was a major company influencing Jiangcheng's economy, this upheaval drew immense public attention.

As expected, Su Nantian became an instant sensation. Journalists rushed to capture his photos, even including him in casual moments like eating barbecue.

Within a high-end club on the outskirts of Jiangcheng:

"Damn it!"

The leader of the bankrupt Japanese assassin organization, Kudo Goushiro, hurled the newspaper to the ground. He stared with hatred at the smiling face on the paper—yes, it was Su Nantian, the so-called "rich man" now heavily publicized by the media.

Su Nantian himself was unaware that his initial intention to avoid drawing attention had instead led to exposure due to excessive modesty.

"Indeed, it's him."

Yue Lin gazed at the familiar face on the newspaper and muttered to himself. He had not expected this unassuming youth to repeatedly thwart his plans, not only overpowering him in combat but also possessing staggering wealth. Why was such a formidable figure present by Yue Xiaoshan's side? This puzzled him greatly.

He did not know that Yue Xiaoshan and Su Nantian's meeting was due to the pressure placed on Xinyue Group. Otherwise, Yue Han would have sought help from the Dragon Squad, and Old Du would have sent Su Nantian. If he knew the truth, what would his reaction be?

"Mr. Yue, do you recognize this man?" Kudo Goushiro asked, observing Yue Lin's expression as if he had just eaten something distasteful.

"Yes, Mr. Kudo."

Yue Lin took a deep breath and suppressed his anger, recounting all their previous encounters with Su Nantian in detail. His words were fervent and filled with hatred, as if he wished to tear Su Nantian apart.

"Ah, I see."

As the leader of an assassin organization, Kudo Goushiro was no fool. After his initial outburst, he quickly regained composure and listened carefully to Yue Lin's account before contemplating a solution.

After all, the funds he had used to target Xinyue Group's stock were not solely his own but the organization's liquid assets. He was only responsible for daily oversight and could not misuse them.

If this matter were exposed, the first to turn on him would be the organization's senior assassins. Internal divisions existed within the group, with many eyeing his position.

If he were caught with a flaw and used as an excuse, he might be torn apart by his own people within a short time. Therefore, he had to swiftly replenish the financial gap.

"A formidable opponent like him is indeed difficult to handle," Kudo Goushiro mused, ultimately giving Su Nantian a high evaluation. Yue Lin's brows furrowed—did this Japanese man intend to give up? However, Kudo Goushiro's next words immediately eased his concerns.

Taking a graceful sip of wine from the glass, Kudo Goushiro declared confidently: "Mr. Yue, while that man Su Nantian may be difficult to deal with in your eyes, he is merely an ant to us skilled assassins. We can crush him at will."

With that, he stood up and swiftly issued orders: "Mr. Yue, rest assured. We will dispatch our most elite assassins to eliminate him and your niece. At that time, you can take control of Xinyue Group and firmly grasp the entire company."

"Yes, thank you, Mr. Kudo," Yue Lin said with a smile and quickly filled their glasses before toasting respectfully.

He certainly had confidence in the assassins trained by the Japanese organization. Otherwise, he would not have sought their cooperation to divide the assets originally belonging to Yue Han and his daughter.

Even if they split the profits fifty-fifty, he considered it a profitable deal. With such a powerful ally, he dared to openly attack Xinyue Group.

Meanwhile, in the Yue family mansion, Su Nantian slumped on the sofa, staring at several newspapers and feeling equally troubled.

His initial plan was to remain low-key and help Xinyue through this crisis. He had even no intention of mentioning it to Yue Xiaoshan. It was only after she accidentally discovered the receipts and black cards that she realized the five hundred million had come from him.

Chapter 338: Voluntary Submission

The subsequent events completely exceeded his expectations. The back-and-forth of Xinyue's shares had thrust him into the spotlight, and with media coverage intensifying, it was unlikely he could remain low-key.

Worse still, before coming here, Old Du had given clear instructions to protect them discreetly. Now everything was exposed—how could it not be noticeable?

Fortunately, Su Nantian was resourceful. He did not provoke trouble but also did not fear it; he had enough confidence and ability.

There was no choice but to embrace the spotlight. Given Xinyue Group's current state, countless eyes were watching from the shadows. By his presence, he could at least deter many people's sinister thoughts.

The following days saw Yue Xiaoshan running around, negotiating and meeting with others to stabilize the current situation.

Su Nantian himself was not idle. As he knew nothing about business, he had to find other ways—like recruiting more underlings to assist him instead of doing everything himself.

To his surprise, the first person who voluntarily submitted to him was none other than Lanbanhu, a notorious gangster in Jiangcheng.

To be honest, Lanbanhu had been terrified of Su Nantian to the bone, avoiding him whenever possible. However, after Su Nantian's identity was exposed in the newspapers, this man no longer feared him. His mind was sharp and he understood that by supporting Su Nantian, his territory could rapidly expand.

After making up his mind, he decided to immediately approach Su Nantian and express loyalty.

"Ah, this is it!"

Recalling this, Lanbanhu rummaged through his home to find a decent outfit—something that would leave a good impression on Su Nantian.

After over ten minutes of effort, he finally tidied himself up. Wearing a wrinkled gray casual suit and a slightly yellowed white shirt, he looked completely different from his previous street thug image.

"Go on."

Lanbanhu was very satisfied with this outfit. He hurriedly stepped out, heading straight for Xinyue Group's office building. It was still early, so he planned to wait patiently in the reception area for Su Nantian to finish work.

In Xinyue Group's largest conference room, Su Nantian watched as Yue Xiaoshan and others continued their meeting. He thought it would take another two hours, so he decided to go for a walk to clear his mind. Being cooped up in the office was too stifling.

He took the elevator to the first floor and chatted briefly with a few security guards. They were familiar faces, and their relationship was quite good.

Moreover, everyone in the company now knew he was the savior who had saved Xinyue. With his vast wealth and no airs, it was beneficial to build relationships with him regardless of the reason.

After a few minutes, Su Nantian continued walking outside. As he was about to step out of the building, his peripheral vision caught a familiar figure sitting in the lounge area, smoking and looking quite at ease.

"Hey, isn't that Lanbanhu?"

Su Nantian had met Lanbanhu twice before and was familiar with his appearance. However, he was a bit uncertain now.

Previously, Lanbanhu always wore a colorful shirt with black leather jacket—clearly a street thug. Now, he was dressed in a tailored suit with a white shirt and had even styled his hair so neatly that no flies could land on it. He looked like a high-level executive, completely different from before.

"Maybe it's one of Lanbanhu's relatives. Well, I'll just go check."

Su Nantian had nothing else to do, so he slowed his pace and walked over casually. Raising his voice: "Hey, isn't that Lanbanhu?"

"Poof."

Lanbanhu had just finished smoking a cigarette and was lounging on the sofa, savoring it. Upon hearing someone call him, he quickly exhaled the smoke and looked up to see who had called him. It was Su Nantian.

He immediately stood up and bowed respectfully: "Little... no, not little. Master Su."

Lanbanhu was older than Su Nantian, but he instinctively wanted to call him "little brother" before swallowing it back.

There was no choice but to submit and acknowledge Su Nantian as his elder. It was only proper to lower one's head and be humble.

"Master Lanbanhu, why so formal?"

Su Nantian didn't understand Lanbanhu's intentions and walked over to sit across from him. He frowned and asked: "Are you looking for me?"

"Yes, yes."

Lanbanhu nodded repeatedly. He flattered: "Who in Jiangcheng doesn't know Master Su's name? Five hundred million thrown away so easily, just to win a woman's heart. Truly admirable."

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian waved his hand impatiently: "Don't mention it. I'm already troubled enough."

Seeing Su Nantian's expression, Lanbanhu wished he could hit himself. Clearly, his flattery had backfired.

He quickly tried to recover: "No, Master Su, what I mean is..."

Before he could finish, Su Nantian interrupted: "Alright, Master Lanbanhu, let's not waste time. Just tell me what you need. If I can listen, I will. If not, we'll part amicably. Don't keep pestering me, okay?"

"Alright, then I'll say it directly."

After Su Nantian had spoken so clearly, Lanbanhu gritted his teeth and answered solemnly: "I want to submit under your guidance, be your subordinate. If you agree, I'll be your subordinate."

"What? Did I hear that right?"

Lanbanhu's words had just finished, and Su Nantian raised an eyebrow. He looked at him with a half-smile: "Who are you? The renowned Tiger Brother on the streets. You come to say you want to be my subordinate? Are you mocking me?"

"Master Su, I'm telling the truth. If I lie, may heaven strike me down!"

Lanbanhu, seeing Su Nantian didn't believe him, swore to heaven and earth—almost burning incense and kowtowing to Guan Yu for proof.

"Alright, I believe you."

With his experience and insight, Su Nantian could clearly see that Lanbanhu was speaking the truth. He thought for a moment and understood Lanbanhu's hidden motives.

Before his identity was exposed, people who knew him considered him a capable and fearless bodyguard. Beyond that, he had no other merits.

Chapter 339: Tight Arrangements

But after the stock market incident at Xinyue Group, it caused a storm across the city. Now everyone in Jiangcheng knew he was a billionaire who didn't care about money, and some even speculated that he had secretly taken control of Xinyue Group.

For such a wealthy, powerful young man with outstanding abilities, it was natural for anyone to want to attach themselves. Thus, Lanbanhu's eagerness to approach and swear loyalty was understandable.

After a few minutes of consideration, Su Nantian felt that Lanbanhu's sincerity was beneficial. First, his identity had already been exposed; it was impossible to remain low-key. Now every move he made was under the watchful eyes of countless people, and even a slight movement could cause a storm.

Since low-key was no longer feasible, he might as well embrace the spotlight. He could raise a banner, recruit underlings, and expand territory to support Yue Xiaoshan and Xinyue Group from another angle. This approach was viable.

Additionally, Lanbanhu had dozens of underlings and controlled several streets' territories. Starting from scratch was unnecessary; Su Nantian only needed to support Lanbanhu.

Lanbanhu, sitting across from Su Nantian with an uncertain expression, felt quite anxious. After all, he had offended Su Nantian before. Though the result was that he had been beaten severely, if Su Nantian held a grudge and took revenge, it would be him who suffered.

With Su Nantian's current status, countless people in Jiangcheng wanted to rush forward and be his underlings. Adding one more was insignificant, but he couldn't guess Su Nantian's thoughts.

Fortunately, Su Nantian didn't keep him waiting long. After about five minutes, he looked up and asked softly: "Master Lanbanhu, I'll ask you one last time. Are you truly willing to be my subordinate? Do whatever I say, and never betray me?"

"Yes, of course."

Hearing this, Lanbanhu's face lit up with joy. Su Nantian's words were clear—this was likely to succeed.

He added: "By the way, Master Su, from now on you are my boss. You can call me Lanbanhu or Xiaomao; just don't call me Lanbanhu. It would be bad for reputation."

"Don't worry, you acknowledge me as your boss, but your age is much older than mine. You can bear the name Lanbanhu."

Su Nantian waved his hand dismissively: "I don't have many rules. If you do your job well, I definitely won't let you down. Including your subordinates, if I have a piece of meat, you'll get soup too. Do you understand my meaning?"

"Yes, yes."

Lanbanhu nodded rapidly. He hadn't expected Su Nantian to be so easygoing, without any airs or complicated rules.

If he had previously wanted to submit because of Su Nantian's status and power, now his mindset was gradually changing. He truly believed that Su Nantian was a qualified boss in terms of character and conduct.

Su Nantian then asked a few more questions, mainly to clarify the number of underlings Lanbanhu had and how much territory he controlled. Lanbanhu answered truthfully, detailing everything.

Moreover, he explained the division of territories among Jiangcheng's gangs, specifying which street belonged to which大哥 and who had good relations or conflicts with whom. This showed that he was indeed ambitious, unwilling to be just a street thug forever. Hence, he had voluntarily submitted to Su Nantian, hoping for an opportunity to rise and dominate Jiangcheng.

As he listened, Su Nantian occasionally offered suggestions. He told Lanbanhu which大哥 to befriend, from which direction to expand territory, and future two-year development plans. He had considered everything he could think of.

When it approached five o'clock in the afternoon, Su Nantian estimated that Yue Xiaoshan would soon finish her meeting. He instructed Lanbanhu: "Master Lanbanhu, I now assign you a task. You must do it with all your heart."

"Yes, Master Su, please speak."

Lanbanhu immediately sat up straight, ready to listen. This task was both a test from Su Nantian and an opportunity for him to demonstrate his abilities. No matter what, he had to do it well and not disappoint Su Nantian.

"Alright, I'll say it directly."

Su Nantian nodded slightly: "You already know the current state of Xinyue Group. It's facing internal and external challenges, teetering on the edge. Previously, both I and Director Tang were attacked by assassins several times. Fortunately, we were lucky each time and managed to escape unharmed."

"My biggest concern now is that the people hiding in the shadows might become desperate and attack Xinyue's senior management. Any loss of these individuals would be a blow to the company. Therefore, I hope you can have your underlings watch them closely. If anything happens, they should notify me promptly."

Su Nantian's idea was indeed necessary. Even if he could withstand attacks, he was just one person. He could protect Yue Xiaoshan as much as possible, but for the safety of Wu Han and others, he was stretched thin.

Previously, Wu Han had been framed and almost forced to quit. Now that the enemy had lost several hundred million in the stock market, if they were desperate and attacked people, all of Xinyue's senior management would face great danger. Strict precautions were necessary.

After hearing Su Nantian's task, Lanbanhu confidently patted his chest: "Master Su, no problem. This is what we're good at. Give me a list, and I'll definitely handle it."

Indeed, such tasks as surveillance were common for them. These street thugs didn't do legitimate work but had countless tricks up their sleeves. Su Nantian had found the right person.

"Alright, then it's settled. I'll send you the list tonight. You can have your underlings start working tomorrow."

Su Nantian said this, then realized something and emphasized: "Remember one thing. You can keep watch, but don't be too obvious. If they follow people everywhere, it might scare them into calling the police. Do you understand my meaning?"

Lanbanhu waved his hand confidently: "Don't worry, Master Su. My underlings are all top-tier talents; they won't make such a mistake."

Chapter 340: Interpersonal Skills

"Good then."

Su Nantian nodded and exchanged contact information with Lanbanhu. He also transferred one million yuan to him via his phone as a token of appreciation for the underlings.

As a veteran who had survived countless battles, Su Nantian naturally understood that to make the horse run well, one must feed it grass. People who worked hard for you sought fame and fortune. In this society, no one was a fool; only those who took advantage of the situation would do it. Feeding them well ensured they worked harder.

Lanbanhu tried to refuse, not wanting to accept the one million yuan: "No, Master Su. You're now the boss. I let my underlings work for you; we all do it willingly. Taking money would be inappropriate."

It wasn't that he didn't like money, but he understood the principle of not receiving rewards without effort. He had just submitted and acknowledged a boss, but he hadn't done anything yet. Giving him money felt awkward.

"Wouldn't your underlings need to eat and drink?"

Su Nantian rolled his eyes, unimpressed: "Take it. Let them work hard for you. In the future, there will be more rewards. I, as your older brother, definitely won't let you down."

"Then... thank you, Master Su."

After Su Nantian said this, Lanbanhu couldn't refuse the money and sincerely thanked him. He felt more convinced that he had chosen the right boss.

"Alright, let's go with this. I'm leaving."

Su Nantian stood up and greeted Lanbanhu, then walked towards the elevator. Lanbanhu respectfully escorted him: "Master Su, go slowly."

After Su Nantian had walked away, Lanbanhu looked at the message on his phone about the one million yuan deposit. He slapped himself hard and said: "Damn it, I knew this was a good opportunity. Fortunately, I seized it. This boss is truly worth it!"

After saying this, Lanbanhu pulled down his wrinkled gray suit and walked out confidently. He planned to return immediately and inform his underlings of this good news.

Of course, before that, he needed to go to the bank and withdraw fifty thousand yuan in cash. After all, money could move even ghosts; with a pile of bills thrown down, who wouldn't obey and do as told?

Su Nantian took the elevator directly to the upper floor. He first peeked into the conference room and saw that the meeting had ended. The room was empty, so Yue Xiaoshan must have returned to her office. He turned back and ran up to the top floor.

Half a minute later, the elevator stopped at the top. Su Nantian hurried out and stood at the entrance of the CEO's office, where two secretaries were waiting.

"Good afternoon, Mr. Su."

Since Su Nantian's identity had been exposed, it was no longer appropriate for him to be a bodyguard for Yue Xiaoshan. No one in the company dared to provoke him, so Yue Xiaoshan had hired two secretaries.

One was a tall and slim woman named Cheng Yuanyuan, Yue Xiaoshan's original secretary. They had worked together for a long time, and she was well aware of Yue Xiaoshan's habits. It was convenient to manage her.

The other was a round-faced girl with large black glasses named Han Nana. She had been sent by Yue Han to take care of Yue Xiaoshan.

There was no choice but to do so. During this period, Xinyue Group had been in turmoil with various incidents, and Yue Xiaoshan was exhausted.

Her father cared for his daughter and worried about her well-being in the company. He had sent a secretary to manage her daily life, showing how important Yue Xiaoshan was to him.

"Hello," Su Nantian nodded and responded. He didn't stop to chat but walked into the CEO's office.

Throughout, the two secretaries smiled and leaned forward slightly, keeping their posture low. They dared not show any disrespect.

Who could they offend? Su Nantian was both a god of wealth and the savior of Xinyue Group. Such a big boss wasn't someone they could afford to offend. Being humble and working diligently was definitely the right choice.

Bang.

Hearing the door open from outside, Yue Xiaoshan looked up from her magazine and asked: "Where did you go just now?"

Only a few people in the company had the right to enter her office. This direct entry without knocking was limited to one person, so she didn't need to look up to know it was Su Nantian.

Su Nantian casually sat beside Yue Xiaoshan and looked at her: "Nowhere special. I felt bored, so I went downstairs. Unexpectedly, I found a subordinate."

"Can you have subordinates? Who is so foolish?"

Hearing this, Yue Xiaoshan put down her magazine and looked surprised.

Su Nantian countered seriously: "What do you mean? It's their fortune to submit to me. By the way, you know him—Lanbanhu."

"Lanbanhu? Tiger Brother, that street thug?"

Yue Xiaoshan asked instinctively. She remembered that Lanbanhu had been beaten by Su Nantian several times before. How could he dare to approach and submit? Had that guy gone crazy?

"Yes, him."

Su Nantian explained seriously: "I understand your thoughts. But he's not crazy. That guy is shrewd. He wouldn't do anything without benefits. I plan to help him rise first and see if he can take over."

"Alright, you handle it yourself. I don't understand such things and can't give much advice."

Yue Xiaoshan nodded understandingly. Her strength was in handling business matters, while she knew nothing about street fights and backstabbing. She wouldn't pretend to know or give orders.

She definitely trusted Su Nantian, knowing he had his own ideas and would arrange everything properly.

"Rest assured, with me here, it's definitely safe."

Su Nantian was confident in recruiting a group of street thugs. It was simple—sweeten with rewards and use force when necessary. Those who cooperated would be rewarded, while those who didn't would be beaten.

After discussing the serious matters, Yue Xiaoshan turned her attention back to the magazine. She flipped to a page and spread it out, asking Su Nantian: "Hey, do you think this dress looks good on me?"

Su Nantian looked closely and saw it was a long black evening gown—elegant, dignified, with a touch of cold beauty. It was indeed suitable for Yue Xiaoshan's icy CEO image.

He was about to answer when his eyes unintentionally glanced upward, almost spilling blood.

Chapter 341: Attending the Banquet

Yue Xiaoshan's attire at work was usually a black business suit with a white shirt, giving her an image of sharpness and efficiency. Now she was holding the magazine with both hands, doing a chest-expanding movement. Her high breasts were stretched tightly by the shirt, and with her vigorous action, they seemed almost visible. Su Nantian even felt that the two buttons might be about to pop off.

Seeing this scene, he praised: "Hmm, good. Very good. Big and white..."

"Is that..."

Yue Xiaoshan was about to say "That's not bad, you have good eyes," but the two words that came out of Su Nantian's mouth sounded off. The dress was black, so where did the "big and white" come from?

"Ah! You bastard, where are you looking!"

Yue Xiaoshan reacted swiftly. She covered her chest with the magazine and grabbed a cushion from the sofa, throwing it at Su Nantian's head.

"I... I was looking at the magazine. You told me to look at this dress, right?"

Su Nantian blushed for the first time and muttered awkwardly. His explanation sounded extremely weak, and Yue Xiaoshan laughed coldly, not believing it at all.

There was no choice but to change the subject quickly: "Hey, boss, it's already half past five. Shouldn't we be leaving?"

Yue Xiaoshan raised an eyebrow and replied: "Alright, you go first. I have a banquet to attend tonight."

Hearing the schedule for today's evening, Su Nantian's head almost exploded: "No way, are you going to attend those boring business banquets again?"

After Xinyue Group's recent victory in the stock market, all of its stocks had surged. Now Xinyue Group was firmly at the top of Jiangcheng's business circle, and no one dared to underestimate Yue Xiaoshan's strength. Almost every day, she received invitations to various banquets.

As Su Nantian's bodyguard, he had to accompany her wherever she went. However, he truly disliked those superficial and polite gatherings. Each time he attended, he would hide in a corner and eat and drink freely.

If it weren't for his identity being exposed, making him a "rich man" known throughout Jiangcheng, he would have already been blacklisted by five-star hotels. This showed that money was still omnipotent in certain aspects.

"I don't want to go either, but this banquet is special. I can't miss it."

Yue Xiaoshan shrugged helplessly: "Tonight's banquet is hosted by the Jiangcheng Investment Promotion Association. Attendees include local business elders and elites, as well as many foreign friends. To strengthen the company and go international, it's essential to network with foreigners. Not attending would be a waste."

"Alright, when does the banquet start?"

Yue Xiaoshan had already arranged her schedule. "At eight o'clock tonight."

She had planned everything: it would take about forty minutes to get from here to the hotel, and with traffic during peak hours, it would take about an hour. They would go to the beauty salon to change clothes and then head directly to the hotel, ensuring they wouldn't be late.

Yue Xiaoshan's arrangements were thorough. Su Nantian naturally had no objections: "No problem, I'll follow your lead."

At that moment, a knock on the door came from outside. Secretary Han Nana reminded: "Director Tang, it's about time to go down."

"Yes, okay."

Yue Xiaoshan responded and packed her belongings into a small bag, slinging it over her shoulder before leaving the office with Su Nantian.

Then Han Nana led them to a lounge on the lower floor. There were various evening gowns and accessories available for selection, with makeup artists already waiting patiently.

Yue Xiaoshan and Su Nantian had attended numerous banquets recently, so the staff were well-versed in what to do.

They only took half an hour to dress and style their hair, standing together looking perfectly matched—truly enviable.

"Let's go."

Yue Xiaoshan smiled sweetly at Su Nantian. They默契ly held hands and took the elevator to the underground parking lot. The driver had already driven the car to the elevator entrance, making it convenient for them to get in.

In daily life, Su Nantian had been the one driving Yue Xiaoshan. However, since they both needed to attend the banquet, it was inappropriate for someone dressed formally to drive. Thus, Su Nantian could also take a small advantage and finally not have to drive himself.

An hour later, the driver parked the car smoothly in front of Ziju Hotel. As a five-star hotel, the entrance naturally had doormen to open the door and park the car. The service was very attentive.

Su Nantian and Yue Xiaoshan still held hands as they were about to step in. Dozens of reporters waiting outside immediately raised their cameras and took photos of them, as they were the two most prominent figures in Jiangcheng recently. Not taking a few more photos would be unprofessional.

"Alright, everyone stop. Please make way."

Fortunately, the bodyguards behind them acted swiftly, quickly separating the surrounding reporters to clear a path for Su Nantian and Yue Xiaoshan to pass smoothly.

"Wait, something's wrong. This is the smell of blood!"

As Su Nantian was about to protect Yue Xiaoshan and enter the hotel, his nose twitched slightly. His expression changed, sensing something was wrong.

Having experienced countless battles and near-death situations, he was no stranger to the scent of blood. In fact, he could even tell this fresh and heavy scent of blood—the injured person had bled a lot, still bleeding continuously.

So the question was: among those present, besides their own bodyguards, there were only the enthusiastic reporters and hotel security staff.
