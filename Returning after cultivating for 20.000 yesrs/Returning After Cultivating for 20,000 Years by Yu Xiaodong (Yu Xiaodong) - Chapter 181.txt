“Let me tell you! None of you will leave today! Unless you can step over my corpse!”

The leader spoke again, his voice cold, unaware that their words had become a prophecy—whether the first half or the second would come to pass.

As they spoke, their formation was complete, and heavy clouds had already been summoned, spreading across the entire sky.

In every direction they could see, it was a dark expanse. This weather alone could depress the heart, and now that they had created it, a sense of unease deepened within them.

Xiao Chen and his group broke out into cold sweat, but Su Nantian remained unmoved, his expression unchanged as if he had not seen the dark clouds above.

“Hmph. You just keep pretending. How long will you maintain this act?”

The leader had intended to intimidate Su Nantian, but was surprised that the latter remained so composed, showing no fear at all.

After this realization, their gazes toward Su Nantian grew even more hostile, as if they wished to strangle him on the spot.

Yet they reasoned that once their ultimate technique was unleashed, Su Nantian would have no chance or ability to resist.

Why then bother quarreling with a man already doomed?

After this thought, the leader consoled himself, calming his previous resentment.

At that moment, the clouds gathered completely, and soon lightning began to crackle through them, thunder clapping so violently that the space itself seemed terrifying.

When the leader saw this lightning, he wore a satisfied smile. This was their ultimate technique, one they had practiced for a long time—only true cultivators could summon such thunder.

“Even this method exists?”

After witnessing the scene, Su Nantian felt no fear but instead pondered how these people had achieved it.

Why could they summon lightning? And who were these so-called cultivators, and why did they call themselves that? As he thought this, Su Nantian’s mind gradually turned to investigating the true nature of these cultivators.

“Let this be a lesson in our strength!”

The leader sneered, his gaze toward Su Nantian filled with pride.

After speaking these words, he extended his hand forward, pointing directly at Su Nantian.

As the gesture was made, the lightning surged violently toward Su Nantian.

Chapter 904: Defying a Powerful Attack

“Senior Tian! Be careful!”

Xiao Chen and his group cried out in unison, their concern for Su Nantian evident.

This was lightning, not an ordinary weapon or tool—being struck would surely reduce one to ash!

How could a common person resist such natural power?

It was impossible.

“Senior Tian!”

Chen Xiaoling and the others cried out in unison, their faces filled with fear.

At that moment, when all assumed Su Nantian could not resist, a miracle occurred—no, rather, an astonishing event.

Su Nantian simply raised his hand and blocked the lightning that flew toward him, as if it had halted mid-air, unable to approach him at all.

“Zizizi—”

The lightning hovered above Su Nantian’s head, emitting a grating sound.

While most would show fear at being struck by lightning, Su Nantian remained calm, his expression serene and fearless.

“Damn it! How is this possible!”

The leader cursed, his entire body erupting in fury.

They had never before failed, yet Su Nantian possessed the ability to stop lightning.

This left the leader and his group stunned, their anger rising as if they had been tricked by Su Nantian.

After blocking the lightning, Su Nantian exhaled slightly.

He had merely intended to test his limits—since he could block bullets, was it possible to stop lightning as well? This thought had driven him to attempt it. To his surprise, he had succeeded in stopping the lightning itself.

Thankfully.

Su Nantian did not fear death, but he could not die here yet—he had not arranged a safe path for Xiao Chen and the others. How could he retreat?

Once that moment passed, Su Nantian would no longer fear them.

“Damn it! Hurry up! Everyone, attack again!”

Seeing Su Nantian relax, the leader grew even more furious: “Don’t be too pleased! This is only the beginning! What follows will be the real challenge!”

They issued further commands, and this time it was not one lightning bolt but all of them attacking together. Countless bolts crackled toward Su Nantian, a deluge of thunder.

“Just one bolt you could block, but how will you handle so many?”

The leader shouted, his expression increasingly triumphant, as if he already saw Su Nantian reduced to ash.

“Block it! Go on, block it!”

The leader mocked again, his arrogance unshakable. He had no doubt Su Nantian could stop these thunderbolts.

After all, they had never seen anyone with such ability.

With this mindset, the leader and his group unleashed their lightning.

The clouds had darkened the entire sky, turning day into night. As the lightning arrived, it illuminated the space completely.

Yet this light was not one anyone desired—it filled them with dread, sending chills down their spines.

Xiao Chen and the others had been deeply worried about Su Nantian, but after seeing him block the first lightning bolt, they too exhaled in relief. Their hearts, once raised high, now gradually settled.

But before they could fully relax, the black-cloaked men attacked again, and this time it was a coordinated assault. The number of lightning bolts had multiplied significantly.

The lightning now crackled toward Su Nantian like a swarm of silver serpents, their fangs bared.

If the first bolt had been a侥幸 (luck), this was now an impossible feat. How could Su Nantian possibly resist?

Xiao Chen and the others were so terrified they could not utter a word, even to warn Su Nantian.

Chen Xiaoling even covered her eyes with her hands, unwilling to witness the terrifying scene. Yet their hearts were filled with prayers—may Su Nantian be blessed, may he escape this trial and avoid being struck by the lightning.

“Good heavens!”

At that moment, one of the black-cloaked men let out a startled cry. This cry carried shock and fear, mixed with bewilderment.

“How… how is this possible!”

Even the attackers themselves stared in disbelief, unable to accept what they saw.

Was this man even human?

It seemed Su Nantian’s actions were no longer those of a mortal.

They had witnessed him block countless lightning bolts, each one hovering mid-air, crackling with a sound that chilled the bones.

Su Nantian’s face remained devoid of fear, his gaze fixed on the leader with an expressionless stare. His actions now seemed to lift the very sky itself.

At this moment, Su Nantian raised his hands, and the barrier he had formed seemed to freeze all the lightning, suspending them precisely above his head.

The position of the lightning was perilous—only a slight miscalculation would have seen them strike Su Nantian. In other words, it was only through his relentless effort that these bolts had not fallen upon him.

This situation was extremely dangerous, and few could have achieved it.

Yet Su Nantian had done so. The lightning, like writhing serpents, danced above him, yet not a single bolt had harmed him.

“How is this possible? These are countless thunderbolts! If he could block them, then he is no longer a common man!”

After this thought, the leader’s face darkened further. He repeated his question: “Tell me—what cultivation level are you at?”

What kind of cultivation could grant such an extraordinary ability?

One bolt might have been luck, but now countless lightning bolts—this was truly supernatural!

The black-cloaked men recalled their master.

Yet they had never known the extent of their master’s power, so they could not determine whether his current strength matched Su Nantian’s.

“Fools, this is no time for hesitation!”

As these thoughts surfaced in the leader’s mind, he shook his head to dispel his doubts. He glared at Su Nantian with a mix of anger and resentment, clenching his fists.

Chapter 905: A Grand Gift

He could not allow Su Nantian to control his emotions or instill fear in him. If this continued, he would indeed lose heart.

After all, among cultivators, there were those who used intimidation to crush their opponents. If they were subdued by Su Nantian’s pressure, they would be like warriors with their scapulae bound—unable to move at all.

Thus, the immediate priority was to swiftly eliminate Su Nantian and prevent him from lingering before them.

After this realization, the leader immediately ordered his distracted men to regain focus and attack Su Nantian again.

“Hurry! All of you, wake up! Don’t be dazed!”

The leader shouted loudly, rousing the distracted black-cloaked men.

“Attack together! This man’s abilities are unfathomable. If we do not eliminate him now, he will become a major problem in the future!”

The leader continued issuing commands, his words not mere lies but genuine concerns.

Moreover, he was genuinely afraid of Su Nantian, fearing the latter might have more tricks up his sleeve.

Thus, the leader’s gaze never left Su Nantian, wary of any sudden attack.

“Yes, boss!”

Hearing the leader’s words, the others responded immediately, nodding in agreement. They also kept a wary eye on Su Nantian.

They all adopted postures ready to attack, determined not to let Su Nantian exploit any opening.

Yet these men could not help but feel a sense of unease, for they had just witnessed Su Nantian effortlessly control their lightning.

They themselves had not noticed it, but once fear took root in them, they could no longer control their emotions—let alone fight Su Nantian.

In terms of morale, they had already lost before the battle even began.

“Hmph.”

These black-cloaked men thought they had concealed their emotions well, but Su Nantian had already sensed their fear and instability.

They could no longer intimidate Su Nantian.

Moreover, after their combined attack, Su Nantian had nearly grasped their strength. He realized they were no match for him, so there was nothing to fear.

“What are you laughing at? Don’t think your luck will last forever! We haven’t even attacked yet!”

The leader, already uneasy due to Su Nantian’s unexpected abilities, grew even more agitated upon seeing his mocking laughter.

He could not fathom why Su Nantian had suddenly laughed, and this uncertainty made him even more nervous.

“Nothing.”

Su Nantian was in a good mood, answering briefly before casting a meaningful glance at the leader and his men.

Though they all wore stern faces, determined not to lose face before Su Nantian, their bodies instinctively tensed upon meeting his gaze. Their facial muscles tightened as if pulled by invisible threads.

“You have given me this gift, and now it is my turn to return one.”

Though Su Nantian did not know how they had summoned the lightning, now that he had control over it, to waste such a gift would be foolish.

He emphasized the word “gift” with deliberate intent, his gaze teasing and mocking.

These men should not be startled by what was to come—otherwise, it would lose its charm.

Su Nantian had already discovered the secret to controlling these lightning bolts and knew how to manipulate them.

Like with the bullets before, it was effortless—no extra effort required.

Su Nantian moved his fingers slightly, and the lightning above him responded as if attuned to his will.

These silver lights had already instilled fear and unease in people; now they heightened the black-cloaked men’s tension to its peak, leaving them all thoroughly unsettled.

“No! What are you planning? Don’t be reckless! Hey, do you hear me? Don’t think of being reckless!”

When the leader heard Su Nantian’s words, his heart skipped a beat. A terrible thought immediately surfaced, and an intense unease enveloped him.

The leader realized what Su Nantian intended to do and immediately spoke out, trying to stop his actions.

After all, Su Nantian could evade the lightning attacks, but they could not!

If struck, they would have no chance of survival.

This realization turned their faces green with fear, and they stared at Su Nantian in terror, their eyes fixed on him without blinking.

Unfortunately, Su Nantian would not heed them nor comply with their demands. Upon hearing their fearful and desperate words, his lips curled into a more pronounced smile.

“No! Don’t do this!”

“Don’t act like that!”

The black-cloaked men were now completely frantic. If they had previously been the ones setting the rules of the game, now their roles had reversed—they were the helpless lambs awaiting slaughter with no chance to fight back.

They cried out in fear, but their voices did not stop Su Nantian’s actions. Instead, they watched helplessly as he waved his hand and directed the dangerous lightning toward them.

Though countless bolts hovered above Su Nantian’s head, he effortlessly separated one and let it circle around him like an obedient child.

If it were any other time, they might have found this rare scene intriguing. But now, one mistake could mean their end.

They were so terrified that they had no interest in watching anymore.

At this moment, they all tensed up, their eyes fixed on Su Nantian.

Su Nantian smiled again, as if recalling an amusing scene, then spoke: “The game has begun. I shall now distribute the gifts.”

His tone was unusually playful, but to the black-cloaked men, no one could laugh.

Chapter 906: A Lesson

“Zilila—”

The lightning emitted a terrifying sound, its brilliance chilling.

Su Nantian manipulated these bolts with an amused and mocking gaze, as if he were not clashing with them but merely playing a game.

“Hmph.”

Su Nantian let out a cold laugh, and though it was merely a sneer, it seemed like the voice of a ghost from hell. The black-cloaked men were so terrified they could not meet his gaze.

“Go!”

Su Nantian was satisfied with his view and had achieved the fear he desired. If not, they would never realize how weak they truly were.

Moreover, Su Nantian seemed to be deliberately toying with them, issuing a warning that he had not directly struck them. Instead, he let the lightning explode before their feet.

“Pang—”

The lightning struck the ground in front of them with a thunderous sound.

The area where it had struck turned black and charred, emitting a strong scent of burning.

If this lightning had struck them directly, the damage would have been unimaginable.

These black-cloaked men had previously seemed confident but now gasped in fear, staring at Su Nantian with terror.

After all, he had blocked their lightning before—how could he now control it?

Even they had trained for a long time to summon these lightning bolts, but even then, they could not manipulate them as skillfully as Su Nantian.

They had never seen anyone with such ability—directly controlling lightning and even selecting one to attack them.

Moreover, Su Nantian’s actions suggested these bolts obeyed his will and could strike anywhere.

“Good heavens! Senior Tian is truly amazing!”

Xiao Chen and the others, watching from the sidelines, were transformed into starry-eyed admirers. They watched Su Nantian with awe and admiration.

Unlike the black-cloaked men, their reaction was fear and unease—believing Su Nantian to be extraordinary. But for Xiao Chen, the more powerful Su Nantian was, the better it was for their side.

Seeing the black-cloaked men cower before Su Nantian, they immediately cheered and shouted encouragement for him.

“Damn it! Are you crazy?”

At this moment, the leader snapped out of his daze and saw that his subordinates had been terrified by Su Nantian. He angrily confronted Su Nantian, his face filled with disbelief but still scolded him defiantly.

Now they were at a critical point—there was no turning back. If they did not eliminate Su Nantian, their fate would be sealed!

After this thought, the leader’s hand clenched tightly. He stared at Su Nantian with unease and fear in his heart.

“Crazy? These are not your gifts? Why do you think I am merely returning them to you now, and yet you cannot bear it?”

Su Nantian smiled, his expression deeply meaningful.

He now finally understood what it meant to wield power and dominance.

After this thought, he hooked his finger and gazed at the black-cloaked men with a mocking expression.

This was only the first one—true gifts were still to come.

After this, Su Nantian had no desire to waste words with them. Once they were terrified by his abilities, they would obey without question—no need for further words.

Su Nantian extended his finger, and it twitched slightly. The lightning above him followed suit, swaying with him.

Each bolt seemed to come alive in Su Nantian’s fingers, dancing and flickering like a silver serpent.

The sight was so terrifying it made one’s skin crawl, evoking deep fear at this horrifying image.

“Sss—”

The black-cloaked men gasped again, staring at Su Nantian in sheer terror.

“What should we do now, boss? This man is definitely not ordinary. Can we fight him?”

The black-cloaked men, now completely terrified by Su Nantian’s actions, turned to their leader for guidance. They sought his advice and hoped he would provide a way to deal with Su Nantian.

“He is too powerful, and his abilities far exceed those of ordinary people. We are no match for him.”

The black-cloaked men spoke with fear and panic, their hearts filled with dread.

At first, they had been delighted when assigned this task—expecting to find a child in this small fishing village. This mission had seemed effortless.

But they had not anticipated encountering a problem like Su Nantian.

The thought of his abilities surpassing all theirs and his attack methods being completely different filled them with uncertainty.

They had grown even more wary of Su Nantian, and now they were completely disoriented.

“Silence! What are you all so afraid of?”

The leader was also quite frightened, but he could not show it in front of them. Especially since he was their leader, he must remain composed.

Otherwise, Su Nantian would take advantage of the opportunity and continue to intimidate them—how could they fight back then?

“His power is just bluffing. Our ultimate technique has not been used yet—don’t be afraid!”

The leader now consoled the other black-cloaked men, but it was more for his own reassurance.

He thought that with so many of them attacking Su Nantian, they would not fear him.

But they had forgotten that Su Nantian had already intercepted their lightning and used it without needing to perform the complicated summoning process or hand signs.

Su Nantian simply needed to block their attacks and let them be his own.

Moreover, Su Nantian had even managed to separate a single bolt of lightning—something they themselves could not achieve.

Even the leader himself likely lacked this ability.

After thinking this through, the black-cloaked men became even more terrified. Their belief in the leader’s words was now weak, and few still trusted his lies.

The more they thought about it, the more frightened they became. They no longer wanted to look at the leader, for they knew his words were all lies and that they could no longer trust him.

Chapter 907: Gathering Courage

“What are you all staring at? Are you planning to accompany this scoundrel to his death?”

The leader had not expected Su Nantian to instill such fear in so many people. He felt a sense of fear toward Su Nantian, and if this continued, he would have no chance of victory.

After clarifying this, the leader immediately began forming hand signs again and prepared to attack Su Nantian: “Go! Follow me!”

He rushed toward Su Nantian while rallying the others to follow.

“I warn you, if you remain frozen now, you will only die. If you fight with me, there might still be a chance to survive!”

The leader now realized that merely comforting them would not work, so he changed his strategy and urged them to attack Su Nantian together.

Moreover, the leader deliberately acted swiftly and decisively to show his determination. Previously, they had all been demoralized and dared not fight back, even considering giving up and waiting quietly.

Now, after hearing the leader’s words, they quickly regained their senses. Their eyes widened, and they rushed toward Su Nantian immediately.

“The leader is right! If we do not fight back, we are doomed!”

One of the black-cloaked men spoke loudly, and others echoed his words.

They now understood that if they did not act against Su Nantian, it would be too late.

After this realization, they no longer hesitated but rushed forward to attack Su Nantian.

At this point, they even revealed their final survival techniques and attacked him from both sides, aiming for a decisive strike.

They would not allow Su Nantian to win!

“Hmph, come at me then.”

Su Nantian saw them gathering courage and preparing to attack him, so he let out a cold laugh.

He was not affected by them at all and showed no fear.

He did not fear their attacks but feared they would hesitate to strike.

This was exactly what Su Nantian wanted.

After this realization, he rushed toward them and met their attack head-on with swift determination.

“Senior Tian! Be careful!”

Xiao Chen and the others saw this situation and knew Su Nantian would have to face them. They quickly warned him from the side.

Chen Xiaoling and the others tightly gripped their hands, watching with concern and praying for Su Nantian’s safety.

Everyone was determined to kill the other, so they all used their most powerful techniques.

At this moment, the black-cloaked men also formed hand signs and rushed toward Su Nantian.

Their every move was fierce, as if this would defeat Su Nantian. One of them struck with a palm aimed at Su Nantian, as if to shatter his heart.

But before he could act, Su Nantian extended his hand and, as before, hooked his finger. The lightning responded like his subordinates, rushing toward this man.

This time, Su Nantian was not playing around—he knew the enemy meant to kill him. Thus, his attack was fierce and direct.

This bolt of lightning struck the man who had rushed toward him, piercing his heart instantly. The man shuddered and died on the spot.

The others were stunned by Su Nantian’s swift action, gasping in fear.

They had not expected him to act so directly without hesitation. After this thought, they became even more terrified and did not know what to do.

“Boss, the enemy is truly a tough nut. How should we deal with him?”

One of the black-cloaked men asked anxiously, seeking a solution from the leader.

“What are you afraid of? He is just one person! We have so many of us. I don’t believe he can keep dodging forever!”

The leader’s thoughts were genuine—he simply did not believe Su Nantian had such extraordinary abilities to be everywhere at once.

Thus, he charged toward Su Nantian with renewed determination. His palm was fierce and aimed to crush Su Nantian.

Su Nantian did not use lightning against him directly but skillfully dodged the attack.

As this man struck, a fierce wind swept past. When Su Nantian dodged it, the wind hit a rock behind him and split it in two. Imagine what would happen if this palm had struck Su Nantian directly!

The leader saw Su Nantian dodge his attack and his face turned dark, but he quickly clenched his fists and rushed toward Su Nantian again.

Others who wanted to attack Su Nantian saw the leader’s fierce assault and also did not hesitate but rushed toward Su Nantian, determined to fight him.

At this moment, it was a life-or-death struggle. If they delayed any longer, there would be no chance to regret it.

They all glanced at the corpse of their comrade, charred and blackened by Su Nantian’s lightning. They were terrified and swallowed hard—they did not want to become this blackened mess.

Thus, they could only attack together and strike Su Nantian.

Only by eliminating him would they have a chance to survive.

After this realization, their gazes toward Su Nantian grew fiercer and filled with murderous intent.

Su Nantian had already known their intentions were not pure, so he showed no fear upon seeing their murderous intent. Instead, he directly met them in combat.

Despite so many of them, they could not even harm Su Nantian a little. Instead, he had beaten each of them one by one, leaving them wounded and crying out in pain.

And now they dared not look at Su Nantian anymore.

Chapter 908: Confronting the Enemy

“Pup!”

Even the leader could not avoid Su Nantian’s attack, as his fist struck directly at his heart, causing him to spit out a large amount of blood.

“Boss!”

The other black-cloaked men, already terrified and worried that if the leader fell to Su Nantian’s hands, they would be leaderless and unable to fight him, now became even more anxious.

They surrounded the leader, asking about his condition with concern.

“Enough! Don’t crowd around me. Go attack him. I’m fine.”

The leader took a deep breath and pushed away those who held him, urging them to continue attacking Su Nantian. He also stood up again and straightened himself.

His gaze toward Su Nantian now carried a fiercer intent.

He felt that if it were not for Su Nantian’s attack, he would not have embarrassed himself in front of so many subordinates.

After all, he had never failed at any mission before. Yet this time, assigned to what he thought was an easy task, he had encountered Su Nantian—a tough opponent.

But the leader still did not fear him. He believed that after so many missions, this was merely Su Nantian. He would definitely deal with him.

Even if he could not defeat him, he would take him down with him and ensure he did not survive alone.

Seeing the leader stand up again, the others’ faces returned to normal, and they sighed in relief. As long as the leader was fine, it was okay.

Their worries receded, and their hearts, which had been in their throats, gradually settled.

When Su Nantian saw their expressions, he let out a cold laugh: “Have you all calmed down so quickly? I have not yet revealed my true strength.”

Su Nantian said this while mocking them, but he was telling the truth. He had not yet shown his abilities—until now, he had only been fighting them.

Even more astonishing was that while battling them, Su Nantian had not abandoned the lightning he controlled. It hovered around him like a ticking bomb.

Others saw this and dared not attack Su Nantian directly, fearing he might unleash the lightning on them.

“Hmph! How dare a foolish child speak so arrogantly!”

The leader, hearing Su Nantian’s words again, interrupted him and glared at him with a colder expression.

At the same time, he urged others: “All of you must be fully alert! Do not believe his lies. If he were truly so powerful, he would have already eliminated us instead of fighting with us like this!”

The leader let out a cold laugh: “I think he is just stalling for time and trying to scare us.”

The more the leader said this, the more he believed his own guess.

If not for that reason, why would Su Nantian not attack them directly but instead keep stalling?

Upon hearing the leader’s words, the other black-cloaked men immediately showed understanding.

It seemed they had been afraid for no reason, and the enemy was merely a mediocre level—no match for them.

After this thought, their fear of Su Nantian lessened by half and they no longer feared him as much.

Their morale seemed to recover, and their gazes toward Su Nantian grew more defiant, mixed with anger at being tricked.

“Good! So you were just bluffing all this time. Let’s see how we deal with you!”

One of the black-cloaked men coldly spoke to Su Nantian, feeling ashamed for having been afraid of him. He would kill Su Nantian and ensure this night’s events were not spread.
