The old man, upon hearing He Wei’s words, immediately widened his eyes, as if he had not anticipated such a lucrative opportunity falling into his hands.

He gazed at He Wei with surprise, saying: “You mean to buy all these cars? But I—”

At this point, the old man paused, then continued: “But I rely on renting these cars to earn a living. If you buy them all, what will I do then?”

In truth, the old man was already deeply tempted. The rental prices were low, and few people came here. If he could sell them off, it would be a substantial profit.

Not to mention, it would cover his burial expenses!

He Wei then said: “I will purchase them at the price of new vehicles. Afterward, you can buy more cars to rent out again. This deal won’t leave you at a disadvantage.”

At this point, He Wei clearly understood that the old man was hoping to squeeze more profit. So he interrupted him mid-sentence, continuing: “But human greed is like a snake swallowing an elephant. If you don’t know when to stop, you might not even recover the money for these minivans.”

As He Wei spoke, he gestured to his subordinates standing behind him. They nodded in understanding and casually fiddled with their guns.

“Sss—”

The old man’s eyes widened upon seeing the weapons, nearly popping out of his head.

“Hey! Hey!”

If he had immediately nodded and agreed to the deal, then said: “Sell, I’ll sell it.”

The old man was terrified, his heart pounding like a drum, and his legs trembling.

“Old man,” He Wei said, scanning the old man’s face to detect any signs of deceit. “Since you mentioned this small fishing village is so remote, we still need a guide. Let you lead us there. Don’t worry, after guiding us, we’ll give you some money. We won’t let you work for nothing.”

When He Wei said this, he scrutinized the old man, hoping to catch a glimpse of his true intentions.

But upon hearing this, the old man shook his head repeatedly in fear.

“Not advisable! Not advisable! I’m an old man, and if I endure this journey back, I might not survive!”

The old man was shrewd. Having lived so long, he had seen countless storms. Even in this remote town, he was far smarter than most.

Upon seeing they had guns and were openly searching for people here, he realized they were no ordinary group.

Moreover, the old man didn’t want to risk his life for a little money. He quickly declined.

Seeing He Wei’s expression was off, and sensing his anger, he spoke first: “I have a map here I can give you for free. Although this small fishing village is far, there’s only one mountain path leading in. If you follow it, you’ll definitely not get lost.”

“Nothing will go wrong. You can rest assured.”

At this point, the old man repeatedly reassured him, fearing He Wei might ignore his objections and forcibly take him in the car.

He thought of this concern, speaking while stepping back.

Chapter 929: Attack

“You can rest assured. It’s very remote, with only one path. There are no other directions; otherwise, it would be all mountains. You don’t need a guide.”

At this moment, the old man was also worried he couldn’t convince He Wei to stop forcing him to guide them. He feared angering them and suffering consequences, so he carefully responded.

Moreover, the old man looked at them sincerely, not daring to avoid their gaze.

Upon hearing this, He Wei furrowed his brows slightly, pondering for a moment before finally believing the old man.

He didn’t want to bring this burden in, and if something happened on the way, it would complicate matters. Besides, the old man was too aged; bringing him might scare him to death halfway.

After thinking this through, He Wei extended his hand toward the old man: “Give me the map.”

Upon hearing this, the old man sighed in relief, realizing he had escaped danger.

He hurriedly handed over the map and added: “Follow this path, and you’ll reach the small fishing village. There’s no mistake.”

The old man added this warning, fearing they might change their minds and come back to trouble him. He quickly conveyed these details.

After hearing this, He Wei’s group nodded in satisfaction, their eyes showing a bit of admiration for the old man. At least he was sensible.

Otherwise, when they finally asked him directly, the old man wouldn’t have had it so easy.

The old man understood this logic and quickly sent them off, treating them like a plague by putting them into the car.

“The fuel is already full. It’s enough for you to drive there and back. You can rest assured.”

The old man obediently took care of them, even preparing a bag of dried food for them to eat on the way.

Upon seeing the old man’s compliance, He Wei gave him a little extra money as thanks.

He Wei and his group hurriedly set out to the small fishing village to find Qin Wu and the child.

They didn’t know that as soon as they stepped out, a few figures emerged from the alley ahead. They were trembling and their legs shook.

Because upon seeing these people, they remembered the tragedy they had witnessed in the small fishing village that day.

These three were Xiao Chen, Chen Xiaoling, and the young man A Yu. They had been sent by Su Nan Tian to purchase daily necessities and food.

But no one expected that they would encounter these people so early in the morning. Upon seeing their actions, Xiao Chen and the others knew these people were not friendly.

Moreover, they saw them searching for someone named Qin Wu. They realized this person had already been killed by Su Nan Tian, so they knew these people were part of the same group.

At this moment, they were extremely nervous.

“What should we do? They’ve gone toward the small fishing village.”

A Yu asked anxiously, his face pale and lips white with fear.

“What should we do? We might not make it back in time!”

These people had taken minivans, while Xiao Chen and the others had walked all morning. They had hitchhiked with people along the way, so they didn’t have any proper transportation.

Even if they hurried back now, it might not be enough to warn Su Nan Tian.

Upon thinking this through, A Yu’s face turned grim.

Even if they couldn’t make it in time, they couldn’t just watch Su Nan Tian fall into danger.

These people clearly weren’t good guys. And when they had threatened the old man, Xiao Chen and the others had seen them carrying guns.

These people weren’t ordinary. If left unchecked, Su Nan Tian and Xiao Wang would be in trouble.

Xiao Chen and the other man were sweating profusely, wishing they had wings to fly back and help Su Nan Tian. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be so anxious now.

“Ah! What should we do? How can we inform Tian Ge?” Xiao Chen stamped his foot, full of worry. If they returned to the small fishing village now, it might not be timely enough. And if they were caught following them, they might be taken hostage to threaten Su Nan Tian. In that case, they would become a burden for Su Nan Tian.

This was what Xiao Chen and the others were most worried about.

Because of these concerns, they hesitated, unsure how to return and inform Su Nan Tian.

At that moment, the three of them were stuck, unsure what to do and couldn’t think of a perfect solution.

“Ah!” Xiao Chen sighed impatiently, as he was too anxious and started pulling at his hair. If he continued like this, he might become bald!

“I have an idea!” Chen Xiaoling suddenly thought of a plan. Her eyes lit up, shining with determination.

“What idea?” Xiao Chen and A Yu turned to her immediately upon hearing her voice, waiting for her words.

“It’s simple!” Chen Xiaoling said now that she had a plan. Her previous anxiety had faded, and her face regained some calmness.

But Chen Xiaoling also knew the situation was urgent. It wasn’t time to be cryptic, so she quickly explained her plan to Xiao Chen and A Yu.

“Brother! Do you remember? The village head’s house has a telephone!” Chen Xiaoling said, looking at Xiao Chen and A Yu. “We can’t move as fast as they drive, but we can call back first to warn Tian Ge. That way, he’ll be prepared!”

After saying this, Chen Xiaoling continued: “And after Tian Ge is warned, we can go back to help him. That’s how it should be!”

Chen Xiaoling said this and wore a relaxed expression, thinking they could help Su Nan Tian without making him unprepared for these people’s sudden appearance.

If he was warned beforehand, Chen Xiaoling believed Su Nan Tian would surely have a way to deal with these people.

Chen Xiaoling’s idea was excellent, and she had made up her mind to go back and help Su Nan Tian. She wouldn’t let this matter slide. They had to face it together with Su Nan Tian.

Chapter 930: Precautions

“Right! Right! You’re really clever, Xiao Ling!” Xiao Chen and the others nodded immediately, agreeing with Chen Xiaoling’s statement.

“You’re really smart. Unlike us who just panic!” They praised Chen Xiaoling, thinking if it weren’t for her idea, they would have been like ants on a hot pan with no solution.

After making up their minds, they quickly called the village head’s number.

Fortunately, people in San Shi Town were simple and kind. Borrowing a phone was very easy. They quickly connected to the village head’s house.

But the phone never rang.

“Ah! Tian Ge, please answer the phone!” Xiao Chen and the others were extremely anxious, repeatedly praying and muttering these two sentences while hoping Su Nan Tian would answer the phone.

At that moment, Su Nan Tian hadn’t noticed the phone. He had gone to the backyard to absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth while Xiao Wang was asleep.

After their last fight, Su Nan Tian had understood the term “cultivator” and this new kind of person. He also remembered their strange techniques. He had previously defeated them by utilizing the abundant spiritual energy here.

So Su Nan Tian was desperately absorbing this power, hoping to be more prepared when they arrived.

That’s why Su Nan Tian didn’t notice the phone ringing at the village head’s house.

He was unaware, but Xiao Chen and the others in San Shi Town were desperate.

“What should we do? Tian Ge isn’t answering!” After hanging up, Xiao Chen looked anxiously at Chen Xiaoling and A Yu, not knowing what to do.

At this critical moment, how could Tian Ge let them down? If they couldn’t connect, they didn’t know what to do!

“Call again,” Chen Xiaoling quickly patted their shoulders, calming them and suggesting: “Brothers, don’t panic. We still have time. Call again to inform Su Nan Tian!”

Chen Xiaoling said this again.

After all, these people would need some time to return. They could use this time to contact Su Nan Tian quickly.

Upon hearing this, Xiao Chen and the others slightly calmed down, no longer as anxious before. So they kept calling Su Nan Tian’s phone repeatedly; otherwise, giving up would put Su Nan Tian in trouble.

They were so worried that they kept calling again and again, hoping Su Nan Tian would answer quickly.

If it weren’t for no other choice, they really wanted to fly back with wings to find Su Nan Tian.

Fortunately, after meditating and adjusting his breath in the backyard, Su Nan Tian gradually noticed the commotion at the village head’s house.

Upon hearing this ringing sound, Su Nan Tian furrowed his brows slightly. Did someone contact the village head?

But upon thinking this, Su Nan Tian quickly answered the phone.

As soon as he picked up, Xiao Chen and the others sighed in relief: “Thank goodness! Tian Ge, you finally answered!”

The villagers of the small fishing village were all dead. Now only they had come out, so when the phone was answered, Xiao Chen and the others didn’t doubt it was anyone else.

They sighed in relief and said this, then quickly got to the point: “Tian Ge, now we tell you that a group of strange people are going to our small fishing village. Their target seems to be Xiao Wang, and I heard their words; they seem to know the people who troubled us before, those Qin Wu guys!”

Xiao Chen quickly told Su Nan Tian about what they had discovered without delay: “Tian Ge, you must be careful! They’ve already gone there!”

“Someone is coming?” Su Nan Tian furrowed his brows upon hearing this, as if he had found something amusing. His expression became very meaningful.

It was a coincidence; he had been thinking about these people not taking action, so he would go out to investigate. But they had taken the initiative and come to trouble him first.

“Right, Tian Ge, and they have guns. Everyone looks very unfriendly. You must be careful! They drove several minivans into the small fishing village!”

Su Nan Tian thought it was amusing that these people had come to him, giving him more fun. He didn’t know this matter was a disaster for Xiao Chen and the others, who were extremely anxious!

Xiao Chen quickly told Su Nan Tian, as he was too eager and sometimes couldn’t think clearly. But he didn’t have time to organize his thoughts, so he just told Su Nan Tian whatever came to mind.

“Okay, I know.”

Su Nan Tian heard their words and knew they were very anxious. He replied with a nod, telling them to rest assured.

“Tian Ge, you be careful. We’ll go back and help you.”

After saying this, Xiao Chen and Chen Xiaoling nodded and prepared to return to help Su Nan Tian.

“No.”

But at this moment, Su Nan Tian interrupted their actions.

“Tian Ge?” Xiao Chen and the others were stunned. They thought Su Nan Tian had something else to say, so they immediately asked into the phone: “What is it, Tian Ge? You said.”

“I mean you don’t need to come back. Stay in San Shi Town, it’s safer there.”

Su Nan Tian had considered this and told the three of them to stay temporarily.

“Impossible, Tian Ge! How can we leave you alone facing danger? These people definitely have other intentions. Tian Ge, wait for us; we’ll be back soon!”

Xiao Chen immediately shook his head in disagreement upon hearing Su Nan Tian’s words: “We definitely have to go back and help you.”

“Right, Tian Ge, don’t say anything more. We’re already on our way back now.”

Chen Xiaoling and the others also said this, hoping to persuade Su Nan Tian not to let them stay.

“I won’t. You all stay in San Shi Town. If you truly consider me your Tian Ge, listen to my instructions.”

Su Nan Tian said this again, interrupting their decision and saying: “You haven’t even started learning martial arts. Facing these people, you have no chance of resistance. If all three of you come back, I’ll just have three more people to protect.”

“Better for you to stay in San Shi Town and come back after this matter calms down.”

Chapter 931: Coping

At this point, Su Nan Tian said with certainty: “Listen to my instructions.”

“But Tian Ge, they are many people.”

Xiao Chen understood the logic behind Su Nan Tian’s words and knew he wasn’t嫌弃 them for being useless, but was worried about their safety. He didn’t want them to risk themselves.

But they couldn’t let Su Nan Tian face so much danger alone.

If these people were stronger than the last group, what would they do?

How could Su Nan Tian cope with them alone?

“Many people? I have my own way. Don’t worry about me.”

Su Nan Tian knew they were worried, so he interrupted them and said: “In any case, listen to me. Don’t come back. If anyone dares to return, I’ll take Xiao Wang and disappear, leaving you all unable to find me. You know I have the ability.”

Su Nan Tian now used this method to prevent them from returning.

“Tian Ge, you’re not playing fair!” Xiao Chen helplessly replied. They all knew Su Nan Tian had the ability to escape them all, and they also knew he could leave Xiao Wang behind if he wanted. They couldn’t find him.

But Su Nan Tian hadn’t left, still staying here.

They knew he was truly protecting their safety.

“Tian Ge! Let us go back!”
“No, you all stay in San Shi Town. If I see you return, I’ll really take Xiao Wang and leave me, and I mean it.”

Su Nan Tian said this and hung up the phone.

Moreover, Su Nan Tian’s actions were very decisive. He directly pulled out the phone line from the village head’s house.

Xiao Chen and the others couldn’t even call back to persuade Su Nan Tian anymore.

As Su Nan Tian had predicted, he had just hung up the phone when Xiao Chen and the others repeatedly called this number without success. They couldn’t contact him anymore.

“Tian Ge is too harsh!” Xiao Chen hung up the phone and said angrily.

But upon thinking again, he knew Su Nan Tian was truly concerned about their safety. He wasn’t trying to abandon them.

So Xiao Chen sighed in relief, his face was very grim: “What should we do now? Don’t we care about this matter?”

They were worried about Su Nan Tian’s safety, and thinking of Su Nan Tian and Xiao Wang still in the small fishing village made them even more worried.

“What else can we do? Tian Ge already said this. He brought Xiao Wang out, so what can we do?”

Chen Xiaoling also sighed in relief and said to Xiao Chen. When she said this, she sat down with her head hanging low, very worried about Su Nan Tian’s safety.

But they all knew Su Nan Tian was a man of his word, and he could truly do what he said. If they returned now, it would really make Su Nan Tian take Xiao Wang and leave them behind.

“Right,” A Yu nodded. “Tian Ge will definitely do what he said.”

After saying this, A Yu sighed: “But if we don’t go back, I’m still worried about Tian Ge. These people are so dangerous; I don’t know if Tian Ge can cope with them.”

Upon hearing this, the others all hung their heads and had no spirit.

Thinking of these people who looked fierce and came with force, and recalling the previous group that was so fierce and killed all the villagers of the small fishing village, they were extremely worried.

They didn’t know if Su Nan Tian had a chance against these villains. And they also didn’t know if these people were stronger than the previous group.

“What should we do? I’m so worried about Tian Ge!”

After thinking of this, A Yu hung his head and was extremely worried about Su Nan Tian’s safety.

“Let’s just wait for news here. If Tian Ge is safe, he’ll definitely let us know.”

After thinking this through, Xiao Chen patted the shoulders of the other two to comfort them. Then he told them not to worry anymore.

Meanwhile, on the other side, after hanging up the phone, Su Nan Tian didn’t waste time. He quickly went to Wang Shu’s house and woke up Xiao Wang, saying: “Xiao Wang, some bad people are coming soon. Stay here quietly and don’t come out. I won’t return to find you, so don’t leave. Can you do that?”

“Uncle, are they the bad people who killed Grandpa?” Xiao Wang asked with childlike innocence after hearing Su Nan Tian’s words.

“No, they were the ones I already dealt with.”

Su Nan Tian knew that after going through these events, Xiao Wang was no longer a simple child. So he didn’t hide the truth from Xiao Wang but told him the facts.

“You can rest assured. These people are the same. Uncle will deal with them, but you mustn’t come out. If they see you, they’ll use you to threaten me, and I’ll have a big problem. So stay here quietly and don’t go out, okay?”

Su Nan Tian was worried that Xiao Wang might not understand the situation and run out upon hearing noise, so he woke up Xiao Wang to remind him.

Upon hearing this, Xiao Wang nodded obediently: “Yes, Uncle knows. I’ll be听话, I’ll stay here and not go anywhere. If you don’t come back, I won’t leave.”

Xiao Wang said this and looked at Su Nan Tian obediently.

“Good, Xiao Wang is听话.”

Su Nan Tian nodded in satisfaction and patted Xiao Wang’s head: “Stay quietly, Uncle will come back soon. After dealing with these people, I’ll return, okay?”

Upon hearing this, Xiao Wang nodded again: “Then Uncle must be careful. Don’t lie to me anymore. I don’t have anyone else but you.”

Xiao Wang’s mature words made Su Nan Tian’s heart ache.

If he had arrived earlier that day, the villagers of the small fishing village wouldn’t have died, and they could have saved everyone’s lives.

Upon thinking of this, Su Nan Tian closed his eyes and couldn’t bear to think further. He knew he couldn’t change the past by imagining it.

Now, all he could do was protect Xiao Wang and keep him from danger.

Chapter 932: Ambush?

He Wei led his subordinates, each holding weapons. Their faces were fierce as they rushed toward the small fishing village.

“Boss, where is this small fishing village? We’ve been walking so long and still haven’t arrived?” One of He Wei’s black-faced subordinates complained, his face full of exhaustion. His clothes were already soaked with sweat.

“Don’t talk about so many stupid things. This mission is to do something big. If you can’t even endure this hardship, you’ll only be a subordinate for life,” He Wei scolded. His inner feelings were also very troubled.

He flipped through the map repeatedly but still couldn’t tell north from south.

“Go on, find someone who can read the map!” He Wei kicked the black-faced subordinate in anger. The subordinate screamed and ran to find someone.

The others watched and laughed heartily, their eyes showing no sympathy. They treated it as a game in boredom. This journey was truly long, and whether they could catch Xiao Wang, they didn’t care.

They were just following He Wei for better prospects. If it wasn’t worth it, one meal a day was enough.

While everyone laughed heartily, a dull-witted person walked up to He Wei’s side. He directly rotated the map 180 degrees and smiled foolishly at He Wei.

This smile in He Wei’s eyes was like mocking him for not knowing north from south. His foolish and simple appearance seemed to say, “You’re no better than a fool.”

He Wei shoved the map into his hands: “You go ahead and lead us to the small fishing village. Catch Xiao Wang, then kill Su Nan Tian as well.” Then he left under the pretense of going to the forest to urinate.

He Wei walked further and further in anger. This person had publicly humiliated him, not knowing the map. It was too much. He had already planned a complete punishment for this fool, and he would deal with him properly once they reached the small fishing village.

Sss—

Qin Wei whistled, letting himself go. He used his waist strength and watched each time he flew farther. Just as he was about to try again, a tiger suddenly rushed out from the front and pounced at him.

He was so scared he didn’t even have time to pull up his pants. He rolled and ran backward, but still got scratched on the back.

Roar!

A loud roar echoed through the forest, shaking leaves to fall. Sharp fangs were exposed in the air, flashing a cold glint.

Combined with the deafening roar, He Wei shivered and immediately shouted: “Help! A tiger!”

“Save me!”

He Wei’s voice was hoarse, his throat nearly torn apart. But no one came to help him. He trembled and stood up, trying to appear calm.

Today, He Wei was destined to face this tiger alone. Because while he went to urinate, the headstrong subordinate had already followed his instructions and rushed toward the small fishing village.

Qin Wei saw no one coming to help, so he ran away. He constantly regretted not bringing his weapon with him when he went to the toilet, otherwise he wouldn’t have been so embarrassed.

He Wei ran around like a headless fly in the forest, while the fierce tiger quickly chased after him. He was about to be scratched again when he cleverly jumped onto a tree and quickly climbed up, reaching a high position swiftly. The whole process was unusually fast, like a monkey’s agility.

The tiger helplessly roared under the tree, circling it. It wasn’t that tigers couldn’t climb trees; it was just this tree was too straight, and the tiger didn’t want to give up. It sat under the tree, staring at He Wei with two copper-like tiger eyes.

Meanwhile, the dull-witted subordinate led He Wei’s group quickly forward. They sang happy mountain songs, as if they wanted no one to notice them. As the leader, He Wei was completely forgotten, as if he had never existed.

A Dai constantly adjusted his direction and took a shortcut. In this way, they quickly moved forward until the sky darkened. Finally, they reached near the small fishing village.

But they didn’t know danger was quietly approaching. Especially at night, he had been observing them for a long time. The reason he hadn’t acted was mainly because this dull-witted person had no martial strength, but his brain was still okay.

After waiting for a long time without anyone else coming, he assumed it was only these people to kill him. It was too small; he looked down on them.

Su Nan Tian moved like the wind through the night, silently approaching this group.

Crack!

A crisp sound rang out as one person fell to the ground. Upon seeing someone mysteriously fall, the group became chaotic and looked fearfully at the dark place.

The more they looked, the more fearful they became. Some people, out of fear, thought about fleeing. Su Nan Tian saw this and felt no sympathy for human weakness.

After all, the more isolated one is, the easier they are to kill.

A Dai looked at each person falling down and his expression was also fearful. But his mind remained clear. For them to survive, they needed to unite and find the hidden enemy.

He shouted loudly: “Quickly form a circle! Everyone quickly form a circle!”

The confused people found their leader and immediately huddled together, searching for the enemy hiding in the darkness.

Su Nan Tian watched this dull-witted person. Although he was terrified himself, he remained relatively calm.

But everything A Dai did, to Su Nan Tian, was like a child’s game. It had no effect at all. Even if these people formed a circle, every ten minutes someone would fall.

Endless fear spread among the group. Some people even knelt and begged for mercy. The unknown was always the most terrifying. If Su Nan Tian had appeared before them, they might have fought to the death. But facing an enemy in the dark, they only felt fear.

At this moment, their leader He Wei was wearing torn clothes. His pants were completely torn off, and his legs were covered with scratches and bloodstains. He looked as disheveled as he could be. He seemed to see the village ahead, and his eyes finally showed a glimmer of hope.

The village was dark with no lights. It seemed no one was there. He Wei found it strange that all the houses were dark at night and everyone went to bed so early. What was the point of living if you slept this early?

He Wei knocked on doors of several houses, but no one answered. He entered a few rooms and found no one there. Even the water in the jars was gone, leaving him both helpless and desperate.

Chapter 933: Success

Just as he was about to give up, he suddenly heard movement in the next room. This rekindled his extinguished hope.

He quickly walked to the next room and knocked on the door, shouting: “Is anyone there? Is anyone there? Is anyone there? I’m a passerby, lost in the mountains. I just want some water to drink.”

After waiting for a while without an answer, he simply pushed the door open and searched the kitchen. He finally found water and drank it greedily, with droplets spilling from both sides, soaking his clothes without the slightest care.

“Ah!”

He took a cold drink and let out a satisfied sigh, then burped. He patted his round belly, feeling very fulfilled. If only there was some grilled meat, it would be perfect.

When he put down the water bucket and looked at the door again, he seemed to see a flash of light. He chuckled: “I saw you. Don’t be afraid. I’m just lost in the mountains and chased by a tiger. I passed here to rest.”

He Wei explained this, fearing that the person inside would misunderstand and not come out.

He Wei looked around the courtyard. Suddenly, he saw a shadow in a dark corner and quietly moved toward it, afraid of disturbing the person.

When he got closer, he was surprised to find a child. In this desolate village, there was a child. This made him feel strange and curious.

“Little boy, why are you alone in this village? Where did your parents go? Everyone else from the village?” he asked instinctively.

The child was frightened, looking at this man with torn clothes and fierce scars. His small heart pounded rapidly.

“Don’t be afraid. Tell me, maybe I can help you,” He Wei said earnestly. If his subordinates saw this expression, they wouldn’t believe that He Wei had such a kind side.

Upon hearing He Wei’s words, the child gradually lowered his guard. His voice trembled as he said: “They’re all dead. Killed by bad people. My uncle saved me and drove them away.”

The child said this, tears flowing from his eyes.

“Killed? Everyone in the village was killed. That’s cruel. Where is your uncle? I need to ask for directions. After I finish my business, I’ll come back and help you with revenge,” He Wei said seriously. The fact that the whole village was slaughtered didn’t stir any emotion in him.

“My uncle went to fight the bad people. He’ll be back soon,” the child said, his voice no longer trembling.

“Oh, another group of bad people came?” He Wei narrowed his eyes, sensing something strange. Bad people, village slaughter—another group had come. He thought of a possibility.

“What’s the name of this village?” He Wei cleverly didn’t directly ask where the small fishing village was. He was very suspicious that this place was the small fishing village.

“Small Fishing Village!” The child answered without realizing the danger approaching. His claws were gradually moving toward him.

When He Wei heard these three words, a flicker of excitement appeared in his pupils. He hadn’t expected to accidentally arrive at the small fishing village. According to what this child had said, the villagers were killed by Qin Wu’s group. It seemed they had already been killed by this child’s uncle.

To kill Qin Wu’s group, this uncle must be very strong. He might be Su Nan Tian. At this moment, He Wei suppressed his excitement and steadied his slightly trembling hands.
