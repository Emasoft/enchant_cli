Chapter 464: Waiting

Su Nantian had never met the Wu family before, but through the information provided by Song Lichen, he was already familiar with these two men. The older of the two must be the elder brother, Huang Zhizhong, while the younger was his sibling, Huang Zhiwei. They were both candidates vying for the Wu family's inheritance.

As they approached Nangong Ping and Nangong Yuyan, their faces bore smiles of flattery and obsequiousness. This was because the Wu family had long relied on the Nangong family for survival. In fact, if one of them secured the Nangong family's open support, their position as heir would be all but assured.

Yet Nangong Ping and Nangong Yuyan were not so naive. Their positions as heirs within the Nangong family had yet to be decided, and they had no leisure to support others.

“Nangong Shaoye, Nangong Xiaojie, you have arrived,” Huang Zhizhong greeted them first, his demeanor clearly that of a man adept at navigating social intricacies.

Nangong Ping and Nangong Yuyan nodded in response, and Huang Zhiwei added, “We have been waiting for you both for quite some time.”

“Did you arrive so early? Then tell us what the situation is. Has the Wu family sent anyone out?” Nangong Yuyan asked directly.

“We arrived quite early, but despite this long wait, we have yet to see any Wu family official step forward. A cousin from the Wu family did appear briefly, exchanging pleasantries before returning. Since then, it has been Wu Jingzhong who has remained to entertain the guests.” Huang Zhizhong recounted what had transpired since his arrival.

Nangong Ping rubbed his chin, murmuring, “What is going on? The Wu family usually maintains proper etiquette. Why this lack of courtesy in such a significant matter as the inheritance contest? Even if the heir has not yet been decided and factions are at odds, someone should have stepped forward to greet the guests. This is truly unseemly.”

Nangong Ping was correct—among the five major families, reputation was paramount. No matter how they bickered internally, when outsiders arrived, they would unite to uphold their dignity. For instance, Nangong Ping and Nangong Yuyan would never allow internal rivalry to overshadow their unity when representing the Nangong family. Thus, the Wu family’s current behavior was most unusual.

“Indeed,” Huang Zhiwei concurred. “We have been waiting here for so long, and the other families’ guests are already murmuring in discontent. Yet aside from Wu Jingzhong, no one else has appeared.”

Su Nantian listened in silence, his mind troubled. He could not fathom what had transpired within the Wu family, but he hoped nothing untoward had occurred. That would ensure safety for Wu You’er and Wu Tao’s family.

“Indeed, this is most unusual,” Nangong Yuyan said. “I wonder what has happened to the Wu family.”

At that moment, a voice rang out from the other side: “Esteemed guests of the five major families, your journey here has been arduous. I am honored to welcome you on behalf of the Wu family.”

As if summoned by the words, just as Nangong Ping and Nangong Yuyan had criticized the Wu family’s lack of courtesy, a member of the Wu family now emerged.

Though the guests were all discontented with the Wu family’s poor hospitality, they said nothing further once someone had arrived.

Yet a discordant voice rose: “What is the Wu family doing? You’ve gathered everyone here with such fanfare, yet now you offer nothing but a hollow gesture!”

Su Nantian turned curiously at the speaker, for he had assumed no family besides the Huangs would dare challenge the Wu family. Yet here stood a young man, his tone brimming with arrogance.

“This Wang family’s little lord is quite bold,” Huang Zhiwei chuckled. “Though we too lack respect for the Wu family, at least we should feign courtesy.”

It turned out to be a member of the Wang family. Su Nantian had not expected the Wangs, who held no enmity with the Wu family, to be the first to take such a stance.

“This Wang family’s little lord is utterly arrogant and domineering. He has only recently come of age, having been released by Grandfather Wang to move among the family. He is expected to learn proper etiquette and secure his place as heir. After all, he is the sole son of the Wang family, spoiled and arrogant by nature—this can be understood. Yet I had not expected him to act so recklessly.” Huang Zhizhong explained, eager to ensure Nangong Ping and Nangong Yuyan understood the situation.

Yet Nangong Ping and Nangong Yuyan seemed indifferent, a fact that benefited Su Nantian. This information was absent from his file, and Song Lichen knew little of the Wang family’s recent emergence.

“Ah,” the Wu family member said, bowing deeply to the gathered guests. “We apologize for our oversight. I represent the Wu family in welcoming you all.”

Seeing his sincere bow, no family could continue to complain. Even the Wang family’s little lord, accustomed to arrogance, realized that pressing further would be impolite.

Chapter 465: The Harsh Truth

After the Wu family member bowed and apologized, Su Nantian expected him to announce the next steps in the Wu family’s inheritance contest. Instead, the man smiled and said, “You all have traveled far; I trust you are tired. I shall have the servants guide each of you to your rooms for rest. We will gather everyone for dinner tonight and introduce the candidates vying for the Wu family’s inheritance.”

As he spoke, the Wu family member clapped his hands, and numerous servants approached. They led each guest to their designated room.

Su Nantian and his companion, Wang Meng, were assigned separate rooms, though they too had their own accommodations nearby. Yet now was not the time to rest.

“Sit down, you two,” Nangong Ping said as they entered the room. “In private, you may relax a little.”

“Master,” Su Nantian ventured cautiously. “This situation seems suspicious.”

“What do you mean?” Nangong Ping asked, unimpressed. “What is suspicious about it?”

“We came here to observe the Wu family’s inheritance contest, did we not?” Su Nantian pressed.

“Indeed,” Nangong Ping replied. “So what is suspicious? Have you noticed something?”

Nangong Ping’s dismissive tone made Su Nantian hesitant. Yet he reminded himself that he had never participated in these family rivalries before, so his lack of understanding was natural. He steeled himself and said, “We were invited to witness the Wu family’s competition among heirs. Yet so far, no heir has appeared. We do not even know how the contest will proceed. Is it merely to dine and drink?”

Su Nantian’s words caused Nangong Ping to laugh.

“Nantian, you are new here and unaware of the rules. In truth, there are no set guidelines for how the heirs of the five major families compete. We have been invited to stay here for three days, during which the heirs will maneuver themselves to connect with us. They will seek our votes discreetly, and whoever secures the most votes shall become heir.”

Before Nangong Ping could finish, Wang Meng interjected. Having spent years in the Nangong family, he understood more than Su Nantian.

Upon hearing Wang Meng’s explanation, Su Nantian suddenly understood. The competition had already begun. That was why no Wu family member had appeared to greet them.

It was because if any faction’s representative had approached, they would have already established contact with the major families.

In truth, the competition had begun the moment these families’ representatives set foot in the Wu family’s domain. The goal was to connect with these major families secretly, securing their support—equivalent to votes. In the end, whoever secured the most would inherit the Wu family.

This meant that at any moment, any Wu family member could launch an attack.

Su Nantian shivered involuntarily at the thought.

Because of Kyoto’s unique nature and the five major families’ special dynamics, even their inheritance contests had to consider the balance of power among these families. If one could not secure alliances with others, they had no right to be heir.

“Wang Meng is correct, but not entirely. On the surface, it seems like a simple campaign for votes or offering limited promises to others. But you know I told you before that my presence here is dangerous. The Wu family’s inheritance contest involves the selection of heirs across all five families, and it is a matter of life and death.”

At this, Nangong Ping suddenly stood up, his voice low.

Su Nantian shivered involuntarily. The competition among the five major families was far more perilous than he had imagined.

On the surface, it seemed like a simple campaign for votes, but beneath that lay the reality: if an opponent died, one would have fewer rivals. And this method was tacitly accepted by all.

Even more terrifying was that other families might be drawn into the fray.

“Still, I and Yuyan have agreed to act in unison when outside. Thus, we will not demand the Wu family’s heir to assassinate another. But while we must not harbor murderous intent, vigilance is essential. We must proceed with caution. It’s not just internal family strife; at this very moment, another family may wish for my or Yuyan’s death. These could be conditions the Wu family uses to secure support from other families. The complexities are endless, which is why we said coming here was dangerous.”

As Nangong Ping spoke, Su Nantian fully understood. He had previously thought the matter was merely a private campaign for votes and camaraderie, but now he realized that the competition among heirs was indeed a battle of life and death—and one that could involve other families.

But this was precisely the nature of Kyoto’s five major families, which had created such a brutal process. And this process was unavoidable.

The most important factor was that as long as the five major families endured, their intricate web of relationships would persist. Thus, this tradition and rule would continue to exist.

Yet Su Nantian’s thoughts were not merely about the heirs of these five families; he was more concerned with Wu You’er and Wu Tao’s family.

If his intelligence had been correct, they had been forcibly taken back by the Wu family to participate in this competition.

All competitors would be forced into combat and face death. Su Nantian could not help but feel a knot of worry, wondering how ordinary people like them could survive in such circumstances.

Chapter 466: Submission

Upon hearing Nangong Ping’s account of the Wu family’s fierce competition, Su Nantian felt his concern deepen.

After all, Wu You’er and Wu Tao’s family had never been involved in the Wu family’s rivalry. In fact, they had fled the Wu family years ago to escape this life of power struggles and deceit.

Yet they could never have imagined that, after so many years, they would be forcibly returned to the Wu family—this time to participate in the inheritance contest.

And as Nangong Ping had said, it was not just these competitors who faced life-threatening dangers. The Wu family’s heirs were the first to be targeted.

But Wu You’er and Wu Tao’s family would never actively harm others, leaving them in a passive position. They could only meet threats head-on and defend themselves—making their survival chances extremely slim.

The more Su Nantian thought, the more he felt uneasy. He needed to find a way to contact Wu You’er and Wu Tao’s family quickly, so he could determine how to assist them. Without this, it would be difficult for him to provide effective help.

“What should we do now, Master?” Wang Meng asked at this moment.

Nangong Ping sat on the chair, sipped his tea, and shook his head before saying, “Our main issue now is that we do not yet know the internal power structure of the Wu family. Because the Wu family is so chaotic, we have no idea how they are aligned internally. If we wish to remain neutral in this matter, the first step is to understand their current power distribution. That way, when someone approaches us, we will know how to respond.”

Su Nantian agreed with Nangong Ping’s words. At this moment, the matters Nangong Ping raised seemed quite reasonable to him.

Though Nangong Ping was unremarkable, he had managed to survive within the Nangong family and still had supporters behind him. This suggested he was not without talent.

Thus, Su Nantian felt that Nangong Ping’s words were indeed correct. If they truly wished to get involved in the Wu family’s conflict, they must first understand its internal structure.

“But we are limited; we can’t just go out and investigate the Wu family’s situation ourselves,” Wang Meng said, scratching his head. He was naturally confused about this part.

Su Nantian smiled and looked at Nangong Ping, saying, “We don’t need to take the initiative. There are plenty of people who will come to us with Nangong family’s reputation. Once we ask a few questions, we’ll know about the internal power structure.”

“Lan Tian is right. That’s how it should be. We just need to wait here. From the moment we entered this room, countless eyes from the Wu family have been watching us. We don’t need to take action; just sitting here is enough.”

After Nangong Ping said this, he looked at Su Nantian with appreciation. His image of Su Nantian had grown even more impressive in his mind. He had previously thought Su Nantian was merely a man with strong martial skills, but now he realized that Su Nantian also thought deeply. Compared to Wang Meng, he was far superior.

However, before Nangong Ping had finished speaking, a doorbell rang outside.

Nangong Ping smiled and said, “Speak of the devil. If I’m not mistaken, it must be a member of the Wu family. Wang Meng, open the door.”

Wang Meng nodded and walked to the door. He looked through the peephole, confirming it was someone he didn’t recognize.

“Who is it?” Wang Meng asked without opening the door immediately.

“The Wu family’s Wu Ruotian has come to pay respects to Nangong Shaoye,” the man outside replied calmly.

Wang Meng glanced back at Nangong Ping, who nodded in approval. Wang Meng then opened the door.

The man named Wu Ruotian entered immediately and nodded to Nangong Ping, who was sitting on the sofa. “I assume you are Nangong Shaoye. I am Wu Ruotian, one of the candidates vying for the Wu family’s inheritance.”

Su Nantian stood behind Nangong Ping, observing this visitor. From the information he had received from Song Lichen earlier, it was clear that the Wu family’s main branch no longer had an heir. Thus, aside from Wu You’er and Wu Tao’s family—those returned from outside—the other candidates were likely from the collateral branches.

Wu Ruotian was certainly one of these collateral branch candidates.

After hearing this, Nangong Ping nodded and pointed to the sofa opposite him. “Sit down. You came quite quickly; we had just entered the room when you arrived.”

Nangong Ping’s words carried no praise or annoyance—just a neutral tone.

“I won’t beat around the bush with Nangong Shaoye. We are all from the five major families, and we know how important this inheritance contest is. Since you other families’ guests have arrived and settled in, we will naturally seek out our allies first. Especially with a family like the Nangong clan, I am very respectful of you. And personally, I hold great admiration for Nangong Shaoye. Thus, I came to you immediately.”

Wu Ruotian was skilled at flattery, complimenting both the Wu family and Nangong Ping.

Flattery was always welcome. Nangong Ping smiled, clearly satisfied.

“What do you want me to help you secure the Wu family’s inheritance? Tell me your conditions,” Nangong Ping said directly, cutting to the chase.

After all, Nangong Ping had no emotional ties with the other families’ heirs and thus had nothing to discuss but interests. For Nangong Ping, whoever approached him with the most enticing offers and feasible plans would be supported.

Thus, whether Nangong Ping decided to support Wu Ruotian for the Wu family’s inheritance hinged entirely on whether Wu Ruotian’s conditions were enticing enough. If they weren’t, Nangong Ping would never intervene.

Chapter 467: Hollow Promises

Nangong Ping now appeared like a leopard waiting for its prey, his sharp gaze fixed on Wu Ruotian sitting before him. He wore a cunning smile.

Su Nantian, observing from the side, felt that Nangong Ping had become even more charismatic than usual. Yet he also recognized Nangong Ping’s true nature—this man would never rise beyond this level. Given his current strength and abilities, he could not surpass this position.

Thus, Su Nantian believed that if the Nangong family truly wished to choose an heir beneficial to them, Nangong Ping was not a good choice. However, this was beyond Su Nantian’s concern. Moreover, they were currently discussing the Wu family’s inheritance issue.

Wu Ruotian smiled as he sat across from Nangong Ping and said, “The current situation among the five major families is quite chaotic. Even now, no family has a clear advantage over others. Although the Nangong family seems to be leading at present, your position is still constrained by the Wang family. Thus, you cannot dominate this situation.”

Wu Ruotian first analyzed the current state of the five major families before confidently stating, “If I wish for the Nangong family to secure a top position among the five major families, I believe the Wu family’s support is essential.”

“Oh? So you mean you can help us Nangong family secure the top position?” Nangong Ping said, continuing to watch Wu Ruotian with his sharp gaze.

Wu Ruotian nodded. “Indeed. If Nangong Shaoye supports me to become the next Wu family patriarch, then our entire Wu family will serve the Nangong family. Of course, this is under the premise that the Wu family remains independent and will be as loyal to you as the Huang family. Thus, with two families pledging allegiance to you, the Nangong family will easily dominate among the five major families.”

Nangong Ping had not expected Wu Ruotian to propose such a grand condition. Simply supporting him as the Wu family’s patriarch would mean the Wu family had already submitted to the Nangong family. This was indeed an enticing offer.

Yet Nangong Ping did not immediately agree but smiled and nodded, saying, “Indeed, your conditions are tempting. However, I cannot give you an immediate answer. There is still much time; I need to observe further. But I have remembered you, Wu Ruotian.”

After saying this, Nangong Ping glanced at Wang Meng and said, “Show him out.”

Wang Meng nodded immediately and approached Wu Ruotian. “Please leave, I will escort you.”

Wu Ruotian understood that even with such a grand promise, Nangong Ping would not agree immediately. Thus, he said, “Goodbye,” to Nangong Ping and left the room with Wang Meng’s accompaniment.

“Do you think I should accept him?” Nangong Ping asked Wang Meng and Su Nantian after he returned.

“Honestly, Wu Ruotian’s conditions are quite good. If he truly becomes the Wu family patriarch, his support for our Nangong family would indeed be a great advantage. I think we should consider it,” Wang Meng replied immediately, believing Wu Ruotian’s conditions were excellent.

“What do you think?” Nangong Ping turned to Su Nantian and asked.

Su Nantian merely furrowed his brow, clearly not in agreement with this view.

“I think it would be better not to cooperate with Wu Ruotian.”

Su Nantian’s words made Wang Meng immediately question, “Why? His conditions are clearly good. If the Wu family truly supports us Nangong family, that would be a great advantage.”

Wang Meng did not understand Su Nantian’s reasoning. In his view, Wu Ruotian had already offered the best conditions possible; no one else could surpass him.

Moreover, Wu Ruotian’s words were truthful—given the current state of the five major families, no one had a clear advantage. Even the Nangong family, considered strong, was constrained by others.

Thus, if the Wu family joined them, their alliance would expand, making the Nangong family the absolute leader among the five major families.

Yet Su Nantian shook his head, “Those who entrust their family’s future to another family for the sake of securing an inheritance position are untrustworthy and lack ability. Moreover, he may only be making a temporary arrangement. He claims to support the Nangong family now, but once he becomes Wu family patriarch, it’s uncertain. The more grand the conditions, the more unreliable they are. Especially since he approached us immediately, it proves he has no confidence and is merely making a hollow promise to secure the support of the most powerful family, the Nangong family. His plan is too simplistic.”

Su Nantian explained his thoughts clearly, and this time he did not hold back or deceive Nangong Ping. He had genuinely considered the matter from the Nangong family’s perspective and reached this conclusion.

After Su Nantian spoke, Nangong Ping nodded repeatedly, clearly agreeing with his words.

In his view, Wu Ruotian’s conditions were indeed good and impressive, but they were not trustworthy.

The more beautiful something appeared, the more illusory it was. Heaven would never rain cakes. If they entrusted their family’s future to another family for the sake of securing a mere patriarch position, it would prove they had no real foundation.

Such a family could offer no real support to the Nangong family.

“Su Nantian is right. I thought the same way. Wu Ruotian clearly has no cards to play, so he proposed such a grand condition in hopes of finding external support. If I’m not mistaken, among the Wu family’s inheritance candidates, he is likely the weakest. Moreover, he will probably propose the same conditions to other families in hopes of finding someone who believes his hollow promises.”

Nangong Ping said this while smiling and looked at Su Nantian with admiration. He was becoming increasingly interested in Su Nantian.

Chapter 468: Intention to Cultivate

After Wu Ruotian left, no one else came to see Nangong Ping. This struck Su Nantian as unusual—these inheritance candidates should be actively seeking connections, yet only Wu Ruotian had arrived.

However, Su Nantian did not ask aloud. After all, his current role was merely that of a bodyguard for the Nangong family. He had no authority to inquire about such matters. The previous conversation was initiated by Nangong Ping, so Su Nantian could voice his opinion. But after that, if Nangong Ping did not ask him, he would remain silent.

Thus, Su Nantian would not bring up the matter if Nangong Ping did not. He simply waited patiently.

Yet Su Nantian had no idea that someone was more impatient than himself.

At this moment, Wang Meng rubbed his head and said, “Master, why did only Wu Ruotian come today? Does that mean he alone wants our Nangong family’s support?”

This surprised Su Nantian. He had not expected someone to raise this question, but it was a relief that he did.

Nangong Ping smiled and said, “Indeed. Usually, this is when the inheritance candidates begin to campaign for votes. However, Wu Ruotian is an exception. His conditions were too grand and vague to allow for detailed negotiations.”

“Thus, compared to other inheritance candidates, he spent very little time with each potential ally. And since he came to me, it means others have already secured their support.” Other inheritance candidates would not propose such vague conditions as Wu Ruotian, so they took longer to negotiate details.”

“Thus, these inheritance candidates can only connect with one or two people during the evening. It is normal that they did not come to you, Master.” Su Nantian continued, following Nangong Ping’s words. Since Wang Meng had initiated the discussion, Su Nantian was not afraid to speak.

“Indeed, this is likely the case. As for where these people went, I have a rough idea.” Nangong Ping said with an air of calm confidence.

Yet this attitude seemed impressive to Wang Meng, but Su Nantian saw it as nothing special. After all, he had already thought of the same things.

Wang Meng looked puzzled and asked, “Where did these people go? Shouldn’t they be targeting our Nangong family first? Even with the Wang family, only one candidate can go there.”

Wang Meng’s thoughts were clear—he knew the Wang family could only send one candidate.

Nangong Ping did not answer directly but instead looked at Su Nantian and said, “Nantian, what do you think?” From the beginning, Nangong Ping had developed a strong interest in Su Nantian. He realized that not only was Su Nantian skilled in combat, but he also had sharp strategic thinking. Thus, he intended to cultivate Su Nantian as his right-hand man.

Upon hearing Nangong Ping’s question, Su Nantian feigned contemplation for a moment before saying, “There are four major families besides the Wu family. This time, the Wu family has four inheritance candidates. Since Wu Ruotian came to you, the other three must have gone to the Wang family, Song family, and Miss Nangong.”

After Su Nantian said this, Wang Meng asked curiously, “Why didn’t they go to the Huang family? Since Wu Ruotian approached you, others shouldn’t have come to Miss Nangong, right?”

Nangong Ping smiled and shook his head. “You’re wrong. Nantian’s guess was correct. Nantian, explain it to him.”

After hearing this, Su Nantian nodded and said, “The Wang family needs no explanation. It is the second-largest family after the Nangong family, matching us in strength. However, since we have the Huang family’s support, we are slightly superior. This means the Huang family follows our lead. Thus, there is no need to approach them; once we reach an agreement with the Nangong family, the Huang family’s votes will naturally be secured. Master, am I right?”

After Su Nantian said this, Nangong Ping smiled and nodded. “Indeed, you are right. The Huang family has always followed our lead and would never support another.”

Su Nantian smiled and continued, “The other person must have gone to the Song family. As for the last one, it is likely they went to Miss Nangong. They may have thought that since Miss Nangong and Master are competitors for the inheritance, they could create a rift. However, they do not know that we have an internal agreement and will not split when facing outsiders. Thus, someone must have gone to Miss Nangong. That is my speculation.”

After Su Nantian spoke, Nangong Ping clapped his hands and praised him for the insightful analysis. Indeed, this was what he had also considered.

At that moment, the door was knocked on again. Yet Su Nantian did not even look up before saying, “It’s probably Miss Nangong.”

Wang Meng heard this and immediately walked to the door, peering through the peephole. “You’re a genius! It really is Miss Nangong!”

After saying this, Wang Meng immediately opened the door. Nangong Yuyan walked in herself; since her room was adjacent to Nangong Ping’s, she did not need a bodyguard. It was only a few steps away.

“Who came to see you?” Nangong Yuyan asked directly upon entering, without any hesitation.

“Wu Ruotian,” Nangong Ping replied. “But this man is not reliable; we just had a casual chat.”

“What conditions did Wu Ruotian offer you?” Nangong Yuyan asked, unaware of Wu Ruotian’s tactics since he had not approached her.

“He said that once he becomes the Wu family patriarch, the entire Wu family will be as loyal to you as the Huang family. Do you think I can believe that?” Nangong Ping smiled, clearly unimpressed.

“That’s certainly not believable. Even the Huang family would not be trusted now, let alone the Wu family.” Nangong Yuyan said coldly.

Chapter 469: Conditions

Nangong Yuyan’s words would be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the relationship between the Huang and Nangong families. However, Su Nantian understood them easily.

From the information provided by Song Lichen earlier, he had learned about the relationship between the Huang and Nangong families. At that time, Su Nantian had been puzzled as to why only the Huang family would submit to another. Given their current strength, they were on par with other families and not one that had to rely on another for survival.

Because of this, Su Nantian had questioned it deeply and later sought information about the Huang family’s history with the Nangong family. He discovered why the Huang family had submitted to the Nangong family.

The Nangong family’s ancestors had once been emperors, and the Huang family was their most loyal minister. They had served as advisors for several dynasties, guarding the Nangong royal family. However, after the fall of the dynasty, these Nangong family members had to flee into exile. The royal family protected them during their escape.

Later, with the change of dynasties, the relationship between the Huang and Nangong families remained unchanged.

Fortunately, the Nangong family had not been foolish when fleeing the palace; they had taken some wealth with them. Moreover, their ancestors had anticipated that no dynasty would last forever and had left a substantial fortune for future generations of the Nangong family.
