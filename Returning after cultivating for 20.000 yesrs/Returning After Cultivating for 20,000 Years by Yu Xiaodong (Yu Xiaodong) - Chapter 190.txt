He scrutinized the isolated pillars once more. Suddenly, Su Nantian seemed to awaken to a realization—these pillars appeared chaotic but concealed profound mysteries. He nearly fell for their deception, sensing an extraordinary connection between them.

This mechanism required a specific method to unlock. Su Nantian felt an eerie familiarity with this concept, and then it struck him—this was a formation designed to conceal objects. The moment these thoughts surfaced, he himself was startled by his own knowledge. He puzzled over why he knew this.

After prolonged observation, Su Nantian still failed to decipher the secret. He decided to summon the two below and consult them, thus avoiding unnecessary speculation.

Su Nantian lowered a vine along the cliffside and waited anxiously. He doubted whether the two below had already plummeted, as the vine remained motionless for an eternity. How could it move so sluggishly?

It was like a snail's pace. If he hadn't yet unraveled the pillars' secret, he wouldn't have waited for these two. His time was invaluable; if this matter could conclude swiftly, it would be ideal.

Impatient, Su Nantian instructed A Dai and descended the vine himself. When he reached the bottom, he gazed downward but saw no figures. He shouted loudly, yet received no response. Su Nantian doubted whether these two had perished.

Had the old man slipped and fallen to his death?

As Su Nantian prepared to leave, he suddenly heard a faint sound, as if from afar. He focused intently downward and discerned the old man's voice. This bewildered him—why was this man moving so sluggishly? Could it be that even this short distance required an entire day to traverse?

Su Nantian decisively severed a vine, fastened it around his waist, and descended by hand. After descending 500 meters, he finally glimpsed their figures. He waited a moment before they gradually grew larger.

When Kuanglong saw Su Nantian hanging on the cliffside gazing downward, his lips twitched involuntarily. This youth's stamina was beyond comprehension—truly astonishing.

He couldn't afford to lose face before the little white-haired one. Though it was already too late, he hoisted Kuang Qingya onto his back and suddenly accelerated. With a powerful thrust of his hands and feet, the two leaped upward like a toad, repeatedly bouncing.

They soon reached Su Nantian's position. Kuanglong suppressed the scorching heat in his chest and calmly greeted Su Nantian.

Su Nantian said nothing, simply handing over the rope. "Fasten it around your waist; I'll carry you both up."

Upon hearing this, Kuanglong's head throbbed. Was this man even human? He intended to carry both of them up! Kuang Qingya was light, but its weight was undeniable.

Though Kuanglong found it effortless to carry A Dai, this weight could never compare to A Dai's. If this youth encountered a crisis, they might all plummet off the cliff.

The probability of such an event seemed high to Kuanglong. After a brief hesitation, he said, "Young master, having ambition is good, but excessive arrogance is dangerous."

"Then if you two can match my speed, I have no objections," Su Nantian replied calmly.

Kuanglong fell silent. His speed was slow, a fact he couldn't deny. His cultivation method had provided little enhancement to his velocity, and his physical agility was far from adequate.

In the end, he accepted the rope and fastened it around his waist before hoisting Kuang Qingya onto his back. He regarded Su Nantian with suspicion.

Chapter 949: Provocation

Kuanglong groaned continuously below, but Su Nantian ignored him and continued climbing recklessly.

Soon, Su Nantian led the two to the summit. Feeling the frigid air at the peak, Kuanglong vomited immediately—he had been dragged up forcefully.

To this day, his mind was still dizzy. He gazed at Su Nantian with the eyes of a monster. How could this man not feel tired? He had climbed for so long without showing any signs of exhaustion. His stamina was truly astonishing.

At this moment, Kuang Qingya felt dizzy and couldn't see a single person. Her body instinctively prepared to collapse, expecting Su Nantian to catch her with his strong arms. But those arms never arrived. It wasn't until his face touched the ground that he realized.

He instantly regained clarity, gazing at Su Nantian's distant back with a cold snort. What an obstinate blockhead! He had shown so clearly, yet this man still couldn't perceive it.

Kuang Qingya snorted and slowly got up. She gazed at Su Nantian with a sense of loss, but quickly composed herself. Since childhood, she had never lacked anything; whatever she desired was always obtained by those around her.

Su Nantian must be hers. No one could take him from her—she would destroy him if she couldn't have him.

Kuang Qingya cast a resentful glance at Su Nantian.

Kuanglong slowly got up and gazed at his daughter. He didn't wish to say much; this girl's decisions were impossible to change, her stubbornness was legendary.

Hadn't it been obvious earlier? That handsome youth didn't like her at all.

After Su Nantian gathered all the vines, he said slowly, "You should have the key here."

Upon hearing this, Kuanglong was startled. He hadn't expected this youth's eyesight to be so sharp—immediately recognizing the hidden mysteries. He laughed heartily, "You've truly seen through its subtleties. This is indeed an illusion; the true treasure lies within."

Saying this, Kuanglong took out a jade pendant from his waist and approached the third stone pillar on the left. He found a slot perfectly matching the jade pendant and inserted it.

Nine stone pillars trembled, shaking the air violently as if a nine-level earthquake were approaching. After a brief moment, the trembling ceased. Each pillar's top emitted a single beam of light that converged into one point, forming a white vortex.

Kuanglong smiled, "This is the entrance to the secret realm. Only with a jade pendant can it be opened. Young master, please."

He then took a leap into the white vortex and stepped in. Kuang Qingya cast Su Nantian an怨恨 glance before stepping forward as well.

Su Nantian hesitated not a moment, following them into the vortex with A Dai. This was no more than a minor trick; as long as his strength was sufficient, he had no fear of anything.

When Su Nantian entered the white vortex, the nine stone pillars' lights gradually dimmed. Before his eyes was a vast expanse of white, nothing else. A moment later, the view transformed into lush forests.

Kuanglong and Kuang Qingya were just ahead.

This was the secret realm of the Falling Crimson Mountains, guarded by nine sects. Only those with a jade pendant could enter. Each year, the quota for these nine sects changed, and every change resulted in countless sacrifices.

Kuanglong said calmly, his tone devoid of emotion as if merely stating a fact.

But Su Nantian could sense that this man was indeed a cunning fox, feigning vulnerability.

"If you can assist me, I won't stand by idly. Offering a helping hand isn't impossible," Su Nantian said coolly, his tone equally devoid of emotion. Such a fair exchange was natural; he had no aversion to it.

"Then I'll proceed first. Thank you, young master," Kuanglong said with a smile. "We're twenty kilometers away from the destination. I can move quickly on flat ground."

Kuanglong said with a grin, not believing this youth could outrun him.

His reputation as Kuanglong wasn't earned in vain. In terms of speed, he at least ranked among the top three.

Su Nantian said nothing and immediately hoisted A Dai onto his back. He followed closely behind Kuanglong without attempting to overtake him, as he was unfamiliar with the path and having a guide was best.

Kuanglong led Kuang Qingya in a furious sprint, leaving deep pits behind with each step. He felt proud and doubted this youth could catch up.

But soon, his expression turned grim as he noticed Su Nantian trailing him closely without any intention of distancing himself.

Who said he hadn't unleashed his full power? This youth was truly remarkable.

Kuanglong inwardly sneered, and his speed suddenly surged. His figure became like a lightning bolt, rushing forward swiftly.

As Su Nantian narrowed his eyes to follow, a fierce beast suddenly lunged from the side. It opened its maw wide and charged at Su Nantian.

Su Nantian halted, delivering a kick to the beast's face. The beast's facial features were severely damaged, but it only retreated tens of meters before stopping.

Su Nantian observed the vertical sword marks on its body and its massive size. No wonder it had only retreated tens of meters.

This creature was truly enormous; even most people would find it difficult to make it retreat tens of meters.

Though Su Nantian didn't know what this creature was, he could sense its immense power. Even he had to be cautious.

Su Nantian stopped chasing Kuanglong and stood still, facing the beast. The beast seemed provoked and roared angrily, charging at Su Nantian with a furious roar, its feet creating deep pits as it leaped into the air.

Its massive body plummeted toward Su Nantian and Kuang Qingya. If this attack landed, both would be crushed into dust, merging with the earth.

But Su Nantian showed no fear or hesitation. He stared intently at the falling monstrosity and raised his hand.

In a single motion, the massive creature neither fell nor was repelled—it floated effortlessly in Su Nantian's palm.

If Kuanglong saw this, he would be stunned. This was nothing short of a miracle.

Saying it crudely, Su Nantian slightly bent his arm. The beast struggled violently before being flung far away, crashing into a thicket of bushes and even causing the earth to tremble.

Su Nantian cast a cold glance at the motionless beast, then quickly resumed his pursuit of Kuanglong.

Chapter 950: Who Would It Be?

Not long after, three figures fell beside the beast's corpse. Seeing the dead creature, they all displayed expressions of shock. This was a monster they had long struggled to subdue; they had planned to tame it, but now it was dead in an instant.

They examined the wounds. The only additional wound was a clear palm print on its abdomen, but its internal organs had been shattered into liquid.

They exchanged glances and shook their heads in unison.

After all, this was a rhinoceros-armored beast. Its armor had even eluded the Grand Elder's attacks. If someone could kill it with just a single palm, who was this person?

Perhaps one of the nine sects had produced an extraordinary figure they were unaware of. This matter needed careful handling.

After dividing the rhinoceros-armored beast's armor among themselves, they each departed in different directions.

Kuanglong, after accelerating, noticed the youth hadn't caught up. He let out a triumphant laugh. At last, he had shaken off this youth and washed away the humiliation.

As he prepared to slow down and wait for the youth, a voice suddenly echoed in his ears. "How much longer until we reach the destination?" Su Nantian said coolly.

Kuanglong turned his head, startled. How had this youth arrived beside him without him noticing? It was too eerie.

A Dai smiled and waved a greeting to Kuanglong.

But this seemed like mockery to Kuanglong. How slow he was, taking half a day to arrive.

Kuanglong said nothing and increased his speed again. But this time, he couldn't shake Su Nantian off. No matter how fast he went or changed direction, this youth always followed closely. Eventually, he gave up.

He abruptly stopped and took a few deep breaths.

Su Nantian also halted, but his breathing remained undisturbed.

Kuanglong watched this and cursed Su Nantian countless times in his mind. He couldn't understand how someone could be so enduring, not even breathing heavily.

If Kuanglong knew that Su Nantian had just killed a rhinoceros-armored beast, he would have been speechless.

He slightly pointed ahead. Su Nantian followed his finger's direction and saw a black tower tip hidden among the trees, piercing the sky. Suddenly, Su Nantian's eyes narrowed. Just by observing the tower tip, he could sense it was no ordinary structure; its dark material was unlike any he had seen before.

"Rest a moment. I'll check around the tower first," Su Nantian said and entered the forest.

Kuanglong couldn't help but curse. This youth was too arrogant. Without his guidance, entering recklessly was tantamount to seeking death.

Nine sects—none were unfamiliar with each other. A stranger entering recklessly would surely suffer.

Kuanglong sneered. He wouldn't bother to warn this youth. If he was so eager, let him suffer first. When the youth was surrounded and attacked, Kuanglong would rescue him, making this youth grateful.

He thought about it and couldn't help but grin. He was very eager to see the upcoming drama. If this youth could be thoroughly humiliated, he would be more than happy.

Kuanglong didn't rest. He took out a small bottle and released a tiny insect from the mouth. Kuanglong recited some incantations, and the insect seemed to understand his words, circling him before flying toward Su Nantian's direction.

"What are you doing?" Kuang Qingya asked her father, puzzled.

"Girls shouldn't meddle in adult matters. Just watch quietly," Kuanglong said gruffly. This girl had been turning her back on him since meeting Su Nantian.

Hmph!

Kuanglong wasn't foolish enough to follow directly. This youth was sharp; he hadn't noticed him approaching earlier. If he followed, this youth would surely detect his presence and suspect something. Then if those people discovered it, he'd be considered an accomplice. How could he then watch Su Nantian being bullied?

Kuanglong immediately sat cross-legged and silently sensed the insect. This insect had been raised by him for many years; it was his precious little companion, always effective in tracking and searching.

Su Nantian led A Dai into the forest's depths. Soon, he saw the tower in its entirety—nine levels of black stone, emitting a mysterious glow. Su Nantian observed it for a moment and felt as if he were being sucked in.

He looked back at A Dai, who had gone blank-eyed. Su Nantian pressed his hand on A Dai's head, and after a while, A Dai gradually regained consciousness, breathing heavily as if he had just survived a life-or-death battle.

Su Nantian descended downward. As soon as he left the dense forest, he was surrounded by several people. They held sharp weapons and blocked his path with hostile expressions.

"You are who?" One of the men, with a fierce appearance, asked.

"Of course, I'm here to enter the tower," Su Nantian replied loudly.

"To enter the tower? Ha! Do you have proof of identity?" The fierce man looked at Su Nantian with a surge of anger.

"Proof?" Su Nantian thought for a moment. "The one behind."

"You don't have proof, so you can't enter," another man said immediately and drew his sword, pointing it at Su Nantian.

Su Nantian gave a cold glance and took a step forward.

At the same time, the fierce man also punched out. Whoever it was, they would be caught first.

Su Nantian smiled slightly and punched back.

The two punches collided with a dull sound. Su Nantian remained unmoved, while the fierce man took three steps back before stopping.

The other two men were about to attack Su Nantian, but the fierce man stopped them immediately.

"May I ask your name?" The fierce man asked with a bow.

"Sū Nàntiān!" (Su Nantian)

A strange name entered their ears. They exchanged glances, unsure of who this person was.

Just as they hesitated whether to continue attacking, a fat man rushed out of the forest, waving his hands and shouting, "Mistake! Mistake! This is all a misunderstanding. We're on the same side!"

"Master Kuang!" They looked puzzled.

"This young man is one I specially invited. He's our ally. Why fight?" Kuanglong smiled and played the mediator, returning their weapons to them.

Su Nantian remained calm. He knew Kuanglong's little tricks well, even the tiny insect behind him was under his control.

"Alright, come in," they said reluctantly, watching Su Nantian with suspicion.

Kuanglong followed closely. At this moment, his inner thoughts were shaken; this young man was becoming more and more inscrutable.

Chapter 951: Arrogance

The punch he had just felt clearly showed this person hadn't used his full strength. Yet, he had sent the fierce man back three steps.

He was very clear that this man came from the Might Sect, a young prodigy whose strength wasn't something ordinary people could match. This youth had managed to send him back with a single punch, and his performance throughout the journey further confirmed Su Nantian's innate divine strength. After postnatal cultivation, such power was unsurprising.

At this moment, his heart felt delighted. The nine-tier tower's opening was always determined by various strengths.

If Su Nantian truly had immense strength, he might have opened the tower's door early on.

"Ha! Master Kuang, you've finally arrived. We've been waiting for several days here. I thought something had delayed you," one of the old men said, stepping forward from the crowd. They naturally saw the entire scene.

Though Kuanglong had brought a helper, they weren't entirely happy but couldn't show it on their faces.

"Master Xu, I'm fine," Kuanglong said with a smile. They exchanged greetings for a while.

Master Xu asked cautiously, "Master Kuang, why don't you introduce this young man to us?"

"This is a young man I met on the way. His name is Su Nantian. I specially invited him to help me," Kuanglong smiled and said to everyone.

"If he's an ally, there's no need for suspicion," Master Xu smiled and said. He looked at Su Nantian carefully but couldn't find any clues.

"Has Master Lao Niu arrived yet?" Kuanglong looked around the crowd, searching for Master Lao Niu's figure.

"Lao Niu. You know him. He's always slow, arriving late every time. His attitude is quite high, making everyone wait for him," someone said with resentment.

But they couldn't do anything. After all, Master Lao Niu was the main force in opening the tower's door.

"Ha! Ha!" Suddenly, Kuanglong laughed. "I have a candidate. I wonder if you're willing to try."

He looked at the man who was angry and said, "You mean this young man? Are you joking?"

A middle-aged man with a fierce expression stepped forward. "Wu Yun, can he do it? Let's test him."

"Then I'll see how capable this young man truly is," Wu Yun said confidently.

"Then let me see what kind of ability he has."

As soon as the words were spoken, Wu Yun's figure appeared before Su Nantian.

Su Nantian raised his eyebrows and looked at this man.

Wu Yun said proudly, "Come on. Let me see how much strength you have."

Wu Yun stood tall and his aura suddenly surged, as if he had become a mountain.

Su Nantian observed for a while and said slowly, "If you can make me take a half-step back with your attack, I'll leave immediately."

This statement caused Wu Yun to sneer. The people behind him also murmured.

It sounded like a joke, and it wasn't even funny.

"Alright. If you're seeking death, don't blame me for being ruthless," Wu Yun said without hesitation and raised his fist.

When he appeared again, it was already at Su Nantian's chest.

One punch!

Wu Yun felt as if he had punched a hard stone. His hand felt intense pain.

But the other party remained expressionless, which made Wu Yun immediately stop underestimating him and took him seriously.

This youth had some skills. He didn't want to fail in a ditch, letting everyone laugh at him. If he couldn't even defeat this young man, what face would he have returning?

Wu Yun punched again. This time, his attack was faster and more powerful, with a punch intent that carried anger and a furious roar toward Su Nantian.

Kuanglong's eyes narrowed. He hadn't expected this man to have developed a punch intent. If he remembered correctly, this set of punches had only been started half a year ago. Yet in such a short time, he had developed a punch intent.

This showed Wu Yun's talent in boxing was extraordinary, even surpassing his master. His heart felt some concern about whether Su Nantian could withstand this punch.

A gust of wind spread around the two, and Kuanglong's eyes slightly narrowed.

When the smoke cleared, their figures gradually appeared. Wu Yun's fist was stopped just one inch from Su Nantian's body.

Wu Yun silently turned around and said nothing. The crowd saw this and didn't say anything more. Wu Yun had admitted his defeat. This punch was likely the most glorious one of his life, but Su Nantian hadn't even moved a finger.

Soon, the crowd gathered in front of the first-level tower door.

"Only when strength reaches a certain level can this door be opened. Everyone must not hold back; let's try as much as we can. If we can open it early, it will benefit everyone," Kuanglong said with a smile.

Soon, various colored lights struck the first-level door. However, it remained unmoved without any signs of opening.

But when Su Nantian placed his hands on the door, a cold sensation spread to his palms. It felt like not a door but an icy world.

Su Nantian's feeling was strange; this thing didn't awaken his previous memories, but it felt very familiar.

Su Nantian slowly exerted strength. With everyone's combined effort, the door was gradually pushed open.

It opened slightly, and the crowd's expressions brightened. They increased their strength, but these magical attacks seemed to have no effect and were absorbed by the door.

This scene was familiar to them. Every time the door opened, their attacks became useless. Although the power they contributed was minimal, they all stepped forward.

Perhaps just a little more strength could open the door. But after it had opened slightly, there was no further progress. They struggled for a long time but only managed to open it slightly.

Gradually, some people cursed and others gave up.

"Stop wasting your strength. Wait for Master Lao Niu to come. How could this young man open the door with his physique?"

"Using up your strength now will make you rest for a long time later."

Some people whispered.

Kuanglong heard this and immediately cursed, "Damn it, you're standing there talking without any effort. How many benefits have you gotten from Master Lao Niu's actions?"

Su Nantian smiled coldly. He didn't mind this at all. To be honest, he hadn't fully unleashed his strength yet—only about half.

Chapter 952: Strength Brings Miracles

Kuanglong's outburst of anger eventually angered many people.

Some people left and stood at a distance, watching them waste their strength with cold smiles.

Gradually, only Su Nantian, Kuanglong, and a few others remained.

Seeing that most people had left, Su Nantian suddenly exerted his strength. The door opened at a visible speed. Everyone was stunned—why had so many people failed to move it even slightly?

They soon realized the truth: someone was deliberately concealing their strength.

But this was too exaggerated. How much strength did one need to conceal? The only person they didn't know was this new arrival, Su Nantian. Others were known; even if they gave their all, they couldn't push the door open.

If this was entirely Su Nantian's doing, they dared not imagine it. They immediately dismissed the idea.

The door was opened, but these people's eyes were fiery. Although they had left in the second half, they still wanted to enter.

"Who do you think you are?" Kuanglong immediately blocked the door and roared.

"Master Kuang, we were mistaken earlier. This door was opened by you too. Let's all go in together," one person said with a smile, trying to appease.

"You're mistaken. This door wasn't opened by me; it was opened by my companion. I'm sure you won't deny that," he said, looking at the others who had pushed the door. He knew their strength well. Even without them, Su Nantian might have opened this door alone.

"Enter if you wish. Each of you must pay a toll," Su Nantian said calmly.

"Kid, don't be too arrogant. Your toll isn't easy to get," one person shouted.

"Young master, let's talk nicely. How about this?" One old man smiled and took out a golden object, handing it to Su Nantian.

Others saw this item and their eyes widened. This old man was truly generous, giving the red jade to this youth. After all, it was a top-tier refining artifact.

It's fine.

"If I force my way in, can you stop me?" One person shouted defiantly. "Can you withstand my punch?"

Su Nantian looked at his fist and coldly said, "You can try. Can you withstand my next punch?"

Hmph!

This person sneered and rushed toward Su Nantian. He didn't believe he couldn't teach this young man a lesson. Although Wu Yun had also fought, how could his strength compare to his? Plus, he had a secret technique. With the secret method's enhancement, his strength could increase tenfold. He wouldn't be defeated by this youth.

This person's aura suddenly surged, transforming into a flame that rushed toward Su Nantian.

Su Nantian smiled and kicked this person's face. This person flew like a fireball, landing on the ground motionless and unconscious.

Everyone was stunned. They hadn't expected Su Nantian to easily defeat this person even with the secret technique. It was just one kick.

This kick was clearly seen; there were no tricks, just a simple and ordinary kick.

Kuanglong was stunned. His mouth gaped in disbelief. Although he hadn't seen Su Nantian fight yet, he had clearly seen that kick—definitely not something one could do without experiencing life-or-death battles.

This kick had directly struck the person's vital spot. Even if he didn't die, he would be crippled.

This made him even more grateful that he hadn't attacked Su Nantian earlier; otherwise, he would now be a corpse.

After collecting the toll, Su Nantian was the first to enter the door. He walked through a dark corridor and entered a bright hall. Various fierce beast carvings adorned the walls, appearing extremely fierce and formidable.

Su Nantian asked, "How do I proceed to the second level?"

Kuanglong quickly replied, "The first two levels have been largely taken by us. Only a few items remain. However, the layout changes significantly each time people enter here, so old maps are useless. To proceed to the second level, you must defeat the guardian of the first level."

Kuanglong pointed at a statue standing nearby.

Su Nantian saw this statue and immediately approached it without hesitation, delivering a punch straight at it.

The statue had just begun to move when it was pierced through the head by a single punch.

Everyone watched this and almost dropped their jaws. They had never seen such a violent way to pass through.

Even Master Lao Niu couldn't do this!

When the statue shattered, a hidden compartment slowly opened.

Su Nantian walked straight through without lingering in the first level. The only item here had already been sensed by him—extremely ordinary and useless to him.

A Dai followed closely behind Su Nantian.

The second level was much larger than the first. There were also many statues, four in total, more towering and robust than the one in the first level.

But Su Nantian didn't care. This time, when he was only a zhang away from the statue, all four statues suddenly awakened.

Eight red eyes opened and stared at Su Nantian intensely.

The eight of them rushed toward Su Nantian with fierce slashes. Su Nantian narrowed his eyes and spread his hands.

Everyone watched this and sneered. This was like seeking death—trying to block those sharp weapons with bare hands. They didn't want to help him at all, and Kuanglong was somewhat anxious. He wasn't unwilling to help; entering would mean death anyway. Each time they broke through, they had to form a formation and wander for a long time before defeating the four.

Su Nantian wanted to defeat them alone, which was obviously extremely difficult.

Suddenly, Su Nantian's hands emitted a soft white light and stably blocked the eight swords.

Pings echoed repeatedly with metal sounds.

Su Nantian's entire body radiated white light.

Numerous swords struck him, yet they showed no damage. Not even a single bloodstain appeared.

Everyone was increasingly stunned. They had never heard of any technique that could block such weapons. These sharp swords' cutting power they had already tested, and many people had died under these eight swords.

Who was this Su Nantian? How could a young man have such a body?

Su Nantian changed his stance and quickly shattered the four statues.

Chapter 953: Prophecy

When everyone saw the pile of debris, they even doubted whether these statues would exist again when the tower appeared next time.

The third-level hidden compartment slowly opened. Su Nantian didn't linger in the second level but went straight up. Some people's eyes were hot for the items that hadn't been taken yet, and they prepared their plans to break them open.

When Kuanglong followed Su Nantian into the third level, his heart was excited. There was something he had coveted for a long time but couldn't obtain. If Su Nantian helped, it would be effortless.

The third-level guardian was not a statue but a living person. Su Nantian observed for a while and realized it was merely a puppet, albeit an advanced one.

Su Nantian didn't think twice and rushed forward to smash it with brute force. However, he hadn't expected this puppet to be unusually agile; several attempts failed to touch its body.

Su Nantian smiled coldly and increased his speed. With a single "boom," the puppet turned into debris.

A Dai and Kuanglong's three people watched this and were shocked. Kuanglong's heart couldn't take it, although he had seen Su Nantian's strength before. But each time, it refreshed his worldview.

As Su Nantian prepared to head for the fourth level, Kuanglong smiled and said, "Young master, I have a request. This level has something that needs your help."

"Sure, after all, this place was brought here by you," Su Nantian said calmly. It was a normal exchange, even though this man had previously tried to trick him.

Kuanglong led Su Nantian to a red light column. Inside the column was an ancient scroll.

"This is the scroll. Legends say it records a technique that enhances physical strength," Kuanglong said, his eyes filled with longing for this technique.
