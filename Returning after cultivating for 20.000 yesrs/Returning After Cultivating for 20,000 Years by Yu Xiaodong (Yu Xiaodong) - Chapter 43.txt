Two delicate eyebrows furrowed slightly, and Cao Yun was puzzled as to whether Su Nantian was mocking her. Could it be that she didn't meet his standards? Cao Yun touched her soft, rosy cheeks and shook her head instinctively. She thought to herself: All men who know me would fawn over me, like these people. I must be fine-looking.

Cao Yun lifted her large eyes, glistening with moisture, and stared intently at Su Nantian. The man before her embodied all of Cao Yun's ideal traitsâ€”unparalleled in the world, uniquely different, and breathtakingly handsome.

She clenched her small hands on the table, thinking: I must possess him.

Although beer had a low alcohol content, for Cao Yun, the aftereffects of drinking were unbearable. To gather courage before Su Nantian, she had poured drink after drink into her cup. Yet, Su Nantian remained motionless. Her brows furrowed deeper. Cao Yun thought: Perhaps Su Nantian was naturally introverted and hesitant to express himself, so she would take the initiative.

At that moment, Cao Yun accepted the idea that had surfaced under the influence of alcohol. Her heart screamed to confess her feelings to Su Nantian.

Recalling Su Nantian's encouraging words, she had no more hesitation. The result would have to be tested. Cao Yun's desire to confess grew stronger.

Chapter 202: Harassment

After repeatedly suppressing the flickering desire within her, Cao Yun was eager to express her inner longing to Su Nantian.

"Su Nantian..." Cao Yun called softly, her face flushed. Upon hearing this, Su Nantian looked up but saw Cao Yun's drunken expression and frowned. He was about to advise her to drink less when a sudden scream echoed from the corridor.

That familiar voice caused everyone in the private room to freeze. Cao Yun widened her eyes. The alcohol had slowed her mind.

"Did I just hear Zhao Ling's voice?" Cao Yun touched her forehead, which had started to throb.

Su Nantian at the adjacent seat had already rushed out of the room. He saw Zhao Ling standing in front of another private room, furious and confronting several men.

Others only then realized the situation and rushed after Su Nantian.

In the opposing private room, Zhao Ling stood with her hands on her hips, scolding the men seated before her: "You all get out right now! We don't welcome people like you here!"

The men glanced at Zhao Ling and continued eating their meals.

Su Nantian observed the scene, frowned, and approached Zhao Ling with concern: "What's going on?"

Upon seeing Su Nantian arrive, Zhao Ling's eyes welled up but she stubbornly said: "It's nothing. I can handle it. You all go back and eat."

"Tell me what happened," Su Nantian ignored Zhao Ling's stubbornness and asked again with patience.

Cao Yun, seeing Su Nantian so concerned about Zhao Ling, felt a slight discomfort but kept it hidden. She also stood beside Zhao Ling and asked: "Zhao Ling, we're all here. Tell us what happened just now. There's nothing to fear."

Zhao Ling glared at the men eating happily and hissed: "These thugs touched me!"

Upon hearing this, Cao Yun was startled. She then shouted at the men: "You call that harassment? We can report it! Now, whoever did this, step forward and apologize!"

Cao Yun's words fell on deaf ears. The men remained silent.

Cao Yun's face turned slightly red with embarrassment.

Behind them, the six men lacked such patience. One kicked over a chair and pushed forward with his fists: "Which of these lowlifes did this? If you don't step up, do you think it's acceptable?"

The men chuckled and eyed Cao Yun with lewd glances, some even drooled, which was extremely disgusting.

"Touching one's body doesn't cost you anything," one thug stood up and said, "If that girl would sit down and have a drink with us, we might even reward you."

The men laughed heartily, their lewd expressions unhidden. They then pulled out a stack of money and threw it onto the table.

Su Nantian's face darkened instantly. Zhao Ling quickly hid behind Su Nantian.

The thug approached Zhao Ling with a sly grin, saying: "I've ordered my meal. You open the door to do business, yet you want to kick out customers?" The thug sneered at Zhao Ling and then surveyed the others in the room, shouting: "I dare you!"

The remaining thugs also showed 'brotherhood' by placing their chopsticks heavily on the table, all directing their gazes at Su Nantian's group.

Everyone shivered when stared down. However, Su Nantian calmly picked up a single chopstick from the table.

The room fell silent. Zhao Ling glared at the thugs, wanting to get up and call for help but was stopped by Su Nantian beside her.

Zhao Ling looked at Su Nantian, who gave her a reassuring glance. She bit her lip and felt calm suddenly.

The thug stood up, scanning the silent crowd with arrogance. He then sat down contentedly but reached for a chicken leg when suddenly, a chopstick "swished" into his hand.

Even with its rounded head, the chopstick had easily pierced through the thug's palm as if it were tofu. There was no hesitation.

"Ah! My hand!" The thug immediately pulled his hand back, the excruciating pain causing him to sweat and convulse. His bleeding palm trembled uncontrollably.

The atmosphere in the room turned tense, and all the thugs stood up, determined to tear Su Nantian apart.

The man was uneasy and glanced at Su Nantian.

Su Nantian slowly approached the thug leader, gripping the chopstick and gently lifting it. The thug leader gasped in pain again.

Zhao Ling was touched by Su Nantian's actions for her. Seeing the impending bloodshed, she instinctively closed her eyes.

Although the thug leader was in severe pain, he dared not move for fear Su Nantian would repeat the action.

"Relax," Su Nantian's calm gaze seemed casual as he withdrew the chopstick. "I specifically avoided your tendons and bones."

Upon seeing Su Nantian's hand loosen, the thug quickly hid his hand behind him and shouted to his companions: "Call the police! Damn it, today I won't let this restaurant die!"

"Go ahead, Wang Dapan," a younger man behind Wang Dapan immediately pulled out his phone from his pants pocket but hadn't even dialed the number when Su Nantian swiftly snatched it away.

Wang Dapan looked at Su Nantian's movements, his eyes flickering.

"Who's in a hurry? I'll do it for you later. Right now, the one who harassed Zhao Ling is your hand," Su Nantian tossed the phone to the Gao brothers and pointed at Wang Dapan's hand hidden behind him.

Wang Dapan's heart dropped. He still stubbornly said: "Don't talk nonsense. You hurt me and stole my phone. This is a black shop!"

Chapter 203: Discipline

"Black shop?" Zhao Ling was enraged again. She stepped forward and surveyed them, saying: "Don't you look at your own appearance? This mouth full of gold teeth! How dare you call us a black shop!"

After being lectured by Zhao Ling, Wang Dapan's face darkened further. He instinctively licked his gold teeth and sneered: "What? You're judging by appearance, shallow! Do you write 'black shop' on the door?"

"Kid, it was your move first. Who knows who will help you,"

Wang Dapan raised his injured hand.

"Stop talking nonsense. Apologize now, or none of you will leave here," Su Nantian said.

The group of thugs hadn't seen Su Nantian's abilities before and didn't take him seriously, thinking he had just been lucky. How could they fear a few young men?

"Did you hear that? He says we can't leave,"

"Hahahaha, I tell you today. If you don't pay, we won't leave!"

"Have you heard of 'it's easy to bring a Buddha but hard to send it away'? Today, let you see!"

The two girls were so angry they turned red-faced.

Wang Dapan, holding his slightly better hand, leered at Cao Yun and Zhao Ling's faces.

"Of course, there's a simple way to solve this," Wang Dapan said: "Let these two girls stay with us for the night. You also pay us some money, and we won't bother you."

Before he finished speaking, Song Jin spat in Wang Dapan's face: "Spit! You're despicable!"

The two girls were both angry and ashamed. Cao Yun's large eyes welled up with moisture.

Su Nantian narrowed his eyes and asked: "At first, it was just to apologize. Why make it so complicated?"

Wang Dapan didn't understand Su Nantian's words, thinking he was afraid. So Wang Dapan ignored his injured hand and extended his healthy one to Zhao Ling, raising three fingers.

"What does that mean?" Zhao Ling asked.

"Hey, our boss means you need to pay three thousand yuan," a thug behind Wang Dapan said proudly.

This made Zhao Ling's face flush red and pale. Seeing her silence, Wang Dapan urged: "You hurt me, three thousand is cheap for you."

Saying that, Wang Dapan reached out to grab Cao Yun. She was startled and quickly hid behind Su Nantian.

Wang Dapan's face changed, "Come over now. If you don't listen, you'll have to pay me thirty thousand!"

Everyone inhaled sharply. Wang Dapan, seeing the effect of his intimidation, waved three fingers: "Thirty thousand... Ah!"

Unfortunately, those three fingers were snapped by Su Nantian. The clear sound made everyone's heart tremble, and they instinctively checked their hands.

Wang Dapan could no longer speak due to the pain. Holding his injured hand, he shook uncontrollably for a long time before saying: "Give me! Kill him! Kill him! Oh my hand!"

Initially stunned by Su Nantian's actions, the thugs were driven to action by Wang Dapan's curses and rushed forward.

Su Nantian wanted to discipline them, seeing they all came one after another. He thought of the group behind him, especially Cao Yun and Zhao Ling, and continuously retreated to escort them into the opposite private room.

Everyone thought Su Nantian was afraid. The thugs' arrogance grew more intense, although Su Nantian had performed well in class.

Although the rumors were strong, they hadn't seen it with their own eyes. These fierce men weren't comparable to Shen Fei's weak body.

Even if Su Nantian was so skilled, he couldn't be a match for these men!

Song Jin had initially wanted to go call for help but was pushed back by Su Nantian, blocking the entrance. The thugs also stood in the corridor. Song Jin sighed and felt worried.

Zhao Ling was frightened by this scene. Before, when she was beside Su Nantian, she didn't know why but felt infinite courage. But now that even Su Nantian had retreated here, Zhao Ling's eyes were red as she tugged at Su Nantian's sleeve and choked: "I'm sorry... It's my fault..."

Hearing Zhao Ling's words, Cao Yun felt a pang in her heart and quickly embraced Zhao Ling's shoulder to comfort: "Don't be afraid. Su Nantian must have his reasons. When the noise downstairs gets loud, there will be reinforcements."

Zhao Ling blinked her teary eyes and tightly clung to Cao Yun's arm.

The frontmost Su Nantian didn't care about the thoughts of those behind him. If he knew his protective actions were mistaken for fear, Su Nantian would have grimaced and turned black.

After confirming those behind were absolutely safe, Su Nantian stepped forward from the door.

The previously arrogant thugs felt a little drumming in their hearts upon seeing Su Nantian change. But they soon laughed: "One person fighting so many people, is he looking for death or a fool?"

One thug stepped forward with a smiling fist but at an extremely tricky angle.

"Too slow," Su Nantian coldly said, his tone like a winter's chill that made the opponent shiver.

That man approached Su Nantian closer. In others' eyes, it was a blink of an eye, but to Su Nantian, it was like a snail.

"Ah!" A scream.

That man flew out like a kite, crashing against the wall and groaning before passing out.

Everyone was shocked. Su Nantian maintained a half-raised left leg posture.

The action was lightning fast, no one could see Su Nantian's move clearly. The thug had already flown out, making the opposing thugs nervous.

But due to face, they finally roared and rushed at Su Nantian.

One thug swung a fist at Su Nantian's face, another kicked his side.

Su Nantian curled one corner of his lips and stepped aside to easily dodge the punch and kick.

That flying leg landed heavily on another man's stomach, while the fierce fist fell into empty space.

Within less than thirty seconds, those previously arrogant thugs now lay like lost dogs on the ground, some still convulsing.

Chapter 204: Begging for Mercy

The brief clattering sound upstairs completely startled the people downstairs. The service staff calmed down the frightened guests below and several chefs directly grabbed knives to go upstairs.

The chefs remembered Zhao Ling was still on the second floor and hurried their steps.

When these chefs arrived, they were shocked by what they saw.

The corridor was full of people sprawled in various positions. Their eyes searched the crowd until they found Zhao Ling, stunned at the entrance.

"Lingling, are you okay?" The chefs rushed over and asked with gentle concern. Zhao Ling snapped back to reality and shook her head: "I... I'm fine, don't worry about me."

The chefs examined Zhao Ling from head to toe and found she had no injuries, so they sighed in relief. But thinking about the unconscious people in the corridor, they asked: "What happened?"

Zhao Ling glanced at those lying down and briefly explained the situation to the chefs.

The chefs were shocked by Su Nantian's strength. After recovering, they glared at the thugs with rising anger.

"Wow, Su Nantian is so strong!" He Tao said in admiration and wanted to run toward Su Nantian but stopped upon recalling Su Nantian's might.

Su Nantian ignored it all, calmly flexing his fingers and preparing to enter the opposite private room to deal with Wang Dapan.

Wang Dapan stumbled out from a corner, his hands now useless. He had seen the fight outside clearly. If he knew this young man was so strong, he would never have provoked him. Now he had no thoughts of revenge but only one idea: to live and escape from here.

His nose and eyebrows were twisted in fear, looking at Su Nantian walking in like a mouse seeing a cat. He almost wet himself.

Su Nantian raised an eyebrow and said: "Perfect, it's convenient."

Wang Dapan shivered and fell to his knees, repeatedly bowing with his head hitting the floor with a heavy sound.

Su Nantian raised an eyebrow again, stepping back to give Wang Dapan some space to perform.

Wang Dapan saw Su Nantian step back but moved his knees forward toward Su Nantian.

His ugly face was twisted with fear, and his gold teeth were exposed. Wang Dapan cried out: "Brother, brother! I was blind! I didn't recognize your greatness."

"Are you worthy to call me 'brother'?" Song Jin coldly scolded. He had wanted to teach this bastard a lesson since before, not knowing how many innocent girls he had harmed. He was truly a scoundrel and a disgrace to society.

Wang Dapan first looked shocked, then clung to Song Jin's legs: "Master! Master! I was blind and looked down on you! It's all my fault! Please, master, spare my life!"

Wang Dapan trembled, his mouth stammering as he bowed to everyone. His voice kept repeating "master."

He looked like a dog, a tail-wagging beggar.

Seeing the unconscious people on the ground, he doubted if they were already dead. His fear intensified.

Thinking about this, Wang Dapan's body shook more violently, and he took several deep breaths to catch his breath.

Su Nantian wanted to tease him but feared Wang Dapan couldn't withstand it and would urinate there. So Su Nantian also stopped his game, crouched down, and patted Wang Dapan's face: "I asked you to apologize from the beginning. If you had apologized early, why would this have happened?"

Wang Dapan suddenly remembered that today's incident was because he had flirted with Zhao Ling, causing this unexpected disaster.

At that moment, Wang Dapan understood Su Nantian's implied meaning and immediately moved his knees forward. He cried while bowing to Zhao Ling, repeatedly saying: "Madam, it was my mistake! Please spare me!"

Zhao Ling was startled when Wang Dapan approached and wanted to step back, but she was pushed forward by Song Jin.

Now Wang Dapan bowed like a funeral procession to Zhao Ling, which made Zhao Ling uncomfortable.

Zhao Ling cast a nervous glance at Su Nantian.

Su Nantian understood and said: "Come here."

Wang Dapan immediately crawled over like a dog. Su Nantian stood up and coldly asked: "Do you want to settle this privately or do I need to call the police?"

Without hesitation, Wang Dapan cried: "Please call the police! Please!"

Wang Dapan knew that if he was caught by the police, his harassment crime wouldn't keep him long. He might just be scolded and released. But if he was caught by Su Nantian...

He looked at his weak, lifeless hands and chose to beg Su Nantian to call the police without hesitation.

Everyone was amused. Who had ever seen a thug beg someone to call the police?

Gao Da'an excitedly said: "Following Su Nantian, it's different. I've never seen this before."

Everyone laughed again. Cao Yun's eyes flickered, looking at Su Nantian with even more intensity. Beside her, Zhao Ling also looked at Su Nantian with red eyes, full of gratitude and admiration. The two girls' gazes seemed to have no one else.

Su Nantian, after confirming Wang Dapan's intention, took out his phone and dialed Feng Yue's number from the contact list.

Su Nantian naturally knew Wang Dapan's thoughts. Harassment was indeed not enough to keep him in jail for days. When Wang Dapan came out, he would just be recovering at the patrol team. But Su Nantian couldn't protect Zhao Ling all the time. If Wang Dapan came out and didn't learn a lesson, he might cause trouble again.

So this person must be someone familiar. Patrol team's Feng Yue was the best choice.

Su Nantian dialed the number and held the phone to his ear, listening to the "beep" sound. Everyone kept quiet, watching Su Nantian make the call.

Soon, the phone was answered. Obviously, Feng Yue had stored Su Nantian's number.

Feng Yue asked hurriedly: "What happened? What's going on?"

"I'm at a street restaurant in Jixiang Street. Someone is causing trouble here. Come take them away."

The other end of the phone, Feng Yue frowned. A street restaurant could have what kind of trouble? And Su Nantian was there, no matter what the issue would have been resolved. Calling Feng Yue now probably meant to find someone to clean up the mess.

Although he was reluctant, Feng Yue still agreed: "Okay, I understand. I'll come over."

After hanging up the phone, Zhang Xue just brought a cup of coffee and saw Feng Yue's smelly face. She asked: "What's wrong?"

Feng Yue was deep in thought, not knowing who the person was. He replied: "Su Nantian is at Jixiang Street, tell me to come over."

Chapter 205: Arrest

After Feng Yue said it, he regretted it. But the situation was too late.

Zhang Xue narrowed her eyes and placed the freshly brewed coffee on the table, saying to Feng Yue: "I'm going with you."

Feng Yue knew Zhang Xue's intention to deal with Su Nantian was not a day or two. Since that incident, Zhang Xue had focused most of her energy on Su Nantian.

Although Zhang Xue claimed to be eliminating evil, Feng Yue knew deep down that Zhang Xue had developed some inappropriate feelings and thoughts toward Su Nantian.

"Don't need you to go. It's a small matter," Feng Yue's face lengthened. Zhang Xue, however, was indifferent and resisted: "Then you don't take me, I'll drive myself."

Saying that, Zhang Xue reached for the gun holster on the wall. Feng Yue quickly stopped her: "No... no, I'll take you."

Not long after, five patrol team cars with lights flashed off.

...

In the restaurant, Su Nantian had already let five boys tie up those lying on the ground and Wang Dapan kneeling. To make it easier to tie ropes, Cao Yun poured cold water on the faces of the unconscious thugs. They instantly woke up but still couldn't stand, hugging their bodies and crying in pain.

Su Nantian calmly sipped tea and said slowly: "Get up yourself or should I help you?"

This statement was like a thunderclap. All the people on the ground, whether in real pain or fake, stood up with their bodies and let those five boys tie them.

"Wa," Zhao Ling sat across from Su Nantian, supporting her chin with both hands. Her eyes sparkled as she stared at Su Nantian: "Big Brother Su, you're so handsome." She waved her hands and continued: "When you fought them earlier, it was also so handsome. Now sitting here sipping tea, still so handsome. Hehe."

After the incident, Cao Yun's drunkenness had completely faded. She sat beside Su Nantian and gently poured tea into his cup.

"Thank you for helping us earlier. If it weren't for you, we might have been injured," Cao Yun said.

Su Nantian didn't respond but placed the empty cup on the table. He Tao, panting after tying up the last person, envied Su Nantian: "Su Nantian, look at how you have two girls by your side. It's too extravagant."

Cao Yun, who was pouring tea for Su Nantian, suddenly stopped and her face turned red.

"I think you're too idle. Think about the afternoon match instead," Song Jin patted his hands' dust and came over to elbow He Tao.

He Tao immediately waved his hands: "Hey, didn't you see? Su Nantian's moves were so amazing. What is the afternoon match?"

Everyone knew Su Nantian disliked such flattery and simply ignored He Tao's provocation. He Tao got no response and sat down to drink tea unhappily.

Checking the time, it had been fifteen minutes. Cao Yun said: "Why is the patrol team so slow? They haven't arrived yet."

...

In the patrol car, Feng Yue was driving the lead vehicle. Zhang Xue sat in the front passenger seat.

Feng Yue was troubled now. This Zhang Xue would definitely find trouble with Su Nantian. He was thinking about how to deal with it.

He intentionally slowed down the car's speed and didn't use his privileges at the traffic lights.

Zhang Xue frowned, urging every few minutes: "Drive faster. If not, I'll drive."

Feng Yue's face changed.

He then increased the speed to normal and arrived at the street restaurant in Jixiang Street three minutes later.

Zhang Xue saw this restaurant and her eyes lit up. Feng Yue's face darkened further. Others watching Feng Yue felt a sense of fear.

Several patrol teams entered the crowded restaurant with great noise.

The diners on the first floor were stunned, their chopsticks holding meat trembling.

A chef who had been waiting downstairs for the patrol team arranged by Zhao Ling immediately smiled and approached respectfully: "You're tired. Please, go upstairs."

Zhang Xue's mouth twitched. It was as if they were coming to eat, not to arrest people.

Feng Yue also saw the ordinary people staring at them and growled: "What are you looking at? Patrol team is arresting people. Eat quickly!"

The diners were startled and immediately lowered their heads to eat, not daring to look around.

Zhang Xue's heart beat faster as she went upstairs. She felt a sense of something breaking out but ignored it deliberately.

On the second floor, Su Nantian and his group were quietly sipping tea. Hearing the noisy footsteps in the stairwell, Su Nantian knew it was definitely the patrol team.

Song Jin guarding the stairs saw the patrol team and shouted to Su Nantian in the private room: "They finally came. It seems we can go back to school soon."

Feng Yue and Zhang Xue led several patrol team members up the stairs. They were shocked by the tied-up people.

Six people sat on the ground, their faces and bodies injured. The worst one had a chopstick pierced through his palm, with three fingers deformed. But these people clearly dressed like thugs. Now their hands were tied behind them, sitting in a circle.

Zhang Xue twitched her mouth again and bluntly asked Su Nantian: "Su Nantian, come out. Explain to me who started this trouble!"

Upon hearing the familiar voice, Su Nantian was also surprised. He never expected Zhang Xue to come. At that moment, Su Nantian put down his tea cup and walked out.

Zhang Xue hadn't seen Su Nantian for a long time. Today, seeing him again, her face felt hot.

"They started it. But they couldn't beat me and were tied up," Su Nantian patiently explained to Zhang Xue.

"They started it? I don't believe it, looking at their pitiful state!" Zhang Xue knew these people were thugs who started trouble. But she didn't know why, she wanted to argue with Su Nantian and make it more intense.

Someone was happy while others were not. Feng Yue counted the people, looked up at Su Nantian arguing with Zhang Xue and his face changed. He hurried over to greet Su Nantian: "We met again. I will definitely watch them closely."

Su Nantian also had this intention, so he continued with Feng Yue's words: "I can't be here all the time. Today, these thugs have offended me thoroughly. If you don't watch them closely, I'm afraid they'll cause trouble again after coming out."

Chapter 206: Stop

Feng Yue understood and nodded, preparing to take the people away.

Wang Dapan saw their conversation and the polite manner of patrol team leader Feng Yue.

He had a bad feeling, more certain of one thing: Su Nantian had someone in the patrol team. Not just anyone, he wanted to cry.

Looking at Su Nantian and then Feng Yue, his mind wavered. His legs felt weak with no strength. Thinking about the dark days ahead, he regretted it.

He didn't know how many years he would have to stay.

Seeing the patrol team people coming to take him away, he clung to the stair railing and shook his head fiercely: "I won't go!"

Feng Yue, already annoyed by Zhang Xue and Su Nantian's argument, heard the thug wouldn't leave. His anger increased: "Won't go? Where do you plan to go?"

Wang Dapan looked at his unconscious brothers. Although he was reluctant, he thought it was the wisest choice to leave with the patrol team.

His small eyes darted, thinking: How could he find a perfect plan?

Wang Dapan's eyes lit up and shouted: "I'm an injured person. Look at my hand. I demand to go to the hospital first! Otherwise, if my hand becomes useless, I'll sue you for not treating me."

His left hand was in a very exaggerated position, making people feel horrified.

At this moment, the three fingers were twisted in a strange way.

The other hand was trembling and raised by Wang Dapan, although the blood had stopped, the chopstick still remained in it, which was shocking.

"You have such a minor injury. I saw it when I counted you earlier. It's not a big operation. The patrol team has doctors who can treat it! You won't be disabled," Feng Yue said dismissively and ordered the team to take them away.

It was annoying to hear this nonsense. Quickly leave here, Zhang Xue could be apart from Su Nantian.

Zhang Xue had thought this time she couldn't defeat Su Nantian again, feeling a bit sad. Her eyes focused on Wang Dapan's injury, not knowing what she was thinking.

Suddenly her eyes lit up and she rushed to stop Feng Yue's group: "Stop!"

Zhang Xue hurriedly approached Wang Dapan, grabbed his arm and carefully examined the hand that looked like it would be useless. Then she pulled out her identification card from her pocket and said to Su Nantian: "Now I suspect you have intentionally injured someone. You need to come with us for investigation."

This statement made Su Nantian stunned, Feng Yue was shocked, and even Wang Dapan's expression was strange.

This Su Nantian wasn't acquainted with the team leader, why would he need to take him back?

Who was this woman?

If Su Nantian was also taken back, he would have no good outcome.

At that moment, Wang Dapan immediately struggled out of the crowd and cried: "I didn't! It's not my intention!"

This cry made everyone snap back to their senses. Zhang Xue comforted Wang Dapan by patting his shoulder: "Don't be afraid. Since you're so injured, we will definitely catch the person who hurt you and give you an explanation."

Feng Yue frowned and glanced at Su Nantian, who had no angry expression. He then smiled apologetically to Su Nantian and said: "Don't mess with me. Su Nantian was acting in self-defense, where is the intentional injury? I think this scoundrel wanted to harm Su Nantian!"

This made Zhang Xue even more angry. She thought if she missed this chance, it would be harder to teach Su Nantian a lesson. Zhang Xue gripped Wang Dapan's hand tightly, making him bend over in pain.

Zhang Xue was surprised and opened her mouth. She relaxed the pressure slightly but still firmly said to Feng Yue: "Although Su Nantian was dealing with the trouble, he also had to take responsibility for injuring people!"

Feng Yue was angry but helpless.

Su Nantian walked over and stood before the three people, like a formidable wall that blocked everyone's view.

Wang Dapan thought Su Nantian was coming to trouble him. His legs trembled and he struggled out of Zhang Xue's grip, quickly returning to the patrol team members' back.
