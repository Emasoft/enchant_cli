Su Nantian answered without hesitation.

"That’s great, Nantian. I beg you, save my grandfather. I’ll do anything you ask." Upon hearing Su Nantian’s resolute and unhesitating reply, Lin Suyun felt a surge of joy and immediately dropped to her knees.

"Su Nantian, what are you doing? Rise quickly. Do we need to be so formal between us?" Su Nantian hurried forward and helped Lin Suyun up.

"Thank you, Nantian."

Lin Suyun suddenly embraced Su Nantian, whispering her gratitude into his ear.

A moment later, Lin Suyun realized she was clinging to Su Nantian’s neck and immediately let go. Her pale, delicate face flushed with two streaks of red as she lowered her head like a child who had done something wrong, fingers nervously twirling her hair.

"We should leave now." She spoke with her head down, avoiding his gaze. Turning on her heel, she retreated into the room.

Su Nantian watched Lin Suyun’s retreating figure, a faint smile playing on his lips.

Moments later, Lin Suyun emerged from the room wearing a淡蓝色连衣裙 (light blue dress), her long legs wrapped in flesh-colored stockings, making the onlookers gasp.

"Let’s go."

……

On the way, Lin Suyun received a call—more accurately, an ominous message. Her grandfather had once again fallen into a coma.

Hearing this news, Lin Suyun’s tears spilled uncontrollably.

"Rest assured, I will cure your grandfather." Su Nantian silently wiped the tears from her eyes.

But soon, the car stopped—without reaching the Lin family estate. A severe accident had occurred ahead and was still being processed, making it impossible to move for the time being.

"What should we do now, Nantian?" Lin Suyun’s face was etched with anxiety. She pressed the horn several times before looking to Su Nantian for help.

This was a main road with no alternative routes.

"Don’t worry, I’m here." Su Nantian studied the map on his phone. From the map’s perspective, the nearest route to the Lin family estate was separated by a mountain.

At that moment, Su Nantian had an idea.

"I’ll carry you across."

Su Nantian looked at Lin Suyun with a serious expression.

"Are you joking at a time like this?"

Lin Suyun, hearing this, felt even more anxious.

"I’m not joking."

Without waiting for her response, Su Nantian lifted her supple body in his arms.

"Clasp onto me tightly."

Before the words had finished, the car was empty. Lin Suyun stared in disbelief at the scenery flashing past her, clutching Su Nantian’s neck tightly.

Feeling his powerful heartbeat, her restless heart immediately calmed down.

Su Nantian quickly scaled the mountain and spotted Lin’s villa. He suddenly looked up at the sky.

Drone! Danger!

The next moment, a deafening explosion rocked the spot where Su Nantian stood. Lin Suyun let out a scream.

"It’s fine, it won’t harm me."

Before Lin Suyun could speak, she felt a sudden increase in speed. Bullets whizzed past her, and trees were blown apart.

This was definitely a death sentence!

Had something happened to the Lin family?

Su Nantian changed his footwork, using his self-created "Cloud Shadow Step."

"Cloud shadows appear; one's presence becomes elusive."

Su Nantian was confident he could withstand these bullets, but the person in his arms was not. After employing the "Cloud Shadow Step," the drones could no longer accurately locate him, as they couldn’t detect his presence. Even at 100 times slower speed, only a shadow remained.

Chapter 14: Entering the Mansion

Soon, they were approaching the back mountain of Lin’s villa. Suddenly, over a dozen black-clad men emerged from the surrounding woods and surrounded them, their gun muzzles directly aimed at both.

Su Nantian halted, shielding Lin Suyun behind him and gazing coldly at the surrounding figures.

Lin Suyun tightly gripped Su Nantian’s arm, her body trembling. Why were there so many black-clad men around the Lin family? These people clearly came to kill them.

Could it be...

At this thought, Lin Suyun nearly fainted—this was what she dreaded most.

Su Nantian wasn’t worried about himself but feared any harm to Lin Suyun, even the slightest.

A brief silence fell between them.

The leader of the black-clad men narrowed his eyes. He had witnessed this moment and was deeply shocked, questioning if he could have done the same. However, now there was still a chance.

At such close proximity and with so many guns, where could he run?

Thinking this, the black-clad man regained his confidence.

The leader raised his arm and made a gesture.

Although

Fire erupted from the gun muzzles, shooting toward them.

Su Nantian lifted Lin Suyun and activated the "Cloud Shadow Step" to its fullest, though it only had one percent of its power in the immortal realm.

After a single breath,

All the black-clad men were thrown dozens of meters away, already lifeless without a single scream.

The leader was even crushed under Su Nantian’s foot, still barely alive with a look of terror in his eyes.

But it was too late to retreat. Taking others’ money means fulfilling the duty, and while people could die, the rules of the path must not be broken.

Lin Suyun was about to ask for confirmation of her suspicions when the man died.

"Indeed decisive. He bit into the pill in his mouth and died." Su Nantian spoke coldly.

"Be careful!"

Su Nantian lifted Lin Suyun and rolled to the side. A bullet narrowly missed her.

In an instant, Su Nantian vanished from his original spot and reappeared behind the hidden assassin.

Bang.

The bullet embedded itself in Su Nantian’s body and fell to the ground.

The assassin looked terrified, as if seeing a ghost. He had never encountered such a terrifying person before.

"This power is too weak, it doesn’t even tickle. It’s better than a mosquito bite." Su Nantian coldly looked at the assassin, who was now kneeling on the ground.

"Please don’t kill me. Please don’t kill me. I can give you any amount of money, just beg you."

The assassin was now kneeling and repeatedly bowing his head, blood already flowing from his forehead.

"Who sent you?" Su Nantian looked down at him.

"I really don’t know. I only knew the mission—capture or kill Lin Suyun. I truly know nothing..." The black-clad man had already bled all over his face.

"Hmph, a waste of integrity." With that, he kicked him...

"Su Nantian, it’s all right. I’m here." Su Nantian held Lin Suyun, who was trembling in his arms.

Soon, the two arrived at the front of Lin’s villa. Before entering, someone stepped out from inside.

"Suyun, you’ve finally returned."

"Grandfather, how is he?" Lin Suyun urgently asked.

"Wang Doctor is still treating him. Currently, it’s unclear. Who is this?" A middle-aged man looked at Su Nantian with a cold glint in his eye.

"Uncle, this is my friend Su Nantian." Lin Suyun held Su Nantian’s arm.

"Uncle, hello." Su Nantian extended his hand.

"I’m Lin Yulong. Young man, you’re quite good." Lin Yulong also extended his hand and used all his strength to give Su Nantian a test. However, he was shocked internally.

The other’s hand felt like a mountain and could not be moved at all. His own hand also hurt slightly, so the last sentence was spoken one word at a time.

In fact, Su Nantian had already noticed Lin Yulong’s surprise when he opened the door. However, it was well hidden and fleeting, but Su Nantian still caught it. The incident earlier definitely had something to do with him.

They separated their hands.

"You’re also quite good." Su Nantian coldly looked at Lin Yulong’s face.

Lin Yulong felt a shock, as if he had been seen through. He immediately avoided Su Nantian’s gaze and spoke to Lin Suyun.

"Suyun, go in quickly. They’ve been waiting anxiously."

As Su Nantian was about to enter, Lin Yulong immediately blocked his way.

"This is our family’s affair. You don’t need to come in."

Lin Yulong looked at Su Nantian with deep meaning. He was now very suspicious that this boy had ruined his plans.

"This is a very good friend of mine."

Lin Suyun was somewhat angry but still polite.

After saying that, she pulled Su Nantian’s hand and walked in.

Lin Yulong was stunned speechless.

On the second floor, as they just stepped onto it, a voice rang out.

"Little sister, you’ve finally returned."

A young man with a smile approached to give Lin Suyun a hug.

"Brother, don’t be so loud."

"Who is this?" The young man looked at Su Nantian, who was holding Lin Suyun’s hand, and asked in surprise.

"I’m Su Nantian. I am a friend of Suyun’s."

"I’m Lin Qi, Suyun’s cousin."

Lin Qi had a look of disdain on his face. Holding hands and calling him a friend—who would believe that!

"How is Grandfather?" Lin Suyun asked urgently.

"Grandfather might not be able to recover."

Lin Qi said this while wiping his eyes, though there were no tears.

Su Nantian watched all of this and silently laughed.

"Ah, how could it be like that."

Hearing the news, she felt weak in her legs and leaned against Su Nantian’s chest. Her tears could not be stopped.

"Yun'er, Grandfather will be fine. The doctors have not come out yet. Don’t listen to Lin Qi’s nonsense."

A woman dressed elegantly and looking well-preserved approached and comforted her.

"Mother."

Lin Suyun turned around and rushed into Bai Yajie’s arms.

Bai Yajie was also shocked. She knew her daughter best, and when had she ever held hands with a boy? And now she was crying in someone else’s arms. She could no longer understand her daughter.

Perhaps this was her new boyfriend.

Thinking of that, she asked: "Which young master is this? He looks quite handsome."

"This is a friend of mine."

Lin Suyun said and lowered her head. Her pale face was now flushed with a few red streaks.

"Madam, hello. I am Su Nantian."

"Oh, why have I never heard of him before?"

"Mother." Lin Suyun playfully scolded.

"I am just a high school classmate of Suyun’s. It has been a long time since we last met, so she didn’t mention it to you."

"That’s understandable. Suyun has a bad temper, and I hope Mr. Su will take good care of her."

Bai Yajie looked at her daughter, who was constantly giving her a meaningful glance.

Chapter 15: Healing

"Where is Father? Why isn’t he here?" Lin Suyun looked around the hall and did not see her father, so she asked Bai Yajie.

"Your father has some business at the company and is on his way here."

While they were speaking, the door inside opened.

Doctor Wang and several other doctors walked out with grim faces. Everyone else looked at them.

"How is Grandfather?"

Bai Yajie hurriedly approached to ask. Seeing the doctors’ furrowed brows and grim expressions, her anxiety deepened.

"Miss Lin, Mr. Lin. Grandfather recently caught a cold and his body was weak, which triggered this coma. This has worsened his condition again."

"Unfortunately, a blood clot in the heart has detached and blocked the brain’s vessels. Although we have implemented the most optimal and comprehensive treatment for cerebral infarction, there has been no improvement so far."

Wang Chengli adjusted his glasses and said after a moment of thought.

"Doctor Wang, I know you have done your best. Don’t be too self-critical."

Wang Chengli looked at Lin Yulong and continued: "You know his condition well. It was a miracle he regained consciousness after the previous stroke. This time, he may not wake up at all. Even if he does, he will be bedridden for the rest of his life."

"No, this isn’t true."

Lin Suyun heard this devastating news and nearly fainted.

Her parents were always busy with work, leaving no time to care for her. She was very close to Grandfather. Hearing that he might not wake up, she immediately broke down.

But then she seemed to recall something and suddenly regained her composure. She grabbed Su Nantian’s hand.

"Nantian, save my grandfather. Save my grandfather."

Lin Suyun's eyes were red and swollen.

"This is absurd. How can a young boy treat such an illness? The top experts in the country are here and have failed. What can he do?"

Lin Yulong looked at Su Nantian with disdain.

Although he didn’t know if the boy had real skills, he could not allow him to try. Even a one percent chance was unacceptable.

"Dear sister, accept reality. Grandfather is already beyond help. Let him go with less suffering."

Lin Qi spoke comfortingly, but his eyes flashed a hint of excitement. This did not escape Su Nantian’s gaze.

"Su Nantian, you said this too early. You haven’t even seen the patient’s condition yet and already claim to be able to cure him. That's too overconfident."

"Lin’s condition is now stable under our treatment. Although he hasn’t woken up, he has already escaped the danger of death. If this young man is allowed to treat him now and something goes wrong, we cannot be responsible for it."

Doctor Wang immediately spoke up. He was worried that a young boy would treat Grandfather and if he killed him, who would be responsible.

Su Nantian coldly looked at these so-called experts. He knew they had all been bought by Lin Yuhu, and the two of them were working together to ensure Grandfather died as soon as possible.

At this moment, Lin Yuhu arrived from the company and hurriedly went upstairs.

"Cough! Cough! What are you all arguing about? How is Grandfather’s condition?"

The one who hurriedly arrived was a middle-aged man with an imposing presence, slightly plump.

"Father, Grandfather is almost dead."

"What?"

Lin Suyun quickly and succinctly told Lin Yuhu what had happened. She knew her father doted on her and would believe what she said.

After hearing this, Lin Yuhu furrowed his brows.

"Young man, are you really sure you can cure Suyun’s grandfather?"

"Uncle Lin, do you have a long-standing illness in your lungs?" Su Nantian did not answer Lin Yuhu’s question but asked him one instead.

"Yes, I was injured years ago."

Lin Yuhu did not think this was anything special. Anyone could see it.

"I can cure it."

"Young man, it's better to make a decision after seeing the situation. This old illness has been treated by all the famous doctors in the country, both traditional and Western medicine. They have all failed."

"Can I try?"

Su Nantian did not say anything else, as the results would prove everything.

Lin Yuhu nodded.

Su Nantian approached and felt Lin Yuhu’s pulse for a while, then lifted his chest clothes.

He took out the silver needles he carried and inserted them into the right lower side of his chest.

Su Nantian closed his eyes, channeling his internal energy through the silver needles into the chest cavity to slowly repair some of the damaged tissues. After a while, he did the same at another location.

After ten minutes, Su Nantian opened his eyes.

"It’s done."

Su Nantian spoke calmly.

Lin Yuhu, as if not believing it, took several deep breaths. The feeling of blockage in his breathing had disappeared. His eyes were full of disbelief. Just ten minutes with a few needles and it was all fixed.

He realized he had underestimated this young man.

Lin Yuhu smiled and re-evaluated the young man.

"Little brother, who is your teacher for this miraculous medical skill?"

"Master has been living in the mountains for a long time and is tired of worldly life. He doesn’t want to reveal himself to the world, so please forgive me."

Su Nantian gave a casual excuse.

"Then, little brother, Grandfather is now in your hands."

"No, I don’t agree."

Lin Yulong watched this and was surprised. This boy actually had some skills. If he really cured Grandfather, his plan would be ruined.

"Brother, this is the only hope now. If we don’t try, how will we know the result? I believe in him. I’ll take responsibility for everything."

Lin Yuhu spoke firmly.

Hmph!

Lin Yuhu let out a cold snort and did not argue further. He looked at his son Lin Qi and gave him a meaningful glance.

Lin Yuhu then gave another person a meaningful glance, who immediately left.

Lin Yulong looked at Su Nantian’s back with a look of cruelty in his eyes, wishing he could kill him immediately. He had ruined my plans again.

If Grandfather wasn’t cured, it would be fine. But if he was, you’ll just have to wait.

"I can go in alone. You all stay outside."

Su Nantian looked at everyone and spoke calmly.

"Hmph, I wonder how you’ll get out of this."

Chapter 16: Seven Star Revival

Lin Yulong let out a cold snort.

"No, we also need to go in. Since you are so confident, why don’t you let us in? Are you afraid?"

Doctor Wang saw Su Nantian’s attitude and felt like something was stuck in his chest, very uncomfortable.

"Yes, Mr. Su, we also want to see your medical skills."

"Lin’s condition is not comparable to that hidden illness."

"We can help if there are any emergencies."

The other doctors behind Doctor Wang agreed.

"You can watch, but you better control your mouths and hands." Su Nantian coldly looked at them and spoke.

"That’s certain. Today I’ll open my eyes."

Doctor Wang said with a deliberate tone.

Inside the room.

An old man lay on the bed, eyes closed. An oxygen mask was on his nose, and intravenous fluids were being administered to treat cerebral infarction.

Su Nantian sat by the bed and removed the IV line.

"You..."

Doctor Wang saw Su Nantian’s action and wanted to scold him, but seeing a pair of icy eyes, he swallowed his words.

Su Nantian placed three fingers on Grandfather’s wrist and closed his eyes, silently sensing.

The pulse was weak and fluctuating, barely perceptible.

He felt slightly surprised. This seemed like poisoning. He followed the meridians and sensed a blockage in the brain.

It must be poisoning that caused another cerebral infarction.

Su Nantian looked at Doctor Wang and Lin Yulong, then continued to sense the pulse.

Hmph. Pretending so well, how long can you keep it up?

Can traditional Chinese medicine cure this disease? Modern medicine has failed. How could a few herbal remedies do it?

It's absurd. If Grandfather’s condition is so bad that he can't even take herbs, how could they absorb anything? It would only worsen the condition.

Traditional Chinese medicine could never cure this disease, and it would have shocked the world long ago.

Doctor Wang and his medical team looked at Su Nantian taking the pulse with a sneer. They didn’t believe it, and they had absolute confidence that traditional Chinese medicine could not cure this disease.

Lin Yulong’s eyes narrowed. The glance Su Nantian had given him made him feel a strange shock.

This was impossible. He definitely couldn’t have seen it. It wasn’t possible.

It was a new, colorless and odorless poison developed abroad, with no symptoms at all. It could slowly worsen the patient's condition.

It was extremely expensive, and even he felt a bit of pain.

To scare me? A little talent, I’ll play with you until you die.

His eyes turned cruel toward Su Nantian, but he quickly regained his composure and hid the cruelty in his eyes.

After a while, Su Nantian had roughly understood Grandfather’s condition. Overall, Grandfather's body was still good. Compared to most elderly people, his physique was quite strong. Plus, he had already suffered from paralysis, which was quite good. He had a plan and began the treatment.

First, he needed to unblock the blocked blood vessel. He carefully guided a thread of internal energy through the silver needle into it, as Grandfather’s blood vessels and meridians were very fragile and might not withstand it.

When he reached the blockage, Su Nantian easily dissolved the blood clot. He hadn’t expected it to be so easy—perhaps because of the fluids given by those doctors.

But he didn’t think about it much.

Then, he took out the silver needles he carried and said, "I need a set of better gold needles."

"Of course, no problem."

Lin Yuhu quickly replied. Although he was very curious about the results, seeing that Su Nantian didn’t say anything, he suppressed his curiosity and waited quietly.

Acupuncture? This could cure Grandfather. Although acupuncture does have some merits, it's still a minor art.

And to date, no one has explained how it works. Whether the acupoints exist or not is still unconfirmed.

It's absurd. How could this be possible?

Although acupuncture has existed since ancient times, no one has ever heard of it curing such a disease. Not even other major diseases.

Doctor Wang and the others saw the silver needles and showed more disdain on their faces.

If it weren’t for Su Nantian’s eyes earlier, they would have argued already.

Even one doctor took off his white coat and left directly.

Doctor Wang was very eager to see what would happen next, watching it with interest. He wanted to see how Su Nantian would beg for his help and kneel down...

Thinking of this, Doctor Wang’s mouth curled into a smile, though it was lewd.

Not long after, the gold needles arrived.

The reason for choosing gold needles was their good flexibility and purity of material, with no impurities. The internal energy ran smoothly without blockage, making the perception more sensitive.

Su Nantian picked up the gold needles and didn’t hesitate. He carefully inserted them into the Hundred Meetings (Baihui) and Great Vertebrae (Dazhu) acupoints on the head.

Each point was a vital spot; one mistake could lead to an accident.

Su Nantian performed seven acupuncture points, and the positions formed a strange shape.

This was Su Nantian’s self-created "Seven Star Revival," secretly aligned with the Dao, which he had领悟 (realized) during a night of observing the stars.

"Seven Star Revival" means that with seven needles, one can revive the dead and steal life from the King of Hell.

The seven needles connected to form an endless cycle, with the greatest feature being that internal energy could stimulate tissue regeneration and restore activity.

Su Nantian held two needles with his fingers, directing internal energy into them. The seven points connected to form a cycle, continuously stimulating the brain cells that had long been dead due to lack of blood flow.

Because Grandfather's body was weak, Su Nantian had to continuously and slowly inject internal energy without any slack. If he missed even a moment, the internal energy would be unguided and directly cause brain cell death.

Su Nantian was very familiar with this. The only problem might be the time it took to lock in.

After 15 minutes, Su Nantian waved his hand. The seven gold needles were removed almost simultaneously.

Then he thought for a moment and took a paper cup from the table. He slowly adjusted his internal energy, carefully drawing out a drop of blood and placing it in the cup. He added a little cold water.

He opened Grandfather’s mouth and poured it in.

The water was to dilute the blood.

He was afraid Grandfather’s body was too weak to withstand the power of this blood.

To remove the poison, he had countless methods. After all, his body only contained a few drops.

But the main reason for giving Grandfather this drop of blood was because of Lin Suyun. He didn’t want to see her sad and upset anymore.

Chapter 17: Humiliating the Opponents

Everyone watching this scene was stunned. Where did that drop of blood come from? What treatment method was this?

That drop of blood's cleanliness was hard to say. After all, many diseases are transmitted through the blood. If he drank your blood and got another disease, who would be responsible? The doctors saw this and wanted to stop him.

But thinking of Su Nantian’s eyes that seemed to want to kill, no one dared to speak up.

But Doctor Wang spoke up. He could not bear it anymore.

"Su Nantian, stop acting. You think you can cure Grandfather by just pulling out a drop of blood? I tell you, it's impossible."

The others saw Doctor Wang scolded and immediately felt bolder.

"Exactly, your performance was very impressive. You could win an Oscar. How about giving you the Best Actor award? Haha."

I’m very curious where that drop of blood came from.

"Think you’re a miracle doctor? Has Grandfather woken up?"

"Look carefully, has he woken up?"

"Do you think just by taking a pulse and acupuncture can cure him?

It's absurd."

"If he gets another disease, you’ll be in trouble."

The surrounding people saw Su Nantian didn’t speak and thought he was nervous, so they became more brazen in mocking him. They had already forgotten Su Nantian’s previous words.

Lin Yulong's doubts were finally gone. He was just a clown, thinking he could cure Grandfather with some skills?

Although his acupuncture and pulse-taking were very skilled and experienced, it didn’t mean he could cure Grandfather.

Lin Yulong said nothing now. He just watched the doctors mock Su Nantian.

He wanted to see how Su Nantian would end this farce.

His eyes showed a triumphant smile.

"Everyone, shut up."

Lin Suyun could no longer bear it and finally exploded.

"Nantian, how is Grandfather?"

Lin Suyun's hand trembled slightly as she pulled Su Nantian’s arm and asked softly.

"Rest assured, Grandfather will be fine."

Su Nantian looked deeply at Lin Suyun and said softly.

Lin Suyun felt her heart ease. Although Grandfather hadn’t woken up yet, she believed him.

"Kid, stop acting. I can't bear it anymore. You've been playing with my sister and us all around, what's your intention?"

"If Grandfather’s condition doesn’t worsen, it's okay. If something unexpected happens, you’ll be in trouble."

Lin Qi looked at Su Nantian with disdain and said harshly.

"Lin Qi, what do you mean? Do you really hope Grandfather doesn’t wake up?"

Lin Suyun looked at Lin Qi with icy eyes.

"It's a horse and a mule, wait for the doctors to check."

Lin Qi bowed to those doctors.

"Lin少爷 said it. If you have the ability, let us check."

Some doctors immediately spoke up.

"I think there's no need for that now."

Su Nantian said calmly.

"Haha, are you afraid? If so, kneel and call your grandfather three times. Haha..."

Doctor Wang laughed but suddenly fell silent. His eyes almost popped out as he stared at the old man on the bed.

Grandfather had awakened!

At that moment, those doctors who had previously mocked Su Nantian fell silent and couldn’t say a word.

Lin Yulong’s eyes were full of shock. He rubbed his eyes, and waves of surprise surged in his heart. He had cured him. Did he notice something unusual about Grandfather’s body?

That glance...

Did it warn him? That was impossible. It was the most advanced poison from abroad, and even he had obtained it through special connections.

Before this, he had tested it with people. He had asked all the famous doctors in the country to check and no one found anything wrong. How could a young boy do it?

If so, don’t blame me for being ruthless.

Lin Yulong was one hundred and ten percent unwilling to believe it now.

Lin Qi stood there in a daze. He knew his father’s plan, but an unexpected change had occurred.

He looked at Lin Yulong and saw his father give him a meaningful glance. He nodded slightly, clenching his hand tighter.

Grandfather opened his lips slightly.

"Water."

The voice was so faint it was almost inaudible.

Then he slowly raised his right hand, reaching for the paper cup on the table.

Lin Suyun quickly poured a glass of water and handed it to him.

Then she was stunned, grabbed Grandfather’s right hand, and exclaimed:

"Grandfather's right hand is moving! It's moving!"

"What? That’s impossible?"

……

The doctors all let out expressions of disbelief.

Since the first paralysis, the brain area responsible for Grandfather’s right hand had died. After that, his condition was always treated by them, so they knew Grandfather’s right hand could not move. Not to mention lifting it to take the paper cup.

But this incredible scene appeared before them, as if a hallucination.

The mockery of Su Nantian earlier seemed to mock themselves. They were all stunned and didn’t know what to say.

Doctor Wang was even red-faced. He had previously boasted that Su Nantian should kneel and call him grandfather, but now he would have to kneel and call him grandfather?

Su Nantian looked at those who had mocked him earlier and said:

"Didn’t you say you were so arrogant before? Now why are you silent? Did you become mute? Who asked you to call me what?"

A thud.

The previously arrogant Doctor Wang fell to the ground and kept bowing, shouting grandfather, grandfather.

The other doctors behind him were all at a loss for words.

"Who is your grandfather? Our family doesn’t have such grandchildren."

The one who spoke was not Su Nantian, but Grandfather Lin Tianyi, the head of the Lin family.

Lin Tianyi turned to Su Nantian and said with a bow:

"Thank you, sir. I am deeply grateful. Whatever your request is, please say it. I will do my best and fulfill it."

Lin Tianyi knew his illness could never be cured in this life. This young man was definitely not ordinary. If he could establish a good relationship, it would bring great benefits to the Lin family.

"Mr. Lin, there’s no need for such courtesy. I saved you mainly because of your granddaughter, Lin Suyun."

"Haha, I understand. This matter is easy to handle."

Lin Tianyi looked at Lin Suyun’s red face and then at Su Nantian, feeling very happy. This was more pleasing than his own recovery.

Lin Tianyi looked at Su Nantian with increasing admiration.

"Grandfather, this is truly great. You’ve finally awakened."

Lin Qi immediately approached with a smile.

At that moment, Su Nantian sensed a hint of killing intent. Immediately after, a sharp blade pierced Lin Suyun’s throat.

How could Su Nantian allow this to happen again, especially under his own eyes?
