She was angry because she believed she had brought Su Nantian good news.

Yet he didn’t even say thank you, as if it were his due.

On the other hand, she also wanted to test Su Nantian.

Lin Suyun was Su Nantian’s officially acknowledged girlfriend, but this little beauty Gao Jingjing...

Zhang Xue still couldn’t confirm her relationship with Su Nantian.

“Puhaha!”

Zhang Xue had just scolded Su Nantian when he burst into laughter.

“You silly girl, what are you thinking? Me and Jingjing have a pure sibling relationship.”

“What do you mean by ‘little girlfriend’? Again, your wording is inappropriate. My beautiful patrol captain.”

Su Nantian certainly couldn’t admit that in his heart, he had already coveted this “sister” Gao Jingjing.

Zhang Xue thought: "I believe you, ghost! How could such a beautiful girl not make you lustful?"

But she still spoke lightly: "Oh, if she’s not your girlfriend then it's fine. What does that have to do with me? Why explain it to me?"

"Also, who are you calling a silly girl? Dare I add another charge of verbal assault to your patrol team?"

Zhang Xue wasn’t giving in, but she still felt deeply flattered by Su Nantian’s words “my beautiful patrol captain.”

Women have vanity, and Zhang Xue was no exception.

Seeing Zhang Xue’s angry yet unreasonable behavior, Su Nantian felt neither repulsion nor fear.

Though his nerves were thick, he wasn’t foolish.

Since he had entered, this girl had run back and forth, looking worried.

To say Zhang Xue didn’t care about Su Nantian was something Su Nantian himself wouldn’t believe.

“This big-breasted girl, does she like me?”

Su Nantian didn’t think he was being self-obsessed this time. He said it aloud: “Zhang Xue, do you like me?”

Because it was an impulsive statement, Su Nantian said this without any of his usual teasing and carefree tone.

Yet the sentence sounded as if it had been asked seriously and earnestly.

Zhang Xue was stunned upon hearing this.

Seeing Su Nantian’s “serious” expression, Zhang Xue didn’t think he was joking.

“Should I tell him? I clearly like him.”

The fearless Zhang Xue now felt a moment of hesitation.

“Why are you thinking about this, Zhang Xue? This scoundrel already has two girlfriends. Why are you getting involved?”

Zhang Xue was extremely conflicted at this moment.

Just as she was struggling with her own thoughts, the door to the interrogation room opened.

Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing had arrived at the patrol division with Lin Tianyi and Gao Peng.

Naturally, they knew that when Gao Qingyun arrived later, the situation would turn around.

After chatting with her grandfather and meeting Yang Yuansheng, the city’s top leader, Lin Suyun then went to find Su Nantian.

Finding the interrogation room door open, she didn’t think much and walked in directly.

She saw her boyfriend looking at Zhang Xue with a “deep” expression.

Then she saw Zhang Xue’s flushed face.

“This ungrateful person! He's flirting with girls while I'm not around! See if I'll care about him!”

Lin Suyun muttered Su Nantian’s name while coughing a few times.

Hearing someone had arrived, Zhang Xue immediately snapped out of it.

But this time she didn’t argue with Su Nantian, instead saying: “You two talk. I’ll leave first.”

Then she ran away like a rabbit.

Seeing Lin Suyun, Su Nantian smiled: “Hehe, my wife has come. Is your grandfather here too?”

Su Nantian had now regained his thick-nerved nature, not feeling anything was wrong.

“Who is your wife! Go find Zhang Xue!”

Lin Suyun suddenly said this, leaving Su Nantian bewildered.

“What’s wrong with you, my wife? I didn’t do anything with Zhang Xue. Why are you upset again?”

Su Nantian’s words made Lin Suyun think he was pretending to be ignorant, making her even angrier.

“You said nothing? You didn’t provoke her, why was she so red-faced? Why did she run away when she saw me and Jingjing?”

Lin Suyun now looked like a detective, noticing every tiny clue without missing anything.

“You women are really something. Are you all on your period or what?”

“Zhang Xue just asked me if Jingjing was my girlfriend. What’s that got to do with anything!”

Su Nantian looked innocent, feeling targeted.

“Even looking at her there, and saying she’s big, and daring to say you two didn’t do anything? Do you have to sleep with her before it’s considered something!”

Lin Suyun didn’t know where this anger came from. Although she had seen a suspicious scene, there was no reason to say Zhang Xue and Su Nantian definitely had something.

Perhaps because women's intuition was accurate.

Lin Suyun’s intuition about Zhang Xue was like her previous one with Gao Jingjing.

She felt this woman would definitely have a complicated connection with Su Nantian in the future.

Hearing Su Nantian’s words, Gao Jingjing felt embarrassed. She then tried to calm Lin Suyun.

“Suyun sister, you don’t understand. You don’t know what Nantian brother is like.”

“Right now, the most important thing is to save Nantian brother. Once we get out, you can scold him all you want.”

Upon hearing Gao Jingjing’s words, Su Nantian almost vomited the food he had eaten.

But he could only be like a bitter melon eater, unable to speak.

“Jingjing, Jingjing, you’re really setting me up, aren’t you? Saying this makes it seem like I have something with Zhang Xue.”

He inwardly cursed, but seeing Gao Jingjing’s innocent and pure beauty, he just thought she had spoken out of place to calm Lin Suyun.

Lin Suyun now felt her anger subside a bit.

“See, in your sister’s eyes, you’re not a good person.”

Lin Suyun said this and also glared at Su Nantian.

Gao Jingjing then realized she had spoken out of place.

“Nantian brother, I didn’t mean to. Oh, Suyun sister, Nantian brother is a good person. Oh, I don’t know what to say.”

Gao Jingjing was still innocent. She took Lin Suyun’s joke seriously and now looked like she was about to cry.

“Okay, Jingjing. It's fine. You Suyun sister was just joking. I know you meant well, and I won’t be angry.”

Su Nantian comforted Gao Jingjing like an older brother.

“Come on, everyone. Let’s discuss it together in the interrogation room.”

The first to enter was Feng Yue, followed by Yang Yuansheng, Gao Qingyun, Lin Tianyi and Tang Wensheng, Gao Peng.

It turned out that Gao Qingyun had arrived.

Chapter 84: Tang Wensheng's Compromise

“Grandpa!” Gao Jingjing saw her grandfather Gao Qingyun and rushed to him.

“Grandpa, you must save Nantian brother!”

Gao Jingjing clung to Gao Qingyun’s chest, her eyes red from crying.

Tang Wensheng had just met Gao Qingyun and was like when he first met Lin Tianyi, exchanging greetings.

But he clearly knew the weight of this Gao Qingyun was a different level from Lin Tianyi.

Therefore, his intention to approach and flatter Gao Qingyun was more prominent.

As for the others, like why he had come, he didn’t dare to ask much.

When he entered the interrogation room and saw a beautiful girl rushing toward Gao Qingyun calling him grandpa, Tang Wensheng was stunned.

Everyone sat in a circle around Su Nantian in the small interrogation room.

Feng Yue stood at the front like a host.

“Senior Gao, Mr. Yang, Captain Zhang, Senior Lin, Senior Tang, I think we should watch the surveillance footage again.”

Feng Yue had long been a veteran in the system and was already an expert.

From the order he called out everyone's names, one could see their respective standings.

Even Yang Yuansheng, the city’s top leader and Captain Zhang Xiaotian had to be placed behind, with Gao Qingyun as the most respected.

As for Lin Tianyi and Tang Wensheng, as ordinary businessmen, even though they were extremely wealthy and the main party responsible for this incident, they could only be placed after those mentioned above.

“Captain Feng, play the video.” Gao Qingyun ordered.

In fact, except for the newly arrived Gao Qingyun and Zhang Xiaotian, everyone else had already seen it.

So this playback was mainly for them to watch.

Tang Wensheng’s confusion was resolved after the video started.

When Gao Jingjing and Lin Suyun appeared in the playback, Tang Wensheng suddenly understood.

“That girl next to Lin Suyun is none other than Gao Jingjing!”

Tang Wensheng inwardly cursed.

He had thought she was just a regular girl, only unusually beautiful.

But he hadn’t expected her to be the daughter of the Gao family.

If it was just with Lin Tianyi, Tang Wensheng wouldn’t have been afraid.

After all, although the Lin family was powerful in Fengcheng, Jiangzhou was no less so.

Although the Tang family had no absolute strength in Fengcheng, they were among the top in Jiangzhou.

As long as he wanted, he could definitely use his influence in the Jiangzhou business circle to contact the leadership of Jiangzhou.

Then have the leadership of Jiangzhou coordinate with Fengcheng authorities.

Although it was just for his son, he could easily give more sponsorship.

After all, no matter what industry or circle, who would turn down money?

However, the situation had completely exceeded his expectations because the Gao family was involved!

At this moment, Tang Wensheng anxiously glanced at his side at Gao Qingyun.

He wanted to read some emotional changes on the other’s face.

Although both were old men, if an outsider looked at them now, they would only see Tang Wensheng as a humble servant carefully observing his master’s expression.

Su Nantian sitting in front of everyone hadn’t noticed these things.

This fool had been here too long and was bored, so he fell asleep right there!

Seeing the video of Tang Sanqian’s lewd face and his granddaughter hiding next to Lin Suyun, Gao Qingyun was furious.

“Unthinkable! My granddaughter has never suffered such humiliation!”

Gao Qingyun slammed his hand on the table, his white eyebrows furrowed. His tone was no longer as amiable as before.

This outburst made Tang Wensheng shudder.

And Su Nantian, who was dozing off, woke up.

Feng Yue saw this and immediately paused the video.

Gao Jingjing hurried to Gao Qingyun’s side, rubbing his back as he coughed violently.

“Grandpa, grandpa, don’t be angry. Don’t get upset.”

“You see, I’m fine now. Thanks to Nantian brother, and Suyun sister, we were safe.”

Gao Jingjing comforted Gao Qingyun while also speaking well of Su Nantian.

“Yes, without Su Xiao You, that beast might have done anything!”

After saying this, Gao Qingyun cast a disapproving glance at Tang Wensheng.

Tang Wensheng, who had previously shown arrogance and domineering behavior toward Lin Tianyi and Feng Yue, now was silent and lowered his head.

“Captain Zhang, Captain Feng, Mr. Yang, I think the surveillance footage has already shown clearly.”

“Lin Miss and my granddaughter were normally shopping in the mall. Both are good girls, not causing trouble or inciting problems.”

“It was this Tang Sanqian who took advantage of the situation and harassed them in broad daylight.”

“And our Nantian brother, as Lin Miss’s boyfriend, also a good friend and older brother to my granddaughter.”

Gao Qingyun said this without any awkwardness, as they were now on the same side with the Lin family. There was no need to argue about titles and relationships.

“He stood up bravely, showing the courage of a man.”

“Later events my granddaughter and I have roughly told you. Nantian brother initially didn’t want to hit Tang Sanqian hard.”

“But this man was overbearing and continued to speak disrespectfully. Nantian brother then became angry and no longer showed mercy.”

“I don’t think he did anything wrong. Let me ask everyone here, if you encountered such a bad situation, what would you do?”

Gao Qingyun spoke with reason and righteousness. No one dared to interrupt.

“What is your intention, Senior Gao?” Yang Yuansheng asked cautiously at this point.

“I think Nantian should be released immediately. As for injuring Tang Sanqian, my family is willing to cover all medical expenses!”

Gao Qingyun said boldly. Lin Tianyi also followed up: “We can’t let Senior Gao bear it all. After all, Nantian brother also saved my granddaughter. I will cover half the medical expenses.”

Silent until now, Zhang Xiaotian spoke.

“Senior Tang, since the guardians of the two ladies have already expressed their positions, what do you think?”

Zhang Xiaotian had worked in Jiangzhou for a while, so he spoke politely to Tang Wensheng.

“Senior Lin, Senior Gao, I have no objection to your proposal of covering the medical expenses. However…” Tang Wensheng hesitated.

“However what?” Gao Qingyun asked impatiently.

“However, releasing Nantian like this might be a bit excessive.”

Tang Wensheng carefully searched for words that wouldn’t anger Gao Qingyun.

He understood that the people in Fengcheng clearly took Gao Qingyun as their leader, so his attitude was the most important.

“Senior Tang, my conditions are clear. If you continue to bother Nantian,”

“I can’t guarantee what actions the Gao family will take next!”

Gao Qingyun’s words clearly carried a threat.

“After all, the family head of Gao is an official. The authority of a leader isn’t something to be taken lightly.”

Su Nantian thought inwardly.

“Okay, I agree!” Tang Wensheng suddenly said.

Chapter 85: Making the Acquaintance of the City’s Top Leader

Seeing how Gao Qingyun and Tang Wensheng almost had a clash.

Yang Yuansheng was about to mediate.

But he hadn’t expected Tang Wensheng to easily give in under Gao Qingyun’s pressure.

“Since you two have reached an agreement, I think Nantian can be released.”

Yang Yuansheng summarized.

At this moment, Gao Jingjing’s heart finally relaxed. She even cried with excitement and hugged Lin Suyun.

Upon hearing his “decision,” Su Nantian smiled gently.

Then he gave Gao Qingyun a thumbs-up.

Tang Wensheng was even more shocked at this scene: “This Su Nantian is so close to Gao Qingyun!”

He thought Su Nantian was a junior dependent on Gao Qingyun.

Naturally, he didn’t know that Gao Qingyun would be delighted to take Su Nantian as a son-in-law.

After being released from the handcuffs, Su Nantian saw Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing, two beautiful girls, both looking like a plum blossom in spring rain.

His heart warmed. In front of everyone, he opened his arms.

Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing immediately rushed into his arms.

It was truly soft and fragrant in his embrace, both big and small.

At this time, Zhang Xue returned to report some situations to Feng Yue.

She caught Su Nantian hugging two beauties.

“Shameless! Doing this in front of everyone!” Zhang Xue felt she was about to die from anger.

Su Nantian, facing away from Zhang Xue, naturally couldn’t see her expression.

But Lin Suyun was different. At this moment, her little woman’s heart also stirred.

Seeing Zhang Xue had returned, Lin Suyun hugged Su Nantian tighter.

But with so many elders present, how could Zhang Xue get angry?

So she didn’t look at Su Nantian and the two girls, but simply had a few words with Feng Yue before preparing to leave.

Although she disliked Su Nantian, after knowing he was safe, Zhang Xue was actually happy.

“Cough cough.” Gao Qingyun suddenly coughed, as if reminding Su Nantian to stop. He had been hugging for too long and was ignoring everyone else.

Su Nantian immediately understood, releasing Lin Suyun. He also saw Zhang Xue.

“Captain Zhang, thank you!” Su Nantian said to Zhang Xue.

Zhang Xue had already prepared to leave, but she hadn’t expected Su Nantian to say this.

Seeing Su Nantian’s smiling and cheeky face, Zhang Xue wished she could slap him.

“Oh, what for thanking me? You should thank Senior Gao, Senior Lin, and Mr. Yang.”

Zhang Xue’s tone was very cold.

“Regardless, I still want to thank you.” Su Nantian said sincerely.

Zhang Xue didn’t know what to say.

“Xiaoxue, go and sort out the situation of that thing first. The Captain will look at it later.”

Feng Yue now gave her a break.

Zhang Xue looked at her father Zhang Xiaotian, who gave her a silent nod.

So Zhang Xue finally escaped the awkward situation.

“Sigh, this girl must have fallen for it.” Zhang Xiaotian thought to himself.

Although his daughter had proven herself by not working under the Fengcheng Patrol Division she commanded.

Instead, she voluntarily applied to join Feng Yue’s Fengyue District Patrol Subdivision, leading to fewer meetings between father and daughter.

However, a father knows his daughter best.

Zhang Xiaotian had already met Su Nantian before.

Feng Yue could see that Zhang Xue was actually fond of Su Nantian. How could Zhang Xiaotian, the father, not see it?

“Senior Lin, Senior Gao, I’ve troubled you this time.”

“Great kindness needs no thanks. I will definitely repay you in the future.”

Su Nantian said this and bowed, making Lin Tianyi and Gao Qingyun both laugh.

At this moment, the most embarrassed was Tang Wensheng.

His son had been beaten up; the “perpetrator” was talking and laughing in front of him.

Although Gao Qingyun and Lin Tianyi said they would cover the medical expenses for Tang Sanqian.

But as rich as Tang Wensheng was, it wasn’t the money for those two medical expenses he was short of. He wanted a revenge.

However, Gao’s power was too great. Tang Wensheng, over seventy years old, with sharp eyesight.

Besides Gao Qingyun and Lin Tianyi, how could he not see that the city’s top leader Yang Yuansheng also clearly wanted to protect Su Nantian.

“Don’t know who this kid is, but all the elders in Fengcheng are determined to protect him.”

“Strong dragons don’t suppress local snakes. I’ll go back and think of a plan again.”

“Gentlemen take revenge, ten years is not late! Kid, wait for me. I will definitely avenge my son!”

Not afraid of being stolen from, but afraid of being watched. Su Nantian and the Tang family had definitely made a deep grudge.

Tang Wensheng felt his teeth itching with hatred, but he kept a calm face.

“Everyone, I’ll take my leave.” Tang Wensheng said and bid farewell to Gao Qingyun and others.

“Old man, go back and manage your son properly. No need to get beaten again!”

Su Nantian was in a good mood and couldn’t help but add salt to the wound, being very arrogant.

Tang Wensheng had already turned away. Upon hearing this, his heart felt like it was stabbed.

He stopped for a moment, almost trembling with anger.

If it weren’t for his attention to health and exercise, this one would have made him die from anger.

But Tang Wensheng said nothing more and left.

Lin Suyun, being a woman, was very soft-hearted.

Although she didn’t like Tang Wensheng’s arrogance before, now that Su Nantian was safe, she felt Tang Wensheng looked quite pitiable.

“Nantian, did you say too much just now? After all, he was standing on his father’s side.”

“Suyun, drawing a dragon is hard to draw its bones. Knowing people and their faces but not their hearts.”

“This old man may seem like he said nothing and left, but he’s definitely not satisfied.”

“If it weren’t for the support of all these elders here, would he have submitted?”

“So I warned him just now. If he causes trouble again, I won’t be merciful either.”

Su Nantian said this and clenched his fists again.

“Young people are hot-tempered. Mr. Yang, don’t take it personally.” Gao Qingyun said this to Yang Yuansheng.

After all, among those present, the official representative was Mr. Yang.

So no matter when, Gao Qingyun also paid full respect to him.

“No problem, no problem. Su brother’s anger for a woman is truly admirable.” Yang Yuansheng didn’t hide his admiration for Su Nantian.

“Nantian, let me introduce you. This is Mr. Yang, the current top leader of Fengcheng. You’ve been paying attention to this matter and helped a lot.”

Gao Qingyun introduced Yang Yuansheng to Su Nantian.

“Earlier, Suyun and Jingjing also told me. Thank you, Mr. Yang.”

Chapter 86: Yang Yuansheng's Assassination

“Senior Brother, you’re too kind. I didn’t do anything. It was all Senior Gao’s hard work.”

Yang Yuansheng spoke truthfully, as Tang Wensheng finally submitted mainly due to Gao Qingyun’s power.

After Su Nantian's matter was resolved, everyone prepared to go home or return to work.

Yang Yuansheng walked out of the patrol division with Gao Qingyun and Zhang Xiaotian. His car was already waiting outside.

Su Nantian, Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing followed behind the three.

As they just stepped out of the patrol division, Su Nantian heard a very faint sound of something breaking through the air.

“Something’s wrong! There's danger.”

The next second, before anyone could react, Su Nantian swiftly stepped in front of Yang Yuansheng to block it.

There was a sharp sound, like something hitting an iron plate.

A sniper bullet fell on the ground in front of Su Nantian.

Gao Qingyun and others were shocked.

There was an assassin!

“Senior Gao, Captain Zhang, you protect Mr. Yang and Suyun, Jingjing first. I’ll be back soon.”

Su Nantian said this and ran in the direction of the bullet.

If it weren’t for Su Nantian’s iron body, which could withstand a bullet that could pierce concrete walls, Yang Yuansheng would have already been “chilled to the bone.”

Everyone was shocked and quickly got into their respective cars.

Gao’s car and Yang Yuansheng's car were specially made to be bulletproof, so sitting inside was the safest.

“Peng, you first send the ladies back to Fengyue residential area.” Gao Qingyun ordered.

“Senior Gao, Senior Lin, will Su Nantian be okay?”

Concerned about Su Nantian who had just saved his life, Yang Yuansheng was very worried.

“Mr. Yang, don’t worry about Su Brother. He already blocked the bullet. What else are you worried about?” Lin Tianyi comforted Yang Yuansheng.

“Senior Lin is right. I haven’t recovered yet, and I forgot that Su Nantian took the bullet with his bare hands.”

Yang Yuansheng said this and smiled awkwardly.

After calming down, Yang Yuansheng was more determined that Su Nantian was indeed extraordinary.

“Senior Lin, Senior Gao, do you have time later? I would like to invite both of you to my mansion.”

“Also, I hope you can bring Su Brother along too.”

Yang Yuansheng said this sincerely.

This showed that he no longer had any concerns about Su Nantian going alone to chase the culprit.

In fact, he felt that Su Nantian would soon resolve the trouble and return.

Gao Qingyun smiled and said, “Good. Then I’ll be a guest.”

“Where is the honor? It’s my honor to have you two come to my mansion.”

At that moment, Lin Tianyi and Gao Qingyun got into Yang Yuansheng’s car and headed to the Yang mansion.

Su Nantian felt that since he entered the sixth level of cultivation, his perception of danger had become more acute.

“Unfortunately, my cultivation is still a bit low. If I had the strength of the innate realm, my spiritual sense could recover some more. At that time, I would have already caught this guy.”

Su Nantian followed the feeling and chased after it. The more he went, the closer he got to the abandoned chemical plant in Fengcheng’s suburbs.

Bai Suxi wore black clothes and ran swiftly through the narrow alleys of old Fengcheng.

She was ordered to assassinate Yang Yuansheng, the first leader of Fengcheng.

Originally, for an international A-grade assassin like her, this mission should have been as easy as taking something from a pocket.

But she hadn’t expected a sudden young man to block her bullet!

Even more terrifying was that the sniper shot had been over 500 meters away, and this young man had almost instantly located her position.

She had planned to shoot again if the first shot failed, but she found herself completely out of control.

She decided to abandon this mission with the calmness and judgment of a professional assassin.

She ran away quickly!

As a top-class killer, her skills in killing were one thing. Her escape techniques had to be perfect too. Bai Suxi was clearly an expert in this.

However, she made a mistake again while running.

This terrifying man was like a fierce and patient wolf, chasing his prey relentlessly.

“How could this be! Yang Yuansheng doesn’t have a single bodyguard worth mentioning?”

Bai Suxi was in panic, constantly recalling the intelligence she had gathered before the mission.

Her organization, “Honey Badger Bounty Killer Corps,” was unknown to ordinary people.

But in the international mercenary and killer circles, it was a well-known name.

The organization’s name came from the African small mammal honey badger.

Don’t be fooled by its size, but it is the natural enemy of venomous snakes and can even bite through the hard shell of a turtle.

And this animal seems to never know fear, and can fight with lions and tigers. Sometimes it even hunts baby Nile crocodiles.

Just like the organization’s name, this group of killers had super perseverance and combat power. They were top-tier assassins!

But this time, it was not just a fight with lions and tigers.

Ordinary cultivators could easily kill special forces, let alone Su Nantian, this变态.

“Not good. Running like this isn’t a solution. Let me lure him to a secluded place and kill him!”

Bai Suxi thought this way, so she led Su Nantian to the city suburbs.

“This killer is interesting. She even uses perfume! Is she a woman?”

Su Nantian sniffed the almost imperceptible scent on the way.

The city suburbs’ abandoned chemical plant.

Su Nantian chased her here and stopped, because he clearly felt the prey had stopped running.

“Maybe she’s tired? Impossible. It's not that far.”

Su Nantian thought while estimating the distance.

Although for ordinary people, twenty to thirty kilometers was far, but for a killer it wasn’t.

Especially since Bai Suxi had abandoned her heavy sniper rifle and was now light and fast.

“Then it’s not tired. It must be…”

A breaking sound came from behind, Su Nantian's eyes narrowed slightly. He skillfully moved to the side.

A black figure with a sharp light flashed!

Bai Suxi attacked Su Nantian’s back of the head with a heavy strike, but it was dodged.

She used all her strength for this attack, and because of the inertia, she went far away.

After rolling on the ground a few times, she finally stood up with one knee.

Bai Suxi stood face to face with Su Nantian.

Su Nantian saw a pale-skinned woman, high nose bridge, short hair neatly combed, pink lips, and a rather prominent face.

Bai Suxi was tall, almost the same height as Su Nantian. She held a combat knife in her hand and stared at Su Nantian with fierce eyes.

Su Nantian was surprised: “Oh my god! She's such a beautiful girl!”

Chapter 87: I Really Can’t Bring Myself to Hit You

Bai Suxi failed in her ambush and now was more cautious.

Seeing the opponent's serious attitude, Su Nantian didn’t feel worried at all.

After a short standoff, Su Nantian suddenly laughed.

“Hey, missy, are you kidding me? You look so fresh, like a high school girl. Hahaha!”

Su Nantian spoke to himself but didn’t notice Bai Suxi’s face had turned icy.

“Lecher, you’re asking for death!”

Bai Suxi shouted and attacked again.

Although she was a woman, her attacks were as fierce and bold as men.

This made Su Nantian secretly admire.

Bai Suxi used several killing moves, but she didn’t harm Su Nantian even a little.

If Su Nantian chasing her was like a wolf, then the Su Nantian now fighting with her was more like an agile eel.

Seemingly walking calmly, he deflected blows with a light touch.

Even Bai Suxi, who was calm, now became frustrated.

Her fast and sharp moves seemed to slow down in the eyes of this man with a sly smile.

Another dagger strike and horizontal kick were dodged and deflected by Su Nantian, returning to a standoff.

This back-and-forth had cost Bai Suxi a lot of energy, and now her forehead was sweating.

“Why don’t you attack?” Bai Suxi asked Su Nantian, confused.

“I really can’t bring myself to hit you because you’re so beautiful.”

Su Nantian said this while shaking his head with a sly smile, as if he was helpless about not wanting to attack.

Bai Suxi heard this and got angry again. This was clearly a blatant contempt for her.

She was about to attack again but was interrupted by Su Nantian.

“Hey, big beauty, can we take a break? You can’t beat me anyway. Let’s chat for a while.” Su Nantian said lazily.

“Stop talking nonsense. I’ll kill you!” Bai Suxi ignored Su Nantian’s words and attacked again with the dagger.

This time, Su Nantian didn’t just dodge.

When Bai Suxi’s knife was about to reach his throat, he suddenly extended one hand and firmly grabbed Bai Suxi’s slender wrist.

Su Nantian slightly pulled his hand to the side and added pressure, making Bai Suxi feel pain. Her knife fell to the ground.

But she still wouldn’t submit, even though one hand was controlled by Su Nantian.

Her long leg still found space to act, and she used her knee to hit Su Nantian’s stomach.

Su Nantian saw this and a sly smile flashed across his face.

He didn’t dodge or avoid, but directly endured Bai Suxi’s attack.

Bai Suxi thought she was about to knock Su Nantian down, but her knee hit a concrete wall and couldn’t move.

At this moment, Su Nantian swung his hand and threw Bai Suxi out. Because one of her feet was raised, she lost balance and fell down hard.

Su Nantian saw this and laughed again.

Bai Suxi had been so exhausted she was red-faced, but she hadn’t harmed Su Nantian even a little.

For a top assassin, this was an unprecedented humiliation!

Bai Suxi now even felt relieved that she had come alone for this mission.

She didn’t want anyone else to see her now in such a pitiful state.

“How about chatting now?” Su Nantian said leisurely, lighting a cigarette and saying this in an annoying way.

Bai Suxi wiped her bottom and stood up.

She thought: “Okay, this guy is really strong. I’ll stop fighting with him for now and see what he says.”

“Who are you? Where do you live? Who sent you to kill Yang Yuansheng? Why did you want to kill him?”

“Sorry, I think that was too many questions. Let me first tell you who you are. By the way, I’m Su Nantian.”

Su Nantian introduced himself casually, completely without a warrior’s posture. It was more like flirting with a girl.

“None of your business.” Bai Suxi still had a cold face.

“You said that without any meaning.”

Su Nantian found himself talking more when he saw a beautiful girl. This time, he even blurted out a Sichuan dialect he had just learned from watching TV.

“You’re also from Sichuan?” Unexpectedly, Su Nantian’s casual words sparked Bai Suxi's curiosity.

“I am, but I’m not. I am, but I cook Sichuan cuisine very well. Let me tell you…”

Su Nantian saw Bai Suxi seemed to want to chat and opened his mouth.
