Nan Gong Ping led Su Nantian through his villa, inspecting everything before finally guiding him into the grand hall. There, over a dozen men in black suits and dark glasses stood in formation, their disciplined presence quite impressive.

"Su Nantian," Nan Gong Ping said, "these are my bodyguards. Before your arrival, they were responsible for my safety. Now that you're here, they'll answer to you. From now on, it's your responsibility."

After speaking, Nan Gong Ping addressed the guards: "Listen up. This is Su Nantian. He'll be your new commander. All operations must follow his orders. Understood?"

"Understood!" they replied in unison. Su Nantian nodded, satisfied that their discipline was genuine—no mere facade of competence.

Though Su Nantian had come to infiltrate the Wu family, he resolved to fulfill his duties for now. At least, it was a gesture of gratitude toward the Nan family's guidance. He would train these guards to repay their kindness.

He nodded and said, "Hello, I'm Su Nantian. Some of you may not have met me before. Today, a few of you attended the Tian Shui Building, so you've at least met me once."

He then pointed to five men and asked, "You five accompanied the young master to Tian Shui Building, right?"

The room fell silent. Even Nan Gong Ping was stunned; he hadn't known who had accompanied him. How could Su Nantian recognize them?

Moreover, Su Nantian's attention at Tian Shui Building had been drawn to Nan Gong Yuyan, and he'd barely spoken with Su Nantian before the confrontation with Zhang Yu. Thus, it was astonishing that Su Nantian could identify these five men—despite their black suits and sunglasses, which obscured all visible features.

"Correct?" Su Nantian continued. "Those who went to Tian Shui Building, step forward!"

The five men hesitated before stepping forward. Nan Gong Ping was again stunned. This test of observation had been flawless.

Su Nantian's intent was clear: to demonstrate his capability and instill respect. These five men knew his strength, having witnessed him defeat Zhang Yu. He aimed to intimidate those who hadn't attended Tian Shui Building, ensuring they wouldn’t challenge him.

He couldn’t simply provoke one man to fight; that would make him appear erratic. This method was most effective. If they questioned his power, they’d seek out those who had met him at Tian Shui Building. Once they learned of his victory over Zhang Yu—and even against Zeng Chao—they’d avoid confrontation.

"Remember," Su Nantian added, "a bodyguard must possess exceptional perceptiveness to detect anomalies and protect the young master effectively." He subtly flattered Nan Gong Ping.

"Thus, I hope we cooperate well in the coming days. Execute tasks diligently and protect the young master. That’s all. I’ll assign specific training regimens based on your physical conditions. For now, you’re all unqualified."

The crowd stirred slightly but restrained their reactions.

"Some may think, 'I’ve trained for years and am muscular—how can I be unqualified?'" Su Nantian mused. Indeed, he wasn’t a bulky gym enthusiast. His physique was lean yet defined, proportioned perfectly without the bulk of a typical bodybuilder.

"Let me clarify," he continued, "many of your muscles are wasted—built through protein supplements and machines. They’re useless. Change your training habits, and in two weeks, you’ll see improvement."

As he spoke, a guard raised his hand. He said nothing but waited for Su Nantian to call him.

"Speak," Su Nantian said, recognizing the man as a potential challenger. This guard was the strongest among them, making him an obvious target.

"I don’t believe my muscles are useless," the man retorted. "I’ve never failed in missions. Doesn’t that prove their value?"

This man had previously led the guards, but Su Nantian’s arrival had demoted him. He resented Su Nantian but held back, knowing Nan Gong Ping had brought him. Yet he hadn’t expected Su Nantian to challenge him immediately.

Su Nantian smiled, anticipating this resistance. "Let’s settle this," he said, stepping forward to assess the man—pure muscle, a formidable presence.

He patted the man’s arm and said, "Your muscles are impressive but ineffective. They’re built through supplements and machines. While they look strong, your strength is weak. Even your arm isn’t remarkable—perhaps weaker than mine."

The man bristled. "You’re lying! Let’s fight!"

Before he could react, a guard whispered in his ear. The man’s expression shifted; he’d witnessed Su Nantian break Zhang Yu’s leg. Yet, he was no match for Su Nantian.

Nan Gong Ping interjected: "Enough, Wang Meng. You don’t understand how strong Su Nantian is. If you fight and lose, it’ll be embarrassing. Listen to him."

Wang Meng’s anger deepened. He’d been Nan Gong Ping’s trusted ally, but now the young master protected Su Nantian. This was unbearable.

"Big deal," Wang Meng scoffed. "He beat Zhang Yu. I’ve fought him evenly before!"

"Zhang Yu? You think he’s anything?" Nan Gong Ping replied. "Do you know how Su Nantian passed the elder’s test? He crippled Zeng Chao’s hand and leg. He’s probably in surgery now!"

The room gasped. The guards who’d seen Su Nantian defeat Zhang Yu hadn’t known about his subsequent test against Zeng Chao. Now they realized their ignorance.

Nan Gong Ping’s words carried weight; he wouldn’t lie. The news would spread soon, as Zeng Chao’s status in the Nan family was well-known. The revelation of Su Nantian’s dominance over Zeng Chao would be explosive.

Wang Meng deflated, his companions tugging his sleeve to stop him. Accepting defeat was the only choice.

Yet, Wang Meng’s resolve snapped again. "You may be strong in combat, but don’t deny my power! My muscles aren’t wasted. Let’s test our strength!"

Su Nantian hadn’t expected such stubbornness. He nodded, realizing he had to fight to convince Wang Meng.

"Fine," Su Nantian said. "If I win, you obey me without question. No regrets afterward."

Wang Meng nodded. "I accept! I, Wang Meng, will abide by your orders without complaint!"

"Bring the dumbbells," he ordered.

Su Nantian waved him off. "No need for weights."

"What? Are you giving up?" Wang Meng sneered, confident Su Nantian’s frail arms couldn’t match his.

"No," Su Nantian said, "this is a waste of time. Let’s settle it simply." He smiled. "Let’s wrestle. Who wins, their strength is greater. No objections?"

Wang Meng laughed. "You don’t know who I’ve wrestled before? Zeng Chao, that’s who. It proves your combat skills are superior, but strength is mine. I’ll play along."

The guards fetched a table for the match. "One round, young master as referee?" Su Nantian asked Nan Gong Ping.

Nan Gong Ping stood, "I’ll referee."

Wang Meng nodded. "One round only. No regrets!"

They approached the table, gripping hands. Nan Gong Ping adjusted their positions before shouting, "Begin!"

At first, neither gained ground. Their hands locked in a stalemate. Yet, Wang Meng’s face reddened as he strained, while Su Nantian remained calm.

The guards noticed this but focused on the hands. Only Nan Gong Ping saw Su Nantian’s composure and knew he’d win.

Wang Meng’s strength waned, while Su Nantian’s muscles flexed. In an instant, he forced Wang Meng’s wrist down.

"Result!" Nan Gong Ping declared. "Su Nantian wins. Wang Meng, obey him henceforth. This training is for your benefit. You’ll improve."

Chapter 461: Unexpected Joy

The match ended decisively. Wang Meng nodded, accepting his loss. He’d vowed to obey Su Nantian, and now he had no choice.

"Good," Su Nantian said, clapping Wang Meng’s shoulder. He didn’t dislike Wang Meng; anyone in his position would resist a newcomer.

"Trust me," Su Nantian said, "training will be tough, but your strength will improve. I promise it."

This was for all the guards.

"Go about your duties," Nan Gong Ping said. "Su Nantian, come with me."

The guards dispersed as Su Nantian followed Nan Gong Ping upstairs to his study.

Nan Gong Ping’s study was well-appointed, filled with books—primarily on finance and business. The worn pages suggested they were used, not merely displayed.

"Sit," Nan Gong Ping said, gesturing to a sofa. "I called you for an important matter. We’re visiting the Wu family soon, but we can’t bring many guards. I want you and Wang Meng to accompany me. Are you ready?"

He poured tea for himself and Su Nantian, appearing approachable.

Su Nantian accepted the cup, heart racing. His mission was to infiltrate the Wu family, and this opportunity arrived faster than expected.

"Master," he said, "I’ll protect you. But what is the Wu family’s purpose?"

Nan Gong Ping sipped tea, "The Wu family is one of five in the capital. We’ve a tradition: when selecting an heir, other families observe to ensure fairness. But it’s also a game of power. Some interfere, others use the chance to disrupt."

Nan Gong Ping’s voice carried concern. "You suspect someone will harm me?" Su Nantian asked, feigning ignorance.

Nan Gong Ping nodded. "Yes. We have two heirs: me and my sister, Nan Gong Yuyan. She’ll attend too. We’ve agreed to unite against external interference, but I must protect myself. I won’t harm her, but she may have allied with outsiders."

Nan Gong Yuyan’s fiancé belonged to another family, a risk Nan Gong Ping couldn’t ignore.

Su Nantian vowed, "Master, I’ll protect you. No one will harm you while I’m here."

Nan Gong Ping smiled, relieved. He’d doubted Su Nantian’s loyalty but now felt reassured.

Su Nantian inwardly scoffed; he’d never betray Nan Gong Ping, but this overreaction was foolish. Trusting a stranger so quickly was naive.

Yet he knew Nan Gong Ping wasn’t fit to lead the family. That was for Nan Gong Lin to decide.

Nan Gong Lin favored Nan Gong Ping, despite his sister’s superior strength. The family’s internal politics were complex.

Chapter 462: Liu Ran

Su Nantian’s training of the Nan family guards showed progress. Though not yet at his initial timeline, their strength had improved.

Wang Meng felt a profound change in his muscles. Initially sore from Su Nantian’s regimen, he soon felt invigorated. His strength surged, proving Su Nantian’s prowess.

Su Nantian spent days in the Nan household, overseeing security. With Nan Gong Ping preoccupied with preparations for the Wu family visit, he had little to do but ensure safety.

One day, Nan Gong Ping’s assistant approached him: "Master wants you. Clean up before going."

Su Nantian washed off sweat and entered Nan Gong Ping’s study.

"Master, what do you need?" he asked.

Nan Gong Ping glanced up from a book. "The Wu family contacted us. We leave tomorrow. Prepare."

Su Nantian’s heart raced but he masked it, replying calmly: "Understood. I’ll ensure your safety."

Nan Gong Ping waved him off, and Su Nantian returned to his room. He had no real preparations—only ensuring he could infiltrate the Wu family.

He checked his belongings and adjusted his disguise, crucial to avoid exposure. Only Wu You’er and her husband had seen his true face; he must maintain the disguise for success.

The next morning, Su Nantian rose early, leading guards to inspect the environment and check Nan Gong Ping’s car for tampering.

When Nan Gong Ping arrived, so did his sister, Nan Gong Yuyan. Zhang Yu’s injury had forced a replacement: Liu Ran.

Nan Gong Ping joked, "You’re favored by the elder. Zhang Yu’s injury left you without a guard—so Liu Ran was assigned. Envy?"

Su Nantian didn’t know Liu Ran’s role but glanced at Wang Meng, who explained: "Third in command. Liu Ran served the elder like Zeng Chao."

Su Nantian understood: the Wu family’s top guards were Zeng Chao, Liu Ran, and Zhang Yu. Now, with Zeng Chao and Zhang Yu defeated, Nan Gong Yuyan’s protection was weak.

Nan Gong Yuyan smiled, "I asked for Liu Ran after Zhang Yu’s injury."

Nan Gong Ping replied, "The elder’s favor is evident. I once asked for Liu Ran but was denied. You’ve managed it effortlessly."

Nan Gong Ping’s assistant remarked, "No need to worry. Liu Ran’s presence ensures your safety."

Su Nantian observed the assistant, suspecting hidden motives. His mission in the Wu family was perilous; he’d need to watch for threats and plan escape routes.

Chapter 463: Arrival at the Wu Family

The car left Nan Gong’s estate, taking over an hour to reach the Wu family’s domain. The capital was vast, and each clan controlled its territory.

Su Nantian gazed at the Wu family’s estate, comparing it to Nan Gong’s. While Nan Gong’s home was ancient and regal, the Wu family’s buildings were modern, devoid of traditional charm.

Nan Gong Ping and Nan Gong Yuyan arrived first, greeted by a crowd of cars.

Nan Gong Ping asked his assistant, "How many have arrived?"

The assistant scanned the vehicles. "Everyone’s here. We’re last."

"Have the Huang family arrived?"

"Yes, two of them."

Su Nantian knew little about the Huang family but recalled from Song Lichen’s files that they had two heirs, restricted to males.

As the Wu family’s representative greeted them, Su Nantian recognized him—a man who had knocked him out at Wu You’er’s university.

"Welcome, young master and lady," the man said. "Everyone is in the hall. I came to greet you."

While Nan Gong Ping and Yuyan exchanged pleasantries, Su Nantian asked Wang Meng, "Who is he?"

Song Lichen’s files listed key clan figures but omitted this man.

Wang Meng, more familiar with the clans, whispered, "He’s Wu family’s adopted son, Wu Jingzhong. Though called an adoptee, he’s a bodyguard like us. His status is slightly better."

Su Nantian understood: Wu Jingzhong was a high-ranking guard, explaining his combat skills.

As they entered the Wu family’s grand hall, Su Nantian noted its opulence—modern and luxurious.

Yet the room was filled with people, divided into factions. Su Nantian recognized only a few from Song Lichen’s list.
