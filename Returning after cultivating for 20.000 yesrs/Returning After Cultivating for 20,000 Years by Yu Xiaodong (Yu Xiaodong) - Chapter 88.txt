“Alright, I understand. Today we’ll return to Hangcheng first; there are other plans ahead. You can rest a bit, it’s been hard work.” Su Nantian replied to Qi Yeyu and others via message. Previously, he had already stated that he regarded QI Yinzhen and Qi Yeyu as brothers, so naturally, he would not treat them like subordinates.

Chapter 427: Succession

After returning to Hangcheng, Su Nantian did not rest but immediately organized people to spread the news that Dihao Group’s bidding failed, with Li Hounian as the culprit.

Su Nantian showed no restraint; in fact, he wanted this matter to be known by all—especially the high-ranking officials within Dihao Group—to achieve his goal of intimidating them.

However, he would never openly admit it was his doing. He even deliberately scolded Li Hounian, Wang Ruichang, and Zhang Feng in front of them for letting the secret slip.

“Since the matter has been exposed, we can’t wait any longer. I had planned to return to Hangcheng and stabilize things for a few days before handling this, as the business handover with Li Hounian was complicated. But now we must start today.”

Su Nantian’s excuse was legitimate, allowing him to immediately begin his plan.

In truth, he intentionally performed his acting so clumsily because the people who knew about the island city bidding were only Li Hounian, Zhang Feng, and himself. Additionally, Wen Ran was involved.

Of course, there were also agents from the Shadow Assassins, unknown to Li Hounian.

Thus, only Li Hounian and the two others knew the details. Naturally, Li Hounian would not spread this information; Wang Ruichang and Zhang Feng also understood it was impossible for the other to leak it. The information must have come from Su Nantian’s side.

Yet, they still had to act out a scene in front of him, making it seem like the secret was leaked.

Zhang Feng inwardly sneered: “Su Nantian, that kid is truly skilled. He’s shifted the blame onto us. I can’t stay here anymore; if I do, I’ll eventually be played by Su Nantian. I need to find a chance to contact someone else soon.”

Zhang Feng’s intention was clear—Li Hounian’s situation had made Dihao Group no longer a place for him. If he stayed, he would inevitably become the next Li Hounian.

Moreover, Zhang Feng managed a business segment; it was impossible to avoid siphoning profits. But with Su Nantian’s approach, how could he continue? Even when Leng Boxiong was in charge, he turned a blind eye. But with so much income lost to Dihao Group, it was utterly meaningless.

Yet Zhang Feng had decided: he would not resign cleanly. After all, his position allowed him to easily access Dihao Group’s financial reports—information that was a massive treasure whether he kept it or sold it.

“Alright, you two can return to your posts. There’s no need for you here. Take care of organizing, and I’ll send someone to handle the business handover.”

Su Nantian waved his hand, dismissing Zhang Feng and Wang Ruichang. In truth, he had clearly noticed Zhang Feng’s eyes were off. But it wasn’t yet time; although he was 100% certain Zhang Feng had ulterior motives, he would not act rashly without solid evidence.

Meanwhile, Su Nantian had already dispatched Qi Yinzhen to meet him in disguise.

To be honest, Master Yao’s craftsmanship was quite good. At first, Su Nantian had to do it himself, but Qi Yinzhen said there was no need to trouble Su Nantian. Master Yao was also skilled in this area; they often used disguises during missions and had never been discovered.

When Qi Yinzhen appeared before Su Nantian with a completely new face, Su Nantian finally believed it. Simply by looking at the face, one couldn’t distinguish authenticity. But for Su Nantian, this wasn’t a problem; when he could not discern someone’s identity by sight, he relied on his senses. He could feel the power and aura from Qi Yinzhen—a practitioner’s more rigorous approach.

A person’s appearance could change, even without disguises—through plastic surgery alone. But their aura would not drastically shift unless they underwent significant changes over a period. Even then, it wouldn’t be entirely altered.

“Chairman, you called me.” Qi Yinzhen now had a different appearance. He wore a suit, glasses, and a large mole on his lip, looking entirely unlike a good guy. He resembled the villains in TV dramas.

His voice had also changed slightly, but Li Hounian, who had only met him once, could still be deceived.

“Xiao Zhang, you’re here. Good. This is your senior, Li Hounian. From today on, you’ll take over all the business department’s affairs—nothing missed, understood?”

After that, Su Nantian turned to Li Hounian: “You understand. Do what needs doing. If you want to do it properly, don’t play games with me.”

“I understand. You can rest easy,” Li Hounian nodded quickly.

Thus, Qi Yinzhen and Li Hounian left. Su Nantian had no doubts about Qi Yinzhen; with his intelligence and perceptiveness, he would not be deceived by Li Hounian. This matter was now concluded. Next, Su Nantian needed to clear the second obstacle for Wen Ran—Zhang Feng.

Of course, defeating Li Hounian and Zhang Feng did not mean there were no threats left in Dihao Group. There were always opponents within a company.

But these two aspects were essential for Wen Ran to obtain: one was business resources and connections, the other financial control—two vital lifelines of a company group. Only by fully mastering these could one truly manipulate Dihao Group.

That was why Li Hounian had so recklessly leaked the bidding information, even though the entire bid was a fake. It proved Li Hounian felt no restraint in his position, believing he could handle the situation himself. But he had no idea it was a trap set by Su Nantian from the beginning—everything was part of a plan.

Chapter 428: An Unexpected Event

The following days, Dihao Group remained calm. Su Nantian had not yet initiated the next step; with Li Hounian’s precedent, he could not act too quickly—otherwise, it would be like scaring the snake. He needed to let Zhang Feng feel less dangerous.

Otherwise, due to Li Hounian’s incident, Zhang Feng would be more cautious and unlikely to fall into the trap immediately.

Wen Ran continued managing Dihao Group, while Su Nantian remained outside to further set the trap.

In Hangcheng, Su Nantian’s influence was neither large nor small. He knew he shouldn’t be too showy, especially with his role in the Dragon Group. Before doing anything, he had to think carefully and avoid standing out too much. Thus, if Wen Ran could act, she would; for other matters, there were the Shadow Assassins and Zhang Bao.

This time, Su Nantian found Zhang Bao himself—personally visiting him. Zhang Bao was lounging by the swimming pool, sipping a drink.

“Zhang Bao, you’re living quite comfortably. It’s been a while since I’ve seen you. You seem to be enjoying yourself.” Su Nantian approached and patted Zhang Bao’s shoulder.

Zhang Bao jolted, almost spitting out his drink. He hadn’t expected Su Nantian to appear suddenly.

Su Nantian’s return to Hangcheng was known, and he had even called Su Nantian to inquire. But Su Nantian hadn’t asked Zhang Bao to come over, so he had waited anxiously.

But for the past few days, Su Nantian had avoided scaring Zhang Feng, so he had taken a few days of peace. Zhang Bao had been unusually carefree.

Unexpectedly, Su Nantian himself arrived today.

In truth, Su Nantian felt the past few days had been too leisurely, so he hadn’t called Zhang Bao via phone but came in person—just to move around. This had startled Zhang Bao.

“Big brother, why did you come in person? Just call me and I’ll handle it. Why go through the trouble of coming yourself?” Zhang Bao quickly stood up, offering Su Nantian a seat and asking his subordinates to bring him a new chair.

“Nothing, don’t be nervous. I just had some free time and came out for a walk. I remembered there was something to do, so I came in person. It’s good for exercise.” Su Nantian smiled and took the drink from his subordinate, sipping it happily.

“You really are living well, brother. Sipping drinks and swimming—very good.” Su Nantian wasn’t mocking; he truly thought it was great. After all, he had been busy with tasks without a moment’s rest recently. Even if he wanted to take Wen Ran out for fun, she had to manage Dihao Group—no one could accompany him.

“Haha, big brother, what’s the task? I’ll definitely complete it.” Zhang Bao said while patting his chest.

“Actually…” Su Nantian had just started speaking when a subordinate of Zhang Bao rushed in.

“Big brother!”

“What’s the matter? Why are you so urgent? Can’t you see the big brother is here! You really are… whatever, talk later!” Zhang Bao waved his hand and said. At this moment, no matter what the issue was, it wasn’t as important as Su Nantian assigning him a task. Doing other things now would be suicidal.

“But big brother… this…” The subordinate didn’t leave but stammered, looking at Su Nantian with hesitation.

Zhang Bao saw this and became anxious—this subordinate was usually obedient, especially among street gangs where hierarchy was crucial. If this subordinate didn’t obey, it would be a disgrace.

Zhang Bao kicked him and said: “Don’t move! I told you the big brother has a task for me. How could you be so blind!”

“No, big brother, this matter is related to the big brother. I have to say it!” The subordinate clutched his stomach, which Zhang Bao had kicked, and said quickly. This subordinate was quite stubborn; even after being kicked, he still dared to speak.

Su Nantian saw this and heard the words, so he immediately said: “Enough, Zhang Bao. Don’t yell at him. Let’s hear what it is first—it seems urgent.”

Su Nantian spoke, and Zhang Bao naturally obeyed. He immediately changed his expression: “Speak!”

The subordinate nodded quickly and said: “Today we went to the school to find some subordinates, but saw Miss Wu You’er being harassed by someone. It’s definitely not an ordinary person; they wanted to take Miss Wu You’er away. The school security came, but then a certain headmaster arrived and ignored the situation. Our subordinates are still in conflict. I rushed back to inform you.”

“What did you say! Zhang Bao, hurry and drive me there!” Su Nantian heard this and didn’t even scold anyone.

This subordinate had rushed back immediately, intending to inform Zhang Bao to tell Su Nantian. Since they were of this level and hadn’t met Su Nantian before, he had no idea. But he had to say it even if Zhang Bao kicked him.

Zhang Bao was stunned; he had almost made a mistake. If this subordinate hadn’t insisted, when Su Nantian found out, he would have had no heads left.

Zhang Bao quickly grabbed the car keys and followed Su Nantian out, rushing toward Wu You’er’s university. They ran through several red lights; the usual twenty-minute drive took only seven minutes.

The university didn’t allow cars, so Su Nantian grabbed the subordinate who had returned to inform him and said: “Come on, I’ll take you running. Tell me where they found her!”

Then Su Nantian actually grabbed the person’s collar and ran, his speed far beyond that of an ordinary person.

Zhang Bao quickly followed with the subordinate.

At this moment, Su Nantian was very anxious. He had failed to protect Wu You’er’s parents before, letting them be taken by the Wu family. He couldn’t let Wu You’er be unprotected now. Otherwise, how could he face Wu You’er’s parents? So Su Nantian must protect Wu You’er this time.

Even if the people who came were from the Wu family, he would not retreat. He must protect her well because Wu You’er’s parents had told him before leaving, not to let Wu You’er get involved in the Wu family’s conflicts. They wanted her to live a carefree life as an ordinary person.

Chapter 429: Wu Family Comes
Su Nantian followed the subordinate and finally found Wu You’er. At that moment, she was by the school’s playground, surrounded completely by black-clad men.

Su Nantian immediately let go of the subordinate and rushed into the crowd, standing beside Wu You’er.

“Wu You’er, are you alright? Who are these people? Why are they causing trouble for you?” Su Nantian asked urgently, while scanning Wu You’er to check if she was injured.

Wu You’er shook her head and looked at Su Nantian with an odd expression. This was the first time Su Nantian had seen her look at him like that.

“What’s wrong with you? Why are you looking at me like this? Is there something you want to say?” Su Nantian was confused. He didn’t know what the situation was. These black-clad men were here for Wu You’er, but they hadn’t attacked her yet.

“Did you lie to me, Su Nantian?” Wu You’er said softly, her tone calm and unsettling.

“Lied to you? When have I ever lied to you? Did they tell you something? Are they trying to stir up trouble between us?” Su Nantian asked, thinking these black-clad men had ill intentions and were trying to stir up trouble between him and Wu You’er.

But Wu You’er didn’t become more peaceful because of Su Nantian’s words; she kept her expression and said: “Where did you say my father and mother went?”

Su Nantian felt a jolt in his heart. He had forgotten this point. Previously, Wu Tao and his wife were taken by the Wu family. Before leaving, they entrusted Su Nantian to take good care of Wu You’er.

At that time, to prevent Wu You’er from being upset, Su Nantian had made a kind lie, saying that Wu Tao had to leave immediately for a high-paying job.

It seemed these black-clad men were from the Wu family, otherwise no one would know why Wu Tao had left.

“I…” Su Nantian was speechless, unsure how to explain, and his brows furrowed.

Wu You’er saw Su Nantian’s expression and nodded, saying: “I understand. You lied to me. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have this expression. Why did you lie? My parents were taken by the Wu family.”

Indeed, after hearing Wu You’er’s words, Su Nantian immediately understood that these people were definitely from the Wu family. They had come to take Wu You’er as well.

“Wu You’er, I didn’t mean to deceive you. When Wu Tao and his wife were taken by the Wu family, I had already reached the airport. I wanted to save them, but they both asked me not to. They said they had their own arrangements in the Wu family and told me to take good care of you. So I lied to you, it was out of necessity because that was their wish.”

Su Nantian could only explain what had happened, not wanting to create a rift with Wu You’er.

“Do you believe me now? Your parents have indeed returned to the Wu family.”

As Su Nantian finished speaking, a voice suddenly came.

A man stepped out from behind the black-clad guards. Su Nantian hadn’t met him before, but he could clearly deduce this man had a connection to the Wu family.

Su Nantian felt angry; this man had been waiting for him all along. He would only believe that Wu Tao and his wife had truly returned to the Wu family after telling Wu You’er.

“Who are you? Why are you looking for Wu You’er?” Su Nantian immediately stood in front of Wu You’er and asked.

“What business is it of yours? Today, there’s nothing for you to do. I’m here to take Wu You’er away.” This man looked at Su Nantian with a dismissive expression, as if looking down on an ordinary person.

“I won’t let Wu You’er go with you. Even if you explain clearly, I still won’t let her go.” After saying this, Su Nantian pulled Wu You’er’s hand and prepared to leave.

But he hadn’t expected Wu You’er to pull her hand away, then whispered: “Su Nantian, I want to see my parents.”

When she turned around, Wu You’er bit her lip with a helpless expression. She didn’t want to disappoint Su Nantian’s kindness, but she also longed to reunite with her parents.

“Your parents entrusted me to take good care of you, not letting you return to the Wu family. They think it’s not suitable for you to live there, and they want you to live a carefree life here. I’ll never have any connection with the Wu family again.” Su Nantian had been frowning and persuading her gently. He understood Wu You’er’s desire to reunite with her parents.

After all, who wouldn’t want to be with their family? Especially Wu You’er’s parents. Who would want to be separated from their children?

“I know, I know they entrusted you before leaving. I also know you’ve protected me well these days. But Su Nantian, I want to be with my family. They’ve returned to the Wu family and their situation is unknown. I don’t know what they’re doing there. As a child, how could I leave them alone? And they’ve always been helpless; I don’t want them to face this alone.”

However, after Wu You’er spoke, the man said: “You don’t need to demonize us. Wu Tao and his wife are doing well there. This time, they’re bringing you back for a reason. Don’t say it’s life or death.”

“Why are you bringing Wu You’er back this time? Tell me.” Su Nantian was angry and asked.

“This is our family’s business, unrelated to you at all. Why are you prying into our family affairs? People like you will never be able to match the Wu family.” This man’s words clearly showed he didn’t know about Wu Lianxing and Su Nantian’s relationship.

He also thought of Su Nantian as an insignificant street thug, unable to match the Wu family.

In terms of family background, Su Nantian didn’t have such a powerful one, but to call him an unknown street thug was definitely wrong. Even if the Wu family clashed with Su Nantian, they might not gain the upper hand; perhaps even be tripped up by him.

This man’s words were clearly provoking Su Nantian.

Chapter 430: Verbal Duel
Su Nantian clearly knew the man before him was provoking him, thinking he could crush him because he was from the Wu family.

“I don’t care who you are, but today I’m here to protect Wu You’er. You can’t take her.” Su Nantian said more resolutely. He had promised Wu Tao and his wife, so he must keep it.

“Kid, you’re really not smart. Do you know the Wu family’s background? How dare you block us? You’ll regret this decision. I’m telling you now, step aside and let me take Wu You’er back to Beijing.” This man hadn’t expected Su Nantian to be so firm. Usually, people would be scared by the number of black-clad men and not get involved in this matter.

But Su Nantian didn’t take his threats seriously; he was even more resolute, standing in front of Wu You’er and saying: “I’ve said it before. I don’t care who you are or what background you have. No one can take Wu You’er from here today.”

Su Nantian’s words were resolute, his eyes full of determination. No one could doubt his decision.

“You really are refusing to take the bait and provoke us Wu family. You’ll have your share of trouble.” Just as this man spoke, Zhang Bao and his men arrived.

Zhang Bao saw that there were indeed many people, with Su Nantian and Wu You’er surrounded. He immediately led the way to push through and stood beside Su Nantian, then ordered his subordinates to form a circle outside, surrounding these people.

“Big brother, are you okay? I’ve brought people; we’ll fight with him.” Zhang Bao knew the other side was definitely strong, but he also knew Su Nantian’s combat skills.

So at this moment, as long as Su Nantian was there, he had no fear. His attitude became even more arrogant.

This man smiled disdainfully and said to Su Nantian: “I see your people have arrived. But I must tell you, no matter how many of you come, it’s nothing compared to our Wu family.”

He even looked back at Zhang Bao’s subordinates outside, his expression of disdain deepened.

“You really are annoying. I tell you not to provoke our big brother, or you’ll regret it!” Zhang Bao, who had once been in the underworld, spoke with authority and looked fierce. His presence was already established.

“Anyway, I must take her today. I advise you not to block me again. Give yourself one more chance to think; if you still persist, I’ll have to act.” This man spoke again coldly, giving Su Nantian a final warning.

And this man didn’t even look at Zhang Bao, completely ignoring him as if he were an insignificant person.

“Don’t need to. I can tell you directly, if you want to take Wu You’er away, you’ll have to step over my body. See if you have the ability.” Su Nantian said this, his eyes even more resolute.

This wasn’t just Wu Tao and his wife’s request; he also knew the Wu family environment was unsuitable for Wu You’er. In such a big family, there were constant intrigues. Wu You’er had grown up carefree like an ordinary child; returning would only make her a target of bullying.

So it wasn’t just for his parents’ request, but also Su Nantian himself wanted Wu You’er to continue living as an ordinary person. For this, he had to ensure that today Wu You’er wouldn’t be taken by the Wu family.

This man nodded and said nothing, then waved his hand to his men. The other西装 bodyguards immediately stepped forward, some of them attacking Su Nantian from both sides. It seemed they were about to attack him.

“No, don’t hit him. I’ll go with you.” Wu You’er suddenly shouted. She didn’t want Su Nantian to be injured for her, and she was also conflicted inside.

She now knew her parents had indeed returned to the Wu family, and she wanted to find them. But at the same time, she knew her parents didn’t want her to come back, so she was conflicted and torn.

“Too late. If you had said this earlier, I might not have let them punish him. But now he has insulted me; I must regain my dignity.” This man shook his head, and no matter what Wu You’er said, it was useless.

“Attack!” This man shouted again, and the bodyguards immediately rushed forward with fists toward Su Nantian.

Su Nantian saw their stance and knew these people were professionals, trained in martial arts. Their moves weren’t like those of a street brawler or simple combat techniques, but had the depth of martial arts.

Su Nantian wouldn’t underestimate them; although he knew his strength could easily crush them, he also wouldn’t look down on these people. Sometimes, many strong warriors lose because of overconfidence. Su Nantian always warned himself against this.

But the gap in strength made it easy for Su Nantian to handle them. These people, though skilled in martial arts, were nothing compared to Su Nantian.

Su Nantian moved like lightning and knocked down the first person rushing toward him. He suddenly felt his back was grabbed by two people, so he leapt into the air and spun around with a roundhouse kick, knocking both of them to the ground.

This scene was too fast for those beside Su Nantian—Zhang Bao and Wu You’er—both of whom were stunned.

These two had known Su Nantian’s strength before, but this was the fastest he had ever moved. It was because this man had angered Su Nantian, making him more serious.

“Haha, I see why you dared to challenge me so confidently before. It turns out you’re a martial artist. I didn’t expect my men to be beaten like this. Seems you have real skills.” This man saw Su Nantian’s every move and immediately made his judgment. He raised his hand, signaling the bodyguards to return.

“I’ve already said it—no matter your background or how many people you have, I won’t let you take Wu You’er today. If you’re smart, leave now.” Su Nantian roared.

Chapter 431: Promise
Su Nantian looked at the man before him and clearly saw he was calling his men to stop, indicating he would fight personally. Also, Su Nantian could tell from this man’s gait and physique that he was also skilled in martial arts.

“Since you refuse to take the bait, I’ll have to fight personally.” Indeed, this man took off his suit jacket and through the undershirt, one could see his fierce muscles.

Su Nantian’s previous assumption was correct—this man was definitely a martial artist. His muscles weren’t like those in the gym who intentionally built them up; they were real, formed through training and combat.

“You still don’t give up? If I could make you give up, I’d be happy. Come at me.” Su Nantian said and turned to signal Zhang Bao to pull Wu You’er aside so she wouldn’t be hurt.

Then Su Nantian adjusted his clothes and stretched his limbs. He knew this man was no ordinary person; he must be someone who had practiced martial arts since childhood. Although Su Nantian wasn’t afraid of him, he could only use his ordinary skills in front of so many people and couldn’t use the techniques from his cultivation.

“Come on!” Su Nantian shouted and waved his finger, signaling the man to attack.

This man smiled with a twist of his mouth and immediately rushed toward Su Nantian, throwing a punch at his face. Su Nantian quickly reacted and blocked the punch with his hand, but he could feel this punch’s power was different from ordinary people. It was stronger.

Even Su Nantian could feel a slight pain in his arm from blocking this punch, which had never happened before. He had fought others and never felt pain because their punches were too weak.

This proved this Wu family man was truly exceptional.

“Good, you’re better than those clowns.” Su Nantian said while easily dodging.

“Just an appetizer, you being able to block it isn’t surprising. But people who can imagine my punch are rare. You’re quite skilled.”

Although their positions were different, they spoke with a touch of admiration. And this was the first time Su Nantian had met someone who could match him in combat.

Of course, this referred to pure martial arts; if Su Nantian used his cultivation abilities, this man would be nothing.

They continued fighting. Because Su Nantian had never before met an opponent who could match him, he intentionally held back a little. He lightened his punches slightly to fight with this man longer.

And in their combat, Su Nantian confirmed this man’s skills were truly good—his techniques varied and his attacks were fierce.

This man suddenly jumped into the air, aiming a kick at Su Nantian’s head. This time, he had held back, but this man used all his strength to attack Su Nantian without hesitation.

This angered Su Nantian, who had been holding back, but the opponent was attacking with all his might. So Su Nantian no longer held back and started to fight seriously.

Zhang Bao, watching from the side, was also quite nervous. He had never seen anyone fight with Su Nantian evenly.

Zhang Bao immediately said to Wu You’er beside him: “Maybe I should have my subordinates take you away first. I didn’t expect the big brother to get into a battle.”

“No, I’m not leaving. I don’t trust Su Nantian.” Wu You’er’s heart was still conflicted. She really wanted to go to Beijing with her parents, and she knew they had told Su Nantian to protect her and not let her go to the Wu family. There must be their reasons.

So now, Wu You’er was very hesitant. She stayed here waiting for a result. If Su Nantian could truly drive these people away, she wouldn’t go to Beijing.

But if this fight ended with Su Nantian’s defeat, she wouldn’t mind going to Beijing.

So Wu You’er had made this battle a bet on whether she would go to Beijing or not. No matter the result, she would accept it happily.

This battle eventually ended quickly. After this man started attacking with all his might, Su Nantian became angry and no longer held back. He responded with a strong intensity.

Su Nantian delivered a final scissors kick, knocking this man down and throwing him to the ground. He didn’t get up for a long time.

“Enough, don’t struggle. You lost.” Su Nantian clapped his hands and said calmly. This result was destined from the beginning, but he hadn’t expected it to be so complicated.

After saying this, Su Nantian didn’t care about the man on the ground and walked over to Zhang Bao and Wu You’er.

“Enough, don’t go to Beijing. Your uncle and aunt told me to make sure you never go there. Listen to them, I know you want to reunite with them, but it’s not a place for you. They decided to let you go—there must be their reasons. I hope you can understand them.”

Su Nantian also knew Wu You’er was still conflicted and hesitant. He used emotional appeals to persuade her.

After saying this, Wu You’er nodded and said politely: “I understand. I’ll listen to you. I won’t go to the Wu family in Beijing. Actually, I made a bet with myself: if you win, I’ll never go to Beijing again. Since your parents have their own ideas, even if I want to, I must respect their wishes. Maybe going there would only cause trouble and make the situation worse.”

At this point, Wu You’er’s eyes clearly showed a touch of disappointment. She had accepted the result but who wouldn’t want to reunite with their family?

Su Nantian sighed and said: “We have some people in Beijing who know us. Plus, your cousin Wu Lianxing and I are connected. I’ll have him check what your uncle and aunt are doing in the Wu family. Don’t worry, I won’t let them be bullied.”

Chapter 432: Preparing to Wrap Up
After hearing Su Nantian’s words, Wu You’er was deeply moved. In truth, she and Su Nantian had only met by chance; without Wu Lianxing, they would have been strangers.

But during this time, she had clearly seen Su Nantian’s actions—helping her and her family. Now with such a big event, involving the Beijing clan, Su Nantian still helped her without hesitation, not fearing trouble. This made Wu You’er very moved.

“Thank you, Su Nantian.” This was the first time Wu You’er had sincerely thanked Su Nantian. These words made Su Nantian a bit embarrassed.

“Enough, no need for thanks between us. I said it and did it; you can rest easy. I won’t let you see your uncle and aunt for life. They’ve returned to Beijing, and there must be something they’re doing. I still have unfinished business in Hangcheng, but it’ll be resolved soon. I’ll definitely go to Beijing to check.”

Su Nantian scratched his head and said, but at this moment, because he and Wu You’er were so engrossed in their conversation, they hadn’t felt a force coming from behind.

“Big brother, be careful!” At this moment, Zhang Bao returned after instructing his subordinates and saw the man attacking Su Nantian. He immediately shouted.
