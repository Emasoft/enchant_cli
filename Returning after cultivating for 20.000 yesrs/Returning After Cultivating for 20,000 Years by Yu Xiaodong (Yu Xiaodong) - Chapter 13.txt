“Is this not fake? What exactly was stuffed inside?”

Su Nantian gazed at Zhang Xue with profound bewilderment as she vanished into the distance.

At that moment, tears streamed down Zhang Xue’s face as she lay upon Feng Yue’s back. She had never imagined that this lecher would sacrifice his life to save her.

A pang of regret stirred within her—why had she harbored such resentment toward him before? Though he had glimpsed her private parts.

If Zhang Xue knew Su Nantian’s thoughts at that moment, she would have gone mad.

After exiting the car factory, a thunderous explosion echoed from within. The image of Su Nantian reduced to flesh and bone, his remains scattered, made Zhang Xue faint.

Wu Jun chuckled heartily from a distance. “Su Nantian, no one will save you this time.”

Everyone else fled outward.

Then came a more violent explosion, and the car factory collapsed with a roar. Flames surged outward like a dragon’s breath, instantly engulfing an area of more than ten meters.

The surrounding patrolmen watched the terrifying scene with lingering fear.

Feng Yue sighed sorrowfully, another promising youth perishing in the inferno.

“Captain, I think we should commend him,” Wu Jun stepped forward from the crowd, his heart brimming with joy. No one would vie for Zhang Xue anymore.

“Yes, he deserves commendation.”

“Captain, let me assist Zhang Xue.”

Wu Jun extended his hands, greedily eyeing the pale skin revealed by Zhang Xue’s torn clothes and the faint outline of her bra. His mind burned with desire.

“Feng Yue, where is my daughter?”

A thunderous roar echoed from behind. A man strode forward with the gait of a dragon and the might of a tiger—Zhang Xiaotian, deputy commander of Fengcheng’s patrol unit. Upon hearing the explosion and seeing the fire, his heart sank in despair. The chance of his daughter surviving was slim.

If anything befell his only child, he would not forgive Feng Yue.

Hearing the voice, Wu Jun’s outstretched hands retracted as if electrocuted. His body retreated, blending back into the crowd like he had never stepped forward.

The crowd parted instantly.

Feng Yue’s face darkened—Zhang Xiaotian was notoriously hot-tempered.

Indeed, a sharp crack rang out. A resounding slap struck Feng Yue’s face, leaving a crimson handprint.

He scooped up his daughter, draping his own clothes over her.

“Doctor! Quick, a doctor!”

Seeing his daughter still alive, though battered, his heart eased slightly.

“Pray she is unharmed, or I shall peel your skin off,” Zhang Xiaotian glared at Feng Yue.

Now he regretted entrusting Zhang Xue to him.

“Then who do you intend to peel?”

The voice trailed off, and another deep, anxious tone followed—more intimidating than Zhang Xiaotian’s roar.

All turned toward the source.

A plain middle-aged man strode forward, not part of the patrol unit.

Zhang Xiaotian was about to protest but halted mid-sentence upon seeing the man’s face.

“Mr. Gao, what brings you here?” He approached with a smile.

Feng Yue was astonished—who was this man to command such deference from Zhang Xiaotian?

Wu Jun puzzled—why had his anger vanished so swiftly?

The crowd, too, was bewildered, instinctively retreating to avoid collateral damage.

“Hurry and take your useless crew to rescue people! What are you all standing here for?”

“If anyone inside suffers, you’ll each owe ten lives.”

Gao Peng was both terrified and anxious. The girl’s illness had just shown hope, yet this boy must not perish. Though he was unsure of Su Nantian’s true strength, the explosion left him uncertain whether Su Nantian was alive.

He knew that if it were himself, death would be certain.

“Yes! Hurry and put out the fire! Don’t you want to keep your jobs?” Zhang Xiaotian nodded repeatedly, barking orders.

He had last seen Gao Peng at the chief’s home, where the chief had shown him utmost respect. That alone made him take Gao Peng seriously.

Few could command the chief’s reverence—more accurately, fear.

Later, the chief had told him one thing: “From now on, do as he says. The Gao family is a mountain in Fengcheng.”

Chapter 56: Clothes Burned Again

Unexpectedly, their reunion was in this setting.

If anyone inside perished, the consequences were unbearable.

Some donned fireproof suits; others rushed back to their cars for extinguishers. The crowd stirred immediately.

Wu Jun slipped into the throng, retreating—he had no desire to rescue that scoundrel.

But soon, those who had intended to rush into the fire halted.

“What are you all standing here for? Get inside!”

Zhang Xiaotian, seeing the hesitant crowd, grew frantic. He feared angering Gao Peng.

“Captain Zhang, it seems someone is emerging from inside!”

The man in the fireproof suit trembled, pointing at a shadow slowly stepping out of the inferno.

The crowd gaped in horror—this defied explanation. They hadn’t even entered yet, and the heat was already unbearable.

“What!”

Zhang Xiaotian stepped forward, confirming the sight.

Like a devil returning from hell, he had never seen anyone so composed in fire—fire was not water.

Zhang Xiaotian could no longer remain calm. Indeed, the chief’s discernment was remarkable; those connected to the Gao family were no ordinary people.

Gao Peng’s heart swelled with joy—Su Nantian’s strength had once again exceeded his expectations.

The stronger Su Nantian was, the more the Gao family benefited. This youth truly stood out; he had grown increasingly impressed by his father’s judgment.

Gao Peng immediately approached, stripping off his own clothes to offer them.

Zhang Xiaotian was stunned—what kind of man would remove his own clothes to give?

Almost simultaneously, others mimicked the gesture.

Su Nantian sighed in frustration—yet again burned, and the clothes were of such poor quality.

“Thank you.” He first took Zhang Xiaotian’s clothes to cover his modesty, then draped Gao Peng’s over himself.

With so many people surrounding him, he had no habit of running naked.

He needed to acquire a fireproof garment—perhaps even fireproof undergarments!

Meanwhile, Feng Yue was speechless. Though he knew Su Nantian’s strength had defeated the top ten killers, why was there not a single scar on him? That bomb had exploded directly on him—yet not even a speck of ash remained. His skin was spotless, as if freshly washed.

Wu Jun had already slipped away silently.

“Mr. Gao, you know what to do with those people, right?” Su Nantian glanced at Gao Peng coldly.

“Rest assured, everything is under control,” Gao Peng said confidently.

Su Nantian surveyed his attire.

“Cough, cough—this was just an accident, an accident.” Gao Peng smiled, then dialed a phone.

Far above, a helicopter exploded into fragments.

“Mr. Gao, no need to be tense. I simply dislike being watched—just a joke.”

“Haha, Mr. Su speaks humorously. Oh, by the way, your items have been partially found. However, a few are still hard to locate; we’ll need several more days.”

“No problem. A few more days are acceptable,” Su Nantian smiled.

He turned to Feng Yue.

“How is Zhang Xue? Is she alright?”

“She’s fine—just fainted. She’s receiving treatment on the medical vehicle.”

Feng Yue snapped back to reality, hurriedly replied.

Zhang Xiaotian was stunned by Gao Peng’s address of the young man. “Mr. Su,” “you”—each title conveyed reverence for this youth.

Only someone truly exceptional would be treated thus by the Gao family.

When he heard this young man concern himself with his daughter, Zhang Xiaotian first felt confusion, then relief.

If his daughter could be with this young man, his role as a father would be fulfilled—his future was boundless.

“Thank you for your concern, Mr. Su.” He said immediately.

“Ah, I see. Your daughter, then? My apologies for the clothes…”

Su Nantian awkwardly glanced down.

“No problem, Mr. Su. If you’re not offended, I have pants as well.”

Zhang Xiaotian hurried to remove his trousers.

“Oh, no need for that. Let’s go check on your daughter.”

Su Nantian quickly stopped him; he had no habit of wearing another man’s pants. If it were a beauty, perhaps he might consider it.

“Captain Feng, have your people leave first.”

“Retreat.”

The group approached the medical vehicle.

“Deputy Captain Zhang, Zhang Xue is fine—just startled. She’ll wake soon,” a doctor said.

Su Nantian’s eyes lit up upon seeing the doctor.

“Do you have an extra white coat? I need one.”

He could not allow Gao Peng and Zhang Xiaotian to remain bare-chested.

“Yes, yes.” The doctor quickly handed over a white coat.

Su Nantian passed the upper garment to Gao Peng, then glanced down.

“Perhaps you should change inside the vehicle?”

Seeing Su Nantian’s awkwardness, Zhang Xiaotian quickly suggested.

Su Nantian entered the medical vehicle and closed the door. He removed his lower garment, preparing to put on the white coat—when Zhang Xue awoke, staring at him with wide eyes, her mouth slowly opening.

Su Nantian rushed to her side, covering her mouth with one hand.

“Shh. Don’t speak—your father is outside.”

Why had she woken at this moment? If her father misunderstood, it would be impossible to clear his name.

Su Nantian turned around, swiftly pulling the white coat over himself, concealing his vital areas.

When he looked back at Zhang Xue, her face was crimson.

“Now, lie down and feign unconsciousness. I’ll go out.”

Zhang Xue first shook her head violently, then nodded rapidly, lying back down and closing her eyes.

The only difference was her flushed face.

Zhang Xue cursed Su Nantian internally, regretting he hadn’t been burned to death.

Su Nantian opened the back door and leapt out, handing the clothes to Zhang Xiaotian.

“I just examined your daughter; I think it’s better to go to the hospital for a checkup.”

Zhang Xiaotian was puzzled. Did he take advantage of the situation to flirt with his daughter?

Gao Peng explained, “Mr. Su is a master physician.”

Zhang Xiaotian had no doubts and immediately boarded the medical vehicle, driving off.

Not long after, Lin Suyun hurriedly arrived. Seeing Su Nantian alive, she rushed to embrace him tightly.

Lin Suyun’s eyes glistened. Since seeing the online reports, she had called Su Nantian but found him unreachable—she had been frantic.

Though she had witnessed his strength, she still worried.

“You know, I thought you were dead.” Her tension eased as she felt his warmth.

Chapter 57: The Sword is About to Drawn

“Don’t worry, no one can harm me.” Su Nantian patted her back. He had intended to comfort her, but his body suddenly felt like a powder keg.

It was summer; both wore thin clothes. Su Nantian had only a white coat on, leaving his undergarments completely exposed.

He clearly felt something flatten beneath him, yet it was elastic and rebounding.

Unimaginable—lying down, the mountain still stood tall, lush, deep, and dense.

Thinking of it sent a wave of heat through him; the temperature beneath him rose rapidly.

Like a sword not fully drawn, its dimensions remained unknown. Perhaps it was a broken blade, or an unpolished sword—perhaps even one that radiated coldness before it had been drawn, so sharp it defied imagination.

No one knew what kind of sword it was until tested.

Soon, Lin Suyun felt Su Nantian’s oddness and blushed instantly. She glanced at Gao Peng, who was watching them, then buried her head in Su Nantian’s chest.

“Let’s go check on the new house.”

Su Nantian froze, sensing something amiss. This body was too sensitive.

He immediately channeled his internal energy downward to suppress the fire, but it backfired—his energy flowed like oil, intensifying the flames.

Su Nantian was bewildered. Why had this happened?

It made no sense—why hadn’t it occurred when he treated Yao Lina before?

Perhaps this cultivation method had hidden drawbacks.

Like Wei Ge’s invention, it concealed unknown secrets.

This still didn’t make sense—if such drawbacks existed, they wouldn’t have been forgotten in the mountains.

He clearly remembered that he had accidentally fallen into a ravine while searching for an herb, which was fortunate—he had landed in the river and saved his life.

There, by the shore stood a dilapidated pavilion creaking with each gust of wind, as if one breeze could topple it. Yet it swayed but remained standing.

At that time, he had just broken through the innate realm. Curiosity led him to explore it briefly. In an unassuming corner, he discovered this cultivation method, covered in dust as if discarded.

He remembered the bold first line: “Absorb the essence of heaven and earth, dominate all things.”

The method was simple and clear, covering only the initial stages of cultivation and the innate realm. But there was a prerequisite: one must start from scratch, which he could not accept.

After breaking through the innate realm with great effort, how could he switch to another method? He had discarded it into his storage space, nearly forgotten.

If not for Earth’s sparse spiritual energy, he wouldn’t have chosen this method. He had intended to quickly reach the innate realm and then switch, but now he needed to study it carefully.

Pushing aside his thoughts, Su Nantian replied, “Okay.”

Without looking back, he greeted Gao Peng and was dragged away by Lin Suyun.

They got into the car, passing a clothing store. They parked nearby.

Lin Suyun blushed and said, “I’ll buy you a new set of clothes.”

She opened the door and stepped out.

“Oops, he must have noticed,” Su Nantian thought, feeling his lower region—luckily, the fire had subsided. As long as he didn’t touch Lin Suyun for now, there should be no problem.

Knock knock.

The sound of knocking on the car window interrupted Su Nantian’s thoughts. He rolled down the window, hearing a familiar voice.

“Sir, could you move the car slightly?”

Wu Lianxing knocked on the window. Upon recognizing the person inside, she was surprised.

Unexpectedly meeting Su Nantian here—had this man forgotten his promise to teach her techniques?

“Ah, it’s you,” Su Nantian was surprised. He hadn’t expected to meet Wu Lianxing here, suddenly recalling his promise to her.

“Why so quickly? Have you forgotten me already?”

Wu Lianxing said this casually, but immediately regretted it—there was an unspoken implication.

Yet she still caught Su Nantian’s fleeting expression of surprise—yes, it was genuine.

A woman’s intuition never failed; she felt a strange disappointment.

“No, no—let’s set a time to teach you the techniques.”

Su Nantian rubbed his nose.

“Okay, how about eight tonight at Moonlight Teahouse? It’s quiet and has good soundproofing.”

Wu Lianxing, upon hearing he would teach her techniques, instantly felt better. She didn’t even notice the sentence.

“Okay, no problem.” As Su Nantian’s words ended, another voice echoed outside.

“Lianxing, why so long? What are you doing at the teahouse? It needs good soundproofing.”

A girl in a white top and denim skirt approached, her long legs wrapped in flesh-colored stockings. She reached out to pinch Wu Lianxing’s waist, smiling mischievously as if discovering her secret.

“Bai Qiuyue, stop fooling around. He’s just a friend.”

Wu Lianxing blushed, regretting her words—what she had said could be misinterpreted.

“Really? Then introduce him properly. Oh, he’s a doctor too. Not bad-looking.”

Bai Qiuyue looked at Su Nantian inside the car, her eyes lighting up.

“Su Gongzi, this is my best friend, Bai Qiuyue.”

Wu Lianxing introduced her, then cast a slightly resentful glance at Bai Qiuyue.

“Hello, Su Nantian.”

They shook hands.

“We’re going to the teahouse to discuss musical techniques,” Wu Lianxing explained.

“Alright, no need to explain. I understand everything.”

Bai Qiuyue smiled knowingly, as if she had seen through it all.

“Never mind, we’ll go now.”

Wu Lianxing decided not to explain further—more explanations would only make it worse. She greeted Bai Qiuyue and left quickly.

Move the car?

Suddenly, he remembered he didn’t even have a driver’s license. Fortunately, he had seen Lin Suyun drive before—probably no problem.

He sat in the driver’s seat, started the engine, pulled up the handbrake, and stepped on the accelerator smoothly—like an experienced driver.

After moving the car, he switched seats. Su Nantian saw Lin Suyun rushing out with two bags.

“Here, your clothes. I don’t understand why you’re always burned. Seems like I need to have a fireproof suit made for you.”

Lin Suyun joked, but thinking of their embrace earlier, she felt a strange tension.

Su Nantian took the clothes and glanced at them—underwear and a set of clothes.

A woman’s underwear, the first he had ever received.

The process of buying clothes would surely be awkward—like a man buying women’s underwear and sanitary pads.

After a long silence, Su Nantian finally spoke: “Thank you.”

Lin Suyun said nothing.

The atmosphere was awkward.

Chapter 58: Is This About to Eat Me?

Neither spoke again, and they soon arrived at Fengyue Community.

They found a parking spot and slowly stopped the car.

Lin Suyun broke the silence first: “Are you changing here or going up?”

Su Nantian looked at his white coat and said, “Inside the car.”

The long white coat covered the essential areas; no one would see anything.

Lin Suyun nodded and stepped out of the car, pacing back and forth outside, lost in thought.

Su Nantian took out the underwear Lin Suyun had bought and, inexplicably, sniffed it.

He detected a faint fragrance.

Yet his body showed no reaction.

No more thoughts, he quickly put on the clothes.

They fit perfectly—neither too tight nor too loose.

After dressing, Su Nantian noticed his bare feet.

Never mind.

He looked in the mirror and nodded in satisfaction.

Still as handsome as ever.

Shoes were irrelevant!

Su Nantian stepped out of the car and asked Lin Suyun, “Are you okay? Suyun.”

Lin Suyun blushed and shook her head.

“Are the furnishings all there upstairs?” Su Nantian asked.

“Yes.”

“That’s good. I’ll go buy groceries; you wait upstairs.” Su Nantian rubbed his nose and added, “By the way, I don’t have cash. Could you give me some?”

Lin Suyun took out her wallet and handed him two hundred-yuan bills. She turned and entered the building without saying more.

Su Nantian felt strange—Lin Suyun was different from usual, quieter. Normally, she would mock him.

He shook his head and ignored it, walking toward the supermarket he had seen earlier.

If someone crouched to examine his feet carefully, they would notice that the barefoot pair had no contact with the ground.

Su Nantian wandered through the supermarket, finding it outrageously expensive—prices were over double outside, and there were many people.

With the two hundred-yuan bills in his hand, he could barely buy anything. He bought a few vegetables, eggs, and noodles—already spent all his money.

Even the thought of buying shoes was abandoned.

Su Nantian left the supermarket under everyone’s surprised glances.

Soon, he returned to his newly bought house.

“Suyun, I’ll cook for you,” Su Nantian held up the items he had bought.

Upon hearing this ambiguous statement, Lin Suyun’s mind returned to the embrace earlier.

Though she knew Su Nantian meant noodles, her face still uncontrollably blushed, and her heart quickened.

“I’ll take a shower.”

Su Nantian looked at Lin Suyun’s back, puzzled.

Was there a problem with “eating below”?

Su Nantian surveyed the expensive house, appreciating how affluent people enjoyed life.

All appliances were top brands; home network coverage was complete. Even the curtains could be controlled with a word—opening, closing, and adjusting transparency automatically.

The spacious kitchen pleased him greatly.

Soon, two bowls of steaming noodles were ready.

At the same time, Lin Suyun emerged from the bathroom in a bathrobe, her snow-white chest exposed as if unaware.

Su Nantian had intended to remind her but stopped himself.

“This is your noodles? Two eggs, one vegetable, and those thin noodles,” Lin Suyun said with a meaningful tone.

Su Nantian heard no dissatisfaction, only a subtle teasing undertone.

Lin Suyun parted her lips and took a strand of noodles, slowly placing it in her mouth.

Su Nantian said nothing but watched the scene, his confusion deepening. Could she be preparing to eat me?

After finishing the noodles, he glanced at the clock—7 o’clock.

“Suyun, you eat first; I have something to do outside and might return late.”

Without waiting for Lin Suyun’s reply, he rushed out.

He feared staying longer would make him unable to resist eating Lin Suyun. Clearly, she wasn’t ready yet, and he hadn’t figured out why his body had reacted this way.

He decided to temporarily leave Lin Suyun alone.

Su Nantian walked outside, feeling his pocket.

It seemed he would have to walk—fortunately, he had asked earlier and it wasn’t far.

Soon, Su Nantian reached the Moonlight Teahouse. As he prepared to enter, his bare feet caught the attention of two security guards at the entrance.

Su Nantian sighed and waited for Wu Lianxing to arrive.

At that moment, a BMW pulled up. A young man in an Armani suit stepped out, followed by a black-clad bodyguard.

He glanced at Su Nantian with disdain.

“Are these your new security guards? How could they not even have shoes?”

“Mr. Yang, this man couldn’t possibly be a new security guard. Look at his frail appearance—how could he be our opponent? He doesn’t even have shoes and claims to be invited by Miss Wu.” One security guard smiled.

“Miss Wu would never know someone without shoes—this is a fraud,” another security guard added, smiling.

Wu Lianxing was a regular at the teahouse; they remembered her clearly. Seeing this man, it felt like defiling their goddess.

“Then why are you letting him stand here? Drive him away immediately.”

Hearing he was invited by Wu Lianxing, his expression instantly turned disdainful and deeply contemptuous.

Like seeing a fly.

He had pursued Wu Lianxing for a long time but hadn’t been invited yet. If not for learning she would be here, he wouldn’t have hurried over.

“Yes, Mr. Yang, we’re about to drive him away.”

The two security guards were delighted—such an opportunity to please Mr. Yang. If they could make him happy, they might gain some benefits.

They surrounded Su Nantian from both sides. One struck his abdomen with a fist, while the other prepared to grab his neck from behind.

Their attacks were swift and ruthless, with a hint of cruelty.

Seeing Su Nantian’s dazed expression, they felt triumphant.

Clearly trained professionals.

Su Nantian’s lips curled slightly.

As their fists approached, he took a step sideways and escaped the attack.

The two security guards’ punches landed on each other, emitting a painful cry.

Their fists had been so fierce that they couldn’t retract—watching them hit each other.

They were astonished why the man had suddenly vanished.

They rushed forward again, thinking it was a coincidence.

Before they could reach him, their vision blurred—sudden force struck their abdomens, sending them flying backward.

“Useless waste.”

Chapter 59: Kneel and Apologize

“Mr. Yang, I’ll handle this one,” said the man behind Zhang Kun.

“Zhang Kun, teach him a lesson.”

“Hmph, kid, you’ve offended Mr. Yang—kneel and apologize.”

Zhang Kun raised an eyebrow, radiating a terrifying aura toward Su Nantian.

The two security guards felt this pressure and retreated far back, exclaiming: “Wushen! He’s from Fengyue University’s Wudao Society.”

That was a place they had longed to enter.

“Hmph, two useless men, yet you have some insight.”

Zhang Kun was satisfied with their reaction.

He looked at Su Nantian’s calm face and frowned.

He disliked this expression, feeling ignored.

“Maybe you should kneel and apologize to me,” Su Nantian said coldly.

“You don’t know the sky or earth, do you? You know Fengyue University’s Wudao Society has real masters, not like other schools’ fake showpieces,” one security guard mocked.

“Fengyue University’s Wudao Society—anyone can fight ten of us. Your two moves were so weak, even Zhang Kun doesn’t need to act.”

Another security guard saw more than ten people coming out of the teahouse and felt emboldened. If he could perform well in front of Zhang Kun, maybe he would learn a few moves.

“Brothers, it’s this kid causing trouble at the entrance—beat him thoroughly.”

As he finished speaking, two security guards suddenly felt themselves flying and collided with their comrades.

“Interesting.” Zhang Kun smiled mischievously at the scene.

At the moment Su Nantian’s two security guards were thrown, he moved.

He swung his fist toward Su Nantian’s face, sending a sharp gust of wind—his speed was astonishingly fast, almost instantly arriving.

The security guards stared wide-eyed; they only saw a fist shadow flickering in the air, like an arrow shot from a bow. The air seemed to be cut apart.

They were certain this punch would shatter his face, breaking bones and leaving him disfigured.

He was too handsome to be destroyed—this would be perfect.

“Stop!”

A woman’s voice echoed from afar.

Hearing Wu Lianxing’s voice, Mr. Yang quickly raised his hand to stop them—he didn’t want to anger Wu Lianxing.

Zhang Kun saw Mr. Yang’s gesture and halted his fist one centimeter from Su Nantian’s face, the wind blowing his hair.

Seeing Su Nantian still with a neutral expression, he smiled coldly.

Wu Lianxing stepped in front of Su Nantian, confronting Mr. Yang: “Yang Yan, what right do you have to bully my friend?”

“What? He’s your friend? Haha. Lianxing, are you joking? This man without shoes—how could he be your friend?”

Yang Yan sneered, his words full of mockery.

“Yes, he is my friend. And you have no right to call me Lianxing. We’re not even friends.”

Wu Lianxing straightened her chest, spreading her arms to shield Su Nantian.

“Wu Lianxing, I didn’t expect your taste to be so low—friends with a man without shoes. I’ve given you flowers and gifts every day, yet you never considered me a friend. Today I’ll tell you: no one can touch what I’ve claimed.”

“Su Nantian, run. I’ll stop him; he can’t harm me.” Wu Lianxing said anxiously.

“Hmph, a coward hiding behind a woman—this is your friend? If the school knew, you’d become everyone’s laughingstock.” Yang Yan glared at Su Nantian, his eyes cold.

“That doesn’t concern you. I choose who to be friends with—be it my boyfriend.” Wu Lianxing pulled Su Nantian behind her, but he remained motionless.

Su Nantian took her hand and pulled her behind himself.

“They’re from the Wudao Society, very strong. You’re not their match—run.”

“Want to play hero?” Yang Yan stared at their hands, his eyes filled with hatred. “Zhang Kun, cut off that kid’s hand.”

“Yang Yan, you dare!” Wu Lianxing roared.

But it was too late—she only saw a blur, then Zhang Kun let out a thunderous scream.

She saw one hand tightly gripping his, hearing the sound of bones grinding and breaking—her skin prickled.

Staring at Su Nantian, she couldn’t believe his skill.

Zhang Kun was known in the Wudao Society—how could he be so easily subdued?

“Kneel and apologize.” Su Nantian’s cold voice echoed.

“No way,” Zhang Kun gritted his teeth.

The pain of broken bones was familiar, but this time it felt more intense than any before. His iron fists had been forged through countless breaks and regenerations, yet he couldn’t fathom why this pain was so severe.

“If this level of pain isn’t enough, how about a hundred times stronger?”

Zhang Kun didn’t believe it—how could pain be intensified a hundredfold?

He saw Su Nantian smile and extend his other hand, tapping Zhang Kun’s forehead. He released the tight grip on his hand.

“This is impossible—only you should kneel.”

He felt no strange sensation, but his painful expression twisted into a grimace. “I apologize.”

Zhang Kun gritted his teeth, struggling to rise from the ground. Blood and broken teeth scattered around him as he painfully uttered those three words.
