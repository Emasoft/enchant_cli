"Drag them out and chop them into pieces to feed the dogs!"

Wu Chuan narrowed his eyes, suddenly issuing this cruel command with a sinister expression.

After speaking, Wu Chuan added coldly: "Since they were so brave and dared to provoke me with their deaths, I will certainly not let them rest in peace!"

His furious gaze fell upon Wu Taotao and his wife, then he issued another order. This sentence was so cruel that those present shivered involuntarily upon hearing it.

Even Li, the assistant who had always been by Wu Chuan's side, shuddered involuntarily. His gaze toward Wu Chuan grew even more cautious. At the same time, Li silently told himself to be careful in the future and never offend Wu Chuan. Otherwise, his fate would likely be even more miserable than that of Wu Taotao and his wife.

"Hmph! These two despised people still naively believe that death would end everything and grant them eternal peace?"

At this moment, Wu Chuan let out a cold laugh. His expression was like a layer of frost, making people dare not meet his gaze directly.

After speaking these words, Wu Chuan continued with a cold smile: "Dreaming! They truly think that death would stop me from using them to threaten Wu You'er?"

At this point, Wu Chuan seemed to recall something. His lips curled slightly into a sinister and ruthless smile.

"I will make them regret forever for provoking me!"

Wu Chuan clenched his fists. His voice was low, like that of a demon rising from hell: "No one must spread the news of their suicide—especially not Wu You'er. Afterward, I will let Wu You'er share the anger they left behind."

He paused, then continued with a sinister tone: "This lifetime, Wu You'er will never escape!"

Wu Chuan smiled again with cruelty. Though he could not harm the dead, he would torment the living—no one could stop him!

Wu Chuan had already vowed to keep Wu You'er by his side for the rest of his life, tormenting her day and night so she would bear the anger Wu Taotao and his wife left behind.

Wu Taotao and his wife had cherished their daughter so much, hadn't they? Hadn't they hoped to escape by dying and using that as a way to resist Wu Chuan's threats against Wu You'er?

Then he would torment Wu You'er even more! He would never let her have peace for the rest of her life.

At this thought, Wu Chuan laughed even more freely. His face changed completely, and he looked like a coiled serpent ready to strike—just one glance at him made people shiver with cold.

"What are you still staring at? Didn't you hear my words?"

Wu Chuan was lost in his thoughts about how he would discipline Wu You'er later. His smile became even more pronounced, and he cast a disapproving glance at the two subordinates. Then he threatened: "What? Do you also want to be chopped into pieces and fed to the dogs?"

"No, no!"

Upon hearing Wu Chuan's words, the two subordinates suddenly snapped out of their shock and immediately got up to carry out Wu Chuan's orders.

However, they were still trembling uncontrollably while untying the ropes due to the shock of Wu Chuan's orders and his previous demeanor.

But they dared not say anything, quickly carrying Wu Taotao and his wife's bodies out of the room. They hurriedly left the secret chamber.

After they exited, they sighed in relief, thinking Wu Chuan's orders meant he was sparing them. They exchanged glances, their faces filled with relief at having survived.

Unfortunately, they did not see that after leaving, Li immediately stepped forward and whispered to Wu Chuan: "Sir, about those two people..."

Li looked at Wu Chuan with an inquisitive gaze. In truth, he already knew what Wu Chuan would order.

Indeed, the next moment, Wu Chuan curled his lips and let out a cold laugh before speaking coldly: "Kill them."

"Yes, sir!"

These two people had failed to perform their duties and had seen Wu Chuan's true face. Wu Chuan would definitely not leave them alive.

After receiving the order, Li immediately responded and prepared to deal with those two subordinates after leaving.

"Hmph! A chicken fighting a stone, overestimating one's abilities."

Wu Chuan cast a cold glance at the pillars that had bound Wu Taotao and his wife, then contemptuously spoke these words before turning away.

When Li saw Wu Chuan leave, he naturally dared not delay and immediately ran after him. He kept a step behind Wu Chuan, never daring to walk abreast with him or go ahead of him.

When their footsteps faded into the distance, Su Nantian, who had been hiding under a cabinet, quickly crawled out.

He recalled Wu Chuan's cruel and cold words, his eyes darkened, and his face grew solemn. His heart gave a sudden jolt.

Su Nantian had long known Wu Chuan was not as kind and harmless as he appeared, but he had never imagined that the core of Wu Chuan was a cold-blooded executioner with no feelings at all.

Chapter 721: Taking Wu You'er Away

No time to think about this now.

Wu Chuan had clearly stated that he would torment Wu You'er harshly in the future.

He must quickly take Wu You'er away—never let her become a toy for Wu Taotao's rage.

At this thought, Su Nantian's expression grew even more solemn. He quickly surveyed the surroundings and found no one around. Without hesitation, he leapt away to find Wu You'er again.

Su Nantian retraced his steps and quickly returned to the place where Wu You'er was held.

Thank heavens!

When Su Nantian saw the familiar faces guarding the door, he finally managed to relax slightly.

It seemed Wu Chuan was still dealing with Wu Taotao and his wife's situation, not immediately coming to unleash his rage on Wu You'er.

Thankfully, otherwise it would have been too late.

At this thought, Su Nantian decided not to hide any longer. He kicked a small stone at his feet toward the opposite direction.

"Crash—"

"What person!"

Upon hearing the noise, the security guards immediately became serious: "Who's there?"

After not receiving any response, they exchanged glances and said: "We'll split up. Two of us will check it out, while the other two stay here."

They divided into two groups. Half went to investigate, and the other half remained at the door.

Su Nantian was not at all nervous. He repeated his trick, kicking several stones in different directions, causing noises from various places.

"Quick! Check over there!"

Hearing so much noise, even the security guards at the door hurried to check around. They thought, after all, this door was locked with a password—no one could enter even if they stepped away for a moment.

But they did not know that Su Nantian had been waiting for this opportunity.

"The chance has come."

When Su Nantian saw they had all left, he brightened instantly and swiftly leapt over. Using his memory, he pressed the same password again. Within a second, he successfully entered.

After entering, Su Nantian did not forget to relock the password door and pushed several large flowerpots in front of the entrance to block it for a while.

"Someone has entered!"

When the password lock opened, it made some noise, immediately drawing the security guards' attention. They panicked and hurried back.

"Oops! Someone lured us away—we were tricked!"

Another security guard showed an angry expression and hurried back.

"Quickly, open the door!"

"Why can't it be opened?"

"It's definitely the correct password!"

The panicked voices of the security guards clearly reached Su Nantian's ears. Standing inside the password door, he let out a cold laugh.

He randomly pressed a few numbers inside and failed three times. The password door automatically locked, making it impossible for those outside to open it.

"Haha, take your time opening it."

Hearing their increasingly frantic voices, Su Nantian let out another cold laugh. Then he quickly turned around and prepared to go back and save Wu You'er.

"What's going on?"

Wu You'er heard the chaotic noise outside and the sound of knocking at the door. She immediately stepped out to check, just as she opened the door, she saw Su Nantian standing at the entrance.

"Su Nantian? You... why have you come back again?"

Wu You'er widened her eyes in surprise, looking at Su Nantian. Did the commotion outside have something to do with Su Nantian?

"Come in first."

Su Nantian directly pulled Wu You'er into the room. The password door and those large flowerpots would only block the security guards for a short time, at most delaying them slightly.

"What's going on? How did you provoke these people?"

Wu You'er heard the increasingly loud sound of knocking at the door and felt very uneasy. She had also felt a strange sensation earlier, as if her heart suddenly hurt and something had slipped away from her.

She pressed her hand against her chest, then anxiously asked Su Nantian.

Su Nantian had already entered but hadn't disturbed the security guards. Wu You'er believed that with Su Nantian's abilities, he could definitely avoid disturbing them.

So the only possibility now was that something had gone wrong.

"Now is not the time to talk about it. Come with me and leave Wu's house first. I'll explain everything after we get out."

Su Nantian pulled over furniture to block the door's position while calmly speaking to Wu You'er. If one listened carefully, they would notice Su Nantian's tone carried an unyielding determination.

"There are no windows here, and you've blocked the door. How are we supposed to escape?"

Wu You'er immediately told Su Nantian at this moment.

She had been imprisoned in this secret chamber by Wu Chuan as punishment for offending him. There was only a bed and a toilet here, nothing else.

Moreover, how could Wu Chuan be so kind as to leave her a window? He would definitely torment her harshly and take away all her light.

"Besides, I already told you, I won't leave until I'm sure my parents are safe."

Wu You'er said this and immediately added firmly: "Otherwise, I would have left with Su Nantian long ago. Why wait until now?"

"Come with me first. I need to ensure your safety."

When Su Nantian heard Wu You'er mention her parents, his eyes flickered and darkened for a moment. But he quickly spoke again:

"Come with me."

Su Nantian said this and then grabbed Wu You'er's wrist. This time, he had a slightly firm intention—intending to take her away regardless of her will.

"Su Nantian, I already told you, there's only one door here. We have no other way to escape."

Wu You'er said this, her brows slowly furrowing.

"No path?"

Su Nantian heard this and suddenly raised his eyebrows: "Is that so?"

He spoke, lightly and softly, with a glint in his eyes that Wu You'er could not understand.

As soon as Su Nantian's words ended, he immediately punched the wall in front of them, creating a hole.

"Crash!"

"You..."

Wu You'er's astonished voice and the sound of the wall breaking coincided. Her mouth slightly opened, her eyes filled with disbelief and shock.

"You... you..."

Wu You'er looked at Su Nantian, then at the wall with a large hole. She was momentarily speechless.

A single punch breaking through a wall—was this something a human could do?

Chapter 722: A Problem Arises

"Now there's a path."

Su Nantian collected Wu You'er's astonished gaze and smiled again, saying: "Let's go."

After speaking, Su Nantian stepped forward first. Seeing Wu You'er still standing in place without moving, he raised his eyebrows: "Aren't you coming?"

"I can't go with you."

Wu You'er clenched her fists, bit her lower lip, and shook her head.

"I'm sorry. I know you wasted so much time and effort to save me, but I can't leave without my parents."

Now that they had caused such a commotion, it would certainly draw Wu Chuan's attention.

If she left with Su Nantian now, Wu Chuan would definitely take her parents as revenge.

Wu You'er did not want to involve them, so she could not go with Su Nantian.

"I'm sorry, I can't go with you."

At this thought, Wu You'er's eyes became even more determined and she repeated the same sentence again.

"You..."

Su Nantian felt like his head was splitting in two, but thinking of Wu Taotao and his wife, he momentarily lost his words and did not know what to say.

"Come with me first. Leave this place, and I'll explain after we get out."

Su Nantian pressed his lips together, hesitated for a moment, and then extended his hand toward Wu You'er.

Seeing Wu You'er's pale face and weak, helpless appearance, Su Nantian truly could not say the terrible news.

So he could only hesitate and swallow his words back into his stomach.

"There's no time left. Come with me quickly! Otherwise, Wu's security guards will come after us!"

Su Nantian spoke again with urgency.

Wu's security guards and staff were not amateurs. They had only been briefly delayed by his small tricks, but they would likely break in soon.

If they did not leave now, it would become a big problem later.

"Why? Why are you so eager to make me leave? Did something happen?"

At this moment, Wu You'er suddenly thought of a possibility. She bit her lip again and frowned at Su Nantian, guessing why he was so urgent to urge her to leave.

"It must have gone wrong. Tell me!"

Wu You'er was not an idiot. On the contrary, she was very smart. Considering Su Nantian's reaction now, after a brief thought, she could guess that something was definitely wrong.

So without waiting for Su Nantian to answer, Wu You'er immediately continued questioning him, demanding an answer.

"Tell me first, and I'll go with you."

She could not leave like this without knowing.

But Wu You'er did not know why, but her heart started to feel a faint pain again. It felt like something she cared about was slipping away quietly.

This feeling was too unbearable.

Wu You'er's already pale face now looked like a piece of paper, and even her lips had turned white. She appeared very weak, as if a gust of wind would make her fall down.

"I..."

Su Nantian did not expect Wu You'er's sensitivity, and for a moment he was even more troubled.

These terrible news were really hard to tell Wu You'er.

He had learned about Wu You'er's background when he took on this mission and knew what this young girl had gone through in recent years. He felt very sympathetic for her misfortune.

Now, telling Wu You'er about even more tragic news was something Su Nantian truly could not bear.

But the more Su Nantian hesitated, the more Wu You'er's unease accumulated.

"What happened? Why won't you tell me!"

Wu You'er's tone became anxious, and her face showed a sense of urgency.

"Crash—"

As Wu You'er continued to question Su Nantian, the door of this small room was also being forcefully knocked. It looked like one of the security guards outside.

This thought had just formed, and the security guards and bodyguards outside began to shout loudly: "You people inside! You can't escape! Be sensible and open the door! Hurry up!"

"Wu You'er, come with me!"

At this critical moment, Su Nantian's face also showed some urgency. He unhesitatingly grabbed Wu You'er's wrist, preparing to forcibly take her away.

But at this moment, Wu You'er struggled to free herself and angrily questioned: "Tell me! What happened? Tell me..."

But by the end of her sentence, Wu You'er's voice seemed to weaken, and she noticed that a hot tear had slipped down her left eye.

"What happened... why do I feel sad..."

Wu You'er slowly wiped away the tear, but at this moment, both of her eyes started to cry, and they were like pearls falling from a broken thread, one after another...

"Wu You'er..."

"Crash!"

As Su Nantian was about to comfort Wu You'er's emotions, the door could no longer withstand the force and was kicked open from outside. It fell heavily to the ground with a loud sound, scattering dust everywhere.

"It's you!"

One of the security guards immediately recognized Su Nantian: "The person who brought food earlier!"

Another security guard also spoke immediately: "I had a feeling you were suspicious from the start. You definitely have something wrong!"

"Damn."

Su Nantian saw these people had entered, his face changed immediately. He cursed under his breath and quickly looked at Wu You'er: "Come with me."

It was too late to delay.

Now that there were only a few security guards, Su Nantian could try to control the situation and avoid causing too much disturbance. But if these people contacted above, it would be a problem.

"No."

But Wu You'er still stubbornly refused at this moment. She bit her lower lip and insisted on her previous idea, refusing to go with Su Nantian.

Moreover, Wu You'er was very determined, and her expression was extremely resolute.

"You..."

Su Nantian was truly at a loss, not knowing what to do with Wu You'er.

"Quick! Catch him! Don't let him escape!"

At this moment, the security guards shouted and ordered to catch Su Nantian.

"You go first! Don't let them catch you!"

Wu You'er, upon hearing this, rushed to Su Nantian's front and urged him: "You go first!"

"You... well, then."

Su Nantian carefully observed Wu You'er and knew she would not change her mind. He could only sigh helplessly: "I'll come back."

He said this and hurriedly left.

Chapter 723: Coercion and Torture

"Quick! Stop him, don't let him escape!"

The other security guards had not expected Su Nantian to leave immediately without a word, and he ignored them entirely from the start.

After realizing this, they hurriedly spoke to stop Su Nantian.

At this moment, Wu You'er spread her arms and directly blocked the hole in front of everyone, not allowing anyone to pass: "Stop! No one is allowed to chase after him!"

This brief delay allowed Su Nantian to successfully escape.

"Miss Wu You'er!"

The head of the security guards frowned and looked at Wu You'er with dissatisfaction, but due to Wu You'er's status, he dared not be truly angry. He only showed a slight dissatisfaction.

"Are you doing this to protect that man?"

The head of the security guards asked with dissatisfaction and said: "If the master learns about this, he definitely won't ignore it."

It was for this reason that the head of the security guards felt so annoyed, thinking Wu You'er had always been hindering him.

"You don't say it, how would Wu Chuan know?"

Wu You'er took a deep breath and stared back at the head of the security guards: "There are only you people here. If you don't say it, he won't know either."

The implication was to tell these people not to speak out.

"But Miss Wu You'er..."

The head of the security guards had not expected Wu You'er to say this, and for a moment he was stunned, unable to find words to counter Wu You'er.

"There's no 'but'."

He had not finished speaking when Wu You'er directly interrupted him: "In short, all of you listen carefully. No one is allowed to tell Wu Chuan about what happened tonight!"

Su Nantian was trying to save her, and Wu You'er definitely did not want to see Su Nantian risk his life for her.

"Ah..."

The security guards also looked at each other in confusion, unsure of Wu You'er's intentions but unable to find words to argue.

"In short, no one is allowed to say it!"

Wu You'er swallowed her saliva and continued giving orders, hoping that her position as the head of the family would add some authority to make these people fear a little.

"Haha, what's not allowed to be said?"

Unexpectedly, Wu Chuan himself appeared at this moment.

His expression was gloomy, and his gaze toward Wu You'er was like a venomous snake—extremely dangerous.

Wu Chuan slowly stepped in, and immediately saw the large hole behind Wu You'er. His eyes changed instantly.

"You..."

Wu You'er was so frightened she took a step back, and as a result, tripped over the edge of the wall hole and fell to the ground awkwardly. She also lost all the composure she had just made.

"What happened?"

Wu Chuan only cast a cold glance at Wu You'er and showed no intention of caring about her. He turned his gaze from the broken hole back to the head of the security guards.

"What is it that you cannot tell me?"

Wu Chuan smiled again coldly, and although this was a simple sentence, it carried infinite pressure. It felt like a mountain pressing on the head of the security guard, making him dare not even breathe.

"Subordinates are afraid! This is all Miss Wu You'er's threat, but we have not agreed to it!"

In the Wu family, Wu Chuan was the sky—absolute power.

So how could the head of the security guards defy Wu Chuan?

He wisely explained and shifted all blame to Wu You'er, making himself seem like an innocent victim caught in her scheme.

"Master, it's really like that! We didn't agree to anything with Miss Wu You'er. We definitely won't collude with her!"

The other security guards, seeing even the head of the security guard had said this, also explained to Wu Chuan their loyalty.

"Oh? Is that so?"

Wu Chuan smiled at this and cast a mocking glance at Wu You'er, who was still lying on the ground. Then he turned his gaze back to the head of the security guards and asked: "Tell me, what exactly happened?"

The head of the security guards dared not lie to Wu Chuan. So he immediately explained everything that had happened.

"Master, this is how it was. The strange man played the role of a food deliverer and tried to take Miss Wu You'er away. Fortunately, we discovered it in time and prevented this."

The head of the security guards immediately explained and quickly added: "But that man was too clever. Miss Wu You'er also blocked us, so we let him escape by chance."

"Hmph."

After hearing this, Wu Chuan understood the whole situation. He let out a cold laugh and said: "Good, very good. I underestimated your family of three. You each brought me surprises."

"What happened to my parents? What did you do to them?"

When Wu You'er heard Wu Chuan's words, she had a bad feeling and immediately questioned him. She looked at him angrily, as if she wanted to kill him with her eyes.

"They?"

Wu Chuan raised his eyebrows and sneered, then said cruelly: "They are naturally fine. But whether you are fine, I'm not sure."

Wu Chuan had never expected Wu You'er to know another outsider. This man was even bold enough to break into the Wu family at night to save her.

Not to mention anything else, just this boldness was enough for Wu Chuan to be interested in him.

"Wu You'er, I'll give you a chance. Tell me who this person is, and I will spare you."

Wu Chuan thought of this and narrowed his eyes, threatening Wu You'er: "Otherwise..."

After saying 'otherwise', Wu Chuan stopped. He intentionally left the sentence unfinished to create suspense and let Wu You'er imagine it herself, scaring her.

At this point, Wu Chuan took a few steps forward and approached Wu You'er: "You'd better be sensible. Don't force me to take action."

"Then just take action directly!"

Wu You'er did not fear Wu Chuan's threat at all. She met his gaze directly and said firmly: "I won't tell you anything. I don't know who that person is."

At this moment, Wu You'er's hands were tightly clenched.

To betray Su Nantian would be better than killing her!

"you don't say?"

Wu Chuan seemed to have expected Wu You'er's reaction and was not very angry. He only deepened his tone slightly.

"I advise you, while I still have a little patience for you, tell me immediately."

Wu Chuan paused for a moment and continued: "Unless, you really want to watch your parents suffer for the sake of an outsider."

Although Wu Taotao and his wife had already committed suicide, this did not prevent Wu Chuan from using them to threaten Wu You'er.

Chapter 724: The Cruel Truth

"You!"

Wu You'er had never known Wu Chuan's face was so thick, using her parents to threaten her so easily.

But Wu You'er also knew that no matter how many times Wu Chuan threatened her, she would be affected.

Who could help it? She truly cared about her parents!

"Are you saying or not?"

Wu Chuan let out a cold laugh and cruelly looked at Wu You'er, waiting for her to play the game.

"You should think carefully."

Wu Chuan pressed forward, slowly approaching Wu You'er and continuing to pressure her for an answer.

"I don't know anything, no matter how many times you ask me, I still don't know!"

Wu You'er said this firmly and immediately closed her eyes without looking at Wu Chuan.

"You?"

Wu Chuan frowned, clearly not expecting that even after he had brought up her parents, she still did not care. It seemed like she could not be threatened at all.

This method that had worked before now met a bottleneck, and Wu Chuan's expression immediately became more gloomy. He glared at Wu You'er fiercely, and his face darkened.

He had thought Wu You'er would be scared like before, but she had actually hardened her heart this time. He truly underestimated her!

The more he thought about it, the more interested Wu Chuan became in the man who had disappeared.

He must find out who this person was!

Wu Chuan paused for a moment, looking down at Wu You'er from above and said to her: "Have you really thought it through? Are you truly not going to care about your parents?"

At this point, Wu Chuan's tone gradually lowered and became more gloomy. Each word was like a knife stabbing at Wu You'er's heart: "Haha, you are really a filial daughter. For the sake of a stranger, you would even abandon your parents?"

"I..."

Wu You'er's face became even paler, and her lips had gradually lost their color.

She wanted to shout back at Wu Chuan, saying she never had this intention and that her parents were always the top priority in her heart. Otherwise, with so many chances to escape before, she would have already left.

Why stay in this cage and endure Wu Chuan's cruelty?

Thinking about these accusations, Wu You'er slowly clenched her hands into fists. Her nails had pressed painfully into her palm, but Wu You'er still did not back down.

Wu You'er would not allow herself to show any weakness.

She knew she was still in Wu Chuan's hands, and Wu Chuan needed to use her parents to control her. So he would only give them a little punishment or threat.

But if she exposed Su Nantian, it would mean dragging the innocent Su Nantian into this pit as well!

This pain was something she should bear, and Wu You'er would not allow herself to involve others.

At this thought, Wu You'er swallowed her saliva again and looked up more firmly: "I don't know what you're talking about."

At this point, Wu You'er had made up her mind and would not involve Su Nantian.

"Good, very good. I like your backbone!"

Wu Chuan was so angry at Wu You'er's firmness that his face turned red. Wu Taotao and his wife had already tricked him, but now even the timid Wu You'er dared to oppose him and defy his orders.

Thinking about this, Wu Chuan's face became even more gloomy, almost like ink dripping.

"You'd better keep this determination!"

The anger from Wu Taotao and his wife had accumulated, and now seeing Wu You'er also opposing him and defying him, Wu Chuan decided to take this new grudge and old resentment together.

Moreover, Wu Chuan's eyes now looked like they were about to ignite with fire.

If he had met this gaze before, Wu You'er might have been scared, but today she still clenched her fists tightly and gritted her teeth, not allowing herself to show any fear.

Then she looked up with a straight back at Wu Chuan, her eyes full of unshakable determination.

She would never submit to Wu Chuan and would definitely not involve Su Nantian!

"Look, you think I'm afraid of you? You think you're still the same status? Do you think Wu Family can't function without you?"

Wu Chuan let out a cold laugh and cruelly spoke this truth, completely shattering Wu You'er's illusion and dream.

"Before it was just to keep the peace, so I put you in the position of head of the family. It hasn't been long since you became head, and you haven't learned anything yet. But you've already developed the habits of a head of family, and now you dare to challenge me?"

Wu Chuan's anger grew more intense with each word, and his voice became even more venomous.

After saying this, he did not care that Wu You'er's face had turned even paler from his words. He continued: "This time I've already decided, after this wetland bidding competition, I will officially announce to the outside world that I, Wu Chuan, am the true head of the Wu family."

He paused and cast a cold gaze at Wu You'er before continuing: "And you are just an abandoned piece, nothing more. Do you dare to be arrogant in front of me?"

When Wu Chuan said Wu You'er's name, it was almost with clenched teeth. Each word came out from between his teeth, making people feel uneasy.

Wu You'er also felt a bit of fear and tension from Wu Chuan's voice.

Moreover, she was wrapped in an uneasy emotion. There was also something that confused Wu You'er: she felt her heart was empty, as if she had lost something precious. Or perhaps something valuable was beginning to slip away from her fingers, and she could not catch it.

"I don't care about being head of the family. It was you who forced me!"

Wu You'er clenched her fists tightly and then defiantly replied to Wu Chuan.

Did she think she was just a pawn for him?

She had no freedom at all and was constantly threatened by him. If it weren't for Wu Chuan's threat to her parents, she would have already left the Wu family.

At this thought, Wu You'er's resolve became even stronger.

"Wu Chuan, since you are going to become the head of the family in the future, I am no longer useful to you."

Wu You'er had now made up her mind. She looked at Wu Chuan and spoke seriously: "I hope you will release me and my parents. From now on, we can keep to ourselves. You should not bother our peaceful life!"

Wu You'er said this and gave Wu Chuan a determined look: "You shouldn't try to keep me imprisoned anymore!"

Chapter 725: Continuing to Manipulate

"Hahaha!"

Unexpectedly, when Wu You'er heard this sentence from Wu Chuan, it seemed like he had heard a joke. He immediately let out a loud laugh.

Wu You'er felt more and more nervous because of Wu Chuan's laughter, as if a heavy stone had been placed on her chest. It was thick and heavy, making it almost impossible for her to breathe.

"Did you say I should release you?"

Wu Chuan seemed to have heard something absurd and sneered, looking at Wu You'er with complete contempt.

"Yes! Release us!"

Wu You'er clenched her fists tightly, even though she did not know why Wu Chuan was laughing like this. She still continued to look at Wu Chuan firmly.

"Dreaming!"
