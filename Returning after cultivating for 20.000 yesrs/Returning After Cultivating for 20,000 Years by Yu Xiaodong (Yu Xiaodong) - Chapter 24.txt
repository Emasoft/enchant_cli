Three girls chattered in the room about their shopping today. Even Yao Lina, despite her modest family background, could be considered a minor affluent household. Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing were even wealthier. Yet, despite this, the three girls had no habit of extravagant spending.

They had spent the day shopping and bought numerous items, mostly clothes. These garments and accessories were all for Su Nantian. For instance, they had bought three sets of the same brand's sportswear. To Su Nantian, these looked identical, but to the three girls, each set had its own unique charm. Naturally, each chose one as a gift for Su Nantian.

The three girls chattered endlessly. For some reason, their conversation shifted from clothes to Su Nantian's impressive physique—his six-pack abs... and that...

Lin Suyun and Yao Lina were the closest of friends, confidantes who shared everything. They spoke without hesitation or restraint. Gao Jingjing, however, was a naive girl who had never participated in such topics. Listening to her two elder sisters discussing it with giggles, she blushed furiously.

Yet for some reason, she did not leave but stood there, trying to minimize her presence while also staring wide-eyed and listening intently.

After chatting for a while, they suddenly felt something was amiss. “Hey, where's Nantian?” Lin Suyun asked.

Lin Suyun entered Su Nantian’s room and found him sprawled on the bed. “Hey, Nantian, why did you collapse? We bought so much food; you need to cook for us!” she said, grabbing his arm. Unexpectedly, Su Nantian used his strength to pull her onto the bed.

“Good wife, don’t tease. I’m exhausted; let me rest a bit! As for dinner, leave it to you all! I definitely won’t cook today—never!” he said, hugging Lin Suyun and gently kissing her lips.

“You can’t say that! You know, whether it’s me, Jingjing, or Yao Lina, none of us are good at cooking. So dinner still has to be your job! Just cook it properly today, and there’ll be a reward in the evening!”

“Huh? A reward?”

Su Nantian blinked, asking cautiously, “What’s the reward? And do you think I’m someone who craves rewards? Cooking is out of the question!”

“Tonight, Yao Lina will stay at our house. That’s your reward, right?”

“She… she staying doesn’t concern me! I…” For the first time, his usual thick skin showed a faint blush.

“Then… I’ll go cook! Mainly because I’m hungry, and you two might not even be able to eat it!”

Chapter 108: Kidnapping

Seeing Su Nantian’s hasty exit, Lin Suyun smiled faintly. Her smile gradually faded into a melancholic and bitter expression.

Which woman doesn’t desire her husband’s complete love? Who willingly shares their husband with others?

Lin Suyun didn’t know if such women existed in the world, but she wasn’t one. She knew she was selfish, wanting Nantian all to herself.

Yet she couldn’t help it. As a woman, she understood that no one could resist Nantian’s charm—his handsome and radiant appearance, his cheerful nature, talent, and tenderness. It was like a poison that lured women to their doom.

Once ensnared, there was no escape.

Lin Suyun sighed in the room while Su Nantian cooked. Though it wasn’t their first time eating his meals, when he laid out a table full of delicious dishes with vibrant colors and enticing aromas, the three beauties couldn’t help but be amazed.

In this world, only food should never be betrayed. Though Yao Lina and Lin Suyun wanted to eat less to avoid gaining weight, they ended up overeating.

After dinner, the three girls lay on the sofa, too tired to move. Su Nantian alone took on the burden of cleaning up.

After finishing, they chatted about daily matters. Finally, it was nighttime—the most exciting part of separating into rooms.

Su Nantian knew the guest rooms were more than enough, so they could each have their own room. However, thinking of Lin Suyun’s promise of a reward, his heart fluttered.

Seeing the three girls sitting on the sofa, Su Nantian felt a sudden urge.

After arranging their rooms, he returned to his own and waited for the promised reward. But as he waited, he fell asleep.

When he opened his eyes again, it was past midnight. Still longing for the reward, Su Nantian realized it hadn’t arrived yet and decided to take initiative.

Under the faint moonlight, he approached Lin Suyun’s room. He gently pressed down on the door handle and it opened.

Su Nantian felt a slight stir. It seemed this little girl had left the door open for him.

He took off his clothes and rushed onto the bed...

“Hmm, it’s gotten bigger again,” Su Nantian mused. But something felt off.

He opened his eyes and saw two pairs of eyes staring at him.

“Uh…”

Awkward. Mainly because his hand hadn’t retracted yet—apparently it was Yao Lina’s. No wonder it felt bigger.

After all, they weren’t strangers… just go with it!

Su Nantian couldn’t figure out how to handle the awkwardness, so he gave up. Since it was a reward, he’d just accept it as such.

“Ah… Nantian Brother… no…”

It was too late to refuse now, wasn’t it?

That night was stormy. When they woke up the next morning, Lin Suyun and Yao Lina were both flushed with embarrassment. Only Su Nantian smiled contentedly.

The breakfast atmosphere was strange, leaving Gao Jingjing puzzled. She felt something odd had happened between her sisters without her knowing.

Though she pressed them repeatedly, no one answered. She could only keep the questions in her heart.

After breakfast, there was nothing to do, so Yao Lina decided to go home.

As she stepped out of the Fengyue residential area, she was spotted by Wu Jia’s group who had waited all night.

“Fourth and sixth elder, this is the girl! Since those two didn’t have a chance, we’ll take care of her first!”

Wu Changshan ordered the fourth and sixth elders. They immediately attacked.

Yao Lina’s combat ability could easily subdue two street punks, let alone the disciples of a cultivation family.

Su Nantian had fought all night and was utterly exhausted. Though the two girls were flushed with embarrassment, their performance last night had been incredibly passionate.

Even with Su Nantian’s unbreakable body, he had nearly been drained to death.

Yao Lina returned to school; Lin Suyun took Gao Jingjing to inspect the company. The entire Lin Group was now under Lin Suyun’s control, though many matters were still under Su Nantian’s name. He simply wasn’t a diligent company manager.

Lying in bed, he rested from the previous day’s fatigue. He had just fallen asleep when a sharp phone call woke him.

“Who is it? Can’t you let me sleep in the morning? Talk later!”

Su Nantian grumbled into the receiver, still groggy.

Meanwhile, Wu Liuliu in the abandoned building was stunned.

Though this was his first time kidnapping, he hadn’t read much—why did the kidnapper have to be the one in charge?

Why? You dare hang up on me? Give Wu Liuliu some respect! I don’t care about my dignity!

The fourth and sixth elders held the phone, unsure. They stared at each other in confusion.

“Maybe… we should wait and call again?”

Su Nantian’s morning grumpiness had been harsh, scaring Wu Liuliu a little.

At that moment, Wu Changshan was in a small dark room with Yao Lina. However, he was at a loss. It wasn’t that he held back; it was because Yao Lina had summoned a protective barrier around herself, leaving Wu Changshan confused.

He saw clearly the barrier came from her white jade bracelet. Though its defense wasn’t particularly strong, it could withstand his full attack.

Wu Changshan eyed it longingly. Though it wasn’t strong, it was still a defensive artifact.

After all, the entire Wu family had only two or three artifacts in total, kept in their ancestral hall. They weren’t allowed to use them.

Now he wanted a way to take the jade bracelet without causing damage.

As he thought, he heard the two fools still planning to call at noon. It made him furious.

“Call! Now! Tell him to come immediately, or we’ll kill her!”

Chapter 109: Again in the Western Suburbs

Su Nantian was lying in bed when he suddenly sat up, his face icy with fury.

He had felt his spiritual artifact activate!

Besides the miscellaneous ones, he had crafted three true artifacts. He had given each to his three women. Each contained a fragment of his spiritual awareness, hidden until activated.

After getting up, Su Nantian told himself to stay calm. But his killing intent refused to subside.

From the activation level, it seemed safe now, but that might change.

“Yao Lina!” Su Nantian confirmed the attack’s target by sensing his spiritual awareness within the jade bracelet.

He approached the altar. Before he could speak, Su Yu Jian had already emerged from it and attached to his body.

Though they often bickered, they were mentally connected.

Then the Rolls-Royce Phantom roared under Su Nantian’s control, unleashing its true speed for the first time.

Su Nantian wasn’t a skilled driver, but his reflexes and hand speed were exceptional. The top-tier sports car shot toward the Western Suburbs like an arrow.

He even doubted if the Western Suburbs had some connection with him. Why did everything always happen there?

Was there no other suburban area in Fengcheng?

...

Ren Zhengyang was a rich second-generation. Though this was how others described him, he often took pride in it. He believed his family’s wealth was meant for spending. Those who criticized him as a rich second-gen were likely jealous.

Though he wasn’t particularly bad, he was one of the better ones among the so-called rich second-gens. It was complicated to describe, but simple in reality—no major mistakes, just minor ones.

He had a habit of flirting with married women online, around thirty years old. This habit was quite bad but not a major issue. As the saying goes, flies don’t attack seamless eggs. Women who fell for him knew they were just looking for a one-night stand.

Fengcheng was a small city. If it weren’t for the girl from yesterday, he might never have come here.

Early in the morning, he drove his Ferrari out of the residential area. As soon as he hit the main road, a black arrow shot past him.

“Damn! Rolls-Royce Phantom!”

Ren Zhengyang was discerning. Just by glimpsing it, he could tell what car it was. His energy instantly returned, as if the previous night’s exhaustion had been replenished.

It was just that car’s speed and style were so impressive.

Besides women, he loved cars. Unfortunately, he had never been satisfied with his car.

As a member of the top family in Beijing, he had money and power. But he wasn’t the only son; there was an older brother. Though a top-tier rich second-gen, his monthly allowance wasn’t limitless.

“Can’t let this person be so cool. I must chase after him!”

Seeing the Rolls-Royce Phantom disappear around a corner, Ren Zhengyang immediately accelerated. Hmph! Trying to show off in front of me? You’re still too young!

His red Ferrari reached maximum speed. In the bustling city, it rushed forward.

Fortunately, Su Nantian had already cleared a path for him. This Ren Zhengyang, though he spent his days racing, drinking, and chasing women, had put in some effort with cars. He could barely keep up.

Su Nantian noticed a car following him but didn’t care. At this moment, nothing could distract him—his only thought was that Yao Lina must be safe and waiting for his rescue.

“Ring ring!”

A sharp phone call rang. Su Nantian answered, recognizing the number as unfamiliar but vaguely familiar.

After a quick glance, he realized it was the insurance salesman who had called in the morning.

Normally, Su Nantian would chat with the caller. But now he had no time; he hung up, his face full of worry.

In the Western Suburbs’ abandoned building, Wu Changshan and his men stared at each other in confusion.

“What’s wrong now?”

Wu Changshan saw their expressions and felt a wave of nausea. Though the fourth and sixth elders had higher cultivation, he’d never heard of any spiritual arts having a side effect of lowering intelligence.

At this moment, Wu Changshan felt like running away. He’d heard rumors that opposing the protagonist would instantly lower one’s intelligence.

“Big brother, these commoners are really hard to deal with. Kidnapping is so difficult.”

“They didn’t answer the call; maybe he’s still asleep. Let’s wait a bit more?”

“Call! Keep calling until we get through!”

He glared at them, then turned away. Seeing these two were unreliable, he needed to make more preparations.

Though Wu Changshan looked a bit foolish and his strength was weak, he was the only one in the Wu family who specialized in formations. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been made a Grand Elder.

Unfortunately, the Wu family’s formation inheritance was severely incomplete. Wu Changshan had spent years patching it up but achieved little. He could only add some trap and assassination techniques to the formations, giving them a bit of power.

Meanwhile, he was searching for a spot to hide his thunder seeds. On the other hand, Su Nantian had already arrived near this abandoned building in his Rolls-Royce Phantom.

Getting out of the car, Su Nantian casually walked toward the central building. His spiritual awareness had sensed Yao Lina’s presence, and she was safe for now.

Chapter 110: Ren Zhengyang

As soon as he approached the area, Su Nantian felt Yao Lina’s presence. Fortunately, she was safe and protected by a barrier.

Besides Yao Lina, he sensed seven or eight spiritual energy fluctuations—cultivators. This surprised him.

Honestly, this was the first time since returning to Earth that Su Nantian had encountered so many cultivators at once.

Previously, the decline of the Gao family and Wu Changshan’s low cultivation level had made Su Nantian feel that cultivation on Earth was fading, with no major forces.

But now encountering so many at once was quite shocking.

He didn’t know what these cultivators wanted with Yao Lina, a regular girl. But regardless, he would kill them.

In Su Nantian’s perception, besides Yao Lina, there were three stronger ones—about the same level as his cultivation.

Outside the building, five weaker ones were spread around, with the strongest at the fifth level of cultivation and the weakest at the first.

To rescue Yao Lina, he couldn’t alert them. Su Nantian’s body shimmered, and Su Yu Jian stepped out.

Without a word, they exchanged glances and nodded. One went left, the other right, surrounding the small fry hiding between the buildings.

Though they were numerous, being in the open gave them no advantage.

Once these small pests were eliminated, he and Su Yu Jian could easily defeat the three inside. After all, Yao Lina’s barrier was his creation and wouldn’t break easily.

They moved silently between the buildings, appearing behind each group of shadows. In an instant, they slit throats or snapped necks, killing them without a sound.

At this moment, Su Nantian and Su Yu Jian were more like shadow units than the five Wu family elite killers.

Ren Zhengyang drove his Ferrari, barely keeping up with the Rolls-Royce Phantom. Unknowingly, he had also arrived at the Western Suburbs’ abandoned building.

When he got there, he felt a bit nervous. Though his family’s assets weren’t as much as those in Beijing, he was the favorite grandson of Ren Lao. He had experienced countless kidnappings and threats as a child.

Luckily, his family’s bodyguards in Beijing were effective, allowing him to grow up without incident.

With years of kidnapping experience, he now doubted if someone had targeted him to set a trap and lure him here.

After all, he had ditched his bodyguards to come here secretly for that woman.

As he imagined the plot, he watched the Phantom. Then he saw a handsome young man step out of it. He seemed vaguely familiar.

“Wow! Shadow Clone?”

Then he saw another identical figure emerge from the young man’s body.

The new one wore a green robe and held a jade sword, looking even more flashy than him. Ren Zhengyang felt a bit envious.

If he had such a body, his mission to save countless women would be more successful!

He got out of the Ferrari and crept toward them. He saw these two split up, jumping between buildings and instantly appearing behind each “ninja,” killing them effortlessly.

Ren Zhengyang felt a bit scared but also excited.

As a rich second-gen, his failure stemmed from having no goals. The Ren family in Beijing had everything—money and power. These were goals that ordinary people spent their lives striving for, but Ren Zhengyang had them from birth.

Though there was an older brother who would inherit the family fortune, his annual dividends were enough for him to live extravagantly.

So he didn’t know what to do or what goals he had. Besides racing and chasing women, there was nothing else.

But today, seeing Su Nantian’s “Shadow Clone,” he suddenly realized there was another world beneath the ordinary one—more appealing and exciting.

I want to be a Hokage!

At this moment, Ren Zhengyang secretly set his goal and decided to strive for it.

Feeling the rush of energy in his body, he clenched his fists and smiled confidently.

This was youth? This was the power of热血 (passion)? He had never felt so energetic and determined before.

Maybe this passion could only be felt when successfully seducing a woman!

Su Nantian didn’t know he had followed by another “middle schooler” (a term for a person with an overactive imagination). After eliminating the so-called killers, Su Yu Jian re-entered his body. He walked alone toward the largest abandoned building.

Inside this building, Wu Changshan and his men were still calling. But Su Nantian had left the phone in the car, so no one answered.

Wu Changshan crouched before Yao Lina, studying the golden barrier with fascination.

Yao Lina hid in a corner, watching this lecherous old man. She didn’t know what to say. She hadn’t expected the jade bracelet Su Nantian gave her to be so powerful.

Besides initial fear, she now felt confident. While Wu Changshan studied the barrier, she also observed this lecherous old man.

Actually, Yao Lina’s bracelet was the strongest among the three artifacts.

Su Nantian had divided jade pieces based on their texture and pattern, obtaining three jade blanks. This one used as a bracelet was the largest, capable of withstanding more complex formations.

“Boom!”

A loud noise outside made Wu Changshan and Yao Lina both freeze.

Yao Lina was scared, not knowing what happened. Wu Changshan smiled, waiting for him to arrive.

Chapter 111: Killing Formation

From the inner room, he saw the two fools still calling.

Wu Changshan angrily said, “No need to call. He’s already here!”

Before he finished speaking, Su Nantian had entered through the door!

Wu Changshan saw it was just him, no weapon in hand. He walked boldly through the front door and mocked, “Brave! I haven’t found you yet, but you’ve come to me!”

If the sword-wielding youth wasn’t here, Wu Changshan would have no fear.

He didn’t believe everyone could restrain their abilities so well.

Su Nantian saw him looking behind, shook his head, and Su Yu Jian stepped out of his body. He asked Wu Changshan, “Are you looking for me?”

“This… Shadow Clone?”

Seeing Su Nantian appear before them, the fourth and sixth elders were startled. They gasped in surprise.

“Stop fooling around! Kill them!”

But Wu Changshan didn’t care. Though the sword-wielding youth was self-restrained, there were still the fourth and sixth elders.

Hearing Wu Changshan’s words, the fourth and sixth elders exchanged a glance and rushed toward Su Yu Jian.

In their minds, Shadow Clones were weaker than the original. Su Nantian’s methods were indeed strange, making them afraid.

Wu Changshan saw his brothers rushing toward Su Yu Jian and was secretly pleased. These two didn’t know the sword-wielding youth’s strength, but he did. It was better not to provoke them.

As for Su Nantian, he had confidence in defeating him. Though his cultivation was one level lower than Su Nantian’s, he specialized in formations.

Seeing Wu Changshan rushing toward him, Su Nantian smiled slightly. His eyes were cold.

This time, he truly had a killing intent.

Previously, when fighting with those so-called aristocratic sons over flirtations and showing off, Su Nantian had mostly played.

After cultivating for 20,000 years in the spiritual world, his heart had long been calm. He found these new activities amusing.

But only under the premise of not harming his loved ones! Wu Changshan’s actions had truly touched Su Nantian’s nerve.

He was scared. If it weren’t for the fact that he had recently crafted protective jade items for all three women, this incident might have led to irreversible consequences.

At that time, even if he killed them all, it wouldn’t help. 20,000 years of cultivation had not taught him how to make a “regret pill.”

A sly smile appeared on his face. At this moment, he had decided to kill them all here.

But he hadn’t expected that just as they were about to clash, the ground beneath him suddenly exploded!

Not just explosives but thunder seeds imbued with spiritual energy.

Even Su Nantian’s iron-like body couldn’t withstand it. Though he had no visible injuries, his internal organs were shaken, and a streak of blood flowed from his mouth.

Su Nantian was stunned. He hadn’t expected to be injured on Earth.

In fact, though his cultivation had faded, 20,000 years of spiritual practice gave him a haughty attitude. He had no respect for these Earth cultivators, lacking any urgency and living carefree.

But today, he finally realized that he wasn’t invincible. He could be injured, bleed, and feel pain.

Su Nantian’s vision blurred, as if returning to his early days in the spiritual world—battling with peers.

He wiped the blood from his mouth and felt his heart, long dormant, now burning fiercely.

“Haha.”

He let out a series of laughs with an odd expression. Wu Changshan felt afraid, as if facing this kid was a变态 (pervert).

No longer hesitating, he formed a formation. Suddenly, light flowed around Su Nantian, and a massive formation arose!

But why did the formation’s style seem off?

Chinese formations had rules. There were long snake formations, yin-yang two-compass formations, three-principles formations, four-image formations, five-element eight-trigrams formations—each with its own rules.

But Wu Changshan’s formation was different! It was circular, with two interlocking rings and a glowing six-pointed star embedded in them.

Su Nantian suddenly remembered an anime he had watched as a child. This magic formation was similar to that of the magical girl Sakura!

But it wasn’t the time to think about this. Just as he was about to act, the formation’s nodes all had thunder seeds floating above them. In an instant, they exploded!

“Damn it!”

Wu Changshan wasn’t strong, but he was ruthless.

Dozens of thunder seeds exploded with the formation’s amplification. Su Nantian believed that with his current cultivation, he would be reduced to ashes.

No time to think. He jumped off the ground, and a black shadow appeared beneath him—Death Raven.

It carried Su Nantian upward. Though the six-pointed star formation wasn’t solid, its layers were enough to block Su Nantian for a few seconds.

The thunder seeds’ explosion would kill him in those seconds, reducing him to ashes.

It must be said that Wu Changshan, though his cultivation was low and strength weak, was a genius in some aspects.

Su Nantian could never have thought of such a tactic!

The explosion’s power, amplified by the formation, created a towering fire column like a volcanic eruption. It quickly caught up with Death Raven and Su Nantian, engulfing them completely.

On the ground, Wu Changshan laughed maniacally. “You guys are so bold! You called yourselves geniuses! You all looked down on me Wu Changshan!

How about now? You’re still dying at my hands!”

The explosion’s shockwave forced the battlefield between Wu Changshan, the fourth and sixth elders, and Su Yu Jian to separate. Even Ren Zhengyang, far away, stared in shock at the fire column.

And the old man shouting triumphantly beneath it!

Chapter 112: Conclusion

“You bastard, so bold!”

Suddenly, a gritted voice interrupted Wu Changshan’s laughter.

Su Nantian stepped out of the flames, his iron-like body glowing red-hot and emitting a sizzling sound.

His clothes were reduced to tatters, clinging to his shoulders. A black bird perched there—now unrecognizable.

Though it had been black before, now the feathers were charred. It looked like a roasted chicken.

Seeing Su Nantian step out of the flames, Wu Changshan couldn’t believe it.

“How… how?!”

He knew the fire’s power well. The thunder seeds’ explosion had created such high temperatures that even the newest alloys could melt into water. He hadn’t met any living creature that could survive this heat!

“Haha, how? Don’t believe it?”

Su Nantian flashed forward, creating a whirlwind of fire. He appeared before Wu Changshan.

His hand still burning with fire clamped around Wu Changshan’s neck, making his breathing difficult.

At this moment, Wu Changshan still stared at Su Nantian in disbelief, his eyes wide.

“Who… who are you…?”

He refused to believe that the thunder seeds couldn’t harm this person.

“Haha, I? I’m your grandfather!”

Su Nantian smiled, his expression now kind, as if truly being Wu Changshan’s grandfather.

But his hand kept applying pressure. He easily snapped Wu Changshan’s neck, as if snapping a sponge.

“Big brother!”

Seeing Wu Changshan dead, the fourth and sixth elders roared and rushed forward. But Su Yu Jian blocked them.

Actually, Su Yu Jian had infinite faith power and a half-life artifact. His strength was slightly stronger than Su Nantian’s, though he lacked the same diversity of methods.

At this moment, facing them directly, he could hold off the fourth and sixth elders without losing.

“Want to save him?”

Su Nantian held Wu Changshan’s corpse and smiled at the fourth and sixth elders.

Before they could answer, he shook his hand, throwing Wu Changshan’s corpse into the fire column he had created.

“You!”

The fourth and sixth elders wanted to say more, but Su Nantian gave them no chance. Their cultivation was slightly lower than Su Nantian’s, and with Su Yu Jian nearby, it was even worse.

If Wu Changshan hadn’t set up the formation to ambush Su Nantian, this battle wouldn’t have had so many twists.

When Wu Changshan died, the fight was over.

With Su Yu Jian’s help, they quickly killed the fourth and sixth elders on the spot.
