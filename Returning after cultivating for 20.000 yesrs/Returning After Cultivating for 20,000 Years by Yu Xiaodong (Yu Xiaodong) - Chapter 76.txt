"Su Nantian didn't bother overthinking it. He let out a cold laugh, 'You say he's the Wu family's heir candidate? You think I'd believe that? If you wanted me to call them, I would.'

"They've already boarded the plane. You know planes don't allow calls."

"Wu Bing seemed to have anticipated Su Nantian's reaction. He suddenly pulled out a letter from his bag and handed it to Su Nantian."

"What's this?" Su Nantian furrowed his brow.

"Wu Tao left it for you," Wu Bing explained. "Open it, and you'll know why. You should recognize his handwriting, right?"

"He left me a letter?" Su Nantian didn't hesitate. He tore it open immediately."

"Xiaotian, I and your aunt have left for the Wu family in Kyoto. There are some matters that need to be revealed to you now."

"I'm actually a member of the Wu family in Kyoto. I've kept this secret from you and You'er for so long. I'm sorry, but there are reasons I can't explain now..."

"This time we're going to Kyoto. Don't worry about our safety, and don't come looking for us. Take care of You'er instead. Don't let her find out about this, or with her personality, she might drop out of school to come looking for us."

"Don't worry. Wu Tao."

After reading the entire letter, Su Nantian's brow furrowed deeply. The handwriting was indeed Wu Tao's, and it seemed written with ease—clearly not under duress. This eased his mind slightly.

Yet he remained puzzled. Why had Wu Tao left the Wu family years ago, and why was he being summoned back now? What was the real reason?"

After tucking the letter away, Su Nantian looked at Wu Bing and said, "You say you're my aunt. I'll call you that. Can you tell me the real reason?"

"Ah." Wu Bing sighed, his expression one of helplessness. "I wish I could tell you some things, but telling you would only put you in danger. You've seen Wu Tao's letter—just take care of You'er and don't dwell on it. If you face any issues with money or other matters, feel free to reach out to me."

As he spoke, Wu Bing handed Su Nantian a business card.
"I'll take care of You'er's matters. No need for you to worry."

Su Nantian pocketed the card, his face expressionless. "If you won't tell me, then I'll find out myself!"

"Don't act recklessly," Wu Bing said earnestly. "Though you defeated Chen Yun, you do have some strength. But compared to the Wu family, your power is nothing. There are countless stronger people in the Wu family. If you go there now, it won't help them at all—it'll only endanger them!"

"I've said all I can. Whether you listen or not is up to you."
With that, Wu Bing glanced at his watch and then at Su Nantian. "It's late. I have some matters to attend to. I'll be going now. You should return home as well, don't let You'er worry."

After getting into the car, Wu Bing said to Su Nantian, "Tell your brothers to clear the way."

Zhang Bao and others looked at Su Nantian, asking weakly, "Should we?"

Before this, Zhang Bao and his group had been extremely arrogant. They numbered in the hundreds—how could they lose to just a dozen people?

But now, knowing these people came from the Wu family in Kyoto, they realized their gap and understood this wasn't something they could interfere with.

Su Nantian remained silent, feeling the letter in his pocket before saying, "Make way."

"Brothers, make way!" Zhang Bao quickly shouted.
The group moved the cars blocking the road. Three SUVs drove off confidently, leaving Su Nantian and Zhang Bao's group alone at the scene.

"Zhang Bao, you all go back first. Tell your brothers to disperse," Su Nantian said to Zhang Bao.
Zhang Bao nodded and had his men leave.

"Big Brother, how should we handle this?"
Zhang Bao remained behind as Su Nantian pulled out a cigarette and lit it.

"How should we handle it?"
Su Nantian took a deep drag, then sighed bitterly. "What do you think we should do?"

"I think we should listen to your aunt," Zhang Bao said weakly. "Your uncle left you a letter, and she just said the same thing. Plus, he is indeed part of the Wu family. If he returns, they probably won't have safety issues..."

Su Nantian said nothing. Safety could be guaranteed, but what about other matters?
This time he had come to Hangcheng not just to ensure the Wu family's safety, but to let You'er's family live well.
Though his aunt Wu Bing said she had brought Wu Tao back, the chaos in the Wu family clearly wasn't just a simple return.
Moreover, if the Wu family truly valued Wu Tao, they wouldn't have let him suffer for so long.
Su Nantian was certain that even if Wu Tao returned to the Wu family this time, his treatment wouldn't be good. Otherwise, why would Wu Bing say that going to Kyoto for help would only harm them?
That meant the Wu family still hadn't accepted Wu Tao's existence. Otherwise, Wu Bing wouldn't have said that!
"Go back," Su Nantian said. "Let me be alone for a while."
He didn't want to talk more with Zhang Bao. "By the way, don't let your sister know about this!"

Chapter 367: Confusion and Doubt
"Big Brother, rest assured. I'll make sure my men keep quiet!"
Zhang Bao knew the importance of this matter. After that, he drove off, leaving Su Nantian alone at the highway exit, smoking in silence.
Su Nantian stood by the roadside, feeling the cold wind and gazing at the starry night sky. His face wore a bitter smile.
He had thought this task would be easy, but now it seemed more complicated than he'd anticipated.
"Seems like living a normal life isn't easy either..." Su Nantian's brow furrowed deeply.
He had calculated everything, but he hadn't expected Wu Tao to be a member of the Wu family in Kyoto.
As one of the top ancient martial arts families in China, even a single department or hall within the Wu family was beyond his current ability to handle. Unless he used the Dragon Group's power, but that would be too disgraceful for him to do.
At this moment, Su Nantian's gap with the Wu family was too vast. Of course, that didn't mean he would give up easily. He just lacked the strength now—nothing meant he wouldn't have it in the future.
"Ah, rest assured. I'll take care of You'er," Su Nantian said, gazing into the distance and taking a deep breath. "I'll definitely go to Kyoto and bring you back. If you've suffered any injustice in the Wu family, I'll make them pay tenfold!"
With that, Su Nantian flicked the cigarette end and returned to his car.
After leaving the highway, he first went back to the hotel to confirm You'er's safety.
Once he confirmed she was asleep, he left the hotel and drove home to tidy up the mess.
Otherwise, when You'er returned tomorrow, seeing the house's state might make her worry again.
At the same time, Su Nantian was also troubled about what excuse to use.
No one knew how long it would take for him to go to Kyoto and bring Wu Tao back. It was likely a long process.
These two had disappeared for so long; with You'er's personality, she would definitely suspect something. He needed a solid excuse.
After half an hour of tidying the house, he took a shower and returned to his room. It was already one in the morning.
He lay on the bed, furrowing his brow deeply and spending a sleepless night.
At seven o'clock the next morning, Su Nantian was woken up by a phone call. He looked at it and saw it was You'er calling.
"Big Brother, have you found my parents yet?"
After answering the call, he heard You'er's worried voice on the other end. "Did our house really get robbed? Why are my parents' phones still disconnected? Are they really kidnapped?"
"Yuer, don't think it's that bad," Su Nantian smiled and said lightly. "Don't overthink it. Stay at the hotel for now, I'll come get you later. Today is Saturday, right? There's no class?"
"There isn't. But there's an important lecture by a professor tomorrow, and I have to attend."
You'er asked again. "Where are my parents? Have you found them yet?"
"Of course, I have." Su Nantian smiled. "Don't talk now. When I get to the hotel, I'll tell you what happened."
"That's good. I thought something really bad had happened to them."
Hearing Su Nantian say that, You'er also felt relieved. "I'll hang up then. I drank too much last night and still feel a bit dizzy."
"The hotel has breakfast, you can ask them to prepare some porridge..."
"Okay, I know."
After hanging up, Su Nantian got out of bed and quickly washed up before driving to the hotel where You'er was staying.
Honestly, he felt a bit nervous. He had never lied to anyone before—this was his first time lying, and it was a kind lie. He didn't know if the little girl would believe it.
"Hope You'er believes me..."
Su Nantian parked the car outside the hotel and got out.
At the hotel, he found You'er applying makeup.
"You'er, what are you doing with makeup?" Su Nantian asked curiously.
"Big Brother, you're here?"
You'er turned around and stuck out her tongue. "I'm not wearing makeup, just a light one. Girls always need to wear some when going out, right?"
"Are you going out today?" Su Nantian asked.
You'er nodded. "I have a date with my classmates..."
"Again with your classmates?" Su Nantian's brow furrowed, recalling the events of the previous night.
"Wouldn't it be some bad classmates again?"
"No," You'er quickly explained. "It's my best friend, a girl. We made plans to visit the museum today."
"Ah, I see," Su Nantian said and relaxed slightly. "Visiting the museum is fine. You can get to know our nation's long history and culture."
"Big Brother, you haven't told me about my parents yet," You'er asked while applying makeup.
Su Nantian smiled faintly. "Why the rush? Finish your makeup first. You haven't had breakfast yet, right? I'll get you some porridge."
"Okay," seeing Su Nantian's relaxed demeanor, You'er also felt relieved.
In the morning, she had been unable to reach her parents' phone and was worried to death. But now seeing Su Nantian so relaxed, and he had already said he found her parents in the phone call. She thought it wouldn't deceive her, so she let go of her worries.
After a while, Su Nantian returned to the room. Ten minutes later, a server brought two bowls of porridge and some other breakfast items.
While having porridge, You'er asked again.
Su Nantian knew he couldn't avoid it anymore and had to speak up. "Yuer, I found your parents, but they've already left Hangcheng. They took the plane to Kyoto last night."
You'er heard this and asked confusedly, "Why didn't they tell us before leaving? And why go to Kyoto so suddenly?"
"That's because your parents received the news suddenly and didn't have time to tell us," Su Nantian shrugged helplessly. "Your family's relatives are almost all on your mother's side. I suppose you've never met any of your father's relatives before?"
"Really!" You'er was surprised. "I've never met any of my father's relatives before. I didn't notice it, but now looking at it, it feels strange. But why are you bringing this up? Does it have anything to do with your parents suddenly leaving for Kyoto?"
"Yes, they decided to go to Kyoto suddenly because relatives on your father's side found them. They asked if they wanted to work, offering a salary of ten thousand."
"What? Ten thousand salary?" You'er's mouth opened wide, looking disbelieving. "Your father's relatives are so kind? They would entrust such an important job to them? But I still don't understand why their phones are still disconnected."
"They left in a hurry, and because they took the plane, it's normal to be disconnected last night."
Su Nantian smiled faintly.
"Why is it still disconnected now?"
"Maybe they ran out of battery."
Su Nantian continued. "Also, I heard this job has some confidentiality, so they rarely use their phones. It's likely they won't be reachable for a long time."
"No way," You'er looked troubled. "Why did your parents leave so suddenly? Even if the salary is high, they can't just abandon their daughter?"
"Isn't there me?" Su Nantian smiled. "Yuer, rest assured. I'll take care of you. This time I came back to let you and them live well. That day won't be far off. Now, just focus on your studies."
"Big Brother, I believe you," You'er nodded and truly believed what Su Nantian said.
Actually, if one were to scrutinize Su Nantian's words carefully, there were too many flaws. But You'er didn't think twice and chose to believe Su Nantian unconditionally, because he was her family, her brother. How could he deceive her?
"Yuer, I'm sorry for lying to you to keep you from worrying," Su Nantian felt a bit guilty as he watched You'er drinking porridge.
If only his strength was stronger, he wouldn't have had to watch his parents be taken away.
If he were strong enough, he could directly storm the Wu family in Kyoto and retrieve them. Unfortunately, his current strength wasn't enough.
The Wu family was one of the top ancient martial arts families in China, and it was truly too strong. Not only did they have countless people stronger than him, but even those at the innate level were as numerous as cows.
Su Nantian had only just reached the eighth level of cultivation, and above that were ninth level, full maturity, then innate...
According to his guess, the top ten ancient martial arts families in China had many old masters at the innate level. The Wu family, being one of the top families, was even more likely to have such strong individuals.
Therefore, he had to be careful and never act recklessly.
After chatting for a while, when You'er finished her breakfast, Su Nantian took her back home. She said she needed to go back for something and then meet up with her classmates.
After You'er left the house, Su Nantian looked at the empty room and sighed in relief. At least she believed him, but he was still worried because this couldn't be kept secret forever.
He had to bring Wu Tao back as soon as possible, not just to retrieve them but also to find out their situation in the Wu family. If he could get them to call You'er, it would resolve many of her doubts.
"Wu family..." Su Nantian clenched his fists tightly. To him, the Wu family in Kyoto was truly terrifying.
But what could he do? No matter who it was, if they dared to harm a single hair of his family, he would make them regret it!
"Seems like I need to quickly develop my own forces in Hangcheng," Su Nantian's eyes sparkled.
In the evening, Su Nantian called his aunt Wu Bing to see if he could contact his parents through her.
Wu Bing did answer the call, but as before, she didn't reveal much. The only thing that slightly eased Su Nantian's mind was Wu Bing guaranteeing his parents' safety. As long as their safety was secured, everything else wasn't a problem.
Even if they suffered some injustice during this time, he could settle the score once he had enough strength to confront the Wu family.
After finishing his call with Wu Bing, Zhang Bao's phone rang again. He said that Han Ji, who had been beaten up by Su Nantian before, wanted to apologize.
Han Ji had a mansion with a new renovation, and it hadn't been lived in yet. It had already been transferred to Su Nantian's name by Zhang Bao, and the address was sent to his phone. Zhang Bao wanted him to go there to receive it.
Su Nantian thought for a while. The three-story house of the Wu family was too unsafe, as it could be entered and exited at will. Plus, after the previous incident, neighbors had been whispering about it.
Not to mention safety and reputation, just living in his old house might make You'er miss her parents.
Plus, he wanted to let You'er live well and move into a villa was definitely a good idea. It would be better to switch now.
Thinking this way, Su Nantian sent a message to You'er and drove his Porsche to pick her up, heading towards the address on his phone.
"Big Brother, where are we going? So mysterious, even I can't know?" You'er asked curiously while looking out the window.
Su Nantian smiled and teased, "Guess!"
You'er pouted and hit Su Nantian's shoulder. "How can I guess? Just tell me, tell me!"
"Okay, we're going to our new house!" Su Nantian couldn't resist You'er's flattery and accidentally let it slip.
"New house? Did you buy a new house?" You'er's eyes lit up and kept asking.
"Once we get there, you'll know." Su Nantian smiled but didn't reveal anything.
This was the outskirts of Hangcheng, surrounded by hills and fields with fresh air and beautiful scenery.
At the end of the cement road in front of Su Nantian and You'er was the entrance to a mansion. Through the iron gate, they could see lush flowers and plants, as well as grand and beautiful architectural outlines. You'er's voice trembled as she asked, "Where is this?"

Chapter 369: New House
Su Nantian looked at the courtyard and nodded in satisfaction. He turned to You'er and said, "Where do you think this is? Of course, it's our new home."
"This is our house? It's a bit too big," You'er's shock was evident. How much would this cost?
"It is a bit large, but I'll have Zhang Bao send some people to protect it."
"But I feel like this is a dream," You'er felt her legs weaken. She thought the mansion of Shi Yunlan was already luxurious, but compared to this one, it was nothing.
Su Nantian shook his head helplessly and pulled You'er's hand, walking towards the villa.
At the iron gate's camera, the security guard quickly opened the door. The grand building was revealed before them.
The pebbled path in front of the villa had been replaced with a lawn by Zhang Bao's idea, to distinguish it from Han Ji's original villa.
Unexpectedly criticized by You'er, Su Nantian coughed twice and quickly bypassed the European Cupid fountain in front of the yard, approaching the villa's door. He smiled, "Come on, what's outside is just a snack; the real meal is inside!"
Su Nantian had already seen Zhang Bao's introduction and photos, but he was still happy and excited.
You'er suppressed her excitement and slowly approached the villa's door, saying to Su Nantian, "Why so urgent? I still..."
Before she could finish, You'er was enchanted by the scene after Su Nantian opened the door.
The floor was a spacious and luxurious marble, with an extremely luxurious crystal chandelier hanging overhead. It was complemented by a series of transparent and sparkling crystal decorations, giving the feeling of being in a crystal palace.
The center of the living room was surrounded by a set of vintage luxury leather sofas, with handmade and exquisite carpets on the floor. Walking barefoot was a pure enjoyment.
The living room had a black jade tea table in the center, and the overall atmosphere was simple yet elegant. A few green plants and flowers created an exquisite ambiance.
You'er looked around at everything, feeling like she was dreaming. She pinched herself hard and winced in pain: "It's really not a dream."
Su Nantian felt a pang of sorrow as he watched the little girl's silly actions.
"Yuer, rest assured. I'll make sure you live like a princess," Su Nantian gently patted You'er's shoulder and comforted her.
The living room had two large floor-to-ceiling windows, one leading to a swimming pool and the other to a bar. Behind the bar was a glass cabinet filled with various expensive wines.
"This is actually a kitchen, and the counter outside looks like a bar. Let's go upstairs to see your room?"
The gym, collection room, and study had all been taken over by Su Nantian.
You'er looked at each room and asked Su Nantian, "Big Brother, there are so many rooms. Which one is mine?"
Su Nantian smiled, "Other than the one on the outside, you can choose any."
"I don't need so many rooms. You should save it for your future sister-in-law!"
You'er chose a pink and girlie room, one of the special rooms designed by Zhang Bao.
Su Nantian felt grateful and naturally showed off to You'er.
The main bedroom had a huge, eye-catching bed in the middle of the wall, with softness and size as its main features.
A white piano stood quietly in the corner of the wall, and You'er lightly touched the keys. Her hands trembled slightly, filled with disbelief.
Seeing You'er's reaction, Su Nantian sighed helplessly. He had heard Wu Lianxing mention this before. You'er had always dreamed of learning the piano but couldn't due to poverty.
He thought about this and instructed Zhang Bao to specially select a piano from the music store as a surprise for You'er.
You'er felt wrapped in immense happiness, and her long-forgotten regret now had a chance to be fulfilled. Joy and anticipation filled her heart.
Su Nantian saw You'er about to cry from happiness, so he smiled and asked, "Want to try it?"
You'er felt warm and nodded. Her delicate fingers touched the keys, producing a pure and pleasant sound.
The first piece she had ever heard as a child was played beautifully and smoothly by You'er's delicate fingers.
Su Nantian listened quietly, rarely having any skills he couldn't master. The saying "speak to people and speak to ghosts" applied here—when dealing with ruffians, he was a thug; when accompanying a lady, he could become a noble.
As the music played, Su Nantian seemed to see a graceful girl struggling for her dream. Regret, sorrow, and loneliness...
The beautiful melody ended calmly in You'er's enjoyment and hesitation. Su Nantian returned to reality and clapped gently.
You'er smiled slightly, turned around, and asked expectantly, "How was it?"
Su Nantian's eyes were full of admiration. He smiled and said, "It was great! The melody lingered in my mind for a long time. It was amazing!"
You'er's face turned red, and she lowered her head shyly. "Was it really that good?"
Su Nantian saw You'er's tone was low and shook his head, saying, "Yuer, you have a talent for the piano. I didn't expect a scholar to be so self-doubting. Ha!"
You'er's initial sense of inferiority gradually faded because of Su Nantian's words.
Su Nantian had intended to let You'er make up for her childhood regrets and learn the piano, but she refused. She said she wanted to study something related to finance instead.
She also asked Su Nantian to teach her, and Su Nantian was at a loss.
Those were just exaggerated talks he used to cover his identity, but they couldn't compare to the systematic disciplines in university.
So Su Nantian awkwardly said, "Yuer, you know I only have practical skills. Let me teach you financial management? I remember you studied this major in university, right?"
You'er smiled proudly. "Then you can't teach me, can you? If not, just admit it! I won't make fun of you!"
Admitting he was inadequate? Su Nantian's expression said, "You're joking." He smiled and said, "Okay, you're challenging me. I accept your challenge! I'll find someone to teach you financial management later!"
Su Nantian emphasized the words "financial management" and looked at You'er with a triumphant smile.
You'er wanted Su Nantian to admit defeat, but seeing him call for help, she immediately countered, "No, you can't hire someone to teach me."

Chapter 370: Investigation
Su Nantian looked at You'er with a strange smile. "I didn't say I guarantee you'll master it, just that you can learn. Why can't I call for help? Besides, I didn't plan to spend money on it anyway. Do you think I don't have friends who study economics?"
Su Nantian truly didn't have friends who studied economics, but Zhang Bao definitely did. That guy had extensive connections and knew many big bosses. Plus, Zhang Bao's various industries and companies had professional talents. Su Nantian just needed to ask Zhang Bao, and he would definitely get a satisfactory answer.
You'er wanted to challenge her brother, but Su Nantian only played a word game and solved the problem. A sense of defeat arose immediately.
Su Nantian smiled and gently smoothed You'er's furrowed brow, laughing, "Why be so self-deprecating? With your college entrance exam results, ten of me couldn't catch up. Besides, after you graduate from university, your eyesight and knowledge will gradually improve. Maybe I'll even need you to manage my company in the future!"
Su Nantian's words slightly eased You'er's frustration. At least, in the future, she wasn't a useless person relying on her brother. Perhaps she could really help her brother.
Thinking of this, You'er had an idea and said to Su Nantian, "Then when are you going to arrange for me to study? I'm already eager!"
The only way to quickly improve herself and protect herself was to avoid others' worries.
Su Nantian was slightly surprised, then suddenly understood. It was good that You'er had a desire to improve. If he just mobilized some resources and connections, she would quickly grow up. Perhaps she could even become a successful female entrepreneur.
Su Nantian smiled and said, "Let me ask later. If there's time, I'll help you. You also need to think carefully—what if you give up halfway? I can't be good with my friends."
Su Nantian wanted to talk to Zhang Bao first, not wanting You'er to be hurt. Also considering that You'er still had classes and needed to prioritize her studies, he needed to arrange the time carefully. He didn't want to lose the sesame and gain the gourd, so he first prepared a prevention plan. He wanted You'er to think carefully before making a decision.
You'er lowered her head and thought for a while, then looked up with determination. She said seriously to Su Nantian, "Don't worry, Big Brother. I'll do more watching, learning, and doing, and speak less."
Su Nantian laughed and gently rubbed You'er's hair. "If you're ready to endure hardship, that's fine. Don't be so formal. Even if you cause some losses or make a mess, I'll cover it up for you. So just stay calm and study hard."
You'er felt a bit relieved and her expression relaxed, but her eagerness to learn became even stronger. She earnestly told Su Nantian, "Then don't forget to help me ask."
Su Nantian laughed and said, "Don't worry. I'll never forget your matters. I remember it in my heart."
You'er nodded satisfied, her eyes on the piano. Her delicate hands gently touched the keys, and a soothing melody gradually poured out.
The next afternoon, You'er went to school. Su Nantian called Zhang Bao and knocked on the door.
Zhang Bao, holding a file folder, entered and saw Su Nantian smiling on the sofa. He quickly greeted with respect, "Big Brother, I'm here!"
"Ah," Su Nantian nodded and pushed the teacup on the table to Zhang Bao, indicating he should sit.
Zhang Bao sat with half his bottom on the sofa and took a sip of tea, praising, "Good tea!"
"Don't be so formal. You decorated the villa and my sister is satisfied. I'm also happy." Su Nantian smiled faintly.
"It's my honor to serve Big Brother!"
After receiving Su Nantian's praise, Zhang Bao was so happy he almost jumped off the sofa. He felt his efforts hadn't been in vain.
"Okay, let's get to the real matter. Did you bring it?" Su Nantian waved his hand and asked.
"Yes, this is his information." Zhang Bao's smile faded and he handed the file folder to Su Nantian.
Su Nantian took it, opened it, and saw a young handsome man's face.
This was Wen Ran's fiancé. Since Su Nantian had decided to target him, he needed to know his enemy and himself. So he asked Zhang Bao to investigate his information, and Zhang Bao immediately brought good news.
"Leng Zhifei?" Su Nantian murmured lowly.
Zhang Bao immediately introduced, "This man is the eldest son of Leng Boxiong, the boss of Tiehao Group in Hangcheng. He's said to have returned from overseas with academic achievements and took over part of Leng Boxiong's business. He has some success."
"Of course, this is just basic investigation. From what I know, he's actually a big aristocrat. He does well on the surface but has a very decadent private life and is easily angered. He's a typical rich aristocrat."
"Oh? Does he have any criminal record?"
Su Nantian scanned the photos of beautiful women connected to Leng Zhifei and asked Zhang Bao.
"Um, he has many drunk driving records. He once hit someone and killed them, then paid to have someone else take the blame. The victim didn't dare to speak up and had to suffer in silence."
Zhang Bao said, leaning closer to Su Nantian and whispering, "He also uses that thing. He's been a drug addict for years."
Su Nantian's eyes flashed with cold light. He had planned to use a gentle approach, but this Leng Zhifei was actually a beast wearing human skin. How could Wen Ran marry him and be thrown into the fire?
Thinking this, Su Nantian had even less respect for Wen's family. Even a prestigious family should know Leng Zhifei's nature.
But for the sake of Leng Family's huge estate and reputation, they had even ignored their own daughter, letting her walk into the tiger's mouth. It was truly heart-wrenching.
Su Nantian, lost in thought, didn't realize his sharp aura was gradually released. The temperature of the entire villa's living room dropped slightly, scaring Zhang Bao.
Even though he was a big boss, he felt intimidated by Su Nantian's aura and couldn't move.
"Are they about to get married?" Su Nantian asked coldly.
"Yes, in three days." Zhang Bao replied timidly.
"Prepare for it. I'll disrupt the wedding in three days!"
Zhang Bao was shocked. This was to openly embarrass the Leng family.
But since his big brother had made a decision, this little brother would naturally support him. Even if Su Nantian wanted to do something earth-shaking, he should be the vanguard.

Chapter 371: Wedding Ceremony
Three days later, Hangcheng's First Hotel. Today was a festive day. The son of the renowned Tiehao Group, Leng Zhifei, was getting married. His bride was Wen Rang, the second daughter of the Wen family. Two powerful forces had joined together, their strength so formidable that people looked on with awe.
Numerous wealthy and noble guests came to congratulate, their priceless cars coming and going. The hall was filled with distinguished guests.
Proudly standing at the hotel entrance, Wen Liang welcomed the guests. He watched people who had previously looked down on him now showing respect, and he felt even more confident that marrying his sister to Leng Zhifei was the right decision.
As for Leng Zhifei's private life, he didn't care at all. If a rich family's son could stay clean and not have too many women, that was fine. As long as he could connect with the Leng family's relationship, Wen Liang didn't care.
