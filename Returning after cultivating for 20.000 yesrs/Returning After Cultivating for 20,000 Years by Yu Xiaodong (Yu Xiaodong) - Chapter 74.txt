“Get out, you!” The man sneered at Su Nantian.

Su Nantian ignored him, unsure of who was involved and unwilling to act rashly.

His companion, seeing Su Nantian remain silent, growled: “You heard me! Are you deaf?”

“I won’t leave. What are you going to do about it?” Su Nantian scoffed.

The gang members, emboldened by their numbers, grew bolder. “You little brat really don’t know your place. I’ll show you my strength today.”

He signaled his men, who rushed forward to drag Su Nantian away. Before they could touch him, a spinning kick sent one sprawling.

The leader shuddered in fear. He’d assumed Su Nantian was just another street thug, but now he realized the man was a master. He quickly shouted for reinforcements, hoping to draw more people in. Su Nantian didn’t stop him—this was the perfect chance to find out who was behind it.

“Mo Ge, I… this kid started trouble,” one of the gang members stammered.

Mo Ge? Su Nantian recalled Zhang Bao’s mention of a man named Han Ji. Could there be another faction involved? The answer came swiftly.

“Useless,” Mo Ge muttered, turning to address someone else with obvious deference. This must be the real leader.

Mo Ge’s gang arrived in force, surrounding Su Nantian with dozens of henchmen. Su Nantian stood unshaken.

“Ji Ge, what should we do with this man?” Mo Ge asked cautiously.

“Do I need to teach you how to handle such matters?” Han Ji’s expression remained cold.

Su Nantian understood now. These were just pitiful underlings—no match for him. He found it amusing that Zhang Bao had paid so much for this task.

That smirk earned Han Ji a glare, his face twisting in irritation.

A car engine roared behind them. Mo Ge glanced up and hurriedly said, “Ji Ge, they’re here.”

Han Ji’s lips curled with a sly smile. “Kid, you got lucky today. Get out before I change my mind.”

Su Nantian didn’t argue. He had plenty of time to deal with them later.

His men reluctantly cleared a path, allowing Su Nantian to leave.

Zhang Bao arrived with his group, scanning the area but not seeing Su Nantian. His heart raced.

Though Su Nantian recognized Zhang Bao, he walked calmly toward him.

Zhang Bao’s eyes lit up. “Senior Brother, have you already fought them?”

“No, they don’t know who I am.”

“Good, you’re safe.”

Su Nantian glanced at Zhang Bao, who immediately realized his mistake and fell silent.

How could these lackeys even challenge Su Nantian? They were no threat. The group marched on.

“Ji Ge, look! Isn’t that the kid from before?” someone pointed out.

Han Ji finally realized he’d let Su Nantian go—his regret was bitter. He shouldn’t have shown mercy.

Two factions faced off, eyes burning with hostility.

Zhang Bao and Han Ji each had over a dozen men behind them. The difference was Han Ji’s group included a towering figure with an ominous expression.

Chapter 357: Easily Handled

“Zhang Bao, I didn’t expect you to dare come here,” Han Ji sneered.

“Hmph. Don’t act like a righteous man. If it weren’t for your threats against my men, I wouldn’t be here,” Zhang Bao retorted.

“I’ve brought the top five in Hanghai. You’re dead tonight.”

“Top five? Just a brainy fool with no common sense,” Su Nantian scoffed.

“You! I already gave you a chance, now you’re back for more? Don’t blame me,” Han Ji said, stepping back.

Su Nantian signaled Zhang Bao to retreat. Only the so-called top five and Su Nantian remained.

They said nothing. As soon as the opponent moved, Su Nantian stood like a mountain. When the enemy closed in, one punch sent them sprawling.

Yes, just one punch.

Su Nantian’s strike was simple but lethal. If he hadn’t held back, the so-called top five would’ve met their end.

The man was knocked to the ground without a sound, his chest crushed. Su Nantian frowned—this must be a fake top five.

If Hanghai’s top five were this weak, he’d have no words but despair. What level was this?

Zhang Bao watched the fight, noting Han Ji’s changing expressions. Han Ji turned pale.

“Everyone, attack!” Han Ji screamed desperately.

Su Nantian waved Zhang Bao off.

Crash after crash. His movements were lightning-fast, one opponent after another falling like leaves. Zhang Bao and his men stared in awe—was this even human?

Even Zhang Bao shivered, recalling how he’d once considered fighting Su Nantian directly. That had been suicide. Fortunately, he’d changed his mind in time; otherwise, Hanghai might never have known the name “Zhang Bao.”

Within three minutes, Su Nantian had defeated all of Han Ji’s men. Han Ji stood frozen in terror, his legs trembling with fear.

Who could outrun Su Nantian?

“Leave the rest to you. I’ll go get a smoke first,” Su Nantian said, ignoring Han Ji and walking away.

Not long after, screams of pain and pleas for mercy echoed through the night. The moon hung high, bright and glaring.

About ten minutes later, Zhang Bao approached Su Nantian with a grin. “Senior Brother, do you have time?”

“Speak.”

“I’d like to treat you to a drink. Let the guys relax too.”

Su Nantian refused, but Zhang Bao’s persistence won through. The men around him looked at Su Nantian like a god, determined to keep him.

Reluctantly, Su Nantian agreed. Zhang Bao led them away without another word.

When Su Nantian passed the battlefield, Han Ji’s men were gone. Even the scent of blood had faded.

They arrived at a high-end club in Hanghai late at night. The music was loud, the crowd wild. People of all kinds filled the place.

Su Nantian glanced around, captivated by the dazzling lights and the women swaying on stage. His eyes narrowed as he spotted a familiar figure—Wu You’er!

She was seated at a nearby table, surrounded by young men and women playing cards. But his frown deepened when he noticed a few youths with dyed hair watching her intently.

Was this Wu You’er?

Though he doubted their intentions, Su Nantian didn’t rush to take her. What if he was mistaken? She needed social interaction.

Five or six boys with colorful hair and four or five girls in heavy makeup surrounded her. Wu You’er was the only one dressed modestly.

Time passed quickly. Su Nantian and Zhang Bao drank heavily, and the men kept coming to toast him. His head swam.

Drunk, Zhang Bao and his men let loose—dancing, flirting. Only Zhang Bao remained by Su Nantian’s side, but his mind was elsewhere.

From the start, Wu You’er never put down her glass. Every time she finished a drink, someone refilled it immediately.

Su Nantian’s eyes flashed with coldness. If this were a regular class reunion, it wouldn’t be so suspicious. But these “classmates” had ulterior motives.

Wu You’er raised her glass again, then stood up with a wobble. She tried to leave but was pulled back down by the group.

They pushed and shoved, insisting she drink. After repeated refusals, she finally took the glass with a frown.

Through lip-reading, Su Nantian understood the message: “Drink this last glass before you go.”

As the drink was passed, the man touched her roughly, even wrapping his arm around her waist.

Drunk? Su Nantian didn’t think so. He coldly stood up and walked toward Wu You’er.

But as he took a step, his face turned icy. He saw someone slipping a pill into her glass.

“Youshi, you can go if you finish this last drink,” a heavily made-up girl said sweetly.

“Fine, I’ll have this last one,” Wu You’er hesitated but relented when everyone watched her. She raised the glass, determined to finish it and leave this place.

To be honest, Wu You’er already regretted coming. She’d thought it was just a class reunion. But now she realized it had been a setup at the bar, and they’d forced her to drink so much. It was making her head ache.

She also sensed something was off—these people were clearly trying to get her drunk. The dyed-haired youths’ stares made her uncomfortable.

“Never mind, I’ve already had so much. I’ll finish this one and leave,” she thought, raising the glass with the pill.

Chapter 358: A Trap

At that moment, the girls in front of her all smiled slyly. Su Nantian’s eyes darkened further.

These people had conspired together. If it were just the boys, that would be one thing—but these girls were involved too.

They all wanted to take advantage of his little sister. That was foolish.

“Youshi, don’t drink,” Su Nantian rushed forward to stop her.

“Senior Brother?” Wu You’er slightly sobered, turning around. She smiled: “Big Brother, how come you’re here too?”

“Having a drink with some friends.”

Su Nantian approached, suppressing his anger. “Youshi, don’t drink. Go home quickly.”

“You bastard, who the hell are you?” One of the dyed-haired youths snapped. His eyes burned with hostility.

His name was Huang Penghui, son of a trade company boss in Hanghai. He was also Wu You’er’s college classmate. This drug plan had been his idea.

Huang Penghui had long desired Wu You’er. He’d proposed to her over ten times, but she always refused, citing studies. Now he had the chance to lure her out. If she drank that pill, he could take advantage of her.

At this critical moment, Huang Penghui couldn’t allow anyone to interfere. He signaled his men.

One of them shouted at Su Nantian: “We’re classmates having a drink. What are you doing here? Before we get angry, leave quickly.”

“Classmates?” Su Nantian sneered. From Wu You’er’s reaction, he doubted any of these people were real classmates.

At least the dyed-haired youths clearly weren’t Wu You’er’s classmates.

“What do you mean, a stranger? This is my brother,” Wu You’er frowned at Huang Penghui’s group.

“What, this is your brother?” The group turned pale. One whispered to Huang Penghui: “Huang Shao, this guy is Wu You’er’s brother. What now?”

“Hmph. Even if he is her brother, I’ll still make her drink this glass!” Huang Penghui hissed. “This pill cost me two thousand yuan. It’s a rare drug from abroad. Once she drinks it, she’ll lose her mind and obey me completely. She’ll be my toy.”

“What? That drug is so powerful?” The other youths were shocked.

Huang Penghui was proud. “Of course. You think I spent so much to get it? It’s a new drug from overseas. I only managed to get one.”

“Don’t worry, once this is done, when I’m bored, I’ll let you play with her too.”

“Really? That’s great!” The other youths’ eyes lit up, their gazes on Wu You’er even more intense.

Huang Penghui and his men whispered, not hiding from Su Nantian. They thought he couldn’t hear them, but every word was clear to him.

Su Nantian’s expression froze. He hadn’t expected these people to have such evil plans, especially Huang Penghui, who was truly despicable.

This made Su Nantian’s anger grow. If there were no laws in China, Huang Penghui would’ve died ten times over.

Thankfully, he’d agreed to come with Zhang Bao tonight. Otherwise, Wu You’er might’ve fallen into their trap.

If that happened, the girl would carry lifelong trauma. Thinking of this, Su Nantian’s desire to kill grew stronger. His greatest limit was protecting those close to him.

Su Nantian valued loyalty and friendship. If someone targeted him, they were welcome to come. But if they aimed at others, that was a big mistake.

“Youshi, don’t drink. You’re already drunk. Let me take you home.”

Su Nantian didn’t want to cause more trouble, so he planned to take Wu You’er home first. But this couldn’t be allowed.

“You may be her brother, but you can’t just take her away. She’s an adult. What business is it of yours?” A girl with a cigarette in her hand stood up, prompted by Huang Penghui.

“We’re classmates. What’s wrong with having a drink and chatting? You have to interfere?”

“Drinking and chatting?” Su Nantian sneered, taking the glass from Wu You’er. He waved it at her. “Since you’re her classmate, how about you drink this glass instead?”

“I… I don’t want to.” The girl’s expression changed.

She wouldn’t have come if she hadn’t been forced by Huang Penghui and the promised rewards. She was here to help him get Wu You’er, and she’d seen the drug in the glass.

She wouldn’t drink it. The girl shook her head: “No, I won’t.”

“Why not?” Su Nantian smiled coldly. “Did you put a drug in it?”

“Stupid kid, don’t talk nonsense.” The dyed-haired youths turned pale. They exchanged glances, their eyes full of panic.

How did Su Nantian know they’d drugged the drink? Had he seen them do it?

They had been careful, and Su Nantian had come from the distance. The booth was dark, how could he have seen?

They couldn’t figure it out and didn’t want to think more. They wouldn’t admit they had drugged the drink.

“Even if you are her brother, you can’t insult us like that.” One girl said, clearly uneasy but avoiding eye contact with Su Nantian and Wu You’er.

Chapter 359: Anger

“We’re her classmates. How could we drug her drink? You think too badly of people.”

“There’s no one who isn’t evil,” Su Nantian said angrily. “You drugged my sister’s drink, and you think you can get away with it?”

“Big Brother, was the drink really drugged?” Wu You’er looked doubtful.

These were her classmates. Though she didn’t know all of them, it was hard to believe they would drug her drink.

But seeing Huang Penghui’s group’s expressions, she felt it was likely true.

“Kid, you can’t talk like that.” The boy sitting next to Huang Penghui, who had remained calm throughout, now spoke with a dark expression. “You saw us drug it? I think you’re trying to start trouble. Don’t think because you’re her brother, we won’t do anything to you.”

“Sorry, I saw it with both eyes.” Su Nantian raised his gaze. “If you say you didn’t drug it, how about you drink this glass instead?”

“I… why should I?” The boy looked down. “You want me to drink? Who do you think you are? You don’t know who you’re talking to. This is Huang Penghui, the son of a big boss in Hanghai’s foreign trade company. He has dozens of people under him. Are you sure you want to cause trouble here? Apologize to Huang Shao!”

“Apologize, I’ll apologize to your grandfather!” Su Nantian raised the drugged glass and smashed it over the boy’s head. It cracked with a loud sound, blood gushing from his forehead.

“You bastard! How dare you hit me? You’re dead!”

“You’ll be sorry for this. Even if you are Wu You’er’s brother, today you must kneel and apologize to us!” The other dyed-haired youths shouted angrily, grabbing bottles to surround Su Nantian.

“What’s going on?”

“Someone is causing trouble.”

The commotion drew a crowd. It also attracted Zhang Bao, who was nearby.

“Senior Brother, what’s wrong?”

Seeing the youths with bottles surrounding Su Nantian, Zhang Bao rushed over.

Su Nantian briefly explained. Upon hearing this, Zhang Bao exploded with anger: “What? Someone dared to target Wu You’er and drug her drink? They’re looking for death!”

“Senior Brother, I’ll handle this.”

Su Nantian shook his head. “No need. These little guys don’t require others. I can handle them alone.”

Zhang Bao didn’t argue. He remembered how Su Nantian had defeated dozens of people led by Han Ji before. This was trivial.

If he could handle dozens, these street youths were no problem at all.

“Kid, you dare to hit our boss. Kneel and apologize immediately!” The street youths shouted.

“What are you planning?” Wu You’er, seeing Su Nantian surrounded, felt nervous. After all, he was alone while they were many. Even if he was strong, four against one wasn’t easy.

At first, Wu You’er thought this way. But what happened next made her eyes widen in disbelief.

The youths with bottles were like chickens under Su Nantian’s hands, crying out in pain after just one touch.

“Get out…” Su Nantian roared.

Finally, Huang Penghui stood up with a grim face. He glared at Su Nantian before leaving, clearly not done.

“Wow, this kid is really tough. One person took down so many people. Is he a martial artist?” The bar crowd marveled, some women even flirting with Su Nantian.

“Senior Brother isn’t just strong—he’s invincible!”

Hearing the crowd’s comments, Zhang Bao sneered internally. “Just took down a few people and you’re so impressed? If you saw how he defeated dozens before, it would be even more exaggerated.”

Su Nantian didn’t care about the crowd’s reaction. He just wanted to take Wu You’er home quickly.

She had drunk so much, and she looked tipsy. She needed to go back and rest.

“Zhang Bao, I’ll go now. Take care,” Su Nantian said to Zhang Bao before leaving the bar with Wu You’er.

In the car, Wu You’er regained her composure. But her expression still showed difficulty accepting that some classmates had conspired with these people to trap her.

“Youshi, don’t go to such gatherings again,” Su Nantian said, shaking his head.

“I didn’t expect this. I thought it was just a regular class reunion,” Wu You’er said, her voice sad. “But when I arrived, it turned out to be a bar. I came in first, and Huang Penghui was already there. If I had known he would come, I wouldn’t have.”

“Hmph. He’s lucky,” Su Nantian said as he drove, thinking about Huang Penghui’s words. He regretted not having killed them.

“He’s a playboy. He’s targeted other girls before. Recently, he focused on me and kept pestering me even after I refused. Now he’s colluded with my classmates…”

“What? There was this?” Su Nantian’s eyes flashed coldly. He needed to go to Wu You’er’s school and deal with those who had bad intentions toward her.

Seeing Huang Penghui’s expression before he left, Su Nantian knew this man wouldn’t give up easily. To prevent him from having any ideas about Wu You’er, Su Nantian felt it necessary to thoroughly intimidate him.

He should find a time to resolve this matter.

Su Nantian glanced at Wu You’er in the passenger seat, feeling心疼: “Youshi, how many drinks did you have? Did you start before I came?”

“Not sure,” Wu You’er rubbed her head, which felt swollen. “I remember I was being forced to drink the whole time. When I realized, I couldn’t anymore. Actually, during the drinking, I felt something was wrong. How could a class reunion force you to drink like that? And only me?”

Chapter 360: Intrusion?

“After saying this, Wu You’er looked terrified. “Senior Brother, I’m glad you came. Otherwise, if I had drunk that drugged glass, who knows what would’ve happened.”

She didn’t want to imagine the rest. Just thinking about it made her skin crawl.

“I’m a bit dizzy. I want to sleep for a while.”

“Okay.”

Su Nantian nodded, looking at Wu You’er who had fallen asleep by the window. He whispered: “Youshi, rest assured. I promise no more incidents will happen to you.”

Vroom.

Su Nantian stepped on the gas, wanting to get Wu You’er home quickly.

But just as they reached a red light, someone knocked on his car window.

“Huh?”

Su Nantian turned around and saw a female traffic officer in uniform knocking on his window.

“Hello, please get out for inspection.”

The woman was young and beautiful, making people glance at her. She exuded a sharpness that made her seem very capable.

“Inspection? What for?” Su Nantian rolled down the window, confused.

But as he did so, the officer frowned and sniffed. “There’s a strong smell of alcohol!”

“You! Get out immediately. I strongly suspect you’re drunk driving. Please get out and cooperate with the inspection, or else the consequences will be serious.”

“Oops…” Su Nantian’s face changed. He had forgotten about this.

“I didn’t expect my first time drinking and driving to be caught so directly. I should probably drink less next time.”

Su Nantian thought this, but smiled at the officer. “Miss, I’m definitely a law-abiding citizen. How could I drink and drive? The strong smell of alcohol is from the person next to me who drank too much. I’m just taking her home…”

The female officer sneered and coldly ordered: “Whether you drank or not is your word. Get out now and cooperate with the inspection, otherwise it’ll be serious.”

She took out her walkie-talkie, preparing to call for backup.

Su Nantian saw this and his face darkened. If he was stopped by the police, it would be a problem. There’d definitely be more trouble.

Just then, the red light turned green. Taking advantage of her momentary distraction, Su Nantian stepped on the gas and sped off like a wild horse.

“Trying to run?”

The female officer was furious. She wanted to chase him on her motorcycle, but Su Nantian’s car was a Porsche and his driving skills were top-notch. A female officer on a motorcycle couldn’t catch him.

“Damn it, don’t let me meet you again. I’ll make you suffer,” she muttered as she watched Su Nantian disappear.

Meanwhile, Su Nantian confirmed he had shaken off the officer and sighed. “Oops, I almost forgot about checking for drunk driving on the road.”

Su Nantian shook his head. As a Chinese person, he felt it was necessary to abide by these rules.

Twenty minutes later, Su Nantian parked the car and helped Wu You’er back home. As he opened the door, he was stunned.

The house was in disarray, as if robbed. Everything had been turned upside down.

“Senior Brother, what’s going on? Why is the house so messy? Did we get robbed?” Wu You’er, who had been dizzy, suddenly sobered up.

“Dad and Mom, did the house get robbed?” Wu You’er shouted.

No one answered. Su Nantian’s face darkened as he checked each room but found no sign of Wu Tao and his wife.

“Strange, why aren’t Dad and Mom home at this hour?” Wu You’er asked confusedly. “Normally, they’d be in bed by now. Maybe the house was robbed and they went to report it?”

“No, we need to call them immediately.”

Wu You’er took out her phone. After a moment, she was even more puzzled: “Why are their phones off? I can’t call them.”

“Senior Brother, what’s going on? The house is so messed up. Mom and Dad aren’t here either. Did something happen to them?” Wu You’er looked worried.

Su Nantian’s expression was also grim. From the scene, something was definitely wrong.

“Youshi, don’t worry. I’ll find your parents.”

Su Nantian smiled to ease her worries and said, “Maybe their phones just ran out of battery. But the house was definitely robbed. It’s not safe to stay here tonight. Let’s check into a hotel and you can rest there.”

Su Nantian planned to put Wu You’er in a hotel before using Zhang Bao and his connections to find Wu Tao’s whereabouts.

He found a five-star hotel nearby and booked a room for Wu You’er.

“Senior Brother, you must find Mom and Dad.”

Wu You’er speculated: “What if they were robbed and kidnapped?”

“Don’t be silly,” Su Nantian smiled. “What are you thinking? Who would want to kidnap them? It’s just a house.”

“That’s true…” Wu You’er stuck out her tongue. “I’m exhausted, my head is dizzy. I need to sleep.”

“Okay, Youshi, you rest first.” Su Nantian smiled. “Once I’ve got the details straightened out, I’ll find them.”

Su Nantian reminded her: “Don’t run around after you wake up. Stay in the hotel and wait for my news.”

Wu You’er was too tired to talk, just nodded.

After making Wu You’er sleep soundly, Su Nantian left the hotel.

As he stepped out of the hotel, his expression darkened sharply—very ominously.

He couldn’t figure out what had happened. But considering recent events, the only person he could suspect was Han Ji.

But Zhang Bao had asked for his help. It was unlikely he would do this, but not impossible.

As for Han Ji, he had just been beaten up and was in the hospital. He wouldn’t have time to find out Su Nantian’s family details, so it was unlikely he was the culprit.

Chapter 361: Sudden Change

“No matter who it is, if they harm them, I’ll make you regret this decision!”

Though Su Nantian believed Zhang Bao wouldn’t do it, he still planned to use his help to find people.

Su Nantian returned to the car and called Zhang Bao.

This trip was personal, so he couldn’t freely use the Dragon Group’s resources. Plus, some things were better handled by Zhang Bao, a local.

At that moment, Zhang Bao was still at the bar, having drinks and flirting with girls.

His phone rang suddenly.

“Damn it, who the hell is it at this hour?” Zhang Bao was enjoying his drink and was annoyed by the call. He looked to see who it was.

His eyes widened when he saw the caller ID: “Su Nantian?”

Zhang Bao had no hesitation. He had seen Su Nantian defeat dozens of people alone and regarded him as a god, deeply admiring him.

Zhang Bao wondered why Su Nantian was calling at this hour. He had already gone home, right?

He thought but didn’t dare to delay and answered the call.

“Hey, Senior Brother, are you home?” Zhang Bao smiled.

“Yes, I’m home.”

Su Nantian’s voice was cold. “If I hadn’t gone home, I wouldn’t have known the house was messed up. It looked like it had been robbed. Everything was turned upside down, even my aunt and uncle were missing. Their phones are off too. Do you have anything to say?”

“What? There’s this kind of thing?” Zhang Bao was shocked. “Who the hell would dare to rob Senior Brother’s house? That guy is looking for death!”

He stopped mid-sentence, realizing something. “Senior Brother, do you suspect it was me, Zhang Bao?”

“Is it not you?”

“No, of course not.”

Zhang Bao quickly explained: “Even if Senior Brother gave me ten chances, I wouldn’t dare to harm your family. I may be a street rat, but I have limits. I know the saying ‘don’t harm family.’”

“Besides, Senior Brother, you helped me deal with Han Ji today. I’m grateful. How could I do such a despicable thing?”

“Senior Brother, do you think something happened to your aunt and uncle?”

“Do you think this is a coincidence?”

“Senior Brother, could it be Han Ji who did it?”

“Do you think it was him?”
