“ I don’t think so. Han Ji doesn’t even know who you are. Even if he wanted to retaliate, it wouldn’t be this fast.” Zhang Bao thought for a moment before shaking his head.

Su Nantian remained silent at first, then his voice sounded colder than ever before.

“Zhang Bao, you said you were powerful in Hangcheng. Even a single step would make the ground tremble. Let me see how good your skills really are.”

“I’ll give you one night to investigate their whereabouts. Otherwise, don’t expect me to help you again.”

Ding ding ding.

Having said that, Su Nantian hung up the phone without waiting for Zhang Bao’s reply.

“Big Brother Bao, who was that? Your expression is so serious,” a sultry woman approached from the distance, swaying her hips as she tried to get close to Zhang Bao.

Su Nantian felt irritated and vented his anger on the innocent woman: “Get out of here, you bastard!”

Zhang Bao shoved the woman aside. She fell onto the sofa with a thud, but knowing Zhang Bao’s strength, she said nothing and fled as quickly as possible.

“Big Brother Bao, what's going on? What made you so angry?” At that moment, Niu Meng approached with a whiskey in hand.

“Don’t drink. Something big has happened!”

Zhang Bao’s face was unusually serious: “Hurry and call all the brothers together. We need to act immediately.”

Niu Meng asked, “Big Brother Bao, what’s the big deal?”

Seeing Zhang Bao’s expression for the first time so serious, Niu Meng’s hand trembled slightly. The glass of whiskey nearly slipped from his grip. Was something big about to happen? Would Hangcheng change hands?

Even when he had clashed with Han Ji’s faction before, Zhang Bao hadn’t looked so serious. Seeing Niu Meng’s confusion, Zhang Bao quickly explained.

Niu Meng’s eyes widened: “What? Uncle Tian’s family is in trouble? That really is a big deal!”

“We can’t afford to waste time. We must investigate quickly. Who knows if something happens to them? If we find out too late, it’ll be too late.”

“Two hours. No, one hour—must find out within an hour and give Uncle Tian a clear answer.”

With that, Zhang Bao and Niu Meng immediately gathered all their subordinates, using every connection they had to start investigating the matter.

After calling Zhang Bao, Su Nantian realized he couldn’t rely solely on him. He took action himself.

He naturally wouldn’t entrust the entire matter to Zhang Bao, nor would he place all his hopes on others.

Su Nantian returned home again to check the surveillance cameras around the neighborhood, hoping to find some clues. But after checking, he felt a chill in his heart—he discovered the hard drives of the surveillance system had been destroyed. Clearly, someone had done it on purpose.

This made him more certain that someone was targeting his parents. He couldn’t figure out who would target Wu Tao’s family.

Could it be Shi Yunlan?

Earlier, at a gathering at Shi Tiantian's house, Su Nantian had humiliated many people in front of them, including Shi Yunlan, the big uncle.

Could this incident be orchestrated by Shi Yunlan?

After thinking it over, Su Nantian felt the possibility was low. Although Shi Yunlan’s group looked down on Wu’s family, they were still relatives. It was unlikely they would act secretly against them.

Moreover, the fact that the neighborhood surveillance had been destroyed without anyone noticing suggested it wasn’t something ordinary people could do.

But even if there was a slight possibility, he couldn’t ignore it. Without hesitation, Su Nantian drove to Shi Yunlan’s house.

This time, he was driving a new Porsche the company had acquired, which was much faster than his old Mercedes.

“Su Nantian! What are you doing? Are you crazy? This is my house. I’m your elder, and you dare to barge in without permission. You’re trespassing! Do you think I’ll report you?”

Shi Yunlan was shocked when Su Nantian entered his villa without being invited. He first felt startled, but then immediately became furious and trembled with anger.

Chapter 362: Struggling to Intercept

He hadn’t yet cooled off from being humiliated by Su Nantian in front of everyone. Now seeing him again, he was even more enraged.

“Hey hey, don’t get so worked up,” Su Nantian said emotionlessly. “I’m here to investigate some matters. Once I’ve figured it out, I’ll leave.”

“What did you say? You came to investigate?” Shi Yunlan said with a grim face. “This is my house. You entered without my permission and say you’re just investigating? What kind of investigation is that? Who do you think you are, a police officer? Even if you were a cop, you couldn’t barge into someone’s house without a warrant. Do you have one?”

“Dad, what’s all the noise?” At that moment, a person came down from upstairs—Shi Tiantian.

“You!” Shi Tiantian, wearing a nightgown, saw Su Nantian in the first-floor hall and immediately changed her expression. “Why are you here at my house?”

“This kid came in on his own,” Shi Yunlan said.

“Came in on his own?” Shi Tiantian heard this and said with some disdain, “So you’re just showing up without being invited again? What’s the matter that you came to our house at this hour? Did your family run into trouble and want us to help?”

“Back then, you Su Nantian were so arrogant. Now you’re coming back to ask for our help?” Shi Tiantian said, looking somewhat smug. “I thought you were so strong, but it seems you’re not much at all. Considering we are relatives, helping your family isn’t impossible. Just kneel down and apologize to us, and we’ll consider it.”

“Seems there’s no need for further investigation,” Su Nantian looked at Shi Tiantian standing at the staircase and ignored her completely.

From the reactions of Shi Tiantian and Shi Yunlan, it was clear that their family had nothing to do with these two. Since there was no connection, there was no need to stay here.

“Stop!” Seeing Su Nantian about to leave, Shi Tiantian shouted. “This house isn’t one you can just come and go as you please! If you want to leave, at least explain yourself first. I ask you—what’s your relationship with Zhang Bao? Why did Zhang Bao act like that toward you?”

Shi Yunlan also perked up his ears. He too wanted to know why.

Why would Su Nantian, a poor kid, be acquainted with Zhang Bao, such an influential person in Hangcheng?

“Nothing much. Zhang Bao just has something to ask of me,” Su Nantian said without looking back, speaking indifferently.

“Impossible! What kind of person is Zhang Bao? How could he have something to ask of you, a poor kid!” Shi Yunlan said with disbelief. Shi Tiantian also stared at Su Nantian’s back and laughed: “You really talk nonsense. Zhang Bao asking for your help? What are you thinking of yourself, that Zhang Bao would ask for your help? What do you have that others would need?”

Their words naturally reached Su Nantian’s ears. But he didn’t care; he didn’t want to bother with others’ opinions. As long as it didn’t interfere with his normal life or touch his底线, he was fine.

As for what these relatives thought of him, it had nothing to do with him. After all, he wouldn’t lose any flesh.

At the moment, it was more important to investigate Wu Tao’s whereabouts. After leaving Shi Yunlan’s house, Su Nantian continued his investigation.

Time passed quickly.

As half an hour had gone by without finding any clues, Su Nantian furrowed his brows deeply and took out his phone but put it back immediately.

He couldn’t help but not want to contact the Dragon Group. But if he had no choice, he would have to do it.

Ding ding ding…

At that moment, his phone rang. Su Nantian picked it up and saw it was Zhang Bao calling.

As soon as he pressed the answer key, he heard Zhang Bao on the other end say: “Uncle Tian, I’ve got news. I found out where your parents are.”

“What?” Su Nantian asked immediately: “Tell me quickly. What did you find out? Where are they? Are they okay?”

“Honestly, I don’t know the details,” Zhang Bao said on the phone. “According to what I heard, your parents were taken by someone and are now on their way to the airport via highway.”

“Indeed!” Su Nantian’s face darkened. It was exactly as he had suspected—Wu Tao’s parents were indeed taken.

The worst thing had happened.

But since they were heading to the airport, at least they were safe for now.

Thinking of this, Su Nantian felt a little relieved and said: “You must send people to intercept them on the highway. No matter what, I can’t let my parents be taken.”

“Uncle Tian, don’t worry. I’ve already mobilized everyone and sent them to intercept on the highway. No one will be taken into the airport.”

At 11 p.m., the exit of Hangcheng’s highway to the airport was completely blocked. More and more cars arrived, with people getting out of them until hundreds gathered around three off-road vehicles.

At that moment, a Mercedes arrived. Two people got out—Zhang Bao and Niu Meng.

“Big Brother Bao, Uncle Meng.” Hundreds of people saw them and greeted them in unison like thunder.

One person quickly said, “Big Brother Bao, as per your instructions, we’ve stopped them.”

“That’s good.” Zhang Bao sighed in relief. As long as they had stopped them, everything wasn’t a problem.

He looked at the three off-road vehicles surrounded by people and his expression was somewhat gloomy. He wanted to see who had the audacity to kidnap people in Hangcheng, and especially Wu Tao’s family. These people really didn’t know Su Nantian’s strength.

“Open the door, hurry up!” A subordinate shouted. But the three off-road vehicles wouldn’t open.

“Big Brother Bao, they won’t open. Should we smash the cars?” Another subordinate suggested.

“Don’t smash them, don’t do it,” Zhang Bao shook his head. Wu Tao’s parents were still in the cars.

If they were in one of these three vehicles, what if smashing the car injured someone? After all, they had already stopped them. There was no rush; it would be better to wait for Su Nantian to arrive before taking action.

Creak.

At that moment, the doors of all three off-road vehicles opened simultaneously. Several black-clad men got out.

These black-clad men were all tall and strong, giving a terrifying sense of oppression even with just a few standing there.

Chapter 363: Black-Cloaked Men

When the many subordinates saw these black-clad men, they instinctively took a step back.

One subordinate said with a changed face: “Big Brother Bao, these people seem tough. Who are they?”

Many subordinates didn’t know what was going on; they just received orders to intercept at the highway.

Zhang Bao’s face darkened: “Are you afraid?”

“No way, Big Brother,” these subordinates immediately laughed. “We have hundreds of people. Even if they are special, they’re just a few people. How could they stir up trouble with our hundreds?”

“Is that so?” One black-clad man raised his eyebrows and said indifferently. “If you think your numbers mean anything, then you’re wrong.”

This black-clad man spoke with calmness: “You must be the local boss of Hangcheng. Are you Han Ji’s people or Zhang Bao’s? No matter who your boss is, I advise you to leave immediately. Otherwise, take the consequences!”

“Who are you scaring?” “Do you think we’re scared of you?”

“Ha, I’m not scaring you. But before acting, didn’t you investigate who we are?” This black-clad man smiled coldly, showing a row of white teeth that contrasted with his skin tone. His expression made people feel uneasy.

“I’m curious, why are you blocking us?”

“Why?” These subordinates looked at each other in confusion. They really didn’t know why; they had just received Zhang Bao’s orders to act.

There was nothing strange about it. After all, the boss told the subordinates to act; they wouldn’t question the reason.

“Don’t you dare ask?” Zhang Bao stepped forward and said coldly: “You’re kidnapping people in my Hangcheng, even my brother’s family. Do you know what you’re doing?”

“Oh?” This black-clad man raised his eyebrows and said indifferently. “I didn’t realize that kid was your brother. You must be the leader of these people, Han Ji or Zhang Bao?”

“This is Big Brother Bao!” One subordinate shouted. “Watch your tone when you speak to Big Brother Bao!”

“What nonsense is this, Han Ji or Zhang Bao? In my eyes, they’re just kids,” another black-clad man spoke with a very hot temper. “Why waste words on these useless people? Just let them go!”

“Give you ten seconds to clear the way and disappear from our sight. Otherwise, this local boss will be erased from Hangcheng.”

“What did you say?” “Big mouth!”

Many subordinates became furious. Zhang Bao and Niu Meng also laughed coldly.

They had hundreds of people now, while the other side only had about ten. In such a big disparity, they still dared to say that. What did they base it on?

Did they really think ten people could fight against hundreds of them?

“Big Brother Bao, they look down on us. Let’s show them our strength!” Many subordinates couldn’t bear the open insult and were ready to fight.

Boom…

At that moment, a loud engine noise came from behind, followed by an urgent braking sound. This huge commotion naturally caught everyone’s attention.

They turned around and saw a Porsche stop smoothly with a sharp brake. At the moment the car stopped, a young man got out.

His expression was very gloomy—this was Su Nantian who had arrived after receiving the news!

“Uncle Tian?” “Why is Uncle Tian here too?”

Many subordinates were confused. Did this night’s action have something to do with Su Nantian?

While many subordinates were confused, Zhang Bao quickly approached and said: “Uncle Tian, you’ve finally arrived. I haven’t failed you! We’ve already stopped them!”

“Good,” Su Nantian nodded slightly and walked through the crowd of subordinates.

He immediately saw three off-road vehicles surrounded in the middle, with about ten black-clad men confronting Zhang Bao’s hundreds of subordinates.

At the moment he saw these black-clad men, Su Nantian’s pupils constricted. He realized that these people were all no ordinary individuals, especially one of them who exuded an extremely heavy aura.

This aura made Su Nantian’s face change slightly. He knew this person had definitely killed people before, and not just one. Otherwise, it would be impossible to have such an aura.

Su Nantian had lived through years of swordplay and knew how to judge a person well. Therefore, upon seeing these black-clad men immediately, he knew they were likely from a powerful background.

But what did it matter? Even if these people were powerful and had connections, daring to harm his family was tantamount to seeking death!

If Wu Tao’s parents suffered any harm, no matter who these people were, he would make them understand what regret and pain meant!

“Where are they?” Su Nantian asked anxiously.

“They haven’t appeared yet,” Zhang Bao replied quickly. “But I suspect they are in one of these three vehicles.”

“Uncle, Auntie, are you there?” Su Nantian shouted directly but received no response.

This made his face darken. Zhang Bao and Niu Meng also changed expressions: “No way, are they not in the cars? We did stop them immediately. According to logic, they should be there.”

“Maybe their mouths were tied with tape and couldn’t respond. Or maybe they were unconscious,” Niu Meng guessed.

Su Nantian didn’t think much and walked over to ask: “Where are they?”

“You’re Su Nantian, Wu Tao’s distant cousin?” One black-clad man looked at Su Nantian and said with some disappointment: “Indeed, as the rumors say, you’re an unremarkable kid. Hanging out with a bunch of hooligans is really embarrassing. If I were you, I’d run as far away as possible!”

Smack!

Before this man could finish speaking, his face was struck with a heavy slap. Su Nantian had given him a slap.

“You dare to hit me?” This man, after regaining his senses, looked with a sinister expression. He hadn’t expected to be hit by this small kid.

At the same time, he was shocked. What kind of skills did he have that Su Nantian could hit him without reacting?

Was it luck or a gap in strength? He couldn’t figure it out at the moment.

“Hit you!” Su Nantian said emotionlessly. “I don’t want to waste words with you. I’ll ask one more time—where are they?”

Chapter 364: Taking Action

“Su Nantian!” A somewhat thin man got out of one of the off-road vehicles and said to Su Nantian indifferently: “You’re not qualified to know these things. I advise you to go back where you came from. As for Wu Tao’s parents, don’t worry—they’ve gone to the place they should go.”

“Not qualified?” Su Nantian tapped his fingers: “How do you define being qualified? If I beat you, would that make me qualified?”

“Kid, what are you talking about?” “This is Chen Yun. Uncle Yun, you still want to fight with this kid? Do you know what he’s capable of?” “Considering you’re Wu Tao’s cousin, we don’t want to trouble you. If you insist on pushing your luck, I won’t mind showing you a little color!”

These black-clad men all laughed. Their eyes looked at Su Nantian as if he were a fool.

“Don’t talk about Yun Uncle, even one of us could make you lie on the ground for a long time.”

“Blah blah!” One subordinate of Zhang Bao immediately became upset: “Our Uncle Tian is so strong, how could you say that?”

One subordinate had seen Su Nantian beat up dozens of people from Han Ji before, so he was very confident in Su Nantian’s skills. At the same time, they understood why Zhang Bao was so concerned about this matter—these people had kidnapped Su Nantian’s family. That was tantamount to seeking death!

“Ah, you want to fight with me?” Chen Yun raised his eyebrows and looked interested: “Okay, I’ll use one hand. If you can beat me, I’ll tell you the truth!”

“Uncle Yun, are you really going to fight this kid?” Other black-clad men seemed a bit surprised: “To deal with such a waste, do you really need to use your hands? That’s like killing a chicken with an axe!”

“Silence!” Su Nantian rushed forward and kicked the person who spoke.

“You…” This person, after being kicked, became furious and got up from the ground, saying angrily: “Kid, you’re really looking for death. I was talking to you, and you dared to ambush me!”

“Uncle Yun, this kid must be shown a lesson. Even if he’s Wu Tao’s cousin, he needs to know not to offend the people who shouldn’t be offended. Otherwise, he won’t even know how he died!”

“Do you think I can teach you a lesson?” Su Nantian coldly smiled: “I admit, you are well-trained and have some skills. If we really fight, our hundreds of people might not be a match for you…”

“Not possible, Uncle Tian. Our hundreds of people can’t beat these ten people?” “Uncle Tian, are these people really that strong?”

Hearing Su Nantian say this, the subordinates on the scene were in disbelief. Those who had seen Su Nantian’s skills before thought it was likely true, but those who hadn’t witnessed his strength completely thought he was joking.

Many subordinates were seeing Su Nantian for the first time and whispered: “Who is this kid? Why does he talk nonsense? How can our hundreds of people not beat ten people? Is he really joking?”

“Shh, be quiet. This is Uncle Tian, Big Brother Bao’s benefactor!”

“But this kid looks thin and weak. How could he be so strong? Maybe he has a big background, like the son of a major figure on the street?”

“This isn’t it. Uncle Tian is very strong. Do you know that Han Ji sent dozens of people, and Uncle Tian defeated them all alone!”

“Not possible! This kid defeated Han Ji’s dozens of people alone?”

After hearing these words, many subordinates who didn’t know the truth looked at Su Nantian as if he were a god.

From Zhang Bao and Niu Meng’s reactions, they thought the situation was likely true. Otherwise, why would these two big brothers act like lambs in front of Su Nantian?

It must be that Su Nantian had subdued them with his strength.

“Want to teach me a lesson?” Su Nantian nodded and said emotionlessly: “Okay, you all come at me. Maybe there’s still a chance.”

“Haha…” “Bragging!”

“Looks like Wu Tao’s cousin is an idiot!” “I thought Wu Tao was an idiot, but now I see his relatives are also messed up!”

One black-clad man laughed coldly: “I said your uncle was an idiot, and you are too. What do you have to say about it?”

He really looked down on himself, being a professional-trained expert. These street-level hooligans could single-handedly fight over fifty people.

This was even without weapons. If he had a stick or something, the number would double!

That’s why they only had ten people but completely looked down on Su Nantian’s hundreds of people.

This black-clad man smiled with disdain, but the next moment he couldn’t laugh anymore.

Boom!

A heavy punch came at him, knocking him off balance and making his head spin.

“Fast speed!” Other black-clad men were shocked. Even Chen Yun, the thin man, was surprised and looked at Su Nantian again: “It seems I misjudged you. You do have some strength, but it’s still not enough for me to take seriously.”

“You think this level of strength makes you qualified to know the truth? That’s too much wishful thinking!”

“I’ll say it again. I only use one hand to fight with you. If you can defeat me, then you’ll be qualified to know some things.”

The thin man looked at Su Nantian indifferently: “Of course, if you don’t have the confidence, I can lower my requirements. How about this: if you can touch me within two minutes, I’ll lose.”

“No need for that,” Su Nantian said emotionlessly: “No need to be so complicated.”

Swoosh…

As he spoke, Su Nantian moved his feet and rushed toward him. At the moment of rushing towards this person, he raised his fist.

“Trivial skills.” The thin man looked at Su Nantian with disdain and simply watched him rush toward himself, as if allowing Su Nantian to attack.

“Why isn’t he moving?” Zhang Bao’s many subordinates were confused. These black-clad men laughed coldly: “This kid is crazy, actually daring to fight with Yun Uncle. He really doesn’t know the limits!”

Chapter 365: The Wu Family of Jingdu

“We have ten people, and we still can’t beat Yun Uncle. This kid if he defeats him, I’ll eat shit right here!”

One black-clad man seemed to have full confidence in Chen Yun and spoke without hesitation.

But the next moment, he couldn’t speak anymore.

Boom!

After a heavy sound, a figure flew backward. This flying figure was none other than the thin man Chen Yun!

“What?” “Impossible, Chen Yun wasn’t a match for this kid?”

“What’s going on? According to our investigation, this kid is just Wu Tao’s distant cousin. When did he get such skills?”

Many black-clad men were shocked and hadn’t expected the situation to develop this way.

But Zhang Bao’s group remained relatively calm, as many had already seen Su Nantian’s skills before.

“You kid…” The thin man who fell to the ground was furious, his eyes filled with resentment. He couldn’t accept that he had been knocked down by Su Nantian.

He immediately got up and tried to attack again, but before he could even stand properly, his chest was hit with a heavy kick.

Boom!

This kick made Chen Yun fall over completely. He felt pain all over his body, and he struggled on the ground for a while but couldn’t get up.

“Brave!” This scene made other black-clad men furious. They all clenched their fists, ready to attack Su Nantian in a group.

Su Nantian saw this and smiled coldly: “Come at me all together. That’ll save some time.”

“Kid, don’t be so arrogant!” These black-clad men were furious and couldn’t accept that the kid who they had looked down on before now possessed such strength, defeating Chen Yun.

So it seemed that Su Nantian had the strength to defeat any one of them. This was something they couldn’t accept.

After exchanging glances, it seemed they had made a decision to attack together and teach Su Nantian a lesson.

But at that moment, a cold voice rang out: “Enough!”

This cold voice was from the innermost of one of the off-road vehicles.

After hearing this voice, the black-clad men stopped and didn’t dare to move. Obviously, the person who spoke had absolute authority.

“Hmm?” Su Nantian frowned and looked over as well.

A woman got out of the off-road vehicle. She was well-preserved, looking about thirty years old. Her whole body exuded elegance and dignity, with a noble and high-class atmosphere—clearly someone from a prestigious family.

This woman looked about thirty, but Su Nantian immediately realized her real age was over forty. She must have used expensive skincare products frequently to look so young.

Moreover, seeing her attire and the black-clad men’s attitude toward her, Su Nantian could guess that this woman had a very unusual background.

“Bing Jie.” The thin man and other black-clad men called this woman “Bing Jie.”

This woman nodded slightly and walked over, ignoring others and directly approaching Su Nantian.

“Why are you doing this?” Zhang Bao shouted, worried that the woman might do something dangerous to Su Nantian. Su Nantian raised his hand, indicating it was fine. He wanted to see what the woman’s plan was.

“Did you kidnap my uncle and aunt?” Su Nantian looked at this woman who called herself “Bing Jie.”

Bing Jie approached and, after looking at Su Nantian deeply, said unexpectedly: “Kid, by lineage, I am your aunt.”

“What?” Su Nantian heard this and furrowed his brows: “You are my aunt? When did I have such an aunt?”

Although Su Nantian wasn’t truly Wu Tao’s nephew, he had done some research on the Wu family background and had a certain understanding. According to his investigation, Wu Tao should be an only child. When did he have a sister?

But his intuition told him that this woman wasn’t lying.

“Not right!” Su Nantian suddenly remembered. He had known Wu family relatives before, but they were all from Shi’s side. He hadn’t noticed Wu Tao’s relatives before. Now thinking about it, it was a bit strange. Could this woman really be Wu You’er’s aunt?

Looking at it that way, this woman did seem a bit like Wu Tao.

“What's going on? This woman is Uncle Tian’s aunt?” Zhang Bao and Niu Meng looked at each other in confusion. Was it a family matter?

Seeing this scene, they didn’t dare to speak up and just watched anxiously.

This woman sighed and said: “It’s normal that you don’t know me. Whether from Lianxing’s family or You’er’s family, you can call me aunt.”

At this point, Su Nantian finally realized. It seemed this woman was also from the Wu family branch, but he didn’t know where she came from or if she had any connection with the Wu family of Jingdu.

“Are you really Lianxing and You’er’s aunt?” Su Nantian hesitated: “If you are really You’er’s aunt, why did you kidnap her parents?”

“What do you mean by ‘kidnapped’? That’s too harsh a word,” Bing Jie said with a bitter smile. “I won’t lie to you. They voluntarily went with us. They’ve already boarded the plane and are on their way to Jingdu.”

“What? Voluntarily? And they’ve already boarded the plane?” Su Nantian heard this and his face darkened. Boarding a plane was one thing, but going to Jingdu?

It seemed the situation with Wu Tao’s family wasn’t as simple as he had imagined.

“What's going on?” Su Nantian asked.

Bing Jie sighed and said earnestly to Su Nantian: “Kid, I don’t want to tell you the truth. Some things are not beneficial for you at your current level. You just need to know they’re safe.”

She said half of it and then dropped a bombshell: “I won’t lie to you. Wu Tao is actually the heir of the Wu family in Jingdu. He was originally a candidate for the next head of the Wu family.”

“What? Uncle Tian’s uncle is from the Wu family in Jingdu?” “My god, so does that mean Uncle Tian is also from the Wu family of Jingdu?” After hearing Bing Jie’s words, Zhang Bao and others nearby were shocked.

The name of the Wu family is known to everyone. It’s one of the top families in Jingdu.

Chapter 366: Mysterious and Confusing

Even in a place like Jingdu, the Wu family would make the surrounding areas tremble with just one step. This shows how powerful the Wu family is.

Although Su Nantian had been hanging around in Fengcheng for a long time, he knew the distribution of power within the country. As someone who understood the situation, he clearly knew how terrifying the Wu family was.

In the eyes of ordinary people, the Wu family’s power mainly came from business and politics. But Su Nantian knew the real reason for their terror was that they were an ancient martial arts family.

Not only in Jingdu, but any ancient martial arts family placed across the entire country would have a significant influence. Especially since the Wu family was among the top in ancient martial arts families!

“Uncle Tao is a candidate for the head of the Wu family in Jingdu?” Su Nantian found it hard to believe.

If Wu Tao really had such a background, why had he been bullied by those small hooligans? Where had the Wu family members gone for so long? Had they not seen their family suffer so much?

Or was it the same as with Shi’s side—Wu Tao hadn’t received recognition within the Wu family, so he had moved to a small place like Hangcheng?
