“Good heavens, who on earth is he…” At this point, Qi Yeyi could not help but admire after witnessing Su Nantian’s speed in the night, as he vanished like a flash, leaving no trace of his presence.

“I can only say our previous decision was correct. To be enemies with such a person, it was truly the result of a mind gone mad.” Qi Yinzhen also marveled. They both deeply felt that the Shadow Assassins Organization’s decision to submit to Su Nantian had been a rational choice.

“Everyone, pay attention. The target has vanished into the night. I have no idea where he went.” A member of the mercenary organization relayed information to one another. They had previously locked onto Su Nantian with precision, but in that single moment, he was gone.

“Received. All positions continue observation. There must be something fishy.”

They did not know that, while exchanging messages, Su Nantian had already reached the first sentry post.

Su Nantian walked directly behind the man and struck his neck with a hand blade. The man immediately collapsed, stunned by Su Nantian’s speed. He had no chance to react and was unaware that someone had silently appeared behind him.

Yet, before he fainted, his body’s instinctive reaction caused a low groan. This sound spread through the walkie-talkie to others’ ears.

“1st post, 1st post. Respond. What happened on your end? I feel something is wrong.”

Su Nantian smiled and took the walkie-talkie from the man, along with his firearm.

“Hello. I am the one you’ve been searching for—Su Nantian. Your 1st post has been eliminated. I will now approach each of you one by one and eliminate you all. You don’t need to search for me; I am coming to find you.”

Su Nantian laughed coldly and turned off the walkie-talkie. The other side only heard static.

“Full alert, full alert. The target is moving forward and has eliminated the 1st post. All positions must remain vigilant.” Upon hearing Su Nantian’s message, they immediately relayed orders.

It was undeniable that upon hearing Su Nantian’s voice on the walkie-talkie, their hearts had turned cold.

They all wore night vision goggles, scanning every inch of the surroundings. Yet, despite this, the 1st post had still been eliminated by Su Nantian without detection.

“Meanwhile, Su Nantian carried his firearms and stealthily moved toward the next hidden post.”

At this moment, the 2nd post’s guard was observing the surroundings. Yet he still failed to notice Su Nantian approaching.

“What’s wrong, little brother? Looking for someone?” Su Nantian said with a smile and placed one hand on the man’s shoulder, while the other held a dagger pressed against his neck.

“Drop your gun. If you don’t play tricks, I’ll spare your life.”

Su Nantian truly did not wish to harm him. However, the man nodded outwardly but secretly pulled a small knife from his pocket with his other hand, preparing to stab Su Nantian in reverse.

“Don’t play tricks,” Su Nantian said, but instead of stabbing his neck, he struck again. With his strength, the man would not awaken for two or three days.

Su Nantian then quickly picked up the walkie-talkie from the 2nd post and addressed the others: “The 2nd post has also been taken. You should surrender without resistance; otherwise, I cannot guarantee what I’ll do to you.”

The remaining two men were in panic. One immediately reported to the warehouse: “The target has infiltrated and eliminated two of us. Please be cautious.” “Ahh!”

Before the man finished speaking, he let out a scream. Su Nantian had already infiltrated behind him and struck with another hand blade, knocking him out.

“You’re the last one left. The 3rd post has also been taken.” Su Nantian pressed forward relentlessly, announcing each elimination immediately. Everyone could hear the process.

At this moment, Leng Zhi Fei in the warehouse had already heard the reports. He cursed: “Damn it, Su Nantian is too brazen! You all immediately send everyone out to kill him.”

Leng Zhi Fei said this to the mercenary leader beside him, but the man waved his hand.

“Why won’t you go out and kill him as I told you? I’ve given you so much money!” Leng Zhi Fei roared in anger, surprised that these mercenaries still did not obey him.

Chapter 412: Secrets Within

“You paid us, so naturally we’ll do as you wish. However, now is not the time to send people out; it would gain us nothing. The environment is night, and even those we previously stationed with night vision goggles were still eliminated by him. This proves his combat ability in the dark is formidable.”

The mercenary leader explained to Leng Zhi Fei step by step.

“So instead of sending people out, we should stay inside the warehouse and continue our setup. After all, he will eventually enter. If we rashly go out now, the night vision goggles won’t help. We might cause greater losses. Yes, you paid us, but I must also consider my men; I can’t just do one deal. These people I still need to keep.”

It was undeniable that this was a renowned international mercenary organization. They spoke with logic and reason, not groveling because Leng Zhi Fei was their employer.

After hearing this, Leng Zhi Fei could only nod. He also felt the man was right. He patted his shoulder and said, “John, this matter is now in your hands. Make sure to capture him for me.”

“Don’t worry, since we’ve taken your money, we’ll do as you asked. If we fail to meet your requirements, we won’t take a penny; that’s our integrity.” John said and waved his dagger with a sly grin.

“Hahahaha, I see how Su Nantian will escape this time. Let him die here today.” Leng Zhi Fei was almost mad, his eyes red.

Meanwhile, behind them, Wen Ran and Wu Youer were tied to a post with ropes and had cloth stuffed in their mouths. They both groaned but no one paid attention to them.

These people were accustomed to seeing kidnapped hostages. No matter what sounds they made, they ignored it.

At this moment outside the warehouse, Su Nantian had eliminated all sentries. He then immediately returned to where Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yeyi stood.

“Elder Brother, you’ve returned. How was it?” Qi Yeyi asked, unsure what Su Nantian had done because they stood there in complete silence.

“I’ve eliminated four sentries. They are all taken care of. There is no longer any presence outside the warehouse. I guess they must have set up ambushes inside. Also, these people have already sent the message in, so Leng Zhi Fei must have deployed them inside.”

Su Nantian carefully analyzed the current situation. However, upon hearing this, Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yeyi both stared in disbelief.

“Elder Brother, what did you say? You said you eliminated their hidden sentries?” Qi Yeyi was shocked, unable to believe it. After all, they had stood there without hearing any sound. If there was a fight or gunfire, the sounds would have been loud.

Su Nantian nodded with an innocent expression. “Yes, I’ve eliminated all their sentries.”

As he said this, Su Nantian took out the few guns he had acquired and waved them before their eyes. At this moment, Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yeyi could finally confirm that Su Nantian had not been boasting.

He truly had knocked them out, and it was done without detection.

Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yeyi exchanged glances again, their eyes filled with shock. They once more felt that their initial decision had been extremely wise.

“You two each take one. The remaining two should be assigned to those with better combat skills. Once we enter the warehouse, Leng Zhi Fei will definitely have ambushes set up inside. However, you don’t need to fear; I’ll go first and draw the attack. You shouldn’t rush in blindly, wait for my signal. Once I’ve lured them all out, you can then sweep the entrance with gunfire.”

Su Nantian outlined his plan. This plan was crude and simple but highly effective. However, it would be impossible to execute without Su Nantian.

Because the key to this plan was Su Nantian going first. Only if the front person remained unharmed could they lure everyone out, allowing those behind to proceed smoothly.

“You must follow my instructions. Don’t rush in blindly, even if I die inside, don’t enter until I give you the signal.” Su Nantian earnestly issued his orders.

“Elder Brother, don’t worry. We’ll follow your commands.” Qi Yinzhen immediately said seriously.

“Then you two now follow me. Remember what I just said.” Thus, Su Nantian led the four members of the Shadow Assassins Organization toward the warehouse.

Who could have imagined that they faced an international mercenary organization with only five people, and their weapons were even those Su Nantian had just obtained.

After reaching the warehouse door, Su Nantian made a gesture to the remaining four people, signaling them to split into pairs and hide beside him, waiting for his signal.

After confirming that Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yeyi had hidden properly, he knocked on the warehouse door and shouted without hesitation: “Leng Zhi Fei, I’m here. I am Su Nantian. Hurry up and release Wen Ran and Wu Youer; maybe I’ll spare your life. Don’t think you’ve found an international mercenary organization and are so arrogant. In my eyes, you’re nothing but dirt!”

This was Su Nantian’s usual tone. Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yeyi were very familiar with it. The Shadow Assassins Organization had previously been troubled by Su Nantian’s trash talk.

In fact, Su Nantian was intentionally trying to provoke Leng Zhi Fei at this moment. This way, once Su Nantian entered, the people they had hidden would immediately attack him.

Su Nantian’s guess was correct. Upon hearing Su Nantian’s shout, Leng Zhi Fei had already become furious and trembled.

“Make sure to kill Su Nantian! Absolutely!” Leng Zhi Fei restrained his urge and said to John.

“You can rest assured. We’ll definitely deal with this kid. I never expected him to be so arrogant and destroy my four brothers.”

John truly believed Su Nantian had killed his men, but in reality, Su Nantian had only knocked them out with a hand blade.

Chapter 413: Total Annihilation

“You just follow the plan we discussed. I’ll go and set up first.” John made a gesture and walked toward Wen Ran and Wu Youer, hiding behind a cardboard box.

When he approached the box and hid himself, he immediately whistled to Leng Zhi Fei.

Leng Zhi Fei heard this and smiled, then shouted loudly at the door: “Su Nantian, come in! Come see your two women!”

Leng Zhi Fei said this while walking toward Wen Ran.

Su Nantian pushed the door open with a bang. The warehouse had already been set up by the international mercenary organization, but on the surface, it seemed only Leng Zhi Fei and the kidnapped Wen Ran and Wu Youer were present.

Su Nantian laughed coldly. He had already uncovered the hidden people, although they thought their ambush was隐蔽 (hidden), but in reality, they were still humans hiding there. Su Nantian could sense their presence with a slight perception and had already located the positions of over thirty people in the warehouse.

“Leng Zhi Fei, you’re bold. How dare you be alone here?” Su Nantian saw Wen Ran and Wu Youer tied to the post, his anger restrained. He made a casual tease.

“I came to wait for you to die.” Leng Zhi Fei smiled and grabbed Wen Ran’s chin.

“What are you doing? Let go of her. Don’t touch her, or I’ll make you regret it.” He said with clenched teeth, surprised that Leng Zhi Fei was flirting with Wen Ran in front of him. This was clearly meant to provoke him.

“Why? Isn’t it wrong for me to touch my fiancée? Su Nantian, don’t forget, it was you who stole my fiancée at the wedding. Now how has she become your woman?” Leng Zhi Fei said this and then touched Wu Youer’s face.

At this moment, Wen Ran and Wu Youer both groaned. They wanted to tell Su Nantian there were ambushes, but they could not make themselves understood. They thought it was their cries after being flirted with by Leng Zhi Fei.

“Don’t make me say it again. Take your dirty hands off her, or I’ll cut them off.不信 you try.” Su Nantian said fiercely and warned.

“Oh, really? Then I’ll definitely touch her.” Leng Zhi Fei put his hand on her again, even pinching Wu Youer’s face twice.

Wu Youer’s face turned red where he pinched it, making her look even more pitiful.

“Ah!” As soon as this happened, Su Nantian shot a small dagger at Leng Zhi Fei’s hand. It hit directly in the center of his palm, piercing through it.

“Su Nantian, you!” Leng Zhi Fei shouted but didn’t expect that Leng Zhi Fei immediately pulled the dagger out of his hand.

“You’ve done this to me, so I’ll have to go after your women.” Leng Zhi Fei said and took the dagger, attempting to slash it across Wen Ran’s face.

“Take your life!” Su Nantian shouted and rushed toward Leng Zhi Fei.

But at this moment, Leng Zhi Fei was calm and unafraid, even smiling. Because it was his plan.

Although it deviated slightly from Leng Zhi Fei’s initial plan of provoking Su Nantian with words, at least now Su Nantian had entered the warehouse and was completely surrounded by the international mercenary organization.

“Attack!” Leng Zhi Fei ordered, and the hidden mercenaries immediately emerged from their hiding spots. They started shooting at Su Nantian’s position.

Wen Ran and Wu Youer both groaned and cried, but they knew they could do nothing. They were aware of Leng Zhi Fei’s plan, but they couldn’t tell Su Nantian. They could only watch as Su Nantian was attacked by these people.

And with such a dense gunfire, if Su Nantian survived, it would be a miracle.

Just as the gunshots echoed, a sharp whistle suddenly rang out. This sound made Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yeyi, who were listening outside the warehouse with trepidation, finally feel at ease. This whistle was Su Nantian’s prearranged signal.

Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yeyi immediately rushed to the warehouse door with the remaining two Shadow Assassins members. They followed Su Nantian’s instructions and shot into the warehouse without looking.

Initially, Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yeyi had worried about accidentally injuring themselves if they shot as Su Nantian instructed. But after the initial gunfire, they clearly confirmed that Su Nantian could ensure their safety.

The international mercenaries who had been set up behind them were completely unprepared. They hadn’t expected that people would suddenly attack from the warehouse door, and with them already hunting Su Nantian, they thought these shots were from their own people.

Quickly, all the mercenaries who had been hidden were shot and fell to the ground.

At this moment, Su Nantian hid in the shadows and whistled again. Upon hearing this, Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yeyi knew it was Su Nantian’s signal to retreat. Thus, the four of them immediately withdrew without hesitation.

Although Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yeyi were puzzled about how Su Nantian had survived such a dense gunfire, they knew he had indeed done it and could do so.

“Impossible! Impossible! John, come out!” Leng Zhi Fei roared. Before his eyes were all the international mercenaries who had fallen, while Su Nantian now smiled and walked out from behind a container.

John, who had been hiding behind Wen Ran and Wu Youer, was not injured. He looked at the scene in disbelief.

He knew he had met a steel wall, but for the huge payment, he had to push forward.

John suddenly emerged from the cardboard box at his door.

“Hey, you finally came out. You’ve been hiding for so long. Now your brothers are all gone; it’s just you left.” Su Nantian said calmly, looking at those who had fallen.

Although not all the mercenaries were dead and some still groaned on the ground, they had all been shot.

Chapter 414: Rescue

“Who are you?” John was shocked. He even doubted Su Nantian’s identity was far more complicated than he knew.

Because Leng Zhi Fei had told John that this mission was against a thug who had climbed to power through some means and had a group of followers. But John now judged that Su Nantian was definitely not an ordinary person. He could not be just a thug. Such combat skills and strategy were beyond the reach of ordinary people.

“I am who you are targeting—Su Nantian.” Su Nantian said with a smile and stared at John.

“I didn’t ask for your name. I asked about your background. Who are you? You’re definitely not as simple as they said.” John continued.

“I don’t care about my background. What matters now is that you’ve kidnapped my people, and I’m here to get them back. If you help me subdue Leng Zhi Fei and release my two people, I’ll pretend this never happened. It’s unrelated to you; after all, I’ve injured so many of your men.” Su Nantian raised an eyebrow and offered John a chance.

But Su Nantian also knew that people like John from the mercenary organization would never be swayed by him. They were different from Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yeyi; they wouldn’t submit to him.

So Su Nantian had never intended to target John from the start. He just used this as a condition for exchange, making himself less likely to fight later.

Leng Zhi Fei was desperate and immediately said to John: “I’ve paid you, so if you can capture Su Nantian for me, I’ll add five million more to your payment.”

“Leng Zhi Fei, you’ve really invested a lot to capture me. You can afford such a high price of twenty-five million. I just want to ask you, where did you get this money from?”

Su Nantian turned and smiled at John: “Also, you’re not being sincere in business. Didn’t you check if he has this much money? His entire Tihao Group is in my hands. Where would the money come from to pay you?”

Upon hearing this, John turned his head and asked Leng Zhi Fei: “Is what he said true? Do you really have money?”

Leng Zhi Fei, although his heart was pounding, maintained a facade of strength. “Of course I do. I’ve already paid you the deposit, haven’t I? How could I get the deposit without money? Don’t listen to him trying to stir up our relationship. If you let go now, you’ll get nothing.”

“Unfortunately, your words don’t work on me. Even if he really has no money, once I kill him and let him regain control of the Tihao Group, he’ll have money to pay me. Moreover, my brothers were injured so many times; if I let you go now, I’d be a fool.”

As he said this, John raised his gun but realized he had already been targeted by Su Nantian without notice.

“Come on, I want to see if your gun is faster or mine. I’m confident I can dodge your bullets, but are you confident?” Su Nantian remained calm even though he was being shot at.

“Let’s both put our guns down. Then we fight with bare hands. If I win, I’ll take the people away. If I lose, I’ll let you deal with me however you like.”

John laughed heartily and said: “You’re coming to your own doom. I’m most skilled in hand-to-hand combat. These gunplay things aren’t my strength. If that’s the case, let’s fight a match. Let the bet decide.”

After saying this, John immediately threw his gun to the ground and walked toward the center of the warehouse. He waved at Su Nantian.

Su Nantian immediately threw his gun aside and walked to the center. John immediately attacked Su Nantian, but all his punches missed. Su Nantian only evaded and never retaliated, which made John feel very bad.

He immediately sensed the feeling of being crushed. The opponent didn’t even need to strike, yet he had perfectly evaded his attacks. And the opponent still seemed to have remaining strength, which proved his own strength was far below Su Nantian’s.

“Enough. I don’t have time to play with you.” After saying this, Su Nantian struck John in the stomach. John could see the fist coming toward his abdomen.

He immediately tried to dodge, but this punch still hit him directly in the stomach.

“This…” John didn’t even finish his sentence before he fell to the ground, spitting blood and passing out.

At this moment, Leng Zhi Fei had already picked up the gun he dropped and walked toward Wen Ran and Wu Youer, then shouted wildly.

“Su Nantian, I’ll have your two women to die with me!” After saying this, Leng Zhi Fei pulled the trigger and shot at Wen Ran’s head.

Wen Ran felt her life was about to end at this moment, but when she closed her eyes, there was no pain and no gunshot sound.

When Wen Ran opened her eyes again, she found Leng Zhi Fei had fallen straight to the ground, his hands covered in blood.

“Sorry I was late. I made you scared. Now I’ll untie you. Just bear it a little.” Su Nantian said and immediately used a small knife to cut the ropes binding Wen Ran and Wu Youer.

At this moment, Su Nantian realized that because Wu Youer had seen Leng Zhi Fei about to kill Wen Ran, she was so desperate that she fainted.

So Wen Ran didn’t even care about her own fear and immediately said to Su Nantian: “Nantian, first save Wu Youer!”

“Can you walk? If so, I’ll hold your hand.”

Seeing Wen Ran nodded, Su Nantian took one hand to hold Wen Ran and the other arm to carry Wu Youer out of the warehouse.

At this moment, Leng Zhi Fei’s tendons and ligaments had all been severed by Su Nantian. However, Su Nantian did not intend to take Leng Zhi Fei back because he had already promised Cold Boxiong to spare his life. So the remaining matters would be for him to handle.

“Qi Yinzhen, immediately drive to the hospital. Qi Yeyi, you call Cold Boxiong and tell him I’ve kept my promise. I didn’t take his son’s life. Now Long Zhi Fei is lying in the warehouse outside, let him come and get them himself.” Su Nantian issued his orders.

Chapter 415: Awakening

Su Nantian immediately took Wen Ran and Wu Youer to the hospital.

Originally, only Wu Youer had fainted. But under Su Nantian’s insistence, Wen Ran was also forced to undergo a full checkup.

Fortunately, the results showed both were fine. Wu Youer had fainted due to shock after seeing Su Nantian being shot at, while Wen Ran was healthy. However, both had not eaten for half a day and were weak.

“Just shocked. They’ll wake up after resting. You can either stay in a VIP room here or take them home.” The doctor said to Su Nantian after examining Wu Youer.

Su Nantian nodded. “Then let’s have a VIP room. It’s more convenient here; if anything happens, we can call the doctor immediately.”

This was a private hospital. It wasn’t as crowded as public hospitals, so they welcomed guests who requested VIP rooms.

In short, money could move even ghosts. Su Nantian paid a large sum and immediately arranged for Wu Youer to have a room.

Moreover, Su Nantian was stubborn in making Wen Ran rest in the hospital. Even though Wen Ran said she wasn’t tired, Su Nantian still made her lie down.

“Su Nantian, I really can’t sleep.” Wen Ran sighed at him, knowing Su Nantian was concerned for her. But making her sleep was impossible.

“Then lie down and rest, we can chat too. This place is safe; Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yeyi are guarding outside.”

Actually, Su Nantian didn’t want Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yeyi or the Shadow Assassins to guard them outside, but he couldn’t resist their insistence because they said they wanted to protect the three of them.

“Today was really a hardship for you. I never expected Leng Zhi Fei to dare kidnap you and Wu Youer. I wanted to dismember him, but I had promised Cold Boxiong to spare his life. So I could only do this.”

Su Nantian said while gently stroking Wen Ran’s hair, his eyes full of compassion.

Wen Ran shook her head and said: “I’m fine. But I was really scared, thinking something had happened to you. So many guns aimed at you—it was terrifying.”

“It’s nothing for me, don’t worry.” Su Nantian comforted.

Just as they were talking, Wu Youer made a sound. Su Nantian and Wen Ran immediately looked over and saw Wu Youer翻身 (turned over) and opened her eyes.

“Wu Youer, you’re awake. Do you feel any discomfort? I’ll call the doctor.” Su Nantian immediately asked, then pressed the button to call the doctor.

The private hospital’s service was indeed thorough. Su Nantian pressed the button not long after, and the doctor arrived with several nurses.

“Doctor, she’s awake. Check if there’s anything wrong.” Su Nantian pointed to Wu Youer.

The doctor nodded and immediately led the nurses to examine Wu Youer. After a thorough check, he told Su Nantian: “This lady is fine now and her body is healthy. However, she’s slightly dehydrated; it seems she hasn’t eaten for half a day. You can either go home or get some intravenous fluids here.”

Su Nantian had originally wanted to give both Wen Ran and Wu Youer intravenous fluids. This way, he could feel at ease. However, the two strongly opposed it.

Su Nantian couldn’t resist their insistence and only took them home.

Wu Youer, due to the shock today and her previous fainting, was still weak. After returning home, she immediately fell asleep.

Wen Ran, however, remained energetic. So Su Nantian stayed with her and they talked in bed.

“Today really scared me; I wish I could have...” Su Nantian said this, but Wen Ran covered his mouth.

“Don’t mention today’s events again. Let it be as if it never happened. Besides, you’ve already punished Leng Zhi Fei. Moreover, now the Tihao Group is yours.”

“Okay, we won’t talk about these depressing things. You were also scared today; tomorrow don’t go to the Tihao Group, rest at home for two days. As for company operations, I’ll have them handle it.” Su Nantian suggested Wen Ran rest at home.

“Unfortunately, I can’t. The Tihao Group is facing a big problem now.” Wen Ran said seriously, indicating the issue was significant.

Although Su Nantian heard about problems in the Tihao Group, he seemed indifferent.

“Problems? What kind of problems? I think the Tihao Group was already in ruins. That’s why it had losses before, and no one knew about it. You don’t need to be so concerned about work; the Tihao Group’s problems require a major overhaul. You can take your time.”

In short, Su Nantian was reluctant to let Wen Ran work so hard. Although he had handed over the Tihao Group to her and made her a president, he didn’t think she should work so hard.

Wen Ran pouted and said: “That’s not possible. This issue can’t be delayed. I found that some high-ranking officials are transferring assets because they saw the Tihao Group changed leadership. I just don’t have evidence yet; if I do, I’ll deal with them immediately.”

Su Nantian saw Wen Ran’s serious expression and couldn’t help but laugh.

“What are you laughing at?” Wen Ran looked at Su Nantian, who was just teasing her. She pretended to be angry and punched Su Nantian lightly.

“Oops, I’m sorry. I didn’t laugh at you; I just think you’re cute. Of course, this issue must be resolved. But what’s the situation? Tell me so I can help.”

Su Nantian felt this matter might need his involvement. If it was indeed the high-ranking officials of the Tihao Group trying to transfer assets during this personnel change, Su Nantian would definitely not allow it.

In short, the Tihao Group was won by Su Nantian in a bet. But now it was truly his property, and he would not allow anyone to take anything from him.

Wen Ran thought it was better for Su Nantian to get involved. After all, she was just the president; the Tihao Group’s shares were still Su Nantian’s.

“Wait until tomorrow to list the names of a few people. These three are the most suspicious, but they’re on the opposite side now, so investigating them shouldn’t be too difficult. I just hadn’t started yet when Leng Zhi Fei took me.”

Chapter 416: Setting a Trap

After a night of rest, Wen Ran ignored Su Nantian’s opposition and went to the Tihao Group the next day. In her eyes, the Tihao Group was facing a major crisis.

Wu Youer had also recovered after resting. Su Nantian told her to rest at home for a few days, but as a young person, she recovered quickly and went back to school.

So Su Nantian also followed Wen Ran to the Tihao Group. Today he came to see who was trying to transfer assets.

Su Nantian followed Wen Ran into her president’s office and immediately opened a file on the computer. It contained information about three people.

Wen Ran pointed to the screen and said: “It’s one of these three. I still can’t determine who it is. I originally wanted to set a trap, but Leng Zhi Fei disrupted my plan.”

She looked quite frustrated.

Su Nantian looked at the information on the screen. These three people were indeed important positions in the Tihao Group.

One was previously accused of being the financial director, but Su Nantian had clear evidence that the previous losses weren’t his doing. So he hadn’t punished him, and he still held his position.

The other two were responsible for business coordination and internal personnel changes.

These three people had important positions and held real power, so they each had their own fixed factions within the Tihao Group.

After reviewing this, Su Nantian gave his opinion: “These three people are of high status in the Tihao Group. Because of this, their relationships should be poor and mutually suspicious. I think we can take advantage of this to make them fight each other. I suggest setting a trap and seeing who among them has the intention.”

“Your words are easy, but how exactly do we set this trap?” Wen Ran frowned and looked puzzled. He knew he needed to find a way to lure out these three people, but what was the method?

Su Nantian thought for a moment and smiled at Wen Ran: “Want to go play in the neighboring island city?”

Wen Ran saw Su Nantian’s sly smile and knew he had another plan.
