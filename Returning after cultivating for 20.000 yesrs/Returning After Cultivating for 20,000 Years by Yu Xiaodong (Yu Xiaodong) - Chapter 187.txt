“Child, what is your name?” He Wei asked cautiously, hoping for the answer in his heart. If it was indeed as he suspected, this would be a great gain; bringing the child back, the master might reward him greatly.

His status within the organization would further elevate; even becoming number two was no problem. The more he thought about it, the more excited his mood became.

But the child did not answer, as if he had discovered something!

Silence. Stillness.

He Wei was instantly stunned. Had he exposed some flaw that the child had noticed? No, he thought his performance earlier was quite satisfactory. The Oscar-winning actor's disdain—perhaps his excitement had gotten the better of him.

“Child, I'm not a bad person. I really want to help you. Believe me, these wounds were caused by a big tiger. Today I came here, it's fate that we met. Take this.” He Wei's hands searched his body.

After searching for a while, he finally found something—a trinket he had seen on the way here, a mask. A white-faced mask with a smiling expression, appearing very festive and adorable.

“Tell me your name, and I'll give you this mask. It will bring blessings, comfort your deceased relatives, and protect them in the afterlife.” He Wei was already spouting nonsense, himself not believing a word. He hoped this trick would work on the child.

He Wei held up the mask for a long time, finally about to force the answer when the child's hand reached out, taking the mask and examining it thoroughly.

He Wei saw the child’s expression and knew he liked it. He was about to get the answer he desired, his breath tightening.

“Now can you tell me your name?” He Wei smiled, afraid of showing a fierce expression and scaring the child.

“I'm Xiao Wang!” The child said his real name, trying the mask on his face and playing joyfully.

Ha! Ha! Ha!

He Wei burst into laughter, excitement barely concealed. His face even smiled grotesquely. This was truly her good fortune; obtaining the target effortlessly. Now he thought he should thank that tiger, who had probably already engaged Su Nantian's forces.

Xiao Wang looked at the man suddenly changing his demeanor, saying fearfully: “Uncle, what's wrong with you? Your face is so terrifying.”

“Ha! I'm happy. I'm glad to see you.” He grabbed Xiao Wang's shoulder with one hand and lifted him up with the other.

Feeling the immense strength on his shoulder, Xiao Wang immediately realized something was wrong. This was a bad person, likely sent to capture them. His feet and arms struggled constantly, tossing the mask onto the ground. But no matter how he struggled, it was all in vain.

“You wanted to know why? I'll tell you. We are the ones who killed your family, those searching for you. Your relatives and friends are all dead fish. Our hands.” He Wei's voice trembled with excitement, this feeling was too exquisite—more so than killing him himself.

Chapter 934: Success

“You deserve it. Why? Why?” Xiao Wang struggled fiercely, his eyes turning red with hatred, wishing to die with the man before him. But he couldn't; he could only be at their mercy.

“Ha! Surprised? Happy? Do you want to kill me now? Don't worry, soon you'll be reunited with them. You won't be alone in this world. Your uncle will also go down to join you. Ha! Ha!” He Wei held Xiao Wang under his armpit, as if holding his future money, women, and supreme power. He was entranced by it all.

If he could please the master, he couldn't imagine what treasures he might gain. The thought made him long to take the child back immediately, presenting him to the master—perhaps earning a mysterious gift.

He Wei carried Xiao Wang under his armpit and rushed away, eager to return as fast as possible. Never had he felt such urgency.

Meanwhile, Su Nantian approached the group who had formed a circle. He no longer hid in the shadows but directly stepped before them.

When the mysterious item was unveiled, it turned out to be a person, not some ghostly or enigmatic thing. Their courage grew; one man against many—could they not defeat him?

Even a single stick could kill him.

But A Dai felt deeper danger upon seeing Su Nantian. He was certain this man would kill them effortlessly, but could they just give up?

A Dai's mind raced. As his life was about to end, his potential was awakened.

He thought of many methods but dismissed them all. In the face of absolute martial power, they had no chance.

As he struggled to find a solution, someone in the crowd shouted. The group became restless, rushing toward Su Nantian like wild horses, chaotic and senseless—unaware it was suicide.

Su Nantian smiled coldly. They came to kill him; he would return their tactics against them—was it not fair?

Let their blood sacrifice the souls of Xiaoyu Village. May they be comforted, knowing companionship would not leave them lonely. Otherwise, who would chat with them?

Su Nantian rushed into the crowd but no blade touched his clothes. He moved effortlessly among them.

After passing through the first wave of attacks, he stood still. Each person fell motionless in seconds, then collapsed with a crash.

The remaining few stared wide-eyed with fear. They had never seen anyone so powerful—like a demon from hell wielding an awesome scythe.

They were powerless, fear spreading through them. Not even a chance to fight back; weapons clattered to the ground.

Some fainted from fear, others fell to their knees with vacant eyes. Some even ran toward a tree and crashed into it rather than face this demon.

Though some tried to resist, after taking two steps they collapsed motionless. Su Nantian stepped forward one by one until only A Dai remained standing.

Su Nantian was somewhat curious about this man, as he saw no fear in his eyes. Death seemed harmless to him. In fact, there was an emotion he shouldn't have—discontent.

Before Su Nantian could ask further, a bad premonition struck him. He looked toward the distant horizon and felt an awful sense—half a chance he could confirm Xiao Wang was in trouble.

No time to think, he grabbed A Dai and rushed away. Su Nantian's steps were swift, moving at incredible speed.

At that moment, A Dai finally understood why he couldn't see Su Nantian's figure earlier—his speed was too fast, making it hard to breathe. A Dai covered his mouth and nose, barely catching a breath.

This was astonishing; no one would believe it. They had never been his opponents, no matter how many came.

In no time, Su Nantian returned to the village head's courtyard. The door was open. Su Nantian's heart skipped a beat as he scanned the room, finding a mask on the ground. After searching thoroughly, he found no sign of Xiao Wang.

Su Nantian knew Xiao Wang was missing. The mask's presence indicated he had been taken.

He turned to A Dai, “Who else? What was your plan?”

A Dai was also stunned. “Who else?”

He looked at the mask in Su Nantian's hand, frowning and recalling. Soon he remembered something, “There was our leader; we got separated later. I haven't seen him since. This mask he bought in town—probably he took your friend.”

Xiao Wang forced himself to stay calm, hope reigniting in his heart. If he could assist this man to save his friend, maybe they could survive.

He quickly added, “I can lead you to our headquarters and save your friend.”

Su Nantian glanced at the mask, nodded. He wasn't worried about this kid tricking him; even if he didn’t guide the way, he could find the person. The mask carried a heavy scent; though the trail would grow stronger, the general direction wouldn’t be off.

Su Nantian said nothing more, only two words: “Lead the way.”

A Dai felt every word from this man was like a knife at his neck. The air around him turned cold. He had no choice but to place his hope in this man.

A Dai checked the direction, pointing toward a forest. “From here, though the path is rugged, it shortens the distance. Maybe we can intercept them before they return to headquarters.”

Since they had kidnapped your friend, there was no immediate danger.

Su Nantian didn’t say more, lifting A Dai and rushing in that direction.

Chapter 935: Pursuit

Due to the sudden burst of speed, A Dai struggled as if suffocating. Su Nantian frowned and slightly slowed down. After about half an hour of running, Su Nantian suddenly stopped.

He noticed the scent on the mask had disappeared. This was a vast wasteland, but ground traces suggested a vehicle had stopped here. A Dai felt embarrassed and glanced at Su Nantian.

But he quickly said, “Our headquarters is deep in the mountains. This kind of vehicle can't enter. Compared to your speed, we can still catch up.”

Su Nantian frowned. He knew his speed was very fast but couldn't maintain it for long. His stamina was limited to about half an hour.

He wasn’t a god, after all. Even gods get tired. This meant taking the shortest route—taking back roads. The speed would definitely drop.

“How far is it in kilometers from here to your headquarters?” Su Nantian thought for a moment before speaking.

“We walked about five days. If calculated by the straight-line distance, it's approximately 500 kilometers.” A Dai felt embarrassed at this distance.

“Your headquarters is built so far away, in the depths of the mountains?” Su Nantian was speechless at A Dai's words. This distance far exceeded his expectations.

“Not extremely backward, the infrastructure is quite complete. Also, there's a mysterious power there. Some people can fly twenty or thirty meters off the ground. I've even seen some with speed comparable to yours. However, these people are wild tribesmen; they won't bother us unless provoked.” A Dai recalled.

“Oh, how many people are like this?” Su Nantian showed interest. He hadn’t expected such people to exist. He had a guess—these people might know his identity.

“First, draw me a rough map. We'll talk more on the way.” Su Nantian said calmly, his tone very gentle.

“Okay!” A Dai readily agreed. He didn’t feel commanded but gradually admired Su Nantian. He deeply desired to gain that power.

Then he could kill the Demon Sect’s people and avenge his sister and parents. But there was no way they would teach him.

A Dai quickly sketched a rough map on the paper. Three major mountains were marked along the way, even a large river. The mountain path was extremely rugged. When he finished drawing and handed it to Su Nantian, he felt a bit embarrassed.

Su Nantian nodded slightly, observing the map. He hadn’t expected this man to be familiar with geography. The three mountains and some road signs were clearly marked, as if he had walked this path before.

“This path you've taken before,” Su Nantian said directly, not asking but stating a fact.

A Dai was shocked. He felt fear again. This man had judged he had taken this path just by looking at a map. It was terrifying. His sharp insight, though he had tried to hide it.

Seeing A Dai's reaction, Su Nantian knew he definitely had. Thus, the map was likely genuine. This kid's background must be complicated.

“Let’s go.” Su Nantian tossed the map to A Dai and headed in another direction.

After taking two steps, A Dai realized the direction was wrong. The map showed the destination in the opposite direction. This guy must not know how to read a map, he immediately reminded him, “You seem to have taken the wrong direction.”

“Oh, you lead the way.” Su Nantian said without a hint of embarrassment.

After Su Nantian said to lead the way, A Dai stood there motionless, hesitating to speak.

“Speak up. Don’t hide it. Even if you say you want to kill me, it’s fine.” Su Nantian spoke calmly, devoid of any emotion.

“We need to prepare some food for the journey. The path is too long.” A Dai felt embarrassed, how could he survive walking all that way?

“Hunger. Since the journey is so long, bringing food—what’s the use? It will be eaten eventually. There are countless wild animals in the mountains; why bring dry food? Dry food is so tasteless.” Su Nantian was confused. How could anyone starve in the mountains?

“Okay.” A Dai thought about Su Nantian’s martial strength and said nothing more. Indeed, such a master could easily catch prey.

A Dai ran ahead while Su Nantian walked slowly behind. Though his movements were minimal, he wasn’t left behind. A Dai found it amazing but didn’t ask anything.

He ran until nightfall, exhausted and panting heavily.

Su Nantian placed one hand on his back. A Dai felt a warm current flow into his lungs, instantly relieving the chest tightness. He was shocked.

After calming down, A Dai’s eyes were filled with admiration and reverence for Su Nantian.

“No need to look at me like that. You can’t learn this. Also, I have no reason to teach you.” Su Nantian said calmly. He knew from the look in A Dai’s eyes.

“No, I don’t dare to hope you’ll teach me. As long as you don’t kill me, I’ll be grateful. I must survive.” A Dai said firmly.

“Rest first. I'll get some food.” Su Nantian left a sentence and vanished from the spot.

After Su Nantian left, A Dai broke out in cold sweat. Just now he felt a life-threatening crisis. If this man thought he was curious about the mysterious technique, he might kill him. Fortunately, he hadn’t had a single thought.

Soon, animal cries echoed through the forest. Hearing this sound, A Dai was stunned. It sounded like a bear’s call. Shortly after, a figure rushed out of the forest. To A Dai's surprise, it was Su Nantian holding two rabbits, struggling.

Like himself before, no matter how he struggled, it was futile. He could only wait for death.

“Was that a bear’s call?” A Dai asked cautiously.

“Light the fire. Roast the meat!” Su Nantian said only four words and didn’t answer his question.

Chapter 936: Transmission of Skills

Su Nantian directly threw a bundle of dry wood to the ground. With one hand, he made it burst into flames like magic.

Su Nantian didn’t find it strange at all. A Dai’s eyes were wide open, watching Su Nantian. This technique was like magic. He had never seen it before—no matches, no lighter—just one hand waved.

This was too amazing. It completely overturned A Dai’s worldview. His hands trembled as he took the rabbits from Su Nantian, then killed and cleaned them by the river. He skewered them with two sticks and placed them over the fire, roasting slowly.

A Dai occasionally looked at Su Nantian, his eyes filled with reverence and admiration. This scene was more shocking than the hand on his back.

Could it be that everything he saw was a lie? This guy was a magician. Impossible for such speed and content. How could a magician have this? Had they all been deceived?

This was too powerful.

A Dai didn’t dare to hope. Looking at the roasted rabbits on the fire, maybe one day he would become like this rabbit—able to satisfy his appetite. But he might only end up as a corpse in the wilderness, possibly devoured by wild animals.

“Focus. The rabbit is getting burnt.” Su Nantian, meditating with his eyes closed, said.

“Sorry.” A Dai was startled by Su Nantian’s words. He hurriedly flipped the meat and continued roasting.

Soon, a fragrant aroma spread out. A Dai’s stomach had been growling for a long time.

A Dai delivered the first roasted rabbit to Su Nantian. After taking it, he quickly devoured the whole thing. A Dai was stunned.

“Eat up. I’ll teach you something.” Su Nantian said calmly. Considering this kid’s speed, it would take many days to reach the destination. He couldn’t keep him around forever.

“Thank you, Master.” A Dai immediately knelt and bowed repeatedly. He felt the roasted rabbit was no longer tasty.

“I’m not your master, nor did I agree to take you as my disciple.” Su Nantian hadn’t expected this kid’s reaction. He had immediately knelt.

Although Su Nantian said that, A Dai didn’t stop his actions. He continued bowing for three times before slowly standing up and quickly finishing the rabbit.

Then he looked at Su Nantian with longing eyes, like a child wanting candy. No impurities.

“Cross-legged and close your eyes.”

A Dai immediately obeyed. Hearing Su Nantian’s voice felt like a divine call, he believed without doubt and was very sincere.

A series of obscure and difficult words came from Su Nantian’s mouth. Although A Dai didn’t understand, he tried to remember. Gradually, he felt some substances around him that he had never experienced before. Red firelight gathered more and more around him.

It slowly entered his body, gathering in his meridians. It was very comfortable and warm.

Su Nantian was quite surprised at this scene. Although the energy absorption technique he taught A Dai was definitely of high quality, he hadn’t expected this kid to succeed on the first try. Moreover, it was fire attribute.

Su Nantian was amazed at A Dai’s talent. He placed his hand again on A Dai's back, slowly guiding the energy in A Dai’s body to circulate.

One circuit. Two circuits. Three circuits.

After about half an hour, Su Nantian stopped. A Dai could now circulate the energy along the path he had just learned.

Although this kid looked a bit slow, his mind wasn’t dull. His talent was good.

“Continue to circulate the energy along this path for three hours, then we’ll depart.” Su Nantian said calmly.

After three hours, A Dai stopped circulating the energy. He felt his whole body filled with inexhaustible strength. His mind was unprecedentedly clear, and he felt like he had been reborn.

Before he could thank Su Nantian again, this time Su Nantian didn’t stop him. After A Dai bowed in gratitude, Su Nantian said slowly, “I’ll teach you another step method. Watch carefully; I’ll demonstrate it only once.”

A Dai hadn’t even finished being happy when he heard the second part. His hair stood on end. He immediately flipped through the small booklet. The cover had no words. When he opened the first page, he saw three big characters.

Cloud Shadow Step

The following pages were each a person’s figure with some words above. A Dai looked for a while but couldn’t see the way.

He imitated the steps on his feet according to the book’s posture, circulating the little energy he had.

One time. Two times. Three times. Soon A Dai’s energy was exhausted, his whole body became weak and powerless.

“Cross-legged, absorb the energy.”

After hearing the command, A Dai sat down immediately. He clearly felt this time absorbing energy was much smoother. The red fire points entered his body faster, and within half an hour he had achieved half the effect from before. A Dai was delighted.

Gradually, his whole body and mind sank into it.

After a while, A Dai felt the sound of endless wind in his ears. When he opened his eyes, he saw his body floating mid-air, the surrounding scenery rapidly receding.

Actually, after he practiced last night, Su Nantian was also amazed that this kid had such luck. He had entered a mysterious state on his second practice.

Xiao Wang’s fate was unknown, and he couldn’t just wait. He had to take this burden with him while rushing forward, even if the speed was slow, it was better than standing still.

Seeing A Dai wake up, Su Nantian slowly slowed down and finally stopped. “Travel.”

After letting go of A Dai, Su Nantian felt much lighter and could travel without so much effort. “Follow my steps, travel.”

Su Nantian intentionally slowed his pace. A Dai struggled to catch up behind him.

A Dai felt the energy in his body was full and was happy. He struggled to catch up with Su Nantian’s steps but couldn’t. However, he didn’t拉开 too much distance, which surprised him. Today he could even see Su Nantian’s steps clearly.

A Dai followed behind Su Nantian, watching and learning while imitating his steps. Without realizing it, they had reached the first mountain.

Chapter 937: Crossing the Iron Chain

Su Nantian looked at the towering mountain before him. Going over and under it was a waste of time. With this time, he could cross one or two hundred kilometers.

He looked at A Dai, who was panting beside him. “Is there another way?”

A Dai thought for a while and hesitantly said, “There is one. But it's a dead end. I can't get through it. However, you should be able to.”

When A Dai said the word “master,” he spoke with a stammer. He still didn’t know if this man had accepted him as a disciple, but seeing Su Nantian’s expression, he felt relieved. It seemed he didn’t care much.

“Take me there.” Su Nantian said simply in three words.

A Dai led Su Nantian north. The two of them quickly reached a cliff.

A chain bridge stretched across the opposite side, more like a single lonely chain spanning between two mountains. Below was an abyss covered by trees.

This height would not kill him if it snowed, but he’d likely be crippled.

Su Nantian felt happy upon seeing this bridge. At last, he wouldn’t have to climb the mountain. If he crossed this chain, it would take no time.

But before that, he needed to rest and adjust his condition. Otherwise, falling halfway would be a big mistake. He must prepare thoroughly; otherwise, he couldn’t save Xiao Wang and might die here.

Su Nantian felt the surrounding spiritual energy, which seemed quite abundant. In this green forest, everywhere was full of life.

“Regain your strength. I'll take you across later.” Su Nantian said calmly and then sat cross-legged, absorbing the surrounding spiritual energy.

A Dai was shocked by this sentence. Across? Just a single chain? Did he really mean to cross?

A Dai looked at the abyss below and felt his heart tremble. If he fell, he’d likely be crushed.

At first, when he saw this chain, he had already given up. That mountain took him nearly three days to climb.

Seeing his master regaining strength, he couldn’t slack off. He immediately sat down and followed Su Nantian’s instructions to absorb spiritual energy.

But he clearly felt a huge vortex nearby, with countless light points rushing into it. This made the spiritual energy he could use very limited.

However, his current spiritual energy hadn’t been consumed much. It seemed to have increased slightly. As he slowly absorbed it, he suddenly felt a barrier, as if breaking through.

Immediately after, his previous bottleneck state disappeared. Spiritual energy flowed more smoothly into his body. This made A Dai very happy. He felt his strength had increased again.

A Dai’s breakthrough was naturally sensed by Su Nantian. This speed surprised him greatly. He had underestimated this kid’s talent.

After saving Xiao Wang, he would look into this kid further.

One hour later, Su Nantian slowly stood up and took a deep breath. “A Dai, it's time to depart.”

Hearing Su Nantian’s words, A Dai quickly got up and looked at Su Nantian with reverence. His mind still couldn’t imagine that such a wide distance could be crossed by just one chain.

In his understanding, it was completely impossible. No one could do this.

His eyes looked strangely at Su Nantian, this master seemed so confident. Did he really do it? It was not human.

Before he could think further, Su Nantian had him on his back and took a step. A Dai screamed in fear.

Su Nantian’s figure slowly descended, then landed steadily on the chain. One step, two steps, three steps.

As Su Nantian took each step forward, his pace became faster. It felt like walking on flat ground.

A Dai, who was on Su Nantian’s back, was stunned. He felt no movement at all, as if he hadn’t moved. But the changing scenery constantly reminded him that this person was crossing the chain.

A Dai was so shocked he couldn’t think. He simply couldn’t understand how this person did it.

Soon, Su Nantian had crossed half the distance. His figure remained steady without any movement.

If a third party saw this, they would think it was an illusion. Su Nantian’s figure looked like a feather, light and passing through.

It was like magic. No one could do it unless they saw it was fake, but they didn’t know the secret.

When Su Nantian was about 100 meters from the other side, he suddenly pushed off with his feet and flew into the air. He landed again, and Su Nantian was already on the other side, his feet touching the ground.

When Su Nantian put A Dai down, he was speechless. He had no words to describe the feelings this experience brought him.

Only two words: shock.

Deeply shocked, heart-shaking.

Everything that happened today completely overturned his understanding. In his mind, no one could do it—not even the people in his tribe.

He even felt too afraid to look at Su Nantian.

“There’s nothing to be shocked about. You can do it too in the future.” Su Nantian said calmly.

A Dai’s mood, which had just calmed down, was immediately excited again. He could do it too!

If he could, then his revenge would be possible. If he had this ability, killing them should be easy—perhaps even effortless.

He thought of the Demon Sect’s leader. For the first time, he had courage to face it and hope to defeat him.

This goal no longer seemed so daunting. Previously, this goal was like an endless mountain path he could never cross or reach the peak. But he had never given up.

“A Dai, let’s go.” Su Nantian looked at A Dai staring blankly. This kid had stared too much on the way. That was why he looked so clueless.

“Ah, okay, Master. Wait for me.” A Dai quickly caught up. He had to tightly grasp this leg because only then did he have hope.

The two continued their journey. After a day, they reached the foot of the second mountain. Su Nantian finally agreed to rest and replenish their strength.

This time, A Dai voluntarily offered to hunt for prey. After two days of continuous travel, his steps had gradually improved.

Chapter 938: Life-or-Death Crisis

A Dai turned and disappeared into the forest. Su Nantian watched A Dai’s back with a smile on his lips. This kid had a good heart, very kind.

It might be due to deep-seated obsession that made him seem clueless.

A Dai quickly moved through the forest. His steps were light, making no sound at all. Soon he found prey—a wounded wolf. This size was more than they could eat.

A Dai hadn’t expected such luck. The creature looked like it was about to die. He didn’t think twice and stealthily approached, ending its life with one knife.

As he prepared to take the gift back, he couldn’t move. Something had a foot on it, holding it down firmly. He used all his strength but couldn’t pull it.

This was clearly a competitor for food.

A Dai narrowed his eyes, looking at the clothes. He was shocked—this outfit must be from the tribe, but he had never seen this style.

A Dai immediately became alert. He held his dagger in front of his chest and asked cautiously, “Who are you?”

But A Dai didn’t give up the prey.

“You ask who I am? I’d like to know who you are. What are you doing alone at this hour?” The youth questioned back, not answering A Dai’s question.

“I’m not important. This prey is mine.” A Dai pulled again, but it still wouldn’t budge.

The youth said defiantly, “I wounded this prey. Otherwise, with your cultivation level of just two stages, you couldn’t subdue it.”

Saying that, the youth pushed down with his foot to take the prey.

A Dai saw it was no good and thought quickly. He shot his dagger directly at the animal’s spine.

Pshhh! The entire spine was severed. Under their mutual tugging, it split in two.

The youth’s expression turned slightly angry. He hadn’t expected to get only half, which made him furious. No one had ever dared to take something from him before; those who offended him usually met a grim end.

A Dai saw the prey was secured and ran away without hesitation. He clearly felt this person was much stronger than him. Fighting would be no match.

So he decided to find his master first. His mysterious techniques had already been witnessed.

He definitely couldn’t handle this kid.

A Dai’s steps changed unpredictably, instantly disappearing from the spot. The youth looked at this and was slightly surprised. The subtlety of these steps made even him feel excited.

The youth decided to chase after it. The step method was his. As he chased, he felt increasingly amazed—he couldn’t catch up and could only barely keep track.

After all, his speed was unattainable for many. Today he had met someone who could outpace him, which few would believe. Especially since it was just a kid at the second cultivation stage.

Chasing a seventh-stage cultivator with only a second-stage one was so exhausting. This showed how miraculous the kid’s technique was.

At this moment, A Dai felt his hair stand on end. A life-or-death crisis arose from within him, making him fearfully cold. If he had known this result beforehand, he would have definitely given up the prey and not taken it at all.

It was too late to regret. He could only pray to return quickly, hoping to see his master one last time before dying.
