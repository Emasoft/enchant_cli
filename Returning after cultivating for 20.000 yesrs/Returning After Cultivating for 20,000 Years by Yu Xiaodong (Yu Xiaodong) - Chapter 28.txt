At that moment, the head of the Wu family stared with disbelief in his eyes, as if he wanted to question Su Nantian. Yet he could not utter a single word.

Yet from his gaze, Su Nantian still discerned the meaning he wished to convey:

"You... you're not playing fair, brother. Not following the usual tactics!"

The Wu family head had been brash and overconfident, never expecting to die so thoroughly! Su Nantian examined him for a long while—his soul had truly scattered, leaving no chance of revival.

It was astonishingly weak.

Yet during the inspection, he discovered that the head's soul aura had rotted to an alarming degree, as if it had existed for a thousand years!

This phenomenon made Su Nantian feel puzzled. Even in the cultivation world spanning twenty thousand years, he had never encountered such a case.

A soul rotted for a millennium yet still retained its consciousness—this was truly a miracle.

A thousand-year-old monster with preserved awareness, yet its soul had rotted to such an extent—it was utterly bewildering.

After inspecting the Wu family head's corpse, Su Nantian found no strange objects—only an ancient copper bell.

At that moment, the Wu family's former elders had already fled in panic, vanishing into unknown places.

The scene now held only Su Nantian and Sun Peng—oh, and a raven!

Su Nantian cast a glance at Sun Peng without saying much. He picked up the bell and carefully probed it with his spiritual awareness, discovering it was a summoning artifact connected to some place within the Wu family's ancestral mansion.

Following the bell's resonance, Su Nantian walked toward the rear courtyard of the Wu family mansion. For reasons unknown, Sun Peng did not take this opportunity to flee but instead followed Su Nantian.

Su Nantian ignored him. Though he acknowledged Sun Peng's talent in swordsmanship, his cultivation method was truly subpar and posed no threat to him. If he wished to follow, then let him.

Su Nantian held the bell and walked step by step toward the back courtyard. Finally, he stopped before a small, dilapidated old house.

"Senior Fifth, could you please explain what this building is used for?"

Su Nantian glanced at it from the outside but found no clues. He turned toward a direction and asked.

Hidden in the shadows, Senior Fifth had been discovered and could do nothing but force a laugh as he stepped forward.

"This... Master Su, this building I don't know what it's for. Since the Wu family existed, it has always been a forbidden place. Only the current head of the family could enter it; no one else was allowed to approach.

So, you see..."

Senior Fifth explained everything he knew and smiled broadly, fearing Su Nantian's anger.

Though the building seemed different, Su Nantian found no signs of danger. He waved his hand for Senior Fifth to leave and approached the dilapidated house with the bell.

Though it looked like a run-down building, Su Nantian noticed its quality was actually quite good. It had many arrays and talismans inscribed within, but these differed from the usual cultivation world's methods, emitting a strange aura.

"Is this... Fengwen? Lu Ban techniques?"

Su Nantian briefly examined it, curiosity piqued. Though Lu Ban techniques were of little use to Su Nantian, their essence had been lost for centuries. He never expected to find them in this house!

He lightly pressed two streams of energy, breaking the building's arrays. He then pushed open the wooden door and stepped inside. Sun Peng followed him in.

Chapter 128: A Gift of Opportunity

From the outside, the room seemed unremarkable. Yet upon entering, it felt spacious. However, there was nothing extraordinary—only simple daily necessities, their styles outdated and reminiscent of the 1960s and 1970s.

Sun Peng entered this space and surveyed it with curiosity. Yet he found no issues, turning his gaze back to Su Nantian.

He noticed Su Nantian had walked toward a corner, tapping the floor with his fingers. The taps seemed rhythmic and deliberate.

After several strikes, a deep rumbling sound echoed from beneath the floor. Su Nantian stepped back and watched as the section of the floor suddenly sank, revealing a passage.

Without hesitation, Su Nantian leapt down!

Beneath this entrance lay a vast hall. The room was illuminated by burning oil, casting an eerie glow.

The first thing Su Nantian saw upon entering was a shrine ahead. Upon this shrine stood a towering statue of a deity—perhaps not a god at all, but rather a demon or some malevolent entity.

This statue stood about two and a half meters tall, its muscular form exuding strength. Yet it had wide, staring eyes as if attempting to descend from the shrine.

Su Nantian shook the bell in his hand. Though the statue showed no immediate change, its eyes turned toward the bell's location.

"It seems this is it! But this thing looks like a corpse!"

Su Nantian examined it thoroughly, confirming it was indeed a corpse—more specifically, a zombie. Even more terrifying, this corpse wasn't of an ordinary dead person. Or rather, the corpse's original owner had just died. In Su Nantian's perception, this corpse and the ancient, rotted soul were perfectly matched—they were one and the same!

"This... is quite interesting."

Su Nantian observed the zombie, murmuring. He then searched this space and found two books on the altar before the zombie.

One of them clearly bore the title "Qingming Gui Tian Jian" (The Qingming Return to Heaven Scripture) in large characters.

Clearly, this was the mysterious and secret martial art passed down through generations of the Wu family.

Though Su Nantian had no intention of changing his cultivation method, he was intrigued and opened it briefly. He found this technique to be utterly inferior in terms of combat power or other aspects.

Yet it possessed one extraordinary ability—nearly granting eternal life!

The Wu family head's direct lineage was always a single heir, and even if the head had siblings, only the eldest could cultivate this technique.

It wasn't because of any unique characteristics in the method, but rather it was selecting a vessel.

Since the first Wu family member to cultivate this "Qingming Return to Heaven Scripture," each generation's practitioner had merely been a vessel. For years, the Wu family head was actually one and the same person.

When the old head's lifespan ended, he would transfer into a new body. This was why Su Nantian had felt the soul's decay spanning a thousand years.

Though this technique was cruel, it had no connection to Su Nantian. They were like separate worlds.

But by chance, the chosen successor of the old head was the father of the current head—this man who now occupied this body.

Cultivating "Qingming Return to Heaven Scripture" would produce an Essence Pearl, channeling the transformation of yin and yang, life and death. This Essence Pearl was the Wu family's inheritance treasure, enabling the old head to reincarnate through possession.

The father of the current head had discovered something, sensed something, or perhaps an accident occurred. During a journey, he died unexpectedly and lost the Essence Pearl.

The old head could sense this pearl. He dispatched the Wu family's Grand Elder to investigate, eventually discovering it had been swallowed by a raven. This caused the raven's transformation into the current Death Raven.

Without the Essence Pearl, and with his lifespan exhausted, the old head had no choice but to attempt possession of the young head while searching for the pearl.

Yet this raven, having swallowed the Essence Pearl, became Su Nantian's contracted spirit beast. This led to all the subsequent events.

Su Nantian read it twice and probed it thoroughly. He merely snorted. Though this technique boasted great power, its actual effect was limited.

If it truly allowed infinite reincarnation and immortality, it would be a remarkable scripture. But in reality, its effect was merely to sustain for a thousand years—like drinking poison to quench thirst.

Otherwise, the old head's soul wouldn't have rotted so badly.

Other than this technique, there was nothing useful in the room.

Su Nantian circled around and turned his gaze back to this small giant. Indeed, this thing was a treasure. The old head had been ruthless, forging his youthful body into a copper-armored zombie and feeding all the bodies he'd used over the past thousand years into it!

Now, this corpse had become a millennium-old golden-armored zombie—impervious to blades and fire, invincible in strength!

If this old man had summoned it, Su Nantian might not have been able to defeat it!

But he acted decisively and severed the old man's head. Otherwise, things would have been more complicated!

I circled this zombie a few times and felt happy. The heavens hadn't let me leave empty-handed! To control this zombie, the old man had completely erased its chaotic consciousness and instincts. Now it was more like a puppet.

And Su Nantian's mind had an exact method for crafting such puppets. If he could transform this golden-armored zombie into a puppet, perhaps Su Yu Jian's disciple would gain another divine general!

After all, who among the true gods doesn't have a few assistants?

Su Nantian thought this as he waved his hand, placing the corpse into his storage space.

After several repeated refinements, Su Nantian's current storage ring could easily accommodate this thing.

There was nothing worth lingering over here. Su Nantian turned back and saw Sun Peng following him.

He glanced at the sword hanging from his waist. Su Nantian paused, then decided: "Well, I'll give you a chance!"

Chapter 129: Sun Peng's Luck

Sun Peng saw Su Nantian stop and turn toward him, surprised. He didn't know what this person was up to, so he hesitated on what to say.

"How... why did you stop?"

Su Nantian's lips curled slightly as he said, "I like your sword. Just..."

Sun Peng heard this and grabbed his sword hilt, stepping back in fear he would target his blade. This was a treasure that had accompanied him for nearly twenty years—how could he let it go!

Su Nantian saw his serious expression and laughed, leaving Sun Peng confused. He frowned at him, wondering if this person was crazy.

Su Nantian laughed and then said calmly: "Don't be afraid. I never take what belongs to others. But your sword is a rare spiritual object. If used properly, it will surely become unstoppable!"

"Really?"

Sun Peng stepped forward and looked into Su Nantian's eyes, eager to confirm it wasn't a lie.

His meaning implied he had greater opportunities. If he truly mastered it, the Qingyang Sword Sect would be his alone—no one would dare to look down on him again!

"Why would I lie? But your talent is average. Even with diligence, it won't bring much effect."

Sun Peng widened his eyes, disbelieving. How could this be! His master had always said he was intelligent and unmatched by others, yet this person dared to say such things!

But the recent events made him believe. He had seen this young man's power crush the Wu family head—his master wouldn't even be able to move him!

Thinking this, Sun Peng's gaze toward Su Nantian became more respectful. This change was already noticed by Su Nantian.

He didn't waste words but took out an old blue book from his storage space. Sun Peng's eyes caught a few characters on it: "The World and I Alone."

Su Nantian took it out and flipped through it. This was obtained earlier from the Gao family by chance. Though its use wasn't great, he had kept it just in case. Unexpectedly, it was useful now.

After reading it, Su Nantian waved his hand and tossed it into Sun Peng's arms. He said calmly: "I don't need this anymore. When you have time, read it—it will help you."

After saying that, he crossed his arms and walked away.

Sun Peng stared at Su Nantian's departure in shock. He looked down at the book and realized how much help it would give him.

His trembling lips and hands formed a fist, shouting toward Su Nantian's back: "Thank you for your help, brother! I'll never forget it!"

But Su Nantian had already disappeared. The wind lifted his robe, and sunlight met him head-on—like a deity descending from heaven, and he was the god!

Su Nantian's figure gradually vanished. He used a concealment technique to fly onto the ground. As he reached flat land and revealed himself, a fireball was hurled at him. The crackling sound of burning filled the air.

"Ha! Trivial tricks!"

Su Nantian let out a light sneer, moved his fingers to block the fireball and sent it back in the opposite direction. The speed was hundreds of times faster!

"Ahh!" As the fireball fell, a rough scream echoed from afar.

Su Nantian shook his head. Some people were just too overconfident. He took a step forward and stood before the man, looking down at his trembling face.

This man was none other than Senior Fifth. He had finally found his conscience and mustered courage for this one time.

For so many years, he had followed the elder brother's side, protected by them. Now that the Wu family was in such a state, if he continued to live like this, how could he face the ancestors after death?

So during Su Nantian's investigation, he hid behind a rock to ambush. But the disparity was too great—he hadn't even started before it ended.

Seeing Su Nantian approach, his courage deflated like a deflated balloon. His pants were soaked with warm liquid.

His lips trembled, unsure how to beg for mercy.

Su Nantian frowned. He had lived two thousand years and never seen such a disgraceful person. A senior official who was scared to tears—this Wu family had many useless people.

He prepared to kill him with a technique, but the man grabbed his pants leg. Senior Fifth was crying and sobbing, kneeling at Su Nantian's feet.

"Please, spare me! I was blinded by madness and shouldn't have ambushed you!"

"I deserve death. Please forgive me this time, great one!"

He added more prostrations on the ground.

Su Nantian didn't listen to his whining anymore. He gathered a stream of energy in his hand and annihilated him.

This man's begging was already enough, but he had also soiled his pants. Who dared to disrespect him in heaven?

After wiping his hands, Su Nantian walked through the Wu family's ruins without looking back. He continued walking out.

To Su Nantian, it was simple—victory and defeat. No need to pity anyone.

Exiting the Wu family's gate, his Rolls-Royce was still intact.

Su Nantian opened the car door and sat in the driver's seat, feeling calm. He thought he might come back to the Wu family again and gain more.

His shoulder's Death Raven, sensing his thoughts, "Ghah! Ghah!" flapped its wings and called out with him.

It meant, "We're so great! Next time there's such an opportunity, take me too!"

Su Nantian found it amusing and lightly tapped its forehead with his hand.

"Awooo!" The Death Raven flapped its wings, holding its head in pain and looking at Su Nantian with a pained expression. It thought, "Now I'm also an emperor among ravens, yet you treat me like this."

He ignored the Death Raven on his shoulder and stepped on the accelerator, drifting on the road back to Fengyue Residential Area.

The rapid movement blew the Death Raven's feathers into a middle part, and it pale-facedly restrained its pounding heart.

"Wow! I'm going to die at this speed!" Of course, it only thought this in its mind. After all, a bird still had dignity.

Su Nantian got out of the car and opened the door. He saw Lin Suyun, Gao Jingjing, and Yao Lina standing by the sofa, their eyes filled with excitement.

Looking closely, tears were in their eyes. Gao Jingjing had her lips pouted, looking at him with resentment, making Su Nantian's lower abdomen tighten as if he wanted to devour her.

He barely suppressed this impulse and walked over to them, embracing the three of them in his arms.

Gao Jingjing's face turned red as she shyly looked at him.

Su Nantian mentally recited that he shouldn't do this with two other girls, restraining his urge to comfort her.

Chapter 130: The Madness Before the School Year

This slight change did not escape Lin Suyun's eyes. Her expression darkened, and she subconsciously lowered her head, intertwining her fingers. She took a deep breath and lifted her head with a smile, hooking Su Nantian's arm and pulling him to sit on the sofa.

Su Nantian followed her steps, glancing back at Gao Jingjing and Yao Lina.

Lin Suyun tugged his sleeve, worriedly scanning his body: "Nantian, have you been injured?"

Though she already knew Su Nantian's strength, he was the one she loved most. She still couldn't help worrying about his safety.

Su Nantian felt warm at the sight of this woman. He grabbed her soft hand and teased: "How could I be? Who would take care of you if I were injured?"

"Ahh, you're annoying... they're still here," Lin Suyun blushed and hit Su Nantian's chest to make him stop. Though she enjoyed showing affection, her kindness made her unwilling for him to continue.

"Hey, what are you two doing just standing there? Come sit here!" Lin Suyun remembered the two sisters at the door and waved them over.

Gao Jingjing and Yao Lina saw the two on the sofa laughing, both feeling like a vinegar jar had broken in their hearts.

Hearing Lin Suyun's call, they put aside their thoughts and forced a smile to sit beside them.

The sofa fit four people perfectly. Su Nantian looked at the long legs of each girl and felt his heart fluttering.

"Even if I've cultivated for two thousand years, can you be as carefree as me?"

Thinking this, he secretly touched Lin Suyun's hand, causing her to let out a soft voice.

Su Nantian playfully pinched it again. Lin Suyun was afraid others would see, so she couldn't make a sound but glared at Su Nantian.

Of course, this had no effect on Su Nantian. He just smiled at her.

Yao Lina sat next to Gao Jingjing, idly scrolling through her phone. Suddenly, she looked up and said: "Oh, I just remembered—Nantian, we have school tomorrow."

"Is it that fast?"

Su Nantian rubbed his head, feeling he hadn't played for long before school started.

"Yes. There are only two days left. How about we have a midnight party today?"

"Great! Let's call more people," Yao Lina was the first to agree. She was a night club princess, loving these things.

They immediately started organizing. Lin Suyun called the hotel manager to transform their home into a small party, filling the table with various wines.

Yao Lina called over her female friends. Of course, only girls—most of the guys she knew were interested in her, but she wasn't.

Gao Jingjing was the youngest among them and just took care of others.

Soon, the doorbell rang. Yao Lina ran to open it: "Wow, you came so fast."

"You called us, we wouldn't dare be late," a sweet voice came from outside. This made Su Nantian turn his head.

He saw a pair of long legs entering, then four girls walked in together.

"Hi, Lin Suyun!" The girls greeted Lin Suyun and looked at Gao Jingjing and Su Nantian with confusion, wondering who they were.

Especially Su Nantian's deep eyes and strong nose were too handsome! They all wanted to kneel at his jeans.

Seeing the friends' confusion, Yao Lina slapped her head: "Oh, I forgot. This is Gao Jingjing, our little sister. And that's Su Nantian, our current landlord and good friend."

She ran to Su Nantian's side, rubbing her face against his shoulder and asking: "Is that right, Nantian?"

Su Nantian could see her trickery. He sighed inwardly, thinking women were troublesome but smiled indulgently and pinched her nose.

"Yes, yes. Whatever you say is right."

Seeing their close relationship, they all thought this world-renowned handsome man should have met them first. But thinking was one thing, and Lin Suyun and Yao Lina were untouchable.

They could only smile awkwardly and enter the house, lamenting their bad luck.

Everything was ready. They drank heavily and laughed, even splashing wine and cake everywhere.

Late at night, they were all drunk. Lin Suyun sat closest to Su Nantian and watched his handsome profile, tears flowing.

Suddenly, a girl accidentally smeared cake on Lin Suyun's clothes. This startled her out of her dream.

"Sorry, Suyun! I didn't mean to!"

The girl was flustered and didn't know where to put her hands.

Seeing these girls who were all looking at him with longing, Lin Suyun felt jealous. Her noblewoman's demeanor made her just wave her hand and say it was fine.

Lin Suyun got up to change clothes. The sound of water could be heard from the bedroom.

After a long time, they were all drunk. Yao Lina sent the girls away and fell asleep on the nearest sofa.

Gao Jingjing, that little girl, had already fallen asleep in her room. Lin Suyun was nowhere to be found.

Su Nantian was also slightly drunk, leaning on the table and watching Yao Lina lying there. He worried she might catch a cold at night, but no thoughts of desire.

Su Nantian sighed. He picked up Yao Lina and carried her to her room.

Oh, don't look at this girl who was slim before—she had quite a bit of meat on her. Su Nantian thought to himself.

Her two little white rabbits pressed against his chest, and he gently placed her on the bed. He then used his hand to squeeze them.

Yao Lina, still asleep, let out a soft sound and pushed his forehead: "Ah... it hurts..."

Hearing this, Su Nantian withdrew his mischievous hand and regretted his self-control had become so poor.

No more thoughts. He tucked Yao Lina in and left her room, then touched his already erect second brother.

Ah! It was really painful to not be able to have it!

Su Nantian grumbled and opened his room. He turned on the light and was startled—Lin Suyun was kneeling on his bed, her eyes wet as she looked at him.

She wore a limited edition set she had bought.

What was going on?

Su Nantian swallowed his saliva and stepped to the bed.

Chapter 131: The First Day of School

As he reached the bed, Lin Suyun pulled him onto it. His head hit her body.

"Ugh..." Lin Suyun let out a soft moan, making Su Nantian's heart flutter. The fire he had felt from Yao Lina returned.

His hands immediately covered the desired treasure.

Though it was small, it had a lot of flavor.

The other hand wasn't idle either. It ran down her stomach, and Lin Suyun closed her eyes in tension.

Su Nantian gave her no chance to retreat and kissed her immediately.

Lin Suyun tilted her head back, eyes dazed with lips open.

"Ah... Nantian, be gentle. It hurts."

Su Nantian heard her call too loudly and feared disturbing the other two girls. He covered her lips with his.

"Ah... um... be gentle..."

They spent the night without stopping, and the poor bed shook all night.

In between, Gao Jingjing got up to get a glass of water. Su Nantian was meditating on the bed, and Lin Suyun was too exhausted to get up.

Thus, they all woke up the next morning for school.

Gao Jingjing knocked on their door one by one: "Get up, get up! Yao Lina has already made breakfast."

Su Nantian and Lin Suyun got out of bed. Of course, they had another battle.

Sitting at the table, Gao Jingjing and Yao Lina saw them coming out of one room and felt jealous.

Gao Jingjing pouted in her mind, thinking: "I don't want to see Nantian with other sisters on the same bed. But I can't do anything about it."

Yao Lina directly teased: "Suyun, you're really something. That's why I didn't see you that night—because you had plans."

Hearing her friend say this, Lin Suyun blushed and glared at Yao Lina's trickery. If she hadn't missed Nantian so much, would they have had the chance to tease her?

She smiled and said: "I was guilty for keeping it from you. Don't be upset, next time it'll be you."

She said this but felt sad secretly.

Yao Lina and Gao Jingjing heard it and their eyes lit up. She was right—after all, Nantian wasn't just hers!

Su Nantian silently drank his soup and didn't make much noise, fearing he would be flayed alive.

After finishing breakfast and tidying up, Su Nantian drove Gao Jingjing to school in the Rolls-Royce. He said goodbye to Lin Suyun and Yao Lina, who were reluctant.

After they left, Lin Suyun closed the door and sat on the sofa with Yao Lina.

"Do you think Nantian might like that little girl?" Yao Lina's voice echoed in the room, making Lin Suyun confront this issue.

Yao Lina leaned on her chin and continued: "She's so young, and she looks good."

Saying this, she glanced at the person beside her. "Suyun, I'm afraid Nantian might like her. After all, they're always together."

Lin Suyun sighed and rubbed her small face. She thought of Gao Jingjing's innocence: "Don't worry, I believe in him. Even if Nantian likes her, we're not bad either."

If she truly thought this way, where did this sense of loss come from?

"Yes! You're right!" Yao Lina encouraged herself and smiled confidently.

Meanwhile, Su Nantian and Gao Jingjing drove quickly to the entrance of Fengyue University. The Death Raven on his shoulder had been placed at home earlier to avoid chaos.

As Su Nantian stopped the car, he got out of the passenger seat and opened the door for Gao Jingjing. She steadied herself just in time to see a crowd of people at the school gate.

He was confused and asked Su Nantian beside him: "Nantian, what are they doing?"

Su Nantian didn't know either. "Let's go see."

After saying that, he stepped forward and took Gao Jingjing's hand to walk over.

Actually, Su Nantian wasn't curious or interested in what was happening. But Gao Jingjing's curiosity was too strong, and he couldn't resist her innocent gaze. He had to take her to find out.

The crowd heard the sound of the Rolls-Royce and turned around. Some girls covered their mouths.

"Wow! A Rolls-Royce!"

"What's so special about it? If you're ugly, money won't help."

A girl heard this and was dismissive. But the next second she couldn't speak after seeing Su Nantian's face: "Wow... he's so handsome..."

"Ah! He came! He's coming!"

"No, he has a woman with him. Oh no, she's taken!"

"Who is this girl? Isn't it Xu Dacheng who was pursuing Gao Jingjing?"

"Seems like it..."

The crowd surrounding Xu Wenhao heard this and pushed through the crowd. He directly faced Su Nantian, holding a bouquet of red roses.

Gao Jingjing now understood why there were so many people. She felt guilty for causing this trouble, making Su Nantian see it on the first day.

She gently tugged Su Nantian's sleeve: "Nantian... I don't want to go. We should leave early for registration."

Actually, Su Nantian had already heard what they said. He clearly knew the situation.

Though he felt it was too cowardly to leave now, seeing his woman's face皱成 a frown made him unwilling to tease her further.

Just as he was about to take Gao Jingjing away, the people in front seemed to sense his intention and sneered.

"I said you're scared. Why leave so soon?"

Su Nantian stopped, and gently pinched Gao Jingjing's face to keep her behind him.

He didn't answer Xu Wenhao but just stared at him.

Xu Wenhao felt uneasy and, thinking of his long pursuit for the goddess who had now fallen into another man's arms, couldn't help mocking.

"Hey Gao Jingjing, you said earlier that you were still young. How come now you've gone to another man's house? You're so pure and clean, aren't you?"

Xu Wenhao's friends also joined in: "That's right. I didn't expect you to be like this!"

Gao Jingjing, who had been spoiled since childhood, hadn't experienced such humiliation. She turned red and pale, tears falling as she looked at Su Nantian.

Chapter 132: The First Signs of Trouble

Seeing Gao Jingjing crying like a rain-soaked plum blossom, Su Nantian felt some pity.

Gao Jingjing wiped her tears and said: "You're all being too harsh."

"Is it us who are being harsh, or you?" One of Xu Wenhao's subordinates spoke up to defend his master.

Most importantly, he wanted to have a say in front of his master.

"You know what? Our master is willing to look at you. That's a favor. What about you? You're still pretending to be modest. I spit on that!"

Gao Jingjing had never been insulted like this before and didn't know how to respond. She looked up at Su Nantian with tears in her eyes.

Su Nantian was always helpless against women's gentle attacks. He resigned himself to pulling Gao Jingjing behind him, which surprised her.

"Nantian..."

She was one of the most famous people in this school. No man had dared to touch her before, but now Su Nantian had done so. This made Gao Jingjing feel an unprecedented fluttering in her heart.

Gao Jingjing's heart felt safe, as if this broad shoulder could give her a sense of security. This made her no longer fear Xu Wenhao.

Xu Wenhao saw Su Nantian appear and even stand in front of Gao Jingjing. This posture seemed to want to protect her from these people.

Xu Wenhao was also proud and, with so many people watching, if he retreated, the next day would be a disaster. So Xu Wenhao pushed aside the subordinate who had spoken to him.

The man was also wise and stepped back respectfully behind Xu Wenhao, but his eyes were fierce toward Su Nantian.

"Hey! Who are you? Do you know what you're meddling in?"

"Don't know."

Su Nantian's calm response to Xu Wenhao's arrogance was like talking to an unimportant person.

Even in the next second, Su Nantian ignored Xu Wenhao and directly said to Gao Jingjing behind him: "Don't be afraid. I'll go in with you, and I'll always be by your side."

"Okay." Gao Jingjing felt sweet. No stranger had ever cared for her like this before, and she now saw Su Nantian as her support.

After saying that, Su Nantian wanted to take Gao Jingjing away. Everyone was surprised by this action, even Xu Wenhao, who saw the scene and was speechless.
