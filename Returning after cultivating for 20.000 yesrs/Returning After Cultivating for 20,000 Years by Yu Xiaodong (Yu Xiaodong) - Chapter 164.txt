It is unwise to provoke Ahao under these circumstances. It's not that they necessarily fear Ahao, but in this situation, it is unnecessary to clash directly. One must protect oneself and wait for Su Nantian's arrival before teaching them a lesson.

As the saying goes, "The gun shoots the head bird." Even Chen Xiaoling understands this principle. However, Chen Xiaoling's impulsive nature caused her to forget this crucial point.

After being provoked by him, Ahao immediately became enraged. "You little brat! What are you saying? Do you dare to be arrogant under these circumstances? Do you know who he is? Daring to speak like that in front of Long Ge?"

Ahao directly brought up Long Ge and attributed Chen Xiaoling's defiant words to him, as if she were opposing Long Ge himself.

Long Ge was already in a bad mood because these villagers did not cooperate with him. Now, seeing Chen Xiaoling dare to provoke him, Long Ge became even more enraged.

"Bang!"

Long Ge was a man who spoke little but was ruthless. Now provoked by Chen Xiaoling, he immediately shot at her.

Fortunately, he had no intention of killing her outright but instead shot her in the abdomen.

"Ahh!"

Chen Xiaoling immediately let out a pained cry and fell to the ground.

"Brother! Are you alright?"

At this moment, Chen Xiaoling was shocked and rushed to support her brother. She never expected that the opponent would act so violently without hesitation, using such a ruthless method.

She was terrified; her eyes immediately turned red. She quickly pressed her hand against her brother's wound, anxiously asking: "How are you, Brother!"

Chapter 819: Coming with Force

Chen Xiaoling's tears seemed to flow without end, making people feel heartbroken.

"I told you not to argue with him! Why are you still so foolish, Brother? You're such a big fool!"

Chen Xiaoling was heartbroken by her brother's injury but also angry at his disobedience. She had told him not to oppose these people, yet he still did so.

Chen Xiaoling pressed her hand against the wound while scolding her brother.

The other villagers, witnessing this scene, all gasped in shock. Clearly, they had expected Long Ge to be so ruthless.

Even Ahao, who stood beside him, was frightened by Long Ge's actions. Although Ahao had wanted to teach Chen Xiaoling a lesson, he hadn't expected Long Ge to act so decisively.

After being startled, Ahao began to feel relieved. Fortunately, he hadn't offended Long Ge earlier. He had quickly yielded and said no wrong words, avoiding offending Long Ge.

Otherwise, he would have been the one lying on the ground like Chen Xiaoling.

"Still not willing to bring him out?"

Long Ge sneered, finding the villagers of Xiaoyu Village foolish and laughable. He was not a kind person; returning to Xiaoyu Village was not for charity. He simply wanted to capture Su Nantian and return to report to Hongye.

Anyone who obstructed him would not be spared. The previous Chen Xiaoling was a living example of this.

Chen Xiaoling could not speak, and the pain almost made her faint.

Chen Xiaoling tightly embraced her brother with deep compassion, tears like broken pearls falling endlessly without stopping. She should have reminded her brother earlier.

Knowing how impulsive her brother was and that he had clashed with Ahao, she should have quickly stopped him. Otherwise, it wouldn't have come to this.

The other villagers also rushed over in panic, worrying about Chen Xiaoling's wound and fearing for her life. However, they soon had no time to care about Chen Xiaoling.

Because Long Ge's patience was limited. Shooting Chen Xiaoling had ignited his inner bloodlust, and now he prepared to open fire recklessly.

"I give you one last chance. If you don't hand him over, I won't be merciful."

After saying this, Long Ge deliberately blew on the gun's barrel. The hidden meaning was obvious.

At this moment, Long Ge continued to threaten Chen Xiaoling. His eyes were extremely sinister and swept over the innocent villagers.

After being seen by Long Ge's gaze, everyone shivered involuntarily and their shoulders trembled uncontrollably.

Seeing this, Long Ge felt no pity for the villagers but found their foolishness amusing. His eyes became even more erratic, and he intentionally played with his gun, warning the villagers to cooperate quickly.

At this moment, Ahao saw Long Ge's demeanor and took a step back, trying to distance himself from Long Ge.

Ahao now felt that cooperating with Long Ge and his group was like making a deal with a tiger. If he made one mistake, it would be his end without knowing how he died.

No matter how much Ahao feared them now, he dared not show it. He was afraid of becoming the next target for Long Ge's attack.

So, he swallowed a large amount of saliva and quickly suppressed his inner tension. His hands hung at his sides, and in that brief moment, they were already damp.

"Still not decided?"

Long Ge coldly spoke at this time. His voice carried a clear threat, and his eyes showed no regard for these people.

The meaning of Long Ge's words was very clear. He did not consider the villagers of Xiaoyu Village as anything, and killing them was as simple as crushing an ant. He would feel no psychological pressure at all.

The reason why Long Ge gave them so many chances was to get Su Nantian out of them.

The villagers understood what Long Ge meant and knew he was a ruthless person. He had already shot Chen Xiaoling without hesitation, and now Chen Xiaoling was weak and lying on the ground with no strength to get up.

Although they were very afraid, they knew Long Ge was not a good person. If he found Su Nantian, he might do worse to him.

Thinking of this, the villagers did not want to tell Long Ge. They all looked away as if that would make them avoid Long Ge's orders, but their actions were like stealing ears while covering one's eyes.

However, this action had already made Long Ge understand their meaning.

Long Ge hadn't expected that he had spoken so clearly and even shot Chen Xiaoling to warn them. He thought these people would be terrified, crying out, and tell him where Su Nantian was. Then he could easily confirm whether they were the people they sought and return to report to Hongye.

But Long Ge never expected these people to be so stubborn, not even scared by the gun.

"Good! Good! So you have backbone, huh?"

At this moment, Long Ge sneered and looked at the villagers with obvious contempt. To him, their persistence was nothing but a joke, even making him feel ridiculed and amused.

"You'd better keep this backbone and smile too!"

Long Ge said these words, then suddenly shot another villager. The villager let out a pained cry and fell to the ground immediately.

The place he was shot was his thigh, not fatal. However, the blood flowing out continuously was enough to scare people. In no time, it stained the place where the villager lay down.

It looked extremely terrifying.

Long Ge's action had truly frightened these villagers, who gasped again in shock. They never expected Long Ge to be so heartless and had already acted without hesitation, even randomly injuring people.

Chapter 820: The Final Threat

Behind Long Ge, AChuan and his group had calm expressions. They showed no signs of suppression at all, as if Long Ge's actions were nothing unusual to them.

Because of their calm expressions, Ahao was once again startled. He truly feared now, thinking he had provoked a devil and not a human.

If Ahao was still gloating earlier, hoping these villagers would be severely punished by Long Ge and his group, now he felt a sense of sorrow for the rabbit's fate.

If even these villagers could not escape Long Ge's wrath, what about him?

After knowing this, how would Long Ge and his group punish him afterwards? Would they kill him directly or cripple another hand?

Thinking of this, Ahao shivered uncontrollably. He found Long Ge unfamiliar and they were like a monster wearing human skin.

But fear was fear; Ahao would never dare to say his true feelings.

He even held his breath, keeping his breathing as quiet as possible, fearing that he would draw Long Ge's attention or make them discontented and shoot him.

"I've told you my patience is limited."

Long Ge blew on the gun's barrel and spoke carelessly. Actually, each word was like a heavy hammer, striking every villager's heart.

Even if they were not the ones shot, they inevitably thought: would it be them next?

The old village head had lived in these small places all his life and was very simple. He had never seen a cruel person like Long Ge before.

He also hadn't seen these people threatening without success and then acting ruthlessly, with no hesitation or mercy.

Seeing Chen Xiaoling and another villager fall down, the old village head furrowed his brows. His face full of wrinkles was filled with worry.

At this moment, the old village head also didn't know what to do.

On one hand was his villagers' lives, and on the other was their debt of gratitude to Su Nantian.

No matter which choice, it was very difficult.

"Village head!"

After seeing this scene, the other villagers could no longer remain calm. They all anxiously surrounded the old village head, looking at him with fear and hoping he would provide a solution.

"What should we do? What should we do?"

The villagers all whispered, many of them pale with fear.

They were old and young. If they were shot, it was no joke at all.

"I don't belong to our village, Village Head. Perhaps..."

Some villagers were so scared by Long Ge's actions that they had selfish thoughts. They whispered and gritted their teeth to say this sentence.

But when they got halfway through, they felt too ashamed to continue.

After all, Su Nantian was not a villager but also Uncle Wang's relative and had helped them so much.

But now, when there was trouble, they wanted to push him out, making them seem like cowards who valued their lives.

This villager's mind quickly generated two thoughts, clashing fiercely.

One said that people who don't take care of themselves will be punished by heaven and earth. Sacrificing Su Nantian for their own survival was not a big deal. The other said they had betrayed their benefactor and would end up in hell, never having a good ending.

In short, either choice was very difficult.

Actually, the old village head's feelings were similar to the villagers. As a village head, he felt very troubled.

He could not watch his people be killed by Long Ge but also could not betray Su Nantian.

After shooting two villagers, Long Ge felt he had the upper hand and believed that the old village head would now weigh the pros and cons, knowing what to choose.

Moreover, Long Ge and his group had climbed from small hooligans to their current positions. They clearly understood human nature.

They all knew that in this situation, anyone would be selfish and choose to protect themselves.

So Long Ge thought he could soon see Su Nantian, but he never expected these villagers to be so stubborn. Even now, they still protected Su Nantian and refused to reveal his whereabouts.

This thought made Long Ge very dissatisfied and frustrated.

"I've given you a chance, do you think I only injure you but won't take your lives?"

At this moment, Long Ge narrowed his eyes and said threateningly.

He was thinking: these people must be foolish, believing that I would not kill them?

The reason he hadn't killed them directly was neither a burst of compassion nor wanting to let these villagers go.

Long Ge wanted to keep them as leverage to threaten Su Nantian when he arrived.

But this idea had become their last card.

Thinking of this, Long Ge pulled the trigger again and aimed at one villager's head. His lips curled into a bloodthirsty expression.

"Ah! No, don't!"

"Don't! Please!"

The villagers had known Long Ge was not a kind person, but they never expected him to be so heartless.

When they saw Long Ge's action, they were all startled and gasped involuntarily. They could not remain calm.

This was a gun, and Long Ge had aimed at the head this time!

There was still a chance of survival if hit elsewhere, but if it was the head, there would be nothing left.

"Don't! Please!"

Other villagers were also scared and fell to their knees, begging Long Ge for mercy. They hoped he would show mercy and not kill them.

The old village head was also frightened to the point of almost falling over, his heart nearly unable to bear it.

"Hmph! You're afraid now? I thought your bones were so hard!"

At this moment, Long Ge sneered and looked at the villagers with full contempt.

But he had no intention of actually killing anyone. This was all a tactic to threaten Su Nantian, and it could be killed but not the best timing.

Long Ge's previous action was just a fake move to warn these villagers.

Now that he saw they had indeed fallen into the trap, Long Ge let out a triumphant sneer and looked at these villagers as if they were already dead.

Chapter 821: He Has Come

"Don't say I'm bullying you."

Long Ge continued to threaten the villagers at this moment. "This is your last chance. If you are wise, quickly bring him out."

After saying this, Long Ge paused and saw the villagers instinctively shrink their shoulders. Then he continued: "Otherwise, this gun has no eyes. If it hits you, there will be no second chances!"

After saying these words, Long Ge looked at the villagers meaningfully. This gaze was full of threats and warnings to the villagers.

At this moment, AChuan also stepped forward and added: "Long Ge never lies. He says one, it's one; he says two, it's two. If you provoke Long Ge again, none of you will survive!"

AChuan's words carried full threats. His eyes also had a sinister aura, clearly intending to severely punish these villagers.

"I warn you all. Be careful and tell Long Ge what he wants to know clearly, otherwise you'll have a hard time!"

At this moment, AChuan also warned again. His eyes carried clear threats, as if he had decided to severely punish them.

"What should we do now, Village Head?"

If the villagers had previously thought that Long Ge and AChuan would not act recklessly, they had now dispelled this notion.

And now everyone was no longer willing to take the chance, they all knew that AChuan and Long Ge were not good people.

They truly said what they meant and did it, and could be ruthless without leaving any room for mercy.

The old village head was also very anxious, not knowing what to do.

But as the village head, in this situation, especially when the villagers were already very afraid, he was their backbone. He now had to make this decision.

After thinking about these things, the old village head's unease became even more.

He knew he needed to make this decision, and his reason told him that he had to save the villagers quickly.

But emotionally, it kept preventing the old village head from saying such words or making this decision.

They fell into silence again, and no one knew what to do.

"Long Ge?"

AChuan saw these villagers still didn't understand, and after he had said so many threats and given them a lesson, they hadn't made up their minds. He started to be dissatisfied.

He turned to ask Long Ge, wanting to know what he thought.

And AChuan had also prepared himself; if Long Ge said to attack, he would immediately act without missing a chance.

Especially thinking about these villagers delaying him for so long, AChuan felt that all his patience had been drained by them and he could not forgive them.

Long Ge should have given the order to open fire and warn these villagers.

But for some reason, Long Ge suddenly smiled coldly. It seemed he had thought of something amusing.

"Let's not trouble you."

At this moment, Long Ge suddenly spoke. His eyes had more depth.

But for some reason, he looked very scary now, especially the villagers who saw this Long Ge felt a chill and were uneasy.

Even though Long Ge had done nothing, seeing his expression made the villagers feel they had encountered their tragic end.

Especially thinking about this bad person, Long Ge didn't know how he would punish them.

This unknown fear often made people feel more scared, because the brain constantly imagined some terrible pictures. Even if the other party hadn't planned to do so, you would subconsciously imagine the worst outcome and the most terrible picture.

The villagers were now like this, constantly imagining how Long Ge would punish them. Even the old village head started to tremble and felt he could not maintain his composure.

Long Ge first looked at these people, then收回 his gaze. He seemed satisfied with their fear and the unease they showed when looking at him.

Long Ge was naturally this kind of person, who loved to see others fear him and loved to see others suffer.

The more the villagers feared and were uneasy, the happier Long Ge became. These people were like his nourishment; he needed to continuously absorb it to find his pleasure from the suffering of these villagers.

At this moment, the villagers didn't know what Long Ge was up to and couldn't determine how he would deal with them. So they were all anxious and dared not look at Long Ge.

At this moment, Long Ge suddenly spoke. His voice was very cold and carried a meaning.

It seemed like a hammer, striking everyone's heart. Each word struck once, making the blood color on their faces disappear immediately and increasing their feelings of unease.

"I also don't say I'm bullying you. Now, this is your last chance. This is the most serious thing I've said. Whether you listen or not depends on whether you can seize this last opportunity."

At this moment, Long Ge suddenly spoke. After saying these words, his eyes swept over everyone.

When they heard this, Long Ge's words made them all startled. Then they raised countless hopes, thinking maybe Long Ge had changed his mind and wouldn't hurt them?

But the old village head knew this was not so simple. How could a person like Long Ge do such a thankless thing?

So while other villagers showed relief, the old village head remained expressionless and listened carefully to Long Ge's words.

It was at this moment that Long Ge continued speaking. After hearing his words, everyone's faces changed again.

Everyone showed a heavy sense of unease because Long Ge said: "This time I don't restrict you. Whether you speak or not, whether you tell me where Su Nantian is or not."

After saying this, Long Ge paused slightly. His facial expression was full of infinite meaning.

All the villagers couldn't understand why Long Ge suddenly said this. But they heard that he wouldn't ask about Su Nantian's whereabouts anymore.

Chapter 822: The Death God Has Come

As long as they didn't have to reveal Su Nantian, it was okay.

Thinking of this, the villagers slightly relaxed and felt they had escaped a disaster.

Then Long Ge continued: "But every minute you delay, I will randomly shoot one villager. It could be you or him; it's just among you."

Long Ge's words were like the death god coming, killing them all.

At this moment, Long Ge finished speaking. When he said these words, everyone's hearts felt like they had been hit by a heavy hammer.

Several villagers couldn't accept this fact and took several steps back.

When AChuan heard Long Ge's words, he showed an excited expression and slapped his hands together. He was very happy: "Ah! Long Ge, you really have ideas. You know how to punish these dead villagers!"

After saying this, AChuan also excitedly supported Long Ge: "Long Ge! We should have done this long ago. If we hadn't acted, these villagers would think we were afraid of them! They all had their tails up high!"

After saying this, AChuan led the way and looked at the other villagers. At this moment, his expression had changed completely into one of bloodthirstiness and a full hunting atmosphere.

It seemed like these villagers were not people but the prey he had targeted.

AChuan quickly took out his phone and actively told Long Ge: "Long Ge, I've started timing for you. One person per minute!"

AChuan was very proactive; his face showed eagerness, as if he longed to kill them all.

But he didn't know that this sentence was like a death knell for the other villagers, as if they were about to die.

Everyone's hands and feet turned cold. They instinctively held their breath, and their heartbeats were extremely fast and uneasy.

"Long Ge, one minute!"

AChuan had found an interesting thing. He didn't care about these villagers' innocence or whether they were pitiable.

He actively started timing, and when the time was up, he immediately told Long Ge, as if it were a game rather than deciding the villagers' lives.

The villagers heard AChuan's excited voice and were startled. They didn't know what to do, all holding their breath and unable to make a sound.

At this moment, when Long Ge heard AChuan's words, he also cooperated and raised the gun. He held the gun to each villager, satisfied with their fearful expressions, then moved his gun left and right as if he really wanted to randomly select a victim.

"Previously, I shot this person and that one; they were both men. This time, let's try a different gender."

Long Ge and AChuan treated this as a game. His tone was light, and his attitude was casual. He didn't know how terrified these villagers were.

After hearing that Long Ge's target was women, the men didn't feel relieved but became even more nervous. They instinctively pushed all the women behind them, not wanting to be targeted by Long Ge.

Protecting women was their nature. Moreover, these were people they had known for a long time. How could they watch Long Ge harm them?

"Hey, are you trying to break the game rules?"

AChuan saw these villagers' actions and thought they were cheating. He immediately started to complain and threatened them: "Long Ge, don't waste time. Since they don't speak, we should just kill them all. I don't believe Su Nantian would still come out after hearing this noise!"

At this moment, AChuan's patience was almost used up. He became impatient and urged Long Ge to act.

At first, some villagers had acted, but when Chen Xiaoling saw other women trembling and feared she would become Long Ge's next target, she stood up and stepped in front of the villagers.

Faced with these ruthless people, Chen Xiaoling seemed to feel no fear and had no expression of panic. She fearlessly lifted her chin, looking at these people and said: "Shoot!"

Three simple words were spoken powerfully by Chen Xiaoling.

She knew these people had no humanity, and talking to them was a waste of time. It would be better to delay for a while to save these villagers.

"Did you say to kill women? Then start with me."

Chen Xiaoling said this sentence again in a cold tone. Her expression was solemn and serious, with no intention of joking.

This afternoon, she had been surrounded by Ahao and some hooligans. If Su Nantian hadn't arrived in time to save her, she would have been bullied by them.

Chen Xiaoling was also familiar with her own personality. Once she was bullied, she would definitely not survive in this world.

Since her life had been saved by Su Nantian, she would repay it with one life. There was nothing to worry about.

Chen Xiaoling's brother, Chen Xiaolin, had been the first person shot. He was now weak and lying on the ground.

Hearing her brother's voice, and seeing her sister fearlessly standing in front of these villagers, Chen Xiaolin's face changed immediately. He had wanted to stop Chen Xiaoling from doing these dangerous things.

But after thinking, he gradually swallowed his advice and said to Chen Xiaoling: "Sister, I am proud of you!"

His sister had truly grown up and become very brave.

After Chen Xiaoling stood out, other villagers also had a new idea. They seemed to feel that their previous actions were too cowardly, and although Su Nantian was not a villager but also Uncle Wang's relative and had helped them so much, they still only cared about themselves.

After thinking clearly, those women who had been behind the men also slowly stepped forward. Each of them had a neutral expression, and their aura was very powerful.

They were now completely fearless. They did not fear Long Ge or his weapons. These people had already thought clearly: it was no big deal to lose a life.

"You lowly people!"

AChuan had originally thought he would see them all beg for mercy. He never expected these villagers to be so stubborn and not fear death, standing in front of them as if they were truly fearless.

Especially seeing that the person standing at the front was Chen Xiaoling, who had a more determined gaze after this, AChuan felt even more angry.

It seemed they were not as good as these women. At this moment, Long Ge was also angered by their actions because he and AChuan had the same thoughts.

He believed these villagers would beg for mercy, constantly pleading with him to let them go.

Long Ge had thought that if these villagers begged for mercy and quickly revealed Su Nantian's whereabouts, he would not kill them.

He didn't want to make this matter too big, but he never expected these villagers to be so stubborn and not fear him at all.

Thinking of this, AChuan and Long Ge's expressions were both very grim. Their faces were as black as coal.

"Good! So you have backbone, huh?"

At this moment, Long Ge's voice was filled with anger and was very cold. He spoke angrily and then stared at these people.

The villagers heard Long Ge's voice but showed no fear. They stood tall and did not fear him.

"Good! Wanting to die is not difficult. I'll satisfy you!"

Long Ge was angered by their attitude. He had thought that if he threatened them, they would beg for mercy and kneel down to reveal Su Nantian's whereabouts. But instead, their courage was ignited.

Each of them showed no fear and seemed to disregard life and death.

After thinking about this, Long Ge felt even more angry. He pulled the trigger to kill Chen Xiaoling and satisfy her dedication.

Chen Xiaoling had never expected Long Ge to let her go. But when she saw them raise the gun and aim at her head, Chen Xiaoling still felt some fear.

Her body started to tremble slightly, and her eyes automatically closed, preparing to accept her death.

"Bang!"

The gun shot rang out immediately, startling countless birds in the forest.

But Chen Xiaoling's expected pain did not appear. There was no bloody scene either. Everyone immediately froze, unable to believe it.

"Never mind, killing you is not worth it."

It turned out that Long Ge had changed his mind. He aimed at the dirt in front of Chen Xiaoling and shot, causing countless stones to fly up but not hitting Chen Xiaoling.

After escaping this danger and being scared by death, Chen Xiaoling could not hold back her trembling legs and fell to the ground.

After all, she was just a girl in her early twenties. She had not seen many big scenes before. She had already used all her courage, and now seeing that she was not hit, she did not feel relieved but felt even more fear.

If Long Ge shot a second time, Chen Xiaoling did not know if she could still be so brave.

The villagers saw that Chen Xiaoling was alive and immediately sighed in relief. They kept thanking her, although they knew Long Ge would not easily let them go. But watching Chen Xiaoling die in front of them, they felt extremely fearful.

Thankfully, thankfully, Chen Xiaoling was not harmed.

"What do you mean by this, Long Ge?"

AChuan had already prepared to open fire. But seeing that Long Ge changed his mind and did not kill Chen Xiaoling, he was confused and turned to look at Long Ge. He also asked in confusion.

This shouldn't be the case. He had known Long Ge for many years and never thought he was a man who pitied women.

Although Chen Xiaoling's appearance in these mountain villages was quite good, compared to the many beauties Long Ge had seen with Hongye, there were over a thousand.

At most, he felt some initial surprise but quickly calmed down.

Moreover, they had been angered by Chen Xiaoling's impoliteness and had no time to appreciate her appearance.

So seeing Long Ge change his mind at the most critical moment and not kill Chen Xiaoling, AChuan naturally felt confused and did not understand the reason for Long Ge's change of mind.

"Why did you let her go, Long Ge?"

AChuan asked again with dissatisfaction. His face was full of confusion and some resentment towards Long Ge.

"Ah, you think I would let them go?"

After hearing AChuan's words, Long Ge sneered and then coldly looked at Chen Xiaoling.

"Think you're lucky!"

He quickly said the second half of his sentence and carried full contempt, with no mercy at all.

"What did you mean by that, Long Ge?"

After hearing Long Ge's words, AChuan furrowed his brows again and was still confused about what Long Ge was up to.

"I thought of a more interesting way."

At this moment, Long Ge continued speaking. His eyes were deep and his voice had a meaning.

"Interesting way?"
