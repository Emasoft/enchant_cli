The moment when Qian Fachen struck Li Xia was witnessed by all. Liu Yang let out a few exasperated sighs, and murmurs rippled through the audience.

Even the principal on the main stage looked unwell.
This school had always valued strength above all else, but Qian Fachen's act of beating and bullying those around him had never occurred during a match, let alone in front of the principal.

The principal on the main stage snorted coldly and muttered, "Which class's student is so arrogant? It's time to deal with them properly. If I punish this kid, it'll also be a favor to Su Nantian."

The referee gave them half a minute to calm down. After that, the whistle blew again. This time, Su Nantian's team served. The ball was naturally passed to Su Nantian, but he then handed it to Song Jin, saying, "You serve. Wherever you want to hit, just let out your anger."

Song Jin felt a surge of emotion in his chest, his nose tinged with acidity. The small boy wearing glasses held a volleyball as big as his head and stood at the serving position. Song Jin's serve made Qian Fachen sneer, more determined than ever to win this ball.

Song Jin bent his knees and prepared to jump. His small frame had surprising power, even impressing Su Nantian.

Song Jin leapt into the air and hurled the volleyball directly at Qian Fachen's face.

As the ball approached his face, Qian Fachen took a few steps back in fear and collided with his teammates who had rushed forward to catch it. Qian Fachen's team immediately fell into chaos, but with numbers on their side, they managed to return the ball just barely.

The High brothers leapt up and combined their strength to send the volleyball back across. This time, Su Nantian merely moved lazily a few steps, watching the ball's trajectory without making a move.

Without Su Nantian's formidable strength, both teams now faced off one-on-one.

The volleyball was passed back and forth for dozens of rounds, and the students from Class One were already panting heavily. Seeing this, Su Nantian was about to end the round when Song Jin suddenly jumped high again and sent the ball back. Because of the previous exchange, Qian Fachen's team had gathered near the net, leaving no one guarding the back.

Song Jin seized this opportunity and hurled the ball directly at Qian Fachen's rear.

Chapter 212: Conspiracy

Song Jin’s shot drew gasps from the entire crowd, with screams echoing throughout the stadium.
Su Nantian had not expected Song Jin’s frail body to suddenly display such explosive power.

Song Jin landed steadily on the ground, breathing heavily and clutching his hips to catch his breath.
Opposite him, Qian Fachen's group glared at Song Jin with hatred, wishing to pounce and beat him senseless.
But due to Su Nantian's strength, Qian Fachen did not act immediately; the match was still ongoing.
Yet they had already marked this grudge in their hearts, vowing to settle it later.

The referee on the stands blew his whistle and turned over the board to 2-0. At this moment, students from Class Two stopped waving their flags and some even discreetly began to leave.

Li Xia, watching the chaos in his class's seats, hurried over to Qian Fachen and whispered, "What should we do? Several of our class's big shots have already left."

Qian Fachen clenched his fists, his anger evident. He had started this match deliberately to make his class stand out among the new students, but also to win over some influential classmates.
Now, due to the volleyball results, these classmates were leaving one by one. Qian Fachen knew it would be impossible to retain them now.
But at the moment, he had underestimated Su Nantian's strength. Even this weak-looking Song Jin had won a point! Qian Fachen glanced at Li Xia, who looked worried, and growled, "No matter what method you use, don't let me see Song Jin in the next match!"

Whether Qian Fachen was blinded by anger or truly didn't care, Li Xia knew that when Qian Fachen gave an order in his anger, it had to be fulfilled. Otherwise, he would suffer.

Without hesitation, Li Xia nodded in agreement, even though the task was difficult; he would think of any way to complete it.

After two volleyball matches, there was a break in the game.
The referee announced the break at the center of the court, and both teams immediately withdrew to rest. One team was jubilant, while the other was gloomy.

After returning to the rest room, Qian Fachen's team dared not speak loudly; they only whispered among themselves about the morning match. It was obvious that Qian Fachen's mood was terrible, and no one was foolish enough to provoke him.

Li Xia was among them but had to rely on Qian Fachen, so he forced himself to approach Qian Fachen and said, "Brother, don't be too angry. I'll do as you said."

Qian Fachen's eyes were filled with cruelty. Upon hearing this, he looked up at Li Xia and patted his shoulder, saying, "If you mess this up again, do you know what the consequences will be?"

Li Xia's legs trembled; the hand on his shoulder felt as heavy as a thousand catties, suffocating him. But he forced out a pale smile and said, "You can rest assured; I won't neglect it."

Qian Fachen finally smiled slightly, his cruelty somewhat subdued. He patted Li Xia's face again, and Li Xia turned pale once more before nodding and leaving quickly.

No one in the rest room knew what Qian Fachen had discussed with Li Xia, but seeing that Qian Fachen's expression was no longer so angry, everyone resumed their chatter.

Qian Fachen was disturbed by the noise in the rest room and stood up, kicking a chair with his foot. The chair flew half a meter before crashing to the ground with a loud thud, silencing the noise instantly.

Qian Fachen lifted his chin and looked at the people in the rest room with disdain, saying, "After such a poor performance, why didn't you mention your terrible skills when you volunteered to join me?"

A collective gasp echoed through the room, and someone quickly whispered, "We didn't dare to deceive you."
Others also nodded in agreement, fearing Qian Fachen would take it out on them.

Qian Fachen sneered and watched as they all assured him, his mind still calm.
Thinking of Su Nantian's embarrassment after losing the match, he felt a little better.

"From now on, fight well for me. If you perform as poorly as today, both you and Li Xia won't escape." With that, Qian Fachen turned back to his seat, rubbing his hair and falling into deep thought again.

Meanwhile, in another rest room, the atmosphere was jubilant. The High brothers lifted Song Jin and bounced him before setting him down gently. Song Jin's face still bore a shy redness, and he waved his hands awkwardly.

Liu Yang laughed and teased, "Hey, I never thought you had such jumping ability. That high jump really shows your hidden talent."

Song Jin's face turned redder, and after a few struggles, he said, "What are you talking about? I just tapped into my potential!"

He Tao found this intriguing and asked, "Potential? What kind of potential?"

Song Jin bit his lip and chuckled awkwardly, saying, "I just wanted to end it quickly. I saw the ball and jumped immediately."

This left everyone confused, and Gao Gaoyi asked, "What's so stimulating? We all wanted to end it quickly but didn't jump as high as you."

"Ah!" Song Jin stomped his foot and said, "It's because I held it in..."

After a brief silence, the rest room erupted into laughter. Even Su Nantian couldn't help but show a slight smile.

Gao Gaoyi laughed until he could barely stop, then pushed Song Jin out while saying, "Why aren't you going to the toilet now? Did you wet your pants?"

Gao Gaoyi looked curious and pretended to bend down to check Song Jin's pants. Song Jin turned red and took a step back, clutching his waistband.

"It's because I was startled by my own ball; it made me hold it back, and now I can't go."

As soon as he said this, Song Jin tightened his grip on his waistband, and his facial muscles twitched unnaturally. "No good... I need to go again! I'll be right back!"

Song Jin said this and rushed out immediately. Su Nantian laughed a little, then suddenly thought of something and said to He Tao, "Hurry up and go with him."

Chapter 213: Ambush

He Tao's smile hadn't faded yet; he was still helping Liu Yang sit down. Upon hearing Su Nantian's call, He Tao blinked and laughed, "Senior Tian, you're too worried about Song Jin. He can jump so high; he won't fall into the toilet."

After saying this, He Tao and Liu Yang laughed again. Liu Yang added, "Even if he fell in, Song Jin would jump out immediately."

This time, even the High brothers couldn't hold back their laughter.

Su Nantian sighed inwardly; these people were still naive. The enemy had used a trick, and since it hadn't succeeded yet, they definitely wouldn't give up.
Moreover, Song Jin had just shown astonishing strength; he would surely find another opportunity to strike.
And his target was too obvious; if the enemy saw him, they wouldn't dare to act.

"I sent you out with Song Jin because I suspect Qian Fachen will attack him. If you don't go now, it'll be too late." Su Nantian said calmly.

Upon hearing this, He Tao's smile immediately froze on his face.
"I'm going!" He cursed under his breath and rushed out. Su Nantian saw Liu Yang and the High brothers also wanted to go, so he stopped them and said, "Don't get excited. Qian Fachen won't let too many people go after Song Jin. He Tao going is enough. If you all go, the target will be too big, and Qian Fachen might not attack Song Jin at this moment." He paused: "In short, if you don't want to cause trouble, don't go."

Liu Yang's face turned embarrassed, and he quickly sat back down with the High brothers.

Meanwhile, Song Jin rushed to the restroom, unzipped his pants, and relieved himself comfortably. He even stretched lazily.

Song Jin's face was full of satisfaction, and he quickly zipped up his pants to return to his friends.

But as Song Jin turned around, his smile froze on his face—he saw Li Xia at the door.

At this moment, the restroom was empty except for Song Jin and Li Xia. Song Jin suspected that Li Xia had come specifically to find him.

So he lowered his head and prepared to pass by Li Xia.
But just as he approached the door,
Li Xia suddenly shut and locked the restroom door. At this point, even Song Jin, who was not very bright, realized the situation was unfavorable.

Song Jin nervously adjusted his glasses and took a few steps back. Li Xia, seeing Song Jin's tense expression, felt some satisfaction.

Li Xia came from a wealthy family, but his background was not as good as Qian Fachen's. Li Xia's father had sent him to Qian Fachen's side since high school, asking Li Xia to take good care of Qian Fachen.
In the upper class, such situations were common; many aristocratic families would send a child to another family for cooperation. This was known as "staying over for two days."

Li Xia had been there since university. During this time, he often secretly contacted his family to ask when he would return, but Li Xia's father had benefited from the cooperation with Qian Fachen and only evaded him for years. Li Xia's self-esteem had been eroded by Qian Fachen over time.

If Qian Fachen was dark-hearted, Li Xia was a twisted personality.
That's why he would risk everything to complete Qian Fachen's order; otherwise, after returning to the Qian family... Li Xia shivered and tightened his grip on the baseball bat behind him.

After taking a few steps back, Song Jin still didn't see Li Xia approaching, so he cautiously asked, "What do you mean?"

Li Xia kept one hand behind his back gripping the baseball bat and waved the other hand casually, saying, "What do I mean? I just came to congratulate you. Your performance today was excellent."

His smile was fake, like wearing a mask. Song Jin had never met someone like this before and felt his heart pounding like a drum. He mustered courage and asked, "Why did you lock the door?"

The locked restroom door stood silently. No one knocked from outside, which made Song Jin even more nervous. Li Xia also looked back at the door without expression and said, "Because I'm afraid you'll run away."

At this moment, Li Xia's eyes were filled with coldness and cruelty. Song Jin's forehead broke out in sweat, and he glanced around the environment. He didn't know if he could escape successfully, so he felt worried.

Li Xia didn't notice Song Jin's inner thoughts but finally prepared to act. The hand holding the baseball bat came out from behind.

Song Jin stared at the iron baseball bat in Li Xia's hand and took a nervous breath.
"Why?" Song Jin asked.

"Why?" Li Xia repeated, laughing, "That's something you should ask yourself. Why did you jump to hit that ball? And why didn't you step on that nail at the beginning?"

Song Jin's eyes widened in surprise, trembling as he asked, "You? You want to hurt me?"

Li Xia blinked and touched the baseball bat in his hand, speaking like a heartless puppet: "I don't want to hurt you, but I have to."

He lowered his hand and the heavy head of the baseball bat landed on the ground with a loud thud. Li Xia dragged the baseball bat forward step by step, but his face showed no emotion at all.

Song Jin cowered against the wall near the window, but this behavior was just meaningless resistance in Li Xia's eyes.

Song Jin looked at Li Xia approaching and quickly pressed himself against the wall. He glanced at the window, which was only as high as his chest, and felt anxious.
But in a flash of thought, Song Jin pointed at Li Xia's back with his trembling finger and said awkwardly, "Qian Fachen!"

Hearing Qian Fachen's name, Li Xia instinctively turned around but saw no one. When he turned back, Song Jin was already climbing the window.

Li Xia let out a light laugh and walked over, raising his iron bat to strike Song Jin's小腿.

This ambush made Song Jin fall from the window with a scream of pain that pierced the sky, causing Li Xia's eardrums to throb painfully and also silencing the noise outside the restroom.

That was Song Jin's voice, and He Tao panicked and rushed over to push the restroom door. But it was already locked. He Tao panted heavily, and Song Jin's painful screams echoed from inside the restroom.

Chapter 214: Escape

He Tao was furious and slammed his arms against the restroom door.
"Help!" Song Jin's voice echoed from inside.
But soon, it disappeared.

He Tao didn't care about his life and kept slamming the door with all his strength.
His arms soon turned purple from the impact.

Boom.

A loud thud.

The restroom door was broken open by He Tao's brute force.
He stumbled into the restroom and got up, only to see Song Jin rolling on the ground with his left leg, groaning silently. The attacker had already disappeared.

Escaped?
He Tao's forehead broke out in cold sweat and quickly approached Song Jin, anxiously asking, "What happened? What's wrong with you? Where's the person who hit you?"

Song Jin was in so much pain he couldn't think straight, but with the last bit of his mind, he stammered, "Li Xia... Li Xia hit me. He ran away..."

Song Jin took deep breaths, and the pain had made his forehead covered in cold sweat. He struggled to point at the now-open window.

He Tao was furious and helped Song Jin up, leaning him against the wall. Then he looked out of the window.

Unexpectedly, He Tao saw no one, only a half-footprint on the window.

Looking at Song Jin beside him, He Tao roared.
He had rushed out so quickly that he didn't bring his phone. Now, the priority was to take Song Jin back to the rest room.

Bending down, he reached out to lift Song Jin.
As soon as he touched him, Song Jin gasped sharply and looked like he was about to faint.

He Tao realized he had accidentally touched the wound.
He quickly pulled his hand back and thought of another way to carry him.

"Maybe I should carry you," He Tao said, bending down and squatting in front of Song Jin.

Song Jin sniffed, not sure if it was from pain or sand in his eyes.

Song Jin placed his hand on He Tao's shoulder and clung tightly to it. Seeing that Song Jin was ready, He Tao slowly stood up, placing his hand under Song Jin's thighs to support his bottom. This time, he didn't touch the wound. He Tao felt a sense of relief and quickly carried Song Jin to the rest room.

After He Tao carried Song Jin back to the rest room, everyone was shocked by the scene. Even Su Nantian stood up from his seat.

"Who did it?" Su Nantian frowned and asked.

"Who else could it be!" He Tao, with Liu Yang and the High brothers' help, gently placed Song Jin on a makeshift bed made of seats. He gritted his teeth and said, "Class Two isn't worth anything. To win, they sent Li Xia to attack Song Jin like this!"

"Ah?" The three of them gasped. Su Nantian frowned slightly. He had vaguely noticed Qian Fachen's expression when he came down, but hadn't expected him to actually send Li Xia to ambush Song Jin.

Now that He Tao had returned with Song Jin, it was clear Li Xia had already escaped. But Su Nantian guessed that Li Xia would first report the incident to Qian Fachen. If someone mentioned there were third parties, Qian Fachen would definitely have Li Xia continue playing. After all, Qian Fachen had been too clever before; he wouldn't play the old "there's no silver here" trick again.

Su Nantian had this in his heart and vowed to make Qian Fachen regret it.

Su Nantian looked at Song Jin lying there, his forehead covered in sweat, but still couldn't stop the pain. The sound of Song Jin's suppressed pain made Su Nantian and his group feel uneasy.

"They've already called an ambulance. Should we report it?" Gao Gaoyi put his phone back in his pocket and said, "No! Don't report it..."

Su Nantian was confused and asked, "Why not report it?"

Song Jin blinked and slowly lowered his hand. After a pause, he said, "My family background isn't as good as yours. I only got into this university through my studies. Last year, I passed the entrance exam but couldn't afford the fees, so I retaken it. This year, I finally got in. I..."

"I don't want to cause trouble or get involved with people I can't handle. Let's just let this go; I don't want my parents to worry about me anymore."

Everyone was hearing Song Jin's background for the first time, and they were surprised and sympathetic. But Su Nantian didn't think so; instead, he patted Song Jin's shoulder and said confidently, "Your wisdom and responsibility are things many people lack. In your case, you're much wealthier than them."

Song Jin's pale face smiled slightly. Everyone felt as if someone had punched them in the chest.

"Li Xia really isn't worth anything!" Liu Yang suddenly shouted, startling He Tao. Liu Yang put down the damp towel and pointed at Song Jin's shoulder: "Look, such a big footprint. How could he hit someone and then kick them!"

Song Jin felt embarrassed and said, "No, it's not a kick... It was He Tao knocking on the door from outside. I wanted to escape but couldn't climb up the window..."

"Did he kick you?!" Liu Yang shouted.

Song Jin frowned and nodded weakly, which made even Su Nantian unable to sit still. His anger was growing gradually.

"Don't worry, I've checked your injury," Su Nantian said, removing his hands from Song Jin's injured leg and adding, "It's not broken; it's just a minor fracture. The worse part is the external injury. Within moments, the muscle hit will swell and hurt more than now."

Song Jin heard it wasn't broken and nodded slightly, saying, "It's a blessing in disguise. If it were broken, it would cost more money."

Su Nantian understood what Song Jin was worried about and comforted him, "Don't worry. The cost of seeing a doctor and the mental distress will be compensated. We'll get it back for you. You won't have to spend a penny."

For some reason, Song Jin looked at this group of people. They had only met that morning but had gone through so much and gained such good friendship, which made Song Jin feel it was worth every beat.

But he didn't dare say that because he knew if he did, these friends would definitely beat him up.

"But now..." Song Jin thought of another problem and looked at Su Nantian worriedly, asking, "Now that I'm injured, what about the match? We don't have a libero. If I leave now, we'll be even fewer and barely meet the required number of players. Can we still continue the match?"

Song Jin's question was also on everyone's mind.

Chapter 215: The Match Continues

Everyone in the rest room turned their pleading eyes to Su Nantian. Su Nantian smiled and said, "Don't worry about it; I can solve it."

Upon hearing this, Song Jin sighed in relief and said, "Then I can rest assured to recover." The next second, he touched his wound again and gasped.

Liu Yang couldn't help but poke Song Jin's forehead and said, "Stop talking; just rest until the ambulance comes."

Song Jin touched his forehead and smiled weakly, nodding.

"Gaoyi," Su Nantian called out, "go get Cao Yun and the principal."

"Ah?" Gaoyi was stunned. He touched his nose with his index finger and said, "Me? Going to get Cao Yun is fine, but going to get the principal? What's my face worth?" Gaoyi frowned and rubbed his hands.

"Just tell the principal that Su Nantian is looking for him, and he'll come with you," Su Nantian said again. "Hurry up."

Su Nantian's tone was impossible to refuse. Even if he knew the principal might not come, Gaoyi still gritted his teeth and rushed out.

"Senior Tian, what can the principal do?" Gao Gaoyi asked after his brother had rushed out.

Su Nantian looked at him and didn't explain, just gazed at Song Jin who was already drowsy.

He reached out and touched Song Jin's leg, lifting his pants to see the swelling on his leg. It was already bruised and darkened with blood.

Su Nantian frowned, placing his large hand on Song Jin's wound. On the surface, it seemed like he was comforting Song Jin, but in reality, Su Nantian was using his energy to gradually ease Song Jin's pain.

If he had brought his silver needles, this small injury would have been resolved in an instant. But with the nourishment of his energy, it would heal quickly without any lasting effects.

Not long after, the principal and Cao Yun arrived panting. Everyone was surprised to see how concerned the principal was about this incident.

Cao Yun entered the rest room and saw Song Jin lying there, her heart jumping. She rushed over and asked, "What happened to Song Jin?"

He Tao briefly explained what had happened. Cao Yun's expression gradually turned angry.

"It's too much! Doing something like this? He's not even human!" Cao Yun cursed and stamped her foot.

Su Nantian looked at the principal who was frowning, he had intentionally let He Tao recount the entire incident. Su Nantian wanted to see how the principal would handle it.

"Principal," Su Nantian said, "this is what happened. What do you think?"

The principal heard Su Nantian call him and quickly stepped forward to stand beside Song Jin, sighing, "Ah, this good young man was beaten like this."

Su Nantian raised an eyebrow and continued, "So what do you think the culprit should be punished for?"

"This..." The principal's expression was awkward. "You see, there's no surveillance in the restroom. This incident is hard to prove without evidence. Also, you know how much money the Qian family has invested in the school recently..." The principal stammered and lowered his head.

Everyone was angry, clenching their fists, but Su Nantian remained calm as if he had expected it.

"It's reasonable, but since the victim is us, you know my temperament." Su Nantian stood up and looked at the principal. The unintentional pressure he exuded made the principal want to step back.

Su Nantian continued, "I'm clear about right and wrong. You can ignore this matter, but it will be in my hands from now on. Then you'll know how to behave."

Su Nantian's words were neither harsh nor gentle, like a calm narrative but also like a sharp knife at the principal's neck. The people in the rest room were surprised that Su Nantian could speak to the principal like this, and they looked at him with admiration.

"Ah, I know, I know," the principal smiled fawningly and touched his neck, which felt cold.

"There's another thing," Su Nantian said again.
"What is it..." The principal swallowed nervously, fearing he had angered Su Nantian and would be punished by the Lin family or Gao family.

"Right now, our volleyball team is short one person. The match can't proceed normally. But I believe that since there's a reason, if we don't mind being short one person to play against them, the school would also not mind." Su Nantian said coldly.

The principal immediately waved his hands and explained, "No problem, no problem. It's a small matter. I'll go to the podium before the match starts and explain it, and I'll also remove one person from their team to give you a chance!" The principal feigned righteousness and seemed quite noble.

Su Nantian was unimpressed and said, "It's none of your business now. Go."

As soon as he spoke, the principal rushed out immediately. The others were amazed.

Cao Yun also sighed absentmindedly, "The principal's speed is amazing."

A second later, after everyone had recovered, they looked at Su Nantian with surprise and hope in their eyes.

"Senior Tian, did I hear correctly? We're short one person but can still continue the match?" Gao Gaoyi asked uncertainly.

"Why not," Su Nantian said, "By the way, Cao Yun."

Cao Yun immediately stood by Su Nantian's side and said with suppressed excitement, "You called me?"

"Song Jin is injured now. They've already called an ambulance. Later, you'll accompany him to the hospital and make sure no one approaches him," Su Nantian instructed.

Although he couldn't be with Su Nantian, Cao Yun was happy to accept the command. She nodded immediately and said, "Okay, I'll accompany Song Jin and protect him well."

Su Nantian turned his attention back to Song Jin. Because Su Nantian had used a little energy to ease the pain, Song Jin was already falling asleep. He looked like he was sleeping soundly.

He Tao couldn't help but tease, "Strange, look at this person; he was in so much pain a moment ago, now he's already asleep. Listen closely, he even grinds his teeth."

Everyone was amused but only stifled their laughter.

At this moment, Su Nantian noticed He Tao's bruised arm and asked, "What happened to your arm?"

Everyone's attention turned to He Tao's arm. There was a palm-sized bruise on it, which looked quite terrifying.

Chapter 216: On the Field

He Tao felt embarrassed and quickly covered the bruise with his hand, laughing, "Hey, it's nothing. It was because Li Xia locked the door earlier, and I broke it open."

Suddenly thinking of breaking the door, He Tao's mouth twitched and said, "Now I have to pay for the toilet door."

Su Nantian laughed, "Don't worry; I'll make them pay for your injury. This money will hurt them."

Actually, the cost of a door was nothing for He Tao's family background. But hearing Su Nantian say he would get justice for them, his heart was grateful.

After a few minutes, the sound of an ambulance echoed outside the rest room. This sound had drawn many students' attention since it entered the school gate. Now, the ambulance outside was surrounded by curious students.

It seemed to be the same rescue team that had come on Shen Fei's day, rushing in with nurses wearing masks. They carried stretchers and emergency medical kits from the ambulance quickly and brought them into the rest room.

The students outside watched the ambulance and started gossiping, with various guesses flying around.

"Hey? Why is the ambulance coming to Su Nantian's rest room? Did someone get hurt?"

"Ah? Not really, I heard Su Nantian's team barely managed to gather five people and didn't have a libero. If someone got injured, would they still play?"

The outside world was noisy, but the people inside were anxiously waiting for the medical staff to perform temporary treatment on Song Jin.

A nurse wearing a mask completed an examination and bandaging for Song Jin, wiping the sweat from her forehead and said, "This young man is so tough; he didn't even wake up."

Su Nantian blinked twice and turned his gaze elsewhere without expression.

Three medical staff carried Song Jin onto the stretcher, and two of them had already left with it. Only the nurse who had just finished organizing remained to tidy up the remaining items. Her hands moved quickly and efficiently, tidying everything in a few steps.

Looking up from the emergency medical kit, the nurse was startled and said to Su Nantian in a low voice, "Hey? It's you again? You beat Shen Fei from your class before. Is it you again?"

Su Nantian's mouth twitched, but he said nothing.

Cao Yun quickly pulled the nurse and said, "No, no, it's not him. I'll go with you to the hospital to take care of the patient."

She said this and pulled the nurse out of the door. Before leaving, she gave Su Nantian a thumbs-up gesture.

Su Nantian rubbed his eyes and said to the group of boys who were stifling their laughter, "It's almost time to go on stage. Clean up quickly."

After a few minutes, Su Nantian's team and Qian Fachen's team stood face to face again.
Qian Fachen smiled, "What? You're short one person now? Did you run away at the last minute?"

Su Nantian remained expressionless, "He was ambushed and had to rest in the hospital."

Qian Fachen's eyes flashed with cruelty. The principal on the main stage turned on the microphone and spoke loudly, filling the playground with his voice.

"Earlier, a student from Class One was beaten while using the restroom and has now been sent to the hospital. Therefore, Su Nantian's team will be short one person. To ensure fairness, I'll also remove one person from Qian Fachen's team in Class Two. Although the numbers are both insufficient, fairness has been achieved."

He paused and continued, "As for Song Jin being beaten while using the restroom, it's due to the school's failure in supervision. Therefore, the school will compensate Song Jin with medical expenses and mental distress. Finally, to ensure the safety of all students, surveillance cameras will be installed outside the restroom without infringing on privacy!"

Although Qian Fachen and Li Xia weren't exposed, the fact that one person was removed from Qian Fachen's team had already made him very upset. It felt like he had kicked the bucket himself, and Qian Fachen glared at Li Xia. Li Xia was stunned.

"When you draw the person out later, go yourself. I didn't say it to you," Qian Fachen whispered in Li Xia's ear. Li Xia's eyes, which had been lowered, flickered with something strange, but he still nodded.

The principal on the main stage added, "As for the person drawn out, it will be decided by drawing lots."

Gao Jingjing carried a box of lot-drawing sticks and smiled as she approached Qian Fachen, saying, "Student, draw one."

Qian Fachen was stunned by Gao Jingjing's beauty and hesitated. But after she called him again, he reached into the stick box and fumbled around.
