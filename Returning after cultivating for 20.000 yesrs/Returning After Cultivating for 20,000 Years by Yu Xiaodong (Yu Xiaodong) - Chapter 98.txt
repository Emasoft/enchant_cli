"Thus, Su Nantian could only shake his head and said, 'No, I cannot approach the disguise. My current transformation is complicated. If I remove it in front of you, I might not be able to restore it properly. As a bodyguard of the Nangong family, I still need to return. If you want to verify, ask some questions. In any case, I cannot reveal my true identity now.'"

Su Nantian said this while looking at Wu You'er.

Although Wu You'er still had some doubts in his heart, he knew that here it was almost impossible for anyone to impersonate Su Nantian. He had been here for so long without any imposter appearing, yet he chose this moment—when he was about to secure the position of Wu family's heir—to impersonate Su Nantian. It simply didn't make sense.

But Wu You'er remained cautious and asked, "Then I'll ask you: what is my favorite ice cream flavor?"

Hearing this question, Su Nantian was truly at a loss. He had never seen Wu You'er eat ice cream, and when Wu You'er controlled his family's home, he had never bought this thing either.

After thinking for a long time, Su Nantian could only frown and say, "Can this question be changed?"

"Why? You can't answer it. So you're not Su Nantian, you're an imposter!" Wu You'er pointed at Su Nantian and said.

Su Nantian was truly exasperated. He himself was the real Su Nantian, where was there a fake? He didn't know what wind Wu You'er had caught that he asked such an issue he knew nothing about.

So Su Nantian could only sigh helplessly and said, "It's because I don't know. I don't know what flavor you like for ice cream, since after we met, you've never eaten this thing. Even at my home, they never bought it either. How can I answer? Ask another question, other questions I definitely can answer!"

After hearing Su Nantian say this, Wu You'er finally smiled and looked at Su Nantian with a happy expression before saying, "You are the real Su Nantian!"

Su Nantian heard this and was quite puzzled. He had not answered anything, yet she knew whether he was the real Su Nantian or not?

At this moment, Wu You'er explained his reasoning: "I deliberately asked this question. You're right, after we met, I've never eaten ice cream. So much less do I like any flavor. If you could answer it, that would be strange. Therefore, I believe you are the real Su Nantian."

"You really are a mischievous person. Just trust me." At this point, Su Nantian immediately changed his expression and said seriously: "Now, how is the Wu family treating you? Have they harmed you? I see that Wu Chuan wants to use you as a puppet to control the Wu family. What about your parents? Are they okay?"

Su Nantian knew he had limited time, so he wanted to ask all the questions he wanted at once.

Wu You'er was very happy when she saw Su Nantian, her face carrying a long-lost smile. But after hearing the questions Su Nantian asked, Wu You'er's expression darkened again. She said sorrowfully: "We haven't been subjected to any abuse, but I've only met my parents a few times. Wu Chuan used them as leverage to get me to obtain the position of heir, and he wants me to stay here for two years before transferring the inheritance to him."

Saying this, Wu You'er walked to the window and continued with a sorrowful expression: "I really don't understand what Wu Chuan's intention is. My parents and I have no desire to fight for the Wu family's things. If he wants it, let him take it. Since he insists on me getting the heir position for him, why wait two years? I could directly give it to him this time."

After hearing what Wu You'er said, Su Nantian roughly understood the current situation. He told Wu You'er: "Wu Chuan is doing this to be more legitimate. Although everyone knows that you are behind Wu Chuan, it's a secret that is not openly discussed. Therefore, Wu Chuan cannot immediately accept your transfer of the position when you obtain it. Otherwise, he would still be illegitimate. On the contrary, if you stay in the Wu family for two years and make some major mistakes under Wu Chuan's instructions, then Wu Chuan can legitimately accept your transfer of the family head position. Do you understand?"

After hearing what Su Nantian said, Wu You'er finally understood why Wu Chuan insisted on her leaving the Wu family after two years.

"But I definitely won't leave the Wu family after two years. My parents and I both want to leave as soon as possible. What should we do?" Wu You'er said this and looked at Su Nantian anxiously, not knowing what to do next. After all, Wu Tao and his wife were in Wu Chuan's hands. She could only comply with Wu Chuan's demands to ensure her parents' safety.

"Don't worry. I'm here now. I came here to find a chance to rescue you both. So you just continue doing what Wu Chuan asked of you. We should maintain contact. Have they cut off your communication with the outside world?"

At this point, Su Nantian suddenly asked because if Wu Chuan really wanted to fully control Wu You'er, he would have already cut off all her means of communication with the outside world.

Wu You'er nodded and said, "Yes. I have been cut off from external communication. The only thing is that I can have a video call with my parents once a week, and sometimes I can see them in person. However, I don't know where they are now, or whether they are even not in the Wu family house but under other industries owned by Wu Chuan."

After hearing this, Su Nantian frowned. In this case, it would be very difficult for him to communicate with Wu You'er. Originally, Su Nantian wanted to take Wu You'er and Wu Tao's family away directly during this selection of the Wu family heir. But now it seems they are not in the same place. If he took Wu You'er away first, it would only raise suspicion. Therefore, he had to think of another way.

Chapter 481: Utterly Foolish

Su Nantian knew his previous plan had been completely overturned. He never expected Wu Chuan to have hidden Wu Tao's family, so he could not leave Wu You'er because if he took her away alone, it would put Wu Tao's family in danger. Therefore, he had to choose another method to solve this problem.

As Su Nantian was about to say something else, he saw the time on the wall clock. It was already late, and he had been out for a while, so Su Nantian could not stay here any longer. He must return soon.

Therefore, Su Nantian said to Wu You'er: "You'er, continue following Wu Chuan. I'll find a way. Originally, I wanted to take you away directly during this selection of the Wu family heir. But now that your parents are not with me, if I take you away, it would only put their situation in more danger. So I need to find another way. Don't be afraid, I will definitely rescue you both. Now I'm disguised in the Nangong family, so I have to return now. When I have time, I'll come find you again."

After hearing this, Wu You'er nodded quickly. He also knew that Su Nantian was using another identity now; if someone discovered it, it would be bad.

"Be careful when you go back. I'm waiting for your news." Wu You'er said this.

After hearing Wu You'er say this, Su Nantian nodded immediately and walked to the door but did not open it right away. Instead, he stood by the door listening to the sounds outside and confirmed that no one was around before turning back to Wu You'er and saying goodbye, then leaving.

When Su Nantian returned from Wu You'er's room to his own room, he had just reached the first corner when he found someone standing there. This startled Su Nantian greatly.

However, although his heart was racing wildly at that moment, he remained calm on the surface. He nodded to this person and continued walking towards his room as if nothing had happened.

As Su Nantian walked forward with a composed demeanor, he heard this person say: "Stop pretending. I saw you. You went to see Wu You'er. What does your Nangong family want?"

In fact, the person Su Nantian saw at the corner was none other than Wu Ruotian. And this Wu Ruotian, if Su Nantian was not mistaken, should also be a subordinate of Wu Chuan. Therefore, Su Nantian was startled; he had been discovered going to see Wu You'er, which would surely be reported to Wu Chuan. That would be a problem.

"Turn around and tell me what's going on!" Wu Ruotian, who usually looked weak, now spoke with a strong voice.

Su Nantian finally realized that since he was only a small bodyguard in Wu Ruotian's eyes, Wu Ruotian naturally looked down on him. At the same time, Su Nantian also felt that Wu Ruotian was somewhat unusual; he could recognize that Su Nantian was from the Nangong family, which was quite astonishing.

Su Nantian turned around and after observing Wu Ruotian, he said: "I didn't expect it would be you who called me. It's Wu Ruotian, sir. Hello."

Wu Ruotian was a bit surprised; he hadn't expected anyone to know his name. But he quickly said, "It's late at night. I don't know what your Nangong family is doing by going to see Wu You'er?"

Su Nantian smiled and said, "This matter is not for everyone to know. Some things can be said, some cannot. Now it's the stage of the heir competition. I think Wu Ruotian, you should think about how to get the position of heir. Excuse me, I have to leave now; my Nangong master is waiting for me back."

Su Nantian was forcing himself to stay calm, as if he were really sent out by Nangong Ping.

This Wu Ruotian was obviously stunned by Su Nantian's behavior. He frowned and wanted to say something but didn't speak out, so he smiled slightly and turned back towards his room.

But just after Su Nantian had taken a few steps, he heard Wu Ruotian suddenly speak again: "Stop! Come here. I have something to ask you."

Su Nantian cursed in his heart, but on the surface he had no choice but to smile and walk back. He said: "I don't know what Wu Ruotian, sir, has to say. I need to return and report to my Nangong master now. Please hurry."

Wu Ruotian looked around mysteriously and, after confirming no one was around, whispered to Su Nantian: "I also went to see Master Nangong before. I want to know what Master Nangong's thoughts are on the condition I proposed?"

After saying this, Wu Ruotian looked expectantly at Su Nantian, waiting for his answer.

After hearing this question, Su Nantian couldn't help but want to laugh, but he finally restrained himself. This Wu Ruotian really had no sense at all; he didn't know that the false and grandiose condition he proposed was discarded by Nangong Ping and his sister, Nan Gong Yu Yan, from the beginning.

"I suggest you propose more practical conditions next time. Although your condition is indeed tempting, it's also vague and impractical. Do you understand my meaning?" Su Nantian didn't say it directly, but this sentence had already told Wu Ruotian that his previous condition would not be believed at all, so there was no desire for cooperation.

Although Wu Ruotian was foolish, he was still a disciple cultivated by a big family. Therefore, he could understand the meaning of Su Nantian's words. He frowned and said: "But this is the most tempting condition I thought of. And if I really become the head of the Wu family..."

After saying this, Wu Ruotian looked around again before carefully saying: "If I become the head of the family, I really will fulfill this condition."

Su Nantian looked at Wu Ruotian's foolishness and finally understood why Wu Chuan had chosen Wu Ruotian to be another puppet. Because Wu Ruotian was truly foolish, so foolish it was unbearable.

"These things are beyond our control as bodyguards. So everything still depends on your master. Alright, it's too late now; I must return immediately and can't chat with you anymore. Goodbye."

After saying this, Su Nantian quickly left. This time if Wu Ruotian called him again, he would not turn back. He had already wasted a long time here and it was completely useless.

Chapter 482: Final Decision

This time, Wu Ruotian did not stop Su Nantian, allowing him to return safely to his room. Fortunately, no one discovered he had left, so the night's actions were all safe.

That night Su Nantian finally connected with Wu You'er and also understood the current situation of Wu You'er within the Wu family. He also knew that Wu Tao's parents were not with Wu You'er now; they were like hostages, used as leverage by Wu Chuan to control Wu You'er.

Therefore, Su Nantian's previous plan was completely overturned. He had previously thought he could directly take Wu You'er and Wu Tao's family away during this selection of the Wu family heir. But now it seemed he had been too naive; Wu Chuan probably had already anticipated this and separated Wu You'er and Wu Tao's family.

In that case, Su Nantian decided to stay put for now because Wu Chuan was not daring to harm Wu You'er. He still needed Wu You'er to stay in the Wu family for two years as his puppet. Therefore, before that, Wu You'er and Wu Tao's parents were probably not in any danger.

Now Su Nantian had to consider how to find an opportunity to rescue both sides at the same time.

But fortunately, Su Nantian still had a fixed safe identity: a bodyguard of the Nangong family. And now he was favored by Nangong Ping, so he must make good use of this. It would be best to facilitate cooperation between the Nangong family and the Wu family, so that he could take this opportunity to go to the Wu family more easily and help Wu You'er and Wu Tao's family escape.

"Never mind, I need to plan from scratch again," Su Nantian shook his head and said this. Then he went to bed, and the next day was the final day of the Wu family heir competition. It would be the day to decide the result, and he must carefully observe the current situation of the Wu family so that it would help him rescue Wu You'er and Wu Tao's family later.

The next morning, as soon as the alarm clock rang, Su Nantian immediately washed up and got dressed before going to Nangong Ping's room. There was no choice but for him to be the bodyguard of Nangong Ping now.

Nangong Ping was悠闲ly having breakfast tea on the sofa as usual. When he saw Su Nantian coming, he was in a good mood and greeted him.

Su Nantian naturally knew why Nangong Ping was so happy today. Because they only needed to complete the final process and then return to the Nangong family. Ending this business and returning home made Nangong Ping happy.

At that moment, the door was knocked. Su Nantian went to the door and saw it was Nangong Yuyan, so he immediately let her in.

Nangong Yuyan hadn't expected that the person who opened the door was Su Nantian. Usually, this job was done by Wang Meng, so she was a bit unaccustomed to it.

Su Nantian naturally didn't know what Nangong Yuyan was thinking inside, but he saw her looking at him with this kind of gaze and was confused about whether he had offended her.

However, Nangong Yuyan didn't say anything. She directly walked in and went to sit by Nangong Ping, then took up her breakfast tea and drank it.

"How is it? Have you decided?" Nangong Yuyan took a sip of tea and looked satisfied before saying this.

Nangong Ping nodded in response: "Although Wu Yu's conditions were better than Wu Chuan's, for us it was real benefits. I think Wu Yu can't become the heir; he would be directly eliminated by Wu Chuan within the family. No matter how much he promises, if we can't get it in the end, it's all for nothing. Moreover, Wu Yu's promises weren't as tempting as Wu Chuan's, just slightly better than Wu Chuan's. This way there was no advantage at all. We still support Wu Chuan."

Nangong Ping thought through this clearly, just like Su Nantian. And now Su Nantian also wanted Wu Chuan to win, because only then would Wu You'er's safety be guaranteed. If Wu Chuan didn't win, then Wu You'er and Wu Tao's family would be unknown what kind of treatment they would receive.

More importantly, Su Nantian still didn't fully understand the internal divisions of these forces in the capital. There were many obstacles to rescue now, so it was better for Wu Chuan to achieve his goal. Then the Nangong family and Wu family would have a long-term cooperative relationship, and Su Nantian could meet Wu You'er more often, making it easier to rescue her.

Nangong Yuyan and Nangong Ping had the same idea, so the two siblings immediately agreed. They decided to vote for Wu Chuan today.

"Should we inform Huang family?" Nangong Ping suddenly remembered. The Huang family naturally had to follow them, so since they had decided, it was necessary to inform them.

Nangong Yuyan shook her head and said: "No need. They will send someone to ask us if they want to follow our steps. Even if they don't ask, according to what Father said before, they would vote with us during the voting. If we send people over now, it would look like we are begging them, which is unnecessary. Just keep a high posture. Although there are no longer emperors and ministers, the relationship and rules between our two families cannot be changed."

When Nangong Yuyan said this, her expression was extremely arrogant. It could be seen that she had been surrounded by this concept since childhood, believing it was natural for the Huang family to submit to the Nangong family.

In fact, the more this way, the more it would cause a contrast. Moreover, Su Nantian had met these two people from the Huang family before; he thought they actually looked more capable than Nangong Ping.

But the Huang family was definitely still relying on the Nangong family to accumulate their strength. This was the best choice for them. Once there were any storms outside, they could take advantage of Nangong family's front to protect themselves. Once their strength was strong enough, they could break away from the Nangong family in one move.

However, at this moment, the door was knocked again. Su Nantian went to the door again and saw it was a person from the Wu family, so he directly opened the door.

"Hello. Our Wu family's heir selection preliminary process has basically ended. So we will hold a grand banquet in the ballroom tonight. Please be sure to attend on time. This is the invitation. Wishing you a pleasant day." After saying this, the person from Wu family handed Su Nantian the invitation and left.

Chapter 483: Attacked

Su Nantian immediately took the invitation into the room and gave it to Nangong Ping, saying: "It's from Wu family. An invitation for the banquet tonight."

Nangong Ping nodded and opened it, then smiled: "After this event is over, we can prepare to return home. Once Wu Chuan's people become the heir of the Wu family, our Nangong family can directly go to the inland port to take over."

After Nangong Ping and Nangong Yuyan had a little conversation, Nangong Yuyan returned to her room. Today the Wu family didn't have any arrangements, so they were quite free in the Wu family.

But Nangong Ping wouldn't go out随意. He just stayed in the suite's study, reading books and surfing the internet, which was quite leisurely.

Su Nantian wanted to take this opportunity to find Wu You'er, but he was under Nangong Ping's eyes. It was difficult for him to sneak away, so Su Nantian could only stay here.

But fortunately, he and Wang Meng were bodyguards, and Nangong Ping treated them well. They didn't have to stand like other bodyguards by the pole, but could be more relaxed. They could do whatever they wanted, just not leave his side.

After all, this was the Wu family. If Nangong Ping's bodyguards all left, his safety would be in danger. Moreover, there were other family members here. The Wang family who didn't like them was also present. There were many people wanting to disrupt the current stable situation among the major families, so there must be someone who wanted to take advantage of the chaos.

Moreover, the opportunity to gather several major families was rare. And they could stay here for such a long time, so there must be people who wanted to take advantage of the chaos.

Su Nantian could only sit on the sofa and watch his tablet, scrolling through news. Su Nantian suddenly felt that he hadn't been so relaxed for a long time. It was quite pleasant to have this small period of leisure.

However, the next moment directly interrupted Su Nantian's relaxation.

When Su Nantian and Nangong Ping and Wang Meng were each doing their own things in the room, suddenly there was a loud "Bang" sound. And the place where the sound came from wasn't anywhere else, but in the living room outside.

Fortunately, they were all inside the study, so they weren't harmed.

Nangong Ping was like a rabbit startled by fear. He stood up from his seat and said with wide eyes: "What's going on? Did something happen outside?"

Su Nantian didn't respond immediately. At this moment, he was mentally constructing the situation outside. This sound came directly from the living room, not from the door. So someone had entered their room but hadn't broken in. That meant there was only one way: they came through the ventilation from the living room. And this sound had a metallic sound, so Su Nantian could directly judge that it was the metal ventilation being kicked open.

Su Nantian immediately looked up at the study and found that there was only an air conditioning ventilation system, no ventilation. If someone wanted to enter the study, they had only one way: either come in through the window from outside or through the door.

But it was daytime, and during the day, entering through the window would be discovered by the numerous Wu family bodyguards outside. So they could only enter through this door.

After checking the layout, Su Nantian immediately said to Wang Meng: "Protect the master. You stay in the study, I'll check outside."

At this moment, Su Nantian could already hear footsteps outside. He calculated that there were four people, but based on their weight, they didn't seem to carry any guns. And at this time, if they shot, it would be caught immediately.

Su Nantian turned back and looked at Wang Meng and Nangong Ping, nodded to them, then quietly opened the study door and looked outside.

Indeed as Su Nantian had guessed, it was four people. At this moment, these four people were searching for something in the living room, which made Su Nantian a bit strange. Nangong Ping definitely wouldn't bring any secrets to the Wu family, so what were these people looking for?

Su Nantian looked at these four people and found they only had knives, nothing else. He felt relieved; this way he could easily deal with them and solve all four at once.

Nangong Ping thought Su Nantian was just checking the situation, but he never expected that in the next second, Su Nantian directly opened the door and rushed out.

Wang Meng was completely stunned. Although he knew Su Nantian had good skills, this one-on-four situation wasn't wise.

But to Su Nantian, it was completely nothing. Because he had to stay in the Nangong family to have opportunities to continue contacting the Wu family openly. Therefore, he must show his loyalty. Because he had already made enemies with Zeng Chao and Zhang Yu, to stand more firmly, he must make Nangong Ping rely on him.

These four people in the living room were searching for something they didn't find, then exchanged a glance and said: "Since we can't find it, let's find Nangong Ping. Kill him and the Nangong family will definitely be in chaos."

But as soon as they said this, they felt a gust of wind behind them. But before they could react, the person closest to Su Nantian was directly knocked out by Su Nantian's hand knife.

The other person, although he reacted quickly and stabbed at Su Nantian with a dagger, clearly aiming for the vital point. But Su Nantian was definitely not someone to be trifled with. He quickly dodged and hit the person's joint, knocking his dagger out of his hand. At the same time, another person came to support, but Su Nantian wasn't intimidated at all. He directly threw this person as an obstacle and made the two people collide with each other.

The last person saw the situation was bad. He knew that Su Nantian's strength far exceeded theirs, but they couldn't risk running away. One had already passed out and must be taken with them; otherwise, it would directly expose their identity.

At this moment, he saw the person pull out a gun from his waist and point it at Su Nantian's head, saying: "Stop! If you don't stop I'll shoot you!"

Chapter 484: A Mistake

Su Nantian never expected the enemy to actually carry a gun, but he immediately realized they were just trying to scare him. If they really shot, it would quickly expose their position, and the Wu family people would come to surround them immediately. Therefore, they definitely wouldn't shoot.

Because at this moment, one of their companions had already completely passed out. So he was trying to buy time for the other two people to take this person away; otherwise, if they left a live witness, when taken back by the Nangong family for interrogation, it might reveal who was behind them.

"I advise you not to act rashly. We just want to leave. If you let us go, I won't hurt you. But if you don't give us a way out, I also won't give you one." This person said fiercely, his gun still pointing at Su Nantian's head.

Actually, Su Nantian wasn't afraid. This gun was completely harmless to him; he could easily dodge the bullet's speed. But now there were not only himself but also Nangong Ping in the house, so he still had to weigh the situation.

Moreover, Su Nantian's main goal was to rescue Wu You'er and Wu Tao's family. He didn't know if he could use this opportunity to connect more with the Wu family. Thinking about this, Su Nantian's actions gradually stopped, pretending to be very afraid of them opening fire.

However, at this moment, Su Nantian heard the sound of a door opening from behind the study. He cursed inwardly; he had told Wang Meng and Nangong Ping before leaving that they should stay in the study and not come out. But where did these two people's curiosity go? Now they had opened the door, and at this moment, those two people who Su Nantian had knocked down were still behind him. If they rushed towards Nangong Ping, Su Nantian would be in a passive position because he had a gun in front of him.

The situation turned for the worst. Su Nantian hadn't expected that after he left, Wang Meng and Nangong Ping had heard the sound of a fight in the living room. But now they heard silence, thinking that Su Nantian had already subdued them. So they opened the study door to check out, but where did they expect that outside was still a standoff?

As Wang Meng walked in front and opened the study door, those two people who had been knocked down by Su Nantian suddenly got up and rushed towards the study. Even if Wang Meng reacted quickly, he was still a half-step behind.

How could Wang Meng's strength compare to two people's attack? The study door was instantly opened, and these two people had knives in their hands, directly holding the knives to Wang Meng's neck. This left one helpless Nangong Ping, who was immediately held at knife point by the other person's knife and forced to walk out of the study.

When Su Nantian saw these two people being held at knife point and walking towards him, he could only sigh helplessly. He had already told them not to open the door and stay inside, but now it was a complete disaster. Now he had become passive.

Originally, Su Nantian only needed to think about how to keep all four of them. But now he had to also consider Nangong Ping and Wang Meng's lives, which made the situation much more difficult.

These two people were now held at knife point and could not move, so they had to obey. This made Su Nantian's position passive. If it were before, he could have ignored Nangong Ping's life because his main goal was to rescue Wu You'er and Wu Tao's family. But now his plan had changed, and he still needed to rely on the Nangong family to have opportunities to contact the Wu family. Therefore, he must ensure Nangong Ping's safety.

"You don't act rashly. If you do anything to the master, you will also be in trouble. This is a big Wu family area. Even if you can escape from this house, you may not be able to get out of the villa. Even if you escape from the villa, don't you see the guards outside? From here to the main gate, there are people guarding. You can't escape at all. Even if you hide, they will find you. Then not only the Wu family will send everyone to look for you, but our Nangong family's people will also come immediately. Your situation would only be worse."

Su Nantian said this while observing their expressions and figuring out his next move.

Clearly, when Su Nantian said this, the enemy clearly hesitated. Because they knew what Su Nantian said was correct and not just a scare tactic.

So the four people clearly showed an expression of hesitation. Seeing this, Su Nantian continued: "If you want to leave, just let them go. If you release our master, I promise you can safely leave here. Once you step out of this door, we won't tell the Wu family about it and from then on, it's as if this never happened."

Su Nantian knew these people hadn't completed their mission yet, so they just wanted to escape. Therefore, he used the promise of safe departure as a lure and let them fall into his trap. Once they released Nangong Ping, everything would be resolved. As long as Nangong Ping was safe, Su Nantian could then take action to catch these people.

"You don't believe I have this power, do you? You're too high on yourself. Do you think I can really let you go?" This person suddenly said, apparently not believing that Su Nantian had such power to let them go.

Su Nantian smiled and said, "It doesn't matter if you don't believe I have this power. There's still our master here, right? You can definitely trust what he says. Besides, he's in your hands now. Would he risk his life and want to catch you?"

Su Nantian said this while looking at Nangong Ping constantly. He was really afraid that Nangong Ping would get stubborn and actually want to catch people without caring about his life.

"You say it yourself!" This assassin pointed at Nangong Ping and said.

Chapter 485: Escape

After hearing this, Nangong Ping nodded immediately and said, "You can rest assured. I'll keep my word. If you let me go without harming me, I'll make Su Nantian not chase after you. You can leave freely. I'll pretend this never happened and that we've never met today. Is that okay?"

Nangong Ping said this while raising his right hand seriously and making a gesture of swearing.

After hearing what Nangong Ping said, this person seemed to have some hesitation. Then he turned around and said to Su Nantian: "Okay, since your master has spoken, I'll cooperate with you. I want to take my people out. You won't block us. After we leave here, you won't chase after us or send anyone!"

Su Nantian nodded immediately and said: "Of course. Since your master has spoken, I definitely won't go against his will. You can rest assured about that."

"You come here. I'll hold the gun to him. You carry the one who's unconscious first, and we'll leave together." This person immediately ordered the person holding Nangong Ping to do so.

This person heard and immediately transferred Nangong Ping to the one holding the gun. Then he looked at Su Nantian with caution and walked over to the unconscious companion, lifting him up.

"You go first and open the door." This person held the gun to Nangong Ping's head and continued giving orders, this time to Su Nantian.

"Okay, I'll go now." Su Nantian could only nod and followed his instructions to the door.

"You come back, stand by the study. Once we leave this door, we'll let them go. You can rest assured." This person said again to Su Nantian, telling him to return after opening the door.

The study door was indeed a distance from the main gate, so when they escaped, Su Nantian might not be able to catch up immediately.

Su Nantian saw this situation and could only obediently follow the person's instructions to return, then stood by the study door. But Su Nantian kept watching Nangong Ping all the time, using his eyes to comfort him.

In fact, Su Nantian was most afraid that Nangong Ping would become too anxious because he was held at gunpoint. If he made a foolish move, everything would be over.

"You go first and take him out. Don't worry about us." This person ordered the one carrying the unconscious person to leave first.

This person nodded and immediately carried the unconscious person out of the room. At this point, there were only two assassins left in the room.

"You lock this big guy in the toilet." This person, to be safe, ordered his companion to lock Wang Meng up.
