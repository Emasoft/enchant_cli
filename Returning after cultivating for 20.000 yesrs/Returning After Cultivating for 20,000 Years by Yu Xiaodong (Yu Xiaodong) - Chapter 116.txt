When Su Nantian found Wang Bo, he was idly sitting on a chair, staring at his phone. People of his rank did not need to work; they merely supervised their subordinates, so he appeared incredibly relaxed.

Su Nantian approached with a grin. Upon seeing him, Wang Bo immediately asked, "I wonder what you need from me?"

Although Nangong Fei had clashed with them yesterday, these individuals could clearly see that Su Nantian, standing beside Nangong Fei, was relatively sensible. Thus, upon meeting him, they did not harbor much hostility.

If it had been Nangong Fei coming to see them, the scene would certainly not have been so harmonious.

Su Nantian smiled and said, "Old Wang, let's discuss things together."

"Discuss? What do we have to discuss?" Wang Bo feigned ignorance, asking this way.

"This matter is obvious. Why pretend to be confused?" Su Nantian continued, knowing that if Wang Bo was evading the issue, he would also play along.

In just these two sentences, Su Nantian realized that Wang Bo's temperament was not straightforward but rather cunning. The fact he had feigned ignorance earlier revealed this.

Yet the more cunning Wang Bo was, the happier Su Nantian felt. Those with too many schemes in their hearts were more likely to fall into the trap he had set.

Those who were direct and hot-blooded would be less likely to fall into such a game of palace intrigue.

After Su Nantian spoke, Wang Bo did not object. Thus, Su Nantian continued: "Old Wang, the reports you hold are of no use to you. You merely believe that Nangong Family's takeover of the Inland Port might harm your interests. However, we can guarantee that we are willing to negotiate terms; whatever you desire, we can provide. But we must maintain the Inland Port's normal operations."

As Su Nantian spoke, he observed Wang Bo's reaction. First, Wang Bo smiled and said, "This matter is not something you can approach me about."

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian felt a surge of joy. This time, Wang Bo had not denied the existence of the reports. Previously, they had always claimed to have no reports, only those blank sheets.

But now Wang Bo said it was useless to approach him. Thus, he had implicitly acknowledged the matter.

"Old Wang, if not you, then who? Among the three top bosses of the Inland Port, I believe you are the most capable. Within your trio's alliance, you must be the one with the final say. This matter certainly needs to be discussed with you."

In fact, Su Nantian's previous words were deliberate. He had not expected Wang Bo to fall into his trap so quickly, allowing him to conveniently flatter him.

It was precisely because Wang Bo currently held an ambiguous position in the Inland Port that these words had their intended effect.

At this moment, Wang Bo despised Li Zhe but also looked down on Zhang Yuan. However, his strength did not reach Zhang Yuan's level; he could only secretly worry within himself.

But at this moment, when someone told him that he was truly the leader of the Inland Port, it coincided with his inner thoughts.

Su Nantian naturally knew Wang Bo would not agree simply because of these two flatteries. However, this was planting a seed in Wang Bo's mind. The three of them were not solidly allied, and they each had their own interests while carefully considering both sides.

Zhang Yuan feared Wang Bo and Li Zhe uniting against him. Their combined strength would certainly surpass Zhang Yuan's.

As for Wang Bo, he wanted to eliminate Zhang Yuan but was unwilling to ally with Li Zhe. He also feared that Zhang Yuan would subdue Li Zhe.

Li Zhe, on the other hand, was inferior to both Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo. Thus, he had to be cautious at the bottom.

It was precisely because these three men harbored different thoughts that Su Nantian found an opportunity.

Their temporary alliance was solely for mutual benefit. However, if they could dismantle their interests and plant this seed in their minds, once the timing was right, a single spark could ignite them. Then, this alliance would collapse without resistance, and the Inland Port's transfer would proceed smoothly.

Upon hearing Su Nantian's words, Wang Bo did not show any expression on his face. However, he was actually very pleased. He shook his head and said, "Although I have some say in this matter, we three are currently aligned. Since you're a smart person, I won't beat around the bush. If you want those reports, they can only be obtained if all three of us agree. My power alone cannot convince the other two, so you should give up this idea."

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian immediately feigned a look of disappointment and said, "In that case, I suppose I'll have to go talk with the other two. Sorry for disturbing you."

After saying this, Su Nantian walked away from Wang Bo. However, he did not go to find Zhang Yuan and Li Zhe as he had said but returned to the office.

Yet Su Nantian did not see that, when he left, Wang Bo kept staring at his back. At this moment, Wang Bo's mind was also wavering. If he truly cooperated with the Nangong Family to run the Inland Port, within a year, he could surely grow stronger. Then even if the Nangong Family withdrew, and Wu Family regained control, he would have caught up with Zhang Yuan. He would no longer fear him.

Moreover, if he was the first to assist the Nangong Family, he would certainly receive special treatment. Then it would be very convenient for him to develop his influence in the Inland Port.

It was precisely because of Su Nantian's words that he felt he had been in the second position for too long. He also believed Zhang Yuan was unworthy of his position, wondering why so many followed him. Within their trio's alliance, although it was called an alliance, Zhang Yuan still held the most power and authority.

The more he thought about this situation, the angrier Wang Bo became. He felt he should be the one in charge rather than willingly sitting beneath Zhang Yuan. Especially since this was merely a small Inland Port, and he would not tolerate being humiliated under Zhang Yuan's rule. This was not how Wang Bo operated.

However, he would definitely not approach the Nangong Family himself. He needed to find a way for the Nangong Family to seek him out.

Chapter 576: A Chance Encounter

Su Nantian's approach was deliberately calculated. On the surface, he seemed to be coming to discuss matters with Wang Bo, but it was specifically to make Wang Bo feel the injustice between them.

This was merely one step in Su Nantian's plan. The most critical part, of course, was the woman at the massage parlor.

That same evening after work, Su Nantian continued with his plan and went to the massage city again. This time he was quite familiar.

When the woman entered the room and saw Su Nantian, she immediately knew his purpose. She asked, "So? Are you going to execute it today?"

Su Nantian shook his head and said, "Of course not today. Today is too soon. I just want to ask when Wang Bo and Li Zhe usually come to see you? Could they possibly meet?"

Upon hearing Su Nantian's question, the woman shook her head and smiled, "At first, they might have met by chance. But now that both of them know about each other's presence, how could they possibly cause trouble for one another? So now they come at intervals. Wang Bo usually comes around this time tomorrow, and Li Zhe might be a day or two later."

The woman recalled the patterns of Wang Bo and Li Zhe's visits. They weren't coming every day, as they had many responsibilities in the Inland Port. Even if they came daily, their finances would not support it.

"You should arrange for Wang Bo to come on the day Li Zhe visits you. Set the time a bit later, so he comes before Li Zhe leaves," Su Nantian thought for a moment and told the woman.

"But how could that be? He also knows when Li Zhe comes. If I invite him, he definitely wouldn't come," the woman waved her hands and did not think this was a good plan.

"You can just lie to him, saying Li Zhe isn't coming. But when Li Zhe does come, you must find a way to delay him so he can't leave and has to stay with you. This isn't too hard, is it?" After saying this, Su Nantian smiled. Every step he was about to take relied heavily on this woman, so Su Nantian felt a bit nervous. He had spent so much time planning but now the control was no longer in his hands.

The woman thought for a moment and said, "That's fine. I can do it."

However, just as they were talking, they heard a commotion outside. Because there were so many people, it was only clear that several people were arguing and seemed to be being blocked by the massage city's security.

Su Nantian immediately listened carefully. To his surprise, the person was Wang Bo.

"Sir, sir! Mr. Wang, we've already told you that the 38th beautician is with a customer now. It's not appropriate for you to barge in like this. There are customers inside!"

Su Nantian could hear the voice of the service staff outside. It turned out Wang Bo wanted to enter, but at this moment, he was already in the middle of a session. Naturally, these staff could not let Wang Bo in.

Su Nantian immediately came up with a plan and told the woman, "I'll hide first. Later, tell Wang Bo that the customer has left and relay what I told you."

After saying this, Su Nantian did not wait for a response but turned around and crawled under the bed, covering both sides with the sheet. From outside, there was no sign of anything unusual.

However, just a moment later, the door to the room was kicked open. Su Nantian sighed in relief. If he had been even a second later, he would have bumped into Wang Bo, and the situation would have become much more complicated. Moreover, his carefully thought-out plan would have been ruined.

"Where is anyone? Are you all lying to me?" When Wang Bo kicked open the door, there was no one else in the room except for this woman. He angrily addressed his security staff.

"Sorry, Mr. Wang. There was indeed a customer," the service staff said and then looked at the woman, asking, "What's going on? Where is the customer?"

"I don't know. He said he had to go urgently, but he hasn't returned. I think he must have left," the woman said without a flicker of emotion.

"Then if he's gone, I can come in now, right?" Wang Bo said confidently at this moment.

"Of course," the service staff said and quickly stepped out, closing the door. He knew Wang Bo's identity and that he often came to this massage city to bother this beautician.

He knew this person was not someone easy to deal with, but since there were other customers at the time, he could only endure it.

However, now the room was left with Wang Bo and this woman, as well as Su Nantian hiding under the bed unnoticed.

"Why did you come today? Usually, you should come tomorrow," this woman said.

"I just felt restless today, so I came to have you massage me," Su Nantian said. Then he suddenly felt the bed sink as Wang Bo got on it.

"Come over here, this side is better," this woman knew Su Nantian was hiding underneath and immediately said.

Wang Bo naturally did not think twice and moved over.

What followed was not what Su Nantian had feared. It was just this beautician and Wang Bo chatting while giving a massage.

"What's troubling you so much that you came today? If you're willing, you can tell me," this woman said while massaging Wang Bo.

Su Nantian suddenly understood why ancient people had the saying about a pillow talk and a beauty causing trouble. In this situation, men's pressure was especially high. Having someone massage him while softly asking about his troubles made it hard to keep secrets.

"Isn't it the matter with the Inland Port? We're all united against the new Nangong Family to share the spoils, but I think neither Zhang Yuan nor Li Zhe would choose to split it evenly. But if I can get the Nangong Family's support now, I could also expand my current power," Wang Bo said.

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian felt a surge of joy. He hadn't expected Wang Bo to have such thoughts inside his mind.

But even so, Su Nantian would not change his plan. His next steps would be a catalyst to deepen Wang Bo's thoughts.

"If it benefits you, then go ahead," the massage woman said casually.

"Many things can't be explained clearly. Some difficulties make me hesitate, so I'm still thinking about it," Wang Bo said and stopped talking. Then he said, "Enough of this. I came here to relax, but now we're talking about these annoying things."

The woman did not press further. She knew that Su Nantian, hiding under the bed, would definitely hear their conversation. However, Wang Bo had said he wouldn't continue talking, and if she pressed further, it would only make him suspicious.

After all, the woman usually didn't care much about Wang Bo's personal matters. She just wanted to make money.

"You're under so much pressure, how about coming tomorrow as well?" The woman suddenly remembered Su Nantian's instructions and said this.

"Tomorrow, I don't think Li Zhe usually comes on tomorrow, right?"

Hearing Wang Bo's words, Su Nantian couldn't help but smile slightly. It seemed these two were very clear about when they came and knew each other's status as rivals.

"Li Zhe said he might be busy recently, so he might not come. But if you're afraid of meeting him, don't come," the woman said casually, as if she didn't care whether Wang Bo came or not. Even though deep down she knew she had to get Wang Bo here.

Su Nantian also couldn't help but admire how effective this method of luring them in by pretending to let go was, especially when women were involved.

Sure enough, Wang Bo immediately said, "Of course I'll come. Even if I meet Li Zhe, what can he do? Do you think I'm afraid of him? In the Inland Port, my power is bigger than his. I advise you to stop associating with Li Zhe. I've told you before, it's better to follow me than Li Zhe. If you follow me, I'll let you have the best of everything. Whatever you want, I'll buy it for you. If you follow Li Zhe, he's so stingy and annoying that he'll drive you crazy."

What followed was mostly casual conversation between Wang Bo and the woman, which had little important information for Su Nantian.

After nearly an hour of massage, when Wang Bo finally left, Su Nantian crawled out from under the bed.

"How did I do today? Did I complete my task well?" The woman said proudly to Su Nantian.

"Indeed, it's quite good. I didn't expect your methods to be so much better than mine. Alright, you've worked hard today. I'll go back tomorrow," Su Nantian said to the woman and immediately left the room, driving back to the Nangong family.

Although this woman had already invited Wang Bo, Su Nantian still needed to prepare the environment for that day. At least he had to monitor the situation inside the room to confirm whether his plan was successful.

When Su Nantian returned to the villa's front door, he found Nan Gong Yuyan standing at the same spot as last night. It was so late, and she stood there only to wait for him; it couldn't be that she had nothing else to do at night and was just standing there for no reason.

Su Nantian suddenly remembered what Nan Gong Ping had said yesterday, that Nan Gong Yuyan might have feelings for him. Upon thinking of this, Su Nantian felt a bit nervous because he wasn't in a position to date right now. However, he was unsure how to handle Nan Gong Yuyan's feelings.

But Su Nantian had to face it. He couldn't keep hiding in the car forever, and he thought Nan Gong Yuyan wouldn't be so direct to talk about it. So she was probably going to discuss some work-related matters.

"You're a big man, why are you afraid?" Su Nantian said while patting his face lightly. He parked the car and got out.

Nan Gong Yuyan saw Su Nantian getting out of the car and waved to him, signaling him to come over.

So Su Nantian could only grit his teeth and walk towards where Nan Gong Yuyan was.

"What's the situation today? Any progress? Tomorrow my brother is going to the dock. Is there anything I should pay attention to? Or do I need to work with you to put pressure on them?"

As soon as Su Nantian approached, Nan Gong Yuyan asked a string of questions. This solved the awkward situation Su Nantian had felt earlier.

"You're coming tomorrow?" Su Nantian said in surprise. Although Nan Gong Yuyan was responsible for the Inland Port, many things didn't require her to go there personally.

"Can't I? And now the Inland Port is in such chaos, I should go help you fix it," Nan Gong Yuyan said while smiling.

Su Nantian quickly waved his hands and said, "No need. If you come, it's fine, but I hope you do nothing. My plan is already going smoothly now. The preliminary tasks are gradually being set up. Once the groundwork is done, the final spark will ignite this fuse, and we can solve all these problems."

Su Nantian was afraid that Nan Gong Yuyan would actually do something, and if she came tomorrow and did something unnecessary, his two days of preparation and effort would be in vain.

"You look so nervous. Don't you know that already? I was just teasing you. But actually, I'm going tomorrow as well. And Wu Chuan is also coming."

Upon hearing Nan Gong Yuyan's words, Su Nantian felt relieved. However, his nerves tensed again.

"Is Wu Chuan coming too? Why are the two of you going to the Inland Port?"

Su Nantian asked curiously. After all, Wu Chuan and Nan Gong Yuyan controlled the Inland Port, but many things didn't require them to go there personally. Like a boss running a company, he doesn't need to supervise production in the workshop himself.

So Su Nantian was curious why Wu Family would still go with Nan Gong Yuyan even though they had handed over the Inland Port to Nangong Family.

Chapter 577: Preparation

Nan Gong Yuyan, upon hearing Su Nantian's strong reaction, was curious and said, "Can't Wu Chuan go to the Inland Port? Why are you so surprised? This place was under our Nangong Family's control for a year, but it still belongs to the Wu family. It's not entirely under my ownership, so we can't stop him from going to the Inland Port.

Moreover, this time she's accompanying me to inspect the situation at the Inland Port. She said there were some issues that needed to be discussed directly with him. Can I refuse?"

Su Nantian shook his head and said, "Of course I can't stop Wu Chuan from going to the Inland Port. But my plan was just set up to undermine their three local bosses' faces? If Wu Chuan comes, and he instills some ideas in them, it might actually hinder my plan significantly."

Su Nantian's thoughts were about his plan. If Wu Chuan did something to these three local bosses, then his plan would be in vain and all his efforts would be wasted.

"What should I do? Is there anything you need me to pay attention to? Or can I help you keep an eye on Wu Chuan?" Upon hearing Su Nantian's words, Nan Gong Yuyan also thought it was very reasonable. She felt she should help Su Nantian do something.

Moreover, this plan was for the Nangong family. So Nan Gong Yuyan had no reason not to get involved in this matter.

"Try not to let Wu Chuan have close contact with these three people. Just keep an eye on them, but if they really want to get close, we can't stop them. Just let it be," Su Nantian actually had no good way to handle this. After all, if Wu Chuan wanted to get close to these three people, he had many ways. It wasn't necessary for him to meet them face-to-face; even a phone call could be possible. So even if Nan Gong Yuyan kept watch over Wu Chuan all day, it wouldn't stop Wu Chuan from meeting them.

"Okay, I understand. I'll try to keep an eye on him tomorrow. Are there any other things I can help with?" Nan Gong Yuyan continued asking, thinking that this matter shouldn't be something Su Nantian had to handle alone. It seemed Nan Gong Fei wasn't involved in these plans at all, just sitting on the sidelines doing nothing.

However, Nan Gong Yuyan also thought it was better for Nan Gong Fei not to be involved. Considering his usual behavior, it would be better if he didn't get involved in this matter.

Su Nantian just shook his head and said, "There's nothing else. For me, it's safer if nothing happens than if something does. I've already set everything up. In the next few days, we might be able to start wrapping it up."

According to Su Nantian's current plan, after the massage woman invited Wang Bo again and he met Li Zhe, the ensuing conflict would be what Su Nantian wanted. Then, after this incident, they would have a rift, and it would be easier to break them one by one.

Therefore, before that, it was better not to have any other incidents that might interfere with his plan.

Nan Gong Yuyan nodded and said, "Okay, I understand. I won't do anything unnecessary tomorrow. You should go rest now."

After saying this, Nan Gong Yuyan waved to Su Nantian and turned towards her villa.

Su Nantian also nodded and returned to Nan Gong Ping's villa. Unexpectedly, Nan Gong Ping was still in the living room, almost exactly like yesterday.

However, today Nan Gong Ping didn't say anything. But upon thinking about what Nan Gong Ping had said yesterday, Su Nantian felt a bit awkward.

So Su Nantian immediately said goodnight to Nan Gong Ping and returned to his room to rest.

Fortunately, Nan Gong Ping didn't show any special reaction. For Su Nantian, it was a relief.

However, Nan Gong Ping also felt puzzled about why Su Nantian seemed so unusual today. But after thinking it over, he realized these things weren't related to him and didn't pay much attention.

The next day, the Inland Port dock indeed had a group of people arriving. Su Nantian looked and saw it was Nan Gong Yuyan and Wu Chuan, accompanied by some bodyguards and assistants.

The two of them were chatting and walking over. It seemed they had come to check the current situation.

Wu Chuan was, after all, the owner of the Inland Port. When these people saw Wu Chuan, they were somewhat nervous.

"Have things been running smoothly in the Inland Port these past days?" Wu Chuan asked while walking with Nan Gong Yuyan.

Nan Gong Yuyan nodded and said, "Everything is normal."

If it had been yesterday when Nan Gong Yuyan hadn't met Su Nantian, she might have told Wu Chuan about the situation in the Inland Port. But now she knew Su Nantian had his own arrangements, and she couldn't disrupt his rhythm. So even though she was very tempted to criticize the three local bosses at the Inland Port, she held back.

At this time, Zhang Yuan, Wang Bo, and Li Zhe were also diligently working with the workers at their posts. Usually, these three men would sit in their rooms or on chairs doing their own things. But today, knowing Wu Chuan was coming, they put on a show.

However, the interaction between Wu Chuan and these three people did not happen. They just took a brief tour before leaving. Before departing, Wu Chuan gave them a wink, indicating everything was safe.

After seeing Wu Chuan leave, Su Nantian finally felt relieved. Even his sidekick Nan Gong Fei looked relaxed.

"This Wu Chuan left, and he didn't cause any trouble," Nan Gong Fei said with a smile.

"If he really wanted to cause trouble, there's no need for him to come himself. It seems today was truly just a visit with Nan Gong Yuyan to inspect the Inland Port. After all, after the previous incident of fighting for the family head position, now Wu Family and Nangong Family are a small alliance. Although it's not very solid, some surface gestures still need to be done.

After all, Wu Family and Nangong Family only had a one-year cooperation period. So both sides didn't invest too much, but surface gestures and etiquette still needed to be done. Therefore, today Wu Chuan was specifically taking a break to accompany Nan Gong Yuyan on an inspection of the Inland Port.

Chapter 578: The Trap

Since Wu Chuan's visit to the Inland Port didn't cause any problems, there were no issues for Su Nantian's arrangements.

Su Nantian now only needed to wait for the day after tomorrow, and he would see the results of his plan.

However, on that same day, Su Nantian immediately went to the massage city and installed some miniature cameras in this room so he could monitor the situation from the adjacent room.

As the saying goes, money can make even ghosts work. All of Su Nantian's equipment was paid for by Nan Gong Fei, so Su Nantian didn't feel any pain.

Wang Bo arrived as scheduled. Su Nantian hadn't expected Wang Bo to be so eager. Just as Su Nantian had left the adjacent room and entered this one, he hadn't even sat down yet when the door opened, and Wang Bo walked in.

Wang Bo greeted the woman briefly before entering the massage process.

"You've improved your muscles compared to last time. Last time, they were tense, but now you're relaxed a bit. I guess your troubles have been resolved?" The woman said while massaging Wang Bo.

"What resolution? It's just that this kid has been quiet these past few days. But the more he stays quiet, the more I'm confused. He's not asking for his things back, but instead just waiting quietly. Is he planning something else?"

Wang Bo said this while asking curiously, because he felt Su Nantian had indeed been unusual these past days. Su Nantian and Nan Gong Fei came to the Nangong family for performance, but now the reports were still in their hands. These two only made a symbolic visit and then stayed quietly in their office without causing any trouble.

It was precisely this attitude that made Wang Bo feel slightly anxious, as he felt Su Nantian and Nan Gong Fei were planning something secretly. No matter how they probed, they couldn't find out.

In fact, Wang Bo's feeling was correct. He had no idea he had already walked into the trap and that this trap would be closed tonight.

Moreover, upon seeing this scene, Su Nantian couldn't help but admire the massage woman. Throughout the process, she remained calm and composed without any signs of embarrassment or shock from hearing other news. Everything was normal.

However, the woman's ability to remain calm was related to her profession. They often received clients from various industries, and sometimes they would say things that couldn't be said outside. Therefore, she had developed this ability to remain calm regardless of what the client said.

At this moment, Wang Bo and himself were in the same situation. Therefore, when Wang Bo spoke these things, the massage woman didn't show any signs of unease. She didn't appear nervous or guilty for being involved in this chain of traps.

Additionally, since Su Nantian had specifically instructed her not to ask about the Inland Port during their conversation, they were just going through a normal conversation.

Su Nantian looked at the time on his phone and knew that according to Li Zhe's habits, he should arrive soon. Su Nantian felt a slight tension now because whether this plan would succeed depended on tonight.

However, at this moment, Su Nantian also heard a commotion from the corridor. It was like the previous situation with Wang Bo, and Li Zhe also had been blocked by the staff.

But Li Zhe's approach was completely the same as Wang Bo's. He didn't care about the staff's blockage and just opened the door, only to find that the woman was giving Wang Bo a massage.

Li Zhe's face immediately changed and he pointed at Wang Bo, saying, "What are you doing here? Get out of here right now!"

Su Nantian watched the monitor's image and couldn't help but be surprised. He hadn't expected these two to immediately tell Wang Bo to leave without even a greeting.

Su Nantian could see that this time, the relationship between these three local bosses was indeed not very harmonious. Perhaps it was because of Nangong Family's appearance that these people had to unite.

At this moment, the woman also looked very surprised and said, "You didn't say you were coming today?"

"I said I might be busy recently and couldn't come, but I didn't say I definitely wouldn't. But Wang Bo, you really took advantage of the situation," Li Zhe said.

Li Zhe's anger was directed at Wang Bo. They were both rivals, and in the Inland Port, Wang Bo's strength was slightly greater than his. Therefore, this time Li Zhe felt extremely angry upon seeing Wang Bo here because he was the lowest in their alliance and had to follow their decisions.

As for the Inland Port's matters, it was fine. But he had also lost his woman to Wang Bo.

So upon entering the door, he immediately exploded and told Wang Bo to leave.

Wang Bo was also extremely angry. Li Zhe had entered and told him to leave, but he couldn't bear it. Usually, when Wang Bo met Li Zhe, he would look down on him. But this time, the man had dared to point at his nose and tell him to leave.

Wang Bo got up and pointed at Li Zhe, saying, "I think you're impatient to die. Who did you just tell to leave?"

"Just you," Li Zhe also didn't back down, and the two of them were now in a very tense situation.

However, Su Nantian was delighted inside. He hadn't expected his plan to proceed so smoothly and beyond his expectations.

In fact, Su Nantian's original plan was just to create some suspicion and distance between them. But he hadn't expected these two to have already developed into such a situation, which was even more intense than what Su Nantian had anticipated.

If his original expectation was to create small conflicts and feelings of resentment, then now Wang Bo and Li Zhe had already taken this hatred to the surface. They were about to break into open hostility.

Chapter 579: Opportunity

The argument between Wang Bo and Li Zhe was not only because they had met tonight, nor just because of the massage woman. They had long-standing grudges, and this incident was merely the trigger.

Moreover, recently they had to unite because of their three families. So there were many conflicts in some matters, but both sides knew they couldn't turn on each other now. They had to endure and unite.

So, everyone could only hold back. But now it was this place where they couldn't hold back anymore.

The tension between these two had become increasingly intense. After a quarrel, they eventually started fighting. However, the situation didn't get too bad because the staff had immediately run out to call security. Within minutes, the security arrived and separated them.

But both Wang Bo and Li Zhe had injuries on their faces, looking somewhat battered.

After this commotion, neither of them could stay there. They were both driven out by the security. Both left in anger, their eyes still filled with some residual fury. It was unknown whether these two would find a place to continue their fight after leaving the massage city.

After confirming that both had left safely, Su Nantian walked out from the adjacent room and happily transferred the remaining money to this woman's account.
