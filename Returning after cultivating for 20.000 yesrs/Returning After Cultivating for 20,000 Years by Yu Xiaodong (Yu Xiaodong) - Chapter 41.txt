“No, I need someone to be nice to me right now!” Zhu Ying’s usual image as a kind and friendly teacher had somewhat crumbled; she was now indulging in drunken mischief.

Su Nantian simply wanted to soothe Zhu Ying’s emotions so his ears could be saved. Otherwise, Zhu Ying’s loud crying would torment Su Nantian, whose hearing was exceptionally sharp.

He cleared his throat and placed his hands on Zhu Ying’s shoulders. Zhu Ying, dazed, followed the path of Su Nantian’s arms to gaze at his hands on her shoulders.

“Look at me.” Su Nantian shook Zhu Ying’s shoulders, and she turned her bewildered gaze to his face.

“Since you are a princess who’s just been abandoned, I can be your fairy godfather. I promise to grant you one wish.” Su Nantian spoke earnestly to Zhu Ying, but she only sniffled without responding.

“You see, princesses can make wishes. You have a chance to fulfill your wish—aren’t you already a princess?” Su Nantian coaxed again, patient.

Zhu Ying finally nodded slowly: “I… I am…”

Before she could finish, the last traces of alcohol in her body rose up, and her eyelids drooped. Su Nantian quickly laid her back on the bed.

Minutes later, Zhu Ying’s even, prolonged breaths echoed from the bed.

Su Nantian finally exhaled deeply, his tense muscles relaxing. He glanced around the room, confirming no danger was present. He intended to go home but remembered that his three women had already gone to sleep, and he didn’t want to disturb them. He reached into his pockets for his keys.

After checking his jacket and pants pockets, Su Nantian’s brow furrowed: “Oops, I forgot my keys.”

He rubbed his hair and muttered, “Looks like I’ll have to stay here tonight.”

He sighed heavily, resignedly sitting on the sofa across from the bed.

…

Half an hour later, Zhu Ying stirred awake, blinking her eyes open to see the unfamiliar ceiling. Her head throbbed painfully; she sat up, rubbing her temples for relief. She also spotted Su Nantian sitting on the sofa across from her.

Zhu Ying froze, then remembered what had happened before she fell asleep again. Her beautiful face flushed with a deep red.

Su Nantian was startled awake by Zhu Ying’s movement and looked up to see her staring at him.

“You’re awake? Did the alcohol wear off?” Su Nantian sat beside her, speaking gently. Zhu Ying, seeing his face so close, grew redder.

Chapter 192: Go Buy It!

Su Nantian noticed Zhu Ying’s faintly red face and worried if she was sick, but his mouth spoke first.

“Why is your face so red?” He reached to touch her forehead to check for a fever. The moment his hand met her forehead, Zhu Ying abruptly slapped it away.

Su Nantian was taken aback but realized he had been too forward, so he said nothing and watched Zhu Ying.

Suddenly, the room’s atmosphere reached an awkward peak. To give herself a way out of her previous actions, Zhu Ying got up from the bed and said, “I’m all over alcohol; I feel uncomfortable. I’ll take a shower.”

This statement surprised both Zhu Ying and Su Nantian: “Then, I’ll go out?”

Zhu Ying’s face stiffened. She felt she had already received too much kindness from Su Nantian and didn’t want to burden him with the inconvenience of going out into the cold. She shook her head: “It’s fine, no one can see anything. I’ll just take a shower and come out.”

Seeing Zhu Ying didn’t even try to avoid it, Su Nantian, a man, felt more embarrassed and nodded: “Then go ahead. I’ll rest on the sofa.”

Zhu Ying murmured, “Hmm,” and opened the bathroom door.

The room was now only Su Nantian. To avoid suspicion, he lay on the sofa facing away from the bathroom and feigned sleep.

But the sound of water from the bathroom disturbed Su Nantian’s rest.

The room was silent, and Su Nantian, with his sharp hearing, could even discern the intensity of Zhu Ying’s shower.

He missed his three wives at home more than ever.

After half an hour of bathing, Zhu Ying emerged wearing the hotel’s bathrobe. Seeing Su Nantian facing away from the bathroom, a strange loneliness surfaced in her heart.

Su Nantian heard Zhu Ying’s footsteps and turned to look at her: “Did you finish?”

Zhu Ying glanced down at herself, feeling ashamed and nodded: “I did….”

“What’s wrong?” Su Nantian detected something unusual in her voice and asked, “What happened?”

Zhu Ying bit her lip, hesitating before saying: “It’s just… the clothes I wore were stained with alcohol and can’t be worn. I left them in the bathroom to wash later, but…”

Su Nantian tilted his head, confused: “But?”

Zhu Ying swallowed and quickly said the awkward part: “But my undergarments were also stained. I can’t wear them, and it’s uncomfortable without them. So… you go buy it for me!”

After saying that, Zhu Ying opened her eyes and secretly glanced at Su Nantian, who was like a statue. After a while, he finally spoke: “Me? Go buy it?”

“I can’t go out…” Zhu Ying tugged at her bathrobe and added, “You said you could grant me one wish. So my wish is for you to go buy it…” Zhu Ying’s voice grew quieter, her confidence wavering as she glanced at Su Nantian.

Su Nantian’s face darkened. After thinking, he finally nodded: “I’ll check nearby if there are any stores.”

Without waiting for Zhu Ying to thank him, Su Nantian rushed out the door.

When Su Nantian wrapped his coat tightly and stood in the cold wind at over one o’clock in the morning, he regretted agreeing to Zhu Ying’s wish. But since he had already said it, retracting was unwise.

He glanced at the empty street and saw only one store still lit: a 24-hour convenience store. Su Nantian sighed heavily and strode toward it.

Su Nantian pushed open the store’s door, and the warm air greeted him. The convenience store had no one else; the cashier was yawning constantly.

Su Nantian was too embarrassed to ask others where underwear was sold, so he wandered around the store until he found the section. Turning his head, he spotted a row of colorful underwear and hurried over to pick one.

But Su Nantian, being a man, wasn’t familiar with such items. He frowned as he examined the hangers for minutes without choosing anything suitable.

Meanwhile, a girl in the food section saw Su Nantian flipping through underwear and burst out: “Ugh, who’s the pervert this late?”

The girl marched over to Su Nantian, who was carefully selecting, and demanded: “What are you doing? Do you think I’ll call the police?”

Su Nantian looked up at her. She was a girl in a Fengcheng No. 1 High School uniform, about five feet tall, with a typical baby face but long straight hair like current internet celebrities. Her uniform had a student ID card with her photo and name: Zhao Ling.

Su Nantian asked, “I didn’t steal or rob anything; why would you call the police?”

The girl pointed at the pair of underwear in front of Su Nantian: “A big man like you holding underwear and smiling so lewdly—what a pervert. Why shouldn’t I call the police?”

Su Nantian sighed, “I’m buying it for my girlfriend.” He had intended to say ‘teacher,’ but thinking it would only confuse Zhao Ling further, he lied and said ‘girlfriend’ instead.

Zhao Ling didn’t believe it and still thought Su Nantian was making an excuse. But since Su Nantian had already dug himself a hole, Zhao Ling wouldn’t easily give him an exit.

Zhao Ling nodded knowingly: “Then do you know your girlfriend’s size?”

Su Nantian’s face turned red as he gestured: “Approximately this big.”

Zhao Ling was more convinced that the girlfriend was just a fabrication.

“You don’t understand girls; I’ll pick it for you.” Zhao Ling said with a pair of lively eyes.

Su Nantian quickly agreed, handing over the task entirely to Zhao Ling.

When Zhao Ling smiled mischievously and handed Su Nantian the bag, he thanked her, paid, and left.

Zhao Ling watched Su Nantian’s back and muttered: “Too bad, such a handsome guy is a pervert!”

…

When Su Nantian returned to the bar room with the bag, Zhu Ying was already dozing on the bed.

“I’m back.”

Zhu Ying had already woken up at the sound of the door opening. Seeing Su Nantian had returned what she needed, she quickly thanked him and went to the bathroom to change.

In the bathroom, Zhu Ying stared at the tiny piece of fabric with many holes in it and suddenly felt Su Nantian was so lewd—probably did it on purpose…

Zhu Ying lingered in the bathroom for ten minutes before reluctantly emerging. She had been worried Su Nantian might have ulterior motives, but when she opened the door, she saw Su Nantian fast asleep on the sofa.

Zhu Ying’s heart felt a strange sense of loss, but she quickly pushed the thought away and fell asleep.

They spent the night without incident.

Chapter 193: Lunch Date?

Su Nantian emerged from the bathroom, wearing only a towel around his waist. His upper body’s triangular physique was perfectly displayed in the air.

Zhu Ying blushed and muttered, “Pervert.”

But she had just said it when Su Nantian overheard. He raised an eyebrow, met her gaze, and placed his hand on the towel at his waist, saying: “Want to know what real pervert means?”

Zhu Ying blushed again and grabbed a nearby pillow, throwing it at Su Nantian. The arc of the pillow landed perfectly in Su Nantian’s hands, and he stared at Zhu Ying with a fiery gaze.

This kind of intense look usually seen on men made Zhu Ying shrink slightly but also felt anticipation for what was to come.

She cast Su Nantian a glance with her eyes full of emotion, and Su Nantian licked his lips before walking toward Zhu Ying’s bed.

Just as their lips met,
Suddenly, Zhu Ying opened her eyes and rubbed her head groggily.

Feeling the morning sunlight on her face, she blinked her eyes and sat up. She met Su Nantian’s gaze directly on the sofa, and Zhu Ying was momentarily stunned, her red lips slightly open.

“Did you have a nightmare?” Su Nantian asked.

Remembering the dream she had just had, Zhu Ying blushed: “N-no… no.”

This confused Su Nantian. “Then why did you start moaning and groaning? I thought you had a nightmare.”

Zhu Ying’s face turned instantly crimson: “Mind your own business! I said no, so it’s no!”

Su Nantian’s lips twitched and he nodded quickly: “Fine, I’ll stop meddling. Also, there’s an hour left until class starts.”

“What!” Zhu Ying jumped off the bed and pointed at Su Nantian: “Why didn’t you tell me earlier!”

Su Nantian shrugged and said, “I thought you were too engrossed in your moaning to wake up.” After saying that, he lay back down on the sofa.

Only Zhu Ying was anxious, pacing barefoot around the room. She scratched her long hair: “What to do? I haven’t washed or put on makeup… Oh, I didn’t bring my makeup either. Ah…” Zhu Ying groaned and sat down with her face in her hands.

“They’ll see my natural face! How can that be allowed!”

Su Nantian, lying on the sofa and listening to Zhu Ying’s complaints, smiled slightly. His three wives at home usually took an hour and a half to get ready; this time, they had slept too late. Su Nantian also felt like sleeping in.

After ten minutes, a blanket was thrown over Su Nantian’s face. He grabbed it and sat up to see Zhu Ying already dressed.

“You’ve changed your clothes, so your strength has increased. Are you a magical girl?”

Zhu Ying was furious but ignored him, instead rummaging in Su Nantian’s coat pocket. Su Nantian frowned slightly; he didn’t like others touching his things.

Zhu Ying pulled out a mask from Su Nantian’s pocket and her face lit up with joy: “Ah! I found it! I remembered yesterday!”

She quickly put the mask on her face and patted her chest: “Now I don’t have to worry about students seeing my natural face.”

“What about me?” Su Nantian raised an eyebrow and asked: “I’m a public figure. If you do this, I’ll be recognized by many people and cause unnecessary trouble.”

Zhu Ying, who was happy and patting her mask, said: “Don’t even think about it. Between your face and mine, of course I choose to protect myself.”

Su Nantian was completely defeated by Zhu Ying and didn’t argue further. He took out his phone from his coat pocket and called Zhang Xiaojun.

“Hey, it’s the same room as last night. Bring me a mask quickly.”

…

Twenty minutes later, Zhang Xiaojun arrived out of breath at the door. Su Nantian knew it was him and opened the door: “Come in.”

Zhang Xiaojun nodded while panting, then handed Su Nantian the new mask under his gaze.

After handing over the mask, Zhang Xiaojun realized something and asked: “Brother, you didn’t leave last night?”

Su Nantian glanced at him without answering. Zhu Ying just came out of the bathroom and saw Su Nantian had put on the new mask. She quickly said: “You’re ready too, let’s go. If we’re late, we’ll be late.”

Even though Su Nantian thought: “I don’t know who was so slow before,” he didn’t dare say it directly. He nodded and walked out first.

…

They almost arrived at the school with the bell ringing. Zhu Ying muttered, “Bad luck,” and didn’t even say goodbye to Su Nantian before pulling out her teacher’s card to check in at the office.

Su Nantian looked at Zhu Ying’s direction and casually went to the military training field.

After yesterday’s torment from Coach Chen Ping, it didn’t achieve Chen Ping’s intention but instead helped Su Nantian gain more fans. This time, facing Su Nantian’s lateness, Chen Ping ignored him.

But since the military training formation was essential, one person couldn’t be missing. Su Nantian saw this and didn’t greet Chen Ping but went to his position himself.

Chen Ping glared at Su Nantian, though he was discontented, but without a plan to trouble Su Nantian, he could only stay silent.

The morning military training passed quickly. The whistle for a break sounded repeatedly on the field, and students cheered, stopping their training to sit on the track.

After a while, they would regroup and count people before going to eat.

Su Nantian sat with a few classmates near the wall, intending to sunbathe. After closing his eyes, a shadow suddenly covered him.

Su Nantian opened his eyes警惕ly; the coldness in his gaze made Cao Yun step back a bit. But remembering her purpose, she approached Su Nantian despite the fear.

Seeing it was Cao Yun, Su Nantian relaxed his tension. Although no one could threaten Su Nantian in the world, after two thousand years of cultivation in the immortal realm, this had become a habit.

“Su Nantian… thank you for treating my foot injury that day… I want to invite you to lunch…”

Chapter 194: Friendship Match

Cao Yun’s voice grew gentler, causing the male classmates around Su Nantian to envy and exclaim “Ohh!”

But Su Nantian remained indifferent.

Time passed, but Su Nantian didn’t respond. Cao Yun wasn’t in a hurry; she lowered her head, blushed, and stood there obediently waiting for Su Nantian to speak.

Other girls would have already been furious or cried, but Cao Yun’s persistence didn’t work. Su Nantian sighed inwardly: “It was just a small favor; you don’t need to take it seriously.”

Cao Yun smiled happily: “Then, Su Nantian, are you willing to have lunch with me?”

Behind Cao Yun was Zhang Mengyao, who was resting against the wall. Yesterday’s acupuncture had cured one-third of Zhang Mengyao’s birthmark. To avoid drawing attention, she still used thick bangs to cover half her face. Plus, Su Nantian had kindly taken Zhang Xiaojun as his subordinate and cut off his connections with those low-level organizations.

This made Zhang Mengyao even more respectful and grateful to Su Nantian. At that moment, she watched Cao Yun talking to Su Nantian and unexpectedly approached without any jealousy.

Cao Yun’s innocent joy was adorable, drawing many men on the field to look at her with romantic eyes. Cao Yun focused only on Su Nantian, but her eyes also scanned the surrounding men’s reactions.

At that moment, Cao Yun felt a bit proud and lifted her feet slightly.

Cao Yun thought no one could see through her thoughts, but these little tricks were all seen by Su Nantian who had lived for two thousand years.

Just as Su Nantian’s lips curled to say something surprising, a commotion from the distant group of Chen Ping’s soldiers started.

The noise was so loud that even Su Nantian, far away, heard it.

Students quickly gathered around, and the outer circle grew thicker. But the center’s quarrel between the instructors became clearer.

Cao Yun, distracted, felt an urge to go check it out. If two instructors quarreled, as a class monitor, she could persuade them with emotional appeals and gain many fans.

But currently, she needed to invite Su Nantian for lunch.

Cao Yun’s eyes showed a rare hesitation.

Su Nantian saw it and raised an eyebrow, thinking: “It seems beauty is no match for power.”

At that moment, the quarreling instructors gradually cooled down. Su Nantian understood; these instructors were from the military, with strict discipline. Though disciplined, hot-blooded men inevitably quarreled over small matters—this was natural. As long as no physical fights happened, the officers would turn a blind eye.

Plus, the officers understood these hot-blooded men’s emotions; who wasn’t like that in their youth?

The instructors dispersed, returning to their respective teams. Su Nantian saw a talkative student from his class accompanying an instructor, and they walked together.

The instructor was still angry; he took off his hat, rubbed his head, and muttered something.

Su Nantian wasn’t in a hurry; he thought when they arrived, everything would be clear.

Sure enough, seeing the instructors returned, students automatically lined up again. The instructor saw the relatively well-behaved students and let out a little fire.

“Listen up, everyone!” The instructor shouted with his loud voice, much higher than usual, as if deliberately shouting at someone.

“Why are you doing military training? To build a strong body, right!” The instructor glared with his fierce eyes, scanning over the students’ heads like a scythe.

The students didn’t dare to respond but shouted back: “Answer, sir! Yes!”

The instructor nodded in satisfaction and continued: “Then what is the purpose of having a strong body!”

This time, students didn’t know what the instructor was up to and dared not answer. They also dared not whisper among themselves.

The instructor’s previous satisfied expression turned iron-willed: “To not be looked down upon!”

Students, hearing the answer, quickly followed and replied: “Answer, sir! Yes!”

“Then now someone looks down on us, saying our bodies are weak and can’t even play volleyball. You say, should we let this slide!”

Su Nantian now understood why the instructor was angry. This kind of incident leading to a match between two classes was common in modern military training, and no matter the outcome, this impulsive act would become a friendship later.

“Let’s go!” Students, hearing that, were angry and quickly agreed.

“Good, I’ve raised such students! When faced with problems, don’t be afraid of them. If they dare to come looking for trouble, we’ll beat them into submission!”

The instructor led the students with热血.

The instructor secretly cleared his throat, which had become hoarse from shouting, then let the student who had come back with him step forward.

The student was smart; he understood people’s feelings immediately. Seeing the instructor gesture to him, he quickly stepped out and stood in front, cleared his throat, and said: “Students, here’s the situation!”

“Class 2 English class’s monitor and instructors said our class is weak, saying we can’t even play volleyball. Maybe they’ll end up playing volleyball with people.”

Students in the line started cursing under their breath.

The student was satisfied with the infectious power of his speech and continued: “But our instructor, who is always concerned about us, got angry and argued with Class 2 English’s instructors. He told them to manage their people.”

“But they didn’t listen,” the student continued, “they said it was true and challenged us. Our instructor got angry and said we’d fight.”

“So, our match is set. Now we’re waiting for the other side to confirm the time.”

Finally, he cleared his throat and added: “But I believe our class will definitely win!”

“Win!” Students also erupted into shouts.

Chapter 195: Team Members

Even Su Nantian felt some resentment toward Class 2 English. On the surface, they looked like gentlemen, but due to their major, they often mixed some English terms into conversations. Though this was common in the school, since everyone could get in, their English skills were exceptional. The problem was that some of Class 2 English’s people would use a few English words, and if others couldn’t respond, they’d mock them.

Su Nantian had heard about this tradition from Lin Suyun before. At that time, Lin Suyun was very upset: “If they dare to talk to me like this one day, I’ll tell them how English is written backward.”

Thinking of that, Su Nantian couldn’t help but smile. A classmate saw his smile and exclaimed: “Su Nantian smiled! This must be a confident smile for victory!”

Thus, the entire class focused their eyes on Su Nantian. Su Nantian’s lips twitched, but he didn’t dare to burst the classmate’s beautiful illusion and quickly hid his smile.

When Chen Ping heard Su Nantian’s name, a light flashed in his eyes. Su Nantian’s physical strength had been certified by him. With such a powerful ally, they would definitely make the other side cry and call for their mothers!

Thinking this, Chen Ping smiled confidently.

“Hey, you haven’t even lost yet and are already discussing how to save face?” A mocking voice came from the back of the formation. Everyone quickly turned their heads toward the source.

Chen Ping sneered and stepped out of the crowd to meet him: “What, your instructor is too scared to fight and sent you here as a messenger?”

“Messenger?” Qian Fachen looked back at the classmates who had come with him, and they all laughed together.

“Hey, instructor, don’t dream here. Let our instructor give up this chance to step on us—it’s impossible.” Qian Fachen extended a finger and shook it.

Class 1 English, hearing this mockery, had many people clenching their fists. Qian Fachen didn’t stop but continued: “Our instructor told me to tell you, we’ll beat you. Oh no, the match.” Qian Fachen pretended to say the wrong word and apologized with a bow: “The match is scheduled for this afternoon. Our instructor has already discussed it with the chief commander, and he’ll give us time to play this afternoon. Then…”

Qian Fachen extended the same finger and pointed randomly in the formation: “Hope you don’t miss it, everyone must come.”

After saying that, Qian Fachen changed his annoying expression into a contemptuous one and sneered before leaving with his subordinates.

Not only was Chen Ping angry, but Su Nantian also felt some anger. It was really infuriating.

After Qian Fachen left, the class quickly gathered to discuss privately.

Because Shen Fei was hospitalized, everyone unconsciously regarded Su Nantian as the new class monitor and looked at him with sincere eyes.

Su Nantian felt a shock throughout his body; these looks meant he would be blamed for the big pot. But now, even if students didn’t voluntarily make him class monitor, Zhu Ying had already given him the order.

But one thing made Su Nantian feel lucky: he was glad no one had told the truth about Zhu Ying’s order.

Otherwise, not only this volleyball match would be a problem, but Su Nantian might never have a day of peace.

These sincere looks gradually became intense, making Su Nantian feel overwhelmed. Zhang Mengyao wanted to step forward and help Su Nantian but, realizing she couldn’t play volleyball, had to give up and lower her head.

Chen Ping naturally noticed Su Nantian’s leadership, but since he had punished him yesterday, he was hesitant to talk with Su Nantian.

A classmate known for being a big mouth immediately understood Chen Ping’s dilemma and stepped forward boldly, shouting: “Instructor, this is a big issue for the whole class. Look at our class; the monitor was beaten to hospital, and without a monitor, what should we do?”

Chen Ping’s eyes flashed with satisfaction. He knew about Shen Fei’s situation and quickly took the opportunity to ask: “Oh? Your monitor was beaten to hospital? Who did it?”

The big mouth nervously glanced at Su Nantian and said: “It was our class’s Su student.”

Su Nantian watched the two actors exchanging words and found it amusing.

The instructor didn’t pay attention to Su Nantian’s gaze; he just wanted to resolve these problems quickly. Su Nantian’s strength was indeed formidable, and to not disappoint the big mouth’s effort, the instructor pretended to be angry and approached Su Nantian.

“You hit your class monitor! Since your monitor isn’t here, you should take responsibility and make up for it!”

Su Nantian was truly impressed by the two actors’ performance. He had intended to explain the situation, but thinking that even if he explained it clearly, Zhu Ying would still push this onto him, so he didn’t waste his breath.

“Okay, I understand.” Su Nantian replied.

Chen Ping immediately widened his eyes in surprise; he hadn’t expected Su Nantian to be so compliant today after being punished yesterday.

“Although I can lead, it’s not just one person’s job. I need team members, instructor.” Su Nantian said.

“Of course,” the instructor nodded and turned to the disarrayed formation, asking seriously: “Who among you is good at volleyball? Come forward now. This is a chance to contribute to the class, don’t hide!”

As soon as he finished speaking, two tall brothers stepped forward from the leftmost side: “We are twins. I’m Gao Xiang’an.”

The other tall brother said: “I’m Gao Xingzhi. We used to attend a volleyball training camp.”

The instructor eyed them and nodded: “Good, back in line.”

They understood each other and stood beside Su Nantian.

After that, three more people were inspired to step forward.

“I’m Liu Yang! I used to play volleyball with my dad at home!”

“I’m Song Jin. I often play volleyball in my spare time.”

“Me too, I’m He Tao…”

Chapter 196: Lunch Hopper

If the first two twins were relatively standard, the next three were all nonsense.

Su Nantian looked at the three people standing in a row with an inquiry, but they all smiled without hesitation. Chen Ping felt a wobble and his body swayed slightly.

“Is there anyone else?” Chen Ping, unwillingly, asked again in the crowd.

The formation responded with silence. Chen Ping pressed his lips and was about to ask again. At this point, the three people realized that Chen Ping was clearly looking down on them and would continue to search for others in the formation.

First, Liu Yang stepped forward a step closer to Chen Ping and asked: “Instructor, what do you mean? You asked if anyone could contribute to the class, so we stood up. If you don’t want us three, just say it directly.”

He Tao also complained: “Exactly. You keep putting us aside and asking others if they can play volleyball, where do we stand?”

Song Jin, who wore glasses and looked like a gentle scholar, was also dissatisfied. Perhaps he couldn’t accept being rejected after standing up. He pressed his lips and said: “Instructor, you asked once already. If there’s anyone else besides us three, just have them replace me.”

Chen Ping heard this and was in an awkward situation. He had indeed prompted the students to stand up for the class, but these three people’s volleyball skills felt so unreliable.

Unwillingly, he scanned the formation again and saw no one else coming forward. Finally, Chen Ping sighed inwardly, hoping Su Nantian would lead these bystanders to victory.

Su Nantian clearly saw the situation: volleyball requires at least six players, not counting substitutes or libero. Besides himself and those twin brothers, he couldn’t find anyone else skilled in volleyball.

And the three people who had stood up were also losing confidence and enthusiasm due to Chen Ping’s disdain.

Frustrated, but with Su Nantian there, even a broken pot could become gold.

“I think the three of you are great. You have some understanding of volleyball and love this class. You’re all unique.” Su Nantian broke the deadlock.

The three people were stunned and looked at Su Nantian with gratitude, then continued: “Thank you for your contribution to the class. Join the volleyball team and become a member. I know you all love this class.”

This statement caused热烈 applause from the formation. The three people were overwhelmed and looked back at the students, their determination returning.

Su Nantian added fire at the right moment: “Also, the two brothers from Gao’s family. I believe your love for the class won’t be less than anyone else, and you’ll be the backbone of the volleyball team. I believe with your presence, our class will definitely win this honor.”

The Gao brothers hadn’t expected Su Nantian to praise them as well, and they were secretly excited. They both enjoyed the students’ applause.

At this moment, the whistle blew again on the field. The instructor immediately said: “The volleyball team is set. It’s up to you, Su Nantian. Students, disband!”

The field echoed with shouts again as students scattered to do their own things.

Su Nantian, however, stayed with the newly selected volleyball players to get to know each other. The most important thing in volleyball is team chemistry, and Su Nantian planned to have lunch at the cafeteria together to foster friendship.

But before they had taken a few steps, they were blocked by a small figure approaching them.

“Su Nantian, you promised to let me treat you to lunch.” Su Nantian looked down at Cao Yun and frowned. When had he promised?
