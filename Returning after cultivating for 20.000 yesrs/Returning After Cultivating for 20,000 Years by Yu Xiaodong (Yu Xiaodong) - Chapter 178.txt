“Just now, these security personnel became toothless tigers, incapable of posing any threat.”

“What are you doing?”

This action had occurred so swiftly that no one could react in time. Even those present hadn’t fully grasped how the scene had unfolded.

When they finally regained their composure, Su Nantian already held their weapons in his hands and raised a gun to them.

Nangong Yuyan was the first to recover, her voice sharp with accusation: “What are you doing?” Her eyes flickered with tension as she asked, “What exactly do you intend to do?”

“Lower your gun!”

Nangong Ping also appeared flustered, never expecting Su Nantian to launch such a sudden attack.

“I don’t wish to resort to violence if you cooperate. Tell me what you know about Su Nantian—what did he do, and why is he dead?”

Su Nantian had initially planned to reason with them gently, seeking information through softer methods. But seeing their refusal to cooperate, he had no choice but to resort to these measures.

There was no alternative; he needed answers about his identity. If they proved harmless and devoid of conflict or grudges, Su Nantian would let them go.

“You!”

Nangong Ping and Yuyan glared at Su Nantian upon hearing his words, their expressions filled with indignation.

“Despicable!”

Yuyan cursed Su Nantian under her breath, while Nangong Ping wore a face of outrage—clearly agreeing with his sister’s sentiment.

Yet Su Nantian cared little for their judgments, and their insults were harmless, failing to provoke real discomfort.

Moreover, was this tactic truly despicable? At most, it was a case of “the end justifying the means.”

After all, it was Nangong Yuyan’s side who had first drawn weapons. Su Nantian could only claim self-defense. As for their subordinates failing to control their arms, that was their own fault—what could they complain about?

Chapter 889: Interrogation

“Speak up. Tell me everything. My patience is limited, and I’m not joking!”

After uttering these words, Su Nantian acted decisively. He fired a shot at the ground before Nangong Ping, mere centimeters from his feet. The dust kicked up landed on Nangong Ping’s shoes.

“Hiss—”

No one had expected Su Nantian to act so swiftly, nor with such resolve.

Nangong Ping and Yuyan were both startled, especially when the bullet exploded near Nangong Ping’s feet. He nearly leaped in fear.

“My patience is limited. This was a warning. If you don’t provide the answers I seek, my next shot won’t miss.”

The implication was clear—Su Nantian would aim for either Nangong Ping or Yuyan.

“You!”

Both siblings glared at Su Nantian, but their anger was stifled by the weapon in his hand. They dared not utter another word of resistance.

At that moment, they were at the mercy of the situation. Moreover, considering how Su Nantian had seized all their weapons, they felt even more resentment.

Yet despite their anger, they could only comply with Su Nantian’s demands and reveal what they knew.

Thus, under reluctant circumstances, Su Nantian learned about his past.

From their words, he discovered that his role as a bodyguard in the Nangong family had been a facade—meant to conceal his true purpose.

He also learned that he had remained hidden within the Nangong family all along, aiming to approach the Wu clan. His goal had been to rescue Wu You’er.

Unfortunately, something unforeseen had occurred. Wu You’er died, and Wu Chuan was killed by Su Nantian. Ultimately, Su Nantian himself had been betrayed and killed by Wu family servants. That was how it ended.

“We’ve told you everything we know. But we don’t understand why Su Nantian wanted to save Wu You’er, nor do we know their feud.”

After speaking, Yuyan added: “All of this was kept secret from us at the time.”

After relaying the information, Yuyan’s expression was filled with anger—her compliance was forced.

“Now that you’ve heard everything, can you let us go?”

Yuyan clenched her fists, glaring at Su Nantian with frustration.

This man had inexplicably entered their family and threatened them, then spoke such words—truly infuriating.

At this moment, Yuyan longed to drive Su Nantian away immediately.

“Is that all you know?”

Upon hearing their words, Su Nantian furrowed his brows but committed their statements to memory.

At the same time, he felt an endless sense of confusion.

He still hadn’t unraveled his identity, but from their words, he realized he had likely concealed it from them as well.

Moreover, they spoke of him as if he were already dead.

Upon this realization, Su Nantian’s expression grew even more enigmatic, unreadable to those around him.

“By the way, what’s your relationship with Su Nantian? Why are you asking about him?”

Yuyan furrowed her brows, scrutinizing Su Nantian before asking hesitantly: “Are you his enemy? His friend?”

She had yet to receive an answer, so she began speculating. Each guess prompted her to glance at Su Nantian, hoping to discern his intent from his expression.

But Su Nantian was lost in thought, and Yuyan’s speculations failed to reveal his true purpose.

“Have you told me everything?”

Su Nantian suppressed his thoughts and met Yuyan’s gaze again, pressing further.

“You’ve already pointed a gun at us. How dare we lie?” Yuyan replied, her voice tinged with委屈 (resentment). “I’ve told you everything. Besides, what would we have to hide?”

Yuyan’s voice carried a hint of委屈. She thought back to how he had manipulated her before, and she still felt bitter about being outwitted.

But now that Su Nantian was dead, she could do nothing but endure.

“You’d dare lie to me?”

Upon hearing Yuyan’s words, Su Nantian scrutinized her and Nangong Ping carefully. Seeing their expressions were genuine, he nodded in satisfaction before收回 (retracting) his gaze.

Then he warned: “Remember, whatever I’ve asked tonight—don’t let a single word slip out.”

“Otherwise, you’ll regret it.”

He paused before adding another warning.

Until he uncovered the truth, Su Nantian had no interest in dealing with more matters.

But what was his true identity? Why did he conceal it so thoroughly, even refusing to reveal his face?

The more he thought about it, the more questions arose. What had once been a few scattered doubts now felt like an ever-growing mountain of mysteries.

And before he could resolve these uncertainties, new problems had piled up—each layer revealing another hidden net.

So many truths awaited Su Nantian’s discovery, yet he had no idea how to confirm his identity.

Who am I?

A look of bewilderment crossed Su Nantian’s face, and his hands clenched tightly.

“Understood. We won’t spread lies.”

After all, they had plenty to deal with now. Their immediate priority was elevating the Nangong family—there was no time to concern themselves with Su Nantian’s inquiries that night.

“Now that we’ve cooperated and told you everything, can you let us go?”

Chapter 890: Returning Home

Yuyan spoke again to Su Nantian: “You can’t renege on your word and break your promise, can you?”

In truth, she lacked confidence in saying this. After all, the weapons were now in Su Nantian’s hands, and he appeared no easy opponent.

If he suddenly attacked, they had no defense. So Yuyan could only gamble.

“Of course.”

Upon hearing Yuyan’s words, Su Nantian understood her thoughts and gave a definitive answer.

“I keep my promises.”

With that, Su Nantian tossed his gun aside.

Yuyan and Nangong Ping exchanged a glance, about to order the security personnel to seize Su Nantian—only for him to vanish from their doorway in an instant.

They were left staring at each other, even Yuyan and Nangong Ping unable to comprehend how he had appeared or disappeared.

“Brother, this…?”

Yuyan was bewildered, scanning the area with wide eyes. She searched desperately for Su Nantian’s figure: “Where did he go?”

It was as if he had vanished into thin air, as though he had never existed.

Yuyan was merely frustrated—she hadn’t expected him to appear, manipulate them, and seek his identity. Yet he had proven himself no ordinary person.

“Never mind. Since he’s gone and obtained what he wanted, we’ll leave it be.”

Nangong Ping spoke reluctantly. They had more pressing matters to handle, and no time to dwell on this trivial issue.

As long as he didn’t cause more trouble, they’d be fine.

Yuyan understood why Nangong Ping said this and nodded in agreement.

“Yeah, I’ll listen to you, brother.”

Yet she still harbored some concerns. This man was clearly no easy companion. He had suddenly threatened them with a gun and questioned Su Nantian.

Yuyan didn’t know who this Su Nantian was, why so many people kept searching for him. She also didn’t know why he had wanted to save Wu You’er or why he was at odds with the Wu family.

Yuyan and Nangong Ping suppressed their doubts, unable to find answers. They simply instructed the security personnel to strengthen defenses and prevent such strange people from entering their Nangong family again.

After giving these orders, they turned back to discuss their own pressing matters.

Nothing was more important than the Nangong family’s affairs. If they didn’t resolve these issues quickly, they might be overwhelmed and unable to develop further in the inland port.

The Nangong family members didn’t dwell on this matter or ponder it endlessly—they turned back to their own concerns.

Meanwhile, Su Nantian had arrived at the Nangong family but failed to obtain the information he sought. With no new target, he had no choice but to return temporarily to his small fishing village.

He thought that since Hongye and the Xu family had already fallen, they wouldn’t trouble him anymore. He could return to his small fishing village and stay with the villagers.

Su Nantian knew he often suffered from headaches, which were likely due to fragmented memories. Perhaps after staying a while longer, he would regain his past recollections.

The thought made him even more determined to return to the small fishing village, where he could care for these villagers. If he never remembered his past, it wouldn’t matter—after all, he had found people worth protecting.

After making up his mind, Su Nantian didn’t delay and returned to the small fishing village quickly.

The villagers of the small fishing village had been waiting for Su Nantian’s return.

When he left, they began counting the days on their fingers, wondering how many days he had been away.

Xiaowang had remained at the village entrance all this time, becoming a picturesque sight in the small fishing village.

Now, after waiting so long, they finally saw his familiar figure. Xiaowang immediately jumped up, overjoyed: “Uncle! Uncle, you’re back!”

He had always believed his uncle would return quickly.

Xiaowang was overjoyed, rushing into Su Nantian’s arms and climbing onto him like a monkey. He repeated the same sentence endlessly.

Su Nantian embraced Xiaowang, lifted him slightly, and asked: “Hmm, you’ve gained weight. Have you been eating well?”

Their conversation was ordinary and felt particularly warm.

It was these simple words that created their current sense of kinship.

The villagers of the small fishing village had also been waiting for Su Nantian’s return. Upon hearing Xiaowang’s commotion, they rushed out to check.

Seeing it was indeed the familiar figure, they jumped with joy and surrounded Su Nantian: “You’re finally back, Tian Ge!”

Now that they knew Su Nantian’s abilities, none of them hesitated to address him as “Tian Ge,” regardless of his age.

“Tian Ge! It’s really you! You’re back!”

A familiar voice echoed from the crowd. This voice was identical to Xiaowang’s, filled with joy.

This person was Chen Xiao, who had been jumping and pushing through the crowd to reach Su Nantian. He immediately hugged him: “Tian Ge! I knew you wouldn’t abandon us!”

After Su Nantian left, Chen Xiao had also waited at the village entrance like Xiaowang.

Moreover, since Su Nantian’s departure, their small fishing village had become a place without a doctor again. So Chen Xiao temporarily took over, learning much about herbal medicine from Su Nantian and mastering some simple skills.

He was thus constantly busy.

But now, seeing Su Nantian return, he was overjoyed and teary-eyed.

“Tian Ge! You’re back!”

Chen Xiaoling also stepped out from behind Chen Xiao, her eyes reddening upon seeing Su Nantian. She was both moved and excited.

They were like Su Nantian’s true family, waiting for him to return, and each of them genuinely cared about Su Nantian.

Chapter 891: Peace

They quickly and thoroughly examined Su Nantian, ensuring he had no injuries before sighing in relief.

Su Nantian’s return had caused the entire small fishing village to erupt with excitement.

Everyone stopped their tasks, no one had the heart to busy themselves. The village head led them in hosting a welcome feast for Su Nantian.

They also held a bonfire party at night, which continued until dawn when the flames gradually died out.

Su Nantian knew they were happy to see him back and didn’t want to spoil the mood. He stayed with them, celebrating until it was almost morning before saying goodbye.

Su Nantian returned to his familiar place—Wang Shu’s home.

Wang Shu leaned against the doorframe, his eyes brightening upon seeing Su Nantian: “You’re back?”

Wang Shu spoke softly, as usual. It was as if they had never been apart, as if Su Nantian had simply gone to check on others and returned with the most familiar greeting.

“Yeah.”

Su Nantian didn’t remember his past memories or whether he had parents. But he had come to regard Wang Shu as a true elder.

Seeing Wang Shu now, his emotions were inevitably stirred.

Su Nantian nodded and responded politely, then smiled: “Uncle, I might have to trouble you again.”

This was still the familiar place Su Nantian loved most.

“Come in quickly.”

Upon hearing this, Wang Shu was momentarily choked up and stepped aside to let Su Nantian in.

Su Nantian walked into his familiar room, noticing that it was still spotless despite him being away for half a month. The bed was neatly made, clearly showing that Wang Shu had taken care of it regularly.

“Your things haven’t been touched. Xiaowang comes to check your room every day before sleeping.”

The “little thing” Wang Shu referred to was Xiaowang.

Wang Shu noticed Su Nantian’s gaze and added gently: “The sun was good yesterday, so I took it out to air. You can sleep directly.”

“Thank you, Uncle.”

Though thanking was a strange gesture, Su Nantian could only say this to Wang Shu. He didn’t know what else to say.

These words were heartfelt from Su Nantian.

“Enough, don’t talk about it. You’ve been busy for so many days; you must be exhausted. Go to sleep.”

Wang Shu shook his head, looking at Su Nantian with tolerance and urged him to sleep. He treated Su Nantian like a true younger relative, showing great care.

“Uncle, can I sleep with you?”

Xiaowang walked to Su Nantian’s door holding his small pillow, hesitatingly asking with hopeful eyes.

Children’s eyes were naturally bright, and Xiaowang’s large eyes made him look like twinkling stars. He was incredibly adorable.

“You didn’t finish the story you told me last time, and I want to hear it.”

Xiaowang spoke with childish innocence, his expression filled with anticipation.

Before Su Nantian could respond, Wang Shu interrupted: “Enough, your uncle has been busy outside for so long. Don’t bother him tonight; let him rest.”

Xiaowang nodded obediently upon hearing Wang Shu’s words: “Okay then.”

His expression of anticipation gradually turned into disappointment.

But Xiaowang was still well-behaved and obedient. He worried that continuing to bother Su Nantian would cause trouble, so he was very polite and hugged his pillow to return to his room.

“Haha, come here.”

At this moment, Su Nantian smiled and patted the space beside his bed, indicating for Xiaowang to come in.

Upon seeing this gesture, Xiaowang’s eyes widened immediately, and his hope was rekindled. His eyes became even brighter.

“Is it okay with you, Grandpa?”

Xiaowang asked Wang Shu’s opinion, looking up at him with great expectation.

“It’s fine; I’m used to it.”

Su Nantian shook his head at Wang Shu, telling him not to refuse Xiaowang.

Upon seeing both of them say this, Wang Shu said nothing more but gave a warning: to Xiaowang not to bother Su Nantian and to Su Nantian to sleep early.

In fact, after returning to the small fishing village, Su Nantian had noticed changes in his body. He could have rested without sleeping for hours; a two-hour meditation would restore all his energy, and he wouldn’t feel tired at all.

So even if he stayed up all night, he would feel no fatigue. But Xiaowang had been looking forward to him for so many days.

Su Nantian naturally didn’t mind making Xiaowang happy.

Indeed, upon hearing Wang Shu’s approval, Su Nantian patted his bed again. Xiaowang immediately grinned and showed two big white teeth.

“Uncle, you’re the best!”

Xiaowang ran over happily and hugged Su Nantian’s neck, saying sweetly.

He loved this uncle the most and preferred to stay with him. It felt safe with Su Nantian, a feeling he had never experienced before.

During the days Su Nantian was away, Xiaowang had missed him greatly.

Xiaowang also worried that Su Nantian would leave like his parents and never return.

But Su Nantian had kept his promise and returned to the small fishing village.

Only now, truly hugging Su Nantian, did Xiaowang believe he had returned.

So at this moment, Xiaowang was truly happy and longed to be with Su Nantian.

Su Nantian knew Xiaowang was happy to see him, so he said nothing but patted the pillow and let Xiaowang lie beside him. Then he asked: “Where did I leave off with the story last time?”

“Uncle, you left off when the little tiger went on an adventure!”

Xiaowang quickly told Su Nantian and looked up expectantly for the next part.

Su Nantian nodded with a smile and continued: “Well, this little tiger…”

Xiaowang was just a child. Even though he was happy to see Su Nantian, his energy was high, but after a short while, he fell asleep soundly.

Chapter 892: An Unexpected Event

“Haha, this little troublemaker.”

Su Nantian chuckled and looked at Xiaowang with affection.

He thought about how Xiaowang had always begged to hear this bedtime story, yet he still hadn’t finished it after so many times.

Su Nantian shook his head in无奈 (helplessness), gently tucking Xiaowang’s blanket and patting his round little head. He didn’t know that this night of peace would not return for a long time.

Then Su Nantian sat cross-legged to meditate and regulate his energy.

These days had been spent traveling outside without time to rest and meditate properly.

Returning here was more convenient, and Su Nantian had noticed that the spiritual energy here was much richer than outside, completely undeveloped.

Su Nantian didn’t need to compete with anyone to absorb the surrounding spiritual energy; just half an hour of meditation restored all his energy without any fatigue.

He tucked Xiaowang’s blanket again and then stepped out, slowly heading to the backyard.

Although he hadn’t lived here for long, Su Nantian felt this place was the most peaceful and calming. It helped him settle his thoughts, unlike outside where he felt restless.

After returning, Su Nantian’s life remained unchanged—he worked as a doctor in the small fishing village and occasionally taught villagers to identify herbs and precious medicinal plants.

Of course, he also warned them not to over-exploit resources or be blinded by immediate gains and dig up treasures for future generations.

Moreover, Su Nantian began teaching them to cultivate certain plants artificially.

The villagers were naturally honest and straightforward, and since they followed Su Nantian’s lead, they all obeyed his instructions. Upon hearing his words, they had no objections and actively protected the surrounding forests of the small fishing village.

Seeing them voluntarily protect the area, Su Nantian liked them even more and felt he hadn’t made a mistake in choosing them.

At that time, Su Nantian believed he would live quietly in the small fishing village until he regained his memories. He and these villagers would live happily together, unaware that human calculations could never match heaven’s plans.

You never know what tomorrow holds until it arrives.

Soon, their peaceful life would be shattered by force, leaving no room for resistance.

The weather was as usual—clear and cloudless.

Su Nantian accompanied Chen Xiao and Chen Xiaoling to go mountain foraging as usual.

He thought that once he regained his memories, he wouldn’t stay here long. So he wanted to find a successor now, ensuring they could care for the villagers after him.

Chen Xiao and Chen Xiaoling were his chosen candidates. They wholeheartedly served the small fishing village, so they wouldn’t refuse. They diligently followed Su Nantian’s teachings.

At this moment, Su Nantian led them out to forage. They carefully recorded and took photos of the herbs’ uses, preserving this knowledge so they could quickly identify them later.

Seeing their dedication to learning, Su Nantian was even more satisfied.

He continued teaching Chen Xiaoling and others about new herbs, guiding them to distinguish their effects and applications.

They lived in peace, unaware that the small fishing village had undergone a complete transformation, and everyone was taken over by intruders.

At this time, a group of people in black clothes stormed into the small fishing village, breaking their peace.

These people’s origins were unknown, but they acted arrogantly and brutally, giving the villagers no time to prepare.

Their actions were ruthless; they dragged everyone out without exception.

“Not this one, too old. Not this one either.”

They wore black clothes and masks covering their faces, hiding all features so no one could recognize them.

At this moment, they had dragged out the villagers and focused on the children, comparing each one as if searching for someone.

These children had lived in a peaceful environment and hadn’t experienced such brutality before. They were frightened when dragged out, trembling constantly.

Some younger children even started crying.

“Be quiet! Don’t make noise!”

They showed no sympathy, and upon seeing the children crying, they scolded them. Seeing them still distressed, they slapped one child across the face without mercy.

After slapping and warning the children, they continued comparing them one by one, clearly with ill intentions.

“This isn’t right either; too young.”

They frowned as they compared each child, acting roughly by grabbing their collars and pushing them aside.

“Who are you? What do you want?”

The village head was also dragged out and saw their focus on the children, constantly comparing them as if searching for someone. He immediately questioned them: “Don’t do this recklessly.”

“Who are you to ask? Let your old bones stay out of it!”

The leader of the group coldly scolded the village head, showing no respect. He seemed to have completely forgotten the concept of respecting elders.

Their words were harsh, and their actions were even more so. They showed no respect towards the village head or others.

When someone tried to speak, they pushed the village head aside.

“Old man! If you don’t want to die, shut up. Otherwise, I’ll kill you and send you off early!”

Their words were extremely crude, leaving no room for dignity. There was even a hint of provocation in their tone.

Chapter 893: Black-Cloaked Men

“You!”

Upon hearing their words, the village head turned red with anger.

“What are you talking about? He’s our village head! You should show some respect!”

Another young man, unable to tolerate their treatment of the elderly and especially their respected village head, stepped forward to interrupt them. He supported the village head behind him.

“Village head?”

Upon hearing the village head’s identity, these men raised their eyebrows with interest but didn’t change their attitude toward him. Instead, they laughed: “Fine. Since you’re the village head, you must know your village’s situation. Bring out all children aged six to ten—no one should be left behind.”

After saying this, the leader of the group threatened the village head again, clearly urging him to cooperate quickly.

“I don’t know.”

The village head knew these people had ill intentions, so he resolutely refused to tell them anything.

“Don’t know? Then you’re of no use!”

These people were equally despicable. Upon seeing the village head’s refusal, they kicked him.

The village head was old and frail; he couldn’t withstand their treatment. He usually walked with a cane, moving slowly. Now, after being kicked, he fell to the ground immediately.

Their actions were so sudden that the villagers hadn’t reacted in time.

When they finally regained their composure, the village head had already fallen.

“Village head! Are you okay?”

The villagers rushed to help him up, worrying about his condition.

“Don’t you know he’s an elder?”

Other villagers couldn’t bear it and scolded them, pointing out their behavior.

“Do you know he’s an elder? Then you’re not one either!”

At this moment, the man sneered and kicked the villager who had spoken up. Their behavior was truly despicable, showing no mercy at all.

In their minds, it seemed they had never learned the meaning of respect.

“Despicable!”

The villagers wanted to resist, but the black-cloaked men had already sensed their intention. They immediately pulled out weapons—these people were the same as those who had previously caused trouble, carrying hard weapons like guns.

These weren’t things the villagers could fight against.

“Stay quiet! Don’t make a noise, or you’ll get shot!”

The man scowled and reprimanded them. He looked down on these villagers.

The villagers had initially wanted to unite and resist, but now that they saw the weapons, they fell silent immediately. They dared not say another word.

After all, one wrong move could cost them their lives. It was better to cooperate for now and find a way out.

“Cooperate quickly and bring the children out. If any family has kids, hand them over as soon as possible; otherwise, when we find them, it’ll be too late!”

The leader of the black-cloaked men continued to threaten the villagers, speaking with a harsh tone.

“Hurry up! Our patience is limited. If you don’t cooperate quickly, your lives will be at risk.”

The black-cloaked men continued to threaten the villagers, their attitude becoming even more arrogant. They showed no respect for them at all.

The children were terrified by this scene, their usual lively spirits gone. They just cried and screamed, which naturally annoyed the black-cloaked men. They scolded the children directly, implying they would teach them a lesson if they continued crying.

The villagers had already seen these people’s cruelty and realized they wouldn’t be gentle with the children.

So, the villagers quickly comforted the crying children, fearing they would be punished by the black-cloaked men.

“Hmph! You’re finally cooperating, I see.”

Upon seeing the villagers calming the children’s emotions, the black-cloaked men nodded in satisfaction. But they quickly became impatient again: “Hurry up and bring out all the children in your village! This is still not enough.”
