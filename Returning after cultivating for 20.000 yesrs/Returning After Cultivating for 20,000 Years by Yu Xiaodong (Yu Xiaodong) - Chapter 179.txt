They spoke as they observed the children being brought forth, comparing each one to their target. Yet none matched, and so they withdrew their hands in disappointment, their demeanor growing even more hostile.

"What do you want with the child?" one of the villagers finally asked, their concern evident. They could not fathom what these strangers intended.

They also sensed the men's ill intent, deepening their worry.

"You dare question us? Just find the child quickly!" The black-cloaked men, upon hearing the villagers' words, shot them a scornful glance and maintained their arrogant attitude.

After being scolded and threatened, the villagers fell silent, no one daring to speak.

At this point, all the children of the small fishing village had gathered—except for Xiao Wang from Uncle Wang's household.

Of course, the villagers would not expose Xiao Wang. They prayed silently that he would not emerge or be discovered.

They had already suffered enough; there was no need to involve more innocent people.

The village elder, injured by kicks, was now breathing heavily, his condition dire.

Seeing the elder's plight, the villagers felt immense sorrow and hurried to comfort him: "Elder, please hold on! Master Tian has gone out with Xiao Chen to gather herbs. He'll return soon. Once he comes, we'll be saved."

They had come to regard Su Nantian as their divine protector and placed immense trust in him. Thus, they now pinned all their hopes on his return.

The elder had witnessed Su Nantian's prowess and, like the others, believed that with him present, their safety was assured. Upon hearing these words, he nodded immediately and resolved to wait for Su Nantian's return.

"Stop your muttering! Be quiet!" Hearing their murmurs, the black-cloaked men barked again in frustration.

"What's going on? Don't you understand human speech? Find the child quickly, or do you prefer to be punished?" The leader's patience had worn thin. He scowled at the villagers.

Chapter 894: The Rebellion Begins

"We've received intelligence that the child is among you. Don't think you can deceive us!" The villagers exchanged glances, bewildered and puzzled upon hearing these words.

They were all natives of the village, intimately familiar with its children. Besides Xiao Wang, no other child was missing.

If they were to believe them, then Xiao Wang must be the one they sought. Yet naturally, these people would not betray Xiao Wang.

"All the children are here. I don't know who you're looking for," one villager finally said, determined to stick to this answer.

The others nodded in agreement: "Indeed, our village has few children. These are all here. What exactly do you want?"

As long as their target was not among these children, they would be safe. And Xiao Wang's danger was undeniable; thus, they would never betray him.

"Everyone is here. That can't be right?" The leader frowned, pulled out his phone to check, and carefully compared the children. He confirmed there was no one matching their target.

"Understand this: don't try to trick me. If I discover you're lying, you'll regret it!" He warned the villagers again, urging them to cooperate.

As long as they hadn't found the child, the villagers would definitely deny it and never reveal the truth. They were united in their resolve, never betraying anyone.

Moreover, they hoped that since the situation was already dire and if they held out until Su Nantian returned, there would be no further trouble. Thus, they were even less likely to betray Xiao Wang.

"We truly don't know your purpose, but our village's children are all present," the villagers reiterated unanimously. One child was missing—Xiao Wang. The others, usually mischievous, were unusually quiet today, not uttering Xiao Wang's name.

"Did we really miss him?" The leader frowned, looking troubled.

The villagers also wore faint smiles of relief. They knew that if they remained silent and obedient, they would not be discovered.

If these people failed to find the child, they would stop troubling them and leave on their own.

"Master! I found him! I've found the child!" Suddenly, a black-cloaked man emerged from the village. The child he held was clearly Xiao Wang.

"Let me go! Let me go! You bastard!" Xiao Wang struggled and fought back, kicking the man who held him.

The man, however, was not fazed by a child's resistance. Xiao Wang's kicks were as harmless as feathers to him, and he continued carrying the boy effortlessly toward his leader.

"Master! This is the child we sought! He's clever, hiding at home!" The man spoke with resentment, his gaze toward Xiao Wang laced with disdain.

Had they not been alert today, they would have wasted time and returned empty-handed!

"Strip him and check thoroughly," the leader ordered, his face dark with anger. He glared at the villagers, knowing they had lied.

"You dare deceive me?" He spat a harsh remark before issuing orders to his men: "Confirm it's this child. No mistakes allowed!"

"Right, Master! Look at his back—seven red moles. It's definitely him!" The subordinate obeyed immediately, lifting Xiao Wang's clothes to reveal his back. "Master, it's him! We won't mistake him!"

"Ha! At last, the long search has paid off!" The leader's face lit up with joy upon confirming the seven red moles on Xiao Wang's back. He was overjoyed.

They had not come in vain this time.

"Hmph! You dare deceive me? I'll teach you a lesson!" After resolving the matter, the leader had time to deal with the villagers of the small fishing village.

"Let go of Xiao Wang! Quickly!" At this moment, Uncle Wang rushed out tremblingly. He had been kicked earlier while protecting Xiao Wang and only just regained his composure.

As soon as he recovered, he hurried out, fearing something would happen to Xiao Wang. Seeing him in their grasp, Uncle Wang immediately warned them: "Let go of Xiao Wang!"

"Grandpa!" Xiao Wang cried out upon seeing Uncle Wang. "Grandpa! Save me! Hurry and save me!" Even though he was clever, Xiao Wang was still a child. Especially now, held by these strange black-cloaked men who looked unapproachable, he was terrified. His voice trembled with fear as he sought Uncle Wang's help.

The villagers had raised Xiao Wang. Seeing him so frightened, they all spoke up: "What do you want? Let go of Xiao Wang! Why trouble a child?"

These people were truly overstepping!

"Let him go? This is my master's mission. I've searched for years. Do you think I'd let go of him because of your words?" The leader sneered, having achieved a great feat. He had waited years for this moment, nearly losing his master's favor due to Xiao Wang's absence. He had been criticized countless times for this. Now, finally finding him, he could regain his dignity. Naturally, he would not let Xiao Wang go.

"Bind him and take him away!" After saying this, the black-cloaked man gave an arrogant order. He paid no heed to the villagers' resistance, seemingly indifferent to their emotions.

Moreover, they seemed to be taunting the villagers, playing with them.

Chapter 895: Disaster Strikes

"Let go of Xiao Wang! Quickly!" Uncle Wang could not allow them to take Xiao Wang. He rushed forward immediately, trying to reclaim him.

Seeing Uncle Wang's actions, the other villagers also stood up, rushing to help. They could not let these people take Xiao Wang without resistance. After all, Xiao Wang was their village's child; they could not let them take him without reason.

They did not know where these people were taking Xiao Wang. If it caused trouble, that would be bad.

Moreover, the villagers were united in their resolve. In this situation, they felt they must unite and protect themselves from being trampled upon.

"Quickly! Be efficient! Make sure to eradicate all traces, leaving no survivors!" The black-cloaked man ordered again, his expression cruel and merciless. He believed in doing things thoroughly, ensuring no one survived.

After that, they could not leave any problems behind.

"What?" The villagers were frightened upon hearing the black-cloaked man's words. But soon, they regained their resolve, determined not to fear them.

"Understood, Master!" Others had already been impatient. They felt these villagers were a nuisance. Upon hearing the leader's order, they did not hesitate and immediately acted. These people were ruthless, killing villagers without mercy.

They enjoyed this game of slaughter, discussing their "achievements" afterward as if it were something to be proud of.

"Haha, I've killed five," one said.

"Cut it out. I've already killed eleven!" another replied.

They were happy discussing this, treating the act as a game.

"Hey! That's my prey! Don't interfere!" Some even started arguing, firing shots one after another.

"Ah! Ah!" The villagers who were shot cried out, unable to say a word before collapsing. Blood spurted from their wounds.

The scent of blood quickly spread, hanging over the small fishing village. The entire village was shrouded in a gloom.

"Ah! They've started! They really have!" The villagers who were not shot had not expected these people to act seriously. Upon witnessing this, they all screamed in fear.

The villagers who were killed lay on the ground without strength to rise again. This horrifying and bloody scene gave the villagers a strong visual impact, making each one feel terrified and uneasy.

"Oh my God! You... you actually killed them!"

"Are you even human? How could you kill people like that?" The villagers stared in disbelief, unable to accept this terrible scene.

"Hmph! Human?" These black-cloaked men heard the villagers' words and only sneered, as if enjoying a game. "We killed you!"

After saying this, the black-cloaked man raised his hand and shot another innocent villager.

"You...," seeing their mercilessness and cruel methods, the villagers were again startled. But soon, upon seeing one villager after another fall, they shouted loudly: "We'll fight back!"

These were their neighbors and friends. They had lived together for years, forming a bond as close as family. Now seeing them killed, the other villagers felt unbearable pain.

Thus, they all rushed forward to avenge their comrades and stop these cruel murderers. However, they were unarmed and had no training. These people came prepared with deadly weapons.

Although the villagers outnumbered them, they had no chance in terms of weaponry.

Indeed!

These black-cloaked men showed no mercy, killing one after another.

Even they cruelly killed other children. It seemed that besides Xiao Wang, no one else needed to be left alive.

The remaining villagers were completely numb, too terrified to make a sound. They only resisted desperately, trying to drive these people out of their small fishing village.

Xiao Wang was captured. Though he was young and did not know what death meant, seeing these people attack his familiar uncles and elders, he struggled even more fiercely.

"Let me go! Don't hurt them!" Xiao Wang shouted angrily, biting the person who held him.

"Agh!" The man was unprepared and immediately changed his face after being bitten by Xiao Wang.

"Damn it!" At this moment, Xiao Wang tried to run toward the villagers but was quickly lifted by the black-cloaked man.

"Damn fool! If it weren't for my master's orders to keep your life, I would have killed you!" The man gritted his teeth and spoke. However, he soon thought of the possibility of Xiao Wang being taken back and smiled with a terrifying expression.

He sneered coldly at Xiao Wang, his eyes filled with mockery: "Now you can run and make a fuss. But later, you won't have such good treatment!"

The black-cloaked man said again: "Enjoy it while you can!"

Chapter 896: Collective Resistance

Xiao Wang trembled from the man's gaze and words, though he did not know what awaited him. He was terrified.

"Let me go! Let me go! Grandpa! Uncle!" Xiao Wang continued to struggle, shouting for Uncle Wang and Su Nantian, hoping they would come to save him.

At this moment, a young man who had noticed something was wrong slipped away while the black-cloaked men were checking the child. He ran up the mountain quickly, intending to find Su Nantian.

Upon hearing the gunshots behind him, his face froze.

The young man shivered involuntarily and ran faster.

"They've opened fire! They've shot!" The young man was terrified, wishing he had wings to fly and find Su Nantian quickly.

He shouted as he ran up the mountain, desperate to find Su Nantian.

Meanwhile, Su Nantian, who was teaching Xiao Chen and Chen Xiaoling to identify herbs, heard the gunshots due to his keen hearing.

Gunshots?

Su Nantian stood up instantly, dropping the herbs in his hand. His face turned serious in an instant.

Why were there gunshots now?

Su Nantian's confusion deepened, his expression more serious. What was going on?

Chen Xiaoling and the others had much poorer hearing than Su Nantian, so they did not know what was happening. They only saw Su Nantian stand up immediately.

They were startled and asked: "What's wrong, Master Tian? What happened?"

As they asked, they looked at each other in confusion and bewilderment.

"There are gunshots. The direction is the village," Su Nantian answered immediately without further explanation.

But this sentence was like a thunderclap in the spring night, startling everyone.

Upon hearing Su Nantian's words, Chen Xiaoling and others widened their eyes in disbelief: "What? There are gunshots? In the village? That's impossible!"

Their small fishing village was honest and simple, even lacking hunting guns.

"Yes, there are gunshots," Su Nantian confirmed again after carefully identifying them. He was certain it was the direction of the small fishing village.

"Really? There are gunshots? Could something have happened in the village?" Xiao Chen and Chen Xiaoling looked surprised. After regaining their composure, they all ran back to check what had happened.

They met the young man who came to warn them at that moment.

"Master Tian! Master Tian! I'm glad I found you." The young man saw Su Nantian and immediately felt relieved. However, he soon shouted anxiously: "It's bad! Master Tian! Something big has happened in the village!"

"What's going on? Tell me clearly!" Su Nantian, seeing the young man's urgency, supported him and asked about the situation immediately.

The young man knew the gravity of the situation. Seeing Su Nantian, he felt like he had found his anchor. However, recalling the scene before him, he was still very nervous.

He took a deep breath to calm his nerves and quickly told Su Nantian: "It's bad. Suddenly, a group of strange people came. They were odd and then entered our small fishing village. They demanded all the children be taken out."

As he spoke, the young man took deep breaths: "I saw something was wrong and immediately came to find Master Tian. What should we do now?"

The young man was desperate, especially after hearing the gunshots. He felt something was wrong and did not dare to delay, rushing over to inform Su Nantian.

Who could be so arrogant? Xiao Cheng immediately replied with anger. "Master Tian, let's go back and deal with them!" Su Nantian nodded immediately.

"You did well," Su Nantian gave a confirming answer. Fortunately, this young man was clever and came to inform him immediately: "Let's go back now. Let's see who these people are!"

Su Nantian spoke seriously and confidently, which made the others who were anxious feel a little more at ease. It seemed that with Su Nantian present, they could find confidence.

"But Master Tian, these people are really strange. I've never seen them before!" After finding Su Nantian, the young man felt a little calmer. When people relaxed, they talked more. As they walked, the young man asked Su Nantian.

"Let's talk about it later," Su Nantian shook his head. He had no time to continue this conversation.

No matter who these people were, he would not let them harm the peace of the small fishing village. Once back, he would deal with these audacious people immediately.

But as Su Nantian heard more gunshots, his heart grew more anxious. Moreover, even Su Nantian could not stay calm at this moment. Others initially spoke, and Xiao Chen would ask the young man about the details.

But as they got closer, the gunshots grew louder. Their expressions became more solemn and no one had the mood to explain.

"Damn it!" Su Nantian cursed under his breath, his expression dark. He clenched his fists. At this moment, he no longer cared about Xiao Chen and the others. He immediately channeled his spiritual energy and vanished before their eyes.

Su Nantian had used his spiritual power to return as quickly as possible, but it was too late to prevent the tragic outcome. By this time, it was already too late; the villagers of the small fishing village had all been shot down.

The casualties were severe, and even the children lay in blood pools. No one had been lucky enough to escape death.

Except for Xiao Wang, who was captured, everyone else had been shot.

Su Nantian remembered the color of this land. It was once fertile black soil! But now, it had been stained red by the villagers' blood!

Moreover, a pungent scent of blood surrounded the small fishing village.

"Damn it! Stop! You scum, stop!" Upon seeing them shoot Uncle Wang, Su Nantian shouted and rushed over to save him and the other villagers.

Chapter 897: Uncle Wang

"No!" Su Nantian cried out, for the first time feeling his voice was no longer his own. "Damn it! You scum!"

But Su Nantian was too late, missing his chance by a step. He could only watch helplessly as these black-cloaked men attacked Uncle Wang and the others.

At this moment, Uncle Wang had already been shot. The few remaining villagers cried out and fell to the ground.

"What is this person?" These black-cloaked men had been dealing with things smoothly, but they hadn't expected Su Nantian to descend from the sky. They didn't know who Su Nantian was and looked at each other in confusion.

"Who cares what he is! Just kill him!" Their instincts were sharp. At this moment, they didn't care about Su Nantian's identity; he couldn't be left alive. Otherwise, there would be danger.

This view was unanimously agreed upon by all the black-cloaked men. They picked up their guns and aimed at Su Nantian, intending to shoot him full of holes.

Upon sensing their actions, Su Nantian frowned and created an air barrier to block all the bullets aimed at him.

After this action, Su Nantian rushed toward the villagers lying in blood pools.

"Uncle Li? Uncle Chen?" Su Nantian asked one by one, but these villagers had already died. No one could answer him.

"Nantian..." At this moment, a weak voice rang out and pulled Su Nantian back from his sorrow. He quickly looked up, seeing the weak Uncle Wang.

"Uncle Wang!" Su Nantian rushed to support him, placing his head on his lap and asking anxiously: "Uncle Wang, how are you? Are you okay?"

Su Nantian had never imagined that merely taking Xiao Chen and others to identify herbs would result in such a disaster. It was normal behavior for the village. If he had known, he would have never left his side and would have protected these villagers!

But now that the incident had occurred, Su Nantian's regret could not reverse time.

"I'm sorry, Uncle Wang. It's my fault..." Su Nantian looked at Uncle Wang with concern, seeing him shot in the chest and blood gushing out. He quickly pressed his hand on Uncle Wang's wound: "It's okay, Uncle Wang. Don't be afraid. I'll save you. I'll save you right now!"

Su Nantian spoke anxiously, feeling for the first time in his life a sense of fear. He even noticed his body trembling.

These were people he had lived and worked with every day! Seeing their faces, Su Nantian would recall the events he had shared with them. Now seeing them all lying in blood pools, how could Su Nantian bear it?

"Don't be so hard on yourself..." Uncle Wang shook his head weakly, placing his hand over Su Nantian's to stop him. He could feel his strength fading and even his consciousness beginning to disappear.

"Don't worry about me..." Uncle Wang shook his head again, knowing he could not save himself and wanted Su Nantian to stop worrying about him.

"No! Uncle Wang, you'll be okay!" Su Nantian shook his head, disagreeing with Uncle Wang and refusing to let him give up so easily.

"I know my condition. Don't worry about me... Xiao Wang, Xiao Wang..." Uncle Wang shook his head again, using all his strength to hold Su Nantian's hand. In fact, it was just a light squeeze from Uncle Wang.

Uncle Wang's mouth opened and closed, struggling to say Xiao Wang's name. Su Nantian followed Uncle Wang's gaze and saw that Xiao Wang was in the hands of those black-cloaked men. He understood what Uncle Wang was worried about and immediately nodded: "I know, Uncle Wang. I'll save him back. I won't let him fall into their hands."

After calming Uncle Wang's emotions, Su Nantian continued to say: "So Uncle Wang, please hold on. You can't be harmed! I won't let you be harmed either!"

Su Nantian channeled his spiritual energy to Uncle Wang, trying to revive him.

But Uncle Wang's injuries were too severe. Although Su Nantian continuously channeled spiritual energy, it only made Uncle Wang's face slightly better and reduced the pain in his wound. It was merely a temporary fix, unable to save Uncle Wang.

"How could it be! No, I can save you!" Su Nantian felt Uncle Wang's life force gradually fading. He could not accept this answer.

His life had been saved by Uncle Wang. How could he watch Uncle Wang die before his eyes!

No, Su Nantian was not willing. He absolutely could not accept this result.

"Uncle Wang! It won't be!" Su Nantian was like a madman, continuing to channel spiritual energy desperately, trying to revive Uncle Wang. But at this moment, Uncle Wang was like a balloon with a hole. No matter how much spiritual energy Su Nantian channeled, it had no effect and could not revive Uncle Wang.

"Nantian..." At this moment, Uncle Wang shook his head again. He seemed to understand Su Nantian's feelings.

His eyes were gentle, without fear of the approaching death. Instead, he was comforting Su Nantian: "I know you did your best."

Because of the spiritual energy, Uncle Wang's strength had recovered slightly and he was no longer as uncomfortable. Now his only concern was Xiao Wang.

Uncle Wang had always been worried about Xiao Wang, fearing something would happen to him. But now that Su Nantian had returned, Uncle Wang felt he could no longer worry. Upon hearing Su Nantian's words, Uncle Wang even showed a relieved expression.

"I know you will. You'll protect Xiao Wang well." Uncle Wang smiled at Su Nantian, his eyes full of trust and no doubt.

"Nantian, I know you're a good child. You must take care of Xiao Wang and protect him, okay?" Uncle Wang continued to speak these words about Xiao Wang. Combined with his current state, it was like a final testament.

It was definitely an ominous sign!

"Uncle Wang! Enough. Don't speak anymore!" Su Nantian shook his head: "You must conserve your strength. I'll save Xiao Wang, and he won't be harmed. You can't be harmed either!"

Su Nantian insisted on not letting Uncle Wang waste his strength.

Chapter 898: Final Testament

"No, I must speak," Uncle Wang insisted, shaking his head. He smiled at Su Nantian: "I know my condition. If I don't say it now, there'll be no chance."

At this point, Uncle Wang smiled weakly. His eyes carried comfort and instructions for Su Nantian.

"Promise me," Uncle Wang seemed to know that Su Nantian would continue to persuade him. He looked at Su Nantian seriously and this statement was entirely heartfelt. He needed Su Nantian's promise.

"I, know," Su Nantian said. He had wanted Uncle Wang to rest and not speak anymore. But seeing how difficult it was for Uncle Wang to say these words, he knew that Uncle Wang's condition was truly not long for this world.

He had spoken so many words with difficulty, all to seek peace of mind. So Su Nantian fulfilled Uncle Wang's wish and gave him this answer.

Su Nantian also struggled to move his lips, his throat dry as he forced out this sentence: "I promise you, Uncle Wang."

But after saying this simple sentence, Su Nantian felt a suffocating sensation overwhelming him. There was nothing on his neck, yet it seemed like a rope had appeared out of nowhere and tightly strangled him. He could not breathe or escape.

"Good, I'm glad you promised," Uncle Wang smiled contentedly. It seemed the heavy burden on his heart had finally been lifted.

Uncle Wang could now rest easy. He mustered his strength to speak the words he had long kept in his heart.

"Su Nantian, actually Xiao Wang is not my biological grandson." Uncle Wang's words were like a thunderclap in the clear sky, or a stone thrown into calm water. It stirred up a commotion and made Su Nantian's eyes widen, his breath stopping.

But Su Nantian did not ask any irrelevant questions at this moment. He looked seriously at Uncle Wang, waiting for his next words.

Su Nantian knew that Uncle Wang was now at the end of his strength and on his deathbed. Although he did not want to accept this result, he had no choice but to acknowledge it.

Su Nantian did not interrupt himself. Uncle Wang seemed greatly relieved and continued speaking.

At this point, Su Nantian realized that Xiao Wang's real name was not Xiao Wang. He was also not Uncle Wang's biological grandson. He was the grandson of Uncle Wang's former master. Xiao Wang bore a deep blood feud, and Uncle Wang had taken him from his original place under the master's trust. They had come to this isolated small fishing village.

Although Uncle Wang was not a native of the small fishing village, he had lived there for over six years. Because of his personality, he got along well with the villagers. The people had long overcome their differences and accepted Uncle Wang and Xiao Wang in their hearts.

Moreover, the villagers of the small fishing village had kindly accepted them. They did not ask any inappropriate questions but gave their greatest help whenever Uncle Wang and Xiao Wang needed it.

"Su Nantian, when I brought Xiao Wang to this place, I had anticipated this day. These people would never give up easily..." Uncle Wang continued, his face growing more grim with each word.

"I just didn't expect them to find us so quickly," he said, looking at the villagers lying in blood pools beside him. Tears flowed down his face: "In the end, it was me who brought disaster to them. I thought this place was isolated and could hide well. But it seems I still brought trouble to them."

If the previous encounter with Long Ge and A Chuan was a problem Su Nantian had caused, then these people were all after Xiao Wang.
