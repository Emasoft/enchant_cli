At present, Yue Han regarded Su Nantian as a life-saving benefactor. In certain aspects, he would not hesitate to offer minor assistance, and he certainly would not be stingy with his various resources, including his network of contacts.

Since Su Nantian's medical skills were so exceptional that they could be described as "a master of healing," he intended to introduce several influential and powerful patients to Su Nantian. This would not only significantly elevate Su Nantian's social status and help him grow rapidly, but it would also aid his old friends in alleviating their ailments and restoring health—truly a win-win situation. He had already mentally compiled a list of patients Su Nantian would treat next.

Meanwhile, Su Nantian's thoughts differed from Yue Han's. While Yue Han aimed to cultivate connections and elevate Su Nantian's status, integrating him into the upper echelons of society, these superficial matters held no value in Su Nantian's eyes. With his abilities, he could command admiration wherever he went; there was no need to exert effort. The reason Su Nantian had so readily agreed to treat Cheng Feng was due to another hidden motive.

Who was Cheng Feng? The formidable chairman of Fengyuan Mining Group, a man who had spent his life dealing with underground and surface mineral resources. Su Nantian's interest lay precisely in this.

At present, he aimed to elevate the Divine Demon Sword to another level, requiring an immense amount of rare metal ores. Relying solely on scavenging from the Dragon Group's resources would take years to accumulate, so he needed alternative means of obtaining materials. As an internationally renowned mining magnate, Fengyuan maintained mines globally, with countless laborers operating beneath.

Chapter 312: Nothing Is Impossible

Even if a single mine yielded only one rare ore, the accumulated total would be astonishing. Su Nantian had arrived just in time.

If he could cure Cheng Feng's ailments, requesting some metal ores as recompense would be effortless. Even if the resources were not particularly rare, accumulation over time could yield transformation from quantity to quality. Extracting even a few pounds of refined steel from tons of ordinary iron ore would never be a loss.

After conversing with Su Nantian for so long, Yue Han felt drowsy and had just changed his medication, needing to rest thoroughly. Su Nantian gave a few brief instructions to the guards watching over Yue Han, then quietly left the high-temperature room. Unexpectedly, Yang's eldest daughter, Yue Xiaoshan, had been waiting outside the door.

"Xiaoshan... um..."

Upon suddenly seeing such a stunning beauty, staring at him with wide eyes, Su Nantian felt parched and his blood surged. He could barely speak coherently.

Fortunately, Yue Xiaoshan's impatience was even greater. Before he could finish speaking, she grabbed his arm and eagerly asked: "Nantian, how is my father's condition? Is there any life-threatening danger?"

Perhaps the force of her pull was too strong, directly dragging Su Nantian's arm to her chest. Feeling the surprisingly soft texture and pronounced differences, Su Nantian nearly sneezed blood. He hadn't expected that being a doctor would bring such treatment—truly exhilarating.

"Cough, cough. Xiaoshan, don't be too anxious. Let's talk slowly," Su Nantian coughed twice and subtly withdrew his hand. Though he had a thousand reservations, there was no choice—after all, who could be so principled and steadfast?

He never considered himself a good person, but he would never take advantage of someone in distress or exploit their misfortune. He certainly wouldn't seize such a small opportunity.

"Oh, sorry," Yue Xiaoshan realized she had been too impulsive and smiled apologetically. "Nantian, I'm really worried about my father's condition."

"It's fine, Xiaoshan. I understand your feelings," Su Nantian nodded slightly in understanding.

"Ah."

Yue Xiaoshan suddenly sighed deeply, her face lined with sorrow. "He had several episodes at home before. We saw many doctors who said it was old-age illness, incurable. I just want to know if he's in any life-threatening danger and how long he can last."

Yue Han was old, his health had deteriorated significantly. After enduring the cold poison repeatedly, he would have been nearly dead. Yue Xiaoshan's concerns were entirely reasonable.

If Yue Han truly fell, the burden of Xinyue Group would fall solely on Yue Xiaoshan. She was not yet prepared to fully take over, and she needed Yue Han to support her for another two years.

"Xiaoshan, you've misunderstood," Su Nantian rubbed his nose and replied calmly. "Yue Han's current condition is very good, no life-threatening danger. His illness can be completely cured; I don't think he'll live another twenty or thirty years."

"That's impossible!"

After hearing Su Nantian's answer, Yue Xiaoshan's first reaction was disbelief. "Nantian, don't try to comfort me anymore. Tell me the truth; I can handle it."

As Yue Xiaoshan's daughter, she knew her father's condition better than anyone. Before Yue Han fell ill, the family had already consulted numerous domestic and foreign doctors for thorough examinations and comprehensive diagnoses. At that time, they all concluded that Yue Han was too old, his physical functions had deteriorated. Commonly known as old-age illness.

Moreover, he himself had said this—when young, he was obsessed with work, trading his life for money without taking care of himself. Now old, his body naturally failed him; a few minor ailments could easily take one's life. All the doctors and experts who had treated him were helpless.

Yue Xiaoshan was an extremely intelligent girl with strong psychological resilience. She had long accepted the fact that her father's health was deteriorating and he wouldn't live much longer. Yet she hadn't expected Su Nantian to suddenly give a completely opposite diagnosis, stating that Yue Han's illness could be cured and he might live another twenty or thirty years.

She instinctively thought Su Nantian was comforting her, telling her nice words to make her feel better. But this wasn't the answer she wanted.

"Xiaoshan, don't be so agitated," Su Nantian waved his hand, indicating she should calm down. "Yue Han's illness is difficult to treat, but I believe nothing is impossible."

His words were bold and confident. After all, only those with ability could speak with such authority. At present, he should be able to do so.

"Nantian, are you serious?"

Su Nantian's boldness seemed to have infected Yue Xiaoshan. She asked hesitantly, "But so many domestic and foreign experts said my father was incurable. Do you really have a way to cure him?"

"Of course," Su Nantian spoke earnestly, criticizing: "Some diseases are not determined by the name of an authoritative expert. Our Chinese medicine is profound and extensive; they don't understand many things, which isn't rare."

At this point, Su Nantian paused for two seconds and patted his chest confidently. "Xiaoshan, I'm telling the truth. I've already spoken with Yue Han. For the next few days, I'll completely cure him. The condition is that your family must fully cooperate with me. Can you do it?"

"Yes, of course!"

As soon as Su Nantian spoke, Yue Xiaoshan responded without hesitation. "Nantian, if you can cure my father, whatever conditions you propose, the Yang family won't refuse. Please rest assured."

"Then that's good."

Su Nantian nodded slightly and gestured with his hand, pointing to the adjacent lounge. "Xiaoshan, it's not convenient here; we can sit down and talk slowly. What do you think?"

"Fine, please."

Yue Xiaoshan nodded decisively and the two walked towards the lounge. Soon, they disappeared at the end of the corridor.

After discussing for over an hour, Su Nantian listed several pages of items needed for subsequent treatment. Fortunately, they weren't too rare. With the Yang family's wealth and resources, it would take only a few days to gather them. This would allow Yue Han some rest and buffer time, as frequent medication was too burdensome for his body. Moderation is the key.

Chapter 313: A Date

As Yue Han's condition gradually improved, Yue Xiaoshan's tense mind slowly relaxed. She returned to her normal routine, going back and forth between the company and home, occasionally attending meetings or banquets. Su Nantian was always by her side, extremely dedicated.

On Friday evening, after a busy day, Yue Xiaoshan left the office only when most of the staff had gone. She and Su Nantian walked towards the outdoor parking lot.

As Yue Xiaoshan stepped out of Xinyue Building, she instantly changed her demeanor. She lazily lay in the back seat of the business car, removing the black heels she had worn all day and rubbing her slightly red toes.

"Hey hey, beautiful lady. Be careful with your image! Remember you're a general manager!"

Su Nantian sat in the driver's seat, observing Yue Xiaoshan's comfortable posture through the rearview mirror and expressing his dissatisfaction as a grumpy driver.

Yue Xiaoshan ignored his complaints, adjusting to an even more comfortable position. The buttons on her business suit nearly burst open due to the movement of her full bust.

"Hmph. What's the problem? You spent the whole day lounging on the sofa, and now you don't even let me rest properly?" Yue Xiaoshan looked at Su Nantian and defiantly replied.

Su Nantian was exasperated. "What are you talking about? You're the boss, I'm just a helper. What's there to compare between us?"

"Cut it out! Then why are you still talking?"

Yue Xiaoshan suddenly realized her posture was inappropriate and quickly stopped her lips, adjusting her clothes to sit properly.

Ding!

At this moment, Yue Xiaoshan's phone suddenly rang. Seeing the name on the screen, she frowned.

Su Nantian noticed Yue Xiaoshan's abnormality and watched her unnatural expression through the rearview mirror, asking: "What's wrong? Why didn't you answer?"

"Nothing. Just a college classmate."

Yue Xiaoshan didn't seem to want to mention the topic. However, Su Nantian was quite interested in this female boss's college classmate, suspecting she must have been a prominent figure during her university years.

Under Su Nantian's inexplicable encouragement, Yue Xiaoshan glared at him and slowly pressed the answer button.

"Ah... I understand. If there's time, I'll go."

However, Su Nantian didn't hear the sensational news he had hoped for. Instead, Yue Xiaoshan's extremely cold response made him even more curious about her college life.

"Why? He's your classmate, why are you so cold?" Su Nantian wore a gossip face.

"He said it's a class reunion, and he insisted I attend." Yue Xiaoshan impatiently tossed her phone aside and slowly closed her eyes.

"What was your answer..."

Su Nantian remembered Yue Xiaoshan's indifferent tone. He guessed it was probably a fan of hers. Having such a beautiful boss as a classmate, every man would dream of it.

"Of course not. It's so boring. Every time they show off their achievements, who has a good job, who bought a house... and there are always these annoying flies."

Seeing Yue Xiaoshan's sneer, she probably meant the last sentence as the real point. Su Nantian was stunned; Yue Xiaoshan's classmates had such unique tastes, wanting to show off their wealth in front of a rich woman from Jiangcheng. It was truly masochistic behavior.

But as Su Nantian looked at Yue Xiaoshan's emotionless eyes, a possibility suddenly flashed in his mind: "Hey, Xiaoshan, maybe..."

"I don't think they know my identity. I'm not the kind of woman who brags," Yue Xiaoshan immediately shook her head, confirming it. She even straightened her full chest.

Su Nantian swallowed his saliva in silence; he couldn't deny Yue Xiaoshan's words. The facts were indeed like that.

Yue Xiaoshan was usually low-key; even most of the middle and lower-level employees at Xinyue Group probably didn't know her. Plus, the occasions she attended were top-tier company gatherings. These students who had just entered society wouldn't know Yue Xiaoshan's identity unless their families were aristocratic.

"So you should go," Su Nantian earnestly criticized Yue Xiaoshan.

"What's your plan?"

Yue Xiaoshan eyed Su Nantian suspiciously. Su Nantian chuckled: "Hehe, I don't have any ideas. Since there's a banquet, we might as well go!"

Su Nantian's carefree demeanor made Yue Xiaoshan slightly relax. She thought for a moment and nodded, taking this opportunity to use Su Nantian as a shield against those flies, preventing them from lingering on her boyfriend.

Fortunately, the new Xinyue Group's operations had already stabilized. So Yue Xiaoshan was usually idle at the company.

As Su Nantian put it, this was a chance to breathe in fresh air outside and promote comprehensive physical and mental health.

Yue Xiaoshan frowned: "You're just eager to have fun, right?"

To be honest, Su Nantian was used to moving around everywhere. If he were confined in a small office every day, he would go crazy. Now that there was a lively gathering, he naturally couldn't miss this good opportunity.

He had heard that college reunions were very exciting. This was something Su Nantian, who hadn't graduated yet, had always envied.

"Hey hey, old buddy, please. It's my class reunion. Why are you so excited?" Yue Xiaoshan covered her forehead, suddenly wanting to tease Su Nantian.

"I... I'm just happy for you!" Su Nantian smiled awkwardly.

"Then when I'm not around, you should take care of the office files!" Yue Xiaoshan smiled slightly.

Su Nantian immediately became angry and quickly showed his value: "Don't be like that, boss. Take me with you! I can sacrifice myself as your shield to block those flies' harassment. What do you think?"

This was already in Yue Xiaoshan's plan. She lifted her delicate chin, thought for a moment and extended two fingers: "Then you owe me two barbecues!"

"Deal!"

Su Nantian looked at Yue Xiaoshan laughing, helplessly shook his head. Indeed, one shouldn't partner with a woman who understands business; they always take the initiative.

Thus, the two made an agreement to attend the class reunion together on the weekend. On Sunday morning, Su Nantian was already waiting at the door in neat attire, patiently awaiting Yue Xiaoshan's descent.

However, when Yue Xiaoshan appeared, his face clearly showed disappointment.

"Hey, what's that expression?" Yue Xiaoshan saw Su Nantian change his face faster than flipping a book and scolded him with her hands on her hips.

Chapter 314: A Harmonious Act

"Xiaoshan, at least you could dress a little more formally," Su Nantian pointed to Yue Xiaoshan's simple dresses, even without a bit of makeup. She looked like an ordinary neighbor girl, making it impossible for anyone to recognize her as the cold-hearted female CEO.

"What's wrong? These are the most unobtrusive clothes in my wardrobe," Yue Xiaoshan helplessly shrugged. Su Nantian was speechless.

Indeed, Yue Xiaoshan's clothes were all high-end brands. Any single piece could dazzle her classmates' eyes, and one piece was worth their monthly salary.

"Alright, it's a class reunion, not a wedding!" Yue Xiaoshan looked Su Nantian up and down, saying.

Su Nantian noticed her thoughts and confidently said: "I only have these two outfits!"

"Alright, I didn't say you were too showy. Let's go, it's already after nine o'clock."

Yue Xiaoshan kept urging him. The two quickly left and drove to the location indicated by the text message. Su Nantian leaned out of the car window, examining the place they were going to eat.

After getting out of the car, he shook his head in disappointment and turned around to tell Yue Xiaoshan: "What's this? It's not as good as Kaiyue Hotel. Your classmate really shouldn't choose such a place."

Su Nantian had become accustomed to Jiangcheng's economic level. He could clearly see that "Longyue Hotel" was luxurious but, in a first-tier city like Jiangcheng, it could only be considered mid-up. It was still far from a four-star hotel like Kaiyue.

"Come on, you're picky even when there's food," Yue Xiaoshan said while wearing her sunglasses. Her dark lenses showed no emotion. For her, it didn't matter where they ate; the class reunion was just a formality.

According to Su Nantian's words, it was occasionally leaving the office and returning to normal life to avoid being out of touch with society.

But Yue Xiaoshan thought that even if she was immersed in work, with Su Nantian's presence every day, it would be hard for her to go off track. After all, Su Nantian considered himself always at the peak of trends.

Su Nantian's sincere words didn't seem to mean much to Yue Xiaoshan, but they reached the ears of a few receptionists at the door, causing them to raise their eyebrows.

"Hey, isn't that Xiaoshan? A classmate, today you have time to come to our class reunion?"

At this moment, a slightly arrogant voice came from behind Su Nantian and Yue Xiaoshan.

Su Nantian was puzzled and turned around. A man in a branded suit with gelled hair smiled and approached.

He felt the man's eyes quickly scanning him, clearly showing a sly and sneaky look. Though it was only for an instant, it immediately lowered Su Nantian's opinion of the man.

"Tan Ke, wasn't it you who called me?"

Yue Xiaoshan coldly answered. Obviously, she didn't find any humor in the man's self-congratulatory opening line.

"Ha ha, Xiaoshan is getting more beautiful,"

After being unexpectedly rebuked by Yue Xiaoshan, Tan Ke smiled and then looked at Su Nantian standing beside her. He pretended to just notice his presence, opening his mouth to speak.

"I'm Su Nantian, Yue Xiaoshan's boyfriend."

Before Tan Ke could speak, Su Nantian introduced himself first. As he spoke, his right hand naturally moved to Yue Xiaoshan's slender waist. Yue Xiaoshan blushed slightly but didn't resist.

This was why Yue Xiaoshan had brought Su Nantian, to prevent these flies from unnecessary flirtations.

Tan Ke's eyes widened. He looked at Su Nantian's right hand, wishing to switch hands with him.

"Brother, you're really joking. From what I know, Xiaoshan has never had a boyfriend..."

Tan Ke thought he was a person from the upper middle class and must always maintain his dignity, otherwise he would lose face in front of the goddess. However, Su Nantian was completely a country bumpkin attitude.

"Who are you calling brother? And don't call my girlfriend like that. Be careful I'll hit you!"

Su Nantian said and waved his fist at him. Yue Xiaoshan wished to cover her face, pretending not to know him, but she felt sweet inside. For a guy like Tan Ke who was smooth-talking, this direct method was the most effective.

Indeed, after hearing Su Nantian's crude threat, Tan Ke's face immediately turned dark. He looked at Su Nantian's solid body and thought about his own body drained by women, his expression changed repeatedly.

Damn it, why isn't this guy following the script? Now I've lost face in front of the goddess. How can I carry out my plan at the gathering?

While Tan Ke was thinking desperately about strategies, a more exaggerated voice came from behind him.

"Hey hey, Brother Ke! Why are you here?"

Then a man even more sly than Tan Ke ran over from the distance. Su Nantian saw Yue Xiaoshan's expression flash with disgust and became slightly interested in this unexpected guest.

From his attire, the man wasn't rich. His appearance was ordinary. However, when he spoke, Su Nantian immediately understood the reason for Yue Xiaoshan's disgust.

"Brother Ke is getting more handsome! I heard your company just went public. No wonder you're the class's top student, young and successful. I guess you've already become a multi-millionaire!"

The man's mouth was like a continuous cannon, constantly spouting flattery. Su Nantian raised his eyebrows; he was clearly a sycophantic lackey.

But this suited Tan Ke well. He gave the man a approving look. At his most embarrassed moment, this guy appeared and helped him regain momentum, making himself seem high-class. This way, maybe Yue Xiaoshan would look at him differently.

As Tan Ke was about to say "These are small achievements" to Yue Xiaoshan, he looked around and saw no sign of Yue Xiaoshan and Su Nantian. They had already walked hand in hand to the restaurant entrance during his admiration.

"Can we eat as much as we want today?" Su Nantian asked lazily.

"Yes... but don't eat too much, it's embarrassing," Yue Xiaoshan thought and answered.

They talked and laughed, leaving Tan Ke and the lackey behind. That was too annoying; they treated them as if they were invisible!

Chapter 315: Frequent Flirtations

"Brother Ke, isn't that your wife? Who is this man? Could it be..."

The lackey didn't know Tan Ke's thoughts and asked, frowning at Yue Xiaoshan and Su Nantian's back.

"Boyfriend? I think he's just a lowlife. Maybe Yue Xiaoshan hired him as a shield!"

"Unlikely, with his personality, she wouldn't do that. Maybe he really is her boyfriend and they're holding hands!"

The lackey spoke confidently, but Tan Ke's face darkened with each word he said.

"You shut up. You don't know anything, Yang Dong. Don't care who he is. The plan stays the same today. Since she came, she won't escape my hands!"

Tan Ke's face showed a sinister smile. Yang Dong laughed along, not asking why he was laughing; lackeys don't need reasons.

At that time, Su Nantian and Yue Xiaoshan didn't know that Tan Ke had no good intentions.

When they entered the private room pre-booked by Tan Ke, dozens of people's eyes immediately focused on them. This naked gaze was filled with envy, jealousy, and surprise...

Any person suddenly being stared at by so many eyes would be scared to tremble or quickly cover their face and go to their seat.

But they were Su Nantian and Yue Xiaoshan. Yue Xiaoshan had stood on stages where hundreds of people were more than her, with flashes from cameras that were much brighter than these eyes. She had long become accustomed to this.

Su Nantian wouldn't feel shy or afraid, of course. With his experience and perspective, he would fear these ants' gazes. He just felt uncomfortable being watched.

Then he yawned lazily and said, "Alright, alright. Don't give them the salute. They're all old classmates. Just sit down and don't be polite!"

Because Su Nantian was wearing this tailored black windbreaker, it must be said that this大哥 style of clothing suited him perfectly. It not only highlighted his long and solid physique but also had a痞痞霸道气质. A moment later, Yue Xiaoshan's classmates couldn't tell who was the main person and didn't dare to say much.

These rookies hadn't been in society for long. They knew the most important thing was not to offend Su Nantian, a so-called person from the underworld. Thus, he successfully suppressed Yue Xiaoshan's old classmates. Many people automatically considered him a thug who was chasing the goddess Yue Xiaoshan.

Until they sat down, the classmates noticed something strange. When Yue Xiaoshan's former female classmates invited her to sit on the girls' side, she just smiled politely at them and quietly moved past everyone, sitting beside Su Nantian in the corner.

Everyone was shocked. What's going on? Who said the goddess was being chased? This clearly had it backwards, right?

Actually, it wasn't that Yue Xiaoshan didn't give these female classmates face. It was because she was good at reading people's expressions and had already seen some disdain in their eyes. Obviously, these women who dressed up beautifully looked down on her with plain makeup.

No matter how they dressed up, Yue Xiaoshan still left them dozens of streets behind. The enthusiasm these people showed was probably to find a sense of superiority by using her plain clothes!

Yue Xiaoshan thought, it was easier to sit beside Su Nantian. At least she didn't have to compare with others on these trivial matters.

While Su Nantian and Yue Xiaoshan's arrival made everyone have their own thoughts, a loud door opening sound came from the entrance: "Clap your hands! Welcome our class reunion's main character, Brother Ke! Brother Ke, please pose for a photo. Wow wow! So handsome and so handsome!"

Yang Dong truly demonstrated the self-cultivation of a lackey. He raised his hands and cheered, while Tan Ke was radiant and walked in proudly.

He had every reason to be proud. He wasn't only the class's top student but also, after graduation, he was the one who had done well. He had arranged this class reunion himself.

But the audience remained silent, showing a very cold reaction. Tan Ke kept his self-proclaimed handsome posture and coughed awkwardly, walking to the table with a gloomy expression. He was curious why everyone's expressions were so strange, then saw Yue Xiaoshan and Su Nantian sitting in the far corner. He smiled slightly.

"Xiaoshan, can I sit here?"

Tan Ke wore a "touching" smile. It made Yue Xiaoshan feel repulsed. This smile was much worse than Su Nantian's clean and clear one!

Due to the presence of so many classmates, she could only reluctantly nod. Then she moved her chair slightly and got closer to Su Nantian.

Among the people present, they all knew that Tan Ke had been pursuing Yue Xiaoshan since student days. They chose to ignore this scene, but instead, many people were more interested in Su Nantian.

Among them were some infatuated girls who had been eyeing Su Nantian's handsome face since they entered. His sharp eyebrows and starry eyes made him a real beauty.

Although he was dressed simply, if Su Nantian heard this, he would probably want to kill someone.

But as the saying goes, a good-looking man is a clothes rack. This black windbreaker perfectly matched Su Nantian's cold and cool demeanor when he was silent. Even though they knew they weren't a match for Yue Xiaoshan, they kept throwing flirtatious glances at Su Nantian.

"Cough cough. How are you all doing recently?"

Tan Ke saw the atmosphere was a bit cold and started his first plan, but he was interrupted by a female classmate.

"Xiaoshan's little brother is so unfamiliar. Introduce yourself and let us know each other! You really impressed us when you came in!"

She said this while secretly winking at Su Nantian and lifting her chest, which was even more prominent than Yue Xiaoshan's.

"Old man said I didn't get any support, so I must have been overshadowed by this guy!"

Tan Ke suddenly realized and glared at Su Nantian with a fierce eye, but he spoke before Su Nantian could respond: "Actually, I recently invested in a company..."

"Exactly! What's your job?" Tan Ke was interrupted again, this time by another girl who had been pretty in class.

Chapter 316: Turned Over Like a Book

Su Nantian frowned. He hadn't noticed the furious Tan Ke beside him, but instead looked at Yue Xiaoshan with a half-smile.

Why was his charm so great? I just wanted to have a quiet meal. It's all because of my irresistible charm!

Yue Xiaoshan helplessly shrugged at him, watching Su Nantian being so popular. Her heart felt strange.

"Um..."

At this moment, Yang Dong received Tan Ke's signal and suddenly stood up from his seat, pointing at two women and shouting:

"Hey, Liu Tong, Wu Yueyue. You didn't hear Brother Ke speaking? I tell you, our Brother Ke is now a multi-millionaire!"

Yang Dong's words weren't very polite, but the content caused everyone's shock. Knowing Tan Ke was a rich second-generation, suddenly stating he had ten million in assets shocked these classmates who were still struggling to make a living.

"Ah, Brother Ke, don't be angry. I didn't expect you to become so successful!"

"Yes, Brother Ke, no, now we should call you Mr. Tan!"

The two women who had previously flirted with Su Nantian immediately changed their direction. After all, ten million was a number they could never imagine.

"Are your classmates so superficial? If they knew your identity, would they be shocked to the point of picking their jaws up?"

Su Nantian wiped his forehead, looking at Yue Xiaoshan's emotionless face and asked softly.

"I see why you didn't want to come," Yue Xiaoshan replied coldly.

"Ah, those are just small achievements. Yang Dong, you really shouldn't say such things. I'm still young and can't be too impetuous!"

Tan Ke looked as if he was blaming Yang Dong, but his expression clearly said: well done.

As for the male classmates beside him, they all lowered their heads and stayed silent. They secretly cursed: you can't be too impetuous, I think you've already floated to the sky!

After Tan Ke scolded Yang Dong, he suddenly changed his tone and continued with Liu Tong's topic. He looked at Su Nantian and asked softly: "What company do you work for?"

His face was full of mockery. From Su Nantian's attire, he thought the man's economic level definitely didn't exceed a white-collar worker. Even if he was handsome, it couldn't hide the fact that he was a country bumpkin.

"What? Me? I work at Xinyue Group with Xiaoshan. I said, can we hurry up with the food? I'm hungry!"

Su Nantian was criticizing the restaurant's slow service, but he was suddenly called out by Tan Ke. He thought for a moment and answered.

That's reasonable. His job now was to be Yue Xiaoshan's bodyguard, and they didn't know Yue Xiaoshan's identity.

"What? You also work at Xinyue Group?" After hearing Su Nantian's words, Tan Ke suddenly let out a gasp.

"Uh..."

Yue Xiaoshan, who was drinking water, heard the name "Xinyue Group" and almost choked.

"How do you know about Xinyue Group?"

Yue Xiaoshan looked at Tan Ke and asked coldly. She didn't believe her identity was so transparent that even a stray dog knew she was the boss of Xinyue Group.

Tan Ke realized he had let something slip and quickly explained: "When you love someone, of course you need to know everything about her. I not only know that Xiaoshan works at Xinyue Group, but also that your position isn't high. I was fortunate enough to attend a mid-level leadership meeting of Xinyue Group and didn't see your presence."

Su Nantian frowned, finding it painstaking to describe investigating others so poetically.

Tan Ke's tone was very proud. He seemed to be extremely proud of having attended a mid-level leadership meeting at Xinyue Group. His words were indeed well-received by these old classmates.

"Wow, Brother Ke, you even attended a meeting at Xinyue Group. I heard that most people can't get in!" Everyone envied.

"That's natural. Xiaoshan, although positions at Xinyue Group are hard to get, I swear that if you follow me, my company will have half of it! How about it?"

Tan Ke looked at Yue Xiaoshan with a loving gaze and suddenly proposed, while Su Nantian was amused. For such an unseeing person, he no longer felt like hitting him.

"I don't want it."

Yue Xiaoshan coldly replied. Mid-level leadership meetings? She was the top boss of Xinyue Group, would she attend such a meeting?

"Xiaoshan, you're still an entry-level employee at Xinyue Group. There are too many things you don't understand. I heard that the original boss of Xinyue Group is about to die, and the new one is a pervert who's never shown his face..."

Tan Ke stopped halfway, pointed to his head and said: "And I heard that he's sick. I'm really worried that such a beautiful woman like you might be deceived by him one day."

"Pu."

Su Nantian sprayed his drink on the ground. He vaguely saw a cold glint in Yue Xiaoshan's eyes and was worried about Tan Ke's intelligence.

If it weren't for Su Nantian holding Yue Xiaoshan back, she would have directly slapped a plate of pork shoulder on Tan Ke's face.

At this moment, Tan Ke still hadn't realized what he had said. He saw Yue Xiaoshan's excited expression and thought she was moved by his words. He felt a bit smug: it doesn't matter, take it slow; one day you'll be mine!
