"Indeed, this is crucial for their survival," Li Assistant nodded in satisfaction after receiving the response.

He slowly stepped forward, approaching Wu You'er with a domineering gaze. Since she was bound and gagged, she could neither move nor speak, only glaring at Li Assistant with furious eyes, her resentment and hatred evident in her gaze.

"Better not glare at me like that," Li Assistant spoke slowly, his voice cold and eyes equally icy. "You're no longer the precious one you once were. After Master Wu ascended as head of the family, you've become nothing but a废物 (waste)."

Each word Li Assistant spoke felt like a dagger piercing Wu You'er's heart, deeply wounding her. "So don't provoke me; otherwise, I'll dig out those pretty eyes of yours."

After all, Wu Chuan had said only that Wu You'er must remain alive. Whether she kept her eyes was irrelevant.

"Ugh..."

Wu You'er never expected Li Assistant to be so ruthless. It made sense, though; having served Wu Chuan for years, he had inevitably absorbed his methods. Now, hearing Li Assistant's threat, Wu You'er felt a chill in her heart and lowered her gaze, no longer daring to meet his eyes with the same fierce stare.

"Good. That's a good girl," Li Assistant remarked, nodding in satisfaction as he noticed Wu You'er's change of expression. He gave her a brief, cold glance before turning away.

"Keep a close watch on her," Li Assistant instructed the security personnel, then left without another word.

The guards followed his orders strictly, watching Wu You'er with unwavering vigilance. To ensure she wouldn't cause trouble again, they stood at the foot of her bed, eyes fixed on her without blinking.

Meanwhile, Li Assistant was also careful. After reprimanding Wu You'er, he immediately went to report to Wu Chuan, informing him of the incident. After all, regardless of reason, he had punished Wu You'er without permission, and must inform Wu Chuan to avoid suspicion.

After explaining the situation to Wu Chuan, Li Assistant assured him: "Master Wu, rest assured. These measures are only to keep Miss Wu quiet and will not harm her."

He added another promise: "I've also ordered the guards to check on Miss Wu regularly, ensuring she won't cause trouble again."

More importantly, they would not allow Wu You'er to take her own life like her parents had.

"Good job," Wu Chuan said after hearing Li Assistant's report, his expression not one of anger but approval. He added: "From now on, such matters needn't be reported to me; you have full authority."

He emphasized: "Just ensure she remains alive."

After all, Wu Chuan was now more curious about the person who had dared to rescue Wu You'er and had a growing interest in them.

As for Wu You'er, she was merely a bait to lure that person. As long as she remained alive and didn't interfere with his plans, it was sufficient.

"Yes, Master Wu! I understand!" Li Assistant replied, aware of Wu You'er's changed status.

He also knew Wu Chuan was preparing to announce himself as the next head of the family after the Wetland Bidding Conference. Thus, Wu You'er's value had diminished further, making her little more than a tool for release.

Therefore, Li Assistant no longer needed to treat Wu You'er with the same caution as before. He was free from fear of being reprimanded by Wu Chuan for any negligence.

Thinking this through, Li Assistant smirked, feeling his mood improve. He also felt it was time to repay Wu You'er for the suffering she had caused him.

He would make her regret every moment of her past arrogance.

Moreover, Li Assistant planned to teach Wu You'er a lesson, making her realize the current situation and never again overestimate herself.

"Go ahead," Wu Chuan said after instructing Li Assistant, then added: "By the way, increase the security personnel. But remember to keep them hidden; don't make it too obvious."

This order served two purposes: ensuring sufficient manpower to eliminate the target and preventing them from being frightened away. If that person saw an increase in security, they might hesitate to act, which would be problematic.

Wu Chuan had made up his mind to lure this big fish and play with it thoroughly.

"Yes, Master Wu. I'll take care of it immediately," Li Assistant replied without hesitation, understanding Wu Chuan's intent. He nodded in comprehension and said: "Master Wu, rest assured I'll handle this properly without any mistakes."

"Hmm," Wu Chuan nodded in satisfaction, his gaze more approving. His eyes held a storm of anticipation for what was to come.

Indeed, it had been a long time since Wu Chuan felt such anticipation. He was even eager to see the person.

"Leave," Wu Chuan said, dismissing Li Assistant with a wave of his hand.

"Yes, Master Wu." Li Assistant didn't dare delay. He nodded and quickly retreated.

Chapter 731: Returning to the Nangong Family

Meanwhile, Su Nantian had successfully escaped from Wu's estate. When he first fled, the security guards were still desperately trying to catch him. However, these guards were no match for Su Nantian's level; despite their efforts, they couldn't catch him or even see his face before he escaped.

No matter how angry and frustrated they were, they couldn't pursue him anymore.

Su Nantian worried that there might be more Wu family members nearby, so he immediately returned to the Nangong family to plan further.

But despite his escape, Su Nantian's mood was not relaxed; instead, it darkened further.

When he had gone to the Wu family that night to find Wu You'er, he had gambled everything. He was determined to take Wu You'er away safely.

Yet despite all the planning, unexpected events had occurred. Not only did he fail to rescue Wu You'er successfully but also discovered that Wu Tao and his wife had committed suicide.

This news was unbearable for Su Nantian to convey to Wu You'er. Remembering her pale, lifeless face and vacant eyes, he found it even harder to speak.

Moreover, Su Nantian feared his actions that night might have alerted Wu Chuan, leading him to retaliate against Wu You'er.

Considering Wu Chuan's treacherous nature and cruel methods, Su Nantian was even more worried about Wu You'er's ability to cope.

It didn't matter if Wu You'er exposed herself; after all, this identity was fake, and he wasn't concerned about the generous conditions Wu Chuan had offered.

Su Nantian was only worried that Wu Chuan would blame Wu You'er for his intrusion that night.

With Wu Tao and his wife dead, there was no one to balance Wu You'er's position.

Moreover, Su Nantian had overheard Li Assistant saying that Wu Chuan planned to announce himself as the new head of the family after the Wetland Bidding Conference. At that time, Wu You'er would be even less valuable to Wu Chuan.

Wu You'er's situation would only grow more dangerous.

After thinking this through, Su Nantian felt even more troubled, his worries impossible to suppress.

He couldn't delay any longer; there was no time left for deliberation. He had to go back to the Wu family again as soon as possible.

Although Su Nantian knew that after tonight's events, the Wu family's security would increase significantly, he couldn't leave Wu You'er unattended.

So Su Nantian had no choice but to take the risk and go in again, determined to rescue Wu You'er.

This mission had already taken too long, and unexpected situations had arisen that hadn't been planned for. Su Nantian couldn't afford to delay any longer, fearing more new developments that could complicate matters further.

"Hey, what are you doing here? Su Nantian?"

As Su Nantian was lost in thought, his shoulder was suddenly tapped lightly.

Startled by the event and the serious matters on his mind, he turned around quickly with a fierce gaze, like a leopard about to pounce.

Upon turning, he saw that the person standing behind him was none other than Nangong Yuyan, the family's mistress.

"Ah, it's the mistress."

Su Nantian quickly composed his expression and greeted her.

"What are you doing? That face scared me!" Nangong Yuyan exclaimed, placing a hand on her chest and lightly patting it to calm herself. She then scolded Su Nantian: "You scared me to death."

Before Su Nantian could respond, Nangong Yuyan immediately scrutinized him: "But it's so late. What are you doing here? Are you up to something again?"

Nangong Yuyan said this while eyeing Su Nantian with suspicion. "I remember warning you: no matter what you're planning, you mustn't endanger the Nangong family's interests. I won't allow you to betray us!"

Nangong Yuyan didn't give Su Nantian a chance to reply, instead glaring at him and issuing a threat. After all, she wouldn't allow anyone to harm the Nangong family's interests or disgrace them.

"Master, you're making it sound like I'm up to something bad," Su Nantian said with a smile, having calmed himself. He looked at Nangong Yuyan as if nothing had happened and said: "I was just standing here. You're imagining too much; I'm as innocent as Dou E!"

Su Nantian spoke casually, concealing his inner thoughts. His expression was serious, and his tone had no flaws.

Even as Nangong Yuyan scrutinized him with probing eyes, he showed no signs of guilt.

Nangong Yuyan, seeing this, couldn't tell if Su Nantian was telling the truth or lying. She only doubted him and said: "I hope you're not deceiving me, and I don't want to find out you're playing tricks on me!"

After saying this, she threatened: "Otherwise, I'll let you know the consequences of offending the Nangong family!"

"Thank you for your warning, Mistress," Su Nantian said without changing his expression. His eyes remained resolute and unyielding, showing no signs of guilt.

He smiled slightly and said seriously: "But regardless of how terrible the consequences are, I probably won't have the chance to try them."

Once Wu You'er was rescued, he would remove his mask. Even if the Nangong family had supernatural abilities, they wouldn't be able to catch him.

These so-called consequences and punishments would have no relation to him at all.

Moreover, Nangong Yuyan's appearance provided Su Nantian with a good hint. After tonight's events, Wu Chuan would definitely move Wu You'er. Since he couldn't go back to the Wu family at night, he had no choice but to find an opportunity.

And here was Nangong family's person, who had a cooperation with the Wu family. He could enter the Wu family openly.

Chapter 732: The Plan

"Thus, Mistress Nangong is overthinking," Su Nantian said with a light laugh, calming Nangong Yuyan's emotions.

"Hmph! Don't play tricks with me!" Nangong Yuyan said, narrowing her eyes and scrutinizing Su Nantian. After finding no issues or clues, she reluctantly收回 her gaze and warned him: "I hope you won't be against us."

Nangong Yuyan thought for a moment and added: "Mistress Nangong, rest assured."

Su Nantian replied indifferently. He was already mentally planning his visit to the Wu family tomorrow.

As he thought about this, Su Nantian felt like laughing. If Wu Chuan knew that he was entering the Wu family openly, would he die of anger?

There were only two days left until the Wetland Bidding Conference. That meant Su Nantian had to rescue Wu You'er as soon as possible, or she might suffer a lot.

Su Nantian was so engrossed in his thoughts that he carefully concealed his expression, revealing no clues. He could also focus on both tasks, giving Nangong Yuyan a harmless smile.

Seeing this expression, Nangong Yuyan still had some doubts but reduced her suspicions and concerns. She felt that if Su Nantian truly had problems, he wouldn't dare to be so bold in front of her. After thinking this through, Nangong Yuyan completely dispelled her doubts about Su Nantian.

But at this moment, she still couldn't help but warn Su Nantian: "Hey, Su Nantian. Just remember not to let me catch you in the act; otherwise, I won't hold back!"

Nangong Yuyan said this and it was truly her heartfelt words. After all, she always placed the Nangong family's interests first. And since Su Nantian had joined their family later, if he betrayed them, she wouldn't hold back and would give him no chance.

"Ha ha, Mistress, rest assured. Since I've promised you and made a promise in front of you, I won't do anything to betray the Nangong family."

Su Nantian said this calmly, and it wasn't a lie. After all, he was destroying the Wu family's interests, not the Nangong family's.

Moreover, in another way, his actions were indirectly helping the Nangong family. They didn't even thank him, so how could they continue to suspect him?

After thinking this through, Su Nantian slightly composed his expression and said to Nangong Yuyan: "Besides, Mistress's eyes are so sharp. If I were deceiving you, how could you not see it?"

Su Nantian directly put a high hat on Nangong Yuyan's head. He also seized the opportunity that the Nangong family was overly proud.

No sooner had he said this than Nangong Yuyan said with a smug expression: "Of course."

Nangong Yuyan's smile and pride were clearly visible.

"So you'd better be careful not to let me catch you deceiving me!" Nangong Yuyan warned Su Nantian again in a low voice, gazing at him deeply before turning to leave.

Su Nantian smiled slightly and watched Nangong Yuyan leave with a gentle gaze. As soon as she was out of sight, his expression changed immediately. He quickly composed all his expressions and began his second plan.

Because he knew there was no time to waste, he had already decided to find Nangong Ping and carefully think about tomorrow's events.

Su Nantian quickly arrived at Nangong Ping's room and knocked on the door.

"What is it?"

Nangong Ping hadn't gone to sleep yet. Upon hearing the noise outside, he immediately asked.

"It's me, Su Nantian."

Su Nantian quickly told Nangong Ping his identity and spoke respectfully.

"Oh, it's you, Nantian!"

Hearing Su Nantian's voice, Nangong Ping immediately came over and opened the door. He looked at Su Nantian with surprise: "Where have you been all day? I've searched for you several times but couldn't find you."

Upon hearing that Nangong Ping had looked for him, Su Nantian's heart skipped a beat but his expression showed no emotion. He smiled at Nangong Ping and explained: "Master, I went to check the dock's movements. After all, it's within your jurisdiction and must not have any problems."

While explaining, he also appeared to be thinking of Nangong Ping's interests. After that, he quickly apologized: "I didn't expect to delay your important matters; it's my fault."

"Hey, you're doing this for me. What's the problem with being wrong?"

Nangong Ping didn't suspect Su Nantian. Upon hearing this, he smiled and praised: "You're thinking thoroughly."

After saying this, Nangong Ping patted Su Nantian's shoulder: "I think with you around, I can reduce half of my worries!"

At this point, Nangong Ping remembered why Su Nantian had come to see him and asked: "But why did you come so late? Is there something wrong?"

After saying this, Nangong Ping thought about Su Nantian's mention of going to the dock and immediately asked: "Nantian, did something happen at the dock?"

After saying this, Nangong Ping looked at Su Nantian anxiously, fearing that there was something wrong at the dock.

"No, no, Master. You can rest assured; nothing happened at the dock."

Su Nantian quickly explained and then carefully revealed his purpose: "I was just thinking, since there are only two days left until the Wetland Bidding Conference, Master should take this opportunity to check on Wu Chuan's movements."

At this point, Su Nantian deliberately lowered his voice to create a more tense atmosphere.

"Master, you know Wu Chuan's character well. He agreed so nicely on the surface but didn't show any actions, yet this calmness seems too strange."

Chapter 733: The Plan to Visit the Wu Family

"Things that happen abnormally must have something strange. Wu Chuan's behavior is likely hiding some secrets."

At this point, Su Nantian took a step closer to Nangong Ping and lowered his voice: "It's really strange."

"How so?"

Nangong Ping immediately asked Su Nantian anxiously. Since Su Nantian had led him to do so many things that pleased his father and signed this contract, he had regarded Su Nantian as his strategist. Therefore, he trusted Su Nantian completely and was eager to ask him about this matter, fearing any mishaps. After all, it was crucial for him to succeed in becoming the new head of the Nangong family.

It's no wonder that Nangong Ping was so concerned.

"Master, don't you find it strange? According to Wu Chuan's character, he wouldn't cooperate so easily. He should have taken advantage of the situation or had some plans. But everything is too calm, and he showed no reaction at all."

Su Nantian slowly analyzed this to Nangong Ping, and his analysis was thorough. Combined with his serious expression, it made people believe him.

"Yes, you're right," Nangong Ping said. He had always thought Wu Chuan was not easy to deal with and had heard many of Wu Chuan's 'achievements' from his father. Now, hearing Su Nantian say this, it coincided with his own suspicions. Therefore, he immediately believed Su Nantian without any doubt.

After saying this, Nangong Ping quickly said: "I've always felt strange and uneasy. Now I know why."

Nangong Ping rested his chin, thinking carefully. The more he thought, the more he doubted Wu Chuan, even suspecting that every action and sentence of Wu Chuan was a hidden dagger.

"Could he be secretly preparing something big?"

At this point, Nangong Ping immediately thought of this terrifying possibility and his face changed. He quickly asked Su Nantian: "Nantian, your ideas are always the most, tell me what you think!"

Nangong Ping asked anxiously while looking at Su Nantian, as this was crucial for him to succeed in becoming the new head of the family. He didn't want any problems.

"Master, this is just my guess, so I don't have a specific plan to deal with Wu Chuan yet."

Su Nantian thought for a moment and replied to Nangong Ping.

After that, he said: "If..."

After saying the word 'if', Su Nantian immediately fell silent and didn't continue. His expression showed a hint of hesitation, as if he had something unspeakable.

The more he did this, the more Nangong Ping became anxious. His heart felt like a mouse running back and forth, making him uncomfortable.

"Ah, don't hesitate! Whatever you think of, just say it out loud!"

Nangong Ping saw Su Nantian's expression and knew he had something in mind but was hesitant to say it because of some matters. Therefore, Nangong Ping urged him again: "After all, only you and I are here. Even if we say something, it won't reach Wu Chuan's ears. What are you afraid of?"

"Master is right, after all, we're both on the same side."

Su Nantian was waiting for this sentence from Nangong Ping. After all, he had repeatedly emphasized that this was just his guess and an immature one at that.

But Nangong Ping insisted on him saying it. As a subordinate, he couldn't refuse his request.

Therefore, if something happened later, it wouldn't be on his head. That's why Su Nantian said this.

"So how about this, Master?"

Su Nantian now had a thoughtful expression and said slowly: "We'll visit Wu Chuan tomorrow to check if he shows any strange behavior."

At this point, Su Nantian revealed his plan. Actually, he just wanted to use Nangong Ping's help to enter the Wu family openly and then take the opportunity to check on Wu You'er's current situation.

"That's a good idea, excellent. Let's visit Wu Chuan tomorrow," Nangong Ping said after hearing Su Nantian's words. He immediately nodded, and his expression eased, no longer so serious or grim.

Then he suddenly remembered something and teased Su Nantian: "I say, checking the information is one part of it. The more important reason is that you really want to see Miss Wu, right? After all, such a beauty would naturally make you miss her."

Su Nantian heard Nangong Ping's misunderstanding. Although he didn't know where this idea came from, it inadvertently helped him. So this time, Su Nantian didn't deny it as before but showed an embarrassed expression, like the saying 'this place has no silver,' and said to Nangong Ping: "Master, don't tease me anymore. Even if I really like Miss Wu and she's in such a position, how would she consider me?"

Su Nantian deliberately belittled himself. After a pause, he said: "But if I could see Miss Wu once from afar, that would be enough for me."

At this point, Su Nantian showed an expectant expression, clearly hinting at Nangong Ping.

Indeed, when Nangong Ping heard this, he suddenly slapped the table and his chest, and loudly assured Su Nantian: "What's that? I'll make sure she comes out. Let you see her all at once, okay?"

After all, he was his good subordinate. Nangong Ping didn't want the person to have a difficult love life. At times, he would intervene and give Su Nantian some sweet rewards.

After all, it was just a few words to say. If said well, it could move Su Nantian and make him more loyal.

Su Nantian didn't expect to achieve his goal so easily. He thought again, and Nangong Lin's decision to hand over the family to Nangong Ping was indeed hasty. If he had given it to Nangong Yuyan, the family might have lasted another era. Unfortunately, he was limited by his old thinking and chose this mediocre son.

"Thank you, Master," Su Nantian said. But now he was being helped, so he wouldn't be so harsh as to speak ill of him behind his back. Therefore, he immediately thanked Nangong Ping sincerely.

After all, without Nangong Ping's help, he couldn't enter the Wu family openly. He needed to be grateful.

Nangong Ping waved his hand, as if it were no big deal: "That's good. You don't have to miss Miss Wu anymore. You can see the one you like tomorrow!"

After saying this, he suddenly teased Su Nantian and showed an ironic expression.

Since the other person had just helped him, Su Nantian didn't mind letting Nangong Ping have a few words of advantage. So after hearing Nangong Ping's teasing, he just smiled and didn't argue as before.

Moreover, he deliberately showed an embarrassed expression to match Nangong Ping's teasing, making the other person feel better.

Su Nantian spoke a few more casual words with Nangong Ping and then excused himself to let Nangong Ping rest, quickly leaving.

After exiting Nangong Ping's room, Su Nantian immediately collected his smile. His eyes became sharp and fierce, no longer appearing harmless.

I hope everything goes smoothly tomorrow.

I also hope to see Wu You'er's situation. If there's an opportunity, Su Nantian wanted to take the chance to rescue Wu You'er and avoid any further problems.

After thinking about these thoughts, Su Nantian quickly clenched his fist and carefully considered what he needed to do tomorrow.

It wasn't long before the next morning. Su Nantian was lost in thought.

Nangong Ping also wanted to quickly find out what Wu Chuan, the old fox, was up to in secret. So they agreed immediately and got up early, then hurriedly went to visit the Wu family.

Everyone was thinking about this matter, so they arrived at the Wu family quickly.

As soon as they arrived, Li Assistant came out to greet them.

And when Li Assistant saw Nangong Ping, he seemed very surprised, his eyes showing a hint of confusion.

When Li Assistant saw Su Nantian, he immediately gave him a look, as if asking why Nangong Ping had suddenly come to visit the Wu family without prior notice.

Su Nantian hadn't forgotten that Wu Chuan and Li Assistant had previously lured him into their camp, and he had pretended to agree. So at this moment, he nodded slightly in response.

But since Nangong Ping was here, he couldn't say anything.

Li Assistant also understood this and didn't dare to ask too directly, so he suppressed his curiosity and quickly led them into the reception room.

After serving tea and snacks, Li Assistant smiled and said to Nangong Ping: "What good day is this? Why has Master Nangong come over?"

After saying this, Li Assistant continued with a smile: "But why didn't Master Nangong call ahead? Fortunately, the master is still at home; otherwise, you would have wasted your trip."

In fact, Li Assistant was very clear that Nangong Ping had come early to block Wu Chuan. It wasn't easy to say that Wu Chuan was out so early.

So Li Assistant, while serving tea to Nangong Ping, also probed him subtly to find out why Nangong Ping had suddenly come over.

Nangong Ping said nothing and didn't explain to Li Assistant, only smiling: "Please inform the master for me. I need to talk to Wu Chuan about something important."

Nangong Ping was directly asking Li Assistant to call Wu Chuan, and he didn't say anything else.

"Of course, Master Nangong. Please wait a moment while I go and fetch the master," Li Assistant said, but he hadn't found out anything. He didn't want to ask too directly and had to suppress his curiosity, fearing he would make Nangong Ping wary.

Li Assistant nodded to Nangong Ping and said a sentence before turning around to go in and fetch Wu Chuan.

But before leaving, Li Assistant gave Su Nantian a meaningful look. That gaze contained many probes, as if asking what had happened.

But Su Nantian didn't have the time to deal with Li Assistant at this moment, so he deliberately showed a troubled expression and pointed at Nangong Ping sitting beside him.

This action told Li Assistant that he wasn't unwilling to go out, but couldn't.

Li Assistant understood that Su Nantian was constrained by Nangong Ping and, at this moment, couldn't find an excuse to leave. So he had no choice but to give up and went in to invite Wu Chuan.

"Su Nantian, do you think Wu Chuan is hiding something from us?"

After Li Assistant left, Nangong Ping immediately asked Su Nantian with confusion.

Su Nantian shook his head: "Master, we have no evidence. It's just a guess; it might not be accurate. But since we're already here at the Wu family, let's see what Wu Chuan's intentions are."

"You're right," Nangong Ping said, nodding in agreement.

Nangong Ping had no other ideas and agreed. He was about to say something but hadn't finished when Wu Chuan entered with Li Assistant and several bodyguards.

Seeing the old fox arrive, Nangong Ping had to suppress his doubts for now.

Wu Chuan quickly strode in, his gaze calm and a gentle smile on his lips. He seemed very amiable.

As he entered, he subtly observed Nangong Ping, as if also wondering why Nangong Ping had suddenly come to visit the Wu family.

Wu Chuan carefully observed Nangong Ping, always thinking deeply.
