Su Nantian waved his hand dismissively, dismissing the matter as trivial while mentally assessing Yue Han and his daughter, as well as the entire Xin Yue Technology Group's significance to the Dragon Group.

Otherwise, how could Old Du, known for his stinginess, engage in such a loss-making deal? He had specifically requested Yeyang Vine and then generously gifted several other valuable medicinal herbs. This was clearly unreasonable.

Once Yue Han awoke, Old Du would surely tally the costs with him. The Yue family would inevitably suffer heavy losses; Old Du was no one to be easily deceived.

However, the subsequent chaos had nothing to do with Su Nantian. He focused solely on his duties.

The current state of Xin Yue Group was unstable. Even if Yue Han awoke smoothly, he would likely remain in Jiangcheng for some time to ensure no further complications arose for Yue Han and his daughter. After all, the hidden threats remained unresolved, and the scheming members of the Yue family still eyed them hungrily.

As it neared five in the afternoon, Su Nantian anticipated Yue Xiaoshan's promise of an all-you-can-eat feast. He promptly urged, "Xiaoshan, you didn't forget your promise, did you?"

"Of course not!"

Yue Xiaoshan's mood was excellent. She waved her hand generously, declaring, "Come on, I'll take you to eat now."

Chapter 307: A Series of Unforeseen Events

Yue Xiaoshan led Su Nantian out of the Yue family villa. They did not take a car but walked along the main road in front of the mansion, chatting as they went. They eventually stopped at a street food alley.

It was dinner time, and the street was bustling with activity. Stalls offering every kind of delicacy made it clear why Yue Xiaoshan had confidently promised to feed Su Nantian well.

Yue Xiaoshan clearly knew this place intimately. She pointed to a dumpling stall nearby and smiled, saying, "We'll eat dumplings here first. Then you buy me a cotton candy."

"Sure," Su Nantian glanced around, noting that the cotton candy stall was not far from the dumpling stand. He could intervene quickly if anything happened, so he complied with Yue Xiaoshan's request and hurried to queue for cotton candy.

Seeing Su Nantian so obedient, Yue Xiaoshan happily found a seat at the dumpling stall and waited for the food to arrive.

At that moment, several rough-looking hooligans approached. They carried batons at their waists and smoked cigarettes, cursing as they wandered aimlessly—clearly no good people.

Soon, their eyes fell on Yue Xiaoshan. They immediately rallied around the dumpling stall, as if electrified.

The leader was a long-faced hooligan who approached Yue Xiaoshan and said excitedly, "Miss, you're sitting alone eating dumplings. Isn't that lonely? We have many brothers; let's eat together."

"Go away," Yue Xiaoshan coldly glanced at the long-faced hooligan and bluntly spat out a single word, nearly driving him mad.

"Little girl, don't be so disrespectful... wait until Tiger Brother arrives and see what you'll do!"

Before he could finish speaking, the long-faced hooligan turned to call for help, intending to teach this insolent girl a lesson.

But as he turned, his gang and the notorious Tiger Brother stood there in stunned silence, gawking at Yue Xiaoshan.

The long-faced hooligan shook his head in disbelief, "Hey, don't play like that. Have you never seen a beautiful woman before?"

Upon reflection, they usually caused trouble in the streets but had never encountered such a stunning beauty.

"Ah, I like this beauty. Her coldness only fuels my desire to conquer her."

Seeing the long-faced hooligan turn to look at him, Tiger Brother quickly wiped his mouth and rubbed his palms, clearly unaware that his underling had already failed.

From the back, Yue Xiaoshan's seductive figure had nearly ignited a fire in his heart. Now seeing her fierce yet coy expression, that fire would surely be doused with a bucket of gasoline.

"Little beauty, you're so cold and aloof. Don't worry; I'll make sure you can't resist me at the hotel!"

Banlanhu flashed a repulsive, lecherous smile that made Yue Xiaoshan despise him. This was genuine lechery, entirely different from Su Nantian's playful teasing.

"Get lost!"

Yue Xiaoshan remained unshaken, her gaze devoid of emotion. Her words barely affected her, and she had no desire to engage further with these people. She turned away without another word.

Yet Banlanhu's gang, seeing Yue Xiaoshan turn again and leave them with an alluring silhouette, thought she had implicitly agreed. They let out "heh-heh" pig-like grunts and approached Yue Xiaoshan.

"Hey, buddy, your girlfriend seems to be in trouble!"

Hearing the commotion at the dumpling stall, the cotton candy vendor looked up and offered a warning.

"What?"

Su Nantian, watching the vendor's skill in wrapping cotton candy, suddenly realized and glanced at Yue Xiaoshan surrounded by hooligans. He sighed wryly, thinking that beauty was indeed trouble wherever it went!

"No more talk; I need to uphold justice."

Su Nantian stretched his arms and took the blue cotton candy from the vendor.

"Again, it's Banlanhu's gang... Ah, kid, I tell you not to fight them directly. Last time a man was crippled and cried in the hospital for days."

The cotton candy vendor seemed to recall something, worrying as he extinguished the fire.

He was speaking to Su Nantian, but after a while, there was no response. The vendor frowned and scratched his head—Su Nantian had vanished in seconds, and he hadn't even paid!

But soon, the vendor noticed that a bunch of bamboo sticks used for wrapping cotton candy had mysteriously disappeared from his small basket.

No way to play like that! Eating without paying was bad enough, but stealing his things too!

The cotton candy vendor muttered in anger at Su Nantian.

At the dumpling stall, Banlanhu waved his hand and cleared a path for his gang to surround Yue Xiaoshan. He smiled mischievously, preparing to touch Yue Xiaoshan's face without makeup but exceptionally exquisite.

Just as his fat hand was halfway, there was a "swoosh" sound. His sleeve was pierced by a bamboo stick, and the immense force even staggered him unintentionally.

"Who? Who dared to ambush me?"

Swoosh!

Rip—

Another sharp sound of a blade slicing through the air. This time, Banlanhu's pierced sleeve was torn off a piece of fabric. The bamboo stick passed through the crowd and finally nailed itself into a wooden signboard.

"Ah, you've finally arrived."

Yue Xiaoshan, who had been slightly annoyed, widened her eyes. Such a magical technique could only be performed by Su Nantian, that oddball.

"Little beauty, what's your business with me?"

Sure enough, Su Nantian's lazy voice echoed behind Yue Xiaoshan. She turned quickly and saw it was indeed Su Nantian arriving.

"You idiot, your speed is too slow. Didn't you see I was being bullied?"

Yue Xiaoshan suddenly felt a pang of委屈. This guy clearly did it on purpose, deliberately waiting until now to help. He must have wanted to see her embarrassed!

If Su Nantian knew his well-meaning help was met with this thought, he would have raised his hands and cried innocence. The street food alley was already noisy with haggling; he had only noticed her situation after the cotton candy vendor's warning.

But thinking of this, Su Nantian felt a chill in his heart. Next time he came here, he must never leave Yue Xiaoshan's side.

Chapter 308: Violent Intimidation

"You weren't going to eat cotton candy?"

Su Nantian's face showed more委屈. He suddenly pulled out a bunch of exquisite blue cotton candy from behind and offered it to Yue Xiaoshan.

This action left Yue Xiaoshan both laughing and crying, her icy demeanor instantly thawing. A faint blush appeared on her face—due to excitement at Su Nantian's timely arrival and the shyness of being unexpectedly flirted with.

"Hey, are you two flirting? Kid, dare to mess up my plans, I think you're living too long!"

As the saying goes, a smile can make one beautiful. Yue Xiaoshan's sudden dazzling smile left Banlanhu and his gang, who were used to crude women, stunned. Tiger Brother wiped his mouth in awe.

"Beauty is indeed beauty. You're truly charming, my apologies."

Su Nantian looked at Tiger Brother's dazed expression with a pitying gaze and shrugged his shoulders to Yue Xiaoshan.

Yue Xiaoshan sighed, "I'm just as helpless."

"Hey, Xiaoshan, step back a bit. I'm afraid my energy might accidentally injure you!"

Su Nantian exaggeratedly wrapped his arms around Yue Xiaoshan's body and took a step back, silently pushing her out of the hooligans' circle. His palm still felt the softness of her skin, causing Yue Xiaoshan to blush again.

Banlanhu realized his unintentional action had given Su Nantian a chance to rescue the beauty. He was furious—without this kid, his hand would have been on that beauty now.

He signaled to his gang with a glance. They nodded understandingly and drew their self-made batons and baseball bats, glaring at Su Nantian with fierce expressions.

"Ha!"

Su Nantian let out a cold laugh, clearly dismissing these low-level thugs.

He slowly stretched his hands behind him and raised them again, with dozens of thin, sharp bamboo sticks between his fingers.

"Ha! Kid, are you mocking me? What do you think you're doing—playing Wolverine? Do you really have wolf claws?"

Banlanhu laughed heartily at Su Nantian's exaggerated stance. His gang joined in, completely unaware of the impending disaster.

"Ah? Is that so?"

Su Nantian's face showed an enigmatic expression, which Banlanhu couldn't decipher.

Suddenly, his fingers spread and closed, and nearly fifty bamboo sticks seemed to come alive in his hands, forming a blooming lotus.

Banlanhu's laughter stopped abruptly. He suddenly remembered the item that had torn his sleeve—those tiny bamboo sticks.

He instinctively swallowed, trying to hide his panic and shouted at his gang: "Brothers, don't fear this white-faced kid. Today we'll cripple him and set an example for these disobedient vendors!"

After saying that, he encouraged himself while pulling out a large spring knife from his pocket. He was ready to fight seriously, as anyone familiar with gang fights could tell.

However, the long-faced hooligans still thought Su Nantian was an easy target and that Yue Xiaoshan was a piece of meat to be devoured. They tried to appear fierce.

Because Banlanhu had said they needed to re-establish authority over the vendors to better collect protection money.

"Go! Let's cripple him first!"

With Banlanhu's command, the hooligans roared and swung their bats and batons recklessly toward Su Nantian.

Seeing this, Su Nantian shook his head in boredom. These thugs were too slow; their movements had obvious flaws. Anyone with basic martial arts knowledge could easily take them down.

BANG!

Su Nantian dodged the first hooligan who tried to show off, and the latter's full-force swing missed. The momentum almost knocked him over. Su Nantian's virtue of helping others was demonstrated here.

He dodged the other hooligans' attacks and gave one a kick. The unfortunate long-faced hooligan let out a "woof" sound and fell face-first, crashing into the ground.

Seeing this, the hooligans stopped laughing and prepared to swing their bats again, but there was no sign of Su Nantian. He had already retreated three steps away during their momentary distraction.

"Kid, you've got guts! Don't run—coward, what else can you do besides running!"

Banlanhu, seeing his underlings defeated, was angry and began to taunt Su Nantian, trying to provoke him.

Su Nantian gave him a big smile: "Don't rush; the real fun is just beginning. Since you all want to be beaten, I'll comply with your request."

"What do you mean?"

Banlanhu was about to charge forward when Su Nantian's words confused him. He felt a sudden chill in his lower body and looked down to find his pink Garfield underwear exposed.

Yue Xiaoshan turned away in disgust, mentally cursing Su Nantian thousands of times. This absurd guy could do such a disgusting thing.

"Ah, your underwear's gone!"

At the same time, the hooligans' eyes were fixed on their fierce leader's lower body. Their expressions were subtle, and they kept making strange noises.

Su Nantian was also bewildered; he had no malicious intent. His original plan was to humiliate them, and it was unintentional that he had exposed this. He hadn't meant to harm their dignity!

"Ah, pink Garfield! I didn't know you had a fierce tiger inside and could smell roses!" Su Nantian grinned mischievously.

"Kid, you're asking for death!"

Banlanhu had never felt so humiliated. Not only was his biggest secret exposed, but the opponent had trampled on his pride and even spat in his face.

Furious, he lost all reason and recklessly pushed aside the laughing gang members, staring at the culprit who had ruined his dignity.

"What? You're still not satisfied?"

Su Nantian spun the remaining bamboo sticks in his fingers, their pale green tips emitting an intimidating chill.

A flash of green light rapidly passed, brushing Banlanhu's hair and piercing the wooden board behind him.

Seeing that fleeting cold light, Banlanhu instantly calmed down. He clearly remembered these ordinary bamboo sticks could be manipulated by Su Nantian with such skill, even tearing his clothes.

Chapter 309: Heart Racing

That meant if the opponent wanted, they could easily pierce through his throat.

The thought was terrifying!

Banlanhu instinctively took a few steps back, wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, and stared at Su Nantian's dancing bamboo sticks. He remained still, fearing the next moment a bamboo stick would fly and take his life.

But upon reflection, he had dominated this street food alley for years; today he couldn't be defeated by an unknown nobody. If direct confrontation failed, he could resort to underhanded tactics.

Banlanhu's small eyes gleamed with cunning, his gaze split between watching Su Nantian's expression and secretly gripping his spring knife.

"Ah, such a coward."

Su Nantian saw Banlanhu's fear and sighed regretfully. He was about to turn around and comfort the startled Yue Xiaoshan.

"Kid, die!"

Banlanhu seized the opportunity and suddenly lunged forward, his knife flying straight at Su Nantian's head.

"Su Nantian, be careful!"

Yue Xiaoshan watched closely; her smile had already faded. She could almost see Su Nantian falling in front of her, and tears began to well up.

But Su Nantian was faster than them. Banlanhu's clumsy performance couldn't trick him?

Just as Yue Xiaoshan's words hadn't finished, Su Nantian suddenly turned and shot dozens of bamboo sticks in a beautiful arrow pattern from his fingers.

Dozens of bamboo sticks flew like arrows through the air, their thin tips gradually enlarging in Banlanhu's eyes.

"Ah!"

In an instant, Banlanhu's fierce demeanor vanished. He couldn't even block or defend, his pupils widening in shock and letting out a scream.

"Who's crying? It's like I castrated you!" Su Nantian impatiently rubbed his ears, which had been itching from the shock.

"Hey?"

Hearing Su Nantian's voice, Banlanhu quickly opened his eyes and stared wide-eyed to see if there were any holes in his body.

"Brother, wake up! You're still alive!"

Su Nantian exaggeratedly approached and patted Banlanhu's shoulder.

"Don't touch me!"

Banlanhu reflexively took a few steps back, but this movement pulled down the clothes Su Nantian had pressed against him.

Rip—

Banlanhu's high-end leather coat instantly tore into countless small strips, hanging on his plump waist and fluttering in the wind. His lower body remained in the pink Garfield underwear.

"Ha! Ha!"

The long-faced hooligan couldn't hold back and laughed first, then quickly covered his mouth. It was too late.

With his lead, the other hooligans couldn't resist laughing at Banlanhu's terrified expression. They had endured so long under his rule, gaining little but suffering much. If it weren't for fearing his brother's support, they would have scattered long ago.

"You!"

Banlanhu glared at the long-faced hooligan, picked up the fallen spring knife, and quickly retreated a few steps. He pointed at Su Nantian and roared: "Kid, today I've lost to you. Remember this, Banlanhu will definitely make you pay!"

"Such a lot of words!"

Swoosh!

Su Nantian shot the last bamboo stick used for cleaning teeth, precisely piercing Banlanhu's remaining coat collar. The leather jacket then disintegrated into two halves, helplessly falling to the ground.

"You can retaliate as you wish, but remember not to play dirty. If you want to leave alive, don't do that."

Su Nantian casually picked up a chopstick from the ground and suddenly narrowed his eyes. The chopstick flew out of his hand, brushing past Banlanhu's ear and whizzing through.

Ding!

The bamboo chopstick pierced the wooden board behind him, deeply embedded and leaving half its length sticking out.

Banlanhu finally realized he was now a prisoner. Thinking of Su Nantian's strange techniques, if the opponent didn't want him to leave this place, it was truly no problem.

He glanced around and quickly changed his expression to one of submission, whispering: "No, no. I promise that today, as long as you let me go, I'll never appear in your eyes again!"

Su Nantian understood Banlanhu's kind of people; his promise was like a fart, but he didn't need to argue with such small pests. Otherwise, if it were his old self, he would have eradicated these nuisance fish in their cradle.

No choice but to respect the law here. Since Banlanhu had said that, he naturally had no reason to trouble him.

Su Nantian looked at Yue Xiaoshan with a questioning gaze. Yue Xiaoshan realized Su Nantian was asking for her opinion, so she frowned and waved her hand in disgust.

She was still angry at these hooligans for disturbing her meal, but even so, they didn't deserve death. There was no need to exterminate them completely.

"Alright, go!"

Su Nantian also didn't want to continue arguing with these people. He waved his hand impatiently, signaling them to leave quickly.

Banlanhu and the others finally felt relieved. The hooligans quickly picked up their scattered batons and baseball bats, while Banlanhu grabbed the long-faced hooligan's clothes and spread them in front of him. This guy still had some shame.

As they prepared to flee, Su Nantian's calm voice suddenly echoed behind them: "Wait, don't rush to leave yet!"

Banlanhu nervously turned around, fearing Su Nantian would fly a bamboo stick to teach him a lesson: "Brother, is there anything else?"

Su Nantian didn't speak immediately but scanned the surroundings. Because of their fight, this dumpling stall had almost been destroyed by these hooligans.

Although they hadn't touched Su Nantian at all, the collateral damage was indeed strong, breaking the tables and chairs and leaving the clean table full of footprints.

"Look, because of you, I had to break the old man's eating utensils. You should at least compensate him!"

Banlanhu saw Su Nantian's smiling face and immediately understood the meaning behind his words. This was definitely a extortion.

"Understood, I'll compensate."

He was a veteran, so he immediately took out a wallet and handed it over. At this moment, his excessive focus on money only made him more dangerous.

Chapter 310: Cure the Illness

"Good for you."

Su Nantian frowned slightly. This wallet contained a thick stack of cash, about three to five thousand yuan.

He estimated the approximate price in his mind and knew this was more than enough for compensation. He took out the money from Banlanhu's wallet and handed it to the dumpling stall owner.

"These are for compensation, do you have any objections?"

After saying that, he tossed the wallet back to Banlanhu, who nodded repeatedly: "No objections, I fully agree!"

"Um... this young man, I have a little objection. Let's just call it even. I don't need compensation; these broken tables don't cost that much!"

As Banlanhu finished speaking, the old man who sold dumplings rushed out and loudly refused.

What was he thinking? This entire street food alley was under Banlanhu's protection. Even if he destroyed the whole stall, he could only endure it. Who dared to take this guy's money!

"You old fool, are you looking for death!"

Banlanhu saw Su Nantian's expression change and felt a bad omen. He was furious at the dumpling stall owner, clenching his teeth.

He had planned to leave once the stall owner agreed, but this old man had interfered uninvited. It was really seeking trouble.

"Hmm? What did you say?" Hearing Banlanhu's mumble, Su Nantian narrowed his eyes.

"Uh... I mean I voluntarily compensate. I definitely need to pay the old man's loss!"

After saying that, Banlanhu snatched the stack of red bills from Su Nantian's hands and forcibly shoved them into the dumpling stall owner's hands. Then, without waiting for anyone to react, he ran away like a rabbit.

"This..."

Su Nantian watched Banlanhu, wearing the Garfield underwear, sprinting to the end of the street. A meaningful smile appeared on his lips. From now on, this street food alley would surely have another amusing story to tell!

"Good job!"

"Little brother, you did great. Old Zhang is impressed!"

"I'm also impressed. Today, the two of you can eat whatever you want for free; we'll treat you!"

The various stall owners on the street had long been bullied by Banlanhu and his gang. They hadn't dared to confront them directly.

Now, Banlanhu had suffered a big loss at Su Nantian's hands, losing face and even having his clothes stripped off. It was truly embarrassing.

This guy would likely not dare to return to the street food alley for a long time, so they could finally run their businesses peacefully. Thus, they all clapped and cheered for Su Nantian.

Su Nantian remained calm, bowed to the crowd behind him, and smiled: "Hehe, thank you all. You're being kind!"

"Being kind? You think you're fat and are breathing heavily."

Yue Xiaoshan pinched Su Nantian's arm. Women were women; she said this way, but her eyes honestly scanned Su Nantian to check if he was injured. This made Su Nantian feel embarrassed.

"Alright, after a little exercise, my stomach is empty now. Since everyone was so kind, I won't be polite."

Su Nantian quickly turned his head and looked at the barbecue stall, preparing to eat heartily and fill his stomach.

Yue Xiaoshan was angry and stomped her foot but couldn't do anything about it. Finally, her appetite took over, drawn by the tempting aroma of grilled skewers. They both ate heartily without caring about their appearance.

After this small incident, Su Nantian and Yue Xiaoshan happily solved the dinner problem and returned to rest.

The next morning, a person sent by Old Du arrived at the Yue family villa on time.

This man was also one of the Dragon Group's martial arts masters, with strength comparable to Zhang An. They were both at the peak of cultivation. It showed how seriously Old Du took this matter, even sending medicine with such caution.

Five minutes later, the man handed over the three herbs to Su Nantian and left without hesitation. He probably had other things to do.

Now that the required herbs were in place, Su Nantian didn't hesitate. He selected several common auxiliary herbs from the Yue family villa's store and brewed a decoction with the newly acquired Yeyang Vine, administering it to Yue Han in the high-temperature room.

Within an hour, Yue Han awoke with a groan. The entire Yue family was overjoyed. Yue Xiaoshan almost hugged Su Nantian and cried.

There was no choice but to comfort everyone and perform a detailed full-body examination on Yue Han, confirming that the cold poison was gradually fading.

However, to completely detoxify, he needed to stay in the high-temperature room for a few more days. After all, his body was cold and uncomfortable, making this high-temperature room suitable for him.

Time quickly passed another day. On the second evening, Yue Han was fully awake and could even sit on the bed reading newspapers.

Seeing this situation, his recovery was more optimistic than Su Nantian had anticipated. This was largely thanks to the two herbs Old Du had generously gifted; otherwise, he wouldn't have removed the cold poison so quickly.

Su Nantian checked Yue Han's pulse and nodded: "Mr. Yue, most of the cold poison in your body has been cleared. The remaining traces are not worth worrying about. Stay a few more days in the high-temperature room, and you'll be able to move back to a normal room."

"Ah, that's great!"

Hearing this, Yue Han's old face lit up. He began to vent: "Ah, little Su, you don't know how hot it was here. Now that I'm fully awake, my whole body feels uncomfortable, as if burning inside and constantly sweating."

"Mr. Yue, this is a normal reaction."

Su Nantian was worried that Yue Han would sneak out to cool off and hurriedly explained: "After all, your cold poison is gradually fading. The temperature in this room exceeds what ordinary people can endure. You naturally feel uncomfortable."

"But because of that, it's better for targeted treatment and suppressing your cold energy. Don't be hot and run away; if the cold poison returns, it'll be you who suffers."

Su Nantian spoke half-seriously, and Yue Han's face changed. He nodded in understanding: "Yes, I understand your meaning. Please rest assured; I'll follow your medical advice and won't act on my own, running around everywhere."

"Good then."

Su Nantian sighed in relief: "Mr. Yue, if there's nothing else, I'll leave now. Please rest well."

"Ah, wait a moment."

Yue Han suddenly sat up straight and asked mysteriously: "Little Su, I saw your medical skills are so high. Do you think you can cure this kind of problem?"

Su Nantian was stunned and asked in confusion: "Hmm? Which one?"

"About men's issues, of course." Yue Han lowered his voice, fearing the guards and servants outside would hear.

Chapter 311: Old Ailment

Su Nantian immediately understood and sighed helplessly: "Ah, okay, I get it."

"Hey, why are you looking like that?"

Seeing Su Nantian's expressionless face, Yue Han felt no embarrassment and explained: "Ah, you must know that people of our status have spent most of their lives exchanging life for money, leaving them with various ailments."

He stopped halfway and shook his head: "As we grow older, it's naturally hard to bear. Some people start thinking about exchanging money for life. I have many old friends with various problems, especially regarding male virility. You should understand."

"I do, I do."

As Yue Han finished speaking, Su Nantian nodded repeatedly in understanding: "Mr. Yue, I understand your meaning. In fact, many of my elders have asked me about this issue before; the situations are largely similar."

Su Nantian was no longer the same as before. His medical skills and vision had greatly improved, so minor issues in male health were no problem.

As long as he diagnosed and gave a few acupuncture points, took some medicine, it wasn't that difficult to restore seven or eight out of ten.

Moreover, with Yue Han's status, those he called old friends and brothers were at least as high in position.

If Su Nantian could use Yue Han's connection to build a bridge with several influential figures domestically and internationally, it would greatly benefit his future development. He wasn't a fool; he knew what to do at this moment.

"Ah, is that so?"

Hearing Su Nantian's seemingly casual mention of this, Yue Han's eyes lit up and eagerly asked: "So you've treated people like that before?"

"That's a must."

Su Nantian nodded without hesitation and patted his chest: "Mr. Yue, I'm not boasting. This kind of minor issue isn't a problem at all. I can cure one or two people every month. If you're willing, you can introduce a couple of them to me for testing."

"Good!"

Su Nantian's genuine confidence pleased Yue Han. He smiled and nodded: "Little Su, I'll bring Old Cheng to you for a checkup later. He's complained to me many times about this issue, hoping you could solve it."

"No problem."

Su Nantian readily agreed. Then he glanced around and cautiously asked: "Mr. Yue, do you know who Old Cheng is? I don't have other intentions; I just want to understand a bit about my next patient."

"Of course, Old Cheng's name might not be unfamiliar to you." Yue Han smiled and slowly said: "Have you heard of Fengyuan Mining?"

"Fengyuan Mining? I've certainly heard of it. It's a well-known mining company both domestically and internationally."

Su Nantian certainly knew of this company. It was said to be a powerful mining development group, with its headquarters in Jiangcheng's high-tech development zone and being a state-supported leading industry.

Thinking of this, he suddenly recalled the big figure often seen on TV related to Fengyuan Technology. He immediately realized: "Mr. Yue, you mean Old Cheng is the chairman of Fengyuan Technology, Mr. Cheng Feng?"

"Ah, a promising student. It seems you're smarter than I thought." Yue Han nodded without showing any emotion.

Su Nantian's ability to guess Old Cheng's true identity wasn't surprising. If Su Nantian hadn't guessed or reacted quickly, there would be a problem.

He sighed and said: "My friendship with Old Cheng has lasted decades. We had similar situations when we started our businesses, but he has one advantage over me—he has a good wife, Ningyuan, who is an excellent supportive partner. For so many years, without her quiet support, he wouldn't have built such a big company alone."

"Yes, they are the model of a noble family."

Hearing this, Su Nantian nodded in agreement: "After decades of mutual support and loyalty, even the company is named after their two names."

At this point, Su Nantian instinctively glanced at Yue Han and lowered his voice: "Mr. Yue, does that mean Old Cheng is facing problems with his wife and needs a reliable method to solve this issue?"

"Yes, you know it well."

Yue Han didn't hide anything and answered straightforwardly: "Among the people I know, Old Cheng's situation is the most severe. His inner desire is also the most urgent. If you can cure him, he'll never have to worry about external matters for life."

"Ha! Alright."

Su Nantian was willing to accept Yue Han's goodwill: "Mr. Yue, let's agree on this. Later, find a time to invite Old Cheng out; I'll personally examine him and ensure the medicine works."

"Good, your confidence makes me feel at ease."
