The truth is, for those who play the guqin, a simple blue robe, an ancient zither, and a quiet pavilion nestled among mountains and rivers—such an atmosphere, such lofty solitude—is what the guqin truly embodies.

As for previous performances—whether it was dry ice effects, the crystalline zither, or sitting atop clouds—it all seemed a bit showy.

In such circumstances, it was actually detrimental to the audience's ability to be moved by the zither's sound and drawn into its world.

It was like after you performed these incredible feats, most of the audience's thoughts would still be preoccupied with how you achieved them. Their focus was insufficient, so how could they truly listen to your zither?"

Master Fang's words were simple and direct. At his age, he naturally had no need for subtlety or fear of offending anyone.

Suzhongtian listened attentively, nodding slightly. Many things he hadn't noticed before became clear after Master Fang's brief guidance, giving him a sense of sudden understanding.

Though it wasn't about skill, it was still very helpful to Suzhongtian.

Take today's performance: if those flashy elements were removed, the visual impact wouldn't be as shocking. But the zither's sound would certainly become more immersive and captivating.

After listening to Master Fang, Suzhongtian bowed slightly in gratitude.

Though Suzhongtian was naturally proud, he could distinguish between nitpicking criticism and genuine advice. And when it came to his shortcomings, he always accepted them humbly.

Seeing Suzhongtian's current popularity and his continued politeness and propriety, Master Fang's smile grew even warmer. Though they hadn't become master and disciple, becoming lifelong companions in the path of zither art was already quite remarkable.

Overall, this episode was a great success. Suzhongtian had gained another wave of fans through his own strength, and the name "Dixian" (Divine Immortal) had become extremely popular online. It even reached the trending list, though only in the top ten—enough to bring him significant benefits.

As soon as the program returned, before it was even aired, Suzhongtian could feel a massive increase in faith power. Once the program was broadcast, that growth would only accelerate.

Checking his Weibo account, he found that the number of followers under the verified account had exceeded one million.

Though for many celebrities, a million followers was nothing. But just a short while ago, Suzhongtian had been an unknown nobody.

Chapter 98: Enhancing Cultivation

The truth is, just a short while ago, Suzhongtian had been an unknown nobody. A million followers were truly a significant breakthrough for him.

Moreover, the number of fans was still increasing rapidly. The main reason was that rumors about "Dixian" had become legendary, sparking interest in this obscure person.

After searching for Suzhongtian's past videos because of these rumors, most girls had already become fans. Of course, some boys would curse him as a "face worshipper" and storm out in anger!

Suzhongtian found himself helpless, thinking his good looks still weren't enough to win over both men and women.

Moreover, this episode hadn't even been officially released yet. Only some snippets from the audience who had participated in the recording were circulating, and even no photos or images.

Suzhongtian had every reason to believe that once the program aired, a few more hot topics would push it even further.

Returning to Fengyue Community, Suzhongtian noticed that several girls were also exhausted! It was they who had been cheering from below during his performance, shouting the loudest.

Even today afternoon, Lin Suyun had officially established Suzhongtian's fan club, setting up a forum and groups.

It was truly remarkable in terms of organization and execution. Even many long-time fans of Suzhongtian acknowledged Lin Suyun's efforts.

From interests and daily habits, those who could know Suzhongtian so well were undoubtedly true fans. However, they never imagined that the one who truly understood Suzhongtian wasn't just a fan but also family—his wife!

After a brief explanation, Suzhongtian went to the training room to deal with his faith power.

On one hand, he had only reached the sixth level of Qi Cultivation, which wasn't high. On the other hand, his faith power was growing too fast.

In such a short time, Suzhongtian felt a bit swollen, like he had overeaten and was uncomfortable.

Actually, this was because of the "Shen Dao" (Divine Path). Imagine in the cultivation world, common people's lives were ignorant and naive.

How many people could there be in a village or town? A demon god running a few villages or even a city was already considered a great sect.

And then there were countless other godly beings waiting to cultivate.

But Suzhongtian's one million followers, even if all were new converts, would be enough to overwhelm him! That was an incredibly terrifying number—something even those demon gods couldn't imagine.

Indeed, the current Earth was the most desired environment for those who practiced the Divine Path! Of course, provided one found the right method.

Suzhongtian sat in a sealed chamber, his hands forming an incantation. A faint aura of authority gradually appeared—completely different from his usual demeanor.

Though his Divine Path cultivation was merely a supplement, the support of one million fans still allowed him to gather divine power.

Faith power gradually flowed out from his body. These crude, impure forces couldn't be directly absorbed or used.

Especially these fans' power was even more chaotic and wild than that of true believers.

Even Suzhongtian himself was surprised. He had never imagined fans would go so far for their idols!

One person's thoughts might not be many, but a million people's thoughts would definitely turn Suzhongtian into a madman.

After expelling all the faith power from his body, he sat cross-legged with hands folded at his lower abdomen.

Between his palms, a purple hollow spirit flame appeared! Like a weak flame flickering gently.

And those massive waves of faith power seemed to find their place, rushing toward that flame. Instantly, the purple hollow spirit flame blazed brightly, casting Suzhongtian's body in a deep violet.

The various thoughts and desires within the faith power became nourishment for the divine flame, making it grow stronger.

After burning away impurities, what remained was pure spiritual energy, which gradually merged into Suzhongtian's body.

As this energy integrated, his body changed bit by bit, and his cultivation level gradually increased.

After an unknown time passed, he suddenly felt his body empty. He stepped out of the cultivation state, realizing that all faith power had been used up.

It was no exaggeration to say that using faith power so freely was truly extravagant!

Thinking about it, Suzhongtian couldn't help but smile. In the cultivation world, Daoist and Buddhist sects had once fought over just a few hundred believers. Their perspectives were truly small.

Then again, he thought about himself—only one million fans—and how terrifying that was.

If big stars with hundreds of millions of followers could find the method to practice the Divine Path...

They might instantly become gods—powerful beings beyond imagination.

Suzhongtian stopped thinking about such things and carefully sensed his changes. After this cultivation session, he clearly felt a massive improvement in his abilities!

Previously, with the five pieces of spiritual stones' energy, he had barely reached the sixth level of Qi Cultivation. Now, with one million faith power units, he had instantly reached the peak of the sixth level!

Perhaps a sudden enlightenment could break through!

But even so, these weren't his biggest gains.

With a thought, an identical figure to Suzhongtian emerged from his body. The only difference was that this figure was slightly transparent, glowing with a faint golden light.

"Golden Body? So that's what it is..."

Suzhongtian felt a sudden understanding. In the two thousand years of cultivation, he had lived purely and never experienced this path of the Divine Path.

Originally, what was called a Buddhist golden body was just...

With another thought, the golden figure instantly merged into Suzhongtian's body. His entire skin glowed with a golden sheen, as if he had become the Buddha himself.

"Hey... it's just that simple."

His body's strength, previously like steel, had increased by about double. Suzhongtian felt that he could now withstand missiles.

At least, RPGs would be completely ineffective against him.

He withdrew the technique. A fist-sized purple hollow spirit flame floated beside him—this was his biggest gain!

Compared to the previous small flame like a lighter, this had grown by several times.

Chapter 99: The Aura of a Spirit Beast

After adjusting to his new state, he stepped out of the sealed chamber two days later and found it was already bright daylight.

He checked his phone to see what time it was. He realized it was the next morning.

At that moment, Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing were talking in the living room. It seemed someone had arrived.

When he entered the living room, Suzhongtian was surprised. The visitor turned out to be He Lao, the master carver of Liu Da Fu Jewelry!

"Hey, Master He, why have you come?"

Suzhongtian was a bit confused.

"South Tian Brother, you're awake! Master He has been waiting here for a long time. He said he had something important to talk about with you."

Seeing Suzhongtian come out, Lin Suyun introduced the situation to him and then led Gao Jingjing back to her room.

Men's matters shouldn't involve women, a lesson that Mom had taught her long ago.

After Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing left, Suzhongtian asked Master He again: "What's the matter, Master He? And I don't think I've told you my address before?"

To be honest, he wasn't very happy about people coming to his door like this. People who actively seek you out usually don't have simple intentions.

"Master Su, you're joking. In the entire Fengcheng business world, how many people don't know Lin Jia's daughter?

Finding her means finding Master Su! This time, it's not about Liu Da Fu. It's a personal matter of mine!

You see this..."

At that point, Master He seemed somewhat embarrassed and blushed. But he still placed the brocade box on the table, opening it toward Suzhongtian.

"This..."

Suzhongtian took the brocade box, his face darkening. Because what was inside was something he knew all too well—the very如意 (Ruyi) he had personally crafted at Liu Da Fu a few days ago!

He still clearly remembered that in this jade material, there had been a natural gathering spirit array.

Suzhongtian hadn't destroyed the array but sealed it within the Ruyi. Therefore, this jade Ruyi could technically be called an inferior artifact.

However, today when he looked at it, the Ruyi had already broken in half. The array inside was gone!

If Suzhongtian hadn't confirmed the material remained the same, he might have suspected it had been switched.

"Master Su, I heard you have a method to fuse jade. Could this Ruyi be salvaged?"

Suzhongtian looked at Master He for a moment, then nodded. He took the Ruyi and went to another room.

Within a tea's worth of time, Suzhongtian returned with the Ruyi intact.

Although he could mend it, the natural array inside was out of the question. He would have to reinsert a gathering spirit array. After thinking, he added a金刚阵 (Golden Armor Array), ensuring this Ruyi would never break in two again.

It was fortunate that Suzhongtian's hollow spirit flame had greatly improved, making the process of refining artifacts much easier. Otherwise, if it were still that small flame, he might not have been able to help.

Seeing Suzhongtian return with the complete Ruyi, Master He's worried expression finally turned into a smile, like a child who had fixed his toy.

Suzhongtian watched Master He's expression and couldn't help but smile. People with pure hearts had no ulterior motives, and they were more capable of deeply understanding and pursuing artistry.

"Master He, could you tell me how this Ruyi broke?"

Suzhongtian hadn't wanted to get involved in such matters, but sensing a special aura from the broken Ruyi, he changed his mind.

"Without lying to Master Su, yesterday this Ruyi was taken out by my ungrateful grandson. He seemed to show it off to his new girlfriend.

When he returned, I found the Ruyi broken. Perhaps he dropped it on the way."

Master He's explanation was somewhat vague, as it wasn't his own experience.

After seeing off Master He, Suzhongtian sat on the sofa, his gaze thoughtful.

On his fingertips, a faint blue aura continuously circled around, trying to break free but unable to leave its confines.

"Why does this world have such an aura?

Could it be that even in this desolate and backward world, where spiritual energy is so scarce, there are still spirit beasts?"

Suzhongtian was puzzled but also somewhat excited. If it truly were a spirit beast, then he and it would be quite compatible.

Spirit beasts refer to spirits born naturally by heaven and earth. Some are like normal creatures, while others are purely energy-based beings.

Even in the cultivation world, spirit beasts were rare and incomparable to the so-called demon tribes.

For every cultivator, a spirit beast was an opportunity that couldn't be missed and was quite powerful.

Humans and spirit beasts could coexist in a mutualistic relationship, exchanging abilities and talents.

After signing a contract with a spirit beast, humans could accelerate their cultivation speed.

Humans could also use the talent of a spirit beast—mutually beneficial.

If he truly encountered a spirit beast, Suzhongtian felt his heart ignite with excitement.

But this couldn't be rushed; he needed to plan carefully. If it was truly a spirit beast, it would likely come looking for him.

After all, it had stolen such a simple gathering spirit array. It must be struggling quite a bit.

For now, he would set this aside and return to his room. He needed to first settle a major matter: building an altar.

In the Divine Path, there were many rules about placing statues. If one offended a deity, it could truly bring divine punishment.

Of course, this would only happen in the cultivation world. Suzhongtian hadn't found any traces of deities on Earth.

Even the golden Buddhas in Buddhist temples had a lot of faith power, but they were still far from becoming deities through incense.

Moreover, even if one could become a deity through incense, it would be the weakest type of deity. It was nowhere near the level of the Buddha in legends.

Perhaps some temples were more effective, but it was just a glimmer of spiritual energy gathered by the masses.

Moreover, Suzhongtian's statue was to be dedicated to himself. Therefore, there were no such restrictions.

Would he punish himself?

Chapter 100: Su Yu Jian

Suzhongtian searched his room for a piece of high-quality jade. The hollow spirit flame burst out, continuously burning it.

At the same time, a golden translucent figure emerged from his body. It turned to look at Suzhongtian and then stepped into the purple flame.

As the golden figure merged, the purple flame's burning became faster. Gradually, the blue jade胚 (jade core) melted into liquid and then took shape under his spiritual awareness.

This was a jade statue, not very large—about half a meter. It seemed to have absorbed the golden body's essence, giving it a pale yellow hue.

The statue resembled Suzhongtian in about seven or eight parts, but it was also quite different. Compared to Suzhongtian's proud and defiant nature, this statue had a more refined and scholarly appearance.

He wore long hair tied in a bun, dressed in a blue robe. A six-sided Han sword hung at his waist, but with such an elegant and delicate appearance, the sword looked like a decoration.

After completing the jade statue, Suzhongtian carefully carved it for a while but didn't insert any arrays.

He found an altar and personally placed this jade statue inside it. He also set up a incense burner, several offerings in front of it and placed the statue in the living room.

From now on, this jade statue was Suzhongtian. Suzhongtian was this statue. This was the Divine Path's golden body and external manifestation!

After preparing everything, Suzhongtian lightly lit a jade incense. The purple divine flame ignited the incense head and placed it in the incense burner before the statue.

His expression wasn't overly respectful but rather casual. The jade statue in the altar playfully blinked at Suzhongtian and raised a hand to say thanks.

"Reclusive yet divine, a refined gentleman in the world of filth! From now on, you are Miss Su!"

Suzhongtian joked about himself, giving it a name. The statue remained calm and composed. After all, you are me, I am you. Others wouldn't recognize it; the embarrassment would be on you, so you can choose freely!

They were one person but not quite a person. This feeling was quite strange.

After lighting the incense, Suzhongtian felt a lightness in his body, as if all karmic burdens had vanished.

The faith lines connecting to his fans also transferred to this statue at that moment.

Visibly, the originally pale yellow jade statue gradually turned golden, as if it were truly made of gold.

From now on, this golden body was the refined gentleman of countless faiths. Suzhongtian was just Suzhongtian.

As soon as Suzhongtian finished arranging everything, Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing came out of their rooms. Seeing the jade statue in the living room, they were confused and asked:

"South Tian Brother, where did this jade statue come from? Why is it placed on an incense altar?"

Knowing more about such things, Gao Jingjing reminded: "South Tian Brother, I heard my grandfather say that statues shouldn't be taken lightly. There are many rules involved.

If you truly took a demon god, it might bring disaster. You don't think this is the old man's doing..."

Seeing them worry about him, Suzhongtian was quite happy. Still, he explained to them: "You should first look carefully and see who this is."

"Hey, isn't the face similar to South Tian Brother?"

"Of course. This is my previous life body. How could I harm myself?"

Suzhongtian spoke carelessly, as some things couldn't be explained.

The two girls still had some doubts but saw Suzhongtian's easygoing attitude and didn't take it too seriously.

In the afternoon, Lin Suyun took Gao Jingjing to the Lin Group. Now the entire Lin Group was under Lin Suyun and Suzhongtian's management. Suzhongtian was a lazy person, so he had to ask Lin Suyun to work more.

Suzhongtian stayed at home and took a nap. If it were before, he would have used the time for cultivation.

But now, cultivating was a complete waste of time. The spiritual energy on Earth was too thin. Sitting in meditation for ten or fifteen days would yield no results. He didn't want to waste years in seclusion.

Moreover, there was no need for him to cultivate now. There was this statue.

As long as his fans remained active and continued to support him, the countless bits of faith power would constantly flow into this statue, continuously enhancing the golden body's strength and his cultivation.

Using faith power for the Divine Path was much simpler than before. Suzhongtian would have envied it if it weren't for the fact that this statue was himself.

"Statue, statue. Maybe just call it Su Yu Jian!"

Suzhongtian lay in bed, constantly muttering. What name should his external manifestation have?

He had experienced giving names to others but never to himself, and especially not to another version of himself. This feeling was quite strange.

"Call me Su Yu Jian, no need for your help!"

As Suzhongtian was muttering to himself, he suddenly heard a familiar voice nearby.

This made him shocked. When had his vigilance become so poor that someone could approach within a meter without him noticing?

He did a somersault and stood up. He then realized there was someone standing next to him who looked quite similar but slightly more handsome.

Dressed in a blue robe, he had a sword at his waist and was holding a book. He looked quite showy!

Well, no wonder the voice was familiar. His own voice couldn't be unfamiliar.

"Hey! What demon are you? Come out now!"

Suzhongtian shouted and made an attack gesture.

But Su Yu Jian didn't even pay attention to him. His gaze seemed to be looking at an idiot.

Even Suzhongtian could sense a bit of disdain, as if he felt ashamed to have such an original body.

"Hey, what kind of look are you giving me? Don't add your own drama! According to the script, you should be standing in the altar now!

Also, do you think just because you have a jade sword on your waist can call yourself Yu Jian? Why not call yourself Green Arrow?"

"North Wind fires illuminate Ganquan, the Western Regions' General departs from Qilian. The sword of the Xiqu and the son of Liang family, a young hero with a white horse and golden saddle.

It's from Lu Sidao of the Sui Dynasty's "From the Army." No culture is truly terrifying!"

Su Yu Jian shook his head and closed the book. He took a step back into the altar.

Leaving Suzhongtian standing there... Was he being looked down on?

"What... what if you called yourself Su Xiqu? Or Su Bai Ma, Su Jin Ji?"

He was still trying to resist.

Su Yu Jian paused for a moment and then, without looking back, slipped into the altar. He remained motionless, as if it were a lifeless object.

Chapter 101: The Wu Family

Although Su Yu Jian didn't respect him and seemed to look down on him, Suzhongtian was still very happy.

After all, Su Yu Jian was himself. What did it matter if he looked down on him?

It could be said that for this Su Yu Jian, he was quite satisfied. Practicing the Divine Path by gathering a golden body from the faith of all beings.

At first, few could maintain clear minds. But now this Su Yu Jian was not only intelligent and sharp-minded but also had more knowledge than his original self.

This made Suzhongtian quite happy, though he didn't understand one thing. According to the rules, the thoughts and skills of a golden body should be the same as his own. So where did this Su Yu Jian's knowledge come from? He himself didn't know these things!

Also, when he created the statue, the only artifact was the six-sided Han sword at his waist. There was no book in Su Yu Jian's hand!

If Suzhongtian hadn't confirmed that Su Yu Jian was his golden body, he might have considered killing him.

After setting up the altar, Su Yu Jian no longer appeared. Seeing it was late, Suzhongtian went to bed and planned to have a good sleep.

With his current cultivation level, using meditation instead of sleep would be more effective. He'd wake up the next morning with a clear mind.

But Suzhongtian didn't want to do that. He had spent 20,000 years in the cultivation world. During those 20,000 years, the most pleasant thing he remembered was lying in bed and sleeping.

Of course, if there were a few beauties on the bed, it would be even better.

It could be said that in those 20,000 years, Suzhongtian had hardly slept. Every day was spent in cultivation or meditation.

Now that he had returned to Earth, Suzhongtian naturally felt good. His favorite thing was to sleep soundly.

With the current spiritual energy level on Earth, even if he meditated all night, the results would be minimal. Why bother doing something that was hard work and yielded no rewards?

Moreover, now he had Su Yu Jian. His Divine Path cultivation speed was ten times faster than his own night of meditation. Suzhongtian naturally wouldn't do such a pointless thing.

As the sky gradually darkened, Gao Jingjing and Lin Suyun had already gone to their respective rooms. Because Suzhongtian hadn't knocked on their doors that night, they had slept quite peacefully. It was unclear why.

But in this dark night, the statue placed in the living room's altar suddenly seemed to come alive.

It had apparently hidden some documents, and with a slight wave of his hand, the six-sided Han sword hung at his waist. As if a breeze had passed through, Su Yu Jian had disappeared from the altar.

Suzhongtian, who was sleeping in bed, had moved his ears slightly. He seemed to have noticed something, but after Su Yu Jian's actions, he didn't get up at all. Instead, he turned over and slept even more soundly.

Su Yu Jian could guess Suzhongtian's thoughts. For him, acting and himself were the same thing. Therefore, there was no need to act separately.

This statement wasn't wrong. In fact, it was true. In a way, Su Yu Jian could replace Suzhongtian himself.

But why did Su Yu Jian feel a slight anger when he was busy outside, looking at the one who was sleeping soundly in his room? It felt a bit uncomfortable.

Su Yu Jian stepped out of the room and carefully sensed. His lips slightly curled, revealing a gentle smile as he said softly: "Haha, interesting little fellow!"

He wasn't in a hurry. He seemed to have everything under control! However, when he reached the position where he sensed the aura, after searching for a while, he only found a few drops of blood!

This made Su Yu Jian's face change. This was the first time he had encountered such a situation since his debut.

His usual smooth sailing made him quite proud, thinking that the strong people in this world were no match. But he hadn't expected that just a small spirit beast could toy with him.

Yes, in Su Yu Jian's perception, the opponent was a spirit beast. And it seemed to have an unstable aura—actually, it was a wounded one!

For cultivators, spirit beasts were treasures from head to toe.

This phrase was used by ordinary people for certain animals. Later, these animals were said to be extinct. But for cultivators, it was used on spirit beasts. Now, even spirit beasts were about to follow in their footsteps.

Only a few major forces could master and sign contracts with spirit beasts, exchanging resources. They all kept it secret like a secret weapon.

Of course, Suzhongtian was the same. He wouldn't spread around that he could subdue spirit beasts. If he did, it would be a sign of insanity.

Some doubts arose: spirit beasts were naturally born and raised beings. Though they looked cute, their combat power wasn't low. It was difficult to injure them.

As Su Yu Jian pondered, a sudden aura fluctuation came from afar.

Accompanied by this obvious and unweakened fluctuation, a person appeared before him.

"Who are you? Why are you here?"

Before Su Yu Jian could ask, the person looked at his appearance and asked him first.

"Fengcheng, Lin Family."

Su Yu Jian thought for a moment before revealing the Lin family's identity. If he now claimed to be from the Lin family, it wouldn't be wrong.

"Lin Family? I've never heard of it!" The person didn't know whether it was truly unheard of or if he was saying that on purpose.

"I am the Grand Elder of Wu Family in Hezhou. I see you have some strength, help me find a raven. It's injured and should be nearby."

This so-called Wu family elder spoke on his own, seemingly never considering the possibility of being refused. After revealing his identity, he directly gave Su Yu Jian an order.

Su Yu Jian blinked and said nothing. He nodded instead, indicating he understood.

Clearly, this Wu elder had asked Su Yu Jian to find the raven—this spirit beast he sensed.

Before Su Yu Jian could ask anything, he had already exposed all the information himself. It was quite naive and cute.

At that moment, Su Nantian, who had been sleeping soundly at home, suddenly sat up. His eyes showed a thoughtful expression.

After a while, he shook his head helplessly.

"Really haven't heard of it! Hezhou Wu Family—was it another hidden cultivation family from other provinces?"

Chapter 102: Who Are You?

From the information Su Yu Jian relayed, this Wu elder was about the fifth level of Qi Cultivation. As a Grand Elder of the Wu family, this could be used to judge the family's strength.

To be honest, this Wu family was much stronger than the Gao family. Both were cultivation families, but the Gao family had clearly struggled.

Suzhongtian sat in bed thinking. His current cultivation level was the sixth level of Qi Cultivation, and he had another Su Yu Jian with equal strength.

If the Wu family's strength was as strong as this Grand Elder, it wouldn't be a problem.

But for this spirit beast, Suzhongtian was determined to get it. Now on Earth, encountering a spirit beast was already lucky. Missing this chance might mean never meeting one again.

From the Grand Elder's determination to kill the spirit beast, it was clear that the Wu family didn't know how to sign contracts with spirit beasts. It was truly a waste.

Thinking about this, Suzhongtian put on his clothes and went out. As he stepped into the living room, he saw Lin Suyun already preparing breakfast in the kitchen.

"South Tian Brother, what's wrong? It's early morning and you're going out?"

"Yes, Suyun. You all eat first. I have something to do."

Suzhongtian replied casually and stepped out of Fengyue Villa.

After sensing Su Yu Jian's position, Suzhongtian drove his Rolls-Royce towards the suburbs.

From Su Yu Jian's information, he and this Wu family Grand Elder should be near the abandoned buildings in the western suburbs.

So far, they hadn't found the spirit beast yet. But it should be nearby.

Arriving at the western suburbs' abandoned buildings, Suzhongtian didn't go to meet them. Instead, he went to the highest rooftop.

From his storage ring, he took out piece after piece of jade. He started setting up arrays according to the contract.

In his storage ring, he had prepared many square pieces of jade specifically for setting up arrays at any time.

Actually, in the cultivation world, arrays were usually set with spiritual stones. The effect was remarkable. But on Earth, the spiritual energy was scarce, and spiritual stones were even rarer—like protected animals.

Suzhongtian's array setting speed wasn't fast. This array was complex, and it was his first time setting one up. After all, this was just an array for signing a contract with a spirit beast—no combat means and no other functions.

No one would practice this kind of array for fun. As long as it could be used, that was enough.

But he wasn't in a hurry. He carefully set up each part to avoid any mistakes.

However, Suzhongtian didn't notice that while he was setting up the array, a black raven stood silently on a corner of the rooftop behind him.

Its crimson eyes were like two top-grade red rubies, staring intently at the array on the ground.

Signing a contract with a spirit beast was an equal contract. The cultivator would gain a talent from the spirit beast, and in return, the spirit beast would get fast cultivation speed.

In the cultivation world, signing a contract with a spirit beast was mutual. There was no coercion at all.

It was like finding a girlfriend now. Of course, there were times when one might not find the other appealing.

Because it was a contract with a spirit beast, Suzhongtian didn't know that this array could naturally be understood by any spirit beast. This raven was watching it with great interest.

It was a spirit beast that had suddenly mutated and awakened. It didn't have much knowledge or inheritance. Suddenly encountering an array it could understand, it was quite interested.

Moreover, this array seemed to be perfectly suited for it. There were no constraints at all.

Thinking about that, the raven flapped its wings and let out a call.

"Ga!"
