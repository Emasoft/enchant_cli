“Head trauma-induced unconsciousness can have various causes, but after examining him and finding no issues, he should wake up soon. However, his head did sustain a minor concussion, which is not serious—just ensure he doesn’t suffer another severe impact. As for when he’ll wake, it will take some time, but he’ll definitely be conscious by today.”

Hearing this, Nan Gong Yu Yan nodded.

“Doctor, thank you. Can we now take him back to his room? I mean, do we need to stay here?” Nan Gong Yu Yan felt the infirmary wasn’t entirely safe, believing their room was more secure.

The doctor nodded and said, “You may now take Nan Gong Shao back. If you wish, I can administer a nutrient injection to accelerate his recovery.”

The bodyguards wheeled Nan Gong Ping’s bed back to their room, and the doctor administered an intravenous nutrient shot.

After confirming Nan Gong Ping’s condition, the doctor left.

Once everyone had departed, Nan Gong Yu Yan folded her arms and turned to Su Nantian, saying, “Alright, this matter is temporarily resolved. Let’s discuss your issue now.”

Su Nantian was taken aback. His issue? What issue?

“Miss, what do you mean?” Su Nantian asked, puzzled.

Nan Gong Yu Yan’s expression darkened. This was no good sign. Su Nantian felt a flicker of doubt—had he merely interacted with the Huang family, and had Nan Gong Yu Yan discovered it so quickly?

But Su Nantian immediately realized this was merely his own speculation. When confronted with accusatory tones, one instinctively becomes defensive, replaying past actions. If his mental defenses were weak, he’d confess without being asked.

Yet clearly, Nan Gong Yu Yan had no idea about his contact with the Huang family—otherwise, she would have already uncovered who injured Nan Gong Ping.

Thus, Su Nantian deduced that Nan Gong Yu Yan’s actions must stem from another reason.

“How did you guard the young master? I heard you’ve risen to number one among our Nan Gong family’s bodyguards. I thought this trip would be safe with you by his side, but now he’s injured. Don’t you feel the need to reflect on your failure?”

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian finally understood she was confronting him. Indeed, his failure as a bodyguard had led to Nan Gong Ping’s injury.

Yet Su Nantian felt委屈 (wronged), as he had previously instructed Nan Gong Ping and Wang Meng to stay in the study. At that time, the study was the safest place—no one could enter unless the door was opened. Thus, he only needed to deal with those outside.

But Su Nantian hadn’t anticipated that while he was occupied with them, the study’s door opened, granting the attackers an opportunity to abduct Nan Gong Ping and Wang Meng.

This was why subsequent events unfolded.

Yet Su Nantian knew this wasn’t entirely his fault, but as Nan Gong Ping’s bodyguard, he bore responsibility for any incident involving the young master.

He lowered his head and said to Nan Gong Yu Yan, “Miss, I admit my negligence led to the young master’s injury. You may vent your anger on me; whatever punishment you decree, I will accept it fully.”

Nan Gong Yu Yan hadn’t expected Su Nantian to immediately take the blame. She had anticipated he might defend himself.

After all, when Su Nantian went with Wu Chuan to investigate, she had already questioned Wang Meng about the incident. Upon hearing his account, she immediately understood that Nan Gong Ping had ignored Su Nantian’s prior warning to stay in the study and opened the door himself, leading to this disaster.

If they had heeded Su Nantian’s instructions, this wouldn’t have happened.

Chapter 502: Vanished Without a Trace

Nan Gong Yu Yan was surprised that Su Nantian had immediately accepted blame, as most would deflect responsibility. Yet he said nothing and took full accountability for the consequences.

This earned her a faint admiration for Su Nantian, as such integrity was rare in today’s world. Moreover, his competence made her regard him with even greater respect.

“Alright, I understand the situation. But now isn’t the time for punishment. We haven’t left Wu’s estate yet, so you must continue protecting the young master. Once we return to the Nan Gong family, we’ll address this matter.”

After speaking, Nan Gong Yu Yan walked to a sofa and sat down. She had no intention of returning to her room—after all, everyone from the Nan Gong family was gathered here watching over Nan Gong Ping. It was safer for her to stay.

Su Nantian knew he would escape punishment this time. If Nan Gong Yu Yan truly wished to punish him, she could have done so immediately—but she hadn’t. Instead, her tone softened slightly, suggesting she wouldn’t pursue the matter further.

Even if Nan Gong Ping awoke, he likely wouldn’t punish him. After all, it was Nan Gong Ping’s own mistake that led to this situation. However, upon returning home, Nan Gong Lin would certainly impose some retribution—this was unavoidable.

Su Nantian stood obediently by Nan Gong Ping’s bed, flanking him with Wang Meng. After the incident, they wouldn’t leave his side again.

Yet Wu’s estate continued its search with no progress. Wu Chuan was overwhelmed, though he had Wang’s family as a contingency plan. Still, he viewed the alliance between Wang and Song as unstable.

Compared to the long-standing bonds of the Nan Gong and Huang families, Wu Chuan felt more secure. If he had fully trusted these two, he might have lost his advantage in the vote.

Moreover, Song and Wang combined only held two votes. Even if Nan Gong aligned with Huang, they would swiftly follow. Thus, Wu Chuan’s position remained weak, forcing him to confront the old guard within Wu family.

Not only did the main branch’s elders obstruct him, but so did the branch families. Wu Chuan also knew his legitimacy was questionable—he was merely an adopted son, so despite holding power, he couldn’t fully exert it.

This is why Wu Chuan hadn’t directly contested the heir position initially, instead expending great effort to find Wu Taotao and Wu You’er.

Because the Wu family still valued bloodline, even if they were branch members. But Wu Chuan himself was no blood relative—no matter how much power he held, he would never be recognized.

Even now, after finding Wu Taotao and Wu You’er to act as his puppets, Wu Chuan hoped they would hand over the position after two years. Yet he anticipated potential attacks from the old guard then. He even considered making Wu You’er and Wu Taotao his lifelong puppets.

Wu Chuan’s subordinates thoroughly searched the estate, but found nothing.

How could they? The culprit was hiding in the Huang family’s room, adopting another identity to pass their inspection—without a single flaw.

Unless they confessed or exposed themselves, or removed their makeup, no one would know they were the ones who injured Nan Gong Ping.

Thus, regardless of how many times Wu’s people searched, they’d find no clues.

“Sir, we’ve scoured the area repeatedly—no leads. We’ve checked all surveillance and sentinels, both inside and outside the estate, even patrolled the woods. Yet we found nothing.”

Wu Chuan’s assistant frowned as he reported, knowing Wu Chuan would be furious.

But there was no choice—his role required it.

Indeed, when Wu Chuan heard the report, his face darkened instantly. His expression was one of disbelief.

“What use are you? An incident occurred on Wu family grounds, and now we can’t even find the culprit! If someone were to assassinate me here, would you also fail to catch them? All our defenses are useless! I’ve spent so much money on these useless people!”

Wu Chuan grabbed a cup and smashed it against the floor. The cup shattered into pieces, some still containing tea that splashed onto his face.

Yet Wu Chuan’s assistant dared not speak, knowing any words would only anger him further. His years of experience told him to stay silent and let Wu Chuan vent, as he’d eventually regain composure.

To provoke him now would only make him more furious, possibly even demote him—losing money and being scolded was a loss.

Indeed, Wu Chuan’s assistant understood his mindset perfectly. After Wu Chuan finished venting, he finally calmed down and ordered, “Continue searching! Everyone except those preparing for the banquet must find the culprit before it starts!”

Chapter 503: Patience Pays Off

After receiving Wu Chuan’s order, the assistant nodded and left. Yet once outside, he quickly adopted another demeanor.

After all, he needed to vent his frustration on subordinates.

“You useless brutes! I feed you and yet you can’t find a few people after multiple searches. Find them again—everyone except those preparing the banquet must search for the culprit! If you don’t find him before the banquet, you can all pack your things and leave!”

With his order, they resumed searching the Wu estate.

Meanwhile, Wu Chuan sat in his room, restless. He knew he had to salvage the Nan Gong family’s support—though he’d already negotiated with Wang, he felt relying on Nan Gong was more secure.

Finally, Wu Chuan stood from the sofa and headed to Nan Gong Ping’s room, knowing all Nan Gong family members were there.

Su Nantian stood by the bed when he heard a knock. He approached the door, peered through the peephole, and saw it was Wu Chuan. He turned to Nan Gong Yu Yan and said, “Miss, it’s Wu Chuan.”

Upon hearing this, Nan Gong Yu Yan smiled. She had anticipated Wu Chuan’s visit.

Su Nantian noticed her expression and realized this was all within her plan—otherwise, she wouldn’t have told him Wu Chuan would “bleed” again.

It seemed Nan Gong Yu Yan had known all along that Wu Chuan would return to her.

Even though Wu Chuan had already negotiated with Wang, he still preferred Nan Gong for security.

“Let him in,” Nan Gong Yu Yan nodded and said to Su Nantian.

Su Nantian obeyed, opening the door.

Wu Chuan glanced at Su Nantian—this young man had been with him, and he must have already told Nan Gong Yu Yan about the Wang negotiations.

“Uncle Wu, what brings you here? Shouldn’t you be searching for the culprit instead?” Nan Gong Yu Yan feigned ignorance, lounging on the sofa as Wu Chuan entered.

“Yu Yan, I’ve ordered everyone to search again—no place left unturned. Look at my old body; even if I joined them, I’d be of no help. They’d have to take care of me, wasting time.”

Wu Chuan chuckled as he spoke, his tone unusually gentle.

After all, Wu Chuan now needed Nan Gong Yu Yan’s support—he couldn’t afford to be harsh.

After exchanging pleasantries, Wu Chuan steered the conversation toward the main topic. He glanced at Su Nantian and asked, “This young man is loyal to your Nan Gong family, isn’t he?”

Nan Gong Yu Yan smiled. She knew what Wu Chuan intended but didn’t engage directly. “He’s decent, skilled—but I never expected him to fail against four men and let the young master be injured. I’ll teach him a lesson when he returns.”

As she spoke, she glanced at Su Nantian as if blaming him. Yet Su Nantian knew this was merely a performance.

Wu Chuan chuckled awkwardly and said, “The culprit is indeed cunning. We’ve mobilized the entire Wu family without success. Still, we’ll continue searching. I just want to ask Nan Gong Miss—can our cooperation still be salvaged? Don’t let this incident break our partnership; it benefits both sides.”

Wu Chuan finally spoke his mind.

Nan Gong Yu Yan smiled again, glancing at Nan Gong Ping in bed before saying, “It’s not appropriate to discuss this here. Let’s go to my room instead.”

She stood, gesturing to Su Nantian: “You come with me. There are no guards there—everyone’s been moved here. If I met Uncle Wu alone and encountered the culprit again, it would be dangerous. You must guard carefully this time.”

Su Nantian nodded solemnly, “Miss, trust me. This won’t happen again.”

Thus, Su Nantian followed Nan Gong Yu Yan and Wu Chuan into the adjacent room.

Nan Gong Yu Yan sat on the sofa, addressing Wu Chuan: “I thought Uncle Wu wouldn’t come to me. You’ve already negotiated with Wang, haven’t you?”

Wu Chuan chuckled, having anticipated Su Nantian would inform him. Yet he was surprised Nan Gong Yu Yan remained so composed.

“Ah, Nan Gong Lin has such a daughter—it’s admirable. She’s far more composed than her brother.” Wu Chuan began without addressing the issue directly, praising Nan Gong Yu Yan.

Su Nantian, standing nearby, shook his head. Wu Chuan was clearly trying to ingratiate himself with Nan Gong Yu Yan to gain her favor.

But Su Nantian knew this tactic wouldn’t work on Nan Gong Yu Yan. Clever as she was, she wouldn’t be swayed by a few compliments.

Moreover, the Nan Gong family maintained good internal relations. Their success over the years stemmed from unity against external threats.

Indeed, while everyone knew Nan Gong Ping and Nan Gong Yu Yan were vying for support to secure the inheritance, they never allied with other families.

Chapter 504: Raising the Stakes

After Wu Chuan spoke, Nan Gong Yu Yan showed no reaction. She stared at him intently, as if waiting for his next move—uninterested in his praise.

Wu Chuan realized his flattery had failed, and he chuckled awkwardly, rubbing his nose. “I know this young man must have told you about my meeting with Wang. I didn’t expect it, so I feel no guilt. But Wang’s people wanted to discuss business—I had to respond; I couldn’t refuse.”

After speaking, Wu Chuan sat on the sofa beside Nan Gong Yu Yan and continued: “You know Wang’s people—they’re stubborn. If I had refused, it would’ve been bad for me. So I had to talk.”

Nan Gong Yu Yan smiled, “I think Uncle Wu is afraid we Nan Gongs won’t vote for you, so you’re seeking another option.”

Her words hit the mark. Wu Chuan could only laugh awkwardly. They had all lied countless times, and being caught was common—yet this wasn’t embarrassing; lies were merely tools to maintain surface peace.

“Why did Uncle Wu come here now? You’ve already negotiated with Wang—why return to us Nan Gongs? Are you trying to get double benefits?”

Nan Gong Yu Yan played with her fingers, her new manicure vibrant and lively, like herself.

“Don’t overthink it. How could I risk both sides? That would anger both Nan Gong and Wang, leaving me no room to maneuver. Besides, you know Wu family has a feud with Huang. At this time, other options are necessary.”

Wu Chuan smiled, no trace of embarrassment.

Su Nantian recalled the information Song Lichen had given him earlier—Wu and Huang families had a history of conflict. Thus, Wu Chuan’s mention of Huang wasn’t surprising.

“What are your current thoughts, Uncle Wu? Are you leaning toward Wang or continuing cooperation with us Nan Gongs? Naturally, we have no objections to your choice.”

Nan Gong Yu Yan remained calm, concealing her urgency.

Internally, she was anxious—losing Wu’s cooperation would mean this trip was in vain, and Nan Gong Ping’s injury was a loss. Moreover, Wu’s initial offer had been tempting; the port revenue was massive, and securing half would yield great profit.

Thus, if Wu switched to Wang, they’d gain huge profits and potentially suppress Nan Gong in the short term. This was unacceptable for Nan Gong.

“Of course, I want to continue cooperating with Nan Gong. Let me be honest—Wang’s people had two votes, and they wanted to ally with Song. But how could their alliance compare to yours and Huang’s? I believe your partnership is more stable.”

Wu Chuan openly revealed the details of his talks with Wang, unguarded. He clearly wanted to mend ties with Nan Gong.

“Uncle Wu, they say a good horse doesn’t eat the same grass twice. I’ll be direct—your current search progress is pitiful. Not only before the banquet, but even after it, you’d find no culprit. So why ask us Nan Gongs to continue cooperating? You must show more sincerity.”

Nan Gong Yu Yan finally addressed the issue. Her goal was to secure more benefits for Nan Gong. She also realized the perpetrator had planned this carefully; even with Wu’s continued search, they’d never find them.

Her earlier threat to stop cooperation was a setup—she hadn’t expected Wang to intervene, but Wu’s timely return made it work.

Upon hearing this, Wu Chuan laughed and clapped his hands: “I knew you were waiting for me. Tell me, how much more do you want?”

Su Nantian was surprised Wu Chuan willingly let Nan Gong Yu Yan raise the stakes.

“Add a quarter more.” Nan Gong Yu Yan raised her hand, making a “four” sign.

“You’re being too harsh. We already split the profits evenly. Now you want another half? That leaves Wu only a quarter.” Wu Chuan clearly refused, as the demand was excessive.

“But it’s just one year for a stable family head position. Isn’t that worth it? And during this year, if Wu wants to cooperate commercially with Nan Gong, we’ll prioritize you. Moreover, having this person as head is like having you in the house. This inexperienced girl would be at your mercy, allowing you to manipulate behind the scenes—how convenient!”

Nan Gong Yu Yan spoke clearly, waiting for Wu Chuan’s approval.

“Say, if Nan Gong wants to cooperate later, will you prioritize us?” Wu Chuan clearly was tempted and asked for specifics.

Su Nantian already anticipated the negotiation’s outcome—Nan Gong Yu Yan would get her way, and Wu Chuan would agree to her conditions.

“Of course. I speak with authority; my father has fully entrusted me.” Nan Gong Yu Yan said confidently.

Chapter 505: Calculations

Su Nantian chuckled inwardly upon hearing Nan Gong Yu Yan’s words. Clearly, Nan Gong Lin knew which child was more intelligent and capable—otherwise, he wouldn’t have entrusted this power to Nan Gong Yu Yan instead of Nan Gong Ping.

No wonder Nan Gong Ping hadn’t immediately agreed to the terms he’d heard; he needed to consult with Nan Gong Yu Yan first.

Yet Nan Gong Ping remained unaware that this trip’s decisions were made by Nan Gong Yu Yan, still believing it was a mutual agreement.

At this moment, Wu Chuan scratched his head and nodded: “Fine. If Nan Gong truly keeps its word, giving you more is acceptable. But now it’s just words—let’s draft a contract to ensure mutual trust.”

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian reevaluated Nan Gong’s power. The right to prioritize commercial cooperation alone made Wu Chuan so concerned, proving how much he could gain from cooperating with Nan Gong.

Even giving up three-quarters of the inland port’s rights, Wu Chuan would agree.

“Good, Uncle Wu is a man of principle. Let’s sign the contract now. If this deal goes through, you’ll hand over the inland port rights to Nan Gong. In return, Nan Gong will prioritize Wu family cooperation for the next year. This ensures mutual trust.”

Nan Gong Yu Yan was delighted, though in past experiences, no one had signed contracts beforehand. These families knew each other well; promises were always kept, or else others would sanction them.

But this time, signing a contract was a relief for Nan Gong Yu Yan—ensuring Wu Chuan wouldn’t betray and switch to Wang or Song.

After agreeing, they quickly found the room’s computer to draft the contract. Since it didn’t involve detailed clauses, drafting was swift—within minutes, they printed a draft.

After printing two copies, they signed and pressed their fingerprints—finalizing the deal.

“Alright, Nan Gong will honor our agreement and vote for your candidate.” Nan Gong Yu Yan smiled, storing the contract.

“Nan Gong also assures you inland port matters will be fulfilled.”

After speaking, Wu Chuan stretched and stood up, saying to Nan Gong Yu Yan: “I’ll now urge them to continue searching for the culprit who injured the young master. Please stay here and attend the banquet.”

Wu Chuan claimed he was going to urge people, but in reality, he returned to his room. The contract was signed; whether the culprit was found or not no longer mattered.

This additional cost Wu Chuan paid was essentially covering Nan Gong Ping’s medical expenses, though it was quite expensive. Yet the benefit of prioritizing cooperation with Nan Gong for a year was worth it for Wu.

Wu Chuan could already sense the smooth sailing ahead—cooperating with Nan Gong, and with Huang behind them, even if they weren’t on good terms, they’d appear harmonious in Nan Gong’s eyes.

This left only Wang and Song—though they could unite to vote for him, their commercial interests would never intertwine.

Especially Song, always opportunistic—wherever there was profit, they’d appear. They never aligned with a single force.

Thus, after this division of power, Wu’s year would be much smoother.

After Wu Chuan left, Nan Gong Yu Yan finally relaxed and slumped onto the sofa, glancing at the contract she’d stored with a happy expression.

Su Nantian realized Nan Gong Yu Yan was merely in her early twenties. Born into the Nan Gong family, she bore heavy burdens while vying for inheritance.

But now that she’d completed this major task, it was time to relax.

Yet Nan Gong Yu Yan immediately remembered Su Nantian was still standing nearby, and she quickly regained her composed demeanor, sitting upright on the sofa. Her face had a faint blush—embarrassed she’d let her guard down in front of him.

Su Nantian coughed and said, “Miss, if we can’t find the culprit, will we still cooperate with Wu?”

Nan Gong Yu Yan nodded, shaking the contract in her hand. “Of course. The contract is signed, and we’ve gained more benefits from this incident. Thus, the young master’s injury wasn’t in vain. Besides, for him, there was no real danger.”

Nan Gong Yu Yan now revealed her true business nature—if she could gain more benefits from Nan Gong Ping’s injury, it was worth it.

“Moreover, you’ve been searching with Wu Chuan. You know better than I how many people they’ve deployed. I certainly believe they’re all working on this now.”

“But after so much searching inside and out, these culprits have vanished like ghosts. This shows they were well-prepared—now hidden where Wu can’t find them. No matter how much longer they search, they won’t find the culprit before the banquet. If I insist on not voting for him until the culprit is found, we’ll gain nothing and the young master’s injury will be in vain.”

Nan Gong Yu Yan revealed her true thoughts. Su Nantian marveled at how clearly she calculated her moves.

Chapter 506: Notification

After learning Nan Gong Yu Yan’s plan, Su Nantian realized he hadn’t misjudged her. From his interactions with Nan Gong Yu Yan and Nan Gong Ping, he had long concluded that she was far more mature in both skill and mindset than Nan Gong Ping. From the Nan Gong family’s perspective, if they had to choose between the two for succession, Su Nantian would definitely pick Nan Gong Yu Yan.

Yet he didn’t understand why Nan Gong Lin still supported Nan Gong Ping at this time. But surely, Nan Gong Lin wasn’t foolish enough to let parental affection dictate such a decision.

After all, Nan Gong Ping was clearly unfit to fully inherit the family’s leadership and determine its future. If Nan Gong Lin allowed this son to take over, it would lead the family toward destruction step by step.

“Don’t just stand there. Go inform Huang’s people now. Tonight, we’ll still vote for Wu Chuan. Don’t let this incident change their voting target—otherwise, we’ll gain nothing. Also, tell them the benefits won’t be small this time; let them vote quietly.” Nan Gong Yu Yan waved, instructing Su Nantian to notify Huang.

Su Nantian nodded and said, “I’ll go now.”

Thus, Su Nantian obeyed Nan Gong Yu Yan’s command and headed downstairs.

This time, when he arrived at Huang’s door, the guards didn’t stop him—they opened the door and let him in.

Huang Zhizhong and Huang Zhiwei sat on the sofa, deep in thought. Upon seeing Su Nantian enter, they were surprised—what was he doing here?

“You’re back again. Is there something to tell me?” Huang Zhizhong stood immediately, speaking respectfully. After all, their survival this time relied on Su Nantian’s exceptional disguise skills. Without his help, they would’ve been discovered after a few searches by Wu Chuan’s people.

Su Nantian smiled and said, “I’m here on my Miss’s orders. She said we’ll still vote for Wu Chuan tonight.”

“What? Still vote for Wu Chuan? But this major incident with Nan Gong is entirely due to Wu’s failure to protect. And now they haven’t caught the culprit. How can Nan Gong Miss tolerate this and still cooperate with Wu?” Huang Zhiwei stood up in surprise, believing Nan Gong would no longer cooperate.

Mainly, if Nan Gong confirmed they wouldn’t support Wu, they’d have a reason to vote for Wu Ruotian. Then it would prove they had a chance to gain a share of the oil field.

Su Nantian shook his head dismissively and approached them, patting their shoulders: “I advise you two to wake up. This oil field development is such a big move—do you think Wu’s branch can keep it hidden forever? Once Wu Chuan’s main family discovers it, they’ll use every means to reclaim it. You won’t gain anything by participating.”

Clearly, Huang Zhizhong and Huang Zhiwei were blinded by the oil field. They believed they’d definitely gain benefits, as Wu Ruotian had said—even if he didn’t become the heir, they’d get a share if they voted for him.
