“Stop! I’m not interested.” Bai Suxi’s fleeting curiosity was extinguished once more by Su Nantian’s incessant chatter.

“Let’s talk about something else.”

Su Nantian couldn’t help but speak to Bai Suxi, whose beauty was undeniable despite her cold demeanor.

“I have nothing to say to you. After all, I’m now in your hands—kill or maim as you please.”

Bai Suxi adopted a resigned expression.

“You’re wasting your looks. All you talk about is killing and fighting—how dull.”

Su Nantian sighed in exasperation.

“Even if you don’t say who you are, at least tell me why you wanted to kill Yang Yuanyong.”

Bai Suxi glanced at Su Nantian and said, “I don’t know why I was ordered to kill him. My mission was simply to eliminate him; the rest is none of my concern.”

“Come on! You don’t even have a grudge against him, yet you kill him for money?”

Su Nantian said this with a hint of disdain.

“Money is the reason, but what use is money to me?”

Bai Suxi’s first sentence answered Su Nantian’s question, while the second seemed like a self-reflective mumble, as if she herself was confused.

Since the age of ten, when her parents were murdered by a man in a black cloak, Bai Suxi had never smiled again. At that time, the leader of the Honey Badger Organization, “Honey Badger King,” happened to pass by her home and took Bai Suxi from Sichuan Province abroad, raising her as his own daughter. Since joining the Honey Badger Organization, her life had consisted solely of eating, sleeping, and relentless training. At first, she was beaten by older children until her body was battered. Yet she never cried again like when her parents died; the young girl was remarkably resilient. Her efforts bore fruit—years of rigorous training and her innate talent, driven by a firm goal, enabled her to defeat or kill those who once dominated her. By the age of twenty or so, she had become a top-tier assassin in the Honey Badger Organization!

Chapter 88: Let You Go

At one time, Bai Suxi believed she had reached the pinnacle of her power. Her sole remaining goal was to find the man in black cloak and avenge her parents’ blood.

But meeting Su Nantian had shattered all her previous beliefs. She felt as if she were reliving the days when she was crushed by older children during her training.

Seeing Bai Suxi’s beautiful face suddenly marred by deep sorrow, Su Nantian felt a pang of sympathy.

“This girl was just trying to kill me with all those attacks, but she doesn’t seem like a bad person. Perhaps she has her reasons.”

Since arriving on Earth, Su Nantian’s cultivation progress had been lackluster, but his ability to be tender-hearted had improved rapidly!

Just as he was about to say something to break the silence, Bai Suxi spoke first.

“Who are you to Yang Yuanyong?”

Bai Suxi’s expression had shifted from sorrow to one of calmness, as if the cloud of worry had never existed. Her years of endurance and training had transformed her into a mature woman, no longer the fragile girl she once was. Yet this time, her tone toward Su Nantian was gentler, with less hostility.

“I don’t have any special relationship with him. To be precise, I just met him today.”

Su Nantian said this and thought it was accurate.

“Then why did you save him? Were you hired as his bodyguard?”

Bai Suxi was puzzled.

“That’s even more incorrect! I’m only their bodyguard for my girlfriend and my younger sister, Jingjing. Not for anyone else.”

How could a supreme immortal from the celestial realm be a bodyguard for an ordinary man? That was Su Nantian’s inner thought.

“But…” Su Nantian changed his tone. “Yang Yuanyong is my Jingjing’s grandfather and a friend of Master Gao Qingyun. I couldn’t just stand by and watch him die.”

Su Nantian didn’t know how he had spoken so smoothly.

“Gao Qingyun, Jingjing… Are you from the Gao family?” Bai Suxi asked again.

“Sister, are you hit on the head? I said my name is Su Nantian. The ‘Su’ here means ‘soul,’ not the Gao family.”

Su Nantian was speechless.

Yet he was also startled. The Gao family must be quite famous, since even the assassin organization knew of it.

In fact, Bai Suxi had no idea about the true nature of the Gao family. After all, foreigners only believed in “science,” and they had no understanding of cultivation.

Bai Suxi’s mission to Fengcheng involved not only gathering information on Yang Yuanyong but also understanding the local power structures. In her view, the Gao family was merely a regional clan.

“Okay,” Bai Suxi seemed to pay no attention to what Su Nantian said. At that moment, the sorrow on her face returned.

Su Nantian felt a bit troubled as Bai Suxi remained silent.

“If I handed her over to the Fengcheng patrol, it wouldn’t be useful anyway.”

“After all, she was just following orders. As for the mastermind behind it, I don’t think she would confess.”

“Also, she’s so beautiful but assassinated a local official. That crime is quite serious. Maybe…”

Su Nantian suddenly had an idea.

“Let’s make a deal.”

Hearing Su Nantian’s words, Bai Suxi snapped out of her daze. Her face was devoid of hostility and instead wore a bewildered, cute expression.

This made Su Nantian glance at her more than once.

“What kind of deal?” Bai Suxi asked.

Seeing Su Nantian staring at her with almost lecherous eyes, she understood his intention. Immediately, her face turned cold: “If you try to take advantage of me, don’t bother. I’ll commit suicide!”

Bai Suxi mistakenly thought Su Nantian was a lecher.

“Come on! What’s wrong with you, sister? Can’t you think of something normal for once!”

“I have a girlfriend. I’m not the kind of person you’re thinking of! I’m really fed up!”

“I mean, if you tell me who you are—your name or even a code name—I’ll let you go. Deal?”

Su Nantian grumbled impatiently.

“This man is really strange,” Bai Suxi thought. As an international A-grade assassin, she had never encountered someone as unconventional as Su Nantian.

Yet inexplicably, despite only meeting him for the first time and even being opponents moments ago, she felt a sense of trust in Su Nantian without suspecting any tricks.

Perhaps it was because Su Nantian had shown no intention of harming or bullying her since their fight, while she herself had been seeking death.

At once, Bai Suxi said: “Okay. I’ll tell you. My name is Bai Suxi. I was originally from Sichuan Province, China. Now I am a member of the Honey Badger Bounty Hunter Organization.”

Su Nantian listened carefully. After Bai Suxi finished speaking, he said: “Okay, I remember that, Bai Suxi.”

“See how simple it was? You should have told me from the beginning. Why did you fight with me instead of just telling me? It was such a waste of time!”

Bai Suxi rarely had friends and seldom spoke to people. Meeting Su Nantian, a chatterbox, left her unsure how to respond. So she simply nodded and said softly: “Oh.”

“Come on! What’s wrong with you, sister? Did you get hit by a foreigner?”

“You don’t know that ‘oh’ and ‘huh’ are two words with extreme hostility, right? You can’t say them casually or you’ll get beaten!”

“No, I guess no one could beat you anyway. Anyway…”

Su Nantian’s mouth was as unstoppable as a broken car.

“Okay, I understand,” Bai Suxi surprisingly responded with a gentle attitude.

In fact, Su Nantian didn’t know what his presence meant to Bai Suxi. As a top-tier assassin, she never lacked money but had no friends to joke with. Her most frequent interactions were brief conversations with the Honey Badger King during missions.

Although Su Nantian’s contact was brief, it felt like a new door had opened in her world, waiting for exploration.

“White Cat, you’re having fun with a new friend,” came an unsolicited voice.

Su Nantian, who was usually alert, had failed to notice anyone approaching due to being entranced by Bai Suxi’s beauty.

Su Nantian turned around and saw a woman with shoulder-length purple hair, wearing a sexy leather outfit. She was petite but had an alluring aura and tanned skin. Her face wore a playful smile.

“Zi Hu, why did you come?” Bai Suxi asked with alertness.

Chapter 89: Reencountering Wang Long

The woman’s appearance had gone unnoticed by Su Nantian. Seeing this uninvited figure, he slightly frowned.

Although he seemed carefree, he disliked things beyond his control.

When facing Bai Suxi, Su Nantian had mostly been playing around. Now he was somewhat serious.

Although he had momentarily lost himself, the fact that she could approach so close without being detected was impressive.

“Hey hey, I noticed your organization has high-quality women! First a pure one, then another seductive one?”

Though cautious, he smiled and asked Zi Hu.

This Zi Hu was also a beauty matching Bai Suxi. She seemed to be of mixed heritage, with a healthy tan skin and a petite figure that was curvaceous. Her typical South Asian thick lips were particularly alluring, drawing Su Nantian’s gaze involuntarily.

Her voice wasn’t clear but had a husky quality, which was alluring in itself.

If Bai Suxi was a pure white lotus untouched by worldly matters, this Zi Hu was truly a fox spirit—captivating and mesmerizing!

At some point, Su Nantian’s gaze became dazed, his face showing a痴迷 expression. Zi Hu had already appeared beside Bai Suxi.

“Little handsome guy, you’re strong—exactly the type of man I like! But today I have other things to do, so I won’t play with you.”

Zi Hu smiled and pulled Bai Suxi’s hand, slowly retreating into the shadows.

Seeing Zi Hu taking Bai Suxi away, Su Nantian’s dazed expression vanished instantly. His lips curled slightly with a hint of seductive mischief.

He snapped his fingers, and purple flames flickered on his fingertips. He lit a cigarette and took a slow puff.

“Bai Suxi? Zi Hu? Haha, interesting!”

Although he didn’t sense anything from Bai Suxi, Su Nantian noticed that Zi Hu was not ordinary. Though different from the cultivation methods of China or those he had encountered before, there were definitely signs of cultivation.

From her energy fluctuations, Su Nantian roughly estimated she was at the second level of cultivation. However, there seemed to be other special abilities—she had momentarily masked her presence from Su Nantian.

Su Nantian realized his current cultivation method must have some issues. Though he had reviewed it several times without finding major flaws, he was always drawn to women—this was truly awkward.

Su Nantian would never admit it was his problem. After all, in the cultivation world, he had cultivated for 20,000 years without indulging in women. There was no reason to lose control upon returning to Earth.

Perhaps he should visit abroad when he had time, collecting various cultivation methods. Maybe by learning from different schools, he could achieve some progress.

Shaking his head, Su Nantian put the matter aside and turned back along the original path.

He didn’t know this area at all, with its messy streets easily leading to disorientation. Bai Suxi had chosen this route because she noticed that.

Fortunately, Su Nantian’s memory was strong. Though he wasn’t good at navigation, he could return by memory.

Otherwise, a cultivation master of the sixth level getting lost would be a huge joke.

After leaving this abandoned area, Su Nantian finally reached the main road. He hailed a taxi and called Lin Suyun.

“Hey, wife! Where are you all? Where’s Master Gao?”

Lin Suyun received Su Nantian’s call and her face slightly blushed. She mentally cursed but noticed the surrounding elders watching her, so she awkwardly stuck out her tongue.

“Nantian, I’m with Master Gao and the others at Yang’s house. He specifically asked you to come over.”

“Oh? Then it's perfect. I’ve been busy all this time and am a bit hungry now.”

Lin Suyun provided the address, and Su Nantian told the driver. He hung up.

At this point, the taxi driver said excitedly: “Hey boss, fate! Finally found you!”

Su Nantian was startled. He looked at the driver several times before recognizing him—this was the guy he met a few days ago who had been displaced from his home!

Su Nantian remembered giving him a racing engine. He didn’t know if he had modified it.

“Is it you? What’s your name? The engine I gave you—was it useful? Did you install it in this car?”

Su Nantian, seeing a familiar face, chatted with him for a while. The driver was quite talkative and left a good impression on Su Nantian.

“Boss, my name is Wang Long. The thing you gave me was really useful! I’m not bragging, but with that engine installed in my car, a few days ago I raced against two Ferraris and those guys couldn’t beat me!”

“Boss, you don’t know. I drive a taxi now, but no one could pay me two million to sell it!

What’s a car? A car is my wife! I’ve been with her for years, and finally got her a better upgrade. How could I sell it?”

Wang Long was also talkative, and once he opened his mouth, he couldn’t stop. He chatted with Su Nantian endlessly and even managed to confuse him a bit.

He could possibly succeed in making a talisman with some materials, but trying to figure out how to modify a car was pure nonsense. Su Nantian didn’t understand what Wang Long said, but he listened with interest as Wang Long talked about power transmission and various modifications from theory to practice.

Without realizing it, they arrived at the entrance of Yang Yuanyong’s residential area.

As the leader of Fengcheng, Yang Yuanyong hadn’t been ostentatious and lived in a government compound. Of course, nowadays the government compound was no longer just an old courtyard but a modern residential area.

As Su Nantian got out of the car, he felt dozens of eyes watching him. The security was clearly very strong.

He didn’t care about the stares, knowing they were just Yang Yuanyong’s protectors. He had been invited, so he didn’t need to worry about them. Moreover, these people were nothing to Su Nantian.

Maybe they were iron-blooded soldiers who had been on the battlefield and killed enemies. But to Su Nantian, they were just little brothers.

With a cultivation master’s strength compared to ordinary people, it was completely overwhelming.

He walked confidently into the front door without encountering any ridiculous security issues.

A middle-aged man in his thirties, dressed elegantly, was waiting at the entrance. Seeing Su Nantian approach, he bowed and asked: “You must be Mr. Su Nantian. I’m Lai Fu, the housekeeper of Yang’s residence. Master Yang is waiting for you inside. Please follow me.”

This was a standard housekeeper, and even Su Nantian, who had seen various high-class households in the cultivation world, found no fault with his etiquette.

However, this man’s attire and demeanor made Su Nantian think. Yang Yuanyong’s public identity was the leader of Fengcheng, but there must be more to his true identity.

The Gao family was among the top in Jiangzhou, with influence across all industries and both legal and illegal sectors. Even so, Su Nantian hadn’t encountered such treatment in the Gao family. It wasn’t that Master Gao had neglected him, but rather an accumulation of prestige and depth.

Who could say that the current social status of the Gao family was stronger than Yang Yuanyong’s? But when it came to depth, perhaps they weren’t as good.

Just from this housekeeper alone, one could see the depth of Yang Yuanyong’s background.

Su Nantian thought this as he walked forward with the housekeeper, and after a while, they arrived at Yang’s front door.

The housekeeper knocked on the door and indicated for Su Nantian to go first. Su Nantian didn’t hesitate and walked in. He saw a group of people sitting on the sofa in the living room, waiting for him.

Yang’s house was a villa but not very large—around 200 square meters.

Normally, only Yang Yuanyong and his wife lived here, with the housekeeper as well.

“Nantian, you’re back! Come sit down and tell us what happened. Who was it that wanted to assassinate Yang?”

It was Master Gao Qingyun who greeted Su Nantian. He was sitting at the head of the table, although this was Yang’s house.

Next to him sat Yang Yuanyong and his wife, a woman whose face was indistinct.

Although Su Nantian had recently become more lustful due to his cultivation method, he at least believed it was because of the method.

But he wasn’t desperate and didn’t look too closely.

Below them were Lin Tianyi, Lin Suyun, and Gao Jingjing. Zhang Zhen had other things to do and wasn’t present.

Originally, Master Gao Qingyun wanted to send Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing back to Fengyue Residential Area, but the two girls were worried about Su Nantian’s situation. So they had to follow him.

Su Nantian sat down confidently and asked Yang Yuanyong: “Master Yang, do you have any enemies in your daily life?”

Su Nantian’s question made Yang Yuanyong thoughtful. He frowned and thought for a long time before finally shaking his head and explaining to Su Nantian:

“If there are enemies, it’s countless. I’m in this position, so I’ve blocked many people’s paths to wealth.

There are countless people who want to kill me in Fengcheng and even Jiangzhou. I don’t know how many there are.

But recently, I haven’t offended anyone, so I have no suspects.”

After hearing Yang Yuanyong’s words, Su Nantian had no solution. After all, even if he was a cultivation master, he wasn’t a prophet. Although he occasionally did divination and fortune-telling, it wasn’t all-powerful.

Moreover, about this aspect, he himself was not skilled. The small Taoist in the Gao family was more proficient.

“Assassins from Africa, an organization called Honey Badger. This time it was a professional assassin with the code name White Cat. I fought him, and his skills were not weak. He escaped, but I managed to get some information from him.”

Su Nantian briefly recounted his experience. He told them what he had learned and then stopped talking.

Yang Yuanyong and Gao Qingyun exchanged glances, exchanging silent messages without saying much.

Clearly, they were all old foxes and not easy to deal with. Su Nantian’s information should be trusted, but about letting White Cat escape, they each had their own thoughts.

Gao Qingyun had seen Su Nantian’s strength and didn’t believe anyone could escape from his grasp. Unless... he had done it intentionally!

Obviously, some things weren’t suitable to say in front of Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing. So after a brief conversation, Yang Yuanyong sent the three of them back to Fengyue Residential Area.

Before leaving, Yang Yuanyong solemnly gave Su Nantian a private business card. The background was black, with gold letters and red cloud patterns.

On this well-crafted business card were only the three characters “Yang Yuanyong” and a private number.

This kind of business card represented recognition, and only those who were extremely valued would receive it from Yang Yuanyong.

Now Su Nantian had received one, making Lin Tianyi and Gao Qingyun slightly shocked.

Lin Tianyi hadn’t expected even Yang Yuanyong to value Su Nantian so much. He realized he had underestimated his son-in-law, although he had already overestimated him several times.

Gao Qingyun, on the other hand, was thinking that Yang Yuanyong wasn’t a good person and must be scheming against Su Nantian.

Fortunately, he didn’t have a daughter or granddaughter of an appropriate age. Otherwise, Jingjing would have had another competitor.

Regardless of the different thoughts in their hearts, Su Nantian took Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing out of Yang’s house and refused the security guards sent by Yang Yuanyong.

Yang Yuanyong didn’t insist. After all, if anyone could harm those two girls, the security guards he sent would be completely useless.

After leaving Yang’s house, Su Nantian suddenly noticed an awkward situation.

This time he had come by taxi, and the two girls arrived by Lin Tianyi’s car.

So none of them had a car, and they had to take a taxi.

As he was about to hail one, suddenly a car horn sounded nearby.

Su Nantian looked over and saw a taxi parked there, with Wang Long sitting at the driver’s seat.

Chapter 90: Jade Ornaments

“Thanks!”

Su Nantian took Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing into the car, sitting in the passenger seat and said to Wang Long: “Hey boss, I saw you came by my car. Returning would be difficult.

People living here are either rich or noble, and they all have their own cars. Taxis rarely come this way, especially now that it’s late and hailing a taxi is difficult. I thought I’d wait for you.”

A small person with small wisdom, although Wang Long was just a taxi driver, Su Nantian saw his intelligence or carefulness.

From the government compound to Fengyue Residential Area, the road became more and more remote. After all, Fengyue Residential Area was the best environment in Fengcheng, so it wasn’t too close to the city center.

Following Su Nantian’s request, Wang Long drove fast. An ordinary taxi with strong acceleration felt more powerful than real sports cars.

But even so, Wang Long didn’t drive too fast—just over 200 km/h. After all, he always remembered that two ladies were on board.

Brave and careful, skilled and clever. This was Su Nantian’s evaluation of Wang Long. If there was an opportunity, he might help him.

After returning to Fengyue Villa, Su Nantian finally had the chance to take out three jade talismans from his storage ring and said to Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing: “These three jade talismans were specially made for you. You two and the little Taoist, each take one.

I carved a Golden Armor Array and a Nurturing Spirit Array on these jade talismans. The Golden Armor Array can automatically activate when in danger, at least blocking three bullets like the one today!

The Nurturing Spirit Array can automatically absorb spiritual energy from heaven and earth, curing illness and strengthening health. It’s especially good for skin care for girls and can help Jingjing suppress the cold spiritual energy in her body.

Now you two choose one that you like!”

When he said this, the three jade talismans floated up and approached Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing.

He hadn’t wanted to show these mysterious things in front of the two girls, but he was afraid that his enemies would become stronger and harm the second daughter.

Especially after Tang Sanqian’s incident, it had made Su Nantian feel a bit scared. If he hadn’t arrived in time, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

If something unexpected happened, even if he crushed those two beasts to dust and ashes, what could he do?

Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing didn’t pay attention to the jade talismans floating toward them. In their eyes, Su Nantian was omnipotent. One day, if he told them he was a god about to become immortal and ascend, they would believe it without doubt.

They only carefully examined the appearance of the jade talismans, as they didn’t fully trust a man’s taste.

The three jade talismans were called “jade ornaments,” but they weren’t entirely accurate. In fact, they resembled a longevity lock, a white jade bracelet, and a pendant like a wool sweater.

The two girls chose carefully. Lin Suyun took the white jade bracelet, and the rose-shaped wool sweater pendant was given to Gao Jingjing.

These jades were originally bought by Master Gao Qingyun at a high price from collectors. Naturally, they were rare and beautiful jades. Plus, Su Nantian had infused them with spiritual energy and carved arrays, so they naturally carried an immortal aura.

Even the one considered the ugliest by the two girls was not ordinary, with a mystical and ethereal aura.

After choosing, they left the longevity lock for the little Taoist. However, Lin Suyun blinked and asked Su Nantian: “Nantian, isn’t one missing?”

“Ah? There’s no shortage. You, Jingjing, and the little Taoist each have one, right?”

Lin Suyun’s words made Su Nantian stunned and explained.

“Why? There’s no Yáo Lìnà?”

Lin Suyun asked, and for some reason, her tone was strange.

“Ah… these are all prepared for our people. Of course, there’s none for her!”

“Ours?” Lin Suyun’s tone became even stranger. Her face showed a strange smile that made Su Nantian feel a bit weird.

“From what I know, she’s already one of us. How? Did you forget everything after eating?”

Su Nantian hadn’t expected Lin Suyun to say this. For a moment, even his face, which had been trained for 20,000 years, felt a bit hot...

“Um... how could that be…” Su Nantian was embarrassed and took out another jade ornament from his storage ring.

It was a ring, with a white jade hoop that naturally had a streak of red. Su Nantian skillfully refined it into a rose, as if it had grown there naturally.

If you looked closely, you could even see dewdrops on the rose petals.

Seeing Su Nantian take out such an exquisite ring, Lin Suyun’s smile became even more radiant. Su Nantian felt a chill down his back.

Fortunately, at this moment, his strong desire to survive kicked in.

He handed the ring to Lin Suyun and said, “If you hadn’t mentioned it, I would have forgotten to prepare one for her. But I only made four of them.

This ring was originally intended to propose to you, my wife. If I gave it to Yáo Lìnà, wouldn’t that be a pity?”

This ring was exquisite and one of a kind. It would be impossible to find another like it, even for Su Nantian.

After all, it wasn’t easy to find such a natural red streak in any situation.

Hearing Su Nantian’s words, Lin Suyun finally focused on the ring. In an instant, she was truly amazed by it.

“Big brother Tian, are you telling the truth?”

“Of course I am. Would I lie to you?” This earned Lin Suyun a white eye. She wasn’t stupid, and she wouldn’t be deceived by him.

She put the ring on her hand and didn’t plan to take it off. As for Yáo Lìnà… wouldn’t a white jade bracelet be perfect for her?

Su Nantian said it didn’t matter. Unfortunately, Yáo Lìnà hadn’t seen this scene.

As the saying goes, friendship between women is like plastic flowers that never wither.

Gao Jingjing watched Su Nantian and Lin Suyun’s playful interaction. Her face turned red, as if she was embarrassed but also full of envy.

This made Su Nantian laugh a bit. He waved his hand slightly, and the girl instantly rushed into his arms like a tired bird returning home.

Lin Suyun sighed slightly, feeling helpless but powerless. She moved aside a bit to give Gao Jingjing space.

Chapter 91: Six Blessings

The jade ornaments Su Nantian gave were very loved by the two girls. So, early in the morning they kept pestering Su Nantian to go buy jade and make ornaments.

Although refining jade and carving arrays was not an easy task for Su Nantian now, it wasn’t difficult if no arrays were needed. Just shaping them into ornaments was simple.

After being pestered all morning, Su Nantian reluctantly got out of bed with messy hair and brushed his teeth.

It was worth noting that the previous night, these two little ladies had slept in one room and pushed Su Nantian into the guest room.

This made his wish to study cultivation methods with Lin Suyun completely fail, and he got up in the morning full of resentment.

After breakfast at around 9 a.m., the three of them finally set out. Lin Suyun was driving, and Su Nantian still didn’t have a license.

Six Blessings was a famous jewelry store in Fengcheng and even throughout Jiangzhou.

Today, Su Nantian had brought Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing to buy jade. In the morning, there weren’t many people in the store.

As Su Nantian and the two girls entered, two sales assistants immediately approached them.

“Good morning, ladies. Sir, welcome to Six Blessings.

As a brand with hundreds of years of heritage, Six Blessings Jewelry is committed to meeting your needs. Whether it's gold and silver jewelry, pearls and diamonds, or jade and emeralds, Six Blessings has everything.

What would you like to see?”

While speaking, the sales assistant’s eyes fell on Su Nantian.

Firstly, his appearance was naturally attractive and drew women's attention. Secondly, after working in this industry for so long, they clearly knew who was the one making decisions and paying.

Su Nantian smiled slightly and said, “Miss, do you have jade materials for sale?”

The sales assistant’s face stiffened at Su Nantian’s question. It was unexpected.

Six Blessings didn’t sell jade materials. If they had good quality, they would use it themselves and wouldn’t sell to outsiders.

Seeing the sales assistant’s awkwardness, Su Nantian didn’t press her. He asked, “Go get your manager for me. I’ll talk to him. Say it’s a big deal!”

The sales assistant listened and went back to get the manager.

After waiting for a while, Su Nantian didn’t expect that the one who came was not just one person. In addition to the manager of this store, there was also an old man with white hair.

Clearly, the younger one in a business suit was the manager. He looked around thirty years old and appeared very professional and efficient, with a touch of a career woman.

However, Su Nantian didn’t like her. Her presence was too strong and made him uncomfortable.

“Hey, you want to buy uncarved jade materials?”

Before the manager spoke, the old man beside him spoke first. His tone wasn’t particularly kind but was quite gentle.

“Good sir, I want to buy some jade materials for carving.”

There was no need to deny it.

Hearing Su Nantian’s words, the old man examined his hands briefly and said nothing more.

The atmosphere seemed to become awkward. No one spoke, but this didn’t last long. The old man sighed and said to Su Nantian again:

“Hey, carving jade isn’t as simple as you imagine. Each piece of jade has its own soul and unique patterns.

Each piece of jade has thoughts and experiences of its own.

Six Blessings’ jade is all priceless, even the raw materials. So if you want to practice, find other materials instead.”
