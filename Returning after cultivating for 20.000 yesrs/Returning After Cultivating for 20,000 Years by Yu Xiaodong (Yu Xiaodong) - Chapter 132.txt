“ I said we are of the same kind. I have already discovered your true face. Besides me, there is no one else here. You need not continue to disguise yourself.”

Nan Gong Fei continued to fix Su Nantian with a piercing gaze, speaking in a coaxing tone as if this would extract the truth from him.

“Haha, I did not expect Master Table Brother to have such sharp eyes. My disguise is futile before you.”

Su Nantian quickly calculated several possibilities in his mind, finally letting out a light laugh and agreeing with Nan Gong Fei’s words.

Moreover, to match the expression he now wore, Su Nantian also displayed a sly smile.

After seeing this sinister expression, Nan Gong Fei’s eyes flashed with sudden certainty, and his gaze toward Su Nantian carried a touch of pride and surprise.

“After all, we are the same type. Naturally, I could sense your hidden nature.”

Nan Gong Fei said this while slowly curving his lips.

“Master Table Brother has uncovered my true identity. Are you planning to inform the Nan Gong clan head?”

Su Nantian continued questioning, his eyes never leaving Nan Gong Fei’s face. Moreover, Su Nantian truly demonstrated his ability to observe everything and hear every whisper, constantly monitoring Nan Gong Fei’s expressions.

“If I intended to tell my uncle about this, why would I have told you first?” Nan Gong Fei raised an eyebrow and spoke meaningfully: “Do you think I am as incompetent as the rumors claim?”

“How dare I underestimate Master Table Brother? Your strategies and intelligence are surely no less than the clan head’s.”

Su Nantian shook his head, dismissing Nan Gong Fei’s words.

Hearing this, Nan Gong Fei displayed a relatively satisfied smile, his gaze toward Su Nantian becoming gentler, as if he found Su Nantian increasingly endearing.

“Forgive my ignorance, Master Table Brother. I do not know what you wish me to do. Please enlighten me and stop making this simple-minded man guess.”

Su Nantian had already guessed Nan Gong Fei’s purpose in intercepting him, and he understood the reason for Nan Gong Fei’s sudden display of his true self. However, he would not voice it nor show it.

“Haha, surviving under my uncle and gaining the trust of my cousin Ping and Yuyan is no sign of stupidity.”

Nan Gong Fei chuckled again, continuing to gaze at Su Nantian with a meaningful look. After uttering this pointed remark, he added: “However, my purpose is simple—I wish to collaborate with you on a matter that has long been your expectation.”

He paused, then continued: “Of course, this task is neither difficult nor simple. Only you can facilitate it.”

“Please enlighten me, Master Table Brother.”

Su Nantian’s gaze darkened, his expression unchanged. When he spoke this sentence, he deliberately lowered his head to create an image of inferiority compared to Nan Gong Fei, aiming to make him lower his guard.

“Seems like you are willing to help me then?”

Hearing Su Nantian’s easy agreement, Nan Gong Fei displayed a brief expression of surprise, as if weighing the truth in Su Nantian’s words. His gaze also carried a touch of scrutiny.

Su Nantian naturally understood Nan Gong Fei’s concerns and said, “A good bird chooses its tree; a wise minister selects his lord. Master Table Brother’s intelligence and boldness far surpass that of Ping.”

Su Nantian directly praised Nan Gong Fei while deliberately belittling Nan Gong Ping, and he altered the way he addressed Nan Gong Ping to show his sincerity.

“Such an ordinary person as Ping would not have reached this position without a fortunate birth! It is truly you, Master Fei, who deserves this role and ability!”

Su Nantian said this while showering Nan Gong Fei with flattery.

Nan Gong Fei was delighted by Su Nantian’s praise, but he was not one to be easily swayed. He quickly suppressed his joy.

“You don’t need to flatter me so much. You must also demonstrate your abilities and show whether you are worthy of joining my faction.”

Nan Gong Fei spoke in a condescending tone, as if he had no doubt about Su Nantian’s intentions.

“Of course! I will never let Master Fei suffer losses.”

Su Nantian displayed an obedient expression, stepping forward a pace toward Nan Gong Fei.

After this action, Su Nantian lowered his voice, speaking in a tone only they could hear: “Actually, the clan head has recently shown signs of wanting to retire. Moreover, I have observed that he intends to pass the position to Ping.”

Su Nantian paused here, and upon seeing Nan Gong Fei’s face instantly turn fierce, he continued: “However, I believe Ping is unworthy of the position. If he becomes clan head, the Nan Gong family’s prestige may never recover.”

“My uncle is truly a fool.”

Nan Gong Fei spoke this with clenched teeth.

Su Nantian said nothing, continuing his previous words: “I also think so! In my eyes, Master Fei is the most capable!”

After saying this, Su Nantian feigned an accidental slip: “I have been waiting for Master Fei to recruit me all along. Once you become clan head, I could also be the next chief steward. How prestigious that would be! No longer just a hired bodyguard under others’ command!”

Su Nantian’s half-serious complaints seemed genuinely dissatisfied with his current status.

The more Su Nantian expressed his discontent toward Nan Gong Lin and others, the more he understood Nan Gong Fei’s mindset.

Indeed, Nan Gong Fei could not help but smile.

“Hmph, your ambitions are quite bold.”

Nan Gong Fei glanced at Su Nantian again before adding, “But your judgment is quite good.”

Nan Gong Fei was certain he had not misjudged him. After saying this, he gave Su Nantian another meaningful glance.

Chapter 661: Reaching an Agreement

“Indeed! Scanning the horizon, who else but Master Fei has the ability to lead the Nan Gong clan? One cannot expect Nan Gong Yuyan, a delicate and helpless lady, to manage the family. That would be laughable!”

Su Nantian displayed a sycophantic expression, climbing on the bandwagon with sincerity. His words were genuine and devoid of pretense, making them more convincing. Nan Gong Fei thus displayed a more satisfied expression.

“Fine! As long as you help me secure the position of clan head, the chief steward’s role will be yours.”

Nan Gong Fei clearly agreed with Su Nantian’s words, his gaze toward him now carrying admiration and gradually dispelling his doubts.

He was already overwhelmed by Su Nantian’s honeyed words and had convinced himself that Nan Gong Ping was a fool, while Nan Gong Yuyan, though clever, was a woman and thus fundamentally lost. She was not worth fearing.

Nan Gong Fei even felt he had already become the next clan head, his expression more proud and self-assured. He longed to immediately claim the coveted throne he had awaited for so long.

Su Nantian, seeing Nan Gong Fei entranced by his honeyed words, again praised him with a few more compliments, increasing the sugar.

Meanwhile, Su Nantian inwardly shook his head in disdain.

It seemed all members of the Nan Gong clan were prone to a hereditary flaw—arrogance and self-satisfaction.

It was unfortunate they had forgotten that overconfident soldiers are doomed to defeat, and that arrogance ultimately leads to failure.

No wonder the Nan Gong clan, renowned for over a century, was now in decline. Based on the current generation of Nan Gong’s descendants, it seemed they would inevitably fall into oblivion.

“Enough. We’ve wasted enough time. If we don’t return soon, Ping will suspect something. Let’s go.”

Nan Gong Fei suppressed his joy and waved his hand, beginning to act like a master before Su Nantian. After saying this, he added a warning: “Remember, after returning, keep things as usual. Do not reveal any clues.”

After this warning, Nan Gong Fei still felt it was insufficient. After pondering, he told Su Nantian: “Also, when I do not contact you, you must not seek me out recklessly. Naturally, if there is a major discovery, that’s another matter. This cannot be delayed. Remember?”

“Understood, Master Fei. I will be cautious and careful, never exposing myself or disrupting your ascension to clan head.”

Su Nantian inwardly mocked, but outwardly showed no sign of it. He respectfully agreed to Nan Gong Fei’s words.

Hearing this, Nan Gong Fei nodded in satisfaction. He gave Su Nantian a meaningful glance before leading the way, insisting on being first in even such simple matters. He truly demonstrated his arrogance to the fullest.

Su Nantian did not confront Nan Gong Fei or rudely interrupt his reverie.

Su Nantian said nothing, following the rules and staying behind Nan Gong Fei, while his mind drifted to other matters.

“Back?”

When they returned to the private room, Nan Gong Ping said nothing but greeted him with a simple word. He then invited Nan Gong Fei to sit and continue their discussions.

As for Su Nantian, he naturally returned to his original position, diligently fulfilling his duty.

“Haha, Old Lin is indeed fortunate to have so many clever descendants. Unlike me, I am alone and without anyone to rely on.”

Their main discussion had already concluded, now entering the final stage. Naturally, it was a series of polite exchanges and mutual flattery.

Indeed, Wu Chuan began his performance again, lavishly praising the Nan Gong clan members.

“Haha, Master Wu, you are too kind. Your family head is young and capable, with your support, how could we compare? You are simply too modest.”

Nan Gong Ping took Wu Chuan’s words and reciprocated, having exchanged several interactions with him. Naturally, he imitated Wu Chuan’s manner of flattery, returning it in kind so that neither side gained an advantage.

When it came to compliments, both sides were equally skilled, having exhausted all possible praises. They took turns like actors in a play, exchanging compliments for several rounds before finally ceasing.

Wu Chuan smiled and bid Nan Gong Ping farewell, appearing reluctant. Nan Gong Ping also imitated this, displaying deep affection as if they were old friends.

“Hearing a single word from you is worth ten years of reading,” Nan Gong Ping said, still polite: “Master Wu, please invite me often. I could never tire of chatting with you!”

“Of course! Without lying, I too felt an immediate connection with your nephew. I wish to chat for three days and nights!”

Wu Chuan also smiled and replied, their farewells almost three steps back. They only stopped when they each got into their cars.

Watching their performances, even if they did not feel tired, Su Nantian felt exhausted.

Thinking about this, he envied his current role as a bodyguard. Otherwise, he would have to engage in the same back-and-forth flattery with Nan Gong Ping. He feared he would have died of frustration.

“Hmph! That old fox!”

After getting into the car, Nan Gong Ping suppressed his smile and frowned, muttering a curse.

“Master Ping? What’s wrong?”

Hearing Nan Gong Ping’s words, Nan Gong Fei immediately played the role of a caring younger brother, showing concern for Nan Gong Ping.

But in truth, his concern was feigned; his real intention was to gather information.

“What else could it be? I had promised my father to quickly reach an agreement with this old fox. Unfortunately, this old man is surface-friendly but secretly shrewd and cunning. He only gives verbal promises without any real action, always evading when it comes to signing the contract!”

Like their previous meeting, it had wasted an entire morning. In reality, they had spoken a lot of empty words with no real value!

Thinking about this, Nan Gong Ping’s expression darkened further.

“Ah? So that’s how it is? I thought Master Wu was quite approachable!”

Nan Gong Fei feigned confusion, appearing innocent and naive.

“Alas, my younger brother is simple-minded and cannot understand the intricacies of this.”

Nan Gong Ping sighed, speaking.

Chapter 662: Struggles and Rivalries

“Never mind, you don’t understand these things. Why bother telling you? It’s just making you suffer.”

Nan Gong Ping, filled with frustration and no one to vent on, sighed again before speaking this sentence.

This was his true thought, based on his usual impressions of Nan Gong Fei. It was indeed no fault of his.

But this sentence sounded unappealing to Nan Gong Fei’s ears.

After all, his feigned weakness was a pretense, but when others said it, it felt like an established fact. Naturally, Nan Gong Fei felt uncomfortable.

Moreover, Nan Gong Ping’s words not only suggested he was simple-minded but also prevented him from probing further. Thus, Nan Gong Fei felt even more reluctant.

However, this was not the time for Nan Gong Fei to turn things around. He could not show his feelings too obviously, so he remained reluctant and silent, giving Su Nantian a meaningful glance to signal him to find an opportunity to gather information from Nan Gong Ping.

After all, Su Nantian had already gained Nan Gong Ping’s trust; it was relatively easy to extract some information compared to others.

Su Nantian received Nan Gong Fei’s meaningful glance and did not pretend not to see it. He nodded slightly when Nan Gong Ping was not paying attention, indicating his agreement.

With Su Nantian’s approval, perhaps he had found another channel to gather information. Nan Gong Fei’s expression returned to normal, no longer trying to probe further.

Meanwhile, Wu Chuan and Li Assistant in another car were discussing the events that had just occurred in the private room.

“Master, I think Nan Gong Lin’s luck has run out. Neither him nor his son or that foolish nephew need to be feared.”

Li Assistant spoke first, his words and tone filled with disdain for the Nan Gong family.

His attitude also carried a contempt for the Nan Gong clan, as he truly looked down on them.

This was his genuine opinion; thus, sometimes he could not understand why Wu Chuan spent so much time playing along with Nan Gong Ping. He could have easily tricked Nan Gong Ping with a few tricks.

Even if Wu Chuan had greater ambitions, he could have taken the opportunity to dismantle the Nan Gong clan’s power and seize their interests. This cooperation was a perfect chance!

“Haha, Ahmu, after being by my side for so long, how could you make such a big mistake?”

Wu Chuan heard Li Assistant’s words and his gaze deepened. His lips curved slightly, and his smile became more reserved. Though his tone remained consistently polite, Li Assistant, who knew Wu Chuan well, could sense that his tone was off.

Moreover, the content of Wu Chuan’s words was a clear reprimand!

Hearing this, Li Assistant immediately lowered his head and apologized with trembling reverence: “It was my foolishness. I acted too hastily without understanding the situation. Master’s teachings are correct.”

“Enough, you don’t need to be overly cautious.”

Seeing this, Wu Chuan’s expression softened slightly. His gaze toward Li Assistant also carried a touch of warmth, but the curve of his lips remained unchanged.

“I merely remind you that I brought you by my side because of your meticulousness and caution. However, recently, you have become too superficial and no longer think deeply.”

Wu Chuan continued speaking. This was also a warning to Li Assistant, urging him to be more alert.

“What do you mean, Master?”

Li Assistant had long been by Wu Chuan’s side and had earned his position through solid abilities. Now, he was becoming lazy in thinking, which aligned with Wu Chuan’s words. After being reminded, Li Assistant immediately thought deeply about the previous events and noticed a clue.

Li Assistant widened his eyes in surprise, speaking with suspicion: “Nan Gong Fei is not someone who would easily back down.”

“Haha, the Nan Gong clan has no one who is easygoing.”

Wu Chuan heard Li Assistant’s guess and his lips finally curved. His gaze toward Li Assistant also returned to its usual gentleness. This test, Li Assistant had passed temporarily.

“Unbelievable! I never thought Nan Gong Fei would have such ambitions. However, with Nan Gong Lin having two children, whether male or female, it would not fall to a mere nephew like Nan Gong Fei!”

Li Assistant sighed in disbelief, mocking both Nan Gong Fei’s feigned ignorance and his foolish dream.

“Although that is true, how can you know who will win without trying? The clan head position is not fixed.”

Wu Chuan disagreed with Li Assistant’s words. His tone was profound, and after saying this, Li Assistant immediately showed a look of realization.

After all, Wu Chuan was not the sole legitimate heir of the Wu clan. Yet he had climbed to this position through his own efforts.

Although it seemed that Wu You’er was in charge, the real power lay with Wu Chuan. No matter what decision was made, it was his word alone that decided everything. What role did Wu You’er play?

“Master, do you approve of Nan Gong Fei?”

After thinking for a while, Li Assistant cautiously asked.

With Wu Chuan’s precedent, it was not entirely impossible for a nephew to become the clan head of the Nan Gong family.

Moreover, Nan Gong Ping’s abilities were mediocre. If Nan Gong Fei had been playing the fool all along, concealing his brilliance, and now with Wu Chuan’s support, he might even achieve his dream.

Thinking about this, Li Assistant’s gaze toward Wu Chuan became more intense, as if trying to guess whether his thoughts were correct or not.

“Haha, I don’t trust any of the three Nan Gong children.”

Unexpectedly, Wu Chuan gave an answer that surprised Li Assistant. He let out a light laugh and spoke seriously, with no trace of humor.

“One is overly clever but lacks wisdom; the other is willing to endure but not patient.”

Wu Chuan spoke slowly, analyzing this. This referred to Nan Gong Ping and Nan Gong Fei.

“But there is also Nan Gong Yuyan, who is both wise and brave.”

Li Assistant asked his question, as Nan Gong Yuyan had been praised by Wu Chuan himself. She was a talent after all.

“Yes.”

Wu Chuan nodded, but quickly changed his tone: “But she is a woman. If there were truly significant matters, it was uncertain whether she could be relied upon. From my understanding, Nan Gong Lin is quite stubborn.”

Otherwise, it would have been Nan Gong Yuyan who came to discuss the wetland bidding plan instead of Nan Gong Ping.

Chapter 663: Divergent Thoughts

“Hmph! He really is wise for a fool. I can’t help but mock him for his foolishness!”

Wu Chuan did not hide his satisfaction. After saying this, his smile expanded further.

Perhaps Nan Gong Lin was indeed old and no longer as sharp-minded.

Thinking of this guess, Wu Chuan’s mood became even better. He disliked it when others praised Nan Gong Lin for supporting the vast Nan Gong clan alone and elevating it to greater heights since becoming clan head.

But what was the use of Nan Gong Lin’s talent? His age had caught up with him, and his peak was about to be reached. And it seemed he had absorbed the intelligence of the next three generations, leaving his descendants without strength or potential.

According to this logic, Nan Gong Lin had elevated the clan but would only bring more sighs when it declined.

“Hahahaha! Nan Gong Lin, I see how you’ll fight me! You have these two children; I will play with them slowly and watch as they die under my hands!”

Wu Chuan thought this in his heart, unable to help but gritting his teeth and speaking it out.

Li Assistant stood by, hearing Wu Chuan’s teeth-gritting thoughts clearly. At this point, he understood Wu Chuan’s intention.

What he meant was simple: the Nan Gong clan’s descendants were all incapable of shouldering responsibility and could not support the vast Nan Gong clan.

But if that was true, why did Wu Chuan waste so much time playing with them? Why did he care so much and pay such attention to them?

“Then why, Master…”

Thinking of this, Li Assistant could not help but ask his question. He especially did not understand why Wu Chuan had specifically pointed out the hidden intentions of Nan Gong Fei.

Li Assistant had initially thought Wu Chuan wanted to follow his old path, elevating Nan Gong Fei and using this method to control the Nan Gong clan.

Then, when the Nan Gong clan and Wu family were both under Wu Chuan’s control, it would not be difficult for them to dominate the entire inland port. No one would dare oppose Wu Chuan.

“Haha, this is very simple.”

Wu Chuan did not need to wait for Li Assistant to finish his sentence before guessing what he was about to ask. He decided to answer Li Assistant’s question, speaking slowly with a clear tone of mockery and laughter.

Wu Chuan’s tone and manner clearly showed he had no respect for the Nan Gong clan.

He let out a low laugh and continued: “I just want to stir up the water. As for who will be the stick to stir it, I have no interest in that.”

After saying this, Wu Chuan felt even more at ease. His smile grew wider.

“Tell me, who will benefit when the Nan Gong clan falls into chaos?”

Wu Chuan continued speaking, asking Li Assistant softly.

“Of course, it’s Master!”

Li Assistant immediately answered Wu Chuan loudly, his face filled with excitement.

The more the Nan Gong clan fell into chaos, the better it was for Wu Chuan and his family. Thinking about this, Li Assistant could not help but feel elated.

He even longed to jump into the water himself, stirring it up so they could continue swimming in murky waters.

“Master has such far-sightedness! I admire you!”

Li Assistant’s eyes lit up, showing a look of realization. He was both surprised and enlightened. Then he gave Wu Chuan a thumbs-up, praising him without hesitation and looking at Wu Chuan with admiration.

No wonder Wu Chuan had defeated so many candidates for clan head and successfully seized control of the Wu family.

Indeed!

If the Nan Gong clan’s internal conflicts began, and then the wetland bidding started again, they would be in both internal and external crises.

At that time, even if Nan Gong Lin was clever with three heads and six arms, he would be overwhelmed and unable to focus on others!

As for them, they would sit back and watch the tigers fight, quietly enjoying this play. Then, at the necessary moment, they would strike when the opportunity arose and finish off the fallen!

Li Assistant thought more and more excitedly, his expression gradually approaching madness. He now longed for that day to come quickly so they could enjoy this happy time!

“Then, Master, what should we do with Su Nantian?”

After his excitement, Li Assistant quickly suppressed his thoughts and calmed himself. He continued asking Wu Chuan.

As he asked, Li Assistant also displayed a puzzled expression, as if he did not understand why Wu Chuan valued Su Nantian so much.

“Master, I think he has no great talent. His appetite is just too big. I have already offered three million, but he still showed no reaction, as if he was not moved at all.”

As the saying goes, people die for wealth and birds for food. Li Assistant did not believe that Su Nantian, a mere bodyguard, would show no interest in three million.

Perhaps Su Nantian was just pretending to hide his true intentions, aiming for greater gains through a feigned retreat.

After this guess, Li Assistant’s opinion of Su Nantian became even more contemptuous. He felt Wu Chuan had wasted too much time on someone who was not worth it.

“Not moved?”

Wu Chuan raised an eyebrow upon hearing this, but his expression was thick with interest. Li Assistant’s words had caught his attention.

Li Assistant, seeing Wu Chuan’s expression was a bit puzzled, but he still spoke honestly and continued answering Wu Chuan.

“Yes, Su Nantian showed no signs of being moved at all. I thought he was hiding well and kept watching him closely, not missing any expression on his face. But he still showed no signs of being moved.”

After saying this, Li Assistant also displayed a confident expression, trying to convince Wu Chuan of this fact.

However, Li Assistant was still puzzled. He could not help but secretly guess whether Wu Chuan had overthought it, and perhaps Su Nantian was just lucky to gain the Nan Gong clan’s favor.

In fact, Su Nantian did not deserve their effort at all.

Thinking about this, Li Assistant raised his head and his expression became more serious, even beginning to worry about Wu Chuan.

“Haha.”

Li Assistant had expected Wu Chuan to agree or acknowledge his words, but instead, Wu Chuan only let out a light laugh. His face even showed an expression of admiration.

“He should not have been moved.”

Wu Chuan continued speaking, and this statement was like a thunderclap in winter, far beyond Li Assistant’s expectations.

Li Assistant swallowed his saliva and displayed a look of complete confusion, intending to question Wu Chuan. However, Wu Chuan seemed to understand Li Assistant’s thoughts and slowly explained.

Chapter 664: Inciting Trouble

“Ahmu, think carefully.”

Wu Chuan spoke leisurely, his tone calm and unhurried: “If Su Nantian had truly been moved by just three million, I would have to reconsider whether my assessment was wrong and overestimated his value.”

He paused before adding a self-satisfied smile: “From the current situation, I have not made a mistake!”

After saying this, Wu Chuan smiled even wider and felt much better.

Li Assistant, hearing Wu Chuan’s words, still did not fully understand but his expression carried a touch of confusion. However, he was not foolish enough to ask directly. Instead, he patiently waited for Wu Chuan’s next words.

Indeed, after a brief pause, Wu Chuan continued with a smile, his mood clearly much better: “Su Nantian’s demands grow more and more; the bigger his mouth, the more筹码 he has. We should be happy, not worry about him refusing.”

“But…”

Li Assistant heard Wu Chuan’s words and felt they made sense, but he still had some confusion: “If this kid is just playing tricks, what will Master do?”

They could not allow themselves to suffer a loss like this!

“Haha, what should I do?”

Wu Chuan seemed to have heard a joke. He let out a cold laugh and then displayed an evil expression, continuing: “If he dares to mock me, I will make him spit out everything he has!”

At this point, Wu Chuan paused for a moment before continuing: “Hmph, let him never be able to eat anything again in his life!”

As for what Wu Chuan meant by “eating,” it was obviously not food but benefits and advantages.

Hearing Wu Chuan say this, Li Assistant finally felt relieved. He knew Wu Chuan would never be so hasty or trust someone blindly.

Indeed, Wu Chuan was still the same as before, with several preparations in place!

Thinking about this, Li Assistant quickly asked Wu Chuan: “Then Master, should I contact Su Nantian now and urge him to respond quickly?”

Being able to cooperate with the Wu family was a blessing from his past life. There was no way this kid could hesitate or refuse!

“Don’t, don’t be so hasty.”

Who knew Wu Chuan interrupted Li Assistant’s actions and did not plan to urge him.

Then, Wu Chuan continued speaking slowly with a relaxed tone: “The bait needs to be scattered gradually. If we catch him too quickly, it would lose the fun of fishing.”

After all, Wu Chuan had plenty of patience. He wanted to watch the Nan Gong clan, which had prospered for generations, gradually fall into ruin!

As for Su Nantian who suddenly appeared, he had not been too concerned. In Wu Chuan’s view, Su Nantian was merely a small appetizer before his main course or an insignificant dessert.

There was no need for him to worry so much.

“Yes, Master! Master truly has foresight; unlike me, I am short-sighted.”

Li Assistant respectfully replied. Since Wu Chuan had made his decision, Li Assistant would not say anything to ruin Wu Chuan’s mood.

On the contrary, Li Assistant was quite perceptive and remained silent without further questioning.

“Alright, you go prepare. We still have more interesting games to get ready.”

Wu Chuan had spoken enough and no longer felt like continuing the conversation with Li Assistant. He gave a few instructions before sending Li Assistant out.

At this moment, the wooden door of the meeting room was suddenly pushed open forcefully.

“Something is wrong! Master!”

The person who ran in was a servant of the Wu family. His expression was anxious, as if something terrible had happened. His tone was filled with tension and urgency, making people’s hearts jump in worry.

“Shouting! You have no training! How dare you disturb the Master so anxiously!”

After regaining his composure, Li Assistant scolded the servant. He was very dissatisfied with him.

The servant had already been extremely nervous, and after being scolded by Li Assistant, he was even more frightened. His limbs went limp, and his face turned pale without color.

“Ahmu.”

Wu Chuan called out to Li Assistant softly, his expression returning to its usual calmness.

Then, Wu Chuan turned to the servant and spoke gently with a soothing tone: “Come on, don’t kneel. Stand up and explain the situation clearly.”

After saying this, Wu Chuan smiled again: “I’m not a fierce beast. There’s no need to fear.”

“Yes, Master.”

The servant trembled as he stood up but his legs were still weak and lacked strength.

Although Wu Chuan was now particularly kind and gentle, the servant who had come to report still looked like a mouse seeing a cat. He could not help but tremble and fear.

“Master, the family head suddenly refuses to eat anything. Moreover, she insists on wanting to see you. She said that if she doesn’t see you, she will never eat a single bite.”

The servant took a deep breath and spoke with courage. After saying this, he immediately lowered his head again, as the action made him miss Wu Chuan’s fleeting look of cruelty.

They had already advised her for a long time, but she would not eat or drink anything. They could do nothing but report to Wu Chuan.

After all, in the eyes of these servants, the most powerful person in the Wu family was not the family head, Wu You’er, but Wu Chuan, who led from behind.

That was why these servants always felt like mice seeing a cat whenever they saw Wu Chuan, only trembling and fearing.

“Not eating?”

Li Assistant understood Wu Chuan’s thoughts immediately. He looked at him and then asked for him: “When did it start?”

“Yes! Li Assistant, the family head hasn’t eaten anything since last night.”

Facing Li Assistant, the servant was still afraid but not as nervous as when facing Wu Chuan. His speech was no longer stammering.

“What! Since last night? Then why did you only report now!”

Li Assistant’s voice immediately rose. It was already evening now, and it had been almost a day!

If something happened then, would there be no chance to save her?

Chapter 665: Death as a Threat

“Li Assistant, it’s not that we didn’t say. The family head did not allow us to speak. At first, we thought she was just not hungry and didn’t pay attention. But this morning when the family head still refused to drink a single drop of water, we immediately advised her!”

The servant thought it was bad and sighed inwardly. Now he felt like a pincushion, caught between both sides with no place to turn.

“Little one, I slipped out secretly to tell the Master!”
