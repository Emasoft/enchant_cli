No matter what, these people had provoked themselves. And Su Nantian had already made up his mind that as long as they came, he would ensure they never dared to return.
Therefore, dealing with them was a matter of duty for Su Nantian.
It must be said that these bullies had now stepped on Su Nantian’s soft spot; they had successfully angered him.
Thinking of this, Su Nantian’s expression darkened, and his aura changed again.
At that moment, Uncle Wang stood up: “No, I’ll go with you.”
These were people he was familiar with, having lived among them for so many years. How could Uncle Wang stay at home while the villagers bore the bullies’ wrath?
Moreover, in the end, Su Nantian was the one he had saved. Even if there were blame to be laid, he could not escape responsibility. Since it was Su Nantian who had brought this trouble, Uncle Wang would never abandon him.
Upon hearing this, Su Nantian was momentarily stunned. But seeing the expression on Uncle Wang’s face, he knew he would not change his mind.
Thus, Su Nantian could only nod in agreement.
It was at this moment that Su Nantian finally understood why everyone in the small fishing village held Uncle Wang in such high regard.
Indeed, it was because of his daily habits and courage to take responsibility.
Su Nantian gave Xiaowang a brief warning, telling him not to go out easily. Soon after, he and the young man who had come to inform him rushed over.
When they arrived, they found the villagers who had resisted the bullies already beaten senseless.
At that moment, all the villagers lay on the ground, clutching their bellies and groaning in pain. None could get up.
Upon seeing this, Su Nantian’s anger burned completely and would not easily fade.
He would never forgive these bullies!
“Hao, Hao Ge! It’s him! He’s here!”
The bullies had been beating the villagers to vent their anger. Their moods were already quite good, and they were having fun at the time.
But none of them had expected to suddenly see Su Nantian appear.
They were as startled as if they had seen a ghost in broad daylight.
Especially one of the bullies, who had been terrified by Su Nantian before, now saw him and immediately jumped up. When he called out to Hao, his speech was stammering.
“Hao Ge! What should we do now? He really showed up!”
The bully continued to speak anxiously. From his voice and expression, it was clear he was genuinely worried and afraid—no pretense at all.
“Stay calm! He came out, so we’re here to find trouble with him! Why are you so flustered? Don’t disgrace us!”
Losing face was not an option. Seeing Su Nantian was like a mouse seeing a cat—how could that be allowed?
They would have already lost before they even started.
Hearing his friend’s nervousness, Hao immediately frowned and scolded him: “Besides, we’ve brought enough people. How can we be afraid of just one Su Nantian? Stand up straight, or what kind of image do you want to show?”
Hao glared at the bully with a look of disappointment, then gave him a hard slap on the shoulder to encourage him.
The other bullies, hearing Hao’s words, felt a sense of relief and gradually relaxed. They were no longer as tense as before.
They had indeed reacted instinctively, and seeing Su Nantian was like encountering a natural enemy. It wasn’t an exaggeration—they were as scared of him as mice seeing a cat, almost ready to run away with their tails between their legs.
But now that Hao had said this, and seeing the dozens of strong henchmen behind them, the bullies gradually calmed down. They were no longer as flustered.
After all, they had so many people; how could they be afraid of one Su Nantian?
Chapter 785: Underestimating
The man who had called out to Hao was also very nervous. After hearing Hao’s reassuring words, he felt that what Hao said made sense.
“Yes, Hao Ge, you’re right. We can’t lose face!”
This time they had come back to reclaim the dignity Su Nantian had stolen. It was no use coming all this way only to be scared when they saw him.
This time, he would make these henchmen thoroughly beat Su Nantian.
Beat him hard so that he would never be afraid again.
“Is it you, the defeated?”
At this moment, Su Nantian stepped forward. He slightly restrained his expression, but seeing the villagers lying on the ground in agony, and those familiar faces, his fists slowly clenched.
If anyone who knew Su Nantian noticed this action now, they would realize it was a sign of his anger before he even spoke.
“Unexpectedly, you still dared to return? I underestimated you.”
After saying this, Su Nantian paused for a moment before continuing: “Did you forget my warning? Or was the lesson I gave you not enough?”
As he said the latter half, his voice dropped sharply. His aura and presence changed completely.
His eyes were even more piercing, as if he could instantly turn into a blade of sight and slice these bullies into pieces.
But at this moment, Su Nantian didn’t know why, his head suddenly ached. He instinctively raised his hand to touch his temple and furrowed his brows.
What was this?
Why did this scene feel so familiar, as if he had once encountered a group of people who had dared to provoke him and harmed those he cared about?
But Su Nantian couldn’t remember who they were. He only had a vague memory, and he struggled to recall it, but his head hurt more, as if about to explode.
“Are you okay?”
At this moment, Uncle Wang rushed over to support Su Nantian. Seeing him clutching his head, he guessed that he was having the same problem again.
When Uncle Wang had saved Su Nantian, he had noticed that Su Nantian’s head had been hit before. But after it healed, no one paid much attention.
And Su Nantian had only recently started experiencing headaches.
So when Uncle Wang saw Su Nantian’s action, he knew it was a recurrence of his illness. He rushed over to support him and asked anxiously.
“I’m fine, Uncle Wang.”
Su Nantian held onto Uncle Wang’s arm for support and shook his head, pushing away those inappropriate thoughts.
Indeed, after not delving deeper into the memories, Su Nantian’s head no longer hurt as much. The sharp pain had disappeared.
His complexion also improved significantly.
The bullies saw Su Nantian’s change and sneered at him.
“What? Yesterday, you were so arrogant, but today when we brought people, you started to be afraid and even had a headache?”
The bullies spoke arrogantly. They directly insulted Su Nantian: “How about this? If you now kneel before me, beg for mercy, and say a few words that you’re a fool, a despicable person who dared to provoke me, I’ll let go of these useless villagers. How about that? This deal should be acceptable.”
A Hao spoke arrogantly, mocking Su Nantian. In fact, even if Su Nantian did as they said, they would never let go of these innocent villagers.
After all, this time A Hao and his group had come with full intention to thoroughly beat Su Nantian.
Then they would flatten the entire small fishing village, ensuring that those villagers who had resisted them would suffer.
“Ah Li, don’t!”
“Wang the Physician, don’t listen to these bullies! They’re devils without humanity!”
“Ah!”
The villagers greatly respected Su Nantian. Especially after he had often helped them, treated their illnesses, and taught them to identify many herbs to improve their lives, they respected him even more.
So now, hearing these bullies provoke Su Nantian with words and ask him to do such a degrading act, they naturally couldn’t accept it.
Unfortunately, the villagers failed to persuade Su Nantian and instead caused the bullies’ annoyance. They gave a single glance, ordering their henchmen to attack the villagers and thoroughly beat them.
“Bullies? Devils! So you scum call us that in front of our faces? That’s really disrespectful!”
A Hao, although he had heard about it before, couldn’t tolerate being called that in person. So his anger was immediately ignited. He directly ordered the henchmen.
These henchmen worked for money, so they obeyed their orders without question. Upon hearing A Hao’s command, they immediately attacked and showed no mercy, immediately swinging steel batons at the villagers.
The villagers cried out in pain and could no longer curse A Hao’s group.
“Hahaha! That’s right! These scum! They really don’t know when to die!”
A Hao, seeing them beaten, laughed heartily and mocked them again. He had no mercy at all.
“Hao Ge has the way! Beating these villagers should be done like this!”
The other bullies also laughed heartily in agreement. They had no idea they were now playing with death.
“Stop.”
At this moment, Su Nantian could no longer忍耐. His eyes were already red with anger.
Su Nantian had lived in the small fishing village for many days, always calm and polite. He was very courteous to the villagers and had never shown anger or even redness in his face.
Today’s anger was far beyond what the villagers could imagine.
Su Nantian gave his command, but even though he tried to restrain himself, his voice still revealed his anger.
“What? You told me to stop?”
At this moment, A Hao laughed arrogantly, thinking he had caught Su Nantian’s weakness. He laughed and asked his friend: “Did you hear what he said? Does he have a hole in his head?”
At this point, he still dared to order him to stop.
He would never give Su Nantian a good face or calm down even if he knelt and begged for mercy.
Su Nantian had dared to offend him, so he should bear the consequences of his anger.
Moreover, A Hao had thought clearly this time—that was to thoroughly beat Su Nantian and grind him into the ground. He would not give him a chance to escape.
Chapter 786: Joy Turns to Sorrow
“Thinking about what? He’s crazy!”
“Yes, yes. Who does he think he is to give us orders?”
The other bullies also echoed, all looking at Su Nantian with mockery. They had no idea they were now on the edge of death.
“I said, let them stop.”
Su Nantian did not erupt but continued to suppress his voice.
This time, his voice was cold and heavy, making people feel their hearts tremble.
A Hao had wanted to continue mocking Su Nantian, but for some reason, when he met Su Nantian’s eating eyes, he was intimidated. His heart felt icy cold, as if someone had poured a bucket of ice water over his head in the dead of winter. He was completely chilled.
Soon after he regained his senses, he realized he had been intimidated again by Su Nantian and lost face. His anger flared up even more, burning fiercely.
“Fight! Keep fighting! Hit them hard!”
A Hao again ordered the henchmen. At this moment, his face was full of cruelty and looked almost like he wanted to eat people.
He asked them to stop? And dared to use such a commanding tone?
Then he should let Su Nantian know the consequences of offending him.
Moreover, A Hao was thinking that now he had brought so many people here and there were so many villagers. How many could Su Nantian protect?
A Hao wanted to put Su Nantian in a state of self-blame and let him suffer endlessly, making his heart endure countless torments!
Just thinking of this made A Hao feel much better.
“Hao Ge, you don’t want to provoke me?”
Seeing that A Hao did not obey his command and instead ordered the henchmen to hit harder, Su Nantian didn’t get angry but smiled. However, the aura he radiated made people immediately break out in goosebumps and their hair stood on end.
“Hao Ge, this is not right,” one of the bullies said with concern, looking at A Hao carefully. How did he feel that the air around him had changed and become thinner?
In fact, A Hao also felt these strange feelings. It was a feeling he had never experienced in his twenty years of life. But A Hao felt it was losing face to show weakness before Su Nantian.
So even though this feeling surrounded his whole body, A Hao still tried to stand straight and shouted at Su Nantian: “What? You want to scare me? I was raised by fear!”
“Then hope your courage is big enough.”
Su Nantian’s lips slightly curled, saying this with a meaningful tone. Then, without knowing what he did, the next moment was all the sound of heavy objects falling to the ground.
“Peng, peng—”
“Ah?”
Then came the startled cries of these henchmen. They all looked at the ground in confusion.
Yes, they didn’t know what had happened, but suddenly their steel batons felt like they weighed a thousand catties and far exceeded their strength.
So all of them dropped the batons on the ground.
“Who told you to drop the batons?”
A Hao furrowed his brows, looking at this scene in confusion. Then he angrily scolded the henchmen.
After saying that, A Hao immediately commanded: “What are you still standing there for? Pick up your batons and keep hitting! I didn’t tell you to stop!”
A Hao angrily announced, then glared at Su Nantian again as if that could scare him.
But Su Nantian’s expression had not changed at all, and even his eyes did not look at A Hao. He completely ignored the provocation.
“Yes, Hao Ge!”
The henchmen immediately answered Hao’s call. In fact, they themselves were also confused and didn’t know what had happened.
They just felt their hands suddenly loosened, so the batons fell to the ground.
Now hearing A Hao’s command, they reacted and quickly bent down to pick up the batons.
But at this moment, another strange event happened.
No matter how hard they tried to lift the batons, they felt that the batons were completely stuck on the ground. Or perhaps this weight far exceeded their ability to bear. No matter how hard they tried, they couldn’t lift the batons again.
And many of the henchmen used all their strength, but they turned red in the face. The batons still remained firmly on the ground without moving an inch, as if another pair of hands were holding them tightly on the ground.
“Are you doing what? Did I not say it?”
A Hao saw these henchmen hadn’t picked up the batons for so long and again scolded them angrily.
After saying this, he immediately urged: “Hurry up! Didn’t you hear what I said? Pick them up! Thoroughly beat these insolent villagers!”
After saying this, A Hao continued to glare at Su Nantian, as if doing so would let Su Nantian know his strength.
“Hao Ge! You really misunderstood us! We never had this intention at all! And we dare not!”
The henchmen heard A Hao’s words and felt extremely委屈. They also felt like they were eating yellow连 (a Chinese idiom meaning to eat something bitter without being able to say anything).
Who didn’t know A Hao’s reputation in this area? They had just wanted to make some money and show off before A Hao, so they could have better opportunities later.
But who knew that things were going well and then suddenly had problems?
“Not really, Hao Ge. We do this for money, we take the job and eliminate problems for others. That’s our principle. But we really couldn’t pick them up, it has nothing to do with us!”
The henchmen now were also anxious. They spoke in a confused manner, fearing that A Hao would misunderstand them.
And now the henchmen were also anxious, worried that something strange had happened.
A Hao heard their confused words and felt his ears were about to explode. He was now angry and scolded: “Bullshit, I don’t believe you can’t pick them up!”
At this point, A Hao also felt another thought. He was wondering if these people were trying to raise the price and pull tricks, otherwise why couldn’t they pick them up?
Was it really haunted by ghosts!
After thinking of this, A Hao’s face became even more ugly. He felt he had to give these people a lesson so they would know their place.
A Hao’s eyes narrowed, his gaze had become extremely dangerous and he was ready to give these people a lesson.

“Hao Ge, you really misunderstood us! We never had this intention at all! And we dare not!”

Chapter 789: A Lesson
In fact, Su Nantian was thinking of giving these people a lesson they would never forget, ensuring that as long as they lived, they would remember not to provoke the people of the small fishing village.
“You and them, split into two groups, and take turns beating each other.”
Su Nantian didn’t waste time but directly commanded them.
After saying this, he pointed to the steel batons on the ground: “Beat them as you beat the villagers. Don’t let me know you’re slacking or holding back.”
Su Nantian spoke coldly, continuing his command. His eyes were like ice, and one glance could freeze the opponent.
This method of Su Nantian’s was simple: to return their own methods against them. They had beaten the villagers, so now they would suffer the same fate.
“Ah? This…?”
The henchmen and bullies immediately froze, looking at Su Nantian in surprise.
They hadn’t expected Su Nantian to come up with this idea.
To beat each other with steel batons? Just thinking about it hurt.
“Don’t know how to act?”
Su Nantian raised an eyebrow and sneered. Then he cruelly continued: “Or do you want me to do it myself?”
With A Hao’s precedent, Su Nantian believed these people wouldn’t be foolish enough to make him do it himself.
Indeed, this last sentence was like a spell that frightened them all. They immediately split into two groups and picked up the batons, beating each other as Su Nantian had ordered.
“Ah!”
“Ouch!”
The sound of the batons hitting skin was quite obvious, and their cries of pain echoed constantly.
In this quiet mountain area, it was a unique melody.
And this scene was rare to witness.
Many villagers laughed heartily, finding it extremely satisfying to see these bullies and henchmen fight each other.
After all, these people had done the same to them.
The villagers didn’t have a saintly heart and wouldn’t show compassion for their enemies.
