"Even if he doesn't listen to me, I won't mind taking down Old Hong."

Old Hong had already witnessed Su Nantian's prowess, so he knew the man's previous words weren't mere boasting but a genuine assertion of his ability.

Thus, Old Hong dared not utter a word, merely nodding in submission. His hopes had all been pinned on Qiya, but he hadn't expected the man to be such a failure—unable to protect himself or offer any assistance.

Yet now, with Su Nantian holding him in check, he dared not resist, forced to comply and lead Su Nantian to the Xu family.

At this moment, Old Hong could only place his hopes on the Xu household. He prayed that once there, Su Nantian would shift his focus and direct all attention toward the Xu family. Then he could seize the chaos to escape, distancing himself from this entanglement. Old Hong had a well-laid plan, calculating how to slip away amidst the confusion.

He was unaware that Su Nantian had already penetrated his thoughts. Su Nantian merely feigned ignorance, deliberately remaining silent.

Otherwise, how could he have missed such an obvious intention from Old Hong?

Throughout the journey, Old Hong seemed to accept his fate, no longer attempting to flee on the road but instead behaving obediently and respectfully guiding Su Nantian toward the Xu household.

Seeing Old Hong's cooperation, Su Nantian's expression softened slightly, his gaze no longer so impatient.

"Old Hong?"

The gatekeepers of the Xu family, upon spotting Old Hong, were taken aback.

Old Hong was no small fry in their district, and due to his improper relationship with Xu Xiangning, the family had at least a passing familiarity with him.

Thus, when they saw Old Hong and Su Nantian walking together, they were surprised.

"Old Hong, it's so late—what business do you have?" the gatekeeper asked politely, considering his connection to Xu Xiangning. He was courteous but would not let Old Hong in without prior arrangement or an introduction.

At this point, it was only out of respect for Xu Xiangning that they treated Old Hong with courtesy. Otherwise, he would have been ejected immediately.

Chapter 864: To the Xu Household

Old Hong was unaware of their inner thoughts; otherwise, he would have been furious.

Seeing them greet him politely, he felt satisfied, as if regaining some dignity.

"I need to speak with Old Lady Xu. Please inform her."

Old Hong coughed lightly and addressed the gatekeeper.

He considered himself worthy of such courtesy toward these guards.

He assumed that after saying this, he would be invited in and treated with respect.

But fate had other plans. Instead of being ushered inside, the guards scrutinized him suspiciously, as if he were a criminal. They even guarded against him like a thief.

"Old Lady Xu?"

The gatekeeper had assumed Old Hong was coming to see Xu Xiangning. He was surprised when the man claimed he wanted to meet Old Lady Xu instead.

He blinked again, watching Old Hong with curiosity before speaking. Though his tone was respectful, it carried an unmistakable undercurrent of disdain.

"And what is your business with Old Lady Xu?"

Old Hong, upon hearing the question, furrowed his brow. He hadn't realized they had misunderstood him and repeated himself, though his expression was now less patient.

"Old Lady Xu is likely asleep by now. It would be better to come tomorrow, regardless of the urgency."

When it came to Old Lady Xu, the guards were no longer as accommodating. They scrutinized Old Hong carefully, sensing his visit was not for good intentions. To avoid responsibility, they dismissed him politely.

"Old Hong, this is our rule. We hope you won't make things difficult for us."

The guard added another sentence, which was polite but carried an implicit warning. It was clear they did not wish for Old Hong to persist further.

Otherwise, he would be seen as meddling unnecessarily.

"Ah! Do you not know my identity?"

Rules? What a joke!

Old Hong's brow furrowed, his gaze dark with anger. He hadn't expected his status to be disregarded by these guards. Especially considering he had already been powerless against Su Nantian, now being mocked by a gatekeeper—this was unbearable.

More than that, he felt his dignity wounded in front of Su Nantian.

Of course, Old Hong feared that Su Nantian would deem him useless—unable to even enter the gate—and thus decide to eliminate him.

It was this fear that prompted his reaction.

"Truly outrageous! I've come to visit Old Lady Xu with sincerity—how dare you, a lowly servant, give me orders? If you know your place, do your job properly! Hurry and inform her!"

Old Hong's voice rose in anger. After saying this, he added: "If you delay my business, I'll make sure you regret it!"

Old Hong now threatened the guards. He believed his words had been clear enough; if they still failed to act, it would be a disgrace. His face and dignity would be lost before Su Nantian.

But the guards deliberately defied him, whether out of spite or misunderstanding his hints.

"Old Hong, you're joking! In the entire city of M, who doesn't know your reputation? But Old Hong, you understand we must follow the rules. Without Old Lady Xu's permission, we dare not let anyone in."

The guard spoke kindly but made it clear they would not allow him entry.

"If there's urgent business, perhaps come tomorrow."

The guards were unafraid of Old Hong. Considering the risk of angering Old Lady Xu by informing on him, they had no intention of helping.

They even feigned concern for Old Hong's sake, urging him to reconsider. But their true meaning was clear: he should not expect entry.

"Ah! You!"

Old Hong's face darkened, surprised by their audacity. He only now realized the importance of status and power. He understood that even within these great families, a gatekeeper looked down on them.

Without striving for superiority, one could only be despised and discarded.

Otherwise, he wouldn't have needed to flatter Xu Xiangning, that capricious middle-aged woman.

Why not pursue younger, more attractive women?

But considering he still needed to bring Su Nantian in, Old Hong wanted to demonstrate his value before him, proving he still had some use.

Thus, he tried to argue with the guards, attempting to convince them of his worth.

At this moment, Su Nantian reached out and grabbed Old Hong's arm, cutting him off.

"I can do it. Give me another chance!"

Old Hong was taken aback, his body trembling with cold fear. He worried Su Nantian had grown tired of him and was cutting him off to end their exchange.

The more he thought this, the more anxious and fearful he became, dreading Su Nantian would kill him.

But Su Nantian only interrupted his words, offering no additional glance.

Then Su Nantian let out a cold laugh and waved his hand, subduing the guard before they could react.

"Hey! What—what—"

The sudden turn of events startled the guard, who didn't understand Su Nantian's technique. "What are you doing?"

Chapter 865: Direct Entry

The guard had been focused on Old Hong, placing their attention entirely on him. They had assumed Su Nantian was just a young man with no significance.

But now, Su Nantian had subdued them instantly, causing the guard to gasp in shock.

"You... you..."

Old Hong also looked at Su Nantian nervously, unsure of what this formidable figure would do next—kill him or do something else.

Su Nantian, upon hearing this, only cast a cold glance at Old Hong. Old Hong immediately understood and fell silent, no longer speaking or making any inappropriate noises.

Then Su Nantian grabbed Old Hong by the collar and led him in, walking calmly without haste.

He had merely wanted to test the Xu family's strength and capabilities. That was why he had remained silent, observing how Old Hong would handle the situation.

Now it seemed even a gatekeeper was so arrogant; the people inside must be far more imposing.

After this realization, Su Nantian wasted no time and stepped in directly.

Thinking about how he would soon uncover his true identity, Su Nantian felt a surge of excitement.

The guard watched Su Nantian walk in with Old Hong, first stunned before regaining their composure. They quickly shouted after them:

"Hey! What are you doing? Come back! Get back here!"

The guard was furious, not expecting Su Nantian to be bolder than Old Hong. He hadn't said a word, yet had walked in directly.

He hurriedly tried to stop them, but seeing they ignored him and continued without pause, he became desperate and rushed forward.

But before long, the guard realized a terrifying problem:

He felt as if an invisible barrier blocked his path. No matter how hard he pushed, he was stopped in place and could not move forward.

Thus, the guard could only watch helplessly as Su Nantian led Old Hong in calmly.

He forcefully collided with the invisible wall several times, but it was all in vain—useless and ineffective.

Then the guard remembered to use his walkie-talkie to inform the security inside: "All positions, be alert! A dangerous person has entered with Old Hong. Their target is Old Lady Xu. Everyone must be on high alert and prevent them from approaching the old lady!"

The guard quickly reported, urging those inside to be cautious. If anything happened to Old Lady Xu, they would surely face consequences.

This invisible barrier had allowed Su Nantian to enter, but those inside could not let him go unchecked.

Otherwise, they would truly face dire consequences and wouldn't know what to do!

Thinking this through, the guard was like a ant on a hot pan, extremely anxious.

He continued to angrily collide with the invisible wall, but it still blocked him. He only felt his muscles aching from the effort and could not move forward.

The more he did this, the more he felt Su Nantian was extremely dangerous. He quickly grabbed his walkie-talkie again, instructing the colleagues inside to be on high alert when facing Su Nantian.

He also told them that upon seeing Su Nantian, they should kill him immediately and prevent the dangerous person from approaching Old Lady Xu.

"Quick! Someone has entered! Everyone hurry!"

At this moment, the security personnel inside had already heard the guard's report. They were now anxious and relayed the message, preparing all positions and drawing their weapons in readiness for battle.

But they had not yet experienced Su Nantian's strength, nor had they directly confronted him like the guard.

They thought it was just a foolhardy person entering, so they became excited.

Especially since these security personnel had always guarded the Xu family, and due to the family's reputation in M City, no one dared to provoke them.

This was the first time someone had entered, and for these security personnel, it was a fresh experience—more excitement than fear.

However, they quickly relayed the news to Old Lady Xu and others without delay.

Upon hearing this news, Old Lady Xu and the family reacted similarly to the security personnel—they did not fear the person at all.

They thought this person had come to their doom.

They did not take it seriously, and Xu Hai and others stood by Old Lady Xu's side. They watched the monitor together as Su Nantian and Old Hong walked in step by step.

They watched the monitor's image, their smiles becoming more brazen.

Only Xu Wen, the second son who was handling affairs for Old Lady Xu and had not yet returned, could not face this situation directly. The rest of the family was gathered here.

"Mother, what should we do? Should I send someone to kill them?"

Xu Hai stepped forward and asked Old Lady Xu after watching Su Nantian and Old Hong approach.

He had long known Old Hong was untrustworthy, but he hadn't expected him to dare bring someone in to attack their family.

Old Hong was unaware that the Xu family had already considered him an accomplice, as he had brought Su Nantian in. If Old Hong heard their conversation now, he would surely cry out his innocence and be utterly crushed.

"Leave it for now. Let's see how close they can get."

Old Lady Xu let out a cold laugh, watching the monitor with amusement.

She watched the image as if it were an entertaining play because Su Nantian had now revealed his true face, and the Xu family hadn't recognized him.

They also didn't know this person was the one who had harmed their grandson outside.

Old Lady Xu still treated it as a game, deeply interested in it.

Moreover, the entire Xu family did not take this matter seriously; they all thought Old Hong's ambitions were obvious, and that he had been scheming against them all along.

"He has become quite arrogant."

Old Lady Xu said this, offering a contemptuous comment.

Chapter 866: Foolishness in the Dark

But they found it strange that only two people had entered. If they truly wanted to attack the Xu family, they should have brought more subordinates to surround them.

Why had they come with just two people? Was it because they were foolish or overly confident, thinking that the two of them could take down the entire Xu family?

The Xu family had stood for years in M City not just because of Old Lady Xu's iron will but also due to the various skilled individuals they had recruited.

These people were well-trained and formidable; ordinary people could not match them.

Moreover, their abilities were comparable to special forces—ordinary people couldn't even withstand a few moves. Hence, everyone feared the Xu family and dared not challenge them recklessly.

However, seeing Old Hong and this young man enter directly, Old Lady Xu and the family decided not to use their secret weapons yet.

They would let the security personnel play with them first and assess their capabilities.

But at this moment, Old Lady Xu and the family thought that Old Hong and this young man were too arrogant. When they realized their mistake, it would be too late to seize the opportunity against Su Nantian.

"Mother, I heard that Old Hong had brought people into our Xu family. Is it true? Is this really happening?"

Xu Xiangning rushed in at that moment, her face full of anxiety. She didn't understand what had happened.

She had been applying a mask, enjoying her beauty routine, and was happy about having instructed Old Hong to handle this matter. Everything had been fine so far.

But she didn't know how, but she heard a commotion outside and had to go out to ask the servants. She then learned about this significant event.

She immediately tore off her mask and hurriedly put on her coat, rushing over.

The thought of Old Hong daring to oppose their Xu family made her feel shocked.

"What was he thinking? Why would he dare to break into our Xu family at night? Is he really that foolish?"

Xu Xiangning spoke angrily, thinking about Old Hong's actions. She couldn't understand what he was thinking!

And Xu Xiangning also thought Old Hong had been kicked by a donkey, otherwise why would he be so clueless and do this?

"they have already passed through the central hall. If you want to know why, just ask him yourself."

Old Lady Xu frowned, clearly disapproving of Xu Xiangning's hasty behavior.

She looked at the face that resembled her own in youth but felt it lacked half the aura and composure. She found it headache-inducing.

If not for Xu Xiangning being the only daughter of their generation and her resemblance to Old Lady Xu in youth, she would not have indulged her so recklessly.

But now, seeing Xu Xiangning still acting haphazardly after all these events, lacking any family grace, especially with her age, she hadn't cultivated any elegance.

She was always hasty and impulsive, like a wild chicken, showing no grace of the Xu family at all.

Thinking about this, Old Lady Xu also mused that after dealing with this matter, she might have to change her previous decision and send Xu Xiangning away. She could no longer indulge her in front of herself.

Otherwise, seeing Xu Xiangning around constantly would shorten her life by half.

Xu Xiangning was unaware that this hasty action had caused a shift in her mother's heart. She didn't know she had already lost her status and would no longer enjoy the current glory.

But it didn't matter, as Old Lady Xu could no longer carry out her inner thoughts now. They had already offended Su Nantian, and there would be no future days.

"Mother, why did Old Hong suddenly oppose us? Why would he do this?"

Xu Xiangning was still unaware of her mother's changed feelings. She furrowed her brow and asked again, confused.

But after hearing her mother's reprimand, she somewhat restrained herself.

Still, the more she thought about it, the more puzzled she became. She hadn't noticed any signs when she was with Old Hong.

Old Hong had not probed anything about their Xu family from her, and this alone made her feel strange. Her mind was confused and puzzled about why Old Hong had done this.

Xu Xiangning felt more and more confused in her heart, unable to understand why Old Hong would suddenly oppose their Xu family.

"Mother already said it. If you want to know why Old Hong did this, just ask him yourself."

Xu Hai stepped forward impatiently. He had tolerated his sister for a long time, and now seeing her made him think of the embarrassing things she had done to their Xu family.

They had become a disgrace and the only stain in their family's development so far.

Moreover, Xu Hai was different from Xu Xiangning, who was single-minded. He had already sensed Old Lady Xu's change and knew her attitude toward Xu Xiangning was shifting.

Thus, his tone toward Xu Xiangning was no longer as friendly and polite as before.

It must be said that among the Xu family members, except for the single-minded Xu Xiangning, everyone was quite intelligent.

"I'm just curious and asking mother, what did you say? I didn't ask you!"

Xu Xiangning was unaware of her lowered status in her mother's heart. Hearing Xu Hai dare to mock her, she gave him a disapproving look and retorted.

"You...!"

Xu Hai was furious, feeling utterly bewildered. He now understood why Old Lady Xu had changed her attitude toward Xu Xiangning.

Otherwise, having such a person around would drive him mad!

After thinking this through, Xu Hai didn't waste words on Xu Xiangning. He thought it was pointless to argue with a fool.

After all, there's a saying: Don't argue with fools.

If that was the case, why bother talking so much to Xu Xiangning?

She wouldn't understand his meaning anyway.

"Hey!"

Xu Xiangning was ready to argue with Xu Hai but stopped abruptly, confused.

"Enough! Be quiet."

Old Lady Xu spoke softly and warned them again.

Chapter 867: Arrogance in the Dark

"Stop talking."

Old Lady Xu spoke again, her expression serious.

"Yes, Mother."

Xu Hai nodded in agreement, and although Xu Xiangning was不满, she dared not act out due to Old Lady Xu's expression.

She could only grumble silently and say nothing.

Old Lady Xu, seeing they had stopped arguing, was satisfied and turned her gaze back to the monitor. She wanted to watch what Su Nantian and Old Hong would do next.

After that, all the Xu family members remained silent, watching the monitor's image. With Old Lady Xu's warning, the Xu siblings dared not speak anymore and became like statues.

Meanwhile, the security personnel followed the video's content, stationed at the next location Su Nantian and Old Hong would reach. They planned to intercept them first and then capture them all at once.

In the time they spoke, Su Nantian had already led Old Hong through the central hall.

The Xu family was one of the top families in M City, and their residence's area was naturally vast. This entire region belonged to Old Lady Xu, making them effectively rulers of their domain.

No wonder the family was so arrogant and looked down on ordinary people, with no fear at all.

Su Nantian asked Old Hong directly: "Where are the Xu family's people? Take me there."

He gave a command and had Old Hong lead the way. Now that he was at the Xu family, Su Nantian didn't want to waste time.

The area was too large, and he was a first-time visitor. To find the Xu family's people, he needed Old Hong's help.

This was why Su Nantian temporarily spared Old Hong's life. He wouldn't be as foolish as Old Hong and the others thought, bringing in that upright Qiya.

If he had brought Qiya, there would have been no peace along the way. Considering Qiya's single-mindedness, Su Nantian believed he would have constantly caused trouble and wanted to deal with him.

Although Su Nantian wasn't afraid of his actions, it was unnecessary.

He didn't want to provoke this trouble along the way.

Old Hong, hearing Su Nantian's command, dared not delay and immediately responded: "Yes, yes. Follow me."

After witnessing Su Nantian's strength, Old Hong was no longer as arrogant as he had been at first. He now addressed Su Nantian with complete respect.

He watched Su Nantian carefully, fearing one misstep would anger him.

"Yes."

Su Nantian nodded in satisfaction at Old Hong's obedient behavior and told him: "Lead the way."

Once he found the Xu family's people, Su Nantian would reveal all his questions.

After clarifying his lost memories and discovering who he truly was, Su Nantian would promise to return to the fishing village, protect its people from harm for life.

On the other hand, the villagers of the fishing village had been worried about Su Nantian since he left. They constantly feared for his safety and worried he might encounter danger.

Especially Wang Shu, who had taken care of Su Nantian the most, and Xiao Wang. They were constantly anxious, watching the village entrance every day, hoping to see Su Nantian walk in at any moment.

Especially Xiao Wang, who no longer played with other children in the village. He sat on a small chair at the village entrance every day, ready to welcome Su Nantian's return.

Unfortunately, Xiao Wang waited for a long time without seeing the person he wanted to see. But he refused to give up, spending most of his time at the village entrance except when Wang Shu called him back for meals. He had become like a stone monument watching for his uncle.

They hadn't agreed with Su Nantian's hasty departure at first, but he had insisted. Moreover, he had truly lost his memories. Wang Shu and the others couldn't selfishly keep him back.

They also thought Su Nantian was right—since those people outside had been searching for him, one day they would find the fishing village again and disrupt their peaceful life.

If that happened, even if the villagers didn't blame Su Nantian, he would feel guilty.

So Wang Shu and the others chose to let Su Nantian go, not clinging to him but allowing him to search for his memories.

They now only prayed silently that Su Nantian would be safe and return soon.

Otherwise, they wouldn't know how worried they'd be about him.

At this moment, Su Nantian was unaware he had become the villagers' concern. He let Old Hong lead him step by step toward the Xu family's people.

But just then, many security personnel in uniform rushed in from the entrance and blocked Su Nantian and Old Hong's path.

"Stop! I order you both to drop to the ground, hands on your heads, and don't speak!"

The head security officer shouted at Su Nantian and Old Hong, ordering them to crouch down without any movement.

He instructed Su Nantian and Old Hong while the other security personnel all pointed their guns at them.

Their eyes remained fixed on them without deviation, as if any movement from Su Nantian and Old Hong would result in immediate gunfire.

"Trouble! It's the Xu family's security personnel!"

Old Hong whispered fearfully to Su Nantian, saying: "You should have let me bring my guards. They could have held out for a while."

Old Hong knew the Xu family was one of M City's top families. Their security personnel were selected and different from ordinary people.

But his men had fought alongside him in the underbelly, climbing to power through blood and sweat.

Thus, Old Hong thought if they had come along, they might have held out for a while and allowed Su Nantian to find the Xu family's people quickly.

"Haha."

Su Nantian only let out a light laugh, completely disregarding the situation. "No need."

Bringing those people would only be a burden, and Su Nantian didn't need external help. These people looked intimidating but surrounded them densely, leaving no escape route.

The security personnel also relied on their weapons to act arrogantly.

Chapter 868: Rushing Forward

But to Su Nantian, these people were merely clowns and not worth worrying about.

"Be quiet! You heard me, don't speak again. If you don't crouch down, we'll take action!"

The security officer, seeing so many guns aimed at Su Nantian and Old Hong, dared not move further. His voice carried a threat, warning them not to act recklessly.

Old Hong was now very anxious. He wanted to comply with the security officer's instructions but hesitated, watching Su Nantian.

If Su Nantian didn't do this, he would be seen as weak and go against Su Nantian's wishes. He didn't know if that would anger the man.

"Yes?"

Compared to Old Hong's anxiety, Su Nantian was much calmer. He didn't regard these security personnel as a problem and hadn't expected them to block his path.

He spoke softly, watching the security personnel with a playful gaze.

And Su Nantian truly had no fear of these security officers, not feigning it but with genuine confidence.

"You!"

The security officer was exasperated, having never seen such an arrogant person before.

But no one had dared to provoke the Xu family, so they hadn't encountered such a situation before.

But now that Su Nantian was so arrogant, the security officer wanted to teach him a lesson. He ordered his men to aim at Su Nantian's legs and fire a warning shot, not killing him.

The security chief had planned well and wanted to intimidate others with this move.

But he hadn't expected that when he fired, Su Nantian didn't even dodge, and his eyes didn't blink.

He thought the bullet would pierce Su Nantian's leg, but instead, it stopped abruptly in front of Su Nantian as if blocked by an external force.

"Ah—!"

The other security personnel behind him all gasped in shock, stunned by the scene before them.

They hadn't expected the bullet to stop so suddenly in front of them, and each stared wide-eyed, unable to accept this scene.

"How is this possible?"

Even the security chief who had fired the shot hadn't expected such a scene. This was an impossible ability, exceeding human limits!

His eyes were wide, as if they would pop out of his sockets.

Thinking about this, he showed a terrified expression.

"Is this what you call being unkind to me?"

Su Nantian smiled, as if he had seen their fear and unease. But he felt no pity, only a cold laugh before raising his hand. The bullet flew back toward its original direction.

"Ah!"

The security chief screamed instinctively upon seeing the bullet flying toward him, unable to control his fear.

But the bullet stopped right in front of his forehead without moving forward.

This action didn't relieve the security chief but made him even more terrified, and his legs gave out, causing him to sit on the ground.

He couldn't imagine what would happen if the bullet's control was slightly weaker, and Su Nantian hadn't stopped it. Then his head would have been pierced!

The security chief thought about this and looked at Su Nantian with terror, not expecting Su Nantian to have such a move.

Su Nantian's casual action terrified them all, and it seemed extremely frightening.

It appeared that Su Nantian could control every bullet with just a finger movement, penetrating them all.

This was why the security chief felt Su Nantian could remain so calm; he could kill all the security personnel in an instant with just one move.

It was this confidence that allowed Su Nantian to remain calm and fearless!

"Mother, this..."

Not only did the security officers facing Su Nantian show fear, but even Xu Hai in the monitoring room showed a surprised expression.
