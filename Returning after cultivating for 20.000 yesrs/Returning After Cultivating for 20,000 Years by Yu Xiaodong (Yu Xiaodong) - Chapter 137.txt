Su Nantian truly felt his head was splitting in two. He had never realized Nan Gong Ping was so gossipy and fond of jokes.

And yet, when he made fun of him, it was utterly undignified.

Su Nantian felt himself on the verge of despair; he was utterly exasperated.

"Ah! You don’t need to hide from me anymore, I already know what you’re thinking!"

Nan Gong Ping had not been swayed by Su Nantian’s words, instead believing that Su Nantian was simply too embarrassed to admit it. Nan Gong Ping gave him a reproachful glance, then patted his chest and vowed loudly: "Alright! Don’t worry anymore!"

"Master? What are you saying?"

Su Nantian felt he was losing touch with Nan Gong Ping’s logic. He had no idea what his meaning was.

But soon, Su Nantian would understand, for Nan Gong Ping had already patted his chest and vowed again: "I told you before, as long as you follow me closely, I will never take advantage of you! Not only will I let you marry Wu You’er with honor, but even other beauties of unparalleled charm will be at your disposal—countless!"

Of course, this was under the condition that Su Nantian remained loyal to him.

After Nan Gong Ping made this vow, he didn’t wait for Su Nantian to speak but immediately thought of the mistress he had kept outside. He recalled that the gift box he had prepared for her was now used as an excuse, and so Nan Gong Ping immediately began to ponder what gift he should give his mistress.

"Brother? Su Nantian? What are you two doing here?"

As they spoke, Nan Gong Yuyan suddenly appeared. She curiously observed Nan Gong Ping and Su Nantian, then said: "Why did I hear you talking about a little beauty? Brother, have you taken another mistress again?"

"Impossible!"

Nan Gong Ping immediately denied it with a guilty voice. Then he added, trying to cover up: "We were discussing important matters. What beauties or not? Do you think I have time for that?"

After saying this, Nan Gong Ping looked at Nan Gong Yuyan with a determined gaze, as if his words were absolute truth.

But how well did Nan Gong Yuyan know Nan Gong Ping?

Upon hearing his tone and seeing his expression, she immediately realized something was wrong. She narrowed her eyes, scrutinizing Nan Gong Ping with disdain: "Brother, you don’t need to use some so-called important matters to fool me. I know what you’re up to! You must be going to see your mistress!"

As she said this, her eyes remained sharp like a blade, and she noticed a flicker of nervousness in his gaze. She immediately exclaimed angrily:

"Brother! Why are you doing this again? Have you forgotten what Father said? He hates it when you chase after women! If he found out, he would be furious! You must not go!"

"Ah! My dear sister! If you don’t say it, and I don’t say it, how would Father find out?"

Nan Gong Ping inwardly cursed his luck and immediately flashed a fawning smile, trying to persuade Nan Gong Yuyan: "You don’t think about it—brother is already this old, how can I live like a monk? Please be lenient and don’t tell Father!"

After saying this, he added: "If Father doesn’t know, he won’t be angry. You’ve recently taken an interest in a real estate development, right? I’ll give it to you as a gift!"

"Brother!"

Nan Gong Yuyan was furious when she realized Nan Gong Ping had been caught in his secret and now tried to bribe her. She shouted angrily, glaring at him with a look of disappointment: "I won’t collude with you! You can forget about me keeping it a secret!"

Nan Gong Yuyan’s attitude was extremely firm, as if she would immediately inform Nan Gong Lin the moment Nan Gong Ping went out.

Nan Gong Ping was not a man with a good temper, especially since he was the eldest son of the Nan Gong family. From childhood, he had been the center of attention, always carefully tended to by others.

He had already used immense patience to speak softly to Nan Gong Yuyan, but now that she was unyielding and meddling in his private affairs, he immediately became angry.

"Nan Gong Yuyan, you are only my sister! Not my mother! When will you stop meddling in my affairs? Also, don’t always give me orders!"

Nan Gong Ping growled angrily and then glared at Nan Gong Yuyan before sweeping his sleeve and leaving.

"Nan Gong Ping!"

Nan Gong Yuyan hadn’t expected him to leave so abruptly, and she was even more furious when he had insulted her. She stamped her foot angrily and shouted after his back: "If it weren’t for Father, who would care about you! Do you think you’re something special!"

After venting her anger, she continued to rant: "Who wants to meddle in your private affairs! It’s only because Father cares! I’m not saying you can’t find women in the future! Just settle down with one girlfriend and stop chasing after all these messy people! Did I do anything wrong!"

Chapter 686: Innocent Fish Caught in the Crossfire

"Brother, you don’t have to be so stubborn!"

After saying this, Nan Gong Yuyan continued to grumble angrily: "Dogs bite Lu Dongbin and don’t recognize good intentions!"

Nan Gong Yuyan muttered to herself, clearly becoming more and more angry. If Nan Gong Ping were still there, she might have argued with him for three hundred rounds.

"Madam, your brother is an adult; he can make his own decisions. You shouldn’t worry so much."

Su Nantian was stunned, as he had no intention of getting involved in their sibling quarrel. But fate had made him unlucky, appearing at that exact moment, so he couldn’t help but step in.

"You both were just arguing over nothing; it’s pointless and only causes siblings to grow apart, right?"

Su Nantian felt like a neighborhood committee member. He was always mediating between father and son or between siblings, with no rewards for doing so.

Nan Gong Yuyan was in a rage, and Su Nantian became her target. As soon as he spoke, she found an outlet for her anger.

"What does that have to do with you? Are you also on your brother’s side!"

Nan Gong Yuyan first glared at Su Nantian angrily, dragging him into the conflict.

"You men are all no good! All of you are scoundrels!"

Then Nan Gong Yuyan began to curse angrily, pushing Su Nantian roughly and walking away with long strides. Her back was full of anger, as if she were about to burst into flames.

"What the hell? What does that have to do with me?"

Su Nantian was stunned, his mouth wide open. He felt utterly exasperated, especially watching Nan Gong Yuyan’s angry back. He felt completely helpless.

This incident had nothing to do with him at all, right?
Why did Nan Gong Yuyan act as if he had angered her!

Su Nantian felt completely wronged.

At this moment, Su Nantian finally understood what it meant to be an innocent fish caught in the crossfire!
Because he was that innocent fish!

Su Nantian thought about this and shook his head helplessly. He felt particularly innocent today, first being teased by his brother without reason and then becoming the target of his sister’s anger.

"Never mind, I must have owed you two in my past life!"

Su Nantian sighed helplessly again, then said: "Anyway, I came here with other purposes. Today’s events are just repaying you!"

Soon after, Su Nantian composed himself and began to think about what Lü Li had told him that day. As soon as he thought of Wu You’er suffering from severe anorexia and being worried about her parents, his heart was filled with worry.

"Ah, I wonder if Wu You’er can survive until we find her parents!"

Thinking of this, Su Nantian sighed softly and then suddenly remembered something. He immediately left the spot quickly.

Su Nantian returned to his private room in the Nan Gong family.

At first, he was just a common bodyguard; within the Nan Gong family, bodyguards were as numerous as mice and no one paid attention to them. It was only after Su Nantian seized an opportunity and gained Nan Gong Lin’s favor that he had achieved his current esteemed position, even possessing a private room.

Only this alone was enough to make the servants and staff in the Nan Gong family envious of Su Nantian. They secretly regarded him as their role model, each imagining if they could one day reach Su Nantian’s position and gain the favor of their superiors.

But now was not the time to talk about this. After returning to his private room, Su Nantian did not let his guard down; he carefully checked the surroundings to ensure there were no spies or surveillance devices. Only then did he proceed with his next action.

Su Nantian approached the potted plants and lifted them, revealing a plastic-bagged phone inside. He then took out the phone and reinserted the card before turning it on.

The phone had barely turned on when a call came in immediately.

Su Nantian curled his lips, as if seeing an old friend. Without hesitation, he answered: "Hello."

"Big Brother Tian! You finally turned on your phone! You don’t know how long we’ve been monitoring it! We were waiting for you to come online!"

The other party was clearly very familiar with Su Nantian. Upon hearing his voice, he immediately greeted him happily. Naturally, he didn’t forget the main issue and quickly got to the point after exchanging greetings: "How about it, Big Brother Tian? Do you have any findings to report?"

"Ah, this time is bad news."

Su Nantian nodded in affirmation and his mood became heavy. Especially thinking of Wu You’er suffering somewhere unknown, he felt immense worry.

"Wu You’er has a severe case of anorexia and is currently being held captive by Wu Chuan. I went to the Wu family today, but couldn’t find her location."

This phone was issued by his superiors during a special mission. Each phone had an identification number and a tracking device, used for communication and protection of the task executors.

Su Nantian had executed various tasks, but rarely used this phone. Therefore, his use of the phone to contact them now was enough to prove that he had encountered a difficult situation.

"What? Anorexia?"

Upon hearing Su Nantian’s report, the other party was immediately shocked. He hadn’t expected this situation to arise: "Wu Chuan has also imprisoned her? That’s really despicable!"

Everything Wu Chuan did was under their watch, and nothing had been overlooked. It was no wonder this staff member despised Wu Chuan so much.

"Yes."

Su Nantian nodded in agreement, then added earnestly: "But now is not the time to criticize Wu Chuan. We need to find Wu You’er quickly. Do you have any findings on your side?"

After saying this, Su Nantian thought of another thing and immediately asked: "Also, have you found any news about Wu You’er’s parents? Her illness this time was probably due to them."

"Big Brother Tian, our people are also trying their best to investigate. But you know Wu Chuan is so despicable and careful, he never leaves any evidence for us."

The other party also looked troubled, unsure of what to do.

Chapter 687: At a Loss

"I’m sorry, Big Brother Tian, our logistics are too useless to help at all! That’s why you’re in such a difficult situation now!"

The other party suddenly felt guilty, as if he had thought of something. He seemed to feel deeply sorry for Su Nantian: "You’ve worked so hard outside, and you successfully infiltrated the Nan Gong family. This difficult task has already been completed, but we still couldn’t help at all and only dragged you down."

"Da Zhang!"

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian immediately frowned and stopped the other party from continuing his self-reproach. Then he loudly called out his name, his voice serious and authoritative.

"Here!"

Upon hearing Su Nantian’s tone, Da Zhang immediately responded loudly. Even though he was on the phone and Su Nantian couldn’t see his posture, Da Zhang stood up immediately and straightened his legs, standing at attention. This startled everyone in the room.

"Don’t let these thoughts appear again, okay? You must get rid of them immediately, understood?"

Su Nantian spoke seriously again, issuing a strict command to Da Zhang.

"Big Brother Tian, I..."

Da Zhang opened his mouth hesitantly and looked uneasy.

"Da Zhang! Answer me, understood?"

Su Nantian immediately cut off Da Zhang’s hesitation and demanded again.

"Understood! Big Brother Tian!"

Upon hearing this tone, Da Zhang immediately responded loudly again. He felt his whole body was filled with热血 (blood), as if he were about to burst into flames!

"Listen carefully. Whether it’s people like me who are executing tasks outside or the staff in logistics, we are all inseparable. So don’t have these incorrect thoughts again. Everyone is doing their part for the organization, without any distinction of rank or status!"

After Da Zhang calmed down, Su Nantian spoke earnestly and sincerely. His words were heartfelt and genuine, not just a formality but truly from the heart.

The more sincere he was, the more moving it became. It moved Da Zhang so much that he felt like crying.

Da Zhang felt his nose getting sore, and he spoke emotionally: "Big Brother Tian, you are truly great! It’s my fortune from past lives to have worked with you!"

"You’re back again."

Su Nantian felt a bit helpless and interrupted Da Zhang’s words, then said: "Now is not the time to talk about this. Quickly organize what I told you and let others have a plan of action."

After saying that, Su Nantian added: "By the way, tell the superiors for me. If Wu You’er’s condition worsens, I will proceed with my plan and take her out of the Wu family first."

"Ah! Big Brother Tian, but didn’t they say that this mission was to take the Wu family’s three people together? Just taking Wu You’er alone might not be enough, right?"

Upon hearing Su Nantian say this, Da Zhang immediately asked in confusion: "Big Brother Tian, isn’t that against the rules?"

"Is it more important to follow the rules or Wu You’er’s life?"

Su Nantian immediately cut off Da Zhang’s hesitation and added: "Didn’t you hear what I said? Wu You’er is already suffering from severe anorexia. If it gets worse, she won’t survive. In this situation, I can't just sit and watch."

"Yes! Big Brother Tian!"

Upon hearing Su Nantian’s analysis, Da Zhang also felt that what he said made sense.

After all, preserving the green mountains ensures there’s no shortage of firewood; they had to protect Wu You’er's life first. Otherwise, everything would be in vain.

After thinking it through, Da Zhang didn’t continue to persuade Su Nantian but instead earnestly said: "Big Brother Tian, I’ll report this. If the situation really reaches a special case, you can proceed with your own plan. The logistics team will cover for you, so don’t worry!"

Da Zhang also spoke with a determined tone to Su Nantian. If Su Nantian were there, he would have even patted his chest and vowed loudly.

"Thank you, Da Zhang."

Upon hearing Da Zhang agree to his request, Su Nantian felt a little relief and then earnestly thanked him.

"You don’t need to say such polite words, Big Brother Tian."

Upon Su Nantian’s thanks, Da Zhang felt a bit embarrassed and denied Su Nantian's words. He added: "The Nan Gong family and the Wu family are not easy to deal with. They’ve been thriving in inland port for years, so they must have their strengths. Big Brother Tian, be careful and prioritize your own safety in all tasks."

Da Zhang didn’t know what he was thinking, but he began to earnestly advise Su Nantian.

Su Nantian hadn’t felt genuine concern for a long time. Hearing Da Zhang’s straightforward care, he was momentarily stunned but soon felt a warm current in his heart.

"Alright, you’ve been thoughtful."

Su Nantian secretly smiled and said jokingly to Da Zhang: "After I complete the mission, I’ll treat you to a good meal at Jute Building."

"Woah! Then I should thank Big Brother Tian first!"

Upon hearing the words "Jute Building," Da Zhang’s eyes almost lit up. He was excited and thanked Su Nantian, then they exchanged a few more greetings before finishing the necessary tasks.

After that, Su Nantian pulled out the phone card and broke it apart, then resealed the phone in the soil of the potted plant. After doing these actions, Su Nantian involuntarily looked down at his palm with the broken phone card.

The next time he used that phone, who knew when it would be?

"Knock knock knock!"

As Su Nantian was deep in thought, he suddenly heard a knocking sound. He immediately regained his full alertness and became vigilant.

"Su Nantian! It's me, Jin Guanjia."

As Su Nantian was thinking about who was outside the door, the person outside introduced himself.

Upon hearing it was Jin Guanjia, the trusted assistant of Nan Gong Lin, Su Nantian raised his eyebrows and didn’t delay. He immediately walked to the door and opened it.

"Ah, it's Jin Guanjia! I didn’t expect you to come personally for something."

Su Nantian smiled and opened the door, making a welcoming gesture.

"It's Master Nan Gong who wants to see you."

Jin Guanjia also smiled gently and said to Su Nantian: "Come with me."

Chapter 688: Meeting the Person

"Master Nan Gong."

Upon hearing that Master Nan Gong wanted to see him, Su Nantian didn’t delay but immediately followed Jin Guanjia to the villa where Nan Gong Lin was recuperating.

Su Nantian didn’t need any other means to know that Nan Gong Lin’s condition had worsened again. His face was even paler than before, and his lips were especially white without any color, looking like a person on the brink of death.

Seeing this Nan Gong Lin, Su Nantian’s brows furrowed slightly but quickly concealed it.

It seemed that Nan Gong Lin's deteriorating body could no longer support much longer. When his health problems were exposed, the Nan Gong family would surely face a bloody upheaval.

"You noticed it? Cough... cough..."

Nan Gong Lin placed his left hand over his mouth and spoke with a weak voice, and the frequency of his coughs had increased compared to before.

"Master, please speak slowly. Have a drink of water."

Jin Guanjia looked worried and stood by Nan Gong Lin. Upon hearing Nan Gong Lin cough again, he immediately handed him a cup of warm ginseng tea and indicated for Nan Gong Lin to drink.

"No."

Nan Gong Lin waved his hand and didn’t take the cup.

After refusing Jin Guanjia, Nan Gong Lin turned his gaze to Su Nantian but didn’t dwell on the previous issue. Instead, he asked about the main purpose of calling Su Nantian over today.

"According to the servants, you and Yuyan had a quarrel in the pavilion outside. What exactly happened?"

Nan Gong Lin finally revealed his purpose, and this question also indicated that there were eyes everywhere in the Nan Gong family. No matter how small an event, it would not escape his notice.

Su Nantian was not surprised that Nan Gong Lin knew about this event. He was just confused: why did Nan Gong Lin show interest in such a small matter and specifically call him over to ask?

Was there something hidden behind this incident?

Thinking about it, Su Nantian's gaze darkened slightly but his face showed no signs. He was careful to conceal his emotions and didn’t show any expression that shouldn't appear.

"Master, you misunderstood. It was just the eldest son and the daughter arguing a few words. I was only trying to comfort the daughter. Otherwise, how could a lowly bodyguard dare to challenge the daughter?"

After thinking for a moment, Su Nantian decided to tell Nan Gong Lin the truth.

After all, since Nan Gong Lin already knew about this event, it meant he must have known the details. As for why he specifically called Su Nantian over to ask, that was something only Nan Gong Lin knew.

"Oh? That's how it is."

Nan Gong Lin nodded slightly and wore a thoughtful expression.

His current behavior made Su Nantian feel even more puzzled, unsure of what Nan Gong Lin was really trying to ask.

"What's going on with them? What were they arguing about?"

Nan Gong Lin continued to ask.

This question made Su Nantian's head ache again. It was the issue between the eldest son and daughter, and he had been caught in it—this wasn’t good. Now he was being questioned about it.

If he spoke, it would be spreading rumors and causing trouble; if he didn’t speak, it would be disloyal to Nan Gong Lin and not listening to his words.

This was truly a dilemma, no matter what he did, it would be a dead end.

"Did I not have the right to know about their quarrel?"

Nan Gong Lin seemed to understand what Su Nantian was thinking and deliberately spoke, with a tone that carried a hint of threat.

"Master, you’re joking. Since Master said it was just sibling squabbles, I, an outsider, shouldn’t have interfered."

Su Nantian smiled and laughed it off, carefully responding to Nan Gong Lin without giving him any opportunity or mistake.

But Su Nantian still felt confused about why Nan Gong Lin suddenly had the time to ask him these small questions. He couldn’t get an answer.

"Your words make sense."

Nan Gong Lin pondered for a moment and said softly, then suddenly lowered his voice and his expression became serious.

His face was already pale from the lack of color, and now with this serious expression, it looked even more eerie. Seeing his face made people feel uneasy.

"But if I really wanted to know, what would you do?"

The next sentence made Nan Gong Lin’s emotions shift abruptly. His voice was like broken stones, hitting Su Nantian's heart fiercely. At the same time, Nan Gong Lin’s sharp gaze was urging Su Nantian to give an immediate answer.

"Master, you’re joking. You are the head of the Nan Gong family with the highest status and supreme power. If you really wanted to know, I would certainly tell you truthfully."

Su Nantian pondered for a moment and had a rough guess.

It seemed he was trying to warn him indirectly.

Su Nantian couldn’t help but think, was Nan Gong Lin suddenly unwilling to let go of power and wanted to keep it firmly in his own hands?

If that was the case, this play would surely become more interesting.

Thinking about these things, Su Nantian collected his expression again and then said to Nan Gong Lin: "The daughter was worried that Master would be angry, so she asked the eldest son to handle his personal affairs. The eldest son didn’t like being managed by the daughter, so they quarreled."

Su Nantian quickly summarized the main points in simple language. After saying this, he added to Nan Gong Lin: "If Master wants more details, I can recount their conversation."

"No need."

Nan Gong Lin's gaze deepened and he looked at Su Nantian seriously, then withdrew his gaze. His face also had a look of satisfaction.

"Sometimes teeth accidentally touch the tongue, even siblings will have some small quarrels and conflicts. Since Yuyan didn’t want me to know about their quarrel, I’ll pretend not to know."

Nan Gong Lin continued speaking and his face had become much more relaxed.

Clearly, he was satisfied with Su Nantian’s tactfulness and enjoying the feeling of still being the supreme person in the Nan Gong family.

Chapter 689: Conclusion

"Good, it seems you have remembered who you truly belong to."

Nan Gong Lin was pleased with Su Nantian’s cooperation, who had not been dismissive but respectful. His smile grew wider and he was even more satisfied with Su Nantian, looking at him with a touch of genuine admiration.

Only when sitting in the center of power could Nan Gong Lin feel that he was still formidable and had great authority. However, when thinking about his increasingly deteriorating body, the joy on his face slightly receded.

"Master, I am a bodyguard of the Nan Gong family and naturally belong to you. Of course, I will follow your orders."

Su Nantian was very clear about why Nan Gong Lin had suddenly done this. He didn’t expose anything but cooperated fully with Nan Gong Lin’s words, treating him as the supreme person and following his commands.

This was successful in gaining Nan Gong Lin’s trust again.

"Yes! You better remember what you said today."

Nan Gong Lin, upon hearing this, had a more satisfied expression and liked Su Nantian even more. He felt that dealing with smart people was not bad at all, and he actually found it quite pleasant.

"I can put you in this position, I can also bring you down. You must remember this."

Nan Gong Lin’s words were like two pieces of candy for Su Nantian, then he gave him a slap to remind him of his identity.

"Master, I will always remember this."

Su Nantian also cooperated by lowering his head and answering earnestly. In reality, Su Nantian was telling himself that he truly remembered his mission; he had come for the mission, and no matter what Nan Gong Lin said, it was all just a formality. He didn’t need to take it seriously.

"Yes, that’s enough. You can go now. When you find anything else, come and report again."

After Nan Gong Lin showed off his authority, he felt much better. Seeing that he had finished teaching Su Nantian, he waved his hand and let him leave.

"Yes! Master."

Su Nantian obediently left without any intention of staying or defying Nan Gong Lin.

Su Nantian remained respectfully lowered his head, showing respect for Nan Gong Lin. Soon after, he left Nan Gong Lin’s room and as soon as he stepped out, the respect on his face disappeared immediately, replaced by a scornful sneer.

Su Nantian looked up at the room where Nan Gong Lin held meetings and then shook his head slowly. He thought to himself that it seemed the Nan Gong family was indeed at its end and had no more time left.

He even vaguely guessed that they might not survive until the wetland bidding plan was executed.

"Master, do you really trust this Su Nantian? I think he’s still a bit strange."

After Su Nantian left, Jin Guanjia began to express his thoughts to Nan Gong Lin. Especially thinking about Su Nantian’s rise in the past six months, like a bamboo shoot after rain, suddenly emerging. He couldn’t help but feel strange.

"Master, maybe we should be careful and observe him more?"

Jin Guanjia thought for a moment and finally voiced his true thoughts. After saying this, he carefully watched Nan Gong Lin’s reaction, waiting for his answer.

But Jin Guanjia didn’t expect that after he said this sentence, he received a sharp glance from Nan Gong Lin.

"What? Jin Guanjia, do you think I’m old and have lost my ability to recognize people?"

It was Jin Guanjia who lacked the sense of timing and had unfortunately hit Nan Gong Lin’s nerve. His intention was good, just wanting to warn Nan Gong Lin about Su Nantian.

But Nan Gong Lin had just felt his power was weak and couldn’t handle family matters properly, and he had been tested by external forces. He felt insulted at being looked down upon.

Plus, he had just shown off his authority over Su Nantian and regained the feeling of being superior. Now Jin Guanjia came out to say that he might have been deceived by Su Nantian and told him to be careful.

How could Nan Gong Lin feel happy?

Nan Gong Lin even felt Jin Guanjia was mocking him, thinking he had lost his sharpness from when he was young and was now an old man.

Thinking about this, Nan Gong Lin’s face became even more severe. His lips were tightly pressed together, looking very serious and terrifying, making people fear him deeply.

Jin Guanjia had been in his position for many years because he was smart and perceptive, not just relying on luck.

So Jin Guanjia had only been careless for a moment and was too worried about Su Nantian possibly deceiving Nan Gong Lin, so he had spoken out bluntly. He hadn’t noticed Nan Gong Lin’s expression.

Now, upon seeing Nan Gong Lin’s face turn serious and hearing his harsh words, Jin Guanjia immediately realized the important issue.

Jin Guanjia first touched his forehead, which was sweating nervously, then immediately explained: "No! Master, you really misunderstood me. Even if I had the heart of a bear and the courage of a leopard, I would never have such thoughts!"

Jin Guanjia immediately apologized and spoke softly. Then he softened his tone and flattered Nan Gong Lin: "Master is naturally sharp-eyed, still a master of horses. I would never doubt your ability to recognize people!"

After saying this, Jin Guanjia changed his tone and shifted the blame entirely onto Su Nantian. His words were sincere, as if he was only concerned about Nan Gong Lin and had spoken out so boldly.

"It’s just that I think Su Nantian's background is too strange, and he entered the Nan Gong family so quickly. We must be cautious!"

After saying this heartfelt speech, Jin Guanjia immediately used the old relationship to appeal to Nan Gong Lin: "Master, I was wrong. I overstepped my bounds! Please forgive me for this time!"

Jin Guanjia said these words and was even willing to kneel on the ground to beg for forgiveness.

At the same time, Jin Guanjia was extremely regretful and thought about how he had spoken so quickly. He felt like regretting it immediately!

But he was familiar with Nan Gong Lin’s temperament and had managed to make amends.

Chapter 690: Master-Servant Conflict

"You, really..."

Nan Gong Lin was just in a bad mood and had been unwell recently. Outside, there were also threats everywhere, and he was slightly showing signs of weakness. Other families were watching closely like a bloodthirsty mouth, waiting for the Nan Gong family to show any weakness and then swallow them whole.

Nan Gong Lin had thought about these complex matters, plus Jin Guanjia’s words that weren’t very pleasant, which made him angry in an instant.

But now, after Jin Guanjia apologized immediately and spoke softly to him, his mood slightly eased. However, his face was still somewhat grim.

Nan Gong Lin had become particularly sensitive to these keywords because of his health, especially worried that others would think he needed to step down. He had already felt powerless.

It was because of these reasons that Nan Gong Lin took Jin Guanjia’s words so seriously and became angry, almost ready to argue with the old butler who had accompanied him for years.

"Never mind, be careful next time and don’t make the same mistake."

Nan Gong Lin took a deep breath, his mood slightly calmed down. However, his tone was still cold. But since he had spoken this way, it meant he had forgiven Jin Guanjia and pardoned him.

So when Jin Guanjia heard this, he immediately sighed in relief and was extremely grateful. Jin Guanjia then quickly apologized to Nan Gong Lin: "Thank you, Master. I will remember this and never make the same mistake again!"

"Alright, there’s no need to say these words anymore."

Nan Gong Lin heard Jin Guanjia's apology and waved his hand casually, indicating he had forgiven him. Then he continued: "I know who Su Nantian is. I also know you are concerned, but Su Nantian is just a young man in his early twenties. Even if he has scheming or other intentions, he is definitely not my match!"
