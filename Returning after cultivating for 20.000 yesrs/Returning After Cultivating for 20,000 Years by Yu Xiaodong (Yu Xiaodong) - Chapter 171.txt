It was obvious to any perceptive person that Master Hong wasn’t a good man, and they knew he had ulterior motives. Yet Xu Xiangning charged straight in as if she was completely unaware that Master Hong was merely using her to climb the ranks.

The moment he thought of this, Xu Hai felt a headache, especially the temples throbbing painfully.

“Your elder sister’s nature has always been like this; haven’t you known that yet?”

Old Lady Xu immediately saw through Xu Hai’s thoughts. She merely smiled and spoke with a meaningful tone.

It was said that no one knows their child better than their mother. They were her own flesh and blood, and she had raised them herself. Naturally, Old Lady Xu understood the natures of her two children.

“Enough. You don’t need to dwell on this matter. Speak, what did you come for?”

Old Lady Xu interrupted Xu Hai’s thoughts, telling him not to dwell on Xu Xiangning anymore. She shifted the topic back to business.

“Mother, it’s like this: I’ve been secretly watching Master Hong’s people as per your orders. When my elder sister left the Hong household, I saw his subordinates rushing in and out hurriedly. It seems they’ve found some clues.”

Xu Hai was the second-in-command of the Xu family. Naturally, he could control his emotions and restrain them. Upon hearing Old Lady Xu’s words, he immediately suppressed his feelings and focused on the matter at hand.

“Oh, so they’ve truly found something?”

Old Lady Xu now showed interest in Xu Hai. She leaned forward slightly, her body language revealing genuine curiosity without the slightest pretense.

“Should I have my men follow them?”

Xu Hai continued to inquire. He had already dispatched people, ensuring two preparations and avoiding any mistakes.

“You’ve already sent them, haven’t you?”

Old Lady Xu directly pointed out the truth. Their tactics were all learned from Old Lady Xu’s subordinates.

“Don’t hide it; just say it plainly.”

Old Lady Xu spoke again. Naturally, she understood why Xu Hai had hidden the truth—it was to prepare for both scenarios. Since his intention was good, she didn’t dwell on it.

Xu Hai felt embarrassed when he realized his mother had uncovered his plan, rubbing the back of his head awkwardly. “Mother’s words are correct. I have already sent people after them, as I thought they would uncover some clues.”

“Then go and watch. If there are any changes, come inform me.”

Old Lady Xu nodded in agreement and didn’t reprimand Xu Hai.

This was the right way. The world is full of people who keep their true intentions hidden. Everyone’s depth remains concealed, and even those in close positions like family must keep some secrets. One must be cautious and reserved.

Moreover, as long as she was alive, the Xu family remained prosperous. But after her passing, who knew if Xu Hai and others could maintain this legacy? While she lived, she would teach them thoroughly, allowing them to learn more. This way, they could avoid many obstacles in the future.

Old Lady Xu felt that Xu Hai’s move was quite good and was satisfied with it. However, as a mother, no one wished for their son to keep secrets from them. Thus, she adopted a conservative attitude without praising or reprimanding him.

“Yes, Mother.”

Xu Hai nodded immediately and then left.

After Xu Hai departed, Old Lady Xu’s expression turned serious. She would have to keep a close eye on Master Hong.

She knew what Master Hong was scheming and what his true intentions were. Therefore, she would cut it off at the source, ensuring Master Hong had no opportunity to threaten the Xu family.

As a local tyrant, if Master Hong didn’t threaten their safety, Old Lady Xu wouldn’t waste her energy managing him. However, if he did pose a threat to their interests, she wouldn’t allow him to grow unchecked.

If Master Hong attempted to threaten them through a few incidents, he was mistaken. Even if he used Xu Xiangning as leverage, Old Lady Xu would make the difficult decision to sacrifice her daughter to protect the family.

This resolve and ruthlessness allowed Old Lady Xu to maintain the Xu family’s position for years, keeping them at the forefront. Few men could match this, let alone a woman.

This further highlighted Old Lady Xu’s exceptional intelligence and merciless methods.

“First, the gentleman arrived. This is the Huagui Garden; all of this belongs to Master Hong.”

The taxi driver dropped off Su Nantian at Huagui Garden, stammering nervously as he feared provoking this man.

The world was like that—fearful of the strong and bullying the weak. Thus, the driver naturally feared Su Nantian.

“How much do I owe you?”

Su Nantian remained expressionless, preoccupied with how to deal with Master Hong. He had no time for other matters.

Yet Su Nantian’s emotionless face appeared as a new threat to the driver.

“No, no, it’s not needed. Let me consider it free service for you. Enjoy your ride!”

The taxi driver shook his head and waved his hands, unwilling to accept Su Nantian’s fare. He feared that if he took the money, he would be beaten shortly after.

This small fare might as well be a life-saving payment!

Su Nantian frowned, wondering what this man thought of him. A despot who exploited the people?

Thinking this, Su Nantian repeated his question: “How much do I owe you?”

This time he emphasized the words, ensuring the driver heard clearly. His brow was furrowed tightly, urging the driver to quickly report the fare.

“Say.”

He uttered another word, frowning at the driver.

Upon hearing Su Nantian’s words and seeing his expression, the driver realized he was serious about paying. He sighed in relief but immediately reported a number.

“No need for change.”

Su Nantian tossed over a bill and strode forward without looking back.

This was Master Hong’s territory, he mused. He would see what talent this man possessed.

“What person?”

As soon as Su Nantian stepped in, he was blocked by the guards at the entrance.

They warned him with stern gazes and scolded: “This isn’t where you belong. Get out!”

These men had been spoiled by Master Hong, believing their organization was invincible and fearless of anyone.

Seeing Su Nantian alone, they thought him easy prey and threatened: “Did you hear me? You little brat! Move quickly, or do you not know where you are?”

“I’m here to see Master Hong.”

Su Nantian replied lazily. Since they didn’t give him proper respect, he wouldn’t waste time on politeness.

Thus, Su Nantian said calmly: “Where is he? I don’t need to enter. Just have him come out.”

“Hey, are you brainless? What status does Master Hong hold, and what are you? Do you even deserve him to greet you?”

The two guards saw Su Nantian’s arrogance and insolence. They laughed at his attitude, thinking he was overconfident.

At first, they thought Su Nantian might truly be here to meet Master Hong. But after hearing his arrogance and knowing that those who sought Master Hong wouldn’t be so haughty, they dismissed the idea.

They now confirmed that Su Nantian had come to provoke them. In other words, in their eyes, he was just a fool looking for trouble.

“Is Master Hong not here?”

Su Nantian raised an eyebrow, showing no fear of the guards’ warnings. He smiled and continued to provoke: “Or is Master Hong too afraid to come out and meet me?”

“Stupid kid!”

The two subordinates, seeing Su Nantian’s continued insolence, grew angry and cursed him: “If you keep talking like that, we’ll tear your mouth apart!”

Chapter 855: Hong Family

“Stupid kid. I thought you were just brainless, but now that you’ve insulted us and still dare to provoke further, it seems you don’t know where you are!”

After saying this, the two subordinates rolled up their sleeves. Seeing Su Nantian alone, they exchanged a glance and rushed forward without even using weapons to teach him a lesson.

They had joined the Hong family recently, doing menial tasks like errands and collecting protection money. Occasionally, they guarded the gates—nothing significant. They were quite frustrated.

Now, encountering Su Nantian who dared to provoke them, they saw him as a convenient target. Naturally, they couldn’t miss the chance.

“Hmph.”

Su Nantian let out a cold laugh, showing no fear. He wondered who was the real troublemaker here.

He thought to himself that soon, these men would learn who was truly overconfident and reckless.

“Ugh!”
“Ahh!”

The two men rushed at Su Nantian with fists, intending to punch him.

Yet for some reason, they hadn’t even touched Su Nantian’s clothes before being thrown back by an odd force.

They both cried out in unison, falling to the ground in a pitiful heap, unable to even get up.

“Huh?”

Su Nantian smiled at the two men lying on the ground: “Can I enter now?”

After saying this, he let out another cold laugh, unbothered by the scene.

For some reason, Su Nantian felt this moment was oddly familiar, as if he had experienced something similar before.

But it didn’t matter. He had come here for two reasons: to deal with Master Hong and to uncover his origins. If doubts arose, they would be resolved soon. Thus, Su Nantian didn’t dwell on the suspicion now.

“Who are you?”

The two subordinates were stunned, struggling to stand up and watching Su Nantian with caution.

If before they had merely considered Su Nantian a fool who dared to provoke them, now they were truly terrified. They hadn’t even touched him before being thrown back.

This ability was too strange. Even Master Hong himself hadn’t shown such power.

Thinking this, the two men exchanged a glance, their fear of Su Nantian deepening.

“You… you don’t dare to act recklessly, do you? I tell you this is Master Hong’s territory. If we call out, there are plenty of men coming to deal with you. Even if you’re strong, how can you escape three heads and six arms?”

One of them threatened Su Nantian, trying to scare him away.

“Right, if you’re smart, leave now. Otherwise Master Hong won’t forgive you!”

The other man nodded in agreement immediately, as if Su Nantian wouldn’t have another chance.

“Hmph.”

Su Nantian let out another cold laugh. He had already dealt with them, yet they still didn’t know when to stop. Should he call them foolish or fearless?

“You’ve got it backwards.”

At this point, Su Nantian didn’t continue but left a lingering suspense.

These men claimed they could deal with him, so let them see who would end up being dealt with. Su Nantian had never feared this.

After thinking this, he let out another cold laugh and his gaze became more playful.

“You!”

The other man tried to warn Su Nantian again, but before he could say another word, Su Nantian had already grabbed his throat.

“Take me in and tell me where Master Hong is.”

Su Nantian spoke coldly, each word deliberate. There was no room for negotiation—he was giving an order, not asking their opinion.

“I don’t know!”

The man seemed to think Su Nantian wouldn’t do anything to him. He defiantly refused: “Hmph! Even if I knew, I wouldn’t tell you. I won’t back down!”

“Good. You have backbone.”

Su Nantian spoke as if praising him, but before the words finished, his fingers tightened slightly, snapping the man’s neck.

The man didn’t even have time to show surprise before dying instantly, his limbs going limp and no chance of survival.

“Ah! You! You actually killed someone!”

The remaining man was terrified, watching Su Nantian as if witnessing something horrifying. He screamed continuously.

He was so scared his legs gave out, and he fell to the ground, unable to meet Su Nantian’s eyes.

“You… you…”

His mouth opened and closed, but he could only utter that one syllable, as if his throat was blocked.

“Since you wouldn’t cooperate, this is your fate. I think you would be willing to help me, right?”

Su Nantian crouched before the man and continued asking. His face was expressionless, his voice neither high nor low. Yet after the previous man’s death, it had formed enough intimidation.

Su Nantian smiled and slowly opened his hand, idly fidgeting with his fingers. The implication was clear.

“Or do you also want me to finish your loyalty and send you to meet the King of Hell?”

This Master Hong was a local tyrant, had committed countless crimes. Those who came to find him were armed and experienced.

Why did these gatekeepers seem so useless, killing one man and silencing him?

Thinking this, Su Nantian let out another cold laugh. He thought Master Hong wasn’t as formidable as he imagined, perhaps just a name.

“I… I’ll take you in.”

The man was terrified and finally regained his voice, but he had just witnessed his comrade’s death. How could he dare to defy Su Nantian?

Especially now, seeing Su Nantian’s threatening expression, he dared not delay.

“I… I’ll take you in.”

He repeated the answer again.

Chapter 856: The Guide

“Don’t kill me.”

The man trembled like a sieve, begging repeatedly, fearing Su Nantian would kill him.

“Hmph.”

Su Nantian let out a cold laugh but didn’t harm the man.

Before leaving, he glanced at the corpse on the ground and let out another cold laugh. He wasn’t a saint who would spare even an ant.

These men had come for his life, otherwise they wouldn’t have carried guns. Thus, Su Nantian returned their actions in kind and felt no pity for them.

He had given them a chance, but they didn’t cherish it. Thus, he fulfilled their wish and took their lives.

But this man was willing to cooperate, so it seemed they needed to scare them into obedience.

Thinking this, Su Nantian let out another cold laugh.

The man leading the way was now trembling uncontrollably, but he dared not show it. He feared any movement would anger Su Nantian and result in his death.

Thus, he kept controlling his body, but the more he controlled it, the more violently it shook.

Su Nantian watched his trembling and felt it was as laughable as autumn leaves being swept away.

“This is where he is—Master Hong is in that grand hall.”

The man stammered, speaking the sentence multiple times before it was coherent. His voice was broken and incoherent.

He hoped Su Nantian would spare him, but his calculation was wrong. Su Nantian immediately grabbed his throat.

“What? You said if I brought you here, you wouldn’t kill me?”

The man’s eyes widened in terror, not expecting Su Nantian to act again. He thought Su Nantian wouldn’t harm him, but he was wrong.

He was terrified and struggled desperately.

Yet his strength against Su Nantian’s was like an ant trying to move a mountain—no chance of success.

Su Nantian let out another cold laugh: “When did I say I wouldn’t kill you? I was just making you cooperate.”

After speaking, he twisted the man’s neck.

He wouldn’t allow a threat to escape. If he let this man go, he was certain that before reaching the hall, countless people would surround him.

Su Nantian wasn’t afraid of them but didn’t want to waste time on these troubles.

He had pressing matters with Master Hong and needed to uncover his origins. He didn’t have time to waste on these people.

After thinking this through, Su Nantian took larger and steadier steps.

He hoped Master Hong wouldn’t disappoint him, that he had something of interest. Otherwise…

Thinking this, Su Nantian’s gaze darkened, his hands clenching tightly.

If the man had tricked him, he would show him his strength.

With that, Su Nantian stepped in with determination and steady steps.

Although he had killed these two men, preventing them from sending messages to inform the Hong family, they were gatekeepers. Naturally, someone would notice.

Moreover, those watching from the security cameras saw Su Nantian’s actions and witnessed him harming these men. They all became frantic, immediately calling the inner line to inform Master Hong.

Upon receiving this call, Master Hong jumped up from his chair in shock, unable to accept the terrifying truth.

“What happened? Did you see who it was?”

Master Hong raged, his eyes wide with anger.

He had a reputation in M City, even as just a local tyrant. Normally, no one dared to provoke him.

Yet Master Hong hadn’t expected this man to be so bold, daring to challenge him and coming with such intensity. He looked like no easy opponent!

“What did you do? You couldn’t even guard the gate properly!”

Master Hong was furious, thinking he had missed this opportunity. The man had already entered the gate successfully, and he was furious.

He thought outsiders would set up a checkpoint to stop intruders but hadn’t expected them to be so useless, allowing someone to be easily defeated.

In fact, Master Hong was mistaken. These men were guarding the gate but had no idea of Master Hong’s reputation in M City. Who would dare to provoke?

They had been under Master Hong for years and hadn’t encountered such a fool. Thus, they were momentarily stunned.

But even if they reacted quickly, they couldn’t match Su Nantian’s speed.

Thus, no matter how angry Master Hong was at their uselessness, there was nothing he could do.

And Su Nantian had successfully entered.

“Master Hong, the intruder has already reached the hall!”

Bai Assistant was also extremely panicked and immediately informed Master Hong.

Upon hearing this, Master Hong was furious: “What did you do? You couldn’t even guard such a big person, and now he’s in!”

If this incident spread, where would Master Hong’s dignity go? Others would mock him for having no guards and allowing anyone to enter freely.

But now wasn’t the time to dwell on this.

Since the intruder had entered, Master Hong must ensure he never left.

But Master Hong didn’t yet know who his opponent was or that this was Su Nantian, the dreaded star.

Knowing the intruder had entered the hall and would soon reach his office, Master Hong immediately called the inner line to notify others.

He ordered them all to gather and bring out their strongest weapons.

In short, this time he had been insulted and allowed to enter, so he would not let him leave alive.

Master Hong’s dignity could not be challenged!

After thinking this through, Master Hong’s expression turned dark. He wanted to see who was so bold as to dare challenge him.

Chapter 857: Discipline

“Yes, Master Hong!”

Bai Assistant heard Master Hong’s orders and immediately rushed to催促 the subordinates.

Now they had to act quickly to stop this intruder, ensuring he didn’t harm Master Hong.

Otherwise, if Master Hong was harmed, they would be scattered and useless. No need for the enemy to scare them; even a few threats would leave them broken.

Bai Assistant had found this support and didn’t want to lose it so soon.

But no matter how fast they organized, they couldn’t match Su Nantian’s speed.

And Su Nantian had decided to find out clearly from Master Hong, so he didn’t waste more time. He quickly reached the hall where Master Hong was.

“Who are you?”

The guards at the hall saw Su Nantian and immediately watched him with suspicion.

They had heard the calls and knew who this intruder was, so they were now very fierce and vigilant.

“Stop! This isn’t where you belong. Stand your hands up and kneel down, or I’ll shoot!”

One of them pointed a gun at Su Nantian and warned him.

Since Master Hong had ordered to kill on sight, they didn’t need to waste time with Su Nantian.

They first warned him politely; if he cooperated, they would let Master Hong interrogate him. If not, they could kill Su Nantian immediately.

But when the man thought Su Nantian would oppose, he was surprised. Su Nantian slowly raised his hands and stopped moving forward.

The man with the gun was stunned, then looked at Su Nantian in confusion.

Had the information from outside been wrong?

Su Nantian wasn’t a difficult opponent, but these two gatekeepers had failed to notice him. Otherwise, why would he cooperate so easily?

And Su Nantian’s appearance didn’t look like a fierce person. He looked more like a well-bred nobleman.

This subordinate couldn’t connect Su Nantian with the troublemaker.

He didn’t know that Su Nantian wasn’t resisting because he planned to let them take him to see Master Hong. If it saved effort, he didn’t mind. After all, his goal was to meet Master Hong.

“Don’t move.”

Su Nantian raised his hands and slowly knelt down, cooperating with their demands.

The man saw Su Nantian’s cooperation and immediately approached him. They exchanged a glance and bound Su Nantian tightly with chains.

Of course, to keep him quiet, they used iron chains. Unless Su Nantian was the Hulk reincarnated, he couldn’t break free or cause any threat.

“Stay quiet. I’ll take you to see Master Hong!”

They were happy, thinking they had caught a difficult opponent and could show off to Master Hong.

But they didn’t know they had encountered a麻烦.

“Okay.”

Su Nantian nodded and followed them obediently. If these two men turned around to look at Su Nantian, they would see his relaxed expression, as if going on a trip. He didn’t look like someone captured to meet an enemy leader.

These two men quickly led Su Nantian to Master Hong’s office, knocked on the door, and reported: “Master Hong, the intruder has been captured.”

“Oh? Is that true? Bring him in quickly!”

Upon hearing this, Master Hong was stunned and then immediately regained his composure.

He had thought the man was so strong that Bai Assistant was so nervous and called him immediately. But it turned out the regular guards had already caught him.

After thinking this through, Master Hong felt Bai Assistant was overreacting and maybe even trying to take credit.

Bai Assistant didn’t know that his effort had been seen as scheming and trying to gain favor, which would have made him feel wronged if he knew.

“Who are you? Why did you break into my Hong family at this hour?”

Master Hong looked at the young man and frowned, asking coldly.

No matter what his purpose was, he would first find out who he was and then have him executed in the hall before all subordinates.

This would restore his authority and warn those who were thinking of rebelling.

At this moment, Su Nantian removed his human mask and revealed his true face.

He thought that since Master Hong’s people recognized him, they would act accordingly. But he hadn’t expected their expressions to be completely unfamiliar.

Their questions were also entirely foreign, as if they didn’t know him at all.

“Don’t you recognize me?”

Su Nantian frowned and asked, not answering Master Hong’s question but instead questioning him.

Had he made a mistake? Did they not know who he was?

“Brave enough to challenge Master Hong! You dare not answer his question, you little brat!”

Bai Assistant stepped forward and urgently defended Master Hong’s dignity.

Master Hong glared at Bai Assistant: “Silence, who are you to speak?”

He hadn’t even given the order yet, and Bai Assistant was already acting like a boss. He wondered if Bai Assistant had been using his authority to act recklessly before.

Thinking this, Master Hong’s gaze became even more disapproving toward Bai Assistant.

He planned to deal with Bai Assistant after handling this young man, and if he was uncooperative, he wouldn’t keep him.

“Interesting. Should I know you? You’re young but talk big.”

Master Hong let out a cold laugh and focused on Su Nantian.

But as he said this, he was also carefully observing Su Nantian, thinking perhaps he had met this young man before but forgotten.

Regardless, the man was unknown and came with intensity, so he needed to deal with him quickly or risk leaving a problem.

Chapter 858: Cleaning Up

Master Hong didn’t know that while he was thinking this, Su Nantian was also thinking the same.

“Why did you send your men to capture me if you don’t know who I am?”

Su Nantian, seeing the man’s expression wasn’t fake and that he truly didn’t know him, coldly asked.

“Looking for you? When did I look for you?”

At this point, Master Hong suddenly stopped and his expression turned serious. He seemed to have realized a terrifying result and took a few steps back: “So you are Su Nantian?”

He hadn’t expected the person he was looking for to come to him.

But his appearance?

“You…”

Master Hong hesitated, looking at Su Nantian with doubt.

“Yes, I am Su Nantian. The one you were looking for.”

Su Nantian saw the man’s doubt and answered: “You don’t even know what I look like, yet you sent people to capture me. Isn’t that funny?”

Su Nantian coldly mocked, but seeing the man’s completely unfamiliar gaze, Su Nantian felt discontent.

“Since you don’t know who I am, why did you send people to capture me?”

He had lived peacefully in the small fishing village. Why did they come to disturb his life? This made Su Nantian very discontented.

Moreover, Su Nantian had traveled all the way to find Master Hong and uncover his origins.

But he hadn’t expected Master Hong to be equally ignorant of him, not even having seen his true face.

This made Su Nantian feel even more discontented, and he had lost most of his interest in this interrogation.

“Good, I was worried about where to find you. You’ve come to me, so don’t blame me for being harsh!”

Master Hong changed expressions several times before finally making up his mind.

After all, he had searched for Su Nantian the whole time and now that he was here, he would definitely use him well.

“Bai Assistant, tie him up tightly and send him to the Xu family!”

“The Xu family?”

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian’s brow furrowed again and he whispered the name Xu family.

Could the mastermind behind the scenes be the Xu family, and Master Hong merely a pawn?

After thinking this through, Su Nantian didn’t want to waste time. He broke free from the chains in front of everyone’s astonished gaze.

“Ah!”

The iron chains around Su Nantian shattered, flying in pieces. Many subordinates didn’t notice and were hit directly, with several hitting their internal organs and spitting out large amounts of blood.

Even Master Hong was startled, but he dodged quickly and avoided being hit.

“You… you…”

He had seen the video before, knowing Su Nantian wasn’t ordinary. But he hadn’t expected him to be this strong—this one move was beyond human limits.

“Why did you pretend to be captured?”

Thinking this, Master Hong asked sharply.

How could Su Nantian have been caught by a minor subordinate?

“I had something to ask you, but I didn’t know where you were. To save time, I let them take me and bring me here.”

Su Nantian spoke lightly, lacking patience.

After saying this, his expression became worse: “Unfortunately, you don’t have what I want.”

After saying this, Su Nantian’s expression became even more sour. He felt he had wasted his time on a futile effort.

“Why are you all standing there? Attack! Take this man down!”

Upon hearing Su Nantian’s words, Master Hong didn’t know why he felt uneasy, as if something bad was about to happen.

After regaining his composure, he coldly ordered the subordinates. They immediately took out their weapons and aimed at Su Nantian: “Don’t move!”

They would shoot him immediately if he moved, turning him into a sieve.
