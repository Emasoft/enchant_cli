“Damn!”

Su Nantian saw Yue Han’s reaction and immediately pressed his hand onto Yue Han’s wrist, feeling a chaotic pulse. His face turned ashen.

“Frost Mist? Who would still concoct such a thing?”

After confirming his conclusion, Su Nantian pulled out his acupuncture kit and swiftly inserted needles into several acupoints on Yue Han, who was on the verge of unconsciousness, stabilizing his condition first.

Then he abruptly raised his head and barked at the bewildered onlookers: “Quick! Everyone grab something hot—the hotter, the better. Turn up the air conditioning to maximum.”

With Su Nantian’s command, the intensive care room erupted into chaos. Doctors, nurses, and Yue Family bodyguards, along with the vice president and department heads, scrambled frantically.

Upon hearing Su Nantian’s shout, Yue Xiaoshan rushed forward, shouting anxiously: “What happened to my father?”

“Yue General is suffering from cold poison. Raise the temperature immediately.”

Su Nantian had no time to waste, replying curtly: “You’re not helping. Contact the family right away. His condition isn’t suitable for staying in the hospital; prepare a greenhouse at home and send a sealed transport vehicle to fetch him.”

“Right, I understand.”

After the initial panic, Yue Xiaoshan regained composure and methodically placed calls.

Meanwhile, others dragged in heating equipment; some even brought over medical alcohol stoves, rapidly raising the room’s temperature.

Originally at twenty degrees, it now felt like an oven, drenching everyone in sweat. Fortunately, Yue Han’s condition stabilized.

Yue Xiaoshan wiped her forehead and asked: “Mr. Su, what’s going on? How did my father suddenly collapse?”

“Miss Yue, based on my guess, Yue General has been poisoned for a long time. This time, the accumulated toxins erupted, nearly costing him his life.” Su Nantian honestly shared his speculation.

“But my father’s daily meals and medication are all handled by me. How could he be poisoned for so long? I didn’t even notice!”

Yue Xiaoshan felt immense guilt, her composure shattered. Her lips trembled, eyes desperate.

Chapter 297: Urgent Measures

“This substance isn’t technically poison,” Su Nantian sighed, explaining slowly. “It’s called Frost Mist; it enhances one’s yin energy and is effective for treating heat-related ailments.”

“Hmph, just make it up,” the department head Zhou Bing, a rotund man, scoffed. “If it’s so effective, how could it kill someone? Putting all this heat in the room might even overheat the patient.”

“Shut your mouth! I’ll deal with you later!”

Before Zhou Bing could finish, the vice president Zhu Hua barked at him. Frightened, Zhou Bing retreated silently.

To be honest, the sudden incident caught everyone off guard. Yet Yue Family’s attitude toward Su Nantian was questionable. Clearly, he was a guest of honor, yet Zhou Bing attempted to assert himself, prompting Zhu Hua’s growing disdain. Had it not been for their old friendship, Zhu Hua would have dismissed Zhou Bing immediately.

“Director Zhou, the ancients said: ‘Three parts poison in medicine.’ You’re a doctor yourself,” Su Nantian retorted sharply. “Frost Mist is an effective remedy for heat, but overuse accumulates cold poison. Once it reaches a critical point, this is what happened to Yue General.”

“Oh, I see now,” Zhu Hua said, trying to ease the tension. “This isn’t a direct poison, so toxicity tests wouldn’t detect it. But when it erupts, it can kill. Yue General’s condition seems bleak.”

“Mr. Su, is there no way to counter Frost Mist?” Concerned for Yue Han’s life, Yue Xiaoshan sounded impatient.

“There is a way,” Su Nantian mused for two minutes, recalling clues from his experience.

“What is it?”

Hearing a solution, Yue Xiaoshan’s dim eyes lit up: “Mr. Su, please speak freely; the Yue family will spare no effort to comply.”

Su Nantian nodded, speaking softly: “I recall a herb called Yangyang Vine. It’s intensely yang and hot, capable of neutralizing Frost Mist’s properties to expel the cold poison from Yue General.”

“Yangyang Vine?” Yue Xiaoshan froze. “What is that herb? I’ve never heard of it.”

Though she didn’t recognize the herb, seeing Su Nantian’s grave expression made her realize it was extremely rare. Acquiring it would be no easy task.

“Ah!”

At the same time, Yue Han, lying amidst the heat sources, suddenly opened his eyes and shouted wildly.

Su Nantian feared an accident and swiftly struck Yue Han’s neck with a hand blade, knocking him out. He then inserted silver needles into his body to relieve the cold poison’s pressure, ensuring absolute safety.

“Phew,” after finishing, he finally sighed in relief.

“Mr. Su, is Yue General safe for now?” As the hospital’s vice president, Zhu Hua expressed concern.

For a figure like Yue Han, even if poisoned beyond cure, he couldn’t die at the hospital. Otherwise, how would wealthy patients dare seek treatment here?

“Yes, Vice President Zhu, Yue General is safe for now.”

Su Nantian sensed Zhu Hua’s hidden thoughts and reassured him: “I’ve already informed Miss Yue. They’ll send a vehicle to fetch Yue General immediately. Given his current state, he shouldn’t stay hospitalized.”

“Oh, that’s good,” Zhu Hua relaxed slightly. As long as Yue Han didn’t have issues on his turf, everything was manageable.

He then realized his tone was inappropriate and added: “With the Yue family’s resources, they can surely provide better medical care. We can’t risk Yue General’s life.”

“I agree,” Su Nantian smiled faintly. “Vice President Zhu, when the Yue family’s people arrive to fetch Yue General, I’ll accompany them. I hope to requisition some equipment from your hospital for continuous monitoring of Yue General’s condition.”

“That’s natural,” Zhu Hua waved his hand generously. “I’ll have the equipment prepared according to the intensive care standards. Take it with you.”

“Thank you, Vice President Zhu,” Su Nantian thanked repeatedly. Yue Xiaoshan slightly relaxed.

Time passed, and the Yue family’s people arrived promptly. Under Su Nantian’s direction, they loaded Yue Han into a sealed transport vehicle, stabilizing the heat sources. They rushed back to the Yue family’s villa.

In the villa, bodyguards followed Yue Xiaoshan’s orders to convert a basement room into a high-temperature chamber. Su Nantian and hospital staff arrived, setting up monitoring equipment before carefully placing Yue Han inside.

After hours of work, by eight o’clock in the evening, Su Nantian confirmed Yue Han’s condition was stable. He and Yue Xiaoshan returned to the villa’s hall, where servants prepared food.

Yue Xiaoshan had no appetite, barely eating a few bites before greeting Su Nantian and retreating to her second-floor room.

In just one day, so many events had transpired. Even with her strong mental fortitude, she struggled to recover quickly and needed rest.

After watching Yue Xiaoshan enter her bedroom, Su Nantian lingered in the villa’s hall for a few minutes before deciding not to return to the Kaili Hotel that night.

With so much turmoil, he doubted peace would come. His skills could ensure Yue Xiaoshan’s safety.

Meanwhile, the Yue family’s loyal retainers sprang into action. One group called around to find Yangyang Vine, willing to do anything to obtain it and save Yue Han. Another group secured the house, preventing external threats from exploiting the chaos.

Su Nantian observed the Yue family’s frantic efforts and sighed in relief. As long as they didn’t panic, no major disaster would occur.

At Yue Xiaoshan’s bedroom door, there was no movement. He wanted to comfort her but hesitated over what to say. Standing by the stairs, he felt conflicted.

After two minutes, Yue Hai, the family’s steward, hurried over and said: “Mr. Su, I’m truly sorry for today’s chaos. We didn’t have time to properly entertain you.”

Though Su Nantian was officially Yue Han’s private doctor, determined by Yue Xiaoshan, Yue Hai dared not treat him as a servant. Respect was essential.

This steward had served the Yue family for years, earning trust from both Yue Han and Yue Xiaoshan through his sharp discernment. He knew Su Nantian was exceptionally capable.

Such people needed to be allied with, not offended. Especially during the family’s crisis, seeking external support was crucial. Thus, he couldn’t afford to neglect Su Nantian, so he rushed over to build rapport.

“Oh, no problem,” Su Nantian waved his hands, smiling: “Uncle Hai, don’t be so polite. From now on, we’re family. Just call me by my name or Xiao Su.”

“Given today’s chaos, I’m sure you’ll need help. Don’t hesitate to ask,” he added smoothly, instantly bridging the gap between them.

“Indeed, family,” Su Nantian’s words made Yue Hai nod in agreement, his tone easing.

He pointed to the room next to Yue Xiaoshan’s and said: “Xiao Su, Miss Yue isn’t in good shape. I’m worried. This room is closest to her and unoccupied. I’ll have new furnishings sent over. You can stay here tonight.”

“Ha, no problem,” Su Nantian chuckled and nodded. Even without Yue Hai’s arrangement, he would have volunteered to stay. He’d rather guard the hall all night than risk Yue Xiaoshan’s safety.

His reason for staying was to ensure her security. Though the Yue family seemed calm, hidden enemies hadn’t surfaced yet. If they seized the chance to attack, Yue Xiaoshan would be in danger.

Su Nantian wouldn’t let that happen. He positioned himself firmly to protect her absolute safety, eliminating any obvious threats immediately.

“Chu Yan, it’s like this…” Su Nantian briefly updated Chu Yan on progress. The reply was normal, with all high-tech equipment installed and Chu Yan finalizing tests—expected to start tomorrow.

*Crash!*

At that moment, a muffled explosion echoed from the second-floor window of the Yue villa. Glass shattered, and the source was clearly Yue Xiaoshan’s room.

“Danger! Enemies have infiltrated!”

Su Nantian, with his sharp ears and experience, instantly realized the situation. He cursed inwardly—had he not been preoccupied with suppressing the vampire prince’s core, his spiritual awareness would have covered the entire villa. He could’ve detected even a mosquito, avoiding this passive state.

It was too late to dwell on it. He leaped up the wooden stairs, burst into Yue Xiaoshan’s room, and entered in under two seconds.

“Ah!”

At this moment, Yue Xiaoshan, who had been sitting at her dressing table in a daze, finally snapped out of it. She let out a scream as Su Nantian rushed in.

“Miss Yue, come here!”

In desperation, Su Nantian lunged forward and grabbed the stunned Yue Xiaoshan. They rolled off the pink princess bed to the other side.

Everything happened in a flash, leaving the infiltrating black-clad assailants stunned. Their target had been effortlessly taken away—unacceptable.

The lead assailant barked: “Quickly finish off Miss Yue!”

His tone was strange, though he spoke Mandarin. His diction was unclear, with incorrect intonation.

Like a parrot mimicking speech, it was evident he wasn’t a native Chinese speaker.

“Understood.”

Five assailants had infiltrated, with the lead foreigner and four trained killers. After receiving orders, they drew thirty-centimeter military knives from their waists and lunged at the princess bed from different directions. The move was clean and efficient, no hesitation.

“Damn, all隐狼 (Yin Wolf) military gear. These killers aren’t simple,” Su Nantian observed, even in the dark. He could clearly identify their weapons’ origins.

These were top-tier international brands, expensive and limited in production—hard to acquire even with money. Clearly, the perpetrators had invested heavily in this attack on Miss Yue.

Chapter 298: Temporary Repulse

“Remember, whatever happens, stay here and don’t move.”

Su Nantian’s composure was excellent. After assessing the five killers’ strength, he whispered urgently to Yue Xiaoshan: “I estimate they’ll arrive in a minute. If we hold for one minute, we’ll be safe.”

Without Yue Xiaoshan’s presence, even if he could only use a fraction of his power, Su Nantian would’ve fought the five killers head-on. But with her as a vulnerable target, he hesitated.

“Don’t seek glory, just avoid failure.” Su Nantian wasn’t one for reckless actions. He remembered his mission: protect the Yue family’s safety. As long as Yue Xiaoshan was unharmed, he’d take the safest route to resolve everything.

“Okay, I’ll do as you say.” Yue Xiaoshan nodded palely, gripping her dress hem anxiously.

Su Nantian’s words were light—surviving a minute would turn the tide. But five killers, all ruthless and cold-blooded. They could end Yue Xiaoshan’s life with a single slash, no more than a second.

A minute was enough for her to die dozens of times. To survive, Su Nantian had to hold out.

After five seconds of instructions, the four killers were nearly upon them. He glanced sideways and calculated his strategy.

Then he spotted some fluffy plush toys at the bed’s foot—Yue Xiaoshan’s beloved playthings. An idea struck him.

He channeled power into his wrist, grabbed one, and hurled it at the nearest assailant. It struck the man’s head.

“What is this?!”

The killer, expecting to complete his mission and collect the bounty to live abroad, felt轻松 (relaxed). Unexpectedly, Su Nantian’s sudden attack left him dazed. He instinctively thought someone was ambushing him.

The struck killer roared, wildly swinging his knife and slicing the plush toy into pieces. Fluffy fibers scattered like snow.

“Now!”

Seeing an ambush, the other killers diverted their attention. Su Nantian was delighted.

He repeated his tactic, grabbing two plush toys and hurling them at two other killers. Meanwhile, he closed in on the remaining one.

The move was seamless, taking two seconds—most couldn’t react.

“Die!”

With a step, grip, and punch, Su Nantian unleashed eight-tenths of his power to create a breakthrough. He aimed to kill one killer first, reducing their combat strength maximally.

*Crack!*

Su Nantian’s punch was immense, no less than two thousand catties of force.

The killer was slender, around 150 jin (75 kg), and couldn’t withstand the blow. He was instantly knocked backward, colliding with a wall with a闷响 (muffled sound). His physical strength was exceptional; an ordinary person would’ve had bones shattered.

“Here he is!”

At the same time, the other four killers realized and rushed toward Su Nantian, aiming to subdue him first before dealing with Yue Xiaoshan.

They miscalculated. With his current cultivation, Su Nantian hadn’t achieved immortality yet, but he had reached a preliminary stage of invincibility.

If Su Nantian were easy to defeat, he wouldn’t have survived so many events.

“Good!”

Su Nantian roared, not dodging but sidestepping and planting his left foot. He swept his right foot, knocking the first attacker off balance.

Unluckily, the man’s tilt direction blocked the path of the next killer. The latter couldn’t stop, colliding with him.

The momentum sent them tumbling like logs, rolling several meters before Su Nantian kicked them unconscious.

“Idiots! Embarrassing!”

Seeing his men so easily defeated, the foreign leader slapped his forehead, looking troubled.

After receiving the mission, they’d thought their target was a helpless woman, easy to complete. They hadn’t expected a killer to appear, making them no match. Escaping was difficult.

“Boss, what do we do?”

Seeing three brothers defeated by Su Nantian without resistance, the remaining killer turned to the foreign leader for guidance.

“Retreat!”

The foreign leader was a hardened man. After weighing the pros and cons, he realized he couldn’t match Su Nantian. Continuing would only worsen their situation if the Yue family’s guards arrived.

So he sacrificed his three men, retreating two steps through the window and fleeing faster than a rabbit.

“Hmph, you’ve got sense.”

Su Nantian sneered. He’d considered chasing but decided against it. With Yue Xiaoshan frightened and the villa in danger, hidden killers might still lurk. He chose to prioritize her safety over pursuing.

He approached the first killer who’d hit the wall, kicked him again to ensure he wouldn’t wake soon. Then he turned to Yue Xiaoshan, trembling in the corner: “Miss Yue, are you alright?”

“N-no… I’m fine.”

Though she said “fine,” her expression was poor. The night had been too intense, like a rollercoaster—she wasn’t fine at all.

“Miss Yue, are you alright?”

As soon as she spoke, a group rushed in from the door Su Nantian had kicked open—Yue Family guards.

They’d arrived in under a minute, confirming Su Nantian’s prediction: if they held for one minute, the killers wouldn’t succeed.

Chapter 299: Relieved but Cautious

“I’m fine.”

In front of her family’s guards, Yue Xiaoshan forced a composed demeanor, adjusting her disheveled clothes and instructing: “These three are killers who attempted to attack me. Mr. Su defeated them. Take them down and guard them closely—try to interrogate the mastermind.”

“Yes, Miss Yue.”

The guards, seeing Su Nantian end the fight swiftly and subdue the infiltrators, felt genuine admiration.

Initially, they’d thought Su Nantian was just a regular doctor, albeit skilled. Who knew he was also a martial arts master? Strength deserved respect.

They paired up, dragging the three killers from the second floor to a secret room in the villa’s backyard for interrogation.

As a family that had stood firm for years, the Yue Family naturally had methods to extract information. Getting the killers to talk wasn’t hard.

“I don’t think you’ll get anything useful,” Su Nantian sighed, shrugging after the killers were taken away. “These killers are hired; they don’t know who ordered them. You’ll be disappointed.”

“But I need them to talk,” Yue Xiaoshan said coldly after regaining composure. “It seems my father was right—family internal issues and someone trying to seize power. Even foreign forces are eyeing us. The leader was clearly a foreigner who couldn’t speak Mandarin well. These people are audacious.”

Su Nantian sighed: “No choice but to accept it. People like them live by the edge of a knife; anyone who pays will have their heads cut off. I think such attacks will increase. You must stay safe.”

Truthfully, he hadn’t lived abroad but had seen pigs run on TV. News reports daily covered similar incidents. He could guess the killers’ nature and had become accustomed to it.

Some international killer organizations were wealthy and powerful, acting like regular armies. They secretly controlled governments, supporting figures who would rise to power—unbelievably powerful.

Compared to the chaos abroad, China was a paradise for mercenaries and killer organizations. Unless offered irresistible benefits, they wouldn’t dare enter. This consensus was well-known; no one wanted to live too long.

“Understood,” Yue Xiaoshan felt Su Nantian’s genuine concern.

As she was about to say something to ease the tension, Yue Hai rushed in, out of breath: “Miss Yue… I…”

He was elderly and didn’t have the stamina of the guards. Running a few steps left him gasping, struggling to speak clearly.

“Ah, Uncle Hai, I’m fine! No harm done.” Yue Xiaoshan rushed forward, gently patting his back to help him catch his breath.

After catching his breath, Yue Hai said: “Miss Yue, it was too dangerous. Thank goodness Mr. Su was here. If anything happened to you, how could I explain it to the master?”

Yue Hai had raised Yue Xiaoshan since childhood. As the family’s steward, he cared more about her safety than anyone else.

With Yue Han in poor condition, the burden on him was heavy. If Yue Xiaoshan had another accident, he’d be devastated.

“Uncle Hai, why so pessimistic? I’m lively and unharmed. Don’t worry,” Yue Xiaoshan said, glancing at Su Nantian hesitantly: “Besides, Mr. Su is so capable. With him protecting me, it’s definitely safe. Just trust me.”

“Ah, yes,” Yue Hai sighed in relief and turned to Su Nantian: “Mr. Su, your protection of Miss Yue is crucial.”

“Right, Uncle Hai. With me here, Miss Yue will suffer no harm,” Su Nantian said resolutely.

This confident stance pleased Yue Hai, who silently thought this move was correct. It would be safer to quietly bind Su Nantian to the Yue family.

Yue Hai then looked at the ruined bedroom and shivered: “Miss Yue, you can’t stay here tonight. I’ll have another room rearranged—next to Xiao Jun’s, so he can respond quickly if anything happens.”

“Fine.”

Yue Xiaoshan didn’t object to Yue Hai’s arrangement. Then he asked Su Nantian: “Mr. Su, the entire villa is in high danger. Someone broke through the window to threaten Miss Yue. Do you have any suggestions to prevent this?”

“I don’t dare call it advice, but I have some ideas,” Su Nantian said, scanning the room. “First, all external windows must be replaced with the highest standard bulletproof glass—making it harder for outsiders to break in.”

“Next, titanium alloy grid window bars must be welded outside. Also, all curtains should stay drawn 24/7 to prevent snipers from hiding.”

After addressing the windows, Su Nantian paused: “The villa’s outer walls need electric fences and heat-sensing alarms. Any intruders would be detected instantly. Patrols should double, and more large guard dogs should be kept—sometimes they’re more effective than humans…”

He detailed the necessary improvements for the Yue family’s villa, and Yue Hai nodded in agreement. Even Yue Xiaoshan was stunned by his meticulousness, surprised he noticed even the smallest details like lawn and carpet changes.

Chapter 300: Reasonable Deduction

“Excellent, Mr. Su. Your suggestions are correct. I’ll have them implemented immediately. They can be rearranged within a day,” Yue Hai said, rushing out to direct the guards.

Some modifications seemed absurd, like titanium alloy window bars and heat-sensing devices—hard to obtain in the market.

But with the Yue family’s resources, money wasn’t an issue. For their safety, spending a few million was trivial.

As Yue Hai left, Yue Xiaoshan turned to Su Nantian: “Mr. Su, when did you become so close with Uncle Hai? He called you Xiao Jun—wasn’t that disrespectful?”

Normally, Su Nantian was a newcomer to the Yue family. The staff would usually call him Mr. Su.

Yue Hai calling him Xiao Jun made Yue Xiaoshan uneasy. After all, Su Nantian had saved her father’s life and was clearly powerful. She worried that Yue Hai, relying on his status, might not respect Su Nantian enough, causing offense.

“Ah, Miss Yue, we met and got along well downstairs. Our relationship naturally grew closer. I call him Uncle Hai, he calls me Xiao Su—no problem,” Su Nantian blinked. “Also, we’ll meet often in the coming days. Let’s skip the formalities and just call each other by name. No need for Miss Yue or Mr. Su—too distant, right?”

“That’s better,” Yue Xiaoshan hesitated for a moment before nodding. “I won’t be formal then.”

She grabbed a thicker jacket from the wardrobe and turned to Su Nantian: “Nantian, I can’t sleep. Can you sit with me downstairs?”

“Sure,” Su Nantian nodded, and they left the bedroom. He glanced at the broken window across from him, his expression thoughtful.

These killers had chosen their timing well—exactly when the Yue family faced this crisis. Their actions seemed like a vulture waiting to snatch the opportunity.

After years in society, Su Nantian had seen through human nature’s cruelty. He didn’t believe in coincidences. These “coincidences” were carefully planned.

In other words, the killers had been tipped off about the Yue family’s crisis. They knew today would be a big event, so they came to exploit it, aiming to eliminate Yue Xiaoshan.

Following this logic, Su Nantian considered another possibility: these killers might be connected to those secretly scheming within the family.

As Yue Xiaoshan had said, since her father’s health declined, his meals and supplements were all handled by her. It should’ve been safe. Yet he was poisoned with Frost Mist, a non-toxic substance that didn’t kill instantly.

To accumulate enough toxicity to erupt, it would take at least ten days without interruption. Thus, someone had secretly administered Frost Mist to Yue Han for so long under her nose—indicating high status within the family.

This narrowed down suspects significantly, excluding external guards who wouldn’t have such privileges.

As Su Nantian followed Yue Xiaoshan into the villa’s hall, they sat facing each other on the sofa. Yue Xiaoshan tilted her head, frowning deeply.

“Xiaoshan, don’t worry. With me here, no matter how many killers come, they’re useless.”

Su Nantian felt心疼 (painful) and tried to comfort her softly: “Also, once we find Yangyang Vine, Yue General’s toxins can be neutralized. I’ll treat him afterward—he’ll fully recover.”
