The pressure and rhythm of the massage increasingly met Su Nantian's needs. He lay on the large bed, his face turned toward Wang Feixue's side.

A slight tilt of his head revealed to Wang Feixue Su Nantian's broad nose, deep-set eyes, and thick lashes.

This man, as handsome as Apollo from ancient Greek mythology, could he truly save her from the fire?

Wang Feixue nervously bit her lip. Her hands continued working without pause.

Under the tranquil atmosphere, Su Nantian dozed off for a while.

It was unclear how long had passed. Wang Feixue's wrist began to ache and refused to obey, even developing a cramp. Yet she dared not stop without Su Nantian's command.

The erratic rhythm disturbed Su Nantian. His deep-set eyes opened, revealing radiant eyes that made Wang Feixue's heart tremble. Her wrist finally began to cramp.

"Ah..." Wang Feixue winced in pain, immediately pressing and rubbing the cramped hand. Su Nantian naturally heard her groan.

"What's wrong?" Su Nantian sat up, a pleasant masculine scent wafting toward her. Wang Feixue was momentarily intoxicated.

"Nothing... just..." Wang Feixue dared not complain further. She stretched her limbs, applying slight pressure to relieve the cramped hand.

Su Nantian glanced at Wang Feixue's convulsing left hand, his eyes flickering with concern.

"Cramp," Su Nantian said. He extended his hand to take Wang Feixue's cramped hand, gently massaging it.

After sufficient rest, the cramped hand quickly returned to normal.

Su Nantian then said, "I was a bit tired. I dozed off. From now on, just wake me up directly instead of pressing so hard."

After a half-day massage, Su Nantian's body was fully relaxed. He felt an endless flow of energy, more comfortable than a night's sleep.

But Wang Feixue blushed at Su Nantian's mention of "next time."

"What time is it? Should we go out?" Su Nantian had dozed for a while. His voice was still low and husky, as if he hadn't fully woken up.

Hearing Su Nantian's suggestion to leave, Wang Feixue anxiously said, "But you haven't taken me yet..."

She lowered her head at the end. Her shy expression was hidden, leaving Su Nantian with a seemingly reluctant crown.

"I said I would help you this time and will keep my promise. You don't need to resentfully offer your body. Now, go out," Though Su Nantian was indeed moved by the beautiful woman before him.

But to have Su Nantian engage with a girl who didn't want it for material reasons was truly challenging.

Wang Feixue understood Su Nantian's words, but as a pure girl, she couldn't say the three words "I am willing."

Yet she couldn't let Su Nantian send her away like that. Her thoughts became chaotic, and in desperation, tears immediately welled up.

Su Nantian was taken aback. "You're made of water."

He then moved to the edge of the bed, sitting half on it as if dispelling drowsiness.

Suddenly, a soft and warm body embraced Su Nantian from behind. The scent of a woman flowed with the air toward Su Nantian, providing dual sensory pleasure that made his body tense.

Wang Feixue understood Su Nantian had become aroused. Her soft, boneless hands tightened further, as if determined to encircle Su Nantian tightly and make them perfectly fused.

"I have to take you. My grandfather was too shocked, now in the intensive care unit. The hospital fee is one thousand yuan a day. I truly can't afford it..." Her voice trembled uncontrollably.

She tried to steady her heart and said, "If it weren't for the high surgical fees, I wouldn't be stuck in this pit. Now if you don't take me, I'll be auctioned off by Wang Feisi. Please..."

"Please take me. Only if you do, I can have an endless flow of funds to save my grandfather and continue working here without being harassed or framed."

Finally, the woman said, "I am willing..."

Su Nantian's tense body froze. Almost instinctively, he flipped Wang Feixue onto the soft large bed. He wiped away her tears and kissed them tenderly.

"Salty," Su Nantian said.

The room was filled with sensuality.

In the ancient, luxurious room, incense smoke rose from the censer, making the room more ethereal.

Suddenly, a woman's soft cry echoed through the room, pulling it back to reality.

On the bed, Su Nantian supported himself with one hand beside Wang Feixue's ear. His eyes burned intensely. Wang Feixue's long hair was scattered on the soft bedsheet, like a fairy descending from heaven.

A sweat droplet slid down Su Nantian's forehead, tracing the elegant curve of his neck and silently falling onto Wang Feixue's undulating chest. The woman shivered.

Su Nantian's eyes grew even more intense. He slowly lowered his body with possessiveness, making Wang Feixue blush and shift.

"Again?" Wang Feixue said, barely able to withstand it. Her cherry lips spoke with a hoarse voice.

The room was once again filled with sensuality, waves of passion rising.

Time passed quickly. The two on the bed seemed to have rested enough. Su Nantian got up, gathering all their clothes from the floor and placing them on the bed.

Chapter 243: Sweetness

The two carefully dressed, but Wang Feixue's long dress was wrinkled and couldn't be worn. Su Nantian raised an eyebrow, feeling a bit guilty as he touched his nose, saying, "Stay here for a while. I'll go buy you some clothes."

"Don't... no need," Wang Feixue was only firm in specific moments, like when she had begged Su Nantian earlier. That determined gaze was what truly touched Su Nantian.

But in daily life, Wang Feixue was extremely afraid of refusing others. Even this "no need" she said very quietly, fearing Su Nantian would get angry.

"What?" Su Nantian was momentarily stunned. He sat back on the bed, looking at Wang Feixue holding the wrinkled clothes. He teased, "Do you really want to go out wearing this so everyone knows what happened?"

This teasing successfully made Wang Feixue blush. She playfully glanced at Su Nantian, covering her slender figure with the thin blanket.

Wang Feixue walked down barefoot. The floor was covered with a thick carpet, otherwise Su Nantian's brow would have furrowed to kill a fly.

Behind the room's screen was a large zitan wood wardrobe with intricate carvings. The latticed door exuded a faint, delicate fragrance.

Su Nantian raised an eyebrow at the wardrobe, feeling even more satisfied with the room.

Wang Feixue held the blanket's edge in one hand and opened the heavy door with the other. Inside were rows of dresses.

Each was tailored for Wang Feixue, complementing her beauty perfectly.

"Wang Feisi really went all out for you," Su Nantian said, picking up a long dress and trying it on Wang Feixue. The high-quality fabric proved it was from a renowned brand.

Wang Feixue blushed slightly, lowering her gaze to search through the clothes. "It was worth it to successfully keep you. Wang Feisi thinks it's worthwhile."

"What about you?" Su Nantian picked another short dress. "Do you think it's worthwhile?"

If not for Wang Feixue's heartfelt "I am willing," Su Nantian would never have touched a single hair of hers.

"I naturally think it's worthwhile..." Wang Feixue's voice grew quieter. A flush appeared on her beautiful face. She grabbed a dress and, without looking at Su Nantian again, hurriedly went to the bathroom of this room.

Moments later, the sound of dripping water came from the bathroom. Su Nantian smiled and lazily lay back on the bed, gazing at the ceiling before closing his eyes to rest.

When Wang Feixue came out of the bathroom dressed, she saw Su Nantian lying on the bed. Her heart fluttered like a little deer.

Su Nantian's natural beauty, his deep-set features and golden proportioned body all exuded his charm.

At this moment, he lay on the bed resting, resembling a prince from a fairy tale. Wang Feixue was delighted again.

Light footsteps were still heard by Su Nantian, who opened his eyes and sat up. Seeing Wang Feixue in a lake-blue long dress, it further highlighted her pure and spotless beauty, like a water sprite.

If not for the red mark on her neck, it would be perfect.

Su Nantian was in a good mood. He approached and wrapped his arms around Wang Feixue's waist. The feeling of her slender figure made him even more satisfied. He looked her over from head to toe, then pointed at the red mark on her neck and said, "It's exposed. Are you not bothered?"

Wang Feixue looked confusedly at her neck, then went to the bathroom again. When she came out, a wide necklace was around her neck, covering the red mark perfectly.

"Let's go," Su Nantian picked up his coat from the chair and walked toward the door. Wang Feixue hurriedly ran to Su Nantian's side, instinctively wrapping her arm around his.

They exchanged a smile. Wang Feixue's eyes showed a hint of sweetness.

After opening the door, the two lovers holding hands were startled by the lewd Wang Feisi.

Su Nantian's brow furrowed. He stared at the embarrassed Wang Feisi and coldly asked, "What are you doing?"

Wang Feixue also gasped, quickly hiding behind Su Nantian.

Wang Feisi looked quite embarrassed and shook his head. A fawning smile was on his face as he hurriedly explained, "I just thought you should wake up now. I came to check."

That servile appearance made Su Nantian unable to get angry, but the scare had already made him dislike Wang Feisi.

He pulled Wang Feixue's hand and said, "Your bait was good. I'm happy to take the hook. But I'm not an ordinary fish. Whether I stay on the hook long-term depends on myself."

Su Nantian's tone wasn't angry, but it was enough to make Wang Feisi tremble.

"I'm taking Wang Feixue with me. From now on, this bar is under my control." Su Nantian didn't look at Wang Feisi's surprised and happy face again. He pulled Wang Feixue's hand and headed straight for the elevator.

Wang Feixue's joy was evident on her face.

After they left the bar, they realized it was already after six in the afternoon. Wang Feixue was stunned and said, "Time passed so fast. I never felt it before."

That unintentional line of dialogue made Su Nantian quite pleased. "Are you trying to confess to me?" Su Nantian asked her as he walked.

Wang Feixue was momentarily stunned. She blinked twice, unsure of what Su Nantian meant. Her eyes were extremely beautiful—when she had begged earlier, they were hazy and lovely; when beneath him, they were dewy and lively. Now they were bright and clear—truly impossible to get enough of.

After thinking for a while, Wang Feixue understood what Su Nantian meant. Her face suddenly turned red, giving a peach-like flavor that made Su Nantian even more fond of her.

"You really blush easily. When you're agreeable, your face turns red; when you're not, it instantly goes white." Though Su Nantian's words were true, they still carried a touch of teasing.

Chapter 244: Ex-Boyfriend

Wang Feixue naturally understood. She playfully glared at Su Nantian, her girl's thoughts clearly visible on her face.

They walked a few more steps together. A sudden voice echoed behind them.

"Wang Feixue! Feixue!" It was a male voice, laced with disbelief and anger.

Su Nantian had no memory of this voice. Moreover, the man called Wang Feixue's name. Su Nantian raised an eyebrow and wanted to turn around to see who it was. But Wang Feixue had already stiffened in place.

"What's wrong?" Su Nantian asked her. Wang Feixue opened her mouth to speak but found it difficult to say anything.

Su Nantian was puzzled again. He looked toward the direction of the voice.

A well-dressed young man ran over, but his smile was extremely annoying. This made Su Nantian dislike him.

The man wore brand-name clothes and had a Cartier watch on his wrist. He looked very noble, but Su Nantian found no trace of genuine refinement in him. It was clear he was a hypocrite.

"Wang Feixue!" The man approached and saw Wang Feixue's arm around Su Nantian. His face immediately changed, his voice turned cold and he raised it several degrees.

Wang Feixue was startled. She instinctively hid behind Su Nantian but this action only further angered the man.

"What's your relationship with him!" The man pointed at Su Nantian and shouted, "Is he chasing you!"

"It's none of your business," before Wang Feixue could answer, Su Nantian looked at the furious man with disdain and replied, "Wang Feixue is my woman. Who are you?"

Su Nantian's words were highly oppressive, immediately guessing that Wang Feixue had some past with this man.

Hearing Su Nantian's voice turn cold, Wang Feixue feared he would misunderstand and quickly replied, "He's my ex-boyfriend, Ma Dong. But believe me, there's nothing between us. I've already broken up with him."

To prove the truthfulness of her words, Wang Feixue stepped forward and bravely said to Ma Dong, "A few years ago, my family fell into decline. You attached yourself to another woman and broke up with me that day. You said clearly we had no relationship anymore."

Wang Feixue tightly gripped Su Nantian's arm, fearing he would get angry.

"Now you're just a passerby. You have no right to say this to me and my boyfriend. Please leave." Wang Feixue's tone carried a hint of determination.

The woman before Ma Dong was no longer the weak one from years ago. Now, Wang Feixue had a glimmer of firm independence in her soul, making Ma Dong's eyes go wide. His heart was filled with regret.

When Wang Feixue's family fell into decline, Ma Dong had clung to a rich woman. To avoid Wang Feixue asking for money, he had broken up harshly and said severe things.

Later, with the help of that rich woman, Ma Dong had successfully transformed into a man with some achievements. At least in terms of money, he was quite wealthy.

But now, Ma Dong had accidentally met Wang Feixue. After years of separation, she had become more beautiful. Her eyes that seemed to speak stirred waves in Ma Dong's heart. He couldn't help but call out to her.

Now, Ma Dong had power and status. He felt this encounter was a chance from heaven to compensate for Wang Feixue.

Ma Dong's gaze fell on Su Nantian. Today, Su Nantian had coincidentally worn high-end clothes but in a low-key luxurious style. There were no brand labels on him, making Ma Dong even more certain Su Nantian was just a poor guy. His arrogance grew further.

"Wang Feixue, I know you're saying this out of anger. You're angry about our breakup."

"But now I have everything. If you're willing to return, I'm ready to give you a chance and take care of you properly."

Ma Dong sincerely said these words, but they sounded extremely sarcastic to Wang Feixue's ears, even a bit nauseating.

Su Nantian calmly watched Ma Dong without any intention to stop him.

Ma Dong thought Su Nantian was afraid. He became even more smug and continued to speak.

"You're just looking at this pretty boy's good looks. But what can he give you? You need care and protection, not just a pretty face."

"I know that那段 past made it unforgettable. Now I'm giving you this chance to get back together with me, come with me."

Ma Dong became more excited and reached out to grab Wang Feixue.

Before his hand could reach, Ma Dong felt a heavy force hit his hand. Instantly, his palm was filled with excruciating pain.

Ma Dong cried out in pain and quickly pulled back his hand, as if he had touched something terrifying.

Su Nantian kept the action of hitting his hand away, making Ma Dong even more angry.

"You dare to hit me?" Ma Dong roared.

"A mischievous monkey, I can't hit?" Su Nantian was half a head taller than Ma Dong. His gaze looked down at Ma Dong's face, carrying a strong sense of contempt. This made Ma Dong's heart tremble.

Then thinking about his identity card, Ma Dong forced himself to be brave. He pointed at Su Nantian and scolded, "You ungrateful bastard! Do you know who I am? You dare to do this to me!"

Ma Dong's provocative words fell into Su Nantian's ears, but they sparked Su Nantian's interest. He smiled and said, "I really don't know who you are."

It wasn't that Su Nantian was afraid, but this was the first time he had a desire to teach someone a lesson. However, without knowing his background, Su Nantian couldn't fully enjoy it.

Seeing Su Nantian asked, Ma Dong immediately became confident. "I am... "

"Senior Brother!"

Before Ma Dong could finish, he heard several voices behind Su Nantian. Then four energetic young men approached Su Nantian.

Liu Yang excitedly said, "Senior Brother, I didn't expect to see you here. What are you doing?"

He Tao slapped Liu Yang's head and laughed, "It's the entrance of the bar. What else could Senior Brother be doing? You're really stupid."

Gao brothers also smiled and greeted Su Nantian respectfully.

Chapter 245: Teaching a Lesson

Suddenly, so many people arrived. Wang Feixue hid behind Su Nantian again. Su Nantian smiled and touched the top of Wang Feixue's head.

This tender gesture made the four men shocked.

They had thought that a few days ago, Su Nantian had dueled with Wu Lianxing. Everyone thought Wu Lianxing was Su Nantian's girlfriend. Then who was this delicate beauty before them?

Liu Yang, unable to bear questions, asked first, "Senior Brother, who is this girl? New girlfriend?"

This question made Wang Feixue tense. The other three looked at Liu Yang like he was a fool.

Liu Yang didn't feel anything wrong. He calmly blew bubbles in his mouth.

"Not a new girlfriend, she's my woman," Su Nantian didn't get angry. He answered Liu Yang's question with a double meaning, but it shocked the four men almost jumping.

Not a new girlfriend. That meant Wu Lianxing still had feelings? Being his woman meant he was indeed related to this woman!

"Wow, that's a lot of information," Liu Yang was stunned and spit out the bubble gum. He looked back and forth between Su Nantian and Wang Feixue.

He Tao quickly broke the tension after a brief surprise, saying, "Senior Brother is different from us. That's normal, Senior Brother is so strong, having two women at once, it's natural."

He Tao laughed twice and then asked, "Senior Brother, where are you going now? Are you leaving?"

"Don't go," Liu Yang immediately jumped out and said, "Don't leave. Have a drink with me Senior Brother. It's rare to meet."

Gao brothers also nodded in agreement.

Su Nantian smiled, "I would like to leave, but a stranger suddenly blocked the way. I can't go."

A hint of impatience flashed in Su Nantian's eyes.

The four men knew Su Nantian wasn't talking about them. That only left this stranger.

And this stranger looked pale and trembling, not like someone who could block the way.

Liu Yang looked at Ma Dong's face and frowned, "Have I seen you somewhere before? I must have."

Liu Yang thought carefully.

Ma Dong's face became even more fearful.

The next moment, Liu Yang suddenly realized and shouted, "You're the deputy manager of my family's branch, right? I was promoted by my aunt."

Liu Yang's gaze toward Ma Dong changed.

Liu Yang's aunt was notorious for her flirtatiousness in the Liu family. Even as a woman, she was no less than men in this aspect. A few years ago, Liu Yang's aunt had promoted a man from outside—Ma Dong.

At that time, Liu Yang was sent to this branch for internship by Grandpa Liu. He had to meet Ma Dong every day, and over time he left some impressions.

Ma Dong's business ability was strong. Perhaps his talkative nature made Liu Yang dislike him.

At that time, when Liu Yang's aunt lost interest in Ma Dong, she stopped caring about him and went abroad to develop the market at the British branch. Ma Dong didn't dare to linger, so he stayed in the position of deputy manager without promotion.

"Senior Brother, I know him. He's our branch's deputy manager," Liu Yang said carelessly. "Did he provoke you? Should I teach him a lesson?"

This made Ma Dong's face pale immediately. He realized the reality—Su Nantian's identity must be much higher than these young masters.

Otherwise, how could Liu Yang, with his family's power in Fengcheng, be so respectful to this small guy?

"Senior Brother..." Because he didn't know Su Nantian's name, Ma Dong followed Liu Yang and called him "Senior Brother."

Liu Yang slapped Ma Dong's head, "Can you call Senior Brother like that? What did you do to our Senior Brother?"

Ma Dong's ears rang from the slap, but he still forced himself to stay calm and said, "Senior Brother, my eyes were bad. I disturbed you. Please forgive me. I won't appear in front of you again."

This fearful tone made Liu Yang even more curious, but Su Nantian didn't speak. So Liu Yang couldn't ask further.

Su Nantian's gaze, like looking at an ant, lightly fell on Ma Dong's head. But Ma Dong felt it as heavy as a thousand jin.

"If apologies were useful, what's the point of patrols?"

Su Nantian's words clearly indicated he didn't accept Ma Dong's apology. Liu Yang, a clever person, immediately understood Su Nantian's meaning.

He extended his hand and hooked Ma Dong's shoulder.

"You see, you died in the wrong place. You didn't know your worth. Now it's too late; no one can save you."

Liu Yang slapped Ma Dong's face, making a "slap" sound.

Although it wasn't painful on the face, Ma Dong's heart jumped rapidly with Liu Yang's rhythm.

With Liu Yang and the four people taking care of it, Su Nantian felt better. Wang Feixue no longer feared and stepped out from behind Su Nantian. Her gaze toward Su Nantian was more determined, because she knew Su Nantian would protect her and had the ability to do so.

When Su Nantian lowered his head to look at Wang Feixue, their eyes met. Su Nantian smiled first, and Wang Feixue blushed again.

This scene was teased and celebrated by Liu Yang's four people, as if they were enjoying the situation.

Su Nantian wrapped his arm around Wang Feixue's waist, about to leave. But before leaving, he turned back toward Ma Dong restrained by Liu Yang and smiled mockingly.

Until Su Nantian held Wang Feixue out of the bar's street, Wang Feixue was still stunned. When they were alone, Wang Feixue couldn't help but pull Su Nantian's sleeve.

Su Nantian naturally raised an eyebrow and leaned his ear toward Wang Feixue, waiting for her to speak.

"Those people you know?" Wang Feixue bit her lip and asked, a little embarrassed. "They looked so strong. Even Ma Dong was afraid of them."

That scene made Wang Feixue truly understand the difference between Su Nantian and herself.

"Don't worry," Su Nantian said, patting Wang Feixue's head affectionately. His tone was gentle: "They are my classmates from school. Today we met by chance. Ma Dong is the deputy manager of Liu Yang's family branch. It's natural for Ma Dong to fear Liu Yang."

Chapter 246: Impolite

"Neurology Hospital," Su Nantian said. Wang Feixue was startled, "How did you know it's the Neurology Hospital?"

Her eyes looked at Su Nantian like a startled rabbit. Su Nantian smiled, "I guessed."

In Fengcheng city, various hospitals stood side by side—private and public. The Neurology Hospital was the cheapest with decent medical treatment. For Wang Feixue's situation, staying at the Neurology Hospital was the most stable choice.

The car quickly drove to the hospital. Wang Feixue looked at Su Nantian with admiration, gradually filled with surprise and respect.

After paying again and getting out of the car, Su Nantian took Wang Feixue's hand and walked into the hospital.

Almost immediately upon entering, the nurses at the front desk were all drawn to Su Nantian. It was night and there weren't many people. These night shift nurses usually chatted about their patients, but now they were eager to flirt with Su Nantian.

Su Nantian's charm had made them completely ignore Wang Feixue beside them.

"Hey! Isn't that Su Nantian? The model from the Bashan magazine!" One nurse couldn't contain her excitement and spoke loudly in the lobby.

Soon, whispers spread. Su Nantian simply acted normally, asking Wang Feixue beside him, "Which floor is the ward? You need to lead the way."

Wang Feixue had only been observing the nurses' whispers but hadn't realized Su Nantian didn't know about the ward. After Su Nantian reminded her, she lightly smacked her forehead and let Su Nantian hold her as they turned to the left elevator on the first floor.

Wang Feixue pressed the elevator button. Su Nantian stood behind her, his tall body shielding her completely. From behind, it looked like only Su Nantian was standing there.

Wang Feixue enjoyed being protected by Su Nantian. She hadn't felt safety for years, but after meeting Su Nantian today, her emotions had recovered much.

The elevator quickly opened in front of them. Su Nantian held Wang Feixue and entered the elevator. The door closed gradually under the lingering gazes of the nurses.

Inside the elevator, only two people remained. Wang Feixue pressed the button for the seventh floor and stood politely aside, like a company elevator attendant. Su Nantian smiled and bent down to kiss her face.

"What are you doing..." Wang Feixue was startled. Her dewy eyes searched for the camera corners in the elevator.

Indeed, Wang Feixue saw a faint red light blinking at the top left. Her face was redder than the red light.

"They've recorded it. You're a public figure, aren't you afraid of exposure?" Wang Feixue leaned against Su Nantian's chest and pressed her back against the cold elevator wall.

Su Nantian held Wang Feixue's hand and pulled her closer. His warm palm covered Wang Feixue's cold back, giving her a gentle feeling that made her snuggle closer to Su Nantian.

"Don't worry. There's nothing to fear," Su Nantian said calmly. Though it was the truth, his slightly arrogant tone made Wang Feixue stunned. She realized that she had teased Su Nantian so many times today, and in his tolerance, she had forgotten that Su Nantian was someone who even Wang Feisi had to grovel for.

"Beep." The elevator arrived at the seventh floor. After exiting, Su Nantian's eyes searched around. Upon seeing the bright light sign, he said to Wang Feixue beside him, "You go to the ward first and tell me which room it is. I'll go to the restroom."

"Okay, it's Room 709. You go first," Wang Feixue nodded obediently.

They immediately separated left and right. Wang Feixue went toward the ward.

Wang Feixue easily reached Room 709. The hospital wards all had white doors with a long transparent glass window, allowing people outside to see the patients inside. Correspondingly, there was a curtain on the glass.

If you didn't want to be seen inside, the curtain would be drawn.

So when Wang Feixue saw that the window wasn't covered by a curtain, her eyebrows furrowed slightly. Her eyes showed some confusion.

Possibly because it was night and no one was around, the corridor was empty. The ward door had a gap and wasn't fully closed.

Wang Feixue placed her hand on the doorknob. She was about to open it when she heard a woman's voice shouting inside, followed by the sound of something heavy hitting the ground.

Wang Feixue's hand to open the door gradually withdrew. She looked at the sign on the ward door "709" again, confirming it was correct.

The sound from inside grew louder. A woman's voice could be heard shouting, "Hey, eat! Look at your appearance, can't even open your mouth! You're so slow!"

Then there was a sound of bowls and spoons colliding. Wang Feixue finally understood that some nurses were feeding her grandfather. But this attitude made her unable to stay calm.

She forcefully pushed the door open, startling the nurse who was angry and looking at Wang Feixue. Upon seeing it was Wang Feixue, the nurse's gaze flickered strangely before returning to a neutral expression. She continued to scoop soup into the bowl, trying to feed it to her grandfather who was watching his granddaughter.

"Come on, Grandpa Wang. Open your mouth and eat," the nurse said coldly, her movements rigid as she prodded it toward the old man.

Wang Feixue's anger flared. She shouted, "Don't act like this! I heard everything you did to my grandfather outside!"

The hospital was quiet at night, so Wang Feixue's voice echoed through the corridor. Su Nantian in the restroom heard it clearly.

Suspecting something, Su Nantian casually blew two times and walked toward Room 709 as Wang Feixue had said.

In the ward, Grandpa Wang was trying to stretch his hand toward Wang Feixue. But his movements were extremely slow, and his mouth opened and closed repeatedly but he couldn't speak. Wang Feixue felt deep pain in her heart. She quickly took a step forward and held Grandpa Wang's hand.

"Grandpa..." Wang Feixue's voice carried a hint of guilt. Grandpa Wang, though his physical condition was lagging, still understood what Wang Feixue felt guilty about.

Chapter 247: A Slap

Wang Feixue was guilty for not providing the best treatment conditions for her grandfather. She also felt guilty for not visiting him for so long, letting him endure such a big injustice.

Grandpa Wang's other hand also covered hers, patting it comfortingly.

Wang Feixue's originally dewy eyes quickly became misted with tears, looking particularly pitiable. But the nurse saw Wang Feixue's delicate beauty and felt even more anger. She slammed the bowl and chopsticks aside, preparing to leave.

"Stop!" Wang Feixue shouted. "You must apologize to my grandfather!"

"Apologize?" The nurse asked with a laugh, turning to Wang Feixue and smiling. "Did I hear that right? Let me apologize? Do you know where this is?"

"You've wasted so much treatment time because your grandfather is in this ward. I think you haven't visited him for days. I'm doing this out of kindness to feed your grandfather, and you're acting like this. Haha, dog bites Lü Dongbin!"

Wang Feixue's face turned pale and red. The nurse, seeing Wang Feixue so angry, became even more triumphant. "I think you might not be able to afford this ordinary ward in a few days. Just pack up and leave early."

The nurse's gaze circled Wang Feixue's pale face, mocking her. "What's the use of being pretty? You always wear cheap clothes. A poor girl dares to make me apologize, I spit!"

The nurse spat heavily toward Wang Feixue and turned to leave with a triumphant expression, completely ignoring Wang Feixue's face about to cry.

Wang Feixue was furious. Seeing the nurse about to leave, she grabbed the nurse's sleeve and said, "Stop! You must apologize to my grandfather! You did something inappropriate. You must apologize!"
