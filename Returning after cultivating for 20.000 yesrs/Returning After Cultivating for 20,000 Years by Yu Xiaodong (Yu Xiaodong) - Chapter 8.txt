Su Nantian bent down to retrieve a usable baseball bat. He did not wish to soil his feet, let alone use his hands.

With a single motion, he swung the bat without hesitation, bringing it down directly under Xu Tian's horrified gaze.

Ahh~!

A heart-wrenching scream echoed through the entire private room, deafening. The sound of the bat striking, the cracking of bones, and the delicate snap of a penis were all drowned out.

Everyone's lower bodies went cold, instinctively clenching their legs. Their gazes toward Su Nantian were filled with fear.

Even Wang Chengli's second brother, who had been perched atop Xiao Hui's buttocks, instantly wilted.

Because Su Nantian's gaze had fallen upon him. Cold and icy, like being stared down by a wild beast.

"This is the fate of those who dare to scheme against my woman."

Magnificent and unyielding!

If Lin Suyun had heard these words, she would have been overjoyed.

Boom!

"Big Brother, mercy! This woman is yours. I won't touch the other one either. Everything belongs to you, Big Brother. All of this was ordered by Chen Shao. It's all Chen Shao's doing."

Wang Chengli immediately pushed Xiao Hui off him and fell to his knees, confessing everything.

"Chen Yulin? Where is he?"

Su Nantian furrowed his brow. Indeed, a nest of rats.

"No need to look. I'm here. Truly, you're all useless. I can't fathom how you attained this position."

Chen Yulin stepped through the door, cigarette in his mouth, sneering at Su Nantian.

Following Chen Yulin emerged a middle-aged man, his presence shrouded in a black coat, exuding an aura of mystery. It was evident he was no ordinary man.

"This is Zhao Sen, a retired special forces soldier. He also holds another role as an honorary guest scholar of the Chen family. Last time, you forced me into a humiliating retreat. Today, let's see if you can endure the same humiliation."

Chen Yulin said with a smug grin.

"Little did I know it was you. That's why Xu Tian had such confidence. Perhaps I shouldn't have let you go last time."

Su Nantian's eyes flashed with coldness, dismissing Zhao Sen entirely.

"Su Nantian, don't be so smug. I know your strength is great, breaking a car with one hand is impressive. But it's not an assassination technique. This man once eliminated hundreds of enemies in the border region with only a few men, moving through gunfire. What good is your strength?"

Su Nantian sneered and kicked Wang Chengli away.

"You can still move around now. Wait until I break your legs and feet, then see if you'll dare to bounce in front of me."

After speaking, Chen Yulin glanced at his guest scholar.

Zhao Sen removed the mysterious black coat, revealing a body of hardened muscles and terrifying scars. His chest bore a ten-centimeter-long knife scar, truly horrifying. With a slight movement, his tanned skin revealed bulging veins like earthworms across his body. His presence alone was enough to instill a sense of helplessness, and if it had been Wang Chengli's men, they would have dared not approach.

Defying Chen Shao meant death. Give it your all.

Cold and raspy, the words came from Zhao Sen's mouth. It sounded like a machine. If not for his muscles and terrifying scars, one might think he was a robot.

Suddenly, Zhao Sen lunged forward like a human beast. His speed left only a blur. The short distance was closed, his sandbag-sized fist inches from Su Nantian's forehead.

Su Nantian remained still, standing there.

Is he stunned? He doesn't even move.

Zhao Sen's lips curled into a sneer.

But in the next moment, his hand was seized by an irresistible force. He could not break free; his forward momentum halted instantly, and he was lifted into the air, spinning uncontrollably.

A moment later, a massive force struck his abdomen, and he was launched away.

Ahh! Ahh!

Two cries of pain echoed as Zhao Sen, kicked by Su Nantian, collided with Chen Yulin.

Both stared at Su Nantian in terror.

Zhao Sen's mind was even more shaken. The feeling of being kicked away without a chance to fight had only been experienced ten years ago with Long Badian. How could this youth possess such power?

Could he be an immortal cultivator? Impossible, but the sensation of their fight made it impossible to deny.

Regardless of whether he was or not, Zhao Sen could not confront him. Nor could the Chen family. He understood the danger of such a person, having witnessed their terrifying power during that border battle. Without Long Badian's support, he would have never survived to this day.

"Su Nantian, I admit you're impressive. Unexpectedly so. But don't be too smug. Look at this."

Chen Yulin had not even seen Zhao Sen's defeat, as he returned immediately after his charge.

Yet he did not believe Su Nantian could harm him, for Lin Suyun was in his grasp.

"Another trick. It seems you're really seeking death."

Su Nantian's gaze sharpened as he saw the photo in Chen Yulin's hand: Lin Suyun lying on a bed, unconscious.

"Want to kill me? Try it. I'll make your little beauty's life a living hell. Ha! Scared..."

Chen Yulin sneered, confident Su Nantian would not harm him.

Su Nantian said nothing. His gaze was as cold and deep as an icy well. He kicked Chen Yulin in the chest.

"You..."

Chen Yulin's ribs caved inward, coughing up a torrent of blood. His expression was filled with disbelief. He could not believe Su Nantian would strike him, for Lin Suyun was in his grasp. How could that cold woman bring a stranger home?

Impossible!

" I have a hundred ways to kill you. Pray Lin Suyun is unharmed, or the Chen family will vanish tonight."

Su Nantian spoke coldly.

"Ha! You don't know the Chen family's status in Feng City. They are one of the four major families. To say they hold power is no exaggeration. You, a small fry, have no right to even gaze upon them. A single finger could crush you. If I die tonight, you won't survive it either."

Chen Yulin gritted his teeth against the pain in his chest, struggling to speak. "You don't know what you're dealing with. I've seen the Chen family's might."

He did not believe Su Nantian would be afraid of death.

"Truly laughable. Do you think bringing the whole family here will scare me? To me, they're all ants. How dare they touch my people?"

Su Nantian sneered.

Back then, when his title of Immortal Lord was announced, who didn't flee?

He stomped on Chen Yulin's fingers.

A scream echoed. Chen Yulin could not believe it. Even after hearing of the Feng City Chen family, Su Nantian remained so calm. He even dared to strike him, threatening to kill the entire Chen family. Did he truly not fear death? A madman, a complete madman. The thought of Su Nantian possibly killing him made him panic.

At this moment, he was truly frightened. He had just begun his life; to die at the hands of a madman was unbearable. So much wealth remained unspent, so much beauty left to enjoy.

"Quickly, Zhao Sen. Call and release the woman."

Chen Yulin cried out in fear, for Su Nantian's gaze had become more terrifying than ever. It felt like death itself was descending upon him.

Zhao Sen immediately pulled out his phone and dialed a number.

"Now, quickly bring the woman to Hat Club. If even one hair is missing, you'll pay with your lives."

Feeling the previous aura, Zhao Sen had no doubt. This was an immortal cultivator. Only such a person could possess such power, truly a presence of intimidation.

He now had no doubt that the Chen family's annihilation was not an empty threat.

"You just said how mighty your family is. Now you're afraid? Want to live? I'd like to see the Chen family's might now. Call."

Su Nantian sneered.

Chen Yulin did not move. He didn't know if Su Nantian was testing him or truly fearless. He feared that before the call was made, he would already be dead.

"You're really useless. Now you dare not call, yet you use such underhanded methods."

"Did I need to dial the number for you?"

Su Nantian handed over the phone, but Chen Yulin's trembling hands never had the courage to take it. Zhao Sen grabbed the phone instead.

He knew this might be the Chen family's last chance.

After a few whispered words, he hung up quickly.

Chen Yulin looked at Su Nantian with resentment. How dare you be so arrogant? Wait until my father arrives and teaches you a lesson.

Su Nantian took back the phone, then walked to the nearby chair and sat down without even glancing at the trembling Chen Yulin.

"Zhang Mu, this world is like that. It's about bullying the weak and fearing the strong. If you're not ruthless, they'll think you're easy prey and devour you completely."

Su Nantian looked at Zhang Mu, who was watching him with a strange expression, and said slowly.

Seeing his puzzled look, he patted Zhang Mu's shoulder again and added seriously:

"Rest assured, no one will ever bully you again."

As soon as he finished speaking, the door of the private room was opened.

"Master Chen, I've brought her. She's quite a beauty; I almost couldn't control myself."

The man wore a black suit and immediately spoke loudly upon entering.

He glanced around but did not see Master Chen. A composed man sat in a chair, and he asked: "Have you seen Master Chen?"

Su Nantian's gaze was cold. He did not speak, but looked at the woman being held by his back.

Seeing no one answered, he said: "Are you deaf? Didn't you hear me asking?"

Su Nantian stood up and, in an instant, was before the man. He punched him directly in the face.

Crash! The man fell to the ground.

When Wang Chengli and Xu Tian looked at the man's face again, they felt as if descending into hell. Their bodies broke out in cold sweat.

The man's face was twisted beyond recognition, his features merged into one. His brain matter burst out; it was no longer a face. Even the most skilled plastic surgeon could not piece it back together.

It was terrifying beyond measure, and they understood this man was dead. Dead through and through. This was Su Nantian's first kill, but it would not be the last.

The next could easily be them three. Possibly.

In an instant, the three's faces turned ashen. They no longer believed they would survive this night.

The two men holding Lin Suyun immediately fainted.

Su Nantian reached out and cradled Lin Suyun's body in his arms. His gaze held a rare tenderness, something he had never known in the immortal world.

He knew from now on, his heart would have a burden. He could no longer be completely cold and indifferent. Thus, he must become stronger—strong enough to ignore everything.

What did you do to him?

Su Nantian's gaze was cold as he looked at Chen Yulin.

"I... I didn't do anything. I haven't touched her yet. Here, I return her to you."

Chen Yulin stammered, not daring to look up. He feared that devilish gaze. His voice trembled.

Crack!

Shuffling...

Su Nantian stepped on his other hand. The white bones were exposed, but Su Nantian did not stop. He continued grinding against the floor until the bones turned to powder, and flesh had become mangled meat.

The entire private room echoed with Chen Yulin's screams.

These sounds, heard by Xu Tian and Wang Chengli, felt like a death call, terrifying beyond measure.

"Killing you would be too merciful."

Su Nantian's cold smile was like that of a true death god.

Chapter 34: Chen Tian Guo

"Want to live?"

Su Nantian suddenly asked Wang Chengli.

"Ahh, of course I want to live. Big Brother, what should I do? Even if it's climbing a mountain of knives or diving into fire, I won't blink."

Wang Chengli rushed toward Su Nantian upon hearing the word "live." His desire for survival was overwhelming.

Swish!

Wang Chengli's body immediately stopped. A knife was inserted into the table, slightly shaking. The blade was just a few centimeters from his head.

"Big Brother, don't kill me. I, Wang Chengli, will serve you as a cow or horse for your command."

"The knife isn't for you. Go, stab Chen Yulin ten times. Remember not to kill him."

A devilish voice echoed again.

Wang Chengli did not hesitate. He grabbed the knife and stabbed it into Chen Yulin's leg.

Chen Yulin was horrified. Ten times—even if he didn't die, he would be barely alive. He now prayed for his father's arrival to avenge him.

"Master Chen, I'm sorry."

Wang Chengli apologized and raised the gleaming knife.

Plop!

" Wang Chengli, you traitor. I'll give you money; how much do you want?"

Chen Yulin dodged, but his leg was pierced. He felt the pain and struggled.

But with his hands broken, he could not fight Wang Chengli. In desperation, he said:

"Master Chen, I'm sorry. Even if you give me more money, it can't save my life."

Wang Chengli did not hesitate. He clearly knew his life was in Su Nantian's hands. Even if Chen Yulin gave him more money, it was useless.

What use is money when one is about to die?

Ahh!

Another stab.

...

Chen Tian Guo hung up the phone, his face dark and gloomy.

Immortal cultivator!

How did Yulin get involved with an immortal cultivator?

Every immortal cultivator was of high status. Yulin had no chance to meet them.

Even he did not have the qualifications to know about them. His first understanding of immortal cultivators was from Zhao Sen, and he remembered clearly how Zhao Sen spoke about Long Badian with fear and admiration. That memory would never be forgotten.

If it was truly an immortal cultivator, then the Chen family might not survive. Yulin would certainly lose his life.

After attaining a high position, he had only occasionally heard of immortal cultivators. Their powers were unimaginable; their combat strength was immeasurable.

It was said that the downfall of the Su family a hundred years ago had something to do with immortal cultivators. This matter had never been clarified.

He did not have time to think further, for Zhao Sen was the Chen family's strongest. He knew his methods well.

If even he had failed, then no one could protect the Chen family.

He immediately called the housekeeper and instructed him on several matters before leaving hurriedly.

The housekeeper's face turned pale upon hearing the orders. Although he did not understand why the master had told him to have the mistress and others hide immediately, he did not ask. It must be something big.

As a housekeeper, one only needed to obey orders. Knowing too much was dangerous.

...

The seventh stab struck Chen Yulin again.

He had no strength left to scream. He had almost fainted several times, waiting for his father's arrival.

He knew if he fainted, he would never wake up. He wanted to see Su Nantian kneeling at his feet, begging for mercy.

Creak!

The private room door opened again. A tall man with a square face and steady gait entered.

"Father, save me."

Chen Yulin saw the man entering and momentarily forgot his pain. He shouted loudly.

Ahh!

Another stab.

Wang Chengli did not stop his actions upon seeing the man. The fear Su Nantian had instilled in him was etched into his bones.

Chen Tian Guo heard his son's desperate cries and did not stop. His face remained unchanged, and he did not even glance at Chen Yulin lying on the ground.

His eyes were only for the young man in the center of the room—the one who would decide the Chen family's fate.

Chen Yulin was now completely desperate. His long-awaited father had arrived, alone. But he did not even glance at him.

The hope that had just risen was extinguished again.

"Immortal cultivator, my son did not know your identity. He has offended you greatly. I, Chen, now apologize to the immortal cultivator."

After saying this, he immediately knelt.

Chen Yulin saw this and, with the tenth stab falling, fainted. His father had knelt! Then his life was no longer worth saving.

Xu Tian and Wang Chengli were shocked. They had never imagined Chen Tian Guo would kneel, something no one would believe.

Zhang Mu felt this was all too surreal. The chairman of the Wan Hua Group, with a fortune in hundreds of billions and industries spanning most of Feng City, had knelt before Su Nantian.

The three men felt the same question: "Immortal cultivator? What is that?"

"You're quite smart. Indeed, you've lived long enough to be a fox."

Su Nantian sneered and continued.

"To let me spare the Chen family, it's easy. Chen Yulin must die, and he must die at your hands.

You know what to do with these people on the ground."

"Thank you, immortal cultivator. Spare the Chen family a life."

Chen Tian Guo heard this and immediately shook his head, saying hurriedly. He feared speaking too late would lose the opportunity.

Zhang Mu felt a chill in his heart. These people would die, and after hesitating, he said: "Nantian, they were all classmates before. Can you let them off this time?"

"Nantian, your humanity is too much. Well, I'll let them go this time. But this matter can't be left at that."

After saying this, he looked at Chen Tian Guo.

"You don't need to teach me."

Chen Tian Guo immediately shook his head. His heart was also shocked at Zhang Mu, wondering if this man was also an immortal cultivator.

Chen Tian Guo then turned to Chen Yulin, took the knife inserted in his body, and ended his life.

Wang Chengli looked at Chen Tian Guo holding the knife, then at Su Nantian. He swallowed hard.

"Let him live a dog's life. I don't want anyone to know about this tonight."

Su Nantian was satisfied with Chen Tian Guo's decisiveness. If he had hesitated, Su Nantian might have changed his mind.

Chen Tian Guo himself did not know that this action had saved him once.

After saying this, he turned and left. Zhang Mu also followed behind with some trepidation.

Chapter 35: The Unscrupulous Driver

After leaving the Hat Club, Su Nantian held Lin Suyun and stood on the roadside for a moment.

He realized he had no car.

No car.

He looked back at Zhang Mu.

Zhang Mu immediately understood Su Nantian's meaning and scratched his head awkwardly.

Su Nantian was surprised. How could Zhang Mu, who had taken on a project, not even have a car?

He must have encountered some trouble.

"Don't worry. Everything will be fine. Exchange numbers, and we can have a meal together later to chat."

Su Nantian smiled.

After exchanging numbers, Zhang Mu hailed a taxi and let Su Nantian get in first.

Watching their retreating figures, Zhang Mu felt a wave of emotion.

Thinking about Su Nantian's smile just now, it was impossible to connect it with the killer he had seen.

Everyone had changed a lot. But Su Nantian was still his old good friend.

"Hey, buddy, where are you going? Seems like you had a big catch tonight!"

The driver saw Su Nantian holding a beautiful woman and teased.

Su Nantian was momentarily stunned. He knew the way, but he didn't know what it was called.

He couldn't guide the driver all the way.

"This is your first time, right? You're shy to speak up. There's a luxurious and high-end hotel nearby. I'll take you there."

The driver saw Su Nantian didn't answer and immediately knew. From the club, holding a beautiful woman—this was a well-known place.

Seeing Su Nantian didn't speak, he assumed it was okay.

"Hey, buddy. You're a newbie. I've got some treasures."

He threw something behind.

Su Nantian glanced at it!

Shocked~!

Dulles Supreme Invincible Ultra-Thin Condom, only 0.01mm.

A feeling like flying.

"I'm impressed. Your business is really broad."

Su Nantian didn't express amazement, but this was truly an old driver. His face had a slight flush.

In the immortal world, he hadn't encountered such things. Plus, he was still a virgin.

"This is the genuine article. Such thin ones are hard to buy. Young man, safety is most important. Whether for yourself or others."

After saying this, the driver was about to throw another one.

Su Nantian immediately stopped him because he saw it:

Lubricant!

So...

This was truly without limits.

He wanted to say the driver had no integrity, but he held back. He feared this old driver would drive too fast and crash.

The driver instantly understood, smiled, thinking he still couldn't let go.

Soon the car stopped.

Su Nantian quickly threw two bills and immediately carried Lin Suyun out of the car.

"Hey, buddy. I'll return your change!"

Su Nantian was about to say it wasn't needed when something fell on Lin Suyun.

Dulles Supreme Invincible Ultra-Thin Condom.

But when Su Nantian looked up, the car had already driven away.

This speed was too fast.

The old driver truly lived up to his name.

Su Nantian shook his head in无奈 and entered the hotel.

"A double room."

After saying this, he was about to put down Lin Suyun and get the money.

"Sir, sorry. The regular double room is full. Only a presidential suite remains."

"Really? Such a big hotel... then the presidential suite it is."

Su Nantian wasn't short of money, but he was curious why such a big hotel would have no rooms.

Su Nantian didn't know that the taxi driver received a commission for bringing customers here.

"Wait, we want that room."

A small-eyed man shouted loudly.

He was also holding a seductive woman.

"Hey, I didn't expect it to be you. Seems like we really have a grudge."

The small-eyed man saw Su Nantian and was excited. He had been looking for Su Nantian.

This man wasn't anyone else but Wang Yanbing, the general manager of Haolin Real Estate, who had met Su Nantian in Fan Zhesi's store that afternoon.

"Again you, I didn't expect you to play this game. Last time you failed to steal clothes, now you're stealing rooms. Did you know the manager again?"

Su Nantian looked at him disdainfully, changed his mask and thought himself a person of importance.

"Hey, you're right. I do know the manager here."

Wang Yanbing looked at Su Nantian smugly and turned to the receptionist, saying: "Don't you dare call the manager for me?"

Wang Yanbing hadn't expected to meet the man who had made him urinate in fear. It was truly a blessing from heaven.

"Then let's see."

Su Nantian didn't worry at all, for he had just realized this hotel was part of the Lin family's assets.

He looked at Wang Yanbing with a playful gaze.

Su Nantian didn't rush. He walked to the side and placed Lin Suyun on the sofa.

Unexpectedly, the box of ultra-thin condoms fell to the ground.

"Ha! It's Dulles. I'm dying laughing. You even bought a fake."

Wang Yanbing narrowed his eyes, almost closing them. Seeing the item on the ground, he became excited.

"Who's this country bumpkin? He doesn't even know that five-star hotels come with this. You bought a fake. Now who still uses this? You even want to stay in the presidential suite."

The seductive woman took the opportunity to mock.

"Unexpectedly, you don't use it either. That's why you've caught so many diseases."

Su Nantian looked at the woman, and he immediately knew she had a disease. It was an infectious one—either AIDS or syphilis.

"Who do you think has a disease? You have it."

The seductive woman was shocked, her face changed. She was angry. How did he know she had a disease? She hadn't even gained any benefits yet.

"Ha."

Su Nantian smiled and said nothing, putting the Dulles into his pocket. He looked at Wang Yanbing with a slight pity.

"Manager, this gentleman."

"Mr. Wang, it's been a while."

The manager saw Mr. Wang and immediately approached with enthusiasm.

They chatted for a while, completely ignoring Su Nantian.

...

"Manager, I'll go up first."

Wang Yanbing glanced at Su Nantian.

"Quickly take Mr. Wang up."

Mo Yu said directly, not asking Su Nantian.

"Wait a second."

Su Nantian spoke coldly.

"Oh, sir. Sorry, our hotel is full."

Mo Yu pretended to just see Su Nantian and smiled.

He had thought this kid would leave on his own without explanation.

But he hadn't expected such an impudent person.

" I arrived first, why give it to him?"

Su Nantian sat on the sofa with his legs crossed and said.

"Since you're so curious, I'll tell you. This gentleman is a member here. In this situation, members are prioritized."

Mo Yu tried to control his temper. He disliked Su Nantian's tone and manner.

Most of the hotel members he knew, he had never seen this kid.

Member priority was a temporary idea. He didn't believe this kid was a member.

Chapter 36: The Evil Condom

"Kid, you've never seen one before. Look carefully, don't let your dog eyes be dazzled."

Wang Yanbing pulled out an LV wallet and searched for a while before taking out a card, waving it in front of Su Nantian.

"This has the special mark. It's not just a regular membership card. And this kind of membership card isn't something you can get with money. How could you have it?"

Wang Yanbing saw Su Nantian's expression as if he had never seen the world before, with a glint in his eyes.

He was more certain this was just a country bumpkin who had gotten lucky and was being taken care of.

Looking at Lin Suyun lying on the sofa, looking seductive and tempting, he felt a twinge of jealousy.

Su Nantian looked at the special mark. His expression was strange. It was none other than a Mandrake flower, which he remembered the Lin family had given him a golden card with such a mark.

It seemed the old man was truly devoted to this woman.

Su Nantian smiled and took out several cards from his pocket. He found the golden credit card.

"Without even a wallet, you're learning to stay in hotels. Truly embarrassing."

The seductive woman looked at Su Nantian with disdain.

Her gaze was full of resentment, as if everyone had known about her disease.

"Golden card. It's really rare. Did you make it yourself?"

Wang Yanbing laughed as if he had no eyes. He had never seen anyone use a golden membership card.

Mo Yu saw the golden credit card and was surprised. After all, golden credit cards were rare. They were usually specially customized by big companies or groups.

How could this kid be...

The next moment.

Mo Yu widened his eyes, held his breath, and his heart raced.

He carefully looked at the mark on the front of the card. He would not make a mistake, absolutely not.

The Lin family's special mark—Mandrake flower.

Golden!

In ten years of working at the hotel, he had never seen it.

Golden!

"Manager Mo, this kid is using a fake card, right?"

Wang Yanbing saw Mo Yu staring and was suspicious.

"Call the general manager."

Hearing Su Nantian's cold voice, Mo Yu was like waking up from a dream. He regained his senses and broke out in cold sweat.

"Sir, I'm truly sorry. Forgive my mistake. I'll check you in immediately."

Mo Yu quickly bowed and apologized, not taking the card from Su Nantian's hand or calling the general manager.

If the general manager came, he might have to pack his things and leave.

So his bent back never rose.

Wang Yanbing tried to widen his small eyes again.

What now!

He immediately walked over and took the card from Su Nantian's hand.

"Made it so well, even this mark is made to be real. But I've never heard of a golden one."

Wang Yanbing sneered and said, "You can even fake it. The skill of making fake IDs is good! But the color was wrong."

He threw the card back at Su Nantian and helped Mo Yu straighten his bent back.

"Manager Mo, you shouldn't apologize to a fake ID maker."

"Wang Mr., I've never seen this card. But it's definitely real."

Mo Yu explained. These two were not people he could afford to offend. Although Wang Yanbing was just the general manager of real estate, his background was strong.

"Since you don't want to call the general manager over, then cancel his membership."

Su Nantian spoke again, his voice still cold.

He didn't urge Mo Yu but just watched silently.

But the more so, the more Mo Yu panicked.

Could this be someone sent to inspect?

Mo Yu had various guesses in his heart, but no matter who it was, he couldn't afford to offend.

Compared with this mysterious person who could make him leave in one sentence, he preferred to offend Wang Yanbing.

Soon, he made a decision.

"Ha! You think you're the boss of Lin Group? You can fire anyone you want. Playing daytime tricks again. If it weren't for the woman by your side, you wouldn't be so arrogant. A fake ID maker is really bold."

Wang Yanbing laughed as if it were a joke.

"Mr. Wang, I'm sorry."

"Hah..."

Wang Yanbing was about to laugh when Mo Yu's words almost made him choke. He looked at Mo Yu in disbelief.

Mo Yu turned to Wang Yanbing and apologized, not listening to his confusion.

He walked to the front desk, took Wang Yanbing's membership card, and logged into the manager's management platform. Without hesitation, he canceled the membership account.

Wang Yanbing was stunned.

"Mr. Wang, there's fifty thousand left on your card. I'll replenish it later."

"Good, Mo Yu." Wang Yanbing said angrily.

"And you too, fake ID maker."

After saying that, he turned around and left with the seductive woman.

"Sir, please follow me."

Mo Yu walked beside Su Nantian and said respectfully.

The three of them entered the elevator and quickly reached the top floor's presidential suite.

"Sir, is there anything else you need?"

"No, go down."

Su Nantian immediately carried Lin Suyun into the room.

Mo Yu sighed and wiped his forehead. He quickly pulled out his phone to call the general manager about the golden card.

The general manager was also shocked. Even he had only heard of it and never seen it before, immediately rushing back.

Su Nantian knew Lin Suyun was fine, just frightened and unconscious. To prevent her from seeing the bloody scenes, he didn't wake her up.

As soon as he placed her on the bed, Lin Suyun slowly opened her eyes.

A man!

Ahh!

She immediately reached for her clothes. They were still there.

After seeing the person's face, she took deep breaths.

"South Heaven, it's really you."

She hugged Su Nantian tightly.

"Rest assured. Chen Yulin will never bother you again."

Feeling the fresh scent around his nose and the soft, boneless body in his arms, he felt a surge of emotion.

He was about to savor it more when Lin Suyun pushed him away.

"Pervert!"
