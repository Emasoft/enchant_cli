"Indeed, there was no alternative. After all, your alliance only has this inland port as a stronghold, making it even harder for the Nan Gong family to gain profit from here. Moreover, you took all the financial reports and no one revealed anything, so we had no choice but to resort to this strategy. However, I have another matter to discuss with you today—please consider it carefully."

Su Nantian spoke with a grin, preparing to steer the conversation toward his true purpose.

Li Zhe cast a sidelong glance at Su Nantian before continuing, "Then what is it that you came to see me about? And why did you come here openly at the inland port? I suspect you're trying to confirm our cooperation with others. This will only make people believe that this act was done by me, and they'll still think I betrayed them. This stigma will linger for a long time."

Li Zhe was now extremely cautious, yet he only focused on the negative aspects, never considering what Su Nantian had truly come to say.

Chapter 591: Negotiations

Su Nantian could sense Li Zhe's intense hostility toward him, still believing he had come to harm him. Thus, Su Nantian smiled and said, "I have something important to discuss with you today. However, if you continue like this, I doubt we can reach an agreement. Therefore, I advise you to set aside your prejudices and approach me with a calm mindset."

After hearing Su Nantian's words, Li Zhe was somewhat puzzled. He knew Su Nantian wouldn't have come without reason. Moreover, Li Zhe's previous words had some impulsive elements; after all, Su Nantian didn't need to do this to harm him. Li Zhe noticed that Su Nantian's demeanor suggested he truly had something important to discuss.

Thus, Li Zhe sighed and looked up at Su Nantian before finally saying, "What exactly did you come here for? We've had no prior interactions. Why now, when you approach me with something to discuss? How can I maintain a calm mindset toward you? You must know that something has happened recently. I believe you are the mastermind behind this."

Li Zhe had already concluded that the false accusation against him was definitely connected to the Nan Gong family. After leaking data to them and then turning the blame onto himself, this situation was clearly complicated.

Upon hearing Li Zhe's words, Su Nantian chuckled and shook his head. "You're too naive. In the adult world, there are no eternal friends or enemies—everyone prioritizes interests. As long as there's profit, cooperation is possible."

Su Nantian found Li Zhe's words overly simplistic and responded accordingly.

"You!" Li Zhe, upon hearing Su Nantian's remarks, was somewhat angry but only managed to utter one word before falling silent. Because Li Zhe realized Su Nantian was right—among people like them, there were no eternal friends or enemies.

Didn't he himself once stand against Wang Bo? Yet this time, to counter the Nan Gong family, they had temporarily formed an alliance under Zhang Yuan's guidance.

"You came here today—what exactly do you want? Just speak plainly. If your intention was to scold me, I can only ask you to leave first."

Li Zhe felt Su Nantian's hesitation was irritating, so he made this dismissive remark.

"Originally, I wanted to exchange pleasantries first, but you're so eager. Then, let me state my purpose now. Actually, I came here to ask if you wanted to cooperate with the Nan Gong family. After all, your current situation must not be easy either. Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo have already expelled you from the alliance, leaving you alone now. Will your days ahead be easy at the inland port?"

After saying this, Su Nantian smiled and stared at Li Zhe, waiting for his response.

Li Zhe's mention of being framed stirred up his anger again. He then said angrily to Su Nantian, "Isn't it because of your Nan Gong family that I was framed? If it weren't for your Nan Gong family, would I have been expelled from the alliance by them? Now everyone believes that I leaked the financial reports to your Nan Gong family. You found an insider within these reports, but you framed me instead. Now you're coming to see me—do you think I'll give you a good face?"

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian shook his head again. It seemed Li Zhe couldn't get over this obstacle, but Su Nantian also felt that if he were in Li Zhe's position, he would be equally resentful. After all, regardless of the alliance issue, Li Zhe was now framed—this feeling was indeed quite委屈.

However, after saying this, Li Zhe realized his emotions were too intense. He calmed himself down and said to Su Nantian, "Speak up—what exactly did you come here for? What can I cooperate with your Nan Gong family on?"

Indeed, Su Nantian's previous words had touched Li Zhe. After all, Su Nantian was absolutely right—there were no eternal enemies or friends in this world. As long as there was a connection of interests, they could stand on the same side.

"Since you've already been expelled from the alliance, you're no longer under Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo's approval. Although you aren't outright enemies, some things at the inland port will definitely be biased against you. Why not cooperate with us Nan Gong family? For the next year, we plan to control the entire inland port. You can use this year to expand your influence at the inland port. However, you also know that the Nan Gong family's current situation in the inland port is difficult—there are several local bosses controlling many things, which makes it challenging for us."

After saying this, Su Nantian stared intently at Li Zhe to observe his reaction.

"Since you've already said that the three of us local bosses make it difficult for your Nan Gong family to achieve what you want, why should I still cooperate with you? As long as I don't break ties with Wang Bo and Zhang Yuan, the three of us can still make your Nan Gong family suffer here."

After hearing Su Nantian's words, Li Zhe responded like this. However, deep down he was slightly tempted. He lacked a force to stand alongside now. He understood that among the inland port's forces, he was the weakest. If Zhang Yuan or Wang Bo wanted to target him, it would be a big problem.

But Su Nantian's words had no threat to him. He smiled and continued, "I said it was difficult for the Nan Gong family, but not impossible. Like this data issue—wasn't it eventually resolved? Moreover, this time we Nan Gong family didn't take the blame. However, if you do cooperate with us, it will definitely make things easier for us Nan Gong family. We can also guarantee that you'll receive your rightful share of the profits."

This was actually Su Nantian's leverage. After all, for anyone, what they wanted was ultimately profit.

Li Zhe was no longer part of the alliance, so he had to act alone. However, their forces weren't particularly strong—some people might even switch sides eventually, since internal personnel turnover was frequent at the inland port.

Therefore, Li Zhe's current situation wasn't good at all.

Chapter 592: Preparing for Two Scenarios

When it came to the benefits of profit, Li Zhe was indeed swayed. He asked, "If I could cooperate with your Nan Gong family, what conditions would you promise me?"

"If we follow the previous customs of the inland port, each of you received a share in the profits. However, if we Nan Gong family take the lead now, let Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo each receive one share, while you alone get two. How does that sound?"

Su Nantian directly revealed the conditions they had planned, which would be a huge temptation for Li Zhe. He didn't believe Li Zhe wouldn't be tempted.

Indeed, after hearing these words, Li Zhe slightly raised his eyebrows. Although he didn't show extreme excitement on the surface, it was clear that he had already wavered.

Su Nantian believed this condition was already very good and there was no room for negotiation. What remained now was whether Li Zhe would accept it or not. After all, the Nan Gong family's conditions were already laid out.

After Li Zhe thought for a few minutes, Su Nantian spoke again: "Well? This is the condition we offer you. And this year, it's neither long nor short. With the Nan Gong family's protection, you can develop your forces here. However, what remains is up to you. Whether you're a fool or a genius depends on this year. If you lack confidence in yourself, naturally, there's no need to cooperate with the Nan Gong family. After all, the Nan Gong family can withdraw at any time, but you Li Zhe will still have to struggle here."

Although Su Nantian's words seemed indifferent toward Li Zhe's decision, he was actually using a provocation tactic.

If Su Nantian hadn't said these words, Li Zhe might have doubted himself. Within a year, with the Nan Gong family's protection, it was as Su Nantian said—after they withdrew, if Li Zhe hadn't developed his forces, he would face deeper retaliation from Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo.

Therefore, if Li Zhe couldn't use this opportunity to expand his forces within a year, then after the Nan Gong family left, his hell would begin. However, if Li Zhe refused to cooperate with Su Nantian's group, it would be equivalent to admitting he was a fool and achieved nothing in this year.

At that moment, Li Zhe couldn't help but tightly grip his fists. He didn't believe he was a fool, and he felt that within this year, if he could cooperate with the Nan Gong family properly, he would definitely change his current situation.

Li Zhe now seemed to have burned his boats because, in his view, among the three so-called local bosses at the inland port, his strength was the weakest. If he could seize this opportunity to develop his forces, it would be the best.

Moreover, Li Zhe didn't want to think about failure. Why should he think about the consequences of failure? He believed that if he could cooperate with the Nan Gong family, success was inevitable. Failure didn't exist for him.

It was Su Nantian's words that ignited Li Zhe's fighting spirit. He nodded and said seriously, "Alright, if what you said is indeed true and you've agreed to this condition, I'm willing to cooperate with you."

Upon hearing these words, Su Nantian was secretly pleased but didn't show excessive joy on the surface. He only nodded and said, "You'll believe that you've made a correct judgment by cooperating with the Nan Gong family. It's beneficial for you in every way. Next, when you and the Nan Gong family join forces at the inland port, we'll be invincible."

After saying this, Su Nantian stood up and said, "Alright, since the matter has been settled, I'll go back to report to my superiors. Hope you remember what you said today. If you've agreed to the alliance, I hope you won't go back on your word."

After all, Li Zhe was still in an uncontrollable range. Therefore, Su Nantian also had some concerns that Li Zhe might regret after he left. Hence, he said these words to intimidate him.

Li Zhe nodded and said, "You can rest assured. I won't regret it. Since I've agreed to cooperate with the Nan Gong family, it represents my determination to burn my boats. As you said, if I don't develop within a year, after the Nan Gong family withdraws, I'll have no place to stand at the inland port and may even face a fatal strike from Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo.

Therefore, since I've had the courage to agree with you, it means I won't look back. Moreover, when you came, weren't you already prepared for this? You walked in so openly that people would think you were conspiring with me again. When you leave, it will definitely be a grand display for everyone to see. Even if I don't cooperate with your Nan Gong family, people will think we've formed an alliance. In any case, Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo have already seen me as a thorn in their side and won't work with me anymore."

At this moment, Li Zhe had seen through it clearly—his thoughts were completely understood by Su Nantian.

Actually, when Su Nantian came, he had already made a second plan. If Li Zhe could follow his plan and cooperate with the Nan Gong family, it would be ideal. However, if Li Zhe didn't cooperate with the Nan Gong family, his bold entrance and exit would have already been seen by countless people.

These people included not only Li Zhe's people but also Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo's. They would suspect that after they expelled Li Zhe from the alliance, he had already started to openly communicate with Su Nantian. Therefore, no matter what, at this moment, regardless of whether Li Zhe cooperated with the Nan Gong family or not, Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo would already see him as a member of the Nan Gong family.

Therefore, from the beginning, Su Nantian had already planned it out. Even if Li Zhe didn't agree to his plan, he would have made him a target of suspicion.

"Ha ha, I didn't expect you to see through it so clearly. However, now this strategy seems to have no use anymore because if you've already agreed to cooperate with the Nan Gong family, then for me, we are friends. Naturally, I won't use these methods to harm you," Su Nantian said with a grin.

Chapter 593: A Visitor

Just as Su Nantian and Li Zhe had reached an agreement, Su Nantian was about to leave when Li Zhe suddenly said, "By the way, there's one more thing I want to ask you."

Upon hearing Li Zhe say this, Su Nantian was also somewhat curious about what Li Zhe wanted to get from him. He nodded and said, "Ask me whatever you want. If I know it, I'll tell you."

"What exactly was the person who leaked our data to you? Was this person also cooperating with you?"

Upon hearing Li Zhe's question, Su Nantian chuckled. It seemed this issue was still a thorn in Li Zhe's heart. However, Li Zhe had already lost his trust in the Nan Gong family now; otherwise, he wouldn't have agreed to cooperate with them.

Su Nantian nodded and said, "Since we are now partners, I can tell you the truth. Yes, it was one of the three of you who handed over this information to us. That person is Wang Bo. However, it was a one-time cooperation; otherwise, I wouldn't have come to you for long-term partnership. Wang Bo isn't reliable, so we couldn't cooperate with him long-term."

Su Nantian's words were all truthful. At that time, according to Nan Gong Fei's opinion, they should have continued cooperating with Wang Bo. However, Su Nantian had strongly opposed it. This wasn't just about the subsequent deployment; actually, he had already uncovered Wang Bo's true nature. This person wasn't suitable for long-term cooperation with the Nan Gong family; otherwise, the Nan Gong family would have been sold out by Wang Bo.

At this moment, Li Zhe tightly clenched his fists and looked furious. He said, "It was him! I knew it all along. This kid has been guiding everything from the beginning, and even took photos of me with Nan Gong Fei. I guess this whole thing was already planned by you, right?"

Su Nantian nodded, "Yes. Our Nan Gong master also intentionally went to see you. I didn't expect the two of you could even have a conversation privately. So they were recorded on video and photos, and the content was taken out of context. It was just a casual conversation, but to others it looked like you were cooperating with Nan Gong. These pieces of evidence were recorded by Wang Bo, but he didn't expect you to answer so foolishly, which made the credibility of these pieces of evidence skyrocket several times."

Su Nantian had also heard about their situation from Wang Bo. It must be said that Li Zhe's response at the time was indeed very wrong.

"Alright, I've told you everything. I won't stay long. If there's anything else, we'll contact you. But before that, don't proactively contact us. Although people now think we've formed an alliance, we still need to maintain appearances."

After saying this, Su Nantian waved his hand and left Li Zhe's place to report the results of his negotiation back to Nan Gong Fei and Nan Gong Yuyan.

Su Nantian hadn't expected his negotiation to go so smoothly. It took less than an hour, and Su Nantian immediately drove back to the Nan Gong family.

However, when Su Nantian arrived at Nan Gong Lin's villa, he noticed that several cars not belonging to the Nan Gong family were parked at his front door.

"Looks like someone has come to visit the Nan Gong family..." Su Nantian muttered as he drove his car to the entrance of Nan Gong Yuyan's villa.

After all, Su Nantian worked at the inland port and was directly under Nan Gong Yuyan's leadership. Therefore, entering Nan Gong Yuyan's villa was no longer a rare occurrence.

Moreover, since Nan Gong Yuyan had been resting at home for several days, it was natural for him to enter directly.

Su Nantian met Nan Gong Yuyan in the study and immediately set aside the documents she was handling.

Nan Gong Yuyan had been very focused on Su Nantian recently and said, "Nantian, how did it go? How did your meeting with Li Zhe turn out?"

In fact, Nan Gong Yuyan had found it difficult to predict the outcome of Su Nantian's meeting. Although everyone said they prioritized interests, Li Zhe had just been framed by the Nan Gong family and Wang Bo. At this moment, he should have the deepest hatred toward both sides. Therefore, Su Nantian might not have succeeded.

However, what Su Nantian said next made Nan Gong Yuyan very happy. She heard Su Nantian say, "Li Zhe has already agreed to cooperate with us."

"That's great. We've finally gained an alliance at the inland port. Although Li Zhe's forces are the weakest among the three, they're still a big help for us. If we use them properly, they can definitely play their role."

After saying this, Nan Gong Yuyan stood up as if going somewhere.

Su Nantian noticed and immediately asked, "Miss, where are you going? Oh, by the way, when I came back, I noticed that there were several other people's cars parked in front of the old master's villa. Did someone come to visit the Nan Gong family?"

Su Nantian asked naturally, so it was hard to tell he was very curious about this matter.

Moreover, at this moment, Su Nantian was facing Nan Gong Yuyan. Given his feelings for her, he could answer almost anything she said except for some secrets of the Nan Gong family.

"Oh, it's probably the Wu family. They said yesterday that the Wu family would come to visit. After all, their new head has already been selected and just took office recently.

As the most important support for their vote, we naturally need to thank them first. Although real power is still in Wu Chuan's hands, it's still necessary to bring this girl along. Moreover, we've already discussed the exchange of conditions. In the future, if there are cooperation opportunities, we'll prioritize the Wu family. They probably came for this reason. I'm also going to visit now, since it's not right for the father to be alone. I guess my brother has already gone ahead, so you can come with me too."

At the end of her words, Nan Gong Yuyan waved to Su Nantian, indicating he should follow her to Nan Gong Lin's villa.

This was exactly what Su Nantian wanted. Upon hearing it was the Wu family coming, he had a desire to make contact. Moreover, from Nan Gong Yuyan's mouth, he also learned that Wu You'er might come along. Therefore, he had to go and investigate.

Chapter 594: The Wu Family's Visit

Su Nantian followed Nan Gong Yuyan toward Nan Gong Lin's villa. When they arrived, they noticed that the hall was already full of people.

After all, these were important figures from both the Nan Gong and Wu families. Therefore, the security was packed to do their job best.

Su Nantian immediately saw Nan Gong Lin and Nan Gong Ping sitting on the sofa. On another sofa, facing himself was Wu Chuan, while the other side's silhouette was very familiar to Su Nantian—this was Wu You'er.

Although Su Nantian was excited, he had to suppress his emotions. Therefore, he didn't show anything on the surface. However, after Su Nantian and Nan Gong Yuyan entered, the housekeeper immediately called out to Nan Gong Yuyan as "Miss," which drew everyone's attention.

Wu You'er also immediately saw Su Nantian standing behind Nan Gong Yuyan. Although at this moment, Su Nantian was disguised, Wu You'er had already seen his disguised form before. Therefore, he knew this person was him.

It was obvious that Wu You'er was excited upon seeing Su Nantian, but he thought again and realized it wasn't right. After all, he didn't have a close relationship with the people from the Nan Gong family. Therefore, showing such excitement now would only make Wu Chuan suspect.

Therefore, the next time Wu You'er quickly controlled his expression and pretended nothing had happened.

Upon seeing this change in Wu You'er's expression, Su Nantian couldn't help but admire him. If it were the previous Wu You'er, he would definitely not have been able to do this. It also showed that in the past few days, Wu You'er had become very cautious and had already learned to hide himself before others.

Thinking about this, Su Nantian felt a bit heartbroken. These baseless things had made a girl of the flower season become so cautious, which strengthened Su Nantian's desire to rescue Wu You'er immediately.

However, Su Nantian now clearly knew he couldn't save them all yet. If it were just Wu You'er, Su Nantian could rescue him in a moment. However, more importantly, there were Wu You'er's parents—Wu Tao and his wife.

This was the top priority for Su Nantian to research about Wu You'er's family. Only after ensuring Wu Tao and his wife's safety could he consider it a successful rescue.

That was why Su Nantian hadn't stayed in the Nan Gong family for so long, carefully planning step by step to eventually infiltrate the Wu family and carry out his plan.

But now, at least the situation was moving in a good direction. Because of the previous family selection event, the Nan Gong and Wu families had become very closely connected. Therefore, as long as Su Nantian continued to improve his position within the Nan Gong family, he would eventually be able to infiltrate the Wu family. And Su Nantian also felt this time wouldn't be too late.

"Yuyan, you're here. Nantian has also returned. How did the inland port's matters go?" Nan Gong Lin asked.

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian couldn't help but admire Nan Gong Lin deeply.

Nan Gong Lin's fox-like nature was apparent. On the surface, he seemed to be making casual small talk, but by mentioning the inland port's matters in front of Wu Chuan, he was actually giving Wu Chuan a warning.

Although Nan Gong Lin hadn't been involved in the inland port's matters recently, Su Nantian had reason to believe he knew everything clearly. Therefore, Nan Gong Lin must have known about the obstacles the Nan Gong family faced in the inland port. Otherwise, he wouldn't have deliberately asked these questions in front of Wu Chuan at this time.

After Nan Gong Yuyan greeted Nan Gong Lin, Su Nantian also greeted him and replied, "There were some difficulties in the inland port. However, they are gradually being resolved. I believe we can overcome all obstacles ahead."

Su Nantian was following Nan Gong Lin's words, as he wanted to show the difficulties they faced in the inland port before Wu Chuan. Otherwise, it would be a waste of Nan Gong Lin's question.

Indeed, the next second, Wu Chuan immediately said to Nan Gong Lin, "What's going on? What happened at the inland port? Or did those workers deliberately let them have advantages?"

In fact, Wu Chuan knew perfectly well what had happened at the inland port. Regarding the previous alliance of Zhang Yuan, Wang Bo, and Li Zhe against the Nan Gong family, Wu Chuan had just turned a blind eye. After all, this matter didn't affect him at all—so long as it didn't interfere with the work at the inland port.

Moreover, Wu Chuan actually welcomed seeing these people unite to oppose the Nan Gong family. After all, Wu Chuan had invested a lot to secure his position as head of the family. Three-quarters of the inland port was handed over to the Nan Gong family, and he could only gain a small profit this year.

Therefore, seeing the Nan Gong family suffer for a year was a psychological comfort for him.

"Indeed, there were some minor problems," Su Nantian said before Nan Gong Lin could speak.

"Oh, I'm sorry. Recently, I've been busy preparing for the new head of the family's inauguration, so I've been overwhelmed. Two days ago, I went to the inland port once to check on the handover situation. I found it was going well, so I thought there were no problems. Then I neglected to manage it for a while and didn't expect they would cause you trouble. Don't worry, after I finish my current tasks, I'll go to the inland port and give them a warning."

This Wu Chuan seemed very distressed on the surface, but everyone knew he was just making polite conversation. After all, Su Nantian had never mentioned what the problems were, yet he immediately offered a solution. It was clearly just polite talk.

However, this had achieved Nan Gong Lin's intention. He wanted to give Wu Chuan a warning. After this, Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo would probably be quiet for a while.

"Oh, if you're busy, there's no need to worry too much. Now that the Nan Gong family has already sent people over, they can handle it themselves. After all, your Wu family is in an important moment now. You need to complete the handover properly. These matters we Nan Gong family can handle ourselves," Nan Gong Lin said while smiling and laughing, appearing as a kind and approachable old man.

But everyone knew that beneath Nan Gong Lin's smile were far more profound implications.
