He regarded Master Hong as the heavens, following his every command without question. Even if Master Hong treated him harshly, Qiya harbored no resentment.

The search squad were those dispatched by Master Hong to track down Su Nantian's whereabouts.

Upon hearing their return, Master Hong immediately stood up. "Oh? They've returned already."

He had matters to ask them at that moment.

Qiya nodded immediately, responding to Master Hong. "Yes, adoptive father, they have returned."

After saying this, Qiya again addressed Master Hong. "Adoptive father, I've already had them wait in the meeting room for you."

Qiya was respectful and deferential, as if this were his natural duty.

"Waiting in the meeting room?"

Hearing Qiya's arrangement, Master Hong regarded him with increased respect, seemingly unaware that Qiya had arranged such matters. Yet he quickly composed himself and patted Qiya's shoulder, clearly pleased with his arrangement.

"Yes, well done. It seems our Qiya is growing wiser these days."

Master Hong laughed heartily, then cast a approving glance at Qiya. "Well done, well done. Our Qiya has truly matured."

Master Hong continued to lavish praise upon Qiya, his joy genuine.

After receiving Master Hong's commendation, Qiya smiled awkwardly, as if a child who had received his father's reward. Upon closer inspection, there was even a hint of shyness.

He also raised his hand to scratch the back of his head, speaking hesitantly. "Adoptive father... heh."

Chapter 839: Counting the Numbers

"You truly are a good child," Master Hong said again, unashamedly praising him. Qiya blushed deeply but still chuckled awkwardly.

"Anything I can do for adoptive father, I am willing to do."

At this moment, Qiya spoke again while scratching the back of his head. His sincere heart was laid bare before Master Hong, and he offered his loyalty without hesitation.

"You just completed the task I assigned you. You've worked hard, so go rest now. There's no need for you to worry about these matters."

Master Hong had just entrusted Qiya with a mission that no one else could complete. He had merely hoped to test his luck, and even if he suffered losses, it wouldn't have been too great a blow.

Yet now Qiya had returned unscathed and completed the task, even surpassing his expectations. Master Hong was therefore quite satisfied.

In truth, did Master Hong truly praise Qiya? No. He merely wished to solidify his loyalty, using him as a tool and expecting Qiya to continue serving without complaint.

Moreover, when other subordinates succeeded in their tasks, Master Hong would reward them with money, status, or women. These people all sought material gains.

But Qiya was different. Every time Master Hong gave him something, he refused it. He always insisted on one thing: that if he could ease Master Hong's burdens and help him, he would do anything without hesitation.

And every time, all it took was a few words of praise from Master Hong to make Qiya devote himself completely. This was an inexpensive deal, and Master Hong, far from foolish, would never let go of it.

At this moment, he was simply pleased that Qiya had accomplished something no one else could. He also appreciated his obedience and maturity, unlike the other subordinates who constantly sought benefits.

But Master Hong had no real intentions toward Qiya. He was merely treating him as a pet or a dog, occasionally playing with him when in a good mood.

But if one day Qiya lost his abilities and became a burden, Master Hong would discard him without hesitation, wasting no effort on him.

As for now, Master Hong felt that the time and energy he had spent rescuing Qiya was not wasted at all. He now used him to the fullest extent.

Qiya always obeyed Master Hong's every word, and no matter what he was told—even if it were to kill himself—he would carry out the order without hesitation.

So when Master Hong told him to rest, Qiya had no objections and immediately nodded respectfully. "Yes, adoptive father."

Qiya responded politely and then left.

Master Hong watched Qiya's retreating figure with satisfaction, his lips curling into a smirk laced with mockery.

Yes, like this—continuing to serve him in deception until the end of his life.

At that moment, Master Hong stepped out to visit the meeting room and see if his subordinates had brought any good news.

"Master Hong,"

When Master Hong reached the meeting room's entrance, he saw Bai Assistant standing there. Upon seeing Master Hong, Bai Assistant nodded and smiled obsequiously, eager to show his devotion.

"They've all returned. They're waiting inside for you, Master Hong!" Bai Assistant spoke immediately, thinking to himself at the same time. The whole family said Qiya was a foolish and simple-minded man.

Hmph!

Bai Assistant muttered in his heart. What nonsense! He wasn't foolish at all—he was quite clever.

It was Qiya's duty to arrange the search squad, yet he had taken it upon himself without a word. He had rushed to report to Master Hong immediately after returning.

It seemed as if all the work was done by him alone, and his only focus was on Master Hong. That was why he had gone to see Master Hong right after returning, as if he were born solely for Master Hong.

"Yes."

Compared to Bai Assistant's eagerness, Master Hong remained calm and gave him no extra glance. "Enter."

Master Hong spoke softly, then gestured for Bai Assistant to open the door and walked in first.

Bai Assistant followed closely behind, but as he thought about Master Hong's coldness toward him, his face almost twisted. Yet in his heart, he blamed Qiya for the problem.

He thought it was Qiya who had stolen these merits. Otherwise, Master Hong would never have been so cold toward him.

But Bai Assistant only muttered in his heart and criticized Qiya, never daring to confront or accuse him directly. For one thing, Qiya was Master Hong's adopted son; regardless of how much genuine care Master Hong had for him, his status was above Bai Assistant's.

For another, Qiya possessed supernatural strength. To oppose him would result in a fate of death without a trace. Thus, Bai Assistant would never dare to provoke Qiya.

"Master Hong,"

The people in the meeting room had been chattering and discussing their intelligence and search progress. Each one was pretending to be wise, subtly probing for information.

After all, they had all witnessed Master Hong's emphasis on this mission. Whoever found Su Nantian first would gain more status in Master Hong's eyes, and possibly even rise with the tide.

Upon seeing Master Hong enter, they all fell silent instantly, as if mice encountering a cat. They respectfully greeted Master Hong.

Their voices were perfectly synchronized, like they had been trained, with the same volume and rhythm.

"Yes."

Master Hong waved his hand, indicating them to sit. He nodded arrogantly in response.

At this moment, Master Hong was also observing them with a sidelong glance, trying to discern what they were thinking.

When he saw Bai Assistant at the door, he waved him over. They all entered the meeting room together.

"Master Hong, please go ahead."

Bai Assistant, who had just been rebuffed by Master Hong, dared not say anything.

Chapter 840: Discussing Strategy

"Please go ahead."

Bai Assistant nodded and smiled obsequiously. At this moment, he was extremely respectful toward Master Hong.

When opening the door for him, he let Master Hong enter first. Every detail was carefully considered, with Master Hong as the supreme authority.

"Yes."

No one disliked being flattered. Even if they were at a high position, Master Hong was no exception.

He raised his head slightly with an air of arrogance and cast a brief glance at Bai Assistant before entering.

Yet Master Hong's mood had eased slightly, thinking that Bai Assistant was quite perceptive.

"Master Hong!"

When Master Hong entered, everyone stood up immediately. They were as afraid of Master Hong as Bai Assistant.

"Yes, sit down."

Master Hong waved his hand again and had them all sit. His expression adjusted slightly, becoming more amiable than before.

The reason Master Hong had called them back so urgently was to obtain some clues he cared about. However, when counting the numbers, one team was missing.

"Where is another team?" Master Hong frowned, displeased. These people were not only slow in their efficiency but also indifferent to him. How dare they miss the meeting? The thought made Master Hong even more annoyed.

The other teams had always been wary of Master Hong. Upon hearing his question, they exchanged glances, unsure why one team had gone missing.

They looked at each other, trying to determine which team was absent.

"Who are the ones who haven't returned?" Master Hong frowned and asked impatiently.

Upon seeing Master Hong's expression change, Bai Assistant immediately stepped forward. He first quickly scanned the people present and then urgently informed Master Hong: "Master Hong, it's Long and Chuan with six others."

After reporting their identities, Bai Assistant also felt a quiet resentment in his heart.

He thought that Master Hong's mood was already bad enough, and these people were so lazy and indifferent. They wouldn't be punished for it, but they had dragged him into trouble—this was their problem!

Bai Assistant's face was somewhat grim, but he dared not show it in front of Master Hong.

After thinking it through, Bai Assistant felt even more resentful. He thought that once they returned, he would definitely take back what was owed to him.

Master Hong had no good mood at this moment. Upon hearing Bai Assistant's answer, he immediately frowned again: "Where are they? Where are they now? Bring them back immediately! What kind of conduct is this!"

They had the audacity to miss such an important meeting. They truly didn't respect him at all.

The more he thought about it, the worse Master Hong's expression became. He felt that he had given them face and allowed them to take advantage of him repeatedly, acting so boldly.

Originally, Master Hong had recovered some mood due to Bai Assistant's perceptiveness and flattery. Now, he wished to crush all these people into dust.

They didn't yet know that Long and Chuan had already met with misfortune, nor did they realize they were now under Su Nantian's attention and would soon come to find him.

Master Hong furrowed his brows, displeased. He continued scolding: "You couldn't even do such a small task! What have you been doing all day?"

After Master Hong said this, the subordinates who had thought they wouldn't be targeted also lowered their heads. None dared to challenge Master Hong, fearing he would continue to reprimand them.

At the same time, they cursed Long and Chuan in their hearts, thinking it was because of them that they were being criticized.

"Master Hong! I'll go check now. Please rest assured," Bai Assistant muttered in his heart but still had to report to Master Hong before leaving, then went out to contact Long and Chuan.

"These people! They really are lazy! How dare they miss such an important day! It's ridiculous!"

After Bai Assistant left, he couldn't help but mutter to himself. He thought Long and Chuan were useless—didn't do the task Master Hong assigned them, yet dragged others into trouble.

Unfortunately, he called each of these teams but found they were all turned off. No one answered.

"Hey?"

At this moment, Bai Assistant was also puzzled. He asked himself: "What's going on? Could they all be turned off at the same time?"

At this point, Bai Assistant's mood became even worse.

He hung up and went directly to the place where Long and Chuan lived. The feedback he received was even more unsettling.

"Are you saying they didn't return after leaving?" Bai Assistant looked at the records and furrowed his brows tighter.

This shouldn't be happening. No call, no return. Could it be?

Bai Assistant's eyes suddenly widened in shock, round and frightening. His mind thought of a possibility again, and his eyes widened even more.

"Did something happen to them?"

Bai Assistant spoke softly, muttering. His expression was very anxious, red and pale in patches, unsure what to do.

"Master Hong! Something's wrong!"

He rushed back into the meeting room immediately, wanting to inform Master Hong of what he had just discovered. This was a big or small matter; if he didn't report it, he couldn't bear the responsibility.

"Master Hong! What's wrong? You're so restless and can't do anything properly. You've even forgotten your usual decorum!"

In fact, people like Master Hong who had retired and rebranded didn't care much about decorum. He was merely dissatisfied with Bai Assistant now, so he took the opportunity to criticize him and find any flaws.

Bai Assistant knew it was because of this reason, but he had no time to say anything else. He swallowed his saliva and took a deep breath, finally calming his breathing.

"Master Hong, I just called them but couldn't reach anyone. And they haven't returned either."

Saying this, Bai Assistant showed a worried expression: "Master Hong, I think they might have encountered something."

Otherwise, how could they not return at all?

After Bai Assistant said this, the meeting room immediately became noisy. The other subordinates also exchanged glances, their expressions full of confusion.

Chapter 841: Clues

"Disappeared?"

The meeting room instantly became noisy. These subordinates looked uneasy, muttering: "What does it mean to have something happen?"

How could this happen so suddenly?

They were all ordered to find Su Nantian. There was no danger during this time.

Could it be?

At the thought, everyone's expressions changed. They had guessed the possibility.

Master Hong's eyes lit up as well. If they could guess it, so could he. Had they met Su Nantian and thus couldn't contact the base?

Otherwise, how could there be no news at all?

"Quick! First locate them and see if we can find their last position."

Master Hong had no time for other matters now. He had finally found a clue and couldn't let it slip away.

He hurriedly ordered Bai Assistant to act quickly: "We can't miss any traces!"

This was key information for finding Su Nantian!

He had planned so long, and he couldn't let it go to waste.

He was also hoping to find Su Nantian and relay the information to the Xu family, then gain favor with them.

He couldn't let Su Nantian escape.

Upon hearing Master Hong's focus was no longer on them, and his urgency, Bai Assistant immediately nodded without delay.

"Yes! Master Hong, rest assured. I'll handle it right away!"

Fortunately, these communications were issued by their headquarters, so there was a record. If they could find the last time they turned on, they could determine their location.

With this position, it would be easy to find them.

Bai Assistant didn't waste time. After briefly informing Master Hong, he left.

The other subordinates also went out with Bai Assistant to help. They couldn't stay in Master Hong's presence.

Everyone knew that Master Hong was like a bomb, and no one knew when he would ignite.

"Haha! It's as if the iron shoe was found without effort!"

These subordinates were not idle. They all went down to help. After they left, Master Hong sat in the meeting room and felt inspired, his expression full of pride and arrogance.

He was already planning how to deal with Su Nantian after finding him, and how to approach the Xu family for more benefits.

He seemed to have no thought of possibly failing or making a mistake after finding Su Nantian. He had no such thoughts at all.

It seemed Master Hong believed that once he found Su Nantian's location, he could definitely deal with him.

Master Hong now completely regarded Su Nantian as a stepping stone to his success. Once he found Su Nantian, he could smoothly connect with the Xu family.

Then, he could climb another step in M City.

"Haha! Su Nantian, Xu family!"

At this moment, Master Hong seemed to have thought of something. His lips slightly curled into a mocking arc. He was currently constrained by the Xu family, but once he climbed higher, his first target would be the Xu family!

On the other hand, the Xu family had not remained hidden or waited for news. They had already started to take action.

"Have you roughly determined the location?"

At this moment, Xu Xiangning had received Master Hong's message from his subordinates. She was excited and felt she could finally raise her head in the Xu family.

Moreover, Xu Xiangning was eager to announce to everyone that she wasn't idle at all.

Xu Xiangning had no idea that Master Hong's message was exaggerated, nor did she think Master Hong was also scheming against her.

Xu Xiangning had good skincare and a family background, so she was always smooth sailing. No one would dare to disrespect her or offend the Xu family.

Because of this, when Xu Xiangning went out, she was always treated like a star. Her status was considerable.

Therefore, Xu Xiangning often forgot her true identity. She thought she had charmed Master Hong with her charm.

So when she received Master Hong's message, she didn't doubt it at all. Instead, she was proud of her charm, thinking Master Hong was under her control.

"Madam Xu, Master Hong said your matter is the top priority here. Any news will be reported to you immediately."

"Master Hong's subordinate spoke very well, making Xu Xiangning very happy.

After saying these words, he continued to say: "You don't know, Master Hong personally ordered that your matter should be the top priority. Other matters can be ignored, but your issue must be handled first. Absolutely no negligence!"

After saying this, the subordinate smiled at Xu Xiangning and made her compliant.

"Haha, of course. You don't know what relationship I have with Master Hong."

Xu Xiangning replied arrogantly at this moment. She had no idea these words were just flattery.

After replying, Xu Xiangning continued: "Alright, I've received your message. Tell Master Hong that I'll come personally to thank him another day."

Since Master Hong had fulfilled her request, she naturally needed to give a good feedback to repay his kindness.

After all, men are just like that. If they're comfortable, they'll work harder next time.

Thinking of this, Xu Xiangning's gaze deepened slightly. She quickly sent away the messenger and had him return.

After sending away the subordinate, Xu Xiangning returned to her room and slowly opened Master Hong's letter.

She saw that it contained a rough range, and only locked onto five rivers. She was不满 and muttered: "Only this much information?"

She had waited for a whole week, so Master Hong's efficiency was really low.

Xu Xiangning also wanted to be the first priority, and she hoped Master Hong would immediately catch Su Nantian.

But soon, Xu Xiangning quickly comforted herself.

Master Hong wasn't a three-headed six-armed person, and he had many other things to do. It was difficult for him to focus on this matter.

Chapter 842: Foreseeing the Future

It was already difficult enough. Moreover, this place was vast, and finding one person was extremely challenging.

Yes, that's it.

Xu Xiangning comforted herself in this way and quickly convinced herself.

Moreover, Xu Xiangning now felt that she and Master Hong were interdependent. She had no other help but Master Hong, so she couldn't afford to anger him at this moment.

She looked down and was happy with the news she had just received.

Xu Xiangning quickly thought of her mother, who always regarded her as a useless person. It seemed she could only serve as the face of the Xu family, and couldn't help with any real matters.

"Hmph! Always looking down on me!"

Xu Xiangning sneered, feeling angry. But now she had the news and could tell her mother to change their opinion of her.

Moreover, Wu Chuan was Xu Xiangning's son. Even if they had no emotional connection, his identity meant she had to care about him.

Now that she had found the killer of her son, Xu Xiangning was naturally happy. She also specifically sat in front of the mirror to get ready, then go report to her mother and change their opinion of her.

Xu Xiangning was in a good mood, slowly getting ready for herself.

She didn't know that the fact that Master Hong's subordinates had come to find her was already noticed by the Xu family. They hadn't missed any of her actions, and everyone knew what she had done.

At this moment, Xu Xiangning's brother Xu Hai quickly came to the study of Old Lady Xu to report this matter.

Xu Xiangning was still smug, unaware that her secrets had already been exposed. She was thinking about how to tell her mother about her abilities.

Xu Xiangning also didn't want to tell Old Lady Xu that this information was obtained through Master Hong's investigation.

"Hmph! Let them look down on me. I'll show them my strength!"

Xu Xiangning held a comb, brushing her hair while muttering. Her behavior was任性 and had no trace of family dignity.

"Mother, it seems my sister has some movement."

Xu Hai respectfully reported: "Should I have someone follow her?"

Xu Hai asked again, concerned and waiting for Old Lady Xu's instructions.

In fact, all of Xu Xiangning and Master Hong's movements were under their control. They had exposed themselves to everyone's eyes.

But Xu Xiangning's abilities were not enough to find these clues, so she wouldn't discover this issue.

Therefore, when Xu Hai received the news, he immediately reported to Old Lady Xu. He wasn't trying to take credit but was worried that his foolish sister would do something stupid.

That's why Xu Hai put aside his own matters and came to report to Old Lady Xu first.

"Hmph, it's probably just a small sweetener. No need to waste effort."

Old Lady Xu shook her head dismissively, her voice also very contemptuous. She had already seen through Master Hong's trick and didn't take the information he passed to Xu Xiangning seriously.

"Did you think Master Hong, that old fox, truly took Xu Xiangning as a concubine?"

Old Lady Xu spoke dismissively. Her eyes and expressions were wise.

Her intelligence was not hidden by age, even with white hair she still revealed her cleverness. Moreover, Old Lady Xu had a strong jaw and high cheekbones. Additionally, she had triangular eyes, which in facial analysis indicated a ruthless person who could endure hardship.

It was because of these unique features and her tenacity that she had supported the Xu family as a woman. This made the Xu family one of M City's top families and successfully entered the ranks of the elite.

Moreover, Old Lady Xu had a good family background. She was well-versed in many secrets and understood the strategies of negotiation tables.

Master Hong, although capable, was ultimately a grassroots person who had climbed through hardship. Compared to Old Lady Xu, he clearly lacked some skills.

"What...?"

Xu Hai hesitated and worried after hearing Old Lady Xu's words. "Don't we need to pay attention?"

Xu Hai hesitated for a long time before asking. He thought that regardless of whether Master Hong was under their control or not, they needed to thoroughly investigate him to avoid being caught off guard by his tricks.

Moreover, Xu Hai's personality was always like this. He liked to prepare for everything so he could have no regrets.

"No need," Old Lady Xu insisted on her view. She looked at Xu Hai with a slight glance and said, "You're smart but too indecisive."

After a pause, Old Lady Xu continued: "Why think so much? It's like worrying about something that won't happen."

Being hesitant and timid would never achieve great things. As long as they knew their own cards and abilities, even if Master Hong had other ambitions, he would only be able to move within their allowed space.

If they annoyed them, just eliminate him. Why worry about this and that?

After thinking this through, Old Lady Xu's gaze toward Xu Hai had a hint of disappointment.

She thought about her iron-willed and resilient life. How could each child not be like her?

"I...,"

Xu Hai had originally good intentions, but after being criticized by his mother, he felt a bit embarrassed. He instinctively spoke to explain.

Old Lady Xu raised her hand at this moment, interrupting Xu Hai's words and indicating he didn't need to say more.

Then Old Lady Xu continued: "Moreover, according to your sister's character, even if we don't investigate, she would come to us soon."

At this point, Old Lady Xu looked at her watch. As soon as she did this, a knock came on the door.

"Mother truly foresaw everything!"

Xu Hai looked at Old Lady Xu in surprise, thinking she was indeed the one who had led the Xu family through these turbulent times. Even with surrounding waves, she remained steadfast.

Chapter 843: Mutual Schemes

"Mother's advice is correct. I will pay attention to these flaws in the future," Xu Hai said, who had felt a bit委屈 and dissatisfaction earlier but now became admiration and belief.

Xu Hai thought he still had a long way to go, unsure when he would reach his mother's position.

He originally thought Xu Xiangning would hold back, but she was indeed no different from before.

Thinking about this, Xu Hai didn't know whether to think his sister was foolish or be glad that her foolishness wouldn't bring him too much trouble.

"Haha, you go first. If she sees you, she won't say these intimate words,"

Old Lady Xu waved her hand now and indicated that Xu Hai should leave first. When she said the words "intimate words," she clearly emphasized her tone.

Moreover, listening closely, there was a hint of mockery. Clearly, she had already guessed what Xu Xiangning would say.

Old Lady Xu was also very clear that Xu Xiangning's thoughts were not worth mentioning.

"Yes, Mother."

Xu Hai had no objections. He was also very familiar with his sister's character—she was good for nothing and bad at everything.

She often thought too much, treating them as thieves to guard against.

Old Lady Xu was right. If Xu Xiangning saw Xu Hai there, she definitely wouldn't tell Old Lady Xu these things. After all, they were her chips and how could she reveal them so easily?

She wanted to let Old Lady Xu know her strength, making them realize that she was no worse than Xu Hai and others. So how could she reveal her cards with Xu Hai there?

"Son, I'm leaving."

Xu Hai said no more nonsense. He bowed to Old Lady Xu and left first.

"Mother! How come it's you?"

Xu Xiangning stood at the door. When she saw someone open the door, she thought it was Old Lady Xu coming to open it for her. She immediately put on a bright smile and spoke with a touch of sweetness.

But when she saw it was Xu Hai, her smile immediately froze on her face. Her eyebrows also furrowed, and her eyes showed clear dislike and contempt.

Xu Hai was inwardly amused. He hadn't looked down on his sister, but she had started to look down on him. This was unknown to the ignorant.

But regardless, Xu Hai wouldn't argue with Xu Xiangning. It wasn't that he was afraid but that he looked down on her.

"Big sister,"

He thought arguing with someone like Xu Xiangning was lowering his own status. So he just greeted her and left without giving her an extra glance.

Hmph!

Who knew that Xu Xiangning was looking at Xu Hai's back with disdain in her heart, expressing her contempt and dissatisfaction.

Moreover, Xu Xiangning had no idea where she was thinking. It seemed like Xu Hai was looking down on her, so she secretly sneered and said in her heart that when she regained her position, Xu Hai would know her strength.

"Mother～"

Xu Xiangning adjusted her expression and smiled brightly, then pushed the door open. She was smiling like a flower or even more brilliantly than one.

In fact, Xu Xiangning had initially wanted to wait a bit longer, making this matter more important. Then she would make an entrance at the most important moment to change everyone's opinion of her.

But after walking around in the room for a few steps, she couldn't hold back. She felt this was such an important opportunity that she couldn't waste it.

Moreover, Xu Xiangning was worried that Master Hong had spent so much time finding this information and that Xu Hai's group would also find out soon. To seize the initiative, she changed her mind and immediately went to inform Old Lady Xu.

Old Lady Xu looked at Xu Xiangning without expression, said nothing, and smiled. Then she waved her hand and pointed to the chair beside her.

"Come here and sit. Why is your mood so good today? You came to talk to Mother?"

Old Lady Xu asked in a feigned manner, pretending to be ignorant. She wanted to make Xu Xiangning unaware that she had already guessed her secret and knew her intention.

"Mother, what are you saying? I'm just coming to visit Mother and show filial piety,"
