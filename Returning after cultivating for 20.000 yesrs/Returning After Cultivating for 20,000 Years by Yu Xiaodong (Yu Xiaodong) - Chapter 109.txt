“Then below is Tom’s signature and his palm print. Lao Lai pointed at the death contract, saying to Su Nantian: ‘Take a good look. You still have time to regret. If you sign this death contract and then change your mind, it’ll be too late.’”

Su Nantian laughed after hearing this and replied: “I said I wouldn’t regret it. You don’t need to say that again. I’ll sign it.”

Su Nantian directly signed his name and pressed his palm print onto the contract. Then he immediately jumped onto the boxing ring.

Tom had been warming up on the stage for a long time. Seeing Su Nantian finally arrive, he immediately said: “You coward! You’ve finally come. I’ve been waiting here for a long time and am already eager to knock you out.”

“Who will knock whom is uncertain. I advise you not to be so arrogant before the results are known. Do you think winning a few matches abroad makes you invincible? That’s because you’ve never encountered kung fu.”

As he spoke, Su Nantian performed a martial arts move, which looked very authentic.

“Hahahaha! You think I don’t know your kung fu has long been lost. What remains now is only a superficial imitation. What’s there to fear? Everyone pretends to be strong, but you’ve already become hollow inside. Even Lao Lai hired me with a lot of money to guard this ring, which shows how useless you all are.”

After saying that, Tom laughed heartily. He clearly looked down on them, even the Lao Lai who had hired him was someone he despised.

“Enough talk. Let’s see who wins in the ring,” Su Nantian said and immediately assumed a ready stance, staring intently at Tom.

In truth, Su Nantian had full confidence he could beat Tom. He had observed Tom during their conversation and clearly saw that Tom was a boxer with strong upper-body strength, especially his arms and fists. However, he also noticed Tom’s lower body was relatively weak—only slightly stronger than an average person. Therefore, if he adjusted his attacks to Tom’s lower body, he could easily render him helpless.

But Su Nantian also considered that he couldn’t reveal his full strength here. If he showed his complete power now, it might make Yuan Daying and He Zun suspect his true purpose for coming to Haiwang Gang. Thus, he had to slightly suppress his current strength and fight evenly with Tom before finally knocking him out.

Su Nantian thought that if he fully exposed his strength in front of Yuan Daying and He Zun, they might feel wary of him. After all, Haiwang Gang was a place where strength ruled. The sudden appearance of someone stronger than them might make them wonder if the Southern Palace had targeted their gang.

If that happened, it would create significant obstacles for Su Nantian, as he had no intention of developing in that direction. If people thought that way, his subsequent plans might be hindered.

At this moment, Tom and Su Nantian were in a stalemate. Although Tom had spoken arrogantly before, Su Nantian noticed that once Tom stepped onto the ring, he became extremely cautious. Even though he had previously mocked them relentlessly, now Tom was carefully observing Su Nantian’s every move.

This made Su Nantian realize why Tom had won so many matches elsewhere. Despite his loud words on the ground, once he stepped onto the ring, his entire demeanor changed completely.

This made Su Nantian raise his attention. He had originally planned to relax a bit, but now he realized he must pay close attention to details; otherwise, he might be knocked out by Tom.

Below the ring, Yuan Daying, He Zun, and Lao Lai watched the action. Yuan Daying and He Zun seemed relatively calm, but Lao Lai was quite anxious.

“Tom! Hurry up and finish him! You said you were so strong. I spent so much money to hire you, not to let you waste time with this little person!”

Clearly, Tom’s cautious behavior did not match Lao Lai’s expectations. He had hoped Tom would immediately knock out the people Yuan Daying and He Zun sent, but instead, both were now in a stalemate without anyone moving.

However, Tom was completely unaffected by Lao Lai’s shouting. Despite Lao Lai yelling loudly below, Tom remained focused on his original pace. He needed to observe the opponent and had realized that Su Nantian was truly formidable.

If Tom had been influenced by Lao Lai, he would have already lost the match. Therefore, he now had to concentrate fully and only focus his eyes on Su Nantian.

He needed to lock onto this single target and complete the match diligently, regardless of what was said below.

When Su Nantian saw Tom’s behavior, he couldn’t help but give him a thumbs-up. He had already realized that Tom was no ordinary person, and his previous wins were all due to his own skills.

At the same time, Su Nantian was observing Tom’s every move. After assessing Tom with his experience earlier, he now made a new judgment based on Tom’s continuous trembling body and his eyes and attention.

Chapter 539: Embarrassment

Although people below thought Su Nantian and Tom were still in a stalemate, Yuan Daying, who understood the game, knew that both were preparing for the next phase. If they acted rashly at this stage, it might affect the overall result of the match.

Finally, Tom moved first. His movements were extremely fast, rushing toward Su Nantian and throwing a punch aimed at his face. The fist was high, directly targeting Su Nantian’s temple.

Su Nantian wasn’t someone to be trifled with. Although Tom’s movements were fast, Su Nantian’s reaction was equally quick. Because both had been moving continuously, Su Nantian immediately stepped back to dodge the punch. However, the wind of the fist had brushed past Su Nantian’s face, and the crowd could see his hair being lifted by Tom’s punch.

This punch was as sudden as a thunderclap. The crowd below, including Lao Lai and his subordinates, immediately cheered loudly.

“Great! Tom, keep it up. Finish this kid!”

Lao Lai continued shouting below.

After hearing Lao Lai’s words, Su Nantian smiled slightly. He thought that Lao Lai was actually helping him because everyone knew that at this moment, the match couldn’t be distracted. However, Lao Lai kept shouting at Tom below.

Even if Tom concentrated fully, after such prolonged interference, he would inevitably be affected.

Clearly, after this punch, Tom’s brow furrowed upon hearing Lao Lai’s words. He was very annoyed by Lao Lai constantly interfering with him on the stage.

At this moment, Tom suddenly stopped and said to Su Nantian: “Wait a moment. I need to say something to him.”

Su Nantian smiled slightly and nodded: “You go ahead. I can wait a while.”

“Thank you,” Tom said, then walked from the center of the ring to the side and approached Lao Lai.

Lao Lai thought Tom had something to say, so he immediately smiled and said: “Tom, what’s wrong? Do you need anything or have something to ask me?”

But Tom directly pointed at Lao Lai and said: “Do you still want to win this match?”

Lao Lai didn’t understand what Tom meant at first and replied: “Of course I do. We must win, so we can make big money.”

“If you want to win, then shut your mouth below and don’t constantly shout at me or command me. If you continue like this, I won’t fight for you anymore! If you keep interfering with me, I’ll just admit defeat on the ring!”

Clearly, it was rare for Tom, who had never lost a match, to say such words on the ring. This showed how far Lao Lai had pushed him.

After hearing Tom’s words, Lao Lai felt somewhat embarrassed. However, he thought about how this man was his future source of profit. If Tom won the match, he would take over Haiwang Gang’s bar and his business would definitely be very good. Moreover, Tom had promised to fight in his underground boxing gym. Thinking about these things, Lao Lai suppressed his anger and continued to smile: “Sorry, really sorry. I won’t speak anymore, but you must defeat this kid!”

At that moment, Yuan Daying also approached and patted Lao Lai’s shoulder: “Lao Lai, why do you keep interfering with the match? It has made Tom lose his fighting spirit. Don’t interfere anymore, it’s annoying.”

Yuan Daying said this and didn’t wait for Lao Lai to respond. He immediately walked back and laughed with his group of Haiwang Gang subordinates.

Lao Lai didn’t feel Tom’s words were too serious. Although he was angry, he knew Tom was his godsend. Only if Tom won this match could he get what he wanted.

But now Yuan Daying had mocked him, which raised Lao Lai’s anger several levels.

“Tom, I’ll say it again. You must win! If you do, I’ll double the money for you!” Lao Lai said fiercely to Tom.

After hearing this, Tom only nodded and then turned back to continue the match with Su Nantian.

“You’ve waited long enough. I’ve settled things, so let’s continue,” Tom said to Su Nantian.

Thus, Su Nantian and Tom returned to the battle stance again. Actually, Su Nantian had agreed for Tom to speak with Lao Lai because it was his strategy.

Once someone entered a combat state and was interrupted, it was very difficult to regain that emotional state. Therefore, Su Nantian had no hesitation in allowing Tom to speak with Lao Lai.

Moreover, now Su Nantian clearly noticed that after returning, Tom’s fighting spirit had significantly weakened. Plus, because Su Nantian had generously allowed him to pause the match, Tom now subconsciously felt a bit of goodwill toward Su Nantian.

This kind of emotion would inevitably lead Tom to be at a slight disadvantage in the next match.

After this small incident, they returned to the battle stance again.

Tom still initiated the attack first because he now felt he had understood Su Nantian, so he could attack without hesitation. He believed the places he attacked were all weaknesses for Su Nantian.

After observing, he thought Su Nantian’s upper body strength was very weak, especially his arms.

Therefore, Tom chose to attack high places, like the temple he had attacked first. If Su Nantian wanted to block this attack, he would have to raise his arms to defend the punch.

But based on Tom’s initial estimation of Su Nantian, he thought that if Su Nantian fought back directly, he would definitely lose to him. Therefore, even if Su Nantian blocked the punch with his arms, Tom would cause great damage to his arms. Repeating this over time, Su Nantian’s arms could be crippled.

Chapter 540: Counterattack

Su Nantian, through Tom’s attacks, had already understood Tom’s current mindset. He couldn’t help but laugh coldly. Unexpectedly, Tom thought his upper body was a weak spot, which made Su Nantian feel both amused and exasperated.

Tom’s attacks continued to fall on Su Nantian’s upper body, while Su Nantian endured silently without any chance to fight back. Below the ring, Lao Lai and Yuan Daying showed completely different attitudes.

Lao Lai now saw Tom’s dominant strategy, feeling extremely excited. He wanted to cheer for Tom below but remembered Tom’s instructions and covered his mouth with his hand.

However, the expression of superiority on his face was unbearable, especially as he kept glancing at Yuan Daying beside him, almost like showing off.

Yuan Daying now had a dark face. He hadn’t expected Su Nantian, who had confidently told him he could beat Tom, to now be beaten without any chance to fight back.

贺尊, standing beside Yuan Daying, also furrowed his brows and finally walked up to Yuan Daying and said: “Leader, I told you this kid was untrustworthy. You insisted on sending him to fight, and now look at the situation—beaten without any chance to fight back, terrified.”

Yuan Daying’s heart sank. He had wanted to tell He Zun not to let others’ strength overshadow their own, but when he saw Su Nantian still holding on desperately on the ring, he felt that the match’s outcome was already decided.

So Yuan Daying could only sigh slightly and turned to He Zun, saying: “It’s already too late now. There’s no use talking about it. Let’s see how he handles it next.”

He Zun now tightly clenched his fists and whispered to Yuan Daying: “Leader, even if this kid isn’t killed by Tom, I’ll have someone kill him after he comes down. Hope you don’t stop me. Our whole bar was ruined by him, and the loss of business is something you know better than I do.”

“I understand. Let it be as you wish. I won’t interfere anymore,” Yuan Daying nodded and replied, saying nothing more.

He Zun now got Yuan Daying’s approval and stared fiercely at Su Nantian on the ring, as if the result of this match was already decided and Su Nantian had already lost.

But at that moment, Su Nantian was completely unaware. The reason he hadn’t fought back was to show that he wasn’t so strong, so as not to make Yuan Daying and He Zun immediately sense his immense strength.

However, Su Nantian hadn’t anticipated that this situation had already made Yuan Daying and He Zun decide to kill him. If Su Nantian had known this, he wouldn’t have hesitated; perhaps he would have immediately used a killing move on Tom.

After a bout of fighting, Su Nantian felt the situation was over. He had taken many punches from Tom and had been defending with his arms without any chance to fight back, appearing completely at a disadvantage.

Now it was time for him to counterattack.

Tom, although continuously attacking Su Nantian, was more清醒 than those below. After attacking Su Nantian for a while, he realized that it wasn’t going as planned. Su Nantian’s arms were still protecting several positions.

Moreover, he felt that this Su Nantian was always in control and hadn’t become desperate from his attacks. His breathing remained stable, unlike those who were beaten to the point of exhaustion.

Because Tom had a lot of experience in ring battles, he could immediately tell what someone’s reaction would be if they were truly beaten. Most likely, they would become exhausted and start panting, their steps lightened. But Su Nantian showed none of these signs.

Even Su Nantian was still composed, which made Tom feel very strange.

However, at this moment, Su Nantian’s eyes suddenly narrowed, and his whole body seemed to radiate a brilliant light.

Then Su Nantian whispered in a voice only Tom could hear: “I’ve played enough with you. Now it’s my turn to counterattack.”

After that, Su Nantian even smiled slightly. This made Tom feel a chill, as after such a fight, he should have felt very hot, but now he felt his back go cold and broke out in a sweat.

Tom’s mind suddenly realized something was wrong. Su Nantian had been playing with him all along, keeping his strength back. Even after taking so many punches from Tom, he hadn’t fought back, all to wait for this moment.

But at that moment, Su Nantian’s fist flashed like lightning toward Tom’s face. Tom couldn’t dodge in time; he didn’t even know the trajectory of this punch. In his eyes, there was only a blur, and before he could determine where the fist was going, it had already reached his face.

Then he felt a heavy impact on his face. This punch directly hit Tom’s nose.

Su Nantian aimed precisely. The most painful part of a facial attack is the nose, which is why most people’s tears are triggered immediately after being hit there and feel intense pain.

This punch not only made Tom cry but also made his nose bone break, with blood flowing out.

Tom now felt completely disoriented and dizzy, with stars spinning in front of his eyes.

Everyone could see Tom on the ring holding his face and stumbling around, as if he would fall at any moment.

The people below, including Lao Lai and Yuan Daying and He Zun, couldn’t believe that Su Nantian had successfully counterattacked in an instant and made Tom look like he couldn’t fight back.

Chapter 541: Surrender the Bar

The situation on the ring immediately turned around. Everyone gasped, and even Lao Lai, who had been covering his mouth, shouted loudly.

“Tom! What’s wrong with you? Fight back and beat this kid!”

Lao Lai now no longer cared about what Tom had said earlier. He wished he could step into the ring and beat Su Nantian himself.

At this moment, Tom on the stage could barely hear what was being said below. He only knew that his surroundings were very noisy because he felt dizzy and confused, with all kinds of noise in his ears. He could hear the chaos around him but couldn’t understand what people were saying.

Su Nantian saw Tom’s condition and confirmed he had been knocked out. He then waved his hand in front of Tom’s eyes, saying: “Tom, are you okay?”

After being knocked out by Su Nantian, Tom subconsciously didn’t know he was on the boxing ring. Upon hearing someone ask him, he waved his hand.

“Now is the time to knock him down. Don’t waste time here,” Yuan Daying said to Su Nantian on the ring. Su Nantian was playing around with Tom, which made him anxious because from the beginning, Tom’s offensive momentum was very strong. If he gave him another chance to catch his breath, he feared the result might change.

After hearing this, Su Nantian looked at Yuan Daying and nodded. Since Yuan Daying had spoken, he would definitely follow.

So Su Nantian directly punched Tom’s stomach. This punch knocked Tom to the ground, and he lay there without getting up.

Seeing this situation, Su Nantian said to Lao Lai below: “How is the judgment?”

At this moment, He Zun suddenly stood up and said: “Let’s count by international rules. If Tom doesn’t get up after the count, it means he has lost.”

Yuan Daying nodded in agreement. Lao Lai saw this situation and realized he couldn’t oppose anymore.

Thus, the members of Haiwang Gang below started to cheer and count down. However, after they finished counting, Tom still didn’t get up from the ground. Even after hearing the last number of the count, he gave up struggling and lay there.

After Su Nantian saw Tom completely surrendering, he jumped down from the ring and walked to Yuan Daying’s side.

Yuan Daying looked at Su Nantian and nodded, then whispered: “Let’s talk later. I’ll handle this first.”

Su Nantian naturally nodded understandingly and stood behind Yuan Daying without speaking.

At this moment, Yuan Daying and He Zun were obviously in high spirits because they hadn’t expected the situation to turn so quickly. Before, they had never thought Su Nantian would win.

Because Tom’s initial attack was so fierce that they felt it was almost impossible for Su Nantian to win. But in the end, Su Nantian had defeated him with just one punch.

Yuan Daying smiled and looked at Lao Lai beside him, saying: “How about it, Lao Lai? Are you satisfied with the result? Our previous agreement still stands, right? If you change your mind, think carefully about what the consequences will be.”

As he said this, the members of Haiwang Gang beside him all looked fierce and waved their weapons toward Lao Lai.

In truth, if it were a real fight, Lao Lai’s side might not have been able to beat Yuan Daying. However, Yuan Daying and his group were doing business outside the area and didn’t want to offend other forces. So they wanted to resolve this issue in a more moderate way.

That was why they had arranged this match. If this incident happened in Ruohai District, Haiwang Gang would have directly used violent means.

Lao Lai knew he had truly lost and couldn’t afford to be stubborn. If he was stubborn, Haiwang Gang would have a legitimate reason to attack him.

Lao Lai nodded resignedly and said to Yuan Daying: “Okay, everything we agreed on still stands. Since you won the bar, I’ll give it to you. Also, the right to run underground boxing on this street will be yours. I won’t touch anything here and leave it intact, but I’ll take my people with me.”

After hearing Lao Lai’s words, Yuan Daying smiled and nodded: “Of course. Your people must leave. You can take your things too, as long as you leave this place.”

In fact, Yuan Daying didn’t care about the things in the bar. They already had a bar on this street, and everything was complete. Even if Lao Lai sabotaged the place and emptied it completely, they could restore it to its original state within a day without affecting subsequent operations.

But Lao Lai was obviously trying to do a favor, not wanting to be too confrontational with Yuan Daying. After all, they had lost, and according to the previous agreement and reason, they must hand over the bar to Yuan Daying. Since they had come this far, why not leave a good impression on Yuan Daying.

“No need for that. Leave the things to you. I’ll take all my people out. You can do whatever you want with it, as long as it continues to operate tonight. From now on, this bar has nothing to do with me, Lao Lai.”

After saying that, Lao Lai turned to his subordinates behind him and said: “Alright, we’ve lost fairly. This base is now given to others. From now on, this territory belongs to Big Eagle Brother. None of our people are allowed to cause trouble here. No one is allowed to enter this bar freely. If you want to come, just treat yourselves as customers. If anyone causes trouble here in the future, even I won’t protect them. I’ve said everything. Let’s go!”

After saying this, Lao Lai led his subordinates out of the bar and truly took everyone out, handing over the bar intact to Yuan Daying’s group.

Chapter 542: Fulfilling the Promise

After seeing Lao Lai’s people leave the bar, Su Nantian knew this matter was over. However, his issue with Yuan Daying and his group wasn’t finished yet. Even though he had helped Yuan Daying win this bet, it didn’t necessarily mean he would get what he wanted from them.

Moreover, there was He Zun beside Yuan Daying. This person had more tricks than Yuan Daying, so Su Nantian needed to convince him to achieve his goal.

At this moment, Yuan Daying looked at the empty bar and laughed loudly. He knew the rules of their group well. He understood that Lao Lai’s departure wasn’t a temporary strategy but truly giving up the bar. After all, they had signed an agreement before, so if Lao Lai changed his mind, it would certainly cause others to look down on him.

“Everyone, hurry and prepare. Check what things here can be used directly. Try to get this bar running normally tonight, but stop the underground boxing ring. Tell anyone who comes that they can only watch at our place.”

He Zun immediately started deploying his subordinates to begin operations tonight.

Su Nantian had also checked the conditions of this bar. If there were enough service staff, everything was ready. He thought it was possible to start operating tonight.

Thus, the members of Haiwang Gang started moving around inside and outside the bar, striving to get it running normally tonight.

Although they knew internally that this place had changed hands, the customers didn’t know about these twists and turns. They might be confused why some familiar faces had disappeared.

In fact, the income from this bar wasn’t particularly high compared to underground boxing. But having such a bar as an alternative was indeed a good choice for Yuan Daying and He Zun. From now on, there would be no other underground boxing ring on this street, giving them a monopoly over the business.

Su Nantian thought that since Yuan Daying hadn’t approached him yet, he wouldn’t go to him. He just waited for Yuan Daying to remember this matter and call him over.

After all, from Su Nantian’s current position, he was still weak against Haiwang Gang. Especially since the first thing Haiwang Gang would do now was to tidy up this bar, not pay attention to him.

After some time passed, Yuan Daying finally remembered Su Nantian.

Yuan Daying walked over with a smile and patted his shoulder, saying: “Young man, I didn’t expect your skills to be so good. This bar we obtained today is truly thanks to you.”

Yuan Daying was obviously happy now, having defeated a competitor. His heart was naturally delighted. Moreover, they had initially thought they had no chance of winning, but Su Nantian had turned the situation around.

Su Nantian smiled at Yuan Daying and said: “Then, can you fulfill your promise to me now?”

Yuan Daying was taken aback but smiled and said: “Of course. You wanted the Southern Palace to withdraw from Ruohai District, right? I promised you that. The profit you brought me today is much more than what I asked the Southern Palace for. Moreover, as someone who has been in this business for many years, even though Haiwang Gang solves problems with fists, I will keep my promise to you.”

After Yuan Daying agreed, Su Nantian finally felt relieved. However, it wasn’t completely reassuring until they could truly withdraw from here.

Because in this matter, Su Nantian cared more about He Zun’s attitude than Yuan Daying’s. He knew that He Zun was like a strategist in Haiwang Gang, and Yuan Daying trusted him greatly. Even when He Zun had said some harsh words to Yuan Daying earlier, he hadn’t taken it seriously. This showed their relationship.

Therefore, if He Zun kept whispering in Yuan Daying’s ear, Su Nantian’s plan might fail.

“Then, when can we withdraw? Also, what about the other thing you mentioned earlier—was it still valid?” Su Nantian continued to ask cautiously. After all, besides solving the Southern Palace issue, he also needed to plan for his own scheme.

Su Nantian thought he could use Haiwang Gang’s advantage in the capital to develop an intelligence network, which could coordinate with the secret assassin organization.

Moreover, in the capital, this weak Ruohai District was uncontrolled and given entirely to Haiwang Gang. This was a huge advantage. If he could develop this area, the profit would definitely be more than just now.

But Yuan Daying hadn’t thought about developing Ruohai District yet. He only treated it as his base, which was a waste of such good conditions.

Yuan Daying listened to Su Nantian’s words and was a bit confused. He scratched his head and said: “What else? What other things do you have?”

“You’re a man of great fortune and forgetfulness. Do you remember what you said to me earlier? If I win, from now on I’ll be your brother in Haiwang Gang. Did you forget that?” Su Nantian smiled and said, speaking to Yuan Daying without the slightest fear.

In fact, Yuan Daying had always been curious about Su Nantian’s attitude. Whenever he met others, they would show fear. Even some of Haiwang Gang’s subordinates showed this when meeting him alone, but Su Nantian was completely fearless. Now he could even smile and talk to him while negotiating terms.

“You helped us today, so I’ll keep my promise. But don’t overstep. I do acknowledge that you are now a brother of Haiwang Gang, but if I let you stay here, would you stay?”

Yuan Daying said this with a serious face. He could clearly sense Su Nantian’s demands, so he felt that if Su Nantian wanted to use them for something, he wouldn’t give him face.

Chapter 543: Goal Achieved

Su Nantian knew he wouldn’t easily get anything from Yuan Daying. Although Yuan Daying looked rough on the surface, he had many ideas inside.

So Su Nantian smiled and said: “I don’t expect to get anything from you. I just feel that if you truly consider me a brother, it feels good.”

“If you genuinely want to be my brother, we naturally welcome you. After all, the biggest hero today is you. Your contribution to Haiwang Gang is immeasurable. But if you have other intentions, we won’t be a group that just follows orders. We’ve already repaid your kindness.”

Yuan Daying’s attitude was firm. He felt that if Su Nantian wanted to use them for something, he wouldn’t agree.

“I just want you to make sure the Southern Palace leaves this place. When can they completely withdraw?” Su Nantian saw Yuan Daying’s strong attitude and realized he wasn’t a good time to push. Although he really wanted to use Haiwang Gang’s advantage to do something, now it seemed Yuan Daying was very alert.

Moreover, this time Su Nantian and Yuan Daying were equal in exchange. He had beaten the bet for him, and in return, Yuan Daying gave him the Southern Palace’s withdrawal from Ruohai District. Beyond that, if he asked for more, it would be too hasty. However, since he had connected with Yuan Daying, there was no need to worry about future opportunities.

Moreover, for Su Nantian, the immediate priority was returning to the Southern Palace and finding a chance to contact the Wu family to rescue Wu You’er and Wu Tao.

As for Haiwang Gang, it could be postponed. If he could gain a little favor from Yuan Daying, it would be easier to reconnect in the future.

“I’ll have He Zun write something for you. You can take it back today and tell those people in Ruohai District they can leave. As for the Southern Palace, we won’t ask them for a penny anymore. Are you satisfied with this?” Yuan Daying said to Su Nantian.
