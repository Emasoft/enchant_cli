“Do you think only you’re a wimp? None of us have ever suffered such humiliation!”

At this moment, another villain interrupted him. When they spoke, their expressions turned furious, recalling how Su Nantian had bound them and threatened to feed them to wild beasts. They could not remain calm.

“They must know the consequences of offending us!”

After thinking about this, the villains gritted their teeth and spoke these words with hatred. Their expressions could not maintain composure.

“But that guy isn’t someone easy to deal with. He’s also no pushover. Look at how we, even together, were defeated by him!”

Thinking of this, the villains fell silent again.

Because they had all witnessed Su Nantian’s strength firsthand. Now, when mentioning his abilities, it was as if they remembered how he had boasted before them.

They felt both anger and fear, with two of them involuntarily swallowing saliva.

“Spit! He was so arrogant in front of us. What’s there to fear? There are people beyond this small village, and the sky has its own limits. Do you really think such a tiny village could produce someone great?”

At this moment, A Hao spoke reluctantly. These words clearly belittled Su Nantian.

“We just haven’t trained, and that’s why we lost to this martial artist. If we find dozens of fighters, even if their strength isn’t as great as Su Nantian’s, we can still outnumber him!”

At this point, A Hao spoke again, thinking that if they couldn’t beat Su Nantian, they would find more than double the number. Even if their strength wasn’t as formidable as his, at least they could overwhelm him in numbers.

“If we gather dozens of people to beat him up, we’ll scare the courage out of him. That way, he won’t dare to be so arrogant in front of us anymore!”

At this thought, the others also showed expressions of agreement.

“You’re right, Brother A Hao. We lost face today. If we had been more careful or if there were more of us, that guy wouldn’t have dared to be so arrogant!”

The other villains nodded in agreement, supporting this idea.

It seemed as if they were trying to deceive themselves by repeating these words several times.

When A Hao heard everyone agree with his idea, he immediately spoke up and issued orders: “Then it’s settled. You all go back and find people. Bring in everyone capable of fighting within a few dozen miles. We’ll regroup tomorrow and go to the small fishing village to deal with that brat. He won’t get off easily!”

A Hao thought for a moment before instructing everyone.

Others had no objections, as they still remembered the humiliation and disgrace they had suffered. Thus, they also wanted to give Su Nantian a lesson.

After dealing with Su Nantian, they could continue to swagger around this area without anyone daring to bother them.

“Good! That’s settled. You all hurry and find people. We’ll meet tomorrow and strike him by surprise!”

As A Hao thought of this, his eyes gradually turned sinister.

He was already impatient to deal with Su Nantian.

A Hao also thought of how Su Nantian had beaten them and left such an arrogant threat.

Chapter 780: Secret Schemes

Moreover, Su Nantian had said that if they appeared again, he would kill them and make them return all the stolen goods to the villagers.

How could such a thing happen? If they actually did this, where would their dignity be?

They couldn’t afford to lose face.

Furthermore, if they actually did this, it would mean they were truly afraid of Su Nantian.

At this thought, A Hao was unwilling to do it.

The other villains were also proud and had been spoiled since childhood, never having suffered a loss or been bullied by anyone.

Therefore, they could not agree with this approach.

Thus, these villains had already silently discussed and found a way to deal with Su Nantian again. They were preparing to act together, seeking trouble for Su Nantian and eventually flattening the small fishing village so that no one would dare to be so arrogant again.

At the same time, the Xu family was not idle.

In S City’s Xu family, in the council hall.

Madam Xu still sat at the top of the hierarchy, her position clearly showing her supreme status within the Xu family.

“Ahai, how is it going? What progress have you made with the task I assigned?”

Madam Xu’s gaze was calm. She first glanced at everyone before giving them a brief look, then returned her attention and spoke in a deep voice.

The matter she referred to was investigating Su Nantian.

The one called Ahai was her first son, Xu Hai.

Upon hearing Madam Xu’s command, Xu Hai did not dare to be careless and immediately answered.

“Mother, I have made progress. I’ve thoroughly investigated Su Nantian and found no flaws.”

Xu Hai respectfully replied, his attitude toward Madam Xu was not like that of a mother and son but rather like a subordinate reporting to his superior.

After saying this, Xu Hai compiled the information he had gathered into a file and pushed it toward Madam Xu.

Then, Xu Hai explained: “However, Su Nantian has no remarkable qualities. He is just a person from a small village, an orphan with no parents and all his relatives have died. In this sense, Su Nantian seems like a star of calamity, and everyone connected to him has met with misfortune.”

Xu Hai explained while reporting.

Madam Xu flipped through the file and examined it carefully, looking up at Xu Hai as she did so. “You’re wrong. If his background were truly that simple, how could he have such formidable abilities?”

Madam Xu referred to Su Nantian’s ability when he had confronted Wu Chuan.

Indeed, not only did the security personnel find it astonishing, but the entire Xu family had also been impressed by Su Nantian’s abilities.

If it weren’t for the fact that Su Nantian stood against them, Madam Xu would have wanted to recruit him.

It was a pity.

“Mother’s words are correct. It was my oversight.”

Upon hearing Madam Xu’s words, Xu Hai did not argue but instead accepted them respectfully.

After that, Xu Hai said: “I will continue to investigate. This time I’ll dig deeper and find all related matters.”

Xu Hai said this, then lowered his head waiting for Madam Xu’s instructions.

“Good, I believe in your abilities. Do as you think fit,”

Madam Xu was not a harsh person and knew that someone with Su Nantian’s abilities would have hidden his background well. Therefore, she did not rush her son.

Speaking of Su Nantian, Madam Xu then inquired about Wu Chuan.

“Ah Rong.”

This time, Madam Xu called her second son, Xu Rong.

“Yes, Mother.”

Upon hearing Madam Xu’s call, Xu Rong responded immediately. His attitude was the same as his elder brother Xu Hai, showing great respect.

They seemed more like subordinates and superiors rather than family members. There was no warmth or harmony in their interactions.

Xu Rong responded to his mother’s call and waited for her instructions.

Madam Xu pondered for a moment before continuing: “What about the situation with the Wu family? Wu Chuan was their only person who could speak, but now that he’s out of the way, there is no one to take over. After all, inland port has a group of wolves and tigers always watching the Wu family. These people are all eager to grab a piece of the pie.”

“Mother, they haven’t taken any action yet. However, the Wu family’s situation isn’t good either. After Wu Chuan fell, others were watching them closely, and the projects he had seized were almost completely divided.”

At this point, Xu Rong sighed regretfully.

Although they had no close relationship with their nephew, they still acknowledged his abilities and strategies.

Moreover, Wu Chuan’s style was more like that of the Xu family.

Therefore, seeing Wu Chuan die and his life’s work in business almost entirely taken over by others, Xu Rong felt a strange sense of regret and sorrow.

“Then we should take over.”

At this moment, Madam Xu spoke directly, and her words shocked everyone. Those present all looked up at Madam Xu in surprise.

“Mother, but that’s the Wu family, not our Xu family. Although Wu Chuan was once in charge, power could never belong to us.”

Xu Rong raised his objection at this point and believed that the Wu family, who had been in charge before, would certainly have many grievances.

Although now it was just outsiders managing them, at least they were Wu family members.

This had nothing to do with the Xu family.

Moreover, how could those people entrust their family business to an outsider?

Considering these issues, Xu Rong raised his objection.

After saying this, Xu Rong quickly turned to look at Madam Xu, waiting for her next words.

At the same time, he felt a little nervous, fearing that Madam Xu would think he was incompetent and had already started making excuses to avoid responsibility.

Thinking of this, Xu Rong involuntarily swallowed saliva.

At this moment, Madam Xu only looked at Xu Rong for a moment before continuing: “I believe in your abilities. A small Wu family is nothing, and now they are just a disorganized group with no one who can speak.”

Chapter 781: Timing

“Ah Rong, this is truly the perfect time to strike.”

Madam Xu spoke with a meaningful tone and instructed Xu Rong.

After saying this instruction, she did not wait for Xu Rong to refuse but instead made a final decision: “Ah Rong, I’m waiting for your good news. I believe you won’t disappoint me.”

“I… this…”

Xu Rong spoke the word “I” and then paused.

He understood Madam Xu’s meaning, so he continued to answer: “Mother, I understand. I will do my best.”

Since Madam Xu had already said this much, Xu Rong knew she would not change her mind. Since she could not change it, he could only do his best.

Therefore, Xu Rong did not continue to refuse but immediately answered and made a promise.

“Good, that’s my good son.”

Madam Xu praised Xu Rong and looked at him with satisfaction.

She nodded to Xu Rong, and when she said this, her gaze also swept over the other two sons.

Madam Xu’s words were actually double-edged, reminding Xu Hai and the others to remember her words.

After finishing their tasks, Madam Xu began to speak about the family’s official matters.

Everyone was also fully attentive and listened carefully to Madam Xu’s instructions, with no one daring to oppose her.

On the other hand, Xu Xiangning went to Hongye’s place to ask for help. After returning, she was constantly anxious and waited for news.

After some time without any feedback from Hongye, Xu Xiangling became even more anxious. So she thought again and decided to go find Hongye herself.

Xu Xiangning wanted to directly probe Hongye for any new discoveries, otherwise she would be anxious and restless, with no moment of peace.

However, Xu Xiangning was unlucky this time. When she arrived at the villa area, she found out that Hongye had gone out to do business and would be back in a while.

“Hongye went out for business? Why didn’t anyone inform me?”

Upon hearing this answer, Xu Xiangning immediately felt defeated and was also upset. She frowned and questioned the guard at the door.

The guard only gave Xu Xiangning an expression of helplessness: “Madam Xu, I’m really sorry. Hongye’s work never involves us. We can’t do anything about it.”

After saying these words, the guard also did not forget to comfort Xu Xiangning’s emotions: “But Madam Xu, don’t worry. As soon as Hongye returns, we will immediately inform you. Hongye is busy with matters and hasn’t had time to tell Madam Xu yet.”

“Okay, I understand! Remember that when Hongye returns, you must inform me immediately!”

Xu Xiangning’s mood improved a little but still had many grievances.

However, Xu Xiangning was not completely foolish; she knew how to be reasonable and did not want to push too hard, otherwise the only person who could help her would run away because of her.

Therefore, Xu Xiangning had to suppress her inner grievances and went back directly.

Xu Xiangning did not know that she had just turned away, and the Hongye who was said to be out of town slowly came out of his room.

He stood at the balcony, looking mysterious and deep, watching Xu Xiangning’s back as she walked away. After a while, Hongye showed an enigmatic expression and then smiled slightly, almost looking down on Xu Xiangning.

“Hongye.”

At this moment, the housekeeper came out from behind Hongye. He carefully observed Hongye’s expression before asking: “Hongye, why didn’t you meet Madam Xu?”

Although Hongye had previously been very enthusiastic towards her, it was only a few days ago. Now he seemed to have grown tired and did not want to see Xu Xiangning at all.

This was extremely strange, and the housekeeper also had many questions.

Upon hearing this, Hongye took out a cigar and took a slow puff before exhaling the smoke.

Hongye did not answer immediately but first looked at the leaves below the building before speaking to the housekeeper: “You are truly too young. You don’t know how to manipulate women or control your own assets.”

Hongye paused for a moment before continuing: “What would happen if I always fulfilled her requests every time she came?”

“She would naturally be grateful to Hongye.”

The housekeeper was still naive. Upon hearing Hongye’s question, he immediately said what he thought without hesitation.

But upon hearing this, Hongye only smiled and slowly shook his head: “No, she would think it was natural. Then later, she would constantly demand more from me. If once I failed to fulfill her dream goal, she would be disappointed in me and even angry with me, thinking I owed her.”

“Ah, is there really such a person?”

The housekeeper looked at Hongye in surprise, clearly not expecting this.

Hongye smiled meaningfully: “Of course there are. Otherwise, what would I be doing by dangling Xu Xiangning?”

After saying this, Hongye took another casual puff of his cigar and did not explain further to the housekeeper.

But Hongye was still thinking about how he had already understood Xu Xiangning.

Although he wanted to use Xu Xiangning and also wanted to use the Xu family, he knew how to proceed gradually so that the prey would be lured into his trap step by step.

Therefore, Hongye also needed to balance and set boundaries so that Xu Xiangning could not see him every time she wanted.

Moreover, Hongye knew that Xu Xiangning was so eager to find him because of that matter.

Because of this, Hongye could not let her always get what she wanted.

Hongye definitely needed to show off his authority and make Xu Xiangning return in a hurry, making her so anxious that she would almost foam at the mouth.

Only then could he reveal his information, making it more valuable and showing himself as more important.

After thinking of these things, Hongye’s expression became even more enigmatic and complex.

He was now waiting for the best timing to reveal everything he knew.

On the other hand, although the housekeeper still did not understand Hongye’s words or his intentions, he did not ask further questions because he saw that Hongye had no intention of continuing.

This also proved that the housekeeper knew how to step back, and it was because of this personality and habit that he had stayed with Hongye for so long.

Chapter 782: Knowing When to Advance and Retreat

This was the housekeeper’s strength, which was also why he could stay with Hongye.

Unlike others who did not last a few days before being dismissed by Hongye, they were secretly executed.

Of course, as a good subordinate, the housekeeper knew what he needed to do: when it was time to be deaf, he had to be deaf; when it was time to be blind, he had to be blind.

He must not be curious about what should not be heard, seen, or asked.

And when it was time for him to play his role, he must fully demonstrate his value.

That was what a subordinate should do.

The next day, Su Nantian calmly went through the day as usual. He would check on the villagers’ health and teach them to identify simple herbs.

If there was any remaining time, he would go fishing with Uncle Wang, using his unique method to make it easier and catch more fish.

Every night, Su Nantian would go to the backyard to absorb the essence of the sun and moon, as well as celestial energy. Although he had no idea why he felt this way or developed this habit, his intuition told him it was beneficial.

And since he had not noticed any negative effects, he continued this daily practice.

“Sigh.”

Compared to Su Nantian’s calmness, Uncle Wang was more worried and anxious. Every time he saw Su Nantian, he would sigh and shake his head.

“Uncle Wang, don’t worry. I’m here to take care of everything. There will be no problems.”

Su Nantian could no longer ignore Uncle Wang’s behavior. He sighed tiredly and told him not to worry so much.

But Uncle Wang still shook his head and said the same thing he had said before about Su Nantian: “You’re still too young.”

At this point, Uncle Wang paused before continuing: “I know you have good intentions to help the villagers of the small fishing village. But think about it: these villains have been bullying for years in nearby villages. If they don’t have confidence, we could unite the villagers of several villages to deal with them.”

Uncle Wang spoke earnestly: “It’s because their background is not ordinary that we must be careful. Everyone has been trying to endure and live quietly, but now you’ve scared them with one threat. They won’t easily let this go.”

At this point, Uncle Wang’s expression became even more worried.

He knew Su Nantian was too young and impetuous.

“But Uncle Wang…”

When Su Nantian heard Uncle Wang say this, he understood Uncle Wang’s feelings. After all, they had lived in this way for many years and now he had suddenly broken through the bottleneck. This made Uncle Wang feel worried and uneasy.

But seeing Uncle Wang being oppressed by these villains for years and still choosing to endure, Su Nantian felt he couldn’t agree.

After all, people who are kind are often taken advantage of; horses that are kind are often ridden.

And the villagers of the small fishing village had been so passive, which was why these villains were so arrogant and without limits.

“Don’t worry, since this problem started because of me and I provoked these villains, I will take full responsibility. I’ll stay here waiting for them. If they dare to come back, I will give them a harsh lesson and make sure they never dare to trouble us again!”

Su Nantian’s resolute promise comforted Uncle Wang and made him stop worrying so much.

When Uncle Wang heard Su Nantian say this, his expression did not become lighter but instead remained unchanged. He still shook his head and disagreed with Su Nantian’s plan.

But Uncle Wang did not continue to persuade Su Nantian, knowing that Su Nantian had a different opinion.

No matter what he said, Su Nantian would still stick to his own ideas.

After thinking about this, Uncle Wang raised his hand and patted Su Nantian’s shoulder without saying anything more.

Su Nantian, because of Uncle Wang’s words, fell into silence.

Had he been too impulsive? Had he made a mistake?

Uncle Wang and the others had lived in this small fishing village for many years, so they were used to this lifestyle. They didn’t mind being troubled by villains.

Would his sudden interference bring problems the village had never faced before?

At this thought, Su Nantian became more hesitant. He was troubled and worried whether he had acted out of his own selfishness, dragging these villagers into trouble.

But when Su Nantian thought about how these villains had been so arrogant and had harmed Xiao Chen for years, he felt it was improper to give them no lesson.

That was why Su Nantian felt distressed.

After thinking for a while, Su Nantian still couldn’t find an answer or a reason to convince himself.

Never mind.

He sighed again, thinking that if the enemy came, he would meet them head-on; if water came, he would block it with earth.

Moreover, the villains had been scared by him yesterday and might not dare to come back again.

Su Nantian believed they wouldn’t dare to be so impolite again.

Of course, if these people insisted on coming back, Su Nantian wouldn’t mind giving them a lesson and making them realize his strength.

After thinking through what to do next, Su Nantian’s expression softened a little and his mood was no longer so heavy.

He looked up at Uncle Wang’s direction.

Uncle Wang was still organizing his fishing nets, but even with his head down, he couldn’t hide the worry radiating from him.

But Su Nantian had already made up his mind. He would definitely not let the villains continue to harm the people of the small fishing village.

After thinking about this, Su Nantian no longer dwelled on the issue.

He thought that since he was still in the village, if they came back, he would know first.

After Su Nantian had made his plan for the next step, he no longer worried.

Su Nantian even thought it would be better if these villains had the courage to come back. If they didn’t follow his orders, Su Nantian would definitely carry out his threat and not let them off easily.

After thinking clearly, Su Nantian looked again at the direction of Uncle Wang’s room.

Su Nantian clenched his fist and silently told himself, he would definitely protect Uncle Wang and all the villagers of the small fishing village.

At this thought, Su Nantian’s expression became even more determined.

These promises were all his true feelings.

Chapter 783: Villains Come to Visit

They really did return!

And this time, they came with great momentum and arrived earlier than Su Nantian had anticipated.

This time the villains stormed into the small fishing village like a wave, sweeping through every corner without leaving any place untouched.

And this time they seemed to have their secret weapon, with everyone’s faces showing fearlessness and arrogance. They also carried a firm determination to teach Su Nantian a lesson.

The villagers of the small fishing village were quite familiar with these villains. When they suddenly appeared in their village, everyone was shocked.

They all stopped working, and many women hurried to find their husbands so they wouldn’t be harmed by these villains.

“What do you want?”

After receiving the news, the old village head also hurried over.

When he saw these villains, his face turned cold and he walked forward with a cane, trembling slightly.

He looked at the leader of the villains and said fearlessly: “This is the small fishing village. We don’t welcome you!”

“Yes, yes!”

Other villagers also came forward to support the old village head and protect him.

At this moment, the old village head asked A Hao: “Earlier you said that we should pay protection money according to the rules. We all paid it, now you can’t break the rules and come into our village!”

When he said this, the old village head took his cane and firmly slammed it on the ground to try to scare away these villains.

And he bravely told them: “Rules are rules. You shouldn’t bully people so much. Our small fishing village’s people are kind and honest, but we’re not cowards. You should know that when pushed to the edge, even a rabbit will bite!”

While saying this, he also stepped forward and looked at the villains without backing down.

“Haha, that’s true. The people of your village have mostly cooperated with us. But a single rat can spoil the whole pot. Do you think this pot is still worth keeping?”

At this moment, the villain sneered and looked at the old village head with arrogance. He didn’t show any care for the elderly man but instead treated him rudely and completely disregarded his presence.

“What… what do you mean?”

When the old village head heard the villains say this, he looked at them confusedly and wanted an answer.

At this moment, the villains had no intention of explaining but immediately changed their attitude and said harshly: “You don’t know? Well, you’ll find out soon. Then you won’t say we’ve bullied you! All the blame will fall on that person!”

After saying this, the villains pushed aside the old village head without hesitation. They completely ignored that he was an elderly man.

The old village head, being old and weak, trembled with his cane. Now pushed by them, he immediately fell to the ground in a pitiful state.

The villagers saw the old village head pushed by the villains and immediately rushed to help him up: “Village Head, are you okay?”

They asked the old village head with concern. Seeing he was fine, they glared at these villains angrily.

They had always said they would pay protection money, and the villagers already disliked them greatly. Now seeing them push the old village head without hesitation, the villagers felt even more hatred for these villains.

“Get out! Get out! This is our village!”

The villagers also gathered their courage and fought back.

They had endured enough of these villains’ arrogance before, but now seeing them not even sparing the old village head, they were more angry.

With one villager standing up first, others also rushed forward.

They tried to block these villains from entering the village. From their actions, it was clear that the villagers had finally gathered courage and dared to fight back against these villains for the first time!

“Hey? Good!”

The villains were startled by the villagers’ resistance and immediately let out a cold laugh: “You’re really rebelling! Daring to resist!”

“Yesterday when I saw that stinkard, I knew the people of this small fishing village were not peaceful. I didn’t expect their tails would show so quickly! Want to rebel, huh? Then you have to ask my people if they agree!”

After saying this, the villain clapped his hands twice. Then from the two long vans behind them, the doors were immediately opened and dozens of strong fighters rushed out.

And these people had weapons in their hands, looking fierce with facial features and appearing to be no good company. They were more dangerous than these villains.

The fighters held weapons and glared at the villagers, as if a big shark had suddenly appeared in the small fishing village. It was scary.

The villagers of the small fishing village had not expected that these villains would have brought reinforcements!

And they were all strong men who looked like no good company. The villagers were scared and stopped their actions, looking at the villains’ direction with fear and not daring to move.

The villain saw that the villagers had stopped moving, then let out a triumphant laugh: “Rebel? Why aren’t you rebelling now? You were so energetic before. Did you want to drive me out of your village?”

These people are like this; if they don’t get a taste of their own medicine, they won’t remember who they are.

The leader A Hao spoke arrogantly without looking at these villagers.

Not only that, but he also constantly mocked the villagers: “If you’re smart, stay to the side and kneel. If your bones are hard, I won’t mind letting them loosen up your joints!”

After saying this, the villain looked back at the fighters he had brought.

The fighters immediately cooperated by swinging their steel pipes and lightly tapping them on their hands to scare the villagers.

Indeed, seeing this fierce attitude of theirs, the villagers gasped in fear and stopped moving forward.

But if they followed the villains’ advice to kneel and beg, their dignity would not allow them to do so. Therefore, the villagers hesitated but stood there vigilantly watching the villains.

The villagers clung to each other tightly, although they were scared, they did not show it on their faces.

Chapter 784: Venting

“Now no one listens to what I say, right? Good! Good! Since I spoke kindly and you didn’t listen, then you must be ready to bear my anger!”

The villain was not a good-tempered person. Plus, he had been beaten by Su Nantian yesterday and threatened, losing both face and dignity. He had accumulated a lot of anger.

Now seeing these villagers not listening to him and beginning to resist, the villain became even angrier.

He snapped his fingers and said this sentence before signaling the fighters to give the villagers a small lesson.

“Go on, hit them, but be careful not to kill anyone!”

The reason the villain said this was definitely not out of mercy for these villagers or fear of taking responsibility for a death. It was because Su Nantian had not appeared yet, and this key moment must be saved for when Su Nantian arrived.

After all, it would have more impact then, especially seeing Su Nantian begging on his knees before them.

The thought of that scene made the villains feel good.

The fighters were hired to do this job, so they naturally followed their master’s orders.

Upon hearing the villain say this, they had no objections.

The fighters picked up their weapons and moved forward. The villagers were startled by their posture and retreated.

After all, they were just ordinary people without any fighting skills. Against these professional fighters, how could they possibly win?

The villagers quickly protected the old village head and retreated so that he wouldn’t be hit.

One young man was more clever, taking advantage of the fighters’ lesson to the villagers and quickly ran to Uncle Wang’s house.

After all, besides the old village head, the oldest person in the village was Uncle Wang. When they had problems, people instinctively went to him for help.

This young man also had this idea and accidentally found the key person, Su Nantian.

“What?”

Upon hearing the young man’s urgent explanation, Su Nantian's face immediately changed. His aura and demeanor also shifted.

Upon hearing the report, Uncle Wang was also stunned.

“They really did come…”

After saying this, Uncle Wang looked at Su Nantian with a look of frustration. It wasn’t blame but rather that he felt he hadn’t listened to his advice, and indeed had brought these troubles back.

At this moment, Su Nantian didn’t have time to explain. He knew what Uncle Wang’s look meant and could only apologize with a glance at him before saying to Uncle Wang: “Stay here with Xiao Wang. I’ll go with him.”
