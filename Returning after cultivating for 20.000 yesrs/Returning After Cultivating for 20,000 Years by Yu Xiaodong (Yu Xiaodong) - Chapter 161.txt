A Hao felt even more terrified. He believed that Su Nantian had no leisure to play with him, so his face turned even paler and devoid of all color.

"If you let me go, I'll give you money—lots and lots of it! Is that acceptable?"

A Hao suddenly thought of a plan, gazing desperately at Su Nantian, hoping he would let him off.

It was said that money could move even ghosts to grind millstones, especially for someone like Su Nantian, a small village resident. He might be extremely materialistic; perhaps A Hao had guessed correctly and Su Nantian would indeed let him go.

With this thought, A Hao's eyes held a full measure of hope, yearning for Su Nantian to quickly give him an answer.

"Money?"

At this moment, Su Nantian spoke softly, repeating A Hao's words. His face, however, bore no expression.

Then Su Nantian stared at A Hao without any emotion, his tone unchanged.

"How much money do you plan to give me? Or rather, how much do you think you're worth?"

Su Nantian continued his taunts in response to A Hao's begging.

A Hao had no idea Su Nantian was mocking him, thinking that his plea might succeed. He exhaled a quiet breath of relief before gazing desperately at Su Nantian again.

A flicker of hope also arose in his heart.

He implored Su Nantian to let him go.

But when A Hao calculated how much he should pay Su Nantian to buy his name, Su Nantian did not give him a chance to speak again.

"Have you taken me for what?" Su Nantian sneered, his voice cold and chilling enough to raise every hair on one's body.

"Did you think everyone was like you?"

Su Nantian spoke without mercy, piercing A Hao's arrogance with a single blow.

After this, Su Nantian paused for a moment before cruelly adding: "No, not quite. You are despicable, a scum of the earth."

After saying this, Su Nantian's gaze turned even colder. He gave A Hao no further glance at all.

A Hao was scolded mercilessly, yet he dared not breathe a word. He was terrified beyond measure and knew Su Nantian was cursing him, but he dared not challenge him for fear of being killed.

"Li Ge, what are you going to do?"

At this moment, Xiao Chen approached Su Nantian. He first glared at A Hao kneeling on the ground before lowering his voice, speaking only for them to hear.

"Li Ge, are we going to return the same treatment to him?"

Xiao Chen lowered his voice again. Originally, when he heard A Hao's attempt to bribe Su Nantian with money, his heart had given a jolt.

Though he knew Su Nantian would not be swayed by five measures of rice, he still worried that A Hao's offer might entice Su Nantian.

But fortunately, Su Nantian had not faltered at all and had given A Hao no opportunity. He coldly uttered this sentence, effectively dousing A Hao's last hope with a bucket of water.

The atmosphere in the alley grew heavier, fear and unease enveloping A Hao entirely.

Though he could not hear Su Nantian's conversation with Xiao Chen, in this situation, it did not hinder his guesses.

A Hao felt that he was truly in dire straits and had no escape. Su Nantian would definitely not let him go easily. Just thinking about this, A Hao turned pale and dared not breathe a word.

Those small henchmen by A Hao's side had originally thought this matter was unrelated to them. But now, infected by the atmosphere of the scene, they were also thoroughly panicked.

Each of their hearts beat rapidly and their faces looked terrible. They exchanged glances, unsure of the situation or what had happened.

They glanced at Su Nantian and then looked at A Hao kneeling beside them, instantly realizing they had encountered a formidable figure.

They had lived here for so long and committed various petty crimes daily, yet they had never seen a person like Su Nantian.

Thus, at this moment, they were thoroughly panicked. No one dared to oppose Su Nantian's group or even think of resistance.

At this moment, two of the small henchmen exchanged a glance before quickly explaining to Su Nantian, trying to gain his forgiveness.

"This matter has nothing to do with us at all. We don't know him. This was entirely Hao Ge's plan, and it has nothing to do with us. We were merely hired by him to fight, but we hadn't even started yet. You can't blame us, can you?"

The henchmen were afraid of getting involved in trouble and quickly distanced themselves, shifting all the blame onto A Hao.

Indeed, this was a perfect example of "when disaster strikes, everyone flees."

After saying this, they quickly begged Su Nantian: "Li Ge, please let us go! We'll never do this again!"

Saying this, they turned to look at Xiao Chen and Chen Xiaoling: "Please also plead for us! We haven't even started fighting yet!"

Chapter 805: Begging for Mercy

"We are merely accomplices! Please let us go!"

After saying this, the henchmen looked at Su Nantian with hope, hoping he would let them go.

Unfortunately, Su Nantian ignored their words as if he hadn't heard them. Not only did he not let them go, but he didn’t even give them a single glance.

These henchmen had only hoped to gamble, so they said these things to Su Nantian.

Now that they saw Su Nantian had no intention of responding and was not going to let them go, and seeing that Su Nantian had now suppressed all his emotions, looking even more serious.

They dared not speak anymore, fearing they would anger Su Nantian and become the first victim of today.

After they all fell silent, Su Nantian's expression slightly softened.

He had always believed that either you don't do it, but if you do it, you should be brave enough to admit it. It was not about begging for mercy and trying to play on sympathy to get the opponent to let you go.

People like A Hao and these henchmen were always those Su Nantian looked down upon.

Moreover, today's people had truly opened his eyes; he had never known that one could switch so freely between arrogance and cowardice.

"Xiao Chen."

Su Nantian felt that looking at these people would defile his eyes, so he quickly withdrew his gaze from them.

Su Nantian turned to Xiao Chen and asked in a low voice: "What do you suggest for teaching these people a lesson?"

Although killing them was just one move by Su Nantian, the situation had not yet reached that point. Su Nantian was not about to kill them and cause himself trouble.

Therefore, he intended to give them a lesson so they would remember it well.

It was best if they never dared to appear before him again in the future.

"What should we do?"

Xiao Chen, upon hearing Su Nantian's words, immediately fell into deep thought. However, after pondering for a while, he still had no idea and soon showed an expression of frustration.

"What should we do?"

Xiao Chen had only intended to scare these bullies at first. His purpose was to warn them and give them the punishment they deserved.

Moreover, as a simple fisherman like Xiao Chen, if he were truly asked to kill these people, he would never be able to do it and could not accept such a thing.

At this moment, Chen Xiaoling also fell into deep thought and was at a loss for words.

"Ah! I've got it!"

At this moment, Xiao Chen suddenly shouted and his face showed an excited joy: "Li Ge, I've thought of a good way to punish them!"

"Oh?"

Su Nantian raised his eyebrows, curious about what Xiao Chen had to say.

They were so happy that those at the end of the alley, A Hao and his group, felt even more anxious.

They could not tell what Su Nantian's plan was and their faces were filled with worry and fear.

A Hao's anxious feelings were clearly visible on his face, completely uncontrollable.

"What are you going to do to me?"

A Hao felt even more afraid, his body trembling more violently.

A Hao saw Xiao Chen whispering something into Su Nantian's ear, but their voices were so low and soft that only they could hear. A Hao had not understood a word.

Moreover, after they finished discussing, Xiao Chen approached him with a sly smile, which made A Hao unable to avoid fear.

"Don't worry; I won't kill you or beat you."

Xiao Chen smiled again, rubbing his hands together as he slowly approached. He said this sentence.

But the more they said this, the less confidence A Hao had, and he felt even more uneasy.

"Go ahead as you said."

After hearing Xiao Chen's suggestion, Su Nantian raised his eyebrows and smiled slightly, agreeing with their plan. Then he looked at Xiao Chen with a smile: "I didn't think you had such cleverness. You could even come up with such a tricky idea."

This way, it would not harm A Hao's life or dirty Su Nantian's hands. It could also punish them, and it was certainly more painful for A Hao to lose face than his life.

"Ha! You're too kind, Li Ge! This is all thanks to my sister."

Xiao Chen scratched the back of his head, looking embarrassed. He attributed all the credit to Chen Xiaoling.

"What? Brother, what does this have to do with me?"

After being mentioned, Chen Xiaoling was confused. She pointed at herself with her slender fingers and looked at Xiao Chen hesitantly: "I don't even know what your plan is!"

"Ha! You'll find out soon."

Xiao Chen smiled mysteriously and made a show of secrecy in front of Chen Xiaoling.

After saying this, he did not wait for Chen Xiaoling to speak and immediately took her backpack.

"Your paints and art supplies must be with you, right?"

Xiao Chen said this while opening the backpack.

Indeed, there was an unopened set of watercolor paints inside.

This was something Xiao Chen had heard Chen Xiaoling mention before; she said she had recently taken up painting. He never expected these paints would be useful now.

"Brother, are you planning to..."

Chen Xiaoling was a smart person and understood immediately.

Seeing Xiao Chen take out her paints and his sly expression, she had already guessed the truth.

"Bingo!"

After seeing his sister figure it out, Xiao Chen did not continue to hide the secret but happily confirmed it.

Soon after, Xiao Chen painted on A Hao's group's faces with the paints.

Because Su Nantian was there to keep order, neither A Hao nor his henchmen dared to move. They all knelt obediently and let Xiao Chen do as he pleased.

Soon, Xiao Chen's masterpiece was complete.

He painted a turtle on each of their faces and added two little mustaches to A Hao, making them even more ridiculous.

"Hahaha!"

Chen Xiaoling had not intended to laugh, but seeing them all painted into such an ugly appearance, she could not help but burst out laughing.

Even Su Nantian found this ridiculous scene amusing and felt a smile creeping onto his face.

To be honest, Xiao Chen's talent for teasing people was quite remarkable.

"Ugh..."

Xiao Chen held the brush, moving it left and right over A Hao's face. After looking at them for a while, he still felt somewhat unsatisfied and thought something was missing.

"Here..."

Xiao Chen narrowed his eyes, continuing to stare at A Hao and his group.

Chapter 806: Teasing

"Ugh, what's missing?"

Xiao Chen supported his chin, as if he had encountered a problem. His eyes were full of confusion.

A Hao and his group felt uneasy under Xiao Chen's gaze, taking a deep breath but saying nothing.

At this moment, they were like criminals awaiting execution, their hearts always in their throats. They no longer hoped to be spared by Su Nantian and his group.

What they wanted now was a swift end, no longer to be tormented with fear.

"Got it!"

Xiao Chen's eyes suddenly lit up, and he thought of a good idea. He quickly smiled again with that sinister expression.

A Hao's group had just thought they wanted a swift end, but now hearing that Xiao Chen truly had a plan to deal with them, their hearts jumped into their throats again. It felt as if they would jump out of their mouths the moment they opened them.

Moreover, all of their faces turned extremely grim; no one dared to make a sound.

What punishment awaited them?

"Little sister, turn your head away."

Xiao Chen first called out to Chen Xiaoling and added: "Don't look at it."

Chen Xiaoling was initially stunned but listened to her brother and immediately turned her head away.

Xiao Chen then snapped his fingers, giving an authoritative command to A Hao's group: "Take off your clothes."

"Take off your tops."

Xiao Chen commanded, relying on Su Nantian's presence behind him to act boldly.

But A Hao's group really fell for this, not daring to say anything but silently glaring at Xiao Chen. Their bodies, however, obeyed his orders and took off their tops.

Xiao Chen was even more ruthless this time, writing the four big characters "eternal criminal" in bright red on their bodies.

"That's it!"

Xiao Chen tidied up the paints and wiped his hands, finally satisfied.

Then he looked at A Hao's group: "Hey! Remember this—run five laps and come back here. Otherwise, if I find anyone slacking off, you'll know the consequences!"

To deal with such people, it was necessary to make them lose face.

And this was a method that killed without bloodshed.

Xiao Chen had planned it perfectly.

A Hao's group originally thought they would just be painted in the alley, and after they left, they could wipe it off with their clothes.

After all, one had to bow their head in a place of power and could not fight back.

But hearing Xiao Chen's demands becoming more excessive, and since this was a bus station with people coming and going, if they ran around outside, it would be foolish in front of everyone's eyes!

So when hearing Xiao Chen's demand, A Hao and his group immediately lifted their heads in disbelief, clearly not expecting Xiao Chen to be so ruthless.

When Su Nantian heard Xiao Chen say this, he thought it was well arranged.

Seeing A Hao's group glaring at Xiao Chen with hatred, Su Nantian let out a light laugh: "What? Do you have any objections to this decision?"

This was just using paint to deal with them, making them lose face. Compared to their previous bullying of villagers and oppressing the people, this was a small matter.

If they could not even bear this little hardship, then Su Nantian would not hold back.

"No, no! We have no objections at all!"

A Hao was terrified and, upon hearing Su Nantian's words, immediately shivered.

He felt a chill run down his spine and as if an ill-intentioned cold air had crept up from his feet.

If it were Xiao Chen who acted, there might still be a chance. But if Su Nantian himself took action, that would be trouble; they might not even survive intact.

After all, everyone knew Su Nantian was no one with a good temper.

Comparing the two, only a fool would choose to oppose Su Nantian.

Therefore, A Hao's group did not dare to show any dissatisfaction and obediently kept silent; no one had any more objections.

After Xiao Chen saw that they had no objections, he smiled and said: "That's right. Now start running. Remember to run five laps before returning here. If I find anyone slacking off, don't blame us for being unkind to you!"

This warning was just right and scared A Hao's group into a shiver.

They did not dare to resist anymore, immediately following Xiao Chen's orders and running out with their upper bodies bare.

They exposed the ridiculous turtles on their faces and the big characters "eternal criminal" on their bodies to everyone's view.

As soon as they appeared at the bus station, it immediately caused a big stir and became everyone's laughingstock.

Moreover, since A Hao's group often moved around this area, the local shopkeepers and people who frequently came to the bus station recognized their identities.

Now seeing them painted like this running around, no one felt sympathy for them; instead, many people took out their phones to capture this ridiculous scene and share it with friends and family.

A Hao's group became the laughingstock of the town because of this incident.

The town was not so developed, and information spread through word of mouth. Now it had been passed around so many times that there were countless versions.

But none of them were exceptions; the embarrassment was always on A Hao's group.

Of course, these news stories are later events.

At this moment, A Hao's group was still suffering here!

When A Hao's group ran out with humiliation, Chen Xiaoling turned around. She looked at Xiao Chen with a mix of amusement and helplessness.

"Brother, you're really cruel!"

Now that this incident spread, A Hao's group would no longer be able to live in this area. They were definitely going to become a laughingstock.

And those who lived here knew that A Hao's group were local bullies. Xiao Chen's actions equated to rubbing their faces in the dirt.

Chen Xiaoling first felt happy and relieved, but when she thought deeper, she began to worry: "But brother, are we really okay with offending them?"

A Hao's group were notorious bullies in this area. How could people like Xiao Chen, without any background, compare with them?

"Of course! We have Li Ge! There's no need to fear these people!"

Xiao Chen immediately answered Chen Xiaoling loudly and comforted her: "Besides, these people are trash in society. After living here for so long, they must be hated by gods and men. We've just done a good deed!"

Chapter 807: Hatred

After A Hao's group followed Xiao Chen's orders and ran a few laps before returning, they were filled with humiliation.

Under the stares of so many people laughing and watching, A Hao and his henchmen wished they could dig a hole to bury themselves.

Unfortunately, they couldn't even escape and had to run five laps before returning to tell Xiao Chen.

"Hao Ge, do we really have to return?"

One of the henchmen asked A Hao hesitantly, his face also filled with anxiety.

He was still hoping that A Hao could find a way to protect them from Su Nantian's group.

Especially when the henchmen thought about how they had been threatened by Su Nantian and lost so much face, and now they really had to run five laps outside.

The henchmen felt even more resentful.

And the henchmen now couldn't help but regret that they had not refused A Hao's money and come here to suffer.

Who would have thought that instead of teaching a lesson, they had been taught one themselves?

Now they had no face left at all!

If their friends saw this, they would never be able to live again.

After thinking about this, the henchman felt even more angry and dissatisfied.

At this moment, he could not help but ask A Hao for his opinion.

A Hao's face was full of embarrassment, yet he could only suppress his anger. He had already felt very irritated, and now hearing the henchman say this, he felt even worse.

The other henchmen saw their friend speaking and quickly turned to look at A Hao, hoping he had a plan.

They could not allow themselves to be bullied by Su Nantian's group forever.

At this moment, A Hao angrily scolded: "What else can we do? We have to return! Don't you know their strength?"

A Hao said this, looking at the henchman with even more disdain.

This situation was already embarrassing enough; if they pretended to be indifferent and let it go, it would be over.

But this guy was so foolish as to bring up the topic again, which was clearly trying to make him embarrassed.

So A Hao's mood was extremely irritated and felt that these henchmen were too foolish, making him lose face again.

Admitting Su Nantian's strength equaled losing face again!

Although A Hao also felt returning was embarrassing and shameful, compared to his life, what was face?

Moreover, they could find a chance later and retaliate against Su Nantian to deal with them.

But now it was not the time, because one had to bow their head under another's roof.

And A Hao had been crippled in his left hand by Su Nantian before, he knew that Su Nantian's words were not a joke. If they returned now, Su Nantian would definitely chase them to their place and deal with them.

After thinking this through, A Hao had no choice but to return.

The henchmen originally only hoped for luck and thought that A Hao might have a way to deal with Su Nantian.

But now, after hearing A Hao say this and also having to endure the embarrassment of returning, what could these underlings do?

The henchmen lowered their eyes and sighed in resignation.

At this moment, A Hao's face suddenly changed; he glared at these henchmen with hatred but said nothing.

The henchmen were still thinking about how Su Nantian and Xiao Chen would punish them, but they completely forgot that there was a hidden danger nearby.

A Hao had not forgotten how these henchmen had betrayed him when they were in danger. They had completely pushed him out and shifted all the blame onto himself.

Just thinking about this, A Hao could not let these henchmen live peacefully.

Of course, the immediate priority was to deal with Su Nantian and Xiao Chen.

After dealing with this matter, they could quickly restore their original peaceful life.

At that time, A Hao would let these henchmen receive the punishment they deserved and make them know they could not afford to offend him.

After thinking about this, A Hao's eyes looked at these henchmen with growing disdain and calculation.

He would make them know his strength, and they would regret having plotted against him.

The henchmen at this moment did not know what had happened, nor did they realize that they had become dead men in A Hao's mind.

They only wanted to quickly deal with Su Nantian and then return, never wanting to get involved in these matters again or obey A Hao's commands.

After all, A Hao looked capable but had failed to protect himself, let alone his subordinates.

These henchmen were only after money; if they had any harm to their lives, they would definitely not get involved again.

At this moment, their thoughts varied but none of them expressed it; they seemed to have no problems at all.

They walked back to the alley with turtles painted on their faces and "eternal criminal" written on their bodies, looking disheveled.

"Back already?"

When A Hao's group returned, they saw Su Nantian, Xiao Chen, and Chen Xiaoling standing in the same place.

Each of them had a calm expression as if nothing had happened.

When they returned, Xiao Chen immediately asked with mockery: "What? You're back already?"

Xiao Chen was clearly mocking and gloating at them, as if watching a good show. He showed no restraint towards A Hao's group.

"You!"

A Hao saw Xiao Chen's annoying expression and his mocking words, feeling an endless fire of anger burning inside him. It was almost impossible to suppress.

But Su Nantian was still there, so they dared not act rashly. Even if they were dissatisfied with Xiao Chen, they could not do anything for fear of angering Su Nantian.

A Hao was thinking about this, so he could not show any signs of anger and kept his head down, fearing that his hatred would be seen through.

This demon Su Nantian!

And this Xiao Chen, who was so reckless and dared to act with the support of Su Nantian!

If it were not for Su Nantian being here, this would all be empty talk.

Not only A Hao dared not speak, but the other henchmen also kept their eyes down and focused on their feet, saying nothing.

They were now praying that Su Nantian would let them go quickly and stop scaring them.

If they had thought about what Su Nantian would do to them on the way back, now their only thought was for the storm to come even fiercer.

If Su Nantian really wanted to deal with them, he should do it quickly so they would not have to suffer fear and be scared anymore.

"What? You didn't hear me?"

Xiao Chen did not get a response from A Hao and was dissatisfied.

Thinking about how A Hao had previously taught them, and now he even tried to bully his sister, Xiao Chen felt more hatred towards A Hao.

It was just making them lose face; his anger had not yet disappeared.

This was the real performance Xiao Chen had prepared!

When thinking about this, he looked down at A Hao and said these words.

A Hao was naturally dissatisfied with this punishment, but he had no choice but to comply because of being overpowered. He could not fight Su Nantian, so he had to do what they asked.

Now that he had completed this face-losing task, he was filled with anger inside.

Seeing Xiao Chen acting with the support of Su Nantian, A Hao felt even more discontent. But now that Su Nantian was still here, Xiao Chen's demands made A Hao feel very uncomfortable. He could only answer Xiao Chen quickly.

"No, I didn't refuse you; we're back."

A Hao was extremely frustrated and suppressed his dissatisfaction, answering Xiao Chen. His face looked strange because he was suppressing his anger.

And he complied quickly, now only wanting to get rid of them as soon as possible and find people later to deal with Su Nantian.

Now, Xiao Chen's arrogance was because of Su Nantian being here.

A Hao had already thought it through; once he found people to deal with Su Nantian, and Su Nantian fell, he would definitely make Xiao Chen regret his actions today.

But this all needed careful planning; currently, A Hao had no idea how to deal with Su Nantian.

But after these few reckless actions, A Hao had realized the gap between himself and Su Nantian.

He also knew that Su Nantian's strength was far beyond these ordinary people.

Not only could they not fight Su Nantian, but even national boxing champions were no match for him. They were like playing with children.

After understanding this, A Hao felt even more determined to plan carefully.

Once he returned home, he would find stronger people to deal with Su Nantian.

A Hao really did not believe that even if Su Nantian was so strong and had such supernatural abilities, he could protect himself and the whole fishing village.

Moreover, now A Hao had figured out what to do to make someone suffer more.

Killing Su Nantian would not have such an effect.

Su Nantian did not care about these villagers, so he would make them die one by one in front of Su Nantian.

After tormenting Su Nantian, he would send him to the afterlife!

"Hmph! Wang Li!"

A Hao angrily cursed under his breath, and just thinking of Su Nantian's name made him feel infinite hatred.

But his surface was still very obedient to Xiao Chen, as if he had no opinions at all and dared not have any.

In fact, A Hao was because of thinking through his future plans, believing he could deal with Su Nantian. He had to suppress his anger and pretend to comply.

Moreover, A Hao thought that there were always people stronger than others; Su Nantian was only strong in their eyes. Once real professionals appeared, Su Nantian would be completely out of his depth.

After thinking about this, A Hao's frustration was somewhat relieved, and the anger in his heart had also been dispelled.

He now felt that even if Su Nantian looked very strong here, he would definitely be able to punish Su Nantian later.

So now it was okay to suffer a little loss, and he could lower his head in front of him.

A Hao now was thinking about the saying, "As long as the green mountains are there, one need not worry about firewood."

Now he would just pretend to obey Su Nantian, and when his abilities improved, it would be the time for Su Nantian to be dealt with!

At this moment, Su Nantian raised his eyes and quickly scanned A Hao.

Although he did not know what was on A Hao's mind, seeing the flicker of joy and hatred in his eyes, Su Nantian knew.

A Hao was definitely thinking about something bad; perhaps he was secretly planning how to deal with himself.

After thinking about this, Su Nantian smiled inwardly and looked at A Hao with mockery.

He knew that people like A Hao would not learn from their mistakes. Even after Su Nantian had crippled his hand and given him a lesson, he still did not learn. He was always thinking about how to bite back.

But Su Nantian did not fear it and had no intention of putting A Hao in his heart.

Even if he found more people, Su Nantian had already made preparations to deal with the enemy.

As long as he was there, the fishing village would be protected by him!

Su Nantian would not let these people harm the villagers of the fishing village. If A Hao came over, Su Nantian would not hold back next time.

He would let them know the consequences of offending him.

Xiao Chen had originally intended to take advantage of this opportunity to further trouble A Hao and then mock him.

But he did not expect that A Hao was so compliant and had such a high level of cooperation.

He seemed to have tucked his tail between his legs, as if he would obey everything Xiao Chen said.

Xiao Chen was somewhat dissatisfied and felt that he had not played enough.

But since A Hao had completely cooperated, Xiao Chen could not find a reason to continue.

The other henchmen saw A Hao's cooperation and dared not speak, all lowering their heads in fear of being called by name.

Chapter 808: Trouble Comes

"Ugh, it's so boring."

Xiao Chen saw A Hao completely cooperating and felt somewhat uninterested.

He muttered under his breath, his tone carrying a hint of complaint.

But Xiao Chen also felt that if he continued to bully A Hao, it would make him seem like a person similar to A Hao—someone who had no good intentions and liked to bully the weak.

After thinking about this, Xiao Chen felt it was not worth it.
