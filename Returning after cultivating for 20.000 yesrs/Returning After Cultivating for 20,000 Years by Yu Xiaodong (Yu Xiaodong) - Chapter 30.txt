The eagle-eyed Yuan Ouming had seen many people who feared the strong and took advantage of the weak. As long as you were strong enough, they would immediately shed their disguises and reveal their true nature.

Xu Wenhao stared intently at Yuan Ouming, afraid of any movement he might make. He forced himself to stay calm and said, "I know your family background is powerful, but if you dare touch me today, all these sharp eyes around us will see clearly! If you have the guts, just go ahead and strike first?"

Yuan Ouming smiled slightly after hearing this. He clenched his fists, the sound of cracking knuckles echoing as he slowly spoke: "Sorry, I really don't fear it."

Xu Wenhao wasn't pleased upon hearing this. How could he win her heart if he appeared timid in front of the one he loved?

His macho pride immediately flared up. He feigned fearlessness and said, "Speak your mind. How should this matter be resolved?"

Upon hearing Xu Wenhao's attempt at reconciliation, Yuan Ouming thought it was the funniest joke in the world. "You? Even dare to make demands with me?"

"Still, I've been wanting to fight someone recently." "Why don't we try? If you win, this matter will be over."

This would also allow him to test how his recent cultivation had progressed. Thinking of this, Yuan Ouming licked his lips and flashed a confident smile.

Xu Wenhao also smiled. After all, he had been fighting since childhood and had so many people behind him.

Who was afraid of whom?

"Then let's try."

Before the words had even finished, Xu Wenhao rolled up his sleeves and rushed forward with a punch aimed at Yuan Ouming's head.

Yuan Ouming glanced at Xu Wenhao and calmly moved his body aside, easily dodging the attack.

Xu Wenhao's eyes widened. He stared at Yuan Ouming with a look as if he had discovered a shocking secret, his face filled with disbelief.

He muttered, "How is this possible? How could I be so fast and still be dodged so easily by him?"

Upon seeing this, Yuan Ouming chuckled and immediately punched forward, saying, "Then it's only your own fault for not trying hard enough."

At that moment, Xu Wenhao saw Yuan Ouming's punch coming and instinctively raised his arms to block.

This single move immediately revealed the difference in strength.

Xu Wenhao was pushed back by Yuan Ouming's punch, his eyes filled with fear.

Yuan Ouming smiled and said, "How about it? Are you scared?"

Xu Wenhao didn't answer. His eyes remained fixed on Yuan Ouming, silent.

Yuan Ouming said with a smile, "If you just kneel down and say I'm sorry, then today I'll let you go. From now on, I'll forget this."

"You're dreaming!"

"Comrades, the opportunity to make a name for yourself has arrived. Let's go."

Xu Wenhao shouted with all his strength, but the people behind him didn't move at all. He turned around and saw that they had already retreated far away.

Xu Wenhao's eyes were red. He rushed forward with all his remaining strength, raising his fist again to teach Yuan Ouming a lesson and show the others what he was capable of.

Although his family's power wasn't as strong as Yuan Ouming's, he still wanted to use his own strength to break Yuan Ouming's arrogance and show who dared not listen to him.

But he didn't know that the two of them were on completely different levels.

Yuan Ouming curled his lips in a cold smile, looking down at him: "Just like this, you still want to threaten me? How annoying."

Without further words, Yuan Ouming also punched forward.

That punch was powerful and dazzling.

Crack! The two fists collided, a clear sound of bone breaking echoed.

Then Xu Wenhao's body kept retreating, blood seeping from his mouth.

Yuan Ouming continued to mock him, saying slowly: "How about it, Xu Wenhao? Do you still want to fight with me?"

As he said this, he intentionally glanced at Gao Jingjing, wanting to see if she was shocked by his powerful punch.

That guy could do it. So could Yuan Ouming.

But the scene he saw immediately shattered his fragile heart.

She had ignored him. He had never been ignored by a woman before. Everywhere he went, he was the center of attention; all the women wanted to give him their bodies.

This was a blatant humiliation.

Xu Wenhao remained kneeling on the ground, his eyes tightly fixed on Yuan Ouming. He said nothing.

His fists were clenched so tight that blood dripped down, but he seemed to feel no pain at all.

He hated himself for lacking the strength to defeat Yuan Ouming, and for not being able to show off in front of the one he loved.

But now it was too late. It would be better to save his life and keep the mountains and rivers, so he could still have a chance later.

Xu Wenhao curled up on the ground, saying nothing but watching Yuan Ouming with longing eyes.

Yuan Ouming was in a rage and suddenly kicked Xu Wenhao's stomach with all his strength.

Xu Wenhao's body immediately curled up like a shrimp.

"I said it! I really did regret it! Forgive me!"

What was face and dignity? What was more important than his life!

And Gao Jingjing, if he couldn't get her, it was no problem to find another! Why fight so hard!

Chapter 138: Bragging

There was also Su Nantian, everything was because of him.

Yuan Ouming's background was too big. From the aura he had just shown, he was of the same kind as the club leader Long Hu Yan. In this case, the club leader might not come to his aid.

But Su Nantian was clearly a poor boy, one who had just arrived in the city. He didn't know how he met Gao Jingjing.

Thus, Xu Wenhao attributed all his anger to Su Nantian. After understanding this, his heart felt much better and he silently endured Yuan Ouming's anger.

Even after hearing his apology, Yuan Ouming was still not satisfied and slapped Xu Wenhao's face repeatedly.

In an instant, the clear sound of slaps echoed around and didn't fade away for a long time.

Xu Wenhao sat on the ground, tightly covering his face with his hands. His eyes showed undeniable fear.

"Get out of here quickly! Don't appear in my sight again, otherwise I'll beat you every time I see you. Let you never forget me and become a demon in your dreams."

After hearing Yuan Ouming's words, Xu Wenhao felt like he had been saved and quickly nodded and bowed.

"Yes, yes. You can rest assured that I will remember it well!"

"Ah," Yuan Ouming didn't even look at him, directly using his nose to respond to Xu Wenhao.

Xu Wenhao quickly picked up his clothes and ran away, also taking with him those fence-sitters.

"Such cowards! Why didn't you just attack immediately? What are you waiting for! Cowards, I'll deal with you later!"

"Yes, yes..." The group quickly replied. Although they looked down on Xu Wenhao, they couldn't help but be afraid of his club leader.

Seeing Xu Wenhao fleeing in panic, the crowd let out a cheer and all looked at Yuan Ouming with admiration.

Among the crowd, Gao Jingjing lowered her head indifferently. Finally, she secretly glanced at Yuan Ouming's triumphant expression but this man could never compare to Nantian. She pulled Su Nantian and wanted to leave.

Yuan Ouming had just defeated the self-important rival, his mood was high. He looked at Gao Jingjing again but she had already glanced at him, which immediately made his excitement soar to the sky. However, she was about to leave.

"Wait!"

He must be shy. He thought this way and instinctively called out towards her, then took a big step to chase after her.

The onlookers thought he hadn't finished punishing Xu Wenhao and again encouraged him with shouts.

"Don't let him run away! Let him show off my god's strength again!"

"Yes! Ouming, if you say your ultimate technique, he'll be unable to get up again!"

Among the crowd, many had been shocked by Yuan Ouming's previous consecutive blows and had already forgotten Su Nantian's bold demeanor. They even unconsciously regarded Yuan Ouming as the number one tough guy in Fengyue University, and automatically showed a fascinated and astonished expression.

However, Yuan Ouming had no time to care about the fleeing Xu Wenhao. His most urgent need was Gao Jingjing's favor, to have her willingly lie in bed and be at his mercy.

But reality was always different from imagination. Gao Jingjing didn't show any admiration for him, but rather seemed to dislike her more.

"Wait! Don't go!"

Gao Jingjing heard Yuan Ouming's call behind her. She didn't need to think, she grabbed Su Nantian and hurriedly ran into the campus.

Su Nantian's inner feelings were also helpless. That rookie could easily beat ten people without effort, was it necessary to run?

The crowd stirred up. Various voices were heard continuously. Xu Wenhao, who had run far away, suddenly turned back and saw Yuan Ouming running towards his direction. He was scared to death and immediately felt a surge of energy, fleeing with all his might.

"Haha, Xu Wenhao is really timid."

"He doesn't even have the courage to fight Yuan Ouming, how dare he compete for the campus beauty."

At this moment, Yuan Ouming had gained many more admirers. While waiting for the show, they all stood on his side and laughed at Xu Wenhao's cowardice.

But to everyone's surprise, Yuan Ouming completely ignored the fleeing Xu Wenhao and blocked Gao Jingjing and Su Nantian's path. He smiled at the beautiful girl in front of him.

"Earlier, you saw that Xu Wenhao was definitely no match for me. This person is too ungrateful. Now you should know who to choose, right?"

Gao Jingjing frowned and her beautiful eyes showed a hint of indifference. She replied indifferently, "I don't understand what you're saying."

Of course, Yuan Ouming and Xu Wenhao both chased her. She naturally knew it but had no interest in their self-importance.

Yuan Ouming saw her lack of interest and smiled patiently to continue his efforts. "What I mean is, Xu Wenhao has already been defeated by me. If you plan to have a boyfriend, you can directly consider choosing me. With me around, no one will dare to bully you."

After saying this, he looked meaningfully at Su Nantian.

As soon as the words were said, Gao Jingjing suddenly let out a laugh. She found his vague confession amusing and his eager expression was quite comical.

She kept her white face straight and replied seriously, "Sorry, I'm not planning to have a boyfriend right now. Even if I do, it won't be you."

After saying this, Gao Jingjing didn't want to say anything else and turned around to leave.

Yuan Ouming saw this, his face immediately felt embarrassed. After all, there were so many people around him. If he couldn't win Gao Jingjing's favor, it would definitely bring doubts.

Beating Xu Wenhao was not enough. Winning Gao Jingjing's heart was the ultimate goal, so he was determined to achieve it today.

"Hey!" Yuan Ouming shouted loudly and forcibly called out Gao Jingjing. Because he was unsure, he used his presence to disguise himself. "How did I fight earlier? Everyone knows I did it for you..."

Gao Jingjing didn't want to argue with him anymore. She was even more annoyed by his one-sided love.

She stopped again and turned around, coldly snorted and smiled mockingly. "What does it matter? I have no interest in people like you."

Yuan Ouming didn't like this. Although he really wanted to win Gao Jingjing, his pride couldn't be ignored. Gao Jingjing's repeated refusals made him quite annoyed and his impatience grew.

"Am I arrogant?" He looked surprised, pointing at his face and asking. "I speak based on my strength!不信 you ask the people here, who dare to come up and fight with me?"

Yuan Ouming's move was just a bluff. He used the current admiration of the crowd to encourage them to accept his proposal.

But Gao Jingjing, as a campus beauty, was used to the pursuit of many people. She looked down on Yuan Ouming's simple and crude love, so she couldn't move her heart.

Chapter 139: Crushing Superiority

"Okay, you are the strongest in Fengyue University. I admit it. Are you satisfied?" Gao Jingjing frowned and glanced at him with a clear eye. "But what does it have to do with me?"

After the words, Yuan Ouming's face darkened and the crowd fell silent instantly.

At this moment he felt very embarrassed, and it was his longed-for beloved who had made him lose face.

Yuan Ouming's face turned dark and he stared at Gao Jingjing's beautiful face. His self-esteem felt like it had been torn apart.

At this moment, the silence in the surroundings was broken by a voice, as if talking to himself.

"Who is it that deserves to be the strongest in Fengyue University?"

This statement immediately made the crowd even more silent. The atmosphere was extremely strange, and everyone stared at each other in confusion, wondering who said this at such a time.

Yuan Ouming was like a fire that had been lit, his accumulated anger burst out immediately.

"Who? Who said that?" Yuan Ouming shouted at the crowd, but no one responded.

Gao Jingjing smiled indifferently and looked down on Yuan Ouming with contempt. She was actually glad for the person who had the courage.

"Who is it? No one speaks. You all fight with me!" Yuan Ouming's anger burned towards the crowd, his eyes red and staring at everyone.

One second passed, two seconds. Finally, a clear-eyed person stood up with a deep and calm expression.

"I don't know who said it, but I know that what he said was right." Su Nantian stepped out from behind Gao Jingjing, his face showing no signs of fear and looking coldly at Yuan Ouming.

Yuan Ouming was puzzled. This kid was up to something again. The voice clearly didn't come from this side, but he was sure it was this kid who was up to something.

He then looked at Gao Jingjing with a raised eyebrow and said, "You also saw how I taught Xu Wenhao. This kid is coming to die. Don't blame me for hurting the weak."

The atmosphere of war was spreading secretly, and people immediately realized there would be another show. They shouted again.

Yuan Ouming didn't really want to fight this kid, but he was unsure. From the aura that kid had released earlier, it was stronger than him. But only after a fight could they know the result.

But he now urgently wanted to prove himself in front of Gao Jingjing. Only by defeating this kid could he make Gao Jingjing change her mind.

He pointed his finger at Su Nantian's nose and said, "You have guts. Accept my challenge!"

Su Nantian coldly stared at Yuan Ouming, seeing his arrogant demeanor. He felt both contempt and found it amusing.

But for the onlookers, action was more important than attitude. If he backed down, not only would Gao Jingjing continue to be troubled by Yuan Ouming, but he himself would also be mocked in Fengyue University.

This fight was unavoidable. But Yuan Ouming's words "hurting the weak" were too arrogant.

A common cultivator at the third level of cultivation was so arrogant in front of him. If Su Nantian didn't teach him a lesson, he would be unworthy of being the Immortal Lord.

Thinking about this, Su Nantian calmly replied, "Okay. But first take your dog's paws off."

Hearing this, the crowd laughed.

Yuan Ouming almost got angry at their reaction. But due to face, his finger didn't let go and he gritted his teeth: "Speak cleanly. I'll give you three moves, so that people don't say I'm bullying the weak!"

"No need!"

After saying this, these three words just entered Yuan Ouming's ears. Su Nantian immediately grabbed his index finger with lightning speed, and didn't use much strength at all. He just heard a scream.

In fact, Su Nantian didn't release any power at all. He just used the sudden strength of his muscles, but still broke the finger.

The battle hadn't even started yet. Yuan Ouming had already suffered a big loss. The pain of the broken finger immediately reduced his strength by half.

"Ouch... " He stamped his foot on the ground, not knowing what way to ease the pain of the broken finger.

"You bastard! You attacked me secretly! A despicable person!" Yuan Ouming spat on the ground.

But Su Nantian had just played a little trick, or rather, to give him a warning. If at this time Yuan Ouming declared defeat, then the subsequent fight could be avoided.

The two people were not on the same cultivation level. Actually, there was no need to fight at all. If it wasn't for Su Nantian hiding most of his power and playing a performance, Yuan Ouming would have been beaten to death.

"Are you still going to fight with me?" Su Nantian said calmly, asking back.

This sentence sounded provocative to Yuan Ouming's ears. He wiped his nose and glared at Su Nantian: "Don't talk nonsense, if you don't play dirty tricks, I haven't prepared yet!"

High-level martial artists didn't need so many rules. Su Nantian knew this, but he didn't want to argue with him.

"Okay. You were too slow earlier. I thought you were born slow. Well, this time let you go first!" Su Nantian calmly and politely made a "please" gesture.

Everyone's eyes were focused on them, all expecting a more exciting fight than before.

Yuan Ouming frowned as if thinking of strategies. He had to beat Su Nantian, so that Gao Jingjing could see his real combat power and also establish himself in Fengyue University.

"This is your own fault. Don't blame me if you lose." Yuan Ouming gritted his teeth and glared at Su Nantian. He also attacked him unexpectedly.

A cultivator of the third level of cultivation was still in the basic stage. In terms of magic, it could be ignored. So he mostly used brute strength.

But this time to fully deal with Su Nantian, Yuan Ouming still used the basic techniques of the fire technique he had learned. He pretended to have a little bit of inner energy and directly used his palm wind to push the energy out of his body.

Like a gentle breeze, Su Nantian smiled and immediately used the Wind-Stepping technique to avoid it. He skillfully dodged.

The crowd erupted in applause, and people kept shouting for Su Nantian to do a move.

For Su Nantian's strength, if he didn't pretend, each move would bring a strong killing power. So the real strong people were more important to learn how to control.

Su Nantian didn't want a one-move kill, so he put away the Wind-Stepping technique and symbolically used palm power as a counterattack.

Su Nantian aimed at Yuan Ouming's forehead and, when he struck, he suppressed the inner energy that surged.

Chapter 140: Chaotic Cafeteria

Even though he had reduced his power by more than nine-tenths, Yuan Ouming was still irresistibly drawn to Su Nantian like the positive and negative poles of a magnet.

"Wow! That's too fake!"

"What is this?!"

The crowd was all stunned. They saw Yuan Ouming being drawn to Su Nantian.

Then, to make this fight at least look like it was going well, Su Nantian clenched his fist and directly hit his eye socket.

Boom!

Even though he used minimal strength, the dull sound still left everyone in shock. Including Gao Jingjing, her eyes were wide and her lips parted.

"Ugh..."

Yuan Ouming had no chance to fight back. Su Nantian's punch hit his left eye socket, and he staggered backward several steps before falling to the ground.

"Awesome!"

"One punch KO!"

"That's the number one tough guy in Fengyue!"

...

The crowd clapped their hands, and the cheers drowned out Yuan Ouming's groans on the ground.

The fight was over. Short and decisive.

Su Nantian looked around at everyone, about to leave the scene when he suddenly noticed a girl walking over from a distance.

It was Wu Lianxing.

Su Nantian's expression changed, his inner thoughts surprised. He hadn't expected her to appear at this time.

Wu Lianxing's arrival immediately caused a stir among the crowd. As a new star with both talent and beauty, she was sure to be surrounded wherever she went.

At this time, Yuan Ouming was still rolling on the ground. The punch had only hit his eye socket, but Su Nantian's aura had already affected him.

In hushed whispers, Wu Lianxing walked up to Su Nantian and glanced at Yuan Ouming. She asked indifferently, "Are you fighting?"

This question was both obvious and unexpected for Su Nantian. He didn't know how to answer, so he just smiled kindly.

However, the punch that Su Nantian had landed on Yuan Ouming's eye socket was exactly what Wu Lianxing saw. Although she remained calm, her heart had already been captivated by Su Nantian.

"Your punch just now..." Wu Lianxing slightly pressed her lips and then smiled, revealing a pair of dazzling teeth. "It was really cool!"

The words had just finished when Su Nantian hadn't even reacted, and the crowd had already responded for him.

In a chorus of cheers, everyone was envious and jealous of Su Nantian.

After all, it wasn't everyone who could get Wu Lianxing's words of praise.

Or rather, Su Nantian was the first one in the world!

After this fight ended, it quickly spread throughout the school. Wu Lianxing's praise of Su Nantian became a popular topic.

Wu Lianxing sat at the entrance of the teaching building, quietly waiting for Su Nantian and Gao Jingjing to finish school.

"This way, I can also get closer to Su Nantian!"

After saying this, she felt her face was hot and smiled.

At that moment, she looked up and saw Su Nantian and Gao Jingjing leaving the school gate.

"That girl is still with him..."

But it's okay. Which excellent man doesn't have several women around him?

As Su Nantian got closer, Wu Lianxing's gaze gradually moved from Su Nantian and also walked towards him.

She was naturally very attractive, immediately drawing the attention of many people. A group of people who couldn't recognize Wu Lianxing were guessing her identity.

Wu Lianxing didn't get angry. She smiled大方ly and let them guess.

When Su Nantian saw this scene, it was a woman staring at him and smiling gracefully.

Gao Jingjing stood by Su Nantian's side, smiled at Wu Lianxing and said hello.

"Why haven't you left yet? It's been a long time since school ended."

"Of course, I was waiting for you to eat together!"

Su Nantian smiled and looked at Wu Lianxing, asking where she wanted to eat.

Wu Lianxing smiled and said, "It doesn't matter. Anywhere is fine as long as I can eat with Su Nantian."

Gao Jingjing saw that the two of them couldn't decide, and suggested, "The restaurant on campus has good food. We can try it."

Both nodded in agreement.

Except for Su Nantian, who was rarely seen, the other two had high profiles. Even if Su Nantian tried to be low-key, now that he was accompanied by two high-profile people, he couldn't stay low-key.

At noon, it was the peak time for meals. People kept walking into the cafeteria. Every few people met, they would stare at the three of them for a while.

The cafeteria was noisy. As soon as the three entered, the scene instantly became silent. A group of eyes immediately focused on the three standing at the entrance.

Used to this kind of scene, the three calmly walked deeper into the cafeteria through the crowd's gaze.

Someone suddenly shouted in the crowd, "Isn't that Wu Lianxing and Gao Jingjing?!"

Before the words had finished, another voice immediately responded.

"Su Nantian! The one in the middle is Su Nantian!"

In this era of mobile phones, any news spread quickly. The news that the three were eating in the cafeteria immediately spread. Wu Lianxing's fans jumped up and ran towards the cafeteria with their friends.

The school's forum was already in chaos. The comments were constantly updated.

At this moment, the three were surrounded by a crowd in the cafeteria. They were surrounded and stood in the middle of the crowd.

Everyone wanted to get closer, and if they could have a physical contact it would be better. People pushed each other, you squeezed me and I squeezed you, all wanting to show their faces in front of the idol.

On this side, someone shouted, "Don't crowd!" On that side, another person cursed: "Who the hell stepped on my foot!"

Su Nantian was disturbed by this noise and frowned. The atmosphere around him immediately dispersed.

Su Nantian's aura was too strong, so the people also didn't dare to get too close. They instinctively stayed one meter away and automatically formed a line, holding paper and pens to ask for signatures. The phones in the back no longer flashed but only secretly took photos.

Some veteran fans saw Su Nantian and couldn't help but swallow their saliva: "That person is too repressed!"

They also took several more photos and secretly sent them to their dormitory group. As long as there was one fan in the dorm, others would soon become fans too.

After sending a few photos, the group immediately exploded. As a school celebrity, he had just established his image in people's hearts through a fight.

This time they saw him alive, the fans' eyes were glowing. They wanted to devour them.

Chapter 141: First Encounter with a Wealthy Woman

Wu Lianxing skillfully signed names on the side, selectively answering various trivial questions asked by fans. She also occasionally glanced at Su Nantian's expression.

Su Nantian had no sign of impatience. Gao Jingjing also didn't show any signs of annoyance. Su Nantian did not regard these people as important, and Gao Jingjing's good upbringing always guided her behavior. Plus, Su Nantian hadn't said anything.

Whoever asked if they could take a photo was weak. Wu Lianxing smiled and nodded, Gao Jingjing also agreed with it. Su Nantian didn't mind either.

A group of fans were excited and couldn't speak, thinking that today was a good day to go out. Some people who were just joining the fun were both annoyed and watched these brainless fans quietly.

"Can we go now, everyone? We also need to eat. If we stay together like this, the cafeteria staff might not give us food."

As a noblewoman, Gao Jingjing's words were very in line with her ladylike identity.

Su Nantian still had a neutral expression, looking at the crowd around him. His eyes showed no signs of waves. To him, these people had nothing to do with him.

Gao Jingjing's words carried some weight. After hearing this, the crowd automatically made way for them. The three quickly but gracefully entered the elevator on the right.

Indeed, rich people were different. Even eating a meal required going to the upper floor's private room. The crowd couldn't watch them eat.

Fengyue School was indeed a famous school in Fengcheng. It should be said that it was a school where rich people gathered. Even the cafeteria was designed like a famous Western restaurant, with double layers that attracted everyone's attention.

Generally, students preferred to eat on the first floor. Because people who could go up to the second floor were usually those with status, and others wouldn't let them go up.

As a person who had lived for two thousand years, Su Nantian thought about how they were surrounded together earlier. His mind involuntarily recalled his previous powerful times, where people in the cultivation world had respected and praised him. After thousands of years passed, human nature remained unchanged.

Those people had obtained what they wanted and left satisfied.

As soon as they stepped onto the second floor, several attendants led them to a private room.

The room was designed in an ancient style with a strong sense of scholarly culture, making everyone feel very comfortable.

The three sat down at the table. Gao Jingjing and Wu Lianxing were seated next to each other, while Su Nantian was opposite.

Gao Jingjing yawned and stretched lazily, leaning on the table with her chin in hand.

"Ah, finally can have a good meal."

Wu Lianxing placed her newly bought limited edition bag on the seat next to her. She elegantly brushed her hair aside with her hand, and her thick black hair made her face more refined.

"Indeed, it was a bit unexpected. I wish we had gone out to eat instead. That would have been quieter."

After saying this, she took out a puffing powder to touch up her makeup. After all, it was her dream lover here; she had to look beautiful.

Su Nantian also couldn't help but nod. He hadn't expected that after so long, humans had become more and more crazy. Wanting to be on the sky, although he was also in demand, but they dared not directly block him?

But after such a long time of hustle and bustle, everyone was hungry. He waved his hand: "Waiter, order."

Don't be surprised why the school cafeteria has waiters. After all, money can move even ghosts. And this school was definitely not short of money.

A few steps away, the female waiter heard Su Nantian call her and ran over quickly: "Sir, what would you like to order?"

Although the waiter's face was calm, her heart was already overjoyed. She had noticed this man's presence since they first entered.

His charming eyes and devilish body!

She wanted to be lucky enough to serve him!

The waiter stood next to Su Nantian and was already stunned. She thought she could go back and show off to her sisters.

They would be jealous of me, hehehe.

"Waiter? Are you okay?"

A sweet voice pulled the waiter back to reality. She saw Wu Lianxing, who was opposite her, looking at her with concern.

She immediately regained her senses and blushed. She waved her hand to indicate it was okay, lowered her eyes, and heard another girl's giggles. She felt even more embarrassed and only dared to glance at Su Nantian secretly, seeing what his reaction was.

Su Nantian felt her gaze and looked up with a gentle smile: "Can I continue to order?"

The waiter nodded repeatedly, and her feelings for Su Nantian soared.

At this moment, Su Nantian looked up and asked the two ladies opposite him what they wanted to eat.

Gao Jingjing said it was fine. Wu Lianxing spoke up: "I heard the signature dishes here are good. Let's try them."

"Then let's have the signature dishes."

After ordering, they each had their own thoughts while waiting for the food.

Gao Jingjing and Wu Lianxing were both jealous because they had seen Su Nantian's strong attraction to women. They felt a bit envious and sighed about the number of rivals.

Su Nantian's thoughts weren't as delicate. He didn't think about it that way, but was thinking about how to improve his cultivation faster.

Invisible to them, the restaurant's door was opened by several people. They came in one after another.

Everyone reflexively looked towards the entrance, and they saw several men in suits leading a tall woman in.

This caused a stir in the crowd.

A tall and beautiful woman, under the moonlight, walked with a catwalk.

She wore sunglasses that covered half her face. Her every move and expression was full of charm.

Her S-shaped perfect figure was even more seductive under the strapless shorts.

It seemed like she had a built-in flash, dazzling everyone's eyes.

"Wow! She is so beautiful. I even cried as a woman."

"She's too good-looking. If I could marry her, I would be willing to die early!"

The crowd was in a commotion.

She gently took off her sunglasses with her jade-like fingers and shook her hair. She looked around the cafeteria.

This action also caused a commotion in the crowd.

She was Chen Jiayi, who had accidentally heard Su Nantian's song online and decided to meet him. After the video of his appearance spread, she vowed to marry no one but him and sent people everywhere to find out about him.

She had just heard the latest news that Su Nantian was seen outside Fengyue University.

Chapter 142: Scandal

After seeing the news, Chen Jiayi immediately put down her work and rushed over. She also heard girls talking about a man in the cafeteria who was very handsome, so she stopped them and asked for photos. She confirmed it was him.

But where was he now?

Chen Jiayi frowned and looked around. At this moment, her eyes lit up. She saw Su Nantian's figure from the glass.

Indeed, he was as handsome as in the photo!

But there were also several women opposite him?

Wait, weren't these the recently popular Wu Lianxing and Gao Jingjing?

Why were they together?

Hmph, this Gao Jingjing. She had always pretended to be elegant, but now she was so eager?

Chen Jiayi's eyes were already burning with fierce anger. She had regarded the two as thorns in her eye and meat in her flesh!

Such an excellent man could only be mine!

But now she couldn't act rashly. First impressions were still important.

Chen Jiayi looked around and a bodyguard behind her immediately stepped forward, bending down.

She whispered into the bodyguard's ear with her cherry lips. The man's Adam's apple moved, and he resisted the urge to hold her in his arms.

After all, his dream lover was so close!

"Take them outside and wait for me. Don't come out without my orders."

"But Miss..."

"Nothing, go quickly."
