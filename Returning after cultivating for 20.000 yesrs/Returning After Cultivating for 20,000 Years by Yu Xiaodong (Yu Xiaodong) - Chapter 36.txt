It was precisely due to that incident that Zhang Xue no longer approached Su Nantian with the same empty fury as before.

From that moment on, every time Zhang Xue clashed with Su Nantian, her heart would race and her face would flush abruptly. These reactions unsettled Zhang Xue greatly, making her avoid these feelings deliberately.

After Su Nantian had unfastened her buttons that day, she had labeled him as a "bully" and a "lecher."

From that moment, Zhang Xue had been desperately seeking an opportunity to retaliate against Su Nantian. When Shen Huayun arrived to inspect and transfer personnel, Zhang Xue had originally not wanted to go. However, upon hearing the name "Su Nantian," she immediately became interested and hurriedly grabbed her equipment to follow Feng Yue.

Now, everything was prepared except for the final push—but why had the wind hesitated?

Zhang Xue grew impatient and lightly furrowed her brow, pushing Feng Yue.

Feng Yue looked at Zhang Xue in confusion. Zhang Xue was irritated by his foolishness, stomping her foot twice before pulling him close and whispering, "What's the matter? You're still hesitating here! What are you waiting for to catch Su Nantian?"

Feng Yue sighed, "I can't take on the Lin family."

Zhang Xue glared at him. "Then do you think you can take on the Shen family?"

Feng Yue quickly waved his hands, glancing nervously at the stern-faced Shen Huayun beside them. "I never said that!"

Zhang Xue continued to urge him, "Then why aren't you rushing to catch Su Nantian? Although Su Nantian is the boyfriend of the Lin family's daughter, they aren't here now. If you anger the Shen family, Shen Huayun is right beside you!"

This half-threatening remark caused Feng Yue's legs to tremble, and his expression grew even more conflicted.

Su Nantian, who had been pretending to doze on a chair, lifted his eyelids and glanced at Feng Yue's hesitation before looking at Zhang Xue, who was eager to seize him. He sighed deeply. "Zhang Xue really can't bear to see me do well; she always finds ways to make Su Nantian suffer."

But even if he entered the Inspection Team this time, it wasn't a big deal for Su Nantian. It would at least make Zhang Xue happy.

Su Nantian changed his mind and said, "Before I change my mind again, let's go."

Feng Yue hurriedly asked, "Where… where are we going?"

Su Nantian stood up and stretched his neck. "The Inspection Team."

Feng Yue thought he had misheard, rubbing his ears.

Su Nantian impatiently glanced at Feng Yue. "Are you leading or am I?"

This statement startled even Zhang Xue and Shen Huayun, who had been hoping Feng Yue would take Su Nantian away.

Shen Huayun inwardly sneered, thinking Su Nantian must be so bold because of the Lin family's backing.

But wasn't their goal to get Su Nantian into the Inspection Team? Shen Huayun was satisfied, even delighted.

Zhang Xue, however, felt uneasy. At first, she had wanted Feng Yue to take Su Nantian back, but she didn't want to wait for Su Nantian to agree.

There was a world of difference between willingly going and being forcibly taken.

Among the people present, only Feng Yue seemed genuinely happy. His face had completely shed its previous hesitation, replaced by joy. He secretly mused:

Su Nantian himself had said he was going to the Inspection Team, not Feng Yue's demand. If something went wrong later, it wouldn't be on Feng Yue's head. Moreover, bringing Su Nantian back today was a significant favor for the Shen family.

Feng Yue nodded to Su Nantian, "Mr. Su, then I'll trouble you."

Shen Huayun grew impatient as Feng Yue hesitated to produce his handcuffs, stepping beside him and pointing at the cuffs on his waist.

Feng Yue's face turned slightly grim. Su Nantian had agreed to go voluntarily, which was already a great favor. Shen Huayun's actions made him extremely uneasy.

Feng Yue smiled politely at Shen Huayun, "Director Chen, I think this isn't necessary."

"Why isn't it necessary? He's the one who injured my son and is extremely dangerous. What if he escapes in the middle?" Shen Huayun spoke earnestly, leaving no room for Feng Yue.

"Mr. Feng, it's fine. Just cuff me," Su Nantian spoke up.

Feng Yue felt apologetic as he took the handcuffs from his waist and gently fastened them around Su Nantian's wrists.

"Sorry, Mr. Su."

Su Nantian smiled, "It's fine; this little thing is meaningless to me."

Feng Yue awkwardly smiled. He naturally knew that someone who could kill a Red Soul couldn't be restrained by this.

Su Nantian clenched his hands, and with a clear sound, the cuffs snapped in half.

Su Nantian finally smiled slightly, tossing the broken cuffs into Shen Huayun's arms. "Take it as a memento; maybe you'll need it next time."

With that, Su Nantian ignored Shen Huayun's stunned expression and walked out of the classroom door.

Shen Huayun saw Su Nantian about to exit the school gates and hurriedly called out, "Quick! Catch him; Su Nantian's escaping!"

Feng Yue had already been embarrassed by Su Nantian in front of Zhang Xue, so he was already agitated. Upon hearing Shen Huayun's shout, his irritation deepened. "Mr. Shen, just trust him; Mr. Su has never broken his word."

Chapter 168: Hasty Departure

Shen Huayun furrowed his brow, doubting Feng Yue's words but immediately following Su Nantian's steps.

Before the classroom door, Su Nantian stopped abruptly and didn't move.

Shen Huayun inwardly sneered: "I thought you were so arrogant, but even you are afraid!"

"Why aren't you moving? Have you finally backed down?" Shen Huayun asked from behind Su Nantian.

Su Nantian only gave Shen Huayun his back, so Shen Huayun couldn't see Su Nantian's facial expression. A moment later, Su Nantian turned his head to look at Shen Huayun, his eyes filled with disdain.

Sunlight from the large classroom door illuminated Su Nantian's body, as if gilding him in golden light, making him appear inviolable.

"Where do you want to take Su Nantian?" Before the group could react to Su Nantian's aura, a clear voice from the doorway pulled them back to reality.

Feng Yue, hearing the voice, thought it was just a little girl coming to cause trouble. He didn't even look at the person, grumbling, "The Inspection Team is handling business; what's it to you? Go play somewhere else!"

Suddenly, the scene fell silent.

Su Nantian was about to say something when another voice different from before echoed.

If the first voice had been like a yellow bird in an empty valley, this one was as smooth as clouds drifting across the sky.

"I didn't know our Gao family had so little authority in front of the Inspection Team."

Though her voice was gentle, her words carried a subtle pressure. This made Su Nantian's eyes brighten; he hadn't expected Gao Jingjing to have such a dominant side when handling affairs.

He thought of Gao Jingjing's usual gentle nature, how she would blush after saying two sentences.

Now, the Gao Jingjing at the door was like discovering a new world to Su Nantian.

The people inside the classroom were startled by the mention of "Gao family."

Feng Yue and Shen Huayun had hesitated to catch Su Nantian before because of the Lin family. Even though they weren't present, their influence made everyone wary.

Now another Gao family had appeared on the scene.

Shen Huayun's legs immediately trembled; he couldn't imagine how many backings Su Nantian had in this city.

Feng Yue realized it and hurriedly rushed to Su Nantian's side, seeing that the person at the classroom door was Gao Jingjing and Wu Lianxing. He stood frozen, blinking in disbelief.

Then he quickly put on a fawning smile and said to Gao Jingjing, "My apologies! I didn't know it was Miss Gao at the door. We were busy with work and didn't notice..."

Gao Jingjing had never liked Feng Yue, so she only glanced at him and said nothing. She then led Wu Lianxing to Su Nantian's side, carefully examining him.

Su Nantian naturally understood what the girl meant and smiled, "I'm not injured; you can rest easy."

Gao Jingjing blushed and lowered her head, avoiding Su Nantian's gaze. Wu Lianxing noticed the stunned Shen Huayun and smiled, "How is it? You wanted to take Su Nantian where?"

Upon realizing the two girls were from the Gao family, Shen Huayun's cold sweat poured down his forehead.

"An误会! An误会!" Shen Huayun awkwardly laughed, quickly approaching and wiping his forehead.

At this moment, Shen Huayun was utterly embarrassed.

"An误会!" Shen Huayun bowed low to Gao Jingjing, "I didn't know Mr. Su was connected with Miss Gao; it's my oversight. Please believe me, this is a misunderstanding!"

Zhang Xue heard this and felt the opportunity slipping away again. She angrily rushed forward but was pulled back by Feng Yue.

Zhang Xue glared at Feng Yue, muttering, "Why are you holding me back?"

Feng Yue smiled politely and pulled Zhang Xue aside, saying, "Madam, please assess the situation!"

Zhang Xue was hot-tempered but not foolish. She clearly saw the current situation, but she still felt indignant. Su Nantian was about to be taken back, and now Gao Jingjing and Wu Lianxing had suddenly appeared to take him.

Zhang Xue was extremely indignant and frustrated, her chest rising and falling heavily.

But since Shen Huayun had already spoken, she couldn't interfere and had to reluctantly give up.

And Shen Huayun, who had been so bold before, now had no time to care about Zhang Xue's thoughts.

He clearly knew that if he didn't explain this matter to Gao Jingjing immediately, the Shen family would have a hard time in Feng City.

So he quickly lowered his head and flattered, "If I had known Mr. Su was connected to Miss Gao, I would never have treated him like this. To be honest, I deeply respect Mr. Gao and would never oppose the Gao family!"

Gao Jingjing coldly smiled, "But Mr. Su did hit Shen Fei."

"That was my son's fault for provoking Mr. Su!" Shen Huayun quickly defended.

Hearing this, Wu Lianxing looked down on Shen Huayun even more.

Afraid his explanation wasn't convincing enough, Shen Huayun added, "It was Mr. Su who taught my son a lesson; I was previously foolish and treated Mr. Su this way!"

Shen Huayun then smiled up at Su Nantian, "Mr. Su, Mr. Su, you won't be angry with me, right? Let's call it a misunderstanding! It was my mistake!"

Su Nantian coldly smiled but said nothing.

Gao Jingjing noticed the disdain in Su Nantian's eyes and turned to Shen Huayun, saying, "Mr. Shen, since you've decided not to pursue it, what else do you need here?"

Upon hearing this, Shen Huayun felt relieved. "Nothing! I'll leave immediately; I don't want to bother you anymore!"

Shen Huayun raised his hand and greeted, then immediately ran out of the classroom door, looking utterly embarrassed.

Zhang Xue saw Shen Huayun leave and couldn't忍耐 anymore, breaking free from Feng Yue's grip to shout at the classroom door, "Mr. Shen! Are you really not going to pursue it!"

But Shen Huayun didn't respond. To be precise, there was no one to be seen outside the door now.

Zhang Xue stomped her foot in anger, and her gaze at Su Nantian grew even more furious.

Su Nantian met Zhang Xue's gaze and simply shrugged, "I told you I'd go with you; it was Shen Huayun who said to stop."

Chapter 169: Warmth

Zhang Xue was already angry about the incident. Upon hearing Su Nantian say this, she didn't care anymore and jumped out, pointing at Su Nantian and shouting, "Good! Since you're so righteous, I'll tell you! You're arrested! You must come with me today!"

This made Wu Lianxing also unable to stay calm. How could this Zhang Xue be so unreasonable? Shen Huayun had already given up, yet she still wanted to forcibly take someone.

Looking at this quiet girl, how could she be so impolite?

Zhang Xue had just stepped out to get hit, and Wu Lianxing wouldn't have felt wronged if she hadn't slapped her.

"Shen Huayun has already given up, so why are you still chasing? What right do you have to catch him?" Wu Lianxing stood up and confronted Zhang Xue. The other inspection team members watching the two women arguing quietly stopped their work to watch.

Zhang Xue saw more colleagues gathering around, her anger growing. "Mr. Shen reported the case, so we must investigate it thoroughly! Mr. Su said he would go with us, so why are you blocking me!"

Su Nantian was stunned by the two women arguing. It looked like they were quarreling over jealousy, and with Gao Jingjing in his arms, Su Nantian suddenly felt unusually happy.

"Then I'll go with you." Su Nantian said.

Zhang Xue heard Su Nantian speak up and snorted, "Then why aren't you moving faster!"

Wu Lianxing frowned at Su Nantian. Su Nantian reached out and gently touched Wu Lianxing's head to comfort her, "Since I'm willing to go, there's no danger. Now that Jingjing is here, you have even less reason to worry about me."

Wu Lianxing's cheeks turned red, and she nodded silently.

So the group went to the Inspection Team together.

Because of Gao Jingjing's presence, the head of the Inspection Team greeted them kindly before they even entered the team's gate and sent them back out.

As they left, Wu Lianxing looked at the angry Zhang Xue outside and felt an indescribable sense of joy.

Then, the Inspection Team sent someone to drive Su Nantian and his group away. The driver was a new recruit, who sat in the driver's seat nervously and looked at Su Nantian in the passenger seat, asking, "Are you going back to school?"

Su Nantian thought for a moment and shook his head, "To Fengyue Residential Area." The man nodded and started the car.

Although this new Inspection Team member was quiet, his driving skills were excellent. He overtook quickly and soon sent Su Nantian's group back to Fengyue Residential Area.

After returning home, Gao Jingjing took off her coat and said to the two people, "I'll cook; you rest for a while."

Su Nantian nodded in agreement, and Wu Lianxing also smiled and said, "Thank you."

Gao Jingjing opened the refrigerator to check the ingredients, chose Italian noodles from it, and took out the selected ingredients. Then she went to the kitchen to show off her skills.

Su Nantian changed into another set of clothes in his room; the previous one had been stained with dust from his fight with Shen Fei, so he changed into casual clothes for the afternoon class.

After Su Nantian finished these tasks, Gao Jingjing called out from the living room, "Dinner's ready."

Su Nantian suddenly felt this life was exceptionally happy.

Wu Lianxing came out of the bathroom with her hair dried, looking at the delicious food on the table and ran over happily.

"Wow, Jingjing, you're amazing." Wu Lianxing was attracted by the food and quickly grabbed a fork to take a piece of steak.

It was firm and tender, well-prepared.

Under Gao Jingjing's expectant gaze, Wu Lianxing didn't hesitate to raise her thumb in praise.

After receiving Wu Lianxing's approval, Gao Jingjing first smiled, then turned her expectant gaze to Su Nantian.

Su Nantian exchanged a glance with Gao Jingjing and immediately picked up the chopsticks on the table, taking a piece of steak to eat.

Su Nantian nodded in satisfaction. Although it wasn't as good as his own cooking, it was still quite good. He didn't hesitate to praise, "It's really delicious; thank you, Jingjing."

Gao Jingjing blushed and nodded shyly. "It's not a problem; if you like it, eat up."

The three of them pulled their chairs together and enjoyed the delicious meal Gao Jingjing had prepared.

After they finished eating, Wu Lianxing's phone alarm rang. Su Nantian and Gao Jingjing both looked at Wu Lianxing. Wu Lianxing sheepishly stuck out her tongue, took out her phone to check it, and let out a surprised exclamation. "Oh no, I have a performance to attend; there's another one in the afternoon."

Wu Lianxing had an afternoon performance to attend. To prevent forgetting, she set an alarm to remind herself.

Gao Jingjing thought for a moment and said, "I don't have classes this afternoon, so I'll stay at home to clean up the dishes. You should go quickly for your performance." She turned to Su Nantian and asked, "Do you have a military training schedule this afternoon?"

Su Nantian was helping Gao Jingjing stack the dishes. Upon hearing Gao Jingjing's question, he raised his eyebrows and replied, "Yes, originally Miss Zhu Ying had arranged for us to meet the military training instructor this afternoon."

Gao Jingjing nodded and took the stack of dishes from Su Nantian's hands. Su Nantian, however, first took them to the kitchen. Upon seeing this, Gao Jingjing quickly followed in.

As Su Nantian put the dishes into the sink, Gao Jingjing came behind him and pushed him out, saying, "Hurry to school; I can handle this myself."

Su Nantian wanted to help, but seeing Gao Jingjing's enthusiasm, he didn't insist and obediently stepped out.

Meanwhile, Wu Lianxing had already returned to her room to change into appropriate clothes and took Su Nantian's coat from the rack, waiting at the entrance for Su Nantian.

"We're leaving." Su Nantian came to the entrance and took his coat from Wu Lianxing's hands. The two said goodbye to Gao Jingjing, who was cleaning up in the kitchen, and then left.

After dropping Wu Lianxing at the performance venue, Su Nantian drove to school.

As soon as Su Nantian entered the school, he was called into Zhu Ying's office. Zhu Ying had already recovered her composure; the awkward posture she had shown earlier was gone, but there was no cheerful smile on her face.

Su Nantian entered the office and politely closed the door behind him. Upon seeing the empty office, he was stunned.

"Teacher Zhu, you called me?" Su Nantian had no interest in this quiet office and spoke first to break the silence. Zhu Ying was sitting at her desk filling out some forms. Upon hearing Su Nantian's question, she realized he was behind her.

Chapter 170: Punishment

Zhu Ying nodded and said, "I have something to talk about. Please sit."

Su Nantian immediately pulled a chair over and sat down, watching Zhu Ying quickly filling out something. Upon carefully observing, he noticed she was filling out the new student's military training manual.

After Zhu Ying finished the last one, she stood up and neatly organized the thick manuals before carrying them over to Su Nantian. Su Nantian was suddenly handed a stack of manuals and looked at Zhu Ying in confusion.

Zhu Ying remained silent for a moment before speaking, "Shen Fei was injured by you. Now the class monitor position is vacant; you'll take it."

Su Nantian's lips twitched, and he stood up to put the manuals on the table, indicating his stance. "I don't like these superficial titles."

As if anticipating Su Nantian's response, Zhu Ying wasn't in a hurry. She spoke slowly, "Today, Gao Jingjing and Wu Lianxing came to rescue you. I immediately recognized their relationship with you. Plus, Lin Suyun."

Su Nantian raised an eyebrow and didn't rush; he sat down again to listen to Zhu Ying. Upon seeing Su Nantian's silence, Zhu Ying was more certain of her judgment.

"Now I'm just asking you to clean up the mess you made. Do you refuse even this class monitor position?"

Su Nantian rubbed his nose and didn't explain, taking the stack of manuals from the table and leaving the office.

Su Nantian wasn't afraid of Zhu Ying using this to confront him; after all, the new class monitor Shen Fei hadn't even sat on his seat before Su Nantian had beaten him.

It was just a small class monitor position; it shouldn't be too troublesome.

After Su Nantian returned to the classroom with the manuals, he found it empty. He looked up at the wall clock and realized it had been forty minutes since class started.

So, was the military training already underway?

Su Nantian placed the manuals on the table and casually walked towards the playground.

From afar, he saw a crowd of people on the field; each class was divided into sections. The instructor had already arranged each class into a square formation.

Su Nantian scanned the field's formations and finally found his class in the farthest corner. He wasn't worried at all, walking slowly towards it.

The instructor of this class was angry because the number of people in the formation didn't match what Zhu Ying had reported. He asked who the class monitor was, and the students said the monitor had been hospitalized after being beaten.

The instructor's mouth twitched, becoming even more impatient with these new students.

The instructor saw someone approaching and immediately knew it was the latecomer.

When Su Nantian reached this formation, he hadn't even spoken yet when the instructor shouted, "Do you know you're late!"

Su Nantian said, "I do. What's the problem?"

"Did I tell you to speak!" The instructor quickly changed the subject, "Now you're in military training. You should prioritize your instructor's commands! But you came late on the first day of training!"

"Did I ask? What's wrong with it?"

The instructor was furious. How could this student not know the basics? What's wrong with it?

It was a big problem!

He extended his dark, sunburned hand to point at Su Nantian's forehead. "What attitude is this! You're late and still don't show remorse! Do you not know what's wrong with it?"

If Su Nantian were closer, spittle would have sprayed onto his face.

He disdainfully waved his hand to push the instructor's finger aside, not even looking at him.

"Kid, good for you." This was the first time in his years as an instructor that someone had dared to defy him. It was truly reckless; today, he wouldn't let this student off without a beating.

If it weren't for the school setting, he would have beaten Su Nantian to the ground and taught him a lesson. He hated people who had no ability but were arrogant.

He suppressed his anger and smiled, "You run 20 laps around the field and come back!"

As soon as he spoke, a murmur spread among the crowd. Twenty laps! It wasn't a small number. After all, this field was specially expanded to 800 meters per lap; most people couldn't endure running it.

Even Zhang Mengyao felt a jolt in her heart and looked at Su Nantian.

Su Nantian didn't care and shrugged, not finding these 20 laps particularly difficult. He simply put his hands in his pockets and walked towards the track, thinking this instructor was ignorant; he didn't want to waste words with him.

The instructor saw Su Nantian's slow movements and thought he was scared, feeling triumphant. He took a large step forward in front of the students and straightened his back to give a speech.

"You all saw it, right? From now on, if anyone disobeys and is late or causes any trouble, they'll get the same fate!"

Some mischievous boys looked at him with disdain.

"From now on, I am your instructor; no matter what the situation, you must report to me. Did you hear that?"

"Did you hear it!" The class responded with a gloomy and quiet voice.

"I didn't hear you!" The instructor shouted again.

"Did you hear it!" A slightly louder response came back.

The instructor nodded in satisfaction and turned to look at Su Nantian's lazy posture, thinking he could use this opportunity to discipline these little troublemakers. He pointed at Su Nantian and raised his head, saying, "This kind of useless person like him—don't say I didn't warn you; he definitely won't finish 20 laps."

Others were unhappy, thinking this was a classmate and that it would be embarrassing for them. They started arguing with the instructor.

"What do you mean, Instructor? Are you looking down on us?"

The instructor heard this and rubbed his nose, smiling. He didn't want to give them a chance to continue talking. After thinking for a moment, he said, "Let's make a bet; if he finishes 20 laps today, I'll let you deal with me!"

"If he doesn't finish, you must obey me!"

They were all young men; they couldn't resist his provocation. One of them shouted loudly, "If you lose, you have to kneel and sing 'Conquer'!"

"Exactly!"

Some mischievous girls also joined in, not wanting the situation to be too big.

Su Nantian could easily defeat Shen Fei with one punch, so 20 laps should be no problem. Plus, if he lost, they wouldn't suffer any loss; it was as if they couldn't train without this bet.

The group started talking back and forth, with no psychological burden at all.

The instructor felt a bit embarrassed; if he lost, his face would be ruined. But thinking about Su Nantian's thin build, even 10 laps would be tough. He closed his eyes and agreed.

Chapter 171: This Speed

The instructor straightened his back, looking determined. "Alright, I accept your challenge. Now let's continue with the military stance!"

"Ah~ Not again."

A chorus of complaints, but no one dared to challenge the instructor's command.

The weather in September was still hot; a fiery sun hung high in the sky, and everyone's clothes were almost soaked.

Some girls had already complained loudly; their pale faces turned red from the sun, but they dared not show it.

They stared at Su Nantian slowly walking onto the track, hands in his pockets, showing no signs of retreat.

Some people who had hoped to see him struggle also straightened up, eager to see what he was made of.

One boy took the opportunity when the instructor turned around, wiped his sweat, and muttered, "This cursed weather; standing is useless! I'm about to dehydrate, I'm dying of thirst."

The other boy nudged him with his arm. "Shh, be quiet; if you're caught, it's over!"

The boy closed his mouth and rolled his eyes.

"Who said that? Come out!" The instructor, with his hands behind him, stood behind the two and shouted at their heads.

"You two come out! Join him in running!"

The boy who spoke last was already annoyed by the sun and couldn't help but argue, "Commander, why me? I was just reminding him."

"Did I tell you to remind? Both of you run 10 laps; that's an order!"

This statement caused a stir. After all, in this hot weather, just standing was exhausting; how could they run? Although 10 laps were half of 20, these people had been spoiled at home. How could they endure such high-intensity exercise?

The two men saw no way to back out and had to leave the formation. The one who spoke said, "Sorry, brother; I'm dragging you down."

The other man shrugged and didn't say anything, resignedly running towards the track.

At this moment, Su Nantian had already run four laps; his speed hadn't slowed at all. He was like a nimble leopard, running lap after lap without slowing down and even increasing his speed.

The two men initially managed to keep up, even waving at the girls from other classes as they ran.

This caused a wave of red faces.

Everyone guessed who these two were from which class.

Su Nantian saw their actions and felt a bit amused. After running two laps, the two men's speed clearly slowed down; they had to stop and catch their breath.

When Su Nantian passed them for the fifth time, they could no longer stay calm.

The two men huddled together and whispered, "Do you think this person is a devil? How many laps has he done already and still so strong?"

"Yes... I really admire him."

In times of hardship, they no longer cared about their previous conflict and wanted to finish these laps quickly. They had no time to dwell on the earlier minor disagreement.

The instructor naturally noticed the students' impatience and knew that training on the first day shouldn't be too strict, or it would backfire. He looked at his watch and said, "Now, take a break."

The group felt like they had been saved. They no longer cared about etiquette and found a few trees with shade to rest, even if it wasn't very effective, but at least it met their psychological needs.

Some girls and Cao Yun sat together watching the people being punished on the field.

Zhang Mengyao also found a spot to sit alone, hugging her knees and watching Su Nantian run on the field.

Since they weren't far away, Cao Yun lifted her eyes and unintentionally looked at Zhang Mengyao.

At that moment, a breeze blew through, lifting Zhang Mengyao's hair, making her look like an angel who had accidentally come to the world. Cao Yun felt a shock in her heart, as she suddenly felt Zhang Mengyao was very beautiful.

This was the first time Cao Yun had looked at Zhang Mengyao so seriously, feeling that something about her was different from before. Was it her demeanor? Cao Yun didn't understand.

Zhang Mengyao felt someone was watching her and instinctively looked toward Cao Yun. She saw the girls discussing Su Nantian, so she sighed in relief and continued to watch Su Nantian.

Cao Yun felt a sense of worry; she had never experienced this feeling before. She constantly looked for Su Nantian in the crowd, even dreaming of him kissing her.

Was this what love was?

Cao Yun was startled by her own thoughts and shook her head, pretending nothing had happened. She continued to laugh with the other girls.

The two men being punished were now moving like turtles, and it was only the fourth lap. They already felt as if their bodies were about to fall apart, barely able to catch their breath.

When Su Nantian passed them again, full of energy, one of the boys waved his hand.

With all his strength, he shouted, "Su Nantian, wait up."

Su Nantian was surprised. After hearing the voice, he had already passed them by a long distance, but he eventually turned back.

"Hey, brother, how did you do it? Do you have any secrets to teach us? I really can't run anymore."

Su Nantian found it amusing but didn't deny it. These people spent all day at home as shut-ins; running a few steps and breathing heavily was normal.

Honestly, 20 laps were no pressure for him at all; it was just that he didn't want to draw too much attention, so he controlled his speed.

Twenty laps, he could finish them in a few breaths.

"Deep breathing; use your running speed."

Su Nantian left a sentence and had already run more than a hundred meters away.

This sentence was like a thunderclap in their minds.

The two men looked at each other, both seeing surprise in the other's eyes.

"Running speed!"

They thought for a moment, and their bodies suddenly felt full of strength, as if they had just taken a blue pill.

Seeing Su Nantian's lightning-fast speed, the two men kept shaking their heads in amazement. Thinking about that sentence, they felt a sense of respect for Su Nantian.

"Did you feel your body become lighter, like it was emptied?"

"Yes, I really did."

They looked at each other and saw shock in the other's eyes.

Neither of them wanted to lose, so they took off again, determinedly running forward as if the one behind was slower.

Su Nantian saw them regain their determination and smiled slightly; they had potential after all.

The instructor, seeing this from a distance, was also surprised.

These two men had suddenly shown incredible energy. According to his estimation, they could barely finish five laps.

He was curious about what Su Nantian had said to them.

Chapter 172: Explosion

"The tenth lap,"

Cao Yun wrapped her arms around her knees and whispered.

"What's the tenth lap, Cao Yun?" Her friend pushed her shoulder and teased.

"Yes, yes, what's the tenth lap?"

Cao Yun was startled back to reality and realized what she had said, quickly closing her mouth. She glanced at Zhang Mengyao's direction again, and their eyes met.

They both instinctively turned away.
