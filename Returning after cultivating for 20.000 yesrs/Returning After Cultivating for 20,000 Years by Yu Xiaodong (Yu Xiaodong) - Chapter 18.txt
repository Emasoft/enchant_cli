"Let's talk about Tang family's two sons; they're both lecherous. When Tang Qianzhan's older brother saw the two beauties, his pupils dilated and saliva flowed. Tang Qianzhan understood his brother's intention immediately and hurriedly stopped him, saying: 'What? You haven't finished fighting yet and want to run away? Tell you, go ahead and leave, but keep the two women here. I'll have fun with my brother!' One had a full bosom, the other a plump buttock—both were exquisite!"

"Because it was Tang Qianzhan's older brother, he spoke even more boldly and arrogantly."

"His eyes were fixed on Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing, looking lewdly. Even the younger brother had to look up, clearly seeing through his pants."

"He was beaten severely but learned nothing. He pointed at Su Nantian's nose and said: 'I'm talking to you! Did you hear me?'"

"Su Nantian didn't want to cause trouble, just wanted to take the two women home for dinner."

"But now it was too late. He couldn't hold back and shot a sharp glance at him, coldly saying: 'What did you say? Say it again.'"

"'I said, leave the two girls here and I'll have fun with my brother!'"

"He hadn't finished speaking when Su Nantian's fist hit Tang Qianzhan's face."

"This punch was powerful. Tang Qianzhan flipped three hundred and sixty degrees in the air before crashing to the ground."

"Of course, Tang Dazhuan couldn't let his younger brother be bullied. Without a word, he threw a punch at Su Nantian but was caught by his wrist."

"‘What? Playing sneak attacks? Are you still a decent man?’"

"Tang Dazhuan was definitely no good person. He knew the man before him was strong and couldn't fight like that, it would be too easy to lose. He grumbled: 'You're good, but the Tang family isn't someone you can mess with.'"

"The Tang family? Hmph! What trash!"

"Su Nantian swung his hand, and Tang Dazhuan's body crashed onto his brother. There was a 'howl,' and Tang Qianzhan's neck twisted, expiring."

"Tang Dazhuan's fingers trembled as he paused at his brother's nose, confirming no breath. He almost died too, face filled with disbelief."

"You... you killed my brother!"

"Su Nantian had no expression, coldly replied: 'He was still alive before. It was you who crushed him to death. I have nothing to do with it. People like him are scum; this might be the best fate.'"

"Tang Dazhuan and Tang Qianzhan were both reckless second-generation heirs. However, the two brothers had a good relationship, sharing joy and hardship together. Now that Tang Qianzhan was dead, Tang Dazhuan couldn't bear it and didn't care about the people around him. He burst into tears, sniffling and crying."

"Suddenly, the rooftop door was kicked open again. A sharp female patrol officer rushed in. Seeing Su Nantian, she showed a face of contempt and said surprised: 'It's you again!'"

"Su Nantian was also slightly shocked. He had met her twice in a day. This person was Zhang Xue from the patrol team."

"'It's you.'"

"Behind Zhang Xue were a group of fully armed officers. They immediately surrounded the rooftop. People on site all crouched down and covered their heads."

"Zhang Xue rushed over to Tang Dazhuan, tears in his eyes: 'Patrol Officer! You must do justice for me and my brother. Look at how I'm beaten, my brother... my brother was killed outright! He's dead!'"

"Zhang Xue furrowed her brows and glanced at the unconscious Tang Qianzhan."

"Take him to the hospital.'"

"She looked up at Su Nantian, who had his neck tilted. Seeing no great expression on his face, she felt puzzled."

"Su Nantian certainly had talent but wasn't the type to act recklessly. Why did he use such a deadly strike? It was strange!"

"Someone had died, this was trouble."

"Zhang Xue told her subordinates to take everyone on the rooftop away."

"Tang Dazhuan was carried out by two people, still saying: 'You patrol officers must be fair. My brother is already like this; if you cover up and hide, the Tang family won't forgive you!'"

"Su Nantian finally had a slight expression on his face, one of relief."

"He thought he had finally taken that troublemaker away."

"Zhang Xue looked at Su Nantian and the two women behind him, said: 'Come with me. Everyone's like this; you should at least explain.'"
"Su Nantian clearly knew that death wasn't a small matter, and he had been caught by the patrol team. This trip was unavoidable."

"He nodded and turned to Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing, saying: 'You two go home and wait for me. I'll be back soon.'"

"Lin Suyun shook her head, not minding others around, with red eyes: 'No, I'll go with you. It's better to have someone watch over.'"
"Gao Jingjing heard this and came closer, saying: 'Nantian brother, Suyun sister, I'll go too.'"
"Zhang Xue was sweating coldly. The patrol team was like a restaurant? Just go and leave whenever you want?"
"Zhang Xue said: 'Su Nantian, come with me. You two should go back.'"
"Zhang Xue was quite fierce; she hadn't realized it, but her heart had a slight jealousy."

Chapter Seventy-Nine: Why Him

Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing could only watch Su Nantian get into the patrol team's car, powerless.

Around them, people whispered. A woman said: "I heard that a man died on the rooftop just now. It was the one who flirted with the beautiful girl in the mall."

"Another woman, eyes full of love, said excitedly: 'I know. The person taken away was Su Nantian. He must have saved the beauty, handsome and kind. If he were my boyfriend, it would be perfect!'"

"Don't get infatuated..."

The patrol team's car gradually disappeared on the street. Lin Suyun and Gao Jingjing stood by the roadside, looking desolate. They had planned to have dinner together that night for their housewarming. But now, only they remained.

Lin Suyun frowned and said to Gao Jingjing: "Let's go home first. We'll talk at home."

"What about Nantian brother?"

"It's fine; the patrol team won't easily harm him. They'll interrogate first."

Lin and Gao went home. As soon as they arrived, Lin Suyun couldn't hold back and cried on the sofa, saying: "It's my fault. I insisted on going shopping and buying things. If I had stayed home in the afternoon, this trouble wouldn't have happened. I made Jingjing get caught by bad guys too!"

Gao Jingjing was younger but more composed. She comforted Lin Suyun gently.

"Suyun sister, this isn't your fault or Jingjing's or Nantian brother's. Blame Tang Qianzhan; he was openly indecent and spoke arrogantly. It's so unreasonable."

Gao Jingjing said this, tightly clenching her fists, face slightly red, eyes full of anger.

"Sister, I'll call Grandpa to ask how to resolve this."

Her words reminded Lin Suyun. What was the use of crying here? Su Nantian would still be detained in the patrol team. It was better to call Grandpa immediately and ask for a good solution.

Lin Suyun dialed Lin Tianyi's phone. After two rings, a warm but slightly aged voice came through: "Hehe, my precious granddaughter. Why did you call me? Did Su Nantian bully you? That's not allowed, I need to teach him."

Lin Suyun had just cried, her voice hoarse and nasal.

"Grandpa, Nantian didn't bully me. He encountered some trouble."

Lin Tianyi was extremely devoted to his granddaughter. Hearing the girl had cried, he immediately became very serious and asked her to clearly explain the situation.

After listening, Lin Tianyi sighed: "Did this person really die?"

Lin Suyun nodded, her mouth downturned, voice full of委屈.

"I don't know. But he was severely injured and might be dying. If that man hadn't come to flirt with me and Jingjing, Nantian wouldn't have done this."

"Good guy! He's a hot-blooded man!"

Lin Tianyi felt admiration. This boy had protected his granddaughter well.

"Suyun, is Nantian currently in the patrol team?"

"Yes," Lin Suyun grumbled. "He was taken away. Grandpa, do you remember? Nantian once killed someone to save us."

"That's good. But that time was secret, and the one killed was a wanted killer in China. The patrol team wouldn't have cared. But this time is different. I think I need to go to the patrol team myself."

Lin Suyun clearly knew that this time Su Nantian would not be lightly punished.

Thinking about it, she felt self-reproach and discomfort. Big tears fell down.

Lin Tianyi told Lin Suyun not to cry, had Gao's family known?

Lin Suyun looked back. Gao Jingjing was also on the phone, probably telling about today's situation, so she nodded: "They should have known."

"Good. I'll contact Gao's family. You and Jingjing don't worry, I'll call you later and come to pick you up."

After the phone call ended, Lin Suyun collapsed on the sofa. After Gao Jingjing hung up, she tightly held her hand and said determinedly: "Suyun sister, Nantian brother will definitely be fine. I've already told Grandpa, and he's working on it."

"Good."

In the large living room, two women hugged each other. Their hearts were all on the patrol team...

In the interrogation room, Su Nantian was cuffed and shackled. The small room with a hard wooden chair, he frowned without saying a word.

Zhang Xue just arrived at the interrogation room door and saw her colleague come out of the room.

The person had a helpless look, hands on his hips, angry and breathing heavily.

"What's going on? What's the situation inside?"

Zhang Xue looked at her file folder, she would have to make another statement.

The person sighed and had a look of gritting his teeth.

"I'll tell you, the man inside is like a stone in the toilet!"

Zhang Xue furrowed her brows: "What does that mean?"

"Smelly and hard!"

"Pu," Zhang Xue laughed. She told her colleague to rest first, and she would handle the difficult person inside.

Zhang Xue entered the interrogation room. Su Nantian was looking at the table without expression.

She coughed lightly and said: "What? Being silent?"

Su Nantian looked up, saw Zhang Xue coming over and sitting across from him. She had a stack of files in her hand. He said: "What's the situation at the hospital?"

"Still unclear. Tang Qianzhan is still in the emergency room. Whether he's alive or not."

"Ah."

"Why did you attack him?"

"That was what he deserved!"

Zhang Xue shrugged: "Then just stay here."

Su Nantian asked: "What do you want to do with me?"

"Neither will trouble you. But according to your situation, it's either bad or not."

"What about me?"

"Of course, it's bad."

Su Nantian rolled his eyes and said nothing.

Zhang Xue was silent for a while, then went out briefly. When she returned, she had a lunch box and a bottle of water in her hand. She casually placed them on the table, saying: "Eat and drink, so they won't say we have no humanity."

Su Nantian was hungry. After all that commotion, he didn't refuse and took the chopsticks to eat.

Zhang Xue couldn't help but smile, shaking her head.

Unknowingly, this scene was all seen by Wu Jun. He clenched his fists tightly and gritted his teeth.

"Su Nantian!"

Zhang Xue was the goddess he had longed for. Yet she even brought food to this little rascal!

He thought about it, he had been by Zhang Xue's side for years. Had he ever received such treatment?

What gave him the right!

The more he thought, the angrier he became. Wu Jun vowed in his heart that Su Nantian would not have an easy time!

Chapter Eighty: Yang Yuanlong

A long Lincoln car stopped at the patrol team's entrance. An elderly man in a traditional Chinese outfit stepped out of the car.

He wore a traditional robe, his face serious and mannerisms outstanding. Behind him were two beauties: one was Gao Jingjing, the other Lin Suyun.

Yes, this old man was Lin Suyun's grandfather, Lin Tianyi.

Gao Qingyun had some trouble and would come later. So only Lin's old man came first.

The two women looked worried, especially Lin Suyun, her eyes red.

"Grandpa, are you sure it'll work?" Lin Suyun asked.

Lin Tianyi looked at the door without much expression, his hands behind his back. He said: "Don't worry. That boy is lucky and won't have problems."

"Yes, there's no problem when Grandpa comes," Lin Suyun said.

They walked into the patrol team. At that moment, Su Nantian was being interrogated like a bombardment.

"Speak!" A harsh and serious voice came out, "Your killing process!"

Su Nantian remained silent, saying nothing.

After Zhang Xue left the interrogation room, Wu Jun came in. He wanted to see what talent this man had that he could subdue Zhang Xue, the ice beauty! And even brought her food!

Wu Jun saw Su Nantian didn't respond, he smiled darkly.

No talk?

Good!

Then don't blame me for being unkind. After all, no one was in the interrogation room now. Su Nantian was just like a piece of meat for him to deal with!

Wu Jun sat across from Su Nantian, his attitude very arrogant. He raised an eyebrow and said: "You know, your behavior was extremely bad and you'll be sentenced."

Su Nantian still said nothing.

Wu Jun couldn't sit still. Was he acting alone here?

"Su Nantian!" He slammed the table hard, his eyes bulging out with bloodshot veins. "Confess and be lenient, resist and be strict. Tell the truth, you might still get a favor."

"Hmph!"

Su Nantian sneered and said nothing else.

At this moment, Su Nantian saw Wu Jun like a jumping clown disturbing his peace. He didn't want to respond and closed his eyes, ignoring the man in front of him.

"Are you mute or deaf? Didn't you hear me speaking to you?"

Wu Jun couldn't take it. His hand slammed the table, leaning forward. The breath he exhaled hit Su Nantian's head, making his hair sway.

Seeing Su Nantian still didn't speak, Wu Jun couldn't take it. His lungs were almost exploded. He ignored the team's rules about not touching suspects in interrogation rooms and raised his hand to slap Su Nantian's face.

His hand hadn't fallen yet, a strong wind came. The next second, Wu Jun's hand was caught by Su Nantian.

"You...?"

Wu Jun opened his eyes in disbelief. His hand was caught by Su Nantian tightly.

A sharp gaze shot at him, making his scalp numb.

"How did you break free from the shackles?"

Silver chains fell to the ground, with a big gap torn open.

Su Nantian couldn't take it anymore. This man was too annoying, like a fly buzzing around.

"Tell you!" Su Nantian said without expression, but with a fierce look in his eyes. "I'm currently in the patrol team; I have to respect Zhang Xue, so I can't do anything to you. I also advise you to stay away from me. Otherwise, no matter where I am, I'll sew your mouth shut one by one!"

Wu Jun was scared.

This man wasn't someone he could deal with. His powerful aura and霸道 strength were beyond him.

Sweat dripped from Wu Jun's cheeks. He swallowed, his lips trembling.

"Knew it... I'm leaving now."

"Yes."

Su Nantian sighed and let him go. He continued to sit calmly on the chair, looking down at the table, thinking about Lin and Gao's two girls. He wondered if they had eaten after returning home. This matter definitely scared them.

Wu Jun didn't want to stay, being in the same room as Su Nantian was like being with a dragon or tiger. His life was in danger.

Although he wasn't satisfied, it was better to leave first.

Ten years east, ten years west. A man's revenge doesn't fear a few days...

The director's office of the patrol team.

Lin Tianyi walked in with two beauties. Feng Yue was busy handling a case. Hearing the cough, he frowned and looked up. Seeing Lin's old man had come, his face immediately showed a smile. He hurriedly said: "Old Lin has come to my place? It's truly a blessing. Why didn't you call me earlier, so I could prepare and welcome you properly."

Lin Tianyi shook his head: "No need. We came here for an important matter."

Feng Yue was stunned. What kind of matter could make this old man come? It was truly unimaginable.

Even if the sky collapsed, it wouldn't be more than this.

"Director Feng, I came here for Su Nantian."

Su Nantian? This name had a little memory in Zhang Xiaotian's mind. He had just entered the interrogation room, and the person beaten was still alive or dead.

"For him?"

Lin Tianyi nodded: "Yes, that boy I know. He wouldn't attack people without reason. This case needs to be handled carefully."

Lin Tianyi's voice wasn't high, but it was firm. Zhang Xiaotian couldn't help but shiver.

This big boss had come, and he said this. It was definitely to protect the person. But the one beaten was Tang's second son, it was really a trouble!

Feng Yue showed an unhappy expression and sighed: "Senior, I have to tell you this matter is really hard to handle."

"Ah?"

Everyone furrowed their brows.

"If it was just the patrol team, there wouldn't be a problem. But the city's leaders also know about it. They'll probably come soon. I can't decide here..."

Lin Tianyi knew that if the city's leaders came, Feng Yue couldn't make a decision. It seemed they had to wait for the city's leaders.

But Lin Tianyi was unsure, he hadn't met this leader before. He thought they had to wait for Gao Qingyun.

This matter was very important, as it happened at the top mall and caused public panic. The media also broadcasted repeatedly. So the city's leader Yang Yuanlong came in person.

Yang Yuanlong was just over thirty, and he had become the city's leader at a young age. Naturally, his strength was not ordinary.

Because he was a new leader, he had been setting fire everywhere and vowed to clean up the city.

This time, when he saw Lin Tianyi, he was a bit difficult. He was an old veteran of the city, with a strong family and sufficient funds, so he couldn't be touched.

Chapter Eighty-One: City Leader Yang Yuanlong

To be honest, Lin Tianyi wasn't very familiar with Yang Yuanlong. He just knew the old leader had stepped down, and he was newly appointed, young but talented.

Now that he saw him, it was indeed so.

Elegant and outstanding, although his height wasn't high.

Yang Yuanlong wore a pair of glasses with gold edges. His eyes beneath the glasses sparkled with sharpness. He hurriedly greeted and said: "Old Lin, how did you come here?"

Lin Tianyi smiled and pointed to Feng Yue beside him: "I came to do some business with Captain Feng. It's a joy to meet the new one!"

"Without any doubt, I'll rely on your support in the future."

"Don't be so polite," Lin Tianyi waved his hand. "We're all old men now. The city belongs to your young people in the future."

Yang Yuanlong had never met this elder before. He only heard of him commanding various circles. Now that he saw him, his strength was not ordinary and his personality was also kind. He felt more confident. In this era, it's hard to find such people. If he wanted to establish himself in the city, he had to rely on the city's forces; otherwise, it would be hard to get by!

After some small talk, Lin Tianyi learned that Yang Yuanlong was indeed outstanding.

He was a son of a prestigious family in Yanjing. No wonder he could sit at this position so young.

Three people sat down, and Lin Tianyi said: "Director Yang came here for Su Nantian's matter?"

Yang Yuanlong nodded and replied: "Yes, Su Nantian beat someone. This incident caused some panic, so I came to check the situation."

"But..." Lin Tianyi made a sharp turn and continued: "I also want to tell you, I came here with Old Gao for Su Nantian."

"Ah?"

Yang Yuanlong frowned, his eyes flickered. He immediately understood that the two of them were here to protect Su Nantian.

He said: "Since Old Lin has come, I naturally have to give him face. But this incident is bad and needs to be handled by the patrol team."

Yang Yuanlong's move was smooth, directly pushing the problem to Feng Yue.

Feng Yue was a small team leader. But in these people, he was just a little shrimp. About Su Nantian's matter, he really couldn't decide.

At the same time, Yang Yuanlong was very curious. What kind of person was Su Nantian? He could make Lin's old man come to the patrol team. Yang Yuanlong thought, he had seen two beauties at the entrance. Maybe they were the old man's granddaughters, and these two were Su Nantian's lovers?

Yang Yuanlong thought more and more confused. Finally, he gave up and would ask later.

Feng Yue hesitated. Both sides were hard to offend.

He was also upset, what day was today? So many "gods" came here. It really pushed him to the edge.

Feng Yue took a deep breath and asked: "At this moment, it's still unclear. How about we call up the surveillance video to see?"

Everyone nodded.

The video was the truth, it should be seen.

In the surveillance room, Lin Tianyi sat on a chair. Feng Yue and Yang Yuanlong stood beside him. The two girls also wanted to come in, but they were arranged in the rest room.

This mall was the best in the city and also luxurious. Even the surveillance was recorded with sound, so it was color.

When the image came out, Yang Yuanlong noticed a man dressed simply but with an overwhelming aura. Even through the lens, he had a fierce look.

"South Tian," Lin Tianyi said.

Yang Yuanlong asked him: "Is this Su Nantian?"

"Yes."

He carefully watched, and he felt that the man had a grand appearance and determined eyes. He would definitely achieve great things in the future. It seemed he needed to get along well with him.

While watching, the boy suddenly shouted out.

He spoke vulgarities and said extremely indecent things. Most importantly, he had spoken such disgraceful words to their granddaughters.

Lin Tianyi was red-faced and neck-red. Especially seeing the boy had reacted, he gritted his teeth.

He had heard from his granddaughter before, but seeing it with his own eyes was still angry.

Lin Tianyi thought about telling Gao Qingyun later. No matter which family's son it was, he would make him suffer!

It was no wonder Su Nantian used a deadly strike. This man was clearly a pervert, eyeing their granddaughters. It was too despicable.

Next came Su Nantian's personal performance, knocking everyone down.

When the fist hit Tang Qianzhan's face, both old men felt a rush of joy.

This man was purely deserved!

Yang Yuanlong carefully watched Su Nantian's every move. He remembered all the camera shots. This Su Nantian was truly a tough guy, no wonder Lin and Gao's old men were so fond of him. He was really outstanding.

After watching the video, there came news from the patrol team.

The patrol squad did an investigation in the mall. Through public statements, it was indeed Tang Qianzhan who first disrespected the two women and wanted to touch them. Su Nantian came, but he still didn't repent and deliberately provoked Su Nantian, even calling people to surround him.

Feng Yue was very angry. Tang Qianzhan was too rotten!

But Tang Qianzhan's side didn't know he was dead, and the patrol team couldn't let him go. They had to委屈 Su Nantian in the interrogation room for a while.

After watching the video, Yang Yuanlong couldn't help but nod and said: "Old Lin, Su Nantian's skills are good."

Hearing Yang Yuanlong's praise, Lin Tianyi felt pride and nodded repeatedly. It was indeed good.

The four people basically understood the process. Just as they were about to see Su Nantian, someone reported that the Tang family had arrived and was waiting in the lobby.

The four people just arrived at the lobby when they saw a well-dressed old man rushing over.

He saw Yang Yuanlong and Feng Yue, immediately said angrily: "Director Yang, Captain Feng. My eldest son and third son were beaten. The third son is in the emergency room, still unknown if he's alive or dead. In broad daylight and under the clear sky, someone beat my son like this! Is Su Nantian here? Let me go find him and get it back!"

Yang and Feng said nothing, calmly watching the old man. Lin Tianyi was present, and he had just seen that surveillance video. He didn't know what to say.

The old man glanced at Lin Tianyi standing beside him, narrowed his eyes and looked carefully. He said: "I'm Tang Wensheng. Who are you..."

"Cough cough!"

Lin Tianyi coughed twice.

"Name Lin, surname Tianyi."

The name "Lin Tianyi" was well-known in the city. After hearing it, Tang Wensheng thought carefully and felt a slight stir.

The boss of the Lin family came here?

Chapter Eighty-Two: Waiting for Gao Qingyun

"Long have I heard of your name, Master Lin. It's a pleasure to meet you today. But I wonder why you also have time to come to the patrol team?"

Businessmen value harmony.

No matter what occasion, it's always better to be polite first.

"Polite. Who are you?" Lin Tianyi also had reason and basis.

"I am Tang Wensheng. I now run a furniture chain business in Jiangzhou and have some operations here in Fengcheng."

Tang Wensheng spoke about his business, with a sense of pride on his face.

"Is it you who is the boss of Tang family furniture?"

Lin Tianyi had heard of Tang Wensheng's company and now confirmed it.

"Senior, you're joking. It is indeed me."

Tang Wensheng said while stroking his white beard.

Two old men were chatting, like business partners.

Unknowingly, this was a calm before the storm.

"Captain Feng, I want to bail out Su Nantian. What procedures do I need to follow?" Lin Tianyi asked directly.

Feng Yue was about to speak, but Tang Wensheng wasn't happy.

"Wait. I didn't ask your opinion, Mr. Lin."

"You know this Su Nantian beat my two sons. One was seriously injured, the other is almost dead. Now you say you want to bail him out?"

Tang Wensheng's eyes were red now.

He completely lost the polite attitude he had before.

Lin Tianyi now knew that this Tang Wensheng was Tang Qianzhan's father.

He looked at Tang Wensheng with white hair and thought: "This Tang Qianzhan isn't old, but he's still young."

Lin Tianyi didn't know that Tang Wensheng had a son in his old age, so he loved him very much.

That's why Tang Qianzhan was so arrogant. As the saying goes, he was spoiled.

When you go out to play, you have to pay. Like Gao Qiguang, he met Su Nantian and was completely at the end of his rope.

"Mr. Tang, you said your son was beaten by Su Nantian."

"But the surveillance video Captain Feng showed me, it was your son who first flirted with my granddaughter."

"He's a man who欺负 two girls, and it's shameful!"

Lin Tianyi said this and coughed angrily.

He couldn't imagine what would have happened if Su Nantian hadn't been there. Lin Suyun could have faced unimaginable things.

Tang Wensheng heard Lin Tianyi's words and felt he was at a disadvantage. But thinking of his son Tang Qianzhan's bloodied face, anger couldn't be controlled.

"Regardless, my son didn't cause any real harm to your granddaughter. But Su Nantian beating my son seriously is a fact!"

At this moment, Lin Tianyi looked at Feng Yue standing beside him.

He hoped he could help explain from the correct level. But Feng Yue looked helpless.

After all, in such matters, it's a matter of both sides having their own reasons. He felt that as a small patrol team squad leader, he had no weight in front of these two elders.

Lin Tianyi thought: "Why hasn't Gao Qingyun come yet? He also considers Su Nantian as his son-in-law, right?"

Although Lin Tianyi didn't want to admit it, in this city, Gao's family was the most powerful and solid.

But thinking about his granddaughter and Su Nantian's relationship, he felt that in the future, Lin family could also catch up and surpass Gao family.

While Lin Tianyi was stuck in the situation, a middle-aged man in blue clothes came to the patrol team.

Gao Peng was dispatched by Gao Qingyun to come and understand the situation first.

Meanwhile, Gao Qingyun himself went to Zhang Xue's father Zhang Xiaotian's patrol headquarters.

After all, he lived in the city of Fengcheng. He had to give the patrol team enough face.

He couldn't directly overstep his authority just because of his strength.

Gao Qingyun had climbed through years. His strength was one aspect, but more importantly, he understood rules and had solid character.

Seeing Lin Tianyi, Gao Peng greeted first.

"Old Master Lin, I am Gao Peng from the Gao family. My master is currently in contact with Captain Zhang at the patrol headquarters and will come soon."

Gao Peng respectfully said to Lin Tianyi.

Hearing that Gao Qingyun would come soon, Lin Tianyi felt like he had taken a calming pill.

As a member of the Gao family, Gao Peng also didn't lack etiquette. He replaced Gao Qingyun to greet Yang Yuanlong and Feng Yue.

Feng Yue was surprised, while Yang Yuanlong felt touched by the Gao family's magnanimity.

"Everyone, I think we should stop standing here."

"Let's go to the rest room and sit down. When Master Gao comes, we can discuss this matter."

Feng Yue suggested as the host.

Tang Wensheng wanted to say, "What's there to discuss?" but thinking of the Gao family's strength, he had to swallow his words.

"Even if Gao Qingyun is big, he can't openly cover up."

Tang Wensheng thought Gao Qingyun came because of his friendship with Lin Tianyi.

He didn't know that the small beauty with Lin Suyun was actually Gao Qingyun's granddaughter, Gao Jingjing.

He only thought that Gao Jingjing was a good friend of Lin Suyun who went out shopping.

It turned out that it was thanks to Gao Jingjing coming out with Lin Suyun today.

If it had been Lin Suyun and Yao Lina, the situation wouldn't have been so easy to handle.

Feng Yue arranged for three old men and Yang Yuanlong to sit in the rest room, served tea for them.

Then he called Zhang Xue over to brief her on the situation.

"Captain Feng, do you think Su Nantian won't have real trouble this time?"

Zhang Xue now had no trace of the anger she usually showed when talking about Su Nantian. Her tone was full of concern.

"Little Snow, you don't need to worry. When Gao Qingyun and your father come, this matter won't be hard to resolve."

Feng Yue comforted her.

Zhang Xue then felt she had been out of line. Her face turned red and said: "I, I didn't worry about that annoying guy."

"I just think he's so annoying and always causes trouble for the patrol team. I'm tired of him. Let's finish this matter quickly."

Seeing his subordinates being stubborn, Feng Yue just smiled and didn't tease him anymore.

"Captain Feng, I'll go back to talk to Su Nantian again. Maybe he'll soften his attitude."

"Perhaps he'll make some concessions, and this matter will be easier to resolve."

After saying that, Zhang Xue went to the interrogation room.

Hearing that Gao Qingyun would come to the team, Zhang Xue and Lin Tianyi felt the same: a sense of relief.

But thinking again, she had some jealousy rising.

"Hmph! This heartless guy. When he got into trouble, his little girlfriends' grandfathers all came to rescue him. He's really a despicable guy!"

Zhang Xue thought of Su Nantian and immediately turned into an idiot and a jealous person.

Any woman related to Su Nantian, she found unappealing.

When she arrived at the interrogation room and saw Su Nantian meditating, she said: "Hey, I want to tell you that Gao Qingyun, the head of the Gao family, will come to the patrol team soon. You're saved."

Zhang Xue immediately returned to her proud and tough girl image.

"Oh," Su Nantian didn't even open his eyes, just gave a simple response.

Chapter Eighty-Three: The Jealousy Pot Spilled

"What attitude is this? Gao Jingjing, the granddaughter of Grandpa Gao, isn't she also your little girlfriend?"

"You're so calm even though your grandfather came to save you!"

Zhang Xue was angry again.

Actually, Zhang Xue's anger wasn't because Su Nantian didn't care about Gao Qingyun coming.

Gao Qingyun had nothing to do with her, and she didn't need to be angry at Gao Qingyun.
