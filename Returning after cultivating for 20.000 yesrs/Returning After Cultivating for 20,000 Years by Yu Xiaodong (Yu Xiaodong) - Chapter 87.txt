Thus, the members of the secret organization approached one by one with feigned confidence, holding a nebulous bid proposal document and expounding their company's stance.

"Enough," Su Nantian suddenly patted Li Hounian on the shoulder, who sat beside him, and said.

"Me?" Li Hounian looked astonished, for initially this task was meant for Wen Ran.

"Yes," Su Nantian sighed, "I forgot to tell you—Wen Ran had a cold and her voice was hoarse; she couldn't go on stage. Just recite it as is." With that, Su Nantian handed Li Hounian the proposal document from Wen Ran's bag.

"But... I haven't prepared anything. If I suddenly go up, I don't know what to say. What if it affects the bidding outcome?" Li Hounian still hesitated.

"I said it's fine! Why are you still talking? Go up!" Su Nantian impatiently replied, then tossed the bid document into Li Hounian's arms. This time, Li Hounian was truly in a bind; seeing Su Nantian's demeanor, there seemed no room for negotiation. He could only resign himself to holding the bid document, realizing he would have to take the stage.

"Next, we welcome the representative of Ti Hao Group," the host said after the previous companies had spoken.

Li Hounian could only steel his resolve and step forward.

Meanwhile, Zhang Feng and Wang Ruichang on the other side wore expressions of disdain. Naturally unaware of anything, they assumed Su Nantian was particularly favoring Li Hounian, hence granting him this opportunity to shine.

After Li Hounian took the stage and glanced down, he discovered Qi Yinzhen sitting in the first row. At that moment, Qi Yinzhen clapped for him, wearing an enigmatic smile.

Li Hounian saw Qi Yinzhen smiling at him and thought it was a reference to their previous dealings in school. However, he did not know that Qi Yinzhen was smiling because he knew Li Hounian would soon be punished by Su Nantian, marking his final days of ease.

Li Hounian could only force himself to recite the bid document, adding some of his own ideas about this bidding conference. He believed he had spoken well and could account to Su Nantian.

As Li Hounian recited, he noticed a passage in the document instructing him to introduce the subsequent PowerPoint presentation.

Thus, Li Hounian followed the instructions: "Regarding everything I just said, our company has a reasonable plan. Please now watch our completed PowerPoint presentation."

After Li Hounian spoke, the entire hall's lights dimmed. The large screen slowly descended from the front, and the projector cast the computer's contents onto it.

But what was played was not a PowerPoint or Ti Hao Group's plan, but a video.

Chapter 422: Acting

The screen displayed not just any video, but one of Li Hounian's previous conversation with Qi Yinzhen in a room. It clearly showed Li Hounian's face as he handed Qi Yinzhen a USB drive containing Ti Hao Group's bidding information.

"What! What is this? Turn it off immediately! Who did this? This isn't me, Chairman, listen to my explanation!" Li Hounian rushed toward the screen, attempting to block the video with his body, but it was futile.

Su Nantian and Wen Ran sat below, watching Li Hounian's frantic and panicked demeanor. Though Li Hounian was an old man, his clumsy actions on stage were truly laughable.

Li Hounian, still trying to block the video's playback, shouted toward Su Nantian: "Chairman, this is defamation! Please don't believe this video—it's unknown who filmed it!"

After Li Hounian spoke, he suddenly glanced at Qi Yinzhen sitting in the first row. Qi Yinzhen was smiling, his expression clearly insidious.

Li Hounian immediately understood—this matter was surely tied to Qi Yinzhen. He rushed down, grabbed Qi Yinzhen's wrist, and shouted toward Su Nantian: "Chairman, it's him! It's all his doing! He set a trap for me to damage your relationship with me and incite discord between us. This man is our competitor in this bidding conference. Please don't believe him!"

Li Hounian's words were heartfelt, nearly performing a tearful display.

Qi Yinzhen could only suppress his laughter and sit there, accompanying Su Nantian in acting out this play.

At that moment, Zhang Feng and Wang Ruichang sitting beside Su Nantian and Wen Ran were stunned. They had no idea what was happening, but upon seeing the video on the screen, they recognized another person involved—Qi Yinzhen, who had previously given them business cards.

"Chairman, I know the other person in this video. Yesterday, you told us to investigate independently. This man approached me and gave me a business card. He's the president of a technology company, asking me to provide our bidding conference information. I never agreed, but Li Hounian apparently couldn't resist temptation and fell into his trap. I'm truly sorry for the company."

Wang Ruichang spoke while feigning deep sorrow, as if genuinely heartbroken. Yet who didn't know he was ganging up on Li Hounian? He aimed to stoke the fire further.

At that moment, Zhang Feng also refused to be left behind, nodding and saying: "Chairman, I met this man yesterday too. He also asked me for the same thing, but I refused. I never expected Li Hounian, who's been with our company for years, to falter in such a situation. It's truly regrettable."

Su Nantian listened, suppressing his urge to laugh but forcing himself down. If he laughed now, it would be too early to expose the ruse.

Meanwhile, Li Hounian continued struggling, shouting at Qi Yinzhen: "Stand up! Come with me to the Chairman and explain everything you want to know about our company's bidding information. Clear my name!"

Qi Yinzhen, hearing this, was overjoyed but had to restrain himself. He never expected Li Hounian's audacity to be so thick, matching his name perfectly.

At that time, Qi Yinzhen had only subtly hinted at his intentions. It was Li Hounian who had willingly fallen into the trap, then mysteriously rushed to meet Qi Yinzhen the next morning. Now Li Hounian was claiming Qi Yinzhen had lured him.

Qi Yinzhen pretended to pull Li Hounian, but Li Hounian dragged him up and followed him to Su Nantian.

"Chairman, this man is despicable! He wanted our company's bidding information! I suggest we immediately call the investigators to punish him!" Li Hounian spoke with righteous indignation. If Su Nantian hadn't known the truth, he might have been deceived by this man's words.

"I think I should arrest you too," Su Nantian coldly said, staring at the screen. "You've already handed over our information to him."

"This... I was forced! If I didn't do it, my life would be in danger. Please, Chairman, think carefully!" Li Hounian continued to defend himself, still believing someone was after him and hoping Su Nantian would grant him a chance.

"Stop talking, Li Hounian. We've clearly seen it. This video shows the transaction process clearly. You did give him the USB drive containing our company's bidding materials."

After saying this, Su Nantian looked at Qi Yinzhen and said: "Sir, your company's actions were indeed unscrupulous. However, if you can provide evidence, I might consider not pursuing this matter."

In reality, Qi Yinzhen's actions fell under private disputes. Li Hounian, who had handed over the company's materials, was truly violating laws and would face punishment.

"Good, I'm willing to cooperate. This USB drive is here; I haven't destroyed the information yet. I'll give you this USB drive, and you handle the rest," Qi Yinzhen said, then took out the USB drive from his pocket and placed it on Su Nantian's table.

Qi Yinzhen followed the plan he had agreed with Su Nantian—setting up a trap to take down Li Hounian, which was an essential step.

Su Nantian took the USB drive from his desk and handed it to Zhang Feng, saying: "Open it. Does it contain Ti Hao Group's bidding information and our proposal?"

Zhang Feng nodded with a smile. This was the perfect opportunity to ganged up on his rival.

Zhang Feng inserted the USB drive into the computer, and indeed, it contained Ti Hao Group's bidding information. These materials had been deliberately left unhidden by Su Nantian; the three attendees each received a copy, so Li Hounian naturally had one.

"Chairman, look... this is indeed our bidding information. Li Hounian actually did this treachery! I think we can't keep him anymore; he must be severely punished!" Zhang Feng pointed at the screen, while Wang Ruichang nodded vigorously. Though he said nothing, his agreement was evident.

Su Nantian naturally knew the USB drive would contain bidding information, but he had to feign ignorance. He appeared angry and surprised, pointing at Li Hounian then the screen: "Li Hounian, speak. Now that evidence is clear, what else do you have to say? You handed over our company's materials to our competitor, Ti Hao Group. Although they've changed bosses, I've treated you well these past months. Yet you did this!"

Previously, Li Hounian would have quickly refuted it, but now with the USB drive exposed, he had no words. He could only stand there低头, unsure what to say.

"Enough," Su Nantian said, "I think this bidding conference has no more to do with Ti Hao Group. Let's leave and deal with this matter first." Saying that, Su Nantian stood up and glanced at Qi Yinzhen.

That glance was a signal for Qi Yinzhen to wrap up the fake bidding conference, while Su Nantian would handle Li Hounian.

Qi Yinzhen nodded slightly, indicating he understood. At this moment, everyone's attention was on Li Hounian, so no one noticed Su Nantian and Qi Yinzhen's interaction.

Su Nantian immediately called Li Hounian, Wang Ruichang, and Zhang Feng into his room. Su Nantian and Wen Ran sat on the sofa, while Wang Ruichang and Zhang Feng stood like door gods beside them, facing Li Hounian.

After a while, Su Nantian finally spoke: "Li Hounian, what's the truth? I need an explanation. What did he offer you to give him this information?"

Su Nantian was obviously asking with knowledge, as he had planned everything, including Qi Yinzhen's lines. He knew exactly what conditions were offered.

Li Hounian took a deep breath and said: "He offered me five million, just to give him this information. I didn't need to do anything else, and he didn't guarantee the winner would be his company. This simple transaction was tempting; five million for a single document is obviously good."

After hearing this, Su Nantian was surprised. Li Hounian still lied at this point. In reality, what mattered to Li Hounian was Qi Yinzhen's promise to introduce him to local contacts and resources in Daocheng, giving him the confidence to start anew after leaving Ti Hao Group.

"Li Hounian, are you calling me a fool? Five million could buy you? You're at least a business director in Ti Hao Group. Five million is a small number for you. This position has the most resources, and five million is something you could easily overlook? If you don't tell the truth now, we'll immediately call the investigators. I originally wanted to show mercy for your years of service with Ti Hao Group, but if you insist on this, I won't be kind or merciful!"

Su Nantian's intimidation was top-notch. His few sentences immediately confused Li Hounian, and with his strong voice, it shocked Li Hounian. He was now intimidated.

"Exactly! Your position has the most resources. How could you do this for five million? He must have offered you more! Tell the truth, or it'll be too shameful to get caught by the investigators. If you cooperate now, maybe you can live a better life later. Think carefully!" Wang Ruichang quickly added, acting as a toady.

Chapter 423: Intimidation

"Say... say, if I speak up, will you not send me to the investigators?" Li Hounian looked up and asked cautiously, clearly very concerned about being prosecuted.

"You see, you're the one who made a mistake, yet you still have so many conditions and demands. You're really shameless!" Wang Ruichang said again.

But at this moment, Zhang Feng sitting beside Su Nantian didn't speak, just sat there watching.

Su Nantian glanced at Zhang Feng with the corner of his eye, then looked at Wen Ran and gave her a meaningful look. Although Wen Ran didn't fully understand Su Nantian's intention, she could guess that Zhang Feng was suspicious.

"First, speak up. After you do, we'll discuss this matter. But if you lie or hide something, I will immediately send you to the investigators," Su Nantian frowned and said.

Li Hounian nodded, then began to confess: "This is true. He did offer me other conditions, but five million was real. However, for me, five million is just a cover. He promised to introduce me to contacts in Daocheng, so I agreed."

"Contacts? What do you need them for?" Before Su Nantian could speak, Wang Ruichang asked again. It was clear this man had a poor relationship with Li Hounian and wouldn't hesitate to interfere at this moment.

"To start my own business, of course. I've been planning to leave Ti Hao Group for a while now. As the business director, if I successfully break away, I could take most of Ti Hao Group's orders. But before, even though Ti Hao Group was under Leng Boxiong's control and had internal conflicts, people still got along on the surface. Now it's different; Ti Hao Group has a new chairman, and your high-ranking officials are already stirring. Did I say that right?"

This matter was initially discovered by Wen Ran, so when she spoke about it, she talked confidently as if she had detailed knowledge.

After hearing this, Li Hounian was stunned. He hadn't intended to say so much at first; he just wanted to say he had been tempted by contacts and wanted to create more profit, not that he intended to steal Ti Hao Group's business and leave.

But he hadn't expected Wen Ran knew so clearly about this matter.

"To hide a crime, one must not act; isn't it strange how Wen Ran found out? Actually, she had already discovered that someone among you was harboring ill intentions and wanted to take advantage of Ti Hao Group's current instability to leave with its resources. This time, it was a coincidence that you exposed your mistake so quickly. Ha!"

Su Nantian stood up and walked to Li Hounian's side, saying: "How do you feel? Are you shocked? Whether or not I send you to the investigators depends on your choice. Just see how you choose."

Li Hounian looked into Su Nantian's eyes, which were like deep oceans with no horizon. He had been in business for over a decade but couldn't fathom Su Nantian's intentions at this moment.

But Li Hounian knew this man was definitely dangerous and couldn't fight him. Now, he should choose to compromise; as long as he could avoid being prosecuted by the investigators, he would agree to anything.

So Li Hounian quickly nodded: "I agree! I agree! Whatever the conditions, I'll accept. Tell me!"

Zhang Feng and Wang Ruichang sat behind, their eyes automatically narrowing. They had known Li Hounian for over five years and often clashed with each other, mutually despising but acknowledging each other's qualifications as opponents.

But now Li Hounian had been defeated completely by Su Nantian, leaving no chance to fight back. This made them immediately realize that Su Nantian was truly not someone to mess with.

At first, they thought Ti Hao Group's change of leadership was due to Leng Boxiong's old age and foolishness, giving up such a big business. But now it seemed everything might have been under Su Nantian's control.

Thinking about this, the two men felt a chill on their backs. As long as they weren't fully prepared to confront Su Nantian, they definitely couldn't be as foolish as Li Hounian.

After hearing Li Hounian's choice, Su Nantian smiled and patted his shoulder: "Ti Hao Group definitely can't keep you. Before leaving, you must hand over all your business materials one by one and let my people take them over. Can you do that?"

After hearing this, Zhang Feng and Wang Ruichang inhaled sharply. Business handover, one by one personally—this meant Su Nantian's people would fully take over Ti Hao Group's business. They couldn't help but curse Li Hounian in their hearts; it was because of his greed that Ti Hao Group's biggest opportunity had been taken over by Su Nantian.

Moreover, this position also affected them both. A financial director and a human resources director were closely related to business. If Su Nantian's people took over, it would be difficult for them to profit here.

"I... I understand..." After saying this, Li Hounian sighed deeply.

He naturally didn't want to do it, but he knew his refusal was useless. If he refused, Su Nantian would send him to the investigators. Now, he could at least keep his freedom by handing over all business materials and contacts; it wasn't a loss.

But Li Hounian still felt reluctant, as he had accumulated so many contacts over the years in Ti Hao Group. He had planned to use them for his own business, but now he had to give them up. This would be hard for anyone to let go of.

Chapter 424: Traces

After seeing Li Hounian's compromise, Su Nantian was delighted, knowing his goal had been achieved. This wasn't just about eliminating Li Hounian, who had ill intentions in Ti Hao Group, but also using this opportunity to reclaim important business management power within Ti Hao Group under his control.

This was a complete victory for Su Nantian.

However, besides Li Hounian's discomfort, Zhang Feng and Wang Ruichang sitting beside Su Nantian and Wen Ran also felt conflicted. They were happy to see Li Hounian suffer, but they also felt some worry upon realizing that Ti Hao Group's business would now be taken over by Su Nantian.

Originally, they hadn't feared Su Nantian much. Although he had taken 100% of Ti Hao Group's shares, it was a group, not an autocratic empire. As long as they held real power, they weren't afraid of Su Nantian.

But now, starting with Li Hounian, they seemed to be weakening. Like a wall, once one corner was dug out, the whole wall began to look precarious.

They were afraid, feeling that Li Hounian might be their future selves. Each of them was extremely wary of Su Nantian.

Moreover, now Su Nantian was the chairman behind the scenes, and all company matters were entrusted to Wen Ran. Whether in terms of real power or shares, Su Nantian had an absolute advantage.

"Good. If that's the case, then be obedient. After the power transfer is complete, I'll give you five million as your severance pay for these years in Ti Hao Group. That's it. Today is over; we have no hope for this bidding conference. Let's clean up and prepare to return tomorrow."

After saying that, Su Nantian stretched his arms. This was a dismissal.

Li Hounian, Zhang Feng, and Wang Ruichang, three old-timers, naturally understood Su Nantian's meaning. They immediately stood up and left the room.

"Lao Li, this time you really messed up. We can't save you either. Don't think about making money anymore; just survive first," Zhang Feng smiled at Li Hounian and patted his shoulder before leaving.

Wang Ruichang also shook his head and said, "Haste is too hasty." After saying that, Wang Ruichang also left.

Only Li Hounian remained alone in his room.

Su Nantian didn't worry about Li Hounian pulling any tricks; he knew Li Hounian wouldn't dare. His evidence was enough to make Li Hounian suffer. Moreover, a normal person wouldn't run away; the more they ran, the worse it would be.

Plus, Li Hounian couldn't escape; although the hotel looked calm on the surface, it was actually full of secret organization members monitoring. They were everywhere unseen.

Even if Li Hounian had a moment of madness to escape, Su Nantian would immediately have the secret organization members bring him back. And when he was caught, it wouldn't be as easy to talk; now Su Nantian would give him money, but then Li Hounian wouldn't just have to hand over Ti Hao Group's business resources and contacts, but also bear the consequences of his actions.

After the three men left, Wen Ran asked Su Nantian: "What did you mean earlier? Did Zhang Feng have problems?"

Wen Ran had clearly received Su Nantian's glance, but she didn't know what it meant. Hence her question.

After stretching his arms, Su Nantian smiled and said: "Zhang Feng probably has his own plans. In fact, these high-ranking officials definitely have their own plans. Some just want money and don't want to leave Ti Hao Group or harm its interests; they're just greedy. But people like Zhang Feng and Li Hounian want to start their own business."

"How did you figure it out? Li Hounian was clearly exposed, but Zhang Feng didn't show any signs of being wrong from the beginning. Tell me!" Wen Ran smiled and snuggled into Su Nantian's arms, playing with him.

"Enough, enough. I'll tell you. Actually, I didn't notice Zhang Feng at first. Plus, he and Wang Ruichang weren't tempted by Qi Yinzhen and his brother Qi Ye. So I initially thought they were clear. But after exposing Li Hounian, their behavior was different. Recall what they did during the scene and when we spoke with Li Hounian."

Su Nantian didn't directly give the answer but guided Wen Ran, as Ti Hao Group would be fully entrusted to her. Su Nantian knew he wouldn't stay in Hangcheng long; this time, he had taken the opportunity to handle his private business while the Dragon Group was idle. Who knew when they would call him back?

Therefore, before that, he had trained Wen Ran to analyze independently. In this way, she would handle other unexpected situations more effectively. Of course, Su Nantian wouldn't let Wen Ran do everything alone; he had also found her a helper—Qi Yinzhen.

Su Nantian had long noticed that Qi Yinzhen had strong leadership within the secret organization. Otherwise, his combat skills were below Qi Ye but still led the entire secret organization with everyone's trust. This proved Qi Yinzhen's leadership was first-rate, though he hadn't experienced a big company. So with some training and cultivation, Qi Yinzhen would quickly be able to take charge independently.

Moreover, this time Li Hounian was to hand over his business contacts and resources to Su Nantian's people. Su Nantian wanted Qi Yinzhen to take over, but since Li Hounian had already seen Qi Yinzhen's appearance, it would require some effort to make Qi Yinzhen change his identity. When Li Hounian completely left Ti Hao Group, it would be Qi Yinzhen's time to restore his true identity. This wouldn't take long.

"Do you know what was strange about Zhang Feng?" Wen Ran, following Su Nantian's hints, carefully recalled the scene and suddenly realized something.

Chapter 425: Malicious Intent

After a while of thinking, Wen Ran seemed to remember something. She replayed everything she had seen and suddenly realized that Zhang Feng's behavior in Li Hounian's case was overly quiet, completely different from his usual demeanor.

Precisely, Zhang Feng had been in the same state as Wang Ruichang during the bidding conference—ganging up on Li Hounian, eager for him to fail. But once they gathered in this room, Zhang Feng's attitude began to change. He became cautious and careful, spoke little, and only echoed Wang Ruichang's words.

"Ah! I see now. Zhang Feng was too quiet, as if he was thinking of his own safety!" Wen Ran said excitedly and looked up at Su Nantian's face, as if waiting for his praise.

Su Nantian smiled and raised a corner of his mouth, then said to Wen Ran: "Exactly. At the bidding conference, Zhang Feng hadn't thought much yet. Since he and Li Hounian were both high-ranking officials of Ti Hao Group with some conflicts, they would naturally go to any lengths to confirm Li Hounian's guilt."

As he said this, Su Nantian rubbed Wen Ran's hair and continued: "But after Qi Yinzhen actually produced the USB drive and it was discovered that it contained bidding information and proposal documents, Zhang Feng became depressed. He didn't speak at all and was careful and cautious. Even when he spoke, it was only echoing Wang Ruichang's words. That's because he feared that one day he would become like this. Tell me, why was he afraid?"

Su Nantian continued to guide her, like patiently teaching his child. At this moment, Wen Ran was like a child in his eyes. In the business war environment, she was truly an infant and had to absorb water like a sponge quickly.

"Because Zhang Feng also has some hidden thoughts that can't be exposed, and more importantly, his goal is the same as Li Hounian's. He was also thinking of taking advantage of Ti Hao Group's so-called instability to break away from the group and establish his own base. But Li Hounian's incident scared him. Plus, your taking over part of Ti Hao Group's power made him even more anxious. Did I get it right?"

After hearing Wen Ran's analysis, Su Nantian raised his thumb.

"Exactly. That's why Zhang Feng also has ulterior motives. After experiencing this incident, he will hide his thoughts deeper. But even so, it doesn't mean he'll abandon this idea. On the contrary, he will start his plan at a more suitable time, bringing a more fatal blow to Ti Hao Group. Therefore, Zhang Feng must also be eliminated. Even though I didn't go all out on Li Hounian, I might have to cut off Zhang Feng's escape routes."

After saying this, Su Nantian sighed. He had to finish this matter before leaving Hangcheng; he would see how to layout next.

"This matter shouldn't be forced. If Zhang Feng gives up, we'll observe a little more. But we must always watch his movements. If he really does these things, we can't be merciful." Saying this, Wen Ran narrowed her eyes and showed a seriousness she had never shown before.

Su Nantian was captivated by Wen Ran's appearance. This was the first time he had seen her like this, so he immediately picked up Wen Ran, who was nestled in his arms, and walked toward the bedroom.

"You naughty guy, what are you doing!" Wen Ran asked mockingly and lightly punched Su Nantian's chest with her fists.

"Hey, what do you think I'm doing? You'll find out soon!"

The next morning, Su Nantian woke up. His phone showed a message from Qi Ye, not something important but reporting the situation last night. Li Hounian apparently hadn't rested in his room all night and had tried to open the door to escape several times but eventually sighed and returned to his room.

It seemed Li Hounian understood Su Nantian's methods. Although he and Leng Boxiong had no direct connection, they all knew some of the details.

Many people had already sent someone to investigate Su Nantian's background after he took over Ti Hao Group. The investigation results shocked them.

Although their network could only investigate Su Nantian's activities after he arrived in Hangcheng, each event on his resume was enough to make people tremble. Since Su Nantian arrived in Hangcheng, he had successively taken down or conquered several forces. This showed how strong he truly was.

Therefore, Li Hounian had been hesitant and conflicted last night. On one hand, he wanted to escape immediately; on the other hand, he felt Su Nantian's power was impossible to flee. After hesitating for a long time, he finally returned to his room. After all, Su Nantian had spoken kindly—Li Hounian would be forgiven if he handed over the business resources. Although he would leave Ti Hao Group, at least he would have five million and his previous earnings were enough for a comfortable life.

It was also because Li Hounian was old; his inner desire was for stability. If he were ten years younger, he might have taken a risk, but now he just wanted to live peacefully.

But it must be said that his choice was correct, because if he tried to escape, the secret organization would swarm over him. And then Su Nantian wouldn't be as kind as today; he would make Li Hounian suffer.
