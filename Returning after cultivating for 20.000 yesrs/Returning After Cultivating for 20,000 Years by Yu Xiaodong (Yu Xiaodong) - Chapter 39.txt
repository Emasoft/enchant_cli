The scarred man paid no heed to the onlookers' stares, instead he was exhilarated, as if declaring his dominion, revealing his terrifying scar.

He barked at Zhu Ying, "Hurry up and follow me, or I'll kill you!"

Zhu Ying had already started crying from fear, and when the scarred man threatened her further, she trembled and wept, pleading, "Big brother, we're just strangers, don't be like this!"

More people gathered around, but they dared not intervene due to the scarred man's intimidation. In bars, people tend to congregate by their kind, and many eyed Zhu Ying lustfully, imagining they would share in the spoils after the scarred man took her.

Sensing this, Su Nantian furrowed his brows.

Zhang Xiaojun also noticed and took note of the unfolding events.

Yet he did not step forward, for the man was the scarred one.

When Su Nantian rose to approach, Zhang Xiaojun blocked him.

Su Nantian glanced at him questioningly.

"What's wrong?"

"That man isn't a good person; it's better not to go near him," Zhang Xiaojun advised.

Su Nantian merely smiled and did not answer.

Zhang Xiaojun sighed, resigning himself to follow Su Nantian's steps.

Su Nantian pushed through the crowd, finally seeing Zhu Ying weeping like a willow in spring rain. He was momentarily stunned.

Then he saw the scarred man raising his hand to strike Zhu Ying, and Su Nantian's face darkened instantly.

He grabbed the scarred man's thick arm with a single hand.

Chapter 182: Does an apology matter?

The scarred man felt a blur of motion before his arm was clamped by immense force.

The scarred man's eyes widened as he roared at Su Nantian, "Get out of my way, or I'll beat you too!"

A surge of anger rose within him—how dare someone interfere with his business? This was unprecedented.

But when he recognized Su Nantian's face, his fury deepened. A nobody from nowhere dared to show off and play hero?

Though he was surprised by the man's strength, it was only a surprise. He hadn't even used his full power yet.

He was a man capable of pushing a truck alone, and now an ant dared to provoke him? That was suicide.

Su Nantian ignored the scarred man's words, casting a cold glance and saying, "How dare you strike a woman? This is despicable behavior. Your strength is wasted."

Hearing this voice, Zhu Ying felt as if she had found salvation. She rushed behind Su Nantian.

"Quick, let's leave," she urged.

Zhu Ying glanced at the scarred man and pulled Su Nantian to exit.

The onlookers, seeing someone finally intervene, grew excited and edged closer. They all adopted a "let the trouble escalate" attitude.

Zhang Xiaojun saw this and inwardly groaned. Glancing at the scarred man and then Su Nantian, he was unsure what to do.

One was his sister's savior; the other was a man tied closely to the bar.

After pondering, Zhang Xiaojun decided to support Su Nantian.

"Scary Brother, calm down. This is my brother; let's talk it out. There must be a misunderstanding," he said.

The scarred man glared.

"Who are you? Do I know you? And what the hell is a misunderstanding? You're talking nonsense! Get away, and I'll beat you too. I'm taking that woman tonight."

Zhang Xiaojun's heart sank. How could the scarred man not recognize him? They had praised each other yesterday. Why today he denied knowing him?

It was clear—why should the scarred man remember him?

Zhang Xiaojun awkwardly smiled, about to explain further. But before he could speak, a black leather boot flew toward him.

He froze in place and closed his eyes.

But the anticipated blow never came. He slowly opened his eyes to see the boot held firmly by Su Nantian's other hand.

Zhang Xiaojun stared in awe at Su Nantian—this was the scarred man's foot, powerful enough to hospitalize him for half a month.

He couldn't fathom how Su Nantian had caught it with one hand.

And the scarred man's expression was clearly in pain.

"Let go! Who gave you the right to discipline me?" the scarred man snarled.

The scarred man felt his arm and leg were embedded in cement, unable to move an inch.

After hearing the scarred man's words, Su Nantian's gaze turned even more contemptuous. He cast Zhu Ying a reassuring glance before saying, "Apologize to Zhu Ying, and maybe I'll spare your life."

Zhu Ying, hiding behind Su Nantian, was also startled by the earlier kick.

Seeing things were beyond his control, Zhang Xiaojun shielded Zhu Ying, trying not to add trouble for Su Nantian.

"Kid, don't think your strength makes you a hero. You won't leave here today," the scarred man growled.

Hearing this, the scarred man's anger flared—he had never been spoken to like that. To apologize? He didn't even know what apology was.

"Guys, attack!"

As the scarred man commanded, his two companions rushed toward Su Nantian.

But before they reached him, the scarred man's massive body crashed to the ground.

The scarred man slowly rose, cursing them as useless before signaling one of them with a glance.

He sneered and pulled out a folding knife from his back.

With practiced ease, he pressed the button, and the blade shot out like a sword, flashing a cold glint.

Zhang Xiaojun and Zhu Ying both gasped in alarm, shouting in unison, "Be careful! He has a knife!"

Su Nantian's lips curled slightly. A knife had never intimidated him; even if he stood there to be stabbed, it wouldn't work.

"Hmph, meddling again. Today I'll teach your father a lesson for you—don't meddle!" the scarred man sneered, then lunged at Su Nantian with his sharp knife.

Su Nantian remained calm, watching the scarred man approach.

The crowd gasped in alarm. The scarred man was also stunned, but soon revealed his white teeth.

This kid had been scared into silence; the scarred man was elated in his mind.

His steps quickened, eager to see Su Nantian lying in a pool of blood.

Just as the knife tip was an inch from Su Nantian's body, he moved.

When had his two fingers already clamped the sharp blade?

The scarred man's body, like hitting a wall, could not move an inch.

He tried to pull the knife out but found it locked in place by Su Nantian, unable to budge.

Su Nantian lifted his eyes and said, "Using such a small thing to die—do you think so highly of yourself?"

With that, Su Nantian pressed the blade with his two fingers and twisted it, bending the knife.

The crowd gasped again—what kind of strength could bend a blade with two fingers?

The scarred man was also startled but remained composed.

"I see how much you have," he said, thinking Su Nantian had just been lucky and strong.

His other hand was already behind him.

But Su Nantian gave no chance for a second attempt. He squeezed the scarred man's arm with force, and there was a "crack" sound. The scarred man let out a piercing scream.

The intense pain made his body convulse uncontrollably, trembling.

The onlookers watched and felt a shiver. That arm was surely broken!

The scarred man finally realized he had met a tough opponent, one not to be taken lightly.

"Apologize—I apologize, okay?"

The scarred man took several deep breaths and kept saying.

"Apologize! Don't you think it's too late now?" Su Nantian sneered.

The scarred man's hair stood on end, feeling fear for the first time from Su Nantian's icy gaze. A deep-seated fear arose within him.

Chapter 183: He Lin

It felt as if he were being stared at by a fierce beast—no, even more terrifying than facing a real beast.

The scarred man's knees buckled, and he fell to the ground, no longer having his former attitude. His voice trembled as he apologized.

"Miss... I'm truly sorry..."

His legs shook, no trace of his former swagger.

The gathered crowd laughed at the scarred man's state. They hadn't expected this man, usually so intimidating, to be in such a situation—so scared he was about to wet himself.

"Look at him, I thought this scarred man had some skills, but he's already on his knees."

"Indeed, he'll probably wet himself soon."

"Backstabber, didn't you see how skilled that man was?"

Su Nantian coldly observed the cowering scarred man, preparing to deliver a fatal kick. But he felt someone pulling his sleeve from behind.

"Let it go; let's leave," Zhu Ying said, watching Su Nantian. After all, Su Nantian was a student in their class; if trouble arose here, it would be bad.

"Did you suffer? Then do you want to let him go?" Su Nantian asked Zhu Ying.

Zhu Ying looked at the scarred man with fear, and he immediately pleaded, "Auntie, Auntie, I was ungrateful before. Please don't take it personally!"

Zhu Ying turned her head away, whispering, "I never want to see this man again..."

Su Nantian turned back, looking at the scarred man kneeling on the ground. "Did you hear that?"

The scarred man nodded furiously, "I heard it! I understand everything! I'll never appear before this lady again!"

Su Nantian then grabbed his belt, applying slight force to throw the scarred man out of the bar. A loud collision echoed.

The scarred man, after being thrown, hit something and collapsed unconscious, no longer making a sound.

After two seconds of silence, the crowd erupted in cheers. Even the DJ who had stopped playing resumed a song to praise Su Nantian.

The bar's atmosphere instantly surged. Many women rushed forward to catch a glimpse of Su Nantian, but due to the dim lighting and flickering lights, they could only see a blurry face. However, those women who often frequented bars already guessed Su Nantian's full appearance from this blurry image.

At that moment, the women started to flirtatiously gaze at Su Nantian, sending him seductive looks.

Su Nantian was tired of this smoky environment and wanted to quickly take Zhang Xiaojun to "resign" and go home.

But before he could walk a few steps, a stool flew toward him. Before anyone reacted, Su Nantian kicked it back to its original path.

Zhang Xiaojun eyed the direction where the stool came from, holding Zhu Ying back from moving forward.

Su Nantian narrowed his eyes, coldly watching the direction of the stool.

The crowd quickly dispersed, looking at each other nervously.

After a moment, a clear path emerged, and the crowd fell silent with no one speaking.

Then, from that path walked a man even stronger than the scarred man. This man was different from the scarred one—his wide eyes held a sly glint.

Zhu Ying also became anxious; why did one trouble end and another begin!

Among the three, only Zhang Xiaojun showed a look of shock. Zhang Xiaojun was experienced in this bar and knew who the man was.

This muscular giant wasn't anyone else but He Lin, known as "Kun Ge" in the underworld.

Zhang Xiaojun immediately let go of Zhu Ying and rushed to Su Nantian, whispering, "Big Brother Tian, this man is He Lin. He's the strongest in the bar. It's said he once killed someone and had a five-win record in underground boxing."

Su Nantian raised an eyebrow, "That's it?"

Zhang Xiaojun had no words to counter.

From Su Nantian's previous actions, he must have trained, but even so, he couldn't match this ruthless killer.

Su Nantian waved his hand.

Zhang Xiaojun, seeing this, said nothing more and silently prayed Su Nantian had a countermeasure.

He no longer hindered, helping Zhu Ying sit on the booth.

He couldn't help now; just not to cause trouble was enough.

He Lin surveyed Su Nantian from head to toe, sneering and snorting, "You little yellow-haired kid, no muscles, no skills—just brute strength. How dare you mess in my territory? Do you not respect Kun Ge!"

Zhang Xiaojun saw He Lin's furious roar and thought it was bad. He feared He Lin had truly been angered.

His concern for Su Nantian increased.

Su Nantian coldly glanced at He Lin and said, "When you forced a woman to be your concubine, why didn't you help? Now what right do you have to talk about this?"

Though Su Nantian's words were light, each word struck He Lin like a slap.

"Ah, my people's actions don't need to explain to you, do they?" He Lin sneered and glared at Zhang Xiaojun. "Zhang Xiaojun, don't forget who you're on."

Zhang Xiaojun instinctively shrank back.

At that moment, the scarred man who had been thrown out returned trembling. Seeing He Lin, he ran over immediately.

"Big Brother Kun, this kid beat me. I was about to find a woman for you, but this kid came to cause trouble. He doesn't respect you at all."

He Lin glanced at the scarred man and said, "Waste. Go away."

Slowly removing his shirt, He Lin revealed his muscular and fit body.

"Kid, let you feel what real power is!"

He Lin roared and charged at Su Nantian. Zhu Ying thought that a man as big as He Lin would be clumsy, but when he rushed over, she sat in the booth and was shocked.

Zhang Xiaojun was also stunned, his heart rising to his throat.

Big and muscular—okay, but moving like a rabbit, so fast that you couldn't see his form.

Like a speeding train.

Chapter 184: Breaking His Ass

Zhu Ying was frantic, her face showing urgency. She kept looking at Su Nantian.

But Su Nantian remained calm, standing still. To outsiders, He Lin's movements were as fast as a bull, but to Su Nantian, they seemed like a snail moving slowly.

When He Lin thought he had reached Su Nantian and could punch him to the ground, Su Nantian grabbed his neck with one hand and kicked his abdomen.

He Lin's body curled like a shrimp, flying backward and colliding with several tables before falling to the ground. He touched his confused mind, dazed.

The sudden turn of events made everyone gasp in alarm. Some screamed, some closed their eyes, and others laughed joyfully.

Su Nantian was quickly surrounded by people holding sticks.

The scarred man rushed over to help He Lin up. After calming down, He Lin slowly stood up.

"Go there, do you think I'm like you? A waste."

The scarred man looked in the direction He Lin pointed, which was Su Nantian's direction. He trembled immediately.

"Why are you standing here? Don't you understand?"

He Lin wished to beat the scarred man, this fool who had not told him about his strength. This was clearly setting him up!

This idiot was getting more and more foolish, now even not understanding what 2 vs. 1 meant. Did he have to say it so clearly?

The scarred man looked at He Lin's eyes, and after a while, he finally understood. Quietly moving back into the crowd near Su Nantian.

He Lin then looked at Su Nantian, spat on the ground in anger and said, "This is strange!"

"Everyone stop. I'll deal with this kid myself. I don't believe it."

They immediately cleared a large space but still surrounded Su Nantian tightly.

He Lin shook his head, he really didn't believe this. He blamed the mistake on himself for being careless.

He circled Su Nantian a few times, trying to figure out how he had moved before. His small eyes occasionally glanced at the scarred man.

Honestly, he was uneasy about this guy's ability to help him later. He was too useless.

Su Nantian looked at He Lin like a clown, sneering. His posture was like a king on Mount Tai, exuding authority.

This made some girls' eyes turn into peach blossoms; they longed to give him a big hug. Some even imagined indecent scenes, and others had wet their pants slightly.

Su Nantian touched his nose, and He Lin immediately jumped back several steps like a startled bird.

He Lin occasionally glanced at the scarred man lurking near Su Nantian, preparing for a suitable opportunity. He thought two against one would definitely win.

At that moment, He Lin signaled the scarred man with a glance. The scarred man immediately understood and moved to another position, surrounding Su Nantian from front and back.

Zhang Xiaojun's mouth twitched. This scene was like two hyenas surrounding a snow wolf in the animal world, even their appearances were similar. He Lin and the scarred man's character was just like hyenas.

He Lin circled several times but hesitated to attack, always watching Su Nantian for weaknesses.

But Su Nantian remained still, never even lifting his eyelids to look at them. He felt he could not endure this for long.

After circling a few more steps, He Lin finally seemed to decide and rushed forward with lightning speed.

In the shadows, the scarred man's eyes flashed a cruel glint; he was waiting for the right moment to give Su Nantian the most painful blow.

When He Lin reached Su Nantian, Su Nantian suddenly opened his eyes and shot two chilling glares.

He Lin's movement was abruptly halted by these glares.

In this brief pause, Su Nantian moved—slowly lifting his hand and turning it into a palm, immediately enclosing He Lin's fist in his hand.

He Lin was terrified; he felt his body uncontrollable and could not move an inch, as if wearing boxing gloves.

He could only watch helplessly as he fell to the ground.

Suddenly, he saw Su Nantian smiling, that smile was very eerie; a sense of danger arose in his heart.

Meanwhile, the scarred man took the opportunity and pulled out another folding knife from behind, rushed forward with two steps, and jumped.

Holding the folding knife, he roared and was about to stab Su Nantian in the back.

But Su Nantian had already anticipated it, and He Lin was the best shield. As He Lin was about to fall, Su Nantian turned and threw him in front of the scarred man.

The scarred man's knife, without missing, pierced He Lin's ass.

He Lin let out a pig-like scream, agonizingly loud.

The crowd heard it and felt pity; some even instinctively touched their own bodies.

From the sound of impact, it was clear that the two meaty hills had collided with great force. Especially under Su Nantian's push, it was unimaginable what He Lin experienced at that moment.

This would surely leave a deep shadow in his heart for life.

Su Nantian hadn't expected the situation to develop like this; if he had to blame someone, it was only the scarred man's fool. Why use a knife? It would have been better to use a stick.

Safe, painless, and comfortable, and it wouldn't bleed easily.

Su Nantian looked at He Lin's knife in his ass and his current posture, it was unbearable to watch. This kid really knew how to play, seeking excitement with such methods.

Su Nantian's heart felt a little sympathy.

At this moment, the scarred man wanted to die; seeing the straight knife, he was very regretful.

Why had he taken a knife! He should have pulled out a gun instead.

He raised his hands in the air, unsure what to do.

To pull it out or leave it there?

Seeing the red blood, he instinctively shrank back.

The change was too fast; Zhang Xiaojun's "be careful" hadn't even finished speaking when the situation had changed unexpectedly.

Zhang Xiaojun's face was so excited he couldn't control it.

He had never imagined Su Nantian's strength could be so terrifying, the strongest man in the bar—He Lin—had no chance to fight back against Su Nantian. This made him more determined to follow Su Nantian in the future.

Chapter 185: Re-encounter with Wang Chengli

Zhu Ying was also shocked, her mouth wide open.

Looking at the bright knife, she felt a chill.

Su Nantian had only a little sympathy, but it quickly vanished.

Such people deserved to be broken ten times over.

Su Nantian coldly looked at the scarred man, "Pull out the knife, remember to do it slowly, very slowly. Otherwise..."

Su Nantian stretched out the tail of his voice.

He Lin heard this and almost fainted; just thinking about it made him shiver, even short of breath.

A feeling of suffocation arose unexpectedly.

"Big brother, big brother, please don't..."

He Lin begged and apologized, even kneeling. Even if there was a pile of excrement, he would eat it.

The scarred man also looked terrified; hearing Su Nantian's determined tone, this sentence was like a knife against him. If he made a mistake, that knife might be stabbed into his body.

His hands trembled like the knife.

He Lin became even more terrified, "Scarred Man, are you trying to die? Stop! From now on, my position is yours."

The scarred man hesitated, his hand hovering in midair.

At this moment, Su Nantian's voice like a death god echoed again.

"Three seconds; if you don't move, I'll do it myself. Then... hehehe..."

Hearing the cold words and the sinister smile, the scarred man was terrified. He didn't doubt this kid would stab him with that knife. Then it would be too late to change his mind.

Same fear was felt by He Lin on the ground, trembling and unable to move.

Thinking of this, his hand grabbed the knife handle immediately.

Ah!

With He Lin's scream.

The knife was being slowly pulled out.

He Lin's body convulsed, unable to move an inch; he could clearly feel the knife slowly withdrawing.

Until the knife was completely pulled out, He Lin felt something had been lost from his body.

The scarred man trembled as he threw the knife to the ground, but Su Nantian stopped him.

"Now, go back in!"

The light voice like a death sentence entered the scarred man and He Lin's ears.

Su Nantian smiled.

But this smile made the scarred man and He Lin feel deep fear.

Those who dared to provoke him should have prepared for punishment. Although he usually disliked this, today he found something interesting.

Using a knife! It was quite playful, far beyond his imagination.

He felt that small fish and snakes were weak.

Using a knife was so dramatic, with strong visual impact and the sound of piercing ears.

He had never seen it before, so today he was interested.

Su Nantian saw the scarred man didn't move.

His face gradually darkened.

At this moment, a voice echoed from upstairs: "Who dares to mess in my brother's territory! Breaking so many things, don't you have to pay for it!"

Seeing the person upstairs, both He Lin and the scarred man felt a sense of relief.

He Lin immediately collapsed on the ground.

It seemed he had found hope for life.

Zhang Xiaojun frowned after seeing the person's face but, having already seen Su Nantian's strength, he didn't dare to say anything more about being careful.

"Hey you! Who are you? Daring to come here and cause trouble? Lift your head!" the person shouted at Su Nantian.

Su Nantian recognized this voice; the world was indeed small, "Do you need me to remind you who I am?"

The person saw Su Nantian's face and felt like seeing a ghost, immediately losing his balance. The words he had just shouted were cut off in his mouth.

He quickly walked down from upstairs.

Seeing him descend, the scarred man rushed forward and said, "Big Brother Li, you must help us!"

Wang Chengli didn't know how to back down. Seeing the scarred man spoke first, he looked at He Lin on the ground and said, "What's the point of helping? You don't even know who this person is!"

After saying that, Wang Chengli didn't pay attention to the scarred man and hurriedly walked over to Su Nantian, saying humbly, "Big Brother Tian, I was blind, my eyes were full of sand; I didn't see you. Don't be angry, don't be angry."

Su Nantian glanced at Wang Chengli and said, "Speak up. What do you want to compensate?"

Wang Chengli immediately smiled and slapped himself, "You see, your words are so harsh. This thing isn't even worth your attention; what's there to compensate?"

Su Nantian paused, suppressing his irritation before saying to Wang Chengli, "How did you end up here?"

Wang Chengli chuckled and quickly explained to Su Nantian, "This is my brother's territory. I often come here to check."

Su Nantian raised an eyebrow, "Is your territory not enough for you to watch?"

This made Wang Chengli a bit embarrassed, rubbing his nose awkwardly, "Don't say that. You didn't give me any face last time; I lost my territory."

Su Nantian's lips twitched. This Wang Chengli was really useless.

Wang Chengli sighed for a while and continued, "You know, I came here to find my good brother. This territory is under his control; I came to have him assign me a job."

Although it was Su Nantian's fault that Wang Chengli lost his territory, he didn't care at all. The cycle of fate was good; when Wang Chengli ruled the area, he did many bad things. He should know that one day he would be dealt with.

Zhang Xiaojun stared in awe at the two people who seemed familiar talking, his thoughts overflowing with emotion. This night had given Zhang Xiaojun too much excitement and fear.

Zhang Xiaojun thought inwardly: This is what it means to be a real person who doesn't show off.

At that moment, Zhang Xiaojun's loyalty to Su Nantian grew even warmer.

"Zhang Xiaojun," Su Nantian called out.

But Zhang Xiaojun didn't come for a while.

After a long time, "Ah?" Zhang Xiaojun finally came to his senses and looked at Su Nantian with a bewildered expression.

"What were you thinking? I called you twice," Su Nantian said.

Zhang Xiaojun felt a bit embarrassed and rubbed his head, "I was just thinking about something and got distracted."

"Heh," Wang Chengli smiled at Zhang Xiaojun, jokingly said to Su Nantian, "I think Zhang Xiaojun is thinking about how to be loyal to Big Brother Tian."

Zhang Xiaojun was caught in the truth, his ears instantly turned red. Su Nantian knew Wang Chengli was teasing Zhang Xiaojun, so he coldly glanced at him. Wang Chengli immediately stopped his smile and awkwardly cleared his throat.

Chapter 186: Lead the Way

"Big Brother Tian, what's it about?" Seeing Su Nantian protected him so much, Zhang Xiaojun was moved and rushed forward to ask.

"First, take Zhu Ying upstairs to a room and let her rest," Su Nantian pointed at Zhu Ying and said to Zhang Xiaojun.

For the next two days, Su Nantian remained silent, watching Wang Chengli.

Wang Chengli immediately understood and called someone over.

"You go prepare the best room for my honored guest."

The man nodded repeatedly, glancing fearfully at Su Nantian.

Su Nantian finally nodded in satisfaction.

Zhu Ying was still sitting on the booth, her body trembling uncontrollably. In one day, she had experienced so many ups and downs; Su Nantian had saved her multiple times.

Now, in such a pitiful state, it was Zhu Ying's first time ever.

She had been dragged around by the scarred man, her body covered in dirty footprints and spilled alcohol. Her hair was messy, making her look like a fallen woman.

Even Su Nantian felt pity for her.

Zhang Xiaojun supported Zhu Ying as they followed the guide upstairs.

Wang Chengli eagerly asked, "Big Brother Tian, is there anything else you need?"

The scarred man and He Lin saw Wang Chengli's eagerness toward Su Nantian. Their previous thoughts of seeking revenge against him were instantly shattered, vanishing like bubbles.

They dared not speak a word; even Wang Chengli, who was so submissive and flattering, would be able to crush them with a single finger.

Now the scarred man and He Lin only prayed silently that Su Nantian would never remember their existence.

At that moment, they moved subtly, inching backward as if hiding in the darkness.

Su Nantian naturally noticed their movements but since his purpose here had nothing to do with these two insignificant figures, he let them escape.

"I came today to find the boss of this factory; there's something small I need to resolve," Su Nantian said calmly.

Wang Chengli heard this and broke out in cold sweat: "Big Brother Tian, what's the matter? Did my brother do something to offend you? You've already destroyed my territory; can't you be merciful and not kill him?"

Wang Chengli wept while frowning, fearing Su Nantian would destroy his livelihood again.

Su Nantian despised Wang Chengli's weak attitude and said with no good will, "When did I ever let you give me orders? Giving him a chance to live is my greatest mercy. Don't delay, just lead the way."

Wang Chengli saw Su Nantian's changed expression and dared not speak further. He nodded, bowing low to lead Su Nantian.

This bar had three floors: two on the ground and one underground. The middle floor was for bars, booths, etc., while the underground was a place where drunk men and women went. The top floor was reserved for important people or VIPs.

Under Wang Chengli's guidance, Su Nantian followed him into the elevator to the second floor.

As the elevator doors closed, Wang Chengli couldn't resist his curiosity and asked again: "Big Brother Tian... what's the matter with you looking for my brother?"

Su Nantian glanced at Wang Chengli, thinking he had handled the situation well tonight. He might as well tell him.

So Su Nantian said calmly, "The man I brought today—do you know him?"
