Though the villagers of the small fishing village chose to endure their suffering, they remained cautious and fearful of these bullies.

Wasn't this making the bullies even more arrogant?

After thinking about it, Su Nantian felt that something was definitely amiss.

That's why he asked the elder at this moment, for in his many years of living in the small fishing village, he knew that the elder's understanding of these matters was certainly greater than his own.

When the elder heard this, he sighed slowly again.

"It's quite simple. These bullies' identities are not ordinary; they're all the sons of wealthy families in town, and one is even the only son of the town's mayor."

At this point, the elder displayed a sorrowful expression. Especially when thinking about how the villagers of the small fishing village were already struggling to survive, and these bullies still came to oppress them, he felt even more sorrowful.

The elder continued speaking with Su Nantian, explaining everything clearly.

It was only at this moment that Su Nantian realized these people were indeed not ordinary, for these bullies were all the unruly sons of influential families in town.

Because of this status, the villagers of the small fishing village dared not resist easily and had become accustomed to enduring their suffering.

But the more they retreated, the bolder these bullies became.

Previously, these bullies had merely wasted time by occasionally harassing the villagers, but now they had become even more excessive. They demanded that the villagers pay regular protection fees or else someone would be sent to deal with them.

"Unbelievable!"

When Su Nantian heard this, he immediately clenched his fists in anger. "They really have the audacity to demand protection fees? Do they even deserve such fortune?"

At this point, Su Nantian suddenly turned to the elder. "Uncle Wang, do you also have to pay protection fees?"

Su Nantian suddenly thought of this and looked at Uncle Wang.

These days, the village had been peaceful with no incidents. Was it because of Uncle Wang's timely payment of protection fees?

After connecting these events, Su Nantian felt even more angry.

"Yes, both me and Xiao Wang couldn't help it," Uncle Wang said with a face of shame, as if admitting that they dared not resist these people in front of Su Nantian was very embarrassing.

Uncle Wang quickly continued speaking to Su Nantian: "But what we seek is only a moment of peace. Everyone knows that confronting them would bring no good results."

"So you just keep enduring their oppression?"

Su Nantian furrowed his brows, as if unable to accept this fact. "Avoiding only makes them bolder."

Chapter 765: Temporary Compromise

Was there someone else secretly bullying these innocent villagers in places he couldn't see?

"Su Nantian, don't be so angry. Thanks to you, our income has increased significantly compared to before. Even if we gave them some protection fees, we're living well now and aren't as desperate as before."

After saying this, the elder seemed to have realized what Su Nantian was planning and immediately stopped him, shaking his head and saying: "Su Nantian, don't do anything impulsive. I'm not doubting your abilities, but they're certainly not people to be messed with. Otherwise, why don't the young men in our village resist?"

Uncle Wang continued to persuade Su Nantian: "Everyone just wants a moment of peace. Don't stir up more trouble."

After all, the villagers here had long been accustomed to this lifestyle.

"Xiao Chen's incident was indeed Xiao Chen's recklessness. Otherwise, these bullies wouldn't have attacked so easily."

They just needed to endure a little longer; these bullies would not truly go too far.

Uncle Wang knew that Su Nantian was at an age of fiery passion, so he quickly interrupted him and warned him again.

"Su Nantian, these people's identities are not ordinary. If you confront them, you'll definitely lose."

Uncle Wang continued to persuade Su Nantian: "Besides, you're alone. If these bullies just wave their hands, they can gather a group of henchmen to come after you. That would be trouble!"

At this point, Uncle Wang repeatedly warned Su Nantian not to act on impulse, for it would only bring more trouble.

Seeing Uncle Wang's repeated warnings and reminders, Su Nantian understood his fear of these bullies.

Su Nantian quickly nodded and looked up to comfort Uncle Wang: "Don't worry, Uncle Wang. I was just asking, trying to understand this matter. I won't do anything."

After saying that, Su Nantian spread his hands and made a helpless gesture, telling Uncle Wang: "Look at me. Even if I wanted to do something, I lack the strength. I won't make a foolish mistake."

When he heard Su Nantian say this, Uncle Wang finally felt relieved and took a deep breath.

He comforted Su Nantian again: "I know you want to protect our villagers and make their lives better. But this world is so harsh; not everything goes smoothly. Anyway, we're living peacefully now and have become accustomed to this pattern. It's quite good."

After thinking about it, the elder said these words again, telling Su Nantian not to worry about them anymore.

Moreover, Uncle Wang had a kind of 'Ah Q' spirit, thinking that perhaps this way, the bullies from town would find new targets and no longer take pleasure in tormenting them.

"Uncle Wang, don't worry. I know what I'm doing."

After Uncle Wang's repeated warnings, and since he was old, Su Nantian naturally wouldn't argue with him. So he quickly agreed with Uncle Wang's words.

But Su Nantian had already made his own plan in his heart.

Could he endure silently?

Su Nantian definitely couldn't.

If he hadn't known about this, it would have been one thing, but now that he did know, how could he continue to endure?

Moreover, even though Su Nantian didn't remember his past or identity, he found these bullies' behavior extremely unsatisfactory.

At this point, Su Nantian was even more determined to give them a harsh lesson so they would never dare to bully the villagers of the small fishing village again, and even more so, never appear again.

At this point, Su Nantian began to quietly plan in his mind.

He started thinking about how to find these bullies and completely deal with them without involving the villagers of the small fishing village.

While Su Nantian was pondering how to punish these bullies, the outside world remained unable to maintain peace. Especially after Su Nantian had personally destroyed the Wu family and discovered that Su Nantian was an undercover agent, the Nan Gong family now had many troubles.

Originally, the Wu family and the Nan Gong family were two major families in inland port who fought against each other and kept each other in check. Neither of them would back down.

But now that the Wu family had problems, the Nan Gong family stood alone. The storm in inland port gradually began to rise.

Moreover, Su Nantian's action had unintentionally accelerated the fierce competition among the major families in inland port. At this moment, inland port was turbulent and no one could truly maintain peace.

No family could remain untouched.

"Ah, this is really outrageous! I never thought Su Nantian would be so patient in front of us, making it impossible for us to detect his identity!"

Nan Gong Lin sat on the high seat and said angrily.

After saying these words, he also couldn't help but hit the table, releasing his anger in his chest.

At this moment, Nan Gong Yuyan sat on the left side of her father. When she heard her father say this, she also angrily supported: "Father, I have always known that Su Nantian was no ordinary person. But I never thought he would do this! Even Wu Chuan, the old fox, was caught by him! It's really despicable!"

At this point, Nan Gong Yuyan quickly changed her tone: "But he also helped us a bit, right? Father?"

After all, Wu Chuan had always been their Nan Gong family's enemy and something they had long feared.

"Yes! Father! Sister is right!"

Nan Gong Ping quickly spoke up to support Nan Gong Yuyan's words and continued: "Father, even though Su Nantian tricked us, we haven't suffered any losses. He has also eliminated a strong enemy for us."

When Nan Gong Ping said this, he immediately looked at Nan Gong Lin: "Isn't that right, Father?"

Nan Gong Lin thought for a while but still felt this matter was beneficial to the Nan Gong family. However, he didn't understand why his father still looked so troubled.

"Why do you think it's that simple? If this were truly the case, would I have such a troubled expression?"

At this point, Nan Gong Lin took a deep breath and slightly calmed his emotions before speaking to these two children. He slowly explained.

At this point, Nan Gong Lin also showed a worried expression: "If it were just about dealing with Wu Chuan, I would be happy. But the problem is that Su Nantian previously used our Nan Gong family's identity."

Chapter 766: Fanning the Flames

"Did you think that people outside would take this so simply? Would they believe Su Nantian also used us to rise, and that we were completely unaware of it?"

Without waiting for their answers, Nan Gong Lin continued: "They would only think this was our Nan Gong family's plan."

"What if it is? After all, Wu Chuan has been eliminated by us. Who else in inland port could challenge us?"

Previously, they had only fought against Wu Chuan. Other small families in inland port were just minor tricks and didn't deserve to be taken seriously, so they didn't need to fear them.

Nan Gong Yuyan held this view, which was why she said these words.

It was also for this reason that Nan Gong Yuyan felt confused about her father.

"Yes, Father. Sister is right,"

Nan Gong Ping also looked at Nan Gong Lin with confusion and waited for his answer.

At this point, Nan Gong Lin sighed again: "You're still thinking too simply. Do you really think I'm worried about these small families in inland port? I'm worried about those related to Wu Chuan."

At this point, Nan Gong Lin sighed again.

Thinking about the troubles they would face later, Nan Gong Lin felt a headache. "You know, there are always people stronger than you and skies higher than you. Now that Wu Chuan is gone, we can certainly dominate inland port. But what about outside of inland port?"

Nan Gong Lin analyzed while showing a troubled expression, as if he didn't know what the best solution was.

Nan Gong Lin knew that Nan Gong Yuyan and Nan Gong Ping were young and impetuous, not yet seeing the current situation clearly. They thought that eliminating Wu Chuan meant everything was settled and peace had returned.

They didn't realize that more troubles would come one after another, never stopping.

"Those related to Wu Chuan?"

Nan Gong Yuyan asked Nan Gong Lin's words with confusion, and couldn't help but ask: "Father, what do you mean? Wu Chuan is just a person from the Wu family. Does he have any support?"

At this point, not only Nan Gong Yuyan but also Nan Gong Ping felt uneasy.

Was there something they didn't know behind this?

If that were the case, Nan Gong Lin's guess and worries weren't baseless.

They really had trouble now.

At this point, everyone immediately darkened their faces and remained silent. The atmosphere in the room was also extremely heavy.

"But Father, Su Nantian is already dead, right? Even if Wu Chuan had someone behind him, he should be the one to seek revenge against Su Nantian. It shouldn't have anything to do with us, right?"

Nan Gong Ping thought for a while and then asked his question.

He felt they were overthinking this matter, which had nothing to do with them at all.

Nan Gong Lin shook his head: "You said Su Nantian is already dead. So if they want to vent their anger, they can only go after our Nan Gong family. That's what I'm most worried about."

After saying this, Nan Gong Lin couldn't help but show a worried expression.

If Su Nantian were alive, it would have been better. They could have shifted all the blame onto Su Nantian and kept their Nan Gong family clean.

But the problem was that Su Nantian had died together with Wu Chuan and others, so even if they wanted to shift all the problems onto Su Nantian, it was impossible.

"This bastard! Even in death, he's causing us trouble!"

Nan Gong Yuyan couldn't hold back anymore. She didn't care that her father was still in front of her, and let out a curse: "I had warned him before. I said if he dared to infringe on our Nan Gong family's interests, I would never let him go!"

But Su Nantian had actually done it and left behind trouble for their Nan Gong family.

It was really despicable!

"Little sister, don't be angry anymore. It's no use talking about it now."

Nan Gong Ping sighed and took over Nan Gong Yuyan's words, trying to comfort her: "Su Nantian is dead. Even if you don't let him go, what can you do? Would you dig up his corpse and whip it?"

Nan Gong Ping said this, then sighed again.

His intention was to comfort Nan Gong Yuyan and make her stop being so angry, but he didn't realize that this sentence provided a good method for his father and sister.

"Corpse, right! Brother, you've hit the mark."

Nan Gong Yuyan thought for a moment and then took over Nan Gong Ping's words, saying to him: "You've said it right. We haven't seen Su Nantian's corpse yet, so how can we be sure he's really dead? Maybe he didn't die at all and is still alive!"

At this thought, Nan Gong Yuyan's face showed an angry expression again, and her hands clenched tightly.

Nan Gong Yuyan felt that Su Nantian had caused such a big mess, leaving trouble for them, and then changed his identity to leave.

The more she thought about it, the angrier she became.

At this point, Nan Gong Lin also seemed to have thought of the same thing as Nan Gong Yuyan and showed an approving expression.

"Yes, there's a possibility. But I actually hope he's still alive now."

Nan Gong Lin answered and said this slowly.

"Father! You don't need to hope. As long as we spread this message, it'll be unrelated to us."

At this thought, Nan Gong Yuyan immediately suggested.

Nan Gong Lin looked at Nan Gong Yuyan with the same intention, and they both understood each other's meaning. They also thought this was a good method.

Nan Gong Lin immediately nodded to Nan Gong Yuyan: "Yes, do it as you said."

No matter if Su Nantian was alive or dead, they had to first shift this trouble onto Su Nantian. They couldn't let themselves take the blame for him.

Who in this world is so foolish?

"Yes! Father, you can rest assured!"

After hearing this, Nan Gong Yuyan also understood and immediately nodded, rushing out to spread the message according to their discussion.

The Nan Gong family people were indeed not wrong. Wu Chuan had a huge family behind him, which was his mother's family, the Xu family.

Although they were not in inland port, they were also well-known in their area.

Originally, Wu Chuan's father and mother weren't recognized by the family. So after his mother gave birth to Wu Chuan, she left him at the Wu family and returned to her own family. For many years, they had not contacted Wu Chuan at all.

Chapter 767: The Xu Family

Although they had no contact with Wu Chuan, they had only communicated a few times over the years.

But now that Wu Chuan was dead, this matter had completely changed. It was like giving no face to the Xu family at all. Moreover, the Xu family had already started looking for Su Nantian and wanted to kill him to avenge their grandson.

Xu Family, the council room.

A woman in her fifties or sixties but well-preserved rushed in with high heels. She was old, yet her figure was very good. Wearing high heels of about eight centimeters, she walked quickly but remained steady.

Other than some loose skin on her face, the woman looked almost ageless. She had dyed her long hair a deep red wave, which highlighted her personality—always energetic and impulsive.

The woman was clearly angry. She had a pressing matter, so she directly pushed open the door of the council room and spoke before even entering. Her voice was full of委屈.

"Mother! The Nan Gong family, and this Su Nantian person, are really arrogant! They killed my son!"

The woman spoke angrily. Obviously, she was Wu Chuan's mother who rarely met him.

Even though she didn't have much feelings for Wu Chuan, this was still a person connected by blood. Now that Wu Chuan had been killed, it was like they were stepped on in the chest.

If no countermeasures were taken, wouldn't it mean that they Xu family were also easy to bully?

The woman could say that her face's dignity was more important than the pain of losing a son. She was so upset now because she felt it was unseemly for her face.

In the council room, there were several people. They didn't show any surprise at seeing the woman enter and their faces showed no change, as if they were used to her impulsive behavior.

Only the old person sitting on the high seat was affected. His brows slightly furrowed, and his eyes flashed a brief dissatisfaction. He slowly looked up at the woman with an urgent expression.

"Over these years, have you only aged without gaining any wisdom? Even if there's a big matter, you should preserve the dignity of our Xu family. What are you doing now? Are you acting like a scolding woman at the market?"

The old person slowly spoke, his brows slightly furrowed.

The old person was very old. His hair was completely white, and his skin was extremely loose with deep lines. However, his hair was combed neatly, and his eyes were sharp.

Moreover, his eyes didn't look like those of an old person. They weren't murky or yellow with red bloodshot, but instead clear and sharp. When he looked at people, his gaze was extremely intimidating.

His voice when scolding the woman was also full of energy. It could be seen that his physique was still very healthy.

She was obviously the woman's mother, but she scolded her daughter without any mercy. She didn't care about the woman's age.

"Mother, I..."

The woman was scolded by her mother and her face changed. It seemed she felt embarrassed, but also a little dissatisfied.

But before she could speak out her dissatisfaction, the old person had already raised his hand and interrupted her actions. "You should learn from your brothers."

The old person spoke seriously, and the men who were pointed out by him looked down with their eyes on their noses. They had a calm and serene look, showing no arrogance or pride. It seemed they didn't have any thoughts about being praised.

The old person turned the jade ring on his thumb and deepened his gaze, as if thinking about something.

"I know what you want. You want me to take action against the Nan Gong family, right?"

The old person spoke at this moment.

"Yes! Mother! They killed Wu Chuan! That's not giving us face! If we don't retaliate, how will others look at our Xu family?"

The woman heard the topic had finally come up and immediately became excited, looking at the old person. She wanted to rush over and destroy the Nan Gong family right now.

"Xiangning."

The old person spoke at this moment, calling her daughter's name: "The Nan Gong family has a deep foundation and is an old family that has been passed down for hundreds of years. Moreover, they currently hold a significant position in inland port."

The old person slowly analyzed: "Even if our Xu family can issue orders in City A, others still fear us. But the saying goes that a strong dragon cannot overcome a local snake. You should be quite clear about this."

If they rashly took action against the Nan Gong family, one mistake could make them face a strong enemy. They also had to be cautious of the families in City A who were eyeing them.

These people weren't truly submissive to our Xu family. They were more like wild beasts that could bite back at any time if there was profit.

So this risk was too big. The old person had to think carefully.

"Mother! Are we just going to endure it? How can I bear this anger!"

Xu Xiangning felt anxious when she heard her mother say this: "Mother, if we don't do anything, others will still not respect our Xu family. They'll think we're afraid of the Nan Gong family!"

Xu Xiangning used her hands and feet to try to persuade her mother.

"Enough."

The old person raised his hand again, interrupting Xu Xiangning's words.

She was the head of the Xu family and handled all matters within it, holding absolute power over the Xu family. Moreover, she was strong-willed and had a deep authority. A single glance could scare away those under her control.

So when she interrupted Xu Xiangning, even though Xu Xiangning was still reluctant, she didn't dare to say anything else.

"But you did say one thing right. Doing nothing is not our style."

The old person turned the jade ring on his thumb again and thought for a while before slowly analyzing: "But this step can't be rushed. We need to carefully analyze it and see who Su Nantian really is, and who he belongs to."

Obviously, they had already copied the surveillance of Wu family and knew how Su Nantian fought against all of them, including how he killed them all.

So the old person was very curious about Su Nantian. If Su Nantian were alive and hadn't killed Wu Chuan, she might have even wanted to recruit Su Nantian into their Xu family.

She believed that having such a powerful person would elevate the status of the Xu family in City A.

Chapter 768: New Plots

But unfortunately, Su Nantian was now on the opposite side of their Xu family.

Since they couldn't cooperate, and were enemies, there was only one approach. That was to thoroughly investigate and eliminate them without leaving any祸端.

Moreover, the old person's years of experience told her that someone like Su Nantian who was so powerful wasn't the kind of person that the Nan Gong family could cultivate.

The reason was simple. If the Nan Gong family really had such a powerful person, they wouldn't have needed to go through so many rounds and wouldn't have had to look at Wu Chuan's face.

"Investigate, thoroughly investigate this matter, especially Su Nantian's identity and who he belongs to."

The old person narrowed her eyes and spoke seriously.

"Mother? Do we really need to investigate? Su Nantian is just a bodyguard of the Nan Gong family, right?"

Xu Xiangning looked at the old person with confusion, puzzled by her actions and thought she was overcomplicating things. Why waste manpower investigating a small bodyguard?

When the old person heard Xu Xiangning's words, she didn't even give her a second glance. She bypassed her and instructed the other sons.

Her sons quickly understood what the old person meant, nodded in agreement, and left the council room.

The old person also left with a cane. As she left, she didn't even give Xu Xiangning a second glance.

Xu Xiangning was still confused and could not understand what had happened. She just stared at the old person leaving.

"Hmph! Everyone looks down on me!"

Xu Xiangning angrily swept the cup on the table to the ground. In an instant, there was a sound of glass falling, which was quite annoying.

Xu Xiangning angrily looked at the broken glass on the ground. Her hands tightly clenched, and her red nails looked even more terrifying.

She would find Su Nantian and give him a good lesson, then prove to the Xu family that she was not to be looked down upon!

"Hmph! Everyone looks down on me. They just look down on me!"

Xu Xiangning angrily said, her face showing an expression of intense anger.

She looked at the broken glass and felt her mood was even worse.

Xu Xiangning knew she had always been a person who could be ignored in the Xu family. Everyone looked down on her, and she had done so many foolish things when she was young.

Including this incident with Wu Chuan, which brought great shame to the family. So the family looked down on her even more.

So when she thought about how her mother had treated her and how her brothers completely ignored her, she felt even more angry and was in a bad mood.

Xu Xiangning thought that she would do something big to make everyone in the Xu family change their view of her.

After thinking about this, she felt better and wasn't as angry anymore.

After thinking about these things, Xu Xiangning didn't want to wait any longer. She prepared to carry out her big plan.

She swore she would make everyone in the Xu family change their view of her and never look down on her again.

Xu Xiangning didn't know that everyone in the family actually didn't care about her. Even if she did something big and earth-shattering, the Xu family wouldn't give her a second glance.

Moreover, now that the Xu family was busy gathering information about Su Nantian, they were definitely not going to let go of the Nan Gong family who had provided a platform for Su Nantian.

The Xu family's people were now busier than ever, dealing with more matters. No one was paying attention to Xu Xiangning anymore.

But Xu Xiangning didn't know she had already become a discarded person in the family. She was still fantasizing about doing something big to make everyone in Xu family look at her differently.

With this thought, she carefully dressed herself and soon arrived at the front of a luxurious villa.

She seemed to be a regular guest, so the guards didn't even ask and directly opened the door for her.

After entering, she went straight to the point without wasting time.

"Mrs. Xu, you're here."

As soon as Xu Xiangning entered, she was greeted by a young man who looked like a butler. He quickly came to Xu Xiangning and respectfully greeted her.

Xu Xiangning directly asked him: "Where's Master Hong?"

While asking, she also looked around as if searching for Master Hong. She seemed very anxious.

"Mrs. Xu, please follow me. Master Hong is in the study now."

The butler seemed very familiar with Xu Xiangning and was polite. After telling her, he quickly led her upstairs.

"Thank you."

Xu Xiangning waved her hand to send away the butler. Then she knocked on the door.

After receiving permission from inside, Xu Xiangning quickly entered: "Master Hong~"

Although he was almost sixty years old, Xu Xiangning took good care of herself. Her skin was smooth and her voice was sweet. Although it wasn't the innocence of a girl, it had the charm of a mature woman.

The man called Master Hong seemed to have known Xu Xiangning was coming. When he saw her, he wasn't surprised at all and immediately spoke: "Baby, what's wrong? Why are you so gloomy? Did someone insult you?"

"Master Hong~"

Xu Xiangning called Master Hong again with a scolding tone. Then she walked up to Master Hong and didn't wait for him to stand up before sitting on his lap. She also scolded: "Isn't there someone insulting me? Master Hong, will you help me take care of it?"

While saying this, Xu Xiangning used her finger to draw circles on Master Hong's chest. It seemed she had a good way of charming men.

"Oh?"

Master Hong immediately wrapped his arms around Xu Xiangning's waist. Xu Xiangning took good care of herself, and since she was from the Xu family, she had everything even if she wasn't favored. Moreover, because she took good care of her skin, she didn't look like people of her age. Her skin was tight and white. Even if it wasn't the touch of a girl, it wasn't bad.

That's why Xu Xiangning could flirt without any awkwardness and didn't make people feel disgusted.

That's why Master Hong, who had a high status and could find more young and beautiful girls, was particularly fond of her.

"Who insulted my baby? Tell me quickly. I'll take care of it for you."

Master Hong's tone was indulgent, as if he really loved Xu Xiangning. "Just tell me."

Chapter 769: Mutual Calculations

"Have you heard about the incident in inland port? The Wu family was destroyed by a young man named Su Nantian. The one killed was my son, Wu Chuan."

Xu Xiangning quickly told Master Hong about this matter.

Master Hong was different from the Xu family. They were active in the open as aristocrats, while Master Hong had climbed up from an unknown person to his current position by surviving in the underground world. He was a man who had done business in the underworld.

Moreover, Master Hong had deep scheming and was extremely skilled.

"Su Nantian? Are you trying to get me to help you avenge your son and vent some anger?"

Master Hong, with this identity and having eyes everywhere, naturally knew about Wu Chuan's matter. He had already guessed that Xu Xiangning was coming to see him, but he didn't say it directly. He pretended not to understand and waited for Xu Xiangning to bring it up.

"But this kid, hasn't he already died with your son? I want to help you vent some anger, but where can I go?"

Master Hong continued asking and looked at Xu Xiangning with a meaningful gaze.

"Master Hong, this Su Nantian hasn't died yet! The Xu family has sent many people to search for the body, but there's no sign of it. Also from the surviving servants, we know that this lotus pond is a flowing lake connected to the outside. This Su Nantian must have escaped."

Xu Xiangning quickly continued, and then playfully hit Master Hong's shoulder with her fists: "Master Hong, just say it! Do you want to help me or not?"

After saying this, Xu Xiangning also looked at Master Hong with a pouting expression and a shy, romantic look.

"Anyone who dares to insult my baby will definitely not be spared."

Master Hong quickly answered Xu Xiangning and then said: "But today, if I help you with this matter, what will you use to repay me?"

Master Hong said while his hand covered Xu Xiangning's hand, and he gently rubbed it. His eyes also had implications.

"Ugh! You're still so bad!"

Xu Xiangning playfully scolded, then covered Master Hong's hand with her own and interlocked their fingers: "As long as you promise me, I'm willing to do anything for you."

At this moment, the study was filled with intimacy. The servants outside were even blushing from the intimate sounds.

Afterward, Xu Xiangning adjusted her clothes and left a kiss on Master Hong's face: "Master Hong, I'm waiting for your good news."

"Okay. Don't worry,"

Master Hong smiled again and kissed Xu Xiangning's hand tenderly: "Xia, send off Xiangning."

"Yes! Master Hong."

Xia, the butler, immediately respectfully sent Xu Xiangning out.

As they left, Master Hong's indulgent expression quickly disappeared. The tenderness he had shown towards Xu Xiangning vanished instantly, as if those emotions never existed on Master Hong's face.

"Master Hong."

After Xia sent Xu Xiangning out, he quickly returned to the study. He respectfully looked at Master Hong and asked: "Master Hong, why did you help Mrs. Xu?"

To be honest, Xu Xiangning was well-preserved, but she had already aged. Master Hong didn't need to have such a relationship with her. Why was he playing games with her?

"Ah, of course there's profit involved."

Master Hong sneered and looked at Xia. His gaze clearly implied that Xia was too young and hadn't seen the current situation yet.

"Master Hong?"

Xia looked at Master Hong with confusion, not understanding what he meant by this sentence.

Profit involved?

But Xu Xiangning was known as a discarded person, and she wasn't valued by the Xu family. Even her mother didn't value her, treating her like a useless person. What could she do?

"Ha ha, if you can understand this, I would have given my position to you. Why would it be mine?"
