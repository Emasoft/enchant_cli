He could no longer utter a single sound, leaving only an expression of ultimate terror frozen on his face.

The other security personnel, witnessing Su Nantian's brutal and merciless actions, recoiled in fear. None dared to look at him again.

At that moment, their bullets had run out. Each discarded their weapons and retreated furiously, unwilling to approach Su Nantian.

After all, they had witnessed his ferocity and cruelty firsthand. They had seen him snap Li’s assistant's neck with a single hand.

How could they dare to remain?

"Su Nantian! What do you intend to do?! You killed Li’s assistant in anger—what else do you seek?!"

It was no coincidence that Wu Chuan and Li’s assistant were as one. Their methods of evasion were identical.

At this moment, Wu Chuan feigned composure and barked at Su Nantian with a stern voice, hoping to intimidate him.

But his hope was futile. Su Nantian did not fear him, let alone the fact that Wu Chuan had killed Wu You’er and her parents.

Each of these debts would be repaid in full by Su Nantian.

At this moment, Su Nantian did not even glance at Wu Chuan. His gaze remained fixed on the fleeing security personnel.

Seeing their increasingly exaggerated expressions of terror, Su Nantian felt a smirk rise to his lips.

When they had pointed guns at him and Wu You’er, and when they had dragged out this helpless woman, had they ever considered the consequences?

Now that he could subdue them, they only ran and begged for mercy.

How could there be such an easy victory?

If he spared them, who would spare Wu You’er?

With this thought, Su Nantian kicked up the bullets on the ground. Not a single security guard was spared; each was pierced through the neck, their wounds sealing their fate with no chance of survival.

"You! You..."

Wu Chuan, witnessing Su Nantian’s swift execution of so many guards in a single second, could only stammer: "You—don’t come near me, Su Nantian! I am Wu Chuan! Don’t act recklessly!"

Chapter 755: The Final Battle Hymn

He took a step back almost instinctively, his former arrogance vanishing. He could no longer stand tall before Su Nantian.

"It’s not my fault. Wu You’er provoked me constantly, so I had no choice but to issue the order. Besides, her parents committed suicide; it has nothing to do with me. You are blaming all this on me—it’s unfair!"

Even now, Wu Chuan made no apology. He still saw no fault in himself, shifting all blame onto Wu You’er and her family, begging Su Nantian to spare him.

"They are all dead. Now only you remain."

Su Nantian did not answer Wu Chuan at all, but instead declared his fate.

Then he fixed Wu Chuan with a cold and merciless gaze, watching him retreat in fear.

Su Nantian found it bitterly ironic.

"Did you ever think about how afraid they were when you forced them?"

Su Nantian pressed forward, each step accompanied by a cold and accusing question: "Did you ever consider how unsettled they felt when they had no control over their fate?"

"You—don’t come any closer! Don’t come any closer!"

Wu Chuan, now terrified, pleaded desperately.

He begged Su Nantian not to approach him, abandoning all dignity and composure.

As Wu Chuan took a few steps back, his face was filled with fear. At that moment, his foot accidentally struck something hard.

Yes!

He suddenly remembered an important detail.

This was the secret weapon he had ordered Li’s assistant to bring out—something with the power of a rocket launcher.

At this thought, Wu Chuan’s eyes flashed with hope. This was his last chance to turn the tide. Whether Su Nantian’s luck held or whether this weapon would prevail was now uncertain.

Su Nantian could withstand bullets, but this secret weapon was infinitely more powerful—far beyond the level of mere bullets.

Wu Chuan refused to believe Su Nantian could overcome this weapon.

So, at that moment, Wu Chuan decided to gamble. He leapt back and seized the weapon, immediately aiming it at Su Nantian.

"You don’t come any closer!"

Wu Chuan continued to warn Su Nantian, trying to intimidate him.

"It’s useless."

Su Nantian coldly replied, his steps unrelenting as he pressed forward.

But when the secret weapon fired, Su Nantian found himself unable to fully block its power. He was pushed back several steps, and the palm he used to shield himself was torn open, oozing blood.

Wu Chuan, seeing the weapon had an effect on Su Nantian, widened his eyes in sudden hope.

"Su Nantian! Farewell!"

Wu Chuan gripped the weapon tightly, determined to kill Su Nantian and end this threat forever.

At that moment, Wu Chuan continued firing at Su Nantian.

But Su Nantian had already learned the weapon’s power and would not stand idly by.

So he skillfully dodged, confident he could overcome Wu Chuan and avenge Wu You’er.

Wu Chuan, now desperate to survive, found his spirit rekindled. The heavy weapon was difficult to carry, but his will to live gave him the strength to lift it.

Wu Chuan’s face twisted into a wild expression as he fired repeatedly at Su Nantian.

At this point, Wu Chuan no longer sought merely to kill Su Nantian—he wished for mutual destruction, determined not to let Su Nantian live.

Su Nantian dodged the attacks while pressing forward toward Wu Chuan.

When they were just a step apart, Su Nantian drew the small dagger he had kept as a备用 (backup) weapon since completing his first mission.

This was a gift from the headquarters upon finishing his initial task.

He had carried it all this time as a memento, never expecting to use it now.

At that moment, Su Nantian resolved himself and lunged forward, his chest directly facing the weapon’s barrel.

At the same time, he plunged the dagger into Wu Chuan’s heart.

"You!"

Wu Chuan could only utter that single word before collapsing, his eyes wide with disbelief and despair.

Clearly, Wu Chuan had believed he could kill Su Nantian.

Yet in the end, he was easily dispatched by him.

"Finally dead..."

Su Nantian dropped the dagger, his breath heavy as he closed his eyes. "Wu You’er, did you see? I have killed your enemy."

Su Nantian whispered lowly. His chest was wounded from blocking the weapon’s fire, and even breathing caused sharp pain.

His steps were unsteady, but despite risking half his life to kill Wu Chuan, Su Nantian felt an immense sense of satisfaction.

At last, he had avenged Wu You’er.

"You die! You die!"

But as Su Nantian believed his revenge was complete and all was well, he neglected the security chief lying at his feet.

The security chief had been shot but still clung to life.

At this moment, he mustered the strength to suddenly lunge at Su Nantian.

Su Nantian, already wounded and barely standing, was knocked off balance by the impact and fell into the carp pond behind him.

"Plump!"

Su Nantian plunged into the water, sending up a cascade of splashes.

Su Nantian had never expected that even the security chief, on his last legs, could still strike back.

But it was too late to regret—he had fallen into the lake in a humiliating manner.

Cold water rushed in from all sides, flooding his nostrils and throat.

Damn it—how could the Dragon Group’s top expert meet such a humiliating end?

Su Nantian bitterly smiled in his mind.

But thinking of having avenged Wu You’er before dying, it was worth it.

As the water grew deeper, Su Nantian’s consciousness faded. Yet he felt at peace knowing Wu You’er's hatred had been resolved.

His eyes slowly closed, and soon his consciousness vanished.

Su Nantian finally thought: Had I died?

Chapter 756: A New Beginning

"Plump!"

Su Nantian felt something heavy strike his mind. Under the force of this impact, his eyes无力 closed.

Before closing them, Su Nantian remembered one final impression: a massive whirlpool that swept him in.

He felt himself torn apart by a powerful current, his limbs and head subjected to relentless force.

Su Nantian’s final thought was: Perhaps even death is this painful.

Soon, all his consciousness vanished; no impressions remained. Finally, he fell completely into darkness.

Here were two green hills with a rushing river between them. A small wooden raft floated slowly in the center of the river.

On it were two bamboo chairs, a large fish basket woven from vines, and an old man and a boy standing.

The elder wore blue long robes with white hair, while the boy wore an extremely festive red overalls. He was about six or seven years old, with a small tuft of hair on his forehead and a tiny tail-like braid at the back, barely an inch long but giving him a cute, rugged appearance.

"Hey! Grandpa! Look! Isn’t there someone floating over there?!"

The boy was surprised and excited, jumping up and down on the raft while constantly pointing ahead.

The elder, hearing this childish speech, ignored it and said with a calming tone: "It's the middle of the river. How could there be anyone? It must be a school of fish!"

But as soon as the elder spoke, he followed the boy's finger and saw an object floating on the water. Judging by its shape, it truly looked like a person.

"Ah! There really is someone! Quick, Xiao Wang, go over there!"

Regardless of whether it was a person or not, they had to check personally. Otherwise, this could be a life lost.

The elder instructed his grandson and quickly paddled the bamboo toward the figure.

"Hey! Grandpa!"

Xiao Wang was very obedient, helping his grandfather approach the spot.

The two worked together to move the raft closer.

"Xiao Wang, stay here and don’t move. I’ll check."

The elder instructed his grandson before confirming the person floating on the water was still alive. Then he immediately carried him onto their raft.

This person, who had been rescued, was Su Nantian.

It turned out that the lotus pond at Wu’s house connected to a larger river, and water was changed monthly. Su Nantian had no idea whether it was luck or fate that he was swept into the river on this day.

So Su Nantian was carried by the water currents and eventually drifted into this connected river.

He floated endlessly, and it was sheer luck that this pair of grandfather and grandson found him.

If they had arrived even a little later, Su Nantian would have already been a corpse.

After rescuing him, they didn’t waste time but immediately took Su Nantian back to their home.

"Grandpa, why won’t this big brother wake up? Is he playing dead?"

Xiao Wang stood by the bed, curiously observing Su Nantian. At this moment, Su Nantian had his eyes closed and no signs of waking up.

Xiao Wang was very curious about this strange big brother, having waited by the bed since he was brought back. He didn’t go anywhere.

"Xiao Wang, don’t just stand here. Go play outside. He’ll wake up soon."

The elder affectionately looked at his grandson, patted his head, and said.

The elder had brought Su Nantian back, changed him into clean clothes, and gave him two bowls of ginger tea to drive out the cold. However, for Su Nantian’s head wound, he could do nothing but bandage it.

As for the rest, they had to leave it to fate. After all, this small fishing village was remote and backward; there were no doctors. When villagers got sick or injured, they would go out to gather herbs.

Whether it healed depended on fate.

Thinking of this, the elder sighed again but still hoped Su Nantian would wake up.

The elder led Xiao Wang out, but Xiao Wang didn’t stay quiet for long and soon sneaked back into the room. He stood by the bed again, curiously observing Su Nantian lying there.

"Cough! Cough!"

At this moment, Su Nantian suddenly coughed.

Xiao Wang immediately became excited: "Big brother! You finally woke up!"

Su Nantian opened his eyes and saw this scene: a boy with a rugged face jumping around him, clearly happy to see him awake. Then the boy immediately excitedly spoke, his voice soft and cute.

"Big brother! Wait for me—I’m going to get Grandpa!"

Xiao Wang was lively and immediately ran out, giving Su Nantian no chance to speak.

Where was this?

Su Nantian furrowed his brows, filled with confusion. He opened his eyes to examine the scene and found it was just a very simple rural house. The walls were worn, with obvious cracks on the surface.

The room was extremely simple, with only four walls and a red table in front of the bed. The table had one leg missing, supported by bricks underneath.

"Ugh!"

Su Nantian turned to examine another spot, but the movement pulled at his head wound, causing an involuntary cry of pain.

"Grandpa! I didn’t lie to you! This big brother really woke up!"

The boy’s voice came from outside the door. Soon, an elder entered with the child.

Su Nantian knew the boy but found this elder very unfamiliar.

"You woke up, young man?"

The elder saw Su Nantian’s eyes open and sighed in relief.

Then the elder didn’t wait for Su Nantian to answer but continued: "Ah, young man, you were lucky. This area is usually uninhabited. My little grandson was just begging to go out today, and it turned out we found you."

The elder said this while sighing. Perhaps this was Su Nantian’s fate with their family.

"Did you save me?"

Su Nantian was surprised and looked at these two strangers, asking. His mind was full of confusion.

Chapter 757: Losing Memory

After they confirmed, he continued to ask: "Then, may I inquire where this is? And what are your names, elders?"

Su Nantian was still full of confusion and asked clearly.

"Oh! I forgot to explain to you!"

The elder said, patting his head: "This is Xiao Wang, my grandson. This place is a small fishing village where we’ve lived for generations, making our living by fishing."

After introducing his identity and location, the elder immediately asked Su Nantian: "How did you end up here? Why did you fall into this river and hit your head?"

The elder introduced his identity and location, then immediately asked Su Nantian. He was very curious about this person who had appeared here.

"Thankfully, we found you in time; otherwise, you would have been in danger when the tide came."

The elder added with a sigh.

Su Nantian shook his head: "Sorry, I don’t remember."

He was also confused about his identity and the reason for being here. But Su Nantian felt a blank mind, dazed and confused, unable to recall anything.

"Don’t remember?"

The elder looked at Su Nantian in surprise, then said: "Ah, it’s understandable. You hit your head so severely; maybe you bumped into something when you fell."

The elder gave Su Nantian an answer, then continued: "But are you really remembering nothing? Not even your name or identity, and what happened?"

"Yes, I don’t remember. But I do remember my name—Su Nantian. Other things, I can't recall."

At this moment, Su Nantian suddenly remembered his name but had no memory of anything else.

And at this moment, something strange occurred: Su Nantian felt he was trying hard to remember but couldn’t recall anything, as if his memories were locked away.

At this thought, Su Nantian felt confused but couldn’t find an answer.

"Only your name?"

The elder spoke again, thinking for a moment before saying: "It’s fine that you remember your name. Don’t worry, I’ll go out and look for more clues to help you find the answers. You might remember gradually."

The elder kindly offered a solution for Su Nantian and took the responsibility of his situation.

"Thank you, elder."

At this moment, Su Nantian was very grateful to the elder and sincerely thanked him.

As he said this, Su Nantian felt his face was itchy and there was a bump on the back of his ear.

Su Nantian felt confused, so he touched the spot and grabbed it.

"Young man, what’s wrong with you?"

The elder saw Su Nantian's strange expression and his sudden action, looking puzzled.

Su Nantian didn’t answer the elder but felt something strange on the back of his ear. He instinctively pulled it, and a large piece of skin came off.

Su Nantian looked at the complete face skin in his hand, showing an expression of disbelief.

"A human skin mask?"

Su Nantian instinctively whispered, his face full of shock.

"Hey! Grandpa! Look! This big brother is so amazing—he changed faces instantly! But this big brother looks better, more handsome!"

Xiao Wang wasn’t frightened by the scene but was excited. He jumped around and told his grandfather, not knowing the issue but thinking it was amazing.

The elder, having lived so long, even though he had always lived in this small fishing village, knew that Su Nantian’s face having a human skin mask was an unusual event.

Combined with Su Nantian's severe head injury and floating on the river, he began to suspect Su Nantian’s identity. He looked at Su Nantian with caution.

"What are you..."

The elder, cautious, slowly spoke.

At this moment, Su Nantian felt the change in the elder’s emotions and knew his current appearance was indeed strange. So he quickly spoke to the elder: "Sorry, elder, I don’t remember my identity at all."

After saying this, Su Nantian paused and continued: "But these things indicate I am not a simple ordinary person. I know I won’t trouble you, so I’ll leave now."

After saying he would leave, Su Nantian added: "Thank you for saving me. If there’s anything I can do in the future, I won’t refuse."

After all, they had saved his life. Su Nantian didn’t want to involve this innocent pair of grandfather and grandson because of his own situation.

Especially since Su Nantian felt there was something strange about his identity and didn’t understand how he had been injured or ended up in this small fishing village.

At this thought, Su Nantian lifted the blanket and prepared to leave, not wanting to trouble these kind-hearted people who had saved him.

Su Nantian quickly lifted the blanket and prepared to leave, but after doing this action, he felt a strong dizziness.

He barely stood up and wanted to walk two steps forward but lost consciousness again, falling to the ground.

"Grandpa! This big brother fell asleep again!"

Xiao Wang shouted, pointing at Su Nantian.

The elder looked at Su Nantian lying on the ground and sighed helplessly.

Well, it's fate—otherwise, among so many people in our small fishing village, why did we encounter Su Nantian?

At this thought, the elder sighed again.

He said: "Well, it's better to help a person all the way. We've already saved him; we can't just watch this young man die in front of us!"

At this thought, the elder decided to keep him.

As for whether it was a blessing or a curse, or what trouble it might bring, they would have to see.

After thinking this through, the elder let Xiao Wang accompany him and carefully placed Su Nantian back on the bed.

Su Nantian fell into a deep sleep and remained unconscious for three days.

Chapter 758: The Small Fishing Village

"Grandpa, what's wrong with this big brother? Why hasn’t he woken up yet? Isn't he hungry? He's been asleep for three days!"

Every day, the boy had to come around Su Nantian’s room to check if he was awake.

Seeing Su Nantian still lying in bed with his eyes closed, the boy asked his grandfather.

The elder patted the boy’s round head and said: "Xiao Wang, your brother was injured and hasn’t recovered yet. Let’s not disturb his rest, okay?"

But as soon as the elder said this, Su Nantian slowly opened his eyes.

He saw the familiar layout and the two familiar people in front of him, immediately regaining his strength. He again lifted the blanket and said: "Elder, don’t worry; I’ll leave now. I won’t trouble you at all."

After saying this, Su Nantian tried to sit up but hadn’t finished the action when the elder reached out and stopped him: "Forget it, young man. You stay here to rest properly. Since you’ve lost all your memories, it means your fate is over. From now on, stay here and live quietly."

The elder had made a big decision. After thinking for a while, he continued: "But you can’t use this name anymore. Choose another simple one. As for your real identity, I’ll look into it when I go to the city to sell fish."

The elder, having lived so long, knew many things.

He had already decided to keep Su Nantian as a problem but couldn’t let more people in the village know about his existence. So he asked Su Nantian to choose a pseudonym and live quietly in the small fishing village.

As for Su Nantian’s real identity, he would help investigate when he went to the city.

"Elder, are you really willing to let me stay?"

At this moment, Su Nantian felt grateful toward the elder. At present, besides his name, he had no idea about his identity.

With such a vast world, he hadn’t thought of where to go.

So when the elder agreed to let him stay, Su Nantian was truly grateful.

He knew the elder’s request for a new name was to protect him and also protect the villagers. So Su Nantian didn’t hesitate at all and agreed immediately.

"I’ll follow your advice, elder."

Su Nantian looked at the elder sincerely and said: "Thank you for your great kindness. I will remember it, and when I regain my memories, I’ll definitely repay you."

This sentence was entirely from Su Nantian’s heart without any ulterior motives.

The elder shook his head and smiled: "You don’t need to repay me. I just want you to promise me one thing."

"Please speak, elder."

Not only one thing—saving his life, even a hundred things, Su Nantian would agree immediately.

"It’s not the time to say it now."

The elder shook his head slowly: "When the time comes, I’ll tell you. But I hope you can agree then. Rest assured, this thing is within your ability; I won’t trouble you."

"Okay, I agree with you."

Su Nantian didn’t hesitate at all and answered seriously.

Seeing Su Nantian’s immediate nod, the elder looked at him deeply.

Although he had lived his whole life in this small fishing village and hadn’t seen much of the world, he could tell Su Nantian was definitely a great person.

At this thought, the elder felt that perhaps encountering Su Nantian was not a trouble or disaster but an unexpected blessing.

"Good, you stay here and live quietly."

The elder said politely to Su Nantian again, then asked Xiao Wang to bring the porridge they had prepared in. They needed to nourish Su Nantian’s stomach first.

Thus, Su Nantian was naturally allowed to stay.

In these few days, Su Nantian had roughly understood the situation of this small fishing village and also learned the names of the elder and the boy.

The elder was named Wang, and the boy was called Wang Wang. Su Nantian used an excuse that he was the elder’s nephew, named Wang Li, with a very ordinary name.

With this identity, Su Nantian felt more at ease and stayed quietly. He lay in bed to recover his strength, and when he was better, he would go out with Xiao Wang to explore the small fishing village.

This small fishing village was remote and had few people. In total, there were about thirty households, with a population of less than two hundred.

So it was easy to see everything at a glance. The people here were all familiar with each other.

When the villagers saw Su Nantian’s unfamiliar face, they all showed curiosity.

But after hearing Xiao Wang say that Su Nantian was his uncle, they stopped their thoughts and didn’t doubt Su Nantian. Moreover, because of this relationship, the villagers were very friendly to Su Nantian.

Their behavior showed that Grandpa Wang had a good reputation in the small fishing village, so they accepted Su Nantian as a stranger easily.

Su Nantian quickly adapted to life in the small fishing village and got used to this simple rhythm.

The people here worked from sunrise to sunset, either fishing or hunting in the mountains. Their lives were very primitive.

In these few days, Su Nantian also learned that the people here had never left the small fishing village. Only a few would go out to sell fish and bring back some daily necessities.

Su Nantian also learned that the small fishing village was backward, with no foot doctor. When people were sick or injured, they would follow the advice of their elders and go out to gather herbs.

Su Nantian still couldn’t remember his memories, but he was certain that the place where he had lived before was definitely not this backward place. It was very advanced.

However, the small fishing village had one good point: every time Su Nantian went out and breathed this air, he felt his body was light and full of energy. It seemed like every cell in his body was nourished.

At this moment, Su Nantian hadn’t realized that he had been nurtured by the abundant spiritual energy of the small fishing village, and even his head wound and chest injury were healing quickly.

He felt more energetic every day, but Su Nantian didn’t know his body was being nourished by this spiritual energy. He hadn’t realized he was still a cultivator.

Su Nantian had completely adapted to life in the small fishing village but didn’t know that outside there were people desperately searching for him, desperate to find him.

Chapter 759: Searching

Dragon Group, High-Level Meeting.

"Why has Su Nantian cut off contact with the headquarters? Where is he? I need to know his whereabouts immediately!"

The high-ranking official of the Dragon Group angrily slammed a file on the table, making a loud noise. But this couldn’t release his anger.

They had placed all their hopes on Su Nantian, but they never expected such a great talent to have this problem.

After all, Su Nantian had always ranked first in the Dragon Group. Any mission he accepted never had any problems.

This was a rare event, and the high-ranking officials felt even more angry.

They were most worried about Su Nantian’s safety. After all, they had invested a lot of effort and resources to cultivate such an excellent talent.

And for someone as outstanding as Su Nantian, even if they tried to cultivate another person, it would be impossible to reach this level.

That was why the high-ranking officials were so angry.

They wanted to mobilize all Dragon Group members to search for Su Nantian immediately.

They would not allow any mistake with Su Nantian.

But unfortunately, the Dragon Group had many responsibilities and a lot of problems to handle; they couldn’t focus all their energy on searching for Su Nantian.

At this thought, the high-ranking official’s expression became even worse.

"Why did this happen? The previous reports said everything was going smoothly, and Su Nantian had already approached the target and reached an agreement. How could such a serious problem occur?"

They were angry and shocked when they received the news yesterday.

The destruction of the Wu family was within their expectations, but it wasn’t a big problem. The real issue was that Su Nantian had disappeared without a trace.

At this thought, the high-ranking official’s anger was uncontrollable.

"Who can give me an answer?"

The high-ranking official immediately asked the others, but they all lowered their heads without saying a word. No one dared to speak or give an answer.

"Tap tap—"

At this moment, a knocking sound came from the door, and it was urgent.

The high-ranking official immediately said: "Come in."

The person at the door rushed in hurriedly. It was Qi Yinzhen.

He was responsible for Su Nantian’s contact and was an important figure in Su Nantian's internal communication.

So when the high-ranking official saw Qi Yinzhen, he slightly calmed his expression and urgently asked: "Quickly, what happened?"

After a pause, the high-ranking official continued to ask urgently: "Have you found anything?"

Because Qi Yinzhen was the most closely connected to Su Nantian, he might find important clues at this moment.

After thinking about it, the high-ranking official asked Qi Yinzhen with more urgency and a more anxious expression.

"Report: I have obtained all the surveillance footage from Wu’s house. Perhaps after viewing it, we can find some clues about Su Nantian!"

Qi Yinzhen was also very worried when he learned of Su Nantian’s disappearance. So he immediately rushed out and personally searched Wu's house, bringing back all the relevant clues.
