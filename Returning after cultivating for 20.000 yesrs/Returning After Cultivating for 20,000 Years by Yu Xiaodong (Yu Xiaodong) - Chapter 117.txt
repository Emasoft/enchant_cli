“Thank you, but remember our agreement—never tell anyone about this.” He smiled all day, yet his expression quickly turned harsh. “I know you’re a smart man; I’m sure you understand what’ll happen if this gets out. If you promise to keep it secret, I’ll never bother you again.”

After speaking, Su Nantian waved at him and left the massage parlor.

Today’s plan had been a complete success for Su Nantian, even exceeding his expectations. Now, all he needed to do was wait.

He waited for Wang Bo or Li Zhe—whichever one would break first, changing their mindset. Only when both of them completely shifted could Su Nantian find an opportunity to shatter their alliance.

When Su Nantian returned to the Nangong Clan that day, Nan Gong Yuyan wasn’t present. His mood was unusually cheerful, even Nangong Ping in the hall could sense it.

“Why are you so happy? Did you settle the matter at the inland port?” Nangong Ping wasn’t foolish; he guessed immediately.

“It’s not entirely resolved, but we’ve started to close the net. I’m looking forward to what happens next.” Su Nantian smiled and said.

Yet Wang Bo felt a profound humiliation, as he hadn’t expected Li Zhe to treat him this way. Wang Bo believed his influence in the inland port, though not as strong as Zhang Yu’s, was still enough to dominate Li Zhe. Now, however, Li Zhe had openly cursed him upon their meeting, leaving Wang Bo to suspect that Li Zhe must have misunderstood his status and position due to their recent alliance.

This misunderstanding made Wang Bo think he was now collaborating with Zhang Yu and Wang Bo, leading Li Zhe to believe his strength matched theirs.

Wang Bo felt this reasoning was sound; it was precisely why Li Zhe had become so arrogant. He needed to find an opportunity to teach him a lesson.

But fundamentally, Wang Bo realized the root cause was their alliance itself, which had lowered his status compared to before.

Thus, he now considered what benefits this alliance truly offered. After weighing the pros and cons, they had all agreed to take the report, but it was empty—requiring them to fill it in.

Yet this alliance had brought Wang Bo little profit. Thinking back, he recalled Su Nantian had approached him before, and a seed of thought bloomed in his mind: perhaps engaging with Su Nantian would be worthwhile.

After all, he came from the Nangong Clan; his conditions were sure to be favorable. Moreover, they would control the inland port for a year—should he build good relations with them, he could profit immensely during that time.

Thus, all of Wang Bo’s thoughts aligned perfectly; he decided to discreetly contact Su Nantian.

However, at that moment, Su Nantian was unaware Wang Bo had already taken an interest. Yet this was a positive development for Su Nantian; as long as he could offer terms, money would solve everything.

After two days passed, Su Nantian received an anonymous note instructing him to meet someone at a specific location that night.

Upon seeing this, Su Nantian immediately understood it was Wang Bo.

When Nan Gong Fei saw the note, he felt fear and said to Su Nantian: “You won’t really go, will you? It’s too dangerous.”

To Nan Gong Fei, an anonymous note was the most perilous of all. Especially when it invited you to a place—implying one should never go.

Su Nantian shook his head and said: “I’m certain this note was written by Wang Bo. He’s probably going to meet me tonight to discuss matters. Once that happens, our crisis will be resolved.”

After hearing this, Nan Gong Fei hesitated. He knew what Wang Bo represented—his alliance could dismantle the inland port’s coalition, then seize their true report.

After weighing the pros and cons, Nan Gong Fei finally nodded and said to Su Nantian: “I understand. We’ve come this far; giving up now would be a failure. Go tonight then.”

Su Nantian nodded, of course he had to go. Only by going that night could they solve their immediate problem. If he missed this opportunity, it would never come again.

Chapter 581: Negotiation

Su Nantian arrived at the place Wang Bo had arranged, only to find it was a small tavern.

As Su Nantian approached, the tavern seemed quiet and appeared to be closed. But when he stepped inside, he saw Wang Bo sitting at the center of the room, eating alone.

Hearing footsteps, Wang Bo looked up and smiled: “I didn’t think you’d actually come. I thought that note might not even get you to show up.” Wang Bo said this, clearly surprised that Su Nantian had come alone.

Wang Bo initially thought the note he’d given Su Nantian might not work, as people usually discarded anonymous notes. Especially with their current situation being less than ideal, he assumed they would be cautious. Yet Su Nantian had arrived alone.

“I came because I knew it was you. Though the note has no signature, only you could have invited me.”

Su Nantian said this while confidently sitting across from Wang Bo, appearing completely unguarded.

“Since you’ve come, I’ll be direct. I’m not one for beating around the bush.” Wang Bo said.

Su Nantian nodded and replied: “Speak, what’s the matter? It must be important—otherwise you wouldn’t have sought me out.”

“It’s about the thing you want.” Wang Bo naturally referred to the reports they had hidden.

“Are you going to return that thing to us?” Su Nantian hadn’t expected Wang Bo to bring up the topic so openly.

“It’s been burned; we only have the data now. If you want it, I can only provide the data.”

At that time, the three of them had burned all the reports completely. However, they had meticulously recorded every detail. They also printed a blank copy for Su Nantian’s group, intending to trouble them in their lives.

Moreover, they knew that if the Nangong Clan controlled the inland port, it would threaten their interests. Thus, they devised this plan.

“But if you give me these data, won’t your side suffer a loss?” Su Nantian asked again, still puzzled. He hadn’t expected Wang Bo to change his mind so quickly after a night.

“Even if we follow our current model and gain profit, my share is minimal. So it’s better for me to go solo.” Wang Bo spoke frankly. Birds of a feather flock together; once Wang Bo felt he wouldn’t gain profit from this matter, he would withdraw.

Moreover, the catalyst for Wang Bo’s anger was last night’s actions—his outrage at Li Zhe’s behavior.

“What do you want? What conditions?” Su Nantian asked, but he already had a guess—Wang Bo likely wanted money.

Indeed, Wang Bo smiled and said: “I’m just a worker in the inland port; though I’m a foreman, I’m still just a laborer. What else could I want? Money, of course.

As long as you offer me a reasonable amount, I can hand over the data directly. But you must also keep it secret—never tell anyone I leaked this. And if you can frame Li Zhe for this, I’ll ask for less money.”

Upon hearing these words, Su Nantian couldn’t help but laugh. He hadn’t expected last night’s incident to trigger such a strong chain reaction.

It was because Su Nantian had underestimated a man’s vanity and pride in front of women. Last night, Wang Bo had been humiliated by Li Zhe before a woman, which made him furious. Thus, Wang Bo began to suspect whether the rumors were true—that Li Zhe had fully defected to Zhang Yu, and they would both oppose him.

This made Wang Bo consider not only money but also whether he could completely destroy Li Zhe. He believed if he received support from the Nangong Clan, he would succeed.

Because now they were united against him, the Nangong Clan was seen as an enemy. Yet someone had leaked the data—should it be proven Li Zhe did it, Zhang Yu would avoid him.

Although they didn’t get along, Wang Bo knew their temperaments well. Zhang Yu despised any traitor within his circle. If this matter could be framed on Li Zhe, Zhang Yu would definitely distance himself from him.

This way, both weakening Li Zhe and making Zhang Yu wary of him would be a great opportunity for Wang Bo. Moreover, he had thought that if he received more support from the Nangong Clan within a year, his power would surpass Zhang Yu quickly.

All these reasons made Wang Bo think this was the right move—whether from personal feelings or his current territorial and power dynamics, he felt it was the most suitable choice.

“We can naturally agree to your demand for money. Anything that can be solved with money isn’t a problem. However, your subsequent plans pose some risk for our Nangong Clan. After all, we’ve only taken over the inland port for a year, and you people are local bosses. I fear this might backfire if it fails.”

Su Nantian deliberately didn’t agree, as he knew this was his strategy to lure Wang Bo.

If Su Nantian had immediately agreed, it would have raised suspicion. Thus, he said this to see what other conditions Wang Bo had.

Chapter 582: Reaching an Agreement

Su Nantian deliberately refused Wang Bo’s current request, which was his strategy to lure him.

If Su Nantian had immediately agreed, it would have raised suspicion. Thus, he said this to see what other conditions Wang Bo had.

“You should understand me a little. Although we need this report desperately, your three of you have equal power in the inland port. If we offend Li Zhe or Zhang Yu, our lives won’t be easy.”

Su Nantian said this deliberately. He knew the three of them had varying power levels, but Li Zhe and Wang Bo were definitely not equal.

Sure enough, after Su Nantian said this, Wang Bo’s face darkened and he angrily said: “Why should Li Zhe be equal to me? It’s only because of this damned alliance that he dared to act so boldly!”

Upon hearing Wang Bo’s words, Su Nantian felt a surge of joy. It seemed Wang Bo was already dissatisfied with the alliance, and he only needed to capitalize on this to break their unity.

Moreover, if one person in the alliance was discontented, the other two would likely also have reservations. Breaking them apart was now inevitable.

“If you’re willing to cooperate with me, I can keep this secret forever. Although I won’t help you in the inland port after that, I’ll never trouble you. As long as our interests don’t clash, we can coexist peacefully for a year. After that, when the Nangong Clan leaves, you’ll remember me kindly.”

Su Nantian could tell Wang Bo’s words were sincere. He was now deeply dissatisfied with this reason, wanting to use Su Nantian’s help to eliminate Li Zhe.

“Don’t you fear Zhang Yu and Li Zhe will unite against you?” Su Nantian continued.

Wang Bo’s expression hesitated, but then quickly turned resolute: “There are no permanent alliances. Even after this incident, Zhang Yu and Li Zhe might temporarily unite, but with conflicting interests, they won’t go far. Besides, Zhang Yu isn’t the type to entrust his back to anyone—especially not Li Zhe, a useless man.”

After Wang Bo said this, his face was full of contempt. It was clear he held Li Zhe in low regard, even calling him a “useless man.”

Su Nantian feigned contemplation for a while before looking up and saying: “Well, since you’ve said all this, it would be unwise not to trust you. Set your price; I can help with the next plan.”

“这份报表材料对于你们来说非常值钱，如果你们肯给我三十万的话我会悉数交给你，但是如果你能够把这件事情栽赃到李哲身上，让所有知情者都以为这件事情是李哲干的，那么你们只需要给我十万就可以了。”

Wang Bo said his price, and Su Nantian found it amusing. He hadn’t expected Li Zhe to be worth twenty thousand.

Actually, this price was somewhat lower than Su Nantian’s original estimate. But since it was better to spend less money to get the job done, that was ideal.

“I’ll wait a moment; about the amount of money, I need to consult my superior. You know I’m not in charge here. I’ll make a call.”

After saying this, Su Nantian turned and went to find a secluded spot to take out his phone.

In fact, according to what Nan Gong Yuyan had said before, Su Nantian could have made the decision himself and applied for ten thousand yuan from Nan Gong Yuyan.

But Su Nantian was doing Nan Gong Fei a favor. Although Nan Gong Fei was his superior in the inland port, it wouldn’t be an issue to consult him. Moreover, this decision would be made jointly with Nan Gong Fei, and after the matter was resolved, Nan Gong Fei would also gain credit.

It was essentially a favor Su Nantian gave to Nan Gong Fei.

Su Nantian called Nan Gong Fei for a long time before he answered. And when the call connected, Su Nantian heard very noisy sounds on the other end.

If he wasn’t mistaken, Nan Gong Fei was currently at a nightclub.

Su Nantian couldn’t help but smile; Nan Gong Fei had only been behaving well for a few days, yet he was already showing his true colors. He had previously stayed late to return home and act like a good boy, but now he was completely letting loose.

“Shao Ye (Young Master), I want to ask you, Wang Bo is asking us for ten thousand yuan to sell the data. Do you agree?” Su Nantian said immediately.

But Nan Gong Fei clearly didn’t hear him and asked again: “Nantian, speak louder. How much?”

“Ten thousand!”

“How much?”

“Ten thousand!” Su Nantian sighed and shouted again. Fortunately, there were no people nearby, so even if he spoke loudly, it wouldn’t draw attention.

“Ten thousand? That’s fine! It’s not much. Give it to him! You can agree with him first, and I’ll give you the money tomorrow. I have to go now; I’ve got things to do.” After saying this, Nan Gong Fei didn’t wait for Su Nantian’s reply and hung up. But at least, this matter was resolved, and Nan Gong Fei had agreed to pay.

After all, for Nan Gong Fei, this was his first position as a new official. He had already made such a big mistake, so he would naturally pay to resolve it. In the future, he could also gain face with Nan Gong Lin and avoid being criticized as a failure.

Thus, Su Nantian smiled and returned to Wang Bo, nodded at him, and said: “I just consulted my superior. I told him about your matter. He thinks this price is acceptable and very suitable. If possible, tomorrow you bring the receipt, I’ll bring the money, and we can exchange it properly. As for how to frame this matter on Li Zhe, leave that to me.”

Chapter 583: Feigned Encounter

With Su Nantian as a good helper, Nan Gong Fei had been smooth sailing recently. At first, he thought it was because he was a new official and couldn’t be as careless as before. But now, with Su Nantian handling everything for him, he realized his life was no different from before—only that he could start his狂欢 (revelry) after work.

And this time, Su Nantian had also solved their immediate problem. Nan Gong Fei only needed to bring the money over, and he didn’t have to worry about anything else.

“Exactly how did you negotiate with Wang Bo? How could he sell this data to us? Did they hide it just for money from the beginning?”

After seeing Su Nantian, Nan Gong Fei asked curiously. He didn’t know how Su Nantian had managed to create a rift between Li Zhe and Wang Bo. So now he was beginning to suspect whether they had hidden this data from the start just for money.

But Su Nantian didn’t want to tell Nan Gong Fei everything he had done. He just smiled and said: “Not exactly. They did hide this data initially to trouble us, but recently something happened between Wang Bo and Li Zhe—they started fighting each other. That’s why he did this.”

After hearing Su Nantian’s explanation, Nan Gong Fei didn’t say much but nodded. He wasn’t really interested in how this matter had unfolded; it was just a symbolic question. Since the problem was solved, that was enough for him.

But at this moment, Su Nantian smiled and said: “Young Master, but this matter still needs your final step. Without you, we can’t consider it complete.”

Su Nantian’s words surprised Nan Gong Fei. He hadn’t expected to become the final step, which was something he had never experienced in his twenty years.

Although the Nangong Clan had once placed high hopes on him, as he grew older, his flaws became more apparent. Gradually, no one in the Nangong Clan expected anything from him anymore. Some even secretly called him a failure, and no one had ever given him a key role before.

So this time, when Su Nantian said he needed to take the final step, it was truly surprising and even a bit overwhelming for Nan Gong Fei.

“Tell me what you need me to do? Whatever I can do, I’ll do it.”

Nan Gong Fei felt this matter might be very important. He couldn’t help but become energized and vowed: “If I can succeed this time, it will completely clear my name and change everyone’s opinion of me.”

“Actually, it’s not too complicated. I just need you to go to a place the day after tomorrow and have some fun there. If you meet Li Zhe, talk to him for ten minutes.” Su Nantian smiled and said.

“Is that all?” Nan Gong Fei was confused and asked blankly.

“No more, just doing this is the most important part of our plan.” Su Nantian immediately returned to a serious demeanor and said earnestly.

“What do you mean? Just go to a place for fun, then talk to Li Zhe and that’s the most important part of our plan? What exactly do you mean?” Nan Gong Fei was very puzzled. If going to a place for fun and talking to someone could complete something, he might have achieved many great things in his life.

“What’s the point of this? I can’t tell you yet, but you must believe that your step is very important. And remember what I told you—when you see Li Zhe, approach him and talk for ten minutes. Can you do it?”

After hearing Su Nantian’s question, Nan Gong Fei immediately said: “If I can’t do this, wouldn’t I be a failure? Don’t worry; tell me where and when specifically. I’ll make the arrangements.”

After hearing this, Su Nantian immediately handed him the note he had written. It contained the time and place. This location was exactly the massage parlor they had previously visited.

The timing coincided with Li Zhe’s usual schedule at the massage parlor, so Su Nantian’s move was simple and direct. Since Wang Bo had said he wanted to frame Li Zhe, this method was the most convenient.

The time came as scheduled. Nan Gong Fei arrived at the massage parlor according to Su Nantian’s note and followed his instructions to try out a few services.

At this moment, Nan Gong Fei’s phone suddenly rang. It was Su Nantian’s voice on the other end: “Young Master, it’s time. You can come to the lobby now.”

Su Nantian had already received information from the massage girl. Li Zhe was likely just leaving her, and according to his usual habits, he would go to the lobby’s leisure area for a while. He’d rest there before leaving, as he was still tired after the massage.

So Su Nantian had also instructed Nan Gong Fei to go to the lobby’s leisure area, creating a fake encounter openly.

After receiving Su Nantian’s instructions, Nan Gong Fei hung up the phone and walked out of the massage room to the lobby’s leisure area.

The number of guests that day wasn’t too many or too few, so Nan Gong Fei quickly found Li Zhe resting there.

Nan Gong Fei thought about what Su Nantian had told him—approach Li Zhe and talk for a few minutes. So he mustered his courage and sat down at the empty spot next to Li Zhe.

Then Nan Gong Fei said to Li Zhe beside him: “Hey, it’s quite a coincidence. We’ve met before, right? You’re the one from the inland port… what was your name again?”

Nan Gong Fei opened the conversation in a very direct way, but this method quickly caught Li Zhe’s attention. After all, he was resting and found someone talking loudly annoying. He was about to shout at him but saw it was Nan Gong Fei, so he had to restrain his temper and put on a smile: “Isn’t this the Young Master from the Nangong Clan? Yes, I’m Li Zhe from the inland port. I didn’t expect you to come here for fun too.”

Chapter 584: Well-Prepared

While Nan Gong Fei and Li Zhe were awkwardly chatting, they didn’t know that someone had already secretly pressed the shutter button—this was what Su Nantian had asked Wang Bo’s people to do.

Wang Bo had previously said he wanted Su Nantian to transfer the data leak to Li Zhe, and this was what Su Nantian did.

After all, such matters could be hidden for a day or two but not for years. Data being leaked again and Su Nantian’s group obtaining it was a fire that couldn’t be contained.

Thus, the wisest choice at this moment was to immediately shift everyone’s suspicion onto another person.

Plus, Wang Bo and Li Zhe had a grudge. Once they discovered the data leak, Wang Bo could directly shift everyone’s suspicion onto Li Zhe.

After all, the people there who had dealings with Su Nantian and Nan Gong Fei had no contact except for some daily matters. However, secretly Li Zhe had been seen with Nan Gong Fei, which would naturally raise suspicion.

Even if some people believed Li Zhe’s innocence, they couldn’t find evidence to clear him. Unless it was known that Wang Bo had done it.

As long as people started suspecting Li Zhe, their three-person alliance would be immediately broken. From then on, Li Zhe would never have a chance to stand equal with Wang Bo again, and Zhang Yu would also be wary of him.

At that time, Li Zhe would be isolated in the inland port, and his subordinates would lose morale. This was Wang Bo’s perfect opportunity to expand his power.

No matter how it was looked at, the end result would be Wang Bo benefiting—there wouldn’t be any other outcome.

Moreover, at this moment, Wang Bo had already received a reply from his people. They had captured Nan Gong Fei and Li Zhe together, with a short blurry video proving they were having a pleasant conversation. However, it was unclear what they had discussed.

But Nan Gong Fei and Li Zhe’s conversation didn’t matter for their current operation. As long as they had these photos and videos, it was enough.

“This Su Nantian is truly clever; he used this method to frame Li Zhe. We’ve been operating in the inland port for some time now, and this method of creating a leverage point is truly astonishing.”

Wang Bo’s evaluation of Su Nantian wasn’t low. Although he was currently cooperating with him, he had a cautious mind now. However, he knew he had made a promise to keep the peace, so Wang Bo would definitely fulfill it. Moreover, he didn’t want to become an opponent of such a person.

After Su Nantian finished his part, Wang Bo immediately handed over the data to him. Once they had this data and information, Su Nantian’s group could quickly complete their report.

Moreover, Su Nantian’s group didn’t hide the fact that they had already completed their report. Soon, other informants knew Su Nantian’s group had obtained the data.

This made Zhang Yu furious; he hadn’t expected anyone in the inland port to dare sell this data to them. Even if others knew about the seriousness of this matter, once they completed all the data, their last advantage in the inland port would be gone.

Zhang Yu took this opportunity to call Wang Bo and Li Zhe together for a meeting, preparing to investigate thoroughly who the insider was.

Moreover, this report data they had was extremely confidential, so it wasn’t accessible until a certain level. It was even more impossible to hand over this data to Su Nantian.

Zhang Yu’s expression was very gloomy, sitting across the table with his arms crossed and said to everyone in front of him: “The reason I called you all here is simple. The data we’ve been keeping has been submitted to the Nangong Clan. I’m sure everyone here knows how important this data was for us, but now it’s become worthless.

As to why the data lost its value? The reason is simple—someone among you leaked it to Su Nantian, or you received some benefit and sold it out.”

After Zhang Yu said this, he immediately scanned everyone’s faces to see if there were any signs of unease.

But no one in the room showed any unusual expressions, which made Zhang Yu even more certain that the person who leaked the data was among them.

Although Wang Bo wanted to quickly destroy Li Zhe, he knew that if he spoke up now, it would be too abrupt. This was definitely not the right time to bring it up.

Seeing that no one spoke, Zhang Yu continued earnestly: “We are an alliance now; we don’t hide anything from each other. You all know that the Nangong Clan’s arrival here is a big challenge for us. Would you really sell our data for just some money?”

Zhang Yu said this while observing everyone around him, but he still hadn’t found any clues.

However, at this moment, Wang Bo finally prepared to act.

Wang Bo had cleared his throat and said: “There’s something I need to say, but I’m not sure if it should be said.”

Wang Bo used the common opening of a TV drama and spoke in an ordinary way, but this method had great impact.

Upon hearing Wang Bo’s words, Zhang Yu immediately said: “Speak directly; there’s no need for secrets between us. Especially now that this incident has happened, if you have any clues, just say them so we can find out who the insider is.”

Zhang Yu said this while frowning. He felt this matter was more complicated than he thought, and Wang Bo seemed to know the truth.

After hearing Zhang Yu say this, Wang Bo knew his opportunity had come. From now on, he just needed to reveal the photos and videos he had taken.

Chapter 585: Unable to Defend Against Accusations

Although Zhang Yu asked Wang Bo to speak about what he knew, Wang Bo didn’t immediately reveal everything. He wore a reluctant and embarrassed expression.

Wang Bo had used all his acting skills, as he said: “I only have some clues, but I don’t have direct evidence of who did it.”

“You just need to tell us what you know. The rest can be judged by everyone else,” Zhang Yu said, and Li Zhe nodded in agreement without knowing what was coming.

“Well then, I’ll tell you what I know. The rest is up to everyone else,” Wang Bo said directly.

“What do you mean? We’ve met before in the inland port, and sometimes we have contact for work. No one has seen them privately.” Li Zhe immediately replied, refuting Wang Bo’s words.

Li Zhe and Nan Gong Fei had only met once secretly, and Li Zhe considered it an accidental meeting. Thus, he didn’t think he had met Nan Gong Fei secretly.

But after Li Zhe said this, Wang Bo felt even more joy because if he presented the evidence now, it would prove Li Zhe was lying. This way, everyone would suspect him more.

“What’s going on? You say you didn’t meet Nan Gong Fei, but Wang Bo says you did. Did your subordinates make a mistake?”

Zhang Yu frowned, now both sides were at odds. He couldn’t take sides, so he continued to ask for details.

“Of course not; they also took videos and photos. The person in the photo is clearly Nan Gong Fei and Li Zhe. I don’t know why he lied; maybe there’s something fishy here. At first, I thought they might have met accidentally, but now it seems there’s something strange.”

Even though Wang Bo said this, Li Zhe still firmly denied he had met Nan Gong Fei secretly. This was because his anger had clouded his mind, making him forget their previous meeting.

“Wang Bo, I think you’re trying to frame me. What photos and videos? We’ve never met, so how could there be such things? I think you’re trying to trick me. Or maybe you had someone impersonate me to frame me!”

Li Zhe said angrily, feeling Wang Bo was trying to frame him. He even confidently told Zhang Yu: “Have Wang Bo show these so-called photos and videos. If he can show them, I’ll admit it. But if he can’t, I think this matter is definitely him framing me; he must have a guilty conscience himself.”

Upon hearing Li Zhe’s words, Wang Bo felt even more joy. He hadn’t expected there to be someone so foolish in the world who still didn’t remember meeting Nan Gong Fei secretly.
