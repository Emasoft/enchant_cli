Su Nantian's lips curled into a bitter smile as he gently caressed Wen Ran's pale cheek, speaking softly: "Things have changed now. The matter between the Wen and Leng families is mine to resolve—rest at home, and I'll settle everything within days. Trust me!"

If Su Nantian had been alone, Wen Ran's words would have carried little weight. But Wu You'er was studying at Hangcheng University, and he knew his retreat would not earn forgiveness from the Wen or Leng families. Moreover, he was no one who relished yielding; entrusting choices to others was a slow suicide.

Wen Ran sighed softly, saying nothing more and not asking about the Wen family's affairs.

Since she left the wedding venue with Su Nantian, it symbolized her severing ties with the Wen family. From then on, all matters of the Wen family were irrelevant to her—she neither wished to involve herself nor learn about them.

An hour later, Su Nantian received a call from Leng Boxiong.

"You finally called—had you waited longer, I wouldn't have played along!" Su Nantian's gaze softened toward Wen Ran as he rose from his seat and stepped onto the balcony, smiling.

In the office of Tihao Group's chairman, Leng Boxiong's face was red with fury. He had just watched a video Su Nantian sent—showing Leng Zhifei shooting at him.

His trembling hands clutched the phone as he struggled to suppress his anger, asking coldly: "Su Nantian, what exactly do you want?"

"You're the ones who've been relentless against me. Why ask what I want?"

Su Nantian countered, his lips curling slightly—evidently in control of the situation, and he was in a good mood.

"Ugh, release Zhifei. State your conditions!"

Leng Boxiong was no stranger to the business world; he remained unshaken by Su Nantian's provocation and immediately focused on the core issue.

"You and I both know our feud is irreconcilable. Do you think I'd let Leng Zhifei go?" Su Nantian's eyes darkened as he spoke calmly.

"50 million!"

"Hah..."

"One hundred million!"

"Two hundred million!"

Leng Boxiong kept raising the stakes, his anger swelling until he longed to tear Su Nantian apart.

"Enough, Leng Boss. I know your family's rich, but there are things even money can't buy—like your son Leng Zhifei's life. How much do you think it would cost?" Su Nantian interrupted impatiently.

"What do you want then?" Leng Boxiong asked.

"Simple—Tihao Group's shares," Su Nantian smiled, waiting for this very question.

"Impossible! You're dreaming. This is extortion!"

Leng Boxiong exploded, sweeping everything off the table in front of him and shouting at Su Nantian for daydreaming.

"Hah, Leng Boss should think carefully. Your every word affects my mood, and my mood determines how well Leng's son is treated. I'm sure you're a smart man," Su Nantian said calmly, unbothered. He was the snake swallowing the elephant—there was no rush; after all, in Hangcheng, there was no Leng family if he was present. Now, it was merely about making Leng Boxiong accept this reality.

"How many shares do you want? Don't think to inflate the price—push me too far, and we'll both lose," Leng Boxiong inhaled deeply, dismissing the secretary who had entered and asked Su Nantian quietly.

"Here's an idea, Leng Boss—don't think I'm taking advantage of you. You can gather experts to challenge me. Give me four days; if anyone defeats me, I'll safely return Leng Zhifei to your family and ensure no harm comes to him," Su Nantian proposed with a smile.

"What if no one defeats you?"

Leng Boxiong hadn't been blinded by the proposal. He had seen Su Nantian's strength firsthand—even Lan Rulin, hailed as Hangcheng's top martial artist, had failed. Who knew how formidable Su Nantian truly was?

"If no one defeats me, then you must hand over Tihao Group's shares to me!"

"Such a deal—no words about Tihao Group's shares, you're quite the schemer," Leng Boxiong mocked.

"I don't commend your son's character, but I do acknowledge Tihao Group's profitability," Su Nantian said with a faint smile.

"Oh? Then I should thank you for acknowledging Tihao Group,"

"Frankly, I don't care about your Tihao Group. I could easily take down the Leng family outright, but considering you might panic and act recklessly, I'm willing to give you a chance. Let's play—make you lose with your head held high!"

Su Nantian truly didn't care about Tihao Group; money had long since become meaningless to him.

However, considering Wen Ran couldn't stay at home indefinitely, Su Nantian wanted to find her a task. As the second daughter of the Wen family, Tihao Group was more than enough to let her shine.

"You're quite honest—such a young man staying in Hangcheng is truly wasted," Leng Boxiong's anger gradually subsided, beginning to objectively assess the situation. But upon careful consideration, he couldn't help but admire Su Nantian's cunning—single-handedly scheming against an entire Tihao Group with a real chance of success. Truly bold and meticulous, astonishing.

"I have some self-awareness, Leng Boss. Don't bother trying to flatter me. The recording's useless—better accept the challenge. I'm sure you don't want this to become public, do you?"

Su Nantian had nothing to lose; he was determined to drag Leng Boxiong into the water. Building relationships with him was a waste of time.

"Since it's a mutual challenge, young man, don't you think your stakes are too low?"

Leng Boxiong sighed helplessly. Opposite him was a shrewd man who had nearly made him forget his age. If he hadn't known the other's age, he might have thought it was a business rival targeting him.

"Low stakes? I don't think so. A single son of yours—such a stake is more than enough, isn't it?"

Su Nantian had had Zhang Bao investigate Leng Boxiong. He knew he had only one son, Leng Zhifei. He didn't believe Leng Boxiong, at his age, had only one son without considering having another.

Chapter 382: Provocation

Since there were no additional stakes, it was clear he lacked the strength. Bloodline and descendants were still highly valued in families like the Lengs, so Su Nantian had no fear of Leng Boxiong's resistance.

Leng Boxiong remained silent, offering no reply.

"Here's an idea—since you think the stakes are too low, add me as well. If I lose, I'll serve you for ten years. Of course, if you find me annoying in your presence, I can leave Hangcheng and never return."

That was how he spoke, but Su Nantian had no intention of losing. It was merely a hollow promise to get Leng Boxiong to accept the challenge.

Leng Boxiong's breath quickened. He still highly valued Su Nantian's strength but doubted he could be of use to him, so he was caught in deep deliberation.

After much thought, Leng Boxiong spoke: "If you lose, marry my son Wu You'er to me and serve for ten years. Of course, not in Hangcheng..."

"No way, Wu You'er won't marry your son. Change the condition, Leng Boss—I've shown enough sincerity!"

Su Nantian coldly refused. Wu You'er and Wen Ran were his taboos; even if he knew he wouldn't lose, he wouldn't use them as pawns. It wasn't about winning or losing but about their place in his heart and peace!

Leng Boxiong's mind stirred, elevating Wu You'er's importance in Su Nantian's heart. He planned to take her as his own once Su Nantian failed, but it was merely a test. Seeing Su Nantian refuse, he didn't mind.

"Fine, since you're unwilling, I won't insist. I'll find someone to challenge you. If you lose, don't blame me for being ruthless!"

Leng Boxiong issued a threat. He wanted Su Nantian to retreat, but he knew if Su Nantian had issued the challenge, he must have prepared mentally. This threat would not work.

"Then I await your arrival!" Su Nantian didn't let Leng Boxiong continue his nonsense, hanging up the phone immediately.

Gazing at the beautiful scenery outside the balcony, Su Nantian narrowed his eyes for a moment before pulling out his phone and calling Zhang Bao: "Zhang Bao?"

"Master Su? What's your command?"

"Prepare to find someone matching Leng Zhifei and Wen Liang's physique. We'll switch them out, first moving Leng Zhifei from Leng Boxiong's sight!"

Su Nantian spoke quietly: "With Tihao Group's wealth, having more martial artists is normal. If they gather to storm the villa and rescue Leng Zhifei, your few men won't stop them."

"Master Su, the villa's surroundings are all Leng Boxiong's people. Everyone entering and exiting is monitored. It's not easy to switch them out," Zhang Bao expressed concern.

"Then have your men disperse Leng Boxiong's people and find more substitutes. I don't believe Leng Boxiong's men can watch over one person but not twenty or even a hundred. As long as identities are concealed, the truth becomes false—constantly entering and exiting will keep Leng Boxiong unaware of his son's whereabouts!"

Su Nantian had only one crucial stake—Leng Zhifei. If Leng Boxiong lost him, his challenge would end before it began. Then the enraged Leng family might turn against him.

Su Nantian wasn't afraid, but this one chance to enter Tihao Group would vanish. He didn't want to taste failure.

"Don't worry, Master Su—I understand what to do!"

"Don't be stubborn and drive home. With so much time on the road, whether it's traffic lights or accidents, take advantage of vehicles passing each other to move Leng Zhifei. That'll keep Leng Boxiong confused!"

Su Nantian feared Zhang Bao lacked experience, so he taught him a few tricks to ensure success in moving Leng Zhifei from the villa.

"Good, I understand, Master Su. What about Wen Liang?" Zhang Bao replied and asked.

"Wen Liang?"

Su Nantian paused, his eyes flashing with coldness before smiling: "Let Wen Liang return!"

"Ah? Let him go?"

"Yes, let Wen Liang return. If he does, and Leng Zhifei doesn't, it'll make the Lengs and Wens fight each other—dogs fighting over a bone!" Zhang Bao understood upon Su Nantian's suggestion.

"Find an accident, let Wen Liang return. Ideally, give him a chance to rescue Leng Zhifei. That should make Leng Boxiong turn against the Wen family!" Su Nantian coldly arranged.

After receiving Su Nantian's orders, Zhang Bao carried out the plan smoothly. The next afternoon in the Wen family villa:

"Tell me, what's going on?"

Furious, Leng Boxiong hurled a tablet onto Wen Hai's face, scaring him into trembling like a quail.

Wen Hai nervously picked up the tablet, its video showing a car accident scene with blurry footage from a street camera. Despite this, the content was clear:
The streets were crowded with scraped vehicles. A man jumped out of a car, clearly Wen Liang, who had been kidnapped.
Wen Liang was frantic, fleeing without looking back, while another young man—Leng Zhifei—followed.
Unknown to Leng Zhifei, he had injured his ankle and couldn't run fast, so he begged Wen Liang for help.
But Wen Liang glanced back and left without looking, while Leng Zhifei was quickly subdued by black-clad men and beaten before being forcibly returned to the car.

"Did I not treat the Wen family well? This is how you repay me?"
After Wen Hai watched the video, Leng Boxiong glared at him with fierce eyes, as if he would devour Wen Hai if he didn't get a satisfactory answer.
Wen Hai's throat bobbed, swallowing nervously as he wiped the cold sweat from his forehead. He forced a smile to explain: "Leng elder, my son was kidnapped and frightened. In such a situation, he couldn't..."
"Silence! This is Wen Liang's excuse for not helping? Where is he now? Why hasn't he come to see me? I want to ask him directly—what did Leng Zhifei do to offend him, that he wouldn't help at the crucial moment?"
Leng Boxiong rudely interrupted Wen Hai's words. The anger he had accumulated from Su Nantian now had a target, exploding like fire on oil!
Wen Hai's face darkened as he said coldly: "Leng elder, are you trying to oppose me? Can you bear my family's..."
Wen Hai coldly glanced at Leng Boxiong, scoffing: "You have time to target me—why not focus on rescuing your son? I think Su Nantian isn't an easy opponent. Be careful not to lose in a ditch!"
"Good, good. If my son dies, Wen Liang will die with him. Not even heaven's king can help!"
Leng Boxiong had intended to seek the Wen family's help but ended up clashing with them.
Clash it was—after all, the Leng family could easily destroy the Wen family. Once he rescued his son and had time, he'd plunge the Wen family into an abyss.
Bang!
With a loud crash, Leng Boxiong slammed the door and left.
Watching Leng Boxiong's back, Wen Hai ran his hands through his hair in frustration. He hadn't expected the marriage alliance that was meant to elevate the Wen family would turn into a disaster, making him deeply regretful.
"Ah, that's the fate of dealing with tigers!"
Wen Hai sighed helplessly. The Wen family was still too weak.
After Leng Boxiong left, his wife Feng Yi entered from a side door with Wen Liang, who had indeed returned home.
"Is there truly no solution?"
Feng Yi comforted Wen Liang, who was silent and heartbroken, asking Wen Hai with concern.
"There's one more way," Wen Hai thought deeply, his eyes flashing coldly as he whispered.
At that moment, Wen Liang also realized it and looked up with a glimmer of hope. But thinking about his poor relationship with Su Nantian, he felt regretful and shook his head helplessly.
"What's the way?"
Feng Yi, confused by her husband and son's cryptic words, felt a flicker of hope and asked hurriedly.
"The only way is to wait," Wen Hai said with intense eyes.
"Wait?" Feng Yi was still confused.
"Su Nantian has insulted the Leng family and kidnapped Leng Boxiong's only son. Now it's a life-or-death battle. We'll see whether Su Nantian, the overland dragon, has stronger hands or Leng Boxiong, the local snake, is more skilled!"
When Wen Hai mentioned Su Nantian, he suddenly remembered Wen Ran. Perhaps marrying her to him would be good. Now, he was a young man with potential.
"Su Nantian? The one who took away Ran?"
Feng Yi was surprised. Su Nantian had only given her a slight impression with his good martial arts, but she knew nothing else. After all, the Wen family treated Su Nantian as an enemy, and she hadn't sent anyone to investigate.
"If I had started with no confidence in him, but look at now—letting Wen Liang return was a simple stratagem that made the Wen and Leng families turn against each other, even becoming enemies. This isn't a brute's cunning. I must admit I'm beginning to look forward to Su Nantian and Leng Boxiong's fight!"
Wen Hai ignored his wife's short-sightedness and muttered.
Having spent so many years in Hangcheng's business world, he had this insight. But if he were to switch places with Su Nantian, he wouldn't have been as decisive. It was precisely because he couldn't that he had a glimmer of hope in Su Nantian.
Whether the Wen family would be destroyed by the Lengs or Wen Ran's future, Wen Hai now hoped Su Nantian would win. It was truly amusing.
"Alright, from now on, don't show disdain for Su Nantian. Su Nantian has changed—he's no longer the same as before. If you don't change your view, you'll eventually drag the Wen family into the abyss!"
Wen Hai scolded his wife and looked at Wen Liang, who was silent and deeply hurt. He shook his head and decided to communicate with Su Nantian himself.
At Su Nantian's new villa, he was chatting with Wen Ran when the phone rang. He answered it.
"This is Wen Hai, father of Wen Ran!"
Wen Hai wanted to show a bit of goodwill but remembered Su Nantian's scene at the wedding. His tone was stiff.
Fortunately, Su Nantian didn't take it personally. After all, he knew he was Wen Ran's father. He asked casually: "Hello, what's up?"
His tone was casual, but Wen Ran, who overheard, became tense. After all, she was blood-related. Even though she had severed ties with the Wen family, she still cared about Wen Hai's attitude toward Su Nantian.
As a child, who wouldn't want their parents' blessing? Who would want to be at odds with family? Wen Ran was just a rich kid, not heartless.
Su Nantian noticed Wen Ran's emotions and gently patted her hand, signaling everything was under control.
Wen Hai hesitated: "Young man, I admit we underestimated you. But if you want to oppose the Leng family, you lack depth."
"What do you mean? Do you plan to invest in me?" Su Nantian interrupted Wen Hai, asking with a smile.
Wen Hai took a deep breath and said: "I must admit your stratagem was effective. It made a father who had almost lost his son lose his mind. Even if this father is the chairman of Tihao Group..."
"Enough, enough, Mr. Wen. I know my affairs. If you want to praise me, I don't need it. Save those words for your son. I think he's been deeply hurt!"
Su Nantian recalled the scene of Wen Liang fleeing. He almost couldn't believe this was the arrogant Wen family's eldest son.
His high-end casual clothes were stained with some dirt, his eyes lifeless, staring at nowhere. His handsome face had lost several levels of attractiveness due to his despair.
If it weren't for Zhang Bao treating Wen Liang as a guest, he would have thought his men had abused him.
Clearly, a small setback had deeply wounded this proud Wen eldest son. Whether it was Leng Zhifei's disdain or his own worthlessness, he couldn't tell.
Wen Hai paused for a moment and continued: "I know your relationship with Wen Ran. From now on, the Wen family won't oppose you and Wen Ran being together. If you truly defeat Leng Boxiong, I can arrange for Wen Ran to marry you!"
Su Nantian let out a light laugh, mocking: "You really are addicted to selling your daughter. Whether Wen Ran wants to marry me is her own business, and mine too. What does it have to do with your Wen family?"
"I know the Wen family is now at odds with the Lengs, so it's not easy. But that doesn't mean I have to ally with the Wen family!"
Chapter 384: Conditions

"An enemy's enemy is a friend, Su Nantian. If you're still holding grudges over past events, I'm willing to apologize and say sorry. But if you want to defeat the Lengs, without support, you..."
Wen Hai earnestly tried to persuade Su Nantian to join the Wen family, but Su Nantian had no intention of looking at the Wen family.
The world still valued strength, and wealth was just a decoration. As a true martial artist, they wouldn't care about these things.
"I can handle the Lengs myself. If the Wen family really wants to invest in me, let Wen Ran be the next head of the Wen family!"
Su Nantian's mind stirred, his gaze full of tenderness toward Wen Ran. He began to negotiate with Wen Hai.
"Wen Ran? The head of the Wen family?"
Wen Hai was surprised. If Wen Ran became the head, what about his son Wen Liang?
Moreover, in family traditions, it was unthinkable for a woman destined to marry an outsider to become the head!
"What's wrong?" Su Nantian stopped Wen Ran from refusing, signaling everything was under control.
Wen Ran hadn't been interested in the Wen family's wealth, but Su Nantian had accumulated considerable money. However, thinking about becoming the master of her former puppet and marriage tool into a ruler, she felt some temptation.
But fearing Su Nantian and Wen Hai's relationship would deteriorate, she didn't want Su Nantian to be so demanding.
Wen Hai hesitated: "The Wen family has no precedent of a woman being head..."
"No precedent, but if Wen Ran becomes one, there will be. Isn't that right?" Su Nantian said with a slight smile.
To pull him on board, he was unwilling to pay the price. But if Wen Ran became head, Wen Liang would be a problem. This man still needed to be completely eliminated by the Lengs.
"You really are a big mouth," Wen Hai sighed with resentment.
"I have only one connection to the Wen family—Wen Ran. You know that. Whether the Wen family wants to rise again or continue in a daze, it's all in your hands."
"Of course, you don't need to decide immediately. After all, I still have some time with the Lengs. Wait for the right moment to bet. I allow the Wen family to do this, but it's better to jump in early and gain more!"
Watching Su Nantian casually chatting with his father, Wen Ran's eyes were full of love. She hadn't expected Su Nantian to give her anything, but who wouldn't want their man to be strong?
Especially Su Nantian—a man with both literary and martial skills. His strength could easily defeat dozens of bodyguards, even defeating the top martial artist in Hangcheng, Lan Rulin. With a small trick, he had made the Lengs and Wen families panic. Despite their powerful forces, they couldn't handle Su Nantian. Such a man was truly intoxicating to Wen Ran.
On the other end of the phone, Wen Hai was conflicted. He did want to gamble as Su Nantian suggested.
But he had the entire Wen family behind him. If he made a mistake, there would be no turning back—only a massive blow. He needed time to think carefully.
Sparing Wen Ran's feelings, Wen Hai didn't want to sabotage Su Nantian in secret. He would stay neutral, allowing Wen Ran to consider family ties. When Su Nantian's rise was unstoppable, he could let Wen Ran return home.
After making up his mind, Wen Hai politely said a few words and hung up the phone.
Of course, he didn't forget to care about Wen Ran at the end of the call—whether it was pretense or genuine, it made Wen Ran feel a little better after fleeing the wedding.
"Nantian, are you really not holding a grudge against the Wen family?"
Wen Ran asked with her eyes, fearing Su Nantian's decision would make him委屈. That would only deepen her guilt.
"Relax, the Wen family except for a few people I dislike, is generally acceptable..."
Su Nantian silently added: After all, once you become the head of the Wen family, those people will be at your mercy.
"If I truly become the head of the Wen family, I'll make them kneel and apologize!" Wen Ran said with a look of hatred toward those who looked down on Su Nantian, speaking tenderly.
Even if they were her own brother or mother, it was the same!
"Hah, then I'll congratulate you in advance for becoming the head of the Wen family. Future if you can't eat, I'll beg the Wen family for a meal!" Su Nantian laughed and teased.
Wen Ran "Ah" and rushed into his arms, teasing: "You keep doing this, I won't talk to you anymore!"
As they played and laughed, three figures suddenly appeared at the entrance of Leng Zhifei's villa. Their eyes were sharp, and their movements were like the wind—clearly experts.
"Is this where the Leng family's son is?" A slightly aged voice carried a hint of mockery.
"He's been moved several times already. Leng Boxiong is treating a dead horse as alive. I think this time it's just a wasted trip!"
One of the middle-aged men said reluctantly. But they were hired experts by Leng Boxiong, so it was up to him.
Regardless of whether Leng Zhifei was there or not, they had to search the villa. Even if nothing was found, they would have to deal with those guarding it—this was also a way to retaliate against Su Nantian's humiliation.
"Just knock them out, don't kill them. This task is really troublesome!"
The dim streetlights illuminated the speaker's body, but it was an old man with white hair. Yet his eyes flashed coldly when he said "kill," as if seeing prey. He was a killer.
"Taking others' money, doing their work—this is our rule. Don't complain so much. Finish the job quickly. I have a little beauty waiting for me in my room!"
The middle-aged man shrugged indifferently. Suddenly, he smiled lewdly.
They all knew that rescuing a hostage was the most dangerous task—angering the kidnapper could lead to early execution. Though they were dissatisfied with Leng Boxiong's arrangement, they still had to do it.
Of course, the middle-aged man's luck made the other two old men envious, who muttered "you'll die on a woman's belly" in resentment.
Then the three figures lightened their steps and jumped into the villa walls, never disturbing any security measures.
Chapter 385: Reluctantly Agree

Looking at the dark villa, the three men exchanged glances and signaled each other. They moved like leopards in three directions, quickly approaching the villa.
They were about to peek inside when the lights in the villa suddenly turned on, blinding them. No matter how skilled they were, they couldn't suppress their instinct to squint.
At the moment they squinted, three dark shadows pierced the air with a sharp whistle and flew toward them.
"Traps! Be careful!"
The middle-aged man ignored his cover and shouted, crouching to dodge the incoming shadows. But before he could react, a pile of flour fell from above, covering his face.
Then a stream of water came, mixed with cold flour that was half-wet and half-dry. It stuck to the middle-aged man's face, blurring his vision.
They heard a commotion around them and the sound of sticks whistling through the air, then a heavy hit on his head. The middle-aged man was dazed.
"Damn it, you're playing dirty?"
The middle-aged man gave up trying to pull the flour off his face and punched with fists like cannons, forcing everyone around him to stay away.
The other two old men had a similar experience—being tricked by the flour, they could only wander aimlessly.
"Entering a private residence—how can I punish you without reason?"
A clear voice spoke with disdain. The speaker was Zhang Bao, who had received Su Nantian's guidance and come to the villa.
Su Nantian had anticipated that Leng Boxiong's suspicious nature would send people to check on the villa where Leng Zhifei was supposedly held. He had specifically arranged for Zhang Bao to wait and set various tricks to welcome the intruders.
First, the sudden bright lights in the dark—since the villa's surroundings were dim, people who adapted to darkness would instinctively squint when exposed to bright light. Unless they were top-tier warriors in constant life-and-death battles, no one could suppress this instinct.
Leng Zhifei's transfer had already been reported to Leng Boxiong, so he wouldn't send real experts to check a villa that would yield nothing. For these mediocre "experts," Zhang Bao and his men were more than enough.
When the intruders squinted, it was their most alert moment. Flour could be dodged, but if stones or other projectiles were thrown beforehand, they would dodge—just as Zhang Bao predicted, the flour could hit them.
Blind enemies were like blind men; if Zhang Bao couldn't defeat three strong blind men, he was too low.
"Damn it, have the courage to fight openly! Cowards are losers!"
The middle-aged man trembled with anger. He hadn't expected to be caught so early, and it was a humiliating defeat.
"Hah, stubborn!"
Zhang Bao didn't waste words. He waved his hand, and several men with iron basins approached. The basins were steaming—boiling water.
As the three men punched and relied on memory to retreat, several basins of hot water were poured over them. Overwhelmingly, the three men couldn't escape and screamed in agony.
Zhang Bao coldly glanced at them, his heart unmoved. He knew if it weren't for Su Nantian's guidance pointing out their weaknesses, he wouldn't have won so easily. If he had fallen into their hands, his fate would be no better than theirs.
Then Zhang Bao waved his hand again. The men hiding in the grass nodded and opened the valve, spraying a cold water jet. After hot water came cold—fire and ice. The three experts were in chaos, their skin red and lifeless.
"Capture them. Treat the injured—don't let them die!"
After looking at the three men rolling in pain, Zhang Bao coldly turned and walked into the villa. The remaining men smiled cruelly, grabbed ropes, and rushed to bind the three men tightly.
In the top office of Tihao Group, Leng Boxiong paced anxiously. Two men in traditional Chinese attire stood by, their expressions calm as they occasionally glanced at Leng Boxiong with disdain.
One of them said impatiently: "Leng Boss, since you chose us for the task, trust in our abilities. Wait a little longer; my men will bring you news soon!"
Leng Boxiong sighed bitterly, shaking his head: "It's not that I don't trust you. It's that I fear Su Nantian too much. If this test angers him, won't my unfortunate son be in more trouble?"
The two men exchanged glances, sighed, and said nothing. They waited for the three to bring good news.
Ring! Ring!
The pleasant phone ring sounded, and the head of the secret agents, Qi Yinzhen, reflexively picked up his phone. He suddenly realized it wasn't his phone.
Leng Boxiong was startled and picked up the phone, which received a video from an unknown number.
"Damn it, something must have gone wrong!"
Qi Yinzhen's face darkened immediately and approached Leng Boxiong, nodding to open the video.
Indeed, the video showed three men in traditional Chinese attire, grimacing and crying out in pain—exactly his three subordinates sent to test.
A new message arrived, and Leng Boxiong instinctively opened it.
"Don't play tricks. If you want to fight, do it openly. I don't believe your family can't find experts. If you provoke me again, my temper won't hold!"
This arrogant tone needed no explanation—Leng Boxiong knew it was Su Nantian's message!
"Damn it, damn it!"
Leng Boxiong angrily threw the phone, which shattered into pieces. The two secret agents' faces were also unpleased.
"Master Leng, since it's like this, let my men fight him openly!"
Qi Yinzhen was furious. He had thought it would be easy to make money, but the opponent was clearly a master. His fingers interlocked and made a "crack" sound, deciding to take matters into his own hands.
Leng Boxiong looked at him and then at the other head, Qi Yeyu, finally nodding. He picked up his phone and called Su Nantian: "Hello, I accept your challenge!"
Su Nantian smiled and asked: "Are you sure? Once you accept the challenge, you can't back out!"
Leng Boxiong swallowed his saliva, feeling a bit uneasy. He looked at Qi Yinzhen and the two brothers before making his decision: "I accept your challenge. Five matches, each giving you twenty percent of Tihao Group's shares. But if you lose one match, everything is forfeited and you must fulfill your promise!"
Chapter 386: Witnesses

After hearing Leng Boxiong's challenge rules, Su Nantian couldn't help but coldly laugh. The conditions Leng Boxiong proposed were extremely harsh.
Su Nantian had to win all five matches to get the entire Tihao Group's shares, but if he lost one match, everything would be zero.
It was undeniable that Leng Boxiong was truly a cunning old fox, and this rule was absolutely beneficial to him.
"Hah, Leng Boxiong, you're really a cunning old fox. Do you think you have the right to negotiate with me?"
Su Nantian wasn't afraid, but he was angry. This clearly was provoking him.
"I..."
