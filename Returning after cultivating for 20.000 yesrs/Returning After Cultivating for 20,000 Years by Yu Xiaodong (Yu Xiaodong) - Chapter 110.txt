“Then that’s truly excellent. My mission here is now complete, and I can depart for the Nangong Family immediately.” Su Nantian smiled and nodded.

Yuan Daying also nodded upon hearing this, then waved to He Zun who was busy over there. “He Zun, come here.”

Upon hearing Yuan Daying’s call, He Zun immediately set down his belongings and approached.

“What is it, boss? What do you need from me?” He Zun asked, his eyes scanning the figure standing nearby—Su Nantian. This matter was surely connected to him.

“You need to fetch some paper and a brush. We had already promised Su Nantian before, hadn’t we? If he wins this time for us, the Sea King Gang will no longer demand a single coin from the Nangong Family, and their people can leave Ruohai District. Also, inform your subordinates that from now on, they must not treat the Nangong Family with hostility.”

After issuing this order, Yuan Daying turned to Su Nantian and said: “It would be impractical for you to leave overnight. Give you a week to take everything from Ruohai District. I guarantee that during this period, no one from the Sea King Gang will harm you. Rest assured.”

“But boss, are you truly willing to honor this boy’s request?” He Zun frowned and asked.

“What do you mean? We had already agreed, so we must follow through. Do you intend to make me retract my word and disgrace my reputation?” Yuan Daying grew angry upon hearing He Zun’s words, as the latter’s tone clearly indicated a desire to backtrack.

“This seems unwise. We had already agreed beforehand—there’s no reason to renege now,” Su Nantian said calmly, knowing that regardless of He Zun’s words, Yuan Daying would not change his mind. He had already discerned Yuan Daying’s temperament during the earlier match, where He Zun had consistently opposed his participation but Yuan Daying had steadfastly upheld his stance. Thus, Yuan Daying would not alter his decision.

“Rest assured, I will not renege. He Zun, do as I said and don’t pull any tricks behind my back,” Yuan Daying said while pointing at He Zun.

“Alright, now take this young man down and have the document sent back to him by car,” Yuan Daying said, waving his hand to signal He Zun to escort Su Nantian away.

Su Nantian grinned and trailed behind, waving goodbye to Yuan Daying before heading out.

There was no choice; despite He Zun’s strong reluctance, he still followed Yuan Daying’s instructions and wrote a document for Su Nantian.

“Take this food and leave quickly. From now on, the Nangong Family has no connection with the Sea King Gang. You shouldn’t expect to establish any contact with them again. My boss is benevolent, but that doesn’t mean I am. I’ve already seen through your little schemes. Don’t think you can get anything from the Sea King Gang this time. Just leave,” He Zun said before tossing the paper to Su Nantian and summoning a subordinate to drive him back.

After confirming the document’s authenticity, Su Nantian waved goodbye to He Zun and said: “Don’t worry. If fate allows, we’ll meet again. I still have some connection with the Sea King Gang.”

After saying this, Su Nantian laughed and walked out with the subordinate, leaving He Zun alone, his face dark.

He knew that even if he told Yuan Daying what Su Nantian had said, Yuan Daying might not believe him. Instead, he would think He Zun was biased against Su Nantian.

But he had indeed confirmed that Su Nantian harbored ambitions toward the Sea King Gang. Yet, upon reflection, he thought: what kind of trouble could a mere Nangong Family bodyguard cause? And with the Nangong Family’s complete withdrawal from Ruohai District, he might never connect with the Sea King Gang again. Thus, there was no need to be so anxious.

Su Nantian was merely a bodyguard with better combat skills. How could he shake the Sea King Gang?

Chapter 544: Completing the Impossible

After Su Nantian received the document from He Zun and returned to Ruohai District, Wang Dasha and his group were idly sitting in the hall.

Normally, they had nothing to do but constantly worry about the Sea King Gang. However, today they knew the Sea King Gang had apparently gone out collectively and taken Su Nantian with them.

Thus, Wang Dasha’s group had an unusually pleasant day without fear of the Sea King Gang showing up.

But just then, they heard a car engine outside. They looked out and saw a vehicle parked at the entrance.

There was no need to guess—it had to be the Sea King Gang’s car. No one else dared park so openly in Ruohai District, except for Su Nantian who had come here before.

“Could it be that the ‘Nantian’ has returned?” Liu Miao looked out but couldn’t see who was inside, so he speculated.

“I think it’s likely. Otherwise, no one else would come here. The Sea King Gang has already collected the money they demanded, and we’ve even paid double. They have no reason to come back now,” Liu Zhiping nodded in agreement.

“Look, it’s really Nantian!” Sun Qi pointed at the person getting out of the car.

The group quickly scattered from the window and returned to their seats, pretending nothing had happened.

Su Nantian stepped out of the car effortlessly and smiled at Wang Dasha and his group. “You’re all here? I have some good news for you—your time to leave is now.”

Wang Dasha was confused. “What do you mean?”

“I told you before, my purpose here was to free the Nangong Family from the Sea King Gang. Now they’ve agreed never to demand money again, and you no longer need to stay here. The Sea King Gang said you have a week to pack up and leave. I’ll return to the Nangong Family today to inform them.”

After saying this, Su Nantian prepared to go upstairs and pack his belongings before driving back to the Nangong Family.

“Do you mean we can leave?” Wang Dasha still couldn’t believe it. They had no idea how this happened, and Su Nantian had only been here a few days yet managed to create miracles. Not only did he escape the Sea King Gang unharmed, but now he claimed they had let go of the Nangong Family. It was incredible.

“Yes, the Sea King Gang has said they’ll no longer demand money from the Nangong Family. There’s no point in you staying here anymore. From now on, the Nangong Family and Sea King Gang are officially severed,” Su Nantian said.

After speaking, Su Nantian didn’t pay attention to Wang Dasha and others anymore. He went upstairs to pack his belongings quickly.

When Su Nantian finished packing and took the car keys, Wang Dasha’s group was still stunned. They had seen Su Nantian truly carrying his backpack and the car keys, indicating he was leaving. Only then did they realize this might be real.

After Su Nantian started the car and drove off with a roaring engine, they finally believed this event was real.

Wang Dasha immediately pulled out his phone and called Zeng Chao.

Zeng Chao had been monitoring his phone these days, hoping to hear more news about Su Nantian. He had long hoped that the Sea King Gang would teach Su Nantian a lesson.

But now his phone finally rang, and it was Wang Dasha’s number. This made Zeng Chao extremely excited. It seemed the Sea King Gang had taken action again today.

“I said the Sea King Gang wouldn’t let that kid off. Perhaps something happened yesterday, preventing them from acting on him. I guess they’ll beat him up today,” Zeng Chao thought happily while answering the call, hearing Wang Dasha’s excited tone.

“Chao Ge, I have big news to tell you!”

Zeng Chao was genuinely surprised by Wang Dasha’s excitement and said, “Take your time to explain carefully. Don’t rush; I have plenty of patience to listen. This is a happy event, so we should savor it slowly.”

Wang Dasha was confused upon hearing Zeng Chao’s words. Normally, they should have known about this first. Had Su Nantian already called Zeng Chao?

But since Zeng Chao told him to speak slowly, Wang Dasha didn’t hesitate and continued with his excited tone: “Su Nantian just returned and then left again. He said the Sea King Gang has agreed for us to leave, so from now on, they’ll have no more dealings with the Nangong Family. Can we leave too?”

After Wang Dasha said this, he rubbed his hands excitedly, hoping Zeng Chao would immediately transfer them to the Nangong Family’s headquarters. That way, his heart wouldn’t feel empty. He had heard that working in the Nangong Family was actually quite easy.

After all, the Nangong Family’s security conditions were excellent. Their bodyguards mainly patrolled and rarely encountered incidents.

“Wait, what did you say? Repeat it!” Zeng Chao’s smile gradually faded. He hadn’t expected this news, thinking Wang Dasha was excited because Su Nantian had been beaten up. He hadn’t anticipated that Su Nantian had actually completed this impossible mission.

Wang Dasha hesitated, unsure whether to repeat it. Meanwhile, Zeng Chao was already furious.

“I don’t believe it! How did this kid get so lucky to pull off such a thing? Is the Sea King Gang all softies? They’re supposed to be so strong, yet they’ve been completely subdued by this Su Nantian! What did he do? Is he a sorcerer?”

Zeng Chao was genuinely puzzled. He couldn’t understand how Su Nantian had actually managed to complete this impossible mission.

Chapter 545: Returning to the Nangong Family

Su Nantian immediately drove back to the Nangong Family, as he had a badge given by Nangong Ping that proved his identity. Thus, it was easy for him to enter the Nangong Family.

After returning, Su Nantian immediately went to see Nangong Ping. Upon seeing Su Nantian return, Nangong Ping was both excited and surprised.

“Su Nantian, how did you return? You were supposed to be dealing with the Sea King Gang in Ruohai District. If you escaped on your own, I’ll have a hard time explaining it. Take some things and leave quickly before they notice you. I’ll talk to my father later, don’t worry.”

Nangong Ping thought Su Nantian had returned on his own. He glanced around to ensure no one else noticed and said this.

Su Nantian smiled and said, “Master, don’t worry. I’ve returned properly. Look at this.”

He then took out the paper He Zun had written and showed it to Nangong Ping.

“This… is real?” Nangong Ping couldn’t believe it. He couldn’t imagine that Su Nantian had resolved their long-standing problem in just a few days.

Although the Sea King Gang’s monthly payments weren’t a huge sum for the Nangong Family, the constant harassment and worries about Ruohai District were very tedious.

“Later, you can verify with the Sea King Gang. They’ve already told us to evacuate within a week,” Su Nantian nodded.

“That’s definitely good news. Now come with me to see Father immediately. You’ve not only returned but also accomplished a great feat for the Nangong Family,” Nangong Ping was very excited and pulled Su Nantian toward Nangong Lin’s villa.

At that moment, Nangong Lin was sitting in the living room reading a newspaper. He suddenly heard hurried footsteps outside and the voices of the housekeeper and Nangong Ping, so he looked up.

But at that moment, Nangong Lin saw Su Nantian standing behind Nangong Ping and was angry. “Nantian, what’s going on? You were supposed to be in Ruohai District. Did you return私自?”

After saying this, Nangong Lin looked at Nangong Ping but noticed he was very happy. He then scowled and said, “What’s going on? I told you not to plead for this kid. I won’t agree. Only after he completes the task will I let him return. You’ve punished me by letting him come back.”

Nangong Lin thought Su Nantian had returned because Nangong Ping had let him go, so he said this and even threatened to punish Nangong Ping.

At that moment, Nangong Ping took out the paper and handed it to Nangong Lin.

“Father, look at this. Nantian didn’t return on his own or did I let him go. He’s already completed the task.”

After hearing Nangong Ping, Nangong Lin was also surprised. He opened the paper and saw its content, then was very shocked.

“Is this real?” Nangong Lin couldn’t believe it.

Su Nantian nodded and said, “Yes, Master. This was written by He Zun himself. If you have any doubts, you can call them to confirm.”

Upon hearing this, Nangong Lin immediately took out his phone and called Yuan Daying.

Although the Nangong Family rarely contacted the Sea King Gang directly, they had contact information with Yuan Daying. Thus, verifying this was simple.

“Nangong Lin, I knew you’d call me,” Yuan Daying answered the phone shortly after. He directly addressed Nangong Lin by name, indicating that the Sea King Gang didn’t fear the major families.

Upon hearing Yuan Daying’s words, Nangong Lin knew it was true.

“Seems you already know why I called. Please confirm for me: is the paper our bodyguard brought back real? Will the Sea King Gang no longer bother us Nangong Family?” Nangong Lin continued.

“Ha ha, I must say your bodyguard is no ordinary person. Yes, he did a favor for me and exchanged this condition. From now on, the Sea King Gang has no more dealings with your Nangong Family. Your people should leave immediately,” Yuan Daying said while laughing and speaking generously.

“Good, I understand. Thank you.” Nangong Lin said.

“You don’t need to thank me. If you really want to, reward your Nangong Family’s little bodyguard,” Yuan Daying said before hanging up.

“How about it, Father? Is this real?” Nangong Ping was excited.

Nangong Lin nodded and looked at Su Nantian with a complex expression. He was now curious about what kind of task Su Nantian had done to make Yuan Daying let go of the Nangong Family.

“That’s really great. Then Nantian didn’t return私自, but completed your task. It’s natural for him to return,” Nangong Ping was obviously happy. He had finally obtained such a capable bodyguard, but due to this incident, he was sent away. However, he didn’t think Su Nantian had failed to protect him but rather that his own impulsive actions caused the injury.

Moreover, Nangong Ping understood that it was Zeng Chao who had wanted to get rid of Su Nantian, and since Zeng Chao was his father’s personal bodyguard, he had to give him face. That was why he agreed to let Su Nantian go to Ruohai District.

But now, Su Nantian had accomplished this task and had done a great deed for the Nangong Family. Neither Nangong Lin nor Zeng Chao could punish Su Nantian anymore. Even if they didn’t reward him, it would be a balance of merits and faults. At the very least, he wouldn’t face any punishment.

“Alright, I understand. This time Nantian did well. However, he had already received punishment before, so I won’t reward you. Since he has returned, continue with your previous duties,”

Chapter 546: Borrowing a Bodyguard

Although Nangong Lin said he wouldn’t reward Su Nantian, it was enough for him to return to the Nangong Family and continue his original work.

Hearing this, Nangong Ping was obviously happy. He patted Su Nantian’s shoulder and said, “After returning this time, work well and don’t cause trouble.”

Su Nantian nodded seriously and said to Nangong Ping, “Master, don’t worry. I’ll ensure your safety and won’t let the same thing happen again.”

After saying this, Su Nantian turned to Nangong Lin and said, “Master, don’t worry. I’ll never be so reckless again.”

Nangong Lin nodded and waved to Su Nantian and Nangong Ping, saying, “Alright, I’ve understood. This time you did well. You two go back.”

Hearing Nangong Lin’s words, Nangong Ping led Su Nantian out of Nangong Lin’s villa.

As soon as they left the villa, Nangong Ping immediately said to Su Nantian, “What I just said wasn’t serious. Don’t take it to heart.”

Su Nantian was confused upon hearing Nangong Ping’s words. Had Nangong Ping said anything to him?

So Su Nantian asked with confusion, “Master, what did you say just now?”

“It was… I told you not to make this mistake again. I know my decision was wrong at the time. You had already told me to stay in that room and not come out, but later I was too curious and opened the door before you called me, going out with Wang Meng.”

After saying this, Nangong Ping sighed and continued, “So I was knocked out later because of my own sudden appearance, giving those killers an opportunity. I know this isn’t your fault.”

Su Nantian was surprised upon hearing Nangong Ping’s words, not expecting this纨绔 son of the Nangong Family to speak like that.

But Su Nantian wouldn’t take the bait. He immediately shook his head and said, “This is my fault. After all, I was the security guard, and problems did occur. I have an undeniable responsibility. But Master, don’t worry. From now on, I’ll check thoroughly each time and ensure this doesn’t happen again.

If I had checked the ventilation pipe in that room earlier, or resolved the隐患 earlier, this wouldn’t have happened.”

Nangong Ping nodded. “I understand. But I still want to tell you this isn’t your fault.”

As they spoke, they walked toward Nangong Ping’s villa. But before they reached the door, they saw Nan Gong Yu Yan walking from another direction and heading straight toward them.

“What’s wrong? Is there something?” Nangong Ping asked immediately.

“I need to borrow your bodyguard,” Nan Gong Yu Yan answered.

“Your bodyguard? You already have a bodyguard. Why do you need to borrow mine?” Nangong Ping was confused.

“Zhang Yu hasn’t recovered from his leg injury yet. My remaining bodyguards are just ordinary ones. I need to go to the Wu Family’s inland port tomorrow, so I want you to send Nantian with me to protect my safety.”

After saying this, Nan Gong Yu Yan pointed at Su Nantian beside Nangong Ping and specifically requested that Su Nantian accompany her to the Wu Family’s inland port.

Although Su Nantian didn’t show it, he was secretly excited inside. This was related to the Wu Family, which meant he would have a chance to meet them. If he could meet the Wu Family members, he could find ways through various means to rescue Wu Tao and Wu You’er.

But now, Su Nantian had to maintain a calm exterior. He must not show his inner excitement; otherwise, Nan Gong Yu Yan would surely notice his secret.

“Now that the inland port is under your control,” Nangong Ping said, looking somewhat discontented. But he knew this was decided by Nan Gong Yu Yan during his coma. There was no credit for him in it.

Moreover, Nan Gong Yu Yan had used his injury to gain more benefits for the Nangong Family. So, it was natural that this task was assigned to her. However, this time Nan Gong Yu Yan not only boasted in front of him about going to the Wu Family’s inland port but also specifically requested his bodyguard, which made Nangong Ping even more upset.

“You’re so petty. You don’t want to lend me a bodyguard? Fine, I won’t ask you,” Nan Gong Yu Yan said and turned to leave. This made Su Nantian’s heart anxious, as he had finally gotten this opportunity to get involved in the next contact with the Wu Family but now it was ruined by Nangong Ping.

Su Nantian wished he could run to Nan Gong Yu Yan’s side and tell her he was willing to go with her on this mission.

But just then, Nangong Ping said, “Hey, don’t go yet. I didn’t say no. I just want to know what’s going on? You used my injury as an excuse to get more benefits, so you should let me know if there’s anything wrong.”

Hearing Nangong Ping’s words, Nan Gong Yu Yan immediately turned back. She must have planned this all along, knowing Nangong Ping’s personality would definitely make him give Su Nantian to her. That was why she pretended to leave.

“Right now, I don’t know what’s going on. So far, everything is the same as when we discussed it. Tomorrow is the first time going to the inland port, so I’ll check things out there. Also, I need to send our people ahead to set up camp. But I don’t know if the inland port’s contact will be smooth, since you know Wu Chuan is from the inland port.”

Nan Gong Yu Yan’s words were correct. Although Wu Chuan, as the current leader of the Wu Family, had agreed to give them half of the inland port’s shares, there were still many hidden details in whether it could be smoothly handed over.

Thus, Nan Gong Yu Yan wanted to take Su Nantian with her because she knew his combat skills were exceptional. If there was a tough opponent tomorrow, having Su Nantian would make her feel more secure. If it were just an ordinary bodyguard, she always felt uneasy.

Originally, this task was Zhang Yu’s. But since he hadn’t recovered yet, even if he went it would be useless.

Chapter 547: Misunderstanding

Su Nantian stood by and secretly felt happy. Although he knew going to the inland port might not directly allow him to contact the Wu Family’s inner circle, for him it was already a chance to gradually infiltrate.

“Then tomorrow morning, just come directly. We’ll go together,” Nan Gong Yu Yan said to Su Nantian.

Su Nantian nodded. “I understand, I’ll be there on time.”

Nan Gong Yu Yan nodded and said goodbye to Nangong Ping before returning to her villa.

“Tomorrow will be hard for you. Since she asked you, go with her. Tell her I’m still being told to rest at home and can’t go out, so you just stay with me,” Nangong Ping said after patting Su Nantian’s shoulder, thinking it was a hardship for Su Nantian to accompany Nan Gong Yu Yan.

“Don’t worry, Master. I’m a bodyguard; it’s the same who I follow,” Su Nantian said.

After this small incident, Su Nantian returned to Nangong Ping’s villa and was told to rest. After all, Su Nantian had just returned from Ruohai District and completed such a big task. Moreover, Nangong Ping was currently resting in his room and didn’t need other bodyguards to accompany him. Thus, Su Nantian didn’t have to follow him and could rest in his own room.

However, after Su Nantian returned to his room, he didn’t rest. Instead, he secretly opened a box. He had brought this item back after leaving the Nangong Family. It was a small signal transmitter that could bypass the Nangong Family’s signal detection, so they wouldn’t find out who he was communicating with.

Because Su Nantian had discovered signal detection equipment in the Nangong Family, if he used his phone directly to contact people from the Dark Needle Organization, they could track the information source and possibly expose his identity.

Thus, he had brought this item back during this trip. With this small device, he could simulate a signal isolation, like a disguise that would prevent the signal detection equipment from finding his information.

Then Su Nantian took out another computer and started communicating with the Dark Needle Organization.

Because if he wanted to rescue Wu Tao and Wu You’er from the Wu Family, Su Nantian could not rely solely on himself.

This time he had already roughly understood the internal structure of the Wu Family, as he had carefully memorized every room’s layout and construction while accompanying Wu Chuan in the investigation.

Additionally, he remembered the positions of every removed camera. Once they left, the Wu Family would definitely reinstall these cameras. Thus, if they wanted to enter the Wu Family, they had to avoid them.

Moreover, considering the Wu Family’s current security level, Su Nantian realized it was too small for him to rescue them alone. He needed multiple people to divert attention to achieve the final rescue plan.

At that time, Su Nantian would use his request to get help from the Royal Family. However, Huangzuan could only provide assistance. Thus, he needed to have people from the Dark Needle Organization come over.

“Things are now on track. The Dark Needle Organization, organize your people slightly. I’ll probably need about four people. You continue to stay in Hangcheng,” Su Nantian typed on the screen, clearly addressing Qi Yinzhen.

“Received. I’ll arrange for them to train immediately and ensure they’re in the best condition,” Qi Yinzhen replied quickly.

“By the way, use your means to investigate about the Sea King Gang. See if your organization has any communication with them,” Su Nantian thought, still not wanting to give up on the Sea King Gang.

Because the Sea King Gang was in a special location and was a strong force in the capital, Su Nantian thought if he could use them, it would greatly help him establish a foothold in the capital.

“Understood,” Qi Yinzhen typed again.

“That’s all. Remember, don’t contact me before I reach out to you,” Su Nantian finished and turned off the computer, restoring the room’s signal communication.

Thus, Su Nantian lay on his bed and after thinking for a while fell into a deep sleep. He knew the environment was safe enough for him now, so he could temporarily lower his guard.

Su Nantian didn’t expect to sleep until the next day. When he woke up, it wasn’t yet time for Nan Gong Yu Yan to call him. He slowly washed and had breakfast before heading toward Nan Gong Yu Yan’s villa.

When Su Nantian left Nangong Ping’s villa, Nangong Ping hadn’t woken up yet. So he left quietly. Who would have thought that Wang Meng was on duty today and saw Su Nantian sneaking around, immediately rushing over and asking: “Nantian Brother, what are you doing here? Why are you sneaking around like this? Is there something going on?”

Su Nantian was speechless upon hearing this. He didn’t know whether to commend their vigilance or criticize them for being a reckless head.

“Nothing. I just saw Master hadn’t gotten up yet, so I didn’t want to disturb him. I’m going out early today,” Su Nantian said.

“Going alone? Who are you going with?” Wang Meng continued questioning, like a guard interrogating a suspect.

Su Nantian sighed and said: “The lady next door called me out. Master already knows. Today I’m accompanying her to the Wu Family’s inland port.”

Upon hearing Su Nantian mention the Wu Family, Wang Meng immediately understood and smiled awkwardly, stepping aside to let Su Nantian pass. “Sorry, Nantian Brother. I thought you were going out early to do something secret. So my vigilance was a bit high. Since it’s for an important matter, you go ahead. I apologize.”

Su Nantian knew Wang Meng was overthinking and could only sigh and smile, then left Nangong Ping’s villa toward Nan Gong Yu Yan.

Nan Gong Yu Yan’s villa was close to Nangong Ping’s, so when Su Nantian walked slowly toward it, there were still ten minutes before their scheduled time.

At that moment, Su Nantian saw bodyguards preparing the car at the entrance of Nan Gong Yu Yan’s villa but didn’t see Nan Gong Yu Yan herself.

Chapter 548: Feelings

Nan Gong Yu Yan had clearly already communicated with her bodyguards, so the bodyguard didn’t seem surprised upon seeing Su Nantian and continued with his task.

Thus, Su Nantian stood at the entrance waiting for Nan Gong Yu Yan to come out.

Upon reaching the scheduled time, Su Nantian saw Nan Gong Yu Yan step out of the villa and immediately greeted him: “You’re here. Get in.”

Nan Gong Yu Yan’s bodyguard and driver immediately opened the car door for her. Su Nantian had intended to sit in the front passenger seat, but the bodyguard got in instead. The back of the car was also filled with bodyguards, so Su Nantian realized he could only sit with Nan Gong Yu Yan.

This felt awkward to Su Nantian, as he had always sat in the front passenger seat since joining the Nangong Family. Moreover, Nan Gong Yu Yan was a woman; sitting in the back with her felt strange.

When Su Nantian hesitated, Nan Gong Yu Yan frowned and said: “Get in quickly. Why aren’t you getting in? Don’t waste time.”

Su Nantian nodded and got in.

The car immediately started, heading toward the Wu Family’s inland port.

“Today’s trip might not be smooth. I’ve already told my brother about it, so I called you here to stay in charge. Among my bodyguards at home, your combat skills are the best. So it’s most suitable for you to come. After arriving, watch my reactions and expressions closely. If something is wrong, act decisively,” Nan Gong Yu Yan instructed Su Nantian in the car.

Su Nantian nodded immediately and said: “Miss, don’t worry. I’ll do as you said.”

“Most importantly, watch my expression. I won’t tell you directly what to do, but if something is wrong, you must act immediately,” Nan Gong Yu Yan continued.

“I understand. I’ll follow your cues,” Su Nantian said calmly.

Nan Gong Yu Yan looked up at Su Nantian. She didn’t know why, but when she learned that her father had sent Su Nantian to Ruohai District due to the incident with Nangong Ping, she felt a slight urge to defend him.

At first, she comforted herself by thinking it wasn’t Su Nantian’s fault. But over these few days, she gradually realized something was wrong with her feelings.

She didn’t know why sometimes when she closed her eyes, Su Nantian’s face would flash before her. Or when she went to sleep at night and closed her eyes, it was always Su Nantian. She realized she had developed a different feeling toward him.

But she also knew that if Su Nantian remained a bodyguard, even if he climbed to the position of Zeng Chao, it was impossible for her to develop a romantic relationship with him. Because Nangong Lin would never let his precious daughter marry a bodyguard. Moreover, for Nangong Lin, his daughter was always an option. Even in this modern society, marriage for interests still existed; it wasn’t just a feudal tradition where princesses were sent to marry others in alliances.

This was also why Nangong Lin, despite knowing Nan Gong Yu Yan’s abilities were better than Nangong Ping’s, secretly instructed many people to help Nangong Ping. Because Nan Gong Yu Yan was a daughter’s identity, he thought if the Nangong Family were handed over to her, it would inevitably fall into outsiders’ hands.
