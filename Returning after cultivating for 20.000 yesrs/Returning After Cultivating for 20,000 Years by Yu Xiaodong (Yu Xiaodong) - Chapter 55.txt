Sun Peng's question left Yang Lao Dao speechless, his face turning crimson with embarrassment.

Yet he had no chance to say anything further—Qingying moved like a phantom, slicing through his body and taking his life!

The Qingyang Sect still claimed to be a cultivation sect, but in reality, its members were pitifully weak.

Coupled with the fact that these old monks hadn't fought in ages, and Sun Peng had struck from the shadows, it was no surprise that he wiped out every single elder in an instant!

Outside, Zhang Kun waited for the sect leader's orders. Unexpectedly, he heard a cacophony of screams from inside and immediately turned to flee.

But his legs could never match the speed of a flying sword!

Qingying pierced him to the ground in one strike.

"Senior Brother... please spare my life!"

"Pu, what did you say? I didn't catch it."

Sun Peng, now fully consumed by his sword's madness, radiated a thick aura of bloodshed as he stepped out of the sword pavilion. Qingying trembled slightly before returning to his waist sheath.

He turned, gazing at the corpses scattered across the pavilion. Sun Peng felt an indescribable emotion—perhaps a touch of sorrow.

By the time the disciples discovered their elders' bodies, Sun Peng had vanished long ago.

This incident even caught the attention of National Security Group Six, making Sun Peng a topic of conversation among all circles.

Zhu Jie and Li Zhan stood at the bloodstained entrance of the sword pavilion, their brows furrowed. The scene was too gory for them to stomach.

"Master Swordsmen! Again, master swordsmen!"

"Didn't they say that the sword sect's lineage was lost a hundred years ago? Why have so many of them suddenly appeared?"

"Zhu Jie, do you think Sun Peng is the mysterious figure who helped Su Nantian in the western suburbs of Fengcheng?"

According to reliable information, Su Nantian had destroyed the Wu family in Hezhou while Sun Peng was present. Moreover, they hadn't clashed but had conversed amicably!

After hearing Li Zhan's words, Zhu Jie furrowed his brows. He was considering the possibility—was that mysterious figure truly Sun Peng?

To be honest, it was quite plausible. The residual aura at the scene confirmed that the mysterious figure was extremely powerful.

Although Sun Peng's cultivation level wasn't high, he possessed the ability to command a flying sword.

Though the Qingyang Sect had declined, its elders and sect leader still held some strength. Their sword techniques were masterful, and with magical enhancements, they could inflict various types of damage—undoubtedly formidable.

Yet Sun Peng had single-handedly wiped out the entire Qingyang Sect's elders, pushing it to the brink of collapse.

The sect, which had endured for millennia, might be reduced to ashes in an instant. His strength was undeniable and no longer questionable.

"But the investigation results show that Sun Peng and Su Nantian only met at the Wu family, right?"

The more he thought about it, the more plausible it seemed. Yet Zhu Jie still voiced his doubt—the only unresolved issue.

"So what? If Sun Peng is indeed the mysterious figure from Fengcheng, it means he and Su Nantian had known each other long before.

That easily explains why they got along so well at the Wu family."

Hearing Li Zhan's words, Zhu Jie glanced at him with surprise. He hadn't expected this blunt-minded fellow to display such meticulous thinking.

"Hey, why are you staring at me like that? Your eyes are weird."

Li Zhan felt awkward under Zhu Jie's gaze, flashing a simple smile.

Zhu Jie had always thought Li Zhan was naive, but now he realized he was the real fool. Anyone who considered this man naive would surely suffer a loss.

This guy was a classic case of "great wisdom appearing foolish." Though he didn't seem to think much, it didn't mean he was stupid. Beneath his naive exterior lurked a mind full of mischief—no one could match him.

The two had just arrived from Fengcheng and spent half a day here, inspecting the corpses on Qingyang Mountain. There were no clues.

The residual aura was completely different from that at Fengcheng's western suburbs, but after Li Zhan's analysis, Zhu Jie still believed Sun Peng was the mysterious figure.

If that were true...

"Where could Sun Peng go now after committing such a crime at Qingyang Sect?"

Zhu Jie already had an answer in mind but wanted Li Zhan's approval, so he asked.

"Hey, how can you ask me that? I'm not him."

Li Zhan maintained his naive expression, pretending to be a brute who didn't think much. Yet I still said:

"The Qingyang Sect's inheritance is known to us both—it doesn't include the art of flying swords.

Therefore, Sun Peng's ability must have come from Su Nantian. Currently, only Su Nantian possesses such a secret technique!

Now that he's killed the entire Qingyang Sect, he's like a stray dog with nowhere to run.

If I were Sun Peng, I'd definitely go to Fengcheng and seek refuge with Su Nantian."

Whether Li Zhan's words were intentional or not, Zhu Jie's eyes lit up. He had thought the same thing. Now it seemed they were in agreement, making the probability much higher.

"Let's go back to Fengcheng!"

They had just arrived from Fengcheng, but now Zhu Jie and Li Zhan rushed back to Fengcheng.

In their view, Sun Peng was now truly desperate. Since he had a close relationship with Su Nantian, it was certain he'd come to seek refuge.

Although Zhu Jie and Li Zhan's various speculations were all baseless, the result was the same—Sun Peng had indeed arrived in Fengcheng.

It was truly a case of "a blind cat catching a dead mouse!"

Chapter 263: Zhang An

Su Nantian gazed at the man before him, unable to believe it. It had only been a few days since they last met, yet this man looked so destitute and battered.

When he first met Sun Peng at the Wu family in Hezhou, he had been a modest gentleman. Holding a long sword, wearing a flowing robe, his long hair flowed like it had stepped out of an ancient drama.

But now he was completely different. His flowing robe had been replaced with a ragged, tattered outfit from some unknown source, covered in dirt.

His long hair had been cut short, leaving it uneven and messy like a dog's chewed fur.

His eyes were lifeless, his beard unshaven. If it weren't for the spiritual Qingying Sword he still carried, Su Nantian would have doubted if this was the same Sun Peng.

After washing and changing into clean clothes, and tidying his beard and hair, he finally looked like a person.

He sipped some tea quietly, his face showing an ageless weariness.

With a calm and emotionless tone, he recounted the events he had experienced.

The story left Su Nantian stunned.

"Two thousand years of cultivation and the path to immortality, returning to the mundane world without becoming immortal. Deceit and betrayal abound like bamboo shoots in spring, defying fate with inevitable consequences..."

Cultivators were naturally like this—resources were limited, and all things competed. In the cultivation world, fighting over resources and even betraying fellow disciples was common.

But for a simple sword that couldn't even be called a flying sword, to cause such a commotion—Su Nantian had never seen it before. It was truly astonishing.

Moreover, what surprised him even more was that this man was truly ruthless.

One person and one sword had wiped out an entire sect! Such behavior was rare even in the cultivation world.

Yet one thing intrigued Su Nantian—those who had destroyed their own sects often became powerful villains later.

Could Sun Peng have such potential?

Saying more was just a joke. Su Nantian had no words of comfort for Sun Peng's experience.

Now that the Qingyang Sect was destroyed, and since Sun Peng had come to seek refuge with him, Su Nantian agreed and assigned him a task.

Nothing major—Su Nantian taught Sun Peng some basic flying sword techniques and also imparted him with the skills of forging flying swords and formations.

At this moment, Qingying was still far from being a true flying sword. It could only be controlled within thirty to fifty meters, its light not sharp enough to change size at will.

It was still far from the true flying swords that could reach the clouds above or descend into the depths of hell.

Not to mention the basic requirements—such as a single white ribbon flying out, cutting off someone's head from a thousand miles away.

Su Nantian had Sun Peng stay here, teaching him the methods of forging flying swords and some sword techniques. Then he sent him to Zhang Xiaojun.

During this time, Zhang Xiaojun had apparently learned some skills from somewhere and opened a small barbecue stall near the school. It was said that the food was delicious, and business was booming. Su Nantian had even eaten there a few times.

It had become somewhat famous on campus, with people coming in droves every day.

Originally, they were short of staff and planned to hire a helper. Fortunately, Sun Peng arrived, so the two could keep each other company.

Moreover, Zhang Xiaojun had started practicing the cultivation techniques Su Nantian had given him. Surprisingly, his talent was quite good—within a few days he had already entered the basics. Though he hadn't achieved any real cultivation, he was much better than those who couldn't even enter the door.

It was perfect to send Sun Peng there to guide him in his cultivation shortcomings—useless but effective.

Zhang Xiaojun practiced boxing, a small sect's cultivation technique Su Nantian had obtained. It wasn't a body-building path, but it could still strengthen the body.

Though it was nothing special in the cultivation world, it was sufficient for Earth.

Meanwhile, Zhu Jie and Li Zhan had just returned to Fengcheng when they received a call.

"Hey, Old Zhang, it's so late at night—why are you calling us?"

After answering the call, Li Zhan was curious about why Old Zhang—known for his violent temper—would call.

In National Security Group Six, Old Zhang's cultivation was among the core forces, at the peak of refining qi and about to break through into innate.

He usually stayed in Beijing, rarely coming out—making him one of the group's notorious hot-headed guys.

"Wasn't it you two who called me? You said my sister ran off with some strange man. Did you see what kind of person that kid was? If he wants to marry my Zhang An's sister, he'll have to measure his strength."

"..."

No wonder Old Zhang was hot-headed—his words carried weight.

What else could they say? They drove to the train station and met Zhang An.

He was a tall man, over two meters in height, his muscles bulging like a human beast. If one had to describe him, it would be something like a larger version of Longhu Yan.

After seeing Zhang An's appearance, everyone could understand why Zhang Xiaoya liked Longhu Yan.

Growing up with such a guy as an older brother, her taste must have been different from ordinary people.

Seeing Zhang An, Li Zhan felt a bit scared. Though he was also a body-building cultivator and considered a hot-headed guy by others, compared to Zhang An he was just a small fry.

In short, Longhu Yan, Li Zhan, and Zhang An were like three copies from the same mold.

Longhu Yan was a small version, Li Zhan medium, and Zhang An large—clearly divided.

They found a place to welcome Zhang An back, but as they drove, they ended up returning to the area near the school.

After all, Zhu Jie and Li Zhan had been monitoring Su Nantian for a while, so the most familiar place was near the school. And it had to be said that the food at the school's nearby stalls was really good.

Especially a new barbecue place—ah, in such hot weather, grilled meat with icy beer was the perfect combination.

When they arrived at the place in the evening, around five or six o'clock, it was peak time for students.

After struggling to find an empty seat, they sat waiting for Zhang Xiaojun to bring the food.

Zhang An surveyed the slightly modest barbecue stall, and his gaze fell on the owner grilling skewers and the helper arranging them. His eyes narrowed slightly.

"What's going on?"

His voice was soft, but it echoed in Zhu Jie's ear.

Chapter 264: Convergence of Both Sides

Zhu Jie knew he was referring to Zhang Xiaojun and Sun Peng. In the common world, cultivators were legendary figures, but in reality, they weren't that numerous.

Now this small barbecue stall had two of them—Sun Peng was even at the level of refining qi seven, a minor expert.

It naturally made Zhang An shocked—two cultivators gathering in such a modest stall had made it mysterious.

Originally, Zhu Jie and Li Zhan were looking for Sun Peng everywhere, but now he had appeared before them.

At first, they were both shocked, thinking Sun Peng might have another scheme.

After all, in their view, Sun Peng had slaughtered his own sect and wiped out all the elders with bloodstained ground. The scene was extremely bloody and cruel!

He was truly a bloodthirsty and ruthless person.

This kind of cultivator was usually on the wrong path, using souls and blood for sacrifices or to refine evil techniques.

They were a key target of National Security Group Six, and no tolerance was allowed.

If it weren't for their lack of confidence in capturing Su Nantian, they might have already acted.

After all, Zhu Jie and Li Zhan didn't know what Qingyang Sect planned to do with Sun Peng. Though the sect was still under national control, some parts were outside of it.

Many internal matters of the sects weren't interfered with by the state until a major incident occurred, like now when Sun Peng had wiped out Qingyang Sect.

The state only learned about it too late, most of the damage already done.

These days, they had been looking for an opportunity to act, but found that Sun Peng was actually quite obedient. He didn't leave, just sold skewers and practiced at home every day.

There was no real opportunity, and since it was a busy area, they couldn't fight openly in front of the public.

Hence, they had been waiting for Zhang An to arrive.

With Zhang An's absolute strength as a guarantee, Zhu Jie and Li Zhan felt more at ease.

After seeing the bloody and cruel scene of Qingyang Sect, they truly weren't confident in facing the flying sword's blade.

After briefly explaining Sun Peng's situation to Zhang An, his gaze changed—eyes wide with anger.

Unlike Li Zhan's small intelligence, Zhang An was hot-tempered and easily angered. In his view, any issue could be solved with fists; if not, it was because the fists weren't big enough.

It was actually quite reasonable.

At that moment, if it weren't for Zhu Jie and Li Zhan holding him back, Zhang An might have already punched.

The two felt a bit helpless and smiled awkwardly—was it good or bad to have told him?

After much persuasion, they finally calmed Zhang An down and promised them that they would act when the opportunity came.

This trip to Fengcheng was mainly to see their sister, but there were also such incidents. Zhang An was a martial arts enthusiast; with a fight to fight, his mood was naturally good and his appetite increased.

Although these skewers were made by Zhang Xiaojun and Sun Peng, who he considered villains, the taste was good. It didn't matter who made it.

Zhang An enjoyed his meal, and he and Li Zhan each had a bottle of ergu. They didn't use cups but drank directly.

Zhu Jie was much more polite and didn't drink alcohol.

Just as these guys were getting a bit high, the curtain was suddenly lifted, and another group entered.

Although the newcomers looked no different from ordinary people, Zhu Jie immediately noticed something was off.

The newcomers were all his acquaintances.

Leading them was Su Nantian, at the level of refining qi eight, holding a flying sword that could be terrifying.

Behind him were Longhu Yan and Zhang Xiaoya—Longhu Yan at refining qi six, Zhang Xiaoya at refining qi three. They were all figures in the circle.

Moreover, he knew Zhang Xiaoya—she was Zhang An's own sister.

Plus the barbecue owner Zhang Xiaojun and Sun Peng outside, without realizing it, Zhu Jie felt shocked. Around Su Nantian had gathered so many cultivators—this was an unstoppable force.

There was also the mysterious figure who had never shown up, leaving an aura in the western suburbs. Zhu Jie speculated that this mysterious figure's strength would not be weaker than Su Nantian, perhaps even stronger.

After calculating the enemy's combat power, Zhu Jie felt a bit scared.

Not that he was afraid of death, but suddenly realizing the final combat power was terrifying—much stronger than the National Security Group Six's stationed unit in Fengcheng.

The entire city of Fengcheng had only one observer from National Security Group Six.

Compared to the vast territory of China, now in this era of decline, there weren't many cultivators for them to command.

Zhang An and Li Zhan were drinking heavily, playing rock-paper-scissors, their voices loud and chaotic, causing many people around to glare at them.

But these two didn't care about others' opinions, and as they were both strong men, some students at the barbecue place didn't dare to say much. This indirectly affected Zhang Xiaojun and Sun Peng's business.

Zhang Xiaojun and Zhang Xiaoya were happy to have some peace, it wasn't a big deal.

Su Nantian and his group entered, but they didn't notice. However, Tian Lan saw them and was surprised why these people were here, but he didn't think much.

As for Li Zhan and Zhu Jie, he naturally knew them—last time they had approached him, claiming to be from the National Security Department. The name was too long for Su Nantian to remember, but he didn't care.

He was more interested in the other big version of Li Zhan, who looked like he was also on the body-building path.

His strength was high and his figure massive, giving Su Nantian a sense of oppression.

Although he could tell this person hadn't yet broken through to the innate level, at least he was at the peak of refining qi.

Seeing this person, Su Nantian felt relieved—relieved that he had re-forged Fuyun Sword a few days ago, otherwise he might have been defeated.

Of course, he himself didn't like fighting and killing; if it could be avoided, he preferred not to.

The group didn't bother with these two and found an empty table to sit.

After a while, Zhang Xiaojun had already brought out the grilled skewers and marinated pork hearts and trotters, filling the small space with rich aroma.

Chapter 265: The Iron Throne Reappears

"Boss!"

It seemed he had smelled the scent. Zhang An swayed unsteadily, his eyes bloodshot, and asked Zhang Xiaojun:

"Kid, why didn't we get the trotters on that table? Bring them over quickly. I won't miss out on the money."

Zhang Xiaojun was startled by Zhang An's words and immediately explained: "Sir, sorry for the misunderstanding. Those trotters and pork hearts are for us to eat, not for sale.

The quantity is really limited, and what's on that table is all we have.

These are my friends, so I took them out to entertain them. Look at this..."

Before Zhang Xiaojun could finish, Zhang An's big palm had already pressed onto his shoulder, the immense power causing him to stagger.

Fortunately, Zhang Xiaojun had been diligently practicing Su Nantian's techniques for a while. Though it wasn't the body-building methods of Zhang An and Li Zhan, it was still focused on strengthening the physical body.

After some time of practice, he had grasped a few techniques and his body was stronger now. Otherwise, this slap would have knocked him to the ground.

"Little boss, that's your mistake. They are your friends, but can't I be your friend too?

Those pork hearts and trotters they can eat, why can't I?"

What could Zhang Xiaojun say? He could only smile awkwardly. He arranged Zhang An back to his seat and told Su Nantian's group, taking a small portion of the pork trotters and hearts to give to Zhang An.

It had to be said that Zhang Xiaojun's marinated pork trotters and hearts were really delicious. No need for anyone to tear them open, Zhang An directly grabbed and devoured them.

After eating most of it, he remembered that they had taken it from another table. So he grabbed a half-bottle of ergu, swayed unsteadily toward Su Nantian's table.

Zhang An wobbled over to Su Nantian's table and placed the bottle of ergu on it.

"Today, I thank you all for letting me eat these trotters. I've made friends with you.

We're all straightforward people, so if there's anything you can't settle in the Fengcheng area, just mention my name Zhang An."

Su Nantian and others were surprised. This big man had gotten drunk and still remembered to thank them, so they felt a bit of goodwill. But before they could speak, Zhang An's eyes lit up and he stared intently at the only girl on the table.

"Little girl, lift your head and let me take a good look!"

Since entering the restaurant, Zhang Xiaoya had been hiding behind Longhu Yan, not lifting her head and eating silently without much presence.

But now she had been noticed by this big man.

Her wife being flirted with, Longhu Yan's face wasn't good. He was about to stand up and hit the table but was stopped by Zhang Xiaoya gently.

He stood up first!

"Smack!"

"Smack!"

Zhang Xiaoya suddenly smacked the table, startling everyone. Especially Zhang An, who was dazed and sobered up a bit. He looked at the angry Zhang Xiaoya with hesitation:

"Hey, little sister, what's wrong? You're so angry. I was just joking!"

Seeing Zhang An still making verbal advantages at this moment, Longhu Yan was really angry.

"You who are my brother? You want to die!"

One sentence, just as he said it, was pulled back by Zhang Xiaoya.

"Shh, don't talk nonsense. He's my brother, my real brother."

"Uh..."

The scene was awkward.

A large table with Zhu Jie, Li Zhan, and Zhang An sitting across from Su Nantian leading Zhang Xiaoya, Longhu Yan, Sun Peng, and Zhang Xiaojun.

Neither side spoke, the atmosphere became strange.

Finally, in this awkward atmosphere, Zhang An felt uneasy and was the first to speak to Zhang Xiaoya:

"I say little sister, what's your thinking?

You had a good arranged marriage with Liu Dasha at home. Why did you choose to run away and come here? And found such a man, are you really not afraid your father will be angry?"

Hearing Zhang An mention their father, Zhang Xiaoya sneered and rolled her eyes. Obviously, she didn't regard her father as anything.

As the only girl in the Zhang family, there were her grandfather and three uncles and seven or eight cousins. In the Zhang family, Zhang Xiaoya was definitely a beloved daughter!

If her father really said something about her, although it's not good to say so, her grandfather would break his father's legs.

In such a family full of indulgence, Zhang Xiaoya had grown up to be so open and kind—this was truly difficult.

Seeing the girl's reaction, Zhang An knew his father had no real authority. But he still scolded her:

"Little sister, even if you were promised to Liu Dasha, this thing your father did was wrong.

But you can't blame your mother. Your mother has been crying all the time, her eyes are swollen.

You're so heartless, not even going back to see your mother?"

Seeing his threat didn't work, Zhang An switched to emotional appeal. Indeed, compared to his father's threat, reminding her of her mother was more effective in moving Zhang Xiaoya.

"What about your father?"

Although she wasn't afraid of her own father, he was still her real father. Zhang Xiaoya was a bit conflicted and asked.

"Your father is getting married."

"Huh?"

Everyone who had been listening to their conversation was stunned, dropping the melon they were holding!

"Your father is getting married!" Who can tell me what this operation is?

Not only the others, but Zhang Xiaoya was also confused.

Seeing everyone's reaction, Zhang An explained:

"Since you ran away from home, it angered the old man. The old man said, since this marriage was your father's promise, then let your father marry Liu Dasha..."

"…"

Zhang Xiaoya had nothing to say, her forehead was full of black lines.

Hearing Zhang An's words, others almost burst out laughing. This Zhang family was really amazing! What kind of people were they? The old man, the father, why did Su Nantian always feel like there was no one reliable, each one more powerful than the other!

Others were okay, but Su Nantian's laugh was low and he really couldn't hold back.

"Ha!"

A light sound, he couldn't help but laugh out loud.

To be honest, laughing out loud was rude, but others didn't dare to do it. Their mouths were tightly clenched, and they couldn't help but twitch, yet they didn't dare to move.

In an instant, Zhang An's face changed, and he was like a beast awakening, the atmosphere changing!

A fierce aura emerged from his body, reminding Su Nantian that this man was truly a bloodthirsty killer.

With his palm, he slapped down toward Su Nantian.

"Little bastard, today I'll teach you a lesson in being a person! Some people aren't worthy of your laughter, and they don't have the qualifications."

Hearing Zhang An's words, Su Nantian's face turned cold. He waved his hand and a black shadow flew out, colliding with Zhang An's palm.

"Crack!"

A light sound was heard by everyone present, clearly the sound of bones breaking.

Fortunately, it was already late and past school closing time. So only the two opposing sides and a school's physical education teacher were in the store.

But that unfortunate person had been thrown a cup by Longhu Yan at the start of the battle, knocking him out.

Zhang An had only intended to teach Su Nantian a lesson, but he never thought something could break his bones!

After all, Zhang An was at the peak of refining qi, with a body like copper and iron, his bones were heavier than gold!

Yet he hadn't expected to accidentally fall into this trap.

He was knocked back two steps, his eyes like two big lights, staring intently at Su Nantian.

Su Nantian didn't move at all. The black shadow returned to his back, instantly expanding into an iron throne.

Dark flames rose, with skeletons underfoot, dark clouds constantly rolling, supporting the iron throne suspended in midair.

On the back of the throne stood a raven, its two red eyes glowing with bloodlight, staring at Zhang An as if it were looking at a delicacy.

He lifted his foot and stepped onto the throne, gently sitting on it. Su Nantian scratched his ear and asked Zhang An:

"What did you call me just now?"

Seeing the appearance of this throne, Zhang An was stunned.

"A spiritual artifact?"

He couldn't believe it—Su Nantian had such a spiritual artifact in his hands!

After all, in the current cultivation world, spiritual artifacts were legendary. Only top-level cultivation families or sects had ancestral heirlooms passed down, and they were rarely used.

Zhang An hadn't expected to be so lucky—hitting someone randomly and finding a spiritual artifact.

He knew that in front of the spirit, he would be at a disadvantage. The previous fight had shown that his fists hit this spiritual artifact as if hitting a mountain of iron.

His copper and iron fists had broken three fingers! Although his physical condition allowed him to recover instantly, he knew he was at a disadvantage with this person.

"So what? The Zhang family never fears!"

Shouting, Zhang An rushed forward again, determined to fight the iron throne with his fists.

Perhaps because Su Nantian's appearance was so majestic, it had unintentionally made Zhang An feel that he was strong.

In fact, Su Nantian's cultivation level was slightly lower than his. This throne wasn't a powerful spiritual artifact, only having one layer of the flying array to keep it suspended.

Although the entire throne was made of xuan iron, for Earth's cultivators, it was truly luxurious.

But essentially, this thing had no many functions. Even the previous expansion and contraction was done by Su Nantian himself with hand signs.

The reason it had injured Zhang An slightly was mainly because the xuan iron was so heavy, and it was just a hard hit.

If he had dodged, there would have been no problem.

But Su Nantian had calculated his temper well—Zhang An was not the type to dodge!

"Big brother!"

Seeing Zhang An rush forward again, Su Nantian pointed his finger forward. A flying sword had already silently hovered beside him.

It was Fuyun!

The obstacle pointed at by the sword's tip felt a gust of wind cutting around his body. Although he relied on his thick skin and strong flesh, he could withstand one more hit, but the feeling was definitely not pleasant!

Looking at this flying sword hovering there without any aura, seemingly just a shadow.

Zhang An knew he couldn't withstand it with his body.

His angry expression turned calm, revealing a serious one. He reached into the backpack behind him and pulled out two boxing gloves!

Rough and old, looking worn and battered. Some black stains were on them, as if dried blood.

Although these boxing gloves looked unimpressive, when Zhang An took them out, the whole store suddenly had a fierce wind and bloodlight.

Facing these boxing gloves, Su Nantian's expression, which had been indifferent, gradually faded. He hadn't expected that on this small Earth there would be such things!

War weapons!

War weapons were not magical artifacts made by cultivators. They were weapons that had experienced countless battles and been tempered with blood.

Although they didn't have as many miraculous abilities as magical artifacts, their instinct was to be fierce and bloodthirsty.

In the cultivation world, some people used war weapons formed by battle to refine evil artifacts with blood and soul. Their power was great, but they violated the natural order, known as forbidden techniques.

Su Nantian truly hadn't expected that on this small Earth there would be war weapons, and they were even a complete set with Zhang An.

This battle was no longer easy—Su Nantian had to take it seriously!

The atmosphere between both sides became increasingly tense. Zhang Xiaoya nervously shouted, but it was of no use.

"Are you going to fight here?"

Hearing this, both men were startled. After all, if they really fought with full power, it would be hard to control the situation, especially since this was a busy area.

"Hmph! You little bastard, I remember you!"

Zhang An sneered and sat back down, no longer looking at this side. Su Nantian also收回 the flying sword and throne. The strange atmosphere returned to reality.

But the conversation between both sides was unavoidable!

"Zhu Jie, what's this kid's background? He has two spiritual artifacts on him, one of which is a flying sword. It's really unexpected.

If we fight, I don't have much confidence."

Zhang An looked like a rough man with a hot temper, but when it came to real matters, he wasn't an idiot. He knew if he couldn't win, he would prepare early.

"This is the Su Nantian I mentioned to you. The incident in Fengcheng's western suburbs was done by him! And besides him, the barbecue helper also has a flying sword."

Chapter 267: Hot Blood 3v3 (Part One)

Hearing Zhu Jie's words, Zhang An frowned slightly. What was this world coming to? They said flying swords were lost, but now even a random person had one!
