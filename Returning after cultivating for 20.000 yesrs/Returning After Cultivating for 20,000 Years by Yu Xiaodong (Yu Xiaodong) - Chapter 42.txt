Su Nantian was about to refuse when he thought of the five volleyball players behind him. His lips curled slightly as he said, "Then you don't mind me bringing these five volleyball players from our class?"

Cao Yun's face paled as she glanced at the five men behind Su Nantian. A sense of impending loss gripped her heart. To say she minded would be truthful—she had invited Su Nantian to dinner specifically to get closer to him. Yet at this moment, if she said she didn't mind, it would be the proper thing for a class monitor to do. After all, as the class monitor, she should make sacrifices for the class.

Cao Yun mused internally before quickly adopting a shy expression and saying, "Of course not. I said inviting Su to dinner was to thank him for healing my ankle injury. Now these five classmates and you will be fighting for our class this afternoon. I hope you don't mind me treating you to a good meal."

The five men blushed, surprised that merely being near Su Nantian had earned them a meal from the class beauty. They quickly waved their hands.

"No, no!"
"How could we?"
"Thank you so much!"

Cao Yun smiled at them in return, saying, "Let's go then. You have a match this afternoon and need to save your energy. Eat well at noon."

With that, Cao Yun turned and walked ahead as if leading the way. Her mind, however, was troubled: What place should I take them to? A fancy spot is out of the question... Ah!

Cao Yun suddenly brightened, her steps becoming light.

Su Nantian silently followed at the back of the group, his eyes catching all the subtle calculations.

Under Cao Yun's guidance, they exited the school gate and headed into a secluded alley. After crossing it, they arrived at an ordinary street.

"Here!" Cao Yun pointed to a modest roadside restaurant ahead, saying, "This is it. I often come here; the food's great. Eat well later." She turned to glance at the restaurant sign, secretly pleased: "The best part is it's affordable!"

The five boys, upon seeing the roadside restaurant, showed visible disdain. They knew Cao Yun's family held high positions and had ample funds. They'd expected to be taken somewhere with class, but instead found themselves at a roadside eatery.

"Hey, Cao Yun, is this really the place?" Gao Zhi said unhappily. "This doesn't match your image as class beauty."
"Hey, I thought it was a fancy restaurant too," Gao Zhi added.

Chapter 197: Reencounter

Though Su Nantian felt it was awkward to say such things to a girl who had invited him, he knew Cao Yun well. She appeared gentle and reasonable on the surface but would never let anyone take advantage of her. Thus, Su Nantian chose silence.

As expected, Cao Yun retaliated. She frowned at them, her gaze carrying a hint of reproach: "The food here is made with the chef's heartfelt care. The taste and quality are better than other places."

"I invited you here because I appreciate your efforts for the class. This place is one I often visit, and it's a treasure in my eyes."

"How can you judge a restaurant by its appearance? Do you think I intentionally brought you here?" Cao Yun's near-tears performance made the Gao brothers panic.

"No, no! We just spoke without thinking," they stammered.
"Right, it's our fault. We shouldn't have said that. Please don't be upset!"

Cao Yun said nothing but lowered her head as if suppressing something, sniffing quietly. After a moment, under the Gao brothers' worried glances, she finally lifted her head and forced a smile: "Fine, I accept your apology. Let's go eat now."

The Gao brothers exchanged a glance and sighed in relief.

Su Nantian, trailing at the end of the group, had witnessed the entire scene and found Cao Yun's performance masterful.

That brief incident was quickly forgotten, and Cao Yun returned to her usual graceful demeanor. The five boys dared not discuss the restaurant's merits again, merely lowering their heads and following Cao Yun.

Cao Yun, after the ordeal, felt unusually cheerful as she walked into the restaurant.

The place was a typical roadside eatery with two glass doors slightly ajar, one open and the other half-closed. Damaged areas were patched with layers of tape.

Su Nantian wasn't picky; he'd endured or seen harsher environments. But the five affluent students from Fengyue University found it hard to stomach. He Tao even imagined if the place sold human meat buns, shuddering at the thought and hesitating to enter.

To compensate for offending Cao Yun, Gao Zhi grabbed He Tao's collar and hauled him inside.

Upon entering, Cao Yun's eyes darted around searching for something. Su Nantian was drawn to the large menu on the wall, pausing to examine each dish.

The names were evocative, and the prices reasonable—Cao Yun's choice had merit.

As Su Nantian was engrossed in the menu, Cao Yun found her target. She weaved through the crowd to a table with leftover dishes, where a girl in an apron was clearing plates for six people.

Cao Yun patted the girl's shoulder, startling her into a shudder that nearly spilled the soup. After steadying it, the girl turned to scold but froze upon seeing Cao Yun.

"You're here?"
Cao Yun, embarrassed by her own boldness, also started. "I brought friends to eat here today."
"That's great! You're giving me support!" The girl placed the soup back on the table and called out to the kitchen: "Liu, come help! I have something to do!"

A man's deep voice responded from the kitchen. The girl relaxed, set down her cloth, and folded her apron.

Cao Yun smiled: "Alright, arrange a private room for us. Are there any vacancies upstairs?"
"Yes," the girl replied, guiding Cao Yun away from the crowd toward the entrance.

Cao Yun and the girl stood together, their harmony striking. Except for Su Nantian studying the menu, the other five were stunned by the girl's ethereal beauty.

"Wow, such a small eatery hides talent! There's even this pretty girl," He Tao said, his earlier fear replaced by a flirtatious demeanor.
"Cut it out," Gao An patted He Tao's shoulder. "How old are you? She's probably still in high school."
Zhao Ling nodded politely: "Yes, I'm currently in high school." She glanced at the five's uniforms and added, "You're all students from Fengyue University like Cao Yun."

This earned nods of pride. Song Jin said, "That's right. Only Fengyue University produces so many talents."

The group laughed heartily.
"My college entrance exam志愿 will also be Fengyue University. We'll meet there," Zhao Ling said, her admiration for Fengyue University evident. It was this support that had driven her to excel in high school.

The five felt pride, and Gao Zhi, wanting to encourage Zhao Ling, reached out but hesitated—her small frame might break. So he stealthily withdrew his hand, amusing He Tao.
"Your hands are already eager," He Tao teased.
Gao Zhi blushed, though it wasn't true. Yet being caught made him feel exposed: "Forget it, stop talking nonsense. I was trying to encourage her but thought it inappropriate and took it back."
Zhao Ling simply smiled, unconcerned. "Alright, gentlemen, today you're doing me a favor. I'll arrange a private room for you now. Please check the menu at the front."

Chapter 198: Surprise

Zhao Ling led everyone to examine the large menu on the wall. The five and Cao Yun gathered around the front desk. Zhao Ling smiled at Cao Yun, releasing her hand.

The counter was traditionally wooden, forming a circle with only one board serving as a door.
Zhao Ling approached and opened the counter, her small figure slipping through. Su Nantian had paused at the entrance to study the menu.

When Zhao Ling slipped inside, she looked up and saw Su Nantian studying the menu intently. She was startled but soon smiled.

That night's chance encounter at the convenience store had lingered in Zhao Ling's mind. Initially, she thought Su Nantian was perverted and chose the most revealing underwear for him. But she hadn't expected Su Nantian to take the bag without a glance.

If Zhao Ling's assumption was correct, Su Nantian would never have taken the bag without looking.

She had watched him pay and thank her, still surprised by his actions.
That night, Zhao Ling lay under the covers, self-reproaching all evening. Even in her dreams, she saw Su Nantian and his girlfriend arguing over the underwear.

Meeting Su Nantian again was a joy for Zhao Ling. She studied his handsome face, her heart racing and cheeks flushing: "Good, he hasn't been beaten by his girlfriend."

But thinking of this, Zhao Ling's previous shyness turned into a slight resentment.

Gao An and the other four boys were loudly discussing the menu. Su Nantian, having finished reading, turned his gaze to the bustling crowd and saw Zhao Ling. He was startled.

"Good luck, meeting again." Zhao Ling met Su Nantian's gaze without retreating. "Do you have any dishes in mind?"
Su Nantian blinked, then shook his head: "I've read it all. I don't know which dishes are good. By the way, thank you for last night."

The group's loud conversation was stunned by Zhao Ling and Su Nantian's exchange. Song Jin pushed aside the Gao brothers to ask Su Nantian: "You two know each other?!"
Su Nantian glanced at Zhao Ling and nodded: "We do."
He Tao was surprised, then sighed: "You even target little girls!"
The Gao brothers laughed and slapped He Tao, who stumbled.
Cao Yun's surprised expression stiffened. Her eyes flicked between Zhao Ling and Su Nantian before she bit her lips, holding back what she wanted to say.

Zhao Ling quickly deflected with a smile: "What are you all talking about? It's annoying."
She patted the menu behind her: "Go ahead and order. Then go to the second-floor hall."

At that moment, Song Jin wasn't interested in ordering. He rushed to the counter's edge and earnestly asked Zhao Ling: "How did you two meet? Tell us, okay?"
Zhao Ling had worked at this eatery since childhood, prioritizing its business.

"Want a story? First order the dishes, then I'll tell you in the private room." Zhao Ling patted the menu again.
Cao Yun stepped in to help Zhao Ling: "Yes, let's stop crowding here. It's disturbing others."

Though many people came to eat, most were seated at tables looking at the menu.
Everyone understood Cao Yun was giving them a way out and nodded, ordering dishes they wanted.

The eatery's food quality was unknown to them, but the affordable prices made them order without hesitation.
Yet this upset Su Nantian: "Order what you can eat."

The five boys were taken aback by his words and quickly told Zhao Ling: "Actually, I don't want the Beijing sauce pork."
"Only one roast duck, please."
"No need for sea bass; I can't eat so much."

Zhao Ling cast Su Nantian a grateful glance. She hated those who wasted food, especially when they couldn't finish and didn't take leftovers.
But she hadn't expected Su Nantian to be thrifty, making her regard him even more. Her small joy was evident.

Su Nantian's response to Zhao Ling's gratitude was a "whatever" glance.
"I didn't expect you to be not only physically strong but also morally upright. It's truly embarrassing for us." Cao Yun smiled, standing beside Su Nantian. Her eyes flicked to Zhao Ling inside the counter before saying: "Su Nantian, you don't know that Zhao Ling is very against waste. We were excited and ordered so much food. If it weren't for your reminder, we might have wasted it."

Su Nantian subtly stepped forward, creating a slight distance from Cao Yun.
The five boys, upon hearing Cao Yun's explanation, sighed in relief.
"Thank goodness Su Nantian was here; otherwise, we'd have annoyed Zhao Ling."
"By the way, your name is Zhao Ling?" He Tao leaned over the counter and asked: "Your name really fits you—so full of spirit."
Zhao Ling blinked her spirited eyes and smiled: "Why do everyone say that? I don't have any spirit. If I did, I'd have won the lottery."
She then looked at Cao Yun and Su Nantian, asking with a grin: "Cao Yun sister, you two are in the same class?"
Cao Yun smiled: "Yes, he's Su Nantian."
Zhao Ling nodded quickly and smiled at Su Nantian: "Su Nantian elder brother, let's officially meet!"

Chapter 199: Guidance

Su Nantian also politely extended his hand to Zhao Ling, saying: "Since you've spoken so openly, let's meet again. I'm Su Nantian."
A warm little hand covered his, and Zhao Ling smiled: "Then... I'm Zhao Ling!"
They exchanged smiles, as if old friends meeting after years.

The others felt like they'd been fed dog food.
Gao Zhi loudly coughed, drawing Su Nantian and Zhao Ling's attention. He feigned curiosity, sniffing the air: "Whose dog food is this? So fragrant."
Gao An laughed at his brother's antics, then mimicked him, sniffing the air: "Smells good. When can I get someone to eat this fragrant dog food?"
The group laughed together. Zhao Ling, embarrassed, quickly withdrew her hand from Su Nantian's.
Cao Yun smiled along but felt a twinge of discomfort.

Su Nantian, however, naturally glanced at them before crossing his arms: "I forgot, a few single dogs. You've suffered." He bowed to them: "Misfortune, misfortune."

Su Nantian's words silenced the five. They looked at each other, faces flushing with embarrassment.
Su Nantian saw they were quiet and continued: "If you don't order soon, you'll be hungry for the match and risk being beaten by the instructor."
The five thought of the instructor's angry face if they lost and instinctively shivered.
"Zhao Ling sister, don't take it personally. We were just joking. Now lead us to the private room," Song Jin pleaded.
"Hmph." Zhao Ling playfully blew at her bangs,得意ly opening the counter door: "Come on, follow me upstairs." Zhao Ling's small figure weaved through the crowd. This was tough for the Gao brothers.

Though the Gao brothers were tall and strong, the lunch rush was overwhelming. They could only be pushed outward.
Behind Zhao Ling were Cao Yun and Su Nantian. The Gao brothers saw Cao Yun and Su Nantian ahead and hurried forward.
Cao Yun was fine, her petite frame moving like Zhao Ling's. But when she glanced at the tall Su Nantian, her eyes showed brief surprise before admiration.

Zhao Ling, Cao Yun, and Su Nantian were the first to reach the second floor. They each had their own thoughts about the five boys struggling below.
Su Nantian saw this as an opportunity to train their agility. He walked toward the stairs, letting them see him, then called out: "Watch every opening and where people will go next."
Su Nantian's words were like a revelation, awakening the five boys who had been blindly moving.
Song Jin and three others focused intently on their surroundings, seizing every opportunity. Their speed increased rapidly, and they climbed the stairs.
After Su Nantian's guidance, the Gao brothers became more agile despite their large frames. However, they couldn't move as freely as Song Jin. Each gap left for them was narrow.
Su Nantian noticed this and reminded: "Don't think gaps are dead; some can be pushed."
Gao Zhi heard this and carefully observed each gap. Indeed, in less crowded areas, pushing someone would create more space. But in crowded places, no matter how hard they pushed, it was impossible.
Gao Zhi relayed this to his brother. The two strong men increased their speed and soon reached the second floor.
Now, everyone was gathered.
Zhao Ling's eyes lit up as she looked at Su Nantian: "I didn't expect you to have this trick. It felt like training."
Cao Yun nodded in agreement, her admiration for Su Nantian deepening.
The Gao brothers were the last to arrive, both feeling embarrassed and apologizing: "Sorry, we made you wait."
Before Su Nantian could speak, Song Jin waved his hand: "What are you saying? We're a team! Plus, it's because Su Nantian gave us this method. Thank you, Su."
The Gao brothers quickly thanked: "Yes, thank you, Su Nantian."
Su Nantian smiled: "No need to thank me. Remember your performance today, as it might be useful in the afternoon match."
The five instantly understood Su Nantian's intent. The Gao brothers, having attended volleyball training camps, knew how important Su Nantian's advice was.
Su Nantian's move inspired admiration in the five, a desire to follow him.
"Alright, now that everyone's here, let's eat quickly so we have energy for the afternoon match," Cao Yun said, pulling Su Nantian's arm: "Come on, hurry."
Su Nantian's lips twitched. He looked at his arm caught by Cao Yun, wanting to let go but fearing she'd lose face in front of many people. He followed her into the private room.
Though this eatery was just a roadside place, it was unusually clean. Upon entering the private room, even Su Nantian was drawn to the fresh air and soft lighting.
After walking around the room, Su Nantian noticed a faint thread of spiritual essence in the air. Though thin, this sparse spiritual energy was considered a blessing in modern times.
This discovery surprised Su Nantian, as he needed to cultivate here before finding an opportunity to return to the immortal realm. This might be a long wait.
But this thin spiritual energy had little effect on him.

Chapter 200: Confession

Zhao Ling saw Su Nantian walking around, carefully examining every inch of the private room. She thought he liked this place and was happy, hoping to see him often.
"Su elder brother, if you like it, come often. Just call me and I'll save a spot," Zhao Ling greeted Su Nantian, "Now come sit down. The food will be here soon. You'll think about the next meal."
Zhao Ling's warm hospitality made the other five boys envious. Gao Zhi couldn't hold back and asked: "Then, Zhao Ling sister, can I come often too?"
Zhao Ling was startled and raised her eyebrows, smiling: "Sure. Just sit wherever you like downstairs."
Gao Zhi received an official answer and shrugged, tactfully giving up. His brother Gao An comforted him by patting his shoulder: "You talk too much."
Cao Yun pulled a chair steadily and patted the spot beside her, saying to Su Nantian: "Yes, Tian, come sit down. The food is here."
As Cao Yun spoke, the private room's door was pushed open by a server. These servers were different from others; their steps were firm, and their presence was stable. Their physical condition...
Su Nantian observed the two servers with interest, finding no flaws and their bodies purer than ordinary people.
Indeed, the spiritual essence in this place nourished its staff, making their bodies stronger than average.
As the two servers entered, everyone at the table sighed in admiration.
"Wow, this braised lion's head is so big!"
"Yes, it smells delicious."
"Look at this tomato and egg stir-fry—it's better than others!"
"Just look, how can the tomatoes still be so juicy after being cooked?"
Though these dishes weren't made by the two servers, their approval deeply influenced them.
After placing all the food on the table, the two servers smiled and left with care, gently closing the door.
Cao Yun urged Su Nantian again: "Su Nantian, why are you still standing? The food is here. Come eat quickly; it'll be too late."
She then kindly took Su Nantian's utensils, pricking the plastic wrap with her long nails. She gently took the hot water pot and heated the utensils.
Su Nantian watched her actions without refusal, sitting down after she finished. The five boys looked at him with envy.
The food was all set, and Zhao Ling had no more excuses to stay. She hurriedly said to Cao Yun and Su Nantian: "You two eat first. Call me if you need anything. I'll go pay at the next room."
With that, Zhao Ling took her notebook and left the private room, closing the door behind her.
The group stared at the feast with increased appetite. After Zhao Ling left, they grabbed their chopsticks and started eating without hesitation.
Within moments, the once-fragrant dishes were disheveled. Su Nantian wasn't particularly interested in the food, merely picking at a few dishes.
Cao Yun noticed this and kindly took some dishes from the distance, placing them in Su Nantian's bowl. She smiled and said: "Eat more; don't just focus on what's in front of you. These are all delicious."
She paused, then added: "You'll need a lot of energy this afternoon. The class's honor rests on you. One success brings all glory; one failure brings all shame. Eat more."
Though Cao Yun addressed "you" generally, her gaze was solely on Su Nantian.
Su Nantian had a slight cleanliness obsession, like when someone else's chopsticks touched his food. Except for the three women in his family, he found it distasteful.
But Cao Yun's every word was reasonable, and Su Nantian couldn't refuse her. He nodded but didn't touch the food in his bowl.
Cao Yun felt awkward and quickly fetched a bottle of alcohol from the cabinet, filling everyone's cups, including Su Nantian's.
The group hadn't expected this eatery's cabinet to have beer.
Cao Yun understood their doubts and smiled: "This beer is free to take, but when paying, someone will check the cabinet. You'll have to pay then."
Gao An nodded: "Of course, we can't eat for free."
Cao Yun raised her full cup and said: "Today's match depends on you. Please try your best to bring honor to the class. I'll thank everyone here for the class."
After saying that, Cao Yun took a sip and was choked by the beer, coughing violently.
Su Nantian put down his chopsticks and patted her back: "Don't drink so much. The intention is enough."
With Su Nantian's steady patting, Cao Yun gradually stopped coughing. Her face, red as if bleeding, startled the other boys.
They quickly raised their cups and drank: "Alright, we understand the class monitor's intention. Don't drink more; we'll try our best in the afternoon match."
Cao Yun waved her hands: "I was just careless. I can still drink." She took another sip, this time calmly placing the cup down without incident.
The group relaxed and stopped worrying about Cao Yun's drinking.
"You guys should drink less," Su Nantian said, removing his hand from Cao Yun's back and looking at the five boys.
Though these five usually seemed unreliable, they knew what was important now and put down their cups.
Su Nantian nodded in satisfaction, then picked up his chopsticks to eat.

Chapter 201: Alcohol's Effect

"Su Nantian," Gao Zhi asked softly across the table, hesitating before speaking: "Today's match... do you think we can win?"
"Win?" Su Nantian asked. "What do you mean by winning? Becoming a hero?"
Gao Zhi was stunned, then quickly explained: "No, I mean can we beat them this afternoon?"
This question lingered in Gao Zhi's mind and also existed in the other four boys' minds. They all wanted to know if they could win the afternoon match.
If yes, it would be a great achievement. If no, they'd lose face.
At that moment, the other four boys put down their chopsticks and looked at Su Nantian seriously, as if he could answer.
Cao Yun saw this as an opportunity. If she helped these boys with Su Nantian, he would think her a considerate girl, giving her more confidence in winning him.
Cao Yun carefully organized her thoughts but was interrupted by Su Nantian's words. She brightened: He truly is the man I chose—his mind was so sharp, persuasive, and he immediately boosted their morale.
"Why are you asking me this question? Or am I your god, making you bring up such an uncertain question?" Su Nantian naturally didn't know Cao Yun's thoughts and smiled.
"No, I just wanted to..."
"You're being unrealistic," Su Nantian interrupted: "You shouldn't ask me. You should ask yourselves—can you win this afternoon's match?"
This statement made the table fall into thought. Su Nantian added: "If your attitude is correct, and you already negate yourself before starting, you've lost. Show your courage to move forward."
"Even if you lose, you won't regret it; even a loss is honorable."
"But asking this question means you've already lost without fighting."
Su Nantian coldly said the last sentence, then picked up his chopsticks to continue eating. He never left food uneaten.
"By the way," Su Nantian said: "Make sure you finish all your food. Leftovers can be eaten later."
This made everyone's mouths twitch. The group, once excited by Su Nantian's speech, now felt like they'd been drenched in cold water. They grumbled and grabbed their chopsticks, wolfing down the food.
They wished they hadn't ordered so much.
Cao Yun's eyes glowed with intensity after hearing Su Nantian's words.
If you don't have the courage to try, what's the point of talking about results?
Only by giving your all can you know the result, whether good or bad. You'll gain growth.
The result is only known after trying. She would never give up.
Cao Yun leaned on her hand, watching Su Nantian eat. Her eyes held not only determination but also tenderness.
"Don't stare, you too. Eat," Su Nantian said without looking away.
Cao Yun was startled, then laughed, her heart pounding again. She took the cup and drank the alcohol.
She needed to calm down, drink to gain courage; otherwise, she couldn't speak.
After the previous exchange, the group had no more barriers. They chatted happily, but thinking of Su Nantian's alcohol ban, they put their hands back.
Cao Yun, who had no responsibilities that afternoon, drank cup after cup, lost in thought.
The group assumed she was a hidden talent with extraordinary drinking ability and didn't stop her. Instead, they praised one after another:
"The class monitor has great drinking ability. Another cup."
"I'll drink to you, but I'll use tea instead of alcohol."
Cao Yun drank cup after cup. Hearing the classmates' praise, she simply responded with a smile, her face full of joy.
Gradually, her expression became unclear. To prevent the last thread from breaking, she finished the last sip and placed the cup upside down on the table. She stopped drinking.
She feared continuing would interfere with her important task, which would be bad.
The five saw she stopped and had to give up, quickly pushing dishes toward her:
"Come on, class monitor. Eat this."
"Eat this; it's delicious."
"Drink some tea to sober up."
Cao Yun smiled, taking a chopstick from each recommended dish. She ended with compliments: "Yes, it's really delicious."
But the dishes Cao Yun had prepared for Su Nantian remained untouched.
