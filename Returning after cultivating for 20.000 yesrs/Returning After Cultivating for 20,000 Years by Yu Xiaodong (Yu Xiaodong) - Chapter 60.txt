The surrounding treasures—golden ornaments and precious items—were more like bait. If anyone dared to touch them, the consequences would be unimaginable.

"Master Tang, I think I've figured out the secret of this place."

When Su Nantian called out to Tang Sanfeng, a shadow flickered behind him. There were only three people present: himself, Tang Sanfeng sitting on the ground, and thus the shadow could only belong to Wang Baizi.

"Wang Baizi, what are you doing?"

Tang Sanfeng noticed the shadow and raised his voice in question.

Earlier, in the dense forest, Wang Baizi had fled in panic due to a swarm of venomous bees, rolling like a log to escape. His clothes were torn into shreds, in tatters, and walking was difficult.

But now his movements were nimble. His eyes glowed blood-red, their pupils entirely consumed by greed. Gazing at the gold and jade around him, his avarice was magnified infinitely. He plunged into this ocean of treasures: "Ha! All mine, all mine!"

Chapter 287: Peril

Though Tang Sanfeng harbored resentment toward Wang Baizi, they were still part of the same organization. All had entered together, and he did not wish Wang Baizi to be harmed. Thus, he leapt up from the ground and reached out to pull Wang Baizi back.

When Su Nantian saw Wang Baizi's and Tang Sanfeng's actions, his heart trembled. A terrible feeling arose.

"Bad! Master Tang, come back quickly!"

Seeing Tang Sanfeng approaching Wang Baizi, Su Nantian shouted loudly, hoping to call him back.

"What's wrong?"

Tang Sanfeng still intended to move toward Wang Baizi when he heard Su Nantian call his name. Instinctively, he replied.

"Bad! It's too late!"

Su Nantian inhaled deeply and pointed his arm at Tang Sanfeng. His spiritual energy transformed into ropes, instantly wrapping around Tang Sanfeng's waist and yanking him back to his side.

While Tang Sanfeng was still pondering why Su Nantian had acted thus, he soon saw the result. The stone statues surrounding them—covered in moss and weeds—had suddenly come to life.

Boom!

Thick legs trampled wildly. The artificial hills and stones, upon contact with this terrifying power, fell apart and crashed to the ground.

The ground Su Nantian stood on trembled at the moment these statues revived. Even he felt unsteady.

Nearly five to six meters tall, giant stone sculptures loomed with terrifying pressure. Their long swords prepared to attack Wang Baizi and Tang Sanfeng approaching him.

"Quick, Wang Baizi, return!"

Fortunately, Tang Sanfeng had been pulled back. Seeing Wang Baizi in danger, he shouted loudly. But at this moment, Wang Baizi showed no intention of returning or listening to his voice.

Su Nantian's other spiritual energy rope shot out, attempting to rescue Wang Baizi. But this man refused the help: "Go away! You're just here to fight me for the treasure. Don't even dream of it. All this is mine!"

As he spoke, Wang Baizi skillfully twisted his body, evading Su Nantian's spiritual energy rope. He did not even hesitate to leave the treasures on the ground, unafraid of the long sword about to strike him.

"Bad! This dead fat man is bewitched!"

Tang Sanfeng saw Wang Baizi's condition. Not only did he block his rescue, but he also showed no signs of fleeing. He remained immersed in the joy of treasures, unaware of the approaching danger—clearly bewitched.

At the same time, Su Nantian instinctively glanced back. His heart jolted with a sense of misfortune.

He noticed the eyes of the lizard-like beast on the stone pillar had opened, staring at Wang Baizi. They glowed with an unusual hypnotic red light.

This red light magnified people's greed, and combined with the gold and treasures on the ground, it made intruders fixate solely on collecting money. They would even give their heads to the statues' blades—terrible indeed.

"Don't!"

Tang Sanfeng watched as these stone figures approached closer, their swords about to fall. He stared in terror.

But the statues were just stone carvings, devoid of emotion. Their long swords fell swiftly toward Wang Baizi's head.

Wang Baizi, however, seemed isolated from the outside world. His eyes only saw gold and treasures; he did not even dodge, laughing foolishly.

He imagined his life after possessing the treasure. Who cared about Tang Sanfeng or the Dragon Group? With this money, he would be the boss. Whether beauties or status, they would all come easily to him.

After Su Nantian discovered the secret of the beast's eyes, he leapt up and tore off his coat, throwing it over the lizard-like beast's head on the stone pillar. The strange red light was temporarily blocked by the coat, and Wang Baizi quickly regained his senses.

He noticed the giant stone statues approaching. His fear was immense: "No, no, don't come near."

This man, though seemingly clumsy in shape, had some skills at critical moments. He executed his signature move—the donkey roll—rolling to the side, circling around Tang Sanfeng's position. Even he had enough strength to kick the right foot of the giant stone statue, causing it to lose balance and stop attacking him.

With its balance destroyed, the statue's long sword attack missed, striking into the treasures beside it. A rain of several meters' worth of precious items fell, all gold and jade—treasures coveted by people outside.

Wang Baizi made a quick decision, leaving the original spot and heading toward Tang Sanfeng. His greed in his eyes gradually disappeared.

"Baizi, come over quickly!"

Tang Sanfeng called Wang Baizi's name. But at this moment, the statue that had just lost its balance collapsed with a loud noise.

Other surrounding statues were drawn to it, their eyes flashing faint red light. Their long swords and spears all simultaneously aimed at Su Nantian and the two others.

Following this, the ground where treasures were placed caved in, swallowing these accumulated treasures into it. It seemed to fall into a bottomless abyss, vanishing at an observable speed.

"Bad! My treasures!"

Wang Baizi had intended to find Tang Sanfeng and Su Nantian. But upon seeing these treasures vanish, his heart felt as if pricked by something. He tried to save them, taking as much as he could. He didn't even notice the danger approaching.

Boom boom!

The massive stone statues moved slowly, each step causing the ground to tremble. Only around the stone pillars was this area untouched by these statues.

Boom!

Each statue stood and attacked, their weapons swinging fiercely toward Wang Baizi. Yet he remained busily collecting treasures like a miser.

"Damn fat man, don't you care about your life!"

Su Nantian cursed and swung his sword, cutting off the legs of two stone statues. They temporarily lost mobility. He then rushed to rescue Wang Baizi.

His steps reached their limit, his feet moving like a meteor. He continuously shifted positions, approaching Wang Baizi step by step. Fortunately, these statues moved slowly. Even so, they were getting closer to Wang Baizi.

"Can't go any faster!"

Su Nantian gritted his teeth, rapidly circulating spiritual energy. He hoped to approach Wang Baizi faster and save him. This time, he would not let history repeat itself.

Su Nantian's eyes were resolute. At the same time, on his right hand, sword energy was fully activated. A series of bright lights radiated from him. His state had reached its peak.

Buzz!

A blade from the statue fell, descending like a guillotine toward Wang Baizi who was still "busy."

At this moment, Wang Baizi felt a chill on his neck. Looking up, he saw an axe descending rapidly toward his neck, emitting a cold glint.

"Stop! Save me!"

Chapter 288: Resolution?

Wang Baizi's pupils constricted, repeating these words desperately. He hoped someone would save him. But Su Nantian was still some distance away.

His heart immediately felt regret. If only he hadn't been so greedy, but time could not turn back. He had to pay the price for his mistake.

Boom boom!

Just as Wang Baizi decided to accept death, a flash of cold light appeared before his eyes. Immediately after, several powerful gusts of wind surged forward, striking him with overwhelming force.

Though this pressure caused his spine to burn painfully, it was precisely this pain that made him realize he wasn't dead. He desperately opened his eyes.

That familiar figure stood before him, blocking the attack from the statue. At this critical moment, Su Nantian had arrived, using his long sword to block the statue's attack.

Su Nantian held his long sword in his right hand, clashing with the statue's axe. Sparks flew as they clashed. He did not forget to urge: "Wang Baizi, you go first. I'll hold them here!"

He had not expected this seemingly old and battered statue to be so strong, its power immense. Even with his strength加持, he barely managed to block the statue's attack.

After receiving Su Nantian's instructions, Wang Baizi immediately regained his spirit. He looked at Su Nantian with gratitude and took off running.

During his escape, other statues slowly approached, continuing their attack. This time he dared not divert attention to anything else. He dodged left and right, reaching Tang Sanfeng's side.

"Hah! I didn't expect this dead fat man to be so agile."

Su Nantian glanced at Wang Baizi who had escaped, his eyes flashing with coldness. He turned to face the stone statue and thrust his sword forward, cutting at the axe it held.

The statues were merely statues without thought. Combined with no human guidance, their movements were simplistic and limited to a few actions.

Su Nantian's steps coordinated with his sword, combined with his formidable physical strength. He sidestepped and the statue's axe missed. Then he closed in, slicing through the axe with one strike.

With no weapon, the statue's attack did not cease. It raised its fist to strike the ground.

Su Nantian leapt into the air, avoiding a direct clash with the fist. The statue's fist struck the ground, producing a thunderous sound like an asteroid falling.

A massive deep pit was created by the statue's strike. Because of this, the statue's arm was bound to the ground. Su Nantian seized the opportunity, running across its arm while continuously searching for the statue's control core with his spiritual awareness.

With Su Nantian's experience and insight, it was easy to find the statue's weakness. These statues could move and act solely due to their control core. If this core was destroyed, the statue would become useless and harmless.

"Found it!"

Within seconds, Su Nantian's face lit up. The statue's control core was on its chest, a slightly protruding area. At this moment, the statue seemed enraged.

It mechanically waved its arms, slapping itself with a huge palm, hoping to knock Su Nantian off.

As it was about to hit Su Nantian, Su Nantian used its body for leverage. He leapt powerfully and then summoned a spiritual energy rope in the air, floating across it to evade the attack.

The statue would not let Su Nantian escape so easily. It was about to rush forward for another attack when, at this moment, Su Nantian pointed his finger at the statue's core. His spiritual awareness locked on it and another sword energy shot out like an arrow.

Buzz!

This sword energy was extremely powerful, carrying a scorching destructive force. It pierced through the statue's control core.

The statue had just begun to move when it froze in place, reverting to its original sculpted form.

After finding a solution, Su Nantian found it easier to deal with the other statues. He thought for a moment and began directing them.

"Master Tang, Baizi, you can attack these statues' cores from a distance—those are their chests!"

Tang Sanfeng and Wang Baizi's positions were relatively safe. These statues would not attack under the stone pillars.

Moreover, as a member of the Tang Sect, Tang Sanfeng surely had many remote attack mechanisms and hidden weapons on him. This was the perfect time to use them.

After receiving Su Nantian's instructions, Tang Sanfeng's eyes lit up. He pulled out two exquisite mechanical boxes from his body and handed them to Wang Baizi.

He himself drew a bow from his back, adjusting it into a longbow state. He placed sharp hidden weapons as arrows and pulled the bowstring to its maximum, shooting fiercely at these statues' control cores.

Statues were lifeless objects without intelligence. They did not notice attacks coming from the direction of the stone pillars and made no attempt to dodge, taking these attacks directly on their bodies.

However, due to the power of the hidden weapons, they did not penetrate into the control core but were blocked by the outer stone layer.

Fortunately, Tang Sanfeng had many hidden weapons. His accuracy was high. Even if one attack did not penetrate, repeated strikes at the same spot, combined with Wang Baizi's hidden arrows harassing them, soon yielded results. The control cores of these statues were successively destroyed.

"Good job! Well done!"

Su Nantian glanced around, seeing their clean and efficient work. He gave a thumbs-up and praised them.

Wang Baizi proudly shook his head: "That's what I do!"

After a frantic attack lasting over ten minutes, the statues in the courtyard were finally eliminated by Su Nantian and his two companions. Tang Sanfeng and Wang Baizi stood back to back, guarding against any remaining threats. Only when everything returned to normal did they dare to stabilize.

Su Nantian approached them quickly, his expression tense: "How are you two? Are you all right?"

Seeing Tang Sanfeng and Wang Baizi shake their heads, he finally relaxed. He found a clean spot for the three of them to sit and rest, regaining their strength.

Su Nantian and Tang Sanfeng had a默契 (unspoken understanding) not to question the previous incident where Wang Baizi saw the statue attack but did not dodge. People have faces, trees have bark; they were all part of the same organization. There was no need to dwell on Wang Baizi's small mistake.

At this moment, the gold and jade on the ground had been completely swallowed by a sudden pit. Wang Baizi couldn't help but twitch his lips. This greedy man had started to feel regret again.

Previously, Su Nantian had casually hung his coat on the beast statue, covering its blood-red eyes to prevent the red light from continuing to hypnotize people. However, shortly after, a faint red light emerged from under the coat. This thin coat could not contain it and seemed to be falling off, moving as if caught in a strange wind.

"Roar!"

Chapter 289: Slaying God's First Sword

A fierce beast roar echoed. Su Nantian's coat on the stone pillar fell instantly under this gust of power. The strange beast statue suddenly came to life.

A massive lizard with a black horn and four wings appeared before Su Nantian and his companions. It let out roars, emitting an immense pressure that cracked the ground.

"Bad! This is the aura of a high-level demon!"

Su Nantian had encountered some demons and monsters before, but compared to this one, they were not even in the same league. If those small pests approached this beast, they would be killed in one move.

Su Nantian's hand gripping the sword trembled violently. Tang Sanfeng and Wang Baizi's legs shook uncontrollably, unsure how to face this monster.

"Hah!"

The beast yawned and its eyes—half-closed—suddenly opened, gazing at Su Nantian and his companions.

"Master Su, what should we do?"

Tang Sanfeng tugged at Su Nantian's sleeve. But Su Nantian did not respond. How could they fight such a powerful beast? Risk their lives?

Wang Baizi's eyes were already desperate. Tang Sanfeng saw Su Nantian didn't respond and knew the result. His body immediately went limp.

"This is the last support of the vampire clan? Indeed very powerful."

Su Nantian sighed slightly. Though surprised, his body trembled uncontrollably. Yet his eyes sparkled with confidence and defiance.

This beast seemed to sense Su Nantian's difference, as if it had found a toy.

"Roar!"

It roared at Su Nantian, spittle flying. It seemed like raindrops fell to the ground, corroding small pits—comparable to some strong acids.

A terrifying pressure spread over Su Nantian, preventing him from escaping. He could only stand there.

Boom boom!

Su Nantian was like a stubborn boat in a storm, swaying but not capsizing. He remained firmly standing, using his body to block the terrifying pressure.

As for Wang Baizi and Tang Sanfeng, their mental defenses had already been broken. Their bodies were under their own control but were violently thrown by this immense pressure, colliding with the wall behind them. They could not catch their breath for a while.

"Can't go on like this. I can withstand it, but both of them will die!"

Hearing the commotion behind him, Su Nantian felt a sense of urgency. He knew he had to act quickly and not drag on, or it would endanger Tang Sanfeng and Wang Baizi.

As a monster with over twenty thousand years of cultivation experience, he was not short of secret techniques that could instantly unleash great power. However, due to his current cultivation level and physical strength, using these abilities beyond his capacity would definitely cause unforeseen consequences.

Now the crisis had arrived. If they didn't fight back, everyone would die here. He decided to take a gamble. It was better than dying passively.

"Alright, I hope there's a way to recover later."

Su Nantian was decisive. Once he made this decision, he would not hesitate or regret.

"Destroy God's First Sword!"

He whispered these four words lowly, and his aura suddenly rose.

The sword energy on his sword had previously been over one meter. Now it immediately expanded to ten meters, with a strong gust of energy spreading out and cutting the nearby statues into countless small stone fragments.

"Wow, what sword technique is this? It's terrifying!"

Seeing this scene, Wang Baizi and Tang Sanfeng, huddled in a corner, exchanged glances. They both thought the same thing.

Compared to Wang Baizi's bewildered expression, Tang Sanfeng believed he had known Su Nantian well. He could roughly guess where Su Nantian's limits were.

But now, he had underestimated Su Nantian. To be able to unleash such power in an instant—even the hidden elders of the Dragon Group could not achieve this. Could Su Nantian truly be a prodigy?

Meanwhile, although Su Nantian looked fierce and his sword energy was unceasing, he himself felt very uncomfortable.

The direct use of a technique beyond his control caused the sword energy to not only destroy the surrounding environment but also continuously damage his body.

Fine sword energy like small sharp surgical knives moved through his internal organs and meridians, causing damage in many places. If he continued to endure this, his body would also be cut into fragments.

"Die!"

Feeling he had reached the limit of control, Su Nantian roared and raised his right hand. He slashed this sword energy fiercely forward.

Boom boom!

A dazzling white light flashed, accompanied by a thunderous explosion. This restless beast was split in two and could not live anymore.

Not only that, the powerful destructive force of this sword energy swept across half of the Black Mist Manor in a fan shape. No matter what obstacles were before it—magic array's core stone pillar, courtyard walls, gates, and connected houses—all were cut in two. The entire manor looked as if it had been sliced off half.

"Old Tang, is he even human?!"

Wang Baizi swallowed his saliva and asked Tang Sanfeng with a terrified expression.

Tang Sanfeng replied instinctively: "I think not. How could a human achieve this?"

"Agreed."

They looked at each other, secretly relieved that they had just happened to be behind Su Nantian. This sword energy was directed forward and did not affect them. Otherwise, even if they weren't directly cut by the sword energy, the residual destructive force would be hard to bear. They were not fools; who would want to seek trouble?

"Phew, it's finally over."

Su Nantian took a deep breath. The weakness after this outburst came immediately. He had no strength left to stand, so he planted his sword on the ground and sat down, slowly recovering.

After a few minutes, he heard Tang Sanfeng and Wang Baizi still hiding behind him whispering. He raised his voice, annoyed: "Hey, if you can move, please help me. Who brought some healing and blood-replenishing pills? Hurry up and give me two."

"Oh, coming!"

They were both veteran members of the Dragon Group. When they went out on missions, they naturally didn't go empty-handed. They had some life-saving good things on them.

Tang Sanfeng pulled out a white medicine bottle, poured two golden glowing pills from it, and handed them to Su Nantian. After taking them, Su Nantian felt a little better.

Wang Baizi asked with concern: "How are you, Master Su? Are you okay?"

"How could I be okay? Do you think that long sword energy was given for free?"

Su Nantian glared at him: "This move can only be used to fight for your life. After that, you're at the mercy of others. Today I really lost out. My body is in chaos and I don't know when it will recover."

Chapter 290: Unexpected Change

Tang Sanfeng understood Su Nantian's current condition was not good. He softly comforted: "It's okay, Master Su. This is an injury from duty. I'll report to the superiors and get you more nourishing things and medicine for your injuries."

Hearing this, Wang Baizi also made a promise: "Exactly! Master Su, our branch in Han City has many good things. Take more with you later. It's all my brother's contribution."

"Thank you both then."

Seeing they were so considerate, Su Nantian nodded in gratitude. It seemed he hadn't made a mistake choosing them. A person who knows how to repay kindness is not bad.

"Master Su, rest for a while. We'll go in and check if there are any survivors."

Tang Sanfeng was cautious. Although the entire Black Mist Manor had been split in two by Su Nantian's sword, if there were underground chambers or secret rooms, the vampires might have escaped. Their mission would not be complete unless they checked.

"Okay, go then. Be careful."

Su Nantian nodded and watched Tang Sanfeng and Wang Baizi leave quickly. After a few minutes, they returned with some items.

Wang Baizi held several luxurious-looking robes and cloaks. Tang Sanfeng carried a metal object the size of a basin, engraved with some incomprehensible strange symbols. In its center was a blood-red crystal glowing red in the night.

"Ha! Master Su, this time it's all thanks to you. We've made a big catch."

Wang Baizi threw those cloaks on the ground. Su Nantian counted them and found four in total. Their styles were identical—black fabric with metal patterns on the edges. Three of them had green patterns, and one had silver.

Su Nantian looked at them but couldn't figure out anything. He asked curiously: "What do these cloaks signify?"

Wang Baizi grinned: "Master Su, I suppose you're not familiar with the vampire hierarchy. Those metal patterns on the cloaks are for high-ranking individuals."

According to Wang Baizi's explanation, in Western dark forces, although vampires were divided into thirteen noble families based on bloodline, they used the same method to determine their status.

The highest rank was the Blood Clan Prince, an absolute ruler among the thirteen noble families. He was equivalent to a patriarch or grand elder.

Under the prince were ranks divided by titles, starting from duke, marquis, earl, viscount, and baron.

Vampires called themselves the nobility of darkness. They strictly adhered to classical and strict etiquette. What people should do, what clothes they should wear, and what words they should say were all strictly regulated.

For instance, the robes of a Blood Clan Prince must be adorned with the most dazzling golden patterns. The duke's cloaks had silver patterns, and the marquis' were bronze. Earls and below were considered middle-ranking family members and weren't allowed to use expensive decorations on their cloaks.

In other words, if there were no mistakes, the four cloaks on the ground represented one duke and three earls. These were all high-ranking vampires who hadn't had a chance to fight back before Su Nantian cut them into pieces.

If they had escaped, they would have caused trouble in Han City. The Dragon Group's headquarters might have suffered a big headache. Considering this, Su Nantian truly deserved the credit.

"Wow, I didn't expect an unexpected gain."

Su Nantian tilted his head and thought carefully: "Since the Tungus family spent so much effort, sending even dukes and earls secretly, it shows that the blood clan relic in the museum was very important to them. You two must be careful."

"Exactly, we've realized this too."

Tang Sanfeng nodded in agreement: "I and Baizi discussed it. Instead of leaving this thing here to attract more trouble, we should take it back to the headquarters for safekeeping. I think even if the vampires were bold, they wouldn't dare directly attack our Dragon Group's main base."

"That plan is safe. Let's decide on it happily."

Su Nantian nodded in agreement and turned his gaze to Tang Sanfeng's metal disc, curious: "Master Tang, what is this good thing in your hand?"

"I think it's a formation array."

As an expert in mechanical traps, Tang Sanfeng explained seriously: "We found this item in the manor's hall. It was placed on the ground, surrounded by a circle of ashes. I guess these were traces left by those vampires after their deaths."

"They gathered around the formation array, connecting their power to control the stone pillar in the courtyard. That's why this beast had such strong combat ability."

At this point, Tang Sanfeng also felt some confusion: "But the material used to forge this array was strange—some kind of meteorite. I need to find someone to research it before I can determine what it is."

Su Nantian, with nothing else to do, continued to ask: "Oh, that's right. What is the red gemstone in the center?"

Tang Sanfeng shook his head: "It's not a gem. It's a crystal core of a Blood Clan Prince, comparable to the inner dantian of a beast or the relics of a Buddhist cultivator."

"Hey, just tell me it's a power crystal instead of all that talk."

Su Nantian wasn't unfamiliar with such things. He had often used them for refining elixirs and weapons in his previous life.

"Give it to me. Let me see what it can do."

Tang Sanfeng handed over the disc, and Su Nantian took it on his lap. He scanned the crystal core with his spiritual awareness, discovering it contained extremely powerful blood energy. People nearby felt a sense of their blood churning.

"Of course, it's the power crystal of a vampire. It's not strange for it to have this effect."

Then Su Nantian extended his left index finger and gently placed it on the crystal core. He carefully drew out a bit of blood energy. At this moment, an unexpected change occurred.

The crystal core, which had previously looked like a ruby, suddenly softened and became like mercury. It wrapped around his finger, spreading to his entire hand, then penetrating into the skin and merging with his palm.

"Bad!"

Seeing this situation, Tang Sanfeng thought the vampire had left a trap on this crystal core. He quickly pulled out various bottles from his pocket, trying to find a solution.

"Don't worry. I'm fine."

Su Nantian stopped Tang Sanfeng, saying he was fine. Then he looked at his now blood-red hand and analyzed it with spiritual awareness. Finally, he concluded that this unexpected change was only beneficial to him. As for the drawbacks, they could be ignored for now.

Tang Sanfeng saw Su Nantian remained motionless for a long time. He and Wang Baizi dared not speak, afraid of disturbing Su Nantian.

After a while, Su Nantian smiled: "I was just saying I lost out this time and my body suffered unknown damage. But it didn't take long to find a solution. Going back and forth, I don't think I lost much."

Wang Baizi's mind was quick. He immediately realized: "Master Su, do you mean this crystal core can help heal your injuries?"

"Yes, exactly."

Su Nantian didn't hide anything and directly explained his current situation: "The move I just used was too burdensome for my body. My insides were already broken, and I needed long-term cultivation combined with various elixirs to recover fully."

Chapter 291: Returning Victorious

"The crystal core comes from a Blood Clan Prince. Its blood energy is very strong and can completely replace those elixirs, greatly reducing the time needed for my body to recover. As long as I cultivate diligently, it'll be fine."

Hearing this, Wang Baizi's face lit up: "That's great! As long as Master Su recovers quickly, it'll be a big blessing."

Compared to Wang Baizi's optimism, Tang Sanfeng was more concerned: "Master Su, this crystal core comes from a vampire. Using it to heal your injuries—won't there be any side effects?"

"There will definitely be side effects. For someone with low cultivation, using a crystal core of this level would surely result in being assimilated by its blood energy and becoming a pure-blood vampire. But I'm different."

Su Nantian spoke with absolute confidence: "Although my current cultivation level isn't high, I can definitely handle this lifeless crystal core. I have a thousand ways to control it. You don't need to worry about me. At most, two months will be enough for me to recover my condition."

On this point, Su Nantian wasn't lying. He just kept some things hidden. This crystal core's power didn't only help him heal but also significantly enhanced his physical strength, at least matching that of Li Zhan, a body cultivator.

As a sword cultivator, Su Nantian's attack power was extremely strong. He had countless explosive secret techniques and his combat strength was definitely sufficient.

The only limitation he faced was the lack of cultivation level and physical strength. This caused great aftereffects after his outbursts, like this move of "Destroy God's First Sword" being a good example.

Cultivation level could only be improved through accumulation and perseverance. To increase several major levels in a short time was unrealistic. Su Nantian had never dreamed of such things, but enhancing physical strength was different.

Although he wasn't a body cultivator before, he had mastered many body cultivation techniques. At that time, his level wasn't high enough. Now with this cultivation level, it was just right. And this blood clan prince's crystal core was the best resource for cultivation, saving him a lot of time and effort.

In Tang Sanfeng's view, since Su Nantian was so confident, he could only choose to believe him. After a few conversations, they rested for a while and then returned along the same path. They arrived at Han City's patrol hall at three in the morning.

After a life-and-death battle, all three were in poor condition. They ate some food and then went to their rooms for rest.

Su Nantian slept deeply, sleeping until noon the next day. When he woke up, he saw Tang Sanfeng and Wang Baizi sitting in the hall having lunch.

"You two got up early."

Su Nantian felt a bit embarrassed and scratched his head. He sat down next to Tang Sanfeng, picked up a pair of chopsticks, and started eating heartily to replenish his energy.

Tang Sanfeng's movements were more elegant. He ate slowly and chewed carefully, even having time to chat: "It's not that early. We got up at ten past ten. How is your body?"

"I'm fine for now. I need to rest and recover."

Su Nantian, with food in his mouth, answered unclearly.

"It's good. Let's leave for the capital headquarters this afternoon. Better to act before it gets too late."

Tang Sanfeng made this decision with sufficient consideration. This time, the Tungus family suffered losses in Han City and even lost a duke. Once they received news, they might be furious and desperate, sending more experts to cause trouble.

Rather than waiting for them to attack, it was better to take the so-called blood clan relic back to the Dragon Group headquarters first. The capital had countless top-level masters guarding it.

Unless the entire Western dark forces united and rushed in, no vampire family would dare to come for a feast there.

"Okay. Do as you wish. I'll follow your instructions."

Su Nantian was self-aware. He had just arrived and had no idea about the Dragon Group's operations or a sense of the big picture. Therefore, he considered his current position as just a violent enforcer.

As a qualified enforcer, his job was simple. He would do what others told him to do. Other times, he should stay low and be quiet.

Speak less, listen more, observe more, learn more—nothing else.

"That's settled then."

After comfortably eating lunch, they went to Han City Museum with Wang Baizi. They placed the item in a special secure box and sent two capable subordinates to escort it.

Of course, Su Nantian wasn't left empty-handed. He had promised him some good things to take back for healing, and one must keep their word.

He had been running the patrol hall in Han City for so long. It was easy to take out some high-grade medicinal herbs from the warehouse.

Thus, with Wang Baizi's emotional farewell, Su Nantian and Tang Sanfeng's trip to Han City ended successfully. They took a specially prepared armed helicopter back to the capital headquarters.
