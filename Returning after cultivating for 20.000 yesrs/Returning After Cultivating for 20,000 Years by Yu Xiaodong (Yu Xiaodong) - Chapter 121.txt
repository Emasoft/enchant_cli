“Then what am I supposed to do? You arrived late today, perhaps you are unaware that our family’s visit this time was not only to express gratitude for helping them retain their position as head of the household but also to discuss our next collaboration. Our Nangong family is about to engage in another partnership with the Wu clan. Yuyan has been overseeing affairs at the inland port, and this time my father intends to entrust me with this responsibility.”

Nangong Ping spoke while his face bore a troubled expression, clearly troubled by the matter and uncertain of his ability to succeed.

“Is this not a good thing? If you shine in this collaboration, it will elevate our status and make securing the next head of the Nangong family even more certain.” Su Nantian feigned ignorance. Did he truly expect Nangong Ping to openly endorse his own capabilities? That would reveal his doubts about Nangong Ping’s abilities.

Nangong Ping nodded and said, “It is indeed a good thing, but I feel as if I lack a capable assistant. If you could return to help me, it would be ideal. Moreover, this time the Wu clan will send Wu Chuan himself. I fear I may not be able to handle such a shrewd opponent, so I hope you will return and assist me.”

“But my tasks at the checkpoint are not yet complete. If I were to return prematurely, it would be disrespectful to both the lady and the master. It might also create resentment between us.”

In truth, Su Nantian was delighted that Nangong Ping had asked him to return. However, he pondered: if he now left the inland port under Nangong Ping’s influence, Nangong Yuyan would likely believe they had violated their agreement. This could result in Nangong Yuyan exposing his identity to Nangong Lin.

If that happened, Su Nantian would suffer a great loss. It was better to remain at the inland port and wait for Nangong Yuyan to transport him. After all, Nangong Yuyan had promised him, and Su Nantian trusted that he would fulfill his word.

“You are right,” said Nangong Ping, “so I am considering this matter. In fact, when I came to your place today, I also spoke with my father about having you return to assist me. However, he did not agree. He said your task at the inland port was crucial and that if you were recalled now, it would certainly help this side but cause chaos at the inland port. So I did not press further, merely intending to ask you when your work there would end.”

Nangong Ping spoke while frowning again, clearly anxious about the upcoming collaboration with the Wu clan. After all, it was Wu Chuan who would appear, and Nangong Ping likely could not handle such a cunning opponent.

Not only Nangong Ping, but even Nangong Yuyan might need to maneuver carefully. Only Nangong Lin himself could subdue Wu Chuan; their children were still inexperienced.

“Therefore, you need not worry, Father has entrusted this task to you. He would certainly support you behind the scenes and would not allow Wu Chuan to harm our Nangong family’s interests.”

Su Nantian was correct. How could Nangong Lin allow Nangong Ping to suffer? Even if they were initially outmaneuvered by Wu Chuan, Nangong Lin would surely correct the situation. There was no need to let Nangong Ping pay such a heavy price for growth.

“You are right,” said Nangong Ping, “but I cannot afford to perform poorly. Father is testing me this time. He assigned Yuyan to the inland port and entrusted me with dealing with Wu Chuan—this is a sign of his trust. If I fail this task, I fear Father would be disappointed. Therefore, I must perform well in this deal.”

Nangong Ping said this while clenching his fists, determined to strive diligently and not disappoint Nangong Lin.

Chapter 602: Smuggling Goods

As expected, after Wu Chuan arrived at the Nangong family, when Su Nantian and his group returned to the inland port, they could clearly sense that Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo had become much quieter.

Previously, Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo had completely refused to cooperate with Su Nantian’s group. Yet this time, for some reason, they had begun to cooperate.

Since there were certain documents that needed to be obtained from them, under normal circumstances they would not have provided anything. But now they were cooperating, offering whatever Su Nantian requested.

Yesterday, curious about this change, he approached Li Zhe and asked, “It seems they’ve been quite quiet lately. Did Wu Chuan tell you something?”

Li Zhe nodded, “Yes. One day, the boss suddenly called us three together for a meeting and instructed us to be quiet for a while. Whatever the Nangong family asks, we must cooperate with them. He said he was about to start a new collaboration with you Nangong family, so we should not cause too much trouble.”

Su Nantian smiled, confirming his suspicions. It was indeed Wu Chuan who had instructed these people after returning from the Nangong family.

But at that moment, Li Zhe frowned slightly, as if hesitating to speak.

Su Nantian immediately asked, “What’s wrong? You look like you’re hiding something. We are already partners, so what is there to hide?”

He felt this matter must be significant; otherwise, Li Zhe would not appear so reluctant.

“This isn’t something that needs to be told to you,” Li Zhe said, lowering his head and sighing. “But I think your Nangong family can’t handle it.”

“First, you must tell me before I know whether the Nangong family can manage it,” Su Nantian said, intrigued. What matter was so significant that Li Zhe thought the Nangong family could not handle it?

“There will be a batch of goods entering the port in two days,” Li Zhe said.

“Is it not normal for goods to enter the port? And Wu Chuan said they should be quiet. Are they going to tamper with it?” Su Nantian asked, puzzled.

“Under normal circumstances, the tonnage of these goods is fixed. However, they have unilaterally contacted us to request additional shipments,” Li Zhe explained in detail.

“Did they contact you already? Why didn’t we know?” Su Nantian frowned and asked again.

“This is the usual practice; they only contact us, the local bosses. The extra goods will be stored in an empty warehouse we find for them and concealed within the specified time, allowing others to take it. The extra money will be divided among us,” Li Zhe said.

After hearing this, Su Nantian understood why Li Zhe had initially hesitated to speak. However, since he had already agreed to share the profits with the Nangong family, he eventually revealed this matter.

Moreover, Su Nantian had already promised him a share of the profits. If he did not speak up, this matter would be divided among the three local bosses based on their own power. But if Li Zhe spoke up, it would be him and the Nangong family who divided the profits. Su Nantian would naturally gain more in that case.

Yet Su Nantian did not understand why Li Zhe said the Nangong family could not intervene.

“I will send someone to intercept these goods,” Su Nantian said directly. “Why do you say the Nangong family cannot intervene?”

“They would block the interests of hundreds or even thousands of other workers at the port. If you send people to take the goods, they would surround you. How many of your Nangong family’s people do you think could escape?” Li Zhe said.

Su Nantian understood why Li Zhe had initially hesitated to speak, but he also realized that it was because Li Zhe had already formed a partnership with the Nangong family. Therefore, he had revealed this matter.

Chapter 603: Being Blocked

After leaving Li Zhe’s territory, Su Nantian immediately called Nangong Yuyan.

“Is there something you need from me?” Nangong Yuyan’s tone was clearly colder than before, as he had learned of Su Nantian’s hidden identity and distanced himself.

Upon hearing this tone, Su Nantian felt an inexplicable sense of discomfort in his heart. However, he quickly adjusted his emotions and said to Nangong Yuyan, “There is a complicated issue at the inland port. It’s hard to explain over the phone. I plan to discuss it in person. Where are you now? I’ll come find you.”

After hearing this, Nangong Yuyan hesitated for a moment before saying, “Fine. I’m currently at one of the Nangong family’s companies. I’ll send you the address; come over.”

As one of the Nangong family’s heirs, although Nangong Yuyan managed affairs at the inland port, he also had other companies to oversee. Today, the matters at the inland port were not overwhelming, so he naturally went to his previous company to handle other affairs.

After Nangong Yuyan hung up, Su Nantian received another address on his phone—Nangong Yuyan’s current location.

Although Su Nantian was eager to meet with Nangong Yuyan, he did not forget about Nangong Fei. After all, Nangong Fei was still sitting in the office; if he left without a word, Nangong Fei might blame him after a day.

Therefore, Su Nantian walked towards the parking lot while calling Nangong Fei.

“Master, I need to go out for a while; I might not return today,” Su Nantian said politely, even though Nangong Fei was essentially useless at the inland port. However, he was still the official manager there, and Su Nantian naturally had to maintain appearances.

“Fine, I understand. Go ahead,” Nangong Fei said, feeling a strange sense of confidence. This was his first time truly holding an official position. Since Su Nantian had always shown him respect, Nangong Fei naturally did not trouble him.

After hanging up the phone, Su Nantian immediately drove towards the address Nangong Yuyan had given him.

However, this location was quite far from the inland port, as the inland port itself was secluded and distant from the bustling commercial areas.

Therefore, even if Su Nantian drove as fast as possible, it would take nearly forty minutes. During this time, he was also thinking about his situation within the Nangong family. As long as Nangong Yuyan did not expose him, Su Nantian could maintain his current status.

But now it seemed that Nangong Yuyan had already distanced himself from him, so Su Nantian felt his situation would never return to what it was. However, Nangong Ping remained unaware and still trusted him greatly, even wanting Su Nantian to help with the new collaboration with the Wu family.

Yet Su Nantian had some concerns: if Nangong Yuyan discovered this, he might subtly warn Nangong Ping not to trust Su Nantian so much.

After all, although both were heirs competing for the position, up to now, according to Su Nantian’s observations, they both strictly adhered to the Nangong family’s rules. When it came to external matters or threats to the family’s core interests, they would certainly unite internally. Therefore, Nangong Yuyan might also subtly remind Nangong Ping about this matter.

If Nangong Ping became aware of it, that would be Su Nantian’s downfall.

“Seems I must work even harder than before,” Su Nantian muttered, shaking his head in无奈. He had never expected the situation to reach this point.

Moreover, Su Nantian was also frustrated because he had become too engrossed in his conversation with Wu You’er, neglecting the sound of someone approaching. Under normal circumstances, he would have noticed someone coming near.

This was likely because Su Nantian had not seen Wu You’er in a long time and was eager to learn about the Wu family’s situation, so he had become too absorbed. He had neglected his surroundings.

But now it was too late; the situation had already reached this point. The only way to turn things around was to hope that Nangong Yuyan would not impulsively expose his secret.

If Nangong Yuyan did reveal this to Nangong Lin, Su Nantian’s plan to rescue Wu You’er would be entirely ruined.

After nearly forty minutes, Su Nantian finally arrived at the address Nangong Yuyan had given him.

As soon as he saw the building, it bore the Nangong family’s emblem. It was clear that this entire building belonged to the Nangong family, which made Su Nantian marvel at their wealth and power. He had never imagined that in such a bustling area, they would possess an entire building.

Not to mention this was the capital city; in the capital, except for Ru Hai District, all areas were extremely valuable. To own such a building was a testament to their prestigious status.

Moreover, this entire building was just one of the Nangong family’s many properties. It was likely not their most valuable asset, as Nangong Lin had not retired yet. The most valuable assets of the Nangong family were still under his control. This building was entrusted to Nangong Yuyan, proving it was merely a part of their wealth.

Su Nantian found a place to park his car and attempted to enter through the entrance, but he was stopped by security.

“May I ask who you are looking for? Do you have an appointment?” the security guard asked diligently.

Su Nantian would not trouble him, so he immediately explained, “I’m here to see Miss Nangong. We’ve already spoken on the phone.”

“Are you looking for Miss Nangong Yuyan, our company’s president?” the security guard asked while eyeing Su Nantian with suspicion.

Su Nantian nodded quickly and said, “Yes, I’m here to see Miss Nangong Yuyan. We’ve already spoken on the phone, so she should know I’m coming.”

Su Nantian understood why these security guards were doubtful. Even though he was not wearing the Nangong family’s uniform, his suit was cheap, making him appear as if he could not possibly be someone who would meet with Miss Nangong Yuyan.

Chapter 604: A Gentle Punishment

Su Nantian observed the scene and could not help but sigh. Indeed, people are judged by their clothes; now that he was wearing this cheap suit, even other security guards thought his identity could not be so prestigious. How could he possibly directly contact their president, Miss Nangong Yuyan?

“Sir, even though you say we’ve already spoken with our president, you must provide some proof. If I let you in like this and something happens, I would be in big trouble,” the security guard said, now entering a phase of emotional appeal and reasoning.

After hearing this, Su Nantian realized he needed to prove his identity. He remembered that earlier, he had asked Nangong Ping for a badge representing him as a member of the Nangong family.

Su Nantian had kept this badge on him every day, fearing he might need to prove his identity as a Nangong family member. Now it seemed he had been wise, so he immediately took out the badge and showed it to these security guards.

“Do you recognize this badge?” he asked.

However, these security guards were merely hired workers and different from Su Nantian, who had directly entered the Nangong family. Although they could see that the badge Su Nantian held was similar to the emblem outside their company building, they did not know what it represented.

The security guard waved his hand at Su Nantian and said, “Don’t cause trouble. We’re busy here. Also, don’t block the entrance; sometimes our partners and employees need to come and go. You’re causing a disturbance. Alright, just leave quickly; don’t make me have to push you out.”

After saying this, the security guard pushed Su Nantian slightly, indicating he should leave immediately.

Su Nantian saw the security guard’s attitude and realized this person did not recognize what the badge was. So Su Nantian quickly smiled again, “Sir, I really need to see Miss Nangong. We did speak on the phone. Why don’t you have the front desk call the president’s secretary to check if this is true? It shouldn’t be a problem. If they say there isn’t, I’ll leave immediately.”

At this point, Su Nantian had no choice but to resort to this tactic. Otherwise, he could not enter and tell Nangong Yuyan about the matters at the inland port. Moreover, he had indeed called Nangong Yuyan earlier, so she should let him in.

After hearing Su Nantian’s words, the security guard was skeptical and looked at him for a while before pointing at Su Nantian and saying, “Alright, I’ll call to check. If there isn’t this matter, you should leave quickly and don’t bother me.”

The security guard then indicated another security guard to watch Su Nantian and walked towards the front desk.

The security guard told the receptionist, “A strange person came to the entrance; he said he had already spoken with our president and was coming to see her. I asked him to leave, but he wouldn’t go. He said you should call and check if this is true.”

After hearing the security guard’s words, the receptionist looked at Su Nantian briefly and said, “Calling isn’t a problem. If this kid is coming to cause trouble, we’ll be involved too. Well, you just ask him his name first; I can’t call without knowing.”

So the security guard called out to Su Nantian, “Kid, what’s your name?”

“I’m Nan Tian!” Su Nantian responded quickly.

“Said his name is Nan Tian. Please check if there’s this matter,” the security guard told the receptionist, who then nodded and picked up the phone to call Nangong Yuyan’s secretary.

At this moment, the secretary in Nangong Yuyan’s office received a call. The secretary immediately answered and said, “Hello, who is this?”

“Secretary Fang, it’s Xiao Li from the front desk. There’s a person named Nan Tian here who said he had already spoken with our president and was coming to see her. I asked him to leave, but he wouldn’t go. He said you should call and check if this is true.” The front desk receptionist explained the situation.

However, Nangong Yuyan’s secretary did not know that Su Nantian had already called Nangong Yuyan, and Nangong Yuyan had also overlooked it. After Su Nantian called, he immediately got busy with other matters and did not instruct his secretary about this.

But fortunately, Nangong Yuyan’s secretary was responsible and did not immediately refuse but instead said to the front desk, “Wait a moment. I’ll go check with the president. Sometimes if it’s directly connected to the president, I can’t get the schedule.”

After saying this, the secretary put the phone down and got up to knock on Nangong Yuyan’s office door.

“Come in,” Nangong Yuyan’s voice came from inside the room, and the secretary immediately opened the door. He saw Nangong Yuyan buried in a pile of documents on his desk and said, “President, the front desk said there’s a person named Nan Tian looking for you. He was blocked by security and said he had already spoken with you. Now they’re asking me to confirm if this is true. If not, I’ll tell them to send him away.”

However, Nangong Yuyan’s secretary was not his personal assistant but only responsible for the company's business. Because the Nangong family had once experienced a crisis due to entrusting power to people outside their family, they had learned a lesson. From then on, except for the Nangong family’s inner circle, all other company secretaries were only responsible for one company. Therefore, they did not know about internal Nangong family matters.

Therefore, this secretary named Fang did not know who Nan Tian was. If it were Nangong Yuyan’s personal assistant, upon hearing the name Nan Tian, they would immediately confirm it was a Nangong family member.

When Nangong Yuyan heard this news, he was slightly surprised—not because he had forgotten about his agreement with Su Nantian, but because he wanted to punish Su Nantian. After all, when he had learned that Su Nantian had entered the Nangong family with ulterior motives, his heart was filled with anger. Now he could use this opportunity to give Su Nantian a small punishment and vent his anger.

So now, Nangong Yuyan was contemplating whether to do this or not.

Chapter 605: A Sudden Realization

The secretary looked at Nangong Yuyan without speaking, unsure of what he was thinking.

After a while, Nangong Yuyan decided to give Su Nantian a small punishment. He looked up and said to the secretary, “I think I didn’t make an appointment with this person. Tell them to send him away; he’s probably just another troublemaker.”

Nangong Yuyan was deliberately trying to make Su Nantian look bad, as a way to settle his score. Although this would slightly punish Su Nantian, he felt it would help him vent his anger.

After hearing this, the secretary nodded and left immediately to return to his seat. He called the front desk and said, “I just asked the president, and she said she didn’t know this person. Tell them to send him away; it’s probably another troublemaker. After all, our Nangong family is a big company and often has people coming to cause trouble.”

After hearing the secretary’s response, the front desk nodded and hung up. Then he told the security guard standing by, “I just called and asked. The secretary said there was no one named Nan Tian. Tell them to send him away quickly; this kid must be coming to cause trouble. How could he possibly have an appointment with the president? Alright, you don’t need to hang around here. Just get back to work; otherwise, we’ll both be punished.”

After hearing this, the security guard walked over and said to Su Nantian, “Go on, leave quickly. This isn’t a place for you.”

Su Nantian was confused and pointed to the security guard who had come over, saying, “You haven’t even returned with the result yet, and you’re already sending me away. I really did have an appointment with your president. If you send me away, it’ll be a problem.”

However, at this moment, the security guard came over and said to Su Nantian, “We did call and check with the president’s secretary. The secretary asked the president, and she said she didn’t remember having a person named Nan Tian. If you’re smart, just leave quickly and don’t force us to take action against you. I know it’s not easy for you, but no matter why you came today, we won’t let you in because your name isn’t on the list. Alright, just leave quickly.”

The security guard was still trying to reason with Su Nantian and did not directly attack him, but the hidden meaning was clear: if Su Nantian continued to cause trouble, these guards would take action against him.

Su Nantian understood the implication but knew he couldn’t fight these security guards. Mainly, if he encountered this situation on someone else’s territory, he could use his skills to teach them a lesson. However, this was the Nangong family’s territory, and these guards were also part of the Nangong family. If he attacked them, Nangong Yuyan might be even more angry.

So Su Nantian could only nod reluctantly and walked out from the side of the entrance. If he stayed there, these guards would definitely send him away. To avoid conflict, Su Nantian left the entrance temporarily.

Su Nantian was confused: he had indeed made an appointment with Nangong Yuyan, but after going through this process of questioning, she said she didn’t remember him. How could Nangong Yuyan not know about him?

Even if he had never made an appointment with Nangong Yuyan before, when she heard that he was coming and heard his name, she would definitely call him up.

So Su Nantian felt something was off. Either these security guards didn’t ask properly, or this secretary hadn’t actually asked Nangong Yuyan but just checked the previous appointments.

Or it was Nangong Yuyan who had deliberately set this up to trap him.

Su Nantian immediately thought of these two possibilities. After thinking for a while, he suddenly realized that this was likely Nangong Yuyan’s way of trapping him.

Although the first possibility also existed, the security guard had called for a long time at the front desk. Su Nantian stood by the entrance and watched the entire process. There was a period when the phone on the other end seemed to have gone somewhere, so the front desk and security guard were waiting.

Su Nantian could infer that during this time, the secretary had probably gone to ask Nangong Yuyan. If he had indeed asked Nangong Yuyan, and she heard his name but still didn’t let him in, it meant Nangong Yuyan was still angry with him and wanted to give him a small punishment.

After Su Nantian reconstructed the entire situation, he shook his head and smiled. He never expected that Nangong Yuyan would still act like a little girl.

He had originally thought that someone like Nangong Yuyan, competing for the position of heir, would have already become very rational and mature. But he hadn’t expected that within her heart, there was still a touch of sentimentality and genuine feelings.

This left Su Nantian somewhat at a loss. What should he do to meet with Nangong Yuyan? And today, there was indeed an important matter he wanted to tell her.

Nangong Yuyan would definitely want to see him look bad, but if he didn’t appear too desperate, she wouldn’t achieve her goal. Perhaps his anger would be even deeper.

So Su Nantian was unsure what to do next, but he couldn’t really fight with these security guards.

After thinking for a while, Su Nantian decided he had to call Nangong Yuyan again. If he showed weakness in the phone, she might be a little less angry.

Chapter 606: Showing Weakness

After thinking for a while, Su Nantian decided he had to show weakness. He picked up his phone and called Nangong Yuyan again.

At this moment, Nangong Yuyan was still buried in documents but heard his phone ring and immediately picked it up. When he saw the screen displaying “Nan Tian,” he turned his phone away and ignored it.

Su Nantian heard the call go through but neither was answered nor hung up; it just kept ringing. After a while, the system automatically disconnected.

He called again, but the situation was almost the same.

After calling dozens of times and getting the same result, Su Nantian stopped calling. He knew that Nangong Yuyan was deliberately ignoring him and would not let him in unless he waited a while.

So Su Nantian walked into the nearby convenience store. This store was specifically set up for white-collar workers, so the environment was relatively good and had seating.

Su Nantian bought a drink and some food, then sat down to eat leisurely. He suddenly felt hungry and didn’t rush to call Nangong Yuyan again.

He knew that Nangong Yuyan was deliberately ignoring him, and no matter how he called, the result would be the same. However, Su Nantian couldn’t completely stop calling her; he had to call every so often. But this time, he just placed the phone on the table without expecting Nangong Yuyan to answer.

After about an hour, Su Nantian called Nangong Yuyan again. He had expected the same result but was surprised when the call was answered.

“Hey, Su Nantian, you said you wanted to come see me? It’s been almost three hours now. Where are you?” Nangong Yuyan asked first, taking the initiative to question why Su Nantian hadn’t come yet.

After hearing this, Su Nantian shook his head in无奈 but still spoke respectfully to Nangong Yuyan.

“Miss, you didn’t answer any of my calls,” Nangong Yuyan did not directly respond but shifted the topic to this, wanting to see how Nangong Yuyan would react.

“Just now I was in a meeting; my phone was on silent, so I didn’t know you called. I just finished the meeting and saw your call, so I returned it. But why haven’t you come yet? If you had arrived earlier, someone would have notified me in the meeting room.”

Nangong Yuyan was clearly confident, not feeling he had done anything wrong. Naturally, he wouldn’t be burdened by this.

Su Nantian smiled helplessly and said to Nangong Yuyan, “Miss, I came here an hour and a half ago but was blocked by the security guards. They said they didn’t know me. I asked them to call your secretary to confirm, but after checking, they said there was no such thing. I could only stand outside and call you, waiting for over an hour. I couldn’t do anything else; I was already here.”

Su Nantian would not say he had been in the convenience store, sipping air conditioning and eating food. Instead, he spoke with a pitiful tone, as if he had stood outside for over an hour.

However, how could Nangong Yuyan believe him? Su Nantian had no place to go outside, but he at least came by car. The stupidest person would sit in the car waiting instead of standing outside for over an hour like Su Nantian said.

But after hearing this, Nangong Yuyan felt a strange sense of satisfaction, and his anger gradually eased.

So Nangong Yuyan pretended not to know and said, “Ah? How could there be such a thing? My secretary didn’t even ask about this matter. It seems the security guards and front desk receptionist tricked you. These people are obviously not doing their job properly. They probably thought you were coming to cause trouble.”

The more Nangong Yuyan said, the happier he felt. He felt like he had won a battle and that the more pitiful Su Nantian looked, the more his anger eased.

Su Nantian smiled at the phone, hearing Nangong Yuyan’s clumsy excuse. He could tell that Nangong Yuyan’s tone was much better now, as if he felt happier. So Su Nantian didn’t dwell on this matter; after all, his leverage was still in Nangong Yuyan’s hands. As long as she was happy and didn’t expose him, it was better than anything else. Waiting for over an hour in the air conditioning wasn’t too bad, after all.

“Then Miss, please tell them to let me in. I have something important to say about the inland port’s new situation.”

In short, what happened at the inland port wasn’t Su Nantian’s problem. In the end, it would only directly affect their Nangong family. Nangong Yuyan was willing to spend two hours arguing with him, but it was ultimately Su Nantian who had to bear the responsibility for the inland port’s matters.

After hearing this, Nangong Yuyan realized he had been too focused on trivial matters and forgotten about the major issues of the Nangong family.

So he immediately said to Su Nantian, “Alright, I understand. I’ll have my secretary come down and pick you up. Wait at the entrance.”

After saying this, he didn’t even wait for Su Nantian to respond and hung up the phone. He was a bit regretful, having forgotten about the major issues of the Nangong family because of this small matter.

After hearing this, Su Nantian immediately walked towards the Nangong family’s building. When he reached the entrance again, those two guards were still standing there. Upon seeing him approach, they looked at him with suspicion and blocked the entrance.

These two guards were using their actions to tell Su Nantian not to come closer; otherwise, they might throw him out at any moment.

Su Nantian could only smile helplessly. At this moment, he could only wait at a distance from the entrance. If he came closer now, these two guards might really attack him.

Chapter 607: Getting to the Point
