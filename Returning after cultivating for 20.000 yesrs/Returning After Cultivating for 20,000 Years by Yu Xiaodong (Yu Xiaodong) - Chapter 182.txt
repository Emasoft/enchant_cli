When Su Nantian heard their words, his face showed no change in expression; instead, the depth of his eyes gradually darkened.

He gazed at them and then wore a mocking expression: "How should I say this? Whether you are foolish or overconfident, I cannot tell."

What was deception? What was pretense? Did they truly believe he could not kill them?

But it was only because he had other plans that he did not strike at them.

"However, you have reminded me of something. Although I sought you for a purpose, there is no need to leave so many of you alive—only one needs to remain for questioning."

After speaking, Su Nantian's gaze toward them was as if he were looking at a man already marked for death.

When the black-cloaked men heard Su Nantian's words, they again wore mocking expressions, believing he was still trying to intimidate them.

"Come on, stop this pretense. If you truly had the ability, you would have attacked us already; why waste so much time talking?"

One of the black-cloaked men shouted at Su Nantian, as if he had seen through Su Nantian's hidden vulnerability. His voice grew increasingly arrogant.

He opened his mouth again, intending to mock Su Nantian further—but at that moment, he suddenly changed expression.

"What's wrong?"

The others saw the black-cloaked man's change and turned to look at him, puzzled. They did not know what he was doing; Su Nantian had done nothing at all, and the lightning still circled above his head. He made no other movements.

"What are you doing?"

The leader, furious, frowned and reprimanded him with discontent.

"Although they have no chance of defeating us, it's not the time for such nonsense. Please return to normal quickly!"

"Yes, the leader is right—don't act foolishly anymore!"

The others urged the black-cloaked man to stop his antics, thinking he was merely mocking Su Nantian and pretending weakness.

But soon they realized he was not faking it; he had truly been subdued by Su Nantian.

"I..."

The black-cloaked man now looked bewildered, trying to explain.

He suddenly clutched his throat as if all the air in his body had been sucked away.

He had intended to continue mocking Su Nantian, but before he could finish his sentence, he felt his breath suddenly become difficult.

"What did you do?"

The leader had initially thought the black-cloaked man was joking, his face showing a hint of impatience.

Chapter 909: Unexpected

Although they now believed Su Nantian and themselves were evenly matched, they also knew he was no easy opponent. They could not afford to be careless until the very end.

Thus, there was no time for such games—but now seeing Su Nantian's fleeting smile, he guessed the other had done something underhanded.

The leader immediately turned to Su Nantian and demanded an explanation.

"Nothing much—just wanted to show you my strength, and have you speak more carefully."

Su Nantian let out a light laugh, his gaze now more enigmatic.

Had these people not previously thought they were deceiving him?

Then let him show them his abilities, to make them realize their place sooner.

"What exactly did you do to him?"

The leader now looked greatly alarmed, his expression darkening further.

He had thought he had guessed Su Nantian's abilities correctly, his face had even recovered slightly and softened. But he had underestimated Su Nantian again; this move was one they had never seen or heard of.

The leader immediately shouted at Su Nantian, demanding an answer.

The other black-cloaked men also glared at Su Nantian: "What did you do to him? Why is he like this?"

Seeing their companion suffer, they could only watch helplessly—this feeling was truly annoying.

"If you want my answer, then agree first."

Su Nantian only let out a light laugh, his gaze toward them now even more contemptuous. What had given them such confidence to believe they would always answer?

After thinking this through, Su Nantian's expression became even more enigmatic. Perhaps it was time to teach these people a lesson, making them know their true identity and ensuring they would not dare speak so boldly in front of him.

After thinking this through, Su Nantian's gaze turned even colder, as if covered in a layer of frost.

If touched by this gaze, one would immediately freeze into thin ice, too afraid to resist.

The black-cloaked man Su Nantian had subdued now turned a deep purplish-red, like eggplant, and could no longer mock Su Nantian with sharp words as before.

"Release him! What did you do to him?"

The leader, seeing Su Nantian's expression grow even more indifferent and recalling the provocative words he had spoken earlier, now looked even more displeased.

He had originally intended to confront Su Nantian and regain some face in front of his subordinates, but he had not expected Su Nantian to be so difficult.

After thinking this through, his gaze toward Su Nantian turned even colder.

"Damn it! You don't understand my meaning, do you? Release him quickly!" The leader now shouted angrily at Su Nantian, warning him.

Then he clenched his fist and rushed toward Su Nantian to attack him.

He warned Su Nantian to do as he said.

When Su Nantian saw him rushing toward himself, he had already seen through his movements. He only let out a cold laugh and, as the leader rushed over, he blocked the attack with one hand while tightening his other fist.

"Ah!"

After Su Nantian did this, the black-cloaked man who had previously struggled to breathe let out a sudden scream.

He groaned in pain, his face contorted with agony.

From the initial deep purple to final pallor, it was as if an invisible rope had tightly strangled his neck, preventing him from breathing.

Thus, he was snapped by Su Nantian's hand.

Su Nantian's movements were fast and efficient, so quick that no one could understand how he had done it.

Seeing this scene, the other black-cloaked men all wore expressions of fear.

Especially when they saw their companion killed by Su Nantian's single move, becoming a corpse instantly, they immediately wore expressions of shock.

They had not expected Su Nantian to kill them one after another in such a short time.

Thinking back on the leader's earlier words to calm them, they felt even less convincing—how could he have been so strong yet allowed Su Nantian to strike repeatedly?

After thinking this through, these black-cloaked men took a step back again, their gazes toward Su Nantian now even more fearful.

If they had previously thought that giving their all could defeat Su Nantian, now they were completely terrified.

"Damn it!"

The leader cursed again in anger, seeing the black-cloaked men completely intimidated by Su Nantian. His face darkened further.

He had not expected Su Nantian to be so skilled at manipulating people, using this move to scare them all: "What method did you use? Are you a cultivator?"

The leader coldly questioned Su Nantian, his gaze now carrying suspicion. He had thought Su Nantian was a cultivator when he saw his attack, but he had not expected the moves to be so unusual—ones they had never seen before.

Moreover, now he used a method he did not even know to kill one of them; the leader felt even more bewildered and uneasy.

He could not determine Su Nantian's identity at all, his mind was in chaos with no clues.

A cultivator did not seem to fit; neither did an ordinary person. According to Su Nantian's current abilities, his identity had become a mystery.

"Who are you?"

At this moment, the leader again asked Su Nantian, his gaze now carrying suspicion and speculation.

Why had such a person never been heard of?

According to logic, if Su Nantian's identity were known, he would definitely be ranked above the master. He should have appeared on their cultivators' ranking list; how could there be no news of him at all?

If they had known Su Nantian was so powerful, they would definitely not have rashly attacked and come to this small fishing village.

"Who am I?"

At this moment, Su Nantian heard the leader's question and his expression showed a hint of confusion. Then he let out a mocking laugh, as if recalling something amusing.

"I would rather ask you whether you know who I am."

If they knew, Su Nantian would be grateful.

Chapter 910: Beyond the Ordinary

Due to memory issues, Su Nantian had long been troubled. He did not know his identity at all.

He possessed a great ability, yet he did not know how he had obtained it. He was also unaware of his former identity—what kind of person he was, what he had done, and who he knew.

At this moment, Su Nantian felt like standing on a small boat in an endless sea, drifting aimlessly. Moreover, his oar had been taken away, and he could not even steer himself.

He could find no direction, nor did he know where his path lay.

"Don't think because you killed a few of us that you can act recklessly. Do you think your identity can hide from us for long?"

The leader, hearing Su Nantian's words, became angry. He thought Su Nantian was deliberately concealing something from them.

How could there be someone who did not know their own identity? It was clearly Su Nantian's trick.

The leader thought about how Su Nantian had been so bold, mocking them openly and refusing to tell the truth. He was even more furious.

Even if he mocked you, what could he do? When the leader saw this expression, he let out a cold laugh and boldly said: "You really are Su Nantian. This boldness successfully silenced the leader, yes. Although he was trustworthy, what could he do? He could only endure the bitterness of being unable to speak."

"Let me be more arrogant!"

Even though his words were silenced by Su Nantian, he could not suppress his momentum. So he quickly regained composure and coldly glared at Su Nantian.

Then the leader rushed toward Su Nantian again, attacking him.

But Su Nantian had already understood from their words that he did not need to waste more time with them.

He wanted an answer, and only needed one survivor.

He just wanted to learn about the things he was interested in; there was no need to waste so many people.

After thinking this through, Su Nantian immediately acted. He bypassed the leader and did not kill him but released all his lightning toward the black-cloaked men.

The black-cloaked men had not expected Su Nantian to suddenly do this, so they could only watch as the lightning they had summoned flew toward them.

The lightning was like silver snakes, wrapping around them with no gaps for escape.

"Ah! Ah!" They screamed in fear, their eyes wide with terror. But they could not react in time and were pierced by the lightning Su Nantian had released.

In an instant, crackling sounds of electricity filled the air; the scene was a tragic one.

The black-cloaked men did not even know how Su Nantian had subdued them, and they were already dead.

"You..."

The leader had not expected Su Nantian to act so swiftly, nor did he know the other had this ability.

He had previously planned a prolonged battle with them, but in the end, Su Nantian launched a lightning strike and eliminated all of their people.

Now only the leader remained, along with one black-cloaked man who had grabbed Xiao Wang's neck.

In an instant, they were all wiped out!

And the leader had no hesitation; if Su Nantian had wanted, he could have killed him as well. Moreover, since he had not even reacted to Su Nantian's move, he would have been killed.

Not only was the leader silenced by Su Nantian's actions, but even that black-cloaked man was stunned into silence, unable to utter a single sound.

The black-cloaked man's eyes were wide open, his eyelids seemingly stretched to the point of tearing.

"At this moment, I am leaving you alive to ask one question."

At this point, Su Nantian spoke carelessly, as if discussing something with them.

After saying this, Su Nantian continued: "If you answer me honestly, I can let you die more painlessly. But if you still dare to defy me, do not blame me for being unkind."

Su Nantian had never liked this leader; he only kept him alive because he was a minor head, and he would know more.

"You're lying! I won't tell you anything, don't expect me to reveal anything!"

Unexpectedly, the leader was not only arrogant but also fearless in the face of death. He had been intimidated by Su Nantian, yet he did not fear him and kept his neck up, refusing to tell the truth.

"Is that so?"

Su Nantian raised an eyebrow without anger, instead seeming to have heard a joke.

At this moment, Su Nantian waved his hand, and two lightning bolts had already reached the tip of his fingers. He extended his finger forward; one bolt pointed at the black-cloaked man who had restrained Xiao Wang, and another pointed at the leader.

Su Nantian's action was clearly defined: anyone who dared to move would be dealt with immediately, without any mercy.

"I won't tell you anything; I'll say nothing!"

The leader stretched his neck, appearing to be indifferent to death. He seemed not to be controlled by Su Nantian and had no fear of him at all.

But he could do this, but another black-cloaked man could not.

The other was merely a low-ranking member; especially after seeing his comrades die one after another in front of him, and witnessing Su Nantian's extraordinary ability, he had already been terrified.

"Don't! Don't kill me; I'll say everything, I'll tell you everything!"

At this moment, the black-cloaked man had already been conquered by Su Nantian. He was terrified by Su Nantian's formidable power and quickly waved his hands, urgently telling Su Nantian, as if he truly intended to cooperate with him and answer everything he wanted to know.

"Good."

Su Nantian nodded, satisfied with the man's response. He then cast a scornful glance at the leader, as if mocking him: "You see, even if you don't speak, there are still people with value."

At this moment, Su Nantian asked: "Who are you? Why did you capture Xiao Wang? Who is your master?"

When Su Nantian asked, he wasted no words but directly questioned their identity.

After expressing his doubts, Su Nantian looked at the black-cloaked man and waited for his answer.

He was truly full of questions now, needing these people to answer them.

"I..."

When the black-cloaked man heard Su Nantian's question, he opened his mouth to answer.

He just wanted to live and not die like the others!

Chapter 911: On the Road to the Afterlife

Who knew that at this moment, the leader rushed toward the black-cloaked man and then grabbed his neck: "Be quiet! If you tell him, will your master forgive you? Do you think you can escape this one and then another?"

After saying this, the leader again harshly questioned the black-cloaked man: "Don't say anything you shouldn't!"

After saying this, he twisted the man's neck and killed him, preventing him from revealing any words to Su Nantian.

At this moment, Su Nantian saw him kill the one who had just cooperated with him. His expression became不满 (displeased).

He continued to control the lightning, preparing to kill the leader. But who knew that the leader was no pushover; before Su Nantian acted, he had already grabbed Xiao Wang and held him in front of his chest: "Come on, have the guts to come!"

He knew Su Nantian wanted to protect the villagers of Xiaoyu Village. If that was the case, this Xiao Wang was naturally the one Su Nantian wanted to protect.

If that was the case, he would definitely not dare to attack him.

After thinking this through, the leader's face also showed a hint of relief: "If you have the guts to kill me, do it with him as well!"

If Su Nantian launched lightning, not only would he die but this child would also die.

Because of this thought, the leader felt bold and believed Su Nantian would not dare to act again.

Seeing that Su Nantian indeed did as he had expected and became silent, the leader's expression also became more smug.

"Fearful, aren't you? Now I tell you, move aside immediately; don't think about attacking me. Before you act, I'll strangle this child and let him die with me!"

"If you don't care about him, kill me! I won't lose anything, as he will be my companion in death!"

At this moment, the leader again provoked Su Nantian, as if he had a trump card and was not afraid of Su Nantian suddenly attacking him.

"Xiao Wang!"

The others had not expected the leader to be so arrogant and treacherous, even using a child as a shield.

"Are you still a man? Let go of Xiao Wang quickly; he's just a child, innocent."

The others again loudly questioned the leader, asking him to release Xiao Wang.

But they had forgotten that if the leader had any conscience, he would not have done this act. In other words, no matter what they said, it was all in vain; the leader would just let it slide and not take it to heart.

"Quickly, all of you step back into the village until I can't see you anymore!"

At this moment, the leader harshly scolded Su Nantian, demanding he move to a distance.

When Su Nantian did not act, the leader slightly tightened his grip, and Xiao Wang immediately let out a painful whimper.

Xiao Wang's small face was furrowed, his features twisted into a tight knot. However, he was very obedient; even though he was strangled by the other person, he did not ask for help from Su Nantian or disturb his actions.

Xiao Wang simply obediently opened his eyes, looking at Su Nantian with complete trust in him.

"Good heavens!"

The others saw Xiao Wang's painful expression and let out a startled cry, worrying about him: "Big Brother Tian, what should we do now? This guy definitely isn't a good person!"

They had previously hoped he would let Xiao Wang go, but they hadn't expected that at this point, the leader was still desperate and would grasp any opportunity to escape.

After thinking about this, they were even more worried about Xiao Wang; they all knew this person was definitely not good-hearted. Since he had traveled so far to enter Xiaoyu Village, it was to capture Xiao Wang and bring him back. How could he possibly spit out the meat in his mouth?

So now it was a dilemma; if Su Nantian let them go, he definitely would not return Xiao Wang. If he didn't let them go, he would directly kill Xiao Wang. This was a difficult choice.

After thinking about this, the expressions of Chen Xiaoling and others became even more conflicted; they could not decide what to do or how to persuade Su Nantian.

"I have limited patience. If you don't want this child to suffer, do as I say. I'll count three numbers; if you don't comply, I'll kill him. Let's all die together."

After hearing the leader's words, Su Nantian narrowed his eyes and looked at him with dissatisfaction.

But he did not act as the leader had wanted; instead, he continued to question: "I'll also count three numbers. If you change your mind and tell me what I asked earlier, I can give you a quick death."

"Haha, have you not figured out the situation?"

After hearing Su Nantian's words, the leader's face first showed surprise, then a feeling of being looked down upon: "Do you think I wouldn't kill him?"

The leader thought Su Nantian was doubting his ability, so his face turned fierce: "You think I wouldn't kill him?"

"No, I don't doubt you'll kill Xiao Wang."

On the contrary, Su Nantian believed he would. When desperate, he would definitely take Xiao Wang with him to die. That was why Su Nantian remained so calm, because he knew the leader could not kill Xiao Wang.

After hearing Su Nantian's words, the leader did not understand what Su Nantian was thinking. His expression remained unchanged; he furrowed his brows and continued to threaten: "Since you know I'll act, then quickly cooperate with me; otherwise, I'll kill him!"

If he continued to threaten, his expression was also very cold and hard, as if he truly would kill Xiao Wang and die with him.

"Then it's up to whether you have the ability."

Su Nantian only let out a light laugh. He withdrew the lightning circling above his head and did not attack him as the leader had expected.

But Su Nantian's calmness made the leader even more uneasy, since he had already seen Su Nantian's strength. He knew the other was not someone easily compromised.

Something strange always has a reason; the more Su Nantian remained calm, the more uneasy the leader felt.

"Hey, what are you doing? I warn you, don't act recklessly; I really will kill him!"

The leader again tightened his grip on Xiao Wang.

Chapter 912: Using Threats

"See?"

The leader added some force, spoke coldly and continued to threaten Su Nantian: "I'm not joking!"

The other thought Su Nantian was doubting his ability to act, so he gritted his teeth and said this sentence.

This time, the force clearly increased; Xiao Wang's face became even more painful, his small face turned red and then purple from lack of oxygen.

"Big Brother Tian! What should we do now? If he tightens more, Xiao Wang will really be dead!"

At this moment, the others anxiously asked, now that all the villagers of Xiaoyu Village were dead and even the child was gone, they had to protect the last bloodline of Xiaoyu Village.

"It's simple: kill him before he acts."

At this moment, Su Nantian calmly spoke, his gaze toward the leader carrying a clear hint of killing intent.

After hearing Su Nantian's words, the leader's face became even more displeased; his eyes were wide open: "Good! Since you're so arrogant, I'll satisfy you!"

After saying this, he prepared to strangle Xiao Wang. He thought that since he could not live, he would make them suffer greatly before dying.

At best, they could all die together!

"Xiao Wang!"

The others saw the leader's actions and understood his intention. Their faces were full of worry, fearfully crying out.

But soon their cries stopped because the leader had no chance to strangle Xiao Wang; before he could act, Su Nantian had already moved faster than him and directly extended his hand toward him.

The leader's face began to twist, for the first time realizing why his subordinates had shown such painful expressions.

Because Su Nantian had drained the air around him and compressed his internal organs with pressure; at this moment, the leader could not breathe, and his internal organs were convulsing in pain, as if they would burst.

"You wanted to strangle Xiao Wang? Since you like this method so much, I'll satisfy you."

Su Nantian coldly spoke these words. His face showed no expression, and his gaze toward the leader carried no emotion at all.

He had originally wanted to get some information from these people, to find out why they captured Xiao Wang. Considering the cryptic words that Uncle Wang had left before he died, Su Nantian felt even more convinced that Xiao Wang's identity was unusual. If they wanted to capture him, it must be for a purpose.

Moreover, Su Nantian was curious about the leader's "master," wondering who this person was to play tricks and call himself a master. It was truly laughable.

But his original intention was to pry open their mouths and get some clues from them.

However, since they refused to speak, there was no need to waste time; let them take their loyalty to hell. They liked keeping secrets, so they would keep them forever.

The leader was controlled by Su Nantian; his breathing became weaker and weaker, and his expression grew even more painful.

But at this moment, he showed no fear; instead, he let out a cold laugh and wore a mocking expression. Su Nantian saw this expression, furrowed his brows slightly, and then loosened his grip a little to let him breathe.

After Su Nantian released the pressure, the leader immediately got a little oxygen and gasped like a fish out of water, desperately inhaling air.

It was the first time he had known that oxygen tasted so delicious.

At this moment, after getting enough breath, he coldly looked at Su Nantian: "It's useless. Even if you kill me, you won't escape for long. My master has already discovered this child; he wants him desperately and will not give up!"

The leader again mocked Su Nantian: "You all should prepare to die!"

"If your master hasn't heard of our failure, he will know we are in trouble. When he finds you, that's your death."

At this moment, the leader knew he was definitely going to die, so his gaze toward Su Nantian carried a fearless look and even a sense of watching the show.

He continued to threaten Su Nantian, then left one last meaningful sentence: "Kill me, I'll wait for you on the road to the afterlife. You will come soon too."

"Master?"

After hearing the leader say this, Su Nantian only coldly spoke.

Unlike the others who showed fear, he found it amusing.

"If your master is really so powerful, I won't mind meeting him. After all, I kill gods and demons."

After saying this, Su Nantian paused slightly, his expression more determined. Then he continued: "Whoever dares to block me from protecting Xiao Wang, I will fear no god or demon!"

Su Nantian's words were bold and resolute, leaving no doubt in anyone's mind about their truth.

"Master?"

He hoped the other would appear quickly, and he also wanted to see what kind of ability they had.

"Regarding you, go die."

The other dared to threaten him even before dying; Su Nantian would not show any mercy.

He directly launched a fierce attack. This time, instead of draining his oxygen, he rushed forward and struck the leader's chest with one palm.

Su Nantian had a bit of spiritual energy swirling in his hand; this simple strike was enough to shatter the leader's heart.

Moreover, when the heart was shattered, he would not die so quickly; instead, he would suffer unbearable pain and die painfully.

Indeed, the leader now curled on the ground, writhing in pain and sweating profusely. His face was terrifying.

But Su Nantian did not give him any more glances, nor would he pity him. This was the punishment he deserved.

Who killed so many people of Xiaoyu Village? His methods were too lenient for him!

The others saw this scene but felt no pity. They could distinguish who was the murderer and who was the enemy, so they would not shed a single tear for these people.

After dealing with this leader, Su Nantian quickly went over and hugged Xiao Wang.

"Uncle."

Xiao Wang, not knowing if he was scared or had been under high tension, called Su Nantian weakly and then fainted.

"Xiao Wang!"

The others saw Xiao Wang fainting and were startled, rushing forward to check his condition.

Su Nantian knew they were worried about Xiao Wang and first comforted them: "Don't worry, he's fine; he just fainted."

When Xiao Wang fainted, Su Nantian was also highly tense. However, he remained calm and quickly reached out to check Xiao Wang's pulse, confirming there was no accident and that he had no wounds. He finally relaxed.

"That's good!"

After hearing Su Nantian say this, they all sighed in relief.

But this sigh did not last long; seeing the mess of corpses on the ground, their faces turned grim again.

Everyone's mood became heavy and could not relax.

So much had happened recently, making their minds highly tense, so they couldn't pay attention to other things.

Now that everything was settled and the battle had ended, they noticed these villagers who had lived with them for many years. Some of them had even held them when they were babies.

But now...

And Xiaoyu Village was a small village with few people; it was a sparse community, and the feelings were deep. They were all like family.

Now seeing them was like their relatives passing away, and so many people had died at once; the expressions on the faces of Chen Xiaoling and others could not maintain calmness: "Big Brother Tian, what should we do now?"

Chen Xiaoling clenched his fists tightly, digging his nails into his palm to let the pain keep him calm.

Even though he did this, his voice still trembled slightly; after asking the question, his gaze swept over the corpses and showed a sorrowful expression. If he could choose, he truly did not want to send them off himself.

"Arrange them properly."

After a long silence, Su Nantian gave an answer to Chen Xiaoling and others. People could not come back from the dead, so if the villagers of Xiaoyu Village were already dead, they could not let them be left to rot in the wild.

No one saw Su Nantian's expression, but they could tell from his tone that he was also in a bad mood. They all knew Su Nantian felt deep regret, regretting that he had returned too late and failed to save even a single villager.

The deep self-reproach on Su Nantian's face was heart-wrenching.

"Yes... Big Brother Tian, this is something no one wanted to see; don't think too much. You've done your best!"

After hesitating, Chen Xiaoling comforted Su Nantian. He knew that Su Nantian was blaming himself now, but this accident could not be avoided. Moreover, Su Nantian had no foresight ability; how could he take all the blame?

"I'll bury them together. Our village's people live together and die together; they will have someone to watch over each other, right?"

He said this with a feigned lightness, but no one had the mood to answer. They only nodded silently.

Su Nantian first took Xiao Wang back home and carefully checked him, confirming that he was just scared and had no wounds. He then covered him with a blanket.

After arranging Xiao Wang, Su Nantian came out to bury the villagers with Chen Xiaoling and others.

Seeing these bloodstained villagers, everyone's expressions became even more solemn.

Chen Xiaoling was the one who could not accept the fact; as a girl, after seeing these familiar faces, she immediately broke down and cried in a corner, unable to control her emotions.

Not only Chen Xiaoling, but Su Nantian and others also had red eyes; they just bit their teeth to endure and did not cry.

During the burial of the villagers of Xiaoyu Village, they all remained silent without exchanging a single word.
