“What’s wrong, nephew?”

Wu Chuan was no fool; he clearly sensed the unease in the atmosphere. He opened his mouth, his gaze carrying a hint of inquiry: “Let the servant fetch it then?”

“No need. Mr. Wu, let Su Nantian handle it.”

Nan Gong Ping refused quickly. Perhaps he felt his excuse was too abrupt, so he added: “He’s my bodyguard by nature. It’s just a small errand, entirely within his duties.”

With that, Nan Gong Ping didn’t wait for Wu Chuan to suggest further and immediately shifted the topic, ensnaring Wu Chuan as well: “Mr. Wu, let’s not dwell on this minor bodyguard. The wetland auction is in a week—how have you been contemplating it?”

Nan Gong Ping said this while pulling out the prepared contract, intending for Wu Chuan to sign it. At the same time, he waved his hand, signaling Su Nantian to leave quickly.

Su Nantian naturally understood that Nan Gong Ping was aiding him, so he immediately cast a grateful glance toward him and answered loudly: “Yes! Master!”

Though Su Nantian didn’t know what Nan Gong Ping was imagining, he had inadvertently helped himself. Since the opportunity was rare, Su Nantian didn’t care anymore!

The immediate priority was to confirm Wu You’er’s condition. Wu Chuan’s reaction had been too strange; without personally verifying, Su Nantian couldn’t rest easy.

So Su Nantian immediately responded loudly and wasted no time, turning to leave at once. As he exited, he didn’t forget to give Nan Gong Ping a grateful glance, expressing his thanks.

The chance to slip out was thanks to Nan Gong Ping’s opportunity, and time was extremely limited. Su Nantian had to make the most of it—no way would he let this chance go to waste.

After Su Nantian exited the conference hall smoothly, he searched for opportunities to find Wu You’er. Unfortunately, Wu Family’s guards seemed extremely strict and thorough.

It was like a net of heaven and earth, with no fly able to enter—let alone a man as large as himself. Moreover, since Su Nantian had come with Nan Gong Ping to discuss matters at the Wu family, he had become somewhat familiar here. If anything stirred, there was no need to think twice; he would be dragged out and spoken of immediately.

The consequences would not only ruin the trust Wu Chuan had finally gained but also disrupt all prior plans—completely a loss without gain.

Yet Su Nantian had finally entered the Wu family openly; if he couldn’t gather news about Wu You’er, wasn’t this a wasted opportunity?

Thus, Su Nantian was truly torn and didn’t know what to do.

Just as Su Nantian was at a loss, dawn appeared and instantly resolved all his dilemmas!

“Mr. Su.”

The one calling Su Nantian was a little girl hiding behind an artificial hill. She had a round, apple-like face, and though she wore a neat ponytail, she looked very young—completely like a child who hadn’t matured yet.

The little girl called softly, and upon seeing Su Nantian turn, she immediately waved excitedly, signaling him to come over.

“Who are you?”

Su Nantian followed the little girl’s gesture and approached, raising an eyebrow slightly. He looked at the girl with confusion, thinking she seemed familiar but couldn’t recall where he had met her.

“I’m Lü Li, the servant who takes care of Miss Wu You’er.”

Lü Li introduced herself first, stating her identity before adding with excitement: “I know Mr. Su is a good friend of Miss Wu You’er! I’ve been waiting here for you these days!”

“Waiting for me?”

Hearing that Lü Li was from Wu You’er, Su Nantian set aside his suspicion but kept a wary gaze. He scrutinized Lü Li carefully, observing her expressions and actions to see if she was acting.

“Why were you waiting for me?”

“Yes! Miss Wu You’er asked me to find you. She said only you could help her!”

Lü Li nodded firmly, speaking with determination and certainty.

Upon hearing this sentence, Su Nantian’s gaze suddenly turned deep. He knew that if Lü Li knew this, she was definitely a member of Wu You’er.

“What’s Miss Wu You’er doing now? Is she alright? Why did she send you to wait for me?”

Su Nantian asked several questions in a row, all concerned with Wu You’er’s condition.

When he heard this, Lü Li, who had been calm before, suddenly started crying. Her tears were like broken pearls, one after another, as if never-ending. She looked pitiful and heartbroken.

But Lü Li’s tears also stunned Su Nantian.

“Don’t cry, quickly tell me what happened.”

Su Nantian was flustered; he didn’t know how to comfort someone. Seeing Lü Li’s tears flow more freely, Su Nantian felt even more headache.

Chapter 681: Bad News

“Lü Li, don’t cry. Tell me the details first. Just crying won’t let me know what happened or how to solve it, right?”

Su Nantian felt his head about to explode; he couldn’t calm Lü Li down, especially with her crying endlessly. He felt even more helpless: “Stop crying! If you don’t want Wu You’er to suffer more, calm down quickly!”

Lü Li’s behavior made Su Nantian feel like a bucket of water with fifteen buckets—up and down, unsure what to do.

Hastily and without knowing where to land, it truly made Su Nantian desperate.

“I… uh…”

Lü Li forcefully sniffed, trying to calm her emotions, but the more she tried to suppress, the more freely her tears flowed. Her voice was also choked with sobs, making it impossible to speak clearly or explain the whole story to Su Nantian.

“Ugh, you really are!”

Su Nantian was even more at a loss and gradually felt helpless. He didn’t know what to do anymore.

“Never mind, since you can’t explain clearly now, take me there directly. I’ll ask Wu You’er myself!”

After thinking it over, Su Nantian gave a direct order. Seeing Lü Li’s emotions were still unstable, he added with a firm tone: “I have limited time in the Wu family. If I stay too long, Wu Chuan will suspect something. Take me there quickly!”

“No, Miss Wu You’er is currently locked up by Mr. Wu Chuan. We can’t go in!”

Upon hearing this, Lü Li’s emotions finally stabilized slightly. She tried to calm herself and urgently told Su Nantian:

“What? Locked up?”

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian’s brows immediately furrowed. His heart grew heavier; he now realized the situation was more complicated than he thought.

Why would he lock Wu You’er up so suddenly? There must be something wrong!

“What’s her condition now? Is she alright?”

Thinking of this, Su Nantian immediately pressed further, needing to confirm Wu You’er’s situation.

“Not good. Miss Wu You’er is in terrible condition! Very bad!”

Lü Li’s tears had been barely restrained, but upon hearing Su Nantian say this, she seemed to have opened a faucet. Her tears flowed freely again.

Not only that, but her voice was also choked with sobs and clearly emotional: “Mr. Su, please help Miss Wu You’er! She’s too pitiful! Please help her!”

Lü Li spoke these words with tears and sobs, crying heartbreakingly. Her voice was unmistakably emotional.

“I will definitely help her, but you also need to explain the details clearly. Otherwise, I won’t know how to help her.”

With urgency, Su Nantian pressed his hand on Lü Li’s shoulder to calm her slightly. Then he asked her to speak clearly.

After saying these words, Su Nantian’s expression grew even more solemn. He had thought the situation was too simple; he believed Wu You’er still held value for Wu Chuan, so Wu Chuan would treat her kindly. He hadn’t worried much.

But he hadn’t expected Wu Chuan to be such a ruthless person. His nature was right there—Wu You’er would definitely have no good outcome.

After thinking of this, Su Nantian couldn’t help but blame himself for moving too slowly. Why had he taken so long to gain the trust of the Nan Gong family?

Because his actions were too slow, Wu You’er had suffered so much unnecessary hardship.

“Mr. Wu Chuan detained Miss Wu You’er’s parents to threaten her.”

Lü Li forced herself to calm down and told Su Nantian the truth: “Also, Mr. Wu Chuan didn’t let Miss Wu You’er see her parents. Miss Wu You’er longs to meet them so much that she used hunger strikes to threaten Mr. Wu Chuan. She ate nothing, drank nothing.”

“Is this nonsense?”

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian immediately interrupted Lü Li’s words with urgency. His expression grew even more solemn. Wu Chuan was a ruthless person; from the fact that he had detained Wu You’er’s parents to threaten her, it was clear this man would never show mercy.

Wu You’er’s actions did nothing but harm herself! Perhaps Wu Chuan would even take out his anger on Wu You’er’s parents because of her resistance!

The more Su Nantian thought about this, the more he felt Wu You’er was acting recklessly—effectively handing over her leverage to Wu Chuan’s hands.

“What use is this?”

Su Nantian said it once, then sighed helplessly: “This is nonsense.”

“Mr. Wu Chuan also scolded Miss Wu You’er, saying she was acting nonsense and even locked her up!”

Lü Li nodded firmly in agreement with Wu Chuan’s view, then added quickly: “But since that day, Miss Wu You’er couldn’t eat anything. No matter how much she ate, it all came up involuntarily!”

“Mr. Wu Chuan also called a doctor, who said Miss Wu You’er had severe anorexia. Now she can only survive on nutrient solutions.”

Upon saying this, Lü Li seemed to recall Wu You’er’s pitiful state. Her tears, which had just stopped, flowed again—deeply sorrowful and heartbroken.

“Anorexia?”

Su Nantian furrowed his brows again, was the situation this serious?

It seemed he really needed to accelerate. Only then could he rescue Wu You’er quickly.

“Yes, Mr. Su, Miss Wu You’er is too pitiful. I beg you to save her no matter what! She’s suffering so much!”

Upon hearing this, Lü Li nodded immediately. Her eyes were filled with sympathy and worry for Wu You’er.

“Where is she locked up?”

Su Nantian nodded solemnly, then immediately asked Lü Li. Now that he knew Wu You’er’s condition was so bad, even if Lü Li didn’t say these words, Su Nantian wouldn’t sit idly by.

“This I don’t know. It was Mr. Wu Chuan’s people who took Miss Wu You’er away. We were all isolated.”

Upon hearing this, Lü Li immediately shook her head anxiously, her eyes filled with urgency.

“Don’t know?”

Su Nantian’s expression darkened further. It seemed Wu Chuan had sensed something and suddenly did this? Otherwise, he wouldn’t have locked up Wu You’er without reason!

Chapter 682: Searching

“Don’t you know either?”

Su Nantian looked at Lü Li, urgently questioning her for more clues about Wu You’er.

“No, it was Mr. Wu Chuan’s people who did it.”

Lü Li shook her head rapidly, answering Su Nantian. After that, she looked sorrowful and upset: “I’m sorry, Mr. Su. It’s my fault I’m so useless; I don’t even know where Miss Wu You’er is. Otherwise, I would have been able to help.”

Thinking of Wu You’er’s current situation, Lü Li was even more worried.

“It’s not your fault. You don’t need to blame yourself.”

Su Nantian comforted Lü Li with a sentence, but the heavy expression on his face never disappeared. In fact, it deepened further.

But Su Nantian also knew that Wu Chuan’s determined actions would not be known by a small servant like Lü Li. If he truly knew every move, his position would be forfeit!

But this made rescuing Wu You’er even more difficult.

Thinking of these, Su Nantian’s expression grew even more solemn. His aura changed, making people fear to approach him.

“By the way, Lü Li, do you have any way of finding out where Wu You’er is?”

Since the situation had become a certainty, it wasn’t time to dwell on self-pity or waste time with melancholy. The immediate priority was to find Wu You’er quickly.

“I’m not a member of the Wu family, so I can’t stay here long. Therefore, finding out where Miss Wu You’er is must be up to you. Do you have any ideas?”

Su Nantian collected his thoughts and looked at Lü Li seriously.

“I… I’m just a small servant, I…”

Lü Li bit her lip, her eyes filled with fear. Her face was also full of worry—clearly she was afraid and worried about not being able to help.

“But you are in the Wu family, and since you’re just a small servant, no one pays attention to you. This actually makes it easier for you to find Wu You’er.”

Su Nantian said confidently, giving Lü Li a reassuring word. Then he deliberately questioned her: “Is it possible that your feelings for Wu You’er are fake? Even if she were to die in Wu Chuan’s captivity, you wouldn’t care?”

“No!”

Lü Li immediately shouted at Su Nantian’s last question, protesting: “Miss Wu You’er was very kind to me. I also like Miss Wu You’er! If I can help, I will!”

“That’s right.”

Su Nantian nodded in satisfaction. He knew this little girl had the courage to come and inform him, so she wasn’t timid. Perhaps she was just raised in the Wu family and knew of Wu Chuan’s power, so she had been suppressed.

But these qualities could be stimulated and would yield much.

“Then I’ll entrust the task of finding Wu You’er to you.”

Su Nantian said seriously to Lü Li, then remembered another thing and asked her: “By the way, you’ve been in the Wu family all this time. Have you seen Wu You’er’s parents? Did Wu Chuan mention them?”

Su Nantian’s mission wasn’t just about Wu You’er alone. If it were only her, he wouldn’t have gone to such lengths to infiltrate the Nan Gong family. He would have just come directly to rescue Wu You’er from the Wu family.

This time, he also needed to take Wu You’er’s parents with him. Unfortunately, Wu Chuan was too meticulous, and he had spent too much time gaining the trust of the Nan Gong family. There was no opportunity to investigate Wu You’er’s parents.

Although people outside were also searching for Wu You’er’s parents, there had been no progress. Su Nantian asked Lü Li in this way to find internal clues, and if there were any leads, it might be easier to locate Wu You’er’s parents.

“No.”

Lü Li’s answer disappointed Su Nantian greatly: “I’ve never seen Miss Wu You’er’s parents. None of the other servants have either. Even Miss Wu You’er only met them once from afar.”

Saying this, Lü Li lowered her head in guilt, as if she felt too useless to help.

“Alright, I understand.”

Su Nantian had been thinking of asking just to see if there was a surprise. Lü Li not having seen them was something he had anticipated. So now, upon hearing this answer, Su Nantian wasn’t too surprised.

“Then I’ll entrust the task of finding Wu You’er to you. If you find her, please let her know I’ll look after her parents and tell her not to act recklessly anymore.”

Su Nantian thought of something else, so he immediately instructed Lü Li.

He didn’t want Wu You’er to pull another trick again. If she accidentally angered Wu Chuan or miscalculated, it would be too late to regret.

“Okay! Mr. Su, please rest assured I’ll tell Miss Wu You’er.”

Lü Li nodded obediently and asked Su Nantian: “Mr. Su, if I find her, how should I notify you?”

“Can you go out?”

Upon hearing Lü Li’s question, Su Nantian snapped back to reality and asked her immediately.

“Yes, and as a small servant like me, no one would pay attention.”

Lü Li nodded immediately. Then she added: “But we can only go out twice a month, and if we exceed that number, we have to apply to the housekeeper!”

“That’s fine.”

Su Nantian nodded thoughtfully. Since she could go out freely, it would save many unnecessary troubles.

“If you find her, go to the third fish stall in the eastern market and tell the boss.”

Su Nantian told Lü Li the contact method.

“Can’t you just come directly to find me?”

Lü Li was confused, hoping that once she found a clue, she could immediately inform Su Nantian. This would save time and help Wu You’er quickly.

“Mr. Wu’s family isn’t as simple as you think. Even when you go out, they will definitely send someone to follow.”

Su Nantian smiled and explained this to Lü Li. As for why Lü Li hadn’t noticed, it could only be said that this little girl was too inexperienced.

“Ah? Even we are being followed?”

Lü Li was truly stunned, looking at Su Nantian in disbelief.

“Of course.”

With Wu Chuan’s suspicious nature, he would definitely have everything under control.

“Finding Wu You’er is urgent, but you also need to be careful. Don’t get yourself caught before finding her.”

Su Nantian remembered another thing and gave Lü Li a final warning.

Chapter 683: Suspicion

“Master, the gift box has been brought. However, I couldn’t find your watch. Please punish me, Master.”

To play the role fully, especially before Wu Chuan, a shrewd old fox.

So after Su Nantian finished talking to Lü Li, he did everything he was supposed to do. Then he returned to Nan Gong Ping, as he hadn’t found the watch and showed an anxious expression.

“Fool! You couldn’t even find a small watch!”

Nan Gong Ping was also very cooperative, immediately frowning and scolding Su Nantian: “This time I’ll overlook it as a first offense. Deduct three months’ salary! If there’s another time, you’ll be fired!”

“Thank you, Master.”

Su Nantian naturally knew that Nan Gong Ping was acting to show Wu Chuan. He also cooperated by lowering his head, making himself look extremely low, as if truly afraid of Nan Gong Ping.

“Nonsense! Go away!”

Nan Gong Ping looked at Su Nantian with disdain, as if seeing him was an annoyance.

Su Nantian cooperated by standing behind Nan Gong Ping, directly facing Wu Chuan’s position. He looked quiet and composed, as if focused on his nose.

“Haha, nephew, what’s the matter? Why are you so angry?”

Wu Chuan watched the scene quietly, and after the curtain fell, he smiled and played the good guy.

“Alas, Master Wu, you don’t know. This Su Nantian seems smart but is actually a blockhead. And he’s been careless lately. I just gave him a small punishment.”

Nan Gong Ping sighed and complained to Wu Chuan. After that, he shifted the topic: “Alas, don’t talk about this nuisance anymore. Master Wu, I came here with an important matter.”

After saying that, Nan Gong Ping pushed the contract on the table forward a little, signaling Wu Chuan to sign it.

“Haha, important matter. I naturally know.”

Wu Chuan smiled again, but upon closer inspection, a flash of light passed through his eyes.

“Since you don’t mind my old age, I’ll sign it.”

The next moment, Wu Chuan did something that surprised everyone. He signed the contract immediately without even looking at it.

“Master Wu…”

Even Nan Gong Ping showed a moment of surprise, not expecting Wu Chuan to be so cooperative. He had thought Wu Chuan would again play the game of avoiding responsibility and pretending to be crazy, pushing it back again!

But this time he was surprisingly quick.

“Why? Nephew, are you regretting having an old man like me join your team? I was just worried that you might have a sudden idea and not make up your mind. Now seeing you came three times, as an elder I should show some sign of appreciation, right?”

Wu Chuan smiled and spoke kindly. His expression was genuine, as if these words were all from his heart.

But those who knew Wu Chuan would understand that “kindness” was never a suitable description for him.

“Master Wu, you overthink it. I’m delighted to have you cooperate with us. How could I dare to look down on Master Wu? This should be the other way around.”

Nan Gong Ping quickly recovered and responded to Wu Chuan’s words. Then he said: “My father will be very happy upon hearing this.”

“Nephew, let’s cooperate!”

Wu Chuan smiled again with a harmless expression and extended his hand to shake Nan Gong Ping’s, as if truly happy to cooperate with them.

After that, Wu Chuan also chatted with Nan Gong Ping for a while. The two of them took turns complimenting each other, almost exhausting all the good words.

Wu Chuan even invited Nan Gong Ping to stay for dinner. It was only after Nan Gong Ping insisted with other important matters that he finally left Wu Chuan’s house.

“Something is off.”

After Nan Gong Ping and Su Nantian left, Wu Chuan’s smile immediately disappeared. He whispered to himself and turned his head to look at Li Assistant behind him.

“What’s off about it? A servant didn’t do his job well, and Master Nan Gong was a bit angry. That’s normal.”

Li Assistant was secretly happy! He didn’t like Su Nantian, so he felt delighted seeing Su Nantian being scolded by Nan Gong Ping.

“I think Master Wu is overthinking.”

Li Assistant’s mood was good, so his mouth wasn’t closed. He almost said something inappropriate and immediately realized it, sweating coldly.

“Bring up the surveillance footage.”

Wu Chuan coldly glanced at Li Assistant, feeling some dislike. This Li Mu was personally selected by Wu Chuan and had been with him for over twenty years.

His previous performance was normal, and his work was efficient. But when did he start to be so easily influenced by personal feelings? And it seemed more relaxed than before.

Thinking of this, Wu Chuan’s gaze became colder toward Li Assistant. He decided to give him another chance; if he didn’t restrain himself, this person wouldn’t be kept.

“Yes!”

Li Assistant was so scared his feet were sweating. He stood straight and immediately answered loudly, no longer delaying or wasting time. He went to bring up the surveillance footage immediately.

The screen showed that Su Nantian had indeed gone to the parking lot and searched his car, with no suspicious behavior during that time.

“Maybe I was overthinking this time?”

Wu Chuan took his eyes off the surveillance footage and whispered to himself, a thoughtful expression on his face.

But since nothing had happened, it was also good news.

Caution is the key to long-term safety. Wu Chuan had relied on his patience and carefulness to eliminate all potential heirs of the Wu family.

It was also because of this caution that he had tightly controlled the vast Wu family business.

“Haha, but this time wasn’t entirely without gain. I found something interesting.”

Wu Chuan composed himself and, not knowing what he was thinking, his lips curled into a smile. This time, he truly wore a genuine smile: “This matter is getting more interesting.”

“Master Wu, what do you mean?”

Li Assistant seemed to realize Wu Chuan’s dislike for him. This time, his attitude was cautious and attentive, always watching Wu Chuan’s expression.

He also paid attention to everything, speaking with a hint of testing and anxiety, as if afraid he would say something wrong again and make Wu Chuan completely dislike him.

Chapter 684: The Lucky Scale

“Good, Ah Mu, you also saw it. Nan Gong Ping scolded Su Nantian like he was a dog.”

Wu Chuan’s lips curved deeper, forming an even more sinister arc. His eyes also narrowed slightly, hiding a glint of danger.

“He’s just Nan Gong Ping’s servant. This attitude is normal.”

Li Assistant thought it was completely normal. After all, he would be happy to see Su Nantian scolded by Nan Gong Ping every day!

“Haha, Ah Mu, didn’t you notice this? Try to imagine: have you ever seen Su Nantian act so obediently?”

Wu Chuan seemed in a good mood. Seeing Li Assistant hadn’t noticed the details, he smiled and pointed it out to him, making Li Assistant pay attention to the key points.

“Of course not! Su Nantian is arrogant and proud. How could he be willing to be a tail-wagging dog?”

Li Assistant immediately denied this after hearing Wu Chuan’s question.

According to Li Assistant’s view of Su Nantian, he was just a small bodyguard who dared to demand the position of head housekeeper. From this, it could be guessed he was an ambitious person.

Therefore, Li Assistant would never believe that Su Nantian had no reaction to Nan Gong Ping’s scolding.

“Haha, that’s right.”

After hearing Li Assistant’s words, Wu Chuan smiled even more: “Nan Gong Lin, you and I have been fighting for half a lifetime. I never thought it would be your own descendant who defeated you!”

Wu Chuan felt his mood was extremely pleasant, especially thinking that Nan Gong Lin’s descendant was a foolish fool. He felt even more pleased.

“Wait and see the play, Su Nantian is not a person who would endure silently.”

Wu Chuan said again, his words carrying a smile. Clearly, he was in a good mood.

And the more Nan Gong Ping didn’t value Su Nantian, the happier Wu Chuan felt. Because this meant that the balance was slowly tilting toward his side.

Now he just needed to wait for Su Nantian to explode with anger, and he would be the first to sacrifice Nan Gong Ping.

And the more chaotic the Nan Gong family became, the better it was for Wu Chuan!

“Hahaha!”

Wu Chuan thought of these things and felt even more pleased, unable to stop laughing: “Su Nantian, I hope your anger comes strongly. Don’t let me down!”

Meanwhile, Nan Gong Ping wasn’t idle either. He held the contract signed by Wu Chuan. Even after sitting in the car back, he still felt a bit unreal.

Nan Gong Ping felt like he was walking on cotton; each step had no real sense.

And the more Nan Gong Ping thought, the more he felt something was off. He always felt strange.

“Master Nan Gong, do you have any worries?”

Su Nantian sat quietly beside Nan Gong Ping. Upon noticing Nan Gong Ping’s thoughtful expression, he asked softly and looked at him with concern, as if ready to help.

“Yes, I have a doubt.”

After witnessing Su Nantian’s abilities, Nan Gong Ping had already regarded him as half a teacher and also treated him as his strategist.

Therefore, Nan Gong Ping would immediately tell Su Nantian about any doubts in his heart and let Su Nantian analyze them.

“I never thought this old fox would play tricks again, but he signed so quickly and even seemed to be genuinely cooperative!”

Nan Gong Ping told Su Nantian about his inner doubts. The more he thought, the more he felt this situation was strange.

Normally, Wu Chuan, a long-time high-ranking old fox, would definitely demand some skin before finally signing. He would take some benefits at least!

But he didn’t ask for anything, and even smiled and spoke kindly. And when signing, it was straightforward and decisive.

“Since Wu Chuan signed the contract, it’s a good thing. Why are you worrying about this?”

Su Nantian immediately understood what Nan Gong Ping was worried about. It was simply because the signing was too smooth, and he felt there might be a trick, so he had been cautious all the way and thought about it on the road.

“It’s a good thing, but I still feel he has problems!”

Nan Gong Ping was truly puzzled. This signing of Wu Chuan seemed like a gift from the sky, so Nan Gong Ping was uneasy and felt there might be a trick.

“Master Nan Gong, do you remember the analysis we did together before? Wu Chuan’s age is enough to be your elder, and his status is clear. The cooperation between the Nan Gong family and Wu family has already been decided, and everyone can see it.”

Su Nantian spoke slowly, using a calming tone to ease Nan Gong Ping’s inner unease: “The previous two times were just Wu Chuan playing a game. But now, there is only one week until the auction. And since it’s the third time, he knows how to behave, so he signed this time with a kind and friendly attitude.”

What Su Nantian omitted was that Wu Chuan this time was merely using Nan Gong Ping’s posture but couldn’t be too harsh, fearing that if he was too harsh, it would make Nan Gong Lin protect his child. Then everything would be a waste of effort and end in nothing.

Moreover, now that they had signed the contract, it was just about cooperating to win the auction. As for how to divide the profits and what proportion, there was still a big play to watch.

Therefore, Wu Chuan didn’t need to waste much time on small matters at the beginning. And since he had already taken the bait, he didn’t need to waste much time either.

“Ah! That’s it!”

After Su Nantian explained this, Nan Gong Ping immediately understood. He showed a look of realization and then said with resentment: “Hmph! Truly calculating everything!”

After saying this, Nan Gong Ping gritted his teeth and looked even more resentful.

“Don’t mention these annoying things. I still need to congratulate Master Nan Gong for finally fulfilling the elder’s orders.”

Su Nantian bowed and congratulated Nan Gong Ping.

Nan Gong Ping immediately showed a happy smile, then waved his hand: “This is just the first step. It’s not worth celebrating yet. The real performance is coming next!”

Nan Gong Ping said this, but his expression was full of pride and arrogance, as if he had already heard the sound of victory.

Chapter 685: Sibling Quarrel

“By the way, Nantian, I’ve delayed you for so long. Have you seen your beloved?”

After Nan Gong Ping resolved the heavy burden on his heart, he started to be unprofessional. He asked playfully while teasing Su Nantian, waiting for him to answer and then mock him.

“No, Master Nan Gong, I didn’t see Miss Wu You’er.”

Su Nantian shook his head and showed a disappointed expression. Then he looked at Nan Gong Ping seriously, correcting him: “But Master Nan Gong, you really shouldn’t joke about Miss Wu You’er with me. I’ve told you before, what position am I in? I truly dare not imagine Miss Wu You’er!”

After saying this, Su Nantian looked at Nan Gong Ping seriously with genuine eyes, hoping he wouldn’t joke about Wu You’er anymore.

After all, it wasn’t funny at all!

He had no interest in getting involved with his mission goal.

“Ugh! You’re back again! I’ve told you many times, right?”

Nan Gong Ping immediately looked at Su Nantian with disdain upon seeing him say this. Then he sighed and said to Su Nantian in disappointment: “I said, are you a man? Why are you so hesitant and not bold at all! Where did your efficiency in handling affairs go!”

After saying this, Nan Gong Ping looked at Su Nantian with disdain again.

“This… I am definitely a man, Master Nan Gong! Don’t play jokes anymore!”
