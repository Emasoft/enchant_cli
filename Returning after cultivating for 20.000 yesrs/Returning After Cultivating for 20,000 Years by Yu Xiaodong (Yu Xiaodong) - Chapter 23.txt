"Give Su Nantian a reminder, letting him know I'm here. As for concealing my aura before, it's just the innate ability of this raven."

Only its blood or feathers would be detected by others, but the raven itself remained completely invisible.

When Su Nantian heard the call behind him, he was momentarily stunned—this sound was truly unbearable.

He turned around and saw a large black bird perched on a sharp corner, gazing at him with eyes like red rubies, which carried a faint trace of kindness.

At this moment, the array for sealing the pact was finally completed. Su Nantian gave a slight nod to the raven, then stepped into one of the array's cells.

The raven nodded in return and leaped down from its perch, taking a few steps toward another cell.

But just then, a loud shout echoed from the distant sky.

"Monster! I've finally found you!"

A cultivation level five could not fly, yet Wu Jialao, the head of the Wu family, was hovering in midair.

A fluctuation of a magical artifact emanated from him. Su Nantian narrowed his eyes slightly, realizing the Wu family indeed had some resources—possessing such a trivial artifact.

This kind of artifact was considered useless for cultivation level five, as long-range combat abilities were scarce at this stage. Close combat was the norm for battle, making flight unnecessary.

Once one advanced to the innate level, they could briefly glide through the air using their own strength. The effect would be similar to this artifact, but consuming far less spiritual energy.

In short, it was a useless item for cultivation level five and an awkward tool for the innate level. Few sects with modest resources would bother crafting it.

Hearing Wu Jialao's shout, the raven walking toward the array turned its head and glanced at the old man.

"Ga! Ga!"

Although Su Nantian couldn't understand the raven's cawing, he could sense a clear tone of mockery and curses.

If translated into human language, it would roughly be: "You bastard old man... You're so tough, come kill your raven master!"

Su Nantian was genuinely stunned. This raven had a bold temper.

While cursing, it also turned to gesture toward Su Nantian in a friendly manner. Clearly, this creature had its own plans.

If not for the rarity of spirits, Su Nantian might have considered changing his target.

Wu Jialao wasn't too close, so he couldn't see the raven's tiny eyes. He was not overly angry but instead approached quickly while shouting at Su Nantian: "That boy over there, I am the head of the Wu family in Hezhou. Catch that raven for me quickly, or I won't be kind to you!"

Chapter 103: Death Raven

Hearing Wu Jialao's words, Su Nantian felt a bit annoyed. I'm at the peak of cultivation level six, and you're only at level five. Who gave you the courage to shout at me like that?

I haven't hidden my aura, and with such proximity, could you really not sense it?

Actually, Su Nantian had misjudged Wu Jialao. In the current cultivation world, aura sensing could only roughly determine one's strength, not precisely identify their level.

After all, not everyone was like Su Nantian, a veteran who had spent 20,000 years in the cultivation world.

Ignoring Wu Jialao's roar, Su Nantian continued walking into the array without looking up.

As for Wu Jialao flying toward him, it was left to Su Yujian to block.

To be honest, sometimes Su Nantian envied Su Yujian. He didn't need to search or refine weapons; he just needed to gather some materials, shape them roughly, and place them beside his deity statue for worship. Once enough faith power was absorbed, they naturally became the desired divine weapons or beloved items.

Moreover, these divine weapons could enhance their power as faith increased, and the compatibility with the deity was quite high.

But since Su Nantian wasn't of the Wu family, whether weapons or spirits, he had to refine them one by one.

The large raven was already in place within the array. Su Nantian stepped into his designated spot and lightly stamped his foot, infusing spiritual energy into the array to activate it.

Suddenly, 108 jade pendants each began to glow with an eerie light, interconnecting to form a unique array that enveloped Su Nantian and the raven.

Unexplainably, Su Nantian felt a connection with the opposite raven—indescribable and mysterious. This bond was more profound than his connection with Su Yujian!

Su Nantian and Su Yujian's relationship was like that of left and right hands. Though they had their own thoughts, they were a complete whole.

But Su Nantian's connection with this raven was different. It felt like a mutual bond without the ability to force each other into anything.

The raven clearly felt this connection, and its gaze toward Su Nantian became even more amiable. Though there had been kindness in its eyes before, a trace of vigilance remained deep within.

Now it truly regarded Su Nantian as one of its own!

As the array activated, Su Nantian felt a strange sensation—something inexplicably transferred from the raven to himself, while his certain characteristics were also imbued into the raven's body.

This exchange of properties caused no trouble or harm to either party but instead brought considerable benefits.

Feeling the fluctuations on the raven's body, Su Nantian slightly moved his fingers, and a streak of gray energy flowed at his fingertips.

This energy was withering, decaying, giving off a sense of death.

"Death qi?" Su Nantian muttered. He had never imagined that there would be a creature in this world cultivating death qi.

He had always thought it was just a raven, as Wu Jialao and Su Yujian also believed. But after sealing the pact, Su Nantian discovered it wasn't a raven but its relative—the death raven.

Compared to ravens, death ravens were taller. Their beaks and claws were sharper, heavier, and their feathers fluffier.

The current death raven could be called a harbinger of disaster and ill omen. Cultivating death qi, this title was no exaggeration.

It stood about one meter tall with a wingspan of nearly 180 cm. Though it couldn't match the great eagles, it was still a master of the skies.

From afar, Wu Jialao finally noticed an array on the rooftop and realized it had already been activated.

Without thinking much, he reached into his sleeve and pulled out two small balls, throwing them toward Su Nantian.

At present, Su Nantian's steel body could withstand bullets from a sniper without any problem. Yet facing these two small balls thrown by Wu Jialao, he felt a slight danger.

Though the sense of danger wasn't intense, it was indeed threatening.

"What is this thing?" Su Nantian said he had never seen it. Whether in the cultivation world or on Earth, he had encountered many things, but this round ball was beyond his knowledge.

Seeming to take pleasure in Su Nantian's bewilderment, Wu Jialao boasted: "This is our family's latest achievement. We used cultivation techniques to refine materials and create high-power explosives, making hand grenades that can be triggered by spiritual awareness. Their power is terrifying!

Boy, you're about to be blown into pieces! It's a great honor for you to die by my latest invention!"

Su Nantian frowned, begrudgingly admitting the old man had some ideas.

He never thought hand grenades could be used this way, almost resembling cultivation's lightning techniques.

After all, the art of refining thunder pearls was long lost in the cultivation world. Now, most lightning techniques were five-element divine lightning, different from those legendary thunder pearls.

After Wu Jialao explained for a while, he suddenly felt something was off. Why hadn't his thrown grenades exploded yet?

Moreover, he couldn't sense their presence anymore!

"What did you do?"

He quickly pulled out another handful and threatened Su Nantian.

But it was not Su Nantian who answered, but Su Yujian. A figure stepped out from the shadows just in front of Su Nantian, facing Wu Jialao.

At this moment, the sword hanging at his waist finally unsheathed. Its color was like fine jade—deep green yet with a fierce, world-destroying sharpness.

At this moment, the sword's锋芒 (sharpness) was fully revealed!

"You!"

Seeing Su Yujian step out, Wu Jialao was stunned. He seemed confused why this helpful friend had suddenly turned against him.

"Hmph, I should have known you two were in cahoots! No need to talk more. Attack!"

Wu Jialao's beads one after another descended upon Su Nantian and Su Yujian!

At his cultivation level five, even a small stone thrown could be formidable. How much more so with these newly developed explosives, which he was amazed by.

Chapter 104: Broadcast

Yet it proved useless. Su Yujian stood alone, his sword moving as if an extension of his arm. His every move and strike precisely cut through the beads Wu Jialao had thrown!

Su Yujian's essence was a golden body formed by countless faiths. His flesh and the sword in his hand were all made of faith power!

Even different from the pure spiritual energy absorbed by Su Nantian, this power also contained countless beings' desires and thoughts.

So when Su Yujian's sword cut through these beads, the spiritual energy within immediately became chaotic. Explosion was no longer easy.

Seeing he couldn't even deal with one person, and there was another who seemed not bad either!

Wu Jialao knew if he stayed here, it wouldn't end well. He turned and fled, rapidly activating his flying artifact.

After all, the strength of his inner energy could not sustain this for long. He was most afraid of accidentally falling and being left behind.

But actually, Su Nantian had no intention to keep him. First, there was no need to settle old grudges; second, with the flying artifact, he himself might not even be able to catch him.

"Thank you, good sir!"

Seeing the enemy disappear, Su Yujian bowed and gave a serious expression.

"Go away!"

But he received only these two words. Su Yujian scolded him with a smile and then instantly vanished in a flash of light.

Su Nantian knew he had returned to the shrine at Fengyue Community.

At this moment, Su Nantian felt a bit envious of Su Yujian. A divine body was really convenient; at least he didn't need to take a vehicle back.

The death raven, after calling twice, quickly shrank in size, becoming about the size of a fist and landing on Su Nantian's shoulder.

Though they had signed an equal contract, their fates were now intertwined.

Returning from the western suburbs, Su Nantian found that Su Yujian was indeed already in the shrine.

As soon as he entered the house, he noticed Gao Jingjing and Lin Suyun were both out. Lin Suyun was probably managing the company affairs of the Lin family.

Bored, Su Nantian suddenly remembered something. He had participated in a variety show a few days ago, and it was supposed to air today.

"I Love the Voice," a phenomenon-level music variety show. Of course, this so-called phenomenon was only in areas like Fengcheng and Jiangzhou.

But even so, the fan base was considerable.

Su Nantian opened his computer and searched for "I Love the Voice" to find the latest episode immediately.

"Let's cool down, thank you for being here. This is a large-scale variety show sponsored by Cool Fans," the host Zhang Gang said.

"Welcome to watch, I am the host of this episode, Zhang Gang!"

As Zhang Gang's familiar voice played, the program began. The comments started to flood in quickly.

"Host Zhang Gang's show is still so interesting!"

"Loving Zhang Gang..."

"First, confetti..."

...

Su Nantian watched the program with comments enabled, mainly to know what netizens thought of him. After all, it affected his fan growth and indirectly influenced his strength.

It didn't take long before Su Nantian's turn came. As dry ice mist rose on the stage, and he stood motionless with his lower body still, gliding like clouds, the comments exploded instantly!

They split into three categories. One was Su Nantian's fans, who commented: "Wow, so handsome! I want to have a baby with you!"

"Chivalrous prince in the world of filth!"

"I love you! Keep going!"

...

The second category were Su Nantian's haters, who uniformly commented: "Show-off, show-off king!"

The third category were the indifferent netizens. Some gasped, some praised, and others studied where Su Nantian's wire was hung.

Whether from the live audience or comments, Su Nantian felt the reaction was really good. At least he could sense that the faith power connected to Su Yujian was continuously increasing, meaning he would soon experience another peak in his cultivation.

When Su Nantian sat on the clouds and played the zither with empty hands, everyone went crazy!

"Wow! Cool! Amazing!"

"666... 999... 6 is flipped!"

...

Su Nantian felt another wave of faith power coming toward him, making his mouth unable to close.

"What are you laughing at alone?" A familiar voice said. Su Nantian didn't need to turn around to know who was speaking behind him.

As family knew family, no one understood Su Yujian better than Su Nantian. He deeply knew that although this guy looked calm on the surface, his inner self was also excited. It could be said he was a typical quiet flirt. Compared to Su Nantian, this kind of "innocent" kid was the most annoying.

No need to say much. They both sat down... Well, actually, one person sat together in front of the computer watching the variety show. Occasionally they exchanged a few words.

Just then, a door opened. Lin Suyun asked from outside: "Nantian brother, who came to our house? Are you chatting with someone?"

Su Nantian was about to speak, but when he turned around, he found Su Yujian had disappeared again. On his shoulder was only a lonely raven.

"Uh, wife, I'm talking to Ba Ba!" He said. "Look, this is a parrot I bought at the bird market this morning. It turned out to be an idiot, and it still couldn't speak after I taught it all morning!"

Lin Suyun glanced at the death raven held in Su Nantian's palm, and a look of interest appeared on her face.

"Wow, such a majestic parrot!" She quickly took it and hugged it.

To be honest, the death raven's reduced size did resemble a parrot. It was no problem to fool Lin Suyun, an outsider.

But just then, those red ruby-like eyes seemed to send Su Nantian a glance. And for some reason, Su Nantian understood it. The meaning of that glance was clearly: "You shameless guy, letting this raven help you. If I don't get good food, I'll expose you!"

Chapter 105: Wu Family's Young Master

Everything unfolded as Su Nantian had anticipated. After this episode of "I Love the Voice" aired, the name of Su Nantian—Chivalrous Prince and Divine Youth—became well-known!

Previously, Su Nantian had some fame online but was more of a net celebrity.

Now, his微博 (Weibo) followers had exceeded 2 million. Though it wasn't a big star, he had entered the ranks of minor celebrities.

Su Nantian naturally welcomed this. With the program's broadcast, countless faith powers continuously flowed toward him. Fortunately, he had already allocated Su Yujian as a divine body split. Otherwise, the massive influx of faith power would have been a huge pressure on him.

But one thing surprised Su Nantian: the faith power required for divine cultivation was truly massive!

Originally, he had felt resource depletion and couldn't keep up with his cultivation speed. Now, with the limited resources needing to be shared between two people, it was even more of a burden.

Although he had harvested a large amount of faith power through this, he hadn't expected Su Yujian's consumption of faith power to be a real gold-guzzling beast, quite terrifying.

The massive influx of faith power from the TV program was absorbed by Su Yujian up to eight levels, yet he still complained it wasn't enough daily. Meanwhile, Su Nantian could only get the remaining two levels—truly tight.

But under the refining of countless faith powers, Su Yujian's sword was even more dazzling. Even Su Nantian himself felt a bit intimidated when facing this sword.

According to Su Yujian's explanation, although the divine body could absorb faith power without refinement, it couldn't absorb the desires and thoughts mixed within those countless faiths. This was a poison that no being with its own mind could resist.

After all, when countless thoughts and various words filled his mind, he was close to madness.

The method of refining the divine body required gathering these desires. In fact, Su Yujian's sword was formed by countless fans' various selfish thoughts.

If placed in the cultivation world, these myriad beings' thoughts were called "the roaring red dust."

It could be said that for cultivators, this red dust was the most toxic. For Su Nantian, this six-sided Han sword was definitely a weapon to exterminate demons and evil spirits.

Now that Su Yujian had separated, it was impossible to retrieve. Su Nantian could only grit his teeth and accept it. After all, no matter what, the growth was still his strength.

Not to mention Su Nantian's annoyance, Wu Jialao also felt郁闷 (depressed) upon returning to the hotel.

He had thought this was a simple task, but it turned out he messed it up so easily. Especially those two meddling little pests who ruined his big plan!

But the incident had already happened, and Wu Jialao couldn't even think of escaping or denying it.

He took out his phone and dialed a number he would never forget in his life.

"How did it go?"

The phone just connected, and before Wu Jialao could speak, the other side already responded with a cold voice.

"Master... I..."

"What's going on?"

Although Wu Jialao felt resentful being called a "waste" by this young man, he dared not resist. He knew that anyone with even a hint of resistance in the Wu family had already been buried for two zhang (approx. 6 meters) high.

"I... I..." Wu Jialao's voice trembled as he spoke. "I've tracked the death raven to the western suburbs of Fengcheng and was about to kill it and bring it back for you. But I didn't expect two twins to appear!"

"These twins, each of them has a cultivation level comparable to mine. They teamed up and took the death raven, leaving me severely injured."

"Now I've found their hideout. Please send more people to retrieve the target."

Wu Jialao quickly said everything he wanted to say, then waited for a long time. He didn't know whether this capricious master would let him off or what he should do next.

"What about the twins? I haven't heard of them before... Do you know which family they belong to?"

The master's voice was slightly contemplative but yielded no results. He had never heard of any young pair in the cultivation world with such high-level twins.

"Master, they said they were from the Lin family in Fengcheng."

After Wu Jialao's words, the Wu family's young master paused for a while before his voice came through: "My dear uncle, you know I deal with those who deceive me. According to what I know, there's no cultivation family named Lin in Fengcheng. The only Lin family is a secular business group."

Hearing the master's words, Wu Jialao's head broke out in sweat. He quickly said to the phone: "Master... I dare not deceive you! I've found their address, in Fengyue Community. You send people over to check and you'll know!"

After hearing Wu Jialao's words, the Wu family's young master thought it was indeed so. After all, that old man wouldn't dare deceive him; he knew his methods.

At this point, there was no more to say. He hung up the phone.

At that moment, in Hezhou's Wu family mansion.

A boy around sixteen or seventeen years old sat at the core of the Wu family's hall. After putting down his phone, his eyes—originally cruel and arrogant—became calm and carried a touch of dusk.

"Cough, cough. My dear grandson, you did well!

As long as the death raven is retrieved and its body that combines death qi and vitality is consumed, Grandpa can reverse yin and yang to regain youth. I won't need your help anymore."

Although this boy was only around sixteen or seventeen, the voice that came from his mouth was hoarse and old, as if a monster's soul was hidden beneath this young body.

As the dusk in his eyes faded, the bloodthirsty sharpness and arrogance of a boy reappeared!

But no one knew when his lips were bitten bloody.

"Rest assured, my dear grandpa!" These words seemed to come out one by one from his throat...

Chapter 106: Each with Their Own Designs

At that moment, the boy wasn't alone in the Wu family's hall. In fact, all the elders and heads of various branches who could speak in the Wu family were sitting there.

But hearing this strange conversation, no one dared to speak. It was as if everyone had chosen deafness and heard nothing.

In fact, the Wu family did have people who dared to speak. But those who dared to speak were already dead. The rest naturally didn't dare to speak.

The two strange conversations continued...

"Hahahaha, my dear grandson, Grandpa knows you're not satisfied. But what can you do? If you can't help Grandpa reverse yin and yang, then your current body will be a companion for Grandpa!

Ahahaha... Don't feel resentful. Didn't you actively ask me to help you before?"

The old voice echoed in the hall, but no one answered...

After a long time, the atmosphere in the hall gradually warmed up.

"Sixth elder, tomorrow you and Fourth Elder should take the shadow team to go. The head of the family reported that the enemy was quite formidable, their cultivation level not weak. Now the death raven is in his hands, which is definitely not good for us.

Also, it's uncertain whether the so-called Fengcheng Lin family has other cultivators. So please be careful.

The head of the family has already found the enemy's trail, and when you meet him, you'll attack together.

Although his cultivation level is a bit low, the power of those lightning beads is still considerable.

Everyone, Grandpa's madness has made him no longer the same Grandpa. If he returns, what will happen is something you can guess.

Now he's half-dead and half-alive, between yin and yang. The death raven can either let him turn from death to life or from life to death. Whether it's used for what, it's all up to your decision!"

At this moment, the Wu family's young master showed a killing intent. The hall that had just warmed up froze again!

Compared to his grandfather's reckless behavior, the Wu family's young master still needed support from these family members. So his display of power was just a brief burst.

But for those present in the hall, whether it was the Wu family's young master or that half-dead old man, they were all terrifying beings of cruelty and inhumanity!

In their hearts, the greatest hope was that these two monsters would fight to mutual destruction and die.

As for the death raven, it was best if they could retrieve it. Using it on themselves would be great.

If they couldn't retrieve it, it didn't matter. But don't get into a conflict with another powerful faction.

Some people had already thought about using this opportunity to go out for two days, hoping to delay as long as possible.

The most tense moment between this old and young monster was coming in the next few days. Once they fought to mutual destruction, it would be time for them to come and take advantage.

People eat different kinds of rice, so they have different thoughts. At this moment, the people in this hall perfectly embodied what it meant to have their own hidden agendas.

But no matter what, surface work still needed to be done.

"Yes, we will do our best!" The sixth elder and fourth elder, who were called by name, bowed their heads and bent over to salute the youth. They looked like innocent people.

As for what they really thought, only they themselves knew.

Su Nantian didn't know he had been targeted by this not-so-small cultivation family. At that moment, he was out shopping with Lin Suyun, Gao Jingjing, and Yao Lina.

It was said to be a weekend, so Yao Lina had time off. Lin Suyun took her out for fun. After all, Su Nantian didn't know it; in the world of a shut-in, every day was a weekend.

It was said that three women equaled 500 ducks. Now Su Nantian was the one who herded them. The only thing he needed to do was pay, carry things, and follow behind obediently.

Fortunately, he could secretly put the items into his storage ring when no one was looking, so he didn't have to carry them all.

On his shoulder, the death raven turned its pair of red ruby-like eyes and looked around.

Born in the wild, with a short life spent fleeing, it had never experienced the hustle and bustle of a big city. Now it was dazzled and didn't know what to choose.

Behind them, about 200 meters away, an old man in a flowered shirt and shorts walked slowly. He had a big gold chain around his neck and wore sunglasses. No matter how he looked, he wasn't a good person. But it was different from his usual appearance, showing a completely different atmosphere.

This old man wasn't anyone else but Wu Jialao, the head of the Wu family in Hezhou.

The old man had some skills. Since yesterday, he had been staying in a house near Fengyue Community to observe Su Nantian's situation.

Although Su Nantian had sharp spiritual awareness and could sense someone following him, in this busy market with people everywhere, he didn't pay much attention.

This old man was very jealous of this kid. Not only did he have two high-quality beauties with him at home, but he also had another one accompanying him every day. How could he not be worried about exhausting himself? Young people, you don't know how to control yourself...

But Wu Jialao found it strange that the one with the blue robe and sword hadn't come back since yesterday. This made Wu Jialao a bit surprised.

Strictly speaking, Wu Jialao was quite wary of Su Yujian. As for Su Nantian, since he hadn't seen him fight before, Wu Jialao didn't feel much fear.

That sharp sword was not only extremely sharp but could also cut through arrays and disrupt spiritual awareness. It left a deep impression on him.

After some time, Wu Jialao's phone vibrated slightly. He moved a little and gave up tracking Su Nantian, heading instead to a nearby small shop.

"Boss, stir-fry lung slices, slip on fat intestines, and some kidney!"

Seeing the shop, Wu Jialao didn't hesitate. He quickly ordered a few small dishes and sat down to wait.

After a while, the several dishes Wu Jialao ordered were brought out. The old man sat there, smelling the aroma and looking very happy. He also ordered two taels of small wine and drank it himself.

"Big brother, I finally found you!"

Just as Wu Jialao was halfway through his drink, two voices came from beside him.

Wu Jialao looked up and saw it was his fourth and sixth elder brothers arriving.

"What? You sent the two of you this time? Did you eat yet? Want to sit down and have something?"

Chapter 107: Evening Benefits

"Did you eat yet? If not, sit down and have something!"

Seeing his fourth and sixth elder brothers arrive, Wu Jialao was happy. The Wu family in Hezhou was no longer the one he remembered.

The harmonious and kind family of his parents could only exist in his memories!

Wu Jialao had resentment, but what could he do? His cultivation level was insufficient and his strength weak. The Wu family had no place for him to speak.

Although he held the title of head elder, how many people truly regarded him as such?

He knew these things but didn't want to say them. Today, after drinking two taels of small wine, he felt unusually excited. After all, his fourth and sixth elder brothers were still his own brothers.

The fourth and sixth elders had arrived in Fengcheng with the shadow troops. They were indeed a bit hungry. But looking at Wu Jialao's dining environment and the dishes on the table made of internal organs, they felt a bit nauseous. They didn't even want to pick up their chopsticks.

Compared to Wu Jialao, they had received the high education of the Wu family since childhood. They had never been to such a dirty and messy small shop, let alone eat food made from internal organs.

They looked at each other, feeling awkward. No one moved their chopsticks. Wu Jialao knew what they were thinking but didn't care, eating more happily himself.

He not only ate two bowls of rice but also drank two taels of small wine. Then he discussed with the two of them.

"The so-called Fengcheng Lin family, I didn't find any cultivation family. But those twins definitely had great abilities. They were about level six of cultivation, slightly higher than you two. Plus there was the death raven, that cursed creature. Even if we three fought together, it might not be enough to win.

Also, the security outside Fengyue Community was quite tight now. Their guards were no worse than our shadows.

So, to complete the mission, we need a long-term plan."

Hearing Wu Jialao's words, the fourth and sixth elders exchanged glances and nodded slightly in agreement with their elder brother's opinion. They had already decided to drag it out.

No matter which old ghost or young ghost was in power, the Wu family wouldn't have a good time. Only when they fought to mutual destruction would there be hope.

"Today I tracked him all day and found that one of the little bastards had a lot of luck. He had three girlfriends!

What if we..."

Although Wu Jialao didn't finish his sentence, the fourth and sixth elders understood what he meant.

It was indeed a good idea!

Su Nantian didn't know he had become someone's target. He spent the day shopping with three women, and even with his level six steel body, he was exhausted.

Walking on the street with three beautiful women by his side, how many old men and boys cast envious glances. But who could understand the pain and bitterness?

Tired, truly tired! Whether it was day or night!

Sometimes Su Nantian even felt like calling Su Yujian to help... after all, it was himself!

Would he get double the happiness?

Returning home, Su Nantian threw himself onto the bed, with no strength left in his body.

Thinking back to shopping, Lin Suyun had bought so much food. She was probably planning to cook dinner for him!

Wait and see, I'll lie here dead today. Even if the bed shook, I wouldn't move!
