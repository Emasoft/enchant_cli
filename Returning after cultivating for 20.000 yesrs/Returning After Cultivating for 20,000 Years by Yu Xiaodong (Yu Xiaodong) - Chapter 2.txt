“Huiyunju” was a restaurant specializing in traditional Chinese elegance. Upon entering, there was an artificial small pond with rock formations and birds, while the sound of clear, crisp zither and lute harmonies echoed in the ears.

As he passed by one of the guqin players, Su Nantian hesitated but ultimately stopped.

“You made several mistakes in your playing just now.”
The music paused.

The woman, who was playing the guqin, frowned and looked up unhappily.
“Do you know that some things shouldn’t be said carelessly? Don’t try to draw my attention by making up nonsense. Even if you’re good-looking, this behavior is bad and won’t make me like you. Give up.”
Her voice was soft but carried a firm tone.

Su Nantian, “?”
What the hell?
He was merely annoyed by her terrible playing, worse than that of his lowly servants. He had only intended to point out the errors but was met with hostility instead.
How did he become a lecherous flirt? This woman must be insane.

“Exactly, where did this brat come from? Dressed so oddly, running around to show off?”
“Get out. If you don’t want to listen, stop disturbing us.”
“This refined art isn’t something a brat like you can understand. Stop causing trouble.”
“Boy, move aside. It’s embarrassing.”

The surrounding diners all started talking to Su Nantian, none of them found him appealing. Many were men who had come specifically for Wu Lianxing; seeing Su Nantian, far more handsome than them, was like a thorn in their eyes.

“Nantian… let’s go.”
Lin Suyun, embarrassed, approached Su Nantian and tugged his sleeve.

“First, you really played wrong. Second, I can’t even look at your kind.”
Su Nantian’s face remained cold as he looked down at the woman sitting on a stool.
After saying this, he flicked his robe and prepared to leave.

“Stand still! With such arrogant words, do you think you can just walk away? A man?”
Wu Lianxing frowned and set down her guqin. She was truly angry at this brash little man.

“Oh?”
Su Nantian raised an eyebrow. “Then what do you want to do?”

“You said I made mistakes just now. You must understand music theory, right? Why don’t you play and give me some guidance?”
Wu Lianxing raised her eyebrows, teasingly. She stood up and gestured for Su Nantian to proceed.

This was clearly an attempt to humiliate him, to trap him in a dilemma.
“Nantian, let’s go…”
Lin Suyun watched the two clashing and felt a headache. Su Nantian had never learned guqin before; even during high school, he could ask whether sheet music was edible.
Even if he had learned it after university, how could he compare to someone who had studied it since childhood?
Moreover, she suspected Su Nantian was just trying to flirt with the woman because of her beauty.
This made her both angry and amused, and she felt pity for Su Nantian under the crowd’s verbal attacks. She wanted to leave quickly before he was humiliated.

Su Nantian glanced at Lin Suyun, his lips curling slightly. If it were the old him, he would have truly refused. But now, in the cultivation world, he had a title—“Qin Demon” (琴魔).

He patted Lin Suyun’s hand. “Don’t worry, I’ll be back soon.”

Chapter Five: A Single Melody That Shocked the World

With a flick of his sleeve, his robe fluttered.
His tall and imposing figure, cascading long hair, and handsome face earned him many female supporters in the restaurant, who clutched their hearts.

Wu Lianxing was surprised, not expecting him to actually dare. Was it confidence or recklessness?

Su Nantian had no patience for this self-obsessed woman. He walked straight to the seat and sat down, his long, pale fingers brushing over the guqin. He listened carefully, sensing its tone.

“Why haven’t you started playing yet?”
Wu Lianxing, seeing his pretentious manner, was certain he was stalling.

“You! Don’t touch my guqin!”
Wu Lianxing panicked, thinking this fool would ruin her instrument. She rushed over but was too late; she watched in horror as the stranger’s hands moved so fast they were a blur across the guqin.

“You bastard!”
Wu Lianxing was so angry she almost cried.

“Don’t panic. Now listen again and see if I lied.”
Su Nantian gave her a cold glance, unbothered. His pale, long fingers brushed over the guqin.

The clear sound stunned Wu Lianxing; even her angry curses were swallowed.
She was speechless.
This… was a feeling she had never heard before!

Wu Lianxing covered her mouth, her emotions mixed. Had she been wrong?
Her pride refused to admit it.
But the sound was clearly better than before. How could she have failed to notice her guqin wasn’t tuned properly?
Her guilt and embarrassment flushed her face.

“Alright, it’s about ready now.”
Su Nantian nodded in satisfaction.
“You played *Xiaoxiang Shuiyun* before, so I’ll play this piece too.”
Su Nantian adjusted his sleeves and calmly said, “Xiaoxiang Shuiyun consists of ten movements: *Dongting Mist and Rain*, *Jianghan’s Clear Breeze*, *Heavenly Light and Clouds*, *Water Meets the Horizon*, *Waves Swirl with Clouds*, *Wind Rises and Clouds Surge*, *Water and Sky in Harmony*, *Cold River Moonlight*, *Ten Thousand Miles of Clear Waves*, *Reflections Containing All Things*. The errors you made were in the fourth movement’s low notes and the eighth movement’s transition, and…”

He spoke calmly, without contention.
Su Nantian now sat on a high platform, his face like a painting, head lowered as he played the guqin. Wu Lianxing no longer dared to ignore his words after tuning the instrument.
This was truly a person with talent!
The master’s teachings were rare, and Wu Lianxing had already elevated Su Nantian to a teacher’s status. She listened respectfully, taking notes carefully.

When Wu Lianxing heard his suggestions, she took out her phone to record it, determined not to miss anything.
Lin Suyun was also stunned by Su Nantian’s performance. Since their meeting, he had continually surprised her.
She thought that was all he could do—until the next moment shattered her assumptions!

Seeing the guqin player recording, Lin Suyun also took out her phone and started filming.
“The correct way to play is like this, listen carefully!”
Su Nantian’s eyes narrowed. His long, pale fingers stretched over the guqin. He was silent for a moment before—

*Plink, plink… plink, plink…*
A continuous and smooth melody drifted through the restaurant.

“Ugh, I can’t stand this brat’s show-off attitude.”
“Don’t be jealous. If you don’t want to listen, just leave.”
“Be quiet. This kid actually plays better than Wu’s performance…”
“He’s so handsome and can play the guqin. Is he a god? Sisters, come see my husband perform!”
“Sister, you’re flirting with your legs. Please control yourself…”

Initially, only a few people spoke in the restaurant, but soon, everyone fell silent. Some closed their eyes in rapture; others stared intently at the man in an elaborate robe, his beauty almost ethereal.

The commotion inside the restaurant gradually caught the attention of passersby outside, and more people flooded in. Eventually, even the entrance was overcrowded, with people crowding at the windows along the street. Yet everyone remained silent, listening quietly and recording without a sound.

When the melody ended, the crowd still lingered in the atmosphere it had created.
After a long silence, Wu Lianxing’s eyes flashed with admiration.
The guqin performance had skillfully used the techniques of *yin, nao, chuo, zhu*, embodying the guqin’s “clear, subtle, quiet, and distant” beauty. This level of technique she had only seen in her teacher!

*Clap, clap, clap!*
After Wu Lianxing clapped, everyone seemed to awaken from a dream. The entire restaurant erupted in applause!

Su Nantian stood up, intending to leave.
But—
“Another one! Another one!”
“Another one! It was so good, mom, this is a god playing the guqin!”
“This restaurant’s pianist quality is too high. So handsome, and his skills rival a music professor. Is this a dream? I’ll definitely come every day!”
“Uh, he’s actually a guest, not one of the restaurant’s pianists.”
“What’s going on?”
“It was like this… and that…”

The crowd clamored for another performance. Those unaware of the situation learned what had happened through word-of-mouth.

The restaurant manager was already alarmed and waited nearby. Seeing Su Nantian stand up, he hurried over with a polite bow.
“Sir, would you be interested in working here? I guarantee a monthly salary of five thousand yuan. You don’t need to come every day—just on weekends or during major events.”

“Five thousand!”
Many people nearby gasped.
Lin Suyun was also stunned, recalling Su Nantian’s earlier claim that he made money easily. She had thought it was just his bravado, but now it seemed earning money was truly effortless for him.

When everyone expected Su Nantian to accept,
“No, thank you. My path isn’t here.”
Su Nantian’s face remained calm. Five thousand was nothing to him; his refusal was as casual as dismissing five yuan.

“That’s a shame.”
The manager looked disappointed. If they could hire this god, it would definitely become the restaurant’s pillar of support and elevate Huiyunju to the city’s top dining spot.
Five thousand seemed high, but for this upscale restaurant, it was just a drop in the bucket once fame and traffic were secured.

“Please accept this VIP card. You can eat here for free with it.”

Chapter Six: The VIP Card

The manager still refused to give up, devising another plan. He had to connect with such talent—though he was currently unknown, he would definitely become a dragon among men in the future.
As long as he came, there would be more opportunities to connect later.

“Alright, thank you, sir.”
Su Nantian hesitated but accepted the black and gold card. It wasn’t a bad move for him.
As an immortal elder who had lived two thousand years, he understood the manager’s intentions perfectly. But he didn’t mind; mutual exploitation was friendship. For now, with no money, it might be a help in the future.

Among the crowd, many people saw the black and gold card and narrowed their eyes. Huiyunju’s black and gold cards weren’t easy to obtain—they were almost equivalent to a proof of upper-class status!

While they chatted, someone in the crowd realized who the man was.
“Han Chege!”
“Chu Shi Jia Gongzi!”
“A god!”

“Husband, husband! I want to have a baby with you!”
“Ah, don’t push me. You’re squeezing water out of me!”
“Let go! Give me a chance to see my husband up close—”
“Spit it out, you’re mine!”
“Let him go! Let me—”

Outside the restaurant.
A limousine pulled up by the roadside.
The door opened, and a young man in a hoodie, mask, and sunglasses stepped out with several attendants.
“Yingzai, we’ve arrived at Huiyunju.”
The young man glanced at the crowd blocking the street, frowning slightly. He scolded his assistant without hesitation.
“What’s going on? I told you to be low-key and not make such a big scene! Who leaked the information? Can’t you even do this right? Did you grow up eating dirt?”
The assistant lowered his head, too afraid to argue with the rising star Ying Longtai’s scolding.

Ying Longtai spoke like that, but he was actually happy about the many fans coming to support him. This showed his potential to the company!
Feigning helplessness, Ying Longtai greeted the surrounding security staff and waved to the crowd by the roadside.
“Hey, my fans! Hello! I’ve received your support!”
Ying Longtai forced a smile, waiting for the fans’ screams.

But—
One second, two seconds… one minute… they ignored him completely, only pushing into the restaurant.
Only a few people at the front turned their heads briefly.
“Who is that guy? Why’s he waving like a nut?”
“That’s right, dressed like that. Thinking he’s a star? Idiot!”

Murmurs from the crowd made Ying Longtai’s face darken.
*Crack, crack, crack…*
A crow flew overhead. Ying Longtai’s hand, raised awkwardly, felt stuck between leaving it up or down.

At the same time, Su Nantian, after accepting the black and gold card, looked around. This meal was clearly not going to happen; he was surrounded by layers of people.
“We should go.”
Su Nantian gently took Lin Suyun’s hand, apologizing.

At this moment, Lin Suyun truly felt a thousand arrows piercing her heart. The women around her glared at her as if they wanted to devour her. She followed Su Nantian obediently, occasionally glancing at his broad back with a secret smile.

“Hey, can I have your contact information? I want to discuss guqin techniques with you.”
Wu Lianxing hesitated for a long time. She had hoped he would initiate contact, but seeing him about to leave, she realized his words might have truly meant nothing. She swallowed her embarrassment and approached him.

“No, thank you. Please move aside.”
Su Nantian glanced at her coldly and spoke.
Wu Lianxing’s face turned pale. This was the first time she had actively asked a boy for contact details, and it ended in rejection.

The crowd gasped.
As Su Nantian was about to leave the restaurant, he paused and looked back at the woman standing frozen. He coldly parted his lips.
“Not everyone will flatter you because of your beauty. Beauty? I have it too. I don’t care.”

The entire restaurant was drowned in the screams of women.

Outside, Ying Longtai, still raising his hand awkwardly, heard the screams and slightly relaxed.
“You see, they probably didn’t recognize me. After all, I’ve always worn a mask and sunglasses. Now… ah, don’t push me!”

As Ying Longtai tried to explain, the crowd surged forward. He was pushed far away and fell to the ground, his clothes messy and face dirty like a beggar.

The “fans” rushed after the man in an elaborate robe, leaving Ying Longtai trembling and confused.

In the car, the two exchanged a bitter smile.
“Men are really trouble. All because of you, I’m starving and can’t eat.”
Lin Suyun rubbed her stomach and complained.

“Hey, how about I cook for you?”
Su Nantian suggested seriously.

“…”
“…”
The car fell into an awkward silence. Both realized their words had a double meaning…

What did she mean by “making me starve to death”? What did he mean by “cooking for you”?

“I actually meant noodles…”
Su Nantian scratched his head.

“Okay, don’t say it. You’re just making it worse.”
Lin Suyun blushed and turned her head away, avoiding eye contact.
Her heart was pounding wildly. This idiot was getting more and more tempting.

The car fell silent again.
This tension wasn’t helpful. Lin Suyun secretly turned her head and saw Su Nantian was also smiling at the window, looking nostalgic.
He hadn’t even considered the atmosphere!
Lin Suyun covered her face, thinking he was still a呆子 (dumbass) from high school.

“Hey, maybe we should buy clothes first and then go to the supermarket to get some ingredients.”
Lin Suyun combed through her hair for the hundredth time, trying to stay calm.

“Okay, whatever you say.”
Su Nantian smiled slightly, his small cleverness evident. He turned back to face Lin Suyun with the same calm expression, as if he didn’t care about anything.

The clothes shopping was smooth. If there was any incident, it might be because Su Nantian’s physique and appearance were so good that no matter what he wore, it left the store staff and passersby in awe.

After buying discounted vegetables and meat at the supermarket, they returned to the villa around six in the evening.

Chapter Seven: You Secretly Kept a Good Man for Yourself!

“Nantian, my friend called and said she’s coming over tonight. She just got off work and hasn’t eaten… umm, should we order takeout or I’ll cook?”
Lin Suyun peeked out from the kitchen door, hesitantly.

“Do you think I’m not good enough?”
Su Nantian, washing vegetables, glanced back at her.

“No no no, I didn’t mean that.”
Lin Suyun smiled awkwardly. Well, she had thought that way in her heart… but now it was definitely not the time to admit it!
She had been happy when Su Nantian said he would cook, but if he made it terrible… she could lie to herself and say it was good. But if her friend came over and said it was bad, that would be awkward.
She didn’t want to discourage Su Nantian’s enthusiasm.

“Don’t overthink it. I just don’t want to eat something too bad.”
Su Nantian remained calm, seeing through her. “Not that I’m bragging, but if I say my cooking level is second, no one would dare to claim first.”

“Huh? You’ve gotten so thick-skinned these years. Your self-praise is too childish.”
Lin Suyun was speechless.

“…”
Su Nantian also felt headache, why didn’t she believe him?

“Speaking of which, she’s already at the door. I’ll go open it.”
Lin Suyun was about to say something when her phone buzzed. She glanced at the WeChat message and sighed helplessly.

“Go on, go on. Don’t disturb me while I cook.”
Su Nantian waved his hand without looking back, continuing to wash the vegetables and arranging them neatly on a cutting board.

At the door.
“Suyun, I missed you!”
The door barely opened when Yao Lina rushed in, tossing her bag aside and hugging Lin Suyun. She suddenly sniffed the air.
“Wait, you have a man’s scent! Tell me, did you secretly cheat on me?”

Yao Lina scowled.
“No, I don’t have a nose like a dog. I didn’t. Don’t say nonsense. Do I need to secretly cheat on you? Spit it out, I don’t cheat!”
Lin Suyun rolled her eyes. Before she could say more, Yao Lina’s eyes darted and ears twitched.
“Is Chen Ma cooking tonight?”
She licked her lips, as if savoring the memory.

“Uh… no…”
Lin Suyun was still trying to explain, but Yao Lina rushed into the kitchen.
“Wait for me.”
Lin Suyun sighed and chased after her.

When they reached the kitchen door, Su Nantian had just arranged the ingredients.
With a flick of his right hand, he grabbed a knife and performed a dazzling blade flourish. The white light flashed.
*Smack!*
Then his left hand slammed the cutting board, sending the ingredients flying.

“Ah, it’s falling—!”
Yao Lina gasped.
But the next moment, she swallowed her scream.

The tall and imposing figure in the kitchen swiftly moved his right hand, almost a blur. *Shua shua shua!*
When Yao Lina and Lin Suyun blinked, the ingredients were neatly arranged on the cutting board.

“Uh? Did anything happen?”
Yao Lina was confused, turning to Lin Suyun.

“I don’t think so. The ingredients seem unchanged. I said his cooking was bad… uh…”
Lin Suyun was stunned, speechless. How could this happen? Why was Su Nantian so good at cooking?
Even if she wanted to deny his culinary skills, the aroma in the air and her saliva secreted by her mouth, along with her growling stomach, wouldn’t let her lie.

“Enough. Go wash your hands and get ready to eat.”
Su Nantian turned off the stove, smiled gently. He had noticed the two sneaking around the kitchen door but didn’t mind; it wouldn’t affect him.
In the cultivation world, he had long since fasted, but after battles and training, cooking became a way to pass the time. He had learned from various famous chefs, gradually mastering his current high level.

The overwhelming masculine aura and warm, gentle demeanor of Su Nantian were strangely mixed.
Yao Lina faced Su Nantian’s smile, her breath caught in her throat. Her heart skipped a beat, and she blushed, quickly grabbing Lin Suyun’s hand to run toward the bathroom.

In the bathroom.
“Ugh, he’s too handsome… Suyun! You’re so unfair, hiding a good man to enjoy secretly!”
Yao Lina covered her red face.

“…”
Lin Suyun rolled her eyes. “You idiot, what are you talking about? How could I secretly enjoy a good man! I didn’t even enjoy it!”

“Hey, I meant enjoying his cooking. Suyun, why are you blushing? Tell me the truth, did you misunderstand something!”
Yao Lina teased.

“Spit it out! You’re the one who misunderstood, and your face is red too!”
Lin Suyun turned her head awkwardly. She had actually imagined herself being pressed under Su Nantian…
It was embarrassing and heart-racing.

“What? Do you not like this big handsome guy? If you don’t, I’ll take him!”
Yao Lina seemed to be joking, but her expression revealed a hint of seriousness.

“I…”
Lin Suyun wanted to instinctively say she didn’t like him, but thinking of losing Su Nantian made her heart ache. She quickly changed her mind.
“I like him, okay?”

“Ha ha ha, yippee!”
Yao Lina’s pupils darkened slightly. She felt her underpants get wet, but seeing Lin Suyun’s expression made her realize it was better not to interfere. She forced a light-hearted tease instead.

“Hey, why are you taking so long to wash your hands? The food is getting cold!”
A voice from outside the bathroom.

“Coming, coming! What’s with the rush? Girls take longer to go to the bathroom!”
The two exchanged smiles, each lost in their thoughts. Lin Suyun responded from outside.

Chapter Eight: Someone Invited Me to a Show? Let Them Beg!

After dinner, Su Nantian returned to his room and thought about future plans. He then attempted meditation. No words were spoken that night.

The next day.
Dawn broke, and Su Nantian awoke from meditation. He opened his eyes and checked the time—just after five in the morning.

It was still early, so Su Nantian didn’t feel like sleeping. His meditation results were unsatisfactory; the earth’s qi was far thinner than he expected. Even the most barren places in the cultivation world were a hundred times better than Earth. One night of meditation, even with his immortal elder’s ability to absorb qi, had only reached the *Lianqi* (Refining Qi) stage.
To improve further would be difficult.
His *Nascent Soul* remained dormant, and his spiritual awareness couldn’t project outward. But he was still far better than ordinary people. He needed to find a solution. When he broke through the immortal elder stage, his soul was unstable, leading to failed thunder trials. He had thought he would die and lose everything, but the heavens gave him another chance.
This time, he must solidify his foundation and return to the cultivation world.

Thinking of this, Su Nantian’s eyes became more determined.
Two thousand years in the cultivation world, he had collected countless scrolls and reviewed them carefully. *The Qiankun Hui Ling诀 (乾坤汇灵诀)* was suitable—absorbing different sources of qi and converting them into the same type within his body, a kind of purification process.
This avoided mixed and impure qi while preventing unstable foundations.
The only problem was that few things contained qi.
Earth was vast, but there were still some. Su Nantian felt relieved. Otherwise, relying solely on Earth’s thin qi would take years to break through and return to the cultivation world.

One night of meditation was enough to keep him energetic without sleep.
He changed into the clothes on his bedside—simple patterned white T-shirt and loose shorts—and decided to go for a morning run.

An hour later, Su Nantian returned with soy milk and fried dough sticks. Lin Suyun and Yao Lina had just woken up.

As he entered, Su Nantian saw Yao Lina wearing a semi-transparent silk nightgown and yawning toward the bathroom. Her curves were clearly visible, with no undergarments to block it. The silk nightgown was short, barely covering her bottom.

“Su Nantian? Oh, good morning.”
Yao Lina, drowsy, waved at the door.

But when she turned around, it was directly facing Su Nantian.
The short nightgown barely concealed the triangular area beneath, with a playful black grass swaying in the wind.

“Ugh!”
Seeing Su Nantian staring at her, Yao Lina was startled. She followed his gaze and realized her attire.
Yao Lina instinctively gasped but remembered Lin Suyun was still in the room. She quickly covered her mouth.

Seeing Su Nantian still unashamedly looking at her, Yao Lina was furious and wanted to kill the bastard. She glared at him fiercely but ran toward the bathroom.

Unexpectedly, Su Nantian put down his breakfast and followed her into the bathroom before she could close it.

“What do you want!”
Yao Lina panicked and dodged, but she was just a young maiden. She had never experienced such a situation before. Being in the same bathroom with a man she barely knew for less than a day was unimaginable!

“Want!”
“…”
Yao Lina panicked. “Don’t do anything reckless! Suyun is still outside the room. If you do something, I’ll call out!”

“Joking. Actually…”
Su Nantian stopped smiling and seemed to say something, but Lin Suyun’s voice came from outside.

“Nantian? You’re back? There’s a call for you. It seems a TV station wants to invite you to appear. What should I say?”

“…”
Su Nantian sighed, feeling a headache. This timing was really inconvenient.

He signaled Yao Lina not to speak and called out, “Invite me to the show? Impossible. Let them come beg me!”

“What should I do now? How can I go out? It’s all your fault! Why did you follow me in here? How can I face Suyun…”
Yao Lina was anxious and frustrated, glaring at Su Nantian.

“Ah! Cockroach…”
Suddenly, Yao Lina pointed to a corner of the bathroom and screamed in fear. She hadn’t finished speaking when Su Nantian quickly covered her mouth.

Yao Lina realized the severity of the situation but was too scared by the cockroach to jump onto Su Nantian’s back, wrapping her arms around his neck and pressing herself against him.

*Click!*
The bathroom door opened, and Lin Suyun stared in shock at the scene—Yao Lina clinging to Su Nantian like a koala.

“You two better give me an explanation.”
Lin Suyun looked at Yao Lina and then Su Nantian, unable to believe the truth. Yesterday she had told Yao Lina she liked Su Nantian; today they were hugging. They were truly close sisters.

“Suyun, you misunderstood.”
As Yao Lina didn’t know how to explain, Su Nantian immediately spoke.

“Earlier when I came back, I heard a闷响 (muffled sound) from the bathroom. When I opened the door, I found Yao Lina on the floor with a twisted ankle. I massaged it for her, and she cried out in pain. But now it’s swollen and okay. She was about to leave.”

“Really?”
Lin Suyun doubted it.

“Really, Su Yun, that’s how it was. It was my fault.”
Yao Lina, hearing Su Nantian’s lie, quickly agreed. She was afraid Lin Suyun would misunderstand and stop being her sister.

Yao Lina’s face was already red from embarrassment.
“Okay, I believe you.”
Lin Suyun still didn’t fully trust them but used this excuse to comfort herself. This was the truth.

Su Nantian felt relieved after explaining and carried Yao Lina toward the room.
Seeing Yao Lina’s departure, Lin Suyun felt as if she had been struck by a heavy blow.
Deception!
Blatant deception!

Chapter Nine: She’s Sick

At this moment, Yao Lina’s silk nightgown could no longer hide the scene.
Su Nantian’s hands supported her thighs, barely a foot away from it. Yao Lina blushed even more, and her legs unconsciously clamped tighter.

A moment later, Su Nantian exited the room and was pulled aside by Lin Suyun.
“You really said all that.”
“Yes, I saw it. Actually, Yao Lina has a severe gynecological condition—*gongzhen zhen* (uterine cold). She fainted in the bathroom. She insisted I not tell you out of worry. I hadn’t finished explaining when you came in, and that’s what happened.”
Su Nantian said this and knew he hadn’t deceived her. His face was serious.

“What? This Lina, such a big thing didn’t tell her sister. I would find every doctor in the world to help her.”
After saying this, she hurried into the room. There was no trace of anger anymore.
