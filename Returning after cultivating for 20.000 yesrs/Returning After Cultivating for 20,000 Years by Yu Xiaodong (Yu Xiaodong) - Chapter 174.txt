He was utterly astonished by the scene before him, yet he could not help but seek Xu Laofu's guidance: "Mother, this Su Nantian is certainly no ordinary man. He is far too dangerous; even our trained guards stand no chance against him."

Who could control bullets?

At this moment, he thought his nephew Wu Chuan's death was justified—what misfortune had led him to face Su Nantian?

Upon hearing this, Xu Laofu's expression shifted. Though she knew Su Nantian had killed Wu Chuan, she still believed it was mere luck and that he had taken advantage of their carelessness.

But now, witnessing Su Nantian's extraordinary abilities with her own eyes—abilities beyond those of the charlatans they had encountered before—Xu Laofu's heart grew heavier.

"Quickly, Ah Hai," she said, no longer concerned with appearances. "Hurry and bring our people out."

These were the elite individuals Xu Laofu's family had recruited since its inception. Originally, they had been their secret weapon, but now that Su Nantian's strength was undeniable, she could not afford to hesitate. If they did not act swiftly, Su Nantian would surely reach them.

"Yes, Mother!"

Xu Hai had been waiting for this command. Upon hearing Xu Laofu's words, he immediately dialed a number.

These individuals had been nurtured within the Xu estate and rarely used, but when called upon, they were expected to unleash their full power.

When Xu Hai's call came, they felt a surge of surprise. They had remained here for years, only occasionally flexing their power to intimidate others and assert the Xu family's might. Now, they had never faced real enemies.

They felt like rusted weapons, long unused.

Yet now, Xu Hai's urgency and panic puzzled them. Though they were bewildered, their excitement at facing an opponent outweighed their confusion.

They seemed to anticipate a thrilling challenge, no longer bound by the monotony of inaction.

Chapter 869: Extraordinary Individuals in a Strange World

"What kind of person is this? Why the grand display? It's as if something momentous is about to happen!"

One of them, a younger man with an air of arrogance, spoke. His expression was devoid of tension; instead, it brimmed with eagerness, as if he longed to fight.

He was a top-tier martial artist and had once dominated the boxing ring, earning his title through consecutive victories. The Xu family had hired him with great expense. After joining, he no longer competed in matches, but the urge to test his skills still lingered.

The others chuckled at the boxer's words: "No matter who he is, since it's our master's command, we'll just beat him."

This speaker was short and stocky, his eyes sly and cunning. Though he appeared unremarkable, those who knew him understood the power of his Eastern Secret Arts—a forgotten art shrouded in legend. Few had seen it, and even fewer believed in its existence.

Yet now, they could not ignore him.

"Let's go," a man with an imposing presence said. He seemed to lead the group, and his commands naturally commanded obedience.

With his order, each man retrieved their signature weapons and prepared to regroup.

Su Nantian was unaware of the Xu family's hidden ace, but even if he had known, he would not have feared them. At that moment, Su Nantian effortlessly controlled a bullet in the air, sending his guards into panic. Several could not even lift their weapons, trembling with fear.

Others watched Su Nantian with apprehension, wondering what other abilities he possessed.

"Speak," Su Nantian said calmly, the bullet dancing in his control. No one knew his next target.

Each man swallowed nervously, eyes darting anxiously, fearing Su Nantian's sudden attack.

Su Nantian's nonchalant question carried an unspoken threat: one wrong answer, and he would unleash his wrath.

The guards remained silent, their faces frozen in fear. If they refused to answer, they would die; if they revealed the Xu family's location, their fate would be no better.

They were trapped either way, too terrified to speak.

"Refusing to answer?" Su Nantian arched an eyebrow, his tone laced with amusement. "Do you need a lesson before you speak?"

They were truly obtuse, unwilling to cooperate until forced.

"Perhaps I should answer for them," a voice called out as five or six men approached from the distance.

Their attire varied, and they carried strange weapons. Yet when the guards saw them, their eyes widened with relief.

"Captain Qiu! You've arrived!"

The guard captain shouted, his voice laced with joy. It was as if he had seen a savior, placing all his hope in these unexpected arrivals.

"Fall back," Captain Qiu commanded, waving them away. "Leave this to me."

This man was different. Su Nantian's brow furrowed as he sensed a shift in the atmosphere, an odd energy permeating the air.

Upon hearing Qiu's voice, Su Nantian felt a vague certainty—this man was the cause.

"Trouble! Could these be the legendary ones?"

Hongye, stunned, muttered to himself, his face etched with fear.

"What do you mean?" Su Nantian noticed Hongye's shift in expression and asked. He sought a breakthrough, intrigued by these men.

Hongye replied swiftly: "They are the Xu family's secret weapon, rarely seen."

Having witnessed Su Nantian's power, Hongye dared not ignore his question. "But I've heard that once they appear, it's the beginning of the underworld collecting souls."

In other words, these men were formidable—no ordinary foe.

Hearing this, Su Nantian found it amusing. "What underworld collecting souls? If they were truly so powerful, why had he never heard of them?"

"You again," Su Nantian said coldly, ignoring Hongye's words. He turned to the man called Captain Qiu. "Who are you? To answer for them?"

Qiu had never faced such disregard or condescension. Upon hearing Su Nantian's words, his expression darkened.

"Brave talk! Do you know where you've stepped?" Qiu's voice was sharp, his gaze filled with menace.

He intended to crush Su Nantian's arrogance! Let him know this was no place for commoners to barge in.

"Xu family, isn't it?" Su Nantian replied without following the usual script.

Su Nantian's eyes held a smirk, but it was not friendly—it was taunting.

After all, they would fight soon; Su Nantian had no patience for pleasantries.

Chapter 870: Confrontation

"Good, I hope you keep smiling!" Qiu said coldly. His intention was to warn Su Nantian, making him realize he had trespassed upon M City's Xu family.

This was no game!

Thus, Qiu stared at Su Nantian with a cold gaze, wishing to eliminate him immediately.

He despised this man's lack of respect and his arrogance. Moreover, Qiu had never encountered such a person before; after joining the Xu family, no one had dared challenge him.

But this was an opportunity to unleash his wrath after a long time. He would use Su Nantian as a sacrifice and teach him a lesson, making him understand who he was challenging.

"Captain, let me go first!"

The boxing champion, who had won multiple titles, spoke immediately. Upon hearing Su Nantian's dismissive remarks, his gaze now held murder.

Since leaving the ring, he had rarely faced such a fool. Thus, he longed to fight and stretch his limbs.

He wanted Su Nantian to know they were not as easy to underestimate as he thought—first, his confidence, then his resources.

Qiu saw the champion's eagerness and said nothing, merely stepping aside to let him take the lead.

After all, Su Nantian looked no more than a youth; Qiu believed the champion's strength would be enough to humiliate him.

Su Nantian, upon seeing this, said nothing but his expression grew more amused, his gaze deepened.

He too wished to test these men; now there were several to practice against.

Moreover, Su Nantian had understood the situation—he needed to confront the Xu family's people first.

Thus, he was not averse to playing with them.

The boxing champion assumed a stance and said nothing, immediately charging at Su Nantian.

At his peak, one punch or kick could break three ribs. His most notable victory was a single punch that had caused an opponent's heart to fail, leaving him hospitalized.

The champion saw Su Nantian as a young fool who spoke too boldly, classifying him among the reckless. He knew Su Nantian's arrogance stemmed from ignorance—unaware of the world beyond his narrow view.

The champion was determined to teach Su Nantian a lesson and show the others his prowess, so he put all his strength into this punch. If Su Nantian was hit, breaking several ribs would be effortless.

"Fast punches," Su Nantian remarked as the champion unleashed his full strength, sending a sharp wind. His expression shifted slightly, intrigued.

This was more interesting than the previous ordinary men with firearms—boring indeed.

As Su Nantian pondered, the champion had already reached him.

Su Nantian remained calm, adding a thread of spiritual energy to his palm before extending it, wrapping around the champion's fist.

The champion laughed coldly, thinking Su Nantian was naive, believing he could beat him.

But Su Nantian's actions exceeded his expectations.

The champion thought he could break Su Nantian's ribs, but as soon as Su Nantian reached out, he had already stopped his attack.

The champion's fist halted abruptly, and his steps wavered.

"You!" He furrowed his brow, disbelief etched on his face—could this be true?

How could he lose to a nameless youth? A joke!

The champion thought this, gritting his teeth and spitting. He did not give up but instead tried to retract his fist.

Yet Su Nantian's palm held infinite power, preventing him from pulling it back.

"You!" The champion furrowed his brow, struggling to pull his fist free but failing repeatedly.

"Damn it!" After failing to retrieve his hand, the champion cursed under his breath and switched to his other fist.

"Die!" He roared, launching another punch with all his strength.

This time too was futile; Su Nantian simply caught the fist with his hand, leaving no chance to harm him.

"How is this possible?"

Qiu and the others watched from the side, knowing the champion's abilities. They had planned to watch Su Nantian suffer.

Yet they had not anticipated Su Nantian's abilities surpassing their expectations. Their battle was beyond what they had imagined.

This Su Nantian's power was far greater than he appeared!

"How is this possible?" Xu Xiangning exclaimed, watching the scene. She too had expected to see Su Nantian defeated by the champion.

Though she had not cared for Wu Chuan after giving birth to him, she still sought revenge.

But now, with Hongye's arrival and this terrifying youth, it was beyond their expectations.

The one confronting the champion was clearly no ordinary person.

"Mother, you said these were our trump cards! You spent a fortune hiring them—why are they so useless? They can't even beat an ordinary man!"

Xu Xiangning, seeing the champion's two punches blocked by Su Nantian and his inability to break free, was speechless.

Chapter 871: Internal Conflict

How could they not defeat even a common man?

If the Xu family relied on these people, it would surely collapse!

"Mother, did they deceive you?"

Xu Xiangning's frustration led her to speak without restraint. She did not realize that Xu Laofu was already furious, and this accusation would only deepen her anger.

Especially since Xu Laofu, in her high position, had never endured such criticism. Now, Xu Xiangning's boldness was tantamount to death.

Even if Xu Laofu had immense patience for her, it would be exhausted now.

"Silence! What are you talking about?"

Xu Hai was surprised by Xu Xiangning's audacity. Their failure to defeat Su Nantian had already embarrassed them; now, she added fuel to the fire.

This was not just a failure but an admission of being deceived by these so-called masters.

Indeed, Xu Laofu's expression had darkened further after hearing this. Her eyes seemed to burn with fury, but Xu Xiangning remained unaware of the drastic change in her mother's mood.

She focused on stopping Xu Hai: "Silence, Xu Hai! I've tolerated you for too long. Since entering, you've been targeting me—what does that mean?"

She continued loudly: "These people are indeed useless! I'm not mistaken. They can't even beat an ordinary man—what else could they be but gluttons?"

"I'm reminding you, so dare to tell me to stay silent? That's laughable!"

"you!"

Xu Hai had no idea how to argue with his大姐's foolishness. He thought she could twist black into white, turn the dead into the living, making others' mistakes seem her own.

"Did I hit the mark? Can't you respond?"

Xu Xiangning sneered, unaware that Xu Hai was not arguing but avoiding her. Yet she took it as an opportunity to mock him repeatedly, believing herself the cleverest.

"Come on, have the lady escorted into a room. No permission to leave."

Xu Laofu had reached her limit with Xu Xiangning. Originally, she planned to deal with this matter and then send Xu Xiangning to a secluded place for her to perish.

But now, Xu Xiangning's continued provocation had made her mood even worse. Thus, she ordered the attendants to lock Xu Xiangning in a room, preventing her from disturbing her.

"Mother? What did I do wrong? Why are you locking me in a room?"

Xu Xiangning was stunned, never expecting her beloved mother to act this way.

She had always been indulged despite not caring for her, but she still received everything she desired. With the title of Xu family's eldest daughter, she had ruled unchecked.

The attendant intended to follow Xu Laofu's order and escort Xu Xiangning back, but upon hearing her words, he hesitated, fearing it was a temporary outburst.

"Take her away."

Xu Laofu spoke directly, her expression devoid of humor. She was certain and would not let Xu Xiangning escape.

"Mother!"

Xu Xiangning cried out again, unable to accept the order. Why was it her?

She thought: "Mother! You're biased! Because I'm a girl, you favor males!"

Even now, she did not realize her mistake. Worse still, she dared to defy Xu Laofu.

"It must be so! Otherwise why is it me?"

Xu Xiangning's eyes widened, convinced of this guess.

"Silence! How could you say such things!"

Xu Hai glanced at Xu Laofu, then scolded Xu Xiangning harshly.

He had always tolerated her due to Xu Laofu's favor, never uttering a harsh word. But now was different—Xu Xiangning had been rejected by Xu Laofu, and her meddling would not be tolerated.

His harsh rebuke frightened Xu Xiangning.

"Think honestly, from birth to now, have you ever lacked anything? Has Mother ever scolded you? Tell me yourself!"

Xu Hai continued, his gaze filled with impatience: "Don't you ever look for your own faults? You saw Hongye bringing this unknown youth into our Xu family. It's because of you that he dared to come!"

This was not the main reason, but Xu Hai sought an excuse to silence her.

Upon hearing this, Xu Xiangning was frightened and widened her eyes, understanding why Xu Laofu's attitude had changed.

"Mother, it's not like that! Mother!"

She quickly explained, begging for forgiveness: "It's not my fault. I didn't know Hongye would make this decision! Mother, believe me, if I had known, I definitely wouldn't have let him act recklessly!"

Xu Xiangning's desperate explanation was to gain Xu Laofu's forgiveness.

But at this moment, Xu Laofu gave her no second glance.

"Eldest sister, don't you think about what you just said? Mother's heart is broken by your words. Don't speak anymore; let Mother have some peace."

Xu Hai softened his tone, seeing that Xu Laofu had not interrupted him. He knew he was right.

He continued: "You should go down first."

With that, Xu Hai gave Xu Xiangning a reassuring glance.

Xu Xiangning looked at Xu Laofu again, but she still had no intention of giving her a favorable look.

Chapter 872: Retreat

"Mother..."

Xu Xiangning spoke again, but Xu Laofu ignored her completely. She gave no response, as if she hadn't heard her voice at all.

Seeing this, Xu Xiangning bit her lip in frustration, knowing that Xu Laofu was truly angry this time. Thus, she dared not speak further.

"Eldest sister, you don't want to be taken away by us forcefully, do you?"

The attendant observed Xu Laofu's expression and understood her intent. Upon hearing Xu Hai's words, he also grasped the situation.

He hurried to Xu Xiangning and reminded her: "You don't want to lose face in front of these servants, do you?"

Indeed, Xu Xiangning and her kind valued their dignity. If she were taken away in front of the servants, it would be a complete loss of face.

Xu Xiangning heard this and stomped her foot in anger, but ultimately resigned herself to following the attendant.

After she left, the place was indeed quieter. Xu Hai and Xu Tian exchanged a glance but said nothing more. No one dared to plead for Xu Xiangning.

They had grown tired of this foolish eldest sister and longed for Xu Laofu to see her true nature and reject her soon.

Thus, when Xu Laofu began to dislike Xu Xiangning, none of them dared to speak.

"Mother, it's time for us to prepare. If we can't deal with this youth, we should consider retreating."

Xu Hai stepped forward and discussed their escape plan with Xu Laofu.

The Xu family had always acted this way, never fixated on temporary wins. As long as the green hills remained, even if there was no firewood, they could endure.

Xu Hai and his group thought this way, so he reminded Xu Laofu to prepare. They could retreat anytime if problems arose.

"Yes, Mother, it's about the bigger picture."

Xu Tian echoed his brother's words, telling Xu Laofu they would not risk everything. If they couldn't win now, they could seek another opportunity later.

But Xu Laofu shook her head and did not follow their plan. She did not truly prepare to retreat but said, "Let's watch for now. We've hired so many extraordinary individuals; this is the time to use them. If they can't even handle this, how could they be our secret weapon?"

Xu Laofu was not confident in these people but wanted to gamble. She wished to personally see this youth's identity and abilities, which made him so bold as to challenge the Xu family.

Moreover, after observing this video, she noticed a clue—she saw Hongye's relationship with the youth was not close at all. In fact, it seemed Hongye submitted to this youth.

Though Hongye was not a top hero, Xu Laofu understood his pride and cunning nature. If someone made him wary, it must be significant.

Thus, she was even more curious about this youth. She had no idea he was the opponent they had long sought—the one who killed Wu Chuan.

If they knew, Xu Laofu would be even more unsettled and wouldn't stay to watch.

Xu Hai and his group had always obeyed Xu Laofu's orders, so upon hearing her decision, they exchanged a glance but said nothing to interrupt.

In any case, they prepared for two scenarios: one was gathering supplies for retreat, and the other was staying here with Xu Laofu to watch. If anything went wrong, they could retreat anytime.

After all, when the Xu family built this mansion, they had prepared countless secret passages and escape routes.

Those who had just entered the Xu family, like Su Nantian, didn't even know how many bedrooms there were. How could they know their escape routes?

Thus, Xu Hai and his group weren't overly worried.

At this moment, those opposing Su Nantian had all been defeated, leaving only Captain Qiu and the short man who was familiar with Eastern Secret Arts—Ye Tengyilang.

Seeing their usual companions defeated by Su Nantian, they were stunned at his strength. Their expressions were heavy, none truly relaxed.

"Captain Qiu! Let me go first!"

The short man stepped forward and said this to Captain Qiu. His eyes were sly, like a snake that had just crawled out of its hole—his gaze was unsettling.

After saying this, he wanted to charge at Su Nantian immediately.

But Captain Qiu only reached out and grabbed the man, saying: "They have all failed one by one. Now it's just us two; we must work together."

This was a statement Captain Qiu had never made before. He had always been proud of his abilities and preferred to fight alone. But after witnessing Su Nantian's strength, he had chosen to retreat and confront him this way.

"First priority is to deal with this man," Captain Qiu said, knowing that such masters preferred to fight alone. No one liked others interfering in their battles.

Thus, he reminded the man again to prioritize the bigger picture.

"Good!"

The short man hesitated but realized Su Nantian was an opponent he had never faced before. He had seen Su Nantian effortlessly defeat his companions and now appeared unexhausted, so he changed his mind.

He agreed with Captain Qiu's decision: "Then let's fight together and deal with this brat!"

They could complement each other—one attacking openly, the other secretly. Whatever method worked to defeat Su Nantian was acceptable.

"Then fight together," Su Nantian said upon hearing their conversation, but he only smiled and ignored their words.

One coming was no problem; two was no different. Even if they had charged as a team, Su Nantian could handle them.

"Brave talk!"

Captain Qiu and the short man heard Su Nantian's words and saw his indifferent expression. Their tones were light, but their faces were grim.

They both felt insulted and wanted to kill Su Nantian immediately.

After exchanging a glance, they prepared to confront Su Nantian. The short man suddenly vanished into thin air, as if he had never existed.

"Ah!"

Su Nantian remained calm and composed, his expression unchanged as if nothing unusual had happened.

But Hongye by his side was stunned and widened his eyes, unable to accept this reality. He had no idea how the man had disappeared before his very eyes.

"Vanished? This, this... it's impossible!"

Hongye inhaled sharply and wrapped his arms around himself, as if this could give him strength to face the fear.

His eyes darted everywhere, trying to catch the short man's movements. But this was futile; Hongye would never find him.

Thus, he shivered and his arms were covered in goosebumps.

"Silence," Su Nantian frowned, thinking he should have left Hongye at the entrance. He was a local boss but couldn't handle such a small scene, always overreacting and annoying.

Su Nantian warned Hongye to stay silent and keep quiet.

But Su Nantian had forgotten that if it were only this one thing, Hongye would not have been so panicked. However, in a single night, so many major events had occurred.

Moreover, Hongye had just been defeated by Su Nantian; he was now terrified and had witnessed other strange occurrences beyond human ability. Thus, he could not remain calm.

But after Su Nantian's warning, Hongye clamped his teeth and tried to stay silent. Though his body still trembled uncontrollably, he dared not make a sound.

After all, compared to the short man's disappearance, Su Nantian was far more terrifying.

Between the two, Hongye felt slightly calmer.

"Let's see how long you can keep this composure!"

Captain Qiu had been watching Su Nantian's expression. Seeing he was not as frightened or uneasy as expected, he felt dissatisfied.

He had been shocked when first encountering the short man using Eastern Secret Arts, but Su Nantian remained so calm. It was as if nothing could escape his sight.

This comparison made him feel he had lost to Su Nantian, so naturally, he was dissatisfied.

After saying this, Captain Qiu did not waste time but rushed forward to teach Su Nantian a lesson.

But he quickly understood why Su Nantian could remain so calm.

Before he even attacked, Su Nantian had already kicked a blank spot, causing the short man to let out a scream and reveal his form.

"Ah!"

The short man was kicked heavily, rolling on the ground and groaning in pain.

He had intended to ambush Su Nantian but was caught off guard. Before he could even retrieve his hidden weapon, Su Nantian had already kicked him into view.

"You can see!"

Captain Qiu was stunned, unable to believe that even they did not know how the short man moved. Yet Su Nantian had precisely located him and attacked immediately.

To attack was one thing, but to find him so easily—this was another.

"Thus why you're so calm!"

Captain Qiu spoke again, his expression stunned. He had no choice but to feel a bit of fear toward Su Nantian, though he quickly regained his composure.

After all, they hadn't even started fighting yet—how could he lose his courage so soon?

Chapter 873: United Efforts

"Let's see how long you can keep this composure!"

Captain Qiu had been watching Su Nantian's expression. Seeing he was not as frightened or uneasy as expected, he felt dissatisfied.

He had been shocked when first encountering the short man using Eastern Secret Arts, but Su Nantian remained so calm. It was as if nothing could escape his sight.

This comparison made him feel he had lost to Su Nantian, so naturally, he was dissatisfied.

After saying this, Captain Qiu did not waste time but rushed forward to teach Su Nantian a lesson.

But he quickly understood why Su Nantian could remain so calm.

Before he even attacked, Su Nantian had already kicked a blank spot, causing the short man to let out a scream and reveal his form.

"Ah!"

The short man was kicked heavily, rolling on the ground and groaning in pain.

He had intended to ambush Su Nantian but was caught off guard. Before he could even retrieve his hidden weapon, Su Nantian had already kicked him into view.

"You can see!"

Captain Qiu was stunned, unable to believe that even they did not know how the short man moved. Yet Su Nantian had precisely located him and attacked immediately.

To attack was one thing, but to find him so easily—this was another.

"Thus why you're so calm!"

Captain Qiu spoke again, his expression stunned. He had no choice but to feel a bit of fear toward Su Nantian, though he quickly regained his composure.

After all, they hadn't even started fighting yet—how could he lose his courage so soon?
