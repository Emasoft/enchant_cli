“Be quiet!” Wang Dashan gave a meaningful glance, and the group moved to a corner. They watched Su Nantian calmly eating breakfast, unaware of their conversation.

“Those cars aren’t here for us. I think they’re after Su Nantian. But why would the Sea King Gang target him today? They didn’t do anything to him yesterday. This doesn’t fit their style at all. I think they’re after something else.”

At that moment, the cars pulled up outside their door. Wang Dashan and his companions suddenly stared in shock at one of the vehicles.

“Is that…?” Sun Qi pointed at the car, his jaw dropping in disbelief.

“What is it? Tell me!” Wang Dashan, less perceptive than Sun Qi, didn’t understand what had caught his attention.

“Don’t you recognize this car? It’s the Sea King Gang leader’s private vehicle. Only he and his military strategist He Zun are allowed to ride in it.” Sun Qi explained hurriedly. Though they hadn’t lived well in Ruo Hai District, Sun Qi’s habit of gathering information had made him thoroughly familiar with the Sea King Gang’s basics.

Five hundred and thirty-three: Breakfast

At that moment, people exited the car—all Sea King Gang members. Even the so-called private vehicle had someone stepping out.

“Look! It’s He Zun!” Sun Qi exclaimed excitedly.

Yet Su Nantian remained calm, eating breakfast without concern for the outside world.

He Zun entered the room surrounded by Sea King Gang members, then said to Su Nantian: “Get in the car. We’re leaving.”

Even if Wang Dashan and his companions had been confused before, they now understood Su Nantian hadn’t been punished by the Sea King Gang. Instead, he seemed to have some hidden connection with them.

But Su Nantian’s reply shocked everyone. His words seemed reckless, even suicidal.

He waved his breakfast bowl and pointed to the remaining porridge: “I can’t leave yet. I haven’t finished breakfast.”

He Zun’s expression turned skeptical.

“You said what? Breakfast? I told you to leave immediately. What are you doing eating breakfast? There’s no time for this!”

As He Zun spoke, his subordinates grew increasingly agitated. Though they’d heard of Su Nantian’s strength yesterday, none had experienced it firsthand. They still believed they could easily defeat him if given the chance.

But before He Zun could urge again, a loud laugh echoed behind them.

“Hahahaha! Breakfast? That’s an unusual excuse. How long has it been since I last had breakfast? Alright, stop pushing him. Let’s sit and have breakfast together. We can leave after we’re done.”

Wang Dashan and his group turned in disbelief, only to find it was Yuan Da Ying—the Sea King Gang’s current leader.

“Is there more breakfast? Prepare two more portions.” He Zun turned to the group in the corner.

Wang Dashan and his companions had never been so close to He Zun or Yuan Da Ying. They hadn’t even dared speak to them before.

“Yes, yes! We’ll prepare it right away. Just wait a moment.” Wang Dashan nodded and rushed to the kitchen with others. The food wasn’t homemade but bought from nearby.

Though few people were open for business, there were still the elderly, women, and children. Yuan Da Ying had ordered that no one could eat without paying. Thus, Wang Dashan’s group still found ways to survive.

They quickly brought two more breakfasts. He Zun and Yuan Da Ying sat at the same table as Su Nantian, three of them eating together like old friends.

After placing the meals on the table, Wang Dashan and his group returned to their corner. For them, being invisible was ideal—they didn’t want to be noticed or valued.

But they couldn’t fathom Yuan Da Ying and He Zun eating breakfast with Su Nantian. They’d thought Yuan Da Ying was mocking Su Nantian.

After about ten minutes, the group finally finished. Su Nantian set down his chopsticks and patted his stomach, saying to Yuan Da Ying and He Zun: “Alright, breakfast is done. We can leave now.”

Wang Dashan and his group couldn’t believe Su Nantian spoke to Yuan Da Ying like that, as if Yuan Da Ying were begging him. Everyone waited for departure, but Su Nantian remained calm.

Even more astonishing was Yuan Da Ying’s cheerful demeanor. He nodded: “Fine, since you’re done, let’s go. Move out.”

Su Nantian and Yuan Da Ying walked ahead, followed by the Sea King Gang’s subordinates. It seemed Su Nantian had infiltrated the gang and held a high position.

As the cars’ engines roared, dust kicked up as they left South Palace House. Only then did Wang Dashan and his group relax.

“What… what’s going on?” Wang Dashan sat on a chair, utterly confused about the situation.

“Who is Su Nantian? He only met the Sea King Gang last night. We thought he was in trouble, but today he’s already on a first-name basis with them.” Liu Miao found it all too incredible. He couldn’t fathom how Su Nantian had returned this way.

“Plus, these are Yuan Da Ying and He Zun—the top two of the Sea King Gang. People fear their names. Today, they’re eating breakfast with Su Nantian. Am I hallucinating?” Sun Qi rubbed his eyes, confirming the three bowls on the table before accepting it was real.

Even Liu Zhiping, usually quiet, looked shaken. They couldn’t believe what they’d seen.

At the same time, their minds buzzed with one question: What was Su Nantian? What charm did he have to make the Sea King Gang leader treat him this way?

Meanwhile, Wang Dashan also pondered what conflict existed between Zeng Chao and Su Nantian. Perhaps they’d underestimated Su Nantian from the start. Zeng Chao, who controlled nearly all of South Palace House’s security forces, wouldn’t waste time on someone like this. That meant Su Nantian’s identity and status were extraordinary—something beyond their reach. Wang Dashan also felt his own foolishness, realizing he shouldn’t have opposed Su Nantian from the beginning.

Five hundred and thirty-four: Death Soldiers

Su Nantian climbed into the same car as Yuan Da Ying and He Zun. When he entered, Sea King Gang members around him gaped in surprise. In their minds, only Yuan Da Ying and He Zun could sit in this vehicle.

Yet Su Nantian—someone who’d been scolded by them yesterday—now sat with the two leaders. This shocked them.

At the same time, Sea King Gang members realized Su Nantian’s current status surpassed theirs. He Zun and Yuan Da Ying clearly valued him.

After the car started moving, Su Nantian finally spoke: “Now can you tell me what we’re doing? I’m just a laborer, but I deserve the right to know.”

Earlier, He Zun hadn’t answered immediately. Instead, he glanced at Yuan Da Ying, who nodded in agreement.

After all, the car had already left. Su Nantian was now a sitting duck with no escape. Telling him now posed no risk.

If they’d told Su Nantian earlier, he might have found a way to leave. But now, there was no need for hesitation—unless Su Nantian could vanish before them.

“Actually, it’s simple. We have a business dispute with the other side. Neither party has decided who will take over yet. So we agreed to settle it today. Each side sends a death soldier. The one whose person survives gets the business. So do you understand your task?”

He Zun’s words were concise and clear, explaining the situation in three sentences.

Su Nantian now understood: Yuan Da Ying had used him as a pawn. If he died, the Sea King Gang would suffer no loss—no brother sacrificed.

After all, to win reliably, they needed a skilled fighter. Losing one of their own would hurt Yuan Da Ying deeply.

But now Su Nantian had arrived, and after yesterday’s events, Yuan Da Ying and He Zun realized Su Nantian was skilled.

So today, he either won for them or, even if lost, they wouldn’t care. After all, Su Nantian wasn’t one of them.

Su Nantian smiled and glanced at He Zun, then Yuan Da Ying.

“You guys really came to use me as a pawn. If I win, you’ll get the business. But if I die… I’m not one of your Sea King Gang members, so you won’t care. Did you feel happy yesterday when I walked into the trap? You must have been nervous whether to send your own men.”

Su Nantian didn’t hide his thoughts, stating their minds outright.

Yuan Da Ying chuckled and pointed at Su Nantian: “You’re a clever kid. That’s the truth. To put it bluntly, you’re a pawn. But if you win, I’ll keep my promise. This opportunity was yours to seize. Now that you’re in the car, there’s no turning back.”

Yuan Da Ying’s face turned serious at the end. His eyes flashed with a sharp intensity, as if trying to suppress Su Nantian.

But Yuan Da Ying found this tactic ineffective against Su Nantian.

Yuan Da Ying, the Sea King Gang leader for years, had his own methods of intimidating others. Usually, just a glare or a scowl would send subordinates fleeing in fear.

His aura was naturally formed since taking control of the Sea King Gang. It wasn’t an illusion but a real presence.

Yet Yuan Da Ying found his usual methods had no effect on Su Nantian. This made him more curious about Su Nantian’s background. But no matter how they probed, including what Su Nantian himself said, he was merely a bodyguard of the South Palace House.

In fact, Yuan Da Ying had already ordered He Zun to investigate Su Nantian’s identity. But the result was only that he was a bodyguard of South Palace House’s young master.

Because he’d recently clashed with Zeng Chao, the head of South Palace House’s security forces, he was assigned here. It seemed just a reckless young man who had offended his superior.

But Yuan Da Ying increasingly felt this person was extraordinary.

Even for a moment, he wondered if Su Nantian had come to destroy the Sea King Gang. After all, they’d oppressed several families for a long time. They took money monthly from these families. Perhaps this was the families’ joint resistance.

But later, Yuan Da Ying laughed at his own thought. If they truly wanted to destroy the Sea King Gang, they wouldn’t send just one person. It was his own paranoia.

Also, Yuan Da Ying had to admit he was getting old. If he were younger, he would have dismissed these suspicions. He’d face any conspiracy or attack head-on. But now, he had to be cautious.

“Don’t worry. If you handle this task well, I’ll keep my promise. This business is important to me, so I must get it.”

Yuan Da Ying continued staring at Su Nantian.

“You can rest assured. Now that I’m in this car, there’s no turning back. As the saying goes, an arrow shot can’t return. I’ve come with you today, and I’ll definitely finish this task for you. It’s just a matter of risking my life. You can rest easy, I’ll cherish this life and won’t let them succeed.”

Su Nantian patted his chest, reassuring Yuan Da Ying. But Su Nantian hadn’t expected Yuan Da Ying to assign him such a task. He’d thought he was just going to be a hired hand.

Five hundred and thirty-five: Opponent

After some time, they finally arrived at their destination. It was the same bar Su Nantian had seen in Song Lichen’s files—his targeted location.

But Yuan Da Ying and He Zun didn’t enter their own bar. Instead, the car continued forward to another one.

This bar was identical to the one in Su Nantian’s files. It seemed, as he’d suspected, that Yuan Da Ying’s bar had clashed with this one.

After the car stopped, Su Nantian said nothing and followed He Zun and Yuan Da Ying out. They entered the bar with a group of twenty.

Perhaps because it was daytime, the bar wasn’t open yet. When they entered, the empty space filled slightly.

He Zun waved to a subordinate, who walked forward and shouted: “Lao Lai? The Sea King Gang is here!”

Su Nantian then realized this subordinate was the one to provoke. Since no one else was present in the bar, he didn’t know where the people were.

After a while, someone emerged and waved to them: “Lao Lai is downstairs. Follow me down.”

He Zun nodded, and the group followed him downward. Su Nantian then discovered this bar had a hidden underground area beyond the first floor.

It seemed this underground space wasn’t usually open. The door was very隐蔽, and without a guide, it would be hard to find. Also, the passage was narrow, only allowing two people to walk side by side.

Su Nantian immediately understood this underground area was for illicit activities.

But since it was a conflict between the Sea King Gang and this so-called Lao Lai, it must be over high-profit but illegal activities.

When Yang Yu and the group walked down the winding passage, Yang Yu realized this underground area was larger than the bar above.

He also noticed an boxing ring in the center of the space. It seemed this place hosted private boxing matches, and the empty seats indicated it was often frequented by spectators.

Seeing this, Yang Yu understood Yuan Da Ying’s group must also have such an underground boxing arena.

This bar had one too, and since both were so close, they competed for the same customers. If both opened simultaneously, it would affect their income.

At this moment, a man walked over and smiled, extending his hand to Yuan Da Ying: “Big Brother Yuan, you’ve come. I’ve been waiting for a long time.”

This was just a greeting, but the man’s expression changed and he said: “I’ve waited too long. I thought you wouldn’t come.”

This statement was clearly provocative.

Yuan Da Ying, though provoked, remained calm. He shook the man’s hand and said: “I was afraid I came too early and scared you. Let me give you some time to survive. If we had come earlier, you would have met your end sooner. Hahahaha.”

Yuan Da Ying’s laughter was loud, and the man in front of him looked uncomfortable. His face turned dark.

“Then let’s settle this and get started. Since we’re competing for the underground boxing business, as agreed before, each side sends one death soldier. The winner keeps the business; the loser must pack up and leave, even giving up this bar.”

The man named Lao Lai said this after being mocked by Yuan Da Ying. He was eager to start the match and prove his side’s strength.

Yuan Da Ying glanced at Su Nantian, then continued: “Of course, we’ve already agreed. Have you found your person yet?”

Lao Lai smiled, looking very confident.

He waved to the people behind him and said: “Bring out my secret weapon.”

After a while, a foreigner with golden hair and blue eyes walked over. His physique was extremely large, even taller than Su Nantian.

Su Nantian was 185 cm tall and already seemed very tall. But this foreigner looked at least 190 cm.

This man was clearly built with massive muscles. Compared to Su Nantian, who appeared slim in clothes but had a well-proportioned body, Su Nantian looked slender and not someone who trained in muscles.

Lao Lai always acted as if he had already won. He said to Yuan Da Ying: “How about it? Who are you sending?”

At this moment, He Zun looked at the foreigner Lao Lai had sent and gasped. He whispered to Yuan Da Ying: “Big Brother, did we act too hastily? This kid looked good yesterday, but Lao Lai’s choice is really strong.”

He Zun’s words clearly indicated he knew who this foreigner was. Yuan Da Ying, hearing this, asked curiously: “What? You know who this foreigner is?”

He Zun nodded immediately, looking very secretive.

Su Nantian was also extremely curious and listened carefully to what Yuan Da Ying and He Zun were saying. Yang Yu was also curious about this foreigner, especially since He Zun seemed very wary.

He Zun’s words clearly showed doubt in Su Nantian’s strength. Even though they had seen Su Nantian fight many people yesterday, He Zun still felt this match might be hard for Su Nantian to win.

This stirred a competitive spirit in Su Nantian. He wanted to see how strong this foreigner was, enough to make He Zun so fearful.

Five hundred and thirty-six: Tom

Yuan Da Ying’s group was clearly very interested in He Zun’s foreigner, but seeing He Zun’s hesitation made him angry. He said: “Speak up! What’s the deal with this foreigner? Just tell me.”

He Zun nodded and said: “His name is Tom. He’s a boxer in the underground fighting scene. He’s been touring abroad and has never lost a match. Anyone who fought him either got seriously injured or died. This man is terrifying. I think Lao Lai spent a lot of money to get him.”

Su Nantian heard He Zun’s words and clearly understood why He Zun was wary. If this Tom really was as strong as He Zun said, it wasn’t just He Zun who would be wary. Su Nantian might also need to be more cautious and careful.

After hearing He Zun’s words, even Yuan Da Ying frowned. He hadn’t expected Lao Lai to invest so much for this match, probably spending a lot of money to get Tom.

“So Big Brother, should we cancel this now? I think this kid can’t beat him. If we lose the bar, it’ll be a big loss. Let’s lower our pride and reschedule for later. We can find some help in the meantime.”

Clearly, He Zun had already decided Su Nantian couldn’t win. Even if he asked Yuan Da Ying to lower their pride and ask Lao Lai for a delay, it was better than sending Su Nantian.

After all, for He Zun, if Su Nantian died, it was no big deal. But for the Sea King Gang, losing this bar would be a major loss.

After all, they were now relying on extorting money from several families in Ruo Hai District. It wasn’t enough to sustain their current lifestyle. The Sea King Gang was growing larger, and they needed more industries under their control to generate profit. This bar was crucial for them.

Su Nantian understood He Zun’s meaning, but hearing him belittle his strength made him angry. It felt like He Zun was looking down on him.

After hearing this, Yuan Da Ying nodded but said: “Even if we lower our pride and ask Lao Lai for a delay, can you guarantee that in these few days we’ll find someone stronger than this Tom? If we don’t, the result will be the same. And we’ll have to beg him for a delay, which would be a loss.”

Yuan Da Ying’s temperament was much tougher than He Zun. When he heard He Zun suggest they beg Lao Lai for a delay, it made him uncomfortable.

Yuan Da Ying also disliked these foreigners, especially this Tom who looked down on them. It made him extremely angry.

After hearing Yuan Da Ying’s words, He Zun thought for a moment. He realized if they truly wanted to find someone who could match Tom, it would be very difficult.

At least in He Zun’s mind, no one could guarantee a win against Tom.

At this moment, Lao Lai seemed to sense something. Since Yuan Da Ying and He Zun had been whispering, and since Tom appeared, they had been discussing something. They must have recognized Tom’s identity and were planning a strategy.

So Lao Lai smiled and said: “What are you two talking about? You can just surrender. At least it’ll save a life. Just hand over your bar to me, and you’ll know who Tom is. Do I need to introduce him again?”

After saying this, Lao Lai turned to his subordinates and laughed: “Look at their faces. It’s really funny. The Sea King Gang, Yuan Da Ying—how they talk big! Now they’re just a bunch of cowards!”

At this, Lao Lai’s subordinates laughed loudly. This man was now openly stepping on Yuan Da Ying.

Yuan Da Ying had a very tough backbone. He couldn’t stand being mocked, so he said to He Zun: “Damn it! They’ve stepped on my head. I still have to beg them for a delay? Even if I had to grovel, you couldn’t find someone stronger than this so-called Tom. If that’s the case, let this kid go ahead. After all, I saw his strength yesterday and it was quite good. Maybe he could have an unexpected result.”

After saying this, Yuan Da Ying turned to Su Nantian and said: “Kid, your opponent is really strong. Did you hear what he just said? What do you think?”

Su Nantian hadn’t expected Yuan Da Ying to ask his opinion. He was stunned and said: “This foreigner hasn’t lost yet because he hasn’t met someone stronger. If he only faces weaklings, there’s nothing to brag about.”

“Hahahaha! If you go up, how confident are you of beating him?” Yuan Da Ying continued.

“Tenfold confidence. I came here to win. Only if I win can you agree to my request. There’s no other choice for me, so I definitely won’t lose.”

After Su Nantian said this, He Zun pointed at him and said: “You kid, don’t be too overconfident. You think because you beat a few people yesterday that you’re invincible? If you die, it doesn’t matter to us. But if you lose and we have to give up the bar, that’s our biggest loss. I can’t let you risk the Sea King Gang.”

Five hundred and thirty-seven: Provocation

Clearly, He Zun and Yuan Da Ying now had differing opinions.

He Zun’s perspective was from the Sea King Gang. He believed Su Nantian couldn’t beat Tom. If he lost, Su Nantian’s life didn’t matter. But if they lost the bar, it would be a major loss for the Sea King Gang.

Yuan Da Ying’s perspective was that they had already been mocked by Lao Lai. Even if they begged for a delay, it was unlikely they’d find someone stronger than Tom. So it was better to let Su Nantian try. He had seen Su Nantian’s strength before and felt it was beyond his expectations.

Su Nantian himself believed he wouldn’t lose. But hearing He Zun’s description, Tom’s strength was also remarkable. He just needed to be careful.

“Big Brother, for the Sea King Gang’s sake, you should think carefully. This isn’t a time for impulsive decisions. Our bar is very important.” He Zun knew Yuan Da Ying didn’t respond to harshness. If he argued directly, Yuan Da Ying might decide on Su Nantian’s behalf out of anger. But if he spoke gently, Yuan Da Ying would think it over.

But now Yuan Da Ying was angry at Lao Lai, so he waved his hand and said: “Don’t say anything. Just let this kid go up. I’ll take responsibility for the consequences. The Sea King Gang rose from nothing, and even if we lose this bar, it won’t shake our foundation. We can start over. I just can’t ask Lao Lai for a delay today!”

After saying this, Yuan Da Ying walked to Su Nantian’s side and patted his shoulder: “Kid, if you win today, I’ll not only keep my promise but also make you a brother of the Sea King Gang. From now on, whenever we see you, it’ll be like seeing our own brother.”

Su Nantian smiled and said: “You can rest assured. I’ll handle this.”

In fact, Su Nantian had already thought about his attitude toward the Sea King Gang. Clearly, his immediate goal was to have them stop harassing South Palace House so he could return earlier and rescue Wu You’er and Wu Tao’s couple.

But Su Nantian also understood that in the capital, a place like Ruo Hai District existed this way. It showed the Sea King Gang’s potential power in the capital.

Everyone thought the Sea King Gang was despicable and avoided them. But Su Nantian saw that if he could use the Sea King Gang’s power, his private strength would grow stronger.

So if Yuan Da Ying truly said he could build a relationship with the Sea King Gang through this, it would be a powerful support for Su Nantian’s future development.

“Big Brother, just listen to me. Why are you so stubborn and insist on sending this kid? Also, why should we respect him? Don’t let your promise to him be meaningless.”

He Zun still insisted on his view. He didn’t believe Su Nantian could win this match. And he looked at Su Nantian, not knowing what promise Yuan Da Ying had given him.

But now Yuan Da Ying’s attitude was very firm. He told He Zun: “Enough, I’ve decided. If you keep talking, I’ll have to ask someone to escort you out.”

Hearing Yuan Da Ying’s words, He Zun could only reluctantly shut up. Though he was very unwilling, he knew Yuan Da Ying’s words weren’t empty threats. If he continued talking, Yuan Da Ying would really have him escorted out.

At this moment, Lao Lai said: “How about it? Have you decided yet? Are you going to surrender now?”

After saying this, Lao Lai and his subordinates laughed again. Tom, the foreigner among them, also smiled, mocking them.

Yuan Da Ying stepped forward and sneered: “Lao Lai, stop talking nonsense. We were just discussing how to celebrate after we win.”

Lao Lai heard this and sneered: “Then show me who your expert is.”

Yuan Da Ying heard this and patted Su Nantian’s shoulder: “We don’t need outsiders. Let this kid go up.”

“Yuan Da Ying, are you sure? Let such a weak kid go up? He doesn’t even have two pounds of muscle. Can he beat Tom? Do I need to explain Tom’s past victories again?”

When Lao Lai saw Su Nantian standing next to Yuan Da Ying, he laughed again. Even Tom looked at Su Nantian with disdain.

But Su Nantian stepped forward and said to Lao Lai: “You haven’t even fought yet, how do you know I can’t win? Besides, it’s about fists, not height or weight. Your big brother might not beat me.”

Hearing Su Nantian’s arrogant words, Lao Lai was stunned and then laughed again.

“Hahahaha! Did you hear what this kid said? He claims he can beat Tom. That’s the funniest joke I’ve heard today.”

After saying this, Lao Lai patted Tom’s shoulder and said to him: “Tom, see? This kid is your opponent. Play with him and humiliate him. Don’t give him any mercy!”

But Tom, after hearing Lao Lai’s words, nodded and clenched his fists, looking very arrogant.

Tom raised his fist, waved it at Su Nantian, and said in broken Chinese: “You’re going to die here today!”

After saying this, Tom took off his jacket and walked toward the boxing ring.

When Tom stood on the ring, he waved at Su Nantian and said: “Come here! Let’s start!”

But before Su Nantian could step onto the ring, Lao Lai extended his hand: “Don’t rush. Sign the death contract first. Tom has already signed it. After you sign, then get on the ring. If anything happens, it’s part of the match—no blame.”

Five hundred and thirty-eight: Ring

Su Nantian heard Lao Lai calling him over to sign the death contract and walked over directly.

On the table in front of Lao Lai was a paper. Su Nantian glanced at it and recognized it as a death contract. It stated that whatever happened during the match was voluntary, and any injury or death would be considered normal. No one could blame others afterward.
