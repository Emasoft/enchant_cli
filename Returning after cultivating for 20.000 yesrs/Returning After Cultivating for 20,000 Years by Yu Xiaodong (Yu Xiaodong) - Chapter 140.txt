“Has there been any improvement?”

Hearing this, Su Nantian also wore a smile. His previously tense mood relaxed at this moment, and his expression softened slightly.

After so many days, he had finally received a piece of somewhat encouraging news.

“By the way, are you sure you didn’t mishear?”

Although Su Nantian had heard a rare piece of good news, he dared not relax. He immediately questioned Lü Li again to confirm the new information.

“It’s true! I saw them deliver food myself!”

Lü Li nodded vigorously, then made a promise gesture. She added cheerfully: “It’s great! Miss Wu You’er can finally eat now. She was too thin, like a breeze could knock her over.”

After saying this, Lü Li muttered to herself: “It’s great!”

“Hmm.”

Su Nantian finally believed Lü Li’s news and was infected by her joy, his face also showing a smile.

“Thank you.”

Su Nantian began to express gratitude toward Lü Li, then said: “Keep an eye on Wu You’er’s situation. If you find anything new, please inform me immediately, okay?”

“Yes! I know!”

Lü Li nodded seriously at Su Nantian and loudly promised: “Mr. Su, rest assured! I will definitely keep a close watch. I also hope Miss Wu You’er can be happy.”

“Thank you.”

Su Nantian thanked again, then gave Lü Li some more instructions before sending her off.

After Lü Li left, Su Nantian’s joy vanished immediately, as if it had never existed.

Because Su Nantian knew that compared to the good news he had just heard, his task was not yet complete. This mission was only one-third done, barely half.

He could not be lulled into complacency by this small discovery, nor should he become overly pleased. His task was to accelerate his efforts and find Wu You’er and her parents’ location as soon as possible, then bring them out swiftly.

Thinking of this, Su Nantian clenched his fists in frustration.

He had undertaken countless missions, yet why was this one so troublesome and stubborn?

Because the progress was too slow, Su Nantian felt his mood was terrible. Especially since his sixth sense told him that delaying further would bring no good results.

At this moment, Su Nantian was still preoccupied with finding Wu You’er’s whereabouts and had no idea that his prediction from today would soon come true.

And the timing of its truth was utterly unexpected.

“Nantian! You’re back?”

Su Nantian had been deep in thought throughout his journey. Upon returning to the Nan Gong family estate, he saw Nan Gong Ping approaching him.

Nan Gong Ping seemed to have been searching for Su Nantian. Upon seeing him, his eyes lit up immediately. Then Nan Gong Ping continued: “Where did you go? I searched everywhere but couldn’t find you.”

“I just took a walk.”

Seeing Nan Gong Ping, Su Nantian immediately suppressed his current expression and temporarily set aside the thoughts he had been pondering. He carefully responded, avoiding revealing any more clues to Nan Gong Ping.

“Oh? Did you go see Miss Wu You’er?”

Nan Gong Ping didn’t seem to mind. A moment later, he suddenly teased Su Nantian and looked at him with a teasing and flirtatious gaze.

“Master Nan, you’re back again.”

Su Nantian saw that Nan Gong Ping was still fixated on this issue, and he was thoroughly annoyed.

“Alright, I know! You’re too sensitive, don’t tease me anymore, okay?”

Nan Gong Ping interrupted Su Nantian’s words, acting as if he were willing to compromise. However, the amusement in his expression was clearly evident. It seemed he had no intention of taking Su Nantian’s words seriously.

Chapter 701: Reporting Progress

“Master Nan, what did you need?”

Su Nantian knew he couldn’t correct Nan Gong Ping’s thoughts, so he didn’t dwell on it further. Instead, he shifted the topic to other matters, diverting Nan Gong Ping’s attention.

“Oh! Right, I almost forgot the main issue.”

After hearing Su Nantian’s reminder, Nan Gong Ping patted his head and continued: “I was about to go report the contract matters to Father. Come with me too.”

Nan Gong Ping added: “If I miss anything, please help me fill it in.”

Nan Gong Ping was still somewhat intimidated by his esteemed father, even though the task had been completed. He had already rehearsed what he needed to say but still felt anxious.

Thus, Nan Gong Ping placed his hopes on Su Nantian, who was usually calm and composed.

“Master Nan, you’re joking. Where do I need to supplement?”

Su Nantian clearly understood why Nan Gong Ping said this. It was simply because he felt insecure facing Nan Gong Lin and sought Su Nantian’s support for reassurance.

But while he knew this, voicing it was another matter.

Even someone as ordinary as Nan Gong Ping had self-respect. He could admit his own shortcomings, but if Su Nantian actually agreed, it would certainly anger Nan Gong Ping.

Therefore, Su Nantian didn’t foolishly accept the conversation but instead subtly praised Nan Gong Ping and expressed gratitude with a sense of pride: “It’s because the Master didn’t discard me that I have this opportunity today.”

“Ha! You…”

Nan Gong Ping, upon hearing this, felt immensely satisfied. He laughed heartily and looked at Su Nantian with admiration, especially a sense of approval for Su Nantian’s tact.

After exchanging a few words, this small incident passed. Su Nantian followed Nan Gong Ping and reported the progress to Nan Gong Lin.

“Father, Wu Chuan has signed the contract. It seems he is temporarily on our side. The cooperation should have no issues.”

When addressing Nan Gong Lin, Nan Gong Ping instantly became serious. He seemed to respect Nan Gong Lin greatly, so much so that it appeared almost reverent.

“Hmm.”

Nan Gong Lin nodded in satisfaction, his eyes reflecting a faint approval: “Good. I know you could complete this task.”

“Father’s guidance has been outstanding.”

Upon hearing this, Nan Gong Ping immediately lowered his head and answered respectfully.

“Hmm. However, Wu Chuan is a sly old fox. One misstep and he’ll exploit the gap. Although you’ve temporarily reached an agreement with him, never let your guard down.”

Nan Gong Lin first praised Nan Gong Ping before giving instructions.

“Remember, never become overconfident. There are still more matters to discuss. Don’t be deceived by his surface, thinking he’s easygoing.”

Nan Gong Lin paused, as if recalling Wu Chuan’s slyness and treachery. He let out a cold laugh before continuing: “Beneath that face, he hides many faces. Ping, remember this well.”

“Yes, Father! I’ve remembered it all.”

Upon hearing Nan Gong Lin’s instructions, Nan Gong Ping immediately obediently lowered his head. He crouched low, placing Nan Gong Lin at the highest position.

Their current interaction was not that of father and son but rather a loyal subject and sovereign, making Su Nantian feel somewhat ridiculous.

Was it necessary? Why turn a natural father-son relationship into such a class division?

“Master Nan, you don’t know. This time, Master Nan’s negotiation with Mr. Wu Chuan didn’t let him gain any advantage at all! He was extremely cautious!”

Su Nantian realized it was his turn to speak now that their main discussion had wrapped up.

He also wisely praised Nan Gong Ping and even included Nan Gong Lin in his commendation.

Indeed, upon hearing this, both Nan Gong Lin and Nan Gong Ping wore satisfied smiles.

No one would mind how high their hat was, just as no one would mind how many praises they received.

With Su Nantian’s words, the tense atmosphere eased, and everyone’s expressions relaxed. Especially Nan Gong Ping, whose tension seemed to be calmed by Su Nantian’s words.

“Good, you did well this time. Continue to strive and work harder, okay?”

Nan Gong Lin had maintained his high posture for a while. Finally, his tone softened. He looked at Nan Gong Ping with concern and added: “Wu Chuan is an old fox. One moment of carelessness, and you might fall into the trap he set.”

After saying this, Nan Gong Lin immediately continued: “When negotiating with him, if you have any questions, feel free to ask me anytime, okay?”

“Yes! Father!”

Nan Gong Ping instantly returned to his respectful demeanor. He quickly answered Nan Gong Lin, but Su Nantian knew that unless it was a critical situation, Nan Gong Ping would never ask Nan Gong Lin.

After all, this wetland bidding was a test given by Nan Gong Lin to Nan Gong Ping—testing whether he had the ability to become the next head of the Nan Gong family.

If even this test required relying on his father, Nan Gong Lin might reconsider his decision.

Therefore, unless it was the final step, Nan Gong Ping would never take this action.

“Good, you may leave.”

Seeing his son’s respectful attitude, Nan Gong Lin nodded in satisfaction. He waved his hand, signaling Nan Gong Ping to leave first.

Then he turned his gaze toward Su Nantian: “By the way, Nantian, right? Stay a moment. I have something to ask you.”

“Yes, Master.”

Su Nantian knew what Nan Gong Lin wanted to ask him. However, he didn’t show it but instead acted respectfully and answered.

Nan Gong Ping only glanced at Su Nantian with some curiosity but didn’t show much interest. He gave Su Nantian a meaningful look before leaving quickly.

After Nan Gong Ping left, Jin Guaji entered the room at that moment. He held a tray with a medicinal bowl on it.

“Master, this…”

Jin Guaji looked at Su Nantian and hesitated slightly before turning to Nan Gong Lin, as if waiting for his opinion.

Chapter 702: An Unexpected Event

“It’s fine, bring it over.”

Nan Gong Lin noticed Jin Guaji’s hesitation and waved his hand, directly ordering him to bring it over.

“He knows my condition. There’s no need to be cautious about him.”

When Jin Guaji still hesitated, Nan Gong Lin added.

Upon hearing this, Jin Guaji no longer delayed but brought the medicinal bowl over and skillfully lifted the lid to let it cool.

From Jin Guaji’s skilled movements, one could tell that Nan Gong Lin had been taking these tonics for a long time. Otherwise, Jin Guaji’s actions wouldn’t be so natural.

When the lid of the medicinal bowl was lifted, a strange and foul odor immediately spread out. Su Nantian instinctively frowned but quickly adjusted himself, not letting anyone notice.

Nan Gong Lin and Jin Guaji, accustomed to this strange smell every day, remained unaffected.

“Master, it’s ready to drink. It’s suitable for consumption.”

Jin Guaji respectfully took the spoon, stirred it slightly, and then pushed it forward a little to indicate that Nan Gong Lin could drink.

Su Nantian kept his gaze lowered, as if he hadn’t noticed anything. He didn’t let his eyes wander but remained低头, not looking at anything inappropriate.

However, Su Nantian inwardly shook his head, finding Nan Gong Lin’s actions somewhat ridiculous.

He couldn’t help but think that it was desperation, and even a wise person like Nan Gong Lin would believe in strange remedies under the torment of illness.

While Su Nantian was thinking these things, Nan Gong Lin had already finished the tonic. He wiped his mouth and waved for Jin Guaji to leave. After Jin Guaji left, Nan Gong Lin turned his gaze back to Su Nantian.

“I kept you here simply to learn some things from you.”

Nan Gong Lin spoke slowly, his tone gentle as if he were merely asking Su Nantian about some trivial matters.

But this was clearly not a normal conversation for anyone with eyes.

“Master, please ask freely. Whatever I know, I will tell you.”

Su Nantian continued to keep his gaze lowered and maintained a respectful demeanor. In reality, he was silently calculating the meaning behind Nan Gong Lin’s sudden decision to keep him.

“I recently heard from Ping that you have an unusual feeling for Wu You’er?”

After a brief pause, Nan Gong Lin suddenly spoke. His words almost made Su Nantian’s jaw drop.

“You don’t need to deny it immediately, nor do you think Ping gossiped. It was an accidental slip, and it’s not his fault.”

Seeing Su Nantian’s expression and the way he opened his mouth as if to explain, Nan Gong Lin interrupted him first.

Then he continued: “I know what you’re thinking. I’ve been through it myself. You are young men and women, at the peak of your hormones. I also heard Wu You’er is particularly beautiful.”

At this point, Nan Gong Lin paused and continued with a hint of mockery, as if teasing Su Nantian.

“A beautiful woman is the ideal for a gentleman. It’s natural that you feel something for her.”

Until this point, Nan Gong Lin’s expression was calm and even had a faint smile, as if he were an elder watching a younger person follow in his footsteps.

But the next moment, Nan Gong Lin’s expression darkened, and his tone dropped seriously: “Just remember your position. Don’t let women affect your future.”

In fact, this sentence was also a test and an attempt by Nan Gong Lin.

He had been silently observing Su Nantian’s expression, and if Su Nantian showed any sign of unease, Nan Gong Lin would immediately act to eliminate him.

Permanently.

Clearly, Su Nantian also understood what Nan Gong Lin was up to.

He slightly adjusted his mind and decided to play along, pretending to have a special feeling for Wu You’er.

He first deliberately showed an indecisive expression, then told Nan Gong Lin: “Master, you’re right. I always remember my identity and have no intention of betraying the Nan Gong family.”

After expressing his loyalty, Su Nantian continued with a hesitant tone: “But Master, feelings can’t be forced or controlled. I know the gap between us is vast. I’ve tried to suppress my feelings, but it seems they’ve failed.”

Su Nantian said this while feeling guilty and expressing deep feelings for Wu You’er: “Master, punish me!”

“Nantian, have you forgotten my words?”

Upon hearing Su Nantian’s admission of feelings, Nan Gong Lin’s gaze deepened slightly. However, his suspicion and doubt were dispelled to some extent.

“Since feelings can’t be forced, what’s wrong with it?”

After testing Su Nantian, Nan Gong Lin took another step.

But he didn’t expect that his strategies were no match for Su Nantian’s net, which was even set earlier.

In fact, every word and action of Nan Gong Lin at this moment was within Su Nantian’s expectations.

“Although I have a feud with Wu Chuan, I’m not entirely unreasonable. Wu You’er is Wu You’er. If you like her, go ahead and pursue her boldly.”

Chapter 703: Deliberate Testing

“You can choose freely.”

Nan Gong Lin said this as another test, trying to gauge how deep Su Nantian’s feelings for Wu You’er were.

“Alas, Master, don’t tease me anymore. I know my status. I’m just a small bodyguard. Wu You’er is the head of the Wu family, she’s high above me. How could she look down on someone like me? I won’t dare to humiliate myself.”

Su Nantian took the same approach he used with Nan Gong Ping and gave a perfunctory answer to Nan Gong Lin. However, he clearly knew the difference between Nan Gong Ping and Nan Gong Lin.

He showed his inferiority to Wu You’er in front of Nan Gong Ping, but the same words wouldn’t work with Nan Gong Lin, who was experienced.

Therefore, Su Nantian slightly adjusted his approach. He deliberately expressed some sarcastic remarks and portrayed himself as a toad dreaming of swan meat, loving Wu You’er more for the challenge and with a touch of inferiority toward her status.

It worked, earning Nan Gong Lin’s trust.

Nan Gong Lin’s gaze deepened slightly, and his lips even curled up slightly.

“Nonsense. You’re young but have such a mind. How could Wu You’er look down on you?”

This was it? Nan Gong Lin started to playact.

He kept encouraging Su Nantian to boldly pursue love and showed encouragement toward him.

Su Nantian seemed inspired by Nan Gong Lin’s words, showing eagerness to tell Wu You’er his true feelings.

“Alas, let it be. I’m not worthy of meeting Wu You’er. I won’t embarrass myself!”

Su Nantian waved his hand again, deliberately teasing Nan Gong Lin and not letting him succeed too quickly.

Indeed, upon hearing Su Nantian’s retreat again, Nan Gong Lin’s face flashed a hint of urgency.

“Didn’t I tell you not to belittle yourself?”

Nan Gong Lin looked at Su Nantian with a look of exasperation and said: “You don’t need to worry about meeting Wu You’er. There’s a wetland bidding conference in a week, and she’ll definitely attend with Wu Chuan. Then you’ll have the chance to meet.”

“Yes!”

Upon hearing Nan Gong Lin say this, Su Nantian showed a surprised smile and then asked with concern: “But such an important bidding conference, how can I, a servant, enter?”

Actually, this was Su Nantian’s main goal.

Su Nantian had long been worried about his status preventing him from openly attending the bidding conference and had been苦恼 about how to find a way. Unexpectedly, he found an opportunity by accident.

“Who said you couldn’t enter? You’ll be with me.”

Nan Gong Lin indeed gave Su Nantian the answer he wanted.

Then Nan Gong Lin began to reveal his purpose, deliberately using a persuasive tone to lure Su Nantian. He said: “You’ve always been concerned about Wu You’er’s status, thinking she’s high above and would look down on you. If that’s the case, why not bring her to an equal level? Then she won’t be able to look down on you.”

The implication was clear: Nan Gong Lin wanted Su Nantian to help take down the Wu family. Only when the Wu family became a gift for the Nan Gong family would Wu You’er fall from her pedestal.

At that time, they would be equals.

“Yes! How didn’t I think of it!”

Su Nantian also played along, showing a surprised smile as if enlightened. He suddenly had an epiphany: “Master, you’re truly wise! Thank you for reminding me!”

“Ha ha, I just wanted to see lovers finally get together. You don’t need to thank me.”

Seeing Su Nantian fully caught in his trap, Nan Gong Lin’s smile became more evident. Initially, he thought Su Nantian was a wild horse that could easily lose everything if not careful.

Nan Gong Lin had been troubled about what to use to control Su Nantian and make him willingly serve the Nan Gong family.

Unexpectedly, he had a stroke of luck and solved his concerns.

As the old saying goes, “A soft bed is a hero’s tomb.”

With Wu You’er as the bait, Su Nantian would surely use all his strength and serve the Nan Gong family diligently.

“Alright, you may leave.”

Now that his goal was achieved, Nan Gong Lin didn’t have much energy left for Su Nantian.

He waved his hand, signaling Su Nantian to leave, and added a teasing remark: “I believe good news will come soon.”

On the other hand, after leaving Nan Gong Lin’s room, Su Nantian’s lips slightly curled into a mocking arc. He turned his head to look behind him, his eyes filled with clear mockery and disdain.

It seemed Nan Gong Lin was becoming increasingly weak.

Now he was resorting to such underhanded methods, even using love and relationships as tools.

Because of this, Su Nantian was more certain that the Nan Gong family’s fate had come to an end. The hundreds of years of prosperity and foundation would soon be lost in Nan Gong Lin’s generation.

But what did it have to do with him?

He just needed to complete the task and then leave without looking back. Whether it was the Nan Gong family or anyone else, none of it had anything to do with him.

Su Nantian thought this and gradually composed his expression. He looked up at the sky, seeing it was bright and clear with no clouds.

It seemed he should hurry up and complete his task quickly.

But Su Nantian didn’t realize that he had already lost this opportunity and was given no chance to recover. No matter how angry or unwilling he was, he could only leave defeated.

“Hey! Su Nantian!”

Su Nantian composed his thoughts and headed toward his room. But after taking a few steps, he heard a familiar female voice.

In the Nan Gong family, besides Nan Gong Yu Yan, there was no other girl. Even if there were, no one would call Su Nantian like this.

Su Nantian sighed helplessly and moved his lips, even though he was unwilling, he had to reluctantly turn around to answer this high-ranking lady.

“Miss Nan, what do you need?”

Su Nantian returned to his usual manner of speaking and respectfully addressed Nan Gong Yu Yan.

In reality, he was mentally cursing her, hoping she would speak quickly and get it over with so he could attend to more important matters.

Actually, Su Nantian couldn’t understand why the intelligent and elegant Nan Gong Yu Yan always acted like a spoiled princess in front of him.

Chapter 704: Obstacle

“Nothing, Miss Nan, please speak.”

Before Nan Gong Yu Yan could speak, Su Nantian continued with a neutral expression. After saying this, he looked at Nan Gong Yu Yan with an innocent face, and all his actions were just right.

And Su Nantian’s every move left Nan Gong Yu Yan with no room for criticism.

So when she saw Su Nantian, she was momentarily stunned and took a deep breath to calm herself before regaining her composure.

“What? Are you not happy to see me?”

Nan Gong Yu Yan didn’t know if she was intentionally looking for trouble. Her eyebrows furrowed, and she bit her lower lip with dissatisfaction before speaking in an annoyed tone: “Are you嫌弃 me?”

After saying this, Nan Gong Yu Yan glared at Su Nantian with a pout, almost putting her hands on her hips.

“Or do you think I’m not worthy of calling your name?”

Nan Gong Yu Yan was getting more unreasonable, making Su Nantian feel a headache.

“No, Miss Nan misunderstood.”

Su Nantian忍住 his helplessness and replied with a neutral expression. He wasn’t a fool, so he wouldn’t reveal his true thoughts. That would be seeking trouble.

“Miss Nan, please speak.”

After saying this, Su Nantian continued to look at Nan Gong Yu Yan with his eyes lowered, patiently waiting for her to speak.

“I… I just… um…”

But when Su Nantian patiently waited for Nan Gong Yu Yan’s instructions, she suddenly hesitated. She paused for a while and then fidgeted but said nothing.

This behavior made Su Nantian even more helpless, and even though he was angry, he couldn’t vent it on Nan Gong Yu Yan.

He had other important matters to attend to and didn’t have time to waste with this spoiled Miss Nan.

Thinking about it, even though Su Nantian was trying to suppress it, his tone inevitably carried a slight stiffness.

“Miss Nan, please speak directly. If it’s within my ability, I will do my part.”

Su Nantian said this and added: “I need to report something important to Master Nan soon.”

The implication was clear—he was busy and had no time to waste with Miss Nan.

“What do you mean?”

Su Nantian’s words made Nan Gong Yu Yan angry immediately. She glared at him with indignation and puffed out her cheeks, saying: “You’re upset with me, aren’t you!”

“I… this…”

Su Nantian felt even more helpless upon hearing this and wondered what to do with Nan Gong Yu Yan. If he could choose, he would wish he hadn’t taken this path. That way, he wouldn’t have met Nan Gong Yu Yan or endured her nonsense.

“You what? You don’t need to hide it! I’m not patient enough, but you use my brother to pressure me? What’s so special about it! Hmph!”

Nan Gong Yu Yan interrupted Su Nantian again, then angrily said a sentence and huffed, walking away.

Her back was潇洒, but poor Su Nantian.

He had been inexplicably blocked and then inexplicably scolded.

At this moment, Su Nantian was completely confused and felt莫名其妙. This Nan Gong Yu Yan must have been too good at hiding, no one noticed she was just a spoiled princess!

And she always acted like this in front of him, making him helpless every time.

Seeing Nan Gong Yu Yan leave with a huff, Su Nantian felt he was extremely unlucky today. He also felt helpless and didn’t know what this Miss Nan was thinking, why she suddenly appeared in front of him, spoke a bunch of nonsense, and then scolded him.

Did she get angry elsewhere and was venting on him?

But Su Nantian quickly shook his head, dismissing the thoughts and pushing this small incident out of his mind. He didn’t continue to dwell on it because he had a more important matter to attend to and had no time to ponder this spoiled princess.

After all, in Su Nantian’s view, if Nan Gong Yu Yan truly had something important to say, she would have spoken clearly. She wouldn’t have appeared like this and then disappeared without a trace.

After thinking about it, Su Nantian no longer dwelled on this matter. He quickened his pace and left quickly, fearing that the angry Nan Gong Yu Yan would return and torment his ears again.

Su Nantian had thought that encountering the unexpected Nan Gong Yu Yan in the morning was enough bad luck, but he didn’t know that even worse things were waiting for him.

Indeed! After Su Nantian passed through another courtyard, he met an extremely annoying obstacle!

And this person was Nan Gong Fei, the cousin of the Nan Gong family.

Su Nantian saw the person approaching and immediately muttered “bad luck” in his heart, then wanted to turn back. But it was too late—Nan Gong Fei had already clearly seen Su Nantian and greeted him warmly.

“Ah, it’s you, Nantian.”

Perhaps because he had already exposed his true face at the restaurant before, Nan Gong Fei no longer pretended to be crazy or foolish. Instead, he looked at Su Nantian with a sharp and clear gaze.

His eyes were piercing and obvious, as if he had instantly become an X-ray machine, scanning Su Nantian from the inside out.

Nan Gong Fei first greeted Su Nantian warmly, then directly asked: “How about it, Nantian? I’ve given you several days to think. I think this period has been enough for you to decide, right?”

Nan Gong Fei said this while looking at Su Nantian with a sharp gaze, his expression full of implications. He waited for Su Nantian to give an answer while also threatening him.

“Although I am a lazy and indulgent playboy in my usual life, you know that. My patience is the same as what I show every day. I’ve waited for you so long, and it’s time for you to give me a clear answer.”

Nan Gong Fei said this and then continued: “You know, I have an urgent important matter waiting for you to do. So, you should…”

Nan Gong Fei stopped here and intentionally left the rest of his sentence unsaid, to let Su Nantian think it through. He hoped Su Nantian would imagine something terrible.

Chapter 705: The Accurate Answer

“How about it? Have you decided?”

Nan Gong Fei asked again, his eyes filled with terrifying light. No one dared to meet his gaze.

And Nan Gong Fei’s current appearance was nothing like the promise he had made before. No matter what answer Su Nantian gave, whether helping him or refusing, he wouldn’t be angry.

Clearly, he now showed that Su Nantian had only one choice: to agree to help him and do it well!

Since Nan Gong Fei had already made his intentions so clear, Su Nantian naturally couldn’t continue to pretend. Also, he knew that arguing with Nan Gong Fei would only backfire. So he prepared to make a statement.

After all, Su Nantian had his own important matters to attend to at this time.

Moreover, although Nan Gong Fei hadn’t yet clearly stated what he wanted Su Nantian to do, Su Nantian had already vaguely guessed.

Nan Gong Fei hadn’t made it clear, but he had hinted enough.

What else could be described as “urgent and important” besides the wetland bidding?

And what else was worth Nan Gong Fei’s effort to expose his true face in front of the enemy?

Therefore, Nan Gong Fei had already lost from the start. He couldn’t outwit Su Nantian.

In fact, this so-called wetland bidding plan was just a fatal temptation for the major families. For Su Nantian, it had no meaning at all.

His original mission was to take Wu You’er and her parents out.

So, who won the bidding didn’t matter to Su Nantian. He didn’t care and wouldn’t get involved, because this was why he had been moving between the Nan Gong family and Wu’s family.

He could easily promise to help them, no matter what.

After all, it had nothing to do with him. And Su Nantian had already decided: as long as he rescued Wu You’er and her parents, he would complete the mission and leave the Nan Gong family, staying away from their internal conflicts.

All in all, it was to find Wu You’er’s location as soon as possible and where her parents were now. Only then could he complete the mission quickly and leave the Nan Gong family and their internal conflicts!

“Cousin, even if you hadn’t come to find me today, I was planning to look for you.”

At this point, Su Nantian no longer hid or concealed anything. He directly looked at Nan Gong Fei and spoke just as he did: “I agree to help you.”
