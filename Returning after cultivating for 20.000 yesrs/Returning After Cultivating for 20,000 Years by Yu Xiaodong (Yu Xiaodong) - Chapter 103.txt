Hence, these two brothers remain fixated on casting their votes for Wu Ruotian.

“Ah, I see you two are unaware of Wu Chuan’s increased stakes. Moreover, the contract has already been signed. Thus, all you need to do is follow suit and you will still receive considerable benefits. Three-quarters of the inland port has already been allocated to the Nan Gong family. Calculate how much you will gain.”

He unhesitatingly revealed the contract details discussed between Nan Gong Yuyan and Wu Chuan to the Huang family. He did not fear their knowledge, for even if they discovered it, nothing would change—only by informing them of the current conditions would these two finally安心 (calmly) align with the Nan Gong family’s vote for Wu Chuan.

“Three-quarters? That’s impossible! I don’t believe Wu Chuan would be so generous. The Wu family’s primary revenue source is the inland port, with other industries being secondary. Allocating such a vast proportion to the Nan Gong family—do they intend to starve this year?” Huang Zhiwei and Huang Zhizhong both wore expressions of disbelief.

To cede such a massive enterprise to the Nan Gong family, even if only for one year, would allow them to widen their gap with other families significantly.

“I know you find it hard to believe, but this is the truth. I was present when they signed the contract; every clause was clearly etched into my mind, and both have affixed their seals without hesitation.”

“I understand. We will vote for Wu Chuan. Moreover, given this situation, as long as the Nan Gong family continues to support Wu Chuan, we have no reason to cast our votes elsewhere. If we were to act differently from the Nan Gong family, it would only raise their suspicions.”

Huang Zhizhong could only nod in agreement. Up until now, they could not show the slightest resistance toward the Nan Gong family. Though they had long planned to break free from their grasp, now was not the time. To reveal their rebellious intent prematurely would only see them crushed in infancy.

Furthermore, Huang Zhizhong sensed that the Nan Gong family had already begun to watch them closely over these past two years. Core discussions and participation in critical matters had gradually excluded members of the Huang family.

At the same time, the Nan Gong family’s control over certain aspects of the Huang family had tightened increasingly. From both sides’ perspectives, they each understood that their cooperation would not last long.

The Nan Gong family sought continued control over the Huang family, even if they could not fully dominate them, they aimed to extract one final profit. Conversely, the Huang family needed to completely sever ties with the Nan Gong family while maximizing their assets’ survival.

Yet, despite this, both families maintained a facade of past harmony.

Chapter 507: Evening Attire

After informing the Huang family about this matter, Su Nantian did not linger. After clarifying the situation, he immediately returned to the Nan Gong family’s room.

After Nan Gong Yuyan called him back, she said: “How did it go? Have you informed the Huang family?”

“Yes, Miss. I have told them everything. They know this time they will still vote for Wu Chuan, and there will be no mistake.” Su Nantian nodded immediately and replied.

Nan Gong Yuyan nodded in response, but then added: “It seems Brother Wu Chuan will not awaken anytime soon. Therefore, I shall attend the evening banquet alone tonight. However, the banquet may not be peaceful. To ensure my safety, you should not stay here; accompany me to the banquet.”

“Ah?” Su Nantian replied thus, not out of surprise or reluctance, but because Nan Gong Yuyan’s words aligned with his own desires.

In fact, when he returned, he had also been concerned—Wu Chuan appeared unable to awaken, and even if he did, it was unlikely he would be able to attend the banquet immediately.

Thus, Su Nantian had worried that he would have to stay and watch over Wu Chuan, preventing him from attending the banquet to see Wu You’er.

But Su Nantian had not anticipated that Nan Gong Yuyan would open a convenient path for him, exactly what he desired.

“Why are you so loyal to your brother? You do not wish to protect me?” Nan Gong Yuyan, upon hearing Su Nantian’s response, thought he was reluctant to go.

“Of course not! I am willing to go. It was merely a moment of surprise. After all, your entourage is full of talent; it is surprising that you would call me at this time.” Su Nantian quickly fabricated a suitable excuse and replied.

“You may have many talents, but none surpass you. The position of our family’s top bodyguard is now yours. You have defeated Zhang Yu and Zeng Chao within the Nan Gong family, making you virtually unbeatable. Thus, it is only natural to entrust this great bodyguard with my safety.”

“Moreover, Wu Chuan’s people are still patrolling. I believe the perpetrators would also hesitate to act against Brother Wu Chuan again. Furthermore, they were after the voting matter; tonight is the crucial time. At that moment, all focus will be within the banquet hall, and this place would actually be safe. That is why I am confident in sending you to my side.”

Nan Gong Yuyan reiterated her current thoughts. Su Nantian felt she was indeed correct, but he knew the truth more intimately—knowing that the perpetrators were from the Huang family and that they had no intention of harming Wu Chuan. Thus, Su Nantian knew with certainty that Wu Chuan would be safe tonight.

“I will certainly protect you well, Miss.” Su Nantian said earnestly.

After a series of events, time eventually passed and the evening banquet arrived.

Su Nantian also changed into a new uniform to match the occasion. Previously, he had worn standard bodyguard attire—identical to the black suits and white shirts seen on television.

However, for this banquet, Nan Gong Yuyan provided him with another set of clothes. Upon opening the gift box, he discovered a luxurious velvet sapphire-blue suit.

Su Nantian looked up at Nan Gong Yuyan in surprise and said: “Miss, I am merely a bodyguard. Is it not too extravagant for me to wear this?”

Nan Gong Yuyan only smiled. “You are not merely a bodyguard of the Nan Gong family; you also represent its image. Everyone’s attendants will be dressed more elegantly than usual tonight. The Nan Gong family certainly cannot falter; otherwise, how would we demonstrate our status? This suit is perfectly suited for you. However, the size remains uncertain—someone simply grabbed a standard size. Now go try it on to see how it looks.”

After saying this, Nan Gong Yuyan pointed toward the room and instructed Su Nantian to enter. He nodded and carried the suit into the room.

“Unexpectedly, one must always dress so formally.” Su Nantian muttered in吐槽 (sarcasm), then began changing his suit.

After Su Nantian had changed, he felt the suit fit well—his physique was indeed well-maintained.

However, when Su Nantian stepped out of the room, Nan Gong Yuyan instinctively looked up and was immediately struck speechless upon seeing Su Nantian in his new attire.

For now, Su Nantian appeared extremely noble and luxurious—more like a wealthy aristocrat than a bodyguard.

Although his face was now an altered one, and he had deliberately transformed it into a rural boy’s appearance, his physique and demeanor could not be changed. Wearing this suit made every movement he made exude the aura of a top-tier aristocrat—undoubtedly not a bodyguard from the countryside.

“Miss? How does this suit look on me? Have I embarrassed you?” Su Nantian asked Nan Gong Yuyan.

But Nan Gong Yuyan remained staring at Su Nantian without recovering, until Su Nantian waved his hand before her face. Nan Gong Yuyan finally regained composure.

“What… what did you say?” Nan Gong Yuyan’s face was slightly flushed as she asked.

Su Nantian smiled, “I said whether I have embarrassed you. This suit should fit well, as it is the first time I’ve worn such a fine suit.”

“It’s quite good… this suit suits you well…” Nan Gong Yuyan said, then immediately shifted her gaze away from Su Nantian, fearing that if she looked again, she would once more fall into that embarrassing state.

Su Nantian, experienced in romance, could not miss the current state of Nan Gong Yuyan—especially that suspicious flush on her face, which indicated at least a slight infatuation toward himself.

Yet Su Nantian was not yet ready for romance, as the most pressing matter before him remained how to rescue Wu You’er and Wu Tao’s couple.

If this failed, even if he had a hundred of the most exquisite beauties, Su Nantian would have no desire to indulge.

“Alright, now you should tidy up quickly; we will head to the banquet site shortly.” Nan Gong Yuyan said and immediately instructed her assistant to bring her evening gown.

Chapter 508: The Banquet

After Nan Gong Yuyan changed into her evening gown, Su Nantian could not help but admire her in his heart. Naturally, Nan Gong Yuyan was beautiful; usually dressed in professional attire, her beauty did not shine through—only a cold elegance. However, now, after changing into this dazzling evening gown, she appeared like a gentle princess.

“Alright, we should go now.” But Nan Gong Yuyan’s words still carried that cold demeanor.

Thus, Su Nantian followed behind Nan Gong Yuyan and her assistant toward the banquet site.

This time, the venue was not the same as where they had initially arrived but rather beneath Wu’s family. Beneath Wu’s estate lay a vast banquet hall, the venue for such formal gatherings.

Upon arriving, Su Nantian could not help but admire the opulence of Wu’s underground banquet hall.

The entire floor was paved with the finest marble, and the ceiling was adorned with the most luxurious crystal chandeliers. The materials were entirely custom-made for Wu’s family, unlike ordinary home decorations.

Su Nantian marveled inwardly—such a standard for Wu’s banquet hall, and the Nan Gong family must be even more luxurious.

These past few days, although he had remained within the Nan Gong family, it was only in Wu Ping’s small villa. He had never fully explored the entire Nan Gong family, so he was unaware of many things within it.

However, by scale alone, the Nan Gong family still surpassed Wu’s. Each person had their own private villa instead of all residing in a single estate.

Moreover, Su Nantian had visited Nan Gong Lin’s villa; its scale was several times more luxurious than Wu Ping’s. However, Nan Gong Lin’s villa maintained an ancient style, continuing the standards of their family when they were emperors.

Thus, this ancient imperial style did not dazzle as much as the Western-style opulence at first glance. But if compared to a larger scene, Su Nantian believed the Nan Gong family’s style would be even more luxurious.

When Nan Gong Yuyan and her group arrived, Wu Chuan immediately approached with a smile, saying: “Ah, Miss Nan Gong has arrived. I have been waiting for you all this time.”

Nan Gong Yuyan smiled in return. “Uncle Wu, why the rush? Those who are meant to come will arrive; what is yours will not escape.”

It seemed Wu Chuan, despite having signed a contract with Nan Gong Yuyan, still felt some trepidation. Thus, he had been waiting for her arrival to find reassurance within his heart.

“Hahahaha, it seems I was the one who rushed. Your seats are this way; they have already been arranged for you.” Wu Chuan said, guiding Nan Gong Yuyan and her group inside.

This time was not a large round table but rather each family had its own designated place, not mixed together.

After Nan Gong Yuyan and her group sat down, Su Nantian stood respectfully behind her.

At the same time, the Huang family had already raised their glasses toward Nan Gong Yuyan, and Huang Zhizhong’s gaze naturally fell upon Su Nantian behind her. Su Nantian nodded slightly toward Huang Zhizhong and Huang Zhiwei.

Meanwhile, a discordant voice entered Su Nantian’s ears—though only he could hear it. Nan Gong Yuyan likely could not, as Su Nantian had heightened his senses upon entering to discern the current state of the major families.

“This Wu Chuan is truly untrustworthy; he is so attentive to Nan Gong Yuyan now. It must be telling us he will no longer cooperate with us.” This voice was unmistakably that of Wang’s young master.

“Seems we’ve bet on the wrong horse. We never expected Wu Chuan to finally hesitate to take this step. In his eyes, the alliance between Nan Gong and Huang is more stable and can secure his victory this time. However, now everyone knows that the Huang family has already harbored rebellious thoughts toward Nan Gong; they are merely maintaining appearances for now.”

The one speaking was the Wang family’s assistant, who had not originally accompanied the young master. He had only joined with the main group of bodyguards after the incident involving Wu Ping. It seemed that Wang’s patriarch had not trusted his son and thus sent this capable assistant along.

“What if we’ve come in vain? Even if we know the deal won’t go through, we cannot align with others. In that case, it would only offend Wu Chuan; they are so shrewd and will not cooperate with us.” Wang’s young master said again, frustrated.

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian nodded in agreement, as the Wang young master was indeed correct. If Song family knew Wu Chuan would not cooperate with them, they would still not align with Wang to vote for others. They knew that, given Wu Chuan’s current status, even in the case of a tie, he could easily ensure his chosen heir would be elected.

As for Song family’s usual style, they were extremely shrewd. Even if this cooperation failed, they would not offend Wu Chuan, as in the future, since Wu Chuan could appoint his own person to become the head of Wu family, then the entire Wu family would be under Wu Chuan’s control. Thus, Song family would never plant such a bomb for themselves.

But Song family would also not readily support their votes to Wu Chuan, as they had already failed in business and would not want to give away for free. They would instead vote for someone else, but this would not offend Wu Chuan.

While Su Nantian observed the scene, he noticed several people arriving at a table ahead. Upon focusing his gaze, he recognized them as the candidates for Wu family’s heir—Wu You’er and Wu Ruotian.

It seemed this banquet would soon officially begin, with people arriving one by one. Meanwhile, Wu family’s servants had already started serving the dishes on their tables.

Su Nantian glanced at the exquisite food laid out before him, each dish exuding luxury and appetite—no less than a Michelin-starred restaurant.

Chapter 509: The Result

After everything was arranged, Wu Chuan stepped onto the stage again. After all, he was currently the head of Wu family and would be fully responsible for internal matters until a new heir was chosen.

“Thank you all for staying in our Wu family these past few days, working tirelessly to determine the heir. Additionally, I must apologize to the Nan Gong family. We did not expect such unforeseen circumstances that caused harm to Master Wu Ping. However, after examination, it has been confirmed that Master Wu Ping is in good health. I would like to apologize to everyone who was frightened.”

Wu Chuan’s tone was very sincere, and after speaking, he bowed on stage. This was somewhat inconsistent with his usual image—generally, Wu Chuan had always been seen as a man who did not easily bow to others.

“Now, I hope you can cast your votes for the heir based on your observations over these past few days. Your votes will largely determine who becomes our next Wu family heir.”

After speaking, Wu Chuan clapped his hands, and the servants of Wu family pushed a box onto the stage—evidently this year’s voting box.

“Please cast your votes in order: Wang family, Huang family, Song family, and Nan Gong family.” Wu Chuan said, nodding to each of the families in turn, indicating they could now begin voting.

Thus, Wang’s young master, Huang Zhizhong, Song Yaoyuan, and Nan Gong Yuyan each stepped onto the stage in turn to place their pre-written ballots into the box.

After voting was completed, Wu Chuan unexpectedly said: “This time, we will not play games; we will count the votes right here and announce the final result.”

Upon hearing this, Nan Gong Yuyan frowned slightly and whispered: “Wu Chuan is too hasty.”

Not only was Nan Gong Yuyan’s reaction this way, but others also shared the same sentiment. Su Nantian only then realized that in other families, voting was not publicly counted; they would wait until leaving before checking the results.

After voting, it became Wu family’s own affair; however, Wu Chuan now wanted to confirm the result in front of all families. This revealed Wu Chuan’s eagerness for Wu You’er to become the heir.

In fact, this also inadvertently exposed Wu Chuan’s greatest fear—that he was an adopted son. Only when Wu You’er, as his puppet, officially became the heir could he effectively control the family and maintain power under the guise of relinquishing it.

However, after publicly counting the votes, the result indeed aligned with his wishes—Nan Gong and Huang families both voted for Wu You’er.

As for the Wang family and Song family, each had cast a vote for Wu Yu and Wu Feng respectively. Wu Ruotian received no votes at all.

As Wu Chuan happily announced the result and invited everyone to enjoy the banquet’s delicacies, then submit the voting results to Wu family elders, Wu Ruotian seemed greatly stimulated.

He saw Wu Ruotian’s shoulders trembling continuously before he stood up, turning to point at the Huang family’s position and addressing Huang Zhizhong and Huang Zhiwei: “You two brothers have truly deceived me well. We had already agreed that you would vote for me, but now I received no votes at all. How do you explain this?”

Su Nantian was genuinely shocked by this scene. He had previously thought Wu Ruotian was wise, but now he realized the man had merely been making empty promises.

Now it seemed Wu Ruotian’s promises of Wu family’s submission and oil field distribution to the Huang brothers were merely his way of listing all the chips he currently possessed or could potentially possess.

However, Wu Ruotian’s outburst certainly made the atmosphere extremely awkward, as everyone knew that behind the scenes they had all been negotiating with each other to find conditions suitable for their families, hoping to gain benefits from this Wu family heir selection. But no one expected Wu Ruotian to bring the issue into the open.

The most awkward part was that everyone knew the Huang family had always followed Nan Gong’s votes, but this time they had secretly accepted others’ conditions and agreed to it—this was the most amusing part of the situation.

Other families were now all watching with amusement, as this at least proved that the Huang family had once considered not voting for Nan Gong.

Behind this, whether it could prove that the Huang family had already harbored resentment toward Nan Gong was unclear. However, each family now was watching the spectacle and even some had already started scheming in their minds.

If the Huang family truly wanted to break free from Nan Gong, offering them benefits could possibly gain an ally. Moreover, having collaborated with Nan Gong for so many years, even if they could not find any leverage against them, they had a rich understanding of their internal patterns. Thus, knowing these details would make it easier to deal with Nan Gong in the future.

At this moment, Huang Zhizhong and Huang Zhiwei both appeared very frightened, immediately standing up and saying: “We never promised you anything. You merely came to negotiate with us, but the Huang family did not agree to your proposal. How can you assume that our previous discussions equate to a promise from us?”

Huang Zhizhong was clearly trying to salvage the situation. He certainly did not want Nan Gong family to know about this, but now Wu Ruotian had unexpectedly become so aggressive and brought the issue into the open.

At this moment, Nan Gong Yuyan remained as composed as before, but her face had clearly turned dark.

If Wu Ruotian’s claim was true and the Huang family had indeed agreed to it, then Nan Gong Yuyan could certainly conclude that the Huang family was now preparing to break free from her Nan Gong family.

Chapter 510: Secret Meeting

Huang Zhizhong and Huang Zhiwei were both extremely anxious due to Wu Ruotian’s words, as they had now seen Nan Gong Yuyan’s face turn dark.

In fact, if someone had approached them, it would not be a problem—after all, everyone brings their conditions to try and exchange for votes. However, Wu Ruotian had said that he had already reached an agreement with Huang Zhizhong and Huang Zhiwei, which meant that they had planned to betray Nan Gong family.

At this moment, Wu Chuan also noticed Nan Gong Yuyan’s darkened expression. Although he wanted to watch the scene, he had now allied with Nan Gong family, and Wu Ruotian was part of his Wu family. Thus, he had to intervene to stop it.

So Wu Chuan stepped forward and scolded Wu Ruotian: “Wu Ruotian, don’t disgrace us. It’s a complete embarrassment for our Wu family! Guards, take him away!”

As Wu Chuan spoke, everyone rushed forward to carry Wu Ruotian out. Wu Ruotian struggled desperately but could not match their strength, and was forcibly carried away.

Wu Chuan could only awkwardly smile at the crowd and said: “Forgive me, everyone. I did not expect such an incident to occur. After all, it involves the matter of our Wu family heir selection; they are sensitive individuals, and I am truly sorry.”

Wu Chuan’s intervention effectively relieved the Huang family. After all, now other families were watching; if Wu Ruotian continued to cause trouble, only the Huang family would lose face.

Although Nan Gong family would be embarrassed, no one would mock them openly; they would only speak ill of them behind their backs.

With Wu Chuan’s intervention and Wu Ruotian being taken away, the scene eventually regained order. Huang Zhizhong and Huang Zhiwei also sat down awkwardly, but they could not explain themselves due to the current situation.

Thus, the banquet continued, although everyone’s minds were elsewhere because Wu Chuan had already announced the vote count. This effectively represented that Wu You’er, whom he controlled, had become the heir of Wu family.

Their purpose for coming here was now complete; everyone was thinking about returning to their families immediately.

At this moment, while the chaos continued, Wu You’er also turned to glance at Su Nantian and exchanged a look. Then Wu You’er excused herself, saying she needed to go to the restroom.

At the same time, Su Nantian said to Nan Gong Yuyan: “Miss, I need to go to the restroom. I’ll be back shortly.”

Although this behavior was unprofessional for a bodyguard, Nan Gong Yuyan had no time to care about Su Nantian’s actions and waved him off casually, indicating he should hurry.

Thus, Su Nantian immediately followed Wu You’er out. No one would connect them in the crowd, as from others’ perspectives, they were strangers with no connection.

Because everyone was inside the banquet hall, there were no guards outside.

Su Nantian immediately led Wu You’er into the restroom. He did not want to have this conversation here, but under these circumstances, it was their only opportunity.

Su Nantian thoroughly checked the restroom and then locked the door.

At this moment, Wu You’er said anxiously: “What should I do? Now I have truly become the heir of Wu family. Do I really have to stay here for two years? Wu Chuan said he would let me hand over the family head position to him after two years, then release me and my parents.”

“Absolutely not! I will not let you stay in Wu family for two years. Moreover, although Wu Chuan said that after two years he would let you hand over the position and then release you, it is definitely not like that. Furthermore, don’t forget—whether Wu family acknowledges him as an adopted son is the most critical issue.”

Su Nantian and Wu You’er immediately got to the point without any small talk, as they both knew their time was limited. If they wasted it on pleasantries, they would not reach the key points.

“Although I have only been in Wu family for a short time, through what I’ve experienced these two days and what my father told me before, it is clear that Wu family values bloodline greatly.

Someone who is not of Wu family—only my grandfather’s adopted son—would definitely not be recognized. Otherwise, his current power would already allow him to inherit Wu family. But now he has me as a puppet, which is for his own legitimate exercise of power.”

Su Nantian had not expected Wu You’er to have learned so much during his stay in Wu family. He felt a sense of relief, surprised that he could gather such information under these circumstances.

“Absolutely do not trust Wu Chuan’s two-year promise. We must find a way to rescue you and your parents. Even if you truly agreed to let him take the position after two years, if Wu family’s conservative elders disagree, it means you will be a puppet for Wu Chuan forever. Your family of three’s freedom would be meaningless.”

Wu You’er was also very anxious and asked anxiously: “Then what can we do to rescue me and my parents?”

After saying this, she looked at Su Nantian with a hopeful gaze.

Su Nantian shook his head: “I have not yet thought of a specific plan, but I am already laying the groundwork for this future plan. Therefore, during your time in Wu family, do not panic. Now that you have become the heir of Wu family, you are also the future head of Wu family. Thus, you currently have a bargaining chip to negotiate with Wu Chuan.

But do not provoke him; as long as you have this identity, you are safe. Do not push him to the point of mutual destruction. You can appropriately negotiate with him, allowing you to meet your parents more often and confirm their safety while maintaining communication.”

Although Su Nantian did not have a specific plan at this moment, he was indeed laying the groundwork as he had said. Once these preparations were complete, when a reasonable plan and timing came, it would be effortless to rescue Wu Tao’s couple and Wu You’er. Thus, at this moment, the most important thing for him was to gain Wu You’er’s trust.

Chapter 511: Returning to the Nan Gong Family

After hearing Su Nantian’s words, Wu You’er nodded and said seriously: “Su Nantian, I believe in you. I am waiting for you here.”

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian smiled but also knew that the time he and Wu You’er had to talk was limited.

He immediately said: “In any case, just believe I am always looking for a way to rescue you. And I believe it will succeed eventually. Now, I am working as a bodyguard in the Nan Gong family. And after this, since the Nan Gong family and Wu family have a very close cooperation, there will be plenty of opportunities to interact with the Wu family.

As the nominal next head of Wu family, you will certainly have to attend some events; Wu Chuan cannot lock you up. Thus, your task is to always know where your parents are so we can rescue you.”

After saying this, he heard the door being knocked. A voice from outside said: “Miss, are you in there? Miss? You said you needed to go to the restroom. It has been a while now; are you okay inside?”

Upon hearing this voice, Wu You’er immediately said to Su Nantian: “It’s the nurse who takes care of me.”

Su Nantian nodded to her and whispered: “I’m leaving now. Just act naturally.”

After saying this, Su Nantian directly headed toward the window of the restroom. He had checked the adjacent men’s restroom and found a window open here. If he could jump over it, he could exit from the other side.

With his skills, this was an extremely simple task. Thus, he jumped from the women’s restroom window to the other side. Fortunately, there was no one in the adjacent men’s restroom, so no one noticed him.

Su Nantian then confidently walked out of the men’s restroom and saw a middle-aged woman knocking on the door outside. This was the nurse who Wu You’er had mentioned earlier.

Su Nantian adjusted his clothes and returned to the banquet hall. He had been away for nearly ten minutes, and Nan Gong Yuyan might have already suspected something.

After Su Nantian returned, Nan Gong Yuyan immediately asked: “What happened? Why did you take so long?”

Su Nantian could only smile helplessly and said: “Sorry, Miss. I think I ate something bad.”

Nan Gong Yuyan did not say much upon hearing this. After all, people have their needs; it was beyond their control. If he had truly eaten something bad, it would be understandable. Ten minutes was not long, but for them, a bodyguard leaving his master for ten minutes was a dereliction of duty.

However, Nan Gong Yuyan was not in the mood to bother with Su Nantian at this moment. She was more concerned about the Huang family’s situation, so this matter passed without further comment. And within those ten minutes, nothing had happened.

After the banquet ended, each family prepared to drive away from Wu’s estate. The Nan Gong family also sent a private car to pick up Wu Ping.

Wu Chuan had not yet found the perpetrators, but he was now allied with Nan Gong family. Thus, this matter had effectively been put to rest.

As the men of the Nan Gong family carried Wu Ping onto their specially arranged ambulance, Wu Chuan still apologized to Nan Gong Yuyan: “This time, we have indeed suffered a loss. We deeply apologize for the inconvenience and harm caused to the Nan Gong family. However, we hope there will be opportunities in the future to make amends.”

Nan Gong Yuyan smiled upon hearing this and said: “But I must congratulate Uncle Wu Chuan for finally achieving his goal. The follow-up cooperation will be contacted by someone, and we shall meet again.”

After saying this, Nan Gong Yuyan got into the car. As a bodyguard of Wu Ping, Su Nantian naturally followed Wu Ping’s vehicle away.

Su Nantian sat in the ambulance, watching Wu Ping lying on a stretcher and sighed with relief. This trip to Wu family had not gone as planned, rescuing Wu You’er and Wu Tao’s couple. However, he had gathered a lot of information.

Moreover, Su Nantian now had a general plan in his mind, knowing which direction he should proceed to safely rescue Wu You’er and Wu Tao’s couple.

However, at the same time, Su Nantian knew that although he had safely navigated Wu family’s affairs, returning to the Nan Gong family would surely bring punishment. Nan Gong Lin would definitely not let this mistake go unpunished.

Although on the surface, he had done everything possible, and the fault lay with Wu Ping for opening the door and leaving on his own, Nan Gong Lin would not blame Wu Ping.

Furthermore, Su Nantian had previously injured Zeng Chao and Zhang Yu; although Nan Gong Lin could acknowledge his skills, he still harbored some resentment toward Su Nantian. Thus, this opportunity would definitely allow him to punish Su Nantian thoroughly.

However, Su Nantian had prepared for this. No matter what, he must stay in the Nan Gong family to have the opportunity to rescue Wu You’er and Wu Tao’s couple.

Yet, as expected, when they returned to the Nan Gong family, Wu Ping was immediately transferred by Nan Gong family’s servants and medical staff into a room specifically set up for Wu Ping.

Su Nantian had originally intended to follow them to protect Wu Ping, but at this moment, he saw Nan Gong family’s housekeeper smiling and walking toward him.

Su Nantian had met this person before and knew he was Nan Gong Lin’s assistant, standing by his side. Thus, his meaning represented Nan Gong Lin’s intent.
