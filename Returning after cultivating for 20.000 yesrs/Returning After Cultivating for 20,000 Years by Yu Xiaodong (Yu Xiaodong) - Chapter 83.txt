"Regarding your Shadow Assassins Organization, I have already investigated it. I know all about you two brothers' background. You both had a tough childhood, and it's no small feat that you've built such an organization. I definitely recognize your abilities. I also believe the two of you would be ideal assistants for me."

Su Nantian made no effort to hide that he had once sent people to investigate the Shadow Assassins Organization.

When Qi Yinzhen heard Su Nantian's words, his eyes darkened as he recalled his childhood.

He and Qi Yeyu were brothers who had lost their parents at a young age, left to wander the streets until someone took them in and trained them in combat. They were raised as killers.

But both Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yeyu knew they couldn't live like that forever. The dark life of being a killer was unbearable.

Later, during a mission, they fled and went into hiding, meeting like-minded friends who helped them establish their own organization.

Although the Shadow Assassins Organization still performed tasks for others, they now had autonomy and no longer relied on others.

This life was far better than before.

"I don't know if you two dislike your current lifestyle, but if you do, you can follow me. I promise to never let you live like that again. You've seen my entire Tihao Group. If you're willing, you can stay here."

In truth, Su Nantian didn't just want Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yeyu to join Tihao Group. He aimed to expand his private affairs, and this was merely the beginning.

After hearing Su Nantian's words, Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yeyu were deeply moved. People like them longed for stability.

They both knew that following Su Nantian wouldn't guarantee peace, as they'd face challenges constantly. But it was still better than their current life.

Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yeyu exchanged a glance before Wang Tian said to Su Nantian, "We're willing. But please accept our entire Shadow Assassins Organization as well. To us, the brothers in the organization are like family. We must share life and death together."

Su Nantian immediately smiled and said, "What are you thinking? Of course I want your entire organization to join me. I won't ask you to betray anyone. Since you've agreed, from now on we are brothers."

As Su Nantian said this, he stepped forward and extended his hand toward Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yeyu. The three of them overlapped their hands and clasped them tightly.

Qi Yinzhen, Qi Yeyu, and Su Nantian laughed heartily. They suddenly felt they had made the right decision.

Following someone like Su Nantian, they would surely unleash their true strength and value. The Shadow Assassins Organization would also flourish.

"By the way, Su Nantian. What about Master of Medicine's illness? Please save him first."

After finishing the formal discussion, Qi Yinzhen suddenly remembered their other purpose: to have Su Nantian rescue Master of Medicine.

Earlier, during the match between Su Nantian and Master of Medicine, Su Nantian had used just a few silver needles to leave Master of Medicine in his current condition.

"It's nothing serious. I've already prepared everything. It's simple—just not something others can solve without my help. But actually, it's easy to cure."

Su Nantian pulled out a small bag from his pocket.

"Here is a pouch of powder and one pill. Have him take the pill, then mix it equally with water and apply it to his hands. After that, he'll recover fully in a day."

After saying this, Su Nantian handed the bag over.

"Is it really that simple?" Qi Yeyu asked in disbelief, as Master of Medicine had tried to treat himself but failed despite great effort.

Master of Medicine had even declared that his current condition required a long time to heal and bed rest.

"Yes, it's really that simple. Do you want something more complicated?"

Zhang Tian asked in confusion, wondering why anyone would prefer a complex solution.

"No, no, I'm just surprised. I didn't expect this illness to be so quick to cure. Master of Medicine himself said it was complicated."

Qi Yeyu answered honestly.

"You know, Master of Medicine's medical skills are still lacking, but he is a top-tier talent. That must be acknowledged."

After hearing Su Nantian's words, Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yeyu both sighed. They knew Master of Medicine's medical level, so Su Nantian's words clearly proved his skills were far superior.

They also realized Su Nantian wasn't boasting. The match had already proven his medical skills were better than Master of Medicine's, so they believed him without doubt.

Chapter 402: Returning to the Wen Family

After their pleasant conversation, Qi Yinzhen said, "Nantian, do we need to take action against Leng Boxiong? He must hate you now and could still be a threat."

Su Nantian shook his head dismissively, "Leng Boxiong's power has vanished. The entire Tihao Group is mine. His influence is minimal and lacks personal strength. Don't worry, but to be safe, have someone keep an eye on him."

This immediately highlighted Qi Yinzhen's difference. As soon as he became Su Nantian's brother, he started strategizing for him.

"Fine, as you said, I'll have someone watch over him and see what he's up to."

Su Nantian's smooth acquisition of the Shadow Assassins Organization was due to his immense personal power, which made Qi Yinzhen and Qi Yeyu willingly submit.

After handling this matter, Su Nantian knew his task at Tihao Group was complete. The next phase would be Wen Ran's turn to shine.

Wen Ran had just taken office and immediately issued several strict regulations, prompting the management to follow suit. She also balanced power within the leadership, which impressed Su Nantian greatly.

He hadn't expected the delicate girl in his arms to have such talent in business.

At the same time, Su Nantian couldn't help but lament how blind Wen Hai was. He wanted to pass his company to Wen Liang, ignoring his daughter's strong business abilities.

After Wen Ran returned from Tihao Group that day, she and Su Nantian prepared to eat when her phone rang.

Wen Ran saw the name "Wen Hai" on her phone and showed it to Su Nantian.

"I think it's my father. I wonder what he wants."

"Answer the call and see what he needs."

Although Su Nantian said this, he already knew. He had anticipated Wen Hai would call at this time.

"Hello, Dad, what's up?"

Wen Ran asked confusedly after answering.

"You're talking nonsense. I'm your father, and calling you isn't something that requires a reason?"

The voice on the phone said sternly.

"You're so rude, Dad. You don't know how to speak properly?" But on the other end, Wen Ran heard her mother's voice scolding Wen Hai for being too harsh.

"Okay, okay, I'll speak properly." Wen Hai replied and picked up the phone again.

"Wen Ran, come home for dinner tonight."

Wen Hai said this, which surprised Wen Ran. She had just quarreled with her family over Su Nantian and now her father suddenly called to ask her home.

"Oh, by the way, bring Su Nantian with you too. Let's have a family dinner."

Wen Hai continued. This shocked Wen Ran even more. Previously, her father had strongly disliked Su Nantian, but now he asked her to return with him. That was absurd.

Wen Ran looked at Su Nantian with a puzzled expression and said, "Okay, I know. I'll go back later. As for Nantian, whether he wants to come is up to him. I won't force him."

"Fine, that's it. No problem."

After saying this, Wen Hai hung up.

"What's wrong?" Su Nantian sat at the table and looked at Wen Ran.

Her expression had been strange, so he wondered what happened and asked curiously.

"My father asked me to come home for dinner tonight. He said you should come too. Do you want to go?"

Wen Ran had said she wouldn't force him, but if Su Nantian wanted to go, it would be great. If he didn't want to return, she'd go alone. After all, it was her family home, so she definitely had to return.

"Then will you go?" Su Nantian asked.

Wen Ran nodded, so Su Nantian continued, "Since you're going back, I'll go with you. I'm coming with you."

"You're really great," Wen Ran said, then hugged Su Nantian again. He reached out to pat her hair, and they both laughed.

Su Nantian knew exactly why Wen Hai had called Wen Ran back this time. So he would go with her tonight, otherwise Wen Ran might face many things alone.

After deciding to return together, they didn't continue eating. They quickly got ready and changed into their outdoor clothes before Su Nantian drove Wen Ran back to the Wen family.

When Wen Ran rang the doorbell, the housekeeper immediately ran over and opened the door. Seeing Wen Ran, she said, "Miss, you're back! Your father and mother have been waiting for a long time. Master Wen also came to celebrate the reunion."

After hearing this, Wen Ran said nothing but nodded. She and Su Nantian walked in one after another.

When they reached the entrance, they saw a pair of shoes there—probably Wen Liang had arrived.

Wen Ran glanced at Su Nantian and said, "It seems my brother really came."

"Let him come. No need to rush. Change your slippers and go in."

Su Nantian was completely calm, indifferent to who had come or their intentions. He only knew he was with Wen Ran, and that was enough.

When Wen Ran and Su Nantian changed their slippers and entered the living room, they saw Wen Ran's parents and Wen Liang sitting on the sofa, discussing something.

Upon seeing Wen Ran and Su Nantian, they immediately stood up from the sofa and smiled.

"Wen Ran is back! And Nantian, you're here too. That's great."

Wen Hai smiled with wrinkles but still smiled warmly, calling them affectionately.

After seeing this scene, Su Nantian felt a bit nauseous because he had never seen Wen Hai smile like this since meeting him.

But Su Nantian understood why Wen Hai was doing it—he had a need for him.

Chapter 403: The Banquet

"You two shouldn't just stand there. Sit down, the food is ready."

Wen Hai said to Wen Ran and Su Nantian, then eagerly pointed at the empty seats beside them.

Su Nantian didn't hesitate and pulled Wen Ran's hand to sit down, as if their past conflicts had been erased.

The housekeeper brought the food over.

No one said much, and they started eating silently.

Su Nantian intentionally stayed quiet to see how long Wen Hai could hold it in.

Finally, Wen Hai couldn't hold back and suddenly looked up at Su Nantian, "Nantian, did you win your bet with Leng Boxiong?"

Su Nantian knew Wen Hai was asking knowingly. The whole city had already heard the news last night that Leng Boxiong lost his entire Tihao Group to Su Nantian.

Su Nantian didn't say much and nodded, "Yes, Tihao Group is now mine."

"You really have skills," Wen Hai said with a grin, clearly coveting Tihao Group.

Wen Hai had always been suppressed by Leng Boxiong, so now that Leng Boxiong was defeated by Su Nantian, his biggest threat had vanished.

Moreover, Wen Hai's daughter Wen Ran was now in a relationship with Su Nantian. From his perspective, he was essentially Su Nantian's father-in-law and could easily get involved in managing Tihao Group.

Su Nantian saw Wen Hai's flattery but didn't answer immediately. He knew exactly what Wen Hai wanted, that he was coveting Tihao Group and wanted to take a share.

"What about your relationship with my daughter?" Wen Hai's wife, seeing her husband was too direct, took a roundabout way to persuade Su Nantian.

"Ah? We're doing well, our relationship is stable," Su Nantian said.

"What are your plans? For example, when will you marry my daughter?"

Wen Ran's mother continued to ask.

"I think marriage is a bit early, but our relationship has always been good, so whether we marry or not doesn't matter. However, I will definitely give Wen Ran a proper explanation. You can rest assured."

Su Nantian said this and continued eating, as if he didn't know anything.

In reality, the three of Wen Hai's family were trying to use him and Wen Ran's relationship to nibble away at the shares of Tihao Group he had just acquired.

But Wen Ran had already sensed that this dinner was unusual. Everyone seemed to have their own agenda—her father, her mother, and even her brother Wen Liang hadn't acted yet.

Wen Ran frowned and pinched Su Nantian's thigh under the table, then exchanged a glance with him.

Su Nantian smiled and gave her a "trust me" look, then said nothing more.

"I'll just say it straight: you two are too complicated. You always go around the bush, how can he understand? Or maybe he just doesn't want to understand."

Wen Liang finally couldn't hold back and slammed his chopsticks down, then spoke to Su Nantian.

"Oh, what do you mean by that?" Su Nantian asked knowingly.

"Su Nantian, I'm telling you, if you want to be with my sister, it's not impossible. Before, your status wasn't equal, and you didn't deserve her. But now that the Leng family has declined and Tihao Group is yours, you have the qualifications to be with Wu You'er."

Wen Liang spoke without a blush.

"That's great. So your meaning is that I'm now officially with Wen Ran, right?" Su Nantian continued to avoid the topic, deliberately shifting it elsewhere.

Wen Liang was immediately angry; his words were clearly evading and changing the subject.

"My point is, if you want to marry my sister and be with Wen Ran, you must give us some benefits. That's like a dowry. Since Tihao Group is now yours, giving us forty percent of the shares isn't too much, right?"

Wen Liang finally revealed their thoughts.

"Brother, what are you talking about? Tihao Group is Su Nantian's. Why should we get shares from it? You people aren't bullying him?"

Wen Ran, upon hearing this, became anxious and didn't want Su Nantian to think she was money-driven. She had no desire for Tihao Group's shares at all.

If Wen Ran had wanted the shares from the beginning, she could have accepted Su Nantian's offer to transfer them. But she hadn't taken them, only the position of CEO.

This proved Wen Ran had no such intentions. Now, the three of them were discussing this behind her back.

Su Nantian tightly held Wen Ran's hand under the table and patted it to reassure her.

After feeling Su Nantian's comfort, Wen Ran immediately fell silent and sat down without saying anything.

"You can't say it like that. We know Tihao Group is yours now, but if you want to be with my sister and marry her, this share as a dowry isn't too much, right?"

Wen Liang continued, his face shameless but he saw it as natural.

"Forty percent of the shares seems a bit much, doesn't it?"

Unexpectedly, Su Nantian responded this way.

Upon hearing Su Nantian's response, Wen Ran tugged his sleeve and whispered in his ear, "Nantian, don't give them the shares. These shares are yours, why should you give them? Just keep them yourself."

"I know what I'm doing. Don't worry," Su Nantian whispered back in Wen Ran's ear. He naturally wouldn't hand over Tihao Group's shares to others, but he also wanted to show the Wen family that he wasn't easy to mess with.

Even if he was with Wen Ran, he wouldn't give them any benefits.

Chapter 404: Decisive Departure

"Su Nantian, think it through. If you still want to be with my sister, give us some shares of Tihao Group. It's good for you and me, we can all be a happy family."

Wen Liang continued shamelessly without realizing Su Nantian's eyes had turned sharp.

"Yes, we're all family now, no distinction between us. Since Tihao Group is yours, it's also ours, right?"

Wen Hai quickly joined in.

"Wen Hai, did you forget what you said before the match? What did you say then? How could you change your mind so quickly?"

Su Nantian put down his chopsticks and slammed them on the table.

Wen Hai hadn't expected Su Nantian to bring up that night's conversation, but he thought Su Nantian had forgotten.

"I did it for Wen Ran's sake. Who knew what would happen then? Compared to you, Leng Boxiong had a bigger family and more resources. He was definitely the better choice. Also, I heard he spent a lot of money to hire the Shadow Assassins Organization. Compared to you, he was more reliable. So I asked my daughter to leave you—it was necessary."

Wen Hai spoke stubbornly.

"What did you say then? That Wen Ran could return and marry Leng Zhi Fei, becoming a rich lady."

Su Nantian recited the words Wen Hai had said that night.

"I've told you, my woman won't be a rich lady. If she's to be one, she'll be a queen. Now I've let Wen Ran manage Tihao Group entirely. She's the CEO now. But I'll tell you this: not a single share of Tihao Group will be touched by you. This isn't something you should even think about."

Su Nantian stood up to leave, but Wen Liang suddenly mustered courage and grabbed Su Nantian's arm.

"You're just being stubborn, not eating the wine. This time you got lucky with a big gamble that changed your fate and made Tihao Group yours. But how can someone like you run a company well?"

Wen Liang had no trace of his previous timidness. It seemed he'd regained his strength after a few days at home.

Su Nantian smiled and turned to pat Wen Liang's face, "Wen Liang, I think you've regained your strength again, right? Forgetting what happened before?"

Wen Liang's face turned red. Two days ago, he had been caught by Su Nantian and trembled with Leng Zhi Fei. Now he was lively again.

"I've already said, if the Wen family gives me respect, I'll give them respect too. But from start to finish, the Wen family never gave me any respect. So I have no choice but to not give them any either. My relationship with Wen Ran is between us two, and it has nothing to do with you all. I admit you are her closest relatives, but what you've given her is not good memories, only endless pain."

Su Nantian pulled Wen Ran over and continued to speak to them: "I won't give you any shares of Tihao Group, but I'll still treat Wen Ran well. I won't let you hurt her because of this. I hope you don't have any more ideas in the future. Focus on developing your own businesses and don't dig your own grave."

As Su Nantian said this, he and Wen Ran prepared to leave. But when they reached the door, Su Nantian seemed to remember something and turned back to say: "If you don't stay in your place, I can't promise what I'll do. Just see if the Wen family's companies want to survive. Alright, we're leaving."

After saying this, Su Nantian and Wen Ran opened the door and left without giving Wen Hai's parents or Wen Liang any face.

"Did you regret it, Wen Ran?"

Sitting in the car, Su Nantian suddenly asked.

Wen Ran naturally knew what Su Nantian meant. He was asking if it was worth it for her to be with him, causing a rift with her family. Did she regret it?

Many people valued their families more, but now the situation was clear—Su Nantian and the Wen family had no chance of reconciliation. Wen Ran could only stand by Su Nantian's side.

Wen Ran shook her head and said, "I don't regret it. I made my decision from the beginning. I won't regret it, even if this involves my parents and brother. I'll always stand by your side because I believe you're right."

This was the first time Wen Ran had fully revealed her heart. She hadn't said many things to Su Nantian before, but kept them buried in her heart.

"You're great, Wen Ran," Su Nantian smiled and reached out to hold her hand. He felt warm inside, vowing to treat Wen Ran well in the future.

After all, having such a girl who would defy her family for him—if he didn't treat her well, she'd have no home.

As Su Nantian and Wen Ran were driving back when they met halfway, Su Nantian suddenly received a call from Qi Yinzhen.

He knew Qi Yinzhen wouldn't call him without reason, so he immediately answered the phone.

"Su Nantian, something's wrong. We've been monitoring Leng Boxiong's movements and found he seems to have made contact with some people. I don't know what they're doing, but it's definitely related to you. We need more time to investigate, but I think this is something you should know first. Be prepared for anything. Leng Boxiong will definitely seek revenge for Tihao Group."

Qi Yinzhen immediately told Su Nantian everything he had discovered.

"Okay, I understand. You keep monitoring Leng Boxiong. I know he'll do something after losing Tihao Group, but I didn't expect him to act so quickly. It seems this guy still has some depth and isn't completely powerless after losing Tihao Group."

Su Nantian continued to have Qi Yinzhen monitor Leng Boxiong. He was mainly worried about Leng Boxiong targeting Wen Ran.

Now that Wen Ran had become the CEO of Tihao Group, she was definitely a target for Leng Boxiong. Plus, Leng Boxiong's relationship with the Wen family wasn't good. Before, they could maintain a facade of alliance for mutual benefit.

But after the previous events—including Wen Liang abandoning Leng Zhi Fei and the series of incidents with Tihao Group—Leng Boxiong would definitely not show mercy to Wen Ran.

Chapter 405: Accident

After Su Nantian hung up with Qi Yinzhen, he suddenly saw a flash before his eyes. A car seemed to dart out from nowhere, blinding him with its headlights.

But Su Nantian was driving on a one-way street, so there shouldn't be any cars coming from the opposite direction. He immediately realized this car was intentional.

"Damn, he acted so fast," Su Nantian muttered and immediately slowed down, steering the car to the side.

Su Nantian said to Wen Ran, "Don't be afraid, listen to my instructions. Otherwise, it'll get complicated."

Wen Ran wasn't just any girl; she didn't panic at sudden events. Especially since Su Nantian was by her side, she had nothing to fear.

"Okay, I'll do what you say." Wen Ran was still a bit nervous but tightly gripped the seatbelt and door handle to find balance as the car jolted.

"I'll slowly reduce speed, then I'll unlock the door. When I tell you to jump, open the door and jump out immediately, protecting your head."

Su Nantian continued to dodge. He knew the car was definitely after him, and he had to get Wen Ran out safely.

Su Nantian didn't care much about his own safety, knowing that if a car hit him like this, he'd be unharmed. But Wen Ran was an ordinary person, so Su Nantian had to protect her safety.

"What about you? Are you staying in the car?"

Wen Ran asked after hearing Su Nantian's words, concerned about his safety. If she just jumped out, what would happen to Su Nantian?

"Don't worry about me. I'll escape. Once you're safe, I'll be at ease and can focus on escaping this situation."

As Su Nantian spoke, their car suddenly jolted because another car had hit them from behind.

"They're here too! Do what I said!"

Su Nantian knew it was urgent. The cars in front and behind were closing in, clearly aiming to kill him.

At this point, Su Nantian didn't need to think about who it was—Leng Boxiong and Leng Zhi Fei, no doubt. They must have hired killers for money, driving cars to crash into him.

"Maybe you'll be disappointed. This trick isn't dangerous for me at all."

Su Nantian suddenly turned the wheel, sending the car to the right. At this moment, there was a green belt on the right side, so Wen Ran would get some cushion if she jumped.

Su Nantian slowly reduced the car's speed, and Wen Ran knew the critical moment was coming.

Wen Ran immediately unfastened her seatbelt.

Su Nantian, while driving, kept an eye on Wen Ran's every move. He had to watch both the front and back cars' attacks while also adjusting his actions based on Wen Ran's movements.

Su Nantian slowed the car and suddenly unlocked the door, saying to Wen Ran, "Now! Jump quickly without hesitation!"

Wen Ran immediately opened the door and jumped out with her hands covering her head, landing in the green belt.

After seeing Wen Ran safely land, Su Nantian stepped on the accelerator and drove at full speed.

Su Nantian didn't want to clash with these two in a high-speed chase. He opened his car door and climbed onto the roof.

The people in the following car clearly noticed Su Nantian was no longer in the driver's seat and rammed his car again, trying to knock him off.

But Su Nantian wouldn't let them succeed. When the following car hit his car, he jumped and landed on the roof of the other car, then kicked the driver's window.

Su Nantian knocked out the person inside and turned the steering wheel, then jumped down from the car.

When Su Nantian landed safely on the green belt, he saw the car crash into a power pole on the left. The front of the car was completely destroyed, and the airbags had all deployed.

The car coming from the front also couldn't avoid it, colliding with this car.

"Bad driving skills. It's really not challenging."

Su Nantian clapped his hands and said.

But he suddenly thought about Wen Ran jumping out of the car. Although she had landed safely, she must have been slightly injured. He immediately ran back to check on her condition.

However, when Su Nantian reached the green belt behind, he only saw a noticeable pit where Wen Ran had landed. He couldn't find her anywhere.

Nearby, there was a shoe and a bag belonging to Wen Ran scattered on the ground.

Su Nantian immediately looked around but saw a car speeding away in the distance.

"Damn it!" Su Nantian cursed and kicked the telephone pole several times, causing it to bend.

Su Nantian hadn't expected that he had overlooked this—just a short time, Wen Ran was taken.

"Wait for me, Leng Boxiong! I'll make you pay!"

Su Nantian shouted on the road. He knew it was definitely Leng Boxiong and his son's doing. They must have used Wen Ran as a hostage to force him to return Tihao Group's shares.

For Su Nantian, his soft spot in Hangcheng was indeed Wen Ran. Also Wu You'er.

Thinking of Wu You'er, Su Nantian suddenly felt anxious—had Leng Boxiong taken both Wen Ran and Wu You'er?

Su Nantian immediately took out his phone. The phone's quality was really good, surviving the collision intact.

He immediately called Wu You'er to confirm his safety.

But no matter how Su Nantian dialed, the phone was disconnected.

Su Nantian immediately understood—Leng Boxiong had used all his tricks to kidnap both Wen Ran and Wu You'er.

Chapter 406: Investigation

To be safe, Su Nantian didn't immediately go after Leng Boxiong. He first returned home and asked Zhang Bao to check Wu You'er's school to see if he was there.

After returning home, Su Nantian found Wu You'er wasn't there and received Zhang Bao's message. After going to Wu You'er's school, Zhang Bao asked many classmates who said they hadn't seen Wu You'er today.

At this point, Su Nantian was certain—Wen Ran wasn't just kidnapped by Leng Boxiong, but Wu You'er was also taken.

"Leng Boxiong acted quickly. Qi Yinzhen just told me about some news, and he immediately executed it."

Su Nantian hadn't expected Leng Boxiong to be so impatient, acting immediately after contacting someone.

Now Su Nantian's top priority was to find Leng Boxiong and his son's hideout. Once he knew where they were, he could immediately find Wen Ran and Wu You'er and rescue them.
