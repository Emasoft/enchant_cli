Wang Shu felt his heart clench painfully at these thoughts, for he had caused the deaths of so many innocent villagers in Xiaoyu Village. Even if he were to repay this debt across lifetimes, it would still be insufficient.

"South Heaven, you must protect Xiaowang at all costs... absolutely ensure his safety..."

Wang Shu knew now was not the time for regret. He turned to Su Nantian, his body weakened to the brink of death, yet his eyes remained black and luminous, fixed on Su Nantian.

"Wang Shu, rest assured I will protect Xiaowang. You must hold on— I will save you too, I promise."

When Wang Shu spoke these words, Su Nantian quickly reassured him, unwilling to let despair consume him.

"Wang Shu, they won't blame you. Don’t dwell on it."

Su Nantian repeated these words, watching Wang Shu with concern, fearing he would spiral into despair.

Wang Shu shook his head weakly, offering a faint smile: "I am an old man who has lived long enough. It's fine— just promise me you'll protect Xiaowang, absolutely ensure his safety. Do not let him fall into the hands of those with ill intent."

Wang Shu repeated this sentence over and over, urging Su Nantian to watch over Xiaowang vigilantly.

"South Heaven, I know you are a boy of your word. You must care for Xiaowang. If he is taken by them, the consequences would be catastrophic. More innocent lives will be lost. So you must protect him!"

Wang Shu spoke with urgency, his words filled with solemnity. He repeated this same plea again and again, emphasizing that Su Nantian must safeguard Xiaowang— as if Xiaowang's identity concealed a great mystery.

"South Heaven?"

Though Su Nantian understood Wang Shu's deep concern for Xiaowang, hearing his repeated warnings stirred a quiet doubt in him.

"Don’t interrupt me— let me speak."

Wang Shu coughed painfully, then urged Su Nantian: "South Heaven, remember— beneath the pillow in our home lies a box containing proof of Xiaowang’s identity. Keep it safe, and give it to him when he grows older. Tell him the truth."

Wang Shu realized his time was limited, so he hurriedly revealed all he knew to Su Nantian. He repeated his instructions again and again, begging him to protect Xiaowang at all costs.

He grasped Su Nantian’s hand tightly, placing his hopes entirely in him: "Remember— take Xiaowang away. Take him with you."

Seeing Wang Shu’s deteriorating condition, Su Nantian nodded immediately.

Chapter 899: Farewell to Uncle Wang

"Promise me— promise me!"

After seeing Su Nantian nod, Wang Shu added urgently.

"I understand, Uncle Wang."

Su Nantian could not refuse Wang Shu’s request. He swallowed his sorrow and answered solemnly: "Yes, I promise you, Uncle Wang..."

He had intended to urge Wang Shu to take care of himself, but before he could finish, Wang Shu’s face turned ashen, as if the last traces of life were slipping from him.

"Take care of... Xiaowang..."

Wang Shu whispered weakly, his final words revealing the one person he cherished most. After struggling to utter this, Wang Shu slowly closed his eyes, and his breath ceased.

Even his hand, which had clutched Su Nantian’s, loosened and fell lifelessly to the ground.

*Clap...*

Wang Shu’s hand fell with a soft sound, lightly striking the earth. Though the noise was faint and barely audible, Su Nantian heard it clearly.

This sound seemed to explode in his ears and strike his heart, leaving Su Nantian momentarily breathless.

"Uncle Wang! Uncle Wang!"

Su Nantian remained silent for a moment, unable to accept the reality before him. This gentle, rarely stubborn elder— this man who had saved him from the river— was gone...

Su Nantian’s fists clenched tightly, his body trembling for the first time not from fear but from the unbearable weight of this truth.

"Uncle Wang!"

Su Nantian widened his eyes, holding his breath as he cried out Uncle Wang’s name. But Uncle Wang was already dead— there would be no response.

At that moment, Chen Xiaoling and the others ran back, panting heavily. Though they were also worried about the situation in Xiaoyu Village, they were merely ordinary people— unlike Su Nantian. They had exhausted every ounce of their strength to flee from the mountain where they had been gathering herbs.

Yet, the sight before them left all three of them stunned. Especially when they saw the familiar villagers lying lifeless in pools of blood, their faces etched with terror.

"No! This isn’t real!"

Chen Xiaoling took a step back, covering her ears with her hands, refusing to accept the truth.

"Village Chief! Ah Heng?"
"Lao Li? Lao Zheng? Er Huizi?"

Chen Xiaoling and the young man called out repeatedly, their voices trembling. Usually, these greetings would be met with warm responses or smiles— but now, there was nothing.

The villagers lay dead in their own blood, their bodies already stiff and cold. The laughter and joy that had once filled the air now echoed only as the drip of blood from their wounds.

The villagers could no longer respond to them. No matter how desperately they shouted, the villagers would never return.

"This can’t be real! It’s a dream, right? What in the world is happening?"

Each of them could not accept this horrifying scene. Chen Xiaoling stood frozen, speechless and motionless.

They had no idea that their simple routine— gathering herbs on the mountain— would lead to this. They never imagined that those lying in blood were their familiar neighbors, uncles, and friends.

How could they accept such a cruel reality?

"South Heaven, what happened?"

Chen Xiaoling rushed to Su Nantian’s side, urgently asking. Now she realized that except for the few of them, everyone else in Xiaoyu Village had been brutally murdered!

"Rascals! What are you? You don’t hear me speaking, do you?"

Before Su Nantian could answer, the black-cloaked men frowned in annoyance. They had been stunned by Su Nantian’s sudden appearance, unsure where he had come from.

Even more infuriating was that Su Nantian ignored their warnings and threats, treating them as if they were invisible.

When had these black-cloaked men ever been so disregarded?

Their faces darkened, and they began to question Su Nantian angrily.

But before they could fire at Su Nantian, their bullets failed to penetrate an invisible barrier. The air seemed to solidify, and the bullets could not reach Su Nantian’s side.

"Is it you?"

After hearing their shouts, Su Nantian clenched his fists again. His bones cracked with fury, and his knuckles turned white. His temples throbbed violently in rhythm with the anger coursing through him.

"Did you kill Uncle Wang and the others?"

Su Nantian gritted his teeth, speaking through clenched jaws. He slowly rose to his feet, carefully placing Uncle Wang’s body down before gazing deeply into his eyes. When he looked up again, his gaze was filled with unrelenting fury.

If animals sense disasters before they strike, Su Nantian’s expression now was the prelude to a storm.

There would be no mercy for these people!

"Indeed, it was you who killed them! You scum!"

Chen Xiaoling also clenched her fists, echoing Su Nantian’s words. She glared at the black-cloaked men, wishing to tear their flesh apart.

"Who else but us?"

The leader of the black-cloaked men, unaware of Su Nantian’s strength, thought they were merely making their final cries. He answered smugly.

His eyes held arrogance, as if he had already won.

"What does it matter? Can you even harm us?"

The black-cloaked men sneered, their gazes growing more contemptuous.

"Uncle! Uncle! Please save me! I’m so scared, Uncle!"

Xiaowang struggled violently, kicking and pushing at the men who held him. He called out to Su Nantian for help, desperate to escape their grasp.

Chapter 900: Dangerous Figure

"Xiaowang, be quiet and stay still. I’ll come save you."

Su Nantian’s face was cold, his eyes filled with fury. But when he heard Xiaowang’s cries, he quickly softened, becoming gentle in an instant.

Though Su Nantian had learned from Uncle Wang that these people were after Xiaowang with such force, he knew they would not kill him.

Yet these people were clearly no ordinary individuals— even if they did not harm Xiaowang, Su Nantian feared that if Xiaowang provoked them, he would suffer.

After thinking this through, Su Nantian spoke softly to Xiaowang: "Xiaowang, be good. Listen to your uncle. I’ll deal with them first and then come save you."

Su Nantian had promised Uncle Wang he would protect Xiaowang. And over these days, Su Nantian felt Xiaowang’s genuine trust in him— he had already regarded Xiaowang as family.

After calming Xiaowang, Su Nantian’s expression returned to its cold demeanor. A closer look revealed his eyes filled with unrelenting hatred.

He would personally kill these people to avenge the villagers of Xiaoyu Village!

Absolutely.

"What in the world is happening?"

Chen Xiaoling and the others still could not accept this reality, whispering in disbelief. Their faces were pale with fear. But Su Nantian had no time or patience to comfort them now— the priority was to deal with these people and rescue Xiaowang. He would make those who had killed the villagers pay a heavy price.

"Brat, you’ve got guts! You dare to say you’ll deal with us?"

The leader of the black-cloaked men, hearing Su Nantian’s words, thought it was a joke. He raised an eyebrow and looked at Su Nantian with disdain: "Brothers! Give him a taste of our power and let him know that heroes aren’t so easy to be!"

The leader’s words were met with loud agreement from the others. They had always disliked Su Nantian for his arrogance and now, upon hearing their leader’s command, they immediately aimed their guns at Su Nantian.

But just as before, the familiar scene returned— all bullets were blocked by an invisible barrier and fell to the ground.

"Hey, boss! What’s going on? Our bullets aren’t working?"

"What? My bullets are fine!"

The men began to chatter, exchanging confused glances.

They had no problems when they killed the villagers of Xiaoyu Village earlier— so why now did their bullets fail against Su Nantian?

Some of them refused to believe it and fired again. But the result was the same— all bullets were blocked by that strange barrier, falling to the ground halfway.

"Hmph! Stay calm! This is just a minor trick— don’t be alarmed!"

The leader sneered and reassured his men. He then looked at Su Nantian with contempt: "You don’t need to act so mysterious here. I know what technique you’re using!"

At this point, the leader suddenly spoke a sentence that left Su Nantian completely confused.

"It seems we underestimated you. Are you also a cultivator? That’s why you’re so arrogant when facing us!"

Not only was he arrogant, but it was outright arrogance— as if they didn’t exist at all.

"Cultivator?"

Su Nantian furrowed his brows, completely unaware of what the leader meant.

It was the first time he had heard this unfamiliar term— or perhaps it wasn’t so unfamiliar. It felt familiar, as if it had existed in his memory before.

When he heard the word "cultivator," Su Nantian felt a subtle stir in his heart, as if it resonated with something deep within him.

"Cultivator."

Su Nantian unconsciously said the word, and his heartbeats quickened. It felt as if it had truly resonated with him. His mind suddenly flashed with familiar fragments— many memories, but now they were too chaotic and he could not sort them out.

So Su Nantian forced himself to push these thoughts aside for now, focusing instead on dealing with the current trouble.

"Hmph! Don’t act like you don’t know what I’m talking about. You’ve used this technique before, and we all know it! We’re the same people— why hide?"

At this point, the leader sneered again. He seemed to be calculating how to deal with Su Nantian and then his eyes darkened— he had already decided on a plan.

"Good enough! Stop using guns. This brat is a cultivator— ordinary means won’t work against him. It’s time we showed our true strength."

"Yes, boss!"

The other black-cloaked men all held their breath and immediately responded in unison. They stared at Su Nantian with murderous intent.

If it were an ordinary person with a thin skin, they would have already been defeated by these stares. But what was Su Nantian?

He wouldn’t be intimidated by these people at all.

Su Nantian’s heart had not even a single tremor— he did not show the fear or begging expressions that these people had expected.

"Damn it! Everyone, bring out your real skills! One move and this arrogant brat will be finished!"

The leader shouted again, his eyes filled with growing hostility.

Hearing the leader’s command, they followed it— throwing away their guns and forming a neat line.

Next, they performed some hand gestures in front of their chests, shouting together and pushing their palms forward.

Though they had done nothing, after this action, the air around them seemed to ripple— and suddenly, a whirlwind of sand and stones was formed.

It rushed toward Su Nantian’s direction with great force, moving violently and strangely.

Chapter 901: Cultivator

"Go!"

The leader shouted again, pointing at Su Nantian. A strange air current formed and rushed toward him with great force. The closer it got, the stronger its power became— the sand and stones moved faster and faster. If touched, they would be swept in immediately.

Su Nantian furrowed his brows, confusion growing within him.

What was a cultivator? Why did these people sound so familiar with this term? But now wasn’t the time to ponder— his priority was to kill them and avenge Uncle Wang and the villagers of Xiaoyu.

After thinking this through, Su Nantian took a deep breath and pushed down his thoughts. He then mimicked the previous method— raising his hand and pushing forward.

This was a technique he had used many times before, which allowed him to condense the surrounding air into an invisible protective barrier.

And since he discovered this technique, it had never failed— each time was successful.

This time would be no different.

As Su Nantian’s action took place, the wind attack from the black-cloaked men was completely blocked.

Su Nantian’s demeanor was calm and effortless, as if he had merely lifted his fingers slightly without any effort.

"How is this possible?"

The leader of the black-cloaked men, seeing this scene, immediately furrowed his brows.

But he did not give up immediately— instead, he ordered his men to continue moving their fingers. This time, the movements were longer and more complex— they also chanted something under their breath.

This action was clearly a ritual, as if they were gathering power before unleashing a major attack.

"Hmph! This time, you’ll be finished!"

The leader sneered again and stared at Su Nantian with a sinister gaze. He believed his plan was foolproof, that this major attack would hit Su Nantian.

But what happened? They failed!

Su Nantian was no fool— seeing their major attack, he immediately pushed forward first. He blocked their attack again with solid force.

The collision of their condensed power produced a loud sound, and immediately sand and stones were scattered everywhere.

The black-cloaked men were injured by Su Nantian’s fierce palm technique and took a few steps back, coughing up blood.

No matter how many ultimate techniques they used, they could not move Su Nantian— or rather, they could not break through the invisible air barrier he had formed.

"How is this possible?"

The leader, who had previously been so arrogant and considered Su Nantian a helpless fool, now realized that Su Nantian’s power far exceeded his expectations.

Moreover, from the strength of this move alone, the leader felt uneasy— a rare tension appeared on his face.

Su Nantian’s appearance was beyond their expectations, and his power far exceeded what they had imagined.

"What level of cultivation do you have?"

They furrowed their brows, looking at Su Nantian with confusion.

"Can you really fight evenly against us?"

They were all from a sect and had been sent by their master. Their cultivation levels were quite high— in reality, they had never encountered such power before.

Unexpectedly, they met a man who was also a cultivator— but his strength far exceeded their imagination.

After thinking this through, the leader finally showed a cautious expression.

At that moment, he reminded his men: "Everyone stay alert— this person’s cultivation level is high. Be careful!"

"Yes, boss!"

The other black-cloaked men also responded seriously and watched Su Nantian with caution.

They had carried out this mission for so long, but it was the first time they encountered such a thorny opponent.

"Cultivation? I don’t know what you’re talking about."

Su Nantian furrowed his brows and coldly answered. Then he added: "But are you sure I’ve only fought evenly with you? I merely blocked your attack— and you seem to have used all your strength."

Su Nantian’s tone was cold, as if stating a simple truth.

But Su Nantian did not overestimate himself— he had not used his full strength, nor even a tenth of it.

Moreover, although Su Nantian did not know what the term "cultivation" meant to them, in a place like Xiaoyu Village with abundant spiritual energy, it was only beneficial for him.

At this moment, Su Nantian felt a continuous flow of spiritual energy entering his body, giving him more strength.

"Damn it! Even at the end, you’re still so arrogant!"

The leader had never encountered such a stubborn opponent before. His face turned dark, and those behind him also gritted their teeth, clenching their fists— they longed to teach Su Nantian a lesson.

"End of the line for you!"

Su Nantian coldly spoke, his face turning icy and pale like a thick layer of frost.

"I give you one last chance— release the child, or I will show no mercy!"

At this moment, Su Nantian was completely enraged. He had never imagined these people would commit such cruel acts— and he could not accept that they had attacked the villagers of Xiaoyu.

Su Nantian would never let them go.

This statement was not an act of forgiveness but a chance for them to surrender— if they were wise enough now, Su Nantian would let them die painlessly and keep their bodies intact.

Otherwise, Su Nantian would show them the painful consequences of offending him.

"Let go of him— my patience is limited."

Su Nantian clenched his fists, squeezing out these words through his teeth— a warning and threat to them.

If they did not act wisely, Su Nantian would not hesitate to teach them a lesson— but they would pay with their lives.

"Good, good! You insolent bastard, even now you dare to argue with me? I’ll see if your mouth is tougher or your life!"

The leader had never been defeated before. Now, he had tripped over Su Nantian multiple times— and even in front of his subordinates, he had been mocked by Su Nantian. This made him even more furious.

Chapter 902: Dueling Techniques

At this moment, the leader shouted and ordered his men to use their best techniques— they could not allow Su Nantian to live. In this situation, it was either Su Nantian who died or they.

Therefore, they had to deal with Su Nantian quickly— no one could be a threat to them.

"Listen carefully, everyone! Kill this man and let him know our strength."

At that moment, the leader was unaware of who he had provoked— it wasn’t just an ordinary person. He had encountered someone far more terrifying than the Lord of Hell.

When they did this, the only door left for them was the gate of hell.

And facing Su Nantian, they had dared to be so arrogant— it was truly laughable.

"Hmph! Killing me? That depends on your abilities."

At this moment, Su Nantian heard them discussing how to deal with him. He did not back down but sneered, his gaze growing colder and more resolute.

He would make them pay the price they deserved and let them know the consequences of harming the villagers of Xiaoyu.

Killing him?

He would let them offer sacrifices today and pay a painful price.

"South Heaven, be careful! They are many— you must stay alert!"

At this moment, Chen Xiaoling and the others regained their senses. Hearing Su Nantian’s conversation with the leader, they wore expressions of concern. They knew that Su Nantian and these people were about to engage in a life-or-death battle.

If he was careless, Su Nantian might be injured.

They also worriedly reminded Su Nantian of his safety.

Chen Xiaoling and the young man also watched Su Nantian with concern— their worries were conveyed through their eyes.

Seeing their expressions and kind words, Su Nantian’s demeanor slightly softened, and he gave them a gentle smile.

"Don’t worry— I’m fine. These people can’t harm me."

Su Nantian reassured them with a few words, his face showing a more relaxed expression.

Fortunately, Xiaoyu Village had not been completely destroyed— they were the remaining few. Therefore, these people would become Su Nantian’s next protectees— he would never let them suffer any more harm.

At this moment, Chen Xiaoling and the others were worried about Su Nantian’s safety. They did not know that at this moment, Su Nantian had made a vow— he would protect them and regard them as his responsibility.

"Step back, go to a safe place."

Su Nantian reminded them again, telling them to move aside for their safety.

Hearing Su Nantian’s words, they nodded immediately. They knew their abilities were inferior to Su Nantian’s— and these people had ill intentions. If they rushed forward, it would only add trouble for Su Nantian.

"Good, South Heaven— be careful!"

Hearing this, they nodded and moved to the side. They also reminded Su Nantian with a few words.

Su Nantian nodded, signaling them to move away. Then he coldly stared at these black-cloaked people who radiated an ominous aura.

Their battle was about to begin.

To demonstrate their abilities and intimidate Su Nantian, these black-cloaked people moved with great intensity. They showed no signs of retreat.

They had all prepared to kill Su Nantian and would not give him any chance to fight back.

They formed a neat line, their hands moving quickly— as if they were forming seals. Their movements looked like complex techniques.

They had clearly worked together many times before— their actions were perfectly coordinated and focused entirely on killing Su Nantian.

Even though it was daytime, because of their hand movements and actions, they suddenly summoned a mass of clouds. The sun was quickly obscured by these dark clouds.

The clouds grew denser and darker, pressing heavily over Su Nantian’s group.

"Whew— heaven!"

Seeing this scene, Chen Xiaoling and the others gasped in shock. Their faces turned pale with fear— their concern for Su Nantian deepened. They did not know if Su Nantian had a chance against such an opponent.

"How terrifying these people are!"

The young man spoke in admiration, his gaze now filled with more caution.

"South Heaven will surely deal with them!"

Chen Xiaoling, who had been uneasy before, now loudly refuted the young man’s words. She would not allow him to say such things about Su Nantian.

"South Heaven will surely deal with them!"

Chen Xiaoling repeated this sentence again, now more determined. Though in reality, she was already very anxious and uneasy.

Although Su Nantian had previously shown his extraordinary abilities when fighting with Long Ge, completely overpowering them— and even more so when he had easily defeated those who used firearms— these people were different.

Chen Xiaoling and the others had learned from their conversation that these people were not ordinary— they had even mentioned the term "cultivator."

Especially after seeing them demonstrate their power by changing the weather, Chen Xiaoling and the others felt even more concern.

How could Su Nantian possibly have a chance against such an opponent?

The more she thought about it, the more anxious and uneasy Chen Xiaoling became.

"South Heaven, you should not bother with us— run away quickly! With your abilities, you can escape alone! Run quickly! After all, you are not from Xiaoyu Village. This disaster doesn’t need to be your burden!"

Chapter 903: Lightning Attack

"South Heaven! Run quickly! Don’t bother with us!"

At this moment, Chen Xiaoling changed her mind. Instead of reminding Su Nantian to be careful, she hurriedly urged him to leave.

After all, they were just a burden— they could not help Su Nantian at all. If it weren’t for their concern, Su Nantian could have simply left without taking on this danger.

After hearing these words, Chen Xiaoling and the young man also nodded in agreement: "Yes! South Heaven, run quickly! Don’t bother with us."

They felt they were a burden and could not help Su Nantian in any way. At this moment, they did not want Su Nantian to stay and fall with them.

So they urged him to leave— one by one, if possible.

"What are you saying? I’ve called you South Heaven, so I must protect you."

When Su Nantian heard their words, he felt both amused and helpless. But his heart was inevitably warmed— it felt warm.

He had finally understood the power of language— even a few simple words could make someone feel at ease.

It seemed that no matter how uneasy one was, it could be instantly soothed.

Su Nantian had not yet seen the full extent of their abilities, but after seeing them summon clouds and storms, he felt some unease.

He also worried whether he could counter their techniques— but now that he had heard these words, Su Nantian made a silent vow. No matter if he could counter them or not, even if it meant dying together with them, he would protect Chen Xiaoling and the others.

Thinking of possibly dying alongside these people, Su Nantian quickly reminded them: "Chen Xiaoling, I mean— if something happens to me, and you can take Xiaowang away, then do so."

He continued: "Uncle Wang entrusted Xiaowang to me. If I die, then Xiaowang will be entrusted to you."

At this moment, Su Nantian spoke seriously, his words and expression filled with determination.

The more he said this, the more uneasy it made them.

"No, South Heaven— this was Uncle Wang’s request. It should be you who takes responsibility."

When Chen Xiaoling and the others heard this, they were extremely anxious. It sounded like a dying person’s last words— their hearts were filled with tension and they did not want to take on this hot potato.

"South Heaven, since you promised Uncle Wang, it should be you who takes responsibility. We won’t do anything and won’t take care of Xiaowang!"

Chen Xiaoling echoed her brother’s words, shaking her head at Su Nantian. She was trying to dissuade him from this mindset of death.

"Yes! South Heaven! You know how attached Xiaowang is to you— only you can take care of him. We can’t!"

The young man now understood why Chen Xiaoling and her brother said this, so he quickly added, trying to dissuade Su Nantian.

"Hmph! You foolish people!"

At this moment, the leader and his men sneered again. They watched Su Nantian with contempt: "You really are arrogant— do you think it’s like buying vegetables? You say who leaves, and they leave?"

They had already prepared their ultimate techniques. Su Nantian was wasting time chatting with Chen Xiaoling and the others, discussing these matters— clearly not taking them seriously.

After thinking this through, the leader had dispelled his initial fear of Su Nantian. They now seemed to believe that Su Nantian was not as powerful as he had imagined.

Perhaps it was this brat’s talent for using words to manipulate people, scaring them and making them think he was truly powerful.

After thinking this through, the leader and his men no longer looked at Su Nantian with such fear.
