“ I don’t have time to waste on you. ”

At this moment, Su Nantian coldly spoke. If he had even a little time or mood, he wouldn’t mind playing with them, but Su Nantian was already fed up. He just wanted to figure out what his identity truly was.

Moreover, Su Nantian desperately wanted to understand this Hongye and the Xu family—what connection did they have? Why had they come looking for him?

The next moment, Su Nantian leapt forward and seized Hongye’s throat.

When the others saw Su Nantian's action, they immediately opened fire—but it was as if a barrier had blocked them; no one could harm Su Nantian.

“You… you…”

Hongye hadn’t expected this, and Su Nantian’s attack was so fierce it was faster than a cheetah!

Moreover, Su Nantian’s hand had already tightly gripped his neck. Though he hadn’t yet applied force, Hongye felt a chill run through him.

This single move made him realize he was no match for Su Nantian; if the latter so much as moved a finger, his neck would snap.

“Hey! What are you doing? Let Hongye go! We warn you to let him go!”

Bai Assistant, seeing Hongye in Su Nantian’s grip, immediately became anxious and threatened Su Nantian.

Their weapons had been blocked by Su Nantian, but they still didn’t believe in their luck. They thought with so many people and guns, Su Nantian was alone and had no weapons—surely he couldn’t defeat them.

Even though Hongye was in Su Nantian’s grip, they weren’t without hope; after all, Su Nantian had no weapons on him.

Even if he wanted to kill Hongye, it would take some time. The speed of his fingers was nothing compared to the speed of bullets—there was no point in comparing them.

After thinking this through, Bai Assistant regained his confidence and ordered his subordinates to rescue Hongye immediately; otherwise, if Hongye died, their morale would collapse.

“Everyone, stay alert! Lord Hongye is waiting for our rescue! We can’t give up so easily!”

Bai Assistant shouted, encouraging them. This was also meant for Su Nantian—to let him know that resisting was futile and cooperation was the only way.

“Yes, Assistant Bai!”

The subordinates had been very anxious but, upon hearing Bai Assistant’s words, regained their composure.

Chapter 859: The Xu Family

“Su Nantian!”

They didn’t hesitate; they immediately drew their weapons and aimed at Su Nantian. “Quickly release Lord Hongye! We’ll let you live!”

“You’re too noisy.”

Su Nantian showed no fear or hesitation, only frowning and saying this with annoyance.

His expression was clearly impatient as he spoke.

They didn’t yet understand Su Nantian’s meaning, but the next moment they felt their air thicken and their breathing become difficult. All the oxygen seemed to be stolen from them.

“What…?”

Bai Assistant noticed his body’s change and desperately clutched his neck, opening his mouth wide like a fish out of water, trying to breathe.

The other subordinates were no better; each struggled to open their mouths, desperately trying to draw in a single breath of air.

They were all terrified by this sudden turn of events and could do nothing but stare in panic, their faces varying with fear.

This was a technique Su Nantian had suddenly领悟 in the small fishing village; he didn’t know how, but he discovered he could control the element of wind.

Moreover, he found he could gather air and absorb it entirely—this way, he could make them all suffocate and stop interfering with him.

This method was also scalable, saving much energy.

“Now no one can bother us.”

After dealing with them, Su Nantian turned his gaze back to Hongye.

Hongye was terrified, his face filled with fear. He didn’t know how bold he had been to provoke Su Nantian, a person so formidable.

What unsettled Hongye even more was the killing intent radiating from Su Nantian—he could clearly feel it, and he knew Su Nantian was not playing around.

Moreover, Hongye had accumulated much blood on his hands throughout his rise to power; he understood that one who hadn’t seen blood couldn’t possess Su Nantian’s aura. The more he thought about it, the more afraid he became of Su Nantian.

“What… what do you want?”

Hongye struggled to move his lips, barely managing to say this. He stared at Su Nantian with fear, his pupils constricting; he had no idea how to deal with Su Nantian.

“Simple—ask me, answer me. You’d better give me truthful answers; if I’m satisfied, I might spare your life.”

Su Nantian continued to threaten. This time he spoke clearly; if Hongye cooperated, he wouldn’t mind letting him live. But if Hongye insisted on being uncooperative and tried to play tricks at this moment, Su Nantian would not be merciful.

He didn’t wait for Hongye’s reply and immediately pressed on, because Su Nantian knew Hongye was a smart man who wouldn’t refuse his conditions.

“Don’t you recognize me?”

He asked gradually, focusing on the questions he cared about.

When Hongye heard this question from Su Nantian, he shook his head: “I don’t know you. We’ve never met before.”

As he answered, he was thinking—there was something strange about Su Nantian, but he couldn’t quite put his finger on it.

“Good, cooperate with me like this.”

Su Nantian nodded in satisfaction and continued: “Since you don’t know me, why did you send people to find me in the small fishing village?”

This made no sense. If they were after revenge, Su Nantian might have thought it possible, but since he didn’t know them at all, why would they waste so much effort to find him?

“I was just following orders. He told me to find you, so I did.”

Hongye quickly thought through the situation. After considering it, he had no choice but to shift all blame onto the Xu family.

After all, this was a feud between the Xu family and Su Nantian; he was just trying to get in on the action.

As for now, knowing Su Nantian’s abilities, he dared not hope anymore; to save his life, he would no longer play along.

Even if there were benefits to be gained, what good was it without a life? Hongye didn’t want to lose his life so easily.

“Is it the Xu family! The Xu family is also in M City!”

After thinking this through, Hongye immediately threw the Xu family into the mix without hesitation or feeling his actions were wrong.

“The Xu family?”

This was the second time Su Nantian had heard of the Xu family.

Hongye had mentioned it unintentionally earlier.

“What are they? Why did they come looking for me?”

Hongye first explained the Xu family’s status and background to Su Nantian, then said: “I was just following orders. They told me to find you, so I did. But as for the reasons… they never told me.”

Hongye left a subtle trick here; he was afraid that if he revealed everything, Su Nantian would kill him. So he pretended not to know anything and made himself seem like a pawn of the Xu family.

“That’s something only the head of the Xu family knows.”

After saying this, Hongye quickly begged: “I’ve told you everything I know. Can you keep your promise and let me go?”

Hongye continued to Su Nantian: “If you take me with you, I can also help you. Look, these are my subordinates; I have weapons too. The Xu family is powerful—they’re very strong. If you go alone, you might run into trouble.”

“No need. I’m used to working alone.”

Su Nantian smiled and refused directly. Though he didn’t know why Hongye was so friendly, he knew there was no such thing as a free lunch.

Su Nantian clearly understood this, and he also knew Hongye was saying this to save his life.

“But…”

Hongye was stunned, not expecting Su Nantian to be so bold. But considering Su Nantian’s abilities, he knew why the latter could say this.

Chapter 860: Qiyā

After all, he was telling the truth; he could indeed go alone and deal with the Xu family. But Hongye knew this was one thing, and doing it was another.

Hongye had to make Su Nantian realize his usefulness to save his life; he knew how to deal with these people.

“Alright, you don’t need to talk anymore. I won’t kill you for now.”

Su Nantian smiled, having already seen through Hongye’s plan and inner thoughts: “But if you keep talking nonsense, I might change my mind.”

In other words, Su Nantian was reminding Hongye to be quiet and not say anything inappropriate.

When Hongye heard Su Nantian say this, he wasn’t happy at all because he noticed Su Nantian said “for now,” not “I won’t kill you.” So Hongye’s heart jumped again, and he became anxious.

“Take me to the Xu family; if this really has nothing to do with you, I’ll let you go.”

Su Nantian wasn’t a fool; he wouldn’t allow them to play with him. So Su Nantian had already planned to take Hongye along—not only to get directions but also to verify if what Hongye said was true.

But if Hongye lied, the anger he would face would be unbearable.

After thinking this through, Su Nantian’s expression became even more enigmatic.

Hongye’s heart jumped again; he was already regretting and feeling remorseful, wondering why he had been so clever before. He would have been better off just telling everything outright.

But it was too late for regrets; if he spoke now, Su Nantian would kill him immediately. After thinking it through, Hongye could only follow Su Nantian to the Xu family and look for a chance to save his life.

As Hongye was taken by Su Nantian, someone suddenly rushed in from outside.

Hongye was momentarily stunned; upon seeing the young man’s appearance, he immediately became excited and his face showed a glimmer of hope: “Qiyā!”

Hongye was excited to see Qiyā, who had been sent out on a mission. He must have heard the reports from others and rushed back, but he hadn’t expected to arrive so timely.

When Hongye saw Qiyā, his unease gradually subsided; he thought Qiyā had superhuman strength. Even if Su Nantian was different from ordinary people, he wouldn’t be Qiyā’s match.

Or perhaps Qiyā could delay for a while, allowing him to escape and not be held back by Su Nantian.

After thinking this through, Hongye no longer had the servile attitude he had before; instead, he felt a sense of triumph and confidence. He seemed to believe Su Nantian might not be able to beat Qiyā, and he could escape.

So Hongye no longer cared that Su Nantian still had his neck in a grip and shouted desperately to Qiyā: “Qiyā, hurry! Save me!”

Hongye called for help while waving his hands excitedly, hoping Qiyā would come quickly to deal with Su Nantian and rescue him.

Qiyā had always valued Hongye as his adoptive father; that was why he rushed back now.

Seeing Hongye being restrained by Su Nantian, Qiyā immediately became angry.

He growled at Su Nantian: “Release my adoptive father, and I’ll let you leave with your body intact!”

“Let me leave with my body intact?”

Su Nantian raised an eyebrow and laughed, then asked in return.

This was the first time he had heard such a phrase; it naturally felt fresh.

Qiyā’s words were skillfully phrased—he wasn’t saying he would let Su Nantian go, but rather that he would spare his body intact. This meant Qiyā had no intention of considering Su Nantian as a rival in his mind.

After thinking this through, Su Nantian found it amusing.

He had encountered many overconfident opponents and people who sought their own downfall, but this was the first time he had heard Qiyā say such words and issue such a threat. So Su Nantian found it fresh and interesting.

“Alright, I’ll give you three seconds.”

Qiyā didn’t know Su Nantian’s words were playful or that he was mocking him. Upon hearing Su Nantian’s question, he thought Su Nantian was afraid of him and immediately answered.

Then he added a threat, as if Su Nantian didn’t obey his command, he wouldn’t show mercy.

After hearing Qiyā’s words, Su Nantian laughed again.

“Here’s what we’ll do: I’ll count to three, and then let go. If you can take Hongye back from my hands, this matter will be over. But if you fail, don’t interfere with me.”

After saying this, Su Nantian looked at Qiyā meaningfully. Though he had given him a choice, it was clearly an inevitable outcome.

Su Nantian believed in himself and would never be controlled by this Qiyā.

“You!”

Qiyā, who was straightforward and single-minded, frowned upon hearing Su Nantian’s words. His face showed confusion, as if unsure of what to do.

He didn’t know whether Su Nantian’s words were trustworthy, so he turned to Hongye and looked at him with inquiry, as if seeking an answer from Hongye.

But Su Nantian had not intended to give Qiyā a choice. So after saying this, he began counting: “One.”

He didn’t give Qiyā any time to react and immediately started counting, which startled Qiyā.

Hongye was also startled; he had been thinking about Su Nantian’s strategy and how to break it, but before he could speak, Su Nantian had already started counting. This was truly unexpected!

“You release my adoptive father!”

Qiyā, seeing Su Nantian start counting and even letting go of his grip, quickly regained his composure and rushed over.

Chapter 861: Failure

Qiyā struggled to reclaim Hongye, not allowing him to suffer Su Nantian’s bullying.

Qiyā now understood that Su Nantian had given him no chance to choose, but was merely playing a game with him.

After thinking this through, Qiyā’s gaze toward Su Nantian was full of resentment.

He had known it! This guy definitely had ill intentions; now he had already revealed his tail!

After thinking this through, Qiyā looked at Su Nantian with resentment, believing he shouldn’t have harmed his adoptive father.

Su Nantian wanted to play with Qiyā and see what kind of strength he had, which made Hongye look at him like a hope.

So Su Nantian deliberately counted slowly, having only reached “one” since he started and still had two more to go.

Qiyā saw Su Nantian’s slow counting and thought he was arrogant, but also felt relieved that the longer Su Nantian didn’t focus on this, the more chance he had to save Hongye.

After thinking this through, Qiyā rushed over immediately. Just as his fingers were about to touch Hongye, Su Nantian directly extended his hand and blocked him, pushing Qiyā back several steps.

“Qiyā!”

Hongye, seeing Qiyā coming over, felt like he had found hope and was happy to extend his hand to let Qiyā catch him. But before he could even touch, Su Nantian had already pushed him away.

Hongye let out a reluctant shout and tried to escape while Su Nantian was fighting with Qiyā.

But before he could take a step, Su Nantian had already focused his gaze on Hongye.

Actually, Su Nantian’s gaze was quite ordinary and had no threatening meaning; it was just that his displayed abilities were so powerful, making people feel uneasy.

“Players should abide by the game rules and not act on their own.”

Su Nantian said this meaningfully, subtly reminding Hongye not to try to run away.

When Hongye heard Su Nantian’s words, his shoulders suddenly shrank, and he felt cold all over. He hadn’t expected Su Nantian to still pay attention to him while fighting with Qiyā.

Moreover, although Su Nantian’s words were implicitly meaningful, Hongye immediately understood what Su Nantian meant.

He froze instantly and dared not move his feet or defy Su Nantian.

“That’s right.”

Su Nantian finally nodded in satisfaction and收回 his gaze, but his eyes were still constantly watching Hongye. If Hongye made any move, Su Nantian would directly deal with him and eliminate the threat.

“Adoptive father!”

Qiyā was pushed to the ground by Su Nantian, but upon seeing Hongye still in Su Nantian’s grip, he immediately got up, brushed off the dust on his body, and glared at Su Nantian angrily.

“Give back my adoptive father!”

He angrily questioned Su Nantian, wishing to tear him apart. But that was only if he had the ability.

“There are still two numbers left; it’s up to you whether you can seize this opportunity.”

Su Nantian saw Qiyā’s gaze and felt his interest growing.

At this moment, he seemed to see a small beast protecting its parents, desperately struggling and with blood in its eyes. This was something Su Nantian hadn’t found in the Hong family. That’s why Hongye had looked so surprised when he saw Qiyā—perhaps Qiyā’s abilities were far beyond the Hong family’s subordinates?

After thinking this through, Su Nantian looked at Qiyā with even more curiosity.

He waved his hand to signal him to come and fight again.

Qiyā still desperately wanted to save Hongye, seeing Su Nantian’s playful attitude and his hand signal. He completely treated himself as a plaything for Su Nantian, which made him extremely angry.

“Hmph!”

Qiyā let out a low growl, then forcefully stomped his foot on the ground. The floor immediately formed a large pit—this was beyond human capability, indicating Qiyā’s strength was incomparable to ordinary people.

“Oh, you have this ability too?”

After seeing Qiyā’s displayed power, Su Nantian was not afraid but instead felt surprised.

He now seemed to find this game more interesting. Su Nantian didn’t mind continuing the game and even thought that if he could tame Qiyā and make him his subordinate, it would be a good choice.

But seeing Qiyā so devotedly protecting Hongye, this idea was unlikely to be realized.

Qiyā’s intention was to use his ability to scare Su Nantian, making him know his strength and thus fear him. This was a tactic Qiyā often used against outsiders, and those people always jumped back in fear. The moment they were distracted, Qiyā could turn the situation around.

But he hadn’t expected that after displaying his strength, Su Nantian was not afraid but instead felt surprised. It seemed Su Nantian didn’t fear his ability at all.

After thinking this through, Qiyā’s gaze toward Su Nantian became even more serious. Even though his nature was simple and direct, he knew Su Nantian was no easy opponent.

But thinking about his adoptive father who had raised him, regardless of anything, Qiyā would protect Hongye and reclaim him from Su Nantian. So he wouldn’t fear Su Nantian.

He let out a low growl and, although Su Nantian didn’t fear his current ability, he would still charge forward to punch Su Nantian.

According to his usual strength, anyone hit by his fist would have all their bones shattered; the unlucky ones would turn into a pile of meat instantly, with no chance to resist.

No matter the result, it would be a fatal blow.

But Su Nantian was like Qiyā’s natural opponent; when Qiyā rushed forward, Su Nantian directly extended his hand and blocked Qiyā’s fist. Not only did it not turn into scraps, but he also easily caught Qiyā’s punch that had been fully powered.

“You!”

Qiyā stared at Su Nantian, then at his hand wrapped around his fist.

Su Nantian had no injuries at all; even more, he hadn’t taken a single step back. It was as if Su Nantian had just played with a child’s fist.

After thinking this through, Qiyā stared at Su Nantian again in shock.

Chapter 862: The Ugliness of Humanity

“You…”

Qiyā’s mouth was wide open, and he couldn’t close it for a long time.

When the other subordinates saw Qiyā appear, they also sighed in relief; like Hongye, they knew Qiyā’s abilities.

And these people also believed that Qiyā was their last shelter and the final card to save their lives.

They had all cheered when they saw Qiyā return, thinking they would definitely be able to drive Su Nantian out.

But who knew that even this powerful Qiyā was no match for Su Nantian!

Plus, Su Nantian had just displayed an eerie ability. Now these people were even more terrified of Su Nantian, their legs trembling.

Even though Su Nantian hadn’t given them a single extra glance, they now felt an overwhelming pressure, like waves crashing over them.

Many people couldn’t even stand straight under this pressure; many fell to their knees, and their eyes were filled with fear. No one could accept such a powerful Su Nantian.

“Two.”

Su Nantian didn’t observe his influence on others’ minds; he continued to speak slowly, saying one word.

This was his continuation of counting—meaning only one number left before he would take Hongye away and stop playing with Qiyā.

After thinking this through, Qiyā knew he had no time to be stunned and charged forward again. This time, he concentrated all his strength into his fist, preparing to catch Su Nantian off guard.

At the same time, he also kicked, preparing for a combined attack.

He thought his moves were fast enough that Su Nantian would be caught off guard. If he hit him once, Su Nantian would definitely be unable to resist.

After thinking this through, Qiyā gritted his teeth and gathered more strength, attacking Su Nantian.

“Your movements are too slow.”

At this moment, Su Nantian sighed and spoke with regret. He had thought Qiyā’s abilities were so great, but it turned out he was just strong in strength.

His movements were clumsy and not agile at all, and this made him seem like a showy facade.

After thinking this through, Su Nantian shook his head again and no longer had much interest in Qiyā.

The more this expression, the more this indifferent tone, indicated his patience was nearly exhausted.

Su Nantian had also been eager to find the Xu family and clarify his origins, but Qiyā’s sudden appearance with his superhuman strength had delayed Su Nantian for some time.

Now that Su Nantian knew Qiyā wasn’t as strong or interesting as he had imagined, he didn’t want to waste time playing with him anymore.

After hearing Su Nantian’s counting, Qiyā was very anxious; now he heard Su Nantian criticize his movements as too slow, and although he was angry, there was also a sense of resentment. He thought Su Nantian was just talking nonsense and trying to scare him.

He didn’t care about Su Nantian, continuing to punch and kick at Su Nantian.

“Ah! Die!”

Qiyā gritted his teeth and said this before forgetting his original intention.

He now only wanted to kill Su Nantian no matter what method he used; this person was too dangerous, more so than any enemy he had faced before.

“Earlier I said your movements are too slow, and you have too many flaws; I’ve already seen through them.”

Su Nantian shook his head again. He had already warned Qiyā, but the latter hadn’t followed his instructions.

After thinking this through, Su Nantian felt a bit sorry; he again easily blocked all of Qiyā’s attacks.

Qiyā was still the same as before; none of his punches landed on Su Nantian.

Moreover, while blocking Qiyā’s attacks, Su Nantian also spoke the word “Three” slowly.

The counting ended; Su Nantian lightly pushed Qiyā five steps away.

He could only stand steady with effort, otherwise he would have fallen in a clumsy manner and lost both face and dignity.

“Alright, the game is over. We had agreed that after three numbers, if you couldn’t reclaim Hongye from my hands, then you can’t interfere with what happens next.”

At this moment, Su Nantian spoke calmly and looked at the people. Those who met his gaze took a deep breath, none daring to look directly into Su Nantian’s eyes.

They were all Hongye’s people, who had gotten up from the ground with him. These people did the dirtiest and most dangerous things, having done everything and seen blood and fights. But none had ever met a person as terrifying as Su Nantian.

That’s why they felt insecure and were suppressed by Su Nantian, having no chance to resist.

Hongye had placed all his hopes on Qiyā; he thought his adopted son would be useful at this critical moment.

But it turned out that the latter was so useless, unable to even beat Su Nantian.

Hongye now began to blame Qiyā but forgot that his own abilities were even worse than Qiyā’s.

He hadn’t even had the chance to attack Su Nantian before being controlled by him.

But Hongye was always someone who blamed others and never thought of his own mistakes.

At this moment, Hongye’s face was ashen; he felt he had no hope of leaving Su Nantian’s grip.

But Qiyā at this moment wouldn’t give up: “Release my adoptive father! I’ll be your hostage!”

Qiyā clenched his fists. After fighting with Su Nantian, he had already realized he was no match for him; no matter how many times they fought, his only outcome would be failure.

So Qiyā didn’t continue to fight with Su Nantian but changed his approach; he thought if he became a hostage, he could exchange Hongye back. Then, if Su Nantian wanted to kill him, it wouldn’t matter.

Without waiting for Su Nantian’s answer, Hongye heard this proposal and saw a chance of survival. He stared with excitement and immediately said to Su Nantian: “Yes! My adoptive son is much more useful than me. Take him instead; it’s no use taking me to the Xu family!”

Hongye continued to speak excitedly, hoping Su Nantian would focus on Qiyā and let him go.

He was completely heartless at this moment, forgetting how Qiyā had sacrificed himself for him and how he had been willing to give his life.

Qiyā knew he was raised by Hongye and that Hongye had taken him from those places, otherwise he wouldn’t have grown up to this point. And Qiyā was willing to replace Hongye as Su Nantian’s hostage.

But it was one thing for Qiyā to be willing, and another for Hongye to push him out so quickly.

Even though Qiyā was simple-minded, he had feelings; thus, at this moment, he felt disappointed and lowered his gaze, feeling very sad.

Hongye noticed Qiyā’s change in expression and thought he was regretful, so he hurriedly shouted at Qiyā: “Qiyā, don’t forget I brought you back from outside! It was me who fed and raised you to this age! Now that I’m in trouble, you can’t just ignore me!”

After saying this, Hongye quickly said to Su Nantian: “Take him instead! I’m really useless. Take him to the Xu family; maybe he can help you!”

“Lord Hongye, I’m not unwilling.”

Qiyā spoke at this moment to Hongye.

Everyone noticed Qiyā’s change in address, from “adoptive father” to “Lord Hongye.”

Long ago, Qiyā had been proud and happy that he could have a unique name for Hongye. But now, he understood that as long as he truly regarded Hongye as his parents and was filial, it would be different.

But Hongye was merely using him as a tool to be called upon and dismissed at will; he only remembered his existence when he needed him.

Qiyā wasn’t complaining, because he knew he didn’t have the right to do so. But he felt sad—sad enough that he no longer wanted to consider Hongye as his adoptive father.

Like this, he had given his life for Hongye and repaid the debt of upbringing; now there was no more obligation.

“You’re all discussing so happily, but when did I say I would listen to your opinions?”

Su Nantian smiled and looked at Hongye, then at Qiyā. “Do you think I would accept anyone just because you switch people?”

But this human ugliness he had witnessed was quite interesting.

He thought Hongye’s words were the most foolish; now he had lost his only loyal subordinate.

But what did it matter? Soon, Hongye would lose his life anyway; whether or not these loyal subordinates stayed was meaningless.

“You…”

When Hongye heard Su Nantian’s words, his face became even more unpleasant. He had wanted to question Su Nantian but, upon meeting Su Nantian’s cold gaze, he swallowed his words and dared not speak again.

He lowered his head as if accepting fate, no longer making a sound.

“No! Su Nantian, let me replace my adoptive father! Please let me replace my adoptive father!”

Qiyā stepped forward and changed his address back again. No matter what, he hoped Su Nantian would let Hongye go; as for his own life, it didn’t matter.

But Su Nantian heard Qiyā’s words and wasn’t interested at all; he coldly glanced at him: “The previous agreement was clear. You lost, and you have no right to interfere with my decision.”

Then, Su Nantian directly raised his hand and created an air barrier in front of them all, blocking their steps and preventing them from shouting.

After doing this, Su Nantian grabbed Hongye by the collar and walked out quickly without looking back. He didn’t see Qiyā’s anxious expression.

“Alright, we’ve wasted enough time. Now you take me to the Xu family; remember not to play tricks, or I can still deal with you without moving a finger.”

Su Nantian grabbed Hongye by the collar and gave a few concise warnings. He didn’t have time to waste on Hongye’s long-winded talk.

Chapter 863: Disappointment

“Qiyā is much more useful than me. I’m just an old man; I can’t say anything in the Xu family. Taking me is useless!”

Hongye continued to speak excitedly, hoping Su Nantian would focus on Qiyā and let him go.

He was completely heartless, forgetting how Qiyā had sacrificed himself for him and how he had been willing to give his life.

Qiyā knew he was raised by Hongye and that Hongye had taken him from those places, otherwise he wouldn’t have grown up to this point. And Qiyā was willing to replace Hongye as Su Nantian’s hostage.

But it was one thing for Qiyā to be willing, and another for Hongye to push him out so quickly.

After saying this, Hongye quickly said to Su Nantian: “Take him instead! I’m really useless. Take him to the Xu family; maybe he can help you!”

“Lord Hongye, I’m not unwilling.”

Qiyā spoke at this moment to Hongye.

Everyone noticed Qiyā’s change in address, from “adoptive father” to “Lord Hongye.”

Long ago, Qiyā had been proud and happy that he could have a unique name for Hongye. But now, he understood that as long as he truly regarded Hongye as his parents and was filial, it would be different.
