“Wang Bo, what are you doing now?” Zhang Yuan initially did not directly state his purpose but instead asked cautiously.

After all, although he and Wang Bo were now forced to stand on the same side, they still could not fully trust each other. Zhang Yuan had always suspected that Wang Bo was the one who leaked the data initially, but now all evidence pointed to Li Zhe. Still, he remained doubtful about that incident.

“Today there’s a shipment arriving at the port, right? I’ve already counted the goods and my men are preparing to head to the inland port,” Wang Bo replied, explaining his current task. He had never planted a spy in Su Nantian’s camp because he already knew what would happen that day from Su Nantian himself. At this moment, he was not expecting to seize the goods but merely wanted to attend as a formality.

“Don’t you know what’s happening at the inland port right now?” Zhang Yuan continued, noting Wang Bo’s tone suggested he was unaware of the situation. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be so calm.

“Something happened at the inland port?” Wang Bo feigned confusion, but in reality, he already understood the situation. He was merely playing a role for Zhang Yuan.

Wang Bo’s current position was that he wanted to collaborate with the Nan Gong family but couldn’t establish contact. At the same time, he didn’t want to cooperate with Zhang Yuan yet had to appear as if they were on the same team.

“Did you not plant an agent there?” Zhang Yuan said again, disbelieving. He couldn’t believe Wang Bo would make such a mistake.

“An agent was planted, but what’s happened now? No one informed me. Maybe the spy didn’t want to return because of better treatment there?” Wang Bo feigned shock, as if his spy had defected.

Upon hearing this, Zhang Yuan slapped his forehead in frustration. This situation was indeed very complicated; he hadn’t expected Wang Bo’s side to have a defector.

“Alright, I’ll be direct. Today we’re expecting a shipment with some clandestine operations. We originally agreed to follow the old rules, but this time we can keep the money without giving it to Wu’s family or sharing with Nan Gong. Do you remember this?”

“Of course I do. We’re already preparing to go, right?” Wang Bo replied in agreement.

“But recently there’s been a shift. Li Zhe’s group is the largest now, and even combined with our forces, we’re still outnumbered. They’ve already gathered at the port and declared they’ll take all the goods for themselves, giving us no share. Instead, they’ll split the profits with Nan Gong.” Zhang Yuan spoke with clenched teeth; this was a direct attack on their interests, and there was no room for compromise.

“Damn it, what’s Li Zhe thinking? At least Nan Gong could be expected, but why would they break the rules? This is unacceptable. If we give in today, it’ll set a precedent for the entire year. Our men won’t get any money, and who would follow us then?”

Wang Bo continued his performance. He already knew the situation and had thought through it, but he saw no solution. Even if he and Zhang Yuan joined forces, they couldn’t match the strength of Nan Gong and Li Zhe’s alliance.

“We have no choice but to go all in. Both sides must unite. Let’s move quickly and meet at the inland port. Only by gathering our forces can we stand a chance against them.”

Zhang Yuan’s suggestion was met with immediate agreement. He and Wang Bo called their workers and rushed toward the inland port, instructing them to converge there. When they arrived, the shipment had not yet arrived.

But they saw the entire inland port illuminated with lights, and a large group of workers stood at the dock waiting for the goods. Li Zhe sat with Su Nantian on a bench, looking remarkably relaxed.

The workers’ expressions were all cheerful; many had just received rewards from Su Nantian, so they appeared energetic and undeterred by the long hours.

Upon seeing this, Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo frowned, observing how the workers were now satisfied with Li Zhe and Su Nantian.

Chapter 629: Humble Submission

When Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo arrived at the inland port, Su Nantian and Li Zhe had already seen them. However, they remained seated without moving, waiting for the shipment to arrive.

The workers also saw them and began preparing, as Li Zhe and Su Nantian had clearly stated that only they would handle the goods.

“Stay here with the workers, and don’t move until I give the order. Everyone stay put,” Zhang Yuan instructed his trusted men, telling them to watch over the remaining workers.

But these workers were unaware of what was happening; they only knew they had come to move the goods. They hadn’t anticipated Su Nantian and Li Zhe’s plan to exclude them from the profits.

After Zhang Yuan spoke, he glanced at Wang Bo, and they nodded to each other before heading toward Su Nantian and Li Zhe.

Zhang Yuan no longer wanted to beat around the bush; he walked up and said, “What’s your intention? My people have already informed me that you don’t want us to touch this private operation. The tradition at the inland port has always been that workers share in the profits. Even when Wu’s family was here, they only took a cut. They never said we couldn’t keep the profits. Why would Nan Gong, who’s only been here a year, change everything so abruptly? Isn’t that against the rules?”

After Zhang Yuan spoke, Wang Bo felt he should add something and said, “Indeed, the inland port has its own rules. You’ve only been here a year, but you’re already changing everything. This has thrown the entire inland port into chaos. Isn’t that a bit unfair?”

Su Nantian’s response was merely a faint smile: “Don’t question how long Nan Gong has been in power. Even if it were only a month, I could change the rules. Besides, this year has been long enough. You say ‘rules,’ but didn’t you break them first, forcing me to act? You know well that when you smuggled goods before, you gave a cut to Wu’s family. Why then, when Nan Gong arrived, did you keep the money for yourselves?”

Su Nantian’s words left Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo speechless. It was true they had acted unethically, exploiting Nan Gong’s unfamiliarity with the area to manipulate the workers and seize the profits.

But they hadn’t expected Su Nantian to have already uncovered their plan and turned it against them. Now, the majority of the workers’ profits were in Li Zhe’s hands, and it seemed Li Zhe was loyal to Nan Gong. He aimed to use this opportunity to rise in the inland port and would not betray them again.

Moreover, besides these workers, Nan Gong had also sent many guards. Even if Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo tried to incite a revolt, they would be suppressed immediately.

Zhang Yuan realized he had already lost this battle unless he now submitted and showed weakness, which might offer a chance for redemption. If he resisted, there would be no good outcome.

Zhang Yuan lowered his head in thought, his fists clenching tightly. Wang Bo observed Zhang Yuan’s demeanor and felt curiosity; he had never seen Zhang Yuan submit before. For years, Zhang Yuan had ruled the inland port smoothly, always holding the upper hand. Even Wu’s family had met him with respect.

“I admit we were unscrupulous. We thought Nan Gong was new and unfamiliar with the area, so we colluded with these workers to keep the profits. We thought they’d get more money too. But now, your actions have put us in a difficult position. Our men need this money to survive. I apologize to Nan Gong; from now on, we won’t hinder you in the inland port. Please grant our men a path to survival.”

After much deliberation, Zhang Yuan realized that apologizing was the best choice. This private operation wasn’t just one; there were many throughout the year. If all were blocked by Su Nantian’s group, their situation would be dire.

Even Li Zhe was surprised by Zhang Yuan’s submission; he had never seen him bow to anyone before. But now, he was humbling himself before Su Nantian.

Li Zhe couldn’t decide for Su Nantian; he simply sat there, waiting for Su Nantian to speak.

Su Nantian smiled again and said, “Now you’ve learned to submit for money. You weren’t so patient before.”

“I’m not doing this just for myself but for these men too. They work grueling labor at the dock, and their monthly pay is limited. They have families to support. Those who take physical jobs lack education, so they can only sell their strength. How many years of youth do you have? When your body weakens, you’ll be unable to work. So it’s better to save money while young; these are their additional incomes.”

Zhang Yuan’s words moved even Su Nantian’s workers, who lowered their heads with sorrow.

Su Nantian had already planned his response; he knew that continuing to exclude the remaining workers would only provoke anger.

“I hope you remember what you said today. I don’t want to force these dockworkers into desperation. Nan Gong only stays here for a year. If we cooperate peacefully during this time, Nan Gong will profit and leave without harming you. But when Li Hong’s group arrived, you obstructed them constantly. This is all true.”

“This was our mistake; we wanted to take advantage of this year to gain more. But I promise, from now on, we won’t oppose Nan Gong. So please grant these men a path to survival.” Zhang Yuan continued humbly.

Chapter 630: Regret

Su Nantian observed Zhang Yuan’s attitude and knew he wouldn’t cause trouble in the future, but at least he had now conceded.

Moreover, Su Nantian understood that excluding the remaining workers long-term wouldn’t bring peace to the inland port.

In fact, Su Nantian had already planned how to conclude this from the beginning.

“Since you’ve sincerely apologized and for your men’s sake, I’ll give you a chance. But today I’ve already promised my people that the money from this shipment will go to them, with each receiving an additional two hundred yuan. I can’t break my word. If you truly apologize, then this time, you and your men will help unload the goods, but I won’t give you a single penny. However, if there are future private operations, we’ll divide the profits according to the new ratio. If you accept, bring them over; if not, we’ll stick to the old rules.”

Su Nantian’s stance was firm because he had already committed to these people. If he changed his mind now and let them lose money, Su Nantian knew the consequences would be dire.

Upon hearing this, Zhang Yuan initially wanted to say something but stopped when he heard the latter part. He nodded and glanced at Wang Bo.

Wang Bo also nodded to Zhang Yuan, indicating he had agreed to the terms. So Zhang Yuan said to Su Nantian: “Fine, I accept all your demands. Today I’ll bring my men to help you unload the goods. But in the future, how will we divide the profits? This should be clarified.”

Zhang Yuan feared that the future ratio would be too low, so he wanted Su Nantian to confirm it first.

“Now you’re negotiating with me? You have no say. First, bring your men to help unload the goods. We’ll discuss the ratio later.” Su Nantian was no fool; he wouldn’t promise anything now. Moreover, some matters were complex, and he couldn’t give a clear answer yet.

After hearing Su Nantian’s words, Zhang Yuan wanted to get angry but realized he had no leverage to bargain. He could only nod and return to his workers.

“I need to tell you something. I know what’s happened at the inland port recently. You’re more aware of the rumors than I am. Today there was a private operation, but due to some issues, I made the wrong decision. You’ll only work today and won’t get any money from this shipment.”

Before Zhang Yuan finished speaking, there was a stir among the crowd. Someone shouted: “Why should we work without pay? I’m not doing it.”

This person’s words were echoed by many. They refused to work without pay and would only unload the regular goods, not this private shipment.

“I knew some of you would think like that, but I need to clarify: if you don’t work today and leave immediately, you’ll never get any more jobs or money. If you endure this time and finish the job, we can still participate in future private operations. In short, the inland port’s leader has changed. You decide whether to stay or leave. If you want to stay, do the job; if not, you can walk out now and skip this shipment entirely.”

After Zhang Yuan said this, those who had previously protested fell silent. They didn’t speak again but stood among the crowd. They would never abandon their jobs.

After all, working at the inland port was better than outside; they had done many physical jobs before, like building houses or moving bricks, but in the end, the inland port offered better treatment.

If they gave up this job now, they would be desperate. Thinking about it, working for one day and getting some money was better than losing everything now.

“Good, since no one is leaving, I’ll take it as agreement. Work hard now; I’ll compensate you later.”

Zhang Yuan said this, feeling some guilt. He knew the current situation was entirely his fault. If he had cooperated with Nan Gong according to Wu’s family’s original ratio, they would have remained in the same state.

But he had hoped to take advantage of Nan Gong’s unfamiliarity with the inland port, aiming to gain more profit in this year. However, he hadn’t expected everything would turn upside down like this.

At the same time, Wang Bo approached his workers and said: “What Zhang Yuan just said is clear. You all decide for yourselves.”

After Wang Bo spoke, his workers nodded in agreement and didn’t leave.

So Wang Bo and Zhang Yuan went again toward Su Nantian and Li Zhe.

“They’ve agreed,” Zhang Yuan said.

“If that’s the case, once the goods arrive, everyone start working.” However, Su Nantian hadn’t spoken long before he saw a group of cars approaching from the distance, honking to signal that the goods had arrived.

“Alright, start working.” Li Zhe stood up and clapped his hands, signaling the workers to follow him.

Previously, this job had been Zhang Yuan’s responsibility, but now that the inland port’s leader had changed, it was Li Zhe who took over.

Zhang Yuan watched this scene and felt a mix of emotions. He hadn’t expected his greed to lead him into such a situation.

He also knew how difficult it was to change the inland port’s power dynamics. Unless he, like Li Zhe, had the support of Nan Gong’s massive force, it was impossible.

But why would Wu’s family support him? Wu’s family only wanted peace at the inland port. They didn’t care who was the local boss, so Zhang Yuan might never return to his former position.

Chapter 631: Negotiation

Zhang Yuan watched this scene, and as Li Zhe gave the order, all workers began working as before. He knew he had already lost control of the inland port. Even if Wu’s family returned, he wouldn’t be able to recover.

Su Nantian watched this scene with amusement and closely observed Zhang Yuan’s expression. When he saw the faint trace of sorrow on Zhang Yuan’s face, he let out a laugh.

Although Zhang Yuan looked pitiable now, pitiable people always have their faults. From the beginning, when Zhang Yuan opposed heaven, he had already sown the seeds of his downfall.

Nan Gong had controlled Wu’s inland port for only one year, but they hadn’t even allowed a peaceful transition. If Zhang Yuan and his local bosses had treated them politely from the start, following Wu’s family’s previous approach, none of this would have happened.

But all of it stemmed from Zhang Yuan’s greed. If he hadn’t wanted to take advantage of Nan Gong’s unfamiliarity with the area and tried to seize more profits, he wouldn’t have ended up in this situation.

As a result, Zhang Yuan’s power had been greatly weakened now. He could only split the remaining strength with Wang Bo, while the most powerful was clearly Li Zhe, who had been supported by Su Nantian.

In fact, Su Nantian had already planned that if he completely abandoned the remaining workers, it would only cause chaos in the inland port. So today, he had taken advantage of Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo’s arrival to involve them in this situation. However, he would set a new ratio.

According to normal work progress, they completed the shipment within two hours, including all private goods.

The workers were naturally sent back to rest since they had regular work to do during the day, but Su Nantian and his group immediately started a meeting to discuss the profit-sharing ratio.

Su Nantian wasn’t in a hurry, but Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo were. If they didn’t coordinate the ratio quickly, they would likely get only a small portion of the money in the future.

Wang Bo still wanted to try to build a relationship with Su Nantian, hoping to collaborate with Nan Gong. However, Zhang Yuan knew that even if he tried again, Nan Gong wouldn’t cooperate with him now.

After the work was done, Su Nantian, Li Zhe, Wang Bo, and Zhang Yuan sat in the office to negotiate the ratio for future private goods.

Nan Gong’s leader, Nan Gong Fei, was essentially just a figurehead, so his presence or absence didn’t matter.

Su Nantian and Li Zhe sat on one side, both appearing confident because they were the ones in control. Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo were merely passive participants, and how much they could get was entirely Su Nantian’s decision.

“Speak up. What are your thoughts?” Su Nantian didn’t immediately state his demands but first asked Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo to see what they thought.

“Normally, everything at the inland port remains as it is. If the power dynamics have changed, then we follow the new arrangement. We don’t complain; whoever has the strength becomes the leader. Since you Nan Gong family are supporting Li Zhe, it’s natural for him to be the leader.”

Zhang Yuan said this, being fair in this matter. He wasn’t angry about his power dynamics shrinking.

He had already realized the situation was unchangeable; otherwise, others would have easily overthrown him when he was the local boss. It was because he had climbed to that height that he knew how difficult it was to be overthrown.

Only someone like Li Zhe, who had luck on his side and was supported by Nan Gong, could be elevated to this position. Without Nan Gong’s support, anyone trying to overthrow his position would find it extremely difficult.

So Zhang Yuan no longer dwelled on this; he now only wanted to stabilize everything and recover the profits from the private goods. If he missed this part, it wouldn’t just affect himself but also his men’s losses would be significant.

Don’t underestimate the short year; they had smuggled goods countless times. If they couldn’t participate each time, the annual loss would be massive.

“I agree with this too. We mainly want the money from these private goods. As I said before, I can forgo this time’s payment but want a certain ratio in the future.”

Wang Bo nodded, agreeing with Zhang Yuan’s thoughts. He also thought this way.

This time, the biggest impact was on Zhang Yuan; Wang Bo’s previous power was greater than his now, but he hadn’t suffered much. However, if this private goods weren’t shared with them, Wang Bo’s loss would be significant.

After hearing Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo’s words, Su Nantian nodded and said: “It seems our ideas are consistent. Other matters at the inland port will follow previous principles. Since Li Zhe is now the most powerful, he naturally deserves the same treatment as Zhang Yuan had before. As for this private goods matter? I’ve already agreed to you, and from now on, it will be divided according to a certain ratio. But what ratio do you think is appropriate? What are your thoughts?”

Su Nantian had already decided on a ratio in his mind, but he wanted to see how sincere Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo were. If they could stay within his range, it would be a mutual agreement. However, if they tried to increase the ratio further, Su Nantian wouldn’t be so lenient.

“Right, you two speak up. What do you think the ratio should be? Let’s see what your thoughts are.” Li Zhe also added, now fully aligned with Nan Gong. He knew that under these circumstances, only by standing with Nan Gong could he consolidate his position within this year.

Chapter 632: Deterrence

Upon hearing this, Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo exchanged glances. They both knew they had to discuss the ratio but hadn’t expected it would be them who proposed it.

Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo had initially thought Su Nantian’s group would give them a ratio to accept. But now, they were being asked to propose their own demands, which made them uneasy.

Wang Bo immediately looked to Zhang Yuan for help because Zhang Yuan had been the original local boss. Wang Bo subconsciously passed the problem to him, and Zhang Yuan instinctively took it on.

“We previously divided with Wu’s family at a 70-30 ratio, with us taking 70% and Wu’s family 30%. This was symbolic; we gave them a small cut, while the rest were distributed as welfare and additional bonuses to our men. Then we divided this 70% among ourselves based on our respective power dynamics. I think following the previous arrangement would be fine.”

“Of course, our current power dynamics are different now. We’ll divide according to the new situation.”

Zhang Yuan felt his words were moderate and followed the previous rules. He believed if he proposed this, there would be no reason for them to refuse.

Wang Bo nodded in agreement and said: “This approach is also good; it’s the same as before. However, our current teams are different now. It’s not complicated; just adjust slightly based on the new power dynamics.”

Wang Bo was merely cooperating now. He didn’t want to offend Su Nantian and Nan Gong but also didn’t want to oppose Zhang Yuan. He knew Li Zhe wouldn’t cooperate with him, so he had to stick to Zhang Yuan’s side and also please Su Nantian and Nan Gong. Thus, playing the middle ground was the best option now.

But when they both spoke, Su Nantian and Li Zhe smiled, as their previous ratio proposal was clearly absurd.

Su Nantian and Li Zhe had already privately agreed on a 50-50 split without considering Wang Bo and Zhang Yuan. This meant they would get much more than the previous ratio. However, if they reverted to Wang Bo and Zhang Yuan’s proposal, they would be fools.

Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo looked at the two smiling men and felt confused about their reaction, but they could sense that their proposed ratio was not to their liking. In fact, it seemed absurd to them.

“This ratio is obviously unsuitable. If we could continue with Wu’s family’s arrangement, why did you refuse it when Nan Gong arrived? You had to pay the price for your actions. You wanted to take advantage of Nan Gong’s unfamiliarity with the inland port and secretly seize the private goods, so you should have anticipated this day. Now you’re still thinking of using the old ratio to divide money? That’s absurd and ridiculous.”

Upon hearing Su Nantian’s words, Zhang Yuan clenched his fists under the table. He knew Su Nantian had deliberately asked him to propose this ratio to mock him at this moment.

But Zhang Yuan could only endure it, as Su Nantian’s words were true. He had indeed wanted to take advantage of Wu’s family’s one-year leadership over the inland port to bully the new Nan Gong and gain more money.

Moreover, Zhang Yuan understood that gambling had consequences; since he now found himself in Su Nantian and Nan Gong’s hands, whatever humiliation they inflicted on him, he could only endure it.

Unless he abandoned everything and gave up the inland port entirely to regain his freedom, he would no longer be under Nan Gong’s and Su Nantian’s control. But he finally couldn’t let go of this business, which he had built over many years. Although he was still a worker at the inland port now, he had many men under him and earned considerable money each month. If he started over again, he lacked the courage to do so.

So Zhang Yuan’s hand clenched into a fist under the table, his veins bulging, but on the surface, he could only smile and say: “I already knew my proposed ratio was inappropriate. I want to know what ratio you plan to share with us.”

Su Nantian smiled and said: “I’ll tell you. Before we included you in this plan, Li Zhe and I divided it 50-50. I know you previously had a 70-30 split with Wu’s family, but Li Zhe and I have a 50-50 division. So consider how we should divide it if you join us.”

Upon hearing this, both Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo were shocked. They hadn’t expected the ratio to be so low.

“50-50? That’s too high…” Even Wang Bo, who wanted to befriend Nan Gong, found this ratio unacceptable.

“That’s the division Li Zhe and I agreed on. But now we need to adjust it with you. What do you think is appropriate?”

After saying this, Su Nantian still looked at Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo with a sly expression. They felt uneasy, as Su Nantian now seemed like a hunting tiger, while Zhang Yuan and Wang Bo were the prey waiting to be devoured.

“We’ll follow your arrangement. Whatever ratio you give us, we’ll accept it.”

Wang Bo said this because he knew the ratio had already been decided in Su Nantian’s mind. No matter what they finally agreed, it would still be the same ratio.

Su Nantian’s words were meant to intimidate them, as only by making them fully accept and submit could their power in the inland port be truly established. This way, Nan Gong could ensure a smooth year ahead without interference from other forces in the inland port.

Chapter 633: Reality

“You!” Zhang Yuan hadn’t expected Wang Bo to agree so quickly. He had thought Wang Bo would still be on his side, but he submitted so fast that Zhang Yuan was angry. However, he held back because Su Nantian and Li Zhe were right in front of him. He only growled once without saying more.

Wang Bo saw Zhang Yuan’s anger and immediately grabbed his arm, smiling at Su Nantian and Li Zhe: “Let me take Zhang Yuan out to discuss. After we talk, I’ll come back and tell you the final result, okay?”

Su Nantian nodded and waved his hand with a smile: “Of course. You two go out to discuss. But don’t take too long; give you ten minutes at most. After ten minutes, I need the answer. If you agree, we’ll proceed with this plan; if not, I can’t promise what will happen.”

Although Su Nantian smiled, his words were clearly threatening. His meaning was clear: the profit-sharing ratio would be this way; they had to accept it, whether they liked it or not.

“Okay, okay. We’ll be back soon. Please wait a moment.” Wang Bo smiled and pulled Zhang Yuan out of the room.

After they walked some distance away from the room, Zhang Yuan finally broke free from Wang Bo’s grip and said angrily: “What did we say before? We must stand on the same side no matter what. Why did you accept this ratio? How much money will we get after this division?”

Zhang Yuan’s dissatisfaction wasn’t about the total amount of money they received but that this division would significantly reduce their share as local bosses.

Although he still earned more than other workers, this arrangement would greatly reduce his personal income.

“Not that I’m not standing with you on the same side, but this is how it is. If we don’t agree with Su Nantian, he can completely absorb the remaining workers and leave us out. Do you think today we came to negotiate? We just came to receive instructions. If you don’t agree, you won’t even get the chance to hear the instructions; you’ll be excluded immediately.

Up to now, Wu’s family hasn’t moved at all. Do you think they have no eyes in the inland port? Wu Chuan definitely knows everything, but he hasn’t sent anyone or made a statement. That’s because he thinks Su Nantian did the right thing and that Nan Gong’s actions benefit Wu’s family in the future.

This ratio division is something we must accept, whether we like it or not. If you agree, you can keep your position and get this money; maybe one day you can even hope to return to your former position. If you don’t agree, you’ll be excluded immediately. Do you think you want to start over from scratch as a worker?

So this is the situation now. The inland port isn’t what it used to be. Nan Gong has invested so much effort to disrupt their order, and they have confidence in maintaining it. Wu’s family knows about this but doesn’t interfere because it benefits them too.

Do you think you can fight against Nan Gong or Wu’s family? If you believe you have that strength, why care about such a small profit?”

Wang Bo’s words were like a bucket of cold water on Zhang Yuan’s head, extinguishing his previous anger and confusion.

Zhang Yuan had thought he understood everything clearly, that the inland port’s power shift meant he should compromise and accept it. But upon hearing this ratio, he became angry again, thinking he could fight for it.

But after Wang Bo’s words, Zhang Yuan realized he didn’t even have the right to fight. He was only here because Su Nantian gave him this opportunity. If Su Nantian didn’t give him the chance to negotiate, he could just inform him once and be done with it. No matter if he accepted or not, the situation would remain unchanged, unaffected by his choice.
