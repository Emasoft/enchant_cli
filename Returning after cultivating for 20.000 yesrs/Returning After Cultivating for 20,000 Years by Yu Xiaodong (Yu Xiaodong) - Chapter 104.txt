“Because of this, the man said to Su Nantian: 'Lantian, the master has summoned you. You need not follow him up for now.'”

Su Nantian had known this moment would arrive, but he hadn’t expected Nan Gong Lin to be so impatient. He had just returned and was still unsteady on his feet when he was called over.

Yet Su Nantian remained respectfully nodding, saying: “I understand. I will go now.”

After speaking, Su Nantian walked toward Nan Gong Lin’s villa.

Upon entering the villa, he found Nan Gong Lin seated on a sofa in the hall waiting for him. Beside him were two men Su Nantian was very familiar with—Zhang Yu and Zeng Chao, the ones he had injured.

Though these two had returned from the hospital, their wounds were clearly not yet healed; bandages still wrapped their injuries.

Moreover, upon seeing Su Nantian enter, both men’s gazes turned sharp. It was evident they had come to settle a score.

Chapter 512: Punishment

Su Nantian had long sensed the danger, but he pressed forward regardless. After all, he needed to continue his infiltration within the Nan Gong family. Until he rescued Wu You’er and Wu Tao’s couple, he could not abandon his identity as the family’s bodyguard.

This was an ideal position to connect with other clans. Losing it would make it extremely difficult to integrate into the major families and access their core.

Yet, despite being merely a bodyguard in the Nan Gong family, Su Nantian was crucial to Nan Gong Ping. Moreover, through this recent competition for the Wu family’s inheritance, he had developed unique emotional ties with both Nan Gong Yuyan and Nan Gong Ping.

Though he still appeared as a bodyguard, Su Nantian could feel their reliance on him had surpassed that of a mere protector.

After entering, Su Nantian immediately stood respectfully before Nan Gong Lin and said: “Master, I heard you called for me.”

Nan Gong Lin had nodded before, but the next moment he immediately changed expression. He slammed his staff onto the ground and said: “You are the少爷’s bodyguard; your duty is to protect his safety. Yet after going to the Wu family, look at how the少爷 returned! What do you have to say for this?”

After hearing this, Su Nantian said nothing and remained standing obediently.

“Don’t you have anything to say? I’ll give you a chance to explain. If your reasoning convinces me, I won’t punish you.”

Su Nantian hadn’t expected Nan Gong Lin to say this. He immediately realized Nan Gong Lin was testing him, fishing for a trap. If he revealed the truth and shifted blame onto Nan Gong Ping, Nan Gong Lin would have a legitimate reason to expel him from the Nan Gong family.

Thus, Su Nantian only shook his head and said: “This time I failed to protect the少爷. All fault lies with me. Master, do as you wish.”

Upon hearing this, Nan Gong Lin was genuinely surprised.

Humanity has a common flaw—habitually blaming others for their mistakes, fabricating endless excuses. Moreover, Nan Gong Lin had already learned about this incident earlier. When Nan Gong Yuyan contacted the family’s liaison to retrieve Nan Gong Ping, she had already explained the details. Thus, he knew that it was actually Nan Gong Ping who hadn’t listened to Su Nantian’s advice and insisted on leaving his room, giving the bandits an opportunity to harm him.

Therefore, although Su Nantian had failed in his duty, the primary cause of the mistake was Nan Gong Ping himself.

Hence, Nan Gong Lin appreciated Su Nantian’s refusal to defend himself and his willingness to take full responsibility. However, this did not prevent him from punishing Su Nantian.

“Good. Since that’s the case, you’ve admitted your fault. I’ll punish you according to the Nan Gong family’s rules. You two, tell me how he should be punished,” Nan Gong Lin said, addressing Zhang Yu and Zeng Chao.

From the beginning, Su Nantian had known this summons was not merely to reprimand him but primarily to avenge these two men. Though he had defeated them with his strength, for Nan Gong Lin, they had been in the family for a long time and shared bonds. Moreover, one was Nan Gong Lin’s man, and the other was Nan Gong Yuyan’s. Their faces had been deeply insulted by Su Nantian.

Thus, now that they had the chance to punish Su Nantian, they would also seek to ease their resentment.

Zhang Yu and Zeng Chao were delighted that the initiative now rested in their hands. However, they knew they couldn’t go too far; they could not expel Su Nantian entirely. After all, his strength was undeniable. Assigning him as Nan Gong Ping’s bodyguard ensured the latter’s safety moving forward.

Moreover, they had been in the Nan Gong family long enough to understand Nan Gong Lin’s temperament. This was a gesture of reassurance, telling them that even if the family had stronger bodyguards now, their positions would not be threatened. It was also to encourage them to serve the Nan Gong family more loyally in the future.

After discussing, Zeng Chao spoke for both: “Master, if we must punish him, let us also have him contribute to the Nan Gong family.”

“Ah? It seems you’ve already formed a plan. How can we punish him while also having him contribute to the Nan Gong family? Please elaborate.”

Nan Gong Lin was intrigued and asked, raising his eyebrows.

“Everyone knows that even in a city like Jingdu, though it appears prosperous on the surface, there are hidden dark areas. Our Nan Gong family’s business has infiltrated every district here. Thus, in these dark regions, we also have our operations. However, local triads control these areas, and we must give them some benefits each time.

I suggest sending Lantian to try to settle these triads. This would reduce our losses, and with fewer benefits given, our profits would increase. Moreover, our family members in that area would no longer be bullied.”

Zeng Chao smiled as he spoke. Though he was a bodyguard of the Nan Gong family, he was also effectively the head of their security. Thus, he had control over all the security at every business location under the Nan Gong family’s umbrella. He naturally knew these areas well.

Indeed, in certain parts of Jingdu, the local triads were so rampant that even with their own security systems, they had to give them some tribute to maintain peace. The accumulated costs were considerable.

And money was not the most important issue; even after paying protection fees, they were sometimes still bullied by these triads. Thus, these areas became places many avoided, causing losses for the Nan Gong family’s business—this was Zeng Chao’s most troublesome region.

Chapter 513: Awakening

After hearing Zeng Chao’s words, Su Nantian sighed helplessly. He knew this issue was truly troublesome. If it were easy to resolve, the Nan Gong family wouldn’t have left it for so long. Moreover, Zeng Chao was clearly using this to challenge him.

But Su Nantian also knew he couldn’t refuse this task.

Nan Gong Lin nodded and said: “Your suggestion is quite good.”

Then he looked at Su Nantian and asked: “How about you? Are you willing to go?”

Su Nantian thought, what did it matter if he was willing or not? If he said no, would Nan Gong Lin let him off?

Thus, Su Nantian could only nod and say: “I am willing to share the family’s burdens. I will do my utmost to resolve this matter, and even if I fail, I’ll try to improve the situation.”

Nan Gong Lin hadn’t expected Su Nantian to agree so readily. But since he had, he naturally wouldn’t object. Even if Su Nantian failed to resolve the issue, he would let him stay there for a while before returning. He wouldn’t leave him there permanently.

But if Su Nantian could resolve the issue, it would be an unexpected blessing for him.

“Good. Then proceed as Zeng Chao said. Return and prepare, then depart tomorrow. As for Nan Gong Ping, temporarily assign him to Wang Meng. Recently, he needs proper rest and won’t go out; within the Nan Gong family, he is safe. You needn’t worry.”

After saying this, Nan Gong Lin waved his hand, signaling Su Nantian to leave.

Thus, Su Nantian bowed respectfully to Nan Gong Lin and left his villa, heading toward Nan Gong Ping’s residence.

After returning to Nan Gong Lin’s villa, Su Nantian found medical staff guarding outside. Yet everyone looked relaxed. So he asked one of the nurses: “Excuse me, what is our少爷’s condition?”

The nurse smiled immediately upon hearing Su Nantian and said: “Don’t worry. He has already awakened. His head has a minor injury, but no other wounds.”

“Thank you.”

After thanking the nurse, Su Nantian immediately headed toward Nan Gong Ping’s room. When he reached the door, he found Nan Gong Yuyan already inside speaking with Nan Gong Ping.

Perhaps Su Nantian stood silently at the door waiting for their conversation to end.

After a while, Nan Gong Yuyan seemed to have concluded her discussion with Nan Gong Ping. She got up and left, then asked Su Nantian: “Did your father summon you to punish you?”

Su Nantian could only smile and nod.

“Then how did he punish you?” Nan Gong Yuyan continued.

“He didn’t punish me in the usual way. He sent me to a district in Jingdu to deal with these local triads, so that the Nan Gong family’s business can develop more smoothly.”

After Su Nantian said this, he noticed a strange expression on Nan Gong Yuyan’s face. Then she said: “This must be Zeng Chao and Zhang Yu’s idea. These two have been troubled by these matters for a long time but couldn’t resolve them. They’ve finally passed the burden onto you. Well, since you have to go, I hope you manage.”

After saying this, Nan Gong Yuyan turned without looking back and left.

“Master, you’ve finally awakened. I was truly worried about you,” Su Nantian said as he entered the room and addressed Nan Gong Ping.

“This time isn’t your fault. I was too curious and left without waiting for your signal to check with Wang Meng,” Nan Gong Ping did not blame Su Nantian, as he knew the issue was largely his own.

Suddenly, he asked: “I just heard you and Yuyan talking about punishment. Did your father punish you?”

Su Nantian nodded and recounted the previous conversation to Nan Gong Ping.

“Sending you to deal with these matters—then who will be my bodyguard? I should go talk to your father and have him change the punishment,” Nan Gong Ping said, attempting to get up from bed.

In truth, Su Nantian knew this didn’t reflect their relationship being particularly close. It was simply that he had finally become the Nan Gong family’s top bodyguard, and for Nan Gong Ping, this was very important.

From the beginning, Su Nantian had noticed that Nan Gong Yuyan had a formidable bodyguard, and Nan Gong Lin naturally had one as well. At that time, Nan Gong Ping’s bodyguard was merely average in talent, so he had been troubled by it.

Now that he had finally obtained Su Nantian, but now Su Nantian was being sent away—how could he accept it?

Su Nantian immediately stopped him, saying: “There’s no need to argue with your father over this. And this is indeed my fault. Moreover, your father said that during his recovery, you should stay in the Nan Gong family and rest properly. There’s no need to worry about your safety. I’ll just be away for a while. If I can resolve this issue, it’s good; if not, your father won’t let me stay there permanently. If you get into a conflict with your father over this, it would be a loss.”

After hearing Su Nantian’s words, Nan Gong Ping, who had been impulsive, gradually calmed down.

Nan Gong Ping nodded and said: “You’re right. It would be a loss to quarrel over such trivial matters. However, Lantian, don’t worry—I won’t let you stay there too long. Once the timing is right, regardless of whether you succeed or not, I’ll ask your father to let you return.”

“Thank you, Master,” Su Nantian also nodded and said.

After exchanging a few words with Nan Gong Ping, Su Nantian returned to his room to pack his belongings. After all, he would depart directly tomorrow for the area Zeng Chao mentioned. Naturally, he needed to prepare well tonight.

Moreover, the information and gains from his visit to the Wu family were considerable. Su Nantian needed to calm down and organize them. Only by connecting all these pieces could he determine his next steps, as Wu You’er and Wu Tao were not together. Thus, a more meticulous plan was needed to rescue them both.

This opportunity to leave the Nan Gong family also allowed Su Nantian to connect with the outside world, sending his information and necessary items openly to his people for preparation.

Chapter 514: Ruohai District

When Su Nantian prepared to leave the Nan Gong family the next morning, he found that Zeng Chao had only sent someone to deliver a note and a key to him.

Su Nantian looked at the key and note in his hand and asked: “What does this mean?”

The man replied: “It’s the key to your car and a note from Zeng Ge. The note has the address you need to go to. You can drive there yourself. Once you arrive, someone will meet you.”

After saying this, the man left immediately. Su Nantian couldn’t help but smile; it felt like he was being exiled, but at least he had a car to drive. He hadn’t been forced to find his way there himself, which was quite generous of Zeng Chao.

However, he hadn’t expected this scene to be witnessed by Nan Gong Ping, who had just come out. “Zeng Chao is really overstepping! Sending you to such a place and only letting you drive yourself. I’ll go argue with him,” Nan Gong Ping said, clearly angry.

“Master, there’s no need. With the car and address, I can find my way. You don’t have to get angry with your father’s people over this, which might create a rift between you and him. Moreover, having a car to drive is already quite good treatment.”

As he said this, Su Nantian waved the key in his hand. If he wasn’t mistaken, this car was worth around 400,000 yuan—quite a good one.

But Su Nantian thought again; this car was probably the worst in the Nan Gong family’s garage.

After hearing Su Nantian’s words, Nan Gong Ping nodded and patted his shoulder: “Alright, don’t feel pressured. Just go with the flow. Zeng Chao’s task is clearly to trouble you. In a few days, I’ll go ask your father to let you return. I won’t let you stay there too long.”

After hearing this, Su Nantian smiled at Nan Gong Ping. However, he also thought to himself that he couldn’t stay there too long; otherwise, how could he return to rescue Wu You’er and Wu Tao?

But if he stayed there waiting for Nan Gong Ping to plead with Nan Gong Lin to let him return, it would be better if he went and checked the situation himself. If it was indeed possible to resolve things smoothly, helping the Nan Gong family would be acceptable. After all, the sooner he finished this task, the sooner he could return.

“Alright, Master, you go back. I’m leaving now.” After saying this, Su Nantian waved goodbye to Nan Gong Ping and headed toward the Nan Gong family’s garage.

Indeed, Su Nantian found his car in the far corner of the Nan Gong family’s garage. Upon looking, it was clearly the worst car in the garage. Moreover, it was covered with dust and looked as if no one had driven it for a long time.

However, upon starting the car, Su Nantian found that the fuel was full—someone had added it recently.

Thus, Su Nantian followed the instructions on the note and used his phone’s navigation to reach the location, then drove there.

The address indicated on the note was in a remote area of Jingdu. And indeed, this place was notorious for being chaotic.

In fact, the major families also had their businesses here, but not for profit. It was merely symbolic to extend their influence. No one truly expected to operate here.

Thus, Zeng Chao’s decision for Su Nantian to go there was clearly to trouble him. From Nan Gong Lin’s perspective, he didn’t expect Su Nantian to achieve anything.

But Su Nantian had no knowledge of the Nan Gong family’s presence there or what business they were conducting. If he waited until arriving to investigate, it would be too late. Thus, after leaving the Nan Gong family’s premises, Su Nantian immediately called another phone.

After a few rings, the call was answered.

“Hello, Su Nantian. How have you been? Did you achieve your goal at the Wu family’s banquet?”

The person on the phone was very familiar to Su Nantian—Song Lichen. However, Song Lichen hadn’t attended the banquet and didn’t know if Su Nantian had achieved his goal.

“Plans have changed slightly; it deviated from my original plan, so I didn’t achieve what I initially wanted. By the way, don’t talk about that now. Can you tell me what business your family is doing in Ruohai District? Or do you know what the Nan Gong family has set up there?”

Su Nantian immediately shifted the topic back to the main issue. This was what he most wanted to know; only after understanding it could he avoid being caught off guard.

“Ruohai District? What are you doing in Ruohai District? Ruohai District has no value for you. For other families, it’s also a place they’ve given up on. You won’t get what you want there,” Song Lichen frowned upon hearing Su Nantian mention this place and said.

“I don’t want to go there, but I’ve offended someone in the Nan Gong family and was exiled here. I need to go to Ruohai District to help them solve the problem. But I know nothing about your side, so I’m asking you if there are any resources on Ruohai District. Please tell me beforehand so I don’t get caught off guard when I arrive.”

Su Nantian smiled helplessly while driving. It seemed Ruohai District was truly a place with no value, even Song Lichen said it had no worth. Thus, this place truly had little value.

Yet Su Nantian was also surprised; he hadn’t expected such an area to exist in Jingdu. Although he knew that not every district in Jingdu was extremely developed, at least the level should be better than surrounding areas or relatively balanced. Yet he hadn’t expected such a place to exist in this bustling city.

“Give me a moment, I can’t find the resources for Ruohai District right now. Just wait a bit; I’ll check it for you quickly,” Song Lichen said and hung up the phone, probably immediately searching for Su Nantian’s information on Ruohai District.

Su Nantian couldn’t help but laugh. He hadn’t expected Song Lichen to need to look up the resources for this district, which made him wonder what kind of den of vipers this place truly was—so much so that even the major families had no control over it.

But the more such places there were, the more challenging they became for Su Nantian. It sparked his curiosity even more.

Chapter 515: Blocking the Road

It was undeniable that Song Lichen’s speed was fast. Within minutes, Su Nantian received a complete file on Ruohai District on his phone.

Su Nantian immediately pulled over the car and looked through the information on his phone, gaining a general understanding of Ruohai District.

This district was considered quite peculiar within Jingdu. It was不受任何人的管制, and even the patrols had no authority there. It was a self-governed area where everything relied on brute force, and only those with strength had authority.

“Simple and brutal. I like it. Maybe this place is quite suitable for me,” Su Nantian smiled after reading the information. If it was indeed about brute force, he might be able to thrive there.

Continuing to read, Su Nantian found that Ruohai District had a group called the Sea King Gang. This group was likely the local triad, and even ordinary people couldn’t handle them. Thus, they were tolerated as long as the Sea King Gang didn’t harm the public.

However, the Sea King Gang wouldn’t stay confined to Ruohai District. Their influence was spreading outward, but usually in secret.

They didn’t have major conflicts with the patrols, so they had maintained a peaceful coexistence. They were also content, stopping once they earned enough money and never causing major disturbances.

But even so, a group like the Sea King Gang ruling an area must have been quite comfortable.

Seeing this, Su Nantian became more puzzled. Why would the major families want to install their own trouble in such a place? This area couldn’t operate normally, so it would be better to abandon it entirely.

However, when Su Nantian continued reading, he finally understood why. It turned out that years ago, the major families had received some help from the Sea King Gang by chance. To maintain their development in Ruohai District, the Sea King Gang had demanded that the major families install part of their business in Ruohai District, providing jobs for some residents.

After all, the Sea King Gang members often engaged in fighting and killing. If someone grew tired of this life or wanted a woman, they couldn’t continue doing it forever. They needed to find legitimate jobs, so they were assigned to the major families’ business locations there.

But over the years, the Sea King Gang had become even more demanding. They no longer worked but instead directly asked the major families for money and even shouted at their staff stationed there.

This was why the Nan Gong family had developed some resentment toward the Sea King Gang, especially since Zeng Chao controlled all security personnel. They had stationed many people in the Sea King Gang’s territory, but they were still frequently harassed. Thus, Zeng Chao had come up with this plan to trouble Su Nantian.

“Finally, I was sent here to clean up this mess. To truly resolve it, one must address the root cause; otherwise, it’s impossible to change completely. Zeng Chao and Zhang Yu must have planned this task for me to fail. These two really have bad intentions.”

Su Nantian said as he put his phone away and restarted the car, heading toward Ruohai District.

But for Su Nantian, he would never give up on his next plan because of this. He definitely wouldn’t wait for Nan Gong Ping to come and rescue him. Thus, he had only one thing to do: truly help the Nan Gong family regain their authority in Ruohai District.

Yet, this kind of task made Su Nantian even more excited. This challenge was long overdue for him.

Especially now, alone and entering a den of wolves, if he succeeded, the sense of accomplishment would be even greater.

Su Nantian drove for about an hour before reaching the edge of Ruohai District. He could clearly feel that the economic development here was much worse than other areas, looking quite desolate and giving a sense of being twenty years behind other regions.

His car had driven for some time when he noticed a group of people gathered on the roadside, sitting and chatting as if they were just having a casual conversation. But each of them had tattoos on their arms or was bald, clearly members of the Sea King Gang.

Before Su Nantian’s car reached them, they all stood up and blocked the road with barriers. They waved their hands to signal Su Nantian to stop.

Su Nantian understood the saying “a strong dragon doesn’t dominate a local snake.” Especially since he had just arrived, he couldn’t afford to clash with them. Thus, he slowed down and stopped the car.

Su Nantian stuck his head out of the window and smiled at them, saying: “Brothers, I just arrived here and don’t know the rules. How can I pass through Ruohai District? What should I do to let you move aside?”

Su Nantian truly felt they were like local emperors, blocking the road just because they could. This vast area was so desolate that it was hard to believe, especially since Ruohai District was within Jingdu. It seemed incredible.

Moreover, Su Nantian had never heard of Ruohai District before. He thought Jingdu would always be as prosperous and economically developed as seen on TV and the internet, a major economic hub nationwide.

It seemed that Ruohai District had been erased from Jingdu’s memory. They appeared to exist only in reality, like a wound that never healed and remained within Jingdu’s territory.

Perhaps because Su Nantian had shown a good attitude, these people smiled at him. One of them approached and said: “What’s up? You just arrived, right? What are you doing in Ruohai District? First report it to us so we can listen. If it’s a legitimate matter, we’ll let you pass; if not, just get out of here.”

Su Nantian immediately said: “Brother, I’m from the Nan Gong family. My master has ordered me to come here and check out our Nan Gong family’s place. Please let me pass.”

Chapter 516: A Disorganized Group

Upon hearing Su Nantian was from the Nan Gong family, these people raised their eyebrows and said: “How can you prove you’re from the Nan Gong family?”

Su Nantian had prepared for this. Before leaving, he had asked Nan Gong Ping for an identity to prove he was from the family.

At that time, Su Nantian had requested this identity merely to prove himself when he arrived at the Nan Gong family’s business in Ruohai District. Since Zeng Chao had only given him an address, if he arrived empty-handed and they didn’t believe him, it would be problematic. But now this identity had come in handy.

Thus, Su Nantian took out a badge from his car—a family emblem of the Nan Gong family. It depicted a golden lion roaring on a blue background.

“Brother, look at this,” Su Nantian said as he waved the badge in his hand.

Upon seeing it, the man nodded and told others: “Yes, he’s definitely from the Nan Gong family.”

“Since he’s from the Nan Gong family, let him pass. We’ll go visit their business there,” the man said and laughed heartily. The others also laughed.

Su Nantian observed these people, realizing they would likely go to the Nan Gong family’s business in Ruohai District soon.

These people laughed and removed the roadblocks, then one of them waved his hand to signal Su Nantian could proceed.

Su Nantian smiled and nodded at them, then drove forward according to the navigation’s route toward the address given by the Nan Gong family.

After arriving at the address on the navigation, Su Nantian found it was merely a three-story office building. Compared to the Nan Gong family’s own properties, it was vastly different—almost making one doubt that such a place could be part of the Nan Gong family.

After all, even the worst car in the Nan Gong family’s garage was worth about 400,000 yuan. This building might be worth only two cars.

Indeed, Ruohai District had no value at all. Thus, real estate there was worthless and no one would buy houses to settle here.

Instead, Ruohai District had become an area with extremely low housing prices in Jingdu. Some houses were even empty, but even if they were given for free to people from Jingdu, they wouldn’t dare live there.

Su Nantian parked his car and entered the building. Upon entering, he found it was completely empty. It seemed to be open for business, and there were no signs of dust—evidently someone cleaned it regularly. Moreover, a cup of steaming tea was on the table.

“Is anyone here?” Su Nantian shouted into the building.

After shouting, no one responded. Thus, he shouted again: “Is anyone here?”

Finally, after several shouts, someone’s footsteps came down from upstairs. The person was muttering: “Who is it? Who is it? Who has time to come here? It’s like encountering a ghost. No one came today, but who is it?”

A security guard-like person descended from the upper floor. He was still wearing his jacket and had a sleepy look, as if he had been resting upstairs.

Upon seeing Su Nantian, this person was surprised and asked: “Who are you? I haven’t seen you before. Are you new?”

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian knew his assumption was correct—Zeng Chao had sent him here without informing the people there. Thus, they didn’t know he was coming today or that the Nan Gong family would send someone to help them resolve this issue.

Thus, it demonstrated how wise Su Nantian had been in asking Nan Gong Ping for proof of his identity as a member of the Nan Gong family. Thus, Su Nantian took out the badge again and waved it: “Do you recognize this?”

The person obviously recognized the Nan Gong family’s emblem. Thus, his attitude immediately softened and he smiled: “You’re from the Nan Gong family? What are you doing here?”

“Zeng Chao sent me. He said your place has some problems and is often bullied by people, so he asked me to come check it out.”

After Su Nantian said this, the person’s expression immediately changed. Earlier, he had shown some respect for Su Nantian, thinking he was from the Nan Gong family’s headquarters. But upon hearing this, he thought this person must have been sent by Zeng Chao.

However, the person still smiled and said: “Please sit. We’re on break now, so no one is up yet. I’ll go upstairs to call them down.”

After saying this, the person immediately climbed back up the stairs. Su Nantian noticed it was already 11 a.m., yet these people hadn’t gotten up. It showed how idle they were in Ruohai District.

But this person returned to the third-floor dormitory and also woke up others. One by one, they grumbled: “Who is it outside making noise? Why are you disturbing us so early in the morning?”

Before this person could answer, another immediately sat up: “It’s not that the Sea King Gang has come, right? I thought it was about time.”

This person spoke and others immediately sat up. For them, the Sea King Gang was like a nightmare. If it were indeed the Sea King Gang coming, they would be beaten if they delayed.

“Alright, don’t scare yourselves. It must be someone sent by Zeng Chao,” this person said with a dismissive expression.

“Someone from the Nan Gong family? We should treat him well,” another person said.

“What are you talking about? I think this person must have offended Zeng Chao and was sent here. You didn’t see his appearance; he looks like a fool. We don’t need to give him any respect. After all, we’ve suffered so much here; why should we treat him kindly?”

“You’re right. Let’s call Zeng Chao and ask what this is about. If he really is from the Nan Gong family, we’ll treat him well. But if he was sent by Zeng Chao, we can teach him a lesson.”

Chapter 517: Little Brother

Clearly, these people were cowards who feared the strong but took advantage of the weak. If Su Nantian was from the Nan Gong family, they couldn’t afford to offend him. But if he had been sent by Zeng Chao, it meant Su Nantian wasn’t doing well in the Nan Gong family and had offended someone. Thus, they wouldn’t hold back on him.

After all, these people in Ruohai District had suffered much. Now that a new person had arrived, they could take the chance to bully him a little. They certainly wouldn’t hold back.
