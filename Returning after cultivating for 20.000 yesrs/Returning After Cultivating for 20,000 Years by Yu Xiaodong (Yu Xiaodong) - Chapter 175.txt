"Once this idea surfaced, Captain Qiu acted swiftly, immediately setting about subduing Su Nantian.

He thought he absolutely could not be intimidated by Su Nantian's movements, even if Su Nantian could clearly track the short man's presence.

But what did it matter? He wasn't employing their techniques or methods.

It was the perfect opportunity to strike while Ye Tengyilang distracted Su Nantian. That way, he could severely chastise Su Nantian.

With this thought, Captain Qiu's expression grew even more resolute.

Moreover, Captain Qiu felt he absolutely could not be intimidated by Su Nantian so easily. He clenched his fists again, gritted his teeth, and then rushed toward Su Nantian with a determined attack: “You little brat! Don’t think you can act so boldly!”

Since he had been chosen by the Xu family before, and his remarkable abilities had caught others' attention, he would not allow himself to be defeated by Su Nantian.

He would definitely win today!

Captain Qiu told himself this in his heart, and his expression was resolute.

He charged at Su Nantian with bare fists, yet for some reason, his fingers seemed to transform into impossibly hard weapons. His feet were no different—wherever he stepped, deep pits formed instantly, an ability beyond ordinary humans.

Su Nantian, upon witnessing this technique, did not show any surprise. Instead, he asked with interest: “Oh, so you're not an ordinary person either?”

Su Nantian said this out of genuine sentiment. He had long heard that there were indeed extraordinary individuals in the world, but he had never had the chance to meet them. Now, he found one within the Xu family—truly a fortunate coincidence.

Seeing Captain Qiu's abilities, Su Nantian displayed even more curiosity.

Captain Qiu had expected that revealing his powers would shock or frighten Su Nantian, but instead, the latter remained completely calm. This reaction was entirely unlike what Captain Qiu had anticipated, leaving him thoroughly frustrated.

Moreover, Su Nantian's comment about him being "not an ordinary person" made Captain Qiu extremely annoyed, as if he had become the subject of a sideshow and Su Nantian was the audience.

The more he thought about it, the deeper his resentment toward Su Nantian grew. He clenched his fists again and rushed at Su Nantian, thinking him utterly despicable.

Chapter 874: Hidden Weapons

This time, his attack was incredibly fast—his strength and speed were astonishing. His fists created gusts of wind as they moved.

Such techniques were beyond ordinary humans, yet Su Nantian handled them effortlessly without ever being struck.

Captain Qiu's expression turned anxious as he saw Su Nantian's prowess. His speed far exceeded that of ordinary humans, and no one could intercept his attacks before they landed.

Yet Su Nantian seemed to have countless eyes, or perhaps his movements appeared slowed down in Captain Qiu's perception. He launched a series of rapid punches, but none landed on Su Nantian.

"Damn it!" Captain Qiu cursed again, his expression darkening. He then wore a sinister look.

His fists suddenly spread apart, and between his fingers appeared countless flying needles.

An ordinary person would be distracted by these terrifying hidden weapons or unable to block them all.

But Su Nantian was no ordinary person. To him, Captain Qiu's move was merely despicable. He raised his hand slightly to create an air barrier, intercepting all the poisoned needles.

In this back-and-forth exchange, Captain Qiu was exhausted, while Su Nantian remained completely composed, his hair untouched. It seemed as if he were strolling leisurely rather than fighting.

The more composed Su Nantian was, the more frustrated Captain Qiu felt, as if he had been tricked by Su Nantian.

How could there be such a powerful person in this world? Captain Qiu was deeply dissatisfied.

When he first discovered his special ability, Captain Qiu had been thrilled. He had also undergone specialized training. For years, he had never encountered an opponent—until now, when he met Su Nantian.

"Ye Tengyilang!" Captain Qiu shouted, calling out the short man's name and issuing orders: "Quick! Attack! Let's surround him together!"

They could not give up so easily. Even if Su Nantian's abilities exceeded his expectations, for the sake of protecting their master and preserving their dignity, they had to win this battle tonight—only victory was acceptable.

The short man heard Captain Qiu's command and immediately concealed his presence again. He had just been disarmed by Su Nantian, and now he was seething with anger, desperate to eliminate Su Nantian.

Upon hearing Captain Qiu's words, he immediately cooperated. This time, he not only concealed his presence but also launched hidden weapons, preparing to chastise Su Nantian with a full-scale attack. They surrounded him completely, leaving no openings.

Yet Su Nantian showed no fear or panic. He simply smiled and created another air barrier, clearly detecting the short man's movements while intercepting all the hidden weapons mid-air.

Captain Qiu and the short man were stunned, staring at their intercepted weapons. They had used nearly all of their hidden weapons—how could none have reached Su Nantian?

These weapons were laced with deadly poison, capable of killing instantly upon contact. That was why they had decided to attack together, launching these poisoned hidden weapons to kill Su Nantian.

Yet their weapons had not even touched Su Nantian, which was both infuriating and bewildering.

"Are you not called masters? When did masters resort to such underhanded methods?"

Poison and hidden weapons were the lowest forms of treachery, used only by third-rate assassins with no scruples. True masters would never resort to such methods.

Su Nantian said this out of disdain, his gaze filled with contempt for them.

These people were truly unworthy of their self-proclaimed reputation.

But then again, if they called themselves masters, it didn't necessarily mean they were truly worthy of the title.

"You!"

Captain Qiu and the short man, upon hearing Su Nantian's remarks, exchanged glances, their expressions darkening further. If it weren't for Su Nantian's abilities, they would have rushed to attack him immediately.

But their previous fight had made it clear that neither of them could match Su Nantian. Thus, they could only glare in anger without daring to act rashly.

"Are you giving up?"

Su Nantian asked, pausing before continuing: "If you take me to see Old Lady Xu, I won't mind letting you go."

Su Nantian said this while watching them calmly.

These two men had no grudge against him. If they stopped pressing, Su Nantian would not kill them.

That was why he had offered them a chance, and it was his genuine intention.

However, Su Nantian did not know that these people were proud and, upon hearing his tone, felt he was belittling them. Their faces burned with indignation and refused to accept his mercy.

Su Nantian's words made Captain Qiu and the short man feel that Su Nantian assumed they had no choice but to beg for mercy, which made them even more upset.

In this tense standoff, the short man concealed his presence again.

Su Nantian, seeing him refuse to back down and challenge him, sighed in无奈.

He looked coldly at Captain Qiu and the short man: "I've given you a chance. You just didn't cherish it."

He always kept his word. If they had taken him to see Old Lady Xu earlier, Su Nantian would have kept his promise and not killed them.

"Since this is your choice, then so be it."

Chapter 875: Threat

The short man's actions had already been decided. They still needed to continue their resistance.

Their eyes clearly showed they were determined to be enemies with Su Nantian.

In that case, Su Nantian would comply. Soon, they would realize how wrong their choice was.

"I can see you. Don't bother trying,"

Su Nantian sneered again, saying this while looking at them with contempt.

He could clearly detect the short man's movements. Though he couldn't see his form, as long as he was in the air, Su Nantian could sense their distance. Thus, they were completely exposed to him.

"Haha, do you think my target is you? I've already suffered a loss against you. Naturally, I won't go after you again!"

The short man suddenly appeared, sneering and saying this arrogantly. After speaking, he pushed someone in front of him.

"See? Haha! You were careless! Don't blame me!"

The short man sneered again, as if he had a leverage to control Su Nantian.

It turned out that Old Master Hong was his target. The short man had grabbed Hongye's neck, attempting to threaten Su Nantian.

He used this action to choke Hongye's neck and stared coldly at Su Nantian, thinking he would be intimidated into not acting recklessly.

"Don't! Don't kill me. I'm just a guide, and I'm not with him!"

Hongye, captured by them, immediately pleaded. He hadn't expected to become their target.

He truly had no idea why he was caught in this mess!

If only he hadn't gotten involved with this matter. He should have waited for the right moment, relying on Su Nantian's strength to eliminate the Xu family. Then he could have taken a share of the spoils!

Instead, he had become prey.

"Silence!"

The short man, finally having a leverage, glared at Hongye upon hearing his words. No matter what Hongye said, the short man would not let go of him. He still intended to use Hongye to warn Su Nantian, so he wouldn't easily let him go.

Hongye was accompanying Su Nantian, so the short man believed Hongye was deliberately misleading him.

Hongye had already seen their strength and knew he was helpless against the three of them.

Upon hearing the short man's warning and seeing his murderous gaze, he immediately obeyed, remaining silent without making a sound.

Moreover, Hongye could only place all his hopes on Su Nantian now. He hoped they would think he still had some value and save him.

"You stop right now, or we'll attack your companion!"

The short man finally warned Su Nantian: "I'm not joking!"

He seemed to believe they had found a leverage against Su Nantian. After saying this, he tightened his grip on Hongye's neck, demonstrating the action to Su Nantian.

He was telling Su Nantian he meant business.

Upon hearing the short man's words, Hongye closed his eyes and prepared for death.

Indeed, upon hearing this, Su Nantian sneered: "Then go ahead and kill him. I was planning to kill him after this anyway. Since you're doing it, thank you."

Su Nantian's words were light and indifferent, making it hard to discern their truth.

His expression had always been so detached, as if nothing could truly catch his attention.

Upon hearing Su Nantian's words and seeing him appear indifferent to Hongye, the short man's expression changed: "You really don't care about your companion's life?"

At this, the short man tightened his grip on Hongye's neck, using his pain to warn Su Nantian.

He was unwilling and felt it was a waste of effort, thinking he had planned so much to lure Su Nantian into this trap. Yet the latter remained indifferent.

The short man had essentially wasted his effort and was therefore upset.

Captain Qiu also added: "This is your last chance. If you don't stop, we'll kill your companion!"

They could not believe that Hongye was with Su Nantian and they weren't allies.

Even if Hongye wasn't important, they had no leverage against Su Nantian now.

So they could only continue to use Hongye as a threat, hoping for a miracle.

They had now become desperate and relied on Hongye as their last hope.

Hongye, however, kept his eyes closed. He had already realized he had no chance of survival.

"I said, whether you act or not is up to you."

Su Nantian simply smiled and his expression was very playful. He showed no pretense, truly not caring about Hongye's life.

Moreover, Su Nantian's previous words were no lie. He had indeed planned to kill Hongye after finding Old Lady Xu, to avoid any lingering problems.

So now, having them do it for him was a great convenience.

Only these two were so foolish to try threatening him with Hongye.

After thinking this through, Su Nantian's expression became even more playful. Seeing his meaningful smile and hearing these words that showed no concern for Hongye, Captain Qiu and the short man were instantly unsure of what to do.

They exchanged glances, their doubts deepening.

Had they made a mistake?

Was Hongye also forced to come with Su Nantian, so using him as leverage had no effect?

At this moment, the Xu family in the surveillance room were also confused and couldn't figure out Su Nantian's relationship with Hongye.

Old Lady Xu furrowed her brows, pondering their relationship. If Hongye's words were true, then all the strange behavior they had seen earlier would make sense.

Old Lady Xu had previously thought Hongye was always afraid of Su Nantian, completely submitting to him.

Chapter 876: Wrong Person

Now it seemed that because of this relationship, Hongye was so afraid of Su Nantian.

Xu Hai and Xu Tian didn't think about these things but quickly reminded Old Lady Xu: "Mother, it seems these two can't hold out much longer. We should leave quickly before this young man enters."

Their expressions were also tense, as they felt Su Nantian's power was immense and exceeded their expectations. He wasn't the person they had initially thought could be easily dealt with.

If they delayed any longer, who knew if they would escape from the Xu family?

"No, we're going out."

At this moment, Old Lady Xu made a decision that left the two of them unable to understand and shocked them.

"He said he wanted to meet me, but I don't know him or his background. If that's the case, then let's meet and see what he has to say."

Old Lady Xu's expression was resolute, clearly indicating this decision wasn't a joke.

"Mother! This is absolutely not allowed! It's too dangerous. You've seen his abilities, please reconsider!"

Xu Hai and Xu Tian immediately opposed Old Lady Xu's decision, not agreeing with it. They also felt Su Nantian was extremely dangerous.

If he had come to kill Old Lady Xu, they would have no chance of resistance.

"What do you think we can run to? If this threat isn't resolved, he'll surely follow us around the Xu family in the future."

Old Lady Xu looked seriously at her two sons and said.

"How long do you think his abilities will take?"

At this point, Old Lady Xu's face became more solemn.

This was her greatest concern.

Old Lady Xu's words weren't exaggerated, but they had all seen Su Nantian's abilities. They knew if he truly wanted to find the Xu family, they would be caught in no time.

So why go through all this trouble to escape?

Moreover, Old Lady Xu had a new idea at that moment. She didn't yet know the young man was Su Nantian, but she had seen his infinite power and strong potential.

"What if we could turn him to our side? What kind of situation would the Xu family be in?"

At this point, Old Lady Xu's expression was more meaningful.

"What if we had his help, would we still need to be limited to just M City?"

Although their status was already very high and they could have authority here, even many powerful people would make way for them. But this was nothing to Old Lady Xu's ambitious nature.

Moreover, water flows downhill and people strive upward. If there was an opportunity to go higher, Old Lady Xu would definitely seize it.

If Old Lady Xu had grown old and her ambitions had gradually diminished, it was because she lacked the ability at that time. Now, seeing Su Nantian, her extinguished ambitions reignited.

She felt if Su Nantian was used properly, the Xu family could achieve even greater glory than their ancestors had.

After thinking this through, Old Lady Xu immediately stood up and became excited. If everything went as she had planned, this would indeed be a good choice.

Unfortunately, they were facing Su Nantian, not an ordinary person. So they had already been on the opposing side from the start and there was no way for mutual assistance. Su Nantian would never be swayed by them.

Moreover, this path was destined to be a dead end!

"Mother, it's not allowed... This is too risky!"

Xu Hai looked devastated when he heard Old Lady Xu's words, not expecting her to choose such a risky approach.

Her idea was quite good, even making Xu Hai consider it. However, Xu Hai knew better—Su Nantian had entered openly today, not with the intention of playing around but seriously.

Although he didn't know Su Nantian's purpose, Xu Hai still felt this young man was extremely dangerous, beyond their expectations and control.

Moreover, they had no leverage to restrain Su Nantian. This negotiation was destined to fail.

"Yes! Mother, Brother said it right. It's too risky!"

Xu Tian also strongly disagreed.

Su Nantian was a dangerous person. If they cooperated with him, it would be like making a deal with a tiger. No one knew when this tiger might become angry!

So Xu Tian, like his brother, believed in fleeing quickly and returning later to deal with this strange young man.

"Risk?"

Old Lady Xu sneered: "If it weren't for the risk, how could there be such a big reward?"

If they were afraid of even a little risk, then they would have wasted the Xu family's bloodline.

"I've made up my mind."

Old Lady Xu said this while making her decision, ignoring anyone's advice.

Seeing them try to persuade her, Old Lady Xu spoke first: "If you're afraid, you can leave first."

Old Lady Xu looked determined not to change her mind.

She had made up her mind to take this gamble!

Although losing might mean total defeat and even death, if she won, it would bring considerable benefits.

This gamble was one she had decided on.

While the Xu family were talking, Su Nantian had already planned to deal with Captain Qiu and the short man.

They knew Hongye posed no threat to them, yet they still used him to intimidate Su Nantian. They had done this repeatedly.

Su Nantian's patience was exhausted, and he no longer wanted to play with them.

"Hmph! I didn't expect you to be so ruthless at such a young age!"

Captain Qiu hadn't expected Hongye's card to fail, feeling both irritated and dissatisfied.

He sneered and mocked Su Nantian, calling him a person who sacrificed his companions.

"You've talked too much,"

Su Nantian sneered and prepared to deal with them.

Chapter 877: Eliminating the Two

As for Hongye, who was under their control, Su Nantian didn't care at all.

"Don't come any closer! If you take another step, I'll kill him!"

The short man controlled Hongye and warned Su Nantian who was approaching them.

Unfortunately, Su Nantian ignored him completely, not taking his threat seriously.

The short man, seeing this, became furious and actually snapped Hongye's neck.

Poor Hongye didn't even have time to let out a groan before becoming a pawn in their fight, dying pitifully.

"Hmph. I should thank you for getting rid of a troublemaker."

Su Nantian sneered and thanked them, but his words were cold and it was unclear if they were genuine.

Upon hearing Su Nantian's words, Captain Qiu and the short man exchanged glances and felt even more angry, as if they had been tricked by Su Nantian.

They looked at each other and nodded, preparing to teach Su Nantian a lesson. They would attack together, trying to coordinate and kill Su Nantian.

Moreover, they continued to release the poisoned needles they carried, trying to use these underhanded methods to kill Su Nantian. Unfortunately, their schemes failed and only made Su Nantian laugh.

Su Nantian looked down on them even more.

"Did you only have this trick? Besides backstabbing, do you have no other methods?"

Su Nantian said coldly and then waved his hand to block all the poisoned needles they had shot at him.

Captain Qiu and the short man were shocked by this scene, instinctively trying to dodge.

But for some reason, a barrier of air appeared around them—invisible and intangible but capable of trapping them within.

They seemed to be locked in a square grid, no matter how they struggled or moved their bodies, they couldn't escape this space.

At that moment, both of them stared wide-eyed at the front. They saw their poisoned needles returning along the same path, directly piercing into their bodies.

These were all specially refined and processed poisons, extremely deadly and effective. They could kill instantly upon contact with the skin.

As soon as they touched their skin, Captain Qiu and the short man stared wide-eyed. They didn't even have time to say a word before dying instantly.

"Hmph, truly pitiful."

Su Nantian waved his hand and sneered, looking at the two corpses on the ground and their greenish faces from poisoning. He commented.

They both deserved their fate, dying by their own treachery. Su Nantian was merely acting in self-defense.

"Now that these troublemakers are eliminated, it's time to meet Old Lady Xu."

Su Nantian smiled playfully, his lips curling and eyes cold.

Since they didn't want to take him to see Old Lady Xu, Su Nantian would have to find her himself.

"Who are you? Why have you come to my Xu family at this time, and what do you want with me?"

Old Lady Xu now walked toward Su Nantian with her cane. She had been convincing her two sons and was determined not to change her mind.

Old Lady Xu also said that if they didn't agree with her, they could leave first.

But Xu Tian and Xu Hai would never abandon their mother and leave her behind. So they hesitated but followed Old Lady Xu out.

They held a hope that, given Old Lady Xu's long-standing dominance in M City and her constant rise and fall but still remaining at the top, she might indeed have special methods.

Moreover, they had carefully observed Su Nantian's abilities and truly felt that if they could recruit him as their subordinate, it would be much better than the many expensive people they had previously hired.

One person could deal with so many of them.

Old Lady Xu slowly approached Su Nantian and spoke.

Upon seeing their appearance, Su Nantian raised his eyebrows in surprise and thought. It was better that they had come out themselves, saving him the trouble of searching for them.

"Who are you? You don't know?"

Upon hearing Old Lady Xu's question, Su Nantian felt a bit of doubt. Why did they seem to not know him?

"Your abilities are remarkable, and you're a young talent. Truly, heroes emerge at a young age."

Old Lady Xu smiled politely and praised Su Nantian: "Perhaps Old Lady Xu has been secluded in this small city of M and hasn't heard of you."

Old Lady Xu's words were skillfully phrased, complimenting Su Nantian while also trying to probe his identity and wait for him to reveal it.

Xu Hai and Xu Tian looked at Su Nantian respectfully, having seen his abilities. They dared not confront him directly.

"Haha."

Upon hearing their words and seeing the respectful expressions on their faces, Su Nantian felt it was quite amusing: "If you don't know me, why go to such lengths to send people to find me?"

But his doubts grew more. If they had never met him, why would they come looking for him?

"Looking for you?"

Old Lady Xu had anticipated many answers from Su Nantian, but she never expected this one. Her face showed a moment of confusion and then carefully examined Su Nantian, as if thinking about something. Suddenly, she widened her eyes and stared at him.

"Is it possible that you are Su Nantian?"

Upon saying this guess, Old Lady Xu's expression became even more surprised.

Had they been going around in circles and Su Nantian had finally come to them?

If it were before, Old Lady Xu would have been happy. But now that they knew Su Nantian's abilities, who could laugh?

"Yes, I am Su Nantian. The person you're looking for."

Su Nantian smiled: "I'm here in front of you now. You can tell me what it is that you want with me."

Su Nantian didn't miss Old Lady Xu's expressions.

He had been quietly observing them during the conversation, trying to find a crack in their faces.

Upon hearing Su Nantian's answer, Old Lady Xu was shocked and almost dropped her cane.

Chapter 878: Justification for the Resolution

"You... you are Su Nantian!"

At this moment, even Old Lady Xu stammered and couldn't speak clearly.

If she had felt happy when seeing Su Nantian's abilities before, now her heart was cold.

She had made a mistake!

Su Nantian killed Wu Chuan, which is why they had gone to such lengths to find him. If Su Nantian knew they wanted to eliminate him, then they would only have a path to death.

"What? I'm here in front of you now, but you still won't say it?"

Su Nantian raised his eyebrows again, feeling quite perfect. At the same time, his doubts grew more.

He didn't know what identity he had or what grudge he had with them, but why would they go to such lengths to find him? And after hearing his true identity, they showed such fear.

All of this indicated that the relationship between Old Lady Xu and himself was definitely not ordinary.

Although Su Nantian wanted to find out his identity, he wasn't foolish enough to expose his weaknesses or admit that he had amnesia.

So at this moment, Su Nantian was watching them and looking for cracks in their faces to gradually obtain information about his identity through indirect questioning.

"You..."

Old Lady Xu was at a loss for words, unsure of what to say to Su Nantian.

At this moment, seeing Su Nantian and thinking about his strength, Old Lady Xu was also shocked. She should have guessed it before. They had seen the video before, although the young man in front of her looked different from the one on the surveillance footage. However, their abilities were almost identical.

Moreover, Su Nantian had defeated all of Wu Chuan's security personnel with his own strength and killed Wu Chuan.

From these circumstances, Su Nantian was definitely not an ordinary person. Old Lady Xu hadn't expected that her ambition had caused such a big consequence. If she had known, she would have run away without hesitation.

"You forgot? You killed Wu Chuan. He was the enemy we've been tracking, and you killed him for us, solving a major problem."

Xu Hai stepped forward then, his expression very determined. He spoke in a way that twisted the truth.

At this moment, Xu Hai was also gambling. Their relationship with Wu Chuan was very secret; except for those close to them, almost no one knew about Xu Xiangning and Wu Chuan's mother-son relationship.

He was now gambling, guessing that Su Nantian wouldn't know about their relationship.

"Because you solved this problem for us, we wanted to invite you over and recruit you into our Xu family."

After coming up with this excuse, Xu Hai naturally continued to push forward and stepped closer to Su Nantian: "Don't worry, if you join our Xu family, we will give you unlimited benefits—things you can't imagine."

"Indeed, your abilities have impressed us. That's why we went to such lengths to find you."

Xu Tian understood his brother's intention at this moment and echoed him, knowing that if there was any inconsistency now, it would be noticed by Su Nantian. This was their key to survival.

"Because of this reason?"

Su Nantian looked at them with confusion, thinking quickly in his mind.

What Wu Chuan? When had he injured this Wu Chuan?

At this point, Su Nantian couldn't figure out what relationship he had with Zheng Wu Chuan. Why had he killed him, and why had he lost his memory?

However, Su Nantian didn't show it now. He watched them: "What grudge do you have with Wu Chuan? Tell me."

Although he couldn't remember these things, he knew that the expressions of Old Lady Xu and the two men were problematic.
