“Sir,” said Wu Chuan’s assistant, stepping forward with a smile. “Please inform your master that the Wu family has arrived and wishes to conduct a search. Let him know we’re here, and see if he’ll grant us entry.”

Wu Chuan’s assistant feared that if Wu Chuan lost his temper and acted rashly, it would offend the Wang family. That would create a lasting enmity between the Wu and Wang families.

The security guard pondered for a moment before nodding. “Fine, I’ll go inform him. But you lot stay here—don’t move forward a single step.”

Before leaving, the guard instructed his companions: “You four keep watch here. Don’t let anyone in until I return. If anyone dares to let them through, be careful.”

After the guard departed, Wu Chuan could no longer contain his anger. “What’s going on? How dare they do this on our turf? I’ve truly seen the extent of their arrogance.”

Su Nantian understood Wu Chuan’s frustration. To be obstructed on one’s own land, with no recourse to retaliate—such a situation was infuriating. He also realized the Wang family’s power, as they dared to act so boldly.

After a while, the security guard returned. But instead of immediately reporting the result, he bowed deeply to Wu Chuan and struck himself across the face twice. The slaps landed with a resounding thud, leaving red marks on his cheek.

Su Nantian was stunned. The guard’s self-inflicted punishment was brutal, and the room fell silent as everyone stared in disbelief.

The guard then spoke: “My apologies, Mr. Wu. I was impolite and disrespectful. I now take responsibility for my actions. Our master has agreed to let you conduct your search. Please proceed.”

He then led Wu Chuan into the room with great deference. Wu Chuan felt his anger smoldering like a bomb that had failed to explode—his frustration was unbearable, yet he could find no outlet.

Su Nantian observed the scene and mused that the Wang family had not only deployed guards but also a formidable figure. Otherwise, the Wang heir would never have issued such an order.

As Su Nantian and Wu Chuan entered the Wang heir’s room, they found an unfamiliar man seated there. Though Wu Chuan clearly recognized him, he smiled and said: “Ah! I see now—this entire group was led by Master Wang himself.”

Su Nantian deduced the man’s identity. According to information from Song Lichen, Master Wang was a figure of both talent and refinement.

The man smiled and addressed Wu Chuan: “I had my men apologize to you. I hope it was satisfactory. They lack manners, thinking they’re still within the Wang estate. Their attitude was inappropriate, so I had them personally apologize to you. Naturally, we extend our apologies on behalf of the Wang family.”

Wu Chuan was taken aback. He now understood why the guard had apologized and struck himself—Master Wang had ordered it.

Though Wu Chuan was displeased, he knew he must swallow his anger. After all, the Wang family had already apologized. To refuse their apology would make him appear petty.

Su Nantian, however, could not help but smirk. Master Wang was a master of manipulation, turning Wu Chuan’s anger into frustration without even lifting a finger.

The Wang heir remained seated on the sofa, never once rising to greet Wu Chuan. This was his usual behavior since arriving at the Wu estate, having humiliated Wu Chuan twice before. Now, he maintained his aloofness as if nothing had changed.

Wu Chuan endured the slight but could do little more than feign understanding. He knew he was at a disadvantage; to confront the Wang heir would only invite retaliation. After all, the Wang heir was their family’s sole heir and future patriarch. If Wu Chuan offended him now, he would surely face retribution when the Wang heir took control.

Thus, Wu Chuan feigned indifference to the Wang heir’s disdain and focused instead on speaking with Master Wang. The Wang heir was merely a figurehead now, as the search would be conducted under Master Wang’s guidance.

“We’ve arrived to investigate the four assassins who harmed Nan Gong Ping. We need your cooperation in thoroughly searching this place to ensure no one is hiding here.”

Wu Chuan finally addressed the matter at hand. His mission was not to outwit the Wang family but to locate the assassins.

The Wang master nodded, but the heir suddenly raised his head and asked: “Are you suspecting these assassins are from our family?”

Wu Chuan hesitated before replying: “Of course not. This is merely routine procedure. We’ll investigate all families, including our own Wu family, to ensure no one slipped through unnoticed. I hope you’ll understand.”

Wu Chuan’s tone was conciliatory, knowing the Wang heir had repeatedly challenged him. Though he disliked the heir’s attitude, he dared not provoke them.

“Then if you don’t suspect us, there’s no need to search. I can assure you, no one is hiding here. Our guards have already searched the premises thoroughly and found nothing suspicious. You may leave now, saving yourselves time and effort.”

The Wang heir still refused to look at Wu Chuan, speaking from his seated position.

Su Nantian nearly laughed aloud but restrained himself. The Wang heir was truly Wu Chuan’s nemesis, having openly defied him before.

“Not quite appropriate,” Wu Chuan replied. “A thorough search is for your safety, not suspicion. I’ve already mentioned some areas only the Wu family knows about. Your guards may have missed them. A complete search would better ensure your safety. I don’t want another incident like Nan Gong Ping’s.”

Wu Chuan smiled, suppressing his anger.

At this, Master Wang interjected: “Indeed, let the Wu family conduct the search. It won’t harm us. You need only sit here.”

Master Wang was reasonable, understanding that even with their power, they should avoid offending other families.

The Wang heir, who had previously been arrogant, now seemed to fear Master Wang. His haughty demeanor vanished instantly.

The heir nodded and said: “Fine, if you’ve agreed, I won’t interfere. Let them finish quickly.”

Afterward, the heir returned to his phone, ignoring everyone else.

Su Nantian nodded in understanding. The Wang family’s internal power dynamics were indeed complex. Though it seemed the heir would inherit, his authority was not as absolute as it appeared.

Master Wang’s power must be far greater than he seemed. Moreover, Wu Chuan and Master Wang treated each other as equals, not master and servant.

After obtaining Master Wang’s approval, Wu Chuan signaled his guards to begin the search. Some searched the rooms while others checked the entire floor, focusing on ventilation shafts as per Su Nantian’s theory.

Su Nantian followed the guards to inspect the Wang family’s room. However, as he had predicted, no one was found—no traces of the assassins.

Su Nantian believed the assassins were still within the estate, and they must belong to one of the major families. Yet after searching all but the Huang family, no evidence was found.

The Huang family was affiliated with the Nan Gong family. It would be foolish for them to betray their patron, as they still relied on Nan Gong’s protection.

Moreover, the alliance between Huang and Nan Gong balanced other families. For them, this was the best arrangement.

The guards reported back to Wu Chuan: “Sir, we’ve searched thoroughly. No signs of the assassins. Nothing at all.”

Wu Chuan exhaled sharply. He didn’t believe the assassins were from the Wang family, but after searching several families without success, it was suspicious.

Still, they couldn’t linger and provoke the Wang family. Wu Chuan nodded: “Since we’ve finished, let’s leave quickly. We have more places to search.”

The guards obeyed and prepared to depart.

As Wu Chuan was about to say goodbye to the Wang family, Master Wang called him back. “What’s on your mind, Master Wang?” Wu Chuan smiled.

“Perhaps we can discuss other matters. For instance, the upcoming heir election.” Master Wang smiled.

Wu Chuan hesitated before returning. This matter was crucial, as Song Yuyan had said that if he found the assassins within hours, Nan Gong might change their vote. His plan to control the Wu family through Wu You’er would fail.

Wu Chuan returned, smiling: “What do you mean, Master Wang? Please clarify.”

But as he spoke, Wu Chuan remembered the Nan Gong guard behind him. If he discussed this with Master Wang now, it would be reported to Song Yuyan.

His expression turned cautious. Though Master Wang didn’t know the situation, he sensed Wu Chuan’s hesitation.

Su Nantian overheard their conversation and noticed Wu Chuan suddenly recall his presence. His expression grew more intriguing.

If they didn’t discuss this now, there might be no chance later. Wu Chuan had to focus on searching the estate.

At this, the Wang heir spoke: “I recognize him. He’s a Nan Gong guard. You can’t discuss this in front of him.”

Su Nantian was surprised. The Wang heir seemed uneducated but had a good memory. He had remained low-key, accompanying Nan Gong Ping in the Wu estate, yet the heir still noticed and remembered him.

Su Nantian knew he represented Nan Gong now. His presence made Wu Chuan uncomfortable, and even if he wanted to discuss with the Wang family, it was impossible.

But Master Wang unexpectedly laughed arrogantly. “Hahahaha! I thought it was something serious. Wu Chuan, you’ve become too cautious. Why not negotiate with us now? Do you really think you’ll find the assassins in this situation?

If Nan Gong doesn’t vote for you, and Huang’s two votes go elsewhere, we won’t get your approval or benefits. We’ll just vote as we please. Don’t regret it later.”

Su Nantian understood: the Wang and Nan Gong families were at odds. Even with his presence, they didn’t respect him. He was just a guard.

Wu Chuan listened and resolved himself: “Then, Master Wang, what do you want to discuss?”

“You offer Nan Gong the same conditions, and we’ll support you. I know you’ve invested heavily,” Master Wang said.

Wu Chuan was stunned: “That’s too much. I’ve offered Nan Gong good conditions, but they’re two votes. If I offer the same to you, it’s only one vote. That would be a loss.”

Huang followed Nan Gong, so Wu Chuan’s investment was worth two votes. How they divided it was their internal matter.

If Wu Chuan offered the same to Wang, he’d be foolish. It was a one-vote exchange.

But if he could lower the conditions, he’d be willing to secure Wang’s vote. After all, their search was unproductive, and they needed a backup plan in case they failed to find the assassins.

Su Nantian observed the negotiation and smirked. Alliances were about interests. Wu Chuan had agreed with Nan Gong, but now he sought another ally.

Master Wang nodded: “You’re right. Huang follows Nan Gong, so your offer effectively gains two votes. It seems excessive for us.”

Master Wang’s words were more than they appeared. The usually arrogant Wang family spoke this way, which was unusual.

Wu Chuan said nothing and waited for Master Wang’s next move. He feared speaking the wrong words.

Su Nantian felt ignored, yet he represented Nan Gong. Both Wu Chuan and Wang family members treated him as if he weren’t there.

They openly discussed Nan Gong’s matters, and Wang even tried to steal Wu Chuan’s promised benefits.

Chapter 494: Discovery

Wu Chuan and Master Wang’s conversation revealed that the Wang family didn’t want the same benefits as Nan Gong. But they still wanted Wu Chuan to offer them something.

Just as the critical negotiation began, Wu Chuan turned to Su Nantian and said: “Young man, I need to discuss something with the Wang family. To avoid delaying our search, why don’t you go check Huang’s place first?”

Wu Chuan’s words were clear—he wanted Su Nantian to leave.

The discussion with Wang was crucial. If Su Nantian overheard, it would harm both Wu and Wang families.

Su Nantian understood the dismissal. He nodded: “Fine, I’ll go check Huang’s place. Please hurry—time is limited.”

Su Nantian left immediately, heading downstairs.

After Su Nantian departed, Wu Chuan muttered: “Damn it. Who does this little guard think he is? Nan Gong’s strength lies in their own matters. This guard dares to threaten me.”

Clearly, Su Nantian had reminded him of the time constraint. Song Yuyan had said that if they didn’t find the four assassins before the banquet, Nan Gong would refuse to vote for Wu Chuan.

Su Nantian had subtly reminded Wu Chuan of this, even as he negotiated with Wang. After all, Nan Gong and Huang’s two votes were more stable for him.

“Nan Gong’s people are so arrogant. Never mind, let’s talk about this now,” Master Wang said with a smile.

Su Nantian went downstairs to Huang’s floor. Compared to the Wang family’s bustling corridor, this one was quiet. Only two guards stood outside Huang’s room—men Su Nantian recognized as those who had followed the Huang brothers.

Su Nantian approached and was stopped by them: “Who are you? What do you want?”

Su Nantian cleared his throat and said: “I’m a Nan Gong guard. Master Nan Gong was attacked, and we’re searching the premises. Wu Chuan’s men are already here. I’m checking ahead.”

Su Nantian expected them to let him in or at least inform the Huang family. But they remained unmoved: “We can’t let you in. Who knows what you’re up to?”

Su Nantian nearly choked. He hadn’t expected Huang’s guards to be so hostile.

“Then at least let you inform the master. Or do your rooms hide something you don’t want me to see?” Su Nantian said it as a threat, but one guard’s face turned pale.

Su Nantian noticed the man’s odd reaction and observed him closely. He realized he had seen this face before.

Quickly, Su Nantian wiped his hand across the guard’s face. When he pulled it away, it was covered in grease. The man’s real skin emerged—his face had been altered with makeup.

Su Nantian understood the trick. This was a simple disguise, not as effective as real face-changing, but it would fool most people. The guard’s identity was exposed.

The guard was stunned, and Su Nantian recognized the man’s face—the same one who had attacked Nan Gong earlier.

Su Nantian was shocked. He hadn’t expected the assassins to be from Huang. Yet, Huang had always been under Nan Gong’s protection. Why would they betray their patron now?

The guard, exposed, didn’t flee. He knew escape was impossible—everyone in the estate was under lockdown.

Su Nantian realized Huang had hidden these men, placing this one at the entrance as both a risk and a safe spot. But where were the others?

Su Nantian sneered: “Let me in and meet your master. You owe Nan Gong an explanation.”

“Master said he won’t see anyone,” the guard replied defiantly.

“If you don’t let me in, I’ll find someone else. Your secret is out—how dare you bargain with me?” Su Nantian watched them, amused.

The guards hesitated. One said: “Wait a moment. I’ll inform Master Huang.”

They entered, leaving Su Nantian outside.

Su Nantian wasn’t afraid of them trying to trick him. The Wu estate was in chaos, and if they did anything, it would put Huang at odds with everyone.

Not only had they attacked Nan Gong Ping before, but this incident in the Wu estate clearly showed disrespect. The Wu family would never forgive them.

So Su Nantian waited patiently, wondering what result the guards would bring. He also thought he might negotiate with Huang.

Chapter 495: Seizure

After waiting some time, the door opened again. One guard emerged and said to Su Nantian: “Master Huang wants you inside.”

Su Nantian smiled and entered. As he walked through the entrance hall into the living room, he saw one of the assassins standing by the two Huang brothers.

Su Nantian nodded to them and said: “What’s going on? You owe Nan Gong an explanation. If you can’t convince me, I’ll report this to your mistress.”

Su Nantian’s words were clear. He was telling the Huang brothers that he hadn’t yet informed Song Yuyan.

He was hinting they could bribe him with benefits.

The Huang brothers weren’t fools. They had spent years in business and understood Su Nantian’s implication.

Huang Zhiwei was the first to pat his seat and said: “Brother, don’t be in a hurry. Sit down—we’ll talk.”

“Can’t talk slowly. Wu Chuan is negotiating with Wang now. He’ll be down soon. Do you have time to talk?” Su Nantian’s words made it clear he was informing them of Wu Chuan’s actions.

“Then I’ll be direct. Yes, it was my men. You’ve seen the man. We won’t deny it. But this mustn’t be told to Nan Gong Ping or his mistress. Whatever you want, we’ll try to meet it,” Huang Zhihong said.

Su Nantian was surprised. He had expected the brothers to deny it, but they admitted it immediately.

This was exactly what Su Nantian wanted. He aimed to negotiate with Huang, seeking benefits for keeping the secret.

Su Nantian wasn’t after personal gain. He wanted to use other families’ help to rescue Wu Tao and Wu You’er.

As a guard in Nan Gong, he had limited access to the Wu family. But with other families’ support, he might create an opportunity.

Su Nantian frowned and said nothing about what he wanted.

Huang Zhihong said: “Brother, name your price. We’ll meet it if it’s not unreasonable. Our offer will ensure you a worry-free life, no longer needing to work as a guard.”

Su Nantian waved his hand: “Money isn’t important to me. My income in Nan Gong is satisfactory, and I don’t find being a guard hard. In fact, it’s enjoyable. Look at this scene—it’s quite interesting.”

Huang Zhiwei and Huang Zhihong were troubled. They hadn’t expected money to fail. This meant the guard wanted more than money, and whatever he asked would be precious.

But they knew if this was exposed, Nan Gong would destroy them. Their business secrets were known to Nan Gong.

Nan Gong could easily ruin Huang by tampering with those secrets. Plus, they knew Nan Gong Ping was crucial to Nan Gong Lin. Everyone saw the balance between the two siblings, but Nan Gong Lin secretly supported his less capable son.

If Nan Gong Ping was attacked and it was revealed to be Huang, the consequences would be severe.

Thus, Huang Zhiwei and Huang Zhihong knew they had to suppress this. They needed to deal with Su Nantian.

But the problem was that the guard didn’t want money. If he accepted it, there would be a chance to resolve this. But since he refused, it was a problem.

Huang Zhihong and Huang Zhiwei exchanged glances. Though they said nothing, their years of默契 allowed them to read each other’s thoughts.

Suddenly, Huang Zhihong grabbed a cushion from behind and hurled it at Su Nantian’s head. Huang Zhiwei pulled a gun from his waist and aimed it at the cushion.

Their actions were clear—the cushion was for silencing the gun. They intended to kill Su Nantian.

But at that moment, Su Nantian leaped into the air, knocking both men aside. He grabbed Huang Zhiwei’s arm and took the gun, pointing it at his head.

“Playing tricks is pointless. How long did I fight alone against four of them in your master’s room?” You two amateurs dare to challenge me?

Su Nantian spoke as he held the gun to Huang Zhiwei’s head, pulling the safety off. One trigger pull would blow his head apart.

Huang Zhiwei was stunned, unable to react. He couldn’t believe they had been outmaneuvered.

But his body trembled with fear.

Huang Zhihong quickly reassured Su Nantian: “Brother, don’t be angry. Let’s talk calmly.”

Chapter 496: Secrets

Su Nantian smiled at Huang Zhihong’s words and said, “Earlier I wanted to talk nicely, but you did this. Now you say we should talk calmly?”
