Chen Jiayi feared they would ruin her plans, so she ordered them to leave quickly. She stood at the entrance of the restaurant, waiting for them to emerge. Su Nantian and his companions finished their meal and headed toward the restaurant's exit. The leader, Su Nantian, was低头抱着手机看最近发布的有关于他的视频. Suddenly, a figure collapsed beside him; instinctively, he wrapped his arm around her waist. "Ah!" Chen Jiayi clung to Su Nantian's neck, greedily absorbing his distinctive scent. She then inserted her business card into Su Nantian's jacket pocket, offering him a breathtaking smile before turning and swaying her hips away. To seduce a man, one must have some strategy; directly begging for intimacy would never earn true love. Su Nantian instantly understood her intent, rubbing the edge of the card with his hand, a slight smile tugging at his lips before he carelessly tossed the card into the trash. How tedious, he had no time to waste on such people. His companions, Wu Lianxing and another, also noticed Chen Jiayi's subtle intentions, cursing her shamelessly in their hearts but unable to voice their thoughts. Yet they were surprised Su Nantian discarded the card so decisively, which lifted their spirits somewhat. After leaving the cafeteria, Su Nantian first escorted Wu Lianxing back to her dormitory. Then he and Gao Jingjing walked through the vast campus, night deepening as only a few people remained. Gao Jingjing trailed behind Su Nantian, head lowered, fingers curled together as she fidgeted with her sleeve. After a while, she timidly raised her head and spoke: "Nantian elder brother, am I not pretty?" Su Nantian was startled by Gao Jingjing's words and halted, crouching to meet her gaze. "What's wrong, Jingjing? Who said you're not beautiful?" A joke! If anyone claimed she was unattractive, there would be few truly handsome people left in the world!" Gao Jingjing blinked her enchanting large eyes, nervously pressing her lips together. Finally, she mustered her courage and asked: "Then why do you always say I'm your sister?" Su Nantian laughed at the realization, waving his hand: "Where did you get that idea? I call you my sister because you're still young." Gao Jingjing's eyes lit up, her heart warmed as she smiled joyfully. Perhaps when she grew older, he would... Thinking this, Gao Jingjing rushed to Su Nantian's side and tugged his clothes downward with a fierce pull. "Smack!" She kissed Su Nantian's cheek directly before running into the teaching building. Left alone, Su Nantian stood in stunned silence. This Gao Jingjing had truly grown more cunning. He raised his hand to touch his face, confirming a red imprint still warm with residual heat—though he eventually reluctantly wiped it away. After so many years, this was the first time a young girl had dared to be so bold. If the immortals in the cultivation world learned of this, they would surely laugh until their sides ached! Su Nantian thought of this and shivered, then stretched his long legs to chase after the fleeing Gao Jingjing. After sternly reprimanding her, Su Nantian finally relented. He then remembered to visit the principal to inquire about new student procedures. As he approached the office, a sudden outcry echoed from a room at the corner of the building. After Su Nantian knocked twice, a rustling sound came from inside, as if two people had been startled. Indeed, the room was lit by a single dim lamp, its weak glow illuminating the space but failing to reach the dark corners. The room's back had several glass windows, though it was secluded by location. Yet in the dark night, with all other floors' lights extinguished, this room's glow would surely draw attention. It was no surprise the principal was inept, relying on visual gratification. He lit this dim lamp to satisfy his desires, but that became his greatest flaw. At this moment, two figures entwined in the room. The air was thick with an unpleasant odor. Combined with Su Nantian's knock, the principal immediately wilted. Almost simultaneously, the woman rolled her eyes, as if mocking the man's incompetence. The principal, after catching his breath, erupted in anger. He had just managed to sneak out of his wife's sight for a brief pleasure, only to be interrupted by this man! His wife was notoriously fierce, and he had waited for her to leave on a trip before seizing this opportunity. Now disturbed, who knew when he'd get another chance? His entire demeanor soured; without a second thought, he barked at the door: "Who's this fool? Don't you sleep at night and knock on others' doors?" He added: "Don't let me find out who you are, or I'll have you expelled from this school tomorrow!" Hmph. Such a threat usually made people flee immediately. He was notorious for holding grudges in this school, and no one dared provoke him. Thinking this, the principal resumed his efforts with renewed vigor.

Chapter 143: A Single Word Reveals the Truth
Outside, Su Nantian raised an eyebrow and no longer cared about the two people inside. Originally, he had intended to knock to grant them some dignity, avoiding awkwardness upon entering. Who could have anticipated the principal's skin was so thick? Since he didn't care for face, Su Nantian had no need to spare him any. With his hands in his pockets, Su Nantian kicked the door open with a single footstep. The sturdy wooden door flew off its hinges, ending its life. Su Nantian's kick was heart-stopping; the corridor still echoed with the sound of the door crashing open. The two inside screamed at the noise. As Su Nantian kicked the door open, he smelled the foul odor inside and wrinkled his nose, waving it away until the scent dissipated. He then stepped into the room. Upon entering, he saw two overlapping figures on the table. Not only had they been disturbed in their pleasure, but Su Nantian had also forced his way in—this shock left the principal with an indelible trauma. His gaze toward Su Nantian was filled with a desire to tear him apart. "You're the principal of this school?" Su Nantian glanced at him with disdain. "Yes, I'm Yuan Xiong. What do you want to rebel? Leave immediately... don't you see I'm handling important matters?" Yuan Xiong barked. "Do you know Gao Qingyun?" Su Nantian said calmly. At this moment, Yuan Xiong was seething with anger, but Su Nantian's question instantly stifled his rage, leaving his chest tight. "Gao Qingyun! What's your name?" Yuan Xiong repeated, as if confirming but immediately realized. "Su Nantian!" Yuan Xiong's heart jolted; he quickly sent the woman away. He dared not offend Gao Qingyun's face, especially since this youth was clearly close to Gao Qingyun. Yuan Xiong furrowed his brows, unamusedly pulling out a cigar from the desk drawer and lighting it with practiced ease. Su Nantian leaned against the wall, watching the smoke swirl around the principal's corpulent face. He couldn't help but laugh. Yuan Xiong heard Su Nantian's laughter and, recalling the awkwardness of his entrance, naturally thought he was mocking him. Thus, the principal's face darkened further. He snorted and inhaled deeply, standing up from his chair and adjusting his pants. Su Nantian raised an eyebrow at the corpulent man, whose frailty was evident even before a single punch. Yuan Xiong approached the light switch, turning on the room's illumination and unplugging the small yellow lamp he had lit to draw attention. He twisted it a few times before tossing it into the cabinet under the desk. After doing so, he panted slightly and sat back down, taking a few more puffs of the cigar. Regardless of who had sent Su Nantian, he would need to handle matters with him. So, he let Su Nantian speak first and intended to give him a warning. As this thought crossed his mind, the half of Yuan Xiong's face hidden in shadow involuntarily curled into a smile. This small trick was obviously trivial to Su Nantian, who could guess the principal's intention with a single strand of hair. He knew the principal was deliberately avoiding conversation to give him a warning. Thus, Su Nantian unexpectedly said: "Principal, I see your body is getting worse." Yuan Xiong had expected Su Nantian to ask for his help first, but instead, the first words were about his health! He hated being told he was unfit, especially as a man. His forehead veins bulged; he roared at Su Nantian: "You're talking nonsense! Saying I'm unfit! Look how imposing I am, you blind!" Su Nantian listened to the principal's crude words and surveyed his physique. Indeed, besides fat and illness, he had a pig's brain—nothing else. Su Nantian wasn't angry at the insults but sat on the sofa opposite the desk, adjusting his posture. Though he was shorter by half a meter than the principal, Su Nantian's aura made the principal involuntarily swallow his saliva and retreat half a step. This Yuan Xiong, indulging in both meat and wine for years, was likely a daily companion of women. His body had long been drained, yet while emptying it, he kept adding fat—making him both weak and greasy. Moreover... as Su Nantian had anticipated, the principal's body was likely drugged by someone close. This drug wasn't like a fierce potion that would weaken him immediately; otherwise, with so many people in the school, clever individuals could easily detect it. The drug in Yuan Xiong's body was likely administered gradually over time by someone close, ensuring he remained under their control. If they didn't intend to kill him, it was because they wanted to keep him under their grip. The most plausible explanation was that one of the women around Yuan Xiong had used such underhanded methods to keep him. Su Nantian shook his head; the phrase "a sword on one's head" was epitomized in Yuan Xiong's life. "You don't need to be so angry; sit down, and I'll explain clearly." Su Nantian pointed at the principal's chair. Yuan Xiong, though still furious, had to sit down since Su Nantian's words concerned his health. He would listen carefully to what he had to say, or else Yuan Xiong's gaze turned dangerous. "You've noticed your time has been getting shorter, right? Hard to control it." Su Nantian bluntly stated Yuan Xiong's most embarrassing flaw, causing a flush of shame to rise on his face. "What are you talking about? Get out!" The principal grabbed a pen holder and hurled it at Su Nantian. However, Su Nantian remained seated, one hand supporting his head while the other calmly caught Yuan Xiong's thrown pen holder and tossed it back to its original place.

Chapter 144: Becoming a New Student
This made Yuan Xiong sit up straight immediately; this Su Nantian truly had some skills. "You don't admit it, but that's normal for anyone to avoid." He paused, then continued: "But I still need to tell you the truth. Your body has already been drained, and someone took advantage of it, giving you drugs gradually." Yuan Xiong's face paled upon hearing this. "This person wants to keep your long-term favor, so they can exchange benefits with you." "They didn't hesitate to plant poison in your body. This drug isn't deep, but it wears away like water dripping on stone." Su Nantian said this while leaning forward, as if to better observe Yuan Xiong's expression. "Do you understand the meaning of 'water dripping on stone'?" "In short, have you been experiencing kidney deficiency, back pain, lung discomfort, digestive issues, irritability, and frequent illnesses these past two years?" Though it was a question, Su Nantian's tone suggested certainty. Before Yuan Xiong could react, Su Nantian walked to the desk and took a piece of paper and pen, writing several lines. Yuan Xiong leaned over to see it was a prescription. After finishing, Su Nantian tossed the paper into Yuan Xiong's arms. Yuan Xiong hesitantly took it and examined it carefully. Seeing his doubtful expression, Su Nantian sighed in disdain. "This is truly a pile of mud that can't be lifted." Suddenly, Yuan Xiong's mind sparked with an idea. He remembered that Gao Qingyun's daughter had been healed by a mysterious young man—could it be him? Yuan Xiong glanced at Su Nantian with suspicion, recalling his earlier strength and confidence. It was likely him. Thinking this, Yuan Xiong folded the prescription repeatedly before carefully tucking it into his jacket pocket. Su Nantian saw this and knew Yuan Xiong would definitely go to a renowned doctor the next day to try the prescription. Once he saw its effects, he would realize it hadn't harmed him. Such caution made one wonder why he didn't notice the drug in the first place. Perhaps it was because of the women's gentle allure that clouded his mind. After securing Su Nantian's prescription, Yuan Xiong's face turned fawning. He quickly changed his earlier furious expression into a smiling, servile one and walked down from the chair to express gratitude by shaking Su Nantian's hand. Though Su Nantian had no aversion to germs, he didn't want to shake hands with such an oily man. Before Yuan Xiong could approach, Su Nantian had already put his hands in his pockets and changed positions, continuing to sit on the sofa. Yuan Xiong's face froze at this scene, as if volcanic rock had cooled rapidly—Su Nantian was amazed to see such an oily man display so many facial expressions. However, within three seconds, Yuan Xiong's frozen smile broke out again. "You see, you see— I just wanted to thank you for your help. Never mind, the child is shy with elders." Yuan Xiong made an excuse and turned around to walk toward another chair. As he turned, Yuan Xiong quickly sneered at Su Nantian. When Yuan Xiong sat back in his chair, he still smiled warmly and looked at Su Nantian kindly: "Gao's boss sent this young man to me. I suppose there's something he needs, right? Just say it; whatever I can do, I'll do immediately. If I can't, I'll find a way to help you." Su Nantian despised such people who spoke in circles without sincerity. Before Yuan Xiong could finish, he waved his hand to interrupt: "It's not like you have to go through fire and water. If it were, you wouldn't dare." Yuan Xiong sighed and rubbed his nose without responding. Su Nantian continued: "This matter is simple—just give me an enrollment form." Hearing this request, Yuan Xiong was both amused and exasperated: "Look at you, such a small matter. You came so late at night..." Su Nantian snorted: "I didn't expect to see Yuan Xiong and some unknown woman engaging in such tireless activities at this hour." "Yes, it's about exercising, isn't it?" Yuan Xiong quickly added with a fawning smile. Su Nantian lifted his eyelids and glanced at him, causing Yuan Xiong to immediately fall silent. "Tomorrow I'll come directly for class—go to the first-year English department's new student class." Saying this, Su Nantian stood up, brushed off the dust on his clothes, and left. Yuan Xiong smiled broadly, standing halfway up from his chair: "Alright, young man, take your time. Be careful, be careful!" After Su Nantian completely exited the hollow doorway, Yuan Xiong's expression darkened again. He spat at Su Nantian's direction and sank back into his chair, which creaked under his weight. Sitting in the chair, he carefully examined the prescription again and recalled Su Nantian's words. His gaze was deep, as if seeing through the prescription to something hidden. The small eyes buried in his fat instantly turned dangerous.

Chapter 145: Self-Introduction
The next morning, the weather was clear and bright with no clouds. The temperature was moderate, and Su Nantian was about to relive his college life. Thus, upon waking up, he felt everything in the world was pleasant and comfortable. It reminded him of an old saying: "Happiness makes one's spirit bright." Thinking about this, Su Nantian paused. This phrase sounded so much like that of an old man in his fifties. He didn't care and tidied himself up thoroughly, then followed Gao Jingjing out of the dormitory to college. It was better not to be late on the first day. Speaking of Su Nantian's two million years in the cultivation world, he had spent every day doing nothing. He often watched the human world's daily life and was very interested in reliving college life, which he had always wanted to experience. Fortunately, he benefited from Gao Jingjing's connection; she was the precious daughter of Gao Qingyun. Her name, "Jingjing," meant "bright and clear." This girl had a background as strong as her father's, yet she was quiet and gentle, unlike the domineering daughters of aristocratic families. She was more kind and low-key. When others saw Gao Jingjing approaching, she stood out like a fresh chrysanthemum in a crowd of common flowers—fragrant and charming. Though many people didn't know Gao Jingjing's background, her beauty had already earned her the title of "class flower" in her department. However, Su Nantian didn't enter Gao Jingjing's second year but instead joined the first-year English department.

Chapter 146: It Was Her
When Su Nantian arrived at the classroom right as the bell rang, it was already full. His entrance immediately drew everyone's attention. Standing at the podium was a girl writing on the blackboard, her back graceful and alluring—her curves were perfectly proportioned. She wore a tight-fitting long dress that accentuated her figure, adding to her charm. Su Nantian raised his hand and knocked on the already open classroom door. Zhu Ying was distracted by the knocking sound and turned around to see a handsome boy at the doorway. Many female students in the class let out small gasps and began whispering. Zhu Ying quickly put down her chalk, wiped the dust from her hands, and walked toward Su Nantian: "Hello, student. Are you a new arrival? I'm your counselor, Zhu Ying. I graduated two years ago from this school." Su Nantian raised an eyebrow and nodded to Zhu Ying, the mature woman: "Good afternoon, counselor. I'm a student who came here today." Zhu Ying confirmed Su Nantian was the special student assigned by Yuan Xiong the day before. She looked at him more carefully. Su Nantian's placement in this class was also a scheme by Yuan Xiong, who had understood the new teachers' mindset. They always felt it was their mission to serve students. Yuan Xiong had used this method on many new female teachers, and it was always effective. Zhu Ying was the most passionate and attractive among this batch of female teachers. Yuan Xiong had secretly extended his dirty hands toward Zhu Ying, but she was unaware of it. At this moment, Zhu Ying smiled and guided Su Nantian to the podium: "This new student, please introduce yourself." Su Nantian nodded and followed Zhu Ying's guidance to the podium. When he was at the doorway, the door blocked half of his body, yet many female students still whispered about him. When Su Nantian reached the podium, his appearance was fully revealed to the new students. He had exceptionally handsome features and, after spending two million years in the cultivation world, still carried a divine aura that was rare to see in modern times. His tall and imposing figure with an inverted triangle physique made him look even more powerful, as if wearing a model's outfit. No, he was even better than the models. Immediately, all the female students' eyes were glued to him. After a brief silence, the murmurs among the new students grew louder. Upon closer listening, they were all excited discussions from the girls. The male students, on the other hand, clenched their fists and saw Su Nantian as a rival. Those who had originally planned to use their charm to chase female classmates now felt defeated. With Su Nantian in the class, how could they catch any girls? The girls would surely cling to Su Nantian and be impossible to pull away. After this thought, before Su Nantian even introduced himself, some had already labeled him as a god or an obstacle. Each had their own worries. Su Nantian felt a premonition that this college life might be different from before. He surveyed the room and said calmly: "Hello, everyone. I'm a new student named Su Nantian." After saying this, he turned and took a piece of chalk from the blackboard to write his name. The three characters immediately caused the girls to gasp again. "Truly, the calligraphy matches his appearance! Look at this handwriting—so elegant and flowing, it's no less than that of a master!" "Talking about calligraphy, look at how handsome he is compared to the stars on TV!" "Alas, our class will surely be trampled by female classmates!" Some girls gathered and laughed, their voices growing louder until Zhu Ying had to intervene: "Alright, everyone, quiet down. Quiet down." The girls complied reluctantly but still stared at Su Nantian's every move with longing eyes. "Su student, is there anything else you want to say to the classmates?" Zhu Ying asked gently. Su Nantian smiled and shook his head: "No, I have nothing else to say." This smile made Zhu Ying pause. This Su Nantian had a divine aura in his eyes, and when he smiled, his eyes seemed to sparkle with stars. Zhu Ying was pulled back to reality by the girls' murmurs. She unconsciously felt troubled; why was she acting like a student? This boy wasn't just her junior but also her student. How could she fall for a student? Zhu Ying combed through her long curly hair and sighed. The girls in the seats began another round of discussion. "Did you see it? Did you see it!" "I did, I did! That smile made me so仙 (divine), I got goosebumps!" "When this little brother smiled, his eyes had stars in them!" "Ugh... why did I learn that our class has such a god? I'll regret it for life!" The girls' gasps echoed, eventually making the boys unable to bear it. One boy said emotionlessly: "What's so good about being handsome? There are still many duds in this school. Do you think they'll play with makeup?" This boy was handsome but, compared to Su Nantian, he was clearly inferior. Su Nantian's appearance wasn't ordinary; combined with his divine aura, this boy lost badly. Still, many male students stood up to mock: "Yes, this school is still about strength. What's the use of being so handsome? A dud!" This statement caused many girls to become upset. "What are you talking about? If you don't know how to dress, at least don't be so ugly!" "Exactly! Don't tell me you didn't know that someone chased away the two suitors of Gao Jingjing yesterday, and his name was also Su Nantian!" "My god! Could it be the same person?" "Ah, I'm going to faint. What kind of god is this!"

Chapter 147: It Was Her
These revelations made the entire classroom immediately erupt. This Su Nantian truly had both beauty and strength, being so handsome and powerful. Even Zhu Ying's gaze toward Su Nantian carried a hint of surprise. Initially, she had thought the boys' comments about Su Nantian were biased; after all, this Su Nantian was so handsome, but his strength might not be as formidable. After all, no one is perfect. They didn't know that for a cultivator like Su Nantian, these were basic operations. Hearing the girls' murmurs, Zhu Ying naturally knew about this matter. The chaos at the school gate caused by Gao Jingjing had spread throughout the entire school, especially since it was at the entrance. Due to not being present, she had only heard exaggerated rumors—both good and bad—but Su Nantian's name was repeatedly mentioned. Zhu Ying recalled the discussion among teachers in the office yesterday, all marveling at Su Nantian's strength and his great power. He was likely to become one of the school's风云人物 (legendary figures). Unexpectedly, today morning, Su Nantian stood before her, saying "Good afternoon, counselor." Zhu Ying felt it was almost unreal and secretly pinched her thigh to confirm it wasn't a dream. A student with such formidable strength was in her class! The Su Nantian on the podium noticed Zhu Ying's action and found it amusing. This counselor was truly adorable. After regaining her composure, Zhu Ying waved to the students: "Everyone, quiet down! Quiet down!" The class quickly fell silent. Zhu Ying then smiled and said to Su Nantian: "Su student, please choose a seat and sit down. We'll start class soon." Su Nantian nodded and scanned the classroom from right to left, searching for an empty seat. He couldn't choose a spot among the boys; they would cause trouble constantly. He also couldn't choose a seat among the girls; they were too noisy. The entire classroom's girls followed Su Nantian's gaze, gasping in unison. As soon as his gaze reached a spot, the girls there would gasp. Seeing this scene, Su Nantian was certain that seats among the girls couldn't be chosen. After searching thoroughly, he finally found a seat at the very back. This class was likely for top students; everyone competed for front seats, leaving the last three rows almost empty. Especially the very back seat had only one girl sitting there, alone and indifferent to everything happening in the classroom. This girl sat by the window with an earphone in her ear, gazing at the scenery outside. Sunlight streamed through the window, casting a golden glow over her, making her appear peaceful but marred by her thick bangs. However, Su Nantian unexpectedly wanted to sit beside her. He believed in his intuition; this girl had a story. He nodded at Zhu Ying and carried his belongings, walking step by step to that seat amidst everyone's gaze. When Su Nantian descended from the podium, the girls gasped again, as if he had chosen their seats. But he didn't choose the first row, nor the second or third. Finally, Su Nantian stopped at the very back and stood beside this girl. This caused another round of gasps from the class, but not with admiration—rather, fear. Under everyone's astonished gaze, Su Nantian asked: "May I sit beside you?" The girl seemed to notice someone was standing next to her. She looked up with a bewildered expression, then after a brief moment of confusion, she adopted an indifferent demeanor. This amused Su Nantian; she was still a girl but acted so mature. The girl didn't answer. So Su Nantian asked again: "May I sit beside you?" This time, the girl confirmed Su Nantian was speaking to her but still didn't answer. She only moved the items on her desk. Su Nantian smiled and calmly sat down. Compared to their calmness, the class was anything but. The girls whispered again: "What's going on? Why didn't you choose any of these seats but chose this one!" One girl was unhappy and pulled back the seat she had prepared for Su Nantian. "You think he's been bewitched by her pretentiousness? Look at her." "Hmph, pretending to be indifferent. She's probably planning how to trap Su Nantian!" "Exactly! You saw her, she asked him twice. She must be overjoyed inside!" "It doesn't make sense..." One girl took out a mirror from her bag and placed it on the desk, then looked at her forehead in the mirror: "My face is clean and has nothing. How could I not be as good as a girl with a birthmark!" Birthmark? Ugly? These derogatory terms naturally reached Su Nantian's ears. Though he remained expressionless, his ears moved with the sound. "Don't say it, she has a birthmark. I saw it and was scared. Su Nantian wants to sit with her, he must be terrified." "If Su Nantian is scared by that ugly thing on her face, what a pity!" Compared to the girls' sighs, the boys scoffed: "What are you worrying about? He just likes that kind. You're better off with Zhang Mengyao, the ugly girl." Though these discussions were quiet, they were clearly heard by Su Nantian. "What did you say? You dare to say the auntie isn't as good as an ugly girl!" The girl, provoked, stood up with her hands on her hips and glared at the boy who had spoken. The boy hadn't expected his careless comment would ignite such anger. It was because they were all new students and didn't know each other's temperaments. He hadn't expected to meet a firecracker. Even though the girl was so angry, the boy didn't want to retaliate but smiled and said: "I was just joking. I'm sorry."

Chapter 148: Birthmark
The girl wasn't sure if Su Nantian had heard their argument, but now that this pig had exposed her secret, she wondered if Su Nantian would be upset. The girl shyly glanced at Su Nantian, who was organizing his desk. Zhang Mengyao still wore her earphones and gazed out the window, as if she hadn't heard their discussion. "Good, good!" The girl sighed and turned to scold the boy: "Close your mouth. Know what to say and what not to." "I'll be careful with my words," the boy interjected. "You don't say anything!" The girl added fiercely and sat down. On the podium, Zhu Ying saw their one-sided argument end and tapped the blackboard: "You students are really hot-tempered. But you need to unite and overcome the challenges ahead." The students obediently said "Yes," and Zhu Ying added: "Especially the boys, don't bully the girls anymore!" This statement was just made when the boy who had been scolded scratched his head: "Yes, yes. The teacher is right." After this reprimand, no one dared to talk back; they listened attentively. However, the previous discussions lingered in Su Nantian's mind, leaving a big question mark.
