Su Nantian spoke thus, his expression one of solemnity as he gazed at Nan Gong Fei.
“Ah?”
When Nan Gong Fei heard Su Nantian’s reply, he wore an expression of profound significance.
He then curled his lips into a faint smile: “Indeed, that is commendable. I knew you were a shrewd individual; it seems your choice aligns with my expectations.”
As Nan Gong Fei spoke these words, he scrutinized Su Nantian with an inscrutable gaze, weighing his response and carefully discerning the authenticity of his promise.
Su Nantian heard Nan Gong Fei’s words and chuckled inwardly, yet his countenance betrayed no emotion. Instead, he adopted an even more respectful demeanor, as though genuinely in awe of Nan Gong Fei.
He then addressed Nan Gong Fei: “I wonder, Cousin Master, what task do you wish me to undertake for you?”
As Su Nantian spoke these words, he discreetly observed Nan Gong Fei’s expression with his peripheral vision. Continuing, he said: “Cousin Master may reveal it now; I assure you, within my capacity, I shall spare no effort to assist Cousin Master and alleviate your burdens.”
Such promises had become second nature to Su Nantian, uttered with unflinching composure and devoid of any discernible deceit.
It seemed as though these words were spoken from the depths of his heart, their sincerity unassailable.
“Excellent. Your awareness is admirable.”
Upon hearing Su Nantian’s pledge, Nan Gong Fei’s expression bore a newfound satisfaction, his eyes flickering with admiration for Su Nantian.
Yet Nan Gong Fei did not immediately issue his orders. Instead, he told Su Nantian: “For now, do not rush. Return and await news patiently; when your assistance is required, I shall inform you in advance.”
After uttering these words, Nan Gong Fei added with measured deliberation: “However, for the next few days, I must ask you to remain vigilant by Cousin Elder’s side. Any information regarding the wetland bidding, you may report to me immediately.”
There it was—the fox’s tail had revealed itself. Indeed, his scheme remained centered on the wetland project.
Su Nantian mused inwardly, a mixture of amusement and irony stirring within him.
Though the wetland bidding was undeniably lucrative, it seemed excessive for these families to resort to such underhanded methods.
Not only did the rival clans engage in open competition, but internal strife had become unavoidable.
As he pondered this, Su Nantian mused further: Did profit truly hold such power that it could strip people of their very essence, rendering them slaves to material gain?
At this thought, he cast a furtive glance at Nan Gong Fei. Upon seeing the latter’s resolute expression and unyielding ambition, Su Nantian shook his head slowly.
He understood these individuals were not of the same path as himself, akin to how sparrows could never fathom the aspirations of swans.
After clarifying this, Su Nantian ceased to dwell on matters unrelated to him. He swiftly adjusted his emotions, banishing all thoughts that should not have lingered.
This was Su Nantian’s own habit; otherwise, after completing so many tasks and assuming so many roles, he would have long since lost his mind.
He immediately responded to Nan Gong Fei with utmost reverence, adding: “Cousin Master may rest assured; I shall ensure your instructions are carried out flawlessly.”
He then appended: “No matter what stirrings Cousin Elder may have, I shall report them to you immediately.”
“Indeed. Do well, and I shall not disappoint you.”
Upon receiving Su Nantian’s reply, Nan Gong Fei wore a satisfied smile.
Nan Gong Fei then praised Su Nantian, before withdrawing a black card from his pocket.
Chapter 706: Pretending to Cooperate
“By the way, this is my supplementary card; it holds a limit of 300,000.”
Nan Gong Fei spoke with a light tone, his gaze one of arrogance as he surveyed Su Nantian. Even the act of producing a supplementary card had him lifting his nose in disdain.
“Do not rush to rejoice.”
At this, Nan Gong Fei paused before continuing with an air of condescension: “I have stated before, I shall never betray those who serve me faithfully. Your response pleases me; thus, this is your first reward. The better you perform, the greater your rewards shall be.”
After uttering these words, Nan Gong Fei gently placed the supplementary card into Su Nantian’s hand. As he did so, his gaze conveyed an unspoken directive: to serve diligently.
“Thank you, Cousin Master! Please rest assured!”
Su Nantian responded with a grateful expression, as though genuinely awed by Nan Gong Fei’s generosity.
He joyfully accepted the black card, rubbing it carefully in his palm before scrutinizing it with meticulous attention, playing the role of an unworldly rustic to perfection.
After this performance, he again thanked Nan Gong Fei: “Thank you, Cousin Master!”
In truth, Su Nantian found it amusing. Were it not for the necessity of maintaining appearances, he might have burst into laughter.
After all, Li’s assistant had offered him three million!
And Wu Chuan had even raised this figure tenfold. One could only imagine Nan Gong Fei’s reaction if he learned of Wu Family’s offer—surely it would be most amusing.
Su Nantian suppressed his mirth, feigning compliance with Nan Gong Fei before dismissing him.
After sending Nan Gong Fei away, Su Nantian prepared to seek out Lv Li, hoping to glean information about Wu You’er from her.
At this moment, Su Nantian was still racking his brains to find a way to locate Wu You’er swiftly and rescue her. He had no inkling of the terrifying news soon to be revealed.
Su Nantian contacted Lv Li via their usual method.
He then directly inquired: “Have you received any new information today? Lv Li?”
Su Nantian addressed her without preamble, wasting no time.
“No.”
Lv Li bit her lip in restraint, her fingers intertwining nervously, as if burdened by guilt for her inadequacy.
After answering Su Nantian’s question, Lv Li immediately added with remorse: “Forgive me, Master Su. I am but a lowly servant; I cannot approach nor discover the room where Miss Wu resides…”
Lv Li spoke the first part with deep remorse, then muttered softly: “It is my own failure.”
“Nothing at all? Reconsider carefully?”
Upon hearing Lv Li’s answer, Su Nantian felt profound disappointment. Yet Wu Chuan’s security was excessively stringent; due to his suspicious nature, he rarely accepted newcomers. All servants within were generations of hired staff, traceable back three generations.
This was why Su Nantian and his team could not plant spies or coordinate from within, prolonging the mission unnecessarily.
Moreover, this task had not only failed to progress but remained stagnant, their efforts yielding no results.
After contemplating this, Su Nantian fixed Lv Li with a serious gaze, desperate to extract any clues.
“Oh! I remember!”
Upon hearing Su Nantian’s urgent tone, Lv Li grew anxious. Her palms became damp with sweat from the intensity of her worry.
After pacing a few steps, she suddenly exclaimed: “Master Su, I recall! Though I have not found Miss Wu’s room nor been able to meet her, I am not entirely without discovery!”
“Indeed? Speak quickly!”
Upon hearing this, Su Nantian felt a surge of excitement but restrained it, fearing it might pressure Wu You’er.
“Miss Wu seems to have improved significantly! She has begun eating again, and the kitchen has prepared her meals today!”
At this point, Lv Li’s expression brightened, as though genuinely elated for Wu You’er: “Miss Wu must be fine!”
Otherwise, why would she begin eating?
As Lv Li mused this, her expression relaxed further. Though Wu You’er’s whereabouts remained unknown, at least this marked a promising start—there was now good news!
“Something is amiss.”
Initially, when Su Nantian heard this news, he too felt reassured, even elated for Wu You’er.
Yet now, as he reflected, he gradually discerned the anomaly.
Su Nantian spoke in a low voice, his expression now grave.
Lv Li, upon hearing Su Nantian’s words, first blinked in surprise before staring at him anxiously: “What is it? Master Su, have you discovered something amiss?”
After asking this, she remained anxiously watching Su Nantian.
“Indeed, there is something wrong.”
Su Nantian replied, gazing intently at Lv Li before continuing: “This situation is suspicious.”
At this point, Su Nantian paused slightly before adopting a more solemn expression. He then questioned Lv Li further:
“Lv Li, did you witness the kitchen preparing meals for Wu You’er these past days?”
“Yes!”
Upon hearing this, Lv Li was puzzled by Su Nantian’s intent. She hesitated slightly before answering truthfully: “I would not be mistaken.”
“Then consider—what dishes did you observe them preparing?”
Su Nantian continued, his tone coaxing. He was guiding Lv Li to uncover the issue herself.
“They are the same as usual—chicken, duck, fish, meat, and various seafood. Quite abundant.”
Lv Li furrowed her brow, recalling carefully before informing Su Nantian of the dishes. It seemed she had yet to grasp the issue.
“Thus, this is the problem.”
Upon hearing this, Su Nantian’s expression grew even graver.
Chapter 707: Who Is Lying?
“Lv Li, have you realized it yet?”
He gazed at her solemnly, no longer waiting for her to deduce it herself but directly prompting her.
“Consider this: if someone had just recovered from a severe illness, would they begin indulging in rich meals?”
“Certainly not. Their appetite would be affected; they would likely consume only porridge to regulate it.”
Lv Li answered confidently. At this point, she paused, realizing the issue herself.
“Indeed! If she were truly ill, how could she be eating such lavish meals?”
Lv Li finally understood, her expression one of bewilderment. She stepped forward, gazing earnestly at Su Nantian.
“What is the situation, Master Su? I specifically inquired with the kitchen and confirmed they had indeed delivered meals to Miss Wu’s room. They would not deceive me, would they?”
At this thought, Lv Li again displayed a tense expression.
“No, it is not they who deceive you.”
Rather, someone was lying—or deliberately misleading.
Su Nantian understood more than Lv Li; his experiences far surpassed hers by countlessfold, allowing him to contemplate deeply and consider thoroughly.
Upon connecting these thoughts, he had already deduced several possibilities. Yet all pointed to one truth: Wu You’er’s condition was not improving, and it might have worsened!
At this realization, Su Nantian’s expression darkened further.
He now feared Wu You’er’s condition and questioned whether this mission could proceed smoothly.
Su Nantian did not know why this task had become so arduous, but never before had he encountered such a challenge. Not one element of timing, opportunity, or circumstance was in his favor.
At this thought, Su Nantian’s mood grew heavier.
His anxiety over Wu You’er had caused his hands to clench involuntarily into fists.
Moreover, his grip was so tight that the veins on his hands stood out prominently, and even his arms appeared taut. His face was shadowed by deep concern, devoid of any relaxation.
Su Nantian felt as though his heart were suffocated by the weight of this mission.
“Forgive me, Master Su! It is my own inadequacy; I am truly useless and could not uncover even this small piece of information!”
At this moment, Lv Li began to apologize loudly to Su Nantian, her chest puffed out as she vowed to do her utmost. Yet her efforts had yielded nothing, and she could not aid Su Nantian in the slightest.
How could she help rescue Wu You’er with such a failure?
The more Lv Li thought, the more guilty she felt. Her expression was contorted with distress, her features furrowed in anguish and self-reproach.
“No, it is not your fault. Do not blame yourself.”
Su Nantian had no time to console Lv Li; he too felt disoriented. Thus, he simply interrupted her and offered a brief reassurance: “Do not dwell on it now. Return, lest lingering too long alert the Wu family and reveal our suspicions.”
After consoling Lv Li, he did not wait for her response but hurriedly added: “I have other matters to attend to. Return now, and continue observing. Report any findings immediately.”
“Yes, Master Su! I shall strive diligently this time!”
Lv Li responded promptly. She silently vowed to give her all, vowing not to hinder Su Nantian again.
“Indeed.”
Su Nantian nodded, replying softly before allowing Lv Li to depart.
“I cannot remain idle any longer; this is no different from sitting and waiting for death.”
After Lv Li left, Su Nantian remained in place. His hands still clenched into fists, their grip tightening further.
At this moment, Su Nantian spoke aloud, his voice a low murmur—almost to himself.
Then he suddenly raised his head, his eyes now resolute and determined.
Su Nantian’s primary mission was Wu You’er; the Wu couple were merely an added burden she had insisted upon.
It was because Wu You’er had firmly refused to leave without her parents that Su Nantian had agreed to a long-term plan.
Yet now, the situation was no longer as he had anticipated. It was a critical moment!
Wu You’er suffered from severe anorexia, and the internal information blockade was so tight that he could not obtain any details about her.
Thus, under these circumstances, he could break their original plan.
At this moment, Su Nantian had made up his mind to alter their initial strategy.
He must rescue Wu You’er first and ensure her safety.
Under these conditions, if he delayed further, even Wu You’er would not be saved! Let alone the Wu couple who were nowhere to be found.
Su Nantian now had a strong intuition that he must act this way. After making his decision, he would not wait any longer; he intended to infiltrate the Wu family that very night and locate Wu You’er’s position, rescuing her at all costs.
At this moment, Su Nantian had already begun to secretly plan his actions for the night.
Yet he was unaware that this decision, so painstakingly made, would be delayed by a step. All plans would be rendered futile and too late by the night.
This major disruption had completely derailed Su Nantian’s plans, and all his subsequent trials would begin from this night’s incident.
Unfortunately, Su Nantian lacked the ability to foresee the future and could not anticipate the impending crisis.
Otherwise, he would have taken preventive measures to neutralize the crisis just before it occurred.
At this moment, the previously bright sky was suddenly obscured by thick clouds, their dark mass pressing heavily, making it almost impossible to breathe.
Numerous birds flew low, their wings blending with the clouds, deepening the sky’s darkness. Dragonflies and various insects flitted about incessantly.
All these strange occurrences hinted that this night would be extraordinary.
Chapter 708: Applying for the Mission
“I cannot delay any longer.”
Su Nantian’s expression darkened slightly. Having made his decision, he did not waste time but returned to his room immediately.
He then, as before, carefully pried up the floorboards and retrieved the phone he had previously hidden. He then took out the phone, pressed the power button, and within a second, a call came in.
The number displayed was once again an unknown sequence of digits.
Su Nantian glanced at it and answered.
A slightly surprised voice immediately responded: “Hey? Master Tian? Why did you contact me so soon this time? Did you find something already?”
Dazhang asked as he spoke, his tone surprised.
“No.”
Su Nantian calmly uttered two words before pausing for a second and continuing: “I need to apply for a special mission.”
“A special mission?”
Upon hearing this, Dazhang was immediately surprised and exclaimed: “Master Tian, what do you plan to do?”
“What else could I do?”
Su Nantian let out a light laugh: “Simple. I wish to infiltrate the Wu family and rescue Wu You’er first.”
“What?”
Upon hearing Su Nantian’s words, Dazhang exclaimed again and immediately warned him: “No way, Master Tian. Have you forgotten? Your mission is not only to rescue Wu You’er but also her parents. If you take her now, it would be a mistake!”
Dazhang’s voice rose as he spoke, his tone filled with concern: “If this happens, Master Tian, your months of effort would be in vain! It would all be for nothing!”
Dazhang thought more and more about it, feeling deeply uneasy about Su Nantian’s risky “special mission.”
“But I cannot wait any longer!”
Su Nantian knew this well. He was aware Dazhang was reminding him, but when he thought of Wu You’er’s condition, he could not remain calm or sit idly by.
Su Nantian felt that every second spent here would mean another second of torment for Wu You’er. Thinking about her complete trust and reliance on him, he felt unbearable discomfort.
“Dazhang, I told you before, didn’t I? Wu You’er has a severe case of anorexia. Her current condition is extremely critical; if we do not act now, she may not survive.”
Su Nantian said this to Dazhang.
“Moreover, I have lost contact with her and do not know her current situation. Thus, I cannot sit idly by or ignore this!”
Su Nantian continued explaining, his mood deteriorating due to Wu You’er’s dangerous condition. His tone grew heavier, sounding somewhat impatient.
If it were not for the superiors’ instructions and his awareness of the rules, Su Nantian would have acted immediately without hesitation, rescuing Wu You’er at all costs.
“But Master Tian, you have worked so hard for half a year now!”
Upon hearing this, Dazhang paused slightly. He understood Su Nantian but felt more deeply that it was a pity for him.
Thus, Dazhang continued: “We are at the critical stage now! We cannot abandon our efforts at this crucial moment!”
Dazhang felt heartbroken. Even if Su Nantian did not think so, Dazhang could not help but feel for him.
Dazhang had always worked alongside Su Nantian, with one managing internal affairs and the other handling external tasks. Dazhang was primarily responsible for relaying information between Su Nantian and the superiors.
Thus, Dazhang understood this mission was extremely challenging, a test of endurance. He knew Su Nantian had invested much and worried greatly.
Because of this, Dazhang did not want Su Nantian to abandon his efforts due to a momentary emotion. It was for this reason that Dazhang had been trying so hard to persuade Su Nantian.
“No, there is no ‘but’.”
Su Nantian interrupted Dazhang’s advice with a cold tone, his voice carrying an unyielding determination.
“Dazhang, do not forget: this is the mission we are to undertake. Our primary objective has always been to ensure Wu You’er’s safety.”
Su Nantian spoke as he continued: “As for her parents, they were an added condition Wu You’er raised later. Thus, under these extreme circumstances, my first priority must be to ensure Wu You’er’s safety. Otherwise, everything is meaningless!”
If Wu You’er were harmed, this mission would be truly over. This was Su Nantian’s most critical concern and unrelated to anything else.
At this point, Su Nantian’s tone had grown colder and more resolute.
Upon hearing Su Nantian’s words, Dazhang felt they were reasonable. Yet he could not help but feel a sense of resentment at the idea that this long-anticipated mission would be disrupted by an unexpected incident.
“Master Tian, perhaps we should wait a little longer? Let us send some people in to gather information first. Perhaps then, we might find something.”
At this thought, Dazhang suddenly had an idea.
He still hoped Su Nantian would calm down and wait for more information.
“Think about it, Master Tian. There is less than a week until the wetland bidding.”
He paused and continued: “At that time, even if Wu You’er did not wish to appear, according to Wu Chuan’s habits, how could he allow her not to meet everyone? This was his initial goal!”
Dazhang argued logically while thinking internally.
Why would Wu Chuan not have taken over immediately after killing all those eligible to inherit the Wu family headship? Why go through such trouble, wasting so much time to capture Wu You’er and her family, threatening Wu You’er to inherit the headship?
Was it not because he wanted to maintain his remaining dignity and continue controlling the Wu family’s power? This was a double gain!
“Thus, Master Tian, perhaps we should wait a little longer? Just a few days.”
At this thought, Dazhang tried to persuade Su Nantian again: “Think about it. Wu You’er is so important to Wu Chuan, with such significance. How could he allow her to be harmed at this critical moment? Perhaps you are overthinking it, or maybe Wu Chuan is just playing tricks.”
Chapter 709: Application Approved
“Perhaps we should wait a little longer?”
Dazhang still attempted to persuade Su Nantian, hoping he would calm down.
He felt that Su Nantian was placing too much importance on Wu You’er, and this mission had become more emotionally invested than before.
“Master Tian, are you…?”
At this thought, Dazhang was immediately stunned. He seemed to have difficulty speaking and stopped after uttering the first half of his sentence.
Dazhang swallowed several times, calming himself before finally managing to say the second half: “Have you fallen for Wu You’er?”
Otherwise, Dazhang could not understand why Su Nantian was so determined about this mission.
“What are you talking about? Do your thoughts only revolve around such things?”
Su Nantian was startled by Dazhang’s line of thinking. He did not know how he had come to this conclusion.
“She is merely my mission target; I am clear about that.”
Su Nantian seemed to realize his words had been too emotional, so he took a deep breath and softened his tone. Yet Su Nantian truly wanted to know how Dazhang had come to this conclusion.
Even Nan Gong Ping’s unreliable idea was one thing, but why did Dazhang think this too?
“Not at all. I was just joking.”
Dazhang carefully swallowed, his voice hesitant as he realized his guess was too shocking. He quickly tried to correct himself.
Quickly, Dazhang returned to the topic: “Let’s get back on track, Master Tian. Since you have no intention of doing that with her, why are you so eager? Perhaps we should wait for more information?”
“No!”
Su Nantian immediately gave a negative answer, still resolute in his stance.
Every time he thought of what Lv Li had told him, he felt there were many complex secrets and dangers involved.
Indeed, Su Nantian had a strong intuition that if he did not act quickly to rescue Wu You’er, she might be harmed.
It was this strong intuition that had made him persist and specifically apply for a special mission.
Otherwise, he could have simply waited quietly, followed the plan step by step, and proceeded as originally planned. Why go to such trouble and constantly investigate information about the Wu family?
Wasn’t it because he wanted to confirm Wu You’er’s situation as soon as possible?
Thus, Su Nantian had already considered all these issues. Now the most critical thing was to go to the Wu family and find Wu You’er, at least confirming her safety.
At this thought, Su Nantian spoke again with a determined and resolute tone, clearly requesting Dazhang to help him apply for the special mission.
“Dazhang, listen to me.”
Su Nantian spoke, his voice calm as he told Dazhang: “I simply wish to check on Wu You’er and confirm her current condition. If she is safe, I will not rashly take her out but proceed with the original plan.”
This time, Su Nantian had taken a step back in front of Dazhang. His meaning was that if Wu You’er’s current condition was safe, he would not cause a disturbance and instead follow the original plan.
Upon hearing this, Dazhang understood that Su Nantian had taken a significant step back. Thus, he could not persuade further. Dazhang only sighed and agreed to Su Nantian: “Well, since you are so determined, I will help apply for it.”
After saying this, Dazhang immediately began to assist Su Nantian in applying for the special mission.
“Thank you, Dazhang.”
Su Nantian knew that Dazhang had always genuinely cared for him. He also understood that this decision of his was somewhat reckless and would make Dazhang unhappy.
But Su Nantian still insisted on his own thoughts.
With all these thoughts intertwined, he could only say a simple thank you to Dazhang.
“Hey! Master Tian! We have worked together so many times now; I have already considered you as one of my own. Why are you still being so polite with me?”
Upon hearing Su Nantian’s sincere thanks, Dazhang first felt a moment of bewilderment. But he quickly regained his composure and told Su Nantian:
“Master Tian, although I do not fully agree with your action, I am on your side. Whatever you request, I will try my best to fulfill.”
“Thank you, Dazhang.”
Upon hearing this, Su Nantian’s throat moved slightly. He remained silent for a moment before ultimately saying only one simple thank you.
After Su Nantian and Dazhang spoke, Dazhang immediately went to help apply for it. They discussed other matters briefly before hanging up the phone.
Su Nantian then followed his usual steps to conceal everything, leaving no traces or clues.
Now that all the necessary procedures were completed and night had fallen, Su Nantian did not waste time but immediately set out to infiltrate the Wu family and find Wu You’er.
Although the Wu family’s security was extremely strict, with 24-hour guards on duty, Su Nantian had become familiar with the Wu family’s structure over these days of accompanying Nan Gong Ping to negotiate with Wu Chuan.
Plus, the cover of night allowed him to carefully avoid the Wu family’s security personnel and save considerable time.
Thus, Su Nantian smoothly infiltrated the Wu family without being detected by anyone.
Su Nantian moved swiftly, like a ghost, and under the cover of night, he was at his most comfortable.
He moved like a gust of wind that passed swiftly without attracting anyone’s attention.
However, this was only the first step. Even after successfully infiltrating the Wu family, Su Nantian did not become complacent but remained more cautious.
After all, the Wu family was among the top three families in inland ports, with a vast and magnificent territory. Because of its large size, it increased the difficulty for Su Nantian to find Wu You’er.
Moreover, the Wu family had many servants; one careless mistake could lead to being discovered.
All these challenges added pressure and difficulty for Su Nantian in searching for her, but pressure was the catalyst for progress. Su Nantian would not give up due to such minor issues.
Su Nantian curled his lips into a smile, finding these challenges appealing.
Quickly, he suppressed all his thoughts and resumed earnestly searching for Wu You’er.
Chapter 710: Infiltrating the Wu Family
“Wu You’er, wait for me.”
Su Nantian gazed at the sky. He felt that this night’s darkness was like a gaping maw, ready to swallow him if he were careless.
This sudden thought was certainly not a good omen, so Su Nantian quickly forced himself to suppress it and focused entirely on finding Wu You’er.
Because Lv Li had previously mentioned the kitchen and Wu You’er’s recent return to eating, Su Nantian’s first target was the kitchen. Fortunately, his sense of smell was keen, and it was now dinner time; the aroma from the Wu family’s kitchen was rich. Thus, Su Nantian followed the scent of food and quickly found the Wu family’s kitchen.
Su Nantian carefully hid on the rooftop, observing the scene through a skylight with intense focus. Whether it was his good fortune or not, he had barely arrived when he overheard the kitchen staff discussing Wu You’er.
“Hey, what’s wrong with Miss Wu? She has been acting strangely lately?”
One plump cook whispered, expressing her confusion while looking at the other servants: “She hadn’t eaten for several days before, but now she suddenly demands five meals a day.”
“Indeed! She just had afternoon tea; it’s still early, and she already wants us to deliver dinner quickly. You know, how could Miss Wu become so hungry? She demands rich meals every time.”
Another servant immediately echoed the plump cook’s words, adding her thoughts: “It really is strange!”
“Ah! Why are you all so concerned?”
At this point, another servant interjected. He seemed to feel it was improper to discuss their master in secret, his expression becoming slightly uneasy.
“They are the masters; we are servants. Miss Wu’s desires and actions should be followed as instructed. We shouldn’t interfere! Be careful not to let Master Li hear.”
This servant, upon hearing their discussion, immediately interjected with concern. He advised them while cautiously scanning the surroundings, fearing being caught by Master Li.
“Hmph! I can’t even say a word without trouble? After all, no one else is here. If you don’t speak and I don’t speak, who would know?”
The plump cook immediately frowned in annoyance, feeling the other’s words were meddling.
“I….”
The well-meaning servant felt委屈, thinking his good intentions had been met with ingratitude. It was like a dog biting Lu Dongbin, not recognizing kindness.
