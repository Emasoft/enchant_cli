It was precisely because Yuan Xiong had delayed his arrival that he had to return midway, recalling that Su Nantian was quite formidable. Thus, he turned back to summon several department heads to bolster his presence.

Yuan Xiong and the group of department leaders were already middle-aged men with round bellies. After this run, they all struggled to catch their breath. At the entrance, they inquired about the situation and took several moments to recover.

Upon entering the classroom, these men were startled by Shen Fei lying motionless on the floor. The ground was littered with broken desks and scattered textbooks, while other students had huddled together in fear. Yuan Xiong immediately widened his small eyes to search the crowd for Su Nantian's figure.

In Yuan Xiong's mind, Su Nantian would surely be hiding among the crowd to minimize his presence.

Yet after scanning the room repeatedly, he discovered Su Nantian resting calmly beside the fallen desk.

Yuan Xiong's face furrowed in worry. Su Nantian's patron was Gao Qingyun, one of the school's founders. He wasn't someone who could be provoked; he was simply too afraid to provoke anyone, even entertaining no thoughts of confrontation. He longed to revere Gao Qingyun.

Although Shen Fei's patron was not as influential as Gao Qingyun, Yuan Xiong knew he could not afford to offend him either. Just before the semester began, the Shen family had sent Yuan Xiong a modest gift and instructed him to care for Shen Fei properly.

If this matter could not provide the Shen family with a suitable explanation, they would surely turn against him.

But it was Su Nantian who had provoked Shen Fei. No matter how this situation was handled, it would inevitably fail to provide the Shen family with a satisfactory resolution.

Yuan Xiong's round, doughy face twisted in distress. He extended his thick fingers and pointed at Shen Fei lying on the floor: “Dead... dead?”

Zhu Ying's lips twitched. “No, he still has a pulse.”

“Where is the ambulance? Why hasn't it arrived yet!” Yuan Xiong's round, doughy face looked on the verge of tears. He anxiously patted his thighs.

Zhu Ying quickly reassured him: “We've been on the phone for a while now. It should be arriving shortly.”

As Zhu Ying's words finished, an ambulance's distinct sound approached from the distance. Zhu Ying rushed to the window in the corridor and opened it, spotting an ambulance parked beneath the classroom building.

Zhu Ying hurriedly called out to the students in the classroom: “It's here! The ambulance is coming!”

Below, the ambulance had just come to a stop. Zhu Ying checked her phone's time; the ambulance had arrived exactly twenty minutes after she entered the classroom.

Moments later, the ambulance's rear door swung open. Medical staff carried a stretcher and medical equipment, rushing toward the stairs with urgency.

“Move aside! Let us through!” The paramedics pushed past students blocking the staircase, darting and dodging toward the upper floor. Zhu Ying hurried to meet them, fearing they might get lost and waste time.

She could not afford to be careless. Even in high heels, she ran with all her might. As she descended a few steps, she collided head-on with the paramedics carrying the stretcher. Zhu Ying immediately took charge of guiding them.

“Come on, this way!” Zhu Ying led the paramedics through a maze of corridors into the classroom.

Once everyone arrived at the classroom, Zhu Ying noticed Yuan Xiong had already expelled all the students. The room was now eerily empty, littered with overturned desks and chairs. He Wei still sat on the floor cradling Shen Fei's head, while school leaders surrounded the two, scrutinizing them from all angles. Glancing at Su Nantian, he remained seated on a chair, feigning sleep.

Seeing Zhu Ying with the paramedics, the school leaders quickly made space for them to perform emergency care.

Shen Fei's unconscious state shocked everyone, making them believe Su Nantian had nearly killed him without mercy.

But only Su Nantian knew Shen Fei's current condition was due to excessive fear and shock. Having never been struck before, he could not withstand it, leaving him in a coma.

“You all step aside,” the paramedics urgently examined Shen Fei. He had multiple internal injuries and minor fractures; further checks would be needed at the hospital.

After informing Yuan Xiong of Shen Fei's condition, the paramedics swiftly placed him on the stretcher and hurried toward the ambulance.

Yuan Xiong watched the ambulance prepare to depart. He rushed to call one of the school leaders, requesting they accompany Shen Fei to the hospital.

After sending Shen Fei off, Yuan Xiong's tense expression darkened. He lifted his eyes to glance at Su Nantian, letting out a grumble.

“You all come with me to the office!” Yuan Xiong saw Su Nantian still feigning sleep and boldly barked at him. As soon as he finished speaking, Su Nantian opened his eyes and met Yuan Xiong's gaze. Yuan Xiong immediately turned away, avoiding Su Nantian’s eyes.

Su Nantian stood up and stretched lazily, as if he had rested well. Zhu Ying, in front of Yuan Xiong, dared not say anything about Su Nantian. Yuan Xiong himself was too afraid to reprimand him, so he only let out another grumble of discontent.

Then Yuan Xiong shook his hands and led the way out of the classroom, barking at the students outside: “What are you looking at? Which class are you from!”

Yuan Xiong's long-held frustration burst forth. The onlookers scattered in panic.

Feeling he had regained some dignity, Yuan Xiong glanced at Zhu Ying and the others, signaling them to follow. He strode ahead with his round belly.

Zhu Ying sighed and followed Su Nantian behind the school leaders, heading to the principal's office.

Although Yuan Xiong was untidy, his office was cleaned daily. However, upon entering the fifty-square-meter room, Zhu Ying and Su Nantian all caught a whiff of the pungent mix of foot odor and smoke. Their brows furrowed.

Chapter 158: Tea

Zhu Ying muttered under her breath, “Why is it so smelly?”

Yuan Xiong was accustomed to his office environment. He remained unaffected, sitting on a swivel chair with the air of a principal, glaring at Zhu Ying and Su Nantian before the desk.

Zhu Ying felt uneasy; after all, they were both students in her class.

In contrast, Su Nantian stood with his hands in his pockets, calm and composed as if nothing had happened.

Yuan Xiong had a lot of anger but dared not vent it at Su Nantian. He asked Zhu Ying, “What exactly happened?”

Zhu Ying knew she was involved and explained everything clearly to Yuan Xiong.

After hearing her account, Yuan Xiong rubbed his head. Even the accompanying school leaders were considering how to handle this matter.

“I’ve heard enough. I’ll discuss it with the leadership. You can go back, Teacher Zhu, and check on Shen Fei at the hospital,” Yuan Xiong said dismissively, sending Zhu Ying away.

After Zhu Ying left, Yuan Xiong took a deep breath and continued discussing with the other leaders.

After a long while, Su Nantian grew impatient: “Have you decided yet?”

Su Nantian had said nothing throughout, but his first words were like a bomb dropped into the crowd. Yuan Xiong and the other leaders immediately stopped talking, their faces etched with worry.

Yuan Xiong wanted to say something but hesitated due to the presence of other leaders, unwilling to be too direct.

In the end, this discussion yielded nothing useful for Yuan Xiong.

“Everyone else can go back. I’ll personally educate this troublemaker,” Yuan Xiong decided to send them off, thinking their presence in the office was useless. He said it aloud.

The leaders found it uncomfortable to stay in Yuan Xiong’s office, where the stench of wooden nails was impossible to remove. Their ages had also caught up with them, and they could not endure the environment. Now that Yuan Xiong had asked them to leave, they took the opportunity and returned to their respective offices.

Yuan Xiong stood up from his desk, escorted the leaders to the door, and then locked it behind them.

A moment later, only Su Nantian and Yuan Xiong remained in the room.

From the moment he entered, Su Nantian had smelled the strange odor and had already sealed his nose. Now that everyone else had left, he took a few steps toward the window and pushed open two glass panes. Fresh air immediately flooded into the room.

Su Nantian inhaled the fresh air twice before turning to glance at Yuan Xiong.

Seeing Su Nantian open the window, he remembered that in the afternoon he had removed his shoes to smoke. His face flushed with embarrassment.

But compared to the current matter, these were trivial concerns.

Yuan Xiong quickly gestured for Su Nantian to sit on the black leather sofa in front of the tea table.

Su Nantian raised an eyebrow, following Yuan Xiong’s guidance to sit down. Yuan Xiong then attempted to sit beside Su Nantian but was met with a glance from Su Nantian that made him hesitate and sit across from him instead.

As Yuan Xiong’s heavy body sank into the leather sofa, it creaked as if protesting. But Yuan Xiong paid no heed.

“My ancestor!” he exclaimed anxiously.

Su Nantian laughed. “I don’t recall having such a grandson.”

Yuan Xiong was taken aback by Su Nantian’s remark, smiling awkwardly. “No, how can you still have time to joke with me? You’ve caused such a big mess. Don’t you feel anxious at all?”

Su Nantian raised an eyebrow, his face clearly showing he felt no anxiety. He glanced at the tea table and noticed a pot of fine tea, so he took it and twisted the lid. With a “pop,” the tea can was opened.

A strange aroma of tea immediately drifted out. He was slightly surprised and leaned in to sniff it carefully.

This leisurely behavior of Su Nantian’s distressed Yuan Xiong greatly.

“Do you want to drink tea? Well, I’ll go and brew it for you,” Yuan Xiong said, reaching for the tea can. Su Nantian sidestepped and avoided Yuan Xiong’s fat hand.

Under Su Nantian’s gaze, Yuan Xiong hesitated. “This tea is excellent; it's good tea. You know, tea can detoxify, right?”

Yuan Xiong was taken aback and nodded: “Ah... I do know that…”

Su Nantian continued, “This tea can detoxify your body.”

Yuan Xiong’s eyes lit up. He immediately grabbed the tea can, examining it like a treasure. His joy was evident.

“Ah! This tea was brought back by my wife from Yunnan today!” Yuan Xiong’s plump body could no longer sit still.

“Since it has medicinal properties, I can’t afford to waste it. Wait a moment; I’ll go and brew the tea!”

He said this, then took the teapot and happily went to the water heater. As he stood up, Su Nantian glanced at the sofa, which had already been indented by Yuan Xiong’s weight.

Su Nantian shook his head in disdain. Such a person, when their personal interests were at stake, would disregard even the most significant matters.

The room was suddenly filled with Yuan Xiong’s uncontrollable laughter and the sound of water gushing from the water heater.

Yuan Xiong quickly filled the teapot with hot water. His plump body sank back into the indentation, and he smiled at Su Nantian. His small eyes were further obscured by his facial fat.

Su Nantian suddenly thought Yuan Xiong’s wife must have had poor eyesight; otherwise, who else would find him attractive.

“Student Su, let’s brew some tea and talk while we drink,” Yuan Xiong said with a fawning smile. A man who was usually clumsy now skillfully brewed the tea.

This sight left Su Nantian speechless. It seemed the principal was indeed a leisurely position; this man must have spent his free time perfecting tea art, otherwise he wouldn’t be so skilled.

At that moment, a set of expensive teaware was placed on the tea table—various sizes of teapots and cups were all present.

Chapter 159: Can’t Be Provoked?

Yuan Xiong lifted the blue-and-white porcelain teapot and poured boiling water into the gongbei to brew the tea. A stream of steam immediately rose from the spout to the gongbei, and soon, the tea aroma gradually spread from the gongbei.

After rinsing the tea, Yuan Xiong handed a freshly brewed cup to Su Nantian. Su Nantian took it, sniffed the nose, and found it to be a genuine aroma. The brewing temperature and time were just right.

Su Nantian placed the teacup on the tea table without drinking it.

“You didn’t expect me to be so fond of life,” Su Nantian said.

It was unclear whether Yuan Xiong understood the sarcasm in Su Nantian’s words. He simply drank the tea in one go, emitting a satisfied sound.

Then he smiled at Su Nantian: “Student Su, you misunderstood. I brewed this tea so carefully because you said it had medicinal properties.”

Yuan Xiong refilled his cup and drank it in one go.

“Let’s talk about the matter at hand,” he said, continuously refilling and drinking tea.

Su Nantian frowned and tapped the table with his fingers. Yuan Xiong’s attention was immediately drawn to the sound.

“Speak properly, or I’ll leave first,” Su Nantian said coldly.

Yuan Xiong quickly placed the half-drunk tea back on the table and immediately adopted an anxious expression toward Su Nantian.

“Speak, speak! You must speak!” Yuan Xiong emphasized his urgency by patting his thighs with his thick hands.

The collision of fat against fat produced a clear sound.

Yuan Xiong had not noticed he used too much force, and his round face immediately crumpled.

Su Nantian could no longer bear Yuan Xiong’s clownish behavior and prepared to leave.

Yuan Xiong perceived Su Nantian's movement and quickly stood up, gently supporting Su Nantian’s shoulder to calm him back onto the sofa. He also secretly rubbed his leg's fat before sitting down.

“You see, you’ve already caused so much trouble since your first day here. What kind of matters are these…” Yuan Xiong said with a pained expression.

“You’ve already provoked Xu Wenhao, Yuan Ouming, and now Shen Fei!” Yuan Xiong spoke with a red face and neck, as if Su Nantian’s provocations would lead to retaliation from these people.

“Those three are not people you can provoke so easily! You’ve provoked three at once!”

But Su Nantian, sitting across from Yuan Xiong, showed no reaction.

“Ancestor, are you afraid the school won’t know your fame?” Yuan Xiong continued with a painful expression.

But Su Nantian still showed no reaction.

Yuan Xiong could not hold back and pleaded: “Even if you are strong, you don’t want to leave them any chance of survival. Please at least spare me a path to survive!”

Yuan Xiong looked as if he were about to cry.

“You shouldn’t have targeted the tough ones. Why not learn from smart people? Soft peaches are much easier to crush!”

Su Nantian disdainfully glanced at Yuan Xiong but said nothing. He then took a sip of the tea that had gone cold.

Yuan Xiong saw Su Nantian’s demeanor and guessed he was unaware of the identities of those he had provoked, hence his nonchalance. So Yuan Xiong bent down awkwardly and searched through a drawer under the tea table.

Su Nantian sat across from him, sipping his tea. He heard a rustling sound from Yuan Xiong’s side.

After a moment, Yuan Xiong pulled out a pile of documents and slammed them onto the tea table. A cloud of dust rose.

Su Nantian frowned, waving his hand in front of his nose. The dust immediately dispersed.

Yuan Xiong smiled awkwardly at Su Nantian and continued searching through the documents.

After a while, Yuan Xiong pulled out three brochures and placed them in front of Su Nantian, pointing at them.

Su Nantian glanced at the items on the table and realized they were merely brochures of people.

He recognized them as Shen Fei, Xu Wenhao, and Yuan Ouming. Su Nantian became interested; he wanted to know what substantial background had produced these three bullies.

Su Nantian extended his long fingers, picked up Shen Fei’s brochure, and casually glanced at it before placing it aside. He then took Xu Wenhao’s brochure, again glancing casually before setting it down.

Yuan Xiong was now truly anxious. He had expected that showing these three people’s brochures would make Su Nantian realize the strength of those he had provoked, and thus he might temper his reckless attitude.

But Su Nantian merely glanced at them before setting them down, as if they were trivial matters.

Yuan Xiong then took Yuan Ouming’s brochure and held it up for Su Nantian to see.

“You look, you look. The three people you’ve provoked have formidable backgrounds. Especially Yuan Ouming!”

Su Nantian suddenly remembered something and asked, “I’ve never heard of the Yuan Ouming family. Why are you all so nervous?”

Yuan Xiong sighed and slapped his thigh: “Although the Yuan Ouming family doesn’t have much power in Fengcheng, their clan has absolute control over the north. They are true local emperors. Yuan Ouming merely came to Fengcheng for university, so the family didn’t station many forces in Fengcheng. Who would have thought!”

As he spoke, Yuan Xiong glanced at Su Nantian secretly. Although Su Nantian was calmly sipping tea, he dared not scold him. Even speaking loudly would fear Su Nantian’s raised eyebrows.

Then Yuan Xiong whispered: “Yuan Ouming also has an older brother named… Yuan Shoucheng!”

“Yuan Shoucheng is no small person. He joined the mysterious Dragon Group at a young age and has become one of the youngest core members within it! You know what a core member means, right!”

Yuan Xiong said angrily: “You’ve beaten his brother. Yuan Shoucheng will definitely retaliate against you. Yuan Shoucheng’s background isn’t just the Yuan family; it also includes the mysterious Dragon Group.”

Yuan Xiong sighed: “I don’t know if Mr. Gao can handle this matter well. Even I might be caught in the crossfire.”

Su Nantian’s eyebrows lifted. In any world, it was the strong who spoke, and truth was determined by people. Yuan Xiong had lived half his life without understanding this truth, and he was truly living like a dog.

Su Nantian wasn’t worried about Yuan Shoucheng coming to trouble him. He simply thought that if Yuan Shoucheng was in such a high position, he shouldn’t have sacrificed his career for such a useless brother.

Chapter 160: Yuan Shoucheng

Suddenly, he became interested and asked with curiosity, “Yuan Ouming is currently at the third level of cultivation. Since Yuan Shoucheng is a core member of the mysterious Dragon Group, what level would he be? He must not be too low.”

Yuan Xiong, hearing Su Nantian’s question, rubbed his chin with his small hands and pondered for a while before saying, “I don’t know… but he must be very strong!”

Su Nantian nodded in satisfaction. He was currently hard to find an opponent, and he hoped Yuan Shoucheng wouldn’t disappoint him.

But Yuan Xiong’s small eyes narrowed as he thought about Yuan Shoucheng, and his thoughts seemed to drift with the tea mist.

“This Yuan Shoucheng is truly a formidable character…”

Su Nantian was intrigued and began to listen carefully as Yuan Xiong explained how formidable Yuan Shoucheng was.

Yuan Xiong’s small eyes narrowed, showing a sense of admiration. Su Nantian found it amusing but didn’t laugh out loud. He lowered his head and tapped the table lightly, bringing Yuan Xiong back to reality.

Yuan Xiong was startled and immediately sat up straight, recounting the strengths of Yuan Shoucheng to Su Nantian.

“This Yuan family has always been renowned in the north. It’s not for any other reason, but this family is full of talent. Whether it's innate or cultivated later, their children are always formidable at a young age,” Yuan Xiong said.

Su Nantian nodded in agreement. This was evident from Yuan Ouming’s case; a young man at the third level of cultivation, although it was nothing to Su Nantian. But in this world with scarce spiritual energy resources, such strength at his age was already outstanding.

Yuan Xiong felt that Su Nantian had finally responded to him, so he spoke more passionately about Yuan Shoucheng.

“Among the younger generation of this family, Yuan Shoucheng is the most formidable. I’ve heard he was unbeatable in single combat since childhood.”

Single combat.

Su Nantian raised an eyebrow. If that was his level, there wasn’t much to expect.

“Later, when Yuan Shoucheng grew up, the family head sent him somewhere. I heard that while other children were playing, he had already started his harsh training,” Yuan Xiong said.

At this point, Yuan Xiong became even more excited: “Yuan Shoucheng was hidden for so many years. When he returned to the family, the head of the family immediately announced that he would be the next patriarch. And with his own strength, he defeated all those who opposed him.”

Hearing this, Su Nantian slightly relaxed his brows. It must be said that Yuan Shoucheng had some talent.

Yuan Xiong continued: “Later, he entered the most mysterious organization in China: the Dragon Group.”

“Do you know what the Dragon Group is? It's a mysterious organization with great fame in China!”

Su Nantian didn’t care about the Dragon Group or Snake Group at all.

“Yuan Shoucheng, before joining the family, his strength was already formidable. Later, he obtained secret techniques from the Dragon Group and his strength became immeasurable,” Yuan Xiong said, making a sound with his lips.

“Those who have seen Yuan Shoucheng’s skills say that his strength is terrifying!”

“How terrifying?” Su Nantian asked.

Yuan Xiong hadn’t seen Yuan Shoucheng himself, so he couldn’t explain how terrifying it was. But from his hearsay, Yuan Xiong recited two statements.

“That Yuan Shoucheng is so terrifying—I haven’t seen it myself. But I heard that during his years in the Dragon Group, he participated in multiple field missions.”

“Each time Yuan Shoucheng completed his mission perfectly. According to others, there were no mistakes at all; it was a miracle among the younger generation of the Dragon Group.”

“Yuan Shoucheng earned great achievements over the years, and his influence in the Dragon Group was considerable.”

Yuan Xiong finished speaking and took a sip of his tea.

“Over the years, Yuan Shoucheng’s influence from the Dragon Group to the north has been considerable.”

“But you’ve beaten Yuan Shoucheng’s brother…”

Su Nantian had already lost interest in Yuan Shoucheng's story when Yuan Xiong was halfway through.

A very cliché story, where the protagonist climbed to the top with his indomitable will. Plus, there were surely exaggerated elements in Yuan Xiong's storytelling. Su Nantian had already figured out the gist halfway through and didn’t want to listen further.

But Yuan Xiong had just reached the key point. He had said a thousand and one things to make Su Nantian alert.

Now, however, Su Nantian was busily brewing tea in his cup. Yuan Xiong was so desperate he wanted to hit Su Nantian.

“Did you hear what I said? This Yuan family has such a strong background and power. You’ve provoked Yuan Ouming, and the family will definitely retaliate against you.”

“If Yuan Ouming goes to his brother and reports, his brother will surely come back to avenge his brother. Are you really not afraid?”

Su Nantian, sitting on the sofa, was a bit sleepy. He only rubbed his nose and said slowly: “Not afraid.”

Yuan Xiong sighed again, took up the tea cup and drank it in one go. This ancestor was truly fearless.

After Yuan Xiong finished his tea, a sudden idea struck him. He reminded Su Nantian: “There's also Xu Wenhao…”

“Did I beat him?” Su Nantian asked, unsure.

Yuan Xiong wiped his forehead and nodded: “You did. It was the one you beat in the Taekwondo club.”

Su Nantian actually went through his mind, sorting out the people he had met in the past two days. He realized there was such a person. So Su Nantian nodded, signaling Yuan Xiong to continue.

“This Xu Wenhao isn’t as powerful as Yuan Ouming, but his influence in our school is no ordinary person.”

“Xu Wenhao is a member of the Taekwondo club. He himself is also a rich second-generation who spends his parents’ money freely, so over the years, most of the Taekwondo club’s funds have been invested by Xu Wenhao.”

“Oh?” Su Nantian found it amusing. “So you mean Xu Wenhao is the Taekwondo club’s money-making machine.”

Yuan Xiong was caught off guard by Su Nantian's remark but couldn’t find a way to refute him. The saying was crude, but Xu Wenhao truly was that kind of identity.

Chapter 161: Just a Spoiled Brat

“Did you hear what I said? This Yuan family has such a strong background and power. You’ve provoked Yuan Ouming, and the family will definitely retaliate against you.”

“If Yuan Ouming goes to his brother and reports, his brother will surely come back to avenge his brother. Are you really not afraid?”

Su Nantian, sitting on the sofa, was a bit sleepy. He only rubbed his nose and said slowly: “Not afraid.”

Yuan Xiong sighed again, took up the tea cup and drank it in one go. This ancestor was truly fearless.

After Yuan Xiong finished his tea, a sudden idea struck him. He reminded Su Nantian: “There's also Xu Wenhao…”

“Did I beat him?” Su Nantian asked, unsure.

Yuan Xiong wiped his forehead and nodded: “You did. It was the one you beat in the Taekwondo club.”

Su Nantian actually went through his mind, sorting out the people he had met in the past two days. He realized there was such a person. So Su Nantian nodded, signaling Yuan Xiong to continue.

“This Xu Wenhao isn’t as powerful as Yuan Ouming, but his influence in our school is no ordinary person.”

“Xu Wenhao is a member of the Taekwondo club. He himself is also a rich second-generation who spends his parents’ money freely, so over the years, most of the Taekwondo club’s funds have been invested by Xu Wenhao.”

“Oh?” Su Nantian found it amusing. “So you mean Xu Wenhao is the Taekwondo club’s money-making machine.”

Yuan Xiong was caught off guard by Su Nantian's remark but couldn’t find a way to refute him. The saying was crude, but Xu Wenhao truly was that kind of identity.

Yuan Xiong could only agree: “That’s right. Now you know, you’ve beaten the Taekwondo club's money-making machine.”

Su Nantian feigned confusion and asked, “You are the principal of this school, Yuan Xiong. Can’t you control the Taekwondo club?”

Yuan Xiong understood Su Nantian's sarcasm and grumbled: “You are also a student of this school. Do you think I can control you?”

Su Nantian glanced at Yuan Xiong, and Yuan Xiong immediately added loudly: “These aren’t the main points. The important thing is, you’ve beaten his money-making machine. The Taekwondo club’s leader, Long Huyan, will definitely come after you.”

“Then you’ll be sandwiched between two fronts—no, three!”

Su Nantian waved his hand and said carelessly: “I did it, I’ll take responsibility. Don’t bother yourself with my matters.”

Yuan Xiong was stuck, unsure what else to say to make Su Nantian understand. He just silently watched Su Nantian, his face complex.

Su Nantian didn’t care about Yuan Xiong’s feelings. He calmly sipped his tea, and when it cooled, he refilled it.

Yuan Xiong felt some resentment. Su Nantian didn’t let him drink tea, but he himself drank more and more.

The two sat in silence for a while, each with their own thoughts. Su Nantian said: “If there’s nothing else, I’ll leave first.” He was about to get up from the sofa.

Yuan Xiong hadn’t yet explained everything clearly, fearing that this person still didn’t understand the severity of the situation. Once he left the office, who knew how many more troubles he would cause.

So Yuan Xiong became anxious. He was desperate for something to use, first calming Su Nantian down and then educating him.

Yuan Xiong anxiously thought, suddenly realizing a lifeline. He grabbed Shen Fei’s brochure from the tea table and said to Su Nantian: “Since you don’t care about those two, what about Shen Fei!”

Su Nantian said nothing but his eyes still showed disdain.

Yuan Xiong, in a rush, pulled Su Nantian to sit down and hurriedly handed Shen Fei’s brochure to him, urging him to look carefully. He wanted Su Nantian to realize how dangerous Shen Fei was.

Su Nantian sighed. He secretly shook his head; this Yuan Xiong must have a hole in his brain. If he hadn’t even taken Yuan Shoucheng seriously, would he worry about a child?

Yuan Xiong quickly leaned over from Su Nantian’s side and grabbed his shirt collar.

Su Nantian's brows furrowed. “Let go.”

Yuan Xiong was startled and quickly released his hand, rubbing his nose and saying: “I’m doing this for your own good. You just entered the academy, and you don’t know much about people. I brought you here today to remind you.”

Yuan Xiong sighed: “You’ll understand the benefits and harms later. You won’t act so recklessly.”

After saying this, Yuan Xiong muttered another sentence: “It would also reduce the trouble I have.”

This sentence was said quietly, but Yuan Xiong thought Su Nantian wouldn’t hear it. However, since Su Nantian was strong and had sharp hearing, he heard it clearly.

Su Nantian glared at him. “Spit it out quickly, I have things to do.”

Yuan Xiong cleared his throat and took Shen Fei’s brochure from the tea table, explaining to Su Nantian.

“This Shen Fei is different from the previous two. He’s a true spoiled brat.”

“Spoiled brat?” Su Nantian asked: “A spoiled brat, and you’re so scared. I don’t know how you became the principal.”

“Yes, it’s a lesson,” Yuan Xiong said after being questioned. He first hesitated but then quickly explained.

Drip, drip, Yuan Xiong kept talking. A spoiled brat was described so vividly it seemed like a story of how a spoiled brat was made. Yuan Xiong’s words were so engaging that it would be a waste for him to not write novels.

After listening, Su Nantian rubbed his ears. He couldn’t bear it anymore.

Yuan Xiong saw Su Nantian’s annoyed expression and felt very anxious. He was afraid that these people would come after him, and he wouldn’t be able to explain himself.

“Su Nantian, I told you this for your own good. Why won’t you listen?”

“Su Nantian, do you think I want to waste so much time talking to you?”

Yuan Xiong saw Su Nantian’s attitude and became even more angry, his voice rising unintentionally.

But after speaking, Yuan Xiong immediately realized his mistake. This young man was not someone he could provoke. Even a student with some status in the school wasn’t someone he could shout at.

In short, he was a puppet. As long as he took care of all aspects properly, he could continue being a puppet and remain the principal, living comfortably every day.

He secretly glanced at Su Nantian as if he hadn’t heard the previous words, calmly pouring tea into his cup.

The office suddenly became quiet. Only the sound of pouring tea could be heard.

Drip, drip.
