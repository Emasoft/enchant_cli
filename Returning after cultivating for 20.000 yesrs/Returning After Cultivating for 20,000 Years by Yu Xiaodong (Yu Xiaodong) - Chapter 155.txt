Ahao let out another cold snort, glaring at Su Nantian with a warning look.

Then Ahao made a gesture to his several brothers, a signal they used in daily life, one only they understood.

Ahao's previous gesture had meant for them to reveal their weapons.

This was usually how they intimidated multiple opponents, but today they were facing Su Nantian alone and had to reveal all their weapons.

Yet, having lost face before Su Nantian, they now aimed to subdue him.

After all, with their family background, even if a death occurred, they could easily handle it without worry.

After thinking this through, they all nodded and placed their hands at their waists.

Su Nantian had initially been puzzled by their actions, but upon seeing the position of their hands, he quickly understood.

He chuckled inwardly, thinking these people truly resorted to any underhanded methods. Yet this very fact proved they were now afraid of him.

Even if these people drew weapons, Su Nantian felt no fear.

He would let them know the fate of those who offended him and bullied the villagers of Xiaoyu.

After clarifying his thoughts, Su Nantian's gaze grew more resolute, and he met their eyes with an imposing presence.

The bullies were taken aback by Su Nantian's gaze, but quickly regained courage upon feeling their weapons at their sides.

"Go! This time we must give him a harsh lesson!"

Ahao issued another command, and they默契ly drew their weapons, rushing toward Su Nantian.

Their weapons were uniform small daggers, radiating a chilling sharpness.

"Hmph! Trivial tricks!"

Su Nantian snorted coldly, unafraid.

He continued evading their attacks, seizing their small daggers and tossing them behind him.

At that moment, one of them attempted to sneak up from behind to ambush Su Nantian. However, Su Nantian sensed the intent immediately.

The front attackers also saw through the ambush and deliberately kept Su Nantian occupied, preventing him from focusing.

Just as Su Nantian thought he would be cut, something within him seemed to release, instantly sending the ambush attacker flying.

Not only was he not harmed, but the man couldn't even approach before being thrown away.

"Whew—"

"What in the world is happening?"

Ahao and his gang had thought they were certain to win, ready to teach Su Nantian a lesson. Yet this unexpected turn left them bewildered.

They had all surrounded Su Nantian without seeing him act against the one behind, yet that man was thrown away as if repelled by something.

The fallen man groaned in agony immediately.

Chapter 775: Warning

"Did he really fly?"

They regarded Su Nantian with renewed fear.

"Who are you exactly?"

Only now did these bullies realize Su Nantian was no ordinary person.

But upon thinking further, they reasoned: if Su Nantian were truly a common villager, how could he dare provoke them?

"You have quite the ability. Why not join us? I'll make you my enforcer," Ahao, having failed to teach Su Nantian a lesson, now sought another approach.

"You must also be from the nearby village, right? This place is so poor it's barren. I see you have no money either. If you follow us, we'll ensure you eat and drink well, earning more than you could dream of in your lifetime."

The others also looked down on Su Nantian arrogantly.

What good was fighting ability if his identity was just a poor vagrant?

He was different from them, born with golden spoons!

Thus, they lifted their chins again, looking at Su Nantian arrogantly, already imagining how to humiliate him if he agreed.

"Is that really such a good deal?"

Su Nantian didn't immediately refuse but spoke meaningfully.

Ahao and his gang thought Su Nantian was tempted, exchanged glances with a knowing smile, then told him: "Of course it's real. Just obey me well, and the money I give you will exceed your imagination."

Ahao spoke for the other bullies, adding: "Moreover, we always keep our word."

After all, money wasn't an issue for them.

But once Su Nantian followed them, how they would humiliate and torment him depended on their mood.

Su Nantian then coldly replied: "But I'm truly uninterested in serving scum, and I don't want to."

"What? You called us scum?"

Ahao's veins bulged, his fists clenched tightly, glaring at Su Nantian with hatred.

"Yes, I called you scum. That's exactly what you are."

The villagers of Xiaoyu had it hard enough, yet these people took pleasure in bullying them. How could Su Nantian give them a good face?

At this moment, Su Nantian coldly spoke those words and decided not to play any more games with them.

He had only wanted to test these bullies' limits, learn their secrets.

Now it was clear this was unnecessary; he would end it quickly before they could recover.

Su Nantian's speed exceeded everyone's expectations; they hadn't even seen his movements before being unable to fight back.

After subduing them, Su Nantian swiftly pulled their belts and tied their hands behind their backs, making them sit in a circle.

When Su Nantian finished this action, the bullies were stunned and still hadn't recovered.

It wasn't until Su Nantian stepped on Ahao's leg that they realized.

"What are you doing! Do you know who we are?!"

The tied bullies, upon recovering, stared fearfully at Su Nantian. They now knew his true strength—how could they have been tied up without even realizing it?

At this thought, they all regarded Su Nantian with fear, unsure of what to do.

Su Nantian then brushed dust from his hands and coldly threatened: "I don't know, and I don't care."

He paused, gazing meaningfully at them before continuing: "Now the stage is mine. Don't speak unless I ask, or you'll suffer."

Though this sentence wasn't particularly threatening, it sounded malicious, leaving them unable to resist.

Ahao and his gang had wanted to curse Su Nantian further, but upon meeting his gaze, they dared not utter a single word.

They hung their heads, sitting quietly and making no sound.

"How long have you been intimidating the villagers?"

Su Nantian asked calmly, but no one answered.

Yet Su Nantian wasn't worried; he had anticipated their resistance.

But it didn't matter, for Su Nantian had already planned his response.

At this thought, he slightly increased the pressure on Ahao's foot, and Ahao immediately screamed.

"Ah! I'll tell you!"

Ahao's scream continued, answering: "Two or three years."

He trembled as he spoke, his voice distorted, face contorted in pain.

"Two or three years? Hmph, you've exceeded my expectations."

Su Nantian heard this and let out another cold laugh.

It seemed these bullies had tormented the Xiaoyu villagers for a long time. At this thought, Su Nantian's expression darkened further.

These people were already afraid of Su Nantian, and now seeing his expression turn dark, they were even more fearful.

They all held their breath, afraid to make a sound.

"Speak up. How much did you steal from them over the years? And what else did you take? I'll give you three days to return everything,"

Su Nantian continued, his face cold and tone even colder.

"Ah, this, we've forgotten! How can we return it?"

The bullies, upon hearing Su Nantian's command, were stunned and didn't know what to do.

They had stolen for fun; how could they remember what they stole or who they took it from?

Su Nantian's demand was clearly impossible!

The bullies grew more worried, their faces darkening further.

"Can't you do it?"

Su Nantian raised an eyebrow, speaking softly again. He increased the pressure on Ahao's foot, and Ahao let out a pig-like scream.

This time, the pressure was clearly much stronger; Ahao's bones made sounds, his face turned red, and his body trembled uncontrollably.

Su Nantian didn't care. He knew these people deserved their fate for doing such things.

If they had the courage to act, why not have the courage to atone?

Chapter 776: A Single Warning

There's no such thing as a free lunch in this world!

At this thought, Su Nantian's expression darkened again, and he increased the pressure on Ahao's foot, crushing it. Ahao screamed again, writhing in pain.

"We'll return it! We'll return it!"

Seeing Ahao beaten like this, the others dared not say anything else and quickly affirmed, fearing they would be next.

"That's right; cooperating early saves you from more pain."

Su Nantian nodded in satisfaction upon hearing this, then said: "If you can't remember, just don't be stingy. Remember the three days; if you don't follow my orders, I'll find each of you and beat you thoroughly."

Su Nantian issued a threat, then calmly scanned their eyes.

His gaze was very calm, devoid of much emotion or threat, but upon meeting his gaze, they all believed Su Nantian wasn't joking.

"Understood. We remember."

The bullies nodded immediately, not daring to oppose Su Nantian.

Su Nantian then收回 his foot, no longer pressing on Ahao.

"See, this is what it feels like when you bully others. Do you still find it amusing?"

Su Nantian continued, lecturing them.

These bullies, having witnessed Su Nantian's strength, were now furious but dared not speak out. Even if they were angry, they wouldn't dare say anything in front of Su Nantian.

They could only nod repeatedly, pretending they understood, while secretly calculating how to find someone to deal with Su Nantian after returning.

Of course, Su Nantian knew what they were thinking and didn't find it worth fearing.

"Remember, don't let me hear you harassing the villagers again; otherwise, next time I won't just tie you up but leave you here for the night."

Su Nantian paused, then continued: "You should know by now, this is a remote mountain area. At night, all kinds of beasts are around. If I tie you here, you can't fight back and will watch helplessly as beasts devour you piece by piece."

Su Nantian said this with a cold laugh, his voice lowering further, giving no chance for the bullies to breathe.

The bullies all took a sharp breath, trembling in fear at the image Su Nantian described. Their faces were pale, and no one dared to defy him.

After observing their expressions and behavior, Su Nantian nodded in satisfaction, then tossed a dagger to them.

"Here's the tool to untie you. If you can't manage it, and get eaten by beasts, that's your fate."

After saying this, Su Nantian ignored their cries and left swiftly.

In truth, Su Nantian had only intimidated them.

The ropes he tied were not tight at all; if these bullies tried, they could easily break free.

Su Nantian said this to give them a warning, making them learn their lesson and fear him so they wouldn't dare act again.

"Big brother, don't go!"

The bullies behind Su Nantian were terrified. Their imaginations were filled with images of beasts tearing their bodies apart, bloody and terrifying.

But no matter how they cried and begged behind him, Su Nantian didn't stop or return to save them.

After subduing these bullies, Su Nantian felt great joy, his steps back to the village light and quick, showing how happy he was today.

Su Nantian's mood was very good; he felt at least this time he had intimidated these bullies, making them remember not to bother the villagers of Xiaoyu again.

With this good mood, Su Nantian walked back to the village step by step.

"Uncle!"

Su Nantian had just returned when Xiaowang rushed out, hugging Su Nantian's legs.

Seeing Xiaowang, Su Nantian affectionately patted his head and peeked inside, feeling a bit strange about how quickly they had returned.

But Su Nantian suppressed his curiosity and didn't show it, instead casually asking Uncle Wang: "Uncle Wang, you returned so early today. How many fish did you catch?"

"You went to find those bullies?"

Uncle Wang didn't answer Su Nantian's question but directly asked him.

"Ah? Bullies? Uncle Wang, what are you talking about? I just went to change the medicine for Xiao Chen."

Su Nantian's heart skipped a beat. He hadn't expected Uncle Wang to be so perceptive, nor did he know how he had discovered his whereabouts. But at this moment, Su Nantian could only stick to this explanation and refused to admit it.

After all, he had truly gone to change Xiao Chen's medicine; even if Uncle Wang asked Xiao Chen directly, he wouldn't be afraid.

Uncle Wang sighed and said to Su Nantian: "You don't need to think I'm interfering with you. I truly do it for your sake and the village's. Even if you just taught them a lesson, their nature will always remain; they won't easily give up. This might bring more trouble to the village."

Uncle Wang said this and sighed again, his face showing deep worry.

He knew Su Nantian had good intentions but this would inevitably bring endless trouble. Uncle Wang also knew Su Nantian was too naive, considering too little, otherwise he wouldn't have overlooked this issue.

"You don't need to worry, Uncle Wang. As long as I'm here, every time they come, I'll drive them away. And they should have been scared by me and won't dare to come back."

Su Nantian knew he couldn't hide it from Uncle Wang anymore and so comforted him.

Su Nantian wasn't a brute; he had made certain plans before acting, and he knew he could handle these people, so he took action.

"Ah, it's no use. You're still too young."

Uncle Wang looked at Su Nantian and sighed again, still worried.

But Uncle Wang didn't continue persuading Su Nantian; instead, he lowered his head and continued organizing his fishing net without looking at Su Nantian.

Because Uncle Wang knew that arguing was useless now; Su Nantian had already done it.

Chapter 777: Spotted

"Uncle Wang?"

Su Nantian felt uneasy and opened his mouth, but hesitated before finally swallowing his words.

After a pause, Su Nantian asked Uncle Wang: "But Uncle Wang, how did you know I went to find those bullies?"

This puzzled him; he thought he hadn't left any clues, yet Uncle Wang had guessed it immediately.

Did he see him when he went out? Or did someone in the village see him and tell Uncle Wang?

But Uncle Wang had already taken Xiaowang to fish, leaving early in the morning. How could he have seen him?

Uncle Wang didn't answer immediately but first looked at Su Nantian, then pointed to his shoes and said: "It's the soil. These red earth on your shoe edges—only the small hillside has it."

At this, Uncle Wang paused and continued: "Those bullies also hang around the small hillside; there's no other place."

Uncle Wang had guessed Su Nantian went there because of this. And upon seeing his expression when he returned, Uncle Wang was even more certain.

Otherwise, this incident would have easily tricked him.

"Ah, it's the soil."

Su Nantian heard this and for once showed an embarrassed expression.

He hadn't expected to have one mistake in his meticulous plan, thinking he had covered all bases but still lost to a single oversight—or perhaps Uncle Wang was right that "the old ginger is the spiciest."

On the other hand, those bullies eventually overcame their fear and untied the ropes. Upon gaining freedom, their expressions were all furious, filled with hatred toward Su Nantian.

They didn't think they had done anything wrong but instead believed Su Nantian had provoked them, deserving death.

At this thought, they were already planning to find stronger people to deal with Su Nantian after returning.

And once they were away from danger, they seemed to have forgotten their gap with Su Nantian, attributing their loss to not being prepared and underestimating Su Nantian.

"Big Brother Hao! We can't let this stinkling boy off so easily!"

One of the bullies spoke angrily to Big Brother Hao, his face full of anger.

"Do you have to say that? I've suffered such a big loss from this stinkling boy. Can you bear it?"

Big Brother Hao glared at the man and said: "You all remember to bring your strongest fighters. That stinkling boy must be from these villages; we'll find them one by one! We definitely won't let him get away with it!"

"Big Brother Hao, you don't need to find them one by one. That stinkling boy is from Xiaoyu Village."

At this point, someone spoke up.

"How do you know?"

Others looked at him in confusion and asked.

"His clothes are made by Xiaoyu Village, I saw the fabric and knew it was definitely right!"

This person patted his chest and confidently answered, vowing not to be wrong.

"Again, Xiaoyu Village?"

Big Brother Hao spat and sneered, clearly recalling the time they had beaten up Xiao Chen.

"Hmph, this Xiaoyu Village not only produces poor vagrants but also stubborn bones."

Big Brother Hao mocked, then coldly smiled: "Let's see whose bones are harder—theirs or my steel rod!"

Having lost face and dignity to Su Nantian, even though no one else saw their embarrassment, it was the first time they had been humiliated.

They would definitely get revenge!

At this thought, the bullies all showed expressions of furious hatred. Once they found an opportunity, they would definitely teach Su Nantian a harsh lesson and take it back from him!

"Xiaoyu Village, I'll flatten you!"

Ahao clenched his fists in anger, gritting his teeth to spit out these words.

He was now angry at the entire village because of Su Nantian, determined to make all the villagers of Xiaoyu suffer for his anger.

On the other hand, Qi Yinzhen had been searching for Su Nantian for many days without any news. He was almost desperate.

"Why is there no news? Damn it! Where has Tian gone?"

Qi Yinzhen muttered angrily and worriedly. He had seen the surveillance video that day but didn't believe Su Nantian was so short-lived.

So he couldn't accept that Su Nantian had died in such a small lotus pond.

After all, Su Nantian's image was always high and mighty; every difficult mission of the Dragon Group was handled by Su Nantian alone.

All SSS-level missions could only be completed effortlessly by Su Nantian.

This powerful person, if he had died, Qi Yinzhen truly couldn't accept it.

So he secretly infiltrated the inland port to investigate Su Nantian's news and try to find any related information about Su Nantian as quickly as possible.

But he didn't find Su Nantian's news, instead discovered that the Nan Gong family had spread rumors to defame Su Nantian. Qi Yinzhen was extremely angry.

These people were truly bloodsuckers; instead of giving them benefits, they now blamed Su Nantian for every problem and pinned all the blame on him. It was truly despicable!

At this thought, Qi Yinzhen felt furious and also thought about how he had been searching for Su Nantian these days, feeling both anxious and worried. This was the perfect time to take out his anger on the Nan Gong family.

Qi Yinzhen wasn't as skilled as Su Nantian, his combat level was only slightly better than special forces. He was a technical type, so he hacked the Nan Gong family's website, making them miss the wetland bidding session.

Hmph! Want to step on Tian's position? I'll make your wishes come true!

After all, Qi Yinzhen had long been cooperating with Su Nantian and had already discovered how much the Nan Gong family valued this wetland bidding.

This time, it was his way of giving them a reward and the cost of defaming Su Nantian!

At this thought, Qi Yinzhen smiled with a cunning plan.

Others didn't know, but Qi Yinzhen was very clear: Su Nantian had killed Wu Chuan. Although it was part of their mission, it was more for the benefit of the Nan Gong family.

Those who repay kindness with betrayal should be punished!

"Good heavens! How could this happen!"

Nan Gong Yuyan was shocked upon seeing the result and immediately went to find Nan Gong Lin.

"Father! Big trouble!"

Chapter 778: Something Happened

"What's wrong? You're so flustered. Haven't I taught you to maintain the family's demeanor and not act in haste?"

Nan Gong Lin was still giving a serious lecture to Nan Gong Yuyan, teaching her to maintain the family's demeanor and not act in haste.

But before he could finish his lecture, Nan Gong Yuyan interrupted him urgently.

"Father, it's not the time to talk about this! Big trouble!"

Nan Gong Yuyan's face was anxious, her expression full of worry. She hurriedly told Nan Gong Lin about the incident and then detailed it to him.

"What! What's going on? Tell me quickly!"

Upon hearing Nan Gong Yuyan's words, Nan Gong Lin also stopped lecturing and immediately gripped the armrest, leaning forward in excitement and standing up.

"Tell me quickly!"

Nan Gong Lin urged again, wanting her to speak faster.

"Yes, Father!"

Nan Gong Yuyan nodded and then told Nan Gong Lin the details: "Father, the wetland that was to be auctioned has now been designated as a protected area and can't be developed anymore."

She had just gone out to investigate, and this was now an official document with no chance of reversal.

Nan Gong Yuyan anxiously told Nan Gong Lin, and her face showed deep worry. They hadn't expected such a twist at this crucial moment.

Designated as protected land meant there would be no development opportunities in the future. Thus, all their investments of manpower and resources were wasted instantly.

"This is how it happened? How could such a big event happen without any prior news?"

Nan Gong Lin angrily slammed the table, thinking about how this event had happened so suddenly without any warning or signs. His mood was very irritated.

Especially thinking about their losses, Nan Gong Lin's face turned dark and unappealing.

"Is it really not a mistake? This is truly unexpected!"

Nan Gong Lin furrowed his brows, his expression complex. He couldn't understand how this could be so suspicious, as if controlled by an invisible hand.

Otherwise, with their status and position, how could they have no prior signs?

The more he thought about it, the more irritated and heavy his mood became.

"Father, what should we do now?"

Nan Gong Yuyan anxiously rubbed her hands and asked Nan Gong Lin, her anxiety impossible to hide.

With so many big events happening recently, only Nan Gong Lin, the head of the family, could make decisions. Nan Gong Yuyan had no choice but to be anxious.

"Father, big trouble! Something happened!"

At this moment, the door was suddenly pushed open by someone outside.

They must have been too anxious and didn't bother to knock.

The person who rushed in from the door was Nan Gong Ping, his face full of urgency because he had run too fast and was still panting heavily.

Seeing Nan Gong Yuyan was also there, he asked: "Sister, you're here too?"

Then he turned to Nan Gong Lin and said: "Father, I heard the wetland had a problem."

After saying this, Nan Gong Ping also showed an anxious expression.

Nan Gong Lin waved his hand and sat back down, replying: "I already know."

Nan Gong Ping understood that his sister had told Nan Gong Lin first, but now wasn't the time for such matters. The key issue was how to handle this wetland, which was their focus today.

"Father, do you have any solutions?"

Nan Gong Ping anxiously asked Nan Gong Lin for an answer, his tone not very respectful due to his urgency.

Nan Gong Lin was already extremely annoyed and had a headache, so he didn't have time to answer him.

Moreover, this event was full of twists and hadn't even started yet—first Wu Chuan's incident, then this wetland being designated as protected.

Thinking about it, Nan Gong Lin sighed: "Well, it's fate."

"Give up," he sighed again and continued: "After all, we can't get it from others either. Let the previous investments and losses be as they are."

Although this was bad news, it was better than letting others take the wetland.

After all, if this wetland were developed, it would hold infinite funds. Thinking about this, Nan Gong Lin's expression slightly eased.

But Nan Gong Yuyan shook her head and interrupted Nan Gong Lin: "Father, it's not just about this matter anymore."

She said this with a serious expression: "Father, think carefully. How could this happen so suddenly? When the wetland was announced for auction, why didn't anyone act? And how could our Nan Gong family hear nothing about it?"

After saying this, she paused and continued to Nan Gong Lin: "Father, don't you think this is suspicious?"

The immediate priority was to find out the reason, not calculate their current losses.

Nan Gong Ping also nodded in agreement with Nan Gong Yuyan: "Yes, Father, I think my sister is right. This event is truly strange. How could there be no news at all?"

After all, with their background and the fact that this wetland auction wasn't a recent event but had been known for a long time, the Nan Gong family's determination to obtain this land was well-known.

If they truly wanted to change it into a protected area, how could there be no sound at all?

After thinking through these details, Nan Gong Yuyan continued: "Father, I've already sent people to investigate other families. They are now in chaos, which shows they also don't know about this news. Otherwise, their reactions wouldn't have been so intense as I saw."

This meant that the announcement was made without involving anyone in the inland port.

Why did they do this? What was the reason?

Chapter 779: A Trap Set

Why did they make this decision so suddenly?

At this thought, Nan Gong Yuyan's face became even heavier.

Nan Gong Lin had just eased his mood, but now hearing his daughter's words, he also thought it was reasonable.

"You're right. Who has such power to set us up like this?"

At this thought, Nan Gong Lin's fists clenched again, his tone revealing anger.

He paused for a moment and then ordered: "Well, Yuyan, investigate to find any clues. And you, Ping, go up and check what's going on with this matter."

This issue must be thoroughly investigated; otherwise, it would remain a thorn in the heart of the Nan Gong family.

"Yes, Father."

Nan Gong Yuyan and Nan Gong Ping answered in unison, exchanged some words of caution, then went their separate ways.

At this moment, they didn't know that their conversation had been heard clearly by someone hiding outside the window.

This person was Qi Yinzhen, Su Nantian's best partner. This was the small trick Qi Yinzhen had played, a gift he gave to the Nan Gong family.

Qi Yinzhen did this to ensure that the Nan Gong family would suffer consequences for offending and bullying Su Nantian.

"Wait, this is just the beginning. You'll know the consequences soon!"

Qi Yinzhen sneered again, thinking he had prepared many tricks against them.

As long as Su Nantian wasn't found and his safety wasn't confirmed, Qi Yinzhen wouldn't let the Nan Gong family have it easy.

If Su Nantian truly died, they would be prepared to atone for their sins against Su Nantian for a lifetime. He wouldn't let them off!

But where are you, Tian?

Qi Yinzhen felt a pang of sadness and looked up at the moon hanging in the sky.

He couldn't help but wonder if Su Nantian, if he were alive, was doing the same action.

He hoped the answer would be yes.

At this moment, the Nan Gong family didn't know they had unintentionally offended someone with such a powerful background. They also didn't know that all their efforts and strategies had ultimately been in vain, like trying to catch fish with a bamboo basket.

Meanwhile, the bullies who had previously lost to Su Nantian quickly returned to town.

They couldn't easily let go of their defeat against Su Nantian.

Now, away from Su Nantian, they had no fear or hesitation anymore.

They were now thinking about how to teach Su Nantian a lesson and regain their dignity.

"Big Brother Hao, what should we do? I can't swallow this anger; it's the first time in my life I've been humiliated!"

At this moment, one of the bullies spoke up, thinking about how they had begged for mercy before Su Nantian and felt humiliated.
