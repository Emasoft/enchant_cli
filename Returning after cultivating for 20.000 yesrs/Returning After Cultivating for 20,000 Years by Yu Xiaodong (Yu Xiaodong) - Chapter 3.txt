Actually, Su Nantian had not deceived Lin Suyun. At that moment, he had noticed Yao Lina's condition and had entered the bathroom with her to confirm it again. Before he could finish, a major misunderstanding almost occurred.

He did not want to see the two sisters quarrel because of him.

Alas, it was all because he was too outstanding.

Su Nantian rubbed his head, looking self-reproachful.

...

"Li Na, how could you keep it a secret from me? Don't worry, there's nothing wrong."

Yao Lina stared at Lin Suyun with a bewildered expression, her hands tightly gripped by Lin Suyun's.

"Just a sprain. No big deal. After Su Nantian massaged it, I feel much better."

"Don't act anymore. I know the whole story. I was mistaken about you. Get dressed and get up, then go out with me later."

"Did you know everything?"

Yao Lina was suddenly flustered, her gaze avoiding Lin Suyun's. She asked in surprise.

Did the incident just now get exposed? It shouldn't have been, since Su Nantian had cooperated perfectly. He lied so smoothly without a red face, as if it were the truth.

Maybe that kid betrayed me!

Soon after, both of them got dressed and walked out of the room.

"Hey Su Nantian, so meticulous. You even prepared breakfast!"

Yao Lina didn't hesitate and sat down to eat, occasionally glancing at Su Nantian.

"Li Na," Lin Suyun watched Yao Lina's small actions, thinking she was scolding Su Nantian. "You shouldn't blame Nantian. He told me to clear up the misunderstanding."

Upon hearing this, Yao Lina's expression immediately stiffened. She stared intently at Su Nantian as if questioning whether he had sold her out.

Seeing Yao Lina's sorrowful gaze, Su Nantian waited for a while before speaking: "I told Lin Suyun about your Uterine Cold Syndrome. It's not an incurable disease, and I can cure it."

"How did you know? I've seen many doctors. This illness has never been cured, and the symptoms are fluctuating. You haven't even seen it before. How could you know it can be cured? That's impossible!"

Yao Lina was shocked upon hearing Su Nantian say he could cure her, and she didn't believe it at all.

There was once a very renowned expert in this field who had said there was no cure for this illness, calling it a common gynecological condition. Some people had varying symptoms, and cases like hers were rare. He hadn't been able to help either.

"Of course, I saw it at a glance. There's no need for pulse diagnosis," Su Nantian said calmly.

Two thousand years of cultivation in the Immortal realm, countless near-death experiences. His medical skills had been learned under Master Cao Mu, and he had deeply mastered the true essence of his teachings. This medical skill had saved him countless times in later days.

"Great! Nantian, you must definitely help Li Na."

Lin Suyun's face lit up. From yesterday's single-handed car shaking to his superb piano skills, she had received continuous surprises. Unconsciously, she had developed absolute trust in Su Nantian.

"Of course. A friend of Suyun's is my friend. How could I not help? I'll go buy some things first to prepare."

Su Nantian smiled at Lin Suyun, a rare smile, and then got up to leave.

"Alright, he's gone. Look at her!"

Seeing Lin Suyun's infatuation with Su Nantian, she felt a pang of sorrow. Remembering the scene in the morning, her heart beat faster uncontrollably.

...

Dragon Soaring Mansion, Lakefront Villa.

Second floor.

A group of people sat in a circle. Some had their eyes closed, others seemed to have lost their souls, listening intently to the recording of Su Nantian's performance of "Xiaoxiang Shuiyun" played from the table.

After the music ended, an old man with white hair suddenly opened his eyes, a glimmer of light flashing in them.

"Brilliant piece!"

"The younger generation surpasses the older!"

"With such a person, Chinese art will never perish."

"Such exquisite skills in this generation. Rare in the world."

...

Everyone praised enthusiastically, without any hesitation.

But at that moment, an extremely discordant voice appeared.

"I think it's nothing special. It can't compare to Dong Linfeng."

The speaker was a handsome young man.

"You only listened to this recording and praised him so much. It's absurd."

"Silence, Yushu. You don't have the right to speak here. Don't be disrespectful."

Dong Tengfei saw the old man's expression turn gloomy and immediately scolded Dong Yushu.

He quickly apologized to the old man.

"Master Fang, please forgive me. I'm at fault in educating my son. He just returned from abroad and is overconfident, not knowing his limits."

The old man waved his hand. "It's no problem. It's no problem. Young people, they don't know better. Who hasn't been young?"

Don't be deceived by the old man's kind and amiable appearance. No one in the room dared to underestimate him. He was a person who could shake the earth with just a single step in the Fengcheng Art Festival.

"Where is Dong Linfeng these days?"

"Dong Linfeng hasn't returned for some years. Now how is he doing?"

"Thank you, Master Fang, for your concern. Linfeng will return next week. He's currently participating in the Vienna Music Festival abroad."

"Oh, that's good."

"When he returns, he can discuss music with Lianxing..."

Master Fang hadn't finished speaking when Lianxing interrupted.

"Teacher~ you're at it again."

"Okay, okay. Let's not talk about that anymore."

Master Fang patted Lianxing's hand affectionately.

"Lianxing, is he really only in his twenties?"

Master Fang asked softly beside her.

"Yes, teacher. I saw him with my own eyes. I thought he was a flirtatious man at first, but it turned out he's an expert in piano and also has a good appearance..."

Lianxing kept talking, her smile becoming even more radiant.

Master Fang saw this and his eyes were full of affection. His heart was already delighted. It was rare for his little disciple to be impressed by someone. He had introduced several people before, but none of them were accepted. It had made him so worried that he lost a lot of hair.

No wonder she was unhappy earlier.

"Lianxing, since you said so much about him, why don't we call him out to assess him?"

"Yes, Lianxing. With such talent, everyone wants to meet him in person. Don't hesitate anymore."

One person saw Lianxing was hesitant and urged her.

"Ah, no. I don't have his contact information."

Lianxing looked embarrassed and troubled, her cheeks turning red.

"Ha ha, no problem. There's plenty of time. No rush."

"Teacher~"

Lianxing scolded with a pout and didn't explain further. She knew the teacher had misunderstood, and explaining would only make it worse.

Master Fang saw Lianxing's red face and didn't say more. He changed the subject, saying, "Today is a rare happy occasion. How about we have a small gathering here?"

"Good, that's great."

...

Chapter 10: Kidnapping

At this moment, Su Nantian was walking to the pharmacy. He hadn't paid much attention when he left and had asked for directions before finally finding it.

As soon as he entered the pharmacy, he heard a familiar melody. It was indeed the "Xiaoxiang Shuiyun" he had played yesterday, but he didn't pay much attention. He hadn't expected to hear this song in a pharmacy.

"Welcome, sir. What do you need?"

A clear and pleasant voice came from the front desk. He turned around and saw a girl with an elegant appearance, her figure tall and well-proportioned. She wore a white uniform, and her shapely legs were wrapped in flesh-colored stockings.

"One box of acupuncture needles."

Su Nantian spoke, but the girl didn't move. She stared at him intently with her red lips slightly open as if she had discovered something new.

"You... you are..."

Su Nantian quickly made a silence gesture. Although he didn't mind being stared at with intense eyes, he didn't want to cause a commotion.

The female employee immediately understood his meaning and hurriedly fetched two boxes of acupuncture needles for him.

Su Nantian reached into his pocket, and his heart skipped a beat. He had forgotten to bring money!

He only brought some change in the morning, and he spent it all on breakfast. He hadn't taken his phone or wallet when he went for a run in the morning.

He looked embarrassed and smiled awkwardly.

Seeing Su Nantian's hand rummaging in his pocket without taking anything out, the female employee immediately understood and gave him a look that said "I get it."

"It's okay. Just let me do a small favor for you?"

The female employee smiled mischievously.

"What?"

"Let's take a photo together."

Su Nantian was stunned. He hadn't expected this request. Seeing the girl's eager eyes, he finally couldn't bring himself to refuse her.

Click!

Under the beauty camera and carefully calculated angles, the female employee was very satisfied with the result. Even the small pimple that had appeared in the morning was gone. The two of them looked like a couple in love.

Su Nantian didn't care about this, but he was very annoyed. When had a Celestial Lord ever been unable to pay such a small amount and had to sell his body for payment?

He didn't know that after leaving the pharmacy, the female employee immediately posted the photo online.

"Who is this man? He seems familiar."

"Could it be the performer of 'Xiaoxiang Shuiyun'?"

"I listened to this piece and had never slept so soundly."

"You don't know, it's already on the front page. The piece played by this worldly prince has a calming effect, especially the clear version."

"The girl isn't me. Not me. Ahhh."

"God has a girlfriend!"

...

Su Nantian didn't know that one photo of his had caused such a stir.

Even more astonishing than the popularity of his song.

【Suspected God's Girlfriend Appears】

【Worldly Prince Visits His Girlfriend】

Various clickbait headlines flew everywhere.

...

While walking on the street, Su Nantian was unaware of it and didn't care about these small matters.

But at this moment, the several hangers-on following him were very unpleasant. He turned around and spoke calmly to them, "Do you also want to take a photo with me?"

"Yes, this is the person Wang Ge was looking for."

A thin-faced man pointed at Su Nantian to a bald-headed big man.

"This kid, pale and delicate. He's even more handsome than in the photo. The boss overestimated him. I can kill him with one hand."

After saying this, he waved his hand and three big men rushed forward.

"Go away," Su Nantian spoke calmly, releasing endless killing intent.

The three men felt the overwhelming pressure and stopped in their tracks, a sense of retreat forming in their hearts.

"Useless. Even a kid without hair could scare you. Get up," the bald-headed man shouted.

The three men heard the bald-headed man's scolding. If they retreated now, they would be beaten to death.

"Kill!"

The three men steeled their courage and shouted in unison. Their voices hadn't finished when Su Nantian was already at their front, and he kicked them.

They flew out like trash and collided with a garbage can.

"Useless, always useless." The bald-headed man spat out some saliva and took out a iron rod from behind.

He swung it at Su Nantian's head.

Whooosh!

The fierce rod was accompanied by a gust of wind, and the bald-headed man's arm veins bulged. His face showed a victorious expression as if he had seen Su Nantian's head bleeding.

Then he saw an unbelievable scene, and his smile immediately froze.

Su Nantian extended one hand to easily catch the approaching iron rod and pulled it aside. He kicked the big man, who was then stepped on by Su Nantian.

"Ah!"

A sharp scream came from the big man's bloodied mouth. Several teeth夹着 blood fell to the ground.

Su Nantian was truly angry. The dignity of a Celestial Lord could not be challenged by such insignificant creatures.

In the Immortal Realm, even hearing his Celestial Lord's name would make people kneel and worship. No one dared to defy the dignity of a Celestial Lord.

In the Immortal Realm, it was so. After rebirth, it would be the same.

Crack!

The bald-headed man's thigh had already broken, but no blood flowed out.

He didn't want to get his own blood on him, so he controlled the power, but the bones inside were already shattered.

The thin-faced man had already lost his legs and was sitting on the ground, pale and lifeless.

"Big brother, mercy! It's all Wang Ge who made me do this. It's all Wang Ge. Wang Ge said you chased after the woman he liked, and yesterday also ruined his plans, so... so we came to capture you."

The thin-faced man looked at Su Nantian approaching and stammered.

Su Nantian didn't know that yesterday Wu Yuanying had come to him again, and she was deeply regretful. So he directly refused Wang Cheng's hotel meeting invitation. He had planned to actively pursue her, thinking that if Su Nantian liked her, he would take the initiative.

At this moment, the thin-faced man's phone rang.

"Ring ring ring, ring ring ring."

After thinking for a while, the thin-faced man didn't have the courage to answer.

"Answer it!"

Su Nantian coldly spoke, without any emotion.

It was even a video call.

The thin-faced man trembled and clicked to answer it.

"Where is he? I knew it. A bunch of useless people. Tell him, his woman is in my hands. If he doesn't come, wait for the corpse," laughed.

The phone was a man with a scar on his face.

"Knife Brother, he's right here."

After saying this, the thin-faced man turned the phone toward Su Nantian.

In the video, a woman was tied to a chair, and the scarred man's hands were freely roaming over her body.

"Take your dirty hands off. If even one hair is missing, I'll kill you."

Seeing the woman inside, Su Nantian's eyes narrowed and his expression became even more gloomy. It was her, the female employee from the pharmacy.

Threatening him? For how many years had someone dared to threaten him.

Good, he waved his hand and the thin-faced man's phone turned into ashes.

"Lead the way!"

Su Nantian coldly spoke, his expression even more gloomy. Those who knew him would know that the Celestial Lord was angry.

Chapter 11: Intense Exercise

Half an hour later, the old car factory.

Su Nantian surveyed the area. It was indeed a good place for killing and burying bones, erasing evidence.

He had planned it this way. A strange smile curled on his lips.

"Quick, the boss is waiting!"

When they arrived at this place, the thin-faced man immediately changed his expression.

The thin-faced man impatiently urged him. He was very confident in the boss, looking at Su Nantian's cold gaze without fear. There was no longer the timid look he had before.

"You'd better pray your head is still on your neck."

A creature no more than an ant dared to challenge him. How often had that happened!

Soon they entered the abandoned car yard, which was empty and silent.

A sharp whistle came from the thin-faced man's mouth. Seven well-built men in black clothes appeared out of nowhere and quickly surrounded Su Nantian.

Su Nantian's eyes flashed with light. There was also one person on the second floor, who should be their leader.

" I've come. You still hide your heads and tails. What are you?"

Clap clap clap!

The loud slaps echoed around.

"Indeed, he has some skills. Unfortunately, today you will die and never see your little girlfriend again. Ha ha, by the way, that girl's figure is quite attractive. I promise to make her feel ecstatic."

A tall man with a scar on his face jumped down from the second floor, making the earth tremble.

"Knife Brother, your strategy was brilliant. You directly kidnapped his girlfriend. After the boss had fun, let the men have a taste too."

The thin-faced man flattered Knife Brother constantly.

"That's definitely true. If it weren't for me seeing this kid and the girl's photo online, you wouldn't have brought him here."

The scarred man seemed to enjoy the thin-faced man's flattery.

"That's right, that's right. It's all because of Knife Brother's wisdom."

The thin-faced man continued to flatter.

The scarred man looked at Su Nantian and snapped his fingers.

The seven black-cloaked men immediately rushed forward, waving their weapons and charging recklessly.

Su Nantian kicked each of the seven men in different directions, sending them flying backward.

The thin-faced man watched this and kept rubbing his eyes, thinking he had seen it wrong. These seven were the most powerful subordinates of Knife Brother. It was only because Wang Ge had paid a heavy price that Knife Brother didn't want to send them out.

"Knife Brother..."

The thin-faced man tugged at Knife Brother's sleeve, but was immediately kicked away by Knife Brother.

"Useless!"

After saying this, he took out a gun from behind.

Click click!

Two bullets hit Su Nantian's body, but they bounced elsewhere.

The scarred man was shocked and couldn't believe his eyes. He fired several more shots, all of which were the same.

At this moment, Su Nantian had already reached Knife Brother's front and kicked him. The knife brother fell to the ground immediately.

"Where is she?"

Su Nantian stepped on Knife Brother's thigh, which cracked with a sound.

At this moment, the knife brother was in so much pain he couldn't speak. His trembling fingers pointed upward.

Su Nantian let out a cold snort and grabbed Knife Brother and the thin-faced man with both hands. He jumped up to the second floor.

The female employee was tied to a chair, her face flushed and dazed. Her long legs were stretched straight.

It seemed he had come just in time, otherwise something would have happened.

"What did you give her?"

Seeing something was wrong, he stepped on Knife Brother's other leg.

"Ah!"

A sharp scream came out of the knife brother, making the thin-faced man's skin crawl and his hair stand on end.

"Love-Inducing Powder."

The knife brother managed to say those three words with all his strength.

"Scoundrel!"

Su Nantian looked at the remaining Love-Inducing Powder on the table and smiled coldly.

He grabbed the thin-faced man and forced his face onto the table.

"Clean it up, or else..."

Hehehe.

"You like to flatter so much. I'll let you flatter as much as you want."

The voice that came from Su Nantian made the thin-faced man's ears feel terrifying.

Soon, the thin-faced man finished cleaning. Su Nantian threw him onto the lifeless Knife Brother. The thin-faced man, already suffering from fire and burning, couldn't withstand it anymore.

Cries of pain kept coming out. Two bodies collided continuously.

Clap clap clap, clap clap clap.

The sound of lustful music never ceased.

Su Nantian waved his hand, and a thread of spiritual purple flame flew onto the two bodies. In an instant, they turned to ashes.

When Su Nantian untied the female employee from the chair, she suddenly wrapped her arms around his neck and stretched her long legs around his waist. It was impossible to resist.

Su Nantian's two thousand years of cultivation experience had seen everything. How could such beauty move his heart?

To prevent the female employee from falling, he placed his hands on her hips. This was no small matter; two thousand years without a woman, this body had long been desperate.

Although his heart was firm, his second brother had already risen.

He cursed inwardly.

Quickly, he carried the female employee and ran to the nearest small hotel.

After a fierce exercise, he was drenched in sweat. Finally, he laid the female employee on the bed.

Actually, Su Nantian could have carried ten people without sweating. But he couldn't resist a beautiful woman panting, making his inner heat rise and nowhere to release it.

He unfastened the female employee's top, revealing two white peaks towering high. The valley between them was deep and unfathomable.

Su Nantian took a deep breath and quickly took out the acupuncture needles, making three precise and steady punctures.

One of them fell into the valley and was nowhere to be found.

Su Nantian inwardly thought she was a demon.

After finishing the acupuncture, he quickly rushed to the bathroom and took a cold shower.

Finally resolved!

Su Nantian came out of the bathroom. A thread of spiritual purple flame emerged, and his clothes emitted wisps of white steam. Soon it was dry.

Looking at the beauty on the bed, he thought again and decided to take the initiative. If she came back, it would be unclear.

"Hey, young man, you're pretty fast," the hotel receptionist said with a squinted eye and took out a blue pill. "Try this."

Su Nantian's face turned black. He turned around and left without looking back.

...

Area A, Room 105 Villa

"Why did he take so long and didn't bring his phone?" Lin Suyun was lying on the sofa, scrolling through her phone and complaining.

"It's only been a short time. You're already missing your little man? And you said you weren't sneaking around to find another man."

Yao Lina teased, but she was also very anxious.

After so many years, she had finally waited for this moment. No matter if it was really cured or not, she was willing to try.

"Oh, Su Nantian's piece at Huiyun Residence is now popular. Online it says it has a calming effect and cured years of insomnia."

Lin Suyun saw this message and immediately sat up from the bed.

If it really had that effect, she must have him record a clear version for her mother to cure her long-term insomnia.

Continuing to scroll, she suddenly stopped and stood up.

Chapter 12: A Little Lower, Then a Little Lower

"Li Na, who is this woman?"

The two of them leaned in and looked closely at every inch of her skin.

"I don't know this woman, but isn't the man Su Nantian?"

"Yes. Maybe he's seeing his little girlfriend behind my back."

Lin Suyun said it and her face turned red immediately.

"Ah, you're already jealous. When did Su Nantian become your little girlfriend?"

...

Click!

The door opened, and before Su Nantian even stepped in, he felt two "killings." He stopped his steps and immediately guessed what it was. His head ached.

"I know what you want to say. Please let me explain..."

In an instant, Su Nantian took a step forward and spoke before the two women could speak. But he hadn't finished speaking when he was met with two cushions.

Women's hearts were truly hard to predict.

The two women didn't speak, but stared at Su Nantian with anger.

"I just went to the pharmacy to buy something to help Li Na. When I tried to pay, I realized I had forgotten my money. Then..."

"Then you sold yourself and became her boyfriend?"

Su Nantian hadn't finished speaking when Lin Suyun interrupted him.

Seeing Lin Suyun's face, which was both angry and anxious, with her lips pouted, it was very cute.

A thought he didn't believe himself surfaced: maybe this girl was jealous.

Su Nantian smiled slightly, but his head ached again.

"How could that be? There are two beauties waiting for me at home. I miss them so much, it's like three years without seeing them. That's why I had to agree to the photo."

"Really?"

The two women asked in unison.

After watching Su Nantian's calm and unshaken expression, after a long while, Lin Suyun finally said, "Well, I'll believe you this time. Hurry up and treat Li Na."

The three of them entered the room. Su Nantian looked left and right, unsure how to start speaking when Lin Suyun seemed to sense something and said, "What? Can't I look? Do you think I'm going to take advantage of Li Na when I'm not here?"

Lin Suyun wore a triumphant expression, as if she had known his secret thoughts all along.

"Okay then."

Su Nantian reluctantly agreed.

He swore he had no intention of taking advantage of Yao Lina at all.

"The acupuncture points are around the navel."

Yao Lina lifted her top, revealing her slender waist.

"Lower a little more. Lower again."

Su Nantian frowned slightly, as the area to be needled had not yet been exposed.

Almost when the black lace was about to appear,

"Stop. This position is enough."

Su Nantian didn't dare to continue.

Yao Lina, lying on the bed, was already flushed with redness.

Lin Suyun secretly felt sorrowful. If I weren't here, would he have done more?

"This one needs a little more."

Su Nantian made another request, without feeling it was excessive at all.

"Higher a little more. Higher again."

Until the black lace was barely visible, Su Nantian called for a stop.

After careful consideration, he spoke again: "You should take off your top as well."

Yao Lina's face turned even redder.

Must it be like this?

It was the first time she had taken off her top in front of a man. If it were Su Nantian, she wasn't entirely against it.

But the problem was that Lin Suyun was standing there.

Seeing Yao Lina's gaze, Su Nantian immediately realized something?

"It's just that the upper and lower parts need to be connected, forming a cycle. So the upper part also needs acupuncture."

Lin Suyun's heart was already unsettled. She hadn't expected him to be such a lecherous person.

It would be best if he could cure Li Na's illness. Otherwise, she'd see.

Lin Suyun coughed twice and couldn't bear it anymore. She glared at Su Nantian angrily.

"I suddenly remembered I have something to do. I'll go take care of it."

She said and left without looking back.

Su Nantian awkwardly rubbed his nose.

As Yao Lina took off her top, two bountiful fruits seemed to break free from their constraints and trembled as if they were about to jump out.

Su Nantian's blood rushed up immediately, and he quickly suppressed his mind.

He took out the acupuncture needles. He inserted several into her lower abdomen.

Holding the needle handle, he applied spiritual purple flame to his hand and slowly permeated the heat through the acupuncture needles into her skin.

He疏通 blocked meridians. Soon, sweat beads formed on Su Nantian's forehead.

The cultivation level of just one layer was indeed challenging.

After a long time, he finally unblocked the abdominal meridians.

Next was the upper part.

Looking at the magnificent scene before him, his mind remained calm.

He repeated the process and quickly inserted the needles.

Unfortunately, due to its magnificence, his hands inevitably touched it. Su Nantian didn't feel anything about it.

But Yao Lina felt otherwise.

This place had never been touched by any man before.

Her skin immediately tensed, and a flush appeared.

The heat slowly penetrated into her skin. Yao Lina took a deep breath, feeling comfortable.

This sound was not loud but seemed very awkward in the silent room.

After a long time, Su Nantian slowly withdrew the needles.

It seemed his strength was still too weak. He needed to strengthen quickly.

"Yao Lina, due to some other reasons, I need to treat you again after a while for it to be fully cured. But after this treatment, your symptoms will improve significantly."

"Ah, I need to come again?"

"Yes."

Although it sounded intentional, Yao Lina felt a strange excitement.

As she opened the door, Lin Suyun was standing at the entrance.

"Your phone."

She said and left without looking back.

Su Nantian was bewildered. What had he done wrong?

"Who is this?"

"Susie, I am Zhang Fudai of the Fengcheng TV Station. We have a talk show and a famous classical music artist wants to meet you. I want to invite you to attend, hoping you can give me the favor of coming."

Zhang Chusheng had already tried to lower his posture as much as possible, using a begging tone.

He had called once before and was directly refused. His tone was so霸道.

Going to beg him, going to beg a small internet celebrity. Why?

Zhang Chusheng almost wanted to throw the phone away. But who could have imagined that shortly after, he received a call from the station director.

The station director said another talk show's famous classical music artist wanted to meet this young man.

After hanging up, he almost fainted. He had sworn not to go beg before, but now it was already done without leaving the office.

Zhang Chusheng sat on the chair and struggled for a long time. He drank several cups of coffee before finally making up his mind and called again.

But the other party let him wait. How could that be?

When had he ever been treated like this by someone of lower status? It was completely ignoring him.

Chapter 13: Still Refused

Just as he was about to hang up, a voice came through.

"I'm busy. I don't have time."

Su Nantian's cold voice reached the other end, and Zhang Chusheng almost wanted to curse. He thought of the station director but held back.

The position of the station director was something he had coveted for a long time. If this matter failed, not only would the station director position be lost but even his current deputy position might not be safe.

"Sir, please set a price. How much would you come for just a formality?"

Zhang Chusheng thought this was his lowest posture, but it was far from enough for Su Nantian. How could a Celestial Lord be commanded by an ant?

"Go away. If you want me to attend, come and beg me."

"Beep beep beep..."

Zhang Chusheng was almost angry. Why did he have such a big attitude? His own attitude wasn't that big. Even top stars didn't dare to talk like this to him. Who was he?

Gurgle, gurgle.

After cursing, his mouth was dry and thirsty. He drank a lot of water.

Looking at the empty cup, he shouted: "Water, secretary."

...

After hanging up, Su Nantian was very annoyed. Now did any little dog dare to jump in front of him?

"What's wrong?" Lin Suyun asked, seeing Su Nantian was very angry.

"A TV station's deputy director wanted me to appear on a show. I refused it. He called again, and I also refused."

"Ha! Your will is really firm. He's a complete wolf."

Lin Suyun laughed lightly.

"I didn't even meet him, but I knew he wasn't a good person."

"You're just bragging. Seriously, you've changed so much compared to when you were in high school."

Lin Suyun looked at him with curiosity.

"People do grow. After experiencing some things, naturally they change. No matter how much you change, I'm still the Su Nantian you knew."

Lin Suyun stared at Su Nantian, lost in thought.

"Suyun, wow, you really found a treasure. He can definitely cure my illness," Yao Lina said excitedly after she felt better, grabbing Lin Suyun's arm.

"Don't talk nonsense. He was my classmate. How could he be found?"

Lin Suyun scolded.

"Classmate, it must be an unusual classmate. I didn't say that wrong, did I?"

Yao Lina looked between the two.

"By the way, there's a high school class reunion tomorrow. Let's go attend it."

Lin Suyun seemed to remember something and changed the subject.

"Good, I also have some friends who haven't seen for a long time. I wonder how they're doing."

Su Nantian had already forgotten the faces of those classmates, after all, two thousand years was a long time.

"I won't go with you. I also have a gathering tomorrow," Yao Lina said, her eyes losing much of their light. This good opportunity was taken by Suyun.

"Why are you joining us?"

"Also, I'll go with Suyun then," he said without waiting for Suyun's response and hurriedly left.

"Did you really cure her hidden illness?" Lin Suyun knew that this disease was a world problem. It couldn't be cured even abroad. When she heard Su Nantian had cured it, she was shocked.

"Of course. What's the big deal? It's a small matter."

It was just a congenital deficiency in body structure. In the Immortal Realm, what illness hadn't they seen? None could compare to this disease.

Su Nantian didn't feel it was anything, but for Lin Suyun it was different.

"Then can you cure paralysis?"

Lin Suyun's eyes shone with hope, looking at Su Nantian.

"It's not a big problem."
