Xu Xiangning recalled the images she had seen in the surveillance footage, and Su Nantian's extraordinary abilities made her shudder involuntarily.
"He truly is not an ordinary person, Awen!"
Xu Xiangning, fearing that Xu Wen might not believe her, emphasized her words again: "Otherwise, come and see for yourself."
After saying this, Xu Xiangning immediately beckoned Xu Wen to join her in examining the surveillance footage.
These power users had surpassed human capabilities, and it was only through Grandmother Xu's extensive connections and resources that they had been hired.
Originally, they had hoped these individuals would protect the Xu family, but when danger arrived, they were too preoccupied with their own survival to be of any use!
The thought alone filled Xu Xiangning with fury, feeling they had been deceived by these power users.
Xu Wen had initially doubted Xu Xiangning's words, suspecting she might be exaggerating out of fear.
But after viewing the surveillance footage, Xu Wen fell silent, realizing Xu Xiangning had not exaggerated at all. Her account was perfectly accurate.
Because Su Nantian's abilities were truly terrifying.
"这个人……"
Xu Wen slowly opened his mouth to speak, but hesitated, unable to find the right words. His expression was complex and troubled.
He seemed at a loss, unsure of how to proceed.
"Regardless of how powerful he is, the hatred for killing my mother is insurmountable. He also killed my older brother and third brother; I could never forgive him!"
Xu Wen clenched his fists. "Sister, I'll first send you away. If this man knows there are still Xu family members alive, he will surely return."
At that moment, Xu Wen was considering future actions—but this time, he had mistakenly accused Su Nantian.
Su Nantian had come to the Xu family seeking retribution not out of malice, but with a principle of "let them who offend me suffer the same."
Now that he had dealt with the Xu family, Su Nantian would not look back. Especially now, his top priority was protecting Xiao Wang's safety and identity—therefore, he would not seek out the Xu family.
"Good."
Xu Xiangning nodded without hesitation, having no intention of facing death with her family.
She dared not involve herself in this matter anymore, regardless of whether Su Nantian had truly killed her family.
Xu Wen was surprised by how readily Xu Xiangning agreed, expecting at least a token resistance. Yet she had accepted immediately.
Xu Wen furrowed his brow, discontentedly eyeing Xu Xiangning.
This sister of his truly did not disappoint—her actions were selfish and devoid of any family spirit.
Xu Wen's gaze was too obvious, making Xu Xiangning blush awkwardly.
"I..."
Xu Xiangning instinctively spoke, attempting to explain and ease her awkwardness.
But Xu Wen raised a hand to stop her: "Enough, sister. You need not explain. Let us save one person at a time. I will arrange for your departure shortly."
When people are desperate or afraid, their reactions stem from instinct—truthful thoughts.
Thus, when Xu Wen heard her answer, he had already decided there was no need for further explanation.
Though Xu Xiangning still felt awkward, she realized that such feelings or face issues were trivial compared to life itself.
"Then Awen, I'll trust your arrangements. We are family after all; don't say one thing and do another, leaving me behind!"
After thinking it through, Xu Xiangning accepted Xu Wen's plan without hesitation.
People see the world as they are. Since Xu Xiangning was selfish, she assumed Xu Wen and herself were equally despicable.
Thus, she repeatedly warned Xu Wen, fearing he would abandon her.
"Trust me, sister. I'll send you away as soon as arrangements are made."
Xu Wen, knowing Xu Xiangning's character, did not become angry at her suspicion but made a promise.
"Still, for now, be quiet and don't cause any commotion. Don’t add to my troubles."
Xu Wen added another warning, as he needed to focus on revenge. Other matters would have to wait.
He was also concerned Xu Xiangning might interfere at this time.
"Awen, rest assured I'll be well-behaved."
After hearing Xu Wen's assurance and promise, Xu Xiangning sighed in relief. Even without his reminder, she would stay quiet and avoid going out.
After responding to Xu Wen, she immediately returned to her room without staying to discuss how to deal with Su Nantian.
Xu Wen did not keep her, for in his eyes, Xu Xiangning's silence was a blessing. He could not expect her to help.
Thus, he let her go.
Yet Xu Wen still had questions: why had Su Nantian suddenly come to the Xu family?
Had he learned of their connection with Wu Chuan?
Or had Su Nantian targeted the Xu family's status, wanting to claim it for himself?
But why had he killed them and done nothing else?
Xu Wen had originally thought the Xu family's status in Enshi was extraordinary, and Su Nantian would surely have other plans after eliminating them. Yet he had done nothing.
After dealing with them, Su Nantian simply left without further action.
This puzzled Xu Wen even more.
To confront an enemy, one must find their weakness and strike accordingly. But Su Nantian had killed them and left without any further moves, showing no intent to take over the Xu family.
This made Xu Wen unsure of Su Nantian's intentions.
What was his hidden purpose?
Xu Wen's mind was troubled, endlessly pondering this question.
His immediate priority was to locate Su Nantian. Without knowing his whereabouts, there would be no chance of revenge.
"Come."
Xu Wen called for the old housekeeper.
Now that Grandmother Xu, Xu Hai, and Xu Tian were dead, the Xu family belonged to Xu Wen. He was now the head of the household.
The old housekeeper and servants understood this shift, treating Xu Wen with utmost respect. Upon hearing his voice, they quickly entered the room, carefully observing him.
"Master, what are your orders?"
The old housekeeper respectfully asked, automatically changing his title.
"Master?"
Xu Wen was taken aback. These people had previously called him "Second Master," but now the title change made his expression shift.
"Now the Xu family is undeniably your domain, Second Master. Therefore, you are our master now. Only a master can lead us to greater heights."
The old housekeeper was skilled at flattery, understanding Xu Wen's reaction to the title change. He immediately called out again with great enthusiasm.
His respect was evident, and his admiration for Xu Wen was clear.
Xu Wen was again taken aback, but his expression softened.
Clearly, he enjoyed being called this way.
"Order everyone to stop their tasks and search for Su Nantian's location. Once confirmed, report immediately. I will personally teach him a lesson."
Xu Wen admired himself for a moment before quickly regaining his composure and issuing the order to the old housekeeper.
He would settle accounts with Su Nantian thoroughly and would not let him off lightly.
Upon hearing Xu Wen's plan to find Su Nantian, the old housekeeper was startled and widened his eyes. He immediately looked up at Xu Wen in shock.
"Master..."
The old housekeeper hesitated, as if about to speak but stopped himself.
But before he could finish, Xu Wen interrupted him with disapproval.
"What? Do you have an issue?"
Xu Wen noticed the old housekeeper's strange expression and frowned, asking discontentedly.
The old housekeeper realized Xu Wen had made up his mind and dared not voice any opposition, so he quickly shook his head. "Master is overthinking. I dare not oppose. I will immediately issue the order for them to search for this Su Nantian."

Chapter 920: Divergent Motives
He had stayed at the Xu family that day, having witnessed Su Nantian's swift actions and his extraordinary abilities.
Thus, when he heard Xu Wen still intended to oppose Su Nantian, the old housekeeper felt deep concern and unease. He feared Xu Wen might suffer at Su Nantian's hands.
But Xu Wen's expression and tone left no room for argument. If he had spoken his mind, the old housekeeper knew the first to suffer would not be Su Nantian but himself.
After thinking this through, the old housekeeper changed his mind immediately and withdrew his thoughts.
Xu Wen knew the old housekeeper had attempted to speak but, seeing him now wisely remain silent and avoid saying what he disliked, let it go without further argument.
He waved his hand, signaling the old housekeeper to leave.
"Go. Remember, have them move quickly and find this man as soon as possible!"
Xu Wen added another order, his gaze turning sharp. Once he found Su Nantian, he would definitely avenge his family.
No matter how outstanding and powerful Su Nantian was, he would kill him.
Su Nantian at that moment had no idea he had become a target of the Xu family. If he did, he would surely laugh.
These people had no idea where they got their audacity to act so hypocritically.
They had come to kill him under the guise of righteousness, but when he returned with the same method, they were quick to protest.
They even wanted to confront him again. Yet even if they found him, Su Nantian would not fear them at all.
Su Nantian had already decided his priority was to protect Xiao Wang and ensure his safety at all costs. He would not let him face danger again.
As for anyone threatening Xiao Wang's safety, Su Nantian would not let them live.
Everyone had their own motives and hatreds, never idle.
All were searching for Su Nantian to confront him. Besides that, others also sought his well-being.
For instance, Qi Yinzhen, who had been desperately searching for Su Nantian.
Since the last time he discovered Su Nantian was likely still alive and saw his movements, Qi Yinzhen had been extremely excited.
He also felt he must find Su Nantian quickly and bring him back to headquarters.
The headquarters knew the immense value in Su Nantian's body, so they were eager to send people to find him.
The search was proceeding with great intensity, but the protagonist at that time was unaware of this news. He also did not know that besides his lost memories, many other things had been forgotten.
Even if they found Su Nantian, he would only tell them he must first resolve Xiao Wang's matters before leaving.
He would stay with Xiao Wang until he could support himself or make his own decisions, then respect Xiao Wang's choice.
This night was destined to be sleepless for everyone. No one could rest peacefully, all caught in insomnia due to their thoughts and uncertainties about the future.
"Big Brother!"
The next morning, Xiao Chen and others immediately came to Su Nantian.
Seeing Su Nantian, they finally relaxed, as if a heavy stone had been lifted from their hearts.
They hadn't slept well the entire night and kept thinking about the terrifying events that had occurred before their eyes. The thought of villagers being killed made it impossible for them to accept the reality.
More importantly, they feared that upon waking up, Su Nantian would be gone.
Now they regarded Su Nantian as their reliance and spiritual pillar. If he truly disappeared, it would be a heavy blow.
The worst part was they couldn't imagine life without Su Nantian.
Thus, they hadn’t slept well and arrived at Su Nantian’s side immediately upon dawn to confirm he was still there.
"What's wrong? Is there something?"
Su Nantian heard the commotion and came out. Seeing Xiao Chen's excitement, he thought something major had happened.
But upon seeing their faces without fear, he set aside his thoughts.
Xiao Wang was still asleep, so Su Nantian had time to come out and see them.
"Nothing. We thought Big Brother was gone."
Xiao Chen swallowed his saliva upon seeing Su Nantian, not hiding his thoughts but directly telling him. Then he gave a sheepish smile.
Su Nantian, upon hearing this, was amused: "How? Did you think I would leave you behind?"
He didn't know why Xiao Chen had thought this way or why they were so worried.
"You can stay with me if you need to, but I have too many secrets and don't know what dangers lie ahead. I don’t want to drag you into this."
Su Nantian now opened up to them, telling his true feelings.
He felt if he said nothing, they might be suspicious and speculate endlessly. It was better to tell them directly so they could prepare mentally instead of constantly worrying.
These were truly Su Nantian's thoughts.
He still didn't know his identity or what secrets he carried. If they insisted on following him, they might indeed face danger.
Thus, Su Nantian wanted to lay it all out so they could decide for themselves.
"Big Brother, now that the villagers of Xiaoyu have died, what else can we follow but you? Unless Big Brother wants to abandon us, we won't leave."

Chapter 921: Next Steps
"Big Brother! We are all willing to follow you! No matter what!"
Xiao Chen immediately expressed his thoughts, truly heartfelt.
He had thought about Su Nantian all day yesterday and wondered what their lives would be like without him.
Thus, he could not leave.
Chen Xiaoling followed her brother everywhere; wherever he went, she did too. Moreover, Chen Xiaoling felt it was better to be with Su Nantian.
As for the other young man, Ayu, he had no relatives in Xiaoyu village. He was raised by his grandparents, who passed away two years ago. Since then, he had lived with the villagers.
Now that all the villagers were dead, he naturally followed Su Nantian.
Thus, he immediately agreed with Xiao Chen: "Yes, Big Brother, we all follow you. Unless you want to drive us away, we won't leave."
"Alright, don’t be so anxious. I said this to let you know the dangers of following me, not to drive you away."
Su Nantian saw their tension and comforted them. He had no other intention but to let them think carefully.
"Big Brother, what's your plan next? Will we stay in Xiaoyu village?"
Upon hearing Su Nantian's words, and seeing his serious expression, they knew he was not joking. They all sighed in relief.
But upon thinking of the possibility of those people returning, they felt uneasy again.
"Of course, you asked me this yesterday."
Su Nantian nodded in response, confirming for Xiao Chen and others.
"They killed Uncle Wang and other villagers of Xiaoyu. I will not let them off."
Su Nantian's intention was to avenge the villagers of Xiaoyu. The second matter was to uncover Xiao Wang's identity.
This was a promise he had made to Uncle Wang, and Su Nantian would never forget it.
Upon hearing this, Xiao Chen and others nodded in agreement: "Yes, Big Brother, we must avenge the villagers of Xiaoyu."
They had lived together for so long and felt deep bonds. None had expected their peaceful life would be destroyed one day.
Now that the villagers of Xiaoyu were dead, leaving only them, they could not ignore this. If those people dared to return, they would fight back with all their might and seek revenge!
"Big Brother, teach us a few moves."
At this point, Xiao Chen immediately looked at Su Nantian: "We are helpless and lack the ability to resist. If those people come, we will only be a burden and unable to help you."
After saying this, he continued: "Big Brother, teach us a few moves so we can protect ourselves."
Xiao Chen thought of this and immediately proposed his suggestion to Su Nantian.
Chen Xiaoling and AYu also nodded in agreement, believing Xiao Chen's words were reasonable. They did not expect to be as powerful as Su Nantian, but they wanted to avoid being constantly protected by him.
They also wished to contribute to avenging the villagers of Xiaoyu and personally seek revenge.
Su Nantian furrowed his brow, initially unwilling for them to involve themselves in such dangers. In Su Nantian's plan, since they would not leave, he would protect them.
Moreover, Su Nantian had always believed that as long as they were under his protection and not troubled by others, it would be enough.
But upon hearing Xiao Chen's words, Su Nantian immediately reconsidered. He felt Xiao Chen’s words were indeed reasonable.
Teaching them was better than merely protecting them; they wanted self-reliance and to be able to support themselves.
After thinking it through, Su Nantian nodded: "Alright, I'll teach you."
It was just a few moves to help them defend themselves and avoid being taken advantage of.
"But my memories are incomplete, I don't know how I obtained these abilities or a systematic method. I can only teach you based on my impressions. Will that bother you?"
Su Nantian thought about this and began to consider what methods to teach them.
Xiao Chen and others only wanted to become stronger, not to be a burden on Su Nantian. Whatever he taught them, they would accept without objection.
"Will you learn too?"
Su Nantian saw them all nod and thus set aside his thoughts, deciding to teach them.
But at this moment, Su Nantian turned to look at Chen Xiaoling and asked with a raised eyebrow: "You too?"
"Of course!"
Chen Xiaoling stepped forward and nodded, then looked at Su Nantian with suspicion: "Big Brother, are you sexist?"
Su Nantian smiled: "How could I? I'm just worried you can't endure the hardship."
In Su Nantian's eyes, Chen Xiaoling didn’t need to do this. However, if she wanted to, Su Nantian would not stop her.
He was just giving a warning in advance, reminding Chen Xiaoling to prepare for hardship.
The world requires sacrifice; learning a few moves is easy to say but difficult to do.
Otherwise, how could there be the saying "one minute on stage, ten years of training offstage?"
Chen Xiaoling immediately nodded: "I grew up in this harsh environment, I've endured many hardships. I'm not afraid."
After thinking about it, she told Su Nantian: "Big Brother, I'm not afraid of hardship. I just want self-defense skills and to avoid being a fish on the chopping block."
"Good, start tomorrow. Today, rest first."
Su Nantian thought about the major events of yesterday and knew they hadn't slept well. He saw dark circles under their eyes.
Thinking about this, he reminded them to go back and rest.
Moreover, he had other matters today; when Xiao Wang woke up, he would need to think about how to comfort him and calm his emotions.

Chapter 922: The Meaning of Death
"Go rest."
Su Nantian saw they didn’t move and reminded them again.
"What? You didn't hear me?"
Su Nantian saw they still stood there, their feet seemingly stuck to the ground. He raised an eyebrow in surprise and asked: "Don’t you go back?"
These people were never at peace for a moment.
Su Nantian was truly exasperated.
He wouldn’t vanish suddenly, so why were they so worried?
Moreover, Xiao Chen and others had no foundation. Even if they started training immediately, there would be no significant progress.
It was better to rest now and start learning from him later when they were well-rested.
Thinking about this, Su Nantian saw their expressions with more obvious disapproval and signaled them to go back immediately without thinking about these inappropriate thoughts.
"We don’t need rest, we’re not tired!"
Upon hearing Su Nantian’s words, they shook their heads immediately: "Big Brother, believe us. We can endure it. We can start now! Otherwise, those people don’t know when they’ll come!"
Xiao Chen and others immediately said to Su Nantian, hoping to learn quickly so they could help Su Nantian.
"Yes! Big Brother, we can all endure it!"
Xiao Chen and others nodded in agreement immediately. They refused to go back for rest.
After thinking about the villagers of Xiaoyu who were still unburied and died so tragically, how could they sleep soundly? Without avenging them for a day, they couldn’t truly be at ease.
"Big Brother."
Xiao Chen and others urgently spoke, trying to persuade Su Nantian.
Seeing this, Su Nantian raised his hand to stop them from speaking and did not let them continue.
"You..."
Su Nantian, hearing their urgency, was amused but upon thinking of the reason for their haste, his expression darkened slightly.
Su Nantian sighed and continued: "Haste makes waste. Have you never heard this saying?"
He shook his head at Chen Xiaoling and others: "Moreover, what can you learn in this state? Go back to sleep. Follow my arrangements."
Su Nantian spoke with an authoritative tone, giving the order.
"If you still want to learn, follow my arrangements."
Su Nantian saw they wanted to say more and interrupted their opinions, not letting them continue.
"Big Brother, we..."
Upon hearing Su Nantian's words, they knew his determination. They had wanted to say more but, seeing Su Nantian's resolute gaze, could only reluctantly nod in agreement.
"Then okay, Big Brother."
They all nodded unwillingly but dared not oppose Su Nantian's opinion. They followed his instructions and went back to rest.
Even on their way back, they took one step at a time, hoping Su Nantian would change his mind and call them back.
Seeing their behavior, Su Nantian was amused.
These people's actions were truly making him laugh.
Seeing this, Su Nantian could only wave his hand again to signal them to go back and stop thinking about other things.
Only then did they finally relax, no longer expecting anything else, and obediently ran back.
After calming them down, Su Nantian returned to his room and watched over Xiao Wang, waiting for him to wake up so he could comfort him properly.
But Su Nantian was still uneasy, unsure how to console Xiao Wang. He especially feared Xiao Wang would ask him where his grandfather was.
As Su Nantian was lost in thought about how to comfort Xiao Wang, Xiao Wang finally stirred and slowly opened his eyes. He rubbed them, still a bit dazed.
Upon seeing Su Nantian, he immediately smiled and said: "Uncle."
"Ah, Xiao Wang."
Su Nantian hadn’t been prepared at all. He saw Xiao Wang open his eyes and sit up on the bed.
Seeing this dazed Xiao Wang, Su Nantian's heart ached again. He was extremely angry at those people and wondered why they had been so cruel to kill Uncle Wang.
How would Xiao Wang cope from now on?
He had learned from Uncle Wang's words that Xiao Wang had no relatives left.
And he was raised by Uncle Wang, so thinking about Xiao Wang losing Uncle Wang made Su Nantian even more distressed. He couldn’t bear to tell the truth.
"Xiao Wang..."
Su Nantian pressed his lips together, hesitating to speak. He was at a loss for what to do.
He took a deep breath, calmed himself, and called Xiao Wang's name again, but upon seeing Xiao Wang’s eyes, he didn’t know what to say.
Especially, he couldn’t tell this cruel truth to Xiao Wang.
It was harder for Su Nantian to confront these villains than to tell the truth to this child. He couldn’t help but feel helpless in front of Xiao Wang, a child.
Su Nantian was truly thinking so hard he felt his head ache. How could he tell the truth to Xiao Wang without hurting him?
"Uncle, I know. Grandpa and other uncles have died, right?"
As Su Nantian was troubled, Xiao Wang suddenly spoke and said something that shocked Su Nantian.
He hadn’t expected even Xiao Wang to say this.
"You... do you understand the concept of death?"
Su Nantian was stunned, his words stammering.
He swallowed and looked at Xiao Wang in surprise, unsure how to react.
"Yes, I do."
Xiao Wang nodded obediently upon hearing Su Nantian's words and seeing his shocked expression.
"Grandpa told me before, I know."
Xiao Wang continued obediently: "Grandpa said that when parents died, they went to a distant place and would never return."
After saying this, Xiao Wang looked up at Su Nantian: "Then Uncle, did Grandpa go to the place where parents are?"
He stared at Su Nantian with big, dark eyes full of innocence and curiosity.
Xiao Wang seemed to need Su Nantian's explanation: "Uncle, tell me. I want to know."

Chapter 923: Taking Action
"Yes."
Su Nantian pressed his lips together again, hesitating to speak. He nodded solemnly and looked at Xiao Wang seriously.
He reached out to stroke Xiao Wang's round head, then said firmly:
"Xiao Wang, life is long yet short. Whether born or deceased, it's never as one wishes. But you must believe we will meet again somewhere."
Su Nantian's words were obscure, especially for a seven-year-old like Xiao Wang. This sentence was difficult to understand.
"Uncle, I don’t get it."
Xiao Wang quickly shook his head in confusion and looked at Su Nantian, waiting for an answer.
"You don’t need to understand. Just remember that when the right time comes, you will naturally comprehend this."
Su Nantian stroked Xiao Wang's head again and softened his voice, explaining gently.
"You just need to remember."
Su Nantian added another sentence, reminding Xiao Wang.
"Yes, Uncle, I remember!"
Xiao Wang nodded seriously and told Su Nantian obediently.
"Good."
Su Nantian smiled gently at Xiao Wang and said: "Now Grandpa has left. We will meet again, but not now. It'll be many years later, especially for Xiao Wang, who will have to wait longer."
Su Nantian explained the meaning of death with his words.
"Remember, you mustn’t rush to meet Grandpa; otherwise, he’ll be angry when he sees you."
Su Nantian added another reminder.
"But I miss Grandpa, what should I do?"
Xiao Wang pouted and said with a sad voice. At this point, his voice had already turned into a sob.
"I miss Grandpa so much..."
Upon saying this, Xiao Wang's mouth drooped and he couldn’t control his tears. He had moved from crying to now sobbing loudly.
"Good, Xiao Wang."
Seeing this Xiao Wang, Su Nantian was heartbroken. But he didn’t tell him to stop crying but instead hugged Xiao Wang and gently patted his back, letting him cry freely.
He was just a child who hadn’t lost the right to cry.
Moreover, Su Nantian wanted Xiao Wang to cry out and release his emotions instead of constantly restraining himself.
"Xiao Wang, be good. I’ll take care of you and always stay with you." Su Nantian continued to comfort him: "I’ll also be by your side to remember Grandpa."
He missed Uncle Wang too. Su Nantian had long wondered why Uncle Wang had such wise eyes and was so accepting of his origins.
Now he understood—Uncle Wang wasn’t from this isolated fishing village. He had seen the world's splendor but chose to hide here, away from the world, to protect Xiao Wang.
Uncle Wang's mission was complete; now it was Su Nantian’s turn to protect and care for Xiao Wang. He would do his best to keep him safe, never letting him face danger again.
Xiao Wang cried louder because of Su Nantian's comfort and gentle tone, as if he was crying out all his sorrows at once.
Although he was just a child, he seemed to have vaguely understood the feeling of losing Uncle Wang.
Xiao Wang thought about not seeing Uncle Wang again and couldn’t help but feel even more sorrow.
