After Su Nantian reached the door, these two security guards kept watching him closely, fearing he might attempt to sneak into Nangong Family's building again.

Su Nantian did not move forward but remained in a visible spot at the entrance, waiting for Nangong Yuyan's secretary to come and fetch him.

At that moment, Nangong Yuyan's secretary had also received instructions from her boss. Initially puzzled, the secretary recalled that just moments ago she was told to deny any knowledge of a man named Nantian. Yet now, she was ordered to go downstairs and meet him.

However, she dared not question further—after all, it was her boss's business. As a secretary, she only needed to fulfill her duties without meddling in matters beyond her role.

When the man arrived at the entrance, he noticed no one else was waiting in the lobby and directly approached the security guards. "Where is the man who said he wanted to see the president?" he asked.

Upon hearing this, the two security guards pointed toward Su Nantian outside and said, "He's there. He kept causing trouble earlier, demanding to see the president without proof. We had to send him away. At first, we thought he'd left, but now he's back at the entrance. Should we send him away again?"

The security guard finished speaking and immediately approached Su Nantian to escort him out. Unexpectedly, the secretary stepped forward and said, "No need. The president told me to bring him up."

Hearing this, the security guard was momentarily stunned. He hadn't expected this man's claims to be true.

Yet as low-level staff, they had no choice but to comply with the secretary's orders. The previous secretary waved at Su Nantian and said, "It's you, right? The president wants to see you."

Su Nantian nodded immediately and followed the secretary into Nangong Family's building. The two security guards watched him with resigned expressions.

After Su Nantian and the secretary entered the elevator, he casually remarked, "I heard the president was busy today. Did the meeting drain a lot of energy?"

"The president didn't have any meetings today, but he's definitely busy," the secretary replied without understanding Su Nantian's intent. Yet upon hearing this, Su Nantian smiled—his suspicions were confirmed.

Nangong Yuyan had indeed been angry at him, which was why she'd ignored him for so long and lied about being in a meeting. In truth, there had been no meeting at all.

The secretary led Su Nantian to the office door. She first signaled for him to wait outside and then knocked on the door, saying to Nangong Yuyan inside, "The president, Su Nantian has arrived. Would you like to see him?"

"Let him in directly," Nangong Yuyan replied. She set down her pen and glanced at the unfinished documents on her desk. Knowing Su Nantian's visit must be urgent, she set aside her work.

"President allows you to enter," the secretary said and opened the door. Su Nantian nodded in gratitude before stepping into Nangong Yuyan's office.

This was Su Nantian's first time entering Nangong Yuyan's office, and its layout was completely different from what he had seen before. It was entirely commercial in style.

"Miss," Su Nantian said, adopting a pitiful expression as Nangong Yuyan looked up at him.

Su Nantian knew he had come to show weakness, and he needed to make Nangong Yuyan feel his exhaustion under her punishment.

Seeing Su Nantian's miserable appearance, Nangong Yuyan was satisfied, believing her punishment had already taken effect.

"You've been waiting a long time outside, sit down," Nangong Yuyan said, gesturing to the sofa opposite her.

After Su Nantian sat down, Nangong Yuyan immediately asked, "Alright, tell me what you came for. You said there's trouble in the inland port—what exactly happened?"

Nangong Yuyan did not intend to mock Su Nantian further and immediately inquired about the matter.

Upon hearing Nangong Yuyan's question, Su Nantian quickly adjusted his demeanor and said, "Li Zhe is already on our side, right? He told me today that a batch of goods would arrive at the inland port soon. However, the quantity they planned to import was much larger than initially agreed. Normally, if the amount were smaller, these local gangsters would secretly pocket the storage fees. The Wu family has always turned a blind eye to this. But this time, the volume was massive. Zhang Yuan wanted them to follow the same practice of secretly taking fees. If they did, it would be a huge loss for us. However, if we intervened to stop them, their workers might rebel."

Su Nantian immediately relayed the day's events to Nangong Yuyan, as this was the most critical part.

Upon hearing this, Nangong Yuyan furrowed her brows. She hadn't expected the situation to be so complicated or for Zhang Yuan and his two accomplices to act so boldly. If Li Zhe hadn't defected to their side, they might still be unaware of this scheme and suffer a massive financial loss without realizing it.

"You're right," Nangong Yuyan said. "If we confront them forcefully, these local gangsters' workers would definitely react. This concerns their livelihoods. If we cut off this profit, they'd fight back against us."

Though Nangong Yuyan had always been a high-ranking lady, she understood this well. After all, to become the head of the Nangong family, one must not only master corporate strategies but also know how to pacify grassroots workers.

After all, the Nangong family had risen through the ranks by relying on these grassroots forces. Thus, they could never clash head-on with them. She also understood the true difficulty of Su Nantian's problem.

Chapter 608: The So-Called Display of Weakness

Seeing Nangong Yuyan's attitude, Su Nantian realized she had understood the stakes. Initially, he had been afraid that someone like Nangong Yuyan—used to a life of luxury—wouldn't grasp the sentiments of these grassroots workers. But now, seeing Nangong Yuyan's reaction, he realized his concerns were unnecessary.

"This situation is indeed complicated. If we ignore it, it would cause a significant loss to the Nangong family. However, if we rush in and act recklessly, it might backfire, leading to an unsatisfactory outcome. Therefore, we must find a thorough solution that recovers this loss while preventing these grassroots workers from rebelling."

As she spoke, Nangong Yuyan played with her pen, a habit she had when thinking.

"Because of this situation's uniqueness, I came directly to discuss it with you. Although a phone call could explain the issue, it's difficult to convey how to handle it specifically. Now I need you to decide quickly what we should do, as from what I know, the goods are arriving at the port in just a few days."

Though Li Zhe hadn't told Su Nantian the exact arrival time, his tone suggested it was imminent. Otherwise, he wouldn't have informed Su Nantian of this matter.

Moreover, this information had already been spread before Li Zhe defected to their side. After much deliberation, Li Zhe had decided to reveal it.

After hearing Su Nantian's words, Nangong Yuyan nodded heavily and said, "I understand. But I don't know how to respond at the moment. How can we recover our losses while pacifying these workers? I truly can't think of a perfect solution."

"Perhaps we could directly confront Zhang Yuan and his men, dividing the profits so they take part of it and we take another," Su Nantian suggested. However, he knew this idea wasn't great.

Sure enough, Nangong Yuyan immediately shook her head and waved her hand, saying, "No. If we do this, it's equivalent to bowing to these local gangsters. It would be openly dividing the profits with them, and our authority over the inland port would immediately weaken. The inland port's revenue for this year should belong to us. How could these local gangsters profit from it instead? This opportunity for Nangong Xia was meant to be profitable, but now it's become a benefit for Wu family's local gangsters."

Nangong Yuyan was resolute in her refusal to proceed this way.

In truth, Su Nantian had another idea within himself, but it was too risky for the Nangong family. Moreover, the Nangong family only controlled the port for a year. To change its structure for one year's profit was too complex.

Thus, Su Nantian didn't voice his idea because it was risky for the Nangong family. If they could maintain control over the inland port long-term, it would be worth the risk. But for just one year, it didn't seem worthwhile.

"Have you thought of any other solutions?" Nangong Yuyan asked again, as Su Nantian had previously shown great ability in handling other matters. She hoped he might have a solution this time too.

Su Nantian shook his head and said, "This issue is too complicated; I don't have any good ideas. That's why I came to you immediately."

"If that's the case, it seems we have no choice but to seek help..." Nangong Yuyan sighed helplessly after saying this. If the situation weren't so dire, she would never have considered seeking assistance. After all, asking for help equated to showing weakness, implying she was unable to handle this matter and revealing her inadequacy.

"Showing weakness?" Su Nantian heard this and felt a bit sensitive, as he had only entered Nangong Yuyan's office because of his timely display of weakness.

Yet Su Nantian didn't understand what Nangong Yuyan meant by "showing weakness." Did she mean that after showing weakness, the problem would be solved?

"Yes... that's what I meant," Nangong Yuyan said, then furrowed her brows. She seemed deeply reluctant but had no other choice since she truly couldn't find a solution and knew the issue would soon arrive. Thus, she had to choose this method.

"Miss, could you explain what 'showing weakness' means? Do you mean to show weakness to Zhang Yuan and his men? That wouldn't solve the problem, would it?" Su Nantian asked curiously. He was still intrigued by this concept of "showing weakness."

"Of course not as you think. What I mean by showing weakness is informing my father and letting him decide," Nangong Yuyan said, casting a glance at Su Nantian and revealing the true meaning of "showing weakness."

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian suddenly understood. This was what "showing weakness" meant, and he now grasped why Nangong Yuyan had acted that way.

At this point, the inland port's affairs were entirely under Nangong Yuyan's control. Meanwhile, Nan Gong Fei had also received the next project with Wu family. In short, both heirs of the Nangong family now had new projects underway.

So far, all decisions were made by themselves. Nangong Lin hadn't interfered at all. However, this time because Nangong Yuyan couldn't find a way to resolve the current problem without harming the family's interests, she had to seek her father's advice. This was what "showing weakness" meant—essentially, telling Nangong Lin that she lacked confidence and couldn't find a good solution, thus revealing her inadequacy.

For candidates vying for the inheritance, such "showing weakness" was terrifying, as it would directly impact their image in Nangong Lin's eyes.

Chapter 609: Already Figured It Out

After Su Nantian understood Nangong Yuyan's situation, he hesitated whether to tell her about his method. However, he felt that if he did, she might immediately reject it.

But in the end, Su Nantian said, "Actually, I have another idea, but I didn't mention it earlier because the cost is quite high."

"Tell me," Nangong Yuyan said, gesturing for Su Nantian to speak first so she could consider and refer to it.

Su Nantian nodded and said, "What we fear isn't these three local gangsters but their workers. These workers also profit from them. If we block this private deal, these workers would lose their livelihoods and harbor great resentment toward us. The chance of rebellion would be high."

Upon hearing this, Nangong Yuyan nodded. "You're right. We are considering this issue. If it weren't for these grassroots workers, we could easily use a strong approach to block them."

Nangong Yuyan understood this issue thoroughly. She naturally knew where the problem lay.

"So, if we could create conflicts among them and change their current structure, this issue might become easier to handle."

After saying this, Su Nantian paused slightly and looked at Nangong Yuyan, as if to see her reaction.

"You continue. How do you plan to change their structure? This is a big project," Nangong Yuyan anticipated Su Nantian's next words would far exceed her expectations.

"My plan isn't fully formed yet, but the idea is to create some conflicts among them. Since Li Zhe is now on our side and we have evidence of his previous cooperation with Wang Bo, no matter how we proceed, we can incite conflicts among these three men. Additionally, we could use Li Zhe's name to lure some workers to take sides. If they are motivated by profit, they would definitely switch allegiance to Li Zhe's side. Currently, Li Zhe holds the least power among these three local gangsters. However, if we can seize this opportunity, we would gain control over this private deal."

After Su Nantian finished speaking, he looked up at Nangong Yuyan and continued, "That's the general idea. However, since the Nangong family only controls the inland port for a year, I think this issue is quite complicated. Moreover, it's a structural change for the entire inland port, so maybe we shouldn't do this."

After hearing Su Nantian's plan, Nangong Yuyan nodded and said, "You're right. The Nangong family controls the inland port for only one year. After that, how it develops is irrelevant to us. So even if we completely disrupt their structure, there shouldn't be a problem."

Upon hearing Nangong Yuyan's words, Su Nantian's eyes lit up. It seemed she had implied something else in her statement, as if she had already agreed to his plan.

"So, Miss's meaning is..." Su Nantian looked at Nangong Yuyan with excitement. If they truly accepted his plan, it would be a complete transformation for the entire inland port.

Su Nantian had initially thought Nangong Yuyan would immediately approve and tell him to proceed with details. However, he hadn't expected Nangong Yuyan to shift her tone: "I think your plan is good, but we can't decide recklessly.

You know this plan would stir up a lot of interests. If the Wu family takes back the inland port and discovers its structure has completely changed, they might also be upset with us. Moreover, your plan sounds grand but is difficult to execute. Also, I've already decided to show weakness, so whether this plan is executed or not still needs to be discussed with my father. However, having this plan means my showing weakness isn't truly showing weakness."

Nangong Yuyan said this with a very happy expression. She had initially thought she would only seek her father's help, but now Su Nantian had another plan that was theoretically feasible.

But as Su Nantian said, since the Nangong family only controlled the inland port for a year, whether it was worth doing such a large-scale change and considering Wu family's future actions made it difficult to decide.

But once she had this plan, when meeting her father, it wouldn't be showing weakness but presenting an uncertain plan for consultation. This was fundamentally different from showing weakness.

"Let's go back now," Nangong Yuyan said and immediately tidied up the files on her desk. She stood up, put on her coat, grabbed her bag, and smiled mysteriously at Su Nantian. "You drove here, right? Just take me back."

Upon hearing this, Su Nantian was startled and felt awkward. It seemed Nangong Yuyan had already figured out his so-called "showing weakness."

Nangong Yuyan wasn't a fool. She knew Su Nantian wouldn't have stood outside the building without answering her call and definitely wouldn't have left as he said, just standing somewhere else to call her. Even if Su Nantian hadn't found a place to sit, he had driven here and could have stayed in the car instead of standing outside. Therefore, whether Su Nantian had done as he said was something Nangong Yuyan had already understood, but she hadn't confronted him yet.

After hearing Nangong Yuyan's words, Su Nantian could only scratch his head and laugh. He followed Nangong Yuyan out to her car.

Chapter 610: Never Admit Defeat

Su Nantian drove Nangong Yuyan back to the Nangong family. They directly arrived at the villa of Nangong Lin.

Although Nangong Lin hadn't fully retired, he still managed the family's affairs. However, he had gradually handed over his responsibilities to Nangong Ping and Nangong Yuyan. Even those not delegated were managed remotely, as the family's business was now very stable and didn't require daily presence. One just needed to stay informed about key details.

Therefore, upon returning to the Nangong family, they didn't worry about not finding Nangong Lin.

"You directly follow me to see father and explain today's events," Nangong Yuyan instructed Su Nantian, who sat beside her.

After hearing this, Su Nantian nodded and they both got out of the car.

As they approached the villa, the first person to greet them was Nangong Lin's butler.

This butler had previously been a trusted assistant to Nangong Lin in his business ventures. However, due to his age, he had stepped down from the front lines and now served as a butler in the Nangong family, managing internal and external affairs. He still offered advice on business matters to Nangong Lin.

Seeing Nangong Yuyan return, he warmly greeted her and said, "Miss, you're back. Why did you come so early today? This time is even earlier than your usual return time. What happened?"

Although his questions were frequent, Nangong Yuyan didn't find them intrusive. She knew this butler was one of her father's trusted people, and she had no complaints about him asking a few questions.

Nangong Yuyan smiled and said to him, "Indeed, something happened, so I had to return early to explain it to father. Is he resting now?"

Nangong Yuyan's attitude toward this butler was very gentle, which immediately made Su Nantian realize the butler's high status in the Nangong family. Although he had seen this butler before, he hadn't expected his status to be so high.

"The master is currently reading in the study. I'll go inform him immediately. You two can wait in the living room," he said and gestured for them to enter the living room first. Then, he went upstairs to call Nangong Lin.

"Master, the Miss has returned. She seems to have something important to say. She's waiting in the living room," the butler said directly upon entering the study without knocking, showing how much Nangong Lin trusted him.

"Understood. I'll come down," Nangong Lin said, raising his eyebrows slightly. He hadn't seen Nangong Yuyan rush to see him like this in a long time.

Moreover, Nangong Lin glanced at the clock on the wall. This was indeed earlier than Nangong Yuyan's usual return time, so he immediately deduced that something troubling must have happened.

Nangong Lin set down his book and walked downstairs. As he descended the stairs, he saw Nangong Yuyan sitting on a sofa and Su Nantian standing behind her.

Upon seeing Su Nantian, Nangong Lin raised an eyebrow. He was quite interested in Su Nantian, who now assisted both his son and daughter. He could also see that this young man's methods were indeed remarkable.

However, Nangong Lin hadn't yet confirmed whether this person was loyal to the Nangong family. Therefore, he had never dared to fully trust him and instead placed him in various positions to test his abilities and observe his loyalty.

At least now, Nangong Lin could judge that this person's methods were exceptional. If he truly helped either Nangong Ping or Nangong Yuyan, it would be a great asset for the Nangong family. But the key issue was that so far, after observing this matter, Nangong Lin hadn't found any faults in him. Yet he still couldn’t say this person was completely loyal to the Nangong family.

This was precisely what troubled Nangong Lin, as he felt that with his experience, he should have been able to determine this. Yet now it had happened.

Therefore, Nangong Lin felt this person was definitely not ordinary and couldn't fully trust him. He could only use him but not fully rely on him.

"Yuyan, why did you return so early? I heard you had something to say," Nangong Lin said as he held the handrail and walked down, speaking thus.

Upon hearing Nangong Lin's voice, Nangong Yuyan immediately stood up from the sofa and walked over to her father's side, hugging his arm as they both sat down on the sofa.

At this moment, Nangong Lin waved at Su Nantian and gestured for him to sit instead of standing.

Su Nantian nodded at Nangong Lin and sat on the sofa.

"Speak up, what's going on? If it weren't a big issue, you wouldn’t have come to me," Nangong Lin said. He knew his daughter well. If she could solve the problem herself, she wouldn’t have sought help from Nangong Lin. Even if it meant biting the bullet and struggling through, she would have resolved it herself.

In fact, Nangong Lin certainly understood why Nangong Yuyan acted this way. He felt both欣慰 (satisfaction) and a bit of sadness, knowing that the Nangong family's environment had forced her into this. He also understood that this was partly due to his own attitude.

Although he had always said the opportunity for the next heir was equal, some of his actions were clearly biased toward Nangong Ping.

While he had also cared for Nangong Yuyan at times, he considered that as his daughter, she would eventually marry and be taken in by her husband. Even if the husband was a son-in-law, there might still be issues of him seizing their Nangong family's assets.

Therefore, even though Nangong Ping was inferior to Nangong Yuyan in every aspect, Nangong Lin felt the risk was smaller.

Thus, even though he knew this approach wasn't good, he unconditionally favored Nangong Ping. This had made Nangong Yuyan develop an attitude of never admitting defeat.

Chapter 611: Several Methods

Nangong Lin thought about these matters and felt he had indeed treated Nangong Yuyan unfairly. Thus, his expression became more kind.

He also truly understood that this time was indeed a problem, otherwise Nangong Yuyan wouldn't have come to him.

"Now there's a technical issue in the inland port. We do have a plan, but the cost is too high. I came to ask you how to solve this," Nangong Yuyan said, explaining her purpose.

Nangong Lin patted Nangong Yuyan's hand and said, "Wu Chuan is a crook. He must have set many obstacles for you. It's natural that you couldn't handle it."

Nangong Lin said this to comfort Nangong Yuyan, telling her not to put too much pressure on herself and that it was acceptable to slightly yield to Wu Chuan.

But Nangong Yuyan's ears heard this, and it felt like Nangong Lin was belittling her strength. It seemed she couldn't beat Wu Chuan, and her strength was so weak.

Thus, Nangong Yuyan felt a bit不服气 (displeased) upon hearing this. However, she was truly unsure about the issue at hand and could only suppress her anger, pouting slightly before pretending nothing had happened.

This action confused Nangong Lin a bit. He was her father, and although he had been busy with work, he cared deeply about his two children's education and lives. He knew that when Nangong Yuyan pouted, it meant she had something unsatisfactory inside.

This made Nangong Lin unsure what was wrong with Nangong Yuyan, even making him think Wu Chuan had gone too far.

"It's not Wu Chuan this time, but his three local gangsters. I've told you before about the three local gangsters in the inland port, who have a group of workers under them."

Upon hearing this, Nangong Lin nodded as if recalling something and said, "I remember you mentioned they had three local gangsters. Is this time their doing? These people are really bold."

"Previously, Li Zhe defected to me. He was the weakest of these three local gangsters. This information came from him," Nangong Yuyan said, bringing up Li Zhe's role.

However, upon hearing this, Nangong Lin glanced at Li Zhe sideways but said nothing.

"It was this local gangster who informed us of the latest news: a batch of goods would arrive at the port soon. However, they secretly took extra fees for the excess volume compared to what was initially agreed. This is a huge loss for us. But you know, if we directly confront them and block their plans, it would definitely cause a rebellion."

Nangong Yuyan fully explained the situation. Upon hearing this, Nangong Lin's expression grew serious.

"You're right. If we use a strong approach, it would definitely recover our losses, but the result would be another huge loss. These local gangsters' workers are just trying to eat, and when they learn about this extra income, they would fight hard to get it. If we block their livelihoods, they would definitely rebel."

Nangong Lin didn't need to hear more. He could already foresee the consequences of this situation, so he agreed with Nangong Yuyan's statement. The Nangong family couldn't use a strong approach to block this matter, even if they could send most of their security forces to suppress these workers. Once a rebellion started, the consequences would be terrifying.

Even if Wu family's people could pacify these workers later, from then on, any work related to the Nangong family would be done with resentment. This would mean they wasted an entire year.

This would also mean their help for Wu Chuan was in vain, and they had done all this work for nothing.

Upon hearing Nangong Lin's words, Nangong Yuyan immediately said, "That’s why I came back to ask you how to deal with it. Now, no matter which method we choose, there are some drawbacks."

Upon hearing this, Nangong Lin sighed and continued, "A strong approach is definitely out of the question. But if we directly negotiate with these local gangsters to split the profits, it would be equivalent to us showing weakness to them. Then they would ride over our heads. This method is also not feasible."

"Moreover, we can't approach Wu family for help in this matter. From the beginning, they had this practice, which means Wu family turned a blind eye to it. If we ask for their help because of this issue, it would only make Wu Chuan think the Nangong family is useless and look down on us. This method is also absolutely not feasible," Nangong Yuyan continued, dismissing the second option.

"As for using violent methods, it's definitely not feasible. But I remember when you came, you said you two had a plan but the cost was too high. You should explain what kind of plan it is," Nangong Lin suddenly remembered what Nangong Yuyan had said when she came to see him. At that time, Nangong Yuyan clearly showed she had a plan but it was too difficult to execute.

Upon hearing this, Nangong Yuyan looked at Li Zhe and wanted him to explain the plan. However, Li Zhe shook his head slightly, indicating Nangong Yuyan should speak instead.

After all, Li Zhe didn't want to establish any achievements in front of Nangong Lin. Moreover, at this moment, his most important goal was to gain Nangong Yuyan's trust. For Li Zhe, the most direct thing was to win Nangong Yuyan's favor. If one day Nangong Yuyan became angry and exposed his identity, it would be a disaster for him.

Thus, Li Zhe preferred to let Nangong Yuyan present the plan in front of Nangong Lin.

Chapter 612: Refining the Plan

Nangong Yuyan knew Li Zhe's thoughts perfectly. This was a plan from the heavens, but she now let herself speak to take credit for it.

Moreover, Nangong Yuyan had previously discussed the concept of "showing weakness" with Li Zhe. As clever as Li Zhe was, he could understand Nangong Yuyan's current situation. Thus, Nangong Yuyan understood that Li Zhe was intentionally helping her.

But Nangong Yuyan didn't let herself be overly moved, as she knew Li Zhe had to flatter her now. After all, she had discovered a secret of his, and if she revealed it to Nangong Lin, Li Zhe's significance in the Nangong family would be destroyed.

Thus, it was understandable for Li Zhe to let her take credit.

But Nangong Yuyan ultimately didn't monopolize the idea but directly said to Nangong Lin, "Li Zhe has a plan. I think it's feasible, but as I said earlier, the sunk cost is quite high. It also feels a bit unnecessary or not worth it."

"Speak up, at least now there's a plan. If we can improve some of its drawbacks, it might overcome them," Nangong Lin said, becoming more interested.

At the same time, Nangong Lin turned to look at Li Zhe. His face had no expression, but it made Li Zhe shiver. Not only was Nangong Lin a veteran, but even without speaking, just glancing at him made Li Zhe feel his authority.

"According to Li Zhe's idea, we should disrupt the current structure of the entire inland port. For example, Li Zhe has been recruited to our side, but his power is the weakest among these three local gangsters.

If we could get other workers to join Li Zhe's side, and at the same time have leverage over him, he wouldn't be able to betray us in the short term.

Moreover, he would definitely understand that the Nangong family only has a year to control the inland port. If he expands his power with us during this year, it would be a win-win situation."
