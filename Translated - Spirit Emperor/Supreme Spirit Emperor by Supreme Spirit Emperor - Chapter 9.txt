“Snap…” A crisp sound of a slap echoed as Zhang Qi was sent flying backward, coughing up blood and landing on the ground in disbelief, staring at Luo Tian.

Zhang Qi never expected that a seemingly ordinary person with no visible aura fluctuations could send him flying. He realized he had encountered another formidable opponent, though not as cruel as the three black-robed men in the inn earlier. Nevertheless, it was still a formidable challenge.

“You dare to hit me?” Zhang Qi looked at Luo Tian in disbelief. Although he knew Luo Tian was formidable, his usual arrogance compelled him to ask.

“Snap…” Luo Tian silently cursed the fool and slapped Zhang Qi again, then lifted him up by the collar.

Zhang Qi’s guards were dumbfounded. They silently lamented that their young master had not consulted the almanac today, encountering only formidable opponents.

This young man was no ordinary person without aura fluctuations; he was clearly a master, and definitely of the Fifth Stage of Body Refinement or higher. They had not even realized what happened before their young master was lifted by someone.

“You cannot touch me! Otherwise, Father will not let you off easily! Father is the City Lord of Xuanyuan City. If you harm me, I guarantee that none of you will leave Xuanyuan City alive!” Zhang Qi, realizing he and his men were no match for Luo Tian, resorted to threatening with his father’s authority.

“How dare you threaten me? I hate it when people try to intimidate me!” Luo Tian held Zhang Qi by the collar and sneered.

“What must I do to be released?” Zhang Qi’s face fell when he realized his threats were ineffective, sighing inwardly at his misfortune.

“Hand over all the money on you and your men. Break both of your legs, and then you can leave!” Luo Tian placed Zhang Qi on the ground, confident that a mere Second Stage Body Refiner like him could not escape.

“You… don’t be too extreme. After all, this is Xuanyuan City!” Zhang Qi’s expression turned狰狞, having never suffered such humiliation before. First, he was frightened into fleeing and losing face, then being lifted by someone and thrown to the ground. It was a humiliation he had never experienced since birth.

“Boy, release our young master immediately or you will not leave Xuanyuan City alive!” The guards pledged their loyalty.

“Since you disagree with my proposal, I will have to handle it myself!” Luo Tian swiftly took Zhang Qi’s storage bag.

“Snap…” Two crisp sounds of bones breaking echoed as Luo Tian stomped on Zhang Qi’s legs with his foot.

Seeing Luo Tian actually cripple Zhang Qi, the guards felt a chill. They knew how much their city lord doted on Zhang Qi; even a scratch would warrant punishment, let alone crippled legs.

“Let’s go!” Luo Tian said to Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei as if nothing had happened, then walked out.

Due to Luo Tian’s formidable strength, the Fourth Stage Body Refiners did not dare utter a sound. By the time they recovered from their shock, Luo Tian and his companions had already left.

Chapter 19: The Elder of the Dai Clan

Luo Tian led Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei to a secluded corner, his expression serious. “Quickly leave! If I am not mistaken, the City Lord of Xuanyuan will arrive soon!”

Luo Tian dashed out first, followed by Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei. Their figures quickly disappeared from Xuanyuan City.

Not long after they left, several figures appeared in the inn. Leading them was a middle-aged man in his forties with deep eyes and an air of authority.

The man glared at Zhang Qi, who was groaning on the ground. “Who is the head guard?”

“Reporting to the City Lord, I am,” a Fourth Stage Body Refiner trembled as he stepped forward.

Zhang Xuantian glared at the head guard, who was immediately struck by a fiery palm. His entire head flew off his shoulders without resistance.

The guards were shocked, fearing they would be the next target. They all knelt down in submission.

“Find out who these two men and one woman are! How dare they cripple my son’s legs in Xuanyuan City!” Zhang Xuantian whispered to an ordinary-looking elder. “Uncle Dai, handle this personally! Capture them and deal with them as you see fit!”

The elder nodded without expression, his figure fading before the guards’ eyes.

Zhang Xuantian did not need to instruct further. He trusted Uncle Dai, who was even formidable against him. Uncle Dai excelled in tracking and could not be deceived by any trace.

Zhang Xuantian ordered Zhang Qi, who was unconscious after treatment, to be carried away. They headed towards the City Lord’s residence.

Luo Tian and his companions fled to a sparsely populated area. Gu Lei, already panting heavily from exhaustion, struggled to keep up with Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue.

“Why are we running? I haven’t taught that bastard a lesson yet!” Gu Lei complained.

“Shut up…” Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue spoke in unison, their eyes reflecting seriousness.

“You two are really默契!” Gu Lei muttered, then his expression turned grim as he saw an old man approaching slowly.

Gu Lei did not know who the old man was, but knew he was no ordinary person. The old man’s speed was astonishing; in a few moments, he stood before them.

“Seventh Stage Body Refinement!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed with relief. If it were Eighth Stage Zhang Xuantian, they would have no chance. Seventh Stage Body Refinement was formidable, but with the Five Elements Generating Human King Seal, they might have a chance to escape.

“Are you the ones who crippled our young master’s legs?” The old man landed lightly before Luo Tian, his eyes filled with疑惑. “How did a Fourth Stage Body Refiner like you manage such a feat?”

Luo Tian’s heart skipped a beat. The old man clearly considered him an ordinary person.

“If that is the case, our chances of survival increase!” Luo Tian thought to himself, but his face showed fear as he slowly hid behind Gu Lei.

“Intimidating a young boy? We are from the Ancient Family of Tianyuan City. Please, out of respect for our family, let us go!” Gu Qianxue saw Luo Tian retreating and guessed his plan. She began to stall the old man.

“Trying to buy time?” The old man sneered, unconcerned. In his view, any strategy was useless against overwhelming power.

“Attack!” Luo Tian growled, and Gu Qianxue unleashed her Great Sun Palm. Gu Lei threw a talisman, while Luo Tian activated the Flame Dragon Hand and Human King Seal.

Flames erupted as the old man was engulfed in flames, smoke billowing around him.

“Such martial techniques cannot harm me. Show me all you have! It has been a long time since I killed a genius. At such a young age, you have reached this境界, but you are still just infants!”

Just as the old man spoke confidently, a terrifying ripple appeared above him. A five-colored seal descended.

“Old dog! Taste this! Five Elements Generating Human King Seal!” Luo Tian roared.

“Boom…” Another terrifying explosion echoed.

“Damn! A cunning boy!” The old man cursed his carelessness, underestimating the young men. He was shocked by their identity; one of them could use a technique involving five elements.

Before he could react, the seal struck him directly. A deep crater formed as the old man collapsed like a dead dog, his eyes filled with不甘.

Luo Tian saw the fallen old man and felt a surge of joy. The old man had underestimated them, not realizing that even his formidable speed and Seventh Stage Body Refinement were no match for their combined efforts.

“Are you not satisfied? You are so old, yet defeated by us. I must say, you have lived in vain! Don’t you know the principle of a lion hunting a rabbit?” Luo Tian chuckled.

“Stop talking to this old fool! He is senile!” Gu Lei was elated, never expecting they could defeat a Seventh Stage Body Refiner.

The old man, insulted by Luo Tian and Gu Lei’s words, spat out blood and fainted.

Chapter 20: Gu Lei’s Crisis

Relieved that the old man had fainted, Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue sighed in relief. Gu Lei approached the old man.

“Amazing, Seventh Stage Body Refinement indeed! He survived a Five Elements Generating Human King Seal and merely fainted. Clearly, he is much stronger than Sixth Stage!” Gu Lei marveled as he searched the old man’s storage bag.

“Let’s go. We have expended much energy; if more people come, we are done for!” Gu Qianxue urged as Gu Lei lingered.

Gu Lei raised his fist to finish the old man, but suddenly, the old man’s eyes snapped open. He spat out a bloodline that struck Gu Lei in the chest, sending him flying.

The old man left a trail of残影 and disappeared. “You will pay for this! I will seek revenge!”

Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue rushed to Gu Lei’s side, seeing a purple mark on his chest.

“Poisoned!” They thought simultaneously. Gu Qianxue looked求助ly at Luo Tian.

“What should we do?” Luo Tian was焦急, as Gu Lei was like a brother to him.

“First, we need to identify the poison. Give him some basic healing medicine,” Luo Tian instructed.

Luo Tian closed his eyes, recalling the Hundred Chapters of Alchemy and Herbs. It contained information on poisons, but he had not paid much attention to it before.

“Wrong… wrong…” Luo Tian’s mind raced through names and symptoms of poisons.

Finally, after half an hour, he exclaimed, “Found it!”

“What is the poison?” Gu Qianxue asked anxiously as Gu Lei’s condition worsened.

“Sevenfold Devouring Essence Poison!” Luo Tian sighed, frustrated that the old man had such a deadly poison.

“Sevenfold Devouring Essence Poison” means the victim has seven days to live. Without an antidote, they will be devoured by their essence and die.

Gu Qianxue felt a pang of guilt. If Gu Lei died, how could she face her father? As his elder sister, she had failed to protect him.

“Is there a cure?” Gu Qianxue asked hopefully.

“Yes, the first method is to have a Body Refiner above Fifth Stage expel the poison with their essence. The second method is to find a medicinal pill or herb that can refine and purify the toxins,” Luo Tian explained.

Gu Qianxue’s hopes dimmed. In Tianyuan City, they could find a solution, but in Xuanyuan City, it was impossible to find such resources.

“Refine the essence… refine the essence…” Luo Tian repeated, then had an epiphany. “Taiyin Marrow Cleansing Grass!”

“Taiyin Marrow Cleansing Grass?” Gu Qianxue looked puzzled.

“There might be hope. Let’s find a place to settle down and discuss our next move,” Luo Tian said.

Relieved, Gu Qianxue followed Luo Tian to a nearby village. Fortunately, the villagers were kind-hearted and allowed them to stay.

That evening, Luo Tian shared his plan with Gu Qianxue. He would infiltrate Xuanyuan City and participate in the auction, hoping to obtain Taiyin Marrow Cleansing Grass.

“No! It’s too dangerous. They probably have our portraits all over the city, and they might search this village soon,” Gu Qianxue refused.

“Don’t pretend you are not thinking about it. You want to go yourself, don’t you? Who is stronger between us?” Luo Tian teased.

Gu Qianxue blushed, remembering her father often calling her mother a fool when she was young.

Seeing Gu Qianxue blush, Luo Tian thought he had said too much and softened his tone. “Gu Lei is not only your brother but also my brother, and I am a man!”

Gu Qianxue was touched. She nodded obediently, surprising even herself.

That night, a golden light filled Luo Tian’s room. The couple who had taken them in knelt and prayed, but Gu Qianxue calmed them down.

In the City Lord’s residence of Xuanyuan City, Zhang Xuantian sat in the center with his son and Uncle Dai.

Zhang Xuantian was furious. He had sent Uncle Dai to track down the three young men who injured his son, only for him to return severely wounded.

“How could Uncle Dai, capable of holding his own against me, be defeated by three young men? Who are they? Could they be disciples from a major sect? Xuanyuan City is close to the Five Elements Sect. Could they be their disciples?”

Zhang Xuantian dismissed this thought, as Five Elements Sect disciples always wore sect robes.

“Find them! No matter what, find their whereabouts. Even if they are from a major sect, no one can harm my son in Xuanyuan City and escape unscathed!”

Chapter 21: Re-entering Xuanyuan City

The next morning, Luo Tian dressed in farmer’s clothes and pretended to go to the city to sell vegetables.

Fortunately, his appearance was unremarkable, fitting perfectly with a rural youth.
