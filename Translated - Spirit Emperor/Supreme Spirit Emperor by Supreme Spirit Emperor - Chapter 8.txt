“Upon our first meeting, Senior Brother captured them and presented them to you as a token of greeting. How will you deal with them?” Lei Yong kicked off the ground and dashed towards Shi Taiping like a bolt of lightning, while Ji Chen transformed into a wisp of black smoke and drifted towards Li Xiuping.

“Ah!” Shi Taiping did not expect Lei Yong to act so abruptly, without even giving him a chance to prepare. Before he could react, Lei Yong had subdued him and sealed his cultivation, then tossed him at Luo Tian’s feet.

“Hmph! Shi Taiping, Shit太平, what a unique name you have!” Lei Yong, having nothing better to do, began mocking Shi Taiping’s name.

Li Xiuping saw the black smoke drifting towards him and his expression turned grave. He reached into his robes and drew out a long blade, swinging it forcefully at the smoke.

“Yellow Rank weapon!” Luo Tian, who had never seen a Yellow Rank weapon before, could not help but feel anxious.

Yellow Rank weapons were even rarer than Yellow Rank techniques and martial arts. Luo Tian had never seen a Yellow Rank weapon, so he did not know how formidable it was.

A massive blade aura sped towards Ji Chen, leaving a deep trench in its wake.

Ji Chen’s eyes flashed with killing intent as a cold voice issued from the pale purple lips: “Frog at the bottom of a well, overestimating your abilities!”

Seeing Luo Tian’s concern, Lei Yong, who had been standing beside him all along, smiled reassuringly: “Don’t worry. Third Brother’s strength is formidable even I find it hard to match him. Much less a mere Eighth Layer Body Refiner like you! But I suspect Third Brother has already decided to kill them.”

Lei Yong was not wrong. While Li Xiuping was a prodigy, he paled in comparison to Lei Yong and Ji Chen, who were exceptional even among the Five Elements Sect’s prodigies. To them, Li Xiuping was nothing more than a joke.

The blade aura reached Ji Chen in an instant, but he stood still as if he had not seen it.

“Residual shadow!” Li Xiuping inwardly cursed, but it was too late. A cold aura rose behind him, and he could not resist as Ji Chen lifted him up, sealed his cultivation, and threw him before Luo Tian like Shi Taiping.

Witnessing such a dramatic turn of events, the onlookers were left speechless. Li Xiuping, who had been dominating Luo Tian and driving him to a corner, was suddenly thwarted by these two formidable figures.

Luo Tian looked down at the fallen Li Xiuping and chuckled: “I never thought you would come to this!”

“I know, you will let me go,” Li Xiuping shook his head. Though he no longer had the same air of confidence, he remained calm and composed.

Hearing Li Xiuping’s words, Luo Tian felt a surge of killing intent. Li Xiuping was too clever; he had anticipated that Luo Tian would not kill him but let him go. If Luo Tian killed him, he would always be haunted by a demon in his heart, which would hinder his future cultivation.

“You may go! Tell Chen Yunting and the Discipline Hall Elder that I will return to Flying Cloud Sect in half a year to seek retribution for my crippled cultivation. Then, I will personally defeat you!” Luo Tian said coldly.

After speaking, Luo Tian could no longer hold on and fainted.

…

For the past thirty years, Li, Gu, and Wang families had controlled Tian Yuan City. However, no one could have imagined that the most powerful Li family would fall into ruin because of a young man.

Luo Tian, who had been virtually unknown just months ago, completely changed the landscape of Tian Yuan City in a matter of months.

At this moment, in an elegant courtyard of the Gu family, a young man was staring at a broken spear tip while a plump man beside him scratched his head, clearly wanting to interrupt but feeling awkward.

“Huff…” Luo Tian sighed deeply.

“What purpose does this Li family spear tip serve? Why do I feel something is off about it, and why did the Annals of Eons react when we first discovered it?” Luo Tian muttered to himself.

“Ah… why is Brother Tian still looking at this useless thing? Give it up! If it were valuable, Li Xiuping would have taken it long ago. Come on, your father is looking for you,” Gu Lei said loudly.

“Alright, what’s the matter? Father wants to see me?” Luo Tian replied gently, his gaze leaving the spear tip as he followed Gu Lei towards the reception hall.

In the Gu family’s reception hall, all important members of the Gu family were present, waiting for Luo Tian.

Gu Qianxue, the pride of the Gu family, stood beside Gu Yun and unconsciously looked outside. She did not know why, but lately, a shadow had been flickering in her heart.

“Ah, my daughter has taken a fancy to someone. Better act on it!” Gu Yun teased.

Gu Qianxue’s face flushed slightly, but soon returned to its usual serious expression. She asked in a low voice: “Father! When will you tell me about Mother?”

Hearing Gu Qianxue mention her mother, Gu Yun’s expression turned melancholic: “Qianxue, I know you miss your mother. But I promise, once you reach the Spirit Core Realm, I will tell you about her.”

“Oh!” Gu Qianxue replied indifferently but with a determined look on her face.

Luo Tian and Gu Lei arrived at the reception hall, chatting merrily. When Luo Tian saw so many people gathered, his expression turned solemn.

Seeing Luo Tian arrive, the Gu family members showed him great respect. Without him, the Gu family might have ceased to exist.

“Father, what brings you to see me?” Luo Tian smiled and greeted Gu Qianxue with a nod, grateful for her risking her life to protect him earlier.

“Ah, we want to discuss our departure for the Five Elements Sect. It’s almost the first day of next month, and you should be recovered by now?” Gu Yun smiled.

Luo Tian sighed in relief: “Yes, I am fine. It’s time to meet my long-lost master! The Five Elements Sect must be full of interesting things!”

Chapter 17: Xuantian City

Xuantian City is located in the eastern part of the Great Peace Forest. Although it is larger than Tian Yuan City, unlike the three families that control Tian Yuan City, Xuantian City is ruled solely by the Zhang family.

Zhang Xuantian, the ruler of Xuantian City, is an Eighth Layer Body Refiner. No martial artist dares to cause trouble in Xuantian City, and its most famous feature is the Xuantian Auction.

The Xuantian Auction takes place once a year and is renowned throughout the northern region. Every auction, countless experts gather in hopes of acquiring suitable treasures.

At this moment, on the broad streets of Xuantian City, two men and a woman were leisurely strolling. The woman’s high bun and delicate features drew many glances, but when people noticed the plump man beside her, their interest waned.

Although the plump man was not unattractive, walking with such a beautiful girl made him seem out of place.

The other young man wore coarse clothes and showed no signs of cultivation. A pale green jade pendant hung from his waist, emitting a faint glow. If someone knowledgeable saw it, they would be astonished at the young man’s identity, as such a large jade pendant made from Nourishing Heart Jade was rare.

A grain-sized piece of Nourishing Heart Jade could sustain a common family for a lifetime, so it was remarkable that the young man had such a pendant. Clearly, he held a special status.

“Finally! We’ve reached Xuantian City. I’m exhausted! Luo Tian, let’s find a place to stay,” Gu Lei complained.

Gu Qianxue also wiped her forehead, clearly uncomfortable with the journey’s hardships.

Seeing both of them tired, Luo Tian nodded and they found a clean inn to stay at. They then went to a decent restaurant, where the three of them, as part of one of Tian Yuan City’s two major families and wealthy alchemists, ordered a sumptuous meal.

Gu Lei ate voraciously while Gu Qianxue was more refined. Luo Tian sipped his wine and extended his consciousness to gather information about the Xuantian Auction.

“Did you hear? This auction will feature a Mystic Rank technique, and the other city rulers have already arrived. I also heard there’s a Taiyin Marrow Cleansing Grass for sale!” Luo Tian, extending his consciousness, heard people discussing the auction and was startled.

Luo Tian was not interested in the Mystic Rank technique but was intrigued by the Taiyin Marrow Cleansing Grass. The second page of the Annals of Eons mentioned a third-grade pill, Marrow Cleansing Pill, whose main ingredient was Taiyin Marrow Cleansing Grass.

Processing the grass and applying it to one’s body could refine one’s physique, while the Marrow Cleansing Pill was an advanced version that not only refined the body but also removed impurities from bones and internal organs.

“If conditions allow, I might bid for the Taiyin Marrow Cleansing Grass. With my current physical strength, another refinement might push me to an extraordinary level!” Luo Tian muttered.

As he listened to the discussions, a domineering voice interrupted: “This young master is here for dinner. All others should leave!”

The bustling restaurant fell silent as people recognized the voice and began leaving their seats.

“Brother, let’s go. Zhang Qi has arrived!” A middle-aged man advised Luo Tian and his companions, who showed no intention of leaving.

Luo Tian and the others frowned at the arrogant voice. Gu Lei cursed under his breath, while Gu Qianxue merely raised an eyebrow and continued eating.

Soon, most people left their seats, leaving only a few tables, including Luo Tian’s. He noticed one table in particular.

The most striking feature of the table was that all three people wore black robes with a crescent moon emblem on their chests, though the fullness of the moons varied.

“Hmph, someone really has no eyes. This young master is here for dinner and you don’t even make way? Get out, I’ll have your legs broken!” A young man in his twenties swaggered in, his steps unsteady and clearly indulged in wine and women.

After Zhang Qi’s words, he scanned the room. When his gaze fell on Gu Qianxue, his eyes were captivated.

Zhang Qi had seen countless women since birth but never one as beautiful as Gu Qianxue. He exclaimed his good fortune and approached their table, while his entourage moved towards the remaining tables.

“Beautiful lady, why are you eating alone? I am Zhang Qi. My father is the ruler of Xuantian City. Would you like to have dinner with me?” Zhang Qi sat beside Luo Tian, assuming a pose he thought was charming.

“Ew…” Gu Lei spat out the meat in his mouth at Zhang Qi’s approach.

“Get out,” a cold voice issued from Gu Qianxue, accompanied by an imposing aura.

Though Zhang Qi was the son of Xuantian City’s ruler, his cultivation was far behind. At over twenty years old, he was only a Second Layer Body Refiner and relied heavily on medicinal pills. He could not withstand Gu Qianxue’s aura, retreating several steps.

Zhang Qi had always been pampered and indulged since childhood. He was used to getting whatever he wanted, never facing any resistance.

Seeing Gu Qianxue’s indifference, Zhang Qi’s eyes turned vicious: “Hmph, ungrateful. What’s so special about being a Fourth Layer Body Refiner? Capture this girl for me.”

Zhang Qi’s entourage, all Fourth Layer Body Refiners, moved towards Luo Tian and the others. Since Gu Qianxue was their highest cultivator and the other two were ordinary, Luo Tian, who showed no signs of cultivation, was ignored.

Luo Tian sighed inwardly. The saying “beauty is a curse” rang true. He stood before Gu Qianxue, ready to act.

“Get out…” Just as Luo Tian was about to intervene, a domineering voice rang out, followed by a cry of pain.

Zhang Qi, who had been certain of victory, turned to see the most brutal scene he had ever witnessed: a Fourth Layer Body Refiner’s upper body exploded, including his bones, spraying blood mist everywhere.

Though Zhang Qi was slightly farther away, he was still affected. He felt something like mud on his face and saw it turn red.

Chapter 18: Escape

“Ah!” Zhang Qi stood frozen, and the restaurant fell silent for a moment. Soon, he screamed in terror and fled outside, no longer interested in harassing Gu Qianxue.

The guards followed their master’s lead and fled, seeing the three black-robed figures as demons. They did not want to stay a moment longer.

Gu Lei, witnessing the gruesome scene, felt his stomach churn. Others nearby could not hold back and vomited, causing a chain reaction throughout the restaurant. Even Gu Qianxue, usually aloof, lost her composure and vomited.

Luo Tian watched the three black-robed figures eating calmly, feeling a sudden sense of danger.

Since meeting his second and third senior brothers, Luo Tian knew that the Tian Yuan Continent had various unique physiques. His second brother was a Lightning Attribute Physique, and his third brother possessed the rare Dark Attribute.

But Luo Tian could not fathom what kind of physiques these three had. Their mysterious nature and casual killing further chilled him.

The three seemed to sense Luo Tian’s gaze, turning their eyes towards him. This glance stirred a storm in his heart.

The long-silent Annals of Eons began to emit golden light. Luo Tian tried to suppress it but failed.

Just as he was about to lose control, the jade pendant at his waist emitted a faint green glow, and the Annals of Eons stopped shaking.

Though shocked inside, Luo Tian remained calm. He grabbed Gu Lei with one hand and pulled Gu Qianxue with the other, heading downstairs as if they were afraid Zhang Qi would return for revenge.

Reaching their inn, Luo Tian checked his surroundings with his consciousness and found no one following. He then let go of them, entering the room amidst their puzzled looks.

Closing the door, Luo Tian pondered: “Who are these three people? Why did they cause a reaction in the Annals of Eons? Who is my mysterious master, and why does the jade pendant he gave me not only conceal cultivation but also suppress the Annals of Eons?”

As Luo Tian muttered, commotion outside grew louder. Gu Lei’s anxious voice rang out: “Luo Tian! My sister is fighting with the people of Xuantian City!”

Hearing Gu Lei, Luo Tian frowned. He had no intention of clashing with the Zhang family of Xuantian City, as Zhang Xuantian was an Eighth Layer Body Refiner, far stronger than Li Xiuping and much more powerful than himself.

“Hmph, I did not want to escalate matters, but since they have provoked us, how can we not retaliate? Since Gu Qianxue could withstand their attack, it means the city ruler did not come!” Luo Tian thought as he stepped outside.

Gu Qianxue was surrounded by Fourth Layer Body Refiners. After informing Luo Tian, Gu Lei stood before her, facing Zhang Qi, who acted like a prince of Xuantian City.

“Hehe, beautiful lady, I almost forgot about you. But it’s not too late; as long as you’re in Xuantian City, you can’t escape my grasp!” Zhang Qi grinned confidently.

“Oh? Then let’s not run today,” Luo Tian said coolly, joining Gu Qianxue.

Seeing Luo Tian approach without any cultivation aura, Zhang Qi sneered: “Beautiful lady, what useless companions you have. Your bodyguard is just an ordinary person; people might think he’s your kept man. But your taste isn’t great!”
