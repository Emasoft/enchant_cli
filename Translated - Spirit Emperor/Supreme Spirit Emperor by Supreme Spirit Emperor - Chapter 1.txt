Chapter One: The Book of Eons


In the Tianyuan Continent, at the Flying Cloud Sect.


A group of young men in gray robes continuously shoved a slender youth until they pushed him out the mountain gate and onto the ground.


One of the leading youths looked down at the slender youth with disdain, saying, “Luo Tian, your courage is truly remarkable. A mere Level One Body Refinement waste dared to offend Senior Brother Li, you really don’t know how to write the word ‘death’!”


Luo Tian endured the intense pain in his body and struggled to get up, his eyes tightly fixed on those before him, etching their ugly faces into his memory. He would remember each and every one of these people who had insulted him today.


“Wang Fan, go back and tell Li Xiuping everything that happened today. If I Luo Tian ever rise again, I will return it all tenfold!” Luo Tian’s tone was as cold as a thousand-year-old ice, but the flames of anger in his eyes burned like heavenly fire, causing Wang Fan to involuntarily shudder.


“A cripple with shattered meridians still wants revenge on Senior Brother Li? Wait until your next life!” Wang Fan snorted coldly, filled with anger due to his fear of Luo Tian. However, he truly meant what he said about the next life; he knew that Luo Tian was as good as dead.


Li Xiuping was not someone who would show mercy. Once he had taken action against Luo Tian, there was no way he would let him live.


Wang Fan and the others turned to leave, the massive mountain gate slowly closing behind them, leaving Luo Tian, covered in injuries, standing alone.


Luo Tian silently gazed at the tightly closed mountain gate, recalling recent events. His fists clenched involuntarily, his nails digging into his palms without him realizing it. He subconsciously called out a name—Chen Yunting!


Chen Yunting and Luo Tian grew up together, playing as childhood friends. They were both chosen to enter the Flying Cloud Sect and became a couple envied by all in their village.


However, after entering the Flying Cloud Sect, Chen Yunting fell for Li Xiuping, a direct disciple of the sect. Luo Tian was beaten to the point where his meridians were shattered and expelled from the Flying Cloud Sect under a false accusation. He could not understand why this gentle girl he had grown up with would change so much.


In one day, Luo Tian’s hopes for love, his longing for immortality, and his pursuit of martial arts all crumbled. He became a cripple with shattered meridians, leaving him filled with hatred.


“Chen Yunting, you have abandoned me and betrayed our feelings. From today onwards, we are strangers! Li Xiuping, you have ruined my cultivation; I swear to avenge this wrong. Flying Cloud Sect, your treatment of me is unjust; one day I will make you all regret it!” Luo Tian growled, silently vowing to make everyone who had wronged him pay.


After a deep look at the mountain gate, Luo Tian turned and left the mountain, heading straight for the Daan Forest.


The Daan Forest was vast and lush, filled with ferocious beasts and danger. Yet it also held countless opportunities. Luo Tian was determined to risk everything, entering the Daan Forest in search of an opportunity to heal his shattered meridians.


Otherwise, on this continent where martial arts reign supreme, Luo Tian would not only be unable to seek revenge but might even struggle to survive.


Throughout his journey, Luo Tian was extremely cautious, afraid of startling the dangerous beasts. However, he found it strange that after walking for an entire hour, even as he entered the depths of the Daan Forest, he did not encounter a single beast.


This should have been cause for celebration, but Luo Tian felt it was extremely eerie. He knew that the Daan Forest was not lacking in ferocious beasts, especially within its depths; this situation was clearly abnormal.


Even more bizarrely, Luo Tian did not just fail to see any beasts; he saw no living creatures at all. The entire forest was deathly silent, so quiet that Luo Tian could hear his own breath.


“Could something have happened in the Daan Forest?” Luo Tian was puzzled, finding this situation too strange. Yet it also presented him with the best opportunity; in his current state, he would never have been able to venture so deep.


Luo Tian gritted his teeth and stepped forward. Soon, he discovered a small pond ahead. The pond was bottomless, with cold mist rising from its surface, causing frost to form within a ten-zhang radius.


“Pool of Forgetfulness!” Luo Tian exclaimed in shock, fear evident in his eyes.


The Pool of Forgetfulness was a taboo within the Daan Forest. Each time it appeared, death followed; anyone or animal that entered was instantly frozen and never emerged alive. It was a place of death.


Even more terrifying, the Pool of Forgetfulness could move constantly, appearing anywhere within the Daan Forest at any time. It was far more dangerous than ferocious beasts.


As Luo Tian looked at the Pool of Forgetfulness, fear welled up in his eyes. Just as he turned to leave, a mocking voice sounded from behind him: “Boy, you’ve chosen quite the fitting grave!”


Luo Tian was startled and quickly turned around to find two guards standing behind him, both looking at him with derision.


“Did Li Xiuping send you?” Luo Tian had few enemies, and it was not difficult to guess who wanted him dead. His hatred for Li Xiuping deepened.


“Congratulations, you guessed right, but I still have to torment you to death; otherwise, I won’t be able to account for it when I return!” The taller and thinner of the two sneered, sizing Luo Tian up as if considering how to kill him.


“Li Xiuping actually sent two Level Two Body Refinement cultivators to kill a cripple like me; he must think highly of me!” Luo Tian gritted his teeth, filled with resentment.


“Alright, boy, since you’re going to die anyway, why don’t I have some fun first? It’s been a long time since I’ve had fresh meat!” The fat one grew impatient, his face revealing a lecherous smile as he slowly approached Luo Tian, like a cat eyeing its prey.


The thin guard saw the fat one’s smile and knew his intentions. Everyone in the Li family was aware of the fat guard's special preference for men; the thin guard suspected that Li Xiuping had sent him with this in mind!


“Hey, Fatso, be careful; his frail body might not withstand your advances!” The thin guard laughed, clearly having witnessed the fat guard’s misdeeds before.


After his cultivation was destroyed, Luo Tian's body was weaker than an ordinary person. Hearing their words, he felt goosebumps rise on his skin.


Thinking of falling into the hands of this pervert, Luo Tian was filled with hatred—hatred for Chen Yunting, the Flying Cloud Sect, and Li Xiuping. He also hated his own weakness; otherwise, he would not have suffered such humiliation.


“I’d rather die than suffer this humiliation!” Luo Tian gritted his teeth and turned around, leaping directly into the Pool of Forgetfulness, a place said to be impossible to survive.


Seeing Luo Tian jump into the Pool of Forgetfulness, the fat guard was懊恼地拍着大腿，but he dared not jump in to retrieve him, and could only curse here.


“The boy falling into the Pool of Forgetfulness will definitely not survive; we can go back and report now!” Seeing no more entertainment, the thin guard immediately reminded his companion. After all, the Pool of Forgetfulness was infamous; even from a distance, it could cause one to feel fear.


Although the fat guard was unwilling, he knew that the situation was beyond his control and could only follow the thin guard as they rushed out of the Daan Forest.


The Pool of Forgetfulness was bone-chillingly cold. As soon as Luo Tian fell in, ice formed on his body. He struggled to maintain his consciousness but felt his soul freeze, quickly losing control and falling unconscious.


At this moment, a suction force suddenly emerged from the bottom of the Pool of Forgetfulness, dragging the unconscious Luo Tian to the cold pond’s depths. Alongside him were a steel-backed ferocious wolf and a five-colored deer, both frozen solid for reasons unknown.


Not long after, a golden book slowly emerged from the bottom of the pond, continuously emitting golden light and enveloping the steel-backed ferocious wolf.


In an instant, the steel-backed ferocious wolf burst into pieces, turning into countless blood clots. A crack appeared, and the wolf’s essence blood quickly flowed in.


The golden book repeated this process with the five-colored deer, which also turned into blood clots like the wolf. After absorbing the five-colored deer’s essence blood, the golden book slowly moved towards Luo Tian.


Unexpectedly, when the golden light enveloped Luo Tian, the golden book trembled and then directly entered his head…


During this time, a significant change occurred in the Daan Forest. The ferocious beasts that were usually fierce now cowered in dark corners, whimpering softly.


The five elements’ primordial energy above the Daan Forest began to stir violently. The star-filled night sky instantly became overcast, with large raindrops falling from the sky.


And the mysterious Pool of Forgetfulness where Luo Tian had jumped in—the bone-chilling water was visibly disappearing.


In the city of Tianyuan, an old man with white hair looked in the direction of the Daan Forest, his eyes filled with excitement: “Primordial energy turning into rain! It has been three thousand years, and finally, I have found you, the Book of Eons!”


After speaking, the old man vanished from the room without causing any disturbance, as if the room had never been occupied.


For the ferocious beasts of the Daan Forest, it was a sleepless night. But the one who caused all this was quietly sleeping and silently transforming.


Chapter Two: Tianyuan City


At dawn, the fiery sun rose from the east, releasing its light and heat. Sunlight filtered through the gaps in the trees, leaving斑驳的痕迹 on the damp ground. The sunlight fell on Luo Tian's face, finally waking him from his unconscious state.


“I’m still alive!” Luo Tian looked around in confusion and found himself at the bottom of the Pool of Forgetfulness. However, it could no longer be called a cold pond; all its water had dried up, leaving only a damp pit.


Luo Tian quickly checked his body and discovered that not only had all his injuries healed, but even his shattered meridians were restored to their original state.


“This… my meridians are actually healed, and my cultivation has even reached Level Two Body Refinement!” Luo Tian felt dizzy, everything feeling like a dream, so unreal.


Unable to believe it, he pinched himself hard. The intense pain confirmed that this was not a dream.


“No! Why is the earth attribute primordial energy, which should be brown, now colorful? And why do I feel much stronger than the two Level Two Body Refinement cultivators I encountered yesterday?” Luo Tian moved his body and quickly noticed the abnormalities within him.


In the Tianyuan Continent, there were five types of primordial energy: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. Only those who could sense the primordial energy could cultivate; the more types of primordial energy one could sense, the higher their cultivation talent.


Ordinary cultivators like Luo Tian could only sense one type of primordial energy. Those who, like Li Xiuping, could sense two types would become core or even direct disciples of various sects.


Even though Luo Tian had only gained one additional type of primordial energy, his talent and strength had improved dramatically.


Now, Luo Tian could sense all five types of primordial energy within his body. He stood there in shock, overwhelmed by this unexpected development.


He could not imagine how extraordinary a five-attribute talent was. Luo Tian knew that if he returned to the Flying Cloud Sect, the elders would vie for him as a disciple. With his newfound power, he could easily destroy Li Xiuping.


“Li Xiuping, you never expected me to still be alive! Wait for me; I will give you a big surprise!” Luo Tian clenched his fists, filled with excitement. But then he became puzzled, wondering how he had become a legendary five-attribute cultivator after just sleeping.


After carefully examining his body, Luo Tian discovered a golden book continuously emitting golden light in his sea of consciousness.


“Could this golden book have turned me into a five-attribute cultivator? If so, how extraordinary must it be? I’ve never heard of anything that can change one’s innate constitution!” Luo Tian was shocked, realizing he had truly hit the jackpot. It was a huge one that could make the entire Tianyuan Continent go wild.


Luo Tian secretly decided to keep this golden book a secret, not letting anyone else know about it.


Knowing the book’s uniqueness, he tried to figure out how to use it. No matter what he did, the golden book remained unresponsive.


Finally, Luo Tian tried to touch it with his spiritual sense. The entire book glowed brightly, revealing the words "Book of Eons." A complex set of cultivation techniques appeared in his mind.


This technique was called the Five Elements Primordial Transformation Art, a unique cultivation method for those with five-attribute constitutions. Most surprisingly, Luo Tian could not determine its level.


Cultivation techniques were divided into four levels: Heaven, Earth, Profound, and Yellow. Each level was further subdivided into lower, middle, upper, and supreme grades.


Yellow-grade lower techniques were the most common; almost all cultivators could obtain them. Each increase in grade significantly enhanced their effectiveness.


Profound-grade techniques were rarer, each with unique abilities and highly valuable. The Flying Cloud Sect had relied on a supreme Profound-grade technique to survive.


Earth-grade techniques were even rarer and more precious. The appearance of each Earth-grade technique could cause a bloodbath across the Tianyuan Continent.


Heaven-grade techniques existed only in legend; no one had ever seen them, just like Luo Tian’s five-attribute constitution.


“Could the Book of Eons contain a Heaven-grade technique, as legendary as it is?” Luo Tian thought. He then laughed at himself for being too naive; Heaven-grade techniques were not as easily obtained as cabbage.


“Regardless of its level, this is a cultivation technique for five-attribute cultivators. It seems I will rely on it in the future!” Luo Tian sat cross-legged, following the cultivation route in his mind and began practicing the Five Elements Primordial Transformation Art. Soon, primordial energy gathered around him at an alarming speed and entered his body.


The first cultivation stage was the Body Refinement Realm, which had ten levels. By absorbing the primordial energy one could sense, it refined the body to enhance speed and physical strength, increasing its capacity for primordial energy.


After Body Refinement came the Bone Transformation Realm. In this realm, one compressed the primordial energy into essence and imprinted it onto bones, giving them special abilities. After entering Bone Transformation, the stages were divided into early, middle, and late periods, with a peak stage.


The Spirit Realm was the next major challenge in cultivation. Luo Tian knew that the head of the Flying Cloud Sect was a Spirit Realm powerhouse; he had only heard one phrase about the Spirit Realm: “Below Spirit, all are ants!”


After completing a cycle of cultivation, Luo Tian opened his eyes, and two beams of light flashed.


“Such terrifying techniques! Although I don’t know its level, at this cultivation speed, it won’t be long before I reach Level Three Body Refinement!” Luo Tian was excited, wishing he could continue cultivating.


However, the Daan Forest was too dangerous for cultivation. Luo Tian had to suppress his desire and quickly head towards the forest’s exit.


“Even with the Five Elements Primordial Transformation Art, my cultivation speed will greatly increase. But I can’t catch up to Li Xiuping’s Level Seven Body Refinement in the short term. I need time to grow; before I truly become powerful, I must find a place to settle.” Luo Tian silently calculated and decided to head for the nearby city of Tianyuan.


Tianyuan City was the largest within the Flying Cloud Sect’s territory, a place teeming with all kinds of people. It was perfect for hiding. Most importantly, Li Xiuping’s family was in Tianyuan City; Luo Tian did not mind collecting some interest from the Li family first.


Entering Tianyuan City, Luo Tian was considering where to go when he heard commotion ahead.
