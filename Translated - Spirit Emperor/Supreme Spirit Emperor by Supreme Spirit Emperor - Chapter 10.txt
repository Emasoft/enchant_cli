Lo Tiantian had just entered the city when he was subjected to a thorough inspection. Fortunately, there were no traces of yuanqi fluctuations on his person; otherwise, he might have been discovered even before entering the city, let alone attending the auction.

He walked to a secluded corner and changed out of his farmer’s clothes, donning a set of black attire and a large hat.

Today was the day of the Xuantian Auction. Lo Tiantian mingled with the crowd, paying five yuanstones to enter the auction hall.

He sighed at the darkness of the auction. Just the entry fee required five yuanstones, which were a common currency on Tianyuan Continent and could sustain a farming family for an entire year. Fortunately, he had seized the storage bags of Zhang Qi and the Dai Family elder, so five yuanstones were not a concern.

Although the entry fee was unusually high, the auction hall was packed with people. Holding his ticket, Lo Tiantian found his seat and frowned at the noisy crowd. He disliked being surrounded by so many people, as it made him more vulnerable.

If he were to reveal his identity now, Lo Tiantian knew that even with wings, he would not be able to escape Xuantian City.

“Ah... This auction is truly unprecedented! Several young lords from other cities are here. Look, isn’t that the Young Lord of Wentiang City? I didn’t expect him to come! And there’s also the Young Lord of Bai Di City...” A burly man whispered to his companion.

“Cut it out, you know nothing. Do you really think they came for the auction? I believe they are just passing by, haven’t you forgotten that it’s half a month until the Wuxing Sect’s recruitment day?”

“Oh, right! Ah... Only geniuses like them can enter the Wuxing Sect.”

Lo Tiantian extended his consciousness, listening to the murmurs around him. Following their gaze, he saw several young men sitting elegantly in front, with snacks on the table and maidservants attending to them. They exuded an air of arrogance.

Just as Lo Tiantian was looking around, a domineering voice echoed: “Cough... I am Lo Xuantian, the City Lord of Xuantian City. Welcome to our annual auction. I hope you all find what you need. Without further ado, let me announce the start of today’s auction!”

Lo Tiantian felt a chill in his heart. He knew he was no match for Lo Xuantian and his breathing quickened.

As Lo Xiantian’s loud voice resounded, a seductive woman walked onto the auction stage.

“Hello everyone, I am Man Qing, the auctioneer for today. Our first item is a weapon of Yellow Rank Lower Tier.”

Man Qing’s voice was pleasant, and her appearance charming, earning whistles from the audience. However, people only whistled out of habit; in Xuantian City, it was well-known that Man Qing was off-limits to anyone who dared to show interest in her.

Lo Tiantian felt a spark of admiration for Man Qing, but compared to Gu Qianshu, she was not even in the same league.

Soon, several people pushed a box onto the stage. Man Qing swayed her body as she approached the box, causing some people to become excited.

Man Qing announced: “Our first item is a weapon of Yellow Rank Lower Tier!”

Lo Tiantian was shocked by the quality of the auction. While it was common for the first item to be a decent one, an actual weapon of Yellow Rank Lower Tier as the first item was rare.

This was only the second time in his life that Lo Tiantian had seen a weapon of Yellow Rank. The first was Li Xiuping’s longsword.

The crowd watched the covered box with great interest, many eager to bid. Man Qing gently lifted the cloth, revealing a longsword that shimmered with cold light.

“This Yellow Rank Lower Tier Longsword was found by the City Lord in an ancient site. The starting price is 50,000 yuanstones. Bidding begins now!”

“60,000!” A thin man shouted immediately after Man Qing.

“Hmph, with that little yuanstone, you dare bid on a Yellow Rank Lower Tier Longsword? 100,000!” The Young Lord of Wentiang City declared with arrogance.

The thin man turned red but had no choice; he was outmatched in both wealth and status. He could only hold back his anger.

Lo Tiantian was astonished by the high price of a Yellow Rank Lower Tier Longsword. It was just the beginning, and with Zhang Qi’s and Dai Family elder’s yuanstones combined with Gu Qianshu’s and Gu Lei’s, he had about 300,000 yuanstones. He silently prayed that the price of Taiyin Xisui Cao would not exceed 300,000.

As Lo Tiantian was lost in thought, the Yellow Rank Lower Tier Longsword was finally sold to the Young Lord of Wentiang City for 300,000 yuanstones. His face was not pleasant, as 300,000 yuanstones was no small sum.

Time passed slowly. Lo Tiantian carefully sat, not daring to bid on anything that caught his interest, unsure of the price for Taiyin Xisui Cao.

When he saw a Queti Dan go for 10,000 yuanstones, his heart eased. He still had many Queti Dans in his storage bag.

“The next item is a medicinal herb called Taiyin Xisui Cao, which can cleanse the meridians and marrow. It is like a divine elixir for those in the Body Refinement Realm!” Man Qing announced.

The hall fell silent. Few understood Taiyin Xisui Cao’s effects, but the Young Lords’ breathing became uneven. Their main purpose was to obtain a Divine Rank cultivation technique, and the second was Taiyin Xisui Cao.

Lo Tiantian’s expression changed. He knew it was not easy to secure Taiyin Xisui Cao.

“Hmph! Even if I can’t bid, I will steal or snatch it. I cannot watch Gu Lei die!” Lo Tiantian clenched his fist, determined to do whatever it took for Gu Lei.

“Those who understand the value of Taiyin Xisui Cao know its effects. Starting price is 100,000 yuanstones; bidding begins!”

“130,000!” The Young Lord of Bai Di City bid.

“150,000!” The Young Master of Chihuocheng also joined in.

“180,000... 200,000...” Lo Tiantian shook his head at the rising prices.

When it reached 250,000, bidding paused briefly. Lo Tiantian took a pill and coughed hoarsely: “300,000!”

“300,000!” Lo Tiantian’s hoarse voice echoed. He had taken a pill to alter his voice, now sounding like an elderly man.

“Who is this?” The crowd turned their attention to Lo Tiantian, seated in an ordinary spot.

“Hmph! 350,000!” The Young Lord of Wentiang City bid again, his face grim. He had already spent much on the sword and knew securing a Divine Rank technique was unlikely, so he aimed for Taiyin Xisui Cao.

“400,000!” Lo Tiantian’s voice was old but firm.

“My friend, please give me the face and let it go. I, Wentiang City, will befriend you for 410,000!” The Young Lord of Wentiang City said coldly, his aura of Body Refinement Seventh Stage intimidating Lo Tiantian.

“You, Wentiang City? You are not worthy to bid against me!” Lo Tiantian sneered.

A formidable aura surged, dwarfing the Young Lord’s.

“Bone Refinement Realm!” The arrogant youth trembled.

Lo Xuantian, who had been relaxed in the back, sensed the aura and rushed to the stage. He heard Lo Tiantian’s powerful voice.

Lo Tiantian now exuded an aura of Bone Refinement Realm. Last night, he had activated the Epochal Book to gain a skill that mimicked an aura one rank higher.

Lo Tiantian and Gu Qianshu had planned this. He took a voice-altering pill, mimicked the Bone Refinement Realm aura, and left Xuantian City grandly. Otherwise, even if he secured the herb, leaving would be troublesome.

“Bone Refinement Realm! Senior...” The Young Lord of Wentiang City, Zhang Hongyun, was trembling.

“Damn it, Bone Refinement Realm! I just showed off in front of a Bone Refinement Realm cultivator?” Zhang Hongyun cursed his own recklessness.

“How dare you challenge me?” Lo Tiantian’s voice was icy.

“Junior, junior dares not! Junior will bid for Taiyin Xisui Cao and present it to Senior. Please don’t be offended!” Zhang Hongyun was drenched in sweat, hoping the senior’s anger would subside.

Lo Xuantian was also tense. A Bone Refinement Realm cultivator in his city without him knowing was terrifying.

“Junior Lo Xuantian, invites Senior to my residence for a chat!”

Lo Tiantian sneered. “Go to your city lord’s mansion? I must be mad!”

“I am just passing by, heard about the auction. Senior needs this herb for a pill. I will leave now!” Lo Tiantian said calmly, revealing his status as an Alchemist.

The crowd gasped. This old man was not only a Bone Refinement Realm cultivator but also an Alchemist!

Alchemists were like bees in Tianyuan Continent. Minor sects dared not offend a Fourth Rank Alchemist.

A story told of a Fourth Rank Body Refinement Realm Alchemist who was beaten and humiliated by a minor sect. The next day, the sect was attacked and destroyed by Bone Refinement Realm cultivators.

This old man was not only a Bone Refinement Realm cultivator but also an Alchemist, likely at least Fourth Rank.

Zhang Hongyun was terrified and grateful the senior seemed easygoing. Otherwise, not only himself but his family and Wentiang City would be at risk.

“Quickly, send the herb to Senior!” Lo Xuantian was also nervous. He ordered his servants to deliver Taiyin Xisui Cao.

Lo Tiantian took the herb, saying coolly: “Today I am in a good mood. Next time I pass by Xuantian City, I will visit!”

Lo Xuantian was relieved. A Bone Refinement Realm cultivator and Alchemist would be a great ally for Xuantian City. He bowed: “Junior will prepare a grand reception next time!”

Lo Tiantian sneered, “Old dog, I wonder how you will feel when you see me next. You might wish to eat me!”

“Junior’s Wentiang City is always open for Senior!” Zhang Hongyun invited.

“White Di City... Chihuocheng...” Several voices echoed. The Young Lords bowed, inviting Lo Tiantian to their cities.

Lo Tiantian waved: “If convenient, I will visit. But I have a batch of pills to refine now. Also, give me an exit permit; otherwise, if I hurt your men, it will be troublesome. Why do you search so thoroughly?”

“Yes!” Lo Xuantian handed him a permit.

Lo Tiantian left the auction hall, dashing out of the city. The pressure lifted, and the hall resumed its noise.

Zhang Hongyun wiped his sweat, vowing to be less arrogant. He was lucky the senior was easygoing; otherwise, he would not know how he died.

Gu Qianshu stood in the farmer’s home, worried about Gu Lei and Lo Tiantian. She believed Lo Tiantian could succeed, as he had done the impossible before.

Lo Tiantian rushed back to the farm. Gu Qianshu, relieved, had been watching for his return.

Lo Tiantian smiled: “Mission accomplished!”

Gu Qianshu was overjoyed. She had expected him to return safely, but he had actually secured Taiyin Xisui Cao.

“However, we need to wait a day. Although I have the herb, refining Xisui Pills is not easy. They are Second Rank pills and difficult to refine.”

After a night’s rest, Lo Tiantian and Gu Qianshu stood in the farmer’s yard. The couple had gone to work, leaving them with Gu Lei.

They found enough herbs for two Xisui Pills. They decided to each refine one, and if either succeeded, it would be enough.

Gu Qianshu stood by the cauldron, her face serious. She threw herbs into the fire, turning them into pure medicinal liquid.

Soon, all but Taiyin Xisui Cao had turned to liquid. Gu Qianshu’s forehead was beaded with sweat.

The first challenge in refining Xisui Pills was extracting Taiyin Xisui Cao, a cold herb requiring strong consciousness to control the fire. If not done carefully, the batch would fail.

Lo Tiantian watched Gu Qianshu’s skilled movements. He nodded in admiration; the Gu Family was indeed a renowned Alchemy family.

Gu Qianshu adjusted her breathing, threw half of Taiyin Xisui Cao into the cauldron, and carefully refined it with her consciousness.

An hour passed. Gu Qianshu’s face was pale, and she was drenched in sweat. Her slender figure was visible to Lo Tiantian.

Lo Tiantian, however, focused on the cauldron, praying for her success.
