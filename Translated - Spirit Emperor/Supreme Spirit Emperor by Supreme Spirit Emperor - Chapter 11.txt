Ancient Qianxue bitterly smiled in her heart, but when she saw that only a small section remained unrefined, she clenched her teeth tightly and the hand on the fire outlet began to tremble.

“Refine it for me!” Finally, Ancient Qianxue shouted out loud as the last section of the Taiyin Xisui Grass was successfully refined.

Ancient Qianxue panted heavily, a bitter expression on her face. Although the first step of refining the liquid had been completed, the next step was condensing the pill, which was also the final and second most difficult stage. Many ordinary pills often failed at this step.

Luo Tian’s brows furrowed slightly because he knew that condensing the pill would consume even more spiritual awareness, and given Ancient Qianxue’s current state, he could not help but feel worried.

Ancient Qianxue carefully combined the two liquids together. After another hour, when she persisted in infusing the last drop of Taiyin Xisui Grass liquid into the mixture, a loud explosion sound echoed.

Staring blankly at the shattered cauldron, Ancient Qianxue knew she had failed. Her spiritual awareness was far too lacking; combining those dozen drops of liquid together was already her limit.

Luo Tian sighed softly and walked to Ancient Qianxue’s side, “It’s alright, I’m here!”

“Please help me,” Ancient Qianxue looked at Luo Tian seriously. If Luo Tian failed again, then Gao Lei would have no way out, a result she dared not imagine.

Luo Tian said nothing more and took the cauldron out, slapping his palm on the fire outlet. A pale purple flame surged out as one herb after another was infused into the cauldron.

Ancient Qianxue watched Luo Tian’s technique, a hint of disappointment in her eyes. Although his method was not wrong, it was clear that Luo Tian had little experience in refining pills. Thinking this, Ancient Qianxue felt an urge to stop Luo Tian and try again herself, but remembering his determined gaze, she sighed softly and stood quietly.

Although Luo Tian’s technique was somewhat awkward, he was not a complete novice in pill-making. Although it took him longer than usual, he eventually refined the liquid. The Taiyin Xisui Grass was difficult to refine, but Luo Tian managed it with his powerful spiritual awareness.

Luo Tian’s forehead gradually broke out in a sweat, but compared to Ancient Qianxue’s previous expression, he looked much better, giving her a glimmer of hope.

Luo Tian focused his mind and began the step that Ancient Qianxue had failed at—condensing the pill!

“An hour, two hours…” A black mass of liquid floated in the cauldron, clearly the result of combining several liquids. Beside it was a greenish liquid that seemed out of place.

Ancient Qianxue knew this was the critical moment and clenched her white fists, silently praying.

Luo Tian’s eyes revealed a look of madness as he shouted, “Condense it for me!”

His spiritual awareness controlled the two liquids to collide fiercely. As soon as they collided, Luo Tian felt a powerful repulsive force that caught him off guard.

A weak feeling formed in his mind, and his eyes were now bloodshot, his face pale. Clearly, he had overexerted his spiritual awareness.

“Boom…” The cauldron emitted continuous rumbling sounds.

“Crack…” After enduring prolonged strain, the cauldron finally began to crack, on the verge of shattering.

Luo Tian knew that if the cauldron shattered, all their efforts would be wasted, just like Ancient Qianxue’s.

Luo Tian bit his tongue hard to stay清醒, a trace of blood flowing from the corner of his mouth.

“I can’t let Gao Lei die! Condense it for me, condense!” Luo Tian shouted madly as a fragrant aroma spread out.

Ancient Qianxue clenched her fists tightly, eyes fixed on the cauldron in front of Luo Tian, silently praying.

“Crack…” The cauldron finally shattered, and at that moment, several black pills shot out.

Luo Tian moved quickly, taking out a jade bottle and swiftly collecting the pills.

Hearing the explosion sound, Ancient Qianxue felt her heart shatter. But when she saw the black pills fly out, her eyes filled with excitement.

Chapter 24: Detoxification

Unable to contain her joy, Ancient Qianxue tightly hugged Luo Tian and shouted, “Success! Success! Haha!”

However, Luo Tian only smelled a fragrant scent and felt a warm body rubbing against his chest.

Both drenched in sweat, they were pressed together so tightly that it felt as if they weren’t wearing anything. Luo Tian realized he could clearly see what Ancient Qianxue was wearing underneath, making him feel parched.

After a moment of joy, Ancient Qianxue calmed down and realized she was pressed against Luo Tian. Seeing his flushed face, she shouted and ran away with a red face.

Watching Ancient Qianxue’s retreating figure, Luo Tian felt an unusual sensation rise in his heart. He knew this feeling; it had appeared when he was with Chen Yunting.

Thinking of Chen Yunting, Luo Tian’s gaze became distant as he murmured softly, “I wonder how you’re doing. Hmph, half a year later, I’ll wait for you on Feiyun Mountain and tell you that your decision was wrong!”

Luo Tian gathered his scattered thoughts and walked towards the room.

…

In the evening, Gao Lei, who had been unconscious for two days, looked as if he had lost a circle of weight. Thin black qi could be clearly seen spreading from his chest.

Luo Tian and Ancient Qianxue stood by the bed, watching the unconscious Gao Lei. Neither of them looked at each other, and an awkward atmosphere filled the air.

Luo Tian broke the silence first, “Let’s help him detoxify!”

“Hmm,” Ancient Qianxue softly acknowledged and then fell silent, making Luo Tian feel awkward.

Luo Tian reached out to take the jade bottle and pry open Gao Lei’s mouth, feeding him the pill.

As soon as the pill entered his mouth, a chill rose from Gao Lei’s body. Luo Tian shivered involuntarily and stared intently at Gao Lei, fearing any unexpected developments. After all, he had never taken a Xisui Pill himself.

Ancient Qianxue also anxiously watched her younger brother, the flush on her face long gone. She seemed to have returned to her usual spirited self.

After the chill rose, Gao Lei softly sighed in relief. Clearly, he had been severely tormented by the poison for two days. The black qi in his meridians gradually faded, visibly converging towards his chest.

Finally, after a quarter of an hour, all the black qi gathered at his chest and slowly moved upwards to his throat.

“Gag…” Gao Lei opened his mouth wide, forcefully vomiting out a mouthful of black, foul-smelling blood.

Luo Tian quickly pulled Ancient Qianxue behind him to prevent the black blood from splashing on her.

Caught off guard by Luo Tian’s cold pull, Ancient Qianxue felt a manly scent and looked at his back. She recalled the time in Tianyuan City when Luo Tian had saved her multiple times with his not-so-wide back.

Seeing Gao Lei’s condition improve明显, Luo Tian couldn’t help but relax. However, Gao Lei did not wake up; he continued to lie there with his eyes closed, which puzzled Luo Tian.

Ancient Qianxue was also puzzled. Why hadn’t Gao Lei woken up even after the poison had been expelled? Her slightly relaxed heart tightened again.

Seeing Ancient Qianxue’s worried look, Luo Tian reached out to feel Gao Lei’s pulse. Then he smiled softly, “Don’t worry, he’s fine. This kid is trying to use the Xisui Pill’s power to advance to the fourth level of Body Refinement!”

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Ancient Qianxue finally relaxed. She turned around to clean up Gao Lei’s vomit and then bid Luo Tian farewell, heading towards her room.

“Haha!” The next morning, a long laugh broke the tranquility of the small village.

The early-rising rural couple was startled out of their courtyard by this long laugh. Just outside the yard, they saw a shocking sight: the young man who had been half-dead yesterday was now lively and broke a tree in front of his door in two.

“How? Fourth level Body Refinement already, and you start showing off?” A light female voice sounded. Ancient Qianxue appeared in front of Gao Lei, her jade hand pulling his ear hard.

“Ahhh… Sister! Sister!” Gao Lei wailed, unable to speak.

Luo Tian also walked out of the courtyard and looked at Gao Lei and Ancient Qianxue with a smile.

Seeing Luo Tian come out, Ancient Qianxue gently let go of her hand and couldn’t help but recall the intimate scene from yesterday, her face flushing again.

Gao Lei stared in disbelief at his sister and rubbed his eyes to make sure he wasn’t mistaken, “Sister! You actually blush?”

“Get lost…” Ancient Qianxue snapped back to her senses and pulled Gao Lei’s ear again, causing him to wail in pain.

After breakfast, the three of them gave a Qi Stone to the couple and left amidst their continuous gratitude.

It wasn’t that Luo Tian didn’t want to give more, but he was afraid too much wealth would bring them misfortune.

The three walked on the road to Wuxing Sect, glancing back at Xuantian City with cold eyes. Clearly, they would not let this go but were currently too weak to act.

Wuxing Sect was located on Wuxing Mountain. It was said that the first generation leader of Wuxing Sect had astonishing cultivation, unifying the northern part of Tianyuan Continent by himself and standing on equal footing with other dominant sects, never falling behind.

Wuxing Sect recruited disciples regardless of their background; as long as they had talent, they could join. This complexity made Wuxing Sect the largest sect in Tianyuan Continent.

The first day of the third month was the recruitment day for Wuxing Sect. Even as an outer sect disciple, one could walk tall in the major cities of the north. Of course, Wuxing Sect had strict rules and would not allow disciples to act recklessly in the secular world.

At this time, carriages came and went on Wuxing Mountain, forming a continuous stream. Groups of carriages were parked at the foot of Wuxing Mountain.

The most eye-catching were several luxurious carriages with well-trained guards, each carrying young men with arrogant expressions.

Zhang Qi was particularly excited today because he would finally become a disciple of Wuxing Sect. Although his cultivation wasn’t impressive, he had an uncle who was an inner sect disciple on Jinguang Peak. Through various connections, Zhang Qi had finally been pulled into Wuxing Sect.

Luo Tian, Ancient Qianxue, and Gao Lei looked at the dense crowd in amazement. Although they had some preparation, they were still surprised by how popular the recruitment was.

Following the crowd to the foot of Wuxing Mountain, Luo Tian saw several sons of city lords at the front and couldn’t help but smile.

Just a few days ago, he had pretended to be in the Bone Dissolution realm and tricked them. He wondered what they would think if they knew he was merely a Level 5 Body Refinement cultivator.

Chapter 25: Heavenly Ladder

At noon, an elder stood at the wide gate of Feiyun Sect and shouted loudly, “Everyone, I am Kong Deming, an outer sect elder of Wuxing Sect. Today is our recruitment day!”

First, I will introduce the basic requirements for recruitment: those below Level 3 Body Refinement and over twenty years old can leave directly!”

Kong Deming stood there, looking like a frail old man. However, no one dared to underestimate him because he carried the aura of Bone Dissolution realm.

Seeing Kong Deming, Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed. He sighed at the power of Wuxing Sect; even an outer sect elder was in Bone Dissolution realm, far surpassing the Feiyun Sect he had once belonged to.

Hearing Kong Deming’s words, only a few people left. After all, Wuxing Sect recruited disciples every year with the same rules.

“Alright, now please participate in the first test!” Seeing most people leave, Kong Deming pointed to a towering ladder beside him. “This ladder is called the Heavenly Ladder! Those who reach 200 steps can enter the outer sect selection, those who reach 400 steps can enter the inner sect selection. Those who reach 800 steps will be personally taken as disciples by peak elders, and those who reach over 900 steps will likely be personally taken as disciples by peak leaders! Alright, young people, go ahead. Whether you can enter Wuxing Sect depends on your own efforts!”

After hearing Kong Deming’s words, people rushed towards the towering Heavenly Ladder.

Zhang Qi blended into the crowd, looking around. Many women were also participating in the test. He was not worried about being eliminated; he had prepared well and was confident of reaching 200 steps.

As Zhang Qi commented on the beauty or ugliness of the female disciples, he suddenly noticed Luo Tian and Ancient Qianxue in the crowd.

Seeing Luo Tian, Zhang Qi’s body trembled involuntarily. His legs had nearly been crippled last time, but his father spent a lot of money to get a pill that healed him and helped him reach Level 3 Body Refinement. Otherwise, he wouldn’t even have a chance to enter Wuxing Sect.

But Zhang Qi soon sneered, “Hmph! Kid, didn’t expect you to be here too. Although I can’t do anything about you, my uncle is an inner sect disciple. I don’t believe a mere Level 5 Body Refinement can beat him!”

Luo Tian, blending into the crowd and extending his spiritual awareness, also noticed Zhang Qi. A flash of killing intent appeared in his eyes but he didn’t tell Gao Lei, knowing that the impulsive youth might rush over and kill Zhang Qi. After all, Gao Lei had nearly died in Xuantian City.

Soon, a crowd arrived at the towering Heavenly Ladder. Although it could accommodate thousands of people, it didn’t feel crowded.

People rushed towards the steps, and Luo Tian followed suit. He climbed with Ancient Qianxue and Gao Lei. As soon as he stepped on the ladder, he felt immense pressure, both physically and spiritually.

The first ten steps were not too difficult. Most people here were at Level 3 Body Refinement, and even those at Level 2 could reach the first hundred steps.

Luo Tian followed everyone to the 100th step, his brows furrowed. The Heavenly Ladder felt strange to him, but he couldn’t pinpoint why.

As people advanced towards the 200th step, some weaker Level 3 Body Refinement cultivators began to struggle and either retreated or sat on the steps, unable to rise.

If they stayed too long, disciples in Wuxing Sect attire would come and carry them off the ladder.

Zhang Hongyun, the young lord of Wenti City, moved quickly and reached the 200th step without a drop of sweat. He looked up confidently, his goal being over 800 steps.

Zhang Hongyun glanced at a few potential threats and stepped up firmly.

When he reached the 200th step, Luo Tian noticed that Zhang Qi, who should have been a weakling, was still there. This puzzled him.

Suppressing the pressure, Luo Tian extended his spiritual awareness towards Zhang Qi and found a faint blue light emanating from his chest.

“Yellow-grade defensive equipment?” Luo Tian guessed that Zhang Qi must be wearing a Yellow-grade defensive item. Otherwise, he would never have reached the 200th step.

Even with a Yellow-grade defensive item, Zhang Qi was under immense pressure. His legs trembled as he struggled to reach the 200th step, finally collapsing on the steps and panting heavily.

Luo Tian sneered. Although his spiritual awareness was under pressure, he could still release it and focus a beam of spiritual awareness to strike Zhang Qi.

“Ahhh…” Zhang Qi felt intense pain in his head and involuntarily leaned back. Already sitting, he rolled backward down the ladder like a ball.

Kong Deming sensed cold killing intent behind him and saw a cold light flash in Zhang Daoyi’s eyes. Following his gaze, he just caught the scene of Zhang Qi rolling down the steps.

“Is that your cousin?” Kong Deming asked softly.

Zhang Daoyi answered without hesitation, “Yes, the useless cousin I mentioned to you.”

“Oh, then let’s consider him passed this first test. As for the next tests, handle it yourself,” Kong Deming said indifferently.

Hearing this, Zhang Daoyi was overjoyed. Clearly, Kong Deming had tacitly approved Zhang Qi’s favoritism.
