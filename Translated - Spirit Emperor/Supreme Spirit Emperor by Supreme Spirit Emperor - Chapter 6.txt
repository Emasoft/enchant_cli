Watching the argument escalate into a heated quarrel, and then into factional strife, Gǔ Yún furrowed his brows in frustration. He then slammed the table and said, “Stop arguing! I hope you all understand one thing: our Gǔ family’s current standing is not due to compromise. Therefore, I will wait three more days; if there's no solution by then, I shall take the Exploding Body Pill to break through the formation and fight the Lǐ family to the death!”

Seeing Gǔ Yún make his decision, all members of the Gǔ family fell silent, knowing there was no turning back. They began preparing for the inevitable confrontation.

Three days passed swiftly. Some of the weaker disciples in the Gǔ family felt a growing weakness, clearly sensing that their family’s essence energy had dwindled to less than one-tenth of its former level.

Standing in the courtyard, Gǔ Yún had his family behind him. After three days of fruitless attempts to break the formation, Gǔ Yún held a brown pill in his hand, determined. Just as he was about to place the pill into his mouth, a roar of a tiger sounded, causing Gǔ Yún to pause.

“A trace of the power of a fierce tiger!” Gǔ Yún looked towards Lu Tiān’s courtyard, his face filled with shock. Others also turned their heads.

“Father, what is the power of a fierce tiger?” Gǔ Lèi asked in confusion.

“Do you think I gave Lu Tiān the Dragon-Tiger Body Refining Pill? Although I am confident in my ability to refine such a pill, adding a trace of true dragon and fierce tiger power is something I could never achieve. You must understand, even the lowest level true dragons and tigers are among the most formidable beasts; I am far from their caliber.”

Gǔ Yún sighed, marveling at the cultivation level of the senior who entrusted him with delivering the pill to Lu Tiān, estimating that this person had already reached the Profound Dao realm.

“What difference does it make if there is a trace of true dragon and tiger power in the Dragon-Tiger Body Refining Pill?” Gǔ Lèi continued to ask.

“Difference? It is immense! Ordinary Dragon-Tiger Body Refining Pills, though potent, are manageable. But with these two drops of essence blood added, the effect would be ten times stronger than a regular pill. In other words, not everyone could survive taking it; you would likely die within one breath if given to you!”

Hearing Gǔ Yún’s explanation, Gǔ Lèi shuddered in relief that he had lost to Lu Tiān. He could not imagine the consequences otherwise.

Gǔ Yún also did not expect that the Dragon-Tiger Body Refining Pill contained a trace of true dragon and tiger power. If he had known, he would not have allowed Lu Tiān to take it so soon. He was even more surprised that Lu Tiān could withstand such powerful medicine.

Gǔ Yún’s words were not exaggerated; without the Book of Eons, Lu Tiān would have died long ago.

Although Lu Tiān endured the medicine with the help of the Book of Eons, he could not refine it in a short time.

Faced with no other choice, Lu Tiān forcibly compressed most of the medicinal power into various parts of his body, waiting for a future opportunity to refine it.

As he practiced the Five Elements Transforming Essence Technique, Lu Tiān began absorbing essence energy from within the Gǔ family. Unbeknownst to him, the Gǔ family’s essence energy was already scarce due to the formation. His frantic absorption left no trace of it within their domain.

Feeling the depletion of essence energy, some elders who had initially supported handing Lu Tiān over to the Lǐ family could no longer hold their tongues, urging Gǔ Yún to make a decision. However, Gǔ Yún silenced them all.

Gǔ Yún did not rush to take the pill but instead told everyone to be patient. He knew that if Lu Tiān successfully refined the dragon and tiger power, his strength would increase unimaginably, possibly surpassing Gǔ Yún’s.

Then, Gǔ Yún would no longer fear Lǐ Fēihóng.

After his absorption, Lu Tiān also felt the scarcity of essence energy but had no choice. With breakthrough imminent, he could not afford to miss this opportunity.

Finally, after absorbing the remaining essence energy of the Gǔ family, Lu Tiān’s dantian felt like a bottle filled to capacity with one last drop of water, creating an explosive force that collided against the dantian barrier.

Lu Tiān gritted his teeth, enduring the pain in his meridians. He roared, “Body Refining Fourth Stage! Break through, break through!”

Chapter Twelve: The Five Elements Cycle Seal

With the sounds of dragon and tiger roars, Lu Tiān’s meridians expanded several times, his essence energy becoming much more abundant.

“It's done!” Lu Tiān was elated. He swung his arm, feeling incomparably stronger than before. If he were to fight Lǐ Yuándé now, his dragon-refined body alone would easily defeat him.

Reaching the Body Refining Fourth Stage, Lu Tiān’s spiritual awareness also increased significantly, expanding to several hundred meters. He decided to once again use his spiritual awareness to contact the Book of Eons, curious about any changes.

“Boom!” His spiritual awareness surged like waves towards the Book of Eons. As it did, the book slowly opened its third page under Lu Tiān’s expectant gaze.

Unlike before, this time it felt as if he had entered another world. He quickly saw a figure standing atop a mountain, hands constantly changing as a giant seal formed in their hand. The figure gently pushed it forward, and the seal disappeared from its hands only to reappear on another mountain peak, crashing down with great force.

“Boom…”

An astonishing scene unfolded. Before the seal even touched the mountain, it shattered into pieces. The seal then fell further, as if aiming to pierce through the earth, creating a dark hole.

“Five Elements Cycle Seal!” The words appeared in Lu Tiān’s mind, followed by countless images.

Gǔ Yún watched as Lu Tiān remained in meditation. He stood before him, personally guarding his safety.

Seeing their family head personally protecting the young man, some discontented members of the Gǔ family frowned but dared not speak out due to Gǔ Yún’s authority.

Not long after, Lu Tiān opened his eyes. Waves of energy emanated from his hands as a golden seal formed, clearly displaying ancient patterns with an air of antiquity.

“What martial technique is this? Just the waves make my heart tremble! It feels almost impossible to resist!” The Third Elder, filled with fear, took several steps back before steadying himself.

Lu Tiān’s eyes lit up in joy. He had not expected success on his first try. He glanced at the formation barrier above and pushed both hands upward with force.

“Boom!”

The seal vanished instantly, followed by a powerful collision sound that made everyone’s ears buzz.

“Snap!”

A crisp sound echoed as the formation barrier visibly cracked open. The Gǔ family members showed expressions of joy, sensing essence energy flowing into their domain through the cracks. They believed it would completely shatter within a quarter of an hour.

“Good lad!” Gǔ Yún laughed, patting Lu Tiān on the shoulder with a look of satisfaction. These days had not been as easy for Gǔ Yún as it appeared; he had endured family pressure to protect Lu Tiān. Fortunately, Lu Tiān did not disappoint him.

Gǔ Qiánxuě looked at Lu Tiān with a complex expression, curious about his mysterious martial technique and wondering what his true identity was.

Feeling the long-lost essence energy, some elders who had wanted to hand Lu Tiān over to the Lǐ family felt ashamed. With his demonstrated strength, even Gǔ Yún might not be a match for him. Such a genius in such a short time would be cherished by any family.

Before Lu Tiān could catch his breath, Gǔ Yún led him to the council hall. Gǔ Yún recounted the Lǐ family’s visit.

Seated, Lu Tiān listened to Gǔ Yún and his face darkened. “Lǐ family, it’s time for a visit!”

...

In Tiānyuán City, the Lǐ, Gǔ, and Wáng families had long dominated. They lived in peace for a long time, but today the city was unusually quiet. The bustling city had every door closed.

People noticed that members of the Gǔ family, who hadn’t been seen for a long time, had come out en masse. Leading them was Gǔ Yún, the family head, followed by Gǔ Qiánxuě and some elders. Everyone knew something significant was about to happen.

As the Gǔ family headed towards the Lǐ family, in the Lǐ family’s ancestral hall, Lǐ Fēihóng was closing his eyes and striving to break through.

LǏ Fēihóng’s face showed no emotion, but his aura fluctuated. Soon, a crisp sound came from his body as formidable energy surrounded him, growing stronger.

Moments later, Lǐ Fēihóng opened his eyes with intense joy. He laughed heartily, “Hmph! Body Refining Sixth Stage! Today is the day for your Gǔ family’s destruction!”

At that moment, Gǔ Yún and others had already arrived at the Lǐ family’s gate. They shouted loudly, “LǏ Fēihóng! Come out!”

The Gǔ family members, who had been trapped in the Lǐ family’s formation for some time, were憋ing with anger. They roared, forming a surging battle intent that rose to the heavens.

The Lǐ family’s guards, seeing such an imposing array, were terrified and fled inside.

LǏ Xiuran was in high spirits. With the entire Gǔ family, including that troublemaker Lu Tiān, trapped inside, he no longer had to worry about encountering him. His father would soon emerge from seclusion and destroy the Gǔ family, ensuring Lu Tiān’s demise. He might even capture Gǔ Qiánxuě for his own pleasure.

Seeing the usual sycophantic guard rush to him, LǏ Xiuran frowned. “What’s wrong? Calm down! Didn’t I teach you to remain composed in emergencies?”

“Master, the Gǔ family is here!” The guard panted, rushing to LǏ Xiuran.

“Rubbish! How could the Gǔ family escape from our formation? Chen’er, if you spread more rumors, I’ll break your legs!” LǏ Xiuran slapped the guard and gave him a look of disbelief.

“Master! It’s true!” The guard hurriedly explained.

“Boom!” Before Chen’er could finish, a muffled sound echoed.

“Hmph! Who dares to come and cause trouble at my Lǐ family? Let’s go see!” LǏ Xiuran patted Chen’er on the shoulder, showing his authority.

“LǏ Fēihóng! If you don’t come out now, I’ll tear your Lǐ family apart!” Gǔ Yún’s loud voice echoed throughout the LǏ family.

LǏ Xiuran, who had been acting arrogantly, stumbled upon hearing Gǔ Yún’s voice. He nearly fell but was caught by Chen’er.

“Damn it, they really came!” LǏ Xiuran cursed and rushed towards the ancestral hall.

Arriving at the ancestral hall, he shouted, “Father! Something’s wrong!”

Just having broken through and in a good mood, LǏ Fēihóng heard his son’s shouting. He was furious and slapped him, scolding, “How did I teach you to remain calm? If you had interrupted me during my breakthrough, I would have gone mad!”

LǏ Xiuran knew he was too hasty and muttered to himself, “Truly my father; you speak the same way!”

LǏ Fēihóng snorted and walked towards the gate.

Seeing LǏ Fēihóng emerge, both families turned their attention to him.

LǏ Fēihóng looked at Gǔ Yún and snorted, “Gǔ Yún, I didn’t expect you to come here yourself. Since you’re here, there’s no need for you to leave!”

Chapter Thirteen: The Destruction of the Lǐ Family

As tensions between the Gǔ and LǏ families reached a breaking point, a gentle voice suddenly rang out, “What’s so lively today?”

“Hmph, I didn’t expect you to even bring the Wáng family. Gǔ Yún, is this your support? Wáng Péngtiān, are you also going to get involved in this mess?” Hearing the voice, LǏ Fēihóng’s expression darkened.

“LǏ Fēihóng, I know your situation well. If the Gǔ family loses today, it will be our Wáng family next!” Wáng Péngtiān, dressed in scholar’s robes, slowly walked to Gǔ Yún.

“Since you’re here, then let’s settle both of your families today!” LǏ Fēihóng nodded indifferently, his aura surging as he reached the Body Refining Sixth Stage. His formidable presence pressed down on Gǔ Yún and Wáng Péngtiān.

“Body Refining Sixth Stage! I didn’t expect you to actually break through!” Gǔ Yún and Wáng Péngtiān’s faces darkened as they looked at the Body Refining Sixth Stage LǏ Fēihóng.

“Hmph! Gǔ Yún, it’s too late to regret now!” With the other two of their generation firmly under his control, LǏ Fēihóng was in high spirits.

Turning to Lu Tiān, he said, “Boy, you are Lu Tiān? Indeed, you have some strength. No wonder you dared to come and cause trouble at our LǏ family! After I deal with these two old men, I will make you wish for death but unable to die!”

Without hesitation, LǏ Fēihóng charged at Gǔ Yún and Wáng Péngtiān, clearly not taking Lu Tiān seriously.

Seeing LǏ Fēihóng charge at them, Gǔ Yún and Wáng Péngtiān’s faces turned grim. They knew today would be troublesome.

Gǔ Yún took a pill and swallowed it, his aura surging as he reached the Body Refining Sixth Stage.

Wáng Péngtiān also bit his finger, letting a drop of blood fall onto the talisman. After absorbing the essence blood, the talisman seemed to come alive, revealing a golden ape.

Wáng Péngtiān did not throw the talisman but pressed it against his chest. Soon, the ape’s shadow merged with Wáng Péngtiān, and his aura surged to reach the Body Refining Sixth Stage.

“Kill!” Both of them charged at LǏ Fēihóng with their newfound power.

“Kill!” Seeing their family head charge first, the disciples of both families roared and joined in.

Gǔ Qiánxuě activated the Great Blazing Sun Palm, charging at a Lǐ family elder of Body Refining Fourth Stage. Gǔ Lèi also roared, charging at LǏ Xiuran.

“Exploding Body Pill, Golden Armor Talisman!” Seeing their fierce determination, LǏ Fēihóng sneered.

“Do you really think these can match me? Today, let’s see the difference between entering Body Refining Sixth Stage through external means and true Body Refining Sixth Stage!”

LǏ Fēihóng attacked fiercely, engaging in a battle with the two.

Lu Tiān watched as the three fought. Seeing Gǔ Yún and Wáng Péngtiān use special methods to reach the Body Refining Sixth Stage but still unable to defeat LǏ Fēihóng, he knew that the outcome would depend on these three.

With this in mind, Lu Tiān took an Exploding Body Pill. As the medicine entered his body, he felt a strong medicinal power flow into his dantian and roared, charging at LǏ Fēihóng.

With Lu Tiān’s addition, the three managed to temporarily suppress LǏ Fēihóng. However, they felt no relief but rather a heavy burden. They knew their current state was due to special methods, and once the effects wore off, they would be at LǏ Fēihóng’s mercy.

LǏ Fēihóng was well aware of this and only defended passively, causing a stalemate.

“This can’t continue! I’ll have to try that move; it’s the only chance!” Lu Tiān shouted at Gǔ Yún and Wáng Péngtiān, “Please hold on a bit longer!”

Without waiting for their response, Lu Tiān leaped outside and began forming waves of energy with his hands.

He channeled the Five Elements essence energy to its peak, gathering it in his hands. A terrifying pressure emanated from the forming seal.

Under this pressure, some low-level disciples of both families stopped and looked at Lu Tiān’s forming seal with fear.

Lu Tiān was drenched in sweat, feeling his essence energy drained. Although he had reached the Body Refining Fourth Stage and expected more abundant energy, he underestimated the Five Elements Cycle Seal. Even though it had worked before in the Gǔ family, this time he used the enhanced version, which was incredibly draining.

“Haha! Boy, you’re powerless and drained!” Seeing Lu Tiān’s state, LǏ Fēihóng laughed. Though the seal made him tremble, he could also sense Lu Tiān’s dwindling essence energy, unable to sustain the seal.

Lu Tiān’s eyes were bloodshot with intense regret. He knew he might be drained to nothing.

Just as Lu Tiān was about to give up, the Book of Eons opened a crack on its final page, and a crimson essence energy seeped out.
