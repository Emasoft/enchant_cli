Standing at the seven hundredth level to break through? Gu Qianxue’s ability to breakthrough at the six-hundredth level was already a miracle; the seven hundredth level? If Luo Tian succeeded, he would be too extraordinary.

Luo Tian also felt that the primordial energy here was somewhat insufficient, and he guessed it might be due to excessive pressure. However, at this moment, there was no turning back.

“‘For now, let’s not worry about it too much. We must try anyway. I hope for success!’”

Luo Tian sighed lightly and continued to absorb the primordial energy.

“‘Wait! Look at his primordial energy vortex!’” Finally, some meticulous people saw a scene that shocked them.

“‘Whoosh!’” The sound of someone sucking in air could be heard, and Kong Deming was no exception. His eyes revealed an expression of disbelief.

“‘Five! Five colors!’” People rubbed their eyes in disbelief. They knew what the five colors represented and were all shocked as they watched Luo Tian, who kept breaking their limits.

“‘Wu Xing Body!’” The peak masters in the courtyard at the back of Wu Xing Sect were also filled with shock.

“‘This time, none of you are allowed to compete with me!’” An old man stood up excitedly, his eyes red as he turned and roared.

However, when he turned back, he found the area behind him empty, with no one there.

“‘Damn it!’” The old man stomped his foot, causing the surrounding houses to shake a few times. Then, a pair of huge purple-black wings spread open on his back as he disappeared from the spot, leaving behind a gust of wind.

At this moment, Luo Tian did not feel very well because the surrounding primordial energy was far from sufficient for him to break through to the sixth level of Body Refinement. A look of disappointment appeared in his eyes.

“‘It’s always been you helping me, now it’s my turn!’” Gu Qianxue's gentle voice sounded beside Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s body trembled as he felt a warm palm pressing against his back. Threads of fire and wood attribute primordial energy entered his body from Luo Tian’s back.

Luo Tian turned his head to look at Gu Qianxue, a look of gratitude on his face. Although primordial energy could be cultivated back, Gu Qianxue had just entered the fifth level of Body Refinement and her cultivation was not stable. If this continued, she might fall back to the fourth level of Body Refinement.

“‘Stop it! It’s useless!’” Luo Tian said, looking at Gu Qianxue who was continuously inputting primordial energy into him.

“‘No!’” Gu Qianxue simply said one word lightly, her eyes showing determination with no intention of stopping.

“‘Stubborn girl!’” Luo Tian smiled bitterly.

“Well, today I won’t believe it. Even if it’s just the sixth level of Body Refinement, I will break through!” Luo Tian’s eyes hardened as he no longer hesitated and began to integrate the primordial energy Gu Qianxue was sending over.

Time passed second by second, and Gu Qianxue’s face became increasingly pale. Her internal primordial energy was nearly exhausted, and she could fall back to the fourth level of Body Refinement at any moment.

“‘I must help him! Even if it means falling back to the fourth level of Body Refinement, so what!’” Gu Qianxue’s face was pale as she held a “Burst Body Pill” in her hand.

“‘Girl! Let go of your hand, leave the rest to us!’” Just as Gu Qianxue was about to take a desperate gamble and swallow the Burst Body Pill, a woman’s voice sounded.

Gu Qianxue’s body trembled slightly as a powerful wood attribute primordial energy entered her body, nourishing her already exhausted meridians.

“‘Hey? Why are there people with wings in the sky?’” Someone in the crowd murmured.

Kong Deming looked up, his eyes widening with surprise. He then bowed deeply along with the many disciples behind him: “Jin Guang Peak, Outer Sect Elder Kong Deming, paying respects to the peak masters!”

As Kong Deming’s voice faded, people all looked up at those flying in the sky, their eyes filled with infinite respect.

“‘Primordial Spirit Realm!’” In Tian Yuan Continent, these people could act freely. One Primordial Spirit Realm cultivator could support a second-rate sect like Flying Cloud Sect, which relied on its Primordial Spirit Realm master.

Today, they had seen five great cultivators of the Primordial Spirit Realm. People couldn’t help but sigh at Wu Xing Body’s talent, as even the peak masters of each peak had personally come out, clearly wanting to recruit Luo Tian into their peaks.

The five people in the sky pointed remotely, and primordial energy of five colors shot out from their fingers like five long dragons, flying towards Luo Tian’s body.

Luo Tian, who had already decided to give up, received this great gift. His eyes focused as he shouted lowly: “Sixth level of Body Refinement! Open!”

As Luo Tian’s shout echoed, a surging aura formed around him, making his robe flutter dramatically as if he were the only person standing between heaven and earth.

Gu Qianxue stood in front of Luo Tian, as if the pressure from the Heavenly Ladder had vanished. She felt a sense of relief.

Kong Deming’s disciple Zhang Daoyi looked grim, never expecting that the ordinary disciple in his eyes would suddenly become a legendary Wu Xing Body. The peak masters of each peak were actively helping him break through to the sixth level of Body Refinement.

“‘You are too despicable!’” A voice filled with anger sounded, accompanied by the sound of something breaking through the air. A pair of purple-black wings appeared in the sky instantly.

“‘Hehe, Wu Pingan, you blame others for your own slow speed!’” An old man mocked.

“‘Hmph, Old Si Tu, it seems you are about to have diarrhea again!’” Wu Pingan replied with a teasing look in his eyes.

“‘Alright, stop arguing. We are all here for this young man. Now we should discuss which peak he will be under!’” Seeing the two about to argue again, the woman intervened, shifting the topic back to Luo Tian.

“‘Hmph! He will be under my Li Huo Peak. My Eight Desolate Fire Dragon Technique finally has a successor! Ha ha!’” The peak master of Li Huo Peak, Si Tu Anle, laughed loudly.

“‘What’s so great? He would be more suitable under Jin Guang Peak. My Qing Mu Peak is even better! Tian Du Peak is the best!’” The few people quickly started arguing like children, completely ignoring the thousands of people below who were stunned.

“‘Are these the peak masters of Wu Xing Sect? They act like street ruffians!’” People were particularly surprised, not expecting the peak masters to value Wu Xing Body so much that they were almost ready to fight.

Luo Tian watched the several Primordial Spirit Realm cultivators vying for him and wondered if they would storm the Pill Pavilion if they knew he was already a disciple there.

Chapter 29: Wu Xing Sect Master

“‘You are disrupting the order! Where is your peak master’s dignity? You all act like ruffians, arguing in front of so many people!’” A stern voice sounded as a green-robed old man flew over from afar.

Hearing the stern voice, the arguing peak masters all stopped and looked at the green-robed old man who had appeared in front of them with some respect.

“‘Pay respects to the master!’” They all bowed slightly.

“‘What? Did I hear that right! The master of Wu Xing Sect? Not only did I see the peak masters of each peak, but also the master of Wu Xing Sect! My heavens! I must tell my father about this so he stops bragging about meeting the master of Chi Huo Sect!’”

A young man standing at the two-hundredth level on the Heavenly Ladder exclaimed.

Kong Deming was also deeply shocked. He had only seen the master a few times, and never expected that a Wu Xing Body would even move the master.

Kong Deming did not dare to speak, having no right to do so. He knelt with Zhang Daoyi and the many disciples behind him, waiting for Wei Mingxuan, the stern ruler of the Northern Region, to speak.

Luo Tian watched as the scene grew larger and felt increasingly troubled. Looking at the several Primordial Spirit Realm cultivators in the sky, he silently prayed that his mysterious master, the Pill Pavilion master, was among them. Otherwise, he did not know how to handle this situation today.

“‘Hmph! With your mediocre abilities, what kind of disciples can you produce?’” Wei Mingxuan’s voice followed.

Hearing Wei Mingxuan, a sense of unease came to the minds of several peak masters.

“‘Old man, I have never taken a disciple in my life. Today, none of you should compete with me. I plan to take this young man as my sole disciple!’” Wei Mingxuan’s face remained calm, his words spoken with indifference.

“‘Shameless! Truly shameless. Every time it’s the same, you look down on them, and when you slightly favor one, that old thing snatches him away!’” Several peak masters thought the same words.

Seeing the righteous Wu Xing Sect master, several peak masters’ faces twitched. He was indeed telling the truth and speaking in front of so many people. If they defied their master’s face, it would inevitably affect Wu Xing Sect’s reputation.

“‘Wu Xing Sect Master’s sole disciple!’” Wei Mingxuan’s voice was clear, and everyone below heard it clearly.

Everyone looked at Luo Tian with envy. Being a disciple of the Wu Xing Sect master could make him act freely in the Northern Region, and with just a word, he could destroy some minor sects. Moreover, being the sole disciple meant Luo Tian might be the next Wu Xing Sect master!

Luo Tian’s heart was pounding. If not for his mysterious master, he would have been overjoyed and jumping with happiness at this moment. But now, he could not feel any joy.

“‘He is so outstanding wherever he goes! Whether in Tian Yuan City or the much stronger Wu Xing Sect!’” Gu Qianxue secretly rejoiced for Luo Tian.

“‘Did you see? He is my brother!’” Gu Lei shouted to the side.

“‘Hmph! If he’s your brother, I’ll call you father!’” A young man beside him looked at Gu Lei as if he were a fool and mocked.

“‘Are you serious?’” Gu Lei became interested and approached the person who had mocked him.

“‘Hmph! Lazy to deal with you, a lunatic!’” The young man ignored Gu Lei and rolled his eyes.

“‘Hmph! Just wait, he will come to find me later!’” Gu Lei’s face turned red, clearly provoked. However, he was met with more rolling eyes.

Zhang Hongyun looked at Luo Tian somewhat unwillingly. All attention was on Luo Tian, and no one noticed that he had reached the eight-hundred-fiftieth level. Today, he should have been the most outstanding figure, but now all attention had shifted to Luo Tian.

Feng Qianyu did not care and continued walking up the steps as if he saw only the Heavenly Ladder.

The third young man in black clothes looked at Luo Tian, his eyes showing a mysterious expression. A slight smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.

With so many people focusing on him, Luo Tian’s face flushed. Although he did not feel any pressure from the several Primordial Spirit Realm cultivators in the sky, they were still beings who could blow him away with a single breath.

“‘What is your name?’” Wei Mingxuan asked seriously. To take Luo Tian as a disciple, his identity must be clear. Not only should he ask, but someone would also need to verify it soon.

“‘Junior Luo Tian, currently residing in the Gu family of Tian Yuan City,’” Luo Tian answered quickly while bowing.

“‘Oh, are you willing to become my disciple?’” Wei Mingxuan continued, already treating Luo Tian as his disciple. His eyes showed a hint of warmth.

“‘This... Junior... Actually...’” Luo Tian stammered, unsure how to respond.

“‘Men should speak their minds. Don’t be so hesitant!’” Wei Mingxuan’s face showed some displeasure, clearly dissatisfied with Luo Tian’s hesitation.

“‘Master, this young man has already joined our Pill Pavilion!’” A clear voice sounded, coming from someone who seemed quite young.

As the voice faded, a man in his thirties walked over with a robust youth and another young man in black clothes. They arrived at the base of the Heavenly Ladder and shouted towards the sky.

“‘Who is this? Daring to speak to the master like that? Don’t you value your life?’” Questions arose from the crowd.

But after the questions, people saw a scene they would never forget. The young man leading them emitted a primordial energy fluctuation, and two huge wings slowly spread open. He gently flapped them and rose into the air towards Wei Mingxuan and the peak masters.

“‘Heavens! This young man is also in the Primordial Spirit Realm! Such a young Primordial Spirit Realm cultivator!’” People exclaimed, their heads spinning in disbelief at the day’s events.

“‘Zhang Ziping!’” Wei Mingxuan muttered, secretly troubled. He never expected the Pill Pavilion to find out.

The peak masters of other peaks saw Zhang Ziping’s arrival and smirked, but then felt a bit smug.

Luo Tian saw the newcomers with a hint of joy. He recognized Zhang Ziping’s two followers as Lei Yong and Ji Chen from Tian Yuan City, and he felt relieved that the next steps were no longer his concern.

Zhang Daoyi clenched his teeth, disappointed that Luo Tian had suddenly become a sought-after figure, forcing him to pause his plans.

“‘Pill Pavilion master’s lineage!’” In Wu Xing Sect, it was a special existence. Currently, there were only three disciples under the master, but they held great prestige within Wu Xing Sect.

The first disciple, Zhang Ziping, had a three-attribute body and was thirty-one years old. He was in the Primordial Spirit Realm, a talent so extraordinary that even without his master at the Pill Pavilion, Zhang Ziping’s presence ensured the Pill Pavilion's status in Wu Xing Sect.

The second disciple, Lei Yong, had a lightning attribute body and was the first in Wu Xing Sect’s Bone Refinement Realm. The third disciple, Ji Chen, had a dark attribute body and often ranked first or second in the Bone Refinement Realm disciples.

These three disciples of the Pill Pavilion were each more extraordinary than the last. Today, the Pill Pavilion planned to recruit Luo Tian as their fourth disciple, indicating his terrifying talent.

Zhang Qi, with a bruised face, watched Luo Tian and quietly retreated. He knew he had to inform his father about today’s events; Luo Tian was no longer someone a small Xuan Tian City could provoke.

Chapter 30: The Blossoming of the Heavenly Talent

“‘Ziping, did your master send you?’” Wei Mingxuan asked the young man he had once wanted as a disciple.

“‘Yes, my master discovered Luo Tian during his travels in Tian Yuan City and took him as a disciple!’” Zhang Ziping said respectfully to Wei Mingxuan.

Wei Mingxuan frowned slightly, seemingly deep in thought. However, the peak master of Jin Guang Peak sneered: “‘That old man from the Pill Pavilion hasn’t been seen for years. How can you be sure he took Luo Tian as a disciple?’”

Zhang Ziping smiled but said nothing. A scroll appeared in his hand, which he slowly opened.

As the scroll unfolded, golden light spilled out. An old figure appeared before everyone, looking ethereal and dignified despite his white hair and lack of wrinkles.

“‘Peak Master Wei, this young man is already my disciple. It’s not that I’m competing with you; he is related to an important matter! Please give me some face, and I promise not to compete with you in the future!’” The old man’s voice faded as his figure disappeared.

Wei Mingxuan watched with respect as the old man spoke and waved: “‘After the assessment is complete, Luo Tian will be a disciple of the Pill Pavilion.’”

With Wei Mingxuan’s decision, the peak masters had nothing more to say. They were slightly dissatisfied with the Pill Pavilion’s domineering ways but, remembering the terrifying strength of the Pill Pavilion master in the past, left reluctantly.

Luo Tian was also deeply moved by the young-looking Primordial Spirit Realm cultivator. He never expected such a young Primordial Spirit Realm cultivator, who seemed to be his senior apprentice brother.

“‘Good! Since your master is not at the Pill Pavilion, after you complete the assessment, go to the Pill Pavilion. I will answer your questions then!’” Zhang Ziping said with a warm look, then turned and left.

“‘Little junior brother, we will watch over you!’” Lei Yong’s loud voice echoed as he and Ji Chen remained below, shouting loudly. People nearby were displeased but tolerated Lei Yong’s Bone Refinement Realm cultivation.

As the Primordial Spirit Realm cultivators left, those below sighed in relief. Today’s events were too overwhelming.

Even the peak masters were somewhat amazed that someone could refuse to be the sole disciple of Wu Xing Sect’s master and choose another peak, even a mysterious Pill Pavilion, which they considered less attractive.

After their initial shock, people turned to the young man who had caused such a stir. He seemed unaffected and slowly lifted his leg, continuing to climb.

People then noticed others still on the Heavenly Ladder. They were left speechless.

Zhang Hongyun looked bitter, deeply affected by today’s events. Luo Tian had attracted everyone's attention, and when people looked back at the Heavenly Ladder, Zhang Hongyun had fallen from first to third.

Indeed, Zhang Hongyun was now in third place. Feng Qianyu had overtaken him at some point, and the young man in black clothes slowly passed him as well. This was hard for Zhang Hongyun to accept.
