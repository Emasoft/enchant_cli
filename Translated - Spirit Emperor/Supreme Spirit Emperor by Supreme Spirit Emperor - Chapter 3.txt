Observing Luo Tian holding the Dragon-Tiger Body Refinement Pill, Gǔ Léi suddenly felt aggrieved. A few days ago, he had pestered his father, Gǔ Yún, but failed to obtain even one Dragon-Tiger Body Refinement Pill.

Now, Gǔ Yún had actually taken the initiative to give this Dragon-Tiger Body Refinement Pill to Luo Tian, which filled Gǔ Léi with jealousy.

“Father! Why give it to him!” With a flushed face, Gǔ Léi looked at Gǔ Yún with great reluctance.

“Rebellious child, what I do is none of your business. Get out!” Seeing his son dare to question him, Gǔ Yún lost his temper.

Seeing that his father was truly angry, Gǔ Léi dared not provoke further and left the hall with a lowered head. Before leaving, he shot a jealous glance at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian, who had stayed in the Flying Cloud Sect, naturally knew how precious the Dragon-Tiger Body Refinement Pill was. He did not know what to do for a moment. The Dragon-Tiger Body Refinement Pill was too tempting for Luo Tian, who longed to improve his cultivation. However, accepting such a valuable gift without reason made him feel somewhat inappropriate.

“You also go out. Do not think too much about it!” Seeing Luo Tian’s hesitation, Gǔ Yún smiled at him and gestured for him not to worry too much.

Hearing Gǔ Yún’s words, Luo Tian no longer acted coy and directly placed the jade bottle in his bosom. In his heart, he secretly resolved to repay Gǔ Yún’s kindness when the opportunity arose.

After Luo Tian and others left, only Gǔ Yún and Gǔ Qiānxuě remained in the reception hall.

Gǔ Qiānxuě secretly glanced at Gǔ Yún and试探性地问道：“Father, who is he? Could it be that he really is your illegitimate son as rumored outside? These years, Mother…”

“Pfft…” Hearing Gǔ Qiānxuě’s words, Gǔ Yún spat out the tea in his mouth and interrupted her, gritting his teeth and saying, “Li Yuande, if I ever see you again, I will definitely break your mouth!”

Gǔ Yún cursed and then explained to his beloved daughter. After explaining for a long time, he finally convinced Gǔ Qiānxuě that Luo Tian was not his illegitimate son.

Seeing Gǔ Qiānxuě leave with a hint of interest, Gǔ Yún chuckled and said, “I really hope he is my illegitimate son!”

Gǔ Qiānxuě almost stumbled and fell when she heard her father’s words as soon as she stepped out of the hall.

Luo Tian and Tán Bó arrived at the residence arranged by Gǔ Yún. It was a small courtyard with lush bamboo, creating a serene environment.

From the arrangement of this residence, it was clear that Gǔ Yún valued Luo Tian greatly. This made Luo Tian even more curious, not understanding why Gǔ Yún treated him so well.

When Luo Tian entered the courtyard, he discovered a plump figure standing at the door of the house.

“Gǔ Léi!” Luo Tian could not help but think of Gǔ Yún’s son, a passionate young man, whom he had seen in the reception hall today.

Luo Tian did not know what this young man was up to, but recalling the look he had given him when leaving earlier, Luo Tian knew it would not be anything good.

“Boy! Dare you bet with me once? If I win, you will give me the Dragon-Tiger Body Refinement Pill!” Gǔ Léi stated his intention directly.

“Sorry, not interested!” Hearing Gǔ Léi’s words, Luo Tian felt displeased but, considering that Gǔ Léi was Gǔ Yún’s son, he politely replied.

“You! What a cowardly fellow. I wonder what my father sees in you to appoint you as the chief guest? Don’t you want to hear about my bet?” Gǔ Léi sneered at Luo Tian.

“Oh? Then tell me, what are we betting on? What is your bet?” Luo Tian’s temper was finally roused. If Gǔ Léi did not show some sense, he would give him a lesson, even though he was Gǔ Yún’s son. He should not be allowed to look down on him.

“A Yellow Rank martial technique!” Gǔ Léi looked at Luo Tian confidently, believing that Luo Tian would not be able to resist. After all, martial techniques were rare treasures, and from Luo Tian’s appearance, he did not seem to have access to such things.

Originally somewhat indifferent to the bet, Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed when he heard Gǔ Léi. Having stayed in the second-rate Flying Cloud Sect, Luo Tian knew how precious martial techniques were. In the sect, he had only ever dreamed of obtaining one.

“Alright! I agree to your bet. However, let’s do it a month later. As for what we are betting on, you decide!” Luo Tian spoke calmly.

Seeing Luo Tian agree, Gǔ Léi’s eyes lit up with joy. He thought to himself, “Only a month! There is no way he can come up with any tricks!”

“Alright! A month later, when you hear the bell, go to the training ground. You will know what we are competing in then!” After saying this, Gǔ Léi took large steps out of Luo Tian’s courtyard.

“Alright, let it be. If I am here, I will make the best of it!” Seeing Gǔ Léi’s retreating figure, Luo Tian shook his head helplessly and turned to enter the house.

Thus, Luo Tian settled down in the Gǔ family. He spent almost all his time cultivating, and a month passed by in the blink of an eye.

One evening, Luo Tian sat on his bed and thought to himself: “Li Xiuping needs half a year for seclusion, so he will not pose any threat to me in that time. What I need to do is reach the same level as Li Xiuping within half a year, or else when he emerges from seclusion, I will be in big trouble.”

The Li family must hate me to the core now. However, because of the Gǔ family’s influence, they dare not move against me for the time being. I can focus on cultivation. As the head of the Gǔ family, Gǔ Yún is at the Fifth Stage of Body Refinement. The head of the Li family should not be much different. I must reach the Fifth Stage of Body Refinement to have any chance against them.

With a clear goal in mind, Luo Tian became even more eager for power. He reached into his storage bag and took out two jade bottles, one containing the Dragon-Tiger Body Refinement Pill given by Gǔ Yún and the other a bottle of First Rank cultivation pills, Body Refinement Pills.

Chapter 6: Soul-Calling Bell

The Dragon-Tiger Body Refinement Pill was too potent for Luo Tian to handle at his current stage, so he chose the Body Refinement Pill as a secondary option.

Luo Tian put the Dragon-Tiger Body Refinement Pill back into his storage bag, planning to use it when he reached the Fourth Stage of Body Refinement. He then took a Body Refinement Pill in his hand and said softly, “After nearly a month of cultivation, my essence energy is almost complete. I hope this Body Refinement Pill can help me advance to the next stage. With my constitution, once I reach the Third Stage of Body Refinement, even if I encounter Li Yuande again, I will not be as helpless as last time. And my chances of winning the bet with Gǔ Léi will also increase.”

Luo Tian had set the date for the bet a month later because he was confident that he could reach the Third Stage of Body Refinement within that time. Only after reaching the Third Stage would he have a chance to win the bet.

The pill entered his mouth, and pure essence energy flowed down his throat into his dantian. Luo Tian began to circulate the Five Elements Essence Transformation Art, converting the medicinal power of the pill.

Not long after, Luo Tian opened his eyes and put another pill in his mouth. “The effect is only this much? It seems that the amount of essence energy needed to advance my constitution is significantly more than for ordinary constitutions.”

Luo Tian continued, stuffing four more Body Refinement Pills into his mouth. The five-colored essence energy in his meridians finally reached a critical point, and Luo Tian’s face turned slightly flushed as beads of sweat trickled down his cheeks.

A wave after wave of energy surged out from Luo Tian’s body, causing the teacups on the table to tremble. Inside his body, a series of crisp sounds began.

These sounds grew increasingly dense until they sounded like popping beans.

Moments later, Luo Tian suddenly opened his eyes and growled, “Third Stage of Body Refinement, open!”

In an instant, Luo Tian’s aura reached its peak. A tremendous suction force emerged from his body, drawing the surrounding essence energy into him.

The essence energy in the courtyard even showed a brief shortage before returning to normal after three breaths.

Luo Tian clenched his fists and clearly felt that he was several times stronger than when at the Second Stage of Body Refinement. A sense of confidence welled up within him: “Li Yuande, next time we meet, I will not be as helpless as last time!”

The night passed in the blink of an eye. The sky began to brighten, but Luo Tian did not feel any fatigue. He sat cross-legged on the bed and continued to consolidate his cultivation.

A heavy bell rang, jolting Luo Tian out of his meditative state.

The sound seemed to penetrate his soul and was imprinted in his mind. It came from the Gǔ family’s treasure, the Soul-Calling Bell.

Luo Tian had heard about this treasure during his month in the Gǔ family. Recalling what Gǔ Léi had mentioned about the bell, Luo Tian could easily guess what kind of competition awaited him.

Smiling at the sound of the bell, Luo Tian thought, “Boy, I will teach you a lesson first. That Yellow Rank martial technique is mine!”

Luo Tian tidied up and followed the sound of the bell to the training ground.

At the Gǔ family’s training ground, a huge ancient bell hung in the center, exuding an aura of antiquity. The patterns on its surface had become somewhat flattened over time, indicating its great age.

Surrounding the bell were many young members of the Gǔ family, including Gǔ Léi. At that moment, Gǔ Léi was using his spiritual sense to strike the bell.

“Brother Gǔ Léi is so powerful! Not only has he reached the Third Stage of Body Refinement, but his spiritual sense is also so strong. It’s only been a month, and he has already returned!” A Gǔ family disciple looked at Gǔ Léi with admiration.

“Yes, the last time he struck it four times. I bet this time it will be at least five!” Another disciple watched Gǔ Léi with excitement.

The Soul-Calling Bell was a treasure of the Gǔ family. It did not require a bell striker but could be struck with spiritual sense. The more times it was struck, the stronger one’s spiritual sense was proven to be. Its other function was to enhance spiritual sense, making it a truly formidable ability.

Since setting the bet with Luo Tian, Gǔ Léi had been continuously strengthening his spiritual sense. Last month he struck it four times, and after a month of cultivation, his spiritual sense had increased. He was confident he could strike it five times.

Gǔ Léi focused his spiritual sense and struck the bell with all his might...

“Clang...” The sound of the bell echoed, making people’s ears itch.

Gǔ Léi showed a look of arrogance and glanced down at Luo Tian, who had just arrived. He then struck the bell again with his spiritual sense.

“Fifth strike!” The Gǔ family disciples cheered. Some who knew about the bet between Gǔ Léi and Luo Tian looked at Luo Tian with mockery.

However, Luo Tian merely watched Gǔ Léi standing arrogantly beside the bell without any change in his expression.

Seeing Luo Tian’s calm demeanor, Gǔ Léi’s eyes filled with madness. He gritted his teeth and strained to focus the last bit of his spiritual sense, growling, “Sixth strike!”

“Clang...” The sound of the bell echoed again, causing a stir among the Gǔ family disciples. No one had been able to strike it more than five times since Gǔ Qiānxuě struck it seven times two years ago, but Gǔ Léi had just done so.

Gǔ Léi looked at Luo Tian and said smugly, “Brother Luo, it seems your Dragon-Tiger Body Refinement Pill will have a new owner!”

“It’s still too early to say!” Luo Tian said calmly, walking beside the bell and slowly focusing his spiritual sense. He tentatively struck it.

The sound of the bell echoed, and Luo Tian felt a slight headache.

“So that’s why it is not about striking the bell with spiritual sense but whether one can withstand the counterforce!” Understanding this, Luo Tian’s lips curled.

“Hmph, that Yellow Rank martial technique is mine!”

“Clang clang...”

Two more sounds of the bell echoed, causing the Gǔ family members to gasp in shock. They began to take Luo Tian seriously and noticed he looked quite calm, clearly still having some strength left.

After striking the bell three times, Luo Tian felt a bit. “Hmm, good thing my spiritual sense has been strengthened by the Epochal Book; otherwise, I might have stopped here. But now...”

“Clang, clang...” The fourth and fifth strikes echoed again. Not only those in the audience but even Gǔ Léi, who had come to see Luo Tian fail, was stunned. He looked at Luo Tian as if he were a monster.

“Is this guy a monster?” Gǔ Léi’s mouth hung open in disbelief. The confident Gǔ Léi, who had thought he was sure to win, now felt a bit uneasy.

Gǔ Léi knew how powerful the counterforce of the Soul-Calling Bell was. If struck continuously, the counterforce would be several times stronger than a single strike. Normal people would stop and rest after each strike, but Luo Tian had struck it five times in a row without stopping to catch his breath.

“Clang...” The sixth strike echoed.

Gǔ Léi’s heart tightened. He knew he would not only lose the Dragon-Tiger Body Refinement Pill but also likely the Yellow Rank martial technique. He could only pray that Luo Tian would not strike it a seventh time.

Luo Tian also felt somewhat strained. Although his spiritual sea had been strengthened by the Epochal Book, continuously enduring the counterforce made his head throb.

However, Luo Tian believed he still had some strength left.

“Brother Gǔ, it seems you are going to lose!” Luo Tian smiled and struck the bell a seventh time.

The sound echoed, and the Gǔ family disciples fell silent. This tied the record set by the prodigy of the Gǔ family, Gǔ Qiānxuě.

No one dared to look down on Luo Tian anymore. An untrained person could now rival the prodigy of the Gǔ family, who relied on spiritual sense. Could you believe it?

“Since I have already shone, to avoid others causing trouble, let me shine even more!” Luo Tian focused his remaining spiritual sense and struck the bell with all his might.

Chapter 7: Flame Dragon Hand

“Clang...”

The sound was several times stronger than before and echoed throughout the Gǔ family. Gǔ Léi’s face turned pale, looking at Luo Tian with bitterness: “You have won. To surpass my sister’s record is no shame.”

In the depths of the Gǔ family courtyard, some elders praised: “The head’s eyesight is indeed good. This young man is truly extraordinary, with limitless potential in the future!”

Not far from the training ground, Gǔ Qiānxuě’s lips curled slightly: “Eight strikes? Interesting.”

The eighth strike echoed, shaking the entire Gǔ family. The one who caused this was Luo Tian, standing beside the bell with a thoughtful expression.

The counterforce of the Soul-Calling Bell caused Luo Tian’s head to ache, but after the pain passed, a cool sensation followed.

Unable to resist, Luo Tian roared to the sky. A soul-shaking force emanated from him, causing the Gǔ family disciples’ spiritual seas to tremble.

In an instant, Luo Tian felt his spiritual sea expand significantly. He could not help but marvel at why most of the Gǔ family were alchemists; with this Soul-Calling Bell, one’s spiritual sense could not help but become powerful.

Previously, Luo Tian could only extend his spiritual sense to about thirty meters. Now, he could reach over a hundred meters, demonstrating the Soul-Calling Bell’s extraordinary power.

Frowning slightly, Luo Tian suddenly remembered something and bowed to Gǔ Léi before disappearing from sight.

Rushing back to his courtyard, Luo Tian sat cross-legged on the bed. The Epochal Book reacted again: “The first page gave me the Five Elements Essence Transformation Art. What will I get from the second page?”

In the bamboo courtyard, Luo Tian sat cross-legged and continuously used his spiritual sense to touch the Epochal Book.

Soon, his entire spiritual sea turned into a golden ocean. The Epochal Book slowly trembled and, under Luo Tian’s anticipation, slowly opened the second page, revealing the words “Hundred Chapters of Alchemy Herbs.”

Then, countless names of medicinal herbs seemed to crawl into Luo Tian’s mind. Even with his remarkable willpower, he felt a headache.

“It is about alchemy. The Gǔ family is an alchemy clan; it’s a good opportunity to learn something. After all, alchemists are highly valued throughout the Tian Yuan Continent.” Luo Tian muttered to himself and then became completely immersed.

Another month passed slowly. Luo Tian enjoyed this peaceful life, simple yet comfortable. Gǔ Léi also recognized him and often came to spar with him. Although losing a Yellow Rank martial technique to Luo Tian hurt him for a long time, he was always straightforward and did not dwell on it. After all, one must accept the consequences of a bet. Luo Tian gradually liked Gǔ Léi’s straightforward personality.

One day, Luo Tian stood in the Gǔ family martial arts hall, holding a jade slip and carefully examining it. However, his expression grew increasingly grim as he read, eventually breaking into a curse: “Damn it, a fragment! Gǔ Léi, wait until I get out to see how I will deal with you for tricking me!”

A fragment of a martial arts technique was essentially useless. The first part was usually weak, but if one were lucky enough to find the subsequent parts, it would definitely be a powerful technique. However, in the vast Tian Yuan Continent, finding subsequent parts was like searching for a needle in a haystack.

Luo Tian felt very aggrieved at being tricked by Gǔ Léi but had no choice. He currently had no martial arts techniques to learn and could only sigh, “Alright, let’s try practicing it first!”
