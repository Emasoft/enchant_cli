Following the martial arts techniques’ cultivation path, Luo Tian quickly began his practice in the Martial Arts Pavilion.

The Martial Arts Pavilion is specifically designed for the disciples of the Gu Clan to cultivate martial arts, preventing any unintended damage caused by the overwhelming power of martial techniques.

The place where Luo Tian was practicing is akin to a barrier, said to be set up by an array master hired by the Gu Clan, capable of withstanding a single attack from a Xuan-level martial technique.

Time passed swiftly through another night, and Luo Tian continuously channeled his essence energy along the prescribed path of martial techniques. His hands moved ceaselessly, as if they knew no fatigue.

After a night of relentless effort and repeated failures, Luo Tian’s face turned pale from the excessive consumption of essence energy.

At this moment, his hands kept changing positions,显得生涩无比，身体中的火属性元气悄然运转，灼热的感觉在周围形成，一条火龙在洛天的手中缓慢地形成，在洛天一推之下直接向前冲去。 "轰……" 火龙撞到了结界上发出一声轰鸣，爆出大量的火星。 "果然很繁琐，施展的时间也偏长，威力也是一般！" 洛天盘坐在地上，开始恢复起消耗的元气，眼中却露出失望之色。不过洛天很快想起了自己是什么体质，五行体，自己的身体中又有木属性元气，木生火！想到这，洛天擦了擦额头上的汗水，双手又快速地变化起来。不过这一次，洛天悄然调动一丝木属性元充斥到火龙之中。本来不大的火龙，遇见木属性元气之后仿佛火上浇油一般，熊熊燃烧起来。洛天眼露喜色，低吼一声，将炎龙手送出。火龙仿佛要报复刚才结界抵挡住自己一般，凶猛的撞向结界。 "轰……" 震天的响声响起，洛天明显的感觉到结界仿佛颤动了一下，整个结界下面都变成了一片焦土。洛天目瞪口呆地看着炎龙手的战果，一下子兴奋起来：“怪不得都说双属性是天才的范畴，这威力快接近黄级中品了吧！虽然消耗有点大，但也算是一个不错的武技了！”想到这，洛天整理了下衣衫，看着天色已经大亮，洛天大步朝着武技阁外走去。刚出武技阁的大门，洛天就看到几个人迎面走了过来，带头的正是古家的天之娇女古千雪，而旁边则是肥硕的古雷。洛天不知道什么事让古雷如此兴奋，不过洛天本就是不太爱管闲事的人，并不想理会这些人。 "洛天，洛天这里！这里！” 古雷的声音响起，传进洛天的耳朵中。听到古雷喊自己，洛天不得不停下脚步，看着迎面走来的古雷和古千雪。“怎么了？发生了什么事么？”洛天不解疑惑地看着古雷问道。 “还不是李家的那些杂碎，听说咱们古家的一座坊市被李家的人给砸了，分管的弟子也被李家的人给打伤了，我跟我姐正打算带人去看看，你也一起去吧！”古雷冲着洛天解释道。 “额！” 洛天被古雷的话说的一愣，但是想想现在自己毕竟是古家的客卿，好像还没为古家做过什么事，而要对付的更是自己的死敌李家，洛天点了点头站在了古雷的旁边。 古千雪看到洛天站到自己弟弟的旁边，并没有阻止，心中其实也很想看看自己父亲推崇的年轻客卿有什么本事。 几人很快便来到了古家一处卖丹药的坊市，看到几个古家弟子正躺在地上，身上满是淤青，坊市里面则是满目狼藉。看到如此场景，古千雪的眼神冷了下来，古家虽然以前也与李家有些小摩擦，但是从来没将弟子打的如此严重。 古千雪吩咐带来的几个人将伤员救治好，自己则是来到一个伤的比较轻的弟子身前。“李家的人？去哪了？” 古千雪平静的话音响起。 虽然古千雪的声音平静，但是那是因为性格使然，熟知古千雪性格的古雷明白，越是平静的古千雪，就带表着越是愤怒。 那名古家弟子看到来人是古千雪，不禁有些激动，连忙答道：“是李修然，他们朝着城外的方向走了！” “古雷，你带人将伤员救治一下，我去出城看看李家到底在耍什么花样！”古千雪快速地安排了下事情，便朝着城外飞奔而去。看到自己的姐姐朝城外赶去，眼中露出一丝担忧，虽然古千雪是炼体四层木火双属性的天才，但是这次的李家明显是有什么阴谋。 古雷把目光投向了洛天，通过一个月的相处，古雷知道洛天的实力远比自己强大，声音里带着一丝请求的意思：“洛天，你能不能去帮帮我姐！” 洛天一直看着古千雪离开，心中也是暗恼这个古家的天才太过冲动，不过自己毕竟跟人家不熟，不好说什么听到古雷的话，一直对古雷有些好感的洛天点了点头，身形一闪朝着古千雪的方向追去.

Chapter Eight: Great Battle with Li Yuande

Gu Qianxue rushed out of the city and into a forest. As soon as she entered, she felt a sense of danger but, confident in her abilities, she released her divine sense and sneered: “Come out. Don’t hide. I didn’t expect the Li Clan to be so foolish as not to know that people from the Gu Clan have divine sense.”

As soon as her words ended, wind sounds were heard and over ten martial artists at the third level of Body Refinement emerged from the forest, among them a young man in fine clothes was Li Xiuran.

“Unexpectedly, I managed to catch such a beautiful fish. I thought the Gu Clan would only send that foolish Gulei,” Li Yuande licked his lips and looked at Gu Qianxue with greedy eyes.

“Hmph! Li Xiuran, do you really think that these few third-level Body Refinement trash can capture me?” Gu Qianxue said with a look of disgust.

“Hehe, have you forgotten what our Li Clan is best at?” Li Xiuran said with a sinister smile as his guards took their positions.

“Array formations!” Gu Qianxue suddenly realized, but it was too late.

The guards of the Li Clan had already taken their positions and various colors of essence energy shone on their hands, converging towards the center and merging into one.

Seeing this, Gu Qianxue kicked off the ground with her feet and smashed a punch towards one spot.

“Step, step, step!” Gu Qianxue retreated several steps and looked at the array formation surrounding her with a serious expression, muttering: “Xuan Guang Jing Jin Array.”

The Xuan Guang Jing Jin Array is a simple array formation used to trap people, extremely sturdy and hard to break. It’s a second-level array formation of the Li Clan.

Seeing Gu Qianxue trapped in the array, Li Xiuran jumped up and sneered: “Hehe, little beauty, wait for my uncle to arrive. I will definitely let you out then. I don’t believe that even if Gu Qianxue is as powerful as the heavens, she can defeat my uncle and so many third-level Body Refinement martial artists.”

While Gu Qianxue was thinking about how to break the array, she felt a bad premonition when she heard Li Xiuran’s words. If it was true, she had no chance of winning.

Thinking this, Gu Qianxue regretted her overconfidence and made a decision. Her only chance was to break the array and escape, even if it meant she would be somewhat depleted of essence energy. If Li Yuande arrived, things would become truly troublesome.

Gu Qianxue made up her mind and began to move her hands continuously, her aura rising steadily as essence energy flowed towards her hands.

“Martial technique! Great Blazing Sun Palm!” Li Xiuran shivered when he saw the martial technique forming in Gu Qianxue’s hands, but then relaxed a bit when he remembered the array formation.

A red palm appeared in Gu Qianxue’s hand, and with her long hair flying, she roared: “Wood generates fire, Great Blazing Sun Palm!”

The huge palm emitted scorching heat and crashed into the array formation.

“Boom... Crack...” A crisp sound echoed as cracks spread across the array.

Seeing the array broken, Li Xiuran was shocked. He never expected Gu Qianxue to be so powerful that even a second-level array formation couldn’t hold her.

However, when he saw the somewhat weakened Gu Qianxue standing in the center of the array, his face regained its confident smile.

Although Gu Qianxue had broken the array, she was now extremely weak. The martial technique had consumed too much of her essence energy; she felt that it was only at three-tenths of its peak.

“Hehe, Gu Qianxue, although my guards have consumed some essence energy setting up the array, they should still be much stronger than you. Why are you all standing there? Go and capture this girl for me!” Li Xiuran’s saliva almost dripped from his mouth as he imagined Gu Qianxue being defeated.

“Hmph! Who dares?” Although weak, Gu Qianxue exuded a fierce aura that intimidated the guards.

“Whoever can capture her, I’ll let him have another go!” Li Xiuran was furious when he saw the guards didn’t move.

With great rewards, there are brave men. When the guards saw Gu Qianxue’s stunning appearance, they felt a surge of heat in their bellies and rushed towards her.

Gu Qianxue, the dual-attribute genius at the fourth level of Body Refinement, used what little essence energy she had left and actively met the guards’ attacks. The forest was soon filled with various colors of essence energy.

Although Gu Qianxue was formidable, her essence energy was insufficient. Not long after she defeated seven guards, she finally collapsed on the ground from exhaustion.

Seeing Gu Qianxue fall to the ground, Li Xiuran was overjoyed and laughed loudly as he walked towards her.

Li Xiuran felt triumphant. He had been eyeing Gu Qianxue for a long time and couldn’t wait to touch her face.

Seeing Li Xiuran approaching, Gu Qianxue knew what would happen if she fell into his hands.

Gu Qianxue closed her eyes in despair, trying to muster the last bit of strength to end her life. However, her arm felt as heavy as lead and wouldn’t move.

A howl sounded, causing the already despairing Gu Qianxue to open her eyes. A thin figure stood in front of her, while Li Xiuran was spitting blood and flying backward with his arm hanging limply. He lay on the ground, groaning in pain.

“Luo Tian!” Gu Qianxue was delighted to see Luo Tian, but then felt a bit sad.

Luo Tian’s strength was at the third level of Body Refinement. Although these guards had been exhausted from fighting, defeating Luo Tian, who was at the same level as them, would be too simple.

Li Xiuran looked at Luo Tian standing in front of Gu Qianxue with eyes full of fire. He hated Luo Tian, who had repeatedly ruined his plans.

“Kill him for me!” Li Xiuran’s cold voice came from between clenched teeth.

Luo Tian turned to look at Gu Qianxue sitting on the ground and smiled: “Don’t worry, I’ll handle this. You just recover.”

Seeing Luo Tian’s smile, Gu Qianxue felt a bit reassured despite her despair. She took out a recovery pill and swallowed it, closing her eyes to recover.

Luo Tian turned his face, revealing a fierce fighting spirit as he rushed towards one of the guards. His fist, enveloped in golden essence energy, smashed into a guard’s chest.

“Crack...” The guard didn’t react in time and was hit by Luo Tian’s fist, his chest breaking with a sound. His body flew backward.

Seeing he had easily knocked the guard away, Luo Tian’s eyes lit up with joy as he quickly moved towards the remaining guards.

The guards were already exhausted from setting up the array and fighting Gu Qianxue. They had no chance against Luo Tian, who was at the same level as them but with a more formidable defense due to his Five Elements Body.

In no time, Luo Tian had knocked all the guards unconscious.

Seeing Luo Tian’s ferocity, Li Xiuran shuddered. He couldn’t understand how Luo Tian, who had been powerless against his uncle Li Yuande not long ago, could become so powerful.

After dealing with the guards, Luo Tian didn’t relax but shouted: “Old dog, come out if you want to save your nephew!”

“Unexpectedly, this stinky fish can still cause some waves. Your divine sense is strong enough to detect me; I underestimated you!” With these words, Li Yuande slowly emerged from the forest.

Seeing Li Yuande, Luo Tian didn’t show any surprise because he had already discovered him hiding nearby.

Li Yuande thought sending so many people would be enough to handle any situation, but he still worried about his nephew Li Xiuran. As an only childless man, Li Yuande had treated Li Xiping and Li Xiuran as his own sons. Since Li Xiping was always at the Flying Cloud Sect, only Li Xiuran remained by his side. Therefore, Li Yuande’s affection for Li Xiuran surpassed even that of his elder brother, Li Feihong.

Seeing Li Xiuran in trouble, Li Yuande stepped out from the shadows and sneered: “I admit I underestimated you, but today there’s no Gu Yun to save you!”

Seeing Li Yuande’s confident expression, Luo Tian couldn’t help but sneer: “So, without Gu Qianxue’s strength, you think you can defeat me?”

Luo Tian’s eyes filled with fighting spirit as he roared and charged at Li Yuande, slapping out a palm.

Seeing Luo Tian not showing any panic and attacking him instead, Li Yuande’s eyes flashed with coldness. As a fourth-level Body Refinement martial artist, he wouldn’t be afraid of Luo Tian, a mere third-level Body Refinement. He clenched his fist and punched towards Luo Tian.

A loud boom echoed as both of them retreated.

Luo Tian couldn’t help but feel delighted, confirming that he could now match a typical fourth-level Body Refinement martial artist.

With this thought, Luo Tian fought spiritedly with Li Yuande. They exchanged blows evenly, each one matching the other.

“This hateful boy can actually fight me on equal terms despite being of a lower level. If he continues to grow, he will become a great enemy for our Li Clan. I must kill him today!” Determined, Li Yuande began to channel his essence energy, and a golden light appeared on his fist.

“Flowing Cloud Golden Fist!”

Seeing Li Yuande use the martial technique, Luo Tian quickly channeled his essence energy and used the newly learned Dragon Hand of Flame.

This time, Luo Tian didn’t just channel fire essence energy but also added wood, water, metal, and earth essence energies in the order of their generation. This was his method to enhance dual-attribute techniques through the Five Elements Generation, and it was also his trump card for challenging Li Yuande alone.

“Five Elements Generation, Dragon Hand of Flame!” The Five-Element Dragon Hand emerged, causing the sky and earth to change color. The dragon of fire seemed alive, roaring as it soared into the air and charged at Li Yuande.

Feeling the terrifying power of Luo Tian’s martial technique, Li Yuande twitched his eyes and turned to run without hesitation. The power of the martial technique far exceeded his understanding, and he knew he couldn’t withstand such an attack.

Driven by the threat of death, Li Yuande pushed his speed to its limit but still couldn’t match the Dragon Hand’s. Even more terrifying was that the dragon was incredibly agile, locking onto Li Yuande and following him wherever he tried to escape. This was because Luo Tian was controlling the dragon with his powerful divine sense.

Seeing there was no hope of escape, Li Yuande gritted his teeth and channeled all his essence energy. He roared: “Dustless Golden Shield.”

Soon, three golden shields of essence energy appeared in front of Li Yuande. He was prepared to take Luo Tian’s attack head-on.

Chapter Nine: First Alchemy

The Dustless Golden Shield is a defensive martial technique of the Li Clan. Li Yuande’s ability to instantly cast three Yellow-level martial techniques demonstrates his strength.

However, Luo Tian’s Dragon Hand of Flame is even more extraordinary. It incorporates the cycle of five elements, surpassing ordinary martial techniques and rivaling high-level Yellow-grade techniques.

The dragon of fire dove down, accompanied by three crisp sounds. In an instant, it shattered all three shields.

A scream of agony echoed as Li Yuande was pushed back more than ten meters, his breath gone. He clearly wouldn’t survive.

Li Xiuran looked at Luo Tian in a daze, his legs trembling uncontrollably. His uncle was a fourth-level Body Refinement powerhouse; even in Tianyuan City, he was one of the top martial artists. Yet, he had been defeated so thoroughly by Luo Tian.
