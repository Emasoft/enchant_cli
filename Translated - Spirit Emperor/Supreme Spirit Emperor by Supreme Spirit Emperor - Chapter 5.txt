Lo Tian took a deep breath and glanced at Li Xiuran, his eyes gleaming with mockery: “Next is you!”

“Ah! You can’t kill me, my father is the head of the Li family. If you do, they will never forgive you!” Li Xiuran exclaimed.

“At this point, do you think I still fear the Li family’s retaliation?” Lo Tian said with a sardonic smile, watching Li Xiuran.

“It was my mistake. Please forgive me, I will repay you someday,” Li Xiuran pleaded as he realized the situation was dire.

“How do you plan to repay me? If your words move me, I might spare your life!” Lo Tian smiled, a smile he thought was very amiable, but it made Li Xiuran shudder.

Watching Lo Tian’s smile, Li Xiuran felt as if a demon was smiling at him. He trembled and could not speak.

“Alright, I will spare you this time! But it’s not out of kindness. Go back and tell your dead father that Lo Tian will come for you soon!” Without waiting for Li Xiuran to respond, Lo Tian said magnanimously.

“Yes, yes!” Li Xiuran wanted nothing more than to leave. Upon hearing Lo Tian’s words, he turned and left hurriedly.

“Wait!” Just as Li Xiuran was about to turn away, Lo Tian’s cold voice rang out.

“What?” Already overjoyed, Li Xiuran turned back quickly, thinking Lo Tian had changed his mind. His legs trembled and he fell to the ground, even a yellow liquid flowed down his pants.

“Don’t let me see you again. If I do, you will meet the same fate as your fat guard! Leave!” Lo Tian waved dismissively.

“Okay, okay, I’m leaving now!” Li Xiuran trembled as he glanced at Lo Tian and ran away. His speed surprised even Lo Tian.

Feeling Li Xiuran had left, Lo Tian’s legs weakened and he fainted.

Gu Qianxue opened her eyes. After the medicinal pill’s recovery, she looked at Lo Tian and Li Yuande on the ground with shock.

Although she had been observing outside while recovering her energy, when she heard Li Yuande’s arrival, despair filled her heart. Gu Qianxue never expected Lo Tian to defeat Li Yuande.

Seeing the mess around her, Gu Qianxue was still deeply impressed by Lo Tian’s martial arts.

When she saw Li Yuande’s corpse, Gu Qianxue’s eyes narrowed. She sighed internally, realizing that Tianyuan City was about to change. Gu Qianxue knew Li Yuande’s significant position in the Li family, and it was unlikely that the head of the Li family, Li Feihong, would tolerate this.

Gu Qianxue then looked at the guards around her. A cold look flashed in her eyes, and she decisively shattered their dantian, stripping them of their cultivation. If not, they would surely participate in the Li family’s future retaliation.

Sighing lightly, Gu Qianxue looked at Lo Tian, who was unconscious on the ground. She took a recovery pill and placed it in his mouth.

After taking the pill, Lo Tian’s complexion improved slightly but he still did not wake up. Gu Qianxue gritted her teeth, hesitated for a moment, and then carried Lo Tian.

Gu Qianxue, who had never been so close to a man before, blushed slightly. But fearing the Li family’s retaliation if she delayed any longer, she carried Lo Tian back to her home. His breath on her ear made her weak and soft.

She threw Lo Tian onto his bed, already drenched in sweat. She sighed lightly and headed towards Gu Yun’s courtyard to inform her father about the situation.

The next morning, Lo Tian yawned comfortably and stretched. He had never slept so soundly. Recalling yesterday’s events, he was invigorated. As for how he returned home, Lo Tian guessed it must have been Gu Qianxue.

Without further thought, Lo Tian began his first attempt at alchemy. Previously, he could only study the theory but not practice it due to the immense resources required.

His first attempt at alchemy was both tense and exciting, but the result was disappointing. He had already blown up three cauldrons without successfully refining a single pill.

“Why? I followed the steps meticulously,” Lo Tian frowned, recovering his energy while pondering.

After regaining his energy, Lo Tian entered a frenzied alchemy mode. For seven days straight, he did not leave his small courtyard, blowing up countless cauldrons and wasting numerous herbs without success.

The only consolation was that his cultivation improved significantly, as did his spiritual perception.

That morning, Lo Tian looked at the cauldron with a grave expression. He was out of ingredients and if he failed again, he would have to temporarily halt his alchemy plans. Continuing might even provoke Gu Yun’s wrath.

Lo Tian calmed himself, took a deep breath, and skillfully placed the main ingredients in the cauldron. His palm touched the fire source, igniting a flame that entered the cauldron.

Recalling the formula from the Jiyuan Book, he guided a Tianxingcao into the cauldron.

Soon, the essence of the Tianxingcao was extracted, followed by Ziyuancao and Ningxuezhi.

The flames in the cauldron illuminated Lo Tian’s serious face as he focused on the swirling fire.

The herbs gradually melted into a concentrated essence, emitting a faint aroma.

Lo Tian carefully controlled the fire. When he felt it was right, he shouted: “Concentrate!”

A muffled sound echoed as the cauldron’s lid flew off, releasing a delicate fragrance.

Lo Tian leaned down and saw several round red pills inside the cauldron.

“It’s done, finally!” Lo Tian was elated. He opened a jade bottle and placed the pills inside.

Lo Tian had successfully refined the Yiqi Qutie Pill, a first-grade pill with much stronger effects than ordinary pills. He attributed his previous failures to the uniqueness of this pill, unaware that beginners often struggle for months with ordinary pills.

If Lo Tian’s thoughts were known to others, their reactions would be intriguing.

Looking at his month-long effort, Lo Tian’s excitement lingered. It felt like a new door had opened before him.

“With this pill, my strength can finally be enhanced again!”

Chapter Ten: Dragon and Tiger Qi

Lo Tian swallowed all the pills at once, then began circulating his energy to fully assimilate their power.

The Yiqi Qutie Pill’s potency was much stronger, immediately transforming into energy and uncontrollably surging through his body.

Lo Tian was startled. He had not expected the pill to be so potent, potentially leading to his death.

Fortunately, Wuxing Huayuan Gong was incredibly powerful, assimilating the pill’s energy much faster than ordinary techniques. Soon, the energy condensed into pure essence and gathered in his dantian.

The enhancement took two days. When Lo Tian opened his eyes, he had reached the peak of the third stage of Body Refinement.

“I killed Li Yuande. The Li family will not let it go. With my current strength, even with Wuxing Huayuan Gong as a trump card, I can’t compete with the head of the Li family. I must break through to the fourth stage of Body Refinement to pose a threat!” Lo Tian’s eyes gleamed. He then swallowed the Longhu Dantian Pill.

A force ten times stronger than the Yiqi Qutie Pill surged into his body, like a mountain tiger. The Longhu Dantian Pill contained the essence of a tiger.

Lo Tian was startled and exerted all his strength to stabilize this force with Wuxing Huayuan Gong.

Before he could catch his breath, another even more violent force emerged from the pill, accompanied by a faint roar. The pill contained the essence of a dragon.

The Longhu Dantian Pill was a second-grade pill, but with the addition of a drop of blood from both a dragon and a tiger, its potency rivaled that of a third-grade pill.

However, few knew the true Longhu Dantian Pill contained not just their essence but also their power.

Ordinarily, even triggering the tiger’s power was difficult. But Lo Tian triggered both the dragon and tiger powers simultaneously, a nearly impossible feat that left him amused yet frustrated.

The combined power of the dragon and tiger was too violent for a third-stage Body Refiner to handle.

“Am I going to be killed by this pill? No, I won’t die like this! If my cultivation can’t refine it, then I will use my physical body!” Lo Tian decided to focus on refining the tiger’s power while using a small portion of his attention to protect his meridians and organs from the dragon’s power.

However, Lo Tian underestimated the dragon’s power. As it surged through his body, he nearly fainted from pain.

Fainting meant the end!

Just as Lo Tian was about to give up, a golden light emerged from the Jiyuan Book in his shi hai.

The rebellious dragon power became docile and entered Lo Tian’s dantian.

Lo Tian sighed in relief, marveling at the Jiyuan Book’s power. Without it, he would have died twice.

While Lo Tian was refining the Longhu Dantian Pill, Li Feihong, head of the Li family, was listening to Li Xiuran recount Lo Tian’s battle with Li Yuande.

When he heard that Lo Tian had killed Li Yuande in one move, Li Feihong spat out blood and roared: “Yuande! How could you be gone so soon after I closed my retreat? The Gu family will pay for this!”

In a fit of rage, Li Feihong gathered the Li family and headed towards the Gu family.

Gu Yun had been uneasy these days. He was both shocked by Lo Tian’s rapid strength growth and worried about the Li family’s retaliation, which had not come yet.

Today, Gu Yun was deep in thought in his study. Suddenly, his eyes lit up: “They’re here!”

He put down his teacup and headed towards the Gu family gate.

Seeing Li Feihong, their long-time rival, leading the Li family with a fierce demeanor to the Gu family gate, Gu Yun said loudly: “Li Feihong, do you intend to start a war with our family?”

“Gu Yun, no more talk. My brother Li Yuande was killed by Lo Tian. Hand him over or face eternal enmity!” Li Feihong roared, his eyes wild.

“Li Feihong, I won’t hand him over. But I can offer some compensation,” Gu Yun replied.

“Seems you’re determined to protect that boy. Then prepare for war!” Li Feihong’s face darkened, surprised by Gu Yun’s firm refusal.

“War it is! We are ready!” Gu Yun responded, his aura matching Li Feihong’s.

Seeing no hope for negotiation, Li Feihong’s energy surged. He dashed forward and struck Gu Yun with a golden fist.

Gu Yun, familiar with Li Feihong’s fighting style, prepared his technique. A huge red palm appeared and met the golden fist.

“Boom…” The shockwave made everyone’s ears hurt, and they retreated several steps.

Li Feihong attacked relentlessly. They fought for half an hour before Li Feihong stopped and said: “Li family, form the Jin Gang Luo Yuan Array!”

The Li family members immediately acted. Golden lights appeared under their feet, converging into a golden barrier around the Gu family.

From afar, it looked like a giant bowl covering the entire Gu family compound.

The Gu family tried to break through but were repelled back.

Li Feihong watched and laughed: “Gu Yun, you should have felt I was about to break through. Give me a month; if you don’t hand over that boy, I will destroy the Gu family after my breakthrough!”

Chapter Eleven: Gu Yun’s Decision

The Jin Gang Luo Yuan Array was a third-grade formation, the strongest array the Li family could set up. It isolated the Gu family from the outside world and even blocked vital elemental energy for cultivators.

Body Refinement stage martial artists relied heavily on elemental energy. Without it, they were just stronger ordinary people.

Seeing the Jin Gang Luo Yuan Array, Gu Yun’s face darkened. If trapped for long, his family would be vulnerable.

Gu Yun could temporarily reach the sixth stage of Body Refinement with medicinal pills, but breaking through the array would leave him weakened. Li Feihong would then take advantage of his weakness to destroy the Gu family.

Seeing Li Feihong leave, Gu Yun’s face darkened. He turned to the crowd: “Gather everyone in the council hall!”

As the Gu family worried about breaking through the Jin Gang Luo Yuan Array, Lo Tian was unaware and continued refining the Longhu Dantian Pill.

In the Gu family council hall, Gu Yun sat at the main seat. Important elders were seated on both sides. The atmosphere was tense, and everyone’s brows were furrowed.

“Head of the family, nearly two weeks have passed. Should we hand over that boy?” asked the third elder tentatively.

“No!” Gu Yun glared at the third elder. Seeing everyone silent, he knew they did not oppose.

“Uncle, if we give up anyone the Li family demands, what dignity does our Gu family have?” Gu Qianxue spoke up.

Though young, no one dared to underestimate her. She was already at the fourth stage of Body Refinement and had dual-elemental energy, promising a bright future. Most respected her greatly, but not the third elder.

Ignoring Gu Qianxue, the third elder stared at Gu Yun: “That boy isn’t even from our family. Why risk so much to protect him? Is it just his potential? Remember, talent doesn’t guarantee strength. One must survive to become strong!”

The third elder’s words were harsh, even implying Gu Qianxue. Gu Yun frowned.

But Gu Yun remained composed and looked at the other elders: “What suggestions do you have?”

The elders debated, some suggesting protecting Lo Tian to maintain the family’s reputation, others advocating handing him over to avoid conflict with the Li family.
