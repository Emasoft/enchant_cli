However, Luo Tian did not know that by merely reprimanding Zhang Qi, he had inadvertently created a significant trouble for himself.

Luo Tian ignored the fallen Zhang Qi and Gu Lei, along with Gu Qianxue. Upon seeing Zhang Qi, a flash of cold light appeared in their eyes. Especially Gu Lei; if it were not for the difficulty of descending and then ascending again, he might have gone down to give Zhang Qi a beating. Although this was within the Wu Xing Sect, venting one’s anger with a thrashing was still permissible.

The three continued walking forward. By the time they reached the three hundred and fiftieth level, even Gu Lei, who was the weakest among them, began to struggle. His already obese body gradually became drenched in sweat.

Seeing Gu Lei’s condition, Luo Tian sighed inwardly. Even with his fourth-stage Body Refinement cultivation, Gu Lei could only persist until the three hundred and fiftieth level. Previously, Luo Tian had observed that Gu Lei was of average to above-average quality among those participating in the assessment.

“Hang on a little longer, we’re almost at four hundred. I have a feeling there’s something amiss with this Heavenly Stairway; let’s try to persist for as long as possible!” Luo Tian said softly.

“Right!” Gu Lei wiped the sweat from his forehead, knowing he was the weakest among them. He gritted his teeth and continued climbing.

Chapter 26: Carrying You Up ()

“Three hundred seventy-seven!”

“Three hundred seventy-eight! Three hundred seventy-nine!” Gu Lei counted each step, but the weight on his feet grew increasingly heavy. The pressure from the Heavenly Stairway made it hard for him to breathe.

Seeing Gu Lei unable to hold on any longer, Luo Tian said softly, “Qianxue, you support him from one side; let’s carry him up to the four hundredth level!”

“Right!” Gu Qianxue nodded lightly, supporting one of Gu Lei’s arms while Luo Tian supported the other. The two carried him upward.

“Damn! This is allowed? Isn’t this cheating?” A group of people watching the three climb up exclaimed in disbelief.

“This is cheating! We protest!” Another group lying around the three hundredth level shouted.

“Hmph! Are you questioning Wu Xing Sect?” Kong Deming snorted coldly, and no one dared to speak further.

Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue carried Gu Lei all the way up to the four hundredth level. As soon as they placed him down, Gu Lei collapsed on the steps and a trace of blood seeped from his skin.

“Try to hold on for a little longer!” Luo Tian instructed again before continuing upward with Gu Qianxue.

Beyond the four hundredth level, only a dozen people remained. Zhang Hongyun was still in first place, with the second being a young man in black robes. The two were at around the six hundredth level, neither willing to give way. The remaining few scattered across various steps.

“Brother Feng, it’s really you! Looks like we’ll have to compete again today. Remember the last competition was two years ago?” Zhang Hongyun smiled lightly, but his feet did not slow down.

“Hmph! Zhang Hongyun, I have already lost once; today, I will not lose again!” The man called Brother Feng growled, his pace gradually increasing.

Seeing the two clearly accelerate, those below envied them: “True geniuses! They can still maintain such speed at over six hundred levels. Sigh…”

“Cut it out, do you know who they are? The first one is the Young Master of Wenti City, Zhang Hongyun. The second is the Young Master of Fengyu City, Feng Qianyu. They have been competing for a long time; it is said that two years ago, Feng Qianyu lost to Zhang Hongyun by a single move and has been gān bù ever since. It seems these two will be the stars of today!” Two young men sitting on the three hundredth level steps discussed.

Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue walked steadily to the five hundredth level, with only about ten people ahead of them.

At this point, Gu Qianxue was also struggling to persist. Sweat trickled down her forehead in fine beads, but she gritted her teeth and continued on. After all, Gu Qianxue was only at the fourth-stage Body Refinement level, a significant gap from those ahead.

Seeing Gu Qianxue struggling, Luo Tian stepped up to the next level and turned back: “Come up; I’ll carry you to the six hundredth level!”

Hearing Luo Tian’s casual words, Gu Qianxue was momentarily stunned. She did not immediately understand what he meant but then blushed: “No, you go ahead; I’ll manage to walk up slowly.”

“Although I don’t know the purpose of this Heavenly Stairway now, I have a feeling that the higher you climb, the greater the benefits!” Luo Tian said seriously.

Seeing Luo Tian’s determination, Gu Qianxue hesitated but noticed the unusual clarity in his eyes. She gritted her teeth and wrapped her arms around Luo Tian’s neck.

Although Gu Qianxue was light, the pressure on the Heavenly Stairway made it slightly difficult for Luo Tian to carry both of them, but he slowly ascended.

“Damn! Is there no law? This is allowed? That guy, is he human or a freak? First carrying someone and now actually carrying them up? How are we supposed to live?” A commotion arose.

People stared in shock at Luo Tian, amazed by his strength. He dared to carry someone up the five hundredth level, and though the woman on his back was beautiful, it was still quite presumptuous.

Kong Deming and Zhang Daoyi’s eyes narrowed at Luo Tian’s actions, as they had never seen anyone carry someone up the Heavenly Stairway before.

Kong Deming was even more astonished by Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue’s strength. With her fourth-stage Body Refinement cultivation, it was already extraordinary for Gu Qianxue to reach this point.

But Luo Tian was even more extraordinary. He showed no signs of any Nascent Qi fluctuations, indistinguishable from an ordinary person. In other words, Luo Tian was walking solely on his physical strength without using any internal Qi.

Kong Deming did not know that one of them had a dual Wood and Fire attribute constitution, while the other was said to be a legendary Wu Xing Body.

Gu Qianxue felt an overwhelming sense of happiness as she lay on Luo Tian’s back. She did not understand why he insisted on carrying her higher, but she knew he would never harm her.

Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu turned back, watching Luo Tian carry Gu Qianxue. They both sighed in admiration; if he were not carrying someone, he might have been a formidable competitor. But now, there was no need to take him seriously.

Sweat trickled down Luo Tian’s forehead as he struggled upward, ignoring others’ gazes. His spirit was intensely focused, his eyes fixated on the steps.

“Five hundred ninety-eight! Five hundred ninety-nine! Six hundred!” Luo Tian growled, placing Gu Qianxue on the six hundredth level.

Gu Qianxue looked at Luo Tian with concern, unsure of what to say.

As soon as he placed Gu Qianxue down, Luo Tian felt a wave of relief and an unusual strengthening sensation in his body.

A flash of insight struck Luo Tian, and he finally understood the Heavenly Stairway’s peculiar nature: “So this Heavenly Stairway actually has Body Refinement effects. The higher you climb, the stronger your physical body becomes when you descend!”

Realizing this, Luo Tian reached into his robes and took out a Spirit Marrow Pill, placing it in Gu Qianxue’s hand: “Eat this. If you can go higher, do so; the Heavenly Stairway enhances your constitution, and the higher you climb, the more pronounced the effect!”

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Gu Qianxue was shocked by Wu Xing Sect’s strength. Without hesitation, she swallowed the Spirit Marrow Pill.

Seeing Gu Qianxue take the pill, Luo Tian looked ahead at the four people in front. Though he did not recognize all of them, he had seen three of them during his previous visit to Xuantian City.

Taking a deep breath, he released some cultivation energy and stepped onto the six hundred and first level.

“Good heavens, this guy is not human! He’s only at the fifth-stage Body Refinement and hasn’t used any Nascent Qi yet?” A man at the fifth-stage Body Refinement exclaimed in jealousy.

“Seems so!” The person beside him stared at Luo Tian as if he were a monster.

Chapter 27: Catching Up ()

“Who is this guy? Which city’s Young Master? Why haven’t I heard of him?” People began speculating about Luo Tian’s identity.

Gu Lei had already been taken off the steps, watching Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue from below. He felt proud; if he shouted that one was his sister and the other his brother, would people gather around him?

Luo Tian ignored the murmurs and continued climbing steadily. He looked up at Zhang Hongyun and Jin Sui, who were on the seven hundred and fiftieth level, followed by Feng Qianyu. He smiled faintly and pursued the fourth place.

“That guy is about to surpass the fourth!” People below sighed in admiration.

The person in fourth place could not move past the seven hundredth level and sat on the steps, unwilling to be defeated by this unknown youth. However, his legs felt like they were not his own and could not move.

Luo Tian slowly reached the seven hundredth level, where the pressure increased several times. He was already at his limit but gritted his teeth and continued upward.

“Seven hundred twenty-one! Seven hundred twenty-two! Seven hundred twenty-three!” Luo Tian muttered the step numbers, his face flushed. He resisted the urge to vomit blood as fine traces of blood seeped from his pores.

Normally, Luo Tian’s physical strength and cultivation could have reached the seven hundred fiftieth level without difficulty, but carrying Gu Lei and then Gu Qianxue had significantly drained him.

“This guy! He’s truly extraordinary! A fifth-stage Body Refinement cultivator reaching over seven hundred levels. How do we feel, those of us who can only reach five hundred? Fortunately, he stopped; if he had continued, we could have committed suicide!” People watched in awe as Luo Tian finally stopped.

Seeing Luo Tian stop, Zhang Hongyun’s eyes flashed with respect. He himself could not reach the seven hundredth level as a fifth-stage Body Refinement cultivator.

“Fourth place, not bad. But I don’t want to let my seniors down!” Luo Tian smiled lightly, speaking in a barely audible voice.

The person sitting on the seven hundredth level widened his eyes: “This freak, does he intend to continue climbing?”

In the shocked gaze of the young man, Luo Tian held a black pill—Spirit Marrow Pill!

Luo Tian tossed the Spirit Marrow Pill into his mouth and felt a cool sensation spread throughout his body.

“What is this guy doing?” People wondered, their eyes fixed on Luo Tian. Even he did not notice the majority of people’s attention was on him, curious about this young man who kept surprising them.

Zhang Hongyun had already reached the seven hundred and ninetieth level, his face no longer showing any ease. He was struggling but continued climbing steadily.

Feng Qianyu was the same, his forehead drenched in sweat as he followed closely behind Zhang Hongyun.

What surprised people was the third person, like Luo Tian, previously unknown but now closely following Feng Qianyu.

As Luo Tian absorbed the Spirit Marrow Pill, unexpectedly, there was a surge of Nascent Qi at the six hundredth level.

People looked down to see Gu Qianxue, the beautiful woman Luo Tian had carried up to six hundred levels. She was sitting on the steps in a dark green dress, her eyes closed and face serious.

The surrounding Nascent Qi continuously converged toward Gu Qianxue, forming a visible vortex of red and green Qi that entered her body.

As the Nascent Qi entered, black impurities continuously emerged from her body.

Due to the Heavenly Stairway’s pressure, these impurities were not left on Gu Qianxue’s skin but directly pressed onto the steps.

After a quarter of an hour, the Nascent Qi stopped entering Gu Qianxue’s body. She opened her eyes with a look of joy: “Fifth-stage Body Refinement!”

People below the Heavenly Stairway stared in disbelief at Gu Qianxue on the six hundredth level, their minds racing: “Is this even possible?”

They felt they had said this phrase the most today, never expecting anyone to break through under such intense pressure.

“No, didn’t you see her Nascent Qi vortex? It was dual-colored—green and red! She has a dual attribute constitution!” People exclaimed.

“Ha ha! I like this girl; none of you dare to compete with me!” An elderly man in his fifties shouted from a secluded courtyard at Wu Xing Sect’s back mountain.

“Hmph! Old poison master, who wouldn’t want a dual-attribute genius?” Another old man blew his beard and glared.

“Enough, stop arguing. This is just the first test; there are two more to come. You can argue then! It’s been a long time since you’ve seen each other; why do you start arguing the moment you meet?” A woman-like figure said calmly.

“That’s right, that’s right!” The surrounding voices echoed in agreement.

If Kong Deming were present, he would be astonished by the casual demeanor of Wu Xing Sect’s five peak masters, so unlike their usual solemnity.

Gu Qianxue was unaware that she had caught the attention of these high-ranking peak masters. At this moment, her eyes were fixed on Luo Tian sitting at the seven hundred and twentieth level.

“I can’t let him get too far ahead!” Gu Qianxue said calmly, lifting her steps and slowly ascending to the six hundredth level…

“Wood and Fire dual attribute constitution? Although unexpected, it’s still a bit qiáng to surpass Zhang Hongyun!” Kong Deming judged silently how far Gu Qianxue could go.

“Look! That beauty has reached the seven hundredth level!” People marveled at Gu Qianxue’s strength, many young men admiring her.

“Too bad she has a man; if I were that handsome, she would fall in love with me!” A robust young man said.

“Spit! Shameless, how many narcissists are there now?” Disapproving voices echoed around.

At this moment, Gu Qianxue had already left a deep impression on people. She was naturally beautiful, extremely strong, and possessed extraordinary talent—what more could one ask for?

The young man sitting at the seven hundredth level was filled with bitterness. Initially, he could accept being pushed to fifth place by Luo Tian, but with Gu Qianxue’s arrival, he was kicked out of the top five.

Every year, Wu Xing Sect recruits disciples; those who enter the top five usually have peak masters come to take them as disciples. The young man struggled to stand and continue climbing but was held back by the overwhelming pressure, only able to watch as the beautiful woman passed him, leaving a lingering fragrance.

Gu Qianxue walked past the young man without looking and approached Luo Tian, who was sitting on the steps.

Chapter 28: Peak Master ()

“Eight hundred!” Zhang Hongyun’s forehead veins bulged, breathing heavily as he stood on the eight hundredth level and looked down at Wu Xing Mountain.

However, when his gaze fell on Feng Qianyu, who had reached the seven hundred and eighty-fifth level, his eyes narrowed: “These two are truly troublesome!”

“This time, I will not lose to you!” Feng Qianyu looked up at Zhang Hongyun, his sole opponent being Zhang Hongyun.

“Unexpectedly, there are such talented young men even in small cities!” The third-place black-robed youth sneered and walked forward.

Gu Qianxue reached Luo Tian, saw him closing his eyes to refine the pill, and sat down to wait for him.

Luo Tian was desperately refining the Spirit Marrow Pill. Black substances fell from his skin, and he could feel his bones becoming as translucent as jade. The medicinal power continuously refined his meridians, without any pain but a cool sensation.

After the refinement was complete, Luo Tian opened his eyes and growled: “Sixth-stage Body Refinement, open up!”

A violent Nascent Qi vortex formed around him as he absorbed the surrounding Nascent Qi like a whale.

Below, people watching Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu felt an energy fluctuation and turned their attention to Luo Tian.

At this moment, Luo Tian’s hair fluttered in the wind, standing beside the incomparably beautiful Gu Qianxue. They seemed to be a perfect match.

After being refined by the Spirit Marrow Pill, Luo Tian’s previously ordinary appearance became somewhat handsome.

“Does this guy also intend to advance?” People wondered, then laughed in disbelief.
