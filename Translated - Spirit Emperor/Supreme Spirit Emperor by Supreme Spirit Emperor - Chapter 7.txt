Lo Tian had already felt a sense of despair when suddenly, this new force joined in. With the addition of the red primordial energy, the Great Seal finally took shape.

Lo Tian roared: “Five Elements Cycle Seal, First Seal, Human King Seal! Go!”

“Hum…” The massive seal emitted a piercing hum, and then disappeared from Lo Tian’s hand, reappearing above Li Feihong.

Li Feihong never expected that Lo Tian would succeed. He tried to escape, but there was no chance left; a terrifying pressure made it difficult for Li Feihong to breathe.

“Bang!” The seal fell heavily, sending up a cloud of dust. Both Gu Yun and Wang Pengfei, who had already separated from Li Feihong, looked at Lo Tian with fear, secretly relieved that he hadn’t targeted them.

As the dust cleared, Li Feihong, who had just advanced to Sixth Stage Body Refinement, lay in a pool of blood, his fate uncertain.

Lo Tian smiled faintly: “Li Xiuping, this is merely the first step! Soon enough, I will have you under my feet!”

Seeing Li Feihong’s uncertain fate, a brief calm fell over the Li family gate. Everyone thought: “One of the three great families of Tianyuan City, the Li family, is finished!”

“Ah… you all must die!” A cold and sorrowful voice echoed. With the sound, several figures appeared with terrifying pressure.

Hearing the cold voice, Lo Tian’s heart tightened. He clenched his fists tightly, a trace of blood slowly flowing down his palm as he gritted his teeth and growled: “Li Xiuping!”

Chapter 14 - Li Xiuping

“You all must die!” The cold voice echoed in everyone’s ears.

As the sound spread, several figures appeared before the unconscious Li Feihong. A young man in white clothes picked up Li Feihong, his face filled with grief.

“Li Xiuping!” Lo Tian gritted his teeth and looked at the grieving young man, feeling a tinge of satisfaction. Looking at the one who had ruined everything for him, Lo Tian sighed deeply, feeling that even if he died here today, it would be worth it.

“How? Li Xiuping? Does your heart hurt? Do you regret not killing me back then?” Lo Tian sneered, mocking the once high and mighty man.

Li Xiuping glared at Lo Tian with a狰狞 look. He had once considered him an ant, but now he couldn’t believe that this waste could turn the tables.

“Wang Fan, go and capture him for me! I want to tear his body into a thousand pieces!” Li Xiuping said to Wang Fan, who had come with him. He himself followed an elderly man in his sixties and began to treat Li Feihong with all his might.

“Alright!” Wang Fan hesitated for a moment, looking at Lo Tian with a complex expression. He couldn’t help but recall the cold look and laughable boasts of Lo Tian when he was expelled from the mountain gate.

Wang Fan couldn’t believe that in just a few months, this waste he could once crush with his bare hands had grown to the point where he could bring down an entire Li family. How did he do it?

Questions flooded Wang Fan’s mind, but for now, capturing Lo Tian was the priority. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to explain it to Li Xiuping. Thinking of Li Xiuping’s terrifying power, Wang Fan shuddered.

“Lo Tian, you really are a surprise. But now that you’re so weak, it’s best to surrender quietly. Don’t make me have to act myself!” Wang Fan walked up to Lo Tian and said coolly.

“Want to catch me? We’ll see if you have the ability!” Lo Tian’s eyes showed a look of madness, and in his hand were two brown pills.

“Exploding Body Pill!” Seeing the two Exploding Body Pills in Lo Tian’s hand, Wang Fan sneered at his overestimation of himself.

Lo Tian was already weak and had previously taken one Exploding Body Pill. Taking two more now would be like adding insult to injury. Wang Fan believed that his meridians couldn’t withstand the impact of the pill’s power.

However, Lo Tian didn’t care. He 毫不犹豫地 threw the pills into his mouth and sat cross-legged to refine them, knowing that refining two Exploding Body Pills was no easy task.

“Hmph! Do you really think you can refine pills in front of me? You’re dreaming!” Wang Fan sneered and rushed towards Lo Tian, whose face was flushed.

Wang Fan extended a red palm toward Lo Tian’s dantian. If he succeeded, even at his peak, Lo Tian wouldn’t escape being crippled.

Gu Yun and Wang Pengfei saw Lo Tian’s predicament but were powerless to help. They wanted to assist, but they themselves were also weak and had closed their eyes in despair.

Gu Yun kept praying that the senior was watching over them. Otherwise, not only Lo Tian but also the Gu and Wang families would be buried with Li Feihong.

“Bang!” Fierce fire energy erupted.

“Fire and Wood dual attribute body type!” Wang Fan was incredulous, unable to believe that such a genius existed in the small Tianyuan City and hadn’t been discovered by Feiyunmen.

“Qianxue!” Gu Yun saw the young woman, Gu Qianxue, standing before Lo Tian and showed a look of surprise. She was the only one on their side with enough strength to fight.

“Hmph, what does being a dual attribute genius matter? A mere Fourth Stage Body Refiner like you wants to fight me?” Wang Fan’s body trembled as his Fifth Stage Body Refinement power radiated.

“Although Gu Qianxue is a dual attribute genius, she’s only at Fourth Stage Body Refinement. Compared to me, a Fifth Stage Body Refiner and disciple of Feiyunmen, she’s no match,” Wang Fan thought as he rushed towards Gu Qianxue.

Gu Qianxue, exhausted from the previous battle and a level lower in cultivation, was quickly suppressed by Wang Fan. When she tried to release the Great Falling Sun Palm technique, she couldn’t hold on and was struck in the back by Wang Fan, spitting out blood.

Wang Fan stood before Gu Qianxue and sighed in regret. This should have been a heavenly maiden, but she was about to fall at the hands of an average disciple from Feiyunmen.

Without any mercy, Wang Fan raised his hand and struck Gu Qianxue’s head.

“Roar!” At this critical moment, a dragon roar sounded, causing Wang Fan to hesitate slightly.

In that instant, a figure appeared before Wang Fan, delivering a powerful punch that sent him flying. The fist was covered in five colors.

“Five… Five Elements Body! Fifth Stage Body Refinement!” Wang Fan trembled as he looked at the Lo Tian enveloped in five-colored primordial energy.

Lo Tian was surrounded by five colorful dragon-shaped streams of primordial energy, exuding the aura of a Fifth Stage Body Refiner.

Lying on the ground, Wang Fan couldn’t believe his eyes. He never expected Lo Tian to become a legendary Five Elements Body.

Li Xiuping and the elderly man, who were treating Li Feihong, also looked at Lo Tian in disbelief. They couldn’t understand how he had become a Five Elements Body.

Lo Tian felt unprecedentedly powerful. He successfully used the power of the Exploding Body Pill to trigger the latent power of the Dragon-Tiger Body Refinement Pill, advancing to Fifth Stage Body Refinement.

Although he had just entered Fifth Stage Body Refinement, as a Five Elements Body, Lo Tian was far beyond Wang Fan’s reach. A simple punch sent the Fifth Stage Body Refiner flying.

Wang Fan stood up, wiping blood from his mouth: “Hmph! So what if you’re a Five Elements Body? You’ve just entered Fifth Stage Body Refinement!”

“But that’s enough to deal with you!” Lo Tian sneered, like a human beast charging at Wang Fan.

“Hmph! Do you really think I’m that easy to deal with? Snow Rain Imperial Seal!” Wang Fan didn’t underestimate Lo Tian and used his martial technique.

A deep red seal flew from Wang Fan’s hand, radiating waves as it headed toward Lo Tian.

Lo Tian smiled playfully, his fists clenched. He didn’t release any martial techniques but roared and charged at the blood-red seal.

Seeing Lo Tian’s disdain, Wang Fan sneered. His martial technique was a mid-stage Yellow Rank skill; he believed even the most abnormal Lo Tian couldn’t withstand it.

The exhausted Gu Yun and Gu Qianxue watched with confidence. Lo Tian had defeated the Sixth Stage Body Refiner Li Feihong using an Exploding Body Pill, so defeating Wang Fan at Fifth Stage Body Refinement was no problem.

Compared to Wang Fan, Gu Yun was more concerned about Li Xiuping and the elderly man treating Li Feihong. Their auras made him tremble with helplessness.

Just as Gu Yun was worried, Lo Tian’s fist met Wang Fan’s Snow Rain Imperial Seal with a deafening sound.

Chapter 15 - Two Young Men

“Bang…” The earth-shaking sound echoed.

Wang Fan was stunned by the scene. He couldn’t believe that his confident martial technique had been broken with bare hands.

Before Wang Fan could react, Lo Tian turned into a blur and appeared before him. A primordial energy-filled fist landed on Wang Fan’s dantian, while his other hand grabbed Wang Fan by the neck and lifted him.

“Lo… Lo Tian, what are you doing? You can’t kill me! I’m from Feiyunmen!” Wang Fan was terrified.

“Oh, Feiyunmen. Since I’m probably going to die here today anyway, might as well take you with me!” Lo Tian sneered.

Before Lo Tian could tighten his grip, an unprecedented pressure made him gradually loosen his fingers.

“It’s over!” Li Xiuping in white clothes stood there, expressionless, as if nothing had happened. His tone was calm.

Those familiar with Li Xiuping knew that the calmer he appeared, the angrier he was inside. Only killing could appease his anger, as seen when a family offended him and mysteriously disappeared the next day.

“I never thought an insect could cause such a stir!” Li Xiuping looked at Lo Tian calmly, pressure emanating from his body.

Lo Tian’s face was drenched in cold sweat as he smiled: “Now regretting it? I’m the one without shoes, so killing you is worth it. Kill one and break even, kill two and make a profit. Clearly, I’m making a profit!”

“Yes, letting you go last time cost me dearly. So this time, you must die!” Li Xiuping smiled calmly, but to Lo Tian, it was terrifying.

Lo Tian had never underestimated Li Xiuping. He didn’t expect him to be not only powerful but also terrifyingly composed, remaining calm after his father’s death. Lo Tian couldn’t do the same.

“Before I saw you as an ant, and now I still do. Just a bit stronger!” Li Xiuping stood tall in white clothes, his finger slowly pointing at Lo Tian.

“Hum…” Lo Tian felt as if he was stuck in a swamp, unable to move an inch.

Cold sweat flowed down Lo Tian’s face. He couldn’t believe Li Xiuping was so powerful; he estimated that Li Xiuping was at least Eighth Stage Body Refinement.

Li Xiuping took two steps forward, and Lo Tian felt the primordial energy around him become chaotic. The pressure increased several times.

Seeing Lo Tian struggling to hold on, Gu Yun’s face contorted as he forced himself up and shouted at the elderly man: “Feiyunmen, have you forgotten your rules? The sect cannot interfere in family conflicts!”

“Merely a Tianyuan City family, daring to meddle with Feiyunmen’s affairs? What are you?” The elderly man sneered.

“Tell me, what is Feiyunmen? Do they dare to be so arrogant with just Ninth Stage Body Refinement?” A domineering voice echoed like thunder, causing the Feiyunmen elder to retreat and spit blood.

Under Li Xiuping’s pressure, Lo Tian, who was barely holding on, felt the weight lift as he heard the loud voice.

Lo Tian panted heavily, his back drenched in sweat. He looked curiously at the two figures approaching—a tall and a slender one.

Li Xiuping also looked intently at them, saying quietly: “Bone Dissolution Realm!”

The elder who had been struck showed no resentment but a hint of respect. As a Feiyunmen elder, he had little震慑力 against the Bone Dissolution Realm.

The two walked into the crowd and approached Lo Tian, examining him closely.

People gasped in shock not at their power but at their youth. Li Xiuping, who considered himself a genius, felt inferior.

One was robust with explosive power and surrounded by green primordial energy. The other was clad in black, exuding coldness with dark primordial energy.

“This is our little junior brother? He doesn’t look very sturdy!” The robust young man examined Lo Tian critically.

The black-clad youth also scrutinized him, his cold eyes showing a hint of kindness that surprised Lo Tian.

“Uh… what brings you two here? I am Elder Shitai Ping of Feiyunmen. Please don’t obstruct our affairs!” The Feiyunmen elder interrupted the robust youth, who was talking incessantly.

“Get out!” The robust youth, annoyed by the interruption, coldly said.

With a wave of his hand, the standing Feiyunmen elder was sent flying again.

“You!” The Feiyunmen elder, used to his authority, couldn’t bear such treatment. He could only sigh in frustration as the robust youth conversed with Lo Tian.

“Who are you?” Lo Tian asked the robust youth curiously.

“Oh, I forgot to introduce myself! We are your seniors. I am Lei Yong, and this cold-faced one is Ji Chen. I’m your Second Senior Brother, and he’s your Third Senior Brother,” Lei Yong said with a laugh.

“Senior… senior brother?” Lo Tian was thoroughly confused. When did he have seniors?

Gu Yun, hearing this, finally relaxed and walked up to the three with support from a Gu family disciple.

“Lo Tian, yes, you do have a master. He just hasn’t appeared yet. I took you in at his request!”

Lo Tian was still confused but understood that he had been taken as a disciple without knowing it.

He sighed in frustration: “What kind of situation is this?”

“Oh, it’s complicated. The old man said he has something to do and can’t come out now. You’ll be able to ask him when you reach Wuxingmen!” Lei Yong waved impatiently.

Lei Yong’s voice was not loud, but everyone heard it clearly. When they heard “Wuxingmen,” they looked at Lei Yong and Ji Chen with respect.

The Feiyunmen elder nearly collapsed, while Li Xiuping’s calm demeanor changed quickly. No one knew what he was thinking.

Chapter 16 - Departure

People were shocked. If Feiyunmen ruled Tianyuan City and nearby cities, Wuxingmen was the dominant force in northern Tianyuan Continent. Only a few sects could rival them, and Feiyunmen would be severely weakened if Wuxingmen took a breath.

If these two young men killed them and left their bodies at Feiyunmen’s gate, saying “I killed your elders,” the sect master wouldn’t even react.

“Are you two from Wuxingmen?” The Feiyunmen elder couldn’t help but ask.

“Junior brother, is it these scoundrels who want to kill you?” Lei Yong turned and pointed at Shi Taiping and Li Xiuping.

“Yes,” Lo Tian nodded, secretly relieved that his life was saved.
