Lu Tian followed the sound and saw a young man in brocade robes addressing a mother and daughter, both dressed in tattered clothes: “Xiao Yu, if you agree to be my twelfth concubine, Li Xiuran, I promise to cure your mother immediately!”

Lu Tian felt a wave of disgust as he looked at the young man in brocade robes. His eyes turned icy when they fell on the two guards flanking him, who were the same men that had forced Lu Tian into the freezing pool.

“I was planning to keep a low profile and focus on my cultivation, but since you have come looking for trouble, I will not hesitate to settle accounts with you!” Resolved, Lu Tian stepped out of the crowd and approached Li Xiuran.

Chapter Three: A Taste of His Abilities

Seeing Li Xiuran’s vile face, Lu Tian couldn’t help but sneer. He thought to himself that there was not a single decent person in the Li family.

Then, Lu Tian noticed two guards behind Li Xiuran. These were the same men who had forced him into the Wanyoutan, and Lu Tian could never forget the disgusting smile of the fat guard.

“I was planning to keep a low profile and focus on my cultivation, but since you have come looking for trouble, I will not hesitate to settle accounts with you!” Resolved, Lu Tian stepped out of the crowd and said mockingly to Li Xiuran: “Are all members of your family so shameless?”

Li Xiuran was clearly taken aback when he saw Lu Tian, obviously not expecting anyone in the city to dare interfere with his affairs.

“Do you want to die? How dare you meddle in my business!” Li Xiuran reached out to push Lu Tian.

Lu Tian dodged his hand and tripped him, causing Li Xiuran to fall to the ground.

Li Xiuran, accustomed to bullying others, had never experienced such a loss. He immediately called out to his guards: “Why aren’t you acting? I want him to suffer!”

The two guards finally recognized Lu Tian, their faces showing disbelief: “It’s you! You’re still alive!”

They could hardly believe their eyes. A man with severed meridians, who had fallen into the legendary Wanyoutan where ten out of ten died, was not only alive but standing there unharmed.

Lu Tian laughed coldly at their surprise: “Surprised to see me alive?”

“Even if you are alive, what can you do? You’re still a useless cripple!” The fat guard leered. “I’m glad you survived, it makes my revenge complete!”

“Die!” Lu Tian sneered at the fat guard’s disgusting gaze.

A fist wrapped in golden energy struck the fat guard’s dantian, destroying his cultivation base with astonishing speed.

In reality, their difference was not so great. The fat guard had underestimated Lu Tian because he believed him to be a cripple, and the speed of his golden energy was astonishing. Before the fat guard could react, he had been defeated.

Lu Tian stepped on the fat guard’s tool and asked coldly: “If I am a cripple, what are you? A disgusting thing!”

The fat guard, used to bullying others with the Li family’s power, fainted from shock after his cultivation was destroyed and he suffered a severe injury.

“Useless! Truly useless! Get up, kill this brat!” Li Xiuran tightened his legs in fear and ordered the thin guard to attack Lu Tian.

After seeing the speed of Lu Tian’s punch, the thin guard knew he was no match. However, with Li Xiuran’s order, he had to move forward and asked nervously: “Your meridians have recovered completely? Even your strength has reached the second level of Body Refinement. Could it be due to the Wanyoutan?”

“Congratulations, you guessed right! As a reward, I will let you suffer!” Lu Tian quoted the thin guard’s words and rushed forward with a punch.

“This is your death!” The thin guard was not alarmed but delighted. He believed that with a full-power attack, he could easily defeat Lu Tian.

The thin guard also attacked with all his might. However, he miscalculated as Lu Tian was not a mere gold energy cultivator but one with five elemental energies. His body, reinforced by these energies, was far stronger than a cultivator of the same level.

A muffled sound echoed as the thin guard’s arm broke. Lu Tian followed up with another punch, destroying his dantian.

Seeing the two defeated guards, everyone gasped in shock at Lu Tian’s strength and boldness. No one had ever dared to confront the Li family, but Lu Tian had crippled two of their guards.

Even more shocking was that after defeating the guards, Lu Tian turned towards Li Xiuran.

“Impossible! Does he really want to confront Li Xiuran? He is a direct descendant of the Li family. If something happens, the entire city will be thrown into chaos!” The onlookers whispered excitedly.

“What do you want?” Li Xiuran felt a chill and wanted to run.

“Even if you dare, the Li family will make your life unbearable!” Li Xiuran threatened.

“I’ll show you what I can do! Let’s see how the Li family will deal with me!” Lu Tian sneered. He and Li Xiuran were already enemies, so he could not let this opportunity pass.

Ignoring the threat, Lu Tian was prepared to cripple Li Xiuran and then hide until he had enough strength.

Seeing Lu Tian’s determination, Li Xiuran panicked and ran away.

“Too late! Today I will cripple you. The Li family, I will deal with them later.” Lu Tian pursued him.

Before he could act, a middle-aged man appeared and blocked his path. Without hesitation, the man attacked Lu Tian.

Lu Tian barely managed to block the attack and was pushed back several steps.

“Fourth level Body Refinement!” Lu Tian’s eyes darkened.

At the second level, he was almost invincible. He could勉强 fight a third-level cultivator and escape if necessary.

But facing a fourth-level cultivator, he had no chance of victory or even escape.

“Second Uncle, this brat dared to attack me. Capture him and make his life a living hell!” Li Xiuran, now emboldened by the middle-aged man’s presence, shouted.

“Who do you think you are? A mere second-level Body Refiner daring to challenge the Li family?” The middle-aged man attacked Lu Tian.

“Why do you attack without asking for reasons?” Lu Tian blocked the attack but was shaken, his energy almost scattered.

“Even able to block my full power, you are indeed arrogant. But no matter how talented you are, offending the Li family means death!” The middle-aged man’s aura surged.

Just then, a rough voice interrupted: “Li Yuande, do you really think this city belongs to the Li family?”

Chapter Four: Gǔ Yún

“Li Yuande, do you really think this city belongs to the Li family?” A middle-aged man stepped forward and blocked Li Yuande.

Li Yuande looked at the newcomer with a serious expression: “Gǔ Yún!”

“Gǔ Yún, take your family and leave! Young friend, you must not act!” Gǔ Yún said calmly but firmly.

Everyone was stunned by Gǔ Yún’s words. They couldn’t believe that the head of one of the three great families, Gǔ Yún, would protect a poor young man.

Lu Tian was also puzzled. He wondered what connection he had with Gǔ Yún.

“Gǔ Yún, I don’t know why you are protecting this brat, but are you really willing to oppose the Li family for him?” Li Yuande asked coldly.

“Am I afraid of you, Li? Let me tell you, I will protect this young friend!” Gǔ Yún retorted.

“You!” Li Yuande’s face turned red, but he knew he was no match for Gǔ Yún. He hesitated.

Li Yuande then said with a mocking tone: “Gǔ Yún, are you protecting him because he is your illegitimate son?”

“Die!” Gǔ Yún’s face darkened, his aura surging. His fifth-level Body Refinement energy formed a red palm and struck Li Yuande.

Li Yuande was stunned, realizing his mistake. He tried to dodge but found himself unable to move.

“Mind Art!” Li Yuande shouted as Gǔ Yún’s palm hit his chest. He was thrown back, spewing blood.

“Even your brother cannot protect you if I hear another word!” Gǔ Yún’s voice was cold and domineering.

Li Yuande struggled to his feet, glaring at Gǔ Yún: “Gǔ Yún, we will remember this! You, young man, offending the Li family means endless pursuit!”

Li Yuande wiped his mouth and left.

Seeing Li Yuande’s defeat, Li Xiuran fled without a word.

Lu Tian sighed in relief. He blamed himself for his rashness. A fourth-level Body Refiner was too powerful, and he might not have survived without Gǔ Yún’s intervention.

Lu Tian bowed to Gǔ Yún: “Junior Lu Tian, thank you for your help!”

Gǔ Yún smiled and said: “Young friend, not only are you talented but also brave. Would you consider joining our Gǔ family? I guarantee the Li family will not dare to harm you.”

Lu Tian was stunned. He wondered if Gǔ Yún admired his talent, but it seemed too enthusiastic.

Lu Tian hesitated while others envied him. Being invited by the head of a great family was a huge honor.

Lu Tian considered joining the Gǔ family. His identity had been exposed, and he could not handle the Li family alone.

Lu Tian bowed deeply: “I will join!”

As they were leaving, Lu Tian noticed the mother and daughter. He asked Gǔ Yún to take care of them.

Gǔ Yún agreed, patting Lu Tian’s shoulder. They walked towards the Gǔ family compound under envious glances.

The Gǔ family’s residence was impressive, though not as grand as the Feiyunmen. Lu Tian admired it.

Gǔ Yún led him into the main hall and called for an elder: “Uncle Tian, gather everyone in the hall. I have something to announce.”

The elder left.

Soon, the Gǔ family gathered in the hall. Leading them was a young girl of ten, with high-piled hair and a green dress. She carried a sword.

Behind her was a round-faced young man, who kept looking at Lu Tian.

Gǔ Yún announced: “From today, this young man, Lu Tian, will be our chief guest.”

The announcement caused a stir. The Gǔ family’s guests were usually powerful, and it was surprising to appoint a second-level Body Refiner as chief guest.

An elder suggested: “Please consider, we don’t know his background.”

Gǔ Yún said: “I have made my decision. Respect Lu Tian, or face my displeasure.”

Chapter Five: Dragon Tiger Body Refinement Pill

Gǔ Yún’s decision puzzled the family, but no one dared to question him.

After arranging Lu Tian’s accommodation, Gǔ Yún said: “I almost forgot. Here is a gift.”

He handed Lu Tian a jade bottle.

Lu Tian opened it, and the fragrance filled the room. Everyone stopped.

“Dragon Tiger Body Refinement Pill!” The round-faced young man exclaimed, drawing everyone’s attention to the bottle.

The young man was Gǔ Lei, Gǔ Yún’s son. The Dragon Tiger Body Refinement Pill was a rare second-grade pill, equivalent to a third-grade one.
