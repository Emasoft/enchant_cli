# Test Coverage Analysis

## Modules Without Test Files

Based on the analysis, the following modules in `src/enchant_book_manager/` do not have corresponding test files:

1. **__init__.py** - Package initialization file (usually doesn't need tests)
2. **epub_builder.py** - EPUB building functionality
3. **epub_generator.py** - EPUB generation logic
4. **main.py** - Main entry point
5. **make_epub.py** - EPUB creation from text files
6. **rename_file_processor.py** - File renaming processing
7. **renamenovels.py** - Novel renaming functionality
8. **text_processing.py** - Text processing utilities
9. **workflow_epub.py** - EPUB workflow implementation
10. **workflow_orchestrator.py** - Workflow orchestration logic
11. **workflow_phases.py** - Workflow phase definitions
12. **workflow_progress.py** - Workflow progress tracking

## Priority for Test Creation

Based on the importance and complexity of these modules, here's the recommended priority:

### High Priority (Core Functionality)
1. **workflow_orchestrator.py** - Central orchestration logic
2. **translation_orchestrator.py** - Already has tests but needs more coverage
3. **make_epub.py** - Core EPUB creation functionality
4. **renamenovels.py** - Core renaming functionality

### Medium Priority (Supporting Modules)
5. **epub_generator.py** - EPUB generation logic
6. **epub_builder.py** - EPUB building functionality
7. **workflow_phases.py** - Workflow phase definitions
8. **text_processing.py** - Text processing utilities

### Low Priority
9. **rename_file_processor.py** - File processing logic
10. **workflow_epub.py** - EPUB workflow specifics
11. **workflow_progress.py** - Progress tracking
12. **main.py** - Entry point (integration tests cover this)

## Existing Test Coverage

The project has extensive test coverage for many modules including:
- API clients
- Batch processing
- Chapter detection and parsing
- Configuration management
- Cost tracking
- Translation services
- Common utilities

## Recommendations

1. **Start with high-priority modules** - Focus on core functionality first
2. **Aim for 80%+ coverage** - For each new test file created
3. **Include edge cases** - Test error conditions and edge cases
4. **Use existing test patterns** - Follow the patterns established in existing tests
5. **Integration tests** - Some modules may be better tested through integration tests

## Next Steps

To improve overall test coverage:
1. Create test files for the high-priority modules first
2. Run coverage reports after each new test file to track progress
3. Focus on testing public APIs and critical paths
4. Consider which modules might be better tested through integration tests
