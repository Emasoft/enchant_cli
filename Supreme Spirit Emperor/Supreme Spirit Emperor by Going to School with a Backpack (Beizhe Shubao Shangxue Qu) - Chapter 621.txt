“Dan Yao!” Fu Xingyue did not hesitate, pulling out a handful of pills and prying Luo Tian’s mouth open to shove them inside.

“Weng……” After swallowing the pills, a wave of green light radiated from Luo Tian’s body. His entire form felt numb and tingling, as if every organ and sinew were being caressed by a soft current.

“His injuries are severe,” Luo Tian thought, but the pills had at least allowed him to open his eyes. He gazed around at the pitch-black depths of the ocean.

“Chala la……” As Luo Tian pondered, a series of splashing sounds echoed through the water. Crimson blood stained the sea, and several figures surged toward him with astonishing speed.

“What is this?” Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue were stunned, staring at the figures approaching them with expressions of panic.

The beings had human upper bodies and fish-like lower halves. Their faces revealed they were three men and two women—handsome men, beautiful women. Their attire was minimal, with scales covering their most private areas.

Behind them stood more figures, but their upper halves were fish while their lower halves were human. Their sharp teeth gleamed with cold light, chasing the merfolk ahead of them.

“Sea demons!” Luo Tian’s mind surged with shock. He signaled Fu Xingyue to be cautious, for this was the domain of the sea demons. They had no prior connection with the merfolk clan and simply wished to return safely.

“Humans, save us!” The merfolk surged toward Luo Tian’s group, their tails marred by wounds and scales missing—clear signs of being hunted. Their strength was modest, no more than early True Immortal level, which eased Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue’s nerves.

“Humans!” The sea demons behind the merfolk blinked in surprise, but their eyes flashed with hostility.

“Hai Sha Clan! Merfolk!” Luo Tian instantly recalled the records of the Hai Sha Clan from Butian Mountain.

The merfolk were a rare race in Huantian Sea, with human bodies and fish tails. Each was exquisitely beautiful and avoided conflict.

“Long has it been since we tasted human flesh!” The sea demons’ eyes gleamed with cruelty, their gazes filled with greed. Especially drawn to the blood seeping from Luo Tian’s wounds, their hostility deepened.

“Save us!” A mermaid girl swam toward Fu Xingyue, her eyes pleading.

“Don’t worry—my presence ensures your safety!” Fu Xingyue’s lecherous tendencies resurfaced, promising protection. Facing the dozen or so Sea Shark Clan elites, whose highest rank was late True Immortal, Fu Xingyue felt confident enough to defeat them.

“…”

“Big brother, I’m still injured. Are you really going to flirt with them now? This lot doesn’t look friendly!” Luo Tian rolled his eyes at Fu Xingyue, but he was powerless to act. Everything relied on Fu Xingyue; even with the pills, Luo Tian could only barely stay alive.

“Hao……” As they spoke, several Sea Shark Clan elites lunged toward Luo Tian’s group. They wielded weapons forged from fish bones, their appearance fearsome.

“Damn it, since entering the Immortal realm I’ve been bullied! Now these damned fish dare to bully me!” Fu Xingyue cursed, his injuries only partially healed. Yet he faced the Sea Shark Clan without fear, brandishing his Star Moon Divine Halberd and charging forward.

Fu Xingyue’s pent-up anger left no room for mercy. With a single strike, he felled the Sea Shark Clan members in quick succession, their bodies reduced to blood mist. The crimson droplets stained the surroundings.

“Benefactor, flee!” A mermaid woman approached Fu Xingyue, grabbing his arm and pulling him toward the distance. The remaining merfolk carried Luo Tian behind her.

The merfolk swam through the ocean, and after about half an hour, they led Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue into a dark fissure.

The fissure seemed unremarkable, its depths obscured. Yet as they crossed it, the world around them shifted dramatically.

The water was crystal clear, with merfolk gliding through it. At the center of this boundless sea stood a golden palace, astonishing Luo Tian—this place felt like another world. Some areas were even untouched by Huantian Sea.

“This is our merfolk clan’s territory, benefactor. Follow me!” The woman who had held Fu Xingyue’s hand—Shui Yunqian—led them toward the palace.

“Huh…” After an hour, Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue landed on the palace floor, feeling much more comfortable. Especially Luo Tian, who had been submerged in water for so long; now he felt refreshed. The merfolk entering the palace grew legs, though their private areas remained covered in scales. Even so, Fu Xingyue was dazzled.

“Qian’er, my friend is severely injured. Could you arrange a place for me to heal him?” Fu Xingyue, a seasoned flirt, handled the situation effortlessly.

“You could stay at my home!” Shui Yunqian blushed, nodding and leading Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue into the palace.

The palace was immense, filled with merfolk. Shui Yunqian, who had led Fu Xingyue, clearly held a high status.

“Princess!” A merfolk bowed respectfully to Shui Yunqian.

“Princess…” Luo Tian mused, surprised Fu Xingyue had saved a princess. The entire palace resembled a vast city, with structures made of colorful crystals. After an hour of walking, they reached the largest palace at its center.

They were not stopped. The woman led Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue into the palace, where a stern figure sat. Upon her entrance, the middle-aged man sighed deeply.

Chapter 2343: None of My Business

“Xiao Qian, what’s wrong? Where did you go?” The middle-aged man barked, scolding her but with a gentle gaze.

“Father, I was searching for a gift for Grandpa’s birthday!” The girl named Xiao Qian blushed, pulling her hand from Fu Xingyue’s grasp and stepping toward the man.

“Human?” The middle-aged man scrutinized Fu Xingyue and Luo Tian with a critical gaze.

“Respected elder, we mean no harm. My friend was injured and stranded here, and Xiao Qian rescued us from being hunted. She invited us here,” Fu Xingyue spoke respectfully, as Luo Tian could not speak.

The middle-aged man’s aura made Fu Xingyue hesitate, but he recognized it as early Immortal King level. Even Luo Tian, a prodigy, had nearly fallen to an Immortal King.

“Father, you don’t know—those Sea Shark Clan members are ruthless!” Xiao Qian interjected, recounting the events to her father. She portrayed Fu Xingyue as a hero, her eyes glowing with admiration for him. Anyone could see she had taken a liking to Fu Xingyue.

After all, Fu Xingyue’s appearance was striking—members of the Star Moon Clan were all handsome. As a prince, his aura was irresistible to women. In the Nine Domains of Star Moon Clan, Fu Xingyue had many wives. Though Luo Tian hadn’t deeply interacted with the people of Starry Domain, he could guess Fu Xingyue had married many women through his charm. Now he was courting a merfolk princess, which made Luo Tian uneasy. If they angered the merfolk king, his current state wouldn’t withstand it.

“Hmph. I am Shui Li, the merfolk clan’s leader. Thank you for saving my daughter, Shui Yunqian!” The middle-aged man softened after hearing Fu Xingyue and his daughter’s words.

“However, our merfolk clan avoids conflict. We don’t wish to interact with humans. You may stay a few days, and after your friend recovers, you can leave,” Shui Li spoke coldly, making his intent clear.

“Father, you can’t do this! They saved my life!” Shui Yunqian’s face darkened, shouting. To her, Fu Xingyue was her savior and should stay as long as she wished.

“Xiao Qian, humans are all cunning. Perhaps these two have ulterior motives. I find this one suspicious and not trustworthy!” As Shui Yunqian spoke, a young man stepped forward, eyeing Fu Xingyue with hostility.

Shui Li pondered and addressed Fu Xingyue: “I will personally restore your friend’s injuries. After that, you must leave.”

“That is most kind. Thank you, elder!” Fu Xingyue glanced at the young man with disdain.

Fu Xingyue clearly saw the young man’s interest in Shui Yunqian, but his actions were poor—only making Shui Yunqian more repulsed.

Luo Tian didn’t care about Fu Xingyue and the young man’s rivalry; he remembered Shui Li’s words. With his help, Luo Tian’s injuries would heal quickly—after all, an Immortal King could even mend a body with divine energy.

“Come with me,” Shui Li said softly, having Fu Xingyue carry Luo Tian into the inner palace.

“Thank you, elder,” Fu Xingyue said, not fearing Shui Li’s intentions but remaining in the room, wary of any hidden motives. After all, Luo Tian’s secrets were too many.

“Weng…” Shui Li began mending Luo Tian’s meridians and body with divine energy.

“Ah……” Luo Tian’s agonized cries echoed, making Fu Xingyue grimace. If he hadn’t seen it himself, he’d have thought Shui Li was harming Luo Tian.

“Have I been cursed recently? So unlucky!” Luo Tian mentally cursed, his misfortunes piling up.

Time passed slowly as Shui Li meticulously mended Luo Tian’s meridians, his eyes gradually showing fatigue. When the final eight ghostly meridians were reconnected, Luo Tian’s aura surged rapidly. The residual demonic energy in his meridians began to circulate, accumulating steadily.

“Which immortal mountain are you from?” Shui Li sighed, wiping sweat from his brow. The task had clearly been arduous.

Yet he was awestruck by Luo Tian’s meridians, especially the eight ghostly ones—far stronger than ordinary.

“I am from Butian Mountain!” Luo Tian, recovering slightly, weakly spoke but with a faint voice.

“Ah, I see. Who did you offend? If these meridians aren’t mended soon, they may become clogged. Fixing them would be very difficult!” Upon hearing Luo Tian was from Butian Mountain, Shui Li’s vigilance lessened.

“Rest here for a few days. With your constitution, three or five days should suffice to leave,” Shui Li spoke before Luo Tian could respond.

“Thank you, elder. If there’s anything I can do for you in the future, please let me know!” Luo Tian respectfully replied. Fu Xingyue bowed to Shui Li.

“No problem. You saved my daughter; one life for another, no debt,” Shui Li said nothing more and left the palace.

“Rest, we should leave as soon as possible. In water, our strength is weakened,” Luo Tian told Fu Xingyue.

“Hmph!” Fu Xingyue nodded, understanding the urgency. He sat cross-legged, guarding Luo Tian while recovering himself.

Time passed. The next day, Shui Yunqian stood outside their palace. Fu Xingyue smiled at Luo Tian, his eyes gleaming with pride.

“Go away!” Luo Tian glared at Fu Xingyue, having recovered one-tenth of his strength. He estimated another three days would restore eight-tenths, allowing them to leave.

“I did this for us! I sacrificed myself!” Fu Xingyue laughed, stepping out of the palace.

Luo Tian sat again, continuing his recovery. The Mind Demon Cultivation Classic cycled through his mind, and his healing accelerated.

One day, two days—two more passed. Luo Tian had recovered six-tenths of his strength. During these two days, Fu Xingyue only returned occasionally to check on Luo Tian’s condition. Each time he returned, his face was radiant—clearly, his relationship with Shui Yunqian had progressed swiftly.

On the third morning, as Luo Tian stretched in the palace, a cacophony of curses echoed outside.

“That bastard! He’s seduced so many of us! With the princess supporting him, we can’t beat him. But we can beat his friend!”

“Exactly! That pretty boy has no good intentions. Long ago, Elder Dragon said he was suspicious. Now it’s clear!” Figures appeared outside Luo Tian’s palace, their eyes filled with anger.

“…” Luo Tian was speechless, feeling Fu Xingyue had planned this. He’d endured similar treatment in the Star Moon Clan before; now, Fu Xingyue’s mistake had made him suffer.

“Come out, you sickly wretch!” The crowd shouted, having learned Luo Tian had nearly died upon arrival. Though aided by the merfolk clan leader, he hadn’t recovered so quickly—so they felt safe to bully him.

“Sigh…” Luo Tian sighed, though it was Fu Xingyue’s trouble, he couldn’t ignore it. His strength had recovered seven-tenths; he could now face these bullies.

“Have you come to fight me?” Luo Tian coldly stepped out of the palace, his gaze sharp and eyes filled with icy menace.

“Me?” These people, at most late True Immortal level, couldn’t withstand Luo Tian’s aura. Their eyes showed fear as they stared at him.

“Waste!” Luo Tian mentally cursed. These people were weak, avoiding Fu Xingyue and taking out their anger on this injured person. Though Luo Tian had slightly enhanced his aura, it wasn’t enough to make them so terrified.

In short, these people were envious and resorted to petty tricks, bullying soft targets to vent their anger. When faced with a strong opponent, they turned into cowards.

This was the merfolk clan’s territory; Shui Li had helped him. If not for that, Luo Tian wouldn’t mind teaching these cowards a lesson.

“Was it you who cursed me?” Luo Tian looked at one of the people, a late True Immortal youth.

The youth trembled as if struck by lightning, staring at Luo Tian with fear. To him, Luo Tian was a devil.

“Get out! What do you think you are, daring to cause trouble in our merfolk clan?” Luo Tian sneered, lowering his aura and walking back into the palace.

“Huh…” As Luo Tian’s aura receded, the merfolk people sighed in relief. All of them wiped sweat from their faces.

“You dare to cause trouble here?” A cold voice echoed outside the crowd, a figure pushing through.

Chapter 2344: Birthday Celebration

Unlike others, this newcomer was a youth in a pale blue robe. His blue eyes held arrogance as he stepped into the crowd, drawing attention.

“Long Elder!” Respectful voices echoed among the merfolk people, their faces lighting up as they looked at the youth.

This youth was the same one who had previously demanded Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue leave. His name was Bao Long, who had spoken directly to the merfolk clan leader—clearly holding a high position in the clan.

Luo Tian slowly turned, his brows furrowed slightly but he didn’t retaliate. He watched Bao Long approach him.

“Is there something you need?” Luo Tian asked again, confident he could subdue anyone not an Immortal King.

“Human! Our merfolk clan has sheltered you; the clan leader even personally healed you. Yet you show no gratitude, and now you oppress our merfolk! How bold of you!” Bao Long roared, his hand reaching toward Luo Tian.

“This excuse is truly rotten!” Luo Tian sighed, slapping out a palm to clash with Bao Long’s hand.

“Peng…” A dull sound echoed, and Bao Long was thrown back. Luo Tian stood unmoved.

“You…” Bao Long’s face showed shock. He was a prodigy of the merfolk clan, and the disciple of the clan leader. Though not much in Huantian Sea, Bao Long was confident no one in his vicinity could match him.

“What do you mean? If there’s something, say it. Otherwise, leave. I’ll be leaving tomorrow anyway; I don’t want to cause conflict with the merfolk clan!” Luo Tian spoke softly, turning back toward the palace.

“Long Elder, this one was going to enter the Huantian Sea Palace but got thrown out!” The merfolk people looked in disbelief. To them, Bao Long was undefeated among his peers.

“What’s going on?” As Bao Long’s face darkened, Fu Xingyue and Shui Yunqian rushed over. Fu Xingyue’s face showed guilt; these two days, he had been preoccupied with Shui Yunqian and neglected Luo Tian. If anything happened to him, Fu Xingyue would never forgive himself.

“Bao Elder, what are you doing?” Shui Yunqian’s face showed anger. Fu Xingyue had saved them, but Bao Long was attacking Luo Tian. With Luo Tian injured, Shui Yunqian felt guilty.

“Yunqian, these two are no good. This one just recovered and started oppressing our merfolk!” Bao Long glared at Shui Yunqian and Fu Xingyue, his eyes burning with anger.

“Rubbish! My friend was here to recover; why provoke a hundred people?” Fu Xingyue cursed, eyeing Bao Long with provocation. He stepped beside Shui Yunqian and held her hand.

“Yunqian, this isn’t your concern. We’re humans, and we’re not welcome here. Let it go,” Fu Xingyue spoke gently to Shui Yunqian, his eyes soft.

“Moon Brother, this is our fault. Don’t take it personally!” Shui Yunqian blushed but let Fu Xingyue hold her hand, her eyes filled with apology.

Seeing Fu Xingyue and Shui Yunqian being affectionate, even Luo Tian felt he couldn’t bear it. How much more so for Bao Long and the other merfolk disciples.

“Fu Xingyue, don’t spread lies to bewitch Yunqian!” Bao Long roared, his face red. His eyes glared at Fu Xingyue as if he wanted to devour him.

“Yunqian, this is too much! Moon Brother and Luo Brother are guests. Our merfolk clan has always avoided conflict, valuing peace. Why be so aggressive?” Shui Yunqian glared at Bao Long, her anger evident.

“Say it clearly—what do you want?” Luo Tian had no patience for words, his gaze on Bao Long.

“What? You two leave the merfolk clan immediately!” Bao Long spoke coldly, his eyes filled with anger.

“Stop! What are you doing? Go back! Tomorrow is a big day; don’t delay, or I won’t be responsible!” As Bao Long’s words ended, a furious voice echoed. Shui Li appeared with a dark face.

“Respect the clan leader!” The merfolk people immediately bowed, showing reverence.

“You two stay here and leave after two days!” Shui Li said nothing more, addressing Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue directly before leaving the palace.

“Thank you,” Luo Tian bowed to Shui Li, his eyes filled with gratitude.

“You’re lucky!” Bao Long sneered, leading the merfolk people away.

“Yunqian, go ahead and take care of your grandfather’s birthday; you must be busy!” Fu Xingyue smiled, addressing Shui Yunqian.

“Hmph, Moon Brother, rest well!” Shui Yunqian nodded and left the hall.

Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue entered their previous palace. As soon as they stepped in, Luo Tian glared at Fu Xingyue.

“Tell me, what were you doing? Why target the merfolk princess? If a conflict arose, we wouldn’t have come out well!” Luo Tian scolded, making Fu Xingyue blush.

“That’s just a habit… I mean, we’ll leave tomorrow anyway!” Fu Xingyue awkwardly replied.

“Hmph, I hope it goes smoothly,” Luo Tian nodded. He felt Bao Long was a petty person; staying here might cause trouble.

But Luo Tian didn’t want to spoil Fu Xingyue’s mood. He knew Fu Xingyue had truly fallen for Shui Yunqian.

The night passed without incident. On the next day, the entire merfolk clan became lively. Figures emerged from the surrounding sea, strange and varied, gathering in the massive palace. These people had come to celebrate Shui Yunqian’s grandfather—Shui Li’s father, the merfolk clan’s elder leader, Shui Changkong.

An Immortal King in the middle stage—just this rank alone was admirable. This day was Shui Changkong’s 10,000-year birthday. The merfolk clan, spanning millions of miles, had many factions coming to congratulate him.

The entire Huantian Sea was ruled by a place called Huantian Sea Palace, but the sea was vast. Many races ignored its rule, establishing their own strongholds. The Huantian Sea Palace’s reach couldn’t fully unify all forces in the sea.

The merfolk clan was also under Huantian Sea Palace’s jurisdiction, but within millions of miles, no one dared defy Shui Changkong.

One reason was the merfolk clan’s gentleness, avoiding conflict; another was their strength. Though few in number, Shui Changkong was a genuine Immortal King in the middle stage.

The grand palace buzzed with activity. There were at least seven Immortal King early-stage figures, and many True Immortal-level warriors.

In a grand hall filled with people, besides the merfolk clan’s elites greeting guests, many others sat.

“Haha, welcome to my birthday!” An old man sat at the top seat, with Shui Li standing beside him, his face respectful.

The old man had white hair and wore a festive red robe, smiling warmly.

“Long live Grandfather Shui Changkong!” Various leaders of factions in Huantian Sea shouted.

“Grandfather, this is my gift for you!” Shui Yunqian smiled, stepping forward and waving her hand. A pearl the size of a fist appeared in her palm, radiating radiant light.

“Huantian Pearl!” The pearl’s appearance caused a stir among the crowd, their eyes filled with surprise as they gazed at Shui Yunqian.

“This Huantian Pearl appears once every ten thousand years. The Huantian Shell that produces it is also rare in the Huantian Sea!” Someone spoke.

“Haha, my dear granddaughter!” Shui Changkong laughed heartily, his face lines deepening. He took the pearl into his hands, cherishing it.

“Grandfather, this is our gift for you…” The merfolk clan’s others also presented gifts, making Shui Changkong laugh constantly. Though not as precious as the Huantian Pearl, they were all heartfelt.

“Master Shui, we heard your merfolk clan has two humans. Could we see them?” A playful voice echoed as people paused slightly.

Hearing this, Shui Li’s brows furrowed, his gaze filled with confusion toward the speaker. Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue’s news had already been ordered not to be spread, as many factions in Huantian Sea were hostile toward humans.

“Humans!” Upon hearing this, several faction members’ eyes flashed with anger.

“Please let Master Shui bring those two humans out so we can see them!” The faction members urged Shui Changkong.

“Is that true?”

“Shui Li, bring the humans out!” Shui Changkong spoke carelessly. In his mind, the two were likely captured by Shui Li’s people.

“This time I’ll see if you die or not! The Silver Crab Clan and the Water Shrimp Clan both hate humans!” Bao Long’s face showed a smile, watching the faction members’ anger. The information was his doing.

“Yes!” Shui Li bowed, complying with Shui Changkong’s order. He knew among the birthday guests were many factions that hated humans, so he had kept Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue hidden to avoid them meeting. He planned for them to leave tomorrow.

Shui Li left the hall but sent a mental message to Shui Changkong about Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue’s situation, causing Shui Changkong to frown slightly.

At this moment, Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue sat in their palace. Luo Tian’s injuries had recovered nine-tenths, no longer a problem.

Chapter 2345: Cruelty

Shui Li visited Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue’s palace, his brows furrowed. The two were startled; as the merfolk clan leader, he would have to be busy for his father’s birthday. It was unlikely he’d come here without reason.

“Come with me,” Shui Li spoke softly, his tone serious. The two felt trouble was coming.

“Let’s go,” Luo Tian said to Fu Xingyue. Now that he had strength, he felt more secure. Even if not an Immortal King late-stage opponent, they could escape using Butian Stone.

They followed Shui Li to the grand hall where many sea creatures were gathered.

“Tsk tsk, so many seafood…” Fu Xingyue mentally transmitted to Luo Tian, gazing at the creatures in the hall.

“If Zhan Biao were here, he’d be drooling…” Luo Tian heard Fu Xingyue’s words. He saw the old man at the top seat—Shui Changkong, an Immortal King middle-stage. He felt reassured and smiled, thinking of Chen Zhanbiao, the glutton.

“Father, they’re here!” Shui Li bowed to Shui Changkong. The sight of Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue instantly caused some people to glare at them with anger, while others remained indifferent.

“Master Shui, hand over these two humans to us. Our people have been captured and eaten by humans; this grudge is deeper than the Huantian Sea!” A half-Immortal King shrimp-headed sea demon roared.

“Indeed, our Silver Crab Clan loses many members daily!” A crab-headed sea demon also shouted. If not for Shui Changkong, they might have already attacked.

Luo Tian’s heart tightened; he hadn’t expected them to hate him so much. He scanned the crowd, spotting Bao Long with a triumphant look—realizing who was behind this.

“Damn it!” Fu Xingyue wasn’t a fool and understood who was behind this. His eyes glared at Bao Long.

“Everyone, calm down. The sea demons of Huantian Sea have an agreement with the Nine Immortal Mountains not to harm their disciples. These two are from the Nine Immortal Mountains; we merfolk clan, under Huantian Sea Palace’s jurisdiction, must abide by its rules!”

“Moreover, these two saved my precious granddaughter. Please grant me a favor and let them go!” Shui Changkong spoke softly, pleading for Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue.

Hearing Shui Changkong’s words, most people calmed down. No one in millions of miles dared defy Shui Changkong’s authority.

“Since Master Shui spoke, we won’t say anything. But the death penalty is forgivable; let’s take their legs to honor our fallen!” A sea demon spoke, gazing at Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue.

“Do you have that ability?” Fu Xingyue coldly replied, his Star Moon Divine Halberd in hand.

“Weng…” Luo Tian also took out Longyuan Sword, gazing at the sea demons. They hadn’t attacked them before; instead, they had saved Shui Yunqian. Yet these people targeted them constantly. Even a mud man would have anger, let alone Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue.

“If they attack, we’ll fight back and escape!” Luo Tian’s eyes hardened; he wouldn’t let them take his legs without reason.

“Everyone, stay calm! Don’t make me regret it!” Shui Changkong spoke loudly, his aura descending. His gaze swept over the crowd, silencing them instantly.

“Today is my birthday; I don’t want bloodshed. If anyone makes me unhappy, I’ll make them unhappy too!” Shui Changkong spoke softly, his voice carrying authority.

The hall fell silent. Yet Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue stood there, gazing at the people. If they fought, as long as Shui Changkong didn’t personally intervene, Luo Tian had confidence in escaping safely.

“Haha, Shui Changkong, I’m here to make you unhappy! What can you do?” As people just calmed down, a long laugh echoed outside the palace.

“Chala la…” The sea around the merfolk clan’s territory violently stirred, and figures like swords surged from the water. A massive blue hand shook, striking the merfolk clan’s territory.

“Boom…” Like an earthquake, the entire merfolk clan’s territory trembled. Crystalline palaces cracked.

A piercing roar echoed as figures surged from the sea, making Shui Changkong’s face darken.

“Sea Shark Clan!” Shui Changkong’s expression turned grim, his body flickering to appear outside the palace.

Others also exited the palace, seeing the dense Sea Shark Clan members, their eyes filled with fear.

“White Shark, this is our merfolk clan’s territory. What do you want?” Shui Changkong furrowed his brows, gazing at the Sea Shark Clan’s leader.

“Nothing special. A few days ago, your merfolk clan sent some people to our place and stole our tribe’s treasure—the Sea Shark Sword. I’m here for an explanation!” The old man called White Shark sneered.

“Nonsense! We’ve never trespassed or fought with water, and our merfolk clan avoids conflict. How could we steal your Sea Shark Sword?” Shui Changkong sneered, while secretly sending a mental message to Shui Li. He knew the Sea Shark Clan’s visit was no good.

“It was that girl, your granddaughter. Hand her over to me and make her a furnace. Every month, send us one hundred merfolk beauties. Otherwise, today is your clan’s day of annihilation. Every year on this day will be your mourning!” White Shark spoke, his voice threatening.

“Impossible! White Shark, your Sea Shark Clan is strong, but our merfolk clan isn’t easy to bully!” Shui Changkong was also fierce, his eyes filled with anger.

“Good! My people, attack! Take prisoners and slaves as you wish!” White Shark didn’t speak further. He flew forward, charging at Shui Changkong.

“Crack…” Next moment, the Sea Shark Clan members surged toward the merfolk clan’s gathered people.

“Sea Shark Clan business! Don’t want to die? Get out!” White Shark laughed, his eyes fierce. His shark-bone sword gleamed like sharp teeth, slicing at Shui Changkong.

“Boom…” The other faction leaders who had come to congratulate immediately scattered. They were small factions, and while the merfolk clan ruled millions of miles, the Sea Shark Clan was also powerful, even surpassing the merfolk. Moreover, the Sea Shark Clan members were ruthless and fierce in battle.

“How could they start fighting so suddenly!” Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue’s faces changed. They hadn’t expected the two clans to fight so quickly.

“Should we get involved?” Fu Xingyue looked at Luo Tian, gazing at the chaotic merfolk clan’s territory.

It was sudden—no one expected the Sea Shark Clan to attack so ruthlessly without warning, and with such ferocity.

In an instant, the merfolk clan was slaughtered in large numbers, and the scene turned chaotic.

The merfolk clan immediately fell into a disadvantage, as the Sea Shark Clan was naturally fierce and aggressive.

“Of course we should get involved! Didn’t you see your precious princess fight?” Luo Tian’s lips twitched, flying forward to attack a half-Immortal King Sea Shark Clan member.

“Human?” The Sea Shark Clan member saw Luo Tian approaching, his eyes gleamed with greed. He licked his lips lightly.
