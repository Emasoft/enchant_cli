The youth's face bore an expression of sorrow, his eyes somewhat vacant yet filled with hesitation and a trace of fear. This young man was Luo Tian.

Beneath the sorrowful atmosphere, Luo Tian arrived at Feiyun Sect's mountain gate. At this moment, most of Feiyun Sect's disciples had already departed back into the sect's inner sanctum, though some remained repairing the walls and the damage from yesterday.

"Luotian!" Some disciples shouted as they saw the youth approach the gate.

"Luotian! What business do you have here!" People stared in disbelief at the youth whose face was somewhat hollow, recalling his terrifying actions from yesterday. Some disciples felt fear within their hearts.

Yet some disciples still harbored resentment, for their friends had perished in yesterday's battle.

Regardless of their hatred towards Luo Tian, none dared to strike. Their resentment was great, but they feared even more the formidable figure before them, a man akin to a demon.

As their voices echoed, more disciples from Feiyun Sect emerged from the mountain gate. Two elders at the early stage of bone-destroying cultivation also joined the crowd.

Including these two elders, all Feiyun Sect members regarded Luo Tian with a sense of impending danger.

"Luotian! Why have you returned to Feiyun Sect?" A voice, somewhat feeble, rang out as the sect's disciplinary elder Yu Pengfei appeared in their sight.

"Disciple of Wuxing Sect's Dan Pavilion, Luotian, has come to pay respects to Feiyun Sect's Lan Yuting!" Luo Tian's voice carried a touch of nostalgia, his face displaying a gentle expression.

Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Feiyun Sect disciples looked at him in surprise before their gazes softened with sympathy.

Having heard of the events between Lan Yuting and Luo Tian, these disciples naturally felt sorrow for the two. They pitied this heart-wrenching woman.

Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Yu Pengfei's expression slightly softened. However, he soon displayed a troubled look. Given Luo Tian's current relationship with Feiyun Sect, it was indeed unsuitable for him to enter the sect.

It wasn't that they feared Luo Tian, but Yu Pengfei dared not guarantee that the enraged disciples would refrain from attacking Luo Tian. If something were to happen to Luo Tian, Feiyun Sect would not merely lose a thousand lives but would also sacrifice the entire sect.

"Luo Tian, disciple of Wuxing Sect's Dan Pavilion, humbly requests to pay respects to Feiyun Sect's Lan Yuting!" Luo Tian ignored Yu Pengfei's troubled expression and continued speaking calmly. This single voice resonated throughout Wuxing Sect via the mind.

"Luotian! Luotian has returned again. How audacious! He's overstepping!" Roars of anger echoed from various courtyards within Feiyun Sect.

Numerous figures emerged from the mountain gate, all glaring at Luo Tian. Clearly, if someone led the charge, a fight would ensue. However, due to Luo Tian's strength, no one dared to take the lead.

As people glared at Luo Tian, a weathered voice rang out: "Permit it. Feiyun Sect disciples must not attack him. Once he finishes his tribute, let him leave Feiyun Sect immediately!"

Upon hearing this voice, the disciples of Feiyun Sect trembled. Even Yu Pengfei exhaled a sigh of relief.

"Protect Luo Tian, for I fear some disciples may not restrain themselves!" Nan Gongxiu's voice echoed in Yu Pengfei's ear.

Though Yu Pengfei had just relaxed, upon hearing Nan Gongxiu's whisper, his body trembled. He then let out a bitter smile, thinking: "Is this to protect Luo Tian or Feiyun Sect's disciples?"

Nan Gongxiu had spoken, so Yu Pengfei naturally allowed passage. He lowered his head to Luo Tian and said: "Come, I'll lead you."

After Yu Pengfei spoke, he turned and walked into Feiyun Sect. Luo Tian said nothing, following Yu Pengfei into the mountain gate under the angry gazes of Feiyun Sect disciples.

Luo Tian had spent three years in Feiyun Sect as a menial servant, becoming somewhat familiar with the sect. Now, gazing at this place that was both familiar and infinitely strange, his sorrow gradually eased, replaced by a sense of nostalgia for returning to a place long absent.

Not long after, under Yu Pengfei's guidance, they arrived at a low hill. On the hill stood a simple thatched hut with an elderly man seated on a rocking chair, basking in the sun.

Behind the thatched hut lay a series of towering tombs, starkly contrasting with the old man's leisurely demeanor.

"Master Siti, I have come under the Master's command to bring this youth here to pay respects to an inner sect disciple!" Yu Pengfei, upon seeing the old man, displayed deep reverence.

The old man heard Yu Pengfei's voice and slowly opened his eyes. His gaze was slightly hazy as he glanced at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian looked at the old man. Though the old man had only gazed at him once, this glance struck like a lightning bolt in the night, thundering within Luo Tian's mind. Instantly, fear filled his heart. This gaze carried an ancient wisdom and the ability to see through all things.

Luo Tian had encountered the most terrifying person before—his teacher's spirit. Yet this old man, though lacking any cultivation fluctuations, gave Luo Tian a feeling no less formidable than his teacher's spirit.

"Feiyun Sect is not as simple as it appears!" Sensing the old man's terrifying presence, Luo Tian slightly bowed in respect.

"Is this the little fellow who caused such a ruckus yesterday?" The old man, known as Siti, asked lazily.

The four disciples nearby, hearing the old man's question, felt joy. They had often heard their masters speak of this tomb guardian. One of them answered loudly: "Master, it was he who led the attack and slaughtered nearly a thousand disciples of Feiyun Sect!"

The old man seemed to ignore their words, merely opening his hazy eyes again and scrutinizing Luo Tian.

Chapter 112: Paying Respects

Chapter 112: Paying Respects

Luo Tian's entire focus was on observing the old man. When he saw the old man open his eyes again, a chill ran through him, as if returning to the forgotten depths of Wangyou Dam. His entire soul felt frozen.

"Kill intent!" Luo Tian sensed kill intent within the old man's gaze.

Luo Tian's body trembled involuntarily. A terrifying elder with kill intent towards him was no fun at all.

The two disciples who were the elders' direct disciples, upon witnessing this situation, felt joy. They hoped the old man would kill Luo Tian, even a harsh beating would suffice to vent their anger.

However, at this moment, the jade pendant on Luo Tian's waist, a gift from his master Zhang Daotian, emitted a soft green glow. This eased Luo Tian's cold body.

Master Siti noticed the jade pendant on Luo Tian's waist, his face flashing with a brief surprise before returning to his leisurely sunbathing.

"Enter. Don't wander about and disturb the peace of our ancestors. I'll hold you accountable!" The old man spoke lazily, continuing to bask in the sun.

"Yes!" Yu Pengfei respectfully replied and led Luo Tian into the cemetery. The other Feiyun Sect disciples remained outside, only a few direct disciples were allowed to enter the cemetery.

Luo Tian felt relieved and sensed his master's mystery deepened further.

Feiyun Sect's cemetery for the deceased was vast. Only elders and their direct disciples could be buried there, though those who made significant contributions to Feiyun Sect also received this honor.

Yu Pengfei led Luo Tian and others slowly through the cemetery, his face displaying solemnity and reverence. He clearly respected the deceased disciples and elders of Feiyun Sect.

Passing through numerous tombs, Yu Pengfei led them to a large tomb. This tomb was far larger than the others, requiring one to look up to see its full form. Next to it stood a stone statue of the same size as a person, lifelike and standing there.

"This is our Feiyun Sect's first sect leader. He sacrificed himself in a battle against the Tianshi Sect, saving nearly a million commoners!" Yu Pengfei spoke with reverence as he introduced this to Luo Tian.

Hearing Yu Pengfei's words, Luo Tian was stunned before displaying reverence. He bowed respectfully to the statue, deeply admiring this sect leader's sacrifice.

As a sect leader of Feiyun Sect, he was undoubtedly an outstanding cultivator. At that time, Feiyun Sect was a top-tier sect in the world. Such a powerful cultivator sacrificing himself to save those deemed insignificant by other great cultivators was worthy of every person's bow.

Seeing the reverence in Luo Tian's eyes, Yu Pengfei's resentment towards him lessened. The other Feiyun Sect disciples also felt their perception of Luo Tian slightly improved.

Subsequently, Yu Pengfei led Luo Tian past several tombs, introducing each person's history. This improved Luo Tian's perception of Feiyun Sect significantly.

Finally, Yu Pengfei led Luo Tian to an unassuming tomb. A stone tablet stood before them with the inscription "Feiyun Sect Elder, Lan Yuting's Tomb." Small characters beside it detailed Lan Yuting's life.

However, when Luo Tian saw an unassuming small mound beneath the tombstone, his face again displayed sorrow. A small tomb like a spear pierced Luo Tian's heart, causing him to struggle for breath.

"Feiyun Sect Elder Lan Yuting's direct disciple, Chen Yunting's Tomb!" Luo Tian gazed at the red characters, tears streaming down his cheeks.

Luo Tian stood motionless before this unassuming tomb, as if time had stopped. He said nothing. If someone were to attack him at this moment, he would be unable to react.

The Feiyun Sect disciples and Yu Pengfei watched Luo Tian, who was lost in sorrow. They all sighed deeply, feeling moved by the two's experiences.

One hour... Two hours...

Time slowly passed. Luo Tian remained motionless, and the Feiyun Sect disciples and Yu Pengfei dared not disturb him. The cemetery fell into infinite silence.

"Yuting, I, Luo Tian, swear today at your tomb that one day I will bring Li Xiuping and use his blood to sacrifice for you!" After three hours, Luo Tian finally broke the silence, shouting lowly.

"I also wish to visit the place where she lived!" Luo Tian turned around, his eyes carrying a hint of entreaty as he spoke softly to Yu Pengfei.

Seeing the entreaty in Luo Tian's eyes, they could not connect this man with the merciless killer of yesterday.

For Luo Tian's request, Yu Pengfei had wanted to refuse. The longer Luo Tian stayed in Feiyun Sect, the more difficult it would be for the disciples to endure.

But when Yu Pengfei saw Luo Tian's entreaty, he felt some compassion. He sighed softly: "Alright, I'll make the decision. But you must promise me to leave after seeing it!"

"Yes!" Luo Tian nodded slightly and fell silent again.

Yu Pengfei sighed, leading Luo Tian and several direct disciples towards Lan Yuting's residence.

Lan Yuting was Chen Yunting's teacher. Naturally, Chen Yunting lived with Lan Yuting. They soon arrived at the small courtyard where Chen Yunting had resided.

The courtyard was not large but very tranquil. There were some weeds, indicating no one had cleaned it recently.

"Since Lan Yuting was framed by Deng Jiusi and Li Xiuping and imprisoned in the dungeon, no one has cleaned this courtyard!" Yu Pengfei explained softly.

Luo Tian seemed not to hear and entered the small house. Though no one had cleaned it, a girl's fragrance could still be smelled within, though somewhat masked by the dust. Yet Luo Tian could still detect this familiar scent.

Standing alone in the room for a while, Luo Tian got up and began to tidy the items within. He carefully wiped each item repeatedly, placing them into his storage ring. Not even the smallest needle was overlooked.

Time slowly passed. The sky had turned dim, and Luo Tian finally reluctantly left the house, gazing at the numerous hostile eyes around him. He paid no heed.

With a wave of his hand, Luo Tian surrounded himself with numerous small and large medicinal pill bottles, forming a river of pills neatly arranged. Though sealed, they still emitted a faint fragrance.

"What are these pills? I feel my cultivation has improved after just smelling them!" One of the direct disciples exclaimed in astonishment.

"These bottles must contain top-grade medicinal pills!" Another disciple, who understood medicine, sniffed the air and exclaimed in astonishment.

Chapter 113: The Change in Tianyuan City

Chapter 113: The Change in Tianyuan City

Upon hearing the disciple's voice, the other Feiyun Sect disciples turned their heads towards him. Upon seeing who had spoken, they were shocked. This disciple was Shen Qingping, the only sixth-grade alchemy disciple of Feiyun Sect and had reached the fourth-grade level himself.

"Senior Shen, could you produce such pills?" People asked him.

Shen Qingping carefully sniffed the fragrance again before his face showed astonishment: "The vitality of herbs is so rich! Some even reached seventy percent!"

"I can't produce them. Though I am a fourth-grade alchemist, I can only make pills with over fifty percent vitality of herbs. But it requires luck and good conditions. However, the pills he produced are at least fifty percent vitality of herbs. This is beyond most people's abilities!" Shen Qingping said in astonishment.

As the only sixth-grade alchemy disciple of Feiyun Sect, his talent and strength were exceptional. Yet he was still awed by Luo Tian's skill.

Under the astonished gazes of others, Shen Qingping spoke again: "If these pills were made by Luo Tian, then his alchemy talent is no less than his physical body. Perhaps even stronger!"

The other disciples, though not fully understanding, knew these bottles contained top-grade medicinal pills. They all looked greedily at the thousand bottles lying on the ground.

"Latecomer is willing to exchange these pills for Chen Yunting's belongings!" Luo Tian's voice rang out, addressing Yu Pengfei.

Yu Pengfei had also heard Shen Qingping's words and was astonished by Luo Tian's alchemy talent. However, upon hearing Luo Tian wanted to exchange these pills for Chen Yunting's belongings, Yu Pengfei's face became even more astonished.

Luo Tian's gesture was too grand. Any single pill he produced would be enough to exchange for something, yet he had brought so many. This proved how much Chen Yunting meant to him.

"These are too many. I can decide to give you Chen Yuting's belongings, but these pills are too precious!" Yu Pengfei said with a trembling voice. He was reluctant to part with so many top-grade pills, but his mind returned to Nan Gongxiu's words, forcing him to say this.

"Thank you for your kindness. Since I've brought them out, there's no reason to take them back. In my heart, these pills together are not worth a single needle Chen Yunting used!" Luo Tian's eyes showed determination.

"If you feel reluctant, consider it as compensation for Feiyun Sect. I did kill too many people yesterday! Though I know this isn't enough, in the future, every disciple of Feiyun Sect can receive a free batch of pills with their identity token!" Luo Tian continued without waiting for Yu Pengfei's response.

"Ah, hearing Luo Tian's resolute words!" The other Feiyun Sect disciples showed surprise. They couldn't believe their eyes, seeing the killer from yesterday now apologizing for his actions.

Shen Qingping also showed an expression of disbelief. It wasn't that he cared about Luo Tian's apology, but he hadn't expected these pills to be made by Luo Tian himself. He had thought they were given by the Dan Pavilion elders to Luo Tian, as he was a Wuxing body genius and would be valued everywhere.

Knowing these pills were truly made by Luo Tian, Shen Qingping's mood was somewhat low. He had always taken pride in his alchemy talent, but now compared to Luo Tian, he was far behind. These pills, in his mind, could only be made by his master with over fifty percent vitality of herbs.

"Alright! I'll accept them on behalf of Feiyun Sect. From now on, there will be no grudge between you and Feiyun Sect." Yu Pengfei waved his hand, collecting the bottles around Luo Tian.

Luo Tian said nothing more. He bowed to Yu Pengfei and walked away from the mountain gate, disappearing from their sight.

The disciples of Feiyun Sect watched Luo Tian's distant figure. A strange feeling arose in their hearts, and they no longer felt particularly hostile towards this young man.

"Little fellow, that's more like it! Otherwise, the anger of Feiyun Sect disciples would be hard to calm!" Nan Gongxiu sat on the peak of Feiyun Sect, watching Luo Tian gradually descend from Feiyun Sect, speaking softly.

...

Tianyuan City, the Gu family.

After arriving in Tianyuan City, Lei Yong and others didn't stay long. Lei Yong and Ji Chen led the disciples of Wuxing Sect back to their sect, eager to return the news about Tianshi Sect.

Gu Qianshui and Gu Lei remained at the Gu family. One reason was to spend more time with Gu Yun, and another was to wait for Luo Tian to go alone to Feiyun Sect and return with him.

"Sister, do you think Luo Tian will come back safely?" Gu Lei asked idly.

"Master Nan Gongxiu wanted to keep him. He stayed yesterday, but it might have been troublesome entering Feiyun Sect. Actually, I'm more worried about his emotional wounds!" Gu Qianshui's face showed concern as she sighed softly.

Regarding Chen Yunting, Gu Qianshui didn't know her feelings. Due to Luo Tian's relationship, she had never liked this woman and even felt some resentment. However, after learning the truth yesterday, she was moved by Chen Yunting's sacrifice. Yet, since her beloved person had another's shadow in his heart, she was torn.

While they were chatting, three guests arrived at the Gu family's main gate. An old man and two young men.

"Boom..." The three walked to the gate without heeding the guards' resistance. One young man punched at the gate, sending the guards flying back with their energy.

"Gu Yun, come out and meet me!" The old man's voice was calm but clear enough to reach every person in the Gu family.

Gu Yun, who had been in the main courtyard, suddenly changed his expression. His face was extremely grim.

He stood up abruptly and walked to the main gate, looking at the three men walking in.

Gu Qianshui and Gu Lei heard the voice and quickly arrived at the main gate, standing behind Gu Yun.

"Dad, do you know them?" Gu Qianshui asked in a serious tone.

The three people, whether the old man or the young men, gave Gu Qianshui and Gu Lei a strong sense of pressure. Those who could make Gu Qianshui and Gu Lei feel pressure must be at the bone-destroying stage, especially the old man, who might even be higher.

"Hey, Gu Yun, haven't you forgotten me after so many years?" The old man looked at Gu Yun with contempt and smiled softly.

Chapter 114: Poison

Chapter 114: Poison

After speaking, the old man said nothing more and looked at Gu Yun with mockery.

Gu Yun saw the old man, his whole body trembling unnaturally. He couldn't speak for a moment.

"Those two must be your and Feiyan's children, right? In a blink, they've grown so big!" The old man looked at Gu Qianshui and Gu Lei and asked softly.

Upon hearing the word "Feiyan," Gu Yun's body trembled again. He then spoke with a trembling voice: "Feiyan! Is she alright?"

Gu Qianshui frowned, feeling some disdain towards the two young men. She also sensed her father was acting strangely today.

"Usually, my father is so bold and fearless. Why does he act so abnormal when seeing this old man? Who is Feiyan?" Thoughts of confusion arose in Gu Qianshui and Gu Lei's minds.

But when they heard the old man's words, both of them remembered a memory: a gentle figure. "Mother!"

"Feiyan is fine, just missing her children!" The old man smiled and answered. His eyes looked at Gu Qianshui and Gu Lei, clearly satisfied with their cultivation.

However, upon hearing the old man's words, Gu Yun trembled again. His face showed anger, clearly understanding the meaning behind the old man's words.

"No!" Gu Yun's voice was almost a roar, echoing in everyone's ears.

"What do you mean 'no'? Who are you, old man?" Gu Lei asked in confusion, not knowing why his father was so agitated.

"You're Gu Lei, right? A long time has passed. When I saw you before, you were just born. Qianshui wasn't old enough to remember. In terms of lineage, I should be your third grandfather!" The old man looked at Gu Qianshui and Gu Lei with a calm face.

"Have you taken my wife away from me? Do you also want to take my children away from me?" Gu Yun's voice was barely controlled, shouting lowly.

"Hmph. The bloodline of the Shangguan family shouldn't flow outside!" Before the old man could speak, one of the young men spoke with a sneer. His eyes were looking down on them, even though Gu Yun was one rank higher.

"Would you like to see your mother?" The old man ignored Gu Yun's roar and asked Gu Qianshui and Gu Lei with a kind expression.

"Mother?" Gu Lei and Gu Qianshui looked at the old man with a glimmer of hope. However, seeing their father's strange state, they cautiously watched this third grandfather.

"Third grandfather, why don't you bring our mother directly here so we can reunite as a family?" Gu Lei, knowing something was definitely wrong, asked softly.

"Your mother has some matters to handle and can't come. If you two go with us, naturally, you'll be able to see your mother!" The old man continued speaking kindly.

"Qianshui, go with us. In this small city of Tianyuan, you've reached the eighth level of refining body. Your talent isn't bad. If you go to our Youming Sect, your cultivation will rapidly improve!"

After the old man spoke, another young man continued to persuade.

Gu Qianshui knew there was definitely something wrong. She and her brother didn't know who this person claiming to be their third grandfather was, nor his intentions. However, seeing their father's obvious dislike for these three people, even to the point of hostility, Gu Lei and Gu Qianshui couldn't help but look at Gu Yun.

"No!" Gu Lei's cold voice cut through their conversation, resuming his role as the head of the Gu family.

"Get out... What are you? Daring to speak like this to us!" One of the young men cursed, his aura of bone-destroying stage not sparingly pressing against Gu Yun.

Gu Yun was only at the sixth level of refining body. How could he withstand it? His body took a few steps back, and blood flowed from his mouth.

"You dare to hurt my father!" Gu Lei saw Gu Yun injured, his eyes instantly turned red. Regardless of whether the opponent was at bone-destroying stage, he rushed towards the young man.

The young man saw Gu Lei rushing toward him and smiled faintly. He slowly extended his hand, firmly grasping Gu Lei's fist that was coming toward him. His body felt like a mountain.

Although Gu Lei knew he wasn't the young man's match, his impulsive nature made him charge forward. However, at this moment, he felt his fist hit cotton and couldn't exert force. Even the energy in his body was running slowly.

"Ah..." Gu Lei roared, emitting a white mist from his fist.

"The poison!" As the white mist emerged, it seeped into the young man's palm pores.

The young man saw the white mist and knew it was poison. However, due to his confidence in his strength, he allowed the white mist to enter his body.

But as soon as the white mist entered his body, the young man's face turned grim. As the white mist entered his body, it rushed through his meridians like a raging fire. Worse still, the poison could ignite energy. Wherever it went, his meridians' energy burned uncontrollably.

The young man quickly pushed Gu Lei away and started to use his cultivation to suppress the increasingly strong white mist within him.

"One Qi Fire Dragon Poison!" The old man, who claimed to be Gu Qianshui's third grandfather, looked at Gu Lei in disbelief.

"Hmph! Daring to hurt my father. Even if you're at bone-destroying stage, this poison won't kill you, but it's enough to make you suffer!" Gu Lei's face showed coldness. He was clearly furious at the young man for injuring his father.

Gu Qianshui watched Gu Lei's actions, a look of satisfaction on her face. Her younger brother had truly grown up. Though impulsive, he still knew how to think.

Gu Lei had clearly used his impulsiveness and cultivation to trick the young man, giving him an opportunity to successfully apply poison through physical contact.

"Damn! What kind of poison is this? That damned kid!" The young man's face showed anger.

Although the poison didn't harm him fundamentally, as a bone-destroying stage cultivator's energy was stronger than that of refining body, he had to calm down and deal with this annoying One Qi Fire Dragon Poison. He secretly regretted his carelessness but was also shocked that a mere refining body seventh-level person could have tricked him.

"Gu Yun, I must take these two children with me today. The Shangguan family's bloodline shouldn't flow outside!" The old man, seeing Gu Lei's attack, spoke more firmly.

Chapter 115: Earth-Grade Weapon

Chapter 115: Earth-Grade Weapon

"Ha, take them. Make them into killers without feelings like you?" Gu Yun wiped the blood from his mouth, a bitter smile on his face.

"Your Shangguan family's business doesn't concern you!" Another young man, with a calm face, stepped forward. Like his companion, he pressed his aura against Gu Yun.

But Gu Qianshui and Gu Lei had already prepared, so they wouldn't let him succeed again. Their auras suddenly rose and converged to block the young man's aura, causing wind to whistle around them.

Gu Qianshui and Gu Lei looked at the young man with determination, a sense of helplessness rising within them. Although Gu Lei had successfully tricked the young man before, it was a miracle. It wouldn't happen again, especially with the more terrifying old man.

Seeing Gu Qianshui and Gu Lei block the young man's aura, the old man's eyes became brighter. He was clearly attracted by their strength and talent.

The young man, seeing Gu Qianshui and Gu Lei block his aura, flashed a hint of anger. He unleashed his early-stage bone-destroying cultivation and punched forward. Wood-element energy, usually gentle, became an unstoppable arrow in his hands, rushing toward them.

Gu Qianshui and Gu Lei were both proud individuals. However, facing a bone-destroying stage cultivator, they felt helpless. Even if they combined their strength, it was difficult to withstand this overwhelming punch. What about the next one?

As they pondered, the fierce wood-element energy formed into a fist and approached them.

"Boom!" The sound of explosion rang out. A thin figure appeared before Gu Qianshui and Gu Lei, a sorrowful aura surrounding him.

They had already activated all their energy to block this punch. Now, they were excitedly watching the familiar figure before them.

"Luo Tian!" They excitedly watched the thin figure, hope rising in their hearts. However, upon looking at the three people, that hope was instantly extinguished.

They admitted Luo Tian was strong. But he was still only at the ninth level of refining body. Even if he had defeated Elder Lan Yuting before, that wasn't his true strength. Moreover, Elder Lan Yuting had been controlled and lacked consciousness, significantly weakening her power.

But these three were different. Even one of them was beyond Luo Tian's current ability to handle.

"Who are they?" Luo Tian took a few steps back, shaking his numb arms and asked in a low voice.

"They are my mother's relatives!" Gu Qianshui said with gritted teeth, her eyes filled with hatred.

"They are!" Luo Tian's face showed a serious expression upon hearing they were related to Gu Qianshui's mother. He knew a little about his mother's story, but he hadn't expected these people to come looking for him.

Seeing Luo Tian single-handedly block his grandson's punch, the old man showed a brief surprise. He was more interested now and smiled: "Young man, would you like to join my Youming Sect? I can personally take you as a disciple!"

Hearing the old man's words, which sounded like charity, Luo Tian showed no change. He coldly said three words: "No interest!"

"Kid, you're really ungrateful! Being able to have me, your third grandfather, take you as a disciple is already giving you great favor. You don't even kneel down, but you dare to refuse?" The young man, hearing Luo Tian's words, showed anger. His fists glowed with green light again.

"What do you want?" Gu Qianshui knew they were no match and asked softly.

"Of course, we want to take you with us. We'll cultivate you! Do you feel oppressed? If you had strength, you wouldn't be in this situation today. If you had strength, you wouldn't watch your father suffer so pitifully! And the Shangguan family will give you everything!" The old man spoke persuasively.

"Of course, you can choose not to go. Then, for the sake of our Shangguan family's bloodline, today you three will all die here!" The old man didn't wait for Gu Lei and Gu Qianshui to respond but continued speaking. His voice turned cold, clearly uninterested in Luo Tian's answer and losing patience.

"You, Shangguan Fei! You're still a person. Don't be shameless by calling yourself their third grandfather!" Gu Yun, hearing the old man's words, could no longer control his emotions and shouted lowly.

"Hmph. I spared your life back then, which was already generous of the Shangguan family. I advise you to persuade these two to go with me. Otherwise, if you anger me, I'll slaughter this entire Tianyuan City!" Shangguan Fei looked down with contempt, his aura slowly rising.

"I'll fight to the death today and won't let you succeed! Yin魂 Bell!" Gu Yun shouted desperately.

"Boom..." The heavy bell sound rang out, startling everyone in the Gu family.

"Yin魂 Bell? Feiyun Sect was once a powerful clan. I didn't expect it to have declined to just an earth-grade weapon, and even a broken one!" Shangguan Fei heard the Yin魂 Bell's sound and showed a slight smile.

As Gu Yun shouted, the Yin魂 Bell on the training ground of the Gu family suddenly glowed with dark light and transformed into a black streak, landing before Gu Yun and others.

Upon hearing the bell sound, the disciples of the Gu family gathered at the main gate. They looked at the three people outside and felt a strong pressure, their faces turning grim.

The Gu family was currently thriving in Tianyuan City. However, compared to the outside world, it was still too small. Even a bone-destroying stage cultivator wasn't something the Gu family could match.

And Gu Yun had used the Yin魂 Bell. Seeing the hostility in Gu Qianshui and Gu Lei's eyes, it was clear these three were not friends of the Gu family.

"We are disciples of Wuxing Sect. You dare to attack us? Don't you fear retaliation from Wuxing Sect?" Gu Lei shouted loudly.

Hearing Gu Lei's shout, Shangguan Fei's face briefly showed fear. He laughed: "Wuxing Sect? I don't believe Wuxing would dare to oppose me over just two disciples!"

Hearing Shangguan Fei's arrogant words, the three people's faces changed. They hadn't expected that Youming Sect was so powerful that even Wuxing Sect only slightly feared it.

Luo Tian felt a bad premonition. These three were too powerful. Even if he used all his strength, he couldn't defeat them. Seeing Gu Yun's stance clearly indicating he was willing to fight to the death, it was likely that today the Gu family would be destroyed.

While Luo Tian thought, Gu Yun's words echoed through his mind: "Find an opportunity and try to get Qianshui and Lei to escape! This time, it's my Gu family that has dragged you into this!"

Chapter 116: Master Tian

Chapter 116: Master Tian

Upon hearing Gu Yun's instructions, Luo Tian felt a bad premonition. His face showed a bitter expression. Could he escape from these bone-destroying stage cultivators? It was clearly a difficult question.

As Luo Tian felt bitter, the Yin魂 Bell landed before them with the wind.
