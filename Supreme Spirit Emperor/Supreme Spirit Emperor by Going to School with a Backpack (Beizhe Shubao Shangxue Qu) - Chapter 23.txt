Nangong Xiu listened to Deng Jiusi's words, his expression darkening with each passing moment. Naturally, he had sensed that Luo Tian possessed a Five Elements Body. Though Luo Tian's meridians were currently filled with blood-red spiritual energy, an Xuanling Realm cultivator like himself could not fail to perceive the residual five-element spiritual energy within Luo Tian's body.

He mentally cursed Deng Jiusi for being a fool, but considering the current situation, Nangong Xiu coldly inquired: "Where is Li Xiuping?"

As the sect's leader, Nangong Xiu naturally knew about Li Xiuping. If it had been a minor secular family instead of disciples from the Five Elements Sect, he would have let this matter pass. But since it was the Five Elements Sect's disciples who had come, this issue was no longer simple. The immediate priority was to locate Li Xiuping first.

When Nangong Xiu asked about Li Xiuping, Deng Jiusi's face darkened further. He honestly replied: "I don't know."

"Know? Good, good! Deng Jiusi, you've managed the Feiyun Sect so well!" Nangong Xiu shouted loudly. The entire Feiyun Mountain trembled three times, revealing the depth of his anger.

"Old fox!" Lei Yong glared at Nangong Xiu cursing Deng Jiusi, and spoke out.

"Why say that?" The Five Elements Sect disciples heard Lei Yong's low curse and instinctively looked up at him. Clearly, the Xuanling Realm Nangong Xiu and that earth dragon had exerted considerable pressure on them, subtly positioning Lei Yong as their leader.

"That old fox's curse was clearly meant for us. If my guess is correct, this old man will soon symbolically punish Deng Jiusi!" Lei Yong lowered his voice.

Indeed, as soon as Lei Yong's words finished, Nangong Xiu's voice echoed in perfect timing: "Committing such a grave mistake, I'll have you clean the entire Feiyun Sect for a month and seal your cultivation. Do you accept?"

Hearing Nangong Xiu's words, everyone looked at Lei Yong with admiration. They hadn't expected the seemingly rough Lei Yong to be so clever.

As the crowd praised Lei Yong, he wore a triumphant smile on his face.

Ji Chen, however, had a twitching mouth. Others might not know why Lei Yong said that, but he certainly knew—this was precisely the tactic their lineage often used. Every time Lei Yong and Ji Chen caused trouble, Zhang Ziping would scold them harshly before pretending to punish them slightly. In truth, no one knew if they were actually punished!

"I accept," Deng Jiusi said after hearing Nangong Xiu's words. His eyes flickered with a brief surprise, but it vanished instantly. After so many years of living, he knew Nangong Xiu was protecting him. He quickly agreed.

Hearing Deng Jiusi's response, Nangong Xiu nodded in satisfaction. He extended his hand to seal Deng Jiusi's cultivation, then turned to look at Luo Tian who had been subdued by the earth dragon. His eyes showed a flicker of admiration, but he also knew that under these circumstances, he and Luo Tian could never be friends.

He slowly approached Luo Tian's front, observing his current state. His face furrowed slightly—this was the first time he had seen such an overwhelming killing aura. At this moment, Luo Tian's suppressed rage had already caused slight cracks on his body, and his veins were stretched unnaturally wide. If this continued, Luo Tian would be on the verge of exploding.

Looking at the corpses scattered before the mountain gate, Nangong Xiu longed to strike Luo Tian down with a single palm. But he knew he couldn't do that. If he did, it wouldn't just be these people who died.

Nangong Xiu knew that if he killed Luo Tian today, the Five Elements Sect would descend upon him in full force tomorrow. The entire Feiyun Sect would be destroyed. He was aware of the Five Elements Sect's terror, even though he himself had reached the late Xuanling Realm. He didn't believe he could escape their pursuit.

Nangong Xiu couldn't kill Luo Tian, but instead had to save him. If Luo Tian died under his care, the Five Elements Sect would certainly not let this pass. The thought made Nangong Xiu feel utterly humiliated. A sect leader of the Feiyun Sect was now forced to save a body-tempering disciple who had devastated his sect.

Yet when he saw his steed, the earth dragon that had accompanied him for years, his face turned even more astonished.

That earth dragon's originally fierce gaze showed a hint of fear when it saw Luo Tian, even trembling slightly. This bewildered Nangong Xiu. The earth dragon had been with him for years like a brother, and its strength was nearly comparable to his own. Yet it showed fear toward this small body-tempering disciple?

"Xiaojiu! What's wrong?" Nangong Xiu called out to the earth dragon, asking.

"Ugh..." The earth dragon no longer had its former ferocity. It was like a child, wishing to stay as far away from Luo Tian as possible. However, out of face, it remained in place but dared not move an inch, fearing to disturb Luo Tian.

Ignoring why the earth dragon was so afraid, Nangong Xiu sighed deeply. He approached Luo Tian because he could clearly hear the sound of his meridians breaking. If they delayed any longer, Luo Tian would either die or be permanently crippled.

Nangong Xiu took Luo Tian into his hands, activating his spiritual core to forcibly extract the blood-red spiritual energy from Luo Tian's body.

Gu Qianxue saw Luo Tian fall into Nangong Xiu's hands, her face showing concern. She was about to step forward but was pulled back by Ning Qingzhu: "Don't be reckless. That old man is saving Luo Tian!"

After hearing Ning Qingzhu's explanation, Gu Qianxue finally calmed down. However, her eyes remained cautious as she watched Luo Tian in Nangong Xiu's hands.

Nangong Xiu, filled with resentment, continuously extracted the killing aura from Luo Tian's body into his own. After being restrained by the Xuanling Realm, this killing aura gradually condensed into a black pearl in Nangong Xiu's hand.

As the killing aura was extracted, Luo Tian's face gradually shifted from red to a pale complexion. Nangong Xiu was increasingly astonished—he had never expected Luo Tian's killing aura to condense into a Killing Aura Pearl.

Chapter 107: The Truth Revealed

When Nangong Xiu's hand floated with the third Killing Aura Pearl, the Chronological Scripture in Luo Tian's mind seemed to sense something. The final page slowly closed, no longer emitting a single thread of killing aura.

Without the Chronological Scripture's supply, Luo Tian's killing aura gradually diminished under Nangong Xiu's extraction.

Time passed slowly. Soon, an hour had elapsed. Even with Nangong Xiu's cultivation, facing such a massive amount of killing aura was still exhausting. When the fourth Killing Aura Pearl formed in his hand, Nangong Xiu took a deep breath.

Without the killing aura's erosion, Luo Tian's face finally returned to a normal complexion. Though his face was slightly pale from weakness.

Luo Tian gradually opened his eyes, gazing at Nangong Xiu with a look of confusion. He didn't know who this middle-aged man was.

"Thank you, elder," Luo Tian bowed respectfully to Nangong Xiu. Though he knew this middle-aged man was likely from the Feiyun Sect, he still politely thanked him for saving his life.

Hearing Luo Tian's gratitude, Nangong Xiu's resentful expression slightly improved. He mentally scolded Deng Jiusi for wasting such a promising talent.

"Given the current situation, Luo Tian still managed to express gratitude. This boy must be someone who repays kindness. If this boy were in my Feiyun Sect, how could we not rise to be a top sect again?" Nangong Xiu inwardly regretted, vowing not to merely focus on cultivation but to personally manage the sect's affairs.

If another incident like this occurred, the Feiyun Sect would surely suffer again. At that time, whether it could even become a second-rate sect was uncertain.

"Boy, have you caused enough trouble in the Feiyun Sect?" Nangong Xiu looked at Luo Tian coldly, speaking softly.

"Boom..." As soon as Luo Tian heard the words "Feiyun Sect," his aura suddenly sharpened. Regardless of who this middle-aged man was, his eyes turned blood-red again.

"I want to know how Chen Yunting died!" Luo Tian's cold voice echoed in people's ears.

"Who is Chen Yunting?" People were puzzled, wondering who could make the composed Luo Tian so frenzied, even nearly falling into a killing frenzy.

"It was indeed because of her!" Gu Qianxue's eyes filled with tears, as if struck by a sharp object. Her heart convulsed.

"Who is Chen Yunting? How did she die? Does anyone know?" Nangong Xiu surveyed the crowd, his face cold.

"I do," Deng Jiusi reluctantly stepped forward, a bitter smile on his face.

"Speak!" Seeing it was again Deng Jiusi, Nangong Xiu's face finally showed genuine anger. He knew this matter was related to Li Xiuping again.

Under Nangong Xiu's furious gaze, Deng Jiusi recounted the reason for Chen Yunting's death. People finally understood why Luo Tian had become so enraged.

At the time, when Luo Tian and Chen Yunting first arrived at the mountain, Chen Yunting was taken as a disciple by Lan Yu. Luo Tian, however, remained an ordinary servant. Their cultivation levels were worlds apart. Chen Yunting was very beautiful and quickly caught Li Xiuping's attention.

Though Lan Yu had some status in the Feiyun Sect, she could not compare to Deng Jiusi. Li Xiuping was a favored disciple of the Feiyun Sect, and anything he desired in the sect could not be denied.

Under pressure and temptation, Chen Yunting refused to comply. However, Li Xiuping somehow discovered the relationship between Luo Tian and Chen Yunting. He threatened Luo Tian's life to force Chen Yunting. To protect Luo Tian, she pretended to despise him and let Li Xiuping expel Luo Tian from the mountain.

In Chen Yunting's mind, this was at least a way for Luo Tian to survive and live as an ordinary person. Even if Luo Tian hated her forever, it was worth it.

The events unfolded exactly as Chen Yunting had planned. Luo Tian was expelled from the mountain. That night, Li Xiuping proposed to marry Chen Yunting. She reluctantly agreed.

But the next day, Chen Yunting committed suicide in her room, holding a moldy bun in her hand.

As Deng Jiusi recounted this, Luo Tian's eyes welled with tears. When he heard Chen Yunting held a moldy bun in her hand, his head suddenly felt like it exploded. He roared into the sky, repeatedly pounding his chest.

Luo Tian was furious—furious at Li Xiuping, furious at Deng Jiusi. But he hated himself even more. That woman who had once mocked him was all an act, just to let him live. Yet he had constantly resented her.

"Stupid girl, do you know that after I was expelled from the mountain, that Li person also pursued me?" Luo Tian gradually calmed down, his eyes showing tenderness.

Hearing Deng Jiusi's account, the people around also showed admiration. Some female disciples even wept. Ning Qingzhu was one of them. She admired the woman who had sacrificed everything for her beloved, who had risked her life for him, and who had made him hate her.

"Winning against you, I don't regret it. But rest assured, I will take care of her with your love!" Gu Qianxue also had tears in her eyes, whispering to herself.

Nangong Xiu was completely furious. He hadn't expected Deng Jiusi to take advantage of his absence to do such things.

"Where is Lan Yu?" Nangong Xiu's cold voice rang out, asking Deng Jiusi again.

"Lan Yu is dead! She was also killed by this master and disciple!" The elder who had watched Lan Yu's death spoke lowly, clearly deeply affected by her passing.

No one asked, but this elder recounted the entire process of Lan Yu's death.

"Buzz..." Nangong Xiu could no longer contain his anger. His Xuanling Realm cultivation fully erupted. He had thought it was just a disciple's betrayal, but Deng Jiusi had even dared to imprison and frame an elder while he was away.

He extended his hand, but Deng Jiusi could not resist. Nangong Xiu grabbed his throat, instantly turning red-faced. He knew Nangong Xiu was truly angry. Deng Jiusi had known Nangong Xiu for many years, and he knew Nangong Xiu hated internal strife among elders most.

"An elder, you dare to frame! What use is the Feiyun Sect if it's so corrupt!" Nangong Xiu raised his hand high, but several times he wanted to strike it down, yet it remained suspended in the air.

Chapter 108: Nangong Xiu's Resentment

The elders from Deng Jiusi's faction around him saw Nangong Xiu's hand hovering and thought, "There's hope!"

"Please, Sect Leader, show mercy!" The few remaining elders who had fought with the Five Elements Sect fell to their knees and loudly pleaded for Deng Jiusi's life.

Nangong Xiu truly wanted to kill Deng Jiusi, but he couldn't. Deng Jiusi was a late-stage Hua Gu (Bone-Transformation) powerhouse on the verge of reaching Bone-Transformation Peak. At this moment, the Feiyun Sect had already suffered heavy losses due to Luo Tian's incident. Not only did they lose disciples, but nearly a quarter of their Bone-Transformation elders had died, not to mention the injured. The Feiyun Sect was in dire need of strong Bone-Transformation cultivators.

A sect's most crucial asset was its Bone-Transformation masters. Xuanling Realm cultivators merely served as deterrents, while the true foundation of a sect was its Bone-Transformation masters.

Hearing people pleading for Deng Jiusi, Nangong Xiu sighed inwardly. He had a way out and decided to act convincingly, as the over a thousand Five Elements Sect disciples were still watching. He spoke with a difficult expression: "Are you also pleading for him?"

Though Nangong Xiu had planned to have the elders cooperate with him, he would reprimand Deng Jiusi a bit more and then punish him lightly to end the matter. Though he thought this way, he had forgotten that not everyone was his mind-reader.

Hearing Nangong Xiu's realistic roar, the elders who had pleaded for Deng Jiusi were all terrified and trembled, no longer daring to speak for Deng Jiusi.

Nangong Xiu roared again and waited for people to plead once more, allowing him to take the opportunity to lower his hand. But instead, these elders who had pleaded for Deng Jiusi were so frightened by Nangong Xiu's roar that they trembled and said nothing.

Nangong Xiu's roar was too realistic. Even Deng Jiusi, who had been in the Feiyun Sect for years, almost fell for it. However, with Deng Jiusi's experience, he naturally knew Nangong Xiu wouldn't kill him. This was why he had dared to act recklessly while Nangong Xiu was in seclusion.

But the current situation left Deng Jiusi speechless. Though he knew Nangong Xiu was faking it, at this moment his cultivation had been sealed and he was even weaker than a body-tempering disciple. He was also held by Nangong Xiu.

Deng Jiusi's face turned red, unable to speak. He could only look at the elders of his faction with a desperate gaze, but those few elders kept their heads down and said nothing. Deng Jiusi almost vomited blood.

At this moment, Deng Jiusi desperately hoped those few elders would look at him. Just one glance, and with their experience, they would understand his meaning.

Nangong Xiu was also somewhat annoyed at those terrified elders. He had already reached a dead end, as killing Deng Jiusi would be too painful, but not killing him would make his face lose credibility.

Luo Tian had also somewhat recovered and understood the situation. He could guess Nangong Xiu's identity. Seeing Nangong Xiu's hand hovering, he understood that Nangong Xiu was unwilling to kill Deng Jiusi.

His eyes flashed with coldness. Luo Tian's hatred for Deng Jiusi was no less than Li Xiuping. Without Deng Jiusi's tolerance, Li Xiuping would not have acted so recklessly in the Feiyun Sect.

Seeing Deng Jiusi's cultivation sealed and even weaker than a body-tempering disciple, Luo Tian's thoughts became active. He had been observing the situation carefully and knew he only had one chance. If this failed, there would be no more opportunities.

At the moment Nangong Xiu hesitated, Luo Tian knew his chance had come. Like a venomous snake in the night, he revealed his cold fangs.

"Master Nangong, I'll help you!" Luo Tian activated the five-tenths of his recovered cultivation and concentrated it all into his Cracked Heaven Spear, then hurled it at Deng Jiusi held by Nangong Xiu.

A dark light flashed, like a meteor, instantly reaching Deng Jiusi's front.

At this moment, people's attention was on Nangong Xiu. But Nangong Xiu didn't notice Luo Tian's eyes filled with hatred.

He also ignored Luo Tian. In his mind, with himself present, Luo Tian would never have a chance to act. Luo Tian wouldn't dare raise his sword against the Feiyun Sect disciples again in front of him.

But fate was contrary. Nangong Xiu had underestimated Luo Tian's courage. Not only did he dare to act against Nangong Xiu, but even if it were someone with higher cultivation, Luo Tian would not hesitate to strike.

"Poof!" The Cracked Heaven Spear, with its destructive power, deeply pierced Deng Jiusi's throat.

Deng Jiusi still maintained his desperate gaze toward the surrounding elders, and Nangong Xiu also kept holding Deng Jiusi in his hand, eyes filled with disbelief.

Silence. The scene seemed frozen. People stared at Deng Jiusi pierced by the dark spear, their faces filled with shock and disbelief.

"Boom..." The next moment, people finally erupted. They stared at the panting Luo Tian in disbelief. No one expected Luo Tian to dare kill the Feiyun Sect's Grand Elder in front of Nangong Xiu, and it had actually succeeded.

Nangong Xiu also stared at Deng Jiusi who was dead beyond death, unable to believe that he had been caught off guard by Luo Tian. He never expected Deng Jiusi, under his own eyes, to be killed by a body-tempering disciple he had considered as an ant.

This was a blatant humiliation. Nangong Xiu felt his face burning with shame and humiliation.

The Feiyun Sect elders also looked at the dead Deng Jiusi, feeling a sense of injustice. A Bone-Transformation late-stage master, under the hand of an Xuanling Realm cultivator, was killed by a body-tempering disciple. How could one not feel injustice?

After the Cracked Heaven Spear pierced Deng Jiusi, it returned to Luo Tian's front. Luo Tian had exhausted all his strength from that spear and now stood with the spear in hand, a triumphant expression on his face.

"Master Nangong, don't thank me. It was a small effort. Killing such a traitor of the Feiyun Sect, why should Master Nangong do it himself? After all, I was once a disciple of the Feiyun Sect. This is my way of repaying the three years of cultivation from the sect!"

Luo Tian said weakly.

"Boom..." Nangong Xiu's face darkened, his face red with a deep crack extending from his feet. One could see how furious he was.

Chapter 109: Li Xiuping's Escape

Nangong Xiu was now furious, his face dark as he looked at the panting Luo Tian. Seeing Luo Tian calmly looking back at him, a deep crack extended from his feet toward Luo Tian. Nangong Xiu knew that with just one move, he could kill this weak genius.

"Too bold!" Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu of the Five Elements Sect disciples all sighed, watching Luo Tian. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to dare kill under the eyes of an Xuanling late-stage powerhouse.

"I yield!" Feng Qianyu said softly. It was said that he never valued his life, but this was a metaphor. However, Luo Tian truly didn't value his own life.

Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei watched Luo Tian with concern, sensing that he now seemed like a sheep among wolves.

"Stupid boy!" Lei Yong stomped his foot and instantly appeared in front of Luo Tian, slapping the ground with both hands.

"Crash!"

A dull sound echoed.

Under Lei Yong's intervention, the crack that had reached Luo Tian's feet disappeared. Lei Yong took a few steps back.

Ji Chen also appeared in front of Luo Tian, his eyes cold as he looked around at the Feiyun Sect disciples. The sky had already darkened, and Ji Chen's body seemed to merge into the night, only his two eyes like wolves watching around.

Nangong Xiu saw the two standing in front of Luo Tian and his eyes narrowed. His face remained gloomy, his Xuanling late-stage aura surging toward the three brothers.

"Master Nangong, have you heard of the Five Elements Sect's Dan Pavilion Zhang Daotian lineage?" Lei Yong smiled and shouted loudly.

"Buzz..." When Nangong Xiu heard Lei Yong's words, the aura he had directed toward them suddenly stopped.

Nangong Xiu's face became even more gloomy. His teeth clenched, and a figure of an old man appeared in his mind. He finally suppressed his anger and growled: "Go... today is over. If there's another time, even if you are his disciples, you won't be able to leave easily!"

"Who is Zhang Daotian?" The Feiyun Sect disciples murmured the name.

The Five Elements Sect disciples were also surprised. Zhang Daotian, some of them knew it was the former headmaster of the Dan Pavilion. But they hadn't expected this former Dan Pavilion head to have such power that even an Xuanling late-stage powerhouse would back down upon hearing his name!

Luo Tian was also surprised. When Nangong Xiu's aura pressed toward them, he knew they wouldn't die because there was no killing intent in Nangong Xiu's aura. However, seeing the furious Nangong Xiu, he knew they wouldn't be safe either.

But unexpectedly, Lei Yong only mentioned his teacher's name and Nangong Xiu stopped. This made Luo Tian admire his master. Just by mentioning the name, an Xuanling Realm powerhouse dared not act. How terrifying must his master's cultivation be? This made Luo Tian even more yearn for power.

"Please, Master Nangong, hand over Li Xiuping. This matter can finally be concluded," Lei Yong said after Nangong Xiu had somewhat calmed down.

"I said don't push it too far!" Nangong Xiu sneered. Though he was郁闷, his spiritual sense covered the entire Feiyun Sect to find the culprit who had caused such a mess.

His spiritual sense spread out, and soon the state of the Feiyun Sect appeared in Nangong Xiu's mind.

However, at the moment Nangong Xiu's spiritual sense spread out, in Li Xiuping's room at the back of the Feiyun Sect, a black-cloaked figure with closed eyes suddenly opened his eyes and flashed two cold glares. He muttered, "No good, retreat!"

In the room, there were several people who were looking at a black pearl hovering above them. It looked similar to the Killing Aura Pearl formed in Luo Tian's body, but different was that it radiated an evil aura. If someone were careful, they would notice blood-red energy constantly flowing from the ground into the pearl.

This scene did not escape Nangong Xiu's spiritual sense. Seeing the pearl hovering above them, Nangong Xiu's face suddenly turned pale.

The black-cloaked figure who had sensed Nangong Xiu's spiritual sense quickly packed up the pearl and pressed down on the ground. A wave of array energy spread out.

"Trying to escape!" Nangong Xiu fiercely swung his hand, and a massive palm like Mount Tai pressed down instantly over Li Xiuping's room, crashing down.

"Boom..." A deafening explosion echoed. The entire Feiyun Mountain trembled three times, and Li Xiuping's house was reduced to ruins. Even surrounding houses collapsed.

Nangong Xiu and the earth dragon's figures disappeared from their original place, appearing above Li Xiuping's house. But there was no one left.

" They escaped!" Nangong Xiu said with a gloomy face, looking at the destroyed array on the ground. His eyes showed concern.

Luo Tian and Lei Yong's figures also appeared at this place. Nangong Xiu slowly descended.

"What's wrong, Master Nangong? Did Li Xiuping escape?" Lei Yong's voice carried a mocking tone, looking at Nangong Xiu with contempt.

Nangong Xiu knew what Lei Yong was thinking. His face became even gloomier.

Luo Tian had killed Deng Jiusi under his eyes, and he could say it was a mistake. But Li Xiuping and those black-cloaked figures escaping under his eyes—how could he explain it? Nangong Xiu felt this was the most humiliating day of his life.

"Have you seen any black-cloaked figures with a moon emblem on their collars?" Nangong Xiu quickly remembered the main issue, ignoring his embarrassment and asked softly.

"Ah, Master Nangong, let him escape. We can find him again later. You don't need to feel guilty!" Lei Yong mocked again.

Hearing Lei Yong's words, Nangong Xiu's face turned red. Especially that line about an Xuanling Realm powerhouse, making his face turn as red as eggplant. He almost wanted to speak but had no words.

Others heard Nangong Xiu's words, thinking he was just making an excuse for letting Li Xiuping escape.

But Luo Tian heard Nangong Xiu's words and felt a flicker in his heart. He involuntarily recalled the black-cloaked figure who had rescued Li Xiuping.

"Late Master, I have seen one!" Luo Tian could feel Nangong Xiu's concern and spoke softly.

Chapter 110: The Appearance of the Tianshi Sect

"Oh? Tell me more!" Nangong Xiu, hearing Luo Tian had seen it, ignored the mocking glances around him and looked at Luo Tian with a serious face.

"At that time, it was chaotic. Everyone was fighting. I had been chasing Li Xiuping all the time. When I found Li Xiuping and wanted to kill him, a black-cloaked figure at the early stage of Hua Gu suddenly appeared and saved him! I was in a haze then, so I didn't notice if the black-cloaked figure had a moon emblem on their collar!"

Luo Tian spoke softly.

After hearing Luo Tian's account, Lei Yong and Ji Chen also showed serious expressions. They thought again of the two black-cloaked figures with moon emblems in Xuantian City and Li Xiuping's use of the spiritual energy control technique and corpse-control talismans.

After hearing Luo Tian's account, Nangong Xiu also described the scene he had seen with his spiritual sense to Lei Yong and others.

After hearing Nangong Xiu's words, especially seeing the look of fear on his face, everyone felt a shadow over their hearts.

"If I'm not mistaken, the pearl they absorbed blood-aura energy is a Soul-Refining Pearl! And these people are the Tianshi Sect, which has been absent from Tianyuan Continent for a long time!"

Nangong Xiu's face was dark, almost dripping with water. He felt uneasy about the Tianshi Sect's presence in the Feiyun Sect.

When people heard Nangong Xiu mention the Tianshi Sect, their faces changed. The Tianshi Sect was a name that represented destruction. Since the Tianshi Sect's peak was annihilated by various sects, it had been low-key. But low-key didn't mean it wouldn't appear. History on the Tianyuan Continent recorded several times when the Tianshi Sect had appeared, but each time it was exterminated. However, every appearance meant a bloody storm on the Tianyuan Continent.

"Is it possible that the Tianshi Sect is appearing again?" Lei Yong asked softly. This matter was too significant, possibly even drawing out the old monsters of the Five Elements Sect.

"I originally had a 50% chance to guess these black-cloaked figures were from the Tianshi Sect. But after hearing your accounts, I now have an 80% chance they are the Tianshi Sect. From all signs, it's certain these people are from the Tianshi Sect!" Nangong Xiu said confidently.

"Master Nangong, this matter is significant. We should return to the Five Elements Sect immediately and report it. I'll take my leave!" Lei Yong, hearing Nangong Xiu's certainty, also had a serious face and wanted to return to the Five Elements Sect immediately.

"Indeed. Usually, the Tianshi Sect acts secretly, but this time they've been so bold, taking advantage of our two sects' battle to collect blood-aura energy. This must be different from before!" Nangong Xiu said lowly.

Although the Feiyun Sect was a second-rate sect, it was still much weaker than the Five Elements Sect. If the Tianshi Sect truly appeared, only a sect like the Five Elements Sect could counter it. A second-rate sect's resistance against the Tianshi Sect was just a joke.

After Lei Yong and others spoke, they bowed to Nangong Xiu and walked down the mountain of Feiyun. Nangong Xiu instructed the elders to clean up the battlefield, as the Feiyun Sect had suffered heavy losses. Not only did they lose disciples, but nearly a quarter of their Bone-Transformation elders had died, not to mention the injured. The Feiyun Sect was in dire need of recovery.

Looking at the front gate of the Feiyun Sect, Nangong Xiu felt his heart bleeding. But soon he noticed something was wrong. Normally, the dead would produce a faint death qi.

However, this battle's Feiyun Sect disciples had no death qi at all. Their bodies were withered, not resembling those who had just died but rather people who had been dead for a long time.

"This technique can only be achieved by the Tianshi Sect's Soul-Refining Pearl!" Nangong Xiu muttered softly, his certainty deepening that these people were definitely from the Tianshi Sect.

...

At the edge of Dahan Forest, where few people lived, spiritual energy fluctuations spread. A flash of light appeared—several black-cloaked figures had arrived at the edge of Dahan Forest. These were the same black-cloaked figures who had escaped from Nangong Xiu.

"Spit..." Several black-cloaked figures landed and immediately spat blood, clearly suffering from serious injuries.

"Nangong Xiu! Indeed, he's an Xuanling late-stage powerhouse. If we hadn't reacted quickly, we would have been left there!" An old black-cloaked man said with admiration.

"Still, the Grand Elder's cultivation is unparalleled. At early Xuanling stage, otherwise we wouldn't have escaped!" Another young black-cloaked man said respectfully.

Others heard someone leading the way and followed suit, with a continuous flow of flattery.

"But this time's gains were considerable. Fortune favors the bold. The spiritual energy of these cultivators was much stronger than that of commoners. Killing several cities didn't compare to a few Feiyun Sect disciples. My Soul-Refining Pearl has already matured, hahaha!" The old black-cloaked man enjoyed the flattery and felt pleased with his gains.

"Once the Grand Elder's Soul-Refining Pearl is fully matured, I'm sure Nangong Xiu won't be a match for the Grand Elder!" A disciple continued to flatter.

"Of course. Once my Soul-Refining Pearl is fully matured, I'll reach the middle Xuanling stage. Then my resources from the sect will increase. With the Soul-Refining Pearl, even an Xuanling late-stage powerhouse won't be a threat to me!" The old black-cloaked man said dismissively, forgetting how he had been chased like a dog by Nangong Xiu.

But Li Xiuping's face showed respect, though no one noticed the hint of contempt in his eyes.

"Li Xiuping, you've done great. How about this time you have no place to go? Would you consider joining our Tianshi Sect?" The old black-cloaked man asked Li Xiuping, clearly attracted by his dual-element body. If it weren't for that, he might have let Li Xiuping be left to his fate in the Feiyun Sect.

"I am willing to join the Tianshi Sect and sacrifice myself for the Grand Elder!" Li Xiuping said respectfully.

Hearing Li Xiuping's words, the black-cloaked elder smiled in satisfaction and waved his hand for Li Xiuping to rise.

But no one noticed that the black-cloaked elder turned around, his face showing coldness and a deep, sinister expression.

"We still need to kill several cities. Once my Soul-Refining Pearl is fully matured, I'll be able to achieve it! Next, we should act more discreetly. I estimate the Feiyun Sect and Five Elements Sect have already known we are from the Tianshi Sect. We can only target small cities now!" The black-cloaked elder whispered to the others.

"Yes, all listen to the Grand Elder's instructions!" The black-cloaked figures, including Li Xiuping, all answered loudly.

After speaking, under the black-cloaked elder's leadership, their dark figures disappeared at the edge of Dahan Forest.

Chapter 111: Returning to Feiyun

The Feiyun Sect was originally a top-tier second-rate sect. After Luo Tian and others arrived, the mountain gate outside the sect was in ruins, with a sorrowful atmosphere throughout the sect.

After one night of cleaning up, nearly a thousand Feiyun Sect disciples' corpses had been dealt with. The sect's disciples were heavily injured, and nearly twenty elders had died in yesterday's battle, especially the late-stage Bone-Transformation Grand Elder Deng Jiusi's death had greatly weakened the Feiyun Sect.

At this moment, a thin-faced youth appeared at the foot of the Feiyun Sect's mountain and slowly walked toward the mountain gate.
