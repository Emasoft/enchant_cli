“Welcome back!” Luo Xiong, Jiang Nanxuan and others who remained on the Tianyuan Continent smiled as they addressed Elder Xuanbing.

“Go!” Luo Tian, Zheng Xin, Xu Liyi and others ignored the merger matters, returning to their respective residences to heal.

“Hum…” Luo Tian appeared in his room, gazing at the surroundings with a bittersweet expression, his face softening.

“Finally done! I'll find you all soon and bring you back!” Luo Tian smiled faintly, murmuring with a tone of affection. He then sat cross-legged, his body emitting a series of thunderous rumbles.

While Luo Tian and others returned, the people of the Tianyuan Continent and Seven Star Island were busy merging. Meanwhile, some bold cultivators dared to enter the Mortal Domain.

“This…” People soon saw the nearly shattered starry sky of the Mortal Domain, with swirling void currents bursting from fissures like ravines, radiating an unsettling aura.

The entire Mortal Domain had no living beings, yet people knew the terrifying battle that had erupted between both factions.

Soon, the news of the Phoenix Clan's annihilation spread like a storm across the Nine Domains, shaking them. Everyone was stunned by the Four Sacred Star Domains' power, no longer the weakest among the Nine.

Though the Phoenix Clan was one of the Eight Sacred Clans of the Beast Domain, it was the strongest among them. Its independence made it a true sacred clan.

Then, another revelation surfaced: the Phoenix Clan had colluded with Ming Zhenyan, one of the nine sacred elders who escaped from the Mortal Domain. Now at the peak of the era, and also the son of the Ming Clan's king, Ming Huan.

The peak of the era was a godlike presence in the Nine Domains, with no one reaching that level among the sacred sects. A king's son alone was enough to terrify people. They knew that the ancient kings' offspring were on par with the human race's era masters, and their strength was self-evident.

People were angry yet more awed by the Four Sacred Star Domains' might. If such a clan could be eradicated, and even Ming Zhenyan and Ming Huan escaped, it proved the Four Sacred Star Domains' terrifying power—perhaps even capable of annihilating sacred sects.

All the sacred sects fell silent, no voices emerging, plunging the Nine Domains into a period of peace.

A month later, Luo Tian and others sat in the grand hall, their faces filled with joy. In a month, everyone's injuries had fully recovered.

"Damn it, finally vented our anger! They got what was coming!" Zheng Xin and Gu Lei shouted.

"Yes, they'll probably be more obedient for a while. I should go do what I need to!" Luo Tian surveyed the group, speaking softly.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, people fell silent, their gazes turning to him, awaiting his next move.

"I'm going to find Qianxue!" Luo Tian spoke softly, a hint of apology in his voice. He should have sought them immediately upon returning, but he had delayed for over two months.

"Go on, what are you waiting for!" Xu Liyi was the first to speak, looking at Luo Qingqing beside him with a bitter smile. These past days, Xu Liyi had exhausted all his accumulated energy and could no longer compose poetry.

Gu Lei and Zheng Xin also eagerly anticipated accompanying Luo Tian on the journey.

"Dad, I'll go with you!" Luo Li spoke to Luo Tian, his eyes filled with longing.

"Master, I'll accompany you!" Dong Yichen's face lit up with excitement, eager to follow Luo Tian.

"Alright, I know what to do," Luo Tian said, smiling at the loud voices.

"The Four Sacred Star Domains can't be left unguarded. This time, I'll take a few people with me," Luo Tian shook his head gently, scanning the group.

"Senior Sun, come with me!" Luo Tian called out to Sun Keinian first. He was entering the Nine Perilous Lands, likely facing many great tombs. Sun Keinian was a tomb-robbing expert and would be invaluable, especially with Yang Yu in his possession. Together, they could solve most problems.

"Good! It's been a while since I last fought. I'll also look for Sima Tuo, that bastard. I wonder if he's dead by now!" Sun Keinian's eyes gleamed, nodding in agreement.

"Li'er, come with me!" Luo Tian turned to Luo Li, his eyes softening. His son had a unique sensitivity to space and exceptional escape skills.

"Zimo, Yichen, come with me!" Luo Tian then addressed his two disciples, speaking softly. He wanted to guide them on the journey.

"Alright, there's one more person—someone will arrive shortly! Once they do, we'll depart!" Luo Tian spoke softly, leaving everyone disappointed.

"Master, master, I want to go too!" Dong Yan'er appeared before Luo Tian, grabbing his arm and shaking it playfully.

"Stop fooling around!" Luo Tian lightly patted Dong Yan'er's head, speaking softly: "Stay here and wait for us to return!"

"Little girl, don't bother us anymore!" A laugh echoed through the hall as a figure in purple robes, Biao Dedu, entered with a smile.

"Damn it, it's him! I won't go! Luo Tian, why did you bring a dog instead of us? You're discriminating against humans!" Seeing Biao Dedu enter, Zheng Xin and others erupted in chaos.

Chapter 1408: Departure to the Thunder Domain ()

"Damn it, I'm not a dog!" Biao Dedu's confident face turned indignant upon hearing their complaints, but he was no match for Zheng Xin and the others' united resistance. In a verbal battle, Biao Dedu was swiftly subdued.

The younger generation watched in awe as these elders acted so recklessly, stunned by their antics.

"Luo Tian, let me go! I might be of use!" Wan Lingkong stepped forward from the crowd, gazing at Luo Tian.

"Hmm," Luo Tian considered Wan Lingkong's abilities before nodding in agreement. His mastery of formations was undeniable.

"Alright, stop arguing! My decision is final. If anything's needed, I'll contact you!" Luo Tian concluded, finalizing the group.

Their current strength was among the top in the Nine Domains, but some places required more than just power.

The Nine Perilous Lands each had their own dangers, but Luo Tian didn't want too many people risking their lives. As for Luo Li, Dong Yichen, and Zimo, he wouldn't let them venture into the perilous lands but instead have them wait at the periphery.

"Alas…" The group sighed deeply, especially the younger ones, who looked at Luo Li and the others with envy. In their generation, Luo Tian was a legend; they had grown up hearing his tales and couldn't help but revere him.

"Luo Tian, you can't favor one over the others! Take my son along!" Zheng Xin spoke first, dragging Zheng Tianyao forward and kicking him toward Luo Tian.

"Yes, brother-in-law! If you don't take me, at least take your nephew to gain some experience!" Gu Lei kicked his son toward Luo Tian.

"Master!" Dong Yan'er's face showed委屈, her eyes glistening with tears as she looked at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian felt a headache; taking these kids along would surely be chaotic, but seeing the threatening glances from Zheng Xin and others, he finally nodded.

"Alas… Qingqing, if you had agreed earlier, we might have had a son together!" Xu Liyi sighed, watching the kids being handed over to Luo Tian.

"Rubbish! I don't want to have a child? You blame the land for not yielding crops?" Luo Qingqing snapped, her eyes blazing.

"This…" The group was speechless, watching the fierce Luo Qingqing. Even Zheng Xin's wife, Dan Yuyan, who was known for her fierceness, blushed.

"Senior Sister Qingqing, you truly are admirable!" Zheng Xin said with admiration, gazing at Luo Qingqing.

"Go on, go on!" Luo Tian was terrified of these people; if he stayed longer, more might tag along.

Luo Tian stood up, with Biao Dedu, Sun Keinian, and Wan Lingkong by his side. Accompanied by the excited younger generation, they flew beyond the Tianyuan Continent.

"Be careful, Tianyao! If danger arises, run—don't worry about your master, he won't die!" Zheng Xin shouted at them.

"Your mother!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly, glancing back at Zheng Xin before vanishing from the sight of the Tianyuan Continent's people.

"Where to first?" As soon as they left the Tianyuan Continent, Sun Keinian asked, his eyes gleaming with excitement.

"Thunder Sea Marshes!" Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing toward the Thunder Domain and revealing his plan.

Luo Tian had confirmed that Dugu Qianxue and the others weren't at the Broken God Cliff. The Infinite Flame Sea had no sign of them either, as Xiaoqi hadn't seen them.

As for the Fallen Dragon Valley, Luo Tian felt an inexplicable dread and didn't want to go there first. Other Perilous Lands were in different domains, inevitably encountering other sacred sects.

The Thunder Domain had many factions, but none were true sacred sects—this avoided encounters with them.

To avoid attention, the group altered their appearances and flew toward the Thunder Domain.

Along the way, Luo Tian guided the young ones' cultivation, imparting his martial arts to each based on their strengths.

The youths' talents were remarkable. Luo Li especially amazed Luo Tian; his son's potential was undeniable, and with refinement, his future achievements would be extraordinary. Dong Yichen, though not initially promising, had followed Luo Tian and Xiang Tianming's path perfectly, making him the ideal heir.

Zimo was deep and contemplative, likely shaped by years of combat—she was the most diligent among them.

Zheng Xin's son differed from Zheng Xin; while Zheng Xin excelled in speed, Zheng Tianyao was brutally strong.

Gu Lei's son mirrored Gu Lei's personality—playful yet secretly mischievous.

Three days passed swiftly, and the group arrived at the Thunder Domain, immediately feeling a violent aura.

"Master, may I go find someone?" Upon entering the Thunder Domain, Zimo's face showed an unusual shyness as he addressed Luo Tian.

"Hmm?" Seeing Zimo's shyness, the group was surprised; they hadn't expected Zimo to be shy.

"Haha, Uncle, you don't know—Zimo was tricked by the Phoenix Clan and fled to the Thunder Domain. He was saved by someone, and they… you know what I mean!" Gu Guanyu laughed, addressing Luo Tian. The younger generation had grown up together, and due to their elders' relationships, they were very close.

"Oh?" Luo Tian's eyes held a smile as he slapped Gu Guanyu's head: "Look at Zimo, you should hurry up too!"

"Go on, Uncle will accompany you to see which girl's family will finalize the marriage!" Luo Tian spoke to Zimo, his voice carrying a smile.

Zimo was his disciple; he had only given him a set of techniques before leaving, and now felt some guilt. These days, he had been most attentive to Zimo. Since Zimo and his sister were parentless, Luo Tian felt it was his duty to replace their parents.

"It's a small sect called Snow Dragon Mountain!"

"Master, I can go alone and then find you!" Zimo's face was embarrassed as he spoke to Luo Tian, feeling awkward about delaying the group.

"Go on, lead the way! It won't take long!" Luo Tian spoke softly, smiling and patting Zimo's shoulder.

"Okay," Zimo nodded firmly, his eyes showing a rare softness as he thought of the girl from years ago.

The group followed Zimo toward the continent where Snow Dragon Mountain was located.

Cold Sky Continent's largest sect was Cold Sky Sect, while Snow Dragon Mountain was a first-rate sect. Luo Tian had never heard of it, but he had heard of Cold Sky Sect, though he didn't know its sect master. After all, the Thunder Domain's strength was mixed.

After a day of flying, they arrived at Cold Sky Continent. Upon entering, the violent aura disappeared, replaced by an intense coldness.

"Ah! This Cold Sky Continent is nice. The sect master of Cold Sky Sect has the strength of the early era!" As they entered, Sun Keinian muttered, sensing a venerable old man seated on a vast snow mountain.

"Yes, it's good," Luo Tian nodded slightly, recognizing the old man; he had been among those who surrounded the Tianyuan Continent during the Nine Domains' gathering.

"Let's not disturb them. Once Zimo's marriage is arranged, we'll leave!" Luo Tian spoke to the group, concealing their auras to avoid detection by the old man.

Zimo's face was filled with excitement as he led Luo Tian and the others toward the vast snow mountain. He looked tense.

"Snow Dragon Sect!" Luo Tian saw the three large characters carved on the snow mountain's gate, smiling slightly. His eyes narrowed as he patted Zimo's shoulder: "Go on, enter."

"Okay," Zimo stepped forward toward the Snow Dragon Sect's gate, bowing to the guards: "Please inform them that Zimo from the Four Sacred Star Domains wishes to see Li Qian'nan."

"You are?" Two gate guards looked at Luo Tian's group, their eyes flashing. Though they had altered their appearances and concealed their cultivation levels, the aura of these figures was enough to make them feel pressure.

Snow Dragon Sect wasn't well-known in the Nine Domains, but it had strength on Cold Sky Continent. These two guards had been guarding for five years, seeing many people come and go. Yet even the sect master of Cold Sky Sect didn't have the aura these four possessed.

"Wait a moment!" The two guards hesitated, exchanged glances, then flew into the mountain.

"Zimo Senior, it's so cold out here! Why are you sweating? Don't worry, we'll handle it!" Gu Guanyu smiled, placing a hand on Zimo's shoulder.

"Little bastard, you talk too much! You're just like your father!" Biao Dedu kicked Gu Guanyu away, smiling and patting Zimo's shoulder: "Don't worry, Uncle is here. Back then, if it weren't for me, your master wouldn't have found his wife!"

"Uncle Biao, tell us more!" The younger generation was drawn in, their faces showing curiosity as they surrounded Biao Dedu.

Chapter 1409: No One Can Do It ()

"I'll tell you, back then Luo Tian was just like Zimo now—nervous around your wife!" Biao Dedu started to speak, but felt a chill on his neck and shivered.

"Sorry, we're not here!" As Biao Dedu's words ended, a guard emerged and addressed Zimo.

"Not here?" Zimo's face showed disappointment, then asked: "Do you know where she went?"

"Don't… don't know…" The guard stammered, causing the group's faces to show confusion.

"Oh, then you all go first! I'll wait here!" Zimo's face showed determination, recalling the promise.

"You're still that terrifying Zimo, aren't you? You act like a fool! This is clearly suspicious!" Gu Guanyu approached again, speaking to Zimo.

"Hmm?" Zimo frowned slightly and stared into the guard's eyes, his gaze sharp.

In an instant, the guard's face turned pale, as if seeing a battlefield of corpses, his body cold and trembling like being watched by a ghost.

"Buzz…" Zimo's vast spiritual sense spread out, his current strength at the peak of the sacred realm. The scene of Snow Dragon Sect appeared in his mind.

In a moment, Zimo found the woman he longed for and his face showed疯狂 (madness), his eyes turning into a cold, icy pool.

In his spiritual sense, a woman in white robes sat in an ice cave, her face pale. Cold air surged from the cave, striking her body and penetrating it, making her tremble but with unwavering determination.

"Xue Nan, please agree! Cold Sky Sect is the major sect of Cold Sky Continent. Master Cold Sky has early era strength. We can't afford to offend them! I had no choice, and she saved Zimo. For so many years, he never came back to see you—clearly, he's forgotten you!" A middle-aged man spoke.

" He'll come, father! Don't force me!" The woman trembled, exhaling white mist.

"Zimo, recently the Four Sacred Star Domains' Luo Tian has a disciple named Zimo. But there are many people named Zimo in the world. At that time, he was so injured, it's impossible for him to be Luo Tian's disciple. If he truly were Luo Tian's disciple, I wouldn't have opposed it; even Cold Sky Sect wouldn't dare say anything!" The middle-aged man spoke, his voice carrying a hint of helplessness.

"Anyway, that guy won't come back. You'll suffer for a few more days. I don't want to do this, but for Snow Dragon Sect, I can't help it!" The middle-aged man saw the woman's unwavering determination and sneered, turning his back to leave.

"Seven days from now is your wedding day. You won't have a choice!" The middle-aged man's voice echoed in the cave, making the woman tremble again.

"Come quickly! I can't hold on much longer!" The woman's voice trembled, her body appearing unusually thin in the ice.

"Boom…" Zimo's eyes turned blood-red as he strode toward Snow Dragon Sect's gate.

"What are you doing!" The two gate guards looked terrified, sensing Zimo's terrifying presence but still trying to block him.

"Boom… Boom…" The next moment, their bodies collapsed, colliding with the massive gate and spitting blood.

"Move aside, don't force me to kill you!" Zimo's voice was cold as he pushed the gate open and stepped into Snow Dragon Sect.

"Haha, there's a show!" Gu Guanyu and others smiled, following Zimo. With Luo Tian and the four accompanying them, no one in the Nine Domains could touch them.

Luo Tian, Biao Dedu, Sun Keinian, and Wan Lingkong smiled as they followed the younger generation into Snow Dragon Sect.

Their years of experience made them notice Snow Dragon Sect's situation upon entering, but they didn't tell Zimo. They wanted to see how he would handle it.

"Boom…" The appearance of Zimo, radiating blood qi, instantly shook Snow Dragon Sect. At the peak of the sacred realm, he was formidable; Snow Dragon Sect had only its sect master, Li Xuelong, at the threshold of the era, and two elders at the peak of the sacred realm.

With one step, Zimo instantly appeared outside the ice cave where Li Qian'nan was imprisoned. His face bore a cold glint, no hesitation as he punched.

"Boom… Boom…" The thunderous sound echoed through Snow Dragon Sect, a cold barrier forming in front of Zimo, emitting crackling sounds.

"Open!" Zimo's face showed madness as he punched again, the cold barrier shattering with a loud crash. Li Qian'nan looked confused as she sat inside.

"Nan Nan!" Zimo instantly appeared before Li Qian'nan, hugging her cold body in his arms. His aura of violence disappeared instantly.

"Zimo!" Li Qian'nan immediately recognized Zimo, tears flowing down her cheeks as they turned into droplets of ice on the ground.

"I'm sorry I came too late!" Zimo's voice carried guilt as he channeled his sacred power into Li Qian'nan.

"Ah, the iron-hearted Zimo Senior has this side too!" Gu Guanyu and others smiled, watching the couple embrace and sighed.

"Hmph! Who are you? How dare you barge into our Snow Dragon Sect!" A deep voice echoed behind them, making Zimo and Li Qian'nan separate and step out of the ice cave.

"Dad! He's here for me!" Li Qian'nan's face was still pale but had a hint of redness as she addressed Li Xuelong.

A group of figures stood behind Li Xuelong, two elders at the peak of the sacred realm frowned as they looked at Zimo and the others. They felt a sense of danger from them, especially Luo Tian's group, who seemed unfathomable.

"Respect for the father-in-law!" Zimo was angry at Li Xuelong's treatment of Li Qian'nan but still addressed him respectfully.

"Are you the one from before?" Li Xuelong's eyes deepened as he looked at Zimo, who appeared young. He was shocked by Zimo's peak sacred realm strength. At such a young age, his power was rare in the Nine Domains; if he didn't die early, his future achievements would be boundless.

"Who are these people?" Li Xuelong then noticed Gu Guanyu and the others, each a prodigy.

Everyone except Zimo had concealed their true faces. Plus, Li Xuelong didn't recognize Zimo and hadn't thought of Luo Tian, but he knew they weren't ordinary.

"Father-in-law, I've come to propose!" Zimo spoke directly, making Li Xuelong's face change again.

"You! Impossible!" Li Xuelong thought of his recent agreement with Cold Sky Sect and coldly snorted, his voice icy as he looked at Zimo—this boy had made his daughter lose her mind and ignore his advice.

"Old man, I'll tell you, Zimo Senior's proposal is a great fortune for you. If you don't agree, you'll regret it for life!" Gu Guanyu scoffed at Li Xuelong.

"Junior, your elders haven't spoken yet; what are you talking about!" Li Xuelong's face turned cold at Gu Guanyu's words, his voice carrying chill.

"Your elders also think the same!" Biao Dedu spoke with equal disdain to Li Xuelong.

"Your daughter doesn't want to marry anyone else, wanting to rely on her daughter to climb the tree of Cold Sky Sect. How high your aspirations are!" Biao Dedu mocked, making Li Xuelong's face turn even colder.

"This is Snow Dragon Sect; you can't come here to cause trouble! Our sect isn't big, but it's not something anyone can bully!" Li Xuelong's face finally turned cold as he felt Biao Dedu's audacity, his threshold of the era power radiating, pressing upon them.

"Ha! I'm scared!" Gu Guanyu seemed unaffected and spoke again.

"Gu Guanyu, don't cause trouble!" But before Gu Guanyu could finish speaking, Zimo stopped him and turned to Li Xuelong.

"Father-in-law, whatever I can do, I will!" Zimo's face showed respect.

"Impossible! What are you? Unless you're the Zimo from the Four Sacred Star Domains, Luo Tian's disciple, you two can't!" Li Xuelong sneered at Zimo.

"Haha!" Hearing Li Xuelong's words, Gu Guanyu and Dong Yichen laughed heartily. Even Dong Yan'er smiled lightly, leaving Li Xuelong and Snow Dragon Sect's people confused.

"Father-in-law, my master is indeed Luo Tian!" Zimo looked toward Luo Tian's direction, speaking softly with respect.

"Haha! He's Luo Tian? I'm his grandfather!" Li Xuelong mocked, but before he could finish speaking, a white hand slapped his face. Though the force wasn't great, the sound was loud and left a clear palm print on his face.

"Are you taking advantage of me?" A youthful voice spoke, Luo Li's face showing coldness as he looked at Li Xuelong.

"Old man, who are you calling grandfather?" Zheng Xin and other junior strongmen looked angry at Li Xuelong.

Even though Li Xuelong was a threshold of the era powerhouse, he was stunned by these young people. Then recalling his identity and cultivation level, being slapped by a child made his face turn grim.

"Father-in-law, please apologize to my master!" Zimo's respectful demeanor finally turned grim but remained polite.

"Apologize? Why? What are you people? Bragging about your strength, coming to cause trouble here. Speak up, who are you? If not, I'll replace your elders and teach you a lesson!"

"Don't say you're Luo Tian and Zimo. If Luo Tian is truly Luo Tian, he wouldn't be the one proposing; I'd be on my knees begging you to marry!" Li Xuelong's face showed disdain as he addressed Luo Tian's group, but no killing intent. He could sense their identities weren't ordinary—definitely disciples or elders of major forces.

"…"

Luo Tian's group were speechless, looking at Li Xuelong's grim face before laughing.

"Master Li, are you sure about your words?" Biao Dedu's face showed amusement as he addressed Li Xuelong.

"Of course I am! The hero of the Nine Domains, kneeling once won't hurt. Since I'm in a good mood now, leave quickly! If you don't, I might just fight!" Li Xuelong's face was cold and hadn't detected Luo Tian's group's cultivation.

"Sorry, I'm Luo Tian!" Luo Tian waved his hand across his face, looking at Li Xuelong with amusement.

"Quickly…" Before Li Xuelong could finish speaking, he was stunned, looking at Luo Tian standing there. He couldn't speak.

"How is that possible!" Everyone in Snow Dragon Sect was stunned, looking at Luo Tian with disbelief. They never imagined the legendary invincible prodigy Luo Tian would appear in Snow Dragon Sect, standing before them. Who was Luo Tian to them? He was impossibly high, how could he have any connection with them.

"This…" Even Li Qian'nan by Zimo's side looked shocked, she hadn't expected that this Zimo was truly Luo Tian's disciple.

"Haha! You kids, who are you really? Daring to impersonate Luo Tian!" Stunned, Li Xuelong's face turned icy as he looked at Luo Tian.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly, feeling无奈 (helpless), seeing Li Xuelong's disbelief. He knew this Li Xuelong wouldn't believe he was truly Luo Tian.

In fact, without Zimo, Luo Tian might have never had any connection with Snow Dragon Sect. It was normal for them to disbelieve him.

But Luo Tian felt uneasy; since returning to the Four Sacred Star Domains, first Luo Li didn't recognize him, then Zhu Ge Jie had tried to kill him under the pretense of not being Luo Tian.

"Why do they always make me prove I'm myself!" Luo Tian's eyes showed helplessness as he looked at Li Xuelong.

"Then how do I prove I'm Luo Tian!" Luo Tian shook his head, then his aura gradually rose, emitting a series of pressures.

"Father-in-law, I've come to visit you!" Just as Luo Tian's aura rose slightly, a playful voice echoed from outside Snow Dragon Sect. Several long red streaks descended from the sky, landing before Luo Tian's group without looking at them.

The leader was a young man in white fur coat, his face thin and eyes lifeless, bowing symbolically to Li Xuelong.

"Ah, it's Yu Letian, my nephew!" Seeing the young man, Li Xuelong's eyes flashed with disdain but then showed a different expression from when he saw Luo Tian.

"Ah, Nan Nan has left the ice cave! Has she changed her mind?" Yu Letian then saw Li Qian'nan standing with Zimo, his eyes flashing with light as he approached her.

Upon seeing the young man, Li Qian'nan's eyes showed fear, her body trembling as she leaned closer to Zimo and grabbed his hand.

Zimo didn't hesitate, holding Li Qian'nan's hand with one hand and pulling her closer to his chest. His eyes were cold as he looked at Yu Letian, declaring his possession.

Zimo was very upset; Li Qian'nan had suffered too much because of him, and since he arrived here, Li Xuelong had treated him coldly. Even when he brought up his master Luo Tian, Li Xuelong still didn't believe him.

If it were in the Beast Domain, Zimo would have already attacked, but since he was Li Qian'nan's father, he couldn't.

This Yu Letian had just called Li Qian'nan "Nan Nan," a term only close people used.

"Who are you!" Before Zimo could speak, Yu Letian's face turned icy with killing intent as he looked at Zimo.

"Blind? Of course, she's my wife!" Gu Guanyu shouted, his voice carrying disdain.

Yu Letian's cultivation was good—early sacred realm—but that was just good enough for them.

"Take your dirty hands off, or I'll regret bringing you into this world!" Yu Letian looked at the two holding hands and was instantly ignited with jealousy, his eyes burning with greed.

"Leave…!" Hearing Yu Letian's blunt words, Zimo's face turned icy and he sneered.

"Crash…" In an instant, a cold aura enveloped Yu Letian, making his face pale and as if surrounded by countless ghosts, falling into an endless abyss.

"Crack… Crack…" Yu Letian's teeth chattered, and he fell to the ground, his eyes filled with fear as he looked at Zimo.

"Don't kill me, don't kill me!" Yu Letian cried out, making the people accompanying him turn pale and rush to his side.

"Hmph!" Li Xuelong's voice echoed, pulling Yu Letian back to reality. His pale face was still breathing heavily, and his grimace returned.

"Father-in-law, what's happening!" Yu Letian didn't go to Zimo but turned to Li Xuelong.

"Qian'nan, come here!" Li Xuelong shouted at Li Qian'nan.

"Father-in-law, you really want to let Nan Nan marry this trash?" Zimo's face showed anger as he looked at Li Xuelong.

"Trash, who are you calling trash!" Hearing Zimo's words, Yu Letian, supported by Li Xuelong, became arrogant again.

"I'm sorry, I'm not targeting anyone. I just want to say, all of you are trash!" Zimo gently released Li Qian'nan's hand and stepped toward Yu Letian.
