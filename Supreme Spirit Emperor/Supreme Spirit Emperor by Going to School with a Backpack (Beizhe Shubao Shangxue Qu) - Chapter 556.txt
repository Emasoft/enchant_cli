At the very moment Luo Tian and his companions burst forth, an overwhelming sword intent erupted from behind Luo Tian. This sword intent swept across the eight directions, causing the entire Beast Ghost King City's forces to feel it—not as a human sensation, but as an awareness of the sword itself. Almost instantly, every sword within the Beast Ghost King势力 trembled, regardless of their rank, with their tips pointing directly toward the Tiansha City. "What has happened to cause my sword to tremble?" all sword masters exclaimed in astonishment, their gazes filled with awe. "It must be the emergence of an ultimate凶剑!" In the Luo family courtyard, Luo Shui held two long swords in his hands—Qiu Shui Sword and Youlong Sword—both trembling uncontrollably. "Where is it?" The Beast Ghost King leapt into the air, holding a sword and rushing toward the direction its tip indicated. However, he had barely flown far before stopping abruptly, his sword returning to normal. In the Rakshasa Hall, a crimson long sword hovered above its sword rack. This was none other than the Rakshasa Sword, one of the Seven凶Swords. Around this sword, countless other long swords surrounded it, their red blades emitting continuous hums. The surrounding swords trembled as if to protect the Rakshasa Sword. A battle spirit emerged from the Rakshasa Sword, as if encountering an unprecedented opponent. "Another ultimate凶剑 has appeared," muttered an old man seated beside the Rakshasa Sword, his face etched with admiration. This scene also unfolded elsewhere—within one of the Ten Yama Palaces, the Fengdu Palace. The Fengdu Palace also possessed a凶sword named Jueyun. "I wonder who possesses this凶sword and which one it is," a young man stood there, his face alight with amusement. Though youthful, his aura was terrifyingly immense; he extended a hand and the violently trembling sword rack instantly calmed. At this moment, Luo Tian and his companions were unaware that their emergence had caused such commotion. "I thought I saw a figure descending!" Big-Eyed Ghost suddenly recalled the moment they had rushed forward, when a shadow had fallen. That figure was Chen Dao. Chen Dao's speed was extraordinary; only Big-Eyed Ghost's eyes had glimpsed a trace of him, but he hadn't recognized his appearance. "Let it be whoever it is!" Luo Tian gazed at the terrifying magma, his eyes filled with admiration. The terrifying temperature made even him hesitate to linger in the magma for long. "Rushing...!" However, as Luo Tian's words fell, the terrifying magma surged again, transforming into a long dragon that rushed toward Luo Tian as if determined to not let him escape. "What the hell is going on?" Luo Tian's face shifted slightly, then he leapt into the air, his body darting upward. Huang Bai Shui, Big-Eyed Ghost, and Ye Chen scattered to flee. After a while, they realized no magma pursued them. "Stone! It must be your stone!" Huang Bai Shui shouted, his gaze turning to the red glowing stone in Luo Tian's hand. "This thing?" Luo Tian looked at the warm stone in his palm, reasoning that if it weren't for Longyuan Sword's connection, the only possibility was this stone. "This stone is definitely a treasure!" Luo Tian clutched the stone, not by choice but because he couldn't fit it into his storage bag. Even Longyuan Sword was the same. "Boom..." A figure burst forth from the magma, its body completely bald, hair burned away, looking quite pitiful. As soon as the figure appeared, it donned a robe and glared with fury, feeling its bare head. Chen Dao's eyes carried resentment; he had charged too recklessly and hadn't reacted in time, getting swept by the magma. He'd been washed clean by it. If not for his peak True Immortal cultivation, Chen Dao might have perished in the magma and barely escaped. However, Chen Dao's anger was futile; he could do nothing against the magma unless an Immortal King arrived to temporarily control the laws of heaven and earth, subduing it. "Uncle Dao, why are you here?" Luo Tian's face lit up with joy upon seeing Chen Dao. He had to recognize him after a while, as Chen Dao's appearance was unrecognizable compared to before. "Embarrassing..." Chen Dao felt a flush of shame, his face red. He quickly shouted: "You've mistaken me!" Chen Dao leapt into the air, becoming a streak of light that vanished from everyone's sight. Luo Tian watched Chen Dao leave, thinking he could help him. But Chen Dao's speed was too fast; even Luo Tian couldn't follow. "Damn it, I don't believe you can fly to the Wheel Turning Palace!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with madness. He grabbed Ye Chen, then shouted to Huang Bai Shui and the others: "You must listen to Uncle Huang. I'm leaving first!" After saying this, Luo Tian leapt into the air and exited Tiansha City, flying toward its southern direction. "Yes..." "Be careful..." Huang Bai Shui's eyes showed concern, gazing at Luo Tian leaving Tiansha City. Following him was a long magma dragon. As Luo Tian departed, Tiansha City gradually returned to calmness; most of the magma slowly flew back into the black hole, while some cooled down gradually. Luo Tian, however, was flying toward the Wheel Turning Palace with a magma dragon tail. He clutched a red stone in his hands, flying desperately. Luo Tian had attempted to throw the stone away several times but hesitated, as he was reluctant to part with it. On his journey, he tried stabbing the stone with the Rupture Spear but found it untouched, not even a mark. "It's definitely a treasure!" Luo Tian resolved to keep the stone. Meanwhile, the magma dragon behind him gradually weakened but still maintained its might, sweeping across areas with waves of heat. Chapter 2120: Wheel Turning Palace
In the dim sky, a streak of light flew swiftly. No one dared to block it because behind this streak was a red dragon with overwhelming might. "You're really harsh!" Luo Tian's heart trembled, his face pale. He had flown for nearly a month. This month had drained him greatly—not only did he have to fly desperately but also use his cultivation to suppress Longyuan Sword's demonic aura. Originally, it would take one and a half months to reach the Wheel Turning Palace, but Luo Tian had shortened it to a month. Excluding the time he walked to Tiansha City, it was exactly one month. For a whole month, Luo Tian hadn't rested at all. He passed through countless cities, causing people to gasp in astonishment each time he flashed by. Eventually, the story of the magma dragon and Luo Tian spread throughout the Beast Ghost King's territory. "Have you heard? A strongman is following a magma dragon, even True Immortal Late Periods avoid him!" "Of course I've heard. I also heard he's wandering through the Beast Ghost King's territory!" People in various cities discussed, feeling intrigued. Over this month, Luo Tian had repeatedly wanted to throw the stone away but ultimately held back as the magma dragon weakened. "Ahead should be the Beast King Mountains. Once I cross them, I can find the Wheel Turning Palace!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with madness. His True Immortal energy was nearly depleted. The Beast King Mountains were a region between the Beast Ghost King and Wheel Turning Palace, an area no one governed. Crossing it meant being close to the Wheel Turning Palace. The Beast King Mountains were like a forbidden zone, with vast forests and only a few daring souls venturing in to explore and seek treasures. "Boom..." Luo Tian gritted his teeth, ignoring whether it was a forbidden zone or not, and flew straight through. "My god, what is that? Who dares to fly over the Beast King Mountains!" Luo Tian's appearance immediately caught the attention of people searching for opportunities in the forest. At this moment, a group was carefully walking through the Beast King Mountains—none other than Lin Dong and the Wheel Turning Palace disciples who had arrived earlier. "Magma..." Lin Dong's face was filled with horror. Luo Tian's speed was too fast; even he hadn't seen his face. "How could there be such a thing?" People were puzzled, their faces showing confusion. Lin Dong felt the terrifying power of the magma dragon and had to be cautious. The entire Beast King Mountains suddenly became chaotic, awakening powerful ghost creatures that roared loudly. "Damn it, he's through, but he's awakened those ghosts! What do we do?" The Wheel Turning Palace disciples' faces turned grim, gazing at the red dragon disappearing into the distance, leaving dust scattered on their bodies. Lin Dong was also speechless; even he had to be careful in the Beast King Mountains. Unlike cities where people knew they were from the Wheel Turning Palace and would treat them kindly, this place was mostly ghosts. Who cared about their strength? They'd eat and gain cultivation. Who could find out? "Be careful, it should be fine..." Lin Dong sighed deeply, watching the red dragon disappear. Luo Tian was unaware of Lin Dong's presence and wouldn't have greeted them with the magma dragon if he had known. "Roar..." The roar echoed to the heavens as Luo Tian pushed forward, his fiery red dragon and the magma's terrifying temperature being a nightmare for these ghosts. Even True Immortal Peak ghosts were wary of it. Seeing Luo Tian had no intention to attack them, the ghosts didn't block his path and let him go. However, Lin Dong's group wasn't so lucky; the awakened ghosts first noticed them. Luo Tian didn't care about the dragon behind him and flew for three days, finally exiting the Beast King Mountains toward the Wheel Turning Palace. On his way, he again caused people's amazement. After flying three more days, Luo Tian finally saw a black hall towering into the clouds like a sharp sword piercing through dark clouds, radiating an imposing aura. Wheel Turning Palace! Though distant, Luo Tian felt the immense pressure from within the Wheel Turning Palace. He gritted his teeth and flew toward it. At the massive hall's entrance, two True Immortal Initial Stage youths stood there, their eyes filled with laziness. However, upon seeing Luo Tian and the magma dragon behind him, their faces instantly showed disbelief. "What is that?" They quickly noticed Luo Tian and the magma dragon. "Damn it, hurry to inform the elders! That dragon can crush us both!" One disciple spoke and rushed into the black hall. Within moments, hundreds of disciples with powerful auras emerged, along with over ten True Immortal Late Period elders. These elders were the Wheel Turning Palace's senior masters. "We can't stop them, hurry to find inner sect elders!" Ten elders' faces turned grim. They flew up and formed a barrier, covering the hall's entrance with ten people together pushing the barrier toward Luo Tian. "Who are you, daring to disrupt my Wheel Turning Palace? Seeking death?" The ten elders saw Luo Tian with the magma dragon and shouted, their hands glowing with radiant light. "Don't attack, elder I'm one of your own! I am also a disciple of the Wheel Turning Palace!" Luo Tian held the stone in one hand and showed the token given by Zhang Tiantian to his family, shouting. The ten True Immortal Late Period elders were no match for him, so he immediately revealed his identity. "Who are you?" As the ten elders were surprised, three shouts echoed, and three streaks of light burst from the Wheel Turning Palace. Their eyes were cold as they gazed at Luo Tian. As he approached, Luo Tian felt the terrifying power of the magma dragon behind him and his face slightly changed. The three who emerged were True Immortal Peak masters. Upon seeing Luo Tian's token, they waved their hands and formed another barrier, covering the three and the previous ten True Immortal Late Period elders. The ten together activated the barrier, rushing toward Luo Tian. "Come!" One elder shouted, his voice filled with authority. "Thank you for saving me, elders!" Luo Tian's eyes lit up, his face pale as he flew toward the barrier. Just before touching it, the barrier opened a gap, protecting Luo Tian. "Boom..." As Luo Tian entered the barrier, the terrifying magma dragon instantly arrived, crashing against the black barrier. The thunderous sound was overwhelming. Under the震撼 of the Wheel Turning Palace disciples, the magma dragon exploded violently, fire shooting into the sky and the heavens cracking. "Damn it!" The ten elders inside the barrier had a grim face, struggling against the terrifying temperature and impact. "Spit..." Luo Tian coughed up blood, finally taking a deep breath, his face pale as he stood behind the ten elders. He marveled at the Wheel Turning Palace's strength, which had instantly produced three True Immortal Peak masters and ten True Immortal Late Period elders. While the ten were fighting, Luo Tian's gaze turned to the stone in his hand, his eyebrows slightly raised. The stone remained the same, but Luo Tian clearly remembered he had spat blood on it. "It's a pity that this stone could be smaller!" Luo Tian thought to himself, realizing it was inconvenient to carry a stone all day. "Buzz..." As Luo Tian finished thinking, the red stone emitted waves of energy as if it understood his words. It slowly shrank to palm size. "Can it get any smaller?" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with light, thinking again. "Buzz..." The next moment, the red stone became as small as a fingernail, like a red gemstone in Luo Tian's palm. "Can it get any smaller?" Luo Tian narrowed his eyes, feeling the red stone's extraordinariness. He spoke again. "Buzz..." Waves of energy echoed, and the red gemstone shrank further, this time becoming as small as a dust particle. With Luo Tian's eyesight, it was almost invisible. "This is truly a treasure!" Luo Tian's eyes glowed with light, thinking about throwing it at someone to achieve unexpected results. "Hey, don't think of such nonsense! My grandfather wouldn't obey you!" Just as Luo Tian was fantasizing, a dismissive voice echoed in his ears. "Who..." "Who is speaking?" Luo Tian was startled, looking around with a cautious gaze. "It's me! I was sleeping and didn't expect to be disturbed by you!" "Not only did you disturb me, but you also made me your master! You took advantage of my situation!" An angry voice echoed, making Luo Tian stunned. "Is it... you speaking?" Luo Tian looked at the barely visible dust particle in his palm, his eyes filled with disbelief. "The stone... can talk!" If it weren't for the restriction of not shouting, Luo Tian would have shouted. This was his first time encountering such a thing. "You've made me your master?" Luo Tian suddenly realized the stone's words, his eyes glowing with light. "Come on, tell me what abilities you have!" Luo Tian became boastful, communicating with the stone through his mind. "Boom..." As soon as Luo Tian finished speaking, a black vortex rose from the sky, sucking in the shattered magma fragments. "Who are you? Whose disciple is it, daring to bring trouble to the Wheel Turning Palace!" As Luo Tian asked the question, a solemn voice echoed in his ears, bringing him back to reality. Chapter 2121: The Rules of the Wheel Turning Palace
"I am Luo Chen, the嫡son of the Luo family from Beast Ghost King City!" Luo Tian quickly ignored the stone's words and addressed the three True Immortal Peak masters. "Beast Ghost King City? The Luo family?" The three elders' brows slightly furrowed. Then a disciple spoke: "It's the one specially recruited, Luo Chen from the Luo family!" "Oh, so it was through backdoors!" One elder's face showed understanding. The three inner sect elders of the Wheel Turning Palace naturally knew about backdoors. Disciples' faces instantly showed disdain; Luo Tian had just arrived and brought a magma dragon, entering through backdoors. This made them somewhat annoyed. "Where is the red stone you held?" One elder asked, gazing at Luo Tian. They naturally noticed the red stone he had earlier, though it was gone now. However, they could sense it wasn't an ordinary item. "The stone mysteriously disappeared, I don't know why!" Luo Tian quickly replied, convinced the three wouldn't find a dust-like stone. "It seems you don't understand the Wheel Turning Palace's rules. In the Wheel Turning Palace, if you have strength, everything can be taken!" One elder chuckled lightly. "Can everything be taken?" Luo Tian's body slightly trembled, surprised the Wheel Turning Palace was so harsh. If you had strength, everything could be taken—this rule was too bad for Luo Tian. As a new arrival with weak foundations, he wasn't afraid of peers but feared the elders, like these three True Immortal Peak masters. If they really took from him, he had nowhere to complain. However, Luo Tian now had a secret weapon: Longyuan Sword. He was certain that unlocking Longyuan Sword's seal would allow him to fight a True Immortal Peak master. But there were limitations; the demonic aura in Longyuan Sword was too strong, and he could only use it for a short time. He hadn't tested it yet. But even one moment of using it would be enough for him to unleash the "One Sword Against Immortals" technique. What kind of power would that be? Luo Tian thought it was terrifying. "Three elders, are you trying to take from me?" Luo Tian's face hardened, sensing the intense hostility in everyone's eyes, as if they saw him as a soft target. "Why did Lin Dong and the others return together?" The elder asked, voice filled with confusion. Normally, those who entered through backdoors would return with the examiners. "I don't know. I came on my own; they left a few days earlier. Maybe something happened on the way!" Luo Tian shook his head lightly; he had flown all the way, not caring about Lin Dong's whereabouts. "Little fellow, hand over that stone or we'll take your pants!" Disciples' faces instantly shouted, their voices filled with disdain. "That big sword behind you is also nice; let's take it too!" Immediately, someone joined the shouting, their eyes filled with excitement. These disciples understood the three elders' intention—obviously to delay time, giving them a chance to react and take the stone for themselves. Three True Immortal Peak masters were inner sect elders; it was somewhat embarrassing to fight a True Immortal Mid Period disciple. The Wheel Turning Palace rarely had elders take things from disciples, so their words were obviously a hint to the disciples. "Face?" Luo Tian silently laughed, looking at the hundreds of True Immortal Initial and Mid Period disciples. He understood the three's intention. "It seems I need to intimidate them!" Luo Tian lightly removed the big sword from his back but didn't draw it. "Haha, still resisting!" Seeing Luo Tian's action, the Wheel Turning Palace disciples immediately mocked. These disciples who entered through backdoors were only those with connections from the Eight Great Heavenly Kings; others weren't worth their attention. The Luo family of Beast Ghost King City, they hadn't even heard of it. "Can you kill?" Luo Tian lightly tapped Longyuan Sword, asking softly. As long as it wasn't a True Immortal Peak master's attack, Luo Tian had some confidence. "Still want to kill? If you can kill, go ahead. But if you die, it's your own fault!" The three True Immortal Peak elders' faces showed a slight smile. In hell, human lives were the cheapest. That was why Zhang Tiantian had wanted to ruin Luo Tian—afraid he would seek revenge at the Wheel Turning Palace and risk his life. "What a great place!" Luo Tian thought to himself, gazing at the disciples surrounding him. "Fine, to save some trouble, let's see Longyuan Sword's power and kill a few people!" Luo Tian thought to himself, gazing at the hundreds of disciples. "Who wants to take from me? Step forward so I don't accidentally hurt the innocent!" Luo Tian shouted loudly, his voice cold. His aura gradually rose. "I want to take from you! What's wrong with that? Dare to resist?" As Luo Tian's words fell, a young man stepped forward, his face filled with disdain. "I also want to take from you! If you dare kill me, who do you think you are?" "I also..." voices echoed as disciples stepped forward. A moment later, shouts filled the air; only a few didn't step forward, about two or three hundred disciples. "Buzz..." A wave spread; a ghostly figure instantly appeared in front of the first speaking disciple. Crimson light flashed, breaking through space and striking the young man's body. "Boom..." Blood mist rose; the young man hadn't reacted in time and was smashed into a pile of meat, lying on the ground. "Boom..." Seeing the pile of meat, people instantly became chaotic, gazing at Luo Tian with disbelief. Even the ten True Immortal Late Period elders and three True Immortal Peak inner sect elders had expressions of surprise. "Steady, accurate, and ruthless!" One True Immortal Peak elder spoke, his voice filled with admiration. "Still want to kill? All of you attack and kill him!" Seeing the pile of meat, people shouted loudly. But Luo Tian didn't give them time to react; if they combined their martial arts, he would have some trouble. He immediately seized the initiative and continuously struck with his big sword. Each strike caused a Wheel Turning Palace disciple to scream. "So strong!" Disciples who hadn't spoken before showed shock, watching Luo Tian like a tiger in a sheep pen. "True Immortal Initial, one strike per person; True Immortal Mid Period, two strikes per person. When did the Wheel Turning Palace disciples become so easy to kill? Is he a disciple from an ordinary family? When the Eight Great Heavenly Kings came to the Wheel Turning Palace, they didn't have this strength!" People whispered among themselves. At that moment, Luo Tian was no longer looked down upon but instead showed respect for the strong. "His body is too powerful!" The ten True Immortal Late Period elders had sharp eyes, immediately noticing Luo Tian's strength. "Boom boom boom..." Luo Tian was also delighted; his body was originally strong, and although his cultivation was suppressed by four-tenths, Longyuan Sword compensated for this. This big sword wasn't heavy in his hand but was沉重 when striking people, combined with Luo Tian's cultivation and body strength. This was why he could kill True Immortal Initial disciples. "What a great sword!" Luo Tian thought, within a quarter of an hour, the ground was bloodied with dozens of disciples lying in pools. Their attacks hit Luo Tian's body, causing injuries, but he didn't care. He swung the big sword repeatedly. "Next, let's try sword energy!" Luo Tian's eyes glowed with light; these people became his targets to test Longyuan Sword. Luo Tian poured his cultivation into Longyuan Sword, and a terrifying aura erupted from it. At this moment, dozens of disciples hiding behind the crowd who hadn't been affected by Luo Tian also activated their martial arts, dozens of techniques descending from the sky. A massive torrent surged toward Luo Tian. Luo Tian's eyes slightly changed, holding Longyuan Sword in front of him. The wide blade instantly blocked half his body. Boom boom boom... Each technique hit Longyuan Sword, and with each impact, Luo Tian's body retreated a step. Deep grooves appeared in front of him. "What a great sword!" The ten elders watched the techniques blocked by Longyuan Sword, their faces showing admiration. "He never drew his sword from the beginning; that's what's terrifying!" One True Immortal Peak elder's face showed a glimmer of light. Luo Tian retreated a hundred feet, coughing up blood. After all, it was the combined martial arts of many people; even he found it challenging to withstand. Luo Tian's arms trembled as he gazed at the Wheel Turning Palace disciples, a smile on his face: "Now it's my turn!" "Continue to attack; don't let him get close, or we'll all be done!" Disciples' faces turned grim. This time, two hundred and more techniques were gathered, their power overwhelming, causing the sky to change color as they rapidly converged. The sword hung in the air; Luo Tian held both hands on the sword, and a terrifying aura erupted from Longyuan Sword in his hand. His True Immortal energy was completely drained, and a surge of sword intent spread out, making the ten True Immortal Late Period elders' faces change abruptly because they felt a strong threat in one strike. "Buzz..." A gray vortex appeared in the sky, the heavens collapsing as techniques rushed toward Luo Tian. "One sword!" Luo Tian's face was pale, feeling the sword intent of Longyuan Sword had reached its peak. He spoke softly. Chapter 2122: Overbearing the Weak
"Immortal Sword!" Luo Tian's cold voice echoed, and a sword intent imbued with infinite power erupted from Longyuan Sword. The sword intent pierced the sky, disturbing the heavens; Luo Tian's hands slashed forward, and a towering sword intent struck toward the techniques hurled by the Wheel Turning Palace disciples. "Is this really a technique from True Immortal Mid Period?" The ten True Immortal Late Period elders' eyes were shocked, feeling a strong threat under this sword intent. "Boom boom boom..." Thunder rolled; the collision sound exploded in the sky, and the techniques were annihilated by this overwhelming sword intent. The heavens continuously collapsed, chaotic currents of void swept out, and the Wheel Turning Palace disciples were shaken. "Who is attacking our Wheel Turning Palace?" Disciples' faces showed shock, standing in the Wheel Turning Palace and watching the collapsed heavens. They flew toward the palace's entrance. Waves of energy surged; the massive sword intent was annihilated by techniques, leaving the Wheel Turning Palace disciples stunned. These were two hundred plus people's combined techniques; even True Immortal Late Period masters would be repelled. Yet this Luo family disciple had blocked them. "Buzz..." Luo Tian's face was pale, holding the big sword and flying upward, breaking through the waves of energy. He instantly appeared before the disciples, striking another wave of blood mist. Luo Tian didn't want to be hit again; if it happened once more, he wouldn't have the extra True Immortal energy. Also, four-tenths of his cultivation were suppressed by Longyuan Sword. "I give up!" Disciples instantly became terrified, as they had completely feared Luo Tian. "It's too late!" Luo Tian smiled, blood still on his face, making him look terrifying. "Ahh..." A piercing scream echoed in their ears as disciples were killed by Luo Tian's blows at the Wheel Turning Palace entrance. "My god, who is this? Why is he so fierce!" New disciples and elders' faces showed shock, gazing at the ruthless Luo Tian. They were shocked by his brutality. "Enough..." Finally, a True Immortal Late Period elder couldn't bear it anymore. Seeing Luo Tian crush the Wheel Turning Palace disciples like swatting flies, his face was grim. He flew up and unleashed a True Immortal Late Period aura, standing before Luo Tian. "Buzz..." A long sword swept across, slashing toward Luo Tian. Luo Tian's eyes slightly narrowed; he no longer struck people but held Longyuan Sword across, colliding with the long sword. "Crack..." The collision sound echoed again; Luo Tian's body flew back, spitting out blood. The elder also retreated two steps, causing the disciples to gasp in astonishment. "Master Lu was repelled! He's a True Immortal Late Period master! Who is this person!" New disciples and elders' faces showed shock. "I also wanted to take you, come cut me!" The elder's face was angry, shouting at Luo Tian. He had observed Luo Tian for a while and noticed he killed with his body, guessing Luo Tian's True Immortal energy was exhausted. After all, that sword technique had made even them feel a strong threat; such an attack couldn't help but drain Luo Tian. Therefore, the elder judged that Luo Tian was already at his limit—just relying on his body. Though it was a bit embarrassing, the elder was envious of Longyuan Sword in Luo Tian's hands. With the elder blocking, other Wheel Turning Palace disciples sighed deeply, their faces filled with fear, gazing at Luo Tian as if he stood in a sea of blood. "This person is not to be provoked; from the beginning, he has no survivors. He's extremely ruthless!" Disciples of the Wheel Turning Palace thought about Luo Tian, forming an impression. Many people had established their authority upon entering the Wheel Turning Palace, but few achieved this level—killing directly without caring that it was the Wheel Turning Palace. "True Immortal Late Period? I've killed one!" Luo Tian coldly spoke, gazing at the elder and wiping blood from his mouth. "I believe it!" Master Lu nodded; if Luo Tian had killed a True Immortal Late Period at his peak, he would believe it. "But you can't kill me now!" Master Lu spoke again, his eyes filled with confidence. "You can try!" Luo Tian's face showed a slight smile, lightly tapping Longyuan Sword in his hand. The sword sheath emitted a continuous buzz. "He hasn't drawn his sword yet!" Seeing Luo Tian lightly tapping Longyuan Sword, people's faces instantly showed shock. They suddenly realized that up to now, they hadn't seen Luo Tian truly draw his sword. "Draw your sword; I really want to see what this sword looks like and its true power!" Master Lu's face showed a slight smile. The three True Immortal Peak inner sect elders' faces also showed expectation, gazing at Luo Tian. "You're not worthy!" Luo Tian lightly shook his head; this sentence made Master Lu's face dark. "Then I'll kill you!" Master Lu roared, his black sword surged with energy, slashing toward Luo Tian. "Killing a True Immortal Late Period—do you think it's enough to intimidate?" Luo Tian muttered, his aura gradually rising. At this moment, he no longer suppressed Longyuan Sword. "Boom..." Without suppression, a terrifying demonic aura erupted from Longyuan Sword. A cold atmosphere swept over them, instantly making people shiver. "Buzz..." Demonic aura dragons continuously surged; Longyuan Sword emitted a continuous buzz, as if trying to break free from the sheath. Luo Tian held both hands on the sword; his eyes flashed with red light, and he let out a roar. His killing intent continuously rose. A thought suddenly arose in Luo Tian's mind: to draw Longyuan Sword and kill everyone here. "One Sword Against Immortals!" Luo Tian knew he couldn't delay any longer; his time was limited. The more he delayed, the more dangerous it became. A terrifying sword intent rose again; this time even more overwhelming. The sword intent contained a massive demonic aura, increasing its power. The heavens changed color; winds and clouds reversed. An immense power swept over the area as Luo Tian slashed with his sword, time seemingly freezing. People's eyes only saw this overwhelming sword intent. "Break..." The sword intent instantly severed the elder's blade, shattering it into chaos and sweeping toward all directions. The elder's face was grim; seeing his blade destroyed by this big sword and flying back toward him, he regretted it. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to still have strength. This strike made the three True Immortal Peak elders' faces turn grim, their eyes filled with seriousness. "Spit..." Blood splattered; the big sword struck the elder's body, creating a deep wound. The elder's body flew back, almost being split in two by the sword. Luo Tian grabbed a pill and quickly recovered his cultivation. He leaned on Longyuan Sword, and the dragon-shaped sword returned to its sheath.
