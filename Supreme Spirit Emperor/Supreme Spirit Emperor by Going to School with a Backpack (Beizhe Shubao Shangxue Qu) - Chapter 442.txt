Futu and his two companions had grim expressions; they hadn't anticipated such an outcome. Gazing at the formidable martial arts techniques that shook heaven and earth, their eyes reflected terror. With so many people attacking three individuals, only an Epoch Lord could withstand it. They knew that Luo Tian's group alone had nearly twenty near-Epoch Lords.

"Boom... boom... boom..." The deafening roar echoed within the seven-colored flame barrier. Futu and his companions didn't even manage a single breath before being obliterated into nothingness by the combined force of all.

"Boom!" The immense power shattered the seven-colored flame barrier instantly, scattering outward and annihilating countless divine souls. Within a hundred feet around the group, a vacuum formed.

"So simple?" Luo Tian's face bore admiration as he gazed at Du Hongxi and others. This was a formidable faction; if they could be united to serve the Nine Realms, combined with humanity, as long as no ancient royal kings appeared, they would be no match for humanity.

"Regrettable," Wu Wang's face showed disappointment. "I was hoping to warm up, but it ended so quickly!"

"Let's go!" Luo Tian observed the remaining residual souls charging toward them. He extended a hand, and the seven-colored flames surged again. At that moment, they were less than a thousand feet away from the Immortal Tide. Luo Tian could use flames to isolate those residual souls, and a thousand-foot-long flame passage appeared before everyone's eyes.

Luo Tian leapt forward toward the Immortal Tide, and others followed closely behind him. This time, there was no surprise; within a dozen breaths, they plunged into the Immortal Tide and exhaled long sighs of relief.

"Buzz..." The seven-colored flames returned to Luo Tian's front, and the powerful residual souls once again filled the world. They howled, surrounding the Immortal Tide.

"Luotian!" Seeing Luo Tian and his companions unharmed, Zheng Xin and Jiang Nanxuan exhaled in relief. Yet their expressions remained tense.

"You dared to deceive us!" Upon entering the Immortal Tide, Du Hongxi, Guan Yuxin, and Ma Xiuzhen's faces turned furious. They separated from Luo Tian's group instinctively, eyes filled with murderous intent as they stared at Diaodezhu.

"I, Du Hongxi, have never suffered such a loss in the Immortal Realm. I never expected to be defeated by an outstanding talent of the Three Thousand Worlds!" Du Hongxi's body radiated green energy, his gaze fixed on Diaodezhu as if preparing to attack.

"Uh..." Diaodezhu's body trembled slightly. He hadn't expected them to be so vengeful. Seeing their eyes that could kill, he instinctively shrank back and peeked at Luo Tian.

As the participants of the trials unleashed their power, the situation within the Immortal Tide grew tense again. Long Jie and Yao Chen stood behind Luo Tian, eyes cautious as they watched Du Hongxi's group.

Wu Wang and Jun Wulei merely crossed their arms, watching the spectacle with a detached air. They intended to stay neutral and let events unfold while their bodies absorbed the Immortal Qi.

"What do you mean?" Luo Tian's brows furrowed slightly. At this moment, they had no fear of Du Hongxi's group. Though their numbers were greater, each carried injuries and was exhausted from continuous battles.

In contrast, Luo Tian's group had barely fought. Even when they did, it was a crushing victory with no real exhaustion. Moreover, after so long, they had been refining the Immortal Qi, significantly boosting their strength. If a battle ensued, the outcome was uncertain.

"Nothing special. You saved us earlier; we're grateful. But he can't be forgiven for deceiving us. This isn't over!" Ma Xiuzhen roared, pointing at Diaodezhu behind Luo Tian.

"What do you want? We're not afraid of a fight!" Yao Chen shouted, his staff planted firmly on the ground. His body radiated battle spirit, and others also exuded overwhelming power.

"We deceived you; that was our mistake. But consider this: if we hadn't deceived you, would we still be alive? Perhaps we'd have been killed the moment you recognized us!" Luo Tian spoke loudly, standing at the front of his group. His gaze met Du Hongxi's directly.

"Moreover, the issue isn't us but those residual souls outside. Do you think the hidden person's methods end here?" Luo Tian sighed deeply, pointing at the countless residual souls outside. His gaze met Du Hongxi's.

"This isn't over. Once we deal with the residual souls, we'll settle accounts with him!" Du Hongxi's group furrowed their brows slightly. They could sense these sudden residual souls were no ordinary threat.

"Fine, I'll see it through. But first, we must deal with those things outside!" Luo Tian spoke softly, exhaling a breath of relief. He truly feared they'd be foolish enough to fight within the Immortal Tide.

"What's there to deal with? Simply refine the Immortal Qi in this tide and destroy those residual souls!" Guan Yuxin sneered, then gazed at the surging Immortal Qi beyond the altar. He sat cross-legged and began refining it.

"Yes!" Hearing Guan Yuxin's words, the participants of the trials displayed greedy expressions. They had sacrificed much for this Immortal Qi.

In an instant, they all sat cross-legged and began refining the powerful Immortal Qi. In their eyes, as long as they refined this Qi, their strength would rise again. Then, using the Immortal Qi to power martial arts, those residual souls were insignificant.

"Ah... I hope it's that simple," Luo Tian sighed deeply. At this moment, the trial participants weren't fighting them, but they were no longer under Luo Tian's control.

"Let's refine it too!" Seeing the trial participants' actions, Zheng Xin and others showed anxious expressions. Though there was much Immortal Qi, it wasn't enough for so many people.

"Okay," Luo Tian nodded and sat cross-legged with everyone else, beginning to refine the Qi.

"But just as we sat down," a cold voice echoed from outside the Immortal Tide, causing Luo Tian's group to sink in heart.

"Roar..." A roar echoed out. Dozens of residual souls surged into action outside the Immortal Tide, sending waves of fervent intent.

"Can't stay seated?" As soon as they sat down, Luo Tian's group stood up again. Their gazes were tense as they looked outside the Immortal Tide.

Roaring, a figure in golden robes stepped forward amidst countless residual souls. His golden eyes radiated divine light, and he gazed at Luo Tian's group within the Immortal Tide with a contemplative expression.

"Sun Miechen!" The next moment, Sun Feiwen gasped, his eyes locked onto the figure now at the edge of the Immortal Tide.

The former Divine Prince of the Divine Clan, the Eternal Body, Sun Miechen. After so many years of disappearance, he had finally reappeared before them.

"Ah, it's been a while," Sun Miechen spoke softly, his gaze deep as he looked at Luo Tian standing in front of the group.

Though Luo Tian had prepared for this, seeing Sun Miechen still caused a slight shock. His eyes flashed with violet light as he gazed at Sun Miechen, then his eyes narrowed. Luo Tian saw that the body of Sun Miechen was possessed by another's soul, and this person was one he recognized—Qiu Jingming, the Seventh Generation Guardian.

"Qiu Jingming! You're still alive!" Luo Tian gazed at Sun Miechen, his expression turning incredulous. He clearly remembered Qiu Jingming being destroyed in the Underworld. How could he have survived such a situation, causing so much turmoil?

"Of course I'm alive. That old bastard Duan Tian never killed me. How could a little kid like you kill me?" Qiu Jingming's face showed disdain as he spoke to Luo Tian.

"Qiu Jingming!" Hearing Luo Tian's words, Wu Wang's face turned shocked. He gazed at Sun Miechen with disbelief. Others might not know Qiu Jingming's name, but Wu Wang certainly did.

The Seventh Generation Guardian. His strength was just a step away from attaining the Dao. If it weren't for his father Duan Tian achieving the Dao first, who knows what would have happened.

"You!" Seeing Wu Wang, Qiu Jingming's face darkened. He recognized the man before him—his hatred was unmistakable.

"Haha, I never expected to meet the son of that old bastard Duan Tian here. It's as if heaven is helping me!" Qiu Jingming laughed loudly, his face filled with madness.

"Back then, that old bastard Duan Tian almost killed me. Today I'll kill his son. He never expected his son would die at my hands!" Qiu Jingming roared, his voice filled with insanity. If there was anyone Qiu Jingming hated more than Luo Tian, it was Duan Tian.

"Who are you calling a bastard!" Wu Wang's gaze locked onto Qiu Jingming, his eyes filled with killing intent. Though Qiu Jingming had been renowned in the era when Duan Tian achieved the Dao, Wu Wang felt Qiu Jingming was no longer as formidable.

"Kid, you're bold. You really take after your father's nature. But you're still not your father!" Qiu Jingming's face was cold.

"Good, we're all here. Let's settle this today!" Qiu Jingming's gaze swept over Luo Tian's group before speaking softly.

Chapter 1724: You Have No Chance ()

"Take them all at once. Just you?" Wu Wang's face showed disdain as he spoke again.

"Come in, let me see how you plan to take them all at once. Back then my father subdued you once, and today I'll do it again!" Wu Wang shouted, his voice filled with arrogance.

"Come in?" Qiu Jingming sneered, standing outside the Immortal Tide. His gaze swept over Luo Tian's group.

"Did I think you could subdue me? Even that old bastard Duan Tian never managed to kill me. I never expected his son would dare claim he could subdue me!" Qiu Jingming spoke softly, then moved his hands.

"Think you can't touch them just because they're inside the Immortal Tide?" Qiu Jingming sneered, invisible waves radiating from his hands. He then pressed both palms to the ground.

"Crack..." Gray runes flowed out, covering the red earth. A terrifying aura spread from the runes, causing Luo Tian's group to feel fear.

"Go out. All of you attack together and kill him!" Luo Tian's eyes were serious; he didn't want to delay. If they all attacked together, perhaps they could directly obliterate Qiu Jingming as they had done with Nan Gong Wu Bei and Futu.

"Good!" Everyone nodded, including Du Hongxi's group. They felt Qiu Jingming was no easy opponent and stood up.

However, just as they stood up, a gray figure emerged from the gray runes. It stretched out and transformed into a gray phoenix.

"Familiar feeling!" Luo Tian gazed at the gray phoenix, sensing something familiar.

"Recognize it? This is your old friend!" Qiu Jingming smiled, moving his hands to continuously imprint gray runes onto the ground.

"Fei Jiutian!" Long Jie and Diaodezhu looked at the phoenix enveloped in gray energy, their faces filled with disbelief.

"Fei Jiutian!" Hearing Long Jie and Diaodezhu's words, Luo Tian's group inhaled sharply. Their eyes also showed shock—Fei Jiutian was still alive?

"No, the state's wrong. He has no consciousness!" Soon after, Luo Tian noticed the gray eyes—beyond coldness, there was no other emotion.

"Boom... boom... boom..." As Luo Tian was shocked, the red earth continuously cracked. Dozens of gray figures emerged from the ground, radiating powerful auras.

"Those are Yu Fan Tian... Hun Ba Tian... Ming Huan..." Dozens of familiar figures appeared in Luo Tian's group's vision. In an instant, ninety-nine figures emerged.

"These people are all the talents we've killed over the years! And the children of ancient royal clans!" Their eyes showed shock, gazing at the ninety-nine figures standing beside Qiu Jingming.

"This method is beyond heaven!" Luo Tian's eyes also showed shock. To revive the dead, such a method could震撼 everyone.

"Recognized it?" Qiu Jingming smiled, gazing at his masterpiece with satisfaction.

"Do you think I've lived this long for nothing? These people are dead, but they still have some resentment left. I found them and their blood was hard to find—I've searched for so long, but only managed a little. Using my method, I revived them!" Qiu Jingming spoke softly.

"Amazing!" Everyone gazed at Qiu Jingming, admiration in their eyes. Even as an enemy, they couldn't help but admire Qiu Jingming's audacity.

"Indeed, one who dared to challenge Duan Tian. Even Duan Tian couldn't subdue him!" They sighed.

"Enough, let them have a good reunion later! I'll refine this Immortal Tide first!" Qiu Jingming gazed at Luo Tian's group within the Immortal Tide, his eyes flashing with light.

"Waited so long. This life, I finally will attain the Dao. Duan Tian old bastard, hope you're waiting for me in the Immortal Realm. Today I'll kill your son first. When I reach the Immortal Realm, I'll personally kill you!" Qiu Jingming spoke coldly, his hands moving again.

"Refine it!" Qiu Jingming's eyes flashed with light. He moved his hands, and a drop of blood flew from his fingertip.

Golden divine blood, like a blazing sun, immediately caused the residual souls to go mad. A powerful aura radiated from the divine blood, which was completely devoured by the residual souls.

"Thanks to this Eternal Body, I couldn't have revived these people without it!"

"Go!" Qiu Jingming spoke softly, his voice filled with authority. As if he were the master of this world.

"Roar..." Qiu Jingming's words echoed, and the residual souls absorbed the divine blood's waves. They became frenzied, rushing toward the Immortal Tide in waves. A massive suction force radiated from the souls, affecting the Immortal Tide.

"Buzz..." The powerful suction combined with the residual souls' suicidal attacks caused the entire Immortal Tide to tremble violently, making the towering column of light appear as if it could collapse at any moment.

"Attack! If you die, choose to retreat!" Luo Tian shouted at everyone before moving. He knew they couldn't wait any longer.

Seeing Luo Tian attack, Long Jie and Yao Chen also followed behind him, rushing toward Qiu Jingming.

"Go! You died at the hands of these people before. Now I give you a chance to take revenge!" Qiu Jingming's face was cold as he spoke to the gray-enshrouded figure before him. His words echoed, and a group of figures rushed forward.

Fei Ming sound rang out; the gray phoenix, like a ghostly phoenix, flapped its wings and spat out a vast expanse of gray fire toward Luo Tian.

"I can kill you once, twice, and even thrice!" Luo Tian's aura surged as he ran. His hands moved, and the Law of the World manifested instantly. His body exploded in size, becoming a hundred-foot-tall giant. He punched.

"Boom..." The overwhelming fire was shattered by Luo Tian's punch, and Man Qi Tuo immediately stepped forward. He stomped on Fei Jiutian's massive body.

"Buzz..." Gray feather waves rose, and without waiting for Luo Tian to attack again, a series of gray feather waves swept the world. They formed a swirling vortex and rushed toward Luo Tian. The one who attacked was Yu Fan Tian, the former prince of the Fei Clan.

"Everyone has grown stronger!" Luo Tian's heart tightened. His body radiated golden light, enduring the gray feather waves on his invincible flesh.

"Back then, when I killed Fei Jiutian, he was in the late Epoch. I never expected him to become a near-Epoch Lord!" Luo Tian muttered, gazing at Qiu Jingming with cold eyes. His admiration for Qiu Jingming's methods deepened.

A gray feather wave exploded before Luo Tian, leaving bloodstains on his body. They healed instantly.

"Kill..." At the same time, Yao Chen and Long Jie faced others. The deafening sound of combat echoed but was quickly suppressed. They totaled nearly ten people, even with Du Hongxi and Guan Yuxin's help, they were no more than seventy or eighty. Many hadn't reached the near-Epoch Lord level.

In contrast, Qiu Jingming's revived people were all radiating terrifying auras. Each was a near-Epoch Lord, and the countless residual souls also greatly affected their strength, suppressing them.

"Ah..." In an instant of collision, two遗民 were torn apart by two people. Others who hadn't reached the near-Epoch Lord level struggled to hold on. The only relief was that these revived people had no consciousness.

Luo Tian's group could still fight two against one, reducing others' pressure significantly.

Luo Tian moved his hands, casting numerous great techniques to clash with Fei Jiutian and Yu Fan Tian. He subdued them, but his heart was anxious because Qiu Jingming hadn't moved. He stood there coldly, watching them fight.

"Buzz..." A residual soul flew to Qiu Jingming's front. Within it was a piece of Immortal Qi, causing Qiu Jingming to show satisfaction.

"Have fun!" Qiu Jingming smiled softly and waved his hand. Four supreme waves rose, hovering above his head—these were Sun Zhangyang, Nan Gong Wu Bei, and Futu, who had been killed by Luo Tian's group before.

"Did it succeed?" Seeing Luo Tian's group fighting, Sun Zhangyang and others showed great joy. They stood before Qiu Jingming.

"Yes, it succeeded!" Qiu Jingming nodded, gazing at the four.

"Quickly extract the Immortal Qi from the Immortal Tide and refine it. That way, our strength will definitely rise another level!" Nan Gong Wu Bei shouted excitedly.

"Haha, Luo Tian, after we refine this Immortal Qi, I'll personally kill you!" Sun Zhangyang's face was grotesque as he shouted.

"But you have no chance now!" Before Sun Zhangyang finished speaking, a cold voice echoed behind him.

"Annihilate the soul!" The cold voice carried no emotional waves, causing Sun Zhangyang's group to change faces. Their bodies trembled violently as they turned around, gazing at Qiu Jingming standing behind them.

"Thank you for helping me delay so long. I no longer need you. This Immortal Qi is better left to me alone!" Qiu Jingming's eyes were deep, and four gray soul threads flew from his hands into Sun Zhangyang's bodies.

Chapter 1725: Do You Recognize This Person? ()

The gray soul threads entered Sun Zhangyang's bodies, causing them to tremble more violently. Their eyes showed terror as they felt their souls being eroded at a terrifying speed.

Sun Zhangyang's group had already been obliterated by Luo Tian's group once. If they died again now, they would be truly dead.

"Qiu Jingming, what are you doing!" They hadn't expected this change. Qiu Jingming, once an ally, now attacked them.

"Of course I'm sending you to your deaths. You're quite strong but are as foolish as a fool, being defeated by that kid again and again. It's no wonder!" Qiu Jingming's face was cold as he gazed at Sun Zhangyang.

"You bastard!" Sun Zhangyang's face turned pale. He looked at Qiu Jingming, trying to summon the Epoch Relics hovering above their heads.

"Useless. I never predicted you four would have these relics!" Qiu Jingming shook his head, speaking again: "Two years ago, I secretly placed soul seals on you. I also tampered with the Epoch Relics. Once I refine your souls and integrate them into my body, I'll be able to control these relics!" Qiu Jingming's face showed disdain as he spoke to them.

"You'll never have a good death!" Sun Zhangyang roared, but found his body unresponsive. He could only watch as his soul was continuously extracted.

"Never have a good death? Who has the right to make me suffer?" Qiu Jingming grabbed a residual soul carrying Immortal Qi, smashing it. The Immortal Qi was absorbed into his body, and he wore an expression of pleasure.

"Beautiful feeling. Powerful! Next step is to obtain the inner disciple's quota for Star River Palace, attain the Dao, and enter Star River Palace in the Immortal Realm. Then find Duan Tian and kill him!" Qiu Jingming's face showed satisfaction, refining the Immortal Qi while also consuming Sun Zhangyang's souls.

"Buzz..." A series of buzzes rose from Sun Zhangyang, Nan Gong Wu Bei's group. Within an hour, their bodies rapidly turned gray and lost vitality. However, their gray eyes still held resentment.

"Boom!" Qiu Jingming waved his hand, and the four bodies exploded into gray smoke, dispersing in the world. Thus, the four powerful Epoch Lords' children were completely annihilated. The four supreme relics hovering above Qiu Jingming's head emitted mournful sounds.

"Dead..." Luo Tian's aura surged as he subdued Fei Jiutian and Yu Fan Tian while observing Qiu Jingming's situation. Seeing Sun Zhangyang's group dead, his heart sighed.

They had been outstanding talents but ended up like this—killed by their own allies. How tragic.

"Wrong to trust the wrong person!" Luo Tian sighed in his heart, but a shadow fell over him. Qiu Jingming's front had more residual souls gathering and being refined.

"Can't let him refine the Immortal Tide!" Luo Tian's heart tightened. If Qiu Jingming refined the Immortal Tide, he might indeed attain the Dao. Even if not, so much Immortal Qi would be devastating for them.

"Man's Wrath Stomps the Nine Heavens!" Thinking this, Luo Tian unleashed his power. His golden foot stepped forward, initiating Man Qi Tuo and stomping toward Fei Jiutian and Yu Fan Tian.

"Roar..." The two gray figures roared, seemingly unaware. They attacked suicidally, allowing Luo Tian's strength to be countered while striking back with powerful attacks.

"Boom!" The golden foot stomped on Fei Jiutian's massive body, directly crushing it to the ground. At the same time, Yu Fan Tian's attack was launched—gray feather waves converged into a supreme blade and slashed toward Luo Tian.

"Go away..." Luo Tian's massive body turned around, punching to meet the gray feather waves.

Bloodlight flashed. At the same time, the gray feather waves were shattered by Luo Tian's strike, turning into a series of gray feathers floating before him.

"Roar..." A low roar echoed. Fei Jiutian's massive body under Luo Tian's foot trembled, as if trying to escape Luo Tian's golden foot.

"Man's Wrath Crushes the Stars!" But Luo Tian didn't give Fei Jiutian a chance to recover. As his hands moved, the golden foot fell again.

"Sealing Heaven's Seal!" At the same time as his second step, a golden seal appeared above Luo Tian's head. It radiated overwhelming power and smashed toward Yu Fan Tian.

"That's my father's martial art!" Jun Wulei, who was fighting against Ming Huan and Ming Zhenyan, showed surprise. He gazed at the sealing heaven's seal above Luo Tian.

"Did he obtain my father's inheritance?" Jun Wulei's eyes glowed with light, gazing at Luo Tian who had taken his third step.

"Crack..." A crackling sound echoed under Luo Tian's feet. Fei Jiutian's body trembled, emitting a low roar. But its gray body showed cracks, with gray energy flowing out from the fissures.

"Boom!" On the other side, the golden sealing heaven's seal descended and crushed Yu Fan Tian. There was no surprise—Yu Fan Tian's body also crashed to the ground.

Seeing Yu Fan Tian crushed on the ground, Luo Tian didn't care about his arm injuries. Man Qi Tuo's fifth step crashed down.

A dull sound echoed, with smoke and gray energy swirling around Luo Tian's massive body. Fei Jiutian's body was annihilated under Luo Tian's feet.

"Ultimately, compared to the real thing, he's still weak. If Fei Jiutian were alive now, his strength would be much greater!" Luo Tian muttered to himself. He ignored Fei Jiutian's annihilation and took his sixth step toward Yu Fan Tian, who had just recovered.

A terrifying step surged, directly stomping on Yu Fan Tian's body. This made Yu Fan Tian follow Fei Jiutian's fate.

"Finished!" Luo Tian's face bore coldness. He gazed at Qiu Jingming, moving his body toward him.

"Roar..." But as Luo Tian moved, a gray seal descended from above his head. Two identical figures in gray robes appeared before him—these were the Yin Yang Holy Princes, who had been killed by Luo Tian.

They had fought against the trial participants and slain them. Then they targeted Luo Tian, driven by resentment. Most of their targets were Luo Tian; some had been blocked by others.

"Yin Yang Holy Princes?" Luo Tian's face bore coldness. His left hand released the Divine King Nine Heavens Map, and his right hand launched the Sealing Heaven's Seal. At the same time, his seventh step crashed down, instantly killing them.

Luo Tian's entire body radiated overwhelming power. His strength was fully unleashed as he rushed toward Qiu Jingming, killing every former opponent along the way. Each of his former enemies fell under his hands.

Others also continuously attacked Qiu Jingming's revived people, rushing toward him. They all knew that Qiu Jingming was the key; if they killed him, everything would be resolved.

However, at this moment, everyone's strength was fully revealed. Some were trapped and couldn't break free; only a few could rush toward Qiu Jingming.

Long Jie, Nan Gong Yuqing, Yan Hongtao, Zhu Ge Jie, and Zhou Wei—these were the contemporaries of Luo Tian's era. Though their speed wasn't as fast as Luo Tian's, they continuously approached Qiu Jingming.

Zhu Ge Qingtian, Yao Chen, Run Hongyu, and Jun Wulei, along with Wu Wang—these four were no slower than Luo Tian. They continuously advanced.

"You go ahead; we'll handle the rest!" Sun Mengru and Jiang Nanxuan shouted. Their strength wasn't inferior to Yan Hongtao's group, but they chose to block the revived people for everyone.

As for Du Hongxi, Guan Yuxin, and Ma Xiuzhen, they didn't rush toward Qiu Jingming. They had died once in the Red Battlefield and weren't willing to risk their lives.

Time passed slowly. The battle continued, with powerful waves rising constantly as if they would pierce through the battlefield.

"Qiu Jingming, I'm coming!" After fighting for an hour, Luo Tian was within three hundred feet of Qiu Jingming.

Yao Chen and Run Hongyu followed closely behind, their overwhelming auras rising like several suns. They gazed at Qiu Jingming.

"Roar..." At this moment, there were no revived people between them and Qiu Jingming. Only the surging residual souls roared toward Luo Tian's group.

"Shi..." Seven-colored flames rose again. Luo Tian erected a seven-colored flame barrier, enclosing everyone and rushing toward Qiu Jingming.

"So fast?" Seeing Luo Tian's group rush toward him, Qiu Jingming's face slightly paused. His brows furrowed tightly but then relaxed.

"Although it's a bit faster than I expected, it's nothing major!" Qiu Jingming smiled playfully. His hands moved again, and gray rune chains flew from his hands.

"Crack..." Runes covered the red earth. A crackling sound echoed again, and a powerful aura radiated from the gray rune chains. A gray old man materialized before Qiu Jingming.

"Luotian, do you recognize this person?" Qiu Jingming smiled playfully, gazing at Luo Tian's group who were now only a hundred feet away.

Gray face, gray robes. The old man stood before Qiu Jingming, but the entire red battlefield trembled with his appearance. A powerful pressure radiated from him, causing Luo Tian's group to stop.

"Epoch Lord's aura!" Yao Chen gasped, his eyes filled with disbelief as he gazed at the old man before Qiu Jingming.

Wu Wang and Jun Wulei also showed expressions of shock. As children of Epoch Lords, they were most familiar with the aura of an Epoch Lord.

Overwhelming the world, pushing forward, invincible for an epoch. The most brilliant person of an epoch appeared before them—how could they not be stunned?

"Master!" Luo Tian's body trembled. His eyes stared intently at the gray-robed old man beside Qiu Jingming. How could he forget? This gray-robed old man was one of his masters, Meng Lingyun, the Master of the Immortal Realm.

But Luo Tian never expected Qiu Jingming had revived Meng Lingyun. A furious killing intent surged within him.

"An Epoch Lord must not be insulted." This was a rule universally accepted by both humanity and the ancient clans. It was respect for the strong. But now Qiu Jingming had revived Meng Lingyun and aimed to attack his disciple.

"Recognize it? This is your master, right? You must be surprised to see your master again. Don't thank me too much!" Qiu Jingming smiled, gazing at Luo Tian.

"Is this the entrance to the Underworld?" Luo Tian muttered, recalling when he and Meng Lingyun had sealed the Underworld's entrance with their blood.

"Yes, it is. The entrance to the Underworld. Enjoy it, kid!" Qiu Jingming smiled, then pointed his finger. Meng Lingyun's gray eyes radiated waves of light. He stepped forward before Qiu Jingming, his gray hand forming and striking toward Luo Tian's group.

"Buzz..." The humming echoed. In the next moment, the gray hand hovered above Luo Tian's group. An overwhelming aura accompanied by immense pressure enveloped them.

"Damn it!" Seeing the gray hand, Yao Chen's group's faces changed. Under this overwhelming pressure, they felt their movements were restricted.

"This is an Epoch Lord! Though his state isn't at peak, it's still beyond Luo Tian's group to handle!" Zheng Xin and others fought while keeping a distance. They felt Meng Lingyun's powerful aura, worrying for Luo Tian's group.

"Boom..." As everyone was shocked, the gray hand thundered down toward Luo Tian's group.

"Smash a Thousand Enemies!" Yao Chen's eyes flashed with battle spirit. Even if it was an Epoch Lord revived, he wasn't afraid. His golden staff swung out, radiating ten thousand feet of light, striking toward the gray hand.

"Sealing Heaven's Hand..." Jun Wulei followed closely. His golden hand struck, meeting the massive gray hand like a cloud.

"Cut Water with a Blade!" Wu Wang roared, using his martial art for the first time since emerging. A mountain-cutting blade sliced through the sky, its powerful aura flying toward the gray hand.

Run Hongyu and Zhu Ge Qingtian also attacked. Four powerful martial arts, with astonishing waves, rose.

Faced with a revived Epoch Lord, they all fought with their full strength. They didn't hold back. Four powerful martial arts, with overwhelming power, would have left even a second-life strong person in trouble.

But Luo Tian didn't attack. His gaze remained fixed on Meng Lingyun standing there. Though he wasn't a traditionalist, it felt wrong for a disciple to attack his master.

"Boom... boom... boom..." As Luo Tian was stunned, the four powerful martial arts collided with the gray hand that Meng Lingyun had struck.
