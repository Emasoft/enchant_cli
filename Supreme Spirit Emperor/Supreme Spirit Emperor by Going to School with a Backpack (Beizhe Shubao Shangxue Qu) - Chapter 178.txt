“Half-step Transcendent!” Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuqing’s faces bore a faint smile. They exchanged glances, their eyes gleaming with arrogance before locking onto Jiang Yi’s avatar.

“You go? Or shall I?” Luo Tian lightly stroked his black demonic sword, addressing Nan Gong Yuqing.

“Let’s do it together!” Nan Gong Yuqing’s body radiated black qi, condensing into a swirling vortex that materialized before Jiang Yi. With a single slash, he launched himself forward.

At the very moment Nan Gong Yuqing moved, Jiang Yi’s heart jolted. His every hair stood on end as an overwhelming sense of peril surged within him.

He lunged forward with a fist, golden light clashing against black qi in stark contrast. A terrifying surge of energy erupted instantly. In the next moment, Jiang Yi’s face contorted in alarm as he recoiled, colliding with Broken God Cliff.

Nan Gong Yuqing’s expression brimmed with unbridled arrogance. He kicked off the ground, surging forward toward Jiang Yi’s retreat.

“It’s my turn!” As Nan Gong Yuqing moved, Luo Tian let out a triumphant laugh. His body radiated black light, tearing through space to appear before Jiang Yi. The obsidian longsword in his grasp emitted a resonant hum, slicing directly into Jiang Yi’s golden aura.

“Pfth!” The sword pierced his body, a frigid chill seeping into Jiang Yi’s flesh. A deep gash split across his shoulder.

“Take this!” Luo Tian delivered a kick to Jiang Yi’s chest, sending him hurtling back toward Nan Gong Yuqing.

The onlookers gaped at the battered Jiang Yi in the sky, their minds awash with fear at Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuqing’s might.

“That’s a Half-step Transcendent—like a ball, tossed back and forth between them!” A Baihu Sect disciple muttered, watching Jiang Yi’s former arrogance crumble.

The young man who had summoned Jiang Yi wore an expression of boundless shock. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuqing to be so formidable, even defeating Jiang Yi’s avatar.

“Damn you! How dare you treat me like this!” Jiang Yi seethed internally. He was no mere mortal—within the Divine Beasts Domain, he was a renowned powerhouse. Yet now, two Nine-source Celestials had reduced him to this pitiful state.

Yet the only reply was Luo Tian’s foot, slamming into Jiang Yi’s face and sending him flying back toward Nan Gong Yuqing.

“You’re so mighty, so arrogant, so noble—what are you now?” Luo Tian sneered. Together with Nan Gong Yuqing, they repeatedly kicked Jiang Yi without lifting a hand.

“Let’s finish this,” Luo Tian said with a smirk to Nan Gong Yuqing.

At this moment, Jiang Yi had lost consciousness. His body was a ruin of wounds, his head swollen.

“Reversing Heaven Seven Demon Blades!” Nan Gong Yuqing’s voice rang coldly. A flash of killing intent crossed his face as he swung his black sword, its obsidian glow slicing through the air toward Jiang Yi’s waist.

“Crack!” The blade pierced Jiang Yi’s body, blood gushing forth in a crimson spray.

“Hmph. Truly a Transcendent-level powerhouse—this first strike of Reversing Heaven Seven Demon Blades still couldn’t sever you,” Luo Tian mused with a sigh.

Reversing Heaven Seven Demon Blades was a technique taught by an old man and the demon-possessed entity to Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuqing. Combined with their demonic state, it could slay Nine-source Celestials with a single strike.

“Second strike!” Luo Tian chuckled, his black longsword transforming into a blinding blade of light. The sky darkened as the obsidian radiance seemed to pierce through space, its overwhelming pressure weighing upon all present.

“What… what is this martial art!” People’s faces contorted in fear. Some with low cultivation collapsed to the ground, trembling as they spoke.

“This surpasses Imperial-level techniques—it rivals legendary Saint-level arts!” Jiang Sixi’s eyes flashed with intensity, her gaze fixed on Luo Tian’s black blade.

“Pfth!” Under Luo Tian’s strike, Jiang Yi’s body finally split in two, dissolving into a mist of blood that drifted through the heavens. Crimson blood still carried faint golden glimmers, splattering onto Broken God Cliff.

“Hum…” Jiang Yi’s blood was instantly absorbed by Broken God Cliff. After consuming his blood, the old man within the cliff slowly opened his eyes—two lightning bolts piercing through the mountain wall.

“Thank you,” a low voice echoed within Broken God Cliff. This time, unlike before, the old man’s voice was clearly heard by Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuqing.

Luo Tian’s heart clenched involuntarily. A flicker of fear crossed his face before he exchanged glances with Nan Gong Yuqing, discovering the same terror in his eyes.

“No wonder Broken God Cliff is called a forbidden zone. Within its cliffs lies such a terrifying presence—anyone who enters meets death!” Luo Tian trembled, his demonic sword slicing through the air to behead the young man.

Nan Gong Yuqing understood Luo Tian’s intent. His black blade swept through the group of divine beings, wreaking havoc.

Limbs flew through the air. Crimson blood was absorbed by Broken God Cliff again, but now it struck Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuqing with new dread.

After eliminating the divine beings, they swiftly flew to Jiang Sixi’s position. Not daring to linger, Luo Tian barked: “Retreat!”

Nan Gong Yuqing was even more decisive. Seizing the moment, he vanished from sight at maximum speed.

“Huh?” The onlookers heard Luo Tian’s urgent words, their faces bewildered. Why was he so desperate? Jiang Yi and others were already defeated—why did they still hesitate to leave?

“Are you deaf? If you don’t want to die, get out now!” Luo Tian’s roar snapped them back to their senses.

“Retreat!” Jiang Sixi, though unaware of the reason for Luo Tian’s urgency, knew something terrible was happening. She ordered the Tianyuan Sect disciples to retreat. As for those who had defected, she cared little about their fates.

“Yes!” After these events, Jiang Sixi’s status within the Tianyuan Sect was finally solidified. Fourty thousand people, without hesitation, transformed into streaks of light, departing in unison from Broken God Cliff.

The remaining onlookers saw the Tianyuan Sect leave and realized staying was pointless. They followed in their wake, vanishing from Broken God Cliff.

“Boom!” After the crowd disappeared, a thunderous roar echoed through Broken God Cliff. Mist billowed from its depths, shrouding the entire cliff in an impenetrable veil.

Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuqing stood outside the cliff, their expressions grave. “I feel this entity within the mountain is even stronger than the Elder,” Luo Tian murmured.

“I share that feeling. This Broken God Cliff is truly terrifying—its very presence evokes fear,” Luo Tian whispered, sensing the cliff now seemed like a slumbering ancient beast, ready to devour all.

“Unexpectedly, even the Four Sacred Star Domains harbor such terrifying beings. Whether it’s a blessing or curse remains to be seen,” Luo Tian mused, his heart heavy with unease.

“Let’s go. Worrying won’t help. First, we must ascend to Transcendent. Though Jiang Yi’s avatar was destroyed, his true self is a genuine Transcendent. Even with our current state, using the Demon Possession technique to unleash the Seventh Strike of Reversing Heaven Seven Demon Blades, we still wouldn’t match Jiang Yi!” Nan Gong Yuqing sighed, his eyes alight with determination.

“Right. Ascend to Transcendent! But first, we must resolve the sect war,” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with cold determination. His gaze turned toward Baihu Sect and Zhuque Sect.

“The divine beings have extended their claws into the Four Sacred Star Domains. Clearly, their ambitions go beyond merely unifying the Divine Beasts Domain!” Nan Gong Yuqing sighed deeply. His figure flickered, vanishing toward the Eastping Continent and Tianyuan Sect.

Luo Tian also took Jiang Sixi’s hand, leading the Tianyuan Sect disciples in a grand procession toward their sect.

At this moment, outside the Tianyuan Sect, the entire Eastping Continent was drenched in blood. A group of fierce warriors strode through it, their faces alight with excitement as they hunted like predators, mercilessly slaying those who had attacked the Tianyuan Sect.

“Fascinating! You scum dared to provoke us. Speak—what sect are you from?” Tu Hongfei’s face twisted with menace. Though he asked, he gave no chance for a reply. He crushed a three-source Celestial with his bare hands, laughing maniacally as he resembled an executioner.

The sky above Eastping Continent rained corpses, sending its people into terror. Neither commoners nor cultivators dared to step outside.

Jiang Yimeng’s lips twitched as she watched these fierce warriors arrive three days ago. She wondered where they had come from.

Chapter 828: Please Trust Me

Amidst the endless stars, Luo Tian led his group through three days of travel, finally arriving at Eastping Continent’s outskirts, their bodies weary.

Standing outside the continent, they caught whiffs of blood and heard cries of battle. Luo Tian’s brows furrowed slightly.

“Probably Baihu Sect disciples,” they landed on the continent, their frowns easing as they saw the battlefield nearing its end.

“Indeed, these are the criminals from Hulao Star. They’ve already eliminated them without our help!” Luo Tian remarked, marveling at the ferocity of Hulao Star’s criminals.

“Give them a chance. These people might know someone among you. Go persuade them to surrender. If they refuse, kill them!” Luo Tian addressed the recently subdued Baihu Sect disciples and their affiliated sects.

“This…” They looked hesitant, but seeing Luo Tian’s eyes darkening, they gritted their teeth and rushed out to confront their former brethren.

Luo Tian led the group into the sky above Tianyuan Sect, observing its unchanged state with a smile.

“Master!” Jiang Yimeng approached with two six-source Celestial elders, her face alight with excitement as she bowed before Luo Tian.

“Rise. You’ve worked hard these days,” Luo Tian gently helped her up, noting the exhaustion on her face. His voice was warm.

“I’m fine,” Jiang Yimeng sighed, clearly drained from these days of hardship.

Luo Tian and Jiang Sixi hadn’t been gone long when Baihu Sect disciples and their affiliated sects arrived. Initially, they surrounded Tianyuan Sect to demand surrender. Jiang Yimeng refused, sending messages for Luo Tian’s rescue while stalling them.

All of Tianyuan Sect’s Celestial-level and above had been taken by Jiang Sixi. Only a few Boundary-Transcendent disciples remained—no match for Baihu Sect.

Jiang Yimeng stalled for two days before Baihu Sect’s leader lost patience, issuing an attack order.

Moments later, Tianyuan Sect suffered heavy casualties. Had it not been for the great formation set by Xuanwu Old Tortoise, Tianyuan Mountain might have already been reduced to ruins.

At this critical moment, dozens of thousands arrived from the sky—ferocious warriors who killed indiscriminately. Several unfortunate Tianyuan disciples died in the collision’s aftermath. Later, Jiang Yimeng recalled all disciples into Tianyuan Sect, escaping destruction.

Baihu Sect’s forces were no match for these warriors. They had no time to care about Tianyuan Sect, constantly hunted and reduced from a million to just tens of thousands.

Though Tianyuan Sect was temporarily saved, Jiang Yimeng remained shaken. These warriors were too fierce—almost devouring people alive.

“Master, who are they? Are they reinforcements?” Jiang Yimeng asked after recounting the events, her face filled with concern.

Luo Tian nodded slightly, his eyes satisfied. He hadn’t expected Hulao Star’s criminals to be so powerful.

“Hulao Star disciples! I’m back!” Luo Tian’s voice wasn’t loud, but it echoed across Eastping Continent, reaching every Hulao Star disciple.

“H… Hulao Star?” Jiang Yimeng’s mouth gaped open, her face filled with disbelief. As a former Qinglong Sect disciple, she knew what Hulao Star was. She hadn’t expected Luo Tian to have recruited these people.

The two six-source Celestials behind Jiang Yimeng also wore expressions of shock, their minds sighing. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to achieve this.

“Haha! Deputy Sect Master, we’re back!” Tu Hongfei laughed, addressing the Hulao Star disciples. Streaks of light pierced the sky toward Tianyuan Mountain.

“Let’s go, brothers! We should kill more than Tu Hongfei!” Ma Yingming smiled, leading a group toward Tianyuan Mountain’s outskirts.

“Ten thousand… twenty thousand…” Within moments, over eighty thousand people appeared at Tianyuan Mountain’s perimeter.

These eighty thousand warriors seemed like demons from hell, their aura of ferocity radiating skyward.

“This group alone equals two million!” A six-source elder murmured, awe in his eyes. They hadn’t expected Hulao Star to be so fierce.

“Respect the Deputy Sect Master!” The eighty thousand shouted in unison, their gazes toward Luo Tian filled with gratitude and reverence. Without him, they would still be trapped in Hulao Star’s darkness.

“Lao Ma, how many did you kill?” Tu Hongfei asked Ma Yingming with interest.

“Around forty-five thousand,” Ma Yingming shrugged, his eyes gleaming with pride.

“Damn it, I admit defeat. In group combat, I’m no match for you!” Tu Hongfei laughed loudly, causing people to grimace.

“Fascinating! They even compare kills!” People muttered in their minds, cursing these people for being so变态.

“Alright, everyone rest. I have more tasks for you,” Luo Tian smiled, instructing Jiang Yimeng to arrange the eighty thousand and the forty thousand from Broken God Cliff.

Jiang Yimeng, now accustomed to leading the sect, swiftly organized them.

Among the twenty thousand Hulao Star survivors, over ten thousand chose to submit. A few thousand were permanently buried in Eastping Continent, all dispersed and integrated by Jiang Yimeng.

Chapter 829: The Eve of Battle

Within the Four Sacred Star Domains, an inexplicable silence had fallen. Especially Zhuque Sect and Baihu Sect, both now unusually quiet.

People knew this was the calm before a storm. The cause? A new rising power—Tianyuan Sect.

Luo Tian’s name resurfaced in the Four Sacred Star Domains. A Nine-source Celestial, equal to Sha Cangmang and others.

More astonishing was the rumor that Baihu Sect’s Grandmaster had burned his essence to escape Luo Tian. This news spread like wildfire, making Luo Tian’s name shine even brighter.

Besides Luo Tian, another force became the focus of discussion—more precisely, a bandit group. This group roamed the Four Sacred Star Domains’ critical points, seemingly at odds with the four sects. They raided them and their affiliated sects.

Most sects in the Four Sacred Star Domains were under the four sects’ influence. Thus, this bandit group had plundered most of them.

Some claimed to have seen the Heavenly River Four Bandits’ ships. Now, another bandit group appeared. Rumors spread that they were the Heavenly River Four Bandits.

This news of the bandit group’s return in the Four Sacred Star Domains spread like a storm, causing people to panic.

Yet this group had two sects spared—Xuanwu Sect and the newly risen powerhouse, Tianyuan Sect.

“Damn it! Who dares to impersonate our Heavenly River Four Bandits’ name for plundering!” On a starry night, two seven-source Celestials cursed, shaking the stars.

“Brother Two, we can’t take this blame!” Ren Hongzhe of the Heavenly River Four Bandits glared.

“Indeed, shouldn’t we pull off a big heist to clear our name?” Lu Xingzu’s eyes flashed with anger.

Lin Yangzhi frowned, his gaze deep. He hadn’t wanted to get involved initially, but the lack of clarification made him uneasy.

“Let’s search for a few more days. If we can’t find the culprits, we’ll go back and destroy them!” Lin Yangzhi’s eyes darkened with intent.

Chapter 830: The Battle Begins

Outside Eastping Continent, under the endless stars, a heavy atmosphere radiated from both sides. The onlookers from Xuanwu Sect and Qinglong Sect felt a powerful pressure.

“Kid, with these people, you dare to fight us?” Ko Zhen Tian sneered. Two sides’ strength was clearly imbalanced—numbers alone made Baihu Sect and Zhuque Sect’s forces double Tianyuan Sect’s.

“They’re not enough. What about us?” A cold voice echoed as Nan Gong Yuqing and his Hulao Star forces appeared.

Nan Gong Yuqing’s group numbered around a hundred thousand, but their aura of bloodlust made people shudder.

After this period’s training, these hundred thousand had improved their strength. Their combined techniques were formidable—hundreds of thousands moving as one, without chaos.

“Elite! Absolute elite!” People thought upon seeing them.

Luo Tian smiled, watching the hundred thousand land behind him. He gazed at Ko Zhen Tian: “Now, is it enough?”

“They’re the Hulao Star criminals!” Ko Zhen Tian’s face showed disbelief. He stared at Tu Hongfei and Ma Yingming behind Luo Tian, realizing Luo Tian had truly subdued Hulao Star.

“They’re the bandits!” A six-source Celestial from both sects looked shocked, staring at the bloodthirsty group above.

“Indeed! It was Tianyuan Sect all along who plundered us!” Someone shouted, their voice filled with resentment.

“Why didn’t we suspect it was our own people? How could they suffer losses!”

People kept shouting, but none dared to get involved. Now Tianyuan Sect was too powerful.

“Kid, you’re beyond limits! Not only did you free Hulao Star’s criminals, but you even let them plunder the Four Sacred Star Domains. Today, Zhuque Sect and Baihu Sect will represent the Four Sacred Star Domains to exterminate you, restoring peace!” Ko Zhen Tian spoke with a solemn face.

“Hmph. What are you? We know how they entered Hulao Star better than you. Don’t act noble here. I didn’t fear you in Zhuque Sect, and I still don’t now!” A Hulao Star six-source Celestial cursed Ko Zhen Tian without fear.

“Exactly! You think too highly of yourself. When Tianyuan Continent was destroyed, we didn’t see your strength. Now you want to kill Luo Tian who escaped from Tianyuan Continent? Use卑鄙 excuses! I’ve never seen such hypocrites!” Hulao Star warriors sneered.

“Tianyuan Continent?” Onlookers looked puzzled. Hearing Hulao Star warriors mention it, they were curious about the hidden stories between the four sects and these people.

“Die! Kill!” Ko Zhen Tian’s face darkened. He had no more words with Luo Tian and others, barking at his forces.

“Kill!” The roar echoed. Zhuque Sect and Baihu Sect’s forces rushed toward Luo Tian.

“Getting angry?” Luo Tian smiled, watching the one million warriors charging like a flood.

“Kill!” He ordered his group. His spear radiated cold light, humming as it rested in his hand. His Nine-source strength surged forward, facing the one million warriors’ overwhelming pressure without fear.

Simultaneously, Nan Gong Yuqing, Jiang Sixi, Ma Yingming, and Tu Hongfei rushed forward with Luo Tian.
