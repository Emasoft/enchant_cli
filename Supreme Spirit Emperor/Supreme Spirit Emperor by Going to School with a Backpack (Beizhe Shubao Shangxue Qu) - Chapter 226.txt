“Don’t say that,” two masters at the peak of Sainthood addressed Luo Tian, their gazes unusually solemn as they regarded Long Jie with a flicker of respect.

“Ah…” Luo Tian felt at a loss, not alone in his bewilderment; others too had twitching corners of their mouths. Who wouldn’t be unsettled when addressed as elder by a group of old men?

“Those people are decades older than Luo Tian, yet they call him elder! My heavens!” Xu Liyi and others thought in alarm.

“Those are two masters at the peak of Sainthood, figures of legendary power within their sects! Yet they address a boy as elder—truly…” murmured the crowd, speechless.

“Respected elder, you truly humiliate a junior!” Luo Ting sighed with a wry smile, his heart trembling. He glanced at the eighteen men and gave a slight bow.

“You need not be so formal; though our elder has had some issues, he remains our elder!” The old men’s faces bore determination as they gazed at Luo Tian.

“Never mind, elder,” Long Jie shook his head, addressing Luo Tian. “I’ve tried to reason with them for ages, but they wouldn’t listen.”

“They all entered the Ancient Palace of Heaven after me. For years, these eighteen have never left!” Long Jie shook his head, gazing at the altar where radiant light flowed.

“Haha, elder, we set the rules for this level!” a burly man spoke, his voice laced with amusement.

Before Luo Tian and the others could respond, people from the Demon Realm nearby widened their eyes, staring at the burly man.

“You are Elder Xiong Kai Shan of the Bear Clan, aren’t you? I’ve seen your portrait in the Bear Clan’s territory! I thought you perished after leaving!” Feng Jiutian exclaimed, his voice laced with disbelief.

“Ah, so you’re from the Demon Realm… Feng Clan? Dragon Clan? Excellent—five of the Eight Sacred Clans have reached this point!” Xiong Kai Shan smiled awkwardly, greeting Feng Jiutian and others.

“You are Ye Hongtai, a prodigy of the Divine Realm’s independent cultivators! You’ve also entered this Ancient Palace of Heaven!” The people from the Divine Realm quickly spotted a familiar face among the crowd.

The same happened with the Starry Sky Domain’s people, who found their former prodigies. None had expected to meet these once-renowned talents from their respective domains here.

“Fire Domain and the Four Sacred Star Domains—none have come?” A robust elder at the peak of Sainthood stepped forward from the crowd.

“We hail from the Four Sacred Star Domains; these two are from the Fire Domain!” Xu Liyi shrugged indifferently, addressing the middle-aged man.

“I’d like to ask—how is the Gu Family faring now?” The elder’s face bore a trace of anxiety as he looked at Luo Tian and others.

“The Gu Family? Does the elder have a connection with them?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, gazing at the elder.

“My name is Gu Yuansun, fourth-generation descendant of Grand Elder Gu Tianshu!” The elder sighed, his voice tinged with emotion.

…

Chapter 992: Chaos Unleashed

In the fifth level of the Ancient Palace of Heaven, a hall filled with people clashing violently. Luo Tian gazed at the elder before him, surprised to find this man was also a figure of Grand Elder Gu Tianshu’s lineage—fourth-generation descendant, no doubt having lived many years.

“Respected elder, the Gu Family is doing well; their lineage remains unbroken!” Luo Tian smiled, revealing his identity and the Gu Family’s current state. As for Grand Elder Gu Tianshu still being alive, Luo Tian conveyed it via mental transmission to Gu Yuansun. After all, the fact that Grand Elder Gu Tianshu still lived was too significant; fewer people knowing it was better.

Gu Yuansun’s face bore a sigh of emotion, surprised that the Gu Family and Fire Domain had declined so severely. Few Saint-High masters remained in the Fire Domain.

Gu Yuansun recounted his years of experiences. Once, he had been a prodigy himself, though not as formidable as Grand Elder Gu Tianshu. Yet he had been hailed as the strongest genius of the Fire Domain at that time. Back then, the Gu Family was flourishing; Grand Elder Gu Tianshu had been restrained by Heaven but hadn’t yet declined. As a prodigy of the Gu Family, he had been proud. He had wandered through other domains and accidentally entered this Ancient Palace of Heaven.

What Gu Yuansun didn’t know was that his disappearance had led to the Gu Family’s decline after his generation.

Gu Yuansun naturally knew that entering this Ancient Palace of Heaven might have caused the Gu Family’s downfall. Yet he had no choice; within this Ancient Palace of Heaven, one could only be transported out by comprehending the Epoch Seal. Otherwise, there was no other way.

“Respected elder, don’t blame yourself; the Gu Family is doing well now. Everything is moving in a positive direction. Once we leave this palace, I’ll introduce you to your family’s descendants!” Luo Tian smiled, addressing Gu Yuansun.

“The Gu Family’s descendants!” Gu Yuansun’s face lit with excitement, but it quickly turned sorrowful.

“To escape, how difficult it is! Unless one comprehends the Epoch Seal on that altar, one cannot be transported out!” Gu Yuansun sighed, gazing at the massive altar nearby.

Others also greeted their respective elders from their domains. In this Ancient Palace of Heaven, meeting one’s hometown people was comforting. Especially since these were geniuses at the Saint-Middle and Saint-High levels; if they could be taken out and joined their sects, it would be a significant boost. Those who had reached this fifth level had already proven their talent.

“Enough, everyone—this reunion ends here!” Three elders emerged slowly into view, the three guardians of the second to fourth levels—the three artifact spirits of this Ancient Palace of Heaven.

Hearing the artifact spirits’ words, people instinctively turned their gazes toward them, eyes filled with solemnity. They knew the final trial of this Ancient Palace of Heaven was approaching.

“Everyone, I assume your elders have told you how to escape this Ancient Palace of Heaven!”

“In the past, those who comprehended the Epoch Seal could be transported out through this altar—this is the only method!” The three artifact spirits smiled.

“But this time differs from before; otherwise, we wouldn’t have gathered so many of you in the fifth level!” The plump artifact spirit spoke slowly, easing people’s minds.

Epoch Seals—just the name suggested difficulty. Anything related to an epoch was never simple. Didn’t two masters at the peak of Epoch Seals still hadn’t left?

“Xuanzong…” Luo Tian felt awkward, gazing at Gu Yuansun. Once, they had called him elder; now he was his junior, by countless generations—Grand Elder status.

Gu Yuansun also felt awkward, gazing at Luo Tian before letting out a light laugh and patting his shoulder: “Alright, let’s each stick to our own!”

“I mean what I said—this time, everyone has a chance to escape. Of course, you may also choose to comprehend the Epoch Seal! Both methods are viable!” The elder spoke, his voice laced with a smile.

“No one may comprehend the Epoch Seal!” Long Jie spoke solemnly, his voice heavy with gravity. Luo Tian and others stiffened, their gazes filled with confusion as they looked at Long Jie.

“This Epoch Seal was left by an Epoch-level master, containing that master’s comprehension. If one fully grasps it, they might ascend to the Epoch level—but forever remain at the initial stage of Epoch, unable to progress further!” Long Jie shook his head. He had once been skeptical, fully comprehending the seal and escaping this Ancient Palace of Heaven. Though his power was immense, he had ultimately perished at the brink of ascending to the next stage.

“Correct—comprehending it is unwise. If one does, it will hinder future cultivation. The best outcome would be reaching the initial stage of Epoch; advancing further becomes nearly impossible, for it is another’s comprehension, another’s path—unrealized by oneself!” The elder guarding the Bloodthirsty Martial Weapon spoke ominously, scanning the crowd.

“If it weren’t for this, we would have left long ago and wouldn’t be stuck here for years. From young prodigies to old grumps!” A Saint-High master spoke softly, his voice tinged with nostalgia.

Luo Tian and others had just entered and were still at the Saint-Initial stage, unaware of the Epoch Seal’s true purpose. Their faces bore contemplation.

To them, ascending to the Epoch level was a monumental opportunity. Many had never reached it in their lives; countless prodigies remained trapped at the Saint-High level.

Now, no Epoch-level masters existed across the Nine Domains—Epoch level was now a godlike presence.

Yet Luo Tian knew the Nine Domains were about to change; Epoch-level masters might reappear. Prodigies would bloom, ultimately culminating in one becoming the supreme Epoch Lord.

Sun Mengru, Feng Jiutian, and others hailed from major sects with deep roots. Naturally, they knew the Nine Domains were likely to undergo a massive shift—unseen masters who had sealed themselves away would emerge.

“This time is different because this Ancient Palace of Heaven will have a master, and that master shall be chosen among you!” The three elders smiled softly, yet the entire hall fell silent.

Feng Jiutian, Sun Feiwen, even the usually composed Zhou Wei had quickened breaths, their faces flushed as they gazed at the three elders.

All eyes were burning with desire. Though none knew what level of treasure this Ancient Palace of Heaven was, it was undoubtedly a rare and precious artifact—surpassing even pseudo-Epoch treasures.

Luo Tian sighed deeply, knowing the Ancient Palace of Heaven’s true value. The treasure forged by an Epoch Lord—how precious it was, unmatched across the Nine Domains.

If this Ancient Palace of Heaven had a master, others could escape naturally; after all, it was now another’s possession.

“You eighteen may participate in the trial. Each of your four factions shall send one representative!” The plump artifact spirit spoke, scanning Luo Tian and Feng Jiutian.

“Ugh, so not everyone has a chance!” Diao Dedu grumbled, his face sour. Others too bore disappointed expressions.

“Kid, don’t be grateful for the opportunity and then act like a brat! If it weren’t for this special opening of the palace, your life might’ve already been lost!” The blood-tinged artifact spirit spoke sharply, scanning those who had grumbled.

“Haha, enough, elder three—don’t scare them!” The elder guarding the Epoch Bell spoke, his gaze kind toward everyone.

“You have ten breaths to decide; if you don’t decide soon, it’s as if you’ve formally renounced your chance!” The plump artifact spirit looked at the group still staring at each other, reminding them.

“Hum…” The elder’s words had barely finished when the entire hall resonated with a hum. People quickly exchanged mental transmissions, discussing who had the best chance.

But only moments passed before Luo Tian, Feng Jiutian, Sun Mengru, and Zhou Wei emerged from their respective factions. Their faces bore fierce determination; a battle spirit rose among them, locking eyes with one another as lightning clashed between their gazes.

Everyone turned to the four; they were undoubtedly the strongest prodigies within this Ancient Palace of Heaven, their auras terrifyingly powerful.

“Finally, we can witness the clash between four! How exciting!” People’s eyes gleamed with excitement. Seeing such a powerful prodigy battle was rare indeed.

“We’ve decided!” One Saint-High elder spoke, gazing at the three artifact spirits before turning to Long Jie. “We wish to directly let our elder become the master of this Ancient Palace of Heaven!”

“Ah…” The three artifact spirits were stunned. Others too murmured in surprise, not expecting Long Jie’s status to be so high that he was willing to forgo the competition.

Long Jie too was stunned, not expecting the elder’s words were genuine. A look of emotion crossed his face, recalling how after entering this Ancient Palace of Heaven, countless masters had followed him. Over the years, they had forged deep bonds—whether he acknowledged it or not, Long Jie knew he was Long Zhan Tian.

“I disagree!” As people murmured, a deep voice rang out, breaking the stalemate and stirring everyone’s minds.

“Elder Eighteen, you…” A Saint-High elder spoke, his voice rolling down like thunder, drawing everyone’s attention to the usually quiet middle-aged man.

…

Chapter 993: I Disagree

In the fifth level of the Ancient Palace of Heaven, people bore expressions of disbelief as they gazed at the group of ten. These individuals had entered this Ancient Palace of Heaven years ago, and the three artifact spirits’ faces changed—unbelieving that these ten truly wished to yield their chance, favoring Long Jie.

The three artifact spirits had long resided within this Ancient Palace of Heaven, naturally familiar with these ten. They were friends; the three artifact spirits couldn’t easily refute their request.

“Brave indeed!” Xu Liyi and others sighed, gazing at the ten with admiration.

“Elder, though you’ve reincarnated, it cannot be denied that you are still our elder. After so many years of friendship, we won’t forget. So don’t refuse!” Two Saint-High masters spoke solemnly.

“Stubborn fool!” Long Jie shook his head slightly, not speaking but feeling deeply moved. He knew that back when Long Zhan Tian had entered this Ancient Palace of Heaven, these ten had been like brothers. After years together, their bond was deep.

“I disagree!” As the three artifact spirits were at a loss, a deep voice broke the stalemate, stirring everyone’s minds.

“Elder Eighteen, what are you doing?” The two Saint-High masters looked unpleased. When Long Jie had first entered, the man called Elder Eighteen hadn’t been very warm.

But people understood; Elder Eighteen had entered this Ancient Palace of Heaven after Long Zhan Tian, so he wasn’t familiar with him. Thus, they hadn’t taken it too seriously.

“Elder, now you are the elder, not that reincarnated kid. And I’m not familiar with him. So to let me give up my chance at this Ancient Palace of Heaven, do you think that’s fair?” The middle-aged man’s face bore anger as he addressed the leading Saint-High masters.

The seventeen fell silent, indeed—though they had deep bonds with Long Zhan Tian, they had no connection to the later Elder Eighteen.

“Of course, I can let you yield if you defeat me. Otherwise, it’s out of the question!” The middle-aged man’s face bore a fierce glint, gazing at Long Jie.

“I don’t fear you!” Long Jie clearly had pride; though he hadn’t spent long in the fourth level’s Celestial Diagram, his strength had ascended to Saint-Initial. After a surge of anger, he gradually exuded an imperial aura, his blood surged, and dragon-like power rose in the hall.

“Elder Eighteen, what are you doing?” The leading Saint-High masters looked troubled. Both sides were their brothers, but now they stood at odds, caught between them and finding it hard to act.

Zhou Wei was moved; this Elder Eighteen was Ding Wensong, a prodigy of the Starry Sky Domain who had once been renowned. His strength was naturally immense.

The people of the Demon and Divine Realms watched with interest, hoping the two would fight—otherwise, if the Saint-High master’s suggestion was accepted, looking at the three artifact spirits’ expressions, it would indeed be difficult.

“You challenge me? If you win, I’ll acknowledge you as elder; if not, I won’t recognize you. Let your strength speak!” Ding Wensong’s robes fluttered as his Saint-Middle aura radiated.

“Old man, you’re a Saint-Middle master; to fight a Saint-Initial one—do you think that’s fair?” Xu Liyi mocked, clearly intending to prevent Long Jie from being disadvantaged.

“Elder Eighteen, you’re overstepping! If you don’t accept, go back and don’t bother us!” Gu Yuansun scolded, his voice laced with impatience.

“Elder Seven, I hope you don’t interfere; don’t break your brothers’ hearts!” Ding Wensong gazed at the seventeen, his eyes scanning them.

When met with Ding Wensong’s gaze, the seventeen fell silent; they knew this wasn’t their place. Yet Ding Wensong’s strength was known—even Gu Yuansun, a Saint-High master, couldn’t subdue him in a short time.

“I won’t take advantage; I’ll seal my strength and fight on equal terms!” Ding Wensong smiled confidently, his hands moving rapidly. Stars of light flew from his palms, connecting with the world’s momentum before merging into his body. At the same time, his strength rapidly dropped to Saint-Initial level.

“Hmph, if I sealed my strength and fought a half-Saint, would that be fair?” Xu Liyi mocked again, his gaze filled with mockery as he addressed Ding Wensong.

Ding Wensong glanced at Xu Liyi, his eyes cold before nodding seriously: “Fine!”

Ding Wensong only answered with one word, his hands suddenly surged forward. A green palm struck his chest.

“Is he going to injure himself?” People’s faces trembled, shocked that Ding Wensong was so arrogant as to injure himself for a fair fight.

The seventeen elders shook their heads lightly; they knew Ding Wensong was just arrogant, his heart not bad. The main reason was for them, to avoid embarrassment before Long Jie.

The green palm radiated a tremendous surge; this strike could kill an ordinary Saint-Initial master. Ding Wensong didn’t hesitate, striking his chest with all his might.

Just as the green palm was about to hit Ding Wensong’s chest, a low dragon roar echoed through the hall, wind and thunder flashing.

“Enough!” Long Jie suddenly appeared before Ding Wensong, his white hand grasping the descending palm.

“Huh?” Ding Wensong’s eyes flashed with surprise, gazing at Long Jie. Though he had been careless, Long Jie’s speed surprised him.

Moreover, his power was immense; Long Jie had simply blocked it with no expression on his face.

Others too bore strange looks, gazing at Long Jie—even Luo Tian did so, secretly sighing. It had been a long time since he’d seen Long Jie fight; now it seemed his strength had risen rapidly.

After speaking, Long Jie moved his hands, sending a dragon qi from his palm into Ding Wensong’s body. Ding Wensong’s face changed, and a series of dragon roars echoed from his body.

At the same time, Ding Wensong’s aura gradually rose back to Saint-Middle level.

“What does that mean?” Ding Wensong’s face bore confusion; his sealing method was simple, yet no one could break it. Yet Long Jie had simply touched it and broken it—this made Ding Wensong’s eyes more focused.

“Enough; fight until you’re convinced!” Long Jie leapt into the air, standing in midair with a fierce aura. He gazed at Ding Wensong.

“Hiss…” A sound of inhaling cold air spread; people looked at Long Jie as if he were a monster, shocked that he was so arrogant.

To fight a Saint-Middle with a Saint-Initial—this seemed impossible to win. Especially since Ding Wensong wasn’t an ordinary Saint-Middle but a genius, his strength far surpassing most Saint-Middles.

“Arrogant…” People’s first thought was that Long Jie was too arrogant, even more so than Luo Tian. Yet they couldn’t help but admire his courage.

“Elder, your bloodline power hasn’t fully awakened yet; this…” The seventeen elders bore worry.

“Don’t mind!” Long Jie’s eyes gleamed, gazing at Ding Wensong who had flown hundreds of feet ahead. They faced each other across the void, golden light spreading, their battle spirit radiating as invisible waves collided.

The three artifact spirits exchanged glances but didn’t intervene, instead watching the spectacle.

Luo Tian gazed deeply at Long Jie, sensing a strange feeling about him—this serious and arrogant demeanor was one he had never seen on Long Jie before.

“Subconsciously, Long Jie has still been influenced by Long Zhan Tian!” Luo Tian sighed deeply; on a personal level, he hoped Long Jie would return to his carefree self.

“Regardless of the outcome, I’ll acknowledge you—just for your arrogance, I’m impressed. I thought I was arrogant enough, but now I see you’re even more so!” Ding Wensong’s eyes shone as he addressed Long Jie, his voice laced with admiration. Stars of light flowed around him.

“Enough talk; fight!” Long Jie’s face bore indifference and arrogance, his form flashing forward to confront the Saint-Middle without fear.

Ding Wensong, a Saint-Middle master, naturally wouldn’t fear a Saint-Initial—no matter that this person was the reincarnation of the legendary Long Zhan Tian.

Green light flashed; Ding Wensong moved like a meteor, appearing before his opponent without using martial arts. His green and golden fists collided.

“Crack…” The void cracked, invisible waves forming before them. A dragon roared; golden dragons flew out from both sides, roaring toward the surroundings.

In the next moment, Ding Wensong’s form retreated, his face filled with disbelief; his fists bore cracks.

Yet Long Jie stood proudly, his youthful face bearing a mocking smile.

“Fighting with the Dragon Clan’s body strength—this is truly self-destruction! I heard that no one dared to approach within five hundred feet of the Dragon Ancestor!” Diao Dedu’s face bore mockery, shaking his head.

“I’ve always known Long’s body strength was formidable; even I once suffered a loss against him!” Chen Zhanbiao spoke, recalling their first meeting when he had robbed Long Jie. Xu Liyi too sighed.

“Time flies; it feels like yesterday!” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Long Jie charging toward Ding Wensong again. Now, Long Jie had grown; even he felt he was no longer Long Jie’s match.

…

Chapter 994: Imperial Dragon Qi

In the fifth level of the Ancient Palace of Heaven, two figures continuously exchanged blows. Terrifying waves spread outward, lifting people’s robes.

“Already thirty rounds; Long Jie hasn’t suffered a single injury! What kind of body is this!” Xu Liyi spoke softly, his voice laced with disbelief.

“This is only Saint-Initial; if he ascends to Saint-High, no one in the Demon Domain would be his match!” Feng Jiutian and others from the Demon Domain transmitted, their eyes filled with awe as they watched Long Jie—still green-faced but clashing repeatedly with Ding Wensong.

“Indeed, the first among them! Now he has an undefeated stance!” The Divine Domain’s people sighed.

Ding Wensong too was awestruck, his fists riddled with cracks as if about to break. His form was also battered.

“Truly strong—no wonder he was the first! Even reincarnated, his body strength can suppress a Saint-Middle like this!” Ding Wensong sighed inwardly, admiration rising.

“What’s that? He hasn’t even fully awakened his bloodline power yet; if he did, this Ding Wensong would’ve already fallen!” Diao Dedu scoffed, gazing at Long Jie. He recalled his grandfather’s mention of Long Zhan Tian—body strength unmatched, no one dared to challenge it across the Nine Domains. Even Divine Domain’s gods and Death Domain’s masters wouldn’t dare to fight it head-on.

“Crack…” Thunder roared; Long Jie and Ding Wensong retreated, Long Jie standing afar, gazing at Ding Wensong with a scornful look. “Use your martial arts; body strength isn’t your match!”

Ding Wensong’s face was grim. Being called out by a Saint-Initial like this felt humiliating, but it was true—Ding Wensong now felt his body wasn’t his own; internal organs had shifted. If he continued to fight with body strength, he would surely suffer heavy injuries and lose thoroughly.

Though reluctant, Ding Wensong eventually moved his hands, gradually regaining sensation. He pressed his palms together, emitting purple light.

“Be careful; martial arts aren’t like body strength. If you can’t withstand it, call out so I can stop in time!” Ding Wensong warned, his hands moving rapidly.

He then formed complex hand seals, transforming the entire hall into a purple starry sky, an eerie sight.

Long Jie’s calm eyes turned serious; under this purple starry sky, he felt a surge of danger.

“Purple Sky Emperor’s Explosion!” Ding Wensong roared, pressing his palms together rapidly. Each press released a purple star-like spiritual energy, exploding with thunderous sound.

“Elder Eighteen, you’re playing for real!” Including the two Saint-High masters and three artifact spirits, the group’s faces changed, addressing Ding Wensong.

As long-time residents of the palace, they had surely sparred before; thus, they knew each other well. The three artifact spirits were no exception—when free time came, they often chatted with these eighteen. Now seeing Ding Wensong’s martial arts, they knew its power.

Luo Tian and others also changed faces; they could feel the explosion’s terrifying force. Combined with the group’s exclamation, they felt uneasy. Luo Tian tensed his legs; if anything went wrong, he would instantly appear to save Long Jie.

“Good—when I was at half-Saint, maybe I would’ve dodged. But now! No!” Long Jie smiled, his hands changing rapidly; his aura surged skyward. Golden light transformed into dragons circling around him, emitting dragon roars.

“Different—this isn’t spiritual energy!” People’s faces bore confusion; though the golden dragons circling Long Jie seemed like golden spiritual energy, they felt it was stronger than regular spiritual energy.

“I see—it’s…” Diao Dedu widened his eyes, his voice trembling with shock.

“How is it possible! Long Zhan Tian himself never cultivated this! How could he?” Feng Jiutian and others gasped.

Everyone gazed at Long Jie, unaware of what made the golden dragons different. Only the plump artifact spirit guarding the Celestial Diagram smiled, biting into a chicken leg.

“Imperial Dragon Qi!” Diao Dedu spoke slowly, his voice trembling; his entire body shook from the overwhelming pressure of those golden dragons.

“Indeed, Imperial Dragon Qi!” Xiong Kai Shan and Bao Zhiyuan of the Leopard Clan, a Saint-High master, heard Diao Dedu’s words and bore faces of shock. Even they, as Saint-High masters, felt the soul-piercing pressure.

“Hey, dog nose, what’s Imperial Dragon Qi?” Xu Liyi and others asked, their eyes filled with confusion. Even they felt the pressure now, blood seemingly frozen, spiritual energy flow blocked.

“It’s a technique created by an unparalleled master of the Demon Domain. According to age, it predates even Long Zhan Tian. At that time, the world wasn’t restrained; though Epoch-level masters weren’t numerous, there were still many. I heard the Demon Domain once had an Epoch Lord, and this Imperial Dragon Qi was created by that Epoch Lord.”

“Imperial Dragon Qi emerges—everything submits!” Diao Dedu spoke slowly, recounting the grand origin of Imperial Dragon Qi from an Epoch Lord.

“Magnificent!” People marveled at the Epoch Lord’s formidable methods, gazing at the golden dragons coiling around Long Jie.

“This kid truly hides his power! Even Luo Tian might not be this kid’s match!” Xu Liyi and others had twitching mouths, gazing at Long Jie with a serious expression.

Other domains’ people were also stunned; they hadn’t expected the strongest among Luo Tian’s group to be this seemingly green-faced youth.

“Roar…” Nine dragons roared, emitting a terrifying pressure. They entwined, forming a massive energy storm that swept toward Ding Wensong.

“Not yet fully formed—no even close to completion. I heard my grandfather say that this Epoch Lord could form ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine Imperial Dragon Qis. Each could crush an Epoch-High master. Just the pressure alone could subdue a Saint-High!” Diao Dedu spoke, his face filled with envy.

People gasped at Diao Dedu’s words, imagining the Epoch Lord’s supreme methods—terrifying.

“Still, nine isn’t ordinary. I believe with Long Jie’s strength, it can surpass levels!” Diao Dedu was excited.

“Indeed, elder—this technique of the Epoch Lord itself!” The seventeen faces bore excitement; two Saint-High masters moved their hands slightly, preparing to intervene. They guessed this was the decisive clash between the two; if they continued fighting, one would surely suffer heavy injuries—too costly.

“Boom… boom…” The explosions echoed constantly. Ding Wensong’s face was grim; he felt his spiritual energy had declined, but he continued pressing his palms, releasing purple star-like spiritual energies that exploded into a purple dragon. This one too carried terrifying power, charging toward the nine dragons.

One purple, one golden—two terrifying energies entwined, shaking the entire hall. Violent gusts collided, striking people and pushing them back.

“Who won?” People’s faces bore confusion as they gazed at the two shrouded in light, waiting for the battle’s result.

The light faded; two figures appeared in people’s sight—Long Jie and Ding Wensong.

“Victory!” In the view, Long Jie stood in midair, his aura filled with Imperial Dragon Qi, as if the world’s master. He gazed at Ding Wensong, who stood battered on the ground.

“Cough… cough…” Ding Wensong spat two mouthfuls of blood onto the ground, his face bearing admiration. That last strike had clearly injured him.

“Elder, I yield!” Ding Wensong wiped his blood-stained mouth, gazing at Long Jie with admiration. He had been defeated.

To defeat a Saint-Middle with a Saint-Initial—how many people in history could do this? Besides each epoch’s Epoch Lord, no one had ever achieved such a feat. Even Luo Tian had only tied with Saint-Middle Yan Hongtao; though his strength had grown, he wasn’t sure if he could beat Yan Hongtao.

Today, Long Jie had proven that a Saint-Initial could defeat a Saint-Middle, revealing his undefeated potential. If an Epoch Lord were to emerge in the future, Long Jie would surely have a place among them.

“Get up,” Long Jie helped Ding Wensong up, his face filled with nostalgia. He had never imagined he would defeat a Saint-Middle after entering this Ancient Palace of Heaven.

“Three elders, can you now agree with our proposal?” The two Saint-High masters smiled, addressing the three still-dazed artifact spirits. They pulled everyone out of their shock and stupor.

“This…” The three artifact spirits bore hesitation, but they shook their heads lightly: “Everyone knows each other. But I’ve already said it’s not something we three can decide alone. It’s the master’s will; we’re just relaying messages. You know the master’s temperament—when he’s determined, even we three can’t persuade him. So everyone, don’t make it hard for us!”

…

Chapter 995: The Main Artifact Spirit

In the fifth level of the Ancient Palace of Heaven, the three artifact spirits bore hesitation as they gazed at the eighteen masters who had cultivated within this Ancient Palace of Heaven for countless years.

The eighteen heard the three artifact spirits’ words and knew their proposal was likely futile. These eighteen had cultivated within this Ancient Palace of Heaven for years, meeting the three artifact spirits only three times. Even the two Saint-High masters dared not defy the main artifact spirit’s will. In this Ancient Palace of Heaven, that mysterious main artifact spirit was the ruler—no one could defy its will.
