Recalling the scene of the battle just now, Luo Tian still felt his heart tremble. His soul had been weaker than that of the older man, and he had nearly been devoured several times. Yet, at the moment when Luo Tian was about to be consumed, a fragmented soul had appeared within space and instantly merged into his body. It was this that allowed him to barely survive.

Had it not been for this, Luo Tian would have perished completely, his soul annihilated without even a chance to reincarnate.

Luo Tian did not rush to leave. He had now remembered the events that had transpired—when he was in peril, he had been absorbed into the Book of Epochs. Thus, this place was within the Book of Epochs.

Luo Tian had always held deep respect and gratitude for the Book of Epochs. Indeed, without it, he would never have reached this point.

It was no small feat to enter the Book of Epochs, and Luo Tian would not let this opportunity go to waste. Though his near-death experience had little to do with the Book of Epochs, it was the Book that had saved him.

Yet, Luo Tian soon felt disappointment. This grey space seemed boundless, with several soul-piercing presences that made him hesitate to move forward. Even the courage to take a single step eluded him.

Not finding anything remarkable, Luo Tian began to ponder how to exit. Though his body was currently occupied by Qiu Taiping, Luo Tian had not truly died. A vague sense told him that his body was being invaded.

While Luo Tian wandered within the Book of Epochs, Qiu Taiping outside was grim-faced to the extreme.

"Damn you... what the hell are you? Even a heavenly-grade treasure would have been refined by now with my soul energy!" Qiu Taiping roared wildly.

After receiving replenishment from Bu Jingtian's soul, Qiu Taiping had confidently begun refining the Soul-Subduing Cauldron. But as time passed and his soul energy was drained, Qiu Taiping's face turned the color of eggplant.

The computer exploded. Borrowing another person's computer, I typed these two chapters from memory. Please forgive me for this!

Chapter 421: Stay Forever

Chapter 421: Stay Forever

Qiu Taiping had believed that with his restored soul and the souls he had absorbed, including part of Bu Jingtian's soul absorbed by the Soul-Subduing Cauldron, he should have been able to fully refine it. But some things were unpredictable. At this moment, Qiu Taiping's soul had already lost four out of ten parts, yet the Soul-Subduing Cauldron in his storage ring merely trembled slightly. Qiu Taiping could sense that it had already been refined to about seven out of ten.

"Damn!" Qiu Taiping growled. The situation had reached this point, and it was impossible to stop now. Refining the Soul-Subduing Cauldron was not something he could simply abandon.

"Refine it! I won't let you escape!" Qiu Taiping mentally calculated. According to his refining speed, after losing four parts of his soul energy, he would completely refine the Soul-Subduing Cauldron. At that point, his soul energy would be left with about one part.

One part of soul energy was still weak, but it equaled that of a bone-fragmentation peak or even the pinnacle. With his methods, he could recover it, though with some difficulty. Resolute, Qiu Taiping continued to refine it with aching heart.

"One part... two parts... three parts... four parts..." Time passed slowly.

Qiu Taiping's soul energy had completely vanished four parts, leaving only one. Outside, Luo Tian's face was pale to the extreme.

"Haha... success!" Qiu Taiping laughed loudly, and Luo Tian's body also laughed. Even with the wind blocking it, the laughter spread far away.

After Qiu Taiping had paid the price of nine parts of his soul energy, the Soul-Subduing Cauldron was finally refined and became a possession of its own.

"I'll check what makes this Soul-Subduing Cauldron different! It consumed so much of my soul energy, nearly costing me my life!" Qiu Taiping laughed as he sent his spiritual awareness into the storage ring.

However, before Qiu Taiping could even feel joy, golden light filled Luo Tian's mind, filling the entire mental sea and causing Qiu Taiping to be startled.

Amidst the golden light, a golden book slowly rose within the mental sea. The Book of Epochs opened in the golden light, and a figure resembling Luo Tian emerged from the golden light.

"Has he come out?" Luo Tian murmured softly, gazing at the familiar mental sea and a faint smile on his face.

Soul energy quickly surged around him, attempting to regain control of the body.

Qiu Taiping's eyes were stunned, sensing the changes within Luo Tian's mental sea and the presence of the Book of Epochs. His weak soul showed a strong expression of shock.

Then, a powerful repulsion force instantly attacked Qiu Taiping's body, which was almost fully merged with Luo Tian.

"Has he been taken over?" Luo Tian naturally felt his body being occupied, but he noticed something different about it.

"Not only are all the injuries healed, but two more elements have been added?" Luo Tian's mind trembled with joy. He had never imagined that being away from his body for a short time would turn him into a seven-element body.

"Thank you!" Luo Tian naturally felt the extremely weak soul of Qiu Taiping at this moment.

Qiu Taiping's soul, though comparable to the peak of bone-fragmentation, had been surpassed by Luo Tian's spiritual awareness before he was injured. Luo Tian's spiritual awareness had already reached the initial stage of yuanling and was immensely powerful. Moreover, he had devoured countless souls within the Book of Epochs, especially that stronger soul than himself, which had made Luo Tian's soul extremely powerful.

"You! You! You're not dead!" Qiu Taiping's heart trembled. At this moment, he could clearly sense Luo Tian's strength. If he were at his full power, there might have been a chance to fight back.

But now, his soul was at its weakest. Moreover, this body originally belonged to Luo Tian. He had chosen to possess it during the moment when Luo Tian was severely injured and on the brink of death, considering that even with his powerful soul, possessing another's body was no easy task.

Yet Qiu Taiping had never imagined that Luo Tian hadn't died, and his soul was incredibly strong—equalling two parts of his full power.

Qiu Taiping's guess was correct. Luo Tian's soul was indeed extremely powerful, approaching the peak of yuanling. Luo Tian hadn't noticed this because he had not yet sent out his spiritual awareness. If he did, his spiritual awareness would have equaled the peak of yuanling, that is, the pinnacle of refining.

"Since I've returned, there's no need for you to exist anymore!" Luo Tian chuckled lightly. His soul energy spread throughout the mental sea, gradually regaining control of his body like a tide flowing to every part.

Wherever Luo Tian's soul energy reached, Qiu Taiping's soul was devoured completely.

"Little brat!" Qiu Taiping's face showed a mad expression, watching Luo Tian devour his soul bit by bit. His heart was filled with resentment. He had obtained this rare body and refined the Soul-Subduing Cauldron, but now it was all for another's benefit. The thought made Qiu Taiping want to spit blood.

However, Qiu Taiping knew he was no match for Luo Tian in his current state. To minimize losses, he had to withdraw his soul entirely; otherwise, it would be a waste.

Without Qiu Taiping's obstruction, Luo Tian instantly regained control of his body and wore a slight smile.

"Go!" Qiu Taiping didn't even think, having lived for countless years. His eyes showed a hint of regret as his soul energy surged out of Luo Tian's body.

"Since you've stayed here for so long, why not stay forever?" Luo Tian smiled lightly. His powerful soul energy instantly caught up with Qiu Taiping and bit down on him.

"Damn little brat!" Qiu Taiping was about to spit blood. At this moment, he only wanted to escape Luo Tian's body and think of other methods.

But Luo Tian would not let this person go. If it weren't for his fortune, he would have been annihilated.

At the moment Luo Tian saw Qiu Taiping's soul, he had already sentenced him to death—eternal and irreversible.

"Since you've been dead for countless years, there's no need to live on this earth anymore! I'll help you achieve liberation!" Luo Tian laughed wildly while tearing apart Qiu Taiping's soul.

Qiu Taiping was now filled with fear. For the first time, he felt death so close. He had lived for countless years and was even a renowned Emperor of Swallowing Heaven in the ancient immortal era. Now, he was being chased by a little brat that he could have killed with one breath. This feeling made him even more desperate.

If his soul could spit blood, he would have done so already.

Chapter 422: A Good Person

Chapter 422: A Good Person

Qiu Taiping was utterly frustrated. After regaining control of his body, Luo Tian sealed every part of it, leaving no gaps even in the pores. This made Qiu Taiping feel like he had no way to escape, forced to flee endlessly within Luo Tian's body.

Luo Tian followed closely behind Qiu Taiping, continuously devouring his soul. Each part devoured slowed Qiu Taiping's speed.

"Little brat! I'll fight you!" Qiu Taiping roared in his mind, knowing he couldn't escape. He turned around and burned the remaining soul energy to fight Luo Tian.

"If you had done this from the beginning, I might have paid a price. But now it's too late!" Luo Tian's soul coldly sneered, and his form materialized into a tangible shape. He instantly appeared before Qiu Taiping's burning soul and transformed into a giant beast, devouring Qiu Taiping's soul into his body.

"Ugh..." After doing all this, Luo Tian sighed deeply and let his soul energy spread over his body.

Luo Tian's physical body, which had been closed-eyed for a long time, suddenly opened its eyes. A relaxed expression appeared on his face as he felt the strength of his body and was delighted.

"A good person!" Luo Tian sighed, having devoured Qiu Taiping's soul. With it came the memories of Qiu Taiping.

Luo Tian naturally knew that he was now a seven-element body. He felt the memories of Qiu Taiping, who had not only obtained the Wind Thunder Porcelain Heart but also understood the essence of wind and thunder. Moreover, he had mastered the essence of wood and another wood element, making Luo Tian extremely happy.

"A good person! Truly a great one!" Luo Tian's spiritual awareness entered the storage ring and felt that nothing was missing. Especially, the Soul-Subduing Cauldron, which he had previously been unable to control, no longer rejected him. Instead, it sent a sense of familiarity, making Luo Tian exclaim loudly.

"Buzz..." A wave of spiritual energy spread out. The Soul-Subduing Cauldron, with its heavy presence, appeared before Luo Tian.

Luo Tian looked up at the Soul-Subduing Cauldron, which was several zhang taller than him. His lips slightly curled: "Destiny truly is a great blessing!"

His hand gently touched the cauldron's body. With his will, the Soul-Subduing Cauldron quickly shrank to the size of a palm and landed in Luo Tian's hand.

"It truly is a treasure. I never thought it would feel weightless after being bonded!" Luo Tian laughed heartily.

"Hmm? Bu Jingtian?" Luo Tian checked Qiu Taiping's memories again, looking at the corpse of Bu Yuhan in the distance. He had never imagined that he would meet another residual soul of Bu Jingtian here.

"Would I have killed you if I had known you were such a good person?" Luo Tian's eyes showed a hint of guilt. He never thought that this Qiu Taiping had not only refined the Soul-Subduing Cauldron but also resolved his hidden danger.

"Unfortunately, two masters of soul-fragmentation have died here! I wonder what treasures are in the depths of Windfury Valley!" Luo Tian's eyes carried a hint of greed as he gazed at the depths of Windfury Valley, thinking about the Purple Maple Thunder Tree.

After briefly organizing himself, Luo Tian was overjoyed. This visit to Windfury Valley had truly been worth it. Although he had nearly lost his life, the rewards were more than worth it.

What he cherished most was Qiu Taiping's memories. These were the memories of someone who had lived nearly ten thousand years, containing countless insights and rumors from the Tianyuan Continent.

"I should go plant that Purple Maple Thunder Tree first!" Luo Tian's gaze turned to the location of the Purple Maple Thunder Tree in Windfury Valley, a smile on his face.

However, just as Luo Tian was about to take a step forward, he stopped. His lips slightly curled up, and several figures appeared in his spiritual awareness.

"Luo Tian! Brother!" Cold Qiu Chan's voice came from afar, entering Luo Tian's ears.

Wind blew. Cold Qiu Chan, Zheng Xin, and Long Baobao, along with two young men and women, arrived before Luo Tian. Their eyes carried scrutiny as they looked at Luo Tian.

"Brother..." Long Baobao rushed into Luo Tian's arms like a young bird, his face showing concern.

"Long Baobao, come back!" Cold Qiu Chan and Zheng Xin saw Long Baobao's actions and their faces changed. They shouted loudly.

"Damn you, let go of Long Baobao!" Zheng Xin growled and took out a replica of the Flying Cloud Mace, not thinking twice before smashing it at Luo Tian.

Cold Qiu Chan also drew her sword with a hum, transforming into a black flash. Her blade pointed at Luo Tian.

"Uh..." Luo Tian saw their actions and was slightly stunned, then his lips curled up. He naturally thought that Zheng Bowen had returned to Windfury Valley and told Cold Qiu Chan and Zheng Xin about his possession. Otherwise, they wouldn't have attacked him immediately upon seeing him.

He held Long Baobao in one arm and clenched his fist with the other. His seven-colored fist struck Zheng Xin's Flying Cloud Mace, while he completely ignored Cold Qiu Chan's sword.

Luo Tian could feel that Cold Qiu Chan was still unsure if he had been possessed, so she hadn't attacked with full strength. Luo Tian also took this opportunity to test how strong his physical body truly was.

"Boom..." Like a thunderclap in the night, Luo Tian's fist collided with Zheng Xin's mace, producing a series of loud noises.

At the same time, Cold Qiu Chan's sword had already pierced Luo Tian's arm with a black aura, producing an unpleasant sound. A red dot appeared on Luo Tian's arm, and a drop of blood fell, but it quickly restored to its original state.

Zheng Xin's face was filled with strong disbelief, as if his mace had struck an iron plate. A powerful rebound force made him feel it in his heart, and blood flowed from his mouth, spitting out a large amount. His body flew backward, and the Flying Cloud Mace fell to the ground.

Cold Qiu Chan also showed a glint in her eyes, looking at Luo Tian. Although she hadn't used full strength with her sword, it was still something that a peak bone-fragmentation master couldn't withstand with his body. After all, her sword was a grade-one treasure.

The other two young people who had come with Cold Qiu Chan and Zheng Xin also showed expressions of shock. They naturally knew the strength of Cold Qiu Chan and Zheng Xin, but they hadn't expected that this unassuming young man could simply punch Zheng Xin backward and even withstand Cold Qiu Chan's sword with his body.

"Is this Luo Tian?" A girl, about the same age as Cold Qiu Chan and wearing a pink long dress, spoke softly.

"Probably. This body is terrifying. It's definitely comparable to a yuanling master!" The man seemed to be answering the girl, whispering.

Chapter 423: I Am Luo Tian

Chapter 423: I Am Luo Tian

"Zheng Xin, Qiu Chan, what are you doing? You attack me like this right away!" Luo Tian smiled at Zheng Xin and Cold Qiu Chan.

"You! No matter who you are, get out of Luo Tian's body! Otherwise, even if you run to the ends of the earth, both Windfury Valley and Yuling Sect will find you!" Zheng Xin's face was serious. His Flying Cloud Mace flew back into his hand, and he shouted.

Cold Qiu Chan's brows slightly furrowed. She felt that Luo Tian's expression was somewhat familiar, so she was a bit puzzled. However, after recalling Zheng Bowen's words, she tightened her grip on the sword.

"Brother, help us!"

Zheng Xin knew he and Cold Qiu Chan weren't a match for Luo Tian. The two people who had come with them shouted.

Hearing Zheng Xin's words, the man nodded slightly. His face was serious as he waved his hands, and two Flying Cloud Maces fell into his hands.

However, Luo Tian felt that these maces were much heavier than Zheng Xin's. At least two thousand catties heavier.

"This must be Zheng Xin's older brother, Zheng Tianxiao!" Luo Tian guessed the man's identity in his mind.

"Truly变态 a family!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly. Zheng Hongsheng's three sons, one more变态 than the other.

From Zheng Tianxiao's body, Luo Tian felt a peak bone-fragmentation aura. And it wasn't weak either; it was almost the same as his previous strength before arriving at Windfury Valley. If it had been Luo Tian's earlier self, he wouldn't have had much confidence in defeating this young man.

Zheng Hongsheng's other two sons, Zheng Bowen and Zheng Xin, weren't weak either. They were at the peak of bone-fragmentation or mid-level. In time, they would occupy a place in昆仑 Mountain or the entire Tianyuan Continent. To have three such sons, Zheng Hongsheng was truly worthy of pride.

As for the other girl, Luo Tian couldn't guess her identity at all. This girl gave him a feeling of being lively and had a faint grass-wood energy. Her eyes occasionally showed a hint of pride, though it was well hidden. However, it couldn't escape Luo Tian's eyes.

"Alchemist!" Seeing the girl's pride, Luo Tian guessed her identity. He immediately thought of why Zheng Xin had returned.

"Shan Yuyan!" Luo Tian couldn't help but think of the name Shan Yuyan, his eyes showing a playful expression as he looked at Zheng Xin.

The girl heard Zheng Xin's words and pouted, giving a cold哼. Her eyes showed a brief look of concern before she took out a翠绿色 long ruler weapon.

"Ah? Interesting!" Luo Tian敏锐ly captured the girl's concern and looked at Zheng Xin, who had just been pushed back with a drop of blood from his mouth.

"Okay, I'll take this opportunity to help you. Don't say I'm not helping my brother!" Luo Tian smiled, placing Long Baobao on the ground and winking at him. He sent a mental message to Long Baobao, telling him to stay aside for a while.

"Hmph..." Luo Tian sneered and looked at Zheng Xin and Zheng Tianxiao with a look of disdain.

"Damn you!" Zheng Xin's eyes almost bled. Luo Tian was one of his few friends. Now, he had been possessed, which meant Luo Tian had died.

Previously, in Windfury Valley, after Long Baobao cried for a while, he felt Luo Tian's aura and became excited. They then searched the outer part of Windfury Valley for Luo Tian, only to find Zheng Bowen who had been thrown out.

After Zheng Bowen told them about Luo Tian's situation, Cold Qiu Chan and Zheng Xin were anxious but couldn't leave the injured Zheng Bowen behind. They had to send him back to Windfury Valley's sect before going out to search for Luo Tian.

And just in time, Shan Yuyan had arrived at Windfury Valley. Upon hearing Cold Qiu Chan's explanation, she insisted on coming along. Zheng Tianxiao was worried about the group's safety and naturally let her come with them. However, they hadn't gone far into Windfury Valley before they found Luo Tian's presence.

Thinking of Luo Tian's death, Zheng Xin felt his heart like a knife. At this moment, although Luo Tian's appearance hadn't changed, the seven-element spiritual energy and his previous strength made Zheng Xin certain that this Luo Tian was no longer the one he had known. Only an ancient monster who had lived for countless years could be so powerful.

The more he thought, the more desperate he became. His spiritual energy poured into the Flying Cloud Mace like it was free, his eyes blood-red as he roared: "Wind Over the World!"

A gust of wind came from the Flying Cloud Mace, and a fierce wind-element spiritual energy condensed into a massive mace image. Under the eyes of Cold Qiu Chan and others, it seemed to carry the power of heaven and earth, smashing toward Luo Tian.

Cold Qiu Chan and Zheng Tianxiao were slightly stunned, giving a symbolic attack on Luo Tian.

As for Shan Yuyan, seeing Zheng Xin's wildness, she furrowed her brows slightly. Her wood-element spiritual energy also gathered into the green ruler in her hand, and she shouted: "Horizontal Heaven's Ruler, One Ruler Across Heaven!"

The green long ruler instantly expanded and smashed toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian, seeing the two martial arts techniques above him, narrowed his eyes slightly. His heart was warmed, as Zheng Xin's desperation proved how much he valued this friend.

He took up the Splitting Heaven Spear, lifted its body slightly, and poured his gold-element spiritual energy into it.

"Five Elements' Mutual Generation! Metal Breaks Stone!" He roared, and the Splitting Heaven Spear transformed into a golden dragon. It carried an overwhelming power to split heaven and earth, rushing toward the mace and ruler that had attacked him.

Yes, this was the second move of the Splitting Heaven Spear. Now, Luo Tian could fully perform this second move. With Qiu Taiping's memories, it was no problem for Luo Tian to perform this second move.

A loud explosion echoed. The golden spear instantly tore apart Zheng Xin's mace image and rushed toward the green ruler.

Like two thunderclaps in the daytime, the three martial arts techniques collided, creating a wave of spiritual energy that dissipated into the world.

"This move, Luo Tian has never used before!" Cold Qiu Chan's eyes were cold as she looked at Luo Tian. If it hadn't been for hearing Luo Tian's mental message to symbolically attack, she would have never believed this person was Luo Tian. Her eyes carried deep suspicion and she looked at Luo Tian again.

"Strong!" Zheng Tianxiao's gaze was serious as he looked at Luo Tian. He had also received Luo Tian's mental message, and now seeing Luo Tian neutralize Zheng Xin and Shan Yuyan's martial arts with one technique, he was deeply shocked.

As Zheng Xin's older brother, Zheng Tianxiao naturally knew his younger brother's strength. Zheng Xin and Shan Yuyan's martial arts had already reached the level of a grade-one treasure. Yet, Luo Tian had neutralized them with one technique alone. This left Zheng Tianxiao deeply shaken.

Chapter 424: Zheng Xin Dies

Chapter 424: Zheng Xin Dies

Zheng Xin and Shan Yuyan were also slightly stunned. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to neutralize their martial arts with just one technique.

Then Zheng Xin looked at Zheng Tianxiao and Cold Qiu Chan, puzzled. He had told them to help him attack Luo Tian, but they clearly hadn't used full strength. They hadn't even touched Luo Tian before the collision of the three martial arts techniques annihilated them.

Especially with Cold Qiu Chan, Zheng Xin was confused. Normally, if Luo Tian had died, Cold Qiu Chan would have been even more heartbroken than him. But now, she only carried suspicion in her eyes, which made Zheng Xin angry.

"Cold Qiu Chan! He's not Luo Tian anymore. Are you going to hold back?" Zheng Xin roared at Cold Qiu Chan.

"Be careful!" Before Zheng Xin's words finished, Shan Yuyan's voice entered Zheng Xin's ears. Her lively face showed a worried expression.

"Life-Extinction!" Luo Tian's figure appeared like a ghost before Zheng Xin, his cold voice as icy as ice. His grey fist swept toward Zheng Xin's body.

"Boom..." Zheng Xin flew backward, and during his flight, he aged rapidly. Five hundred years of vitality vanished instantly. At this moment, Luo Tian had completely mastered the essence of wood-element and Life-Extinction Fist was even more terrifying. Especially for a bone-fragmentation master, being hit would lose a lot of vitality.

Luo Tian didn't want to give Zheng Xin any chance. He flew like the wind toward Zheng Xin's body again, and his grey fist landed on Zheng Xin once more.

Two Life-Extinction Fists took away all of Zheng Xin's vitality. His body instantly became withered, and his hair turned completely white.

"Boom..." Zheng Xin's body fell to the ground with a painful expression.

"No..." A piercing scream echoed from behind Luo Tian. A fragrant breeze passed before Luo Tian's body and instantly appeared in front of Zheng Xin.

"Zheng Xin!" Shan Yuyan's face showed pain. She gently lifted the aged Zheng Xin and placed his head on her lap.

Seeing Shan Yuyan, Zheng Xin's eyes were already lifeless but seemed to brighten slightly. He spoke weakly: "Cough... Yuyan, I think the person I regret most in my life is you. I'm sorry. My carelessness ruined your purity!"

"Drop..." Shan Yuyan's tears fell onto the ground. Her wood-element spiritual energy poured into Zheng Xin's body like it was free, and she tapped her storage bag. Various small bottles fell in front of Shan Yuyan.

Shan Yuyan cried while holding Zheng Xin with one hand and pouring wood-element spiritual energy into his body. With the other hand, she continuously moved through the bottles on the ground, searching for medicine to heal Zheng Xin.

"Don't waste it. I know my situation. Don't waste time anymore. I never had the chance to apologize before, but now you can finally listen to me carefully!" It seemed that Shan Yuyan's wood-element spiritual energy had some effect. Zheng Xin's eyes brightened again.

"Don't talk nonsense, I'm an alchemist. You won't die!" Shan Yuyan continuously moved the bottles, shouting at Zheng Xin.

"I'm sorry. I hope after my death, you find a good family to marry. I know for these years because of me, no one dared to propose to your alchemy sect! Now that I'm dead, our engagement is naturally dissolved. You don't have to worry anymore!" Zheng Xin's eyes showed a smile, happy that Shan Yuyan had cared for him at the end.

"I found it!" Shan Yuyan's face showed a surprised expression. A jade bottle fell into her hand, and she took out a pill, her face showing great joy.

The jade-like pill fell into Shan Yuyan's hand, emitting a soft green light. If one didn't look closely, it would seem like a green gemstone.

"Seventh-grade pill!" Luo Tian's heart trembled upon seeing the pill in Shan Yuyan's hand, his face showing strong disbelief.

As an alchemist, Luo Tian naturally knew how difficult it was to refine a seventh-grade pill.

Earlier, he and Lu Kunpeng had refined one of the two-element thunderstorm pills, nearly losing their lives. One could imagine how difficult it was to refine a seventh-grade pill.

Shan Yuyan didn't hesitate and sent the seventh-grade pill into Zheng Xin's mouth. This showed how important Zheng Xin was to her.

But just as the pill was about to reach Zheng Xin's mouth, Luo Tian instantly appeared before Shan Yuyan and took the pill from her hand. A smile on his face: "A seventh-grade pill, giving it to this kid is quite a waste!"

Shan Yuyan was slightly stunned upon seeing her pill taken. Then, she showed a wild expression and stared at Luo Tian with intense eyes.

"Yuyan, don't be reckless. You're not his match! You all run away and deal with the revenge later! Brother, take care of dad! Qiu Chan, you also don't be reckless. You all run away..." Zheng Xin spoke with his last breath, shouting at the three people before closing his eyes and dying.

White hair fluttered in the wind. Shan Yuyan's gaze was stunned, tears sliding down her eyes. She gently placed Zheng Xin's body aside and stood up slightly, her face filled with endless hatred as she looked at Luo Tian.

Seeing Zheng Xin had died, Cold Qiu Chan and Zheng Tianxiao were stunned. Their heads buzzed.

Luo Tian had previously sent them a mental message saying he was Luo Tian himself, making them hesitate. Then, Luo Tian said he could resolve the conflict between Zheng Xin and Shan Yuyan, telling them not to interfere. They had doubted it but believed Luo Tian's words and didn't attack.

But now, Zheng Xin was completely dead. It was impossible to fake this, making them feel deceived and a strong sense of regret.

"Buzz..." As if ignited, Cold Qiu Chan and Zheng Tianxiao's auras rose. Their eyes were filled with blood.

Especially Zheng Tianxiao, who spat out a mouthful of blood. His chest felt like it was on fire.

Zheng Xin was his flesh and blood brother. He had been killed by his own impulse, making him feel guilty beyond words. He wished it was himself who had died.

The Flying Cloud Mace fell into his hand, and he rushed toward Luo Tian.

Cold Qiu Chan did the same. Her sword was in hand, and she had now completely determined that this person wasn't Luo Tian. Luo Tian would never have killed Zheng Xin, so she rushed toward Luo Tian like a black whirlwind.

But just as they had moved, a scorching aura appeared before them: "You all go. I'll take care of him. I won't let Zheng Xin die in vain!"

Chapter 425: Three Thousand Burning Flames

Chapter 425: Three Thousand Burning Flames

Seeing Shan Yuyan blocking them, the gradually scorching aura spread from her body. Cold Qiu Chan and Zheng Tianxiao's faces changed.

"Yuyan, don't be reckless!" Cold Qiu Chan shouted, trying to persuade her.

"Qiu Chan, don't try to stop me. The seal has already been opened. It's too late to prevent it now. You all go, I'm afraid I'll hurt you!" Shan Yuyan's fiery aura grew stronger. Her eyes were increasingly cold.

"Little girl, don't be reckless. If I'm not mistaken, you should hate this person the most, right? I'll kill him and it would fulfill your wish. Why are you still fighting so hard against me?" Luo Tian's face showed a slight tremor, feeling that he had gone too far. The aura from Shan Yuyan made him feel a bit scared.

"Dislike him? Yes, I do. Since I knew my future husband was him, I started to dislike him. But there's nothing I can do about it. This marriage was destined. Two sects wouldn't dare to back out for the sake of face, so I, Shan Yuyan, was destined to marry this person!" Shan Yuyan's face showed a slight smile. She pointed at Zheng Xin, who had died.

"But now you've killed my husband. Although he was annoying, I have to admit that after these years, I've come to see him as my husband. I just didn't realize it myself."

"I came out of the sect secretly this time to try and break off the marriage. But I never expected that he would become like this on the second day I arrived. Seeing him die, I realized what heartache was. Now I've understood many things, but it's too late. He's dead, and the only thing I can do is avenge him! Even if it costs me my life!" Shan Yuyan's face showed a wild expression. Her body was surrounded by a red flame, and an overwhelming aura spread from her.

A scorching aura rose from Shan Yuyan's body. Even the ground beneath her feet smelled of burning.

"Three Thousand Burning Flames! It really is in Yuyan's body! This foolish girl has opened the seal!" Zheng Tianxiao's face changed. His gaze was serious as he looked at Shan Yuyan, who seemed to be wrapped in flames.

"Brother Zheng, go back and find the masters of Windfury Valley to help. If these Three Thousand Burning Flames ignite, they might cause damage to Windfury Valley with the wind!" Cold Qiu Chan also spoke seriously.

"No, you go find people from Windfury Valley. I'll stay here to observe the situation. This place is too dangerous!" Zheng Tianxiao shouted back.

"Your speed is faster than mine. Don't waste time, or it'll be too late!" Cold Qiu Chan saw Zheng Tianxiao hadn't left and was anxious.

Zheng Tianxiao saw Cold Qiu Chan's determination. He thought for a moment and sighed: "Be careful, remember your life is important!"

Zheng Tianxiao said that and his body flashed away toward the direction of Windfury Valley's sect.

"If Zheng Xin could be revived, would you still dislike him?" Luo Tian finally couldn't bear the increasingly scorching aura from Shan Yuyan and asked.

"Buzz..." Hearing Luo Tian's words, the red flames on Shan Yuyan momentarily stopped. Her lively face showed disbelief.

"You're lying to me!" Shan Yuyan thought for a moment and realized Luo Tian was deceiving her. Her anger deepened, and she pointed her finger, sending a red flame dragon toward Luo Tian.

The dragon's path burned half of the void. Even the floating cracks in Windfury Valley were erased by this red flame.

Seeing this, Luo Tian's lips twitched. He activated the Seal-Defying Steps and vanished from his spot, narrowly dodging the red flame.

The red flame hit the ground where Luo Tian had stood but didn't immediately extinguish. Instead, it burned even faster.

"What is this fire!" Luo Tian's heart was serious as he looked at Shan Yuyan approaching him.
