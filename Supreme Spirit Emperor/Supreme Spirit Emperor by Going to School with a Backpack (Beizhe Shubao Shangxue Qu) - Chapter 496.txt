Above the sky, Duan Chengfeng appeared before Luo Tian, his face filled with delight. He had long desired to kill Luo Tian, and now he finally had the chance.

"You shouldn't have killed Xuesha, boy! He was my only son. Killed by your hand—how could I not seek revenge!" Duan Chengfeng's face twisted with ferocity. His green long sword curved into a blade of light, slicing toward Luo Tian.

"Buzz..." The blade's radiance pierced the heavens, instantly appearing before Luo Tian. Though Luo Tian's body was strong, without preparation, if struck by this sword, he would suffer severe injury even if not killed.

"Get out..." Just as the blade was about to strike Luo Tian, two flashes of cold light suddenly pierced Duan Chengfeng's eyes.

"Crash..." The green sword struck Luo Tian, leaving only a white mark before being repelled.

Luo Tian opened his eyes, gazing at the surrounding scene. His face was drenched in cold sweat. Though it seemed brief, Luo Tian felt as if years had passed, trapped in an endless world without escape.

Finally, his mind cleared. He burst forth just as Duan Chengfeng's sword descended upon him.

"Unexpectedly, he emerged from the Mind's Illusion Realm first!" Guan Hongsheng muttered in his heart, eyes filled with disbelief.

When the Mind Demon Elder was at the peak of True Immortal, he was pursued by nine True Immortals from Central Three Heavens and numerous late-stage True Immortals. Yet the Mind Demon Elder used the "Mind's Illusion Realm" from the "Mind Demon Scripture," trapping them and killing three before escaping.

Though Guan Hongsheng was not as powerful as the Mind Demon Elder, Luo Tian was also not at True Immortal peak. In such a short time, he had already escaped the illusion.

"Kill!" Luo Tian ignored others and rushed toward Duan Chengfeng.

"Boom..." Luo Tian's body surged like a flood, slamming the Thunder-Devastating Brush onto Duan Chengfeng's body.

Luo Tian had now reached the Late Heaven-Immortal Stage. When he was at the Middle Heaven-Immortal Stage, he had nearly defeated Duan Chengfeng. Now, before Luo Tian's Late Heaven-Immortal Stage, Duan Chengfeng was destined to be crushed.

"Boom..." Blood mist erupted. Duan Chengfeng was smashed into a blood mist, falling from the sky.

Blood stained the Thunder-Devastating Brush. Luo Tian stood there, gazing at Guan Hongsheng. At this moment, Guan Hongsheng's aura was nearly approaching True Immortality.

"Boom..." A deep rumble echoed in the sky. Dark clouds drifted over, enveloping the Chaos Heaven Mountain, causing Luo Tian's face to change drastically.

"This... is a True Immortal's heavenly tribulation!" Luo Tian's expression shifted abruptly, sensing an irresistible aura.

"He must not reach True Immortal. With so much cultivation left to absorb, if he fully absorbs it, he might reach the Early or Late True Immortal Stage. Then these people would be unable to stop him!" Luo Tian muttered, watching the ongoing battle.

At this moment, not only were the people of Chaos Heaven Mountain entangled in chaos and attacking each other, but even Ye Liangchen and others were caught in the confusion.

Meanwhile, Xuan Dan and several other True Immortals stood there, mirroring Luo Tian's previous state—like statues.

"Demon Eyes..." Soon after, Luo Tian saw those countless Demon Eyes. All were pure and refined cultivation energy, but Luo Tian dared not absorb them, fearing unexpected consequences.

"Luo Tian!" As Luo Tian pondered, Xuan Dan opened his eyes. The green divine light in Xuan Dan's eyes gradually faded, returning to normal.

"Senior Brother, he is about to reach the Early True Immortal Stage. We must find a way to stop him!" Luo Tian's brows furrowed slightly.

"I'll try!" Xuan Dan spoke, taking a step forward and rushing toward Guan Hongsheng. Meanwhile, Fan Tianyu and Mei Gueqi rushed out to confront Xuan Dan.

"Kill!" Luo Tian roared, his hands moving. Black ghost seals and beast seals hovered above his head. At the same time, the Ghost King emerged. Upon the Ghost King's appearance, his body trembled slightly.

"Chirp... chirp..."

"Damn, this is a good thing!" The sound of sparrows and absurd voices echoed into Luo Tian's mind.

"All mine... all mine..." The messy sparrow flew out from the Beast Summoning Seal. Its black eyes gazed at those Demon Eyes.

"Come here, you bastard! Stop!" The messy sparrow shouted, sending out an invisible wave from its mouth.

A powerful wave instantly enveloped the entire Chaos Heaven Mountain. Those swept by the wave suddenly awoke, their eyes filled with confusion as they gazed at each other.

"Crack..." The ghostly face of the Illusion Staff changed expressions under this wave, finally shattering with a crash.

"Buzz..." A strong suction rose. Those returned to their original forms, the Demon Seeds converged toward the sparrow. Even the one Guan Hongsheng had just swallowed was forcibly pulled out.

"Ah..." Fan Tianyu and Mei Gueqi cried out in agony, watching their actions turn into Demon Seeds that converged toward the sparrow.

"Crack..." Black Demon Seeds snapped Guan Hongsheng's two teeth. Under his disbelief, they flew toward the sparrow.

"Damn it, kid! Next time something like this happens, just call me out directly. Who dares to compete with me? I'll eliminate them for you!" The sparrow shouted loudly, its voice filled with arrogance. Then, the black Demon Seeds blocked the sparrow's mouth.

"Rustle... rustle..." The Demon Seeds collided continuously, forming a vortex. Then twisting and turning, they were swallowed by the sparrow.

"What's going on?" As the Mind's Illusion Realm was shattered, people returned to normal. They all widened their eyes at the sight of the sparrow devouring the black Demon Seeds.

"Who is this old man?" Ye Liangchen was stunned. He knew the sparrow was strong, but he never imagined it could be this powerful—those were Demon Seeds of cultivation energy. Only those who had practiced Dao-Heart Seeding Demon could devour them.

"How did he do it?" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with light. This sparrow was terrifying. Watching the Demon Seeds enter its body, it looked comically absurd.

The sparrow was only palm-sized. The smallest Demon Seeds were palm-sized, yet they were devoured by the sparrow, leaving people doubtful. What could it possibly use to contain them?

"Can't let this pass. I need to grab some too. Maybe it will be useful in the future!" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, then moved swiftly toward the black vortex.

"Old sparrow, give me some. You won't refuse, will you?" Luo Tian smiled awkwardly, addressing the sparrow before starting to grab.

"Kid, only a hundred Early Heaven-Immortal Stage Demon Seeds. That's enough for you to reach the Late Heaven-Immortal Stage. If you take more, I'll kill you!" The sparrow's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind, causing him to display a joyous expression.

Chapter 1915: Taking the Long Way()

Long Yin City, Luo Tian's second foothold since entering the Immortal Realm. Long Youran's father, Long Li, had now become the absolute master of five surrounding cities. Thanks to his daughter's status, Long Youran, an inner disciple of the Tianmen Sect, had become the greatest support for Long Yin City.

Luo Tian's name spread throughout the five cities, making Long Li untouchable. Even major cities with powerful sects nearby knew not to provoke the five cities.

With the destruction of the Thunder-Devastating Sect, Long Li's position became unshakable. Everyone knew that before, the Thunder-Devastating Sect had sent people to kill nearly a thousand of the Long family. But when Luo Tian and Long Youran returned, they had destroyed the sect's elders. The Thunder-Devastating Sect was also mysteriously annihilated.

However, these days, Long Li had some troubles. The source of his worries was the Endless Forest. Half a month ago, strange changes had occurred in the Endless Forest. The howls of wolves echoed constantly. Black clouds enveloped the entire forest, making it even more terrifying than before, with black mist surrounding it day and night.

When heavenly phenomena appeared, it was either the emergence of a precious treasure or something strange. However, these did not affect the five cities.

But seven days ago, the dominant beast of the Endless Forest, the Moon-Howling Wolf, had begun to emerge constantly from the forest. It actively attacked people outside the Endless Forest and was gradually advancing toward the five cities.

How could Long Li not be worried? He had sent people to investigate the Endless Forest, but they never returned.

Moreover, these days, the Moon-Howling Wolves had become more frenzied, as if organized. They gathered outside the Endless Forest and launched attacks.

The five cities united to withstand waves of Moon-Howling Wolf assaults. The five cities suffered heavy casualties.

"City Lord Long, we might as well retreat if it's unavoidable. Although our foundation is in the five cities, if another wave comes, we won't be able to withstand it!" Sun Luoshan, with his bald head and anxious face, spoke to Long Li.

"Wait a little longer. We've already contacted the sects. With such events in the Endless Forest, they will certainly be interested and might send disciples or elders!"

"Three days. If the sects don't come within three days, we'll evacuate the five cities!" Long Li spoke solemnly, his voice carrying reluctance.

"City Lord of Long Yin City has arrived!" As Long Li and others discussed, waves of energy echoed outside Long Yin City, causing their bodies to tremble slightly.

"They've come!" The group's faces lit up with joy. They quickly stepped out of the city lord's mansion.

Outside the city lord's mansion, several figures stood there. Their faces bore arrogance, like straight pillars, standing motionless. They gazed at Long Li as he hurriedly exited the mansion.

"Those are the people from the Unmoving Sect!" Sun Luoshan stood behind Long Li, speaking to him. Sun Luoshan had once been connected with sects, though distantly. He could recognize these people's origins.

"Greetings to the senior elders of the Unmoving Sect!" Long Li slightly bowed, addressing the figures with respect.

"Rude! A mere city lord dares to greet us only with a slight bow. Don't you know to bow deeply?" A youth with arrogance on his face looked at Long Li and spoke loudly.

"Forgive my rudeness!" Long Li's expression slightly changed. He had not expected the Unmoving Sect to be so arrogant.

The Unmoving Sect's strength was known to Long Li. Compared to the Thunder-Devastating Sect, it was much stronger. However, compared to sects like the Tianmen Sect or Chaos Heaven Sect, it was at least two levels lower.

"Hmph. You know well enough. Give us the city lord's mansion to stay here for several days!" The youth coldly sneered, commanding Long Li.

"Sir, is this not excessive? Our city lord's mansion is large enough for the three of you to stay. Moreover, other sects will come. We'll need to arrange for them!" Long Li spoke softly, slightly bowing but maintaining his dignity.

"What? A mere city lord dares to speak like this to us. I'll tell you what to do. Take your people and leave the city lord's mansion! I'll count to ten. If you don't leave, don't blame me for helping you out!" The youth shouted loudly.

"Since when has the Unmoving Sect become so arrogant?" However, as soon as the youth's words finished, a cold aura came from afar. Several streaks of light flashed and appeared in people's sight.

The leader was a woman with a cold face, her long sword strapped on her back. Behind her were several disciples in green robes, their faces equally cold. The sleeves of their green robes bore a soaring green dragon, indicating their identity.

"The Tianmen Sect!"

"Greetings to the Tianmen Sect's senior disciples!" The disciples of the Unmoving Sect immediately changed expressions, acting like lapdogs. They approached the group with reverence.

"Did you tell him to leave?" The woman's eyes looked at the youth who had spoken earlier. Her cold gaze made him unable to meet her eyes.

"Yes, we wanted them to vacate the city lord's mansion so that you could use it!" The youth lowered his head, speaking with flattery. Compared to before, he was a different person.

"Cut off one arm, this matter is settled!" The woman coldly spoke. Her voice carried no fluctuation.

"Dad! I miss you so much!" As she spoke, the woman's face changed. She rushed into Long Li's arms.

"Haha, daughter, I miss you too!" Long Li laughed heartily, patting Long Youran's head affectionately.

"Dad..." The youth was stunned. The people from the Unmoving Sect were also stunned. They never expected Long Li to have such a powerful background.

"Where is Luo Tian?" Long Li softly asked, carefully examining Long Youran. His face showed satisfaction.

"Luo Tian went to the Central Three Heavens. He's been gone for a long time and hasn't returned yet!" Long Youran looked worried as she replied.

"Luo... Luo Tian... the one who destroyed the Thunder-Devastating Sect..." The youth trembled. Who didn't know the Tianmen Sect's first senior disciple? When the Thunder-Devastating Sect was destroyed, although people didn't know it was Luo Tian at first, later they couldn't escape the eyes of others. After all, someone had recognized the dog-riding youth as Luo Tian.

"Look at what? Speak! You heard us. Our senior sister is being merciful. Wait for us to help you?" The disciples accompanying Long Youran smiled coldly, looking at the trembling youth.

"Yes... yes... I'll cut now..." The youth gritted his teeth, his heart aching. He never expected that the background of such a small city lord was so big.

"Go far away and cut, don't dirty my house!" Long Youran sneered, then pulled Long Li's hand into the city lord's mansion.

"Dad, what's happening with the Endless Forest?" Long Youran asked with confusion. She had seen the changes in the Endless Forest when she returned.

Long Li sighed, then recounted the recent situation to Long Youran. Her face and that of her disciples turned serious.

"Dad, we must evacuate. The changes in the Moon-Howling Wolves indicate something big has happened in the Endless Forest. Luo Tian could control the Moon-Howling Wolves before. It's best to wait for him to return from the Central Three Heavens." Long Youran spoke softly.

"Yes, if you say to evacuate, then we'll evacuate. However, I still need to enter the Endless Forest once. Your uncle Zheng hasn't returned since he entered the forest recently. I want to check on him!" Long Li's eyes were resolute.

"Father, leave it to me. You've already notified other sects, right? Let's wait for more people from the sects to arrive before entering together!" Long Youran sighed deeply. Thinking of how she and Luo Tian had seen so many Moon-Howling Wolves in the Endless Forest, her scalp tingled.

...

Chaos Heaven Sect was swept by terrifying lightning for three days before finally stopping. The entire Chaos Heaven Sect turned to ashes, with the surrounding hundred miles annihilated by lightning.

"Ahh..."

"Luo Tian..." A figure, charred black and lying there, uttered a weak voice. Yet his voice carried overwhelming hatred.

"Luo Tian... I want you to die... but also thank you... without you, I wouldn't have passed this ultimate stage of True Immortal. I've become a Pure Yang True Immortal!"

"Unexpectedly, this golden scripture is so powerful!" The charred body growled. Then slowly stood up.

"Once my injuries heal, I will definitely kill the Tianmen Sect!" The charred figure vanished into the sky, leaving a ruin.

At this moment, Luo Tian and Ye Liangchen stood outside the Endless Forest. Crossing through it would lead them to Long Yin City.

"What's happening with the Endless Forest?" Luo Tian and others looked solemn, gazing at the thick black clouds enveloping it. The howls echoed within the forest, sounding terrifying.

"Hey, Tiange, maybe we should call for more people. I feel this forest might swallow us!" Ye Liangchen grimaced, his body trembling.

"Something must have happened. I saw Huangquan and Bianhuan flowers deep in the Endless Forest before!" Luo Tian looked at the thick black mist. He knew it was ghost energy.

Luo Tian felt a sudden shock, sensing the Endless Forest might have experienced a terrible change. He spoke solemnly.

The most worrying thing for Luo Tian was Guan Hongsheng. It had been three days since they left Chaos Heaven Mountain, but the Epoch Book hadn't returned. Luo Tian had tried to contact it using a page in his mind, but it remained restrained.

"Let's take the long way. Head to Long Yin City first. I know a friend there, maybe he can tell us some news." Luo Tian spoke to the others.

Chapter 1916: Waiting for You()

Hearing Luo Tian's words, the brows of Ye Liangchen and others' accompanying True Immortals slightly furrowed. If they took the long way, it would waste a lot of time.

"Kid, you don't want to go in, do you? We helped you take revenge. Now you're turning your back on us?" A True Immortal elder spoke, his gaze unkind toward Luo Tian.

"Senior, your words are mistaken. I'm not a coward. However, we need to understand the situation in the Endless Forest. If something happened inside, we can prepare early!" Luo Tian replied.

Luo Tian secretly laughed. When he attacked Chaos Heaven Sect, they watched from the sidelines. Only when Guan Hongsheng used Dao-Heart Seeding Demon did they realize their greed and decided to act. If it weren't for the sparrow's final move, they would have suffered heavy losses too.

But thinking was one thing; he wouldn't say it out loud. Choosing to take the long way, Luo Tian didn't want to get involved in the Endless Forest's mess. He wanted to find an opportunity on the way to return Star River Sect to Ye Liangchen. After all, there was no need for him to risk his life unnecessarily.

"You're right, Tiange. Let's take the long way and check the situation first!" Ye Liangchen nodded quickly, as he also didn't want to enter the Endless Forest. His instinct told him this forest was no simple matter, with great danger. If they entered, they might lose Star River Sect and even their lives.

"Let's go. Taking the long way, it'll only take two days with our speed!" Luo Tian spoke softly.

"Senior Brother, after we reach Long Yin City, you should return to the Tianmen Sect first. If the Tianmen Sect sends people, that would be best!" Luo Tian spoke to Xuan Dan. He didn't want Xuan Dan to risk his life as well. Xuan Dan had already done enough for him.

They took flight, circling around the Endless Forest toward Long Yin City.

Meanwhile, Long Yin City was bustling these days. Many sect disciples arrived at Long Yin City, gathering outside it.

"Senior Sister Youran, the Flying Horse Sect follows your instructions!"

"The Water Cloud Sect also follows your instructions!" Disciples of various sects looked at Long Youran with intense eyes, shouting loudly. No one expected the Endless Forest to have drawn the Tianmen Sect's disciples.

Tianmen Sect disciples were another identity in the eyes of these sects. If they could establish connections, their sect would definitely reward them.

"Thank you all. If there's any treasure in the Endless Forest, everyone will benefit. The Tianmen Sect won't compete with you!"

"True Immortals, follow me to fly into the Endless Forest!" Long Youran spoke loudly. Then she took flight, rising hundreds of feet high and leading everyone into the Endless Forest.

"Buzz..." As Long Youran's words ended, figures took flight and followed her into the Endless Forest. They flew over the fierce Moon-Howling Wolves, entering it.

Two days after Long Youran and others entered the Endless Forest, Luo Tian and his group finally circumvented it to reach Long Yin City.

As they entered the city, they felt a heavy atmosphere. Luo Tian and others furrowed their brows slightly.

"Senior Brother, you should return to the Tianmen Sect first. I'll find Star River Sect for Ye Xiong and then return!" Luo Tian spoke to Xuan Dan, indicating he should leave.

"Be careful!" Xuan Dan looked at the more intense black clouds in the Endless Forest, his eyes filled with concern. He gave a final warning before taking flight.

Watching Xuan Dan leave, Luo Tian sighed deeply and stepped into Long Yin City with Ye Liangchen and others.

However, the city appeared empty. People hurried about, even Luo Tian saw some people preparing to leave Long Yin City.

"Did other sects arrive?" Luo Tian muttered, then stepped toward the city lord's mansion.

"Senior Long!" Luo Tian shouted towards the city lord's mansion, as no one was guarding it now.

"Senior Brother Luo Tian!" Hearing Luo Tian's shout, a figure rushed out from the city lord's mansion. It was Xiao Liu, who had once been found by Luo Tian and Long Youran among the corpses in the city lord's mansion.

"Xiao Liu, what's going on?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly, looking at the empty city lord's mansion.

"The Endless Forest erupted in a beast tide, attacking the five cities. The city lord led people to resist it!" Xiao Liu spoke, his voice filled with urgency.

"I'll check!" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed. He took flight toward the border between the Endless Forest and the five cities.

At the border of the five cities and the Endless Forest, Long Li, Sun Luoshan, Zhang Fengfeng were covered in blood. They watched the endless beasts constantly attacking. Each Moon-Howling Wolf was slain by Long Li's group.

Behind them, the elite forces of the five cities looked exhausted, following their lead and continuously slaying Moon-Howling Wolves.

As dusk approached, howls echoed within the wolf packs. The endless Moon-Howling Wolves seemed to have heard a command, becoming even more frenzied. Behind them, several fierce beasts radiated powerful energy, pushing through the Moon-Howling Wolf packs toward Long Li's group.

The fierce beasts knew that if they killed these defiant opponents, they could break through.

"Are these fierce beasts mad? They don't fear death at all!" Sun Luoshan shouted, raising a golden mountain that crashed onto dozens of Moon-Howling Wolves.

"City Lord, we should retreat. We can't withstand this. If those early-stage True Immortal fierce beasts attack, we're done! Plus, with the City Lord, we are only four True Immortals!" Zhang Fengfeng also shouted.

"Notify the city's people to evacuate quickly. We must hold until the five cities' people retreat!" Long Li's face was grim. On the second day after Long Youran and others entered the Endless Forest, a beast tide had erupted. This time it was even more furious, as if determined not to stop.

The killing continued. The elite forces of the five cities kept losing members, although the Moon-Howling Wolves suffered even greater losses. However, with their overwhelming numbers, they almost surrounded the five cities.

"Roar..." The most shocking thing for Long Li's group was that over a dozen early-stage True Immortal fierce beasts emerged from the Moon-Howling Wolf pack, now within a thousand feet.

Facing the Moon-Howling Wolves of the Daoist Stage, if they took flight, those wolves would be powerless against them. But True Immortals were different.

Time passed slowly. Finally, a few early-stage True Immortal fierce beasts broke through the Moon-Howling Wolf pack and appeared before Long Li's group.

"Roar..." A black bear the size of a mountain roared, raising its paw to strike Long Li.

"Repel it!" Long Li shouted. A golden dragon flew from his body, and he struck with a palm, colliding with the bear's paw.

"Boom..." The collision echoed. An invisible wave spread outward, affecting dozens of Moon-Howling Wolves surrounding Long Li and turning them into corpses on the ground.

"Cough... cough..." Long Li spat blood, his legs sinking into the ground. Terrifying cracks spread down his arms.

Sun Luoshan and Zhang Fengfeng fought against several other early-stage True Immortal fierce beasts. They weren't afraid, but their foundation was in the five cities. Their family and friends were all there. They couldn't retreat; if they did, those behind them would be doomed and unable to withstand the beast tide's attack.

"Kill!" The elite forces of the five cities shouted, naturally knowing who was behind them.

However, Long Li's group could only hold for a while before beginning to falter. Each person had to face two early-stage True Immortal fierce beasts, and enduring this was already a miracle.

"Boom..." Long Li collided with the black bear again. His chest was torn open by a True Immortal mountain cat-like beast, revealing his ribs. He fell heavily into the ground.

"Done..." Long Li's eyes showed bitterness, and his body crashed into the earth.

"Roar..." The black bear seemed victorious, beating its chest. Its massive paw struck Long Li again.

"Beast! You dare to die!" Just as the black bear's paw was about to strike Long Li, a terrifying pressure suddenly descended upon the battlefield, causing it to freeze instantly.

"Buzz..." Six golden lights rose from the city walls. Golden arrows pierced through darkness, flying toward six early-stage True Immortal fierce beasts.

"Boom... boom... boom..." Explosions echoed. The six early-stage True Immortal fierce beasts exploded, and the wild energy annihilated many Moon-Howling Wolves.

"Roar..." The golden wings flapped slowly. The Moon-Howling Wolf King roared, and Luo Tian took flight.

"Wail..." The frenzied Moon-Howling Wolves howled, their bodies rising with black mist. Their dark eyes turned green.

Luo Tian stood on the Moon-Howling Wolf King, holding the Sun-Devouring Bow. His gaze turned solemn as he looked toward the Endless Forest.

"Who is it!" As the Moon-Howling Wolves stopped attacking, a group of elite forces from the five cities fell to the blood-stained ground, panting heavily. This was their first time experiencing such a brutal battle.

"It's Luo Tian!" Someone spoke, as it hadn't been long since Luo Tian had saved Long Li and others in Long Yin City.

"Luo Tian!" Seeing the magnificent Luo Tian standing on the Moon-Howling Wolf King, people immediately showed respect.

"Haha, don't be afraid. I've come to save you!" As people were excited, Ye Liangchen's unorthodox voice echoed, bringing them back to their senses.

"I've been waiting for you a long time!" A fervent voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

Chapter 1917: The Maze()

"Who is it?" Luo Tian's heart tightened. He couldn't recall meeting anyone with such a voice.

"Senior Brother, no one is here!" Ye Liangchen and others heard Luo Tian's shout. Their faces showed confusion; they hadn't heard anyone speaking.

"Come on... find me, and you'll know who I am!" A cold voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"Luo Tian!" Long Li's face was filled with joy, his eyes showing relief. He never expected Luo Tian to appear.

"Who are those people behind Senior Luo? They're all so strong. Are they the Tianmen Sect's geniuses and elders?" People whispered, as Luo Tian and twenty others stood there. Though they didn't release their aura, the invisible pressure made people bow their heads.

"Uncle, what's going on?" Luo Tian suppressed his doubts and looked at Long Li. He waved a hand, sending a pill into Long Li's mouth.

"This is a long story..." After taking the pill, Long Li's face improved. He recounted the entire incident to Luo Tian.

"Is it Youran in the Endless Forest?" Luo Tian's face darkened. He had intended to leave, but since Youran was in the Endless Forest, he couldn't ignore it.

"Yes, I'm sorry for Youran!" Long Li's face showed regret. He had realized the danger in the Endless Forest exceeded his expectations, and it was beyond what Youran's group of early-stage True Immortals could handle.

"Uncle, take the five cities' people out first. I'll go in and check!" Luo Tian's face was solemn as he spoke to Long Li. At this moment, Long Li and others were of no use.

"Senior Luo, don't go in. It's too dangerous. Without a True Immortal elder, you can't go deep!" Long Li shook his head. Though he wanted to save Youran, he didn't want Luo Tian to take the risk.

"Uncle, don't worry. We have several True Immortal elders with us. I'm now at the Late Heaven-Immortal Stage. Originally, I planned to enter the Endless Forest!" Luo Tian replied. His words made everyone's faces change.

"True Immortal! My god, several True Immortals. Are they those old men? My god, I remember the Tianmen Sect has only eight True Immortals. Luo Tian brought six!" Everyone's hearts were filled with shock.

"True Immortal!"

"Luo Tian... you..." Long Li's face also showed disbelief. Sun Luoshan and Zhang Fengfeng were filled with awe.

"Yes, I'm Ye Liangchen. The rest of the matters are left to us. It's just a single Endless Forest, and we'll push through it!" Ye Liangchen, seeing the respectful looks around him, was very pleased. He spoke loudly.

"Ye Liangchen? Who is Ye Liangchen? I've never heard of him..." However, people's reactions soon made Ye Liangchen's face awkward.

"I guess I need to know my identity!"

"Here we go again... this kid is even more arrogant than I am..." Diaodezhu lay on Luo Tian's shoulder, sighing deeply.

"I'm the one who is loved by everyone, admired by flowers, and moves heaven and earth. I am Ye Liangchen, the renowned name in the Central Three Heavens!"

"q11"

"My father is Ye Wudao, the head of Star River Sect. My uncle is Ye Tian, the leader of Star River Sect's Iron Blood Hall. My grandfather..." Ye Liangchen spoke loudly, his voice echoing through the air, causing everyone's faces to finally change.

"Central Three Heavens!"

"Star River Sect!" Though people didn't know who Ye Liangchen was, they knew Central Three Heavens. They knew that sects in the Central Three Heavens were all much stronger than the Tianmen Sect.

"My god, what did Luo Tian do to get so many people from Central Three Heavens to know him!" People looked at Luo Tian with admiration.

"Uncle, evacuate. Leave the rest to me!" Luo Tian spoke to Long Li, calming his mind.

"Good, Senior Luo. Take care. If possible, prioritize your own safety!" Long Li thought for a moment before looking at Luo Tian.

"Rest assured, I'll bring Youran out!" Luo Tian spoke to Long Li, indicating he could leave.

"Blood... not enough!" Just as Long Li prepared to organize people to leave, a cold voice echoed in their ears.

"Buzz..." The black mist from the Moon-Howling Wolf gradually gathered together, instantly forming a thousand-foot ghost face. It opened its mouth to swallow the Moon-Howling Wolves and people from the five cities.

"Roar..." In an instant, the Moon-Howling Wolves and people from the five cities were devoured by the black ghost face. A crunching sound echoed from its mouth, and blood formed a long red river flowing on the ground.

"Run quickly!" Luo Tian's eyes darkened. He shouted at Long Li and others, then waved his hands. The Golden Intercepting Seal flew from his hand toward the black ghost face.

"Boom..." The golden intercepting seal pressed onto the black ghost face, causing it to twist slightly before shattering.

"Buzz..." However, the black mist reformed again, shaping into a ghost face that lunged at the Moon-Howling Wolves. Again, many of them were devoured by the black mouth.

"Roar..." The Moon-Howling Wolf King's eyes turned red. Seeing its kin dying in large numbers, it spat out a golden sun that crashed onto the ghost face, shattering it again. However, it only lasted for a moment before reforming.

"Everyone, attack together! Let's try to destroy this ghost face completely!" Luo Tian spoke to Ye Liangchen and others, unleashing the God King's Nine Heavens Map.

"Good!" Ye Liangchen nodded. Suddenly, a golden finger shot out from his hand.

"Buzz..." Six True Immortals attacked. Their True Immortal power erupted, and a series of martial arts techniques with overwhelming might pushed through the heavens toward the ghost face.

Destroy... reform... destroy... it cycled endlessly. The ghost face, under the attacks of martial arts techniques, continuously turned into black mist and reformed.

"I don't believe I can't break your technique!" Luo Tian glared at the black mist that had been shattered again. He coldly sneered, and a series of seven-color fire dragons burst from his hands.

"Eight Directions Fire!" Luo Tian extended his hand, and seven-color flames instantly ignited in the sky. The seven-color fire sea spread across the heavens, forming a seven-color flame prison that trapped the surging black mist.
