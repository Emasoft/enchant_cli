“Nascent Soul Mid-Stage?” Luo Tian's lips curled slightly, sensing the interrogation and disdain in their voices. A flicker of irritation stirred within him.

“What if it is? Do you dare touch me?” Luo Tian retorted loudly, his gaze cold. He had not forgotten how they had chased him like a dog years ago.

In Beichang County, the three of them were as untouchable as the sky. Their words were law. Seeing Luo Tian utterly disregarding them, Han Family and Zhao Family's elders' gazes turned cold.

“Touch you? Do you know who you're speaking to?” The Han Family elder's aura surged, a hint of killing intent flickering on his face.

“He is the Young Master of Tianshi Sect. Are you sure you want to fight me first?” Luo Tian pointed towards Yang Huanyu, who stood arms crossed, watching the scene.

“Tianshi Sect?” Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, the two elders' expressions shifted slightly, their gazes turning toward Yang Huanyu.

Yang Huanyu felt Luo Tian's attention shift to him. His body trembled slightly, his gaze deep and calm as he looked at the three Nascent Soul Mid-Stage elders. The atmosphere above the sky grew subtly tense.

Chapter 455: Chaos in Beichang County

Chapter 455: Chaos in Beichang County

Five Nascent Soul Realm masters radiated powerful fluctuations, making the disciples of several sects and the remaining over a hundred people under Wu Tian dare not move. They felt as if any movement would trigger an explosive war, on the brink of eruption.

Huang Tianrui and his son Huang Boding looked up at Luo Tian standing proudly in the sky, their faces filled with admiration. In just over a year, Luo Tian had grown to rival their elders. Though his cultivation was slightly behind, the overwhelming aura and extraordinary physical attributes had narrowed the gap significantly.

“Even if he is from Tianshi Sect, in Beichang County, no sect dares to lord over us three!” The Han Family elder mused quietly.

“Yet, do you think we care about Tianshi Sect? Would you kill them just for that? You're dreaming, kid. Remember, this is Beichang County. No matter which sect you belong to, don't view it with worldly eyes!” The Zhao Family elder sneered.

To outsiders, Tianshi Sect was a scourge deserving of death. But to those long established in Beichang County, profit outweighed everything.

“Hand over the rank-level martial techniques, or we may have to eliminate this prodigy today!” The Zhao Family elder spoke before Luo Tian could respond, his mind already filled with killing intent.

The three elders had certainly heard of Luo Tian. After the auction in Beiming City, his presence had stirred considerable commotion. They knew of his cultivation and the grudge formed during that auction.

Over a year had passed, and this once easily eliminated boy had grown into one they now feared. That was reason enough to stir their killing intent.

“Take the Tianshi Sect kid, I'll deal with Luo Tian!” The Huang Family elder, who had remained silent, smiled and addressed the other two.

“Huh?” The Han and Zhao elders looked puzzled. The Huang Family had maintained a neutral stance during the campaign against Wu Tian, even refraining from participating in previous battles. Now their elder's attitude left the two confused.

Luo Tian was also taken aback by the Huang Family elder’s words, recalling their previous treatment of him. When he fled, Huang Tianrui's attack had seemed fierce but had done nothing to harm him. That had earned Luo Tian some goodwill toward the Huang Family.

But the Huang Family elder gave no time for reaction. A dark spear materialized in his hand, a faint smile on his face as he flashed toward Luo Tian like lightning.

“What's with this old man?” The Han and Zhao elders frowned, sensing the Huang Family elder’s formidable attack.

While they pondered, their movements sealed Yang Huanyu's escape routes but did not strike immediately, instead locking onto him.

“Interesting!” Yang Huanyu's lips curled slightly. Unfazed by the two Nascent Soul Mid-Stage masters' formidable energy, he regarded Luo Tian and the Huang Family elder's battle with interest.

“Using a spear?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, sensing an odd familiarity in the Huang Family elder’s weapon.

“I’ll see what you’re hiding!” Luo Tian snorted, his crackling spear materializing instantly. His face bore a battle-ready expression as he faced the Nascent Soul Mid-Stage master without fear. Golden spear energy surged, striking toward the Huang Family elder.

At the moment Luo Tian's crackling spear appeared, the Huang Family elder’s murky eyes suddenly glowed with sharp light, a barely perceptible joy on his face.

“Father, what’s going on? It wasn’t said that Luo Tian…”

“Silence! The elder knows what he’s doing!” Huang Tianrui cut off his son, his face also puzzled.

As no one understood the situation, Luo Tian and the Huang Family elder clashed violently.

Golden light flared. The sky seemed to split with a golden lightning bolt, the overwhelming golden elemental energy dispersing from their collision. Their spear tips met, sending invisible ripples behind them.

“Wu Tian’s scum! Today you all die!” The Han Family's Han Lihui and Zhao Hongyi’s faces bore wild expressions. Their family's direct forces had arrived, giving them confidence. They thought all this was due to Wu Tian’s faction and felt resentment.

“Hmph… do you think you’re worthy?” Leng Qiuchan and Zheng Xin stood before Wu Tian’s members, their gazes cold toward the three families’ disciples.

Long Bao Bei stood in front of them, his eyes darting. Having been with Luo Tian for so long, he had grown accustomed to bloody scenes and no longer feared them as before.

“What are you doing!” Long Bao Bei’s voice had changed, no longer a childish tone but that of an eight-year-old.

“Little brat! Go home and nurse, hah!”

“Who’s kid? Why are you here? What are your parents doing? Relying on a child to save yourself?” A Han Family disciple mocked Long Bao Bei, laughing loudly.

“Who are you talking to!” Long Bao Bei’s face scrunched up, his large eyes quickly spotting the speakers and stepping forward.

“Talking to you! Go back before I spank your bottom!” Seeing Long Bao Bei’s adorable face, people teased him, causing laughter.

“Spank my bottom? I hate it when others spank me. My parents always do!” Long Bao Bei began, but suddenly remembered he had grown up and was no longer a child. He closed his mouth.

“Haha…” Long Bao Bei’s words caused more laughter.

“I’m angry! You’re all doomed, especially you, and you, and you!” Long Bao Bei crossed his arms, pointing at the names of those who had mocked him.

This action made Han Lihui and Zhao Hongyi’s faces slightly tense. They struggled to identify the speakers among the crowd, but this boy could pinpoint them accurately—something strange.

As they pondered, a sudden tremor shook their senses. A terrifying fluctuation rose from the source.

Chapter 456: Little Ancestor

Chapter 456: Little Ancestor

“Buzz…”

A powerful aura radiated from Long Bao Bei, drawing everyone’s attention. Even Yang Huanyu and the other two elders in the sky were drawn to this fluctuation.

At that moment, Long Bao Bei’s face was youthful. He opened his mouth as if drawing in air, his belly swelling.

A spiritual energy vortex formed above the sky from this simple inhalation. As Long Bao Bei inhaled, the spiritual energy within a hundred miles seemed to be drained, even weakening the attacks between Luo Tian and the Huang Family elder.

“Is this a little monster?”

“Fall back! Hurry!” Han Lihui and Zhao Hongyi felt a sudden realization, shouting at their disciples.

But Long Bao Bei gave them no chance to retreat. He opened his mouth, exhaling a dragon’s breath.

“Ah…” With a childish roar, a scorching dragon's breath erupted from Long Bao Bei’s mouth like a volcanic eruption.

A thousand-zhang-long, hundred-zhang-wide fire dragon roared forward, devouring Han and Zhao families’ disciples.

“Damn!” The Han and Zhao elders above the sky looked furious, watching their disciples consumed by the terrifying fire dragon. They hadn’t expected a child to possess such power, cursing their own negligence while looking at Long Bao Bei with fear.

Not only them, but everyone stared in terror at Long Bao Bei. They couldn’t fathom how a child could have such combat power, eradicating so many people with just a breath.

Even Leng Qiuchan and Zheng Xin looked astonished. Though they knew Long Bao Bei was formidable, they hadn’t expected him to reach such a level. Even the two Nascent Soul Mid-Stage elders looked fearful.

“Hmph! Now you know my strength!” Long Bao Bei patted his belly, exhaling a wisp of smoke. His face bore disdain as he looked at the disciples of Han and Zhao families consumed by his breath.

Huang Tianrui wiped sweat from his forehead, secretly thanking their elder’s wisdom for separating Huang Family disciples from Han and Zhao. Without the elder's command, he wouldn’t have dared to imagine what might happen.

“Who is that? Is it the eldest’s son?”

“Probably. I can’t think of anyone else whose descendant would be so fierce!”

“Damn, the eldest’s son is this strong?” Wu Di and his men stared in shock at Long Bao Bei.

After several breaths, the fire dragon’s energy gradually faded. A long blackened path of scorched earth appeared in people's sight.

Han and Zhao families’ groups emerged in a pitiful state. What had been two thousand disciples now numbered only hundreds, with Han Lihui and Zhao Hongyi protecting them.

What was strange was that several people stood scattered nearby, seemingly unharmed. But to their amusement, these individuals had a pool of water beneath them, eyes filled with fear as they gazed at Long Bao Bei like a monster.

Long Bao Bei’s face showed arrogance. He soared into the air, his small body instantly appearing behind those few people. His tiny foot kicked, and they were as if struck by a strange force, flying out like kites. They landed precisely under Zheng Xin and Leng Qiuchan.

Before the few people could land, Long Bao Bei returned to Zheng Xin and Leng Qiuchan’s side. His face bore a triumphant expression as he said to the trembling people: “Hmph, Zheng Xin elder, help me spank their bottoms!”

“Little brat, you seek death!” The Han and Zhao elders above the sky looked grotesque, roaring.

Han Lihui and Zhao Hongyi gazed at Long Bao Bei with trembling eyes. If the fire dragon had lasted a little longer, they would have been unable to endure.

After the two elders roared, another voice interrupted their plans to attack.

“Huang Family’s Huang Tiannu greets the Little Ancestor!” The Huang Family elder bowed respectfully, his aged body slightly bent as he shouted to Luo Tian, who was stunned.

“Little… Little Ancestor?”

“What is this thing?” Everyone’s faces bore disbelief as they looked at the Huang Family elder in the sky.

“Huang Tiannu, are you mad? Calling such a little beast your junior!” Han Family elder shouted.

Luo Tian’s lips twitched, looking at Huang Tiannu who had just fought him fiercely. His expression was puzzled, his gaze filled with oddity.

“Get lost… Han Tianya! Who are you calling a beast? Our Huang Family’s matters don’t concern you!” Huang Tiannu shouted back at Han Tianya.

“Wait… this elder, what’s going on? I’m confused!” Luo Tian looked at Huang Tiannu who no longer intended to fight, as if speaking truthfully.

“Little Ancestor, is your spear called Crackling Heaven? When we fought earlier, you used three spear techniques. The first was ‘Golden Snake Wild Dance,’ the second was ‘Gold and Stone Break,’ and the third was ‘Golden Sea Sifting Sand.’ I’m correct, right?” Huang Tiannu’s face showed excitement. His gaze was respectful as he looked at Luo Tian.

Hearing Huang Tiannu’s words, Luo Tian's eyes suddenly widened. He remembered the old man with the surname Huang he had met in the final level of the Ascension Stairs. He recalled the old man’s instructions.

Luo Tian shifted his gaze to the old man's forehead, a black mark engraved there. Then, Luo Tian’s spiritual sense erupted, scanning the foreheads of Huang Tianrui and Huang Boding. He found that some people had a mark on their foreheads.

“Ah, I see!” At this moment, Luo Tian fully understood. The Huang Family in Beichang County were indeed the descendants of that old man from the Ascension Stairs.

“Spear user, forehead mark, surname Huang! No mistake!” At this moment, Luo Tian suddenly understood. He felt a sense of guilt—had he forgotten this matter if not for meeting him?

“Elder, please rise. I can only be considered half a disciple of the Huang elder. He only gave me this crackling spear and three spear techniques!” Luo Tian wouldn’t allow Huang Tiannu to bow to him. He quickly approached Huang Tiannu and helped him up.

“Do you know if our family’s ancestor is still alive?” Huang Tiannu, upon hearing Luo Tian's confirmation, looked excited. He thought if their ancestor were still alive, the Huang Family might have a chance to leave Beichang County.

“Master Huang met me as a fragment of soul. After teaching me the three spear techniques, he vanished into the world!” Luo Tian sighed lightly, recalling that admirable old man.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Huang Tiannu looked disappointed. But he had already prepared for the possibility that their ancestor was gone.

“Since you are my family’s ancestor’s disciple, by rank, you are our Huang Family’s elder. What are you all waiting for? Pay homage to the elder!” Huang Tiannu roared at the Huang Family members on the ground.

Chapter 457: Pay Homage to the Elder

Chapter 457: Pay Homage to the Elder

Huang Tianrui and Huang Boding, along with other Huang Family members, stared at Luo Tian in the sky and Huang Tiannu. They were momentarily speechless.

Luo Tian looked to be around twenty, yet every Huang Family member present was older. If what Huang Tiannu said were true, they would have to kneel and pay homage. How could they do that?

Not only the Huang Family, but even Han and Zhao elders’ faces twitched as they looked at Huang Tiannu. After he had roared at them, he ordered the Huang Family to pay homage to Luo Tian. This situation even made them forget about their heavy losses.

“Too amazing! That’s the Huang Family elder from Beiming City, who called us Little Ancestor! I must have heard wrong!” Wu Di and his men looked astonished, then gazed at Luo Tian with intense eyes.

“Elder, I can only be considered half a disciple. You shouldn’t accept this!” Luo Tian looked embarrassed, looking at the white-haired Huang Tiannu.

“Half a disciple is still a disciple. You! Are my Huang Family’s elder! What are you all waiting for!” Huang Tiannu looked angry, his gaze scanning the Huang Family members.

Seeing their elder truly angry, Huang Tianrui and Huang Boding felt reluctant but knew their elder’s stubbornness. Once he decided something, it was impossible to change. Also, they respected the ancestor who founded the Huang Family.

“Homage to the elder!” Huang Tianrui knelt on the ground, suppressing his resentment.

“Homage to the elder!” Seeing their family head kneeling, Huang Boding and other Huang Family members also knelt.

Luo Tian awkwardly stood in the sky, his face flushed red. His spiritual sense spread over everyone, lifting the Huang Family’s nearly a thousand people.

“This… this…”

Luo Tian was at a loss, his face red as he stood there.

“Buzz…”

At this moment, a sound of breaking through the air entered Luo Tian’s ears. A terrifying blade energy, filled with dominance, sliced across the sky toward Huang Tiannu who was slightly bowing.

“Be careful!” Luo Tian roared, his spear raised. He took a step forward with the Boundless Heaven Step and blocked the terrifying blade energy.

“Crack…” A thunderous sound like lightning echoed in people’s ears.

“Han Tianya, Zhao Hongze! What do you mean!” Huang Tiannu looked furious, gazing at Han Tianya and Zhao Hongze who had rushed toward Luo Tian.

“Kill!” To everyone’s surprise, Yang Huanyu, who had been confronting the two elders, also moved. With a spear in hand, he rushed toward Luo Tian and Huang Tiannu.

“Treacherous!” Huang Tianrui and others on the ground immediately realized why the three had attacked Huang Tiannu.

The Huang, Zhao, and Han families had always been at odds in Beiming City. Their elders and family strengths were equal. Now that Huang Tiannu had called Luo Tian “Little Ancestor,” the Huang Family’s strength had surpassed the other two. How could they accept that?

“Kill these scum!” Huang Tianrui roared, attacking the Han and Zhao disciples.

With Huang Tianrui’s command, the Huang Family disciples seemed to have gained energy. They rushed toward the Han and Zhao disciples.

The two families’ disciples had no desire to fight after Long Bao Bei’s fire dragon. Those from various families who had previously raided Wu Tian were also heavily wounded. Combined, they numbered only eight hundred.

The Huang Family disciples had suffered no harm. They seemed like wolves surrounding sheep.

In terms of high-level combat power, Zheng Xin, Leng Qiuchan, and Huang Tianrui and Huang Boding were top-tier. Though the enemy was numerous, Han Lihui and Zhao Hongyi were at the bone-formation peak. However, Zheng Xin and Leng Qiuchan’s methods were astonishing—facing two opponents was no problem.

Long Bao Bei flew into the sky, blocking Yang Huanyu’s path. His face bore a serious expression. His instinct told him this person posed more danger than the other two elders.

“Long Bao Bei, go down!” Luo Tian commanded, not wanting Long Bao Bei to be harmed.

“No!” Long Bao Bei’s face showed stubbornness. He punched, releasing dragon power toward Yang Huanyu.

Seeing Long Bao Bei’s determined expression, Luo Tian furrowed his brows. Though Yang Huanyu was at the Nascent Soul Initial Stage, Luo Tian knew his true strength could rival the Nascent Soul Mid-Stage. Plus, his methods were cunning.

But Luo Tian also knew Long Bao Bei’s stubborn personality. Though he usually obeyed him, sometimes he was as unyielding as anyone else.

Thinking this, Luo Tian struck back Zhao Hongze’s attack. He moved swiftly to block Long Bao Bei's path: “You take on that old man, I’ll handle this!”

Long Bao Bei frowned. Seeing Zhao Hongze approaching, he took a step forward and rushed toward him. Huang Tiannu was already locked in battle with Han Tianya.

Everyone feared collateral damage, as there were still their descendants below. Six Nascent Soul Realm masters’ battles would be unbearable for those below.

The battlefield’s chaos resumed. The only relief was Wu Tian's members, who were all injured. They couldn’t help in the battle and watched with admiration at the powerful fluctuations above.

Six Nascent Soul Realm masters clashed, locked in a stalemate. Killing each other was difficult unless it was self-destruction or massive strength differences, like before with Luo Tian and Qi Feiying.

But Luo Tian, Long Bao Bei, and Yang Huanyu were all comparable to Nascent Soul Mid-Stage masters. Even more so, Long Bao Bei’s formidable physical body was unmatched by any attack. This shocked Luo Tian and others, who hadn’t expected the strongest among them to be this child.

“Enough!” Yang Huanyu blocked Luo Tian’s spear, stepping back with a playful smile.

Seeing Yang Huanyu retreat, Luo Tian didn’t give him any breathing space. He took a deep breath and followed closely.

“Wait, you won’t chase me anymore! Let’s explode!” Yang Huanyu smiled, ignoring Luo Tian approaching. He roared.

As Yang Huanyu’s words ended, the blood-red soul-restraining pearls deep underground stopped moving, as if finding their place.

“Boom…” A series of faint glass-breaking sounds echoed underground.

“Buzz…” A stream of blood energy, like blood, rose from the ground, resisting the immense pressure beneath.

Chapter 458: The Soul-Calling Array Unfolds

Chapter 458: The Soul-Calling Array Unfolds

A dozen soul-restraining pearls shattered, emitting strong blood energy. They continued to move underground, as if drawing a pattern.

In several breaths, the blood energy beneath the ground finally coalesced. A dazzling red light emerged under the earth. If someone could see it, a vast array would be formed beneath the ground, its location where Huang Family and other families were clashing.

Seeing Yang Huanyu only dodging without confronting him directly, Luo Tian felt a slight confusion.

“Sleeping ancient凶魂 (evil souls), you have been asleep for tens of thousands of years. Today… with my name… using the blood of a million living beings as an offering, awaken! My subordinates!” Yang Huanyu’s face bore solemnity. He whispered lowly.

Hearing Yang Huanyu's whisper, Luo Tian’s face shifted slightly. Though he didn’t know what Yang Huanyu was up to, a bad premonition stirred within him. It felt like he had entered Yang Huanyu’s trap again.

At the same time, Huang Tiannu and four others stopped fighting. Their gazes held confusion as they looked at Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu. As Nascent Soul Realm masters, they were sensitive to changes in the world. Intuitively, four of them felt a danger approaching.

“Buzz…” A powerful rumbling sound suddenly echoed from underground, entering people’s ears.

“In the ground!” Long Bao Bei finally noticed something was wrong and shouted at Luo Tian and others.

Hearing Long Bao Bei’s warning, Luo Tian and others quickly sent their spiritual senses underground. Their faces turned pale immediately, no longer caring about the opponent. They flew down from the sky.

“Too late!” Yang Huanyu’s lips curled slightly. His hands moved swiftly, creating seals that flew toward the ground.

The fighting families below suddenly felt the ground tremble. They stopped their fight, as the trembling grew stronger and made it impossible to stand.

“Fall back!” The elders of the families roared, using their spiritual energy to form large hands and pull their disciples up.

Luo Tian did the same. After exploring underground, he felt as if hell’s gate was opening. The blood-red array seemed to connect with the world's power, something terrifying emerging from it.

“Haha, too long. You’ve forgotten who your ancestors were!” Yang Huanyu moved his hands lightly, strange symbols flying from them. They formed a vast net in the sky.

At this moment, the three families’ disciples—Huang Family, Han Family, and Zhao Family—had a faint red light on their foreheads. A crescent moon mark appeared on each disciple’s forehead, including the three elders.

“This is!” Han Family elder Han Tianya looked shocked. He gazed at his few remaining clan members, his voice trembling with fear. Then he looked at Huang Tiannu and Zhao Hongze.

The three exchanged glances, then seemed to recall something. Their faces bore intense fear as they looked at Yang Huanyu in the sky.

“Do you remember?” Yang Huanyu smiled, his gaze toward them like looking at an ant.

Luo Tian sent Wu Tian’s people to Huang Family's side. Then, with a cautious expression, he approached Huang Family elder.

“What’s going on?” Luo Tian looked wary as he asked.

Hearing Luo Tian's question, Huang Tiannu’s face showed bitterness. He spoke softly: “I didn’t expect the ancestral teachings to be true. Someone really did awaken the seals within us!”

“Yes, old Huang. What do we do now? We have no way out. These seals are inside us…” Han Tianya and Zhao Hongze approached, obviously unable to continue fighting.

“Elder, this is how it goes…” Huang Tiannu explained to Luo Tian, who looked puzzled.

After Huang Tiannu’s quick explanation, Luo Tian finally understood. His face showed realization.

In ancient times, an elder of the Huang Family—this one who taught Luo Tian the crackling spear—founded the Huang Family and then traveled.

With a high-level soul-restraining master in place, though not stationed within the family, the Huang Family was untouchable in that region. Plus, the second-generation elder had reached the soul-restraining realm over time. Thus, the Huang Family was among the top families in that era.

But their good fortune ended during a disaster, turning them into this lifeless state.

One day, a powerful black-cloaked person suddenly entered the Huang Family. Just one man defeated all of their masters. Even the second-generation elder, who fought him, was no match and was killed. His blood was taken.

Afterward, this black-cloaked person used supernatural means to move the Huang Family to Beichang County and placed seals on their bodies, forever preventing them from leaving Beichang County.

The same fate befell the Zhao and Han families. They were all forcibly moved here by an unknown person.

After the three families arrived in Beichang County, a great power built walls and stationed guards to watch over this place. It became like a prison.

After hearing the story, Luo Tian felt sympathy for the three families’ disciples. Once top-tier families outside, they now lived in Beichang County like ghosts.

“Can this seal be broken? For so many years, your family elders and ancestors never thought of a way?” Luo Tian asked. He knew this seal was definitely no good, especially now that Yang Huanyu had activated it.

“Thousands of years. Our three families have tried to study how to open this seal, but only made some progress. We weren’t sure. No one has ever activated it before, so we’ve forgotten about this seal. If not for now being activated, we might have truly forgotten!” Huang Tiannu looked bitter as he explained.

“Tell me how to break it! Maybe we can find a way. This situation is too passive!” Luo Tian looked anxious. The Huang Family had treated him well, and he didn’t want them to suffer any losses.

Chapter 459: The Crisis of the Three Families

Chapter 459: The Crisis of the Three Families

Standing in the sky, Yang Huanyu furrowed his brows. He sighed softly: “Thousands of bodies from the cultivation stage and tens of thousands of commoners’ blood, plus a Nascent Soul Realm master’s essence—still couldn’t call you out?”

“Hmph, I was prepared!” Yang Huanyu smiled, his hands forming strange gestures.

“Go! Eternal servants!” Yang Huanyu’s face showed a sinister expression. His cold voice echoed from his mouth.

“Boom…” As Yang Huanyu’s words ended, a explosion sound echoed in Luo Tian and the three elders’ ears.

In their spiritual senses, one of Han Family’s disciples had his crescent moon mark explode. This cultivation stage eight disciple lost his life.

This wasn’t over. After the head exploded, the youth’s blood flew out and formed a red light toward the gradually emerging blood-red array.

“This bastard must be the descendant who brought our ancestors here!” Huang Tiannu and Han Tianya and Zhao Hongze looked at Yang Huanyu in the sky with madness.

At this moment, Yang Huanyu wore a confident demeanor. His forehead bore an eerie crescent moon emitting bloodlight.

Though Yang Huanyu had no oppressive aura, the feeling of being controlled by others in one’s soul made the three elders’ faces show madness. They felt that even if they were told to die, they would do so without hesitation.

“Boom… Boom…” As the three elders cursed inwardly, explosion sounds entered their ears. Their eyes turned blood-red. Their bodies felt as if bound by chains, unable to move.

“Elder, save the Huang Family!” Huang Tiannu looked anxious, gazing at Luo Tian with a pleading expression.

Seeing disciples dying without reason, the three elders felt frustrated. Plus, they didn’t know if they would be next.

“How can we save them?” Luo Tian asked seriously. The Huang Family had treated him well. If he could help, he would definitely do so. Especially for the debt of gratitude from Huang Family’s elder who had taught him the crackling spear.

But this seal was a mystery to Luo Tian. He didn’t know where to start.

“After our family’s elders researched, this seal is extremely evil. It requires righteous energy—hao ran zheng qi—to break it. Whether it’s spiritual energy, techniques, or treasures with extreme righteousness, they can all break it!” Huang Tiannu looked anxious. The Huang Family’s cultivation stage masters had already died, and the damage spread to the bone-formation stage.

“Righteous energy!” Luo Tian furrowed his brows.

The Yuling Sect was skilled in sealing. Leng Qiuchan also thought deeply, then her eyes flashed with light. Her cold voice echoed under the black veil: “Greenwood Emperor’s Scripture!”

Hearing Leng Qiuchan’s whisper, Luo Tian's eyes lit up. He suddenly remembered the Emperor’s energy of the Greenwood Emperor’s Scripture, which was exactly what Huang Tiannu called righteous energy.

After thinking this through, Luo Tian flew to Huang Tianrui’s side. His face bore solemnity as he silently activated the Greenwood Emperor’s Scripture in his body. The wood-element energy, with Emperor's aura, formed a wooden spear in the sky.

“Greenwood Emperor’s Spear!” Zheng Xin looked astonished, gazing at Luo Tian. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be able to summon the Greenwood Emperor’s spear of Yuling Sect.

At the moment the Greenwood Emperor’s Spear materialized, Huang Tiannu looked happy. He could clearly feel that when the Emperor's spear appeared, his seal power seemed to have a weakness.

“Greenwood Emperor, subdue all!” Luo Tian roared, the green spear slowly descending toward Huang Tianrui.

“Buzz…” The emerald spear, with Emperor’s aura, slowly sliced toward Huang Tianrui.

Huang Tianrui naturally felt the Emperor's spear’s appearance. His body seemed to obey it, but he didn’t dodge. Instead, his eyes held anticipation as the spear approached him.
