“Another Soul Sealing Master’s trick… Who could it be?” Luo Tian gritted his teeth, recalling the Soul Sealing Master who had possessed Sun Miechen back in the celestial race. That master had never revealed himself.

“It must be him,” Luo Tian murmured to himself, recalling how Chen Zhanbiao had once been captured by the celestial race. It must have been then that the soul seed was implanted!

Luo Tian’s gaze shifted to Sha Man.

“This is problematic. Our race has a lineage known as the Soul Sealing Masters, and one of their techniques is called Nourishing Soul. Those afflicted enter eternal slumber without any signs of distress.”

“But look closely—does Chen Zhanbiao’s forehead bear a faint lotus mark?” Luo Tian addressed Sha Man, then pointed at Chen Zhanbiao’s brow.

“Hm?” Sha Man furrowed his brows, then gazed at Chen Zhanbiao’s forehead. His expression abruptly darkened.

Indeed, a faint, ethereal lotus mark adorned Chen Zhanbiao’s brow. Without meticulous spiritual awareness, it would be imperceptible.

“Something's wrong,” Sha Man shook his head. “We examined him thoroughly before, but found no mark. It’s impossible to be mistaken.”

“Indeed,” Luo Tian asked, his voice laced with a cold smirk. “How long has Chen Zhanbiao been asleep?”

“Approximately a year,” Sha Man mused, calculating the days before meeting Luo Tian’s gaze.

“Correct. Nourishing Soul requires three years: the first year, the mark appears; the second, three lotus leaves form; the third, it reaches completion. That is when the practitioner reaps their reward,” Luo Tian intoned.

“Reap?” Though Sha Man did not grasp the meaning, a strange unease settled in his chest.

“Precisely. When it reaches completion, the soul automatically drifts from the body to seek its practitioner, who then absorbs it to strengthen their own spirit,” Luo Tian explained.

“Alternatively, the soul may remain within the original body, but it would be controlled by the one who implanted the Nourishing Soul,” Luo Tian’s voice carried an icy chill, causing Sha Man to shiver involuntarily.

“Terrifying. I never imagined the human race possessed such terrifying individuals!” Sha Man’s face bore fear, perceiving Luo Tian’s Soul Sealing Master as truly formidable.

“Is there a way to break it?” Sha Man’s face lit with hope. At present, only Luo Tian could save Chen Zhanbiao; he had never heard of such a Soul Sealing Master before.

“It is indeed difficult. Moreover, the practitioner seems to know I am also a Soul Sealing Master and has set certain traps. Even another Soul Sealing Master finds it challenging,” Luo Tian admitted.

Upon hearing this, Sha Man’s expression darkened. He had not expected Luo Tian to be a formidable Soul Sealing Master, nor that even he found it insurmountable.

“Still, after these days of observation, I’ve gained some insight. Give me more time—I should be able to break it,” Luo Tian said.

“I need your help. Bring forth all the spiritual herbs and sacred medicines capable of mending souls,” Luo Tian requested directly.

“Understood. I’ll issue the order immediately. Also, I’ll have Manhun search for sacred medicines to mend souls—perhaps we can find something,” Sha Man replied softly.

“Thank you,” Sha Man nodded, gazing at Luo Tian with gratitude in his eyes.

“No need for thanks, elder. Zhanbiao is my brother. Compared to you, I wish more for his recovery,” Luo Tian sighed softly, his gaze heavy with concern.

“By the way, elder, have you discovered who targeted the蛮族?” Luo Tian inquired.

“Not yet,” Sha Man’s expression turned cold. He had scrutinized the matter but found no answers. He did not believe three epoch masters would dare rebel; someone must be backing them. Even something as potent as Wu Xiang Bing Yuan’s “Frostless Elixir” was beyond what Meng Wende and his allies could obtain.

“Perhaps the mastermind is another clan. After all, your presence forced them to act prematurely,” Sha Man sighed deeply.

“Perhaps they targeted you specifically,” Sha Man added, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian.

“Hm,” Luo Tian nodded. He too felt they were after him; if he hadn’t appeared, Meng Wende’s trio would have delayed their plan, making it safer.

“Who is it?” Luo Tian pondered, feeling a vast net had long encircled him and those around him.

“Prove your worth. No matter who you are, I shall crush you!” Luo Tian muttered softly, his gaze resolute.

“Elder, there is another matter I wish to discuss with you,” Luo Tian said softly, his tone solemn.

“An alliance?” Sha Man, perceptive as ever, guessed Luo Tian’s intent. A smile flickered across his face.

“Indeed,” Luo Tian nodded, then continued: “Zhanbiao is the son of a蛮族 king. Yet he was raised among humans. When he awakens, he will surely stand with the human race. Thus, it is better for you to ally with us!”

“Agreed,” Sha Man smiled, nodding. “Once the king’s son awakens, everything else is manageable. Moreover, our蛮族 does not wish to involve itself in conflicts with the human race. I can assure you, if war erupts, we will remain neutral.”

Chapter 1686: Healing

Upon hearing Sha Man’s words, Luo Tian, though prepared, felt a surge of joy. Another formidable enemy had been eliminated.

“Much easier now,” Luo Tian mused internally, calculating the strength of the Ancient Clans and humans.

The alliance between Star Moon Celestial Clan and蛮族 had significantly weakened the Ancient Clans, leaving only the Qilin Clan, Feathered Clan, Hun Tian Clan, Blood Clan, and Golden Crow Clan—six major clans. Though powerful, the human race was not without strength.

“Boy, don’t blame me for not warning you. Though our蛮族 will remain neutral, I assume you’ve made some arrangement with Star Moon Celestial Clan. However, the other clans remain formidable,” Sha Man cautioned.

“As far as I know, the elders of our clans have all lived through a second life. Qihongrui has already emerged; I suspect the others will soon follow. At that point, relying solely on those three masters won’t be enough to deter them,” Sha Man added.

“Moreover, I must clarify—I will not oppose you four Holy Star Domains. If war erupts, we cannot escape. Other clans might unite to crush us first,” Sha Man warned.

“Others must still be opposed,” he added, echoing Fu Wenzhen’s stance.

“We蛮族 never fully eradicated the human race. Consider this: in the Origin Domain, only our蛮族 continent and human presence remain. You think we lacked the power to destroy the Seven Star Island?” Sha Man mused, a hint of sorrow in his voice.

“Everything has its reason. The human race cannot be eradicated, even in war,” Sha Man shook his head. Though he did not wish for conflict with humans, circumstances might force him to act.

“Understood,” Luo Tian nodded. He had no grand expectations; this outcome was within his acceptance.

“Then, I entrust Zhanbiao to you,” Sha Man said before exiting the hall.

“Even the king’s son holds such status among the Ancient Clans. Zhanbiao, who has never returned to蛮族, still commands such reverence,” Luo Tian mused, gazing at Chen Zhanbiao.

“Though Nourishing Soul harms Zhanbiao, breaking it might elevate his soul to a new level. His strength would then surge,” Luo Tian mused.

“No matter who you are, I will ensure your plan fails. You shall become Zhanbiao’s sacrifice!” Luo Tian closed his eyes, entering meditation. Seven days had drained him; he too needed rest.

Time passed slowly. After the turmoil,蛮族 gradually settled. Yet, three families were absent from the Wild City, making it feel emptier.

Luo Tian, who had nearly saved蛮族 from destruction, was constantly spoken of. People recalled the fierce battle days before.

Luo Tian’s identity became a topic of conversation among蛮族. However, the truth could not be hidden for long; his identity spread through the clan, causing a stir.

“Human! So what? I know only that without him, we wouldn’t be here now. Perhaps he would have been slain by those three traitors!” Though the蛮族 learned Luo Tian’s identity, their straightforward nature did not let it bother them.

Yet this was only for Luo Tian. For other humans, the蛮族 still harbored hostility.

Seven days passed. Luo Tian sat in meditation within the hall, his aura gradually rising. His lips curled slightly as he opened his eyes.

“Regained my peak strength!” Luo Tian murmured, standing up. He approached Chen Zhanbiao’s bed.

“Hum…” He waved his hand, sending waves of spiritual energy. Gray soul force凝聚 into a blade before him.

“First, break the outer defense!” Luo Tian’s eyes darkened. The gray soul blade slashed toward Chen Zhanbiao.

“Hum…” Feeling the threat, Chen Zhanbiao’s body glowed with golden light, enveloping him.

“Though it may work for others, it’s nothing to me, a fellow Soul Sealing Master!” Luo Tian pointed his finger. The soul blade hummed and struck Chen Zhanbiao.

“Crack…” A dull sound echoed as the soul blade shattered, dispersing into gray mist. The waves of energy swept through the hall.

“Again!” Luo Tian did not falter, summoning another soul blade to strike Chen Zhanbiao.

“Crack…” The result was the same. The soul blade disintegrated, and waves of energy swept through the hall.

Though the soul blade was destroyed, a gray mark remained on Chen Zhanbiao’s body, noticeable.

“Good enough!” Luo Tian smiled. He continued to strike Chen Zhanbiao with soul blades.

“Crack…” After a day of relentless effort, the seal on Chen Zhanbiao’s body was finally shattered.

Yet Luo Tian paid a heavy price. His face was pale, and the ground beneath him was soaked with sweat.

“Hum…” The hum echoed as the barrier on Chen Zhanbiao’s body was lifted. A powerful spiritual aura radiated from him, overwhelming even Luo Tian.

“Only a year, yet so strong!” Luo Tian’s face was pale as he sat on the ground. He felt Chen Zhanbiao’s soul had grown more than double, nearly matching his own peak.

“Next, I must remove the Nourishing Soul. I need to fully recover my strength,” Luo Tian’s expression turned serious. He retrieved a gray pill, a soul-repairing medicine crafted by Sha Man.

Without hesitation, Luo Tian swallowed the pill and resumed meditation.

Time passed slowly. After fifteen days of rest, Luo Tian’s complexion returned to normal. He stood up, his brows furrowed.

“Still not fully recovered,” Luo Tian murmured. Though he had regained his strength, his cultivation had yet to reach the Provisional Epoch Lord level.

“If only I had a Immortal-Reviving Herb, it would be easier!” Luo Tian did not continue treating Chen Zhanbiao but stepped out of the hall.

“Luo Tian!” As he exited, Manhun appeared before him. For these days, Manhun and Sha Man had taken turns guarding Luo Tian.

“Improved slightly. The outer seal has been broken. Next, I must remove the lotus and erase the Soul Sealing Master’s mark,” Luo Tian nodded at Manhun, his expression pained. Once enemies, now allies.

“Any difficulties?” Manhun asked, puzzled. He knew Luo Tian’s bond with Chen Zhanbiao was deep; he would not stand by.

“Indeed, my cultivation hasn’t returned to peak. I dare not act recklessly. This is my first time breaking Nourishing Soul, so I need to recover fully for better chances,” Luo Tian sighed.

“Recovery? How can you restore your strength? I sense your aura is nearly at the Provisional Lord level,” Manhun asked, puzzled.

“Indeed, I feel my cultivation is just a step away from recovery. Yet something seems missing—my injury was too severe.”

“During these days, I’ve been pondering. I think it’s about lifespan,” Luo Tian said with a bitter smile.

“Lifespan?” Manhun’s face darkened. Though he knew Luo Tian had been severely injured, he hadn’t expected a loss of lifespan.

Lifespan was precious even for cultivators. Many masters fell to it, and most sought immortality.

“How much did you lose?” Manhun asked, his expression grave. He sensed the severity of the situation; if it was minimal, a longevity-extending sacred herb could restore it.

“At least a million years,” Luo Tian said with a bitter smile, lamenting the cost of that one strike.

“Million years!” Manhun inhaled sharply. Ordinarily, a Provisional Lord lived five million years. Luo Tian had lost a million—how terrifying.

Chapter 1687: Return

“Nothing too bad. Sacrifice and gain,” Luo Tian shook his head, unbothered by the loss of a million years. After all, he was still young in the cultivation world.

“You have a bold heart! That means your cultivation won’t recover until your lifespan does,” Manhun said with a bitter smile.

“No, by nature it should recover. Just slower—perhaps one or two years…”

“I can wait, but Zhanbiao cannot. I must recover my strength quickly—only then can I replenish my lifespan,” Luo Tian shook his head.

“Immortal-Reviving Herb!” Manhun said, one word at a time. He immediately understood Luo Tian’s intent—only an unparalleled Immortal-Reviving Herb could quickly restore vitality.

“Indeed. I must return to the Four Holy Star Domains to use it, replenishing my lifespan as much as possible. In that time, I entrust Zhanbiao to you,” Luo Tian said softly.

“Return quickly. He’s in your care; I and Sha Man will protect him,” Manhun nodded, knowing the Four Holy Star Domains had Immortal-Reviving Herbs. After all, they had met there to vie for the Purple Dawn Lotus.

“Tell Sha Man elder and Chu Chen to help watch over him,” Luo Tian waved his hand, summoning Chu Chen, who was bewildered.

These days had driven Chu Chen mad. After Luo Tian quelled the rebellion of three clans, he focused on healing Zhanbiao, leaving no room for interruption. Now that Luo Tian stopped treating him, Chu Chen finally protested, reminding Luo Tian of his presence.

“Don’t worry. This boy is talented; I’ll use him well. The Wild City currently lacks people,” Manhun smiled.

“I’m leaving then,” Luo Tian smiled, patting Chu Chen’s shoulder before stepping out of the Wild City.

“Wait!” As Luo Tian took a few steps, Elder Sha Man’s aged voice echoed in their ears.

“Elder!” Luo Tian bowed slightly, his face puzzled.

“You said you’d return to the Four Holy Star Domains for an Immortal-Reviving Herb?” Elder Sha Man asked.

“Indeed,” Luo Tian nodded, puzzled why the elder asked. He must have heard their conversation.

“Must it be a whole one?” Elder Sha Man pondered before asking.

“Probably not. I think just a fragment would suffice. No need to fully replenish my lost lifespan,” Luo Tian shook his head. Though Zhanbiao’s life was precious, he would use the whole herb if necessary but preferred to save.

“I think you don’t need to return. Our蛮族 doesn’t have a whole one, but we do have an incomplete one—stored in the Divine Spirit Palace,” Sha Man said with a smile.

“Really?” Luo Tian’s face lit up. Returning to the Four Holy Star Domains would waste time and risk trouble along the way.

“Hum…” Sha Man waved his hand, revealing a blue leaf before Luo Tian and Manhun.

Though just a leaf, Luo Tian felt its vitality far exceeded ordinary sacred herbs.

“Huan Gu Cha Shu (Dreaming Ancient Tea Tree), a relic left by our蛮族’s Divine Spirit. Later, it vanished, leaving only three leaves. This is one; the other two were used during our clan’s crisis,” Sha Man explained, his voice tinged with nostalgia. This was a second life, now revealed.

“Elder, I’ll repay this favor when the chance comes,” Luo Tian said without hesitation, taking the leaf and placing it in his mouth. He sat cross-legged to refine it.

Sha Man and Manhun stepped out of the hall, guarding Luo Tian while sensing his aura.

A stream of refining energy acted on the leaf. Simultaneously, powerful vitality flowed into Luo Tian’s body, nourishing him. His aura gradually rose.

Perceiving his lifespan increasing day by day, Luo Tian felt a surge of power.

“Boom…” Three days passed swiftly. Luo Tian fully refined the leaf, his body radiating powerful aura.

A golden cycle of reincarnation贯穿ed his dantian. Spiritual light flowed, and the aura of a Provisional Epoch Lord radiated from him.

“Has it recovered?” Sha Man and Manhun, outside the hall, felt the overwhelming aura. They spoke softly.

“Unsurpassed! He survived a second life from masters and four Provisional Lords. This aura makes me feel powerful!” Sha Man marveled.

“This变态 wants to take advantage of his weakened state. Seems no chance now!” Manhun’s face bore bitterness. He was a prodigy but knew he and Luo Tian had gaps. If it were him, he wouldn’t have escaped.

Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, a smile on his face. He clenched his fists, and fine cracks of void appeared around them.

“Finally restored my cultivation. It seems I’ve made progress. Indeed, an Immortal-Reviving Herb can let an Epoch Lord live a second life. Though my lifespan isn’t fully restored, it’s irrelevant!” Luo Tian murmured, his eyes glowing. He gazed at Chen Zhanbiao.

“Zhanbiao has slept long enough!” Luo Tian smiled, approaching Chen Zhanbiao. Gray soul force emerged from his body, floating before him. Without hesitation, he dove toward Chen Zhanbiao.

“Hum…” The hum echoed. In an instant, Luo Tian’s soul force entered Chen Zhanbiao’s body, locating his soul.

A gray flower hovered in Chen Zhanbiao’s dantian. Its aura made Luo Tian feel awe. Chen Zhanbiao’s vast soul lay on the gray lotus, surrounded by swirling gray mist.

Gray mist entered Chen Zhanbiao’s soul with each breath, nourishing it.

“Already grown so much!” Luo Tian mused. His eyes turned cold.

“Whoever planted this soul seed on my brother—no matter who you are, I’ll make you suffer!” Luo Tian coldly declared. His hands moved, sending gray mist from his palms toward the lotus.

“Hum…” The hum echoed. A wave of rejection emerged from the lotus, as if sensing Luo Tian’s threat. The gray petals trembled, emitting a powerful soul force that coalesced into an illusory figure before Luo Tian.

“This is still Zhanbiao’s body. The soul seed is almost fused with him, so it won’t reject me—perhaps even help fight against me,” Luo Tian felt the rejection from Zhanbiao’s body. His eyes narrowed.

“Still, it won’t work!” Luo Tian rushed toward the gray figure.

The lotus-formed gray figure, though illusory, radiated a powerful aura. It too rushed toward Luo Tian.

“Kill!” Luo Tian roared, his gray soul clashing with the figure. His soul retreated slightly, but he smiled.

“Such power to drive me out? Dream on!” Luo Tian sneered, charging again. They clashed in battle.

Meanwhile, outside the Wild City, a massive figure appeared beyond its borders.

“What’s happening? The clan artifact sealed the continent!” An elder furrowed his brows, then took a step. The golden barrier surrounding the Wild City shattered.

“Crack…” A brittle sound echoed across the Wild City. All Wild Giants looked surprised and awed at the shattered barrier.

“Hm?” Sha Man and Manhun’s eyes flickered. Sha Man vanished from the Divine Spirit Palace, appearing in the sky. He saw a massive figure stepping into the Wild City from beyond the domain.

“Elder!” Sha Man’s face lit up with joy, bowing to the elder.

“It’s our clan’s elder returning from the Thunder Sea Marsh. He lived a second life!” All Wild City people saw the figure, radiant like the sun. They bowed respectfully.

Chapter 1688: Dream Illusion

“What’s happening?” The elder’s face darkened, sensing the Wild City’s unease. He had just lived a second life and returned to find it changed—the clan artifact protected the continent, clearly indicating something was wrong.

“Three families rebelled!” Elder Sha Man approached the elder, recounting the events of these days.

“Did the king’s son return? That human boy is healing him?” The elder’s face shifted.

“Yes. The king’s son sleeps, apparently ensnared by the human race. Luo Tian is healing him fully,” Elder Sha Man replied softly.

“Unexpectedly, so much has happened while we were away!” The elder’s face turned cold. He knew Meng Wende and his allies might have hidden support.

“This grudge cannot be ignored. Investigate! We must find who’s behind it!” The elder, now a second-life master, was undeterred by any crisis.

“Also, why did you let that human boy heal the king’s son? You know all the Ancient Clans are searching for him. He’s now a hot potato!” The elder scolded, though he had lived a second life.

“Other clans avoid him. Yet you let him stay in the Wild City! And even allied with him!” The elder’s face bore reproach. Though he had lived a second life, his words to Elder Sha Man were not harsh.

“He saved our Wild City! And in the future war, it’s a backdoor for us!” Elder Sha Man persuaded.

“Still, I disagree! A mere human boy—what right does he have to ally with us?” Manzhan coldly spoke.

“I know. You’re upset because he nearly split you in the past. But now, healing the king’s son is the top priority!” Elder Sha Man said solemnly, his gaze deep.

“Still, I refuse. Unless he defeats me, there’s no deal. Even if you agree, it won’t help!” Manzhan said softly. Elder Sha Man was right—after the Ancient Clans’ battle, he had long harbored resentment toward Luo Tian.

“Fine. Let’s discuss it after he emerges. You’ve just returned; rest and recount the Thunder Domain’s situation. Have all of you emerged?” Sha Man sighed, gazing at Manzhan.

“Fine,” they nodded. They vanished from the Wild City’s sight, causing a stir among its people.

“Did you hear? The elder wants Luo Tian to defeat him before yielding!”
“Unfair! The elder is a second-life powerhouse!” The Wild City buzzed with discussion.

“But Luo Tian isn’t an easy opponent. Though his cultivation hasn’t recovered, if he does, he might defeat a second-life master!” Some countered. After all, Luo Tian was renowned.

“Impossible! But I support the elder. Though Luo Tian helped us, the elder is our clan’s foundation!” The Wild City echoed with two voices—supporting Manzhan and Luo Tian.

“Boom…” At this moment, Luo Tian was unaware of the outside commotion. His gray soul shattered the figure formed by the lotus, taking a deep breath.

“Third!” Luo Tian’s eyes glowed. He gazed at the lotus, which no longer formed a soul. A smile graced his face.

“Too exhausting,” Luo Tian murmured. Though the three souls were weaker than him, they had drained him.

“Show your strength! This method is too weak!” Luo Tian spoke solemnly, gazing at the lotus.

“Hum…” The lotus emitted waves of gray mist, filling Chen Zhanbiao’s dantian. It was like a gray fog obscuring Luo Tian’s vision.

“Roar…” A low growl echoed in Luo Tian’s perception. A sinister aura rose from the lotus.

“Soul Sealing!” Luo Tian’s gray hands moved, summoning spiritual energy into serpentine glyphs. They surged toward the lotus, wrapping it.

“Hum…” The energy rose. In an instant, Luo Tian felt his environment change—golden silk pillows, a warm body lying on a luxurious bed. Her face was shy, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian!” A whisper echoed in his ears. It carried a strong allure, making Luo Tian’s face change.

“Qianxue!” Luo Tian’s eyes went blank. He recognized the figure in thin silk—his long-lost Gu Qianxue.

Though they hadn’t met for a while, his longing for her had not wavered. The war had restrained him from seeking her further. And Gu Qianxue might have ascended to immortality, so he had buried his longing.

Yet now, her presence before him made his heart tremble for a moment.

Though it was just a brief lapse, it let her ensnare him. His eyes became dazed, filled with longing.

“I miss you!” Luo Tian embraced her in thin silk, whispering softly.

“Me too,” Gu Qianxue’s alluring voice echoed. It completely ensnared Luo Tian, and before he knew it, he had carried her to the golden bed.

“Sleep. Just sleep,” a soft voice said. Luo Tian’s weary soul felt drowsiness, and he slowly closed his eyes.

Outside, Luo Tian’s gray soul was dazed. He took a step toward the lotus, each step dispersing his soul force, absorbed by the lotus’s pull.

Luo Tian cradled Gu Qianxue, feeling fulfilled. He closed his eyes, drowsiness overtaking him as he lay on the bed.

As Luo Tian closed his eyes, his gray soul stood before the lotus. Roots of the lotus emitted gray soul threads, wrapping him like a cocoon. It seemed to establish some connection, continuously siphoning his soul force.

“Elder!” As Luo Tian was about to fall asleep, a distant voice echoed in his mind. He startled and sat up.

“What’s wrong?” Gu Qianxue asked, puzzled. Her body was still warm, but it made Luo Tian’s eyes clearer.

“Too powerful a lotus. It used my moment of daze to cast an illusion!” Luo Tian gazed at the warm Gu Qianxue, startled.

“You’re not Qianxue!” Luo Tian gazed at the figure in thin silk, sneered, then unleashed a fierce aura. His hands moved, and golden seals struck the room’s ceiling.

“Boom…” The thunderous sound echoed. In an instant, Luo Tian’s vision shattered. The luxurious room and Gu Qianxue vanished from his sight.

“Huff…” Luo Tian’s gray eyes gradually cleared. He tried to wipe sweat but found his soul immobile, his face darkening.

“Damn!” He saw his situation. His soul was at its weakest.

“Open up!” Luo Tian roared, unleashing his soul force to break free. Yet it was futile.
