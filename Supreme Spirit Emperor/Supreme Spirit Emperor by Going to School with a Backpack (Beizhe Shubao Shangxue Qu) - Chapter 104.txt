Like always, Ning Yuer walked towards the door. Two years ago, she had been taken by Luo Tian into the Five Elements Sect and was temporarily staying in her small courtyard, with plans to send her to the Gu Family soon. However, Luo Tian hadn't anticipated that he would leave to lure in the strength of the Corpse Sect and forgot about it entirely.

"Ah..." Upon seeing a person seated on the stone tablet, Ning Yuer let out a startled cry. But upon recognizing the visitor, her face showed disbelief and she rubbed her eyes again.

"Little girl, don't you recognize me anymore?" Luo Tian's face softened as he approached Ning Yuer and gently patted her slightly dazed head.

"Luo Tian Senior!" A look of excitement spread across Ning Yuer's face as she threw herself into Luo Tian's arms, tears streaming uncontrollably down her cheeks.

Luo Tian felt a warm form dart into his arms, and his chest was instantly dampened. He gave a slight start.

Ning's mother heard Ning Yuer's startled cry and stepped out of the room. Upon seeing Luo Tian, she was momentarily stunned before noticing Ning Yuer in his arms and a smile appeared on her face.

"Cough... cough..." Ning's mother lightly cleared her throat.

Hearing her mother's cough, Ning Yuer suddenly snapped out of it. Her face flushed as she darted from Luo Tian's arms, still with tears on her cheeks and eyes filled with excitement as she gazed at Luo Tian.

"Alright, don't cry. I've returned, haven't I?" A look of indulgence appeared on Luo Tian's face as he wiped the tears from Ning Yuer's cheeks.

"Madam, I'm sorry for disappearing for two years and making you live so simply. I hope it hasn't been too much of a hardship for you!" Luo Tian smiled and bowed respectfully to Ning's mother.

"There's no need to mention hardship. We've lived through much harder times before, so it's nothing. Moreover, the disciples of the Dan Sect have treated us well. Living here, I feel I can still live for quite some time!" Ning's mother sighed with a smile.

"Ah, after I pay my respects to the senior and the Grand Elder, I'll find a place with more people for you. It's too isolated here in this small courtyard," Luo Tian said, but was pulled into the house by Ning Yuer.

"Luo Tian Senior, sit down. I'll cook dinner and then you can go out again!" Ning Yuer, like a cheerful swallow, rushed outside to busy herself with the meal.

Luo Tian's face softened and he didn't argue with Ning Yuer's words, after all it had been over two years since they last met.

Not long after, the aroma of the meal drifted out. Ning Yuer carried each dish to the table with a triumphant smile, continuously serving Luo Tian while she leaned on her chin and watched him.

Although Luo Tian had long since reached a level where he no longer needed to eat, the rare sense of warmth made him not refuse and he devoured the food with large mouthfuls.

Not long after, Luo Tian had finished two meals and stopped. He then chatted with Ning Yuer for a while, recounting the events of the past two years. However, he omitted the dangerous situations or brushed them aside with a single sentence.

After chatting for two more hours, Luo Tian checked the time and set out towards Zhang Ziping's residence.

It was now daytime. On the main road of the Dan Sect, people were coming and going. Luo Tian walking on the main road quickly caused a commotion.

"Senior Luo, you've returned!"

"Senior Luo has come back!" The disciples of the Dan Sect saw it was Luo Tian and their faces showed great joy. Soon, the news of Luo Tian's return spread throughout the Dan Sect and rapidly moved to each peak with astonishing speed.

Luo Tian saw the enthusiastic disciples of the Dan Sect and smiled gently. He called out, "My fellow disciples, I'll first pay my respects to the Grand Master and the Grand Elder. After that, we can chat in detail!"

Hearing Luo Tian's words, the surrounding disciples of the Dan Sect paused for a moment before returning to their usual state and spoke: "Senior Luo, please go ahead!"

"Return, be sure to find us!" People shouted loudly.

Luo Tian's heart gave a start. That brief moment of silence made him feel some unease, and an ominous premonition arose in his heart.

Thinking this through, Luo Tian said no more words and strode towards Zhang Ziping's residence. The gatekeeper naturally recognized Luo Tian and informed him that the Grand Master had gone to Lu Kunpeng's residence.

Upon hearing the gatekeeper's words, Luo Tian felt even more puzzled. That ominous premonition grew stronger and he unconsciously quickened his pace towards Lu Kunpeng's residence.

As soon as he stepped into the courtyard of Lu Kunpeng, a powerful fluctuation was felt coming from his alchemy room.

Luo Tian couldn't help but extend his spiritual sense into it, and immediately showed a look of great surprise.

"Who..."

A cold voice came out from the alchemy room, and the figures of Zhang Ziping, Lei Yong, and Ji Chen appeared outside the alchemy room instantly.

"Luo Tian!" Seeing it was Luo Tian, the three's faces showed a brief relief before they sighed deeply.

"Luo Tian has returned! Ha ha!" Lu Kunpeng laughed as he stepped out of the alchemy room, his eyes filled with some surprise and he looked at Luo Tian who had just exited the alchemy room.

Chapter 509: Western Region Venom Poison

Chapter 509: Western Region Venom Poison

"Respect the Grand Elder!" Upon seeing Lu Kunpeng step out, Luo Tian's face showed respect and he bowed deeply.

"Good to have you back. Good to have you back! This time, don't run off again. Wait until the Ancient Immortal Ruins open up before going out! Stay in the Dan Sect for now!" Lu Kunpeng smiled, but his eyes showed a touch of sorrow.

Seeing the sorrow in Lu Kunpeng's eyes, Luo Tian felt even more solemn and asked: "What's wrong with the Grand Elder? Is there something wrong with your body?"

"Did you notice it?" Upon hearing Luo Tian's question, Zhang Ziping and the others showed some surprise.

"Indeed!" Luo Tian felt even more solemn within himself, but he was also puzzled. He hadn't sensed any changes in Lu Kunpeng's body at all, and it was definitely the aura of a Nascent Soul Stage I. His blood energy was also vigorous, so he couldn't tell where the illness was.

"The Grand Elder's body has indeed encountered some issues!" Zhang Ziping's face showed a slight smile as he began to recount.

It turned out that when Lu Kunpeng had encountered the strength of the Corpse Sect, he had managed to escape but was poisoned. This poison lay hidden within Lu Kunpeng's body and only erupted after he had ascended to the Nascent Soul Stage, which he discovered.

"Poison?" Luo Tian's brows furrowed slightly, sensing the trouble ahead.

If it were a regular poison, with Grand Elder Lu Kunpeng's alchemy skills at the Seven-Grade Alchemist level, he would have already eliminated it. However, from what they said, there was no way to deal with this poison that even a Seven-Grade Alchemist couldn't handle. Luo Tian could not imagine what kind of poison was so formidable.

"What kind of poison is it? Is there a way to counteract it?" Although Luo Tian had already determined the answer, he still asked.

"It's not a poison from the Northern Region. I suspect this is venom from the Western Region!" Lu Kunpeng's face showed a bitter smile, thinking of his condition.

"Venom from the Western Region?" Luo Tian's face slightly changed. For the entire Tianyuan Continent, the Western Region was like a forbidden land because it was known for cultivating venom and poisons. Few people dared to go there, as if you offended someone, you might die without realizing it, no matter how high your cultivation. Over time, people with low cultivation rarely went to the Western Region, which added more mystery to it.

"Let me check!" Luo Tian's face showed solemnity as he approached Lu Kunpeng and placed his hand on the Grand Elder's wrist, instantly sending a powerful spiritual sense into Lu Kunpeng's body.

However, Luo Tian quickly became disappointed. He found no abnormalities in Lu Kunpeng's body at all.

"Don't bother looking. I know what kind of poison it is!" Lu Kunpeng, sensing the strength of Luo Tian's spiritual sense, showed a look of relief.

"It is symbiotic poison!" Lu Kunpeng spoke softly, his old face showing some bitterness.

Upon hearing Lu Kunpeng's words, Luo Tian's face completely changed and he showed an expression of disbelief.

"Symbiotic... half-life!" Luo Tian hadn't expected that with the Book of Epochs, he knew how dangerous this poison was. His face turned extremely grim.

Symbiotic Poison, also known as Half-Life Poison, meant clearly that after the poison entered the body and formed a symbiotic relationship with the host. However, this poison would continuously devour the host's lifespan and they wouldn't live past half their life. But the host would feel no symptoms at all.

Once the poison had completely devoured the person's lifespan, if it wasn't triggered, the host would be fine. But once the poison's master triggered it, the host would instantly reach their limit and their life would vanish. In other words, Lu Kunpeng's life was no longer in his own hands.

"Corpse Sect! Again the Corpse Sect!" Luo Tian gritted his teeth, eyes filled with endless coldness.

At the same time, Luo Tian's mind continuously searched through the "Book of Epochs" for the chapter on medicinal herbs, a treasure that had never let him down.

Seeing Luo Tian's eyes filled with contemplation, Zhang Ziping and the others showed a brief excitement. They also hoped Luo Tian could find a way, as Lu Kunpeng's position in the Dan Sect was irreplaceable. These four had already exhausted their efforts to find the poison hidden within Lu Kunpeng's body, but they found nothing.

"I've found it!" Luo Tian's face showed great joy and he exclaimed involuntarily.

"What did you find? The solution?" Lei Yong couldn't help but ask excitedly.

"Yes! I think I have a way. However, I need to go to the Ice极 Island in the Southern Region first!" Luo Tian's eyes sparkled with determination, his gaze looking towards the south.

Hearing that Luo Tian was going to Ice极 Island, the four's faces slightly changed. The infamous reputation of Ice极 Island was known throughout the Tianyuan Continent, so how could they not know it?

"No!" Lu Kunpeng loudly responded. He didn't want Luo Tian to take this risk, and he also wasn't too confident that Luo Tian could remove the poison from his body.

"Use the Thousand Mountain Ice Jade to refine the Ice-Extreme Pill, which will freeze the meridians and slow down the poison's activity to reveal its form. Then use the rare fire of the world, the Heavenly Fire, to burn the poison and kill it. This poison can be cured!" Luo Tian spoke softly, recounting the method from the Book of Epochs.

Upon hearing Luo Tian's explanation, the three's eyes paused before showing disappointment. Two treasures were rare and precious items of the world; they weren't easy to find.

"I can find this fire. My master's place, I can borrow it. Although I'm no longer in the Eastern Region's Dan Sect, my master will surely not let me die!" However, Lu Kunpeng spoke softly.

"But this Thousand Mountain Ice Jade is difficult!"

"Did you say it was him?" Luo Tian flicked his finger, and a green flame appeared on his fingertip, floating like a candle.

"Is this not the Green Crystal Luminous Flame? How did it end up in your hands!" Seeing the Green Crystal Luminous Flame, Lu Kunpeng's face showed great surprise. He hadn't expected the Dan Sect to have given it to Luo Tian.

"It's already mine now. So we just need to find the Thousand Mountain Ice Jade!" Luo Tian smiled softly.

"No... going into a place like Ice极 Island, you're just a small Nascent Soul Stage. It's pointless!" Lu Kunpeng spoke out loudly, trying to stop Luo Tian's intention.

"But we four brothers can go together!" Zhang Ziping spoke up. He didn't want Lu Kunpeng to be in danger all the time.

"It's still no good. Ice极 Island is too dangerous. Not only is Ice极 Island itself a perilous place, but even the forces guarding it, the Luo Family, you won't be able to pass!" Lu Kunpeng shook his head.

"The Luo Family? I'll go there eventually. So let's do it early!" Luo Tian's mouth slightly curled up, his eyes showing fierce battle spirit.

Chapter 510: Reunion

Chapter 510: Reunion

Seeing Luo Tian's determined gaze, Lu Kunpeng and the other three couldn't help but smile bitterly. They knew they wouldn't be able to stop Luo Tian again.

"But the first thing is, you must promise your safety. Don't be reckless! You're the one I worry about most!" Lu Kunpeng spoke, his eyes showing concern. Among the four brothers of Luo Tian and Zhang Ziping, he was most concerned about Luo Tian, and the one he didn't trust was also Luo Tian.

Luo Tian's fame in the Northern Region and the Tianyuan Continent had been so great over these years that almost every sect was watching him. Every young person took Luo Tian as their goal, wanting to defeat him. Although the strong inevitably climbed to the peak by stepping on others, Lu Kunpeng felt that Luo Tian's path was much harder than others.

"Rest assured. Ice极 Island, the Luo Family! They are all Luo's!" Luo Tian smiled, but Lu Kunpeng and the others could see the coldness in his eyes.

After discussing further, Luo Tian's three brothers left Lu Kunpeng's residence and each went to their own place.

But when Luo Tian was almost at his door, a group of people blocked him on the main road.

Seeing this group of people, Luo Tian was momentarily stunned and showed a slight smile. There were too many familiar faces among them.

"Luo Tian!" Dong Sansi's voice rang out, his face showing excitement as he stepped forward.

Seeing Dong Sansi, Luo Tian was momentarily stunned. He hadn't expected that Dong Sansi had also ascended to the Nascent Soul Stage. According to Luo Tian's understanding of Dong Sansi, it would take at least two more years for him to reach the Nascent Soul Stage. It seemed that Dong Sansi hadn't been idle these years and had probably encountered some opportunities.

"Good, you've reached the Nascent Soul Stage!" Luo Tian patted Dong Sansi's shoulder and spoke softly.

"That's not it. Now, who in the Northern Region doesn't know of the name 'Moyao Wuhen' (Inkless Blade)? Now, Dong Sansi is the pillar of the Dan Sect's young disciples!" Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu stepped out from among the crowd, their faces also showing smiles.

Both of them were geniuses of each peak. At this moment, they were also emitting the aura of the Nascent Soul Stage. Hearing that Luo Tian had returned, they hurriedly came to the Dan Sect.

Feeling that Luo Tian had also reached the Nascent Soul Stage, they couldn't help but laugh bitterly. Zhang Hongyun spoke: "I thought you were still at the Bone-Formation Peak. I wanted to show off a bit!"

Luo Tian heard Zhang Hongyun's words and smiled, secretly sighing. They should have entered the Nascent Soul Stage before him; otherwise, they wouldn't know that the human tribulation was himself.

Luo Tian didn't say it out loud and gave them a firm punch, his face showing joy: "Come on, I'll treat you all to a big meal!"

They talked and laughed as they walked towards the Moon-Viewing Pavilion on the main peak.

...

At the Water Peak of the Five Elements Sect, a man with an elegant appearance stood calmly, gazing towards the Dan Sect.

"The five-year agreement is finally about to be fulfilled!" Ji Yunhai's gaze was calm, and he vanished from the Water Peak.

At the same time, on the Greenwood Peak, Pei Letian's face showed fierce battle spirit. His gaze was dark and he looked towards the Dan Sect: "Luo Tian, you've finally returned. I've been waiting for this day for a long time!"

Meanwhile, Luo Tian and his group arrived at the Moon-Viewing Pavilion. With Luo Tian, a master alchemist treating them, no one held back and they ate and drank heartily, choosing the most expensive dishes.

"Back already? I guess these young people aren't very well-behaved!" Wei Mingxuan sat on the main peak, his face showing a smile.

"Yucheng, you've always wanted to meet Luo Tian. Do you want to see him?" Wei Mingxuan turned around and looked at a young man standing behind him.

Hearing Wei Mingxuan's words, the youth's body trembled. Jiang Yucheng had made a big splash when the Five Elements Sect recruited disciples two years ago, with his Bone-Formation Peak cultivation and three-element body type. He was considered the second most talented disciple of the Five Elements Sect, after Luo Tian and Zhang Ziping. He was taken in by the sect leader Wei Mingxuan as his disciple.

A battle spirit surged through him. Jiang Yucheng's face showed a hint of anticipation. When he first joined the Five Elements Sect, Luo Tian's name had already become a cliché in his ears. This made the proud Jiang Yucheng feel some resentment.

However, Luo Tian hadn't appeared for two years. As the disciple of the sect leader, he didn't want to be overshadowed by others. So over these two years, Jiang Yucheng had fought against Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu. He even challenged Lei Yong and Ji Chen, but they hadn't reached a conclusion. Jiang Yucheng believed that with two more years of growth, he would definitely surpass them.

"Go see for yourself!" Wei Mingxuan saw his disciple's thoughts and shook his head slightly.

"Yes..." Jiang Yucheng bowed respectfully and vanished from the spot.

"Maybe he needs to face some setbacks. These two years, Yucheng has become overconfident!" Wei Mingxuan watched his disciple's distant figure and shook his head slightly.

"Luo Tian, I'll tell you, in these two years our Five Elements Sect has produced many talents. Not only have we had people enter the Nascent Soul Stage, but even those two years younger than us have entered it. The sect leader took in a three-element body disciple, who was extremely arrogant. He had quite the same spirit as you back then!" Zhang Hongyun poured a mouthful of wine into his mouth and sighed.

Hearing Zhang Hongyun's sigh, the disciples of the Dan Sect showed a look of disdain. When Luo Tian was around, how strong he had been, suppressing the disciples from each peak so they couldn't lift their heads. Now Jiang Yucheng had some strength, but in the eyes of the Dan Sect disciples, he was far from being comparable to Luo Tian back then.

"Jiang Yucheng?" Hearing the people's discussion, Dong Sansi's brows slightly furrowed.

"What? You have a grudge with him?" Luo Tian noticed Dong Sansi's slightly furrowed brows and asked softly.

"More than a grudge. In the Five Elements Sect, who doesn't have a grudge with this kid? As soon as he reached the Nascent Soul Stage, he challenged everywhere. He acted like he was the top of the world. Back then, I didn't even beat him!" Zhang Hongyun's face showed disdain.

"Stop boasting. It was a draw. If he had two more years of growth, we might really not be his match!" Feng Qianyu bluntly exposed Zhang Hongyun's words.

"I'm not his match!" Dong Sansi's face turned grim, showing a hint of regret. He had once fought against Jiang Yucheng in the Dan Sect and lost, but it was Lei Yong who finally subdued Jiang Yucheng. Thinking back to that moment, Dong Sansi felt uncomfortable.

Hearing the discussion, Luo Tian didn't pay it any mind. Now, his standards were not ordinary. He could easily crush an Nascent Soul Stage Midpoint, and even if it was a Nascent Soul Stage Late, he had no fear. He could maneuver with a Nascent Soul Stage Peak. For an Nascent Soul Stage Early, he really had no fear.

Chapter 511: Fulfilling the Agreement from Before

Chapter 511: Fulfilling the Agreement from Before

"Don't worry, if he comes looking for you, I'll help you regain your dignity!" Luo Tian patted Dong Sansi's shoulder and comforted him.

"Ha ha, these young people are too arrogant. They need to be taught a lesson!" Zhang Hongyun and the others laughed, continuing to talk about other things.

After eating for nearly an hour, they gradually left. Some people had their own matters to attend to. Finally, only Feng Qianyu and Zhang Hui and a few disciples of the Dan Sect remained.

The Moon-Viewing Pavilion returned to peace. Luo Tian and others sat at a table, chatting.

At this moment, a young man walked up from downstairs. His body radiated a powerful aura. With his youthful face and a long sword on his back, the group's attention was drawn to him.

"Jiang Yucheng! I didn't expect you to be the first one here!" Seeing the person, Zhang Hongyun spoke with a look of disdain.

Luo Tian's return would surely cause quite a stir in the Five Elements Sect. Those disciples who had some issues with Luo Tian would come, but they hadn't expected that the first one to arrive was Jiang Yucheng.

Jiang Yucheng's face showed battle spirit as he surveyed Luo Tian. This man, who was spoken of so highly in the Five Elements Sect, had actually arrived. But he found it too crowded and waited until the crowd dispersed before entering.

But when Jiang Yucheng saw Luo Tian, his heart was shaken. Because the person before him was too familiar. His third tribulation during the human tribulation, the third one being the human tribulation, was this man with a calm expression.

Jiang Yucheng still remembered how he had struggled during his tribulation. If it weren't for the human tribulation not allowing weapons, he might have failed.

Thinking of this, Jiang Yucheng's eyes sparkled with intensity and he looked at Luo Tian with a burning gaze.

While Jiang Yucheng was surveying Luo Tian, Luo Tian also surveyed Jiang Yucheng. He nodded in his heart and sighed inwardly. This Jiang Yucheng looked younger than himself by one or two years, but had already reached the Nascent Soul Stage. It seemed that there are always people better than oneself.

Luo Tian had previously thought he was the youngest Nascent Soul Stage in the Tianyuan Continent. Now, seeing Jiang Yucheng, he realized he was wrong. There were younger ones than himself, but he had just never met them.

"Luo Senior, I've seen you before!" Jiang Yucheng's face showed a slight smile as he spoke softly.

"Ha ha, many people have seen me. Many also hate me with clenched teeth!" Luo Tian rubbed his nose and showed an awkward smile.

Hearing the two's conversation, Zhang Hongyun and others were momentarily stunned, not understanding what they were talking about.

"What are the two of you saying? I don't understand!" Zhang Hongyun asked, voicing the confusion in their hearts.

"It's nothing. I believe that when more people enter the Nascent Soul Stage, you'll understand!" Luo Tian patted Zhang Hongyun's shoulder and smiled.

"Luo Senior, may I challenge you?" As the two were talking, a clear voice rang out from outside the Moon-Viewing Pavilion.

"Shui Yuqing?" Hearing the voice, Jiang Yucheng's brows slightly furrowed and he recognized the speaker.

"Ha ha, these young people are so arrogant. Don't they know about respecting elders and being kind to the young?" Zhang Hongyun laughed loudly.

Shui Yuqing, who had entered the Five Elements Sect with Jiang Yucheng, was also a prodigy. However, Shui Yuqing had entered the Five Elements Sect at the Bone-Formation Peak Initial Stage. Now, he was at the Bone-Formation Peak Apex and was much weaker than Jiang Yucheng. However, no one dared to underestimate Shui Yuqing. This person had average talent but extraordinary perseverance. Sometimes even Feng Qianyu saw this kid and felt admiration. Moreover, he had a bigger advantage than others: his age. He was only sixteen years old today.

After the voice fell, Shui Yuqing's figure appeared in people's sight. Luo Tian looked at him and showed a look of surprise.

Young, that was the first impression of Luo Tian. His face hadn't fully grown out of its childishness.

"What's going on with this era?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly, feeling some confusion. He had thought that their generation was already the peak of prodigies, but he hadn't expected that the next generation would be so similar.

"Prosperity must lead to decline!" Luo Tian's brows furrowed tightly, a bad premonition forming in his heart. He felt that something big was about to happen, not just in the Northern Region but even across the entire Tianyuan Continent.

"Luo Tian, Senior. May I challenge you?" Shui Yuqing spoke loudly, his eyes showing a hint of hatred.

"Looking for death!" Zhang Hongyun and others saw the unmistakable killing intent in Shui Yuqing's eyes and couldn't help but shout at him.

Jiang Yucheng also furrowed his brows slightly. Although he too wanted to challenge Luo Tian, he had no killing intent; it was simply a desire to defeat Luo Tian. However, Shui Yuqing was different. He had intense killing intent. Killing intent differed from battle spirit and it was easy to distinguish.

Everyone didn't understand what Shui Yuqing had against Luo Tian, making this sixteen-year-old boy show such a strong killing intent. Even though he knew he wasn't a match, he still challenged.

"You've offended me before?" Luo Tian smiled.

"You're too high and mighty to remember. I suppose you've forgotten, but my entire family was slaughtered by you. But I haven't forgotten. You, dare to fight?" Shui Yuqing roared and a blue-green spear appeared in his hand.

Luo Tian's brows slightly furrowed. He truly couldn't figure out where he had offended Shui Yuqing, and even more so, that he had slaughtered his entire family.

However, Luo Tian quickly felt a surge of killing intent. Being constantly targeted by such a young prodigy was definitely not good. If he found someone connected to himself, they might also be affected.

"Ha ha, rest assured. I Shui Yuqing am open and honest. I don't go looking for trouble with others, otherwise the mother and daughter of Ning would not be alive now!" It seemed he saw Luo Tian's look of concern, and Shui Yuqing loudly mocked.

"Huh?" Hearing Shui Yuqing's words, everyone looked at him in surprise.

"Okay, I accept your challenge!" Luo Tian sighed deeply.

Jiang Yucheng's face showed an unhappy expression. After all, he had come first, but was disturbed by a disciple at the Bone-Formation Peak. His gaze towards Shui Yuqing showed hostility.

"You can come too! Don't think I'm bullying you!" Luo Tian smiled and spoke to Jiang Yucheng, who had furrowed brows.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, the others were momentarily surprised before understanding. Shui Yuqing was at the Bone-Formation Peak Apex, and for Luo Tian's Nascent Soul Stage, he was almost harmless.

Jiang Yucheng's face showed a hint of joy and he bowed respectfully to Luo Tian, saying: "Senior please..."

Chapter 512: One Against Four

Chapter 512: One Against Four

At the Five Elements Sect's training ground.

After Luo Tian and Jiang Yucheng's group left the Moon-Viewing Pavilion, they walked to the training ground.

At this moment, Luo Tian's face showed a smile as he looked at the two young men before him. He thought of himself years ago, thinking he had been quite arrogant standing there to accept challenges from disciples of other peaks.

But at that time, he had only fought on equal terms. He hadn't gone looking for trouble with his seniors. Now these two had come to challenge him, who had been in the sect for years longer.

"Really looking for trouble. They dare to challenge Senior Luo!" Some disciples who had entered the sect earlier showed disdain and laughed.

"Ah... the younger generation pushes out the older one! Have you seen Jiang Senior's strength?" On the other hand, some young disciples who supported Jiang Yucheng showed a defiant look.

"年轻人, you don't know. Senior Luo's strength!" Some older disciples patted the young people on their shoulders and sighed, then looked at Luo Tian with a burning gaze.

"Senior please!" With his long sword in hand, Jiang Yucheng bowed and spoke.

"Wait a moment..." Luo Tian's face was calm, smiling as he looked at the training ground outside.

"Are you afraid of fighting?" Hearing Luo Tian's words, young disciples showed mockery.

"Kid, say that again. Do you think I'll break your legs?" Older disciples shouted loudly, their eyes dark.

Luo Tian's insult made them feel uncomfortable. Especially seeing the faces of these young disciples, they felt even more anger.

Two groups: one representing older disciples and the other new disciples. They didn't want to yield to each other, arguing loudly.

Hearing both sides' arguments, Zhang Hongyun and others furrowed their brows in confusion, looking at Luo Tian.

"Senior still needs to prepare?" Jiang Yucheng spoke up, his energy surging and obviously not wanting to wait any longer.

"年轻人, you need patience. It's coming soon. They're here!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his gaze deep as he looked towards the distance.

Luo Tian's words had just finished when a sound of breaking through the sky echoed. Two figures flashed like lightning and appeared in the air above the training ground.

A golden and green pair of wings shone brightly in the sky. Pei Letian's figure appeared in the sky, his powerful aura making people on the ground feel short of breath.

On the other side, a blue energy wing trembled slightly. A humid atmosphere spread across the square, and Ji Yunhai's face showed a smile as he looked at Luo Tian standing there. His whole body seemed like a cloud.

"About time, they've all arrived!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly.

"Did you come to find trouble for me?" Luo Tian shouted at the two in the sky.

"Luo Tian, today I Pei Letian will definitely avenge the humiliation you gave me!" Pei Letian's eyes were filled with battle spirit. His aura of Nascent Soul Stage Midpoint surged and pressed towards Luo Tian, his body slowly landing in front of him.

"Remember the agreement from a few years ago? A fight at Bone-Formation Stage, now it seems unnecessary. We're both in the Nascent Soul Stage!" Ji Yunhai's gaze was calm as he looked at Luo Tian and also landed.

"Waiting for you. Now everyone is here, fight together! It'll save us time!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his gaze showing indifference.

"What?"

"Too bold! This is our Senior Luo!" The crowd roared with excitement.

"Arrogant..." At this moment, everyone's hearts echoed with that word. Facing four opponents, and two of them were Nascent Soul Stage Midpoint, one was Nascent Soul Stage Early. People didn't know where Luo Tian got his confidence.

Even Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu felt their brows tighten, eyes filled with strong shock.

Luo Tian was very strong, this Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu admitted. But facing two Nascent Soul Stage Midpoint alone, it was impossible in their view.

Dong Sansi's eyes flashed with intense light. His gaze filled with admiration for Luo Tian, his heart excited: "Indeed unchanged, still so confident!"

However, the faces of the other four were completely darkened. Especially Ji Yunhai who had previously shown a smile, was now as dark as a storm cloud after Luo Tian's words.

"I can handle it alone!" Pei Letian's face showed a fierce expression. He roared and immediately attacked, his dual-element energy surged out. His body moved like lightning and in the next moment was before Luo Tian, a punch shot out.

"Go back!" Luo Tian smiled slightly and punched as well. Seven-color energy wrapped his fist, meeting Pei Letian's punch.

"Boom..." A deafening sound echoed as the two fists collided. An invisible barrier rose in people's eyes, enclosing Luo Tian and others within it.

Although they were enclosed by the barrier, people still felt the deafening sound. Some disciples of the cultivation body stage instinctively covered their ears.

"This is a Nascent Soul Stage battle. We can't even withstand one of their punches!" The crowd whispered, constantly discussing.

"Step by step..." After the explosion, Pei Letian took several steps back, his face showing disbelief.

"Ha ha..." Luo Tian laughed loudly and didn't care about Pei Letian's retreat. He took a step with the Boundless Steps and instantly appeared before Ji Yunhai, punching as well. His other hand formed a seal, the Five Elements King Seal instantly cast towards Jiang Yucheng.

"Really one against three!" People's faces showed disbelief as they looked at Luo Tian appearing before the three, their faces showing amazement.

As for Shui Yuqing, he had already been forgotten by everyone. A disciple at the Bone-Formation Peak Apex, although stronger than others, could be easily killed by any one of the three within the barrier.

Shui Yuqing didn't rush. He simply stood in a corner, watching the battle. The fluctuations of the three were strong but didn't affect Shui Yuqing at all.

Jiang Yucheng and the others were extremely frustrated. When fighting one-on-one, Luo Tian would immediately retreat after a single strike and move to another person. They didn't get any chance to fight Luo Tian alone. Three against one, the three's pride wouldn't allow them to do this, but Luo Tian skillfully brought both others into the battle.

At first, the three were hesitant. But later, they were enraged by Luo Tian's actions and didn't care about their pride anymore. Their faces darkened as they attacked Luo Tian.

"Boom..." The sound of the battle filled the entire barrier, obscuring people's vision.

Chapter 513: There's Still Me

Chapter 513: There's Still Me

People were amazed. The four of them moved so fast that even without the smoke, disciples of the cultivation body stage and Bone-Formation Stage couldn't see their fight.

"Unexpectedly, after two years without seeing you, Luo Tian has become so strong!" Zhang Hongyun's face showed a look of admiration.

Among the crowd watching, only a few could see the four figures. Zhang Hongyun and others were among them.

Hearing Zhang Hongyun's words, Feng Qianyu also showed a look of admiration. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to have made such progress in just two years, especially after seeing that Luo Tian had become a seven-element body type.

The four's spiritual senses showed that Luo Tian, facing three Nascent Soul Stage masters, was not at a disadvantage. His martial arts were frequent and his form was only slightly battered.

"Life-Destroying Finger!"

"Water Cloud Sealing Heaven!"

"Three Divine Seals!" Finally, the three couldn't withstand the life-destroying power and used their martial arts.
