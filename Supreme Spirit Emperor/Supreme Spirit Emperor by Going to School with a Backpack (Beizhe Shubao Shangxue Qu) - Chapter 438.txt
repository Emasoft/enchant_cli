“Divine energy! Where the hell am I supposed to get divine energy from!” Luo Tian felt his Star-Stepping Technique had become a hindrance. At that moment, he already possessed a single thread of divine energy within his body—insufficient to sustain even a single martial technique.

“If I had so much divine energy, why would I bother learning this damned Star-Stepping Technique? I could just unleash all of it and become invincible!” Luo Tian muttered, but he still memorized the technique’s flow before beginning to recover from his injuries.

Time flowed slowly. Seven days passed in the blink of an eye, and Luo Tian’s wounds began to heal. He slowly rose to his feet, gazing at the massive door left behind after he had slain eighteen goat-faced elders on the altar. A faint smile crossed his face.

“The extra three layers have finally been cleared. I wonder how those people are faring in the next trial,” Luo Tian murmured, stepping through the door while silently praying that his companions had not encountered any trouble.

“Hum…” A familiar vibration resonated, and the next moment, the ground beneath Luo Tian solidified. A desolate atmosphere filled his perception.

The entire world was dim and gloomy, with withered grasses sprawling across crimson earth riddled with cracks. A cruel aura permeated the air.

“Welcome to the Crimson Battlefield!” a deep voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, causing his thoughts to pause. Based on the experiences of the previous three trials, he knew this voice was the master of this level.

“This place is far crueler than the first three trials. The losers are expelled from Star River Sect, and each person has only one chance to die—after which they may choose rebirth or departure,” the voice continued. “But only one death is allowed. If you choose rebirth and die again, it means true death.”

“Collect ten Star River Tokens to qualify for the outer sect disciples’ trial. Collect a hundred tokens to enter the three inner sect disciples’ trials held by Star River Sect. There are no other rules here—only brutal combat and slaughter!” The cold voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears, causing his eyes to narrow.

“This level is the true test. To enter Star River Sect, one must kill. Only by passing this trial can one be deemed worthy of entering Star River Sect!” The voice spoke again, prompting a faint smile on Luo Tian’s face.

“Newcomers have arrived. The trial time is extended by seven days!” The voice echoed across the entire world, not just reaching Luo Tian but every inhabitant of this miniature realm.

“Someone has entered? Who is it?” A group of people in a withered forest exchanged puzzled glances.

“Regardless, our goal is to leave after dying. Don’t be reckless!” A lecherous voice spoke. If Luo Tian had heard it, he would have recognized it immediately—Zhang Xin’s voice.

“Right. Let them fight! Star River Sect is a heavenly affair. Whether we can ascend to immortality remains uncertain. What’s the point of competing?” A thunderous voice echoed.

“Enough talk. The priority is to regroup with others! Those from the Celestial Realms Alliance aren’t easy to deal with,” a man in purple robes, Biao Deju, said. He then sniffed the air.

“This place is truly desolate. My senses are suppressed too much!” Biao Deju’s eyes flashed with anger as he addressed Zhang Xin and the others.

“Terrible place. If I had known there were no benefits, I wouldn’t have come. It would’ve been better to refine divine energy outside Star River Sect!” Sun Keliang’s eyes gleamed with greed, his gaze fixed on the endless withered forest.

“Then we’ll send you out!” Sun Keliang’s words had barely finished when a cold voice echoed in their ears, causing their faces to stiffen instantly.

“Hum…” A gust of wind surged as figures appeared before them, forcing the group to huddle together.

“Kill…” A golden-robed youth smiled as he gazed at Zhang Xin and the others before charging forward without hesitation.

“Sun Yuhang, Nan Gong Wu Bei! What the hell is this!” Seeing them, Zhang Xin and others cursed before rushing toward Sun Yuhang’s group.

The sound of battle erupted in the withered forest, and two groups clashed instantly.

……

On another front, Luo Tian wandered across the crimson earth without purpose—after all, he had no map of this world.

“The rules here are suppressed. I can’t fly,” Luo Tian mused, stepping into a dilapidated building complex.

The entire structure was in ruins, yet Luo Tian sensed powerful fluctuations within it. These were not from the Nine Realms. Though dilapidated, he felt that breaking through would require considerable effort.

“Boom…” A thunderous sound echoed as fluctuations emerged in Luo Tian’s perception, causing his brows to furrow.

“Someone is fighting?” He quickly deduced the source of the fluctuations, a hint of excitement on his face. Since entering Star River Sect, he had yet to meet another living soul. Any combat now was both intriguing and a chance to learn about this fourth trial.

With that, Luo Tian dashed toward the battle’s direction. Though unable to fly, his speed was remarkable, reaching the battlefield in under an hour.

Three figures appeared in Luo Tian’s vision—his three wives. His face lit up with joy, but it quickly turned into cold hostility.

Their white robes were pristine. Each held a golden long sword, clashing against a gaunt middle-aged man.

The man was immensely powerful, fending off three opponents. These were none other than Luo Tian’s three wives.

“Haha, I never expected to meet another soul in this Star River Sect trial after so many years. And he’s so weak!” The man’s eyes gleamed with excitement, his gray long sword slicing relentlessly, pressing the three women.

“Don’t worry. I won’t kill you. After so many years here, I’ve finally met such exquisite beauties. I’ll enjoy them thoroughly!” A voice filled with greed echoed, causing Luo Tian’s eyes to grow colder.

“Kill…” Without hesitation, Luo Tian pushed off the ground, his golden crackling spear in hand. He transformed into a gust of wind, charging toward the man.

Chapter 1710: The Previous Trial Participants

“Hum…” Luo Tian’s arrival stunned all four combatants. Sun Mengru and the others smiled with joy, momentarily forgetting their fight. They recognized this figure instantly—Luo Tian’s presence was unexpected.

“Luo Tian!” Leng Qiuchan whispered, her face breaking into a smile despite the frost. Sun Mengru and Jiang Sisi also showed excitement, their smiles causing the man’s eyes to gleam.

“Hum…” The golden spear shot toward the man, who quickly regained his composure.

“Who are you?” The man’s long sword blocked the spear, slicing toward it.

“Crush…” The spear tip collided with the blade precisely. The gray sword began to crack under the spear’s sharp aura, causing the man’s face to pale.

“His husband!” Luo Tian coldly replied. Though he didn’t know the man’s identity, he was already on his kill list. This man felt extremely formidable.

“Perfect! Killing you gives me five Star River Tokens!” The man’s eyes narrowed, stepping back and gazing at Luo Tian. His gray long sword was discarded onto the ground.

“Be careful. He’s one of the previous trial participants. This level didn’t let him pass, so he chose to stay behind,” Sun Mengru and the others warned Luo Tian.

“Previous trial participants? So he’s from heaven?” Hearing their words, Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed slightly. He tightened his grip on the crackling spear, eyeing the man cautiously.

“After waiting so long, I’ve finally met you. This is my chance to enter Star River Sect. I’ve waited for this day!” The man smiled, then a golden long sword materialized in his hand. A powerful aura radiated from it.

“Divine energy!” Luo Tian’s face changed abruptly, sensing a massive threat on the golden sword.

“Haha. Fight! Remember—killing you is Sang Tianliang!” The man spoke, then slashed downward with his golden sword. A golden blade of light, radiating overwhelming power, descended toward Luo Tian.

“Hum…” Luo Tian stepped forward, the crackling spear emitting divine light. He raised it above his head to clash with the golden blade.

“Crack…” The sound of collision echoed. Luo Tian took a few steps back, his face showing concern.

“Though the sword contains divine energy, it’s not much,” he thought as he exhaled deeply.

“This Sang Tianliang is clearly a low-level figure in heaven. If he had reached the Daoist Realm, we could’ve committed suicide!” Luo Tian thought to himself, his eyes filled with battle intent.

Heaven was a mysterious and powerful realm in the minds of Luo Tian and all Nine Realms. Though this Sang Tianliang was strong, it revealed that heaven wasn’t entirely filled with powerful beings—there were also weak ones.

“An ant in heaven, failed to pass Star River Sect’s trial. Living here for so long—how dare he kill me?” Luo Tian coldly spoke, then rushed toward Sang Tianliang again.

“You dare to provoke me!” The man’s face turned sinister. Luo Tian’s words had struck a nerve.

Without reaching the Daoist Realm, one was at the lowest level in heaven. Sang Tianliang had also been a low-level participant in Star River Sect’s trial. If he had any talent, he wouldn’t have spent so many years lingering here.

People like Sang Tianliang were also present in the crimson battlefield. They knew they had no chance against their peers, so they chose to stay behind for the next trial. This increased their chances.

“Crack…” The golden spear clashed with the golden sword again. Luo Tian took a step back, sighing inwardly. Though Sang Tianliang was low-level in heaven, he was a strong opponent here. After years of waiting, this was his moment.

Sang Tianliang also took a step back, his eyes filled with caution. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be so strong.

“Kid, you’re strong. You must be a disciple of a powerful sect!” Sang Tianliang spoke coldly, unaware that Star River Sect had moved to the Nine Realms.

“Blade of Heaven’s Might!” Sang Tianliang roared, his golden sword radiating immense light. A thread of divine power surged from it, causing Luo Tian and the three women to frown.

“Spear of Heaven’s Sky!” Luo Tian didn’t hesitate. He and his spear merged into a streak of light, vanishing from the spot.

A resplendent blade of light rose in the crimson sky. It looked like a crescent moon, slicing toward Luo Tian and the three women.

Luo Tian and his spear became a streak of light, rushing toward the crescent moon. It seemed to tear through everything.

“Sword Through the Void!” Sun Mengru, Leng Qiuchan, and Jiang Sisi couldn’t let Luo Tian fight Sang Tianliang alone. Their swords unleashed three powerful martial arts, striking toward Sang Tianliang.

Sun Mengru and the others had reached the level of a Semi-Daoist Master. Their attacks were formidable, forcing Sang Tianliang to be cautious. A golden light formed a barrier around him, inscribed with runes that protected him.

“Crack…” The golden streak collided with the golden blade, shattering the seemingly invincible blade. At the same time, Sun Mengru’s attack pierced through the barrier.

“Crack… Crack…” The sound of breaking echoed. Leng Qiuchan and Jiang Sisi’s sword light shattered the barrier, while Sun Mengru’s Qingfeng (Blue Wind) sword pierced through the broken barrier toward Sang Tianliang.

A crisis arose. Sang Tianliang, facing Sun Mengru’s attack, showed intense fear. In a split second, he dodged his vital points.

“Puff…” The cold sword light pierced Sang Tianliang’s shoulder, causing his face to pale.

“Now, are you still going to kill us?” A cold voice echoed behind Sang Tianliang. A golden fist, radiating immense power, struck toward him.

“Damn it!” Sang Tianliang’s face darkened. He turned abruptly and punched toward the golden fist, colliding with it.

“Boom…” The two figures retreated, colliding against a dilapidated building. Both Luo Tian and Sang Tianliang showed surprise.

“Luo Tian managed to get close—unscathed!” Sun Mengru and the others were surprised. They hadn’t expected to touch someone who could fight Luo Tian.

“You’re not from heaven!” Sang Tianliang was shocked. He was a low-level figure in heaven, his body not strong. This punch had only pushed him back slightly. If it were another from heaven, he would’ve suffered some injuries.

“You just realized?” Luo Tian coldly replied. Though he admired the man’s strong body, thinking of his origin in heaven—nourished by its environment—he could accept it.

“Three Thousand Small Realms!” Sang Tianliang sensed, his eyes flashing with light. “Haha! I never expected Star River Sect to have moved into the Three Thousand Small Realms. This is truly heaven’s blessing!”

“You’re top-tier strength in these small realms!” Sang Tianliang was overjoyed, gazing at Luo Tian and the others.

“How many people wanted to enter these small realms but failed? I’ve easily entered. In this realm, who would be my opponent? I’ll have everything I desire!” Sang Tianliang trembled with excitement, imagining his dominance over the small realms.

“Kid, let’s negotiate. We’ll team up to kill others and gain inner sect disciples’ qualifications. Then we can leave Star River Sect. Afterward, your entire small realm will be ours!”

“Of course, you’ll give me one of your women! I’ll help you become the ultimate power in this realm!” Sang Tianliang proposed, his voice laced with temptation.

“A very reasonable suggestion. But I don’t need it!” Luo Tian refused immediately. He wouldn’t accept such a deal.

“Then you’re seeking death! Your bodies lack divine energy. Killing me is like dreaming!” Sang Tianliang’s face turned cold as he saw Luo Tian still attacking.

The hum of energy echoed. A world-destroying aura emerged from Sang Tianliang’s hands, sweeping across the area and causing Luo Tian to change his expression.

“Do you see? This is divine energy. If I strike, you’ll die for sure. Consider my proposal again. This is your last chance!” Sang Tianliang threatened, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian.

Chapter 1711: Killing

A world-destroying aura coalesced in Sang Tianliang’s hands. He gazed at Luo Tian and the others with mockery, as if looking down on a rustic villager. His eyes held arrogance—after all, in their view, Luo Tian and others from small realms had never seen divine energy.

“Powerful. Unfortunately, it’s already been refined!” Luo Tian stood before Sun Mengru and the others, his face grim as he observed Sang Tianliang’s aura. He muttered to himself.

“Kid, how are you doing? If you want to continue, we can team up. We’ll eliminate all your enemies here. The rewards for outer sect disciples are rich, and inner sect disciples are even better—resources enough to reach the Daoist Realm. The Daoist Realm is the strongest in your realm!”

“I don’t need it. I’m not from your world, so I’m not bound by its rules. Once I reach the Daoist Realm, I’ll naturally ascend back to heaven!” Sang Tianliang continued.

“Don’t need it,” Luo Tian’s face turned cold. He summoned the Daoist Thunder Sword, pouring his epoch power into it.

“This!” Sang Tianliang’s face changed. Though he was a low-level figure in heaven, his eyes were sharp enough to recognize the Daoist Thunder Sword’s three-color lightning. His eyes flashed with greed.

“A divine artifact! Though it’s broken, repairing it would make it a lower-tier divine weapon!” Sang Tianliang exclaimed.

“I never expected such an artifact in the Three Thousand Small Realms!”

“Kid, I can change my conditions. Give me this sword, and I’ll still cooperate with you!” Sang Tianliang spoke again, sensing a strong threat from the Daoist Thunder Sword.

“I’ll give it to you—just fear to take it!” Luo Tian inwardly sneered. If Sang Tianliang knew this artifact was the Zenith Treasure of the Daoist Sect, he’d be too scared to accept it.

“Since you’re ungrateful, I’ll grant your wish! Let you see how terrifying power beyond your world is!” Sang Tianliang coldly spoke. Luo Tian had exceeded his tolerance.

“Hum…” At the same time, Sang Tianliang moved his hands, sending waves of energy into the world-destroying aura.

Golden light flashed. Under Sang Tianliang’s full power, the world-destroying aura evolved into a golden small knife, slicing toward Luo Tian.

“Boom…” The thunderous sound echoed. The golden knife destroyed the dilapidated buildings it passed, collapsing one after another.

“Get behind!” Luo Tian’s forehead sweat. He watched the small knife, just over a foot long, and bit his teeth to summon Sun Mengru and the others. He didn’t want them harmed.

“Divine energy? Fortunately, I have some!” Luo Tian’s eyes turned ruthless. Facing the small knife made of divine energy, he couldn’t be careless. If it struck him, he’d be destroyed without a chance to regenerate.

“Hum…” Thinking this, Luo Tian also condensed the divine energy within his body into the Daoist Thunder Sword.

“Crack…” Lightning surged. The world-destroying aura erupted from the Daoist Thunder Sword.

“Sword Through Heaven!” Luo Tian whispered, his epoch power drained completely. However, with the divine energy added, he avoided losing life and years. Combined with the Daoist Thunder Sword’s evolution, Luo Tian could unleash his strongest strike.

“Hum…” The three-color lightning roared on the Daoist Thunder Sword, then coalesced in Luo Tian’s vision.

Same world-destroying power. Even more astonishing than Sang Tianliang’s small knife. After all, this was the technique of the Fallen Heaven Immortal King—once one of the Nine Heavenly Kings in heaven. Compared to Sang Tianliang, he was ten thousand times stronger.

Luo Tian’s full-power “Sword Through Heaven” was weaker than the Fallen Heaven Immortal King’s, but in Star River Sect, it could sweep all.

“Buddha Heaven Attack!” Luo Tian’s face was pale but his hands still moved, burning his blood to unleash the Buddha Heaven Attack. It enhanced the world-destroying sword light.

Though the Buddha Heaven Attack could increase attack power fivefold, it was still discounted against the “Sword Through Heaven.” It only added a little. But this little was enough to kill Sang Tianliang.

“Boom…” The three-color sword light collided with the golden knife, thundering. Invisible waves swept outward.

“Damn it!” When Luo Tian condensed the sword light, Sang Tianliang’s face changed wildly. He felt a life-threatening danger in the three-color sword light, as if it dominated all beings.

In an instant, Sang Tianliang’s golden knife was shattered by the three-color sword light. It scattered into divine laws, flowing outward.

“Puff…” Sang Tianliang spat out old blood. His eyes showed terror, gazing at the three-color lightning sword light approaching him.

The golden crackling spear and Daoist Thunder Sword hovered above Luo Tian, forming a barrier to protect him.

“Are you dead or not?” Luo Tian stood under the barrier, allowing the invisible waves to sweep over it. His vast spiritual awareness controlled the three-color sword light toward Sang Tianliang.

“Get out!” Sang Tianliang’s face showed madness. He unleashed all his strength into a barrier before him, blocking the divine laws and fleeing.

“Want to run? If you escape, I’ll reverse my name!” Luo Tian mocked as he watched Sang Tianliang’s desperate flight. His spiritual awareness consumed fiercely, controlling the sword light to chase after him.

“Ah… kid, are you really going to finish me off? I’ll submit to you! Make that damned thing stop!” Sang Tianliang ran frantically, his body like a whirlwind. He roared at Luo Tian, regret deep in his heart. How could he have expected such a monster from a small realm?

“Sang Tianliang, despicable. Your name alone isn’t good. Want me to let you go? If I were in your position, would you let me live?” Luo Tian coldly replied. He was surprised by Sang Tianliang’s speed—each time the sword light nearly pierced him, he could accelerate further.

“Kid, don’t make me your enemy. I’ll let you suffer endlessly!” Sang Tianliang switched to a hardline after soft methods failed.

“Unfortunately, you have no chance!” Luo Tian’s face showed impatience. He waved his hand, and a gray soul knife appeared, slicing into his spiritual core. A powerful spiritual essence flew out of his body and rushed into the three-color sword light.

“Hum…” With Luo Tian’s spiritual essence added, the three-color sword light increased speed. It pierced through the barrier that had nearly torn apart.

“Puff…” The next moment, Sang Tianliang’s body stopped abruptly. His face showed disbelief as blood flowed from his mouth. He stared at the three-color sword light piercing through his back and exiting his front.

“Crack…” Three-color lightning surged across Sang Tianliang’s body. The ultimate refining power caused him to howl in pain, but he only managed one scream before his body turned into a wisp of ashes. Not even blood remained, scattered on the ground.

“Huff…” Luo Tian sighed deeply, watching the aftermath of their battle. His surroundings had turned into a vacuum. He smiled slightly and released Sun Mengru and the others.

“Luo Tian!” Sun Mengru, Leng Qiuchan, and Jiang Sisi saw Luo Tian’s pale face. Their faces showed concern.

“Nothing serious. Just a bit drained,” Luo Tian shook his head, speaking to them. He then gazed at the three women.

“How are you? Why are you here? Where are the others?” Luo Tian took out a pill, swallowed it, and asked them while regaining his strength.

“We’re fine. We were directly transported here. Others from our regions and the Celestial Realms Alliance also entered,” Jiang Sisi spoke softly, recounting the events.

“After entering, we all scattered. I met Leng Qiuchan and Sun Mengru just now,” Jiang Sisi said, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Tell me who else came,” Luo Tian frowned again. He felt this Star River Sect journey was not simple. Not only were there hidden enemies, but the heavenly beings lingering in the crimson battlefield weren’t easy to deal with.

Though they were nothing in heaven, they were top-tier power in the Nine Realms. Take Sang Tianliang as an example—outside Star River Sect, with his divine energy, he could easily crush a sect.

Moreover, Luo Tian wasn’t sure if Sang Tianliang was the strongest among those who stayed. There was also the hidden soul-attacher, who hadn’t shown up yet—another major enemy.

“From our Four Sacred Realms, besides Jiang Nanxuan, the troublemakers at home came too. They had nothing to do and all arrived,” Sun Mengru smiled, speaking to Luo Tian.

“From the Divine Race: Sun Feiwen. From the Demon Race: Nan Gong Yuqing. From the Chaos Domain: Zhu Ge Huangchao and Zhu Ge Qingtian. From the Reincarnation Domain: Yan Hongtao, Run Hongyu, Long Jie, and Biao Deju. Of course, Yao Chen must have followed too!”

“As for the Fire Domain, your sister Du Yuying and her husband also came,” Sun Mengru, Leng Qiuchan, and Jiang Sisi recited a long list of names. Luo Tian felt his head spin.

“Of course, there are also the Zhou family from Star Realm. As for the Celestial Realms Alliance side, we only know Nan Gong Wu Bei and Sun Yuhang. As for others, we don’t know. Oh, I heard there were many Epoch Masters’ offspring too. But they didn’t come with us!” Jiang Sisi added, her voice filled with concern.

“That’s good. I think those Epoch Masters’ offspring would be beneficial for us!” Luo Tian nodded, his eyes filled with admiration. He never expected Star River Sect to attract so many people.

But he soon relaxed, as Star River Sect was related to heaven. These Epoch Masters’ offspring all wished to become immortal and follow their fathers’ footsteps.

“Not necessarily. I remember some Epoch Masters’ offspring also had hostility toward you. I heard a woman was very hostile toward you!” Sun Mengru’s eyes flashed with danger, gazing at Luo Tian. His face changed immediately.

“I’m innocent! Why are you looking at me like that!” Luo Tian quickly explained. When had he offended a daughter of an Epoch Master?

“Let’s overlook it for now since you’re injured. I’ll deal with you later!” Sun Mengru flew to the wisp of ashes left by Sang Tianliang. She reached out and a token emitting faint stars appeared in her hand.

“Star River Token!” Sun Mengru handed the token to Luo Tian, gazing at him. Since they entered here, they had carried this token.

“Take it,” Luo Tian shook his head lightly. Jiang Sisi took it, as he had no interest in Star River Sect’s outer sect disciples. After all, he was a disciple of the Heaven’s Top Three—Daoist Sect. Though his sect was currently in trouble.

“Okay, I’ll keep it. Let’s see if we can collect forty,” Sun Mengru shook her head. “But it’ll be hard, as so few people have arrived here. If we don’t count the Celestial Realms Alliance, there aren’t even forty of us!”

“Don’t worry. Though we’re few, many here have previously participated in the trials. This level mainly tests obtaining Star River Tokens from these old-timers,” Luo Tian said with a bitter smile.

“But the founders of Star River Sect probably didn’t expect it to appear in the Three Thousand Small Realms. We have no divine energy at all, meaning we’ll find it even harder to take Star River Tokens from them!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, his gaze turning serious.

“So our path ahead will be very difficult. Don’t overdo it. Our biggest advantage is that we can die once and leave Star River Sect, while they’ve already died once. If they die again, it’s true death! Sang Tianliang is the best example!” Luo Tian spoke softly. He would fight for it no matter what, as after exiting, they might face a major battle. Plus, the Ancient Race had reactivated the Immortal Coffin. If they obtained any divine fortune, it would be devastating.

“First, recover your strength. Strength is the key!” Luo Tian sat cross-legged on the ground, beginning to restore his over-depleted strength. Sun Mengru and the others also sat before him, guarding him while adjusting their own states—after all, they had consumed a lot too.

Three days passed in the blink of an eye. Luo Tian’s strength was fully restored through pills, but he felt no joy. The divine energy within his body had been completely drained after the battle with Sang Tianliang. To use “Sword Through Heaven” again, he would need to take another Reverse Blood Pill and drain his life force. Such a cost was too much for him.

“Let’s go!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, gazing at his three wives. The four of them wandered through the dilapidated building complex again.

“This place is too large! What was it originally?” Luo Tian asked, gazing at the ruins. He wanted to know where they were.

“We’ve walked here for almost half a month, but found nothing. We met a few previous trial participants in between and carefully avoided them. But as you guessed, not everyone here is strong—some are even weaker than Sang Tianliang!” Sun Mengru spoke to Luo Tian.

“That’s not right. How do they cultivate here? There must be a method!” Then Luo Tian suddenly realized a question, his confusion deepening.

“Hum…” As the four of them walked, a series of humming sounds echoed in their ears. A powerful aura accompanied by overwhelming pressure descended upon them, causing their faces to change instantly.

In their vision, a towering column of light pierced through the sky. Within it, figures resembling divine beasts roamed, radiating immense power.

“That’s a divine energy-formed illusion!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with intense shock. He sensed the divine energy within the column was unparalleled in his life.

“Celestial Tide!” The entire crimson battlefield echoed with cries. Those who had previously participated in the trials showed joy, shouting excitedly with burning eyes.

“This Celestial Tide is different from past ones!” Those who had stayed behind showed greed, clearly having experienced it before.

“This one is more than all past Celestial Tides combined!” People cried, rushing toward the towering column of light.

“This trial is special. Hence, the Celestial Tide has erupted early. The duration is three days, and the amount of divine energy released is ten times more than before!” A cold voice echoed in the crimson sky, causing everyone to go mad.
