“Previously, the turmoil of the Underworld Domain was merely a battlefield for us to train our tribes’ sacred heirs, but this time, I assume all of you have received the news—four Sacred Star Domains have been occupied by the Underworld. According to the Underworld’s methods, they clearly intend to absorb our domains!” Sun Shengtian sat there, speaking first. He was the one who had gathered them, so naturally he took charge.

“Indeed, this might be the greatest crisis in the history of the Nine Domains. The world has changed drastically; perhaps even a Epoch Master may emerge again. However, now we lack even those who have reached the middle stage of an epoch. Besides our foundations, only Diao Yuanshan has entered the early stage of an epoch!”

“Over these years, the Nine Sacred Masters of the Underworld are no longer merely the Nine Sacred Masters. Even the weakest, the ninth, has reached the early stage of an epoch. I suspect the remaining eight, after years of nurturing their qi, have become even stronger. It’s possible that the leader among the Nine Sacred Masters has already reached the late stage, or even the peak of an epoch!” Zhou Tianxing spoke. As the master of the Star-Weaving Domain, his words carried immense weight.

“Therefore, we must unite. This Underworld turmoil may reveal the depths of our domains’ strength. We cannot afford to be careless. Let us discuss the matter of unity! This is an inevitable trend. I assume none of you have any objections, right?” Sun Shengtian said, directing his gaze toward Diao Yuanshan.

As Sun Shengtian spoke, the other domain lords all turned their eyes toward Diao Yuanshan. He was a powerhouse of the early epoch, and the Beast Domain’s ferocious beasts were countless; its strength was terrifying.

“It might still be too early. Two domains have yet to arrive. Although the Four Sacred Star Domains were destroyed, their foundations remain intact. The Fire Domain hasn’t sent anyone either. I think we should wait a little longer,” Diao Yuanshan replied, his gaze scanning the crowd and landing on Luo Tian’s group below.

“The Four Sacred Star Domains and the Fire Domain? Heh, a destroyed domain has no right to speak of unity!” A young man spoke, his voice laced with disdain. Though quiet, the words reached every ear in the gathering, as none present were weak.

As the voice echoed, people instantly identified its source: a young man from the Thunder Domain who had remained silent for so long.

The Thunder Domain, since Li Chengen was slain by Gu Tian in a shockwave, had been somewhat disheartened. Even the ancient clan’s ritual and the divine clan’s wedding ceremony hadn’t drawn them. Yet now, this gathering of the Nine Domains had arrived.

A senior sat there, exuding the aura of a Sage at its peak. Behind him stood several disciples who had reached the late stage of sagehood. The young man was one among them.

Though the senior was at Sage Peak, he represented the Thunder Domain. Diao Yuanshan and others gave him the respect due to his station, allowing him to sit as an equal. Yet now, a disciple of the Thunder Domain had spoken so boldly, causing unease among the others. Even Zhou Wei and Yan Hongtao, disciples of domain lords, had not interjected in such a discussion. A disciple from the Thunder Domain daring to act so boldly was clearly impolite.

At once, Diao Yuanshan and the other domain lords’ expressions darkened. Their gazes toward the Thunder Domain’s people turned unkind.

“Forgive my lack of discipline. Please consider that the Thunder Domain has come with sincerity for unity. Let us overlook this boy’s words!” The overwhelming pressure made the senior of the Thunder Domain shift uneasily. He quickly rose and bowed to Diao Yuanshan and others.

Chapter 1168: Seats

On the Holy Mountain of Zhenwu Continent, the senior from the Thunder Domain wore an expression of reverence as he bowed to Diao Yuanshan and other domain lords, apologizing. He cast a sharp glance at the young man who had spoken, his eyes filled with reproach.

“Enough. Though your junior spoke poorly, he did have a point. Let us merely reprimand him this once!” Sun Shengtian smiled, stepping in to mediate.

Luo Tian stood below the mountain. Though a barrier surrounded him, it was hastily arranged to keep out commoners. It barely held against Luo Tian and Zheng Xin’s group, but the conversation above was clear to them.

Luo Tian observed those seated and smiled. Especially when he spotted a familiar figure among the crowd—Li Tianzhi, who had left the Four Sacred Star Domains with the River of Stars’ four thieves and returned to the Thunder Domain. Luo Tian and his group hadn’t expected Li Tianzhi to have risen so swiftly in the Thunder Domain, now accompanying its domain lord at this gathering. He must be at least a disciple level.

“Hmph, that kid has some moves! It’s been a while since I saw him. Didn’t expect he’d already become a disciple of the Thunder Domain! Though it’s just a Thunder Domain disciple, it’s still no small feat!” Gu Lei and others smiled, their eyes alight with excitement as they gazed at Li Tianzhi.

As Gu Lei and others marveled, the great powers atop the mountain resumed their previous demeanor. A disciple of the Thunder Domain was hardly worth their attention; they could crush him effortlessly.

“Let’s wait a bit longer. Though the Four Sacred Star Domains and Fire Domain are the weakest, they are still part of the Nine Domains. It’s reasonable,” said the Chaos Domain Lord, recalling Gu Tian’s震慑. Now he was arguably the strongest in the Nine Domains.

Though rumors had spread that Gu Tian’s time was up and he had left, no one knew where. But if he returned, who wouldn’t fear him?

“Lords of the domains, my junior’s words were indeed inappropriate. He was disrespectful to you all. However, he did have a point: the Four Sacred Star Domains only have one disciple at Sage Peak. There’s no one truly worthy to sit with you. It would be an insult for him to share your seat,” the Thunder Domain senior said, his voice respectful.

Li Tianzhi stood behind the elder, his gaze deep. He watched the elder and the young man who had spoken before, clenching his fists.

Li Tianzhi had returned to the Thunder Domain with the River of Stars’ four thieves. They were quickly accepted, especially since they were a group of warriors who had fought through blood and death—killers by nature. Their terrifying strength earned Li Tianzhi immediate top-tier treatment, and he was immediately named a disciple of the Thunder Domain.

But the Thunder Domain had only used him, sending his group to fight for them as pawns. They hadn’t expected Li Tianzhi’s talent, leading his group to conquer lands and gain fame. He earned the respect of many Thunder Domain elders, solidifying his position as a disciple of the Thunder Domain.

In short, the Thunder Domain had split into two factions: one supporting Li Tianzhi and another backing the young man, Li Yaohui. One had fought through endless battles to refine his skills; the other was a carefully cultivated disciple. Their strengths were equal, each with their own merits—neither could overcome the other.

Li Tianzhi knew that this Sage Peak elder had summoned him to take advantage of the opportunity to kill him. But along the way, no excuse had been found. Half the attendees were his allies, and the River of Stars’ army was stationed outside the domain to prevent the elder from acting treacherously.

Hearing the elder’s words, Yan Xiuluo and other domain lords furrowed their brows. The elder did have a point; Luo Tian was indeed a junior, and sitting with them seemed inappropriate.

“Hmph… what right do you have to sit among us?” Diao Yuanshan’s eyes flashed coldly as he scanned the Thunder Domain’s people. His voice was icy, then he looked toward Shen Wang Sun Shengtian. He didn’t believe a Thunder Domain Sage Peak could speak so boldly. Everyone in the Nine Domains knew his relationship with Luo Tian was no ordinary one. A Sage Peak daring to speak so boldly must have been backed by someone.

“Diao Brother, don’t be angry. We were just discussing. I still stand by my words about abandoning past grievances and uniting against our enemies. However, since the Four Sacred Star Domains and Fire Domain haven’t sent anyone, it’s clear they’re too afraid to come. So we don’t need to wait any longer,” Sun Shengtian chuckled, addressing Diao Yuanshan.

“Four Sacred Star Domains and Fire Domain. Luo Tian greets all the domain lords!” As Sun Shengtian’s words finished, Luo Tian and Gu Lei, Xu Liyi, and others leapt into the air, ascending to the mountain’s peak. They bowed respectfully toward Diao Yuanshan.

“Finally!” Young prodigies in the crowd gleamed with excitement, watching Luo Tian above.

“More terrifying!” Yan Xiuluo’s eyes narrowed, his gaze flickering with red light. His battle spirit surged.

Zhou Wei and Zhu Ge Huangchao’s expressions were heavy as they watched the seemingly unassuming Luo Tian above.

“Dare to come! What kind of courage does this Luo Tian have, coming to attend the divine clan’s gathering!” Others murmured, their gazes filled with admiration as they watched Luo Tian standing beside the domain lords.

Even Yan Xiuluo and others felt surprised by Luo Tian’s arrival. Their gazes flickered slightly, sensing the danger in him.

“What does this kid eat to grow so strong?” Diao Yuanshan smiled, but inwardly marveled. As the only one at the early stage of an epoch, Diao Yuanshan was the only one who noticed Luo Tian’s Sage Peak cultivation.

“Luo Tian!” Li Yaohui’s face darkened, his eyes filled with murderous intent. He gritted his teeth as if wanting to devour Luo Tian alive.

Shen Wang Sun Shengtian’s eyes narrowed, his gaze scanning Luo Tian before gradually calming.

“Haha, Luo Tian, I didn’t expect you to dare come. That’s quite bold of you!” Sun Shengtian spoke softly, his voice carrying admiration but also a cold edge.

“Divine King, it’s you who has the courage to set aside past grievances. That is what I should learn from!” Luo Tian bowed respectfully to the Divine King, effectively shutting Sun Shengtian’s words.

“Good. You’ve arrived. Now let us discuss how to unite the Nine Domains!” Sun Shengtian smiled, addressing everyone.

Luo Tian nodded, scanning the crowd. He glanced toward the Thunder Domain’s people before raising his hand. A chair materialized beside him, and he sat down immediately. Behind him stood Gu Lei, Zheng Xin, Xu Liyi, and others, their gazes cautious as they watched the divine clan’s people.

“Luo Tian, what are you? How dare you sit with all the domain lords?” As Luo Tian sat down, a thunderous voice erupted from among the Thunder Domain’s crowd. A bolt of lightning shot toward Luo Tian’s chair, striking it instantly.

“Boom…” Thunder rolled. Luo Tian smiled but didn’t move, remaining seated.

Yet the jade chair beneath him was struck by lightning and turned to ash, floating into the sky.

“Kid, do you have a place here?” Diao Yuanshan’s eyes flared. Two purple lightning bolts shot out—one toward Li Yaohui, the other toward the Thunder Domain’s Sage Peak elder.

Diao Yuanshan was a powerhouse of the early epoch. Who among the gathered could withstand his wrath? Though it was just a glance, it was more than the Thunder Domain’s two could endure. They immediately broke out in cold sweat, their gazes filled with fear.

“Diao Brother, this is a gathering of the Nine Domains. Let’s not fight among ourselves!” A shimmering voice echoed as Sun Shengtian appeared before the Thunder Domain’s two, effortlessly deflecting the two purple lightning bolts with a wave of his hand.

“Hmm?” Seeing Sun Shengtian effortlessly block his attack, Diao Yuanshan furrowed his brows. He looked at Sun Shengtian before his expression darkened, his gaze now more solemn.

“Haha, I don’t know what it takes to sit here,” Luo Tian smiled, addressing the crowd.

“Kid, show some strength. If we find it satisfactory, you’ll have the right!” Yan Xiuluo spoke, his gaze on Luo Tian filled with a hint of amusement. He wanted to see how different Luo Tian was now.

“Good! Li Yaohui, you showed me disrespect. I’ll start with you. If anyone objects, feel free to fight me! I Luo Tian will accept all challenges!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice filled with confidence. His gaze swept over the crowd before settling on the Thunder Domain’s two.

“Haha, I’ll take this chance to test your strength!” Li Yaohui smiled confidently, transforming into a streak of lightning and charging toward Luo Tian.

Chapter 1169: Nine Heavens’ Thunder

On the Holy Mountain of Zhenwu Continent, golden lightning surged toward Luo Tian. People were startled—Li Yaohui had acted immediately, as if he and Luo Tian bore a grudge.

“This Thunder Domain’s third disciple is quite good,” Yan Xiuluo and others smiled, watching Li Yaohui transform into lightning. Yet their expressions carried a hint of pity.

Luo Tian’s strength was deeply ingrained in everyone’s minds. Whether in the divine clan or the demon clan, he had shown strength beyond Sage Peak. Now even these domain lords felt his threat. People didn’t believe Li Yaohui could match Luo Tian.

“Is this the third disciple of the Thunder Domain? If he dies, I wonder if the Thunder Domain can produce another!” Gu Lei and others stood behind Luo Tian, smiling without moving. Even Feng Jiutian, a prodigy, had been defeated by Luo Tian. What chance did Li Yaohui have?

“Idiot,” Xu Liyi shook his head, whispering. “Luo Tian is helping that kid Li Tianzhi. Otherwise, why would he bother with these two from the Thunder Domain? He just needed an excuse to kill them!”

Lightning flashed, and a霸道 golden thunderbolt instantly appeared beside Luo Tian. Filled with lightning, the fist struck toward Luo Tian.

“Die!” Luo Tian spoke softly. Though Li Yaohui was strong, he wasn’t even in the same league as Luo Tian now. Even before reaching Sage Peak, Li Yaohui wouldn’t have matched Luo Tian. Now, with Luo Tian’s terrifying strength, he lazily threw a punch that collided with Li Yaohui.

“Crack…” In the stunned gazes of people, the golden lightning exploded into arcs of electricity, vanishing from sight. Blood mist rose as Li Yaohui’s body was annihilated by Luo Tian’s single punch.

“What happened?” People stared at the shattered lightning and blood mist being refined by divine power, their faces filled with awe.

“One punch! Just one punch!” Even Zhou Wei and Yan Hongtao hadn’t expected Luo Tian to kill Li Yaohui in one punch.

Though Li Yaohui’s strength was weaker than Zhou Wei and others, he wasn’t someone easily crushed. They themselves admitted they couldn’t do it.

“Third one! The Thunder Domain, what else do you have? Bring them out! Let that Li Tianzhi come here! Haha!” Gu Lei and others sneered at the Thunder Domain’s elder, who was now ashen-faced. They even directed their taunts toward Li Tianzhi.

“Damn it!” Li Tianzhi cursed inwardly. These bastards, but he kept his face cold and stood still.

“Thousand Dao Paths! This kid has mastered the thousand Dao Paths!” Diao Yuanshan and Sun Shengtian were also stunned, watching Luo Tian. They hadn’t expected him to fully master divine power.

“Li Feichen of the Thunder Domain wishes to test!” The Thunder Domain elder roared, his body flashing into the sky. His gaze was filled with fierce killing intent as he looked at Luo Tian.

“Old fool, thinking you’re a powerhouse? Just a Sage Peak. Do you think you can kill me?” Luo Tian spoke softly, his gaze filled with disdain toward Li Feichen.

“You’re no more than a Sage Peak. What right do you have to be arrogant before me? Killing my Thunder Domain disciples repeatedly—this hatred is unending!” Li Feichen gritted his teeth, lightning bolts swirling around him like serpents.

“Who said I’m a Sage Peak?” Luo Tian’s aura gradually rose, different from his previous calmness. If before he was a tranquil lake, now he was a raging sea—Sage Peak’s wild aura radiated from him.

“Ah, I see. Luo Tian has entered the Sage Peak! That’s why he killed Li Yaohui so easily!” People were stunned, amazed by Luo Tian’s rapid cultivation.

Sun Shengtian furrowed his brows. His eyes flashed with divine light, scanning the elders and disciples of various sects in the Divine and Demon Domains. His gaze was solemn.

Seeing Sun Shengtian’s eyes, the old elders of the Divine and Demon Domains who had lived long lives knew what he meant. They wouldn’t be ignorant of his intent.

“I, the Yin-Yang Sect, don’t believe you have the right to sit with all the domain lords!” Two elders of the Yin-Yang Sect spoke first, their gazes filled with killing intent. They had previously clashed with Luo Tian but held back due to Diao Yuanshan’s strength.

But now, with the divine clan as their support, they had grown bolder. Their desire to kill Luo Tian was rekindled.

“Luo Tian, I’ll definitely kill you today!” Two disciples of the Yin-Yang Sect and one other disciple, all at Sage Peak, spoke in unison.

“I, the如意宗 (Ruyi Sect), also disagree… I, the万象楼 (Wanxiang Building), won’t accept it either!” With the Yin-Yang Sect leading, other sects of the Divine and Demon Domains also stood up. Some sects had old grudges with Luo Tian; others simply wanted to make a good impression on the divine clan.

But some merely watched the situation carefully. After all, Luo Tian’s past chaos in the divine clan had become a shadow in people’s minds. Especially with Gu Tian’s overwhelming strength, which exceeded everyone’s expectations. If Gu Tian returned, even the divine clan would be in trouble.

Fifteen people surrounded Luo Tian, blocking all his escape routes. Ten were at Sage Peak; five were at Sage Mid-Stage. All stared coldly at Luo Tian.

“Hmph, a bunch of riffraff!” Luo Tian looked at the fifteen people with disdain. He sent a silent message to Diao Yuanshan, stopping him from attacking.

“Kill!” Luo Tian’s spear, Lietian, was in hand. He knew he would have to unleash a massacre again. But he didn’t regard these people as threats—after all, he had killed Feng Jiutian, a Sage Peak, and even replicated eight of them through the Demon Emperor Mirror. These people were no more threatening than five Feng Jiutians.

This time, Luo Tian decided not to use the Yin Fish but rely solely on his strength to kill them. He knew he needed to show enough power to make these people fear him, otherwise they wouldn’t respect him or the Four Sacred Star Domains.

“Since you don’t allow me to sit, I’ll push you down and take your seat!” Luo Tian spotted his target and rushed toward Li Feichen of the Thunder Domain.

“Lightning Summoning Art!” Seeing Luo Tian attack, Li Feichen’s face changed. A prodigy was one who could match others of the same level. So Li Feichen immediately unleashed his strongest attack.

Golden lightning fell from the sky, seemingly ordinary but filled with terrifying pressure. People’s faces turned serious.

Diao Yuanshan and Sun Shengtian attacked, sealing Luo Tian and others in a barrier. Such an earth-shattering battle could destroy the entire Zhenwu Continent if not controlled.

“One… ten… a thousand…” Over a thousand golden lightning bolts intertwined, sweeping toward Luo Tian. His face showed slight tension; he felt familiar energy within these lightning bolts.

“Kid, no matter how strong you are, can you defy heaven? This Lightning Summoning Art isn’t ordinary lightning—it’s the Nine Heavens’ Thunder. Each bolt contains the essence of heaven. I heard you were once suppressed by heaven. Let’s experience that again!” Li Feichen sneered, speaking to Luo Tian.

“Suppressed by heaven? Just because you have a bit of heavenly essence, do you think you can suppress me? You really overestimate yourself!” Luo Tian replied coldly. Divine power surrounded his spear.

“Then add us to the mix,” others smiled, looking at Luo Tian who was resisting the Nine Heavens’ Thunder. They unleashed waves of power from their hands.

“That kid, a mere Sage Mid-Stage, dares to make Luo Tian fight? I’ll kill you!” Zheng Xin cursed, rushing toward a disciple among the fifteen.

“Long time no fight. I’ve been lonely! Meeting this kid, I get to fight again. It’s quite exciting!” Diao Yuanshan’s companion, Diao Dezhu, smiled with the loneliness of a master. He transformed into a streak of purple lightning and rushed into the barrier, targeting a Sage Mid-Stage disciple.

As for Long Jie, he was even more arrogant. His imperial dragon qi surrounded him as he descended to a disciple preparing a martial technique, his gaze filled with endless coldness.

Nan Gong Yuyu’s blood-red sword flew from the Demon Lord’s side. After time, Nan Gong Yuyu’s sword had evolved into a pseudo-epoch treasure like the ancient heavenly palaces.

Others also rushed toward their respective opponents. After Long Jie’s actions, only three Sage Peak disciples remained—though one was a disciple of the Yin-Yang Sect who had used the Yin-Yang Life Curse to reach Sage Peak.

“Yin-Yang Sect? Yin-Yang Elders?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows. Among these people, the most feared were the four from the Yin-Yang Sect. As a sect second only to the divine and demon clans, their powerful techniques were well-known.

“Regardless, let’s kill this old bastard from the Thunder Domain first!” Luo Tian muttered, his gaze on Li Feichen’s lightning net. His eyes flashed with fierce battle spirit as he spun Lietian, creating countless spear shadows around him. Each shadow was real.

“Thousand Dao Paths!” Luo Tian roared, launching three thousand spear shadows. Each contained a different Dao power, making his spear technique terrifying.

Chapter 1170: Repelling

Three thousand spear shadows collided with Li Feichen’s lightning net imbued with a hint of heavenly essence. A thunderous explosion echoed, and the sky was filled with divine power clashing against heavenly essence.

Though Li Feichen’s Nine Heavens’ Thunder contained heavenly essence, it was still man-made. Compared to the true heavenly essence Luo Tian had once endured, its power was much weaker. With Luo Tian now fully mastering the thousand Dao Paths, his divine power was complete and could withstand this hint of heavenly essence.

Disintegration. In the stunned gazes of people, three thousand spear shadows and the lightning net collided and vanished into thin air. Golden light spread, obscuring Luo Tian’s group.

Golden light shimmered as Luo Tian’s face flashed with coldness, bathed in golden lightning. He located Li Feichen and ignored others’ attacks, instantly appearing beside him. A golden fist filled with infinite pressure struck toward Li Feichen.

The Thunder Domain, due to its nature, was skilled in speed. But Luo Tian’s speed was too fast. By the time Li Feichen reacted, Luo Tian’s fist had already struck.

“Lightning Fist…” Li Feichen roared. He could sense the terrifying power in Luo Tian’s fist. If he was hit, even if he survived, he would be severely injured.

It was now impossible to dodge. Li Feichen channeled all his strength and swung a fist toward Luo Tian.

“Crack…” Next moment, Li Feichen’s body was blasted backward. Cracks formed on his body, and the lightning-imbued fist shattered, spreading across his body. He crashed into the barrier Diao Yuanshan and others had set up, causing the holy mountain to tremble.

While Luo Tian blasted Li Feichen away, others’ attacks also thundered toward him. The two elders of the Yin-Yang Sect and the disciple of the Yin-Yang Sect, who had combined their techniques to unleash the Yin-Yang Dao Map and Yin-Yang Great Seal, attacked Luo Tian.

On the other side, the elder of the Wanxiang Building transformed into an ancient demon elephant and stomped toward Luo Tian with a thick leg.

“Divine King Nine Heavens’ Diagram!” Luo Tian remained calm. Using the Divine King Nine Heavens’ Diagram combined with the Brahman Attack Technique, he unleashed it toward the Yin-Yang Sect’s techniques.

“Boom…” The thunderous explosion echoed. The massive diagram clashed with the Yin-Yang Sect’s techniques, creating an invisible turbulence that vanished from sight.

The thick elephant leg slammed onto Luo Tian. Luo Tian had already blocked Li Feichen and the Yin-Yang Sect’s three attacks, leaving no time to block the Wanxiang Building’s attack. He could only endure it with his body.

“Boom…” The leg, like a mountain, felt as if crushing an ant. The elder of the Wanxiang Building’s face lit up with joy.

The technique was destroyed, and the black demon qi consumed Luo Tian. People speculated that such a terrifying technique would surely injure Luo Tian.

“Damn it!” Sun Shengtian’s face darkened. He watched the Luo Tian obscured by black divine power, knowing he was alive. Moreover, the Divine King Nine Heavens’ Diagram Luo Tian had used was one of the three divine techniques of the divine clan, usually reserved for direct disciples. Now it had been used by Luo Tian with complete power—nine heavy heavens’ pressure, stronger than some divine clan disciples.

“Impossible! He’s unharmed?” Li Feichen, after falling from the barrier, felt his body radiating lightning to heal himself. Then he sensed Luo Tian’s powerful aura still unweakened, his eyes filled with disbelief.

The two elders of the Yin-Yang Sect and the disciple who had combined their strength to attack Luo Tian also changed expressions. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian’s power to have reached such a level. Even with their combined strength, they hadn’t injured Luo Tian but had instead allowed Li Feichen to be nearly killed.

“Hum…” A humming sound rose. The black demon qi gradually dissipated, revealing a golden light that burst out of it. Luo Tian’s lips bled, like a blazing sun, as he appeared before everyone with Lietian in hand.

At the moment Luo Tian emerged, Li Feichen felt a sudden tightness. A strong sense of danger surged in his heart. Without hesitation, he summoned lightning beneath his feet and vanished from the spot.

“Can’t escape!” Luo Tian’s Lietian instantly pierced into the void. His cold voice echoed in the void, like a death god, causing Li Feichen to tremble.

“Hum…” The void cracked open without sound, appearing behind the moving Li Feichen. A golden spear shadow, like an arrow, pierced through Li Feichen’s back.

“Boom…” As people were amazed that Luo Tian had suffered no real injury, Li Feichen was turned into a blood mist, spreading across everyone’s sight. His golden soul screamed in agony, being refined by divine power and vanishing from view.

“Death!” With Li Feichen’s death, the Thunder Domain truly faced a catastrophe. Its disciples and elders had both fallen to Luo Tian’s hands.

“Luo Tian has truly brought misfortune upon the Thunder Domain!” People marveled, watching Li Feichen being completely refined by divine power.

“Powerful!” People again witnessed Luo Tian’s strength. A Sage Peak was completely crushed by him. Who in the Nine Domains could balance Luo Tian, except for those at the half-epoch stage?

“Now it’s your turn!” Luo Tian gazed at the remaining four from the Yin-Yang Sect and the elder of the Wanxiang Building, his eyes filled with killing intent. His cold voice echoed like a demon’s chant in their hearts.

“Damn it, Luo Tian! Don’t act so high and mighty. I’m about to die!” As Luo Tian prepared to attack the Yin-Yang Sect and Wanxiang Building, another battle reached its peak. However, it was the group of Zheng Xin that suffered.

Fighting against a Sage Peak with only a Sage Mid-Stage was impossible. If not for their extraordinary techniques, they would have been killed in one clash. Now, they barely held on. If it lasted longer, their lives would be at risk.

Zheng Xin, Gu Lei, Xu Liyi, even Long Jie were pale and battered. Yet they had killed five disciples of the Sage Mid-Stage, leaving people astonished. Not only was Luo Tian incredibly powerful, but his companions were each prodigies—strong enough to become a dominant force if they grew.

Seeing their condition, Luo Tian’s face darkened. He looked at the few Sage Peaks surrounding them: “Now it’s too late to regret. If they die, you won’t live either!”

Luo Tian’s voice echoed in the ears of the Sage Peaks. The elders attacking Long Jie and others paused.

Though they had been distracted by Long Jie and Gu Lei, they had felt Luo Tian’s power when he killed Li Feichen. The scene terrified them.

Luo Tian’s displayed strength had a powerful deterrent. Killing a Sage Peak so easily, they didn’t believe they were stronger than Li Feichen—some even felt inferior. If Luo Tian turned his attention to them, they had no confidence in surviving.

They had only attacked to please the divine clan. But if they died at Luo Tian’s hands, that was truly death. After living so long, who didn’t value life?

“Now, stop. I’ll overlook this!” Luo Tian’s cold expression remained as he sensed their inner conflict and spoke again.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, they exchanged glances. They bowed to Luo Tian and stopped attacking Long Jie’s group. Their meaning was clear.

“Come on, fight each other! Fighting a Sage Mid-Stage with a Sage Peak—just ask who else?” Seeing the Sage Peaks fear Luo Tian, Diao Dezhu didn’t miss the chance to mock. He stood before Zheng Xin’s group, his posture straight and proud, his gaze fierce and superior, as if he had repelled the Sage Peaks himself.

“Go to hell! You ran faster than anyone!” Xu Liyi and others cursed inwardly but didn’t speak aloud. After all, Diao Yuanshan was there; cursing Diao Dezhu had to be done carefully.

“Idiot!” Diao Yuanshan swung his hand, slapping Diao Dezhu’s head. At the same time, he pulled Diao Dezhu and Long Jie closer.

“Now it’s your turn!” Luo Tian looked at Long Jie’s group, now safe. His face showed a fierce expression as he gazed at the Yin-Yang Sect’s elders and disciple, and the elder of the Wanxiang Building.

“You’re doomed!” Their faces darkened. Luo Tian’s displayed strength had exceeded their expectations. If they continued, they doubted whether they would survive Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian, from now on, the Yin-Yang Sect and you will have no more enmity. Our grudge is erased!” The Yin-Yang Sect elder spoke, knowing there was no need to continue fighting. The Wanxiang Building’s elder also stood with the Yin-Yang Sect, their meaning clear—they didn’t want to fight anymore.

“I said I would overlook this with them, but I never said the same for you. No grudge? You’re not worthy!” Luo Tian’s killing intent increased, his Lietian emitting a buzzing sound. He moved toward the three.

“You!” Their faces changed abruptly, not expecting Luo Tian to refuse their offer.

“Fight!” They saw Luo Tian’s fierce killing intent and knew he had no intention of letting them go. That glimmer of hope vanished completely. They exuded powerful auras and rushed toward Luo Tian.

Chapter 1171: Unity

On the Holy Mountain of Zhenwu Continent, the two elders of the Yin-Yang Sect and disciple, along with the elder of the Wanxiang Building, looked at Luo Tian with fierce eyes as he charged toward them.

“Kill!” They knew Luo Tian was truly determined to kill them. Thinking this, they moved swiftly, their hands glowing with radiant light. Three techniques surged toward Luo Tian.

“Divine King Nine Heavens’ Diagram!” As he flew, Luo Tian remained calm. With his left hand, he unleashed the Divine King Nine Heavens’ Diagram; with his right, he struck with the Dao-Repelling Fist toward them.
