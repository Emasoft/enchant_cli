Three had just swallowed the elixir, slightly regaining their strength, when they planned to unleash their power and completely refine Ming Xi Hong's blood, leaving no chance for him to rebirth through blood.

At the very moment they took a step forward, Ming Xi Hong also appeared with a pale face, his eyes cold as he gazed at Luo Tian and the three.

"I never thought I would have this day of blood rebirth!" Ming Xi Hong's face twisted with a sinister expression. Having lived so long, he never imagined that his current cultivation would leave him in such a desperate state.

In the late era of the Epoch, he was rare across the Origin Domain. Yet now, he had nearly been crushed to death. Though it was the projection of a Sovereign that attacked him, he still could not accept it.

"You should have no more tricks now!" Ming Xi Hong surveyed the three, then his body surged with power as he rushed toward Luo Tian and the others.

"Your strength has dropped significantly; what right do you have to be so arrogant before me?" Luo Tian's eyes burned with battle spirit. His wounds exuded a green glow, though his injuries were worse than Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang's, he recovered much faster.

"Boom..." At that moment, Luo Tian clashed with Ming Xi Hong again, their attacks colliding in a thunderous roar that drowned out the fierce lightning.

"Kill!" Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang also recovered, their eyes filled with killing intent as they rushed toward Ming Xi Hong.

Four figures clashed repeatedly, colliding endlessly. Though Ming Xi Hong's cultivation had declined and his strength was damaged, he still dominated Luo Tian and the others. After all, their injuries were more severe than his.

"Damn it! If my cultivation hadn't declined, I could have killed the three of you with just three punches!" Ming Xi Hong's heart boiled with frustration. He never expected things to turn so dire.

"You! If it weren't for you, I wouldn’t be in this situation!" Ming Xi Hong struck Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang back with a punch, his eyes filled with endless hatred as he glared at Luo Tian, his gaze brimming with killing intent.

"Yin-Yang Reversal!" Ming Xi Hong's hands formed a seal, spitting out a stream of blood. He despised Luo Tian to the core and was willing to sacrifice his own essence to kill him completely.

The blood, tinged with gray mist, transformed into a crimson Dao diagram that smashed toward Luo Tian. This was Ming Xi Hong's ultimate strike, its power terrifying.

"Divine King Nine Heavens Diagram!" Luo Tian felt the overwhelming pressure of the crimson Dao diagram and showed a weakened expression. He raised his hand to unleash the Divine King Nine Heavens Diagram, but with his current state, its power was greatly diminished.

"Boom..." The Yin-Yang Reversal diagram crashed down, slamming into the Divine King Nine Heavens Diagram. In an instant, the latter shattered.

"It's over!" Luo Tian sighed longingly as the crimson diagram descended upon him, knowing that if it struck him, he would either die or be severely wounded.

"Reincarnation Immortal Body!" Luo Tian realized he had no choice but to activate his final secret technique, the Reincarnation Immortal Body, to avoid this fatal strike.

"Boom..." The crimson diagram descended instantly, and Luo Tian's body was immediately turned into a mist of blood, scattering from Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingyue's sight.

" Soul Extraction!" Ming Xi Hong extended his hand, a terrifying suction instantly enveloping Luo Tian's blood.

"Ah..." Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang rushed forward, attacking Ming Xi Hong. They had just witnessed Fu Xingchen's death at this very technique.

"Buzz..." At the moment Ming Xi Hong acted, Luo Tian's figure instantly coalesced again, his face pale and breathing heavily.

Chapter 1324: Ming Xi Hong's Demise ()

"Impossible! He's unharmed!" Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang stared in shock at Luo Tian's body instantly coalescing.

"A life-immortality secret technique?" The three realized Luo Tian must have mastered a life-immortality secret technique to be in this state.

"Ah cough..." Luo Tian coughed violently, his eyes showing weakness as he gazed at Ming Xi Hong and retreated.

Luo Tian knew his current state was extremely poor; both of his Reincarnation Immortal Bodies had vanished, and regaining them would take much time.

Though his Epoch energy still remained within him, it was far weaker than before, barely reaching one or two percent.

"The cost is too great!" Luo Tian muttered in his heart, knowing he had done everything possible. The rest would have to rely on Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingyue, for his further actions would only be suicide.

"Count on you!" Luo Tian addressed Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingyue, stepping far away before sitting in the void, activating his Reincarnation Heaven Art to recover the lost Epoch energy.

"Let's fight!" Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang also noticed Luo Tian's state, their faces showing a fierce determination. Without hesitation, they rushed toward Ming Xi Hong.

The thunderous clash resumed. Though Ming Xi Hong's power was undeniable, the cost of killing Luo Tian had been great, causing his strength to drop by a third. This made Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang's battle less exhausting.

Time passed slowly, vast spaces annihilated by their attacks. After another half-hour of combat, Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang gradually felt their strength waning. Their faces turned pale, bodies flying backward as they exhaled gray mist to hinder their wounds from healing.

"Ah, these three are truly tenacious!" Ming Xi Hong panted heavily, his body also in disarray. His previous composure had vanished.

"I almost failed today against you three; if it were known, it would be a disgrace!"

"I'll send you to your deaths now!" Ming Xi Hong sneered, rushing toward Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang with a massive hand. His overwhelming power was still enough to kill the two, who had no chance of retaliation.

"It's over! This time truly over! No tricks left!" Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingchen laughed bitterly, their eyes gazing toward the Thunder Sea Petal, a hint of bitterness in them.

Luo Tian also slowly opened his eyes, his gaze equally bitter. He had no tricks left either; from the beginning of the battle to now, he had exhausted all his techniques.

"Die!" A gray hand, brimming with destruction, descended upon Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang's heads.

"Kid, don't be in a hurry; it'll be your turn soon. And that girl who went to refine the Divine Emperor's Mandate, I'll enjoy her first before sending her to join you!" Ming Xi Hong's face twisted with a sinister grin.

"Boom..." But as Ming Xi Hong's words fell, a series of thunderous roars echoed within Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang's bodies, as if an invisible energy was circulating within them.

Their previously exhausted bodies radiated powerful fluctuations, sending waves toward Luo Tian and Ming Xi Hong's vision.

"It's the Divine Emperor's Mandate!" Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang's eyes flashed with intense joy, their bodies instantly vanishing from the spot.

"Boom..." The gray hand that had nearly killed Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang missed entirely.

"Xingxuan has refined the Star Moon Divine Emperor's Mandate!" Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingyue's brief bitterness faded, their voices shouting.

At the same time, all of Star Moon Divine City's people felt their blood energy stirring violently. A surge of blood energy erupted from their bodies, gathering toward the Thunder Roar Palace.

"Someone has refined the Divine Emperor's Mandate! Who is it? One of the three princes?" Star Moon Divine City was completely shaken, their eyes filled with excitement as they flew toward the Thunder Roar Palace again.

Fu Tianba's face showed a slight smile, his gaze toward the Thunder Roar Palace as he whispered, "I'm very curious who it is!"

Not only Fu Tianba, but also Fu Tianqing and the three Epoch Peak attendants of Star Moon Divine City felt their blood energy strengthen. Their blood energy surged from their bodies, and they too were curious about who had refined the Star Moon Divine Emperor's Mandate.

"Damn it! It was that annoying girl who refined it!" Ming Xi Hong's eyes flashed with murderous intent. After hiding for nearly a millennium, his goal was ruined by these young people, pushing him near madness.

"Even if she refined it, I'll still extract her!" Ming Xi Hong raged, his body rushing toward Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingyue again.

"Go away..." A cold voice echoed through the empty space, a purple lightning bolt appearing in Luo Tian's and the three's vision.

"Xingxuan, run!" Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingyue's faces changed, shouting at Fu Xingxuan with urgency. They hadn't expected her to appear on her own.

But soon, Luo Tian noticed that Fu Xingxuan seemed like a different person now, her purple eyes radiating authority. This made Luo Tian feel a strange illusion; this Fu Xingxuan wasn't the real one.

A powerful pressure emanated from Fu Xingxuan, making Ming Xi Hong's face show a serious expression.

"Ugly girl, don't play games with me. Your strength has increased a lot, but you're still not worth my time!" Ming Xi Hong said this way, but his face was serious. This Fu Xingyue in the Thunder Roar Palace gave him a dangerous feeling.

"My third brother's grudge isn't easy to settle!" Fu Xingxuan pointed her finger, an invisible fluctuation forming in her hand. It transformed into a powerful storm that rushed toward Ming Xi Hong.

Meanwhile, the blood energy from Star Moon Divine City's people converged into a single blood dragon, rushing toward the Thunder Roar Palace's gate.

"What's happening? Why is this blood energy attacking the Thunder Roar Palace?" People were confused, watching the seemingly mad blood energy.

"I remember when the current Divine Emperor obtained the Star Moon Divine Emperor's Mandate, there wasn't such a commotion!" People showed confusion, watching the thunderous Thunder Roar Palace gate.

"Did something unexpected happen?" People whispered among themselves, and the blood energy erupted violently, smashing open the Thunder Roar Palace's gate. Rolling thunder roared out.

"The Thunder Roar Palace has opened!" People's eyes showed anticipation, standing respectfully waiting for their new emperor to appear.

"Roar..." The blood dragon roared and rushed into the Thunder Roar Palace.

At this moment, Fu Xingxuan and Ming Xi Hong clashed fiercely. Fu Xingxuan radiated terrifying energy, her aura surpassing half of the Epoch level. Her purple eyes flashed with endless coldness; every attack was a death strike, even forcing Ming Xi Hong into a desperate situation.

It wasn't that Fu Xingxuan was particularly strong, but Ming Xi Hong's current state was too weak. Though he was still in the middle of the Epoch, after battling with Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue's two prodigies, he had no choice but to pay a price.

"Die!" Fu Xingxuan pointed her finger, and the blood energy from Star Moon Divine Clan people instantly reached Fu Xingxuan's front. It transformed into a crimson dragon, roaring toward Ming Xi Hong.

This dragon radiated overwhelming power,凝聚 the blood energy of all Star Moon Divine Clan people. Though it was just a fragment, it was still beyond Ming Xi Hong's ability to resist. Even if he were at his peak, he couldn't withstand it because of the blood energy from three Epoch Peak attendants.

Crushing, the crimson dragon materialized and instantly crushed Ming Xi Hong's body. In the stunned gaze of Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue, Ming Xi Hong's body exploded into a mist of blood, completely devoured by the crimson dragon and vanishing from their sight.

"Ah..." The three sighed deeply, feeling utterly drained as they collapsed to the ground, their faces showing relief.

"That was a late Epoch level cultivator! He's gone like that!" Luo Tian's face was pale, gazing at the crimson dragon with admiration.

"Third brother, may you rest in peace!" Fu Xingxuan pointed her finger, and the crimson dragon rushed into her body. Fu Xingxuan's face turned pale; clearly, the battle with Ming Xi Hong had taken a heavy toll on her.

Fu Xingxuan didn't absorb all the blood energy but only a part of it, then waved her hand to send the remaining toward Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang.

"Boom..." Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang's bodies trembled, then their eyes softened as they sat cross-legged to recover their injuries.

As for Luo Tian, Fu Xingxuan paused briefly before sighing and sending a portion of the blood energy to Luo Tian's body.

Luo Tian sighed deeply, gazing at Fu Xingxuan with a smile: "Thank you!"

Luo Tian didn't hesitate, sitting cross-legged to absorb the intense blood energy and repair his battered wounds.

Chapter 1325: Fu Tianba Arrives ()

Time passed slowly, and after half an hour, Luo Tian and the three finally recovered most of their injuries. They then exchanged glances with each other.

Especially Fu Xingyue's gaze was deep, filled with understanding only he and Luo Tian could grasp. Even Fu Xingxuan didn't understand their meaning.

"Speak up, why did you impersonate Xiao Ding? Or why did you use two identities to enter our Star Moon Divine Clan?" Fu Xingxuan addressed Luo Tian, her aura subtly carrying the demeanor of a ruler.

Hearing Fu Xingxuan's words, Fu Xingyue's body trembled. He didn't know this Xiao Ding was his commander but thought it was Luo Tian, only because Luo Tian had saved them. He hadn't exposed the truth.

Fu Xingyang was also stunned, thinking it was just Xiao Ding hiding his strength and being able to walk the Seven Steps.

"Princess Xingxuan, don't be so serious; I prefer the old you. This version isn't cute at all!" Luo Tian shrugged, since Fu Xingyue hadn't exposed him, he could still keep up the charade.

Luo Tian waved his hand, and Fu Mengchen's appearance appeared before the three, leaving Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang speechless.

"Meng... Mengchen" Fu Xingyue's eyes showed disbelief, never expecting Fu Mengchen to be Luo Tian and also Xiao Ding.

"Fu Mengchen!" Fu Xingyang softly spoke, never expecting Xiao Ding to be Fu Mengchen. However, it was within Fu Xingyang's acceptance range.

Fu Xingxuan's face also slightly changed, her gaze turning to Luo Tian with complex emotions.

"Speak up, why did you do this?" Fu Xingxuan softly asked, her voice carrying confusion.

"Because of you! You kept troubling me repeatedly; I had no choice. If you knew I was Xiao Ding, you would have peeled my skin!" Luo Tian's eyes showed a bitter smile as he replied to Fu Xingxuan.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Fu Xingxuan's face turned red, recalling her past torment of Luo Tian. She didn't continue speaking.

Only Fu Xingyue's face was more complex, gazing at Luo Tian. He knew it wasn't as Luo Tian said; among the three, only he understood that Luo Tian was human and didn't want to be too prominent, fearing attracting Star Moon Divine Clan's attention.

"Everything was a lie? You tricked me?" Fu Xingyue trembled, addressing Luo Tian. He had intended to ask this when they were alone, but Fu Xingyue couldn't hold back and asked it out loud.

"Some were lies, some were true! Otherwise, I wouldn't have risked my life to protect you!" Luo Tian sighed deeply, answering Fu Xingyue in a voice only they could hear.

"Second brother, what are you two talking about?" Fu Xingxuan looked puzzled at Fu Xingyue.

"Nothing, it's better this way!"

"I haven't congratulated you yet, you little brat! We three fought so hard, and it was you who took the prize!" Fu Xingyue adjusted his mindset, addressing Fu Xingxuan.

"I think it's the best outcome!" Fu Xingyang's eyes sparkled, showing a hint of exhaustion. He then gazed at Fu Xingyue.

"Yes, the best outcome. For me, it doesn't matter; I only focused on cultivation. If not for my subordinates, I wouldn't have fought for it!"

"But I have a question to ask you, elder brother! Who attacked me after I returned from the蛮族?" Fu Xingyue's eyes carried scrutiny as he looked at Fu Xingyang. This question had been in Fu Xingyue's heart for a long time.

Originally, Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang hadn't been too eager to compete for the Divine Emperor position, but this incident had completely changed Fu Xingyue's thoughts.

"Someone attacked you?" Hearing Fu Xingyue's words, Fu Xingyang's eyes flashed with danger.

"Who?" Fu Xingxuan's face also changed, never expecting Fu Xingyue to have encountered such a situation.

"I don't know. If not for the hidden power aiding me, you wouldn't have known about my death until now!" Fu Xingyue shook his head gently.

"It wasn't me!" Fu Xingyang then softly replied, shaking his head lightly. His gaze met Fu Xingyue's.

"I, Fu Xingyang, have killed countless people in my life; people say I'm cold and heartless. But I would never kill my own brother!" Fu Xingyang's voice was resolute, his gaze fixed on Fu Xingyue the entire time.

"Could it be the third brother?" Fu Xingyue's face showed confusion, then he shook his head gently.

"It wasn't the third brother. The third brother told me he was just不服 you two and didn't have any intention of harming you!" Fu Xingxuan's face flashed with a hint of sorrow, recalling the image of Fu Xingchen dying for her. She didn't want Fu Xingchen to be labeled as a brother-killer.

"冥族!" Luo Tian softly spoke, his voice carrying hatred and resentment. Being an outsider, he quickly discerned the situation and softly spoke.

"冥族!" Hearing Luo Tian's words, Fu Xingyue and the others' faces also showed a hint of killing intent. The name of the冥族 wasn't good among the ancient royal clans.

"It's clearly the冥族 trying to incite conflict between the royal clans! It's so simple!" Luo Tian softly spoke, from the various signs in the Thunder Roar Palace, the冥族 had targeted the蛮族 and Star Moon Divine Clan first, almost succeeding.

"Yes, if we hadn't resisted Ming Xi Hong, the Star Moon Divine Emperor's Mandate would have already fallen into Ming Xi Hong's hands!" Fu Xingyang, the most meticulous among the three, nodded slightly.

"What happened?" As the four spoke, a furious voice echoed in their ears, shaking their minds.

"Respect the Emperor!"

"Respect the Divine Emperor!" Hearing this voice, Luo Tian and the three quickly bowed in reverence, gazing at the entrance of the Thunder Roar Palace.

Two flashes of light appeared before them, Fu Tianba and Fu Tianqing's figures emerging in front of the four. Their faces were dark with anger.

"Where is the third brother?" Fu Tianba's gaze was deep, scanning Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang. His eyes showed a hint of disappointment, assuming they had killed Fu Xingchen for the throne.

"Father!" Seeing Fu Tianba's arrival, Fu Xingxuan felt like she had found her anchor and immediately rushed into his arms, crying loudly.

"Rebel!" Fu Tianba swung his hand, fiercely slapping Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang. His face was furious.

"Smack..." A green hand struck their bodies, nearly knocking them dead.

"You've disappointed me so much!" Fu Tianba shouted angrily, his entire body seeming to age a bit. He took heavy breaths.

"A mere Star Moon Divine Emperor's throne made you do such things, killing your own brother! What use are you to me? Will you kill your father next!" Fu Tianba was clearly furious, speaking more and more angrily, even developing a killing intent. His hand swung again, fiercely slapping Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang.

"Fu Tianba, don't be impulsive; things aren't as you think!" Fu Tianqing's eyebrows slightly furrowed, seeing Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang's hesitant expressions. He quickly blocked Fu Tianba.

"Uncle, don't block me! These rebels are better off dead!" Fu Tianba spoke to Fu Tianqing, his domineering aura even making Fu Tianqing speechless.

"Idiot!" Fu Tianqing swung his hand, slapping Fu Tianqing's face and cursing loudly.

"Ugh..." Luo Tian was speechless, watching these two for the first time. He had never seen Fu Tianqing so angry before.

"You didn't even ask what happened, just slapped them! Who taught you to do that!" Fu Tianqing couldn't help but shout.

"You did, you never stopped slapping me! I was raised by you; who else would I learn from!" Fu Tianba mentally muttered but didn't say it aloud. He then saw Fu Xingxuan crying in his arms, frowning slightly.

"Xingxuan, it's you who refined the Divine Emperor's Mandate?" Fu Tianba was stunned, never expecting Fu Xingxuan to have refined the Divine Emperor's Mandate.

He had sent Fu Xingxuan in to keep an eye on the three sons, preventing them from doing anything reckless.

"Yes! Third brother died; he sacrificed himself to save me!" Fu Xingxuan cried, then burst into tears again.

"You two bastards! You even wanted to..." Hearing Fu Xingxuan's words, Fu Tianba's eyes turned red. His killing intent was fully ignited.

"Dad, it's not what you think!" Fu Xingyang shouted loudly but was met with Fu Tianba's furious hand.

Luo Tian sighed bitterly, watching Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang being beaten by Fu Tianba. He quickly approached Fu Tianqing, explaining the entire situation.

"冥族? Ming Xi Hong!" Hearing Luo Tian's words, Fu Tianqing's eyes immediately turned serious. He flew to Fu Tianba's side and slapped him again.

"Stop!" Fu Tianqing shouted, addressing Fu Tianba. If he didn't stop, Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang would truly be beaten to death.

"Father, it's not what you think!" At this moment, Fu Xingxuan also fully recovered and stopped them.

"Hmm?" Hearing their words, Fu Tianba's face showed confusion as he gazed at Fu Xingxuan.

Fu Xingxuan quickly spoke, recounting the entire incident to Fu Tianba, deepening his killing intent.

"冥族! This isn't over!" Fu Tianba coldly spoke, his body flashing away from their sight.

Chapter 1326: The Seal to the Nine Domains ()

Seeing Fu Tianba's killing intent rushing out of the Thunder Roar Palace, Luo Tian and the others were stunned in place.

"We're innocent!" Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang cried out, their heads nearly knocked off by Fu Tianba.

"Big brother, second brother, I'm sorry!" Fu Xingxuan's face showed self-reproach as she addressed Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang, feeling like she had almost caused their deaths.

Seeing Fu Xingxuan's teary eyes, the two brothers were exasperated but said nothing. It was no use talking.

"Master, can you take us to see the seal to the Nine Domains?" Luo Tian addressed Fu Tianqing, his voice filled with excitement.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Fu Xingyue, Fu Xingyang, and Fu Xingxuan's bodies trembled slightly. Though they were princes and princesses, they had never seen the seal to the Nine Domains in Star Moon Divine Clan.

"Good, soon Star Moon City will be under your control; it's also time for you to see it!" Fu Tianqing sighed deeply, addressing the three.

"This Thunder Sea Petal's back is where the seal lies; I suppose you already know it. I'll take you there!" Fu Tianqing waved his hand, sending twenty moon lightning stones to Luo Tian's front.

"Refine them! To prevent accidents!" Fu Tianqing addressed Luo Tian, though he knew Fu Mengchen was Xiao Ding, he still took care of Luo Tian as a true disciple.

"Yes!" Luo Tian bowed in reverence, activating his Reincarnation Heaven Art to refine the moon lightning stones. In a moment, twenty of them were completely refined by his powerful Reincarnation Heaven Art.

"Two Reincarnation Immortal Bodies, restored!" Luo Tian sighed in admiration, feeling his two Reincarnation Immortal Bodies fully recovered. Even the second one was close to being solid; after a short period of cultivation, he would definitely fully consolidate it.

"Come on! Follow me closely; even though you've refined the moon lightning stones, some places are still dangerous!" Fu Tianqing addressed the four, his body flashing toward the center of the Thunder Sea Petal.

Terrifying lightning surged around them, but it didn't strike their bodies.

Fu Tianqing turned left and right, his face gradually showing seriousness. A wild aura swept over Luo Tian's group, making their minds excited. Their eyes stared intently at Fu Tianqing, fearing one wrong step would result in being struck by the terrifying lightning and turned to ashes.

They flew for a quarter of an hour before finally reaching the crack where lightning was constantly erupting. A transparent barrier appeared in Luo Tian's vision.

Though the barrier looked thin, Luo Tian could see through it to the other side, where destructive lightning roared.

A suppressing aura emanated from the barrier, even making Fu Tianqing show respect.

"This barrier was set by a great sage of the human race, known as the Intercepting Heaven Lord. It was this Intercepting Heaven Lord who subdued all ancient royal clans and sealed them within the Origin Domain," Fu Tianqing's eyes showed a hint of bitterness.

"Damn humans! We were treated like slaves and food, yet dared to subdue us!" Fu Xingyang's face showed coldness, his teeth clenched.

"Ah..." Fu Xingyue sighed deeply, gazing at Luo Tian with more complex emotions.

"Indeed, we did suppress humans too harshly. After the first Epoch Lord emerged, humans began to rise rapidly!" Fu Tianqing sighed softly.

"This is the entrance to another domain of the Nine Domains, the Thunder Domain!" Fu Tianqing clearly knew much and directly revealed where this seal led.

"Thunder Domain!" Luo Tian stood outside the barrier, gazing at the lightning constantly erupting within. Though he had guessed it before, he was still excited. Especially being so close, Luo Tian could feel the wild energy of the Thunder Domain, a unique aura belonging to the Nine Domains.

"This opening was created by Star Moon Divine Clan using all their strength and a Sovereign's weapon, taking advantage of its weakness. But we never expected that at the time, another human sage appeared again, like the Black and White War God. He used a black and white Dao diagram to fill it back up, leaving only this small opening that couldn't be passed through!" Fu Tianqing pointed his finger outward at the crack, a black and white Dao diagram appearing. He sighed softly.

"This is!" Luo Tian followed Fu Tianqing's finger, his entire mind trembling.

A massive barrier had a small black and white Dao diagram on it, seemingly insignificant but containing immense power. It filled in part of the seal!

"Divine Demon Dao Diagram! The Divine Demon Lord also came to the Origin Domain!" Luo Tian's shock was immeasurable, his heart also excited. He never expected to encounter the Divine Demon Lord's Dao Diagram here.

Luo Tian had once possessed the Yin Fish Spirit, so he could recognize the Divine Demon Dao Diagram. At this moment, it had transformed into a Taijitu pattern, suppressing the barrier. However, there were no black and white yin-yang fish in the diagram.

"Finally found something to communicate with the Nine Domains!" Luo Tian's heart shouted, but he quickly calmed down.

"To take the entire Divine Demon Dao Diagram is impossible; the methods of the Divine Demon Lord and Intercepting Heaven Lord are beyond my comprehension. But to extract some black and white energy, I should be able to do it!" Luo Tian muttered in his heart, rushing toward the Divine Demon Dao Diagram.

"Kid, what are you doing!" Fu Tianqing's face suddenly changed when he saw Luo Tian move. He never expected Luo Tian to act so abruptly.

"Buzz..." Before Fu Tianqing's words finished, Luo Tian's body instantly reached the Divine Demon Dao Diagram. His eyes showed madness as he rushed toward it with both hands.

"Kid, you're crazy! Stop now; doing this will cost your life!" Fu Tianqing's body flashed, chasing after Luo Tian.

"Give it to me!" Luo Tian touched the Divine Demon Dao Diagram, and instantly, black and white energy erupted from it. Two long dragons of black and white appeared, which Luo Tian extracted.

"Boom..." At the moment Luo Tian touched the black and white energy, destructive lightning erupted from the Yin-Yang Fish eyes of the Divine Demon Dao Diagram, enveloping Luo Tian.

"It's over!" Fu Tianqing arrived quickly and left just as fast, instantly returning to Fu Xingyue's group. He created a barrier to protect them.

"That kid is dead! We Star Moon Divine Clan had strong people who wanted to open the black and white diagram, but they were struck dead! Leaving a single ember of lightning!" Fu Tianqing sighed softly. The lightning that even Fu Tianqing feared was now surrounding Luo Tian, who vanished from their sight.

"Why is he so crazy!" Fu Xingxuan's eyes showed confusion, never expecting Luo Tian to act like a madman upon seeing the black and white diagram.

"Ah..." Fu Xingyue sighed deeply, knowing that Luo Tian was human; the black and white diagram might be of great use to humans.

"Ah..." Luo Tian felt intense pain, his entire body paralyzed. Even with his Reincarnation Immortal Body activated, it couldn't solve this situation.

"I was too careless!" Luo Tian felt regret for his impulsiveness, but there was no way back. He couldn't give up; he wouldn't stay in the Origin Domain forever. Now that there was an opportunity, how could he not try?

"Ah..." Luo Tian roared loudly. His two Reincarnation Immortal Bodies in his dantian emitted a bright white light, filling his entire body.

"Boom... Boom..." However, the two Reincarnation Immortal Bodies then collapsed again, causing Luo Tian's defense to drop instantly.

"Ziziz..." At the moment the two Reincarnation Immortal Bodies collapsed, intense pain surged through Luo Tian's entire body. He endured for one breath before falling into unconsciousness.

"Buzz..." The Epoch's power swept across, golden Epoch books radiated light, sweeping out from Luo Tian's body. It seemed to suppress everything, even the lightning that made Fu Tianqing hesitate instantly retreated back into the Yin-Yang Fish eyes.

"Impossible! He's still alive!" Fu Tianqing's eyes flashed, gazing at Luo Tian who was completely blackened and falling down like a charcoal. But he still had a last bit of life left.

"Ten Thousand Life Rebirth Art!" Fu Tianqing pointed his fingers, a powerful life energy instantly grabbed Luo Tian's charred body. The life energy rushed into his body.

"Buzz..." Feeling the powerful life energy in Fu Tianqing's technique, Luo Tian's body instantly emitted a glowing green light. Like withered trees reviving, he slowly recovered.

"What is this body made of? Just by stimulating the Ten Thousand Life Rebirth Art, it recovered so quickly!" Fu Tianqing was shocked, watching Luo Tian's body recover.

"Let's go! This kid needs some time to recover!" Fu Tianqing grabbed Luo Tian, continuously nourishing his broken body with his cultivation. He addressed Fu Xingxuan and the others.

"Ah!" Fu Xingyue and the others nodded, gazing at the terrifying thunder sea outside the barrier. Their eyes showed curiosity about what lay beyond the Origin Domain.

The four moved quickly, but it still took half an hour to exit from the Thunder Roar Palace.

"Out!" As they exited, all the people watching Star Moon Divine Clan were stunned, gazing at Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang.

Chapter 1327: The First Divine Empress ()
