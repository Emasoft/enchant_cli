Luo Tian seized Hu Jianhua in his grasp, his eyes brimming with menacing intent as they locked gazes.

“It’s all right, it’s all right!” Hu Jianhua's heart trembled with fear as he gazed at Luo Tian, seeing him like a demon. He quickly extended his hand, passing the storage bag to Luo Tian’s hands.

Luo Tian made no pretense; he snatched the storage bag with a single hand, his face lighting up with a grin. “Hmph, no wonder you’re the second attendant; compared to those two paupers, you’ve got far more wealth!”

As a cultivator, Hu Jianhua was vastly richer than Sun Shaojun and Meng Xingyuan. His wealth rivaled the sum of theirs, but what thrilled Luo Tian most was that within Hu Jianhua’s storage bag, he discovered a sacred medicine.

“Ahem, Deputy Island Master,” Shen Gongfu’s fatty jowls quivered as he addressed Luo Tian. “Since Hu Attendant has been so magnanimous, let me handle these matters personally. Don’t let such trivialities trouble the Deputy Island Master.”

“Island Master jests,” Luo Tian replied with solemnity, as if willing to sacrifice everything for the Third Island. “Upon my arrival at Seven Star Island, I’ve long wished to do something for the Third. This is but a minor matter—let me handle it myself.”

“Deputy Island Master, your diligence is commendable!” Shen Gongfu finally relented under the gaze of the Third Island’s disciples.

“Island Master, placing the Seven Star Trembling Demon Cauldron in your care holds no real value. Let me safeguard it for you instead. This artifact is priceless; I fear your ceaseless toil might risk its safety.” Luo Tian’s expression remained calm as he spoke.

Chapter 1250: Courtyard Bustling with Visitors

“Get out!” Shen Gongfu’s jowls quivered as he saw Luo Tian’s gaze upon the Seven Star Trembling Demon Cauldron. That look was all too familiar—like his own when he beheld Qi Stones. Shen Gongfu knew well the allure of the Seven Star Trembling Demon Cauldron for cultivators.

“Island Master…”

“Go… no way! You still want to rob me of my medicinal cauldron!” Luo Tian and Shen Gongfu exchanged rapid mental words. Eventually, Luo Tian was forced to pay hundreds of Qi Stones in tribute before Shen Gongfu relented, allowing him a half-month lease on the Seven Star Trembling Demon Cauldron.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian felt as if he’d fallen into a bottomless pit, watching his Qi Stones vanish like water into Shen Gongfu’s pockets.

“Hmph, truly fortunate,” Shen Gongfu mused with pride. “That kid’s remarkable—he actually activated the Seven Star Trembling Demon Cauldron. No one in ages has managed it. His strength has improved, and he’s even earned me money!”

“Enough, everyone,” Luo Tian smiled as he addressed the Third Island’s disciples. “It’s late; return to your quarters and rest. Tomorrow I’ll continue refining elixirs—feel free to observe!”

“Deputy Island Master, rest well,” the Third Island’s disciples and cultivators respectfully replied before dispersing to their lodgings.

“Sigh…” Luo Tian sat on the ground, weary, watching Lin Xiuzhe and Yang Jinghua who had not left. He noted that Yang Jinghua’s aura had stabilized, a faint smile crossing his lips.

“Hmph…” Luo Tian exhaled deeply and sat cross-legged, beginning to recover.

As Luo Tian closed his eyes, the starry sky fell silent. That night was not only Luo Tian who sat in the ruins; many Third Island disciples also rested there. For cultivators, shelter was optional—yet they paid no heed.

Time flowed slowly. Dawn’s sunlight illuminated the Third Island, a low roar awakening its people—a vast Qi vortex materialized above the island.

Luo Tian opened his eyes, seeing Yang Jinghua with long hair飞扬, his face alight with excitement as he stood there, allowing the violent Qi vortex to batter his body.

“What’s going on? Is someone coming to trouble the Deputy Island Master again?” The Third Island’s disciples frowned. Sensing the disturbance emanating from Luo Tian, they rushed toward him.

“Have you no shame? Do you think this is your home to come and go as you please?” The Third Island disciples roared, now regarding Luo Tian as one of their own.

“If anyone dares trouble the Deputy Island Master, I Zhang Changliang swear I’ll stop refining elixirs for that island!” One disciple roared.

“Indeed, it’s too much!” Others echoed, their voices brimming with anger.

But when they arrived at Luo Tian’s side, it was not what they feared—it was Yang Jinghua, the Third Island’s top prodigy.

The colossal vortex stirred the heavens and earth, its roar shaking the entire Seven Star Island. All who gazed upon it bore expressions of awe.

“He’s ascended! Yang Jinghua has reached Half-Epoch!” The crowd gasped, their eyes alight with excitement.

“Finally, I’ve reached Half-Epoch!” Yang Jinghua’s face bore a touch of exhilaration as he gazed at Luo Tian, his eyes filled with gratitude. He leapt forward, rushing toward Luo Tian.

“Hah!” Luo Tian laughed aloud, his golden body surging forward to meet Yang Jinghua. As he flew, a golden fist swung toward him.

Yang Jinghua laughed wildly, his aura thunderous. A crimson fist met Luo Tian’s golden one in a collision.

“Boom…” Yang Jinghua was hurled back, his lips bleeding as he landed on the ground. His clenched fist bore fine cracks that trembled before returning to their original state.

Luo Tian, however, returned calmly to his spot without disturbing a single grain of dust. His eyes still held a smile as he silently nodded—Yang Jinghua was truly a prodigy.

“Another duel?” The crowd’s eyes gleamed with excitement, speculating who would prevail in the clash.

Yet their disappointment was swift; after one punch, Yang Jinghua did not continue his assault. His demeanor seemed lighter, and he bowed to Luo Tian before nodding at Ning Xiuzhe, then took flight with him toward the Second Island.

“From now on, whoever opposes Luo Tian shall oppose me, Yang Jinghua!” Yang Jinghua’s cold voice echoed across the Seven Star Island, leaving all in awe.

Yang Jinghua, the Third Prodigy of the Seven Star Island, his name renowned and victories countless. Even the elders of the Epoch Stage had personally granted him privileges; Yang Jinghua held the right to execute first and report later.

To “execute first and report later” meant that if Yang Jinghua deemed someone unworthy, even their death would be justified as an enemy of the Seven Star Island. No island master held such authority—evident of Yang Jinghua’s esteemed status among the elders. The Seven Star Island knew that with Yang Jinghua present, human forces would never falter in the Sea’s Edge battlefield. Only Yang Jinghua could command the respect of human warriors there—neither Guan Xingjian nor Hu Tianzong could achieve this.

“With Yang Jinghua’s protection, no one would dare oppose the Deputy Island Master!” The crowd sighed in admiration, gazing at Luo Tian with envy.

“Everyone, I’ll begin refining elixirs shortly—feel free to observe. If there are any flaws in my methods, you may point them out; let’s exchange insights instead of isolating ourselves. This will surely benefit all cultivators!” Luo Tian smiled as he addressed the crowd, then struck his palm. Flames surged into the Seven Star Trembling Demon Cauldron—after all, it was a rented artifact; to waste it would be foolish.

As Luo Tian continued refining elixirs, the Third Island’s disciples watched intently, praising and learning from his techniques. Luo Tian’s elixir art was of the Nine Domains, far superior to that of the蛮族 continent.

Soon, Luo Tian’s courtyard became lively with activity—disciples frequently attempted elixirs, inviting others to observe and critique.

Time flew swiftly; this exchange conference spread across the entire Third Island, with daily visitors seeking discussions on elixir arts.

At the same time, Luo Tian’s name became renowned throughout the Seven Star Island. He had refined an elixir that propelled Yang Jinghua into Half-Epoch, defeated the Third Island’s two attendants, and even challenged the Fourth and Fifth Islands’ top attendants. Whether in strength or elixir art, Luo Tian had become a legend within the Seven Star Island. Soon, he was equated with Hu Tianzong and Guan Xingjian in prestige.

“Regretfully, Guan Xingjian has left the Seven Star Island, and Hu Tianzong is in seclusion—there’s no chance to witness who is stronger!” The crowd murmured, their disappointment palpable.

“Damn it… Damn it!” Hu Jian’an stood in his courtyard, shouting repeatedly, his voice laced with resentment.

“Elder Brother, we can only wait now—wait for Tianzong to emerge from seclusion and crush that kid. No one else will help us now,” Hu Jianhua’s eyes were bitter.

“Hmph, if Tianzong reaches the Early Epoch, that kid is nothing!” Hu Jian’an’s anger eased slightly upon hearing of Hu Tianzong.

The Third Island’s Elixir Conference lasted a month, during which Luo Tian refined his elixir art significantly, benefiting immensely.

Luo Tian’s courtyard was not repaired—too many visitors arrived daily, overwhelming his original space. Conflicts over positions arose frequently.

During the month, the Fourth and Fifth Island Masters also visited the Third Island before departing in anger. The entire Third Island heard their scolding of Shen Gongfu as a heartless merchant, leaving the Third Island’s people to sigh in exasperation.

Luo Tian had already handed over the two Seven Star Swords to Shen Gongfu, who negotiated with the two Island Masters. Yet Luo Tian knew well that Shen Gongfu’s nature would have made them pay a hefty price to retrieve the swords. Their pale faces and furious shouts confirmed Shen Gongfu’s extortion beyond their initial agreement.

A month of peace passed, but on the thirty-first day, Luo Tian noticed a sharp decline in visitors. He felt secretly pleased yet puzzled.

Moreover, the Third Island’s disciples who arrived seemed anxious and hesitant, deepening his confusion.

“Fey!” Luo Tian called out to Shen Gongfei, who stood amidst the crowd with a flushed face. These past days, Shen Gongfei had been radiant—truly Luo Tian’s envoy.

“Deputy Island Master, what happened on the island these past days?” Luo Tian asked Shen Gongfei, his voice laced with curiosity.

“Understood!” Shen Gongfei obeyed without hesitation, his plump body darting through the crowd and vanishing from Luo Tian’s sight.

“Enough,” Luo Tian sighed, resolving to cease refining elixirs after today and discuss with Shen Gongfu whether he could view the Seven Star Island’s preparations for entering the Nine Domains. Otherwise, without such resources, he could never return to the Nine Domains.

In the evening, Luo Tian smiled as he addressed the disciples: “Enough, everyone—this is the final day of exchange. Tomorrow I’ll begin my cultivation!”

“Deputy Island Master, we’ll depart then!” The disciples respectfully replied before leaving.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian watched them go, his palm sweeping outward. Golden sacred energy surged from his hands, forming a courtyard that mirrored his former residence. He sat cross-legged on the bed, his eyes contemplative.

“I wonder how the Nine Domains fare now,” Luo Tian murmured, having been away for nearly three months. He felt homesick.

“Damn it… this cursed Origin Domain!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, pondering how to return swiftly.

“Unless I lead the human forces of the Seven Star Island to conquer the蛮族, seize their Divine Temple, and attempt to unlock the封印 of the Intercepting Heaven Master, or if I reach the Peak Epoch like Elder Dongbo Xin!” Luo Tian’s eyes darkened with contemplation.

“Peak Epoch! If I could reach it swiftly, a thousand years might suffice… but only with opportunities!” Luo Tian’s eyes bore a faint smile.

At that moment, in the Nine Domains, Gu Qianxue, Leng Qiuchan, Jiang Sixi, and Sun Mengru waited endlessly for Luo Tian. Four women, each prodigies in their own right—especially Sun Mengru, whose body was one of the Nine Great Constitutions, the Primordial Divine Body. Her cultivation had soared rapidly, now reaching Half-Epoch—she was the second to enter Half-Epoch after Luo Tian in the Four Saints Star Domain.

“Be careful,” Luo Nan Tian and his wife sighed, watching their four daughters-in-law. Only these four women, along with Luo Tian’s parents and Luo Xiong, knew that Luo Tian was still alive.

They believed Luo Tian had suffered heavy injuries and was hiding to recover. If those with ill intentions discovered this, Luo Tian might be in danger.

Though now Luo Tian was renowned across the Nine Domains as a hero, he had many enemies. If his survival and injury were known, who could say what sinister thoughts might arise? Thus, Luo Xiong had instructed them to keep it secret—no one must know Luo Tian was alive, not even Gu Lei.

“Rest easy, Father and Mother—we’ll find him and return!” The four women bowed to Luo Nan Tian’s couple before vanishing into the Celestial Origin Continent, heading toward their former domain of冥域 in search of clues.

“Perhaps there’s another path—find Elder Dongbo Xin and have him return me to the Nine Domains!” Luo Tian thought of another way back, though it was equally desperate.

“Deputy Island Master, may I enter?” As Luo Tian pondered, Shen Gongfei’s voice echoed from outside.

Shen Gongfei entered Luo Tian’s room, his face grim. His gaze met Luo Tian’s: “Deputy Island Master, I know why so few disciples came today.”

“Speak,” Luo Tian smiled as he addressed Shen Gongfei. He knew it was unlikely to be good news.

“Hu Jian’an and Hu Jianhua spread the word that Hu Tianzong is emerging from seclusion. He’ll surely trouble you!” Shen Gongfei’s face bore worry. Though Luo Tian was formidable, Hu Tianzong’s power had deep roots in the Seven Star Island. Since his emergence, he had only one defeat—when he lost to Guan Xingjian in a single move.

“Ah, I see,” Luo Tian nodded without concern for Hu Tianzong, confident in his strength.

“Is that all?” Luo Tian asked Shen Gongfei.

“Yes, and about Guan Xingjian—some days ago, he left the Seven Star Island to seek a Peak Epoch elder’s inheritance. However, it seems unsuccessful. The old guardian of the魂灯 noticed Guan Xingjian’s魂灯 flickering, indicating he faced a crisis!” Shen Gongfei explained.

“Guan Xingjian is our Seven Star Island’s prodigy, his future boundless. The First Island Master personally dispatched an elder to find and rescue him!” Shen Gongfei continued.

“Guan Xingjian?” Since encountering the蛮江 and蛮海 brothers, Luo Tian had heard this name so often it was worn thin.

“Yet strangely, this time Guan Xian’s departure was extremely secret—only the First Island Master knew. Moreover, his concealment skills were strong; how could he be discovered by the蛮族?” Shen Gongfei’s face bore confusion, murmuring.

“Hmph…” Luo Tian paused slightly before recalling the incident where the蛮江 and蛮真 brothers mistook him for Guan Xingjian. He vaguely sensed this situation might relate to himself.

“Hear, Guan Xingjian encountered a蛮族 prodigy and nearly killed them—hence his exposure. No one knows how the蛮族 discovered him, leading to their pursuit!” Shen Gongfei’s eyes glowed with admiration for Guan Xingjian’s strength.

Luo Tian rubbed his nose, his expression awkward. Upon hearing Shen Gongfei’s explanation, he was certain Guan Xingjian’s exposure was indeed connected to himself.

“Must stay hidden! If Guan Xingjian discovers this, it’ll be a major trouble!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly.

“Deputy Island Master, prepare yourself—rumors say Hu Tianzong will emerge within seven days. You’ve treated Hu Jian’an and Hu Jianhua harshly before; he’ll surely seek you out!” Shen Gongfei warned.

“Hmph, don’t worry,” Luo Tian nodded lightly, his expression indifferent. He didn’t seek trouble but neither did he fear it. If Hu Tianzong wished to cause issues, he wouldn’t mind giving him a lesson.

Shen Gongfei reiterated his advice before departing from Luo Tian’s room.

“Let them be! No one can stop me returning to the Nine Domains!” Luo Tian murmured, his body radiating waves as he began cultivation.

The next morning, some disciples came to Luo Tian’s courtyard seeking elixir lessons but were turned away, leaving them disappointed.

“Did you hear? Hu Tianzong is emerging! After his emergence, he might trouble the Deputy Island Master!” The Third Island buzzed with whispers.

“I support the Deputy Island Master! Since arriving at the Third Island, I’ve seen his elixir refinement—my skills have improved greatly!” One disciple voiced support.

“But Hu Tianzong is a prodigy, and the Deputy Island Master might lose… if he loses, his reputation may fall. After all, strength is the ultimate truth!” Another disciple doubted Luo Tian’s chances.

The entire Third Island discussed the inevitable clash between Hu Tianzong and Luo Tian, eager to witness who would prevail. They knew if Luo Tian won, his position as Deputy Island Master would be unshakable; conversely, if Hu Tianzong won, he might replace Luo Tian, rendering all his previous prestige meaningless.

“How’s it? Don’t you feel nervous about Hu Tianzong emerging?” Shen Gongfu smiled as he addressed Luo Tian.

Seeing Shen Gongfu’s grin, Luo Tian felt an urge to stomp on that merchant’s face.

“No, I just want to see what preparations the island made for returning to the Nine Domains,” Luo Tian shook his head, directly stating his purpose.

Upon hearing this, Shen Gongfu’s eyes narrowed before sighing softly: “You finally spoke. I thought you’d wait a few days more!”

“You are now one of the Seven Star Island, and as Deputy Island Master, you have the right to know this secret. However, first ensure your position is solid—then I’ll take you later.” Shen Gongfu smiled.

“Fine, then I’ll wait a few more days!” Luo Tian nodded and left Shen Gongfu’s residence, his eyes confident.

“Prodigies—how many have I killed?” Luo Tian inwardly sneered, clenching his fist. His greatest goal was returning to the Nine Domains—no one could stop him. Any chance, no matter how slim, he would try.

Under the respectful gazes of the Third Island’s people, Luo Tian returned to his quarters, his eyes contemplative.

“Hu Tianzong is a prodigy and highly esteemed; he must have two swords. I should prepare more—don’t want to fail in a ditch!” Luo Tian waved his hand, summoning several ancient formulas from the stone fortress.

“Better to enhance my strength!” Luo Tian activated the Seven Star Trembling Demon Cauldron, intending to refine those ancient formulas and test if he could further elevate his strength.

Chapter 1251: Hu Tianzong Challenges!

The Seven Star Island people assumed Luo Tian would retreat into silence, but instead, he became even more audacious by refining elixirs. This time, however, he did not allow the Third Island’s disciples to watch but set up a barrier. No one knew what Luo Tian was doing, only that his courtyard’s sky was filled with various colors of lightning without pause, terrifying.

“Is the Deputy Island Master refining an elixir so extraordinary?” The Third Island’s people marveled and speculated.

“Perhaps it will enhance his strength. Hu Tianzong is no ordinary Half-Epoch—Deputy Island Master must feel pressure!” They discussed, eagerly awaiting the clash between these two prodigies.

“Success!” After three days of intense effort, Luo Tian stood in his courtyard with bloodshot eyes, a look of ecstatic joy.

“Crushing Blood Elixir, Supplementing Heaven Elixir, Nine Orifice Elixir!” Luo Tian gazed at the three jade vials in his hands—his achievement after days of meticulous refinement and countless wasted herbs.

“Crushing Blood Elixir enhances bloodline strength, Supplementing Heaven Elixir boosts the soul, and Nine Orifice Elixir strengthens the body!” Luo Tian murmured, his eyes alight with joy.

Luo Tian’s bloodline, body, and soul were all far beyond ordinary. If he could elevate one more level, he was confident in facing the Early Epoch.

“Hu Tianzong! If you’re not at the Early Epoch, I’ll crush you!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with a grin as he sat cross-legged on his bed, swallowing the three elixirs to refine their power.

“Roar…” Three-colored dragons surged into Luo Tian’s body, sending waves of excruciating pain through his entire form.

“Sigh… the ancient formulas from the蛮族 are great, but they’re hard to digest!” Luo Tian’s forehead broke into a cold sweat as he closed his eyes, continuing to refine the fierce medicinal energy.

In a cave of the Third Island, a black-haired youth sat on a jade bed, his aura constantly flowing. His face bore an intense expression.

“Boom… boom…” Thunderous sounds echoed, followed by a series of booms rising from the Third Island. Black clouds instantly enveloped it, turning day into night.

“Thunderstorm!” Hu Jian’an and Hu Jianhua’s faces lit with excitement. They knew thunderstorms meant what—especially sensing the suffocating pressure within those black clouds, they couldn’t help but laugh.

“Hah! Early Epoch—Tianzong is entering the Early Epoch! If he does, no one in the Third Island can match him. Not even Luo Tian!” Hu Jian’an roared, his resentment vanishing with the thunderstorm’s arrival.

“Early Epoch—Hu Tianzong?” Shen Gongfu furrowed his brows, sensing the thunderstorm’s unusual nature.

The entire Seven Star Island, not just the Third, trembled as all six islands watched Hu Tianzong.

“Come!” Hu Tianzong roared, his aura surging violently. Invisible power formed waves that battered the surroundings, shattering the cave and revealing the black clouds above. His eyes held no fear but battle fervor.

“Not enough!” Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, awakened by the powerful fluctuations. He gazed at the black storm clouds and shook his head.

Luo Tian could sense that Hu Tianzong, though strong, still lacked completeness in his aura. He needed more cultivation to reach the Early Epoch.

“If he succeeds, Guan Xingjian’s title as top prodigy may be relinquished. Hu Tianzong is the earliest to reach Early Epoch in the Seven Star Island!” First Island Master Tong Yangjian sighed, his voice tinged with admiration. Yet he didn’t believe Hu Tianzong would reach the Early Epoch—he was an Early Epoch elder himself, having once endured a thunderstorm. The memory still chilled him.

Under the gaze of all seven islands, golden lightning danced within the black clouds but did not descend. It seemed to deliberate whether to attack this tiny human.

“Come on!” Hu Tianzong roared, his voice shaking the heavens. He longed to ascend to Early Epoch strength.

But then, the black clouds swirled and dispersed instead of unleashing thunder.

“No descent!” The Seven Star Island people sighed in disappointment, watching the black clouds vanish swiftly.

“Damn it!” Hu Tianzong’s eyes flashed with frustration but ultimately resignation—he knew he was still one step short of thunderstorm.

“Since so, Luo Tian, dare you face me?” Hu Tianzong roared toward Luo Tian’s residence, his voice echoing across the Seven Star Island.

“Previously, you insulted my elders; now I’ll crush you beneath my feet!” Hu Tianzong didn’t wait for Luo Tian’s reply, his voice laced with coldness.

Hu Tianzong had known of Luo Tian’s actions during his seclusion and now, upon emerging, sought to reclaim his Deputy Island Master position and avenge Hu Jian’an and Hu Jianhua.

“Direct challenge!” The Seven Star Island people’s eyes gleamed with excitement, gazing toward Luo Tian’s residence.

“Deputy Island Master won’t avoid battle; it would harm his cultivation and lose prestige across the Seven Star Island!” They spoke, awaiting Luo Tian’s response.

“Then, three days later—Seven Star Terrace!” Luo Tian opened his eyes after hearing Hu Tianzong’s challenge, responding with battle fervor. He could sense that this Hu Tianzong was no ordinary foe—his ability to summon an Epoch-level thunderstorm, though it didn’t descend, proved his extraordinary potential. He was but a step away from Early Epoch strength.

“Good, I’ll wait for you!” Hu Tianzong stood in the sky, his face unusually solemn. He too sensed Luo Tian’s tenacity; within him, he felt a powerful aura flowing—his instincts warned of an impending threat. It was as if a mighty dragon were awakening. This sensation, Hu Tianzong had only felt once before—when facing the top prodigy Guan Xingjian.

Their verbal clash ignited a frenzy across the Seven Star Island, people’s faces alight with excitement as they gazed toward them, awaiting their battle.

“Three days should suffice!” Luo Tian closed his eyes slowly, continuing to refine the fierce medicinal energy within him.

Hu Tianzong also sat cross-legged, his aura gradually calming as he adjusted his state. He sensed this Luo Tian was another formidable opponent besides Guan Xingjian.

“Hu Tianzong, be careful!” As both fell silent, a crimson sword flew from the Second Island. It cut through stars and moons, radiating overwhelming blood qi toward Hu Tianzong’s Third Island.

“Is it Yang Jinghua? I heard he and Luo Tian are close—perhaps he’s coming to defend Luo Tian!” The crowd gasped, watching the crimson sword that seemed to cleave heaven and earth.

“Hmph, you’ve reached Half-Epoch!” Hu Tianzong opened his eyes instantly, a smile on his face. He extended his hand, and a gray spear shot forth from it, meeting the crimson sword in collision.

“Ah! It’s the Illusory Dragon Spear—Hu Tianzong’s weapon, once used to slay a dragon and replace its soul with the spear!” The crowd murmured in awe, recognizing the gray spear.

“Crack…” Thunderous collisions echoed as the two legendary weapons clashed, sending them flying back to their masters.

“Is this a warning?” The crowd understood that Yang Jinghua and Luo Tian were close; if not for Luo Tian’s elixirs, Yang Jinghua might still be at the Saint Stage. He had once said that anyone who harmed Luo Tian would be his enemy—this statement was clearly true!

“Take care,” Yang Jinghua spoke, his voice authoritative. He and Hu Tianzong locked eyes across the distance.

“Regretfully, Guan Xingjian isn’t on the island; if he were, it would be truly interesting!” The crowd’s eyes gleamed with excitement but also regret.

After speaking, Yang Jinghua said no more, slinging the crimson sword over his back before vanishing from the Second Island.

Luo Tian, meanwhile, ignored their exchange and focused entirely on refining the medicinal energy within him. His body radiated red light, as if transcending into a higher state.

“Hmph, can we make another deal?” Shen Gongfu stood in his courtyard, grabbing Shen Gongfei and dragging him into his space. Their plump bodies huddled together, whispering and occasionally laughing with cunning.

Time flowed slowly; before they realized it, three days had passed. The entire Seven Star Island’s people rushed to the Seven Star Terrace, where Luo Tian and Hu Tianzong’s battle was known by all. Many had arrived early to secure seats.

“Come on, come on! Bet two-to-one for Hu Senior’s victory; three-to-one for Luo Tian!” Soon, the Seven Star Terrace was surrounded by stalls. Disciples shouted loudly, trying to attract bets.

Chapter 1252: Battle Against Hu Tianzong

The Seven Star Terrace was packed with people. Stalls lined the area, their vendors shouting loudly, leaving the Seven Star Island’s people in disbelief. Who would have thought such a situation could inspire bets?

“Kid, I’ve bet everything on you! If you lose, I’ll be ruined!” Shen Gongfu smiled as he appeared at the Seven Star Terrace.

“Third Island Master!” The crowd respectfully greeted him.

“Old Third, this is your doing again—when did you learn to make money?” As Shen Gongfu arrived at the terrace, six figures appeared in front of him. Their eyes smiled as they looked at Shen Gongfu.

“Hmph, no profit without risk!” The Third and Fourth Island Masters sneered at Shen Gongfu, recalling his recent extortion of them with the Seven Star Swords. They felt a pang of pain.

“Haha, how about you all play for fun?” Shen Gongfu’s eyes lit up as he addressed the six island masters.

“Hmph, I’ll make you bankrupt!” The Third and Fourth Island Masters walked toward a stall, their hands waving to deposit two thousand Qi Stones for Hu Tianzong’s victory.

“Luo Tian and Hu Tianzong’s battle has even drawn the attention of several island masters!”

“Of course! Their strength rivals that of Half-Epoch island masters. With such youth, they’ll surely become the Seven Star Island’s pillars. How could they not be respected?” The crowd murmured, watching the island masters on the terrace—especially First and Second Island Masters, their faces filled with reverence.

“I bet myself, two thousand Qi Stones!” As the crowd murmured, a loud voice echoed. Hu Tianzong’s long hair flew as he appeared before them, tossing a storage bag to the stall.

“Here he is—Hu Tianzong Senior!” The crowd erupted in chaos, their faces filled with reverence as they gazed at Hu Tianzong.

“I bet two thousand, for Luo Tian’s victory!” As the crowd regained composure, Yang Jinghua’s blood-soaked figure appeared before them.

“Yang Jinghua!” Hu Tianzong’s eyes flickered, his gaze on Yang Jinghua before he shook his head.
